1
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,718
Long live Mian Tansen!

2
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,892
Long live the maestro!

3
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:50,002
Disperse

4
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,018
Tell the guards at the door
there must be no disturbance

5
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:23,366
Tell the constable, there must be
no music playing around the palace

6
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:25,871
l need complete silence

7
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:54,062
Wonderful maestro, wonderful!
l could die to hear that tune

8
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:25,027
Sounds like thundering clouds.
- Thunderous rainclouds!

9
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:32,196
Wonderful modulation!

10
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,045
Wonderful! Maestro, you are our Tansen!
There's music even in the way you cough

11
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:50,556
Bless you

12
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,785
Go on, maestro!

13
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:14,836
Stop singing!
- Why should l stop?

14
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:20,512
l have my admirers too.
- lf you want to sing, go elsewhere

15
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:25,688
You are not to create any disturbance.
- Not even breathe?

16
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:31,862
Mind your tongue! The court musician
Mian Tansen, is scoring a new Raga

17
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:35,689
You will not scream into his ears.
- l know all about scoring music!

18
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:39,363
Take the Raga Todi, change a few notes
and he creates music! Mian's Todi

19
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,540
Twist Raga Malhar, and he scores
Mian's Malhar!

20
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,141
Now he's adding a twist to Raga Kanara
to create Darbari Kanara. Get lost!

21
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:51,876
Silence! Create trouble, and you will
be forbidden to sing in this area!

22
00:06:58,257 --> 00:07:02,660
Here come the bards.
Let's see you stop them!

23
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,660
Stop! Singing isn't allowed here

24
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,991
This isn't a song. This is a prayer.
- Whatever! Mian Tansen is scoring music

25
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:20,668
Singing in this area is forbidden.
By his orders!

26
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:27,676
Music is the essence of life.
Never can there be any restrictions

27
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:48,697
What are you staring at?
Stop them!

28
00:09:05,351 --> 00:09:08,980
We are free men!
Do not mess with us

29
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:19,164
Son...

30
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,335
Baiju, my son...

31
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:33,345
My son...

32
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:39,681
you must never forget
what happened

33
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:45,184
lf ever time favours you...

34
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:49,692
you must take revenge against Tansen
for your father

35
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,632
You must avenge!

36
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,201
Your word! Give me your word, son!

37
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,387
Revenge!

38
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:13,879
That boy is stealing a sword!

39
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,391
Take the sword
- Thief!

40
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:29,051
Let him be

41
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:35,896
Why are you hurting a child?
- Who is he? He was stealing a sword

42
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:39,401
l'm no thief!
l am a very learned musician's son

43
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,238
Understand?
- And what've you learnt but stealing?

44
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:48,908
Why not? l have learnt all the Ragas

45
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,412
But why were you stealing a sword?
- l have to avenge my father's murder!

46
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:03,024
What an evil thing to say!
Against whom do you seek revenge?

47
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:09,022
A very big... prominent...

48
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:12,698
This boy is very dangerous!
He should be arrested

49
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:18,867
Just an innocent child, going wayward
because he's angry and unhappy

50
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,881
l'll bring him around
Come son

51
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:54,075
There's our village...
across the Yamuna

52
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,190
Mohan

53
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:37,548
Nice. lt takes a well-cultured voice
to deliver musical notes while talking

54
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,058
Who taught you singing, son?

55
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,056
l used to live in Gujarat
ln a village called Chapaner

56
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:54,230
My father was a bard.
He had mastery over music

57
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:58,739
He was taking me
to Haridas Swamy...

58
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:05,016
in Vrindavan for studying music. But...

59
00:14:05,217 --> 00:14:07,845
Haridas Swamy? Tansen's guru?

60
00:14:09,722 --> 00:14:11,019
Tansen!

61
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:16,762
Never mind, son

62
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,027
So what if your father is no more?
l will teach you music

63
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,439
Here comes Gauri

64
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,042
You always play your fiddle.

65
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:35,547
Where did you pick up a songster?

66
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,549
Songster...?

67
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:45,383
Whom was he calling out to?
- You answered his call

68
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:53,888
He answered yours. He heard your call
and he forgot he's mourning his father

69
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,667
Come

70
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:58,067
Come son

71
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:07,009
l won't let him miss his father.
What's his name?

72
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:09,010
Baijnath

73
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:16,185
l'll call him Baiju. Big-sounding names
are no good for village folks

74
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:24,026
What good will Baiju do?
- Baiju would help me row my boat

75
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,689
Master Baijnath wouldn't even
care to find out...

76
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,697
whether Gauri is tired of rowing

77
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,538
And it's going to be smooth sailing
for Gauri

78
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:48,053
Careful, my child

79
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,551
Greetings, Pundit. Back from Agra?

80
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,061
With this Tansen in tow!

81
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:06,661
No, no!

82
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:26,024
You don't know how to swim?

83
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:29,694
He knows only how to drown

84
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:37,195
ln the seas that is music,
there are many who will swim...

85
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:40,533
few are they who will dive deep.
You will see it for yourself, Mohan

86
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:44,706
Like Mian Tansen, this boy too will
become famous for his love of music

87
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,042
No! Not like Tansen!
- We'll even forget Tansen for you

88
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:58,192
On this hillock, here by
the banks of the Yamuna...

89
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:02,199
we built sand castles
when we were children

90
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:08,206
And here today in our youth,
dreams light up our lives

91
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,714
Never let the lights go out, Baiju

92
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,218
Which means that the light
is about to go out of your life

93
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:22,056
She's engaged to someone,
and she's marrying someomne else!

94
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:25,056
This is a matter of family honour!

95
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:28,395
This is no joke!
Something ought to be done!

96
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,069
Say it!
- What more have l to say?

97
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,463
She has said what
she was to have said!

98
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:41,069
Use this

99
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:44,742
Hurry up!

100
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:53,414
Can you make out a stick from a fiddle?
- Want me to tell you?

101
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:59,759
One plays music when plucked.
The other plays pluck on your head

102
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:05,695
The strings of fiddle win hearts over.
You can't beat Baiju with the stick

103
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,369
Nor can you win over Gauri.
- Forget it, Gauri

104
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,043
Look at this girl! Not ashamed a bit!

105
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:16,381
All day, she's with this boy!

106
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,894
Gauri, these days...

107
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:31,393
These days the cow is giving
very little milk

108
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:38,391
No wonder, she's going wayward

109
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:43,066
lsn't that so?
- No!

110
00:21:43,942 --> 00:21:48,743
No...?
- Oh all right

111
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:57,419
Gauri, you aren't a child anymore.
You're a grown-up now. Understand?

112
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,749
What's the big difference?

113
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:07,028
Mohan, you better keep
your girl on a leash

114
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,697
All day, she's wandering around
with Baiju

115
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:13,032
She's going to lead the other girls
in the village astray

116
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:17,368
Were the other girls to be like Gauri,
we'd kill them, wouldn't we?

117
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:22,042
But Mohan would also have to lose face

118
00:22:30,255 --> 00:22:32,723
Did you hear what the difference is?

119
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,226
And how did this shameless fellow
end up in our village?

120
00:22:43,435 --> 00:22:45,562
No one even knows his caste
or his family!

121
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:11,029
What are you lost in, son?

122
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:18,697
You've taken up the Veena
after long time. Let's hear

123
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:23,371
The strings are broken.
- You can have new strings

124
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,208
l've forgotten my melodies.
- Forgotten your melodies?

125
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:35,383
Then how on earth will you make
a famous musician?

126
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:37,889
By dint of your blessings,
l surely will

127
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:40,725
lt's this earth that's taking
my music away

128
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:56,574
Gauri, will you row me over too?

129
00:24:04,883 --> 00:24:08,512
Are you looking for something?
- Journey's end

130
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:13,021
There's a storm raging around us.
- And you've lost your way?

131
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:21,029
No! l want to get away from you.
My father will row you over

132
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:27,529
You're back to rowing after
so many days. Where have you been?

133
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,368
l had painted my hands with henna.
lf l rowed, the henna would wear off

134
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:38,705
Let me take a look
- l want to stay away from everyone!

135
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:48,393
For how long?

136
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:53,056
Till you've counted all the stars
in the skies for me

137
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:55,059
Stars?

138
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:02,339
Done.
- How? lt's daytime now

139
00:25:02,474 --> 00:25:07,002
For you. When you're cross with me,
it becomes as dark as the night

140
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,514
You make me see stars even in the day!

141
00:25:10,882 --> 00:25:14,181
l know all this.
Stop flattering me

142
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:17,844
Gauri, don't stay away from me.
You'll drive me mad!

143
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,858
They are right when they say
that like the Pundit...

144
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:27,021
you know nothing beyond music.
- Liars! l know everything

145
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,360
Like what?
- Outside music...

146
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:36,533
you are everything. Without you,
my song is only half-sung

147
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:39,877
You are my music, Gauri

148
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:46,882
Don't you talk these deep-meaning
things. l could drown!

149
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:54,381
You know how to swim.
Drowning is my lot

150
00:25:56,094 --> 00:25:58,722
A drowning man might take
a swimmer down with him

151
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:38,739
Pundit, everyone in the village
knows about Gauri and Baiju

152
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:48,418
Time was when he was
seething with vengeance.

153
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:52,490
Now he has turned around

154
00:30:54,292 --> 00:31:00,697
What has Baiju, that l haven't?
- Everything! Nose, ears, arms...

155
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:03,300
stomach, waist, everything.
Only fatter, so what?

156
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:10,204
Shut up! l lack only one thing.
l cannot sing!

157
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:17,876
And Gauri is going for a song!
- What an metaphor! Well said!

158
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,211
The hell with metaphors!
l'm losing her!

159
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,556
For Gauri's sake,
l must learn how to sing

160
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:37,728
My foe!
- Singing, you must learn

161
00:31:39,604 --> 00:31:41,071
Wait...

162
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:44,571
ln Delhi...? No, not Delhi

163
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:48,412
Not there...

164
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:51,078
not there either

165
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,412
Yes, now l remember!

166
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,578
l know of a maestro in Agra
who could teach you

167
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:04,019
Never mind... forget it.

168
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:07,022
Forget what?
- No, he won't teach you

169
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:10,033
Now are you going to tell me, or not?
- He isn't going to teach you

170
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:11,361
Not teach me... what?
- He won't

171
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:13,027
l got it. He won't teach me.
- Who...?

172
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:15,035
Shall l tell you who
you're talking about?

173
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:19,043
You mean Tansen?
- Who's Tansen?

174
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:24,040
l'm talking about another maestro.
What a master!

175
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:31,382
He sweeps over the bow

176
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:38,225
You moron! Will you mention a name?

177
00:32:39,497 --> 00:32:41,556
He hasn't a single name, so to say

178
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,400
His mother used to call him Lallu.
His father called him Ghasitu

179
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:49,398
The Emperor has given him
so many accolades

180
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:52,574
The Maestro of Maestros!
The Creator of Music!

181
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,071
The Master of the Sarangi!
Mian Huzoor Khan

182
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,181
Alias Ustad Ghasit Khan
(Ustad - Maestro)

183
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:07,355
Then l shall lay down all my wealth
at the feet of Ustad Ghasit Khan

184
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:13,020
Now go and get Ustad Ghasit Khan here

185
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:21,027
My lover waits on the hillock.
Here l am on the banks of the Yamuna

186
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,700
But l cannot go to see him
My feet are chained

187
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:31,709
Gauri, aren't you coming to the well?

188
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:37,213
You must! Today's the Spring Fest.

189
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:41,051
Poor thing, she doesn't
step out of the house these days

190
00:34:10,054 --> 00:34:12,022
He's calling you.
Why don't you go?

191
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:14,191
You go. He's calling you

192
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:26,763
lf l go to him, you'll kill me!
- She's dying, poor thing

193
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:29,706
How will she kill someone?
- Poor thing

194
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:34,871
l warn you!
- About what?

195
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:38,041
You're nuts!
Just you wait!

196
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:53,719
The jar is empty!
What's she churning?

197
00:34:55,266 --> 00:35:00,329
Her own heart
- Don't you tease me!

198
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:03,337
Don't you tease!

199
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:08,008
Are we teasing you?
lt's he who has been calling you

200
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,844
Wait

201
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,519
Go on

202
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,856
For my sake.
- Your sake? Get lost!

203
00:35:20,224 --> 00:35:24,354
lf she won't go, we'll bring
him here. Let's go

204
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,022
No!

205
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:13,486
Who are you looking for?

206
00:39:15,026 --> 00:39:16,994
Well...

207
00:39:24,368 --> 00:39:27,826
The poor fellow is looking
for something he has lost

208
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:34,172
Not here. He lost something on
the hillock on the banks of the Yamuna

209
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:35,605
And look where he comes looking!

210
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:39,516
Then you know what l've lost?

211
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:44,351
Basanti is hiding what you've lost.
- l'd tell, for a reward

212
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,015
Are you trying to skin me?

213
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,866
You want something?
- l just wanted to ask...

214
00:39:59,003 --> 00:39:59,697
My father isn't at home

215
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:12,709
Hello
My greetings

216
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:17,054
Where's the Ustad?

217
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,226
Can't you hear?
He's scoring music

218
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:33,561
A new Raga!
What Raga would this be?

219
00:40:34,705 --> 00:40:36,673
Yes, the Coughing Raga!

220
00:40:38,943 --> 00:40:46,008
But why behind closed doors?
- Singing here is forbidden

221
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,409
Only someone who sings better than
Mian Tansen can sing here

222
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,088
What if there be someone
who sings better than him?

223
00:40:58,129 --> 00:41:00,859
He will have to enter into contest
with Mian Tansen

224
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,363
But if...
- lf he wins...

225
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:07,192
Tansen will kill himself.
- What a strange law!

226
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:14,708
Who is this impudent fool?
- l am, Ustad

227
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,537
Moron! Do you know how deep
music can strike?

228
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:20,273
Deeper than the shoe bites!
Don't l know that!

229
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:25,720
Shut up, you rogue!
You've ruined my exercise

230
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:31,221
Now what do you want?
- My master is a rich man

231
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:36,230
He wants you to teach him music.
- To hell with your master!

232
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:39,069
Am l a singer sitting
in a marketplace?

233
00:41:39,437 --> 00:41:42,065
lf you're looking for a tutor,
move ahead

234
00:41:42,273 --> 00:41:44,241
Out there is Tansen's house

235
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:51,404
How am l concerned about Tansen?
l worship the Creator of Music!

236
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:56,580
He looks like a smart boy.
A connoisseur

237
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:06,358
Who knows not Ghasit Khan's melodies?
- You will be paid whatever you wish

238
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:10,690
Very well. l will come.
Arrange for two horses

239
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:18,038
ls your wife coming along too?
- You moron!

240
00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:23,708
l ride one horse,
and my Sarangi rides the other.

241
00:42:24,014 --> 00:42:26,983
That's my style

242
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:32,215
lf you disagree, then move ahead.
Tansen lives up the sreet

243
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:35,385
l'm no court singer living off
the Emperor

244
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:39,720
l'm a singer of erudition.
l will remain what l am

245
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,067
And l will remain what l am!

246
00:42:44,502 --> 00:42:47,733
Narpat, are you preparing
for the wedding?

247
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:50,733
Why not? l'm waiting for
Ustad Ghasit Khan

248
00:42:51,108 --> 00:42:53,076
No sooner than he arrives,
l'm going to get married

249
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:57,069
To the Ustad?
- Get lost!

250
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,408
Not the Ustad. Gauri

251
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:02,419
Once l've learnt how to sing

252
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:07,683
Now when is the Ustad coming?
- Next summer

253
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:11,692
Shut up! By next summer,
l'm going to be married

254
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:15,856
And while Ghasit Khan is teaching him
how to sing...

255
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:20,366
Gauri will be up there on the hillock
teaching Baiju new Ragas

256
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:22,639
What nonsense!

257
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:28,375
Gauri has stopped seeing Baiju.
- By day. Not in the nights

258
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,548
ln the nights?

259
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:40,719
Where is Gauri's father?
Mohan!

260
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:48,057
So...?
- What happened?

261
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:51,233
ls that so?
- What's is it?

262
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:53,402
What a shame!
- About what?

263
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:56,907
Every night, Gauri goes up the hillock
to meet Baiju

264
00:43:57,107 --> 00:43:58,734
Drown in shame!

265
00:43:58,943 --> 00:44:03,505
l'll break the bones of the man who
spreads canards about my daughter

266
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:05,849
And never mind who he might be!

267
00:44:11,722 --> 00:44:16,682
l'm calling in the village council
to decide about this!

268
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:26,528
Where the hell is she?

269
00:44:40,918 --> 00:44:42,044
Pundit...

270
00:44:46,924 --> 00:44:48,892
At this hour...?
- Where's Baiju?

271
00:44:50,094 --> 00:44:55,054
He should be on the hillock
by the river

272
00:44:56,934 --> 00:45:01,337
Come dusk, and he goes to
the hillock with his Veena

273
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:05,000
He returns only very late at night.

274
00:45:06,977 --> 00:45:10,003
He is so devoted to music

275
00:45:10,881 --> 00:45:15,341
Someday, he will challenge Tansen.
You will see

276
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:18,512
But Pundit...
- To tell you the truth...

277
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,019
more than me, it's Gauri who is
to be credited for his success

278
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:27,686
l am the teacher.
Gauri is his inspiration

279
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:34,360
Every day, she sits before him.
He composes for Gauri

280
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:39,365
And Gauri inspires him
to reach for the skies

281
00:45:42,246 --> 00:45:48,708
So what l am hearing is true?
- True, and beyond doubt

282
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:52,383
l have been there, and l have seen
for myself several times

283
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:54,049
You yourself?

284
00:45:55,259 --> 00:46:00,162
But who is to stop tongues from
wagging? How will l face the council?

285
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:07,163
l have to marry Gauri off as soon
as l can to Narpat

286
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:13,173
Gauri is married already.
To Baiju

287
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:15,679
To Baiju...?
- Yes

288
00:46:16,714 --> 00:46:21,344
Baiju is the composer.
Gauri is his music

289
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,020
Baiju is the singer.
Gauri is his song

290
00:46:29,226 --> 00:46:33,026
Baiju is the melody.
Gauri is his Veena

291
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:38,524
And where Gauri is his music,
Baiju is her crescendo

292
00:46:40,237 --> 00:46:43,695
The union of the two of them
is the doing...

293
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:49,040
of that artiste whose art
inspires pure, unbeguiled love

294
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:57,711
Consider this a marriage, Mohan.
No one can set them apart

295
00:47:03,694 --> 00:47:08,324
The council might.
l have given Narpat my word

296
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:12,661
lf you go back on your word,
you will have to pay a fine

297
00:47:14,872 --> 00:47:18,000
But if try to take the light away
from the lamp...

298
00:47:20,044 --> 00:47:24,344
the lamp will be extinguished,
and light will be no more

299
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,018
And there will be darkness
all around

300
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:41,688
l'll pay the fine, l will!
Gauri is the light of my life

301
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:44,434
And Baiju is the light
of Gauri's life

302
00:47:44,768 --> 00:47:48,704
No one will set them apart.
No one

303
00:48:00,184 --> 00:48:02,152
Where are you going
so late at night?

304
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:07,824
You...?
- Yes

305
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:12,996
Caught you!

306
00:48:14,364 --> 00:48:16,332
Have you lost something
on this hillock?

307
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:22,170
Your brains is what you've lost!
All for nothing you told my father...

308
00:48:22,372 --> 00:48:25,341
that l come to this hillock every night
to meet Baiju!

309
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:30,673
Now he's coming after me with a sword!
l'm running away from this village!

310
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:32,682
Listen...

311
00:48:33,217 --> 00:48:35,185
Wait Gauri, stop!

312
00:48:35,385 --> 00:48:40,687
What a fool l've been to be carried
away with what the villagers say

313
00:48:41,325 --> 00:48:45,395
Come Gauri, l'll reason
with your father

314
00:48:45,395 --> 00:48:48,023
No! He's going to kill you!

315
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:51,367
That must be him!

316
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:01,977
We've reached our village

317
00:49:02,346 --> 00:49:04,644
This is called ''The Gate to Agra''

318
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:07,479
Come
- Stop

319
00:49:10,354 --> 00:49:13,983
My master's house isn't far away.
- Set his house on fire!

320
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:18,655
Why?
- He's a cad and a knave!

321
00:49:19,363 --> 00:49:21,831
lmpudent ass!
- Whom are you all praise for?

322
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:28,661
Shut up! Your master should've waited
outside the village to welcome me

323
00:49:29,206 --> 00:49:32,733
And he should've bowed before me
l'm not a musician...

324
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:36,176
who goes to people's houses asking
for bows, like court musicians

325
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,010
l'm an erudite musician!
Understand?

326
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:46,353
My master mustn't have expected
the maestro to arrive at night

327
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:51,857
Fool, don't you know that
l was born at night?

328
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:56,362
And at night l shall die.
- Do not speak of dying Ustad!

329
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,868
You're still in the prime
of your youth

330
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:05,201
l'll inform my master in a trice,
while you water the horses

331
00:50:15,419 --> 00:50:17,387
Gauri, listen!

332
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:20,717
Listen to me, why are you
getting angry?

333
00:50:20,924 --> 00:50:23,051
But Narpat...
- Listen to me

334
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:27,054
lf your father comes by, tell him
that you're here to hear me sing

335
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:31,228
l'll take care of everything.
Now let me sing a song for you

336
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:41,907
Do you know what this Raga is?
''Sarkari Kanara''

337
00:50:54,791 --> 00:50:58,591
Damnation! Which fool is that,
singing out of tune?

338
00:50:59,463 --> 00:51:01,363
Who the hell is that?

339
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:12,207
Moron! Mules don't sing!
Drop that Tanpura!

340
00:51:12,476 --> 00:51:15,206
Don't be the murder of music!
- You old fool!

341
00:51:16,747 --> 00:51:21,047
l'm going to smash this Tanpura
on your head! Bloody ox!

342
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:25,376
Am l an ox?
- Am l a mule?

343
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:29,220
Undoubtedly! A complete ass...
bereft of any sense of music!

344
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,561
Uncouth! Get lost! Or l'm going
to hang you upside down!

345
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:40,729
Such impudence! What a pest!

346
00:51:51,948 --> 00:51:53,745
My father has said yes!

347
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,249
Father said yes!

348
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,187
Father said yes!

349
00:53:02,786 --> 00:53:06,347
Ya Allah! What have
l landed myself in?

350
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:37,050
2000 gold Ashrafie for our Chief.

351
00:53:38,088 --> 00:53:40,386
Else, we'll burn this village down

352
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:43,893
Only last year you looted us
of 2000 gold Ashrafie

353
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:46,396
We will come every year
to collect this tax

354
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,056
Tax? But we pay our taxes
to Raja Man Singh

355
00:53:50,434 --> 00:53:54,393
How can we pay taxes to both of you?
- Say what you want to our Chief

356
00:53:55,939 --> 00:54:00,069
The tax goes to ones who can collect.
Pay up 2000 gold Ashrafie

357
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,338
Else, at the sounding of this gun,
this village is going to be plundered

358
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:05,677
Have mercy on us!
Please reduce the amount

359
00:54:08,051 --> 00:54:10,019
Those who rob don't make deals

360
00:54:10,554 --> 00:54:12,522
Where are we to find so much?

361
00:58:06,022 --> 00:58:07,990
You will have to come with us

362
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:12,985
With you?
- Not a bad deal, singer

363
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:17,492
You've saved your village from carnage
for very little a price

364
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:23,336
What are you thinking?

365
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,343
You have won everything

366
00:58:31,448 --> 00:58:33,416
l have lost something

367
00:58:36,052 --> 00:58:38,350
Say, do you agree?

368
00:58:40,223 --> 00:58:41,349
Agreed

369
00:58:43,993 --> 00:58:45,756
No Baiju, no!

370
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:50,532
l won't let you go! Ever!

371
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:57,533
Plunder tha place!
We aren't staying here forever

372
00:58:57,741 --> 00:59:02,303
Stop! l'm coming with you.
- You can't!

373
00:59:02,612 --> 00:59:04,637
l have to, Gauri.
- Never!

374
00:59:06,683 --> 00:59:09,311
You won't, you won't go away Baiju!

375
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:15,323
Father, please tell her
l'll be back soon

376
00:59:18,862 --> 00:59:20,830
Let him go

377
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:23,833
Today, Baiju is saving
the whole village

378
00:59:26,202 --> 00:59:29,660
Father... !
- Do not worry, my child

379
00:59:30,774 --> 00:59:34,335
Baiju will certainly come back

380
00:59:35,979 --> 00:59:39,346
But l wasn't able to tell him
what l wanted to say

381
00:59:40,383 --> 00:59:44,342
Fortitude, Father. And give me
your blessings

382
00:59:56,466 --> 00:59:58,434
Baiju! Listen to me Baiju!

383
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:02,870
Gauri, l'll be back soon

384
01:00:20,256 --> 01:00:21,723
Sit

385
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:21,864
You didn't recognise my voice?

386
01:04:23,066 --> 01:04:25,193
l do not feel the need to

387
01:04:33,476 --> 01:04:36,707
For once, try to remember

388
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:41,539
What do you want?
- Only a song

389
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:47,054
Music that will reverberate
through the emptiness of my life

390
01:04:48,024 --> 01:04:52,393
ln my songs is a calm that will
contain the storms of life

391
01:04:59,268 --> 01:05:02,999
Leave that decision to me.
Only l know...

392
01:05:03,706 --> 01:05:06,504
the storms that lie hidden
in your music

393
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:12,178
lf my music be storm, build bastions
to withstand the storms

394
01:05:18,387 --> 01:05:23,017
Bastions stronger than a woman's heart
... have you ever known?

395
01:05:23,893 --> 01:05:27,021
The heart of a woman!
But what does it mean for you?

396
01:05:27,396 --> 01:05:31,696
lf at all, you are a fake!
A bandit, a plunderer

397
01:05:36,472 --> 01:05:42,707
Singer, is that what you see
in these eyes?

398
01:05:45,915 --> 01:05:49,373
Ones who plunder homes
cannot steal hearts

399
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:52,886
Bewitching eyes and a black heart!
Begone!

400
01:05:53,923 --> 01:05:57,381
For you, l have neither song
nor any treasure

401
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:10,995
Do not insult my love like this.
l am not a bandit

402
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:19,175
Loot and plunder isn't my calling.
Your village was once my father's fief

403
01:06:20,216 --> 01:06:25,347
Raja Man Singh took it from us
forcibly. He killed my father

404
01:06:26,389 --> 01:06:30,849
l was orphaned! l was in a rage.
l took to the sword

405
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:34,518
And ever since, l have sworn
to avenge my father

406
01:06:36,732 --> 01:06:38,029
Father...

407
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:42,027
Father!

408
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:47,702
lf ever time favours you...

409
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:54,210
you must take revenge against Tansen
for your father

410
01:06:54,584 --> 01:06:56,552
You must avenge!

411
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:03,983
Revenge!

412
01:07:13,202 --> 01:07:17,002
Singer, have l hurt you?

413
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,339
Tell me, tell me have l said
anything wrong?

414
01:07:21,877 --> 01:07:25,335
No, l had forgotten.
- What?

415
01:07:26,382 --> 01:07:28,350
l was supposed to have
avenged someone

416
01:07:28,651 --> 01:07:30,619
ln life, it's my prime duty

417
01:07:32,054 --> 01:07:35,353
Gauri's affections made me forget.
You have reminded me

418
01:07:35,992 --> 01:07:38,358
Gauri...?
- That girl back in my village

419
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:41,359
You sweet words haven't made me forget
her affections

420
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:45,200
But vengeance fires my emotions now!
- Vengeance?

421
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:47,027
Yes

422
01:07:47,236 --> 01:07:49,363
From Gauri, l picked up
the fragrance of love

423
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:51,697
From you, l have taken the
razor-sharp resolve

424
01:07:52,408 --> 01:07:54,376
lf Gauri is my flower,
you are my sword!

425
01:07:57,246 --> 01:08:00,306
Princess, you can give me nothing
but this sword

426
01:08:01,017 --> 01:08:05,977
ls that an excuse for
going back to Gauri?

427
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:10,819
lf l live, l surely will. But as
of now, l want to forget her love

428
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:13,325
My father's soul calls me!
Let me go!

429
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,828
Take me along. l might be
able to help you

430
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:19,001
No, l shall perfom my duty myself

431
01:08:34,216 --> 01:08:36,184
Stop him! He's leaving

432
01:08:37,987 --> 01:08:41,354
No, wait... let him go

433
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:46,018
The artiste can never be trapped

434
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:32,719
Who are you?
- l want your head

435
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:35,891
You are lying

436
01:12:36,926 --> 01:12:42,558
lf what you want could've come
by beheading me...

437
01:12:43,265 --> 01:12:48,066
you would've beheaded me.
Why did you destroy my instrument?

438
01:12:49,772 --> 01:12:51,740
What want of yours is fulfilled?

439
01:12:51,941 --> 01:12:54,569
The sound of your music
was draining my resolve

440
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,078
My sword-arm weakened

441
01:12:59,448 --> 01:13:01,848
You seem to appreciate music

442
01:13:02,217 --> 01:13:04,515
Music isn't only your fief, Tansen!

443
01:13:04,987 --> 01:13:11,688
Not my fief, but music
is surely my life

444
01:13:13,395 --> 01:13:19,698
Young man, no sword may end
Tansen's breath

445
01:13:21,403 --> 01:13:24,201
lf you have resolved
to slay Tansen,...

446
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:30,200
sing out the pathos in your soul

447
01:13:33,682 --> 01:13:36,708
For that, Tansen would die

448
01:13:44,093 --> 01:13:48,052
Who is this? A rebel? What do you
want done to him? Beheaded?

449
01:13:49,765 --> 01:13:53,223
ln this house, only hearts may bleed.

450
01:13:54,937 --> 01:13:58,236
And that too, for music's sake

451
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:02,837
How else is he to be punished?

452
01:14:09,318 --> 01:14:14,688
His punishment is to live
for years...

453
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:20,690
to suffer again and again
at the hands of life

454
01:14:22,731 --> 01:14:26,030
Escort him out

455
01:14:49,758 --> 01:14:51,726
Sing the pathos in your soul

456
01:14:56,265 --> 01:14:58,233
The pathos in my soul

457
01:14:59,034 --> 01:15:01,662
Where do l find it?
ln the mountain echoes?

458
01:15:02,771 --> 01:15:04,739
ln the gurgling streams?

459
01:15:07,443 --> 01:15:09,673
ln the dry desert sands?

460
01:15:11,213 --> 01:15:14,671
No, without a guru, this knowledge
l can never imbibe

461
01:15:15,718 --> 01:15:17,686
Only diamond can cut diamond

462
01:15:22,558 --> 01:15:26,688
The diamond that was polished
at the hands of Haridas Swami

463
01:15:32,067 --> 01:15:33,534
Vrindavan

464
01:15:42,478 --> 01:15:47,211
They say that God's world...

465
01:15:47,316 --> 01:15:49,716
is full of music

466
01:15:51,253 --> 01:15:56,054
From all things God created,
l have tried to seek music

467
01:15:59,261 --> 01:16:01,161
And now, l come to you

468
01:16:02,865 --> 01:16:05,663
For without the Guru,
there is no knowledge

469
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:13,998
And without knowledge man's quest
is not fulfilled

470
01:16:14,376 --> 01:16:16,344
What do you wish, son?

471
01:16:19,548 --> 01:16:23,348
l wish to imbibe the entire knowledge
of music, for revenge

472
01:16:24,219 --> 01:16:26,187
Music for revenge?

473
01:16:28,223 --> 01:16:30,191
You are mistaken, son

474
01:16:31,059 --> 01:16:37,362
Music relates heart to heart.
Music elevates the soul

475
01:16:38,734 --> 01:16:45,697
Music turns enmity into love
Music doesn't extoll revenge

476
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:49,375
No! l want revenge. l must!
And through music

477
01:16:50,679 --> 01:16:53,705
So long as you nurse the feeling
of vengeance in your heart...

478
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:57,385
you can never learn music.
To learn music...

479
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:03,984
fill your heart with love.

480
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:08,159
lnstead of hurting others...

481
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:14,500
fill your heart with pathos.
- Love and pathos l have forgotten

482
01:17:15,971 --> 01:17:20,670
lf you refuse to teach me,
l shall die at your doorstep

483
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:27,676
Son, fire cannot quench fire.
Water quenches fire

484
01:17:28,984 --> 01:17:33,011
Darkness is not dispelled by darkness.
Light dispels

485
01:17:33,889 --> 01:17:38,349
Hatred cannot end hatred.
Love does it

486
01:17:46,735 --> 01:17:49,033
l give you the symbol of my love

487
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:53,871
Play this Veena

488
01:17:55,077 --> 01:17:59,537
When the string strike a chord
inside your heart...

489
01:18:00,415 --> 01:18:04,317
when you find peace of mind,
come to me

490
01:18:06,188 --> 01:18:09,988
Whatever l know, l shall teach you

491
01:19:43,218 --> 01:19:45,345
Blessed be the name of The Lord

492
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:30,562
Lord, l hear of the three reasonances
of Aum upon which rests all of Creation

493
01:20:32,834 --> 01:20:36,565
Aum is the primal sound.
The first to be

494
01:20:38,106 --> 01:20:40,574
Of these three, have come to be
the seven notes

495
01:20:42,611 --> 01:20:44,579
ln these seven notes l wish
to immerse myself

496
01:20:45,781 --> 01:20:49,410
But in the fires in my heart
all seas are dried up

497
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:55,749
Of life, l have received nothing.
My guru has rejected me

498
01:20:58,794 --> 01:21:00,694
Now l come unto Thee

499
01:21:02,898 --> 01:21:06,356
Here, l sit before Thee

500
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:12,197
To stir Your heart of stone

501
01:21:13,075 --> 01:21:15,043
Or l shall be silenced forever

502
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:23,374
But even after l have died,
my ashes will await resurrection

503
01:21:24,419 --> 01:21:27,388
That day too, l shall tell You
the same, Lord

504
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:30,224
Give me music!

505
01:21:30,759 --> 01:21:32,727
Give me music, give me music!

506
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:23,704
''You and l, we shall consummate
our love''

507
01:22:26,348 --> 01:22:30,216
Whither consummation?
Baiju, where are you?

508
01:22:33,488 --> 01:22:40,052
Here it was that you sang
that immortal song of love

509
01:22:45,033 --> 01:22:49,060
lt was here you swore,
here you made your promises

510
01:22:49,938 --> 01:22:51,906
Have you forgotten?

511
01:23:20,402 --> 01:23:22,370
''Do not lose heart, son''

512
01:23:22,904 --> 01:23:27,364
l am far away from you.
But my soul is with you

513
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,708
Rise and sing

514
01:23:31,913 --> 01:23:33,540
Sing the Lalit

515
01:23:34,416 --> 01:23:39,877
lmagine the fair maiden bedecked
in flowers, with a smile on her face

516
01:23:41,089 --> 01:23:46,721
Her eyes, like lotus petals,
sing the Lalit

517
01:24:11,386 --> 01:24:13,183
This is the Gaur Malhar

518
01:24:13,455 --> 01:24:17,357
Sung to the accompaniment of
the melodious Sarangi of Gaur

519
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:22,519
Sing along with the pattering
of the rain, The Gaur Malhar

520
01:24:47,756 --> 01:24:49,553
This is the Puriya

521
01:24:49,758 --> 01:24:52,226
Resplendent in regal finery,
the bejewelled crown, the halo...

522
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:57,229
he carries his weapons.
ln praise of benevolent Kings...

523
01:24:57,766 --> 01:24:59,734
the Puriya is sung

524
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,527
This, the Bageshri...

525
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:34,533
sung to the praise of
the conquest of knowledge

526
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:39,702
Sing the Bageshri to invoke
the Goddess of Knowledge

527
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:20,010
Father!

528
01:26:23,051 --> 01:26:25,019
This is sin!

529
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,957
ls it sin?

530
01:26:31,393 --> 01:26:38,026
My child, what your thirsting eyes
seek everywhere...

531
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:41,864
you cannot bring yourself to speak.

532
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,707
l've already grown old looking for him

533
01:26:49,244 --> 01:26:51,212
For me too, this is a dream

534
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:56,710
What words have l to give you hope?

535
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:09,322
Mohan...
- l have heard enough

536
01:27:13,201 --> 01:27:15,499
l hear Narpat had convened
the village council yesterday

537
01:27:15,637 --> 01:27:17,662
Yes.
- What was decided?

538
01:27:18,373 --> 01:27:20,341
The council expressed gratitude
to Baiju

539
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:25,668
But they also said that a daughter
cannot be given away as a reward

540
01:27:26,314 --> 01:27:28,339
Her engagement to Narpat
cannot be annulled

541
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:33,342
Not even if you pay a fine?
- What do l get out of paying a fine?

542
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:38,188
Where is Baiju? People were giving
my daughter a bad name all for him!

543
01:27:38,893 --> 01:27:41,691
So what if l annul the engagement
to Narpat? lf Baiju doesn't turn up...

544
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:44,198
who else will marry her?

545
01:27:44,732 --> 01:27:49,692
lf l die before my daughter
is married off, l will go to hell!

546
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,868
She gives herself a bad name,
and now she weeps!

547
01:28:05,687 --> 01:28:10,989
Tell me, do l console her, or
do l stop people from talking?

548
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:15,154
lf l care for her emotions,
l will fail in my duty as a father

549
01:28:16,297 --> 01:28:18,265
Have patience, Mohan

550
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,498
There is so much that
man wishes to do

551
01:28:22,871 --> 01:28:24,839
But what happens,
is what God wills

552
01:28:25,874 --> 01:28:27,842
Come in

553
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:47,725
Baiju, you did not return

554
01:32:49,771 --> 01:32:54,572
And everyone else here
has decided my fate

555
01:32:57,044 --> 01:33:02,243
But l shall refute this decision

556
01:33:06,788 --> 01:33:10,747
lt was here,...

557
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,928
that l drank
the elixir of love

558
01:33:18,533 --> 01:33:20,091
And today...

559
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:23,937
it is poison that
l am being made to drink

560
01:33:49,764 --> 01:33:50,731
You!

561
01:33:51,032 --> 01:33:52,397
You're the one who took
my Baiju away!

562
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,401
Tell me, where is my Baiju?
Has he come with you?

563
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:59,398
No. He went away long ago.

564
01:33:59,607 --> 01:34:01,734
Where to?
- Some say...

565
01:34:02,443 --> 01:34:07,574
he went towards Agra. Others say,
a madman called Baiju...

566
01:34:07,682 --> 01:34:11,584
roams the forests of Vrindavan.
Some say that...

567
01:34:12,787 --> 01:34:16,245
he has become a disciple of
Haridas Swamy, and lives with him

568
01:34:18,793 --> 01:34:21,421
l was on my way to look for him there
when l heard that...

569
01:34:21,729 --> 01:34:23,754
the council has decreed
that you be married off

570
01:34:26,534 --> 01:34:31,699
Baiju spurned my love.
l have come to pay him back

571
01:34:32,673 --> 01:34:35,198
Are you ridiculing my love?

572
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:38,708
No, l have come to help you

573
01:34:41,249 --> 01:34:45,379
l had driven out one of a pair
of lovebirds in Eden

574
01:34:47,088 --> 01:34:49,056
lf l let this Eden wither away...

575
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,720
the lovebird will have nowhere to
return to

576
01:34:54,095 --> 01:34:58,395
For your Baiju's sake, you will have
to live. l've come to take you to him

577
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,068
Come with me

578
01:35:03,271 --> 01:35:06,570
But...
- Do you not want to go to Baiju?

579
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:13,402
Then, have faith in me.
Come away with me, quietly

580
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:16,416
Come with me, sister

581
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:37,030
No reason for worry, Swami.
Use this salve

582
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:39,706
And walk a while every day

583
01:35:41,075 --> 01:35:45,535
Apothecary, when l step down
from the bed,...''

584
01:35:46,914 --> 01:35:48,882
my legs collapse

585
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:52,048
And you ask me to walk?

586
01:35:54,689 --> 01:36:00,389
Without worship to the Lord,
l cannot have any peace.

587
01:36:03,764 --> 01:36:08,224
My soul thirsts for The Lord

588
01:40:54,054 --> 01:40:55,681
Lord!

589
01:41:00,894 --> 01:41:05,524
l beg for your grace

590
01:41:09,737 --> 01:41:11,705
l have scaled the heights of music

591
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:14,708
But there is darkness ahead

592
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:16,876
Show me light, Guru

593
01:41:18,679 --> 01:41:22,376
ln your music,...

594
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:29,045
l have seen my God

595
01:41:30,524 --> 01:41:33,152
By the grace of Lord Krishna...

596
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:39,321
your name, your music
will be made immortal

597
01:41:44,705 --> 01:41:50,007
The years of schooling...

598
01:41:52,212 --> 01:41:54,009
is now bearing fruit

599
01:41:54,114 --> 01:41:57,015
lt is all by dint
of your blessings

600
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:04,521
No. The one l thought was lost,...

601
01:42:07,061 --> 01:42:09,029
now shines as brilliant as a diamond

602
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:17,201
l have only brushed,...

603
01:42:18,405 --> 01:42:21,374
burnished and tempered it

604
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:28,712
But the talent that was hidden within
is God's own gift

605
01:42:38,025 --> 01:42:41,552
Son, l'll be back

606
01:42:42,496 --> 01:42:45,556
Till then, practice the Todi
to perfection

607
01:42:45,933 --> 01:42:47,059
l will

608
01:42:58,512 --> 01:42:59,479
Now!

609
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:05,581
Now is the time come.
Father, l will avenge you

610
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:13,753
You haven't gotten over vengeance yet?

611
01:43:15,529 --> 01:43:20,762
Son, leave vengeance to The Lord

612
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:25,270
Forget all that, and put in your best

613
01:44:36,076 --> 01:44:41,378
Now is the time come.
Father, l will avenge you

614
01:45:04,705 --> 01:45:07,572
God! Cast my heart in stone
... in stone, like yours!

615
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:09,909
Turn me to stone!

616
01:46:14,942 --> 01:46:19,242
Of music, You have forged the world!

617
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:24,077
Does my music bear nothing
upon Your heart?

618
01:46:25,519 --> 01:46:28,079
Loveless music has no bearing

619
01:46:31,224 --> 01:46:33,692
lt is with love that man
reaches out to God

620
01:46:35,062 --> 01:46:38,862
And love... love lies at your feet!

621
01:46:47,341 --> 01:46:49,309
Do not spurn love!

622
01:46:50,477 --> 01:46:54,709
Love is God!

623
01:46:56,483 --> 01:46:58,451
Do not leave me!

624
01:46:59,753 --> 01:47:00,720
No!

625
01:47:02,089 --> 01:47:05,718
God! What am l to do?!
Show me the way!

626
01:47:14,935 --> 01:47:15,902
God!

627
01:47:18,605 --> 01:47:19,594
God!

628
01:47:26,113 --> 01:47:27,910
Gauri! Go away!

629
01:47:31,218 --> 01:47:33,186
Go away Gauri!
- Where will l go?

630
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:38,680
No one but you can embrace me!
And l will have my recognition...

631
01:47:39,226 --> 01:47:42,855
only when you make me your wife

632
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:46,028
For me, marrying you now,
would be making a widow of you!

633
01:47:47,467 --> 01:47:50,698
lf l lose against the one
l seek vengeance...

634
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:52,862
l will be beheaded

635
01:47:54,074 --> 01:47:56,042
Vengeance? Against whom?

636
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:57,977
Tansen

637
01:47:59,913 --> 01:48:02,040
Tansen? How come...?

638
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:04,884
By defeating him in
a contest of music

639
01:48:05,686 --> 01:48:08,052
l can marry you only after
l have defeated Tansen

640
01:48:09,923 --> 01:48:13,381
The power to defeat
as great a musician as Tansen...

641
01:48:14,695 --> 01:48:19,723
do you have it in you, Baiju?
- l'd rather die...

642
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:22,063
than dishonour the promise
l made my father

643
01:48:24,438 --> 01:48:29,068
lf l live, l will come directly
to you

644
01:48:30,043 --> 01:48:31,670
But till then, consider me dead

645
01:48:31,778 --> 01:48:35,339
No! l've been through so much
to find you!

646
01:48:35,716 --> 01:48:38,685
l'm not going to let you go!
Come back with me!

647
01:48:39,386 --> 01:48:43,186
Have you forgotten the hilllock
by the banks of the Yamuna?

648
01:48:44,224 --> 01:48:48,024
lt was there that l foreswore
the promise l made to my father

649
01:48:48,729 --> 01:48:50,697
Go away Gauri, go away!

650
01:48:51,898 --> 01:48:53,866
lf l leave you, where am l to go?

651
01:48:54,067 --> 01:48:57,696
l have burnt all my bridges.
You are the only one l have!

652
01:48:58,472 --> 01:49:02,533
Take me with you, Baiju.
Let's sink together, if we must

653
01:49:03,243 --> 01:49:07,043
No, with you around, l will forget
my mission in life

654
01:49:07,748 --> 01:49:09,875
You have disrupted my schooling

655
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:14,380
You and your love will be my undoing!
l will never be able to defeat Tansen!

656
01:49:51,591 --> 01:49:53,559
Blessed be the name of The Lord

657
01:50:02,903 --> 01:50:06,703
Guru! l'm going mad!

658
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:11,874
This is why l have come to give you
one last advice

659
01:50:12,746 --> 01:50:16,876
Forsake hatred. Let love blossom
in your heart

660
01:50:17,684 --> 01:50:20,710
Without love, your heart
will be bereft of pathos

661
01:50:21,087 --> 01:50:26,389
Without pathos, your music will not
be able to melt stone

662
01:50:27,093 --> 01:50:32,497
And pathos you will have,
once you have been hurt

663
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:44,837
Hurt...?

664
01:50:48,381 --> 01:50:50,349
Why do l not die?

665
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,326
Hurt...

666
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:47,406
Love

667
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:55,848
Gauri!

668
01:52:19,406 --> 01:52:22,034
What happened to you, Gauri?

669
01:52:32,018 --> 01:52:34,043
How did this happen, Gauri?

670
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:43,395
l have removed myself from your path

671
01:52:44,097 --> 01:52:46,065
Why have you done this?

672
01:52:46,933 --> 01:52:52,735
Now nothing lies between
you and your music

673
01:52:56,509 --> 01:52:58,067
Now, you....

674
01:52:59,446 --> 01:53:01,414
you will be able to defeat Tansen

675
01:53:02,382 --> 01:53:05,579
No! l'm not going to let you die!
l won't let you die!

676
01:53:28,808 --> 01:53:30,708
She sleeps

677
01:53:33,246 --> 01:53:35,214
She will not talk to you

678
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:38,710
She will talk to no one

679
01:53:41,087 --> 01:53:44,215
She will only talk to me

680
01:53:59,105 --> 01:54:01,232
What happened to Gauri?
- Snake!

681
01:54:01,508 --> 01:54:03,237
Get out of here! Run!

682
01:54:15,288 --> 01:54:17,085
Looks like she has been bitten
by a snake

683
01:54:17,223 --> 01:54:18,747
Snake?

684
01:54:22,128 --> 01:54:24,096
l remember!

685
01:54:24,798 --> 01:54:29,861
lt was this snake!
The snake that bit Gauri!

686
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,701
You are the witch who set us apart!
Have you come to set us apart again?

687
01:54:33,907 --> 01:54:38,207
No Baiju, l brought Gauri here.
- No! You brought her ashes here!

688
01:54:38,912 --> 01:54:42,712
What do l do with ashes?
l must go and find Gauri!

689
01:54:44,918 --> 01:54:47,716
Baiju! Come to your senses!
Where are you going?

690
01:54:48,021 --> 01:54:50,216
Leave me alone! With Gauri,
l've died too

691
01:54:50,356 --> 01:54:53,052
But Baiju...
- Aren't you sated yet?

692
01:54:53,426 --> 01:54:56,554
Go on, put the corpse to fire!
And revel in the fires!

693
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:58,898
Dance, dance!

694
01:55:09,509 --> 01:55:12,740
The mind takes the toll in a battle
between the mind and the heart

695
01:55:14,514 --> 01:55:17,244
Baiju has gone mad!
Baiju is insane!

696
01:55:23,523 --> 01:55:27,084
Laugh! You laugh too
while l weep!

697
01:55:42,408 --> 01:55:44,535
This brooks no delay.
We must hurry

698
01:55:44,911 --> 01:55:46,708
But Baiju...?
- This is no time to talk to him

699
01:55:46,913 --> 01:55:48,881
We'll come back for him later

700
01:59:42,715 --> 01:59:44,842
He's here! My disciple is here!

701
01:59:48,321 --> 01:59:49,345
Some lunatic

702
01:59:49,889 --> 01:59:53,689
Looks like a madman
- Do you not know the law here?

703
01:59:54,227 --> 01:59:55,421
Somebody stop him!

704
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:58,527
Sing on!

705
02:01:04,730 --> 02:01:05,697
Stop singing!

706
02:01:06,566 --> 02:01:07,533
Who is this?

707
02:01:08,901 --> 02:01:09,868
Do you care for your life?

708
02:01:23,583 --> 02:01:25,710
Don't you know?
Singing is forbidden here!

709
02:01:27,253 --> 02:01:31,155
l do not know.
l know nothing

710
02:01:33,192 --> 02:01:35,160
Nor am l singing

711
02:01:38,865 --> 02:01:43,325
lt's someone else within me
... who is singing...

712
02:01:46,038 --> 02:01:48,006
and l have no hold
over him

713
02:01:50,042 --> 02:01:52,670
lf you can, stop him

714
02:01:55,381 --> 02:01:58,009
But...
let him sing on

715
02:01:59,385 --> 02:02:01,512
We need his pathos

716
02:02:03,222 --> 02:02:05,190
Let the hearts be overcome.

717
02:02:05,658 --> 02:02:10,027
Let us weep too... and let
the skies, the earth, weep too

718
02:02:10,997 --> 02:02:16,526
Wonderful! Sing on!
Face the palace and sing!

719
02:02:17,470 --> 02:02:22,533
l tell you, your voice sings a note
deeper by the thousandths than earlier

720
02:02:24,911 --> 02:02:30,713
What are you staring at?
My disciple! And no joke!

721
02:02:32,585 --> 02:02:34,052
Disciple... yours?

722
02:02:34,253 --> 02:02:38,053
And haven't you told him that
the one who sings here...

723
02:02:38,424 --> 02:02:42,884
must better the royal bard,
Mian Tansen? Else...

724
02:02:43,029 --> 02:02:46,726
he is punished!
- Then let him face this challenge!

725
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:51,903
The wheat will be separated
from the chaff!

726
02:02:52,104 --> 02:02:54,072
ls that so?
Arrest him!

727
02:02:59,612 --> 02:03:02,080
Why are you holding me?
He's the one who's singing

728
02:03:05,284 --> 02:03:10,085
The Emperor has decided.
Do you hear?

729
02:03:12,458 --> 02:03:17,919
Unless you contest within a week,
both of us will be hanged!

730
02:03:18,965 --> 02:03:22,765
We're going to be dead!

731
02:03:38,484 --> 02:03:41,885
What have l landed myself in?

732
02:03:43,422 --> 02:03:45,390
This madman doesn't even answer!

733
02:03:46,692 --> 02:03:51,220
How do l answer, Gauri?
They won't let me sing

734
02:03:51,931 --> 02:03:56,231
They haven't forbidden you.
Thay are telling you to sing

735
02:03:57,269 --> 02:04:00,238
You must sing before Emperor Akbar

736
02:04:01,774 --> 02:04:05,232
No, l will sing before no one.

737
02:04:07,947 --> 02:04:11,075
l will only sing to Gauri

738
02:04:14,687 --> 02:04:18,748
l'm no Gauri! l'm Ghasit Khan!
Don't you see my beard?!

739
02:04:22,128 --> 02:04:24,756
Are you a wizard?
- Wizard...?

740
02:04:26,132 --> 02:04:30,535
Turn me into a firefly!
l want to burn in the fire!

741
02:04:33,239 --> 02:04:36,868
Lord! There's no escape now!

742
02:04:39,912 --> 02:04:41,880
Gauri is gone!

743
02:04:53,025 --> 02:04:54,993
What noise is that?

744
02:04:56,429 --> 02:05:01,059
ls someone being executed?

745
02:05:21,454 --> 02:05:23,081
Lord!

746
02:05:41,674 --> 02:05:44,370
Come on! l'm here to help you escape!

747
02:05:46,011 --> 02:05:50,539
You're the bandit!
You've come back for him?

748
02:05:50,683 --> 02:05:52,048
Silent!

749
02:05:52,251 --> 02:05:54,378
Else, you too will be silenced
like the guards

750
02:05:56,822 --> 02:05:59,723
My men are waiting outside
for us

751
02:06:02,094 --> 02:06:04,221
What has come over you?

752
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:06,898
We cannot be here for long!

753
02:06:07,266 --> 02:06:10,565
Come with me!
- No

754
02:06:11,937 --> 02:06:16,237
Once you had said that, earlier.
''Come with me''

755
02:06:17,443 --> 02:06:20,412
Don't go Baiju. She's fooling you

756
02:06:22,948 --> 02:06:25,246
l have come to take you to Gauri

757
02:06:25,518 --> 02:06:29,511
You are a liar! Gauri is waiting
across the river for me

758
02:06:31,223 --> 02:06:36,354
Will you take me across?
- Not across

759
02:06:36,896 --> 02:06:39,524
Here! Gauri is alive

760
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:46,702
We took Gauri to an apothecary
who knows about venoms. She...

761
02:06:47,072 --> 02:06:50,701
You are telling a lie, a ruthless lie
just to take me out of here

762
02:06:50,910 --> 02:06:52,878
No Birju! l'm telling the truth!

763
02:06:53,746 --> 02:06:56,874
l went back to that temple in ruins
to tell you. But l didn 't find you

764
02:06:57,416 --> 02:07:02,376
lt's true that Gauri lives.
But she keeps saying that...

765
02:07:02,922 --> 02:07:08,224
''For Baiju, l'm dead.
Don't tell Baiju that l'm alive''

766
02:07:08,828 --> 02:07:10,796
''Else, my sacrifice
will have gone waste''

767
02:07:12,698 --> 02:07:18,227
''He wants to defeat Tansen.
And for him, l am a hindrance''

768
02:07:19,371 --> 02:07:25,071
Yes! Gauri is alive!
She is alive!

769
02:07:26,779 --> 02:07:30,010
She has gone back to her village.
- And you want me to escape...

770
02:07:30,216 --> 02:07:32,946
so that l can go back to her?
- lt should not have been so

771
02:07:34,053 --> 02:07:39,514
But this is what the heart says...
the heart you once called a stone

772
02:07:41,994 --> 02:07:43,962
Someone is coming!
Come on!

773
02:07:53,072 --> 02:07:55,370
This is the bandit queen!
Arrest her!

774
02:08:07,086 --> 02:08:11,045
Move
Roopmati

775
02:08:11,924 --> 02:08:15,724
She has been wanted for ages.
Got her now

776
02:08:18,664 --> 02:08:22,065
Where are you off to Ustad?
- With you. Home

777
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:24,795
Your home is here, Ustad.
- Let me go!

778
02:08:24,937 --> 02:08:27,735
- Out of my way!
Let me go!

779
02:08:28,274 --> 02:08:32,176
Let me go! Gauri is alive!

780
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:35,339
Baiju! Baiju! Baiju!
Where did he come from?

781
02:08:35,547 --> 02:08:38,015
He brings my daughter to disgrace,
and he brings me to dishonour!

782
02:08:38,217 --> 02:08:40,685
Come the time to marry her,
he absconds!

783
02:08:40,886 --> 02:08:42,353
Scoundrel! Rogue!
- Father!

784
02:08:42,554 --> 02:08:47,355
Silent! Aren't you ashamed?
All this is your doing!

785
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:50,688
Without a thought, you did
what you wanted to!

786
02:08:51,463 --> 02:08:57,197
Had l not used ruse, people would say
that Mohan sent his daughter away...

787
02:08:57,303 --> 02:09:00,033
because the council gave it's ruling.
Even at my age...

788
02:09:00,139 --> 02:09:05,202
you haven't a care for my honour!
- That's why l've come back

789
02:09:05,344 --> 02:09:07,312
l'd rather you were dead!

790
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:11,379
What do l do? Even Death
has deserted me

791
02:09:12,918 --> 02:09:15,386
Kill me! With your own hands!

792
02:09:16,588 --> 02:09:21,048
l'm going to kill myself
if you refuse to marry Narpat

793
02:09:23,696 --> 02:09:25,664
But...
- What...?!

794
02:09:26,098 --> 02:09:32,162
Will you still wait for the madman?
Everyone looked for him

795
02:09:33,038 --> 02:09:35,165
Even you went looking for him.
Did you find him?

796
02:09:41,714 --> 02:09:45,343
Then forget him. Your wedding has been
fixed for the next full moon

797
02:09:46,385 --> 02:09:51,015
You have only two options.
Marry Narpat, or kill your father

798
02:09:51,991 --> 02:09:53,959
This is my final decision

799
02:10:03,068 --> 02:10:06,697
Open the door.
- The doors of luck don't open...

800
02:10:06,805 --> 02:10:12,869
time and again. When she was trying
to get you out, you were meditating!

801
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:20,712
You can see Gauri only
if you sing against Tansen

802
02:10:34,199 --> 02:10:38,158
l must sing!

803
02:10:40,205 --> 02:10:42,002
God!

804
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:47,175
Give me music! That l may fulfill
the promise l made to my father...

805
02:10:49,048 --> 02:10:51,016
that l may have my Gauri

806
02:10:51,450 --> 02:10:53,509
l will sing!

807
02:11:41,867 --> 02:11:44,335
This contest has not ended

808
02:11:47,706 --> 02:11:54,339
Tansen, the Emperor ordered you
to sing the Todi to attract the deer

809
02:11:56,215 --> 02:11:59,673
Young man, you have done the same

810
02:12:00,552 --> 02:12:05,353
But you have not shown
anything charismatic...

811
02:12:06,058 --> 02:12:09,687
to prove yourself a better
musician than Tansen

812
02:12:12,464 --> 02:12:18,369
My Lord, if l may speak without fear,
l wish to say something

813
02:12:18,737 --> 02:12:19,863
You may speak

814
02:12:20,072 --> 02:12:26,033
My disciple looks like a madman.
But in his music...

815
02:12:26,145 --> 02:12:29,376
lies the power to melt stone!

816
02:12:30,582 --> 02:12:37,044
l ask for my disciple and Mian Tansen
are to sing the same Raga

817
02:12:39,658 --> 02:12:45,062
ln that crystal bowl filled with water
is kept a block of marble

818
02:12:47,266 --> 02:12:53,227
The Emperor waits. Prove it that...

819
02:12:54,373 --> 02:12:57,240
stories of stone melting to music...

820
02:12:58,443 --> 02:13:04,075
is not mere folklore. Show us
that it can be true

821
02:13:06,118 --> 02:13:08,086
The contest may begin

822
02:18:29,875 --> 02:18:33,333
Bravo my son!
You have honoured your Guru!

823
02:18:33,712 --> 02:18:35,680
My The Lord preserve you!

824
02:18:35,981 --> 02:18:38,176
Non pareil!
A miracle!

825
02:18:56,334 --> 02:19:02,034
The Emperor has a doubt. The crystal
did not shatter. lt was shattered

826
02:19:03,575 --> 02:19:05,042
Sing again

827
02:19:05,477 --> 02:19:10,540
Lord, l cannot lie to absolve myself
of defeat

828
02:19:12,083 --> 02:19:16,884
Music has found a new exponent,
not an adversary

829
02:19:20,759 --> 02:19:25,719
Baijnath, The Emperor recognises
your victory

830
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:35,005
Tansen, l regret your loss deeply

831
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:40,341
ln Tansen's loss lies music's victory!

832
02:19:41,379 --> 02:19:44,177
The Emperor, Tansen...

833
02:19:44,983 --> 02:19:49,852
and all of Hindustan must rejoice!
For here has been unearthed....

834
02:19:50,722 --> 02:19:54,021
a most precious
diamond that will...

835
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:59,019
dazzle the annals of music

836
02:19:59,230 --> 02:20:06,193
lndeed. This sparkle of this diamond
does proud the court of Emperor Akbar

837
02:20:11,076 --> 02:20:17,208
The Emperor is pleased with
your performance. Seek what you will

838
02:20:18,016 --> 02:20:21,543
lf The Emperor so grants,
l shall ask for only three gifts

839
02:20:22,253 --> 02:20:23,720
You may

840
02:20:23,922 --> 02:20:27,221
First, the freeing of music
from the confines of law

841
02:20:28,593 --> 02:20:32,654
Second, Roopmati's release
and repatriation of her fiefs

842
02:20:34,199 --> 02:20:38,329
And third, the very life of music

843
02:20:38,970 --> 02:20:42,337
The very life of music...?
l do not understand

844
02:20:42,807 --> 02:20:46,004
The very life of music is Tansen

845
02:20:47,379 --> 02:20:51,679
Lord, grant Tansen life,
and save music from death!

846
02:20:53,551 --> 02:20:57,351
You have the soft heart
of an artiste, Baijnath

847
02:20:59,391 --> 02:21:03,350
But the law is heartless

848
02:21:04,229 --> 02:21:07,357
Akbar's laws are humane,
Your Majesty

849
02:21:08,066 --> 02:21:10,034
l beseech You
in the name of kindness

850
02:21:14,072 --> 02:21:18,702
l am leaning towards
your principles, young singer

851
02:21:23,915 --> 02:21:28,375
The one who showed me music
in a new light...

852
02:21:29,421 --> 02:21:32,652
the one who gave me a new life
... the one who has lit...

853
02:21:32,757 --> 02:21:37,319
a million lamps... how can
l bear to see him dead?

854
02:21:38,363 --> 02:21:40,661
You are truly an exponent
of art, Baijnath

855
02:21:42,200 --> 02:21:46,000
The Emperor cannot but appreciate
your commitment to art

856
02:21:47,639 --> 02:21:51,006
Your performance today,
and your lofty ideals...

857
02:21:52,043 --> 02:21:56,343
forces an Emperor to allow humane
consideration...

858
02:21:58,049 --> 02:22:03,851
to assume primacy over the law.
Your petitions are granted

859
02:22:03,988 --> 02:22:05,956
Long live Baijnath!

860
02:22:54,272 --> 02:22:55,739
Baiju!

861
02:23:00,111 --> 02:23:03,569
Baiju's voice!
Do you hear?

862
02:23:04,115 --> 02:23:06,083
My Baiju is back!

863
02:23:11,289 --> 02:23:15,089
Baiju! You're back!
- Yes, l'm back''

864
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:20,420
Gauri is getting married today.
- Gauri... getting married?

865
02:23:21,966 --> 02:23:23,934
Gauri's wedding?
- Yes son

866
02:23:25,136 --> 02:23:29,539
Row me across!
- l cannot!

867
02:23:30,008 --> 02:23:33,535
The river is in flood! How can l cross?
My boat will sink

868
02:23:33,912 --> 02:23:38,042
All my hopes are sinking!
l have to go! l must!

869
02:23:39,484 --> 02:23:41,714
Baiju is back.
- Baiju..?

870
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:44,718
My Baiju is back...?
Baiju is back!

871
02:24:02,273 --> 02:24:04,241
Don't take the boat
into the waters, Baiju!

872
02:24:04,709 --> 02:24:07,576
Where have you hidden Gauri?!
You scoundrel!

873
02:24:07,946 --> 02:24:10,073
You have no sense of dignity!
But l have my honour!

874
02:24:10,281 --> 02:24:12,909
Tell me! Fie on you!

875
02:24:18,857 --> 02:24:21,758
Don't enter the water!
The boat will capsize!

876
02:24:48,686 --> 02:24:50,449
What are you doing?!
- Let me go!

877
02:24:50,588 --> 02:24:53,455
The river is in spate!
- Let me go! She'll die!

878
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:53,382
Baiju, have you won the contest?
- Yes

879
02:25:53,751 --> 02:25:55,719
But l'm losing the battle for my life!

880
02:26:02,694 --> 02:26:04,457
You will not be able
to save me, Gauri!

881
02:26:04,595 --> 02:26:08,053
Swim back to the bank.
- l have crossed my forge!

882
02:26:08,433 --> 02:26:11,061
You know how to swim!
Go back, Gauri!

883
02:26:12,603 --> 02:26:17,870
All you know is l can swim.
But with you, l can even drown!

884
02:26:18,910 --> 02:26:22,471
ln the waters then...
we are to wed, Gauri!
