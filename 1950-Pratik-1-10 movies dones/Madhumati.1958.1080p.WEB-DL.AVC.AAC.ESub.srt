1
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:04,638
What is the time? - It is 8:10.

2
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:07,937
8:10! Pretty late.
Bihari, drive the car faster!

3
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:11,712
Are you mad? Such a stormy night,
and these twisting roads...

4
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:15,230
...one mistake,
and we will go straight down.

5
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,599
We have still to cover 20 miles.
Bihari, why don't U drive faster.

6
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,255
Why are you getting so restless?

7
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:34,493
Why not? The car came late, and
we reach the station late, then...

8
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:37,426
...Radha will be unnecessarily
worried with our small baby.

9
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:41,573
Whether they get worried or not,
you are getting impatient to...

10
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:43,951
...meet your wife and baby.

11
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,027
Who will argue with you now?
Bihari, drive faster.

12
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:09,651
Sir, there are boulders on the road.

13
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,363
Then what are you staring at?
Go and clear the way.

14
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,303
Come, let us also help. - Ok.

15
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:27,566
Can I take this?
- Yes.

16
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:36,045
What has happened?
- Sir, these are big boulders.

17
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,130
I can't move it alone.

18
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,479
You sit in the vehicle.
There is a village nearby.

19
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,986
I will get some men from there.

20
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,775
Ok, go running.

21
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:47,271
Sir.

22
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:50,336
It will take some time.
There is a bungalow up there.

23
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:51,430
Go and rest there.

24
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,781
Don't worry about us.
Go and get the men quickly. Go.

25
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,925
It may take time. Why not go
to the bungalow, perhaps we can...

26
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,005
...arrange a fire.

27
00:04:59,068 --> 00:04:59,589
No, I'll stay here.

28
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,372
Road won't be cleared
if we sit here. Come!

29
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,864
There seems nobody inside.

30
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:35,333
Now that we have come,
let us have a look.

31
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:07,343
Who opened the door?
- Myself. The knob is there.

32
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,169
And who are you?

33
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:14,240
Due to a road block,
we had to halt here.

34
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,002
Will you offer us a place 
to stay for sometime?

35
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:20,087
Yes. Please come in.

36
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:31,623
It seems a very old mansion.

37
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:55,929
Listen, was there a 
painting hanging here?

38
00:06:56,371 --> 00:07:00,012
Yes, but last year, due to 
the quake it fell and broke.

39
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,904
How did you know there
was a painting here?

40
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,972
I don't know. I just felt there
should have been a painting here.

41
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:11,271
Instead of being an engineer,
you should have been a detective.

42
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:15,529
Can you arrange a fire?
It is getting quite cold.

43
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:18,485
Yes. Come upstairs.
- Upstairs?

44
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:19,900
Yes.

45
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,917
I will light the fire for you.

46
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:53,671
Will you be restless like 
this the whole night?

47
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,624
That driver has given
as yet no information.

48
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,340
In this rain and night,
it will take him some...

49
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,594
...time to collect the men,
and clear the road.

50
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,945
Go and look if the
rain has decreased or not.

51
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,911
Doctor.

52
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:23,241
Did you see a stream when
you looked through the window?

53
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,886
Yes, how did you know?

54
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,157
Did you come here earlier.

55
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:33,541
No, but since I have
come to the mansion...

56
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,890
I felt as if I am quite familiar 
with all the things here.

57
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,959
All this is due to
your anxiety and fear.

58
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:42,432
I have some brandy.
Have some and go to sleep.

59
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,661
No, no. I don't want any brandy.

60
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:54,660
Who is it?

61
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:55,630
What happened?

62
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:00,960
Didn't you hear a scream? - No.

63
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,462
May be I had imagined that...

64
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,598
Devan, what are you looking at, 
in this photo?

65
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:08,943
I had made this myself.
- What are you saying!

66
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,046
This painting is quite old.

67
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,988
That I do not know. But I 
recognise each stroke in this.

68
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:20,297
What happened? 
What was the noise?

69
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,095
Ugra Narain! 
- Who is Ugra Narain?

70
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:29,948
He was the last landlord of 
this place. It is his portrait.

71
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:32,142
Deven, but how did you know that?

72
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:38,925
I don't know. But I have made
this portrait with my own hands.

73
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:12,169
I remember now quite clearly.

74
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,139
Who knows when it happened.

75
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:19,322
Perhaps in the last birth.

76
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:25,365
I had come as a manager to
Ugra Narain in these hill tracts.

77
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,763
It was a beautiful day.

78
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,459
Flowers bloomed as 
if to welcome me.

79
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:26,386
A delightful journey, and 
the weather is beautiful.

80
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,050
I am afraid I do not lose myself.

81
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:35,808
A delightful journey,
and the weather is beautiful.

82
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:55,141
Who is it that laughs
hidden in the flowers?

83
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:59,606
To hear whose tune has
the spring become restless.

84
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:04,095
Who is it that laughs
hidden in the flowers?

85
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:08,481
To hear whose tune has
the spring become restless.

86
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,703
Sometimes humming, sometimes 
singing, dances the earth.

87
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,517
A delightful journey,
and weather is beautiful

88
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:22,826
I am afraid I do not lose myself.

89
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:27,778
A delightful journey,
and weather is beautiful.

90
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,601
This wavy and jumpy movements
of these streams looks as if...

91
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:50,084
...as if a rustic is walking
after meeting his lover.

92
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:54,996
This wavy and jumpy movements
of these streams looks as if...

93
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:59,021
...as if a rustic is walking
after meeting his lover.

94
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,193
These visions are all
very loving & very beautiful.

95
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:13,781
A delightful journey and
the weather is also beautiful

96
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:17,991
I am afraid I do not lose myself.

97
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:22,822
A delightful journey, and 
weather is also beautiful.

98
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:54,173
That sky bends down to the earth...

99
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,644
I have seen this union here only.

100
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:03,190
The sky bends down to the earth.

101
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:07,478
I have seen this union here only.

102
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:12,611
My world & my dreams!
Perhaps I will find them here.

103
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:21,735
A delightful journey,
and weather is beautiful.

104
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:26,184
I am afraid I do not lose myself.

105
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:35,766
A delightful journey,
and weather is beautiful.

106
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:47,553
Sir! Don't move forward!

107
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:08,330
Please come..

108
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:15,182
...my stranger.

109
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:40,338
Is the road to Shamgarhi
this one or that?

110
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:51,492
Understood!

111
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:10,795
Look up. Don't be afraid. 
I am not a man! Xx.

112
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:16,380
Then who are you? - If you toss 
up another 2 annas I'll tell.

113
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,716
You can keep the 2annas,
but first climb down.

114
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:20,558
Ok, I'am coming.

115
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:29,421
What has happened? 
Have I become upside down or you?

116
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,525
Now you give me 2 annas
and I will tell you.

117
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,832
Here! Now, we are quits.

118
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:39,476
What is your name? 
- First you tell.

119
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,339
I am Anand. 
- Really then I am Upper Anand.

120
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,364
Hail the lord.

121
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:51,851
Which is the route to 
Shamgarhi timber estate?

122
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,264
Your asking Shamgarhi
timber estates route?

123
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:01,591
You are Anand, isn't it?
- I told you I am Anand.

124
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:05,488
Sir, I am Charandas, and I 
have come to pick you up.

125
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,795
Where is your luggage?

126
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:10,108
My luggage is at the station.

127
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:14,203
The luggage will come later,
you come with me. Come.

128
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,241
This place is quite beautiful.

129
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,872
You feel it is beautiful. 
But ask me.

130
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,347
I took three days to clean it up.  
Dirt and dust.

131
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:55,710
Even liquor couldn't 
have cleaned this.

132
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,462
You seem quite tired.

133
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:03,336
Why not drink a cup of tea?
- I don't need it. I'll get for you.

134
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:09,226
You have come new here.

135
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,536
Here right from top to bottom,
everybody is a thief here.

136
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:15,082
And the accountant here...
he is the biggest...

137
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:18,331
yes, he is the best.
Accountant, welcome.

138
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:20,656
I was praising you only.
You have a long life.

139
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:22,351
Hello Manager. - Hello.

140
00:22:22,483 --> 00:22:24,968
Enroute I hope you didn't
have any difficulty. - No.

141
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,366
I had sent him.

142
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,792
He loves wining and dining. And
enroute is a liquor shop. I hope...

143
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:31,674
...he met you at the station.

144
00:22:33,243 --> 00:22:39,429
Yes, he did. Isn't it, Charan?
- If I hadn't how would he be here.

145
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:44,077
Ok, I will rest and
come for work from tomorrow.

146
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:51,220
Don't worry I am here. Rest for 
two-three days, roam around.

147
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,468
We have beautiful countryside here.
But the sad part is that...

148
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,365
...people here are as bad
as the earth is beautiful here.

149
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,749
You are new here. Take care.

150
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:05,938
Right from top to bottom,
every one is a thief.

151
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:07,882
And he is the boss of all thieves!

152
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:11,510
I am your kid. - Nonsense.
If you don't look after him...

153
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:13,448
...master will cut off your neck!

154
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:19,636
I will not trouble sir, but he 
can give me any trouble he wants.

155
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:25,085
Sir, you rest now, if you need 
anything let me know. Good day.

156
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:33,990
What are you standing here for.
No tea for me.- I'll just get it.

157
00:23:47,749 --> 00:24:02,848
Please come now, my stranger.

158
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:30,539
I am standing here since long,
& eyes are tired waiting for you.

159
00:25:12,825 --> 00:25:15,875
This entire area is ours.

160
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:21,588
The entire work here, is given
to us by Gauriraja.

161
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:26,903
But see our bad luck,
some days back he died.

162
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,471
Now the entire business
has gone to his son.

163
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:33,843
Where is his son?
- He stays in the city somewhere.

164
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:37,641
He is a waster, and he was
not allowed to even come here.

165
00:25:38,124 --> 00:25:40,707
But now since the business is his,
one day he will come here.

166
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,302
Hello Bir Singh.

167
00:25:44,436 --> 00:25:47,691
Sir, this is Bir Singh.
He looks after all the work here.

168
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:51,151
He is our new manager,
Mr Anand. -Salutations.

169
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:52,571
Hello, hello.

170
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:56,036
Bir Singh, how many 
trees did you cut today?

171
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,652
700. 600 have been sent.
100 here and there.

172
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,692
What is this, 100 
'here and there'?

173
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,889
You want to learn everything 
in a day? Leave something for later.

174
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,250
Come, let us go to the office.

175
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,277
Let us go.

176
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:16,686
Accountant, there is a lot
of irregularities in the books.

177
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:21,302
Sir, in such a big business,
little mistakes do occur.

178
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:23,592
But this is bad,
such mistakes should not occur.

179
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:24,729
What? - Sir.

180
00:26:25,906 --> 00:26:26,956
A telegram.

181
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:38,527
Oh my god, what I feared is 
happening. Junior King is coming.

182
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:40,657
But what is there to be afraid of?

183
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:45,056
Yes, we are not thieves.
There is nothing to be afraid of.

184
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:49,056
Bir Singh. Bir Singh, listen.

185
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:58,347
Sir..

186
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:04,261
Did you hear, our new 
Junior King is coming.

187
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:05,737
I have heard that.

188
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:08,987
You have heard, but still 
you are smelling flowers!

189
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:13,118
The entire public is shaken,
and you are so cool.

190
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,245
How will that affect me?

191
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:30,445
Sir, sir, sir...

192
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:35,661
Sir, sir! Are you going that side?

193
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:37,803
Yes, I am going that side.

194
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:43,759
If you are, you will see a 
river ahead. Don't go across that?

195
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:48,553
Why? - There is a big jungle
there full of fierce animals.

196
00:27:50,178 --> 00:27:51,832
But such animals are here also.

197
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,569
Do I look like an animal to you.
Leave the animals, come close.

198
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:02,413
There is a big notice placed there. 
No one can go in.

199
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:07,088
You go your way. - I'll,
but don't go inside there.

200
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:11,653
Be careful,
oops, I was slipping myself.

201
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:42,497
Please come now, my foreigner.

202
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:11,309
I am standing this side for so 
long & my eyes are tired gazing.

203
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:19,528
Come, my foreigner.

204
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:29,324
I am standing since long,
& my eyes are tired gazing.

205
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:37,630
Come, my foreigner.

206
00:30:52,798 --> 00:31:03,396
I am a lamp which is neither 
burning or able to extinguish also.

207
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:15,963
I am a lamp which is neither
burning or able to extinguish also.

208
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:22,025
Please come to meet me,
my life partner.

209
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:34,939
I am standing since long,
my eyes are tired gazing.

210
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:42,895
Come, my foreigner.

211
00:31:57,735 --> 00:32:04,403
You were with me for many 
births, why have you...

212
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:08,002
...forgotten this, my lover.

213
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,308
You were with me for many 
births, why have you...

214
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:22,522
...forgotten this, my lover.

215
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:29,155
I am restless & yearning
for you day and night.

216
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:41,500
I am standing since long,
& my eyes are tired gazing.

217
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:49,427
Come foreigner.

218
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:09,269
I am a river, but 
still I am thirsty.

219
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,719
This mystery is deep,
though the matter is trivial.

220
00:33:19,546 --> 00:33:24,190
I am a river, but 
still I am thirsty.

221
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:28,950
This mystery is deep,
though the matter is trivial.

222
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:34,591
Without you, every breath 
of mine is thirsty.

223
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:47,615
I am standing since long,
& my eyes are tired gazing.

224
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:56,091
Come, my foreigner.

225
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:36,938
Who are you?
What is your name?- Madhumati.

226
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,133
Why did you steal my drawing?

227
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:09,285
Don't cut money this time, I need 
it, cut double next month, sir.

228
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:15,965
No. - Sir, I will die.
- That is not my lookout, go.

229
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:19,621
Kill me, but don't cut my money.

230
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:20,739
Bir Singh.

231
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:30,442
You only do justice, don't cut my 
money this time. I need it badly.

232
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,114
You keep quiet, I will...
- Bir Singh...

233
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,661
return the money.
- But the cutting?

234
00:37:34,702 --> 00:37:36,052
Return the money.

235
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:38,274
Ok.

236
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:10,028
Charan, where are these
girls going? - Girls?

237
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:20,237
Girls are different, they 
come and go like this only.

238
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:23,363
I am just asking,
where are they going?

239
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,374
When they are not coming here,
let them go anywhere?

240
00:38:25,894 --> 00:38:31,078
Beautiful face, very
beautiful eyes, soft cheeks...

241
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:34,918
They are going to the fair,
but you do not go there.

242
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:39,307
Why?-You will get tempted
to buy and regret later.

243
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,179
Will you be going?
- Yes.

244
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:44,305
Then I too will come.

245
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:23,969
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

246
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:31,086
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

247
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:36,891
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

248
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:41,739
Friend, how do I express it?

249
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:48,460
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

250
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:55,407
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

251
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:21,522
He hides and plays 
the flute secretly.

252
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:30,827
He hides and plays only the 
romantic tunes on the flute.

253
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:43,843
He calls me under the stars,

254
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:52,701
He calls me under stars, steals 
my sleep & I remain awake.

255
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,162
The days are small,
and the nights seem long.

256
00:42:56,233 --> 00:43:06,412
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

257
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:11,096
Friend, how should I express it?

258
00:43:11,237 --> 00:43:13,998
I wonder how this affair grew.

259
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:24,513
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

260
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:54,826
While talking, this disease
of love keeps increasing...

261
00:43:54,998 --> 00:44:00,013
...and my heart pines for him more.

262
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:13,029
Somebody see my madness...

263
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:17,066
Somebody see my madness...

264
00:44:17,107 --> 00:44:21,925
I am calling the
moon in my lover's name.

265
00:44:22,312 --> 00:44:25,036
See what is happening to me.

266
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:35,193
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

267
00:44:35,348 --> 00:44:39,926
Friend, how should I express it?

268
00:44:40,032 --> 00:44:46,790
I wonder how it grew, I fell
in love with one who troubles me.

269
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:53,150
I have met the eyes
of one who troubles me.

270
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:49,786
My child, my child.

271
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:51,168
Move.

272
00:45:55,783 --> 00:45:57,001
Watch how you ride!

273
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,292
Who said that?

274
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:06,020
I said it. Couldn't you see?
The child would have died!

275
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,634
Sorry.

276
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:18,110
May you live long, you saved 
my son. You are so brave.

277
00:46:18,216 --> 00:46:20,841
Ok, old lady, take care of the 
child, he is frightened right now.

278
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,626
Sir, are you badly hurt?
- No, it is just a...

279
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,355
Look, blood is coming out.

280
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,028
Give that. I will just come.

281
00:47:16,643 --> 00:47:17,693
Let me see.

282
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:27,993
Madhumati, that day, why did 
you run away? - I got scared.

283
00:47:28,403 --> 00:47:32,210
And now? - Now I am
not scared- And why not?

284
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,931
You are brave, you saved that
boy's life. Else he would have...

285
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:43,342
it is his luck that saved him.
I had nothing to do with it.

286
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:47,647
Is it still paining? - Yes.

287
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:50,734
Then come to my house,
father will put medicine.

288
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:52,825
I hope he will not lose his temper.

289
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:56,835
Why? In fact he will be happy.
- If that is so, let us go.

290
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,566
Listen, walk a bit slowly.
- You come running then.

291
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:20,074
How far is your house? - Come.

292
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:25,887
Come on!

293
00:48:26,923 --> 00:48:29,995
See there, down below.

294
00:48:31,328 --> 00:48:32,521
There below!

295
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:35,136
Yes. 
- But how will we reach there.

296
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:37,240
This way, there is 
a way that side.

297
00:48:39,546 --> 00:48:43,134
This way, no, not me.
I don't want to go.

298
00:48:44,997 --> 00:48:47,209
Nothing will happen.
Come, catch my hand.

299
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:22,699
Come, come. Father!

300
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:25,391
Where did he go?

301
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,405
Father! Father!

302
00:49:31,384 --> 00:49:33,304
You sit down.
I'll see and come.

303
00:49:37,295 --> 00:49:38,585
Father!

304
00:49:42,422 --> 00:49:43,867
Father!

305
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:01,125
Father!

306
00:50:05,826 --> 00:50:06,926
Who are you?

307
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:10,758
Who are you?

308
00:50:12,894 --> 00:50:14,765
I am Anand.

309
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:22,070
How did you come here?

310
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,153
I had come with one...- Who?

311
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:29,999
I brought him.
Father, you know Manglu?

312
00:50:30,137 --> 00:50:32,762
Sir saved his brother's life.

313
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:36,278
He is very brave.
See his hand is cut.

314
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:38,603
Please put some medicine, father.

315
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:40,667
Sit down.

316
00:50:49,153 --> 00:50:54,367
Let me see, where is the injury?
- No injury, only some scratches.

317
00:50:56,454 --> 00:51:02,471
Yes, it is initially only a scratch,
later it becomes a big injury.

318
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:12,500
The medicine is a bit strong.- Yes.

319
00:51:18,181 --> 00:51:20,804
Sir, are you new here?

320
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:23,580
Yes, I came some days back.

321
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,843
To tour or something else?

322
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:27,103
No, I work here.

323
00:51:28,287 --> 00:51:30,875
Where? - In Timber Estate
belonging to the king.

324
00:51:30,973 --> 00:51:33,906
Where? - In king's Timber Estate.

325
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:38,394
Go away from here.
Don't step into this house again.

326
00:51:38,435 --> 00:51:41,101
But what have you against it.
- I don't want to say anything.

327
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:43,806
Father! - I say go away from here.

328
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:51,043
Madhu.

329
00:51:55,941 --> 00:51:56,597
Madhu.

330
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:05,422
Father, he doesn't know the way.
- He will find out, come inside.

331
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:29,709
Charan, who is it? - It is me.

332
00:52:30,116 --> 00:52:31,920
Sir here, oh!

333
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:38,088
Where were you lost in the fair?

334
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:42,033
Charan, across the river.
Who stays there.

335
00:52:42,144 --> 00:52:44,804
Behind the valley,
in the centre of the jungle?

336
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,054
Will you tell, or you 
will keep jabbering?

337
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,601
Sir, you will get hot,
and the food will get cold.

338
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:52,658
Who is that old man?

339
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:58,931
Him? He is the Panda King.
Their forefathers were kings...

340
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:01,238
...so the foresters
still call him King.

341
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:07,578
Is there some enmity
of the company with him.

342
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:11,847
Enemity? Company people are
not allowed to cross over the...

343
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:15,163
...stream into that area.
Nor are they allowed this side.

344
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:16,000
Why?

345
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:20,381
Many years back, when company
crimes increased, this Pawan...

346
00:53:20,422 --> 00:53:23,255
...Raja's son got the villagers
together and came to fight...

347
00:53:23,296 --> 00:53:24,564
...with the company people.

348
00:53:24,841 --> 00:53:30,221
Bir Singh stabbed him
in the back and killed him.

349
00:53:30,382 --> 00:53:33,190
The company people also committed
many atrocities against them.

350
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:39,270
Oh, my God. I have said something
I should not have. Listen...

351
00:53:39,453 --> 00:53:40,187
What?

352
00:53:40,355 --> 00:53:45,866
The local king here is also
worth mentioning. He is great.

353
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:47,582
Why don't you eat some rice?

354
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:00,501
Jivan, how is it going.
- All well sir.

355
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,510
Sir, you are the boss, there 
is no need for you to come...

356
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:08,900
...everyday into the forest.
Sit in the office.

357
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:16,111
For this place, I am there.
The labor gets scared of you.

358
00:54:16,692 --> 00:54:18,119
Am I the devil that
they get scared of me?

359
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:20,982
You have been called
by the Rajasaheb.

360
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:23,360
I am a bit busy,
tell him I will come a bit late.

361
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:28,616
Listen, you go now.
This Raja saheb is bossy.

362
00:54:29,118 --> 00:54:32,638
But he likes being pampered.

363
00:54:32,907 --> 00:54:37,070
If you can... - I'll try 
& remember your advice.

364
00:55:30,575 --> 00:55:32,037
Did you like the painting?

365
00:55:33,683 --> 00:55:34,683
You!

366
00:55:35,557 --> 00:55:36,303
Greetings.

367
00:55:36,423 --> 00:55:42,461
The manager! You are brave.
I saw the proof in the fair.

368
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:47,140
You had called me?
- Yes, out of necessity.

369
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:51,504
On coming here, from the police
to the accountant, everyone...

370
00:55:51,545 --> 00:55:54,560
...called on me, on arrival.
Only you did not come.

371
00:55:54,956 --> 00:55:58,667
You see, on coming here,
I got busy on some jobs...

372
00:55:58,714 --> 00:55:59,511
Listen..

373
00:55:59,971 --> 00:56:02,479
It is the tradition here to come 
to salute master when he comes.

374
00:56:02,804 --> 00:56:07,370
Remember it for the future.
- I will, now that I know.

375
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:11,276
What was the work?
- Just checking the old accounts...

376
00:56:11,317 --> 00:56:13,312
...there were some irregularities.
- Have they been sorted out?

377
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:16,378
No, not as yet. It will take 
some time to correct it.

378
00:56:17,143 --> 00:56:18,421
If you had seen,
you would have understood.

379
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,788
If I had to see,
why would I hire you?

380
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:26,288
In matters of accounts, and 
money, don't trust any servant.

381
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:28,968
I would say, not even me.

382
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:34,864
I admire the way you speak.
I stay mostly in the city, but...

383
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,503
...at times I have to 
come to this jungle.

384
00:56:38,697 --> 00:56:40,741
Where there are mere servants,

385
00:56:41,036 --> 00:56:43,600
if I can speak to someone like you,
what more would I want?

386
00:56:44,176 --> 00:56:46,312
Cigarette? -No, thank you.

387
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:53,296
Ram Singh, where were you?
Open the shoes. Bloody animal.

388
00:56:54,457 --> 00:56:55,707
You can go now.

389
00:56:56,929 --> 00:56:58,877
Farewell-Hurry up!

390
00:57:24,683 --> 00:57:28,346
Sir, don't mistake father.
He is good at heart.

391
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:31,071
I heard. Where are you going?
- The village across.

392
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:34,189
I will meet tomorrow.
- Where? Now at this moment.

393
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:36,375
Where the shadow of
this hill is falling, there.

394
00:57:36,555 --> 00:57:37,344
Madhu.

395
00:57:37,474 --> 00:57:38,774
Coming father.

396
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:42,815
Where had you halted?

397
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:45,585
I got a thorn on my foot.
- Come along.

398
00:58:15,888 --> 00:58:19,052
Sir, sir..

399
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:22,255
Sir, I have come.

400
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,821
But I had thought...
- That I wouldn't come?

401
00:58:26,018 --> 00:58:28,247
Yes. - But hadn't I 
given you my word.

402
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:30,942
Look! See how the tree sways.

403
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,395
Like this and this way.

404
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:39,360
How happy it is? I too am happy.

405
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:44,883
But why are you happy?
- I am happy just like that.

406
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,673
Madhumati. - Yes.

407
00:58:58,506 --> 00:59:02,500
I will make a portrait of you?
- My portrait?

408
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:11,048
Make it! - Not like this. 
Come here.

409
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:14,110
Sit down here.

410
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:34,119
I can't sit longer. If you were
a girl, you would know the problems.

411
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:36,587
I am getting late.

412
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:39,613
Wait for little time.
Your picture is almost ready.

413
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:50,309
See sir, come here.
Come here.

414
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:52,691
What happened?

415
00:59:53,087 --> 00:59:54,944
See the ants are going home.

416
00:59:57,788 --> 00:59:59,224
So what they are going home.

417
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:03,246
See water is coming!
- Where is the water coming?

418
01:00:30,148 --> 01:00:31,314
Where have you gone?

419
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:32,575
Hey.

420
01:00:32,949 --> 01:00:35,122
The nose you have 
made a little long.

421
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:39,008
I told you sit there.
Suppose the sun sets.

422
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:43,036
Sun? Do you know where it
goes after sunset?

423
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,473
Come, I'll show you.

424
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:55,090
Behind that hill it gets into a cave,
and next morning it comes...

425
01:00:57,009 --> 01:00:59,090
...out of the caves behind that hill.

426
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:03,886
It cannot be. - Why not?
At night when we sleep, it goes...

427
01:01:04,226 --> 01:01:08,484
...through netherworld,
and comes out from that side.

428
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:12,343
From down below? - Yes, you 
don't even know this much!

429
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:17,377
Who will explain such
complicated things? - I will.

430
01:01:18,294 --> 01:01:23,983
Ok, you will explain, and I will 
understand. Now sit down there.

431
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:29,918
Go, come on go.

432
01:01:33,209 --> 01:01:35,836
Do you think I am a tree or a 
stone that I stay at one place.

433
01:01:37,363 --> 01:01:43,895
We will roam, and stroll and talk.
Of that nothing!

434
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,703
What are you looking at? - You.

435
01:02:06,485 --> 01:02:10,532
You know God has made you
so beautiful, I cannot make a...

436
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:12,571
...picture of you.

437
01:02:21,323 --> 01:02:22,533
Look this side.

438
01:02:29,261 --> 01:02:30,496
Turn your face.

439
01:02:47,107 --> 01:02:48,396
Somebody is coming.

440
01:03:03,626 --> 01:03:06,888
Great, I never knew you draw also.

441
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:10,319
I draw a few lines here 
and there. - No, Anand.

442
01:03:10,816 --> 01:03:14,488
I may not have any great qualities,
but I have an eye for good art.

443
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:17,501
Such a beautiful
picture only an artist can make.

444
01:03:18,436 --> 01:03:23,557
This beautiful girl. Who is she?
- It is just from imagination.

445
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:28,259
Your imagination is great.
Come sometime to the mansion.

446
01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:31,328
Where is the time,
there is so much of work...

447
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:34,243
Oh, I see. You are right.

448
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:54,972
Let me go.
- No, no, I will not listen.

449
01:03:55,122 --> 01:04:02,308
Please have mercy let me go.
- No, no one can go from here.

450
01:04:02,894 --> 01:04:05,711
My son has been bitten 
by a snake, he will die!

451
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:10,792
What can I do if he dies.
No one can go from here.

452
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:13,839
What is the matter?
- Sir, he is not allowing me...

453
01:04:13,887 --> 01:04:17,550
...to go to the other side. My
son has been bitten by a snake and...

454
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:26,753
...he will surely die, if he 
is not treated. Please tell him!

455
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:29,398
Let her go.- But king
has given strict orders.

456
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,238
I will talk to the
king you let her go.

457
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:33,756
God bless you, Sir.

458
01:04:34,568 --> 01:04:36,589
Halt! - Bir Singh.

459
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:41,267
You can go.

460
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:09,380
Sit down. I have understood,
but why is our new manager so...

461
01:05:09,974 --> 01:05:12,404
...much interested in that area.

462
01:05:13,345 --> 01:05:19,521
The old man has a daughter, and 
Mr Anand is having some affair!!

463
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:26,805
Can't blame him. That girl is
too beautiful.

464
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:31,190
So, that's the reason.

465
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:32,013
Yes.

466
01:05:32,627 --> 01:05:38,877
You have come after so many years.
She is a like a beautiful...

467
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,628
...picture but Anand
still makes only her picture.

468
01:05:42,048 --> 01:05:44,579
And he keeps meeting
her near the spring.

469
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:12,256
Are you in any hurry 
to go somewhere?

470
01:06:12,497 --> 01:06:14,404
Yes, my work has
finished for today. l...

471
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:18,005
But my work is left.
These are some estate accounts.

472
01:06:18,355 --> 01:06:20,052
Have a look and make the summary.

473
01:06:20,347 --> 01:06:24,745
I will do it tomorrow. 
- No, Anand, it has to be done today.

474
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:28,958
Tomorrow morning it has 
to be sent. Thank you.

475
01:07:12,347 --> 01:07:19,023
Every moment my heart pounds,
why is it so?

476
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:25,998
Today at the time to meet,
why does my cover slip.

477
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:32,763
Every moment my heart 
pounds, why is it so?

478
01:07:33,162 --> 01:07:39,577
Today at the time to meet,
why does my cover slip.

479
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,784
Every moment my heart pounds.

480
01:08:00,652 --> 01:08:07,341
In exchange of my whole life,
I had asked for this evening.

481
01:08:11,177 --> 01:08:20,736
I will get lost today,
just holding his hands.

482
01:08:21,813 --> 01:08:28,350
I got love today as much as I wanted.
My heart pounds! Why is it so?

483
01:08:28,391 --> 01:08:35,290
At the time of meeting,
why does my cover slip?

484
01:08:35,385 --> 01:08:41,886
Every moment my heart pounds,
why is it so?

485
01:08:42,136 --> 01:08:48,362
Today at the time to meet,
why does my cover slip.

486
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:52,845
Every moment my heart pounds.

487
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:12,792
Birds, you keep quiet today
and I too will remain silent.

488
01:09:16,612 --> 01:09:26,088
My lover will understand
what the heart says by himself.

489
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:33,785
See my heart pounds, I'm losing 
my courage, why does it beat.

490
01:09:34,095 --> 01:09:40,760
Today at the time to meet,
why does my cover slip?

491
01:09:40,836 --> 01:09:47,478
My heart pounds, why does it...

492
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:54,268
Today at the time to meet,
why does my cover slip.

493
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:58,937
Every moment my heart pounds.

494
01:10:03,106 --> 01:10:05,273
So you are the imagination of Anand?

495
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,531
Leave me!

496
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:44,839
The heart in pain asks you
to come hither...

497
01:12:44,879 --> 01:12:49,879
don't avoid looking at me,
please come forth, I swear.

498
01:12:52,528 --> 01:12:56,448
The heart in pain asks you
to come hither...

499
01:12:56,499 --> 01:13:01,410
don't avoid looking at me,
please come forth, I swear.

500
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:19,900
Without you, there is no spring.

501
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:24,355
The flowers don't bloom
as they are waiting for you.

502
01:13:24,915 --> 01:13:29,290
Without you, there is no spring.

503
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,039
The flowers don't bloom
as they are waiting for you.

504
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:37,785
You are awaited.

505
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:42,186
The heart in pain asks you
to come hither...

506
01:13:42,227 --> 01:13:47,157
don't avoid looking at me,
please come forth, I swear.

507
01:13:49,838 --> 01:13:53,577
The heart in pain gives
you this punishment...

508
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:58,490
...I am yours now,
I am with you forever.

509
01:13:58,874 --> 01:14:02,633
The heart in pain gives
you this punishment...

510
01:14:02,713 --> 01:14:07,586
...I am yours now,
I am with you forever.

511
01:14:17,064 --> 01:14:21,085
For you only I have
this beauty in my life...

512
01:14:21,482 --> 01:14:25,628
I am living for
I am in love with you.

513
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:30,166
For you only I have
this beauty in my life...

514
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:33,977
I am living for
I am in love with you.

515
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:38,630
Only because, I am 
in love with you.

516
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:43,111
The heart in pain asks you
to come hither...

517
01:14:43,152 --> 01:14:48,106
don't avoid looking at me,
please come forth, I swear.

518
01:14:48,406 --> 01:14:52,050
The heart in pain gives
you this punishment...

519
01:14:52,152 --> 01:14:57,214
...I am yours now,
I am with you forever.

520
01:15:10,987 --> 01:15:15,232
The effect of love
is smiling everywhere.

521
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:19,658
Where am I and where is my heart,
I do not know...

522
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:24,071
The effect of love
is felt smiling everywhere.

523
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:28,111
Where am I and where is 
my heart, I do not know...

524
01:15:28,348 --> 01:15:32,939
Where is it, I do not know.

525
01:15:33,608 --> 01:15:37,287
The heart in pain asks you
to come hither...

526
01:15:37,415 --> 01:15:42,299
don't avoid looking at me,
please come forth, I swear.

527
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:46,288
The heart in pain gives
you this punishment...

528
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:51,640
...I am yours now,
I am with you forever.

529
01:15:52,454 --> 01:15:53,454
Come close to me.

530
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,586
Don't talk to me. 
Why didn't you come yesterday?

531
01:16:03,264 --> 01:16:08,747
You don't understand. To be 
a male, can be a big problem.

532
01:16:09,127 --> 01:16:10,882
We have to earn bread.

533
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:14,301
And those who give bread
leave no time for love.

534
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:17,219
Then why do you do such a job?
- What else will I do?

535
01:16:19,113 --> 01:16:23,657
Do you know that with love,
there is hunger also.

536
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:29,289
I will bring your bread.
- Ok, and clothes?

537
01:16:29,702 --> 01:16:32,156
Clothes? That too I will
bring from father.

538
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:34,038
And house?

539
01:16:34,162 --> 01:16:36,460
Enough, your demands 
are increasing.

540
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:41,480
Yesterday you didn't come.

541
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,574
Suppose something
happened to me then?

542
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,176
What would have happened?

543
01:16:45,283 --> 01:16:48,901
Suppose there was a problem!
- Don't talk like that.

544
01:16:50,045 --> 01:16:52,651
Suppose someone tries to snatch 
me away, what will you do?

545
01:16:53,819 --> 01:17:00,097
I will kill him, who is he?
- No one, I was just asking.

546
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:09,524
Today, we will go and
sit somewhere else. - Where?

547
01:17:09,629 --> 01:17:10,758
Come with me.

548
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:40,750
How much long we've to go.

549
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,070
Are you looking that mountain
on the top of it.

550
01:17:43,149 --> 01:17:43,852
That?

551
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,320
Let see who will go first.

552
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:10,773
Madhu.

553
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,641
Madhu. - Sir.

554
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:18,123
Where was you?

555
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,615
Our ancestors are
in this gravestones.

556
01:18:20,948 --> 01:18:22,473
I have greet them and came.

557
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:27,799
What a strange place is this?
- That is why I got you here.

558
01:18:29,141 --> 01:18:29,719
Yes.

559
01:18:30,776 --> 01:18:34,663
You see these old stones. This are 
gravestones of our ancestors.

560
01:18:38,574 --> 01:18:42,076
How peaceful is
this place?- Isn't it?

561
01:18:43,392 --> 01:18:49,050
Whenever I am sad,
I come here. Alone.

562
01:18:51,115 --> 01:18:59,242
Then I don't feel alone.
I feel they are all with me.

563
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,742
And they talk to me.
- What are you saying?

564
01:19:04,457 --> 01:19:09,178
It is true!
Nothing dies on this earth.

565
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:33,648
See, it appears the stars
are below and we have come up.

566
01:19:34,275 --> 01:19:36,349
There is some dance
and frolic in the village.

567
01:19:38,081 --> 01:19:40,219
Come let us go and see.
- Yes, let us go.

568
01:20:21,886 --> 01:20:29,422
Oh, a scorpion!

569
01:20:30,967 --> 01:20:39,164
For a moment I sat under
the shadow of the fig tree...

570
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:44,720
...after filling my pot...

571
01:20:59,233 --> 01:21:05,347
Oh my god, a scorpion 
has come on to me.

572
01:21:05,388 --> 01:21:11,596
Oh, I will die, someone 
take away this scorpion.

573
01:21:11,637 --> 01:21:18,037
Oh my god, a scorpion 
has come on to me.

574
01:21:18,137 --> 01:21:24,003
How the sinner Scorpion came here?

575
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:30,810
Oh my god, a scorpion 
has come on to me.

576
01:21:46,775 --> 01:22:00,065
I say the magic chanting,
that it is a delicate skin...

577
01:22:00,842 --> 01:22:13,003
...leave the girl, go.
Go, Go, Go away.

578
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:23,469
The scorpion climbed
further over the body.

579
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:29,530
What a fire was lit 
by the scorpion!

580
01:22:29,618 --> 01:22:35,888
The scorpion climbed
all over the body.

581
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:42,086
See the sinful scorpion.

582
01:22:42,181 --> 01:22:48,439
Oh my god, a scorpion 
has come on to me.

583
01:23:20,011 --> 01:23:28,568
We said the chantings...
We sought the doctors...

584
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:36,619
My love, please come back home...

585
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:09,725
See the scorpion has come down.

586
01:24:09,766 --> 01:24:15,983
Yes, the scorpion has gone away.

587
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:22,187
Seeing my lover, we don't know 
where the scorpion has gone.

588
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:28,417
See the sinful scorpion!

589
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:34,476
Oh my god, a scorpion 
has come on to me.

590
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:41,487
Oh, I will die, someone 
take away this scorpion.

591
01:25:28,368 --> 01:25:35,682
You don't know, sir is scared of me,
like a crow of a catapult.

592
01:25:36,959 --> 01:25:41,768
And I don't bother of him.
More you bother about them...

593
01:25:41,892 --> 01:25:43,734
...and they climb on your head!

594
01:25:43,927 --> 01:25:48,826
Talk of today.
He was not giving leave.

595
01:25:49,055 --> 01:25:51,800
When I lost my temper,
he became a sheep.

596
01:25:53,464 --> 01:26:00,601
He folded his hands and said,
your name is Charandas, but...

597
01:26:00,642 --> 01:26:06,602
...in fact I am your servant.
He caught my feet & wouldn't leave.

598
01:26:06,717 --> 01:26:08,843
He kept crying. - Then?

599
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:12,145
He gave me this nice suit. - Then?

600
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:16,254
He gave me this hat
worth Rs 501-. - Then?

601
01:26:16,295 --> 01:26:20,119
He took out this nice shoe. - Then?

602
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:30,576
Then I took out a tie.
In the hope that if Sir asks me...

603
01:26:30,617 --> 01:26:32,771
...I will say sorry. - Then?

604
01:26:33,144 --> 01:26:37,519
Then what. Here is your shoe,
& here is my head. Please start.

605
01:26:37,841 --> 01:26:42,270
Sir, this is your shoe only.
- Sir, leave him. Forgive him.

606
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:45,592
Madhu is saying something.
- Don't do such acts again.

607
01:26:46,245 --> 01:26:51,926
I will write it down, for the next
7 generations no one'll do such...

608
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:57,527
...a mistake. 
It is all due to this liquor.

609
01:26:58,007 --> 01:27:01,032
Don't ever drink
it is a very bad thing.

610
01:27:06,836 --> 01:27:09,891
See! This is how one gets
out of a tricky situation!

611
01:27:10,442 --> 01:27:11,950
You dance, very well.

612
01:27:13,507 --> 01:27:15,294
It's too late
father will shout.

613
01:27:16,262 --> 01:27:18,014
I can reach home early
from jungles way.

614
01:27:18,235 --> 01:27:20,943
Won't you feel scared alone,
so late at night?

615
01:27:22,356 --> 01:27:26,039
I am a jungle girl, meet me 
tomorrow near the spring.

616
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,030
You must come. - Ok, see you.

617
01:28:22,854 --> 01:28:24,405
Where are you going?

618
01:28:28,177 --> 01:28:29,677
Where are you going?

619
01:28:30,992 --> 01:28:36,238
Go inside.
Don't step out till I return.

620
01:31:31,035 --> 01:31:33,333
What can I do if
I feel like laughing.

621
01:31:41,767 --> 01:31:44,275
Write my name too, on this tree.

622
01:31:48,446 --> 01:31:51,307
Sir... Sir.

623
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:10,932
You! I was dreaming of you only.

624
01:32:21,757 --> 01:32:24,170
Sir, how are you here?

625
01:32:25,238 --> 01:32:26,247
I have come for you.

626
01:32:27,536 --> 01:32:28,901
Has father seen you?

627
01:32:51,312 --> 01:32:56,437
Sir, you are all wet. Sit down.

628
01:32:57,495 --> 01:32:58,487
Sit down.

629
01:33:11,012 --> 01:33:12,362
You have fever.

630
01:33:15,092 --> 01:33:16,845
- Don't do like this again.

631
01:33:17,647 --> 01:33:18,847
What happened?

632
01:33:20,278 --> 01:33:24,889
You didn't come & strange 
thoughts came to my mind.

633
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:31,081
I was feeling suffocated.
Then the storm came.

634
01:33:32,459 --> 01:33:35,544
Lightning crackled and rain
surrounded me from all directions.

635
01:33:37,376 --> 01:33:43,648
A storm rose in my mind. 
I couldn't hold myself. I came out.

636
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:50,933
I fell and stood up several times.
I had lost my balance.

637
01:33:52,613 --> 01:33:57,206
I could only see and think of you.

638
01:34:11,075 --> 01:34:14,972
I am saying the truth,
Don't ever do it again.

639
01:34:16,957 --> 01:34:20,565
You are crying?

640
01:34:22,507 --> 01:34:24,977
You have suffered
a lot on account of me.

641
01:34:26,943 --> 01:34:29,217
And I just slept here.

642
01:34:30,536 --> 01:34:35,932
This should happen always.
Whatever storms come...

643
01:34:35,973 --> 01:34:40,876
...let them come to me only,
so that you can sleep in peace.

644
01:34:41,702 --> 01:34:48,578
No, without you I cannot live. I say,
if I live, it will be with you...

645
01:34:50,103 --> 01:34:54,417
...and if I die,
it will be with you.

646
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:55,458
No.

647
01:34:55,774 --> 01:35:01,665
It is true, even when I die,
I will be near you only.

648
01:35:04,377 --> 01:35:09,334
If I laugh it will be with you,
and if I cry it will be with you.

649
01:35:36,977 --> 01:35:38,149
How came here?

650
01:35:43,691 --> 01:35:46,746
Tell now. Speak!

651
01:35:56,969 --> 01:36:00,127
Ok, I will see myself.

652
01:36:03,643 --> 01:36:04,643
Father!

653
01:36:12,594 --> 01:36:13,360
Father!

654
01:36:20,672 --> 01:36:21,524
Father!

655
01:36:26,226 --> 01:36:28,903
Where are you running away, after
trying to steal my self respect?

656
01:36:29,234 --> 01:36:30,992
You lowly scoundrel! You wretch!

657
01:36:39,372 --> 01:36:44,183
Here! You can kill me, but don't 
make such cheap allegations.

658
01:36:44,454 --> 01:36:46,995
Such cheap and false acts is 
the religion of people like you.

659
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,608
Sin is a part of your blood.

660
01:36:49,936 --> 01:36:52,693
There is no sin in my blood,
there is falseness in your vision.

661
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:57,871
There is falseness in my vision?
In my vision? - Father!

662
01:36:57,944 --> 01:36:59,225
Get aside Madhu.

663
01:36:59,956 --> 01:37:03,134
I will die, but I'll not allow 
anyone to tarnish our love.

664
01:37:03,175 --> 01:37:04,831
You have fever of love?

665
01:37:04,925 --> 01:37:07,267
It will be there till I die.
- You are lying!

666
01:37:07,308 --> 01:37:08,847
No, father, he is 
telling the truth.

667
01:37:08,893 --> 01:37:11,978
Fool, you don't know
these treacherous people.

668
01:37:12,489 --> 01:37:16,704
Ask him, will he marry you? 
Ask him!

669
01:37:21,572 --> 01:37:26,069
Will you marry me?

670
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:33,925
Yes Madhu, if your father 
gives me permission.

671
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,695
Animal, you talk all rot.

672
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:43,301
I don't know.
I want that girl. That is all.

673
01:38:43,527 --> 01:38:46,145
Sir, the job is not that easy.

674
01:38:46,317 --> 01:38:48,112
It is like putting a 
hand in a tiger's mouth.

675
01:38:48,153 --> 01:38:51,621
Quiet! Present the girl,
whatever it be.

676
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:56,215
There is a way.
There is a Chandanpur fair.

677
01:38:56,629 --> 01:39:00,243
The old man visits there for 2 days.
If you can send Anand for two days...

678
01:39:00,387 --> 01:39:03,848
...out on duty, this 
job can be done easily.

679
01:39:05,309 --> 01:39:06,996
It will be arranged.

680
01:39:15,762 --> 01:39:19,321
Now give me the pack. 
- Return soon!

681
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,843
I am going to the fair.
It would take one or two days.

682
01:39:23,147 --> 01:39:27,028
And I too am in a hurry.
I have to arrange your marriage.

683
01:39:28,746 --> 01:39:32,213
Listen, what should I get
from the fair for my daughter?

684
01:39:33,231 --> 01:39:34,937
Whatever you feel appropriate.

685
01:39:35,156 --> 01:39:40,125
My heart desires a lot for you. You
should be married like a princess.

686
01:39:40,879 --> 01:39:43,876
Today I am a king only in name...

687
01:39:44,921 --> 01:39:46,317
...alas, if your brother was alive.

688
01:39:46,427 --> 01:39:51,663
Father, Get red color bangles
for me from the fair. - Ok, I will.

689
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:04,295
I had to call you here.

690
01:40:04,697 --> 01:40:08,109
For several days I have told
friends I will arrange a hunt.

691
01:40:08,808 --> 01:40:10,162
All arrangements have been made.

692
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:12,838
But from Neelpur there
is news of some urgent work.

693
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,715
For two three days I won't be here,
but going to Neelpur is...

694
01:40:15,756 --> 01:40:16,842
...also essential.

695
01:40:17,717 --> 01:40:19,473
Please tell me how can I help you?

696
01:40:19,849 --> 01:40:24,778
You can go to Neelpur,
and do my work.

697
01:40:24,987 --> 01:40:25,731
But sir...

698
01:40:25,772 --> 01:40:27,739
I have made all arrangements
for your going.

699
01:40:28,103 --> 01:40:30,513
Go as early as possible. - Right.

700
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:32,536
See you. - Okay.

701
01:40:44,411 --> 01:40:47,103
No, I will not allow you to go.

702
01:40:48,145 --> 01:40:49,689
Why will you not let me go.

703
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:52,907
I feel scared without you.

704
01:40:53,035 --> 01:40:56,114
And you say, I never 
feel scared, that too...

705
01:40:56,224 --> 01:40:58,130
No, not like that. - Then?

706
01:40:58,593 --> 01:41:01,556
Father is not here, 
and you too are going.

707
01:41:02,532 --> 01:41:04,928
And your Raja saheb...

708
01:41:06,083 --> 01:41:07,599
...he is not a good man.

709
01:41:09,544 --> 01:41:10,325
Listen..

710
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:13,016
Don't worry about him.

711
01:41:13,963 --> 01:41:16,278
He is going with his
friends for a hunt...

712
01:41:16,795 --> 01:41:19,372
...and I will return
before he comes back.

713
01:41:20,689 --> 01:41:23,750
Look I am going, 
and you smile a bit!

714
01:41:26,169 --> 01:41:29,677
Look.

715
01:41:33,163 --> 01:41:35,918
If you have to go, 
then come with me.

716
01:41:36,110 --> 01:41:38,426
Where? - To take
the Lord's blessings.

717
01:41:39,849 --> 01:41:41,739
Let's go. - Come.

718
01:42:29,074 --> 01:42:31,999
The flower fell!
- So what, if the flower fell?

719
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:38,494
It is a very bad sign.
If one's flower falls, one dies!

720
01:42:39,016 --> 01:42:41,259
You are unnecessarily
saying bad things.

721
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:48,476
No. I don't want to die. 
Before meeting you...

722
01:42:49,162 --> 01:42:51,282
I was not scared of death,

723
01:42:51,693 --> 01:42:57,233
Now I want to live.
For you I want to live.

724
01:43:06,117 --> 01:43:10,403
Lord, I am not even married.

725
01:43:19,432 --> 01:43:21,366
Now you are a married lady.

726
01:43:32,571 --> 01:43:34,064
God is witness.

727
01:44:22,861 --> 01:44:27,720
You give this tonight... 
that is it!

728
01:44:27,761 --> 01:44:30,345
Don't worry boss, I will give 
so much, that for two days...

729
01:44:30,386 --> 01:44:32,314
...the effect will last.

730
01:44:32,355 --> 01:44:36,009
Good, I will do the same. - Yes.

731
01:44:43,541 --> 01:44:45,932
Ohhh!!! The bottle is empty.

732
01:44:47,181 --> 01:44:47,955
Should I get more?

733
01:44:48,211 --> 01:44:53,764
No, I have taken a lot.
Not a drop more. You know...

734
01:44:53,957 --> 01:44:57,150
...sir has forbidden
me to drink anymore.

735
01:45:21,431 --> 01:45:27,416
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

736
01:45:27,541 --> 01:45:31,643
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

737
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:37,116
But when I drink a little,
and swing, everybody sees.

738
01:45:37,157 --> 01:45:43,358
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

739
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:48,827
But when I drink a little,
and swing, everybody sees.

740
01:45:48,875 --> 01:45:52,542
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

741
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:18,454
The fair maiden's big
eyes are intoxicating...

742
01:46:18,495 --> 01:46:22,987
...they have destroyed
the peace of many.

743
01:46:24,089 --> 01:46:28,136
The fair maidens big
eyes are intoxicating...

744
01:46:28,236 --> 01:46:31,956
...they have destroyed
the peace of many.

745
01:46:32,046 --> 01:46:35,776
Nobody sees this crime they commit.

746
01:46:36,107 --> 01:46:41,558
But when I drink a little,
and swing, everybody sees.

747
01:46:41,599 --> 01:46:47,690
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

748
01:46:47,902 --> 01:46:53,417
But when I drink a little,
and swing, everybody sees.

749
01:46:53,469 --> 01:46:57,959
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

750
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:22,818
Some have a craving
for the green bucks.

751
01:47:22,868 --> 01:47:26,427
Some have a craving
for good clothes, suits.

752
01:47:27,236 --> 01:47:32,321
Some have a craving
for the green bucks.

753
01:47:32,595 --> 01:47:36,236
Some have a craving
for good clothes, suits.

754
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,149
Friends I have a craving
for simple liquor!

755
01:47:40,326 --> 01:47:45,955
But when I drink a little,
and swing, everybody sees.

756
01:47:45,996 --> 01:47:51,480
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

757
01:47:52,182 --> 01:47:57,479
But when I drink a little,
and swing, everybody sees.

758
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,770
No one has seen a peacock
dancing in the jungle.

759
01:48:08,931 --> 01:48:11,688
A disaster has occurred.
- Disaster?

760
01:48:11,858 --> 01:48:16,426
If I had sung a bit more lustily
something more would have happened.

761
01:48:17,004 --> 01:48:19,471
A disaster has happened.
Anand has met with an accident.

762
01:48:19,512 --> 01:48:20,512
Accident? - Yes.

763
01:48:20,637 --> 01:48:26,535
He has been brought to mansion. 
He is crying Madhu's name.

764
01:48:26,606 --> 01:48:30,035
You fetch Madhu, and 
I will get the Doctor.

765
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:41,794
Madhu.

766
01:48:43,981 --> 01:48:44,840
Madhu.

767
01:48:45,043 --> 01:48:49,863
Madhu, while going to Neelpur,
Anand has met with an accident.

768
01:48:50,005 --> 01:48:51,981
He is injured very badly. Injured.

769
01:48:55,046 --> 01:48:56,995
Where is Anand?
- In Raja sir's mansion.

770
01:48:57,081 --> 01:48:57,736
Why there?

771
01:48:57,777 --> 01:49:01,167
The villagers brought him
in injured condition there.

772
01:49:01,629 --> 01:49:03,162
He is repeatedly
calling out your name.

773
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:04,439
Come.

774
01:49:29,926 --> 01:49:30,926
Sir...

775
01:49:37,995 --> 01:49:41,357
I have come. 
What happened to you?

776
01:49:42,389 --> 01:49:44,561
Sir...?

777
01:51:03,397 --> 01:51:05,373
Leave my baggage at my place.
I will just come.

778
01:51:05,746 --> 01:51:10,115
Just a minute. Ok, go now.

779
01:51:17,121 --> 01:51:20,738
Madhu, give me a 
glass of water, dear.

780
01:51:26,077 --> 01:51:26,873
Madhu?

781
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:30,444
Madhu?

782
01:51:53,131 --> 01:51:54,975
Madhu.

783
01:52:06,008 --> 01:52:08,418
Where is Madhu? - Where is she?

784
01:52:08,524 --> 01:52:11,770
I have just returned from 
the fair. At home she was...

785
01:52:12,225 --> 01:52:14,787
...not there, and there
was burnt rice on the stove.

786
01:52:15,103 --> 01:52:16,790
And she was not there!
Did she meet you?

787
01:52:17,068 --> 01:52:20,092
No, I was for two days in
Neelpur and have just returned.

788
01:52:20,611 --> 01:52:24,530
Then there has been some calamity.
Let us search for her.

789
01:52:31,056 --> 01:52:33,095
Madhu.

790
01:52:40,924 --> 01:52:43,830
Madhu.

791
01:52:53,023 --> 01:52:54,124
Madhu.

792
01:53:07,866 --> 01:53:08,898
Madhu.

793
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:11,888
What happened?

794
01:53:16,273 --> 01:53:17,140
What happened?

795
01:53:17,555 --> 01:53:23,106
Looking for her appears futile.
Some wild animal has eaten her.

796
01:53:27,185 --> 01:53:30,492
No, this cannot happen.

797
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:32,913
This cannot happen.

798
01:53:37,647 --> 01:53:39,116
Madhu?

799
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:58,553
Come, my foreigner.

800
01:54:01,686 --> 01:54:12,501
The darkness of night has come...

801
01:54:21,306 --> 01:54:26,993
The darknessof night 
has come again...

802
01:54:27,564 --> 01:54:28,775
Madhu?

803
01:54:29,874 --> 01:54:36,210
Where is Madhu?
- Now where is Madhu, sir.

804
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,034
I just heard her voice.
Didn't you hear?

805
01:54:40,914 --> 01:54:41,750
No.

806
01:54:44,788 --> 01:54:51,473
There you can hear
her voice Come with me.

807
01:54:58,647 --> 01:55:01,497
Did you hear her?

808
01:55:05,688 --> 01:55:06,721
Where, sir?

809
01:55:08,313 --> 01:55:11,937
You are not hearing her?
- No...

810
01:55:14,296 --> 01:55:16,242
...it is just your imagination.

811
01:55:17,002 --> 01:55:18,002
Imagination?

812
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,320
Sir...

813
01:56:41,499 --> 01:56:42,413
Sir...

814
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:49,520
Sir, you've come.

815
01:56:56,944 --> 01:57:00,687
Mistake is all mine.
Punish me as you wish.

816
01:57:01,362 --> 01:57:02,362
What have you done?

817
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:06,676
Bir Singh told me you met with an
accident and are at the palace.

818
01:57:06,902 --> 01:57:10,410
There I took Madhu and she
was caught in Rajasaheb's trap.

819
01:57:10,557 --> 01:57:11,886
But Rajasaheb was not there.

820
01:57:13,064 --> 01:57:18,110
I have come to know, it was 
all a lie. It was all a plan.

821
01:57:18,347 --> 01:57:20,069
In reality,
he didn't go there at all.

822
01:57:26,493 --> 01:57:30,614
Sir... don't go. Don't go alone.

823
01:57:31,526 --> 01:57:41,458
Your heart cannot equal mine...

824
01:57:42,394 --> 01:57:54,269
That cannot be a glass,
and this cannot be a stone.

825
01:57:54,729 --> 01:58:02,963
Whether you listen or not,
I will speak my heart.

826
01:58:03,013 --> 01:58:10,146
Whether you listen or not,
I will speak my heart.

827
01:58:10,277 --> 01:58:17,753
Whether you listen or not, 
I will repeat it 100 times.

828
01:58:17,965 --> 01:58:25,136
Whether you listen or not,
I will speak my heart.

829
01:58:38,649 --> 01:58:42,281
Where is Madhu?
- Madhu? How would I know?

830
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:43,970
Get out of here.

831
01:58:46,188 --> 01:58:48,364
You scoundrel! Swine!

832
01:58:49,308 --> 01:58:51,973
I know what hunt you were on.

833
01:58:52,810 --> 01:58:55,735
You have outraged the 
modesty of an innocent.

834
01:58:56,158 --> 01:58:57,305
Tell me, where is she?

835
01:59:00,075 --> 01:59:02,852
I will kill you.
Tell me where is she?

836
01:59:03,222 --> 01:59:03,894
Tell me.

837
01:59:04,019 --> 01:59:05,402
Bir Singh.

838
01:59:10,763 --> 01:59:12,313
Tell me where is she.

839
01:59:18,738 --> 01:59:21,840
Tell me where is she?

840
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:30,424
Take him away. Hit him 
and break all his bones.

841
01:59:57,854 --> 02:00:01,760
Bir Singh, throw his 
body outside our area.

842
02:00:02,073 --> 02:00:02,987
Okay, sir.

843
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:24,890
Stop you scoundrel.

844
02:00:34,848 --> 02:00:36,644
Move aside let me go.

845
02:00:36,873 --> 02:00:38,525
Where are you taking our sir?

846
02:00:38,819 --> 02:00:42,414
Get out of my way.
- And I say, get down!

847
02:00:44,417 --> 02:00:50,402
You wagging mongrel, I have to 
settle several scores with you.

848
02:00:50,577 --> 02:00:52,336
Get down!

849
02:01:18,918 --> 02:01:21,817
I will teach you a lesson!

850
02:01:35,116 --> 02:01:36,620
Where are you taking the cart?

851
02:01:54,169 --> 02:01:55,169
Take this beating.

852
02:01:56,847 --> 02:01:57,730
Take this too.

853
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,570
And this for my Madhu.

854
02:02:01,843 --> 02:02:03,193
And this for Sir.

855
02:03:12,015 --> 02:03:13,215
What happened?

856
02:03:16,481 --> 02:03:17,494
It didn't come!

857
02:03:17,628 --> 02:03:18,823
Who didn't it come?

858
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:24,884
Was to come, but didn't.
- What is the problem?

859
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:28,885
I was with Sir the whole 
night, but his condition...

860
02:03:28,926 --> 02:03:30,120
...hasn't improved.

861
02:03:30,498 --> 02:03:32,848
Tea is ready, take it. - Ok.

862
02:03:37,794 --> 02:03:43,183
Careful. Take it carefully.

863
02:03:50,892 --> 02:03:55,683
You can go from my eyes,
but not from my heart.

864
02:03:57,385 --> 02:03:59,612
I will finally get to you.

865
02:04:05,838 --> 02:04:06,838
What happened?

866
02:04:06,891 --> 02:04:07,891
Problem.

867
02:04:08,546 --> 02:04:11,941
Sir has gone out of his mind,
and I too may get the notice.

868
02:04:12,032 --> 02:04:12,595
How?

869
02:04:12,877 --> 02:04:17,567
When I went in, he was talking 
on his own with someone.

870
02:04:17,786 --> 02:04:19,199
Don't know what happened?

871
02:04:20,450 --> 02:04:23,993
I know what has happened. 
- Tell me.

872
02:04:24,245 --> 02:04:27,526
Should I tell? - Tell me or...

873
02:04:28,124 --> 02:04:31,899
Ghost, not on you, 
but on your sir.

874
02:04:32,352 --> 02:04:34,720
On Sir, ok, then what we will do.

875
02:04:35,678 --> 02:04:40,349
First give me a cigarette.
- Have 2 but tell fast.

876
02:04:40,763 --> 02:04:44,411
There is a man,
he has removed many ghosts.

877
02:04:44,725 --> 02:04:46,474
Let us go to him.
- Come on!

878
02:04:46,515 --> 02:04:49,894
He is very scary.
I hope you won't get scared.

879
02:04:50,286 --> 02:04:56,412
Fear! I don't know what it means.

880
02:04:56,531 --> 02:05:00,808
If you feel scared...
get behind me, come along.

881
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:06,260
Here you take the lead,
later I will come forward.

882
02:05:07,224 --> 02:05:08,099
Come, come.

883
02:05:26,347 --> 02:05:27,489
Come inside.

884
02:05:39,525 --> 02:05:41,101
Don't sit here!

885
02:05:42,686 --> 02:05:44,372
Someone else is sitting here.

886
02:05:45,361 --> 02:05:46,361
There is nobody!

887
02:05:46,795 --> 02:05:50,085
Don't ever do it again.
Touch your ears!

888
02:05:50,939 --> 02:05:57,296
Get up. Sit. Get up. Sit. Go.

889
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:02,217
You will not go?
I say go peacefully...

890
02:06:02,806 --> 02:06:07,672
...or else, I will finish you!
How dare you!

891
02:06:07,945 --> 02:06:10,375
OK, then take this...

892
02:06:14,916 --> 02:06:17,084
it is strange -Go!

893
02:06:17,883 --> 02:06:20,812
Why have you halted 
behind him. Go!

894
02:06:21,019 --> 02:06:25,531
Sit down. What is the matter?

895
02:06:25,882 --> 02:06:29,449
His boss has a small
ghost troubling him.

896
02:06:29,573 --> 02:06:33,328
Then what should I do.
I don't bother for small ghosts.

897
02:06:33,385 --> 02:06:39,382
It is not a small ghost, but 
a female ghost, very deadly.

898
02:06:39,423 --> 02:06:42,507
If she is deadly, I am her son!
- Son or father?

899
02:06:42,570 --> 02:06:46,792
Ok, father then. Let us see
how she will not go. Let us go.

900
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:50,167
Your skull? - Take it along also.

901
02:07:08,129 --> 02:07:11,520
Go and call your sir.
- Sir or his ghost?

902
02:07:11,681 --> 02:07:12,867
Your boss!

903
02:07:19,859 --> 02:07:25,101
Sir... nothing.

904
02:07:29,913 --> 02:07:32,229
Really? Then close the door.

905
02:07:36,570 --> 02:07:41,276
I will say such a Mantra, what 
ghost, its father will run away!

906
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,610
A bit louder, Baba.

907
02:07:49,303 --> 02:07:50,555
Louder!

908
02:07:54,367 --> 02:08:02,869
He is going. See he is going. 
Now he has halted.

909
02:08:03,253 --> 02:08:06,201
He says give Rs 1 .25.
Or else will not go.

910
02:08:06,373 --> 02:08:09,805
Do one thing.
Tell him to go for Rs.1 only.

911
02:08:10,517 --> 02:08:12,614
If he troubles you
again don't blame me.

912
02:08:12,742 --> 02:08:16,308
I don't think he will bother
for 4 annas. - That I don't know.

913
02:08:16,361 --> 02:08:18,197
Hey, Where did Sir went?

914
02:08:18,386 --> 02:08:21,007
Look with the ghost the
man has also disappeared.

915
02:08:21,170 --> 02:08:24,408
You only said chant a bit louder.

916
02:08:24,623 --> 02:08:27,669
Hadn't I said my 
medicine is quite powerful.

917
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:32,434
Tell me where is my boss, or 
else I will break your head.

918
02:08:33,266 --> 02:08:35,551
The window is open, he 
has run away from there.

919
02:08:37,847 --> 02:08:42,488
He has become a cat! 
- My god, a cat!

920
02:08:44,058 --> 02:08:47,917
Wait. I am not leave you. Wait.

921
02:09:42,580 --> 02:09:46,761
Where were you, Madhu? I have 
been looking for you all over.

922
02:09:48,226 --> 02:09:52,980
Why are you looking at me 
like that. Come near me, Madhu.

923
02:09:55,261 --> 02:09:55,878
Madhu.

924
02:09:58,417 --> 02:10:01,222
Brother. - Madhu.

925
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:05,837
Isn't it Madhavi's voice?
- I hope she is not in any problem.

926
02:10:05,878 --> 02:10:08,174
Brother. - Where is my gun?

927
02:10:08,228 --> 02:10:10,034
You look this side.

928
02:10:11,122 --> 02:10:12,823
Madhavi, where are you?

929
02:10:15,026 --> 02:10:16,206
Madhu!

930
02:10:18,034 --> 02:10:19,136
Brother!

931
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,996
Brother. - Madhavi.

932
02:10:23,924 --> 02:10:24,721
Madhu.

933
02:10:26,706 --> 02:10:28,073
Why are you running
away from me, Madhu.

934
02:10:28,673 --> 02:10:31,339
I am not Madhu.
- Don't say that, Madhu.

935
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:35,479
Say you have forgotten me.
Perhaps you don't love me any more.

936
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:37,837
Let me go.

937
02:10:37,878 --> 02:10:38,769
Let me go.

938
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:40,261
Madhu!
- Brother.

939
02:10:40,904 --> 02:10:43,891
How dare you insult a lone woman?

940
02:10:46,225 --> 02:10:49,051
I am not insulting anyone.
I am only calling Madhu.

941
02:10:49,092 --> 02:10:51,737
Who Madhu. 
She is my sister Madhavi.

942
02:10:51,845 --> 02:10:55,628
You are lying.
Can't I recognise my Madhu?

943
02:10:56,274 --> 02:10:59,964
Behave yourself, don't you have 
any shame, trying to touch her?

944
02:11:00,207 --> 02:11:01,144
What is your name?

945
02:11:01,397 --> 02:11:06,126
My name is Anand.
- Hey, get going from here. Go.

946
02:11:06,455 --> 02:11:08,887
You haven't gone as yet.
Don't you know him?

947
02:11:08,979 --> 02:11:12,597
He is the police captain of this
area. And I am his brother in law.

948
02:11:12,826 --> 02:11:13,826
You know!

949
02:11:14,494 --> 02:11:17,189
Where do you stay?
- At the Dak Bungalow.

950
02:11:17,493 --> 02:11:20,894
Come let us go. The complete
picnic fun has gone awry.

951
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:24,167
Ruined the mood of
today picnic, come Ramesh Sir.

952
02:11:25,211 --> 02:11:27,331
Come Madhavi.

953
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:38,299
He was sitting here,
making a drawing.

954
02:11:43,482 --> 02:11:45,434
Ok, ignore it now.

955
02:11:46,885 --> 02:11:48,789
Look.

956
02:11:49,077 --> 02:11:53,443
Yes, it is strange. 
This picture resembles you totally.

957
02:11:55,397 --> 02:11:57,658
But he had never seen me before.

958
02:11:58,796 --> 02:12:01,104
Can there be any one else like me?

959
02:12:01,278 --> 02:12:04,625
It has happened at times that
two unrelated people have such...

960
02:12:04,690 --> 02:12:09,963
...similar faces, that we
police people also get confused.

961
02:12:11,252 --> 02:12:15,843
Then he was not lying.
He must get this picture back.

962
02:12:16,547 --> 02:12:17,492
Poor?

963
02:12:33,636 --> 02:12:42,211
Broken dreams have taught me...

964
02:12:42,615 --> 02:12:52,992
What the heart had gained,
has been lost by the eyes.

965
02:12:53,617 --> 02:13:02,059
Broken dreams have taught me...

966
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:12,834
What the heart had gained,
have been lost by the eyes.

967
02:13:13,266 --> 02:13:17,038
The broken dreams...

968
02:13:30,891 --> 02:13:47,917
We search for those, who on 
meeting once do not meet later.

969
02:13:48,261 --> 02:14:00,442
Why are they annoyed, those 
who are now set in my heart.

970
02:14:01,356 --> 02:14:09,400
What was I seeking, and 
what has come to the fore.

971
02:14:10,035 --> 02:14:20,114
What the heart had gained,
have been lost by the eyes.

972
02:14:20,766 --> 02:14:28,908
Broken dreams have taught me...

973
02:14:29,450 --> 02:14:39,404
That what the heart gained,
have been lost by the eyes.

974
02:14:40,114 --> 02:14:44,185
The broken dreams...

975
02:14:57,395 --> 02:15:05,976
My appeals returned,
after striking the stars.

976
02:15:06,057 --> 02:15:14,429
My appeals returned,
after striking the stars.

977
02:15:14,693 --> 02:15:26,934
It returned from all corners
of devastated world of mine.

978
02:15:27,677 --> 02:15:35,803
But all this sorrow,
has been of no use...

979
02:15:36,214 --> 02:15:46,295
That what the heart gained,
have been lost by the eyes.

980
02:15:46,852 --> 02:15:51,520
The broken dreams...

981
02:16:23,045 --> 02:16:25,182
Does anyone by the
name of Anand stay here?

982
02:16:25,311 --> 02:16:29,165
What to say, he does and
also does not. I can't understand.

983
02:16:30,028 --> 02:16:34,149
I just make his food,
which I have to eat.

984
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:39,534
Neither he or his servant is here.
Wait inside, one of them...

985
02:16:39,574 --> 02:16:42,706
...should be coming very soon.
Please sit inside.

986
02:16:50,855 --> 02:16:51,636
I am sorry.

987
02:16:54,190 --> 02:16:54,909
Listen.

988
02:16:54,994 --> 02:16:56,841
Don't talk to me.
- Why?

989
02:16:57,009 --> 02:16:58,444
You deprived thief!

990
02:16:58,560 --> 02:16:59,560
That must be your father!

991
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:01,510
And your grandfather, great grand
father and all your fore fathers.

992
02:17:01,737 --> 02:17:03,331
Yesterday you let me down!

993
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:05,944
Telling me about your Ghost removers.

994
02:17:06,107 --> 02:17:09,864
Show me the ghost, brink him in front of
me, or else I'll bring my you the ghost.

995
02:17:15,029 --> 02:17:17,622
Hello, What happened?

996
02:17:21,341 --> 02:17:22,052
Listen..

997
02:17:25,267 --> 02:17:30,323
Please forgive me, it was 
not my fault. Forgive me.

998
02:17:30,490 --> 02:17:33,904
I am scared of ghosts.
Forgive me, Madhu.

999
02:17:34,551 --> 02:17:36,383
I am not Madhu, but Madhavi.

1000
02:17:37,402 --> 02:17:40,925
Madhavi? Really?

1001
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:50,356
Let me touch and confirm.
Yes! Same nose, same features.

1002
02:17:50,520 --> 02:17:57,059
...same eyes. So it is you, 
he mistook for Madhu.

1003
02:17:58,277 --> 02:18:03,797
Just tell me, who is Madhu?
What happened to her?

1004
02:18:04,465 --> 02:18:07,040
Please sit down.
I will tell you everything.

1005
02:18:20,699 --> 02:18:23,028
This is the story of this
unfortunate girl.

1006
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:28,784
I am fairly sure she is dead.
But sir doesn't believe she is dead.

1007
02:18:29,434 --> 02:18:35,149
Now I know why on the hills,
he was calling for Madhu.

1008
02:18:37,411 --> 02:18:40,750
It is dark now. I will 
light the lamp and come.

1009
02:19:09,127 --> 02:19:10,197
Sir has come!

1010
02:19:49,122 --> 02:19:51,842
If there was any one else in my 
place, he would've been misled.

1011
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:27,875
Anil sir.

1012
02:20:29,387 --> 02:20:31,954
You do not know what
injustice I have gone through.

1013
02:20:32,846 --> 02:20:36,102
I know, I have heard it all.

1014
02:20:41,575 --> 02:20:46,706
I feel as if Madhu's
sorrow has become mine.

1015
02:21:02,527 --> 02:21:04,327
Don't shed tears for me.

1016
02:21:09,652 --> 02:21:15,087
Same face, same eyes, same looks...

1017
02:21:29,705 --> 02:21:39,681
Come, my foreigner.

1018
02:21:42,417 --> 02:21:45,748
The darkness has set...

1019
02:21:46,108 --> 02:21:47,931
Are you hearing it? - What?

1020
02:21:49,497 --> 02:21:50,587
She is calling me...

1021
02:21:52,321 --> 02:21:53,558
Where are you going?

1022
02:21:54,751 --> 02:21:55,579
Madhu.

1023
02:21:59,102 --> 02:22:00,875
Madhu.

1024
02:22:03,798 --> 02:22:04,610
Madhu.

1025
02:22:09,267 --> 02:22:10,392
Madhu.

1026
02:22:11,575 --> 02:22:15,218
I stay close to you,
amongst the stars.

1027
02:22:15,927 --> 02:22:20,868
I had promised. I won, and he lost.

1028
02:22:21,352 --> 02:22:28,580
Who?- Wake up and see.
He has my blood on his hands.

1029
02:22:28,667 --> 02:22:32,156
Who has? - Ugra Narain.

1030
02:22:35,668 --> 02:22:37,894
That snake wanted to bite me.

1031
02:22:40,417 --> 02:22:42,667
Madhu, madhu.

1032
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:44,026
Anil sir.

1033
02:22:49,675 --> 02:22:51,578
I am going.
- Where?

1034
02:22:52,763 --> 02:22:55,410
His hands are red
with my Madhu's blood.

1035
02:22:56,481 --> 02:23:00,225
And that snake is still alive.
- Whom are you talking of?

1036
02:23:00,335 --> 02:23:01,435
Ugra Narain.

1037
02:23:04,933 --> 02:23:07,996
I know this Ugra Narain.
He is quite a goon.

1038
02:23:08,483 --> 02:23:10,719
Earlier too he had a hand 
in two or three murders.

1039
02:23:11,180 --> 02:23:14,580
You know it, and yet this 
dangerous animal is free!

1040
02:23:15,326 --> 02:23:17,278
Why don't you arrest 
him, Inspector?

1041
02:23:17,326 --> 02:23:19,009
I have expressed my helplessness.

1042
02:23:20,326 --> 02:23:22,681
Without proof nothing can be done.

1043
02:23:24,687 --> 02:23:27,859
Hello. Hello Kamal, yes.

1044
02:23:29,668 --> 02:23:31,842
Madhavi's dance and 
I will not come?

1045
02:23:32,438 --> 02:23:36,495
There are still 15 minutes left.
I am reaching there straight away.

1046
02:23:37,002 --> 02:23:38,877
Yes, okay. See you.

1047
02:23:41,426 --> 02:23:43,970
Ok, if you don't have time,
I will take leave.

1048
02:23:44,922 --> 02:23:49,269
Wait. Leave the pistol here.
Bring it here.

1049
02:23:50,912 --> 02:23:53,256
Give me the pistol for just 2 days.

1050
02:23:53,865 --> 02:23:57,843
I will kill that sinner.
Later you can hang me.

1051
02:23:58,174 --> 02:24:02,499
My revenge will be complete.
- Don't be rash, keep the pistol.

1052
02:24:07,426 --> 02:24:13,294
Listen, if you want Madhu's
murderer punished, then produce...

1053
02:24:13,677 --> 02:24:17,427
...some solid proofs.
I assure you I will help you.

1054
02:24:19,710 --> 02:24:21,758
Where are you going? 
- I don't know.

1055
02:24:22,562 --> 02:24:24,094
Come with me. - Where?

1056
02:24:24,296 --> 02:24:25,296
Just come.

1057
02:24:41,056 --> 02:24:41,751
Hello.

1058
02:24:42,141 --> 02:24:45,254
Hello Inspector, you 
took quite some time.

1059
02:24:45,632 --> 02:24:47,915
Yes, some office matters
and we got delayed.

1060
02:26:01,346 --> 02:26:08,168
Oh, the scorpion!

1061
02:26:37,489 --> 02:26:45,947
The mantras are of no use,
and so are the doctors...

1062
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:50,986
But when my lover came back...

1063
02:26:53,758 --> 02:26:58,884
if law wants proof,
then it is in front of you.

1064
02:26:59,942 --> 02:27:03,307
What are you saying Anand,
I haven't understood you.

1065
02:27:03,996 --> 02:27:13,783
If Madhavi appears in the 
garb of Madhu, like me...

1066
02:27:14,724 --> 02:27:18,161
...he too will think
Madhu has returned.

1067
02:27:18,511 --> 02:27:20,277
Then what will happen, Anand?

1068
02:27:20,633 --> 02:27:23,499
That coward will break
down in such a situation.

1069
02:27:23,635 --> 02:27:27,580
He will admit his crime,
and seek forgivance.

1070
02:27:29,309 --> 02:27:35,861
Madhavi, I request 
you, please help me.

1071
02:27:38,452 --> 02:27:39,452
Brother!

1072
02:27:42,072 --> 02:27:43,548
Then when do we act, Anand?

1073
02:27:43,769 --> 02:27:46,603
That I will return and tell you.

1074
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:51,985
Inspector, are you with me?

1075
02:27:52,277 --> 02:27:54,676
To be with you is 
the duty of Law.

1076
02:27:55,096 --> 02:27:59,631
I will not forget your favor
till my death. I'll take leave.

1077
02:29:07,566 --> 02:29:10,760
You are sitting here?
- What are you doing here?

1078
02:29:12,316 --> 02:29:14,886
To apologise to you. - For what?

1079
02:29:16,558 --> 02:29:22,621
In youth, one makes many
mistakes and I did the same.

1080
02:29:23,516 --> 02:29:25,155
Tell me clearly, 
what do you want!

1081
02:29:26,220 --> 02:29:29,399
For Madhumati, I unnecessarily 
fought with you.

1082
02:29:30,183 --> 02:29:33,452
The result you see in front of you.
I have nothing to eat or wear.

1083
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:35,621
I am fed up of life.

1084
02:29:36,164 --> 02:29:38,125
If you are fed up,
why have you come here?

1085
02:29:39,361 --> 02:29:42,062
If you help me, I will return home.

1086
02:29:45,584 --> 02:29:50,160
No I do not want money for free.
I will work for it.

1087
02:29:50,697 --> 02:29:52,312
You are still very proud.

1088
02:29:52,954 --> 02:29:55,535
If my pride was still there,
I wouldn't have come to you.

1089
02:29:56,301 --> 02:30:01,117
You know I make portraits,
I will make a portrait of you.

1090
02:30:02,666 --> 02:30:07,198
Your hobby of making pictures is
still there, but I don't have time.

1091
02:30:11,491 --> 02:30:17,741
I might not live to
come again Please help me.

1092
02:30:18,719 --> 02:30:22,463
I don't have time. - I will
come at whatever time you say.

1093
02:30:24,333 --> 02:30:26,671
Ok, you come tomorrow at
around 6 or 6:30 in the evening.

1094
02:30:28,078 --> 02:30:32,835
Thank you very much,
I will take leave.

1095
02:30:42,202 --> 02:30:46,352
Here, take this. Come tomorrow
at 8:OO in the evening to palace.

1096
02:30:48,099 --> 02:30:49,299
You will come?

1097
02:30:52,557 --> 02:30:55,357
This dress is exactly
like the one she wore...

1098
02:30:55,398 --> 02:30:57,167
...on that night.

1099
02:30:57,876 --> 02:31:02,658
Sir, you will come with
her tomorrow night? - Yes.

1100
02:31:02,896 --> 02:31:03,984
Ok, then I will make a move.

1101
02:31:04,108 --> 02:31:07,280
You have just come, have a cup 
of tea. Madhavi, a cup of tea.

1102
02:31:07,321 --> 02:31:12,854
No, no. Don't take the trouble.
I have a lot to do.

1103
02:31:13,774 --> 02:31:15,429
I can't stay for a minute.

1104
02:31:15,820 --> 02:31:19,007
But tomorrow, at 8 sharp.
Will you remember.

1105
02:31:19,351 --> 02:31:20,849
Yes, tomorrow, at 8 sharp.

1106
02:31:24,465 --> 02:31:25,465
Poor chap.

1107
02:31:37,414 --> 02:31:42,249
First I will go, all arrangements 
have been done. - Ok.

1108
02:32:10,692 --> 02:32:12,044
What a dreadful night!

1109
02:32:13,585 --> 02:32:15,457
You have come here to talk,
or to make a portrait!

1110
02:32:15,877 --> 02:32:17,349
Do your work.

1111
02:32:27,457 --> 02:32:30,248
Behind you! Whose shadow is that?

1112
02:32:36,598 --> 02:32:38,604
It is nothing, just the 
shadow of the curtain.

1113
02:32:41,058 --> 02:32:45,418
Did you try and scare me?
- I am myself scared.

1114
02:32:45,707 --> 02:32:47,938
I don't have time to waste.
What's the time?

1115
02:32:49,414 --> 02:32:51,874
There isn't much time 
left for 8 o'clock.

1116
02:32:52,053 --> 02:32:53,353
Go do your work.

1117
02:32:54,942 --> 02:32:55,605
Okay.

1118
02:32:58,845 --> 02:33:01,681
Rajasaheb, blood! - Blood?

1119
02:33:08,730 --> 02:33:09,930
Yes. See here!

1120
02:33:12,877 --> 02:33:15,687
There are blood spots which've
come up on your picture.

1121
02:33:16,458 --> 02:33:17,722
This must be your handiwork.

1122
02:33:17,806 --> 02:33:21,137
No, Rajasaheb, there is 
someone else's hand in it.

1123
02:33:21,498 --> 02:33:25,758
But besides us, there 
is no one else here.

1124
02:33:26,419 --> 02:33:31,520
There is somebody else here.
I can feel it. Did you hear it?

1125
02:33:31,994 --> 02:33:36,710
As if some one is softly entering.
Can you hear it?

1126
02:33:36,760 --> 02:33:38,534
No, I am not hearing anything.

1127
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:40,939
Rub out those spots.

1128
02:34:07,758 --> 02:34:10,666
Are you afraid, Rajasaheb?
- Of course not!

1129
02:34:16,198 --> 02:34:17,610
What are you staring at me for?

1130
02:34:18,019 --> 02:34:19,712
What ever the artist sees.

1131
02:34:20,556 --> 02:34:24,619
What is inside,
he wants to portray that.

1132
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:28,129
Rajasaheb, do you 
believe in spirits?

1133
02:34:28,315 --> 02:34:29,715
Why do you ask such a question?

1134
02:34:30,097 --> 02:34:34,648
The night is like that.
It appears some spirit...

1135
02:34:34,689 --> 02:34:39,786
...whose dreams are incomplete
is trying to enter here.

1136
02:34:42,091 --> 02:34:49,336
Those shadows, those 
terrifying sobs...- Enough!

1137
02:34:58,940 --> 02:35:02,199
Close the window!

1138
02:35:19,772 --> 02:35:21,205
Those footsteps!

1139
02:35:29,264 --> 02:35:31,995
Who is that? Anand, lights!

1140
02:35:54,192 --> 02:36:00,253
Don't come a step forward.
Go away from here. Get out.

1141
02:36:00,824 --> 02:36:02,676
Anand, tell her to 
get out of here.

1142
02:36:05,315 --> 02:36:09,722
Why should you be scared today.
Do you remember that stormy night?

1143
02:36:10,848 --> 02:36:15,777
You brought
me here on some false pretext!

1144
02:36:16,688 --> 02:36:21,329
What happened after that?
Speak, what happened?

1145
02:36:23,785 --> 02:36:24,785
Why are you quiet?

1146
02:36:25,789 --> 02:36:29,275
Halt, I will tell everything.

1147
02:36:30,151 --> 02:36:32,800
You came crying for sir,
into my room...

1148
02:36:34,012 --> 02:36:35,841
I tried to get hold of you.

1149
02:36:36,533 --> 02:36:41,178
But you slipped my hold and 
ran away. I followed you...

1150
02:37:21,861 --> 02:37:26,205
Halt there, if you come forward,
I will jump down from here.

1151
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:30,033
You will never be able to get 
peace after killing an innocent.

1152
02:37:56,551 --> 02:38:00,133
Then you buried my body
near the stream...

1153
02:38:00,442 --> 02:38:04,904
...so that nobody will know.
- Yes, I had killed you.

1154
02:38:05,301 --> 02:38:07,135
And today I will kill you again.

1155
02:38:10,289 --> 02:38:12,963
Some body here? Lights, lights.

1156
02:38:18,487 --> 02:38:20,952
You are under arrest.
- All this is false.

1157
02:38:20,993 --> 02:38:24,797
I have heard all and you
just admitted to the murder.

1158
02:38:25,459 --> 02:38:27,532
Any clarifications you have,
you can give in the court.

1159
02:38:27,573 --> 02:38:28,769
Constable!

1160
02:38:31,929 --> 02:38:33,079
Take the gun.

1161
02:38:41,508 --> 02:38:47,345
That sinner will get punishment
for his crime, but so what?

1162
02:38:49,603 --> 02:38:51,064
But so what?

1163
02:38:53,654 --> 02:39:00,287
My peace will never return.
My peace can never return, Madhavi.

1164
02:39:05,513 --> 02:39:09,955
I am grateful to you.
Because of you...

1165
02:39:16,707 --> 02:39:18,720
But how did you know
all these things...

1166
02:39:20,973 --> 02:39:24,042
How did you know all those
things which I too didn't know.

1167
02:39:26,163 --> 02:39:30,505
After reaching this place, how did
you know what happened to Madhu?

1168
02:39:32,783 --> 02:39:35,135
Why are you smiling?

1169
02:39:36,852 --> 02:39:38,752
Why that strange
brightness in your eyes.

1170
02:39:39,733 --> 02:39:41,303
Where are you going Madhavi?

1171
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:47,693
Brother, it is 8 o'clock.
I will go running.

1172
02:39:49,883 --> 02:39:53,529
Why are you quiet,
answer my questions.

1173
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:55,765
Anil sir. Anil sir.

1174
02:39:57,577 --> 02:40:02,444
Sorry, I am late.
The car broke down on the way.

1175
02:40:05,133 --> 02:40:05,945
Madhu?

1176
02:40:06,979 --> 02:40:08,141
What happened?

1177
02:40:14,888 --> 02:40:17,483
Madhu had come. - Who?

1178
02:40:17,836 --> 02:40:20,726
Madhu. - But where is she?

1179
02:40:20,868 --> 02:40:21,657
Sir.

1180
02:40:22,267 --> 02:40:26,220
Heard it? She is calling me.

1181
02:40:26,571 --> 02:40:27,438
Sir.

1182
02:40:28,213 --> 02:40:29,414
She is calling me.

1183
02:40:30,476 --> 02:40:32,461
Anil sir. Anil sir.

1184
02:40:32,812 --> 02:40:33,883
Madhvi?

1185
02:40:34,789 --> 02:40:35,984
Sir.

1186
02:40:38,070 --> 02:40:40,039
Anil sir.

1187
02:40:42,242 --> 02:40:43,335
Madhu?

1188
02:40:48,365 --> 02:40:49,264
Sir.

1189
02:40:51,185 --> 02:40:53,279
Anil sir.

1190
02:40:54,498 --> 02:40:55,381
Madhu?

1191
02:40:55,802 --> 02:41:03,934
Come. Since long, I have 
been waiting for you.

1192
02:41:04,095 --> 02:41:10,740
My eyes are tired waiting...

1193
02:41:11,304 --> 02:41:21,789
Come, my foreigner!

1194
02:41:29,489 --> 02:41:32,346
And that is how my
last birth came to an end.

1195
02:41:33,161 --> 02:41:36,732
I did not get Madhu in that life.
At the time of death...

1196
02:41:36,773 --> 02:41:38,935
I had only one wish. One wish.

1197
02:41:40,212 --> 02:41:42,966
That in my next birth,
I'll get her back.

1198
02:41:44,373 --> 02:41:48,904
And in this life I have found 
her, Doctor! - Who? Radha?

1199
02:41:49,268 --> 02:41:58,318
Yes. Crossing death, we were 
born again. And we met again.

1200
02:42:00,879 --> 02:42:04,373
It is morning!
There is no sign of the driver.

1201
02:42:04,899 --> 02:42:07,586
Radha must have had a harrowing
time at the station waiting for us.

1202
02:42:07,764 --> 02:42:08,639
Sir.. Sir..

1203
02:42:08,680 --> 02:42:10,982
Has the road opened?
- Yes, it is open, but...

1204
02:42:11,023 --> 02:42:13,392
...there is some bad news.
The train in which Radha...

1205
02:42:13,433 --> 02:42:15,533
...was travelling has met with 
an accident. Many are injured.

1206
02:42:15,824 --> 02:42:16,650
How have you come to know?

1207
02:42:16,691 --> 02:42:18,422
People coming from
below are saying so.

1208
02:42:19,461 --> 02:42:21,611
It cannot happen! Come, doctor.

1209
02:43:07,017 --> 02:43:07,783
Radha.

1210
02:43:08,556 --> 02:43:10,767
Thank you, for coming back.

1211
02:43:11,535 --> 02:43:13,970
For a moment, I almost died.

1212
02:43:17,576 --> 02:43:19,964
It appears I have 
found you again.

1213
02:43:22,069 --> 02:43:26,314
Do you know, we are 
partners of several births!

1214
02:43:32,064 --> 02:43:34,064
Oops! I had forgotten!
