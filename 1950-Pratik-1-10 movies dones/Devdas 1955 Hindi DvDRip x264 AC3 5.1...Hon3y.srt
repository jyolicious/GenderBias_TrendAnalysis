We'll eat raw mangoes.

00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,499
"Devdas is running away, sir.
- Devdas! Where are you going?"

7
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,233
"Come here, you rascal.
Once you go, you never return."

8
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,507
Your father may be a rich man.
In fact he only ordered...

9
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,912
that you stay behind to study.
Bholu! What the hell do you do?

10
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,242
"Listen carefully. If he gives me
the slip, you'll have it!"

11
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,585
"Now, give him some sums."

12
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,187
"Here, do these sums.
- Go and sit there."

13
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:04,105
I can't do these.
- Show me.

14
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,515
"If the cost of oil
is Rs.14.65, then..."

15
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,254
then this!

16
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,221
What happened? Where's Devdas?
- Sir...

17
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,221
Catch him!

18
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,876
You've spoilt my lime-powder.
- Wasn't my fault.

19
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,882
"He pushed me, and ran off.
- Pushed you and ran off?"

20
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,209
And you couldn't even stop him?
Hey! What are you laughing at?

21
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,885
Where has he gone?

22
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,620
We couldn't catch him.
- Why?

23
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,485
He threw stones at us.
- He hit me with one over here.

24
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,228
Blood!
- He broke your head?

25
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,297
Let's all go to his father.

26
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:00,264
Let him see his son's deeds.
He'll not attend school anymore!

27
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:04,502
"Come Bholu! What's this?
Pocketing my lime-powder, eh?"

28
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,502
Not my fault.
- Empty your pocket... go on!

29
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,008
Don't wipe your face as yet.
We've to show his father.

30
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:26,192
Will Devdas be really rusticated?
- Can't say with this silly teacher.

31
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,260
I don't feel like attending myself!
Come.

32
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:38,202
"Now you tell me what to do, sir.
- It's a problem. My son?"

33
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:41,538
"If the fence starts to eat
the grass, who'll guard it?"

34
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,937
Where is he?
- I don't know.

35
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,116
"When kids chased him, he..."

36
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:49,220
"Where's that boy? Come here.
Look for yourself, Sir."

37
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:57,495
"Get Deva from wherever he is!
Don't worry, master."

38
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:03,291
Everybody is equal to me.
Deva will not be spared.

39
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,303
"Come on, boys..."

40
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,109
Why are you by yourself today?

41
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,509
Where's Deva?
- He ran away.

42
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:24,515
What do you mean?
- That chap fell in the lime-powder.

43
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,521
Have you seen Bho
u's face?
Looks like a white washed house!

44
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,918
"Will you just giggle, or explain?"

45
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,531
Tell me where Deva is.
- I don't know.

46
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,867
You know alright. Tell me.
He must be hungry.

47
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,398
Sure.

48
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,096
But I won't tell you because
he'll hit me it I do.

49
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:46,870
"I'll take some food for him.
- Do that, but listen..."

50
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,204
Coax him and bring him
home by evening.

51
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,872
Alright. I'll get him.

52
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,485
"Do you know what happened
in school today, Father?"

53
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,494
Silly! What happened?
- I'm very hungry.

54
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,436
I'll eat something and then tell you.
- Okay.

55
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,097
"Mummy, I'm famished.
Give me something to eat."

56
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:28,453
ls that all? It's not enough.
- This is your daily quota.

57
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,355
Why extra today?
- Give her. It's nothing heavy.

58
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:36,191
Just puffed-rice.
Give my darling girl some more.

59
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,855
Happy?

60
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,549
Who's there?

61
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,451
<i>“R's you, Faro. Come.“</i>

62
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,228
"Smoking tobacco again, eh?
- So what? All men do it."

63
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,829
"Get something to bite, eh?
Good!"

64
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,496
What did our teacher do?

65
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,977
He went and reported
to your father.

66
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:32,341
He told my father? Then?
- He won't let you attend school.

67
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,286
Never mind. I never wanted to
study anyway. Give me sweets.

68
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,522
I didn't bring any.

69
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,852
Get water.
- From where will I get it?

70
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,859
"No sweets, no water...
What the hell! Go get water!"

71
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,587
"l won't go, because you'll
run away from here."

72
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,431
I won't. Go.

73
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,865
"No...
- No? Go, I say!"

74
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:02,870
I'll go and tell everything
to your father!

75
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,882
Listen Paro...
Get lost!

76
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,061
"I looked everywhere, father.
No sign of him."

77
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,889
Where can he be?

78
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,235
"Why are you crying, dear?
- Deva hit me!"

79
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,627
Where is he?
- In the orchard.

80
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,033
Do you know? he smokes
tobacco on the sly too.

81
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:35,577
What! He smokes also now?
Calamity indeed. Bad times ahead.

82
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,278
"No school or food for him from now.
Devidas, go this moment..."

83
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:43,181
and get him here somehow!
Pernicious! Bane to the family!

84
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,467
Catch him! Stop him!

85
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,602
Can't you see?
- Catch him!

86
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,868
Come along!

87
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,147
"Run away from school, eh?
Pick fights too. Rascal!"

88
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,223
Stop it!
You've beaten him enough. Stop!

89
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,322
"Thrash him verbally,
but don't kill him!"

90
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,562
Shut up.

91
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,561
Your leniency has spoilt him!
Nobody dare open this door.

92
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,092
And no food him either!

93
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,035
Come and eat your food.

94
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,076
No!
- Come son.

95
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:53,914
"Paro, your food's getting cold.
- I won't eat. I've a tummy-ache."

96
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,570
<i>“Come here, Pam.“</i>

97
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,526
Why did you tell him I smoked?
- Why did you hit me?

98
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,293
Why didn't you get water?
- Why do you scold me?

99
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,587
Silly!

100
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,194
Now don't squeal on me again.

101
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,867
Then don't hit me again.
- I won't.

102
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,207
"You mean you have forgiven me?
- Yes, want it in writing?"

103
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,537
Let's go to Rambabu's garden.

104
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,870
I'll get you a baby-bird.
- Come...

105
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,894
Keep this money with you.

106
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,853
"Dear wonderful bird,
your place is far away"

107
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:16,190
"Once you leave a branch
when will you return to it?"

108
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,218
"The blue sky is your swing...
- Not a swing, but a courtyard"

109
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:46,563
"The blue sky is your courtyard
and the rainbow your swing..."

110
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,497
"in the litter of your bright
wings you fly with gay abandon"

111
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:02,243
"With a cocky walk, a heady look,
and a beautiful face to boot..."

112
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:07,841
"O, wonderful bird
your home is far away"

113
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:13,020
"Once you leave a branch
when will you return to it?"

114
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:29,871
"Come down from that branch
and listen to what I say"

115
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:37,874
"Our house is nearby.
Come and choose your grain"

116
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,321
"Today be our guest
and sing and laugh..."

117
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:49,223
"No, laugh and sing...
- Dear bird..."

118
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:53,897
"O, wonderful bird
your home is far away"

119
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:59,066
"Once you leave a branch
when do you return to it?"

120
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,845
"If you've to go, then let us
dress you up with flowers"

121
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,850
"Let us kiss your forehead,
and put bells on your feet"

122
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,461
"Then go away happily
wherever you want to go"

123
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:38,205
"Dear wonderful bird.
your destination is far away"

124
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:43,274
"Once you leave a branch.
Do you ever return to it?"

125
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,876
"O wonderful bird,
your home is far away"

126
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:05,168
"Father, a man had come weeping that
his fishing net in the water..."

127
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:10,237
was torn to pieces by Devdas.
- His pranks are getting worse!

128
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,179
I'll send him to Calcutta to your
brother. He'll he ruined here.

129
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,374
"To the city, at such a young age?
- No Mother, don't spoil it now."

130
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,411
It's for his own good.
- Okay. Do what you think right.

131
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,314
I won't interfere at all.

132
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,620
"I won't go.
- Don't cry, son."

133
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,227
I won't go to Calcutta...

134
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:43,068
I'm not happy to send you away too.
But you'll study better there.

135
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,408
Now come along.

136
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:55,212
Go and sit in the carriage.
Go on.

137
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,821
Don't cry while leaving.
I'll be there with you.

138
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,321
"And during holidays,
we'll come back here."

139
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,224
I won't go!

140
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,158
Let's see how you don't.
Get in.

141
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,842
"Coachman, let's go."

142
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,856
I'll come during the holidays.

143
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,134
"Hey, listen..."

144
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,174
"Do you know how to sing?
- Of course, why not?"

145
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,434
Then sing.

146
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,838
One doesn't sing for the heck of it.
We must be paid.

147
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,345
"Let's go to your house and sing.
- No... not at home, but here."

148
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,187
You'll have to give pennies...
- Pennies? I've just got Rupees!

149
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,393
Rupees? Come child...
Let's go under that tree there.

150
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:07,274
"Come and meet me dear Krishna...
come and meet"

151
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:15,883
"Come, clear Krishna, your Radha's
roaming all alone, looking lost"

152
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:24,359
"Roaming all alone, looking lost.
- So come Krishna, come and meet her"

153
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:43,184
"We all miss you so terribly
in Vrindavan, dear Lord..."

154
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:47,322
"We miss you so very much,..."

155
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:52,258
"The day your topic comes up,
our haunted eyes overflow"

156
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,327
"Our haunted eyes overflow..."

157
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,199
"Even now we worry in mind,
what will happen in future"

158
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:05,138
"For your Radha's roaming
all alone, looking lost"

159
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:09,344
"Radha's roaming, looking lost;
so come Krishna..."

160
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:16,251
"Come and meet, dear Krishna.
Come and meet us all"

161
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,568
"You still haven't sent us
any news about yourself"

162
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:48,247
"We still have no news from you.
- No news from you..."

163
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,920
"Every girl in Vrindavan has
gone mad crying over you"

164
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,197
"Come and console them,
show your face O Lord..."

165
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,866
"For your Radha's roaming
all alone, looking lost"

166
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:14,873
"Radha's roaming alone and lost.
- So come, dear Lord, come"

167
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:24,888
Truly lonely!
It brought tears to my eyes.

168
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:30,325
And why not? The song is profound.
One day Krishna had hidden himself.

169
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:35,229
"And when he couldn't be found,
Radha had sung this song fervently."

170
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,902
"Here, take this.
for you... and you too."

171
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:43,229
<i>Rs. 31-? Whose are they?</i>

172
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,567
Devdas's.
- Won't he get angry?

173
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:50,643
"No, he's gone to Calcutta.
You all got your money, didn't you?"

174
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,207
"Yes, my dear.
You're very generous."

175
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:58,316
"May you become a queen
to some king, my dear."

176
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,515
"Come, let's go."

177
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:15,199
From tomorrow I'll go to school
again. I feel very lonely.

178
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:20,867
"Okay, do that.
Listen, do one chore for me."

179
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:23,873
"Take this pot, and get
some water from the pond."

180
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,403
Your Devdas has come back.

181
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,345
Who told you?
- The wind!

182
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,117
"I saw him with my own eyes.
A cane in hand, watch on wrist."

183
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,148
Gold buttons chain...
He has become a real gentleman!

184
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,290
He used to come here every year
in his holidays before.

185
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:46,428
Then he came once in 2-3 years.

186
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,054
Don't know what has
brought him here this time.

187
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,223
Maybe he remembered you!

188
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:04,177
What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

189
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,522
Please plait my hair for me.

190
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,429
"It's not evening as yet,
silly girl."

191
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,138
"So what? Do it for me.
My sweet, dear Grandma."

192
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,587
I hear Devdas is here.

193
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,899
"Before, whenever he came,
he used to drop in."

194
00:25:56,422 --> 00:26:00,837
"But today, he still hasn't come.
- The city does that to you."

195
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:06,203
Man changes in every respect.
Maybe Devdas has changed too!

196
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,004
Aunty...

197
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,513
Isn't that Devdas's voice?
- Yes.

198
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:21,318
"Devdas! You look so different.
Come right in, son."

199
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:28,189
Bless you. You have a long life.
We were just talking about you.

200
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:34,198
You really look different.
- Because we're meeting after ages!

201
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:38,338
Where's Paro?
- She was just here.

202
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:40,202
Must have gone upstairs.

203
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:46,214
"Devdas is here, dear.
- Never mind. I'll go upstairs."

204
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,851
"So, how's everything?"

205
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,460
You're so grown up!

206
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,876
Okay... it's pretty late.
I'll go home.

207
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,489
"What's this? You just came,
and you're already leaving?"

208
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,155
I'm tired after the journey.
I'll come again tomorrow.

209
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,489
Okay.

210
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,929
Has Devdas gone?
- Yes.

211
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,174
He and Paro get along so well.

212
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:24,174
And why not?
They've grown up together.

213
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:28,250
"If they wed, what a lovely
couple they'll make!"

214
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:33,119
Why not approach his father?
- How is that possible?

215
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:38,119
Why build castles in air?
They're high-caste landlords.

216
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:43,125
"If caste is important, so is beauty.
Our Paro is a dazzler!"

217
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:48,128
I'll go and see Devadas's mother.
Let's see how she refuses!

218
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,317
"I think I've left the store-room
open. Go and check, clear."

219
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:11,361
<i>Pam's grandma spoke to me
about Faro‘ s marriage.</i>

220
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,354
Naturally.
She must get married now.

221
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,532
That's why she
brought up the topic.

222
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:19,826
She said if Devdas...
- And what did you reply?

223
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:25,404
"Me? I refused outright.
- Good, they are not of our level."

224
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,511
Then to have them next-door...
Don't get influenced by them.

225
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:53,923
You really can't see
where you're going!

226
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:04,067
"Mother, who asked you to approach
Devdas's mother for Paro's hand?"

227
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,309
You could've talked to me first.
Landlords! Of higher caste!

228
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:14,317
I would've never approached anyway!
We needn't beg to get her married.

229
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,546
People will beg for her instead!
Why are you worried?

230
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,878
"I can't help it, son.
- Stop it!"

231
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,547
You think nobody has approached.

232
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,259
I've got 6 proposals for her!
See if I don't get her married...

233
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:27,896
to a bigger landlord than
our neighbours here!

234
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:33,465
"I'll fix everything within a week.
In fact, I'll go right now!"

235
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,462
"Where are you going, Paro?
- To get some water."

236
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,139
Just give me the chillies
I've put out to dry in the sun.

237
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,890
"Why have you stopped here, Paro?
- Just like that."

238
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,901
"Tell me, how old is the groom?"

239
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,914
"Whose groom?
- Yours, of course."

240
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,849
About 23-24 yrs. old.
- What! I heard he's over 40!

241
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:07,196
I don't know who's over 40.
I don't keep a track on everyone.

242
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:13,201
I just know that my groom will be
about 23-24 yrs. old.

243
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,202
"And, his name?"

244
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:20,467
"You know everything about me,
and not this?"

245
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:26,873
How will I know your mind?
- Oh? Then come close... closer...

246
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:33,881
Shameless girl! Don't be funny!
Tell me his name.

247
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,327
I just told you.
- But Grandma told me you're...

248
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,325
engaged to somebody from Manekpur.
- How can that be?

249
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,892
"It'll be me,
who'll get married, not grandma!"

250
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,064
"So it's all cooked from your side...
All planned in secrecy, eh?"

251
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:56,912
Nothing is cooked as yet.
- What nonsense! I don't understand.

252
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:03,285
Then I'll ask Devdas and tell you.
- Ask him what? If he'll wed you?

253
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,851
Of course!
- Just think...

254
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,457
you'll ask him yourself?
Aren't you ashamed?

255
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:14,029
Why? Did I feel ashamed
to tell you?

256
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,424
"I'm a woman, plus your friend.
But, he's a man, after all."

257
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:23,129
"True, you're a woman, and
a friend. But is he a stranger?"

258
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:27,875
"What I can tell you,
can't I tell him?"

259
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:36,046
"You're a married woman, and
don't you know what is a husband?"

260
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,885
He's my husband... my master.

261
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,887
Why should I be ashamed
in his presence?

262
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:47,085
"Manorama, somebody is here
to call you home."

263
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:49,354
"Okay Paro, I'll see you."

264
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,303
Who is it?
- It's me.

265
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,353
Yqu?

266
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,826
Have you come alone
so late at night?

267
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,334
Yes.
- Really?

268
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:12,832
Didn't you feel scared on the way?
- I'm not scared of ghosts.

269
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:20,516
"Okay, but what about men?
- I think not, at this moment."

270
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,385
How did you come in?
Did anybody see you?

271
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:36,295
The watchman saw me.
- Even the servants must've seen.

272
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,861
Maybe.

273
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:48,409
Why did you do this? Won't your
head hang in shame tomorrow?

274
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:55,881
"It would, if I didn't know,
that you'd stand up for me."

275
00:37:56,608 --> 00:38:00,556
Me? But how will I show
my face too?

276
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,823
You? Why nut?

277
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:11,828
"You're a man. If not tomorrow,
in a few days you'll be forgiven."

278
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:20,166
"Soon, nobody will remember, when,
which night, unfortunate Paro,..."

279
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:25,838
"had come to you, thinking
you were everything to her."

280
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:35,188
I was thinking of your reputation.
- Reputation? Nothing wrong with it.

281
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:42,556
If I get a bad name for having
come to you on the sly... so be it.

282
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:49,365
Hey! You're crying.
- There's so much water in the river.

283
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,537
Won't it be enough to
wash away my stigma?

284
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,866
Don't talk like that.

285
00:38:55,867 --> 00:39:00,213
I can do anything for you.
But...

286
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,417
You know my parents
are against it.

287
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:10,152
"If I marry you against their wish,
where will you be?"

288
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,827
At your feet.

289
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,166
"Give me a little
space here, master."

290
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,242
Let me see you to your house.

291
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,186
You'll come with me?
- Why not?

292
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:46,185
"If you could come, why not me?
We'll yet a bad reputation..."

293
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:50,094
So fine. We may find solution
for ourselves through it.

294
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,858
Let's go then.

295
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,349
"Neither your father,
nor brother will agree to it."

296
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,881
Why stir a hornets nest
for such a small matter.

297
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,250
For you it's a small matter.

298
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:27,893
How dare you ask such a thing?
Didn't you think of our prestige?

299
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:37,903
"Silence! Stop blabbering!
One more word, and I disown you!"

300
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,172
Get out of my sight!

301
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,928
"Where are you going, son?
- Calcutta."

302
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,400
"What! Listen,..."

303
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:23,882
He's going to Calcutta. Bring him
back. Tell him I'm calling him.

304
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,219
"Your mother's calling you.
Come back, Devdas."

305
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,400
"Listen, Devdas..."

306
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,417
I hear he's gone to Calcutta.
- Yes.

307
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,877
And what about you?

308
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:32,893
Must be having something in mind.
I know him well. Trust him too.

309
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:17,528
Dead to the world!

310
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:32,887
Devdas!
When did you come?

311
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:39,553
"You're like a mirage.
Seen one moment, gone the next!"

312
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,897
It's so late.
Why aren't you asleep?

313
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:46,892
One can't sleep every might.
- Don't get sleep?

314
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:53,240
"I thought good boys like you
<i>5</i>
never saw moon-lit midnights."

315
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:55,900
But now I know better.

316
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:03,379
What is it? Why this silence?
Anything wrong?

317
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:07,278
"Why have a problem, I think."

318
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,524
Don't you?
- Not at all.

319
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:19,864
Never experienced sorrow?
- Of course. But then this is life.

320
00:44:20,525 --> 00:44:28,376
"Face it happily, or cry over it. To
be happy, one has to cheat oneself."

321
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:36,217
But why do you ask all this?
- Because I like to hear.

322
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:41,217
Really? Then someday
I'll give you an earful.

323
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,884
Listen...

324
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,160
Where do you disappear
throughout the night?

325
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:56,901
"Don't pretend. Don't you know?
- I do, but not properly."

326
00:44:57,295 --> 00:45:01,243
"Well, to know properly, you'll
have to become a dandy like me."

327
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:05,110
I'm told that one forgets
one's sorrows there.

328
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:06,839
Very true.

329
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:14,852
Then take me there with you.
- You? You'll come with me? Okay.

330
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:19,188
We'll go tomorrow.
Now go to sleep. Go on.

331
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:54,458
"Paro, ever since I've come here,
I've thought of nobody but you."

332
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:59,564
Neither of my parents wish
to see us married.

333
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:05,501
I can't find a solution to this.
If I think of your happiness...

334
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,174
I'll give my parents a shock
which I can never dream of doing.

335
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:15,107
That night when you staked
everything and came to me...

336
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,514
"when I recall it,
it hurts me so very much."

337
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:25,394
"But let me make it clear here,
I never realised I loved you."

338
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,137
I just feel so sad that you'll
suffer so much because of me.

339
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:43,209
Please try and forget it.

340
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:47,039
May God give you
success in this.

341
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,164
Just go and post this.
- Very well.

342
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:34,626
How could you do this?
- What?

343
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,021
You did nothing.

344
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:41,528
She was your childhood friend.
She put her reputation at stake...

345
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:46,270
and asked a place at your feet.
And you ran here without meeting her?

346
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,871
I was helpless.
My parents were against it all.

347
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:58,544
"Yes, but how could you lie
that you didn't love her?"

348
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:08,428
There was no other way out.
- But you know how proud...

349
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:13,825
and adamant Paro can be.
Know how your letter will affect her?

350
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:21,071
The river is full of water.
Enough to wash away the stigma.

351
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:30,216
Madhav... Madhav...
- Coming...

352
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,580
Where's the letter I gave you?
- I just posted it.

353
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,144
Aren't you going out?
- I'm getting ready for that only.

354
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,818
Will you cart all this with you?
- Where can I leave it?

355
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,215
"My good man, I leave
my things here too."

356
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,816
I don't aim to come back here.

357
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:17,153
I used to be proud of him. And he
couldn't even do this much for me.

358
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,998
"He couldn't keep my bedding,
nor pay my rent for me"."

359
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:24,033
Come without this tonight.
Tomorrow you can take it with you.

360
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,835
I'm going home.
- Home? And when will you return?

361
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:37,513
Never! Had I known that I'd have
to lose everything to come here.

362
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,313
That I'd be looted...
I'd have never come here.

363
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:50,991
"But, what have you lost?
- I'll tell you if we meet again."

364
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:57,870
Take this money to pay my bill
and give the rest to the servants.

365
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:20,557
Take this inside.
I'll just come.

366
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,594
Whose letter was it?
- For your daughter.

367
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:41,916
But I never realised
that I loved you.

368
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:48,220
Mother! Paro's in-laws
have come to bless her.

369
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,072
Wait!

370
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,348
I'm here now.
- What for?

371
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,514
Don't you remember that night?

372
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:59,086
"Of course, and also your letter.
- Forgive me. I wrote it in haste."

373
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,552
I don't know what came over me...

374
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,456
I couldn't even think.
- Shut up!

375
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,391
I don't want excuses!
- Listen Paro...

376
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:12,875
I'll convince my parents somehow.
- Your parents! And what about mine?

377
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:17,475
"Don't they have a say too?
- Yes, but they're not against us."

378
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:20,245
They are!
Let me go now. Get aside.

379
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:25,883
Have you totally forgotten me?
- I don't trust the likes of you.

380
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:30,885
My parents care for me. Whatever
they've done is for my own good.

381
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:34,219
Now get aside!
- Such ego?

382
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,891
"Why not? If you have an ego,
so do l."

383
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,561
"You may be good-looking,
so all right."

384
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:46,498
I have the looks
and the talents too.

385
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:50,434
"You may be a rich man, but
my parents are not beggars either!"

386
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,906
"If you think you can malign me,
then go ahead."

387
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:59,179
I'll malign you?
How come?

388
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:02,454
Remember that night when
I had come to you?

389
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,123
Go and shout it from the roof-top!
You'll be at peace!

390
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:08,285
<i>“Listen, Pam...“</i>

391
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:18,465
This is your beauty? Too much of it
isn't good. It increases the ego.

392
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:24,211
You know the moon is beautiful...
that's why it has a scar...

393
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,876
Let me scar your face too!

394
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:01,240
Why did you do this?
- Don't be scared.

395
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:06,546
These wounds will heal soon.
Only a scar will remain.

396
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,850
"If somebody asks you about this,
make some excuse."

397
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:14,852
Otherwise tell the truth.

398
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:19,198
<i>“But Devdas...
- Nothing, Faro.“</i>

399
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:24,873
I've just left a mark
to remind you.

400
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,478
"So that whenever you see this
lovely face in the mirror,..."

401
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:33,141
you may remember me.

402
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,875
This is perhaps the relationship
we have shared over many births.

403
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:44,348
But you better forget it.
You know I'm very naive.

404
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:51,356
I can never talk sensibly.
You did the right thing.

405
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,460
You'd have never been
happy with me...

406
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,860
Were you day-dreaming at the lake?
Oh my God!

407
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,871
What's this?
- Holy Mother!

408
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,868
You'll get married soon.

409
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,875
"How did this happen?
- It's nothing, mother."

410
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,007
I just slipped on those steps
and fell down.

411
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:54,891
"What's the matter, dear?
Why so sad?"

412
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:59,557
I've heard that you'll soon
marry a very rich landlord.

413
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:06,164
"Remember you had given us Rs 3/-,
and I had said you'd be a queen?"

414
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:11,836
"l was right, wasn't I?
- Today you'll have to pay us well."

415
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:33,865
"She now belongs to her beloved..."

416
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:38,430
"Now the courtyard she grew up
in seems a strange land..."

417
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:42,867
"for she now belongs
to her beloved"

418
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:56,890
"The bylanes of her father's
village seem quiet..."

419
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:02,820
"Even her childhood friends
don't interest her any more"

420
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,825
"The dreams
dance in her eyes"

421
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:11,435
"And the mind is attracted
by ancient ties"

422
00:57:11,962 --> 00:57:16,843
"Every breath the beloved takes,
seems a message from him"

423
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:20,373
"Now this courtyard
seems a strange land..."

424
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:28,413
"For she now belongs
to her beloved"

425
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:42,861
"Every moment the passion
is getting stronger..."

426
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:48,207
"Every fibre in this
delicate body is taut..."

427
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:56,615
"I can read her mind well.
She's her beloveds now"

428
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:05,552
"Life here seems a punishment.
- This courtyard seems strange too"

429
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:13,202
"She now belongs to her beloved"

430
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:20,834
I wish I could call Devdas
now and show him this beauty.

431
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:29,500
Can't I just meet him once
and pay my respects to him?

432
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:35,178
Forget him. I heard that
he has gone to Calcutta again.

433
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:03,244
"So, you're back again, eh?"

434
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:09,646
When did you come?
- Yesterday.

435
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,883
Then where were you the whole day?
And the night too.

436
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,879
In the park.
- Park?

437
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,553
Are you crazy? What's wrong?

438
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,218
Fought with your father?
- No.

439
01:00:21,685 --> 01:00:24,097
Then maybe with somebody else?
- No...

440
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:29,564
I forgot you were unmarried.
How can you have a fight.

441
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,340
Do one's sorrows really
disappear where you go?

442
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,514
They do...

443
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:47,912
But that place is bad.
- Good or bad... it's all humbug!

444
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:51,248
Take me with you please.

445
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:58,926
"O you erring one...
you're bowled over, too."

446
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:04,269
"l don't mind taking you, but,
it'll be better if you don't go."

447
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:09,867
"l will go, I say.
- Okay. As you wish. Come."

448
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,887
"Get in your bridal-pallaquin, dear."

449
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,991
What hell have you
brought me to?

450
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,904
It's repulsive.

451
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,917
Who is he?
- A wet blanket!

452
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:04,454
"Why did you stop? "You stopped,
and my heart stopped with you..."

453
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:07,124
"Because of this sad burden,
the sky has stooped too!"

454
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,026
Where are you going?
Don't be scared.

455
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,196
Sit down.

456
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:21,034
"Carry on, Master."

457
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:46,898
"At my lover's feet..."

458
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:57,902
"I place my heart, as a gift..."

459
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:09,853
"He picked it up, and
the silly thing said..."

460
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:11,548
"What?"

461
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:19,867
"I leave it to you now..."'

462
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,535
"O dear beloved, my darling...
O cruel one,..."

463
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,463
"I leave it to you now"

464
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:55,900
"Don't ask me why these
fools are sitting here"

465
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:09,112
"I've lost my heart
to your grace"

466
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:22,860
"My lips show life;
and I pine"

467
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:28,532
"There's hope in my eyes...
which I suppress"

468
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:35,872
"But I leave it to you now..."

469
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,475
"O my beloved," my darling
O heartless one..."

470
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,416
"I leave it to you now..."

471
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,184
Wonderfu
...!

472
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:34,866
"Love is an emotional storm..."

473
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,868
"There's a will to live"

474
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:46,203
"And the desire to die too"

475
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:49,475
"But now..."

476
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:55,322
"I leave it to you..."

477
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:58,888
"O my beloved... my darling.
O cruel one"

478
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,491
"The ball is in your court"

479
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:11,169
"O heartless one,
I leave it to you, darling"

480
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,009
Bless you...

481
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,186
If you say so. Come on boys.

482
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,860
Do we have to?
- Yes.

483
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:40,860
Where are you going?
- Outside.

484
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,364
Then come this way.
- Isn't there a door there?

485
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,562
No.
- Okay then.

486
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:50,207
Where are you going? Sit here
I'll just get some cigarettes.

487
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:26,175
"What a shameless girl.
You take money, don't you?"

488
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:32,443
When your feet grace...
- I'm talking about money!

489
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:38,852
"You charge money, don't you?
- Yes. But professionally..."

490
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:41,050
Enough! I don't wish to hear more.

491
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:06,809
Did Devdas go?
- See this... return it to him.

492
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:11,248
Why should I? He gave it to you.
- He didn't give willingly.

493
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,823
"Because I change money,
he got angry and gave me this."

494
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:22,169
Will you do me a favour?
- Yes.

495
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:28,100
Will you bring him here again?
- But he doesn't visit such places.

496
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:31,843
And I don't think he ever will.
But why do you want him here?

497
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:37,517
Just like that.
I wish to see him again.

498
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:44,390
"Fell in love while twirling, eh?
- You don't understand."

499
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:49,853
He's the first man to have given
me money without any motive.

500
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:55,526
Don't you understand?
- I do.

501
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,872
You don't lust for money.

502
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,877
But what's the real reason?
- What a question!

503
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:08,138
I developed a soft-corner for him.
- In 5 minutes flat?

504
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,877
Forget that. Please bring him.

505
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,483
"You will, won't you?
- Maybe."

506
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,225
"Swear on my head!
- If that's how it is,..."

507
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,885
I'll try my best.

508
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,906
You?
- Your mother has given this letter.

509
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:38,578
You walked out without explaining
anything. She's crying ever since.

510
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:56,259
"Here, she has sent this money.
Come, come home with me."

511
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,197
You go back.
I'm not going back.

512
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:04,869
"Come, my dear.
Take care of your new home now."

513
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,549
"Mother, I'm your eldest son."

514
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:27,556
"Let me pay my respects,
as your eldest son."

515
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:38,896
It's 2 years now that my mom died.
Ever since we've faced hardships.

516
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:45,245
"Now that you've come, bless us
that we all lead a happy life."

517
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:51,909
"Where's your sister, Yashoda?
- With her in-laws."

518
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:56,256
"I had sent her a letter, but she...
couldn't come."

519
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:01,862
"Couldn't come, or didn't come?
- I don't really know."

520
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:07,232
But if father goes to get her...
- Why should he?

521
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,859
How about you and I going?

522
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:13,197
No. Why you?
I'll go myself to get her.

523
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:20,872
"No, I don't want to go!
- Don't say that. Why not meet her?"

524
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:24,885
"Come in, my dear."

525
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:35,486
Are you cross with your new mom?
- No. Why should I be?

526
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:37,654
Sit.

527
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:45,595
What's this?
- Nothing.

528
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,064
Just your mother's necklace

529
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:59,316
This is your father's house.
Such a huge house needs servants.

530
01:13:00,243 --> 01:13:02,849
"I'm also one of them, nothing else."

531
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:08,462
ls it nice for you to
get angry at servants?

532
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:11,192
"I beg you, mom."

533
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,856
Please forgive me.

534
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:20,863
"So, how's our new mom?
- Nice."

535
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,633
Shall I tell her
what all you said?

536
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,106
No! I beg you.
Don't tell her anything.

537
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:46,891
You've saved me from humiliation.
Won my children over too.

538
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:53,899
"Fixed our elder son's marriage too.
May God bless you. Be happy, dear."

539
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:59,445
What are you saying?
- I wish I could explain better.

540
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:10,180
I did wrong.
- What do you mean?

541
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,120
What shall I say?

542
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:18,262
I think you're a misfit here.
- Why do you say that?

543
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,025
And what difference
does it make anyway?

544
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:45,217
Why does he do this?
- Why? What happened?

545
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,487
Can't you see how he paces up
and down like a mad man?

546
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,421
"What for, I say!"

547
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:57,904
One blind man is asking another
blind man. I really don't know.

548
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,841
"He hasn't fought with
his parents, has he?"

549
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,345
Nothing like that.
- Then?

550
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:14,186
I think this happened after
his childhood pal went away.

551
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:20,391
Then we're very much alike.

552
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:26,156
Then go and talk to him.
He doesn't listen to me at all.

553
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,867
"Convince him somehow,
and send him back to his mother."

554
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:34,164
Okay. I'll try some trick.

555
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:44,249
What's wrong? What happened?
- Nothing.

556
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:48,879
Tell me.
- There's nothing to tell.

557
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:57,896
"Do one thing, come with me.
- Where?"

558
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,497
Where we went that day.

559
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:08,432
I don't like it.
- Okay.

560
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,542
Are you going there?
- Yes.

561
01:16:11,968 --> 01:16:14,505
"I won't, if you say so.
- No, I won't stop you."

562
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:19,178
But what hopes do you carry?
What do you get there?

563
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:24,414
I get nothing.
I go there to pass my time.

564
01:16:26,282 --> 01:16:30,287
And time really passes?
Mine seems to drag.

565
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,865
"Then come with me. I'll see that
your time not just passes, but runs!"

566
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:30,381
"My dear guest,
wait for some time"

567
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:34,856
"it's very difficult out there
with countless woes"

568
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:39,130
"My dear guest,
now that you're here"

569
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:09,491
"Come, let me hide you in my eyes;
And hide you in my colourful shawl"

570
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:17,834
"And offer my heart to you
O shy one..."

571
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:24,434
"O shy one, wait here for some time
it's difficult out there..."

572
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:31,010
"with countless woes.
My dear guest, now that you're here"

573
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:21,159
"There's magic in the air, and,
my hair is smelling so sweetly"

574
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:29,265
"Listen to what your heart is saying
Oh I say! O cruel one..."

575
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:36,173
"O heartless one, wait for some time
it's very difficult out there..."

576
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:42,180
with countless woes.
My dear quest, now that you're here"

577
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:15,146
"Get lost in the tinkle of my
anklets and in the world of dreams"

578
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:23,362
"Stay on here as my guest,
my honoured guest, O cruel one"

579
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:30,234
"O, cruel one, wait for some time.
It's difficult out there..."'

580
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:36,440
"with countless woes.
My dear guest, now that you're here"

581
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:49,912
I'm sorry but it's my duty to tell
the truth. Your father's critical.

582
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:55,585
"Carry on with the medicines I gave.
Rest, leave it to heaven."

583
01:22:01,851 --> 01:22:08,132
Don't waste time. Inform Devdas.
- How? I must have his address.

584
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,867
Then go and get him.
- Don't be silly!

585
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:14,196
How can I leave father?

586
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:17,410
We'll wire Dharamdas there.
He find him and bring him home.

587
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:05,524
Enough.
- Why?

588
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:11,997
You've just taken to alcohol.
You may not endure it.

589
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:17,029
Which fool drinks
to be able to endure?

590
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:28,139
I drink to be able to breathe
and since I don't have the guts...

591
01:23:28,537 --> 01:23:34,886
"to get up and go from here,
I loll around. That's all."

592
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:46,899
I just keep looking at your face.
Even then I'm not completely out...

593
01:23:49,892 --> 01:23:55,899
I'm <i>in</i> my senses a little bit.
Tell consciousness...

594
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,572
never to be conscious.

595
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:07,320
"Some people who come here,
don't even touch alcohol."

596
01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:10,380
Really?

597
01:24:13,849 --> 01:24:21,859
"If I had a gun, I'd shoot them.
They're bigger sinners than me."

598
01:24:25,995 --> 01:24:34,005
"Firstly, I'll not stop drinking, and
if I do, I'll never come here."

599
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:37,541
Never!

600
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:47,885
There's a solution for my problem.
But what about them...

601
01:24:49,384 --> 01:24:54,163
"who don't touch liquor,
but still come here?"

602
01:24:56,892 --> 01:25:02,342
I'm so sorry that
I took to drinking.

603
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:19,450
"Don't touch me!
I'm still conscious, you know."

604
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:30,261
"You don't know, how I hate your sort.
And I always will."

605
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:39,210
"But even then I'll come to you,
sit with you, and chat."

606
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,876
"No other way out, is there?"

607
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:48,547
Will your lot ever understand this?

608
01:25:53,649 --> 01:26:01,158
"People sin in the dark, and I come
here during the day, and get sozzled!"

609
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:11,841
You are a living example
of endurance.

610
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:24,023
You say you love me...
But I don't want it.

611
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:33,029
I really don't. No!
People indulge in dramatics.

612
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:41,202
They do make up and become
kings and queens...

613
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:51,208
"They love, or rather pretend to.
And it all seems real."

614
01:26:54,877 --> 01:27:00,156
"You're no different,
you act too and I watch."

615
01:27:03,819 --> 01:27:10,532
"Even then, I remember Paro,
so very much!"

616
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:26,844
Everything got over in a moment.
She chose the path of matrimony...

617
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:31,848
"and I, of destruction!"

618
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:38,863
And a never-ending drama began!

619
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:46,530
Who is it? Parvati?

620
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:58,409
<i>“You're not Pam,
so why do you cw?“</i>

621
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:13,162
"One small mistake, and such
a severe punishment for it?"

622
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:20,270
Why does her memory
haunt me like this?

623
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:26,276
Why can't I forget her?

624
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:36,913
Come... go and sleep now.
- Sleep?

625
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:43,860
"I'm an alcoholic, and,
she, a..."

626
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:54,872
"Okay, so be it. Nothing wrong.
No hopes, no trust."

627
01:28:56,865 --> 01:29:02,975
"No happiness, nor any desire.
Wonderful!"

628
01:29:33,802 --> 01:29:36,749
"ls Devdas here?
- Yes, but he's sleeping."

629
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:39,415
You can't meet him now.
- Why not?

630
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:42,554
I'll meet him alright.
Where have you hidden him?

631
01:29:43,145 --> 01:29:46,149
I won't let him stay in this hell.
- Who is it?

632
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:54,531
You? What are you doing here?
- Your friend...

633
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:56,561
Why are you here?

634
01:29:56,792 --> 01:30:01,172
Get out of here!
I won't go with you.

635
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:02,904
Wait!

636
01:30:06,168 --> 01:30:12,517
"l got a telegram. Master's no more.
He left us all, and passed on..."

637
01:30:14,676 --> 01:30:19,557
"So come home now. If not for
anyone, for your mother at least."

638
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:35,531
I don't want to live either.
What's the point in living?

639
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:59,428
Paro! What a surprise!
No letter or a message even.

640
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:03,769
I got Manudidi's letter saying
Devdas's father was serious...

641
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:11,110
"He's no more, my dear.
- Dead? I'll go there and come."

642
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,806
When did you come?
- Today.

643
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:54,584
"An age has passed since I met you.
You're well, aren't you?"

644
01:31:56,478 --> 01:31:59,391
"Your husband and the kids,...
are they well too?"

645
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:01,716
All are fine.

646
01:32:03,151 --> 01:32:06,155
"You'll be here for a few days,
I suppose."

647
01:32:09,391 --> 01:32:12,099
Okay then.
I'll see you later.

648
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:31,122
"Parvati, you've come? Good!
You may be able to save Devdas."

649
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:34,620
Why? What's happened?
- I wish I could tell you.

650
01:32:35,116 --> 01:32:38,325
Master's gone and Devdas has
access to all the money.

651
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:42,362
It'll be very difficult now.
- What'll be difficult? Tell me.

652
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:47,797
"What do I tell you?
He neither eats, nor sleeps."

653
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:52,477
Just drinks bottles of liquor
and disappears for 3-4 days.

654
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:55,472
And I hear that he's got
some ornaments made too.

655
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,478
For whom?

656
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:06,525
How much cash did father leave.
- 1.5 lakhs.

657
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,755
How much will I get?

658
01:33:09,184 --> 01:33:13,428
"Half for you, and half for me.
- How about Ma?"

659
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:16,666
Why does she need the cash?
She's the mistress of the house.

660
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:21,369
We've to take care of her.
I've come to this conclusion...

661
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:25,271
"that we needn't spend more than
10,000 for father's rites."

662
01:33:25,734 --> 01:33:32,276
It'll be the last expenditure on him.
Mom wishes to give food and alms.

663
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:36,783
"That should cost about 30,000l-.
- What!"

664
01:33:37,512 --> 01:33:39,458
Yes. Do one thing then.

665
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,460
"Take 25,000l- from my share
and you contribute 5,000l-."

666
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:49,291
"The rest of the 50,000l- can be
divided between mother and myself."

667
01:33:49,858 --> 01:33:54,603
What do you think?
- Okay. You know I'm a family man...

668
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:58,143
"with many responsibilities.
Then, shall we make it legal?"

669
01:33:58,533 --> 01:34:03,744
"Is it necessary? I don't like it.
- But if later on, if there's..."

670
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:06,151
"Okay, then get it done."

671
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,842
Now suppose I malign you?

672
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:55,125
"Feeling shy, eh? But why feel shy?
We were both childiseh..."

673
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:03,734
And see what happened in between.
You let your tongue wag in anger...

674
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:09,072
And I also gave you that
scar on your forehead!

675
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:14,447
This scar is my joy and wealth.
My sole shelter.

676
01:35:17,179 --> 01:35:19,420
Why don't you say something?

677
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:30,092
I get very angry with you at times.
Father's dead. It's so painful.

678
01:35:32,327 --> 01:35:35,331
"Had you been here,
would this pain be still there?"

679
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:40,771
"You know my sis-in-law, and,
my brother's nature too."

680
01:35:42,604 --> 01:35:45,608
Where will I go with my mother?

681
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:54,525
"And then, I don't know what's
going to happen to me, either."

682
01:35:56,584 --> 01:36:00,122
"If you had been here,
I'd have left it to you and relaxed."

683
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,466
"What's this, you're crying?"

684
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:08,664
Never mind. Let's stop
this topic here.

685
01:36:10,065 --> 01:36:12,067
"No, keep talking."

686
01:36:13,468 --> 01:36:19,077
"I hear you've become a typical
housewife. A big house, big estate."

687
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:26,420
"Grown up children. A big shot for
a husband. Everything 'big', eh?"

688
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:30,585
Will you do me a favour?

689
01:36:33,088 --> 01:36:34,431
Yes?

690
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:41,107
Will I get a girl from your town?
Feel like settling down.

691
01:36:42,097 --> 01:36:48,104
"A beautiful girl, right?
- Yes. Just like you."

692
01:36:49,437 --> 01:36:54,284
"Good natured?
- No, wicked."

693
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:57,590
"One who'll fight with me,
like you."

694
01:36:58,113 --> 01:37:05,122
Thousands like me will fall at your
feet and think themselves lucky.

695
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:08,565
I don't want thousands.
Just one will do.

696
01:37:15,063 --> 01:37:17,407
May I ask you something?
- Yes.

697
01:37:20,235 --> 01:37:23,079
When did you start to drink?

698
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:26,745
Who told you?
- Anybody.

699
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:31,421
ls it true?
- Yes.

700
01:37:34,482 --> 01:37:35,756
It's true.

701
01:37:44,759 --> 01:37:48,263
You've made ornaments worth
thousands to give her.

702
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:54,443
I've just got them made.
Not given. Do you want them?

703
01:37:55,103 --> 01:38:00,109
"Yes, give them to me.
Look, I've nothing on me."

704
01:38:00,842 --> 01:38:06,451
"Didn't your husband give you any?
- He had, but I gave them..."

705
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,059
to his daughter.

706
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:15,064
I don't think you need ornaments.

707
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:26,569
And what you heard is a lie.
I don't love any woman.

708
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:39,086
Promise me one thing.
That you'll never drink liquor.

709
01:38:41,316 --> 01:38:43,762
That's impossible.
- Why?

710
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:48,090
Will you promise
not to remember me?

711
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,700
I've some work downstairs.
I'll go now.

712
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,371
No!

713
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:02,111
First promise me.
- No.

714
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:06,108
Why not?
- Does everybody do everything?

715
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:09,115
"Where there's a will,
there's a way."

716
01:39:09,577 --> 01:39:11,818
Then can you elope
with me tonight?

717
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:24,729
<i>“R's evening. Go home, Pam.
- Promise me.“</i>

718
01:39:26,194 --> 01:39:32,543
It's not nice to force somebody.
I may not keep my word.

719
01:39:34,569 --> 01:39:36,571
Open the door.

720
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:44,683
"I'm suffocating, Devclas.
- Don't I know it?"

721
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:51,152
I'm dying within because I could
not serve you. Come to my place.

722
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:53,828
There's nobody here
to take care of you.

723
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:58,762
Come to your place?
You'll take care of me?

724
01:39:59,928 --> 01:40:04,536
That's my life's ambition.
Help me fulfill it.

725
01:40:05,934 --> 01:40:12,112
"After that, even if I die,
I don't care. Come with me."

726
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:18,386
"l will.
- Swear it on me, that you will come."

727
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:25,390
"I'll never forget this. If you're
happy to serve me, I'll come."

728
01:40:26,788 --> 01:40:29,132
I'll definitely come.

729
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:44,479
Welcome my dear...
The wealth of my house.

730
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:01,425
The beggars are making a lot
of fuss for not getting clothes.

731
01:41:01,689 --> 01:41:05,159
"Why didn't they get? They should
get too, with everybody else."

732
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:08,269
"Tell the Munim, he'll see to it.
- Okay."

733
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,774
Silence. My mother said
everybody will get clothes.

734
01:41:16,204 --> 01:41:19,447
Long live our Mistress.

735
01:41:34,488 --> 01:41:39,403
"Listen, does Chandramukhi...
- Yes, come in."

736
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:53,548
Why is this room like this?
And where's Chandramukhi?

737
01:41:59,147 --> 01:42:00,148
Yqu?

738
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:06,523
What happened to you?
- Happened?

739
01:42:07,555 --> 01:42:10,434
I think something
good happened to me.

740
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,303
Have you forgotten me so soon?

741
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:24,111
You look thin. Were you ill?
- Not physically.

742
01:42:25,406 --> 01:42:31,357
No ornaments on your body...
The house is vacant. How come?

743
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,282
I sold everything.

744
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:39,131
"And what about the instruments,
and musicians?"

745
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,796
I've left all that.

746
01:42:43,558 --> 01:42:46,562
This hall of yours
has completely changed.

747
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:53,476
"Not just the hall, but
the inner-rooms too. Come."

748
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:23,102
Doesn't my old friend come now?
- No. He had come 2 months ago.

749
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:27,706
He fought with me and went.
He has taken a job somewhere.

750
01:43:28,102 --> 01:43:30,446
What was the fight about?

751
01:43:31,105 --> 01:43:34,518
He had come to sell...
But I showed him the door.

752
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:40,786
Sell what?
- Wheat!

753
01:43:43,117 --> 01:43:47,395
You really are too straight.
He had got a big fish for me!

754
01:43:48,122 --> 01:43:52,832
Rs.500 a month. Plus jewellery.
Two body-guards at the door.

755
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:56,141
But where is all that?
I can't see anybody.

756
01:43:56,564 --> 01:44:00,137
"You would, had they stayed.
I shooed out every one of them."

757
01:44:00,401 --> 01:44:04,144
Their crime?
- No crime. I just didn't like it all.

758
01:44:05,206 --> 01:44:07,686
Nobody's been here
since you went away.

759
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:13,590
"So you've shut shutters, eh?
- Yes, since insolvency crept in."

760
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:19,087
How will you pull along now?
- I can't afford the city life...

761
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:22,090
so I thought I'd go to
a cheaper place.

762
01:44:22,257 --> 01:44:24,601
Why didn't you?

763
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:30,108
I just hoped to see you again.
I knew you'd come one day.

764
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:34,102
Just to see me? Why?

765
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:40,108
Because you hated me so much.

766
01:44:40,508 --> 01:44:48,518
Nobody had ever hated me like you.
So many men had come and gone.

767
01:44:50,551 --> 01:44:58,561
But none had the spark I saw
in you. You cast a spell on me.

768
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:05,467
From then on I changed drastically.
I saw everything differently.

769
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:14,083
Then you began to hit the bottle.
I simply hate alcohol.

770
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:19,084
"When somebody gets drunk and
misbehaves, I get angry."

771
01:45:21,149 --> 01:45:26,428
"But when you did the same,
I used to cry."

772
01:45:29,223 --> 01:45:36,698
"Once you said I endured much,
that day I found my self-esteem."

773
01:45:38,099 --> 01:45:39,908
And I left everything.

774
01:45:42,537 --> 01:45:48,112
"True, but then women are fickle."

775
01:45:54,181 --> 01:46:02,123
Has Parvati hurt you so much?
- Why do you ask?

776
01:46:03,424 --> 01:46:11,366
"Because I've done business of love
for years, but I've loved only one."

777
01:46:13,134 --> 01:46:17,344
"Loving is one thing, and
physical attraction is another."

778
01:46:18,773 --> 01:46:23,085
Men fall easily for physical
attraction. We women don't.

779
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:29,494
You express love.
Make noise about it.

780
01:46:30,718 --> 01:46:36,100
Even then we keep quiet and
accept this new way of life.

781
01:46:36,758 --> 01:46:40,433
"But even at that time,
we don't know what is love."

782
01:46:42,096 --> 01:46:49,514
Later when at some odd moment we
give vent to our inner conflict...

783
01:46:50,705 --> 01:46:56,121
"you men hit the roof, and call
us "Characterless", "traitors"..."

784
01:47:02,216 --> 01:47:06,460
Don't be scared.
I don't mean your Parvati.

785
01:47:08,723 --> 01:47:14,674
"Maybe she's more beautiful.
But I still know this, that..."

786
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:21,076
"she must've fallen in love first,
and even expressed it to you first."

787
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:27,085
"I've come to know from myself,
how much she loves you."

788
01:47:29,343 --> 01:47:33,416
"What?
- I'm not talking about myself,..."

789
01:47:35,082 --> 01:47:37,585
but speaking on her behalf.

790
01:47:40,554 --> 01:47:46,630
"What could be more tragic, than
one who's not loved by the man..."

791
01:47:47,195 --> 01:47:50,108
sits and narrates the
love-story forcibly.

792
01:47:54,268 --> 01:47:57,112
I better go now.
- Sit a while.

793
01:47:59,574 --> 01:48:05,115
"I've never seen you sober, or
ever spoken to you like this."

794
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:15,057
Before this you never saw my face
till you were completely sozzled.

795
01:48:17,058 --> 01:48:22,064
"This year at least I won't touch
liquor. I lost my father, remember."

796
01:48:24,365 --> 01:48:29,474
Will you drink again?
- Can't say.

797
01:48:30,805 --> 01:48:35,686
"Leave it forever, if you can.
Don't spoil your life."

798
01:48:47,087 --> 01:48:48,566
I'll go now.

799
01:48:53,093 --> 01:48:55,095
Bless me happiness.

800
01:49:04,705 --> 01:49:11,122
"Wherever you go, keep in touch.
And don't feel awkward to ask help."

801
01:49:33,134 --> 01:49:35,478
Hope you're well.
- Yes.

802
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:39,144
I feel happy meeting you all.

803
01:49:42,143 --> 01:49:44,145
"Okay then, be happy."

804
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:06,167
"Ever since you left,
the village isn't the same."

805
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:12,107
"Devdas does come here, but only to
fight with his brother and for money."

806
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:17,681
He takes money from here and spends
it there. His father died 2 years ago.

807
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:22,557
And within this period he has blown
50% of the cash. I think...

808
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:28,465
Thank God you didn't marry him.
He's here at the moment.

809
01:50:28,889 --> 01:50:31,529
And shoots birds the whole day.

810
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:37,473
"When his head throbs due to the sun,
he sits under a tree and thinks."

811
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,133
Like a forlorn lover.

812
01:51:02,423 --> 01:51:05,836
"O beloved...
Dear beloved"

813
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:30,119
"What kind of inextinguishable
fire am I experiencing?"

814
01:51:37,825 --> 01:51:40,829
"O dear darling beloved"

815
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:48,864
"With a yearning in the heart
and with forlorn eyes..."

816
01:53:11,819 --> 01:53:19,829
"Only the tears remain
and my night is spoilt"

817
01:53:32,773 --> 01:53:36,448
"O dear beloved..."

818
01:54:07,474 --> 01:54:11,479
Get my litter ready.
I'll go to my mother's place today.

819
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:15,088
But father's out of town. We also
have religious rites tomorrow.

820
01:54:15,382 --> 01:54:19,660
Don't argue. I know everything.
Just do as I say. I must go.

821
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:21,088
Okay.

822
01:54:27,594 --> 01:54:29,096
Hurry up men.

823
01:54:55,322 --> 01:54:59,634
"Where's Devdas?
- I tried my best, but in vain."

824
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:02,807
And he left for Calcutta by
the morning train.

825
01:55:03,797 --> 01:55:05,674
He's gone?

826
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:25,426
"Did you go to the post office?
- Yes, but there's no letter."

827
01:55:29,089 --> 01:55:35,836
"it's been 3 months now.
He hasn't written, nor replied mine."

828
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:59,120
How far is the house of the
Landlord of Talsonapur from here?

829
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:04,129
About 2 miles. He himself is
dead but his 2 sons are there.

830
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:11,739
Can you take me there?
- Why not? Whenever you say so.

831
01:56:12,566 --> 01:56:16,070
"Not whenever, but now! Get ready.
- Okay, Ma'am."

832
01:56:32,219 --> 01:56:39,103
"There is cool shade at one place
and hot sun in another"

833
01:56:49,269 --> 01:56:57,120
"This is one face of it.
And so is that one"

834
01:57:09,456 --> 01:57:16,465
"Some will lose here.
And some will gain too"

835
01:57:23,737 --> 01:57:31,747
"Travellers, some will go...
and some will come"

836
01:58:31,071 --> 01:58:32,744
Why didn't you come that day?

837
01:58:33,073 --> 01:58:36,213
My baby's sick.
- As usual!

838
01:58:36,476 --> 01:58:40,083
But who'll do the work here?
Better not take any more leave.

839
01:58:44,485 --> 01:58:48,092
Greetings.
- Who are you?

840
01:58:50,424 --> 01:58:54,702
One of your subjects.
I've brought the rent.

841
01:58:55,195 --> 01:58:56,367
Sit down.

842
01:58:56,563 --> 01:58:59,772
Where do you live?
- On one of your estates.

843
01:59:02,102 --> 01:59:08,712
"The ownership is shared, isn't it?
- Yes, but we'll be sole owners soon."

844
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:13,524
The younger one lost his share in
drinks and womanising.

845
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:16,690
God knows how much money he
has squandered!

846
01:59:18,285 --> 01:59:21,664
Doesn't he ever come here?
- He was here recently.

847
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:26,534
"Fought with his elder brother,
took some money, and went away."

848
01:59:27,694 --> 01:59:31,141
When will he come again?
- I doubt if he'll come.

849
01:59:31,465 --> 01:59:36,141
"He's always sick, and now
he may not live for long."

850
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:41,676
Where does he stay in Calcutta?
- Who knows? He eats in a hotel...

851
01:59:42,209 --> 01:59:46,157
"and sleeps here and there.
It's his problem, not ours!"

852
01:59:47,147 --> 01:59:51,493
"Okay then, I'll go now.
- Take her to the office."

853
01:59:52,152 --> 01:59:54,428
"Don't bother, I'll go myself."

854
01:59:57,257 --> 02:00:04,641
"You have such lovely saris, so
why do you wear these simple ones?"

855
02:00:05,165 --> 02:00:07,702
Just like that.
- And that jewellery?

856
02:00:08,101 --> 02:00:09,705
Who is it for after all?

857
02:00:09,803 --> 02:00:12,807
I gave them to Yashoda.
- Good.

858
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,784
But I had got new ones
made for you.

859
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:20,381
Even then you live like an ascetic!
- Not at all.

860
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:27,527
You live simply. So do I.
- Never mind me. I'm old.

861
02:00:28,388 --> 02:00:31,665
But you're not.
Wear some pieces of jewellery.

862
02:00:32,192 --> 02:00:34,138
I don't like them.

863
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:48,480
"Who is it? Chameli?
Come in, and shut the door."

864
02:00:57,150 --> 02:01:02,156
"My, my! Such beauty?
It'll all be electric tonight."

865
02:01:02,823 --> 02:01:08,671
What is it? You just got up and
left one day. And you're back again?

866
02:01:10,097 --> 02:01:14,443
I'm going to seek my groom!
- Groom? What do you mean?

867
02:01:15,302 --> 02:01:18,772
You'll know when he comes.
- I see.

868
02:01:21,508 --> 02:01:24,318
I think it's him.
I better go.

869
02:01:36,223 --> 02:01:39,466
Here I am.
- Who are you?

870
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:46,141
"Hey, you're somebody else.
But you're too good also."

871
02:01:46,533 --> 02:01:48,410
You're also nice.
- Get out!

872
02:01:48,502 --> 02:01:50,607
"What did you say?
- I said, out!"

873
02:01:50,803 --> 02:01:57,550
"Out, eh? There! Now may I ask
why I'm being thrown out?"

874
02:01:57,878 --> 02:02:00,484
"I mean, what for? Why?"

875
02:02:01,581 --> 02:02:04,755
Does a man called Devdas
come here?

876
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:07,631
Who is he?

877
02:02:07,788 --> 02:02:12,362
"Fair, with thick brows and
bright eyes. A big shot."

878
02:02:12,759 --> 02:02:17,367
He gives away lots of money too.
- No. I'm not so lucky.

879
02:02:49,229 --> 02:02:51,140
Stop! Stop driver.

880
02:03:56,896 --> 02:03:59,740
Why are you in this gutter?
Come home.

881
02:04:00,133 --> 02:04:06,414
Heart broken people like me...
Who cares whether we live or die?

882
02:04:19,152 --> 02:04:27,094
Today I left your company.
Tomorrow I'll leave this world!

883
02:04:38,872 --> 02:04:42,445
Do you want liquor?
- Yes. Where will I get it?

884
02:04:43,109 --> 02:04:48,787
Come. I'll get it for you.
- Where did you come from darling?

885
02:04:50,117 --> 02:04:58,127
Wow! So beautiful.
- Yes. But come now.

886
02:05:06,566 --> 02:05:13,347
"You know me, beautiful?
- Yes I do. Now come along."

887
02:05:16,743 --> 02:05:20,520
"Where have you brought me?
Anyway, get me some liquor."

888
02:05:22,082 --> 02:05:24,084
No liquor.
- What!

889
02:05:24,617 --> 02:05:27,097
Then why did you bring me here?

890
02:05:27,420 --> 02:05:31,766
"Lied to me, eh?
Go get it somehow."

891
02:05:32,592 --> 02:05:38,099
You shouldn't drink.
- Who are you to lecture me?

892
02:05:39,165 --> 02:05:43,636
"Go and get, else I'll leave.
Don't go. You're not well."

893
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:51,585
I'll die or go to hell.
How are you concerned? Not well...

894
02:05:52,111 --> 02:05:54,785
Sit down. I'll order it for you.

895
02:05:55,849 --> 02:05:58,625
Till then see my dance.
- Dance?

896
02:07:01,314 --> 02:07:07,060
"Where will I get the status
which you'll accept"

897
02:07:07,487 --> 02:07:13,733
"Where will I get the charm from
which will attract you?"

898
02:07:36,249 --> 02:07:42,256
"I'm that flower which has been
squashed by everyone"

899
02:07:42,722 --> 02:07:48,502
"And my youth has gone...
washed away in my tears"

900
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:55,112
"Where will I get that cloud
which will shower flowers?"

901
02:07:55,534 --> 02:08:01,450
"Where will I get the status
which will attract you?"

902
02:08:02,108 --> 02:08:05,112
"Whom you'll accept..."

903
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:39,447
"You pine for somebody else
and I yearn for you"

904
02:08:40,079 --> 02:08:45,688
"There's only sorrow in your heart,
but in mine, there's just you"

905
02:08:46,419 --> 02:08:52,097
"Where will I get the balm
which will soothe our hearts?"

906
02:08:52,758 --> 02:08:58,504
"Where will I get that 'forever'
which will attract you?"

907
02:09:38,405 --> 02:09:44,412
"My helplessness is obvious,
by my sighs"

908
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:50,560
"Even having asked for death,
I couldn't die because I was scared"

909
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:56,828
"Where will I get the prayers
to fullfill your wishes?"

910
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:03,570
"Where do I get the forever
which will attract you?"

911
02:11:07,093 --> 02:11:13,339
Where did you steal me from?
- I picked you off the road!

912
02:11:14,867 --> 02:11:21,284
And what's this? Bedecked with
ornaments like a new bride.

913
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:27,118
Who gave them to you?
- Again?

914
02:11:29,248 --> 02:11:31,250
I was just joking.

915
02:11:32,118 --> 02:11:35,122
They weren't a gift nor were they
made to order. They're artificial.

916
02:11:35,621 --> 02:11:40,127
I've been here over a month for you.
I found this house. Paid the rent.

917
02:11:40,626 --> 02:11:45,473
And bought these ornaments.
I had to spend a lot for nothing!

918
02:11:46,232 --> 02:11:49,543
And look at you!
You couldn't even recognise me.

919
02:11:51,137 --> 02:11:55,142
"Maybe, but it did cross my mind,
after I heard your voice."

920
02:11:56,576 --> 02:12:02,652
And kept on thinking who else can
serve me except my Chandramukhi?

921
02:12:10,423 --> 02:12:18,433
Do you hate me just as much even now?
- No. I love you.

922
02:12:29,542 --> 02:12:34,787
"My Chandramukhi"!
Dear Lord..."

923
02:12:46,525 --> 02:12:53,135
"My heart sings with joy"

924
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:59,149
"My beloved is home"

925
02:13:10,550 --> 02:13:15,226
What happened? What's wrong?
It's not total ruin is it?

926
02:13:16,322 --> 02:13:19,326
"There's no chest pain, is there?
- I don't know."

927
02:13:20,093 --> 02:13:22,369
Please lie down.

928
02:13:26,833 --> 02:13:28,835
I'll go and get a doctor.

929
02:13:31,370 --> 02:13:36,115
I think you're recovering.
- Because of your medicines.

930
02:13:36,609 --> 02:13:40,113
"No. Because of her prayers,
and selfless nursing."

931
02:13:41,347 --> 02:13:46,126
But don't think you're 100% fit.
You must take care of your health.

932
02:13:46,519 --> 02:13:52,128
Liquor is poison for you.
Go out of town for a few days.

933
02:13:53,125 --> 02:13:54,729
Okay then.

934
02:14:01,133 --> 02:14:04,137
Doctor said you should
go out of town.

935
02:14:08,274 --> 02:14:14,418
Why do you look after me like this?
- Don't you know why even now?

936
02:14:16,416 --> 02:14:22,765
"I do, but what's the point?
See how I adore Parvati..."

937
02:14:23,422 --> 02:14:28,098
and she too loved me so much!
But the society didn't accept.

938
02:14:29,629 --> 02:14:34,544
And what did we get except sorrow?
After this experience...

939
02:14:34,801 --> 02:14:39,511
I had vowed never to get trapped.
And it wasn't my doing either.

940
02:14:40,873 --> 02:14:45,117
Why did you do this?
Why did you develop these ties?

941
02:14:46,512 --> 02:14:49,118
I think you too will
invite sorrow like Paro did.

942
02:14:52,585 --> 02:14:55,794
You both are so different
yet so alike.

943
02:14:56,789 --> 02:15:01,135
One <i>so</i> selfless and fickle...
The other <i>so</i> quiet and sober.

944
02:15:01,794 --> 02:15:05,674
"She couldn't bear anything,
and, you bear everything!"

945
02:15:06,565 --> 02:15:10,069
"She's respected so much,
and you, exactly opposite."

946
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:18,088
"Everybody loves her, and hates you.
But I don't hate you, I can't."

947
02:15:22,848 --> 02:15:28,093
This is enough for me.
I don't want anything else.

948
02:15:36,095 --> 02:15:38,097
The carriage is here.

949
02:15:41,334 --> 02:15:43,336
Take the bedding.

950
02:15:53,279 --> 02:15:56,488
Where is my scarf?
- On the chair.

951
02:16:04,524 --> 02:16:07,403
Are you crying?
- No.

952
02:16:08,393 --> 02:16:10,202
Look at me.

953
02:16:11,330 --> 02:16:13,332
"Come on, look up."

954
02:16:17,069 --> 02:16:18,241
Look!

955
02:16:21,774 --> 02:16:29,090
"This bag, clothes, are unnecessary.
- That I know better."

956
02:16:39,091 --> 02:16:47,101
"Listen, you'll need someone
with you. Take me along."

957
02:16:51,871 --> 02:16:59,585
That's impossible. People will
insult you and I won't stand it.

958
02:17:00,346 --> 02:17:08,288
"I'm very worried. You're not well.
How will you go alone, stay alone?"

959
02:17:11,157 --> 02:17:14,229
I've penned to Dharamdas.
He'll come to collect me.

960
02:17:17,162 --> 02:17:19,733
Will you promise me something?
- What?

961
02:17:21,066 --> 02:17:23,672
That you'll not drink again.

962
02:17:28,374 --> 02:17:33,084
"l can't promise,
but I'll remember what you said."

963
02:17:38,484 --> 02:17:40,259
Listen...

964
02:17:42,688 --> 02:17:50,698
"wherever you live, if your body
lets you down, call this slave."

965
02:17:59,872 --> 02:18:04,872
"Look, keep this with you.
- No! I don't need it now."

966
02:18:13,052 --> 02:18:17,398
That I know better.
Look at me.

967
02:18:20,392 --> 02:18:24,397
There's no guarantee about life.
Will you drown yourself?

968
02:18:27,066 --> 02:18:29,672
"Keep this, and don't say a word."

969
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:35,675
Please wait.

970
02:18:47,153 --> 02:18:55,095
When will we meet again?
- Who knows? But I won't forget you.

971
02:18:57,563 --> 02:18:59,804
I'll never get enough of you.

972
02:19:01,267 --> 02:19:05,272
Can't say what those who believe in
Sin and Virtue will decide about you.

973
02:19:06,705 --> 02:19:11,677
"But if people meet after death, I
won't be able to stay away from you."

974
02:19:27,859 --> 02:19:31,534
"I'll pass this life,
awaiting that paradise."

975
02:20:23,915 --> 02:20:27,124
Decided where to go?
- No.

976
02:20:27,553 --> 02:20:29,260
Then go to Kashi to your mother.

977
02:20:29,454 --> 02:20:34,130
I won't go there.
I wish to go somewhere faraway.

978
02:21:22,807 --> 02:21:27,347
"I came to know from myself,
how much Parvati must love you"

979
02:22:09,621 --> 02:22:12,761
Decided where to go?
- No.

980
02:22:13,092 --> 02:22:14,765
Then go to Kashi to your mother.

981
02:22:15,093 --> 02:22:19,599
I won't go there.
I wish to go somewhere faraway.

982
02:23:08,480 --> 02:23:13,088
"I came to know from myself,
how much Parvati must love you"

983
02:23:54,859 --> 02:24:02,141
Just tell me where you want to go.
- I want to run away from myself.

984
02:24:02,601 --> 02:24:05,480
I don't understand
what you're saying.

985
02:24:07,739 --> 02:24:12,415
I won't eat anything. You carry on.
- Why won't you eat? Are you ill?

986
02:24:12,811 --> 02:24:14,688
"No.
- And why not,..."

987
02:24:14,813 --> 02:24:16,759
if you torture yourself
like this?

988
02:24:17,148 --> 02:24:21,096
"Listen, if you travel aimlessly
like this, I'll go home!"

989
02:24:22,254 --> 02:24:29,103
Then go home... if you can.
- You know I won't leave you alone.

990
02:24:30,095 --> 02:24:33,508
That's why you're pestering me.
But I won't listen to you.

991
02:24:34,098 --> 02:24:37,102
Tomorrow I'll detrain at a big
station and take you to a doctor.

992
02:24:37,502 --> 02:24:39,504
This fever is not good.

993
02:24:42,107 --> 02:24:44,713
"Just put off the light, please.
- Okay."

994
02:24:48,113 --> 02:24:50,650
"it's pretty late, so go to sleep."

995
02:25:11,570 --> 02:25:14,414
What's happened to you?
You can't even be recognised.

996
02:25:15,073 --> 02:25:18,418
So what's new?
- That I'm alive.

997
02:25:19,077 --> 02:25:20,647
How come you're here?

998
02:25:20,812 --> 02:25:26,353
"Calcutta didn't suit me, I took
a job in Delhi. I'm going on a tour."

999
02:25:26,751 --> 02:25:29,493
"Here today, there tomorrow.
Where are you going?"

1000
02:25:30,088 --> 02:25:33,558
Not decided as yet.
- Meaning?

1001
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:37,299
There's no meaning to my life now.

1002
02:25:39,331 --> 02:25:41,675
"You are the same Devdas.
Okay, hold on."

1003
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:49,683
We've met after ages.
Why not celebrate? Right?

1004
02:25:50,809 --> 02:25:54,814
"I don't need soda now,
so why waste money on it?"

1005
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,783
But you may find it difficult.
Shall I add some water?

1006
02:25:58,116 --> 02:26:02,394
I've given up drinking.
- Did somebody extract a promise?

1007
02:26:02,821 --> 02:26:06,667
No. I just won't drink.
- But why remove the glass?

1008
02:26:07,058 --> 02:26:12,064
"If not you, I'll drink. Is it the
old ailment, or something new?"

1009
02:26:13,765 --> 02:26:17,474
Why don't you speak?
- What shall I say?

1010
02:26:19,071 --> 02:26:23,417
"l don't like anything.
Now, what I like..."

1011
02:26:23,675 --> 02:26:26,087
is that I don't like anything.

1012
02:26:26,811 --> 02:26:34,093
I know what your sorrow is.
But don't think you're the only one.

1013
02:26:35,587 --> 02:26:40,434
"When this ache convulses the chest,
one has to take support from this."

1014
02:26:42,894 --> 02:26:47,104
Only this can ease that ache.
There's no other solution.

1015
02:27:05,116 --> 02:27:07,062
"Come on, have some more."

1016
02:27:12,190 --> 02:27:15,069
I've to get off here.
I'll leave the bottle for you.

1017
02:27:19,063 --> 02:27:21,373
"If we lie, we'll meet again."

1018
02:27:26,071 --> 02:27:32,420
Why isn't this thirst ever
quenched? This unending thirst.

1019
02:28:07,612 --> 02:28:09,523
What happened?

1020
02:28:12,484 --> 02:28:15,590
You drank liquor again?
Did you?

1021
02:28:16,054 --> 02:28:22,335
I couldn't control myself.
- Your body is so hot!

1022
02:28:22,794 --> 02:28:26,071
"Let's get down here, and
I'll show you to a doctor."

1023
02:28:26,397 --> 02:28:28,070
No!

1024
02:28:28,599 --> 02:28:32,411
Don't stop me.
Let me go on.

1025
02:28:42,514 --> 02:28:47,088
Don't drink now. Didn't the doctor
say it would kill you?

1026
02:28:48,086 --> 02:28:51,090
I'll die even if I don't drink.

1027
02:28:58,196 --> 02:29:00,608
How's the fever?
- What?

1028
02:29:01,099 --> 02:29:04,103
How's the fever?
- Very high.

1029
02:29:10,875 --> 02:29:14,118
What shall I do?
Your fever's not coming down.

1030
02:29:16,114 --> 02:29:20,392
Time has come to go.
- Go where?

1031
02:29:21,185 --> 02:29:24,132
Out of this world.
- Don't say that.

1032
02:29:24,289 --> 02:29:30,296
For God's sake!
- Why do you cry now?

1033
02:29:30,729 --> 02:29:34,142
What else shall I do?
You think I'm heartless.

1034
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:43,150
I beg you. Let's go back.
- Where? To whom?

1035
02:29:44,676 --> 02:29:50,149
I've nobody in this world.
- Nonsense! You've everyone.

1036
02:29:52,584 --> 02:30:00,594
"Everybody's mine, but I'm nobody's.
- Don't say that. I can't bear it."

1037
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:07,273
"We'll get down at Mogulsarai
and go to Kashi, to your mother."

1038
02:30:09,867 --> 02:30:12,871
"Mother?
- Yes, to her."

1039
02:30:14,806 --> 02:30:22,657
"A drunk, characterless soul
like me."

1040
02:30:24,449 --> 02:30:27,123
I won't show my face to her.

1041
02:30:31,122 --> 02:30:37,129
Then let's go back to our village.
- Village? Yes.

1042
02:30:39,730 --> 02:30:46,841
"That'll be good. This broken-body
is from that soil, isn't it?"

1043
02:30:55,146 --> 02:30:58,559
Take me there.

1044
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:19,771
Blood!

1045
02:31:21,572 --> 02:31:24,382
Mother!
- What happened?

1046
02:31:24,876 --> 02:31:27,117
Madam...
- Blood!

1047
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:11,099
"Pardua station. Get down here for
Manekpur, Bhirpur, and Mirganj."

1048
02:32:23,301 --> 02:32:28,717
"If taking care of me will reduce
your sorrow, then I'll come to you"

1049
02:32:30,175 --> 02:32:32,781
I'll come at least once
before I die.

1050
02:33:56,260 --> 02:33:59,730
Hey you!

1051
02:34:03,201 --> 02:34:11,143
Take me to Manekpur?
- It's very far and the road's bad.

1052
02:34:12,777 --> 02:34:17,590
"I won't come in the night.
Sleep here, we'll go tomorrow."

1053
02:34:19,150 --> 02:34:23,690
I don't have that much time.
- Yes?

1054
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:33,106
I must go there.
I'll pay you well.

1055
02:34:33,764 --> 02:34:37,109
"Please take me there.
- Come and sit, sir."

1056
02:34:58,790 --> 02:35:04,536
How much further?
- You've just got in.

1057
02:35:04,863 --> 02:35:07,070
We've a long way to go.

1058
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:14,773
Devdasl...

1059
02:35:20,612 --> 02:35:23,252
"Paro, I'll come back
in my holidays."

1060
02:35:29,153 --> 02:35:31,497
You're so grown up!

1061
02:35:56,580 --> 02:35:59,117
"Where are you going, son?
- Calcutta."

1062
02:36:07,825 --> 02:36:09,827
When will we meet again?

1063
02:36:12,796 --> 02:36:15,402
Give me a place at your feet.

1064
02:36:17,535 --> 02:36:23,611
"Won't this journey ever end?
- Of course it will, sir."

1065
02:37:14,058 --> 02:37:18,734
"Sir, we're in manekpur.
Here's the landlord's house."

1066
02:37:20,464 --> 02:37:22,603
Has he fallen asleep?

1067
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:28,414
"Sir, have you fallen asleep?"

1068
02:37:32,777 --> 02:37:37,089
"We're in Manekpur, sir.
Where do you want to go?"

1069
02:37:42,153 --> 02:37:45,362
"Why don't you answer me?
What's wrong, sir?"

1070
02:37:51,195 --> 02:37:55,371
Paro... I've come.

1071
02:37:58,102 --> 02:38:00,104
I've come.

1072
02:38:03,641 --> 02:38:05,643
"Paro, I'm here.".

1073
02:38:08,046 --> 02:38:09,286
Who is it?

1074
02:38:30,734 --> 02:38:35,080
Why are you standing here?
- Didn't somebody call out to me?

1075
02:38:35,373 --> 02:38:38,377
"Who'll call out to you,
so late at night?"

1076
02:38:39,076 --> 02:38:40,282
Then...

1077
02:38:58,429 --> 02:39:02,377
Not my fault. I refused to come.
Must've caught cold and cough.

1078
02:39:21,618 --> 02:39:29,298
Why such a crowd at the gate?
- A sick traveller is lying there.

1079
02:39:56,821 --> 02:40:00,166
"What is it, Mother?
- Nothing."

1080
02:40:09,099 --> 02:40:13,275
I think you're not well today.
Go upstairs and rest a bit.

1081
02:40:16,807 --> 02:40:21,517
"Must be related to his last birth.
He came here, just to die."

1082
02:40:22,113 --> 02:40:25,788
Where was he from?
- From Talsonapur I hear.

1083
02:40:27,785 --> 02:40:31,460
Who was from Talsonapur?
- A man just died outside.

1084
02:40:31,789 --> 02:40:33,791
He was from that place.
- Do you know his name?

1085
02:40:34,191 --> 02:40:38,139
"No I don't, but your son
may be knowing."

1086
02:40:39,797 --> 02:40:42,801
Who died outside?
- We couldn't find out properly.

1087
02:40:43,434 --> 02:40:47,143
But everyone says it's Devdas
Mukherjee from your village.

1088
02:40:49,273 --> 02:40:52,152
"Who?
- Devdas, from your village."

1089
02:41:00,317 --> 02:41:02,695
How do you know?
- There were 2 letters in his pocket.

1090
02:41:03,154 --> 02:41:05,930
"One to Bijoydas Mukherjee.
- Yes, his elder brother."

1091
02:41:06,290 --> 02:41:08,770
And the other one to Harimati Devi.
- His mother.

1092
02:41:09,226 --> 02:41:12,571
He wore a sapphire-ring.
- From his father! I'm going.

1093
02:41:12,763 --> 02:41:14,868
Where? People must have taken him
to the cremation-ground.

1094
02:41:28,813 --> 02:41:30,121
What happened?
- It's mother.

1095
02:41:30,214 --> 02:41:32,387
Stop her. Has she gone mad?

1096
02:41:39,523 --> 02:41:43,665
"Stop her, son!
Close the gate close it!"

1097
02:42:15,092 --> 02:42:17,436
Dear beloved...
