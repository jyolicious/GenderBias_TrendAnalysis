1
00:00:12,216 --> 00:00:18,950
THE THIRSTY ONE

2
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:19,660
These smiling flowers

3
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:25,163
These fragrant gardens

4
00:02:27,415 --> 00:02:36,204
These paths dipped in color and light

5
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:48,019
These paths dipped in color and light

6
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:06,840
Drinking the nectar of flowers, the bees sway

7
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:15,744
Drinking the nectar of flowers, the bees sway

8
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:31,591
What can I give to you, O splendid nature?

9
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:40,796
All that I have is a few tears, a few sighs

10
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,631
I told you to keep the papers in order.

11
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:48,131
Has a ghost stolen that manuscript?

12
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,683
- Where is the paper? - I... I...

13
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,261
- Good morning. - Good morning.

14
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:56,218
- Did you hear something?
- He wished you good morning.

15
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:59,382
Fool! Where is that manuscript?

16
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,388
Have you looked at my things?

17
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:04,972
Wings?

18
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:06,445
Wings.

19
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:12,187
God forbid! This is a publishing house,
not a birdhouse!

20
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:17,985
Things. Have you read the poems I left?

21
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,217
I have.

22
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,800
Did you like them? You'll publish them?

23
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,731
Why? Am I crazy?

24
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,101
Call that poetry? It's a crusade
against hunger and unemployment.

25
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:35,283
Sir, poetry deals with delicacies.

26
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,076
Write poems about flowers and songbirds.

27
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:40,286
You're incomparable, sir!

28
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,708
Write about wine and the carafe...

29
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:49,713
the delicate neck of the carafe,
the curve of a woman's eyebrow.

30
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,256
Be quiet! Are you a poet or a barber?

31
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:55,169
Have you studied poets like Mir and Momin?

32
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:56,857
Have you?

33
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:02,841
Josh and Faiz, too. Beyond your
comprehension. Return my poems.

34
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,404
They must be somewhere. We'll find them later.

35
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:17,310
You're making a mess of my papers.
Are you mad?

36
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,133
What is this? Oh no.

37
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:21,841
...

38
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,605
So that's where my poems were.
Who are you to throw them away?

39
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:31,900
Should I make a paper hat of them?

40
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,861
Don't insult them by wearing them
on a hollow head.

41
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,660
- So my head is hollow? - Yes.

42
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,984
How about yours?
If you're a poet, I'm a donkey!

43
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:48,638
Obviously, but it's nice to hear you admit it.

44
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:05,712
Are you weighing vegetables or gold?
Add another eggplant.

45
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,079
Come on.

46
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,174
Grandma, there's Uncle Vijay

47
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,923
Vijay. Here's you money.

48
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,402
- Uncle. - Vijay.

49
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:23,913
- Uncle. - Vijay.

50
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:32,510
Vijay.

51
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:34,729
Grandma, hurry up.

52
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,732
I've caught Uncle.

53
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:54,457
I'm not your enemy. Why run from your mother?

54
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,647
- Mom I...
- Son, where have you been all these days?

55
00:06:57,828 --> 00:07:02,073
You lost your father.
I can't bear to see you suffer.

56
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,068
I'm well, mother.

57
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:09,209
Of course! Just look at the state you're in.

58
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:16,768
Come home. I've hidden away
some special food for you.

59
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:18,552
Come my son.

60
00:07:18,632 --> 00:07:20,792
You've found him?

61
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:22,879
Yes.

62
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,265
Come my son.

63
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,382
Vijay had such a promising future.
Look at him now.

64
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,865
I hear poetry has obsessed him.

65
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,140
Take no notice of them. Eat.

66
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,443
So your poet is back?

67
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:00,079
Every literate donkey thinks he's a poet.

68
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,058
Brother.

69
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,909
Where else can he go? Who will feed him?

70
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,661
Don't listen to him. Eat.

71
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:20,336
See, brother? We earn and mother
feeds delicacies to her darling son.

72
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,337
His lack of shame amazes me.

73
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:29,425
If he had any self-respect,
he'd starve rather than eat here.

74
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:39,216
Shut up, you two!
I won't hear a word said against him.

75
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,017
He's back after so long, thirsty
and hungry, and you begrudge him.

76
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:50,088
He's hale and hearty. Why doesn't
he earn his keep? Depending on us.

77
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:55,221
He's your brother. After father
died you should look after him.

78
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:58,930
Father has gone and with him his duty.

79
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:02,392
It wasn't our wish that our parents
produced such a good-for-nothing.

80
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:03,738
...

81
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:05,400
What?

82
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,178
That I should have to hear this.

83
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,055
It was my misfortune to give birth to you two.

84
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:18,004
You won't let me work as a maid
because of your "prestige."

85
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,270
I would do that to feed my son.

86
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:27,862
...

87
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:30,986
Sister-in-law, where are my poems?

88
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:34,500
Address me, not the women.

89
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,204
I sold them as waste paper for ten annas.

90
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:52,204
Ten annas? You sold my poems as waste paper?

91
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:57,422
Uncouth fools like you know no better.

92
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:03,252
You call me uncouth?
Did you hear that, brother?

93
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:10,447
How dare you? I got rid of your papers,
now I'll get rid of you!

94
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,692
Out! Useless!

95
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:26,641
Where will you go on an empty stomach?
Who will look after you?

96
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:33,645
Take me with you. I don't want to
stay in this house another minute

97
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:38,856
Don't worry, mother. I'll do my best.

98
00:10:40,315 --> 00:10:45,401
I'll take you away from here as soon as I can.

99
00:10:54,464 --> 00:10:59,369
Vijay, let me get on with my work
instead of searching waste paper.

100
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,871
There was an important file
among that waste paper.

101
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,748
A file? Handwritten papers?

102
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,376
- Where are they? - A woman bought them.

103
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:12,692
What?

104
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,641
They caught her eye, she read some,
then she took them away.

105
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:21,089
Who is she? Where does she live?

106
00:11:21,257 --> 00:11:24,425
How do I know? She wasn't a local person.

107
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,834
Vijay, if she comes again, I'll ask.

108
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:53,179
Come in. Were your brothers
as affectionate as ever?

109
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,905
Hungry? You'll end up starving to death.

110
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,740
As for me, I got 200 rupees
from a rich man today.

111
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:05,598
How?

112
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,336
He ran over an old woman's leg,
but I gave false witness for him.

113
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:17,160
Shyam, remember how you found
a lamed sparrow as a kid?

114
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:22,127
You cared for it until it was better.

115
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,127
I was only a kid then.

116
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,525
But you're still the kid.

117
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:31,078
...

118
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:50,903
Do not complain if I look at you
with impudence.

119
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:53,765
There!

120
00:13:54,307 --> 00:14:02,305
You looked at me again with such longing.

121
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:07,247
- You looked at me again... - Listen.

122
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:14,962
I say...

123
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:20,322
Who knows what you said?

124
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,491
Who knows what I heard?

125
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:28,952
Something stirred in my heart

126
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,917
Who knows what you said?

127
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:37,146
Who knows what I heard?

128
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:41,409
Something stirred in my heart

129
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:44,901
Who knows what you said?

130
00:14:45,362 --> 00:15:09,668
...

131
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:13,711
I heard a ringing sound

132
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:17,423
I felt a tingling sensation

133
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:22,026
I heard a ringing sound

134
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:25,438
I felt a tingling sensation

135
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:29,488
Slumbering dreams reawakened

136
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:33,199
Something stirred in my heart

137
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,896
Who knows what you said?

138
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:42,143
Who knows what I heard?

139
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:46,333
Something stirred in my heart

140
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:49,729
Who knows what you said?

141
00:15:49,809 --> 00:16:11,588
...

142
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,456
My lowered eyes looked up again

143
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,306
My faltering feet are steady now

144
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:23,707
My lowered eyes looked up again

145
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:27,644
My faltering feet are steady now

146
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,359
There is new life in my step

147
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,735
Something stirred in my heart

148
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:39,738
Who knows what you said?

149
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:43,709
Who knows what I heard?

150
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:47,625
Something stirred in my heart

151
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,196
Who knows what you said?

152
00:16:51,575 --> 00:17:21,000
...

153
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:24,391
My hair floats around my shoulders...

154
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:28,525
filled with sweet fragrance

155
00:17:29,024 --> 00:17:32,591
My hair floats around my shoulders...

156
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:36,303
filled with sweet fragrance

157
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,885
Secret longings unravel

158
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,081
Something stirred in my heart

159
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:47,965
Who knows what you said?

160
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:52,182
Who knows what I heard?

161
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:56,272
Something stirred in my heart

162
00:17:56,353 --> 00:18:00,025
Who knows what you said?

163
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:04,052
Who knows what I heard?

164
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,924
Something stirred in my heart

165
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:11,365
Who knows what you said?

166
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:19,476
...

167
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,635
- Listen. - Yes?

168
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:29,805
- That song you were singing...
- Did you like it?

169
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:31,848
Where did you get it?

170
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,335
It's mine.

171
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,299
...

172
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:40,774
- It isn't yours. - Then why ask, if you know?

173
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:41,902
Because I want...

174
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,418
What do you want?

175
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,961
The file with that song in it.

176
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:51,903
Is that all?

177
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:55,155
I don't like absurd jokes.

178
00:18:57,444 --> 00:18:58,397
Do you like me?

179
00:18:58,557 --> 00:18:59,321
...

180
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,159
No.

181
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:06,216
Then why are you following me?

182
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:11,879
If you have that file, it's precious
to me. Whenever I have money...

183
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:17,275
You've followed me empty-handed?
You think this is your family home?

184
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,337
Get out!

185
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,668
Please understand.

186
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:21,480
I only want that file.

187
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,956
- Remove your hand. - It's very important.

188
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,157
Get out!

189
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:27,455
Must I kick you out?

190
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:40,356
Stop shouting, silly.
Your new customer will run away.

191
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:44,785
A pauper! I lured him here,
but he hasn't a penny.

192
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,524
Juhi, it was him.

193
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:16,338
Gulabo, what's come over you?
Where are you running?

194
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:20,991
I must apologize to him.
I treated him very badly.

195
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:38,135
Stop talking in riddles.
Speak in plain language.

196
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:41,458
What's all this about?

197
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:46,961
The man who followed me is a poet.

198
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:52,024
The poet whose poems I bought as waste paper.

199
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:56,103
Look: the same writing, the same paper.

200
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:59,899
And I threw him out as a pauper

201
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,543
He is a pauper

202
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:09,234
If you hadn't thrown him out,
would you prefer hugging him?

203
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,808
Our profession has its standards

204
00:21:13,236 --> 00:21:14,893
Let's go back upstairs

205
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,101
...

206
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:17,116
...

207
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,078
It's fun

208
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,086
...

209
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,305
Hello

210
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,735
They are very bad boys

211
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:33,033
Vijay, have you written any poems
in the holidays?

212
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,429
A few

213
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:41,558
Create something extempore,
then we'll consider you a poet

214
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:44,661
Extempore?

215
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,792
- Shall I?
- Yes

216
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:52,140
Shall I? On what subject?

217
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,129
Which subject?

218
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,083
Who is she?

219
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:03,670
Who cares? There's your subject:
a poem about her

220
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:12,366
When I walk, even my shadow
lags behind

221
00:23:15,843 --> 00:23:17,419
When you walk...

222
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,557
the earth and the sky keep pace

223
00:23:21,758 --> 00:23:26,106
When I stop, a lonely evening
falls upon me

224
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:32,402
When you stop, spring and
moonlight stop too

225
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:35,035
...

226
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,908
Learning your poetry lesson, Vijay?

227
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,579
Yes sir. I mean no sir

228
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,031
Sit down

229
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,139
- Mr. David
- Present sir

230
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,141
- Miss Shobha
- Present sir

231
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:08,489
Miss Pushpalata

232
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,236
Miss Pushpalata

233
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:14,028
Present sir. I am here

234
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:16,547
Oh, sorry

235
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:28,362
...

236
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:07,937
...

237
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,106
...

238
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:11,716
Miss Sinha. Miss Sinha

239
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,451
Present sir

240
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:19,663
...

241
00:25:53,938 --> 00:26:00,292
Life may present us with many
trials, but we will never part

242
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:04,540
...

243
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,489
Never break our vow of love,
even if Judgement Day is upon us

244
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:18,053
Life may present us with many
trials, but we will never part

245
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:24,977
Never break our vow of love,
even if Judgement Day is upon us

246
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:33,134
We leave the world behind,
advancing step by step

247
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:39,029
Who knows how long we will travel
together as carefree as we are?

248
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:55,562
...

249
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:29,895
Coolie!

250
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:33,519
Coolie!

251
00:27:38,516 --> 00:27:39,815
I want a coolie!

252
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,195
At your service

253
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,482
What?

254
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:55,104
God! What has the world come to?
Educated people working as coolies

255
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:58,635
Fine

256
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,130
Here you money

257
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:10,281
...

258
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,101
Have you brought money today?

259
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,798
No credit

260
00:28:35,238 --> 00:28:35,903
...

261
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:42,996
It's counterfeit

262
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:53,704
What?

263
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:56,557
I suppose you've got nothing else?

264
00:28:59,081 --> 00:29:00,509
So that's your game!

265
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,487
You brought the counterfeit
money on purpose.

266
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:05,359
Who'll pay for the food
you've eaten?

267
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:08,537
Pay up, or I'll have your shirt

268
00:29:08,774 --> 00:29:10,287
Take the plate away

269
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,398
Put it back

270
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:17,237
Take your money

271
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:22,966
Keep the change; go to a barber.
He'll make you look more like a human

272
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:24,318
Move it!

273
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,631
Why don't you eat?

274
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:42,275
- I'm not hungry
- Yes, you are

275
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:44,373
You've no right to pity me

276
00:29:53,113 --> 00:29:58,890
I'm sorry... don't let my anger
offend you

277
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:03,301
You have every right to be angry

278
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:07,988
I treated you very badly
the other day

279
00:30:10,073 --> 00:30:11,241
I've nothing against you

280
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:18,014
Then please eat... for my sake

281
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:23,789
For your sake?

282
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:29,154
You hardly know me

283
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:31,628
I know you very well

284
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,524
How?

285
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,840
Through your poems and songs

286
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:40,124
I know your thoughts and feelings

287
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:42,547
What else is there?

288
00:30:45,197 --> 00:30:47,013
I can't understand you

289
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,705
The other day, Miss...

290
00:30:53,202 --> 00:30:59,162
Why do you address me so politely?
It seems strange

291
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:00,818
Why?

292
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,525
Until today, I have only heard
people rebuke me

293
00:31:08,777 --> 00:31:10,272
Their crude remarks...

294
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:12,143
their taunts...

295
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:17,365
their abuse, their dirty jokes

296
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:22,788
But you show me so much respect

297
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:59,224
Massage, oil massage,
head massage

298
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:04,191
Massage, oil massage,
head massage

299
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:27,564
Massage, oil massage,
head massage

300
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:32,951
If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom

301
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:41,336
Don't fret, leave it to me,
I'll make things right soon

302
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:43,932
Massage, oil massage

303
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:48,865
If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom

304
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:56,728
Don't fret, leave it to me,
I'll make things right soon

305
00:32:57,151 --> 00:33:10,188
...

306
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:15,603
The oil I use has perfume,
curing baldness and dandruff

307
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:20,158
Once my hands begin to whirl,
your fate won't look so rough

308
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:25,523
The oil I use has perfume,
curing baldness and dandruff

309
00:33:26,216 --> 00:33:30,867
Once my hands begin to whirl,
your fate won't look so rough

310
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:36,664
Listen to me, my son.
This oil has great healing powers

311
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,802
Listen to me, my son.
This oil has great healing powers

Don't fret, leave it to me,

315
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:20,811
...

316
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:26,031
Suffering a lovers' tiff?
Is your business in the throes?

317
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:31,063
A single touch of this strong hand

318

Don't fret, leave it to me,

325
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:32,252
...

326
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:37,020
Be you a servant, be you a master.
Be you a leader, or one of the led

327
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:42,315
Come to me, as everyone does;
king or soldier, bow your head

328
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:48,060
Be you a servant, be you a master.
Be you a leader, or one of the led

329
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:52,962
Come to me, as everyone does;
king or soldier, bow your head

It cures a thousand ailments,
so why not give it a try?

333

Don't fret, leave it to me,
I'll make things right soon

335
00:36:28,044 --> 00:36:29,969
Mr Vijay, come here!

336
00:36:30,802 --> 00:36:35,162
A great poet. I was singing
one of his songs

337
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:40,927
Business has doubled since
I've been singing your song

338
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:42,552
- Really?
- Yes

339
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,840
Don't go

340
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:46,436
- I'll just finish him off
- What?

341
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:47,909
Stay put

342
00:36:48,178 --> 00:36:53,274
Mr Vijay, I'll give you a special
massage, completely free

343
00:36:54,345 --> 00:37:00,486
No, Sattar. The present times
have battered me quite enough

344
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:05,790
It's amazing how you still manage
to smile, despite the battering

345
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:08,992
I've seen only two blissfully
unaware creatures

346
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,837
A donkey in the noon sun
and a starving poet

347
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:16,066
True. The heat may come from
the glitter of gold or the sun

348
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:18,288
Only donkeys relish it

349
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:22,890
- What did you say?
- Still! We're discussing donkeys

350
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:38,345
...

351
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,229
...

352
00:37:57,397 --> 00:37:58,957
Here I am

353
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,668
...

354
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:08,986
- Juhi, weren't you waiting for me?
- I'm waiting for a man with a car

355
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,076
With a car? Not a masseur?

356
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:14,379
- No!
- No?

357
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:19,065
- May Allah puncture his tyres
- May He puncture your head

358
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,227
My?

359
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:27,707
- Juhi, are you cross with me?
- Out with it

360
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:31,250
You get upset when I speak of
the man with the car

361
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:34,297
Have you no consideration for
the heart you've punctured?

362
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:38,911
- Get it patched up
- I have no wife to patch it

363
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,932
- What do I care about it?
- Let's get married

364
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:43,924
Get lost, you idiot!

365
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:48,843
Did You hear? You gave me
the gift of massaging

366
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:52,470
If I had the gift of cheating,
I'd be the one driving her around

367
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,515
I'm done for! What hit me?

368
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:01,265
A coconut? I get it.
I won't say another word

369
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,690
Phullu! Stop! Brother, don't
let him escape. Stop him

370
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:13,150
If you let him go,
I'll have to chase him for a mile

371
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:17,445
I'm half my size,
thanks to chasing these boys

372
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,237
Hello, Pushpa

373
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:24,379
Vijay? I didn't recognize you

374
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:29,451
You were smartly dressed at college.
Whose "love" brought you to this?

375
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,502
Someone who won't let me go.

376
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:34,710
- Who?
- Unemployment

377
00:39:36,247 --> 00:39:37,763
Are these children yours?

378
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,750
And their father's.
They're Gullu and Phullu

379
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:44,333
Their father's name
rhymes with theirs

380
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:45,941
- Rhymes with theirs?
- Yes

381
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:51,212
There's a gathering at our old
college tonight

382
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,965
All our classmates will be there.
You must come

383
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:59,015
Gullu, wait

384
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:01,680
Now for another mile race

385
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:03,453
I'll leave. Gullu!

386
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:07,217
What are you doing here?
Come on

387
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,641
You must come tonight.
Don't forget

388
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:13,524
Gullu, wait.

389
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,328
Leaving the world behind,
advancing step by step

390
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,333
Who knows where we're heading,
as carefree as we are

391
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,416
Leaving the world behind,
advancing step by step

392
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:41,738
Where is Bhattacharya?
He was going to recite next

393
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:43,600
Oh, God! Yes!

394
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,153
Leaving the world behind,
advancing step by step

395
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,825
Vijay, why stand here, peeping in?
Come inside

396
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,035
No, Pushpa. My clothes...

397
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,189
Clothes? You're covered from
head to foot. Come along

398
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,842
Move a side

399
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,117
Come

400
00:41:08,815 --> 00:41:10,860
Come

401
00:41:13,836 --> 00:41:15,631
Ladies and gentlemen

402
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:19,049
Mr Bhattacharya isn't here.
Well, we're delighted...

403
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:20,386
...

404
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:23,926
we're delighted that
Vijay is here...

405
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:27,433
and I request him to
recite one of his poems

406
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:29,987
Come Mr. Vijay. Come

407
00:41:30,264 --> 00:41:32,249
Don't be formal

408
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:53,450
Start, Vijay

409
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:57,885
Start, Vijay

410
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,661
I am weary...

411
00:42:06,236 --> 00:42:12,330
I am weary of the struggle of life

412
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:16,350
I am weary...

413
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:22,883
I am weary of the struggle of life

414
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:29,924
The weariness of my heart
may spurn the world

415
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:35,011
Why such a sad song on this occasion?
Recite a happy verse

416
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:45,100
Afflicted by grief,
how do I find a song of joy?

417
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:50,479
How do I find a song of joy?

418
00:42:51,479 --> 00:43:00,247
I can only return to this life
what it has given to me

419
00:43:00,768 --> 00:43:09,909
I can only return to this life
what it has given to me

420
00:43:11,367 --> 00:43:23,874
The desires of the heart
are stirred once again

421
00:43:24,524 --> 00:43:33,687
I confess that I have been
crushed by life's sorrows

422
00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:43,337
I confess that I have been
crushed by life's sorrows

423
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:52,705
There! Today I break...

424
00:43:53,256 --> 00:44:07,017
There! Today I break
all ties with hope

425
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:16,309
There! Never shall I voice
a complaint again

426
00:44:16,816 --> 00:44:25,524
There! Never shall I voice
a complaint again

427
00:44:43,195 --> 00:44:47,101
Are you an ex-student?

428
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,745
- Yes
- I see

429
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:54,188
Do you work?

430
00:44:56,356 --> 00:44:57,982
I spend my time looking for work

431
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:01,875
Your poems are good

432
00:45:03,695 --> 00:45:05,057
Thanks

433
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:10,741
My card. Come to my office
tomorrow morning

434
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,351
Modern Publishing House.

435
00:45:17,585 --> 00:45:19,078
- Yourself?
- I am the owner

436
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:30,447
- Greetings, Mr. Ghosh!
- Have a seat

437
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:33,378
Here are my poems

438
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:39,799
- When were you at college?
- From '48 to '52

439
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:43,176
Shall I read the poems aloud,
or will you read them?

440
00:45:44,111 --> 00:45:45,647
1952.

441
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:52,890
I married in 1952

442
00:45:54,641 --> 00:45:57,080
Did you study science or arts?

443
00:45:58,779 --> 00:45:59,828
Arts

444
00:46:01,187 --> 00:46:02,228
May I recite the poems?

445
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,025
You're sure you left college in '52,
or was it before?

446
00:46:11,131 --> 00:46:11,984
In '52

447
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:14,948
In '52. Mr. Ghosh, my poems?

448
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:16,855
Will you work in my office?

449
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:20,283
Work here?

450
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,702
I thought you called me about
publishing my poems

451
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:29,760
There's plenty of time
to publish your poems

452
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:33,372
I must find out more about you

453
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,166
About me?

454
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:38,433
Yes

455
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:41,795
Mr Chatterji, this is your
new assistant

456
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:44,838
You can start tomorrow

457
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,406
- Farewell!
- Farewell!

458
00:47:02,711 --> 00:47:03,618
...

459
00:47:16,104 --> 00:47:17,013
Hello, Meena

460
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:26,631
Vijay

461
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:28,089
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

462
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:34,904
What if I close my eyes
and punish your heart?

463
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:42,217
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

464
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:49,216
What if I close my eyes
and punish your heart?

465
00:49:49,497 --> 00:49:56,182
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

466
00:49:56,571 --> 00:50:11,904
...

467
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:19,031
I will weave flowers of love
in your hair

468
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:25,615
What if I were to shake
the flowers to the ground?

469
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:32,948
I will weave flowers of love
in your hair

470
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:39,854
What if I were to shake
the flowers to the ground?

471
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:46,707
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

472
00:50:47,114 --> 00:51:02,642
...

473
00:51:02,722 --> 00:51:09,627
I will bring you into my dreams
and tease you

474
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:16,595
What if I were to rob your eyes
of sleep?

475
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:23,658
I will bring you into my dreams
and tease you

476
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:30,765
What if I were to rob your eyes
of sleep?

477
00:51:30,949 --> 00:51:37,753
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

478
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:53,589
...

479
00:51:53,670 --> 00:52:00,635
I will lay my heart at your feet,
swooning

480
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:07,721
What if I still won't comfort you
in any way?

481
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:14,676
I will lay my heart at your feet,
swooning

482
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:21,507
What if I still won't comfort you
in any way?

483
00:52:21,586 --> 00:52:28,549
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

484
00:52:28,842 --> 00:52:35,570
What if I close my eyes
and punish your heart?

485
00:52:35,842 --> 00:52:43,024
What if my heart were to
dwell in your eyes?

486
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:12,397
- How have you been?
- I'm alive

487
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:19,928
- I would love to see you happy
- Thank you

488
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:25,904
Don't worry, I have learnt
how to be happy

489
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,075
Has another girl been teaching you?

490
00:54:30,117 --> 00:54:34,679
Another girl? One was enough
for a lifetime

491
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,909
I don't want such suffering again

492
00:54:39,747 --> 00:54:43,292
You mean you have erased
your first love?

493
00:54:44,011 --> 00:54:45,381
I should have

494
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:47,903
...

495
00:54:51,161 --> 00:54:56,091
I completely forgot...
I was going up

496
00:55:31,172 --> 00:55:36,407
Lady, won't you let us close?
Three hours you've waited

497
00:55:36,797 --> 00:55:38,033
Who for?

498
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:58,900
Does Mr Vijay come here often?

499
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,048
He did, but not lately.
Any message for him?

500
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:18,055
Why whisper sweetly to the boy?
I am here, too

501
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:24,060
Have you found them?
What do you think?

502
00:56:24,436 --> 00:56:26,603
Vijay calls them his poetry

503
00:56:26,979 --> 00:56:30,355
I've read them, they're fine poems

504
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:32,112
OK

505
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:34,491
Why not publish a few?

506
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:38,027
- Are you mad?
- What?

507
00:56:38,558 --> 00:56:44,063
You should know we publish famous
poets, not the trash of novices

508
00:56:44,982 --> 00:56:47,156
Fill the blank space with
a soap advertisement

509
00:56:54,427 --> 00:56:55,420
Yes, Vijay?

510
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:58,248
What do you want?

511
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:04,281
Yes. This trash of a novice...

512
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,545
may I take it away?

513
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:10,729
Sure

514
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,619
- Vijay
- Yes

515
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:22,971
Are you free tomorrow evening?

516
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,084
Yes

517
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:29,598
Come and lend a hand at
a party in my house

518
00:57:31,475 --> 00:57:32,264
I'll be there

519
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:35,752
...

520
00:57:53,489 --> 00:57:55,226
- Did you see that, Juhi?
- What?

521
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:56,589
What I am observing

522
00:57:56,669 --> 00:57:57,567
What do you see?

523
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:03,700
You see but you refuse to

524
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:06,364
All I see if your silly face

525
00:58:06,534 --> 00:58:07,508
Really?

526
00:58:07,748 --> 00:58:08,624
Keep looking!

527
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,170
- Did your heart miss a beat?
- Yes

528
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:14,765
Let it race a little more

529
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:19,481
- My heart is getting confused
- Confused? Or stirred?

530
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:21,615
No way!

531
00:58:22,888 --> 00:58:24,067
No?

532
00:58:30,558 --> 00:58:33,474
Juhi, be cross with me
as much as you like...

533
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:37,683
but who will care for you
in your old age?

534
00:58:38,434 --> 00:58:39,226
God will

535
00:58:39,306 --> 00:58:44,061
Don't talk of Him, or a coconut
will fall on your head

536
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:47,855
If you want a secure future,
listen to me

537
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:51,816
If I listen to you,
I'll starve to death

538
00:58:53,038 --> 00:58:57,027
You barely feed yourself,
how can you feed me?

539
00:58:57,528 --> 00:59:01,613
You can have my share

540
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,281
My hunger will be satisfied
just by seeing you in my home

541
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:08,743
- Really, Sattar?
- Abdul Sattar

542
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:12,486
Abdul Sattar, do you love me
that much?

543
00:59:14,877 --> 00:59:16,163
When do we marry?

544
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:18,004
Stop, you idiot!

545
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,459
Did You hear that? No, nothing

546
00:59:25,919 --> 00:59:26,970
No coconut

547
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,089
Where is your husband?

548
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:35,234
He's unwell. He wanted me to take
him to hospital, but I put it off

549
00:59:35,688 --> 00:59:37,594
How could I miss such a party?

550
00:59:37,826 --> 00:59:38,650
...

551
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:41,412
Thank you. How kind of you

552
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,518
Haven't you brought your son?

553
00:59:49,598 --> 00:59:50,532
No

554
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,550
Vijay

555
00:59:57,246 --> 00:59:58,772
How did you find my address?

556
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:04,068
Your address? Do you live here?

557
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:06,444
Yes. Let's go outside

558
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:10,197
Mr Ghosh told me to come

559
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:15,074
Do you know him?

560
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:19,828
I work for him. And you?

561
01:00:21,227 --> 01:00:22,924
I am his...

562
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:26,126
Who is the most talented poet here?

563
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:32,627
All are good, but the man
in the black jacket...

564
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:42,969
Don't tell him about us.
Understand?

565
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:45,343
He's considered to be
the greatest of poets

566
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:50,130
Excuse me

567
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:52,152
I disagree

568
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:57,224
Poetry about the nation's progress
is better than empty love poems

569
01:00:58,517 --> 01:01:04,187
Gentlemen, stop this argument for
once; the drinks are here

570
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:10,065
Don't bother, dear.
What are servants for?

571
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:13,224
Vijay.

572
01:01:13,652 --> 01:01:15,636
Why are you waiting? Serve

573
01:01:27,827 --> 01:01:31,829
How could I tell her of
my sad story of love?

574
01:01:31,995 --> 01:01:35,832
What would I say?
How would I say it?

575
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:39,750
Not a word escaped my lips

576
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:43,165
And tears welled in my eyes

577
01:01:43,247 --> 01:01:44,788
Wonderful! Wow!

578
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:48,586
In the assembly of the ecstatic

579
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:52,467
In the gathering of the discerning

580
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,261
As they sat clasping
the cup of wine

581
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,345
I quaffed the wine,
I spilled drops, too

582
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:03,535
As they sat clasping
the cup of wine

583
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:06,997
I quaffed the wine,
I spilled drops, too

584
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:10,231
- Wonderful! Wow!
- Well said!

585
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:16,429
The disquiet of my feelings
came to my rescue at last

586
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:22,962
Perceiving my distressed state,
at last she deigned to love me

587
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:27,776
- Wonderful! Wow!
- Well said!

588
01:02:29,214 --> 01:02:36,040
Who are the fortunate ones...

589
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:40,691
who love and are loved
in return?

590
01:02:42,984 --> 01:02:48,403
What an appreciative house!
Even your servants are poets

591
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:51,836
I'll see to the food

592
01:02:52,459 --> 01:02:55,669
Poetry is not the sole prerogative
of the rich

593
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:01,310
What were you saying, sir?
Why so silent? Pray continue

594
01:03:02,444 --> 01:03:07,761
Who are the fortunate ones...

595
01:03:07,928 --> 01:03:11,746
who love and are loved
in return?

596
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:23,300
When I asked for flowers,
I was given a garland of thorns

597
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:29,024
Who are the fortunate ones...

598
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:33,277
who love and are loved
in return?

599
01:03:34,172 --> 01:03:41,932
...

600
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,202
When I searched for a world
of happiness...

601
01:03:47,445 --> 01:03:52,247
a forlorn, dusty path
lay before me

602
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:57,732
When I searched for a world
of happiness...

603
01:03:57,916 --> 01:04:02,557
a forlorn, dusty path
lay before me

604
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:08,268
When I sought songs of desire...

605
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:12,132
frozen sighs were offered to me

606
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:21,846
The ones who consoled me only
redoubled my heart's burdens

607
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:34,016
When I asked for flowers,
I was given a garland of thorns

608
01:04:34,491 --> 01:04:44,197
Who are the fortunate ones
who love and are loved in return?

609
01:04:44,537 --> 01:04:52,410
...

610
01:04:52,492 --> 01:05:00,286
Parted from me...

611
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:12,419
Companions parted from me,
having shared fleeting moments

612
01:05:13,436 --> 01:05:22,705
Who has the time to clasp
a pining lover's hand?

613
01:05:23,635 --> 01:05:32,015
I have found my shadow
often weary of me

614
01:05:33,868 --> 01:05:43,938
When I asked for flowers,
I was given a garland of thorns

615
01:05:44,522 --> 01:05:53,986
Who are the fortunate ones
who love and are loved in return?

616
01:05:54,672 --> 01:06:02,214
...

617
01:06:02,386 --> 01:06:12,497
If this is called living,
then I'll live my life somehow

618
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:22,547
If this is called living,
then I'll live my life somehow

619
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:28,174
I will not complain,
I'll seal my lips

620
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:32,842
I'll swallow my tears

621
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:42,372
Why would I fear sorrow when
I encounter it countless times?

622
01:06:43,955 --> 01:06:54,124
When I asked for flowers,
I was given a garland of thorns

623
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:59,317
Who are the fortunate ones...

624
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:03,444
who love and are loved
in return?

625
01:07:05,644 --> 01:07:08,682
Wonderful! Excellent!

626
01:07:11,438 --> 01:07:12,845
What were you saying?

627
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:26,062
...

628
01:07:34,328 --> 01:07:35,995
I have come to see you

629
01:07:41,912 --> 01:07:43,047
Yes

630
01:07:44,709 --> 01:07:48,586
Mr Ghosh has gone to the
board meeting

631
01:07:49,752 --> 01:07:51,460
You shouldn't have come

632
01:07:56,455 --> 01:07:59,884
I have been very upset
since the party

633
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:03,511
You bear me many grudges,
don't you?

634
01:08:04,472 --> 01:08:09,390
No, Meena. I bear no grudge
against anyone

635
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:19,687
So why did you sing that
heart-rending poem?

636
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:24,239
...

637
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:28,623
You revived my desires

638
01:08:29,136 --> 01:08:30,560
Forget the past, Meena

639
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:34,531
I was trying to forget

640
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:40,951
I had remoulded my life.
I had controlled my heart

641
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:49,415
Why return to my life?

642
01:08:50,122 --> 01:08:55,334
When did I ever leave your life?
You left me

643
01:08:56,795 --> 01:09:01,337
Do not try to correct
your first mistake...

644
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:03,925
with another mistake, Meena

645
01:09:04,256 --> 01:09:05,799
I made no mistake

646
01:09:06,966 --> 01:09:11,758
Besides love, a sensible woman
needs the comfort of a home

647
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,638
She needs a little wealth

648
01:09:16,368 --> 01:09:18,057
For those things I...

649
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:24,075
You married Mr Ghosh.
Selling your love for wealth

650
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,060
Don't accuse me wrongly

651
01:09:28,437 --> 01:09:33,024
I loved you, but you were poor
and unemployed

652
01:09:34,024 --> 01:09:38,527
In life, besides poetry and love
there is hunger, too

653
01:09:39,361 --> 01:09:44,363
When you couldn't feed yourself
how could you bear my burden?

654
01:09:44,907 --> 01:09:46,698
You never gave me the chance

655
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:52,076
When a man has responsibilities,
he learns to shoulder them

656
01:09:52,618 --> 01:09:58,414
Don't deceive yourself, Meena;
you sought wealth and position

657
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,541
You wanted standing in the world

658
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:07,044
You have all that now, but you
regret it all. You know why?

659
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:12,130
Because you have always been
selfish

660
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:16,759
You left without caring
how unhappy I would be

661
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:22,220
And now you want your husband
to be unhappy

662
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:33,393
Life's real joy is found in
making others happy

663
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:39,167
You never understood that;
that's why you're unhappy

664
01:10:50,526 --> 01:10:51,406
...

665
01:10:53,738 --> 01:10:57,993
Wonderful! My wife's no better
than a streetwalker

666
01:10:58,241 --> 01:11:01,744
You misunderstand. Vijay and I
hardly know each other

667
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:04,207
Stop fooling me!
How long has this been going on?

668
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:07,095
- I hardly know him
- Is that so?

669
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:07,780
Yes

670
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:09,115
...

671
01:11:09,893 --> 01:11:15,897
If you won't admit it, let's see
how upset you are when I sack him

672
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,368
...

673
01:11:31,274 --> 01:11:35,348
- Give me my money
- I earn my money the hard way

674
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:37,474
Scoundrel! Pay up

675
01:11:37,728 --> 01:11:38,903
Scoundrel?

676
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:40,516
Constable!

677
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:49,298
...

678
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,481
Save me, do something

679
01:12:33,173 --> 01:12:36,593
You? What's wrong?

680
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:39,755
You!

681
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:43,472
Sir, has a girl run this way?

682
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,055
No

683
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:46,908
Who is she?

684
01:12:49,476 --> 01:12:50,602
My wife

685
01:12:53,644 --> 01:12:55,979
Sorry, sir, I made a mistake

686
01:12:59,856 --> 01:13:01,190
What's your name?

687
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:03,286
You...

688
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:06,569
Gulab

689
01:13:07,612 --> 01:13:11,477
It's all clear now.
You can go safely

690
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:38,200
O friends!

691
01:13:39,588 --> 01:13:48,553
Having endured the torment
of a long separation

692
01:13:49,879 --> 01:14:00,006
Radha was overcome
with weariness

693
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:12,187
So one day she went to
her enchanting Krishna...

694
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:21,394
and she said:

695
01:14:27,194 --> 01:14:36,497
Today, beloved, hold me in Your
arms, my life will be fulfilled

696
01:14:37,248 --> 01:14:46,267
Today, beloved, hold me in Your
arms, my life will be fulfilled

697
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:56,272
Ease the ache in my heart,
cool the fire in my body

698
01:14:57,285 --> 01:15:06,182
Today, beloved, hold me in Your
arms, my life will be fulfilled

699
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:27,423
...

700
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:35,976
My hapless eyes have been
sleepless for countless years

701
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:41,708
My hapless eyes have been
sleepless for countless years

702
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:45,790
Without You,
no place pleases me

703
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:53,297
I see no happiness ahead

704
01:15:53,377 --> 01:16:00,504
Sorrow follows me everywhere.
Without You, the world is lonely

705
01:16:01,065 --> 01:16:08,379
O my beloved, the nectar of love

706
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:16,372
O my beloved...

707
01:16:16,818 --> 01:16:24,688
Let the nectar of love overflow,
so the world floods with feeling

708
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:34,516
Today, beloved, hold me in Your
arms, my life will be fulfilled

709
01:16:35,118 --> 01:16:48,315
...

710
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:56,502
Make me Your own

711
01:16:56,583 --> 01:17:02,835
Take me in Your arms. I have
been born again and again to serve You

712
01:17:03,263 --> 01:17:05,452
Make me Your own

713
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:12,186
Take me in Your arms. I have
been born again and again to serve You

714
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:14,969
Slake the thirst in me

715
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:23,869
O beautiful Krishna,
slake the thirst in me

716
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:30,833
O beautiful Krishna,
thirst consumes me to the depths

717
01:17:31,436 --> 01:17:39,067
O my beloved, the nectar of love

718
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:46,303
O my beloved...

719
01:17:46,779 --> 01:17:54,783
Let the nectar of love overflow,
so the world floods with feeling

720
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:03,992
Hold me in Your arms, beloved,
my life will be fulfilled

721
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:13,362
Ease the ache in my heart,
cool the fire in my body

722
01:18:13,962 --> 01:18:22,092
Hold me in Your arms, beloved,
my life will be fulfilled

723
01:18:55,155 --> 01:18:56,657
...

724
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:38,173
...

725
01:19:44,719 --> 01:20:04,824
...

726
01:20:14,951 --> 01:20:18,828
Gulabo, there's a millionaire
in the car. Come with me

727
01:20:20,037 --> 01:20:22,622
Go away. I'm not coming

728
01:20:24,415 --> 01:20:27,917
You won't? I've promised him.
Get up!

729
01:20:29,251 --> 01:20:30,608
Let go

730
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:36,299
You won't obey me?

731
01:20:38,728 --> 01:20:43,350
...

732
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:52,295
Pick up your cap!

733
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:59,019
I used my weak hand,
or else your face would be putty

734
01:20:59,143 --> 01:21:01,296
Be seated.

735
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:08,153
This park belongs to me.
If anyone bullies you, call for me

736
01:21:08,234 --> 01:21:10,401
I'll leave my clients
and come running

737
01:21:11,902 --> 01:21:13,403
Where are you?

738
01:21:15,072 --> 01:21:19,364
- Did you say something, Sattar?
- No. Who was talking?

739
01:21:20,115 --> 01:21:23,312
I get it. What do You think?
She's gone?

740
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:26,978
- Who is he?
- Who?

741
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:29,750
I wouldn't need to ask if I knew

742
01:21:29,829 --> 01:21:33,967
A postcard's contents can be
guessed at a glance

743
01:21:34,046 --> 01:21:37,218
But I, a masseur, can read
between the lines

744
01:21:37,299 --> 01:21:41,774
Your faraway look, oblivious to
the man sitting next to you

745
01:21:41,854 --> 01:21:48,048
Deaf to a word.
Sure signs that you're in love

746
01:21:49,215 --> 01:21:51,989
Slipping away is another sign

747
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:56,304
Tell me truly who he is

748
01:21:57,638 --> 01:21:58,641
A poet

749
01:21:58,722 --> 01:22:02,308
I have a poet friend.
What's your poet's name?

750
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,429
Vijay

751
01:22:05,618 --> 01:22:10,243
That's my friend's name.
I'll ask him if he knows another Vijay

752
01:22:10,689 --> 01:22:13,677
- Maybe they're the same person
- Not possible

753
01:22:16,356 --> 01:22:21,503
Maybe they are.
I'll ask him what's the mix-up

754
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:50,836
Brothers, is everything all right?
What brings you here?

755
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:55,907
What's it to you if someone's dead?
Carry on loafing around

756
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:57,257
Who died?

757
01:22:59,952 --> 01:23:02,427
- Whose last rites do you observe?
- Mother's

758
01:23:06,767 --> 01:23:07,970
Mother?

759
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,119
Brother...

760
01:23:10,556 --> 01:23:14,141
Don't call me brother.
We tolerated you because of her

761
01:23:14,892 --> 01:23:17,477
Now she's dead, you're dead for us

762
01:23:23,814 --> 01:23:28,408
Where will you go on
an empty stomach?

763
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:31,945
Who will look after you?

764
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:38,490
I don't want to stay in this house
for another minute

765
01:23:45,912 --> 01:23:50,413
Let's see you dance.
I'll play the drums for you

766
01:23:51,122 --> 01:23:54,250
Ask your friend to join us

767
01:23:54,330 --> 01:24:00,382
Drink it! I'd even drink poison
for her if she told me to

768
01:24:00,462 --> 01:24:01,545
Same here

769
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:03,725
He's shy

770
01:24:05,225 --> 01:24:09,436
Come, sir, drink up. For my sake

771
01:24:10,729 --> 01:24:14,174
Strange man.
Is he a man or a mouse?

772
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,527
He looks as if his grandmother died

773
01:24:32,098 --> 01:24:34,639
...

774
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:38,802
He's a beginner, but he
finished it off in one go

775
01:24:39,078 --> 01:24:44,742
You're a tiger!
When did you start drinking?

776
01:24:45,742 --> 01:24:51,043
Sorrow became unbearable

777
01:24:52,779 --> 01:24:58,840
In my anxiety I drank

778
01:25:00,426 --> 01:25:05,875
This heart of mine
was so helpless

779
01:25:07,322 --> 01:25:13,219
Out of pity for it I drank

780
01:25:15,003 --> 01:25:16,857
The world has spurned me...

781
01:25:16,938 --> 01:25:19,314
So he's a poet, too?

782
01:25:19,395 --> 01:25:24,468
Indeed. He's composed
over 500 poems

783
01:25:25,731 --> 01:25:35,650
The world has spurned me
countless times

784
01:25:36,934 --> 01:25:42,700
Today I spurned the whole world...

785
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:49,346
and drank

786
01:25:50,698 --> 01:25:56,919
Today I spurned the whole world...

787
01:25:57,978 --> 01:26:04,347
and drank

788
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:39,222
...

789
01:26:40,184 --> 01:26:43,897
...

790
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:49,095
...

791
01:26:52,764 --> 01:26:54,251
...

792
01:26:58,381 --> 01:27:06,598
...

793
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:22,330
...

794
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:27,831
...

795
01:27:39,573 --> 01:27:42,466
- Bijli

796
01:27:43,064 --> 01:27:44,648
Where are you going?

797
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:46,784
...

798
01:27:47,692 --> 01:27:49,234
My child is ill

799
01:27:49,624 --> 01:27:53,559
Damn your child! I need you, too

800
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,280
Tend to us first,
then see to your child

801
01:28:00,632 --> 01:28:01,567
Here.

802
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:06,916
Start the music

803
01:29:09,699 --> 01:29:15,695
These lanes, these houses
of auctioned pleasure

804
01:29:18,371 --> 01:29:24,083
These lanes, these houses
of auctioned pleasure

805
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:29,878
These ravaged caravans of life

806
01:29:29,888 --> 01:29:35,600
Where are they, the guardians of dignity?

807
01:29:35,762 --> 01:29:46,753
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

808
01:30:03,701 --> 01:30:09,662
These twisting lanes, this infamous market

809
01:30:09,828 --> 01:30:15,375
These anonymous men, this clinking of coins

810
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:21,217
This trading of chastity,
this insistent haggling

811
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:31,998
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

812
01:30:38,595 --> 01:30:44,309
These age-old, dreamless, dreaded lanes

813
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:50,188
These crushed, pallid, half-open buds

814
01:30:50,562 --> 01:30:56,115
This selling of sham celebrations

815
01:30:56,356 --> 01:31:07,322
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

816
01:31:11,147 --> 01:31:13,702
...

817
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:19,594
Dancing bells, chimes from latticed windows

818
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:27,797
The tablas play over weary breaths

819
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:33,362
Dancing bells, chimes from latticed windows

820
01:31:33,769 --> 01:31:39,532
The tablas play over weary breaths

821
01:31:40,199 --> 01:31:41,464
...

822
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:47,780
These soulless rooms, echo with coughing

823
01:31:48,057 --> 01:31:58,389
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

824
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:11,192
These garlands, these paan spittle stains

825
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:16,990
These shameless glances, these crude remarks

826
01:32:17,388 --> 01:32:23,013
These wilting bodies, these ailing faces

827
01:32:23,327 --> 01:32:34,072
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

828
01:32:40,711 --> 01:32:46,465
Old men have passed through here,
young men, too

829
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:53,791
Sturdy sons, fathers and husbands, too

830
01:32:54,040 --> 01:33:02,641
These are wives and sisters and mothers, too

831
01:33:02,985 --> 01:33:13,280
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

832
01:33:25,696 --> 01:33:31,327
This daughter of Eve seeks help

833
01:33:31,534 --> 01:33:36,919
The kin of Yashoda, the daughter of Radha

834
01:33:37,277 --> 01:33:42,803
This daughter of Eve seeks help

835
01:33:43,063 --> 01:33:48,786
The kin of Yashoda, the daughter of Radha

836
01:33:49,127 --> 01:33:54,797
The people of the Prophet,
the daughter of Zulekha

837
01:33:55,147 --> 01:34:05,217
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

838
01:34:12,516 --> 01:34:19,062
Summon the leaders of this land

839
01:34:19,228 --> 01:34:25,024
Show them these alleys, these lanes,
this sight

840
01:34:25,404 --> 01:34:31,445
Summon those who claim to be proud of India

841
01:34:31,525 --> 01:34:43,143
Where are those who claim to be
proud of India?

842
01:35:09,013 --> 01:35:09,987
Mr. Vijay.

843
01:35:13,102 --> 01:35:14,433
Mr. Vijay.

844
01:35:15,233 --> 01:35:16,317
Who is it?

845
01:35:16,705 --> 01:35:20,528
It's you, Gulab.

846
01:35:20,609 --> 01:35:22,359
Come with me.

847
01:35:24,404 --> 01:35:27,046
Taking pity on me again?

848
01:35:29,114 --> 01:35:32,034
Today I am not hungry.

849
01:35:32,534 --> 01:35:37,527
I have drowned hunger in drink.

850
01:35:38,912 --> 01:35:41,237
I have drunk a lot.

851
01:35:43,412 --> 01:35:49,335
I've drunk my joys and sorrows,
I have swallowed everything.

852
01:35:53,045 --> 01:35:54,255
Where are you taking me?

853
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:59,423
Come to my house, you need to rest.

854
01:36:01,121 --> 01:36:02,677
Leave when you feel better.

855
01:36:03,677 --> 01:36:06,960
Should I leave when I feel better?

856
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:12,182
I'll feel better when
I've left this world, Gulab.

857
01:36:13,841 --> 01:36:18,518
Everyone has gone. My job has gone.

858
01:36:18,685 --> 01:36:23,772
My mother has gone, too. Forever.

859
01:36:25,607 --> 01:36:30,738
So what am I doing here?
Why am I alive, Gulab?

860
01:36:31,151 --> 01:36:36,989
Don't talk like that.
The world needs you and your poetry.

861
01:36:37,069 --> 01:36:39,407
The world needs nobody.

862
01:36:40,668 --> 01:36:45,410
I tried so hard to make my poetry
reach the world.

863
01:36:46,141 --> 01:36:49,732
But do you know how the world valued it?

864
01:36:50,068 --> 01:36:54,374
Waste paper sold for ten annas.

865
01:36:55,584 --> 01:36:59,376
My life is valued at ten annas, Gulab.

866
01:36:59,751 --> 01:37:03,713
You want me to stay alive
for those ten annas?

867
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:09,258
Don't lose courage.
Others will stand by you in life.

868
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:11,925
Meena, for instance.

869
01:37:13,726 --> 01:37:14,732
Meena?

870
01:37:19,264 --> 01:37:21,277
How do you know her?

871
01:37:22,016 --> 01:37:26,308
Her name was on your file of poems.
Who is Meena?

872
01:37:27,714 --> 01:37:28,925
Meena.

873
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:35,024
A high-society, decent woman...

874
01:37:36,066 --> 01:37:39,276
who loves when it pleases her...

875
01:37:40,193 --> 01:37:43,997
and sells love for a comfortable life.

876
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:50,163
But why such an interest in her?

877
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:58,955
You were interested in her. That's why.

878
01:38:08,626 --> 01:38:13,570
You mean you...no, forget me.

879
01:38:15,672 --> 01:38:19,909
You will get nothing from me but sorrow.

880
01:38:21,045 --> 01:38:25,773
I've never been able to make anyone happy.

881
01:38:29,756 --> 01:38:31,919
Mr. Vijay! Mr. Vijay!

882
01:38:35,282 --> 01:38:37,347
Juhi! Juhi!

883
01:39:24,589 --> 01:39:26,090
You'll publish them?

884
01:39:26,404 --> 01:39:31,054
Why? Am I crazy? Call that poetry?

885
01:39:31,134 --> 01:39:33,723
The world needs you and your poetry.

886
01:39:33,803 --> 01:39:38,434
You should know we publish famous
poets, not the trash of novices.

887
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:42,727
When you couldn't feed yourself,
how could you bear my burden?

888
01:39:42,807 --> 01:39:45,594
Father has gone and with him his duty.

889
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:49,195
It wasn't our wish that our parents
produced such a good-for-nothing.

890
01:40:47,759 --> 01:40:59,625
...

891
01:41:27,962 --> 01:41:33,438
...

892
01:42:22,224 --> 01:42:31,404
...

893
01:42:44,467 --> 01:42:51,499
...

894
01:42:59,422 --> 01:43:02,733
...

895
01:43:14,256 --> 01:43:21,233
...

896
01:43:29,892 --> 01:43:31,893
Have you read about the poet's suicide?

897
01:43:31,974 --> 01:43:34,937
I knew him. I wonder what troubled him.

898
01:43:35,395 --> 01:43:36,888
Serve us tea.

899
01:43:37,223 --> 01:43:39,189
"Tragic Death of a Young Poet"

900
01:43:46,362 --> 01:43:50,571
"A young man jumped in front
of the Burdwan night train

901
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:56,159
"His body was so badly mutilated,
identifying him was impossible

902
01:43:57,076 --> 01:44:00,077
"A letter was found in the young man's pocket

903
01:44:00,995 --> 01:44:06,080
"It contained a poem.
His last message to the world.

904
01:44:08,124 --> 01:44:09,208
"The poet's name...

905
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:10,958
was Vijay."

906
01:44:11,177 --> 01:44:11,987
...

907
01:44:19,507 --> 01:44:20,937
Are you all right, dear?

908
01:44:23,046 --> 01:44:24,074
Hmm.

909
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:54,684
Gulabo.

910
01:45:09,494 --> 01:45:10,870
What's wrong, Sattar?

911
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:50,054
Salutations Ma'am!

912
01:45:51,895 --> 01:45:54,520
SHADOWS

913
01:46:00,608 --> 01:46:01,858
Send her in.

914
01:46:02,518 --> 01:46:03,415
Go in.

915
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:20,052
Who are you?

916
01:46:22,364 --> 01:46:23,262
Gulab.

917
01:46:26,345 --> 01:46:27,350
Where from?

918
01:46:27,816 --> 01:46:31,699
Sona...from Dharmtallah

919
01:46:35,295 --> 01:46:36,322
Give me that file of poems.

920
01:46:37,381 --> 01:46:41,817
So you know it contains poems.
Then you'll know they are beautiful.

921
01:46:42,887 --> 01:46:44,384
I've come to get them published.

922
01:46:53,807 --> 01:46:56,893
You came to show them to my husband?

923
01:46:59,518 --> 01:47:00,853
What's your price?

924
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:03,479
- You'll publish them? - Maybe.

925
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:05,898
Name your price.

926
01:47:07,354 --> 01:47:08,566
Price?

927
01:47:11,067 --> 01:47:16,028
I haven't come to sell them,
I've brought them for publishing.

928
01:47:21,491 --> 01:47:25,118
These poems are very precious to you, right?

929
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:31,288
- How did you know Vijay? - By good fortune.

930
01:47:31,705 --> 01:47:33,413
What was your relationship with him?

931
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:37,207
Relationship?

932
01:47:37,288 --> 01:47:42,585
I want to know how a fine man
like him met a good lady like you.

933
01:47:43,864 --> 01:47:45,004
By good fortune.

934
01:47:46,504 --> 01:47:51,509
You sell much for money,
why do you refuse to sell these poems?

935
01:47:59,805 --> 01:48:01,756
Are you Meena?

936
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:09,026
My husband will be here any time.
You have to sell these poems to me.

937
01:48:09,268 --> 01:48:13,946
- I'll pay 1,000 rupees, 2,000..., 3000...
- Not even 30,000

938
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,629
- What's that? - Nothing

939
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:24,946
Show me

940
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:35,035
"For Meena...

941
01:48:37,369 --> 01:48:40,329
"whose memory lives in every word."

942
01:49:02,843 --> 01:49:06,303
I brought them to have them published.

943
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:22,365
What is that?

944
01:49:22,606 --> 01:49:25,106
My life savings.

945
01:49:26,983 --> 01:49:32,735
I can't give more than this
for their publication.

946
01:49:36,529 --> 01:49:38,989
It's vital to me that they're published.

947
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:45,283
If you will publish them,
I'll be eternally grateful to you.

948
01:49:46,023 --> 01:49:50,132
...

949
01:50:14,053 --> 01:50:15,271
All sold out.

950
01:50:17,513 --> 01:50:22,267
A fine bookseller!
We want Vijay's book. You don't have it?

951
01:50:22,348 --> 01:50:23,557
All sold out.

952
01:50:23,724 --> 01:50:27,102
There's a new edition,
how can it be sold out?

953
01:50:27,269 --> 01:50:29,645
You're selling it "under the counter."

954
01:50:30,103 --> 01:50:34,511
Have the third edition tomorrow,
or we'll burn your shop! Get it?

955
01:50:55,325 --> 01:50:58,838
If only you could see this with your own eyes.

956
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,422
- Good morning. - Good morning, doctor.

957
01:51:04,462 --> 01:51:07,042
Have you established his identity?

958
01:51:07,209 --> 01:51:12,171
No, he hasn't spoken since he was admitted.

959
01:51:18,077 --> 01:51:19,267
Hello.

960
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:28,639
How are you today?

961
01:51:33,475 --> 01:51:37,197
Let me know at once if he speaks.

962
01:51:37,277 --> 01:51:38,617
Sure.

963
01:51:54,611 --> 01:51:57,488
I can't pay more than 5,000 for them.

964
01:51:58,115 --> 01:52:01,159
They're by Vijay, but the price is too high.

965
01:52:01,549 --> 01:52:07,162
Do you want to cream off all
the profit and leave me nothing?

966
01:52:07,329 --> 01:52:10,581
Then name a sensible price. Show some respect.

967
01:52:10,746 --> 01:52:14,583
Sir, are rare treasures ever sold?

968
01:52:14,748 --> 01:52:21,337
Vijay's last, unique poems.
I'll share fifty-fifty.

969
01:52:21,417 --> 01:52:24,172
Impossible. I can't pay that much.

970
01:52:24,505 --> 01:52:26,664
Nice to have met you.

971
01:52:28,258 --> 01:52:30,843
Wait. You're a strange man.

972
01:52:31,802 --> 01:52:35,971
My last offer: twenty-five per cent

973
01:52:37,225 --> 01:52:38,805
or you may leave.

974
01:52:39,723 --> 01:52:44,080
I wouldn't like you to think I'm unreasonable.

975
01:52:44,393 --> 01:52:46,435
Here. Let's shake hands.

976
01:52:49,732 --> 01:52:51,070
Scoundrel.

977
01:52:52,571 --> 01:52:54,857
The shadows of thoughts and dreams stir

978
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:59,108
I adorn your hair with flowers

979
01:52:59,508 --> 01:53:02,653
Your eyes lower, full of feeling

980
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:07,365
I do now know what I will say today?

981
01:53:07,572 --> 01:53:11,034
My lips are parched, my voice is hesitant

982
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:14,911
The shadows of thoughts and dreams stir

983
01:53:16,032 --> 01:53:19,247
I hold your soft arms in an embrace

984
01:53:20,122 --> 01:53:23,456
My lips cast a shadow on your lips

985
01:53:24,082 --> 01:53:27,209
You are sure we will never be parted

986
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:31,379
I guess we were one, but still strangers

987
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:35,214
The shadows of thoughts and dreams stir

988
01:53:38,842 --> 01:53:40,154
"Shadows"?

989
01:53:41,332 --> 01:53:43,981
Doctor. Doctor.

990
01:53:49,051 --> 01:53:54,142
My poems. All the poems are mine!
This is my book

991
01:53:54,392 --> 01:53:57,227
Of course. But what is your name?

992
01:53:57,769 --> 01:54:03,273
My name is Vijay. See?
This book was written by me.

993
01:54:03,773 --> 01:54:07,194
The Vijay who wrote this book is long dead.

994
01:54:07,859 --> 01:54:10,653
Think carefully, what is your name?

995
01:54:11,779 --> 01:54:15,697
Why don't you believe me? I am Vijay.

996
01:54:17,449 --> 01:54:19,575
I tell you I am Vijay!

997
01:54:34,417 --> 01:54:36,043
Why have you kept me here?

998
01:54:38,002 --> 01:54:39,799
Let me go!

999
01:54:42,714 --> 01:54:46,257
I think he has lost his mind

1000
01:54:48,723 --> 01:54:50,467
Telephone Doctor Sen at once.

1001
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:56,523
- Sir. - Sir.

1002
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,932
- Sir. - Please, sir.
1003
01:55.:02,501 --> 01:55:03,582
Yes

1003
01:55:08,112 --> 01:55:10,481
So you are Vijay's brothers?

1004
01:55:11,076 --> 01:55:14,427
- His older brothers. - I am the eldest

1005
01:55:15,929 --> 01:55:17,754
What do you want of me?

1006
01:55:18,606 --> 01:55:20,742
- Tell him. - No you go ahead.

1007
01:55:20,824 --> 01:55:21,986
- Shall I tell him? - Yes.

1008
01:55:22,270 --> 01:55:24,488
All right. No you go ahead.

1009
01:55:24,690 --> 01:55:25,679
...

1010
01:55:25,867 --> 01:55:28,341
I asked what you want.

1011
01:55:29,167 --> 01:55:33,951
Well, I brought up Vijay and educated him.

1012
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:37,454
Fed him with great affection.

1013
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,956
I made him capable of being someone one day.

1014
01:55:40,415 --> 01:55:41,498
So did I.

1015
01:55:41,707 --> 01:55:44,419
My time is precious. Get to the point.

1016
01:55:45,378 --> 01:55:50,855
The point is, we're here to
collect some money from you.

1017
01:55:51,895 --> 01:55:53,140
What nonsense.

1018
01:55:56,424 --> 01:55:58,092
Are you sane?

1019
01:55:58,634 --> 01:56:02,428
We are the rightful heirs to all his property

1020
01:56:02,552 --> 01:56:03,804
including his songs and poems.

1021
01:56:03,882 --> 01:56:09,018
We have a legal right to the money
you are gaining from his works.

1022
01:56:09,099 --> 01:56:13,612
We don't want all.
We won't object to getting a share of it.

1023
01:56:13,869 --> 01:56:14,856
Yes.

1024
01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:18,562
I don't know you and I didn't
get the poems from you.

1025
01:56:19,146 --> 01:56:21,848
You won't get a penny. Understand?

1026
01:56:26,874 --> 01:56:34,567
...

1027
01:56:49,624 --> 01:56:50,934
Come in.

1028
01:56:54,125 --> 01:56:54,830
That's him.

1029
01:57:12,679 --> 01:57:15,556
No, it isn't Vijay.

1030
01:57:19,766 --> 01:57:21,183
Shyam!

1031
01:57:23,983 --> 01:57:27,020
That's right. He's not Vijay.

1032
01:57:45,144 --> 01:57:46,990
So you want a share in the profits?

1033
01:57:49,579 --> 01:57:50,728
Yes.

1034
01:57:52,077 --> 01:57:54,662
The rightful claimant is Vijay.

1035
01:57:55,759 --> 01:57:57,205
He's alive.

1036
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:58,880
What?

1037
01:57:59,081 --> 01:58:00,582
Vijay is alive.

1038
01:58:01,761 --> 01:58:04,100
He's alive?

1039
01:58:08,377 --> 01:58:10,588
You must be joking.

1040
01:58:10,754 --> 01:58:12,465
I never joke.

1041
01:58:13,048 --> 01:58:17,802
However, you will get a share of the profit.

1042
01:58:18,384 --> 01:58:26,142
Two per cent, on condition that
you refuse to identify Vijay.

1043
01:58:28,557 --> 01:58:32,059
What? Why shouldn't we identify our brother?

1044
01:58:32,226 --> 01:58:34,893
- Do you consider us so nasty?
- Are we so low?

1045
01:58:34,973 --> 01:58:37,730
For a mere two per cent?

1046
01:58:37,896 --> 01:58:40,105
Make it sixteen per cent.

1047
01:58:41,164 --> 01:58:42,813
You scoundrel.

1048
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:44,943
Very well.

1049
01:58:45,545 --> 01:58:48,981
Mr Ghosh is a real gentleman.

1050
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:52,989
Massage! Oil massage!

1051
01:58:53,247 --> 01:58:57,710
Massage! Oil massage!

1052
01:59:00,196 --> 01:59:02,888
- Massage! Oil massage! - Sattar.

1053
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:11,713
...

1054
01:59:13,367 --> 01:59:19,424
A ghost! Lord, please make it vanish!

1055
01:59:19,870 --> 01:59:22,952
Lord, please make it vanish!

1056
01:59:23,032 --> 01:59:26,170
Lord, please make it vanish!

1057
01:59:26,926 --> 01:59:29,051
- Gone! - Sattar...

1058
01:59:29,343 --> 01:59:31,848
Let go of my neck! It isn't mine.

1059
01:59:31,929 --> 01:59:33,388
It's me. Vijay.

1060
01:59:33,468 --> 01:59:35,001
Look at me.

1061
01:59:35,473 --> 01:59:38,974
So you aren't dead yet?

1062
01:59:41,303 --> 01:59:43,184
He's really alive.

1063
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:45,639
I've been forcibly detained.

1064
01:59:46,024 --> 01:59:47,896
- I see. - Get me out somehow.

1065
01:59:49,986 --> 01:59:50,817
...

1066
01:59:56,489 --> 01:59:57,902
What do you want?

1067
01:59:59,153 --> 02:00:03,575
I want to whirl my hands on your
head, only if you agree.

1068
02:00:03,769 --> 02:00:05,279
Massage!

1069
02:00:05,969 --> 02:00:07,698
Hold your cap.

1070
02:00:08,036 --> 02:00:09,329
Massage!

1071
02:00:09,409 --> 02:00:14,581
If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom

1072
02:00:14,663 --> 02:00:22,383
Don't fret, leave it to me,
I'll make things right soon

1073
02:00:22,574 --> 02:00:25,048
Massage, oil massage

1074
02:00:25,128 --> 02:00:30,334
If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom

1075
02:00:30,414 --> 02:00:37,768
Don't fret, leave it to me,
I'll make things right soon

1076
02:00:37,848 --> 02:00:38,536
...

1077
02:00:50,434 --> 02:00:51,227
Brother.

1078
02:01:01,027 --> 02:01:02,217
Brother.

1079
02:01:07,647 --> 02:01:08,739
Brother.

1080
02:01:09,696 --> 02:01:16,157
Don't you recognize me?
I'm your brother Vijay.

1081
02:01:17,805 --> 02:01:18,801
Why are you so quiet?

1082
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:23,955
Don't you want to recognize me, either?

1083
02:01:24,747 --> 02:01:25,913
Are you mad?

1084
02:01:26,481 --> 02:01:27,999
Vijay's dead.

1085
02:01:28,915 --> 02:01:33,168
Pushing your way in here, with the
nerve to say you're our brother.

1086
02:01:33,335 --> 02:01:39,917
As if you're my brother. Get out! Hurry!

1087
02:01:59,392 --> 02:02:00,762
Where are you heading?

1088
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:06,344
To commemorate Vijay's death
anniversary. Are you coming, too?

1089
02:02:06,730 --> 02:02:11,763
Of course. Vijay was a great poet
and a friend.

1090
02:02:12,316 --> 02:02:15,019
Did you really know Vijay?

1091
02:02:15,098 --> 02:02:16,035
Yes.

1092
02:02:16,235 --> 02:02:17,365
Sit with me.

1093
02:02:17,446 --> 02:02:18,577
OK.

1094
02:02:20,872 --> 02:02:24,204
Don't block the way, move aside.

1095
02:02:26,367 --> 02:02:28,035
He was a fine poet.

1096
02:02:28,115 --> 02:02:33,279
A gem of a man.
He often used to come to me for help.

1097
02:02:33,788 --> 02:02:36,411
But for me, he would have died
six months earlier.

1098
02:02:36,492 --> 02:02:39,606
- How? - Of starvation.

1099
02:02:39,935 --> 02:02:41,730
Oh! I see.

1100
02:02:41,959 --> 02:02:43,958
- Hurry, or we won't get a seat. - OK.

1101
02:03:29,113 --> 02:03:32,240
Ladies and gentlemen, as you all know...

1102
02:03:33,075 --> 02:03:36,611
we are here to commemorate
poet laureate Vijay's death.

1103
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:41,577
On this day last year...

1104
02:03:42,203 --> 02:03:46,487
the world's great poet was taken
from us in that terrible moment.

1105
02:03:47,438 --> 02:03:48,582
If it were possible...

1106
02:03:49,299 --> 02:03:54,384
I would have given my fortune
and my life to save Vijay.

1107
02:03:56,525 --> 02:03:58,214
But that could not be.

1108
02:04:00,590 --> 02:04:03,643
Why? Because of you all.

1109
02:04:04,717 --> 02:04:09,798
It's said he took his own life,
but in fact, you killed him.

1110
02:04:10,469 --> 02:04:15,890
If only he were alive, he would see
the world which made him starve...

1111
02:04:16,683 --> 02:04:19,684
is now ready to shower wealth upon him.

1112
02:04:20,809 --> 02:04:22,310
The world in which he was unknown...

1113
02:04:22,770 --> 02:04:29,062
is ready to crown him king of
hearts, crown him with glory.

1114
02:04:29,688 --> 02:04:33,345
It would rescue him from poverty
and install him in a palace.

1115
02:04:37,867 --> 02:04:44,949
This world of palaces, of thrones, of crowns

1116
02:04:45,408 --> 02:04:52,663
This world of division, enemy of man

1117
02:04:56,764 --> 02:05:03,839
This world of palaces, of thrones, of crowns

1118
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:11,345
This world of division, enemy of man

1119
02:05:11,590 --> 02:05:18,429
This world of blind custom, hungry for wealth

1120
02:05:18,929 --> 02:05:25,678
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1121
02:05:26,274 --> 02:05:33,380
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1122
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:44,281
...

1123
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:51,639
Bodies wounded, souls thirsty

1124
02:05:51,996 --> 02:05:58,779
Confusion in eyes, despondency in hearts

1125
02:05:59,299 --> 02:06:05,951
Is this a world or a place of bewilderment?

1126
02:06:06,417 --> 02:06:13,003
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1127
02:06:13,633 --> 02:06:20,576
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1128
02:06:20,826 --> 02:06:29,229
...

1129
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:38,275
Here a man's life is a plaything

1130
02:06:38,810 --> 02:06:45,532
Here live worshippers of the dead

1131
02:06:45,954 --> 02:06:52,790
Here life has no value, death comes cheaper

1132
02:06:53,026 --> 02:06:59,834
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1133
02:07:00,201 --> 02:07:07,027
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1134
02:07:07,387 --> 02:07:16,487
...

1135
02:07:18,125 --> 02:07:25,014
Youth strays into crime

1136
02:07:25,295 --> 02:07:32,025
Young bodies are adorned for the marketplace

1137
02:07:32,592 --> 02:07:39,326
Here love is another name for trade

1138
02:07:39,716 --> 02:07:46,369
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1139
02:07:46,811 --> 02:07:54,090
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1140
02:07:54,282 --> 02:08:03,974
...

1141
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:11,572
This world where man counts for nothing

1142
02:08:12,116 --> 02:08:19,004
Loyalty and friendship count for nothing

1143
02:08:19,241 --> 02:08:25,971
This world where man counts for nothing

1144
02:08:26,262 --> 02:08:33,184
Loyalty and friendship count for nothing

1145
02:08:33,629 --> 02:08:40,092
Where love has no importance

1146
02:08:40,508 --> 02:08:47,263
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1147
02:08:47,615 --> 02:08:53,974
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1148
02:08:54,405 --> 02:09:07,407
...

1149
02:09:07,702 --> 02:09:13,477
Burn it, blow this world away

1150
02:09:13,824 --> 02:09:22,218
Burn it, blow this world away

1151
02:09:22,651 --> 02:09:28,499
Take this world away from my sight

1152
02:09:28,579 --> 02:09:34,050
Take charge of this world, you can keep it

1153
02:09:34,411 --> 02:09:39,926
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1154
02:09:40,758 --> 02:09:50,861
...

1155
02:10:58,122 --> 02:11:04,689
Stop his brothers, give what they want,
but they mustn't identify him.

1156
02:11:05,751 --> 02:11:11,338
Mr Ghosh, all your money cannot
stop Vijay being identified now.

1157
02:11:12,422 --> 02:11:14,313
How many will you silence?

1158
02:11:14,966 --> 02:11:18,359
No expense spared, I will buy everyone...

1159
02:11:18,843 --> 02:11:21,485
but I don't want it proved that he's Vijay

1160
02:11:22,012 --> 02:11:25,411
or else our name is mud, we'll be finished.

1161
02:11:25,804 --> 02:11:30,247
Save yourself. I know how to save my own neck.

1162
02:11:30,723 --> 02:11:31,558
What do you mean?

1163
02:11:35,394 --> 02:11:41,997
You think you'll get away with it
so easily? You denied him once.

1164
02:11:43,108 --> 02:11:48,611
I sway with the wind; I followed
you when it was in my interest.

1165
02:11:48,778 --> 02:11:51,416
Now I'll ally Vijay to a better interest.

1166
02:11:51,621 --> 02:11:54,607
- You scoundrel. Get out. - See you.

1167
02:11:58,098 --> 02:12:00,306
- See you. - I said, get out

1168
02:12:05,325 --> 02:12:07,802
Have you won the lottery?

1169
02:12:07,881 --> 02:12:12,573
Not yet, but I have my hands on
the king of fame.

1170
02:12:12,653 --> 02:12:18,015
I've got Vijay; I'll earn millions
from publishing his poems.

1171
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:20,049
...

1172
02:12:20,129 --> 02:12:24,050
Well done, Sheikh!

1173
02:12:24,549 --> 02:12:29,384
You found a real gold mine, but do
you think you'll mine it all alone?

1174
02:12:30,886 --> 02:12:32,262
You'll share it with me.

1175
02:12:34,221 --> 02:12:38,501
Idiots! What are you gawking at? Get out!

1176
02:12:40,243 --> 02:12:41,586
Get out!

1177
02:12:44,144 --> 02:12:47,080
You are most unreasonable, young man.

1178
02:12:47,524 --> 02:12:50,940
- To whom have I the honor?
- No honor is high enough for me.

1179
02:12:51,566 --> 02:12:55,233
I can identify Vijay if I so choose...

1180
02:12:55,651 --> 02:13:00,394
and if I don't, he'll be
shut away in a mental asylum

1181
02:13:00,904 --> 02:13:08,541
Are you head of state to lock him away?
His brothers will identify him.

1182
02:13:08,825 --> 02:13:12,327
Of course we will. He's my brother, after all.

1183
02:13:12,453 --> 02:13:16,789
- He may not care about us.
- Others may have profited.

1184
02:13:16,956 --> 02:13:20,207
- But he is our blood.
- Why shouldn't we identify him?

1185
02:13:20,288 --> 02:13:24,379
Well said! That answers this joker.

1186
02:13:24,461 --> 02:13:27,420
See that? Brothers are brothers!

1187
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:32,343
- I spent 5,000 on his education.
- 4,000 feeding him.

1188
02:13:32,422 --> 02:13:35,717
If we'd loaned that at interest,
we'd have 15,000 now.

1189
02:13:35,883 --> 02:13:38,492
Will you pay us 15,000 to identify him?

1190
02:13:40,234 --> 02:13:42,720
Fifteen thousand?

1191
02:13:43,024 --> 02:13:44,962
Yes. Fifteen thousand.

1192
02:13:46,057 --> 02:13:51,767
Gentlemen, but you have your
precious brother back.

1193
02:13:52,435 --> 02:13:54,356
What more could you want?

1194
02:13:54,436 --> 02:13:58,608
Old man, we don't want a brother,
we want money.

1195
02:13:58,688 --> 02:14:00,494
We can't eat him.

1196
02:14:09,333 --> 02:14:12,980
Vijay, my brother!

1197
02:14:13,124 --> 02:14:22,940
...

1198
02:15:01,018 --> 02:15:03,522
Is he Vijay? What proof have you?

1199
02:15:03,603 --> 02:15:08,795
Soon you'll say I'm not Sattar.

1200
02:15:09,273 --> 02:15:11,595
Do we believe him?

1201
02:15:13,791 --> 02:15:16,886
Then who came under the train?

1202
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:19,321
We prove it.

1203
02:15:19,487 --> 02:15:22,706
- We are his brothers.
- The neighborhood knows that.

1204
02:15:22,906 --> 02:15:25,410
We say he is Vijay.

1205
02:15:26,837 --> 02:15:28,038
I prove it.

1206
02:15:28,118 --> 02:15:31,164
And I confirm he is Vijay, my boyhood friend.

1207
02:15:31,575 --> 02:15:33,452
The poet laureate Vijay!

1208
02:15:33,534 --> 02:15:39,915
Here a man's death
is valued more than his life

1209
02:15:40,306 --> 02:15:47,066
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1210
02:15:47,259 --> 02:15:53,211
Would I care if such a world were mine?

1211
02:15:53,291 --> 02:15:57,928
- Long live! - The poet laureate Vijay!

1212
02:15:58,008 --> 02:15:58,836
Gentlemen...

1213
02:15:58,916 --> 02:16:01,216
- Long live! - The poet laureate Vijay!

1214
02:16:01,297 --> 02:16:06,311
Be quiet. Vijay will speak.

1215
02:16:07,231 --> 02:16:08,849
Ladies and gentlemen.

1216
02:16:09,805 --> 02:16:14,603
The Vijay you are ready to
open your arms to...

1217
02:16:16,219 --> 02:16:21,239
the Vijay for whom you shout slogans...

1218
02:16:22,526 --> 02:16:25,934
I am not that Vijay.

1219
02:16:26,128 --> 02:16:27,795
What?

1220
02:16:29,417 --> 02:16:30,450
Vijay.

1221
02:16:30,530 --> 02:16:31,991
I'm not Vijay.

1222
02:16:32,163 --> 02:16:34,603
If you aren't Vijay, why deceive us?

1223
02:16:34,874 --> 02:16:38,183
I always said he was an imposter.

1224
02:16:38,476 --> 02:16:39,741
A publicity-seeker.

1225
02:16:39,822 --> 02:16:43,004
Hit him!

1226
02:16:43,322 --> 02:16:45,843
Hit him!

1227
02:16:46,093 --> 02:16:52,322
...

1228
02:16:54,281 --> 02:16:56,269
Hit him!

1229
02:17:09,271 --> 02:17:14,768
Burn it, destroy this world

1230
02:17:15,224 --> 02:17:23,607
Burn it, destroy this world

1231
02:17:24,084 --> 02:17:29,740
Take this world away from my sight

1232
02:17:30,021 --> 02:17:35,572
This world belongs to you, you can keep it

1233
02:17:35,844 --> 02:17:45,873
...

1234
02:17:51,031 --> 02:17:54,911
Are you mad? Stop them!

1235
02:17:55,075 --> 02:17:57,411
There is still time, tell them you are Vijay.

1236
02:18:06,333 --> 02:18:11,513
They have all come because of you,
why don't you explain to them?

1237
02:18:11,710 --> 02:18:16,695
I am not that Vijay. He has been long dead.

1238
02:18:16,964 --> 02:18:19,257
What are you saying?

1239
02:18:19,671 --> 02:18:24,225
Be sensible. Sheikh, your brothers
and friends say that you are Vijay.

1240
02:18:25,969 --> 02:18:27,221
Friends?

1241
02:18:29,346 --> 02:18:34,266
They are not my friends.
They're the friends of wealth.

1242
02:18:36,434 --> 02:18:38,894
Once they refused to identify me.

1243
02:18:40,602 --> 02:18:41,978
But now...

1244
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:47,399
To take revenge on a few false
friends, why turn against yourself?

1245
02:18:48,025 --> 02:18:50,651
Why refuse fame and fortune?

1246
02:18:51,151 --> 02:18:55,757
If you must, reject your brothers,
reject those you begrudge.

1247
02:18:55,947 --> 02:19:01,032
I complain against no one...
not against any human being.

1248
02:19:01,448 --> 02:19:07,036
I complain against a society that
tears away a man's compassion.

1249
02:19:07,494 --> 02:19:11,623
That makes a brother a stranger,
a friend an enemy for self-interest.

1250
02:19:12,206 --> 02:19:18,751
I complain against a culture,
a world which worships the dead...

1251
02:19:19,587 --> 02:19:22,502
and tramples the living underfoot.

1252
02:19:23,838 --> 02:19:27,757
Where it is considered cowardice
to cry for the suffering of others.

1253
02:19:28,427 --> 02:19:31,009
Where it is considered weakness
to respect others.

1254
02:19:32,092 --> 02:19:36,346
In such an atmosphere, I shall
never find peace, Meena.

1255
02:19:37,425 --> 02:19:39,098
I shall never find peace.

1256
02:19:40,226 --> 02:19:43,504
That is why I am going far away.

1257
02:20:31,712 --> 02:20:34,614
Juhi, someone called out to me.

1258
02:20:38,423 --> 02:20:40,718
No one called. Go to sleep.

1259
02:20:51,765 --> 02:20:55,858
Gulabo, where are you going? You're feverish.

1260
02:20:56,143 --> 02:20:59,623
Someone called me. Let me go.

1261
02:21:56,272 --> 02:21:58,807
I am going far away, Gulab.

1262
02:21:59,948 --> 02:22:00,991
Where?

1263
02:22:02,784 --> 02:22:05,577
To a place where I shall not
have to go any further.

1264
02:22:08,985 --> 02:22:12,183
Is that what you came to say?

1265
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:17,957
Will you come with me?
