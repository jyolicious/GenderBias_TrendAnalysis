1
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:55,807
Dear God.

2
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,980
Please, bless me.

3
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,180
So that I can end the loveless

4
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,563
engagement of my friend Ashok.

5
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:12,353
'Strange is this farcical love,
Trapped into it I was.'

6
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,348
'Fearing my mother,
I've come here.'

7
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,390
'On my own, I'm not here.
But, forced I was to come here.'

8
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,688
Wow!

9
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:21,772
Ashok, it's 7 minutes past 7, now.

10
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:25,813
My daughter, your fiancé, Sarita

11
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,813
has turned sweet seventeen.

12
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:32,897
So, on this joyous occasion,
she will cut the cake.

13
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:35,438
And you will lend her your hand.

14
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:38,022
What do you say?

15
00:03:38,188 --> 00:03:40,598
As per my friend's watch and mine

16
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:44,147
there are still 40 seconds to go.

17
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:48,807
Move aside! Run for your life!

18
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:50,105
Move!

19
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:54,223
Which one of you is Mr Ashok?

20
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:57,313
I am Ashok.
- You are?

21
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,140
Mr Ashok,

22
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,180
your friend, Mr Poche Khan,
died under my lorry.

23
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,430
Poche Khan, my dear friend!

24
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,897
If you want to have
a last glimpse of him

25
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,563
let's go to the hospital.
- Come soon.

26
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,105
Poche Khan, my dear friend!
Poor fellow!

27
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,390
Ashok fooled us once again, today!

28
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,563
Someone is dying and
you are whining!

29
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:20,520
Anyway, I'll call
the hospital and inquire.

30
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:29,270
What's wrong?

31
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,688
That's the alarm.
I have no time, now.

32
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,223
What's all this nonsense?

33
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:36,022
Sheela's dad came all the way
from Japan, with his nonsense.

34
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:38,348
Really? As in, love is in danger?
- You bet!

35
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:41,313
Never!
- Then, how do you meet her?

36
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:44,605
I use of my love's
sari to meet my lover!

37
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,395
Wish you the best of luck.
- Hey, Ashok.

38
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,263
Don't let mom get
to know about this.

39
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,730
Or she'll actually have a Pathan
sent from Kabul to kill me!

40
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:03,563
Greetings.

41
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,438
Please sit.

42
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,855
What's it?
- Gayatri Devi!

43
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,598
It's been years,
since you were told

44
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,897
of your older son's death in Japan.

45
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,855
For me, he died the day

46
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:21,645
I arranged his marriage here,

47
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:27,520
but, he married a Japanese
girl there, against my wishes.

48
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,313
He had a child from the marriage.

49
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,270
When a person gets married,
he will have children, too.

50
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:37,395
If you're here to talk
about that child or woman,

51
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,688
then you are wasting your time,
as well as mine.

52
00:05:42,147 --> 00:05:44,270
I believe,
even the child's mother is no more.

53
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,395
My sympathies.

54
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,688
Before dying, the child's
mother wrote a letter to you.

55
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:52,605
To me?

56
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:55,855
If you permit it, then I'll
read the translation for you.

57
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:57,938
Read it.

58
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:00,688
'Greetings, mother.'

59
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
'The doctors tell me
I won't live for too long.'

60
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:11,063
'My husband used to say
that a child is an image of God.'

61
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,730
'He used to also say'

62
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:17,270
'that the day you would
see this tiny form of God'

63
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,520
'your temper would cool down.'

64
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,813
'You would surely forgive us.'

65
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:26,605
'He left this world without
his wish coming true.'

66
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:32,105
'Perhaps, the joys that
you did not get from your son'

67
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:35,313
'may come to you,
through your grandson.'

68
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,938
'God has given you everything.'

69
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:43,270
'So, if you can't claim
this child as one of your own'

70
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,270
'consider him to be
a destitute mother's child'

71
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,353
'or a that of a maid.'

72
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,855
'It would be kind of you,
if you let him stay with you.'

73
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,313
'Save him from going
to an orphanage.'

74
00:06:56,022 --> 00:06:58,897
'God will bestow you
with more happiness, then.'

75
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,520
'I guess, I can't sign
off as your daughter-in-law.'

76
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:05,395
'I am merely, the mother
of a helpless child - Nyoshi.'

77
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,438
What do you want me to do, ma'am?

78
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:18,563
Make arrangements

79
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,063
for my younger
son Ashok to go to Japan.

80
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,932
He will bring the child from there.

81
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:30,263
I'd rather die, but not
leave Mahesh and go to Tokyo, dad!

82
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:33,480
If I could, I would have
never let you be born in India!

83
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:35,897
Mahesh.

84
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:40,140
Oh, God! Please protect my love!

85
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,645
I will take care of your love,
right now!

86
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,230
You wear this. And you hang this.

87
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,772
Here's Rs 200.

88
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:51,353
Beat Mahesh up so badly that he
should never dare think of Sheela!

89
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:52,897
No! Listen!

90
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,563
Oh, Sheela's soft, silky sari!

91
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,813
Oh, my ladder to paradise,
take me to my beloved soon!

92
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:10,430
No, father! I won't go!
- Shut up!

93
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,730
I won't go! Mahesh!
- Shut up!

94
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:18,688
If Farhad can dig a mountain
for his love, Shirin,

95
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:21,688
can I not climb up
holding on to this sari?

96
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,353
Sheela, your slave
is at your service.

97
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,147
In fact,
the slave of slaves is here!

98
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:46,938
But, Sheela,

99
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:52,730
you appear fatter
and taller than usual.

100
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,605
Have you been on an eating binge?

101
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,270
You are nodding your head,
very much.

102
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,230
Sheela.

103
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:09,353
Ask my eternally
blessed father-in-law

104
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:14,645
to stop hovering around
our love like a pesky mosquito!

105
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:20,563
When two hearts meet,
they are oblivious.

106
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,605
But, this old mosquito
sucks the blood of our love!

107
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:32,855
'From this mosquito, learn
about cowardice and impudence.'

108
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:36,480
'When two hearts meet,
they yelp aloud at his arrogance.'

109
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:41,897
Sheela.

110
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,353
Sheela.

111
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:52,730
Why are you covering your face?

112
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,730
'Unveil your face, and before you,
will be your Mahesh.'

113
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,147
Unveil your face, Sheela.

114
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:04,897
Sheela,

115
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,688
I've been stranded with
strands of Sheela's hair!

116
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Sheela,

117
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,605
There's an army
of mosquitoes, here!

118
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:36,105
Mr Sister, take back your hair.

119
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,897
Actually,

120
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:41,897
love is blind.

121
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:45,807
Perhaps, I came to the
wrong place because I'm blind.

122
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,313
We'll make you forget about love!

123
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,897
Please, don't do that!

124
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:38,520
Chilli powder!

125
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,313
Chilli powder!

126
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:44,980
Chilli powder!

127
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,563
Hey! Finger on your nose!

128
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:06,730
Now, tell me where is my Sheela?

129
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,140
She got fed up of your love,

130
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,480
so her father is taking
her to Tokyo, tomorrow!

131
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:15,270
Tokyo?
- Don't let him go to Tokyo alone.

132
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:17,180
I'll accompany him.

133
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,938
Our Indian culture
is being slandered

134
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:23,105
due to the shameless way in
which the youngsters here roam

135
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,932
everywhere together,
before their marriage!

136
00:12:25,022 --> 00:12:26,772
You'd think, they are the direct
descendants of Romeo and Juliet!

137
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:29,063
What do you think?
- You're right.

138
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:31,980
He is conning us again, today.

139
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:33,188
You're right.

140
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:37,313
Sir, he is certainly crazy,

141
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:39,932
but, what he says makes sense.

142
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,230
You're right.

143
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:45,395
'God is showering flowers.
Thorns are being set afire.'

144
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,480
'And success stands before
me with a smile on her face.'

145
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,105
'Ladies and gentlemen, you are now'

146
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,813
'flying over the
land of the rising sun.'

147
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,730
'In a few moments,
our aircraft will land in Tokyo.'

148
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,813
'The most beautiful
city of the east.'

149
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,438
'Please, fasten your seatbelts.'

150
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:07,480
'And refrain from smoking.'

151
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:11,645
'Remain seated till the
aircraft comes to a complete halt.

152
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,980
'Thank you.'

153
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,645
I completely forgot
to give you my card.

154
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:17,980
Mine is the only shop
of its kind in Japan.

155
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,897
Indian Art Emporium!

156
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:21,980
Do contact me, if you need me.

157
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,480
And if you have the time,
then call me.

158
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:24,605
Sure!

159
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,263
'Your attention, please!'

160
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,105
'Air India passengers,
please collect your baggage from'

161
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,353
counter number 3. Thank you.'

162
00:14:22,682 --> 00:14:23,805
Send Chikoo San.

163
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:26,055
Chikoo San?

164
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:28,723
Nice name.
- But, naughty boy.

165
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:30,265
Leave me alone.

166
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,180
Chikoo San, your uncle.

167
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:39,848
Hello, Chikoo!

168
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,432
Judo expert!

169
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,888
Chikoo, good children
respect their elders.

170
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:54,930
This was only a sample, uncle.

171
00:14:55,098 --> 00:14:58,473
Do you want to take me to India?
But, I won't go!

172
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:02,055
No, I have come
to Japan to meet you.

173
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:03,973
Won't you show me around Tokyo?

174
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Let's go!

175
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,015
But, I have no money
to take you around.

176
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,223
Your uncle has plenty of money!
Let's go.

177
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,342
Will my Chikoo drink Coca Cola?

178
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,098
You will then ask me to come
to India. So, I won't drink it!

179
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:38,432
Nor will I go to India.

180
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,515
Drink it.
I will not take you to India.

181
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:42,848
Promise?
- Promise.

182
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:44,723
Indians always keep their word!

183
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:47,180
So do the Japanese!

184
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:50,307
I'll drink all
the Coca Cola you give me.

185
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,265
But I will not go to India!

186
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,055
All right!

187
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:13,805
Uncle, you're a decent man.

188
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:15,425
Why don't you stay back in Japan?

189
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,515
Because I am an Indian,
and India is my motherland.

190
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:19,557
Then, why are you taking me there?

191
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:22,723
I was born here in Japan.
So, Japan is my nation.

192
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,180
But, Chikoo, your father
was born in India.

193
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:29,888
Maybe. But my mother was
a Japanese, & I was born in Japan.

194
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:31,640
You are a sharp kid. Let's go.

195
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:35,723
Stay in Japan for a few days,
and you will become sharp too!

196
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,307
Buy any toy you want.

197
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:42,432
I can buy the entire shop for you.

198
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:43,765
Thank you, uncle.

199
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:49,473
I'll buy this, this, that one,

200
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,223
and this too!

201
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,348
Buy this also.

202
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,888
This is the Taj Mahal from India.

203
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:58,432
It's considered to be one
of the seven wonders of the world.

204
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:01,432
People from all over
the world come to see it.

205
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:02,640
Do you want to see it?

206
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:07,265
If you want to show it to me,
you'll have to bring it to Japan.

207
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:10,348
But, you won't go to India?
- I won't!

208
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,307
Just to see the Taj Mahal?

209
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:14,848
I've already seen it on television!

210
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,098
Television?

211
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:22,592
"A stranger came to my door."

212
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:27,473
"A stranger came at my door."

213
00:18:27,848 --> 00:18:32,848
"Mesmerized me with his eyes."

214
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:38,258
"Mesmerized me with his eyes."

215
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:43,390
"A stranger came at my door."

216
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:48,473
"A stranger came at my door."

217
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:24,508
"Since my innocent
childhood is over."

218
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:29,432
"My heart sways!"

219
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,508
"My heart is not in my control."

220
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:39,180
"My heart is not in my control."

221
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:47,383
"A stranger came at my door."

222
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:52,265
"A stranger came at my door."

223
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,383
"Mesmerised me with his eyes."

224
00:19:57,473 --> 00:20:02,473
"A stranger came at my door."

225
00:20:28,848 --> 00:20:33,765
"Sleepless are the nights."

226
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:38,848
"I remember of him."

227
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:43,848
"I spend the night
counting the stars."

228
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:48,598
"I spend the night counting stars."

229
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:56,798
"A stranger came at my door."

230
00:20:56,888 --> 00:21:01,715
"A stranger came at my door."

231
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:06,640
"Mesmerised me with his eyes."

232
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:11,598
"Mesmerised me with his eyes."

233
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:16,550
"A stranger came at my door."

234
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,805
"A stranger came at my door."

235
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:26,723
A stranger came at my door.

236
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,640
Mesmerised me with his eyes.

237
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:31,765
Ladies and gentlemen.

238
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,888
This was a signal
that after some time

239
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:38,223
girls have some lovely dreams.

240
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:42,930
Being an uncle I'm not
ignorant about my responsibility.

241
00:21:43,805 --> 00:21:47,473
As per my deceased brother's will

242
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,805
a decent, well educated

243
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:54,140
simple prince charming

244
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:58,432
who is a pilot officer

245
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:02,307
will marry Ms Asha and thereby,
I will fulfil my duty.

246
00:22:03,348 --> 00:22:04,805
Please come, Mr Pran.

247
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:06,805
Mr Pran.

248
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:11,473
Uncle.

249
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:21,008
Indian girls begin to blush
on hearing about marriage.

250
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,390
Mr Anderson!
- Yes!

251
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,805
Please, read my brother's
will and letter.

252
00:22:25,307 --> 00:22:27,765
I've got it, but let Ms Asha come.

253
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:44,432
Dad, I have obeyed you all my life.

254
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,723
But, I am compelled to disobey
what's written in your will.

255
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:55,805
Please forgive me, dad.
I hate Pran!

256
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:58,640
I hate the very sight of him!

257
00:23:00,015 --> 00:23:01,888
You'll have to turn
the hatred into love

258
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,348
because, it's all decided.
- Uncle!

259
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,015
You are my uncle.

260
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:13,682
Why do you want me
to marry a man I hate?

261
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,848
I know what's good
or bad for you, Asha.

262
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:21,467
Then, tell me a single
good quality that Pran has!

263
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:24,015
What does Mr Pran lack? Tell me.

264
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:27,098
He's decent, handsome and educated!

265
00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:29,848
It's you whom he loves.
Not your wealth.

266
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:34,140
I know, that it's
only my wealth he loves!

267
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,682
Stop talking rubbish!

268
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,930
I have promised your father.

269
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:42,765
It's my life's biggest aim to
abide by my elder brother's will.

270
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,307
Asha! This engagement
will take place, right now!

271
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,640
Go and change.
The guests are waiting for you.

272
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,515
Please, don't give the
world a chance to mock at you.

273
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:57,473
Come on, try to be a sport. Please.

274
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:07,723
Pran, the situation is delicate.

275
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,515
Asha is not prepared to marry you.

276
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,723
And until she gives her consent

277
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:17,515
the lawyer won't give
us my deceased brother's letter!

278
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:21,930
Until we get the letter,
our luck won't change!

279
00:24:22,805 --> 00:24:25,805
An equal share of the
inheritance is impossible!

280
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,432
And if we don't get that soon

281
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,973
our gangsters will surely kill us.

282
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,307
I'll go and pacify Asha.

283
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,640
Just hurry!

284
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:54,515
Asha, I worship your anger!

285
00:24:54,888 --> 00:24:57,715
But at least respond to the knock
of a man who pines for your love.

286
00:24:57,805 --> 00:25:00,682
Dad, please forgive me.

287
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,265
If you still don't reply,
then I'll come inside.

288
00:25:04,557 --> 00:25:05,515
So, don't be offended.

289
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:12,805
Uncle makes a mountain
out of a molehill!

290
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,015
Asha, these clothes
bear a lingering perfume.

291
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,805
People are waiting for us.

292
00:25:23,598 --> 00:25:24,888
Change your clothes
and come quickly.

293
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:30,223
Do put a black beauty
spot on your cheek.

294
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,432
To ward off the evil eyes!

295
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:41,180
'Uncle, I hate Pran!'

296
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,515
'I certainly don't want
to get married to him.'

297
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,723
'Therefore,
I'm leaving your house.'

298
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:02,873
Ladies and gentlemen, the attitude
of Indian girls is quite strange.

299
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,538
Asha loves her uncle dearly.

300
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,830
The moment he spoke
of her engagement

301
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:12,830
she went away, at the thought
of being separated from her uncle.

302
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,992
The fortunate person
who finds her...

303
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:19,455
Will be rewarded $5,000!

304
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,040
Fifty percent from me.

305
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,623
And 50% of it will be from Pran.

306
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:26,830
'If I escape from here'

307
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,705
'my uncle will not
be able to take me to India.'

308
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:35,790
'I wish, I could find you!
I'd hide you in my heart.'

309
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:52,332
Chikoo.

310
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:39,580
Don't try to deceive Chikoo
by speaking in Japanese!

311
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:43,915
I know, that you are
an Indian girl on the run.

312
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:45,623
Your name is Asha.

313
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,873
How do you know?

314
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,790
All of Japan knows!

315
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:51,248
It's been aired on TV

316
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:55,455
that anyone who
finds you will be rewarded.

317
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:58,998
Should I call the police?
- No. Please, don't!

318
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:02,373
You want a reward, don't you?
Here, take some money.

319
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:09,415
No way! I don't
take money from girls!

320
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,957
But, in spite of
being an Indian girl

321
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:15,455
why did you escape from home?

322
00:28:15,748 --> 00:28:17,207
Because of my uncle!

323
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:19,123
Your uncle?

324
00:28:19,373 --> 00:28:23,538
Yes. He's coercing me to
get married and I don't want to.

325
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:26,538
All uncles are bad!

326
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:30,623
Even my uncle wants to
force me to go to India

327
00:28:30,873 --> 00:28:32,373
but, I won't go!

328
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:36,998
Where are your parents, Chikoo?
In Japan or in India?

329
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:51,455
God took both of them.

330
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,705
I have nobody. I'm all alone!

331
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:01,207
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,082
There are many people
like you in this world.

333
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:07,580
I have nobody, too.

334
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,373
Why does God call everybody?

335
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:16,748
Not everybody, but only
those whom He considers good.

336
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:22,040
Then, why does He not call me?
Am I not good?

337
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:26,123
No, Chikoo!
Please, don't speak that way.

338
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:31,040
Am I not a nice girl?
Then, why didn't He call me?

339
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:35,748
Why didn't He call you?

340
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,825
Because, He wanted us to meet.

341
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:42,373
When He severs off one
relationship, He forms another.

342
00:29:42,957 --> 00:29:45,283
Have you actually come
from the abode of God?

343
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:48,538
Yes. Now, that we have met,
we will never be separated.

344
00:29:49,332 --> 00:29:50,998
Promise?
- Promise!

345
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,123
Hey, partner. Get up, it's morning.

346
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,830
Wake up.

347
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:11,332
Wait, partner. What if,
somebody recognises you, then?

348
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:16,165
If there's any danger,
then I'll whistle this way.

349
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,248
Chikoo. Chikoo.

350
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,290
Chikoo.

351
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,623
Chikoo.

352
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:07,957
Chikoo.

353
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:13,665
Thank you, partner.

354
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:16,123
Partner, I'm starving.

355
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:19,123
Let's go to a tea
house and have tea.

356
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:27,123
Come here.

357
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,623
Partner, they've recognised you.

358
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:58,165
They are speaking in Japanese.

359
00:32:58,373 --> 00:32:59,998
They may call the police.

360
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:01,498
Let's scoot!
- Okay.

361
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,248
The car's ready.

362
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:45,580
Let go of my hand!

363
00:33:45,915 --> 00:33:47,575
I believe,
the legendary Prithviraj eloped

364
00:33:47,665 --> 00:33:49,332
with his Samyukta on a horse.

365
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,538
Today, I will elope with
my beloved in a car. Come on.

366
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,207
Leave me!
- Come on!

367
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,665
Leave me!

368
00:33:57,207 --> 00:33:58,957
Let go of me!
- Sit quietly!

369
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,873
Mom!

370
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,623
Help! Help!

371
00:34:50,957 --> 00:34:53,082
Help! - Hey, what's wrong? Get up!

372
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,957
I've broken my leg!

373
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:57,740
What?
- And my hand too!

374
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,207
What? Let me see!

375
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,455
Was that your broken hand?

376
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:07,415
Wait!

377
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:13,748
Stop the car.

378
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:17,408
What is it?

379
00:35:17,498 --> 00:35:21,873
You saved me once,
and now, I've saved you.

380
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:24,248
So, that's quits.

381
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:26,873
It's time to say bye, now.
- But, why?

382
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:31,705
Your Indian sari will
get me arrested, with you!

383
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:34,448
Chikoo, if you have
promised to be my partner

384
00:35:34,538 --> 00:35:35,408
you have to stand by me!

385
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:38,957
Then, disguise yourself.
Wear something else.

386
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,082
Take me to a department store.

387
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:45,830
Straight ahead is an Indian
ready-made garments store.

388
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:47,790
Grand idea!

389
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,207
Let's go.

390
00:35:50,498 --> 00:35:51,533
Good morning!

391
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,325
Good afternoon,
good afternoon, boy!

392
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:55,455
Shopping mall, fantastic.

393
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,665
Aunt, is he a goat,
or is his face that way?

394
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:00,665
He's got a sprain in the neck.

395
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:02,580
They are meek in India

396
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,200
but, once they come abroad,
they get all high and mighty!

397
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,365
Okay, get out, get out lunch time.

398
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,082
Is this the way
to speak to customers?

399
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:11,290
Okay, get out,
don't teach me. - Let's go.

400
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:12,748
I'm very sorry, ma'am.

401
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,998
I'm very sorry, dear boy.
Please come in.

402
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:18,998
Thank you!
- This way.

403
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:23,748
Consider this your shop.
Choose whatever you want.

404
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,248
Boss, please let me go!
Settle my pay.

405
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:39,290
You have insulted
me before my countrymen!

406
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:41,332
And I can't digest that!

407
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:44,455
Even your dad will digest that.

408
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:48,998
She is the girl who bears
a reward of $5,000 on her head!

409
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,700
The girl on television?
- Yes.

410
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,998
We'll divide it two ways.
I'll make the call.

411
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:56,790
What's with this bell.

412
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,290
Hello. Who is it? Ashok?

413
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:02,830
Oh, no! If your nephew is lost,
what can the boss do?

414
00:37:04,415 --> 00:37:07,290
Come to the shop and speak.
Put the phone down.

415
00:37:08,165 --> 00:37:09,830
Boss, call up Mr Pran.

416
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:27,607
What? Asha is in your store?
- Yes!

417
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,273
Bring $5000 in cash.

418
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,813
Keep her waiting there.
I'll get you the cash.

419
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,230
Important business, darling.
See you later.

420
00:37:38,938 --> 00:37:42,355
Lock the trial room,
and keep an eye on them.

421
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:45,398
$5000.

422
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,938
Hey, mister! Have you gone
blind after coming to Japan?

423
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:34,398
I'm sorry, I'm very worked up.

424
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,480
My brother's son is missing.
He's also her age.

425
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:40,368
You talk as though
she's your nephew!

426
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:41,618
But, this is a girl.

427
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,450
Thank God,
you could at least distinguish

428
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:45,658
between a girl and a boy.

429
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:47,118
You appear quite interesting.

430
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,200
You're not bad yourself.

431
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,160
Thank you.
- Why thank me?

432
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,610
If you'd been a girl,
I'd have abducted you! - Is it?

433
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,618
And your uncle would
have been searching for you!

434
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:01,950
Hey, mister! You called me,
so where are you going?

435
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:03,160
Where's the girl?

436
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:04,742
Girl?

437
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:08,950
Oh! Hey mister,
he wants to ask you something.

438
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:16,410
Here's your reward.
Send the girl outside, immediately.

439
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,783
What? Who do you think I am?

440
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:23,535
You called me and now
you're talking rubbish. Idiot!

441
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,450
Oh! So, you are the duffer

442
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:30,110
who announced $5,000
on TV for his younger sister?

443
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,700
She must be your younger sister!
She is my future wife!

444
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:37,070
Wife! If this is the state before
marriage, imagine the future!

445
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,742
What?
- Sir!

446
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,700
Please, stop arguing and come here.

447
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:45,410
Excuse me, sir,
have you seen a small boy here?

448
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:47,950
You announce a reward too,
and you'll find the boy!

449
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:50,028
Mohan! Where the heck is he?

450
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:52,368
No problem, I have a duplicate key.

451
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:55,742
Take your lover away.

452
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:01,410
You may hide from
the moon and the stars, Asha.

453
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,950
But you can't hide from
the gaze of those who love you.

454
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,577
Asha!

455
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:07,243
Hey!

456
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,320
You're a boy!
Why are you wearing a sari?

457
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,450
Your dad has cheated
me out of $5,000!

458
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,445
He must be your dad!
He's an equal partner.

459
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:15,610
Where's the girl
whose sari this is?

460
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,110
That girl was
completely overwhelming!

461
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,818
So was that boy!

462
00:40:19,908 --> 00:40:21,200
You fool!

463
00:40:21,868 --> 00:40:23,658
Sir! Sir!

464
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:26,033
Hey, give me my money!

465
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,493
Mahesh!

466
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,742
For how long will you test my love?

467
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,493
Even my tears have dried,
crying in your memory!

468
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,325
Won't you come to Tokyo?

469
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,110
Is your love for me not true,
Mahesh?

470
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,950
You are lying, you rascal!

471
00:40:56,325 --> 00:40:57,700
Ashok is not like that.

472
00:40:58,243 --> 00:41:02,950
Mother if you want, then I'll
touch your feet and say

473
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,868
that Ashok was clinging to
a Japanese girl at the airport!

474
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:10,618
Even a ray of light
could not pass through them!

475
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:13,618
Yes. He was all smiles
while talking with her.

476
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,325
Are you telling the truth?

477
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:19,368
Mother! Do you think I'd
want to get killed by lying to you?

478
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:21,742
But, I fail to
understand one thing.

479
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:26,652
Your family and Japan
seem to have an eternal enmity.

480
00:41:26,742 --> 00:41:28,410
No wonder, you keep
clashing every now and then!

481
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:34,118
Some years ago,
your older son went to Japan alone.

482
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:36,577
He never returned.

483
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:40,285
Now, Ashok has gone to Japan alone.

484
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,618
God alone knows what will happen!
- Mahesh!

485
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:46,118
Why don't you also go to Tokyo?

486
00:41:47,033 --> 00:41:50,118
The moment the child is found,
bring back both of them safely.

487
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:52,658
I will make arrangements
for your trip.

488
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,243
Mother,

489
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:57,658
Money is
a temporary possession, mom.

490
00:41:58,118 --> 00:42:02,908
In a few days, I have the annual
Board of Directors' meeting.

491
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:05,658
How can l go? Of course,
my passport is ready.

492
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:09,868
Can't you make such a small
sacrifice for your friend?

493
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:14,403
Mother, your words have
provoked my dormant decency

494
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:16,410
and my spirited friendship!

495
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,535
Now, I must go to Tokyo anyhow!

496
00:42:19,742 --> 00:42:22,825
Even if it incurs heavy losses
or completely destroys me.

497
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,075
I have to go for my love.
I mean, for my friend.

498
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,410
I'll teach you a lesson, now.

499
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:34,118
Chikoo! No!

500
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,993
You brat! What have you worn?

501
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,735
Aren't you ashamed of
indulging in such acts abroad?

502
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,160
What have I done?

503
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:45,325
You took away my Chikoo!

504
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:48,568
What are you talking about?
The chikoo that we eat?

505
00:42:48,658 --> 00:42:49,742
My nephew! Chikoo.

506
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:54,033
Is your nephew a treasure
which I would take away?

507
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,535
I took pity on the child and
fed him and yet you boss around!

508
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,033
Great, great.

509
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,118
You took away my nephew,
and yet you are acting so smart!

510
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,243
At the store, you told
me that this child is a girl!

511
00:43:04,493 --> 00:43:06,652
While you are feed him!
Should I call the police?

512
00:43:06,742 --> 00:43:07,742
Go ahead!

513
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:09,618
Police!

514
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:13,535
In spite of being
from the same country

515
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,868
why are you calling the police?

516
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:18,410
I see! So, you think of your
country, now! You are frightened!

517
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:26,950
Thank God, there is no fracture.
- Thank you, doctor.

518
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:30,568
Now, boy, India fly!

519
00:43:30,658 --> 00:43:33,368
Oh! Not for 15 days.

520
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:35,868
The child has weak bones.

521
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:41,118
All right, I'll leave now.

522
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,278
If you talk about leaving

523
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:46,825
I'll tell uncle
that you are not a man!

524
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,278
That you're the
girl who has run away.

525
00:43:49,368 --> 00:43:51,577
No! Chikoo.
- Uncle!

526
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:54,285
This person is not a real Sikh!

527
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:58,033
What? He isn't?

528
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,825
I promised that,
I would remain with him.

529
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,700
But, now that I'm going away,
he says, I'm not a real Sikh!

530
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,535
Right, son?

531
00:44:07,243 --> 00:44:10,658
He's right.
Sikhs never go back on their word.

532
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:12,243
You've made a promise, abide by it.

533
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:15,568
Chikoo, your dear Sardarji
will not go away.

534
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:16,568
Promise!

535
00:44:16,658 --> 00:44:17,993
Promise!
- That's it!

536
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,118
Chikoo, have the
soup and go to sleep.

537
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:26,160
You won't feed me.

538
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:28,658
You won't?
- Never!

539
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,200
Did you see that?

540
00:44:30,658 --> 00:44:33,618
This child seems to be my uncle,
and I am his nephew!

541
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:36,075
One needs to explain to a child,
very lovingly!

542
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,950
Provided he'd give me
a chance to be loving, wretch!

543
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,200
I go close to him, and he hits me!

544
00:44:45,868 --> 00:44:46,868
Incredible!

545
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:50,368
He hails from my family but,
you are feeding him the soup.

546
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:53,200
Go on, have some more!

547
00:44:56,868 --> 00:44:57,908
I won't have it, indeed!

548
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,118
He's upset!

549
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,200
It's no use reading
a book on child psychology.

550
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,908
Well, you tell me what to do!

551
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:18,742
I'm a decent man.

552
00:45:18,993 --> 00:45:20,535
I've never been in
love or been married.

553
00:45:20,783 --> 00:45:21,993
So how can I have children?

554
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:25,825
You must have at least
seen some lovely maidens?

555
00:45:26,118 --> 00:45:28,618
I could sight no
lovely maiden in India.

556
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:30,493
But yes!

557
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:34,368
There was a lovely Indian
maiden on Japanese television.

558
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:36,160
But even she has run away!

559
00:45:36,493 --> 00:45:37,950
Reaching for someone so distant?

560
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,658
Can you not see someone
who is so close?

561
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,618
The same eyes!

562
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:46,493
You have eyes just like that girl!

563
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,618
Do you have a sister in Japan?
Please, introduce me to her!

564
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,950
I live in India.
I'm the only son of my parents.

565
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:56,950
Consider me to be their
son and daughter, as well!

566
00:45:57,285 --> 00:45:59,033
Forget it, there's no hope.

567
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,033
But, what do you do in Japan?

568
00:46:02,618 --> 00:46:05,825
I am writing a book on love.

569
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:09,200
I want to do a PhD in romance.

570
00:46:09,658 --> 00:46:11,118
Give me some advice, too.

571
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:15,742
What do you think love is, buddy?
Sweet pudding?

572
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:17,908
Which you can taste
if you get the chance?

573
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:20,033
Show me your hand.
- Here!

574
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:25,403
You do have a love line.
You will get the girl.

575
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:26,825
I will?
- Yes.

576
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:30,243
If you do get her, it will be
only after she twirls you around.

577
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,577
Thank you!

578
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,825
Sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.

579
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,450
Where are you going?

580
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:39,285
Out of the room.

581
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,658
This is such a big bed.
Both of us will sleep here.

582
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,618
We will talk all night.

583
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:49,860
I snore loudly at night.
You will not be able to sleep.

584
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:51,868
Stop it and wear this sarong!

585
00:46:52,868 --> 00:46:53,868
No!

586
00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:00,160
You blush like a girl!

587
00:47:00,285 --> 00:47:02,160
You don't understand.

588
00:47:02,618 --> 00:47:06,200
Chikoo is unwell. If he wakes
up at night, it'll be a problem.

589
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:10,700
Please wait.

590
00:47:18,118 --> 00:47:19,908
I will be indebted to you, forever.

591
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:22,195
If not for you,
who would have tended to

592
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:23,700
that adamant and ill child?

593
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,908
I've had to look after,
not one, but two children!

594
00:47:37,783 --> 00:47:40,403
Oh God, may a blind
man come here today

595
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:42,243
who will empty his pockets

596
00:47:42,368 --> 00:47:43,993
but, not take
a thing from the store!

597
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:49,075
'A hermit stands here wishing
only well for everyone.'

598
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:53,528
'He seeks not a friend or a foe.'

599
00:47:53,618 --> 00:47:54,950
Get lost from here!

600
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:57,658
If you want to die,
then jump from Tokyo Tower!

601
00:47:57,825 --> 00:48:00,742
You seek well of others,
but are destroying my store!

602
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,868
Destruction is imminent, my child!

603
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:10,818
What nonsense?
- It's not nonsense!

604
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:16,993
You paid Rs 200 instead of Rs
500 and ended an innocent love!

605
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:20,868
In Japan?
- No. In India.

606
00:48:21,075 --> 00:48:23,825
In Mumbai! In the Tanker colony.

607
00:48:24,993 --> 00:48:26,493
Has the Mahesh murder
case been opened?

608
00:48:26,618 --> 00:48:29,320
The Indian police have
already left from India.

609
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,235
What? Please stop talking.
Have you eaten?

610
00:48:33,325 --> 00:48:34,778
Have I eaten?

611
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:37,195
'When the truth began to scare you'

612
00:48:37,285 --> 00:48:39,285
'you started to
give away in charity!'

613
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:41,652
No, that's not so. Please come in.

614
00:48:41,742 --> 00:48:42,985
If you want me to come in

615
00:48:43,075 --> 00:48:44,783
then, you may as well
take me inside your house.

616
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:47,195
My home is inside the store.

617
00:48:47,285 --> 00:48:48,568
Really?

618
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:51,993
What are you doing, sir?
Why are you taking a hermit in?

619
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:55,658
How did a hermit from the sacred
plains of India come to Tokyo?

620
00:48:57,742 --> 00:48:59,160
Foolish creature!

621
00:49:00,075 --> 00:49:04,993
Your daughter's admirer
has passed away!

622
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:06,070
I see...

623
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,658
But now, he slowly moves towards

624
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:15,278
your neck, in the form of a noose.

625
00:49:15,368 --> 00:49:17,285
No, I don't want to die!

626
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,993
There is a vast inheritance,
my daughter is young.

627
00:49:20,118 --> 00:49:23,033
I have come here to make
the necessary arrangements.

628
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,028
Tell me a remedy, father.
- Whom are you calling father?

629
00:49:26,118 --> 00:49:28,243
You.
- Call my father that!

630
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,943
I'm an ascetic.

631
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,903
Okay, sage.
Please, tell me a remedy.

632
00:49:31,993 --> 00:49:33,243
There is a remedy.

633
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,535
Slip into a river and chant...
- Tell me.

634
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,950
'In a river, a hermit slips.'

635
00:49:40,118 --> 00:49:41,818
'In a river, a hermit slips.'

636
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:43,320
'Best wishes for everyone
Is all that he has on his lips.'

637
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,070
'Best wishes for everyone
is all that he has on his lips.'

638
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,450
'Finally I befriend Mahesh,
enmity there remains none now!'

639
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,993
Come on now,
getting going to the riverside!

640
00:50:03,075 --> 00:50:04,075
Hello.

641
00:50:06,538 --> 00:50:08,160
I want the police station.

642
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,818
Is this the police station?

643
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:12,028
Look, my father-in-law
is about to commit suicide.

644
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:15,070
I'll speak in English.
Listen! My son-in-law...

645
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,243
No, no, my father-in-law
is committing suicide.

646
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,493
Yes, suicide, dying. River. Yes!

647
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:23,618
What? My name?

648
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,700
India's James Bond.

649
00:50:30,118 --> 00:50:32,908
Brother of Brook Bond, Mahesh.

650
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,700
My charming magician.

651
00:50:35,868 --> 00:50:40,160
My father is getting me married
to that dark oaf, Chatterjee!

652
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:44,325
Rescue me!
- Bless you, beautiful maiden!

653
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,033
Can I get some alms
in the name of God?

654
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,818
Give me some alms,
in the name of the Lord, my Queen!

655
00:50:49,908 --> 00:50:52,908
Why barge inside the house?
Go to the store and ask father!

656
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:57,118
It's a grave sin to send
a hermit empty-handed, my queen!

657
00:50:57,243 --> 00:50:59,075
Hey! Stop addressing
me as your queen!

658
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:02,325
I said, ask father! Stop asking me!

659
00:51:03,535 --> 00:51:06,825
Some alms is what I asked for.

660
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:10,950
But, you refused.

661
00:51:11,075 --> 00:51:13,200
You are stooping, so low!

662
00:51:14,118 --> 00:51:16,033
You deceive God by
pretending to be a hermit!

663
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,325
It's no big deal deceiving God.

664
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:23,868
But, a man in love cannot
deceive his loved one, you fool.

665
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,783
Hey! My loved one!

666
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,700
"I long for your love.
What else do I say?"

667
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:50,075
"I long for your love.
What else do I say?"

668
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:56,568
"I am your admirer.
What else do I say?"

669
00:51:56,658 --> 00:52:02,908
"I long for your love.
What else do I say?"

670
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:29,493
"Recognise me, I am your beloved."

671
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:37,610
"Recognise me, I am your beloved."

672
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:44,160
"When will you shower
your grace on me?"

673
00:52:44,368 --> 00:52:47,285
"I am your admirer."

674
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,528
"I am your admirer."

675
00:52:50,618 --> 00:52:53,368
"I am your admirer."

676
00:53:00,285 --> 00:53:02,278
"I am your admirer."

677
00:53:02,368 --> 00:53:06,652
"I have offended you,
what else do I say?"

678
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:13,200
"I long for your love
what else do I say?"

679
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:33,368
"I have come here with a desire."

680
00:53:35,075 --> 00:53:41,568
"I have come here with a desire."

681
00:53:41,658 --> 00:53:48,118
"I have come to
Japan for your sake."

682
00:53:48,285 --> 00:53:51,243
"I am your beloved."

683
00:53:51,493 --> 00:53:54,568
"I am your beloved."

684
00:53:54,658 --> 00:53:57,285
"I am your beloved."

685
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:06,320
"I am your beloved."

686
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:10,652
"I desire you. What else do I say?"

687
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:17,618
"I long for your love,
what else do I say?"

688
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:44,742
"Without you,
my heart feels lonely."

689
00:54:45,742 --> 00:54:52,200
"Without you,
my heart feels lonely."

690
00:54:52,368 --> 00:54:58,778
"Though defamed,
it belongs to you."

691
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:01,868
"I am hurt..."

692
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:05,243
"I am hurt..."

693
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,993
"I am hurt..."

694
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:16,693
"I am hurt..."

695
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:21,325
"In a big way, what else do I say?"

696
00:55:21,493 --> 00:55:27,783
"I long for your love.
What else do I say?"

697
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,325
"I am your admirer,
what else do I say?"

698
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:40,825
"I long for your love,
what else do I say?"

699
00:55:52,742 --> 00:55:55,700
Why did the hermit ever ask
me to take a dip in a cold river?

700
00:55:56,658 --> 00:55:58,075
'In a river, a hermit dips.'

701
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,783
'Best wishes is all
that he has on his lips.'

702
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:03,450
'Finally I befriend Mahesh,
enmity there remains none now!'

703
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:10,577
'Finally I befriend Mahesh,
enmity there remains none!'

704
00:56:14,285 --> 00:56:15,908
Good Lord! The police!

705
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,285
Mahesh is no more,
but, he's put the police behind me!

706
00:56:26,493 --> 00:56:28,033
Oh, God.

707
00:56:42,493 --> 00:56:44,493
I'm praying to God. No suicide.

708
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:48,445
Mahesh called you?

709
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,160
Mahesh is here, in Tokyo?
- Yes.

710
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:55,118
Mahesh, you should leave now.
Father may be here soon.

711
00:56:55,950 --> 00:57:00,577
Your father must be freezing
in the cold river.

712
00:57:00,908 --> 00:57:05,783
He must be sneezing in the Japanese
jail after being captured by cops.

713
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:10,658
He sneezes in the jail of Japan

714
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:12,410
and its sound
can be heard right here!

715
00:57:12,618 --> 00:57:14,325
Is that a sneeze
or a supersonic jet?

716
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:20,160
That's father sneezing!
- Goodness me!

717
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:25,577
Where is that rogue?

718
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,950
Dad, you've caught a cold.

719
00:57:28,075 --> 00:57:30,577
And where is that rogue?

720
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:36,160
Take some medicine.
- Where is that rogue Mahesh?

721
00:57:38,577 --> 00:57:41,028
I'll kill you!

722
00:57:41,118 --> 00:57:42,658
Sheela, I'll see you later!

723
00:57:42,825 --> 00:57:44,200
Dad!

724
00:57:44,535 --> 00:57:47,618
Wait! I'll fix you! Wait!

725
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,993
Mahesh, here?

726
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:17,528
Your death has
brought you to Japan.

727
00:58:17,618 --> 00:58:19,278
I won't spare you, today!

728
00:58:19,368 --> 00:58:21,658
Wait! Here I come!

729
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:33,825
Mahesh!
- Ashok. Who is Mahesh?

730
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,868
I don't know how my friend,
Mahesh, is here.

731
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:37,993
His future father-in-law
is pursuing him with a revolver.

732
00:58:38,243 --> 00:58:40,285
But, where are you going?
- To find him.

733
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:43,033
But, that leads to the
Geisha house. - So what?

734
00:58:43,493 --> 00:58:45,493
Believe me, it's not a nice place.

735
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:48,368
I'm going to find my friend,
not a geisha.

736
00:58:48,783 --> 00:58:52,195
Sisters! My Japanese sisters!

737
00:58:52,285 --> 00:58:55,325
Save me!
Rescue my Sheela's beloved!

738
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,993
Her father is coming to shoot me!

739
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,368
Didn't you get me? With the pistol.

740
00:59:04,243 --> 00:59:05,450
Where's he?

741
00:59:11,658 --> 00:59:14,070
You here?
You seem a guardian angel here!

742
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,243
Indeed. This place is such.

743
00:59:16,493 --> 00:59:19,577
Where humans cannot tread,
only angels like me do!

744
00:59:20,368 --> 00:59:21,868
Have you come here
to find your nephew?

745
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:25,993
I found him. God bless this
man because of whom I found him.

746
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,535
He's a great palmist, too.

747
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,950
Please, sir.

748
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:32,700
Ease my troubles, too.

749
00:59:33,075 --> 00:59:37,075
Read his hand, too.
I'll look for my friend and return.

750
00:59:37,285 --> 00:59:38,742
He seems to be in big trouble.

751
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:42,903
Sit down! Here.

752
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:44,993
Girls everywhere!

753
00:59:45,993 --> 00:59:47,658
I wonder where that rogue has gone?

754
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:51,075
It concerns wealth.

755
00:59:51,243 --> 00:59:53,033
That girl is so rich

756
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,450
that one can buy all
of the world's lovely maidens!

757
00:59:55,618 --> 00:59:57,993
Then, you will surely get her.

758
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,950
I will?
- Yes.

759
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,368
But, only when you will
be breathing your last!

760
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:08,160
Take back your last words!

761
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,410
I can't even die,
unless I get that girl.

762
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,577
No!

763
01:00:41,742 --> 01:00:42,783
No!

764
01:01:28,368 --> 01:01:30,243
Beloved.

765
01:01:31,118 --> 01:01:32,825
Beloved.

766
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:37,783
Whose voice beckoned me in Japan?
It drives me insane!

767
01:01:38,285 --> 01:01:42,118
The one who beckoned you
is none other than your grandpa!

768
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:53,903
Please, don't leave me alone.

769
01:01:53,993 --> 01:01:56,160
Hey! Do you speak Hindi?

770
01:01:58,908 --> 01:02:02,368
I'm an international geisha.

771
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:05,285
International geisha.
- Yes!

772
01:02:06,993 --> 01:02:13,658
So, I can speak Hindi,
Gujarati and Marathi.

773
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,577
Now, sit here.

774
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,368
You all sit here.

775
01:02:29,742 --> 01:02:33,618
Sir, now, remove your cap.

776
01:02:43,825 --> 01:02:44,825
Sake.

777
01:02:46,658 --> 01:02:50,783
Why are you looking the other way?
Look at me, also.

778
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:53,993
You are a linguist!

779
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:57,410
International geisha.

780
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,950
I see.

781
01:02:59,658 --> 01:03:03,320
So, do you know to recite
some couplets of India, too?

782
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,450
Yes.

783
01:03:06,618 --> 01:03:09,700
Will you reply to the
couplet which I will recite?

784
01:03:09,868 --> 01:03:10,868
Yes.

785
01:03:12,033 --> 01:03:13,535
Okay.

786
01:03:14,410 --> 01:03:16,285
Then, listen.
- Okay.

787
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,658
'All night, I boiled an egg.'

788
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:24,243
Darling!
'All night I boiled an egg.'

789
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:26,568
'Yet uncooked, it remained.'

790
01:03:26,658 --> 01:03:30,950
'Poets have been long dead,
only stupid fools have remained.'

791
01:03:32,783 --> 01:03:35,908
A superb reply!
Now, for the next one.

792
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:37,118
Yes.

793
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:44,535
'Sunlight was spread far and wide.'

794
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,285
'Sunlight was spread far and wide.'

795
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:53,658
'There was water on every side.'

796
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:56,993
'When you were brought
into life here.'

797
01:03:57,368 --> 01:04:02,033
'Your father laughed aloud
but your mother shed tears.'

798
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,493
My international love.

799
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:08,825
Stay away.
- 'Stay away.'

800
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,200
Sake.

801
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,410
Gone.

802
01:04:36,658 --> 01:04:38,825
Okay, there you go.

803
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:49,327
No more!

804
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:51,793
Give me the whole box!

805
01:04:52,293 --> 01:04:54,543
If you eat all of it,
you'll fall ill!

806
01:04:55,293 --> 01:04:57,877
Then, I will not do
this in front of uncle!

807
01:04:58,252 --> 01:04:59,752
Please, Chikoo!

808
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:01,752
Give me the whole box, then!

809
01:05:02,085 --> 01:05:03,668
All right, take it!

810
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,168
Aunt, may I ask you something?
- Yes.

811
01:05:08,627 --> 01:05:11,543
Why all this charade?
- There's no special reason.

812
01:05:12,293 --> 01:05:13,752
Can I tell you?
- Yes.

813
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:19,752
Aunt and uncle...
- Quiet! Go to sleep!

814
01:05:27,043 --> 01:05:30,502
'A lovely Indian maiden did
appear on Japanese television.'

815
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:32,418
'But even she has run away!'

816
01:05:32,585 --> 01:05:36,502
I long to show you my true self.

817
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,918
But believe me,

818
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:43,960
I will torment you
after becoming Chikoo's aunt.

819
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,163
Uncle.
- Who is it, Chikoo?

820
01:05:48,413 --> 01:05:50,122
Your aunt!

821
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:52,538
My aunt?

822
01:05:53,372 --> 01:05:55,905
Fool! Not his aunt, but yours!

823
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:58,080
Not your aunt, but mine!

824
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,540
Coming!

825
01:06:07,915 --> 01:06:10,873
Good morning!
- What good morning?

826
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:18,873
Chikoo, where did this
troublesome aunt come from?

827
01:06:19,038 --> 01:06:24,623
What? You call me troublesome!
I know Hindi!

828
01:06:24,955 --> 01:06:26,955
I learnt from your brother.

829
01:06:27,205 --> 01:06:29,582
I was going to report
at the police station.

830
01:06:29,832 --> 01:06:31,873
But, I learnt that he was here.

831
01:06:32,373 --> 01:06:34,290
At the police station? Why?

832
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:38,290
How could you abduct him?
I will take him away!

833
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:41,457
Abduct?
He's my older brother's son.

834
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:42,865
Right, Chikoo?
- Yes, uncle.

835
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:46,707
He's my older sister's son. Right?

836
01:06:46,998 --> 01:06:48,582
Yes, aunt!

837
01:06:48,998 --> 01:06:51,998
Aunt, uncle.
- You shut up!

838
01:06:52,165 --> 01:06:55,123
I'm the one who raised you!

839
01:06:55,498 --> 01:06:58,205
I wonder from where
your uncle came!

840
01:06:58,457 --> 01:07:01,248
I will not let you take to India.

841
01:07:01,665 --> 01:07:04,700
Ma'am, I have sought the permission
of the Japanese government.

842
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,998
I will have it cancelled!

843
01:07:07,205 --> 01:07:10,623
He does not want to go to India.
Am I right, Chikoo?

844
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:15,123
This is a matter of my honour.
Say yes, at least today.

845
01:07:15,373 --> 01:07:17,955
No! I will stay with aunt!

846
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,915
You're from my bloodline

847
01:07:21,123 --> 01:07:22,115
but, you'll stay with your aunt?

848
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,498
While you let a Sikh feed you soup!

849
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,748
Chikoo, let's go.

850
01:07:27,248 --> 01:07:28,990
Bye.
- Bye?

851
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,248
Step out of the hotel,
and I'll break your leg!

852
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:35,623
He is my love. Let's go, Chikoo.

853
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,330
Hey, you lousy aunt!

854
01:07:37,498 --> 01:07:40,582
What? You called me a lousy aunt!

855
01:07:40,748 --> 01:07:43,123
Yes, I did!

856
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:46,533
I have never ever
killed even a chicken.

857
01:07:46,623 --> 01:07:51,240
But, if you take him away,
I'll wring your neck!

858
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:54,790
If you murder me,
then I will call the police!

859
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:55,915
Police!

860
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,990
Ma'am, I haven't
actually murdered you!

861
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,283
Aunt, call the police.
I'll testify against uncle.

862
01:08:04,373 --> 01:08:06,290
Where are you going?

863
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:09,408
Such a tiny being,
and you will testify!

864
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:11,205
Will the cops listen
to your testimony?

865
01:08:15,415 --> 01:08:16,498
My friend!

866
01:08:19,707 --> 01:08:21,832
My friend!

867
01:08:22,415 --> 01:08:24,080
Wake up, soon!
The police is going to be here!

868
01:08:24,248 --> 01:08:26,707
I am going to be arrested!
My friend!

869
01:08:28,415 --> 01:08:32,998
He does not want to be
disturbed because he slept late.

870
01:08:33,205 --> 01:08:34,915
Hey kid, get lost!

871
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:37,540
Slept late, indeed! My friend!

872
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:44,832
I can hear the sound of
the cops' batons in your snores!

873
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:46,248
Wake up soon!

874
01:08:50,248 --> 01:08:53,575
Oh no! If you still don't wake up,
I'll have to sleep forever!

875
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:56,240
Quickly, get up! Come on!

876
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,955
Why are you shouting?

877
01:08:58,165 --> 01:08:59,582
I say, come out!

878
01:09:02,415 --> 01:09:05,205
What is it?
You woke me from a deep slumber!

879
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:07,748
I was having such sweet dreams!

880
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:10,415
I can see dreams of death,
while I'm awake!

881
01:09:10,707 --> 01:09:13,033
What's wrong?
- You ask, what's wrong?

882
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:16,205
Chikoo's aunt was here!
She has gone to fetch the police.

883
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:19,205
She wants to take him with her!
- Let her!

884
01:09:19,707 --> 01:09:21,742
Mom will thrash me, then!

885
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:23,955
And if I don't, then the
police here will thrash me!

886
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:27,707
That's very bad!

887
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:32,582
I believe, the jails here
have frogs and cockroaches.

888
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,955
Cockroaches? Think of a solution.

889
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,998
I have nobody else,
but you in Japan!

890
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,123
Okay, tell me something.

891
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:42,955
How did the girl look?

892
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:46,330
Look? I couldn't see her properly.

893
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:48,707
But yes, she had lovely eyes!

894
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:50,617
And she appeared lovelier,
when angry!

895
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:51,915
Then, it's no problem.

896
01:09:52,498 --> 01:09:55,123
You will get your boy
and the girl, as well!

897
01:09:55,248 --> 01:09:58,582
Meaning?
- Start wooing the girl.

898
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:00,373
Woo that tigress?

899
01:10:01,205 --> 01:10:02,373
Tigress?

900
01:10:02,582 --> 01:10:06,748
When you fall in love with
a tigress, even she becomes a doe!

901
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,623
Then, you make her a doe!
- Wow!

902
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:14,415
She's taking away your nephew,
so why should I fall in love?

903
01:10:14,873 --> 01:10:18,115
No problem.
I'll ask for her address.

904
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:20,290
And fix an appointment.

905
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,330
You take some gift and reach there.

906
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:25,415
I have never been in love.

907
01:10:25,998 --> 01:10:29,955
I'd be highly obliged, if you
give some advice from your book.

908
01:10:30,205 --> 01:10:35,998
Well, sympathy is
very important in love.

909
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,080
Wow, well said!

910
01:10:38,248 --> 01:10:42,165
I wish, you had offered sympathies

911
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:45,623
for her older
sister's death earlier.

912
01:10:45,998 --> 01:10:48,373
Then, things would have worked
out in the very first meeting.

913
01:11:11,665 --> 01:11:13,373
My sincerest condolences
on your sister's death.

914
01:11:14,038 --> 01:11:18,457
Even I am very sorry. Your
older brother was a very nice man.

915
01:11:18,623 --> 01:11:20,790
He taught me Hindi.

916
01:11:21,248 --> 01:11:23,540
God bless him. God bless him.

917
01:11:25,623 --> 01:11:27,498
I wonder,
why I could not sleep last night.

918
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:32,373
I was quite irritable. So, I was
rude to you. I'm terribly sorry.

919
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,290
I have a terrible temper,
but a heart of gold.

920
01:11:36,748 --> 01:11:38,998
I forgive you.

921
01:11:39,457 --> 01:11:40,457
Thank you!

922
01:11:40,915 --> 01:11:43,955
I have brought these
flowers for you.

923
01:11:51,138 --> 01:11:54,582
Thank you. Thanks.
- Oh? Thanks?

924
01:11:54,998 --> 01:11:57,790
This is too much trouble!
- It was no trouble.

925
01:11:58,038 --> 01:12:00,415
How will I repay
you for this favour?

926
01:12:00,707 --> 01:12:02,915
I will be very indebted to you

927
01:12:03,205 --> 01:12:04,373
if you don't go
to the police station.

928
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,290
What nonsense is that?

929
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:10,373
A nice man like you should
be imprisoned in the heart.

930
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:17,457
'Goodness gracious!
Her gait is so devastating.'

931
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:21,665
'Like waves of the river
Ganga flouncing away.'

932
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:23,748
'Her looks could kill.'

933
01:12:24,415 --> 01:12:25,582
'The need of the hour.'

934
01:12:26,165 --> 01:12:29,330
'Her penetrating
gaze is so devastating.'

935
01:12:29,623 --> 01:12:32,998
'There's devastation all around.'

936
01:12:33,123 --> 01:12:34,748
'I feel like watching
her all the time.'

937
01:12:43,748 --> 01:12:44,998
I ought to go now.

938
01:12:46,582 --> 01:12:47,582
So soon?

939
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:52,290
They say,
aged wine should be sipped slowly.

940
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:56,248
I fear you may exceed your limits.

941
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,080
When will we meet, again?

942
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:03,038
Tomorrow. Goodbye.

943
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,707
'Goodbye.'

944
01:13:07,582 --> 01:13:08,582
Bye-bye.

945
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:22,623
"Goodbye."

946
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:26,700
"I will keep my promise. Goodbye."

947
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:30,623
"Cheerfully and gleefully."

948
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:32,825
"I will come again tomorrow."

949
01:13:32,915 --> 01:13:34,783
"Goodbye."

950
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:38,540
"Goodbye."

951
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:42,790
"I will keep my promise. Goodbye."

952
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:46,790
"Cheerfully and gleefully."

953
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,865
"I will come again tomorrow."

954
01:13:48,955 --> 01:13:50,825
"Goodbye."

955
01:13:50,915 --> 01:13:54,123
"Goodbye."

956
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:56,248
"Goodbye."

957
01:14:12,955 --> 01:14:16,948
"Leave my hand."

958
01:14:17,038 --> 01:14:20,955
"Don't block my path."

959
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,990
"Leave my hand."

960
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,873
"Don't block my path."

961
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:32,908
"Don't be so restless."

962
01:14:32,998 --> 01:14:36,948
"Take your eyes off me."

963
01:14:37,038 --> 01:14:40,998
"Goodbye."

964
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:44,998
"I will keep my promise. Goodbye."

965
01:14:45,123 --> 01:14:48,948
"Cheerfully and gleefully."

966
01:14:49,038 --> 01:14:50,990
"I will come again tomorrow."

967
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,908
"Goodbye."

968
01:14:52,998 --> 01:14:56,330
"Goodbye."

969
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:58,707
"Goodbye."

970
01:15:14,955 --> 01:15:18,865
"In the romantic atmosphere."

971
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:22,832
"In the enchanting surroundings."

972
01:15:22,955 --> 01:15:26,825
"In the romantic atmosphere."

973
01:15:26,915 --> 01:15:30,457
"In the enchanting surroundings."

974
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:34,665
"I won't be able to forget you."

975
01:15:34,873 --> 01:15:38,783
"We will meet in
the beautiful milieu."

976
01:15:38,873 --> 01:15:42,832
"Goodbye. Goodbye."

977
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,707
"I will keep my promise. Goodbye."

978
01:15:46,955 --> 01:15:50,582
"Cheerfully and gleefully."

979
01:15:50,915 --> 01:15:52,865
"I will come again tomorrow."

980
01:15:52,955 --> 01:15:54,748
"Goodbye."

981
01:15:54,873 --> 01:15:58,330
"Goodbye."

982
01:15:58,498 --> 01:16:00,665
"Goodbye."

983
01:16:16,832 --> 01:16:20,748
"We will meet every day."

984
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:24,742
"The days and the
nights will be ours."

985
01:16:24,832 --> 01:16:28,665
"We will meet every day."

986
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:32,540
"The days and the
nights will be ours."

987
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:36,665
"Then, who will restrict us?"

988
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:40,748
"You may say anything you want."

989
01:16:40,873 --> 01:16:44,825
"Goodbye. Goodbye."

990
01:16:44,915 --> 01:16:48,790
"I will keep my promise. Goodbye."

991
01:16:48,915 --> 01:16:52,790
"Cheerfully and gleefully."

992
01:16:52,915 --> 01:16:54,865
"I will come again, tomorrow."

993
01:16:54,955 --> 01:16:56,790
"Goodbye."

994
01:16:56,915 --> 01:17:00,123
"Goodbye."

995
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:03,248
"Goodbye."

996
01:17:04,373 --> 01:17:06,540
"Goodbye."

997
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:10,498
"Goodbye."

998
01:17:12,707 --> 01:17:15,540
My friend! Where are you?

999
01:17:16,205 --> 01:17:18,832
Where are you? Come out!

1000
01:17:19,623 --> 01:17:21,790
My friend!
- What's the matter?

1001
01:17:22,457 --> 01:17:25,283
You must embrace me, today!
- What happened?

1002
01:17:25,373 --> 01:17:26,832
Legendary lovers died

1003
01:17:26,955 --> 01:17:30,790
trying to find the
advice which you gave me!

1004
01:17:30,915 --> 01:17:34,330
Please keep your distance!
I don't want to hug!

1005
01:17:34,873 --> 01:17:37,415
You must embrace me, today!

1006
01:17:38,123 --> 01:17:43,200
You are such a fool! I thought,
you must have embraced her!

1007
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:47,283
May your words come true!
That day will be here soon!

1008
01:17:47,373 --> 01:17:48,415
What?

1009
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,658
Anyway, how is she?

1010
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:55,540
Sweet? Hot and spicy? Lovely?

1011
01:17:56,498 --> 01:17:58,790
When she laughs,
she is as sweet as honey!

1012
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:01,575
And when she is angry,
she looks like a green chilli.

1013
01:18:01,665 --> 01:18:03,325
And when she gets angry,
she appears like...

1014
01:18:03,415 --> 01:18:04,742
Red, hot chillies?
- Right.

1015
01:18:04,832 --> 01:18:08,865
And when she laughs a little,
it seems a rose...

1016
01:18:08,955 --> 01:18:11,832
Sweet!
- Hey! You've cut your finger.

1017
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,832
What are you doing?
You are very dirty!

1018
01:18:14,998 --> 01:18:16,290
You are very dirty!

1019
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:17,955
When you see her, you lose courage

1020
01:18:18,123 --> 01:18:20,665
but, act brave when you come to me!

1021
01:18:23,955 --> 01:18:24,915
What's wrong?

1022
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:29,205
You smell just like her!

1023
01:18:29,665 --> 01:18:32,955
A man in love sees his
beloved in every person!

1024
01:18:33,373 --> 01:18:35,908
When will you be meeting her?

1025
01:18:35,998 --> 01:18:39,373
Tomorrow.
You also come and watch us enjoy.

1026
01:18:39,623 --> 01:18:41,205
It's not in my book

1027
01:18:41,955 --> 01:18:45,373
to merely count the leaves,
when a hunter goes to hunt!

1028
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:09,080
Please, accept my
greetings filled with love.

1029
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:14,872
I'll be grateful,
if you tell me your name.

1030
01:19:15,622 --> 01:19:18,038
One does not ask
the name of a lover.

1031
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,413
Then, whose name will
I chant and live by?

1032
01:19:21,455 --> 01:19:23,538
People in love do not live,

1033
01:19:24,872 --> 01:19:27,245
they die,
chanting each other's name.

1034
01:19:29,162 --> 01:19:30,580
Every desire of mine
revolves around you.

1035
01:19:31,538 --> 01:19:33,663
Where do you live?

1036
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,997
In your house, near your heart.

1037
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:39,872
In fact, in your heart!

1038
01:19:41,538 --> 01:19:44,580
Love resides in our hearts.

1039
01:19:46,413 --> 01:19:49,038
'An ocean of beauty
steals my heart.'

1040
01:19:49,955 --> 01:19:53,497
'She kills me, and then
says she resides in my heart.'

1041
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:01,372
'I feel like kissing you.'

1042
01:20:04,622 --> 01:20:05,788
'But, no.'

1043
01:20:06,288 --> 01:20:08,872
'If you say no, I could kiss away'

1044
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:12,330
'your apprehensions,
I'd put at rest.'

1045
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:19,663
'In love, time just flies.'

1046
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:24,330
'In each other, we get lost.'

1047
01:20:40,205 --> 01:20:43,372
Were you offended?

1048
01:20:44,538 --> 01:20:46,580
I don't know, why I feel

1049
01:20:47,245 --> 01:20:49,205
as though,
I've awakened from a deep slumber.

1050
01:20:49,747 --> 01:20:51,657
Did you think of some work?

1051
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:54,122
Yes. It is very important.

1052
01:20:54,997 --> 01:20:56,288
More important than me?

1053
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,163
If you don't mind,
then I'll say yes.

1054
01:21:01,162 --> 01:21:02,997
When will we meet again?

1055
01:21:03,622 --> 01:21:06,872
Tomorrow, same time, same place.

1056
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,747
I'll wait for you.

1057
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:11,330
Goodbye.

1058
01:21:21,997 --> 01:21:22,997
Come in.

1059
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:41,245
'My dear friend, please accept
my greetings filled with love.'

1060
01:21:41,455 --> 01:21:43,330
'I had to suddenly leave for India'

1061
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:45,245
'with Chikoo by the flight at 5.'

1062
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:48,122
'I could not even thank
you for your favours.'

1063
01:21:48,705 --> 01:21:52,663
'The Japanese girl sure
looks the like one on TV.'

1064
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,747
'But, she lacks the
style of the Indian girl.'

1065
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,573
'Remember, you would say'

1066
01:21:57,663 --> 01:22:01,663
'praying at the Tokyo
shrine unites estranged love?'

1067
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:04,788
'Go there and
sincerely pray for me.'

1068
01:22:05,622 --> 01:22:09,455
'Perhaps, I'll get my beautiful
maiden and make her mine.'

1069
01:22:09,872 --> 01:22:11,205
'Yours, Ashok.'

1070
01:22:20,955 --> 01:22:21,955
Airport.

1071
01:22:41,002 --> 01:22:42,460
'Your attention, please.'

1072
01:22:42,585 --> 01:22:48,168
'Japan Airlines announces
the departure of Air Flight 007.'

1073
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:51,293
'for Hong Kong,
Bangkok and Bombay.'

1074
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:56,838
'Your attention, please.'

1075
01:22:56,928 --> 01:23:00,053
'Passengers are requested
to proceed to the aircraft.'

1076
01:23:00,303 --> 01:23:01,303
'Goodbye!'

1077
01:23:14,387 --> 01:23:15,387
Faster!

1078
01:24:28,893 --> 01:24:30,512
'Remember, you would say'

1079
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:33,928
'praying at the Tokyo
shrine unites estranged love?'

1080
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,595
'Go there and
sincerely pray for me.'

1081
01:24:37,553 --> 01:24:41,470
'Perhaps, I'll get my beautiful
maiden and make her mine.'

1082
01:25:16,137 --> 01:25:24,783
"Oh, my beautiful
maiden, oh, my love."

1083
01:25:24,982 --> 01:25:32,983
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1084
01:25:33,275 --> 01:25:41,317
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1085
01:25:41,525 --> 01:25:49,650
"Oh, my beautiful
maiden, oh my love."

1086
01:25:49,817 --> 01:25:57,817
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1087
01:26:22,858 --> 01:26:28,900
"When fond memories
come back to me"

1088
01:26:29,025 --> 01:26:34,525
"every path lights up."

1089
01:26:34,942 --> 01:26:40,650
"Wherever my shadow goes"

1090
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:46,442
"your image walks along."

1091
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:55,567
"Oh, my beautiful
maiden, oh, my love."

1092
01:26:55,775 --> 01:27:03,733
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1093
01:27:04,157 --> 01:27:12,025
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1094
01:27:28,817 --> 01:27:34,692
"You are in the
deserts and the gardens."

1095
01:27:35,025 --> 01:27:40,567
"You are in the
valleys and in the woods."

1096
01:27:40,942 --> 01:27:46,567
"I see you everywhere."

1097
01:27:46,982 --> 01:27:52,442
"You can't hide away from me."

1098
01:27:52,982 --> 01:28:01,310
"Oh, my beautiful
maiden, oh, my love."

1099
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:09,275
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1100
01:28:09,692 --> 01:28:17,650
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1101
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:48,108
"You are the one
my heart longs for."

1102
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,942
"You are my desire."

1103
01:28:54,317 --> 01:28:59,692
"I don't know anyone else."

1104
01:29:00,318 --> 01:29:05,650
"You are the one my love honours."

1105
01:29:06,233 --> 01:29:14,525
"Oh, my beautiful
maiden, oh, my love."

1106
01:29:14,692 --> 01:29:22,892
"You are with me,
There is no one else."

1107
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:30,858
"You are with me,
there is no one else."

1108
01:29:35,025 --> 01:29:37,483
Were you hiding since
so long to harass me?

1109
01:29:38,567 --> 01:29:41,150
You were the one who was
harassing me all along, not me.

1110
01:29:42,192 --> 01:29:43,692
I harassed you just once,

1111
01:29:44,317 --> 01:29:45,400
and you got offended?

1112
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:53,192
Friend, you look very lovely.

1113
01:29:53,775 --> 01:29:55,358
You must embrace me, today!

1114
01:30:03,608 --> 01:30:05,858
I've found the treasure!

1115
01:30:07,442 --> 01:30:09,775
I have found the girl who
carries a reward on her head!

1116
01:30:10,983 --> 01:30:12,817
Let me go. I said, let go of me!

1117
01:30:12,942 --> 01:30:15,442
Are you blind? Can't you see
the bank of India before you?

1118
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:18,525
So what? We'll share!
- Leave me!

1119
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:21,483
Ashok!
- Mahesh!

1120
01:30:22,358 --> 01:30:23,400
Asha,

1121
01:30:23,942 --> 01:30:25,893
he's Mahesh, my
childhood friend. - Hi!

1122
01:30:25,983 --> 01:30:28,775
Hi! - He was the one I was tracing
at Geisha House the other day.

1123
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,727
Do you like your sister-in-law?

1124
01:30:30,817 --> 01:30:32,233
Yes.

1125
01:30:32,567 --> 01:30:35,442
Sister-in-law? That means,
I've lost the treasure!

1126
01:30:35,692 --> 01:30:37,275
Excuse me! Come here.

1127
01:30:39,983 --> 01:30:44,733
If she's my sister-in-law,
then is Sarita your aunt?

1128
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:47,358
I never planned to marry Sarita!

1129
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,400
You'll die and have
me killed, also!

1130
01:30:50,525 --> 01:30:53,650
Your mother sent me to
Japan to protect you.

1131
01:30:53,775 --> 01:30:58,352
If she sees her,
your mother will butcher me!

1132
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:00,275
What nonsense? Come here.

1133
01:31:01,065 --> 01:31:04,567
The day mother casts
her eyes on this beauty

1134
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:06,983
she will start to chant
her daughter-in-law's name!

1135
01:31:09,025 --> 01:31:12,065
You got your love
and your nephew too!

1136
01:31:13,108 --> 01:31:15,525
Now think of an idea
whereby I'll get my Sheela!

1137
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:19,065
I wonder what that
dark Ohatterjee has!

1138
01:31:20,817 --> 01:31:23,400
Her father is
getting her married to him!

1139
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,442
And he pursues me with a revolver!

1140
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,025
The poor girl keeps
crying all day long.

1141
01:31:32,442 --> 01:31:34,525
And has a long face.

1142
01:31:39,065 --> 01:31:42,275
Come in, Chatterjee.
I'll call Sheela.

1143
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,108
Hey, Chhoti!

1144
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,400
Act well, while I
go and fetch a doctor.

1145
01:31:49,817 --> 01:31:51,775
Come in, my son Chatterjee. Come.

1146
01:31:54,817 --> 01:31:57,150
This is the compact
house of your father-in-law.

1147
01:31:57,982 --> 01:31:59,733
Sheela!

1148
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:03,150
I have raised my
daughter with great care.

1149
01:32:03,275 --> 01:32:07,567
You know how coy Indian girls are.

1150
01:32:07,817 --> 01:32:10,935
She doesn't talk, at all.
As though she is mute.

1151
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,065
I'll call her right away. Sheela!

1152
01:32:15,192 --> 01:32:18,227
She's very shy. Please sit here,
while I go and fetch her.

1153
01:32:18,317 --> 01:32:19,892
Sit.

1154
01:32:19,982 --> 01:32:21,192
Sit.

1155
01:32:29,733 --> 01:32:34,525
Sheela, Chatterjee is here,
and you have still not changed?

1156
01:32:34,775 --> 01:32:37,025
Do you plan to have me humiliated?

1157
01:32:41,858 --> 01:32:44,310
Have you put a lot of
tobacco in your betel leaf?

1158
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,483
Red betel leaf!

1159
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:51,358
Which language are you speaking?

1160
01:32:57,192 --> 01:33:00,150
Dear God, there have been
blind people born in my family!

1161
01:33:02,108 --> 01:33:03,817
But, they were never mute!

1162
01:33:04,065 --> 01:33:08,982
When I eventually found a girl,
she turned out to be mute!

1163
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,900
Put your tongue out or I
swear, I'll cut your nose!

1164
01:33:16,275 --> 01:33:19,900
You told me the girl was mute.

1165
01:33:20,025 --> 01:33:22,352
But, not her father, too!

1166
01:33:22,442 --> 01:33:25,192
Put your tongue out, some more.

1167
01:33:26,608 --> 01:33:31,025
He has a black tongue
and a black heart, as well!

1168
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:34,352
He's your future wife's brother!

1169
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,192
Future wife's brother!

1170
01:33:36,317 --> 01:33:37,935
I can understand
Bengali, but not speak it.

1171
01:33:38,025 --> 01:33:40,775
Who are you?
- Here is the silly man!

1172
01:33:41,065 --> 01:33:44,108
You remember your servant,
but don't remember me?

1173
01:33:44,233 --> 01:33:46,567
I'm Aziz Mehmood, an Arab doctor.

1174
01:33:46,733 --> 01:33:50,560
I was a horse trainer in India,
but I treat humans here.

1175
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,358
Oh! I'm very sorry.
- You apologise in English?

1176
01:33:53,608 --> 01:33:55,477
Please come in. Hurry up.
- My bag, please.

1177
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:57,442
Sure!

1178
01:33:57,567 --> 01:33:59,317
What's happening?

1179
01:33:59,442 --> 01:34:01,602
Ma'am is ill.

1180
01:34:01,692 --> 01:34:03,692
I have something to tell you.

1181
01:34:03,817 --> 01:34:08,650
Your future wife has become mute,
due to the grief of her lover.

1182
01:34:08,858 --> 01:34:11,733
Lady, put your tongue out.

1183
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:17,525
That's bad! Real bad!

1184
01:34:17,942 --> 01:34:20,852
Brother, your daughter is mute.

1185
01:34:20,942 --> 01:34:23,233
Why?
- Because, she cannot speak.

1186
01:34:23,358 --> 01:34:24,775
Why can't she speak?

1187
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,352
Because she is mute, you chef!

1188
01:34:27,442 --> 01:34:32,150
Chef. I'm no chef. I'm the
unfortunate father of the girl.

1189
01:34:38,608 --> 01:34:42,442
Listen carefully, the unfortunate
father of this fortunate girl.

1190
01:34:42,608 --> 01:34:46,858
A woman's heart is
divided into two parts.

1191
01:34:47,983 --> 01:34:50,775
You separated her lover from her.

1192
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:55,442
So, one part of her heart
is stuck in her throat.

1193
01:34:55,567 --> 01:34:58,567
Stuck? So, what's the remedy?

1194
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:00,975
There is a remedy, and
you don't have to pay a penny.

1195
01:35:01,065 --> 01:35:02,608
No expense?
- No!

1196
01:35:02,733 --> 01:35:05,692
Take her beloved's hand in yours.

1197
01:35:06,483 --> 01:35:08,525
Tighter.
- Yes.

1198
01:35:08,817 --> 01:35:13,775
Slowly, go near your daughter.

1199
01:35:14,192 --> 01:35:19,650
Then place her hand in her
beloved's hand, forever.

1200
01:35:19,942 --> 01:35:21,858
Suppose I don't, then?
- Then...

1201
01:35:22,358 --> 01:35:24,775
she will remain mute all her life!

1202
01:35:24,942 --> 01:35:27,893
And you, her father,
will also become mute!

1203
01:35:27,983 --> 01:35:30,935
And so will her husband!

1204
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:34,150
Even the children may be mute.
- Really?

1205
01:35:35,172 --> 01:35:37,498
And the neighbours go mute too!
- Good Lord!

1206
01:35:37,588 --> 01:35:39,325
All of Japan may become mute!
- Oh no!

1207
01:35:39,415 --> 01:35:42,998
And on reaching India, all
Indians may become mute!

1208
01:35:43,088 --> 01:35:46,120
Mr Chatterjee, one never
knows with this ailment.

1209
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,110
It's so strange!

1210
01:35:48,235 --> 01:35:50,318
If the number of mute people soars

1211
01:35:50,485 --> 01:35:52,020
we'll have to
craft a nation for them!

1212
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:54,110
Good Lord!
- Mr Chatterjee!

1213
01:35:54,235 --> 01:35:55,735
What's it?
- Have a sweet.

1214
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,485
Throw it in the fire!

1215
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:59,987
Should I burn it?

1216
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:06,820
'Rasgulla'.

1217
01:36:06,945 --> 01:36:09,653
Thank you.
- This cake?

1218
01:36:10,443 --> 01:36:13,778
Who says that this is a cake?

1219
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:18,360
This is my broken heart.

1220
01:36:18,695 --> 01:36:20,360
It's my broken heart.

1221
01:36:21,735 --> 01:36:23,778
There are two dogs on it.

1222
01:36:24,318 --> 01:36:26,653
One and two.

1223
01:36:28,443 --> 01:36:29,528
'Mohan,'

1224
01:36:30,653 --> 01:36:32,152
'my heart I gave away...'

1225
01:36:32,443 --> 01:36:34,360
'Pain is all I take with me.'

1226
01:36:35,110 --> 01:36:37,653
Mr Mohan.
- Yes?

1227
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:41,395
Cut this cake into tiny pieces

1228
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:44,978
and feed it to the groom's
people on Sheela's wedding.

1229
01:36:45,068 --> 01:36:48,610
Anything else?
- No.

1230
01:36:48,735 --> 01:36:51,443
This is my final will, Mr Mohan.

1231
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:52,985
My last will!

1232
01:36:53,235 --> 01:36:55,020
The last will!

1233
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:57,860
Mahesh, dear boy!

1234
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:03,937
If I have been insolent with you

1235
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,937
then, please forgive me.

1236
01:37:06,027 --> 01:37:09,693
Of course, at 4:20 pm today...
- What will happen?

1237
01:37:09,818 --> 01:37:12,528
My dead body will
be found near Tokyo Tower.

1238
01:37:12,653 --> 01:37:14,360
Please, don't say that!

1239
01:37:14,485 --> 01:37:18,903
Bye, the one who gave me
disappointment!

1240
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,653
Goodbye.

1241
01:37:20,778 --> 01:37:27,027
Mahesh dear, I will be getting
Sheela married to you. - Uncle!

1242
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:30,152
She has become mute for your love!

1243
01:37:30,277 --> 01:37:32,110
When she wasn't mute

1244
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,318
you were going to get her
married to that dark buffalo!

1245
01:37:35,653 --> 01:37:39,068
Now that she's mute, you've
thought of me!

1246
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:42,903
To each, his own destiny!

1247
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:47,903
She's yours and will
remain so, forever and ever.

1248
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:50,110
Is that so?
- Yes.

1249
01:37:51,025 --> 01:37:53,068
If my love is strong
and true enough

1250
01:37:53,318 --> 01:37:55,360
I'll make her talk, right now!

1251
01:37:55,568 --> 01:38:00,985
She will scream
aloud in a minute or two!

1252
01:38:01,235 --> 01:38:02,860
Come inside with me.

1253
01:38:05,693 --> 01:38:10,735
"Tell me Radha, will the
river Ganga of my heart"

1254
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:15,735
"and Jamuna of your heart
meet or not?"

1255
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:20,818
"Tell me Radha, will the
river Ganga of my heart"

1256
01:38:20,945 --> 01:38:25,443
"and Jamuna of your heart
meet or not?"

1257
01:38:25,568 --> 01:38:30,653
"Tell me Radha, if they
will meet or not?"

1258
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:33,068
Tell, dear.

1259
01:38:33,402 --> 01:38:34,903
Speak up, dear.

1260
01:38:53,985 --> 01:39:02,277
"So many eras are past
trying to make you understand."

1261
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:13,145
"Is there anyone in this
world who has so much patience?"

1262
01:39:13,235 --> 01:39:18,485
"Will the increasing burden of
my heart decrease or not?"

1263
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:23,235
"Tell me Radha if we
will meet or not?"

1264
01:39:28,443 --> 01:39:29,818
Yes!

1265
01:39:29,945 --> 01:39:33,402
It's done.
- I'd heard that love is blind.

1266
01:39:33,693 --> 01:39:36,193
But today, I have seen
that love is mute too!

1267
01:40:01,068 --> 01:40:05,485
Even I can become an Arab doctor!

1268
01:40:07,402 --> 01:40:10,778
How does it look? Good?

1269
01:40:11,487 --> 01:40:13,610
This robe was lying there.

1270
01:40:13,985 --> 01:40:15,778
Lying there?
- Yes.

1271
01:40:15,903 --> 01:40:20,903
I told you that Chatterjee will
have to be reborn to marry you!

1272
01:40:21,193 --> 01:40:26,610
The woman of my heart and
that dark buffalo are poles apart!

1273
01:40:27,318 --> 01:40:28,568
Mahesh!

1274
01:40:28,693 --> 01:40:30,318
Darling, where did
that sound come from?

1275
01:40:30,485 --> 01:40:36,735
"Answer me, Sheela,
will we ever be one?"

1276
01:40:36,985 --> 01:40:38,563
No way!

1277
01:40:38,653 --> 01:40:40,610
Never! Never!

1278
01:40:40,735 --> 01:40:42,735
Never! Never!

1279
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:44,443
Never! Never!

1280
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:48,783
When it comes to Ashok, I think...

1281
01:40:48,873 --> 01:40:52,367
Mr Rai, I've told you

1282
01:40:52,457 --> 01:40:56,290
think and answer me after one hour.

1283
01:40:56,415 --> 01:40:58,248
10 seconds left.

1284
01:41:11,998 --> 01:41:13,040
Mr Rai.

1285
01:41:14,248 --> 01:41:15,748
Tell me your plan.

1286
01:41:18,123 --> 01:41:20,123
I think, you should send a telegram

1287
01:41:20,248 --> 01:41:22,998
to the Japanese
government and call them.

1288
01:41:23,123 --> 01:41:25,040
What do you think?

1289
01:41:25,498 --> 01:41:28,207
I think, it's a rotten idea!

1290
01:41:28,707 --> 01:41:34,415
I think, we should go to
Japan and find out how he is.

1291
01:41:39,248 --> 01:41:43,165
"Japan..."

1292
01:41:45,707 --> 01:41:49,498
"Love in Tokyo."

1293
01:41:49,957 --> 01:41:53,748
"Japan..."

1294
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:57,873
"Love in Tokyo."

1295
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:13,540
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1296
01:42:13,665 --> 01:42:17,707
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1297
01:42:17,957 --> 01:42:21,957
"Made me go out of control."

1298
01:42:22,082 --> 01:42:26,082
"Made me go out of control."

1299
01:42:26,373 --> 01:42:30,663
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1300
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:34,748
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1301
01:42:34,915 --> 01:42:39,040
"Made me go out of control."

1302
01:42:39,165 --> 01:42:43,207
"Made me go out of control."

1303
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:47,415
"Japan..."

1304
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:51,707
"Love in Tokyo."

1305
01:43:13,123 --> 01:43:17,290
"A beautiful city this is."

1306
01:43:17,415 --> 01:43:21,248
"Whose style is romantic."

1307
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:25,450
"It gives the message of love."

1308
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:29,082
"Makes everyone go crazy."

1309
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:33,457
"A beautiful city this is."

1310
01:43:33,915 --> 01:43:37,748
"Whose style is romantic."

1311
01:43:37,998 --> 01:43:41,957
"It gives the message of love."

1312
01:43:42,207 --> 01:43:45,665
"Makes everyone go crazy."

1313
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:50,248
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1314
01:43:50,373 --> 01:43:54,332
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1315
01:43:54,457 --> 01:43:58,457
"Made me go out of control."

1316
01:43:58,623 --> 01:44:02,658
"Made me go out of control."

1317
01:44:02,748 --> 01:44:06,373
"Japan..."

1318
01:44:06,748 --> 01:44:10,915
"Love in Tokyo."

1319
01:44:38,373 --> 01:44:42,415
"Look at these attractive paths."

1320
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:46,498
"They beckon to us."

1321
01:44:46,665 --> 01:44:50,540
"The atmosphere is so colourful."

1322
01:44:50,748 --> 01:44:54,623
"Japanese maidens smile."

1323
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:58,623
"Look at these attractive paths."

1324
01:44:58,873 --> 01:45:02,623
"They beckon to us."

1325
01:45:02,957 --> 01:45:06,957
"The atmosphere is so colourful."

1326
01:45:07,082 --> 01:45:10,540
"Japanese maidens smile."

1327
01:45:10,873 --> 01:45:14,915
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1328
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,957
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1329
01:45:19,248 --> 01:45:23,123
"Made me go out of control."

1330
01:45:23,248 --> 01:45:27,248
"Made me go out of control."

1331
01:45:27,415 --> 01:45:31,182
"Japan..."

1332
01:45:31,380 --> 01:45:34,428
"Love in Tokyo."

1333
01:45:56,445 --> 01:46:00,278
"Beauties dance everywhere."

1334
01:46:00,695 --> 01:46:04,445
"Sing the saga of love."

1335
01:46:04,778 --> 01:46:08,487
"There comes the Queen of cabaret."

1336
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:12,445
"Whose style is lively."

1337
01:46:12,945 --> 01:46:16,528
"Beauties dance everywhere."

1338
01:46:16,987 --> 01:46:20,612
"Sing the saga of love."

1339
01:46:21,112 --> 01:46:24,738
"There comes the Queen of cabaret."

1340
01:46:25,195 --> 01:46:28,612
"Whose style is lively."

1341
01:46:28,903 --> 01:46:33,070
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1342
01:46:33,195 --> 01:46:37,125
"A beautiful maiden of
Japan stole my heart."

1343
01:46:37,215 --> 01:46:41,028
"Made me go out of control."

1344
01:46:41,295 --> 01:46:45,318
"Made me go out of control."

1345
01:46:45,408 --> 01:46:49,112
"Japan..."

1346
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:53,028
"Love in Tokyo."

1347
01:46:53,653 --> 01:46:56,612
"Japan..."

1348
01:47:00,147 --> 01:47:04,063
I told you a hundred
times, I don't want to eat!

1349
01:47:09,772 --> 01:47:11,223
Once upon a time, beautiful maidens

1350
01:47:11,313 --> 01:47:12,730
would shoot Cupid's arrows.

1351
01:47:12,938 --> 01:47:14,103
And now, they throw soup!

1352
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:16,355
Yet, shameless people
don't get the message!

1353
01:47:16,855 --> 01:47:17,772
What can I do?

1354
01:47:18,105 --> 01:47:19,813
I'm in love with you.

1355
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:24,438
I have never seen a more
shameless man than you!

1356
01:47:25,355 --> 01:47:29,138
I left shame behind the
day I fell in love with you.

1357
01:47:29,228 --> 01:47:30,772
With me or my money?

1358
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:32,015
How does it matter?

1359
01:47:32,105 --> 01:47:36,395
It's one and the same thing.

1360
01:47:36,563 --> 01:47:39,270
Anyway, why not eat something?

1361
01:47:39,605 --> 01:47:41,438
Come, I'll feed you.

1362
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:43,063
Get out.

1363
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:44,723
Throw me out a hundred times.

1364
01:47:44,813 --> 01:47:48,192
But, where else would I go?

1365
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,145
I hate you!

1366
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,145
Men in love like me
term this hatred as love!

1367
01:47:54,355 --> 01:47:55,813
Will you leave or not?

1368
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:57,855
As you say.

1369
01:48:00,313 --> 01:48:03,395
But, do remember that I
will be at your service.

1370
01:48:14,022 --> 01:48:18,022
Uncle, I'm going out. I
have locked Asha in the room.

1371
01:48:18,438 --> 01:48:19,938
Take good care of her.

1372
01:48:20,063 --> 01:48:23,270
Take more care of the
key than the clothes.

1373
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,730
It's the room in
which Sheela is locked.

1374
01:48:27,022 --> 01:48:28,647
I'll have a steam bath and come.

1375
01:48:28,772 --> 01:48:30,897
Sir, even I'll come.
- Yes.

1376
01:48:31,063 --> 01:48:32,813
Wait here!

1377
01:48:35,772 --> 01:48:37,855
His ancestors used to
bathe in drain water.

1378
01:48:38,105 --> 01:48:40,395
And this old man
will have a steam bath!

1379
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,438
Two ice creams, please.

1380
01:48:46,647 --> 01:48:48,270
Do people who have
a steam bath here

1381
01:48:48,395 --> 01:48:50,098
need to be given an ice-cream?

1382
01:48:50,188 --> 01:48:52,022
It must be a Japanese custom, sir.

1383
01:48:52,438 --> 01:48:54,188
In olden days, all
the legendary lovers

1384
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:56,480
would meet in the jungles.

1385
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:00,063
In secluded places,

1386
01:49:00,395 --> 01:49:01,932
in cemeteries.

1387
01:49:02,022 --> 01:49:05,063
But in today's times, we
can't even come close!

1388
01:49:06,063 --> 01:49:08,105
God bless these Japanese

1389
01:49:08,395 --> 01:49:13,772
who made this steamy
room for lovers like us!

1390
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,598
And we're taking a
steam bath together, today.

1391
01:49:16,688 --> 01:49:19,098
What fun it will be,
if dad arrives here!

1392
01:49:19,188 --> 01:49:23,855
Darn! Your filthy father does
not bathe for 6 months, together!

1393
01:49:24,313 --> 01:49:27,855
And you say, he
would come here? No way!

1394
01:49:28,772 --> 01:49:30,647
You're unnecessarily scared.

1395
01:49:31,395 --> 01:49:32,980
Thank you, boy.

1396
01:49:37,188 --> 01:49:38,688
Dad!

1397
01:49:41,393 --> 01:49:42,848
Dad... Dad...

1398
01:49:42,938 --> 01:49:44,730
Dad... Dad...

1399
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:47,313
Dad... Dad...

1400
01:49:50,897 --> 01:49:52,390
I'll kill you!

1401
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:54,055
I came here to hide.

1402
01:49:54,145 --> 01:49:55,730
I am telling you.

1403
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:58,640
Are you an Indian?
- Dad is coming here!

1404
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:02,520
And what's this? It's
sticking to my feet!

1405
01:50:02,647 --> 01:50:05,723
Why am I airborne? I'm flying!

1406
01:50:05,813 --> 01:50:07,395
What's happening?

1407
01:50:07,563 --> 01:50:09,897
Hey, what's happening?
Why am I flying?

1408
01:50:10,022 --> 01:50:12,098
Why am I flying?

1409
01:50:12,188 --> 01:50:16,145
What's happening? Dad!

1410
01:50:16,395 --> 01:50:19,520
Dad!

1411
01:50:20,772 --> 01:50:23,430
I'm going to kill him.

1412
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:28,395
You can't move.
This is my invention.

1413
01:50:28,688 --> 01:50:31,563
I can fly!

1414
01:50:33,813 --> 01:50:37,145
This is good! You'll die
under a Japanese car, now!

1415
01:50:37,772 --> 01:50:39,313
No!

1416
01:50:40,605 --> 01:50:42,105
No!

1417
01:50:49,145 --> 01:50:51,772
What a flight!

1418
01:50:59,105 --> 01:51:00,980
Bye!

1419
01:51:32,188 --> 01:51:33,855
Oh God!

1420
01:51:38,145 --> 01:51:40,055
I'm on fire!

1421
01:51:40,145 --> 01:51:41,480
I'm on fire!

1422
01:51:44,897 --> 01:51:46,520
Coca Cola!

1423
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:34,897
Here, take your daughter.

1424
01:52:38,145 --> 01:52:39,688
Flubber shoes!

1425
01:52:42,980 --> 01:52:44,313
Uncle Mahesh.

1426
01:52:44,897 --> 01:52:45,723
Mahesh!

1427
01:52:45,813 --> 01:52:47,973
Call me Superman, not Mahesh.
I've been flying.

1428
01:52:48,063 --> 01:52:49,145
Why are you dressed like a madman?

1429
01:52:49,313 --> 01:52:52,022
Because, that madman is after me!

1430
01:52:52,688 --> 01:52:55,145
But, why do you look so glum?
Where is sister-in-law?

1431
01:52:55,313 --> 01:52:56,807
I don't know where she is.

1432
01:52:56,897 --> 01:53:00,688
I wanted the reward, so I
remember her address very well.

1433
01:53:00,855 --> 01:53:01,813
You do?
- Yes.

1434
01:53:01,938 --> 01:53:04,188
Honolulu, Ginza,
Abdullamani Street, Tokyo, Japan.

1435
01:53:04,395 --> 01:53:05,772
Let's go.

1436
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:44,348
Where is my child? Where
is the apple of my eye?

1437
01:53:44,438 --> 01:53:46,730
Where is my darling son?

1438
01:53:46,855 --> 01:53:48,855
Who are you? And why
have you barged inside?

1439
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:53,270
We don't talk to servants.
We want to talk to your boss.

1440
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,598
I am the master of this
house. What do you want?

1441
01:53:55,688 --> 01:53:58,813
You are? Police, arrest him.

1442
01:53:58,938 --> 01:54:01,223
He has kidnapped my child.
- What?

1443
01:54:01,313 --> 01:54:04,980
Wife, Anarkali, call out
in your melodious voice.

1444
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,145
Please call Gulfam Kali.

1445
01:54:08,355 --> 01:54:10,647
One... Two...

1446
01:54:11,145 --> 01:54:13,438
Three... Four...

1447
01:54:13,688 --> 01:54:19,938
"Come, beloved child."

1448
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:26,145
"Your mother
screams to beckon you."

1449
01:54:26,313 --> 01:54:32,265
Mom, release me from this
evil man's clutches, rescue me!

1450
01:54:32,355 --> 01:54:34,098
Please save my life!

1451
01:54:34,188 --> 01:54:35,980
Please save my life!

1452
01:54:36,188 --> 01:54:37,265
He spoke!
- He spoke!

1453
01:54:37,355 --> 01:54:39,055
He spoke!
- My Gulfam spoke!

1454
01:54:39,145 --> 01:54:41,813
He spoke!
- But, my niece is in that room.

1455
01:54:42,145 --> 01:54:43,228
And she is not even married.

1456
01:54:43,355 --> 01:54:45,563
So, is that her child
speaking before the marriage?

1457
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:49,355
Take this. Go
upstairs and fetch Gulfam.

1458
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:50,598
Okay.

1459
01:54:50,688 --> 01:54:53,813
Why are you looking upstairs?

1460
01:54:53,980 --> 01:54:56,228
My wife is wearing a veil.

1461
01:54:56,563 --> 01:54:58,438
You looked up again!
I'll blind you!

1462
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,228
Quiet! Quiet!

1463
01:55:03,228 --> 01:55:05,647
We have found our son Gulfam!

1464
01:55:05,772 --> 01:55:09,688
Come here.

1465
01:55:10,813 --> 01:55:12,355
Where is my son?

1466
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,223
Where is my son?

1467
01:55:14,313 --> 01:55:16,938
Where is he? My darling son!
- Help!

1468
01:55:17,063 --> 01:55:18,938
My darling son!

1469
01:55:19,063 --> 01:55:20,772
These butchers have been so wicked!

1470
01:55:20,897 --> 01:55:23,105
Dear, just help me
to untie him. Dear boy.

1471
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:25,313
I hope, you were not
in deep trouble?

1472
01:55:25,438 --> 01:55:27,105
Come on.
- Strange.

1473
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:29,270
I have never seen the child before!

1474
01:55:29,772 --> 01:55:32,015
Didn't your departed father

1475
01:55:32,105 --> 01:55:33,980
not have any children?
- What?

1476
01:55:34,730 --> 01:55:39,223
This lady here gave me a chocolate.

1477
01:55:39,313 --> 01:55:43,395
And this man brought
me here in his car.

1478
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,313
That's untrue!
- A lie!

1479
01:55:45,438 --> 01:55:46,855
Quiet, you fool!

1480
01:55:47,022 --> 01:55:49,055
Let the matter be decided
at the police station.

1481
01:55:49,145 --> 01:55:50,557
Let's go! I'm not afraid!

1482
01:55:50,647 --> 01:55:52,355
Even I'm not afraid of the police.

1483
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,188
After all, he is my son!

1484
01:55:54,313 --> 01:55:56,145
So, let's go!

1485
01:55:56,395 --> 01:55:57,730
Let's go!
- Let's go!

1486
01:55:57,855 --> 01:55:59,688
Wife, congratulations
on finding your son!

1487
01:55:59,938 --> 01:56:00,938
We found him!

1488
01:56:01,063 --> 01:56:02,563
You too, my love.

1489
01:56:05,772 --> 01:56:09,605
Uncle, I'm going to the police
station. Bring the solicitor.

1490
01:56:09,730 --> 01:56:11,480
Okay.

1491
01:56:17,897 --> 01:56:19,765
Oh, no!

1492
01:56:19,855 --> 01:56:22,022
Take your seat.
- Thank you!

1493
01:56:23,063 --> 01:56:24,647
Now, what?

1494
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:26,313
The burqa.

1495
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:28,557
Mr Anderson, give me that.

1496
01:56:28,647 --> 01:56:29,973
Let Ms Asha come.

1497
01:56:30,063 --> 01:56:32,313
Alright, alright, I'll bring her.

1498
01:56:34,438 --> 01:56:37,730
O' magnificent man!
The one who's so royal!

1499
01:56:37,855 --> 01:56:41,270
Please look this way.

1500
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,938
Are you the renowned pilot, Pran?

1501
01:56:44,063 --> 01:56:46,647
Yes, I am. But, who are you?

1502
01:56:46,772 --> 01:56:48,938
A distant uncle of yours.

1503
01:56:49,063 --> 01:56:51,055
May his soul rest in peace!

1504
01:56:51,145 --> 01:56:56,355
A friend of mine in India
died leaving behind Rs 100,000.

1505
01:56:56,563 --> 01:56:57,813
He had no children.

1506
01:56:57,938 --> 01:57:00,938
I brought the money
here to the man you know

1507
01:57:01,063 --> 01:57:04,228
who wears spectacles...
- Uncle!

1508
01:57:04,355 --> 01:57:09,188
Yes! I've given him the money,
with these cops as witnesses.

1509
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,313
Thank you very much.
- May God bless you!

1510
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,938
Let's go, darling!

1511
01:57:15,647 --> 01:57:20,098
My wife, son, won't you pay
your respects to your aunt?

1512
01:57:20,188 --> 01:57:23,022
Salutations, aunt!
- Bless you, son!

1513
01:57:23,145 --> 01:57:25,313
Bless you, my dear!

1514
01:57:26,145 --> 01:57:27,813
May God call you
to enjoy heaven, soon!

1515
01:57:28,022 --> 01:57:30,938
When God bestows riches,
He does so in abundance!

1516
01:57:33,355 --> 01:57:36,022
When you were going to
get Asha's inheritance

1517
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,438
why did you need to
kidnap that old man's child?

1518
01:57:38,563 --> 01:57:41,438
Don't kid me! Give me
my Rs 100,000, first.

1519
01:57:41,647 --> 01:57:43,055
We don't split that amount.

1520
01:57:43,145 --> 01:57:45,390
Rs 100,000? - Yes, the
one that uncle gave you.

1521
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:46,647
Uncle?

1522
01:57:46,813 --> 01:57:48,897
That old man has taken Asha
and gone to the police station!

1523
01:57:49,022 --> 01:57:50,395
To the police station?
- Yes.

1524
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,438
And I have brought
the solicitor here!

1525
01:57:52,688 --> 01:57:54,723
I think, the old man
has deceived both of us!

1526
01:57:54,813 --> 01:57:56,090
Yes!
- Shut up!

1527
01:58:01,228 --> 01:58:05,313
Mahesh, listen! Dad
is bringing the police.

1528
01:58:05,438 --> 01:58:06,897
Who is?
- My dad!

1529
01:58:07,022 --> 01:58:08,520
Arrest them.

1530
01:58:09,188 --> 01:58:12,063
Not me, them!

1531
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:15,605
I swear by God,
it's an unfair world!

1532
01:58:16,063 --> 01:58:18,348
I was freeing your daughter in
the presence of his sister

1533
01:58:18,438 --> 01:58:21,772
my wife, from the
clutches of that rogue Mahesh.

1534
01:58:22,395 --> 01:58:23,640
Wow!

1535
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:25,520
Such a man be damned!
- Damned.

1536
01:58:25,938 --> 01:58:28,138
I don't believe that. Arrest him!

1537
01:58:28,228 --> 01:58:29,682
Didn't you recognise me?

1538
01:58:29,772 --> 01:58:32,395
Remember, I had come to
find my nephew in your store?

1539
01:58:32,563 --> 01:58:36,640
The same rogue, Mahesh,
abducted him! It's his job!

1540
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:38,938
Oh, I remember now!

1541
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:42,848
You Indian people,
my country people.

1542
01:58:42,938 --> 01:58:44,938
No problem, my son.

1543
01:58:47,480 --> 01:58:49,480
I'm sorry.

1544
01:58:50,395 --> 01:58:51,520
No problem, my son.

1545
01:58:51,813 --> 01:58:53,430
Thank you.

1546
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,055
My girl is getting married
the day after tomorrow.

1547
01:58:55,145 --> 01:58:57,813
If I were not to find her today,
I'd have been highly humiliated!

1548
01:58:58,313 --> 01:58:59,813
I have another request to make.

1549
01:58:59,938 --> 01:59:01,265
Do attend the wedding.

1550
01:59:01,355 --> 01:59:02,438
Sure.

1551
01:59:04,228 --> 01:59:06,855
Brother-in-law, she's
getting married tomorrow.

1552
01:59:07,063 --> 01:59:08,772
At least, embrace the
child and bless her.

1553
01:59:08,897 --> 01:59:13,520
Indeed! My girl! My child!

1554
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,395
Before you leave, may
I greet your daughter?

1555
01:59:17,647 --> 01:59:18,772
Go ahead, my dear.

1556
01:59:19,228 --> 01:59:20,438
He's an elder.

1557
01:59:21,813 --> 01:59:24,438
May God keep you happy! And
my heartiest congratulations!

1558
01:59:24,897 --> 01:59:27,228
To you, too.
- To your father, too.

1559
01:59:28,897 --> 01:59:31,480
He hugs you like he's your father.

1560
01:59:31,605 --> 01:59:34,438
He sure is my wife's brother

1561
01:59:34,605 --> 01:59:37,980
but, when it comes to romance,
he beats all of us!

1562
01:59:38,228 --> 01:59:39,855
Let's go.

1563
01:59:41,145 --> 01:59:42,772
Do come for the wedding.

1564
01:59:42,897 --> 01:59:44,480
How can the marriage
take place, otherwise?

1565
01:59:51,763 --> 01:59:56,180
Ashok! Sheela is getting
married to Chatterjee!

1566
01:59:56,305 --> 01:59:58,720
Bride groom! Stop talking nonsense!

1567
01:59:59,138 --> 02:00:00,678
Wear this.

1568
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:04,923
Look in the mirror, and tell
me whom Sheela will marry.

1569
02:00:05,013 --> 02:00:06,553
What?

1570
02:00:12,888 --> 02:00:14,595
Set your hair properly.

1571
02:00:16,263 --> 02:00:19,220
A miracle! Hrishikesh Chatterjee!

1572
02:00:19,638 --> 02:00:21,965
Not Hrishikesh,
it's Bomkesh Chatterjee!

1573
02:00:22,055 --> 02:00:23,970
No, there's no bomb!

1574
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,257
Give Mahesh's photo to the cops

1575
02:00:30,347 --> 02:00:32,422
and ask them not let him inside.

1576
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,512
Okay, boss!

1577
02:00:34,388 --> 02:00:35,970
Hello!
- Come, come.

1578
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,338
Hello!
- Hello!

1579
02:00:43,428 --> 02:00:45,055
Take this.
- Thank you!

1580
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:46,840
Hasn't your wife's brother come?

1581
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:49,428
He forgot to tell you that
even he's getting married today.

1582
02:00:49,553 --> 02:00:52,553
At his age?
- He's allowed to marry 4 times.

1583
02:00:53,388 --> 02:00:58,428
Only such social functions
get us Indians together abroad.

1584
02:00:58,638 --> 02:01:01,138
Sir, all the guests have arrived.

1585
02:01:01,263 --> 02:01:03,013
Make them sit.
- I have.

1586
02:01:03,305 --> 02:01:05,338
Father-in-law, the
incantations have been read.

1587
02:01:05,428 --> 02:01:08,347
Yes, dear Chatterjee.
Priest, please begin the rituals.

1588
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,763
Father-in-law!

1589
02:01:21,888 --> 02:01:25,388
I think, that must be Mahesh.
Priest, continue the rituals.

1590
02:01:27,678 --> 02:01:29,138
I've no worries, now.

1591
02:01:29,428 --> 02:01:31,763
My daughter has
married a decent man.

1592
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:33,763
I will shoot him, now.

1593
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:36,673
Even if it means
getting hanged unto death!

1594
02:01:36,763 --> 02:01:38,220
Hey, priest.

1595
02:01:38,347 --> 02:01:41,055
I have come here with my people.

1596
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:42,845
Oh my God!

1597
02:01:44,595 --> 02:01:49,638
Father-in-law, I have come
here to marry your daughter.

1598
02:01:49,763 --> 02:01:52,463
I'm no beast. Keep the rifle aside!

1599
02:01:52,553 --> 02:01:54,095
Keep the rifle aside!

1600
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:06,638
I'm here and there also.

1601
02:02:09,138 --> 02:02:13,055
Chatterjee is here
as well as over there.

1602
02:02:13,470 --> 02:02:16,138
The bridegroom is here,
and there too.

1603
02:02:16,263 --> 02:02:18,888
I can't understand who
the actual groom is!

1604
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:22,055
I am!
- Indeed! Then, who is he?

1605
02:02:22,512 --> 02:02:24,095
I'll find out.

1606
02:02:24,305 --> 02:02:27,630
Hey! Who are you?
- Who are you?

1607
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:29,888
I am Hrishikesh Chatterjee!

1608
02:02:30,138 --> 02:02:32,055
I am Bomkesh Chatterjee!

1609
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:35,055
This girl is going to be my wife!

1610
02:02:35,512 --> 02:02:37,845
I have already
become the girl's husband!

1611
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:40,553
She is going to be my wife!

1612
02:02:40,888 --> 02:02:42,553
She was going to be your wife.

1613
02:02:42,803 --> 02:02:44,930
She is your sister, now!
- From which angle?

1614
02:02:45,388 --> 02:02:48,470
It's an Indian viewpoint.
From the Indian angle!

1615
02:02:48,595 --> 02:02:51,338
One man's wife is considered
to be another man's sister.

1616
02:02:51,428 --> 02:02:53,428
Are you twins?

1617
02:02:53,678 --> 02:02:57,428
He is not a twin brother, but
he sure is everybody's father!

1618
02:02:57,553 --> 02:02:59,720
The things your love
has made me do!

1619
02:03:00,055 --> 02:03:02,298
Yes, brother?
What do you have to say?

1620
02:03:02,388 --> 02:03:04,338
I will kill you!

1621
02:03:04,428 --> 02:03:08,055
He's the rogue Mahesh!
Priest, undo the wedding ceremony!

1622
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:12,845
She has become his wife. Give
your daughter away to him, now.

1623
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:15,470
Everything has been done, now!

1624
02:03:15,595 --> 02:03:17,013
Oh, no!

1625
02:03:17,138 --> 02:03:20,888
Take care of him, while I
take care of his daughter!

1626
02:03:22,013 --> 02:03:24,428
Come on!
- I'll show you! - Mr Chatterjee!

1627
02:03:24,553 --> 02:03:26,388
Congratulations!

1628
02:03:42,428 --> 02:03:43,388
Sheela!

1629
02:03:44,347 --> 02:03:45,428
My honey!

1630
02:03:46,930 --> 02:03:48,138
Duke of Winston renounced England

1631
02:03:49,347 --> 02:03:53,930
in order to win over his beloved.

1632
02:03:54,763 --> 02:03:59,888
And I left my shanty in my
beloved land, India, to win you.

1633
02:04:00,553 --> 02:04:05,138
The shanty which my deceased father

1634
02:04:05,595 --> 02:04:09,220
had built near the banks of Ganga.

1635
02:04:09,845 --> 02:04:11,055
Anyway, forget about all that.

1636
02:04:11,888 --> 02:04:15,220
No being bashful tonight.
Unveil your face.

1637
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:20,970
The phone! It must
be that stupid Ashok!

1638
02:04:25,595 --> 02:04:26,638
Are you feeling coy

1639
02:04:28,055 --> 02:04:28,970
because of the light?

1640
02:04:30,220 --> 02:04:31,553
I'll switch it off right now.

1641
02:04:36,305 --> 02:04:39,970
Now, the Indian rocket
is nearing the moon.

1642
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:50,930
Sheela, are you slipping
away? Or is it the cot?

1643
02:04:51,055 --> 02:04:52,512
Sheela.

1644
02:05:00,055 --> 02:05:02,840
Mahesh are you slipping away?
Or is it the cot?

1645
02:05:02,930 --> 02:05:05,138
Something is slipping away alright.

1646
02:05:05,803 --> 02:05:07,845
Sheela.

1647
02:05:11,388 --> 02:05:13,845
Oh God, please have
mercy on my husband!

1648
02:05:14,055 --> 02:05:15,763
Sheela.

1649
02:05:16,512 --> 02:05:20,180
I thought your dad was
the only enemy I had in Japan.

1650
02:05:20,428 --> 02:05:22,970
But this bed seems worse than him!

1651
02:05:23,220 --> 02:05:25,388
I'd heard of cots breaking.

1652
02:05:25,553 --> 02:05:27,512
But I'm seeing a cot
fly for the first time!

1653
02:05:27,970 --> 02:05:30,678
Ask your ancestors to have
the cot lowered a little.

1654
02:05:31,595 --> 02:05:33,347
Lower. Lower.

1655
02:05:33,888 --> 02:05:36,428
Even lower. Grandpa!

1656
02:05:37,013 --> 02:05:39,638
Thank God.
- Ouch!

1657
02:05:40,845 --> 02:05:43,048
Sheela. Sheela.

1658
02:05:43,138 --> 02:05:45,428
Sheela. Sheela.

1659
02:05:45,845 --> 02:05:47,305
Sheela.

1660
02:05:48,013 --> 02:05:50,970
Oh, messenger of death!
Oh, heartless fan!

1661
02:05:51,305 --> 02:05:54,845
I have never been hanged
but I sure have heard that

1662
02:05:55,180 --> 02:06:00,013
before being hanged to death,
one's last wish is fulfilled.

1663
02:06:02,013 --> 02:06:03,720
What is your dying wish?

1664
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:08,180
I see! So, it was, you
in the form of a fan?

1665
02:06:08,388 --> 02:06:11,347
And, sister-in-law, even
you were part of this?

1666
02:06:11,845 --> 02:06:14,888
Darling Sheela! We'll seek
revenge for this rotten trick!

1667
02:06:15,013 --> 02:06:16,763
Come on!

1668
02:06:16,888 --> 02:06:19,638
Sheela.
- What is this? Mahesh!

1669
02:06:21,888 --> 02:06:24,638
Ashok, stop that madman!

1670
02:06:25,220 --> 02:06:29,512
Asha, love does not cross limits,
unless it drives a man insane.

1671
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:33,638
This madman wants
to cage you today.

1672
02:06:34,388 --> 02:06:37,305
With a token of his insanity.

1673
02:06:38,305 --> 02:06:40,470
Promise me, that you
will never remove it.

1674
02:06:41,803 --> 02:06:46,512
If I could, I would keep this
token of a madman in my heart!

1675
02:06:47,678 --> 02:06:52,388
Whether the madman remains or not,
his token will surely remain.

1676
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:55,305
The elders have aptly said

1677
02:06:55,428 --> 02:06:58,923
a man turns insane in
the company of mad people.

1678
02:06:59,013 --> 02:07:01,678
Give this insane man
the permission, today.

1679
02:07:02,678 --> 02:07:09,055
Let these luscious lips on
this beautiful face be...

1680
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:00,095
"This gathering, to enjoy life."

1681
02:08:00,678 --> 02:08:03,512
"Both of us are alone."

1682
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:09,012
"Some kiss and some
play with tresses."

1683
02:08:10,355 --> 02:08:13,855
"Come dear, come to me."

1684
02:08:14,690 --> 02:08:17,980
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1685
02:08:19,063 --> 02:08:22,732
"Walk into my
heart through my eyes."

1686
02:08:23,355 --> 02:08:26,980
"Come dear, come to me."

1687
02:08:27,690 --> 02:08:30,732
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1688
02:08:32,023 --> 02:08:36,148
"Walk into my
heart through my eyes."

1689
02:08:36,355 --> 02:08:39,773
"Come dear, come to me."

1690
02:08:59,897 --> 02:09:03,938
"The ambience is romantic."

1691
02:09:04,188 --> 02:09:08,315
"But, the wound in my
heart is still fresh."

1692
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:12,480
"The ambience is romantic."

1693
02:09:12,813 --> 02:09:16,813
"But, the wound in my
heart is still fresh."

1694
02:09:17,023 --> 02:09:21,023
"Put your head on my shoulder."

1695
02:09:21,440 --> 02:09:25,605
"You have the cure for my heart."

1696
02:09:25,813 --> 02:09:29,188
"Come dear, come to me."

1697
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:33,565
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1698
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:38,523
"Walk into my
heart through my eyes."

1699
02:09:38,773 --> 02:09:42,148
"Come dear, come to me."

1700
02:10:00,230 --> 02:10:04,480
"Whom do I show my suffering to?"

1701
02:10:04,605 --> 02:10:08,807
"How do I disguise
this raging storm?"

1702
02:10:08,897 --> 02:10:12,938
"Whom do I show my suffering to?"

1703
02:10:13,230 --> 02:10:17,273
"How do I disguise
this raging storm?"

1704
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:21,642
"What my eyes are seeing"

1705
02:10:21,732 --> 02:10:25,938
"how it affects my
heart, how do I say that?"

1706
02:10:26,105 --> 02:10:29,855
"Come dear, come to me."

1707
02:10:30,398 --> 02:10:32,980
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1708
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:38,648
"Walk into my
heart through my eyes."

1709
02:10:38,980 --> 02:10:41,480
"Come dear, come to me."

1710
02:11:02,648 --> 02:11:06,690
"Your heart is ablaze"

1711
02:11:06,855 --> 02:11:11,023
"my heart is ablaze too."

1712
02:11:11,148 --> 02:11:15,148
"You heart is ablaze"

1713
02:11:15,355 --> 02:11:19,480
"my heart is ablaze too."

1714
02:11:19,605 --> 02:11:23,813
"Both of us are in
the same condition."

1715
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:27,855
"Both of us have been
struck by lightning."

1716
02:11:28,273 --> 02:11:31,938
"Come dear, come to me."

1717
02:11:32,523 --> 02:11:35,980
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1718
02:11:36,813 --> 02:11:40,855
"Walk into my
heart through my eyes."

1719
02:11:41,105 --> 02:11:44,523
"Come dear, come to me."

1720
02:11:45,273 --> 02:11:48,813
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1721
02:11:49,648 --> 02:11:53,605
"Walk into my
heart through my eyes."

1722
02:11:53,897 --> 02:11:57,063
"Come dear, come to me."

1723
02:11:58,023 --> 02:12:01,023
"Come, swaying into my arms."

1724
02:12:02,188 --> 02:12:05,690
"Come dear, come to me."

1725
02:12:07,148 --> 02:12:09,273
Ma'am, I'm surprised
you're not ready yet.

1726
02:12:09,523 --> 02:12:11,648
The tourists won't wait for you
for a long time.

1727
02:12:12,732 --> 02:12:14,683
What's taking you so long?

1728
02:12:14,773 --> 02:12:16,230
The one who had to die
is already dead.

1729
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,813
Let me take off my sandals!
- Do it later.

1730
02:12:20,773 --> 02:12:23,315
What are you doing?

1731
02:12:35,737 --> 02:12:38,315
Asha, she is my mother.

1732
02:12:39,023 --> 02:12:43,023
She took great care of Chikoo,
and served him when he was ill.

1733
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:46,355
And perhaps she
was serving even now?

1734
02:12:46,565 --> 02:12:51,642
The things girls these days
give up for the sake of money!

1735
02:12:51,732 --> 02:12:52,855
Sir!

1736
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:54,475
Aren't you ashamed

1737
02:12:54,565 --> 02:12:56,440
of speaking so loosely
about a decent girl?

1738
02:12:56,938 --> 02:12:59,148
Parents are also responsible

1739
02:12:59,897 --> 02:13:02,188
for the upbringing
of respectable girls!

1740
02:13:02,648 --> 02:13:04,813
Decency adheres to this belief.

1741
02:13:05,315 --> 02:13:10,188
What do the unfortunate girls
who're orphaned in childhood do?

1742
02:13:10,648 --> 02:13:13,648
What she did, today!

1743
02:13:13,813 --> 02:13:17,188
Society calls them a tramp!
- Mom!

1744
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:19,897
Mom, you are someone's mother, too.

1745
02:13:20,063 --> 02:13:22,398
Someday, she will grace
someone's household.

1746
02:13:22,523 --> 02:13:24,230
Even she will become a mother!

1747
02:13:24,355 --> 02:13:26,565
God has snatched away
that right from her!

1748
02:13:27,023 --> 02:13:28,848
God makes one's destiny
based on their conduct.

1749
02:13:28,938 --> 02:13:33,732
Implying, God has sent some unlucky

1750
02:13:33,938 --> 02:13:35,480
ones to ill-fated homes?

1751
02:13:35,732 --> 02:13:37,398
And they have even
been termed immoral!

1752
02:13:37,648 --> 02:13:38,855
Certainly!

1753
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,273
If this is what your
God and you feel

1754
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:43,315
then I turn down such a God!

1755
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:46,732
Will you speak ill of God for
the sake of such a girl?

1756
02:13:46,897 --> 02:13:49,480
God resides, not in the
glittering idols of temples

1757
02:13:49,648 --> 02:13:51,890
but, in a man's heart!

1758
02:13:51,980 --> 02:13:54,765
In the form of love!

1759
02:13:54,855 --> 02:13:57,308
Ashok! - If possible, weigh
love on one scale

1760
02:13:57,398 --> 02:13:59,058
and the world on another!

1761
02:13:59,148 --> 02:14:03,480
If love outweighs the world,
then consider it to be God!

1762
02:14:04,813 --> 02:14:10,565
How much money do you want
for your farcical love?

1763
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:17,773
If you've any decency left,
then go away from this world!

1764
02:14:18,897 --> 02:14:23,565
One can buy integrity
and life with money.

1765
02:14:24,148 --> 02:14:27,807
But, not the God residing
in one's heart, mother!

1766
02:14:27,897 --> 02:14:31,188
Mother! You called me mother!
Impertinent girl!

1767
02:14:31,315 --> 02:14:36,023
Mom! - Ashok, for the sake of
our love, don't say a word more!

1768
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:40,938
Remember! Unless you have
your mother's blessing

1769
02:14:41,063 --> 02:14:46,480
your prayers will
never be answered!

1770
02:14:47,355 --> 02:14:50,148
I swear, I'm honoured

1771
02:14:50,897 --> 02:14:53,023
that someone has at
least deemed me worthy of this.

1772
02:14:54,732 --> 02:14:58,315
Why would she take the money,
when she knows very well

1773
02:14:58,703 --> 02:15:03,315
that by trapping Ashok,
she can own his millions?

1774
02:15:05,738 --> 02:15:07,363
Rude boy!

1775
02:15:07,488 --> 02:15:08,988
Sarita.

1776
02:15:09,113 --> 02:15:10,738
She did the right thing!

1777
02:15:11,345 --> 02:15:13,930
Sir, call and have this brat

1778
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:17,220
taken to an delinquent
orphanage, right now!

1779
02:15:17,345 --> 02:15:20,763
He attacked you today.
Tomorrow, it could be his grandma!

1780
02:15:20,972 --> 02:15:22,722
You are not my grandma!
- Shut up!

1781
02:15:22,847 --> 02:15:27,595
You aren't my grandma! I've
nobody in this world except aunt!

1782
02:15:27,722 --> 02:15:30,888
Aunt, you can't leave me alone!

1783
02:15:31,763 --> 02:15:35,220
I am not willing to
take such a child with me.

1784
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:39,930
By hitting sir, you have ruined
my image further in their eyes.

1785
02:15:40,055 --> 02:15:41,847
He was speaking ill about you!

1786
02:15:41,972 --> 02:15:44,847
Look, a person does not become bad

1787
02:15:44,972 --> 02:15:46,888
just because someone
speaks ill about him.

1788
02:15:47,220 --> 02:15:51,513
A man is known by his deeds.

1789
02:15:52,513 --> 02:15:54,972
If you really love me

1790
02:15:56,013 --> 02:15:59,055
then, hold Rai
sir's feet and apologise.

1791
02:15:59,888 --> 02:16:02,470
Love your grandma.

1792
02:16:03,097 --> 02:16:07,055
She is the mother of
your deceased father.

1793
02:16:07,333 --> 02:16:09,748
No! She means nothing to me!

1794
02:16:09,958 --> 02:16:13,958
Don't say that, or I will
not talk to you all my life!

1795
02:16:14,623 --> 02:16:16,958
I will never see you, again!

1796
02:16:17,083 --> 02:16:18,958
Don't cry, partner.

1797
02:16:19,457 --> 02:16:22,125
I will go and apologise right now.

1798
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:30,457
Sir, please forgive me.

1799
02:16:31,583 --> 02:16:33,708
Grandma, forgive me.

1800
02:16:33,833 --> 02:16:36,875
Aunt asked me to apologise to you.

1801
02:16:37,125 --> 02:16:40,373
Give me any punishment you wish.

1802
02:16:42,373 --> 02:16:46,208
Uncle, please ask
your mother to forgive me!

1803
02:16:46,488 --> 02:16:48,708
I don't even have a mother!

1804
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,542
If all of you hate me,

1805
02:16:55,667 --> 02:16:58,500
then I, myself,
will go the orphanage.

1806
02:17:00,728 --> 02:17:03,477
Chikoo! My darling!

1807
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:10,643
Grandma, have you forgiven me?
Now, forgive aunt as well.

1808
02:17:11,432 --> 02:17:16,348
Aunt! Grandma has forgiven me!

1809
02:17:16,890 --> 02:17:18,225
Uncle!

1810
02:17:18,975 --> 02:17:22,010
Uncle! I wonder,
where aunt has gone.

1811
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:24,383
She forgot this ring here.

1812
02:17:24,473 --> 02:17:28,100
'I will keep this token
of a madman in my heart!'

1813
02:17:28,308 --> 02:17:29,765
Asha.

1814
02:17:34,058 --> 02:17:36,975
'I have no one. I am alone.'

1815
02:17:37,473 --> 02:17:39,183
'I have nobody, either.'

1816
02:17:39,933 --> 02:17:42,383
'Are you going to God?'

1817
02:17:42,473 --> 02:17:45,558
'Yes, we are together
and will never be apart.'

1818
02:17:45,683 --> 02:17:47,640
'Promise?
- Promise!'

1819
02:18:04,183 --> 02:18:06,598
'Silly girl! Are you crying
over a child?'

1820
02:18:07,058 --> 02:18:08,808
'In the city of Hiroshima'

1821
02:18:09,308 --> 02:18:11,473
'when the atom bombs
were dropped here'

1822
02:18:11,598 --> 02:18:13,765
'thousands of innocents
were killed.'

1823
02:18:14,308 --> 02:18:17,140
'Schools were burnt down
and the young were killed.'

1824
02:18:18,348 --> 02:18:23,015
'I wish, I'd died with them.'

1825
02:18:23,225 --> 02:18:26,183
'Your world would still
be the same.'

1826
02:18:26,390 --> 02:18:28,558
'Who will I live for?'

1827
02:18:28,850 --> 02:18:31,267
'Those who are in love don't live'

1828
02:18:31,598 --> 02:18:33,890
'they die for each other.'

1829
02:18:34,183 --> 02:18:36,933
'In lieu for your false love'

1830
02:18:37,225 --> 02:18:39,432
'how much money do you want?'

1831
02:18:40,593 --> 02:18:43,473
'If you have any decency'

1832
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:46,890
'you should die!'

1833
02:18:48,255 --> 02:18:51,267
'Don't ever show your face
in this world again!'

1834
02:19:17,473 --> 02:19:21,348
"O my darling..."

1835
02:19:21,843 --> 02:19:26,088
"O my beloved..."

1836
02:19:26,178 --> 02:19:30,462
"You are with me."

1837
02:19:30,552 --> 02:19:34,510
"There is no one else."

1838
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:38,878
"You are with me."

1839
02:19:38,968 --> 02:19:43,093
"There is no one else."

1840
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:46,803
"O my darling..."

1841
02:19:47,135 --> 02:19:51,010
"O my beloved..."

1842
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:55,420
"You are with me."

1843
02:19:55,510 --> 02:20:00,053
"There is no one else."

1844
02:20:24,302 --> 02:20:30,220
"The dreams are shattered."

1845
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:35,803
"There is suffering at every step."

1846
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:42,510
"Wherever I go"

1847
02:20:42,635 --> 02:20:47,968
"you image comes along too."

1848
02:20:48,593 --> 02:20:52,677
"O my darling..."

1849
02:20:52,968 --> 02:20:56,928
"O my beloved..."

1850
02:20:57,178 --> 02:21:01,427
"You are with me."

1851
02:21:01,552 --> 02:21:05,468
"There is no one else."

1852
02:21:21,677 --> 02:21:27,718
"You exist in the
flowers and in the garden."

1853
02:21:27,928 --> 02:21:33,635
"You are in every atom
that exist around me."

1854
02:21:34,010 --> 02:21:39,928
"I saw you everywhere."

1855
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:45,010
"You exist in my soul."

1856
02:21:45,843 --> 02:21:49,718
"O my darling..."

1857
02:21:50,093 --> 02:21:54,093
"O my beloved..."

1858
02:21:54,302 --> 02:21:58,545
"You are with me."

1859
02:21:58,635 --> 02:22:02,378
"There is no one else."

1860
02:22:02,468 --> 02:22:03,385
Asha.

1861
02:22:31,178 --> 02:22:32,718
My son!

1862
02:22:35,302 --> 02:22:39,300
Gayatri Devi, God willing,
everything will be all right.

1863
02:22:39,468 --> 02:22:43,760
India's renowned surgeon will
be performing the operation.

1864
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:46,795
And he is right
here in this hospital.

1865
02:22:46,885 --> 02:22:49,053
Aunt, uncle is all right, isn't he?

1866
02:22:49,178 --> 02:22:51,928
You jinxed woman! You are here!

1867
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:55,718
Get out of my sight!

1868
02:22:56,343 --> 02:22:59,427
Didn't you hear what I
said? Get out of here!

1869
02:23:00,885 --> 02:23:04,302
My son was punished
for the sin you committed!

1870
02:23:04,677 --> 02:23:06,510
Yet, you didn't let
him stay in peace!

1871
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:10,385
You have hurt a mother!

1872
02:23:11,093 --> 02:23:13,468
You have ruined a happy home!

1873
02:23:13,968 --> 02:23:17,385
You have snatched away the
apple of my eye from me!

1874
02:23:18,302 --> 02:23:20,135
You will never be happy!

1875
02:23:20,843 --> 02:23:23,135
A mother curses you so!

1876
02:23:23,302 --> 02:23:25,295
Go away!
- Silence, please!

1877
02:23:25,385 --> 02:23:27,843
Nurse, throw her out!

1878
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:32,803
She has nothing to do with
our family! Throw her out!

1879
02:23:37,343 --> 02:23:39,253
Doctor.
- You are?

1880
02:23:39,343 --> 02:23:41,803
I'm the unfortunate
mother of Ashok.

1881
02:23:41,928 --> 02:23:44,635
The operation was a success,

1882
02:23:44,928 --> 02:23:47,718
but, I fear that once
he recovers completely

1883
02:23:48,968 --> 02:23:51,135
he may turn blind.

1884
02:23:55,885 --> 02:23:57,843
Please, do something!

1885
02:23:58,010 --> 02:24:00,343
He's my only son!

1886
02:24:01,135 --> 02:24:02,928
The sole heir to my family!

1887
02:24:03,093 --> 02:24:05,803
A mother's prayers are
the best remedy for a son.

1888
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:09,135
You pray, while I treat him.

1889
02:24:12,677 --> 02:24:14,093
Sir.

1890
02:24:14,677 --> 02:24:16,885
Mom, wait here.

1891
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:18,760
I'll go to the temple right away

1892
02:24:18,885 --> 02:24:21,010
and pray for Ashok's well-being.

1893
02:24:21,302 --> 02:24:22,510
Let's go, dad.

1894
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:25,093
Gayatri Devi, did you see that?

1895
02:24:25,635 --> 02:24:27,427
This is called love!

1896
02:24:27,885 --> 02:24:29,300
Let's go, dear.

1897
02:24:30,843 --> 02:24:34,718
Dear God, please protect my child!

1898
02:24:35,053 --> 02:24:36,385
I have come for the reason that...

1899
02:24:37,178 --> 02:24:38,593
God forbid,

1900
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:41,593
but if Ashok
has to lose his eyesight

1901
02:24:42,385 --> 02:24:45,093
then I am willing
to donate my eyes!

1902
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:48,135
But, how can a doctor take
the eyes of a live person?

1903
02:24:48,427 --> 02:24:49,718
Please, doctor!

1904
02:24:49,843 --> 02:24:52,885
But, I believe, Ashok is getting
married to somebody else?

1905
02:24:53,928 --> 02:24:55,593
What difference does that make?

1906
02:24:57,220 --> 02:24:59,300
Relationships may differ.

1907
02:25:00,427 --> 02:25:03,178
But, nobody can
snatch away anyone's love.

1908
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:08,343
When he recovers, he will
see his face in the mirror.

1909
02:25:09,302 --> 02:25:10,843
He will think of me.

1910
02:25:11,968 --> 02:25:13,885
Wherever I may be,
my non-existent eyes

1911
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:17,220
will sparkle at that moment.

1912
02:25:17,928 --> 02:25:22,968
And in that light, I will
surely be able to see him!

1913
02:25:23,135 --> 02:25:26,468
I will surely not
marry a blind Ashok!

1914
02:25:26,593 --> 02:25:30,093
Society will ridicule me
for being a blind man's wife!

1915
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:34,343
In fact, society will admire you!

1916
02:25:34,552 --> 02:25:37,753
For sacrificing your life
for the sake of a blind man!

1917
02:25:37,843 --> 02:25:41,928
But, how will I spend my
life with a blind man?

1918
02:25:42,053 --> 02:25:46,427
A blind man lives his life
with the support of a stick.

1919
02:25:46,677 --> 02:25:48,713
And you will live your
life with the help

1920
02:25:48,803 --> 02:25:50,427
of a blind man's wealth!

1921
02:25:50,552 --> 02:25:53,843
What do you think?
- You're great, dad.

1922
02:25:54,178 --> 02:25:55,928
Simply great.

1923
02:25:56,053 --> 02:25:59,718
Oh, Goddess of Wealth,
help my daughter!

1924
02:26:08,220 --> 02:26:09,302
Ashok!

1925
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:11,510
My son!

1926
02:26:12,178 --> 02:26:13,718
Asha!

1927
02:26:16,677 --> 02:26:18,843
Nurse, take him to the dark room.

1928
02:26:22,718 --> 02:26:23,803
Doctor.

1929
02:26:26,178 --> 02:26:27,462
Doctor.

1930
02:26:27,552 --> 02:26:29,420
Please, remove my eyes

1931
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:32,302
and restore the
eyesight of my child!

1932
02:26:32,718 --> 02:26:34,677
I respect your sentiments.

1933
02:26:35,010 --> 02:26:37,928
But, the problem is
that I'd need eyes

1934
02:26:38,053 --> 02:26:41,053
of a young person for Ashok.

1935
02:26:41,300 --> 02:26:44,053
I'd have willingly donated mine.

1936
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:48,928
But, unfortunately,
my eyes won't be of any use.

1937
02:26:51,510 --> 02:26:53,260
My dear.

1938
02:26:54,803 --> 02:26:57,635
A wife's duty is to sacrifice.
- What?

1939
02:26:58,633 --> 02:26:59,968
Do you know Dhrithrashtra,

1940
02:27:01,175 --> 02:27:03,302
the father of legendary Kauravas

1941
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:05,633
was blind since birth?

1942
02:27:06,508 --> 02:27:09,758
When his wife,
Gandhari, heard of it

1943
02:27:10,135 --> 02:27:16,135
she blindfolded herself for life!

1944
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:20,135
That was in the old days,
when everyone lacked any sense!

1945
02:27:20,302 --> 02:27:22,010
Sarita!

1946
02:27:22,135 --> 02:27:24,302
Don't worry, mom.

1947
02:27:24,467 --> 02:27:27,175
Ashok can see the
world through my eyes.

1948
02:27:27,550 --> 02:27:29,593
Let him turn blind.

1949
02:27:30,050 --> 02:27:31,758
What?

1950
02:27:32,467 --> 02:27:34,843
Is this the answer to my question?

1951
02:27:35,175 --> 02:27:37,050
You seem very sensible!

1952
02:27:37,218 --> 02:27:39,343
After all, whose
daughter-in-law is she?

1953
02:27:39,467 --> 02:27:41,010
Quiet!

1954
02:27:41,302 --> 02:27:43,425
Quiet! Please be quiet!

1955
02:27:44,968 --> 02:27:46,718
There was a time

1956
02:27:47,175 --> 02:27:48,550
when wives would
immolate themselves.

1957
02:27:48,675 --> 02:27:50,925
In the funeral pyres
of their husbands!

1958
02:27:51,302 --> 02:27:52,170
And today?

1959
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:54,550
Even today, there
are some Indian girls

1960
02:27:54,675 --> 02:27:57,633
who, in spite of
being rejected in love

1961
02:27:57,758 --> 02:27:59,925
are ready to make any kind
of sacrifices for their beloved!

1962
02:28:12,343 --> 02:28:14,050
Please, don't refuse me.

1963
02:28:14,508 --> 02:28:19,425
People adorn God with gems and
jewellery and make Him sparkle!

1964
02:28:20,175 --> 02:28:22,050
Please permit me

1965
02:28:23,550 --> 02:28:28,800
to bestow the twinkle
of my eyes to your son

1966
02:28:29,175 --> 02:28:33,343
so that the light of your
house keeps shining forever!

1967
02:28:34,010 --> 02:28:35,925
Please do not refuse, mother!

1968
02:28:36,508 --> 02:28:39,593
In this way, an unfortunate
girl's life may get blessed!

1969
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:41,050
Asha!

1970
02:29:07,343 --> 02:29:08,260
Mahesh!

1971
02:29:15,843 --> 02:29:17,135
Congratulations, Gayatri Devi!

1972
02:29:17,302 --> 02:29:19,800
The Lord has heeded
my daughter's prayers.

1973
02:29:20,050 --> 02:29:22,175
No celebrations will suffice!

1974
02:29:22,343 --> 02:29:25,508
No amount of mourning
will suffice, sir!

1975
02:29:25,843 --> 02:29:28,467
The Goddess of wealth
did not heed you!

1976
02:29:28,968 --> 02:29:31,377
Grandma, sir was saying

1977
02:29:31,467 --> 02:29:34,843
that the blind man will
spend his life with his stick.

1978
02:29:35,093 --> 02:29:38,633
But, his daughter would
make merry with our wealth!

1979
02:29:38,925 --> 02:29:40,795
He lies!

1980
02:29:40,885 --> 02:29:42,383
Does he?

1981
02:29:43,218 --> 02:29:46,633
My grandson has been able to
see through your schemes so well!

1982
02:29:47,550 --> 02:29:50,260
It will be better
if a vile man like you

1983
02:29:50,383 --> 02:29:53,218
gets lost with your vile daughter!

1984
02:29:53,383 --> 02:29:55,260
But...
- Shut up!

1985
02:29:55,843 --> 02:29:59,293
Mahesh! Drive them away from here!

1986
02:29:59,383 --> 02:30:02,135
What do you think...
I mean, your father?

1987
02:30:02,425 --> 02:30:05,675
Here are the tickets!
- And here's the taxi fare!

1988
02:30:06,425 --> 02:30:09,135
Let's go, sir!

1989
02:30:09,383 --> 02:30:10,885
I'll show you the way out.

1990
02:30:11,135 --> 02:30:12,675
Sir.

1991
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:17,550
Please, take this torch with you.

1992
02:30:17,925 --> 02:30:19,460
It may prove handy.

1993
02:30:19,550 --> 02:30:24,593
Light this and search for a
blind boy for your talented girl!

1994
02:30:26,467 --> 02:30:29,212
Gayatri Devi, permit me
to make arrangements

1995
02:30:29,302 --> 02:30:34,593
for my younger daughter, Asha
and Ashok's engagement in Tokyo.

1996
02:30:35,175 --> 02:30:36,593
Sure!

1997
02:30:46,758 --> 02:30:51,383
Just as, food tastes
bland without any spices

1998
02:30:51,675 --> 02:30:55,425
a joyous occasion is
incomplete without music.

1999
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:59,175
So, I would request mother

2000
02:30:59,343 --> 02:31:02,383
to permit sister-in-law to sing.

2001
02:31:27,302 --> 02:31:31,010
"I have got you, oh darling."

2002
02:31:31,343 --> 02:31:35,050
"I could have
nothing better than you."

2003
02:31:35,218 --> 02:31:38,843
"Wherever I see, I see you."

2004
02:31:38,968 --> 02:31:42,633
"I could have seen
nothing better than you."

2005
02:31:42,758 --> 02:31:46,633
"I have got you, oh darling."

2006
02:31:46,758 --> 02:31:50,175
"I could have
nothing better than you."

2007
02:31:50,343 --> 02:31:54,003
"Wherever I see, I see you."

2008
02:31:54,093 --> 02:31:57,745
"I could have seen
nothing better than you."

2009
02:31:57,835 --> 02:32:02,010
"I have got you, oh darling."

2010
02:32:28,015 --> 02:32:31,758
"Someone's handsome face..."

2011
02:32:31,885 --> 02:32:35,925
"I adore with my eyes."

2012
02:32:39,383 --> 02:32:43,093
"Someone's handsome face..."

2013
02:32:43,218 --> 02:32:46,925
"I adore with my eyes."

2014
02:32:47,050 --> 02:32:54,377
"It is the limit of happiness,
I delight in it."

2015
02:32:54,467 --> 02:32:58,218
"I delight in it."

2016
02:32:58,343 --> 02:33:02,135
"My future has been brightened..."

2017
02:33:02,383 --> 02:33:06,093
"I could not have a better
star to brighten my life."

2018
02:33:06,218 --> 02:33:09,843
"Wherever I look, I see you."

2019
02:33:10,010 --> 02:33:13,628
"I could have seen
nothing better than you."

2020
02:33:13,718 --> 02:33:17,925
"I have found you, oh darling."

2021
02:33:29,135 --> 02:33:33,010
Asha, your Chikoo
is safe in my custody.

2022
02:33:33,425 --> 02:33:37,968
His life depends on your consent.
- Uncle!

2023
02:33:38,218 --> 02:33:40,550
Asha, if you marry Pran

2024
02:33:40,675 --> 02:33:42,425
you can save him.

2025
02:33:42,718 --> 02:33:48,175
If you seek the help of cops...
- Aunt! Let me die! Aunt, help me.

2026
02:34:16,383 --> 02:34:20,260
"I have tears in my eyes"

2027
02:34:20,383 --> 02:34:24,010
"but, they are tears of happiness."

2028
02:34:31,425 --> 02:34:35,050
"I have tears in my eye"

2029
02:34:35,302 --> 02:34:38,800
"but, they are tears of happiness."

2030
02:34:39,093 --> 02:34:42,633
"Whom do I leave, whom to accept"

2031
02:34:42,800 --> 02:34:46,418
"these relationships are for life."

2032
02:34:46,508 --> 02:34:50,050
"These relationships are for life."

2033
02:34:50,383 --> 02:34:54,135
"I am proud of you..."

2034
02:34:54,343 --> 02:34:58,093
"I should have someone like you."

2035
02:34:58,218 --> 02:35:01,800
"Wherever I see, I see you."

2036
02:35:01,925 --> 02:35:05,593
"I could have seen
nothing better than you."

2037
02:35:05,718 --> 02:35:09,718
"I have got you, oh darling."

2038
02:35:35,467 --> 02:35:39,135
"I have my heart over there,
and here is my life."

2039
02:35:39,260 --> 02:35:43,383
"This is the cause of the problem."

2040
02:35:46,800 --> 02:35:50,467
"I have my heart over there,
and here is my life."

2041
02:35:50,593 --> 02:35:54,175
"This is the cause of the problem."

2042
02:35:54,302 --> 02:35:58,010
"I have a smile on my lips."

2043
02:35:58,135 --> 02:36:01,758
"But, a storm rages in my heart."

2044
02:36:01,885 --> 02:36:05,508
"But, a storm rages in my heart."

2045
02:36:05,675 --> 02:36:09,550
"You know and I know"

2046
02:36:09,675 --> 02:36:13,377
"there could be no
better way to signal."

2047
02:36:13,467 --> 02:36:17,093
"Wherever I see, I see you."

2048
02:36:17,218 --> 02:36:20,885
"I could have seen
nothing better than you."

2049
02:36:21,010 --> 02:36:23,085
"I have got you, oh darling."

2050
02:36:23,175 --> 02:36:25,467
Asha!
- Leave me!

2051
02:36:25,765 --> 02:36:27,260
What's wrong with you?

2052
02:36:28,175 --> 02:36:30,260
Try and forget me.

2053
02:36:30,593 --> 02:36:31,758
Forget you?

2054
02:36:31,925 --> 02:36:35,135
Darling, if you can't
tell him, then I will.

2055
02:36:35,383 --> 02:36:39,128
Mr Ashok, old love
does not perish so easily.

2056
02:36:39,218 --> 02:36:41,135
Pran! I'll kill you!

2057
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:43,508
You've not only defamed Asha,
but my family honour too!

2058
02:36:43,633 --> 02:36:46,758
How long will I keep shut for
the sake of my family's honour?

2059
02:36:47,675 --> 02:36:49,383
Asha loved Pran,

2060
02:36:50,593 --> 02:36:53,010
and had this child out of wedlock.

2061
02:36:54,675 --> 02:36:56,383
Uncle.
- Asha,

2062
02:36:57,003 --> 02:36:58,245
this...

2063
02:36:58,335 --> 02:37:01,003
Mom, it's all a lie.
He is Asha's uncle.

2064
02:37:01,212 --> 02:37:03,753
Even if God tells me this about
Asha, I wouldn't believe Him!

2065
02:37:04,212 --> 02:37:06,245
Asha, say that, this is
a conspiracy, a lie!

2066
02:37:06,335 --> 02:37:08,628
This is a matter of great
shame for decent people like us!

2067
02:37:09,045 --> 02:37:10,837
Brother couldn't bear this trauma.

2068
02:37:11,128 --> 02:37:13,795
I tried to get her married to Pran.

2069
02:37:14,003 --> 02:37:15,710
To save the honour of the family.

2070
02:37:16,460 --> 02:37:20,003
You will have to give an answer.

2071
02:37:21,003 --> 02:37:23,418
My son's life is at stake here.

2072
02:37:25,795 --> 02:37:28,253
Why are you quiet?
Why don't you answer?

2073
02:37:31,418 --> 02:37:33,418
Please forgive me, mother.

2074
02:37:35,253 --> 02:37:37,962
An innocent child's
life is at stake, here.

2075
02:37:38,503 --> 02:37:39,795
Asha.

2076
02:37:40,837 --> 02:37:42,335
Ashok.

2077
02:37:43,628 --> 02:37:46,087
We will not stay in
this place any more.

2078
02:37:46,753 --> 02:37:50,335
We'll take Chikoo, and
leave for India today.

2079
02:37:51,003 --> 02:37:52,328
Chikoo!

2080
02:37:52,418 --> 02:37:55,710
Aunt, you can't marry him
to save me!

2081
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:00,920
No.

2082
02:38:01,045 --> 02:38:02,705
I'm marrying him
with my own volition.

2083
02:38:02,795 --> 02:38:04,003
You are lying!

2084
02:38:04,128 --> 02:38:06,628
You have loved only my uncle!

2085
02:38:07,212 --> 02:38:12,795
Remember, I heeded you,
and apologised to grandma?

2086
02:38:13,878 --> 02:38:17,087
So today, you will have to heed me!

2087
02:38:18,128 --> 02:38:20,503
Don't marry him!

2088
02:38:20,837 --> 02:38:23,335
Let me die!

2089
02:38:23,503 --> 02:38:25,795
No! Please don't say that!

2090
02:38:26,003 --> 02:38:29,753
May God always bless you,
your grandma and your uncle!

2091
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:34,335
You'd said, that God
takes away with Him

2092
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:37,878
those He loves.

2093
02:38:38,753 --> 02:38:42,795
You listen to a child's lecture,
while the priest is waiting!

2094
02:38:42,962 --> 02:38:44,747
The wedding rituals are
being held up!

2095
02:38:44,837 --> 02:38:47,878
The solicitor is waiting
so we can get lucky.

2096
02:38:48,212 --> 02:38:50,580
Uncle, release this child now.

2097
02:38:50,670 --> 02:38:53,585
No! I have to get married to
this beautiful girl, first!

2098
02:38:53,962 --> 02:38:55,170
Takashi.
- Yes, sir.

2099
02:38:55,878 --> 02:38:57,295
Aunt!

2100
02:38:59,440 --> 02:39:00,940
Chikoo isn't here.
- What?

2101
02:39:01,065 --> 02:39:02,898
I'm sure those rogues are involved!

2102
02:39:03,023 --> 02:39:05,315
He is my would-be husband.
- How do you do?

2103
02:39:05,690 --> 02:39:08,732
Have you made up your
mind, Ms Asha? - Yes.

2104
02:39:09,148 --> 02:39:10,940
Congratulations! Thank you!

2105
02:39:11,065 --> 02:39:12,690
Here is your will and letter.

2106
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:14,975
Good luck and goodbye.

2107
02:39:15,065 --> 02:39:16,607
Thank you!
- Thank you!

2108
02:39:17,358 --> 02:39:19,940
Let me read.
- Why bother?

2109
02:39:20,315 --> 02:39:21,108
Allow me.

2110
02:39:37,648 --> 02:39:41,898
'Dear Asha, today must be a very
special day for Madan and you.'

2111
02:39:42,607 --> 02:39:45,605
'You must be dressed as a bride
and thanking your stars!'

2112
02:39:45,982 --> 02:39:50,233
'Madan must be so proud of
a respectful and handsome groom.'

2113
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:54,358
'Dear, I want to tell
you a secret.'

2114
02:39:54,605 --> 02:39:57,358
'Once upon a time, I knew an
immoral man. He was close to me.'

2115
02:39:58,605 --> 02:40:00,982
'He got into bad company
and ran away from home.'

2116
02:40:01,315 --> 02:40:03,607
'That unfortunate man
didn't even know'

2117
02:40:03,732 --> 02:40:06,483
'that his wife was pregnant.'

2118
02:40:06,982 --> 02:40:12,358
'She had a girl, but his wife
died grieving for her husband.'

2119
02:40:13,233 --> 02:40:14,565
'Don't mind, my dear'

2120
02:40:14,773 --> 02:40:17,607
'but, I want to give my
inheritance to that girl.'

2121
02:40:18,315 --> 02:40:20,607
'Because, she has nobody but me.'

2122
02:40:21,065 --> 02:40:23,773
'You are that fortunate girl.'

2123
02:40:24,190 --> 02:40:28,273
'And that unfortunate man
is my younger brother'

2124
02:40:28,605 --> 02:40:30,815
'and your father.'

2125
02:40:32,525 --> 02:40:33,857
'Madan.'

2126
02:40:34,315 --> 02:40:35,605
'Madan.'

2127
02:40:36,358 --> 02:40:37,398
Me?

2128
02:40:37,815 --> 02:40:39,315
Me?

2129
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:40,815
It's me!

2130
02:40:47,483 --> 02:40:48,857
My dear child!

2131
02:40:51,108 --> 02:40:52,398
My child!

2132
02:40:56,565 --> 02:41:00,605
We are running out of time.
- We have run out of time.

2133
02:41:00,982 --> 02:41:03,607
I will not let Asha get
married to this rogue!

2134
02:41:03,898 --> 02:41:06,605
What about our equal partnership?

2135
02:41:06,773 --> 02:41:08,898
This marriage will
not take place, now!

2136
02:41:09,023 --> 02:41:11,273
I will marry him, now!

2137
02:41:11,398 --> 02:41:13,440
Get ready to
give me away in marriage.

2138
02:41:13,648 --> 02:41:15,143
Priest, start the rituals!

2139
02:41:15,233 --> 02:41:16,273
My dear!

2140
02:41:16,605 --> 02:41:17,815
Do not call me your daughter!

2141
02:41:18,065 --> 02:41:19,732
The priest is eager
to do the rituals!

2142
02:41:20,148 --> 02:41:21,398
Priest, please begin
the veneration!

2143
02:41:21,565 --> 02:41:24,108
My dear! - When I was
your brother's child

2144
02:41:24,483 --> 02:41:27,315
you were getting me married
to him, for the greed of money!

2145
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:30,857
I was indeed blind!
Please, forgive me!

2146
02:41:32,065 --> 02:41:33,605
You are my only support!

2147
02:41:33,732 --> 02:41:36,108
What support do I
have in life, now?

2148
02:41:36,857 --> 02:41:39,483
You have closed
all the doors for me!

2149
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:42,815
My dear.
- I will certainly marry him.

2150
02:41:43,023 --> 02:41:44,982
I will lead a miserable life!

2151
02:41:45,148 --> 02:41:47,565
So that, you see me
and learn a lesson!

2152
02:41:47,732 --> 02:41:52,565
That all of the girls in the
nation are also your daughters!

2153
02:41:52,732 --> 02:41:53,933
Priest, please begin.

2154
02:41:54,023 --> 02:41:56,525
The old man's going mad,
because he's found his child!

2155
02:41:56,732 --> 02:41:59,065
As long as I am alive,

2156
02:41:59,358 --> 02:42:01,642
this marriage will not take place!

2157
02:42:01,732 --> 02:42:03,857
I'll have to throw you out!

2158
02:42:04,898 --> 02:42:06,440
Come on.

2159
02:42:08,982 --> 02:42:11,940
Hello, police station.

2160
02:42:38,773 --> 02:42:39,683
Chikoo!

2161
02:42:39,773 --> 02:42:40,773
Uncle.

2162
02:42:41,982 --> 02:42:43,190
Please forgive me!

2163
02:42:43,648 --> 02:42:44,982
Tell me just once that
you have forgiven me.

2164
02:42:45,108 --> 02:42:49,273
Please call me dad, my dear!

2165
02:42:49,483 --> 02:42:52,815
Say it! A father will be grateful!

2166
02:42:52,982 --> 02:42:54,605
Dad.
- My dear!

2167
02:42:54,857 --> 02:42:56,898
Stop grieving over the old man!

2168
02:42:57,023 --> 02:42:58,815
Come on, you are
going to be my wife!

2169
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:01,190
I'd rather die before
getting married to you!

2170
02:43:01,315 --> 02:43:03,358
That depends on me!

2171
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:06,148
I'll inform the police that
you have killed my father!

2172
02:43:06,273 --> 02:43:09,898
Before you can do that,
we'll leave the country!

2173
02:43:10,023 --> 02:43:12,525
Asha! My child!

2174
02:43:13,483 --> 02:43:15,898
Asha.
- Asha.

2175
02:43:16,273 --> 02:43:17,148
Asha.

2176
02:43:18,857 --> 02:43:21,023
Ashok!

2177
02:43:21,398 --> 02:43:24,525
Asha is innocent.
She is my daughter.

2178
02:43:24,648 --> 02:43:26,940
Daughter?
- Yes.

2179
02:43:27,607 --> 02:43:29,982
Pran has taken her away by force!

2180
02:43:30,315 --> 02:43:31,940
Where has he taken her?

2181
02:43:32,315 --> 02:43:34,315
Where has he taken her?

2182
02:43:35,525 --> 02:43:38,982
Where?
- To the airport!

2183
02:43:40,773 --> 02:43:42,190
Airport!

2184
02:48:38,433 --> 02:48:40,630
Ashok. Ashok.

2185
02:48:40,710 --> 02:48:41,793
Ashok!

2186
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:43,253
Let's go from here.

2187
02:48:44,752 --> 02:48:46,245
If everybody goes away,
I'll be orphaned!

2188
02:48:46,335 --> 02:48:47,627
Sir, even I'm coming!

2189
02:48:47,918 --> 02:48:51,668
"Japan!"

2190
02:48:54,253 --> 02:48:58,335
"Love in Tokyo."
