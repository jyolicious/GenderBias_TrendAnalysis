1
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:33,811
Read the back-page in Jagriti?
- Yes, and I'm wondering. . .

2
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:39,253
how the news of the mines got to the
presses despite Mr Das being in place

3
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:43,214
Got to thrash it out
at the board meeting

4
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,287
Wait

5
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:09,605
Hello, my chest is a bit of an
inconvenience for your umbrella

6
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:16,091
Where's your friend?
- My friend? Jiten. . . ?

7
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:21,533
Where is he?
- Returned to Calcutta yesterday

8
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:24,652
Came directly to the office,
after I left for the day

9
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,807
Since then, no news

10
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:31,373
Umbrella ! On my foot

11
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,089
Please hold it aloft?

12
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:47,649
Send Jiten to me as soon as he
comes to office. Understand?

13
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:50,408
Whatever you say. Bye

14
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,607
Profile, first class!

15
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,734
Front, super class!
- What. . . ?

16
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:14,685
My compliments. I'm Mr Chunilal,
chief photographer. You are. . . ?

17
00:05:17,895 --> 00:05:20,534
Ruby! Pink diamond !

18
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:25,250
What an apt name!

19
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:28,724
Pink lips, pink cheeks, pink all over

20
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,530
Since when have you been here?

21
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:40,450
Day before yesterday.
- I've been here for years

22
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:47,210
If you have any
problems here, just tell me

23
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:52,530
I got a link right
upto the managing director

24
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:59,293
Right upto the managing director?
- I meet her every evening for tea

25
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,089
The managing director

26
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:07,967
This is no time for tea

27
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,371
Great

28
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:24,491
Wake up, it's morning

29
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:29,887
The news editor has summoned you.
- Give me some time

30
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:35,333
On the double. This morning,
he's missing you dearly

31
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:38,612
What have you been upto?
- You'll get to know in a while

32
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:44,294
In a while? Why, what's to happen?
- War. Between truth and falsehood

33
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:52,724
War. . . ? No, not today, I'm in
the mood for romance. Yes dear?

34
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:55,327
This dear is cut off for now!

35
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:03,524
Are you the news editor?
- Yes

36
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:10,249
Mr Das, Seth Gulabchand says that
the story on his mines is incorrect

37
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:14,164
Absolutely incorrect, sir! I
didn't give permission to publish it

38
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:18,647
That Jiten Gupta did it.
- Who is this Jiten Gupta?

39
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:22,285
One of our reporters.
- It's his news

40
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,731
He forged my signature
and sent it to the presses

41
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,611
Forgery. . . ?

42
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:33,854
The managing director ought to
take note of the disciplinary aspect

43
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:39,854
Mr Das, you may leave.
- Fine

44
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:48,969
Madam, did we invest millions in your
newspaper to bring ourselves to harm?

45
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,930
We ought to profit. Only profit

46
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:02,094
Is this a request or a threat?

47
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:04,212
Not to misunderstand

48
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,248
A request

49
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:10,534
From this newspaper, our
businesses ought to gain. Not lose

50
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:15,447
Your involvement with the newspaper
is only in the share of profits

51
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:22,211
Deciding the policy of the newspaper,
running it, is my responsibility

52
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:25,928
And I am fully aware
of my responsibilities

53
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,603
Got to take a look at
the book before sundown

54
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:12,974
Drinking in office?
- The office being the problem. . .

55
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,649
here's right where I take care of it.
- I'll do it for you

56
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:20,251
What are you doing? ! You've
spilled half! Let me have the rest

57
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:25,455
No, I'm throwing it all away.
- Go on ! I've got money

58
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,771
That was a quarter of a bottle.
I'll buy myself a whole bottle

59
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,891
Let's see how you do that.
- Mr Gupta. . .

60
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:32,405
What is it?
- Madam wants to see Mr Gupta

61
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,045
Calling you ! For the first time!
You're surely getting a promotion

62
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:43,092
Give my money back!
- You aren't getting it back

63
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:49,006
You think I can't buy on credit?
At month's end, I drink on credit

64
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,973
Are you Jiten Gupta?
- Yes

65
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:14,250
The news about the mines is yours?
- Yes

66
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:19,329
Without permission of
the news editor? - Yes

67
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:43,448
Your job is getting the news.
Publishing is the news editor's job

68
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:47,050
I know, but. . .
- Why are you indiscipline?

69
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:50,163
For the sake of the
ideals of this newspaper

70
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,006
Isn't this our motto?
''Let the Truth prevail''

71
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:59,003
My news is correct. The mines
are in a precarious condition

72
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:04,335
They might collapse at any time.
Several miners might be killed

73
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:14,691
You shall state your case without
getting carried away. Talk business

74
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:18,729
I'm not getting carried away.
Tell me, what is more precious?

75
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:21,932
The lives of the miners?
Or office discipline?

76
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:27,969
I wish you saw for yourself
the poor miners deep underground

77
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:32,413
Sans fresh air and the
heat could melt your brains

78
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:35,529
The work conditions are stifling

79
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:41,692
You know why? If they don't
work their children will starve

80
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:45,084
Hapless as they are, they
mustn't be oppressed in this manner

81
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:49,092
What oppression?
- I have the evidence

82
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,647
The mine-owners are playing with their
lives. Just look at my photographs

83
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:58,248
Just look at the state. Ceilings,
about to cave in, flooding waters

84
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:02,045
Do take a look, madam

85
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:06,971
Why didn't you show
this to the news editor?

86
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:12,812
I did, but he refused to
publish it. I hear he's their man

87
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:16,808
Whose man?
- The mine owners'

88
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:18,084
Enough !

89
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:24,653
Mr Das has been working with us for
eight years. Not a word against him

90
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:29,091
As you please. One last thing

91
00:12:29,175 --> 00:12:33,851
I have no more time.
- The working of those mines must stop

92
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:37,449
You may leave.
- It's a matter of lives

93
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:39,685
Stop arguing.
- Give me a hearing

94
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,733
I told you. You may leave.
I wish to hear no more

95
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:46,723
Why won't you? You must.
You can, if you wish. . .

96
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:52,970
use the newspaper to save lives.
Else, today or tomorrow. . .

97
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:56,364
the mines will cave in,
crushing miners to death

98
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:59,527
Women will be widowed,
children will be orphaned

99
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,369
And you will be responsible

100
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:04,013
Silence

101
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:16,931
I hear this paper fought for
the people, for the truth. . .

102
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:22,567
in you father's times.
The daughter, I see. . .

103
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:25,324
has sold out to the capitalists

104
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:33,774
This insolence has cost you your job.
- Not my life, I hope

105
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,291
As long as I preserve my courage,
employers, there will be many

106
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:46,644
Maybe you never heard the
saying about the Eternal Spring

107
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:50,769
The arrival of The
Spring will never cease

108
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:35,372
Who else is around?
- I'm laughing it out all alone

109
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:39,444
Just read a lovely joke

110
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:48,409
I failed?

111
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,328
Complete failure

112
00:14:52,535 --> 00:14:55,447
But the results are expected tomorrow.
How come you've found out today?

113
00:14:57,615 --> 00:15:00,493
A friend told me.
- Your friend is talking rot

114
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:07,204
He works at the university.
- At the university?

115
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,734
Then. . .

116
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:17,174
What happened, Baby?
- The telephone

117
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,809
And. . .
- Conversation

118
00:15:19,895 --> 00:15:22,125
And. . . ?
- Don't you see? I'm in tears!

119
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:26,572
And why are you in tears?
- Tomorrow, Didi will scream at me

120
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:30,568
What for? I've never
heard her screaming at you

121
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:36,332
That's why I'm so sacred !
No! I can't show her my face

122
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,646
Not anymore

123
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:08,889
Would it cost you your
tongue to apologise?

124
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:10,694
Yes

125
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,725
Hear that, brother?

126
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:18,570
Take a good look at him. The
one and only, in all of India

127
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,563
As much fun as an ass has in summer. . .

128
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,613
this man enjoys going broke

129
00:16:24,695 --> 00:16:28,404
Sure.
- What do you mean? He just got fired

130
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:31,089
And look at him enjoying himself

131
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:39,564
Wonderful ! Just look at the
display of sheer nonchalance

132
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:44,531
Come off it! I'm talking to you.
- Yes, go on

133
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:47,925
Why didn't you apologise to her?
- Why should I?

134
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:56,968
Indeed ! Your father left you a legacy!
So you kick the job! Not your ego

135
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:02,003
Not ego. Ideals.
- Ideals! Indeed !

136
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:07,848
I'm talking to you.
Just look at him, brother

137
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:12,963
The world is making money.
And he's after ideals!

138
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:18,288
And why not? Money isn't as
exciting as the ideal, is it?

139
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,290
Move over

140
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:32,967
Listen, your ideals won't work,
not in 1 96 2. Not listening, are you?

141
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:37,607
You'll die starving, soon.
Let's see who gives you a job

142
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:40,210
Lots Chuni Lal, lots

143
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:54,974
''Let the gardener be gone''

144
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:59,090
''But in Eden it always blossoms''

145
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,687
''The Spring always returns''

146
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:07,734
''Spring will always return''

147
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:57,533
''Don't let yourself tire,
don't let yourself be stifled''

148
00:18:57,775 --> 00:19:01,768
''Go on, singing your tune''

149
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:14,652
''Among thorns, make
flowers blossom. . . ''

150
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:18,694
''use them to fill your emptiness''

151
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:31,327
''Let the wind fan the flames''

152
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:35,488
''Let there be venom in the air''

153
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:39,807
''Yet The Spring always returns''

154
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:43,968
''Spring will always return''

155
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:48,173
''Let the gardener be gone''

156
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:52,533
''But in Eden it always blossoms''

157
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:09,049
''What is light, what is darkness?''

158
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:13,368
''I belong to none''

159
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:30,327
''Your dreams, your desires,
are all you have''

160
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:43,452
''Let the world treat you mercilessly''

161
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,528
''Let not the climes suit you''

162
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:51,767
''Yet, The Spring always returns''

163
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:56,133
''Spring will always return''

164
00:20:56,215 --> 00:21:00,413
''Let the gardener be gone''

165
00:21:00,495 --> 00:21:04,647
''But in Eden it always blossoms''

166
00:21:58,175 --> 00:22:00,166
What are you upto?

167
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:06,774
Oh how cruel a world this is! - How
cruelly has your world dealt you?

168
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:12,248
I can't even jump when I want to die!
- Why do you wish to die?

169
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:17,131
How are you concerned? Intruding
upon someone's privacy is uncivilised

170
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:22,966
Forgive me this error.
Go on, jump. Go ahead

171
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,647
It's going to take another
three quarters of an hour

172
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:31,692
In the wait for an auspicious moment?

173
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:35,335
Worked on it for 4 5 minutes. . .

174
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:39,767
to get into the mood for the plunge.
In the nick of time, you transpire!

175
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:41,766
Ruined all my efforts!

176
00:22:43,975 --> 00:22:46,773
Then I have committed a grave crime!

177
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:53,814
Get out of this madness. Go home.
- I'm not returning

178
00:22:57,135 --> 00:22:59,251
Why is the train stopping here?

179
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:30,964
Listen. . .

180
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:40,330
Sprain?
- All because of you

181
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:43,293
Had you not meddled, I wouldn't
have had to make this getaway

182
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:49,129
Or I would've been dead by now.
- Sorry for spoiling the fun

183
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:53,084
Let me drop you home.
- I'm not going home

184
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:59,213
Then I shall, perforce.
- My foot hurts! Brute!

185
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:04,127
If you must do it like
a gentleman. Pick me up

186
00:24:07,215 --> 00:24:12,050
Don't you watch films? Are
girls picked up like this?

187
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:16,208
Yes, this is the way
every burden is carried

188
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:50,928
Is Babli asleep?
- She locked herself in all evening

189
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:54,014
Is she all right?
- Yes, you want me to wake her up?

190
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,608
No, let her sleep

191
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:04,046
You won't give me your name
and address? - No, no and no!

192
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,603
Let's see, for how long.
- Till eternity

193
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:09,368
Until then I am pursuing you

194
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,494
Look. . .

195
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:20,128
All you need is the reins

196
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,846
Step down.
- I won't

197
00:25:24,535 --> 00:25:28,130
You aren't on mule-back.
It's my back. Get off

198
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:29,533
Get off, I say

199
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:39,687
This man brought me here forcibly!
- I'm taking her home

200
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:43,370
I won't, won't and I won't!

201
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:47,733
Why are you limping?
- He gave me the limp

202
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:51,808
Your woman she won't go home with you.
So you beat her up? Aren't you ashamed?

203
00:25:53,695 --> 00:25:59,213
Why not? If women won't stay at home,
will men not raise their hands?

204
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:03,409
If men raise their hands,
will women stay at home?

205
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:08,573
You're right. Please save me.
From him. - Don't you worry, sister

206
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:12,773
He won't even point
a finger at you. Come inside

207
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:15,884
You will keep watching !

208
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:21,929
God save us from these women.
Be nice to them. . .

209
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:26,884
and they want to perch on your head.
- In my case, it has been the back

210
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,173
Who knows what is in store!

211
00:26:39,455 --> 00:26:44,051
I see. Tit for tat, eh? He
vanishes even without waking me up

212
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:51,686
When is the next train back?
- Tomorrow

213
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:58,089
Stood me up for a whole night.
Scoundrel ! I won't spare him

214
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,805
This fellow won't get up so easily

215
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,369
Can I find anything here?

216
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:21,289
Ticket, ticket!
- I got a pass. You got any problems?

217
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:25,050
Show me your pass.
- Hold this

218
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:33,329
Son of a gun !
- What did you say?

219
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:37,331
Not you brother, not you.
- You just said it

220
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:41,293
I was describing someone else.
But if that describes you. . .

221
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:46,005
well, you're a son of a gun !
- Hold your tongue, I say!

222
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:52,045
Pipe down ! You're talking to a
press photographer, do you know?

223
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:56,367
Irrespective, the fine is 2. 50.
- Pipe down, I said

224
00:27:56,455 --> 00:28:01,973
I'll pay you double. Plus a tip.
But not today, tomorrow

225
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,524
You want to bribe me? Constable!

226
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:10,166
The constable takes a cut?

227
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:15,249
Why not call in the
station master too?

228
00:28:15,335 --> 00:28:19,772
The three of you can freak out!
- No!

229
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:38,528
Hurts less. . . ?
- Vanished

230
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:43,525
What a way to treat you.
He must be cruel

231
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:46,213
Very cruel

232
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:50,533
Any children?
- Ask him

233
00:28:51,215 --> 00:28:55,845
Him. . . ? Why not you?
- How would I know how many he has?

234
00:28:56,495 --> 00:29:00,373
Goodness! Is he wayward?

235
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:04,254
Outrageous.
- Is that so?

236
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:07,008
Then he'll mend his
ways before he leaves

237
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:13,843
Are you human? Or a demon?

238
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,611
You have a woman at home.
Yet you are wayward?

239
00:29:17,775 --> 00:29:20,608
What rot are you saying?
- Shut up!

240
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:25,166
Poor thing has such bad luck to be
tied to him! I ask her, how many kids?

241
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:29,612
She says, ask my husband. Such a
demon ! Always running after girls

242
00:29:29,695 --> 00:29:33,004
She's lying ! I've got
nothing to do with her

243
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:38,089
Then why were you backpacking her?
You think you can fool me? Move

244
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:42,012
What are you doing?
- You stay back

245
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:44,563
You'll mend your ways before you leave

246
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:48,204
In you go. Apologise to your woman.
- But she isn't. . .

247
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:51,173
She has suffered enough.
Apologise to her

248
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:55,444
Go inside Bolt the door

249
00:30:00,735 --> 00:30:04,694
Why did you shut the door?
- I'm being forced. . .

250
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:11,928
to spend the night here.
- Here? With me?

251
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:17,971
Why did you tell her
we're man and woman?

252
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:22,448
Is that a lie? A man is one who
grows a beard. The rest are women

253
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:28,889
Brilliant! In local parlance,
man-woman means man and wife

254
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:41,328
Once more

255
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,454
Get lost

256
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:57,528
You're such a savage! You ought
to take a lesson from this couple

257
00:31:58,015 --> 00:32:01,451
No sooner than her man
woos her, she's willing

258
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:04,448
They love each other so much

259
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:12,366
Are you begging of your wife now?
Weren't you so brash a while ago?

260
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:54,528
Fresh news! Newspaper

261
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,931
Money
- Money. . . ? Keep it

262
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:32,650
Address. . . Siakhala

263
00:33:33,575 --> 00:33:37,614
Name. . . Chuni Lal

264
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,172
Where's Babli?
- Still asleep

265
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,565
Hasn't come out of her room yet.
- What a silly girl

266
00:34:31,614 --> 00:34:34,208
This is sleeping a bit too long

267
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:37,168
Is she all right?

268
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:43,006
Coming, Didi ( Didi = sister)

269
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,846
Hello.
- Hello

270
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:51,529
Hi Didi ! Where's Bubbles?

271
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:54,254
She has passed. In second division

272
00:34:54,735 --> 00:34:57,329
But where is she?
- Inside. Should be coming out

273
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:06,607
Yesterday, I made
such a fool of Bubbles!

274
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,129
Really?

275
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:15,091
Were you saying something, Mr Verma?
- Yes, as I was saying. . .

276
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:19,173
now that Babli has passed. . .

277
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:23,532
makes it twice as happy a day

278
00:35:25,655 --> 00:35:27,885
Bubbles isn't out yet!
Why don't you call her out?

279
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:58,690
Sushma ! You tell your
uncle to give me my wallet

280
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:01,887
Ma. . . uncles Jitu and
Chuni are at it again

281
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:03,124
Take that

282
00:36:03,215 --> 00:36:08,528
Fighting again, Chuni?
- For the last time

283
00:36:09,855 --> 00:36:14,246
Not a chance of another quarrel !
Never again will I see his face!

284
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:17,168
Never again will I talk to him!
- Don't worry, Didi

285
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:21,926
In 5 minutes, he'll start talking.
- Not in 5 lifetimes!

286
00:36:23,255 --> 00:36:27,533
Didi, you tell him not to talk
to me. Our friendship is over

287
00:36:27,815 --> 00:36:30,045
But what happened?
- What not?

288
00:36:30,135 --> 00:36:32,649
He deserted me on the train,
while I was asleep

289
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:36,444
Curse you ! You'll never land a job!

290
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,412
All night, I was
locked away in the lock-up

291
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:44,650
This morning I pawned my camera to pay
the fine! He'd rather I was in jail !

292
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:54,203
* * *Now I know why you said
I'd talk to him in 5 minutes

293
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,810
You wanted to swallow
my money! Cough it up!

294
00:36:57,895 --> 00:37:00,853
I didn't even open your wallet,
Johny. I swear it on you

295
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:03,813
Why swear on me. . . ? Find someone else!

296
00:37:03,895 --> 00:37:08,685
Nine bucks yesterday and eight today.
Where did the ninth one go?

297
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:13,694
Could she have. . . ?

298
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,570
Out with it. Fast. I got to go to work

299
00:37:16,655 --> 00:37:22,173
Didi, unlike him, I haven't been
fired. - What did you say, Chuni. . . ?

300
00:37:23,455 --> 00:37:25,764
It's true

301
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:31,404
You want me to lie to Didi?

302
00:37:38,255 --> 00:37:41,452
Stop blabbering. Here's money

303
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:50,528
Have you really lost your job?
- So what? He hasn't compromised. . .

304
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,924
on his ideals! Now he and his
ideals are going to sit at home

305
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:58,611
And so what if he gets nothing
to eat? He can live off his ideals

306
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:03,485
When will you come to your senses?
Inflation is soaring

307
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:08,330
How will we make ends meet?
- As long as I'm capable. . .

308
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:10,645
we won't starve

309
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:49,285
135 workers killed in mine collapse

310
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:56,088
You can, if you wish, use
the newspaper to save lives

311
00:38:56,535 --> 00:39:00,732
Else, today or tomorrow, the mines
will cave in, crushing miners to death

312
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:05,889
Women will be widowed,
children will be orphaned

313
00:39:05,975 --> 00:39:09,411
And you will be responsible

314
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:21,163
I hear this paper fought for
the people, for the truth. . .

315
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,372
in you father's times

316
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:28,213
The daughter, I see. . .

317
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:31,287
has sold out to the capitalists

318
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:36,128
Are you all right?

319
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:45,367
In my father's times, this newspaper
fought for the truth. Always

320
00:39:45,455 --> 00:39:50,006
I came to tell you exactly that.
135 miners killed

321
00:39:50,095 --> 00:39:54,850
It's in all the papers. Except ours

322
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:59,404
Let the Truth prevail

323
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:08,410
My father's legacy.
Reduced to mere sham? Perhaps

324
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:17,851
Going looking for a job. Bless me.
- May God give you success

325
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:38,089
Come on

326
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:42,009
Uncle Chuni ! In a grand car?
- Whose car is it?

327
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:47,764
Riding in the backseat! Door held
open by the chauffeur! Didn't you see?

328
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:49,334
Come on.
- Where to. . . ?

329
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:51,975
Let me give you a ride
on the backseat! Come on !

330
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:32,692
Oh you. . . ? One minute

331
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:36,370
It's full of dust. I haven't
been in here in a long time

332
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:42,283
A vast business is
sometimes an aberration too

333
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:46,804
How did I ever forget this place?

334
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:55,207
Looks like an ancient press office.
- Yes. Daddy's. Years ago. . .

335
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:57,092
this is where he started out from,
publishing the paper

336
00:41:57,175 --> 00:41:59,848
Really?
- This used to be Daddy's table

337
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:05,365
I've left everything as it was.
I do the cleaning and dusting myself

338
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:09,732
I don't let anyone else in here.
- Forgive me, I didn't know that

339
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:14,486
I'll wait for you in your office.
- No, for you, no bars

340
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:18,974
Don't leave
- Why have you called me?

341
00:42:22,215 --> 00:42:26,572
After the other day, I wonder
what you might be thinking of me

342
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:32,933
I'm sure it's nothing nice.
- I have no complaints against you

343
00:42:35,015 --> 00:42:36,812
Really?
- Yes

344
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:50,406
You know, there was never
anyone who dared to talk me down

345
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:55,093
For the first time,
the other day, it was you

346
00:42:57,135 --> 00:42:59,808
When I think of it, you were right

347
00:43:02,575 --> 00:43:05,372
You haven't told me
why you have called me

348
00:43:05,735 --> 00:43:12,925
I. . . this newspaper needs you.
- I too need a job

349
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:17,527
But working with your news
editor might be difficult

350
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:25,523
Mr Das has been taken off the job. In
his stead, the news editor will be. . .

351
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:30,094
you.
- I. . . ? News editor?

352
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:38,446
Yes, you. With you, my father's ideal
will flourish again. I am confident

353
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,207
Thank you

354
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,203
That was the ideal I was born into

355
00:43:47,215 --> 00:43:50,173
I feel so calm when I come here

356
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:56,089
I relive my childhood

357
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,812
As if Daddy is still here. For hours
I talk to myself, I talk to him

358
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:07,051
Talking to yourself?

359
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:12,290
Don't you tell anyone.
People will think I'm mad.

360
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:15,609
Maybe you like solitude

361
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:25,088
Solitude? Who ever likes that?
But slowly, it becomes a habit

362
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,087
The sun comes in here
quite late in the day

363
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:33,608
Better late than never

364
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,973
Mr Chuni Lal. . . hereabouts?
- Yes, come in

365
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:50,566
He lives here?
- No, over there

366
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:57,365
But he has his meals with us.
Ma, someone's here for Uncle Chuni

367
00:44:58,015 --> 00:45:02,087
You're his niece?
- Not his own

368
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:08,243
Uncle Chuni is my uncle's friend.
This is my mother

369
00:45:08,335 --> 00:45:09,609
Greetings

370
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:13,886
Greetings. Sit

371
00:45:14,535 --> 00:45:18,129
Sushma, take this inside

372
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,809
Please sit.
- Be seated

373
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:34,810
Are you from town?
- Yes. I wandered a bit

374
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:38,251
But I'm steadfast in my resolve.
I had decided not to return. . .

375
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:42,294
until I found Chuni Lal's address.
- Chuni is away in Calcutta on work

376
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:48,533
Won't be back before ten tonight.
- Ten tonight? Blast

377
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,969
Waiting that long. . .

378
00:45:52,055 --> 00:45:55,013
I'm a girl you see. Had I been a boy,
it'd be different

379
00:45:58,295 --> 00:46:00,331
What's your name?

380
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:03,805
Please be informal
with me. You are my elder

381
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,851
May I address you as my sister?
- Sure

382
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,964
Look at me Didi, I'm all grown up.
And they still call me by my pet name

383
00:46:13,055 --> 00:46:16,569
No one uses my real name!
Sunita. Isn't that a nice name?

384
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:18,725
Lovely name.
- My name's Sushma

385
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:23,650
Sushma's a lovely name too.
But Chuni Lal. . .

386
00:46:27,575 --> 00:46:29,452
You even have a guava tree?

387
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:33,767
Lovely house, Didi ! Sushma, you
must be eating raw guavas everyday!

388
00:46:34,015 --> 00:46:36,609
We only get the ripe ones.
The ones in the marketplace

389
00:46:36,695 --> 00:46:41,564
Would you like to eat guavas?
Let me get you some fresh ones

390
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:49,208
Everything's nice about
Uncle Chuni. Except one thing

391
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:55,610
He bosses over girls.
- No. He drinks

392
00:46:57,335 --> 00:47:00,566
Booze. . . ?
- You didn't know?

393
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:07,093
Don't you say I told you !
He'll twist my ears!

394
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:18,131
Didi !
- What happened?

395
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:21,930
Come here! Open your mouth !

396
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:24,654
What's this?
- Open your mouth

397
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,935
Sushma ! For you too! Take this

398
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:30,168
Gone!

399
00:47:30,735 --> 00:47:33,374
Still got the sweets. Take it

400
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:38,331
What are we celebrating?
Are you getting married?

401
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:45,093
Can any girl ever like him?
Look at this face. Vegetable

402
00:47:45,175 --> 00:47:49,453
I'm a non-vegetarian, you snake

403
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:56,534
Your brother is such a snake!
I buy sweets to celebrate his job

404
00:47:56,615 --> 00:48:00,129
Still he bites!
- Has he found a job?

405
00:48:00,215 --> 00:48:06,768
He can't even beg for a living !
My recommendation worked

406
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:11,008
Ms Sunita was here.
- Who. . . ?

407
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,252
Sunita ! What's that?

408
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,293
Stop joking. I liked her

409
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:20,447
Came looking for you this afternoon.
- A girl. . . ?

410
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:22,491
She left this letter for you

411
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:40,813
Not light enough to read

412
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:45,294
Didi, serve us dinner. I'll be back

413
00:48:57,655 --> 00:48:59,725
Vegetable

414
00:49:02,295 --> 00:49:08,211
Burn in jealousy. I got the letter

415
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:19,086
That's a fitting reply.

416
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:23,965
You'll be even more
jealous if you were to hear

417
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:30,166
She writes,
''You must be wondering. . . ''

418
00:49:30,495 --> 00:49:37,765
''how I found your address''

419
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:42,810
''7 : 30 pm tomorrow''

420
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:49,290
''At Brijwasi Sweets on Chowringhee''

421
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:52,048
''Make sure. . . ''

422
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:54,251
Sure

423
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:58,051
''Make sure you see me''

424
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:04,484
''You may not know me by name''

425
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:11,043
''I'm the one who had
a sprained ankle''

426
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,292
One with a sprained ankle?

427
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:21,652
Keep your hands to yourself.
It's a lady's letter

428
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:28,404
You see. . .

429
00:50:28,615 --> 00:50:33,973
she's as dainty as an angel,
as delicate as a blossom

430
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:37,411
The day before yesterday,
when I held her hand. . .

431
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:40,123
her wrist seemed to elude me.
- Congratulations

432
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:45,248
So you're going to see her
at 7 : 30 tomorrow evening?

433
00:51:34,415 --> 00:51:35,609
Oh, hello

434
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:39,650
Forgive me, I was engrossed

435
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:42,612
Lovely novel

436
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:46,603
Get on with it.
- Now. . . ?

437
00:51:47,135 --> 00:51:49,251
I'll keep it for later

438
00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:58,525
After you

439
00:52:03,735 --> 00:52:05,532
My name is Amita

440
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:09,654
You can call me Ms Amita,
instead of Madam

441
00:52:12,055 --> 00:52:15,013
Not on every occasion would
I like you to defer to me. . .

442
00:52:15,095 --> 00:52:20,328
for being the managing director.
- Not out of awe. I do regard you

443
00:52:22,935 --> 00:52:25,529
I see. . . ?
- Yes. I respect you a lot

444
00:52:26,615 --> 00:52:30,243
Any particular reason?

445
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:33,209
I think you're good at heart. . .

446
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:36,890
a beautiful person

447
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:41,811
Beautiful. . .
- What's on your mind?

448
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:50,450
You fancy grams?
- Sometimes I miss breakfast

449
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:55,723
Grams for breakfast?
- I just make do

450
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:58,375
Very crisp. Would you like some?

451
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,968
I think the phone's
ringing in my office

452
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:15,773
All dressed up and going to meet whom?
- No one. Just trying out the fit

453
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:18,164
Then come to the club with me.
- With you?

454
00:53:18,255 --> 00:53:21,565
You must.
- Of course I will. . . but. . .

455
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:25,970
there's a murder case
I must take some photos

456
00:53:26,895 --> 00:53:31,207
What if you're late?
- Just photographing a corpse

457
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:34,128
Readymade pose!
No posturing before the camera

458
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:38,572
Pull away the sheet and shoot.
Five minutes' job

459
00:53:38,855 --> 00:53:40,652
Let me come along too.

460
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,686
No killing looks. This is pure murder

461
00:53:46,775 --> 00:53:51,212
No place for a lady to be.
- You just said it's a 5-minute job

462
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:58,246
I'll wait outside in the cab.
- First let me find out the address

463
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:01,369
Wait here. I'll be back

464
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:12,366
You asked for me?

465
00:54:13,895 --> 00:54:15,726
Yes

466
00:54:15,935 --> 00:54:18,005
Yesterday I read your article
about the northeast situation

467
00:54:18,095 --> 00:54:21,723
You've been rather harsh.
Are you forgetting?

468
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:25,728
Government policy is
brotherhood with China

469
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:29,410
But our brethren carry knives.
Before 1 96 2 is over. . .

470
00:54:29,495 --> 00:54:33,124
they will surely do something.
- I see. . . ?

471
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:40,813
You didn't like my article, madam?
- Not madam. Amita

472
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:45,730
Tell me Ms Amita. My article. . .
- I like it

473
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:48,204
I'll have it composed for publishing.
- Wait

474
00:54:49,175 --> 00:54:53,612
Tea. . . I ordered for you too

475
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:56,050
Sit. . . be seated

476
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:06,284
Have a sandwich.
- No, thank you

477
00:55:07,055 --> 00:55:09,727
A sweet?
- I don't like sweets

478
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,812
Shall I ask for grams?

479
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:18,889
No, tea will be enough

480
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,173
Powercut

481
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:41,615
Dark, isn't it?
- Yes

482
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,849
Let me get a candle.
- Wait. . .

483
00:55:45,615 --> 00:55:52,453
I think my orderly kept
matches and a candle in this drawer

484
00:56:00,575 --> 00:56:03,134
Or is it the upper one?

485
00:56:04,935 --> 00:56:06,926
Careful

486
00:56:07,855 --> 00:56:09,527
What happened?

487
00:56:11,655 --> 00:56:13,134
Sprain?

488
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:26,846
Babli. . . ?

489
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:30,725
I called home and I find
you aren't at home yet

490
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:34,093
I'm kind of held up

491
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:37,165
With work

492
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:42,454
I would've been back by eight.
But my friend isn't here yet

493
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:47,934
Not Bela. Rosie. She was
supposed to be here by seven thirty

494
00:56:48,015 --> 00:56:50,482
Seven thirty?

495
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:53,931
7 : 30 ! Goodness!

496
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,687
What happened?
- It's past 7 : 30

497
00:56:55,775 --> 00:56:58,369
So what?
- Nothing

498
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:01,932
Got to put this in for composing.
It's getting late

499
00:57:06,295 --> 00:57:09,207
You make sure you're back home early

500
00:57:28,815 --> 00:57:31,966
Mr Gupta, wasn't Chuni with you?
- No

501
00:57:48,975 --> 00:57:52,092
She has the sprain. . .

502
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,525
What are you saying?
- Nothing

503
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:10,973
She has the sprain. . .

504
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:16,285
Hey, you know me?

505
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:18,172
Let go!

506
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:19,933
Goodness!

507
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:36,291
But you are wearing a frock

508
00:58:43,535 --> 00:58:49,644
Sunita-Sunita. . .

509
00:58:50,215 --> 00:58:53,605
Are you the one who had the sprain?
- Yes

510
00:58:54,295 --> 00:59:00,211
Glad to meet you !
Might a look enhance the pleasure?

511
00:59:00,295 --> 00:59:06,928
Show me your face, my love.
- I hear it's someone else. Ruby?

512
00:59:07,455 --> 00:59:14,486
Is she any girl? A girl is
no girl unless she's coy!

513
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:22,688
Just look at you ! Been trying forever
to take a look at you, but no go. . . ?

514
00:59:22,775 --> 00:59:28,213
Reason? You're coy. That's a girl !
And that Ruby! Imposes herself on me

515
00:59:28,295 --> 00:59:30,490
Imposes. . . ?

516
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:34,810
Perforce.
- But people say. . .

517
00:59:34,895 --> 00:59:42,654
Gossip! They malign a gentleman !
All because of Ruby! She fell for me

518
00:59:42,735 --> 00:59:47,490
Chuni Lal might be handsome.
But don't you stop being coy

519
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:52,325
Chuni darling ! My ears are
sick of hearing Chuni-darlings

520
00:59:52,415 --> 00:59:54,849
And what a horrible voice!

521
01:00:22,735 --> 01:00:25,169
So this is the set-up

522
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:26,654
But who is she?

523
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:45,452
My cheek!

524
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:50,091
Blood ! Hospital !

525
01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:57,003
Stop staring. Ask me why
I called you. - What for?

526
01:00:57,855 --> 01:01:01,245
Here. To return your money.
- For only this?

527
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:02,763
Only

528
01:01:05,055 --> 01:01:07,888
May I stop the cab and get off?

529
01:01:10,455 --> 01:01:12,093
Am I to leave now?

530
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,689
Sure

531
01:01:21,495 --> 01:01:24,248
What happened?
- How are you concerned?

532
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:30,005
You want to leave? Just go on.
- But why are you in tears?

533
01:01:30,415 --> 01:01:34,294
Crying over my foolishness!
I should've posted you the money

534
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:36,606
Why did I have to scour your
village in the midsummer sun?

535
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:40,973
I could've left the money there
for you. Why did I leave a note?

536
01:01:41,055 --> 01:01:45,207
Why did I call you here and wait
for you so long? Why, why and why?

537
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,929
Worth wondering. Why?

538
01:01:50,175 --> 01:01:51,449
Perhaps. . .

539
01:01:52,695 --> 01:01:56,370
Goodness! Could I be. . .

540
01:01:57,175 --> 01:01:59,086
in that with you?
- That. . . ?

541
01:02:00,895 --> 01:02:06,049
Love!
- Looks somewhat like that

542
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:08,128
No!

543
01:02:13,415 --> 01:02:18,853
Bela is in love with someone.
She says, when he touches her. . .

544
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:24,166
her whole body is electrified.
Touch me

545
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:28,055
Happened?
- Nothing

546
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:30,934
Thank your stars!
You're saved ! Else. . .

547
01:02:49,815 --> 01:02:52,727
This time. . . something happened?

548
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,327
Stop

549
01:03:31,335 --> 01:03:35,806
Don't stare
- I will. Even in my dreams

550
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,929
I'm in a fix.
- Why?

551
01:03:45,135 --> 01:03:48,093
Because you're a drunkard.
How will I face the world?

552
01:03:49,495 --> 01:03:53,328
I'm neither a drunk, nor Chuni Lal.
- Then. . . ?

553
01:03:53,415 --> 01:03:57,328
My name's Jitendra.
- Sushma's uncle?

554
01:03:57,415 --> 01:04:00,532
Yes. Surely you can face
the whole world on that?

555
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:36,805
''Tell the world. . . ''

556
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:38,966
''I fell in love. . . ''

557
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:42,327
''because I was scared''

558
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:47,052
''Alas, I am in love''

559
01:05:19,855 --> 01:05:23,325
''Let the world be jealous''

560
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:25,765
''Our story is written''

561
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:29,165
''We won't be afraid''

562
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:34,683
''Hearts we have traded of love''

563
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:36,925
''Why should we be afraid?''

564
01:05:37,015 --> 01:05:42,567
''Oh, my heart skips a beat''

565
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:47,326
''Alas, I am in love''

566
01:05:48,855 --> 01:05:54,725
''Tell the world. . . ''

567
01:05:55,055 --> 01:05:57,205
''I fell in love. . . ''

568
01:05:57,295 --> 01:06:00,526
''because I was scared''

569
01:06:00,775 --> 01:06:04,768
''Alas, I am in love''

570
01:06:20,655 --> 01:06:24,284
''Let's paint the town red''

571
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,570
''Let's show the world. . . ''

572
01:06:26,735 --> 01:06:30,250
''the magic of love''

573
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:35,609
''Hearts speak. . . ''

574
01:06:35,695 --> 01:06:37,890
''flowers blossom. . . ''

575
01:06:37,975 --> 01:06:40,330
''in a world anew''

576
01:06:40,415 --> 01:06:43,566
''What I've done, I had to do''

577
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:48,007
''Alas, I am in love''

578
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:55,651
''Tell the world. . . ''

579
01:06:55,735 --> 01:06:58,044
''I fell in love. . . ''

580
01:06:58,135 --> 01:07:01,445
''because I was scared''

581
01:07:01,815 --> 01:07:06,047
''Alas, I am in love''

582
01:07:27,575 --> 01:07:29,087
Who's that?

583
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:33,009
Where's Jitu?
- Don't even mention him!

584
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:37,045
Why are you looking away? Turn around

585
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:40,013
It's sultry

586
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:45,330
And the breeze is blowing this way

587
01:07:45,415 --> 01:07:50,535
And these long plantain
leaves swaying in the breeze

588
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,605
Ma, look at this

589
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:01,931
What are those three
lines on your cheek?

590
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:10,170
You see, I revere these godmen.

591
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:14,885
Today, I met one on the way

592
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:18,212
One of those who say ''Alakh Niranjan''

593
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:20,126
He was walking

594
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:25,568
I stooped to touch his feet,
but he got it wrong

595
01:08:25,814 --> 01:08:28,647
He lunged at me with his trident.
Lucky for me, I took it on the cheek

596
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:30,929
Could've been the eye. . .

597
01:08:32,335 --> 01:08:36,010
It wasn't a godman. He was
about to fall at a woman's feet

598
01:08:36,095 --> 01:08:39,929
Don't you force me to open my mouth.
I'll use my foulest, in front of Didi

599
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,575
Fighting again?
- He, not I

600
01:08:42,654 --> 01:08:47,011
Snake! He's trying to malign me!
The whole world knows. . .

601
01:08:47,095 --> 01:08:53,694
Chuni Lal won't even let a female get
close. And he tells her I'm a Casanova

602
01:08:53,774 --> 01:08:56,163
Whom?
- Sunita

603
01:08:56,455 --> 01:08:59,127
To become Chuni Lal,
you got to be born again

604
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:04,812
The very name bowled her over!
But how do I face the world?

605
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:10,970
They'll say, Chuni Lal is
after girls! I should drown myself

606
01:09:11,135 --> 01:09:12,807
Not even in my dreams will
I ever see your face!

607
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:16,524
If ever, I'll wake myself up

608
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:20,050
End of the friendship! Out of my way!

609
01:09:21,455 --> 01:09:25,448
Let him be, Didi.
He'll be fine tomorrow

610
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:29,492
Yes. . . ?
- Sunita came to see you?

611
01:09:30,095 --> 01:09:33,212
I liked Sunita very much.
When is she coming again?

612
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:35,091
Go and play

613
01:09:51,495 --> 01:09:58,606
Lofty ideal. And I swear by it.
I always lend the other cheek

614
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:02,491
At your service

615
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:08,369
If you have any anger left,
you can take it out on this cheek

616
01:10:09,215 --> 01:10:11,775
Come on, Ruby.
- Don't you dare Ruby me

617
01:10:11,855 --> 01:10:15,325
Will it be the surname, Ms Chatterjee?

618
01:10:21,215 --> 01:10:23,126
Let's go
- Listen. . .

619
01:10:38,415 --> 01:10:44,934
''Calcutta girls don't get angry.
This matter is no better''

620
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:52,570
''Listen Ms Chatterjee,
this is a matter of my heart''

621
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:50,527
''All dressed up and
going somewhere at 50 mph?''

622
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:57,133
''Don't you make romantic
souls jump out of running cars''

623
01:12:08,535 --> 01:12:14,690
''On your way out, read
my heart's open letter''

624
01:12:41,055 --> 01:12:45,367
''Tear up that letter in your heart''

625
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:49,209
''You think you can make a fool of me?''

626
01:12:58,295 --> 01:13:02,527
''You swore you love me''

627
01:13:02,615 --> 01:13:06,494
''And you go fishing?''

628
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:12,089
''You tell me now, what is the matter?''

629
01:13:53,415 --> 01:13:57,852
''Don't you try to evade me''

630
01:13:59,975 --> 01:14:04,685
''I'll strangle
myself on your red veil''

631
01:14:15,655 --> 01:14:21,844
''But before I die, I'll
write a letter to the government''

632
01:14:59,015 --> 01:15:01,404
Be seated. I'll inform the lady

633
01:15:29,935 --> 01:15:31,414
You. . . ?

634
01:15:36,335 --> 01:15:38,291
Here on business. . . ?

635
01:15:39,415 --> 01:15:41,485
No, I was just. . .

636
01:15:41,655 --> 01:15:46,045
Working on a holiday? Or
did you want to see me?

637
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,965
I didn't know you live here.
- Then what brings you here?

638
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:52,568
Didi. . .

639
01:15:54,615 --> 01:15:57,129
She's like a tempest!

640
01:15:57,495 --> 01:16:00,487
This is my naughty sister, Babli

641
01:16:00,575 --> 01:16:03,532
Our news editor, Mr Gupta

642
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,526
Never seen him before. . .
- How could you. . . ?

643
01:16:09,615 --> 01:16:12,492
He's here for the first time

644
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,809
Please. . . be seated

645
01:16:24,015 --> 01:16:26,927
Yes, you never told me,
what brings you here. . .

646
01:16:27,455 --> 01:16:28,934
I. . .

647
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:32,166
It's so hot today

648
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:39,525
Visiting one of our neighbours?
- Yes. A friend

649
01:16:39,615 --> 01:16:43,210
I was looking for his address
when I found out that you live here

650
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:46,924
I. . . ?
- No, your sister

651
01:16:47,695 --> 01:16:53,246
So you wanted to see my sister?
My sister's such a darling, no. . . ?

652
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:59,809
Some tea for you?
- No thanks

653
01:17:00,895 --> 01:17:05,923
Mr Gupta, how many children have you?

654
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:13,685
Have you. . . ?
- No. Not married yet

655
01:17:15,895 --> 01:17:18,967
You don't like the idea of marrying?

656
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:24,490
Didn't. Until lately that is

657
01:17:25,535 --> 01:17:27,366
Have you chosen a girl for yourself?

658
01:17:30,015 --> 01:17:35,851
Next, you will surely ask
who it is? I don't mind saying

659
01:17:36,655 --> 01:17:41,968
Weren't you playing the piano?
- En passant

660
01:17:42,895 --> 01:17:48,367
En passant? Playing the
piano isn't easy, is it?

661
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:53,366
She thinks no one can play it better
than she does. You teach her a lesson

662
01:17:54,455 --> 01:17:56,411
He'll play the piano?

663
01:17:58,935 --> 01:18:00,732
Let me try

664
01:18:42,495 --> 01:18:49,412
''I see your face in a new light''

665
01:18:49,815 --> 01:18:56,846
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

666
01:18:57,335 --> 01:19:04,332
''Your eyes must be saying something?''

667
01:19:04,695 --> 01:19:11,294
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

668
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:44,924
''The beauty amidst dark tresses''

669
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:52,444
''Like the morning sunshine
filtering through clouds''

670
01:19:52,535 --> 01:19:59,805
''Wherever you look. . . ''

671
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:07,683
''Wherever you cast a look,
it's intoxication all the way''

672
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:15,051
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

673
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:22,851
''I see your face in a new light''

674
01:20:23,095 --> 01:20:30,331
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

675
01:20:56,895 --> 01:21:04,370
''Downcast eyes, so
dangerously enticing''

676
01:21:04,695 --> 01:21:12,009
''In hidden smiles,
there lurks lightning''

677
01:21:12,255 --> 01:21:19,525
''Your beauty. . . ''

678
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:27,523
''Your beauty intoxicates you''

679
01:21:27,855 --> 01:21:34,965
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

680
01:21:35,335 --> 01:21:42,605
''Your eyes must be saying something?''

681
01:21:42,855 --> 01:21:50,125
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

682
01:22:16,855 --> 01:22:24,205
''At your every footfall,
the seasons change. . . ''

683
01:22:24,415 --> 01:22:31,730
''as if The Eternal
Spring flows forth from you''

684
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:38,574
''Who else is as attractive. . . ?''

685
01:22:39,575 --> 01:22:47,289
''Who could be as charming as you are''

686
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:54,651
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

687
01:22:55,095 --> 01:23:02,410
''I see your face in a new light''

688
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:09,686
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

689
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:17,485
''Your eyes must be saying something?''

690
01:23:17,695 --> 01:23:25,009
''If I'm swayed, am I at fault?''

691
01:23:43,735 --> 01:23:46,885
Not just the music. A lot of
heart went into that song. For whom?

692
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:50,571
For you. . . ?

693
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:58,964
May I leave now, Ms Amita?
- Today's a holiday. Leave after lunch

694
01:23:59,055 --> 01:24:02,730
Thanks, some other time. As I told you,
I have an appointment with a friend

695
01:24:02,815 --> 01:24:04,931
I'm rather late. Bye

696
01:24:07,535 --> 01:24:12,005
Wait. . . let the car drop you.
- I'll tell the chauffeur

697
01:24:19,215 --> 01:24:24,130
Who was this?
- Mr Jitendra Gupta

698
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:34,931
The Chinese have attacked.
Buy up everything

699
01:24:35,335 --> 01:24:37,849
We'll sell
everything on the black-market

700
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:44,093
Only if the war deepens. In
the last war, we made millions

701
01:24:44,815 --> 01:24:47,169
This time, we'll make tenfold

702
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:50,691
Sunita, you might've
heard of the Chinese attack

703
01:24:50,775 --> 01:24:53,242
I'm leaving for Tejpur?
- Tejpur. . . ?

704
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:57,044
Yes Tejpur. If I get permission,
I'll go right to the front

705
01:24:57,335 --> 01:25:00,930
No! You can't go there.
Send someone else

706
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:03,934
I told the editor, I'm going myself

707
01:25:04,855 --> 01:25:08,210
Nearly time for the flight.
I won't be able to see you

708
01:25:08,295 --> 01:25:11,731
I'll see you when I get back.
- No! I'm not letting you go

709
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:18,565
What's up? Why are you so disturbed?
- You know Didi. . .

710
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:22,530
Don't you leave without seeing me.
- Who's going? Where?

711
01:25:23,855 --> 01:25:28,485
Friend of mine. Leaving Calcutta.
I must see her

712
01:25:32,815 --> 01:25:35,204
What's come over you? Take the call

713
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:40,449
One minute

714
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,173
For you

715
01:25:46,495 --> 01:25:48,644
Yes Mr Shukla

716
01:25:51,495 --> 01:25:54,931
What did you say? Mr Gupta is going?

717
01:25:55,695 --> 01:25:59,324
No! How did you take such a
big decision without my say-so?

718
01:25:59,415 --> 01:26:03,374
I tried to convince Mr
Gupta about sending a reporter

719
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:07,004
But he said he was sure,
you'd let him go

720
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:11,930
Never! I mean, stop him.
I'll come and decide who goes

721
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:25,923
Chini Lal? Not Chini Lal. Chuni Lal

722
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:31,772
Chuni Lal has ''chini''
( sugar) every morning with tea

723
01:26:35,295 --> 01:26:39,413
Not even a smile? Fought
with your wife this morning?

724
01:26:48,695 --> 01:26:52,210
Where's Mr Gupta?
- I went to stop him. . .

725
01:26:52,295 --> 01:26:54,286
as soon as you told me.
- And. . . ?

726
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,684
But. . .
- Where is he?

727
01:26:56,775 --> 01:26:59,687
He had left already.
- Left already?

728
01:26:59,775 --> 01:27:05,644
You know how important his presence
is for me. . . for the newspaper

729
01:27:06,575 --> 01:27:09,452
Why did you give him the
chance to endanger his life?

730
01:27:09,935 --> 01:27:12,574
Don't leave! Please! Stay,
for my sake!

731
01:27:13,455 --> 01:27:17,050
Or tell me you don't love me.
- I do

732
01:27:18,055 --> 01:27:21,172
But I also love my
country and my profession

733
01:27:21,255 --> 01:27:24,884
The Army is there to save
the country. Why are you going?

734
01:27:24,975 --> 01:27:30,766
To tell my countrymen how
bravely they fight the enemy

735
01:27:31,455 --> 01:27:35,242
After all it's for us
that the Army is fighting

736
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:39,169
Until we back our Army to the last,
our independence is at stake

737
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:46,213
That maybe so. But my
heart doesn't permit me. . .

738
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:51,649
Silly! Nothing's going to happen
to me. Send me away with a smile

739
01:28:55,534 --> 01:29:02,451
''With a smile he greeted me''

740
01:29:02,934 --> 01:29:08,850
''I thought it was love''

741
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:15,169
''Oh so mistaken I was''

742
01:29:15,254 --> 01:29:21,284
''I thought it was an
expression of amour''

743
01:29:46,254 --> 01:29:52,409
''I wasn't destined to have someone. . .

744
01:29:52,494 --> 01:29:58,250
''I could call my own''

745
01:30:23,414 --> 01:30:29,125
''Oh why did I think. . . ''

746
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:35,285
''I deserve love?''

747
01:31:00,214 --> 01:31:06,210
''Oh how can I weep?''

748
01:31:06,454 --> 01:31:12,643
''Oh how do I speak?''

749
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:43,404
''I'm afraid. . . ''

750
01:31:43,694 --> 01:31:49,564
''for the conclusion
the world might jump to''

751
01:31:50,014 --> 01:31:55,805
''I was mistaken. . . ''

752
01:31:56,294 --> 01:32:02,050
''I thought it was an
expression of amour''

753
01:32:02,294 --> 01:32:07,925
''With a smile he greeted me''

754
01:32:08,214 --> 01:32:14,369
''I thought it was love''

755
01:32:29,854 --> 01:32:33,927
What is the matter Didi? Your eyes. . .
- No, it's nothing of the sort

756
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:40,928
My eyes are a bit fatigued

757
01:32:43,294 --> 01:32:48,652
Another sleepless night?
- I'm anxious, Didi

758
01:32:50,334 --> 01:32:55,727
Anxiety? Because of the war?
- Are you anxious too?

759
01:32:55,814 --> 01:32:58,931
Me. . . ? Well. . .

760
01:32:59,734 --> 01:33:01,406
Tell me

761
01:33:03,334 --> 01:33:06,849
Everyone's anxious, Babli.
Go to sleep

762
01:33:08,854 --> 01:33:12,688
I'm so anxious,
Didi ! Oh I'm so anxious

763
01:33:13,574 --> 01:33:17,009
You don't know who might die!
- What are you saying?

764
01:33:17,094 --> 01:33:20,769
Silly! Don't bring these
things to your mind. Don't!

765
01:33:20,854 --> 01:33:23,732
Didi, why are you so worked up?

766
01:33:25,294 --> 01:33:30,971
I. . . For your sake,
Babli. You were in tears

767
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:36,842
I hate wars. It makes me cry.

768
01:33:38,214 --> 01:33:41,206
Tears sometimes are a blessing

769
01:33:42,094 --> 01:33:44,369
What do I do?

770
01:33:44,814 --> 01:33:51,287
I can't cry, I can't laugh.
Go to sleep

771
01:34:11,334 --> 01:34:15,849
Captain, I hear this
bridge was built only last year

772
01:34:16,574 --> 01:34:18,212
How come it has collapsed so soon?

773
01:34:18,294 --> 01:34:22,048
Under the weight of
refugees crossing

774
01:34:24,334 --> 01:34:29,692
An incident like this in times of
war? Could it be a traitor's work?

775
01:34:29,774 --> 01:34:35,963
Traitors are what we should call them.
Those who built it, used bad cement

776
01:34:37,574 --> 01:34:39,690
Adulterated cement?

777
01:34:40,894 --> 01:34:46,810
I must expose those who
have betrayed the country

778
01:35:12,094 --> 01:35:13,447
Read that?

779
01:35:15,494 --> 01:35:18,133
And it's our
newspaper that publishes it

780
01:35:19,174 --> 01:35:22,484
Must be mere suspicion.
How can they find evidence?

781
01:35:22,574 --> 01:35:27,364
That fool Jitendra Gupta is out there.
He might've unearthed some evidence

782
01:35:31,214 --> 01:35:34,843
I have the key to his silence

783
01:35:35,454 --> 01:35:40,244
News from Tejpur brings hope.
Our forces have put up. . .

784
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:43,053
a determined resistance
against the Chinese aggressors. . .

785
01:35:43,134 --> 01:35:47,446
forcing the Chinese
into retreat at Tejpur

786
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,445
A ceasefire has been announced

787
01:35:49,614 --> 01:35:52,253
Hello Didi.
- Hello Ms Amita

788
01:35:53,654 --> 01:35:59,411
You know, the Chinese are in retreat!
They didn't reach Tejpur

789
01:35:59,494 --> 01:36:02,724
That's great news!
- Great news!

790
01:36:03,374 --> 01:36:07,969
I can't tell you
what great news this is!

791
01:36:09,374 --> 01:36:11,808
She's so happy! This is your chance!

792
01:36:11,894 --> 01:36:14,249
Say it. Shoot
- Shut up

793
01:36:16,254 --> 01:36:19,212
Did you say something?
- No.

794
01:36:19,294 --> 01:36:21,364
Why don't you say it?
- What is the matter?

795
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:28,326
Bikram has been
pestering me to tell you that. . .

796
01:36:28,414 --> 01:36:31,929
You won't ever say it! Let me say it

797
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:35,173
Didi, I want to marry Babli

798
01:36:37,614 --> 01:36:39,172
What. . . ?

799
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:44,727
No, you can't marry Babli

800
01:36:45,534 --> 01:36:47,125
Why not?

801
01:36:47,974 --> 01:36:52,525
I thought you loved me like a
brother. - That may be so. But. . .

802
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:58,728
I want to see Babli happy.
- Babli will be very happy with me

803
01:36:58,814 --> 01:37:02,284
I'm certain !
- No, you are mistaken

804
01:37:04,094 --> 01:37:07,928
How come. . . ?
- Is she in love with someone else?

805
01:37:09,574 --> 01:37:14,409
No. . . she has told me nothing.
- Then you know something?

806
01:37:14,854 --> 01:37:16,845
Is there anyone else in her life?

807
01:37:16,934 --> 01:37:20,483
Didi, I want to listen to the radio

808
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:25,649
Your sister was saying. . .
- Never mind. Go on

809
01:37:35,014 --> 01:37:39,644
We could've found out from her.
Why did you send her away?

810
01:37:40,494 --> 01:37:44,726
I don't think I'm answerable to you.
All I'm telling you is. . .

811
01:37:45,774 --> 01:37:49,244
as long as I'm alive, you
won't marry Babli. Never

812
01:37:50,254 --> 01:37:55,692
I know why! You don't want
your sister to be loved.

813
01:37:55,894 --> 01:37:59,682
Because, for yourself you
haven't had a man's love

814
01:38:01,614 --> 01:38:04,128
I apologise on his behalf

815
01:38:04,214 --> 01:38:06,648
Fool ! Get out of here

816
01:38:16,134 --> 01:38:20,764
You haven't had a man's love

817
01:38:30,574 --> 01:38:32,690
Hello Ms Amita

818
01:38:39,294 --> 01:38:43,889
You might be surprised
seeing me here. I've just returned

819
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:46,773
Be seated

820
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:57,011
My suspicions about the
bridge turns out to be true

821
01:38:57,094 --> 01:39:01,451
I've found the evidence.
I want to do a series of articles

822
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,930
Do that

823
01:39:04,014 --> 01:39:09,134
Think it over, Ms Amita. The person
who supplied adulterated cement. . .

824
01:39:09,214 --> 01:39:12,172
is your partner in the paper

825
01:39:14,774 --> 01:39:17,925
I have no partners

826
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:21,973
For the sake of the truth,
publish whatever you want

827
01:39:23,294 --> 01:39:24,773
I'm with you

828
01:39:31,214 --> 01:39:34,092
I mean Mr Gupta, when
did you return from Tejpur?

829
01:39:34,174 --> 01:39:35,607
Today

830
01:39:37,374 --> 01:39:42,402
Didi. . . I knew he went there.
Now who told me. . . ?

831
01:39:42,974 --> 01:39:47,889
Who else? I might've been the one?

832
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,686
Yes Didi ! You were the one

833
01:39:52,334 --> 01:39:56,043
Sit
- What a lovely day!

834
01:39:56,534 --> 01:39:58,411
Lovely weather

835
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:01,005
Isn't that so, Mr Gupta?
- Oh yes

836
01:40:02,134 --> 01:40:04,090
Beautiful weather

837
01:40:04,174 --> 01:40:07,962
Let's go out somewhere,
Didi ! Oh, but how can you?

838
01:40:08,054 --> 01:40:14,402
You got to go to the office. Mr Gupta,
my sister likes nothing but work

839
01:40:17,014 --> 01:40:22,407
Liking anything else is no good,
Babli. One ends up a loser

840
01:40:23,614 --> 01:40:27,447
Go on, take a day out.
- I'll leave after lunch

841
01:40:27,694 --> 01:40:29,685
But where. . . ?

842
01:40:31,094 --> 01:40:33,562
Where should I go, Mr Gupta?

843
01:40:33,654 --> 01:40:37,772
Wherever you feel like.
- Just go somewhere

844
01:40:39,814 --> 01:40:44,524
Mr Gupta, you must be tired.
You can join office from tomorrow

845
01:40:46,094 --> 01:40:48,005
The fish ! Brilliant!

846
01:40:48,294 --> 01:40:50,888
I love gazing at fish

847
01:40:51,094 --> 01:40:55,531
The lake at botanical gardens is full
of fish. I'm going there after lunch

848
01:41:08,574 --> 01:41:16,571
''At heart I was always ecstatic''

849
01:41:17,054 --> 01:41:25,007
''You've added to it a dash of madness''

850
01:41:58,854 --> 01:42:06,363
''There's a bit of
craziness in our age''

851
01:42:07,134 --> 01:42:14,893
''And some of it, because we're young''

852
01:42:19,694 --> 01:42:27,612
''And it puts a fire in our my breath''

853
01:42:28,134 --> 01:42:36,132
''And you've added to
it a dash of madness''

854
01:42:53,054 --> 01:43:00,369
''True, at this moment,
I'm not in my senses''

855
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:09,048
''In the ecstasy,
I might swoon in your arms''

856
01:43:17,974 --> 01:43:26,052
''Those eyes have devoured me''

857
01:43:26,374 --> 01:43:34,644
''At heart I was always ecstatic''

858
01:43:42,934 --> 01:43:50,966
''These dancing tresses,
this fiery beauty''

859
01:43:59,574 --> 01:44:07,491
''Oh stop yourself, please''

860
01:44:12,174 --> 01:44:20,127
''My emotions are caught in a storm''

861
01:44:20,614 --> 01:44:28,248
''You've added to it a dash of madness''

862
01:44:28,934 --> 01:44:36,887
''At heart I was always ecstatic''

863
01:44:44,974 --> 01:44:46,248
Welcome

864
01:44:46,334 --> 01:44:50,964
Forgive me for interrupting.
- I have the whole day ahead

865
01:44:51,054 --> 01:44:54,091
This article has to
be in by this evening

866
01:44:55,214 --> 01:44:59,253
About the cement factory?
- Yes, please have a seat

867
01:44:59,334 --> 01:45:01,563
No thanks, I got to get back early

868
01:45:03,414 --> 01:45:07,326
Early this morning, the owners of
the cement factory paid me a visit

869
01:45:09,254 --> 01:45:12,326
They want me to ask Ms
Amita to have you fired

870
01:45:15,774 --> 01:45:18,652
Then you should've
gone to Ms Amita directly

871
01:45:21,574 --> 01:45:25,361
How I wish you understood me
as well as I understand you

872
01:45:26,094 --> 01:45:31,043
I come in hope. Hoping that you will
never do a disservice to Ms Amita

873
01:45:31,494 --> 01:45:34,884
How can she get hurt?

874
01:45:36,334 --> 01:45:39,565
This newspaper earlier operated
from the small building next door

875
01:45:40,694 --> 01:45:45,051
This new building, all
this new machinery. . .

876
01:45:45,334 --> 01:45:49,566
the rise of this newspaper is
all by dint of Ms Amita's efforts

877
01:45:50,294 --> 01:45:53,206
For which, she has had
to borrow in millions

878
01:45:53,374 --> 01:45:57,606
From whom?
- The very men who want you out

879
01:45:57,694 --> 01:46:00,049
Ms Amita's entire
shareholding is mortgaged to them

880
01:46:00,134 --> 01:46:01,965
And the term of the
loan is running out

881
01:46:02,454 --> 01:46:08,005
So if they want, they
can also throw Ms Amita out

882
01:46:08,094 --> 01:46:11,643
I came to tell you just that.
I leave the decision to you

883
01:46:12,694 --> 01:46:17,210
I am sure whatever you
do will be for the best

884
01:46:28,174 --> 01:46:31,564
No! Mr Gupta doesn't leave!

885
01:46:32,654 --> 01:46:37,250
Is this your final decision?
- Absolutely

886
01:46:44,134 --> 01:46:47,683
Forgive us, we have troubled you

887
01:46:59,174 --> 01:47:02,849
You're making a grave mistake

888
01:47:04,094 --> 01:47:08,406
The paper shouldn't pass
into their hands, come what may

889
01:47:08,934 --> 01:47:13,246
You want me to accept their dictate?

890
01:47:13,334 --> 01:47:16,291
What option is there?

891
01:47:16,374 --> 01:47:18,808
You say, your entire
stock is mortgaged to them

892
01:47:18,894 --> 01:47:22,011
I'm not going to be threatened !

893
01:47:22,094 --> 01:47:26,485
As long as I am, Mr Gupta stays

894
01:47:26,934 --> 01:47:32,725
For how long? If they wish,
they can have you thrown out

895
01:47:32,814 --> 01:47:35,203
Will Mr Gupta be able
to survive afterwards?

896
01:47:35,294 --> 01:47:39,684
Come what may, he will leave. Why
should you leave your newspaper?

897
01:47:39,774 --> 01:47:46,009
But how can I throw out
someone who is innocent? Never!

898
01:47:46,614 --> 01:47:52,052
Must you be so adamant? In your
life this newspaper meant everything !

899
01:47:52,134 --> 01:47:54,250
Today, you don't care?

900
01:47:55,254 --> 01:47:57,404
Does Mr Gupta mean more to you?

901
01:47:57,734 --> 01:48:00,646
Give me an answer!
For the sake of what. . .

902
01:48:00,734 --> 01:48:04,170
are you determined to ruin your
newspaper, your future, your life?

903
01:48:04,454 --> 01:48:06,763
Why can't you fire Mr Gupta?

904
01:48:07,654 --> 01:48:12,933
I won't! I won't fire him!

905
01:48:15,054 --> 01:48:19,013
Why, I ask you ! What reason
is it that's stopping you?

906
01:48:19,094 --> 01:48:22,166
What comes over you at the
mention that he might have to leave?

907
01:48:23,174 --> 01:48:27,452
Could it be that you have
a soft corner for Mr Gupta?

908
01:48:33,054 --> 01:48:39,004
Then my suspicion is true.
You are in love with Mr Gupta

909
01:49:21,694 --> 01:49:28,167
They want to throw you out! Just let
them try! We'll raze this building !

910
01:49:28,934 --> 01:49:32,006
Oh but this is all stone. . .
we'll raze it nevertheless

911
01:49:32,094 --> 01:49:35,973
We'll go on strike, red flags and all !

912
01:49:36,054 --> 01:49:39,330
One of the union leaders
shares a tipple with me

913
01:49:39,414 --> 01:49:42,371
All I got to do is ply him some,
and we have a blockade

914
01:49:42,454 --> 01:49:44,683
Madam is in her office

915
01:49:46,534 --> 01:49:49,001
Where are you going? Listen. . .

916
01:49:50,534 --> 01:49:54,924
I'm no Chuni Lal unless I
fix each and everyone of them

917
01:49:55,014 --> 01:50:01,203
I'll take a photo his folks won't
recognise, forget his neighbours!

918
01:50:05,894 --> 01:50:07,293
Ms Amita. . .

919
01:50:16,934 --> 01:50:19,812
What's this?
- My resignation

920
01:50:22,494 --> 01:50:24,212
Resignation?

921
01:50:24,454 --> 01:50:30,483
Yes. I'm quitting.
- Why?

922
01:50:31,374 --> 01:50:34,605
Till yesterday, you were happy here.
Why, all of a sudden. . . ?

923
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:40,007
Nothing. I just want to leave.
- Tell me the truth

924
01:50:40,454 --> 01:50:45,130
Has the cement lobby threatened you?
Are you doing this for me?

925
01:50:45,814 --> 01:50:50,763
For the newspaper. More than me,
this newspaper needs you

926
01:50:50,854 --> 01:50:52,287
But. . .

927
01:50:55,374 --> 01:50:57,490
I can't run this paper all alone

928
01:50:58,214 --> 01:51:02,001
You aren't leaving.
- Please appoint another news editor

929
01:51:02,374 --> 01:51:06,844
Why get into trouble for my sake?
Please, let me leave

930
01:51:08,414 --> 01:51:14,933
You are being uselessly stubborn.
Take your resignation back

931
01:51:15,734 --> 01:51:21,730
I'm helpless, Ms Amita. My ego
won't let me work here anymore

932
01:51:21,814 --> 01:51:25,648
All you care for is your own ego?
What about someone else?

933
01:51:29,494 --> 01:51:32,929
The managing director's
words hold no meaning for you?

934
01:51:33,014 --> 01:51:37,690
I don't get any of this. My departure
will help keep your newspaper afloat

935
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,765
What else is your problem?
- Don't trouble me anymore!

936
01:51:39,854 --> 01:51:43,369
For God's sake! I don't accept
your resignation ! You aren't leaving

937
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:49,883
You aren't and you aren't!
- Irrespective, I'm leaving

938
01:52:22,414 --> 01:52:26,532
Are you going somewhere?
- Yes

939
01:52:29,414 --> 01:52:31,132
At night. . . ?

940
01:52:32,374 --> 01:52:33,523
Where?

941
01:52:36,254 --> 01:52:38,131
I'm leaving this house

942
01:52:45,494 --> 01:52:48,611
Come off it! Give me that suitcase.
- No Didi

943
01:52:49,654 --> 01:52:51,167
No. . . ?

944
01:52:51,654 --> 01:52:56,125
You won't obey your sister?
- No! I've always been afraid of you

945
01:52:56,214 --> 01:52:59,047
But you don't scare
me anymore! Get that?

946
01:53:02,174 --> 01:53:07,043
What's all this happening?

947
01:53:09,494 --> 01:53:12,531
Why are you misunderstanding me?

948
01:53:13,974 --> 01:53:20,163
If I ever said anything untoward,
it's for your own good, Babli

949
01:53:20,254 --> 01:53:23,769
I'll be the judge of that, Didi.
I'm not a kid anymore

950
01:53:23,934 --> 01:53:27,370
Think of your own good,
think of your life

951
01:53:27,654 --> 01:53:35,493
My life is for you.
What have I left but you?

952
01:53:38,854 --> 01:53:43,291
If you leave me, this
loneliness will drive me mad, Babli !

953
01:53:43,374 --> 01:53:47,286
It'll drive me mad !
- Who's asking you to be lonely?

954
01:53:47,374 --> 01:53:49,126
Why don't you marry?

955
01:53:52,974 --> 01:53:55,442
Marry. . . ?
- Yes. Get married

956
01:53:55,534 --> 01:53:59,163
How long will I give you company?
Everyone wants to make a family

957
01:53:59,254 --> 01:54:01,688
I too want a home of my own

958
01:54:05,374 --> 01:54:07,934
Babli, sit

959
01:54:11,534 --> 01:54:14,651
You needn't leave home over this

960
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:21,533
I'll get you married to the man
you want. I'll give whatever you want

961
01:54:22,334 --> 01:54:26,009
Yes, whatever you want.
- Then let me leave

962
01:54:27,814 --> 01:54:32,968
Are you too shy to tell me?
I know where you want to go

963
01:54:33,774 --> 01:54:36,891
I know whom you want to marry.
- You are mistaken

964
01:54:36,974 --> 01:54:41,092
Don't you lie to me.
- You're so old-fashioned

965
01:54:41,174 --> 01:54:45,087
Talking to a man, laughing with him,
doesn't mean I'm in love with him

966
01:54:45,174 --> 01:54:48,325
Try as you might, you
aren't deceiving your sister

967
01:54:48,654 --> 01:54:50,326
You may assume
whatever you wish. I'm leaving

968
01:54:50,574 --> 01:54:56,205
Babli ! I'm not letting you leave!
Never! Tell me the truth !

969
01:54:56,294 --> 01:55:00,606
Why do you want to leave?
- Because you've lost your senses

970
01:55:00,854 --> 01:55:03,766
You want to force Jiten
upon me! Let go of my hand

971
01:55:03,854 --> 01:55:08,803
No Babli ! No! Don't
go away! I beg of you !

972
01:55:08,894 --> 01:55:13,046
Oh why do you hate me?
Babli, have pity on your sister!

973
01:55:13,134 --> 01:55:16,126
Babli ! Stop! For my sake!

974
01:55:36,014 --> 01:55:37,732
What happened?

975
01:55:45,334 --> 01:55:47,325
Babli went away

976
01:55:48,814 --> 01:55:55,606
She too is gone. . .
leaving me all alone

977
01:55:58,214 --> 01:56:00,330
Uncle, Ms Sunita is here

978
01:56:09,254 --> 01:56:11,893
You. . . ? So late at night?

979
01:56:18,774 --> 01:56:23,450
What's the mater Sunita?
Is Ms Amita all right?

980
01:56:26,014 --> 01:56:27,413
Didi. . . ?

981
01:56:28,254 --> 01:56:32,041
She looked harried today.
I was concerned

982
01:56:37,534 --> 01:56:44,212
You care for Didi?
- Who wouldn't? Why do you ask?

983
01:56:46,174 --> 01:56:49,644
She's fine.

984
01:56:50,974 --> 01:56:54,364
You must take care of her always.
Else, I'll quarrel with you

985
01:56:54,454 --> 01:56:57,844
What are you saying? What
has come over you today?

986
01:57:01,214 --> 01:57:02,488
Today. . .

987
01:57:04,534 --> 01:57:06,525
today's a happy day for me

988
01:57:07,414 --> 01:57:10,451
Didi, I'm getting married tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

989
01:57:10,894 --> 01:57:15,843
Jitu, why didn't you tell me earlier?
- Are you marrying my uncle?

990
01:57:16,854 --> 01:57:21,848
Your uncle is just a friend of mine.
The one I'm marrying, is a lovely boy

991
01:57:28,174 --> 01:57:31,689
Why are you silent?
Won't you congratulate me?

992
01:57:32,174 --> 01:57:36,452
Why not? Sushma, get some sweets

993
01:57:41,734 --> 01:57:47,809
Sunita, are you joking?
- Strange of you. . .

994
01:57:47,894 --> 01:57:52,172
to take the truth for a joke,
and you take a joke to be true?

995
01:57:54,574 --> 01:57:59,250
Look into my eyes and say it.
Everything was a joke?

996
01:58:00,214 --> 01:58:02,010
Tell me you don't love me

997
01:58:04,614 --> 01:58:09,404
Is it a must to marry everyone
one has a light romance with?

998
01:58:10,094 --> 01:58:12,813
Life is to be enjoyed.
That's all I know

999
01:58:12,894 --> 01:58:15,567
I'd hate to cry after I'm married.

1000
01:58:15,654 --> 01:58:18,327
Were you to marry me
you'd never be happy?

1001
01:58:19,814 --> 01:58:22,089
Would it be a life of misery?

1002
01:58:23,014 --> 01:58:24,732
That's my lot.

1003
01:58:25,894 --> 01:58:30,490
I've been very lucky.
I always liked a comfortable life

1004
01:58:30,934 --> 01:58:34,722
I'm marrying a millionaire

1005
01:58:35,014 --> 01:58:36,811
Congratulations

1006
01:58:36,974 --> 01:58:41,525
How come the millionaire's bride-to-be
is standing in a poor man's hovel?

1007
01:58:45,254 --> 01:58:51,773
I don't take you for an enemy.
- Thanks

1008
01:58:52,734 --> 01:58:56,932
I shall never forget this courtesy

1009
01:58:59,454 --> 01:59:01,523
I'm getting late

1010
01:59:16,694 --> 01:59:22,724
Whether you sell your
share or whether you pawn it. . .

1011
01:59:23,174 --> 01:59:27,611
you aren't mortgaging my share.

1012
01:59:29,014 --> 01:59:31,972
Just selling my shares won't
help pay back Ms Amita's debts.

1013
01:59:32,374 --> 01:59:34,092
Her debts run into millions

1014
01:59:34,454 --> 01:59:37,206
I take the responsibility.
You'll get back every cent

1015
01:59:37,694 --> 01:59:40,527
At this point of time,
you must help her

1016
01:59:45,414 --> 01:59:50,885
Help whom? The person who
wouldn't let me marry Babli?

1017
01:59:52,014 --> 01:59:53,732
Why don't you understand?

1018
01:59:53,814 --> 01:59:56,772
Helping her now will
pave the way to marry Babli.

1019
01:59:56,854 --> 01:59:59,414
I'm sure, she will be happy to oblige

1020
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:07,532
Not afterwards. Before.
First I marry. Then I help

1021
02:00:08,574 --> 02:00:15,286
Will you cash in on this crisis?
- Give and take

1022
02:00:16,974 --> 02:00:20,410
I'm your little brother
- I'm ashamed of you !

1023
02:00:39,214 --> 02:00:41,853
Will you marry me?
- Marry. . . ?

1024
02:00:41,934 --> 02:00:43,925
Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow itself?

1025
02:00:44,014 --> 02:00:48,485
Or the day after?
- Right now! Right away!

1026
02:00:48,574 --> 02:00:51,041
Come on, let's find ourselves a priest

1027
02:00:55,134 --> 02:00:59,047
Have you run away from home?
- Yes, Hollywood style

1028
02:00:59,134 --> 02:01:02,570
Eloping is in vogue!
- Stop raving

1029
02:01:02,854 --> 02:01:06,403
I'm not about to let this happen.
How will I face your sister?

1030
02:01:07,974 --> 02:01:10,727
Just let the wedding get over.
Afterwards, I might even be willing. . .

1031
02:01:10,814 --> 02:01:13,851
to help her tide the crisis.
- What kind of crisis?

1032
02:01:15,014 --> 02:01:19,166
All because of that Jitendra Gupta.
The directors want him out

1033
02:01:19,254 --> 02:01:22,564
Simple. Throw him out.
- Why throw him out?

1034
02:01:23,094 --> 02:01:27,849
Because he's worthless.
What is he? Just a news editor

1035
02:01:28,294 --> 02:01:32,924
He has got the board warring. I don't
understand why he doesn't leave

1036
02:01:33,534 --> 02:01:35,411
I think he's a cheap fellow

1037
02:01:39,014 --> 02:01:41,369
What did I say?
- That's what you deserve

1038
02:01:41,734 --> 02:01:42,962
Come here

1039
02:01:49,094 --> 02:01:54,168
You stay away from him. You will
marry with your sister's consent

1040
02:01:54,414 --> 02:01:59,169
Not her consent. Mine!
I'm going to marry Bikram!

1041
02:02:04,214 --> 02:02:07,524
Didi's photo? In your bedroom?

1042
02:02:19,974 --> 02:02:21,612
Madam. . .

1043
02:02:28,414 --> 02:02:30,132
Mr Verma is here

1044
02:02:33,654 --> 02:02:35,133
Mr Verma

1045
02:02:49,374 --> 02:02:50,807
Ms Amita. . .

1046
02:02:56,614 --> 02:02:58,491
Are you all right?

1047
02:03:02,654 --> 02:03:07,045
Babli has gone away
and I don't know where

1048
02:03:07,214 --> 02:03:12,129
Don't worry. She's fine.
She came to my house last night

1049
02:03:13,534 --> 02:03:15,330
Your house?
- Yes

1050
02:03:15,414 --> 02:03:18,166
She wants to marry Bikram

1051
02:03:20,574 --> 02:03:22,723
Bikram. . . ?
- Yes

1052
02:03:26,974 --> 02:03:30,125
Why did she desert me for that?

1053
02:03:30,734 --> 02:03:34,522
I told her she can
marry whoever she wants

1054
02:03:35,254 --> 02:03:40,692
You said that? Then why
did she have to leave?

1055
02:03:42,054 --> 02:03:44,010
I don't understand. . .

1056
02:03:44,534 --> 02:03:49,289
if she loves Bikram,
why did she slap him?

1057
02:03:51,494 --> 02:03:56,727
What did you say? She slapped Bikram?

1058
02:03:56,814 --> 02:04:00,523
Yes, he spoke against Mr Gupta

1059
02:04:05,414 --> 02:04:07,608
Then it's true!

1060
02:04:09,294 --> 02:04:14,971
Silly girl ! Why did she lie to me?
I knew she doesn't like Bikram

1061
02:04:15,374 --> 02:04:16,932
I knew it well !

1062
02:04:17,494 --> 02:04:21,169
I'm not going to let her
ruin her life by marrying Bikram

1063
02:04:21,374 --> 02:04:24,013
Never!

1064
02:04:24,494 --> 02:04:26,803
I won't let this marriage happen

1065
02:04:34,814 --> 02:04:40,172
Not Bikram. It's me Didi. Your Babli.
Why are you so worried?

1066
02:04:41,694 --> 02:04:48,008
You ask me why I'm worried?
You're worried, how can I not be?

1067
02:04:48,334 --> 02:04:53,885
But Didi. . .
- You mustn't have slept all night

1068
02:04:55,214 --> 02:05:00,334
I did. Had a sound sleep.
- Liar

1069
02:05:01,534 --> 02:05:05,572
Did you ever have a sound sleep
unless your sister tucked you in?

1070
02:05:07,454 --> 02:05:10,889
You suffer and make
your sister suffer!

1071
02:05:11,574 --> 02:05:14,849
I'll punish you ! Just you come home

1072
02:05:17,134 --> 02:05:22,083
But Didi, listen. . .
- Not a word

1073
02:05:22,774 --> 02:05:27,928
I know. You're crying on the sly

1074
02:05:33,174 --> 02:05:37,213
Come back. . . come back to your sister

1075
02:05:40,134 --> 02:05:45,083
Coming. . . I'm coming right away.
- Hurry!

1076
02:05:45,534 --> 02:05:49,446
And tell Bikram, you
aren't marrying him

1077
02:05:50,254 --> 02:05:56,090
But I'm going to marry Bikram.
- But why?

1078
02:05:56,494 --> 02:05:59,326
Why are you out to destroy yourself?

1079
02:05:59,534 --> 02:06:02,809
You too are out to destroy
your happiness for my sake!

1080
02:06:03,174 --> 02:06:08,202
How can I let this happen?
No! I'm not coming

1081
02:06:08,614 --> 02:06:10,808
Listen Babli. . .

1082
02:06:19,094 --> 02:06:23,326
What happened?
- She won't come

1083
02:06:23,934 --> 02:06:28,610
She says, my happiness will
be destroyed if she returns

1084
02:06:28,694 --> 02:06:30,525
She said that?

1085
02:06:32,094 --> 02:06:37,248
Meaningless drivel ! Let me
see how she won't return

1086
02:06:37,574 --> 02:06:41,567
Have I not even this right?
I'm going to drag her here

1087
02:06:41,654 --> 02:06:46,091
No Ms Amita ! Stop! I know
why she's doing all this

1088
02:06:46,894 --> 02:06:50,125
She too knows that you
are in love with Mr Gupta

1089
02:06:53,134 --> 02:06:54,533
Good God !

1090
02:07:00,134 --> 02:07:07,529
The only way out. . .
then this is the only way

1091
02:07:24,534 --> 02:07:26,525
Where is she?

1092
02:07:26,614 --> 02:07:32,052
If you want to see me alive, come
back to me! Babli ! Don't hide from me!

1093
02:07:32,134 --> 02:07:33,647
Madam. . .

1094
02:07:35,574 --> 02:07:38,246
Where's Babli?

1095
02:07:38,334 --> 02:07:41,883
She went out with Mr Bikram.
She left this note for you

1096
02:07:42,694 --> 02:07:45,845
Didi, I knew you'd come here for me

1097
02:07:45,934 --> 02:07:49,324
But now it's time for you to
think of your own happiness

1098
02:07:49,654 --> 02:07:53,488
By the time you receive this letter,
I would've married Bikram

1099
02:08:06,734 --> 02:08:09,487
No. . .

1100
02:08:24,534 --> 02:08:28,686
Married already?

1101
02:08:46,774 --> 02:08:50,483
You must give a month's
notice for a civil marriage

1102
02:08:50,574 --> 02:08:53,088
Only afterwards can
I conduct the marriage

1103
02:08:53,814 --> 02:08:58,604
But we want to get married today!
- There's the law, lady

1104
02:08:58,854 --> 02:09:01,607
I'm a government registrar.
Not a priest

1105
02:09:01,694 --> 02:09:03,810
You may fill in the notification.
A month afterwards. . .

1106
02:09:03,894 --> 02:09:06,169
you may come to get married.
- But. . .

1107
02:09:23,054 --> 02:09:27,047
Your sister left a while ago.
She wasn't in a good shape

1108
02:09:27,134 --> 02:09:29,728
What happened to her?
- She read your letter

1109
02:09:29,814 --> 02:09:34,968
Then she went insane! Didn't even
recognise me. She's in bad shape

1110
02:09:37,534 --> 02:09:42,562
Oh, what am I to do?

1111
02:09:47,134 --> 02:09:50,809
The family always
interferes till the wedding is over

1112
02:09:51,174 --> 02:09:53,404
In a while, the two
of you will patch up

1113
02:09:59,454 --> 02:10:04,369
Didi is in a bad shape.
She's so miserable. . .

1114
02:10:05,574 --> 02:10:08,929
Where is she?
- I don't know

1115
02:10:09,014 --> 02:10:11,812
She seems to have left here in
a disturbed state a while ago

1116
02:10:22,694 --> 02:10:26,972
Didn't you have this shoulder
to weep on? Why that shoulder?

1117
02:10:31,574 --> 02:10:35,169
Mr Verma, this is Gupta. I'm
calling from your residence

1118
02:10:35,254 --> 02:10:37,290
Has Ms Amita reached home?

1119
02:10:37,654 --> 02:10:39,963
She seems to have left a
while ago in a disturbed state.

1120
02:10:40,054 --> 02:10:42,204
Where might she have gone?

1121
02:10:42,454 --> 02:10:45,844
There's a board
meeting today. Maybe. . .

1122
02:10:54,814 --> 02:10:57,282
We've waited long enough.
Maybe Ms Amita and Mr Verma. . .

1123
02:10:57,374 --> 02:11:00,844
don't wish to attend this meeting.
- Let them not

1124
02:11:01,774 --> 02:11:04,334
Gentlemen, the quorum is full

1125
02:11:04,854 --> 02:11:08,847
I request Mr
Gulabchand to chair the meeting

1126
02:11:15,414 --> 02:11:18,451
Some members wish to move
a no-confidence motion. . .

1127
02:11:18,534 --> 02:11:20,603
against the managing director.

1128
02:11:20,974 --> 02:11:22,692
We have to decide. . .

1129
02:11:22,774 --> 02:11:28,087
whether Ms Amita
remains our managing director

1130
02:11:29,134 --> 02:11:32,604
Welcome Mr Verma. We
have been expecting you

1131
02:11:44,894 --> 02:11:46,566
No!

1132
02:11:48,174 --> 02:11:49,926
Don't look at me like that!

1133
02:11:51,094 --> 02:11:54,166
Don't look at me in anger! No!

1134
02:11:56,174 --> 02:11:58,642
I know why you're angry

1135
02:12:01,774 --> 02:12:06,325
For my sake, Babli
has ruined her life!

1136
02:12:09,214 --> 02:12:11,284
Not here.
- Where might she be?

1137
02:12:11,374 --> 02:12:13,603
At home perhaps?
- Let's look in the library

1138
02:12:13,774 --> 02:12:16,766
I think. . .

1139
02:12:21,574 --> 02:12:23,690
I swear by you !

1140
02:12:23,774 --> 02:12:30,691
For the sake of your Babli,
I can even give my life!

1141
02:12:32,654 --> 02:12:38,411
Just think. The newspaper we've
pumped millions into, is our enemy

1142
02:12:38,494 --> 02:12:41,486
I went along with them
for the sake of the paper!

1143
02:12:43,494 --> 02:12:46,769
The ones I trusted
turn out to be my enemies!

1144
02:12:47,854 --> 02:12:54,885
They want to throw me out! They
want to grab my father's newspaper

1145
02:12:56,054 --> 02:12:58,932
Didi. . .
- Open up

1146
02:13:00,614 --> 02:13:03,286
I won't let them have
my father's newspaper!

1147
02:13:03,934 --> 02:13:08,291
You hear? I shall never let that be!

1148
02:13:08,734 --> 02:13:11,612
Never! Never!

1149
02:13:43,214 --> 02:13:44,966
Call a doctor

1150
02:13:51,574 --> 02:13:56,647
No Mr Verma ! Not as long as I'm alive!

1151
02:13:57,734 --> 02:13:59,690
Never!
- What. . . ?

1152
02:14:04,974 --> 02:14:07,408
After I'm gone. . .

1153
02:14:11,694 --> 02:14:16,722
Mr Verma, call Jitendra

1154
02:14:19,054 --> 02:14:23,252
Jiten is right here, Didi
Why can't she recognise people?

1155
02:14:23,734 --> 02:14:25,531
You want to tell Jitendra something?

1156
02:14:26,934 --> 02:14:33,533
Tell him I haven't
mortgaged Daddy's old office

1157
02:14:35,454 --> 02:14:39,447
Let him start a new paper from here.
- I shall tell him that

1158
02:14:39,774 --> 02:14:44,894
But don't ever tell him that. . .
- What. . . ?

1159
02:14:48,654 --> 02:14:50,406
That I too. . .

1160
02:14:52,094 --> 02:14:54,733
Never tell him that! Never!

1161
02:14:56,574 --> 02:15:03,206
Just tell him to start a new paper

1162
02:15:07,054 --> 02:15:13,527
The Eternal Spring will return
