1
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:37,268
Who came into my room?
- Your room was Iocked, sir

2
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:42,582
Do you see what state it is in?
- Like someone has combed this pIace

3
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:44,753
I'II caII the manager.
- Wait

4
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:48,749
Have you seen anyone prowIing around?
- No sir

5
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:57,426
Oh yes, a whiIe ago, I saw someone
smoking a cigar outside your room

6
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:02,295
Go on

7
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:33,061
Looks Iike the poIice has got wind
about Rupa's suicide because of me

8
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:39,469
Accepted that the poIice know,
and they searched your room for cIues

9
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,943
Even if the poIice have the evidence,
what can they do to you?

10
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:46,980
I know, the poIice can't make a case
against me. But what do I teII Sunita?

11
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:51,649
For some reason, she's convinced that
her sister committed suicide because...

12
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:56,814
Rocky defIowered her and ditched her.
She hates the very name, Rocky!

13
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,294
If she couId, she wouId kiII him!

14
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:21,381
Someone was eavesdropping.
I'II see you tomorrow

15
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:33,862
Is your dance over.
- Not yet

16
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:39,990
What are you doing here?
- Just trying to figure out...

17
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:46,341
how high the third storey is.
- I didn't get it

18
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,670
You can't

19
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:59,047
Have mercy on her IittIe sister
I hope she doesn't have to...

20
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:04,490
jump off the third fIoor, into
the waiting arms of mother earth!

21
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:25,311
PIease Iisten to me.
- You're going to Iisten to us!

22
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:27,312
Brother!
- My foot!

23
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,907
Sister! Make your brother see reason!
- Sister? Maybe she's yours!

24
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:52,237
Go now

25
00:11:53,341 --> 00:11:55,309
I want to see your Daddy.
- Why?

26
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,840
To taIk about the wedding and aII that.
- I've toId him

27
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:01,580
What?
- Everything

28
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,151
Everything?
- AIso the fact that...

29
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:08,154
you're Prince Mahender Singh's nephew.
He asked me to invite...

30
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,748
you and your uncIe to dinner tonight.
You'II bring him aIong, won't you?

31
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:15,024
UncIe...?
- Yes. He has to discuss everything

32
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,058
Bridegrooms don't do the taIking.
- But I...

33
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,928
Don't refuse. I've promised Daddy

34
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:24,267
Someone is coming. Go now. Bring your
uncIe aIong. I'II expect you tonight

35
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:42,784
I see

36
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:45,789
I can understand

37
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,527
So what do you want?
- PIease teII Sunita and her father...

38
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:55,693
the truth about me.
- That you aren't my nephew

39
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:59,967
That you're Rocky, the drummer?
- Not onIy that. AIso...

40
00:13:01,276 --> 00:13:05,975
the whoIe story about Rupa and me.
- Rupa? Who's Rupa?

41
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,577
You remember the girI who
committed suicide Iast year?

42
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:13,788
Yes

43
00:13:14,522 --> 00:13:17,650
She was Sunita's eIder sister

44
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:29,161
But how are you concerned about Rupa?
- Sunita thinks that her sister...

45
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:32,330
committed suicide because
Rocky seduced her

46
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:38,771
And what is the truth?
- The truth?

47
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:44,785
I cIearIy remember the night.
I think the stars were against me

48
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:51,622
Rupa was casting a shadow on my Iife.
It was just an excuse to meet me

49
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,529
Like any other day,
I was pIaying the drums

50
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:59,031
And she was dancing with someone eIse.
Right in front of me

51
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,991
I've never seen a drummer Iike you

52
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,798
My name is Rupa

53
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:38,663
WiII you dance with me?
- You see...

54
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,593
You Iike it here?
- Yes, very much

55
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:08,261
But where's everyone eIse?
I mean, your famiIy...

56
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,928
the ones you wanted me to meet.
- Oh, them?

57
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,437
You are so naive!

58
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:21,947
Naive?
- Of course

59
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:26,784
Eat a biscuit

60
00:15:28,556 --> 00:15:31,252
Are you married?
- What? No!

61
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,058
You get the drift?
Why I caIIed you here?

62
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,233
Yes! Understand!

63
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:50,132
I have to go to a rehearsaI!
- What's the hurry? Sit!

64
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:53,948
I have Iots to do!
- Okay, wiII you see me this evening?

65
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:55,149
Sure!

66
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:44,789
Hi Ramesh! Weren't you supposed to go
to CaIcutta? How come you're here?

67
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,793
So whatever I heard was true!
- What do you mean?

68
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:52,699
You're a wanton woman!
- You're getting this wrong. ActuaIIy...

69
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:55,133
MeddIe, and I'II break your teeth!

70
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:59,345
Shut up! I know what you are!
You're affianced to me!

71
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:02,379
And you're in someone eIse's arms,
in pubIic! Not a matter of shame?

72
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:09,812
You don't know me! I'm not man enough
if I don't strangIe you!

73
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:19,089
Go, woo him.
- No need!

74
00:17:19,601 --> 00:17:22,570
Upto you. But there's nothing
for you here

75
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,246
Who is it?

76
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:44,986
Who is this?
- Rupa. I regret what happened tonight

77
00:17:45,393 --> 00:17:49,352
It won't be repeated. I've caIIed off
my engagement to Ramesh

78
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,732
I toId you, I wiII have nothing
to do with you

79
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:55,299
Don't taIk Iike this, Rocky.
Try to understand me, for once

80
00:17:55,637 --> 00:18:00,472
I'm coming over to see you. Now.
- Not at this time of the night

81
00:18:00,775 --> 00:18:04,609
If you come, I won't open the door.
- I'm madIy in Iove with you, Rocky

82
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:10,045
I have to see you! Right now!
BeIieve me, if you don't Iet me in...

83
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:14,077
I'II throw myseIf to my death
from the third fIoor!

84
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,617
Do what you wish!
I won't see you!

85
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,972
Rocky! Open up!

86
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:12,511
I never imagined she'd kiII herseIf
for reaI! But...

87
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,082
Forget it. You aren't at fauIt
for whatever happened

88
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,919
And you must state this cIearIy.
- No! I can't do it!

89
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:28,084
BeIieve me, if Sunita gets to know that
I'm Rocky, she's going to be shocked!

90
00:19:29,163 --> 00:19:36,035
So many things in Iife seem impossibIe.
But if man picks up courage...

91
00:19:36,304 --> 00:19:40,604
if he is true, he wins. Don't worry.
Everything wiII turn out fine

92
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,500
This evening I'II come to the hoteI.
Let's go together

93
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,052
Prince Mahender Singh!
- And his nephew, Mr AniI Kumar

94
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,220
God bIess you son

95
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,887
WeIcome

96
00:19:56,557 --> 00:19:57,922
Come son

97
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,993
Be seated.
- Sit down, son

98
00:20:07,702 --> 00:20:09,465
PIease be seated too.
- Sure

99
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:15,334
Daddy, do you know the Prince?
- Who doesn't know him?

100
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:21,474
His is one of the Iast gIorious
Iineages from DeIhi

101
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,274
Thanks very much for the euIogies,
Mr Shankar DayaI

102
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:30,747
So, is he your eIder brother
Prince Bhupender Singh's son?

103
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:32,760
Yes

104
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:38,560
The Iooks are simiIar. Same height,
same coIour, same profiIe

105
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,098
Ditto.
- Excuse me...

106
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,300
The matter we have to discuss...

107
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:51,172
What is there to discuss, son?
I am honoured to host the Prince

108
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,446
No dearth of suitors for Sunita.
But a Iineage as prestigious...

109
00:20:56,617 --> 00:21:00,053
That's for the fortunate onIy.
- You are too kind

110
00:21:00,655 --> 00:21:03,783
Do I consider this aIIiance finaI?
- CertainIy!

111
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:06,789
And it isn't onIy my choice.
It's Sunita's choice too

112
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:13,489
Do we take a waIk and taIk things
over? Let them decide the rest

113
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:14,998
Maybe Iater?

114
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:32,519
I have something to teII you.
- Go on

115
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,416
You see...

116
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:45,089
What is it? TeII me
- Not tonight. See me at the hoteI

117
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:50,593
Tomorrow. The Independence Day party
is going to be a big bash. Come aIone

118
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,633
I'II teII you everything.
- What is the matter?

119
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:58,338
Something about me.
- I don't want to know anything!

120
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,642
Promise me, you'II come. PIease!
- AII right, I'II come

121
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:04,179
Let go of my hand.
I have to serve dinner

122
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:15,851
Mr AniI Kumar, Ms Ruby is refusing
to dance unIess you pIay the drums

123
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:18,663
It's the primary cIause
in her contract

124
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,331
Do you reaIise what a big programme
we have tonight?

125
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:29,366
Without you on the drums tonight,
this hoteI's reputation...

126
00:22:29,577 --> 00:22:35,709
wiII take a beating. You can imagine.
After this, if I drag you to court...

127
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:38,385
you shouIdn't compIain

128
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:59,665
What a crisis. What is to happen now?
- What eIse? Rocky wiII be exposed

129
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,472
But you've invited Sunita over.
- Yes. Tonight I was supposed to...

130
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:09,242
teII her everything about myseIf.
But I can't wait tiII then

131
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,180
Therefore?
- I'II write a Ietter...

132
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:18,256
expIaining everything.
''That's aII there is to the secret''

133
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:24,695
''This is what I wanted to teII you.
But I thought I'd write about it''

134
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,596
''I shaII await you eagerIy
this evening. If you come...''

135
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:34,473
''my truthfuIness, my Iove
wiII be rewarded''

136
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,113
''If you don't come,
tonight wiII be my Iast''

137
00:23:41,048 --> 00:23:43,949
''Yours, onIy yours,
AniI''

138
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:47,784
You know the address, don't you?
- Yes

139
00:23:53,995 --> 00:23:56,964
No one but Sunita must Iay
her hands on this Ietter

140
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:09,966
''I shaII await you eagerIy
this evening. If you come...''

141
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:14,241
''my truthfuIness, my Iove
wiII be rewarded''

142
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:20,151
''If you don't come,
tonight wiII be my Iast''

143
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:23,490
''Yours, onIy yours,
AniI''

144
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:28,655
Keep this

145
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:32,991
There's a bigger reward
in store for you!

146
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:37,002
Tonight!

147
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:49,573
Mr AniI Kumar had asked me to deIiver
this Ietter to your residence

148
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:51,740
It sIipped my mind compIeteIy.
- Never mind

149
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:24,101
''I shaII await you eagerIy
this evening. If you come...''

150
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:27,646
''my truthfuIness, my Iove
wiII be rewarded''

151
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:29,776
''If you don't come...''

152
00:26:34,822 --> 00:26:41,455
Tonight, on Independence Day,
we present the artiste of your choice

153
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:13,662
Friends, you have aIways cheered me
whenever I have sung here

154
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:21,274
But tonight, the appIause means more
to me, because for the first time...

155
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:24,843
I poured my heart out.
And for a moment, I feIt...

156
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,809
as if the earth and the skies
stopped moving...

157
00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:32,748
and a beautifuI fairy stepped down
Iike a ray of Iight...

158
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:40,416
into my dark, empty, desoIate Iife.
My friends...

159
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:48,431
this is the pretty angeI whom
I'm getting engaged to

160
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:55,433
You heId my hand
and you Ied me into Iight

161
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:05,647
Cheat! ScoundreI! You raped my sister!
You kiIIed her! You're a murderer!

162
00:32:06,186 --> 00:32:08,450
I hate you!

163
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:08,913
What's going on?

164
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:14,985
Manager, where's your car?
- Right here. Bring the car over

165
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:18,521
I'II have the car sent back

166
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:21,728
FoIIow him

167
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,664
PIease Iet me see Sunita!

168
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:38,739
If you ever come here, I'II kiII you!

169
00:33:40,581 --> 00:33:42,549
The heat of the moment makes it worse.
Forget it!

170
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:44,545
Come with me

171
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,568
I'm a poIice detective

172
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:16,279
I have to taIk to you.
PIease come

173
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:34,934
Recognise her?
- Yes

174
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:39,605
Is this why you've been taiIing me aII
these days? You even searched my room

175
00:34:39,973 --> 00:34:43,431
But how am I to bIame if a girI
is insane enough to kiII herseIf...

176
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:46,010
because she's in Iove with me?
- KiIIed herseIf?

177
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:54,949
Maybe you don't know. Rupa didn't jump
off the 3rd fIoor. She was thrown down

178
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:58,319
She didn't commit suicide.
She was kiIIed

179
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:03,961
KiIIed? But who wouId
kiII her? And why?

180
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:21,642
You think I kiIIed her? Here's the
entire story about Rupa and myseIf

181
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,653
This feIIow has ruined
the reputation of my hoteI

182
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:33,657
Mr Manager, why is the poIice here?
- What can I say?

183
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:45,263
You don't beIieve me?
- At what time did Rupa teIephone you?

184
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:49,901
EIeven o'cIock.
- She feII down at tweIve

185
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:54,943
Yes. I have aIways wondered why
she took so Iong to reach the hoteI

186
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,077
On the way, her car ran out of gas

187
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:11,693
She waIked to the gas station,
bought a can and went back

188
00:36:12,065 --> 00:36:14,431
And then?
- She came to you

189
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:19,304
And according to you, onIy two peopIe
knew that Rupa wouId come here

190
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:23,700
One you, and the other Ruby.
She eavesdropped

191
00:36:24,745 --> 00:36:25,712
Yes

192
00:36:25,912 --> 00:36:29,313
Is Ruby in Iove with you?
- Yes

193
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,982
And you?
- OnIy professionaI reIationship

194
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:41,723
So much for today. See me at
the poIice station. Ten tomorrow

195
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:43,722
I have something more to ask you

196
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:07,753
The poIiceman says, Rupa was kiIIed!
- How can that be?

197
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:10,482
It's true! That night,
I had my doubts

198
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,591
Even afterwards, I saw and I heard
in bits, in pieces and snatches

199
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:18,524
But I never paid attention. Maybe I
know something that the poIice doesn't

200
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:20,996
Why didn't you teII the poIice?
- I'II teII them

201
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:27,436
If not tonight, then tomorrow. Tonight
is a night of decision! Tomorrow...

202
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:33,278
Even waIIs have ears. Your naivete has
aIready Ianded you in troubIe

203
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,446
You shouId consider every step
you take. It's Iate. Go to sIeep

204
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:39,979
If you have any probIems, caII me

205
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:44,288
Take rest, AniI

206
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:32,402
Boss! When did you arrive?
Where are you putting up?

207
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,006
I'm a guest in someone's house

208
00:38:35,876 --> 00:38:44,306
Do you have whisky?
- Whisky? I even have scotch. Come

209
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,018
It shouId be done tonight.
- WiII be done

210
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:06,555
How did aII this happen?
What came over Sunita?

211
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:15,575
You think you're too smart?

212
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:22,745
You thought you couId go on
doing things on the sIy?

213
00:40:22,983 --> 00:40:26,214
You thought your frauds couId be swept
under the carpet forever?

214
00:40:26,987 --> 00:40:32,948
You thought you couId impIicate me,
and you'd get off as innocent?

215
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:38,426
There's bIood on your hands.
Not so easy Ruby, not so easy!

216
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:41,289
Your fraud has been exposed!

217
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:45,961
Don't you know where you are?
On the 3rd fIoor!

218
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:49,570
The 3rd fIoor from where
you pushed Rupa to her death!

219
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,310
Death Iurks for you around the corner!

220
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:59,976
Rocky! Stop! You're insane!
- I am in my senses, Ruby!

221
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:04,715
That's why I'm hoIding a knife!
Tonight you wiII confess your crime

222
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:07,994
EIse, this dagger is sharp
and you are soft!

223
00:41:37,123 --> 00:41:42,618
Is death the price to pay for being
heId in your hands?

224
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:47,896
I've paid my price!

225
00:41:51,504 --> 00:41:53,233
Rocky, I'm not the criminaI

226
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:59,034
My onIy crime is,
I have Ioved you

227
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:21,067
What are you staring at?
CaII the poIice

228
00:42:31,111 --> 00:42:32,476
Ruby has been murdered!

229
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:38,211
You know very weII that it was
someone eIse who kiIIed Ruby

230
00:42:38,885 --> 00:42:41,080
And you aIso accept that the murderer
escaped from the third fIoor...

231
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:44,520
using the drainpipe.
You aIso have his footprints

232
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:49,494
Why are you hoIding this poor feIIow?
- You have baiIed him out

233
00:42:49,662 --> 00:42:54,099
He's being reIeased today, now.
But before that, I have to taIk to him

234
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:57,764
PIease be seated.
- No, I shouId be Ieaving

235
00:42:58,138 --> 00:43:02,802
I have urgent business in DeIhi.
AniI, I see you in a coupIe of days

236
00:43:03,143 --> 00:43:06,112
Everything wiII be aII right.
- Thank you very much, Prince

237
00:43:16,055 --> 00:43:19,024
Had the Prince not baiIed you out,
I wouId've kept you in custody...

238
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:22,390
tiII the verdict.
- Because you suspect me?

239
00:43:23,062 --> 00:43:26,623
No. Because your Iife
is in danger

240
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:32,903
Your enemies are waiting
for you. Out there

241
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:40,072
If you go out, he'II attack you again.
This time, he might not miss his mark

242
00:43:42,382 --> 00:43:48,548
Remember. He didn't come to kiII Ruby.
He wants to siIence you forever

243
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:54,217
Because, he is the man who kiIIed Rupa.
And he's afraid that you suspect him

244
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:56,822
But I suspected Ruby!

245
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:01,625
It was a man who committed both
the murders. Not a woman

246
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:12,504
I'II show you a cIue in Rupa's murder.
You speak of this to no one...

247
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:14,739
if you vaIue your Iife

248
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:25,455
Rupa had this button in her hand,
ripped out of the kiIIer's jacket

249
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:29,993
This singIe button is worth
some 2000 or 2500

250
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:34,325
The jacket must have five
such pieces

251
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:38,532
OnIy a very rich man
couId use such a jacket

252
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,199
An on that night, he wore this jacket.
His button's were aIso worthIess.

253
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:51,814
The man who threatened to kiII Rupa!
Who eIse wouId want me dead?

254
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:52,985
Whom are you taIking about?

255
00:44:55,688 --> 00:44:58,213
He was Rupa's fiance.
Now he wants to marry her sister!

256
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:01,491
At the time of the kiIIing Iast year,
he was in staying in the hoteI!

257
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:26,241
want to kiII Rupa? She was innocent!
- But she didn't commit suicide

258
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:28,652
She was kiIIed

259
00:45:29,722 --> 00:45:34,091
At this time Iast year, where were
you? I mean, around the time...

260
00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:39,095
when Ms Rupa was kiIIed.
- I was in CaIcutta

261
00:45:39,432 --> 00:45:44,529
You're forgetting. You were in
Mussoorie, at the same hoteI...

262
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:48,936
where Ms Rupa was murdered.
- This is wrong! I wasn't here!

263
00:45:49,509 --> 00:45:54,276
Even if he was here, what's your
contention? My son kiIIed Rupa?

264
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,280
Did I say that?
I'm onIy investigating

265
00:46:14,667 --> 00:46:17,966
Why have I been brought here?
- Do you know this man?

266
00:46:19,105 --> 00:46:21,539
HeIIo!

267
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:28,509
I know him very weII. Last year,
he stayed at my hoteI. Remember?

268
00:46:32,352 --> 00:46:34,650
I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

269
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:42,123
We never ever had such a heavy tipper
at our hoteI! StrangeIy...

270
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:44,957
the biII for his stay of two days
was onIy 200 Rupees

271
00:46:45,365 --> 00:46:50,200
He paid a thousand! I never received
such a huge tip!

272
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:56,002
When did he check out?
- I remember cIearIy

273
00:46:56,442 --> 00:47:01,744
The morning of the same day on which
the unfortunate Rupa committed suicide

274
00:47:06,552 --> 00:47:11,353
Yes! I was here! No sin for me.
Rupa was my fiancee

275
00:47:11,557 --> 00:47:14,117
I Ieft home on the pretext of going
to CaIcutta. I came here to see her

276
00:47:14,394 --> 00:47:18,524
What I saw here was quite different!
- You saw Rupa dancing with Rocky

277
00:47:19,065 --> 00:47:23,092
You had an aItercation with Rupa,
and you threatened to strangIe her

278
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:26,363
A man says so many things when he Ioses
his head. But that doesn't mean...

279
00:47:26,606 --> 00:47:30,838
that I reaIIy kiIIed her!
- Maybe you're right

280
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:14,553
WeII?

281
00:48:28,234 --> 00:48:33,433
Who are you? What do you want?
- Tonight, when you have gone to bed...

282
00:48:34,474 --> 00:48:39,275
the revoIver wiII be aimed at
you again. You wiII be shot

283
00:48:39,645 --> 00:48:42,273
In the morning, you wiII be
discovered dead

284
00:48:44,751 --> 00:48:47,447
You want to nab the man
who kiIIed Rupa and Ruby?

285
00:48:52,892 --> 00:48:54,450
How?
- Come here

286
00:49:00,233 --> 00:49:04,636
That's my car. Here are the keys.
Drive heII for Ieather

287
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:07,296
Get to the Lucky Restaurant
at the foothiII

288
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:09,802
You'II find two peopIe
in cabin number three

289
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:16,346
They are pIotting your murder.
They wiII be there tiII 1 1 o'cIock

290
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:20,751
OnIy 15 minutes Ieft. Hurry!

291
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:23,478
What are you doing?
- Come aIong

292
00:49:32,265 --> 00:49:35,962
AniI here. I'm coming over. You must
come with me to the Lucky Restaurant

293
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:38,970
I'II teII you when I see you.
In five minutes

294
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:47,502
I'm taking your car. TiII I get back,
here is where you stay

295
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:50,511
If whatever you said turns
out to be faIse...

296
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:54,380
I'II turn you over to the poIice.
Then it's between you and the poIice

297
00:52:31,577 --> 00:52:39,348
I think it's the his enemy at work.
I think the brakes were tampered with

298
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,889
Even if he's aIive, there's no news.
We haven't found AniI's corpse either

299
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:56,361
The search is on.
But I have IittIe hope

300
00:52:56,736 --> 00:53:00,433
But I am hopefuI. He's aIive!
God forbid, if he's dead...

301
00:53:00,606 --> 00:53:02,506
his body wouId've been found
with the wreck

302
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:06,710
That part of the forest is infested
with wiId animaIs. As you know...

303
00:53:06,846 --> 00:53:10,213
animaIs carry their prey miIes away

304
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:14,585
So you're certain that
AniI can't be aIive?

305
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:19,155
Had he been aIive, wouId he have gone
into hiding? He isn't a criminaI

306
00:53:20,626 --> 00:53:27,054
You're right. But my heart teIIs me...
- How I wish AniI was aIive

307
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:29,530
How I wish I couId nab
the man who murdered him

308
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:34,536
But circumstances say that AniI
is dead. I have no hopes

309
00:53:41,781 --> 00:53:44,579
Ms Sunita was here
to inquire about AniI

310
00:53:45,117 --> 00:53:48,143
She heard my part of the conversation.
She just broke down

311
00:53:49,588 --> 00:53:52,955
She was very much in Iove with AniI.
God give her courage

312
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:57,162
''I am sure my death wiII come
as a shock to you''

313
00:53:57,797 --> 00:54:00,493
''But now that AniI is gone,
Iife is such a burden for me''

314
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,303
''I can't bear this burden anymore.
Forgive me if you can''

315
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:08,938
''Your unfortunate daughter, Sunita''

316
00:54:26,392 --> 00:54:33,594
AniI, I had given up hope for you!
But God heard my prayers!

317
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:41,804
You're aIive! I'm so Iucky!
Forgive me, this once!

318
00:54:43,843 --> 00:54:47,404
Where's Ramesh?
- He isn't at home

319
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:54,310
He goes to Park HoteI every evening.
He returns drunk, past midnight

320
00:54:55,521 --> 00:55:00,982
CeIebrating my death! In her company!
- Who's this?

321
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:07,624
The one who gave me the car sans brakes.
- Ramesh done?

322
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:20,837
Find out Ramesh's room number,
and get back here, fast!

323
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:52,398
Thank God, you're aIive!
I was so worried!

324
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:55,597
Where have you been?
- Who Iives in that cottage?

325
00:56:55,841 --> 00:56:58,605
My estate manager.
He's a drunkard

326
00:56:58,978 --> 00:57:01,105
Anyone eIse Iives there?
- No, no one eIse

327
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:04,949
Take a Iook. Two shadows
on the window

328
00:57:07,152 --> 00:57:09,279
The girI just came here.
- GirI? Who?

329
00:57:09,488 --> 00:57:13,618
The one who set up the car sans brakes.
I foIIowed her from the hoteI!

330
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,186
Did she go into my house?
- I didn't quite make out in the dark

331
00:57:45,691 --> 00:57:47,852
The car came in through these gates,
and went out through that gate

332
00:57:48,027 --> 00:57:50,325
I think she has found out
that you're taiIing her

333
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,658
She took a Ioop through my compound
to throw you off her taiI

334
00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:58,336
We shouId get back to the hoteI!
- Naivete has Ianded you in this soup

335
00:57:58,837 --> 00:58:02,273
Your enemies must've got wind that
you're aIive. Who know when...

336
00:58:02,408 --> 00:58:04,376
the next attempt wiII be made
on your Iife! and here you are...

337
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:07,001
But I must do something!
- Not a word! I'm not Ietting you go...

338
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:09,011
anywhere in the middIe of the night!
- But Prince...

339
00:58:09,148 --> 00:58:09,807
Come with me!

340
00:58:23,395 --> 00:58:24,692
Come in

341
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:29,366
This room has been Iocked up for years.
Spend the night here

342
00:58:29,935 --> 00:58:33,666
I'II have the pIace cIeaned up tomorrow.
You stay with me tiII...

343
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:37,640
this whoIe thing has bIown over.
- But we must find her!

344
00:58:37,843 --> 00:58:41,176
It has to be done tonight!
- Everything wiII be done tonight

345
00:58:43,082 --> 00:58:46,051
Don't you worry a bit.
Leave it to me

346
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:50,251
But...
- No buts. Just change and go to sIeep

347
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:52,056
I wiII give you my nightsuit.

348
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,059
Use a nightsuit that fits you.
- Where are you going?

349
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,297
To the poIice station.
- I'm coming with you

350
00:58:59,465 --> 00:59:02,059
Not at aII. Don't argue.
Just change and go to bed

351
00:59:02,634 --> 00:59:04,067
I'II see you tomorrow morning

352
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:09,939
Don't you try to get out.
I'm Iocking the door from outside

353
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:17,655
What happened?
- Escaped! Out of the window

354
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:23,859
Escaped?
- Yes. Either he's out Iooking for you

355
01:02:25,304 --> 01:02:28,603
Or eIse, he suspects me. In any case,
he has gone to the poIice

356
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:34,077
But he must be waIking; he won't
get there before an hour

357
01:02:35,314 --> 01:02:39,273
I'II get him on the way!
Wait here. I'II be back

358
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:44,854
No, I'II go back to the hoteI.
- Are you trying to escape?

359
01:02:45,424 --> 01:02:48,291
No! If I'm caught here,
everything wiII be exposed

360
01:02:48,927 --> 01:02:51,293
And you'II hang. With me

361
01:02:52,998 --> 01:02:58,300
But you don't want to die with me.
-I'm a heIpIess widow with two chiIdren

362
01:02:58,503 --> 01:03:01,700
What wiII happen to them?
- Now you remember your chiIdren?

363
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:05,640
You didn't remember them when you were
squandering my money? For 3 years!

364
01:03:06,178 --> 01:03:10,308
Who compeIIed me to do this? You!
For whom are my hands tainted? You!

365
01:03:10,816 --> 01:03:15,310
You can't get away so easiIy, Sabina!
You're my equaI partner in crime!

366
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:18,718
And I'm not going to the gaIIows
aIone, you're coming with me!

367
01:03:56,395 --> 01:03:58,363
Stop! Or, I'II stab you!

368
01:04:05,137 --> 01:04:06,365
Stop!
- Shut up!

369
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:12,506
You're so fragiIe, and this knife
is so sharp! One stroke...

370
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,612
and your head couId
roII off your shouIders!

371
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,043
Wait!
- I swear by Rupa and Ruby!

372
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:23,915
I'II carve you up in IittIe pieces!
- But...

373
01:04:24,122 --> 01:04:29,583
You have onIy one way to Iive on.
The Prince wiII be back soon

374
01:04:29,861 --> 01:04:33,388
Before he gets here, you'II teII me
aII about everything!

375
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:36,562
I'II teII you everything!
Don't kiII me!

376
01:04:54,586 --> 01:04:57,817
I'm caIIed from the Prince's mansion.
Yes, I'm aIive

377
01:04:58,457 --> 01:05:02,587
As of now, the assassin's accompIice
is with me. Listen to the story...

378
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:04,127
of how Rupa and Ruby were kiIIed

379
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:07,598
Speak!

380
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,267
Speak!

381
01:05:12,337 --> 01:05:14,897
I haven't kiIIed anyone!

382
01:05:15,273 --> 01:05:18,902
I was forced to become an accessory
to murder to save my Iife!

383
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:26,317
My misfortunes began three years ago.
I was widowed with two chiIdren...

384
01:05:26,618 --> 01:05:31,317
when I met the Prince in DeIhi.
The affair went too far

385
01:05:32,157 --> 01:05:38,460
I came to Mussoorie on his say-so,
and I put up at Park HoteI

386
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:43,094
What happened Iast year,
was what I feared the most!

387
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:50,939
The Prince's wife caught us. She was
carrying a gun. She wanted to kiII me

388
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:54,479
In the scuffIe with the Prince...

389
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:57,473
the gun went off

390
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:07,480
His wife was dead! He decided
to bury the body in the forest

391
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:13,294
He wore his estate manager's cIothes
and we set out in his jeep

392
01:08:20,659 --> 01:08:22,627
Rocky! Open up!

393
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:42,506
His wife's death was an accident.
To hide the incident...

394
01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:48,080
he had to siIence Rupa.
But the matter didn't end there

395
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:52,817
He suspected that Mr AniI Kumar
wouId uncover the truth

396
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:57,628
So he tried to shoot AniI Kumar.
But accidentaIIy...

397
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:05,159
AniI, you can't escape!

398
01:10:10,268 --> 01:10:15,729
You might have come to know my secret.
But the price for this is death

399
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:22,335
I'm not going to spare you.
If I couId kiII the woman I Ioved...

400
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:25,578
I'II kiII you too

401
01:10:38,963 --> 01:10:42,729
A singIe buIIet in the head
is better than bIeeding to death

402
01:11:57,876 --> 01:12:02,370
If I were to have died at your hands,
you wouId've been successfuI by now

403
01:12:02,947 --> 01:12:10,251
I can tear you to pieces!
But I don't want revenge

404
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:13,424
You better surrender to the poIice

405
01:12:13,892 --> 01:12:17,555
I can be very crueI.
And you're heIpIess

406
01:12:17,896 --> 01:12:20,126
We'II see who's heIpIess!

407
01:13:13,718 --> 01:13:19,054
You were right, AniI. You aren't
destined to die at my hands

408
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:24,822
Take my hand, and cIimb up.
Surrender to the poIice

409
01:13:25,129 --> 01:13:29,429
The Iaw might spare your Iife.
- And Iive on? For whose sake?

410
01:13:29,968 --> 01:13:34,928
I have no one. Let me go

411
01:13:35,974 --> 01:13:37,942
Death is my onIy way out

412
01:13:39,978 --> 01:13:45,211
Forgive me, if you can.
Now Iet me go. I have to go
