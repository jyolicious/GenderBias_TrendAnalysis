1
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:22,780
Don't forget to wish
the lawyer.

2
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:27,450
"Come here, Nathu."
"- Yes, sir."

3
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:35,787
You're so very late!

4
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:38,119
"l'm hungry. Let's go, Gopal."
"- Come on, Sunder."

5
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:45,792
Sunder hit Gopal and
he's bleeding.

6
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,340
They're fighting again.

7
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:53,470
Will you say that again?
- Yes.

8
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,813
"What happened, Gopal?"

9
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:59,817
Did Sunder hit you?
"- No, father."

10
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,819
l fell on a stone
and started bleeding.

11
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:05,487
But Radha said Sunder hit you.

12
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,489
She's lying.
- Yes he did! He did hit him!

13
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,828
"Shut up, Radha!"
When did he hit me?

14
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:12,619
"She's lying, father!"

15
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:15,830
"Well done, my son."

16
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:20,426
You're bleeding but you won't
tattle on your friend.

17
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,247
"Look, Radha. l've built a house"
big enough for Gopal too.

18
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:39,055
Will you live in my house now?
"- No, l won't."

19
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:40,847
Why not?
- lt's my wish!

20
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,327
l don't like your house!

21
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,857
Had it been someone else
in your place...

22
00:02:46,564 --> 00:02:47,531
Let me go!

23
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:54,469
"Well? Don't you know, l was"
a Captain in the army?

24
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,535
"Let him be, sir"
He's a kid.

25
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,877
"Keep him under control, Nathu."
He's getting out of hand.

26
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,874
You're being like a child yourself.

27
00:03:03,181 --> 00:03:05,877
"Go ahead and play, children"

28
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:08,880
"Play with Gopal, Radha."
Always play with equals.

29
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:13,882
He has a car.
But l have a plane.

30
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:17,554
l'll fly Radha all over the world.

31
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,762
l'll take her away one day.

32
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:14,917
No...

33
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,973
Come down here and l'll show you!

34
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,095
Sunder! What are you doing?!

35
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:41,631
l threw the hook in the water
and it fell on the ground.

36
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:42,762
Return my clothes to me!

37
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,094
They won't get off the hook.
Like myself.

38
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,109
Say that again... l like
my name on your lips.

39
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,003
Don't tease me.
Return my clothes to me!

40
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:58,111
l will. But answer my
question first.

41
00:06:58,616 --> 00:06:59,446
l have a hundred times.

42
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,375
You've refused a hundred times
Say 'yes' just once...

43
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:06,952
or you won't get your clothes
- This is ridiculous.

44
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,451
lmagine for a moment that
l'm not Sunder... but Gopal.

45
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:14,264
And Gopal asks you something.

46
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,963
"Your heart is the river Ganga"
"and mine is the river Yamuna"

47
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:54,428
"Tell me, Radha..."
"will they ever find union?"

48
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,780
"No! Never!"

49
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:40,207
"l've spend eons"
"pleading with you"

50
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:49,559
"You'll find no other man"
"as persistent as l am"

51
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:53,226
"Will this burden"
"l carry, ever lessen?"

52
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,824
"Tell me, Radha..."
"will our hearts ever meet?"

53
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,040
"Get lost!"

54
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:34,529
"l thirst for you as"
"the earth does for rain"

55
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:43,540
"Every breath that l take"
"seems to chant your name"

56
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:48,680
"The stones melt,"
"but will your heart?"

57
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,953
"Tell me, Radha..."
"will our hearts ever meet?"

58
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:12,305
"Yes, they will!"
"Now go away"

59
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,907
"Radha, listen..."

60
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,707
Gopal's returning from
London tomorrow!

61
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:29,047
Do you hear?
Gopal's returning from London!

62
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:42,453
Aunty!

63
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:49,459
She's in the prayer room.

64
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,796
What happened?
- Gopal...

65
00:12:56,173 --> 00:12:58,141
What happened? He was okay...
- Not just okay.

66
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:02,673
He's great! He has stood first
in the whole of the University!

67
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,073
Really?
- Of course.

68
00:13:05,382 --> 00:13:10,012
l'm the one who tutored him!
"Read this, if you can't believe me."

69
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:13,217
l'll go and tell everyone.
"- Sweeten your tongue, at least."

70
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,491
Later!

71
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:18,091
Raghu! Look at this...

72
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,998
Sunder isn't here.
"He knows, doesn't he?"

73
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:09,535
Of course. He's been
telling everyone.

74
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:10,939
Why hasn't he come then?

75
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:13,474
He will. At least to the party.
- Party?

76
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,219
Yes. ln your honour.

77
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,438
"Well, lawyer?"
How are you?

78
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:46,913
Why didn't you come
to receive me?

79
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:52,587
l did. On my bicycle.
But you sped away in your car.

80
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,054
l kept calling for you
but you wouldn't hear me.

81
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:02,461
"You're wearing garlands,"
l see.

82
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,599
This one? l brought it for you.
"l wore it, because l didn't meet you."

83
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,797
What's the difference between
the two of us anyway?

84
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:13,609
l feel as if l've turned a lawyer
after you got the degree.

85
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,604
"But now that l meet you,"
"here you are, my friend."

86
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,814
You've been away
for so very long.

87
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:26,756
Let's sit here.

88
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,894
Have you quit the Air Force
and joined flight work?

89
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:35,221
Yes. l train people
in flying.

90
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:39,161
But l don't get the one
l want to take to the skies.

91
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:50,778
l can't tell you what l went through
when l met Gopal today.

92
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,982
Mustn't you ask Gopal too?

93
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:58,978
Do you mean?
- No.

94
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,653
To play together as kids
"is one thing, Radha."

95
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:07,196
But to live together as husband
and wife is another.

96
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,669
All right. l will say it
to him at the party tonight.

97
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,276
Congratulations. You're one
of us lawyers now.

98
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,673
Thank you. Please sit down.

99
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:34,346
"Why're you hiding here, Captain?"

100
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:38,021
l'm watching how the game goes.

101
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,892
Fine. But you've glass is empty.
Let me get you a drink.

102
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:44,690
What shall l get you?
- Don't l get a drink?

103
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:54,306
What can l get you?
- Ask what l've got for you.

104
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,704
What've you got?
- Look there.

105
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,245
l'm here for the
fun of it.

106
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,387
But she's here to say
something to you.

107
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:12,052
What?
- Only she knows.

108
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:17,528
l forgot...
Let me get you a drink.

109
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,302
Don't bother
- l'll get it...

110
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:25,268
Not you. There's no dearth
of servants in this house.

111
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:29,067
Let her. lt's time she learns
the ways of this family.

112
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:31,744
After all she has to
come here as a bride.

113
00:17:33,984 --> 00:17:37,750
You look lovely.
Who's it all for?

114
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,628
What was Sakina saying?
- The truth.

115
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,771
"l mean, what did she say?"
- That you wanted to speak to me.

116
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,368
"Congratulations, Gopal."
- Thanks

117
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,109
You look lovely.

118
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,771
Sunder hasn't come yet.
Strange fellow!

119
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:10,782
Did you speak?

120
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:14,783
How could l? There're too
many people around.

121
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:18,795
Your friend Sunder isn't here?
- Must be on his way.

122
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:31,274
Here he is!

123
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:37,277
Can't you ever be on time?
Not even today?

124
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,811
l can't hide things from you.

125
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:41,880
l have only one suit.

126
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:44,812
My pants were torn and
l had to sew them.

127
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:47,955
l wanted to dress well.
"Radha's coming, you know."

128
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:49,551
ls she here?
- Yes

129
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,225
Where's she?
- There.

130
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,355
Tell Gopal everything
you want to.

131
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,827
"How can l, with that fool"
hovering around him?

132
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,505
"Stay close, Gopal."

133
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:08,239
My heart could stop beating...
And my pulse?

134
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,574
Go and say 'hi'.
l'll join you later.

135
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:12,039
Must l?
- Go on!

136
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,623
Oh no! He's coming here.

137
00:19:21,892 --> 00:19:23,826
l'll take care of Sunder.
Go and find Gopal.

138
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,018
"Welcome, Sunder."

139
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,526
Say MlSTER Sunder.
l'm suited and booted

140
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,665
Right. MlSTER Sunder.
We don't meet nowadays.

141
00:19:34,037 --> 00:19:36,005
Quite right. We hardly meet.

142
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,410
Talk to Sakina. l'll be back.

143
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,139
So talk to me.

144
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:50,882
About what?
- About Radha.

145
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,682
Radha? Go ahead.

146
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:58,819
l'm told you love her.
- ls it public knowledge?

147
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:01,825
May l suggest something?
- Please do.

148
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:03,892
Ask Radha what she wants.

149
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:09,901
Suppose you both want
different things?

150
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,902
That's why l'm here - to
confess my feelings.

151
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:16,573
l'll ask her today.

152
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,915
Don't worry.
Will you have a drink?

153
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:20,244
Excuse me.

154
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:24,648
Do you see how different
Sunder and Gopal are?

155
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,253
"One, a worthy son of"
a worthy father.

156
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,924
He's a lawyer and will
be a judge one day.

157
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,462
The other one's a
good-for-nothing.

158
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:37,264
And he comes here today
like a band-master.

159
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:42,067
"Say whatever you will,"
but Sunder is a gem of a boy.

160
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:46,432
"Which is why, Captain,"
he's my dearest friend.

161
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,673
You're always biased
against him.

162
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,351
Never mind his appearance.
He's the life and soul of any party.

163
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,090
What is it?

164
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,489
Did you meet Sunder?

165
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:08,228
l came to say something to you.

166
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:11,967
l've never dared to say it
to you before.

167
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:15,463
"The Judge wants you, son."
Come on.

168
00:21:15,805 --> 00:21:16,635
l'll be back.

169
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:33,990
Your friend isn't eating.

170
00:21:34,557 --> 00:21:37,583
"Sunder, won't you eat?"
- l can't. l'll choke.

171
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:38,792
Why?

172
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:45,596
Not unless l speak to her.
l'm incapable of anything.

173
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,266
How will you speak?
Will you play?

174
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:51,607
Yes. l'll play and sing.

175
00:21:51,908 --> 00:21:54,138
Very good. Music gives
life meaning.

176
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:58,676
"Which is why, a heart that"
"loves, will speak in song."

177
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,950
Wonderful.
- Such poetry.

178
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:03,344
Then develop the poem.
- Go on.

179
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:12,019
Every heart that loves
will speak out in song.

180
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:16,564
and a lover in a crowd
will stand out.

181
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:19,032
Wonderful!

182
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:39,045
"A heart that loves"
"will speak out in song"

183
00:22:44,594 --> 00:22:48,587
"A lover in a crowd"
"will stand out"

184
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:18,289
"Having stolen my heart,"
"you hide yourself from me"

185
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:27,097
"Though my love is unrequited,"
"my feelings for you abide"

186
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:39,109
"This is what love is about;"
"although you do not know it"

187
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,610
"The candle-flame that burns"
"will draw the moth to it"

188
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:37,838
"Forgotten memories"
"of our happy childhood"

189
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:46,180
"come to trouble"
"my dreams at night"

190
00:24:47,484 --> 00:24:51,511
"l've never dared"
"to speak my heart"

191
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:57,524
"Though countries seasons"
"have come and gone"

192
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:03,328
"When will these eyes"
"be brave enough to speak?"

193
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:07,362
"A lover in a crowd"
"will stand out"

194
00:25:56,085 --> 00:26:05,255
"Everyone has spoken..."
"but l cannot speak my heart"

195
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:13,263
"The story of my heart"
"shall remain forever untold"

196
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:25,543
"Having united two hearts,"
"this outsider will leave"

197
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,284
"A lover in a crowd will be"
"recognised, without doubt"

198
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:58,312
"Sakina, won't you dance?"

199
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,845
Forget about me. Ask Radha.

200
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:12,377
You wouldn't know how much
l have waited for you.

201
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:47,214
l'm writing this to
answer your question.

202
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:50,893
But l don't know myself
what the answer is.

203
00:28:51,127 --> 00:28:53,891
Shameless! Reading
another's letter?

204
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:58,096
Another? So you've discarded
all of us for him?

205
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:01,437
Never mind. l'll deliver
the letter for you.

206
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,705
As if l couldn't do it myself.
- So why did you keep it here?

207
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:11,241
l thought l'd give it to him.
- Really?

208
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,314
Now wait...

209
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:22,123
l'm taking this paper along.
l'll send you the draft notice.

210
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:26,121
Mr lawyer... could you
come upstairs please?

211
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,589
Sakina's calling you!
Let me accompany you...

212
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:36,803
Where are you going?

213
00:29:36,973 --> 00:29:40,465
Sakina called him.
- lt was Radha; not Sakina.

214
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,278
l'm not bothered. l'm going too...
- Why not?

215
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:49,474
"The army captain, aren't you?"
Come on now!

216
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:50,810
All right... let's go.

217
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:55,482
Did you call me?
- Not me. lt was Radha.

218
00:29:56,526 --> 00:29:58,494
"Well, Radha?"

219
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:13,502
Tell him!
- What's bothering you?

220
00:30:14,076 --> 00:30:16,374
"ln that case, l'll tell him."

221
00:30:16,746 --> 00:30:17,838
"Actually, Radha has..."

222
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:30,047
Looks like you've been joking.
And l got taken in.

223
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:36,054
You didn't give him
"the letter, Radha."

224
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:42,601
What's the hurry?
l will give it to him.

225
00:30:42,905 --> 00:30:47,205
He's sitting downstairs.
- He's leaving!

226
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:49,067
l'll give it to him.
C'mon!

227
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:02,547
My God!

228
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:05,356
What do we do now?
- Deliver the letter?

229
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,104
Hurry up.

230
00:31:25,548 --> 00:31:27,243
"Coming, father."

231
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:33,588
"Come, let's go. lf father"
"comes up, it's the end."

232
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:55,408
lt's in Hindi.

233
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:59,206
My teacher always said one
should learn Hindi.

234
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,076
l wish l had learnt it.

235
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:31,908
Gopal! l've got it!
- Got what?

236
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,639
A priceless treasure!
"That is, this letter."

237
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:36,652
Letter?
- Yes! lt will decide my fate

238
00:32:36,953 --> 00:32:40,787
"l'm at your mercy, Gopal!"
- What are you doing?

239
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:43,784
Only you can read and
tell me my fate

240
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,859
"Tell me, friend, if l'm"
on the Everest or in the hell?

241
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,798
What does it say?

242
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,333
Beloved...

243
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:58,674
Beloved?

244
00:33:07,516 --> 00:33:09,541
Say it again.
- Beloved.

245
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:13,144
"Take this cup away,"
for l am drunk.

246
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:18,686
What kind of a joke is this?
- You won't understand. Read on

247
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,496
ln your eyes l have seen a question.
Am l right?

248
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:29,495
Absolutely! Read on

249
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:32,372
l am writing to answer
your question

250
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:34,832
"Go and, give me my answer!"

251
00:33:35,544 --> 00:33:38,707
"The answer is, l don't know"
what my answer is

252
00:33:39,048 --> 00:33:43,178
l dream of the things
l would tell you

253
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,713
"But l stand before you,"
and my tongue is tied

254
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,046
This is an ancient story...

255
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:49,324
that has inspired poets

256
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:54,927
Maybe this is love

257
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:56,993
"Yours, Radha"

258
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:05,003
My? Radha?

259
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:12,145
"Hold me Gopal, ere l fall"

260
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:15,411
"What's melodrama is this, Sunder?"
- This is love

261
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:19,687
This thing called love

262
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:27,418
ls a river of fire
that drowns the lover

263
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,027
l've seen my share of
drowning lovers

264
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,894
Happens only in poetry.

265
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:38,167
Have you ever been in love?
- Yes

266
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:43,705
With whom?
- Radha.

267
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,913
ls there only one
Radha in the world?

268
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:58,260
Which other Radha?

269
00:34:58,627 --> 00:35:05,055
There was one Radha.
She was Lord Krishna's beloved

270
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:17,472
Oh... that Radha?

271
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:21,477
"For a moment, l almost died"

272
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:27,616
"Look, my hands have gone cold."
My blood seems to have turned to ice

273
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:35,629
l'm madly in love with Radha!
l can't live without her

274
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:46,773
"But believe me, if you were in love"
"with my Radha, l would've given her up"

275
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:51,376
lt'd break my heart. But l'd sacrifice
my love for friendship

276
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:19,465
What are you lost in?

277
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:23,209
l'm right here with you

278
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:27,141
l was thinking...
- You think more than you do

279
00:36:28,784 --> 00:36:29,614
"Tell me, what do l do?"

280
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:33,878
"You just do what l say,"
and no arguments

281
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:37,487
"All right, no arguments."
"- First, we go boating tomorrow"

282
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,021
"Yes, it's a Sunday"

283
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:40,293
But l have work

284
00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:42,621
Can't you give a day for me?
"- For you, l'd even give up my life"

285
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,700
Then give your life.
Come with me

286
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,373
Pick up the phone

287
00:36:57,813 --> 00:37:03,979
Dial a number

288
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,717
This is Radha's number.
- Right. Tell her that...

289
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:10,115
you're going boating tomorrow

290
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:14,528
"Hello, Captain. Gopal here."
- You pick up Radha at three...

291
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:18,058
How are you?
- Doesn't matter!

292
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:22,333
"Captain, tomorrow being a Sunday,"
we're going boating

293
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:27,934
Very well. Radha will come too

294
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:34,548
Gopal called. He has invited us
to go boating with him tomorrow

295
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,284
Us?
- And Radha too

296
00:37:39,455 --> 00:37:41,616
Radha too? Or Radha only?

297
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:45,353
l don't know... but l'm going!
"- But of course, you won't"

298
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:48,630
"Leave her alone. For her, it has"
just begun. Let it happen

299
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:55,028
What better a match for Radha?

300
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:59,501
"Now, how would l know all that?"
- How would you? All you know...

301
00:37:59,942 --> 00:38:07,906
"is that in 1916, you were a Captain."
- Was l not?

302
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:16,852
Big party?
- No. Small party. For two

303
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,720
Get lost

304
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:29,001
Radha sits here

305
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:32,002
Here's Gopal

306
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:36,736
And here l am

307
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,545
Radha of the intoxicating eyes

308
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:50,157
"And Gopal, the friend in need"

309
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:53,891
"My friend, and my lover"

310
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,507
ls this any time to come?
l've been waiting all my life

311
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:20,388
Did you invite Sunder too?
- He's the one who invited us

312
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:23,985
The phone call?
- He made me call you

313
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,452
What're you waiting for?
Come along

314
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:38,131
How are you Radha?

315
00:39:42,778 --> 00:39:43,540
l hear you've bought a boat?

316
00:39:43,846 --> 00:39:45,074
Yes. l'm sailing today.
lt's a sight

317
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:48,212
lt's a lovely boat
- Show me

318
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:52,284
"Go on Gopal, take a look"
- l'm coming too

319
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:57,751
Where are you off to?
l'm showing you my boat. Come

320
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:03,763
Who are you looking at? Gopal?
- No...

321
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:08,560
Mothing wrong. Not a friend like him
in the whole world

322
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:12,098
"When l'm in pain, he cries"

323
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,509
"When l'm happy, he rejoices."
Like yesterday

324
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,438
What happened yesterday?
- Read your letter

325
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:19,371
"You read it, too?"
"- No, Gopal did"

326
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:27,653
Gopal and l share all our secrets.
"Nice, isn't it?"

327
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:28,721
Where's your boat?

328
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:40,529
How is it?

329
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,131
Such a small one?

330
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:48,337
How many can sit in it?
- Two. You and l

331
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:53,808
"Two's a pair, three is a crowd,"
and four makes a gang of thieves

332
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:57,683
Which is the pair?

333
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,649
There's only one pair. You and l.
l'm right. Am l not? Tell me

334
00:41:08,397 --> 00:41:10,831
How do you like my boat?
- Beautiful

335
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,493
"Come over, then"

336
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:17,031
Radha won't sit in your rotten boat.
- Then will she sit in your tub?

337
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:22,505
She who sails with me
sits in my heart

338
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:31,853
That's a bloody lorry.
- She's a nymphet

339
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,388
Nymphet? She's a paper boat.
And those girls are paper dolls

340
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,987
Don't you show off.
Take that junk out of the waters

341
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:48,467
"He puts a lorry in the water,"
and he goes begging for passengers

342
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:50,805
Good riddance!

343
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:02,077
So what were you saying?

344
00:42:05,521 --> 00:42:09,423
Can you say how deep the lake is?
- Maybe 20 or 30 feet

345
00:42:11,126 --> 00:42:15,358
ls there anything deeper?
- Why not? The ocean

346
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:21,229
Deeper than the ocean?
- l don't know

347
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:27,508
"Your eyes, Radha, your eyes."
Let me drown in them

348
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,246
"Sunder, this is what l don't like. You"
always make a joke out of everything

349
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:40,455
"Sometimes, you're fun, but... l know"
you're good at heart. And l like you.

350
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,523
But everything has limits and
sometimes you cross the limit

351
00:42:46,828 --> 00:42:50,855
"Tell me then, what are my limits?"

352
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,599
l don't know.
- Tell me Radha! What are my limits?

353
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:57,204
l don't know!
"- Tell me, what are the limits?"

354
00:42:57,472 --> 00:42:58,769
l don't know! l don't know!

355
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:31,029
"Oh, my beloved..."

356
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:41,373
"Oh my beloved"

357
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:22,414
"To reach your heart"
"is my only goal"

358
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:34,626
"There is no corner in my life..."

359
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,625
"that you do not invade"

360
00:46:10,298 --> 00:46:15,998
"Why are you angry?"
"Why so sad?"

361
00:46:17,439 --> 00:46:23,867
"There is no need, for our hearts"
"shall know union"

362
00:47:05,086 --> 00:47:11,047
"l shall take you in the"
"circle of my arms"

363
00:47:12,227 --> 00:47:18,598
"l shall carry you away, someday"

364
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:36,409
"Oh, my beloved"

365
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:43,818
"To reach your heart"
"is my only goal"

366
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,140
Radha? Gopal here

367
00:48:37,245 --> 00:48:39,543
ls the Captain at home?
- No

368
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:41,139
And your mother?

369
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:47,618
"She's out, too. Can't you tell me?"
- l'm coming this evening to see them

370
00:48:48,924 --> 00:48:51,950
Tell them it's important.
We have to discuss something

371
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:56,630
Discuss?
- Yes. About you

372
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:59,161
About me?

373
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,974
"Sakina, do you know"
who called? Gopal

374
00:49:11,413 --> 00:49:14,974
He's coming to meet father
about something important

375
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:19,248
About me. What could it be?

376
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,657
"Tell me, Sakina"

377
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:29,656
"He'll say, l don't like Radha!"
She's ugly and she's foolish

378
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,523
Marry her off to Sunder

379
00:49:35,704 --> 00:49:39,663
Don't you ever say that again!
Don't even joke about it

380
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:56,217
Serve the drinks and leave. Girls
mustn't be present on such ocassions

381
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:58,216
"Why not, Ma?"

382
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:02,693
He won't be able to talk freely

383
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:07,969
Be seated

384
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:14,698
How are you?
- Fine. And you?

385
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:16,366
"Fine, thank you"

386
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:22,374
How are you?
"- Fine, thank you"

387
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,314
And your mother?
"- Fine, thank you"

388
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:43,861
How are you?

389
00:50:45,206 --> 00:50:48,403
"Fine, thank you. And you?"

390
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:51,412
"Fine, thank you"

391
00:51:15,804 --> 00:51:16,771
You... here?

392
00:51:22,577 --> 00:51:25,375
What madness is this? Why did you
have to scale the wall?

393
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:30,717
For you l could wade through
"a river of fire, the sea of death"

394
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:34,916
What kind of a joke is this?
"Sunder, please go away"

395
00:51:35,423 --> 00:51:36,117
"But, why?"

396
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:40,986
"Downstairs, they're discussing"
something important. About me

397
00:51:41,162 --> 00:51:43,062
l know

398
00:51:43,498 --> 00:51:46,467
Gopal is here.
- Naturally. Who else do l have?

399
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:50,263
"Oh, why don't you understand?"
Go away now

400
00:51:51,439 --> 00:51:56,809
Till death do we part
You look beautiful

401
00:51:57,846 --> 00:52:02,806
"l tell you again, Sunder"
is a wonderful match

402
00:52:03,518 --> 00:52:07,750
You expect me to give my Radha away
to that oaf?

403
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:15,495
"He has neither education, nor wealth"
How will he maintain my Radha?

404
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:20,096
"lf someone asks what he does,"
what am l to say?

405
00:52:20,735 --> 00:52:25,365
That he left the Air Force
to join a flying club?

406
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,034
No way

407
00:52:28,143 --> 00:52:32,375
Marriage will make Sunder
a responsible man.

408
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:38,444
He's a gem of a person.
- But l am no jeweller

409
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,711
l'm sorry to be refusing you

410
00:52:42,223 --> 00:52:47,354
l know you're his friend and
you've come here for his sake

411
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:49,388
But l'm helpless

412
00:52:50,565 --> 00:52:53,864
May l suggest something?
- Yes?

413
00:52:54,502 --> 00:52:57,403
We'd be willing to let
Radha marry you

414
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:02,877
Me?

415
00:53:06,381 --> 00:53:10,545
Consider it
- l can never

416
00:53:12,253 --> 00:53:16,417
Are we so lowly?
- l didn't mean that

417
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:17,892
There must be a reason

418
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:23,762
ls Radha unworthy?
- What are you saying?

419
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,898
The man who gets to marry her
will be very lucky

420
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:31,830
Then what's your objection?
- Objection?

421
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:40,172
Not a matter of objection.
A matter of obligation

422
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:44,646
"l'm just as helpless,"
as you are

423
00:53:46,487 --> 00:53:47,715
"Out of my way, Sunder"

424
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:50,915
How can l? My fate
is to be decided today

425
00:53:51,226 --> 00:53:55,526
"Then, hear me out! l don't like you."
Have you ever seen your face?

426
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:04,930
l see it now. ln your eyes.

427
00:54:06,107 --> 00:54:07,472
And it looks all right

428
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:11,770
"No, it doesn't! A man must"
be more than just a funster

429
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:15,208
What must he be?
- Let me go

430
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:19,952
Tell me what a man must be
and l'll become that

431
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:21,950
l don't know!

432
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:37,628
Don't tell Radha that
Gopal came for Sunder

433
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:40,973
Just say he came to talk
of marriage...

434
00:54:41,276 --> 00:54:43,301
and we said we'd
think it over

435
00:54:43,911 --> 00:54:46,812
One can't say 'yes' at the
very beginning

436
00:54:48,016 --> 00:54:53,818
l'm sure Gopal will be back
to say that he'll marry her

437
00:55:07,368 --> 00:55:12,465
"l tried everything, Sunder, but..."
"- Say no more, Gopal"

438
00:55:13,308 --> 00:55:16,334
"Believe me, l tried"
- Why are you repeating it?

439
00:55:17,045 --> 00:55:22,278
l don't want you to think that...
- Does it remain to be said that...

440
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:24,280
you'd leave no stone unturned for me?

441
00:55:27,322 --> 00:55:31,281
l have to become something.
Radha said that too

442
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:36,497
A man must make more of himself
than just a clown

443
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:40,699
l will. l'll make myself worthy

444
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:51,578
"Don't be sad. Come on, smile"
Keep smiling. Always

445
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,642
You have a beautiful smile

446
00:55:56,818 --> 00:56:00,982
Only Radha's smile can match
the beauty of your smile

447
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:06,583
Her smile is as radiant as
all the sunflowers in the world

448
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:11,595
"Well, then..."

449
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:25,544
Where are you taking me?
"- Come with me, l'll explain"

450
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:31,613
What is the matter? Where are we
headed? l don't understand this

451
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:34,618
You'll come to know

452
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:58,941
"So boys, you have been briefed about"
your mission.

453
00:56:59,747 --> 00:57:04,377
Only one more thing l've to tell you.
Don't forget...

454
00:57:04,685 --> 00:57:08,382
that you are flying
the lndian Air Force

455
00:57:08,623 --> 00:57:12,787
And the Air Force has full faith
"in your courage, and your patriotism"

456
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:43,416
Sunder... you... here?

457
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:52,430
What's this Sunder? This uniform...
these planes? What's all this?

458
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:57,695
lt was you who told me that there's
more to life than being just a clown

459
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:00,440
A man must make something of himself

460
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:05,436
"This is an Air Force uniform,"
and l fly that airplane

461
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:09,448
l'm flying off today.
- Where?

462
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:13,117
l'm not allowed to reveal that

463
00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:20,185
"Just a minute, Gopal"

464
00:58:24,499 --> 00:58:27,730
l'm leaving. l don't know
when l'll return

465
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:30,937
"Before l leave, l want"
to tell you something

466
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:32,732
"Go ahead, Sunder"

467
00:58:33,474 --> 00:58:38,537
You're everything to me...
"mother, father, brother and friend"

468
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,810
While l am gone no third man
must come between Radha and me

469
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:45,552
Say you promise

470
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:51,891
"Tell me Gopal, you promise"
"l promise, Sunder"

471
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:58,365
lt's another matter if l die
- Die?

472
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:02,759
"What are you saying, Sunder?"

473
00:59:03,938 --> 00:59:07,135
"l won't die, Radha. l won't die."

474
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:12,235
l'll come back to you... for you

475
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:14,433
"Sunder, listen..."

476
01:00:18,879 --> 01:00:22,975
"Sunder, listen to me"
l have something to tell you

477
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:31,786
Don't get the wrong idea
"l don't love you, Sunder"

478
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,592
l don't love you!
"Take care, Sunder"

479
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:11,357
l won't die Radha

480
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,302
l'll come back to you... for you

481
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:50,228
"Gopal, l can face every danger"
in this world

482
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:54,404
What l can't fight is the darkness
in my mind...

483
01:01:54,575 --> 01:01:56,668
which seem to grow when
l don't hear from Radha

484
01:01:56,977 --> 01:02:01,243
A darkness that not all the light
in the universe can quell

485
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:05,683
Go to Radha today.
Tell her to write to me

486
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,088
"Else, l'll go mad"

487
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:19,696
Go to Radha today.
Tell her to write to me

488
01:02:20,601 --> 01:02:22,694
"Else, l'll go mad"

489
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:28,705
"Remember, how we used to play family"
when we were kids?

490
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:32,438
"You and l, and Sunder"

491
01:02:33,147 --> 01:02:36,981
You would insist that
l stay with you

492
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:40,052
"And Sunder used to say,"
Radha will live with me

493
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:46,187
He says that even today.
- Even today?

494
01:02:46,627 --> 01:02:50,119
Why haven't you answered
his letters?

495
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,463
l just haven't.
- Why not?

496
01:02:57,638 --> 01:03:03,474
"Child's play is one thing, and making"
a family is quite something else

497
01:03:04,712 --> 01:03:08,739
"For me, Sunder is no more"
than a childhood friend

498
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:50,786
lf you had a woman's heart
you'd know my feelings

499
01:03:51,492 --> 01:03:52,720
What are your feelings?

500
01:03:54,094 --> 01:03:56,528
l love someone else.
- Whom?

501
01:03:58,098 --> 01:03:59,065
You

502
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:01,926
Are you mad?
- No. But you're driving me mad

503
01:04:02,102 --> 01:04:06,801
Even hearing this is a sin for me!
- Then l shall pay for your sins

504
01:04:07,107 --> 01:04:11,373
"But tell me, for once,"
have you never loved me?

505
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,377
No!
- You're lying! Lying

506
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:16,807
Your relationship with Sunder
has always silenced you

507
01:04:17,051 --> 01:04:20,543
"Were it not for my friendship,"
l would've told you something today

508
01:04:20,754 --> 01:04:25,088
"l plead with you, tell me"
what you want to say

509
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:29,023
l want to talk of Sunder
who's battling death

510
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:32,828
"Day and night, he lives"
in the shadow of death

511
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,567
He has only one image
before his eyes

512
01:04:36,737 --> 01:04:38,102
Yours

513
01:04:39,607 --> 01:04:43,907
"lf he wanted to suffer, why"
did he have to choose you?

514
01:04:44,945 --> 01:04:49,848
l have enough pain of my own.
Why did l choose you?

515
01:05:30,658 --> 01:05:31,625
Kishan...

516
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:36,960
What is it?

517
01:05:37,998 --> 01:05:42,901
A letter. ln Hindi. From Radha.
Read it out for me

518
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:45,900
Dear Sunder...

519
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:52,768
Take care of yourself.
You said you'd return to me

520
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,981
l wait for that day.
"Yours, Radha"

521
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:02,919
Mine. Radha

522
01:06:05,626 --> 01:06:11,656
You're lucky to have Radha's love
and Gopal's friendship

523
01:06:29,383 --> 01:06:30,577
"Yours, Radha"

524
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,687
The teacher was right.
The knowledge of Hindi is necessary

525
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,587
"Sing something else, won't you?"
You're always singing that sad song

526
01:07:18,632 --> 01:07:21,726
There's much in life
to be happy about

527
01:07:22,102 --> 01:07:26,334
You have reason to be happy. Your
girlfriend didn't break your heart

528
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:31,205
Your friend didn't betray you.
"Else, you too would've said it too"

529
01:07:31,445 --> 01:07:35,074
"My friend, is a friend no more."
"My love, is my love no more"

530
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:38,276
"My life, l trust you not"

531
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,027
Nothing can be done.
Our men are besieged

532
01:07:54,468 --> 01:07:58,427
We can't even send them supplies

533
01:07:58,939 --> 01:08:00,031
Why not?

534
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,438
The planes can't reach them

535
01:08:02,743 --> 01:08:04,438
The opening to the valley
is narrow...

536
01:08:04,678 --> 01:08:07,772
and every inch is being held
by the enemy

537
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:12,510
Give me permission sir.
Let me try

538
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,786
You're a bomber pilot.
This needs a Dakota

539
01:08:16,323 --> 01:08:19,121
No job is too small in times of war.
"Give me the permission, sir."

540
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:22,254
You're asking for death

541
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:26,061
Death for myself.
Life for my brother soldiers

542
01:08:26,567 --> 01:08:31,664
"Give me a chance, sir. l promised"
someone l'd do something worthy.

543
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:33,337
Let me go

544
01:13:42,749 --> 01:13:47,118
l told him he was asking
for death

545
01:13:48,722 --> 01:13:54,592
"He said, it would mean life"
for his brother soldiers

546
01:13:54,761 --> 01:13:58,788
Just what l feared
What a man he was

547
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,802
We regret to inform you that
"your friend, Flt. Lt. Sunder Khanna..."

548
01:14:06,039 --> 01:14:08,872
met his death while
fighting the enemy

549
01:15:03,964 --> 01:15:07,456
This award is presented
posthumously...

550
01:15:07,767 --> 01:15:10,861
"to Flt. Lt. Sunder Khanna,"
35 Squadron...

551
01:15:11,104 --> 01:15:16,007
who risked his life to drop supplies
to soldiers at the front

552
01:15:16,176 --> 01:15:18,474
He gave his life to filfill
his mission

553
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:25,040
"ln the hour of crisis, he commanded]"
his co-pilot to bail out...

554
01:15:25,252 --> 01:15:28,221
but he battled death as he
continued to drop supplies

555
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:33,883
Flt. Lt. Khanna has upheld the highest
ideals of the Air Force

556
01:15:34,094 --> 01:15:38,827
"His courage, his spirit of sacrifice"
and his sense of duty

557
01:15:38,999 --> 01:15:42,901
will go down in the annals of the
lndian Air Force in golden letters

558
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:47,236
For selfless service
to the country...

559
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,070
the Government of lndia presents
this award to Flt. Lt. Khanna

560
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:55,780
Flt. Lt. Khanna's dear friend

561
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:21,927
l won't die. l'll come back...

562
01:17:22,636 --> 01:17:24,866
to you... for you

563
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:55,695
His words still echo in my ears

564
01:17:56,936 --> 01:18:02,636
"l'll return, Radha. l will."
To you... for you

565
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:09,780
What a man he was.
So full of love

566
01:18:11,217 --> 01:18:15,381
He'd sacrifice his life
for a friend...

567
01:18:15,689 --> 01:18:17,384
and the world
for his beloved

568
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,717
While leaving he entrusted
something to me

569
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:23,924
His beloved?

570
01:18:28,768 --> 01:18:32,670
You knew?
l told him...

571
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:40,672
not to misunderstand...
that l didn't love him

572
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:52,414
"l loved you, Gopal..."
l love you

573
01:18:55,528 --> 01:18:59,294
Tell me the truth.
Don't you love me?

574
01:19:00,567 --> 01:19:04,765
"You do, don't you?"

575
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:17,358
"Do l write"My beloved"?"

576
01:22:18,665 --> 01:22:22,624
"Do l write"My Beauty"?"

577
01:22:23,937 --> 01:22:28,499
"Or do l say"My sweetheart"?"

578
01:22:30,009 --> 01:22:41,648
l'm at a loss
What should l write?

579
01:22:46,693 --> 01:22:47,921
Let go of my dress!
- Give me my letter

580
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:50,652
"Let go, l say"
"- First, my letter"

581
01:22:51,297 --> 01:22:52,264
Why?

582
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,656
Aren't you ashamed of reading
someone else's love-letter?

583
01:22:54,968 --> 01:22:57,198
Aren't you ashamed of writing
love-letters?

584
01:23:02,542 --> 01:23:10,347
"Do not be angry"
"when you read my letter"

585
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:18,221
"For you are my life,"
"you are my very own"

586
01:23:54,961 --> 01:24:02,333
"l could call you the moon,"
"but the moon is flawed"

587
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:18,013
"l could call the sun,"
"but the sun is not perfect"

588
01:24:18,651 --> 01:24:25,750
"The only thing left to say"
"is that l love you"

589
01:25:01,994 --> 01:25:09,628
"You're as pure as the Ganga,"
"as pristine as the Yamuna"

590
01:25:17,777 --> 01:25:25,081
"You're so close to my heart"
"that you are my very being"

591
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:34,083
"l fear that l might die"
"waiting for you to be mine"

592
01:25:37,196 --> 01:25:44,568
"Do not be angry"
"when you read my letter"

593
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:52,107
"For you are my life,"
"you are my very own"

594
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:27,804
Gopal! My son! My darling!

595
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,769
Come with me.
- What is the matter?

596
01:27:29,976 --> 01:27:34,936
Take your father's blessings
What's happening?

597
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,773
Do it. Pay him your obeisances.
- But what's it about?

598
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,885
"Ask for your father's blessings,"
Mr Magistrate

599
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:44,213
Magistrate?
- You've become a magistrate

600
01:27:48,661 --> 01:27:51,221
May you live long.
Ask for his blessings

601
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:55,625
Your son has fulfilled
your wish

602
01:27:56,469 --> 01:27:59,961
"Son, vow that you shall"
always do justice

603
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:07,838
"l vow, l shall always do justice"
"- First of all, give me justice"

604
01:28:08,014 --> 01:28:11,711
What?
- Get a daughter-in-law for me

605
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:16,920
As you wish. Have l ever disobeyed
you? Go ahead and do what you want

606
01:28:17,223 --> 01:28:20,454
Then l'll go to her house
to finalise the match right today

607
01:28:20,693 --> 01:28:23,924
"But, who's the girl?"
- As if you don't know?

608
01:28:24,163 --> 01:28:28,259
How would l know? l practise law.
l don't chase girls

609
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:31,532
Radha
- Who? Radha?

610
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:37,266
"Oh, well..."
- Why? Don't you like her?

611
01:28:38,577 --> 01:28:45,608
How does that matter? A noose is
"a noose, be it of silk or cotton"

612
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:48,686
l know everything

613
01:28:55,061 --> 01:28:59,691
"When you read my letter,"
do not be angry

614
01:29:00,599 --> 01:29:05,298
"For you are my life,"
my very own

615
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:33,721
What are you staring at?
My magistrateo

616
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:43,322
"That l am, for others. But for you,"
l will always remain the same.

617
01:31:44,132 --> 01:31:46,862
Your willing prisoner
- Prisoner?

618
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:55,331
My mother will go to see
your mother very soon

619
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,607
Why?

620
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:07,482
"She'll say, "You have a queen"
"in your house, and l have a slave"

621
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,955
Then the queen will buy this slave

622
01:32:14,129 --> 01:32:17,895
And your mother will take home
a devoted maid

623
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:45,656
Gopal! Come here

624
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:55,734
l've been waiting for you.
"- What is it, Ma?"

625
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:58,732
l nearly went mad with joy
when l heard the news

626
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:01,398
What news?
- You'll be overjoyed to hear it

627
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:06,413
Read this. Sunder is alive

628
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:11,010
God be thanked!
What else could l want?

629
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:14,087
You've become a magistrate.
l'm getting a daughter-in-law

630
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:18,025
"And now, God has given me"
Sunder back too

631
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:21,421
l'm going to the temple.
l must thank The Gods

632
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:58,192
"l didn't know this, Sunder"

633
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:06,004
You don't know what a terrible thing
l was about to do

634
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:13,077
"l was about to betray you,"
usurp your place

635
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:19,077
"Had it happened, how would l"
have faced you?

636
01:34:21,756 --> 01:34:24,748
What man would've trusted
a friend then?

637
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:28,492
What man would swear
by friendship then?

638
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:34,757
"Thank God, you're alive"

639
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:51,780
"Did you hear, Gopal?"
Sunder is alive!

640
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:57,117
l'm so happy l can't tell you

641
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:06,192
How could we have got
married without him?

642
01:35:06,401 --> 01:35:10,735
Our wedding would've
been incomplete

643
01:35:10,972 --> 01:35:13,805
Hurry! lt's time for the train

644
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,804
Get up! Move

645
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:20,305
l'm not going.
- Why?

646
01:35:23,251 --> 01:35:27,085
lf he doesn't see you with me at
"the station, what will he think?"

647
01:35:28,122 --> 01:35:33,219
That's what l'm wondering. lf he sees
"you with me, what will he say?"

648
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:42,829
"He'll say, "Congratulations Gopal,"
"Radha is yours"

649
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:45,833
And what do l say?

650
01:35:49,344 --> 01:35:53,781
"Say, "Meet Radha"
"My Radha"

651
01:35:58,019 --> 01:36:03,855
He's your best friend. He must be
the first to know of our marriage

652
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:12,859
He should be the last to know.
"ln fact, he shouldn't know at all"

653
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:23,473
"Who knows what dreams, what desires"
he comes with?

654
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:26,878
What dreams?
What desires?

655
01:36:29,584 --> 01:36:30,881
Dreams about you

656
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:40,220
Now my mother will never
go to meet yours

657
01:36:43,064 --> 01:36:44,156
Why not?

658
01:36:44,932 --> 01:36:49,232
"Why not, l ask you?"
- What would Sunder think?

659
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:54,037
What about what l think?
What will my parents think?

660
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:58,636
Sunder is my dearest friend

661
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:09,917
And l am to be sacrificed for
"your friendship... my life, my love"

662
01:37:13,628 --> 01:37:17,394
"First, l am sacrificing"
my own love and my happiness

663
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:21,059
"And next, l shall ask for yours"

664
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:27,004
l won't sacrifice myself!
l won't! Do you hear me?

665
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:31,673
Go away! Go away from here!

666
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:58,429
May The Lord preserve you!

667
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:02,293
We received your wire today

668
01:39:03,337 --> 01:39:05,635
lsn't Gopal here? Where is he?

669
01:39:19,353 --> 01:39:21,583
Mr Magistrate! How are you?

670
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:27,055
"How are you, Sunder?"
- See for yourself. All in one piece

671
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:35,063
l'm not an easy man to break.
- You've come at the right time

672
01:39:36,137 --> 01:39:40,073
We were so upset.
And look at you now

673
01:39:41,108 --> 01:39:43,474
Stand straight.
- What're you doing?

674
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:46,079
l'm casting away the evil eye

675
01:39:46,781 --> 01:39:53,152
Do it to Gopal instead. l'm tough.
l'd come back even from death

676
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:58,088
To meet Gopal.
- Death to your enemies

677
01:40:08,603 --> 01:40:10,764
What are you doing with the papers?

678
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:14,365
Here's a man back from the dead.
You can't have bigger news

679
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:17,366
And the dead man is sitting
right in front of you

680
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:20,445
Come off it

681
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:26,517
You're still the same
ebullient self

682
01:40:33,227 --> 01:40:36,128
"But you've changed, Gopal."
- What do you mean?

683
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:42,130
You aren't the Gopal l knew. You don't
even seem happy at that l've returned

684
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:45,267
l thought you'd go wild with joy

685
01:40:46,841 --> 01:40:51,005
What a thing to say? How can l not
be happy to have you back?

686
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:55,414
Maybe l'm just too old to
break out into a jig

687
01:41:00,121 --> 01:41:01,418
"Tell me, how's Radha?"

688
01:41:04,592 --> 01:41:06,560
She's well. Very well

689
01:41:09,597 --> 01:41:15,763
"Look, l still get the gooseflesh"
when l even think of Radha

690
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:26,571
"And my heart says, when she sings,"
let me play on

691
01:41:29,684 --> 01:41:33,586
Come Gopal. Let's go to Radha's place

692
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:37,452
There can be no hurdle now.
l've become worthy

693
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:42,924
Why not? She's been waiting for you

694
01:41:43,497 --> 01:41:45,863
See her...?
- l've things to do

695
01:41:47,301 --> 01:41:50,202
You haven't yet done the most
important thing in life!

696
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:53,405
What's that?
"- Falling in love, you fool"

697
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:55,939
l've been away for two years.
And what've you done in two years?

698
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:58,471
Couldn't you even
find yourself a Radha?

699
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:03,817
Shame on you

700
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:14,226
Yes. The good-for-nothing oaf. Sunder

701
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:23,963
"Janki, look who's here"
- Who is it?

702
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,974
Sunder! My son!

703
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,510
"Radha, look who's come home"

704
01:42:34,014 --> 01:42:34,981
Sit down

705
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,977
l cried so much for you

706
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:41,153
We got terrible news

707
01:43:08,149 --> 01:43:09,116
"How are you, Sunder?"

708
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:21,527
l promised l'd return.
See? l'm back

709
01:43:22,296 --> 01:43:23,388
All in one piece

710
01:43:25,633 --> 01:43:29,262
Why is everyone standing?
Sit down

711
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:31,233
l'll get some drinks

712
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:37,905
"Excuse me for a moment, please"

713
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:44,340
"l want to see, to feel, the one"
thing that didn't let me die

714
01:43:44,652 --> 01:43:46,711
We had heard...
- And it was true

715
01:43:47,822 --> 01:43:48,652
Death was certain

716
01:43:48,856 --> 01:43:55,352
My plane turned into a fireball.
l don't even know where l fell

717
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:59,556
For 2 years l was neither
dead nor alive

718
01:43:59,934 --> 01:44:07,500
Dead?
- Yes. Head injury. l lost my memory

719
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:09,865
l couldn't remember a thing

720
01:44:11,645 --> 01:44:14,580
l was moved from one hospital
to another

721
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:18,744
Do you know the first word l spoke
when l came around?

722
01:44:19,787 --> 01:44:21,914
"Your name Radha, your name"

723
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:25,281
Only your name stood between
me and my death

724
01:44:26,327 --> 01:44:30,263
A drowning man will clutch at
anything. l clung on to your name

725
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,433
"When l was sinking, drowning"
in the dark abyss of death...

726
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:35,534
l clung to your name...
your memories

727
01:44:38,405 --> 01:44:39,599
Do you know what saved me?

728
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:44,043
What?
- Your letter

729
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:47,941
My letter? But l didn't...
- Have you forgotten?

730
01:44:48,983 --> 01:44:50,109
You gave me the letter and
you asked me to post it

731
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:10,465
l read the letter
over and over again

732
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:13,037
l usually keep my wallet inside
my right pocket

733
01:45:13,274 --> 01:45:16,266
But your letter was in the wallet.
So l kept in in my left pocket...

734
01:45:16,443 --> 01:45:23,281
close to my heart. lt's as if
my death bounced off your letter

735
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:27,719
"Believe me Radha, l've crossed"
the river of no return...

736
01:45:27,888 --> 01:45:32,484
to come back to you.
"- Not the letter, Sunder"

737
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:36,152
That isn't what saved your life.
lt was her prayer

738
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:42,064
"And her unwavering love, that stood"
like a wall between you and your death

739
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:55,238
You're crying? Just because
you hear this?

740
01:45:55,616 --> 01:46:03,387
What's there to cry about?
"Here l am, in front of you. Alive"

741
01:46:05,225 --> 01:46:09,821
Here you are. With me.
Please don't cry

742
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:14,399
"Don't cry, Radha. Don't"

743
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:19,694
Death l've left behind.
"Ahead, life lies"

744
01:46:20,507 --> 01:46:27,538
A life to be lived together.
ln happiness. Please smile

745
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:33,878
Tell her to smile

746
01:46:47,668 --> 01:46:54,437
She couldn't even bear to hear it.
This is painful

747
01:46:55,809 --> 01:47:00,576
Her smiles give me life.
But her tears could kill me

748
01:47:04,551 --> 01:47:07,384
lf that is the way she broke down
after hearing my story...

749
01:47:07,554 --> 01:47:08,851
how she must've pined for me

750
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:11,925
How much Radha loves me

751
01:47:14,495 --> 01:47:15,928
"Yes, she loves you very much"

752
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:24,098
Still standing? Sit down.
Have something to eat

753
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:25,271
l must go now

754
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:30,142
But l'll come everyday.
"Say what, Gopal?"

755
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:42,948
Did you see how Sunder has changed?
And he looks so gallant in uniform

756
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:46,224
"An officer, after all. Like me."

757
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:53,066
Why hasn't Gopal's mother
spoken to us yet?

758
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:57,567
"Rather than jump to conclusions,"
we should speak to her first

759
01:47:57,838 --> 01:47:59,237
We must

760
01:48:03,911 --> 01:48:07,972
Ma
"- What is it, son?"

761
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,013
Please get me married. Fast

762
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:16,421
l'll go and see Radha's mother
- Don't go to Radha's mother

763
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:23,421
l'll even marry the ugliest girl
in the world

764
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:26,565
But don't mention Radha
ever again

765
01:48:29,036 --> 01:48:31,061
What's wrong with Radha?

766
01:48:31,939 --> 01:48:36,774
l don't like her anymore

767
01:48:37,044 --> 01:48:40,377
But consider the fact that
l have given my word

768
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:42,808
They didn't come to me.
l went to them asking for her

769
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:47,544
Because you said so. For your sake.
- Refuse them. For my sake

770
01:48:47,788 --> 01:48:50,586
Tell them that Gopal
is a changed man

771
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:52,692
Just make it clear

772
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:55,687
Captain?

773
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:02,424
l heard everything

774
01:49:03,971 --> 01:49:09,170
Please do not go by what he says.
He doesn't know what he's saying

775
01:49:09,676 --> 01:49:11,473
So speaks the boy's mother

776
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:13,980
You are girl's father

777
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:20,880
Will your daughter be happy
married to a man...

778
01:49:21,088 --> 01:49:21,850
who doesn't want her?

779
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:23,718
"Forgive me, but this is true"

780
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:31,057
l won't marry Radha.
Come what may

781
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:43,738
l didn't stay to be
insulted anymore

782
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:48,245
Naturally. Did they expect
you to beg?

783
01:49:49,216 --> 01:49:52,583
l'll confront Gopal.
l'll ask him

784
01:49:52,786 --> 01:49:53,980
Not Gopal. Meet Sunder

785
01:49:54,188 --> 01:49:57,351
He's no less.
He's an Air Force officer

786
01:49:57,624 --> 01:50:01,788
And he has always loved Radha

787
01:50:01,995 --> 01:50:06,364
"He even asked for her hand,"
but we refused

788
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:11,264
And what does he lack?
He's young and handsome

789
01:50:11,538 --> 01:50:15,599
Weddings must be don
with due dignity

790
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:23,581
What is this?
- My wedding invitation

791
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:27,580
You're a lucky man

792
01:50:29,223 --> 01:50:31,191
l have something for you too

793
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,389
"What's this, sir?"
- Your posting orders

794
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:36,251
Where am l being posted?

795
01:50:36,763 --> 01:50:38,321
Air Adviser's Office. London

796
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:43,235
So you can honeymoon in Europe

797
01:50:57,284 --> 01:50:59,275
Bring her quickly.
They're waiting

798
01:51:08,195 --> 01:51:09,025
"What's this, Radha?"

799
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:21,469
Nothing. Your joke has come true.
l'm marrying Sunder

800
01:51:31,652 --> 01:51:32,380
Wait. The knot's undone

801
01:51:36,056 --> 01:51:44,020
"Go on, Gopal. Tie it so tight"
that it never comes loose

802
01:53:12,352 --> 01:53:13,319
l am born anew

803
01:53:19,726 --> 01:53:22,320
l am entering a new life

804
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:28,864
"l have left my house, my home,"
far behind

805
01:53:30,771 --> 01:53:34,298
Now l want to forget everything

806
01:53:35,976 --> 01:53:39,309
l want to hold you
in my eyes forever

807
01:53:39,546 --> 01:53:41,741
ln my heart

808
01:53:47,621 --> 01:53:50,556
Are you praying to me already?
l'm still alive

809
01:53:51,792 --> 01:53:52,759
Promise me
- What madness is this?

810
01:53:52,926 --> 01:53:55,895
Keep me with yourself always.
- Get up. That isn't your place

811
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:59,792
"No, give me your word"
"- What are you doing, Radha? Get up"

812
01:54:08,241 --> 01:54:12,109
"Your place is in my eyes,"
in my heart

813
01:54:15,248 --> 01:54:18,411
Promise me you'll always stay by me

814
01:54:19,486 --> 01:54:22,387
Never let anyone come between us

815
01:54:22,556 --> 01:54:26,652
No one will

816
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,363
lsn't he handsome?

817
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:38,471
Our photographs look so lifeless
without his

818
01:54:40,307 --> 01:54:42,673
These two mean so much to me

819
01:54:42,843 --> 01:54:47,940
Gopal's friendship and your love
l can't live without either

820
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:57,222
What's this? Sadness?
On such a day?

821
01:54:59,526 --> 01:55:00,220
l'm smiling

822
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:06,726
You look lovely when you smile

823
01:55:09,536 --> 01:55:14,405
As though a million stars are
dancing with bells on their feet

824
01:55:18,211 --> 01:55:21,180
As if the Moon itself
sings of love

825
01:55:27,787 --> 01:55:33,919
You love me so much?
Yes

826
01:55:36,029 --> 01:55:38,190
You love me so much?

827
01:57:38,085 --> 01:57:39,052
What are you looking at?

828
01:57:40,421 --> 01:57:41,046
You

829
01:57:41,255 --> 01:57:46,158
Remember what l said?
l'd take Radha around the world

830
01:57:46,493 --> 01:57:51,590
"Someday, l'd take you away,"
and the world would see

831
01:59:10,277 --> 01:59:11,869
Where did it fall?

832
01:59:15,349 --> 01:59:16,646
What did you wish for?

833
01:59:18,185 --> 01:59:21,382
Happiness for you and
peace for myself

834
01:59:21,922 --> 01:59:23,651
You must make a wish too

835
01:59:25,025 --> 01:59:26,322
What could l wish for
when l have you?

836
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:34,295
l dare not ask God for more

837
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:05,082
Happy?
Very happy. And you?

838
02:02:42,089 --> 02:02:47,959
"l'm in Europe with Radha."
"lt's like being in Heaven"

839
02:02:48,395 --> 02:02:52,297
"But there's something missing..."
"your presence"

840
02:02:52,566 --> 02:02:55,467
"When you get this we'll"
"be in Paris"

841
02:02:57,904 --> 02:02:59,371
"Couldn't you join us there?"

842
02:02:59,573 --> 02:03:04,033
"Do come, if not to Paris,"
"then at least to Switzerland"

843
02:06:02,088 --> 02:06:04,784
Give me some money.
l'm going to the hairdresser

844
02:06:10,697 --> 02:06:11,322
What's that?

845
02:06:14,734 --> 02:06:18,170
"Oh, for a bird's nest"
on top of your head?

846
02:06:19,472 --> 02:06:22,498
Costs 80 francs
Eighty?

847
02:06:24,044 --> 02:06:27,241
Hindustani wives look fine
in plaits

848
02:06:27,447 --> 02:06:31,747
And you can use flowers from
the flower-pot in the anteroom

849
02:06:32,052 --> 02:06:34,987
No. l want a bouffon.
- Let me make it for you

850
02:06:35,221 --> 02:06:37,485
l'll make you a nest
for all of Paris to see

851
02:06:37,624 --> 02:06:39,182
"Say what, l could put in"
a few sparrows too

852
02:06:39,392 --> 02:06:42,486
"For 80 francs, l'd willingly"
become your hairdresser

853
02:06:47,133 --> 02:06:47,997
That l won't have

854
02:08:00,707 --> 02:08:03,175
All this window shopping
is going to kill us

855
02:08:03,376 --> 02:08:05,173
Staying alive is as important
as shopping

856
02:09:48,414 --> 02:09:50,143
Sit down and listen

857
02:09:50,984 --> 02:09:53,043
Did you see the price tag
on that bag?

858
02:09:55,755 --> 02:09:57,188
780 francs

859
02:09:57,857 --> 02:10:01,623
What about the silly bagpipe?
575 francs

860
02:10:01,795 --> 02:10:03,626
So we'll skip the dinner

861
02:10:03,863 --> 02:10:08,459
Great. We've already skipped lunch.
How will we survive?

862
02:10:08,668 --> 02:10:11,228
On the wind in the bagpipe?

863
02:10:11,437 --> 02:10:16,101
You must understand. We're tourists.
We can't spend too much

864
02:10:16,342 --> 02:10:19,573
Let's buy one thing
- The purse

865
02:10:19,813 --> 02:10:24,147
"No, the bagpipe. lt's as"
beautiful as a woman

866
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:26,750
They both have music

867
02:10:28,188 --> 02:10:30,053
Such poetry! Let's forget both

868
02:10:31,024 --> 02:10:37,224
"You're cross. Well, men have"
always been martyrs

869
02:10:37,497 --> 02:10:39,931
l'll be a martyr too

870
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:42,801
"Go on, buy your purse"

871
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:48,394
They must be bombs in real life

872
02:11:48,568 --> 02:11:51,696
Let's hurry or the show will
start by the time we get there

873
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:59,878
Get this clear.
Only l am going to the show

874
02:12:02,448 --> 02:12:06,077
"Oh, no. We are"
"No, only l"

875
02:12:08,788 --> 02:12:12,747
So you want to see this alone
lt's no place for decent women

876
02:12:15,328 --> 02:12:17,592
But it is for decent men?

877
02:12:17,997 --> 02:12:22,593
lt's different for men
- Sure! No matter what happens...

878
02:12:22,969 --> 02:12:26,962
men will always be men.
Narrow minded and outdated

879
02:12:28,474 --> 02:12:29,668
Outdated

880
02:12:30,009 --> 02:12:33,536
"And remember, where l don't go,"
you don't

881
02:12:35,315 --> 02:12:35,940
lf l do?

882
02:12:37,483 --> 02:12:40,281
l've seen the likes of you

883
02:13:02,508 --> 02:13:07,138
Marriage... Huh!
Wives think marriage is a prison

884
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:09,648
And they the jailors

885
02:13:11,517 --> 02:13:16,011
"But remember, Madame jailor,"
prisoners can escape

886
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:39,974
"Here, tahe your bag"

887
02:13:51,224 --> 02:13:51,690
What's going on?

888
02:13:53,226 --> 02:13:56,787
The show has begun.
You can take the front seat

889
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:28,427
l feel ashamed just watching this

890
02:14:30,163 --> 02:14:31,994
But you don't mind
watching them?

891
02:14:33,299 --> 02:14:38,566
They're different.
Their job is to entertain men

892
02:14:39,605 --> 02:14:47,239
Can't a wife entertain
her husband?

893
02:14:48,448 --> 02:14:52,578
She'll lose him otherwise
What a shameless thing to say!

894
02:14:52,819 --> 02:14:56,311
Shame on you and your
outdated ideas

895
02:14:56,689 --> 02:14:58,657
Who says my ideas are outdated?

896
02:14:59,225 --> 02:15:05,460
"l do, your wife. You and"
your ideas are old

897
02:15:06,699 --> 02:15:09,930
l'm old?
- Yes! Old

898
02:15:11,070 --> 02:15:14,699
"God help me, l've got myself"
"an old man"

899
02:15:52,245 --> 02:15:56,147
"He goes to the garden"
"with everyone else"

900
02:16:00,286 --> 02:16:04,017
"But they bring flowers,"
"and he gets me a cabbage"

901
02:16:08,661 --> 02:16:11,858
"Oh what do l do"
"with my old man?"

902
02:16:46,933 --> 02:16:51,131
"l'm young and pretty and"
"graceful as a bird"

903
02:16:55,341 --> 02:17:00,973
"He's old and greying"
"and reaching dotage"

904
02:17:05,518 --> 02:17:09,045
"What is to become"
"of me and my old man?"

905
02:17:41,787 --> 02:17:45,655
"He brings me here"
"to the land of fairies"

906
02:17:50,029 --> 02:17:53,487
"But is cross with me"
"when l drop my veil"

907
02:17:57,670 --> 02:18:01,162
"My life is ruined"
"because of my old man"

908
02:18:01,474 --> 02:18:05,069
"God help me, l've"
"got myself an old man"

909
02:19:55,921 --> 02:19:56,819
l'm so cold

910
02:20:25,017 --> 02:20:25,608
l'm freezing

911
02:20:27,553 --> 02:20:28,918
Drink this. You'll turn into fire

912
02:20:56,315 --> 02:20:56,974
Look

913
02:21:02,655 --> 02:21:03,417
Shall we go out there?

914
02:23:21,327 --> 02:23:22,294
What do we do now?

915
02:24:18,717 --> 02:24:19,376
What happened?

916
02:24:21,186 --> 02:24:23,814
"When the bells rang,"
my pulse seemed to stop

917
02:24:27,292 --> 02:24:32,093
Your pulse should racing today

918
02:24:32,798 --> 02:24:33,423
Why?

919
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:35,867
lt's your birthday

920
02:24:40,005 --> 02:24:40,494
Happy Birthday

921
02:24:42,441 --> 02:24:44,705
What do l give you today?

922
02:24:45,944 --> 02:24:51,246
You've given me all your love

923
02:24:52,217 --> 02:24:57,883
But l'll give you something more
...something incomparable

924
02:25:01,927 --> 02:25:05,055
You'll agree when you see

925
02:25:21,346 --> 02:25:23,746
Get dressed quickly.
l'll answer the phone

926
02:25:25,250 --> 02:25:27,548
What kind of a joke
"is this, Sunder?"

927
02:25:27,853 --> 02:25:28,444
"But, why?"

928
02:25:29,988 --> 02:25:33,151
"Oh, all right."
Near the waterfall?

929
02:26:50,836 --> 02:26:52,303
Close your eyes

930
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:04,438
This is my gift!
What have you to say?

931
02:28:07,412 --> 02:28:09,710
have l kep you waiting?
- No

932
02:28:14,453 --> 02:28:18,082
"Well, how is my present?"

933
02:28:19,291 --> 02:28:22,749
"Gopal, you've brought a warmth"
to these icy mountains

934
02:28:25,163 --> 02:28:25,993
Many happy returns

935
02:28:26,431 --> 02:28:31,232
Thank him. He has come all the way
from Bombay for you

936
02:28:33,906 --> 02:28:37,672
l'm sorry l've come here empty-handed

937
02:28:39,611 --> 02:28:45,481
But you have a teeming
"heart, don't you?"

938
02:28:45,684 --> 02:28:48,084
"My friend, we believe in"
trading in hearts

939
02:28:48,353 --> 02:28:51,254
Keep yourselves company
while l organise lunch.

940
02:28:51,456 --> 02:28:52,252
See me at the restaurant

941
02:28:59,064 --> 02:28:59,860
How are you?

942
02:29:03,902 --> 02:29:07,702
How do l seem?
Don't l look happy?

943
02:29:09,641 --> 02:29:11,438
Or can't you bear
to see me happy?

944
02:29:11,643 --> 02:29:12,109
What are you saying?

945
02:29:17,416 --> 02:29:19,043
Why have you come?

946
02:29:20,285 --> 02:29:23,914
Ask Sunder that

947
02:29:24,089 --> 02:29:27,889
"He phoned me, sent me"
letters and telegrams...

948
02:29:28,126 --> 02:29:29,286
urging me to come

949
02:29:30,128 --> 02:29:35,964
He pleaded with me.
l couldn't refuse him

950
02:29:37,836 --> 02:29:40,464
That's just it.
You never can refuse

951
02:29:41,006 --> 02:29:46,672
One look from you could give awa
the truth and end this story

952
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:52,842
"Those who make sacrifices, don't"
come back to destroy others

953
02:29:57,522 --> 02:30:02,892
"Whatever you may think,"
l've come only for Sunder's sake

954
02:30:03,595 --> 02:30:09,158
"Then leave for my sake, and don't"
come into my life ever again

955
02:30:13,372 --> 02:30:17,775
A married woman's life is
a rainbow in a storm...

956
02:30:18,043 --> 02:30:22,377
and can end like a
line drawn on water...

957
02:30:22,547 --> 02:30:26,506
"which is and, yet isn't"

958
02:30:47,506 --> 02:30:55,743
No there. Sit here. lt's been ages
since l saw you two together

959
02:30:58,417 --> 02:31:00,977
"Go on, strike up a conversation"

960
02:31:01,686 --> 02:31:06,453
"Radha, how are you?"
- Fine. How are you?

961
02:31:07,025 --> 02:31:08,083
"Fine, thank you"

962
02:31:08,827 --> 02:31:11,990
The end of the conversation?

963
02:31:12,197 --> 02:31:15,564
ls there nothing more on earth
to talk about?

964
02:31:16,601 --> 02:31:18,569
Are you corresponding
with your mother?

965
02:31:18,804 --> 02:31:19,395
Yes

966
02:31:19,704 --> 02:31:24,073
ls my mother back from Hardwar?
"- She will, surely!"

967
02:31:24,209 --> 02:31:26,507
Enough! Now it's my turn

968
02:31:26,778 --> 02:31:29,679
"Tell me, where have you been"
in Europe? What have you seen?

969
02:31:31,383 --> 02:31:32,008
Nowhere

970
02:31:34,686 --> 02:31:39,521
Then l'll take you around.
We're going to travel together

971
02:31:44,563 --> 02:31:45,427
"Well, Radha?"

972
02:31:47,532 --> 02:31:51,832
Only two things l treasure in life.

973
02:31:52,237 --> 02:31:55,866
You and him

974
02:31:56,074 --> 02:31:59,805
"Without either of you,"
life would be miserable

975
02:32:00,245 --> 02:32:02,372
"Good you're here, Gopal"

976
02:32:02,647 --> 02:32:03,511
Made my day

977
02:32:05,584 --> 02:32:07,245
Let me order for something to eat

978
02:32:24,236 --> 02:32:25,635
Here sits Gopal

979
02:32:27,405 --> 02:32:29,202
"Beside Gopal, Radha"

980
02:32:29,274 --> 02:32:29,899
And l...

981
02:32:31,076 --> 02:32:34,273
there
ln front of Gopal and Radha

982
02:33:05,577 --> 02:33:11,345
You're lost again. Come in
and see the arrangements

983
02:33:11,783 --> 02:33:14,980
The three of us are together again
after ages. Celebrating your birthday

984
02:33:15,187 --> 02:33:16,586
"That, too, here in Europe."
Now here's the programme

985
02:33:16,788 --> 02:33:19,120
"First, we go to the casino"

986
02:33:19,324 --> 02:33:22,851
"Now that he's here, he must"
see the casino

987
02:33:23,628 --> 02:33:28,531
Then we eat dinner here

988
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:31,960
How does it sound?
- Lovely

989
02:33:32,337 --> 02:33:34,669
Will Gopal like it?
- Why not?

990
02:33:35,073 --> 02:33:39,601
He hasn't come yet.
Let me call him up

991
02:34:02,734 --> 02:34:03,701
"Strange, she says he has left"

992
02:34:50,882 --> 02:34:53,442
"l'm a married woman, Gopal"

993
02:34:53,685 --> 02:34:58,145
"Those who make sacrifices, don't"
"come back to destroy others"

994
02:36:13,765 --> 02:36:15,699
l couldn't bring much for you.
Just a few things...

995
02:36:16,067 --> 02:36:19,298
All this wasn't necessary.
"Tell me, how was Europe?"

996
02:36:19,471 --> 02:36:22,702
Great! l didn't even realise
how fast time flies

997
02:36:22,907 --> 02:36:26,866
"You are happy, aren't you?"
Yes

998
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:30,275
"l'm very happy, Sakina."

999
02:36:31,750 --> 02:36:38,679
"But once, Gopal dropped by."
- Gopal? ln Europe?

1000
02:36:41,259 --> 02:36:44,228
Sunder had called him over
for my birthday

1001
02:36:45,864 --> 02:36:50,130
So what? Whatever happened between
you and Gopal is a matter of the past

1002
02:36:50,702 --> 02:36:55,571
"No Sakina, l'm afraid."
- Of what?

1003
02:36:55,940 --> 02:37:01,776
Sunder can't live without Gopal
just as he can't live without me

1004
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:24,369
"He would breathe a sigh,"
and he would tell me...

1005
02:41:24,809 --> 02:41:26,606
"Sunder, you've very lucky..."

1006
02:41:27,679 --> 02:41:31,376
"to have a friend like Gopal"
"and a sweetheart like Radha"

1007
02:41:33,084 --> 02:41:36,451
Then he'd start humming.
The same song every time

1008
02:41:37,422 --> 02:41:39,117
Heart rending

1009
02:41:41,159 --> 02:41:41,921
What song?

1010
02:41:43,461 --> 02:41:48,899
lt still gives me gooseflesh.
Want to hear it?

1011
02:41:49,834 --> 02:41:50,858
l'll sing it

1012
02:42:19,197 --> 02:42:25,227
"My friend was no friend"

1013
02:42:26,003 --> 02:42:30,872
"My beloved was not true"

1014
02:42:32,076 --> 02:42:42,384
"l have no faith left in life"

1015
02:43:30,067 --> 02:43:33,833
"The one l gave my love"

1016
02:43:34,172 --> 02:43:37,938
"Was it not you, my friend?"

1017
02:43:38,276 --> 02:43:40,039
"You were the one"

1018
02:43:42,747 --> 02:43:54,488
"The one who walked with me"
"You were the one"

1019
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:06,860
"There are no more secrets"

1020
02:44:07,171 --> 02:44:15,078
"l have no faith left in life"

1021
02:44:38,202 --> 02:44:45,938
"The soft embraces"
"The throaty whispers"

1022
02:44:46,210 --> 02:44:52,115
"Were you not the one?"
"You were the one"

1023
02:44:54,619 --> 02:45:02,219
"Tears in her eyes when we parted"
"Were my pearls"

1024
02:45:02,593 --> 02:45:08,395
"Were you not the one?"

1025
02:45:11,102 --> 02:45:18,338
"That night of passions is spent"

1026
02:45:19,377 --> 02:45:26,647
"l have no faith left in life"

1027
02:46:09,093 --> 02:46:11,527
"Sunder, what's wrong?"

1028
02:46:14,899 --> 02:46:15,957
Nothing

1029
02:46:21,672 --> 02:46:24,937
l remembered the singer.
How he must have loved her

1030
02:46:25,176 --> 02:46:26,200
Whom?

1031
02:46:27,445 --> 02:46:30,414
She left him and
she married his friend

1032
02:46:33,718 --> 02:46:35,413
l'm not surprised about
"the girl, Radha"

1033
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:38,247
"But about the friend, Gopal"

1034
02:46:38,622 --> 02:46:42,820
How could he have declared
love to his friend's fiancee?

1035
02:46:43,694 --> 02:46:53,001
He should have killed himself!
Like the poet did...

1036
02:46:54,338 --> 02:46:57,307
with the girl's name on
his lips

1037
02:47:04,015 --> 02:47:10,045
The poet expressed
his pain in song

1038
02:47:11,155 --> 02:47:20,723
But there are some who
suffer in silence

1039
02:47:21,065 --> 02:47:22,054
They can say nothing

1040
02:47:23,768 --> 02:47:24,462
Bye

1041
02:47:39,717 --> 02:47:43,847
"l asked you once before,"
and l ask you again

1042
02:47:44,989 --> 02:47:49,756
Don't come to my house.
Not even if Sunder insists

1043
02:47:52,396 --> 02:47:53,488
l beg of you

1044
02:48:19,423 --> 02:48:25,259
"Don't come to my house. Not even"
"if Sunder insists. l beg of you"

1045
02:48:45,249 --> 02:48:49,652
Mrs Mehra has called several times.
She wants you at the party by eight

1046
02:48:49,987 --> 02:48:53,047
l've laid out your clothes.
- l'm not going to the party

1047
02:48:55,326 --> 02:48:56,486
Listen...
- Yes?

1048
02:48:56,861 --> 02:49:01,059
l'm not at home for any caller.
Also Sunder

1049
02:49:07,004 --> 02:49:10,030
Always late. You'll never change

1050
02:49:11,342 --> 02:49:14,368
Have you thought of those
who wait for you?

1051
02:49:19,884 --> 02:49:24,048
What happened? You didn't
even notice my saree

1052
02:49:24,355 --> 02:49:26,255
Nice.
- You didn't even see it

1053
02:49:28,492 --> 02:49:30,983
l've seen it now.
lt's very nice

1054
02:49:32,163 --> 02:49:34,996
Don't sit now. We're late already

1055
02:49:35,299 --> 02:49:37,563
A while longer won't matter
- lt will

1056
02:49:37,868 --> 02:49:41,770
Wing Commander Mehra is
throwing this party for us

1057
02:49:42,373 --> 02:49:44,068
Get ready. Fast

1058
02:49:46,911 --> 02:49:49,175
Lots of people are coming

1059
02:49:49,713 --> 02:49:51,738
l'm in no mood for partying

1060
02:49:56,320 --> 02:49:58,083
You're sitting again?

1061
02:50:01,659 --> 02:50:02,921
What's come over you today?

1062
02:50:03,394 --> 02:50:08,297
Don't even ask. This has never
happened before

1063
02:50:08,666 --> 02:50:15,868
Gopal saw me. And he ignored me.
l called out for him.

1064
02:50:16,207 --> 02:50:19,108
And he pretended not to hear

1065
02:50:19,476 --> 02:50:22,912
"l went to his house, and he was at"
home then. They said he wasn't in

1066
02:50:25,950 --> 02:50:27,315
l was stunned

1067
02:50:34,692 --> 02:50:35,716
He's my friend

1068
02:50:35,960 --> 02:50:38,258
You are his friend

1069
02:50:38,629 --> 02:50:42,463
l will have nothing
to do with him anymore

1070
02:50:43,100 --> 02:50:50,006
There are other places we can go to.
There are others we can meet

1071
02:50:50,241 --> 02:50:55,736
"Get up and go change, While you're"
"about it, change your mood, too"

1072
02:51:13,964 --> 02:51:16,091
Why is my eye twitching?

1073
02:51:25,175 --> 02:51:26,233
Listen...

1074
02:51:29,480 --> 02:51:30,640
How does the necklace look?

1075
02:51:35,152 --> 02:51:40,590
"Nice, but isn't this a mismatch?"
- Why?

1076
02:51:41,425 --> 02:51:45,020
You look as gorgeous as a queen.
Not the soldier's wife you are

1077
02:51:46,830 --> 02:51:50,527
What do l wear then?
- How about that set...

1078
02:51:52,002 --> 02:51:54,527
Here's the key.
Choose what you want

1079
02:51:54,905 --> 02:51:57,635
Don't be cross.
- Why not? You never like my choice

1080
02:51:58,008 --> 02:52:02,274
No! lt's beautiful! First class!
"- Go on, get it"

1081
02:52:54,064 --> 02:52:57,090
"When you read my letter"

1082
02:52:58,902 --> 02:53:00,733
"Don't be angry"

1083
02:53:02,573 --> 02:53:05,565
"For, you are my life"

1084
02:53:06,710 --> 02:53:09,372
"You are my very own"

1085
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:27,820
"You're pure as the Ganga"
"As pristine as the Yamuna"

1086
02:53:29,533 --> 02:53:35,665
"You're so close to me,"
"that you're my very being"

1087
02:53:55,359 --> 02:53:57,987
Don't read this

1088
02:54:03,434 --> 02:54:04,332
Who wrote it?

1089
02:54:06,970 --> 02:54:08,301
Who wrote that letter?

1090
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:15,545
No one... l don't know who!
l haven't even read it properly

1091
02:54:17,915 --> 02:54:22,284
l'll take it. You get ready.
They've already called once

1092
02:54:27,991 --> 02:54:31,722
"Mrs Mehra? Yes, it's me"

1093
02:54:36,800 --> 02:54:39,701
He came home late
"Yes, we're just coming"

1094
02:54:40,671 --> 02:54:41,865
We'll be there in 15 minutes

1095
02:54:42,673 --> 02:54:45,836
"Yes, we're coming"

1096
02:55:12,369 --> 02:55:15,668
"l told her, we'd be there"
in 15 minutes

1097
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:18,708
But we must start now

1098
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:24,279
Mrs Mehra's parties are
like a parade

1099
02:55:24,815 --> 02:55:30,253
"You're standing... Do sit. Oh no,"
"why are you sitting? stand up"

1100
02:55:30,654 --> 02:55:39,323
And she loves to feed people.
You should make her run the mess

1101
02:55:49,072 --> 02:55:56,205
"Still not ready? Just think,"
everyone will be waiting for us

1102
02:56:11,295 --> 02:56:13,923
You look so handsome

1103
02:56:18,969 --> 02:56:20,027
Shall we?

1104
02:56:39,323 --> 02:56:41,348
l've forgotten
my handkerchief

1105
02:57:20,364 --> 02:57:21,729
Why the excuse?

1106
02:57:26,036 --> 02:57:31,633
l was wondering why you
had to tear the letter

1107
02:57:32,309 --> 02:57:36,871
What else was l supposed to do?
Preserve it all my life?

1108
02:57:40,183 --> 02:57:41,741
You have preserved it. Till now

1109
02:57:43,387 --> 02:57:44,547
To show it to you

1110
02:57:49,926 --> 02:57:50,756
To show me?

1111
02:57:54,197 --> 02:57:57,166
Why did you tear it up then?
Why did you tear it?

1112
02:57:58,335 --> 02:57:59,131
l was scared

1113
02:58:00,203 --> 02:58:01,670
Of whom?
- You!

1114
02:58:04,408 --> 02:58:05,033
Why?

1115
02:58:06,343 --> 02:58:08,607
ln case you misunderstood

1116
02:58:08,945 --> 02:58:10,276
Who wrote it?
- l don't know

1117
02:58:11,548 --> 02:58:14,779
"Tell me the truth, who wrote it?"
- l tell you l don't know

1118
02:58:19,823 --> 02:58:22,257
l got it before we were married.
You were at war

1119
02:58:22,559 --> 02:58:24,857
So what if l weren't here?
Why didn't you show it to him?

1120
02:58:25,228 --> 02:58:26,820
To whom?
- Gopal

1121
02:58:31,968 --> 02:58:32,900
That which l am going to do now!

1122
02:58:45,650 --> 02:58:46,617
"No, Sunder!"

1123
02:58:56,661 --> 02:59:02,099
"Till l know who wrote this letter,"
l will be walking on hot coals

1124
02:59:04,068 --> 02:59:09,301
"When l get to know, l will"
put a bullet through his heart

1125
02:59:24,722 --> 02:59:30,058
This toast is not for Sqn Ldr Sunder.
"His squadron, his wings..."

1126
02:59:30,428 --> 02:59:36,389
the lndian Air Force and the entire
nation are proud of his bravery

1127
02:59:36,968 --> 02:59:41,405
This toast is for the one
whose name wasn't in the papers

1128
02:59:42,173 --> 02:59:43,538
The one who wasn't awarded
the gallantry medal

1129
02:59:43,841 --> 02:59:49,074
"And she is Sunder's girlfriend,"
and now his wife. Radha

1130
02:59:54,318 --> 02:59:58,152
Everyone had accepted
that Sunder was alive

1131
02:59:58,990 --> 03:00:02,517
Radha was the only one
who refused to accept it

1132
03:00:08,132 --> 03:00:15,732
Your love and your loyalty snatched
Sunder back from the jaws of death

1133
03:00:16,474 --> 03:00:17,839
We're proud of women like you

1134
03:00:33,224 --> 03:00:34,350
Don't drink anymore

1135
03:00:36,160 --> 03:00:43,123
Why don't you drink too? This is
"to you, your love and loyalty"

1136
03:00:48,906 --> 03:00:50,339
What are you doing?

1137
03:00:51,575 --> 03:00:53,338
Today is our anniversary too

1138
03:00:54,445 --> 03:00:56,538
Today was the day we got married

1139
03:00:58,916 --> 03:01:00,406
Joined in matrimony

1140
03:01:02,053 --> 03:01:05,887
"Now after a year, for the first time,"
we understand each other

1141
03:01:06,924 --> 03:01:10,291
We know each other now. Don't we?

1142
03:01:12,263 --> 03:01:14,891
Let's drink to the new understanding

1143
03:01:35,353 --> 03:01:36,581
Radha will sing for us

1144
03:01:37,555 --> 03:01:40,581
l can't sing

1145
03:01:41,192 --> 03:01:42,784
Have you forgotten how to sing?

1146
03:01:43,094 --> 03:01:44,652
"But, l..."

1147
03:01:45,296 --> 03:01:46,456
"Come on Radha, sing for us"

1148
03:01:51,168 --> 03:01:53,932
Please help me out of this

1149
03:01:54,372 --> 03:01:56,169
How can l sing now?

1150
03:01:57,808 --> 03:01:58,604
Why not?

1151
03:02:02,780 --> 03:02:05,442
"She'll not only sing,"
but she'll dance for us

1152
03:02:11,789 --> 03:02:18,217
This is the right time
and the right place

1153
03:02:18,529 --> 03:02:21,498
"lf not today, when"
are you going to sing?

1154
03:02:34,478 --> 03:02:38,039
"Right. When, if not now?"

1155
03:02:38,416 --> 03:02:43,251
l'll do whatever you ask me today.
For your sake

1156
03:03:16,654 --> 03:03:21,216
"Oh my love, my beloved"

1157
03:03:21,525 --> 03:03:26,019
"We're two bodies but one being"

1158
03:03:26,730 --> 03:03:30,689
"Like two wishes in one heart"

1159
03:04:10,508 --> 03:04:19,473
"This is the holy union of"
the Ganga and the Yamuna

1160
03:04:19,850 --> 03:04:24,082
"The truth lies before us"

1161
03:04:24,455 --> 03:04:28,824
"The past was just a dream"

1162
03:04:33,764 --> 03:04:38,098
"We mortals have made"
"this earth our home"

1163
03:04:38,469 --> 03:04:42,599
"lf nothing else we are human"

1164
03:06:48,866 --> 03:06:51,232
Once l know who wrote that...

1165
03:06:52,202 --> 03:06:53,635
Once l know who wrote that letter...

1166
03:07:07,751 --> 03:07:09,651
lf l could tell you just once
who wrote it...

1167
03:07:38,916 --> 03:07:45,549
l knew the letter would create trouble
someday. But you wouldn't listen

1168
03:07:46,657 --> 03:07:51,356
He keeps asking
who wrote the letter

1169
03:07:51,729 --> 03:07:56,757
l don't know what to say
- You should've said Gopal wrote it

1170
03:07:57,134 --> 03:08:02,697
lt wasn't so easy. He was holding
a revolver. lt was loaded

1171
03:08:03,006 --> 03:08:07,067
He wanted to kill. Not me.
But the one who wrote it

1172
03:08:10,013 --> 03:08:11,810
Let him empty his revolver today

1173
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:18,246
l'm going to Sunder. To tell him
it was l who wrote the letter

1174
03:08:18,622 --> 03:08:20,112
But Radha is yours. Only yours

1175
03:08:59,797 --> 03:09:00,764
You... here?

1176
03:09:02,266 --> 03:09:04,200
l have something to say

1177
03:09:08,472 --> 03:09:09,439
Go ahead

1178
03:09:13,076 --> 03:09:14,373
Do you love me?

1179
03:09:19,149 --> 03:09:21,982
Need l say how much?

1180
03:09:25,422 --> 03:09:26,650
How much?

1181
03:09:29,259 --> 03:09:31,227
So much that if you were
to ask me for my life...

1182
03:09:31,595 --> 03:09:34,655
l'd tell you it's
a trivial thing to ask

1183
03:09:35,098 --> 03:09:41,298
"lf you were to kill me, l'd write"
a suicide note before l died

1184
03:09:41,705 --> 03:09:43,036
Will you hear more?

1185
03:09:46,910 --> 03:09:52,075
l will never be able to
repay your debt

1186
03:09:55,185 --> 03:09:58,746
Anyone else in your place
would've married Radha

1187
03:09:59,189 --> 03:10:03,091
Stop this nonsense.
- Let me say it

1188
03:10:04,928 --> 03:10:08,955
No friend can do as much
as you have done

1189
03:10:10,868 --> 03:10:13,302
Radha's parents liked you

1190
03:10:13,670 --> 03:10:15,900
"For a while, l was taken for dead"

1191
03:10:18,308 --> 03:10:19,935
But you stood true to your promise

1192
03:10:22,679 --> 03:10:27,776
You promised me... you wouldn't let
anyone stand between me and Radha

1193
03:10:31,755 --> 03:10:34,849
"lf you hadn't kept your promise,"
it would've killed me

1194
03:10:51,341 --> 03:10:58,076
Remember? l used to say that you need
a friend's shoulder to weep upon

1195
03:10:58,382 --> 03:11:00,475
And you need a friend
to be your pallbearer

1196
03:11:10,394 --> 03:11:12,555
Now you know how much l love you

1197
03:11:15,499 --> 03:11:18,161
"Anyway, forget all this"

1198
03:11:19,803 --> 03:11:22,829
What did you want to tell me?

1199
03:11:29,279 --> 03:11:31,839
Nothing

1200
03:11:45,429 --> 03:11:47,659
l couldn't even tell Gopal

1201
03:12:26,670 --> 03:12:27,659
Come here

1202
03:12:36,813 --> 03:12:42,809
"Tell me, just once, tell me,"
"l am your life, your everything"

1203
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:44,109
Say it

1204
03:12:46,490 --> 03:12:50,324
You are my everything!
You are my life

1205
03:12:52,629 --> 03:13:00,536
"The soft embraces"
"The throaty whispers"

1206
03:13:05,442 --> 03:13:07,342
"Were you not the one?"
"You were the one"

1207
03:13:09,846 --> 03:13:17,810
"Tears in her eyes when we parted"
"Were my pearls"

1208
03:13:18,188 --> 03:13:22,215
"Were you not the one?"

1209
03:13:27,464 --> 03:13:31,093
"That night of passions is spent"

1210
03:13:31,468 --> 03:13:35,268
"l have no faith left in life"

1211
03:13:35,672 --> 03:13:43,977
"The heady night is past."
"Dreams are no more"

1212
03:13:44,681 --> 03:13:48,378
Why do you blame life? Why don't
you say that you don't trust me?

1213
03:13:54,758 --> 03:13:57,454
Say there's no place for me
in your life

1214
03:13:57,828 --> 03:14:01,787
"That's what you mean, don't you?"
"Go on, say it"

1215
03:14:02,165 --> 03:14:04,827
There's no place for
me in this house

1216
03:14:05,202 --> 03:14:10,538
Kill me if you want to!
Throw me out if you wish

1217
03:14:10,907 --> 03:14:14,274
"But for God's sake,"
don't sing that song

1218
03:14:19,783 --> 03:14:25,688
l can't bear those poisoned barbs

1219
03:14:40,270 --> 03:14:41,703
You don't like the song?

1220
03:14:47,144 --> 03:14:48,543
Then l won't sing it

1221
03:16:23,573 --> 03:16:24,801
l'm leaving

1222
03:16:26,676 --> 03:16:27,404
Where to?

1223
03:16:29,179 --> 03:16:30,077
l don't know

1224
03:16:36,386 --> 03:16:40,220
Leaving your home?
Are you leaving me?

1225
03:16:46,463 --> 03:16:47,088
"Don't leave, Radha"

1226
03:16:54,204 --> 03:16:55,831
"Don't leave your home, Radha"

1227
03:17:05,282 --> 03:17:11,915
"You know that my happiness, my life,"
"my love, everything is in this house"

1228
03:17:12,222 --> 03:17:14,850
lt's all about your love

1229
03:17:15,225 --> 03:17:21,164
"Without you, l cannot live"
"But now, l can't live with you"

1230
03:17:21,698 --> 03:17:24,861
l can't bear your pain

1231
03:17:26,303 --> 03:17:36,201
l married you to make you happy.
"Not to give you pain. But, if you..."

1232
03:17:36,780 --> 03:17:42,480
"You haven't given me pain, Radha."
l've brought this upon myself

1233
03:17:43,253 --> 03:17:44,220
But why?

1234
03:17:46,389 --> 03:17:47,617
Do l need to say?

1235
03:17:49,859 --> 03:17:51,884
Then what can l do
to end your suffering?

1236
03:17:52,262 --> 03:17:55,561
How do l make you believe me?

1237
03:17:56,066 --> 03:18:01,663
"l swear, ever since we got married"
l've thought of no-one else

1238
03:18:02,672 --> 03:18:08,702
Look at me... look into my eyes

1239
03:18:08,945 --> 03:18:11,311
What do you see?

1240
03:18:15,685 --> 03:18:20,748
"l see only love, Radha."
Love and the truth

1241
03:18:26,296 --> 03:18:35,466
"But when l touch you, l feel as if"
"someone before me, also touched you"

1242
03:18:36,973 --> 03:18:42,343
The thought makes my heart
burn with jealousy

1243
03:18:42,912 --> 03:18:48,214
Doubt lurks in the dark shadows
"of my heart, and tears me to pieces"

1244
03:18:49,185 --> 03:18:53,121
You look like a dark apparition!
And then l begin to doubt you

1245
03:18:53,490 --> 03:18:59,122
"l become desperate, uncontrollable!"
My whole life seems to flounder

1246
03:19:00,196 --> 03:19:01,959
l don't know what to do

1247
03:19:02,265 --> 03:19:04,961
l can't be angry with you
nor can l blame anyone else

1248
03:19:05,268 --> 03:19:10,035
Tell me what to do.
What can l do?

1249
03:19:23,820 --> 03:19:27,984
l feel like picking up this gun
and shooting myself

1250
03:19:49,913 --> 03:19:55,545
"He shot at himself. Somehow,"
"l clung to him, and he missed"

1251
03:19:55,919 --> 03:19:58,786
What should l do?

1252
03:19:59,122 --> 03:20:02,558
l can neither live without him
nor can l live with him

1253
03:20:02,926 --> 03:20:06,760
That letter is like a dagger
in his hands with which...

1254
03:20:07,130 --> 03:20:10,361
he stabs at his own heart
and he stabs at my heart

1255
03:20:10,733 --> 03:20:16,638
"l could bear my own pain,"
but l can't bear his pain

1256
03:20:18,074 --> 03:20:20,975
l wish...

1257
03:20:22,479 --> 03:20:23,707
Have you gone mad?

1258
03:20:35,225 --> 03:20:38,820
l came to ask you to take care
of your friend

1259
03:20:39,429 --> 03:20:44,059
All he has is my love
and your friendship

1260
03:20:45,602 --> 03:20:48,264
The pall of suspicion clouds
my love for him

1261
03:20:48,605 --> 03:20:51,540
Maybe he can still cling on
to your friendship

1262
03:20:51,908 --> 03:20:53,876
Take care of him

1263
03:21:12,795 --> 03:21:15,423
Radha has left!
Radha has gone away somewhere

1264
03:21:17,400 --> 03:21:20,836
Gone away? Why don't you say
she has escaped?

1265
03:21:22,939 --> 03:21:25,499
Yes! She has escaped

1266
03:21:26,876 --> 03:21:29,640
She has escaped from you!
And she has come here

1267
03:21:40,223 --> 03:21:44,319
Radha has escaped the cluthes
of your cruelty

1268
03:21:48,998 --> 03:21:51,398
Cruelty? How would you know
who was cruel to whom?

1269
03:21:53,670 --> 03:21:56,138
What a hell she left me to live in

1270
03:21:57,907 --> 03:22:00,933
You don't know what wounds
l carry in my heart

1271
03:22:01,678 --> 03:22:05,671
Today these wounds
have been rippen open

1272
03:22:06,482 --> 03:22:09,815
l've been betrayed

1273
03:22:10,186 --> 03:22:13,622
She has betrayed me!
Radha! My wife

1274
03:22:13,923 --> 03:22:15,481
That's a lie
Lie?

1275
03:22:15,858 --> 03:22:19,225
ls it a lie?

1276
03:22:19,596 --> 03:22:24,431
"Ask her, who is man"
who shadows our life?

1277
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:33,839
Who is he?
Ask her who he is

1278
03:22:37,046 --> 03:22:41,107
l know who's more precious to Radha
than anybody else on earth

1279
03:22:41,551 --> 03:22:44,349
And l know the shadow
that darkens your lives

1280
03:22:44,554 --> 03:22:45,521
Gopal! No!

1281
03:22:47,890 --> 03:22:48,857
You know?

1282
03:22:50,426 --> 03:22:52,485
And l know who wrote
the letter

1283
03:22:54,497 --> 03:22:55,464
Who wrote it?

1284
03:22:55,965 --> 03:22:57,990
l wrote it

1285
03:22:58,901 --> 03:23:01,267
Now listen to why
l wrote it

1286
03:23:03,239 --> 03:23:05,070
l was in love with Radha

1287
03:23:42,145 --> 03:23:49,210
Lie!
That's a lie!

1288
03:23:51,621 --> 03:23:55,250
Tell me that's a lie

1289
03:24:01,731 --> 03:24:05,997
"At least, lie to me!"
And tell me it's a lie

1290
03:24:08,838 --> 03:24:11,466
A pity is it isn't a lie

1291
03:24:12,642 --> 03:24:15,975
"Till today, l never found the courage"
to tell you the truth

1292
03:24:16,512 --> 03:24:18,980
"And today, you haven't the courage"
to hear the truth

1293
03:24:20,316 --> 03:24:27,722
The truth is that l loved her dearly.
Just the way you loved her

1294
03:24:30,259 --> 03:24:33,490
The only difference was that
"you spoke of it, and l couldn't"

1295
03:24:34,464 --> 03:24:41,028
"For years, l stifled my love."
But l never brought it to my lips

1296
03:24:41,504 --> 03:24:47,704
Only because you loved Radha
And you were a friend

1297
03:24:48,077 --> 03:24:50,443
"For the sake of our friendship,"
l stayed silent

1298
03:24:51,280 --> 03:24:56,081
"As with the news of your death,"
my love for Radha was true too

1299
03:24:56,352 --> 03:24:58,445
We were even to get married

1300
03:24:59,522 --> 03:25:01,387
Then we heard you were alive

1301
03:25:01,958 --> 03:25:02,856
l retreated

1302
03:25:04,026 --> 03:25:06,256
l sacrificed my love
for my friendship

1303
03:25:06,629 --> 03:25:09,029
And Radha became yours. Only yours

1304
03:25:09,966 --> 03:25:14,494
"When she entered your home,"
she was pure as the Ganges

1305
03:25:14,771 --> 03:25:18,263
"And today, when she has left"
"your house, she is still as pure"

1306
03:25:18,641 --> 03:25:21,838
"Now take your gun,"
and pump it into my bosom

1307
03:25:29,519 --> 03:25:34,957
"Well done, Gopal"
"A sacrafice, again?"

1308
03:25:36,259 --> 03:25:40,821
Just like throwing a tip
at a beggar

1309
03:25:41,864 --> 03:25:43,263
l'm not a beggar

1310
03:25:44,534 --> 03:25:46,092
l am your friend

1311
03:25:46,836 --> 03:25:50,772
l was your friend... but
you never understood me

1312
03:25:51,440 --> 03:25:54,341
Or this need never have happened

1313
03:25:54,911 --> 03:25:58,142
lf only you had revealed
your feelings...

1314
03:25:58,414 --> 03:26:01,975
if only you had spoken
your mind...

1315
03:26:02,251 --> 03:26:07,382
three lives would've
been spared this torture

1316
03:26:09,892 --> 03:26:18,732
lf only you had let me do
what you have done...

1317
03:26:22,104 --> 03:26:26,404
lf only you had told me once...

1318
03:26:26,776 --> 03:26:29,336
l would've have stepped
out of your way

1319
03:26:39,355 --> 03:26:44,554
"Well, better late than never"

1320
03:26:46,629 --> 03:26:49,496
lt can still be done

1321
03:26:50,199 --> 03:26:52,099
No! lt cannot be done

1322
03:26:52,468 --> 03:26:54,163
"l ask you, and l ask you"

1323
03:26:54,470 --> 03:26:57,633
"You who loved me, and"
you who married me

1324
03:26:59,475 --> 03:27:03,912
Who gave the two of you the right
to decide about my life again?

1325
03:27:04,280 --> 03:27:05,975
What do you think l am?

1326
03:27:09,485 --> 03:27:11,043
lt is true that l have loved

1327
03:27:11,487 --> 03:27:15,446
Not that l was the first woman
to fall in love

1328
03:27:17,894 --> 03:27:21,227
Love can't be helped.
lt happens

1329
03:27:22,899 --> 03:27:25,629
Marriage is an article of faith.
One nurtures a marriage

1330
03:27:26,002 --> 03:27:28,061
And l have nurtured my faith

1331
03:27:28,905 --> 03:27:31,339
Desire is like a flame.
Love burns

1332
03:27:32,508 --> 03:27:35,238
But faith has to stand rock solid

1333
03:27:35,511 --> 03:27:41,746
l am no wax-doll or some commodity
to be passed on from one to another

1334
03:27:42,051 --> 03:27:42,745
Bravo!

1335
03:27:43,586 --> 03:27:48,922
"One makes me his sacrificial lamb,"
and now the other too?

1336
03:27:51,928 --> 03:27:55,796
There will be no more sacrifices

1337
03:27:56,599 --> 03:27:58,157
"The one who must, leaves"

1338
03:28:00,870 --> 03:28:03,100
"Before you leave, tell me"
where do l go?

1339
03:28:04,273 --> 03:28:05,797
What about my marriage?

1340
03:28:06,142 --> 03:28:09,305
Am l to ask someone else
to marry me again?

1341
03:28:09,812 --> 03:28:13,908
Am l to ask someone else
to make me his bride again?

1342
03:28:15,418 --> 03:28:21,414
"Tell me. Look at me, l'm the bride"
you married and took home

1343
03:28:23,759 --> 03:28:29,163
Remember those marriage vows
you and l took before God?

1344
03:28:32,234 --> 03:28:34,930
Does one swear by the holy fires
only to be punished like this?

1345
03:28:35,571 --> 03:28:37,732
ls a one supposed to suffer
a lifetime for it?

1346
03:28:41,110 --> 03:28:42,077
No Radha

1347
03:28:43,079 --> 03:28:45,673
Reading a few sacred cantos together
does not make a marriage

1348
03:28:47,049 --> 03:28:54,649
Conjugal love is not the union.
That union is the union of hearts

1349
03:28:55,458 --> 03:28:58,222
The mating of souls
that climaxes in a bliss

1350
03:28:59,729 --> 03:29:01,720
Ours was no real union

1351
03:29:03,699 --> 03:29:06,031
The union was between you and...

1352
03:29:21,117 --> 03:29:22,084
What have you done?

1353
03:29:29,125 --> 03:29:31,320
This is nothing

1354
03:29:35,898 --> 03:29:37,991
One of us had to leave

1355
03:29:38,300 --> 03:29:42,066
The one who should have left
is leaving

1356
03:29:59,655 --> 03:30:04,957
"Remember, you used to say that one"
needs a friend's shoulder to weep upon

1357
03:30:06,262 --> 03:30:08,059
And you need a friend
to be one's pallbearer

1358
03:30:11,934 --> 03:30:19,966
"My friend, you only left this city."
l'm leaving the world

1359
03:30:24,680 --> 03:30:28,411
"Before you left, you took"
a promise from me

1360
03:30:30,386 --> 03:30:33,446
Now l ask you for a promise

1361
03:30:45,501 --> 03:30:50,996
"Sunder, give Radha back"
The Heaven that was hers

1362
03:30:54,543 --> 03:30:58,809
That the Rivers Ganga and Yamuna
may unite and flow...

1363
03:31:02,384 --> 03:31:07,947
the River Saraswati must
be sacrificed
