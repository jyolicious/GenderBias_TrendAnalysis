1
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,886
Anwar Hussain is bound to win
tonight's poetry competition.

2
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,219
I'm willing to bet anything
from Rs.1 to RsJOO.

3
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,223
You're on for a bet.
You're my witnesses.

4
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:02,660
Lala Rastogi will win the
gold medal this year.

5
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:07,035
Are you embarrassed to
call me Ghayal ?

6
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:09,572
I'm a poet, you know.
No ordinary one.

7
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,942
If I don't win,
GhayaPs not my name.

8
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:18,010
But I won't win.
Because Anwar's my friend.

9
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:21,150
Did that penetrate your brain ?
- You penetrated our group.

10
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,186
I'm sorry. I'm off now.

11
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,265
All the girls are talking
about you.

12
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:48,239
Everyone says that you will win the
Urdu poetry competition his year.

13
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:53,313
Pal, if you want to win
recite your poem to me.

14
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:57,684
And get Binda Din GhayaPs
expert opinion.

15
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,317
Ghayal, tonight's poetry
competition ?

16
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,553
I don't have a single poem
to recite.

17
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,261
Not a single poem ?
Why ever not ?

18
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,671
My heart and my brain just
haven't been obeying me.

19
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,400
I was awake all night.

20
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:20,172
I see. As usual you must have
eaten too much.

21
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,313
And now you must have a
stomach ache.

22
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,884
You idiot. Not a stomach ache.
A heart ache.

23
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:30,088
You knowl haven't found
the girl in purdah yet.

24
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,354
The college will close for
the holidays today.

25
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,056
Everyone will go home.
So will she.

26
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:40,962
My friend. Think of something
so I can find her.

27
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,569
Listen.
Everyone knows...

28
00:04:44,693 --> 00:04:47,833
You'll will be reciting a
poem at the contest tonight.

29
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,944
If she loves you

30
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,673
She's bound to come to
see you tonight.

31
00:04:55,771 --> 00:05:03,212
Recite a poem. In which you
address your beloved

32
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,416
And reveal your heart to her.

33
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:10,998
Tell her you weep for her.
You're dying for her.

34
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:13,690
Present yourself at the
poetry contest.

35
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,665
The contest will end.
You wish will be fulfilled.

36
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,793
But where's the time to
compose a poem ?

37
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:20,134
There are 2 hours yet.

38
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:25,109
Where there's a will
there's a way.

39
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:31,509
Get your act together.

40
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,016
This is my first poem!

41
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:37,717
We now present the young poet
from Aligarh.

42
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:56,032
"My beloved"

43
00:05:56,498 --> 00:06:04,974
"I swear upon my love"

44
00:06:14,817 --> 00:06:24,431
"Let your beautiful eyes
assure me of your love"

45
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:32,603
"Return my lost joy to me"

46
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:57,665
"You are the vision
of my dreams"

47
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:16,751
"Your image haunts me
away and night"

48
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:26,323
"My every heartbeat
calls out to you"

49
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:35,767
"Assure me your tomorrows
will be mine"

50
00:08:01,457 --> 00:08:09,342
I cannot forget
your beauty"

51
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:18,846
"We met in a chance encounter"

52
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:28,956
"Athousand poems lay
scattered at our feet"

53
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:38,127
I dedicated them
all to your voice.

54
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:21,642
"How can I forget that
first time?"

55
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:31,614
Your eyes intoxicated me.

56
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:41,761
"Lightning thrilled
my very being"

57
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:51,240
"When I touched your
velvet hands"

58
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:00,520
"Assure me those hands
will be mine"

59
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:34,114
"I caught but a glimpse of
you once"

60
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:44,122
"I long to meet you again"

61
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:54,234
"Your shadow is a beautiful
Taj Mahal to me"

62
00:10:54,763 --> 00:11:02,614
"Let me woo you on a
starlit night"

63
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:12,816
"Let your fragrant curls
assure me of your love"

64
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:45,815
"I seek you everywhere"

65
00:11:47,282 --> 00:11:55,827
"My hopes near exhaustion"

66
00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:05,774
"I dare to hope but one
more day"

67
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:15,254
"Who knows where we'll be
tomorrow?"

68
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:24,658
"Gift me the assurance of
your gaze!"

69
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:58,530
"Appear before me,
unveil your face"

70
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:07,270
"You alone can cure my
loneliness"

71
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:17,813
"This separation pains me"

72
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:23,674
"Let these memories sustain
my heart"

73
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:23,306
Anwar, that was terrific.

74
00:14:31,313 --> 00:14:33,850
My heart tells me
Your beloved

75
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:38,462
Must have been moved
by your song.

76
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:40,726
She must be searching for you.

77
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,128
Look over there.

78
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,976
What are you staring at ?
It's her. Go on.

79
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,309
Go ahead.

80
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,564
Anwar, what a poem that was.

81
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:21,833
We went out of our minds.
Good day.

82
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,376
She's gone.
Damn these people.

83
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,813
They just don't let 2 lovers
come together.

84
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,716
Never mind if you couldn't
see her face.

85
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:38,084
You must have got her name
and address ?

86
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,851
You didn't ?
Oh, no !

87
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:44,964
You had better forget all
about her then.

88
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,432
You won't find her in
this lifetime.

89
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,063
Because you are going
to Lucknow.

90
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:55,635
Well, that's the end of that.
Let's go.

91
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,594
Porter, wait.

92
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,892
Husna!
Keep this ticket with you.

93
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,694
I'm in the next compartment.

94
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,930
I hope I'm not troubling you.

95
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,931
Not at all.
Move, will you ?

96
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,242
Good day, Nawab.

97
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,014
I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

98
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:13,118
You don't know me.
You know my father very well.

99
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:17,153
Seth Kanhaiyalal Rastogi.
- Oh, You're Mr. RastogFs son.

100
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:19,758
Yes. Binda Din Ghayal.

101
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,730
This is my friend
Anwar Hussain Anwar.

102
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:25,330
He's also a very good poet.

103
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,864
This is Nawab Buland Akhtar.
Good day.

104
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:30,798
Please sit down.
Do sit down.

105
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:34,434
I'm so glad we met.
It'll be a pleasant journey.

106
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:37,610
Yes... We two crazy people
will have a great time.

107
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,543
But there are three of us.
- How could I call you crazy ?

108
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,703
Well, Anwar, here's Lucknow.

109
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:08,337
Don't forget your promise.
Meet me in Lucknow.

110
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,998
Very well.

111
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,638
Ghayal, why don't you
come with me?

112
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:14,974
I'll drop you on the way.

113
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:17,140
Daddy must have sent
the old rattle trap.

114
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:20,848
Gulabbo

115
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:26,053
How many times have I told you
not to yell ?

116
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm not deaf, you know.
- Move back.

117
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:32,326
Useless woman!

118
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,864
What are you staring at?
Go and tell the Begum

119
00:18:37,058 --> 00:18:39,971
A Mr. Anwar has come
from Aligarh.

120
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,503
Do sit down.
- Thank you.

121
00:18:54,509 --> 00:19:00,289
Madam, a Mr. Anwar from
Aligarh is here. - Anwar!

122
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:23,305
My brother!
- Sister!

123
00:19:25,473 --> 00:19:27,384
Bless you.

124
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,654
Have a sweetmeat, son.

125
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,658
Try this one , son.

126
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:43,400
I've had enough of this stuff.

127
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:50,302
I've a yen for something
else now.

128
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:55,406
Tell me. What would you like?
I'll send for it immediately.

129
00:19:56,171 --> 00:20:02,816
What I want...
isn't to be found in shops.

130
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:08,290
If you want to get it for me...
Then order some sorrow quickly.

131
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,021
Sorrow ?

132
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:17,670
Yes. Put sorrow on my plate,
father.

133
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:22,502
Give me tears, Mother.
To sharpen my wits.

134
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:26,873
If not for ever, at least for a
short term loan. I want that.

135
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:31,141
Very good.
Did you hear that?

136
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:34,752
Do you see the interest
our son has...

137
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:37,186
in improving the family
business?

138
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,723
This reminds me of my youth.

139
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:44,021
My father used to charge
a very small interest.

140
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:48,396
Still he doubled the business.
And I doubled it again.

141
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,399
Now my brilliant son will
increase it ten fold.

142
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:59,240
People'll say Kanhaiyalal RastogFs
son Binda din Rastogi is very -

143
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:04,316
No. Not Binda din Rastogi.
Binda din Ghayal.

144
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,616
- Ghayal ?
son, who's made you "Ghayal",

145
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,346
Where is your wound ?

146
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:12,822
This isn't a wound that
can be seen.

147
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:15,925
It can only be heard.

148
00:21:16,284 --> 00:21:18,890
Can't be seen ?
Can be heard ?

149
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:21,158
Why can't it be shown ?

150
00:21:21,256 --> 00:21:24,965
It's in a delicate place.
In my heart.

151
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:31,202
I'm Ghayal from head to toe.
From head to toe?

152
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,410
Have you got lots of wounds?

153
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,845
Did the hooligans of Aligarh
beat you up ?

154
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,575
Who dare beat me ?

155
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,783
I'm the one who beats
everyone in poetry.

156
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:45,823
I'm the best in poetry
reading sessions.

157
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm the king of poets.
Ghayal is my pen name.

158
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:51,222
Oh, so Ghayal is your
pen name?

159
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,060
Our son has become a poet.

160
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:57,101
He must be given
some sort of reward.

161
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:59,329
Do it with a generous heart.

162
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:02,874
I bow before you. Friend, give me
whatever comes to mind.

163
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:05,670
Did you hear that?
He calls his father his pal?

164
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:09,407
What are you doing ?

165
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:13,378
In order to bring me up and
educate me...

166
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,543
you were forced to become
a dancer.

167
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,417
You joined the theatre.

168
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:22,218
But by the grace of God,
our problems are over now.

169
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,192
I have completed my education.
I'm back now.

170
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,322
Now I'll look after you
And you can stay at home

171
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:31,801
God bless you.
How fine boy you are!

172
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:35,399
How much you care for me!
- You have done so much for me.

173
00:22:35,663 --> 00:22:38,769
Only a mother would do that
much for her child.

174
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:43,677
A child's heaven is at his
mother's feet.

175
00:22:43,872 --> 00:22:47,684
But my heaven is at
my sister's feet.

176
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:54,916
May every brother be
like you!

177
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,921
Anwar, I shall be madly happy-

178
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:04,035
...when you return from abroad
as great a doctor

179
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,536
...as your late father was.

180
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:10,932
I've never disobeyed you.

181
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:15,339
From childhood till now.

182
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,779
You sent me away from you.
I stayed away.

183
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,786
You didn't let me call you
my sister.

184
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,152
I've been longing to do that.

185
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,924
But I never called you sister
before anyone.

186
00:23:30,351 --> 00:23:34,629
But now I won't let you work
in the theatre.

187
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,700
And I will call you sister.

188
00:23:36,824 --> 00:23:39,304
Will you acknowledge me as
your sister ?

189
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,101
You'll lose your prestige
in society.

190
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:44,539
Society won't respect you.

191
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,976
I don't care about society.

192
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,745
Until yesterday,
I was a weakling.

193
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:53,351
I didn't have the strength
to fight the world.

194
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:57,383
But now I won't let you work.

195
00:23:57,545 --> 00:24:02,927
No, no.
My hopes will be destroyed.

196
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,223
My dreams will be
frittered away.

197
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:15,403
Anwar, my brother, for God's
sake, bring that day to mind.

198
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:19,776
Our father died.

199
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:24,211
Our relatives thought us
as good as dead.

200
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,219
They started torturing us.

201
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:33,451
Mercilessly.
They took away everything.

202
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:37,160
I took you and ran away.

203
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:41,332
Else they wouldn't have
left us alive.

204
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,571
We became homeless.

205
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:53,043
I held on to you.

206
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:56,808
I wandered from place
to place.

207
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,918
Dr. Yawar Hussain's daughter!

208
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:05,620
Suraiya became Najma
the dancer.

209
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:13,560
I want to see you reach
the highest level.

210
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:19,197
You're on the first rung of
that ladder now.

211
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:24,343
I swear by my mother.

212
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,843
I want to see you reach
such heights.

213
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:32,416
So high you can reach
for the sky.

214
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:37,219
May happiness rain upon you.

215
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:41,087
May wealth and prosperity
surround you.

216
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:43,525
May our family rise again.

217
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,329
My dear sister !

218
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:54,732
Come in.

219
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,002
Sir, this house has been
closed for 5 years.

220
00:25:57,131 --> 00:25:59,133
Many people have tried
to get it.

221
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,144
But I had decided.

222
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:05,442
I would give it only to
people with character.

223
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,119
You judged us very well.

224
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,750
I have experience.
lam a man of the world.

225
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,554
Have a look around.

226
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:19,790
Don't think too long.
Rent it quickly.

227
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,900
By God, it's a lucky house.

228
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:46,150
My God ! What a view to the west.
I'm shaken from head to foot.

229
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:49,394
Come. Tell me if it's a girl
or a vision.

230
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:57,669
Oh no. The door's closed now.

231
00:26:57,925 --> 00:26:59,768
Ghayal, you're crazy!

232
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:03,974
You can't stare at people
in your neighbourhood.

233
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:06,612
The neighbours will finish
you if they notice.

234
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:09,342
Idea !
- Get inside.

235
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:15,916
We like the people in
the neighbourhood.

236
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:18,723
Here's the advance.
The house is mine now.

237
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:22,986
Advance from me too. When he
leaves the house, I'll take it

238
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:25,961
We'll close the western
window and open the eastern.

239
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:28,827
Thank you.

240
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,832
Now don't ponder too much.

241
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:33,802
Everything you need to
write poetry is here.

242
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,565
Forget your beloved.

243
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:40,041
Write a restless and intense
love poem.

244
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:41,704
Ghayal ?
Go on.

245
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,976
Do you - I know what you're
about to say.

246
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:48,485
What ?
That I have great ideas.

247
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:49,884
Not at all.
Then ?

248
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:52,719
You're a very handsome idiot!

249
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:56,361
One idiot recognizes another!

250
00:27:56,517 --> 00:28:00,693
Let's shake hands at that!

251
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:03,093
Ouch! what's this ?

252
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,983
You -_>

253
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:27,023
MY dear !

254
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,005
Husna, when I look at you...

255
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:43,732
...I'm angry with God.
- Why ?

256
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:46,511
Why didn't he make me a boy ?

257
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:51,079
I'd have surrendered to
your beauty.

258
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:57,952
And do you know what I'd do?
- What ?

259
00:29:01,482 --> 00:29:04,827
Get lost!
You're utterly shameless.

260
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:13,671
Tell me, what happenned about
that admirer of yours?

261
00:29:13,861 --> 00:29:16,398
The one you bumped into. The one
you wrote to me about.

262
00:29:16,564 --> 00:29:20,068
He walked past me so
many times.

263
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:24,075
I wanted to talk to him.

264
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:27,219
But I just couldn't.
I was too shy.

265
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:30,083
Shyness, and that too
with an admirer!

266
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:32,623
You could have dropped your
hankerchief. Or bumped into him.

267
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:35,751
You could have let him
see your face.

268
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,090
That happened one day.
He was close.

269
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,861
Great !
He kept gazing at me.

270
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,560
Good for him !

271
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:48,138
I kept gazing at him.
- Good for you too !

272
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:53,677
We were lost in each other.
- That's great !

273
00:29:53,901 --> 00:29:55,812
Then we heard someone
approaching.

274
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:59,473
I got scared and ran away.
- Oh no.

275
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,344
He didn't ask my address.
Nor did I ask his.

276
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:07,923
Then this love story ends
before it begins.

277
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:14,757
My dear, you'll know when you
fall in love.

278
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,400
You call it the end.

279
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:20,870
But's it's only the beginning
of the love story.

280
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,177
"You are somewhere near"

281
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:38,051
"But oh so far"

282
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:47,295
"The pain of separation
weakens me"

283
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:55,639
"This is the state of my heart"

284
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:58,207
"For I'm in love with you"

285
00:30:58,366 --> 00:31:00,869
"God alone knows howl feel"

286
00:31:26,661 --> 00:31:31,804
"I think of you all day"

287
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:36,379
"And cannot sleep at night"

288
00:31:36,637 --> 00:31:39,015
"This sweet pain permeates
my being"

289
00:31:43,911 --> 00:31:49,452
"I wonder what awaits me"

290
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:30,294
"You are my life"

291
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:36,370
"I hope to meet and talk
to my heart's content"

292
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:29,892
"Mend this broken heart
of mine"

293
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:35,384
"I am restless with longing"

294
00:33:48,936 --> 00:33:58,050
"I yearn for you"

295
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,459
I am sorry.

296
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:40,666
Blind idiot, loafer, hooligan.

297
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:42,061
Thank you.

298
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:46,903
You've awarded me several
titles in one breath.

299
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:50,338
Actually, I have a very
short name.

300
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:53,807
Ghayal (wounded).
Wounded by a lovely gaze.

301
00:34:54,034 --> 00:34:56,173
Wounded by good breeding
and honour.

302
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,509
Wounded by beautiful eyes.
- Oh! You shut up.

303
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,616
You speak English very well.

304
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:07,824
Aticket! I say!
Listen.

305
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,555
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself ?

306
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:14,699
Actually, I'm a very
shy person.

307
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,732
But I'm forced to set
my shyness aside.

308
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:20,136
Are you going to the theatre?
- What is it to you ?

309
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:23,503
I have the ticket here.

310
00:35:23,697 --> 00:35:25,938
You keep one.
I'll keep one.

311
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:28,943
We'll watch the show together.
- You really are shameless.

312
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:34,613
What's your problem ?

313
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:37,948
You yell because of me.
I'm very sorry.

314
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,486
I hope you didn't get hurt.

315
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:43,354
Don't offer sympathy from
a distance. Come closer.

316
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:44,892
Then I can tell you.

317
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,532
What a hand !

318
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:52,931
One slap!
And I'm seeing stars.

319
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:01,173
Anwar, I won the battle.

320
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,143
V for victory.

321
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:05,543
Answer me where ever you are.
I for- - ?

322
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:08,449
Loafer, lout,
lightweight, louse.

323
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:11,953
Not loafer. Not lout.
Not lightweight. Not louse.

324
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:18,728
I for love. Tenderness. Passion
Worship.

325
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:21,829
O, so you've been smitten too.

326
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:24,161
You've decided to
fall in love?

327
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:29,035
Don't talk rubbish. You don't
decide to fall in love. It happens.

328
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:31,708
I bumped into a girl today.

329
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:37,474
Exactly what happened to you.
We bumped into each other.

330
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:44,122
She fell down.
And said - Oh God !

331
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:49,785
Just as your girl in purdah
had said. Oh Allah!

332
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:53,488
What an interesting story.
What happened next, pal?

333
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:58,897
Next ? I went closer.
She was coy.

334
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:01,437
I extended my hand.

335
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,769
The velvet like hands held
on to it.

336
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:11,108
My heart beat faster. Bells
started ringing in my head.

337
00:37:12,573 --> 00:37:15,110
Lies. All lies.

338
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:18,481
You bumped into her.
I accept that.

339
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:21,489
She fell down.
I believe it.

340
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:25,754
She said " Oh God "
I can trust you on that too.

341
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:29,901
You gazed into her eyes?
- Yes.

342
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,537
You held her hand to help her up.
- Correct.

343
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:37,903
She tried to release her hand.
Absolutely correct.

344
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:39,577
And then"

345
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,111
With great feeling...
With great force...

346
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:46,376
She gave you a slap!
- How did you find out ?

347
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,011
Rastogi, your face still
carries the mark !

348
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:54,090
Your cheek is red.
- Never mind.

349
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:56,158
I've had one slap so far.

350
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,853
I'm fifty percent in love
with her.

351
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:01,259
With the next one it will be
hundred per cent.

352
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:02,765
Come with me.
- Where to?

353
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,201
Just come.
- Let me wear my coat at least.

354
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:20,610
"Love has been brought to
such a state today"

355
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:26,075
"it has become a matter of
prestige rather than emotion"

356
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:39,168
"God save me from
such young men"

357
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:48,406
"Brash young men without
any depth"

358
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:53,415
"The rogues gaze into our eyes
and sigh"

359
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:57,020
"They use any means to
entice us"

360
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:25,144
"They roam the streets,
singing of their love"

361
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:41,524
"They barter their hearts
at every turn"

362
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:52,733
"Their love is false, as is
their passion"

363
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:56,745
"Better keep away
from such men"

364
00:39:57,204 --> 00:40:01,118
"God save me from such
young men!"

365
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:27,375
"They wangle their way
into our hearts"

366
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:42,556
"But before you know it,
they're gone!"

367
00:40:49,423 --> 00:40:52,370
"They build up a relationship
when the whim takes them"

368
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,003
"And break it up
when boredom strikes"

369
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:58,598
"I've had quite enough of
such men!"

370
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:08,384
Wow, what a performance!
- She can certainly dance!

371
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:25,292
"No one recognizes
the flame of love"

372
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:37,744
"They want to experience
the fire of love"

373
00:41:38,138 --> 00:41:40,584
"But they know not what
love is"

374
00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:52,160
"The woman is heart-broken,
dishonoured, disgraced"

375
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:55,959
"Save me from such
two-faced lovers!"

376
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,117
What's wrong ?
You look upset.

377
00:42:55,349 --> 00:42:57,955
No. It's nothing.

378
00:43:28,115 --> 00:43:31,653
You knew this would happen.

379
00:43:31,852 --> 00:43:33,923
You would see me on stage.

380
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:37,261
And you wouldn't be able
to stand it.

381
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:39,928
You shouldn't have come.

382
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:49,741
I know.

383
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:53,908
You must have visualised
our ruin.

384
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:59,218
Seen you sister destroyed by it.

385
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:03,658
Your pride must have been hurt.
Your blood must have boiled.

386
00:44:04,951 --> 00:44:11,766
I saw the tatters of your
reputation.

387
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,768
I heard your voice.
It was a plaintive call.

388
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:18,375
But for others -
It was just a show.

389
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,573
You're not in your right
senses, Anwar.

390
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,770
Go, go home.

391
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,785
I won't.
Until you make a promise.

392
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:32,189
Leave the stage forever.

393
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,356
Bless you. You're the finest
brother ever.

394
00:44:38,485 --> 00:44:41,091
I promise.

395
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:44,201
The day my hopes are
fulfilled...

396
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:49,636
when you become a doctor,
I will leave the stage.

397
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:52,072
I don't want to be a doctor.

398
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,805
I'm neither hungry for money
nor fame.

399
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:57,140
I don't want the world to bow
before me.

400
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:00,651
Nor do I want to reach
the skies.

401
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:06,223
I only want to love and respect
my sister.

402
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,488
I beg of you.

403
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:12,387
Only give me the rest of
your hopes.

404
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:14,930
I want to realise them
for you.

405
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:21,106
Don't be childish.

406
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:24,799
So you won't leave the theatre.
Don't.

407
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:28,275
I wish you the very best.
I am going.

408
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:34,183
You have given meour
decision. Now hear mine.

409
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:36,111
You'll never see me
after today.

410
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,813
I'll kill myself.
Good bye.

411
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:44,956
Anwar, take back those words,

412
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:49,489
Don't ever say those words.

413
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:54,269
I'll leave the stage.

414
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:03,572
Forever.

415
00:46:07,007 --> 00:46:08,509
What's wrong, Husna?

416
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:12,348
Ever since you've come back
from Aligarh, you are very quiet.

417
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:15,752
What else I can do in this
huge house?

418
00:46:16,216 --> 00:46:18,389
What do you mean ?

419
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:23,224
If only I had a sister-in-law.

420
00:46:24,057 --> 00:46:27,937
There would be children.

421
00:46:29,129 --> 00:46:34,169
It would be lively.
I would be happy too.

422
00:46:34,768 --> 00:46:37,374
You're aware of my
problem, Husna.

423
00:46:37,537 --> 00:46:39,244
The woman I love...

424
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:41,443
can't be made mistress of
this house.

425
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:44,749
But you always said...

426
00:46:44,911 --> 00:46:47,414
that she comes from a good family.

427
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:50,388
Why can't she become mistress
of this house ?

428
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:54,561
No one cares for her
excellent past.

429
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:59,495
They only know what
Najma is today.

430
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,277
I'm dying

431
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:19,424
What happened?
- Pain. In half my face.

432
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,217
I can't sleep at night.

433
00:47:21,414 --> 00:47:23,792
I can't stay awake during
the day.

434
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:27,193
You're responsible for the pain.
Find me the medicine too!

435
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:28,958
I'll cure you right now.
- Thank you.

436
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:36,407
Since you slapped me,
I've been in love with you.

437
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:39,538
I am further in love with you.

438
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,672
My God, are you a poet?

439
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:45,214
Yes. Here's a new one.

440
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:48,252
Whenever we meet,
you slap me.

441
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:50,548
My love, let's meet elsewhere.

442
00:47:50,877 --> 00:47:52,914
What do you think ?

443
00:47:58,218 --> 00:48:00,459
Buy this handkerchief.
It's useful to drop.

444
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,293
How much is it ?

445
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,368
25 paise for the scarf,
75 paise for the idea.

446
00:48:04,491 --> 00:48:06,994
That's brilliant.

447
00:48:08,495 --> 00:48:12,841
Anwar, I scored an
equaliser.

448
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:15,377
She gave me another slap.

449
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:18,277
As she was walking away,
I recited a poem to her.

450
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:22,409
She stopped and smiled.

451
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:27,216
She dropped her handkerchief
and left.

452
00:48:27,347 --> 00:48:30,624
I'm crazy about love too now.

453
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,661
Just as you are.

454
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,492
Your love says "Oh Allah".

455
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,362
Mine says "Oh Ram".

456
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:39,268
He's got up and gone.

457
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:41,167
He takes no interest in
my romance.

458
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:46,209
Love isn't the only problem
in life.

459
00:48:46,566 --> 00:48:51,242
Majnu only had one problem -
Laila.

460
00:48:51,404 --> 00:48:54,749
But what is your
other problem ?

461
00:48:54,908 --> 00:48:56,979
Tell me.

462
00:48:58,578 --> 00:49:00,580
I want to find a job, Ghayal.

463
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,056
A job ?
Are you abandoning your studies ?

464
00:49:03,183 --> 00:49:05,288
Yes. I need it.

465
00:49:05,552 --> 00:49:07,031
A job is available.

466
00:49:07,187 --> 00:49:09,167
But I need a good recommendation.

467
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:11,200
I know the wealthiest man
in town.

468
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:13,132
Who's that ?
- My father.

469
00:49:14,794 --> 00:49:17,035
His recommendation won't do.

470
00:49:17,197 --> 00:49:20,201
I need someone respected in
government circles.

471
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,973
That's true. My father is
a money lender.

472
00:49:27,907 --> 00:49:32,413
It's a good idea. Read on.

473
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:40,664
My love does not make me proud.

474
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,164
Love is a natural state.

475
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:46,896
Husna. You've got the word wrong.

476
00:49:47,427 --> 00:49:49,964
Why don't you consult
a good poet.

477
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,101
You'll correct your mistakes
and improve your style.

478
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:55,779
Sir, someone is here to meet you.

479
00:49:55,935 --> 00:49:57,710
Invite him in.

480
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:08,821
You? Come in.

481
00:50:12,252 --> 00:50:14,129
How do you do, sir ?
- Bless you, Anwar.

482
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:15,630
Namaste, sir.

483
00:50:15,788 --> 00:50:17,927
How are you, Ghayal ?
- Still wounded, Ghayal.

484
00:50:18,591 --> 00:50:20,901
I'm so glad to see you.

485
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:26,375
But I do have a complaint.

486
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:28,909
You've taken a long time
coming to see me.

487
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:30,912
What could I do ?

488
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,449
Since coming to Lucknow,
we've had problems.

489
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:35,619
I hope all is well.
Tell me about it.

490
00:50:35,775 --> 00:50:37,914
The thing is

491
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:40,214
What is it, Ghayal?

492
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,795
The Azad Press publishes
a newspaper,"Youth".

493
00:50:44,918 --> 00:50:47,023
They need an editor.

494
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,530
He is hoping to get
the appointment.

495
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:53,432
Mr Murlidharan, the owner of
the press, is a good friend.

496
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:55,368
I'll phone him right now.

497
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,213
Azad Press? Can I speak to
Mr. Murlidharan ?

498
00:51:09,376 --> 00:51:11,583
Murli, is that you?

499
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:14,189
I believe -
- Yes, I'm fine.

500
00:51:14,347 --> 00:51:17,453
I believe you need an editor
for your paper.

501
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,529
My close friend has put in
an application.

502
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:23,358
Mirza Anwar Hussain.

503
00:51:23,523 --> 00:51:25,662
I think he should get the job.

504
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:27,929
I'd be very grateful.

505
00:51:28,094 --> 00:51:30,335
Thank you so much.

506
00:51:34,033 --> 00:51:36,570
There you are.
It's done.

507
00:51:36,736 --> 00:51:38,841
Do sit down.

508
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:41,517
I'm obliged to you.

509
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:44,314
Not at all.
It was my duty.

510
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,187
Say what you will.
But Anwar is very grateful.

511
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:51,521
Look, he's bowed his head too!

512
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:53,960
If he stands up, he'll start
bowing to you.

513
00:51:54,854 --> 00:51:58,427
Actually, there is something
you could do for me.

514
00:51:58,692 --> 00:52:00,433
It'll be my pleasure, sir.

515
00:52:00,727 --> 00:52:03,833
My sister is very fond of poetry.

516
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,407
If you don't mind, comment
on her work sometimes.

517
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:14,143
He doesn't deserve the honour.
But he'll do it.

518
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,311
You're very witty, Mr. Ghayal.
- So are my poems.

519
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:23,324
One who's depressed
and thinking of suicide

520
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:29,263
should love someone
who's been bitten by a mad dog.

521
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:34,937
You were slow with your laughter.

522
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:37,074
It was a difficult poem.

523
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:48,385
You left the theatre
because I asked you to.

524
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:50,383
I'm so glad.

525
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:00,927
If you can, do one
more thing for me.

526
00:53:01,454 --> 00:53:04,799
I swear it'll be my last request.

527
00:53:04,991 --> 00:53:07,801
Let him make requests
who cannot command.

528
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:10,767
You can ask for my
very life.

529
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:16,346
I don't want to take life away.
But to gift it.

530
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:18,844
You gave me life...

531
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:23,452
...the day you gazed into
my eyes.

532
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:28,284
That wasn't a gift of love.

533
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:29,927
It was love.

534
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:32,051
Let me finish.

535
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:34,562
Your love is my life.

536
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,798
No, Najma. My love is death
for you, not life.

537
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:44,101
Only the fortunate
receive such death.

538
00:53:44,998 --> 00:53:47,342
Don't try to reassure me, Najma.

539
00:53:47,533 --> 00:53:52,778
My love is a trap that
has ensnared you.

540
00:53:53,039 --> 00:54:00,355
But I won't let you be ruined.

541
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,356
I'll sacrifice my life for you.

542
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:09,298
Your wit has taken
a new turn today.

543
00:54:09,689 --> 00:54:12,636
This is no witticism.

544
00:54:12,925 --> 00:54:15,872
It's reality I'm talking about.

545
00:54:16,596 --> 00:54:21,944
Even if I want to
marry you, I can not.

546
00:54:23,436 --> 00:54:27,748
I come from an old and
respected family.

547
00:54:28,107 --> 00:54:30,610
No one has ever done anything...

548
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,086
...to taint the family's
reputation.

549
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:41,095
It has always been said...

550
00:54:41,387 --> 00:54:44,766
...the sun and moon may be
blemished...

551
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:49,873
...but this family's reputation
is spotless.

552
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,773
Tell me, Najma.

553
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,277
How can I marry a girl...

554
00:54:56,436 --> 00:55:01,181
...seen to have a tainted
character?

555
00:55:01,374 --> 00:55:03,285
I swear before you

556
00:55:04,277 --> 00:55:10,819
I have never even dreamed
of becoming your wife.

557
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:18,227
Don't use my
welfare as an excuse.

558
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:21,032
Don't turn away from me.

559
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,001
If you abandon me...

560
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:26,803
...the light will disappear
from my life.

561
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:30,607
No, Najma.
Believe me.

562
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:34,411
There is hope in
your tomorrows.

563
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:38,053
Everyone is not as helpless
as I am.

564
00:55:38,411 --> 00:55:43,884
Najma, marry someone.

565
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:52,797
Love doesn't consider
marriage necessary.

566
00:55:53,092 --> 00:55:56,733
Najma, why don't you
understand?

567
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,772
Leave me to my devices.

568
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:03,502
Arrange your life.
Settle down.

569
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:07,081
Your family needs an heir.

570
00:56:07,273 --> 00:56:11,415
An heir to bring glory
to the family.

571
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:17,289
The spotless reputation of
the family will remain.

572
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:23,066
I only wish for darkness
to envelop us...

573
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:30,106
to overtake ancient
families like ours.

574
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:36,207
We are guilty of destruction.

575
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:44,552
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

576
00:56:59,025 --> 00:57:02,632
Please do sit down.
- Thank you.

577
00:57:05,398 --> 00:57:07,503
I hope you're not upset.

578
00:57:08,034 --> 00:57:11,811
No, I know you're my
brother's friend.

579
00:57:13,439 --> 00:57:16,386
I present a few of my poems
for your opinion.

580
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,981
Here they are.

581
00:57:28,054 --> 00:57:30,227
Excuse me.

582
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:32,300
Before I comment on these

583
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,904
I'd like to hear you recite
work by other poets.

584
00:57:35,895 --> 00:57:40,469
I'd like to guage your taste.

585
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:44,304
Only a few days ago

586
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:49,282
I was lucky enough to hear
...a beautiful song.

587
00:57:49,976 --> 00:57:52,820
It has found a place in my heart.

588
00:57:52,945 --> 00:57:54,253
Excellent.

589
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:56,220
Recite it.

590
00:57:56,716 --> 00:58:00,789
It's called "My Beloved".

591
00:58:02,588 --> 00:58:06,968
"My beloved, I swear
upon your love"

592
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:13,435
Where did you hear this song?
Tell me quickly.

593
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:15,943
It carries the secret
of somebody's love.

594
00:58:16,135 --> 00:58:18,274
Whose secret?

595
00:58:18,738 --> 00:58:23,312
The secret of my friend's love.

596
00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:26,112
Do you know your friend?

597
00:58:26,345 --> 00:58:29,121
Would I call him my friend
if I didn't?

598
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:31,386
But why are you asking
about him?

599
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,760
I'm Not for myself.

600
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:37,868
I ask for my friend.

601
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:43,336
The truth is, this song
is important to her.

602
00:58:43,496 --> 00:58:45,703
It's a memory of her love.

603
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:49,005
This song was written
for my friend.

604
00:58:49,201 --> 00:58:52,239
Does she study at Aligarh?
- Yes.

605
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:56,882
Then she's the one.
- Who?

606
00:58:57,243 --> 00:59:01,214
She's the one for whom my
friend weeps.

607
00:59:01,447 --> 00:59:06,487
His tears are at the heart
of this poem.

608
00:59:07,053 --> 00:59:12,628
Separated from her,
he is so restless.

609
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:16,134
So is my friend.

610
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,840
She cannot sleep.

611
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:22,706
Nor can she rest.

612
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:26,013
She keeps repeating
this prayer.

613
00:59:27,306 --> 00:59:29,980
Dear God.

614
00:59:30,242 --> 00:59:32,848
If meeting him is not
in my fate...

615
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:34,920
...then grant me death.

616
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,219
Don't say that.

617
00:59:37,383 --> 00:59:40,956
May your friend live long.

618
00:59:42,555 --> 00:59:44,398
Now, tell me.

619
00:59:44,557 --> 00:59:49,973
Would you like to help
these lovers ..to meet again?

620
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:52,768
They're restless without each other.

621
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:54,273
Why not?

622
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:56,572
It's a question of my
friend's life.

623
00:59:56,736 --> 00:59:58,579
Tell me what I can do.

624
00:59:58,704 --> 01:00:00,115
As soon as you can

625
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,378
Give her my friend's regards.

626
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:05,078
I'll go to her today
as fast as I can.

627
01:00:05,344 --> 01:00:07,119
Please give my regards -

628
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,190
I mean, my friend's regards
to your friend.

629
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,421
Bless you.

630
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,870
Ghayau

631
01:00:23,863 --> 01:00:27,675
Are you in your senses?
- You bet I am!

632
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,870
Then talk sensibly.

633
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:32,778
Ghayal, I saw the sun rise
in the west today.

634
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:35,847
I saw rain rising from the earth.

635
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:38,747
There was a harvest
in the sky.

636
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:40,355
That's done it.

637
01:00:40,613 --> 01:00:42,183
You've gone crazy.

638
01:00:42,548 --> 01:00:45,825
I'll tear your shirt

639
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:49,122
The urchins on the street
will stone you for sure

640
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,699
Do you know what my
beloved will say?

641
01:00:51,924 --> 01:00:55,565
Don't throw stones
at my lover

642
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:57,035
You mean you met her?

643
01:00:57,163 --> 01:00:58,471
What do you think I'm
talking about?

644
01:00:58,597 --> 01:01:00,008
Then say Oh Allah!
- Oh Allah!

645
01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:02,101
Oh Ram!
- Oh Allah!

646
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:12,452
Listen, will you?

647
01:01:12,912 --> 01:01:14,892
What is this?
Have you gone mad?

648
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:16,716
Yes.

649
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:20,022
What? Have you found him?
- Yes.

650
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,392
May he father a dozen children.

651
01:01:22,555 --> 01:01:23,863
Shameless hussy!

652
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:26,902
I'm talking about
my poetry tutor.

653
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:31,267
He's a friend of his.

654
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:36,406
Naseem, what a lucky
day this is!

655
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,948
I feel like singing, dancing,
painting Lucknow red.

656
01:01:40,472 --> 01:01:44,852
So, she's a friend of
the Nawab's sister.

657
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:49,218
That's right.
You know how I yearn for her?

658
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:53,761
She's in the same state over me.

659
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,491
"My beloved..."

660
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:06,239
"I swear upon your love"

661
01:06:38,804 --> 01:06:43,116
We've been looking everywhere
for this girl

662
01:06:43,308 --> 01:06:45,185
And she's right here,
our neighbour!

663
01:06:46,445 --> 01:06:49,255
I have to hand it to you.
You're a lucky man.

664
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:44,830
Did you send my regards on?

665
01:08:44,963 --> 01:08:46,533
Your regards?

666
01:08:46,598 --> 01:08:49,340
I mean, my friend's regards.

667
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,242
Yes.

668
01:08:51,503 --> 01:08:53,813
She sent her regards too.

669
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:56,248
Is that all? Didn't she
say anything else?

670
01:08:56,508 --> 01:09:02,220
Plenty. But let's hear
yours first.

671
01:09:02,614 --> 01:09:05,686
I passed on your friend's message.

672
01:09:06,151 --> 01:09:11,464
His face lit up,
his eyes brightened.

673
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,860
Oh Allah! And then?

674
01:09:14,092 --> 01:09:20,202
Finally anxiety was
replaced by calm.

675
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:23,376
When I went to deliver
the message...

676
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:31,486
...she was depressed,
despairing over her love.

677
01:09:33,011 --> 01:09:37,426
I told her not to cry.

678
01:09:38,016 --> 01:09:41,520
That I would brighten up
her life...

679
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,726
"with the message I brought.

680
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:46,767
Then what happened?

681
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:52,199
Finally anxiety was
replaced by calm.

682
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:54,309
What is your friend's name?

683
01:09:54,433 --> 01:09:57,277
What? My friend?

684
01:09:57,503 --> 01:09:59,676
Naseemara.

685
01:09:59,838 --> 01:10:04,719
Naseemara? What a lovely name.

686
01:10:04,977 --> 01:10:07,287
The Nawab is here.

687
01:10:08,547 --> 01:10:10,686
Good day.
- How are you, Anwar?

688
01:10:10,883 --> 01:10:12,624
I hope you are well.

689
01:10:12,784 --> 01:10:15,822
Is your pen name Anwar?

690
01:10:16,021 --> 01:10:18,797
Oh, I quite forgot to
tell you his name.

691
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:22,470
His name is
Anwar Hussain Anwar.

692
01:10:24,896 --> 01:10:26,569
What's so surprising?

693
01:10:26,765 --> 01:10:30,770
It seems familiar somehow.

694
01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:33,040
It should be.

695
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:35,845
You study at Aligarh
and so does Anwar.

696
01:10:36,008 --> 01:10:40,957
Besides, he's well known as a
poet at the university.

697
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:43,387
Does she study at Aligarh?
- She does.

698
01:10:43,582 --> 01:10:45,118
And your friend Naseemara?

699
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:47,958
Naseemara? No, she doesn't
study at Aligarh. Why?

700
01:10:48,153 --> 01:10:51,532
She told me she'd heard my
song from her.

701
01:10:51,723 --> 01:10:55,762
It didn't take her long
to fool you!

702
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:00,232
She's full of mischief!

703
01:11:00,365 --> 01:11:03,471
She heard it herself at Aligarh.
She hums it day and night.

704
01:11:03,602 --> 01:11:07,015
And she told you she got it
from her friend!

705
01:11:07,272 --> 01:11:10,310
Oh Allah! Many thanks to you.

706
01:11:10,609 --> 01:11:15,354
You brought my beloved to me.

707
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:22,327
Accompaniment is available.
You have a good voice.

708
01:11:22,454 --> 01:11:24,798
And I have a request.

709
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,560
It's my pleasure, Nawab.

710
01:11:26,692 --> 01:11:29,070
Sing one of your new
songs for me.

711
01:11:53,585 --> 01:11:58,585
"Wake up, my beauty,
Let love awaken you"

712
01:12:11,003 --> 01:12:16,003
"You could change my destiny
Once you are roused"

713
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:54,921
"I come full of hope"

714
01:12:55,214 --> 01:13:02,098
"To sings my songs of
love to you"

715
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:14,304
"Don't let disappointment
come my way"

716
01:13:37,456 --> 01:13:46,001
"Inspire a melody in my heart"

717
01:13:46,264 --> 01:13:53,773
"Come, sing with me"

718
01:13:55,307 --> 01:14:02,987
"I come to you, full of hope"

719
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:34,184
"You are the flame
I surrender to"

720
01:14:34,446 --> 01:14:41,557
"I long to be consumed
in your fire"

721
01:15:19,257 --> 01:15:23,000
That was marvellous, Anwar.

722
01:16:04,069 --> 01:16:06,606
You don't realise how badly

723
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:09,650
The world needs the
balm of poetry,

724
01:16:09,808 --> 01:16:11,651
lnspite of the U N O,

725
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:14,188
the world is full of war
and violence.

726
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:16,451
I have started this
Poet's Club...

727
01:16:16,648 --> 01:16:18,958
"because I'm sure this
club of ours...

728
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:21,154
...will surely replace
the U N one day.

729
01:16:21,353 --> 01:16:23,264
Ask me how.
- How ?

730
01:16:23,822 --> 01:16:26,962
Breakfast is on its way.
- How ?

731
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:30,772
The poet's thoughts are sensitive.

732
01:16:31,062 --> 01:16:33,099
His temperament is sensitive.
His heart is sensitive.

733
01:16:33,432 --> 01:16:37,346
So if we popularise poetry
all over the world...

734
01:16:37,502 --> 01:16:40,642
sensitivity will be the
order of the day.

735
01:16:40,939 --> 01:16:45,410
Where the sensitive reign,
can there be violence ?

736
01:16:45,877 --> 01:16:47,447
Tell me.

737
01:16:48,613 --> 01:16:51,890
Think of your breakfast.
- Never.

738
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:55,658
To popularize poetry...

739
01:16:55,854 --> 01:16:59,301
my father's wealth is
available.

740
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:02,737
As soon as we can
please my father...

741
01:17:02,894 --> 01:17:05,738
the fate of poetry
will improve.

742
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,934
And then every poet will
receive a new shirt

743
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,771
A new pair of pyjamas

744
01:17:10,936 --> 01:17:13,348
And as much betel nut
as they want.

745
01:17:13,572 --> 01:17:16,781
Eat betel nut in peace
And recite your poetry.

746
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:21,113
Ask why.
- Why ?

747
01:17:21,379 --> 01:17:27,660
Because I love poetry.
Poetry is my life.

748
01:18:01,419 --> 01:18:04,161
What an excellent proposal
this is!

749
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:08,165
You won't get a better
proposal for your son.

750
01:18:08,326 --> 01:18:10,101
How's the girl?

751
01:18:10,295 --> 01:18:12,707
She's about 16 or 17

752
01:18:12,831 --> 01:18:17,974
16-17 lakhs of rupees or
16-17 crores of rupees ?

753
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:22,448
No. The girl's age
is 16-17 years.

754
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:28,682
However, the girl's father has
some 40-50 lakhs of rupees.

755
01:18:31,049 --> 01:18:32,995
How many brothers and sisters
does she have?

756
01:18:33,151 --> 01:18:35,688
She's the only child.
- The only child ?

757
01:18:35,821 --> 01:18:38,529
In that case, find an
auspicious date.

758
01:18:38,623 --> 01:18:40,625
That can come later.

759
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:42,762
Tell me.

760
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:44,534
I hope the girl doesn't have
any faults ?

761
01:18:44,629 --> 01:18:46,609
No particular fault.

762
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:50,338
She's a fine girl.
She's a healthy girl.

763
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:54,507
The only thing is
She lost an eye as a child.

764
01:18:54,739 --> 01:18:57,379
One-eyed ?
- Never mind.

765
01:18:57,576 --> 01:19:02,150
We'll have a glass eye fixed.
Turqoise blue.

766
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,393
Look for a date.

767
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:08,655
I refuse to sell my Binda
for money.

768
01:19:08,853 --> 01:19:12,357
Why not? His father did the same.

769
01:19:12,557 --> 01:19:15,800
If your father hadn't
shelled out Rs. 100,000...

770
01:19:15,994 --> 01:19:17,632
I wouldn't have looked

771
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:19,503
I'd have married a beauty.

772
01:19:19,731 --> 01:19:23,338
Look at yourself.
You dare to speak like that!

773
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:25,505
Your father came begging to us.

774
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,413
Don't lie!

775
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:30,814
Your father begged for our consent.

776
01:19:31,009 --> 01:19:33,250
This wedding will take place.

777
01:19:33,478 --> 01:19:37,016
Should I proceed with the matter?

778
01:19:37,115 --> 01:19:40,426
Absolutely.
With all speed.

779
01:19:40,585 --> 01:19:44,055
Tell them we're interested.

780
01:19:45,123 --> 01:19:48,332
Don't cry. I'm alive yet.

781
01:19:54,632 --> 01:19:58,774
Where are you taking all
these snacks and tea?

782
01:19:58,937 --> 01:20:01,474
Your son has started
a Poets' Club.

783
01:20:01,706 --> 01:20:04,687
Lots of poets have gathered.
All this is meant for them

784
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,345
A Poets' Club?

785
01:20:06,511 --> 01:20:08,582
You mean I have poets
in the house?

786
01:20:08,713 --> 01:20:13,093
My hard earned money is
feeding poets?

787
01:20:13,251 --> 01:20:15,322
I won't let them eat this.

788
01:20:15,453 --> 01:20:17,262
I'll starve each one of them.

789
01:20:26,398 --> 01:20:30,107
Where's my stick?
Let go.

790
01:20:32,604 --> 01:20:36,484
What will you do to my son?
- I'll beat him black and blue.

791
01:20:36,675 --> 01:20:39,815
I'll give him the beating
of his life.

792
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:41,548
No, no!

793
01:20:48,286 --> 01:20:51,096
That was great!

794
01:20:51,356 --> 01:20:57,432
All right.
Any other poem?

795
01:20:57,595 --> 01:20:59,370
Do listen to one of mine.

796
01:20:59,564 --> 01:21:03,876
Balancing a pot on
her head, Heer slipped

797
01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:06,482
straight into Ranjhefs heart.

798
01:21:08,273 --> 01:21:13,188
You have tried a little wordplay.

799
01:21:13,344 --> 01:21:16,086
But in the legend
of Heer and Ranjha...

800
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:19,628
...this is how you
could phrase it.

801
01:21:25,456 --> 01:21:28,562
Ranjhefs heart slipped
out of his shirt...

802
01:21:29,727 --> 01:21:31,866
and was enmeshed in
Heer's tresses.

803
01:21:33,531 --> 01:21:37,274
I managed to slip out
with my stick.

804
01:21:37,402 --> 01:21:40,008
Your mother didn't care for
my trick.

805
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:43,481
The spitting image of a poet!

806
01:21:43,641 --> 01:21:46,144
The look of penury.
Tattered clothes.

807
01:21:46,244 --> 01:21:53,025
Let's carry him in procession.

808
01:21:53,485 --> 01:21:55,761
We'll go through the neighbourhood.

809
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:08,731
My beloved!

810
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:12,742
"My beloved...
I swear upon my love"

811
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:16,842
"Let your beautiful eyes
assure me of your love"

812
01:23:17,101 --> 01:23:21,743
"And return my lost joy to me"

813
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:33,751
Let me go.

814
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:36,593
If anyone sees us, it'll
be embarrassing.

815
01:23:38,423 --> 01:23:39,993
Let me go!

816
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:42,605
Husna!

817
01:24:04,849 --> 01:24:09,849
"The nightmare of separation
is over"

818
01:24:16,995 --> 01:24:21,569
" I've found you"

819
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:27,274
"The pilgrimage is over"

820
01:24:33,278 --> 01:24:42,255
"I reveal my feelings to you"

821
01:24:43,688 --> 01:24:48,688
"I hardly know how
it all happened!"

822
01:25:08,846 --> 01:25:13,591
"I lose myself in your beauty"

823
01:25:14,052 --> 01:25:18,694
"I unveil my secret to you"

824
01:25:49,821 --> 01:25:56,431
"This is the best thing that
has ever happened to me!"

825
01:25:56,694 --> 01:26:01,939
"Cupid's arrow has pierced
my heart,"

826
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:10,052
"You are responsible
for the wound"

827
01:26:10,308 --> 01:26:16,748
"I think of a lifetime
with you"

828
01:26:43,608 --> 01:26:47,988
"How charming,
how impish you are"

829
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:56,894
"Lucky is the man who
wins you!"

830
01:27:51,576 --> 01:27:53,078
"He's the one"

831
01:27:53,244 --> 01:27:55,815
Wait.

832
01:27:57,048 --> 01:28:01,224
Where are you going?
Come here.

833
01:28:04,589 --> 01:28:06,694
You coward! Why are you
trembling ?

834
01:28:06,857 --> 01:28:09,804
Do you know this girl ?
- No. Never seen her.

835
01:28:09,961 --> 01:28:12,908
Who is she ?
- This is my daughter

836
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:15,135
In that case she's as good
as my daughter too.

837
01:28:15,232 --> 01:28:18,304
Take me to your father.
- To my father

838
01:28:18,469 --> 01:28:21,848
He died a long time ago.

839
01:28:21,973 --> 01:28:25,079
You love her.
And you keep lying.

840
01:28:25,209 --> 01:28:27,155
Take me to your father.

841
01:28:27,211 --> 01:28:29,521
I want to meet him and
arrange your wedding.

842
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,184
Wedding? Very good.
In that case, he's alive.

843
01:28:33,317 --> 01:28:35,388
Father-in-law, bless me.

844
01:28:35,586 --> 01:28:38,465
Grant that I'll make your
daughter happy.

845
01:28:44,128 --> 01:28:49,237
After being much humbled,
I still dare to come to you.

846
01:28:49,333 --> 01:28:50,971
What rubbish are you talking ?

847
01:28:51,102 --> 01:28:56,518
You need intelligence
to understand me.

848
01:28:57,608 --> 01:28:59,417
What are you looking for ?

849
01:28:59,677 --> 01:29:03,716
Just checking.
Your shoes aren't, are they

850
01:29:04,215 --> 01:29:07,856
Good.
- Why?

851
01:29:10,955 --> 01:29:17,930
If you don't have your shoes
near, you won't throw them.

852
01:29:18,229 --> 01:29:20,470
The gentleman here to see you...

853
01:29:20,631 --> 01:29:23,976
...has a somewhat delicate
constitution.

854
01:29:24,135 --> 01:29:26,547
I hope it isn't a poet
you've grabbed.

855
01:29:26,704 --> 01:29:30,174
I have no taste for grabbing.

856
01:29:30,474 --> 01:29:33,182
I've brought someone,

857
01:29:33,311 --> 01:29:36,315
He isn't a poet.

858
01:29:36,447 --> 01:29:41,260
If he isn't a poet, why would
he be with you ?

859
01:29:42,186 --> 01:29:47,329
Binda, is he here to talk
money with me ?

860
01:29:47,558 --> 01:29:50,402
It has to do with trade.

861
01:29:50,561 --> 01:29:54,839
Nothing small.
this is big time business.

862
01:29:54,965 --> 01:29:56,672
Really, Binda ?

863
01:29:56,801 --> 01:30:00,806
Business for a life time.
A lifetime's business.

864
01:30:00,971 --> 01:30:03,474
Well done, son.

865
01:30:03,574 --> 01:30:08,023
You've finally begun taking
interest in business.

866
01:30:08,145 --> 01:30:09,886
And how!

867
01:30:10,047 --> 01:30:13,517
Even I haven't trapped
such a customer yet.

868
01:30:13,684 --> 01:30:15,027
What did you say?

869
01:30:15,186 --> 01:30:17,223
Do you think you are going
to trap me ?

870
01:30:17,354 --> 01:30:18,958
No, no, nothing of the sort.

871
01:30:19,190 --> 01:30:21,932
Father was talking of
someone in Assam.

872
01:30:25,429 --> 01:30:29,536
Assam? We' re Punjabi.

873
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:35,282
Punjabis are great.
Come in. Sit down.

874
01:30:36,373 --> 01:30:40,014
We consider Punjabis as one of us.
- Really ?

875
01:30:43,748 --> 01:30:46,661
This is my daughter

876
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:47,989
What

877
01:30:50,688 --> 01:30:56,104
He says she is his daughter.

878
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:59,400
Oh, in that case she's my
daughter too.

879
01:30:59,563 --> 01:31:01,509
Ah, that's the response I like.

880
01:31:01,632 --> 01:31:04,511
Come on let me embrace you.
Stand up.

881
01:31:06,704 --> 01:31:09,082
It's fixed then.

882
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:14,046
Shall we negotiate too?

883
01:31:18,783 --> 01:31:26,600
Your methods have left
my bones weak.

884
01:31:27,258 --> 01:31:29,898
We will fix it.

885
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:31,700
But first tell me.

886
01:31:31,829 --> 01:31:33,934
How much interest will you pay?

887
01:31:34,064 --> 01:31:37,443
What kind of customs
do you have ?

888
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:40,072
He wants interest along with
his daughter-in-law.

889
01:31:40,237 --> 01:31:43,480
Are you talking of marriage?

890
01:31:43,574 --> 01:31:45,247
What else ?

891
01:31:45,443 --> 01:31:48,583
Tell me what you want ?
How much dowry do you want?

892
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:50,989
Rs. 20000 ? Rs. 25000?
I'll give it to you.

893
01:31:51,081 --> 01:31:52,617
You'll give that?

894
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,490
Come. Come this way.

895
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:59,464
You too, child.

896
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:03,605
Go on.

897
01:32:04,528 --> 01:32:06,439
What is this?
The door.

898
01:32:06,597 --> 01:32:09,237
You came in this way,
didn't you ?

899
01:32:09,433 --> 01:32:12,505
You can go out the same way.
- What ?

900
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,809
With the girl. Fast.

901
01:32:15,005 --> 01:32:17,144
How dare you ?

902
01:32:17,308 --> 01:32:19,049
If you weren't this
nice boy's father

903
01:32:19,176 --> 01:32:22,248
I'd have made chutney of you.

904
01:32:22,413 --> 01:32:25,451
Come, child.

905
01:32:25,716 --> 01:32:27,423
Thinking of marriage, eh ?

906
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:40,098
Come in, Ghayal.
Why do you knock ?

907
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:48,982
Excuse me. I think you've come
to the wrong home.

908
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:51,279
No, I've come to see you.

909
01:32:51,408 --> 01:32:54,321
I mean, I've been sent.

910
01:32:54,445 --> 01:32:55,583
Who has sent you?

911
01:32:55,713 --> 01:32:58,193
The lady next door ..
the one you always see.

912
01:32:58,349 --> 01:33:00,295
I'm her maid.

913
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:04,024
Your windows haven't been opend
Naseemara is very worried.

914
01:33:04,255 --> 01:33:07,759
She worries all day,
in case you are unwell.

915
01:33:13,064 --> 01:33:15,806
May Allah keep you healthy.

916
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:18,310
May all you troubles come to me.

917
01:33:21,005 --> 01:33:23,849
Listen.

918
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,494
Is Naseem at home?

919
01:33:39,657 --> 01:33:43,127
She's in here.

920
01:33:43,294 --> 01:33:46,366
Where had you gone out
disguised as a servant?

921
01:33:46,564 --> 01:33:48,942
To meet my beloved.

922
01:33:49,133 --> 01:33:51,807
The one at the window?
What's he like ?

923
01:33:51,902 --> 01:33:53,472
Fair or dark ?

924
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:56,116
Fair.

925
01:33:56,273 --> 01:33:59,584
Tall or short?

926
01:34:01,378 --> 01:34:03,483
How does he look?

927
01:34:03,681 --> 01:34:07,356
As if God had made him
with His own hands.

928
01:34:10,054 --> 01:34:12,193
Get lost.

929
01:34:12,356 --> 01:34:16,896
Only my beloved was made
by God with His own hands.

930
01:34:17,294 --> 01:34:21,970
I met him today.

931
01:34:22,099 --> 01:34:24,443
Really?
Tell me quickly.

932
01:34:24,602 --> 01:34:26,604
When did you meet him?
How? Where?

933
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:29,717
You know the young man who
guides me with my poetry?

934
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,013
It turned out to be him!

935
01:34:32,176 --> 01:34:34,315
He's a deep one!

936
01:34:34,578 --> 01:34:36,251
What's he like?

937
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,824
Don't ask.

938
01:34:39,016 --> 01:34:46,491
He's an Adonis,
He dazzles me!

939
01:34:46,657 --> 01:34:50,764
Like a spark in the distance
That I had only dreamed of.

940
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,703
I get the picture.

941
01:34:52,863 --> 01:34:56,902
My beloved has sensitivity.

942
01:34:57,201 --> 01:34:59,044
Maybe.

943
01:34:59,136 --> 01:35:01,480
My beloved has sweetness.

944
01:35:01,605 --> 01:35:03,551
Maybe.

945
01:35:03,607 --> 01:35:06,713
My beloved has love.

946
01:35:07,211 --> 01:35:11,557
His gaze isn't as brilliant
as lightning.

947
01:35:13,117 --> 01:35:14,255
His face doesn't dazzle
like the sun.

948
01:35:15,886 --> 01:35:17,559
But a vision in himself.

949
01:35:25,562 --> 01:35:34,209
"What doesn't my beloved have?"

950
01:35:35,139 --> 01:35:42,819
"He's one in a million!"

951
01:35:54,091 --> 01:36:01,805
"He's handsome and young"

952
01:36:21,251 --> 01:36:26,428
"He's an angel from heaven"

953
01:36:26,623 --> 01:36:30,400
" In human form"

954
01:36:48,312 --> 01:36:52,954
"What doesn't my beloved have?"

955
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:00,396
"Shall I call him a star?
Or a heavenly stream?"

956
01:37:04,228 --> 01:37:09,974
"He has such an effect on me -
I lose my senses"

957
01:37:10,601 --> 01:37:13,104
"As God is my witness!"

958
01:37:13,337 --> 01:37:22,815
"My beloved is as handsome
as can be!"

959
01:37:44,801 --> 01:37:52,015
"My beloved is a young man,
As special as special can be!"

960
01:37:53,544 --> 01:37:57,651
"He has such grace in his gait"

961
01:37:57,814 --> 01:38:02,490
"As swaying branches of
flowers have"

962
01:38:11,161 --> 01:38:15,268
"His voice has a ring to it"

963
01:38:15,566 --> 01:38:20,413
"As only the truest
crystal has"

964
01:38:20,604 --> 01:38:25,075
"His manner wins my heart!"

965
01:38:29,079 --> 01:38:38,295
"What doesn't my beloved have?"

966
01:38:51,768 --> 01:38:55,181
"Your story, my dear,"

967
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:59,887
"ls so much like mine"

968
01:39:00,043 --> 01:39:04,924
"We are two lovers in
similar situations"

969
01:39:08,752 --> 01:39:12,700
"He's one in a million!"

970
01:39:29,673 --> 01:39:34,850
"We've placed our beloveds
on pedestals"

971
01:39:35,145 --> 01:39:39,116
But how do we decide
which is better ?

972
01:39:39,283 --> 01:39:42,696
What's so difficult. I'll
show you my beloved.

973
01:39:42,853 --> 01:39:44,491
You show me yours.

974
01:39:44,654 --> 01:39:47,658
You are right. But ..

975
01:39:47,858 --> 01:39:49,701
...It's a dull answer.

976
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:53,034
But if we lay bets,
it'll be fun.

977
01:39:53,163 --> 01:39:56,337
You're on.
I'll bet anything.

978
01:39:56,467 --> 01:39:59,448
When will you show me
your beloved ?

979
01:39:59,603 --> 01:40:04,177
Not me. Show me yours first.
- Ok. I agree.

980
01:40:04,341 --> 01:40:07,322
All right. I'll be off.

981
01:40:07,777 --> 01:40:12,055
But when can I see him ?

982
01:40:12,316 --> 01:40:13,954
Tomorrow night. At my place.

983
01:40:22,893 --> 01:40:26,067
God protect me from your
dazzling eyes...

984
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,903
Even an angel would have
fallen in love with her.

985
01:40:31,034 --> 01:40:35,414
How can I resist her?

986
01:40:35,806 --> 01:40:36,648
Ve ry p retty .

987
01:40:36,806 --> 01:40:39,184
Listen to me. Don't say a word.

988
01:40:39,342 --> 01:40:40,787
Hold your feelings in check.

989
01:40:40,944 --> 01:40:42,924
But she stuns me.

990
01:40:43,013 --> 01:40:45,960
Naseema, who is this girl?
- My friend.

991
01:40:46,049 --> 01:40:49,758
I can't praise her enough.

992
01:40:49,887 --> 01:40:54,597
I swear I've never seen such
a beautiful girl before.

993
01:40:54,758 --> 01:40:57,796
Careful, Munne Raja,
you'll lose your senses.

994
01:40:57,995 --> 01:40:59,633
I've left my senses
behind already.

995
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:03,301
I'm at your mercy.
Get me married to her somehow.

996
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,743
Else, I'll be in Majnu's
state of despair.

997
01:41:08,438 --> 01:41:12,352
Come down to earth.

998
01:41:12,442 --> 01:41:15,446
She's the nawab Buland
Akhtar's sister.

999
01:41:15,612 --> 01:41:18,752
That' s sad.

1000
01:41:26,623 --> 01:41:29,604
You seem to be lost in thought.

1001
01:41:30,593 --> 01:41:33,631
I must get Husna married quickly.

1002
01:41:35,098 --> 01:41:37,078
She's grown up now.

1003
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:39,170
Are there any proposals ?

1004
01:41:41,205 --> 01:41:43,583
The families that
have shown interest...

1005
01:41:43,707 --> 01:41:51,216
only have money but no culture,
no education, no character.

1006
01:41:56,053 --> 01:41:58,090
Set them aside.

1007
01:41:58,321 --> 01:42:00,631
Find a young man likely to succeed.

1008
01:42:02,025 --> 01:42:04,005
I have a boy in mind.

1009
01:42:04,761 --> 01:42:07,037
He's handsome, educated,

1010
01:42:07,297 --> 01:42:10,073
I know nothing of his family.

1011
01:42:10,266 --> 01:42:12,940
But his face shows character

1012
01:42:13,036 --> 01:42:15,243
And good breeding too.

1013
01:42:15,372 --> 01:42:18,251
The thing is, he's poor.
He's only just got a job.

1014
01:42:20,977 --> 01:42:23,457
So what if he's poor?

1015
01:42:23,647 --> 01:42:26,753
He has the wealth of
education with him.

1016
01:42:26,983 --> 01:42:30,089
Let him share Husna's destiny.

1017
01:42:30,254 --> 01:42:34,566
He's bound to make something
of himself.

1018
01:42:35,091 --> 01:42:39,301
I'm glad I talked to you.
I feel better now.

1019
01:42:40,730 --> 01:42:43,506
I've brought you here to meet him.

1020
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,876
But how can I do it ?

1021
01:42:46,036 --> 01:42:48,380
When I see him, I go to pieces.

1022
01:42:48,505 --> 01:42:51,952
My heart will pound and
I'll forget to speak.

1023
01:42:52,275 --> 01:42:56,087
If you don't believe me,
check my pulse.

1024
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:59,090
It's fairly leaping.

1025
01:42:59,349 --> 01:43:02,956
Let me see.

1026
01:43:04,454 --> 01:43:10,200
Oh yes, It's running like a
freight train.

1027
01:43:10,461 --> 01:43:14,910
Here I am dying of nerves.
And you're cracking jokes.

1028
01:43:15,165 --> 01:43:18,908
All right.
You go and hide.

1029
01:43:19,002 --> 01:43:21,482
I'll meet him.

1030
01:43:21,638 --> 01:43:24,346
Let's see how much I like him.
Enough to flirt a bit?

1031
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:26,851
He's here.

1032
01:43:26,977 --> 01:43:28,786
Where are you running off?

1033
01:43:28,979 --> 01:43:31,619
Aren't you going to stay and flirt?
Get lost.

1034
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:27,314
My coy maiden, raise your
eyes to me.

1035
01:44:28,004 --> 01:44:34,353
I yearn to see my love's
reflection in your eyes.

1036
01:44:38,214 --> 01:44:42,185
Husna, look at me.

1037
01:44:44,087 --> 01:44:50,971
This lucky moment comes after
years of misfortune.

1038
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:01,205
As soon as our eyes meet,
I lose my senses.

1039
01:45:01,905 --> 01:45:06,581
If this is how it is now,
I wonder how it'll end.

1040
01:45:08,979 --> 01:45:10,981
Why are you so quiet?

1041
01:45:11,114 --> 01:45:13,116
You asked me to come.
Talk to me.

1042
01:45:13,249 --> 01:45:16,890
I didn't call you.
- You didn't?

1043
01:45:17,087 --> 01:45:21,297
But not for myself.
For my friend.

1044
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:25,299
We had a bet.

1045
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:27,338
She said her beloved was better.

1046
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:31,776
I said mine was.
Husna ?

1047
01:45:32,235 --> 01:45:34,476
My friend is watching.

1048
01:45:34,704 --> 01:45:37,378
She's hiding over there.

1049
01:45:41,211 --> 01:45:43,885
Do come here.

1050
01:45:44,014 --> 01:45:47,427
Come and have a look at me.

1051
01:45:47,617 --> 01:45:51,087
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

1052
01:45:51,421 --> 01:45:54,595
Your beloved must be
infinitely better than me.

1053
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:00,670
Are you afraid that
I might see you ?

1054
01:46:00,897 --> 01:46:03,935
Don't be afraid.
I'll close my eyes.

1055
01:46:04,134 --> 01:46:07,411
You can come and compare me
with your beloved.

1056
01:46:08,304 --> 01:46:11,342
Look, I've closed my eyes.

1057
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:28,897
Well, what do you think of me ?

1058
01:46:29,025 --> 01:46:31,505
What can I say ?

1059
01:46:31,661 --> 01:46:34,471
Better than anyone else in
the world.

1060
01:46:34,697 --> 01:46:38,736
You're only consoling me.
- No, I speak the truth.

1061
01:46:39,236 --> 01:46:40,977
In comparison with you...

1062
01:46:41,137 --> 01:46:45,415
my beloved is only a
fraction of your reality.

1063
01:46:45,642 --> 01:46:47,349
Don't mock me.

1064
01:46:47,477 --> 01:46:49,286
I've seen myself in the mirror.

1065
01:46:49,379 --> 01:46:53,850
You may have.
But not through my eyes.

1066
01:46:56,619 --> 01:46:58,326
You -_>

1067
01:46:59,856 --> 01:47:02,359
Why are you surprised to see
my friend ?

1068
01:47:02,559 --> 01:47:04,300
That's what I was wondering about.

1069
01:47:04,427 --> 01:47:07,033
Tell me, Anwar, where
were you lost?

1070
01:47:07,197 --> 01:47:10,906
I just thought...

1071
01:47:11,034 --> 01:47:12,707
That you'd seen me before?

1072
01:47:12,802 --> 01:47:17,308
The thing is, he's stunned
by your beauty.

1073
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:20,477
You' re right, Husna.

1074
01:47:20,677 --> 01:47:23,988
God preserve your beauty.

1075
01:47:24,314 --> 01:47:27,090
Your friend is truly beautiful.

1076
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:29,161
Thank you for the compliment.

1077
01:47:29,686 --> 01:47:33,133
All right, Husna.
I accept defeat.

1078
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:37,566
Good bye.
- Good bye.

1079
01:48:29,813 --> 01:48:32,020
Ma'am, Anwar is here.

1080
01:48:32,582 --> 01:48:33,925
Who?

1081
01:48:34,117 --> 01:48:36,393
The man at the window.

1082
01:48:36,619 --> 01:48:38,963
Tell him I'm not at home.

1083
01:48:39,155 --> 01:48:43,501
Allow me to say something.
I won't forget this favour.

1084
01:48:43,827 --> 01:48:46,535
Neither will I.

1085
01:48:46,863 --> 01:48:50,242
What is it?

1086
01:48:59,242 --> 01:49:04,555
If I have hurt your feelings
I am truly sorry.

1087
01:49:06,382 --> 01:49:08,328
God is my witness.

1088
01:49:08,651 --> 01:49:11,689
Whatever happened was accidental.

1089
01:49:11,921 --> 01:49:14,299
I hadn't met Husna.

1090
01:49:14,524 --> 01:49:17,562
I heard my song being sung.

1091
01:49:17,761 --> 01:49:20,742
I saw you.
I thought you were Husna.

1092
01:49:20,897 --> 01:49:23,537
I bear no grudge.

1093
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:27,976
If I have any complaint
..it is against my fate.

1094
01:49:28,171 --> 01:49:31,618
It has played a trick on me.

1095
01:49:32,875 --> 01:49:36,823
Anwar, I have a request.

1096
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:43,829
Don't tell Husna my
ill-fated story.

1097
01:49:44,587 --> 01:49:46,396
Good bye.

1098
01:49:58,335 --> 01:50:02,806
I am the Begum of
Raunaq Mahal.

1099
01:50:03,105 --> 01:50:05,551
Naseemara is my brother's daughter.

1100
01:50:05,775 --> 01:50:08,415
I've brought her up
as my own child.

1101
01:50:08,678 --> 01:50:11,921
I've given her every joy.
At any price.

1102
01:50:12,615 --> 01:50:14,219
I don't understand.

1103
01:50:14,417 --> 01:50:18,388
Today I want to buy her your love.

1104
01:50:18,822 --> 01:50:21,268
Name your price.

1105
01:50:21,457 --> 01:50:24,802
Begum, love is worship.

1106
01:50:24,927 --> 01:50:28,306
Love is felt, not sold.

1107
01:50:28,531 --> 01:50:29,805
I understand...

1108
01:50:30,066 --> 01:50:33,513
You are leaving Naseemara for Husna...

1109
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:37,916
you think that Nawab Akhtar has more
wealth than we do...

1110
01:50:38,274 --> 01:50:43,274
all of it is show! He is completly in debt!
- I request your abscence.

1111
01:51:07,670 --> 01:51:11,015
Husna's beauty is being discussed
in every house in Lucknow.

1112
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:15,048
Everyone hopes to win
her as a bride.

1113
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,027
Let's see where Husna's
fate takes her.

1114
01:51:20,416 --> 01:51:25,593
If God wills it, she'll
marry into a prosperous family.

1115
01:51:26,389 --> 01:51:29,598
I see no suitable family
in Lucknow.

1116
01:51:29,825 --> 01:51:32,738
Why not? I've been
thinking of her.

1117
01:51:32,829 --> 01:51:34,866
I've found you a very
good proposal.

1118
01:51:35,064 --> 01:51:37,237
Nawab Munne Raja of
Lal Haveli.

1119
01:51:37,466 --> 01:51:40,072
I don't like this
proposal at all.

1120
01:51:40,336 --> 01:51:44,307
Husna may be known for
her beauty.

1121
01:51:44,474 --> 01:51:48,889
But Munne Raja is known for
his bad character.

1122
01:51:49,112 --> 01:51:50,819
Don't be childish.

1123
01:51:51,014 --> 01:51:54,518
He's a rich man.
He lives that life.

1124
01:51:54,984 --> 01:51:57,055
He has a penchant for music
and nautch girls.

1125
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,166
This adds to his reputation.
It doesn't detract from it.

1126
01:51:59,288 --> 01:52:00,961
Milk fairly flows in the
Lal Haveli.

1127
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:03,161
If you don't believe it,
go and check it out.

1128
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:05,896
Gold and silver abounds there.

1129
01:52:06,062 --> 01:52:10,875
Gold, silver, marble.

1130
01:52:11,167 --> 01:52:14,273
I don't want a mausoleum
for my sister.

1131
01:52:14,437 --> 01:52:17,077
I'll get her married to a man

1132
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:20,744
...who has love and character
to offer her.

1133
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:23,522
Do what you will.

1134
01:52:23,713 --> 01:52:26,319
I brought a suggestion.

1135
01:52:26,483 --> 01:52:28,156
Husna could be a queen.

1136
01:52:28,317 --> 01:52:30,923
And Munne Raja would take
care of all your debts.

1137
01:52:34,190 --> 01:52:38,502
Don't forget. You're in
debt up to your ears.

1138
01:52:38,628 --> 01:52:42,576
If you lose the mansion,
your reputation will be lost.

1139
01:52:56,545 --> 01:53:00,288
Brother, if you'd only
listened to me.

1140
01:53:01,384 --> 01:53:05,389
You strayed. And
mortgaged the property.

1141
01:53:05,588 --> 01:53:09,195
Now the family's reputation
is at stake.

1142
01:53:09,626 --> 01:53:12,539
Your death became your escape.

1143
01:53:12,762 --> 01:53:17,871
How long can I hold up
these crumbling walls?

1144
01:53:20,403 --> 01:53:22,815
Someone to meet you.

1145
01:53:23,139 --> 01:53:26,814
May I come in, Nawab?

1146
01:53:31,381 --> 01:53:33,884
Excuse me.
I don't recognise you.

1147
01:53:34,049 --> 01:53:38,259
I dare say. How could you?

1148
01:53:38,421 --> 01:53:44,633
When I went on the ha],
you were this small.

1149
01:53:52,268 --> 01:54:00,312
Son, Lucknow was glorious
when your father was alive.

1150
01:54:00,477 --> 01:54:04,892
Lucknow has lost its dazzle now.

1151
01:54:05,048 --> 01:54:08,291
He was my childhood friend.

1152
01:54:08,518 --> 01:54:11,590
What are those days those were!

1153
01:54:11,754 --> 01:54:14,530
What nights!

1154
01:54:14,657 --> 01:54:19,197
What conversation!
What meetings! What follies!

1155
01:54:29,772 --> 01:54:32,878
I suffer from the cough.

1156
01:54:33,042 --> 01:54:36,683
It's particularly bad today.

1157
01:54:36,879 --> 01:54:41,453
Yes. weather's bad.
What can I do for you?

1158
01:54:41,617 --> 01:54:47,624
I'm here to serve this family.
For the last time.

1159
01:54:47,923 --> 01:54:50,836
I'm a professional matchmaker.

1160
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:55,839
I had arranged your father's
wedding too.

1161
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:02,877
I have come to arrange
your sister's marriage.

1162
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:07,278
I've brought Husna up
with great love.

1163
01:55:07,443 --> 01:55:09,980
I'd like her to marry someone...

1164
01:55:10,145 --> 01:55:13,888
...with looks, character,
breeding and education.

1165
01:55:14,083 --> 01:55:15,721
Money is immaterial.

1166
01:55:15,885 --> 01:55:19,389
I agree. You're right.

1167
01:55:19,588 --> 01:55:21,932
Money comes and goes.

1168
01:55:22,124 --> 01:55:24,263
Absolutely. But whose proposal
have you brought?

1169
01:55:24,393 --> 01:55:27,101
The boy's name is Mirza
Anwar Hussain.

1170
01:55:28,564 --> 01:55:32,410
He's a great poet.
His pen name is Anwar.

1171
01:55:32,535 --> 01:55:36,210
He's a good friend.
I know him well.

1172
01:55:36,339 --> 01:55:38,319
Then what do you say?

1173
01:55:38,507 --> 01:55:43,378
If he's your friend, you
shouldn't hesitate.

1174
01:55:43,379 --> 01:55:46,189
You took the words
out of my mouth.

1175
01:55:46,448 --> 01:55:47,950
I've been thinking of
this for some time.

1176
01:55:48,084 --> 01:55:50,690
Is it certain then?
- Absolutely.

1177
01:55:50,886 --> 01:55:52,991
Anwar and Husna's marriage
is fixed.

1178
01:55:53,189 --> 01:55:57,069
Congratulations!
Bless the couple.

1179
01:55:57,226 --> 01:55:59,672
I take your leave.

1180
01:56:03,132 --> 01:56:05,043
Mr. Ghayal?
- Yes?

1181
01:56:05,267 --> 01:56:06,803
Your stick.

1182
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:08,447
Excuse me.

1183
01:56:14,911 --> 01:56:17,585
Nawab, you recognised me, did you?

1184
01:56:17,780 --> 01:56:21,091
You're an old friend
of my father's.

1185
01:56:21,483 --> 01:56:25,056
Nawab, sir.
I beg your pardon.

1186
01:56:25,254 --> 01:56:30,533
The thing is, Anwar has
no one except me.

1187
01:56:30,693 --> 01:56:34,470
I was afraid to broach
the subject of marriage.

1188
01:56:34,730 --> 01:56:37,210
How could I?

1189
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:41,041
I put on the beard for a
touch of dignity.

1190
01:56:41,203 --> 01:56:42,705
I made a mistake.

1191
01:56:42,872 --> 01:56:44,977
Not at all, Ghayal.

1192
01:56:45,174 --> 01:56:48,212
Embrace me in the joy
of your friend's wedding.

1193
01:56:52,415 --> 01:56:54,861
You're great.

1194
01:56:59,054 --> 01:57:02,092
I'll have a sweetmeat.

1195
01:57:15,538 --> 01:57:18,246
I've arranged your wedding
with Anwar.

1196
01:57:20,109 --> 01:57:23,147
You'll leave me in only
a few days now.

1197
01:57:32,255 --> 01:57:37,728
A daughter is but a guest
in her father's house.

1198
01:57:38,861 --> 01:57:43,401
Parents do all they can
for a child.

1199
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:48,708
When the responsibility
came to me, I did my best.

1200
01:57:50,005 --> 01:57:54,010
I am but a man.
I can make mistakes.

1201
01:57:54,276 --> 01:58:00,488
Forgive me for any shortcomings.

1202
01:58:12,194 --> 01:58:14,037
Gone mad, Ghayal?

1203
01:58:14,363 --> 01:58:18,209
I too saw the sun rise in the west.

1204
01:58:18,367 --> 01:58:21,177
Rain rising from the earth.

1205
01:58:21,337 --> 01:58:24,011
And a harvest in the sky.

1206
01:58:24,206 --> 01:58:26,345
Good. This lover has
lost his senses.

1207
01:58:26,475 --> 01:58:28,955
I'll tear your shirt and
throw you out.

1208
01:58:29,112 --> 01:58:31,558
Urchins will throw stones
at you. Dogs will bark.

1209
01:58:31,681 --> 01:58:35,595
When I'm stoned, d'you know
what your beloved will say?

1210
01:58:35,785 --> 01:58:41,326
"Don't throw stones at my
brother-in-law"

1211
01:58:41,757 --> 01:58:43,759
Have you brought a message
from Husna?

1212
01:58:43,926 --> 01:58:46,372
First offer me a sweetmeat.

1213
01:58:46,662 --> 01:58:48,266
We don't even have sugar
in the house.

1214
01:58:48,497 --> 01:58:51,478
OK. How about a sweet kiss?

1215
01:58:54,403 --> 01:58:56,212
This one's sour.

1216
01:58:56,405 --> 01:58:58,407
Then take the sweet one.

1217
01:58:59,775 --> 01:59:01,083
Now tell me.

1218
01:59:01,243 --> 01:59:02,449
Come here.

1219
01:59:02,645 --> 01:59:04,682
Tell me.

1220
01:59:05,381 --> 01:59:08,760
I've been walking. I'm tired.
Press my feet.

1221
01:59:09,585 --> 01:59:11,258
All right.

1222
01:59:11,487 --> 01:59:14,058
Praising you has given me a
headache too. Massage my head.

1223
01:59:18,594 --> 01:59:19,732
Here.

1224
01:59:19,896 --> 01:59:22,376
Ghayal, your throat must be
aching after all that talk.

1225
01:59:22,798 --> 01:59:24,675
Speak up!

1226
01:59:24,767 --> 01:59:26,747
All right. I will.

1227
01:59:26,969 --> 01:59:29,006
I've arranged your marriage
with Husna.

1228
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:30,843
Fixed my marriage?

1229
01:59:31,007 --> 01:59:32,247
But how did the Nawab agree?

1230
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:35,217
I praised you to the skies.

1231
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:37,254
The Nawab was carried away.

1232
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:42,725
He asked me to fix Husna's
marriage with you.

1233
01:59:42,852 --> 01:59:44,627
I was obstinate.

1234
01:59:44,753 --> 01:59:47,632
He went down on his knees.

1235
01:59:47,823 --> 01:59:50,429
Then I melted.
The wedding was arranged.

1236
01:59:52,829 --> 01:59:56,402
He gave me one but took two.

1237
01:59:59,602 --> 02:00:04,210
Aunt, the Nawab called my
mansion a mausoleum, did he?

1238
02:00:04,406 --> 02:00:07,353
I'll take revenge on him,
brick by brick.

1239
02:00:07,543 --> 02:00:10,524
I'll turn his estate
into a graveyard.

1240
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:22,335
Go and buy the Nawab's
debts at any price.

1241
02:00:22,658 --> 02:00:24,535
Very well, sir.

1242
02:00:24,794 --> 02:00:28,401
I'll demean him in the eyes
of Lucknow society.

1243
02:00:49,919 --> 02:00:52,092
Anwar, how do you come
to be here?

1244
02:00:52,254 --> 02:00:54,894
Are you here to meet me?
- I came to meet a friend nearby.

1245
02:00:57,993 --> 02:01:01,372
What's he called?

1246
02:01:01,797 --> 02:01:04,038
Mr. Kewal Kashyap.

1247
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,209
Does he stay near here?

1248
02:01:06,401 --> 02:01:09,575
Excuse me. I'm in a hurry.

1249
02:01:09,705 --> 02:01:11,776
I'll take your leave.

1250
02:01:15,645 --> 02:01:19,115
Najma, what do you think
of this boy?

1251
02:01:19,381 --> 02:01:23,329
He's a boy of character
who'll go far.

1252
02:01:23,485 --> 02:01:26,864
This is the boy I've chosen
for Husna.

1253
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:35,908
I don't think Anwar is
suitable for Husna.

1254
02:01:36,098 --> 02:01:37,509
Do you know Anwar?

1255
02:01:37,666 --> 02:01:40,579
Yes. He's a good poet.

1256
02:01:40,736 --> 02:01:44,775
I've seen his work in
the papers. His photos too.

1257
02:01:44,974 --> 02:01:49,218
You've pampered Husna so much.

1258
02:01:49,445 --> 02:01:53,222
How will she get that
comfort in a poet's house?

1259
02:01:54,049 --> 02:01:57,053
Poets are poor.

1260
02:01:57,353 --> 02:02:01,358
I'm amazed. Till yesterday
you praised the poor.

1261
02:02:01,523 --> 02:02:04,060
Today you scorn them.

1262
02:02:04,226 --> 02:02:07,435
I've given my word.

1263
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:10,702
In that case,
congratulations.

1264
02:02:11,066 --> 02:02:16,482
May they be happy.

1265
02:02:17,006 --> 02:02:18,610
So be it.

1266
02:02:18,908 --> 02:02:20,945
I'll go now.

1267
02:02:21,677 --> 02:02:23,816
Bless you.

1268
02:02:52,474 --> 02:02:53,782
Sister.

1269
02:02:53,976 --> 02:02:57,981
I know what you're here for.

1270
02:02:59,815 --> 02:03:04,855
Don't doubt the Nawab.

1271
02:03:06,388 --> 02:03:08,891
He's innocent.

1272
02:03:09,057 --> 02:03:14,473
I swear our love is pure.

1273
02:03:14,763 --> 02:03:16,970
Selfless.

1274
02:03:17,166 --> 02:03:21,546
I'm obliged to him.

1275
02:03:21,803 --> 02:03:30,348
If it weren't for him, I'd
have lost my reputation.

1276
02:03:30,546 --> 02:03:34,460
I'd have been on the streets.

1277
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:39,196
He isn't a man but an angel.

1278
02:03:40,689 --> 02:03:47,664
He deserves the
greatest respect.

1279
02:03:50,933 --> 02:03:55,279
I misjudged the Nawab.

1280
02:03:56,605 --> 02:03:58,915
I'm ashamed.

1281
02:04:01,009 --> 02:04:04,422
Forgive me.

1282
02:04:04,747 --> 02:04:07,785
The Nawab gave you respect.

1283
02:04:08,016 --> 02:04:11,623
And looked after you.

1284
02:04:13,555 --> 02:04:16,866
I bow to him.

1285
02:04:17,126 --> 02:04:18,730
Bless you.

1286
02:04:19,161 --> 02:04:21,573
May God protect you.

1287
02:04:24,233 --> 02:04:31,378
The Nawab said he was getting
his sister married to you.

1288
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:35,511
Yes. That's what I came
to tell you.

1289
02:04:43,485 --> 02:04:50,198
Can't you find an excuse
and refuse?

1290
02:04:50,359 --> 02:04:53,431
But why?

1291
02:04:53,862 --> 02:04:58,709
Husna isn't like you.
She's rich.

1292
02:04:59,034 --> 02:05:01,913
If she doesn't get the
comfort she's used to...

1293
02:05:02,404 --> 02:05:06,614
...you' ll be uneasy.

1294
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:15,421
With your blessings, I'll
give Husna every happiness.

1295
02:05:16,152 --> 02:05:19,292
Make preparations.

1296
02:05:19,521 --> 02:05:22,661
The groom's party will leave
from your house.

1297
02:05:22,891 --> 02:05:25,895
If you don't join in the
celebrations...

1298
02:05:26,094 --> 02:05:29,166
...I'll never forgive you.

1299
02:05:29,365 --> 02:05:31,470
Don't worry.

1300
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:36,342
After your engagement,
you'll come as a groom.

1301
02:05:36,772 --> 02:05:43,986
I'll be very haPPV-

1302
02:05:45,181 --> 02:05:50,597
Do something for me.

1303
02:05:52,354 --> 02:05:56,461
I want to acknowledge you
as my sister publicly.

1304
02:05:56,625 --> 02:05:59,105
Be brave.

1305
02:05:59,261 --> 02:06:02,606
You will have to join many
celebrations...

1306
02:06:02,764 --> 02:06:05,244
...without your unlucky sister.

1307
02:06:07,403 --> 02:06:13,285
This plant that I have
planted ..will bear flowers.

1308
02:06:13,475 --> 02:06:18,254
And bear fruit.

1309
02:06:18,714 --> 02:06:23,561
I thank God.

1310
02:06:32,327 --> 02:06:34,773
Ghayal, I request you
to tie this.

1311
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:37,171
Nawab, you are my friend
and an elder.

1312
02:06:37,365 --> 02:06:40,369
I would like you to tie it.

1313
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:58,863
Congratulations.

1314
02:07:48,604 --> 02:07:53,815
"My dear, spare me a glance"

1315
02:07:54,009 --> 02:07:57,286
"Cast your eyes this way"

1316
02:08:26,041 --> 02:08:31,047
"This is a day of happiness"

1317
02:08:31,246 --> 02:08:35,592
"May the first moonbeam
kiss your feet"

1318
02:08:47,429 --> 02:08:50,000
"Even if you don't think
of me as your own..."

1319
02:08:50,132 --> 02:08:52,305
"Raise your eyes"

1320
02:08:52,467 --> 02:08:57,467
"Look upon me as you will.
Cast your eyes this way"

1321
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:26,570
"Whatever your preference is,
I am happy to accept it"

1322
02:09:26,835 --> 02:09:30,749
"I wish you every happiness"

1323
02:09:35,877 --> 02:09:40,877
"And many days of love.
Another may be consumed"

1324
02:10:15,317 --> 02:10:17,388
"Let happiness be yours!
I swear upon this lovely face"

1325
02:10:17,586 --> 02:10:20,032
"My feet are unsteady"

1326
02:10:20,222 --> 02:10:23,931
"It occurs to me
to steal your joy"

1327
02:10:26,962 --> 02:10:31,570
"With your inimitable grace,
accept my gift"

1328
02:10:31,767 --> 02:10:40,050
"Look into my heart and see
what I have given up for you"

1329
02:11:20,181 --> 02:11:22,593
Bless you.

1330
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:27,862
You look like a prince.

1331
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:33,332
You must have dazzled everyone.

1332
02:11:34,096 --> 02:11:37,305
They must have talked
to each other.

1333
02:11:37,499 --> 02:11:42,346
They'd never seen a more
handsome groom.

1334
02:12:09,164 --> 02:12:12,873
It's very late.
Sleep here tonight.

1335
02:12:13,769 --> 02:12:16,045
All right.

1336
02:13:16,230 --> 02:13:19,302
Anyone at home?

1337
02:13:21,569 --> 02:13:23,879
Husna!

1338
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:33,220
What happened?

1339
02:13:33,381 --> 02:13:36,385
Call a doctor.
I'm not feeling well.

1340
02:13:48,029 --> 02:13:52,478
I don't know what's wrong
with my brother. Come quickly.

1341
02:14:14,789 --> 02:14:18,032
Your blood pressure is normal.

1342
02:14:18,326 --> 02:14:21,364
Forget about heart attacks.

1343
02:14:21,563 --> 02:14:25,204
Why did he suffer so much
last night?

1344
02:14:25,367 --> 02:14:27,506
I told you last night.

1345
02:14:27,669 --> 02:14:31,515
The reason is some
mental anguish.

1346
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:33,242
Nothing of the sort.

1347
02:14:33,408 --> 02:14:35,410
In that case, you're
absolutely well.

1348
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:38,514
There are no restrictions.

1349
02:14:38,713 --> 02:14:40,784
You can sit up.

1350
02:14:40,915 --> 02:14:44,055
You can walk around.
You can eat anything you like.

1351
02:14:44,252 --> 02:14:48,132
But cut down on this.

1352
02:14:58,366 --> 02:15:01,142
Anwar wants to meet you.

1353
02:15:03,504 --> 02:15:05,211
Shall I call him in here?

1354
02:15:05,373 --> 02:15:07,182
Didn't you hear what
the doctor said?

1355
02:15:07,275 --> 02:15:09,414
I'm absolutely well.

1356
02:15:21,122 --> 02:15:23,227
Good day.

1357
02:15:23,658 --> 02:15:25,729
Sit down, Anwar.

1358
02:15:27,929 --> 02:15:29,806
How are you?

1359
02:15:29,931 --> 02:15:32,434
I was worried by your
sudden illness.

1360
02:15:33,201 --> 02:15:34,544
That's natural.

1361
02:15:34,702 --> 02:15:42,211
You're my friend.
And relation too.

1362
02:15:43,445 --> 02:15:47,325
You must be surprised
to see me alive.

1363
02:15:47,782 --> 02:15:53,562
With such a severe blow
I'm still alive.

1364
02:15:53,822 --> 02:15:57,929
May your enemies die.

1365
02:15:58,059 --> 02:15:59,834
May you live long.

1366
02:16:00,028 --> 02:16:04,443
Anwar, why award me
a poison-filled life?

1367
02:16:04,632 --> 02:16:08,273
I'd prefer the peace of life.

1368
02:16:08,503 --> 02:16:11,279
My heart isn't totally
broken yet.

1369
02:16:11,539 --> 02:16:15,578
I still seek the support
of my friends.

1370
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:17,451
Excuse me.

1371
02:16:17,612 --> 02:16:20,650
You can hug and kiss Husna.

1372
02:16:21,449 --> 02:16:24,794
Najma can hug me too.

1373
02:16:24,953 --> 02:16:28,958
Anwar, Husna is my sister.
She is like my daughter.

1374
02:16:29,124 --> 02:16:31,434
Najma is my sister.
And a mother to me.

1375
02:16:31,593 --> 02:16:33,197
You're lying.
No, it's the truth.

1376
02:16:33,661 --> 02:16:35,299
Yes, Nawab.

1377
02:16:35,463 --> 02:16:36,999
Naima, you?

1378
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,076
Anwar is my brother.

1379
02:16:41,469 --> 02:16:44,643
Why didn't you tell me this...

1380
02:16:44,839 --> 02:16:47,479
...the day I introduced
him to you?

1381
02:16:48,643 --> 02:16:52,523
I told you clearly that he
was the groom I'd chosen.

1382
02:16:53,114 --> 02:16:57,585
As God is my witness,
I tried to dissuade you.

1383
02:16:57,786 --> 02:17:00,062
Later, I tried to persuade
Anwar to refuse.

1384
02:17:02,424 --> 02:17:07,169
But when I found out
they were in love...

1385
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:12,734
I don't want to hear
any more.

1386
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:17,076
All I know is this:
I saved you from ruin.

1387
02:17:17,205 --> 02:17:19,412
I gave you protection.

1388
02:17:19,608 --> 02:17:22,782
I gave you a chaste love.
I protected your honour.

1389
02:17:22,911 --> 02:17:26,757
But in return you deceived me.

1390
02:17:26,948 --> 02:17:29,588
You deliberately
hid it from me...

1391
02:17:29,684 --> 02:17:31,891
...that Anwar is your brother.

1392
02:17:31,987 --> 02:17:36,493
You thought that once
Anwar enters this family...

1393
02:17:36,691 --> 02:17:39,831
...l would have to
accept you as my wife.

1394
02:17:39,961 --> 02:17:45,001
I swear I never thought that.

1395
02:17:45,166 --> 02:17:51,344
My life has blossomed
in your shadow.

1396
02:17:51,706 --> 02:17:55,415
Take your accusation back.

1397
02:17:55,643 --> 02:18:00,285
I would rather die in
your shadow.

1398
02:18:00,481 --> 02:18:03,587
Take Anwar to your heart.

1399
02:18:03,751 --> 02:18:08,063
Let this be your last
favour to me.

1400
02:18:08,223 --> 02:18:12,603
I swear I'll never darken
your door again.

1401
02:18:12,727 --> 02:18:15,264
Nor Anwar's.

1402
02:18:15,396 --> 02:18:16,500
My sister!

1403
02:18:16,631 --> 02:18:18,838
Quiet, Anwar.

1404
02:18:19,034 --> 02:18:25,349
Nawab, for God's sake, don't
take Anwar's love from him.

1405
02:18:25,573 --> 02:18:27,416
I bow before you.

1406
02:18:30,144 --> 02:18:34,718
I honour you.

1407
02:18:34,916 --> 02:18:37,726
I won't let you bow
before anyone.

1408
02:18:37,985 --> 02:18:44,163
I don't want that love.
If you have to beg for it.

1409
02:18:48,329 --> 02:18:51,970
We too are children of
a noble family.

1410
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:55,913
Time destroyed our
family's glory.

1411
02:18:56,404 --> 02:18:59,283
But the blood that flows
in our veins...

1412
02:18:59,541 --> 02:19:02,579
is no less noble than yours.

1413
02:19:10,351 --> 02:19:12,729
Anwar, it would be best
for you to leave.

1414
02:19:12,887 --> 02:19:16,960
Before I leave, allow me
to thank you.

1415
02:19:17,158 --> 02:19:19,729
This brother and sister's
relationship...

1416
02:19:19,861 --> 02:19:22,341
...which had been drowned
in darkness...

1417
02:19:22,497 --> 02:19:25,774
...will see the light
of day now.

1418
02:19:25,934 --> 02:19:29,108
I won't forget this.

1419
02:19:29,304 --> 02:19:32,649
I can now proudly and
publicly state this.

1420
02:19:32,841 --> 02:19:37,654
Najma is my sister.
She's my mother.

1421
02:19:37,845 --> 02:19:43,124
Today I'm the luckiest
man on earth.

1422
02:19:43,417 --> 02:19:45,727
I feel I'm touching the sky.

1423
02:19:46,154 --> 02:19:48,156
Let's go.

1424
02:20:13,381 --> 02:20:17,227
Rumours have spread
all over Lucknow.

1425
02:20:17,351 --> 02:20:22,027
After getting engaged,
Anwar refused to marry Husna.

1426
02:20:22,156 --> 02:20:25,194
Whatever they may say,
I feel for you.

1427
02:20:25,326 --> 02:20:30,275
How dare they say anything
about Husna or this family!

1428
02:20:30,531 --> 02:20:35,708
No one dare say that.

1429
02:20:37,271 --> 02:20:40,582
We know why we broke
the engagement.

1430
02:20:40,775 --> 02:20:44,780
We don't want any interference
in our family matters.

1431
02:20:44,946 --> 02:20:46,857
Tell me why you are here.

1432
02:20:47,014 --> 02:20:48,891
You mistake me.

1433
02:20:49,016 --> 02:20:53,294
I come at this delicate
time to help you.

1434
02:20:53,421 --> 02:20:58,871
I wish you wouldn't think of
my Lal Haveli as a mausoleum.

1435
02:20:59,026 --> 02:21:00,562
But as Husna's home.

1436
02:21:00,695 --> 02:21:03,801
I told your aunt very clearly.

1437
02:21:03,964 --> 02:21:06,171
I don't care for this proposal.

1438
02:21:06,367 --> 02:21:12,977
Now your family honour
is in my hands.

1439
02:21:13,174 --> 02:21:19,022
I have purchased all your
debts -at double the price.

1440
02:21:19,213 --> 02:21:22,683
Paying off your debts
...is beyond your power now.

1441
02:21:22,783 --> 02:21:26,560
But it's very easy for me
to auction this place.

1442
02:21:26,754 --> 02:21:29,826
This house isn't sold yet.

1443
02:21:29,990 --> 02:21:31,867
It still belongs to me.

1444
02:21:32,026 --> 02:21:36,168
It is my kindness that
allows you to stand here.

1445
02:21:36,297 --> 02:21:38,937
You are my senior.

1446
02:21:39,033 --> 02:21:41,570
I give you one more chance
to think it over.

1447
02:21:41,736 --> 02:21:44,307
If this mansion is sold,
your glory ends.

1448
02:21:44,471 --> 02:21:47,611
You'll find it difficult
to get Husna married.

1449
02:21:48,409 --> 02:21:51,185
Whether our glory
lives or dies...

1450
02:21:51,311 --> 02:21:55,782
even if this mansion is sold
...and we move into a hovel.

1451
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:59,397
I may lose my title.

1452
02:21:59,553 --> 02:22:05,401
But my sister will never
marry a degenerate like you.

1453
02:22:06,293 --> 02:22:07,363
Anyone here?

1454
02:22:07,495 --> 02:22:09,338
Throw this man out.

1455
02:23:36,817 --> 02:23:39,263
I see darkness everywhere.

1456
02:23:40,955 --> 02:23:42,957
I don't know what to do.

1457
02:23:44,491 --> 02:23:46,368
Believe me.

1458
02:23:46,527 --> 02:23:49,701
I won't be able to live even
a moment... without you.

1459
02:23:56,537 --> 02:24:01,646
Husna, family honour is more
important than love.

1460
02:24:05,212 --> 02:24:07,385
Tell me.

1461
02:24:08,415 --> 02:24:10,622
If you were in your
brother's place -

1462
02:24:11,051 --> 02:24:16,433
If you had made sacrifices
to bring up your sister -

1463
02:24:16,657 --> 02:24:19,160
Would you have got her
married to me?

1464
02:24:20,961 --> 02:24:22,497
Answer me, Husna.

1465
02:24:24,298 --> 02:24:28,906
I swear I never blamed
my brother for this.

1466
02:24:29,036 --> 02:24:32,950
I know he's right.

1467
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:39,056
I know duty is more
important than love.

1468
02:24:41,148 --> 02:24:44,152
But what can I do?

1469
02:24:44,318 --> 02:24:47,060
I'm just so much in love
with you.

1470
02:24:47,255 --> 02:24:49,997
I've lost my peace of mind.

1471
02:24:50,124 --> 02:24:52,331
I can't sleep.

1472
02:24:54,395 --> 02:24:58,866
Husna, I honour you and
your love.

1473
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:02,309
I ask something of you today.

1474
02:25:03,671 --> 02:25:05,947
Forget me.

1475
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:08,714
Cast my love out of your heart.

1476
02:25:08,943 --> 02:25:12,550
Forget our dreams of
a life together.

1477
02:25:12,847 --> 02:25:15,953
We were going to travel
the road of life together.

1478
02:25:16,417 --> 02:25:19,626
Forget all that.
Forget it all.

1479
02:25:21,288 --> 02:25:24,098
I fold my hands
before you, Husna.

1480
02:25:43,177 --> 02:25:45,987
Whenever you see a
smouldering fire...

1481
02:25:47,914 --> 02:25:50,190
think of me.

1482
02:26:03,264 --> 02:26:07,371
And when you see a moth
burn in a flame

1483
02:26:07,835 --> 02:26:10,441
Think of me.

1484
02:26:15,109 --> 02:26:19,888
Anwar. My friend.

1485
02:26:22,483 --> 02:26:24,622
Forgive me.

1486
02:26:39,466 --> 02:26:46,577
"I lie sleepless,
thinking of you"

1487
02:26:46,774 --> 02:26:53,589
"I toss and turn all night"

1488
02:26:54,014 --> 02:26:56,688
"At every moment..."

1489
02:26:56,984 --> 02:27:06,166
"A flame burns in my heart
for you"

1490
02:27:07,995 --> 02:27:15,345
"Since you have turned
away from me"

1491
02:27:15,535 --> 02:27:21,349
"I am lonely, the night
is dark"

1492
02:27:22,076 --> 02:27:29,460
"Even the moon has hidden
itself..."

1493
02:27:29,583 --> 02:27:35,864
"The stars hardly come
out at all"

1494
02:28:02,383 --> 02:28:10,461
"Lost is that joy,
that celebration"

1495
02:28:10,791 --> 02:28:16,173
"Lost is the happy goal
of love"

1496
02:28:16,363 --> 02:28:23,508
"In the lonely lanes of life"

1497
02:28:23,637 --> 02:28:29,952
"only your memory stays
with me"

1498
02:28:54,701 --> 02:29:01,311
"I was so happy when I won you"

1499
02:29:01,475 --> 02:29:07,153
"But then I lost you"

1500
02:29:08,182 --> 02:29:13,182
"Our garden of joy lies crushed"

1501
02:29:50,758 --> 02:29:58,108
"How can I account for
our separation?"

1502
02:29:58,398 --> 02:30:04,508
"I know only how helpless I am"

1503
02:30:04,972 --> 02:30:13,790
"The sorrows of the heart"

1504
02:30:13,948 --> 02:30:19,455
"Stream out in tears"

1505
02:30:19,653 --> 02:30:25,433
"I lie sleepless,
thinking of you"

1506
02:30:25,726 --> 02:30:32,007
"I toss and turn all night"

1507
02:30:54,354 --> 02:30:58,200
By the order of the government!

1508
02:30:58,392 --> 02:31:03,034
This announcement is
made for everyone.

1509
02:31:03,263 --> 02:31:05,766
On the 18th of September,
on Sunday,"

1510
02:31:05,899 --> 02:31:07,845
...at 1O in the morning,

1511
02:31:08,001 --> 02:31:11,471
Nawab Buland Akhtar
Changezi's mansion...

1512
02:31:11,705 --> 02:31:17,451
and all its valuable contents
...will be auctioned.

1513
02:31:17,677 --> 02:31:23,389
Anyone can make a bid.

1514
02:31:23,617 --> 02:31:26,962
Come, make your bid.

1515
02:31:28,255 --> 02:31:32,226
Take advantage of this
golden opportunity.

1516
02:31:32,392 --> 02:31:34,872
Participate in the auction.

1517
02:31:35,062 --> 02:31:39,772
Buy the ancestral home of
the Changezi family.

1518
02:31:39,866 --> 02:31:42,870
Enhance your prestige.

1519
02:31:43,036 --> 02:31:46,677
By the order of the government!

1520
02:32:17,938 --> 02:32:19,008
Stop.

1521
02:32:19,139 --> 02:32:20,641
Everyone, leave.

1522
02:32:23,009 --> 02:32:25,387
Come in.

1523
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:29,156
It's a wonder you have
come to my house.

1524
02:32:29,283 --> 02:32:32,230
I'm amazed to see you in
this mausoleum.

1525
02:32:32,519 --> 02:32:35,557
So, Nawab Akhtar, how
do you come to be here?

1526
02:32:35,889 --> 02:32:39,462
My ancestral pride is
being auctioned.

1527
02:32:40,126 --> 02:32:43,039
I will write over my mansion,
my property to you.

1528
02:32:43,397 --> 02:32:45,741
Stop the auction.

1529
02:32:45,933 --> 02:32:47,935
I'll be beholden to you for life.

1530
02:32:48,035 --> 02:32:49,514
Very good.

1531
02:32:49,636 --> 02:32:51,980
You're finally seeing sense.

1532
02:32:52,105 --> 02:32:53,345
But you've come alone.

1533
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:55,750
You want to save your
ancestral pride.

1534
02:32:56,042 --> 02:32:57,953
I thought you'd bring
your sister along.

1535
02:33:00,414 --> 02:33:05,193
Anyone here?

1536
02:33:08,088 --> 02:33:10,694
Throw the Nawab out.

1537
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:19,236
You useless creatures.

1538
02:33:20,734 --> 02:33:23,510
Get out.

1539
02:33:40,954 --> 02:33:46,836
This mansion is being auctioned.

1540
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:50,906
Anyone can make a bid
and buy it.

1541

Rs. 1000/-.

1542

The court has fixed the minimum
price at Rs. 300,000!-

1543
02:34:01,641 --> 02:34:04,053
No lower bid will be entertained.

Make any offer over
Rs. 300,000.

1545

Rs. 650000]-

1556
02:34:44,618 --> 02:34:50,500
Dear Allah!
You protected us till today.

1557
02:34:52,292 --> 02:34:55,739
You saved us from disgrace
till now.

1558
02:34:57,064 --> 02:35:03,504
Why have You turned
away from our family?

1559
02:35:05,805 --> 02:35:10,618
Allah, if You rejoice
in our ruin...

1560
02:35:11,378 --> 02:35:14,484
Grant me a favour.

1561
02:35:15,715 --> 02:35:18,059
Grant me death.

1562
02:35:19,119 --> 02:35:21,759
I cannot bear to watch...

1563
02:35:21,855 --> 02:35:23,198
with my own eyes...

1564
02:35:23,356 --> 02:35:27,805
...my family's and my
brother's dishonour.

1565
02:35:28,929 --> 02:35:32,240
I beg of You.

1566
02:35:33,566 --> 02:35:36,638
Grant me death.

1567
02:35:42,376 --> 02:35:48,418
Rs. 825000]-

1568
02:35:48,615 --> 02:35:50,322
What are you staring at?

1569
02:35:50,484 --> 02:35:51,861
Such a grand mansion!

1570
02:35:52,018 --> 02:35:53,793
You won't find one
like it again.

1571
02:36:20,580 --> 02:36:27,225
To save my family's honour

1572
02:36:27,387 --> 02:36:30,596
Time and time again I have
paid a great price.

1573
02:36:32,058 --> 02:36:34,937
I took on my brother's debts.

1574
02:36:36,496 --> 02:36:38,533
Along with my own hopes...

1575
02:36:38,698 --> 02:36:44,205
I sacrificed Husna's young
life to this mansion.

1576
02:36:47,174 --> 02:36:49,654
But today -

1577
02:36:49,843 --> 02:36:53,052
The other day you sought to
buy love for your daughter.

1578
02:36:55,715 --> 02:36:58,696
Today I offer myself for sale.

1579
02:36:58,852 --> 02:37:00,627
You'll get the proper price.

1580
02:37:00,754 --> 02:37:03,234
Tell me. What price had
you in mind?

1581
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:08,867
Don't be embarrassed.

1582
02:37:09,029 --> 02:37:10,906
We're trading in love.

1583
02:37:11,097 --> 02:37:14,169
Think it over and name your
price openly.

1584
02:37:14,434 --> 02:37:17,677
You're lucky to find a
buyer like me.

1585
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:23,711
I need a million rupees.

1586
02:37:23,843 --> 02:37:26,551
Is that all?
A million rupees?

1587
02:37:26,746 --> 02:37:29,352
Looks like you don't know
your own value.

1588
02:37:29,583 --> 02:37:31,426
Increase your price.

1589
02:37:31,618 --> 02:37:34,929
No, I only need
a million rupees.

1590
02:37:35,088 --> 02:37:41,164
But before I pay it,
I need an assurance.

1591
02:37:41,294 --> 02:37:42,967
You needn't worry.

1592
02:37:43,129 --> 02:37:45,336
I'll be back very soon.

1593
02:37:46,533 --> 02:37:49,639
Then I'll be your slave for life.

1594
02:37:49,769 --> 02:37:52,443
Son, what are you saying?

1595
02:37:52,572 --> 02:37:55,143
You'll come to this Raunaq
Mahal as a groom.

1596
02:37:55,341 --> 02:37:57,184
And live here as the master.

1597
02:37:57,911 --> 02:38:00,482
May Allah grant you both
long lives.

1598
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:06,091
Allah, I cannot bear such
disgrace to my ancestors.

1599
02:38:06,753 --> 02:38:11,395
I cannot watch this with
my own eyes.

1600
02:38:11,624 --> 02:38:14,195
Therefore I am ending my life.

1601
02:38:15,328 --> 02:38:23,042
God, I see this suicide
as a sacrifice.

1602
02:38:25,305 --> 02:38:27,683
Don't condemn it as a sin.

1603
02:38:34,247 --> 02:38:35,885
My brother.

1604
02:38:36,616 --> 02:38:39,392
You'll drink poison and
escape this misery.

1605
02:38:41,121 --> 02:38:44,227
What will happen to me
after you're gone?

1606
02:38:45,758 --> 02:38:47,795
In this merciless world..

1607
02:38:47,927 --> 02:38:50,703
...full of greedy wolfish
creatures...

1608
02:38:50,897 --> 02:38:55,676
how would I preserve my
honour or the family's?

1609
02:39:03,176 --> 02:39:07,386
If, after you're gone -

1610
02:39:07,614 --> 02:39:13,565
I also have to dance on
stage like Najma -

1611
02:39:15,622 --> 02:39:18,831
...then the world will
look upon me...

1612
02:39:18,959 --> 02:39:23,339
...with the same contempt
as you see Najma today.

1613
02:39:27,901 --> 02:39:30,643
I' m your sister.

1614
02:39:30,837 --> 02:39:33,579
I also have a sensitive heart.

1615
02:39:34,274 --> 02:39:37,448
I can't watch this tragedy
take place either.

1616
02:39:39,078 --> 02:39:42,116
I would rather die.

1617
02:39:42,415 --> 02:39:47,057
Come, my brother.
Let us both take poison.

1618
02:39:47,186 --> 02:39:50,133
And wipe out this
entire family.

1619
02:39:59,299 --> 02:40:02,439
This is crazy!
This cannot be.

1620
02:40:02,602 --> 02:40:05,913
Forgive me, Husna.

1621
02:40:06,172 --> 02:40:07,981
I'd become blind.

1622
02:40:08,308 --> 02:40:11,118
I thought only of myself.
Not of you.

1623
02:40:13,913 --> 02:40:18,794
If only you were already married
to a decent boy like Anwar.

1624
02:40:20,253 --> 02:40:23,928
If you had left this
mansion as a bride

1625
02:40:24,090 --> 02:40:30,268
I would never have let my
ancestral home be sold.

1626
02:40:31,565 --> 02:40:34,705
I'd have destroyed it
myself first.

1627
02:40:35,068 --> 02:40:39,676
Nawab, a man loses his honour...

1628
02:40:39,939 --> 02:40:42,647
...when he loses truth
and integrity.

1629
02:40:44,577 --> 02:40:48,150
A man loses his honour when
he sells his soul.

1630
02:40:48,448 --> 02:40:51,395
And humanity. And decency.

1631
02:40:52,452 --> 02:40:55,763
Selling inanimate houses
doesn't rob him of his honour.

1632
02:40:58,358 --> 02:41:02,932
But if you still think honour
belongs to those...

1633
02:41:03,229 --> 02:41:05,402
...who live in mansions...

1634
02:41:05,665 --> 02:41:08,202
...then here are the title
deeds to your house.

1635
02:41:08,702 --> 02:41:11,114
Your entire debt has
been cleared.

1636
02:41:11,804 --> 02:41:13,477
The mansion won't be
auctioned, Nawab.

1637
02:41:28,154 --> 02:41:31,465
While life goes on...

1638
02:41:32,325 --> 02:41:35,772
a man won't let his friend's
honour be auctioned.

1639
02:41:37,163 --> 02:41:39,234
Don't misunderstand me.

1640
02:41:39,833 --> 02:41:42,541
Whatever I did was done in
the name of friendship.

1641
02:41:43,270 --> 02:41:46,479
Anwar, my friend,
let the house go.

1642
02:41:46,606 --> 02:41:48,449
I care nothing for this
grandeur now.

1643
02:41:48,708 --> 02:41:50,585
I regret my actions.

1644
02:41:50,743 --> 02:41:54,190
I have been very unfair
to you and Husna.

1645
02:41:54,414 --> 02:41:57,293
In the name of our friendship

1646
02:41:57,483 --> 02:42:01,295
Don't blame me too much,
Accept Husna's hand. Anwar.

1647
02:42:01,487 --> 02:42:05,435
I'm afraid that day will
never come.

1648
02:42:07,093 --> 02:42:09,869
No, Anwar. Don't say that.
Don't take revenge on me.

1649
02:42:09,996 --> 02:42:12,442
I beg of you.

1650
02:42:13,699 --> 02:42:15,372
I'm helpless.

1651
02:42:15,635 --> 02:42:17,273
But why?

1652
02:42:19,105 --> 02:42:21,381
I've promised Naseemara
I'll marry her.

1653
02:42:37,724 --> 02:42:42,724
Husna, I'm to blame.

1654
02:42:51,004 --> 02:42:52,881
Forgive me.

1655
02:42:53,506 --> 02:42:58,046
I've wronged you.

1656
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:49,863
I'm leaving Lucknow for ever.

1657
02:43:52,465 --> 02:43:55,241
Join me in my
journey through life.

1658
02:43:57,804 --> 02:43:59,806
Accept my hand, Najma.

1659
02:44:02,942 --> 02:44:07,118
I'm not worthy of you.
Leave me to my devices.

1660
02:44:08,848 --> 02:44:10,623
I'm very ashamed of what
I have done.

1661
02:44:10,783 --> 02:44:12,456
Forgive me if you can.

1662
02:44:16,456 --> 02:44:19,835
Najma, I have so much
to say to you.

1663
02:44:36,042 --> 02:44:37,282
Can I come in, Aunt?

1664
02:44:37,510 --> 02:44:42,926
Come, come. You've
come at a good time.

1665
02:44:44,818 --> 02:44:47,458
I've ordered some jewellery
for Naseemarefs wedding.

1666
02:44:47,687 --> 02:44:49,826
What do you think of it?

1667
02:44:50,156 --> 02:44:52,033
Beautiful.

1668
02:44:52,358 --> 02:44:55,931
You saved my honour by giving
Anwar that money.

1669
02:44:56,195 --> 02:44:58,471
I've come to thank you.

1670
02:44:58,698 --> 02:45:00,268
What's there to thank me for?

1671
02:45:00,466 --> 02:45:03,811
I did it for Naseemarefs happiness.

1672
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:06,912
May God bless Naseemara
and Anwar.

1673
02:45:07,106 --> 02:45:09,450
Here you are, Naseemara.
Your wedding present.

1674
02:45:10,310 --> 02:45:13,154
I've transferred the
mansion to you.

1675
02:45:13,879 --> 02:45:15,790
I'm leaving Lucknow for ever.

1676
02:45:20,186 --> 02:45:23,827
There comes a time in
one's life...

1677
02:45:24,257 --> 02:45:27,534
...when one loses something
but gains a lot.

1678
02:45:28,894 --> 02:45:31,568
I won't let you go before
my wedding.

1679
02:45:32,264 --> 02:45:35,643
Who else do I have to call my own?
No elder person.

1680
02:45:35,835 --> 02:45:38,475
Won't you tie the sehra
for your sister?

1681
02:45:39,806 --> 02:45:43,015
Won't you be at my side?

1682
02:45:43,576 --> 02:45:48,582
If you think of me as
your sister

1683
02:45:48,714 --> 02:45:52,218
...you must fulfill your
duty to me.

1684
02:45:54,620 --> 02:45:58,193
After what you have
done for me

1685
02:45:59,092 --> 02:46:05,634
I'm willing to fulfill
your every wish.

1686
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:08,841
Thank you very much.

1687
02:46:09,268 --> 02:46:12,374
Aunt, offer him a sweetmeat.

1688
02:46:12,505 --> 02:46:14,542
Come with me.

1689
02:46:38,431 --> 02:46:42,140
Mulla, you can start
the rites.

1690
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:49,713
We are starting the
wedding rites.

1691
02:46:49,909 --> 02:46:52,219
To marry you to Mirza
Anwar Hussain...

1692
02:46:52,478 --> 02:46:56,620
...a bride price of Rs.5000OI-,
has been paid.

1693
02:46:57,049 --> 02:47:00,053
Are you willing?
Are you willing?

1694
02:47:00,252 --> 02:47:03,392
Say "yes", child.

1695
02:47:14,634 --> 02:47:17,444
We start the wedding rites...

1696
02:47:19,238 --> 02:47:25,553
...to marry you to Mirza Asghar
Hussain's daughter Husna.

1697
02:47:32,785 --> 02:47:35,095
Are you willing?

1698
02:47:48,734 --> 02:47:54,150
See how surprised Anwar is to
see I'm not the bride.

1699
02:47:54,740 --> 02:48:00,656
He thought he's sold his love.
And I had bought it.

1700
02:48:00,847 --> 02:48:04,761
Who'll explain to him?
Love is worship.

1701
02:48:04,984 --> 02:48:10,491
Love is to be felt.
Not bought. Not sold.

1702
02:48:10,756 --> 02:48:12,633
Are you willing?

1703
02:48:12,858 --> 02:48:15,668
The groom is a little bewildered.
Will my word do?

1704
02:48:15,828 --> 02:48:17,364
Shut up.

1705
02:48:17,763 --> 02:48:19,208
Sorry, father-in-law.

1706
02:48:19,498 --> 02:48:21,774
Are you willing?

1707
02:49:09,615 --> 02:49:18,558
"I caught but a glimpse
of you once"

1708
02:49:19,024 --> 02:49:28,035
"I long to meet you again"

1709
02:49:28,467 --> 02:49:37,683
"Your shadow is
a Taj Mahal to me"

1710
02:49:38,110 --> 02:49:46,325
"Let me woo you on
a starlit night"

1711
02:49:47,653 --> 02:49:55,629
"Let your fragrant curls
