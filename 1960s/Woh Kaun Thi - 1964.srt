3
00:00:58,762 --> 00:00:59,762
Can't you hear?

4
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:02,895
Move out of the way.

5
00:01:06,292 --> 00:01:07,329
Who are you?

6
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,149
Nobody.

7
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,149
Where do you want to go?

8
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:16,989
Nowhere.

9
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:26,911
But you are alone so
late in this rainy night.

10
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,513
I am not alone.

11
00:01:31,678 --> 00:01:33,079
You must be going somewhere.

12
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:38,233
You can't take me to
where I want to go.

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,017
Is it very far?

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,988
It is very near.

15
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:43,800
No way for the car to travel?

16
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:48,229
There are many ways.
But you can't go there.

17
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,671
Look, I am a doctor. Don't fear me.

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,137
I am not afraid of any human being.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,316
Then come and sit in the car.

20
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,148
I will escort you
to wherever you say.

21
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,479
But you will ask me many questions.

22
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,593
If you don't want, I won't ask you.

23
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:15,295
You won't ask anything, will you?

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,238
No. Come.

25
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:51,753
It's so strange.
The wipers were working.

26
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:55,229
It's difficult to drive.
I can't see the road.

27
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:56,829
I can see it.

28
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:02,072
You can? But the road
is not at all visible.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,751
The road is clear. Drive straight.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,229
There is a pit ahead.
Go from the right.

31
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:22,239
What happened to your finger?

32
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,672
- Blood.
- Blood?

33
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,230
- I got a cut from a blade.
- How?

34
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:32,999
It happens quite often.

35
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,478
While sharpening the
pencil for the portrait.

36
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:38,908
Strange! You can
see the way in dark.

37
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:40,672
But you can't see
the blade in light.

38
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,755
You should have
applied some ointment.

39
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:45,752
I like blood.

40
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,070
You like blood? Why?

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,749
You only said that you
won't ask any question.

42
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,434
- Stop.
- Here?

43
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:10,669
I want to get down here.

44
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,751
In this lonely place.
This is a graveyard.

45
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,870
But where will you go in this place?

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,594
You said that you
won't ask any question.

47
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:11,676
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

48
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:19,174
"Beloved, I am
waiting for you to come."

49
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:26,710
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

50
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:33,981
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

51
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:58,589
Mother.

52
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Son, you have come?

53
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,373
You have still not gone to sleep!

54
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,911
You always ask this whenever
you are late. How was the feast?

55
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:07,149
The feast?

56
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:09,413
I completely forgot, mother!

57
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:11,721
I'll just be back. They must
be waiting for me at the feast.

58
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:12,989
Who?

59
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,657
Those who are giving the feast.

60
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,331
Strange guy!

61
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,485
Hello, Seema.

62
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,646
Seema, what do I tell you!

63
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:07,817
Today, such a strange
thing happened. If I told you..

64
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,967
- Good evening, Rosy.
- Good morning.

65
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,810
- Rosy, good evening.
- I said good morning.

66
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,124
From where are you
coming all drenched up?

67
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,135
I had gone to check on a patient.
I got late there.

68
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,968
Why don't you clearly
say that you forgot?

69
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:27,177
You forgot that there
is a girl called Seema.

70
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,887
She is waiting for you
at dinner. She is awake.

71
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,645
I had forgotten, Seema.

72
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,969
But what do I tell you?
Doctor's profession is such.

73
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,727
Good that you
forgot before marriage.

74
00:09:40,002 --> 00:09:41,728
Don't forget after marriage.

75
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:44,004
What do I tell you, Seema?
It's so strange.

76
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,136
Do you know? Today I saw a ghost.

77
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:48,486
Ghost!

78
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:49,756
Ghost!

79
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,126
I am not talking about you.

80
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,409
Female or male?

81
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:56,966
A female.

82
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:58,331
Young or old?

83
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,726
Very young.

84
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:03,137
Then you must have seen one.
Have food.

85
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,409
You think I am joking! I am serious.

86
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:07,565
While I was returning..

87
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:09,728
She was standing in
the middle of the road.

88
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,726
In the dead of the night..
Isolated place.

89
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,331
And heavy rainfall. I
gave her a lift in my car.

90
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:16,646
Then?

91
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:19,809
As soon as she sat, the
wipers stopped working.

92
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,485
It was difficult to drive.

93
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:25,127
That's why I forbid you from
giving a lift to all girls.

94
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,887
See? Now even spirits have
started stopping your path.

95
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,968
I couldn't see the road properly.

96
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,410
But she could see it clearly.

97
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,330
She gave the directions.
And I drove the car.

98
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,057
On her saying, I
stopped the car at one place.

99
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:39,976
I saw that it is a graveyard.

100
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,249
She got down from
the car and slowly..

101
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,937
Started walking
towards the graveyard.

102
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,412
The graveyard's gate
opened on its own.

103
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:48,136
And then it closed.

104
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,808
She disappeared in front of my eyes.

105
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,633
After as soon as she disappeared
the wipers started working.

106
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:54,726
What!

107
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,497
Seema, have you ever seen a ghost?

108
00:10:57,577 --> 00:11:01,570
Yes! I saw it once! In Darjeeling!
It followed me.

109
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:03,032
But the ghost got scared
from you and ran away.

110
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:04,968
Yes, yes! No, no! I will tell you.

111
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,126
Rosy!

112
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:09,126
I am sorry. I am sorry.

113
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:13,489
Oh, my God! Graveyard!

114
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:22,967
Hello! Yes, yes. Doctor, your ghost.

115
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:24,896
I mean, a call for you.

116
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,488
This is Lata calling
from the hospital.

117
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,329
There is an urgent case.
Come quickly.

118
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,568
But who told you that I am here.

119
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,650
I tried at many places.
I even called at home.

120
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:43,248
Then I thought maybe
in your romantic mood..

121
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,736
You will be with somebody.

122
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,889
My guess was right, wasn't it?

123
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:48,570
What do I say about your guess?

124
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:50,569
You are more than just a doctor.

125
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,127
Yes. But you don't understand.

126
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,975
It's an urgent case. Come soon.

127
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,975
Fine, I'll just come. Okay.

128
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,975
- Hospital?
- Yes.

129
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:03,897
- Do you have to leave right now?
- Yes.

130
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,969
- What about dinner?
- It's an urgent case.

131
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:14,126
I love you.

132
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:28,326
Dr. Singh.

133
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:30,135
Yes, what can I do for you?

134
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,726
I am Ratilal M. Padamsee, solicitor.

135
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:35,733
- I am representing Padamsee & Padamsee.
- Yes.

136
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:37,729
There is a doctor
Anand in your staff.

137
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,729
I need his certificates.

138
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:41,126
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

139
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:44,332
What kind of certificate
do you want for Dr. Anand?

140
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:46,135
A medical certificate.

141
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,727
To certify that Dr. Anand
is mentally stable.

142
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:51,967
Excuse me, daddy.
Can I have Mrs. Sethi's x-ray?

143
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:53,126
Oh, sure!

144
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,729
She is my daughter, Dr.
Lata. Padamsh's solicitor.

145
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,889
- Hello. - Hello.
- Listen to him. What were you saying?

146
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:09,131
I want a certificate to certify
that Dr. Anand is mentally stable.

147
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,725
Are you kidding?

148
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:17,966
Dr. Anand is one of the
best doctors in our staff.

149
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:23,734
He is as mentally stable
as you are. Are you fine?

150
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,409
Forgive me.
But Dr. Anand is very lucky.

151
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,488
He has inherited millions of rupees.

152
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:32,251
But the special clause
in the will is that..

153
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,329
The inheritor
should be mentally stable.

154
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,329
Otherwise some other heir
will inherit the wealth.

155
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:41,969
There have been instances of
insanity in Dr. Anand's family.

156
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:46,126
So the deceased person has
included this condition.

157
00:13:46,337 --> 00:13:47,975
It is only a technical matter.

158
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:49,126
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

159
00:13:50,178 --> 00:13:51,893
You had scared me.

160
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:54,126
I will give it to you.

161
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:57,726
What should I write?

162
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,968
This is to certify that Dr. Anand..

163
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,378
You are going to
inherit loads of wealth.

164
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,646
- Is that so?
- Yes.

165
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Listen..

166
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:11,126
Have you lost your mind?

167
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:14,977
I am telling you the truth.
You have inherited huge wealth.

168
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:17,332
- Really?
- You will be sent for very soon.

169
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:20,730
Doctor, a ma'am is calling you.

170
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:22,726
Right time.

171
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,808
Always. Tell her that
I will be there soon.

172
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:34,731
Excuse me. Can I help you?

173
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:35,966
Sure.

174
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:40,566
Thank you.

175
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:42,816
- Seema..
- Yes.

176
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,411
The lawyer and the
inheritance are waiting for you.

177
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,127
All this can wait.

178
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:54,332
But you should not keep a
beautiful lady waiting. Correct?

179
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:57,408
Listen! Don't
forget the dance today.

180
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,976
I will remember it.

181
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:17,332
Ladies, friends and doctors.

182
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:22,136
Thanks for coming here.

183
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,807
Don't worry. I won't
give a long speech.

184
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:31,250
Today, the doctors and
nurses in our hospital..

185
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:35,046
Will come in front
of you in a new form.

186
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:39,731
This item has been
prepared by Dr. Lata, Dr. Anand..

187
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:43,135
And his friend Ms. Seema.

188
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:47,136
Ladies and gentlemen,
kindly give them a good hand.

189
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,566
I thank you.

190
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,013
"Last night the one I
had met in my dreams."

191
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,351
"Are you that same person?"

192
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:32,571
"Tell me. Tell me.
Tell me. ""Tell me."

193
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:34,145
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

194
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:36,612
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

195
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,255
"Tell me."

196
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,253
"Yesterday I gave you my heart."

197
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,528
"What did you do with it?"

198
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,047
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

199
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,799
- "Tell me."
- "Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

200
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,967
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

201
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,649
"Tell me."

202
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:23,857
"I wish you some day look at
your beauty with my eyes."

203
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:28,647
"I gained the bliss of both the
worlds after giving my heart."

204
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:33,413
"I wish you some day look at
your beauty with my eyes."

205
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:38,446
"I gained the bliss of both the
worlds after giving my heart."

206
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:42,974
"Is there any other
gorgeous damsel like you?"

207
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:46,333
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

208
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,486
"Tell me."

209
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,042
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

210
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,490
"Tell me."

211
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:59,697
"Last night the one I
had met in my dreams."

212
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:01,577
"Are you that same person?"

213
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:21,407
"Beloved, your each
glance stole my heart."

214
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:26,252
"Beloved, all the time
your love robbed me."

215
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:30,808
"Beloved, your each
glance stole my heart."

216
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:35,947
"Beloved, all the time
your love robbed me."

217
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:40,493
"Should I sigh?
Tell me what should I do?"

218
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,568
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

219
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,249
"Tell me."

220
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,327
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

221
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,975
"Tell me."

222
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,177
"Yesterday I gave you my heart."

223
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:59,577
"What did you do with it?"

224
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:01,687
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

225
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:04,052
- "Tell me."
- "Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

226
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,412
"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."

227
00:19:06,497 --> 00:19:08,328
"Tell me."

228
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:21,454
And now everyone on the
floor please. I thank you.

229
00:19:47,257 --> 00:19:48,610
- Sorry.
- What sorry!

230
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:50,610
- Ramesh, you?
- Anand!

231
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:53,650
Meet him.
He is Mr. Ramesh. My uncle's son.

232
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:55,046
The prodigal son.

233
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:57,332
She is Ms. Seema.
Your future sister-in-law.

234
00:19:58,257 --> 00:19:58,902
What!

235
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,486
Your future sister-in-law.

236
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:02,333
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

237
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,695
Congratulations.
My brother is great!

238
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:08,771
He chooses any
beautiful thing that he sees.

239
00:20:08,857 --> 00:20:11,735
But Seema, my liking
doesn't change everyday like his.

240
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,393
Tell me. What are
you doing nowadays?

241
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:14,486
Twist.

242
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:18,329
It means you are still
saving yourself from working.

243
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,409
You can say that
work escapes from me.

244
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:24,250
Tell me. Is your
diary over or you are..

245
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:26,097
Still filling it
with your exciting deeds?

246
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:27,873
Seema, it's his childhood habit.

247
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:30,337
He writes each trivial
matter in his dairy.

248
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,645
What he ate, what he drank.

249
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:34,057
If we both have a fight,
he writes about that too.

250
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,968
That today Anand bashed me badly.

251
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:37,331
Everything is fine.

252
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:40,570
It's okay to keep a diary
and to fill it everyday.

253
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:43,326
But Ramesh hit Anand.

254
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:57,726
- Bye.
- Bye.

255
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,624
- Who are you?
- I am a man.

256
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:57,366
I can see that. Who are you?

257
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:01,034
No matter how you
see it, I am the same.

258
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:03,054
- What are you doing here?
- Working.

259
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,328
- Working!
- Service, service.

260
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,240
I can understand Hindi.
What is your name?

261
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:09,374
What can a poor man's name be, sir?

262
00:22:10,368 --> 00:22:12,713
- Call me whatever you want to.
- Would you tell me something?

263
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:15,729
What do I tell you?
My parents have named me Madhav.

264
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,487
But nobody calls a
poor man with his name.

265
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,966
Hey, you! Come here!

266
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,248
Somebody calls me fool or idiot!

267
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:24,407
- How did you come here?
- From the street.

268
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:25,691
- The street?
- Yes. -Yes.

269
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:28,248
Poor man was lying
on the street and..

270
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:29,873
Getting drenched in
the rain since many days.

271
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:32,047
I took pity on him. Ramu has left.

272
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,411
So I kept him as our servant.

273
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,886
Mother, you don't know a
person and you feel pity for him.

274
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,487
You appoint a man lying on
the street, your servant.

275
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,646
- Son.
- Yes.

276
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,033
You don't appoint those living
in bungalow as your servant.

277
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,570
You find them on the street only.

278
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,249
What is there to know?

279
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:49,969
I saw him shelter less.
And I gave him shelter.

280
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:51,566
Good.

281
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,650
- The weather is so lovely.
- Very.

282
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,896
- It is so cold.
- Yes.

283
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:10,132
- I am still not engaged.
- Yes.

284
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,968
I said I am still not engaged.

285
00:23:15,057 --> 00:23:16,968
- It won't happen too.
- Why?

286
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,177
Because we will first get married.

287
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:20,406
No need for engagement.

288
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,577
You always jest. Do
be serious sometimes.

289
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:27,657
Look, Seema. My position
at home is already serious.

290
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:29,977
If I also got serious, then
everything will be in a mess.

291
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:31,806
What do you mean?

292
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:33,576
Mother has given me the notice.

293
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,367
- What notice?
- To get married.

294
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,137
Mother is fixing my
alliance somewhere else.

295
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:42,487
What did you tell your mother?

296
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:46,251
Seema, before mother
selects some other girl..

297
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:49,727
It is very important
for you to meet mother.

298
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:54,126
- Anand.
- Yes.

299
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:56,727
What if mother didn't like me?

300
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:59,328
If mother didn't like you..

301
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:01,966
Very simple!

302
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:04,366
I will marry the
girl of mother's choice.

303
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,054
Then go! What are you doing here?

304
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:10,055
Romancing you.

305
00:24:11,057 --> 00:24:13,412
You love me and you
will marry somebody else.

306
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:14,966
What is the harm?

307
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,526
Why are you getting angry?

308
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:21,734
I'll marry you and
love somebody else. Happy?

309
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:26,571
Fine, I'll marry and
love only you. Happy?

310
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,410
- Very happy!
- Very good!

311
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:30,566
Leave my hand.

312
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:37,049
"Leaving the support of your love."

313
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:42,495
"Leaving the support of your love."

314
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:47,731
"Tell me. Where will I go?"

315
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:53,730
"I am afraid that in your arms."

316
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:59,654
"I am afraid that in your arms."

317
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:04,731
"Today I might die of happiness."

318
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:25,377
"The distances of the
heart have today bridged."

319
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:30,846
"I am standing near my destination."

320
00:25:31,337 --> 00:25:36,809
"When you smiled and glanced at me."

321
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:41,732
"All the grievances of
the heart disappeared."

322
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:47,730
"These precious
moments are so lovely."

323
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:52,972
"Tell it to stop here only."

324
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:58,970
"I am afraid that in your arms."

325
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:04,256
"Today I might die of happiness."

326
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:26,571
"I will offer my life to your feet."

327
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:31,972
"And the light of my eyes."

328
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,727
"If you are happy."

329
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:42,817
"Then I will bestow all the
happiness of my heart on yours."

330
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:49,015
"My beloved, my happiness lies in."

331
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:54,331
"Seeing you wherever I go."

332
00:26:54,817 --> 00:27:00,050
"Leaving the support of your love."

333
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:05,331
"Tell me. Where will I go?"

334
00:27:20,817 --> 00:27:25,652
"Seeing love in these eyes."

335
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:31,331
"Has lit the path with lamps."

336
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:34,457
"If I had not met you."

337
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:42,330
"Then this world would
have been a lonely place."

338
00:27:42,817 --> 00:27:48,335
"Tell your sighs."

339
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:53,332
"Not to ever come on your lips."

340
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:59,335
"Leaving the support of your love."

341
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:04,332
"Tell me. Where will I go?"

342
00:28:04,737 --> 00:28:10,334
"I am afraid that in your arms."

343
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:15,491
"Today I might die of happiness."

344
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:13,046
Seema?

345
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:14,526
Seema?

346
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:15,686
Seema, what happened?

347
00:29:16,057 --> 00:29:17,126
What happened to you?

348
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:18,646
What happened, Seema?

349
00:29:22,897 --> 00:29:23,966
What happened?

350
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:27,434
- Injection.
- What? Who?

351
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,329
Tell me.

352
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,126
Seema!

353
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:42,335
Cyanide's injection.

354
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:45,017
Sit down, inspector. Sit down.

355
00:29:46,737 --> 00:29:52,369
SP.. I think only
doctors have this poison.

356
00:29:54,577 --> 00:30:00,129
Doctors, nurses, chemist,
hospitals, laboratories. No!

357
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:02,655
No, inspector. You are mistaken.

358
00:30:03,057 --> 00:30:05,048
The oldest rule is the best rule.

359
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,332
You find the motive and
you find the murderer.

360
00:30:10,257 --> 00:30:16,048
First try to find out who will
benefit from Seema's murder.

361
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:20,257
And appoint two of
your special men..

362
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:23,966
To keep a tight tab on
Dr. Lata and Dr. Singh.

363
00:30:24,617 --> 00:30:27,495
- Dr. Singh?
- Yes.

364
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,811
Dr. Singh.

365
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:58,337
Madhav! Hey, Madhav!

366
00:30:58,417 --> 00:30:59,486
Yes, sir.

367
00:31:01,257 --> 00:31:03,033
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. I was sleeping.

368
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:05,651
You didn't return soon.
But I fell asleep quickly.

369
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,886
You have progressed a lot.

370
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:08,257
From the street to the compound.

371
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:09,462
From the compound to the hall.

372
00:31:09,486 --> 00:31:10,633
From here now go to my bedroom.

373
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:11,726
As you say, sir.

374
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:13,489
- Hey!
- Yes. Where are you going?

375
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,457
You told me to sleep in
the bedroom, didn't you?

376
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:17,966
- I told you to go to hell! Go!
- As you say, sir.

377
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:19,331
Why are you getting angry?

378
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:23,526
He just got up.
He is not fully awake.

379
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,963
You are saying something and
he is hearing something else.

380
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:27,799
- Madhav! Warm the food.
- Yes.

381
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:30,491
- I won't eat, Mother.
- Why?

382
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:32,906
I don't feel like eating anything.

383
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:37,330
I know, son. I am your mother.

384
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:40,048
I can understand your pain better.

385
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:43,491
But you don't die with the deceased.

386
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:48,331
Will Seema's soul find
peace seeing you in this state?

387
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:50,849
She is dead.

388
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,330
Had it been an extinguished lamp,
I'd have lit it again.

389
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,248
Now the only thing I
can do is to bring..

390
00:31:57,337 --> 00:31:59,976
Another girl to
take Seema's place.

391
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:02,968
It will alleviate your pain.

392
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:05,313
Daughter-in-law will
come in this house.

393
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:08,561
The isolation of this house, the
grief of your heart, my worries..

394
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,929
Everything will vanish.

395
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:13,700
Tell me, Anand. Answer me!

396
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:16,411
Say yes, son. Son, say yes.

397
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,058
Hello?

398
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,216
Dr. Anand speaking.

399
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:34,026
Yes, Dr. Anand speaking.

400
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:37,061
Sorry, doctor. You don't know me.

401
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,778
But a patient at our
home is very sick.

402
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:42,627
From where are you calling?

403
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:44,983
I am calling from the
public phone, doctor.

404
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,219
I don't know your
residential address.

405
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,785
I'll be waiting for you at
the post office circle, doctor.

406
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,140
Doctor, do come. Please, doctor.

407
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,267
Somebody's life and
death is at stake, doctor.

408
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:56,902
Please! Please, doctor!

409
00:32:57,818 --> 00:33:00,546
Post office circle.
Fine, I'll be right over.

410
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:03,982
Thank you. Thanks a lot, doctor.

411
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:14,707
Are you Dr. Anand?

412
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,585
Did you call me to
visit the patient?

413
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:17,947
- Yes, I had called.
- Come, sit.

414
00:33:18,027 --> 00:33:19,096
Hurry up, doctor.

415
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:23,506
- Where do we have to go?
- I will direct you the way.

416
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,536
Come, doctor.

417
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,016
Come, doctor.

418
00:34:21,547 --> 00:34:23,503
Extend your hand
towards the right side.

419
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:26,617
The candle is kept there. Light it.

420
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:43,857
Come. Come upstairs.

421
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:49,616
Come.

422
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:13,859
Such a huge house. And a
sick person. And no light!

423
00:35:14,627 --> 00:35:15,776
What do I tell you, doctor?

424
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:22,303
I am a poor man.
The radiance of the house is long gone.

425
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:47,780
Go away! Why have you come now!

426
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:52,740
My daughter is dead!
She is dead! She is dead!

427
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:11,779
My daughter is dead!
She is dead! You go away!

428
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:22,219
Take this doctor away!
He's a butcher! He's stone hearted.

429
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,616
- Doctor! Come with me.
- Take him away!

430
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:30,464
Take him away! Take him away!
I say take him away!

431
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:57,899
Doctor, I am sorry.

432
00:37:30,947 --> 00:37:32,016
Who are you?

433
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:35,017
I am a doctor. Dr. Anand.

434
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:36,776
Why did you come here?

435
00:37:39,787 --> 00:37:40,936
To see a patient.

436
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,095
- You entered this bungalow?
- Yes.

437
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:51,867
What's the matter, Inspector?

438
00:37:54,227 --> 00:37:56,457
Did somebody call
you to see the patient?

439
00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:58,856
Yes.

440
00:37:59,307 --> 00:38:00,899
And that patient
was a beautiful girl.

441
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:03,376
Yes.

442
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:05,618
And she died before you came here.

443
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:09,696
Yes.

444
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:12,298
And an old lady sitting
besides her was crying.

445
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,695
All this is true, inspector.
But how do you know it?

446
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:21,305
Doctor, I very well know that
this bungalow is vacant since ages.

447
00:38:24,027 --> 00:38:27,099
Such charades are common
during such stormy nights.

448
00:38:28,227 --> 00:38:30,900
And many doctors have
reported to the police.

449
00:38:31,707 --> 00:38:34,699
But we never found anything.

450
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,346
What are you saying, inspector?

451
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:39,998
That dead girl, that crying lady..

452
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:41,696
I saw them just
now with my own eyes.

453
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:50,301
- You come with me.
- Let's go.

454
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:51,696
Come.

455
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:53,096
You all stay here.

456
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:17,139
Come with me.

457
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:09,062
But here.. that dead girl..
That shrieking lady.. just..

458
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:13,618
Somebody's soul is wandering.

459
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:17,696
Come, doctor.

460
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:18,936
It's so strange!

461
00:40:19,947 --> 00:40:22,222
When I met that girl
for the first time..

462
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:24,867
She vanished in the graveyard.

463
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:27,617
- What?
- That man..

464
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,946
- Who?
- Nobody.

465
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:37,381
Come. Let's go, doctor.
There's no one here.

466
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,222
Bring me the tea.

467
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:50,776
- Paper.
- Paper.

468
00:40:51,227 --> 00:40:52,455
- Is this the paper?
- No.

469
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,987
The tea is fresh and
the paper is also fresh.

470
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,387
- Mother has returned from the temple?
- Not yet.

471
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,507
Why are you sweeping
early in the morning?

472
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:11,220
- Let me have tea.
- Sir, along with cleaning the body..

473
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:13,916
It is important to clean
the room in the morning too.

474
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:15,962
Madhav, wait.

475
00:41:25,307 --> 00:41:27,104
An unknown girl in railway accident.

476
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:29,662
Who is this unknown girl?

477
00:41:30,627 --> 00:41:33,221
The police are
investigating this accident.

478
00:41:36,251 --> 00:41:39,018
That same girl.. the same one.

479
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:41,096
Who is she, sir?

480
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:43,458
- How old is this paper?
- What do I know?

481
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:46,380
- How did it come here?
- How do I know that?

482
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:47,741
How did it come here?

483
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:50,298
How do I know that?
It must have come somehow.

484
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:52,296
Anything special?

485
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:38,987
Hello! Hello!
Dr. Anand! Is it doctor Anand?

486
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:42,946
Dr. Anand! Hello! Hello!

487
00:42:54,627 --> 00:42:57,425
- Did you send for me?
- Yes.

488
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,104
Last night you got a
call from the hospital.

489
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:02,418
And you disconnected the call. Why?

490
00:43:03,627 --> 00:43:04,987
That was a call from the hospital?

491
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:06,536
Of course.

492
00:43:06,947 --> 00:43:09,578
- I thought it was wrong number.
- Wrong number?

493
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:11,299
I thought it was
not some man's call.

494
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:16,740
What do you mean?
Wrong number, some man's call.

495
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,939
Do you realise, your patient
was so serious last night.

496
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:21,363
Luckily they found
me at the clinic..

497
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:23,147
Otherwise your
patient would have died.

498
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:24,907
And you would have
been at court right now.

499
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:27,456
What's the matter?

500
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:30,337
Nothing, sir.

501
00:43:32,107 --> 00:43:33,387
I was really worried last night.

502
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:36,366
If you remain worried then
what will happen to your patients?

503
00:43:37,387 --> 00:43:38,456
You are hiding something!

504
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:45,780
Nothing, sir. I.. I couldn't
sleep for the past 2-3 nights.

505
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:50,132
You couldn't sleep.

506
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:54,382
Anand, don't make a
mockery of yourself.

507
00:43:54,947 --> 00:43:57,222
I am observing, since
the time of Seema's death..

508
00:43:57,573 --> 00:43:59,733
Neither your mind nor
your heart is in your control.

509
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:01,300
You will ruin yourself.

510
00:44:02,547 --> 00:44:04,026
Sir, it is not in my control.

511
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:08,096
Anand, you should not
forget that you have a mother.

512
00:44:08,587 --> 00:44:10,020
And she has some right over you.

513
00:44:10,227 --> 00:44:12,866
If you won't fulfil her wishes,
then who else will?

514
00:44:14,067 --> 00:44:15,792
I have always
considered you as my dear one.

515
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:19,622
Your best interest
lies in getting married.

516
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:21,625
- Marry?
- Yes.

517
00:44:22,747 --> 00:44:25,531
For your best interest,
for your mother's happiness..

518
00:44:25,927 --> 00:44:29,973
And if you believe
then for my happiness too.

519
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:39,304
I have come to complain about Anand.

520
00:44:39,867 --> 00:44:42,097
- Complain?
- Yes.

521
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:44,191
Nowadays he has
lost interest in work.

522
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:46,910
I have come to imprison
him for his whole life.

523
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:49,459
But not behind bars.

524
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,381
In the bond of marriage
that can never be broken.

525
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:55,867
Oh! I got so scared.

526
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:57,888
That God knows what
punishment you will give him.

527
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,096
Doctor, what can a mother wish for?

528
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,381
That a daughter-in-law
comes in the house.

529
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:07,460
And the family lineage continues.

530
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:10,695
You don't worry. I have
explained everything to him.

531
00:45:11,227 --> 00:45:13,695
And he has not refused me.

532
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:17,542
Doctor, you have
convinced the unconvincing guy.

533
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,297
On your saying,
though he is a doctor..

534
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:24,096
He agreed to marry the
girl of his mother's choice.

535
00:45:24,704 --> 00:45:26,299
Everything was fixed.

536
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,807
He did not agree.
That's why it got delayed.

537
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:31,467
The alliance was fixed?

538
00:45:31,547 --> 00:45:33,036
Whom have you fixed
the alliance with?

539
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:34,456
She is a motherless girl.

540
00:45:34,947 --> 00:45:37,012
They live near my sister's house.

541
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:39,026
I have not seen the girl.

542
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:41,271
The matter was
communicated through my sister.

543
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,299
They are in great hurry.

544
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:47,541
This is really good.
Congratulations.

545
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,382
I had also come for the same thing.

546
00:45:49,627 --> 00:45:50,929
Now I'll take your leave.

547
00:45:52,865 --> 00:45:54,459
Thanks a lot, doctor.

548
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:57,616
You have always
considered Anand as your dear one.

549
00:45:58,227 --> 00:46:00,024
You always took care of him.

550
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:03,780
You improved his faltering life.

551
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:41,216
Even your name is Sandhya.

552
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:45,385
When your name is so pretty,
then how pretty will you be?

553
00:47:24,787 --> 00:47:26,283
I don't know as to
what is the connection..

554
00:47:26,307 --> 00:47:27,945
Of this gusty breeze with my life.

555
00:47:31,227 --> 00:47:33,297
Maybe tonight is the
night of stories..

556
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:35,147
And it will be spent
in narrating stories.

557
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:40,019
Listen, once there was a
stormy night like this one.

558
00:47:40,707 --> 00:47:43,301
As if many unseen
souls are shrieking.

559
00:47:44,107 --> 00:47:46,302
The shadow of the trees
is swaying like ghosts.

560
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,922
Suddenly there was a
strong blow of wind.

561
00:47:51,027 --> 00:47:52,460
The window curtains fluttered.

562
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,536
The glass kept here shattered.

563
00:47:56,227 --> 00:47:58,787
Then I received a call
to see a sick person.

564
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:02,939
Quickly I went to an
isolated bungalow to see the sick.

565
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:06,699
She was a beautiful girl.

566
00:48:07,707 --> 00:48:09,937
She was dead before I reached there.

567
00:48:10,827 --> 00:48:12,283
When I was returning.
I came to know..

568
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,696
That bungalow has been
unoccupied since ages.

569
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:17,779
And doctors keep coming here.

570
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:20,026
And that girl always dies.

571
00:48:20,303 --> 00:48:21,823
Sandhya, do you know
that girl's face..

572
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:28,961
You? How did you come here?

573
00:48:29,867 --> 00:48:33,701
Who are you? Who are you?

574
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:35,785
I say, who are you?

575
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:39,219
Why don't you say! Who are you!

576
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:50,016
What happened, son?

577
00:48:50,107 --> 00:48:51,222
What's the matter?

578
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:53,419
What happened, son?

579
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:55,866
Whom were you yelling at?

580
00:48:56,787 --> 00:48:58,346
Whom were you yelling at, son?

581
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,296
On my fate.

582
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:02,296
What's the matter?

583
00:49:05,707 --> 00:49:09,387
- Who is she, mother?
- She.. she..

584
00:49:09,467 --> 00:49:10,536
Yes! She!

585
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:13,030
Are you asking
about daughter-in-law?

586
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,456
- Daughter-in-law?
- Yes.

587
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,379
You fulfilled your obstinacy,
Mother.

588
00:49:25,707 --> 00:49:28,107
Instead of a daughter-in-law,
I don't know whom you have got.

589
00:49:28,547 --> 00:49:30,856
Neither you, nor I
know the consequence.

590
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:25,017
Excuse me.
Where can I meet Dr. Anand?

591
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,114
- He will be in his room.
- His room!

592
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:27,936
Yes.

593
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:30,468
- Hello, Anand!
- Ramesh, you?

594
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:33,106
Yes. It's me! Your forgotten cousin!

595
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:34,422
I have just come from home.

596
00:50:34,662 --> 00:50:35,798
From there, I came to know that..

597
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:37,494
You are at the
hospital day and night.

598
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:39,211
I thought I will meet you.

599
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:42,575
But you are very shameless.
You got married.

600
00:50:43,023 --> 00:50:44,903
And you didn't even give
me the invitation card.

601
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,412
Card is sent to those
whose address we know.

602
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,398
You are a wanderer.
Sometimes here. Sometimes there.

603
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:52,982
You are right. I returned
from Hong Kong this morning.

604
00:50:53,062 --> 00:50:54,973
And by tonight's
flight I am going to Delhi.

605
00:50:55,576 --> 00:50:58,225
I thought I should at least
congratulate you for your wedding.

606
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,305
Thank you.

607
00:50:59,378 --> 00:51:00,651
How is sister-in-law?

608
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:03,340
- Come in my cabin.
- Not right now.

609
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,220
I have to catch my flight.

610
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:07,334
After returning, I
will meet sister-in-law..

611
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:10,306
And take a grand
treat from you too.

612
00:51:10,386 --> 00:51:11,901
Sure! Sure! Sure!

613
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:13,973
- Doctor, come inside.
- I will just come.

614
00:51:14,142 --> 00:51:15,655
- Okay. All the best.
- Thank you.

615
00:51:15,735 --> 00:51:16,891
Okay.

616
00:51:26,422 --> 00:51:27,258
What is this?

617
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:30,415
Portraits made by daughter-in-law.
Look, how lovely it is!

618
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:32,131
Yellow mountains.

619
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:36,734
This lady who is smoking. So nice.

620
00:51:38,422 --> 00:51:39,491
Such a nice mansion.

621
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:52,811
Come, doctor.

622
00:51:53,124 --> 00:52:00,488
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

623
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:08,342
"Beloved, I am
waiting for you to come."

624
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:15,339
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

625
00:52:15,858 --> 00:52:19,338
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

626
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:21,333
"It is brimming with tears."

627
00:52:21,787 --> 00:52:23,140
"It is brimming with tears."

628
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:40,051
"Countless sorrows,
this loneliness."

629
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:43,976
"This disgrace of love."

630
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:51,049
"Countless sorrows,
this loneliness."

631
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:54,658
"This disgrace of love."

632
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:58,325
"This is how I spend all the night."

633
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:03,085
"Neither you nor death came."

634
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:06,140
"This glimmer of the bind."

635
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,495
"Is like some flame."

636
00:53:10,306 --> 00:53:17,737
"The henna of my hand."

637
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:24,901
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

638
00:53:24,981 --> 00:53:32,220
"Beloved, I am
waiting for you to come."

639
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:39,498
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

640
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:43,496
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

641
00:53:43,662 --> 00:53:45,493
"It is brimming with tears."

642
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:48,495
"It is brimming with tears."

643
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,211
How do you know this song?

644
00:53:56,822 --> 00:53:58,221
I have always known it.

645
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,812
I asked as to how
you know this song?

646
00:54:02,231 --> 00:54:03,300
I don't remember.

647
00:54:03,391 --> 00:54:04,831
Since when you have been singing it?

648
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:08,031
I don't remember. Actually..

649
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,942
You like this song
a lot, am I right?

650
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:13,700
You remember the song.

651
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:15,905
But you don't
remember how you learnt it.

652
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:18,391
You don't remember since
when you have been singing it.

653
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:23,591
I feel as if I have
been singing it forever.

654
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:28,543
- That's why you sing it everywhere?
- No. I..

655
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:29,871
Do you recognise this bungalow?

656
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:42,699
- I think I have seen it somewhere.
- When?

657
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:47,100
I don't remember.

658
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:49,391
Why don't you say that
you don't want to tell me?

659
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:51,111
When did you visit this bungalow?

660
00:54:52,391 --> 00:54:54,029
I didn't visit this bungalow.

661
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:57,311
I don't even know whether
such a bungalow exists or not.

662
00:54:57,431 --> 00:54:59,308
Then how did you draw this portrait?

663
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:05,300
Using my imagination.

664
00:55:05,711 --> 00:55:08,020
You said that you've seen
this bungalow somewhere.

665
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:14,105
Maybe I have seen its picture.

666
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,461
And from that picture,
you made this portrait.

667
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:22,227
If you don't like my
drawing portraits..

668
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:24,108
Then henceforth I won't do it.

669
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,391
What happened to your finger?

670
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:31,100
Nothing.

671
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,222
Say that it often gets
cut with the blade..

672
00:55:33,311 --> 00:55:35,950
Used to sharpen the pencil.
Say that you like blood!

673
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:40,220
You can't hide your
real face forever.

674
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:47,700
What have you done?

675
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:50,311
Daughter-in-law had
drawn such a nice portrait.

676
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:52,109
Mother, you have
only seen the portrait.

677
00:55:52,631 --> 00:55:53,950
But not her changing colours.

678
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,100
Why have you come here?

679
00:56:39,391 --> 00:56:42,110
To ask you why do
you stay away from me?

680
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:45,225
What is the need to hate me so much?

681
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,224
Need? As such there is
no need in the world.

682
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:52,108
The ground doesn't need the sky.

683
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,782
What was the need
for us to get married?

684
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,102
If it was possible.. I
would have asked my fate.

685
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:01,108
Why do you want to ask your fate?

686
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:05,626
Ask the fate of the person who
wanted to make a deal of happiness.

687
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:07,710
And he bought sorrow.

688
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,384
You are right.

689
00:57:13,231 --> 00:57:16,303
The arrival of a bride
covered with a veil..

690
00:57:16,657 --> 00:57:18,859
Had spread happiness all around.

691
00:57:20,631 --> 00:57:24,226
If I had known that
after the veil is removed..

692
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:26,665
All the happiness would
be converted into sorrows..

693
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:29,399
Then I would have
remained behind the veil.

694
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,226
From the day you have seen my face..

695
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:35,461
You have started hating me.

696
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,711
I have become the
thorn in your heart.

697
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,110
Not thorn, an incurable pain.

698
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:41,619
There is no cure for it.

699
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,867
What is my fault?

700
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:49,308
Fault? It is my fault. I was
searching for you everywhere.

701
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,940
I came in front of
you again and again.

702
00:57:52,356 --> 00:57:55,701
I married you to fill the
greatest void of my life.

703
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:58,864
I couldn't see beauty
in the living world.

704
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:01,545
So I brought a live
corpse from the world of dead.

705
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:05,387
She is very beautiful.
Like some crime.

706
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:08,223
I am so unlucky.

707
00:58:09,831 --> 00:58:13,949
Fate has revealed as
to how much you hate me.

708
00:58:15,711 --> 00:58:18,305
Now do tell me what the
reason of this hatred is?

709
00:58:56,711 --> 00:59:03,230
"Eyes are brimming..

710
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:10,706
With tears."

711
00:59:24,132 --> 00:59:31,711
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

712
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:39,221
"Beloved, I am
waiting for you to come."

713
00:59:39,311 --> 00:59:46,626
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

714
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:50,546
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

715
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:52,469
"It is brimming with tears."

716
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:54,463
"It is brimming with tears."

717
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:58,307
"I am an incomplete saga."

718
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:02,020
"If you remember it, then come."

719
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:10,111
"See what my plight
has become without you."

720
01:00:10,471 --> 01:00:13,471
"The eyes filled with tears."

721
01:00:14,017 --> 01:00:16,863
"Makes the eyes glitter."

722
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:24,861
"The forlorn eyes are morose."

723
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:32,027
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

724
01:00:32,231 --> 01:00:35,940
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

725
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:37,949
"It is brimming with tears."

726
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:39,703
"It is brimming with tears."

727
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:19,385
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

728
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:27,026
"Beloved, I am
waiting for you to come."

729
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:34,381
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

730
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:35,950
"Eyes.."

731
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:43,620
Temple's offering.

732
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:15,757
Ma'am! Ma'am!

733
01:04:17,129 --> 01:04:18,198
What happened?

734
01:04:18,969 --> 01:04:20,960
- He has come.
- Who?

735
01:04:21,049 --> 01:04:23,768
The saint. He is a devout saint.

736
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:25,527
He was not ready to come.

737
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:27,661
With great difficulty,
I convinced him to come here.

738
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:29,289
Why have you brought him here?

739
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:35,126
Because his presence
vanquishes evil spirits.

740
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,689
That's why I have brought him here.

741
01:04:36,769 --> 01:04:38,680
Show your daughter-in-law to him.

742
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:40,361
He will surely give some solution.

743
01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:43,044
- You did the right thing.
- Come. Come.

744
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:53,959
What radiance!

745
01:04:54,369 --> 01:04:57,520
His eyes are shut but
he can see everything.

746
01:04:59,449 --> 01:05:02,122
Saint! Saint!

747
01:05:05,169 --> 01:05:06,966
- It's you.
- Yes.

748
01:05:08,129 --> 01:05:09,448
I will leave now.

749
01:05:09,529 --> 01:05:10,848
Why? What's the matter?

750
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:12,197
Saint, what is her fault?

751
01:05:12,362 --> 01:05:16,761
It's nobody's fault. I
can't stay in this house.

752
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:18,687
Many things exist here.

753
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:20,518
Many things?

754
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:24,444
Yes. You are not
alone in this house.

755
01:05:24,689 --> 01:05:26,441
There is somebody else too.

756
01:05:27,129 --> 01:05:29,518
My son is there.
My daughter-in-law is there.

757
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:33,841
Daughter-in-law! She is
not your daughter-in-law!

758
01:05:34,369 --> 01:05:37,122
She is a wandering soul.

759
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:41,443
She will never leave
this place. Never.

760
01:05:41,969 --> 01:05:45,757
Have mercy, saint. You be seated.
I will bring her.

761
01:05:45,913 --> 01:05:49,359
Sister, she won't
come in front of me.

762
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:51,935
The evil spirit that
has captured her..

763
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,962
That won't let her
come in front of me.

764
01:05:55,344 --> 01:05:58,679
If you don't believe me,
then try it out.

765
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:02,678
Go! Bring her in front of me. Go!

766
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:07,119
She won't come. She will never come.

767
01:06:07,525 --> 01:06:10,362
Hail the Lord, that's the Truth.

768
01:06:16,883 --> 01:06:19,437
- What are you doing, dear?
- Nothing, Mother.

769
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:22,124
I was just sitting. Sit.

770
01:06:22,689 --> 01:06:24,122
At times do come downstairs too.

771
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,759
Don't you feel
anxious sitting here alone?

772
01:06:28,849 --> 01:06:30,965
Now I am used to living alone.

773
01:06:31,689 --> 01:06:36,046
Young girls should not stay alone.
It diverts their mind.

774
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:40,762
And it veils the mind from
what is right and wrong.

775
01:06:41,733 --> 01:06:44,204
I didn't see anything around me.

776
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:48,046
Dear, you don't see these spectres.

777
01:06:48,809 --> 01:06:51,846
Only a learned man and
saint can recognise it.

778
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:54,965
Those who don't
recognise their own self..

779
01:06:55,049 --> 01:06:56,569
What will the
saints recognise them?

780
01:06:56,969 --> 01:07:00,200
Dear, don't say this.
They are ascetics.

781
01:07:00,587 --> 01:07:02,357
And with the power
of their penance..

782
01:07:02,437 --> 01:07:04,040
They can ward away many spectres.

783
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:07,965
Come downstairs with me.
Madhav has brought a saint.

784
01:07:08,669 --> 01:07:09,758
Why, Mother?

785
01:07:10,129 --> 01:07:12,841
He says, if somebody is
possessed by an evil spirit..

786
01:07:12,921 --> 01:07:14,040
Then he wards it off.

787
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:16,360
He can even ward off
ghosts and phantoms.

788
01:07:16,849 --> 01:07:18,840
But what will I do by meeting him?

789
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:22,042
Go and sit there quietly.

790
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:24,839
No, Mother. I won't go.

791
01:07:26,769 --> 01:07:29,442
I know why you are refusing.

792
01:07:29,969 --> 01:07:31,857
The saint had said that
this girl won't come..

793
01:07:31,937 --> 01:07:34,438
In front of me no matter what.

794
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:39,042
Mother, I am fine.
Believe me. I am fine.

795
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,759
Then why are you
refusing to meet him?

796
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:48,367
Mother, already fate
has humiliated me a lot.

797
01:07:49,578 --> 01:07:53,608
My husband doesn't
even want to see my face.

798
01:07:55,086 --> 01:07:57,046
I have lost my self-respect.

799
01:07:58,609 --> 01:08:01,362
Now don't humiliate me more
by taking me to the saint.

800
01:08:02,689 --> 01:08:05,840
I beg you. Don't make my
mockery in this house.

801
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:09,838
I am the daughter-in-law of
this house. I am the honour.

802
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:12,769
Besides this, I don't
have any other identity.

803
01:08:13,873 --> 01:08:16,433
I don't have any other identity!
I don't have any other identity!

804
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:14,044
- Nurse! Who passed my room just now?
- Nobody.

805
01:09:14,435 --> 01:09:16,040
But I heard somebody's footsteps.

806
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:17,358
I didn't see anybody.

807
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:21,442
- Who switched off the light?
- I don't know.

808
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:23,961
- You may go.
- Goodnight, doctor.

809
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,678
Don't switch it on.

810
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:55,118
You!

811
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:57,758
And here!

812
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,441
- I have come to take you.
- Where?

813
01:10:03,569 --> 01:10:07,767
Where it's isolated. And
there is nobody, besides us.

814
01:10:09,089 --> 01:10:11,444
Where I can talk to you in leisure.

815
01:10:12,049 --> 01:10:13,528
Can't we talk at home?

816
01:10:14,209 --> 01:10:17,758
Home! Ask yourself!

817
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:21,598
How much did you speak
to me at home till date?

818
01:10:22,809 --> 01:10:25,118
At home, I have received
nothing except your hatred.

819
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:27,949
If home had been home for me..

820
01:10:28,178 --> 01:10:29,745
Then why would I
have come here today?

821
01:10:29,769 --> 01:10:33,205
Oh! So you have
come here to complain.

822
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,119
Have you ever given me
the right to complain?

823
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,848
- Come with me.
- Listen.

824
01:10:43,969 --> 01:10:45,038
Let's go home.

825
01:10:45,689 --> 01:10:47,520
Now you won't have any
complain in that house.

826
01:10:47,969 --> 01:10:51,041
No! I will choke in that house.

827
01:10:52,477 --> 01:10:55,129
I want to breathe free air.

828
01:10:56,311 --> 01:10:59,122
Open air, where I can talk openly.

829
01:11:02,169 --> 01:11:06,048
Let's go. Where it
is completely silent.

830
01:11:16,289 --> 01:11:22,125
Open air. Open surrounding.
Soft sand.

831
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:28,123
Is it that you don't
like all this too, like me?

832
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:30,361
You tell me why you
have brought me here?

833
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:34,367
To solve the biggest
question of my life.

834
01:11:34,769 --> 01:11:35,838
What question?

835
01:11:36,969 --> 01:11:38,038
Do you know?

836
01:11:39,432 --> 01:11:42,680
Somebody was wandering for
lifetimes in your search.

837
01:11:44,129 --> 01:11:45,198
Do you know?

838
01:11:46,244 --> 01:11:48,962
In the bleakness of the world..
So many times..

839
01:11:49,049 --> 01:11:51,768
You almost escaped from her grasp.

840
01:11:52,329 --> 01:11:54,445
This.. what are you saying?

841
01:11:55,528 --> 01:12:00,842
And now to win you, those
unfulfilled desires of lifetimes..

842
01:12:01,667 --> 01:12:03,042
Got converted into a girl.

843
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:05,278
And you are that girl.

844
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:13,602
Yes, my life partner.
I am that girl.

845
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:18,200
Being with her, you
stay away from her.

846
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:22,284
Sandhya, I take a step towards you.

847
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:24,960
I don't know who stops me.

848
01:12:25,769 --> 01:12:27,600
I want to touch your beauty.

849
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:30,040
I don't know why my hands stop.

850
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,960
When I lift my eyes I
feel as if there is..

851
01:12:33,243 --> 01:12:35,040
A veil between you and me.

852
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:41,519
What else can that fate
be except my misfortune?

853
01:12:41,769 --> 01:12:43,361
I don't understand anything,
Sandhya.

854
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:45,729
What I should do and
what I should not.

855
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:51,963
Fill your palms with
my anguished beauty..

856
01:12:52,049 --> 01:12:53,118
And look at it closely.

857
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:58,042
Let my tresses
spread over your shoulder.

858
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:07,207
Today, rip apart all those
curtains and hold my hands.

859
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:15,760
"Embrace me."

860
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:25,840
"This lovely twilight."

861
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:37,438
"Embrace me."

862
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:45,689
"This lovely twilight
might not come again."

863
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:54,769
"Maybe we won't meet again."

864
01:13:57,861 --> 01:14:00,199
"Embrace me."

865
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:08,449
"This lovely twilight
might not come again."

866
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:17,119
"Maybe we won't meet again."

867
01:14:20,209 --> 01:14:23,042
"Embrace me."

868
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:50,049
"Our destiny has given
us these moments today."

869
01:14:55,854 --> 01:15:03,854
"Our destiny has given
us these moments today."

870
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:14,969
"Let me see you closely
to my heart's content."

871
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:23,043
"You might not be destined

872
01:15:23,129 --> 01:15:28,840
for these moments again."

873
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:36,920
"Maybe we won't meet again."

874
01:15:39,969 --> 01:15:42,767
"Embrace me."

875
01:16:01,809 --> 01:16:04,044
"Come closer to me."

876
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:11,445
"I won't come to
you again and again."

877
01:16:15,562 --> 01:16:17,679
"Come closer to me."

878
01:16:17,769 --> 01:16:24,766
"I won't come to
you again and again."

879
01:16:26,369 --> 01:16:31,124
"Take me in your arms."

880
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:35,442
"And let me cry to
my heart's content."

881
01:16:37,369 --> 01:16:41,965
"These tears of love might not

882
01:16:42,049 --> 01:16:48,045
be shed again from the eyes."

883
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:56,209
"Maybe we won't meet again."

884
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:01,284
"Embrace me."

885
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:09,529
"This lovely twilight
might not come again."

886
01:17:10,129 --> 01:17:18,129
"Maybe we won't meet again."

887
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:23,602
"Embrace me."

888
01:17:51,689 --> 01:17:54,442
- It is raining.
- So what?

889
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:56,118
You will get drenched.

890
01:17:57,849 --> 01:18:00,044
Today I feel like getting drenched.

891
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:05,889
Why are you looking at me like this?

892
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:08,759
Today, I want to see you
to my heart's content.

893
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,838
Sandhya!

894
01:19:04,609 --> 01:19:05,678
It's so strange!

895
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:08,209
The wipers were
functioning just now.

896
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:12,447
It's difficult to drive.
I can't see the road.

897
01:19:13,169 --> 01:19:15,967
The road is clear.
I can see it clearly.

898
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:18,278
You can see?

899
01:19:18,769 --> 01:19:21,124
You drive. I'll give
you the directions.

900
01:19:26,769 --> 01:19:28,043
Why did you hold my hand?

901
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:30,118
You will find out soon.

902
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:52,438
Do you see the bungalow?

903
01:19:54,609 --> 01:19:55,678
Yes.

904
01:19:56,849 --> 01:19:58,043
Do you know this bungalow?

905
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:03,598
I feel as if I have
seen it in my dreams.

906
01:20:04,489 --> 01:20:07,526
Even I have seen it.
But not in my dream.

907
01:20:10,289 --> 01:20:11,358
Come with me.

908
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:21,122
Where are you
taking me? I am scared.

909
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:25,521
I feel, if I go there then
I won't come back again.

910
01:20:26,369 --> 01:20:27,438
Leave me!

911
01:20:28,049 --> 01:20:31,280
What is there to fear?
I am with you.

912
01:20:47,689 --> 01:20:48,838
It is so dark in here.

913
01:20:49,769 --> 01:20:51,209
Extend your hand towards your right.

914
01:20:51,849 --> 01:20:53,760
The candle is kept there. Light it.

915
01:20:54,529 --> 01:20:55,598
Leave my hand.

916
01:21:07,859 --> 01:21:09,527
Today there is no sound.

917
01:21:15,609 --> 01:21:16,678
What sound?

918
01:21:16,843 --> 01:21:18,038
Somebody's wails.

919
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:21,837
Does somebody stay here?

920
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,357
Today, you will come to know.

921
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:31,042
- How?
- You are with me. Come.

922
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:55,283
Why did you stop? Go on walking.

923
01:21:56,769 --> 01:21:58,361
- Which way?
- Upstairs.

924
01:22:18,449 --> 01:22:22,044
Go on walking. No need to fear.

925
01:22:37,129 --> 01:22:42,203
Go straight. Straight.
Toward the last room.

926
01:23:06,129 --> 01:23:07,198
Come with me.

927
01:23:18,209 --> 01:23:19,278
Come.

928
01:23:41,609 --> 01:23:42,678
Open the door.

929
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:45,278
What is in the room?

930
01:23:46,129 --> 01:23:48,359
You will find out
after you open the door.

931
01:23:50,169 --> 01:23:51,363
I am feeling scared.

932
01:23:51,769 --> 01:23:55,125
I should be the one to
feel scared. Open the door.

933
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:04,438
Come.

934
01:24:09,969 --> 01:24:13,848
On such a stormy night..
I too was brought here.

935
01:24:16,769 --> 01:24:19,442
A beautiful girl was
lying dead on this bed.

936
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:24,759
Her face was your mirror image.

937
01:24:26,609 --> 01:24:28,964
Can you tell me? This..

938
01:25:22,529 --> 01:25:23,665
If you had to come
here then what was..

939
01:25:23,689 --> 01:25:25,129
The need to disappear from there?

940
01:25:25,969 --> 01:25:27,038
Why don't you say!

941
01:25:27,769 --> 01:25:29,122
What are you saying, son?

942
01:25:29,689 --> 01:25:31,042
Mother, ask her where she was.

943
01:25:32,834 --> 01:25:34,038
Where she didn't go?

944
01:25:34,769 --> 01:25:36,600
Does it take time
for her to go anywhere?

945
01:25:36,969 --> 01:25:39,039
She was at the hospital,
the isolated place..

946
01:25:39,129 --> 01:25:41,129
Graveyard and that bungalow!
She was everywhere.

947
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,361
How is that possible, son?

948
01:25:44,969 --> 01:25:46,038
You don't know, Mother.

949
01:25:46,529 --> 01:25:49,043
No matter where she is,
her silhouette tails me.

950
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:50,335
She is not your daughter-in-law!

951
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:51,518
She is a mirage! A mirage!

952
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:56,202
She is the light of life
and the shadow of death too.

953
01:25:56,769 --> 01:26:00,967
I have seen her properly
in all her forms. You are..

954
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:02,758
Son!

955
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:06,441
Mother, you wanted a
daughter-in-law, didn't you?

956
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:08,438
You got one.

957
01:26:09,969 --> 01:26:11,197
This is our house.

958
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:15,837
Not the abode of a wandering spirit.

959
01:26:16,049 --> 01:26:17,448
What are you saying, son?

960
01:26:17,529 --> 01:26:18,848
Get this straight, Mother!

961
01:26:19,369 --> 01:26:22,964
If you want me to live, then
get rid of this shadow of death.

962
01:26:23,049 --> 01:26:24,198
Get rid of her!

963
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:30,446
Yes! Yes! I have seen the same face!

964
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:33,363
Are you sure, what you said,
that had happened?

965
01:26:33,449 --> 01:26:35,121
I saw everything with my own eyes.

966
01:26:35,209 --> 01:26:38,963
Wrong! Eyes see what the
mind wants them to see!

967
01:26:39,049 --> 01:26:41,953
But how can the mind conceive
of all the future incidents?

968
01:26:42,033 --> 01:26:44,494
It happens! Mind is very powerful.

969
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:46,202
But this is impossible.

970
01:26:46,569 --> 01:26:49,009
The girl whom I offer a lift in
my car, she is my imagination.

971
01:26:49,049 --> 01:26:50,425
I see the same girl dead in the
bungalow, this..

972
01:26:50,449 --> 01:26:51,449
Too is my imagination.

973
01:26:51,526 --> 01:26:53,025
I run and go back in the
bungalow and don't find anybody..

974
01:26:53,049 --> 01:26:54,249
This too is my imagination.

975
01:26:54,289 --> 01:26:56,678
My wife's face is that
dead girl's mirror image.

976
01:26:56,769 --> 01:26:58,282
Can this too be my imagination?

977
01:27:00,689 --> 01:27:01,758
It is possible.

978
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:07,200
Your imagination saw only one girl.

979
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:10,283
And you saw that girl everywhere.

980
01:27:10,689 --> 01:27:13,442
Her reality is nothing more than
a figment of your imagination.

981
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:14,757
Why don't you believe me?

982
01:27:14,849 --> 01:27:16,025
Because there is a huge difference..

983
01:27:16,049 --> 01:27:17,767
Between truth and illusion.

984
01:27:17,849 --> 01:27:19,025
Is there no difference
between a live woman..

985
01:27:19,049 --> 01:27:20,687
And the picture of imagination?

986
01:27:20,767 --> 01:27:21,829
Yes, there is.

987
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:25,419
But in the trap of your illusion,
you can't see this difference.

988
01:27:34,765 --> 01:27:39,600
Mother, has she left or
she is still in this house?

989
01:27:42,044 --> 01:27:43,724
She is leaving by
tomorrow morning's train.

990
01:28:23,645 --> 01:28:25,875
I am leaving by
tomorrow morning's train.

991
01:28:26,005 --> 01:28:27,074
I heard that.

992
01:28:28,485 --> 01:28:29,964
I didn't want to go..

993
01:28:30,965 --> 01:28:32,921
But I kept quiet thinking..

994
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:37,600
That you would get
some peace if I leave.

995
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:38,819
Who knows?

996
01:28:40,405 --> 01:28:42,635
I am not someone whom
you would remember..

997
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:50,393
But if you do remember me
accidentally, then do forgive me.

998
01:28:53,765 --> 01:28:58,475
When I came to this house you
had Seema's grief in your heart.

999
01:28:59,245 --> 01:29:01,156
There was pain.
There were his memories.

1000
01:29:02,485 --> 01:29:07,240
And now when I am leaving I am
leaving a wound in your heart..

1001
01:29:08,145 --> 01:29:09,478
Which has no remedy.

1002
01:29:11,605 --> 01:29:18,602
Though I am leaving my
heart and soul will be here..

1003
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:23,995
With you. The only thing that
hurts me is that..

1004
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:25,365
You will become lonely again.

1005
01:29:26,405 --> 01:29:28,600
Alone in this big house.

1006
01:29:30,605 --> 01:29:31,925
Why are there tears in your eyes?

1007
01:29:32,965 --> 01:29:34,034
Just like that.

1008
01:29:35,885 --> 01:29:37,682
Fate is cruel.

1009
01:29:38,965 --> 01:29:42,116
The one who should
be laughing is crying.

1010
01:30:02,645 --> 01:30:10,645
"When I narrated my story to you."

1011
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:17,720
"Why did you start crying?"

1012
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:23,880
"When I narrated my story to you."

1013
01:30:24,421 --> 01:30:26,964
"Why did you start crying?"

1014
01:30:27,405 --> 01:30:33,753
"My heart has been ruined."

1015
01:30:33,965 --> 01:30:36,604
"Why did you start crying?"

1016
01:30:49,245 --> 01:30:54,000
"It is my pain and sorrow."

1017
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:58,641
"Why are you enduring it?"

1018
01:30:58,805 --> 01:31:06,805
"Why do you shed it from your eyes?"

1019
01:31:08,645 --> 01:31:14,800
"I have started
the fire of sorrows."

1020
01:31:15,245 --> 01:31:18,043
"Why did you start crying?"

1021
01:31:18,123 --> 01:31:24,320
"When I narrated my story to you."

1022
01:31:24,725 --> 01:31:27,239
"Why did you start crying?"

1023
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:46,685
"I have cried a lot."

1024
01:31:46,765 --> 01:31:53,477
"But now for your sake,
I won't cry."

1025
01:31:53,885 --> 01:31:58,834
"I have lost my solace."

1026
01:31:58,925 --> 01:32:02,884
"But you won't lose yours."

1027
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:09,481
"The doomsday
drowned in your tears."

1028
01:32:09,885 --> 01:32:12,683
"Why did you start crying?"

1029
01:32:12,765 --> 01:32:19,034
"When I narrated my story to you."

1030
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:21,879
"Why did you start crying?"

1031
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:37,595
"If these tears didn't stop..

1032
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:43,362
Then I too will start crying."

1033
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:51,725
"I will drown the moon
and the stars in my tears."

1034
01:32:53,285 --> 01:32:59,474
"The whole
creation will annihilate."

1035
01:32:59,765 --> 01:33:02,598
"Why did you start crying?"

1036
01:33:02,685 --> 01:33:08,681
"When I narrated my story to you."

1037
01:33:09,005 --> 01:33:11,678
"Why did you start crying?"

1038
01:33:11,959 --> 01:33:18,279
"My heart has been ruined."

1039
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:24,995
"Why did you start crying?"

1040
01:34:57,165 --> 01:34:58,837
Watchman! Madhav!

1041
01:35:02,814 --> 01:35:03,814
Who came here just now?

1042
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:05,130
Nobody, sir.

1043
01:35:05,885 --> 01:35:06,954
Did you see anybody here?

1044
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:08,598
- No.
- What rubbish!

1045
01:35:08,846 --> 01:35:09,846
I am telling the truth.

1046
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:11,221
We've been sitting here
for the past half an hour..

1047
01:35:11,245 --> 01:35:12,314
Nobody came.

1048
01:35:13,645 --> 01:35:15,954
- What's the matter, sir?
- Nothing.

1049
01:35:18,424 --> 01:35:21,795
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1050
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:59,478
'I'm leaving. But my heart and
soul will reside here only. '

1051
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:01,233
'With you. '

1052
01:36:03,294 --> 01:36:07,681
'I only regret that you
will again become alone. '

1053
01:37:11,385 --> 01:37:14,038
Anand! Anand, son!

1054
01:37:14,885 --> 01:37:18,116
Anand! Anand! Anand!

1055
01:37:19,045 --> 01:37:20,114
What happened, Mother?

1056
01:37:23,765 --> 01:37:24,834
What's the matter?

1057
01:37:24,914 --> 01:37:27,041
Son, a terrible thing has happened.

1058
01:37:27,485 --> 01:37:28,964
- I have bad news.
- What?

1059
01:37:29,365 --> 01:37:31,081
The train in which
daughter-in-law was travelling..

1060
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:32,405
It has met with an accident.

1061
01:37:32,485 --> 01:37:33,679
- Accident?
- Yes.

1062
01:37:34,048 --> 01:37:36,723
See the paper.
Many people have died.

1063
01:37:36,803 --> 01:37:38,283
What time did the
accident take place?

1064
01:37:38,365 --> 01:37:39,645
At 7 o'clock in the evening.

1065
01:37:39,725 --> 01:37:40,794
Mother, she is not dead!

1066
01:37:41,005 --> 01:37:42,325
I pray for the same.

1067
01:37:42,405 --> 01:37:43,474
She can never die!

1068
01:37:44,485 --> 01:37:45,600
Only living people can die.

1069
01:37:46,205 --> 01:37:48,325
But how can the girl who
dies again and again die?

1070
01:37:48,405 --> 01:37:49,599
What are you saying?

1071
01:37:49,765 --> 01:37:51,881
You won't believe me,
Mother. I am telling the truth.

1072
01:37:52,725 --> 01:37:54,602
The train met with an
accident at 7 o'clock pm.

1073
01:37:55,605 --> 01:37:59,484
I saw her at 2 o'clock in
the night. She was here only.

1074
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,037
You must have dreamt it.

1075
01:38:02,365 --> 01:38:05,038
You saw her in the dream, you
saw her before your dream too.

1076
01:38:05,765 --> 01:38:07,039
She must have survived.

1077
01:38:07,645 --> 01:38:09,601
I pray to God what you say,
that comes true.

1078
01:38:10,776 --> 01:38:11,839
Maybe she survived.

1079
01:38:12,605 --> 01:38:14,402
Son, go. Find out about her.

1080
01:38:15,066 --> 01:38:16,597
It's futile to go, Mother.

1081
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,085
She is there and she is not there.

1082
01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:21,515
She will be found
and she won't be found.

1083
01:38:21,725 --> 01:38:23,477
I can't understand your riddle.

1084
01:38:24,297 --> 01:38:27,289
Have mercy on me.
Find my daughter-in-law.

1085
01:38:28,457 --> 01:38:32,166
Sir, let's go.
We should go and check out

1086
01:38:32,857 --> 01:38:35,246
Son, go. Go.

1087
01:39:00,217 --> 01:39:03,289
Let's go, sir. Now what is here now?

1088
01:39:06,804 --> 01:39:11,971
Doctor, Anand's plight is such
that I can't endure to see it.

1089
01:39:12,051 --> 01:39:14,247
Yes. I understand.

1090
01:39:14,937 --> 01:39:19,169
After Seema, Sandhya's
death came as a shock to him.

1091
01:39:19,464 --> 01:39:21,767
I suggest you to take
him to Shimla immediately.

1092
01:39:21,977 --> 01:39:23,330
My mansion is unoccupied there.

1093
01:39:23,410 --> 01:39:25,215
And you won't have trouble too.

1094
01:39:25,295 --> 01:39:27,248
If you want, you can
take Lata with you.

1095
01:40:02,695 --> 01:40:06,366
Is somebody there?
Is somebody inside?

1096
01:40:06,977 --> 01:40:08,046
Nobody is here.

1097
01:40:08,457 --> 01:40:09,526
Some servant must be here.

1098
01:40:09,777 --> 01:40:12,894
Nobody is there.
This place is so terrifying, ma'am.

1099
01:40:12,974 --> 01:40:14,416
You are scared of everyplace.

1100
01:40:14,496 --> 01:40:15,606
What is there to fear?

1101
01:40:15,686 --> 01:40:17,090
There is nothing to fear, ma'am.

1102
01:40:20,817 --> 01:40:21,886
Did you hear that?

1103
01:40:23,737 --> 01:40:25,375
There is no sound.

1104
01:40:26,457 --> 01:40:28,448
It seems to be an abode of ghosts.

1105
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:30,886
What rubbish! No ghosts dwell here.

1106
01:40:30,966 --> 01:40:32,291
Ghosts are not trustworthy.

1107
01:40:32,371 --> 01:40:35,409
They don't need ticket,
or train or plane.

1108
01:40:35,489 --> 01:40:37,225
And they don't even need
warm clothes for winter.

1109
01:40:37,249 --> 01:40:39,049
Maybe they have arrived before us.

1110
01:40:39,129 --> 01:40:40,129
Shut up! Let's go in!

1111
01:40:40,163 --> 01:40:41,326
- Son, come.
- Let's go.

1112
01:40:41,406 --> 01:40:42,742
Let all troubles vanish.

1113
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:47,093
Let all troubles vanish.

1114
01:40:48,897 --> 01:40:50,615
Sher Singh! Sher Singh!

1115
01:40:50,695 --> 01:40:53,689
Ma'am, listen to me.
Nobody is seen here.

1116
01:40:53,769 --> 01:40:56,179
If we stayed in a hotel, at
least we will see somebody.

1117
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:57,566
Please come.

1118
01:41:04,571 --> 01:41:06,847
They too are going inside.

1119
01:41:07,377 --> 01:41:10,016
Oh, God! Somebody is coming.

1120
01:41:10,617 --> 01:41:11,891
I can't see it.

1121
01:41:13,217 --> 01:41:15,367
- Greetings.
- Ghost.

1122
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:17,037
Who are you?

1123
01:41:17,117 --> 01:41:19,845
I am Sher Singh. The
caretaker of this place.

1124
01:41:19,937 --> 01:41:20,805
The caretaker of this place?

1125
01:41:20,885 --> 01:41:22,313
It means you have
been working here..

1126
01:41:22,337 --> 01:41:23,462
Since the time
this mansion was built?

1127
01:41:23,486 --> 01:41:24,870
I was even born here.

1128
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:28,931
You were born here! Tell me,
is there any ghost here?

1129
01:41:29,177 --> 01:41:32,537
Ghost? Only ghosts dwell here.

1130
01:41:32,617 --> 01:41:33,845
There are all kinds of ghosts.

1131
01:41:34,177 --> 01:41:36,168
- Do you see that tree?
- Yes.

1132
01:41:36,248 --> 01:41:37,525
A spirit dwells there.

1133
01:41:37,777 --> 01:41:39,593
If you go a bit further,
you will find a witch.

1134
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:42,177
- Witch!
- Yes. She sings at 12 o'clock at night.

1135
01:41:42,257 --> 01:41:43,033
She sings at 12 o'clock at night.

1136
01:41:43,113 --> 01:41:45,233
- And at the backyard of this mansion..
- I don't care who is there.

1137
01:41:45,257 --> 01:41:46,666
But I hope nobody is
inside the mansion.

1138
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:49,490
- Inside the mansion..
- Sher Singh! Sher Singh!

1139
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:52,848
- Coming! I will tell you later.
- Fine.

1140
01:41:53,512 --> 01:41:56,415
He is Sher as well as Singh (lion ).
What's the time now?

1141
01:41:56,667 --> 01:41:58,369
She sings at 12 O'clock at night.

1142
01:42:16,457 --> 01:42:20,190
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1143
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:21,985
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1144
01:42:22,065 --> 01:42:23,217
Who are you?

1145
01:42:23,297 --> 01:42:25,470
Forget that! Tell me,
what is your name?

1146
01:42:25,822 --> 01:42:28,047
My name! My name is Sher Singh!

1147
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,957
- What is your name?
- My name is Billi ( cat ) Singh.

1148
01:42:33,037 --> 01:42:35,922
- Billi Singh?
- Yes. - What is that?

1149
01:42:36,002 --> 01:42:39,537
Billi Singh. Here I am.
This is Madhav.

1150
01:42:39,617 --> 01:42:43,451
Oh, God! Madhav, you scared me.

1151
01:42:44,727 --> 01:42:46,608
Tell me. What's the time?

1152
01:42:46,688 --> 01:42:48,783
- Time?
- Yes. - Must be 11 o'clock.

1153
01:42:48,863 --> 01:42:50,046
- 11 o'clock?
- Yes.

1154
01:42:50,126 --> 01:42:52,850
- The clock will strike 12 after an hour.
- Yes, of course..

1155
01:42:52,930 --> 01:42:54,451
- Tell me.
- Yes.

1156
01:42:54,817 --> 01:42:57,536
- At what time does the ghost come out?
- Ghost? -Yes.

1157
01:42:57,617 --> 01:43:00,256
Madhav, do ghosts
have any fixed time?

1158
01:43:00,336 --> 01:43:01,696
They will come whenever they want.

1159
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:03,928
I have heard that
they come at 12 o'clock.

1160
01:43:04,081 --> 01:43:05,291
- 12 o'clock?
- Yes.

1161
01:43:05,515 --> 01:43:07,414
How will I pass this night?

1162
01:43:07,494 --> 01:43:10,256
Madhav, this is a hilly region.

1163
01:43:10,441 --> 01:43:11,731
Nights here are cold.

1164
01:43:11,817 --> 01:43:12,886
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1165
01:43:13,057 --> 01:43:14,743
What time do they sing?

1166
01:43:14,823 --> 01:43:16,872
Between 1 and 3.

1167
01:43:16,952 --> 01:43:18,854
- Between 1 and 3?
- Yes.

1168
01:43:19,097 --> 01:43:23,534
- Do they sing all kinds of songs?
- Yes.

1169
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,369
Nowadays they even sing movie songs.

1170
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:27,613
- They even sing movie songs?
- Yes.

1171
01:43:46,417 --> 01:43:48,612
- Who is she?
- Madhumati.

1172
01:43:48,937 --> 01:43:50,223
- Madhumati?
- Yes.

1173
01:43:50,303 --> 01:43:52,248
- Padmavati's sister?
- No.

1174
01:43:52,457 --> 01:43:55,767
- Sher Singh, you go inside.
- Sher Singh!

1175
01:43:55,847 --> 01:43:58,730
You go inside! And
where should I go?

1176
01:44:52,337 --> 01:44:53,406
Come.

1177
01:44:57,937 --> 01:44:59,609
Son, look who has come.

1178
01:45:08,602 --> 01:45:09,806
Who are you?

1179
01:45:10,577 --> 01:45:12,169
It's good that you have come.

1180
01:45:13,537 --> 01:45:15,607
Now you can't leave this place.

1181
01:45:24,177 --> 01:45:27,613
Mother, who was he?

1182
01:45:28,617 --> 01:45:32,007
Madhav says that he is a
great saint of this place.

1183
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:34,614
But why did he leave like this?

1184
01:45:36,057 --> 01:45:37,888
I feel very strange.

1185
01:45:43,605 --> 01:45:45,534
- What are you writing?
- Nothing! Nothing!

1186
01:45:45,614 --> 01:45:47,334
If it's nothing, then
why are you hiding it?

1187
01:45:47,777 --> 01:45:49,369
I was writing a poem.

1188
01:45:49,617 --> 01:45:52,973
A poem? The way I write lyrics.

1189
01:45:53,737 --> 01:45:56,046
Lyrics, what is that?

1190
01:45:56,126 --> 01:45:59,249
It is what it is.
But what is a poem?

1191
01:46:00,137 --> 01:46:02,177
Poem is what a poet writes.

1192
01:46:02,257 --> 01:46:03,975
Lyric is what a
talented person writes.

1193
01:46:05,017 --> 01:46:06,168
What is that?

1194
01:46:06,248 --> 01:46:10,012
It is what it is.
But what is this poet?

1195
01:46:10,737 --> 01:46:14,920
Poet! The person who writes poems.

1196
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,173
Talented person is the
one who writes lyrics.

1197
01:46:17,744 --> 01:46:19,176
What is that?

1198
01:46:19,345 --> 01:46:22,767
That is what it is.
But what is this poem?

1199
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,049
- What is poem?
- Yes.

1200
01:46:25,318 --> 01:46:26,526
- Shall I tell you?
- Yes.

1201
01:46:29,444 --> 01:46:30,890
- Tell me.
- She has come.

1202
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:32,030
- She has come?
- Yes.

1203
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:35,806
- Tell me.
- The way a cuckoo sings in a garden.

1204
01:46:36,701 --> 01:46:38,416
Lyric goes something like this.

1205
01:46:38,496 --> 01:46:40,767
The way a crow sings on a tree.

1206
01:46:41,399 --> 01:46:42,799
- Shall I explain it to you?
- What?

1207
01:46:42,825 --> 01:46:44,513
- Shall I explain it to you?
- No, I have understood.

1208
01:46:44,537 --> 01:46:45,606
Then give me a cigarette.

1209
01:46:58,415 --> 01:46:59,815
You don't want to come for skating?

1210
01:47:00,298 --> 01:47:01,730
Everybody is waiting downstairs.

1211
01:47:02,217 --> 01:47:03,809
You guys go. I will be there soon.

1212
01:47:04,481 --> 01:47:06,414
- Please.
- Okay.

1213
01:47:43,777 --> 01:47:46,735
- Were you looking out for me?
- Yes.

1214
01:47:47,057 --> 01:47:48,617
Are you searching
for somebody else too?

1215
01:47:49,057 --> 01:47:50,615
Life itself is a search.

1216
01:47:50,891 --> 01:47:53,093
And you have got
lost in that search.

1217
01:47:54,377 --> 01:47:58,290
I know I have lost my way.
I admit that I am searching.

1218
01:47:59,213 --> 01:48:00,709
But I don't know what
I am searching for..

1219
01:48:00,733 --> 01:48:02,530
And for what I
am wandering around.

1220
01:48:02,653 --> 01:48:04,644
- You will find out.
- When?

1221
01:48:04,933 --> 01:48:07,288
- When the time is right.
- When the time is right?

1222
01:48:07,653 --> 01:48:11,646
Yes. And at that time you'll
come to meet me on your own.

1223
01:48:54,253 --> 01:48:58,371
"The lightening of the sly eyes."

1224
01:48:58,973 --> 01:49:03,633
"Strike it in my heart."

1225
01:49:03,713 --> 01:49:07,692
"Don't worry about me."

1226
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:12,843
"You just keep smiling."

1227
01:49:12,923 --> 01:49:17,444
"The lightening of the sly eyes."

1228
01:49:35,533 --> 01:49:39,492
"The desires have aroused."

1229
01:49:40,093 --> 01:49:43,881
"Glimmering in the heart."

1230
01:49:44,653 --> 01:49:48,692
"On the path of faithfulness."

1231
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:53,006
"I have started
walking along with you."

1232
01:49:53,813 --> 01:49:57,647
"If you want, you
can make me laugh."

1233
01:49:58,413 --> 01:50:03,009
"If you want, you can make me cry."

1234
01:50:03,089 --> 01:50:07,092
"The lightening of the sly eyes."

1235
01:50:07,653 --> 01:50:12,249
"Strike it in my heart."

1236
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:16,963
"The lightening of the sly eyes."

1237
01:50:44,413 --> 01:50:48,201
"The destination of
love is far away."

1238
01:50:48,893 --> 01:50:52,772
"It is very far away."

1239
01:50:53,533 --> 01:50:57,526
"Come and hold my hands."

1240
01:50:58,093 --> 01:51:01,972
"The soul is not far away."

1241
01:51:02,773 --> 01:51:07,051
"Leaving your world."

1242
01:51:07,413 --> 01:51:11,929
"Enter my world."

1243
01:51:12,053 --> 01:51:16,092
"The lightening of the sly eyes."

1244
01:51:16,653 --> 01:51:21,204
"Strike it in my heart."

1245
01:51:21,293 --> 01:51:25,889
"The lightening of the sly eyes."

1246
01:52:40,533 --> 01:52:41,648
What's the matter, Anand?

1247
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:49,206
What's the matter, Anand?

1248
01:52:49,893 --> 01:52:51,087
I saw her again.

1249
01:52:52,018 --> 01:52:53,964
Whom? Whom, Anand?

1250
01:52:57,794 --> 01:52:58,962
Nobody.

1251
01:53:07,093 --> 01:53:10,927
'Daddy, I think it is
deeply affecting his mind. '

1252
01:53:11,693 --> 01:53:13,763
'He had seen somebody. '

1253
01:53:14,533 --> 01:53:16,410
'But when I asked him, he refused. '

1254
01:53:17,253 --> 01:53:18,925
'Now it could prove
even more dangerous.'

1255
01:53:44,213 --> 01:53:46,329
Your time has arrived.

1256
01:53:47,311 --> 01:53:49,522
Good that you have come.

1257
01:53:59,213 --> 01:54:00,282
March ahead.

1258
01:54:04,081 --> 01:54:06,208
This is the end of your journey.

1259
01:54:16,118 --> 01:54:18,647
- Do you see anything?
- Nothing.

1260
01:54:18,733 --> 01:54:20,963
You won't see
anything with these eyes.

1261
01:54:22,493 --> 01:54:26,532
Soul is craving for
the soul. Not your body.

1262
01:54:27,093 --> 01:54:31,291
If you want to see her, then
let go of your physical body.

1263
01:54:32,413 --> 01:54:35,166
The soul that has been
waiting for you for 100 years..

1264
01:54:35,973 --> 01:54:38,328
Do you want to see
her with these eyes?

1265
01:54:39,733 --> 01:54:40,802
100 years?

1266
01:54:40,882 --> 01:54:44,926
Yes. Try to remember. 100 years ago.

1267
01:54:45,453 --> 01:54:47,523
She had slipped at this place.

1268
01:54:48,253 --> 01:54:49,971
You left her and went away.

1269
01:54:51,213 --> 01:54:54,205
Her soul is still wandering for you.

1270
01:54:55,213 --> 01:54:56,771
And it will continue to wander.

1271
01:54:57,533 --> 01:54:59,649
Till the time you both unite.

1272
01:55:00,853 --> 01:55:02,286
Now don't think anything.

1273
01:55:03,533 --> 01:55:07,412
Look. Covered in that
white silky sheet of snow..

1274
01:55:08,053 --> 01:55:10,328
So silently she is
calling out to you.

1275
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:16,771
Just one jump of yours and everybody
will reach their destination.

1276
01:55:16,851 --> 01:55:21,284
Just one jump. You will meet her.

1277
01:55:22,653 --> 01:55:24,086
Her soul.

1278
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,766
Look.

1279
01:56:03,533 --> 01:56:10,219
"Eyes are brimming...

1280
01:56:10,809 --> 01:56:17,321
with tears."

1281
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:37,853
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1282
01:56:37,933 --> 01:56:45,442
"Beloved, I am
waiting for you to come."

1283
01:56:45,533 --> 01:56:52,644
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1284
01:56:53,176 --> 01:56:56,642
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1285
01:56:57,253 --> 01:56:58,686
"It is brimming with tears."

1286
01:56:59,133 --> 01:57:00,646
"It is brimming with tears."

1287
01:57:13,853 --> 01:57:17,528
"Those days dwell in my eyes."

1288
01:57:17,693 --> 01:57:21,288
"Those memories reside in my sighs."

1289
01:57:24,893 --> 01:57:28,363
"Those days dwell in my eyes."

1290
01:57:28,453 --> 01:57:31,650
"Those memories reside in my sighs."

1291
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:35,163
"That soul still wanders."

1292
01:57:35,533 --> 01:57:40,243
"On the path of love."

1293
01:57:40,323 --> 01:57:46,847
"Lonely paths, fervent arms."

1294
01:57:47,651 --> 01:57:54,923
"The craving of ages
dwells in the eyes."

1295
01:57:55,093 --> 01:58:01,965
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1296
01:58:02,453 --> 01:58:06,162
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1297
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:08,085
"It is brimming with tears."

1298
01:58:08,333 --> 01:58:10,085
"It is brimming with tears."

1299
01:58:23,253 --> 01:58:26,928
"My eyes fidget without you."

1300
01:58:27,008 --> 01:58:30,529
"Love can't do anything."

1301
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:37,928
"My eyes fidget without you."

1302
01:58:38,008 --> 01:58:41,523
"Love can't do anything."

1303
01:58:41,733 --> 01:58:45,248
"Come to me, my beloved."

1304
01:58:45,453 --> 01:58:50,083
"The lamp of
faithfulness is burning."

1305
01:58:50,163 --> 01:58:53,012
"My life companion."

1306
01:58:53,813 --> 01:58:56,691
"Again I am restless."

1307
01:58:57,413 --> 01:59:04,171
"Wherever you are, come to me."

1308
01:59:04,251 --> 01:59:11,165
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1309
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:15,129
"Eyes are brimming with tears."

1310
01:59:15,653 --> 01:59:17,052
"It is brimming with tears."

1311
01:59:17,132 --> 01:59:19,528
"It is brimming with tears."

1312
01:59:27,007 --> 01:59:29,129
Anand!

1313
01:59:30,757 --> 01:59:32,690
Anand!

1314
01:59:32,957 --> 01:59:34,651
Anand!

1315
01:59:39,813 --> 01:59:45,171
Anand! Anand! Anand!

1316
02:00:05,253 --> 02:00:06,527
You are perfectly fine.

1317
02:00:09,373 --> 02:00:12,365
Anand, you have been a fine doctor.

1318
02:00:13,013 --> 02:00:15,481
Now be a good patient.

1319
02:00:16,853 --> 02:00:21,085
Who was she? What was she?
Forget it completely.

1320
02:00:23,413 --> 02:00:27,372
Now you need to rest just
for a week. Complete rest.

1321
02:00:27,813 --> 02:00:29,531
You are even
forbidden from thinking.

1322
02:00:31,693 --> 02:00:33,524
Anand.. remember.

1323
02:00:33,853 --> 02:00:36,083
If you didn't
control your thoughts..

1324
02:00:36,973 --> 02:00:38,933
Then you are a doctor,
you yourself can think..

1325
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,293
What the outcome will be.

1326
02:00:42,333 --> 02:00:43,402
Good.

1327
02:00:43,973 --> 02:00:45,804
- Thank you, sir.
- Lata.

1328
02:00:52,133 --> 02:00:55,523
Don't leave him
alone even for a minute.

1329
02:01:54,453 --> 02:01:55,522
Lata!

1330
02:01:56,868 --> 02:01:58,884
- What's the matter?
- Call, Mr. Singh immediately.

1331
02:01:59,093 --> 02:02:00,093
What happened?

1332
02:02:00,156 --> 02:02:01,916
- Mr. Singh. Quickly.
- I'll go and call him.

1333
02:02:24,773 --> 02:02:26,126
Daddy, he is gone!

1334
02:03:37,871 --> 02:03:39,207
Come inside.

1335
02:03:40,933 --> 02:03:42,207
The bungalow.

1336
02:03:43,813 --> 02:03:45,087
The bungalow.

1337
02:06:02,913 --> 02:06:04,869
Anand, I am here.

1338
02:07:54,593 --> 02:07:55,662
Why did you stop?

1339
02:07:59,953 --> 02:08:02,865
I had to bring you only till here.

1340
02:08:03,913 --> 02:08:05,273
Even I had to come only till here.

1341
02:08:06,473 --> 02:08:09,783
So that I find out as to
who are you? What are you?

1342
02:08:10,993 --> 02:08:12,267
You have still not understood?

1343
02:08:12,513 --> 02:08:15,391
No, but today I will understand.

1344
02:08:17,033 --> 02:08:18,671
Today, you are under my control.

1345
02:08:21,433 --> 02:08:23,663
I was under your control since ages.

1346
02:08:25,033 --> 02:08:26,591
You only stayed away from me.

1347
02:08:27,633 --> 02:08:32,388
I always moved towards you,
trying to lure you.

1348
02:08:34,153 --> 02:08:36,144
The result was that the distance..

1349
02:08:36,233 --> 02:08:38,508
Between life and death increased.

1350
02:08:40,913 --> 02:08:43,871
Distance! Today that
distance will be bridged!

1351
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:49,902
Now there is only a veil between
us that is hiding the truth.

1352
02:08:50,593 --> 02:08:51,821
And you are that veil.

1353
02:08:52,273 --> 02:08:54,273
It's you! It's you! It's you!

1354
02:08:54,353 --> 02:08:56,150
Today that life
will come to an end..

1355
02:08:56,233 --> 02:08:58,224
Which entangled me
in the guise of death.

1356
02:08:59,553 --> 02:09:01,305
You can't kill me.

1357
02:09:02,233 --> 02:09:05,350
Only living people can die.

1358
02:09:22,273 --> 02:09:27,142
Listen to me. Come with me.

1359
02:09:28,513 --> 02:09:34,190
In such a world, where
there is no sorrow, no joy..

1360
02:09:36,233 --> 02:09:40,431
No tears, no smile.

1361
02:09:42,713 --> 02:09:45,147
Stop! Stop! Wait!
Don't go after her!

1362
02:09:45,354 --> 02:09:47,389
I am Sandhya! I am your Sandhya!

1363
02:09:47,473 --> 02:09:49,229
She is a mirage! She is..

1364
02:09:58,433 --> 02:10:03,666
Who was she? She was you!

1365
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:08,668
With the charade of being a soul,
you always confused me.

1366
02:10:09,193 --> 02:10:10,652
You were that person!

1367
02:10:11,465 --> 02:10:13,945
You met me in the isolated place
and vanished in the graveyard.

1368
02:10:14,713 --> 02:10:17,169
You were the one who was
lying dead in this house.

1369
02:10:17,673 --> 02:10:19,311
When I returned,
you had disappeared.

1370
02:10:19,833 --> 02:10:20,902
You were that person!

1371
02:10:21,375 --> 02:10:22,849
You brought me from the
hospital to this place..

1372
02:10:22,873 --> 02:10:23,993
And then you disappeared.

1373
02:10:26,033 --> 02:10:27,148
You were that person!

1374
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:29,902
Why are you getting scared?

1375
02:10:30,193 --> 02:10:31,387
I won't say anything to you.

1376
02:10:32,313 --> 02:10:34,383
The living person is the problem.

1377
02:10:34,633 --> 02:10:35,782
You did all this!

1378
02:10:36,833 --> 02:10:38,391
But I ask you, why you did it?

1379
02:10:39,233 --> 02:10:40,746
Why did you do it? Why?

1380
02:10:50,153 --> 02:10:51,222
Ramesh, you?

1381
02:10:51,393 --> 02:10:53,509
Yes. It's me.

1382
02:10:54,153 --> 02:10:55,666
You did all this?!

1383
02:10:56,033 --> 02:10:59,025
Yes! I did it.

1384
02:10:59,433 --> 02:11:02,869
But why? Why did you do it, Ramesh?

1385
02:11:03,313 --> 02:11:07,306
For Lala Jagat Narayan's wealth.
You inherit it!

1386
02:11:08,193 --> 02:11:09,751
Do you remember the condition?

1387
02:11:10,393 --> 02:11:15,023
If you go mad, then some other
heir will inherit that wealth.

1388
02:11:15,633 --> 02:11:18,431
And I was that other heir.

1389
02:11:19,473 --> 02:11:20,542
Listen!

1390
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:24,585
Before dying,
listen to me carefully!

1391
02:11:25,193 --> 02:11:27,832
Your mother wanted to
get you married to Sandhya.

1392
02:11:27,953 --> 02:11:29,033
And I also wanted the same.

1393
02:11:29,793 --> 02:11:32,432
Because Sandhya's twin
sister was my hostage.

1394
02:11:32,633 --> 02:11:34,305
And even Sandhya
didn't know about it.

1395
02:11:35,033 --> 02:11:37,945
The means to make you mad.

1396
02:11:38,593 --> 02:11:42,142
But you.. you wanted to marry Seema.

1397
02:11:42,473 --> 02:11:45,033
So I killed her too.

1398
02:11:45,193 --> 02:11:46,262
Sandhya!

1399
02:12:56,045 --> 02:12:57,222
Anand!

1400
02:14:15,226 --> 02:14:17,573
Stop! Otherwise I will shoot.

1401
02:14:27,503 --> 02:14:28,572
Anand!

1402
02:14:43,823 --> 02:14:44,892
Madhav!

1403
02:14:47,183 --> 02:14:48,855
From the street to the house.

1404
02:14:50,503 --> 02:14:54,052
And from the house to
the big house. Come on!

1405
02:14:58,703 --> 02:14:59,772
Move!

1406
02:15:04,983 --> 02:15:06,132
Mr. Ramesh!

1407
02:15:07,503 --> 02:15:10,734
I arrest you for
the murder of Seema.

1408
02:15:24,863 --> 02:15:28,742
Today she has died.
She has really died.

1409
02:15:30,053 --> 02:15:31,575
I regret her death.

1410
02:15:33,453 --> 02:15:38,732
But this poor girl had become a
puppet in wicked Ramesh's hands.

1411
02:15:41,303 --> 02:15:43,737
We found out about this
secret from Ramesh's diary.

1412
02:15:44,423 --> 02:15:47,495
18 years ago, Sandhya's
parents had a quarrel.

1413
02:15:48,503 --> 02:15:50,024
The matter became so serious that..

1414
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:52,934
They both separated forever.

1415
02:15:53,503 --> 02:15:55,300
Mother took this girl with her.

1416
02:15:56,103 --> 02:15:57,855
Father kept Sandhya with her.

1417
02:15:58,316 --> 02:16:00,492
And he told her that
her mother is dead.

1418
02:16:01,583 --> 02:16:05,576
Mother died leaving this
girl at the mercy of the world.

1419
02:16:06,423 --> 02:16:07,822
This girl went missing.

1420
02:16:08,743 --> 02:16:10,973
And 16 years later, when
the father found her..

1421
02:16:11,943 --> 02:16:13,503
She had already
become characterless.

1422
02:16:14,103 --> 02:16:16,412
Father.. out of shame
didn't say anything to Sandhya.

1423
02:16:16,903 --> 02:16:19,900
Ramesh taught this girl
all of Sandhya's habits.

1424
02:16:20,903 --> 02:16:27,217
Her art.. her painting..
Even her song.

1425
02:16:28,383 --> 02:16:31,022
Eyes are brimming with tears.

1426
02:16:32,214 --> 02:16:35,334
And then he sent her to
meet Anand in a stormy night.

1427
02:16:37,583 --> 02:16:40,051
The door didn't open on
its own in the graveyard.

1428
02:16:40,143 --> 02:16:41,451
In fact somebody opened it.

1429
02:16:46,942 --> 02:16:48,261
This was the first incident.

1430
02:16:49,063 --> 02:16:50,758
The second time Anand was
called in this bungalow..

1431
02:16:50,782 --> 02:16:52,773
And shown the same girl as dead.

1432
02:16:53,383 --> 02:16:55,557
And all this was done,
so that the fear..

1433
02:16:56,428 --> 02:16:59,900
Of ghost always grips your mind.

1434
02:17:00,183 --> 02:17:01,502
But that inspector, the police..

1435
02:17:01,583 --> 02:17:03,062
All of that was just a charade.

1436
02:17:03,583 --> 02:17:06,461
They were Ramesh's men and
all of them are present here.

1437
02:17:11,143 --> 02:17:14,499
When you entered the room
again with these bogus policemen..

1438
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,535
The room was rearranged.

1439
02:17:17,583 --> 02:17:19,583
Ramesh, like a malicious man,
weaved the mesh..

1440
02:17:19,663 --> 02:17:21,011
Of his conspiracy all around.

1441
02:17:21,683 --> 02:17:24,800
And he sent Madhav as a
servant to Anand's house.

1442
02:17:25,602 --> 02:17:27,593
So that Ramesh is
informed about everything.

1443
02:17:28,932 --> 02:17:30,760
Madhav saw Sandhya's clothes.

1444
02:17:31,728 --> 02:17:34,401
And Ramesh bought the same
clothes from the market.

1445
02:17:35,125 --> 02:17:37,603
So that when the need
arises some other girl..

1446
02:17:37,683 --> 02:17:39,123
Can take up the guise of Sandhya.

1447
02:17:39,893 --> 02:17:42,915
That other girl came to
the hospital as Sandhya.

1448
02:17:43,905 --> 02:17:45,601
And after taking
Anand to the bungalow..

1449
02:17:45,683 --> 02:17:46,877
She herself disappeared.

1450
02:17:47,683 --> 02:17:49,196
But that song in the boat?

1451
02:17:49,883 --> 02:17:51,157
That was just a tape recorder.

1452
02:17:52,483 --> 02:17:55,361
When you reached your house,
the door was locked.

1453
02:17:56,323 --> 02:17:58,473
Inside the twin girl was
singing that same song.

1454
02:18:01,003 --> 02:18:02,482
You searched everywhere.

1455
02:18:02,723 --> 02:18:03,792
You didn't find anybody.

1456
02:18:04,906 --> 02:18:07,117
But when you opened
your house's door..

1457
02:18:07,764 --> 02:18:10,002
You saw your wife in front of you.

1458
02:18:10,083 --> 02:18:12,472
Superintendent, what
about that train accident?

1459
02:18:12,963 --> 02:18:15,602
Dr. Singh, that
accident really happened.

1460
02:18:16,602 --> 02:18:19,116
But Sandhya was abducted
before the accident occurred.

1461
02:18:20,003 --> 02:18:22,801
When you took Dr. Anand to Shimla..

1462
02:18:23,243 --> 02:18:25,598
Ramesh imprisoned her twin sister..

1463
02:18:25,683 --> 02:18:27,401
And sent her
twin sister to Shimla.

1464
02:18:28,087 --> 02:18:30,034
So that Dr. Anand sees her.

1465
02:18:30,683 --> 02:18:33,595
And believes that his wife
who died in the accident..

1466
02:18:33,674 --> 02:18:35,638
Has come in front of
him as a wandering soul.

1467
02:18:38,163 --> 02:18:40,040
Sandhya will tell you the rest.

1468
02:18:42,723 --> 02:18:45,317
After abducting me from the train,
I was imprisoned here.

1469
02:18:46,607 --> 02:18:48,833
Here, I came to
know about everything.

1470
02:18:50,282 --> 02:18:52,591
That how they were
trying to make you go mad.

1471
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:56,755
I met her too. She
was very merciless.

1472
02:18:57,602 --> 02:18:59,433
She brought you here
from the hospital.

1473
02:19:00,483 --> 02:19:02,360
Sometimes I was
hidden and she was shown.

1474
02:19:03,003 --> 02:19:04,914
Sometimes she was
hidden and I was shown.

1475
02:19:06,602 --> 02:19:08,194
I couldn't do anything.

1476
02:19:08,767 --> 02:19:11,322
Because they threatened to kill you.

1477
02:19:12,323 --> 02:19:13,961
Somehow I escaped from there.

1478
02:19:14,483 --> 02:19:15,923
I went upstairs and I saw you there.

1479
02:19:16,245 --> 02:19:17,397
And I screamed.

1480
02:19:18,683 --> 02:19:19,752
Leave me!
