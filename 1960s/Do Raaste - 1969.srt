00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:19,076
Prince College Hostel, London.

4
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:22,548
Respected brother,
you will be glad to know that..

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:26,359
I have passed the final
year of engineering with 1st rank.

6
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:31,916
I think this is the result
of the blessings of you all..

7
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,541
More than my own hard work.

8
00:00:34,148 --> 00:00:35,751
I am thousands of miles far from you.

9
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,035
But you all are in front of my eyes.

10
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,097
You must be sitting
on your bed in your room.

11
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:43,977
Mother must be sitting opposite you.

12
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,233
A young girl must be sitting in her lap..

13
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:48,700
Whose teeth are cut off by rats.

14
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:53,679
Hey! How did uncle know that
the rats have cut off my teeth?

15
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,648
And there must be a
monkey sitting beside you..

16
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,432
Trying to read the
letter and whose name is..

17
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:03,473
Raju!

18
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:08,041
Directly behind mother
would be standing Geeta..

19
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,896
And whose hands would
be stained with ink.

20
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,047
Wow!

21
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,734
And near you would be standing Bhabhi..

22
00:01:16,848 --> 00:01:18,488
Her hands soiled with flour.

23
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:24,972
I've been dying to
eat the food cooked by her.

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,954
Satyen must be sitting in
his same old place and reading.

25
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,205
Seeing all of Mumbai
from there sometimes..

26
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,365
He must be getting
back to his reading.

27
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,516
I don't worry about Satyen.

28
00:01:37,422 --> 00:01:40,450
There's one more person
who would be standing..

29
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:43,014
Behind the window and listening
to this letter carefully.

30
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:46,713
My dear pal, how did Viju know that..

31
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:49,171
I listen to his letter
from outside the window?

32
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:51,756
I swear on God, he is a magician!

33
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:53,421
What do I write about you?

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,746
You are not only my brother
but also my father, my god.

35
00:01:58,637 --> 00:01:59,893
You've done a lot for me.

36
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,115
I don't know how would
I repay your favors.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,637
Whatever I am today is because of you.

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,010
Silly boy!

39
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Father,

40
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,183
to fulfill the promise I made to you..

41
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:29,555
I tried to do whatever I could.

42
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:34,245
And I will do whatever I can in future.

43
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:37,663
The only thing I regret is..

44
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:44,260
That you are not
with us to share this joy.

45
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:49,169
Child, your mother
died when you were young.

46
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:56,252
After that I could not give
you enough love like other fathers.

47
00:02:56,277 --> 00:03:00,263
Don't say that, father.
You've given me a lot.

48
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,047
Given you what?

49
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:07,466
A stepmother, two stepbrothers?

50
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:10,336
And a stepsister?

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,744
Father..

52
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:21,369
I swear that I will
love them all like my own ones.

53
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,371
Always.

54
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,985
God bless you, Narendu.

55
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,614
May everyone have a son like you!

56
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:30,863
Father..

57
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:41,593
May God give me the strength
to carry my vow till I die!

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,597
Greetings, Bhabhi.

59
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:36,758
Welcome, brother Khan.

60
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,771
Since the day you've received the news..

61
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,047
That Viju has passed,
you all have stopped doing any work.

62
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:43,574
You listen to old songs,
and dream new dreams?

63
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,325
Yes, Khan,

64
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,670
this song contains
the dreams of my father.

65
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:54,947
And it seems that
they'll soon be realized.

66
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,561
Why not, brother Narendu?

67
00:04:56,848 --> 00:05:00,299
You work hard all day,
then also work at night.

68
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:03,995
- When Viju comes, you will be able to rest.
- Of course.

69
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,157
Mother won't sew clothes.

70
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,591
Bhabhi won't work in the kitchen.

71
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,627
There will be servants for every task.

72
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:13,932
- And I? I will close my garage and rest.
- Yes!

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,340
Greetings, everyone.
Congratulations, Narendu.

74
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:22,130
Very glad to know about Viju.

75
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,646
Lalaji, we are happy because
our brother is coming back.

76
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,322
But you are happy because..

77
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:31,020
You will be getting your
loan and interest both back.

78
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:34,341
I am glad that..

79
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:38,139
One brother mortgaged
the house and took loan from me..

80
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:41,684
While other brother
is coming to repay that debt.

81
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,232
Lalaji, you will do good business..

82
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:48,598
Because the third brother
is also ready to go abroad.

83
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,324
Come, brother Satyen. Take a
chit and decide the fate of your pal.

84
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,878
- What is this?
- You have a bad habit.

85
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:57,495
- You ask questions on every matter.
- Ok, I won't ask, but what is this?

86
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,658
- Ok, take out a chit first.
- Take one! Take one!

87
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,811
Hurry! Hurry!

88
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:09,223
Birbal!

89
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,054
- Hey! What happened?
- Get some water?

90
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:15,015
What happened to him?

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,679
It's true.
This had to happen one day.

92
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:20,459
He is the eighth fool to be sacrificed.

93
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:22,968
He has seen seven fools
being sacrificed before him.

94
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,152
But what is all this about?

95
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,941
A new problem has come
up in the college, a girl.

96
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:29,578
Not a girl; a calamity!

97
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:32,530
Not a calamity, a bomb!

98
00:06:32,555 --> 00:06:34,096
Who is she after all?

99
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:55,947
Why do you go from this long cut?
Go from there, pal.

100
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,319
Good luck, Birbal. O Allah!

101
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:05,720
Be careful.

102
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,188
My dear, would you
come for a movie with me?

103
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,787
Strange! A student of the first year,
and so daring?

104
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:19,521
If you have the guts,
go and break off her boldness.

105
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,700
I will write your name as the 9th fool.

106
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,506
- Kid!
- Yes, pal.

107
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,603
If I don't convince this girl..

108
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:29,095
In the next 24 hours,
I will change my name.

109
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:43,220
That boy.. he's taken a challenge.

110
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,466
- Challenge? What challenge?
- To teach you a lesson.

111
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:49,214
But how do you know that?

112
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,814
His friend is also my friend.

113
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:58,737
When I tell him,
Rustom, you are so nice..

114
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,370
He speaks out everything.

115
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:04,800
- I see. What is the name of that mister?
- Satyen Prasad Gupta.

116
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,238
How does he look?

117
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,138
Shaves his face once a week..

118
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:11,347
And changes clothes
every four days.

119
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,488
Dirty fellow! Where does he live?

120
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:18,417
From 9:30 to 2:00
in the lecture room.

121
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:21,605
From 2:00 to 6:00 in the library.

122
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:25,082
And from 6:00 to 6:30 in
the common room. Then I don't know.

123
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:28,558
- That means he's a book worm. Loves books.
- Correct.

124
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:31,605
Ok.. is he fat or slim.

125
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,535
Medium.

126
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,996
- Is he tall or short?
- Medium.

127
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:44,733
He is not what he looks;
he's very smart.

128
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:48,757
Be careful;
such men are really dangerous.

129
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:51,246
Don't you worry! Let the kid come.

130
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,866
Ms. Rina,
no dictionary in this world..

131
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,499
Has enough words
to describe your beauty.

132
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,160
This juicy eyes,
these pink cheeks, this silky hair..

133
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:08,988
- Keep it up, pal. Keep it up.
- Yes, carry on.

134
00:09:09,403 --> 00:09:11,464
Carry on? These yellow eyes,
these swollen cheeks..

135
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,053
These black lips,
this big, fat tummy.

136
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,374
Seeing this I am forgetting the formula.

137
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:17,463
- Forget him; tell us the formula.
- Formula is very simple.

138
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:18,848
Tell us fast, buddy.

139
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,369
- Make friends with the girl.
- Then?

140
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,351
- Praise the girl.
- What then?

141
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,641
- Tell her that you've never seen such pretty eyes.
- And then?

142
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:30,396
- Then the girl will lower her eyes and feel shy.
- Feel shy!

143
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,303
- Wonderful!
- What then?

144
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,277
Then praise her more. Tell
her that your lips are like roses.

145
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:43,265
- These lips.. these lips..
- Speak ahead!

146
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:47,303
- What will the girl do then?
- Then.. Then the girl will fall in love.

147
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,571
- How come?
- Simple.

148
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,130
A pretty girl is always
in love with herself.

149
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,987
When a guy praises her the right way..

150
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,071
She falls in love with him.

151
00:09:59,922 --> 00:10:02,154
Ok, you guys arrange a nice picnic.

152
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,309
Then see what your pal does.

153
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:40,567
'This silky hair, these pretty eyes.'

154
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:47,552
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

155
00:10:48,136 --> 00:10:54,294
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

156
00:10:54,943 --> 00:11:01,313
'This silky hair, these pretty eyes.'

157
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:08,020
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

158
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:14,626
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

159
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:45,529
'If these eyes lower
down with shyness..'

160
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:52,098
'If these eyes lower
down with shyness..'

161
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:59,596
'The whole matter
would be stopped here.'

162
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:06,573
'Keep quiet and don't
tell them that..'

163
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:13,039
'Everyone drinks by seeing them.'

164
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:19,752
'Everyone drinks by seeing them.'

165
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:26,727
'This silky hair, these pretty eyes.'

166
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:33,274
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

167
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:39,584
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

168
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:13,879
'The hair would bring
so much arrogance..'

169
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:20,536
'The hair would bring
so much arrogance..'

170
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:27,610
'It will make my heart
and soul restless.'

171
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:34,742
'Don't tell them that
they drive us crazy.'

172
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:41,176
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

173
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:47,056
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

174
00:13:48,352 --> 00:13:54,543
'This silky hair, these pretty eyes.'

175
00:13:54,907 --> 00:14:01,037
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

176
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:07,249
'Everyone lives by seeing them.'

177
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:14,555
Ms. Rina,
can I also live praising your hair?

178
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:19,620
You.. you've voiced my feelings.

179
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:26,979
Can I.. how can I say this..
That you're.. you're very nice.

180
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,043
This mere human is your servant.

181
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:34,106
Ask my heart,
look at yourself with my eyes..

182
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,401
Enough, Rina!
I can't bear it any more.

183
00:14:41,367 --> 00:14:42,578
What happened, Rina?

184
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,022
- I am also surprised.
- Are you?

185
00:14:46,683 --> 00:14:48,842
- When will you meet me?
- Whenever you say.

186
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,819
- Where?
- Wherever you say.

187
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,407
By the way, I go for swimming everyday.

188
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,256
Really? Shall I come there today?

189
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:01,222
- Yes.. no, come tomorrow.
- Ok.

190
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,061
Excuse me;
can you tell me where is Ms. Rina?

191
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:21,271
She's in the office.

192
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,640
I mean.. I was..

193
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,214
- Shut up, all of you!
- Get him out right now.

194
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:05,864
Go in, all of you. Go in.

195
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,270
Hey mister, where are you going again?

196
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:15,413
Well, actually when I came here..

197
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:16,923
There was a board reading 'office'.

198
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,474
I am telling the truth;
I am not lying.

199
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,704
So is it me who's lying,
and you're telling the truth?

200
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,286
- Wicked!
- Wicked? Do I look like a wicked person? Do I?

201
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,120
No, dear, you look very decent.

202
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,128
That's why you were looking at the girls.

203
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:31,959
I say, you can't leave from here.

204
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,112
I will smash you,
make kohl of your bones..

205
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:36,456
And put it in my eyes.

206
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,709
Gone! Gone!

207
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:47,219
I say.. I say, leave him.
He will die.

208
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,888
The police will arrest me.

209
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:55,928
He's come out.
Leave him, girls. I will come in.

210
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,025
Help! Help!

211
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:01,743
I don't know how to swim.
The police will arrest me.

212
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,045
Help! Help!

213
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,156
Someone come and help, please.

214
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,345
Help...

215
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,593
See? Formula number one is drowned.

216
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:17,772
Formula number one did not work.

217
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:20,492
See what formula number
two does tomorrow.

218
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,204
Tomorrow?

219
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,065
Don't you see while you're riding?

220
00:17:47,739 --> 00:17:49,758
That's what I want to ask.

221
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:54,038
You have such big eyes!
Can't you see while you're walking?

222
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,958
Whose thoughts were you lost in?
Dilip Kumar or Dev Anand?

223
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:00,038
Get lost!

224
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,878
I will go with you now.
There's a good hotel nearby.

225
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,583
And they also serve beer.

226
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
You idiot!

227
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:23,907
Look, mister, to talk to
girls like this is.. unmannerly!

228
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,783
Sorry, sir.
Sorry, sir. Very sorry. Sorry..

229
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,959
- No, sir.. I made a mistake.. Please, no.
- Speak.

230
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:14,124
Forgive me, you were bothered..

231
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:45,092
I swear on God, I had never dreamt that..

232
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:50,088
A bomb would burst
out by helping someone.

233
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,628
Pal, that is not his fault.

234
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,976
That girl is not a girl;
she is a powerhouse.

235
00:19:57,226 --> 00:19:59,545
If you touch her,
she gives out an electric current.

236
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,285
Girls and boys, let me first tell you..

237
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:11,805
That theorems and problems
are just like a married couple.

238
00:20:12,531 --> 00:20:14,898
I mean the husband and the wife.

239
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:20,377
If you can win over the wife,
husband is already conquered.

240
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,620
So if you can master the theorems..

241
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,206
Problems are no more problems.

242
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:27,812
Problems are already solved.

243
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:31,585
The first theorem in trigonometry is..

244
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:57,170
Can anyone of you solve it?

245
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:00,661
Ms. Rina?

246
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,031
- I'll try, sir.
- Come.

247
00:21:07,206 --> 00:21:08,206
Silence!

248
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:16,480
My dears, if it is a good joke,
tell us. We will also laugh.

249
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:20,489
Silence!

250
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,657
You can't help laughing.

251
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:30,629
Come here.

252
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,791
Come here.

253
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,826
What happened?
Come; solve this problem.

254
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,154
- First move her aside.
- Why?

255
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,670
Yes, sir, move her.
I am the only child of my parents.

256
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,052
What if I get an electric shock?

257
00:21:59,396 --> 00:22:03,334
Silence! What bluntness is this?

258
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:07,345
Sir, it's not my fault.
She herself has put such a board.

259
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:08,794
See it for yourself, sir.

260
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:12,888
You idiot!

261
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:19,234
Silence! Silence!

262
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:22,459
Silence!

263
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:26,421
- Sir is also laughing.
- Silence!

264
00:22:28,813 --> 00:22:30,437
Sir is also laughing.

265
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,344
This doll is for Guddi.

266
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,583
Now it's Satyen's turn after Guddi.
Here's a cardigan for you.

267
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:14,198
I got it from Wallstreet, London.

268
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:17,510
Wow! From the Wallstreet, London?

269
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:20,373
It will prove handy to
impress the college girls.

270
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,582
Thank you, brother.

271
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,842
Here's your sari, Geeta.
Wear it and show me.

272
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:31,059
No, brother, I will wear
this sari on your wedding.

273
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,963
Hey dear! Wow! See, brother?

274
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:37,152
When I left, she was so young.

275
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:38,987
And now she talks like a mature lady?

276
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,601
You are right, Viju.

277
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:46,745
I will have to find a guy
for him and a girl for you together.

278
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,564
We will find the girl and the boy later.

279
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,545
Have the meal first. I have
made the Karela especially for you.

280
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:58,355
- And the Udad Dal?
- Yes, that's also ready.

281
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:02,818
- Really? C'mon.
- Come, all.

282
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:06,296
What nice tea!

283
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,164
- Did you like it?
- Very much.

284
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:13,784
- Viju, I don't get a point.
- Which one?

285
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,964
How come you've got a job abroad?

286
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:24,777
Bhabhi, the company I work
for has branches all over the world.

287
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:26,591
Its head office is in London.

288
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:31,573
I had been after it for a year.

289
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:33,905
Really?

290
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,795
You were after it for a year?

291
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:43,627
Sis..

292
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:46,442
I see. So this is the guy for whom..

293
00:24:46,808 --> 00:24:50,128
My sister left London,
her studies..

294
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,518
And is now also
going to leave the house.

295
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:55,803
Looks nice.

296
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,370
- How's his nature?
- He's very sweet.

297
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:05,915
- He hardly speaks anything.
- It's ok then. - Why?

298
00:25:06,158 --> 00:25:09,608
Because even if he wanted to speak..

299
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:12,424
My dear sister wouldn't
allow him to speak.

300
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,528
Naughty girl! Go away from here.

301
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:22,462
Father, look at this photo.

302
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:24,803
Whose photo is it?

303
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:28,355
My would be brother in law.
Sister met him abroad.

304
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:32,736
Wow! The guy seems to be really good.

305
00:25:33,104 --> 00:25:37,817
What can one say by a photo?
You also looked very good in a photo.

306
00:25:38,401 --> 00:25:40,802
Why do you blame my face?

307
00:25:41,729 --> 00:25:44,268
Look at your own face, please.

308
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:46,957
Mine is much better than yours.

309
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:49,295
It's not as dark as
a snake like yours is.

310
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:54,559
My complexion was
pink till I got married.

311
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:58,362
The night I saw your face after wedding..

312
00:25:58,387 --> 00:26:02,274
My color turned so pale,
it hasn't turned normal till date.

313
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:07,389
I could survive even
after seeing your ugly face..

314
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:11,315
Because I am a
very courageous woman.

315
00:26:11,808 --> 00:26:15,296
If it had been another woman
in my place, she would have died.

316
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:16,748
Got it?

317
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:21,238
Look, dear wife,
I've always listened to you.

318
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:23,421
Now you listen to me once.

319
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:25,179
Let me go to the guy's place.

320
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:29,019
This is the single proposal
we've received in 21 years.

321
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,125
Let at least one of
daughters get married.

322
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,368
I will go there with Rina.

323
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:39,832
Ok. Rina, go with him.
Stop him if he says something wrong.

324
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:52,769
You're in trouble!

325
00:26:57,878 --> 00:26:59,826
Who is it.

326
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,504
Open the door, please.

327
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,069
Tell me first who you are.

328
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:10,309
- Is Mr. Gupta home?
- No one is present in this house.

329
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,901
No one's in? Who are you then?

330
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:18,454
Me? Consider me not present.

331
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:22,159
- Please, go from here.
- What a strange family!

332
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:35,159
- You?
- You?

333
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:40,093
- What are you doing here?
- Silly question! I live here.

334
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:42,123
- You live here?
- Yes.

335
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,845
Where does Mr. Narendu
Prasad Gupta live?

336
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,235
He also lives here.
He is my elder brother.

337
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:58,770
Father, please come.
This is the house.

338
00:27:59,171 --> 00:28:00,844
Goodness!
She's brought her father along.

339
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:02,489
Look, it's a matter between you and me.

340
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,316
What's the need to drag..
I mean to bring your father in it?

341
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,170
- Please come, father.
- You're so stubborn!

342
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,020
Look, a college is a college,
house is house..

343
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:13,830
- Father is father, mother is mother.
- Back off!

344
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:19,585
Can't we settle the college
matter in the college?

345
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:22,336
- Open the door!
- The door? - Yes.

346
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,993
Door! Door.. ok..

347
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:33,668
You're done for!

348
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:37,611
Mister, tell Mr. Gupta
that Mr. Alopi prasad has come.

349
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,310
Why don't you disappear from here?

350
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:41,888
What? What are you thinking?

351
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:44,652
I've come to talk to your brother.

352
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:46,304
- You've come to meet my brother?
- Yes.

353
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,299
Brother is not home.

354
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:49,302
Even if he was,
it wouldn't be of use to meet him.

355
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:54,173
Look, it's a personal matter of ours.
We will decide on it.

356
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,855
- Yes, it will be decided.
- Yes, decided.

357
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,392
- It's a trifle matter..
- A trifle matter?

358
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:03,075
It might be a small
matter for you, mister.

359
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:05,662
But for us it is a big matter.

360
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,744
No, dear! Children make mistakes.

361
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,491
It is children's task to be mischievous..

362
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:12,231
And the elders'
task to forgive them.

363
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:15,989
If kids won't make mistakes,
who else will? You, at this age?

364
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:21,954
- Rina, let's go.
- Yes, please go.

365
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:23,302
Just a minute, father.

366
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:25,538
Now that we've come,
let's go after talking to them.

367
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,503
If Mr. Gupta is not home,
his mother must be home.

368
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,269
Mother? Yes, we will meet his mother.

369
00:29:33,086 --> 00:29:34,408
Mother?

370
00:29:35,165 --> 00:29:38,842
Mother! Yes, she is home,
but she's vowed to keep silent.

371
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:41,124
The priest has said that
she cannot talk to anyone today.

372
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:44,560
- What nonsense are you talking?
- Yes, whom are you..

373
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,176
Bhabhi, come here.

374
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:47,858
We have some guests,
but they are leaving.

375
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:52,271
- No! We have just arrived.
- Yes! Come in! Please, come in.

376
00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:55,602
- Who..
- We had come to meet Mr. Gupta.

377
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:56,721
But as he's not home..

378
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,653
I thought I might meet his mother.
Can I come in?

379
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:02,534
- Please, come. Come.
- Come, child.

380
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:09,673
- Please, be seated.
- Yes, I will.

381
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,773
- Mother!
- What is it, child?

382
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:17,048
There are some guests.

383
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:20,216
Greetings. My name is Alopi prasad.

384
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,162
And she is my daughter, Rina.

385
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,280
Greetings. Please, sit.

386
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:30,304
- Daughter in law, please bring tea.
- Right away, mother.

387
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:33,773
No, no. No need to bother.
We've come to..

388
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:37,582
How do I tell you?

389
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:42,749
My elder daughter,
Nina, has just come from abroad.

390
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:47,047
I've heard that your son,
Viju, was also there.

391
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,165
I am sorry, but I don't recognize you.

392
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,500
Bhabhi, I had teased this
girl very much in the college.

393
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:54,477
But she teased me, too.

394
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,779
And today she's come
with her father to complain.

395
00:30:56,932 --> 00:31:00,160
You made a mistake, so pay for it now.

396
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,813
- Satyen!
- God! I'm in trouble.

397
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,810
Bhabhi, please help me for this
one day. I will always serve you.

398
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,503
- Satyen!
- I'm done for!

399
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:10,679
Mother!

400
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:14,150
I am telling the truth
that I haven't done anything.

401
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:16,441
This is wrong, false, false accusation.

402
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:17,358
What are you saying?

403
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:20,573
- Yes, mother, whatever he has said is false.
- Wow!

404
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,030
I didn't mean you.
I mean your daughter.

405
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,135
Whatever she said to you is wrong.
I mean right..

406
00:31:26,335 --> 00:31:28,035
I mean it is false; all false.

407
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:35,524
- Mister, whatever she told me about you seems to be right.
- Yes?

408
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:38,484
He is my youngest son, Satyen.

409
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,139
Glad to meet you.

410
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:49,026
Is your elder son, Viju, also like him?

411
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:52,984
Viju? How can I praise him myself?

412
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,783
My Viju is greater than him.

413
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:01,772
- Greater than him?
- I'm in trouble!

414
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,002
We will take your leave now.

415
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:06,930
Please, sit.
Have tea at least. Satyen!

416
00:32:07,414 --> 00:32:09,944
Yes! Please, have tea.
How can you leave without having tea?

417
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,415
- You're so strange!
- It is you who are weird.

418
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:15,836
Thank you. Thank you very much.

419
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:19,638
I am a daughter's father;
how can I have tea at your place?

420
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:25,727
Ok, goodbye. Satyen,
please accompany them till the door.

421
00:32:25,915 --> 00:32:29,155
Yes, yes, please come.
I don't feel like letting you go.

422
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,654
Why do you bother?
We can leave by ourselves.

423
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:35,470
We are going. Goodbye.

424
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,443
You? Madam,
do you still have to say something?

425
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:48,998
- Manners.
- Manners? - Yes, manners.

426
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,061
Manners mean good behavior.

427
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:53,270
You didn't even thank me.

428
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:55,848
What if I had really
complained about you?

429
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:58,752
I would have been in real trouble.

430
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:01,684
Listen!

431
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,625
Why did you act in front of mother..

432
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:06,515
As if we had met
for the first time?

433
00:33:07,413 --> 00:33:09,680
- Will I have to tell that, too?
- How will I know then?

434
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:16,442
I heard in the college
that you are very smart.

435
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,094
You're down and out!

436
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:33,661
The thing you told me about yesterday,
I hope that's all fine now?

437
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:35,825
What did you assume?

438
00:33:36,091 --> 00:33:39,006
- That we've made up.
- That's it?

439
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:43,505
- And that our friendship will last long.
- Only friendship?

440
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:46,179
It's possible this friendship
turns to some other relation.

441
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:49,519
Which relation? Tell me.

442
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:51,876
Love.

443
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,694
What else do you want to know now?

444
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,448
Whether I am dreaming all this.

445
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:03,884
You can dream at least.
I can't see anything.

446
00:34:04,178 --> 00:34:07,537
Why? This beautiful scenery,
these clouds..

447
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:09,087
They all are with us.

448
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,260
- I don't see any scenery.
- What do you see then?

449
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:20,932
Two eyes of someone,
and the love in them for me.

450
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:25,544
Someone's eyes? Are these eyes mine?

451
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,304
I mean, are you unable
to see anything except me?

452
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:36,566
'All scenery is hidden.
O dear, what has happened?'

453
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:42,939
'All scenery is hidden.
O dear, what has happened?'

454
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:49,070
'You applied kohl and
the day turned to night.'

455
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:55,064
'You applied kohl and
the day turned to night.'

456
00:34:55,652 --> 00:35:01,034
'Our eyes met each other's.
O dear, what has happened?'

457
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:06,650
'Our eyes met each other's.
O dear, what has happened?'

458
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:12,345
'A heart called another
heart and they had a meeting.'

459
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:18,758
'A heart called another
heart and they had a meeting.'

460
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,157
'Don't come tomorrow
and nor call me here.'

461
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:39,970
'The world will taunt us.'

462
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:43,587
'Don't come tomorrow
and nor call me here.'

463
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:46,109
'The world will taunt us.'

464
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,701
'Last night you made an excuse.'

465
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:57,707
'Dear, you said
you can't come today.'

466
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:06,793
'But you came over.
O dear, what has happened?'

467
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:12,156
'But you came over.
O dear, what has happened?'

468
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:17,977
'I've left the world
and am with you.'

469
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:23,603
'I've left the world
and am with you.'

470
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:29,882
'You applied kohl and
the day turned to night.'

471
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:51,331
'A black cuckoo is singing
on the branch of a mango tree.'

472
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:57,040
'A black cuckoo is singing
on the branch of a mango tree.'

473
00:36:57,149 --> 00:37:02,496
'There must be some reason
behind the arrival of monsoon.'

474
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:08,343
'There must be a purpose
behind the spreading clouds.'

475
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:17,402
'The clouds are pouring out.
O dear, what has happened?'

476
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:22,926
'The clouds are pouring out.
O dear, what has happened?'

477
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:28,482
'It is raining because
your drape flew.'

478
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:34,217
'It is raining because
your drape flew.'

479
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:40,112
'A heart called another
heart and they had a meeting.'

480
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:04,610
'I beg of you, don't leave my hand.'

481
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:07,113
'In this shadow of stars.'

482
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,750
'I beg of you, don't leave my hand.'

483
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:12,919
'In this shadow of stars.'

484
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:18,587
'There was a day when
you didn't even look at me.'

485
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:25,126
'And now is a day when
you keep awake all night.'

486
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,961
'The pretty girl is restless.
O dear, what has happened?'

487
00:38:33,235 --> 00:38:38,710
'What I feared has happened,
o ruthless man.'

488
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:44,561
'What I feared has happened,
o ruthless man.'

489
00:38:45,344 --> 00:38:50,130
'All scenery is hidden.
O dear, what has happened?'

490
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,530
'A heart called another
heart and they had a meeting.'

491
00:38:55,766 --> 00:39:01,130
'A heart called another
heart and they had a meeting.'

492
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,844
Nina, you are going to
marry him against my wish.

493
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:07,942
But be careful about this point.

494
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,582
Control your husband
right from the first day.

495
00:39:13,614 --> 00:39:16,043
Or your life will be
ruined just as mine was.

496
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:21,352
Dear me! Listen to her! Her life
is ruined because of marrying me.

497
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,406
Of course. I came as your bride..

498
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:27,134
But never enjoyed
the life as a young wife.

499
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,243
You are right, dear wife.

500
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,379
You gave birth to our daughters
in your old age, right?

501
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:37,551
Your brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts..

502
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:40,829
How many shall I count?
I got 18 people married.

503
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,485
I say, Nina, get a separate house..

504
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,048
For yourself after marriage.

505
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:47,358
Or you will have to get
married your sister in law..

506
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:49,783
Brother in law, and both
the kids of elder brother in law.

507
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:51,775
But how can that be possible, mother?

508
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,683
He loves his family very much.

509
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:58,320
Shut up, silly! I will tell you how
to do it. It's a simple game for me.

510
00:39:58,665 --> 00:40:02,923
Yes, you've been playing
the same game for 21 years with me.

511
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:05,930
Enough! Keep quiet!
Don't interfere between us.

512
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:08,446
That's the only thing left for me to do.

513
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,975
Use it some other day.

514
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:13,408
One can't talk sense in his presence.
Come with me.

515
00:40:14,947 --> 00:40:17,878
Go, Nina.
You've got your mother's face..

516
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:19,668
Now also get her way of thinking.

517
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:22,465
Marriages are not decided this way.

518
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:25,550
One has to call the priest
and find the auspicious day.

519
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,415
How will the wedding be, mother?

520
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,155
Just like other weddings.

521
00:40:30,005 --> 00:40:34,085
I wish the bride would come
to our house sitting in a Doli.

522
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:36,839
Mother, the brides don't
come in Dolis these days.

523
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:38,263
They come by car.

524
00:40:38,288 --> 00:40:40,149
And uncle should come riding a horse.

525
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:43,782
- Right, uncle? Right, uncle?
- Yes, dear, fool your uncle.

526
00:40:44,973 --> 00:40:47,008
But where shall we make
arrangement for the guests?

527
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:49,409
Mother, everyone has
reception these days.

528
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,387
We shall also arrange a reception,
at Taj Hotel.

529
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,210
My dear, first ask him what
sort of wedding would he like.

530
00:40:56,963 --> 00:41:00,097
If you ask me,
all these traditions are useless.

531
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:07,234
Which traditions, child?

532
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:10,665
This marriage pavilion,
calling the band people..

533
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:13,706
The Doli, the circles..
All this is worthless.

534
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:17,884
And because of these useless
things our country is getting ruined.

535
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:21,780
The cheaper the wedding these days,
the better.

536
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,270
What sort of marriage would you like?

537
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:29,222
I like civil marriage.
The boy and the girl sign..

538
00:41:29,535 --> 00:41:33,117
In front of two witnesses
and the marriage is solemnized.

539
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:36,806
A seal worth 2 rupees, and
the marriage is done in 2 minutes.

540
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:39,991
Nina, you're getting late.

541
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:42,880
Mother, I'll drop Nina at her home.

542
00:41:43,943 --> 00:41:45,294
Ok, goodbye.

543
00:41:55,189 --> 00:41:56,189
Go, Raju.

544
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:03,251
This girl is not worth being
the daughter in law of this family.

545
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:05,374
Why, mother?

546
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:08,728
To mock marriage like this..

547
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,464
To talk about one's
own wedding like this..

548
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:15,456
Mother, perhaps she wants
to save our expenditure.

549
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:20,618
But she does not care about
any traditions or the society.

550
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:24,618
Mother, she is an educated
girl with modern way of thinking.

551
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,618
She's just returned from abroad.

552
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:29,618
She'll mix with us when
she comes to this house.

553
00:42:30,537 --> 00:42:32,575
Don't worry about that.
I take that responsibility.

554
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
You also sign.

555
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:42,373
Now you are husband and wife.
Congratulations.

556
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:45,756
- Congratulations on our wedding.
- Same to you.

557
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:02,720
Dear Uncle.

558
00:43:02,771 --> 00:43:04,271
Uncle!

559
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:07,559
What was the need to call the kids here?

560
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,844
How sweet!
It is you who called them in.

561
00:43:11,305 --> 00:43:12,448
Are you out of your senses?

562
00:43:12,473 --> 00:43:15,928
No, I am all right.
I am not mad like you.

563
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,192
Please, think of a way to get them out.

564
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:24,003
No, you will think over it.
The one who needs it.

565
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:30,702
Raju, Guddi,
it's time to go to bed. C'mon.

566
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:32,131
Come, Guddi, let's go to sleep.

567
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:35,285
Not here, kids.
Mother is calling you down.

568
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,537
We will sleep with you, uncle.

569
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:41,127
Uncle, we used to sleep with you earlier.

570
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:43,828
Yes.. but now.. well, the..

571
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:46,408
Uncle, why do you stammer?

572
00:43:46,517 --> 00:43:51,935
I mean you used to sleep with me,
but.. now.. now.. Nina..

573
00:43:54,991 --> 00:43:59,595
That's fine,
kids, but now auntie is here.

574
00:44:00,191 --> 00:44:03,415
- So what if auntie has come? I will sleep with auntie.
- What?

575
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,209
And I will sleep with you.

576
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,992
- No, uncle. Guddi has made a mistake.
- Very good.

577
00:44:11,288 --> 00:44:14,223
Guddi will sleep with auntie.
And I will sleep with you.

578
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:18,772
- But you both will sleep here, right?
- Of course.

579
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:21,711
O God!

580
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:29,425
- Where shall I put this?
- Put it over there for time being.

581
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:31,248
I will tell you later.

582
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:35,001
Be careful.

583
00:44:37,948 --> 00:44:39,596
It's a valuable thing; be careful.

584
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:41,749
Move. I'll do it.

585
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:47,050
Madam, where shall we put this chair?

586
00:44:48,347 --> 00:44:50,576
What idiots I have to deal with!

587
00:44:54,244 --> 00:44:57,262
Didn't I tell you to remove
all the old furniture out?

588
00:44:57,482 --> 00:44:58,798
Why do you keep asking me?

589
00:44:59,453 --> 00:45:00,803
Daughter in law..

590
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:05,247
Perhaps that old chair
looks bad with this new furniture.

591
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,530
But it is your father in law's chair.

592
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:09,749
Navendu likes it very much.

593
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,681
Nobody except him sits on it.

594
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:17,134
Very good.

595
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,617
Then let this chair stay in his room.

596
00:45:23,534 --> 00:45:26,298
He won't have to take the
trouble of coming till here.

597
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,856
And then, nobody will
touch this priceless chair too.

598
00:45:40,252 --> 00:45:42,541
Dare you touch that photo. Move away.

599
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,534
Sorry, sister-in-law. This
fool was pulling down father's photo.

600
00:45:47,284 --> 00:45:49,119
I had told him to remove it.

601
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:50,823
You had said it?

602
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,524
Knowing that it is father's photo..

603
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:55,040
Your father-in-laws?

604
00:45:55,685 --> 00:45:58,693
Yes. I think that
keeping the photographs..

605
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:02,047
Of the ancestors in the
drawing room is old fashioned.

606
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:04,060
What can be said about your thoughts?

607
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:07,117
Today the photos of the
ancestors are out of fashion.

608
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:08,814
It is possible that the ancestors..

609
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:10,462
Are out of fashion tomorrow too.

610
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,869
Behave yourself. I thought
that you studied in the college.

611
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:16,068
Surely, I do.
But one doesn't learn in college..

612
00:46:16,624 --> 00:46:18,696
To remove the
ancestor's photograph..

613
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:23,325
And put up some
monkey or horse's photo.

614
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:26,513
If you understood modern art,
you'd praise these pictures.

615
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,854
Keep such a modern art to yourself.

616
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:31,478
It doesn't even let one
remember their ancestors.

617
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:33,068
Satyen..

618
00:46:34,308 --> 00:46:35,246
What is the matter, Satyen?

619
00:46:35,326 --> 00:46:37,883
Brother..
Sister-in-law doesn't like..

620
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:40,445
- Father's photo in the drawing room.
- It is right.

621
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:43,109
I think..

622
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,604
Father's photo would look better..

623
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:48,401
In my room than the drawing room.

624
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,410
- What do you think about it?
- Brother..

625
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,955
You have done right.

626
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:07,083
You changed the face of the hall.
I liked it.

627
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:16,583
- Hey..
- Yes?

628
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:18,530
How do I look?

629
00:47:18,775 --> 00:47:21,128
- Very beautiful.
- And my dress?

630
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,528
- The worst.
- Why?

631
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,198
Oh! Is there a difference between
girls and boy's clothing or not?

632
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:28,340
And then when you
girls go to the college..

633
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:29,805
Wearing these clothes, will the..

634
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,816
Boys look at your
dress or at their books?

635
00:47:32,445 --> 00:47:35,349
Therefore the result of the
university is poor year by year.

636
00:47:35,673 --> 00:47:38,040
Okay, sir, please tell me.

637
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:39,634
Which clothes should I wear?

638
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:41,684
Girl.. you are a Indian woman..

639
00:47:41,748 --> 00:47:43,308
Wear a proper and simple saree.

640
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:45,380
Whatever you wish.

641
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:03,825
Who is it?

642
00:48:18,158 --> 00:48:19,158
What is this?

643
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:21,379
Here..

644
00:48:21,612 --> 00:48:25,249
When I used to wear a chudidar
kameez you didn't like it.

645
00:48:25,704 --> 00:48:28,342
Now when I wear a saree
even then you don't like it.

646
00:48:30,937 --> 00:48:34,861
I will die on your simplicity.
Is this a simple saree?

647
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,788
Of course.

648
00:48:38,907 --> 00:48:40,878
My mother wears a saree like this.

649
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:44,280
My grandma wears a saree like this.
And my grandma's grandma too.

650
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:47,025
Is it is it? They must be wearing it.

651
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,372
Surely they must be wearing it.
But like this?

652
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,927
These flowers and such?

653
00:48:52,168 --> 00:48:53,762
These rhythming anklets..

654
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:55,355
See..Reena.

655
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,411
Let me teach.
Don't piss me off. Go away, please.

656
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:10,484
Reena.. what is this?

657
00:49:14,487 --> 00:49:16,969
I am telling you for
the last time go from here.

658
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:19,708
Go. Vanish..

659
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,318
What are you doing?

660
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:46,558
This ornament.

661
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,162
Ornament?

662
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,215
Why are you making it shine?

663
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:58,919
Nothing will shine now, understood?

664
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:15,128
What is this joke?

665
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,192
"The Bindiya (forehead
dot) will shine.."

666
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,008
"The bangles will rhythm."

667
00:50:21,356 --> 00:50:23,934
"The Bindiya (forehead
dot) will shine.."

668
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:26,467
"The bangles will rhythm."

669
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:32,567
"Whether you get sleep or not."

670
00:50:32,701 --> 00:50:35,320
"The garland will have an aroma."

671
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,952
"The flowers will have an aroma."

672
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:41,111
"The garland will have an aroma."

673
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:43,955
"The flowers will have an aroma."

674
00:50:44,304 --> 00:50:49,763
"Whether you get angry or not."

675
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:52,432
"The Bindiya (forehead
dot) will shine.."

676
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:55,133
"The bangles will rhythm."

677
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:11,656
"I accept you have become crazy."

678
00:51:11,822 --> 00:51:15,613
"There has been something
wrong done to you."

679
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:22,858
"I accept you have become crazy."

680
00:51:23,074 --> 00:51:26,947
"There has been something
wrong done to you."

681
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:32,857
"Where do I take my eyelashes?"

682
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:38,128
"Through the eye of this ornament."

683
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,379
"Through the eye of this ornament."

684
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:49,703
"No matter if the guys turns about."

685
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:52,444
"The Bindiya (forehead
dot) will shine.."

686
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:55,127
"The bangles will rhythm."

687
00:52:21,113 --> 00:52:29,113
"If someone's bangle speaks,
there is no pressure on youth."

688
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:37,480
"If someone's bangle speaks,
there is no pressure on youth."

689
00:52:41,344 --> 00:52:43,454
"Even if the world refuses me a..

690
00:52:43,534 --> 00:52:46,593
Thousand times
my anklets tell me."

691
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:48,729
"They will rhythm.."

692
00:52:49,364 --> 00:52:51,538
"The maiden will dance."

693
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:54,489
"They will rhythm.."

694
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:57,164
"The maiden will dance."

695
00:52:57,958 --> 00:53:03,103
"Whether the roof falls down or not."

696
00:53:03,336 --> 00:53:05,502
"The Bindiya (forehead
dot) will shine.."

697
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,648
"The bangles will rhythm."

698
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:28,226
"I have loved you,
not accepted your slavery."

699
00:53:28,828 --> 00:53:36,828
"I have loved you,
not accepted your slavery."

700
00:53:40,374 --> 00:53:45,352
"Whether anyone has a broken heart,
or gets angry with me."

701
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:50,316
"I will play and I will flirt."

702
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,939
"I will play and I will flirt."

703
00:53:56,634 --> 00:54:02,057
"Whether I gain enemies or not."

704
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:04,489
"The Bindiya (forehead dot)
will shine.."

705
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,207
"The bangles will rhythm."

706
00:54:21,536 --> 00:54:29,536
"The night that you come to my
house with the marriage procession."

707
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:37,800
"The night that you come to my
house with the marriage procession."

708
00:54:41,352 --> 00:54:46,296
"I won't sit in the palanquin
and tell my father."

709
00:54:46,322 --> 00:54:51,559
"I won't go. I won't go."

710
00:54:51,818 --> 00:54:56,375
"I won't go. I won't go."

711
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:02,651
"Whether the relation
is broken or not."

712
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:05,295
"The Bindiya (forehead dot)
will shine.."

713
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,993
"The bangles will rhythm."

714
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:14,703
- One..
- Ten..

715
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:16,069
- Two..
- Nine..

716
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:16,714
Three...

717
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:19,005
- Eight..
- Four..

718
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:20,583
- Seven..
- Oh! Stop this.

719
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:23,880
You have been told not
to touch anything so many times.

720
00:55:24,018 --> 00:55:25,391
What if it conks off or something?

721
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:27,889
Raju had told us..
C'mon, put on the radio.

722
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,694
Do you know how to play it?

723
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:31,983
Hey, Raju, why did you tell it?

724
00:55:32,201 --> 00:55:34,458
What did I know that it was so costly?

725
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:37,686
You talk like a grandpa.

726
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:40,135
Didn't anyone teach you at home..

727
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,652
That you don't touch other's
things without asking them?

728
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:43,789
Run away from here.

729
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:45,142
I am sorry, sister-in-law.

730
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:47,690
These kids just know that everything..

731
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,576
Comes in this house
is the property of everyone.

732
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,049
They didn't know..

733
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:53,976
That these things are yours,
just yours.

734
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,896
Very good.

735
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:58,110
Then why didn't you teach them..

736
00:55:58,301 --> 00:56:01,404
That the radiogram is
as expensive as it is delicate?

737
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:03,932
A little error can cause it to conk off.

738
00:56:05,116 --> 00:56:06,257
Actually, it was my mistake.

739
00:56:06,378 --> 00:56:09,167
I was so absorbed in preparing the
sketch I didn't remember it at all.

740
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:12,728
I will teach them to work the radio.

741
00:56:13,175 --> 00:56:14,375
You will teach them?

742
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:19,560
You don't even know that
the sofa is for sitting, not lying.

743
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:22,362
You are right.

744
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,962
This sofa is for sitting.
Especially, this sofa.

745
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,801
Which is yours.

746
00:56:44,073 --> 00:56:48,406
I didn't think that Satyen
would act so insolently.

747
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:51,341
But.. what happened?

748
00:56:52,464 --> 00:56:55,757
The kids were playing with the radio.
I dissuaded them.

749
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:57,799
Mr. Satyen started shouting at me.

750
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,163
What was the need to shout at me?

751
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:03,517
Why don't you ask this to Satyen?

752
00:57:03,811 --> 00:57:05,397
He had me hear so many things.

753
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:07,157
I ask you..

754
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,798
If my father is rich, what is my fault?

755
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,004
Being his daughter,
can't he give me anything?

756
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:14,203
Why not, he can give you everything..

757
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:15,753
Then why did Satyen insult me?

758
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:18,668
Why did he speak wrongly
about my father in my presence?

759
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:23,339
But.. why does he need to
speak wrongly about your father?

760
00:57:23,612 --> 00:57:25,077
Go and ask this to Satyen.

761
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:27,248
Okay, come with me.

762
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:36,817
Satyen.. Satyen..

763
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:40,368
- Satyen.
- Yes brother.

764
00:57:41,036 --> 00:57:43,292
How did the furniture
of the hall reach our room?

765
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,755
- I have kept it there.
- Why?

766
00:57:45,985 --> 00:57:49,501
It was lying here, if it would
be down.. the kids would ruin it.

767
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,823
And as it is.. modern
furniture is for modern people.

768
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:54,324
What nonsense?

769
00:57:54,794 --> 00:57:56,365
Then listen to something sensible.

770
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:59,401
That furniture was sent by your..

771
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:02,931
Rich wife's rich
father for his daughter.

772
00:58:03,777 --> 00:58:05,697
Is my wife not related to you in anyway?

773
00:58:06,114 --> 00:58:08,833
If she was related she
wouldn't tell me repeatedly..

774
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:11,089
In the afternoon that
all this furniture is mine..

775
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:12,795
Don't touch anything
without my permission.

776
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:16,046
There is a limit for lying too.
When did I say all this?

777
00:58:16,608 --> 00:58:19,593
The girls of a rich
house have a weak memory.

778
00:58:20,013 --> 00:58:21,916
They forget the words
of the afternoon in the night.

779
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,912
Did you see the attitude in his words?

780
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:25,511
It is your attitude that has to be seen.

781
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:28,206
Satyen.. I don't like
this insolence at all.

782
00:58:28,744 --> 00:58:30,982
If Neela has told you something,
she is elder to you.

783
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,590
You should apologize to her.

784
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:35,100
If I am wrong,
I am ready to apologize to her.

785
00:58:35,587 --> 00:58:36,960
What is the matter, Satyen?

786
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:39,430
The children were playing with the radio.

787
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:41,012
Neela told them not to do it.

788
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:42,951
He chucked all the furniture in our room.

789
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:45,365
Now instead of apologizing to Neela..

790
00:58:45,425 --> 00:58:46,945
He speaking all kinds of gibberish.

791
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,349
What is the matter, Satyen?

792
00:58:49,153 --> 00:58:51,536
Are you shy of apologizing
to sister-in-law?

793
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:53,634
It isn't the matter
of apologizing, brother.

794
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:56,603
The woman who thinks that she..

795
00:58:57,035 --> 00:58:59,587
Is better and right than
every other household member..

796
00:58:59,724 --> 00:59:02,929
Satyen.. there is no
need to cross your limits.

797
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:05,437
I tell you. Apologize to Neela.

798
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,666
She should apologize to me.
She has insulted me.

799
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,312
I don't know who has insulted whom.

800
00:59:11,337 --> 00:59:14,488
All I know is that you
will have to apologize to Neela.

801
00:59:15,972 --> 00:59:18,945
Brother.. You listen to everything
that she says to make her happy.

802
00:59:19,424 --> 00:59:21,649
But the result of pampering
her so much won't be good.

803
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:25,596
I don't want to learn from
you what I should do and not do.

804
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:28,173
Brother..
Looking at her selfishness..

805
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,678
And small heart, I think
that she cannot stay in this house.

806
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:31,768
Uncouth.

807
00:59:35,183 --> 00:59:37,787
Satyen.. why don't you apologize?

808
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:41,013
You are telling this, sister-in-law?

809
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:43,387
You know that I am not at fault.

810
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:50,008
Whether guilty or not, you are younger.

811
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:53,579
And it is never bad for
the young to apologize to elders.

812
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:58,091
Go. Go and apologize to Neela.

813
01:00:05,983 --> 01:00:07,442
I apologize, sister-in-law.

814
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:15,917
Navendu..

815
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:18,545
I am sorry, mother.

816
01:00:18,996 --> 01:00:21,044
For the first time,
I raised my hand on Satyen.

817
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:24,096
I don't know what has happened..

818
01:00:24,983 --> 01:00:27,223
To this house ever since
Neela has come in this house.

819
01:00:27,524 --> 01:00:28,956
Whatever be the case, mother.

820
01:00:29,684 --> 01:00:31,179
She is the daughter-in-law
of the house now, isn't it?

821
01:00:31,203 --> 01:00:34,844
But this doesn't mean all
her mistakes should be covered.

822
01:00:36,124 --> 01:00:37,175
I tell you.

823
01:00:37,477 --> 01:00:39,532
If this spark isn't trampled right now..

824
01:00:40,321 --> 01:00:42,600
It will become a fire
and set fire to the whole house.

825
01:00:42,829 --> 01:00:45,259
- What?
- Can't we live separate?

826
01:00:46,269 --> 01:00:47,291
What do you mean?

827
01:00:47,998 --> 01:00:49,010
I mean..

828
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:52,937
Nowadays..
Everyone lives alone after marriage.

829
01:00:54,561 --> 01:00:56,412
You take a small flat too.

830
01:00:56,859 --> 01:00:58,797
There isn't anyone other than us here.

831
01:00:59,464 --> 01:01:01,617
Even now, there isn't
anyone other than us here.

832
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:06,086
No, Viju,
one's own house is one's own house.

833
01:01:08,188 --> 01:01:13,134
Look here.
There is no curtain or any privacy.

834
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:15,687
Even at this time, elders of young.

835
01:01:15,712 --> 01:01:17,805
Anyone can come to our room.

836
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,305
I am scared of changing clothes too.

837
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,712
Oh! Why don't you lock
the door from inside?

838
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:25,916
Oh no! What will they think?
It doesn't seem right.

839
01:01:25,996 --> 01:01:27,944
Forget these worthless things.

840
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:31,603
Tonight is not for such things.

841
01:01:32,066 --> 01:01:34,867
No Viju, you always skirt this issue.

842
01:01:35,043 --> 01:01:37,072
- Which issue?
- About the new apartment.

843
01:01:37,328 --> 01:01:40,727
Okay. We will do as you wish, okay?

844
01:01:43,194 --> 01:01:44,823
- Who is it?
- Me..

845
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:48,933
- Can I come inside?
- Who is it?

846
01:01:49,155 --> 01:01:52,853
Oh! So you don't recognize me now..

847
01:01:52,878 --> 01:01:54,974
Oh.. come,
please come, please have a seat.

848
01:01:55,122 --> 01:01:57,658
What will I do if I don't sit?

849
01:01:58,102 --> 01:02:01,909
I thought that it is many days,
I'd remind you.

850
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:03,625
Seth.. I remember everything.

851
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:06,194
So what if you remember?

852
01:02:06,608 --> 01:02:08,325
Even Viju is married off now.

853
01:02:08,443 --> 01:02:12,511
And if God agrees.. there
will be a son in a few days too.

854
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:14,983
Oh Seth.. I will sweeten your mouth.

855
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,642
Well, you have filled my mouth..

856
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,379
Now, when will you fill my wallet?

857
01:02:19,634 --> 01:02:23,732
See. I don't go to
the court in small matters.

858
01:02:23,812 --> 01:02:26,511
What are you talking about courts?

859
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:28,112
It is so sad that you say like this.

860
01:02:28,192 --> 01:02:29,703
Tell me. Till when should I wait?

861
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:32,913
What till when?
Wait for two minutes, I will come.

862
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,900
Viju..

863
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,936
Elder brother.. come brother.

864
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:46,628
It is the third today, Viju.
You didn't get the salary?

865
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:52,350
He did get the salary.
But I thought..

866
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:56,213
It is better if I keep his salary.

867
01:02:58,872 --> 01:02:59,872
Yes.

868
01:03:01,296 --> 01:03:03,849
Yes. It is good. It is very good.

869
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:06,823
A wife has a right
on a husband's earning.

870
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:10,363
Like that,
our staying and food expenses..

871
01:03:10,388 --> 01:03:12,543
Work out to be
three hundred rupees.

872
01:03:13,516 --> 01:03:17,546
If you do need money other than that,
just ask me.

873
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:23,288
Yes. Why not?

874
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:26,257
I will have to tell you.

875
01:03:47,871 --> 01:03:48,871
Seth..

876
01:03:51,282 --> 01:03:52,357
I am sorry.

877
01:03:52,847 --> 01:03:55,259
- I will not be able to serve you this month.
- What?

878
01:03:55,284 --> 01:03:57,771
But your money will
be arranged next month.

879
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:58,857
I promise you.

880
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:02,261
See, I don't need your promise.
I need my money.

881
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:04,684
If I don't get my
installment the next month..

882
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:06,432
Then think about it. Yes.

883
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:17,774
Wait.. wait..

884
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,712
- Is this Neela's house?
- No.

885
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:23,232
Whose house is this?

886
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:27,412
The name of the owner of
this house is Navendu Prasad Gupta.

887
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,992
See, do you know where Neela lives?

888
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,341
She lives here.

889
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:34,546
- Then who are you?
- I am a man.

890
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:37,471
Even we can see that you are a man.
But what are you doing here?

891
01:04:37,714 --> 01:04:39,142
I am standing here and talking to you.

892
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,381
But who are you?

893
01:04:41,105 --> 01:04:42,657
Think that I am a servant.

894
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,687
Then go and tell Neela
that his guests have arrived.

895
01:04:47,265 --> 01:04:47,916
Come.. please come..

896
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:53,635
- Hi..
- Hello, hi, Neeta, Hi Sushma.. Hi, Kanta.. oh, have a seat.

897
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:58,447
Should I bring some tea
or something for your guests?

898
01:04:58,563 --> 01:05:00,987
Of course, and please be quick about it.

899
01:05:02,163 --> 01:05:03,602
Hey, eat it.

900
01:05:03,627 --> 01:05:04,892
I couldn't see the movie.

901
01:05:04,979 --> 01:05:06,561
There were so many guests in my house.

902
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:09,169
I was all ready. I was so angry.

903
01:05:10,613 --> 01:05:12,837
Here.. Have you
made all these things?

904
01:05:13,282 --> 01:05:16,938
- Why? Didn't you like them?
- No, they are very good.

905
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:18,269
So, why don't you take some more?

906
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:19,528
Since when are you cooking?

907
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,916
Since some fifteen to twenty years.

908
01:05:30,738 --> 01:05:32,186
If the tea is ready, just get it.

909
01:05:32,532 --> 01:05:35,046
- Where did you work before this?
- Yes?

910
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,009
Where were you servant before this?

911
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:41,187
Me?

912
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:45,493
I am working in this
house since the beginning.

913
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:46,900
Geeta has come.

914
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:53,865
- Now can I ask you something?
- You?

915
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:56,500
- Where did you work before this?
- What?

916
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:58,827
Why are you staring at me?

917
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,650
- What do you mean?
- I mean what I say. - Satyen!

918
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,712
You have nice friends.
They don't even know how to talk.

919
01:06:04,842 --> 01:06:06,622
Who are you to teach us how to speak?

920
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,120
Madam..

921
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,784
If you become a wax doll,
nothing is achieved in life.

922
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:14,701
It is necessary to learn
how to speak other's houses too.

923
01:06:14,726 --> 01:06:17,094
- Oh! You shut up!
- You shut up!

924
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:18,487
- God..
- Out!

925
01:06:18,753 --> 01:06:20,675
Satyen.. don't forget
that they are my friends.

926
01:06:21,628 --> 01:06:23,392
Therefore I am using just my tongue.

927
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:24,713
And listen..

928
01:06:24,802 --> 01:06:26,172
Your friends too don't have any right..

929
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:27,482
To think that my
sister-in-law is a cook..

930
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:30,146
And that my sister is a servant.
Tell them to go away from here.

931
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:32,453
Wow, Neela.
You abused us well calling us here.

932
01:06:32,478 --> 01:06:34,291
You were so hospitable, oh my god.

933
01:06:34,464 --> 01:06:37,121
If there was something less
in hospitality should I fulfill it?

934
01:06:37,298 --> 01:06:39,537
Satyen.. if they go, even I will go.

935
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:41,380
By chance.. the door is open.

936
01:06:41,526 --> 01:06:44,140
- Come on, Sushma.
- Come on.

937
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:45,591
Such insult.

938
01:06:47,816 --> 01:06:50,998
Wait. If I don't
teach them a lesson..

939
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:53,862
Then do change my name as well.

940
01:06:54,158 --> 01:06:58,634
There is a new problem.

941
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:00,442
Did you say anything to me?

942
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,355
I am not mad like you.

943
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:10,203
I challenge just one enemy at one time.

944
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:12,649
What? I am your enemy?

945
01:07:13,752 --> 01:07:19,735
I was speaking about these chess pieces.

946
01:07:19,776 --> 01:07:23,726
Who is it, Viju?
See, I am Neela's mother.

947
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:27,863
You come quickly. Yes, right now.

948
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,341
Neela. You won't
get such a chance again.

949
01:07:33,822 --> 01:07:35,740
Take advantage of Satyen's mistake.

950
01:07:36,066 --> 01:07:38,439
And come out of this problem of a family.

951
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:44,562
It seems that Rahu and Ketu have..

952
01:07:44,587 --> 01:07:49,221
Sat in poor Navendu's
horoscope this year.

953
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:51,051
Reena's mother..

954
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:55,217
It is not good to meddle
in Neela's house matters.

955
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:58,058
You shut your mouth.
How many times have I told you..

956
01:07:58,161 --> 01:07:59,910
Not interfere
in the family affairs.

957
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:03,803
Where am I talking about my house?

958
01:08:04,245 --> 01:08:07,600
I am talking about Navendu's house.

959
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,829
You just look at your chess pieces.

960
01:08:10,346 --> 01:08:12,611
Neela, I will show you such a way out..

961
01:08:12,636 --> 01:08:14,686
That even you will remember it.

962
01:08:15,713 --> 01:08:16,912
Now let it be, sister.

963
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:18,877
Why do you think so
much about small matters?

964
01:08:18,901 --> 01:08:19,901
Wow..

965
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:22,166
On whose money the whole family runs..

966
01:08:22,246 --> 01:08:24,417
She was chucked
out of the house along..

967
01:08:24,536 --> 01:08:27,132
With all her guests, and
you say that it is a small matter.

968
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:28,933
Even sister must be guilty in this.

969
01:08:29,117 --> 01:08:30,605
She is after them since so long.

970
01:08:30,765 --> 01:08:32,165
You don't advocate their cause.

971
01:08:32,578 --> 01:08:36,267
Neela. I will tell you a
solution to cure them. Come with me?

972
01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:43,935
Tell me too.
How should I make you all right?

973
01:08:46,441 --> 01:08:49,134
Daughter-in-law..
What is Navendu doing?

974
01:08:50,389 --> 01:08:52,812
He is sitting with the accounts,
what else?

975
01:08:54,558 --> 01:08:56,915
Viju.. you people are returning now?

976
01:08:57,001 --> 01:08:58,855
We were waiting for you since so long..

977
01:08:59,033 --> 01:09:00,313
That you come and we eat dinner.

978
01:09:00,462 --> 01:09:01,932
Come sit.

979
01:09:04,091 --> 01:09:05,668
Come on, sit down. We will have food.

980
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:07,082
What about food?

981
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,264
Even having water in
this house is a sin for me.

982
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:14,471
No, daughter-in-law,
one doesn't speak like this.

983
01:09:15,692 --> 01:09:18,012
I know that you felt
bad about what Satyen said.

984
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,644
I apologize to you for that.

985
01:09:21,014 --> 01:09:24,278
Neela.. you are responsible
for whatever happened.

986
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:28,444
You didn't introduce Madhavi
and Geeta to your friends.

987
01:09:29,401 --> 01:09:32,248
Let it be, mother. What is
the need of increasing the matter?

988
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,862
When I don't have any complaints,
why do you worry?

989
01:09:38,051 --> 01:09:39,763
Neela.. please spit out this anger.

990
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,194
Such small matters
do take place in the house.

991
01:09:43,956 --> 01:09:46,417
Don't give me this sympathy.
You set the fire yourself.

992
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:47,817
And you yourself sprinkle water?

993
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:50,168
Neela.. think about
what you are saying.

994
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:52,767
Madhavi is the elder
daughter-in-law of this house.

995
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:54,635
And as if I am nothing in this house.

996
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
No, Neela.

997
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,862
- Even you are a daughter-in-law of this house.
- No!

998
01:09:58,208 --> 01:10:00,179
Only the woman who dances on..

999
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:02,154
The signals of the mother-in-law..

1000
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:03,841
Can be a daughter-in-law
in this house.

1001
01:10:04,455 --> 01:10:07,377
I am educated.
I am the daughter of a rich father.

1002
01:10:07,784 --> 01:10:09,204
I have a respect in the society.

1003
01:10:09,361 --> 01:10:11,852
Therefore everyone on
the house is jealous of me.

1004
01:10:11,885 --> 01:10:12,935
And everyone hates me.

1005
01:10:13,237 --> 01:10:16,485
Neela, they don't hate you,
they hate your poisoned words.

1006
01:10:17,157 --> 01:10:18,157
Think about it.

1007
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:20,311
Did you ever have Geeta sit with you?

1008
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,333
Did you speak nicely to Satyen?

1009
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:25,178
Did you ever embrace the children?

1010
01:10:25,756 --> 01:10:26,947
You say that nobody thought you..

1011
01:10:26,971 --> 01:10:28,451
A daughter-in-law in this house.

1012
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,415
I ask you..

1013
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:33,857
Did you ever give respect
to Madhavi or me..

1014
01:10:33,898 --> 01:10:36,068
As a daughter-in-law
which you had to?

1015
01:10:36,202 --> 01:10:39,015
The ones who respect others get respect.

1016
01:10:39,383 --> 01:10:41,573
Not for them who think
that the other are wretches.

1017
01:10:42,206 --> 01:10:44,549
I tell you, be silent, please be silent.

1018
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:45,662
Why should I be silent?

1019
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:51,711
I am not that woman who
tolerates all injustice silently.

1020
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,138
I'm the daughter in law
of this house and not the maid.

1021
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,472
I have as much right
on this house as Madhavi has.

1022
01:11:01,155 --> 01:11:03,890
If you had talents like Madhavi..

1023
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,478
Why would we have to see this day?

1024
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:09,029
What kind of talents
does this talented one has?

1025
01:11:09,319 --> 01:11:10,614
Let me hear it too.

1026
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,179
She just accepts whatever you say.

1027
01:11:15,415 --> 01:11:18,524
She serves you all through
the day and presses your legs.

1028
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,276
- That's it, isn't it?
- Don't talk, Neela.

1029
01:11:20,722 --> 01:11:22,068
If you don't care about youngsters..

1030
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:23,411
At least give some
respect to the elders.

1031
01:11:23,435 --> 01:11:25,654
When the elders don't
have pity for the elders..

1032
01:11:26,299 --> 01:11:28,427
And they don't have love,
then how can the youngsters..

1033
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,064
Have respect and
dignity for the elders?

1034
01:11:30,088 --> 01:11:33,514
- Neela..
- The people say that mother-in-law is like a mother.

1035
01:11:34,212 --> 01:11:37,615
But I say.. Every mother-in-law
is a enemy of the daughter-in-law.

1036
01:11:37,969 --> 01:11:39,291
She is always after her.

1037
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:41,312
Neela, stop this nonsense.

1038
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:45,316
Your words are out of tolerance now.

1039
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,843
You have insulted everyone in this house.

1040
01:11:47,897 --> 01:11:50,594
You insulted me,
my wife and kids and my brothers.

1041
01:11:50,999 --> 01:11:53,697
But I kept silent. But today..

1042
01:11:56,196 --> 01:11:58,110
You have insulted mother.

1043
01:11:58,655 --> 01:12:01,035
And I will not tolerate
it under any circumstances.

1044
01:12:02,758 --> 01:12:06,570
Come forward,
touch mother's legs and apologize.

1045
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:09,070
I didn't say anything
for which I should apologize.

1046
01:12:09,188 --> 01:12:11,262
You have said a very big thing.

1047
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:14,512
Such a big thing has
never been said in this house.

1048
01:12:14,738 --> 01:12:17,042
- Seek an apology.
- No. Never.

1049
01:12:17,794 --> 01:12:22,000
Neela.. only they are humans
who understand their mistake.

1050
01:12:22,649 --> 01:12:25,132
And the mistake that you
did has just one repentance.

1051
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,657
Fall at her feet and ask
forgiveness from her or else..

1052
01:12:27,682 --> 01:12:30,010
- Or else?
- Or else you don't have any place in this house.

1053
01:12:30,635 --> 01:12:33,432
- Neela..
- Let it be, the matter will increase.

1054
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,051
You don't speak in between.

1055
01:12:35,556 --> 01:12:40,075
Viju.. you tell Neela.
Tell her to apologize to mother.

1056
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,969
I think that it is not necessary,
brother.

1057
01:12:43,432 --> 01:12:44,432
What?

1058
01:12:45,635 --> 01:12:47,638
Whatever Neela has said is the truth.

1059
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:49,908
And telling the truth is no crime.

1060
01:12:50,304 --> 01:12:51,848
You are advocating Neela's cause?

1061
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:54,042
I am her husband.

1062
01:12:54,725 --> 01:12:56,736
All the house hold members
can walk away from here.

1063
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:58,252
But I cannot.

1064
01:12:58,472 --> 01:12:59,772
You can do this?

1065
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:06,137
Okay, Viju.
Listen to my decision too.

1066
01:13:07,805 --> 01:13:09,668
Either you both apologize to mother.

1067
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,332
Or else go away from this house forever.

1068
01:13:13,281 --> 01:13:15,233
- You are saying this?
- Yes, I am saying this.

1069
01:13:16,292 --> 01:13:17,893
The one who insults mother cannot..

1070
01:13:18,028 --> 01:13:19,706
Stay in this house
for even a moment.

1071
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:21,289
So what if he is my own brother?

1072
01:13:24,077 --> 01:13:25,924
- Think about it.
- I have thought about it!

1073
01:13:27,578 --> 01:13:30,126
If you think that Neela
is greater than mother..

1074
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,684
Then even you can go with her,
go away!

1075
01:14:00,132 --> 01:14:02,942
Here.. please have some curd.

1076
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,083
It is said..

1077
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:09,550
The one who eats curd and goes..

1078
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:11,999
Returns some day or the other.

1079
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:14,916
For my sake?

1080
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:19,730
Farewell.

1081
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:28,025
Forgive me, mother.

1082
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:31,723
I didn't fulfill the
promise I gave to father.

1083
01:14:32,454 --> 01:14:35,600
No, son. What did you not do?

1084
01:14:38,804 --> 01:14:41,124
The way you have supported them..

1085
01:14:41,905 --> 01:14:45,039
People don't even support
their children like that.

1086
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:55,345
Did you call me?

1087
01:14:56,645 --> 01:14:58,638
- Yes, please have a seat, Mr. Gupta.
- Thank you.

1088
01:15:01,521 --> 01:15:02,671
Here you are.

1089
01:15:05,011 --> 01:15:08,141
- What is this?
- Notice. And a month's salary.

1090
01:15:12,043 --> 01:15:12,747
Notice?

1091
01:15:12,873 --> 01:15:15,252
And you will get your
provident fund later.

1092
01:15:16,397 --> 01:15:18,835
But what are you saying, sir.

1093
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:21,745
I have worked for this
company for twenty two years.

1094
01:15:21,938 --> 01:15:23,096
I am sorry, Mr. Gupta.

1095
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,216
The company is in doldrums.

1096
01:15:25,963 --> 01:15:27,619
Other people are being answered too.

1097
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:33,019
I can't do anything.
I am sorry. I am very sorry.

1098
01:15:43,725 --> 01:15:46,083
Hey.. what happened?

1099
01:15:46,879 --> 01:15:50,300
- Nothing.. I just fainted.
- Are you all right?

1100
01:15:51,184 --> 01:15:52,184
I was scared.

1101
01:15:52,636 --> 01:15:55,354
What is the matter, son?
You seem very worried?

1102
01:15:55,379 --> 01:15:56,523
Nothing mother.

1103
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,373
I have a headache.

1104
01:15:59,523 --> 01:16:02,181
If you work all through the day,
won't you have a headache?

1105
01:16:02,744 --> 01:16:05,156
Please take your coat off.
I will bring some tea.

1106
01:16:05,231 --> 01:16:06,231
Ok.

1107
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:10,002
I have told you so many times.
Take care of your health.

1108
01:16:10,202 --> 01:16:13,024
Oh! Brother Navendu,
you are at home today?

1109
01:16:13,104 --> 01:16:15,345
Why? Should I be outside
home all the time?

1110
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:17,610
- You should be there.
- Where?

1111
01:16:18,309 --> 01:16:19,994
- At Viju's house.
- Why?

1112
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,966
Mother, don't you know?

1113
01:16:22,297 --> 01:16:25,393
Viju has been promoted,
he has become a big man.

1114
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:26,281
Really?

1115
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:28,779
Yes. He has become a general
manager of the company.

1116
01:16:28,906 --> 01:16:30,836
- The general manager..
- But who told me?

1117
01:16:30,965 --> 01:16:34,559
Viju's driver.. his friend told me.

1118
01:16:35,269 --> 01:16:36,866
It is such good news.

1119
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:40,433
I think as if I have been promoted.

1120
01:16:40,652 --> 01:16:41,707
Congratulations.

1121
01:16:42,325 --> 01:16:44,622
He has become such a big
officer at such a young age..

1122
01:16:44,702 --> 01:16:46,535
Nobody. Nobody becomes one.

1123
01:16:46,615 --> 01:16:49,186
He has a big buffet in his house today.

1124
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:51,962
Pulao.. Biryani..

1125
01:16:52,836 --> 01:16:54,177
Hey.. what are we doing here?

1126
01:16:54,493 --> 01:16:55,421
Come on to his house.

1127
01:16:55,446 --> 01:16:57,616
Yes. We should surely
go to his house.

1128
01:16:57,915 --> 01:16:59,231
- Come on, mother.
- No.

1129
01:16:59,523 --> 01:17:00,972
What are you saying, mother?

1130
01:17:01,879 --> 01:17:03,079
Did he invite you?

1131
01:17:03,965 --> 01:17:06,265
Are household members
needed to be invited?

1132
01:17:06,493 --> 01:17:09,475
Think about it.
He has been promoted today newly.

1133
01:17:09,594 --> 01:17:11,372
Where will he have sense about anything?

1134
01:17:11,626 --> 01:17:14,295
But he should have
thought about the person..

1135
01:17:15,509 --> 01:17:17,485
On whose shoulders
he sat and came till here.

1136
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,901
Mother is right.

1137
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:22,274
A person doesn't even go
to God's house without being called.

1138
01:17:22,298 --> 01:17:23,383
You are strange too, Khan.

1139
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:24,796
You say something and
then something else sometimes.

1140
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:27,672
Think about it. If I don't
reach there to congratulate..

1141
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:30,031
What will Viju think?
What will the world think?

1142
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:33,453
So what if you don't go? I will go.

1143
01:17:34,193 --> 01:17:35,434
He is a strange man.

1144
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:42,012
Khan.. you go with him too.
Navendu is sick today too.

1145
01:17:43,506 --> 01:17:46,313
Don't worry mother. I will go.
Everything will be all right.

1146
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:51,472
Good evening, madam.

1147
01:17:53,807 --> 01:17:55,559
Hey.. where are you going?

1148
01:17:55,792 --> 01:17:57,211
I want to meet your sir.

1149
01:17:57,313 --> 01:17:59,567
Sir.. you cannot meet the sir today.

1150
01:18:01,617 --> 01:18:03,233
I want to meet him for just one minute.

1151
01:18:03,367 --> 01:18:05,632
What kind of a person are you? Didn't
I tell you to go away from here?

1152
01:18:05,656 --> 01:18:08,071
- What is the matter?
- He wants to meet the sir.

1153
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:09,457
Hey, where has he come from?

1154
01:18:09,531 --> 01:18:11,343
Come on from here. Come on.

1155
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,758
- See.. Do you work here?
- What is the matter?

1156
01:18:16,782 --> 01:18:19,007
- Do you work here?
- Yes. I am sir's special bearer.

1157
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:21,460
- Will you do a small task for me?
- What is the matter?

1158
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:26,024
Tell your sir that Navendu
has come to meet him.

1159
01:18:26,172 --> 01:18:27,936
There is a big party in the house.

1160
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:31,343
- You cannot meet sir today.
- Please tell him.

1161
01:18:31,555 --> 01:18:33,727
Okay. You sit here. I will go inside.

1162
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:35,608
- When I come back, I will tell sir.
- Okay.

1163
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:47,026
What is it?
You are sitting on the chair now?

1164
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:48,360
Come on. Get out.

1165
01:18:48,408 --> 01:18:51,317
You don't know me.
Your sir knows me very well.

1166
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:55,344
Go. All the beggars
know the sir know very well.

1167
01:18:55,538 --> 01:18:57,886
Come on, do a good job for me.
Get lost.

1168
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,970
- You wretch. What are you saying?
- Who are you?

1169
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:06,654
If I slap you once,
your father won't recognize you.

1170
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,516
- How did you come here?
- What could I do?

1171
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,594
I stood here and watched
your drama for a long time.

1172
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:14,412
- What kind of a man are you?
- What kind of a man are you?

1173
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:17,164
You drive a man out of the hours first.

1174
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:20,017
And then you ask his name.
Which country has such a rule?

1175
01:19:20,107 --> 01:19:21,593
But who are you?

1176
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:26,641
I am your sir's brother.
And he is your sir's father.

1177
01:19:27,089 --> 01:19:29,832
Now go and tell him that
your brother and father have come.

1178
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:31,041
Go!

1179
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:38,043
- Madam.. madam.. one minute.
- What is the matter?

1180
01:19:38,224 --> 01:19:40,276
- Just a minute.
- Excuse me.

1181
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:43,211
Two people are standing outside.

1182
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:45,312
They say that they are
sir's father and brother.

1183
01:19:45,392 --> 01:19:47,328
What are you saying?
I am telling you the truth..

1184
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:49,231
See, they are standing there.

1185
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,459
Go and tell them to come tomorrow.

1186
01:20:15,029 --> 01:20:18,420
See.. madam told me to
tell you to come tomorrow.

1187
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:22,454
Tell her that we have
just come to congratulate him.

1188
01:20:22,578 --> 01:20:25,462
Oh! Will I work for you or for sir?

1189
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,923
You wretch.
You started speaking again.

1190
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:31,582
- Please speak lower. Why do you shout?
- Get lost.

1191
01:20:34,138 --> 01:20:37,816
Madam, they say that they
have come just to congratulate.

1192
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:42,794
Okay, tell them they
we got their congratulations.

1193
01:20:42,819 --> 01:20:43,819
Okay.

1194
01:20:47,529 --> 01:20:51,465
See. Madam said that they
got their congratulations.

1195
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:52,917
Go.

1196
01:20:54,835 --> 01:20:57,998
- Khan..
- I cannot tolerate your insult.

1197
01:20:58,414 --> 01:21:01,578
I am going and bringing
that donkey to your feet.

1198
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:05,462
What is the need of fighting?
We will come tomorrow.

1199
01:21:06,106 --> 01:21:07,530
Come on.

1200
01:21:14,029 --> 01:21:16,311
The party is lonely without you.
Please come.

1201
01:21:16,656 --> 01:21:17,839
Please come.

1202
01:21:20,138 --> 01:21:21,205
Did you see that?

1203
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,422
Such big people are coming to Vijay.

1204
01:21:25,106 --> 01:21:26,812
She surely must be some princess.

1205
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:31,078
That is all right. But why didn't
you call out to him when he came out?

1206
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:37,020
He would surely come to me,
he would embrace me.

1207
01:21:37,201 --> 01:21:38,879
Then you should have done like that.

1208
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:41,307
But would it be nice to do like that
in the presence of so many people?

1209
01:21:41,331 --> 01:21:42,331
Why?

1210
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:44,265
Wouldn't he be embarrassed?

1211
01:21:44,451 --> 01:21:46,768
Wouldn't people laugh at him?

1212
01:21:46,934 --> 01:21:48,288
You are still..

1213
01:21:50,276 --> 01:21:52,360
What soil are you made up of?

1214
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:56,440
Come.

1215
01:21:58,211 --> 01:21:59,211
Mother..

1216
01:22:01,327 --> 01:22:02,327
It's hot.

1217
01:22:06,794 --> 01:22:09,231
- Did you meet your brother?
- Yes, mother.

1218
01:22:09,451 --> 01:22:10,829
Sit down, Khan.

1219
01:22:11,479 --> 01:22:12,675
What did he say?

1220
01:22:12,863 --> 01:22:15,385
What would he say?
He fell at my feet when he saw me.

1221
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:18,048
I had him embrace me.

1222
01:22:18,127 --> 01:22:21,014
And he acted so nicely with us,
isn't it, Khan?

1223
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,400
Yes.. yes..

1224
01:22:24,426 --> 01:22:28,179
I was scared that he
would refuse to recognize you.

1225
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:30,798
How is that possible?

1226
01:22:30,943 --> 01:22:34,381
Even when I refused,
he dragged me inside.

1227
01:22:34,592 --> 01:22:38,437
He introduced me to everyone.
There were such people there.

1228
01:22:38,584 --> 01:22:39,200
Isn't it, Khan?

1229
01:22:39,225 --> 01:22:44,179
Yes, such lies..
I mean there were such people there.

1230
01:22:45,829 --> 01:22:47,187
What else did he say?

1231
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:51,884
Mother, when he saw me alone,
he was very angry.

1232
01:22:51,909 --> 01:22:55,239
He told me that are the household
members needed to invited?

1233
01:22:56,303 --> 01:22:57,729
What can I tell you, mother?

1234
01:22:57,809 --> 01:23:00,434
I ate so much in happiness..
I ate so much..

1235
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:01,172
Isn't it, Khan?

1236
01:23:01,206 --> 01:23:05,445
Yes. We ate so much mother,
we won't be hungry for four days.

1237
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:10,381
And for the kids,
did he not send anything?

1238
01:23:10,982 --> 01:23:12,839
For the kids.. why not..

1239
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:17,999
- He sent sweets, cake pastries and..
- And round KACHORIES.

1240
01:23:18,024 --> 01:23:24,225
- Kachoris, Samose (snacks) and whatnot.
- Where are all those things?

1241
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:26,126
They are here..

1242
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:29,041
Khan.. I gave you
that basket in the bus?

1243
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:33,731
- In the bus..
- Yes, we came in the moving bus.

1244
01:23:33,756 --> 01:23:35,916
- The basket must be left there.
- Yes, so where is it?

1245
01:23:36,324 --> 01:23:37,033
Left in bus..

1246
01:23:37,232 --> 01:23:38,401
What do you do, Khan?

1247
01:23:38,481 --> 01:23:40,977
I had brought those things for the kids.

1248
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:42,212
Okay.. I will bring it.

1249
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:44,214
Go. Go and bring it quickly.

1250
01:23:45,778 --> 01:23:47,278
He is a strange man.

1251
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,375
Okay, mother.

1252
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:59,530
Madhavi.. something is amiss.

1253
01:24:00,777 --> 01:24:01,827
I will see.

1254
01:24:10,978 --> 01:24:15,261
You will hide it from me?

1255
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,519
What should I tell you, Madhavi?

1256
01:24:21,716 --> 01:24:23,316
Maybe you won't be able to listen to it.

1257
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,438
For God's sake,
tell me what the matter is.

1258
01:24:28,495 --> 01:24:29,495
Madhavi..

1259
01:24:32,425 --> 01:24:35,227
I am jobless from today.

1260
01:24:44,507 --> 01:24:47,186
That's it? Such a small matter?

1261
01:24:48,982 --> 01:24:51,012
I thought what problems
have been created.

1262
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,446
The ground has moved and..

1263
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:55,795
Madhavi..
Is being joblessness a small matter?

1264
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:59,207
Think about it. How will it work now?

1265
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,423
How did it work for so many years?

1266
01:25:04,337 --> 01:25:05,583
Do you know?

1267
01:25:06,192 --> 01:25:09,999
When father expired,
you had such a burden.

1268
01:25:11,569 --> 01:25:16,743
Satyen..
Viju.. Geeta, all were young.

1269
01:25:18,337 --> 01:25:21,260
What is the problem now?
All are grown up now.

1270
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:26,478
That is all right, Madhavi.
But I am not young now.

1271
01:25:27,884 --> 01:25:31,024
My hands and legs are tied.
My back is broken.

1272
01:25:33,364 --> 01:25:35,040
To tell you the truth..

1273
01:25:35,488 --> 01:25:40,158
If Viju didn't leave the house,
would you be defeated like this?

1274
01:25:41,339 --> 01:25:43,990
Till the time your hands and legs
worked, wouldn't you have worked?

1275
01:25:44,234 --> 01:25:47,167
That is all right.. but.. but..

1276
01:25:48,075 --> 01:25:49,075
I know..

1277
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,850
I know..

1278
01:25:54,686 --> 01:25:56,107
You are tired now.

1279
01:25:58,954 --> 01:26:00,254
It is right too.

1280
01:26:01,195 --> 01:26:03,972
You worked all alone for so many years.

1281
01:26:04,487 --> 01:26:06,648
And all of us just kept eating.

1282
01:26:08,567 --> 01:26:12,077
Now let me take up this burden.

1283
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:14,319
Madhavi..

1284
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:18,594
There have been many
fire tests in my life.

1285
01:26:18,803 --> 01:26:23,033
But you never let it's heat reach me.

1286
01:26:26,049 --> 01:26:27,820
And I won't let it reach you even now.

1287
01:26:28,607 --> 01:26:30,923
But Madhavi..
Mother shouldn't know about it.

1288
01:26:35,656 --> 01:26:38,503
- I am ashamed.
- Why?

1289
01:26:39,897 --> 01:26:44,898
I know. Whatever happening
in your house is due to my sister.

1290
01:26:45,657 --> 01:26:47,188
I don't know what to do.

1291
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:50,999
Are there so many problems in the
house just because Viju has left it?

1292
01:26:51,233 --> 01:26:52,233
No, Reena.

1293
01:26:52,978 --> 01:26:54,414
Brother has lost his job.

1294
01:26:56,814 --> 01:26:58,574
All problems don't come together.

1295
01:26:58,919 --> 01:27:00,346
He will get some other job.

1296
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,955
Brother cannot get
any other job at this age.

1297
01:27:03,772 --> 01:27:05,150
He has weak eyes.

1298
01:27:05,793 --> 01:27:08,127
And then, it is torture
to make him work at this age too.

1299
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:10,355
I feel like leaving this education..

1300
01:27:10,435 --> 01:27:12,955
And do some labor
or hard work somewhere.

1301
01:27:13,481 --> 01:27:16,355
But.. But I shouldn't
let brother work.

1302
01:27:16,508 --> 01:27:18,795
Your education will help brother.

1303
01:27:19,176 --> 01:27:20,896
You can help him more
when you are educated.

1304
01:27:20,921 --> 01:27:22,731
Where is the time for education, Reena?

1305
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:26,480
Once that Viju has gone,
Kali will ask for the loan.

1306
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:28,119
And on that side..

1307
01:27:28,713 --> 01:27:30,879
Mother won't be able
to tolerate Viju's separation.

1308
01:27:31,599 --> 01:27:33,056
Everything will be all right.

1309
01:27:33,894 --> 01:27:37,937
If you get a proper job..
I won't let you leave the job.

1310
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:42,244
Mother..
I had told Navendu before hand.

1311
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:45,197
Brother.. if you are taking the loan,
think about it.

1312
01:27:46,169 --> 01:27:47,319
Yes, brother.

1313
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:49,700
Who knew that the situation
would change like this?

1314
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:59,347
Geeta has grown up.

1315
01:28:00,393 --> 01:28:02,701
You were saying something?

1316
01:28:03,436 --> 01:28:04,637
I was saying..

1317
01:28:04,832 --> 01:28:08,992
See, you don't have anything.
But Viju has everything.

1318
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:10,283
What will happen with that?

1319
01:28:10,406 --> 01:28:11,744
What will not happen?

1320
01:28:11,769 --> 01:28:13,455
You had taken a loan on this house.

1321
01:28:14,045 --> 01:28:17,095
And this house is the wealth
of all you three brothers.

1322
01:28:17,706 --> 01:28:18,781
Legally..

1323
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:22,825
I can take the loan back from you,
Satyen or Viju too.

1324
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,713
Tell me, or just one.

1325
01:28:25,156 --> 01:28:26,156
Is this possible?

1326
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:30,138
Why isn't it possible?
It is happening since years.

1327
01:28:30,599 --> 01:28:33,409
Viju has money.
He can repay the loan.

1328
01:28:33,925 --> 01:28:36,412
And then, you had taken the loan for him.

1329
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:38,295
Kali babu is right.

1330
01:28:38,905 --> 01:28:40,388
Let him take the loan from him.

1331
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:42,837
No mother.
I cannot let him do this at all.

1332
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:44,497
What will you do then?

1333
01:28:45,663 --> 01:28:47,448
I will do whatever I can.

1334
01:28:49,012 --> 01:28:50,517
If needed, I will sell myself.

1335
01:28:50,753 --> 01:28:54,167
See. If you sell yourself,
I won't get my money back.

1336
01:28:54,343 --> 01:28:57,318
Navendu.. I have spoken to
you in the tongue of friendship.

1337
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,500
I will have to speak
to you in a legal tongue now.

1338
01:28:59,624 --> 01:29:00,743
Please don't say like that, brother.

1339
01:29:00,767 --> 01:29:02,476
Whatever you say,
this is what will happen.

1340
01:29:02,548 --> 01:29:04,350
I give you time for a week more.

1341
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:07,062
If you don't arrange
for my money in that time..

1342
01:29:07,249 --> 01:29:08,963
Then this house will be auctioned.

1343
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,952
No.. no..

1344
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:12,867
Navendu..

1345
01:29:15,026 --> 01:29:16,217
Mother.. mother..

1346
01:29:16,899 --> 01:29:18,574
Madhu.. Satyen..

1347
01:29:19,036 --> 01:29:22,786
How did you remember me..

1348
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:25,408
You aren't worth to be missed by anyone.

1349
01:29:26,452 --> 01:29:28,081
Then why have come to my house?

1350
01:29:28,192 --> 01:29:29,891
Even my shoe wouldn't come here.

1351
01:29:30,303 --> 01:29:31,851
Aunty has forced me to come here.

1352
01:29:31,985 --> 01:29:33,371
To abuse me?

1353
01:29:34,397 --> 01:29:36,531
Who will spoil their
mouths by abusing you?

1354
01:29:37,058 --> 01:29:40,097
I have just come here to
tell you that mother is not well.

1355
01:29:41,352 --> 01:29:42,352
I see..

1356
01:29:42,558 --> 01:29:43,558
Okay..

1357
01:29:44,095 --> 01:29:45,391
So you can see too?

1358
01:29:46,843 --> 01:29:50,239
Much better and sharper than before.

1359
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,815
If only your heart was
clear like your sight too.

1360
01:29:53,678 --> 01:29:55,412
The ones who have a dirty heart..

1361
01:29:55,566 --> 01:29:57,238
They see everything
bad about others.

1362
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:58,853
That is what I wanted to tell you too.

1363
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,830
It is good that you said it.
I will leave now.

1364
01:30:02,372 --> 01:30:04,822
- Tell brother.
- Listen..

1365
01:30:06,066 --> 01:30:09,256
Don't you want money for mother's cure?

1366
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:10,767
What mother wants..

1367
01:30:10,949 --> 01:30:12,629
Maybe she won't get it from this house.

1368
01:30:13,235 --> 01:30:14,676
What is that?

1369
01:30:16,443 --> 01:30:19,337
A son's love and a
daughter-in-law's duty.

1370
01:30:45,733 --> 01:30:53,722
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1371
01:30:54,549 --> 01:31:02,549
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1372
01:31:03,129 --> 01:31:10,846
"There are two forms of life to live."

1373
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:19,613
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1374
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:46,020
"Think and take your steps,
think about them, crazy man!"

1375
01:31:46,704 --> 01:31:51,856
"Make every man understand this."

1376
01:31:52,438 --> 01:32:00,438
"One road goes to the temple
and the other to the tavern."

1377
01:32:01,131 --> 01:32:05,711
"One shouldn't forget the road."

1378
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:12,538
"The traveler shouldn't be fooled."

1379
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:20,707
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1380
01:32:21,398 --> 01:32:29,398
"There are two forms of life to live."

1381
01:32:29,942 --> 01:32:37,942
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1382
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:08,504
Take this.

1383
01:33:09,982 --> 01:33:11,169
What? Your bangles?

1384
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:13,606
They are not dearer than mother's life..

1385
01:33:13,637 --> 01:33:20,316
"On one side, there are such people..

1386
01:33:20,446 --> 01:33:27,429
Who live for the others,
who live for the others."

1387
01:33:28,267 --> 01:33:31,348
"On the other side, there are people..

1388
01:33:31,535 --> 01:33:39,535
Who suck other's
blood for themselves.!"

1389
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:48,581
"Someone sows flowers
and some scatter thorns."

1390
01:33:48,785 --> 01:33:56,785
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1391
01:33:57,262 --> 01:34:04,965
"There are two forms of life to live."

1392
01:34:05,747 --> 01:34:13,747
"Life has two colors and two ways."

1393
01:34:32,012 --> 01:34:33,012
Has your sir come?

1394
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:37,286
No. He has gone to
the club with madam.

1395
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:40,050
He has kept this letter for you.

1396
01:34:40,785 --> 01:34:42,290
Letter? What is there in this?

1397
01:34:44,189 --> 01:34:45,215
What is there?

1398
01:34:46,987 --> 01:34:50,203
He has sent money.
Maybe for mother's cure.

1399
01:34:52,351 --> 01:34:55,354
Take this.
And give it back to your sir.

1400
01:34:56,831 --> 01:35:00,878
Tell him,
that mother needs a son, not money.

1401
01:35:02,169 --> 01:35:03,169
Greeting sir.

1402
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:07,311
Mother..

1403
01:35:07,391 --> 01:35:09,375
It is great,
it is a miracle, an absolute miracle.

1404
01:35:09,576 --> 01:35:10,865
- What happened?
- Mother..

1405
01:35:11,469 --> 01:35:14,115
If a man does good things,
the god himself helps him.

1406
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:15,547
What happened?

1407
01:35:15,663 --> 01:35:17,735
A money order worth five
hundred rupees has arrived.

1408
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:21,025
From where has it come?
Who has sent it?

1409
01:35:21,434 --> 01:35:23,615
I don't understand
who can send this money.

1410
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:25,693
But whatever be the case, mother.

1411
01:35:25,966 --> 01:35:28,960
At this time, the one who
has sent this money is an angel.

1412
01:35:30,962 --> 01:35:31,962
An angel.

1413
01:35:35,907 --> 01:35:36,976
I understand.

1414
01:35:38,827 --> 01:35:40,131
Please call Khan.

1415
01:35:40,363 --> 01:35:42,472
What is the need of calling Khan?

1416
01:35:42,552 --> 01:35:44,735
Mother has called and Khan has arrived.

1417
01:35:45,211 --> 01:35:46,472
Let me see your hand.

1418
01:35:47,791 --> 01:35:50,866
I swear to god,
your face is so bright today.

1419
01:35:52,256 --> 01:35:54,852
If you talk like this, will I be cured?

1420
01:35:55,716 --> 01:35:57,371
What did I do now, mother?

1421
01:35:58,699 --> 01:36:01,131
Why did you send this
money order for 500 rupees?

1422
01:36:01,426 --> 01:36:03,038
Money order? Which money order?

1423
01:36:03,948 --> 01:36:05,276
Why did you send this money?

1424
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:09,556
Money? What money?
Mother, I didn't send any money.

1425
01:36:10,161 --> 01:36:13,566
You call me mother and you lie too?

1426
01:36:15,137 --> 01:36:18,510
Swear on me.
You didn't send this money?

1427
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:21,981
Don't tell me to swear on you. Don't.

1428
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:26,035
You sent the money.
It is your handiwork.

1429
01:36:27,059 --> 01:36:31,451
Mother, I am your neighbor
since ten to twelve years.

1430
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:35,088
I haven't told you my story till today.

1431
01:36:36,535 --> 01:36:40,302
I was ten years old, my mother expired.

1432
01:36:40,839 --> 01:36:46,217
My father married again.
That mother was very strict.

1433
01:36:47,382 --> 01:36:49,038
She used to lock me up and didn't..

1434
01:36:49,768 --> 01:36:52,937
Give me any food
for three days and beat me.

1435
01:36:53,678 --> 01:36:57,165
At last, I was fed up
and ran away from my country.

1436
01:36:58,064 --> 01:37:01,238
I wandered around and came here.

1437
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:04,908
I came here and saw you, mother.

1438
01:37:06,278 --> 01:37:08,938
You are Narendu's step mother.

1439
01:37:09,543 --> 01:37:12,576
But you love him so much..

1440
01:37:14,008 --> 01:37:18,358
I have an ambition.
If God gives me money..

1441
01:37:18,704 --> 01:37:25,204
I will go to my country
and serve my mother so much..

1442
01:37:25,467 --> 01:37:27,576
That she will embrace me and say..

1443
01:37:27,678 --> 01:37:32,064
Gul Khan is my real son,
he is my real son.

1444
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:37,606
All this has happened because of you.

1445
01:37:37,926 --> 01:37:38,955
But what did I do?

1446
01:37:39,035 --> 01:37:40,758
Why did you send that money?

1447
01:37:40,913 --> 01:37:42,151
So what sin did I commit?

1448
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:43,601
If there is a illness in the house..

1449
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:45,017
Money can be needed at any time.

1450
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:46,666
Then why did they send the money back?

1451
01:37:47,273 --> 01:37:49,706
Your sister-in-law is so arrogant.

1452
01:37:50,292 --> 01:37:52,652
If your money was
used for mother's cure..

1453
01:37:52,732 --> 01:37:54,768
Wouldn't she have lost her face?

1454
01:37:54,963 --> 01:37:56,801
Therefore, she has sent the money back.

1455
01:37:58,484 --> 01:37:59,846
Why don't you understand?

1456
01:38:00,503 --> 01:38:02,855
All this is your Navendu
brother's tricks.

1457
01:38:03,853 --> 01:38:07,525
His mind is as poisoned
as his words are sweet.

1458
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:09,550
Poison?

1459
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:10,880
What else?

1460
01:38:11,391 --> 01:38:13,123
He wants to defame you.

1461
01:38:13,665 --> 01:38:15,431
He wants you have you
fall in people's eyes.

1462
01:38:19,629 --> 01:38:20,629
How?

1463
01:38:21,434 --> 01:38:26,158
By showing the world
that even in the state of..

1464
01:38:27,144 --> 01:38:30,220
Joblessness and poverty
he is looking after his..

1465
01:38:30,626 --> 01:38:33,063
Step mother sister and brother.

1466
01:38:34,114 --> 01:38:35,117
And you..

1467
01:38:36,505 --> 01:38:39,377
Once you got money, you left everyone.

1468
01:38:40,726 --> 01:38:42,062
You forgot everyone.

1469
01:38:50,793 --> 01:38:51,793
Mother..

1470
01:38:53,923 --> 01:38:55,122
See who has come.

1471
01:38:58,710 --> 01:38:59,710
You?

1472
01:39:02,413 --> 01:39:05,301
You got time to meet mother after all.

1473
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:10,961
Mother.. Viju has taken to take you.

1474
01:39:13,133 --> 01:39:14,133
Navendu..

1475
01:39:15,476 --> 01:39:18,236
You have supported me all your life.

1476
01:39:20,967 --> 01:39:23,138
Can you not support
me for a couple more days?

1477
01:39:24,051 --> 01:39:25,525
Please don't say like this, mother.

1478
01:39:25,832 --> 01:39:29,007
You will be cured nicely at Viju's house.

1479
01:39:29,732 --> 01:39:32,597
There will be good medicines
and the best of doctors.

1480
01:39:32,923 --> 01:39:34,670
You will be cured very quickly, mother.

1481
01:39:35,387 --> 01:39:36,387
No, son.

1482
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:39,985
That death which I get
in your house is better..

1483
01:39:40,925 --> 01:39:43,801
Than the life that I
will get living in Viju's house.

1484
01:39:47,753 --> 01:39:48,841
I will not go there.

1485
01:39:49,473 --> 01:39:51,418
Why do you hate me so much after all?

1486
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:55,675
What wrong have I done?
Just that I live separate?

1487
01:39:56,052 --> 01:39:57,801
- And that too because..
- No, Viju..

1488
01:39:58,731 --> 01:40:00,387
Not all that.

1489
01:40:02,793 --> 01:40:06,921
But whatever you did
with your god like brother..

1490
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,591
For that, forget about till I am alive..

1491
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,175
I cannot forgive you
for that even after my death.

1492
01:40:14,457 --> 01:40:18,000
Mother.. let it be. You are ill.

1493
01:40:18,317 --> 01:40:19,804
Let it be, brother.

1494
01:40:20,777 --> 01:40:22,895
The fire that had to
be ignited has been already.

1495
01:40:23,196 --> 01:40:24,883
What is the use of
sprinkling water on it?

1496
01:40:25,033 --> 01:40:26,033
Viju..

1497
01:40:26,775 --> 01:40:29,453
The blood which is so poisonous..

1498
01:40:30,193 --> 01:40:32,230
Cannot be my blood.
I have given birth..

1499
01:40:33,258 --> 01:40:38,190
To you with my womb,
but the truth is..

1500
01:40:38,637 --> 01:40:41,709
Today I am ashamed
to call you my son.

1501
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:46,923
Go away from here, out of my sight!

1502
01:40:55,714 --> 01:40:57,653
Please don't feel bad
about mother's words, Viju.

1503
01:40:58,365 --> 01:41:01,873
Because of her illness,
she has become so weak..

1504
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:04,730
That she cannot tolerate
even a small thing without her wish.

1505
01:41:06,076 --> 01:41:07,656
But this doesn't mean that a mother..

1506
01:41:07,891 --> 01:41:09,769
Cannot tolerate her own son too.

1507
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:11,845
Viju.. it is just
a matter of a few days.

1508
01:41:12,126 --> 01:41:15,316
Let mother get cured.
I will drop her to your house myself.

1509
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:17,505
Keep her at your house
for as many days as you wish.

1510
01:41:17,969 --> 01:41:21,118
Mother will stay with me,
and stay in my house.

1511
01:41:21,586 --> 01:41:22,998
Will you like this, brother?

1512
01:41:23,802 --> 01:41:24,824
What do you mean?

1513
01:41:25,805 --> 01:41:28,118
I know who is doing all this.

1514
01:41:29,214 --> 01:41:32,480
Who has poisoned mother's
ears against me. You!

1515
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:32,996
Viju..

1516
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:36,103
Who has ignited the sparks
of hatred in mother's heart. You!

1517
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:38,918
Who has instigated
the son against the mother.

1518
01:41:39,663 --> 01:41:40,699
- You have..
- Viju..

1519
01:41:41,982 --> 01:41:44,829
What are you saying?
Whom are you talking to?

1520
01:41:45,473 --> 01:41:46,952
Think about whatever you say.

1521
01:41:47,205 --> 01:41:49,651
I have thought about
whatever I am saying.

1522
01:41:50,078 --> 01:41:52,088
It is a sin even to think
like this about brother.

1523
01:41:52,977 --> 01:41:55,648
The brother who ruined his life for us..

1524
01:41:55,972 --> 01:41:58,273
If you cannot give
that brother anything else..

1525
01:41:58,442 --> 01:42:00,246
At least don't give
him false accusations.

1526
01:42:00,271 --> 01:42:01,294
What kind of accusations?

1527
01:42:01,479 --> 01:42:03,634
Whatever I am saying is the truth.

1528
01:42:04,502 --> 01:42:06,399
Do I not have a right on mother?

1529
01:42:06,971 --> 01:42:08,640
Can I not do anything for my mother?

1530
01:42:10,027 --> 01:42:11,961
Look at yourself and see for once.

1531
01:42:12,738 --> 01:42:14,519
What have you done for mother till today?

1532
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,520
You got a wife and you forgot all of us?

1533
01:42:16,621 --> 01:42:17,526
You forgot everything?

1534
01:42:17,606 --> 01:42:19,644
Why do you nag me about
my wife every now and then?

1535
01:42:20,199 --> 01:42:22,138
I have married.
I didn't commit any sin.

1536
01:42:23,086 --> 01:42:26,669
When a man commits a sin,
only he is punished.

1537
01:42:27,236 --> 01:42:30,553
But when he marries,
the whole house is affected.

1538
01:42:31,342 --> 01:42:33,024
Whether is it good or bad.

1539
01:42:33,777 --> 01:42:36,094
If there is a bad effect
on the house due to my marriage..

1540
01:42:36,738 --> 01:42:38,989
The reason for this could
be the household members too.

1541
01:42:39,013 --> 01:42:40,165
Why are you accusing the household..

1542
01:42:40,189 --> 01:42:41,821
Members to hide your weaknesses?

1543
01:42:44,024 --> 01:42:45,024
Leave it.

1544
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:47,098
Viju is not in his senses at this time.

1545
01:42:47,122 --> 01:42:49,123
Yes, I am not in my senses at this time.

1546
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,377
If I were in my senses,
why would I come here?

1547
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:52,410
Viju..

1548
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:56,869
Before I lose my senses,
you go away from here.

1549
01:42:57,663 --> 01:43:01,395
I am going away from here.
But you people remember..

1550
01:43:01,702 --> 01:43:03,483
You people will have to repent one day.

1551
01:43:22,253 --> 01:43:27,943
Oh Allah..
Please help us god, please help us.

1552
01:43:32,887 --> 01:43:35,807
- Have you come, Navendu's father?
- Mother..

1553
01:43:36,389 --> 01:43:37,755
Have you come to take me?

1554
01:43:39,246 --> 01:43:42,220
- I will come right away.
- Mother.. mother..

1555
01:43:43,212 --> 01:43:44,212
Brother..

1556
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:50,410
Mother..

1557
01:43:51,312 --> 01:43:52,312
Satyen..

1558
01:43:53,285 --> 01:43:54,886
It is not Satyen, I am Navendu.

1559
01:43:58,102 --> 01:43:59,102
Satyen..

1560
01:44:00,398 --> 01:44:01,430
Remember..

1561
01:44:03,762 --> 01:44:05,872
Navendu had snatched the morsel..

1562
01:44:05,944 --> 01:44:09,976
From his children's
mouth and had fed all of us.

1563
01:44:14,598 --> 01:44:15,598
Madhavi..

1564
01:44:18,067 --> 01:44:19,067
Daughter-in-law..

1565
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:26,623
When you give children tea
instead of milk my heart is rents.

1566
01:44:29,254 --> 01:44:33,503
What? Have Navendu's
glasses not come?

1567
01:44:35,673 --> 01:44:36,815
Satyen..

1568
01:44:38,964 --> 01:44:40,724
You write to Viju in the foreign country.

1569
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:45,316
He will bring nice glasses for Navendu.

1570
01:44:46,764 --> 01:44:47,764
Satyen..

1571
01:44:49,162 --> 01:44:50,989
He has lost his job.

1572
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:54,989
My Navendu is very good.

1573
01:44:56,579 --> 01:44:59,046
He can keep his children hungry.

1574
01:45:00,452 --> 01:45:03,722
But he cannot beg anyone.

1575
01:45:05,414 --> 01:45:08,194
Promise me, Satyen. Promise me.

1576
01:45:09,747 --> 01:45:11,972
That you will look after his children.

1577
01:45:13,356 --> 01:45:14,356
Satyen..

1578
01:45:16,027 --> 01:45:17,127
Promise me..

1579
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:23,239
Mother..

1580
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:25,216
Mother.. I promise you.

1581
01:45:26,198 --> 01:45:29,016
It will happen like that, I promise you.

1582
01:45:34,051 --> 01:45:35,051
Navendu..

1583
01:45:38,502 --> 01:45:40,846
You are so unfortunate.

1584
01:45:42,311 --> 01:45:45,201
Father didn't give
you anything while leaving.

1585
01:45:46,344 --> 01:45:48,672
And even the mother
couldn't give you anything.

1586
01:46:02,973 --> 01:46:08,511
Navendu..
Come to me. Don't be afraid.

1587
01:46:09,455 --> 01:46:15,303
See. I am your new mother.
I will love you a lot.

1588
01:46:16,477 --> 01:46:18,019
Will you love me too?

1589
01:46:19,143 --> 01:46:23,040
Navendu.. Navendu.. Navendu..

1590
01:46:36,606 --> 01:46:37,742
Oh Guddi and Raju..

1591
01:46:38,879 --> 01:46:40,576
Why did you come home
so early from school?

1592
01:46:40,601 --> 01:46:43,474
Mother. The teacher
sent us back from school.

1593
01:46:43,672 --> 01:46:44,672
Why did she send you?

1594
01:46:44,697 --> 01:46:46,525
She insulted us today.

1595
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:47,978
Why?

1596
01:46:48,058 --> 01:46:50,841
You didn't pay the fees.
The headmaster called us.

1597
01:46:51,216 --> 01:46:54,323
He gave us this letter.
And sent us on a holiday.

1598
01:46:54,921 --> 01:46:56,609
It is the fees for four months, mother.

1599
01:46:56,674 --> 01:46:57,900
Yes. Therefore they sent us.

1600
01:46:58,234 --> 01:46:59,650
Bring it tomorrow.

1601
01:46:59,794 --> 01:47:01,167
Or don't come tomorrow.

1602
01:47:03,658 --> 01:47:05,194
We will send the money tomorrow.

1603
01:47:05,917 --> 01:47:06,851
Go. Go inside.

1604
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:09,599
Don't cry mother.
Otherwise it will be done.

1605
01:47:09,895 --> 01:47:11,836
It will be ruined. Come on.

1606
01:47:21,077 --> 01:47:22,769
I searched for you in so many places.

1607
01:47:23,169 --> 01:47:24,917
I went to your house, you weren't there.

1608
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:26,951
You weren't there in the college too.

1609
01:47:26,976 --> 01:47:28,364
What are you doing here all alone?

1610
01:47:28,507 --> 01:47:29,507
I was thinking..

1611
01:47:30,381 --> 01:47:31,420
What were you thinking about?

1612
01:47:31,444 --> 01:47:33,141
Just that you shouldn't meet me.

1613
01:47:33,517 --> 01:47:34,517
Why?

1614
01:47:34,837 --> 01:47:36,406
Because our roads are different.

1615
01:47:38,086 --> 01:47:39,112
I know.

1616
01:47:40,549 --> 01:47:42,557
Till the time the
situation doesn't change..

1617
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:46,295
You cannot even
think about marriage.

1618
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:49,845
It is my birthday the day after tomorrow.

1619
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:55,797
You will come and sing
in everyone's presence.

1620
01:47:58,436 --> 01:48:01,565
I am yours. I am just yours.

1621
01:48:04,982 --> 01:48:06,677
- Happy birthday..
- Happy birthday.

1622
01:48:11,837 --> 01:48:14,806
Happy birthday.. happy birthday.

1623
01:48:16,273 --> 01:48:19,004
Congratulations. Congratulations.

1624
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:23,021
You are looking so cute.

1625
01:48:23,849 --> 01:48:24,876
Congratulations.

1626
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:43,560
"There is no spring due
to the flowers in the breeze."

1627
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:56,230
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1628
01:49:01,487 --> 01:49:09,487
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1629
01:49:13,193 --> 01:49:21,193
"There is no spring due
to the flowers in the breeze."

1630
01:49:23,388 --> 01:49:31,388
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1631
01:49:46,899 --> 01:49:54,899
"I don't know when I
won't keep my word in love."

1632
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:06,720
"When I will become a
tear and fall in my own eyes."

1633
01:50:10,731 --> 01:50:18,731
"I swear to you..
I am not to be relied upon."

1634
01:50:22,327 --> 01:50:30,327
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1635
01:50:51,556 --> 01:50:57,077
"I set a new sigh in my words everyday."

1636
01:50:58,070 --> 01:51:02,891
"I wait for a new sorrow every day."

1637
01:51:03,342 --> 01:51:11,342
"I wait for a new sorrow every day."

1638
01:51:15,212 --> 01:51:23,212
"My heart doesn't
wait for any happiness."

1639
01:51:27,008 --> 01:51:35,008
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1640
01:51:56,107 --> 01:52:04,107
"How can a poor
person love the rich?"

1641
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:16,061
"Many Romeos have been
separated from their Juliet's."

1642
01:52:19,407 --> 01:52:27,407
"Nobody knows what
they are fated for."

1643
01:52:31,309 --> 01:52:39,309
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1644
01:52:42,913 --> 01:52:50,913
"There is no spring due
to the flowers in the breeze."

1645
01:52:52,885 --> 01:53:00,885
"I am not fated,
my friend, for your love."

1646
01:53:08,382 --> 01:53:09,446
Did you bring it?

1647
01:53:09,603 --> 01:53:12,507
Sister-in-law,
he refuses to give any more loan.

1648
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:14,637
What?

1649
01:53:14,717 --> 01:53:16,867
He says.. that you don't repay..

1650
01:53:17,172 --> 01:53:19,252
The previous loan
and you come to beg further.

1651
01:53:19,621 --> 01:53:21,203
He says.. he says..

1652
01:53:21,418 --> 01:53:23,130
Have we thought it
to be our father's shop?

1653
01:53:23,283 --> 01:53:24,511
How dare he!

1654
01:53:24,717 --> 01:53:27,158
Has he started abusing while managing
the prices of pulses and dough?

1655
01:53:27,182 --> 01:53:29,105
- I will teach him a lesson right away.
- No..

1656
01:53:29,911 --> 01:53:31,852
The ones who take loans don't get angry.

1657
01:53:32,888 --> 01:53:34,206
We are in need, brother.

1658
01:53:34,568 --> 01:53:36,680
We take loans, we don't beg for alms.

1659
01:53:37,185 --> 01:53:38,296
He gives goods worth ten paise..

1660
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,200
And writes twenty
five paise in the accounts.

1661
01:53:40,259 --> 01:53:42,032
Life is the name of helplessness.

1662
01:53:44,655 --> 01:53:48,033
When the situation is bad,
one has to tolerate everything.

1663
01:53:49,123 --> 01:53:51,661
Be calm. See.

1664
01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:55,645
Look, if you hide for sometime,
then everything will be all right.

1665
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:57,353
Everything will be all right.

1666
01:54:16,488 --> 01:54:19,628
Promise me, Satyen.. Promise me..

1667
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:24,993
Just like how Navendu looked after..

1668
01:54:25,328 --> 01:54:28,070
You, Geeta and Viju..

1669
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:32,555
You will look after his
children just like that too.

1670
01:54:41,935 --> 01:54:43,373
Hey.. Mr. Satyen..

1671
01:54:43,622 --> 01:54:45,595
Will you read all these books today?

1672
01:54:46,045 --> 01:54:47,511
I have studied.

1673
01:54:47,615 --> 01:54:50,528
I have brought these books to you.
Please sell them.

1674
01:54:58,943 --> 01:55:00,471
Wait.. Satyen..

1675
01:55:06,057 --> 01:55:07,657
Satyen.. what is all this?

1676
01:55:08,633 --> 01:55:11,047
Fruits and vegetables, will you buy them?

1677
01:55:11,304 --> 01:55:14,164
Wow.. the elder brother
is general a manager..

1678
01:55:14,607 --> 01:55:16,942
And the younger brother
is a vegetable vendor on the street?

1679
01:55:16,966 --> 01:55:18,076
What can be done?

1680
01:55:18,808 --> 01:55:22,414
The elder brother is God
and the younger brother is a devil.

1681
01:55:28,456 --> 01:55:29,652
Driver.. let's go home.

1682
01:55:38,707 --> 01:55:41,065
Oh Viju.. come sit down.

1683
01:55:43,347 --> 01:55:44,347
How are you?

1684
01:55:45,244 --> 01:55:46,641
I am all right till now.

1685
01:55:47,817 --> 01:55:49,854
But now whatever has
to happen will happen.

1686
01:55:51,564 --> 01:55:52,579
Why? What is the matter?

1687
01:55:53,332 --> 01:55:54,689
The matter is a small one.

1688
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:58,128
When a general manager's
brother will sell fruits..

1689
01:55:58,153 --> 01:56:00,052
And vegetables on the streets of..

1690
01:56:01,091 --> 01:56:02,762
Bombay the matter
will be very small.

1691
01:56:04,298 --> 01:56:06,776
I will be defamed, I will be insulted..

1692
01:56:08,223 --> 01:56:10,888
Maybe Satyen didn't think..

1693
01:56:11,015 --> 01:56:12,515
Satyen thinks a lot.

1694
01:56:13,327 --> 01:56:17,028
And before thinking anything,
living is necessary.

1695
01:56:17,605 --> 01:56:19,325
And earning is necessary for life.

1696
01:56:19,769 --> 01:56:22,158
But.. but this doesn't mean that..

1697
01:56:22,269 --> 01:56:23,928
One can do anything
wretched to earn money.

1698
01:56:23,952 --> 01:56:26,668
There is respect in
every earning of honesty.

1699
01:56:26,962 --> 01:56:28,692
But did you think about my respect too?

1700
01:56:28,803 --> 01:56:30,140
When the people working under me..

1701
01:56:30,164 --> 01:56:32,559
Find out that my brother
is selling fruits and vegetables..

1702
01:56:32,662 --> 01:56:34,902
- What will happen to my respect and dignity?
- Brother..

1703
01:56:35,271 --> 01:56:37,366
Even I have become selfish like you.

1704
01:56:37,451 --> 01:56:38,228
No, Satyen..

1705
01:56:38,318 --> 01:56:39,293
I don't understand.

1706
01:56:39,318 --> 01:56:42,334
If you had to do some work,
why didn't you take any job?

1707
01:56:43,335 --> 01:56:45,770
One gets money in
a job after thirty days.

1708
01:56:46,848 --> 01:56:47,848
But here..

1709
01:56:48,365 --> 01:56:51,069
Here there is a need
every morning and evening.

1710
01:56:51,558 --> 01:56:53,678
If there was a need,
why didn't you ask me for any money?

1711
01:56:53,702 --> 01:56:56,650
If we had to beg,
there is the whole world there.

1712
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,300
Why will we beg to a shameless brother?

1713
01:56:59,398 --> 01:57:00,398
Satyen..

1714
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:04,232
I have told you earlier too.
I will tell you now too.

1715
01:57:04,482 --> 01:57:06,191
I will take Satyen and Geeta to my house.

1716
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:07,763
I will take their responsibility.

1717
01:57:08,259 --> 01:57:11,109
- Doubtless. If they want to go.
- Brother.

1718
01:57:11,919 --> 01:57:13,091
You decide in between.

1719
01:57:14,116 --> 01:57:18,106
Brother, listen to
our decision too. Geeta..

1720
01:57:20,218 --> 01:57:21,218
Geeta..

1721
01:57:21,446 --> 01:57:24,401
Vijay has come to pick us up.
We will have to stay there.

1722
01:57:25,823 --> 01:57:29,001
I have just two brothers.
I am happy with them.

1723
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:31,231
Did you hear that?

1724
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:35,679
I thought that one
is arrogant due to wealth.

1725
01:57:36,897 --> 01:57:40,754
But today.. today I can
see that poverty has pride too.

1726
01:57:41,754 --> 01:57:43,575
The poor people have only this wealth.

1727
01:57:44,444 --> 01:57:46,384
Rich people like you
can never buy it out.

1728
01:58:11,298 --> 01:58:16,874
"Everyone is proud of his wife."

1729
01:58:17,049 --> 01:58:22,611
"Everyone is proud of his wife."

1730
01:58:22,919 --> 01:58:28,237
"However she is,
she is a maiden for him."

1731
01:58:28,317 --> 01:58:33,607
"Everyone is proud of his wife."

1732
01:58:48,362 --> 01:58:50,400
"The one who has a black wife.."

1733
01:58:50,559 --> 01:58:53,575
"He tells the people around.."

1734
01:58:54,107 --> 01:58:56,031
"The one who has a black wife.."

1735
01:58:56,219 --> 01:58:58,965
"He tells the people around.."

1736
01:58:59,045 --> 01:59:04,627
"He tells the people around.."

1737
01:59:04,873 --> 01:59:10,130
"Even Juliet was black,
this story is very famous."

1738
01:59:10,561 --> 01:59:16,077
"Even Juliet was black,
this story is very famous."

1739
01:59:16,142 --> 01:59:21,528
"Everyone is proud of his wife."

1740
01:59:47,165 --> 01:59:49,664
"The one who has a plump wife..

1741
01:59:49,814 --> 01:59:52,654
He goes around and tells people.."

1742
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:55,256
"The one who has a plump wife..

1743
01:59:55,486 --> 01:59:58,299
He goes around and tells people.."

1744
01:59:58,406 --> 02:00:03,998
He goes around and tells people.."

1745
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:09,772
"She is from a rich house,
she is away from all sorrows."

1746
02:00:10,012 --> 02:00:15,428
"She is from a rich house,
she is away from all sorrows."

1747
02:00:15,555 --> 02:00:20,850
"Everyone is proud of his wife."

1748
02:00:44,325 --> 02:00:46,230
"The one whose wife is short."

1749
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:49,380
"He tells the people."

1750
02:00:50,096 --> 02:00:52,040
"The one whose wife is short."

1751
02:00:52,198 --> 02:00:54,724
"He tells the people."

1752
02:00:55,057 --> 02:01:00,782
"He tells the people."

1753
02:01:00,894 --> 02:01:06,141
"She has come from a big house,
she may be short."

1754
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:12,016
"She has come from a big house,
she may be short."

1755
02:01:12,234 --> 02:01:17,594
"Everyone is proud of his wife."

1756
02:01:18,209 --> 02:01:23,293
"However she is,
she is a maiden for him."

1757
02:01:45,309 --> 02:01:46,552
Mummy..

1758
02:01:46,838 --> 02:01:48,580
Father.. father.. take this money.

1759
02:01:48,878 --> 02:01:50,145
They are a full fifteen rupees.

1760
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:51,239
Money?

1761
02:01:53,489 --> 02:01:54,629
Where did you get them from?

1762
02:01:54,741 --> 02:01:55,942
We found them on the road.

1763
02:01:56,304 --> 02:01:57,192
- Are you lying?
- Yes..

1764
02:01:57,266 --> 02:01:58,986
No, father, he is telling the truth.

1765
02:01:59,905 --> 02:02:01,136
Both of you are lying.

1766
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:03,996
Tell me the truth,
where did you get this money from?

1767
02:02:05,340 --> 02:02:07,637
We thought that we
need money for the fees.

1768
02:02:08,437 --> 02:02:10,391
We saw people earn money by singing..

1769
02:02:11,597 --> 02:02:13,520
We thought that we will
sing and earn money too.

1770
02:02:14,214 --> 02:02:17,014
The people liked the song
and fifteen rupees were collected.

1771
02:02:19,262 --> 02:02:21,838
This means that you begged, isn't it?

1772
02:02:31,305 --> 02:02:33,199
God knows what has
happened to this house.

1773
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:42,591
One doesn't do like this.
One doesn't beg.

1774
02:02:43,624 --> 02:02:45,876
Don't do like this ever. Take it.

1775
02:02:47,476 --> 02:02:48,996
Take this money and give it to mother.

1776
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:51,737
She will distribute it amongst the poor.

1777
02:02:56,208 --> 02:02:58,160
I want to help you.

1778
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,954
But I don't want money.

1779
02:03:00,275 --> 02:03:01,681
We already have such a huge loan.

1780
02:03:01,707 --> 02:03:04,137
Loan.. who is giving you a loan?

1781
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:06,520
I will give you money with this hand..

1782
02:03:06,544 --> 02:03:08,264
And I will take
the money with this hand.

1783
02:03:09,028 --> 02:03:10,028
What do you want?

1784
02:03:10,774 --> 02:03:12,160
What can I want?

1785
02:03:12,624 --> 02:03:16,814
If you wish, our friendship
can turn into a relation.

1786
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,761
- Relation?
- Yes.

1787
02:03:19,877 --> 02:03:22,946
I have money and you have the girl.

1788
02:03:23,989 --> 02:03:25,923
I didn't understand..

1789
02:03:26,105 --> 02:03:29,454
I mean.. Geeta..

1790
02:03:29,556 --> 02:03:32,285
See, Geeta is of your
grand daughter's age.

1791
02:03:32,408 --> 02:03:35,666
Why do you look at my age?
I swear to God.

1792
02:03:35,691 --> 02:03:37,650
Look at me.
I am still hale and hearty.

1793
02:03:37,926 --> 02:03:41,676
You wretch, rascal.
Get lost from my house.

1794
02:03:41,895 --> 02:03:44,036
Yes, I will go. But remember..

1795
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:46,388
You will remember this
insolence all through your life.

1796
02:03:46,413 --> 02:03:48,095
- Go.
- I am going.

1797
02:03:50,653 --> 02:03:53,332
Kali sir, go to that man
who you had loaned money too.

1798
02:03:53,512 --> 02:03:54,512
Tell me.

1799
02:03:54,644 --> 02:03:55,848
What kind of darkness is this?

1800
02:03:55,898 --> 02:03:59,160
If I go to them,
they kick me out of the house.

1801
02:03:59,476 --> 02:04:01,886
If I come to you,
I am told to go to them.

1802
02:04:02,309 --> 02:04:03,629
Don't forget.

1803
02:04:03,747 --> 02:04:05,909
I have your apartment mortgaged with me.

1804
02:04:06,125 --> 02:04:09,111
I can sell it anytime
I want and take my money.

1805
02:04:09,293 --> 02:04:10,491
Why don't you have that done?

1806
02:04:10,572 --> 02:04:12,550
Have the house auctioned
and take your money back.

1807
02:04:13,212 --> 02:04:14,212
Why do you come to me?

1808
02:04:14,885 --> 02:04:16,992
Just so that you don't tell me tomorrow..

1809
02:04:17,017 --> 02:04:19,420
That they had to leave
their house due to me.

1810
02:04:20,663 --> 02:04:24,568
This is what I want too.
They should be rendered homeless.

1811
02:04:25,171 --> 02:04:26,896
They should yearn for every paise.

1812
02:04:27,422 --> 02:04:29,135
They should beg on the streets.

1813
02:04:30,691 --> 02:04:33,258
The brother who separated a mother..

1814
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:36,873
From her son this
should be his final state.

1815
02:04:37,049 --> 02:04:41,453
Tell me. There will
be an auction on that house.

1816
02:04:42,406 --> 02:04:46,907
"There should be a good bungalow built."

1817
02:04:47,309 --> 02:04:51,413
"There should be a good bungalow built."

1818
02:04:51,918 --> 02:04:56,565
"Where we all stayed together."

1819
02:04:56,606 --> 02:05:00,535
"There should be a good bungalow built."

1820
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:05,033
"There should be a good bungalow built."

1821
02:05:05,074 --> 02:05:06,074
Uncle Khan..

1822
02:05:06,236 --> 02:05:07,236
Yes, child?

1823
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:09,249
Where are we taking
this furniture off too?

1824
02:05:10,074 --> 02:05:11,960
The furniture is old now, isn't it?

1825
02:05:12,407 --> 02:05:13,778
New furniture will be made now.

1826
02:05:13,871 --> 02:05:16,558
Uncle.. the house has become old too.

1827
02:05:17,767 --> 02:05:19,169
The house will be made new too.

1828
02:05:19,446 --> 02:05:21,351
So uncle, where will we stay?

1829
02:05:22,656 --> 02:05:24,075
With me in my house.

1830
02:05:24,966 --> 02:05:27,843
But uncle, your house is very small.

1831
02:05:29,034 --> 02:05:32,158
So what if my house is small?
My heart is very big.

1832
02:05:39,988 --> 02:05:42,751
My cycle..
Let go of my cycle. Let go!

1833
02:05:43,331 --> 02:05:44,876
Hey boy.. go away.

1834
02:05:44,901 --> 02:05:47,930
No.. if you take my cycle away,
what will I ride?

1835
02:05:48,039 --> 02:05:49,599
Didn't I tell you to go away?

1836
02:05:49,655 --> 02:05:50,935
Hey!

1837
02:05:51,332 --> 02:05:52,761
If you raise your hand on the boy..

1838
02:05:52,841 --> 02:05:55,621
I will make ten pieces
of your every bone. Leave the cycle.

1839
02:05:55,804 --> 02:05:56,639
Who are you?

1840
02:05:56,719 --> 02:05:59,541
I am the guardian of the house.
Take it away.

1841
02:06:00,747 --> 02:06:02,857
This house is to be auctioned.

1842
02:06:03,145 --> 02:06:05,059
Everything in this
house is owned by Kali.

1843
02:06:05,421 --> 02:06:07,986
This house..
This furniture will be auctioned.

1844
02:06:08,189 --> 02:06:09,767
And whatever money comes from that..

1845
02:06:10,113 --> 02:06:11,480
Will be used to repay the debt.

1846
02:06:11,505 --> 02:06:12,925
Take the cycle and keep it up.

1847
02:06:12,950 --> 02:06:13,950
Not at all.

1848
02:06:14,227 --> 02:06:18,303
If this cycle goes, then nobody
will go from here, I tell you.

1849
02:06:18,535 --> 02:06:20,059
They will call the police.

1850
02:06:20,332 --> 02:06:22,208
What about the police,
let them call the army.

1851
02:06:22,311 --> 02:06:24,924
- But this cycle will not go for the auction.
- Khan!

1852
02:06:26,523 --> 02:06:27,959
Let them do what they want to do.

1853
02:06:28,676 --> 02:06:29,873
You cannot fight the law.

1854
02:06:30,163 --> 02:06:31,966
But what kind of law is this?

1855
02:06:32,141 --> 02:06:34,880
They can take your furniture and things.

1856
02:06:35,055 --> 02:06:39,439
Why are they taking this boy's cycle?

1857
02:06:40,134 --> 02:06:42,214
If the father is the criminal,
the shadow..

1858
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:44,645
Of the crime falls on the son too.

1859
02:06:46,185 --> 02:06:50,091
Take it away.
Take the child's toy too.

1860
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:52,621
Take the vehicle away.

1861
02:07:19,566 --> 02:07:20,353
Navendu..

1862
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:22,346
Sister-in-law.. Geeta.. children.

1863
02:07:22,814 --> 02:07:24,198
Come on in - What happened, uncle?

1864
02:07:24,223 --> 02:07:26,346
Oh, at least come inside.

1865
02:07:27,073 --> 02:07:27,604
Sister-in-law..

1866
02:07:27,707 --> 02:07:29,775
Come on please..
Come brother.. come..

1867
02:08:00,653 --> 02:08:02,059
I committed a mistake.

1868
02:08:02,389 --> 02:08:04,669
There is my Allah's name
on the place of worship.

1869
02:08:05,165 --> 02:08:06,172
Is it something wrong?

1870
02:08:06,197 --> 02:08:07,197
No. Khan.

1871
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:10,188
There can't be anything better than this.

1872
02:09:45,013 --> 02:09:46,793
You want to marry me, isn't it?

1873
02:09:46,873 --> 02:09:47,873
Marriage?

1874
02:09:47,919 --> 02:09:49,786
I am dreaming about this since so long.

1875
02:09:50,661 --> 02:09:51,904
This dream can be true.

1876
02:09:52,114 --> 02:09:54,877
Oh! I will sweeten your mouth.
Tell me.

1877
02:09:54,988 --> 02:09:57,122
Tell me, when should I
take the auspicious date for?

1878
02:09:57,588 --> 02:09:59,068
But you will have
to promise me something.

1879
02:09:59,092 --> 02:10:02,625
Oh promise!
Ask my life, I will give it to you.

1880
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:05,290
Give his apartment back to elder brother.

1881
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:08,926
- And I will marry you.
- That's it?

1882
02:10:09,001 --> 02:10:10,475
Oh.. Geeta..

1883
02:10:11,516 --> 02:10:15,540
Come. Come here. It is your house.

1884
02:10:16,786 --> 02:10:19,421
You are so beautiful. Geeta, I am..

1885
02:10:19,446 --> 02:10:22,294
Dreaming of making
you my wife since so long.

1886
02:10:22,521 --> 02:10:25,394
We will marry tomorrow itself now.
You'll marry with me, isn't it!?

1887
02:10:25,792 --> 02:10:28,575
Yes.. but.. return the
documents of the house first.

1888
02:10:28,607 --> 02:10:29,858
Oh! What about documents..

1889
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,712
This apartment,
that apartment, everything is yours.

1890
02:10:32,953 --> 02:10:34,924
We will marry tomorrow.
Geeta.. why not today..

1891
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:38,499
- Why not today..
- No.. No.. What are you doing?

1892
02:10:38,709 --> 02:10:40,619
Let me go! Let me go!

1893
02:10:40,644 --> 02:10:41,958
Save me! Save me!

1894
02:10:42,114 --> 02:10:43,114
You wretch!

1895
02:10:43,424 --> 02:10:46,598
You want to molest a poor girl?

1896
02:10:50,255 --> 02:10:54,682
Tell me, what were you doing?
What were you doing?

1897
02:10:55,184 --> 02:10:59,420
You didn't find any other house?
You got our house to do this?

1898
02:10:59,927 --> 02:11:01,226
Please let him go, brother.

1899
02:11:01,362 --> 02:11:03,204
You remember your devil now.

1900
02:11:03,411 --> 02:11:05,119
Because once you go to your devil..

1901
02:11:05,152 --> 02:11:07,219
You will never come
back in this world then.

1902
02:11:07,291 --> 02:11:09,383
Brother.. Please let him go.

1903
02:11:09,596 --> 02:11:13,759
Let him go..let him go.

1904
02:11:13,901 --> 02:11:15,717
For my sake.

1905
02:11:18,798 --> 02:11:19,798
Get up.

1906
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,520
See.

1907
02:11:22,819 --> 02:11:24,015
You animal.

1908
02:11:24,453 --> 02:11:28,401
The girl whom you wanted to molest,
she is saving your life.

1909
02:11:29,087 --> 02:11:31,642
Fall to her feet and pray to her.

1910
02:11:32,227 --> 02:11:34,810
This is the question
of our family's dignity.

1911
02:11:35,889 --> 02:11:37,785
Please save our house
from being auctioned.

1912
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:40,793
So what if there is nothing else..

1913
02:11:40,873 --> 02:11:42,753
Between the walls
of that dilapidated house..

1914
02:11:43,238 --> 02:11:46,150
It houses the respect
and dignity of our ancestors.

1915
02:11:46,411 --> 02:11:47,910
You are telling this today.

1916
02:11:48,243 --> 02:11:50,238
Today, when you have come on the streets.

1917
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:53,872
But why didn't you think
about this when you were at home?

1918
02:11:56,099 --> 02:11:57,645
And how would you think about it?

1919
02:11:58,237 --> 02:12:00,155
You were the owner of
the house till yesterday.

1920
02:12:01,138 --> 02:12:03,412
I was a servant in that house.

1921
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:06,593
And even today,
I am a servant in that house.

1922
02:12:06,763 --> 02:12:09,306
The servant of one house can become..

1923
02:12:09,338 --> 02:12:11,111
A servant in some other house too.

1924
02:12:13,036 --> 02:12:14,716
Don't be so hard hearted.

1925
02:12:15,185 --> 02:12:16,566
You have a house too.

1926
02:12:16,972 --> 02:12:19,688
God forbid.. if your
house was in such a state too?

1927
02:12:19,768 --> 02:12:21,723
Sister-in-law..
Think what you are talking about.

1928
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:24,166
You are standing in my
house and cursing my house?

1929
02:12:24,638 --> 02:12:28,296
Please forgive me. Please forgive me.

1930
02:12:29,103 --> 02:12:31,919
I don't know what all I said.
I am not in my senses.

1931
02:12:33,193 --> 02:12:36,278
Please fulfill my desire,
I will go away from here.

1932
02:12:36,677 --> 02:12:40,163
- I fall at your feet.
- Sister-in-law! What are you doing?

1933
02:12:40,979 --> 02:12:44,635
Your pure hands are not
to touch these impure feet.

1934
02:12:44,715 --> 02:12:45,715
Satyen..

1935
02:12:46,943 --> 02:12:48,821
- What are you saying?
- I am right.

1936
02:12:49,474 --> 02:12:51,278
The woman doesn't
have love in her heart..

1937
02:12:51,358 --> 02:12:54,005
She is useless like a barren land.

1938
02:12:54,085 --> 02:12:55,085
Satyen..

1939
02:12:56,903 --> 02:12:57,903
Brother..

1940
02:12:58,194 --> 02:13:00,063
I am ashamed of your honesty.

1941
02:13:00,807 --> 02:13:02,949
Mother was ashamed to
call you her son yesterday.

1942
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:05,179
And today,
I am ashamed to call you my brother.

1943
02:13:05,308 --> 02:13:07,190
Please be silent, brother, please..

1944
02:13:07,289 --> 02:13:10,419
I have been silent till today.
But I cannot stay silent today.

1945
02:13:10,789 --> 02:13:12,340
If they have got some money, they..

1946
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:14,206
Have forgotten that brother who..

1947
02:13:14,231 --> 02:13:15,975
Brought them up like their father.

1948
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,998
And made them able to
live in this world with pride.

1949
02:13:20,778 --> 02:13:22,052
What do you want to say?

1950
02:13:22,732 --> 02:13:24,038
You know it very well.

1951
02:13:24,570 --> 02:13:26,319
Elder brother starved and thirsted.

1952
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:28,898
His innocent children kept crying.

1953
02:13:29,433 --> 02:13:31,681
Sister-in-law shed
tears all her life.

1954
02:13:32,022 --> 02:13:34,832
But for your future
and your further studies..

1955
02:13:34,857 --> 02:13:36,661
He never thought
or cared about anyone.

1956
02:13:37,208 --> 02:13:39,547
He mortgaged his house and took a loan.

1957
02:13:40,091 --> 02:13:43,076
But he didn't even buy a
handful of grain from that money.

1958
02:13:43,301 --> 02:13:46,318
So that you shouldn't starve.
His whole life..

1959
02:13:46,763 --> 02:13:48,845
He spent his whole
life in a tattered dhotie.

1960
02:13:49,143 --> 02:13:51,100
So that you should wear expensive suits.

1961
02:13:51,125 --> 02:13:53,888
That's enough. That's enough brother.

1962
02:13:54,349 --> 02:13:56,860
There is a lot to be said yet,
sister-in-law.

1963
02:13:57,684 --> 02:14:00,333
Today when brother doesn't
have that strength..

1964
02:14:00,629 --> 02:14:02,413
And his eyes don't
have that brightness..

1965
02:14:02,743 --> 02:14:04,812
You have left him today, so that..

1966
02:14:04,846 --> 02:14:07,082
He writes on the streets and dies?

1967
02:14:07,795 --> 02:14:10,729
- Fie on you.
- Stop your rubbish.

1968
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:13,500
This is not rubbish.
This is the truth.

1969
02:14:13,848 --> 02:14:14,848
Satyen..

1970
02:14:14,974 --> 02:14:17,247
You are fighting with your
brother for your step brother?

1971
02:14:17,281 --> 02:14:20,082
I don't know who is a
step brother or a real brother.

1972
02:14:20,272 --> 02:14:23,349
I just know that one can
get a woman like you again.

1973
02:14:23,435 --> 02:14:24,055
Satyen..

1974
02:14:24,135 --> 02:14:25,046
Silent, Satyen.

1975
02:14:25,126 --> 02:14:26,536
But one gets a brother like Rama..

1976
02:14:26,769 --> 02:14:29,672
And a sister-in-law
like Sita just once in life.

1977
02:14:29,976 --> 02:14:33,896
Satyen..
For my sake, please be silent.

1978
02:14:37,656 --> 02:14:39,768
Come on, sister-in-law. Come on.

1979
02:14:40,587 --> 02:14:43,027
In a house, where the
man is a slave of the woman..

1980
02:14:43,459 --> 02:14:45,766
It is a sin to even
breathe in that house.

1981
02:14:46,856 --> 02:14:48,282
You call me a slave to a woman?

1982
02:14:48,555 --> 02:14:49,719
Aren't you ashamed?

1983
02:14:55,411 --> 02:14:56,671
Come on, sister-in-law.

1984
02:15:05,708 --> 02:15:08,119
This way, sister-in-law. Wait here.

1985
02:15:08,974 --> 02:15:10,800
I will settle the
account of this damn guy.

1986
02:15:12,475 --> 02:15:14,056
You call me a damn guy?

1987
02:15:14,336 --> 02:15:16,577
If you were a man,
you wouldn't attack me from behind.

1988
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:20,813
This is something like a man.

1989
02:15:22,474 --> 02:15:23,606
Open the door, Satyen.

1990
02:15:23,753 --> 02:15:26,742
Aren't you ashamed to raise
your hand on your elder brother?

1991
02:15:35,819 --> 02:15:37,136
Open the door, Satyen.

1992
02:16:00,284 --> 02:16:01,715
Satyen.. open the door.

1993
02:16:05,747 --> 02:16:06,747
Get up.

1994
02:16:14,944 --> 02:16:16,838
Enough Satyen, my brother, enough.

1995
02:16:59,735 --> 02:17:02,453
Hello? Doctor Verma.

1996
02:17:03,371 --> 02:17:05,790
I am Neela. Please come here quickly.

1997
02:17:33,251 --> 02:17:35,737
Please go out. Please.

1998
02:17:43,218 --> 02:17:45,097
- Nurse.. put him on oxygen.
- Yes, sir.

1999
02:17:49,368 --> 02:17:50,368
Doctor..

2000
02:17:51,815 --> 02:17:52,815
Doctor..

2001
02:17:53,414 --> 02:17:54,821
My brother will live, isn't it?

2002
02:17:55,016 --> 02:17:56,762
See. He is in a critical state.

2003
02:17:57,446 --> 02:17:59,131
Maybe, he will have to be operated upon.

2004
02:17:59,273 --> 02:18:01,521
It will be decided when
the senior doctor comes.

2005
02:18:01,837 --> 02:18:03,399
He must be arriving right away.

2006
02:18:11,009 --> 02:18:13,963
Hello. Bandra police station.

2007
02:18:14,938 --> 02:18:18,524
I am Dr. Mathur, from Nanavati hospital.

2008
02:18:19,838 --> 02:18:23,790
I want to report a case.
Concussion of the skull.

2009
02:18:25,147 --> 02:18:27,301
Yes. It is very serious.

2010
02:18:28,415 --> 02:18:30,252
The people who brought him here are here.

2011
02:18:30,699 --> 02:18:33,409
Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you.

2012
02:18:39,574 --> 02:18:41,878
Please listen. Come here.

2013
02:18:45,571 --> 02:18:47,011
The matter has worsened.

2014
02:18:47,153 --> 02:18:48,820
I think that before the police arrives..

2015
02:18:49,048 --> 02:18:52,049
- We should call our lawyer.
- Yes.

2016
02:19:02,545 --> 02:19:04,261
Doctor.. has the operation completed?

2017
02:19:04,504 --> 02:19:05,172
Yes.

2018
02:19:05,281 --> 02:19:06,864
I want to take his statement.

2019
02:19:07,136 --> 02:19:08,610
You cannot take his
statement at this time.

2020
02:19:08,634 --> 02:19:10,019
In what state is Satyen in?

2021
02:19:10,044 --> 02:19:11,735
He has been taken
to the operation theatre.

2022
02:19:11,907 --> 02:19:14,292
This means that the case is serious.

2023
02:19:14,465 --> 02:19:15,687
What should we do now?

2024
02:19:15,767 --> 02:19:17,886
We will have to wait and see,
Mrs. Gupta.

2025
02:19:18,906 --> 02:19:22,283
But sir, what is the legal implication?

2026
02:19:22,639 --> 02:19:24,428
You are responsible for that.

2027
02:19:25,075 --> 02:19:27,459
If Satyen survives and
says that you have hit him..

2028
02:19:27,522 --> 02:19:31,124
Then you will held
guilty under the IPC 325.

2029
02:19:31,754 --> 02:19:34,707
And you will be in prison
for five to six months.

2030
02:19:35,811 --> 02:19:37,205
And if..

2031
02:19:37,496 --> 02:19:38,589
What about if?

2032
02:19:38,958 --> 02:19:42,813
If Satyen is killed, you
will be held guilty under IPC 307.

2033
02:19:43,373 --> 02:19:47,177
And under that, you will be
imprisoned for five or seven years.

2034
02:19:47,770 --> 02:19:52,885
This means that our
life is in Satyen's hands.

2035
02:19:53,341 --> 02:19:55,174
Then it is impossible for us to survive.

2036
02:19:55,597 --> 02:19:57,633
Satyen won't rest unless
he sends us to jail.

2037
02:19:58,915 --> 02:20:01,375
Please, save us.

2038
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:05,868
I am sorry, inspector. My
client won't give any statement here.

2039
02:20:06,634 --> 02:20:08,836
Whatever statements have to be given,
I will give them.

2040
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:11,019
But not here, in the court.

2041
02:20:12,763 --> 02:20:14,445
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

2042
02:20:30,125 --> 02:20:32,587
How is Satyen?

2043
02:20:33,902 --> 02:20:35,439
He is unconscious as yet.

2044
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:37,622
He may have to be operated.

2045
02:20:40,281 --> 02:20:42,005
God knows what will happen now?

2046
02:20:43,269 --> 02:20:45,358
When we are ill fated, what can we do?

2047
02:20:46,149 --> 02:20:50,849
But tell me. How did this
happen when you were here?

2048
02:20:50,947 --> 02:20:54,702
What could I do?
Satyen locked me in a room.

2049
02:20:55,149 --> 02:20:58,195
And they were fighting outside,
the both of them.

2050
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:04,375
I knocked a lot.
But nobody listened to me.

2051
02:21:05,545 --> 02:21:08,349
There was such fighting..
Such fighting..

2052
02:21:09,470 --> 02:21:11,368
Satyen is temperamental.

2053
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:14,554
But even an enemy doesn't hit like this.

2054
02:21:18,118 --> 02:21:19,913
I had so many dreams for Viju.

2055
02:21:21,096 --> 02:21:22,994
What all did I not do for Viju?

2056
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:25,890
He should study and become successful.

2057
02:21:26,650 --> 02:21:30,707
He should have nice concepts
and be respected and famous.

2058
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:36,654
He put my years of penance
into dust in a moment.

2059
02:21:40,307 --> 02:21:42,844
I tried so much that the respect
of the house should be there.

2060
02:21:44,478 --> 02:21:46,597
But this brother of mine defeated me.

2061
02:21:55,181 --> 02:21:59,865
Sister-in-law..
Satyen.. how is Satyen?

2062
02:22:01,195 --> 02:22:02,786
Everything is in the hands of the Lord.

2063
02:22:02,886 --> 02:22:05,914
Daughter.. we are ill fated.

2064
02:22:07,612 --> 02:22:12,695
We just have to see how lucky we are.

2065
02:22:15,649 --> 02:22:16,899
Sister-in-law..

2066
02:22:44,024 --> 02:22:45,024
Brother..

2067
02:22:47,563 --> 02:22:49,256
Oh Viju.. you fool.

2068
02:22:49,891 --> 02:22:52,059
What problem did you put yourself in?

2069
02:22:54,158 --> 02:23:00,198
Brother..
You are still thinking about me?

2070
02:23:00,565 --> 02:23:01,671
What can I do?

2071
02:23:02,441 --> 02:23:04,998
How can I forget what
I have done all my life?

2072
02:23:07,832 --> 02:23:12,285
Brother..
I am not worthy of your love.

2073
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:20,009
I'm not naīve. I did everything
whatever I didn't have to do.

2074
02:23:20,641 --> 02:23:22,162
And yet, you aren't angry with me?

2075
02:23:22,516 --> 02:23:25,251
Brother..
Why don't you beat me and insult me?

2076
02:23:25,386 --> 02:23:27,783
Why don't you break my face?

2077
02:23:28,361 --> 02:23:29,361
Viju..

2078
02:23:30,578 --> 02:23:33,868
If the teeth bite the tongue,
one doesn't break his teeth.

2079
02:23:37,232 --> 02:23:40,385
See, Vijay has come back.

2080
02:23:47,073 --> 02:23:48,269
This police.. for you?

2081
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:52,467
- Did you give any statement?
- No.

2082
02:23:58,251 --> 02:24:00,883
Excuse me, have you come in this matter?

2083
02:24:01,271 --> 02:24:02,068
But who are you?

2084
02:24:02,093 --> 02:24:04,698
I am Navendu Prasad Gupta.

2085
02:24:06,428 --> 02:24:10,632
The boy who has been hurt..
Is my brother.. younger brother.

2086
02:24:12,298 --> 02:24:13,768
Actually, he is my step brother.

2087
02:24:16,198 --> 02:24:19,979
We have an ancestral house.
He used to ask his share in it.

2088
02:24:21,098 --> 02:24:26,538
I didn't like it.
One day, we argued and had a scuffle.

2089
02:24:27,145 --> 02:24:30,895
I took something and hit
him on the head by mistake.

2090
02:24:30,928 --> 02:24:35,337
No.. no..
This is wrong. This is lies.

2091
02:24:39,084 --> 02:24:40,691
Are you all right?

2092
02:24:42,563 --> 02:24:43,713
What do you mean?

2093
02:24:44,119 --> 02:24:48,755
When the elder brother
is taking our crime on his head..

2094
02:24:54,161 --> 02:24:55,310
What are you thinking?

2095
02:24:57,495 --> 02:25:04,827
You mean, that he should go
to prison and we should be silent?

2096
02:25:05,327 --> 02:25:06,732
This is the best chance.

2097
02:25:08,497 --> 02:25:12,019
The everyday fights will be done with.

2098
02:25:13,063 --> 02:25:16,494
One is ready to die and
the other is ready for prison.

2099
02:25:17,702 --> 02:25:20,100
Take advantage of their stupidity.

2100
02:25:21,517 --> 02:25:24,684
The cane will break
and the snake will die too.

2101
02:25:32,295 --> 02:25:35,339
Shameless. Low woman.

2102
02:25:39,425 --> 02:25:40,425
Viju..

2103
02:25:40,977 --> 02:25:42,050
What insolence is this?

2104
02:25:42,516 --> 02:25:46,823
Don't meddle, brother.
She is not a woman, she is a snake.

2105
02:25:47,161 --> 02:25:50,882
Silent, whatever Neela is,
she is your wife.

2106
02:25:52,370 --> 02:25:54,460
My eyes have opened today.

2107
02:25:55,470 --> 02:25:58,999
The curtains on my mind have been undone.

2108
02:25:59,945 --> 02:26:02,014
She is not a woman, she is a witch.

2109
02:26:02,696 --> 02:26:05,187
She separated me from my blood.

2110
02:26:05,598 --> 02:26:06,598
Viju..

2111
02:26:06,655 --> 02:26:09,492
The one who repeats the
things of the past is immature.

2112
02:26:10,321 --> 02:26:17,868
Brother.. what all you didn't
do for me. I can't tell you.

2113
02:26:19,653 --> 02:26:20,753
I just know..

2114
02:26:22,244 --> 02:26:26,093
That if I make shoes out of my
skin and make these feet wear them..

2115
02:26:27,352 --> 02:26:30,215
- Even then I cannot repay your gratitude.
- Silent..

2116
02:26:31,952 --> 02:26:36,191
But now.. not any longer, brother.
Not any longer.

2117
02:26:36,558 --> 02:26:39,284
- Inspector..
- Viju. -I have hit Satyen..

2118
02:26:39,468 --> 02:26:41,721
No.. for my sake..

2119
02:26:46,686 --> 02:26:48,322
Congratulations to all of you.

2120
02:26:49,876 --> 02:26:51,184
Congratulations.

2121
02:26:51,393 --> 02:26:54,959
Mr. Satyen didn't
have any internal wounds.

2122
02:26:55,341 --> 02:26:57,123
And doctor.. the operation..

2123
02:26:57,175 --> 02:26:59,320
That wasn't needed
and won't be needed too.

2124
02:26:59,424 --> 02:27:02,888
- Where is he? - He is inside.
- Can we see him? - Of course.

2125
02:27:03,563 --> 02:27:04,763
Just a minute.

2126
02:27:05,684 --> 02:27:09,474
Forgive me. Doctor.. till
the time I don't take his statement..

2127
02:27:10,377 --> 02:27:12,477
Nobody from them can meet him.

2128
02:27:12,763 --> 02:27:13,763
Oh! I see.

2129
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:18,448
Please come out for a minute,
if you don't mind. Come with me.

2130
02:27:21,305 --> 02:27:22,305
Oh God!

2131
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:26,230
What if Satyen says
anything wrong in anger?

2132
02:27:26,644 --> 02:27:29,857
Don't worry. Satyen is temperamental.

2133
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:32,093
But he is our brother after all.

2134
02:27:32,901 --> 02:27:34,407
I am sorry for the trouble.

2135
02:27:35,383 --> 02:27:38,641
But can I ask you how you got this wound?

2136
02:27:39,532 --> 02:27:40,328
Yes?

2137
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:42,858
I want to know who hit you.

2138
02:28:04,391 --> 02:28:06,616
You have some misconception, inspector.

2139
02:28:07,999 --> 02:28:09,214
Nobody hit me.

2140
02:28:10,567 --> 02:28:11,919
Then this wound..

2141
02:28:12,375 --> 02:28:13,375
That..

2142
02:28:16,906 --> 02:28:21,114
I was getting down from the stairs,
I slipped and fell down.

2143
02:28:22,350 --> 02:28:24,326
Are you telling the truth?

2144
02:28:26,383 --> 02:28:27,983
I am saying the truth.

2145
02:28:29,952 --> 02:28:30,952
Okay.

2146
02:28:32,842 --> 02:28:33,846
Didn't I tell you?

2147
02:28:34,746 --> 02:28:38,000
Satyen is temperamental.
But he is our brother.

2148
02:28:40,993 --> 02:28:44,419
Brother.. brother..
Please forgive me.

2149
02:28:45,445 --> 02:28:47,205
I haven't walked on the road of good.

2150
02:28:47,682 --> 02:28:49,666
I have just walked on
the road of my own needs.

2151
02:28:50,506 --> 02:28:52,271
Now, I will walk on your road.

2152
02:28:53,251 --> 02:28:54,760
Please give me place in your feet.

2153
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:57,174
No, daughter-in-law. Get up..

2154
02:28:58,242 --> 02:29:02,143
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made.."

2155
02:29:02,168 --> 02:29:06,419
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made.."

2156
02:29:06,967 --> 02:29:11,587
"All my family members
should live in it."

2157
02:29:11,932 --> 02:29:15,935
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made.."

2158
02:29:16,605 --> 02:29:20,305
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made.."

2159
02:29:21,933 --> 02:29:26,356
"The bungalow of gold,
a settlement of silver.."

2160
02:29:26,883 --> 02:29:31,102
"The bungalow of gold,
a settlement of silver.."

2161
02:29:31,609 --> 02:29:35,657
"It demands for a whole bed."

2162
02:29:36,124 --> 02:29:39,595
"It demands for a whole bed."

2163
02:29:40,008 --> 02:29:44,375
"A beautiful and good bungalow."

2164
02:29:44,742 --> 02:29:52,337
"A beautiful bungalow
should be made.."

2165
02:29:52,818 --> 02:29:53,818
Father..

2166
02:29:54,552 --> 02:29:56,459
If only you could see
it with your own eyes.

2167
02:29:57,568 --> 02:30:00,671
There is no one who is step today.

2168
02:30:00,969 --> 02:30:06,032
"The Bindiya (forehead dot) will shine,
the garland will be aromatic.."

2169
02:30:06,844 --> 02:30:11,895
"Whether you don't
get sleep or you get it."

2170
02:30:12,218 --> 02:30:17,488
"The collyrium will radiate and
the flowers will exude a fragrance."

2171
02:30:18,033 --> 02:30:23,347
"The collyrium will radiate and
the flowers will exude a fragrance."

2172
02:30:23,875 --> 02:30:29,074
"No matter if he
gets annoyed with me."

2173
02:30:29,358 --> 02:30:33,867
"The Bindiya (forehead dot) will shine,
the garland will be aromatic.."
