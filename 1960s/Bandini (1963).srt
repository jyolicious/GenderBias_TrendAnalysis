1
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,000
Sir, five female prisoners..

2
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
..have been transferred
here from Jabalpur prison.

3
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,600
Tulsi!

4
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,800
Zubeida Bano!

5
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,320
Kalyani!

6
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,680
Jamuna!

7
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,000
Sukhiya!

8
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,840
Sir!

9
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,760
Who's it?
- This is Mahabal Singh!

10
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,520
Greetings!
- What's the matter?

11
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,760
There's some noise in the female ward.

12
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,920
Is it?
- Yes.

13
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
Wait, I'll get the key.

14
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,000
We can't live here anymore!
Open the door!

15
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,440
Let us out!
- Quiet!

16
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,320
Why can't you live here?

17
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,120
We're scared of blood!
- Stop!

18
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,200
Stop!

19
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Open the door!

20
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,440
Quiet! The jailor's here!

21
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,840
The jailor's here!

22
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,800
Greetings, sir.

23
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,080
The constable told me
that someone's ill. - Yes.

24
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,440
The old woman Ramdai
vomited blood twice.

25
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
That's why the rest of
the women are very scared.

26
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,520
The doctor's here.

27
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm sorry for being late.

28
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
Who's ill?
- Prisoner no. 8, Ramdai.

29
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Today she vomited
blood while coughing.

30
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,240
Blood?
- Yes.

31
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,840
Come, Devendradra, let's take a look.
- What'll you do in there?

32
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
I'll go alone.
- Hurry up.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
If I stand here for long,

34
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,480
then even I'll have to be
admitted in your hospital!

35
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Everyone leave.

36
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,400
I won't survive now, doctor.
- Shut up!

37
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,400
Were you ill for a few
nights previously? - Yes.

38
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,840
I'm very thirsty.

39
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,600
Get water.

40
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

41
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,040
What's wrong with her?
- She's suffering from tuberculosis.

42
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,680
She'll have to be sent
to the hospital ward.

43
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,920
Fine. The female hospital is empty.

44
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
But we'll need a nurse too.

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,840
Warden.
- Yes.

46
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
Just inquire if anyone of
them is ready to serve her.

47
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,400
Who'd like to be with that old woman?

48
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,080
They all are so scared after
seeing her vomiting blood.

49
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,360
Ask them.
- As you say.

50
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,840
Is anyone of you
ready to be with Ramdai?

51
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,800
Why are you quiet?

52
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm ready.

53
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
But she can't be with her.
- Why?

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
It's contagious.

55
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,160
And at this age, the tuberculosis
viruses spread very easily.

56
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
I don't care, doctor.

57
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,200
Don't worry about me.

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
Sir, just order me.

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
I'll be able to serve her very well.

60
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,640
Strange girl! She's come
here just a few days ago,

61
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
but she's friendly with everyone.

62
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Here's my ticket. Write the order.

63
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,000
You might forget tomorrow.

64
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Is this the time for
sir to write things?

65
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,440
Doctor, pen please.

66
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh, God! Look at her audacity!

67
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,640
She was talking to the jailor as
if she's related to him! - Shut up!

68
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,120
Stop your nonsense! Go to your places!

69
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,760
1, 2, 3, 4, 5..

70
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,680
Why were you so shocked on
seeing that girl's card?

71
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,400
I was shocked to see the
accusation on that girl.

72
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,240
She's a murderer.

73
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,040
She poisoned someone.

74
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,440
And today she wants
to save someone else.

75
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,840
You know, the holy scriptures say..

76
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,920
..that even God can't
predict the character of women..

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,720
..and the destiny of men.

78
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,320
Then who are we?

79
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,960
I don't know about
the holy scriptures.

80
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,000
But I feel that if one
commits a crime once..

81
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,640
..that doesn't brand
him a criminal forever.

82
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,200
Why've you brought this bed?
- Doctor has sent it.

83
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,720
We're are slogging here..

84
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,280
..and Kalyani is sleeping
peacefully at the hospital!

85
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,160
Why are you jealous now?

86
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,520
Everyone was quiet
when the warden asked..

87
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
..you to look after that old woman!

88
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,720
Why are you feeling offended?

89
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,360
She still has high fever.

90
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,920
We'll have to take her to the
hospital tomorrow, for the X-ray.

91
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,200
You keep her ready.

92
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Doctor, why did you send
another bed for the patient?

93
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,600
For you.

94
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,400
No. I don't need it.

95
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,400
I'll sleep on the floor.

96
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,840
Look, it's the prison rule that..

97
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,520
..everyone gets what they deserve.

98
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Even if they don't want.

99
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm an ordinary prisoner.

100
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,600
I'm here to serve the
punishment of my mistake.

101
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
I deserve only 3
blankets and a mattress.

102
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,000
Even I've some duties being a doctor.

103
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,080
And I did everything
to fulfill my duty.

104
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,720
Listen.

105
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,560
What happened?

106
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm just a C-class prisoner.

107
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,240
Jailors and policemen
don't talk to me politely.

108
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,360
Why are you talking to me so politely?

109
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,920
I'm newly appointed in the prison.

110
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,400
So I couldn't learn its customs.

111
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,840
And I don't believe that one should
talk impolitely with C-class prisoners.

112
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,920
Number 12, Deputy
Mahesh is calling you.

113
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,160
Where..
- Next to the tap.

114
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,640
Why are you standing there? Come here.

115
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,120
How's your patient now?

116
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,520
She has very high fever.

117
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,360
I see.

118
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,080
Yes, after inquiring, I found
out that your case isn't true.

119
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,760
I also consulted a lawyer.

120
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,240
If I could know something else
from you.. - Thank you very much.

121
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
The case isn't false.

122
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,560
I wonder why the doctor
appointed you at the hospital.

123
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,200
It's dangerous for you to
serve a tuberculosis patient.

124
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
I took up this duty willingly.

125
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
Kalyani.

126
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,360
You forgot your ticket
at the ward yesterday.

127
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,360
Here. Keep it with you carefully.

128
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,040
How's that old woman?

129
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll take a look.

130
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,480
Both the lungs are infected.

131
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,280
But I'm sure I'll cure her quickly.

132
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll start giving her booster
shots from tomorrow.

133
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,440
Doctor.

134
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,520
The good news is that Ramdai
slept peacefully at night.

135
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,680
And she was fine in the morning.

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
You saved that poor lady.

137
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,840
I won't accept the entire
credit for saving her life.

138
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
You looked after her all day.

139
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,280
Nursing is the best
remedy for this ailment.

140
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,720
Ramdai, are you fine now?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
Let me check the temperature.

142
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,240
Should I keep resting even now?

143
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
No, go for walks.

144
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,400
But beware of the monsoon winds.

145
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,880
Kalyani.

146
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
Kalyani.

147
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,400
Listen.

148
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Yes.

149
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,000
You look beautiful when
you're engrossed in work.

150
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,320
How long will Ramdai
keep her mouth shut?

151
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,240
Oh.

152
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:14,720
"O sweet little bird, what're you
chirping in the morning? Tell me."

153
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,040
"What're you chirping?"

154
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:27,560
"O sweet little bird, what're you
chirping in the morning? Tell me"

155
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
"What're you chirping?"

156
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:53,760
"I'm a mynah who lives in the cage.
My wings are useless."

157
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:02,200
"There's a big gap between us.
How should I come to you?"

158
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,920
"How should I come to you?"

159
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:15,600
"O sweet little bird, what're you
chirping in the morning? Tell me.

160
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,560
"What're you chirping?"

161
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:41,360
"It's the spring. The garden is
blooming. The mango trees are lush."

162
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:49,680
"I peep through the window.
Spring has arrived."

163
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,000
"Spring has arrived."

164
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,920
"O sweet little bird, what're you
chirping in the morning? Tell me."

165
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,680
"What're you chirping?"

166
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,760
Number 7? I just went to the
kitchen and you started singing!

167
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,680
Madam, I'm in a good
mood today. - I get that.

168
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,600
But the prison rule is to keep
your mouth shut, whatever the mood!

169
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,680
From tomorrow, you'll have
to grind those lentils again!

170
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
Sir, give some
medicines to Kalyani too.

171
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,360
She couldn't sleep in
the night, due to headache.

172
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,840
What happened to you?

173
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,440
Nothing. I caught a cold.

174
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,640
You shouldn't be careless about
your health. Let me check your pulse.

175
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,840
What a taste! Romancing a criminal!

176
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,280
You're educated, a doctor,
have a nice job.

177
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,920
Maintaining family's
dignity's also important.

178
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,160
Brother, this is called love!

179
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,120
"Love doesn't
distinguish between religions."

180
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,360
"When you're hungry, you
don't mind even soiled dishes."

181
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,720
"Love doesn't
distinguish between religions."

182
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,000
"When you're hungry, you
don't mind even soiled dishes."

183
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,040
What's the use if one
doesn't become blind in love?

184
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,160
Softly! He's coming!

185
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,040
He looks like Romeo!

186
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,280
This is not a place to romance,
but its prison!

187
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,480
If you want to do this, then go out.

188
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,160
Oh God! Don't you've any other topic?

189
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,440
The deputy jailor has gone to the
jailor to talk about this matter.

190
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,920
Be patient till then.

191
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Kalyani, what are you doing here?

192
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,840
The doctor has sent special
food for you at the hospital!

193
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,040
Rich food!

194
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,200
She's so lucky!

195
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,080
Eggs and butter along
with chapatti! Great!

196
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,920
Oh my, I'm such a fool!

197
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,720
Had I served that old woman,
then even I would've enjoyed now!

198
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,200
And you would've
trapped some young man too!

199
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
Doctor.

200
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
Why did you send special food for me?

201
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,360
Are all those, who serve
tuberculosis patients in hospitals..

202
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,600
..served special food?

203
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,720
I don't know about others,
but this is the rule here.

204
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,360
But do I need this diet, or
are you doing a favor to me?

205
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,720
No. You do need it.

206
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Can I ask you something Kalyani?
- Yes.

207
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,520
Why did you risk your life,
serving a tuberculosis patient?

208
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,560
Whatever the reason might be..

209
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,480
..but I won't let you
commit suicide here.

210
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,560
Why do you want to save a
downtrodden girl like me?

211
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,120
Do you know why I'm
serving this punishment?

212
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,160
I know.

213
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,080
You still want to save me?
- Yes.

214
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,840
Don't ruin your future,
repenting for your past.

215
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,680
How'll you benefit by this?
- Benefit?

216
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,640
In no way. Is profit and
loss everything in life?

217
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,520
Don't you feel
anything more than this?

218
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,040
The danger signal.

219
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
C'mon!

220
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,240
Long live!
- Revolution!

221
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,240
Long live!
- Revolution!

222
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
Hail Hanuman! Ocean
of wisdom! Protect us.

223
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,360
The emissary of Ram, very strong!
- What's it?

224
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,640
Those revolutionaries have
created havoc again! Oh god!

225
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,320
What's this danger signal for, Warden?

226
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,680
From the time the freedom
fighters have come to this prison..

227
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
..there's no peace!

228
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,840
They do something or the other!

229
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,240
Today Vinay Ghosh
slapped our deputy jailor!

230
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,400
Go back to your places!

231
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,520
19, 20, 21, 22, 23!

232
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,960
All's well!

233
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,800
All's well!

234
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,520
What's the matter, Kamla?
- Nothing.

235
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,040
I'll grind it. Ramdai is
fine now. I've no work there.

236
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,240
Move aside.

237
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Kamla, if doctor comes to know,
he won't spare you!

238
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,800
What've you to do with that?

239
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
Shut up! Don't talk nonsense!
- You're talking nonsense!

240
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,280
No, Kamla.
- No!

241
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,080
It's enough of this daily nonsense!

242
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,600
Wonder what she thinks of herself!
What will you do?

243
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
Taunt again and see.
- I will!

244
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,720
Shut up, you dusky!
- What did you say?

245
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,960
I won't spare you!
- Leave me!

246
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
Kamla! Kamla!

247
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,720
I'll show you.

248
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,440
Leave. - Stop.

249
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,120
No!
- Kamla!

250
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,320
Murder!
- Quiet!

251
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,800
As soon as I disappeared,
you created havoc here!

252
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,720
I'll complain about each
one of you to the jailor!

253
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,760
I've noticed that you disappear
as soon as the doctor arrives!

254
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,560
Yesterday doctor was
asking me about you.

255
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm right near the tap.

256
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,640
Hello sir.
- Hello.

257
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,440
Where's your nurse?

258
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,720
She was right here. Kalyani!

259
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,120
Where is Kalyani? - She's
sitting near to the tap. She sent me.

260
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,080
Shall I call her?
- No, it's ok.

261
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,480
You're fine. I needn't come everyday.

262
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,120
My head was aching yesterday.
I couldn't sleep.

263
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Don't worry. I'll send the medicines.
You'll be fine.

264
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,920
Give this to Kalyani.

265
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,680
Doctor has sent this for you.

266
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
'Kalyani, there's no
need to be afraid of me.'

267
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,200
'Now I'll stay away from you.'

268
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,160
What's written?

269
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,360
Can I say something?

270
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,480
What?
- You're making a mistake.

271
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,520
Why are you ignoring such a
great man like the doctor?

272
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,320
You won't understand.

273
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
I will. I'm also a woman.

274
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,280
It's no use troubling
someone and being sad yourself.

275
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,040
I don't have any other way.

276
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm not just what I seem to be.

277
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,800
Where should I hide my past?

278
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,480
And if you want to attain anything
in life, you've to pay for it.

279
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,800
But I've nothing to give.

280
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,040
Then will you keep
running away all your life?

281
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,240
You'll be released from jail some day.

282
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,040
Where'll you go then? What'll you do?

283
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,640
Kamla, you took leave from work,
saying that you aren't well.

284
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,920
Instead of taking rest,
you're chatting here.

285
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Go.
- Yes.

286
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
Kalyani, give me your card.

287
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,600
Why do you want this?

288
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,440
For the board meeting.
- What's that?

289
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,480
Don't you know? There're board
meetings in prisons every year.

290
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
Those prisoners who've behaved well..

291
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,880
..they're released before time.

292
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,280
Won't they release me before time?

293
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,240
Definitely!

294
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,600
By lying down and
eating good food here..

295
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,200
..are you doing a
favor on the government?

296
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,920
Warden, listen.

297
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,560
Actually, don't talk
like that. It hurts.

298
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,200
No! I was just joking!

299
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,520
You know, the deputy
jailor didn't propose your name.

300
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,320
But the jailor didn't agree.

301
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,840
He proposed Phool Bano and
your name for the meeting!

302
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,560
The Warden came for
your card, didn't she?

303
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,480
I sent her.

304
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,560
The jailor had cancelled your name,
but I forced them not to do so!

305
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,040
Thank you.

306
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,920
Don't thank me! This was
such an ordinary thing.

307
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,920
Whenever I see you, I feel that..

308
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,080
..the female prisoners shouldn't
be given such a filthy dress.

309
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,400
Such a dirty cloth! And
the stitching is terrible!

310
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,880
I'll definitely write to them..

311
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,800
..that educated and
decent girls like you..

312
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,840
You think I'm decent?

313
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,160
What are you saying?

314
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,200
I mean you.. - Had you spoken
so impolitely to a decent girl..

315
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,000
..then she would've insulted you.

316
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,440
Sir, the entire
prison is discussing this.

317
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,040
I wonder whether you know
it or not. It's disgraceful!

318
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
Our doctor and..

319
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,080
That C-class prisoner.. Kalyani!

320
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,960
Examining the
patient is just an excuse!

321
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,720
Both of them sit for
hours together and..

322
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,480
I mean, even if you don't
believe this, these rumors..

323
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,680
Anything else?

324
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,040
Yes.. this is the board meeting file.

325
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,840
There're still some days
left for the board meeting.

326
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,320
Give it to me later.

327
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,760
Yes, sir.

328
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,440
You may leave.

329
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,120
What?
- What did he say?

330
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,640
Nothing, he didn't even bother.
And it never will.

331
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,800
That doctor is the son of
our Jailor's father's friend.

332
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,680
So what? The Jailor isn't everything.

333
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,520
He has a superior too.

334
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,720
If we don't protect hose
female prisoners..

335
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,920
..then who will! - Absolutely!

336
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,720
Ramdai is sitting outside, in
the sun. I'll call her.. - No.

337
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,720
I came here to meet you.

338
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,880
For the last time, I want
to hear from you.. - Doctor!

339
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,800
I want to know your decision today.

340
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,040
First listen to my past.
- Kalyani.

341
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
I'm only concerned with your present.

342
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,640
But when your society humiliates you..

343
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,400
..because of me, what then?

344
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,280
I don't care about them.

345
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,000
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

346
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,360
Even today if you can't
understand what my heart wants..

347
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,400
..then I'll wait for you.
- No!

348
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,360
This'll never happen!
Please forgive me!

349
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,360
In line! Doctor! The
superintendent is here!

350
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,880
I'll see if all's well.

351
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,720
Is she the C-class prisoner?
- Yes.

352
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,080
What's she doing here?
- She's nursing the T.B. Patient.

353
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,520
Doctor, how's the patient now?

354
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,560
She's fine from the past few days.

355
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,480
I see.

356
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,840
By the way, send this
patient to Sadar hospital tomorrow.

357
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,360
I'll ask the civil surgeons
to arrange for a bed for her.

358
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,120
And give her some hard work to do.

359
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,520
Wow! Beautiful flowers!

360
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,760
But they shouldn't be in prison.

361
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,520
Attention! Salute!

362
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,600
The princess has
become a pauper again!

363
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,120
I've spent so many years in prison..

364
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,040
but I've never seen such lovers!

365
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,280
What's this? Your resignation?
You want to quit the job?

366
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,640
Yes, brother.

367
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,960
Tell me.

368
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,360
Is your resignation connected to
superintendent's behavior yesterday's?

369
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,520
No.
- Then why are you resigning?

370
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,800
Actually, the prison doesn't suit me.

371
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,640
You know that before coming here..

372
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,560
..I used to work at
the civil hospital.

373
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,560
There I've seen ill patients,
who I can cure.

374
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,320
Here I've seen ill-minded people,
whom I can't cure.

375
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,520
Anyway, send my resignation
to the I.G.'s office today.

376
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,120
I'll take your leave. I've a lot
of work is pending at the hospital.

377
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,320
Look Devendra..

378
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,680
..it's not good to be so
sentimental regarding your job.

379
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,760
What'll mom think if
you quit this job?

380
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,120
You know her.

381
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,000
She wanted me to quit the
job and practice in my city.

382
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,520
Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

383
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,880
Do you really love Kalyani
or is this just an attachment?

384
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,760
No. I really love her.

385
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,800
Knowing the fact that she's punished
for committing a murder? - Yes.

386
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,240
But now all this is useless.

387
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,240
She refused to accept me.
- Why?

388
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,680
She didn't tell me the reason.

389
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,160
Ok, I'll take your leave.

390
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,360
Give my regards to your mother.

391
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,960
All's well!

392
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,320
Sir, when did you arrive?
- Just now.

393
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,880
Devendra?
- Yes, mom.

394
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,000
You returned all of a sudden.
Did you take leave?

395
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,040
No, I quit my job.
- Quit? Why?

396
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,240
I didn't like it.

397
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,120
Good. I'll finish my prayers.
You freshen up. - Ok.

398
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,760
Devendra.

399
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,720
I've been noticing
that you remain sad.

400
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,200
Tell me what the matter is.
- It's nothing.

401
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,960
Look. I'm your mother.

402
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,720
You can't hide anything from me.

403
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,160
What's wrong with you?

404
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,320
There's no point knowing about it.
It'll make you upset instead.

405
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,120
And I can't even
share it with you openly.

406
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,040
Ok, does Mahesh know about it?

407
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes, he does.

408
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,600
Forget this tea. It's gone cold.
I'll bring hot tea for you.

409
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:14,200
"Send brother this time, father."

410
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:22,640
"Call me during the monsoon."

411
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:30,520
"When my childhood friends return."

412
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:38,960
"Send a message to me."

413
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:47,720
"Send brother this time, father."

414
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:03,000
"We'll swing again,
under the mango tree."

415
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:11,000
"It'll rain pitter-patter."

416
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:18,920
"The bliss of monsoon
will arrive again.."

417
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:26,280
"..in your courtyard, father."

418
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,600
"My eyes well up. My heart yearns.."

419
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:42,760
"..when I remember my childhood."

420
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:51,800
"Send brother this time, father."

421
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,360
"My youth snatched my childhood."

422
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:14,240
"It stole my dolls."

423
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,800
"Father, you raised
me with such love."

424
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,440
"Then why've I become a stranger?"

425
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,800
"I've neither received any letter.."

426
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:44,680
"..nor has anyone come to meet me."

427
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:52,280
"Send brother this time, father."

428
00:37:52,520 --> 00:38:00,120
"Call me during the monsoon."

429
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:09,400
"Send brother this time, father."

430
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,200
Sushila said that you wanted
to meet me. What's the matter?

431
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,520
Don't include my name
in the board meeting.

432
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,600
I don't want to be released.

433
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,840
Why?

434
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,680
Where will I go?

435
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,720
There's no refuge
for me outside prison.

436
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,080
But I know that someone
wanted to help you sincerely..

437
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,480
..but you refused.

438
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm talking about doctor.
I've known him a long time.

439
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,560
He's a decent man, who
follows sincere principles.

440
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,280
I respect him too.

441
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,640
I couldn't accept his
love for his betterment.

442
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,680
I didn't want..

443
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,160
..to ruin his
unblemished life due to my past.

444
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,280
What's your past that
scares you even today..

445
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,520
..and is ruining your future?

446
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,960
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

447
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,800
Do you want to know?
- Yes.

448
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,120
My father was a post
master in Bahadur Nagar.

449
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,320
We were a small family.

450
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,280
Mom, dad, my brother and I.

451
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,280
Mom expired when I was a child.

452
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,960
My elder brother
gave me motherly love.

453
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,080
Brother deeply influenced my life.

454
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,680
He had a group in the village..

455
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,480
..and their job was to
help the poor and needy.

456
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,080
For this work, very often he
had to stay out many days.

457
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,960
But dad never
stopped or restricted him.

458
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,400
He was proud of him.

459
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,360
Once, 10 miles away from a village..

460
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,960
..a flood occurred at
the river due to rains.

461
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,240
Brother immediately
went there with his group.

462
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,880
And then..

463
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,760
..he never came back!

464
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,200
After a few days, we
came to know that..

465
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,280
..in order to save a
girl of my age, my brother..

466
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,360
I can't say it! I
won't be able to say it!

467
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,560
It's ok.

468
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Write your story
down and give it to me.

469
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,480
I'll ask Sushila to arrange
for a pencil and book for you.

470
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,240
Sushila.

471
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
Take her to her ward.

472
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,360
Hail the motherland!

473
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,520
Hail the motherland!

474
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Hail the motherland!

475
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,600
Hail the motherland!

476
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,440
Hail the motherland!

477
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,080
Why is there a commotion in the
male ward? - Hail the motherland!

478
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,680
The revolutionary in our ward
is going to be hanged to death.

479
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,320
The warden was saying
that his widow mother

480
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,320
and sister have come
since evening, at the gate.

481
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,760
Oh, god!

482
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,560
Hail the motherland!

483
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,320
Hail the motherland!

484
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,520
Hail the motherland!

485
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,360
Hail the motherland!

486
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Hail the motherland!
- Quiet!

487
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,920
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

488
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,440
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

489
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,560
"I'm fortunate that I was
useful to the motherland."

490
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,440
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

491
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,600
"Don't cry."

492
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:08,240
"Send me happily.
My life will be successful."

493
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:19,680
"Send me happily.
My life will be successful."

494
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,640
"Your son took birth crying,
but he's smiling why dying."

495
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,320
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

496
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,600
"Don't cry."

497
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:51,840
"Wherever my ashes
mingles with the land's soil."

498
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:02,960
"Wherever my ashes
mingles with the land's soil."

499
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,080
"A hundred roses will bloom."

500
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,920
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

501
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,080
"Don't cry."

502
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:37,840
"I won't be alive, but
whenever there's darkness."

503
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:49,280
"I won't be alive, but
whenever there's darkness."

504
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,200
"You'll see a new glowing
star amongst the stars."

505
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:01,000
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

506
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,520
"Don't cry."

507
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:21,520
"I'll take birth again,
when the country is free."

508
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,280
"Mother!"

509
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:32,760
"I'll take birth again,
when the country is free."

510
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,720
"When the national flag will
is hoisted on the Himalayas."

511
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,160
"Don't cry, mother.
You have many sons."

512
00:46:54,360 --> 00:47:00,160
"Just as one changes clothes.."

513
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,640
"..the soul discards
the old body at death.."

514
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,000
"..and takes on a new body.."

515
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,840
"..to begin a new life."

516
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,520
All's well!

517
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,680
Sir, Kalyani has
sent this book for you.

518
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,840
Ok.

519
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,640
"The other day, I
became very restless.."

520
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,480
"..while talking
about brother's death."

521
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,880
"Brother meant everything to me."

522
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,720
"I can't tell you.."

523
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,200
"..how lonely I became after him."

524
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,960
"I disliked everything in the world."

525
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,920
"I would sit by the river and
stare at that place for hours.."

526
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,640
"..where brother bid us goodbye."

527
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,280
"Father tolerated the shock of
brother's death very calmly."

528
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,480
"He used to try to keep
himself busy in work.."

529
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,160
"..or in devotional poetry."

530
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,840
"He used to stare at
brother's photo with sad eyes."

531
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,000
"Without a drop of tear in his eyes."

532
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,920
Hail God.

533
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,880
Hail God.

534
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:13,520
The sun never sets
on the British empire.

535
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,560
What are you thinking, father?

536
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,440
I'm thinking about you.

537
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,440
Everyone says that I
should get you married now.

538
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,880
This is what I don't like about you.

539
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,520
Why do you listen to others?
I'll just study.

540
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,880
What if I was your son?

541
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,360
No.

542
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,480
You're good as a daughter.

543
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,120
God gave me a son.

544
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,720
But in vain.

545
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,880
Did he care about his old father?

546
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,880
He ran to help the poor,
leaving his own house.

547
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,680
And sacrificed his life for them.

548
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,040
Whatever it is.

549
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,280
His soul is resting in peace.

550
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,040
Where did you run away again,
leaving your studies?

551
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,320
I'll write to aunt that
you don't study at all!

552
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,920
Sister, if I didn't study..

553
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,200
..then how did I become
the monitor of my class?

554
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,600
Why did you bring all this here?

555
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,520
Had you called me, I would've
come there and had breakfast.

556
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,240
Rubbish! If I called you at 8,
you would've come after 10!

557
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,160
What to do, dear? I
can't work like I used to.

558
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,120
I get tired soon. Keep it.

559
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,600
Oh, God! A bomb blast again!

560
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,160
Where, Mr. Mishra!

561
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,960
A 14 year old boy in Muzzafarpur..

562
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,160
..threw a bomb on a British magistrate,
who was sitting on a carriage.

563
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,000
What's the world come to?

564
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,680
Nowadays children start
making bombs at a very small age!

565
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,680
There was peace in our village.

566
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,280
But from the time that revolutionary
boy has been house arrested here,

567
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,520
I'm afraid bombs will start
exploding in our village too!

568
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,320
Looking at him, I get very scared!

569
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,280
Who're you talking about?
That Vikas Ghosh?

570
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,800
I saw him at inspector
Hussain's house the other day.

571
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,040
He seemed to be very innocent.

572
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,600
Don't praise such a boy,
or else you'll be fired.

573
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,400
You should stay away from them.

574
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:55,200
"Next to the Jamuna river,
I met Kanhaiya."

575
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,400
Who did you meet?

576
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,400
Not me, Shobha, but
Goddess Radha did! - Really?

577
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,440
Where are you coming from?
- Aunt was not well.

578
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,120
I came to see her. I'm
going home now. - Ok, wait.

579
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,000
Even I've to go there.
Sister Prabha will tutor me.

580
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,360
I'll inform father
and then come with you.

581
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,480
I came so far while talking.
I'm going.

582
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,000
I'll definitely give you my
in-laws' address before leaving.

583
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,600
Do write to me!

584
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,040
Listen! Come here!

585
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,200
The way to the river..

586
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,000
Why did they run
away on seeing that man?

587
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,880
It's obvious. Don't you
know who he is.. - Who?

588
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,720
He's the revolutionary Vikas Ghosh..

589
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,360
..who's under house
arrest in this village.

590
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,040
It's police's strict order
that no one should talk to him.

591
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,840
He has a unique smile.

592
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,120
You find it unique!
I'm scared! I'm leaving.

593
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,480
You better leave too.

594
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,920
Sister Prabha.
- Yes, Kalyani.

595
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,280
I'm done with my studies.
I'll go home now.

596
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,760
How'll you go? It's
raining so heavily.

597
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,440
I doubt it'll stop.
You stay here tonight.

598
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,360
No. If I don't reach home,
dad will get worried.

599
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,560
I'll ask the peon of
the school to inform him.

600
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,600
You'll fall sick if you get drenched.

601
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,080
Come, help me in the kitchen.

602
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,320
What's the news, Tarun?

603
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,720
You've been assigned
an important work.

604
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,120
You know that Vikas from our
group is under house arrest here.

605
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,640
You'll have to deliver a
letter to him by tomorrow.

606
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,600
It's important. He
should get it by tomorrow.

607
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,760
Fine, I will. But why did
you come so late at night?

608
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,120
I came long back..

609
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,120
..but there's tight police surveillance
in this village due to Vikas.

610
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,160
That's why I'm hiding in the jungle.

611
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,240
You're still awake.

612
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,480
You must've heard everything then.

613
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,160
Sister, was it your brother?

614
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,800
Yes. Look, don't
tell anyone about him.

615
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,000
Kalyani, everything is ruined!
I think Tarun is caught!

616
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,080
The police might be here any moment.

617
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,320
You take this letter and run away.

618
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,400
Give this letter to
Vikas at any cost tomorrow.

619
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,920
Me?
- Yes. No one will suspect you.

620
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,600
Go. Hurry up.

621
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,800
Not from here. Go from the backyard,
through the jungle.

622
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,160
Who came here?
- No one.

623
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,400
Someone definitely
came here! We'll search!

624
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,680
As you wish.
- Go! Search the entire place!

625
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,160
Constable!
- What?

626
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,520
Let me pluck some flowers from there!
- No!

627
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,240
Actually, there's a
prayer back at our place.

628
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,880
And I need are these
flowers to worship god..

629
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,600
..or else the
prayers can't be conducted!

630
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,120
I searched everywhere, but
I didn't find such flowers!

631
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,600
Please!
- No one is allowed to go in!

632
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,160
You're very sweet! I'll just take 2
flowers! - Where have you come from?

633
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,840
Don't you know that I'm
the post master's daughter?

634
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,000
Mr. Sadashiv's daughter?
- Yes!

635
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,160
Okay. Pluck them.

636
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,080
Greetings, inspector.

637
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,080
Greetings.
- Welcome, sir! Have a seat!

638
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,320
What's the matter?

639
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,440
You've surrounded my
house with barbwires.

640
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,200
You've appointed two
Constables to guard my house.

641
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,600
Why am I being
honored all of a sudden?

642
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,160
We'll have to. You're a special guest!

643
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,200
Are you completely unaware
of last night's incident?

644
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,480
I heard the sounds of crackers.

645
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,520
And those sounds
have ruined our slumber!

646
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,760
No!
- Give it to me!

647
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,360
You appointed a dumb and deaf servant.

648
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,360
I'm not allowed to
talk to the villagers.

649
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,160
From your new arrangement, it
seems like I can't even go out.

650
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,640
No. After last night's incident, we
had to take precautionary measures.

651
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,720
But I'm facing problems.

652
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,080
I realize your problems,
but I can't do anything.

653
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,160
Yes, I can permit you to talk,
not to the villagers..

654
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,680
..but the government officials.
I won't mind that.

655
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:30,480
Thank you so much.
- Ok, I'll take your leave.

656
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,000
Come to the police station
for the attendance. - Ok.

657
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,440
It's ok! She's the
post master's daughter!

658
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,680
How long will you stand
holding all this? Keep it.

659
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,400
Let me complete my work
and then have breakfast.

660
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,160
You finish your work. I'm
standing here till then.

661
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,680
Can I come in?
- Who's it?

662
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,920
Come. It's you!

663
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,600
Greetings.

664
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,360
Please sit.
- Yes.

665
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,280
I couldn't find the
courage to meet you.

666
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,680
Now that inspector has permitted me,
so I came to trouble you.

667
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,880
It's no trouble at all. Sit.

668
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,560
I'll order tea.
- Yes, I'll definitely have tea.

669
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,880
Won't I get pudding to eat?

670
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,960
What? Yes. - Sorry! As soon
as I saw this, I'm hungry!

671
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,920
Gopal, ask Kalyani to send tea
and pudding for Mr. Vikas. - Yes.

672
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,240
Don't mind my being informal.
- No.

673
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,960
It's a rule that the host
always force their guests to eat..

674
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,480
..but the guest refuses.

675
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,080
But our society is different.

676
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,840
We hardly get good food to eat.

677
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,720
That's why whenever
I see such a thing..

678
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,280
..I don't feel like leaving it!

679
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,040
Gopal, take. You give him.

680
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,160
No! I'm scared!
- Why? Go!

681
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,920
The inspector was saying that
you've a number of poetries.

682
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,240
If you don't mind, can I come
and listen to them sometimes?

683
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,640
Yes, absolutely! I'll be glad!

684
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,280
Why are you standing there?
Keep the snacks here.

685
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,000
Who's this boy?
- He's the son of my widowed sister.

686
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,640
He lives with me and studies here.

687
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,840
The pudding's very tasty!
Who cooked it?

688
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,240
My daughter, Kalyani.

689
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,120
She was standing here when you came.

690
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,000
I forgot to introduce you.
- Never mind.

691
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,560
Gopla. Call your sister.
- Ok.

692
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,840
Sister!

693
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,720
Uncle is calling you.

694
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,840
Tell him that I'm going for a bath.
- Okay.

695
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,520
Who gave that letter to you?

696
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,680
Sister Prabha.

697
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,680
Is she Prakash's elder sister?
- Yes.

698
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,720
When did Prakash come to
this village? - Mr. Vikas!

699
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,280
The pudding was so tasty that..

700
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,960
..I'll have to come to
your place again for that!

701
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,280
She was the post
master's daughter, wasn't she?

702
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,120
By the riverside! Wow!
- I forgot my way and came here.

703
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,360
But don't forget your
attendance in the evening.

704
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,240
How can I forget in
your presence, inspector?

705
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,440
Sister!

706
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,640
Where are you?
- See!

707
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,080
Oh gosh! I was scared!

708
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,240
I scared you!
- Yes!

709
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,520
Aren't you scared of Mr. Vikas?

710
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,440
Why?

711
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,520
I'm very scared of him!

712
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,720
When he comes this time..

713
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,320
..ask him the technique of making
bombs. - I'll definitely teach you!

714
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,840
Oh gosh!
- Wait! Don't run away!

715
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,840
Is your dad at home?
- Yes. Come.

716
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,000
"O night, today you
decide my fate."

717
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:01,800
"Let me catch
a glimpse of my beloved."

718
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,080
"And my life
will be successful."

719
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,360
"I feel like I've
the entire world."

720
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,240
Wonderful.

721
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,240
You've heard very little, dear.

722
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,120
Reading this poetry
makes you feel blissful.

723
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:17,840
Sit, dear.

724
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,960
Your dad recites such
good devotional poetry.

725
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:22,760
You might know it as well.

726
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,480
She does recite it sometimes.

727
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,720
That's what I wanted to know!
You must sing too.

728
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,480
Not worth singing in front of anyone.
- She's got a sweet voice..

729
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,040
..but she didn't get
a chance to learn.

730
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,600
But this is not any singing
competition. Sing as you can.

731
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,120
I spoke impolitely to her!

732
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,040
So what? She's younger to you.

733
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,520
"Since the time you
came in my life, beloved"

734
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,520
"Since the time you came
in my life, beloved.."

735
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,040
"..my life has become beautiful."

736
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,640
"You read my eyes and
understood what's in my heart."

737
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,560
"I shouldn't have met you."

738
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,800
"Since the time you
came in my life, beloved"

739
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:35,920
"You fell in love with
this dusky looking girl."

740
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,240
"You fell in love with
this dusky looking girl."

741
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,720
"When I saw you and
peered in your eyes."

742
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,200
"When I saw you and
peered in your eyes.."

743
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,480
"..my eyes looked
adorned without the kohl."

744
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,920
"Since the time you came
in my life, beloved.."

745
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,560
"..my life has become beautiful."

746
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,760
"I sit at the shore like crazy Radha."

747
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,200
"I sit at the shore like crazy Radha."

748
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,480
"I return without fetching water."

749
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,280
"I return without fetching water."

750
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:34,080
"It's a strange kind of illness."

751
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,840
"Since the time you came
in my life, beloved.."

752
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,520
"..my life has become beautiful."

753
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,680
"I won't be able to
tolerate this sweet pain."

754
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,360
"I'm a delicate girl."

755
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,000
"I'm a delicate girl."

756
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,280
"I won't be able to bear.
Don't come closer to me."

757
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,400
"Since the time you
came in my life, beloved."

758
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,920
"My life has become beautiful."

759
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,600
"You read my eyes and
understood what's in my heart."

760
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,040
"I shouldn't have met you."

761
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,680
"Since the time you
came my life, beloved."

762
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,480
In the dark night, Radha is
secretly going to meet Krishna.

763
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:17,080
That's why she has
worn dark colored clothes.

764
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:22,640
Blue sari, blue bangles,
and kohl in her eyes.

765
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,480
But when her face glows in the dark..

766
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,880
..she's afraid that
someone might see her.

767
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,160
She asks "God to take
away my fair complexion.."

768
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,160
"..and give me a dark complexion."

769
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,600
That's all for today.

770
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,560
Now let's have sweets
prepared by Kalyani.

771
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,680
Can't you taste both together?

772
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,840
No.

773
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,960
We won't come to
know which is sweeter.

774
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,840
These sweets or the poetry.

775
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,360
You're a glutton.

776
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,560
Glutton! That's a compliment!

777
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,680
Girls are valued
because of gluttons like us!

778
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,880
Or else who's bothered about them?
- Why?

779
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:10,160
Don't we girls have any other work
besides satisfying men's hunger?

780
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,760
It's a difficult job
to satisfy hunger, dear.

781
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,040
You all are the Goddesses of food..

782
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,080
..in front of who even the
gods bow down.. - Absolutely!

783
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,640
Without eating Sujata's porridge..

784
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,600
..Siddhartha would've never
become Buddha.

785
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:31,120
Sir, someone wants to send a
telegram. Says it's urgent. - Okay.

786
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,000
You sit. I'll finish my work.

787
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,320
Oh, God.

788
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,560
Do you agree with dad?

789
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,200
Regarding?

790
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,760
Girls should always be in the kitchen.

791
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,200
They can't do anything else.

792
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,280
Three years back, I wouldn't
have agreed with your dad.

793
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,960
I would've said that women can equal..

794
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,440
..men in every aspect.

795
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,120
But once, after seeing a woman,
my opinion changed.

796
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,680
Did she belong to your group?

797
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:20,360
No,

798
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,960
She had no relations with our group.

799
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,400
Three years back..

800
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,440
..while looting ammunition, my
partner was shot by the police.

801
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,600
When I was running
with him on my shoulder..

802
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,640
'I was tired of running,
but I had no time to rest.'

803
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,440
'The sound of the police's
footsteps was coming closer.'

804
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,160
'My injured partner
was striving for water.'

805
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,640
'Finally I saw a safe place
and made him laid him down there'

806
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,600
'..and went to fetch water.'

807
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,040
'When I came back, I
saw that he was dead.'

808
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,840
'The one who wanted to see
the country free, had died.'

809
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,200
'Suddenly, I heard 'Hands up'.'

810
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,240
'The police found us due to the
drops of blood on the ground.'

811
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,960
'I was sleeping in prison.'

812
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,760
'Suddenly someone woke me.'

813
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:42,200
'That stranger got me out of
prison and brought me near a river.'

814
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:46,320
'There was a boat over there.
He asked me to wait.'

815
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:48,720
'He had to return the prison keys.'

816
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,320
'When he came back, giving the
keys to a woman standing in a hut..'

817
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,400
'..I asked "Who that kind
lady was, who got me released".'

818
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:06,560
'He told me that she was
the inspector's wife.'

819
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,160
'I was shocked.'

820
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,160
'Later when that man told me that..'

821
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,840
'..she has helped a
lot of revolutionaries.'

822
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,960
'I was amazed.'

823
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:20,520
'After seeing motherly love
in that inspector's wife..'

824
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,320
'..my opinion about women changed.'

825
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,960
'There's no need for
women to be like men.'

826
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,000
'They can help us from home.'

827
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,080
I'll make a move. It's time for me
to register my attendance. - Wait.

828
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,080
I'll light the lamp.

829
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,120
Who named you Kalyani?

830
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,560
I don't know. I think brother did.

831
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,480
It suits you.

832
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:02,560
Others' names are just for namesake,
but yours reflects your identity.

833
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,160
You're really Kalyani (well-wisher).

834
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,800
It is said that the eyes
reflect what's in your mind.

835
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,880
If this is true, then
I'm not wrong about you.

836
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,960
Why? What did you see in my eyes?

837
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,880
Your gleaming eyes
remind me of dew on flowers.

838
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,200
'Blue sari, blue bangles,
kohl in the eyes.'

839
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:06,360
"Take away my fair
complexion and give me a dark one."

840
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:14,720
"I'll hide in the night.
Give me my beloved."

841
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:22,920
"Take away my fair
complexion and give me a dark one."

842
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:29,440
"I'll hide in the night.
Give me my beloved."

843
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:48,800
"My shyness stops me, but my
restlessness takes me ahead."

844
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:56,040
"My shyness stops me, but my
restlessness takes me ahead."

845
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:02,760
"I don't know where I'm going,
someone please tell me."

846
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:11,200
"Take away my fair
complexion and give me a dark one."

847
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:18,080
"I'll hide in the night.
Give me my beloved."

848
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:39,360
"The moon peeps
secretly though the clouds."

849
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:46,560
"The moon peeps
secretly though the clouds."

850
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:53,080
"I curse you! You're
smiling after troubling me!"

851
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:01,640
"Take away my fair
complexion and give me a dark one."

852
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:08,320
"I'll hide in the night.
Give me my beloved."

853
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,240
"There's something that I've lost..

854
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:27,960
"..there's something
that I've achieved."

855
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,640
"There's something that I've lost..

856
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,200
"..there's something
that I've achieved."

857
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:41,800
"Where's my mind leading me?"

858
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:50,360
"Take away my fair
complexion and give me a dark one."

859
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:57,160
"I'll hide in the night.
Give me my beloved."

860
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:12,040
"Take away my fair
complexion and give me a dark one."

861
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,920
Do you know why Vikas didn't
come here since a few days?

862
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,800
He's ill. I met
inspector on the way. He told me.

863
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,440
It's difficult for him to find food.

864
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,960
Is there barley at home?

865
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,480
Yes.

866
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,840
Why don't you cook barley and
send it to him through Shambhu?

867
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,560
I'll send it right away.

868
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,120
Hail Lord.

869
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,000
Did you give him the barley?
- Yes.

870
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,880
But he wasn't eating.

871
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,480
When I told him that you
cooked it, he ate it immediately!

872
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,800
He respects you a lot!

873
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,040
Okay, go and give hookah to dad.
- Yes.

874
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,000
Listen!
- Yes.

875
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,320
Is he fine now?
- Oh gosh! I forgot to ask this!

876
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,240
Oh no!

877
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,560
I came because I was
feeling restless today.

878
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:21,440
So late at night.

879
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,800
Yes. Ok, I'll leave.

880
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,280
What happened?

881
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,040
You've high fever!

882
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,800
Your body is burning!

883
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I was.. ill in the evening.
That's why I fainted.

884
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,240
I'll manage.

885
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,960
No! I won't let you go
in such heavy rains!

886
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,000
Let it stop raining, you
can leave then. Come in.

887
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,520
I'm thirsty.

888
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:19,560
I'll get water.

889
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,920
I.. Did I fall asleep?

890
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,440
I feel asleep. How are you now?

891
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:21,320
I'm fine.

892
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,520
Mr. Vikas!

893
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,080
Someone is calling you.

894
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,640
What will we do now?

895
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,480
Mr. Vikas!

896
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,720
Don't worry. I'll see.

897
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,680
Mr. Vikas!

898
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:58,240
What you did was bad!
Anyway, come on.

899
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,200
Where's the post master?

900
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:05,680
Yes, call him. Explain to him
that decent people live here!

901
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:11,440
Instead, send her to some brothel..
- Hey! Mind your tongue!

902
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,960
I won't tolerate my
wife's humiliation!

903
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,280
Your wife?
- Yes.

904
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:26,160
Sir, ask him when and how he
got married.. - Keep quiet!

905
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,160
Excuse me.

906
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,160
Come. Take blessings from your dad.

907
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,320
Don't hesitate.

908
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:47,840
Come with me.

909
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:15,400
We want your blessings. Please
bless us that we live happily.

910
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,520
I'm solely responsible for
whatever happened today.

911
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,160
Believe me.

912
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,880
I'm not marrying her just to
save you from getting humiliated.

913
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,560
I really love..

914
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,440
I.. never imagined that..

915
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,960
..I'd have to come to you
for her in such circumstances.

916
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,040
The police are waiting for me.

917
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,520
I need time to think.

918
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,760
Is your dad not well?

919
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,200
Go and serve tea to dad.

920
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:01,120
Why? You serve him everyday.
Why should I go today?

921
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,640
No. You serve him.

922
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:08,600
Wonder what's wrong with everyone!
Everyone's upset! Give it!

923
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,480
There's an order from Sadar that
Vikas has to be sent there today.

924
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,240
He wanted to meet you
before going. I allowed him.

925
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,760
What do I do? I can't find
any solution, inspector.

926
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,080
I can understand
your condition, brother.

927
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,600
But I think you should get
Kalyani married to Vikas.

928
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,920
But he's not well settled. - It's
the question of dignity right now.

929
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:51,440
If you refuse, then the
villagers will start taunting.

930
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:59,160
Honestly speaking these
revolutionaries keep their word.

931
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:05,520
I think the restrictions on
him will also be lifted soon.

932
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,160
I suggest don't hesitate
in getting them married.

933
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,440
The rest is your decision.
I'll take your leave.

934
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,520
Don't you want to say anything?

935
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:34,680
I'd be satisfied if I could hear you
say that I didn't make any mistake.

936
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:50,640
Here's my address. Write to me.

937
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:12,160
The police are waiting for me.
I have to go to Sadar.

938
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,720
Did you think about us?

939
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,080
Yes, son.

940
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,680
I've decided to get
Kalyani married to you.

941
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:27,680
Vikas, I've no one else in
this world, besides Kalyani.

942
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,680
Don't ever hurt her.

943
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,440
Mr. Vikas.

944
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,000
Listen.

945
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,000
Mr. Vikas, hurry up.

946
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:16,480
How are you, Sadashiv?

947
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,960
Have a seat, doctor.

948
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,480
That school teacher Raghu was
saying that you've slowed down.

949
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,520
Yes. I've been ill since a few days

950
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,240
Poor teacher does my work.

951
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,120
I was busy too. After a long time,
I've managed to come.

952
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,000
Did Mr. Vikas write to you?

953
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,000
Yes, 2 months after he left.

954
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,120
He wrote that the
police have released him..

955
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,400
..but he's down with malaria.

956
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,240
He'll come here as
soon as he gets well.

957
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,000
But 2 months have passed.

958
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,040
Neither did he come,
nor did his letter.

959
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:00,880
Didn't you write to him?

960
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,080
Four times, but he didn't reply.

961
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,680
That's strange.

962
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,880
It'd be better if
Kalyani got married soon.

963
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,000
The villagers are gossiping.
They're spreading strange rumors.

964
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:23,120
I think you should get
Kalyani married to some other boy.

965
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,080
It will shut everyone up.

966
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:30,000
I can't commit a sin in
order to shut everyone's mouth!

967
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,440
Is marriage everything in life?

968
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,960
Vikas has accepted her as his wife..

969
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,240
..and even I agreed.

970
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,600
I believe that Kalyani
and Vikas are married.

971
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,200
Kalyani, there's a letter.

972
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,720
My letter!

973
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:59,720
It's not for you.

974
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,560
The letter that you sent
to Mr. Vikas has returned.

975
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,200
I hope dad didn't see.

976
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,880
No. I kept it with me.

977
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,560
Kalyani, listen.

978
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,360
Is your marriage date fixed?

979
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,200
I don't know. - You don't
know when your marriage is!

980
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,200
But do invite us!

981
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,760
Invitation for what?
She's already married!

982
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,560
She won't marry again!

983
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,560
Did you call me, sister?

984
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,960
Yes.

985
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,760
Did Vikas reply to your letter?

986
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,160
No. My letter came back.

987
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,480
He doesn't live on that address.

988
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,120
Tarun wrote the same to me.

989
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,080
He sent a bad news too.

990
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,800
How do I tell you?

991
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,600
You'll be very upset.

992
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,040
I'm used to enduring sorrows now.

993
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:05,880
Tell me.

994
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,920
He has written that Vikas
doesn't live in Lucknow.

995
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,680
He works in Patna. And..

996
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,240
He got married.

997
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,840
Kalyani, women are
born to endure sorrows.

998
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,000
Make yourself strong.

999
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,240
I'm very strong.

1000
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,600
We've been listening since
months that he'll write to you!

1001
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,960
Don't puzzle us now! - It's a lie!

1002
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:53,880
He neither wrote to them,
nor will he ever write!

1003
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,960
He's gone!

1004
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,760
What can I do if we
didn't write to us?

1005
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,520
Why are you asking us?

1006
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,480
Did you ask us
before calling him home..

1007
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:12,960
..and reciting romantic
poetry in front of your daughter?

1008
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,760
Please keep quiet!

1009
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,120
How many can you stop? The
entire village is saying this!

1010
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:22,360
Bear the consequences of your deeds!
- Fine.

1011
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:26,880
I did what I wanted to. And
now you do what you want to!

1012
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:30,640
This is a government office!
If you people threaten me here..

1013
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,440
..I'll complain to the police!
- Yes! Go!

1014
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:37,600
We'll see how you live in this
locality with your daughter!

1015
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,760
Won't we?
- Yes!

1016
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,240
Kalyani.

1017
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:56,400
Kalyani.

1018
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,760
I can't find a clean drape.
Didn't the washer-man come?

1019
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:02,840
Answer me!
Didn't the washer-man come?

1020
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,800
Gopal!

1021
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,120
Yes.

1022
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,800
Go and get my washed
drape from the washer man!

1023
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,400
Sister sent me to him yesterday..

1024
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:17,120
..but he said that the
villagers have threatened him.

1025
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,640
That's why he won't
wash our clothes.

1026
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:22,720
You go.

1027
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:34,360
Kalyani, listen. You
write to Vikas today.

1028
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,560
No. I won't.
- Why?

1029
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,760
Fine.

1030
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,920
I will.

1031
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,720
No. You don't write either.

1032
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,040
You won't write, neither will
you let me. What do you want to do?

1033
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,000
People insult me in my own house
and you want me to keep quiet!

1034
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,680
I get so humiliated because of you!

1035
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,880
Either you leave this house,
or I'll leave it!

1036
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,920
'Dad, I'm leaving this house.'

1037
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:20,200
'But, trust me I'm
not angry with you.'

1038
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,200
'I'm going because I don't
have any other alternative.'

1039
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,560
'I can't see the
villagers insulting you.'

1040
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,160
'Until I'm here,
your sorrows will grow.'

1041
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,520
'And I..

1042
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,160
..can't see you sad because of me.'

1043
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,440
'Had I told you this before,
you wouldn't have allowed me.'

1044
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,960
'Perhaps, I wouldn't even feel
like going after seeing you.'

1045
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,200
'That's why I'm leaving at night,
without informing you.'

1046
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,480
'Dad..

1047
01:35:58,280 --> 01:35:59,560
'Don't search for me.'

1048
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,160
'Don't worry about me either.'

1049
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,720
'Your blessings will
always protect me.'

1050
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:42,240
'Dad..

1051
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,880
..please forgive me.'

1052
01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:05,080
"Someone is calling
you out every time."

1053
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:14,400
"Someone is calling
you out every time."

1054
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:22,600
"The one who goes
there never returns."

1055
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:29,960
"Someone tell me what secret is this?"

1056
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:37,320
"O traveller, come back if possible."

1057
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:45,320
"Don't forget this bank, this path."

1058
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:52,840
"O traveller, come back if possible."

1059
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:05,600
See who it is.

1060
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,600
It's you!

1061
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:12,160
Where's your luggage?

1062
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,800
Who have you come with?
- I've come alone.

1063
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,400
Ok. Come in.

1064
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:24,160
My dad told me about
you a few days back.

1065
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:27,960
Why did you come all of a sudden,
without informing?

1066
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,120
I couldn't live in
the village anymore.

1067
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,960
I thought of staying
with you for a few days.

1068
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,000
Is there no news about Mr. Vikas?

1069
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,720
Why did you leave
the village suddenly?

1070
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,200
Everyone started humiliating
my old father because of me.

1071
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,480
I couldn't endure that.

1072
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:02,560
Who's she?
- My friend, from our village.

1073
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:08,400
It's ok. Don't touch. You've
come from outside. I've to pray.

1074
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,400
Sit, Kalyani.

1075
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:13,760
Daughter-in-law. She's the daughter..

1076
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,760
..of the post master of your village?

1077
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:18,960
Your dad was talking
about her, wasn't he?

1078
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,280
There was a scandal in
your village because of her..

1079
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,600
Mother, come here.

1080
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,120
You shouldn't say all
this in front of her.

1081
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:30,040
Look, I don't like to gossip
about anyone behind their back!

1082
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,640
We have a family! We'll have to
follow the norms of the society!

1083
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,880
If she wants to live here
then refuse her, got it?

1084
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,840
Ok, mother. Go in.

1085
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,440
Kalyani!

1086
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,560
Don't mind mother.

1087
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,880
Where will you wander?

1088
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,520
You're under my oath. Wait
here until my husband returns.

1089
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:56,120
He'll definitely
arrange something for you.

1090
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,600
Come.

1091
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,920
We came here with a lot
of expectations, doctor.

1092
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,960
What should we do now?
She's in trouble.

1093
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,920
Look, Pratap, I would've
definitely done something..

1094
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,040
..if it was possible.

1095
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,680
There's no work in my nursing
home that I can assign to her.

1096
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:24,960
But our maid is on leave. We
need a replacement for her..

1097
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:29,440
..who could wash the patients'
clothes or clean their rooms.

1098
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,640
Will she do all this?

1099
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,280
No! She won't!
- I will.

1100
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:38,720
I'll do everything.

1101
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,480
I just need shelter right now.

1102
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,720
I've heard your story from them.

1103
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:50,680
For now, you can start working here.

1104
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:54,040
I'll make the arrangements to
make you a trained nurse later.

1105
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,000
Where will she stay?

1106
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:00,840
Nurse.

1107
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:02,920
Yes, doctor?

1108
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:06,440
Show her the room on the terrace,
next to the storeroom.

1109
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:08,960
She'll stay there.
- Yes, doctor.

1110
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,720
This is your room.

1111
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:18,520
You'll back answer me! - Oh gosh!
Will you beat me with this?

1112
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:22,200
Yes! I'll kill you! Why did
you serve me tea in a dirty cup?

1113
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,800
What happened?

1114
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,360
You ask what happened!

1115
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,880
This big hospital of
yours is filled..

1116
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,960
..with illiterate
nurses and useless maids!

1117
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,200
What did she do?

1118
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,520
My husband has
brought new cups for me.

1119
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:39,120
But she served me tea in
this dirty and broken cup!

1120
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,120
Why? How would I know that
your husband brought.. - Shut up!

1121
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:47,560
Did you hear? She's
arguing with me in your presence!

1122
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,960
You leave. Don't get angry..

1123
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,120
Oh, God!
- Sit!

1124
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:52,760
I've never seen such a woman!

1125
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,360
She's so hot-tempered!
She hit the cup on my face!

1126
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,360
If you don't arrange for
a good maid immediately..

1127
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:05,680
..then I'll break all the
furniture of your hospital!

1128
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,360
Calm down. I'll make complete
arrangements for your service, ok?

1129
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,200
Listen.

1130
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,920
The patient in room no. 3
is suffering from hysteria.

1131
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,720
She gets very angry.

1132
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,560
None of our maids
are able to handle her.

1133
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:35,360
After observing your work, I think
you know how to control patients.

1134
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,840
If you could take
her responsibility..

1135
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:40,160
Don't worry. I'll see.

1136
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,720
Good.

1137
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,400
What do you want?
- The doctor has sent me.

1138
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:56,520
Are you a nurse?
- No. I'm a maid.

1139
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,120
Maid!

1140
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:02,800
What's your name?
- Kalyani.

1141
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:07,080
They've chosen a nice name for you!

1142
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,760
Are you married?
- No.

1143
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:14,880
So you're a damsel!

1144
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,240
That's why you've
adorned yourself so much!

1145
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,720
Wonder what you'd do
if you were beautiful..

1146
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:23,240
What am I supposed to do?

1147
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,600
Massage my feet!

1148
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:30,960
Get up, you fool! How
dare you sit on my bed?

1149
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:35,240
I'm sorry.. - Shut up!
Go and wash this bed sheet!

1150
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,400
And listen.

1151
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:44,120
I have tea numerous times.

1152
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,360
I should get tea on the dot, get it?

1153
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,480
Yes. - Now leave.

1154
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,920
Kalyani!

1155
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,640
Kalyani!

1156
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,400
Where the hell are you?

1157
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:25,920
See, I've brought
flowers for you today!

1158
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:30,640
You've bedecked yourself in
the morning and come to show-off!

1159
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,040
There's no sugar in it!

1160
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,960
I've brought sugar. You
can put as much you want.

1161
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:43,640
Are you ordering me? Put sugar in it!

1162
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:51,320
Mix it up!

1163
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:54,000
Enough!

1164
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,640
Where are you going?
Go and wash my clothes!

1165
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,720
Wait! Open this window!

1166
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:50,480
Shobha! Why did you arrive suddenly?

1167
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,920
Why are you quiet?
- Kalyani..

1168
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:59,040
You'll have to come to
Sadar hospital with me.

1169
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,640
Hospital! What happened?

1170
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,640
Your.. dad..

1171
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,960
Dad!

1172
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,880
Yes.

1173
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:14,600
He came to my place,
searching for you.

1174
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,600
He was coming here, but..

1175
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,440
..he met with an accident on the way.

1176
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,720
Recently his vision had become weak.

1177
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:31,120
How is he now?

1178
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,400
He's.. not fine.

1179
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,040
Come on.

1180
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,560
Sadashiv, who met with an accident
this morning, in which room is he?

1181
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,600
Come.

1182
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,560
Kalyani!

1183
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,200
Kalyani!

1184
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,080
Kalyani!

1185
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,120
Can't you hear? She's calling you.

1186
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,960
Kalyani!

1187
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:40,400
My throat's paining calling you
out and you didn't even listen!

1188
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:46,840
Wow! Look at her face, as if
she'll drop dead right now!

1189
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,720
What do I have to do?

1190
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,560
What do you mean? Did you
forget that it's time for my tea?

1191
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,160
Where the hell were you?
Go and make two cups of tea.

1192
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,920
My husband is coming here.

1193
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,400
Wait!

1194
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,360
Go and get my talc from there!

1195
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,520
Listen.

1196
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,960
Don't you dare come decked
up in front of my husband!

1197
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:34,720
Why are you sitting away from me?

1198
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,440
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

1199
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:39,880
Don't you love me?

1200
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:44,240
Who is it?

1201
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,360
You! What are you doing here?

1202
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,440
You were secretly
overhearing our conversation!

1203
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,880
Shameless!
- What's the matter, Shivani?

1204
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,200
Who're you getting angry on?
- You sit calmly!

1205
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:59,640
She's a shameless maid!
I'll teach her a lesson today!

1206
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,920
I'll complain to the
doctor about you!

1207
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:05,400
I'll get you thrown
out of here! Get lost!

1208
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,600
Kalyani!

1209
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,440
You're still standing here!

1210
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,360
The patient in room no.
3 is very furious!

1211
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,600
Quickly take tea for her!

1212
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:48,840
Just one cup. Her husband left.

1213
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,440
Doctor!

1214
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:52,160
No. 3!

1215
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:56,160
Nurse!

1216
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,040
How can you say this,
doctor? She used to be very happy.

1217
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:03,600
When I was with her this evening,
she was absolutely fine.

1218
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:08,120
What happened in this brief while
that caused her to commit suicide?

1219
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,800
I think..
- What?

1220
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:16,480
Sorry, but I feel this
isn't a case of suicide.

1221
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,960
Someone killed her.
- Impossible.

1222
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:23,240
No one can commit this
crime in my nursing home.

1223
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,640
Why did you suspect this?

1224
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,720
I can't be sure..

1225
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,320
..but when I was
with her this evening..

1226
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:34,560
..she fought with a maid
and scolded her a lot.

1227
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,320
Some downtrodden maids do such
things for revenge sometimes.

1228
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:43,800
Call that maid. I'll talk..
- She's right behind you.

1229
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:52,120
Kalyani! You're.. here?

1230
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,560
Move!

1231
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:59,560
Doctor, is your
entire staff present here?

1232
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,000
Yes.
- And Mrs. Shivani's husband?

1233
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,120
Yes, he's Mr. Vikas.

1234
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,360
Mr. Vikas, I'm very sorry.

1235
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:09,000
What have you to say about this?
- What?

1236
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,400
What have you to say about this?

1237
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:18,880
Inspector, I think she
committed suicide. - No!

1238
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:25,160
No! She didn't!
Murder! I murdered her!

1239
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,560
Punish me! I killed her!

1240
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:32,520
I killed her!

1241
01:55:33,080 --> 01:55:34,880
When I regained conscious..

1242
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:37,880
..I realized that I had high fever.

1243
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,400
In court, Dr. Verma
tried to prove that..

1244
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,000
..while committing the crime..

1245
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:48,640
..I was suffering through brain
fever and I wasn't in my senses.

1246
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:53,640
That's why the judge
sentenced me to 8 years in jail.

1247
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:58,840
Mr. Vikas tried to
meet me a few times..

1248
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,840
..but I was too
embarrassed to meet him.

1249
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:07,640
My crime was much bigger than his.

1250
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,840
Jailor, this is my past.

1251
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:20,240
Now you tell me. How can I
forget this and dream of my future?

1252
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:24,320
How can I ruin a decent
man's unblemished life?

1253
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,720
No, Mahesh. This is not possible.

1254
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:32,200
I can't get my Devendra
married to a prisoner.

1255
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:33,920
I told you the circumstances..

1256
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,480
..in which that poor
girl committed this crime.

1257
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,920
Will she have to suffer all
her life for that one mistake?

1258
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:44,760
If our society doesn't accept
such criminals with an open heart..

1259
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:46,800
..then crime will
increase all the more.

1260
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,520
Where will these
unfortunate people go?

1261
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:55,840
Admit her in the ashram that
you've opened for such girls.

1262
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,840
I thought the same, but
after knowing her past,

1263
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:04,960
I'm sure that Devendra made no
mistake in choosing that girl.

1264
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:09,080
Devendra is my only son.

1265
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,720
I could never imagine..

1266
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,600
..that I'd have to
refuse any wish of his.

1267
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:21,960
But this.. - I know that you
shouldn't be stubborn in this matter.

1268
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:27,560
But I request you to read
what's written in this book.

1269
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:40,680
Phool, are you missing your family?

1270
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,200
Don't cry.

1271
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,640
The board meeting is tomorrow.

1272
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,800
The jailor has given your name too.
You'll be released soon.

1273
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,520
All those who're present.

1274
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,600
We haven't gathered
here to discuss her crime.

1275
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:06,960
We just want to see how
Kalyani behaved in prison.

1276
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:11,800
Has she followed the rules
and regulations of the prison?

1277
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:17,000
Her record clearly shows
that not only in this prison..

1278
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:19,880
..but her behaviour has been good
in every prison that she was in.

1279
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:22,320
She was fabulous in this prison.

1280
01:58:22,760 --> 01:58:27,040
She risked her own life and
nursed a tuberculosis patient.

1281
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,280
Such a sacrifice by a prisoner is
unparalleled in the history of crime.

1282
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:34,200
I think this case
should be thought about.

1283
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,560
Next case.

1284
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:51,120
Wonder whether we'll
ever meet or not!

1285
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:57,280
Don't cry, Phool. If you're
not released in this meeting..

1286
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:59,400
..then you definitely will,
next time.

1287
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,320
I'm leaving you people and going.

1288
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,000
I've always troubled you.

1289
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:27,640
Sister, please forget it
if possible.

1290
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,080
Come, Kalyani. It's getting late.

1291
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:56,600
Come.

1292
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,040
I thought of sending you to my
ashram, but mother wrote to me.

1293
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,440
Mother!
- Dr. Devendra's mother.

1294
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:05,000
I call her mother too. Here.

1295
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,720
'Kalyani dear, may God bless you.'

1296
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:12,920
'I never saw you..

1297
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:17,800
..but it seems as if
your beautiful face..

1298
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,760
..is in front of me all the time.'

1299
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,160
'When you'll marry my Devendra..

1300
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,280
..'I'll become peaceful
and free of my worries.'

1301
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,800
'I'm waiting for that
auspicious day.'

1302
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:31,680
'Blessings.'

1303
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:35,080
'Your mother.'

1304
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:46,640
But.. does she know
everything about me?

1305
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:51,680
She does. I told her everything.

1306
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:55,280
She has decided to make
you her daughter-in-law..

1307
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,040
..after thinking properly.

1308
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:05,680
Don't cry, dear.

1309
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,280
I wished to drop you there myself..

1310
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,720
..but I'm not being granted a leave.

1311
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,880
That's why I'm
sending you with Sushila.

1312
02:01:14,680 --> 02:01:16,840
But you'll have no
difficulty on the way.

1313
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:18,840
I've made all the arrangements.

1314
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:23,320
You're free from here..

1315
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:26,240
..but you'll be imprisoned in
the prison of marriage forever.

1316
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,360
Sushila.

1317
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:33,160
Your tickets are with
our head clerk.

1318
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,640
You'll have to take a
steamer to Manihari valley.

1319
02:01:37,640 --> 02:01:38,960
You'll have to board a train
at 4 in the morning from there.

1320
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,920
That isn't a decent place. Beware.

1321
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,360
Take Kalyani to my bungalow for now.

1322
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,400
I've arranged food over there.

1323
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:14,440
Ma'am, sit here. I'll be back
when it's time to board the steamer.

1324
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,480
Come on time.
- Definitely.

1325
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,360
Kalyani, you sit here.

1326
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:22,560
I'll make
arrangements for food outside.

1327
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:25,120
But I don't feel like eating.

1328
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,880
That means you'll remain
hungry throughout the journey?

1329
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:30,040
I won't be able to
survive without eating!

1330
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,520
Let me see if we get
anything over here or not.

1331
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:40,840
Is it fresh?
- Yes, ma'am.

1332
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:43,120
Give me a quarter kilo.
- Ok.

1333
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:46,640
When will the steamer arrive?

1334
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:50,240
It's delayed. It'll
arrive along with the ship.

1335
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,200
Medicine!

1336
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,280
In the box!

1337
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:41,080
Give me!

1338
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,480
What should I say?

1339
02:04:02,600 --> 02:04:05,080
Did you suffer an attack again?

1340
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:08,040
Yes! You're late! Where were you?

1341
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:11,000
I went in searchof a stretcher
for you, but I couldn't find it.

1342
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,560
I've to die someday, Prakash.

1343
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:16,600
But you want to conduct my
final rituals even before I die!

1344
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:22,200
Never mind! I still
have some strength!

1345
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:25,280
I'll take your support.
- Do you know that man?

1346
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,440
Vikas is suffering from
an infectious disease.

1347
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:54,200
He has asked you to wash
your hands with an antiseptic.

1348
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,200
How long has be been
in this condition?

1349
02:04:58,120 --> 02:04:59,520
Since a long time.

1350
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:02,400
Are you his relative?

1351
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:06,600
No. I know him.

1352
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:09,720
Then you must know a
lot about his life.

1353
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:14,280
I pity him.

1354
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:17,360
He lost everything for the country.

1355
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,320
He spent all his life in prison.

1356
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,280
After getting released,
he got married..

1357
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:26,640
..but still wasn't happy.

1358
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:30,840
Because he had to marry helplessly.

1359
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:32,920
Why?

1360
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:36,080
Because after getting released,

1361
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:39,920
the party leader ordered
him to marry the daughter of

1362
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:41,520
..a top police officer's relative.

1363
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:44,600
Police officer's relative?
- Yes.

1364
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,680
First he refused..

1365
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,360
..because he loved someone else..

1366
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,280
..and had promised to marry her too.

1367
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:58,080
But there was a deep secret
behind this order of the party.

1368
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:02,320
Knowing the secrets of the
police with the help of that girl.

1369
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,720
When brother Vikas learnt this..

1370
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:10,800
..he sacrificed his
love for the country.

1371
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,200
But his wife expired.

1372
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,840
She was ill and was
admitted in a nursing home.

1373
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:20,160
He says that she committed suicide.

1374
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,240
Where are you taking him now?

1375
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:25,320
He insists that he
wants to go to his village.

1376
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:28,360
Although there are no
doctors there to take care of him.

1377
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:29,920
We tried to explain to him..

1378
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,760
..but he says that he
doesn't wish to live any longer.

1379
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:40,280
Wash your hands quickly. I've
to book my place in the steamer.

1380
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:42,840
I'll wash my hands. You leave.

1381
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:14,560
Kalyani.

1382
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:20,640
I know you don't want
to listen to me.

1383
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:27,240
You've faced a lot of problems
and humiliation because of me.

1384
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:31,640
I'm.. not defending myself..

1385
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,320
..but whatever happened,
happened against my will.

1386
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:40,200
I wrote everything
to you in a letter..

1387
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,400
..but it came back to me.

1388
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,960
Perhaps, you left the village

1389
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:49,080
It's no use talking
about all this now.

1390
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:54,360
I know, but let me say it.

1391
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:59,960
Perhaps, destiny made us meet
so that I can apologize to you.

1392
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:04,280
Otherwise I never
expected to meet you again.

1393
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:10,120
Kalyani, I was really sorry to
fill your live with problems.

1394
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:13,240
But..

1395
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,760
I never asked anything from God.

1396
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,120
I didn't even pray.

1397
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:23,080
But until I'm alive..

1398
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:27,800
..I'll always pray for
your happiness.

1399
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:30,960
..your happiness. Your happiness.

1400
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:51,440
"O oarsman!"

1401
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:56,920
"O oarsman!"

1402
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:04,200
"My beloved's on the
other side. I'm here."

1403
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:11,240
"Take me to the other side."

1404
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:17,720
"My beloved's on the
other side. I'm here."

1405
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:24,720
"Take me to the other side."

1406
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:27,840
"My beloved's on the other side."

1407
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:43,920
"Forget all the
memories we had completely."

1408
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:50,840
"I had no good quality in me.
Forget all my bad qualities."

1409
02:09:54,080 --> 02:10:00,480
"Forget all the
memories we had completely."

1410
02:10:00,600 --> 02:10:07,160
"I had no good quality in me.
Forget all my bad qualities."

1411
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:12,560
"For today's goodbye."

1412
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:21,440
"Even after dying, I
would've waited for this goodbye."

1413
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:27,760
"My beloved's on the
other side. I'm here."

1414
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:34,920
"Take me to the other side."

1415
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:38,240
"My beloved's on the other side."

1416
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:58,640
"Don't play with my heart.
It'll destroy you."

1417
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:08,560
"Don't play with my heart.
It'll destroy you."

1418
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:15,160
"I belong to my beloved.
I'm his companion."

1419
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:20,760
"It pulls me towards you."

1420
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:29,240
"Every call pulls me towards you."

1421
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:32,960
"My beloved's on the other side."

1422
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,960
"O oarsman!"

1423
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:40,600
Kalyani!

1424
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:44,240
Where're you going? -
The one I should go to!

1425
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:46,200
Don't be foolish!
We've to go the other way!

1426
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:49,080
No, warden! I've to go there!
- Kalyani!

1427
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:52,480
Please let me go!
Apologize to jailor on my behalf!

1428
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:57,080
Kalyani, don't go there!
The streamer's departing!

1429
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:14,040
Kalyani!

1430
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:27,000
Kalyani!

1431
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:51,840
"I belong to my beloved.
I'm his companion."

1432
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:57,600
"It pulls me towards you."

1433
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:06,000
"Every call pulls me towards you."

1434
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:10,160
"My beloved's on the other side."

1435
02:13:10,400 --> 02:13:11,400
"O oarsman!"
