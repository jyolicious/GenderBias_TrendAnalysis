1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,725
This Air India flight is headed
from Delhi to London

2
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:18,230
Among the passengers

3
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,865
Indian and foreign

4
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:24,005
Newly weds and those married
for many years

5
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,906
Ministers and sentries

6
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:30,243
And a very strange girl. Deepa

7
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:36,981
Young, beautiful and rich.
She's fed up of life

8
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:42,857
At 23, she has three unsuccessful
love affairs behind her...

9
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:45,655
and she's going to Paris
to seek solace

10
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:52,066
She bears the impression that there
are no real lovers in India

11
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:21,730
"An opportunity like this,
you will never have again"

12
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,030
"A man with a heart like mine,
you will never find again"

13
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:30,495
"Come, let me take you around Paris
on a colorful evening..."

14
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:38,042
"An Evening in Paris"

15
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:42,784
"An opportunity like this,
you will never have again"

16
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:46,777
"A man with a heart like mine,
you will never find again"

17
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:50,658
"Come, let me take you around Paris
on a colorful evening..."

18
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:59,362
"An Evening in Paris"

19
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:29,054
"Look at this bevy of beauties"

20
00:02:29,364 --> 00:02:33,232
"They say such sweet things"

21
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:37,264
"They do color your heart..."

22
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,541
"when they choose to play
hide-n-seek with you"

23
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:45,439
"Look at this bevy of beauties"

24
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:48,950
"They say such sweet things"

25
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,887
"They do color your heart..."

26
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:57,582
"when they choose to play
hide-n-seek with you"

27
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:02,129
"Where will you find an
opportunity like this again?"

28
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:05,625
"Where will you find
someone like me again?"

29
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:10,695
"Come, let me show you a
colorful evening of Paris..."

30
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:18,468
"An Evening in Paris"

31
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:44,335
"Arm in arm..."

32
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,632
"they're very much in love"

33
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,413
"Seek your companion here..."

34
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:56,611
"and you will have
a beauty too"

35
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,887
"Arm in arm..."

36
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,920
"they're very much in love"

37
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,897
"Seek your companion here..."

38
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:12,958
"and you will have
a beauty too"

39
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:16,768
"Where will you find an
opportunity like this again?"

40
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:21,340
"Where will you find
someone like me again?"

41
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,841
"Come, let me show you a
colorful evening of Paris..."

42
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:34,054
"An Evening in Paris"

43
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:03,206
"Have a heart..."

44
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:06,419
"fall in love,
before you die"

45
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:11,322
"Who has seen tomorrow?"

46
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,922
"Take a walk down these lanes
right today"

47
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,561
"Have a heart..."

48
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:23,836
"fall in love,
before you die"

49
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:27,903
"Who has seen tomorrow?"

50
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:31,768
"Take a walk down these lanes
right today"

51
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:36,013
"Where will you find an
opportunity like this again?"

52
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:40,185
"Where will you find
someone like me again?"

53
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:44,158
"Come, let me show you a
colorful evening of Paris..."

54
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:52,623
"An Evening in Paris"

55
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:56,402
"An Evening in Paris"

56
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:01,231
"An Evening in Paris"

57
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,341
God! It's so late, and the
mistress's vehicle hasn't landed

58
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:19,446
She's arriving in a plane,
not in a bus, sardarji

59
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:23,683
I know, I'm at an airport,
not at a bus-stop

60
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,952
There she is!

61
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:37,898
What do you mean?
- I'm your slave, your chauffeur...

62
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,505
Sardar Makhan Singh.
- You're making a mistake

63
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,110
What mistake? Here's the
telegram you sent

64
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:47,580
That isn't my telegram.
- This garland isn't yours either

65
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:48,748
I'm sorry

66
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,125
Namaste, Deepaji.
- You?

67
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:01,622
Damodar Dayal, your manager.
- My uncle in Paris!

68
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,797
I'm your mistress, right?
- That's right

69
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,663
I'll fire you if you are formal
with me again. I'm just Deepa for you

70
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:15,205
And you're my mistress...
- Who?

71
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,139
Your driver.
- Sardar Makhan Singh

72
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,113
Please wait in the car.
I'll go and fetch your luggage

73
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,366
This is the best locality of Paris

74
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:50,237
And I've engaged this flat
specially for you

75
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:53,677
How about you?
- I have an apartment near the office

76
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,320
This is Honey.
She's studying in Paris

77
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:07,394
I thought you'd need a companion

78
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:14,163
I have an important meeting,
if I'm not needed here, dear

79
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,372
Go ahead.
- Deepa mustn't have any trouble...

80
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,038
You needn't say that, uncle.
- See you tomorrow morning

81
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:31,114
I'm terribly tired.
I'd like to take a bath first

82
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,346
Where's the bathroom?
- Right ahead

83
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,284
Hot water, towels...
everything's ready

84
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:41,126
The driver's bringing my luggage.
Please fetch my dressing gown

85
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:42,693
It's right at the top.
- Okay

86
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:44,599
Would you like something to drink?
- Coffee

87
00:09:00,116 --> 00:09:02,914
Mistress, I've brought your luggage.
- Keep it there

88
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,654
And what do I see? A dream!

89
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:11,194
Beautiful! Very beautiful!
You're too good to be true!

90
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:13,321
What did you say?
- Solid! You're for real!

91
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,464
Honey...
- Coming!

92
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:24,431
Honey! What a sweet name...
like the petha from Agra!

93
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,842
Did I hear you say something?
- I want to

94
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,109
I know today what
hate at first sight means!

95
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,816
Nut!
- I think you like me

96
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:42,248
What happened?
- Come here. Quick

97
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,198
I open this door and
guess what I see

98
00:09:51,534 --> 00:09:52,330
A peeping tom?
- No

99
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:55,092
Look down there

100
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:04,080
That's perfectly normal.
- Out in the open?

101
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,844
Out here, they romance every where
and every time

102
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:13,149
It's something Paris is famous for.
If you don't fall in love in Paris...

103
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,789
you won't fall in love
anywhere else in the world

104
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,686
But love, you've got to find.
- In Paris?

105
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:24,292
In Paris, love finds you
- Really?

106
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:31,295
Honey, I always have a dream...
an unfinished dream

107
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:33,303
Of love?
- Yes

108
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:37,273
It isn't about lust or fancies.
It's a dream of true love

109
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,943
You mean you don't have a boyfriend?
- Why not?

110
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,321
I have many.
- So what's wrong?

111
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:50,059
But they love my wealth...
not me

112
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,960
I've lost faith in lovers

113
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,257
But nobody knows you here

114
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:01,303
You can pretend to be
a simple, poor girl

115
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:05,433
And if someone falls for a poor girl,
he'll be a true lover. Right?

116
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:23,283
Please put this away safely.
I'll ask you for it, when I need it

117
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:25,217
I'll keep it in the safe
at the office

118
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,755
Another thing...
I'm a very poor girl

119
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:31,362
This flat belongs to Honey,
and I'm her maid-servant

120
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:32,625
Pardon me?

121
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:36,232
That's what you will tell anyone
who asks you about me

122
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:37,698
But...

123
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,734
That's a secret we can't
tell you about, uncle

124
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:45,278
You may leave now.
- Very well. Here I go

125
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:51,717
Makhan's late, Honey.
- Here I am

126
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,989
I had to look in every nook
and corner of Paris...

127
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,089
to find this dress of
an Indian maid-servant

128
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,955
I'll try it on

129
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:06,164
Try something, beautiful one.
- What?

130
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:10,636
My love, I mean. I'm willing
to do anything for you

131
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:16,640
Shut up, or you'll lose your job!
- For you, I'd even give up life!

132
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:20,114
Look what I've got for you.
- Lipstick?

133
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,408
Yes. Apply it on your lips

134
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:26,680
That's something!

135
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:32,053
Had I known you'd cling to me
after one little burst...

136
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:35,421
I'd have bought
a dozen fire-crackers

137
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:37,995
Cheat, rascal!
You dare do this!

138
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:39,428
I'll fix you yet!

139
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,936
Shekhar?
- What's this?

140
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,412
Daddy, since when you have
started dealing in jewelry?

141
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:00,713
Put that back in there.
- Is that fake or real?

142
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:03,885
It belongs to my mistress.
- Mistress?

143
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:09,493
Yes. Deepa, she's here
on a tour of Paris

144
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:15,360
I'll take her around Paris, daddy.
Just introduce me to her

145
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,730
Never. You're not worthy of it

146
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,904
Didn't I ask you not to come here?
- I'm in need, daddy

147
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:23,776
What is it?
- I need 200,000 rupees

148
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:26,378
200,000?
- I've got to repay some debts

149
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:30,550
Debts of liquor and gambling?
- It's a question of my life, daddy

150
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:34,746
I have nothing to do with it.
- I'm your only son, daddy!

151
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:39,218
Our relationship ended when I got to
know of your misdeeds

152
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:43,391
Please, daddy! You must help me!
You have millions!

153
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:48,300
The money belongs to Deepa's father.
I'm only their manager

154
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,332
Daddy, I might lose my life!

155
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:56,474
Shekhar, I have no sympathies
for a gambler. You may go now

156
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:07,221
Where will I look for her?

157
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:09,414
My word!

158
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:18,258
Who's that?
- Why are you there, Your Majesty?

159
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:20,901
I'm right here!
- What are you doing here?

160
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,530
I asked you to look for Deepa.
- You're right

161
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,603
From the Eiffel Tower, I was
looking for her.

162
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:29,467
I saw you and I came
down immediately

163
00:14:31,347 --> 00:14:34,077
Where could she have gone?
- I'll tell you

164
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,314
She has gone looking
for her true love

165
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,913
I can speak a bit of Hindustani

166
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:47,815
An Indian guy is my friend.
- Wonderful. What is your name?

167
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:54,586
My name is Deepa

168
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,797
Deepa! Wonderful!

169
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:10,070
A beautiful girl like you isn't
in love, nor married. Why?

170
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:15,611
Boys in India look for money
in marriage

171
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,321
No. They're all very greedy

172
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:28,790
Cheats! Frauds!

173
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,876
What?
- You're beautiful and I'm in love

174
00:16:44,914 --> 00:16:48,577
I'm very poor?
- Eh?

175
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,581
Good! I'm poor too.
No Mama, no Papa

176
00:16:55,925 --> 00:17:00,021
Aren't you married?
- Not married

177
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:02,794
You and I will marry.
- I must leave now

178
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:04,989
Leave? Will you come tomorrow?

179
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,133
Sure, I will

180
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:08,695
I will too!

181
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,143
Photographer! Where have you
been all these days?

182
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:57,382
I want an Indian dress. Quick!

183
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,209
What do you want?

184
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:02,313
A dress! I want to be
an Indian Maharaja

185
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,557
An Indian Maharaja?
Are you in your senses?

186
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:11,492
I'm not! I learnt Hindustani from you
and met a beautiful Indian girl

187
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:14,128
I've fallen in love with her!

188
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,764
What's her name?
- Deepa

189
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,702
A look at her, and my heart skipped
a beat. I'm going to marry her

190
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:27,239
Marry her? Couldn't she
find an Indian boy?

191
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,552
Indian boys lust for money.
- Says who?

192
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,980
Deepa. They're frauds and cheats!
- Who's this insolent girl?

193
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,188
Where are you meeting her again?

194
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,068
Really? I've got to fix her...
I sure must!

195
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:48,195
I want to be an Indian Maharaja!

196
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:22,104
Deepa! Are you happy?

197
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:26,131
And who are you?
- An Indian Maharaja!

198
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,876
We're going to marry, okay?

199
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:24,829
I'm not their father!

200
00:21:16,285 --> 00:21:18,014
Lady...

201
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:24,555
Because of one man, you have a
wrong impression of all Frenchmen

202
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:29,060
You said you're French.
- Sure. I live in France

203
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:33,334
But you speak Hindustani?
- As well as you do

204
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,839
Spent twenty years in your country.
Are you from Lucknow?

205
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,830
No. From Delhi.
- I see

206
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,100
My father was a professor
of French in Lucknow

207
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,541
I see

208
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,237
Your name?
- Deepa

209
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:48,549
Lovely name... you are, too!

210
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:50,886
On a pleasure trip in Paris?
- Yes, no...

211
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:54,913
I'm here with my mistress.
I'm a poor maidservant

212
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:59,057
Strange. When I was in India,
maid-servants didn't speak English

213
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:03,192
Anyway, we're all equal in Paris.
There is no discrimination

214
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,300
To prove that we must have
some coffee together

215
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,464
No, I've got to go.
- But I must do something for you

216
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:11,899
Why?
- To dispel doubts...

217
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:15,301
that Frenchmen aren't good human beings
- That's what my first experience was

218
00:22:15,677 --> 00:22:17,338
So you must have another experience

219
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:33,489
What did she say?

220
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:39,134
She says, only fortunate men
have beautiful wives

221
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:41,898
What?
- Do not take offense

222
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:44,868
She thought I'm married, too,
although I'm not

223
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:51,043
I haven't come across a girl who
isn't hankering for money

224
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,711
What do you mean?
- No offense meant...

225
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:57,716
but girls are generally very selfish.
- Boys are the ones who are selfish

226
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,217
I know them all very well.
- Maybe you do

227
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,185
But you don't know French boys.
- Something special about them?

228
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:08,427
Yes. They could die
for the girls they love

229
00:23:10,499 --> 00:23:13,161
When they fall in love, they
follow the girl for an eternity

230
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:16,795
Don't you follow me, mister.
It won't be good for you

231
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:19,630
Why must I? Strange girl!
You haven't even asked me my name...

232
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:22,274
I'm not at all interested!

233
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,901
"Ask me..."

234
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:23,933
"what my name is"

235
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,504
"Give me a loving look..."

236
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,442
"and ask me what I seek"

237
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:35,577
"Don't meet me after that,
if you don't want to..."

238
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:37,945
"Ask me..."

239
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,512
"what my name is"

240
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,483
"Give me a loving look..."

241
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:46,719
"and ask me what I seek"

242
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:53,594
"Don't meet me after that,
if you don't want to"

243
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:13,045
"Do not be angry"

244
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,652
"Listen to me"

245
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:21,458
"Take me for your own"

246
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:24,693
"From a distance..."

247
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:27,401
"you could yet have
been deceived"

248
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,294
"From a distance..."

249
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:31,196
"you could yet have
been deceived"

250
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:35,000
"Get to know me, now that
I'm so close to you"

251
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,346
"Ask this crazy man..."

252
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:41,140
"what his name is"

253
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,113
"Give me a loving look..."

254
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,945
"and ask me what I seek"

255
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:53,759
"Don't meet me after that,
if you don't want to"

256
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,446
"IIlusions have faded away"

257
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:22,087
"I understand it now.
I remember it well"

258
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:25,186
"In my dreams..."

259
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,792
"I often met you"

260
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,926
"In my dreams..."

261
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:31,096
"I often met you"

262
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:35,425
"In flesh and blood,
I have you here today"

263
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,963
"Ask me..."

264
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:41,642
"what my name is"

265
00:26:42,244 --> 00:26:44,735
"Give me a loving look..."

266
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:47,779
"and ask me what I seek"

267
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:54,551
"Don't meet me after that,
if you don't want to"

268
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:16,906
"It's a colorful evening
in Paris"

269
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:22,682
"Here's where love happens.
Beauty blossoms"

270
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:28,580
"A love story we
will surely make..."

271
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,825
"A love story we
will surely make..."

272
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:35,421
"a legend we will
surely leave behind"

273
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:39,795
"Ask me..."

274
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:42,671
"what my name is"

275
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:44,502
"Give me a loving look..."

276
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,173
"and ask me what I seek"

277
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:54,139
"Don't meet me after that,
if you don't want to"

278
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:56,149
"Ask me..."

279
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:58,642
"what my name is"

280
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,250
"Give me a loving look..."

281
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,752
"and ask me what I seek"

282
00:28:05,794 --> 00:28:11,562
"Don't meet me after that,
if you don't want to"

283
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:45,618
Who are you?
- Mr. Shekhar. The manager's son

284
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,426
This is our first meeting, but please
don't treat me like an outsider

285
00:28:51,934 --> 00:28:54,960
I have a role to play with Dad
in handling your business

286
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:59,540
That it's my business and I'm Deepa...
who told you?

287
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:00,809
Not I

288
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:04,105
Two things in the world
no one can ever hide

289
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,080
Beauty. And wealth

290
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:10,611
You are a living example of one
who possesses both in abundance

291
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,079
You are an interesting man.
Please sit down

292
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:19,053
Thank you, but I'm in a hurry.
Are you free tomorrow?

293
00:29:19,995 --> 00:29:20,859
What for?

294
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,599
Maybe I'm the lucky man
who will take you around Paris

295
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,831
We're going on a picnic tomorrow.
I've fixed it up with my friends!

296
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,694
I'm no enemy, am I?
- What?

297
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:32,233
I mean, I could join you and
your friends on the picnic

298
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,369
Ask her.
- May I?

299
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,902
Suit yourself

300
00:29:36,945 --> 00:29:38,105
I'll be here tomorrow

301
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:50,419
Quite a smart alec!
What do you think?

302
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,193
I think they are like that.
One and all

303
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:56,160
Are there going to be only girls
on the picnic tomorrow, or?

304
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:59,059
There will be boys too. But we
can get rid of them

305
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:00,325
So do that

306
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:06,531
What are you guys doing?

307
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,605
Shameless guys!
You knock down a small boy?

308
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:20,382
Leave me alone! For God's sake!

309
00:30:20,822 --> 00:30:22,016
I don't know where
the girls have gone!

310
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:24,053
Aren't you ashamed to be
following those girls?

311
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:25,418
I'll hand you over to the cops

312
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:29,121
Get lost, for God's sake!
- Sardarji...

313
00:30:29,665 --> 00:30:31,064
Here comes another

314
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:39,333
Is there where Miss Deepa lives?
- Who are you?

315
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,539
I'm Sam. Tell her, she'll know.

316
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:44,207
With a bouquet as big as that,
anybody would know

317
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:45,946
But my mistress is away
on a picnic

318
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:50,952
Your mistress?
- You want to meet Deepa, right?

319
00:30:51,386 --> 00:30:53,286
I'm her driver. Sardar Makhan Singh

320
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:58,982
Mistress, eh? And where has
she gone for a picnic?

321
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:03,128
All these guys here
want me to tell

322
00:31:03,498 --> 00:31:04,465
I'm not supposed to squeal

323
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:09,300
What does that mean?
- There are 12 girls in the party

324
00:31:09,905 --> 00:31:13,898
The guys here are the boyfriends
who've been ditched by the girls

325
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,679
Morons! Girls who have ditched them
can be straightened out too

326
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:20,913
How?

327
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:25,409
By going on the picnic.
Will you join me?

328
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:28,148
My heart-throb's out there!
- Where?

329
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:31,119
Honey! The mention of her name
sends my heart aflutter!

330
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,328
You love her?
- I'm scared, as much as I love her

331
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:36,195
I'm trying to make it work.
- But it won't!

332
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:37,689
I can make it work for you

333
00:31:39,968 --> 00:31:43,426
Come with me.
- You're god-send for me!

334
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,827
My word! You've broken the record!

335
00:32:52,274 --> 00:32:54,367
How did this break?

336
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:57,837
God broke it because
this man is a liar!

337
00:33:00,082 --> 00:33:02,277
I didn't tell him...
he came here on his own

338
00:33:02,551 --> 00:33:04,712
Who is he?
- The greatest magician in the world!

339
00:33:05,821 --> 00:33:07,448
Hukum Pasha!

340
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:12,022
The sparkle in your eyes tells me
your name... it's Deepa!

341
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:18,196
He's lying! He's a fraud!
- By God! Who are you?

342
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,034
A cheat! A vagabond!

343
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:27,798
Shekhar, don't mess with the magician.
He'll turn you into a dog

344
00:33:28,176 --> 00:33:30,838
I don't believe in any magic!
- But I do!

345
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:35,548
You seem to be a very learned man.
Can you tell me a secret of mine?

346
00:33:35,817 --> 00:33:38,251
Pick a card, son.
- Here goes

347
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,784
A slave!
- Whose?

348
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:43,750
Fall at the feet
where this card lands

349
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,657
What are you doing?
- I'm your slave!

350
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:53,493
Hats off to Hukum Pasha!
- Makhan Singh!

351
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:55,169
Forgive me

352
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:59,240
They've ruined the picnic. Let's go
elsewhere. I'll go and get the bus

353
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:10,414
He'll return in a moment.
His tires are deflated!

354
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:12,378
Look...

355
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:16,283
Twelve boyfriends!

356
00:34:16,892 --> 00:34:20,521
Twelve girls have ditched
twelve boys to come here

357
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:25,162
Can you tell us where they are?
- I can present them here right now!

358
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:27,932
This girl doesn't believe me!

359
00:35:16,218 --> 00:35:19,415
Those girls have left with their
lovers. Where's yours?

360
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:23,082
I have none.
- Lies! He's here, right before you

361
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,486
What?
- That's the truth!

362
00:35:32,367 --> 00:35:34,961
I should've known that
such a cheap thing only...

363
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:40,434
a true lover could follow his beloved
anywhere, everywhere, in every guise

364
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:43,445
Is he the one?
- Can't you tell from his face?

365
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:47,949
Hats off to your magic!
- So you knew who he is!

366
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,941
I swear! I still don't know
who he is!

367
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:55,278
You don't need to know.
She knows and this is between us

368
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:57,020
What a nuisance!

369
00:35:57,425 --> 00:35:59,552
Makhan Singh, could there be
a pump around?

370
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:01,123
A petrol pump?
- No, an air pump

371
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:03,294
Some scoundrel has deflated
all four tires

372
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:08,200
How will we return?
The city's far away

373
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,663
Arrange for transport, Makhan Singh.
- Transport?

374
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:13,405
There aren't even horses here!
But wait...

375
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:15,833
Let me play up to the magician!

376
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:20,078
Sir... can you help us, please?
- I'll arrange for your transport

377
00:36:23,451 --> 00:36:24,884
It has been arranged.
Follow me

378
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,496
There you are!
- Magic! This is a miracle!

379
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:37,260
Are you God himself?

380
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:39,925
Sit down.
- I'm not riding with him

381
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:44,163
So sit with me. Car or scooter,
what difference does it make?

382
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:46,066
I'm your driver anyway.
Sit down

383
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:49,576
Where will I sit?
- Hop aboard. He's like your brother

384
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:51,507
What happens of me?

385
00:36:52,047 --> 00:36:55,574
That which God wishes!

386
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:46,525
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

387
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:51,497
"I am unique,
you will concede"

388
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,833
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

389
00:37:56,244 --> 00:38:00,647
"I am unique,
you will concede"

390
00:38:01,516 --> 00:38:05,077
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

391
00:38:05,453 --> 00:38:10,015
"I am unique,
you will concede"

392
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:37,442
"These beautiful climes for love,
the breeze and this moment..."

393
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,710
"they're all with me"

394
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:44,381
"My goal is here before me..."

395
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:45,819
"it's all a matter of moments now"

396
00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:51,029
"These beautiful climes for love,
the breeze and this moment..."

397
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,095
"they're all with me"

398
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:56,271
"My goal is here before me..."

399
00:38:56,271 --> 00:39:00,105
"it's all a matter of moments now"

400
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:14,348
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

401
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:19,524
"I am unique,
you will acknowledge"

402
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:23,893
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

403
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:29,066
"I am unique,
you will acknowledge"

404
00:39:57,265 --> 00:40:03,500
"Every path I walk,
leads to you"

405
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,275
"So call me over to your place..."

406
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,100
"when may I come?"

407
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:17,243
"Every path I walk,
leads to you"

408
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:22,656
"So call me over to your place..."

409
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:23,356
"when may I come?"

410
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:38,933
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

411
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,640
"I am unique,
you will acknowledge"

412
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:48,410
"We'll come face to face again...
and you will realize"

413
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:53,685
"I am unique,
you will acknowledge"

414
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:26,431
I was dying for a cup of tea.
- Was it tea, or was it someone else?

415
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,334
What does that mean?
- What do you think of Sam?

416
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:35,878
He's an insolent beast!
- All said and done...

417
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:38,005
he's madly in love with you

418
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:40,713
Or he wouldn't have been
following you around like this

419
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,018
Do we fall in love
because he follows me?

420
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:45,083
That's what usually happens.
- Nonsense!

421
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:48,357
You think he'll follow me
every place I go?

422
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:51,023
I'm sure about that.
- Let me see then!

423
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:04,907
Is that Uncle?
This is Deepa here

424
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:08,035
Please come over immediately.
This is very important

425
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:17,181
Uncle, have you thought of something?
- I'm trying to

426
00:42:17,553 --> 00:42:20,147
You don't like it here in Paris...
- In Paris?

427
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:25,357
I don't want to stay here another day!
- There's Venice, Rome, Cairo...

428
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:29,830
Uncle, I'm sick of touring places
just for the heck of it

429
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:33,235
I want to do something now.
- So attend office from tomorrow

430
00:42:33,536 --> 00:42:34,628
You have a business of millions

431
00:42:36,405 --> 00:42:38,873
I don't want to get into business
to make money

432
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,839
I want to do something for
the welfare of the people

433
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:46,808
Something that will benefit mankind.
Or else, what life am I leading?

434
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:49,517
Just a minute, dear.
Let me think

435
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:53,882
Air hostess? No

436
00:42:55,558 --> 00:42:57,822
Modeling...? No

437
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:05,425
Next month, there's an international
youth festival slated to be held there

438
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:08,535
The Red Cross society from every
country sends its volunteers there

439
00:43:09,038 --> 00:43:10,562
I know the Director
of the Festival

440
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:16,004
Here's your chance. You can be part
of the Indian group, if you want to

441
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:17,779
Mankind will benefit

442
00:43:17,947 --> 00:43:21,348
Please arrange for
my departure immediately

443
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:23,084
By tomorrow morning,
it'll all be arranged

444
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,311
Wow!

445
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:24,473
Amazing! All youngsters here...
not an old fossil in sight!

446
00:44:24,814 --> 00:44:26,111
It's a youth festival, idiot!

447
00:44:28,117 --> 00:44:29,584
So let's you and I
have a festival too

448
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,883
You're young. So am I!

449
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:37,817
I'll shut up, but tell me,
what good is youth...

450
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:41,194
if it's spent in pining?
Why be young at all?

451
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:44,629
There he is!
- Forget Sam!

452
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:48,930
Thanks for the telegram

453
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:52,069
But where is she?
- In the Indian Red Cross section

454
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:54,941
We're put up at the Meridian.
- I see

455
00:44:56,612 --> 00:44:57,670
See you soon

456
00:44:59,882 --> 00:45:04,046
So this guy has his fingers
in two pies! The flirt!

457
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,117
What do you mean?
- He's in love with my mistress

458
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:11,122
To you, he says "See you soon"!
- Idiot! I'm only helping him

459
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,785
I sent him a telegram and
told him that Deepa's here

460
00:45:40,356 --> 00:45:43,086
Is anybody here?
- What happened?

461
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,150
Please sit down

462
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:51,291
Take off that handkerchief

463
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:58,004
You?
- Yes

464
00:45:58,307 --> 00:46:01,299
Ever since I've seen you,
I can see no one else

465
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,306
I wonder what disease this is.
- I know what it is

466
00:46:04,613 --> 00:46:08,071
Shamelessness!
- Really? Do you have a cure for it?

467
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:11,850
Sure. A patented cure.
Coming up in a moment

468
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:21,355
Matron, this is Deepa. Please come
here with the police immediately

469
00:47:10,212 --> 00:47:13,375
Get on with your work.
I don't think he'll come again

470
00:47:14,216 --> 00:47:17,913
I'm sure he'll come, sister

471
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:22,521
I'm really hurt! I swear!

472
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:27,792
I'm really hurt!

473
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,368
Stand up, mister!
- I can't, sister! I'm badly hurt!

474
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:43,634
Where? In your heart?
- No... here on the leg

475
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:46,574
Is it this man?

476
00:47:49,118 --> 00:47:51,780
Yes, but...

477
00:47:52,121 --> 00:47:55,056
Can't you see the injury?
Attend to it immediately

478
00:48:02,398 --> 00:48:04,992
Take a good look. Go ahead

479
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:09,965
You should know it's your
sacred duty to look after me

480
00:48:10,372 --> 00:48:13,341
It's something I've brought
myself to this state for...

481
00:48:14,877 --> 00:48:18,244
You've shattered my dreams!
Killed me!

482
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:20,606
It burns, really!
- It'll be okay

483
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:22,215
When?

484
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:28,680
I'm talking about your injury.
- And I'm talking about my heart

485
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:31,816
But how would you know what
happens to someone's heart?

486
00:48:42,204 --> 00:48:43,432
Did you have to show up now?

487
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:15,464
This is fun! I've found her!

488
00:49:17,406 --> 00:49:20,466
I've found you at last!
- Is this any way to come?

489
00:49:20,776 --> 00:49:25,440
Had I taken the proper route,
you'd have vanished. What then?

490
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:26,579
What then?

491
00:49:26,682 --> 00:49:29,014
It would be twilight,
whilst I looked for you

492
00:49:29,785 --> 00:49:31,887
It would soon be night
and what's in my heart...

493
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:35,653
would have remained in my heart.
- What is it?

494
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:39,153
Here's where my truck
always grinds to a halt!

495
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:41,687
I want to say it,
but I can't

496
00:49:42,531 --> 00:49:44,465
I find myself tongue-tied

497
00:49:48,804 --> 00:49:52,900
Honey, see that?
- What?

498
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:56,345
That little English boy?
- Yes

499
00:49:56,345 --> 00:50:01,116
Guess what he'll do when he grows up?
- What?

500
00:50:01,116 --> 00:50:03,983
He'll be a youngster someday.
Like me

501
00:50:04,253 --> 00:50:07,051
Really?
- Yes. And he'll meet a girl

502
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:09,116
Like you.
- Really?

503
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:13,825
Their acquaintance will grow...
and grow...

504
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:15,825
and grow some more...

505
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,536
like that balloon?
- I know what happens next

506
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:22,970
Do you? Tell me then

507
00:50:24,473 --> 00:50:26,031
It'll all be over.
Like that balloon

508
00:50:28,877 --> 00:50:30,071
English boy!

509
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,907
Little devil! I wasn't
doing a dance, was I?

510
00:50:35,284 --> 00:50:38,447
You had to burst it?
Couldn't you blow it some more?

511
00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:40,187
Get lost! Go on!

512
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:45,055
Shameless boys!
They've ruined it for me

513
00:51:06,282 --> 00:51:08,584
You? What brings you here?

514
00:51:08,584 --> 00:51:11,644
You're here to treat people.
And I come ailing

515
00:51:11,954 --> 00:51:17,859
What disease do you have?
- Some diseases show. Some don't

516
00:51:18,227 --> 00:51:19,990
And that which don't show,
are really very dangerous

517
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,302
What are your plans?
- I've just returned from duty

518
00:51:27,636 --> 00:51:30,434
I think I'll rest for a while.
- As if people come here to rest

519
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,073
Have you seen the range?
- Yes.

520
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:36,071
What does that mean?
- It's a beautiful mountain...

521
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:40,212
with snow everywhere. Go and
change quickly. I'll take you there

522
00:51:41,116 --> 00:51:42,913
All right, I'll be back
in a moment

523
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:06,641
Mind the rope

524
00:52:10,612 --> 00:52:13,581
Skiing? I can't do it.
- I'll teach you

525
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:15,282
No thank you, not I

526
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:18,810
Planes out here?
- Why not?

527
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:28,923
I want a joy-ride!
- It's a private plane

528
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,358
I don't know that!
Please arrange something!

529
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,967
Please arrange it...
- Okay. Stay here, I'll be back

530
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,760
Is there no place in the world
where I don't have to see your face?

531
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:07,763
There is a place certainly.
- Which one?

532
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:11,232
Your heart.
- You know that, don't you?

533
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,611
Yes, that there's no place for me.
But I'm not willing to believe it

534
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:18,808
Because I was taught in school,
try and try and...

535
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,015
Let me see

536
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:52,477
"All by yourself..."

537
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:58,414
"where are you going?"

538
00:54:00,022 --> 00:54:02,513
"All by yourself..."

539
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:05,589
"where are you going?"

540
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:09,322
"Wherever you're going,
take me along too"

541
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:12,392
"All by yourself..."

542
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:14,568
"where are you going?"

543
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:19,767
"Wherever you're going...
take me along too"

544
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,238
"All by yourself..."

545
00:54:24,713 --> 00:54:28,774
"where are you going?"

546
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:51,434
"I lie destroyed"

547
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:53,538
"Are you even aware?"

548
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:58,078
"Are you even aware?"

549
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,641
"I already belong to you..."

550
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:03,008
"do you know that?"

551
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,409
"I already belong to you..."

552
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:07,745
"do you know that?"

553
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,149
"What's all this about?"

554
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:12,893
"Have you any inkling?"

555
00:55:15,397 --> 00:55:17,695
"All by yourself..."

556
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,130
"where do you think you're going?"

557
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:24,930
"Take me along,
wherever you're going"

558
00:55:25,274 --> 00:55:27,242
"All by yourself..."

559
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:29,704
"where do you think you're going?"

560
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:34,644
"Take me along,
wherever you're going"

561
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:38,809
"All by yourself..."

562
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:42,981
"where do you think you're going?"

563
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:07,807
"Do not leave me in turmoil...
you're the life in me"

564
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:12,452
"Do not leave me in turmoil...
you're the life in me"

565
00:56:12,788 --> 00:56:17,248
"Do not turn your face away,
you're the life in me"

566
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:21,953
"Do not turn your face away,
you're the life in me"

567
00:56:22,297 --> 00:56:26,529
"Do not break my heart...
you're my very life"

568
00:56:29,304 --> 00:56:31,673
"All by yourself..."

569
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:34,009
"where do you think you're going?"

570
00:56:34,009 --> 00:56:38,844
"Take me along
wherever you're going"

571
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:41,206
"All by yourself..."

572
00:56:41,516 --> 00:56:43,643
"where do you think you're going?"

573
00:56:43,952 --> 00:56:48,355
"Take me along
wherever you're going"

574
00:56:48,724 --> 00:56:52,524
"All by yourself..."

575
00:56:53,295 --> 00:56:56,492
"where do you think you're going?"

576
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,419
"Somebody might stop you...
what will you do then?"

577
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:26,118
"Somebody might stop you...
what will you do then?"

578
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:30,864
"What will you do if
you're forced to halt?"

579
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,568
"What will you do if
you're forced to halt?"

580
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:40,868
"What will you do...
if I pander to your whims?"

581
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,277
"All on your own..."

582
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:47,449
"where do you think you're going?"

583
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:52,284
"Take me along,
wherever you're headed"

584
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:54,651
"All alone..."

585
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,892
"where are you going?"

586
00:57:56,892 --> 00:58:01,488
"Take me along,
wherever you're headed"

587
00:58:01,863 --> 00:58:04,991
"You're all alone..."

588
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:09,161
"and where are you going?"

589
00:58:11,306 --> 00:58:13,706
"You're all alone..."

590
00:58:15,944 --> 00:58:18,378
"and where are you going?"

591
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:28,523
Come, Deepa

592
00:58:29,064 --> 00:58:32,734
Where were you held up?
- I had lost my way

593
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:35,100
You could've taken help
- I did

594
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,031
But very few people here
understand English. So...

595
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:39,068
Which is why I ask you
to always be at my side

596
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:41,741
Well never mind.
Hey, you're shivering!

597
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:45,036
Yes. It was terribly cold up there.
And there was a chilly breeze

598
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,505
Your hands are cold
Do you want to fall sick?

599
00:58:47,749 --> 00:58:49,239
Go and change... Go on

600
00:59:00,295 --> 00:59:04,732
We have met.
- Maybe we have

601
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:07,461
Your name?
- Sam

602
00:59:07,902 --> 00:59:08,732
I'm Shekhar

603
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:14,504
Lost something?
- Well?

604
00:59:14,843 --> 00:59:17,437
Looks like you're desperately
looking for something

605
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:24,219
Looks like you're in the habit of
interfering in people's affairs

606
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:27,450
Only when Deepa is concerned.
- What does that mean?

607
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:29,051
Stay away from her.
- Why?

608
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,825
Because she and I are close

609
00:59:32,994 --> 00:59:34,825
You're in love with her?
- Very much so

610
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:37,761
So let's shake hands.
I'm madly in love with her too

611
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,527
More than my life, actually

612
00:59:39,801 --> 00:59:42,269
No one wants anything more than life.

613
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,468
Because life is most precious for every
human.

614
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,738
What do you think?

615
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,944
I think that in mine and Deepa's
affairs...

616
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:56,513
...her father's servant's son should
not interfere.

617
01:00:06,461 --> 01:00:08,224
Still feeling the chill?
- Yes

618
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,054
Have some brandy. It'll disappear.

619
01:00:11,366 --> 01:00:13,834
Decent Indian girls never drink

620
01:00:19,507 --> 01:00:21,065
You understand English, don't you?

621
01:00:22,377 --> 01:00:25,080
Here, gulp it down.
- But...

622
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,843
Don't drink it, Deepa!

623
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,682
A dance will warm you up

624
01:00:35,623 --> 01:00:36,749
I want to say something to you!

625
01:01:13,862 --> 01:01:18,299
I say, are you watching
what I'm watching?

626
01:01:20,268 --> 01:01:22,532
How did that leech
stick to my mistress?

627
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,593
God! What's he making her drink?

628
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,107
Whose room is this?
- Mine... yours actually

629
01:02:39,614 --> 01:02:42,981
May I lie down.
- Sure. Do lie down

630
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:53,989
Will you please call Honey
from my room, Shekhar?

631
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:58,623
Honey? Sure, why not?

632
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:03,399
Hurry up, Shekhar.
I'm feeling very sleepy

633
01:03:21,356 --> 01:03:24,553
He raises the bottle to his lips and
gulps it all down. Without any soda!

634
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:28,560
He's now unbuttoning his jacket.
- And Deepa?

635
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,091
Deepa's knocked out.
She's lying on the bed

636
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:31,989
I'll keep you posted

637
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,834
Come with me... come on!
- Where to? Tell me!

638
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:06,664
How I have waited for this day

639
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:12,072
After tonight, you will
forever belong to me

640
01:04:21,916 --> 01:04:23,884
It's your death

641
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,310
What?
- If you want to live anymore...

642
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,318
get out of that room and come
downstairs to the reception

643
01:04:32,026 --> 01:04:34,517
Jaggu? How did you land here?

644
01:04:36,097 --> 01:04:38,622
As if you didn't know!

645
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,896
I promised to pay the rest of
the money after a month

646
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:45,273
Where's Jack?
- Right here

647
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:49,733
Here? Now look, Jaggu...
take him away somehow

648
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,639
I'll pay you 5000 for it.
- 10,000

649
01:04:53,081 --> 01:04:56,141
All right, 10,000! But Jack mustn't
come anywhere near me

650
01:04:57,318 --> 01:04:58,285
You're so scared?

651
01:04:59,587 --> 01:05:03,353
As if you don't know! Your boss will
shoot me at the slightest provocation

652
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:05,523
Wait

653
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:09,297
Something is fishy.
He's talking about murder

654
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:11,026
God! What's he saying?

655
01:05:14,168 --> 01:05:16,500
Shekhar, come downstairs

656
01:05:16,637 --> 01:05:18,070
Downstairs?

657
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:21,170
The boss's orders. We'll wait
for you for 3 minutes

658
01:05:22,477 --> 01:05:23,739
Suppose I don't come?

659
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:28,513
In that case, we'll have
to come upstairs. Get it?

660
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,318
No, stay there. I'm coming

661
01:06:05,286 --> 01:06:06,048
Hurry up!

662
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:13,215
What's the scoundrel done to her?

663
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,833
Let me sleep

664
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:28,739
Get up, Deepa! Come to your senses!

665
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:32,374
Sam, you love me?

666
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,787
Let's get out of here
before he returns

667
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,885
Go ahead. I have other plans

668
01:06:46,094 --> 01:06:48,696
He's a dangerous man, you don't know.
- Never mind

669
01:06:48,696 --> 01:06:51,164
If he's a snake, I'm a mongoose!

670
01:06:51,399 --> 01:06:54,232
Just take her away and I'll come
after I've broken him up!

671
01:07:10,885 --> 01:07:14,981
Come to your senses, Deepa

672
01:07:17,391 --> 01:07:20,326
I think we must take her to her room

673
01:07:20,728 --> 01:07:23,060
And I think she ought to
remain in this room...

674
01:07:23,364 --> 01:07:27,391
because when she comes to, she must
know what could have happened to her

675
01:07:28,903 --> 01:07:30,165
Go to sleep. I'll keep watch

676
01:07:37,378 --> 01:07:38,675
Jaggu? You?

677
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:53,190
Where's the money?
- I told you I'd pay up in a month

678
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:56,129
Where will you bring it from?
- I'll get married

679
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,397
It's a millionaire's daughter.
It'll take just a few days

680
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:06,036
You're kidding!
- It's the truth. Believe me

681
01:08:06,407 --> 01:08:08,466
Where is she?
- Right here, in this hotel

682
01:08:08,776 --> 01:08:11,745
I want to see her.
- Okay, but it'll be from a distance

683
01:08:35,503 --> 01:08:38,563
"I'm terribly embarrassed about
what happened last night"

684
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:42,540
"I'll forever be grateful to you
for the things you did for me"

685
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:47,881
"I can't dare face you.
So I'm going away. Far away..."

686
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,910
"after getting close to you"

687
01:08:50,851 --> 01:08:52,978
"You'll receive this letter
after I have left"

688
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,227
There she is

689
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:02,992
Hurry up!

690
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,368
Suzy? How come Suzy's here, Jaggu?

691
01:09:07,368 --> 01:09:09,165
I don't get it either

692
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:16,675
Come on, Deepa

693
01:09:27,188 --> 01:09:29,622
Jaggu, isn't that Suzy?

694
01:09:30,024 --> 01:09:33,289
Suzy? Who's Suzy?
- The dancer at our casino

695
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:27,411
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

696
01:10:27,615 --> 01:10:30,015
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

697
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,814
"I've always waited for you
with a heart full of love"

698
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:38,957
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

699
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:41,922
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

700
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:47,023
"I've always waited for you
with a heart full of love"

701
01:11:08,956 --> 01:11:12,619
"Why're you sitting away from me?

702
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:15,624
"Come closer, and tell me the truth"

703
01:11:17,965 --> 01:11:24,370
"Tell me that you belong to me and
that we shall walk together. Forever"

704
01:11:24,438 --> 01:11:30,343
"Let me give him my heart...
Let me"

705
01:11:32,113 --> 01:11:34,673
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

706
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:37,609
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

707
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:42,719
"and I always waited for you with
a heart that was beating only for you"

708
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:15,583
"What are you scared of?"

709
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:18,347
"Let the world know"

710
01:12:21,495 --> 01:12:28,367
"Cupid struck, our hearts met,
and we fell in love"

711
01:12:34,575 --> 01:12:37,635
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

712
01:12:37,912 --> 01:12:40,540
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

713
01:12:40,848 --> 01:12:45,308
"and I waited for you with
love in my bosom, my love"

714
01:12:46,487 --> 01:12:49,354
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

715
01:12:49,623 --> 01:12:52,183
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

716
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:57,488
"and I waited for you with
love in my bosom, my love"

717
01:13:19,253 --> 01:13:21,687
"Come sunset, and lamps were lit"

718
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,821
"Your desires, your thirst,
was awoken"

719
01:13:25,893 --> 01:13:28,521
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

720
01:13:28,796 --> 01:13:31,287
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

721
01:13:31,565 --> 01:13:36,662
"and I waited for you with
love in my bosom, my love"

722
01:13:36,904 --> 01:13:39,304
"Take it away,
take away my heart"

723
01:13:40,407 --> 01:13:43,035
"It's your world,
your merry gatherings..."

724
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:48,304
"and I waited for you with
love in my bosom, my love"

725
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,420
What brings you here, Jack?
- I came along to see you

726
01:14:32,997 --> 01:14:35,989
Had I not seen it for myself,
I'd never have believed it

727
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:39,268
Now that I have met Suzy, I can say
for sure that that girl wasn't her

728
01:14:39,904 --> 01:14:44,432
Which girl?
- We saw a girl exactly like you

729
01:14:44,842 --> 01:14:46,332
An absolute look-alike

730
01:14:47,545 --> 01:14:52,448
There's just one Suzy in the world.
And she belongs to you

731
01:14:54,518 --> 01:14:56,179
Suzy can't belong to anyone else

732
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:06,056
Who's the other girl?
- Deepa. Daughter of my dad's boss

733
01:15:06,397 --> 01:15:08,957
Mr. Malik's daughter?
- You know him?

734
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:15,037
No. All I know is that he has
more money than he'll ever need

735
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,408
Deepa's his only daughter?
- Yes

736
01:15:18,809 --> 01:15:20,936
You want to marry her so you
can swallow the entire wealth?

737
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:25,982
Where's Deepa right now?
- Beirut

738
01:15:26,584 --> 01:15:29,951
What do you get for returning
a millionaire's daughter?

739
01:15:30,321 --> 01:15:31,345
A million dollars.
- Good

740
01:15:31,956 --> 01:15:34,083
Go to Beirut immediately. You know
what you've got to do

741
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:35,789
Wait. What are you guys
getting at?

742
01:15:39,897 --> 01:15:42,730
We will only kidnap Deepa.
After that...

743
01:15:42,866 --> 01:15:45,528
we'll strike a deal
with her father. Get it?

744
01:16:04,421 --> 01:16:07,151
Makhan hasn't returned, Honey?

745
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:11,388
Yes, he's not around

746
01:16:12,196 --> 01:16:13,891
Here I am!

747
01:16:14,765 --> 01:16:18,758
Have you arranged for a speed-boat?
- Strict laws here, madam

748
01:16:19,103 --> 01:16:21,537
Those who can't water-ski,
can't hire speed-boats

749
01:16:21,839 --> 01:16:25,138
Buy one, if you can't hire it.
- You don't understand

750
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:27,675
You need the club's permission
to go into the waters

751
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:29,647
And that you can get
on only one condition

752
01:16:29,647 --> 01:16:33,549
You need an instructor with you.
- So go and find an instructor

753
01:16:33,984 --> 01:16:34,814
Right away!

754
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:40,518
Why're you being stubborn, Deepa?
A speed-boat's very fast

755
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:47,856
I need the pace. Fast. Very fast.
So I can leave everyone else behind...

756
01:16:48,165 --> 01:16:50,133
and go far away

757
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:51,729
Only to forget Sam?

758
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:56,773
You're a strange girl. You looked
for true love all your life...

759
01:16:57,107 --> 01:16:59,166
and when you found him,
you want to go away from him

760
01:17:00,177 --> 01:17:02,077
I need an instructor

761
01:17:03,681 --> 01:17:07,242
Not a police inspector, an
instructor to teach water-skiing

762
01:17:07,618 --> 01:17:09,347
Make it quick. In five minutes.
Okay?

763
01:17:10,654 --> 01:17:12,713
Water! Get me some buttermilk!

764
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,093
Such a fast speed-boat?
No, I can't do it

765
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:21,353
Coward!

766
01:17:21,999 --> 01:17:28,097
Deepaji! Good luck! We've found an
instructor from our own country!

767
01:17:37,715 --> 01:17:42,286
Are you a Bengali?
- No. And you?

768
01:17:42,286 --> 01:17:45,687
I'm Deepak Sen.
A swimming champion

769
01:17:47,324 --> 01:17:49,849
Absolutely! Thank you!

770
01:17:52,696 --> 01:17:56,257
Mr. Sen, how much time does it
take to learn water-skiing?

771
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,528
With an expert like me teaching you,
it'll take just an hour

772
01:18:01,905 --> 01:18:04,635
An hour? I'll go and
get a boat in a minute!

773
01:18:07,044 --> 01:18:11,037
Take it off

774
01:18:14,418 --> 01:18:20,379
Beautiful. Very beautiful!
Very fine figure!

775
01:18:21,525 --> 01:18:23,857
You have a slender waist!

776
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,556
Won't help you to feel shy
with your instructor

777
01:18:29,867 --> 01:18:33,496
I can see it all. Your face,
your figure, your heart...

778
01:18:34,347 --> 01:18:37,942
you're in love?
- What do you mean?

779
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:42,080
I mean, those in love cannot swim

780
01:18:42,355 --> 01:18:45,688
The beloved's face swims before
their eyes... all day and night

781
01:18:46,325 --> 01:18:49,158
Shut up and go away!
- You're angry?

782
01:18:49,528 --> 01:18:53,225
Which means there's something
wrong with your love!

783
01:18:53,532 --> 01:18:55,022
I'm not going to teach you
any swimming

784
01:18:55,334 --> 01:18:58,701
What I'll give you
is a lesson in love

785
01:19:09,615 --> 01:19:11,674
Come on!

786
01:20:02,735 --> 01:20:06,899
"My love..."

787
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,108
"Cast a look at me"

788
01:20:12,144 --> 01:20:15,011
"From the skies I descend..."

789
01:20:15,348 --> 01:20:18,112
"to give you lessons in love"

790
01:20:18,351 --> 01:20:24,586
"In my heart is my beloved's picture.
I come to show it to you"

791
01:20:24,857 --> 01:20:27,693
"From the skies I descend..."

792
01:20:27,693 --> 01:20:30,856
"to give you lessons in love"

793
01:20:31,197 --> 01:20:37,136
"In my heart is my beloved's picture,
I come to show it to you"

794
01:20:37,303 --> 01:20:39,567
"Say you love me"

795
01:20:39,739 --> 01:20:40,501
"Go away"

796
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,298
"Say you love me, my love"

797
01:20:42,508 --> 01:20:43,532
"Go away"

798
01:21:06,298 --> 01:21:12,168
"Learn from me,
ways of falling in love"

799
01:21:12,938 --> 01:21:19,138
"Tell me that you're
in love with me"

800
01:21:22,415 --> 01:21:28,251
"Learn from me,
ways of falling in love"

801
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:35,019
"Tell me that you're
in love with me"

802
01:21:35,461 --> 01:21:38,396
"From the skies I descend..."

803
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:41,825
"to give you lessons in love"

804
01:21:42,034 --> 01:21:47,939
"In my heart is my beloved's picture,
I come to show it to you"

805
01:21:48,174 --> 01:21:49,539
"Say you love me"

806
01:21:49,842 --> 01:21:50,810
"Go away"

807
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:52,869
"Say you love me, my love"

808
01:21:53,145 --> 01:21:54,112
"Go away"

809
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,200
"My love, for you..."

810
01:22:24,443 --> 01:22:26,775
"I have left the Moon behind"

811
01:22:27,913 --> 01:22:28,743
"To give you..."

812
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:33,517
"I have brought my love
as a present"

813
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:40,186
"My love, for you..."

814
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:43,326
"I have left the Moon behind"

815
01:22:43,696 --> 01:22:46,460
"To give you..."

816
01:22:46,799 --> 01:22:49,131
"I have brought my love
as a present"

817
01:22:50,035 --> 01:22:53,198
"From the skies I descend..."

818
01:22:53,405 --> 01:22:56,465
"to give you lessons in love"

819
01:22:56,709 --> 01:23:02,614
"In my heart is my beloved's picture,
I come to show it to you"

820
01:23:02,915 --> 01:23:04,212
"Say you love me"

821
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:05,777
"Silly"

822
01:23:06,085 --> 01:23:07,575
"Say you love me, my love"

823
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:08,878
"Don't be silly"

824
01:23:31,544 --> 01:23:33,978
"Like a shadow..."

825
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,078
"I will always remain with you"

826
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:40,146
"I'm your lover"

827
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:43,317
"I'll carry you away in my arms"

828
01:23:46,926 --> 01:23:49,622
"Like a shadow..."

829
01:23:49,929 --> 01:23:52,830
"I will always remain with you"

830
01:23:53,165 --> 01:23:55,929
"I'm your lover"

831
01:23:56,201 --> 01:23:59,170
"I'll carry you away in my arms"

832
01:23:59,505 --> 01:24:02,668
"From the skies I descend..."

833
01:24:02,942 --> 01:24:05,740
"to give you lessons in love"

834
01:24:06,145 --> 01:24:11,879
"In my heart is my beloved's picture,
I come to show it to you"

835
01:24:12,217 --> 01:24:14,014
"Say you love me"

836
01:24:14,853 --> 01:24:15,615
"Say you love me"

837
01:24:18,057 --> 01:24:20,082
"Say you love me"

838
01:24:20,426 --> 01:24:20,859
"Yes"

839
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:23,020
"Say you love me, my love"

840
01:24:23,295 --> 01:24:24,284
"Oh yes"

841
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:25,831
"Say you love me, my love"

842
01:24:25,831 --> 01:24:27,389
"I said so"

843
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,099
"Say you love me"

844
01:24:29,401 --> 01:24:30,459
"Oh yes, I am"

845
01:24:30,769 --> 01:24:32,828
"Say you love me"

846
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:47,130
What are you staring at?
They've gone

847
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,898
And they've taught us a lesson too

848
01:24:50,102 --> 01:24:53,731
A girl who doesn't agree,
ought to be carried away

849
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:54,902
Makhan Singh! Let's return

850
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,310
Makhan Singh isn't going
to be cowed down today

851
01:24:58,811 --> 01:25:02,076
You are with me, I have the boat

852
01:25:02,715 --> 01:25:05,384
I have desires, and there's
a storm in my heart!

853
01:25:05,384 --> 01:25:07,818
Let's go! Hurry!

854
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:11,680
Makhan Singh's in a great mood today

855
01:26:16,389 --> 01:26:17,617
It was great fun!

856
01:26:20,026 --> 01:26:22,290
Come on, Honey!
The weather's so funny!

857
01:26:22,728 --> 01:26:24,320
Why have you brought me
to this scary place?

858
01:26:24,997 --> 01:26:31,163
Scary? Even as a kid, I dreamed of
bringing you to this romantic spot

859
01:26:31,537 --> 01:26:34,802
There's silence everywhere...
no one around to slap me either!

860
01:26:35,141 --> 01:26:37,871
You and I...
Iost in our love

861
01:26:38,344 --> 01:26:40,437
Listen, moron!
- Who the hell is that?

862
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:46,217
Where has the other girl gone?

863
01:26:46,986 --> 01:26:49,079
What's that to you?
Are you her uncle?

864
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:53,555
Makhan Singh, he has a pistol!
- It's a toy gun

865
01:26:53,859 --> 01:26:55,793
It'll only make a noise.
I'll get rid of him

866
01:26:56,095 --> 01:26:57,426
Get lost! Go away!

867
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:02,056
Now where's a smaller stone?

868
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:06,862
Makhan Singh!
What happened to you?

869
01:27:08,774 --> 01:27:10,708
So you have a real pistol?

870
01:27:12,178 --> 01:27:14,806
Go ahead and fire.
Provided it's not at us

871
01:27:15,181 --> 01:27:16,808
What are you doing, Makhan Singh!

872
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:20,078
What are you up to?
Have you gone mad?

873
01:27:20,786 --> 01:27:24,654
One shot is fired,
and you cling to me

874
01:27:24,957 --> 01:27:27,983
If there 10 or 15 shots,
I'll have it worked out!

875
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:32,292
What's this?

876
01:27:32,732 --> 01:27:35,166
Quietly tell me where
I will find the girl

877
01:27:35,568 --> 01:27:36,899
Hurry up! Else, I'll shoot!

878
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:38,902
Paris

879
01:27:39,271 --> 01:27:41,865
Put that gun away
and head for Paris

880
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:11,969
See that?
- Let's go

881
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:20,069
What's there to feel shy about?
That's the custom here

882
01:28:20,513 --> 01:28:23,880
Boy meets girl, they fall in love

883
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:27,944
The boy proposes to her, puts
an engagement ring on her finger...

884
01:28:28,187 --> 01:28:28,915
and then...

885
01:28:31,557 --> 01:28:32,785
What do you think?

886
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:39,024
The boy proposes, puts an engagement
ring on her finger and then...

887
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:42,061
All right

888
01:28:52,044 --> 01:28:54,342
Big favor you're doing to me!
Look, I got this just for you

889
01:29:03,622 --> 01:29:04,589
How about it?

890
01:29:07,093 --> 01:29:07,855
No

891
01:29:08,861 --> 01:29:09,759
Why not?

892
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:14,465
I'm an Indian girl. According
to our customs, all this...

893
01:29:14,834 --> 01:29:18,827
it'll happen after marriage.
- So we must marry soon

894
01:29:19,405 --> 01:29:20,838
Never mind. Till then...

895
01:30:10,556 --> 01:30:12,080
I'm exhausted!
- Already?

896
01:30:12,558 --> 01:30:15,925
We've still got to see the fireworks
and spend the night on the streets

897
01:30:16,295 --> 01:30:18,229
What for?
- People here don't go to sleep

898
01:30:18,464 --> 01:30:19,931
They sing and dance.
Make merry

899
01:30:20,232 --> 01:30:24,601
And what do you intend to do?
- Anything your heart says

900
01:30:25,004 --> 01:30:30,408
My heart? It's yours now
- How about my heart?

901
01:30:30,743 --> 01:30:32,608
I won't tell you

902
01:30:33,979 --> 01:30:37,107
I will! At the top of my voice!
From rooftops!

903
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,520
"My heart belongs to you"

904
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,857
"Your heart belongs to me"

905
01:30:58,103 --> 01:31:00,571
"My heart belongs to you"

906
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,773
"Your heart belongs to me"

907
01:31:03,108 --> 01:31:07,408
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

908
01:31:07,947 --> 01:31:12,543
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

909
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:40,708
"For this moment,
I have waited so much"

910
01:31:41,013 --> 01:31:45,746
"My eyes craved for a loving look"

911
01:31:50,489 --> 01:31:55,153
"For this moment,
I have waited so much"

912
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:59,887
"My eyes craved for a loving look"

913
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:04,727
"My eyes craved
for a loving look..."

914
01:32:07,373 --> 01:32:09,898
"My heart belongs to you"

915
01:32:10,276 --> 01:32:12,073
"Your heart belongs to me"

916
01:32:12,378 --> 01:32:16,815
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

917
01:32:17,383 --> 01:32:22,184
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

918
01:32:50,382 --> 01:32:55,012
"Let our hearts be lost
in a world crazily in love"

919
01:32:55,321 --> 01:33:00,156
"We're mad at heart...
let's get madder"

920
01:33:04,596 --> 01:33:09,397
"Let our hearts be lost
in a world crazily in love"

921
01:33:09,702 --> 01:33:14,230
"We're mad at heart...
let's get madder"

922
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:20,310
"We're mad at heart...
let's get loonier"

923
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:23,946
"My heart belongs to you"

924
01:33:24,249 --> 01:33:26,274
"Your heart belongs to me"

925
01:33:26,618 --> 01:33:30,850
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

926
01:33:31,457 --> 01:33:35,917
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

927
01:33:59,818 --> 01:34:04,312
"Let's sing and dance,
everywhere we go"

928
01:34:04,656 --> 01:34:09,684
"Let there be a cloudburst
of joy today"

929
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:18,830
"Let's sing and dance,
everywhere we go"

930
01:34:19,138 --> 01:34:23,598
"Let there be a cloudburst
of joy today"

931
01:34:24,009 --> 01:34:28,605
"Let there be a cloudburst
of joy today"

932
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:33,551
"My heart belongs to you"

933
01:34:33,852 --> 01:34:35,877
"Your heart belongs to me"

934
01:34:36,321 --> 01:34:40,621
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

935
01:34:40,993 --> 01:34:45,521
"Ever since we have exchanged hearts,
the world seems to have changed"

936
01:34:55,088 --> 01:34:58,489
Recognize me?
- With Jack, the other day?

937
01:34:58,758 --> 01:35:01,249
I couldn't talk to you because
Jack was around the other day

938
01:35:01,561 --> 01:35:03,859
And say what?
- About your benefit

939
01:35:04,397 --> 01:35:06,763
What does that mean?
- It involves millions

940
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:11,200
There are millions we could
lay our hands on

941
01:35:11,538 --> 01:35:12,368
We?

942
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:20,401
You resemble that girl to the t.
- I've heard that

943
01:35:20,813 --> 01:35:24,442
Jack's going to kidnap her.
- I've heard that too

944
01:35:25,485 --> 01:35:28,045
As soon as that girl disappears,
you will step into her shoes

945
01:35:28,588 --> 01:35:33,616
This, I haven't heard of.
Jack didn't say a word to me

946
01:35:34,327 --> 01:35:37,922
Jack doesn't know anything about it.
It's my plan

947
01:35:39,866 --> 01:35:41,959
I don't have the courage
to go against Jack

948
01:35:42,302 --> 01:35:47,239
Neither have I. But do you like
the idea of being terrified of Jack...

949
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,064
and dancing to his tunes
all our lives?

950
01:35:50,343 --> 01:35:52,868
No. But do we have an option?

951
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:57,673
Join me. In just a week,
we'll turn millionaires

952
01:35:58,651 --> 01:36:01,984
As soon as we have the money,
we'll no longer be scared of Jack

953
01:36:02,755 --> 01:36:08,125
We'll go somewhere far away.
Someplace he can't ever get us

954
01:36:08,428 --> 01:36:10,020
The danger exists only as long as
we get our hands on the money

955
01:36:10,296 --> 01:36:11,661
Once we have the money, we can
buy our way out of the danger

956
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,292
What will my share be?
- Half the loot

957
01:36:15,835 --> 01:36:19,430
How much is it in cash?
- At least a million dollars

958
01:36:21,741 --> 01:36:24,505
If you need time to decide...
- I've decided

959
01:36:25,211 --> 01:36:26,303
I'm with you

960
01:36:47,767 --> 01:36:49,291
That's Deepa

961
01:36:56,509 --> 01:37:00,104
She looks exactly like me...
there's no difference at all

962
01:37:00,413 --> 01:37:01,675
Take a good look at her

963
01:37:02,215 --> 01:37:04,877
Even her father mustn't be able
to tell the difference

964
01:37:07,887 --> 01:37:08,876
He won't

965
01:39:09,809 --> 01:39:14,405
This is enough, Shekhar. We don't
need to follow them anymore

966
01:39:15,114 --> 01:39:18,242
Have you studied her gait, her
way of talking and mannerisms?

967
01:39:29,896 --> 01:39:31,796
What childishness is this?
What happened?

968
01:39:31,964 --> 01:39:33,556
Let me go!
- But what happened?

969
01:39:34,133 --> 01:39:37,796
As if you don't know. Why were you
so interested in that girl?

970
01:39:38,137 --> 01:39:40,332
And you were offended
at such a little thing?

971
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:43,871
Little thing?
- I just lit a cigarette for her

972
01:39:44,243 --> 01:39:47,007
By looking deep into her eyes?

973
01:39:49,649 --> 01:39:52,049
So you even get jealous, do you?

974
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:55,045
Only those in love
will feel jealous

975
01:39:55,521 --> 01:40:00,652
I wasn't jealous when you clung
to Shekhar in Switzerland

976
01:40:02,295 --> 01:40:09,064
Sam, please don't remind me of that.
I want to forget it

977
01:40:11,237 --> 01:40:13,330
And what do you want to remember?

978
01:40:18,044 --> 01:40:24,176
This ring. It gave the true love
I always looked for

979
01:40:24,817 --> 01:40:27,479
For which I traveled here
from India

980
01:40:28,521 --> 01:40:32,981
And your journey is over?
- No. It will now begin

981
01:41:29,215 --> 01:41:33,481
"O companion for the night..."

982
01:41:33,819 --> 01:41:38,017
"where are we going?"

983
01:41:38,424 --> 01:41:47,799
"The dawn of love
is about to arrive"

984
01:41:48,134 --> 01:41:57,270
"With the dazzling light
of beauty ahead..."

985
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:07,212
"dawn is turning away"

986
01:42:30,309 --> 01:42:34,837
"Those asleep, we must awaken"

987
01:42:35,181 --> 01:42:39,208
"Those awake, we must put to sleep"

988
01:42:39,518 --> 01:42:43,921
"To keep us awake..."

989
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:48,556
"To keep us awake..."

990
01:42:48,894 --> 01:42:53,627
"dawn sings a beautiful lullaby"

991
01:42:53,933 --> 01:42:58,029
"O companion for the night..."

992
01:42:58,337 --> 01:43:02,296
"we're tired, we're headed home"

993
01:43:02,742 --> 01:43:12,117
"The dawn of love
is about to arrive"

994
01:43:12,418 --> 01:43:21,417
"With the dazzling light
of beauty ahead..."

995
01:43:21,761 --> 01:43:30,999
"dawn is turning away"

996
01:43:59,131 --> 01:44:03,568
"Goblets of passion,
the night gave us"

997
01:44:03,903 --> 01:44:08,272
"You and I are drunk
on each other's eyes"

998
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:12,841
"Our senses haven't
yet been restored..."

999
01:44:13,446 --> 01:44:17,746
"Our senses haven't
yet been restored..."

1000
01:44:18,017 --> 01:44:22,647
"so what else does
the dawn of love offer us?"

1001
01:44:22,955 --> 01:44:26,891
"O companion..."

1002
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:31,459
"where are we going?"

1003
01:44:31,797 --> 01:44:41,104
"The dawn of love
is about to arrive"

1004
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:50,439
"With the dazzling light
of beauty ahead..."

1005
01:44:50,816 --> 01:44:59,986
"dawn is turning away"

1006
01:45:23,582 --> 01:45:28,451
"What promises did we make?
What did we swear by?"

1007
01:45:28,721 --> 01:45:32,657
"On a new path,
we have now embarked"

1008
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:37,190
"No matter how much
we hide our love..."

1009
01:45:37,596 --> 01:45:41,896
"No matter how much
we hide our love..."

1010
01:45:42,201 --> 01:45:46,729
"the dawn of love
knows it all"

1011
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:51,203
"O beloved..."

1012
01:45:51,544 --> 01:45:55,810
"we're tired. We're going home"

1013
01:45:56,148 --> 01:46:01,313
"The dawn of love..."

1014
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:27,765
Tired?
- No

1015
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,970
Feeling sleepy?
- No

1016
01:46:34,045 --> 01:46:39,950
Paris is a strange place. You never
know when it's day or night

1017
01:46:40,618 --> 01:46:42,176
And you also don't know
when you fall in love

1018
01:46:46,024 --> 01:46:48,686
Guess what people here do
when they fall in love?

1019
01:46:49,394 --> 01:46:52,886
What?
- They have French onion soup

1020
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:05,234
You're with Deepa?

1021
01:47:06,211 --> 01:47:08,839
You've conned me to
have her for yourself

1022
01:47:09,147 --> 01:47:12,378
I'm angry with you. You are
no longer my Indian friend!

1023
01:47:13,985 --> 01:47:17,318
Indian friend?
- A liar and a betrayer!

1024
01:47:18,323 --> 01:47:22,817
But he's a Frenchman
- I'm French. He's Indian!

1025
01:47:23,261 --> 01:47:25,092
What does that mean?
- He's lying

1026
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:28,827
Am I really? You're the liar!
Look at his passport!

1027
01:47:28,933 --> 01:47:29,922
Take a look

1028
01:47:31,936 --> 01:47:37,568
Shyam Kumar, Lucknow, India

1029
01:47:38,576 --> 01:47:42,512
Shyam Kumar alias Mr. Sam,
alias the fake Frenchman!

1030
01:47:42,847 --> 01:47:46,146
Liar, cheat, betrayer!
- How have I deceived you?

1031
01:47:46,551 --> 01:47:49,145
You've made a fool out of me!
- Not at all. On the contrary...

1032
01:47:49,487 --> 01:47:52,251
I've shown you that Indian boys
are capable of being truly in love

1033
01:47:52,523 --> 01:47:55,083
Shut up! I don't even want
to see your face again!

1034
01:47:56,494 --> 01:48:00,021
You love me, don't you?
- Let me go!

1035
01:48:06,337 --> 01:48:08,771
I'm going to beat you to pulp!

1036
01:49:03,761 --> 01:49:06,229
Deepa has been kidnapped.
You are Deepa now

1037
01:49:07,165 --> 01:49:10,134
Till her father arrives,
nobody must get suspicious

1038
01:49:10,535 --> 01:49:15,097
They won't.
But I'm only afraid of Sam

1039
01:49:15,473 --> 01:49:18,442
Sam? He's blinded.
- What?

1040
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:22,168
Blinded by love. You can easily
lead him up the path

1041
01:49:22,547 --> 01:49:25,380
Besides, you know what Deepa
and he were up to anyway

1042
01:49:43,468 --> 01:49:46,835
Are you okay?
- What's the police for?

1043
01:49:48,439 --> 01:49:52,205
I got a call at the office
telling me that...

1044
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:53,977
that someone called Jack
has kidnapped you

1045
01:49:54,345 --> 01:49:57,075
He asked for a ransom of a million
dollars for your safe return

1046
01:49:58,616 --> 01:50:01,983
Is that all? Only a million?
- This is no time for jokes

1047
01:50:02,353 --> 01:50:06,187
The police tell me that Jack is
the most dreaded gangster in Europe

1048
01:50:06,524 --> 01:50:11,427
But he hasn't kidnapped me yet.
So why do we need them?

1049
01:50:17,135 --> 01:50:19,899
You ought to be careful, dear.
I was very scared

1050
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:22,297
What would I tell your father
if something had happened to you?

1051
01:50:22,573 --> 01:50:26,270
Just don't get worried, uncle.
Go on

1052
01:50:40,491 --> 01:50:43,085
If you could fool my father...

1053
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:45,828
it's easy to con
Deepa's father

1054
01:50:46,164 --> 01:50:48,598
I have no doubt that we'll
soon be millionaires

1055
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:52,168
But there's time.
- Just a few days

1056
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:55,629
It isn't right for me to come here.
I'll be leaving now

1057
01:50:55,907 --> 01:50:57,135
I'll give you a call, if need be

1058
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:30,566
Who is it?
- Shyam

1059
01:51:30,875 --> 01:51:35,209
Alias Sam. Alias Hukum Pasha.
Alias Deepak Sen.

1060
01:51:35,513 --> 01:51:36,810
It's me

1061
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:40,248
For me?

1062
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:45,851
Lovely? You mean, no get out?
- What?

1063
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:50,320
I thought you'd call me names and be
angry and that I'd have to pacify you

1064
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:54,429
What for?
- Aren't you angry with me?

1065
01:51:55,733 --> 01:51:58,793
Can I ever be angry with you?
- So what was it yesterday?

1066
01:51:59,103 --> 01:52:01,298
Yesterday? Let's forget about it

1067
01:52:01,706 --> 01:52:03,731
What happened yesterday
is in the past

1068
01:52:04,909 --> 01:52:08,504
Deepa, did you never suspect
that I'm an Indian?

1069
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:10,312
No

1070
01:52:10,781 --> 01:52:12,544
Know why I had to pretend
to be a Frenchman?

1071
01:52:15,219 --> 01:52:18,620
To prove to you that an Indian
is really capable of loving

1072
01:52:19,924 --> 01:52:21,482
I was convinced long ago

1073
01:52:22,593 --> 01:52:24,288
Ever since I met you

1074
01:52:25,596 --> 01:52:28,793
Are you okay?
- What do you think?

1075
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:31,125
I'm scared! You never got
so close to me!

1076
01:52:32,003 --> 01:52:33,027
Sit down

1077
01:52:35,907 --> 01:52:39,035
Sam, take me out today

1078
01:52:39,744 --> 01:52:42,178
Sure, I will

1079
01:52:42,813 --> 01:52:45,008
I'll go and get ready

1080
01:52:52,023 --> 01:52:53,081
Who's been here?

1081
01:52:54,358 --> 01:52:55,689
No one

1082
01:52:56,861 --> 01:52:58,158
Whose cigarette is this?

1083
01:52:59,964 --> 01:53:02,262
Oh yes, Uncle was here

1084
01:53:03,267 --> 01:53:05,735
This one is still lit.
- Lit?

1085
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:10,139
He was here a little while
before you came in

1086
01:53:34,065 --> 01:53:35,157
Why're you stopped here?

1087
01:53:35,733 --> 01:53:37,963
I've got to meet Louis.
He has a darkroom in that house there

1088
01:53:41,472 --> 01:53:42,700
Oh yes

1089
01:53:44,675 --> 01:53:46,905
Strange! Yesterday, you were
angry with me because of him

1090
01:53:47,211 --> 01:53:49,543
And now you speak as if
you don't even know him!

1091
01:53:50,147 --> 01:53:51,409
I don't like that man

1092
01:53:52,283 --> 01:53:55,275
Let's talk about something else.
About you and me

1093
01:53:58,089 --> 01:54:02,822
You've changed a lot in a day.
- How come?

1094
01:54:04,528 --> 01:54:07,053
There's a world of a difference between
the Deepa of yesterday and today

1095
01:54:07,398 --> 01:54:11,232
Yes, there is. And you are
the one who's responsible

1096
01:54:11,869 --> 01:54:13,200
I?

1097
01:54:14,271 --> 01:54:17,729
I love you more than I
loved you yesterday

1098
01:54:19,744 --> 01:54:20,676
Why?

1099
01:54:21,345 --> 01:54:24,041
I was angry yesterday.
And instead of taking offense...

1100
01:54:24,382 --> 01:54:26,714
you brought so many flowers for me.
- Is that why!

1101
01:54:27,018 --> 01:54:29,646
I thought it was the engagement ring...
- Engagement ring?

1102
01:54:32,556 --> 01:54:36,652
Where is it?
- I threw it away in a fit of anger

1103
01:54:37,762 --> 01:54:40,731
Good thing too. It was Sam who
put the ring on you yesterday

1104
01:54:41,098 --> 01:54:43,362
Today, Shyam will do it

1105
01:54:45,336 --> 01:54:46,564
Don't lose this one, okay?

1106
01:54:49,573 --> 01:54:52,542
Remember what I said yesterday?
- I do

1107
01:54:53,177 --> 01:54:56,476
But I'd like to hear it again.
- Just that boy meets girl...

1108
01:54:56,881 --> 01:55:01,284
they fall in love, the boy proposes,
makes her wear the ring...

1109
01:55:01,619 --> 01:55:04,019
and then...
- Then?

1110
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:08,215
This is where I stopped yesterday.
- Didn't you say...

1111
01:55:08,759 --> 01:55:11,284
there's a world of a difference
between yesterday and today?

1112
01:55:13,631 --> 01:55:15,292
Let there be no distance today

1113
01:55:15,733 --> 01:55:19,225
Let the sky and the earth meet

1114
01:55:26,444 --> 01:55:27,741
What happened?

1115
01:55:28,145 --> 01:55:32,912
We're Indians. We don't do
these things before marriage

1116
01:55:46,964 --> 01:55:49,023
Come, let's go

1117
01:55:55,406 --> 01:55:58,307
Damodar...
- Sethji! You?

1118
01:55:58,642 --> 01:56:00,234
Hello Damodar.
- Hello

1119
01:56:00,945 --> 01:56:03,539
Deepa wasn't at the flat.
So I came here

1120
01:56:03,981 --> 01:56:06,916
What brings you here suddenly?
- You sent me a cable...

1121
01:56:07,218 --> 01:56:08,708
to come over immediately.
And I came over

1122
01:56:09,053 --> 01:56:12,045
I didn't send any cable.
- Didn't you?

1123
01:56:12,523 --> 01:56:14,548
So who sent it?
- I did

1124
01:56:16,927 --> 01:56:19,862
So you sent the cable?
- Yes, sir. In daddy's name

1125
01:56:21,532 --> 01:56:23,591
It was a delicate matter and
I wanted you to be here

1126
01:56:23,901 --> 01:56:28,065
What is the matter?
- I want to marry your daughter

1127
01:56:28,472 --> 01:56:29,336
What?

1128
01:56:29,974 --> 01:56:33,137
We're in love with each other and
Deepa has consented to the wedding

1129
01:56:33,677 --> 01:56:35,542
This is impossible!

1130
01:56:36,347 --> 01:56:39,316
You can ask your daughter.
- I certainly will

1131
01:56:39,717 --> 01:56:42,584
I just can't believe that Deepa
has decided to get married!

1132
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:47,289
What?
- I was fed up of reasoning with her

1133
01:56:47,691 --> 01:56:52,287
She just didn't approve of anyone.
And if wants to marry Shekhar...

1134
01:56:52,696 --> 01:56:54,926
I'm very happy about it.
- Sethji!

1135
01:56:55,699 --> 01:56:59,396
Shekhar is my son, no doubt.
But worthy of Deepa...

1136
01:56:59,737 --> 01:57:01,602
I can't find a better match!

1137
01:57:02,139 --> 01:57:05,631
Damodar, you have looked after
my business all these years

1138
01:57:06,043 --> 01:57:08,637
Shekhar will now look after it.
Go and make a call, son

1139
01:57:08,946 --> 01:57:11,779
Check whether Deepa has returned.
We must finalize this immediately

1140
01:57:12,082 --> 01:57:15,483
What's the hurry? By tomorrow morning...
- Who knows?

1141
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:19,551
Deepa might change her mind.
You don't know my daughter, Damodar

1142
01:57:19,857 --> 01:57:22,052
I'll call Deepa over.
- Go ahead. Hurry up

1143
01:57:44,048 --> 01:57:45,948
Suzy?
- Who's this?

1144
01:57:58,796 --> 01:58:00,354
When did you return?
- Right now

1145
01:58:00,664 --> 01:58:05,328
What's up? Your skin is glowing.
And what's this?

1146
01:58:05,936 --> 01:58:07,528
This is an engagement ring

1147
01:58:08,172 --> 01:58:11,232
Thank you, Deepaji.
- What for?

1148
01:58:11,575 --> 01:58:15,011
You left us in Beirut and
it strengthened our love

1149
01:58:15,779 --> 01:58:17,406
Congratulations.
- Thank you

1150
01:58:17,481 --> 01:58:19,813
Where's he?
- Over there

1151
01:58:20,651 --> 01:58:24,018
My line's now engaged, feller.
How about yours?

1152
01:58:24,388 --> 01:58:27,448
Makhan, I've some work with you.
I'll be back, Deepa

1153
01:58:27,858 --> 01:58:31,055
Come back soon. We must celebrate
Honey's engagement

1154
01:58:31,428 --> 01:58:33,089
I'll be back, Honey

1155
01:58:37,101 --> 01:58:38,693
Do you know where the
manager's office is?

1156
01:58:39,003 --> 01:58:40,800
Sure, I do.
- Take me there. Quick

1157
01:58:41,105 --> 01:58:41,901
What's wrong?

1158
01:58:43,674 --> 01:58:46,268
Deepa's telephone appears to be dead.
I'll personally go and bring her

1159
01:58:48,279 --> 01:58:49,541
Relax. I'll take it

1160
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:55,077
Damodar Dayal?

1161
01:58:57,855 --> 01:58:59,117
This is the last warning

1162
01:58:59,623 --> 01:59:02,057
If you still don't agree to pay us
a million dollars...

1163
01:59:02,526 --> 01:59:07,327
Deepa will be finished this evening.
- Finish her

1164
01:59:10,801 --> 01:59:12,792
He's asking us to finish her

1165
01:59:20,144 --> 01:59:21,634
Something is surely wrong
out there

1166
01:59:22,579 --> 01:59:25,047
Leave for Paris immediately and
give me a call from there

1167
01:59:29,019 --> 01:59:33,513
Shekhar... is your daddy in?
- Yes. What happened?

1168
01:59:33,824 --> 01:59:37,521
Can't tell you. Deepa's...
- Makhan Singh. Let's go.

1169
01:59:45,836 --> 01:59:49,101
What?
- The girl in your flat is not Deepa

1170
01:59:49,473 --> 01:59:53,170
But she looks just like Deepa.
As if she were a twin

1171
01:59:55,179 --> 01:59:58,171
Twin?
- Had I not known your daughter well...

1172
01:59:58,482 --> 01:59:59,915
I'd have been deceived too

1173
02:00:05,589 --> 02:00:09,855
Damodar! Could Roopa still
possibly be alive?

1174
02:00:10,427 --> 02:00:13,260
Roopa? Who's that?

1175
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:20,832
Deepa's twin sister.
Twenty years ago, after my wife died...

1176
02:00:22,006 --> 02:00:26,409
I came to Europe with
both my daughters

1177
02:00:28,045 --> 02:00:32,175
I found an Indian servant
to look after them

1178
02:00:32,716 --> 02:00:38,518
But I didn't know that he was
a gambler and a drunkard

1179
02:00:39,156 --> 02:00:40,384
One evening...

1180
02:00:45,662 --> 02:00:49,723
Jaggu! Where've you been all day?
- I was held up somewhere

1181
02:00:50,067 --> 02:00:54,265
Jaggu! You're drunk!
- I've had a little

1182
02:00:54,538 --> 02:00:57,063
I've hired you to take care
of my children, Jaggu

1183
02:00:59,076 --> 02:01:01,510
It's not for you to go berserk.
- Don't bully me, mister

1184
02:01:01,779 --> 02:01:03,747
This is Europe. It isn't India

1185
02:01:04,281 --> 02:01:07,876
You could face dangerous consequences
for throwing your weight around

1186
02:01:08,152 --> 02:01:09,949
You're threatening me?
Get out!

1187
02:01:10,454 --> 02:01:12,854
Settle my accounts, mister.
Right now

1188
02:01:17,127 --> 02:01:21,063
Mister, you're going to regret this

1189
02:01:32,209 --> 02:01:35,406
That very night, when both
my daughters were asleep...

1190
02:01:36,447 --> 02:01:41,475
I couldn't go to sleep
and was reading a book

1191
02:01:42,386 --> 02:01:44,411
I suddenly heard a scream

1192
02:01:50,094 --> 02:01:51,994
Jaggu! Wait there!

1193
02:01:58,669 --> 02:02:02,571
Deepa was saved. But there was
no trace of Roopa and Jaggu

1194
02:02:02,873 --> 02:02:05,774
One moment...
I've heard the name Jaggu before

1195
02:02:06,477 --> 02:02:09,503
In Switzerland!
When you called Shekhar

1196
02:02:10,447 --> 02:02:15,749
Manager, where's your son right now?
- My son? I don't know. Why ask?

1197
02:02:16,053 --> 02:02:17,452
He knows a thug called Jaggu.

1198
02:02:19,323 --> 02:02:22,724
Jaggu's boss is someone called Jack.
- Jack?

1199
02:02:24,228 --> 02:02:25,923
Jack threatened me over the phone

1200
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:29,030
Jaggu and Roopa!
After all these years!

1201
02:02:29,433 --> 02:02:32,493
What's happening here?
- I'm baffled too

1202
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:37,464
If the girl I spoke to at
Deepa's place isn't Deepa...

1203
02:02:37,774 --> 02:02:40,368
It's Roopa then!
It can't be anybody else!

1204
02:02:40,811 --> 02:02:44,406
God has saved her for me!
- Only she knows where Deepa is

1205
02:02:44,748 --> 02:02:45,612
Yes!

1206
02:02:46,783 --> 02:02:48,273
We must go and
meet her right now

1207
02:03:00,297 --> 02:03:02,492
Who's that?
- This is Deepa here

1208
02:03:02,799 --> 02:03:05,029
Suzy, take the back door and
come downstairs immediately

1209
02:03:05,302 --> 02:03:06,132
Why?

1210
02:03:06,503 --> 02:03:08,698
I'll explain later.
Just get out of there. Quick!

1211
02:03:09,072 --> 02:03:09,902
But...

1212
02:03:11,208 --> 02:03:13,073
Makhan Singh, wait here

1213
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:14,534
Call me later

1214
02:03:29,693 --> 02:03:31,183
Do you know him, Deepa?

1215
02:03:34,231 --> 02:03:37,223
My father. He wanted to meet you
before we get married

1216
02:03:38,168 --> 02:03:39,192
Greetings

1217
02:03:43,907 --> 02:03:45,704
I'm Deepa.
- A fake Deepa

1218
02:03:47,945 --> 02:03:50,470
Because he's the
real Deepa's father

1219
02:03:51,949 --> 02:03:54,577
But you just said...

1220
02:03:54,818 --> 02:03:56,479
I had to prove that
you are not Deepa

1221
02:03:56,820 --> 02:04:00,415
So who am I?
- My lost daughter. Roopa

1222
02:04:00,824 --> 02:04:02,189
Deepa's twin sister

1223
02:04:03,794 --> 02:04:08,629
I'm sorry, but you're
making a mistake

1224
02:04:09,333 --> 02:04:13,360
Mother, father, brothers and sisters
are words alien to me

1225
02:04:13,837 --> 02:04:17,273
I have no one. I'm all alone
in the world

1226
02:04:17,574 --> 02:04:20,372
No, you can't be anybody
but my daughter

1227
02:04:20,744 --> 02:04:22,974
Why not? I'm Suzy

1228
02:04:23,213 --> 02:04:25,078
I'm known at every
night club of Europe

1229
02:04:25,415 --> 02:04:27,815
Nightclubs? What do you do there?

1230
02:04:28,118 --> 02:04:30,018
I sing and dance
and make money!

1231
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,049
No!
- Why not?

1232
02:04:32,456 --> 02:04:35,892
It is my profession.
Any more questions?

1233
02:04:36,193 --> 02:04:38,684
Yes. Why did you pose as Deepa
and stay here?

1234
02:04:40,430 --> 02:04:43,831
Sam, I want to have a
word with you in privacy

1235
02:04:44,134 --> 02:04:45,795
Where is Deepa?
- I don't know

1236
02:04:46,169 --> 02:04:48,467
Damodar, telephone the
police immediately

1237
02:04:50,774 --> 02:04:53,368
You're right. I made a mistake

1238
02:04:53,744 --> 02:04:56,110
My daughter could never be
a dancing girl

1239
02:04:56,613 --> 02:05:00,777
Hand her over to the police, Shyam!
- Do you want to see Deepa alive?

1240
02:05:01,618 --> 02:05:03,677
D'you know where Deepa is?
- Yes, I do

1241
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:06,320
If you want to find out,
just come with me

1242
02:05:11,461 --> 02:05:13,156
Don't inform the police
till I return

1243
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:34,044
Why have you brought me here?

1244
02:05:34,451 --> 02:05:37,511
Because this is the crossroad

1245
02:05:38,822 --> 02:05:40,653
You'll find it easier
to choose your path

1246
02:05:41,024 --> 02:05:43,117
What does that mean?
- Mean?

1247
02:05:43,927 --> 02:05:45,724
Come, I'll show you

1248
02:05:51,635 --> 02:05:56,663
Sam, before I met you, I spent
my life in night-clubs...

1249
02:05:56,907 --> 02:06:01,344
displaying my body to lustful
and disgusting men

1250
02:06:01,845 --> 02:06:06,805
It was after I met you that I realized
there's another meaning to life

1251
02:06:07,317 --> 02:06:08,341
What are you getting at?

1252
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:14,920
I've fallen in love with you, Sam.
- And you know I'm in love with Deepa

1253
02:06:16,126 --> 02:06:18,788
And you want her to remain alive?
- Where is she?

1254
02:06:21,465 --> 02:06:24,332
That's something only I know

1255
02:06:25,135 --> 02:06:29,265
And you want a price to tell me?
- Naturally

1256
02:06:29,473 --> 02:06:31,441
How much do you want?
200,000? Half a million?

1257
02:06:31,708 --> 02:06:34,905
I want your love. That's all

1258
02:06:37,647 --> 02:06:40,582
Please accept me.
I give you my word...

1259
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:43,712
Deepa will return safely
to her father

1260
02:06:45,222 --> 02:06:48,851
Aren't you his father?
- That man's a stranger to me!

1261
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:51,217
I've never seen him
or stayed with him!

1262
02:06:51,528 --> 02:06:53,996
Have you no sympathies for your sister?
- No!

1263
02:06:54,398 --> 02:06:57,458
I've never known her as my sister.
- And now that you know...

1264
02:06:57,667 --> 02:06:59,157
you're bargaining with me
for her life?

1265
02:07:00,003 --> 02:07:01,095
Only for love

1266
02:07:01,872 --> 02:07:05,569
With your love, I want
to start life afresh

1267
02:07:06,376 --> 02:07:10,972
I want to belong to you, Sam.
- You're not worth it

1268
02:07:11,214 --> 02:07:13,580
Why not? What's the difference
between Deepa and me?

1269
02:07:13,784 --> 02:07:15,411
There's one hell of a difference!
In your shoes...

1270
02:07:15,685 --> 02:07:17,619
she'd have laid down her life
to save her sister!

1271
02:07:18,088 --> 02:07:22,024
The difference between you and Deepa
is what is between real and fake

1272
02:07:22,459 --> 02:07:25,758
As much difference as there is
between light and darkness

1273
02:07:26,096 --> 02:07:27,859
Between a noble man
and a scoundrel!

1274
02:07:28,165 --> 02:07:29,723
Where is Deepa?
Tell me!

1275
02:07:31,034 --> 02:07:33,901
If you change your mind,
come to my hotel

1276
02:07:34,337 --> 02:07:35,634
Tell me, Suzy!

1277
02:08:12,375 --> 02:08:16,368
If you want Deepa to remain alive,
you must pay for it

1278
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:21,307
If you want Deepa to remain alive,
you'll have to pay a price for it

1279
02:08:21,918 --> 02:08:26,082
If you want Deepa to remain alive,
you'll have to pay a price for it

1280
02:08:26,723 --> 02:08:30,887
If you want Deepa to remain alive,
you'll have to pay a price for it

1281
02:08:38,935 --> 02:08:42,427
Come to my hotel,
if you change your mind

1282
02:08:43,106 --> 02:08:46,166
Come to my hotel,
if you change your mind

1283
02:08:46,643 --> 02:08:50,135
Come to my hotel,
if you change your mind

1284
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:53,911
Come to my hotel,
if you change your mind

1285
02:09:36,259 --> 02:09:39,990
"Thanks for coming..."

1286
02:09:40,297 --> 02:09:43,733
"my love"

1287
02:09:44,067 --> 02:09:47,696
"Listen to it, before you leave..."

1288
02:09:47,971 --> 02:09:51,907
"the story of my love"

1289
02:09:52,542 --> 02:09:55,534
"Thanks for coming..."

1290
02:09:55,879 --> 02:09:59,747
"my love"

1291
02:10:07,624 --> 02:10:11,424
"Do not ask how I feel"

1292
02:10:11,695 --> 02:10:13,219
"This gathering is for you..."

1293
02:10:13,563 --> 02:10:15,326
"so please sit down"

1294
02:10:15,632 --> 02:10:17,293
"What's the hurry?"

1295
02:10:17,567 --> 02:10:19,228
"You have just arrived"

1296
02:10:19,536 --> 02:10:23,666
"Enjoy the shade
my tresses give"

1297
02:10:33,550 --> 02:10:36,883
"Thanks for coming..."

1298
02:10:37,187 --> 02:10:40,816
"you are my love"

1299
02:10:48,698 --> 02:10:52,395
"You come for me.
And that is a favor"

1300
02:10:52,636 --> 02:10:56,402
"For you, I'd even
lay down my life"

1301
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:00,406
"Cast a loving glance
at me too..."

1302
02:11:00,677 --> 02:11:04,807
"that's all I want from life"

1303
02:11:14,491 --> 02:11:17,790
"Thanks for coming..."

1304
02:11:18,094 --> 02:11:21,860
"you are my love"

1305
02:11:22,265 --> 02:11:30,001
"So listen to my love-story
before you leave, my love"

1306
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:33,434
"Thanks for coming..."

1307
02:11:33,810 --> 02:11:37,576
"you are my love"

1308
02:12:05,047 --> 02:12:06,708
I knew you'd come

1309
02:12:07,083 --> 02:12:09,278
Wait here. I'll change
and return in a moment

1310
02:12:24,834 --> 02:12:26,495
Sit down, Sam

1311
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:52,090
What have you decided?

1312
02:12:54,163 --> 02:12:56,358
I'll marry you

1313
02:13:00,636 --> 02:13:03,127
Without any conditions?
- You know

1314
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:11,169
Will you undo the zip, please?

1315
02:13:14,083 --> 02:13:18,577
I want you to promise me that Deepa
will return safely

1316
02:13:19,355 --> 02:13:22,586
Is that all? You want
nothing else from me?

1317
02:13:25,428 --> 02:13:31,799
This is exactly why I love you, Sam.
You want nothing from me

1318
02:13:32,335 --> 02:13:35,532
You wanted to marry me.
And I'm willing

1319
02:13:35,871 --> 02:13:36,735
That's enough

1320
02:13:45,815 --> 02:13:49,376
What I sought from you was love.
Not pity!

1321
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:58,117
I'll be in your arms all my life...
but Deepa will live in your heart

1322
02:13:58,594 --> 02:14:00,357
All my life, I'll have the feeling...

1323
02:14:00,596 --> 02:14:02,530
that you accepted me
out of helplessness

1324
02:14:05,935 --> 02:14:08,870
Maybe I'm rotten and cheap.
But I won't stoop...

1325
02:14:09,338 --> 02:14:12,432
to sell my emotions
in the name of marriage

1326
02:14:12,808 --> 02:14:14,139
You may go now

1327
02:14:32,061 --> 02:14:34,393
I'm sorry, I couldn't
get Suzy to agree

1328
02:14:35,297 --> 02:14:39,097
She didn't tell me Deepa's whereabouts.
- I told you to inform the police

1329
02:14:39,402 --> 02:14:41,870
That will endanger her life.
- Her life is already in danger

1330
02:14:43,272 --> 02:14:46,730
I wonder where my daughter is?

1331
02:14:48,444 --> 02:14:51,845
To have her back, I can even
give away all my wealth

1332
02:14:53,082 --> 02:14:55,107
I agree to every condition
those gangsters have

1333
02:14:55,651 --> 02:14:58,677
I'm willing to pay any price
to have Deepa back!

1334
02:14:59,055 --> 02:15:01,250
We only want a million dollars

1335
02:15:01,957 --> 02:15:02,981
Who?

1336
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:04,956
Haven't you recognized me, sir?

1337
02:15:05,494 --> 02:15:08,691
It's your old faithful servant.
Jaggu

1338
02:15:10,733 --> 02:15:11,563
Jaggu! You're still alive?

1339
02:15:12,101 --> 02:15:14,831
Sure, I am.
And so is your daughter

1340
02:15:15,438 --> 02:15:20,034
I wish she were dead!
The state I saw her in...

1341
02:15:20,276 --> 02:15:25,145
Whom did you see?
- Roopa. She calls herself Suzy now

1342
02:15:25,514 --> 02:15:29,280
Suzy? Where did you meet her?
- In Deepa's flat!

1343
02:15:31,420 --> 02:15:34,048
I see. I get it now.
- Ingrate! Scoundrel!

1344
02:15:34,356 --> 02:15:37,189
Where have you kept Deepa?
I'll hand you over to the police!

1345
02:15:38,794 --> 02:15:40,819
You've already lost a daughter

1346
02:15:41,597 --> 02:15:43,064
D'you want to lose
the other one too?

1347
02:15:43,532 --> 02:15:47,229
Jaggu, you know where Deepa is?
- Yes, I do

1348
02:15:47,803 --> 02:15:50,897
If Jack doesn't have a million dollars
by tomorrow evening...

1349
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:53,731
Deepa won't be allowed to live.
- No!

1350
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:58,647
Can we raise a million by tomorrow?
- We can

1351
02:15:58,948 --> 02:16:01,940
One moment. How can you prove
that Deepa's in your custody?

1352
02:16:02,318 --> 02:16:04,752
Proof? Here it is

1353
02:16:11,227 --> 02:16:12,592
It's Deepa's handwriting

1354
02:16:13,195 --> 02:16:15,891
Where and whom have I
to pay the money?

1355
02:16:16,098 --> 02:16:18,396
In a black suitcase, one of you
will carry a million dollars...

1356
02:16:18,701 --> 02:16:23,934
and come to the tower at Niagara Falls
at 5:00 p.m. Tomorrow

1357
02:16:24,373 --> 02:16:28,332
What happens then?
- You'll get to know once you're there

1358
02:17:23,399 --> 02:17:25,867
Now tell me...
where is Deepa?

1359
02:17:27,770 --> 02:17:29,567
Speak! Where is Deepa?

1360
02:17:30,873 --> 02:17:33,000
Stop it

1361
02:17:33,742 --> 02:17:36,506
He has fainted. We had better
hand him over to the police

1362
02:17:37,213 --> 02:17:40,842
Damodar, book a seat for me
on the flight to Canada

1363
02:17:41,283 --> 02:17:43,012
You won't be able to
handle those thugs

1364
02:17:43,385 --> 02:17:45,819
This isn't something for you.
Let me go instead

1365
02:17:46,188 --> 02:17:48,713
Let you go? How's that possible?

1366
02:17:49,291 --> 02:17:51,282
It has to do with my daughter's life

1367
02:17:55,197 --> 02:17:57,222
And your daughter
means the life to me

1368
02:19:08,637 --> 02:19:11,265
Look, isn't she your duplicate?

1369
02:19:11,807 --> 02:19:13,069
Absolutely

1370
02:19:13,409 --> 02:19:16,810
Seems as if I were looking at
my reflection in the mirror

1371
02:19:18,447 --> 02:19:20,972
I must leave now.
Jaggu will be calling any moment

1372
02:19:36,799 --> 02:19:38,426
Don't cry, Deepa

1373
02:19:42,037 --> 02:19:44,904
Who are you?
- Your twin sister

1374
02:19:45,441 --> 02:19:48,069
But I didn't have any sisters.
- You don't know

1375
02:19:48,444 --> 02:19:51,504
I didn't know it either.
It was your father who told me

1376
02:19:51,814 --> 02:19:54,374
Daddy? Where?
- In Paris

1377
02:19:55,084 --> 02:19:57,018
It was the first time
I was meeting my father

1378
02:19:57,886 --> 02:20:00,480
But he refused to accept me
as his daughter

1379
02:20:00,956 --> 02:20:02,321
Why?

1380
02:20:03,625 --> 02:20:08,221
Because I'm as rotten
as nice you are

1381
02:20:09,431 --> 02:20:10,989
Between you and me...

1382
02:20:11,567 --> 02:20:14,092
is the difference that
sets apart darkness and light

1383
02:20:16,205 --> 02:20:18,070
Sam was right

1384
02:20:18,540 --> 02:20:19,802
Do you know Sam?

1385
02:20:21,877 --> 02:20:25,142
I got to know him. Briefly

1386
02:20:26,181 --> 02:20:28,274
Never mind all that

1387
02:20:28,751 --> 02:20:30,912
Quickly wear my clothes
and get out of here

1388
02:20:31,387 --> 02:20:34,288
And you?
- Don't worry about me

1389
02:20:34,623 --> 02:20:35,851
Your life is in danger!

1390
02:20:36,759 --> 02:20:39,227
Must I endanger my sister's life
to save my own skin?

1391
02:20:39,661 --> 02:20:41,720
No, I can never do that

1392
02:20:42,197 --> 02:20:45,655
Go away, Deepa. Let's not argue.
- No, I'm not going!

1393
02:20:46,135 --> 02:20:50,902
Please, Deepa...
don't waste your love on me

1394
02:20:51,507 --> 02:20:52,838
I don't deserve it

1395
02:20:54,143 --> 02:20:58,341
I work for these gangsters.
- What?

1396
02:21:02,317 --> 02:21:05,343
Henceforth, you must hate me too

1397
02:21:06,789 --> 02:21:10,122
But before you go,
please embrace me, Deepa

1398
02:21:11,360 --> 02:21:13,760
Maybe I'll never have
the opportunity again

1399
02:21:17,366 --> 02:21:18,390
Come

1400
02:21:20,702 --> 02:21:24,468
My sister!

1401
02:21:24,907 --> 02:21:28,536
When you meet Shyam,
do tell him on my behalf...

1402
02:21:29,445 --> 02:21:34,542
one lives in darkness because
there's no one to show him light

1403
02:22:50,626 --> 02:22:52,924
Shekhar! You?

1404
02:22:53,795 --> 02:22:58,732
I've been sent by Deepa's father.
With a million dollars

1405
02:22:59,468 --> 02:23:01,698
You?
- Yes

1406
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:03,895
To take Deepa back

1407
02:23:06,808 --> 02:23:10,835
Deepa's father trusts
a fraud like you?

1408
02:23:11,747 --> 02:23:13,908
He has agreed to accept me
as his son-in-law

1409
02:23:17,486 --> 02:23:19,681
So you've cast a spell
on her father too!

1410
02:23:20,989 --> 02:23:24,015
Jack, you always took me
for a fool

1411
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:27,923
You always threatened me
and pushed me around

1412
02:23:29,264 --> 02:23:33,394
And now you're a smart man?
- Yes

1413
02:23:34,336 --> 02:23:36,702
Okay, smartie.
Set the bag there

1414
02:23:39,508 --> 02:23:42,068
Give it to me.
- First call Deepa

1415
02:23:44,546 --> 02:23:49,540
I can take it away by force.
- You won't, because this is a deal

1416
02:23:50,018 --> 02:23:51,849
You want money.
And I want Deepa

1417
02:23:53,922 --> 02:23:58,916
You've indeed smartened up.
I'm beginning to get scared of you

1418
02:24:10,472 --> 02:24:12,133
Did you see that?
- Yes, Jack

1419
02:24:12,441 --> 02:24:14,341
She's just like me!
- Isn't she!

1420
02:24:15,277 --> 02:24:17,336
Shekhar, you've met Suzy?

1421
02:24:20,782 --> 02:24:23,945
I'll take a walk outside,
while you chat

1422
02:24:28,790 --> 02:24:32,226
Jack, please ask someone
to see me out, will you?

1423
02:25:16,538 --> 02:25:19,632
Keep an eye on him.
And just wait there

1424
02:25:23,945 --> 02:25:26,937
Who's the other man?
- Other man? Who's that?

1425
02:25:27,616 --> 02:25:31,484
He's carrying a black suitcase
and is waiting near the tower

1426
02:25:32,954 --> 02:25:34,444
Could be someone.
How'd I know?

1427
02:25:37,559 --> 02:25:40,050
Hand it over to me.
- Don't you trust me?

1428
02:25:40,595 --> 02:25:42,927
We don't even trust our fathers
in this business

1429
02:25:43,598 --> 02:25:44,826
Not yourself either

1430
02:26:05,954 --> 02:26:06,716
Hurry up!

1431
02:26:42,324 --> 02:26:43,552
Is that man still there?

1432
02:26:44,659 --> 02:26:47,025
Send him into the tunnel
immediately

1433
02:27:15,223 --> 02:27:17,919
Don't you dare make any noise.
Just come with me

1434
02:29:22,317 --> 02:29:25,081
Your old flame. Sam

1435
02:29:26,821 --> 02:29:29,119
He has always put
obstacles in my path

1436
02:29:29,624 --> 02:29:31,421
Today, I have him where I want him

1437
02:29:32,394 --> 02:29:34,191
Sam, go away!

1438
02:29:36,264 --> 02:29:40,132
I'm not Deepa! I'm Suzy!
Believe me!

1439
02:29:40,435 --> 02:29:41,925
I've helped Deepa escape!

1440
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:46,266
She's waiting for you in Jack's boat.
Go away, Sam! Just escape!

1441
02:31:03,018 --> 02:31:05,213
What happened?
- Suzy's hurt, Makhan Singh!

1442
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:07,754
Shekhar shot at her and escaped.
I'm going after him...

1443
02:31:08,056 --> 02:31:10,752
and she's lying unconscious there.
- I'll go and get the police

1444
02:31:10,992 --> 02:31:11,651
Hurry up!

1445
02:39:24,118 --> 02:39:26,712
"From the skies I descend..."

1446
02:39:27,054 --> 02:39:29,818
"to give you lessons in love"

1447
02:39:30,191 --> 02:39:36,096
"In my heart is my beloved's picture,
I come to show it to you"

1448
02:39:36,330 --> 02:39:37,695
"Say you love me"

1449
02:39:38,032 --> 02:39:38,999
"Oh yes"

1450
02:39:39,333 --> 02:39:40,994
"Say you love me, my love"

1451
02:39:41,202 --> 02:39:42,294
"Oh yes"

1452
02:39:42,537 --> 02:39:44,266
"Say you love me, my love"

1453
02:39:44,539 --> 02:39:45,506
"I've said so"
