1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,278
With a girl in the house
atmosphere was very pleasant

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,274
But what to do?

3
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:07,945
Rosy child do you know train
leaves at 7.30

4
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:09,442
Have you packed your
things?

5
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:12,279
What's this, your clothes are still
hanging here?

6
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,613
You know very well mother that
Rosy will not go anywhere

7
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:15,846
Be sensible Raju

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,614
She should go back
to her house

9
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:20,385
She has no house, no support, she
has to stay here only

10
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,459
If she stays here then I'll
have to go from here

11
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:26,122
So long as I am alive my house
belongs to my sister

12
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,130
I'll not allow you to go

13
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:29,132
First go & push her in
the train

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,667
Then only your mother will
stay here

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:34,736
Do you think she will stay with a dancer
- I'm talking to my mother

16
00:00:34,943 --> 00:00:36,137
Will you keep quiet

17
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:37,678
Whom are you talking to
you idiot

18
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:41,147
Are you throwing her out of the
house or not?

19
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:42,148
No

20
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,816
Alright, sister pack your things
bus leaves at 5

21
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:48,486
Mother you are going!

22
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:53,885
Shameless girl, she
won't move at all, Oh God...

23
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:57,661
Please don't go mother, I fall
at your feet

24
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:01,824
Mother! I am a short while you'll
call me uncle

25
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,165
Your mother need not go
from here

26
00:01:04,372 --> 00:01:05,999
If I like I can turn you
out from here

27
00:01:06,207 --> 00:01:08,437
Your father wasn't
a fool

28
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,372
Half of the property he has given
to my sister

29
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,676
Mother if you go then...

30
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,344
I warn you won't see my face for
the whole life

31
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,532
Mother, I am hungry
give me food

32
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,385
I cried and dissuaded
her from going

33
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:00,219
Mother has gone?

34
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:04,060
She couldn't defy uncle

35
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:06,900
You allowed her to go

36
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:24,076
No Rosy, I got angry not with you
but with me

37
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:27,982
I swear by you Raju I caught
mother's feet

38
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,928
But uncle pulled my hair and
pushed me away

39
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,593
I wasn't able to stop it

40
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:40,265
And after that I behaved with you
so shabbily

41
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,936
This you should have done
earlier Raju

42
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:48,932
I seperated a son from his
mother, I should kill myself

43
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:54,611
Mad girl, mother has gone only
to uncle's place...

44
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,785
She'll cool down in a few days
& come back

45
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,952
Raju you throw that woman out
of your house

46
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,953
For that woman entire town has
turned hostile towards you

47
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:11,492
She has no honour & respect

48
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,462
The one who has left her husband
how can she be faithful...

49
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,295
One more word & it'll be the
end of friendship

50
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:18,165
Let the friendship
go to hell

51
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:21,136
Which creates a rift between friends
for a bad woman

52
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,490
Get up... Get up...

53
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,347
Why don't you throw me out
Raju, it'll be the end of miseries

54
00:04:11,993 --> 00:04:14,018
Who all will you fight with
for my sake?

55
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:16,093
Who else is there for me
except you?

56
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,531
I had already decided about this...

57
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm a social worker, wedded to
the old culture-

58
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:59,229
I want the old traditions
to blossom again

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,401
And its your responsibility
because you are the teachers...

60
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:09,241
Because the future generation is
dependent on you

61
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,247
You've to mould their
character

62
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:19,252
Should they go for Pop & Jazz
or classical music

63
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,927
You've to decide about it

64
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:28,929
I came to remind you that the
annual function is to be held

65
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:37,601
And fortunately the famous classical
dancer Ms. Nalini is in town

66
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,610
Ms. Nalini?

67
00:05:48,155 --> 00:05:49,622
Please keep on sitting

68
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,626
Ms. Nalini they're my friends

69
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,626
A variety show is going to be
held in their school

70
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:59,800
And they want to know whether you...

71
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,963
Fancy dress, dancing, singing, skit...

72
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:07,474
And I've to dance in that?

73
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:08,471
No No! It means that...

74
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:13,306
All these items will be over by
interval & after that your...

75
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:15,311
Yes yes yes...

76
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,310
These gentleman want to know
what item you will give...

77
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,320
You want me to dance now
- No no you're mistaken

78
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:27,983
Your item will be excellent, but
the programme has to be printed

79
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:32,154
And something has to be mentioned
- yes yes

80
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:36,503
But no audience, no music

81
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,669
If all of you insist then...

82
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,873
Why all this trouble?

83
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,575
One minute Raju

84
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:17,747
The one who has charmed this
worshipper of art by her dance

85
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:21,751
Where does that Mr. Nalini live?

86
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,257
He is an ordinary Guide Raju
who serves people

87
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:31,761
People who want to learn while
going on excursion

88
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:37,760
The objects that they see I decribe
them in an enchanting way

89
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:41,600
I may be mixing lies with the
truth but it can't be helped

90
00:16:41,808 --> 00:16:44,777
Because this world is
fully adulterated

91
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,607
And the more a man is adulterated
the more he is appreciated

92
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:56,954
I want to show my talent
Ms. Nalini if she'll come with me

93
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:02,284
I am sorry Ms. Nalini is tired &
she is taking rest

94
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:04,293
You come some other day

95
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,466
Who are you?

96
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,461
I am Rosy, attendent of Ms. Nalini

97
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:11,633
But you wanted her only
isn't it?

98
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:12,463
What did you say?

99
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:13,640
These are the days of
adultration

100
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,800
Nalini is adulterated with Rosy
Rosy will be fine with me

101
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:19,307
Fine!

102
00:17:19,513 --> 00:17:22,141
I show the people the world
through my eyes

103
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,976
Create history in ruins

104
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:27,642
I draw a picture with my words
show all the past

105
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,649
I show the future also
sometimes

106
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:35,657
See what there is infront

107
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,157
You might say its an old
lonely uninhabited house

108
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:40,500
Will it be a lie?

109
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,664
Ms. Rosy see further

110
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:44,830
Not beyond the landscape but
beyond the time

111
00:17:45,372 --> 00:17:48,500
8 Months have passed Nalini is
written on the name plate

112
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,336
A blooming garden
is there

113
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,512
And the shining car belongs
to Ms. Nalini

114
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,011
You want to know what is
that crowd

115
00:17:56,216 --> 00:18:00,175
Those mad people are waiting since
morning to have a glimpse of Ms. Nalini

116
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,519
And that man, didn't you
recognise him?

117
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,358
He is her Manager, all
in all Raju

118
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:11,026
See how impressively he walks

119
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:12,198
How reverendly people greet him

120
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:15,194
What he professed he has proved
he made Rosy & Ms. Nalini

121
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:17,700
People thought he boasts but
now they worship him

122
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:20,869
Raju, is it true?
- 100%

123
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:25,374
Can I know, who is interested
to know?

124
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:30,049
Every mirror has a picture

125
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,885
There is one mirror in
my heart also

126
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:36,215
Which hides this charming face
all the time

127
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:37,390
Really?
- Yes

128
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:38,216
Go ahead

129
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,557
Will you marry me?

130
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:49,735
You've got the divorce
from Marco

131
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,399
Atleast some one has found me
worthy of him

132
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,238
I can give my life for you

133
00:18:57,277 --> 00:19:01,407
Shall I take It as acceptance
- yes yes

134
00:19:01,948 --> 00:19:06,749
To become your wife, I will leave
my dance & job

135
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:09,081
Gladly

136
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:12,258
Our joint efforts are there
in your work!

137
00:19:13,126 --> 00:19:14,753
The situation to quit this
will never come!

138
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,927
If we have children then?

139
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:22,935
There isn't any guarantee that we'll
have children after marriage

140
00:19:26,807 --> 00:19:29,275
Is it a necessity that our
marriage take place now itself!

141
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:32,604
...But putting off long is
also not tolerable for me

142
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:15,860
There, what you see in Lake palace
Jag Temple... City palace

143
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:23,224
And that yellow Bungalow
on the hillock!

144
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,900
Belongs to the famous
dancer Ms. Nalini

145
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:30,739
10 shows in Delhi 10 shows
in Bombay,10 in Calcutta

146
00:24:30,944 --> 00:24:33,913
30 days,10 days for travelling, etc
...totally 40 days! But...

147
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:09,274
Rosy tell me truthfully
why are you not happy?

148
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,617
You've become what you
had dreamed!

149
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:13,445
You're doing what you've
always wanted to do!

150
00:25:14,654 --> 00:25:15,780
I never thought...

151
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:16,784
What?

152
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,291
I fear that my life will
become like yoked ox!

153
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,959
Blind folded, I'll be going round
round... round at the same place!

154
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:27,622
Tell me if you get tired, I'll not
accept new programmes!

155
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:52,824
Rosy, today you were wonderful

156
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,337
Feeling very happy to see you

157
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:14,672
Is Rosy here?

158
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:18,013
What are you doing here?

159
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:23,845
Last time when you met me
you talked to me respectfully

160
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:25,854
Last time when we met, you
considered dancing as

161
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:28,186
...A proffession of a woman
of a Harlem

162
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:30,024
...You!

163
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:33,357
Yes Raju!

164
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:35,193
I want to meet Rosy!

165
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:36,527
Rosy doesn't want to meet you!

166
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:37,699
Did you ask her?

167
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:42,708
Not necessary

168
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,703
Look Raju, I want to
meet her once!

169
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:48,710
I am behaving respectfully
with you!

170
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:49,882
So, leave this place
with respect!

171
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,048
If you try to enter
inside forcibly

172
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:58,054
Then, I too will be forced
to throw you out forcibly!

173
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:11,729
Do you know how much money
I made in this tour?

174
00:27:12,105 --> 00:27:13,072
Rs 40,000!!!

175
00:27:14,774 --> 00:27:16,401
Do I have a share in it?

176
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,237
Are we two separate?

177
00:27:23,449 --> 00:27:25,747
Why don't you feel happy
seeing the cheque?

178
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,585
I can get happiness even
in a flower!

179
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,084
If not, even if I get the entire
world, I'll not be happy

180
00:27:34,627 --> 00:27:38,256
Raju, I was never avaricious for money
even at Marco's house!

181
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:44,265
How did you get to
remember Marco today?

182
00:27:44,804 --> 00:27:45,600
He's Mr Khanna!

183
00:27:45,972 --> 00:27:48,270
He's Dinanath propritor
of Rajasthan Textile Mills!

184
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:49,771
He's Dhawan our chief of police!

185
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:52,270
Mr. Rudra, Lender of City Bank

186
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,107
...Mr. Sinha, who's going to contest
the next election!

187
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:58,614
...And Mr. Khanna is the
Editor of Truth of Voice!

188
00:27:58,818 --> 00:28:01,446
Sir, Your article on Nalini
was very good!

189
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:02,780
But the photograph wasn't
very good!

190
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:04,115
May be he didn't photograph it!

191
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:06,788
Hey Mr. Raju where is Nalini?

192
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,788
...Please, you must definitely
hear Mr. Varma's new poetry

193
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:12,794
It's very noisy here...
please you come this side

194
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:13,624
You come this side!

195
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:15,459
Come on Mr. Varma

196
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:17,966
Yes please! It's a request!

197
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:20,135
She's going away...
...she's gone!

198
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:23,305
Till which time these people are
going to stick around you!

199
00:28:24,177 --> 00:28:24,472
Why?

200
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:27,142
From morning they're stuck here
do you know its 12'o' clock!

201
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,474
I've called friends for lunch!

202
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:30,979
And you've not yet taken
bath and dressed

203
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,148
Raju, they're your friends
you be with them!

204
00:28:33,353 --> 00:28:34,479
Let me be with my associates

205
00:28:34,687 --> 00:28:35,813
Are you calling them as
your Associates?

206
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:38,319
Half-naked, half-hungry
road side Romeos!

207
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:39,320
They all look like beggars!

208
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:40,822
You only see their cloths!

209
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:42,490
They're not like your friends who can't
talk without a sip of liquor

210
00:28:43,196 --> 00:28:44,493
They're exceptional artistes!

211
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:47,993
And who giggle loudly
on useless talks!

212
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:49,000
I hate in make belief!

213
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,328
My stake's 50!

214
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:51,503
Mine also a 50!

215
00:28:52,038 --> 00:28:53,335
100! 100?!

216
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:55,670
No... I am dropping out!

217
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,169
My stake is Rs 200!

218
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:01,005
Mine also Rs 200!

219
00:29:02,215 --> 00:29:05,343
And mine... is Rs 500!

220
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:10,014
Another Rs 500 from my side!

221
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:12,691
Okay! I quit!

222
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,698
It's show in Rs 1000!

223
00:29:24,904 --> 00:29:25,700
Come on show! I'll give it!

224
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:27,372
Look Raju, we'll lose the
excitement of the game!

225
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,377
Okay! Lend me a 1000! I'll get
it from upstairs

226
00:29:31,577 --> 00:29:32,544
No credit for gambling, please!

227
00:29:32,745 --> 00:29:34,042
By the way you can take even
a lakh out side!

228
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,208
Come on, get it from the locker
what's so urgency in it?

229
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,058
Every second day you come to
get the cheques signed

230
00:29:46,592 --> 00:29:48,219
Why don't you keep money in
your account also?

231
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:49,554
Fearing creditors!

232
00:29:52,598 --> 00:29:53,223
Rs 2000?!

233
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:55,734
Only day before yesterday you
had drawn Rs 2000?

234
00:29:55,935 --> 00:29:58,062
Rosy, big people's expenses are
also very big!

235
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,398
To maintain you prestige
it'll lost dearly!

236
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,908
Let it be... my prestige?

237
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:08,072
Take this... return back
Rs 1000 and show!

238
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:12,918
It's run!

239
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:17,081
Please take it!

240
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:29,761
What are you doing in
my room at this time?

241
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:32,938
Are you still awake?

242
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:35,774
No... I am talking
in my sleep!

243
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:44,112
Now a days you do remember only
when you're drunk, isn't it?

244
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:47,612
I drink remembering you and I
remember you when I am drunk

245
00:30:48,488 --> 00:30:49,955
Okay, now you go to your
room and sleep!

246
00:30:53,826 --> 00:30:55,794
You're always telling to go
away now a days!

247
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:57,959
Have you forgotten to say
come?

248
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:00,958
Move away!

249
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,226
Lay like that only

250
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:05,832
No, Raju now I don't like
all this!

251
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:10,138
Don't you like me anymore?

252
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:11,802
I don't like anything!

253
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:13,975
Because I consume liquor!

254
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:15,476
No!

255
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:17,816
I gamble...
- no!

256
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:22,320
Then, why Rosy?
- Enough!

257
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:27,147
There'll be a matter!
Then it's all over!

258
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:28,653
You mean, Love?!?

259
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:30,992
What's the meaning of Love?

260
00:31:32,532 --> 00:31:33,999
Expectation, is thy name of Love?

261
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:39,168
When there's love with expectation
there won't be any meaning of Love!

262
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:43,001
There's always adulteration
in Love!

263
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,678
Just as you had an intention
about while seeking Love!

264
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:51,012
Now, do you love me with
any other intention?

265
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:54,345
If I tell something rash, you'll
tell that I am drunk!

266
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:57,188
Tell it, making drunkenness
as a reason!

267
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,857
I am thinking that Marco
might have been correct!

268
00:32:02,395 --> 00:32:03,521
Marco was right!

269
00:32:04,063 --> 00:32:06,861
He was right when he said that man shouldn't
live on a woman's earnings

270
00:32:07,233 --> 00:32:09,360
Then, you've mistaken that
I am living of your earnings!

271
00:32:09,902 --> 00:32:13,531
And you've forgotten that, it's me as
ladder, you has reached the top!

272
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:16,875
Have you forgotten that every pie
you earn is result of my hard work

273
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:17,872
Can you deny it?

274
00:32:18,244 --> 00:32:18,710
Even before

275
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:22,043
I was rich all by myself!

276
00:32:22,582 --> 00:32:22,877
We'll work after the show!

277
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:26,707
Yes Raju! When did I refuse it?

278
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:11,089
Sir, A parcel in the name
of Mrs. Rosy Marco!

279
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:36,277
I am greatful for Udaipur's Guide Raju
for helping & taking me to the caves

280
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:45,456
But, do you know Raju why no one
had ever reached upto this place!

281
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,799
Because, lt was in my fate
to do this job!

282
00:33:48,334 --> 00:33:50,302
I was here searching it!

283
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:51,970
I was here only to know
the price of it!

284
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:55,629
I was here to get this place
a fame which it deserves!

285
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,472
But Raju, don't worry

286
00:33:57,843 --> 00:33:59,470
your name will be definitely
mentioned in the book!

287
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,313
Because, it was you who had
brought me upto this place!

288
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:10,151
The matter is that...

289
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:13,321
This was sent to us from our
Bank's Delhi Head Branch

290
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,488
There in a joint account
of Mr & Mrs Marco!

291
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:20,832
...Some Rs 20-25 thousand worth
jewellary is there in the locker!

292
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,335
Because Mr. Marco wants to
close the Bank account!

293
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:25,003
...lt's obvious that you've
to take away the jewellary too!

294
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:28,340
And for this, they both have
to sign this application!

295
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:30,501
After being signed by
Mrs. Marco

296
00:34:30,977 --> 00:34:33,002
...This will be sent to Mr. Marco for
his signature!

297
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:34,204
Yes... yes!

298
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:37,175
So Mr. Marco wants to steal
Ms. Nalini's jewels!

299
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,849
Mr. Marco wishes the jewellary
be given to Ms. Nalini

300
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,186
Then, he wants to show off
how large hearted he is?

301
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:48,790
Look sir, Ms. Nalini absolutely doesn't
want Mr. Marco's jewellary?

302
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:49,959
She will not even spit on it?

303
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,689
You can tell this with Mr. Marco!

304
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,861
Neither, you allow we to meet Mrs. Marco
not try to understand my words!

305
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,965
What do we have to do with
the fighting of a wife & husband?

306
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,032
The Bank wants the jewellary
be taken out!

307
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,206
After that throw it into drain
how does it concern us?

308
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:02,700
Get out Raju, otherwise
I've to walk out!

309
00:35:02,908 --> 00:35:04,705
Then, please tell, will you
get this signed or...

310
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,877
Shall I send it by
registered post?

311
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:19,554
Get your balance Raju!
Get your balance

312
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:22,386
Marco is doing this cleverly

313
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:25,560
First, he sent book...
now... jewellary!

314
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:29,393
May be he's planning to win
back Rosy's heart!

315
00:35:30,936 --> 00:35:32,733
It's better, if this matter
never reaches Rosy!

316
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:06,869
Hey look at this photos!

317
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:08,438
Yuch, they may be of some
priest!

318
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,776
Do you know what's
the time now?

319
00:36:13,979 --> 00:36:14,274
What?

320
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,775
It's 11.30 PM

321
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:18,947
Oh! My God! I should've gone
home by 11 PM

322
00:36:19,151 --> 00:36:19,776
...I am going off!

323
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:24,615
...Okay go and take rest!

324
00:36:40,272 --> 00:36:42,297
Now a days you don't have any
time left for me!

325
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:44,468
I want to ask you something

326
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:46,978
...Let's talk tomorrow!

327
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:58,546
Thought that, why not ask now, what I
wanted to ask tomorrow

328
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:00,916
Where have you kept the
Marco's book?

329
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,327
This Fella Mani, will definitely
lose his job!

330
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:09,897
But, sir... l...

331
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:13,835
If you utter even a word more
I'll kick you out!

332
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:14,834
Are you my employee
or some one else?

333
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:17,341
Behind me, you go to
complain against me!

334
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,668
And... moreover try to
explain it!

335
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:21,541
...Don't do it like this
in future

336
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:31,022
Can't this distance between
us be closed?

337
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:33,682
Try it!

338
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:35,417
I've come to try, don't you
want to help me?

339
00:37:38,898 --> 00:37:40,297
Raju, I don't have any
complaint against you!

340
00:37:43,402 --> 00:37:44,994
My complaint is that you don't
have any complaint against me!

341
00:37:45,738 --> 00:37:47,603
I wish that, you cry, shout
and abuse me!

342
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,704
...And even slap me also!

343
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:52,435
But do something by which I can
know that you've concern on me!

344
00:37:54,413 --> 00:37:56,278
You had shown this much
of mercy, even on Marco!

345
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:02,212
A sort of a fort has formed on
all the 4 sides of the heart!

346
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,085
No gesture is able to reach
there now!

347
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,058
Neither happy... nor sad!

348
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:12,224
Raju, you're absoultely free
from my side!

349
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:14,221
Infact I am happy...

350
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,735
That you've learnt the
technic of acquiring happiness!

351
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:19,263
Don't throw me away Rosy
don't throw me away

352
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:21,739
Please Raju, I am very tired!

353
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:24,409
Sleep in my arms, resting
your head on my shoulder!

354
00:38:25,277 --> 00:38:28,247
There was once a time, when you
used to get rejuvenated by that!

355
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:29,236
What are you doing?
Leave me!

356
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:32,683
This isn't anything new, me
holding your hands like this!

357
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:35,580
Suddenly, why is this
alieness?

358
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:36,311
Rosy, why is this hatred?

359
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:37,419
Where has the love gone
away for me?

360
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:38,647
What was my crime?

361
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,086
If you say, I'll quit drinking
gambling, all my friends!

362
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:47,094
...Even this world but for once
you become my old Rosy!

363
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:51,633
Please, for once tell me that
you love me, you love only me!

364
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:53,529
After that, I'll never be
a trouble to you!

365
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:54,865
...And I'll never come to you!

366
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:54,995
Oh! Mani! Come... come!

367
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:58,101
You said, we'll work
after the show!

368
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,830
Bring a glass from there
for yourself

369
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:04,007
No sir, after doing this
work I'll go!

370
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:05,769
Hey! Man! Get it!

371
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:09,281
Don't you also want to sit
with me & have a small talk?

372
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,577
You're making me feel shy!

373
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:16,177
Sir, What's the matter, today
you're drinking alone?

374
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:22,320
I was longing to talk so, I
thought I'll have a few pegs

375
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,853
...And say few words
to myself!

376
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:34,134
...I have become little
irritated!

377
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:38,533
If I say something bad in anger
don't take it seriously!

378
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:41,342
Do I've that capacity sir?

379
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,873
Life is also like a
intoxication! Friend!

380
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,717
When it gets you, don't
ask what'll be the condition?

381
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:53,724
...But when it gets down...

382
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:47,449
What's this fun?

383
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:49,181
It may have been good
if it was for fun?

384
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:51,682
Neither the castles would've
been built, nor destroyed!

385
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:54,188
Neither our paths could've
joined nor get split!

386
00:45:56,094 --> 00:45:57,857
The funny thing about this is
this isn't fun!

387
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:02,131
Is all this drama neccessary?

388
00:46:03,235 --> 00:46:05,203
One who has himself become drama
what drama will he play?

389
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:07,465
Come madam, I'll see you
up to the Car!

390
00:46:11,543 --> 00:46:13,704
Alright, now you go and
change your dress!

391
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,135
...l'll be waiting for you!

392
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:17,438
I've waited for someone
very long!

393
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,984
On a path, which was never
in your journey!

394
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,218
What happened to all
of a sudden?

395
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,823
Look! It's show time!

396
00:46:28,093 --> 00:46:30,391
The time is over!
The show is over!

397
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:34,523
I've seen it!

398
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:37,360
I think today you don't have the
intention of coming with me

399
00:46:37,936 --> 00:46:40,564
My intention was right, but the
companion couldn't keep up with me

400
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:45,474
Raju, I've understood what
you want to tell me!

401
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:50,081
But, before hurting me
ask your heart

402
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:53,244
...Whether the whole
crime was mine?

403
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:56,086
Let God forbid anyone
hurting your heart

404
00:46:58,957 --> 00:47:00,083
...Take madam to the theatre!

405
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:03,426
Has Boss come?

406
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:04,424
No madam, not yet!

407
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,003
For whom are you waiting here?
Everyone has left!

408
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,375
Any whereabouts of him?

409
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:22,939
No, not yet!

410
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:27,947
Mother! Your Raju has
come back!

411
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:31,088
Without you, this home isn't
like a home!

412
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,890
All the night I am lying
but I don't get sleep!

413
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:39,490
Neither there's anyone to feed me nor
to tell story and put me to sleep!

414
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:44,632
Tell uncle to forgive me!

415
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,695
Anyhow, the blood is of our
clan isn't it?

416
00:47:48,507 --> 00:47:51,806
Didn't I tell you that one day
he'll change & come back!

417
00:47:52,177 --> 00:47:54,145
...Come on sister, pack your bags
we will go to the city!

418
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:07,916
You sit there!

419
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,986
I thought that not only from
Nalini's house

420
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,260
...you might've run away
from the city itself!

421
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:14,161
What made you come here
my friend?

422
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,325
Not friendship! But today my
duty has brought me here!

423
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:20,334
Come... please come in!

424
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,132
You didn't do it rightly, Raju!

425
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:27,671
You could've done this to anyone
but you shouldn't have cheated Rosy

426
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,743
When, she had willingly given you
lakhs of her earnings to you!

427
00:48:32,217 --> 00:48:33,650
Why did you do this for a
paltry Rs 30,000 worth jewellary?

428
00:48:34,386 --> 00:48:36,217
For which, out of greed, you had
forged the signature!

429
00:48:39,057 --> 00:48:39,887
Who told you this?

430
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:41,020
Who told me this?

431
00:48:41,726 --> 00:48:42,693
...The whole city knows it

432
00:48:43,728 --> 00:48:44,353
...This is your warrant!

433
00:48:45,397 --> 00:48:47,695
...The sad job of arresting was
given to me

434
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:51,960
...For the crime of forgery...

435
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:56,369
What is the evidence that this
signature is mine not Nalini!

436
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:59,203
Do you think even after this
Nalini will lie for you?

437
00:49:00,278 --> 00:49:01,870
When she came to know about it
she started crying

438
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:04,374
...She said that she never expected
something like this from Raju!

439
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,720
Where do I've to come?

440
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:15,052
For now to the lock-up!

441
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,387
...Till the judgement is
passed on the case!

442
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,387
Right now!

443
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,801
Won't you give me a chance
to meet Rosy?

444
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:27,731
Why not? When our friendship is
going to come to the help?

445
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:31,234
But, Raju as far as
I know

446
00:49:31,443 --> 00:49:33,240
...She'll hate to see
even your face!

447
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,405
But still...

448
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,509
...l'll see her!

449
00:49:39,618 --> 00:49:40,243
As you wish!

450
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:44,546
Ms. Nalini it's time!

451
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:45,589
I am coming

452
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:03,434
Madam, the curtains are up!

453
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:46,065
Where did you got lost
in thoughts?

454
00:57:48,773 --> 00:57:50,070
Come on! Atleast now the
show is also over!

455
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:55,634
Have you talked to Rosy?

456
00:57:58,282 --> 00:57:58,646
Talked?

457
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,090
Raju, why did you
do like that?

458
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:14,594
If you were in need of money
you could've told me!

459
00:58:15,299 --> 00:58:17,699
...I would've sold my jewellary
I would've sold my property!

460
00:58:18,636 --> 00:58:19,728
But, why did you do
like that?

461
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:24,272
I thought, if not anyone
atleast you'll understand me

462
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:27,770
Look, how ignorant my
thoughts were also

463
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:30,970
Raju, the truth is that

464
00:58:31,783 --> 00:58:34,047
Neither you understood me
nor I understood you!

465
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:37,446
Offender Raju...

466
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,287
Under Indian Penal Code
Section 417...

467
00:58:42,994 --> 00:58:44,518
...You're being Sentenced with
2 years prison!

468
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:51,624
Raju, when you left me

469
00:58:53,337 --> 00:58:55,305
Only now I able to know
what you were to me?

470
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:56,498
...What you are?

471
00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:02,305
I am abusing myself always
for not lying to save you!

472
00:59:05,183 --> 00:59:06,411
Rosy! The crime was
definitely mine!

473
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:10,153
It would've been better if I
had made you as my wife!

474
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:13,320
But, I don't know, what was my compulsion
before I could make you my wife!

475
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:14,821
...I felt like making you
Queen of this world!

476
00:59:16,828 --> 00:59:18,989
You achieved fame and
I become proud

477
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:22,833
...When I regained my senses
I found myself in Jail!

478
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,603
2 Years will fly away! We'll
start a new life again!

479
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,403
Yes! I've to start
newly again

480
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:36,513
...Life!

481
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:49,824
...Only I know it!

482
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:53,497
I had only this hope that someday
Raju will be able to forgive me!

483
00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:00,127
Today, I don't have even
that hope also!

484
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,565
I don't know whose fault
was it!

485
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:06,072
...And I don't want to
know also!

486
01:00:08,179 --> 01:00:12,115
But, one thing's definite
I've lost my son!

487
01:00:14,085 --> 01:00:18,454
I don't know where he may be
in what condition?

488
01:00:27,064 --> 01:00:28,361
The Govt has accepted
your petition

489
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,426
Next month a post office
will be opened here!

490
01:00:32,136 --> 01:00:35,003
First school! Then Hospital...
and now post office!

491
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:38,073
My Lord, you've come and this village
has become a heaven!

492
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,999
Uncle, you said it right?

493
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:49,308
Go... school's over!

494
01:00:55,793 --> 01:00:58,261
Okay... Okay... children
first stop the noise!

495
01:00:58,462 --> 01:01:00,555
And tell me which story
do you want to hear?

496
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:07,601
Today, I'll narrate a story...

497
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:11,602
...Which my mother had narrated
many times in my childhood!

498
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:18,839
Once there was a
severe famine!

499
01:01:19,483 --> 01:01:20,575
The Earth cracked up!

500
01:01:21,385 --> 01:01:22,852
...There was not a drop of Rain!

501
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:27,621
...Even humans started dying in
utter starvation

502
01:01:28,092 --> 01:01:29,252
...Even God's got afraid!

503
01:01:29,493 --> 01:01:31,961
Is the God trying to eliminate
the mankind?

504
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,793
This is the story of
that great Sage

505
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:37,593
...Who had fasted continously
for 12 days

506
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,336
...And forced the God
to shower rain!

507
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,629
Lord! 12 days?

508
01:01:42,173 --> 01:01:42,935
Didn't ate anything?

509
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:45,300
Neither did he ate nor drank!

510
01:01:45,943 --> 01:01:46,739
Did it rain?

511
01:01:47,178 --> 01:01:47,906
It poured!

512
01:01:48,412 --> 01:01:49,379
It's a miracle of God!

513
01:01:50,448 --> 01:01:52,245
Lord! Can this happen?

514
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,246
Lmagine that your house got
fired & this boy is inside

515
01:01:58,956 --> 01:02:01,550
Won't you jump into the fire
to save the child?

516
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,320
You're just his mother!

517
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,028
They say that God for
his devotees!

518
01:02:08,232 --> 01:02:11,201
Is mother, father, relative
and also friend

519
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,367
Yeah! I was talking
about famine...

520
01:03:07,692 --> 01:03:08,522
Everything is over!

521
01:03:08,926 --> 01:03:09,654
He's lying!

522
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,384
He has piled up stocks
in his godown!

523
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,741
Greetings Lord! Your food!

524
01:03:34,418 --> 01:03:36,113
Hey! How are you here?
Where is Bhola?

525
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,048
Brother is on bed!

526
01:03:37,288 --> 01:03:37,754
Bed?!

527
01:03:37,955 --> 01:03:38,751
...Brother-hurt!

528
01:03:39,123 --> 01:03:39,589
Hurt?!

529
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,256
Beat on head by stick...
lot of blood!

530
01:03:41,726 --> 01:03:43,387
Is it? Where? How?

531
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:47,327
Brother! Stop... Riots
knifes, daggers & spears!

532
01:03:47,965 --> 01:03:49,489
How do you talk without
any connection?

533
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,162
Sit here and regain your breath
and tell in detail!

534
01:03:52,236 --> 01:03:53,464
Did the villagers fight?

535
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:53,966
Yes!

536
01:03:54,905 --> 01:03:55,929
Did they loot the shop?

537
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:56,504
They looted!

538
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,038
A lot of people got hurt, isn't it?

539
01:03:58,242 --> 01:03:59,641
Yes! They have... many more will
Tonight!

540
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,475
In this bad time, without helping
each other, why this bad blood?

541
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:05,471
Do humans live here
or Demons?

542
01:04:06,016 --> 01:04:06,675
Go and tell the villagers that...

543
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,181
...Even If one life is lost, I'll
secrifice my life

544
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:08,875
Sacrifice you life?

545
01:04:09,086 --> 01:04:11,054
If they don't stop rioting, then
I'll stop eating & drinking

546
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:11,949
Stop eating & drinking?!

547
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:13,652
Take back this food!

548
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:14,950
...And send those people
to me!

549
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,985
One side there's no rain
& other side these riots!

550
01:04:18,863 --> 01:04:21,730
No rain, I'll fast
sacrifice my life!

551
01:04:21,932 --> 01:04:25,231
I'll fast... sacrifice my life
I'll fast... sacrifice my life!

552
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:27,266
I'll fast... sacrifice my life
I'll fast... sacrifice my life!

553
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,636
Hey! What's your problem?

554
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:35,571
Saint?
- Yes!

555
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,505
Saint will fast?
Yes! -why?

556
01:04:37,848 --> 01:04:41,113
One there's no rain here... on that
...l'll fast sacrifice my life

557
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:42,410
Did saint say this with you?
- Yes, he told this with me!

558
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,245
Did he say that he'll fast
because there's no rain!

559
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,720
Will the saint fast for
bringing rain?

560
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:48,152
Fast?

561
01:04:48,959 --> 01:04:51,291
Don't you remember, that saint
used to narrate a story!

562
01:04:51,495 --> 01:04:51,790
Yes... yes!

563
01:04:51,996 --> 01:04:55,329
We have done gross injustice
towards a saintly man!

564
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,829
There he's ready to sacrifice
his life for us!

565
01:04:58,169 --> 01:05:00,364
...And here we are after
each other's life!

566
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,933
It's matter of great shame!

567
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:17,680
Saint... saint...
saint has arrived!

568
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:23,618
Saint! As soon as they heard
about you, the riots stopped

569
01:05:25,696 --> 01:05:26,924
What did you tell them?

570
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:28,629
What you had told me?

571
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:29,424
What did I say?

572
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,924
...That you'll sacrifice your life!

573
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,430
And...

574
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:32,567
...And you'll fast!

575
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:33,201
How many days?

576
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:33,870
For 12 days!

577
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:34,594
Did I say it?

578
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,898
It wasn't you or me, they
had thought like that!

579
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:39,075
...That saint will fast and
there'll be rain!

580
01:05:39,877 --> 01:05:41,469
This story is of that great saint

581
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:43,909
...Who had fasted continously
for 12 days!

582
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:47,374
...And forced God to rain!

583
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:49,977
Bhola, come with me!

584
01:05:52,723 --> 01:05:55,351
Bhola, what's all this
you've all mistaken!

585
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,493
I've never claimed that
I am a saint or messiah!

586
01:05:57,928 --> 01:06:00,294
Even If I am will it rain
if I fast? -why not?

587
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,898
Those are just tales! That
too children's tales!

588
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:06,465
You make these villagers understand
that I've just threatned to fast!

589
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:07,896
...Just to stop the riots!

590
01:06:08,272 --> 01:06:11,002
Now that it has been achieved
everyone go back to your house

591
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:13,640
My condition is very bad
with hunger... go!

592
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,542
Why are you staring at me?

593
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:21,017
Saint... saint...
show mercy on us!

594
01:06:21,785 --> 01:06:24,481
I accept... I accept that I've
committed a sin!

595
01:06:25,222 --> 01:06:27,417
But, you know how greed
makes us to do all bad things

596
01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:30,754
For the past 2 days there's no
food in my house!

597
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,592
The children are crying for
food in hunger!

598
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,596
My wife is having high fever

599
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:37,493
...And night... even my cow
also died!

600
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:40,937
Saint! Every home is in the
same condition!

601
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:43,568
Now, only your mercy can
save us!

602
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,268
You've gone crazy
what can I do?

603
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:49,309
Saint... saint...

604
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,605
Our cries, shrieks may never
reach him

605
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:54,878
...But God can never refuse
your prayers!

606
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:56,682
If you fast...

607
01:06:57,454 --> 01:06:59,649
...l'll guarantee that the whole
village will join you!

608
01:07:00,457 --> 01:07:04,018
It has already been decided that
some will fast for 2,some for 4 days

609
01:07:04,328 --> 01:07:06,159
...And few will skip
one meal every day!

610
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:12,295
Show mercy, Saint show mercy on us
otherwise we'll die

611
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:21,873
Not only for 12 days, I'll fast till
death, if it brings good for you

612
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:25,405
...But I am not the one whom
you're thinking me to be!

613
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,076
I am an ordinary Guide!

614
01:07:27,284 --> 01:07:30,219
...And I've been even to Jail also
for a girl!

615
01:07:30,688 --> 01:07:31,154
Yes Jail!

616
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:33,448
If you hear my story!

617
01:07:34,325 --> 01:07:37,453
You'll find that there's no
big difference between us!

618
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:39,751
I too have weaknesses!

619
01:07:39,964 --> 01:07:42,432
I too have troubled people
told lies! Cheated people

620
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,165
I've been cursed by my own
as well other people!

621
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,794
They're taking a lot of time!

622
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,830
Come... let's see! Come!

623
01:07:52,343 --> 01:07:55,608
Hiding my face & wandering for
a year, I took shelter in this temple

624
01:07:55,813 --> 01:07:57,178
You people thought I was
a saint

625
01:07:58,482 --> 01:08:00,382
It's true that I had
compassion for you!

626
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:03,679
...But that's all nothing
more than that!

627
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:08,049
May be now, you consider me as
a cheater & start hating me

628
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:11,117
But telling you the truth
was a neccessity for me!

629
01:08:32,816 --> 01:08:35,876
Saint! The path of knowledge
is very crooked!

630
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,218
...Valmiki became a sage
after being a dacoit!

631
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:44,624
Goswami Tulasidas cut through a desire
of a woman to became a sage!

632
01:08:45,596 --> 01:08:47,359
My confidence in you has
become even stronger!

633
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,156
After getting purified by
12 days of penance

634
01:08:51,135 --> 01:08:52,727
...The cry which comes
out of your soul!

635
01:08:53,537 --> 01:08:55,402
...That will tear open the skies!

636
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:00,909
...And Gods will be forced to cry & wet the
earth to quench the thirst!

637
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:44,787
Come on saint, where are
you going?

638
01:09:45,322 --> 01:09:48,018
Today is just 2nd day
of your fast!

639
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:01,132
Go... go... and search for
your benefactor!

640
01:10:14,518 --> 01:10:15,815
Priest
- yes!

641
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:17,083
...Come little aside!

642
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,121
Priest! Priest!

643
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,185
Danger! -then...

644
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:25,328
Slip away...

645
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:27,020
Slowly... slowly...

646
01:12:28,685 --> 01:12:30,118
We too were going there only!

647
01:12:30,988 --> 01:12:34,389
...But came to know that a great saint has
appered about 100 miles from here

648
01:12:34,858 --> 01:12:37,418
And for bringing rain he's
fasting!

649
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:39,295
...Thought that we'll go for
his glimpse!

650
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:40,854
You too come with us!

651
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,831
Move on move on
A lot of people are waiting!

652
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:47,295
Move on! Move on!

653
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:51,234
Sister don't disturb saint
bow from here only!

654
01:12:58,315 --> 01:13:01,807
Bhola, it will be greatful if
you ask the saint once...

655
01:13:02,386 --> 01:13:05,685
Look, why are you disturbing
saint for trivial matters!

656
01:13:06,657 --> 01:13:08,284
For the past 6 days he's been
fasting for us!

657
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:09,589
Didn't touch even a
drop of water!

658
01:13:10,227 --> 01:13:12,218
...Be patient!
Don't do it like that!

659
01:13:12,663 --> 01:13:15,223
Bhola, how many times I had told you
that no one should touch my feet!

660
01:13:15,499 --> 01:13:17,899
Oh! They don't heed even
after I warn them!

661
01:13:18,101 --> 01:13:18,499
Mother!

662
01:13:19,069 --> 01:13:20,502
Sister, I've already told
you once that...

663
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:25,367
Hey Raju, My son... Raju!

664
01:13:51,335 --> 01:13:56,398
Where every head bows in reverance
there even a stone becomes God

665
01:13:58,275 --> 01:14:00,835
The place which makes you
remember the God!

666
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:02,708
...That place is called "Aura"

667
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:07,374
On a glimpse of man, if it rakes
up devotion of God in you!

668
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:09,213
...He's called as Saint!

669
01:14:10,554 --> 01:14:14,320
...Because of you, this old temple
has become a Pilgrim centre!

670
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:19,625
...And thousands of eyes
are raising up!

671
01:14:20,864 --> 01:14:22,024
...Towards light!

672
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:26,228
Then, why are you worried?

673
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,868
Bow your head, sit peacefully!

674
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:33,108
Think that someone else is
there to do the job

675
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:34,705
...And you're just a medium!

676
01:14:36,446 --> 01:14:38,573
Work is done by him!
But the name is yours!

677
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:44,319
Chant his name! And continue
doing the entrusted work!

678
01:14:45,088 --> 01:14:45,611
Just like me!

679
01:14:47,724 --> 01:14:49,089
Just like a stone

680
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:01,432
Mother, I must be serving you

681
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:03,633
Go and sleep

682
01:16:12,976 --> 01:16:15,911
Saint! This lady has come
from America so meet you

683
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,445
...She has been sent here by a
big television company!

684
01:16:18,849 --> 01:16:20,510
She wants to ask you
a few questions!

685
01:16:20,717 --> 01:16:21,081
Permission granted?

686
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:30,286
Saint, do you believe
in fasting?

687
01:16:30,827 --> 01:16:38,757
If 40 Crores fast for one time
40 Crore can eat one meal

688
01:16:57,287 --> 01:16:59,551
Saint, do you believe that
it'll rain?

689
01:17:02,692 --> 01:17:04,660
These people have
confidence in me...

690
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:09,165
Now, I've begun to be confident about
these people's confidence

691
01:17:57,881 --> 01:18:01,612
This lady is asking whether
you had ever loved anyone?

692
01:18:04,988 --> 01:18:05,454
Water!

693
01:19:29,239 --> 01:19:31,400
Rosy has come back!
And mother too!

694
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:34,409
What if it doesn't rain?

695
01:19:34,978 --> 01:19:36,673
The life from which I got vexed
and ran away!

696
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,538
...ls now chasing me!

697
01:19:39,382 --> 01:19:40,440
...lt's calling me back!

698
01:19:41,017 --> 01:19:42,041
...Promising happiness!

699
01:19:43,019 --> 01:19:45,317
Thousands of people's wishes
will go down the drain!

700
01:19:45,522 --> 01:19:46,887
...Their confidences will
be shattered!

701
01:19:47,957 --> 01:19:48,889
What will they think of me?

702
01:19:49,693 --> 01:19:50,159
Cheater?!

703
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:51,886
Fraud?!

704
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,819
Are you sure that its
going to rain?

705
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:56,963
You too have started believing these
Supersitions like these illiterates!

706
01:19:57,801 --> 01:19:58,631
Raju, is it you?

707
01:19:59,102 --> 01:20:01,161
Haven't you also started
believing that...

708
01:20:01,404 --> 01:20:03,964
...There'll be a relationship
between a man's fast and clouds!

709
01:20:04,474 --> 01:20:07,409
I don't know it, Raju! I am
getting more & more confused

710
01:20:07,977 --> 01:20:11,242
I've started thinking those things
which I've never thought necessary

711
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:14,372
...But thinking about which is more
important than life & death

712
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:18,279
The question now, is not
if it rains or not!

713
01:20:19,122 --> 01:20:21,420
The question's not whether
I'll live or die!

714
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:25,390
The question is whether the Creator
and Protector of this World

715
01:20:25,595 --> 01:20:26,562
...ls someone like that
is there or not!

716
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:30,431
If he isn't there then no problem
whether its life or death

717
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:32,624
There's no excitement in living like
a blind man in a blind world

718
01:20:33,136 --> 01:20:33,659
And if he's there...

719
01:20:34,838 --> 01:20:38,934
Then, I want to see whether he'll listen
to his desperate people or not!

720
01:20:42,545 --> 01:20:44,809
Are you asleep?

721
01:20:52,188 --> 01:20:52,677
I was sleeping

722
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:56,316
...But now I've just started
awakening little

723
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,459
Didn't I tell you that you
can't come inside?

724
01:20:58,661 --> 01:21:00,754
But sir, listen me, you may
have mistaken me!

725
01:21:00,964 --> 01:21:05,799
This photograph resembles my
bosom friend! Look at it

726
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:10,271
For God sake, all I want to know that
one whom you call as Raju swami...

727
01:21:10,507 --> 01:21:12,475
Whether he's my bosom
friend Raju, that's all

728
01:21:12,675 --> 01:21:14,643
But you belong to other religion
you can't enter a temple!

729
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:31,756
My friend, I know it definitely
that it'll be you only!

730
01:21:33,196 --> 01:21:35,528
But Raju in what condition?

731
01:21:42,038 --> 01:21:42,436
Yes sir

732
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:43,469
What is my religion?

733
01:21:44,207 --> 01:21:44,605
Saint!

734
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:46,936
Love is my religion

735
01:21:48,311 --> 01:21:50,040
Friendship is my devotion

736
01:22:05,829 --> 01:22:10,630
Mother, did you hear that
Raju's life is in danger!

737
01:22:14,637 --> 01:22:15,433
Please do something

738
01:22:38,761 --> 01:22:39,557
Saint!

739
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:52,902
...My son!

740
01:23:09,893 --> 01:23:11,918
Saint! Saint!

741
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:41,247
God! These people consider
me as your son!

742
01:23:43,726 --> 01:23:47,787
And you're so far
away from me

743
01:23:51,434 --> 01:23:55,302
If not mine, atleast heed
these people's prayers!

744
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:09,176
...Take my life...

745
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:19,893
Take away their sorrows God
Take away their sorrows

746
01:24:20,363 --> 01:24:20,829
God, don't

747
01:24:27,003 --> 01:24:27,594
Oh God!

748
01:26:38,668 --> 01:26:41,535
My child! Don't be afraid
of sorrows

749
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:46,106
Sorrow is that nectar with which
sins are washed away!

750
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:49,369
I am not very far away
from you...

751
01:26:50,346 --> 01:26:53,406
I am inside you & outside of you!
I am omnipresent

752
01:26:54,117 --> 01:26:56,745
Only I am there... only me!

753
01:26:57,453 --> 01:26:57,919
God!

754
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:01,613
Today how free I
am feeling!

755
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:04,354
Like the body has forgotten
to make demands!

756
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,653
And that the heart has stopped
beating and creating sensation

757
01:27:07,463 --> 01:27:09,260
As if the life is in my fist!

758
01:27:10,032 --> 01:27:11,397
And death is like a game!

759
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:17,328
Now, I'll fall dead
then watch it

760
01:27:18,941 --> 01:27:21,034
I feel that, today all my wishes
have been fulfilled!

761
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:26,108
And the fun is that, today
I don't have any wish!

762
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:35,013
Atleast don't allow the wish
to live go away

763
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,286
The life has melted away and
become a enlightenment

764
01:27:38,494 --> 01:27:40,086
...And truth is my real form!

765
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:42,219
If tomorrow comes or not!

766
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:43,593
...l'll be there!

767
01:27:46,102 --> 01:27:48,332
Raju, save me

768
01:27:51,407 --> 01:27:52,032
...My breath...

769
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:56,335
Throw me into fire
I'll not burn

770
01:27:57,013 --> 01:27:58,708
Attack me with a sword, I'll not
get cut into pieces

771
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:03,380
You're proudness
You must die!

772
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,889
I am soul! I am eternal!

773
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:10,581
Death is like a thought!
Just how life is a thought

774
01:28:11,394 --> 01:28:14,329
There's no happiness, sorrow
distressed or the World

775
01:28:15,364 --> 01:28:16,797
Neither there's man...
nor the God!

776
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:21,897
Only I am there... only me
...me...

777
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:25,403
Only me

778
01:28:28,211 --> 01:28:31,806
Far away its raining
on the mountains

779
01:28:33,282 --> 01:28:35,079
My body got drenched!

780
01:28:36,619 --> 01:28:38,416
Come on, change it

781
01:29:16,092 --> 01:29:20,188
Raju, your fast has
become fruitful!

782
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:21,621
It's raining heavily!

783
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:24,226
Look how happily people
are dancing?

784
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,831
Raju... Raju... Get up! Raju

785
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,257
Mother, Raju is no more!

786
01:29:56,565 --> 01:30:00,296
No, my child! Raju is no
more in this body!

787
01:30:49,585 --> 01:30:52,418
There's no happiness, sorrow
distressed or the World

788
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,888
Neither there's man...
nor the God

789
01:30:55,891 --> 01:31:00,487
It's only me... lts only me
...only me!
