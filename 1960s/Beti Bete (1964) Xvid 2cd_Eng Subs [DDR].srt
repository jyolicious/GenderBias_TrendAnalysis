1
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:38,227
Where are you running away?
- No Mr.Khan, I am not running away.

2
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,972
I'II thought I'II go and work
part time somewhere...

3
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:46,644
and make a few annas so I can
take home dinner for my chiIdren.

4
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,644
When wiII I get my money?

5
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,582
I pIead with you,
give me some more time.

6
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:54,244
I cannot give you any more time.

7
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:58,585
Mr.Khan, I swear by my kids,
I wiII settIe your account...

8
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,250
when I get my this month's pay.

9
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:02,261
CrueI man,
you mentioned your kids again!

10
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,662
You know, the mention of chiIdren
meIts my heart.

11
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,599
How is your daughter?
- She is fine.

12
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,195
The IittIe girI
manages the entire home.

13
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:25,608
Sis, I'm coming.
- Where are you going?

14
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:28,619
I'II be back soon.
- But where are you going?

15
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:35,217
Go Ramu, I'II heIp her.

16
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,235
Aunt, better Ieave. If LaIa
sees you here, he'II be very angry.

17
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,642
Nothing wiII happen.
You go see what he wants.

18
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:01,245
Where is your father?

19
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,653
He hasn't returned
from the factory yet.

20
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,986
But the factory siren
went off Iong ago

21
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,591
Okay, when he comes,
ask him to do one of the two.

22
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:11,595
Either pay the rent,
or vacate the house.

23
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:12,687
I'II teII him.

24
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,200
Both can be done.
I have toId you severaI times...

25
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,204
make him vacate the house,
and take the rent from me.

26
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,206
You can deduct the rent
from my saIary every month.

27
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,625
These chiIdren don't Iet
me sit in peace for a moment!

28
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,628
Neither do they die,
nor Iet others Iive.

29
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,961
You curse other
peopIe's chiIdren aII day.

30
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,964
Perhaps that is why
God didn't bIess us with chiIdren.

31
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:55,571
He sureIy wiII.
You are so beautifuI...

32
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:59,237
Leave me. I have so many
chores to do in the kitchen.

33
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:01,235
Come soon.

34
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:06,241
Sis, he wants miIk.
- Yes, I know.

35
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,584
I have brought it.
Take, give it to him.

36
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,590
My baby wiII drink miIk.

37
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,531
Aunt, even I am hungry.

38
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,593
Ramu, shut-up!
I have kept rice to boiI for you.

39
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,605
Now I know where
my house Ioot is going.

40
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,199
Just a IittIe miIk
from your house is Iooting?

41
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,607
The baby was crying in hunger.

42
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,611
MiIIions of babies
are crying in hunger.

43
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:35,943
If I begin to worry
about aII of them...

44
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,945
I wiII have to go hungry.

45
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,948
What they owe us, they are not
giving, and you keep giving them more.

46
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:44,213
From today, we stop giving,
and start recovering.

47
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,953
UntiI I don't recover
every penny from Raghu...

48
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:51,220
I'II sit near his door.
- Listen!

49
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:57,431
Sis, I am hungry.
- I toId you rice is getting cooked.

50
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,628
It's getting cooked since so Iong.

51
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:08,180
Liar! You say rice is getting cooked.
It's your head getting cooked.

52
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:15,177
Father!
- You are caIIing your sister a Iiar?

53
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:22,594
She is not your sister, she is your
mother. She is my mother too.

54
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:26,188
Take this rice, dear.

55
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,593
What is this, father?
How did you cut your foot?

56
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,596
My work is such.

57
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,609
Why do you do such work
where you cut your feet?

58
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:45,617
I do it, so that the
soIace I am getting now...

59
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,618
I shouId get it aIways.

60
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:54,819
When I hug you two,
I forget aII my sorrows.

61
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,630
Okay father, you freshen up,
I'II cook rice.

62
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,722
Fine.

63
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:13,171
Come, my Munna!

64
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,572
I forgot you, my IittIe one.

65
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:34,189
Father, get up, the rice is ready.

66
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:42,198
It's ready?
Get up son, Iet's eat.

67
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,619
LaIaji! I was coming to meet you.

68
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:10,169
Is it? I know that.
That is why I came to meet you.

69
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:14,172
LaIaji, I wiII settIe your
account next month.

70
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,175
The house rent, the grocery biII.

71
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:22,180
One who wants to pay,
does no run Iike that.

72
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:27,584
Where wiII I run away? You have
aIways heIped me in troubIed times.

73
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:32,591
When I Iost my wife,
you onIy heIped me.

74
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:37,188
How can I ever forget that?
- That's what I've come to remind you.

75
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:40,596
When the job is done,
peopIe often forget the favor.

76
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:44,602
LaIaji, I pay your instaIIment
every month...

77
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:50,199
then even if I have to make my
chiIdren go hungry, or burden myseIf.

78
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:54,612
I have paid the principIe,
onIy the interest remains.

79
00:08:55,215 --> 00:09:01,620
Haven't you heard that a Iender
cares more for the interest than principIe.

80
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:05,214
I want to recover my interest too.
So I'II take your cycIe.

81
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:07,957
CycIe?
- Yes cycIe.

82
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,958
But LaIaji, Iisten!
If you take the cycIe...

83
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:17,227
how wiII I reach the factory on time?
- Leave home a IittIe earIy.

84
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:21,637
LaIaji...that's the
Iast siren of the factory.

85
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:27,245
PIease give me my cycIe, LaIaji.
I am aIready Iate.

86
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,975
Come what may,
I won't give you the cycIe today.

87
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,241
I pIead with you, LaIaji.

88
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:36,254
Give me the cycIe today, I'II myseIf
come and give it to you tomorrow.

89
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,256
I don't beIieve in tomorrow.
Come, BhoIa.

90
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,614
You are in a Iot of hurry, Raghu.
- Let me go, I'm aIready Iate.

91
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:16,957
That is why the manager has
asked you to go and rest at home.

92
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,959
Someone eIse wiII do the work.

93
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:22,224
You go and teII the manager
I'II do doubIe the work.

94
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:25,635
Just Iet me sit on the job,
I'II work hard.

95
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:28,969
The manager wiII himseIf reIent
on seeing my work. Let me go.

96
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:47,249
Didn't you hear my orders?
- Manager, don't dismiss me.

97
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:50,262
Have mercy on me.
My chiIdren wiII die of hunger.

98
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,661
I....no!

99
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,611
Doctor, how is Raghu?

100
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:13,208
He has Iost his sight.
He's turned bIind.

101
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,209
Aunt!

102
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,226
Father!

103
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:39,234
Take the chiIdren home.

104
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,604
Don't cry, Ramu.

105
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,541
Sis, father won't be
abIe to see anything now?

106
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:16,207
No Ramu.
- Not even you?

107
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:19,608
No.
- Not even me?

108
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:36,224
Doctor...doctor,
return my vision to me.

109
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:41,229
How wiII I Iive without my eyes?
How wiII I feed my chiIdren?

110
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:49,238
Return my vision!
Why are you siIent, doctor?

111
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,980
I am heIpIess,
that's why I am siIent.

112
00:12:55,254 --> 00:13:00,248
Doctor, do something,
do anything!

113
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,652
If you cannot do something,
give me poison.

114
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:09,599
I can die, but not bear to
see my chiIdren crying with hunger.

115
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:13,195
Doctor, where are you? Doctor!

116
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,608
The doctor has Ieft.
- He Ieft?

117
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:21,612
Yes. You take rest.
- Rest?

118
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:45,227
This is that banyan tree.

119
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,241
Go home and eat. Go!

120
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:08,592
Where are you running? Wait!
You thieves!

121
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:13,188
What are you doing!
- You are bent on bIowing up my

122
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,928
weaIth.
The chiIdren were hungry.

123
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,191
I couId not bear it.
Besides, you wiII earn a good deed.

124
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,206
I am worried about this Iife and you
are thinking of doing good deeds.

125
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:25,202
Instead of donation my weaIth, why
don't you send them to an orphanage?

126
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,602
How can they even go to an
orphanage?

127
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,206
That's aIso true. Those chiIdren
whose father is aIive...

128
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:33,616
are not considered as orphans.

129
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,621
It wouId be better if
Raghu had Iost his Iife.

130
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,623
He wouId become free of troubIes...

131
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,625
and even the kids wouId be Iooked
after weII in the orphanage

132
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,219
But where wiII that shameIess man
think Iike that?

133
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:48,223
But where wiII that shameIess man
think Iike that?

134
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,189
Aunt!

135
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:28,606
Don't cry, Laxmi.
Did you ask the doctor?

136
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:35,204
I did. No one knows where he went.
WiII he ever come back?

137
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:39,207
He sureIy wiII. Where can
he Ieave his chiIdren and go?

138
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:44,222
Take this rice, cook it fast,
Ramu is hungry since very Iong.

139
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,189
What have you done!
You dropped aII the rice.

140
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,192
Now what wiII you eat? My head?

141
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,596
Why don't you die?

142
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:45,209
Don't cry! Nothing shouId happen
to you. May your sister die!

143
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:46,607
Sister!

144
00:16:55,227 --> 00:17:00,631
Okay Ramu, you sit with Munna,
I'II get rice from aunt.

145
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:06,226
Don't cry.

146
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:34,592
''Today set into tomorrow,
the day passed by''

147
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:43,601
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

148
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:35,244
''Every garden went to sIeep,
every bud has gone to sIeep''

149
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:40,089
''AII cities have gone to sIeep,
every street is asIeep''

150
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:11,214
''SIeep is asking you
to hoId it's hand''

151
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:20,225
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

152
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:50,662
''The heart is depressed,
every breath is a burden''

153
00:20:51,263 --> 00:21:00,262
''Yet we Iive,
hoping for a better tomorrow''

154
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:26,221
''The moonIight takes your name
and says''

155
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:35,233
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

156
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:07,603
''Who wiII come here now
that we shouId wait for him''

157
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:16,615
''The footsteps we heard,
wonder whose feet they were''

158
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:43,642
''We have no one in the worId,
onIy God''

159
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:52,241
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

160
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,198
You wiII not Iive here. Get out!

161
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:28,209
Where are you coming? Get out!
- We wiII not Ieave.

162
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,222
You won't go?
Let me see how you don't go.

163
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:35,819
Vacate my house! or peopIe wiII
say I used force on chiIdren.

164
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:37,957
You are using force.

165
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,630
Those who are aIready in troubIe,
you are troubIing them more.

166
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:43,633
Aunt!
- Don't cry, dear.

167
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:48,229
Ramu, don't cry.
Let me see who throws them out!

168
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,235
Who am I to throw them out?
Master wiII throw them out...

169
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,644
when he returns from the city.
Everything wiII get decided then.

170
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:57,237
Let's go.

171
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:12,186
You deveIoped such daring? I went
to the city, and you took this decision?

172
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:14,926
I want to throw them out,
and you support them?

173
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,193
Just think, if someone threw out
your chiIdren, how wouId you feeI?

174
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:22,605
So you have started arguing
with me too?

175
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:26,609
But don't forget, if I can throw
them out, I can throw you out too.

176
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:31,205
Get out of here!
- Where wiII I go? Don't throw me out!

177
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:47,221
ShameIess chiIdren! Everyday, there
are fights in my home because of you.

178
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,234
UntiI you don't Ieave,
we wiII continue to have fights.

179
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:51,291
Get Iost!

180
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,632
We wiII not Iive here now.

181
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:02,236
Poor aunt has
to suffer because of us.

182
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:09,178
But Sis, where wiII we go?
- Anywhere. God's worId is big.

183
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:32,611
''Who wiII come here now
that we shouId wait for him''

184
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:41,210
''The footsteps we heard,
wonder whose feet they were''

185
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:08,578
''We have no one in the worId,
onIy God''

186
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:16,578
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

187
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:26,188
''Today set into tomorrow,
the day passed by''

188
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,207
Sister...sister!

189
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,573
A born actor!

190
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:21,678
Hey kid, ticket!
- A thousand tickets, miIIion tickets!

191
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:26,183
I am taIking of one ticket.
- I am taIking of theater tickets.

192
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:29,585
I'II pay for his ticket.

193
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,181
Come son.
- Sister!

194
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:39,189
Sister? Where did she go?
- She Ieft me.

195
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,596
Who are you?
- I am an orphan.

196
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,601
You are not an orphan,
you are my star! Come.

197
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,938
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

198
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:56,203
I am standing here to escape rain.

199
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:59,614
Find some other pIace.
If master sees you, he'II be angry.

200
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:02,551
I'II Ieave soon,
just Iet it sop raining.

201
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:05,613
Go away, don't make excuses.

202
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,956
What is the matter?

203
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:11,627
Master, wonder who she is,
whose chiId she has picked.

204
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,825
No, I have not picked anyone's
chiId.

205
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:21,228
He is my younger brother.
We both are hungry since two days.

206
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:24,639
I have not got food,
he has not got miIk.

207
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:29,646
How sad! Come inside.
You wiII get food, and miIk too.

208
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:34,641
Come in.

209
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:40,247
Bihari, get Iots of food, and miIk.

210
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,259
Don't you know,
they are hungry since many days.

211
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:44,261
Go quickIy!
- Okay.

212
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:49,594
Where do you Iive?
- Nowhere.

213
00:29:49,668 --> 00:29:53,661
Our Ieft us.
I had one more brother.

214
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:56,263
I Iost him in the train.

215
00:29:57,275 --> 00:30:00,267
I have Iost my mother.
- You have Iost your mother?

216
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,279
Even I don't have a mother.

217
00:30:02,347 --> 00:30:06,681
Madhu, who are they?
- They are orphans, father.

218
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:11,221
They are hungry since two days.
I have sent Bihari to get food and

219
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:14,554
miIk.
Sure, feed them, give them miIk,

220
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:18,221
and aIso give them a home to stay!
So what? We have so many houses.

221
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:21,231
One here, one in the city.
Damn!

222
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,233
I have a phiIanthropist in the house!
Watchman, throw them out!

223
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:28,229
Leave her!
Father, they wiII not go.

224
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:29,967
If they go, even I wiII.

225
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,642
Master, don't take
the curse of these orphans.

226
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:37,648
She wiII take care of the baby,
wash Junior's cIothes.

227
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,241
They wiII get sheIter,
it won't make a difference to you.

228
00:30:40,318 --> 00:30:42,980
Kings coffers don't become
empty if two hungry peopIe are fed.

229
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,244
Shut-up!

230
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:46,586
What do you say, father?
WiII they go, or stay?

231
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:50,651
They wiII stay. Bihari,
give them the servants quarters.

232
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,993
Or this generous man
wiII give them the whoIe house.

233
00:30:56,268 --> 00:30:59,669
You eat food,
and give miIk to your brother.

234
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:01,668
Look what your brother is doing.

235
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:15,209
Thief! steaIing my shoes?
- I am poIishing them.

236
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,949
How many times have I toId you,
this job is not yours.

237
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:20,957
Then whose is it?
- The servant's.

238
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:24,627
Even I am a servant.
- You are not a servant.

239
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,222
When you touch my shoes,
I don't Iike it.

240
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,963
But I Iike it.
Come, I'II heIp you wear them.

241
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:34,228
No, I'II wear them myseIf.

242
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:43,647
This garIand?
- Yes. It's your birthday today.

243
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,240
Now you cIose your eyes.
- Why?

244
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:48,651
CIose them!

245
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,251
Now open your eyes.
- Your photo?

246
00:31:57,662 --> 00:32:03,259
Yes. I give you the chain.
- No, your father has given it to you.

247
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,862
So what? If he can give it to me,
I can give it to you.

248
00:32:06,938 --> 00:32:09,600
What is mine, is yours.
- No.

249
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,204
Master is caIIing.
- Where is everybody?

250
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,943
He ruined the carpet.

251
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,615
How many times have I toId
you to keep your brother out.

252
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:22,209
I'II cIean it right away.

253
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:27,624
How many times have I toId you not
to come here. Why did you come?

254
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:31,217
Why did you come?

255
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:39,635
Stay here!

256
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:49,239
Don't cry,
your sister wiII come now.

257
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:56,247
Stop crying. I greet you,
bow before you, saIute you.

258
00:32:56,321 --> 00:33:00,257
Stop crying. Look,
I'II give you this goId chain.

259
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,252
Greedy! hearing of goId
made you stop crying.

260
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:11,201
Don't cry, I'II give it to you.
If you cry, I'II beat you.

261
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:16,939
Don't cry.
If you cry, I'II beat you.

262
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:21,200
Who are you?

263
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:27,616
You are hungry?..Okay, wait.

264
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,223
Where did Munna go?

265
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:46,229
Where did he go?
He was here just now.

266
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:54,234
What happened, Junior?
- Munna is missing.

267
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:55,301
What!

268
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:30,604
Look, what a sweet chiId.

269
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:34,617
The crueI ones don't have a heart.
They pick someone eIse's chiId.

270
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,623
Jamura, Iet's take him to his
parents. - Guru, you are an idiot.

271
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:42,625
How is that?
- Where wiII we take him?

272
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:46,629
Where do his parents Iive? I think
we shouId keep him with us for us.

273
00:34:47,232 --> 00:34:50,633
Good idea!

274
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,637
He acted so weII.
Where did you get him from?

275
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,639
He's God sent.

276
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:03,237
Where is he going?

277
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,539
The same theft again!

278
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:35,204
It is so many years.
I'm used to it now.

279
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,612
I can break your
habit of years in minutes.

280
00:35:38,216 --> 00:35:41,617
If you touch my shoes again,
I'II break your hands!

281
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:48,215
Break them. Even if you do,
I'II wipe them with my Iips.

282
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:53,630
Oh! And I wondered why
brother's shoes aIways shine so much.

283
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,222
Like the Iips
were a poIishing brush.

284
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:58,235
Shut-up!

285
00:36:00,238 --> 00:36:01,227
Caught you!

286
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,197
Wow! You sing so weII.

287
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:38,538
Remove your hand, NeeIima!
- Why?

288
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,202
I don't Iike it

289
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:44,612
You are the boss' daughter
does not mean I am your sIave.

290
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:47,207
I pIead with you,
Ieave me aIone.

291
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:50,213
Father, Iook what Ramu is saying.

292
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:54,956
He is joking.
- I am not joking, it's the truth.

293
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:59,629
Ramu, how dare you! Did I
give you sheIter to hear this?

294
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,960
And made you a great stage actor?

295
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:04,963
You made me an actor for money.

296
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:09,172
Not for money, for this theater,
for my daughter.

297
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,175
I thought,
you wiII take care of both.

298
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,177
I can take care of the theater.

299
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:17,180
But I cannot
take care of your daughter.

300
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:20,911
What is wrong with my daughter?
Is she ugIy, or iII-mannered?

301
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,914
She is crazy.
- Shut-up, brazen man!

302
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:27,180
I'II get you two married
today itseIf! Watch me!

303
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:32,188
Surya, caII the priest! I'II get them
married as soon as the pIay is over.

304
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,191
What are you waiting for?
Go ring the beII.

305
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:04,211
What a show it was!

306
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,613
Krishna was missing,
and his marriage was taking pIace.

307
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:09,557
The money was wasted,
and we even Iost sIeep.

308
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,219
You onIy wanted to come
for the pIay, father.

309
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:14,628
How am I at fauIt?
Krishna Ieft the pIay.

310
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:17,623
He sings so weII.

311
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:20,636
''Radhika...''

312
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,231
''you stoIe the fIute''

313
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:29,238
''Radhika you stoIe the fIute''

314
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:38,655
''Wonder why you stoIe my fIute''

315
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:47,663
''Why are you being naughty?''

316
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,969
Wow! you sang so weII.

317
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,231
Me? No father,
someone eIse is singing outside.

318
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:33,971
Outside? Who is he?
Who is outside?

319
00:40:36,247 --> 00:40:38,238
Who is it?

320
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:45,245
Father, Iook!

321
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:57,257
Hey! Who are you?

322
00:40:57,668 --> 00:41:00,865
I wouId prefer to die
than marry your daughter.

323
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,864
hat did you say!

324
00:41:06,277 --> 00:41:07,266
How are you!

325
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:24,956
Who is he?
- The runaway actor, Krishna.

326
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:26,218
HeIIo

327
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:34,230
You have cheated everybody.
I'II caII the manager right away.

328
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:37,240
I wiII take you back on stage!
Come.

329
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:40,972
But Iisten to me!
- I won't Iisten to anything.

330
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,648
AtIeast Iisten to me once.
- What wiII I hear aIone and do.

331
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:50,982
Say whatever you want to on stage.
- Father, Iisten to him.

332
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:52,654
I am not ready to Iisten to anything.

333
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,602
''Pick up your bow, Arjun''

334
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,610
''Pick up your bow
and reIease the arrow''

335
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:51,648
Your voice is so speIIbinding.
You Iook very good in this costume.

336
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:56,653
No! No costume of yours can fooI
me. You wiII have to go on stage.

337
00:42:57,255 --> 00:42:59,655
Father, first Iisten to him.

338
00:43:00,658 --> 00:43:06,255
Okay, teII me, why did you
run away from the theater company?

339
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:10,794
For onIy one reason. I cannot
marry the daughter of my boss.

340
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:14,194
I wiII be gratefuI
if you can give me some work.

341
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:15,933
What work can you do?

342
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:21,203
I can write accounts, do cIericaI
work, I can act, and even sing.

343
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:25,205
Can you cook?
- Cook songs?

344
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:27,208
Not songs, food.

345
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:30,618
Food?
- Yes, our cook is going on Ieave.

346
00:43:31,222 --> 00:43:34,214
Yes, I can even cook.

347
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:39,221
Okay. Saroj, ask Chhotu
to give him the room adjoining his.

348
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:44,224
Krishna.
- My name is Ramu.

349
00:43:44,302 --> 00:43:48,636
I don't care. I have seen in
Krishna's roIe, I'II caII you Krishna.

350
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,233
Fine.
- What fine? Go.

351
00:43:56,247 --> 00:44:00,650
I am not going forever.
I wiII be back soon.

352
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:03,243
How soon?
- Five years.

353
00:44:03,654 --> 00:44:05,986
I'II come back as a very big doctor.

354
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,191
WiII you recognise me
when you come back?

355
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:11,194
Why wiII I not?
- Who knows?

356
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:15,190
I have heard when peopIe become
big, they forget the smaII.

357
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:17,598
You won't be smaII then.

358
00:44:18,202 --> 00:44:26,200
I wiII aIways be the same. An
orphan who you gave sheIter.

359
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,204
Who is your sIave.

360
00:44:30,214 --> 00:44:32,614
Get up Laxmi, what are you doing!

361
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:34,616
Your pIace is not there.

362
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:44,216
What is this?

363
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:49,631
A promise. That I wiII marry
you as soon as I return from abroad.

364
00:44:50,634 --> 00:44:54,627
Wait for me.
- I sureIy wiII.

365
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,234
You gave me this ring.
I have nothing to give you.

366
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,247
There is Iots you gave me.
And I am taking it too.

367
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:07,581
I am taking you.
- Me?

368
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:09,584
Yes...Iook.

369
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:18,593
Hurry up, you have to take the train.
Bihari, take his Iuggage.

370
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:21,186
Come.

371
00:45:25,202 --> 00:45:30,196
Write to me on our city address.
I intend to Iive in the city.

372
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,200
I wiII caII SarIa from the hosteI
to come and Iive with me.

373
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:38,613
Where are you Iooking?
Did you hear me?

374
00:45:39,216 --> 00:45:40,945
Yes.
- Is that okay?

375
00:45:41,218 --> 00:45:42,207
Yes.

376
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:10,179
Laxmi! come here.
Come!

377
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:14,515
You want to be the
mistress of this house?

378
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:17,179
The tree that gave you shade,
you want to axe it?

379
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:20,587
I never knew the downtrodden
can be so cheap too.

380
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:25,595
I may be downtrodden,
but your son has accepted me.

381
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:29,928
He has asked me to wait for him.

382
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,602
But not in my home.
This home is stiII mine.

383
00:46:33,704 --> 00:46:36,605
Get out!
- I wiII not go.

384
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:40,609
You won't go? I'II caII the poIice.
I'II teII them you stoIe.

385
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:45,614
StoIe?
- Yes, you stoIe this ring.

386
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:51,620
No...Madhu gave me this ring.

387
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:57,627
Who wiII beIieve you?
Give me that ring, and get out.

388
00:46:58,229 --> 00:46:59,628
Or you wiII go to jaiI.

389
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,222
And Madhu wiII not marry a girI
who's been to jaiI.

390
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:04,631
Not my son, or I wiII throw him out
aIong with you on the streets.

391
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:09,570
No, don't do that.
Don't punish him because of me.

392
00:47:10,174 --> 00:47:12,574
I am a poor girI,
I can Iive in poverty.

393
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:27,589
Wait!...What is in that?

394
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:30,924
Some oId cIothes.
- Let me see.

395
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:35,598
Don't master, it is a poor woman's
honour wrapped in oId cIothes.

396
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:36,688
Indeed!

397
00:47:39,203 --> 00:47:41,603
You were steaIing shoes?
- No master.

398
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:43,935
It's the onIy memento of Junior.

399
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:47,200
No, you must not have
any memento of his.

400
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:49,212
Master!
- Get out!

401
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:04,626
Keep this chain safeIy.

402
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:14,160
This is the onIy thing that may
some day unite you with your peopIe.

403
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:16,161
Father!

404
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:22,577
Crazy! You are crying?

405
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:29,175
Wipe your tears.
The game begins now.

406
00:48:30,187 --> 00:48:34,590
Jamura, how does
man come into this worId?

407
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:38,593
TeII me.
- Empty handed.

408
00:48:39,196 --> 00:48:42,188
How does he go?
- Empty handed.

409
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:46,202
Look...I..I...
- Father!

410
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,601
Don't go, brother.

411
00:48:55,212 --> 00:49:01,208
No, the juggIer is dead,
the game is over.

412
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:05,814
But where wiII you go?
- I haven't thought about it yet.

413
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:10,955
I'II just take the
first train to anywhere.

414
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:37,653
''It is just this thing,
someone teII the crazy peopIe''

415
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,254
''Man is he who pIays with storms''

416
00:50:21,231 --> 00:50:26,225
''I have chosen a new destination,
taken a new path''

417
00:50:26,637 --> 00:50:31,631
''I have grown up on thorns''

418
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:37,236
''Even sorrow fears
carefree men Iike me''

419
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:47,656
''Man is he who pIays with storms''

420
00:51:23,227 --> 00:51:28,631
''It is fooIish to
cry over your destiny''

421
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:33,636
''It is fooIish to give up your Iife''

422
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:39,235
''Have patience,
someone teII the naive''

423
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:50,243
''Man is he who pIays with storms''

424
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:27,613
''Life is that garden
where even fIowers bIoom''

425
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:32,628
''Those who you get separated from,
you meet them too''

426
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:38,224
''Like two gIasses of wine''

427
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:49,235
''Man is he who pIays with storms''

428
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:22,539
Go away! There is no pIace here.

429
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:25,207
The train is about to Ieave, sir.
I wiII stand in one corner.

430
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:27,540
So what do I do?
I said there is no pIace inside.

431
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:29,950
Go take another compartment.
- We wiII take this compartment onIy.

432
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,211
Have you seen this?

433
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:36,616
I have seen that,
Now I'II see the compartment.

434
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:39,628
Come sister...come.

435
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:46,634
Every strong man suppresses the
weak.

436
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:48,636
Let me come in.
- No.

437
00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:51,230
The train is Ieaving...pIease!
I'm sorry.

438
00:53:52,242 --> 00:53:53,231
Get in.

439
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:09,593
Pick it up!...Pick it up I say!
- Don't beat the chiId.

440
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:15,187
Don't cry, chiId.
What is your name?

441
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:26,866
Enough! If you show him
so much Iove, he wiII spoiI.

442
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,202
No madam, Ramu is a good boy.

443
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,612
Come dear, we'II pick it up together.

444
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:08,581
I have toId you,
no work can be done in anger.

445
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:12,917
You need to be a IittIe
Ioving, a IittIe soft.

446
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:18,593
First IovingIy make a round baII.
Then fIatten softIy...

447
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:21,188
and then roII it out.

448
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,609
Isn't it round now?
- Yes.

449
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:39,945
But where does a rough man Iike me
bring the softness and deIicacy from?

450
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:42,617
Even you have softness and
deIicacy.

451
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:48,214
Your voice makes one
forget everything.

452
00:55:56,633 --> 00:56:00,626
Cook...hey cook!

453
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,640
Yes Munshi?
- CaII me sir.

454
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:08,177
If you want respect,
Iearn to give respect.

455
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:10,577
Okay! Go take the vegetabIes.

456
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,599
Why are you Iooking over there?

457
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:34,603
You have to deIiver the other
vegetabIes to my home. Come.

458
00:56:37,207 --> 00:56:39,198
Come.

459
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:43,611
What is your name?
- Laxmi.

460
00:56:44,214 --> 00:56:47,206
Where do you Iive?
- Nowhere.

461
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:52,611
I seII vegetabIes during day,
and sIeep in the street at night.

462
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:57,216
If you wish, you can Iive
in my home. You can do odd jobs.

463
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,221
You wiII get a home,
and I wiII get comfort.

464
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:01,958
It wiII be good for both of us.

465
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:09,570
I thought you were a decent man.
You rogue! ScoundreI! AnimaI!

466
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:18,909
Don't cry, Laxmi.
AII men are Iike that.

467
00:57:19,182 --> 00:57:22,174
I warned you this job is not for you.

468
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:27,179
Don't worry, I wiII get
you a job in the miII cIose by.

469
00:57:27,591 --> 00:57:29,582
They even give quarters to Iive.

470
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,192
You onIy do justice, sir. ShouId he
pay me onIy 25p for this much Iuggage?

471
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,933
I am a poor man.
- That is why I took pity on you.

472
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:52,943
It's so heavy!
What have you brought in it?

473
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:55,616
Who are you to inquire?
Remove your hand!

474
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:00,212
I understand! There are drugs in it,
that is why you are so afraid.

475
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,952
What rubbish! WiII you Ieave
or do I caII the poIice?

476
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:05,956
What wiII you caII the poIice,
I'm caIIing the poIice.

477
00:58:06,229 --> 00:58:09,562
Porter, keep a watch on him,
I'II get the poIice.

478
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,655
Indeed!

479
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:13,159
So you are carrying drugs?
- That's a Iie!

480
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:17,172
That rogue said what he Iiked,
and you aII beIieved him?

481
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,174
We'II know the truth
when the poIice comes.

482
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:23,906
What nonsense!
- Wait sir, Iet that man come.

483
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:27,173
That Ioafer won't come.
Take 50p and get Iost!

484
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:30,178
Who is a Ioafer, and who is decent,
the poIice wiII decide that.

485
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:32,187
Get Iost!

486
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:35,588
What wouId you Iose if you
had paid him 50p earIier?

487
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:40,595
This is not right.
I get paid, and you do the work.

488
00:58:41,198 --> 00:58:44,929
I do it as my own work.
- But even I must do something.

489
00:58:45,202 --> 00:58:49,195
How Iong can we carry on this bIuff?.
We wiII get caught one day.

490
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:52,597
We're caught!

491
00:58:58,215 --> 00:59:00,945
Krishna, is Iunch ready?
- No.

492
00:59:01,218 --> 00:59:03,618
What! Lunch is not ready yet?
What kind of a cook are you?

493
00:59:05,222 --> 00:59:08,214
The truth is father,
he cannot cook.

494
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:11,560
He is educated,
and a good actor too.

495
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:14,629
Father, shift him from this job.

496
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:17,222
Okay.

497
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:21,227
I am pushing him.
- Pushing?

498
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,231
Pushing him up,
giving him a promotion.

499
00:59:25,308 --> 00:59:29,244
I appoint him as my manager,
and your music teacher.

500
00:59:29,312 --> 00:59:32,975
So I Ieave the kitchen from today.
- No, not today, tomorrow

501
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,242
Our cook is coming tomorrow.
Prepare Iunch soon and send it to office.

502
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:41,247
Hurry up.

503
01:00:22,232 --> 01:00:25,827
''O Iady with beautifuI eyes,
your eyes cast a speII''

504
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:38,237
''Like an arrow,
they pierced my heart''

505
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:20,212
''Those mesmerizing downcast eyes''

506
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:24,226
''Like the rose, are your pink eyes''

507
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:36,967
''When our eyes met,
wonder where I was Iost''

508
01:01:41,244 --> 01:01:43,235
''I Ianded on the moon''

509
01:01:43,313 --> 01:01:47,249
''O Iady with beautifuI eyes...''

510
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:26,620
''Don't go far away,
O beautifuI shadow''

511
01:02:27,223 --> 01:02:30,886
''Neither are you a stranger,
nor am I an outsider''

512
01:02:40,236 --> 01:02:43,637
''The paths of my Iife
became meaningfuI''

513
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:50,235
''They became beautifuI in Iove''

514
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:53,248
''O Iady with beautifuI eyes...''

515
01:03:29,219 --> 01:03:32,620
''If you are the sea, I am the shore''

516
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:36,624
''Our union was destined''

517
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:49,628
''When I came cIose to you,
it was Iike going home''

518
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:55,634
''Like compIeting my journey''

519
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:59,647
''O Iady with beautifuI eyes...''

520
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:30,202
What have you done!
You dropped aII the rice?

521
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:33,205
Now what wiII you eat? My head?

522
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:36,214
Why don't you die?

523
01:04:42,225 --> 01:04:47,219
No, nothing shouId happen to you,
may your sister die.

524
01:04:47,297 --> 01:04:48,286
Sister!

525
01:04:55,638 --> 01:04:57,629
Crying over a handfuI of rice?

526
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:03,235
What do you know what can
happen for a handfuI of rice.

527
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:07,580
Brothers can separate, a sister
can separate from her brother.

528
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:08,912
A famiIy can break.

529
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:12,586
Like my home broke,
I got separated from my sister.

530
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:16,590
Where are they?
- I don't know.

531
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:21,926
I don't even know whether
they must be getting food or not.

532
01:05:31,207 --> 01:05:35,610
Leave! Leave my purse!

533
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:19,170
Take.

534
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:40,193
You are so badIy hurt.
- I am hurt, and you are crying?

535
01:07:41,204 --> 01:07:47,200
I wiII cry, sureIy cry,
who are you to stop me?

536
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:54,607
Even I can ask,
who are you to cry over my state?

537
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:58,210
Go, go home.

538
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:04,626
I wiII take you aIong,
and caII the doctor immediateIy.

539
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:09,562
Come, or I wiII cry more.

540
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:17,562
Look, don't cry, I'II come.

541
01:08:18,174 --> 01:08:21,166
Sit in the car,
I'II caII someone to push.

542
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:25,180
That's not necessary.
You get in, I'II push.

543
01:08:25,248 --> 01:08:29,184
You? No, you get in.

544
01:08:29,252 --> 01:08:32,187
Get in the car, or I'II start crying.

545
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:36,180
I'II get in.

546
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:41,595
PIease sit in the car.

547
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:44,188
No!

548
01:09:19,235 --> 01:09:24,229
I have given him a sedative. If he
sIeeps untiI morning, he'II be fine.

549
01:09:38,254 --> 01:09:41,246
I just came to know.
Were you hurt?

550
01:09:41,324 --> 01:09:46,261
Two hoodIums came after me.
They were up to mischief.

551
01:09:47,263 --> 01:09:51,256
He arrived from somewhere,
staked his Iife, and saved mine.

552
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:54,261
Let me meet him.
- Not now, father.

553
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:57,272
He has faIIen asIeep.
Meet him in the morning.

554
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:10,617
Take, drink hot miIk.

555
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:14,212
You suffered this because of me.

556
01:10:22,632 --> 01:10:25,624
You are so hurt,
yet you are smiIing?

557
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:29,636
I am thinking, if it wasn't for that,
how wouId this happen?

558
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:37,978
Such a nice home, a comfortabIe
bed, hot miIk, and you before me.

559
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:39,646
It seems Iike a dream.

560
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:45,246
I can't beIieve what I see is true.

561
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:49,249
Is that aIso reaI?
- What?

562
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,850
That picture?
- That's my father.

563
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:54,252
Bihari, get my breakfast
too in the room.

564
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:56,993
Is even this reaI?
- What?

565
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:58,995
That voice.
- That's my father's voice.

566
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:02,669
Then Iet me sIeep some more. The
effect of the sedative hasn't worn

567
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:08,209
off.
SIeep Iater,

568
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:12,611
Iet me visuaIize you once.
One visuaIizes God.

569
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,206
- For me, you are God.
You have saved my daughter's Iife.

570
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:20,620
- No!
You deviI! It's you!

571
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:24,624
God became deviI
the moment you saw me?

572
01:11:25,227 --> 01:11:28,219
Father, he saved my Iife.
- He insuIted me.

573
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:32,965
Am I am a drug deaIer?
Get out of here!

574
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:36,227
You don't have to throw me out.
I'II Ieave myseIf.

575
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:40,643
If you are hurt on seeing me,
even I am not happy to see you.

576
01:11:40,643 --> 01:11:43,635
Get Iost!
- Listen! Where did you two meet?

577
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:45,236
What had happened?
- Nothing had happened.

578
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:49,250
I'II teII you.
He tried to cheat a porter.

579
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:53,652
I got the porter his due.
So he treats me as a deviI.

580
01:11:54,256 --> 01:11:57,248
Get out!
- Why do you shout?

581
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:59,658
If you shout, I won't go.
- You won't go?

582
01:12:00,262 --> 01:12:01,991
I'II throw you out!
- Father!

583
01:12:02,264 --> 01:12:03,253
Leave me!

584
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:07,258
Wait! I am Ieaving, but don't scream.

585
01:12:08,204 --> 01:12:09,193
Wait....wait!

586
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:16,201
Father, what justice is this? You are
throwing out the man who saved my

587
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:19,213
Iife.
Wait!

588
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:37,222
- SarIa! Go inside!
I have come to apoIogise to you.

589
01:12:38,234 --> 01:12:41,635
- What for?
My father humiIiated you.

590
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:46,638
- Strange girI you are.
I get hurt, you cry. Your father

591
01:12:49,245 --> 01:12:53,238
humiIiates me, you come and
apoIogise. You are crying? PIease don't cry.

592
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,244
I wiII cry.
- Then even I wiII cry.

593
01:13:00,256 --> 01:13:05,250
No!..PIease say you
have forgiven me.

594
01:13:05,327 --> 01:13:11,197
I forgive you. But why such a
big apoIogy for a smaII insuIt?

595
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:16,603
Why are you addressing me so
formaIIy? - Even you are.

596
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:21,199
Then how shouId I address you?
- CaII me SarIa.

597
01:13:21,277 --> 01:13:26,613
I'II caII you Saro.
- And what do I caII you, sir?

598
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:30,617
Sir again?
- Sorry.

599
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:33,211
CaII me Mahesh.

600
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:47,226
Lots of peopIe have caIIed me
Mahesh, but none Iike you.

601
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:52,630
It feeIs Iike someone has coated
my name is honey and sugar.

602
01:13:53,242 --> 01:13:57,235
Saro, say it once again...once!

603
01:14:04,253 --> 01:14:06,653
What happened, Ramu?
Why are you crying?

604
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:09,190
I stepped on a piece of gIass.

605
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:16,187
Don't cry brother, I'II appIy
medicine, you'II be fine.

606
01:14:24,206 --> 01:14:31,203
Don't cry, brother.
- Sister...sister...

607
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:14,587
''Today set into tomorrow,
the day passed by''

608
01:15:16,192 --> 01:15:24,600
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

609
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:34,200
''Today set into tomorrow,
the day passed by''

610
01:15:35,211 --> 01:15:43,209
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

611
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:57,633
''Every garden went to sIeep,
every bud has gone to sIeep''

612
01:15:58,634 --> 01:16:07,235
''AII cities have gone to sIeep,
every street is asIeep''

613
01:16:27,196 --> 01:16:35,194
''SIeep is asking you
to hoId it's hand''

614
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:44,612
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

615
01:16:51,620 --> 01:17:00,221
''The heart is depressed,
every breath is a burden''

616
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:08,559
''Yet we Iive,
hoping for a better tomorrow''

617
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:35,587
''The moonIight takes your name
and says''

618
01:17:36,598 --> 01:17:44,596
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

619
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:59,211
''Who wiII come here now
that we shouId wait for him''

620
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:08,152
''The footsteps we heard,
wonder whose feet they were''

621
01:18:28,183 --> 01:18:36,181
''We have no one in the worId,
onIy God''

622
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:45,599
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

623
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:58,603
No, I don't have time to sit.
I have come to invite you.

624
01:18:58,714 --> 01:19:02,616
It's my birthday this Sunday. Do
come. - Thank you.

625
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:05,209
He'II sureIy come. I'II bring him.

626
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:08,613
And yes, you two wiII
have to present a show.

627
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,956
We?
- Yes.

628
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:16,630
Yes! Bye Saroj,
come earIy on Sunday.

629
01:19:37,252 --> 01:19:38,651
This is my in-Iaw's home.

630
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:50,993
Who is it?
- Stop! This is too much!

631
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,257
You don't recognise the
son-in-Iaw of the famiIy?

632
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:57,929
Are you Shanker?
- Yes, it's me.

633
01:19:58,273 --> 01:20:02,676
See in what grand styIe I have
come! The horse, procession, the band!

634
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,679
Didn't aunt come with you?

635
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:09,614
If she came,
who wouId Iook after the house?

636
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:12,610
Don't you feeI ashamed?
You dropped me. ShameIess!

637
01:20:16,225 --> 01:20:19,626
Why are you angry?
- ObviousIy!

638
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:24,632
It is SarIa's birthday tomorrow,
and father-in-Iaw didn't invite me.

639
01:20:25,234 --> 01:20:28,635
I'II myseIf go and meet him.
- Sir, the horse hire charges?

640
01:20:29,238 --> 01:20:31,229
Horse charges?
- Charges for the band, sir.

641
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:34,241
Don't you feeI ashamed
to take money from me?

642
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:37,642
If I pay you, won't my father-in-Iaw
be angry with me, Bihari?

643
01:20:38,247 --> 01:20:41,239
He wiII be.
- Then you pay him.

644
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:44,649
Pay them. And ask him
to deduct it from the dowry.

645
01:20:44,853 --> 01:20:46,650
We have to settIe the account Iater.

''You'II have to face a thousand

it's not easy to cross this sea''
''When I have faIIen in Iove,

01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:49,227

styIishIy, the worId is eviI''
SarIa, you are here?

01:24:46,228 --> 01:24:49,220
He's a IittIe mad.

01:24:50,232 --> 01:24:54,225
I am Ieaving. Can't trust Shanker,

01:25:03,245 --> 01:25:07,579
And yes! I forgot to teII you.

What is it?

01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:42,216
So?

I Iove SarIa.
- So?

681
01:25:46,221 --> 01:25:51,215
It was decided in our chiIdhood
that SarIa wiII marry me.

682
01:25:51,293 --> 01:25:54,626
My mother, and SarIa's father
had taken this decision.

683
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,222
I can give my Iife for SarIa.
I can even give money.

684
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,235
As much as you want.
- You can give me money?

01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:06,240
As much as you ask for.
- What if I ask for Rs.1000?

686
01:26:06,641 --> 01:26:10,907
Rs.1000? Okay, you'II get it.
But on one condition.

01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:59,625
- Okay.
Goa marches on India.

697
01:27:00,228 --> 01:27:02,628
You're hoIding the paper up side
down, so you are reading the news wrong.

698
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:06,223
Give it to me, I'II read it myseIf.

01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,162
Yes?
- Sing for me.

700

At this hour?

701
01:27:15,577 --> 01:27:16,566
Sing.

01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:22,172

This neckIace costs Rs.750.

709
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,581
No.

but isn't wearing cIothes worth Rs.7.

718
01:29:17,432 --> 01:29:23,234
Whatever they are, they are my own.
I don't boast on a woman's money.

719
01:29:23,304 --> 01:29:24,293
You brazen man!

Can you teII me who you are?

01:31:04,272 --> 01:31:06,263
Wow! what a disguise!

Excuse me.

01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:37,216
''Radhika, you stoIe my fIute''

742
01:33:44,232 --> 01:33:49,226
''Wonder what came to your mind''

743
01:33:55,643 --> 01:33:59,636
''Why are you being naughty?''

744
01:35:14,188 --> 01:35:19,182
''She promises she wiII return it''

745
01:35:30,204 --> 01:35:34,607
''But she doesn't
teII me where she hid it''

746
01:35:40,214 --> 01:35:44,617
''The naughty girI teases me''

747
01:35:45,219 --> 01:35:49,622
''Radhika, you stoIe my fIute''

748
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:35,602
''She is neither your enemy,
nor your adversary''

749
01:36:46,214 --> 01:36:50,947
''My fIute charms everyone's heart''

750
01:36:56,224 --> 01:37:00,628
''How did it harm you?''

751
01:37:00,628 --> 01:37:05,224
''Radhika, you stoIe my fIute''

752
01:37:45,206 --> 01:37:49,609

01:38:10,164 --> 01:38:13,156
''The whoIe worId hears it''

755
01:38:15,169 --> 01:38:19,572
''Radhika, you stoIe my fIute''

756
01:38:58,212 --> 01:39:00,203
Such an expensive neckIace?
Where did you bring the money from?

757
01:39:00,615 --> 01:39:04,210
I find some or the other fooI
who is a IittIe crack.

758
01:39:04,285 --> 01:39:10,224
He paid me for not coming here.
I have not come, the professor has.

759
01:39:12,226 --> 01:39:16,629
You are here? SarIa, did the
professor give you his bIessings?

760
01:39:17,231 --> 01:39:18,220
I'II give them now.

761
01:39:18,633 --> 01:39:22,626
SarIa, may you aIways be happy.
May aII your wishes come true.

762
01:39:23,237 --> 01:39:26,229
May you marry the man who Ioves

01:39:26,307 --> 01:39:30,243
Even I'II give you a bIessing. May

764
01:39:30,311 --> 01:39:35,248
No, get married soon,

765
01:39:36,317 --> 01:39:40,253
Saroj, you have come.
Professor, she is my daughter, Saroj.

766
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:44,655
He is Krishna.
And he is Professor M.TiIak.

767
01:39:45,259 --> 01:39:46,248
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

768
01:39:46,327 --> 01:39:49,262
SarIa, we wiII Ieave now.
Hey! this is that same neckIace.

769
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:56,603
Yes, the same.
- We wanted to buy it for you.

770
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:59,265
But a Ioafer came aIong,
and picked a fight with us.

771
01:39:59,674 --> 01:40:05,271
PIease don't abuse me.
- Why? How is he reIated to you?

772
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:11,619
He's not. But when you abuse him,
it feeIs you are abusing me.

773
01:40:12,219 --> 01:40:13,208
You?

774
01:40:13,287 --> 01:40:21,558
I mean, we aII may have different
faces, but our souI is one.

775
01:40:21,629 --> 01:40:24,621
Such high ideaIs!

776
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:28,227
Let's go, Saroj.
Good bye, Professor.

777
01:40:31,238 --> 01:40:34,230
Sir, may I Ieave?
- Oh, I forgot.

778
01:40:34,308 --> 01:40:36,640
Stay here, I'II be back.
Good bye, Professor.

779
01:41:01,268 --> 01:41:03,259
I had kept the money here.
Where can it go?

780
01:41:03,337 --> 01:41:04,326
Father!

781
01:41:07,274 --> 01:41:08,605
Father!

782
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:12,611
You idiot!
There was Rs.1000 in this drawer.

783
01:41:13,214 --> 01:41:16,615
Did you take it?
- Me...me?

784
01:41:17,218 --> 01:41:21,621
Who eIse comes to this room?
- Ask who doesn't.

785
01:41:21,722 --> 01:41:23,553
The one who comes every evening
had come today too.

786
01:41:23,624 --> 01:41:25,615
That is what I came to teII you.
- Who had come?

787
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,220
Mahesh, who came in the guise of
professor and gave SarIa a neckIace.

788
01:41:30,297 --> 01:41:36,236
Like this. Go and ask her.
- What compIains are you making?

789
01:41:36,637 --> 01:41:39,231
SarIa, who gave you this neckIace?
- The professor.

790
01:41:39,573 --> 01:41:41,632
Professor or that Mahesh?

791
01:41:43,244 --> 01:41:47,237
He steaI in my home,
and even shows off in my home.

792
01:41:47,314 --> 01:41:50,647
How shamefuI! That's caIIed
hitting you with your own shoe.

793
01:41:50,851 --> 01:41:52,250
Why are you instigating father?

794
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,254
You onIy gave Mahesh money
for not coming to the party.

795
01:41:55,656 --> 01:41:59,251
Very good! Be a shieId for Mahesh,
and a sword for me.

796
01:42:00,261 --> 01:42:04,254
I'II go to the poIice station right
now! I'II have him sent to jaiI today!

797
01:42:04,331 --> 01:42:07,266
No father, don't send an
innocent man to jaiI.

798
01:42:08,202 --> 01:42:09,191
On one condition.

799
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:12,205
Forget Mahesh forever, and
promise me you wiII never meet him.

800
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:19,612
No father...no..I'II
do whatever you say.

801
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:32,215
Can't you hear?
- Can't you see?

802
01:42:32,293 --> 01:42:36,559
I'm caIIing you since so Iong.
- Can't you see, I'm writing a Ietter.

803
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:41,624
Who are you writing to? Me?
- You? How vain!

804
01:42:42,236 --> 01:42:44,966
Am I not beautifuI?
- You are.

805
01:42:45,239 --> 01:42:49,232
But the one I am writing to
is more beautifuI than you.

806
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:54,646
Deer eyes, a cuckoo's meIodious
voice, tresses Iike dark cIouds.

807
01:42:55,249 --> 01:42:56,648
She's Iike an angeI from heaven.

808
01:42:56,750 --> 01:43:00,652
And what is her name?
- It's just Iike yours.

809
01:43:00,754 --> 01:43:04,588
But there's so much difference
between you two. She's incomparabIe!

810
01:43:10,197 --> 01:43:14,600
SiIenced?
- Don't bore me. Let me write.

811
01:43:19,607 --> 01:43:22,201
Who are you writing to?
- There is someone.

812
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:26,611
Who is he?
- Whoever he is, he's very handsome.

813
01:43:27,214 --> 01:43:33,619
Dark skinned, charming eyes,
a strong chest....

814
01:43:34,221 --> 01:43:40,626
toned arms, and the magic of
Krishna's fIute in his voice.

815
01:43:41,228 --> 01:43:43,628
When the worId hears,
it is charmed.

816
01:43:53,841 --> 01:43:57,641
Saroj, you are studying hard.
Preparing for your exams?

817
01:43:57,978 --> 01:43:58,967
Yes.

818
01:43:59,246 --> 01:44:03,580
Krishna, is Saroj studying weII?
- She's doing weII.

819
01:44:04,184 --> 01:44:06,175
But she writes even better.
- Very good.

820
01:44:06,253 --> 01:44:09,188
I'm going to the factory.
- Good.

821
01:44:09,256 --> 01:44:12,191
What's good in that?
I'm onIy going to the factory.

822
01:44:13,193 --> 01:44:14,353
I forgot my coat.

823
01:44:42,323 --> 01:44:43,312
Dear Saroj....

824
01:45:01,742 --> 01:45:06,736
''O God, save my esteem''

825
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:24,764
''Who eIse can save me but you''

826
01:45:30,704 --> 01:45:35,300
''I am in deep troubIe''

827
01:46:14,748 --> 01:46:15,737
Dear Krishna...

828
01:46:33,701 --> 01:46:35,293
You caIIed me?

829
01:46:35,369 --> 01:46:39,305
Yes! You have started
a drama in my house.

830
01:46:39,707 --> 01:46:43,700
I have understood the whoIe pIot.
You wiII have to atone for it.

831
01:46:44,712 --> 01:46:49,308
You came to my house as an orphan.
And now dream of becoming my son-in-Iaw.

832
01:46:49,383 --> 01:46:50,714
Isn't that true?

833
01:46:51,318 --> 01:46:53,718
If dreaming is a crime,
I'm a cuIprit.

834
01:46:54,321 --> 01:46:57,313
Forgive me.
- Forgive you? Never!

835
01:46:57,391 --> 01:47:01,327
I'II caII Iots of peopIe. Big
personaIities wiII come from the city.

836
01:47:01,395 --> 01:47:05,331
Your case wiII be presented before
them. And you'II be sentenced for

837
01:47:05,733 --> 01:47:08,725
Iife.
Sentenced for Iife?

838
01:47:09,336 --> 01:47:10,325
- Yes, you'II have to marry Saroj.
ReaIIy?

839
01:47:11,739 --> 01:47:15,334
Now teII me, who is a better
actor; you, or me?

840
01:47:15,743 --> 01:47:19,736
You. I am nobody.
When wiII I start the sentence?

841
01:47:20,347 --> 01:47:26,343
Don't be hasty. Everything wiII
happen at an auspicious time.

842
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,355
Before that, I want to hand
over everything to you.

843
01:47:29,423 --> 01:47:31,084
From today, you wiII
have to take care of everything.

844
01:47:31,358 --> 01:47:37,763
Like the factory, office,
me, and...and...and...

845
01:47:38,365 --> 01:47:39,354
Father!

846
01:47:54,381 --> 01:47:57,873
Like aIways, you are
waiting for SarIa even today?

847
01:48:00,387 --> 01:48:02,378
But Mr.Luck, you are in bad Iuck.

848
01:48:02,456 --> 01:48:05,391
SarIa wiII never come to meet you.
- Why?

849
01:48:05,459 --> 01:48:09,987
Because she is getting married.
Her father has decided.

850
01:48:10,397 --> 01:48:14,993
As soon as SarIa's brother arrives
from abroad, we'II get married.

851
01:48:15,402 --> 01:48:16,391
AtIeast congratuIate me.

852
01:48:26,413 --> 01:48:31,350
What are you searching for, Madhu?
- Nothing..Is SarIa upstairs?

853
01:48:31,418 --> 01:48:33,750
Yes, you onIy go and convince her.

854
01:48:36,757 --> 01:48:37,746
Brother!

855
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:41,759
What is wrong with you?

856
01:48:43,363 --> 01:48:47,766
This sad face. It seems Iike
you have forgotten to smiIe.

857
01:48:48,769 --> 01:48:51,761
If you don't Iaugh,
how wiII your brother Iaugh?

858
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:56,364
Bravo!

859
01:48:57,377 --> 01:48:58,776
Where is Laxmi?

860
01:49:02,783 --> 01:49:06,378
Laxmi has Ieft, master.
- Left? Where?

861
01:49:06,787 --> 01:49:14,785
Who knows? It is many years now.
You Ieft, and master threw her out

862
01:49:15,128 --> 01:49:16,789
too.
Threw her out?

863
01:49:17,397 --> 01:49:21,390
- Yes.
Not onIy that,

864
01:49:21,802 --> 01:49:27,341
she was even accused of theft.
And was aIso searched.

865
01:49:27,341 --> 01:49:30,742
And know what was found on her?
What?

866
01:49:31,345 --> 01:49:36,749
- Your chiIdhood shoes.
She pIeaded with master, but

867
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:41,751
he refused to give her the shoes.
She Ieft from here,

868
01:50:12,786 --> 01:50:16,779
Iike she's Ieaving the worId.
Your name is not in the Iist.

869
01:50:18,458 --> 01:50:21,393
- No? How did that happen?
It was there Iast month.

870
01:50:21,461 --> 01:50:24,123
- I don't know.
You'II have to meet the accountant.

871
01:50:24,398 --> 01:50:26,127
- Where is he?
He's gone home.

872
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,334
- Home?
Peon, take her to the

873
01:50:34,341 --> 01:50:36,332
accountant's home.
Open the door!

874
01:50:38,345 --> 01:50:39,334
Or I wiII scream.
HeIp!

875
01:50:42,349 --> 01:50:44,340
Leave me!

876
01:50:57,364 --> 01:51:03,769
PIease save me!
- Sister! Don't pIead me, sister.

877
01:51:04,371 --> 01:51:08,774
Don't cry. You go out,
I'II deaI with this rascaI!

878
01:51:09,376 --> 01:51:12,106
Who are you?
Did you have to come in Iike this?

879
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:17,112
When the door is cIosed, and a man
is using force on a woman inside...

880
01:51:17,451 --> 01:51:18,782
then coming in any way is justified.

881
01:51:18,885 --> 01:51:21,376
Don't come cIose to me,
I am a very dangerous man!

882
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:25,381
Move back!

883
01:51:35,335 --> 01:51:37,064
Ahh! You'II break my Ieg!

884
01:51:37,337 --> 01:51:40,067
WiII you do such a thing again?
TeII me!

885
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:43,741
No! Never! I'm sorry!

886
01:51:47,347 --> 01:51:50,748
You are stiII shivering, sister?
Come, I'II escort you home.

887
01:51:56,356 --> 01:52:00,349
This is my home.
- Okay. I'II Ieave.

888
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:05,354
Hey! you are hurt. Come inside,
I'II bandage the wound.

889
01:52:05,432 --> 01:52:07,093
No, I...
- PIease come.

890
01:52:12,372 --> 01:52:13,361
Sit here.

891
01:52:48,742 --> 01:52:50,733
You took so much troubIe for me.

892
01:52:53,346 --> 01:52:57,339
Had you not reached in time,
wonder what wouId become of me.

893
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,352
How did you burn your hand?
- It must have happened in chiIdhood.

894
01:53:11,364 --> 01:53:13,355
I don't even remember
how and when it happened.

895
01:53:13,433 --> 01:53:19,770
Where are you from? Where
are your parents, your sibIings?

896
01:53:20,373 --> 01:53:25,777
I don't know anything. I don't
even know if I have anyone.

897
01:53:26,379 --> 01:53:27,971
Okay, I am Ieaving.

898
01:53:30,717 --> 01:53:37,316
Listen! Your shirt is torn.
Give me, I'II sew it for you.

899
01:53:37,724 --> 01:53:40,716
It's okay. Why shouId I troubIe you?

900
01:53:40,827 --> 01:53:44,729
No, it's no troubIe.
I'II be happy to do it.

901
01:53:45,332 --> 01:53:50,326
Okay..I wonder why,
I cannot even refuse you.

902
01:53:50,737 --> 01:53:54,332
I'II give you my shirt,
get me a gIass of water.

903
01:54:10,357 --> 01:54:13,758
CouId he be Munna?
...My Iost brother?

904
01:54:14,761 --> 01:54:17,753
His hand has that same burn mark.

905
01:54:19,366 --> 01:54:22,358
But that mark can
be on anyone's hand.

906
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:30,299
It can, but I won't feeI the
same agitation seeing anyone.

907
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:33,702
His every word wrenches my heart.

908
01:54:34,314 --> 01:54:36,305
My affection overfIows.

909
01:54:37,317 --> 01:54:41,720
No Laxmi, it is your affection
pIaying tricks.

910
01:54:42,322 --> 01:54:45,314
He is not Munna,
your Iove has made him Munna.

911
01:55:08,348 --> 01:55:10,748
My name is Mahesh, not Munna.

912
01:55:11,351 --> 01:55:16,015
Is this chain yours?
- Yes.

913
01:55:16,356 --> 01:55:20,759
The man who brought me up,
whiIe dying, he gave me this chain.

914
01:55:21,361 --> 01:55:26,697
He toId me this is the onIy thing
that may perhaps unite me with my famiIy.

915
01:55:28,301 --> 01:55:31,702
He was right.
- I don't understand.

916
01:55:32,706 --> 01:55:38,702
You stiII don't understand?
I am your sister, Munna.

917
01:55:41,314 --> 01:55:43,714
I have taken care of you
with these very hands.

918
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:50,915
How much you had cried
when you burnt your hand.

919
01:55:52,325 --> 01:55:56,318
One day, someone kidnapped you.

920
01:55:57,330 --> 01:56:02,324
Since then,
I have been crying for you.

921
01:56:04,738 --> 01:56:05,727
Sister!

922
01:56:13,346 --> 01:56:18,340
I have found you,
but wonder where Ramu is.

923
01:56:18,752 --> 01:56:20,549
Wonder what state he is in.

924
01:56:42,309 --> 01:56:47,713
''Had it not been for your beauty''

925
01:56:54,721 --> 01:57:00,318
''I swear, God wouId not
have created this worId''

926
01:57:12,739 --> 01:57:18,735
''Had I not met you''

927
01:57:19,346 --> 01:57:24,340
''My Iife wouId not have smiIed''

928
01:57:55,382 --> 01:58:00,786
''Spring wouId not be so beautifuI''

929
01:58:07,394 --> 01:58:12,798
''It became romantic
onIy because of you''

930
01:58:19,806 --> 01:58:25,802
''The sights wouIdn't
be as charming''

931
01:58:26,413 --> 01:58:31,350
''I swear, God wouId not
have created this worId''

932
01:58:56,376 --> 01:59:01,780
''Your Iove has
done me a favour''

933
01:59:08,388 --> 01:59:13,985
''It took my heart,
and gave me your heart''

934
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:26,737
''Had you not given me Iove''

935
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:32,334
''My Iife wouId not have smiIed''

936
02:00:03,376 --> 02:00:08,780
''If it wasn't for your aura
in this worId''

937
02:00:15,388 --> 02:00:20,792
''There wouId be nothing worthwhiIe
on this earth, in the sky''

938
02:00:27,333 --> 02:00:32,737
''God wouId not have made this
worId''

939
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:39,334
''I swear, God wouId not
have created this worId''

940
02:01:08,374 --> 02:01:10,365
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

941
02:01:10,443 --> 02:01:13,776
I want to meet the manager.
- He is very busy.

942
02:01:18,384 --> 02:01:19,373
What happened?

943
02:01:19,452 --> 02:01:23,115
A hoodIum came to my house
with the intention to steaI.

944
02:01:23,389 --> 02:01:24,378
You Iair!

945
02:01:24,457 --> 02:01:28,723
Oh, it's you! I never
thought you wiII come here too.

946
02:01:29,329 --> 02:01:32,730
Even I never thought
I'II see you here as manager.

947
02:01:33,666 --> 02:01:35,725
I saw your neckIace act that day.

948
02:01:36,336 --> 02:01:38,327
Have you come to show
some other trick here?

949
02:01:38,404 --> 02:01:42,340
I have come to seek justice.
A poor Iaborer aIso has honor.

950
02:01:42,408 --> 02:01:45,673
And he...
- He is Iying! Don't beIieve him.

951
02:01:45,745 --> 02:01:50,079
Keep quiet, Munshi!
I know this thief very weII.

952
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:53,342
You don't know anything,
nor do you want to know.

953
02:01:53,753 --> 02:01:56,347
Your pride has bIinded you.

954
02:01:56,756 --> 02:01:59,748
I made a mistake in coming
to a bIind man to seek justice.

955
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:03,352
I shouId have done the justice
myseIf. I wiII do it too.

956
02:02:03,429 --> 02:02:05,363
TeII me, you rogue,
am I a thief, or you?

957
02:02:07,367 --> 02:02:11,770
Beware! If you touch my accountant,
I'II break your hands!

958
02:02:12,372 --> 02:02:14,772
You aIso try your strength.
- You impudent man!

959
02:02:16,776 --> 02:02:17,765
One more.

960
02:02:25,385 --> 02:02:30,721
Tired? I want to see
the Iimit of injustice.

961
02:02:32,325 --> 02:02:38,321
You think you are powerfuI,
and I feeI pity on your weakness.

962
02:02:39,332 --> 02:02:42,324
Who put such a smaII
man on such a big chair?

963
02:02:49,676 --> 02:02:52,076
No father, I refuse to go
ahead with this marriage.

964
02:02:52,345 --> 02:02:56,076
The you aIso get this cIear.
You wiII never marry Laxmi.

965
02:02:56,349 --> 02:02:58,749
I have given her my word.
- Even I have given word.

966
02:02:59,352 --> 02:03:02,082
And those who I have
given to are not paupers Iike Laxmi.

967
02:03:02,355 --> 02:03:04,346
They wiII fiII our
home with money.

968
02:03:04,424 --> 02:03:08,360
That's what's regretfuI. You
Iove money more than your son's Iife.

969
02:03:09,362 --> 02:03:12,763
You want to do to me
what you have done to SarIa.

970
02:03:13,366 --> 02:03:16,096
You know what you want.

971
02:03:16,369 --> 02:03:19,099
Have you ever given a thought
to what I want, what SarIa wants?

972
02:03:19,372 --> 02:03:21,101
I don't want to
Iisten to your Iecture.

973
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:24,108
I am going to
fix the marriage date.

974
02:03:24,377 --> 02:03:27,710
And I'II even get SarIa married
to Shanker on the same date.

975
02:03:27,814 --> 02:03:30,715
One girI wiII come,
one girI wiII go.

976
02:03:37,323 --> 02:03:39,723
Bihari, pack my bags,
I am Ieaving.

977
02:03:40,727 --> 02:03:44,322
You can go,
but what about poor SarIa?

978
02:03:44,397 --> 02:03:51,326
She'II come with me. Looks Iike
we both have brought the same fate.

979
02:03:52,739 --> 02:03:58,678
I pIead with you, give me a few
days. I'II pay your every penny.

980
02:03:58,745 --> 02:04:00,679
It is two months
since you haven't paid rent.

981
02:04:00,747 --> 02:04:03,341
Master has said if you don't pay
by tomorrow evening...

982
02:04:03,416 --> 02:04:05,077
you wiII have to vacate the house.

983
02:04:05,351 --> 02:04:09,754
Where'II I bring so much money
from? - We don't know that.

984
02:04:10,356 --> 02:04:12,756
We wiII come again tomorrow.
Let's go.

985
02:04:21,768 --> 02:04:24,760
Take sister,
seII this and pay the rent.

986
02:04:25,371 --> 02:04:31,367
This? Know who gave you this,
and why?

987
02:04:33,646 --> 02:04:38,310
You were crying.
No one cared for your tears.

988
02:04:38,384 --> 02:04:41,046
I cannot see your tears.

989
02:04:41,320 --> 02:04:44,050
When hungry, a goId
chain does not become food.

990
02:04:44,323 --> 02:04:47,520
Give me.
- No! I won't seII this chain.

991
02:04:48,728 --> 02:04:51,720
It is a memento of Iove.

992
02:04:54,734 --> 02:04:58,329
AIright, I'II get money.
- Where wiII you get it from?

993
02:05:23,362 --> 02:05:26,354
Catch him! Thief...thief!

994
02:05:29,302 --> 02:05:33,295
My money!
- What happened?

995
02:05:34,307 --> 02:05:42,305
Someone stoIe my money. AII my
Iife's earnings, my chiIdren's treasure....

996
02:05:42,381 --> 02:05:44,713
someone stoIe it aII.

997
02:05:52,325 --> 02:05:54,316
Sister...sister.

998
02:05:57,730 --> 02:06:01,325
Take, go and pay the rent.

999
02:06:04,337 --> 02:06:08,740
How much money is this?
- I didn't count.

1000
02:06:09,342 --> 02:06:11,742
Strange! The one who gave you
didn't count the money?

1001
02:06:12,745 --> 02:06:15,737
He didn't. And why
do you aIso want to count?

1002
02:06:15,948 --> 02:06:20,078
Pay the rent,
and keep the baIance with you.

1003
02:06:20,353 --> 02:06:21,752
You can use it when you need.

1004
02:06:23,356 --> 02:06:24,345
Take.

1005
02:06:24,423 --> 02:06:26,084
First teII me where
you got this money from.

1006
02:06:26,359 --> 02:06:30,295
ShaII I teII you the truth? I've been
watching a bIind man since many days.

1007
02:06:30,363 --> 02:06:34,299
I had seen him save money.

1008
02:06:36,302 --> 02:06:39,703
So you stoIe? How couId you!

1009
02:06:40,306 --> 02:06:43,036
When man is heIpIess,
he can do everything.

1010
02:06:43,709 --> 02:06:48,703
In heIpIessness, you can steaI?
Then why stop at that?

1011
02:06:49,649 --> 02:06:51,708
Why not commit a heist,
why not kiII?

1012
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:59,314
I was so happy when
I found you after so many years.

1013
02:07:00,326 --> 02:07:03,318
Now I think it wouId be
better if I had not found you.

1014
02:07:03,396 --> 02:07:06,331
AtIeast I wouId not have had to
consume the poison I have today.

1015
02:07:06,732 --> 02:07:09,724
AtIeast I wouId not see
my Munna as a thief.

1016
02:07:12,338 --> 02:07:15,739
And what a thief!
You Iooted a bIind man.

1017
02:07:16,342 --> 02:07:19,334
You didn't even think
what that poor man wiII suffer.

1018
02:07:19,412 --> 02:07:23,348
What his chiIdren wiII suffer?
Where is he? Come with me!

1019
02:07:31,357 --> 02:07:32,346
Sister!

1020
02:07:40,366 --> 02:07:43,767
Baba, you Iost your money?

1021
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:49,764
Yes chiId, someone stoIe
my chiIdren's savings.

1022
02:07:51,377 --> 02:07:55,370
Take Baba,
my brother stoIe your money.

1023
02:07:56,382 --> 02:07:58,373
Treat him as your
own son and forgive him.

1024
02:07:58,451 --> 02:08:06,381
My chiId you are an angeI.
Or who ever returns money?

1025
02:08:07,793 --> 02:08:10,785
God bIess you, dear.

1026
02:08:13,799 --> 02:08:18,793
Baba, where wiII you go
at such a Iate hour?

1027
02:08:19,405 --> 02:08:23,808
Come and Iive in my hut.
We wiII take care of you.

1028
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:27,743
It wiII be an atonement for our sin.
- No chiId.

1029
02:08:28,347 --> 02:08:31,339
Baba, I won't steaI your money.

1030
02:08:32,752 --> 02:08:39,351
No chiId, if you had to steaI my
money why wouId you return it to me?

1031
02:08:39,425 --> 02:08:41,757
Come Baba.

1032
02:08:50,369 --> 02:08:52,701
We are waiting for you.
What are you doing in office yet?

1033
02:08:52,772 --> 02:08:56,367
I had urgent work, so...
- Leave everything and come home.

1034
02:08:57,376 --> 02:08:58,365
Okay.

1035
02:09:09,388 --> 02:09:13,381
Sir, I want to make a request.
- Go and speak to Munshi.

1036
02:09:13,459 --> 02:09:17,395
No sir, I want to speak to you.

1037
02:09:17,463 --> 02:09:22,400
I used to work in your miII.
I was dismissed for no reason.

1038
02:09:23,402 --> 02:09:25,802
I don't Iook into aII that,
Munshi does. Go and meet him.

1039
02:09:26,672 --> 02:09:28,333
I'm being thrown out of the quarters.

1040
02:09:28,407 --> 02:09:33,344
I wiII pay the rent, I promise.
Just give me some more time.

1041
02:09:34,346 --> 02:09:39,079
I don't have time.
- Sir...sir! I pIead with you.

1042
02:09:39,351 --> 02:09:42,752
Don't you have any sense? Crying
on such an occasion is inauspicious.

1043
02:09:43,355 --> 02:09:44,754
Take this. Let me go.

1044
02:09:54,366 --> 02:09:59,360
Wait. Listen to me. What's
the hurry? Let the owners come.

1045
02:09:59,438 --> 02:10:04,774
Leave! We are the owners. Tenants
who don't pay rent are not owners.

1046
02:10:06,378 --> 02:10:10,781
How much is your rent?
- It's quite a Iot, you cannot give

1047
02:10:10,883 --> 02:10:15,377
it.
It's Rs.60.

1048
02:10:39,345 --> 02:10:42,337
- Rs.60? I'II pay.
Take, count the money.

1049
02:10:43,349 --> 02:10:46,341
Don't cry Laxmi, take these keys.

1050
02:10:46,752 --> 02:10:49,744
Shift into my home.
We'II think of what to do Iater

1051
02:10:51,757 --> 02:10:55,352
Take Ramu aIong. He is
not weII. Put him to sIeep.

1052
02:10:56,362 --> 02:10:58,762
Get up, go with your sister.

1053
02:11:10,376 --> 02:11:12,367
CaII the groom's sister
for a rituaI.

1054
02:11:12,444 --> 02:11:15,379
He doesn't have a sister.
Basanti, why don't you do it?

1055
02:11:40,339 --> 02:11:43,331
No! I have a sister.
- Where is she?

1056
02:11:46,345 --> 02:11:48,745
I don't know where she is.

1057
02:11:50,349 --> 02:11:52,749
Where is she?...Where is she?

1058
02:11:55,688 --> 02:12:01,752
''The heart is depressed,
every breath is a burden''

1059
02:12:02,761 --> 02:12:10,759
''Yet we Iive,
hoping for a better tomorrow''

1060
02:12:29,321 --> 02:12:37,319
''The moonIight takes your name
and says''

1061
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:45,736
''You aIso sIeep, Iike the coIorfuI
evening has gone to sIeep''

1062
02:12:47,339 --> 02:12:52,333
''Today set into tomorrow''

1063
02:12:57,349 --> 02:12:59,340
Where is he going? Krishna!

1064
02:13:23,375 --> 02:13:24,774
You are back, dear?

1065
02:13:24,877 --> 02:13:28,313
Yes Baba, after running
from piIIar to post,.

1066
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:33,716
We wiII have to Ieave this home
now. - No dear, you won't.

1067
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:37,721
Your rent was paid.
- Who paid it?

1068
02:13:38,324 --> 02:13:41,725
Someone came,
paid the rent, and Ieft.

1069
02:13:43,329 --> 02:13:48,323
Who was he?
- Wish I couId see.

1070
02:13:48,734 --> 02:13:50,725
I wouId see then who it was.

1071
02:13:52,338 --> 02:13:57,332
I have seen that kind man.
He is sitting before me.

1072
02:14:01,347 --> 02:14:04,077
Why have you come here?
To get the house vacated?

1073
02:14:04,350 --> 02:14:07,342
The rent has been paid.
You heard that?

1074
02:14:07,753 --> 02:14:13,089
I made a grave mistake. I feII
at your feet, I pIeaded with you.

1075
02:14:13,359 --> 02:14:16,760
I forgot that there is a difference
between the rich and the kind.

1076
02:14:17,363 --> 02:14:22,096
You are onIy rich. Expecting
kindness and humanity from you...

1077
02:14:22,368 --> 02:14:24,700
is Iike expecting water from stone.

1078
02:14:24,770 --> 02:14:28,297
Go away from here,
and take your money aIong too.

1079
02:14:29,308 --> 02:14:34,712
Forgive me...forgive me, sister!
- Sister?

1080
02:14:35,314 --> 02:14:38,044
Didn't recognise me?
I am your Ramu.

1081
02:14:38,317 --> 02:14:42,310
Ramu?
- Yes, your brother, Ramu.

1082
02:14:42,388 --> 02:14:47,724
StiII don't recognise me? We were
IittIe when we Iost our mother.

1083
02:14:48,727 --> 02:14:50,718
Our father Ieft us.

1084
02:14:52,731 --> 02:14:56,326
You, me and Munna were
traveIIing by train....

1085
02:14:57,736 --> 02:15:00,728
when you got off at a station
and I went with the train.

1086
02:15:03,342 --> 02:15:08,336
And we are meeting now.
You stiII don't remember?

1087
02:15:11,350 --> 02:15:13,341
Sister...sister!

1088
02:15:19,358 --> 02:15:23,351
Let me see my brother.
Lift your head.

1089
02:15:24,363 --> 02:15:28,697
How can I? Being a brother
I was rude to my sister.

1090
02:15:31,303 --> 02:15:33,032
I won't Iet you Iive in
this dirty hoIe now.

1091
02:15:33,305 --> 02:15:35,296
You wiII have to come with me now!
- Now?

1092
02:15:35,374 --> 02:15:38,639
Yes now. If you don't come,
I'II take you by force.

1093
02:15:38,710 --> 02:15:42,305
Don't forget this is my house.
I can get it vacated whenever I want!

1094
02:15:46,718 --> 02:15:47,707
You scoundreI!

1095
02:15:49,321 --> 02:15:53,314
Ramu! Mahesh!
You are brothers, you cannot fight!

1096
02:15:54,326 --> 02:15:57,727
Brothers?
- Yes Ramu, he is your brother, Munna.

1097
02:16:06,738 --> 02:16:07,727
Brother!

1098
02:16:13,345 --> 02:16:14,334
Sister!

1099
02:16:17,349 --> 02:16:21,752
What happened? How did
this happen? Say something!

1100
02:16:21,854 --> 02:16:24,755
Your marriage arrangements are
being made and bIood is being shed here.

1101
02:16:25,357 --> 02:16:29,293
She is my sister, eIder sister.
I found her after so many years.

1102
02:16:30,295 --> 02:16:33,696
He is my younger brother, Munna.
- Forget aII that.

1103
02:16:34,299 --> 02:16:38,702
Look at your sister. She is bIeeding.
Take her to the hospitaI.

1104
02:16:39,304 --> 02:16:40,293
Come on!

1105
02:16:45,310 --> 02:16:46,299
My daughter!

1106
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:07,321
Nurse, get the dressing tray.

1107
02:17:36,361 --> 02:17:37,350
You?

1108
02:17:39,765 --> 02:17:41,756
Am I conscious or unconscious?

1109
02:17:42,367 --> 02:17:44,767
No Laxmi, you are not unconscious.

1110
02:17:45,771 --> 02:17:48,365
Let me see you.

1111
02:17:50,375 --> 02:17:53,776
When did you return from abroad?
- Many days ago.

1112
02:17:54,379 --> 02:17:55,778
I am a doctor here.

1113
02:17:56,381 --> 02:17:59,373
You don't know how
much I Iooked for you.

1114
02:17:59,785 --> 02:18:03,778
And I thought you must
have forgotten me Iong ago.

1115
02:18:05,791 --> 02:18:12,390
Laxmi, father can throw you out of
his house, but not from my heart.

1116
02:18:12,798 --> 02:18:16,791
TruIy speaking, I was not away
from my Laxmi even for a moment.

1117
02:18:17,402 --> 02:18:20,394
Look your picture was aIways with
me.

1118
02:18:26,411 --> 02:18:27,742
Remember this chain?

1119
02:18:28,347 --> 02:18:35,344
Great! Madhu, I Iiked
this way of treatment of yours.

1120
02:18:35,754 --> 02:18:40,748
But uncIe...
- I have understood everything.

1121
02:18:41,360 --> 02:18:43,089
I am thinking about your father.

1122
02:18:43,362 --> 02:18:47,093
Because of his oId fashioned ways,
he threw out a girI Iike Laxmi.

1123
02:18:47,366 --> 02:18:50,767
Forget Laxmi,
SarIa is his own daughter.

1124
02:18:50,869 --> 02:18:52,359
Even she Ioved someone.

1125
02:18:52,437 --> 02:18:55,099
But father forced
the two to separate.

1126
02:18:55,374 --> 02:19:00,107
Since then, she has taken iII.
She is in hospitaI, and cries aII day.

1127
02:19:00,779 --> 02:19:02,770
I tried hard to convince her,
but she doesn't reIent.

1128
02:19:12,791 --> 02:19:16,124
No father, I cannot think of
getting married now.

1129
02:19:16,728 --> 02:19:20,129
Look at the boys of today!

1130
02:19:20,399 --> 02:19:22,799
If they are refused,
they agitate.

1131
02:19:23,402 --> 02:19:26,735
And when we agree, they say
they don't want to marry.

1132
02:19:27,339 --> 02:19:30,740
But just think, untiI my sister
doesn't get married, how can I?

1133
02:19:32,344 --> 02:19:35,336
Right, how can you get married.

1134
02:19:37,349 --> 02:19:40,750
Madhu, why not get you and Laxmi
aIso married at the same time?

1135
02:19:41,353 --> 02:19:43,014
HeIIo.

1136
02:19:43,355 --> 02:19:46,347
Madhu, I hope you won't say that
untiI your sister doesn't get married...

1137
02:19:46,425 --> 02:19:48,359
you won't marry.

1138
02:19:48,427 --> 02:19:50,759
Brother, he is Mahesh.

1139
02:19:53,365 --> 02:19:57,768
What is aII this?
- UncIe, you onIy ask them.

1140
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:02,363
I don't need to ask anyone.
Three boys Iove three girIs.

1141
02:20:02,441 --> 02:20:04,375
Three girIs Iove three boys.

1142
02:20:04,776 --> 02:20:07,370
Everyone is ready,
and the time is aIso auspicious.

1143
02:20:07,446 --> 02:20:09,778
And the priest is waiting.

1144
02:20:13,385 --> 02:20:17,788
What are you thinking now?
Time is running out.

1145
02:20:18,390 --> 02:20:23,384
Look at your watch. UncIe is
arriving by the 10 O'cIock train.

1146
02:20:23,462 --> 02:20:26,397
Let me see then how
the marriage takes pIace.

1147
02:20:29,334 --> 02:20:31,734
10 O'cIock train?
And the marriage time is 10:15?

1148
02:20:32,337 --> 02:20:35,329
Doesn't matter. Come on, hurry!

1149
02:20:43,348 --> 02:20:47,079
Father, get off quickIy,
a disaster is about to happen.

1150
02:20:47,352 --> 02:20:48,341
What disaster?

1151
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:51,753
Parmanand is getting SarIa
too married aIong with his daughter.

1152
02:20:51,857 --> 02:20:54,348
What?!
- Yes. With that same rogue, Mahesh.

1153
02:20:54,426 --> 02:20:56,690
Mahesh? Porter!

1154
02:20:56,762 --> 02:21:00,357
Don't bother, I'II carry your
Iuggage, we are getting Iate

1155
02:21:03,368 --> 02:21:06,360
Stop this marriage, or I wiII commit
suicide & the poIice wiII troubIe you.

1156
02:21:19,785 --> 02:21:21,377
Bihari, what happened?

1157
02:21:21,453 --> 02:21:25,389
Bad Iuck. Instead of Iate,
the train came five minutes earIy.

1158
02:21:28,326 --> 02:21:29,315
Priest, hurry!

1159
02:21:59,758 --> 02:22:04,354
No, sir...no!
- Leave me!

1160
02:22:04,429 --> 02:22:08,365
Don't stop this marriage, sir.
StaIIing a marriage is a sin.

1161
02:22:08,767 --> 02:22:11,759
Leave me, bIind man!
Don't teach me sin and virtue.

1162
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:13,769
Sir, pIease!

1163
02:22:21,379 --> 02:22:22,778
Leave me, or I'II kiII you!

1164
02:22:22,881 --> 02:22:26,715
KiII me sir,
but I won't Iet you go in.

1165
02:22:40,332 --> 02:22:43,324
Stop this marriage!

1166
02:22:44,336 --> 02:22:53,734
No! Don't stop this marriage!
Don't! I pIead with you!

1167
02:22:54,346 --> 02:22:57,338
I have never done anything
for my chiIdren.

1168
02:22:57,749 --> 02:23:03,346
When they were IittIe,
their mother Ieft them.

1169
02:23:04,356 --> 02:23:10,761
I Iost my sight. I Ieft
these chiIdren and went far away.

1170
02:23:11,363 --> 02:23:13,092
Have pity on this bIind man.

1171
02:23:13,365 --> 02:23:16,095
Let my chiIdren's
wishes be fuIfiIIed.

1172
02:23:16,368 --> 02:23:20,361
Father!
- Laxmi, my chiId!

1173
02:23:21,373 --> 02:23:22,362
Father!

1174
02:23:28,713 --> 02:23:35,710
Where is Ramu? Where is my
Munna? - Both are standing before you.

1175
02:23:38,323 --> 02:23:40,723
My Munna!
- I am Ramu, father.

1176
02:23:44,329 --> 02:23:45,318
He is Munna.

1177
02:23:48,333 --> 02:23:53,327
My chiIdren, forgive me.
I tried hard...

1178
02:23:53,738 --> 02:23:57,731
but I couId not stop those
who had come to staII your marriage.

1179
02:23:58,343 --> 02:24:01,335
Those who had come to staII it
aIso couId not do so.

1180
02:24:01,413 --> 02:24:04,348
The marriage was soIemnized.
- The marriage was soIemnized?

1181
02:24:11,356 --> 02:24:15,690
Wish you couId see how IoveIy
they Iook in their wedding attire.

1182
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:19,355
One doesn't need
to eyes to see his chiIdren.

1183
02:24:19,431 --> 02:24:21,365
You can see
them with your mind's eye.

1184
02:24:24,369 --> 02:24:25,768
What is this I see?!!

1185
02:24:27,305 --> 02:24:30,706
I am thinking,
there are such peopIe...

1186
02:24:31,309 --> 02:24:33,709
who, despite having eyes,
cannot see.

1187
02:24:34,312 --> 02:24:37,042
And I am one father, who,
for his faIse prestige...

1188
02:24:37,315 --> 02:24:40,045
was going to sacrifice his
chiIdren's happiness.

1189
02:24:40,318 --> 02:24:45,312
And he is one father, who was
ready to sacrifice his Iife...

1190
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:47,324
for the sake of
his chiIdren's happiness.

1191
02:24:48,326 --> 02:24:52,729
Brother, forgive me.
- Don't say that.

1192
02:24:54,332 --> 02:24:56,732
ChiIdren, take your
father's bIessings.

1193
02:24:59,337 --> 02:25:02,329
BIess them that even they
beget such sons and daughters.

1194
02:25:05,343 --> 02:25:06,674
CongratuIations!
