1
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:33,973
Who was he?

2
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:34,477
The same

3
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:35,983
Follow him

4
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:38,982
Daddy I'll be with his girl friend,
Ican get to know a lot about him

5
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,814
Alright, take care of yourself, go

6
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:24,858
Hallo who is it?

7
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,538
Early morning somebody is in a
mood jokes-

8
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,206
He says himself
to be Amar

9
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:34,037
Look, look, look.

10
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:37,037
He is one scowndrel who is
following me

11
00:03:37,746 --> 00:03:38,713
Ask him where is he speaking from?

12
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,207
Talk a little sweet

13
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:46,377
Hallo, who, Amar darling, where
are you speaking from?

14
00:03:46,922 --> 00:03:48,048
All this I'll
tell later-

15
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:50,383
First tell me, that last
night who was in your room?

16
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,220
In my room, no one

17
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,056
Look ourling, last night I
couldn't meet you-

18
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:58,391
And now I am again leaving to pune,
I am speaking from V. T station

19
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,897
In another 20 minutes
my train will leave

20
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:01,231
I called up to inform you
only this-

21
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:02,563
That last night there was
someone in your room-

22
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:04,898
I am scared, if the police
is chasing us

23
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:05,902
Just take care
of yourself-

24
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,074
The moment I reach pune,
I'll contact you

25
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,253
Now where will
you escape?

26
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,915
Brother, I... I... I
I am Vinay

27
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:27,090
Where are you going?

28
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,764
To catch Amar, that wicked,
the son of there's

29
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:30,756
Even you

30
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,263
Even you, how do you
know that he is in Pune.

31
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,093
In Pune

32
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:34,768
Yes,

33
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,096
But, first tell me that how did
you come to know of this?

34
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:38,936
Look at that rascals gut's, he again
wrote a letter to Shalu-

35
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,275
Telling her to come in this train
and meet me in Pune station-

36
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,443
And Shalu also
got ready-

37
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:43,778
I come to know
of it

38
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:44,604
I locked her in
the house-

39
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:45,438
And told her, dare
you go?

40
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:46,773
I'll go and
punish him-

41
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:49,610
Brother, we'll not have to go
till Pune-

42
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:50,614
Amar, is in this
train only

43
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:51,611
In this train

44
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,946
He is in this train and
going to Pune

45
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:53,954
But...

46
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:55,452
How did I get to know,
it's a long story

47
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:56,624
First let's catch him, later I'll tell you

48
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,793
It's good that all the compartments
of this train are joined-

49
00:04:58,994 --> 00:04:59,961
The entire train can be
searched off

50
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:00,786
This is really
very good-

51
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,793
Do one thing, you go that side,
I'll go this side

52
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:06,133
And look if you get him, inform me,
after that I'll take him to task.

53
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:07,468
Even you do the
same thing

54
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:08,135
Yes, yes, yes.

55
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,150
You didn't get him,
isn't it

56
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:25,649
Somebody has lied you, he is
not in

57
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,651
Not lied, but may be
he has changed his mind.

58
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:30,984
I am sure he will definitely come
to Pune station, to meet Shalu

59
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:31,988
Even I think the
same

60
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:37,828
Your estimation was
rightly-

61
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,996
Instead of Shaly, his brother
has come

62
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:41,327
It's good that you came

63
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,437
Otherwise, he'll start the
fight again unneccessarily

64
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:45,004
And we should leave
from here immediately

65
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:51,108
Yesterday you were
wearing the same coat?

66
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,812
Yes... Yes... absolutely the same

67
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:55,675
Oh... Come...

68
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:23,410
Prince! Sweet drink!

69
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:36,952
Prince! What you had written
in the letter has come true

70
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:39,226
And Mr. Radha has reached Calcutta-

71
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:42,528
And he wants to see
the jewellery worth 80 lakhs

72
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:44,390
Prince!

73
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,430
As instructed by you. We have
printed your visiting cards

74
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,335
He is from france,
representing a famous jewaller-

75
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:54,734
And he is here to buy diamonds
and jewellery from India

76
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:00,103
From all the corners of the world
buyers have reached Calcutta

77
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:05,146
But this word has been
put into Mr. Rana's ears-

78
00:07:05,553 --> 00:07:07,248
That if you like
the jewellery,

79
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:11,419
You are carrying 80 lakhs
cheque in your pocket

80
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,986
Your new dresses are stitched
with latest French fashion

81
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,695
As written by you

82
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,594
Mr. Rana is a flirt

83
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,433
Wonderful Prince! You have
again hit the bull's eye!

84
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:25,502
In two meetings he has
been charmed by Julie!

85
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:34,941
First, he was going on
interviewing, modern girls!

86
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,217
Now, he says...

87
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,079
If anyone is going to wear
my jewellery. It will be julie!

88
00:07:40,822 --> 00:07:41,948
So, Prince...

89
00:07:42,323 --> 00:07:45,190
Are we going to kidnap Julie
by our selves from the hall

90
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,320
I will think...
I will think...

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,595
You all may leave now,
and let Prince take some rest

92
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:08,240
Darling, I suspect that
I am pregnant

93
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:10,245
This is happy news!

94
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:13,314
Then, when are you
going to marry me?

95
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,488
As soon as I get a chance...

96
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:23,520
Poor Mr. Rana, how restlessly,
he must be waiting?

97
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:25,152
What happened?

98
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:27,116
I am ruined, I am ruined!

99
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:28,887
Why will I
do like this?

100
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,052
Oh! Jagga!

101
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:37,456
Girl with 80 lakhs

00:11:23,878 --> 00:11:25,903
Why don't you show
your face and then go.

00:11:44,165 --> 00:11:45,655
Vinay... stop... Vinay

108
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,195
Elder brother, is it you?

109
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:49,664
What did you do?
Why are they chasing you?

110
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:50,700
What are you doing sir?

111
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,052
I thought they
would have killed you.

112
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:09,954
I don't know what has
happened to all of them?

113
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,818
What has happened? Didn't you
see today's newspaper?

114
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:13,355
Every newspaper has printed
Amar's photograph!

115
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,391
Yesterday night he has
committed a big robbery

116
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:16,324
Look at this...

117
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:17,655
How identical his face
is with yours!

118
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,122
Brother! It's me!

119
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:20,000
You!

120
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,226
They think thatl am Amar, and
made me to commit the robbery

121
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:23,399
You are talking of which time?

122
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:24,228
Yesterday night!

123
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,236
What has happened to you? You
were with me the whole night

124
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:27,303
Aey, me...

125
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:28,637
Are you drunk?

126
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:31,035
We had seen the 9:30 show
together last night

127
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,303
After that, we went
to hotel and slept.

128
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:33,070
About whom are you talking?

129
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,075
After Poona's train, I am
meeting you for the first time

130
00:12:35,283 --> 00:12:36,250
Vinay, What's wrong
with you

131
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,850
We have come to-gether
from Poona to Calcutta.

132
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:39,075
Booked a double room
in the hotel, -

133
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:41,184
We were not seperated
even for a moment.

134
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,689
In the morning, upto
what time I was with you?

135
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:46,253
You were sleeping
when I left, Why?

136
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,189
Drive immediately.

137
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:48,688
Arey I should also Know
what's the problem?

138
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,364
Because, the person with whom
you spent 2 days, he is Amar

139
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:51,661
Amar! Amar!!

140
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:52,763
Driver quickly.

141
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:55,264
Drive immediatly,
he has once again deceived me-

142
00:12:56,804 --> 00:12:58,237
You, cheat!

143
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:02,174
Amar! He is not here

144
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:03,434
How will I know
his where abouts. Look there.

145
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:04,133
What is this?

146
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:06,013
Looks like, it will be
in the letter!

147
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,140
This is the paper from his pad

148
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,313
Read what is written?

149
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:13,211
You think, you are very clever?
But you are a fool Amar.

150
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:15,450
How dare?

151
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:16,849
You think, you are very clever

152
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:19,822
I am a fool, I will wring
the neck of that rascal

153
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,054
Come, we will ask the
manager; he might know

154
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,691
I think it's him only

155
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:37,500
Julie!

156
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:40,473
Beware, don't come forward
, I will shoot you

157
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:41,976
Suddenly, what's
happened to you?

158
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,615
I have been deceived once-

159
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:45,514
That doesnt mean,
I will always be deceived

160
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,987
Deceived?
How were you deceived?

161
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:50,085
You are not our Prince Amar-

162
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:51,787
Your name is Vinay.

163
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:53,993
Vinay! Who told you that?

164
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:54,923
Don't try to act smart.

165
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:56,255
Now I, know every thing.

166
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,694
You made a fool of me,
you made a fool of my friends.

167
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:02,664
The theft that Amar was to
have committed, you did it.

168
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:04,664
Tell me where are those 80 lakhs
worth of jewels.

169
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:06,203
Otherwise you won't be spared.

170
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,142
Tell me, who told you all this?

171
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:12,812
I won't tell.

172
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:13,742
Tell me, who is that?

173
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:15,346
Leave me, I will tell you.

174
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,049
Tell me quickly.

175
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:18,309
I saw it with my own eyes.

176
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:18,848
What did you see?

177
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:21,478
Both of them
Amar and Vinay.

178
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:23,221
Where did you see Amar?

179
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,719
He was also with me.

180
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:27,394
And he told me that you are
impersonating him.

181
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:28,595
And he also told me, -

182
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,388
That I should catch you.

183
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:31,359
Where is he now?

184
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:32,191
He has gone

185
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,025
Where has he gone?

186
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,098
Gangtok, Sikkim.

187
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:35,269
Did you see?

188
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:37,862
You were always cursing him.

189
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:39,504
To-day that son
has stood in good stead

190
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:41,538
Now you understood?

191
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:43,877
Why I wanted him
to join the police force.

192
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,113
He has my blood in his veins

193
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,745
Darling!
Where is this Gangtok?

194
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,752
In Sikkim.

195
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:54,685
The thief is very clever.

196
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:58,323
He knows that our police
can't do anything there.

197
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,921
But how I will pressurize
that govt. Through our govt,

198
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:04,788
That they should help us.

199
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,242
Anyway

200
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:25,985
There the swimming pool
is very beautiful-

201
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,084
I will take you there.

202
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:30,523
That is north hill hotel and
it is the best hotel of Gangtok.

203
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:31,623
It's a very beautiful city.

204
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,589
I will write to shalu and ask
her to come with daddy.

205
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:35,956
Yes, as it is she will be
coming in a few days.

206
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,155
Is in't daddy's jeep.

207
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:58,280
How are you son?

208
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:01,719
He is my son Vinay.

209
00:16:02,423 --> 00:16:04,288
You look at him
and understand-

210
00:16:04,492 --> 00:16:05,390
As to what type of a person
are we looking for?

211
00:16:10,498 --> 00:16:13,331
Brother has shown me all the
places, which he used to visit.

212
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,490
Had I not seen your feet
even I would have been deveived.

213
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,350
Has anybody told you before
that how beautiful you are.

214
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:09,418
Has anybody told you before that
you are more handsome than him.

215
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:13,685
With Amer!

216
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,360
His hair has started greying here.

217
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:20,667
And wrinkles have
appeared here.

218
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,368
What's your name?

219
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,307
If any body sees then,

220
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:30,068
You will be in trouble yourself,
and put me in trouble too.

221
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:31,503
Then let's go some where else.

222
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,202
If he comes to know then...

223
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:35,080
You are so scared of him?

224
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,510
Till I am in his clutches
I have to be scared.

225
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,220
But once I extricate myself,
I will be free for ever

226
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:45,892
What is your relationship
with him?

227
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:49,421
He is an expert in
making false promises

228
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,857
But once he can grab a girl,

229
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,791
Then he makes her dance to his tunes.

230
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:54,524
Really?

231
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:56,327
Every girl thinks
that he will marry her.

232
00:17:56,837 --> 00:17:58,566
But I have become wiser

233
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,074
At the first opportunity
I will disappear.

234
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:03,574
Where will you go?

235
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:06,272
Delhi, Bombay
wherever I wish...

236
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:08,138
Will you come with me?

237
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:09,413
Really?

238
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:13,845
Go away. You want me to do
something under false pretexts.

239
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:17,516
Yes, there is some work
if you wish to do it.

240
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,454
Once, I want to meet him.

241
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,523
Why do you want to put
your life in danger?

242
00:18:24,398 --> 00:18:28,391
Think it over, you do
my work, I will do your work.

243
00:18:28,936 --> 00:18:31,928
Okay listen! He comes to
my house in the night.

244
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:34,035
Where is your house?

245
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,978
Oh God! He is Amar's man,
he is looking for me.

246
00:19:29,396 --> 00:19:30,328
Shalu.

247
00:20:01,228 --> 00:20:03,662
You probably thought I am Amar,
that's why you were running away.

248
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,994
I want you to go away
don't follow me like this.

249
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:10,094
Why are you scared?

250
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:15,434
If brother comes to know
he will be very angry.

251
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:11,395
If someone sees then.

252
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:18,040
Your brother was saying-

253
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,542
That you were going to come
after 3-4 days.

254
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:21,408
I have come just now,
I haven't met him.

255
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:23,844
He wasn't at home
He doesn't even know.

256
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:25,214
I will go.

257
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:26,547
You are a strange girl.

258
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,388
I have come to your city-

259
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,284
You don't have the courtesy of
offering me a cup of tea

260
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:31,150
Why don't you understand?

261
00:20:33,594 --> 00:20:35,391
It's not proper for us
to be seen to-gather

262
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:36,659
Go away Vinay.

263
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:40,798
They are all excuses
there is something behind it.

264
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:41,501
There is nothing.

265
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:42,066
Tell me

266
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:43,201
I tell you there is nothing

267
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:43,733
I don't belive it.

268
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:44,233
You leave me.

269
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:44,894
You'll have to tell me

270
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:45,401
I won't tell.

271
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:47,539
If there is something
only I can tell you.

272
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:48,933
You are unnecessarily
troubling me.

273
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:50,701
Then, why did you run away
after seeing me?

274
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:53,079
If you ask me unnecessary
questions, I won't answer.

275
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,247
Brother has forbidden
you to meet me?

276
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:56,313
I won't answer.

277
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,215
Will you meet me again?

278
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,450
I don't know.

279
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:02,752
You don't like to meet me?

280
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,051
I will not answer.

281
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,057
Okay go.

282
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,731
We might not meet again.

283
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,899
You know, what a dangerous man
I am chasing.

284
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:17,301
Good Bye.

285
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,786
You won't hate me, is'nt it.

286
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:37,450
I thought I will love you...

287
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:41,585
No. Don't say like that
don't think like that.

288
00:21:44,598 --> 00:21:46,395
Shalu come with me
for a little while.

289
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,794
I promise you that I shall
not ask any such questions.

290
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,203
Which you may not wish to answer.

291
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:53,402
Make one more promise.

292
00:21:54,642 --> 00:21:56,610
That you will not
mention this to brother.

293
00:21:57,344 --> 00:21:57,935
Done.

294
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:01,946
Where do you wish to go?

295
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:02,975
Wherever you want to take me.

296
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:34,141
Actually brother it's all my fault

297
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,814
Shalu, said that she didn't
meet you till now.

298
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:38,511
I dragged her forcibily

299
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:40,583
Oh!

300
00:27:41,321 --> 00:27:42,652
Why are you getting scared
like this Shalu.

301
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:46,024
I haven't prevented to you
from anything till to-day.

302
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,792
If I had known that
whom are you going with-

303
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:51,789
And when are you going to return,
I wouldn't worry.

304
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:55,258
Actually Vinay, Shalu is
my only sister.

305
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:58,737
And you know, this poor thing
has been deceived once

306
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:02,840
Have faith in me,
I am not one of them.

307
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:04,574
Who break the betrothal,

308
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:08,975
If you give the blessings, I am prepared to
make her mine for ever.

309
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:14,316
Really! Wonderful.

310
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:19,858
If Shalu has the same intention,
then I would be very happy.

311
00:28:21,428 --> 00:28:22,156
You also come inside.

312
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:34,605
Vinay, Vinay. Not there
here, here.

313
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:37,869
I couldn't come to-day understood...

314
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,878
Hey stop.

315
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,046
Take me away from here.
He will kill me.

316
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:22,888
Who?

317
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:24,888
He came to know, all that
I had talked to you yesterday.

318
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:25,649
Who came to know?

319
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:27,357
Amar who else?

320
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,655
Come on Vinay I will tell you
everything on the way.

321
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:29,361
Amar!

322
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:31,128
Come Vinay please come.

323
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,593
You can drive the jeep, is'nt it?

324
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,391
Whose is this jeep?

325
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:38,265
It is his. What are you thinking
Vinay come soon there is no time

326
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:41,339
Come on.

327
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:45,211
We will go home for a minute,
you pick up your bag from there.

328
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:47,605
After that...
Go ahead and then right.

329
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:54,515
You wait in the jeep,
I will come just now.

330
00:30:04,831 --> 00:30:07,129
Amar what are you doing? Leave my hand.

331
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:28,312
; getting worried, that I have come to the enemy's

332
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:30,075
But here I found my own friends.,

333
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,748
There are more, come.

334
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:38,650
Gentleman, our guest has come.

335
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,126
Come, Come sir.

336
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:45,059
Mr. Rana.

337
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:47,233
You made us wait for a long time friend.

338
00:31:47,601 --> 00:31:48,727
At least he has come.

339
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:50,869
Come on Sir! Will you have a drink?

340
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:51,934
Taste this.

341
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:56,037
Taste it from my glass because
he has special affection for me.

342
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:00,404
He doesn't know me, but I know him very well-

343
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:01,410
That's why I will embrace him.

344
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:26,428
He has ordered that he (Vinay)
Should'nt have any problem.

345
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:29,075
He'll have no problem.

346
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:31,009
If you feel hungry, these are
the things to eat.

347
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:33,405
If you feel thirsty,
this is here to drink.

348
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:35,942
That means, I am a first class prisoner

349
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:39,878
Prisoner
no no. Don't utter
such a bad word.

350
00:32:40,553 --> 00:32:42,214
You are our special guest.

351
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:45,448
If you need anything,
we are at your service

352
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:48,761
For that purpose. This man will
be at your service for 24 hours.

353
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:24,319
Finished? I will drink more.
Any body here? Any body here?

354
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:25,155
What is it?

355
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,292
Bottle is empty
I will drink more-

356
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:30,332
I am your special guest, serve.

357
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:33,506
It's enough go and sleep.

358
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:37,108
I will drink more,
I will drink more.

359
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:02,086
Pick him up.

360
00:35:02,295 --> 00:35:05,093
He has drank a lot. Take him.

361
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:09,268
Keep it that side, It may go off.

362
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:17,133
He has drank too much.

363
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:17,969
He is not bothered about...

364
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:34,987
Come on friend... Come on...

365
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:36,648
Amar it is useless to hide now.
I know you are inside.

366
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,014
Come out.

367
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:40,855
Open the door otherwise...

368
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,078
You had promised that the day
Vinay reaches here.

369
00:37:33,313 --> 00:37:34,575
The same day you will
return my brother to me.

370
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:44,888
Sister! Where were you? -

371
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:47,616
They were not allowing me
to play or to go out

372
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:48,761
And you also left me.

373
00:37:50,463 --> 00:37:55,127
No., no Shishu, I will not go, I will
never leave you and go.

374
00:37:56,336 --> 00:38:00,432
Listen whoever has troubled you,
I will punish him severely-

375
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,470
You don't worry.

376
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,710
Sister let's go home.

377
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:06,611
Yes we'll go home,
I have come to take you.

378
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:07,609
Really!

379
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:18,449
What's all this?
Why are you closing the door?

380
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:20,726
I am telling you
to open the door.

381
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:23,485
Open the door-
open the door...

382
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:25,460
Don't you know.

383
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:27,098
Brother, gave the
permission to go.

384
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,626
Open the door otherwise
I will beat you to pulp...

385
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:37,542
Don't worry,
I will open the next door.

386
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,704
Vinay!

387
00:39:47,914 --> 00:39:49,438
Vinay are you listening

388
00:39:49,649 --> 00:39:50,115
Who is it?

389
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,374
I am Shalu.

390
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:51,949
Shalu.

391
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:53,851
Where are you
speaking from?

392
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:56,487
From under your room
there is a tunnel.

393
00:39:58,758 --> 00:39:59,952
How did you reach here?

394
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:02,220
If you remove the carpet of your bath room

395
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:04,453
You will find
the way to get down

396
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:07,900
Make fast!

397
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,864
Make fast I am waiting for you.

398
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:50,131
Shall we go!

399
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,046
Vinay, Vinay will you forgive me?

400
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:36,484
If you will ask for
forgiveness like this-

401
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:37,986
Then it will be difficult to refuse.

402
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:42,392
But I have not understood
so many things till how.

403
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:44,990
We will get lot of time to
understand and explain.

404
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:47,561
But if we are caught, now the
life of 3 of us will be in danger.

405
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,231
Who is third one?

406
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:51,031
Come there.

407
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:18,293
Sister! Come to me.

408
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:22,200
My brother, Shishu.

409
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:24,499
Once I had told
you is'nt it.

410
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:26,569
I am living for him.

411
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:29,533
And that brother of yours.

412
00:42:31,077 --> 00:42:32,567
He had kidnapped
this poor thing.

413
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:34,907
By threatning to kill him-

414
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:36,376
He forced me do, whatever he wished.

415
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,727
You know from the begining
itself that I am not Amar.

416
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,500
You haven't come to know till now.

417
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,533
That there is no person by the name of Amar.

418
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:06,768
Is there is no person by the name of Amar?

419
00:43:09,348 --> 00:43:10,747
There is no other person looking like me?

420
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,650
There is no other person looking like you.

421
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:19,090
You have been deceived.

422
00:43:21,127 --> 00:43:26,190
I, Helen, Julie and the rest of
them who work with that thief.

423
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:29,000
All of them combimned to-gather
and tried to prove.

424
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:34,202
That there is another person who looks like you.

425
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:35,767
And whose name is Amar.

426
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:40,711
But there is no such person.

427
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:45,606
The business man, who sells
all the stolen goods,

428
00:43:46,052 --> 00:43:47,679
He is also in our group.

429
00:43:48,588 --> 00:43:50,283
And the theft that
was commited there?

430
00:43:50,489 --> 00:43:53,322
There was no theft commited,
it was all a lie, a deception.

431
00:43:53,826 --> 00:43:57,262
It was just a drama,
It took 6 months to enact it.

432
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,122
Each and every one moved by the word of mouth.

433
00:44:00,733 --> 00:44:02,030
But, don't worry come!

434
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:05,136
There is a hole
in the carpet.

435
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:06,996
It seems someone has
cut it with scissors.

436
00:44:08,174 --> 00:44:09,641
Where can he go?

437
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:50,881
Samson.

438
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,082
Yes Please.

439
00:44:53,452 --> 00:44:54,510
How long will it take?

440
00:44:55,021 --> 00:45:00,118
Prince! A person cannot be given
more then 1 electric shock a day

441
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,293
There are some people who
with a single shock itself.

442
00:45:04,497 --> 00:45:05,828
Loose their memory

443
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:10,932
There are others, who have to be
given even six shocks.

444
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,365
That means you are convincing me
that in six days-

445
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:16,200
Vinay will forget all about his life.

446
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:17,535
What are you talking?

447
00:45:18,077 --> 00:45:19,874
He won't remember even his name.

448
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:34,388
So you are the jewel thief.

449
00:45:35,695 --> 00:45:40,064
I was... but now you are
what's your name?

450
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,197
Vinay, Amar.

451
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:47,338
Police commissioner of Bombay has sworn,

452
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,805
By 26th Jan, he will definately
arrest the Jewel thief.

453
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:52,809
I am very much hurt by this.

454
00:45:53,612 --> 00:45:56,342
It's a pity that the punishment
for the sins of the father,

455
00:45:56,816 --> 00:45:58,113
Is being borne by the son.

456
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:02,151
Do your work.

457
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:52,727
Forget... forget...

458
00:46:54,006 --> 00:46:57,703
Forget that you are Vinay

459
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:01,639
You are not Vinay.

460
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:05,783
You are Amar. You are Amar.

461
00:47:06,185 --> 00:47:09,348
You are Vinay's enemy, Amar

462
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:18,493
Police commissioner's enemy, Amar!

463
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:21,932
Julie's husband, Amar!

464
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,192
Prince Amar!

465
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:30,234
Enemy of the police, Amar

466
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:33,011
Enemy of the police, Delhi Amar.

467
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,854
Daughter, I was helpless.

468
00:47:51,797 --> 00:47:53,264
I am also helpless daddy.

469
00:48:04,743 --> 00:48:07,644
I thought that at least
four shocks have to be given.

470
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:10,305
What did you say?

471
00:48:10,683 --> 00:48:13,914
I thought at least
four shocks have to be given.

472
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:15,548
But in two shocks only

473
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:17,517
His condition became compatible
to your requirement.

474
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:34,033
How are you feeling Prince?

475
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,535
Who are you?

476
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:39,677
Doctor,

477
00:48:41,113 --> 00:48:42,876
My ten year old associate
does not even recongnize me-

478
00:48:43,082 --> 00:48:43,548
Please do something.

479
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:46,880
You be assured that he will
remember everything soon

480
00:48:48,087 --> 00:48:51,215
Which place is this?

481
00:48:52,524 --> 00:48:55,960
Prince Amar. This is your head quarters.

482
00:48:56,528 --> 00:48:59,053
To escape from the police
Your entire group hides here.

483
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:00,694
Amar.

484
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,335
Dr. He doesn't even remember his name.

485
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,027
Police...

486
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:10,434
Police is looking for you from
every corner of the India.

487
00:49:10,943 --> 00:49:12,706
You are blamed for thousands of thefts-

488
00:49:12,845 --> 00:49:14,142
There is a reward of
lakh's of rupees for your arrest.

489
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:16,715
Just try to remember prince
we are all your accomplices.

490
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,653
How did I get
into this condition?

491
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:29,919
Bombay's police commissioner
shot you!

492
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:35,599
You had a severe head injury!
Doctor saved your life by operating.

493
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:37,802
This doctor!

494
00:49:40,572 --> 00:49:45,009
Doctor! Why my legs
are also paining?

495
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:46,411
Prince Amar!

496
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:51,411
Don't you remember that you had
six toes on your right leg.

497
00:49:54,653 --> 00:49:56,644
You always wished to get
The sixth toe removed.

498
00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:02,053
Long with that operation doctor
has removed your toe also.

499
00:50:20,813 --> 00:50:24,772
Amar-Amar you have become alright.

500
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,077
You don't know how happy I am.

501
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,682
What nonsense they are talking.

502
00:50:29,824 --> 00:50:30,916
I Don't belive it

503
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:32,551
They say that
you don't remember anything.

504
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:35,186
You can forget everything
even your wife-

505
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:37,693
But you can
never forget your Neena.

506
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,727
3 most enchanting years
of my life I have spent with you

507
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,327
I have brought some thing
for you, come.

508
00:50:46,972 --> 00:50:51,844
See how beautiful
these flowers are!

509
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:54,472
Let God punish that
police commisioner, who shot you.

510
00:50:55,147 --> 00:50:57,172
It seems he has reached
Sikkim in search of you.

511
00:50:58,650 --> 00:50:59,878
I am very much amused!

512
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,810
When he comes face to face with you
I fear he will meet his end.

513
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:06,954
Oh! Amar, I could never forget you.

514
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:07,948
You are again here!

515
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:12,225
Oh! Mrs. Amar. I was just...

516
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:13,626
You shameless!

517
00:51:13,732 --> 00:51:16,223
How many times I have warned you
to stay away from my husband.

518
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,193
Julie Madam... I came here, just to
enquire about his health.

519
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:20,563
I know you very well.

520
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:22,636
Under false pretences,
you meet him to entice him.

521
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:24,700
You want to take
advantage of his situation.

522
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,038
You are mistaking me!

523
00:51:26,245 --> 00:51:27,143
Get away from here.

524
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:32,043
Get out!

525
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:40,290
Does she know? Doctor said your room
should be peaceful.

526
00:51:41,026 --> 00:51:44,291
But couldn't control my self
after seeing that wretched

527
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:45,454
Look here!

528
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:49,598
Till we weren't married all the
girls had equal rights on you!

529
00:51:50,502 --> 00:51:53,994
But, even after having a child
they are still desiring!

530
00:51:55,107 --> 00:51:55,539
A child!

531
00:51:55,707 --> 00:51:56,605
Okay, leave it!

532
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:59,207
How do you feel now? My, love!

533
00:51:59,637 --> 00:52:02,946
Only one point should be
brought in when Vinay is there-

534
00:52:03,048 --> 00:52:04,811
That, he is Prince Amar
known as "Jewel Thief'

535
00:52:05,984 --> 00:52:08,282
Until he is fully convinced-

536
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:10,114
Our work is half finished.

537
00:52:10,856 --> 00:52:13,120
An excellent theft was committed
in Amritsar!

538
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:15,890
The police were outwitted
in broad day light!

539
00:52:16,328 --> 00:52:19,024
Prince cleaned all the
bank lockers in no time.

540
00:52:19,531 --> 00:52:21,226
And that Mysore, robbery!
Was it any inferior?

541
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:24,031
How tightly secured
Maharaja's museum was

542
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:26,361
Even then, nobody got the wind of it, -

543
00:52:26,572 --> 00:52:29,370
Nobody ever knew where that costly
antique jewellery vanished.

544
00:52:30,476 --> 00:52:33,741
I consider the robbery of seth
bishambar Das's shop as the best.

545
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:35,744
Prince was cutting diamonds right infront of him!

546
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:39,677
And that fool thought that
he was his employee Vinay.

547
00:52:43,522 --> 00:52:44,921
What brothers? Is it true that...

548
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,988
This Vinay's face resembled
with our Prince.

549
00:52:48,193 --> 00:52:52,789
Except this, that his right foot
had 5 toes and Prince had 6.

550
00:52:53,932 --> 00:52:55,194
There was not even a bit of
difference between the two.

551
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:58,127
Can any one tell me? Whether
this Vinay is alive or dead.

552
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,573
If our Prince targets can anyone escape.

553
00:53:05,744 --> 00:53:08,838
That's why his father,
Bombay's police commissioner-

554
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:10,509
Is after the life.

555
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:12,873
First he said that he would
catch him alive-

556
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:16,578
Now, he says that he will
drag the corpse upto Delhi.

557
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:17,948
Is it a joke!?

558
00:53:18,624 --> 00:53:20,057
Let our Prince get better...

559
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:22,417
This police commissioner will
forget all his lofty ideals

560
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:25,192
He will run for his life.

561
00:53:26,064 --> 00:53:27,088
What do you all think!

562
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,499
Will Prince be alright
before 26th January.

563
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:30,190
Why?

564
00:53:30,602 --> 00:53:31,933
Don't you people remember?

565
00:53:32,237 --> 00:53:35,104
On 26th January, the near-by
hill estate Maharaja-

566
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,171
Was to hand over his throne
to his Prince.

567
00:53:37,376 --> 00:53:38,035
Yes, Yes...

568
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:41,546
Prince planned to steal his
crown on that day.

569
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:45,649
10 lakhs worth of jewels are
engraved in that crown.

570
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:53,218
Prince, Prince you have
become alright-

571
00:53:53,425 --> 00:53:54,892
Long live Prince!

572
00:53:55,093 --> 00:53:56,583
Long live Prince!
Long live Prince.

573
00:53:56,616 --> 00:53:56,649
Long live Prince!

574
00:53:56,762 --> 00:53:58,662
Yes, he was staying
in this hotel, -

575
00:53:59,264 --> 00:54:00,663
But he is missing
for so many days now.

576
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,766
Neither he has taken his luggage,
nor has he paid the bill.

577
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:16,906
Hey! Where have you
lost in thoughts?

578
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:24,018
Julie, come near me.

579
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:26,285
Tell me the truth darling.

580
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,917
I am in such a position
that I can't tell anyone-

581
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:30,253
I can't trust anyone

582
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:33,923
All this wealth and treasure
belongs to me.

583
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:36,930
Amar, my Prince,
what has happened to you? -

584
00:54:39,605 --> 00:54:43,905
This is your earnings of
12 years of your blood and sweat

585
00:54:43,938 --> 00:54:43,971
Be brave,
gather your wits even now.

586
00:54:44,142 --> 00:54:46,303
By putting your life in
thousands of dangers-

587
00:54:46,511 --> 00:54:48,035
You have stolen
every single jewel

588
00:54:48,347 --> 00:54:51,043
And for this 1 crore worth
of wealth, you are asking-

589
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,274
Whether it belongs to you

590
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:54,849
Think hard and
try to remember,

591
00:54:55,153 --> 00:54:58,054
This wealth is all yours.
This palace is yours

592
00:54:58,257 --> 00:54:58,916
And they. -

593
00:54:59,157 --> 00:55:01,318
They are your servants who live
on the morsels thrown by you

594
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,729
Doctor, had said that slowly
I will remember everything.

595
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:10,925
What do you mean by slowly you
after you loose every thing by then.

596
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:13,399
I tell you, our people
have revolted

597
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:15,500
When they have no faith
in your strength-

598
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:16,901
How will they respect you?

599
00:55:17,676 --> 00:55:19,303
If you don't remember,
it doesn't matter.

600
00:55:19,678 --> 00:55:22,306
At least you act
in front of them

601
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:26,242
That you are the same jewel thief;
the same Prince Amar-

602
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:28,385
Who was a terror to the police.

603
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:32,416
Who has revolted?

604
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:35,892
Tell me his name
I will beat him into a pulp

605
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:39,222
Who is that brown fellows?
Who can confrent me?

606
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:40,996
Nobody should think that
I am sick

607
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:43,163
I am not an ordinary man

608
00:55:43,368 --> 00:55:44,630
I am jewel thief,
I am jewel thief

609
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:46,062
"The Jewel Thief'

610
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,364
Arey what's this?

611
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,499
Did I impres?

612
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:53,329
Plenty,

613
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:54,095
Now watch.

614
00:56:56,274 --> 00:56:57,400
26th January.

615
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:04,941
Do you people remember that we
have to do something on 26th Jan.

616
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:06,082
We do remember, Prince;

617
00:57:06,284 --> 00:57:07,114
How can you remember?

618
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:10,179
Whole day you are drinking
and playing cards

619
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:15,623
You tell me, what was our plan?

620
00:57:16,628 --> 00:57:19,688
We were to raid
the court of shaito, Prince.

621
00:57:20,465 --> 00:57:23,161
And the crown that was
to be put on Prince's head-

622
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:29,699
I have been entrusted the task
of drawing the map of the court.

623
00:57:29,975 --> 00:57:33,001
As per your order
I went in disguise-

624
00:57:33,211 --> 00:57:34,439
And went through every
nook and corner of the court.

625
00:57:35,847 --> 00:57:37,439
If you permit me,

626
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:40,877
Then on 26th Jan, what type of
function is going to be held

627
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:42,450
Shall I say something about it

628
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:43,586
You are permitted.

629
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:49,593
Prince big personlaties
are coming there.

630
00:57:49,995 --> 00:57:52,395
Foreign ambassadors will also be there

631
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:53,865
So, the security will be very tight.

632
00:57:53,898 --> 00:57:54,766
Can succed in entering only
in disguise of dancers.

633
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,358
Without invitation, a bird also
can't enter there

634
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:59,195
There is only one way
to go inside.

635
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:01,230
There is a
dance programme there.

636
00:58:01,673 --> 00:58:02,901
You and your associates. -

637
00:58:09,714 --> 00:58:11,648
You already know
that once the king...

638
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,977
Has requested our Shalini

639
00:58:14,553 --> 00:58:16,214
To perform a dance
in his court.

640
00:58:16,588 --> 00:58:18,021
Do you remember Shalini?

641
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:20,525
Yes I remember very well

642
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:21,919
Then, tell Prince Amar.

643
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:30,991
King has specially
asked

644
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:37,306
That... at that time... I...

645
00:58:38,043 --> 00:58:40,568
No. No, I will not let this game be successful

646
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:45,078
Vinay. Vinay they are
all your enemies... enemies

647
00:58:45,283 --> 00:58:47,547
You are not Amar
these people have made you mad-

648
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:49,617
So that you should think, yourself
to be the jewel thief-

649
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:52,757
Whatever you are listening,
thinking and understanding-

650
00:58:52,958 --> 00:58:53,822
Is all false.

651
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:57,460
Except me, nobody is yours
here, Don't beleive anyone

652
00:58:57,662 --> 00:59:00,096
Recognize me? Recognize me
I am Shalini, Shalu

653
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,924
You are not Amar,
you are Vinay,

654
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:03,998
Son of Bombay's
Commissioner of police, Vinay.

655
00:59:04,202 --> 00:59:05,533
What nonsence
this girl is talking-

656
00:59:05,737 --> 00:59:06,829
The person who is
my deadliest enemy, -

657
00:59:07,072 --> 00:59:07,936
She is calling him my father.

658
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:10,668
Who has entisted this
mad girl in my gang.

659
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:12,101
This is not your gang

660
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:13,538
Ask her to keep quiet

661
00:59:13,745 --> 00:59:14,939
Otherwise gag her mouth
and take her out

662
00:59:15,213 --> 00:59:17,613
No you are not Amar,
no you are not Amar.

663
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,247
Where is this
police commissioner these days?

664
00:59:24,456 --> 00:59:29,223
And see this. And this photo is...

665
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:37,500
No not this, that one

666
00:59:38,837 --> 00:59:39,735
You are the commissioner?

667
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,604
If you love your life then
get away from my path.

668
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:49,304
Otherwise the way
I have sent your son to hell... -

669
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:49,877
What!

670
00:59:50,115 --> 00:59:52,310
The same way I will
send you there too.

671
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:53,840
I have come to
tell you this only

672
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:57,487
That if you don't disappear
from here by to-morrow

673
00:59:58,156 --> 00:59:59,680
Then you take it
that your death

674
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:01,688
Will be caused by the
bullet of Prince Amar

675
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:03,454
Take away their pistols.

676
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:06,026
Come on, come on

677
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:17,434
You!

678
01:00:18,677 --> 01:00:20,338
You are the daughter of
Bishambhar Das.

679
01:00:20,712 --> 01:00:21,269
Yes Sir.

680
01:00:21,913 --> 01:00:23,676
And I have to
tell you something.

681
01:00:27,819 --> 01:00:29,582
It is 26th January.

682
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:32,384
Police commissioner
has been informed

683
01:00:32,624 --> 01:00:34,114
That a theft will be
commited in the court today

684
01:00:35,026 --> 01:00:37,620
He will leave nothing
to chance, but Prince

685
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,290
I still think,

686
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:42,125
That it is risky to give a
loaded pistol to a mad person.

687
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:47,700
The Pistol will be loaded
but with empty cartridges

688
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:52,534
Police will try to catch
jewel thief alive. Get my point

689
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:56,141
But we want the corpse of the
jewel thief to go out of the court

690
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:57,037
How is it possible?

691
01:00:57,816 --> 01:00:59,784
Police will start firing only

692
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:02,414
When the first attack
will be from the jewel thief

693
01:01:02,687 --> 01:01:05,815
And our jewel thief has threatened
the police commissioner

694
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:08,019
That if he comes forward
he will be shot dead

695
01:01:08,426 --> 01:01:11,190
In spite of this if police tries
to catch Vinay alive. Then...

696
01:01:11,396 --> 01:01:13,523
Under no circumstances Vinay
can be left alive

697
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:15,594
If the police misses

698
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:19,537
Then anyone of you, who gets
a chance, has to do this job

699
01:01:21,272 --> 01:01:22,637
What are you thinking Shalini?

700
01:01:23,408 --> 01:01:25,308
I have told you before
and I repeat it again.

701
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:26,704
I will not dance, I will not dance

702
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,678
You can kill Vinay
you can kill me

703
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:31,910
But by using me
you can never kill Vinay

704
01:01:32,117 --> 01:01:34,278
I am fed up with
your attitude Shalu

705
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,753
If you refuse once again, -

706
01:01:37,222 --> 01:01:40,350
Then in front of you
your brother will be shot dead

707
01:01:40,558 --> 01:01:41,354
You will dance

708
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:44,357
You will not only dance, but you
will keep your mouth shut also

709
01:01:48,967 --> 01:01:52,869
Hey brother look here,
how am I looking

710
01:10:22,914 --> 01:10:26,350
No one will
move out from here!

711
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:36,193
Prince, we have entertained you
won't you give us our presents.

712
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:39,862
What do you want?

713
01:10:41,232 --> 01:10:42,961
I have no temptation
for money and wealth... but...

714
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:46,227
A shining diamond or emerald
is always more tempting!

715
01:10:46,771 --> 01:10:49,296
Yes, you'll be put
to inconvenience!

716
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:50,371
For which I am
extremely sorry?

717
01:10:51,342 --> 01:10:52,707
But, the crown that is
on your head...

718
01:10:53,277 --> 01:10:55,404
Please, remove it
and place it on my head.

719
01:11:04,522 --> 01:11:07,685
If you behave like this
in a loving and affectinate way...

720
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:09,086
Our relationship will be very cordial.

721
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:11,394
A small inconveniance once again! -

722
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,954
Take this prisoner and show him the door

723
01:11:14,699 --> 01:11:17,725
One of your guards
may make a mistake-

724
01:11:17,935 --> 01:11:19,869
And I may be
forced to shoot

725
01:11:25,142 --> 01:11:26,575
Come on... Come on...

726
01:11:31,782 --> 01:11:35,309
Amar, your game is over now.

727
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,113
Drop the pistol! Drop it!!

728
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:40,658
Come on...

729
01:11:40,691 --> 01:11:41,590
Second one also!

730
01:11:43,995 --> 01:11:44,757
Hands up!

731
01:11:47,331 --> 01:11:49,697
Place the crown, once again
on prince's head.

732
01:11:53,904 --> 01:11:56,464
Turn this side, see and then
recognize the person-

733
01:11:57,041 --> 01:11:59,635
...Who has vowed to catch you
before 26 January

734
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:17,828
When bad times come
man looses his senses

735
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:20,254
I had told you
once before also

736
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:22,726
...That, if you love your life
you should leave this place.

737
01:12:24,201 --> 01:12:26,066
It seems that
you don't love your life!

738
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:29,737
Now, I will see, who is going
to catch whom

739
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:33,134
Amar, you have
been arrested.

740
01:12:33,878 --> 01:12:36,005
Now, you cannot
escape from here.

741
01:12:37,114 --> 01:12:39,014
If you fire
one bullet on me...

742
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:41,912
...Serveral bullets will be
rained on you

743
01:12:42,553 --> 01:12:44,145
Look up

744
01:12:44,889 --> 01:12:45,514
Look!!

745
01:13:01,372 --> 01:13:03,704
I don't have the slightest
intentian of shooting...

746
01:13:04,241 --> 01:13:06,209
But, if it starts
from your side...

747
01:13:06,911 --> 01:13:08,435
...Don't blame me for it

748
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:11,447
world knows that. I don't have any connection with

749
01:13:12,416 --> 01:13:14,384
You have blocked,
my every move...

750
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:16,280
And you have tried to
spoil all my plans

751
01:13:16,887 --> 01:13:18,445
I will settle that account
some other day...

752
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:19,550
But now...

753
01:13:19,857 --> 01:13:23,020
You, Please take the trouble
of escorting me outside safely

754
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:27,728
I have never considered my life
more precious than my duty.

755
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:30,400
If you shoot me...

756
01:13:31,268 --> 01:13:33,736
Our people will take
your corpse to Delhi.

757
01:13:34,939 --> 01:13:36,531
I will feel
very sorry about it.

758
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:39,168
Because, I always wanted
to take you alive.

759
01:13:39,944 --> 01:13:41,878
Give it. Hand over the pistol.

760
01:13:42,813 --> 01:13:45,077
It seems you are
a dull headed person-

761
01:13:45,282 --> 01:13:47,079
...And you prefer not to
take those 4 steps with me.

762
01:13:47,785 --> 01:13:49,480
Okay! I will go alone.

763
01:13:49,787 --> 01:13:50,685
Good bye!

764
01:13:51,021 --> 01:13:53,319
If you want the
safety of Mr. Commissioner-

765
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,258
Then withdraw your guns

766
01:13:55,493 --> 01:13:57,427
Don't bother about me,
spray the bullets on him.

767
01:13:57,628 --> 01:13:58,094
Beware,

768
01:13:58,295 --> 01:13:58,989
Start firing.

769
01:13:59,196 --> 01:13:59,924
Beware

770
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:24,121
After to-day, the police force
in India will sleep peacefully.

771
01:14:24,855 --> 01:14:25,947
Because the jewel thief is killed

772
01:14:26,924 --> 01:14:28,551
And we will sleep peacefully, -

773
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,287
Because the police
will sleep peacefully.

774
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,798
It was not possible to do
this job. Without your help

775
01:14:36,634 --> 01:14:38,124
The job that all
of you have done,

776
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:39,859
Can't be rewarded by money.

777
01:14:40,337 --> 01:14:41,804
Even then, infront of each of you

778
01:14:42,006 --> 01:14:44,600
50 thousand rupees

779
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:49,138
Consider this as a small
parting gift from my side.

780
01:14:49,313 --> 01:14:50,473
Good bye

781
01:15:32,056 --> 01:15:34,616
I also can't belive it
but it is the fact

782
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:36,856
I am alive

783
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:38,619
But I saw you dying
with my own eyes.

784
01:15:38,863 --> 01:15:41,491
Can empty cartriges be loaded
only in your pistols

785
01:15:42,533 --> 01:15:43,500
And not in the guns
of the police?

786
01:15:43,701 --> 01:15:44,690
Empty cartriges!

787
01:15:45,569 --> 01:15:46,797
But, how did your father
come to know?

788
01:15:47,004 --> 01:15:48,801
Sir on the paper
from you pad only,

789
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,571
Written by your pen only.

790
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:52,274
In front of
four of your own people.

791
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:54,740
Your servant handed over
the letter tohis father

792
01:15:54,945 --> 01:15:56,640
That means you were not effected
by the electri at all.

793
01:15:56,847 --> 01:15:57,779
Why not?

794
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:01,907
But I understood that you will
definitely make me mad

795
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:03,450
Irrespective of
the number of shocks

796
01:16:03,654 --> 01:16:03,983
That had to be given.

797
01:16:04,188 --> 01:16:05,883
But, I thought
it would be better-

798
01:16:06,156 --> 01:16:09,125
That I should start acting as mad
after getting shocks

799
01:16:10,094 --> 01:16:12,289
And after being associated
with such good actors,

800
01:16:12,496 --> 01:16:14,259
One leasns a
bit of acting

801
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,724
What's the plan now?

802
01:16:18,702 --> 01:16:19,066
My father has plans.

803
01:16:19,703 --> 01:16:22,399
Today's date
is related to 26th January

804
01:16:27,778 --> 01:16:29,609
Will you take these jewels
with you or leave them here

805
01:16:31,315 --> 01:16:34,216
Without the jewels,
the jewel thief won't be complete

806
01:17:10,988 --> 01:17:12,615
You are 20 and we are 50,

807
01:17:13,157 --> 01:17:17,093
Even then you want to fight
we are ready for that

808
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:19,318
But it will be
better for you to

809
01:17:19,697 --> 01:17:24,066
Drop your weapons and
come out with your hands up

810
01:17:26,303 --> 01:17:27,099
Where did you go?

811
01:17:27,304 --> 01:17:28,362
I thought I would
arrest him myself

812
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:29,864
But he, escaped

813
01:17:30,074 --> 01:17:31,302
We have surrounded
the place and laid a strong seige

814
01:17:31,508 --> 01:17:32,133
Even then he slipped away

815
01:17:37,047 --> 01:17:39,174
Sir look, up there, up there.

816
01:17:44,855 --> 01:17:47,722
No Don't shoot him
We have to catch him alive

817
01:17:51,528 --> 01:17:53,519
Daddy, you leave this
job to me

818
01:19:14,278 --> 01:19:14,937
Keep the plane ready

819
01:20:25,349 --> 01:20:26,941
Start the plane
I am coming

820
01:21:01,785 --> 01:21:04,549
Vinay now
you can't harm me

821
01:21:04,822 --> 01:21:07,017
Don't try to enter unnecessarily

822
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:10,788
Fate has saved your life
a number of times, Protect it.

823
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:12,659
If people like us are
worried about our lives-

824
01:21:12,863 --> 01:21:14,353
Then people like you
would have ruled the world.

825
01:21:15,065 --> 01:21:15,895
It's you who has to
save himself, not me.

826
01:21:16,066 --> 01:21:16,834
I coming in

827
01:21:16,867 --> 01:21:19,928
Don't come Vinay
my plan has failed-

828
01:21:20,237 --> 01:21:22,398
I will get nothing
by killing you now

829
01:21:22,606 --> 01:21:25,837
If I had wanted to kill you
I would have killed you long back

830
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:29,143
But I have vowed
to catch you alive

831
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,412
Then you fulfill your vow

832
01:21:32,983 --> 01:21:34,951
Bobby get ready to take off

833
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:36,550
Before you shoot,
Just think,

834
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,045
Till now you have not
been accused of murder.

835
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:41,817
Today, To-morrow or the day after
you will definitely be arrested.

836
01:21:42,092 --> 01:21:43,753
Why do you want
to be hanged after killing me

837
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:45,019
You are a kid Vinay

838
01:21:45,829 --> 01:21:47,854
As you watch
I will be from the Indian Border

839
01:21:48,065 --> 01:21:48,963
Hundreds of miles far away.

840
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:51,066
Where even the angels
of Police won't reach.

841
01:21:51,368 --> 01:21:53,802
You have been useful person
that's why I won't kill you-

842
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:56,206
But you will
always remain my prisoner

843
01:21:56,406 --> 01:21:58,067
You have already made me
your prisoner once

844
01:21:58,609 --> 01:22:00,907
With the result
you are running away-

845
01:22:01,111 --> 01:22:02,078
Like a coward
to save your life

846
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:04,008
Shut up. I am
not running away

847
01:22:04,314 --> 01:22:06,373
I am going away
like a Prince

848
01:22:06,617 --> 01:22:09,177
This is my plane,
this is my wealth

849
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,917
I am the master
of my own life

850
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:15,820
And you... you are
at my mercy

851
01:22:16,026 --> 01:22:17,857
When empty bullets
didn't work-

852
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:19,085
You started giving
empty threats.

853
01:22:19,296 --> 01:22:21,491
Just check. May be
the gun is also empty.

854
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:23,859
You think by your talk...

855
01:22:25,135 --> 01:22:27,262
Bobby, how is this empty?

856
01:22:27,471 --> 01:22:28,665
Now we are ready to fly

857
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:32,065
You please sit on
your seat and tie the belt

858
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:32,934
Anju, what are your doing here?

859
01:22:34,144 --> 01:22:36,112
Who is there with you!?

860
01:22:36,747 --> 01:22:37,611
Where are you going?

861
01:22:38,081 --> 01:22:39,105
Bobby can't meet you now

862
01:22:39,316 --> 01:22:41,216
Thank you. Timing was good

863
01:22:41,418 --> 01:22:43,943
You please come here,
people are waiting for you

864
01:22:44,154 --> 01:22:45,746
Could you hand over this to me

865
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:47,623
Move on

866
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:01,829
Every body has
already assembled here

867
01:23:02,072 --> 01:23:04,131
Yes. They are all here, but now
it will be more interesting

868
01:23:11,281 --> 01:23:12,680
Instead of
becoming interesting-

869
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:13,350
It has become indifferent

870
01:23:13,383 --> 01:23:14,248
Prince you sit here.

871
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:19,584
No, No, Prince, not there. Here
In between these three goddesses,

872
01:23:28,865 --> 01:23:30,765
Prince should not
have any trouble

873
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:35,599
The game is over here
go to your seat,

874
01:23:35,806 --> 01:23:36,329
Myself?

875
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,268
Yes, yes come

876
01:23:50,887 --> 01:23:52,047
Come Sishu we will sit there

877
01:24:04,434 --> 01:24:06,061
Why are you all so sad like this?

878
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:08,702
Winning and loosing is
apart of life

879
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:10,365
Come on, sing a song.,

880
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,231
You sing.

881
01:24:12,743 --> 01:24:15,576
What happened?
Sing a song.

882
01:24:16,446 --> 01:24:17,413
Alright, if not a song
narate a story.

883
01:24:17,614 --> 01:24:18,945
Listen the story from me.

884
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:24,550
There was a "JEWEL THIEF"...
