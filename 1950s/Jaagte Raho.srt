1
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:46,295
Remain Awake!

2
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,834
Who are you?

3
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:33,209
Where do you stay?
Why don't you speak?

4
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:37,623
l am new in this place.
l have come from the village.

5
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:39,352
But what are you doing here?

6
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:41,826
l was looking for some water
-Have the wells in your vilage

7
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:46,123
...dried up, that you came here
looking for water. Go away

8
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,302
Don't appear before me again,
else l'll break your limbs.

9
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:18,669
Life is a dream and where
does truth or lie come in that

10
00:08:51,778 --> 00:09:04,680
l did everything as told
by my heart.

11
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:11,293
When l get free time,
l will try to judge whether...

12
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:14,595
...whatever l did was
right or wrong

13
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:54,638
When a drop of water fell on
the lips of a stone...

14
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:06,408
...it is said that it's heart
started beating after drinking it.

15
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:52,259
l gave one full peg
to my grief filled heart

16
00:10:54,334 --> 00:11:01,137
Poison killed the poison and
dead became alive again.

17
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,402
Excuse me, Sir

18
00:11:37,677 --> 00:11:42,376
Your purse fell down on the road
-And you are returning it?

19
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:51,152
Have one cigarette on this
happy occasion

20
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:56,321
Sir, l don't know how to smoke.

21
00:11:56,396 --> 00:12:08,797
Well, then take this money
and go for race or gambling

22
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:21,653
Sir, l don't take part in gambling.
-Then what do you want?

23
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:27,182
Sir, l am feeling very thirsty.
May l have some water?

24
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:32,195
lf you drink water in this cold,
you will catch pneumonia

25
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:40,536
Buy whatever liquor you can buy
with this money and have it?

26
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:44,402
Sir, l don't drink alcohol

27
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:51,076
You don't drink! Then you must
come with me to my house.

28
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:58,556
So that l can tell my wife
showing you that one who...

29
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:08,056
...doesn't know how to gamble or
drink suffer like you. Come.

30
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:20,035
My wife keeps scolding me not
to do this and not to drink

31
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:30,050
You thief!

32
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:32,693
Who is that?
-A thief!

33
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:41,536
What happened? -A thief
has entered your house

34
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:50,679
Thief! Thief!
Catch him

35
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:03,132
Why are you shouting?
Why are you making the noise?

36
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:07,195
There is a thief.
-Thief! Catch him.

37
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,286
Why have you stopped?
-l am not going ahead.

38
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:59,814
How can you trust the
robbers these days?

39
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:05,122
They may have weapons with
them. You go ahead.

40
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:38,026
What happened?
Who is there? A thief!

41
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:14,296
Why have you stopped? -lf l go
out now, l'll be caught.

42
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,994
Go out soon or my father
will get up

43
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:33,309
l am trapped in a problem.
-What if l get caught, go away

44
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:47,723
Why don't you understand? lf l
am caught, they will beat me

45
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:55,732
You were telling me just now
that you can do anything for me

46
00:19:57,776 --> 00:19:59,744
Do you want me to jump
in Ganga now?

47
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:12,253
lf you don't go l will hang
myself. Just stand & have fun

48
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:17,218
You need not have to do that.
l will cut my neck.

49
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:29,563
Sati, what happened?

50
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:51,552
What are you waiting for?
Go now.

51
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,241
Thief! Catch him

52
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:46,111
Wake up, a thief has entered
the house -Thief! Save us

53
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,091
You go. -Why? -Go

54
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,124
What happened? Where did
he beat you?

55
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:41,132
How could he beat me,
as l escaped & ran away

56
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:53,210
There is no need to fear,
as unity is strength. Let's go

57
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:33,518
You ran away seeing the
image in the glass,

58
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,644
Had there been a real one, then?

59
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,756
lf there is no one, who broke
this lace? Where is Kailashbabu?

60
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:52,434
l am here. But where is my
daughter? Sati...

61
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:17,459
What happened to you,
my daughter?

62
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:20,259
Nothing to worry. She just lost
her consciousness out of fear

63
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,701
How dare you come here again?
l have already warned you...

64
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,433
...against coming here.

65
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:33,274
Actually there was a thief
-So why do you need to care!

66
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:42,253
Let anyone come to my
house. You must go away now.

67
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,690
You are getting angry without
reason. As there was a thief,

68
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:51,058
Then where has he vanished?

69
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,529
We are also having the
same question.

70
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,797
But l swear by your name, l
saw the thief entering this flat

71
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,771
But as there are so many people
here now, how can you identify...

72
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:12,575
...if the thief is hiding among
us? l will suggest that we will...

73
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:16,348
...let everyone pass by the main
door one by one.

74
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:20,482
And the thief willn't definitely
know the flat no.-You are right

75
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:25,788
Attention please! You all stand
up in the queue

76
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,430
Where are you going?
Stand in the queue

77
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:07,162
Silence please!

78
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,540
Do l have to tell the number of
my flat too? -No need

79
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:24,086
What is your flat number?
-50. -And yours -132

80
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:31,358
Yours? -72

81
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:40,066
What is your number?
-l don't know the number

82
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:47,044
l see! Which floor
-Upstairs, third floor

83
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:54,416
Don't know the number. You
thief. Tell me the number

84
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,327
Why are you beating the poor
fellow? He is new here

85
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:17,774
He is Manikbabu's servant.

86
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:34,787
Silence. Let's continue

87
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,137
What is your number?
-27

88
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,576
Number? Why don't you speak?
-27!

89
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:24,542
Have you understood? All have
gone out one by one.

90
00:29:24,609 --> 00:29:31,037
Only Mr Kailash is left. He must
be the thief. What should we do

91
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,016
Huh! Came to catch the thief!

92
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,822
Sati, you had seen the thief.
Have a look and identify him

93
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,492
What's this going on?

94
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:24,228
Nothing, l just got an itching

95
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:28,739
l know all itchings well.
Put your hands down.

96
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:37,207
Have you identified him?
-No, he's not there.

97
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,315
How can you catch the thief, as
thief always reach near...

98
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:44,719
...a sweet thing.
-What have you said?

99
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:49,522
l mean, let the poor people like
us to go as we've to go for...

100
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:53,530
...work in the morning and you
rich people continue the game

101
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:23,793
But l had seen him with my own
eyes. -Then where has he gone

102
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:26,729
He must be hiding
somewhere here.

103
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,461
l keep the door locked as
l have a young daughter

104
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,109
lt's not so easy to catch a thief.
And this house has many holes

105
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,536
He fled that way -Who?
-The thief

106
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:24,104
Now what happened?
-The thief is here

107
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:28,669
Haven't you seen him? -Yes,
he is in my pocket.

108
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:32,410
So you are having great
fun in searching the people's...

109
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:36,318
...houses at night, as you are
quite young in age.

110
00:34:39,124 --> 00:34:42,218
lf the thief is here, go and tell
the police. They'll do something

111
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:57,834
What is the matter?
-l was looking for you only.

112
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:04,512
The young chaps are having
great fun in looking for a thief

113
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:08,018
ln reality, a girl is hiding her
lover inside the house

114
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:16,755
Who is the girl? -Kailashbabu's
daughter Sati -And the boy?

115
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:25,793
Actually l needed a clue for
tomorrow's race

116
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:44,745
lf l don't get some money, l'm
ruined. l'll commit suicide.

117
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:51,194
l'll catch your feet and will not
get up till you say something.

118
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,066
What will happen merely by my
words as the horse won't run as

119
00:35:57,135 --> 00:36:04,701
...per my words.-Your word have
great powers. Last year also,...

120
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:11,579
...your words made the crippled
horse run well & win.

121
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:19,814
l haven't paid the rent for last
six months. And my wife also...

122
00:36:20,058 --> 00:36:26,429
...doesn't talk to me properly.
Please do something

123
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:35,329
But even if l say, will you be
able to put that large amount?

124
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:39,137
Yes, l'll be able to do that.
l'll do it anyway.

125
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:49,349
There it has come! Race no. 6,
Horse no. 8,

126
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:59,628
lf you bet Rs 50/, you will get
Rs. 1 ,000-Let me touch your feet

127
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,800
But next time onwards, l am not
going to do this for just Rs. 20

128
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:23,628
Thief! -Don't shout. lt's me,
your husband

129
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:37,807
So you have come to steal
-Why should l steal?

130
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:42,319
l was just checking the metal.

131
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:49,555
After losing everything in the
race, you are now after my...

132
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:54,792
...jewellery given by father?
Go and commit suicide

133
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:58,324
Don't be too proud of your
father. Anyone can afford to...

134
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,768
...give so much jewellery
with the bribes he got.

135
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:03,773
Don't dare to acuse my father
-Don't talk about the race, then.

136
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:10,405
Thief -You wicked women.
-How dare you call me that

137
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:15,145
How dare you attempt to
beat your husband?

138
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:14,375
l pray to you, don't kill me.
You will be hanged

139
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:43,606
Why this play now? Even you
also attempted to kill me

140
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,724
Thief!

141
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:10,022
Have you seen the thief?

142
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:14,793
Why won't l see him? He is
wearing dirty clothes

143
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,125
Where is he? -He must have
gone down through the window.

144
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:13,785
l pray to you, don't leave
me alone.

145
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:32,468
Come down soon, l am
feeling afraid.

146
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:31,028
What happened? -A thief
broke into my house

147
00:46:31,102 --> 00:46:34,333
But a while ago you told me
that it was Mr. Kailash's...

148
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:37,272
...daughter! ls it your
wife this time? Who is the boy?

149
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:52,716
Tell me who is that bearded man
whom you hide under the bed?

150
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,089
How can l do that, as l
was sleeping?

151
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:04,431
l'll make you reveal
everything now. Let's go in

152
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:50,605
Life is a dream. What is the
truth or lie in that?

153
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:13,699
Go away from my way. l want
to go home, as l didn't go last...

154
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:18,367
...night also. No? Do you want
me to sleep here.

155
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:37,219
Who is actually drunk, you or
me? Go away, friend.

156
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:52,039
That's terrific. That's why
l go for the foreign liquor.

157
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,572
Now, come here

158
00:49:10,561 --> 00:49:23,531
You are so obedient. But you
are completely naked.

159
00:49:28,345 --> 00:49:33,305
Let's go to my house, l'll give
you some nice clothes.

160
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,544
Where are you running away
Come with me.

161
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:44,118
lt's completely dark here.
l'll put on the lights.

162
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,358
Wait, l'll bring clothes for you

163
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,497
Now wear all these clothes

164
00:52:15,446 --> 00:52:22,181
How did the drum come here?
-This is not a drum...

165
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:34,528
...it's my friend. lt obeys all
my words. l'll show you now

166
00:52:34,598 --> 00:52:41,629
Come friend, come ahead

167
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:56,748
Everything changes its colours
here after seeing you

168
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,846
l'll not stay here. -Don't go.
Please listen to me.

169
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,220
Why should l? You don't listen
to me in spite of being my wife.

170
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:07,525
And you now want me to move
in the direction of your fingers?

171
00:53:07,598 --> 00:53:10,590
When have l disobeyed you?

172
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:16,537
Then tell me, why didn't you
obey me that night? Answer me

173
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:20,043
l'll answer you tomorrow. Now
please have the food.

174
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,170
No, l want the answer
now itself.

175
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:30,481
Don't shout. Please have
the food first.

176
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:33,751
l will definitely shout if you
don't answer my question

177
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:38,591
How could l obey that? No
woman will be able to obey that.

178
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:42,598
Why not? Cant's a wife obey
to her husband?

179
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:49,469
No, if the husband doesn't care
for the respect of his wife...

180
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,443
...she willn't obey him too.
You wanted me to dress like...

181
00:53:54,511 --> 00:54:03,749
...those whores, wanted me to go
around with other males & drink

182
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,221
How can any wife tolerate this?

183
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:11,591
Can't a wife even do this much
for the sake of her husband?

184
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:17,692
See, l am your wife. And my
disrespect will bring bad name...

185
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:21,704
...to you too. Why don't you
try to understand?

186
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:28,575
Don't you care a little about the
sacredness of our relationship?

187
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:35,847
Keep your sacredness to yourself.
Cook food and worship the idols

188
00:54:36,086 --> 00:54:39,214
But this god of yours who
as life ,hwill go away for good

189
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:49,322
No, l'll not let you go away. l'll
obey whatever you order to me

190
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:54,393
Will you obey me? -Yes
Will you sing & dance -Yes

191
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:59,170
Will you drink?
Tell me, will you drink?

192
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:06,113
You are my husband. lf you give
me poison, l'll have that too.

193
00:55:06,183 --> 00:55:09,744
Now let's have the food.

194
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,325
Now tell me, what do you
want me to do?

195
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:30,772
Oh! You are beautiful

196
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:36,438
You have never even looked at
my face. How l pity myself!

197
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:41,416
Again the same drama. This
habit makes you look ugly.

198
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:52,460
Don't go, l'll not cry.
-Then sing a song.

199
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:46,775
The cool breeze of spring
is blowing in, my dear and

200
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:54,313
...so don't keep your window
open again.

201
00:56:54,391 --> 00:57:07,293
Or else the maddening wind
will affect you

202
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:52,481
The light of the lamp
is striking the eyes

203
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:09,693
And taking away the sleep
in our eyes, my dear

204
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:17,330
Please don't keep the
lamps burning today.

205
00:58:53,810 --> 00:59:02,775
The cuckoo has doused the
flames of my heart

206
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:19,334
But my love remained thirsty

207
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:45,427
Stop this. Do you call it a song?
-Don't you like the song -No

208
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,600
You consider yourself to be quite
clever. Whenever l feel like...

209
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:57,038
...talking to you, you start giving
lectures. And now l ask you to...

210
00:59:57,107 --> 01:00:00,338
...sing a song, you started
singing prayers.

211
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,742
Then tell me what kind of
song should l sing?

212
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:09,240
Sing such such a hit song which
has a good rhythm & is lively

213
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:12,482
l don't know how to sing
those kind of songs

214
01:00:15,225 --> 01:00:18,854
But we have a record player & l
bring new records everyday...

215
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:22,861
...now you are telling me that
you don't know how to sing that

216
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:30,404
Have you heard that 'Lucy wow
wow' song? -Yes

217
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:33,169
Then sing that song.
Come with me.

218
01:00:35,478 --> 01:00:40,279
Sit here and sing.
You spoiled my mood.

219
01:01:30,767 --> 01:01:41,507
All the bottles are vanishing.
Now l'll not let you go.

220
01:01:57,394 --> 01:01:59,726
Excuse me for now, l'll sing the
song some other time

221
01:01:59,796 --> 01:02:06,634
No, you have to sing it now
-l am having a headache

222
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:13,564
Don't make excuses in front of
me. You want to fool me.

223
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:18,046
lt's okay then -No, l'll sing

224
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:42,760
l can't really sing -Then dance,
like the one in films

225
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:53,244
What is her name?
Wear this dress and dance.

226
01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,415
What do you get by insulting
me? What pleasure do you get...

227
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:02,549
...by giving pain to my soul?

228
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,820
As per the scriptures, there is
no soul in woman.

229
01:03:05,061 --> 01:03:07,495
Then why cry over something
which you don't have

230
01:03:07,564 --> 01:03:14,766
What are you doing? Wait, l'll
change the dress and dance

231
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:32,583
Now you only can tell me.
l have already done enough.

232
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:40,585
How much will l have to
fall? What should l do?

233
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,113
Why are you taking so much
time. Come soon

234
01:04:02,185 --> 01:04:16,725
l am putting on the record. l'll
count till three and if you don't...

235
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:24,164
...come, l'll break the record.

236
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:34,582
Won't you come? Okay!
One, two..., here you've come!

237
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,834
What are you doing by standing
there? Come near me

238
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:34,401
Let me have a look at you.
Come near me.

239
01:05:42,518 --> 01:05:45,248
l am only one and
lovers are many!

240
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:50,657
They attack my
heart together

241
01:06:08,678 --> 01:06:12,637
See, what a problem l have
got in my small heart

242
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:50,116
My cheek is of pink colour
and have blue eyes

243
01:06:50,186 --> 01:06:55,385
People think that l am shining
like a thunderbolt when l smile

244
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:00,352
Where have you vanished?

245
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:28,180
Oh! You haven't worn your
clothes till now

246
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:41,597
How dare you stand naked in
front of me? Get out

247
01:08:55,378 --> 01:08:56,743
Go off and never come back!

248
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:51,531
See some rascal has kept the
drum in the middle

249
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:55,799
They are not at all sincere.
-Let's take it away

250
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:03,837
Why are you making the noise?
Have you caught the thief?

251
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,541
Not the thief, but the drum
-Whose drum is this?

252
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:13,111
You have kept the drum in the
middle & asking us whose it is!

253
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:20,118
This drum actually belongs to the
rascal opposite my room

254
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:24,599
He is not at all sincere. He
keeps even the garbage...

255
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:33,097
...in front of my door. You are
all strong. Go & complain to him.

256
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,647
What's the matter-Why have
you kept your drum in middle

257
01:10:53,095 --> 01:10:57,088
That's his drum, not mine.
-But he is saying that it's yours

258
01:10:57,166 --> 01:11:01,626
How dare you? -Can't you
identify the owner of this...

259
01:11:01,704 --> 01:11:08,234
...drum with a hole even by
looking at the whole in his vest?

260
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:33,661
So the drum is not yours -No
Not even yours -No

261
01:11:33,736 --> 01:11:45,113
Lift the drum -Wait, if it doesn't
belong to anybody give it to me

262
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:47,649
Come my son, let's take it inside

263
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:55,617
How dare you take it?
Give it to me?

264
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:05,123
Not you, l'll take it

265
01:12:05,201 --> 01:12:08,364
What are you waiting for?
Drag the drum inside

266
01:12:47,343 --> 01:12:53,771
Wait. Do you want the drum?
-Yes,-Do you want it too?-Yes

267
01:12:56,552 --> 01:13:03,583
Then l'll toss this coin
-Head for him, tail for him

268
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:16,133
See the drum is running away

269
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:27,436
Police?

270
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:34,582
Lalbazar! Please transfer
the call to the police

271
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,173
Have you caught the thief?

272
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:10,344
lf the thief was caught, was
there any need to call you all?

273
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:12,512
He has vanished from the place
-Where has he vanished?

274
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:13,612
Now tell him

275
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,033
Police! Police!

276
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:41,178
Open the door

277
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:47,778
Where is he? -l don't know

278
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,352
Then why did you shot the gun

279
01:15:50,426 --> 01:15:56,626
l was afraid to see it jump
-Whose jump, the thief's?

280
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:59,600
No, the mouse

281
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:06,265
You killed the mouse with one
shot. What an aim you have!

282
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:12,679
Actually the shot hit the statue
& it fell down killing the mouse

283
01:16:12,748 --> 01:16:15,683
Let me see the rifle
-Yes, sure

284
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:20,745
Do you have a licence?
-Yes -Please show it to me

285
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:40,766
There is nobody in this room,
nothing is there

286
01:16:50,452 --> 01:16:51,510
What do these boxes contain?

287
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:00,693
See the licence Sir. There is just
water in those bottles, as l...

288
01:17:00,763 --> 01:17:06,065
...am suffering from indigestion.
-So you keep a factory of them

289
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:10,636
Constable, confiscate all the
boxes, & search the room

290
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:29,589
ls the thief caught? -Not thief,
but the main thing -What?

291
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:37,260
As you are also into duplicate
medicine, go & remove them

292
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:41,633
Don't know who called the
police -My God! lt was me.

293
01:17:46,775 --> 01:17:48,709
Police! Remove the goods quickly

294
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:05,153
We have come from the Press

295
01:18:10,032 --> 01:18:11,693
Now we will have fun

296
01:18:17,339 --> 01:18:22,572
Hello lnspector. But who is he?
ls he the leader of looters?

297
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:27,377
No, he makes liquor. Now we
have arrested him

298
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:43,455
Why are you leaving, lnspector?
What will happen to the thief

299
01:18:43,532 --> 01:18:47,298
What can we do unless you
allow us to search the flats

300
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:51,100
Yes, go for it. -Are you mad?
We are all gentleman here

301
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:53,164
We are respectable people.

302
01:18:53,242 --> 01:18:57,076
Do you consider search to be
some child-play? -Seen that?

303
01:18:57,146 --> 01:19:00,081
But there is a thief inside
-So what?

304
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:03,380
You are young people. Keep
yourselves on guard

305
01:19:03,452 --> 01:19:05,386
Learn how to stand on your feet

306
01:19:05,454 --> 01:19:08,548
Yes, why expect help from
others in every step?

307
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:16,088
OK, do whatever you feel to be
right. But don't take law...

308
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:19,396
...into your hands. -We will
do that.

309
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:23,427
We are businessmen. So we
always keep the law at bay

310
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:28,709
Let's go -Thank you, lnspector

311
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:49,124
Worn out clothes, long bearded
How long was the beard

312
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:50,790
Do you think l measured it?

313
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:03,633
Go and call the police
immediately.

314
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:06,510
l'll make them search all
the flats now

315
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:12,179
What happened? -You acted
clever & send back the police

316
01:20:12,254 --> 01:20:13,846
Now you are asking what
has happened?

317
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:18,788
The thief had tried to snatch my
daughter's necklace.

318
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:22,228
Had anything happened to her,
would you have taken the...

319
01:20:22,297 --> 01:20:23,855
...responsibility?
-But where is the thief?

320
01:20:24,099 --> 01:20:27,159
Do you expect a child to tell
you about the thief?

321
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:31,605
What are you waiting for? Ask
the police to come with warrents

322
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:39,205
Have patience. The problem is
not only yours. lt is everyone's

323
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:45,652
Before taking any step, we will
have to consider it well at first

324
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:50,181
Yes, once the police is here, it
will be a disrespect for us.

325
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:53,524
Can't we protect ourselves?
We are not wearing bangles

326
01:20:57,366 --> 01:21:00,665
What happened? -Hah, you are
the first to collect donations...

327
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:06,572
...for any problem of others. Now
when we are having problems...

328
01:21:06,642 --> 01:21:08,507
...at home, -But what is the
matter?

329
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,512
l am asking you to prepare one
voluntary guard squad.

330
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:17,416
Otherwise what is the use of
your strength & our donations?

331
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:19,818
Go and prepare the squad

332
01:21:56,892 --> 01:22:02,489
Attention please!
-Look at me

333
01:22:02,564 --> 01:22:11,268
Some of you come and make our
guard squad stronger...

334
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:16,368
...so that we can catch the thief.

335
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:33,152
Stand on the queue.
Start playing

336
01:22:52,814 --> 01:22:56,807
As the family members never
rest in peace till they find the..

337
01:22:56,885 --> 01:23:02,790
...snake & search in every corner
of the house, we willn't also...

338
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:10,193
...take a rest till we find
out the thief.

339
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:12,219
lf you want to catch the thief,
come with me

340
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:20,567
Why are you disturbing us?
-lt's my democratic right to...

341
01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:28,599
...disturb you. My wife is missing.
And it's your duty to find her.

342
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:45,187
Follow me. -Shut up!
Take him to his room.

343
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:18,349
Where is your sword, Sardarji?

344
01:25:18,427 --> 01:25:25,026
Attention! Please have a picture
of the enemy in your mind

345
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:32,632
He is long haired & wearing
worn out clothes.

346
01:25:32,707 --> 01:25:41,081
His eyes are large & terrifying.
Grab him whenever you find him

347
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:47,748
Now shout with me again:
We are ready to give our lives

348
01:26:13,114 --> 01:26:14,741
This is the drum where the thief
was hiding. -Really?

349
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:32,193
Brother, Rambabu has annouced
2 carat gold medal for the one...

350
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:34,667
...who catches the thief.
-ls it so?

351
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:45,502
Go and tell the others that only
standing on guard will not help.

352
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,515
They will have to search in
every corner of each house.

353
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:51,347
As the thief was hiding inside
the drum last time...

354
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:57,449
...we should not spare any box
or trunks from checking

355
01:26:57,526 --> 01:26:59,187
lf somebody objects then?

356
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:02,492
Who will object, as this is
everyone's problem?

357
01:27:02,564 --> 01:27:07,331
This is a matter of respect for
us. We have to win the medal.

358
01:27:13,475 --> 01:27:17,571
Do you all have Kirpans with
you -Yes

359
01:27:17,646 --> 01:27:19,671
Beware, the thief should
not run away.

360
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:38,321
Do you know, they've announced
a medal for the thief-catcher

361
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:44,737
l will definitely win the medal
-Not you, l'll win the medal

362
01:28:01,089 --> 01:28:04,547
Let me tickle you and
check your courage

363
01:28:18,373 --> 01:28:22,776
Atulbabu, please open the door.
We have to search the rooms

364
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:26,003
Wait, l am coming

365
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:31,183
What do you want?
-Check everything in the room

366
01:28:36,391 --> 01:28:38,120
Beware, l'll call the police
-Who is in the room?

367
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:41,492
My wife -Get away

368
01:28:46,768 --> 01:28:48,793
Who is there?-Please
arrange your clothes

369
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:55,738
We have to search your room
-Not searching, but having fun

370
01:29:00,578 --> 01:29:01,670
Are you familiar with
Mr. Rambabu?

371
01:29:01,746 --> 01:29:04,806
Rambabu, the person who
has declared the medal? -Yes

372
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:09,444
Go to him alongwith some of
them & collect some donations

373
01:29:11,522 --> 01:29:13,649
What happened? ls the thief
caught -No, it's drugs

374
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:18,354
Drugs? -They found two boxfull
of Drugs is Atulbabu's room

375
01:29:18,429 --> 01:29:21,125
He is now asking them to accept
Rs. 200 bribe & keep mum

376
01:29:21,365 --> 01:29:24,129
Who is Atulbabu?
-That bald one in room no. 108

377
01:29:24,368 --> 01:29:28,668
Go and collect donation of not
less than Rs.100. l'll go upstairs

378
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:42,113
ls Rambabu awake? We are
voluteers here. We have some...

379
01:29:42,186 --> 01:29:44,416
...urgent work with him.
-Please have a seat.

380
01:29:52,897 --> 01:29:55,491
How do these people earn so
much money, friend?

381
01:29:55,566 --> 01:29:58,467
Why not? They are not
uneducated like us to sit by...

382
01:29:58,536 --> 01:30:01,403
...the footpath. He was
abroad for 7 years.

383
01:30:01,472 --> 01:30:04,134
He learnt to earn money
there itself.

384
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:10,675
What's the matter?
Why have you come?

385
01:30:10,748 --> 01:30:16,653
We are volunteers & we have to
keep awake the whole night

386
01:30:16,721 --> 01:30:20,919
So we need some money to have
tea-Give Rs. 20-

387
01:30:20,992 --> 01:30:28,956
No, we will have Rs. 100 from
you -So much! OK, l'll give.

388
01:30:29,033 --> 01:30:32,969
l'll give Rs. 30. But what have
done done to catch the thief?

389
01:30:33,037 --> 01:30:35,597
He will be caught, as he
can't run away.

390
01:30:35,673 --> 01:30:38,733
Volunteers are searching every
room in first & second floor

391
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:41,778
By now they must have reached
the third floor also

392
01:30:41,846 --> 01:30:45,509
Are you searching every room?

393
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:49,519
Not only the rooms but each
corner. -They found bags of...

394
01:30:49,587 --> 01:30:51,555
...drugs in Atulbabu's room.

395
01:30:53,991 --> 01:30:56,425
Who asked you to search the
rooms? -After you have...

396
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:59,588
...declared the medal, all have
become like hunting dogs

397
01:30:59,664 --> 01:31:03,930
They will even search your house
also -OK, you may go now

398
01:31:06,604 --> 01:31:10,870
But the donation? -You'll
get that later. Go now.

399
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:23,111
Don't open the main door

400
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:49,772
How much have you printed?
-We are just starting the Rs 5

401
01:31:49,847 --> 01:31:55,547
How much is the order?
-5,000 for Assam, 7,000 for...

402
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:59,351
...Bihar and 10,000 for U.P.
-Stop whatever you have...

403
01:31:59,423 --> 01:32:01,323
...finished till now. And
disconnect the machine.

404
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:06,955
But Sir, we have to deliver all
the money by tomorrow morning!

405
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:08,760
Just obey whatever l have said.

406
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:21,539
He must be drunk. Go &
tell him that the money will...

407
01:32:21,612 --> 01:32:26,049
...have to be taken out anytime
as it is dangerous now, Madan

408
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,380
The world is accusing one
as theif without reason

409
01:32:34,058 --> 01:32:38,518
Ask your heart who is not
the thief?

410
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:43,966
Have l told you a lie -No
Have l mixed poison -No

411
01:33:39,824 --> 01:33:44,090
The people are becoming richer
by taking money from the poor

412
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:48,655
l am calling it theft and
people call it your good fortune

413
01:34:01,379 --> 01:34:03,609
Be careful & stay away!

414
01:34:32,476 --> 01:34:38,881
l have seen many scholars
taking God's name & give alms

415
01:34:38,949 --> 01:34:42,112
But in real life they
enjoy the public money

416
01:35:09,647 --> 01:35:14,675
l have seen the honest ones
getting hanged

417
01:35:26,897 --> 01:35:28,762
And the guilty are
enjoying freely

418
01:35:33,737 --> 01:35:34,999
Am l telling a lie -No

419
01:36:10,374 --> 01:36:13,775
The thief should not run away
while we are busy in singing

420
01:36:13,844 --> 01:36:15,835
You go that way,
we'll go this way

421
01:36:24,955 --> 01:36:27,788
Sardarji, come this way
and have a seat

422
01:36:54,685 --> 01:36:56,778
What is your name?

423
01:37:01,325 --> 01:37:03,850
Why don't you tell me
your name?

424
01:37:07,498 --> 01:37:10,490
Answer me

425
01:37:32,957 --> 01:37:36,358
Who are you?

426
01:38:28,078 --> 01:38:29,602
See, he died as he
was laughing too much.

427
01:38:37,955 --> 01:38:38,819
Please bring some water

428
01:38:56,073 --> 01:38:59,440
lt is not going to help this way,
let's take him to the hospital

429
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:10,150
This entire hue and cry about
the thief is baseless

430
01:39:10,387 --> 01:39:15,518
Actually someone must have
considered one as a thief..

431
01:39:15,592 --> 01:39:19,824
...in his intoxication.
Everything is false

432
01:39:19,897 --> 01:39:22,866
But is there anything true in
life? You are your father's son...

433
01:39:22,933 --> 01:39:26,801
...& you are son's father. Then in
reality are you a son or a father

434
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:31,439
Seen this picture of Mr Ram? He
trades in fake notes...

435
01:39:31,508 --> 01:39:37,743
...still people call him Rambabu.
l have never gone to the...

436
01:39:37,815 --> 01:39:43,811
...medical college ever, still l am
a doctor. Don't laugh like that.

437
01:39:43,887 --> 01:39:47,914
Have you ever seen your face in
the mirror? Girls will faint...

438
01:39:47,991 --> 01:39:53,088
...seeing you. Still your name is
Madan. So whatever is going on...

439
01:39:53,163 --> 01:40:00,797
...in the world is true. -All your
arguments are scientific.

440
01:40:02,372 --> 01:40:02,861
What is this?

441
01:40:09,446 --> 01:40:11,437
Where are they taking
Kumbhakarna?

442
01:40:11,515 --> 01:40:15,849
What is the matter?
Why don't you tell me?

443
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,796
Tell Rambabu that l'll be back
soon after solving this problem

444
01:40:38,842 --> 01:40:41,970
Silence! What happened to him?

445
01:40:42,045 --> 01:40:47,415
He became senseless while
laughing- Speak in turns.

446
01:40:47,484 --> 01:40:51,079
He again became senseless
after gaining consciuousness

447
01:40:51,155 --> 01:40:52,588
Let me examine him

448
01:40:58,862 --> 01:41:00,352
Not a serious problem

449
01:41:16,580 --> 01:41:20,539
ls he caught? -Don't make
noise in the hospital

450
01:41:20,617 --> 01:41:25,782
But there was a thief. -Go &
catch the thief outside, not here

451
01:41:37,668 --> 01:41:40,432
Why've you taken the trouble to
come here? l was going anyway

452
01:41:40,504 --> 01:41:44,964
His condition is so serious that
he has to be admitted in hospital

453
01:41:45,042 --> 01:41:51,572
Who? -My employee, he got a
cardiac arrest following...

454
01:41:51,648 --> 01:42:00,056
...the noise about the thief.
-l'll just join you

455
01:42:09,032 --> 01:42:10,329
But why are you looking
so worried?

456
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,665
lf you want to work under
me, don't argue

457
01:42:13,737 --> 01:42:16,433
Go and make all the
arrangements and wait for..

458
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:21,341
...my signal. As soon as you get
it, carry all the money...

459
01:42:21,411 --> 01:42:25,142
...to the safe place without
stopping anywhere in the middle

460
01:42:39,429 --> 01:42:40,657
Open it

461
01:42:51,141 --> 01:42:56,477
We will bring the stretcher soon.
Ask Madan to give all the money

462
01:43:19,369 --> 01:43:20,836
ls there anything left?
-No

463
01:43:20,904 --> 01:43:24,931
Disconnect the machine, l am
coming downstairs

464
01:43:31,048 --> 01:43:32,538
Give me the key of this room

465
01:46:30,026 --> 01:46:43,030
Do it fast. Make him lie down in
the bed and cover him

466
01:46:48,845 --> 01:46:50,335
Let's take him to the
hospital first

467
01:46:57,954 --> 01:46:58,477
Come fast

468
01:47:22,078 --> 01:47:25,309
Don't gather here,
please go away

469
01:47:28,552 --> 01:47:34,354
There he is dying and you are
having fun by gathering here

470
01:47:34,424 --> 01:47:36,358
Go away

471
01:47:45,101 --> 01:47:49,538
Take away the stretcher and
bring in the bed

472
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:01,714
Spread all the notes on the bed

473
01:48:19,369 --> 01:48:20,859
Doctor, it's all now your
responsibility

474
01:48:20,937 --> 01:48:22,837
Mine? -Of course

475
01:48:46,329 --> 01:48:48,354
As soon as you get my signal,
carry the bed on your shoulders..

476
01:48:48,431 --> 01:48:51,059
...and don't stop anywhere in the
middle till you cross the gate

477
01:48:52,602 --> 01:48:54,502
Baralbabu and Pranbabu is here
-Bring them in

478
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:57,972
No, not here. They may also
have similiar business.

479
01:48:58,041 --> 01:49:01,408
But why should l show them my
privacy? Go & keep them busy...

480
01:49:01,478 --> 01:49:02,775
...in talking. l'll join you

481
01:49:07,717 --> 01:49:10,652
Both of you go out & stand on
guard on the road -Ok

482
01:49:24,801 --> 01:49:26,462
Rambabu will join us, let's
have a seat there

483
01:49:26,536 --> 01:49:30,472
We have come to meet you, not
him -Me?

484
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,371
Doctor, we need the bed urgently

485
01:49:32,442 --> 01:49:38,745
The bed is highly in demand this
night. -How come?

486
01:49:38,815 --> 01:49:42,945
Rambabu is sending his goods in
the bed tonight. l have already...

487
01:49:43,019 --> 01:49:47,547
...issued a death certificate for
him. How can l do it again?

488
01:49:47,624 --> 01:49:51,082
Whenever we are in need, you
always say Rambabu is...

489
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:54,927
...sending his goods. -Then how
will we run our business?

490
01:49:54,998 --> 01:49:56,898
We also donate a lot of money
for this hospital

491
01:49:58,535 --> 01:50:01,800
Baralbabu, it was my idea to
open the hospital, and l put...

492
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:04,704
...my money on it at first. So my
goods will always go first

493
01:50:04,774 --> 01:50:06,469
Then what's the use of
putting our money in it

494
01:50:06,543 --> 01:50:09,535
Stop this rubbish now. l want to
know from the doctor...

495
01:50:09,612 --> 01:50:12,103
...whether we will get the
bed or not

496
01:50:12,349 --> 01:50:17,082
Keep your cool in this trying
time. lt's no use losing temper

497
01:50:20,523 --> 01:50:24,755
What are you saying, Rambabu?
You are our elder & learned too

498
01:50:24,828 --> 01:50:29,458
Excuse us for speaking like this
out of anger. But please help us

499
01:50:29,532 --> 01:50:32,501
Please do something as there is
danger around

500
01:50:32,569 --> 01:50:36,767
Why should you be worried as
your goods are minimum

501
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,003
So what? The danger is not
minimum

502
01:50:40,076 --> 01:50:44,809
OK, if you have faith on me,
bring all your goods to my house

503
01:50:44,881 --> 01:50:46,906
l will take care of them.

504
01:50:49,052 --> 01:50:51,850
Sometimes you really talk
funny

505
01:50:54,391 --> 01:50:57,986
This is not the time to laugh.
Carry the bed out.

506
01:50:58,061 --> 01:50:59,892
So the bed is already loaded

507
01:50:59,963 --> 01:51:02,431
Yes, go and bring your goods
here as fast

508
01:51:06,503 --> 01:51:07,993
Why are you bringing yourself to
all these troubles?

509
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:12,804
Doctor, you are my employee
not l am yours

510
01:51:12,876 --> 01:51:17,677
Can you tell me the reason?
-Because you are more intelligent

511
01:51:17,747 --> 01:51:22,411
Yes. As l scolded them l had to
bring them back to me...

512
01:51:22,485 --> 01:51:25,454
...otherwise they will tell
everyone after going out

513
01:51:28,024 --> 01:51:29,787
Now come and let's take
Mayeed out

514
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:34,159
No, first spread the news of his
death outside, then l'll carry him

515
01:51:34,397 --> 01:51:39,425
ls it so? Then take this. Now all
the responsibility is yours.

516
01:51:45,542 --> 01:51:47,009
Where is Chandubabu?
-He has gone that way

517
01:51:47,076 --> 01:51:51,172
Go & tell him that if he wants
to catch the thief...

518
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:54,611
...he should meet Gopichand
immediately.

519
01:51:57,020 --> 01:52:00,717
Meaning? -l want to bring down
the heat in Rambabu

520
01:52:07,831 --> 01:52:08,957
What happened Rambabu?

521
01:52:09,032 --> 01:52:14,937
How can l say! He was my old
employee from the village.

522
01:52:15,004 --> 01:52:20,772
He got fever suddenly and died

523
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:30,815
He is our Rambabu. He has
announced a reward of a...

524
01:52:30,887 --> 01:52:36,587
...gold medal to the thief catcher.
-Please make some space

525
01:52:42,532 --> 01:52:45,501
Gold medal... -Listen to another
news. One of his old employees...

526
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:48,799
...was having a weak heart and
he died few hours back

527
01:52:48,872 --> 01:52:50,635
Can you please show us
the dead body

528
01:52:53,009 --> 01:52:54,033
There is the bed. Let's see it

529
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:57,341
We have to take a photo.

530
01:53:03,353 --> 01:53:06,845
What's the noise? This is a
hospital. Go away from here

531
01:53:09,092 --> 01:53:11,925
Why are you troubling the
others? -What do you mean?

532
01:53:11,995 --> 01:53:17,627
We have seen the thief in the
hospital. Go there with a force...

533
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:25,072
...and check all the covered
things well. -Are you sure?

534
01:53:25,141 --> 01:53:29,441
lf you don't find the thief there,
l'll give you a gold medal

535
01:53:35,952 --> 01:53:36,919
Remove the cloth from his face

536
01:53:36,986 --> 01:53:41,047
lt'll not be removed. Lift him
and carry him outside

537
01:53:41,124 --> 01:53:43,615
We want to take a photograph
for Press, why're you objecting?

538
01:53:43,693 --> 01:53:45,558
Objecting? -Actually,

539
01:53:47,130 --> 01:53:49,963
You want to have fun with
the dead body

540
01:53:52,468 --> 01:53:54,993
No, l'll not allow you to take my
brother's photograph

541
01:53:55,071 --> 01:54:02,568
We don't get peace even after
death -See what have you done!

542
01:54:05,615 --> 01:54:11,952
Listen, it'll just take one second,
& it'll be published in newspaper

543
01:54:14,924 --> 01:54:19,691
No, we don't see dead man's
face in our community

544
01:54:26,369 --> 01:54:29,930
Why don't you leave, as he
is objecting

545
01:54:30,006 --> 01:54:34,943
But what is there to object?
-Why not? You have no right...

546
01:54:35,011 --> 01:54:39,471
...to play with people's
sentiments and beliefs

547
01:54:39,549 --> 01:54:45,010
But will you object if we take a
photo of the covered dead body?

548
01:54:49,726 --> 01:54:52,160
OK, take it

549
01:55:05,508 --> 01:55:08,102
l'll count till three and you
uncover the face by that time

550
01:55:39,509 --> 01:55:40,942
Halt your search. Come with me

551
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:48,644
l had given all the responsibility
to you. Then how could that...

552
01:55:48,718 --> 01:55:52,882
...person get in there? -l don't
know anything about it, Rambabu

553
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:03,326
Don't try to fool me, you know
that my name is Ram Mullick

554
01:56:05,535 --> 01:56:09,938
Please believe me. l swear, l
don't know anything.

555
01:56:24,454 --> 01:56:27,480
The news is already spread that
Mayeed is dead. And Press also..

556
01:56:27,557 --> 01:56:29,957
...took his photograph. lf
we get a real dead body...

557
01:56:30,026 --> 01:56:33,985
...what's wrong in it?
-You are right Sir

558
01:56:45,374 --> 01:56:46,932
Poison

559
01:56:52,115 --> 01:56:53,582
Come with me soon

560
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:04,051
Somehow we will have
to finish him soon

561
01:58:04,287 --> 01:58:05,982
He has seen everything

562
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:17,488
Aren't you the thief? You need
money, don't you?

563
01:58:17,567 --> 01:58:23,665
Come, l'll give you money.
Bring all the money.

564
01:58:33,316 --> 01:58:36,046
Take these money. Madan, hang
a piece of cloth there.

565
01:59:17,927 --> 01:59:20,862
lf we open the door, they will
cut you to pieces. Go this way.

566
02:00:09,879 --> 02:00:12,541
Thief! Thief!

567
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:36,645
Madan, go to the terrace
immediately

568
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:49,954
You also go there, & finish him
before anyone reaches there

569
02:03:50,032 --> 02:03:56,870
Take this. But careful, you
shouldn't be seen -OK

570
02:06:22,751 --> 02:06:26,710
Beware! lf anyone comes
forward, l'll break his head

571
02:06:33,662 --> 02:06:37,792
What is my fault that you are
following me? l am the son of...

572
02:06:37,866 --> 02:06:42,064
...a poor village farmer. l came
to the city in search of a job.

573
02:06:42,137 --> 02:06:46,972
Being thirsty, l get inside your
flat to have few drops of water

574
02:06:47,042 --> 02:06:50,603
You consider it to be my fault
and treating me like a dog...

575
02:06:50,679 --> 02:06:57,278
...by calling me a thief.
But am l the real thief?

576
02:06:57,353 --> 02:07:03,019
l have seen different kinds of
thieves & thefts in all the flats...

577
02:07:03,092 --> 02:07:05,652
...l have entered. Right from
looting respect of a wife..

578
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:12,930
...to stealing wife's jewelleries,
printing fake notes...

579
02:07:13,001 --> 02:07:17,768
...and making liquor, l have seen
all kinds of sinners & thieves

580
02:07:19,475 --> 02:07:22,911
Being educated, you only want to
give me the lesson that...

581
02:07:22,978 --> 02:07:28,883
...one can't be rich without being
a thief! Okay, this poor has...

582
02:07:28,951 --> 02:07:37,017
...learnt today that l should be a
thief or a robber and gather...

583
02:07:37,092 --> 02:07:40,892
...money by ill means and become
richer than you all by crushing...

584
02:07:40,963 --> 02:07:45,400
...your heads. l will do
that for sure.

585
02:08:16,064 --> 02:08:17,395
Who are you?

586
02:08:26,508 --> 02:08:27,770
Are you the thief?

587
02:08:42,591 --> 02:08:44,957
The door should be kept open
in the morning, otherwise...

588
02:08:45,027 --> 02:08:47,086
...how will the light come inside?

589
02:09:01,009 --> 02:09:05,036
What is this? You hurt your
head and it's now bleeding

590
02:09:08,784 --> 02:09:20,525
Let me see it. lt's bleeding a lot
& you haven't put any medicine

591
02:09:20,596 --> 02:09:26,967
Won't your mother beat you?
-l don't have a mother

592
02:09:40,549 --> 02:09:44,952
What have you stolen?
-l stole nothing at all

593
02:09:47,422 --> 02:09:53,418
Will you steal my bangles? l'll
not tell to anybody. Take these

594
02:10:07,409 --> 02:10:15,373
l am not a thief, child.
l have never stolen anything

595
02:11:42,638 --> 02:11:53,378
Wake up

596
02:11:58,353 --> 02:12:08,126
When the light comes and
removes the darkness of mind

597
02:12:17,339 --> 02:12:22,868
Wake up, my Lord Mohan

598
02:12:46,768 --> 02:12:51,432
Wake up as the world
has woken up

599
02:13:18,033 --> 02:13:32,778
Wake up, Lord Mohan. The new
age is touching your eyes

600
02:13:39,154 --> 02:13:44,353
Wake up, as all the roads &
cities have woken up

601
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:10,915
Afraid? But you haven't
done anything

602
02:14:16,558 --> 02:14:20,688
You will always find the
world shining...

603
02:14:20,762 --> 02:14:25,722
...if you burn the lamp
in your mind.

604
02:15:43,812 --> 02:15:47,475
The sunlight is making
the earth shine

605
02:15:47,549 --> 02:15:52,680
And fills the thirst of
everyone yearning for light

606
02:15:54,689 --> 02:16:01,060
The sunlight is making
the earth shine

607
02:16:01,329 --> 02:16:09,429
And fills the thirst of
everyone yearning for light

608
02:16:10,639 --> 02:16:14,632
And the mind's worries go
away and it blossoms.

609
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:24,451
Wake up, dear Lord Mohan!

610
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:29,881
The new age is touching
your eyes.

611
02:16:30,926 --> 02:16:34,555
Wake up, dear Lord Mohan!

612
02:16:36,665 --> 02:16:40,123
All the cities, roads
have woken up

613
02:17:19,874 --> 02:17:24,504
Please wake up, Lord
