He had not come to buy goggles.

20
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:18,683
He had come to buy
a girl.And he took her.

21

Kumar.. son, where were you?.

48
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:39,093
I had gone to meet Prem.
- Okay.

49
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:41,928
He was not there..
so I went to meet Satish.

50
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:44,047
My other friends were also there.

51
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,569
We all together have given the BA exams.

52
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,904
Everybody has decided to do MA, father.

53
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,965
And this is what I too have decided.

54
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,058
First let your results come out.

55
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,605
You don"t worry about that.I
will surely pass.

56
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:02,984
And I will enrol
for MA in the next month.

57
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:08,287
I love it, father.- Good. Very good.

58
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:12,193
I have abundant work to do next month.

59
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:22,573
You want to enrol for MA.
I have to search a groom for Kamala.

60
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:43,279
"Dinanath, you have become very aged."

61
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,158
"Your eyesight too has become weak."

62
00:08:45,264 --> 00:08:47,277
"Many times you
have made mistakes in accounts."

63
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:57,972
"So you have to resign
from the job from the next month."

64
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,955
Sir has left. There he goes.

65
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:22,021
Sir!.

66
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:29,388
Sir, please increase it by another year.

67
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:33,657
Dinanath.. I am helpless.

68
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,503
But I am helpless. I
have to work at any cost.

69
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:42,387
I have a young daughter.
I have to get her married.

70
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,581
I have to pay for my son"s studies.

71
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,579
Apart from me there
is nobody else to earn.

72
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:50,093
Dinanath, now you can"t work.

73
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,026
You have become very aged.

74
00:09:52,498 --> 00:09:54,546
You frequently make mistakes.

75
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:57,682
Now there wont be any
mistake.I assure you.

76
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:02,653
I will toil. I will
toil,sir. I will toil.

77
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:08,213
Dinanath! Dinanath..it
is not about toil.

78
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:10,077
Your eyesight has become weak.

79
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:17,313
The office needs new people..young
people. I am helpless.

80
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:25,755
New people.. young people.

81
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:36,734
Sir, do me one favour. Appoint my
son in my place.

82
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:40,471
I will be indebted to
you.He has given his BA exams.

83
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:41,694
He will surely pass.

84
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:48,278
Fine. If he passes.. then
I will appoint him in your place.

Yes, father.

88
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,327
Son, come.

89
00:11:08,507 --> 00:11:09,622
Have a seat.

90
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:20,364
Son, I am sorry. But
you won"t be able to do MA.

91
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,619
I have found a job for you.

92
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:30,557
Father, this is even better.

93
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:32,221
I will do MA privately.

94
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:34,549
And now a days it is
so difficult to get a job.

95
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,464
Very good! Very good, son.

96
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:40,299

then you will get my post.

Father, my exams went
very well.I will surely pass.

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,212
Then I too will become
free from the responsibilities.

99
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,532
You and Chota will have to look after it.

100
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,777
I will get Kamala married.And
I will go to Kashi.

101
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:57,266
I will have to search a groom for her.

102
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,277
Father, we have already done that.

103
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:03,213
You have searched a groom for her?.
- Yes, father.

104
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,298

105
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:07,513

Kamala likes him. And he likes Kamala.

108
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:14,489
You just have a meeting with his mother.

109
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:19,839
Fine. Tomorrow I will
meet his mother. The guy is very nice.

God knows where
this Ramu has disappeared.

146
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:48,145
Accountant! Accountant!

147
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,163
Accountant!
- Yes.

148
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:03,530
Accountant!

149
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:07,151
Ma"am.. I dozed off.

150
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,104
You dozed off or you are in a stupor!

151
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,223
Since when you have
been asleep.Where is Ramu?.

152
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:15,040
Ramu.. he has gone
to buy hay for the horse.

153
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:16,432
Go and check who is at the door.

154
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:22,942
Elders have said
it right.Bosses only scold.

155
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:24,522
And servants have
to dance to their tunes.

156
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,548
Why were you ringing
the bell??What do you want?.

157
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:40,904
I want to meet Mr. Prem"s mother.

158
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:43,967
First you will have to
meet Mr. Prem"s accountant.

159
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:45,361
I am the accountant Kashiram.

160
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:55,042
Come.

161
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,925
Today I have come
to ask something from you.

162
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:06,087
My daughter Kamala..is very sensible.

163
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:08,029
She is educated.

164
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,113
If she gets the chance to serve you all..

165
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:14,934
..then I will consider myself as blessed.

166
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:19,123
Yes! Why not! She is educated!

167
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:23,193
You need a servant! Appoint her.

168
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:26,038
Accountant, you don"t understand.

169
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,403
He doesn"t have
brain.He only uses opium.

170
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,351
Ma"am, I swear on you.

171
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,071
Now a days you don"t get good opium.

172
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:34,557
Don"t say it to
anybody.I am in my senses.

173
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,151
Dinanath was twisting words.

174
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,161
My daughter has done FA.

175
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,235
She does the household chores very well.

176
00:17:43,335 --> 00:17:46,350
And she is looking
after our house, accountant.

177
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:50,101
Yes. Prem too always praises Kamala.

178
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,562
Then what is the matter?.

179
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:54,696
Tell me. What is the affair all about?.

180
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:58,446
I can only give the
girl.I don"t have anything else.

181
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,509
I wish the marriage
takes place next month.

182
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:07,236
I am suffering from BP fits.

183
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,091
If the daughter-in-law comes
to the house..

184
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:11,629
..I will be free of all worries.

185
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:15,053
I will fix the earliest auspicious date.

186
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,489
Prem.

187
00:18:46,665 --> 00:18:49,634
What"s the matter?.
Why are you looking so sad?.

188
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:51,748
Your father had come to our place.

189
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,126
Yes. What has been decided?.

190
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,219
Mother has rejected the marriage.

191
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:00,532
She has rejected.
- Yes.

192
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:04,309
Kamala, let us elope.
- Elope!

193
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,352
I was just kidding.

194
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,617
Mother has given her
consent for the marriage.

195
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:16,442
Really?.
- Yes.

196
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:55,653
""When you have held my hands.""

197
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:58,987
""Then do maintain the bond, beloved.""

198
00:20:01,106 --> 00:20:03,802
""Look, don"t forsake me.""

199
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:07,971
""When you have held my hands.""

200
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,334
""Then do maintain the bond, beloved.""

201
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:16,107
""Look, don"t forsake me.""

202
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,806
""l will never leave you.""

203
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:23,895
""Even if the world becomes my enemy.""

204
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:26,726
""Look, don"t forsake me.""

205
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:30,086
""Look, don"t break my heart.""

206
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:53,710
""The wedding procession is adorned
with flowers.""

207
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:56,294
""And the palanquin is adorned with buds.""

208
00:20:56,795 --> 00:21:00,379
""The wedding procession is adorned
with flowers.""

209
00:21:00,933 --> 00:21:03,754
""And the palanquin is adorned with buds.""

210
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:10,399
""l have become yours for the rest of
my life starting from today.""

211
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:14,162
""Starting from today.""

212
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,738
""l will keep the honour of
the marriage intact.""

213
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,978
""Give me the vow, beloved.""

214
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,835
""Look, don"t turn back on your words.""

215
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,325
""Look, don"t break my heart.""

216
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:55,844
""When the blue sky
will shower down on me.""

217
00:21:55,954 --> 00:22:02,974
""When the blue sky
will shower down on me.""

218
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:07,230
""l will always
maintain our bond of love.""

219
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:10,388
""l have always
maintained our bond of love.""

220
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,897
""l have always
maintained our bond of love.""

221
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:20,402
""Don"t tarnish the name
of love in the world, beloved.""

222
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:25,346
""Look, don"t break my heart.""

223
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:30,333
""l will never leave you.""

224
00:22:30,456 --> 00:22:33,425
""Even if the world becomes my enemy.""

225
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:36,327
""Look, don"t forsake me.""

226
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:39,990
""Look, don"t break my heart.""

227
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:07,878
Kamala, we will
get married according to the rituals.

228
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:10,976
But today with the twinkling stars
as the witness..

229
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:15,283
..beneath the dais of
the sky..in front of the temple..

230
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:21,531
..on the earth, l
take you my life partner.

231
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,538
And this is the wedding ornament.It
is a nice piece, sir.

232
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:48,024
I think this is good, Kumar.

233
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:50,980
Okay, father.

234
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:53,903
Then make one like this piece.

235
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:57,407
Only 1 month and 20
days are remaining for the wedding.

236
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:59,602
Sir, by that time I will make 20 things.

237
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,520
Accountant, this necklace will look
so good on Kamala.

238
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:18,858
I have lost my opium box.

239
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:23,147
Accountant!
- I have lost my opium box.

240
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,952
So I was thinking only about that.

241
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:27,423
What a beautiful necklace!

242
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:31,022
It will look so good on Kamala!

243
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:35,877
Wow, jeweller! You
and your necklace, both are great!

244
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:46,444
The attires are ready.

245
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,483
After 4 days, the
jewellery too will be ready.

246
00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:53,690
We have to order
more catering items for the guests.

247
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:59,467
I hope tomorrow your results are declared.
- Yes, father.

248
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:01,039
Then your job too will be confirmed.

249
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:04,196
There will be somebody
to look after the responsible.

250
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:05,792
Look, you are there.

251
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:08,129
So the arrangements
are been done so quickly.

252
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:09,627
First!

253
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,923
I am sorry.

254
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:35,665
It"s okay. It"s okay.

255
00:26:06,772 --> 00:26:07,796
Greetings, Biharilal.

256
00:26:07,907 --> 00:26:11,058
My son has passed.He has come first.

257
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:12,997
When will you give sweets?.

258
00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:15,808
In the evening. I
will bring Kumar along with me.

259
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:19,814
Kumar! Kumar!

260
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:21,975
Brother!

261
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,478
What happened?. What happened?.

262
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,823
Kumar, you have passed.
You have come first, Kumar!

263
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:44,124
You have come first! Kumar!

264
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:46,138
Brother!

265
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:53,573
Father! Father!

266
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:08,722
Dear, what has happened!
I am ruined, dear! I am ruined!

267
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:14,022
Kumar! Kumar!

268
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:16,856
Father!
- Kumar!

269
00:27:16,976 --> 00:27:21,527
Father! Father! Father!

270
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,918
Kamala, who has come?.

271
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:35,220
The doctor.
- Okay.

272
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:43,246
Will the bandage around my
eyes be removed today?.

273
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,484
I will do it just now.

274
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:33,798
My eyes!
- Father!

275
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,479
My eyes! My eyes!

276
00:28:37,489 --> 00:28:40,287
Father!
- Kamala!

277
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:45,386
Kumar died and I lost my eyesight.

278
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:52,127
Have patience.

279
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:58,228
Have patience, Kamala.Have patience.

280
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:07,343
Ma"am, if you get
Premmarried to Kamala..

281
00:29:07,453 --> 00:29:10,513
..then you will get
her blind father as dowry.

282
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:13,841
And that 1 2-1 3 years old Kishore will
also be dragged along.

283
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,312
Then look after both of them.

284
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,156
I don"t understand what to do.

285
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:20,322
Get Prem married to
some girl belonging to a nice family.

286
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:22,115
And get abundant dowry too.

287
00:29:22,835 --> 00:29:24,450
I don"t want dowry, accountant.

288
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,288
God has given us everything.

289
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:28,236
Yes. Only a blind man is needed.

290
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,228
Ma"am, remember.. once he comes here..

291
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:31,991
..nobody is going to respect you.

292
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:33,999
You think that Kashiram is a fool.

293
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:38,244
But let me tell you,elders have said..

294
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,942
..that relatives ruin the family.

295
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,374
Fine! I will get Prem
married to some other girl.

296
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:47,987
Mother.. I will marry only Kamala.

297
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:50,072
But who will look after her blind father?.
- I will do it.

298
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:51,788
Forgive me, Mr. Prem.

299
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:54,752
Kashiram always
thinks about your benefit.

300
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,300
And I will do that in future too.

301
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:58,893
Invite the blind manand feed two people.

302
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:00,767
Accountant, you keep quiet!- Okay.

303
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:03,433
Elders have said don"t
open your mouth in front of boss.

304
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,243
Mother, no matter what..I
will marry only Kamala.

305
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,241
Ma"am, shall I tell you something?.

306
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,819
When the children don"t pay heed to you..

307
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,311
..then the family will perish.

308
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,505
Accountant, what rubbish!

309
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:22,184
May my enemy"s family perish!

310
00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:23,454
I don"t care whom he marries!

311
00:30:25,331 --> 00:30:27,014
Greetings. Come.
- Greetings.

312
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:28,121
Come.

313
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:32,129
Are the jewelleries
ready?. - Yes. It"s ready.

314
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,198
Take this.

315
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:44,932
Look, this is the necklace.These
are the earrings.

316
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,747
And this is the ring.Keep it careful.

317
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:56,961
And these are the bracelets.Close it.

318
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:00,354
And these are the bangles.

319
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,149
It would have been better if you..

320
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,349
..had shown it to somebody.

321
00:31:04,937 --> 00:31:09,488
What are you
saying, Ramnath?. Don"t I trust you?.

322
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:10,961
It is your grace.

323
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:13,902
And here is the wedding ornament.

324
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,247
I wish I could see it.

325
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:29,349
Ramnath, I will leave now.

326
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:32,208
Greetings.
- Greetings.

327
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,158
Father!

328
00:31:51,383 --> 00:31:54,534
Dear, look where is
your wedding ornament.

329
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:58,809
Here it is. Father,Why did you go alone?.

330
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:02,481
Nothing, dear. I just went there.

331
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,256
I just went there.

332
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:12,070
Father, please don"t venture out alone.

333
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:17,963
Dear, gradually I have to get used to it.

334
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:21,331
How long will I depend on you?.

335
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:25,201
Till the time I am
there. Kishore,take care of father.

336
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:26,363
I will be back soon.

337
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:34,050
Father, if brother had been here..

338
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,377
..then you wouldn"t
have to wander around like this.

339
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,053
Son, then why would I have become blind?.

340
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:45,331
You have become
blind.Brother is no more.

341
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,165
Sister too will go after marriage.

342
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:52,135
What a grave trouble this is!

343
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:56,908
Father, who will earn
money??Who will cook?.

344
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,244
We both will do it, son.

345
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:05,544
No! I will do it! I
will give up my studies!

346
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:08,149
But I won"t let you face any hardship.

347
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,378
I will work and earn whatever I can.

348
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,590
Kishore! Kishore, my son! No!

349
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:23,269
I will educate you!
I will look after you!

350
00:33:24,176 --> 00:33:26,997

Has this ever happened?.

390
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:59,569
Daughters belong to the in-laws.

391
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,375
Dear, you don"t worry about us.

392
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:06,830
Our happiness lies in your happiness.

393
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:09,218
And it is my duty to look after you.

394
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:13,669
It is my duty to
educate Kishore and make him capable.

395
00:37:14,306 --> 00:37:16,774
Father, I won"t marry now.

396
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:20,276
Dear, don"t do this.
You will have to get married.

397
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:23,348
No, father. Till
the time Kishore doesn"t..

398
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,667
..become independent,l
won"t get married.

399
00:37:25,784 --> 00:37:27,172
I won"t do it!

400
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:35,705
No, Prem. Till the
time my brother doesn"t..

401
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,841
..become independent, I can"t marry.

402
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:43,224
Kamala! Kamala, you
don"t worry about Kishore.

403
00:37:43,335 --> 00:37:44,802
I will take care of his education.

404
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:47,464
And I will also make him independent.

405
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:54,728
But I have to look
after father too. He is blind.

406
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:56,712
My eyes are his eyes, Kamala.

407
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:58,680
We will keep him with us.

408
00:37:58,784 --> 00:38:03,744
No, Prem. He won"t do
this.I know him very well.

409
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:07,711
He won"t come to
his daughter"s in-law"s house.

410
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:12,193
Prem, give me the duration of 7-8 years.

411
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:15,653
I want to mend my father"sbroken heart.

412
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:19,292
Till the time Kishore doesn"t grow up..

413
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:20,793
..I want to serve him as Kumar.

414
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:23,374
But Kamala..
- Don"t force your Kamala.

415
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:27,523
I am yours. And I will remain yours.

416
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:31,434
Get up. My happiness
lies in your happiness.

417
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:39,302
Ma"am, elders have
said, don"t procrastinate today"s work.

418
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,780
1 2 years ago.. my wife had
got a heart attack in the night.

419
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,331
She died in the morning.

420
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,305
She loved me so much.

421
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:02,302
No! Now I won"t get married.

422
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,735
Keep quiet! I am
not talk ingabout your marriage!

423
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,681
I am talking about Prem"s marriage.

424
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:12,753
Ma"am, you too get BP
fits.May I go to hell!

425
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:17,454
If before Prem"s marriage..

426
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:23,934
something happened to you..

427
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:26,402
..then his house will be ruined.

428
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:30,657
Accountant! I will
get him married on the fixed date!

429
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,525
He is mad!

430
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:36,376
Kamala, you are
mad! Kishore..come with me.

431
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:38,370
The marriage will take
place on the fixed date.

432
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:39,769
The marriage will take
place on the fixed date.

433
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:42,409
The marriage will take
place on the fixed date.

434
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,410
Yes! Yes! The marriage
will take place on the fixed date.

435
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,845
I have come to say this.Kamala is mad.

436
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,975
Kamala is not mad. She is making us mad!

437
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:52,931
She has made my son mad!

438
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:57,586
She can wait for 7 years!But
I can"t wait! Get lost!

439
00:39:57,703 --> 00:39:59,716
I will get Prem
married to some other girl!

440
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:02,033
Don"t do this! Don"t do this!

441
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,899
My daughter"s life will
be ruined!I will explain to her.

442
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,980
You don"t worry. I
will marry only Kamala.

443
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:13,044

Accountant, you keep quiet!- Okay.

445

Prem! You will have
to get married on the same date!

446
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,308
Mother, I won"t change my
mind. Father, come.

447
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:25,475
Prem!
- I will be back soon!

448
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,427
Disrespecting mother!How
times have changed!

449
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,468
I can"t see this! God,
I don"t want to live any more.

450
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:43,435
I will be grateful.

Dear, I am depending
on you.Take care of my daughter.

453
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,576
Father, you don"t worry.

454
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:59,459
Kishore, take father home carefully.

455
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:14,593
Prem!
- Yes.

456
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,571
So you will marry Kamala?.

457
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,564
Yes, mother. I have given her the oath.

458
00:41:20,052 --> 00:41:23,237
What oath! To marry after my death!

459
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,937
Mother, don"t say this.
I would have got married now.

460
00:41:26,058 --> 00:41:27,173
But I am helpless.

461
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,339
Even I am helpless.

462
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,520
For your happiness, l
refused the proposal from good families.

463

it that you get married!

If you didn"t listen to
me,then I will kill myself.

471
00:41:49,648 --> 00:41:52,014
Don"t kill me by making me
so helpless, mother.

Don"t ruin my life.

00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:36,808
""Where have my days gone??'"

525
00:48:51,003 --> 00:48:52,288
Kamala.

526
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:54,928
Prem!

527
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,837
Kamala.. mother forced me to get married.

528
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:11,916
Prem, I have no
complains and grievances from you.

529
00:49:13,025 --> 00:49:16,358
I didn"t marry because of my father.

530
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:18,555
You got married because of your mother.

531
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:23,420
Yes, Kamala. But I love only you.
- Prem!

532
00:49:27,306 --> 00:49:30,457
Our love was not meant to last for long.

533
00:49:32,144 --> 00:49:34,999
It was like a dream of a pauper who
wants to own the palace.

534
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,569
It broke.

535
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,243
No, Kamala. Our love
was not a dream. It is real.

536
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:43,413
It is eternal. For my whole life l
will wait for that true love.

537
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:47,912
True love begins after marriage.

538
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:52,281
It contains trust and bondage, Prem.

539
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:00,392
Kamala, this marriage is my helplessness.

540
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:03,994
Helplessness gives
only sorrow,not happiness.

541
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:07,089
Kamala, I am sad. I need your love.

542
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,044
I love only you, Kamala.

543
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:12,606
Not l, but your wife deserves your love.

544
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:14,973
You should love only her!

545
00:50:15,087 --> 00:50:17,373
Kamala!
- Prem!

546
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:22,615
Recognize yourself.
You are a married man.

547
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,986
You shouldn"t hold my
hands.You should hold her hands.

548
00:50:26,098 --> 00:50:28,419
You should fulfil the duty of a husband.

549
00:50:30,102 --> 00:50:34,198
I beg you. Go back to her.

550
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:45,247
And give her this ring..on my behalf.

551
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:51,685
Prem.

552
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:42,360
Shyama, look at me. Look at me.

553
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:56,203
This house.. it"s
wall.. everything is yours, Shyama.

554
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:04,183
My heart too..
- Why did you stop?.

555
00:52:04,296 --> 00:52:12,203
Shyama, my heart is like the bird
who is forced to fly.

556
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:16,341
Before settling down,its
wings are broken.

557
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,704
Shyama, my heart is wounded.

558
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:20,690
I don"t understand.

559
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:24,580
Ignorance is bliss. Forget it.

560
00:52:25,484 --> 00:52:29,147
Wear this ring.
- You only do it.

561
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:38,375
Why did you stop?.

562
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,225
Go ahead.

563
00:52:43,335 --> 00:52:47,760
Kamala.
- Kamala! Who is this Kamala?.

564
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,197
Forgive me, Shyama. Give,
I will put the ring on your finger.

565
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:55,166
No! First tell me who is this Kamala?.

566
00:52:56,348 --> 00:52:58,748
I lost her and came to you.

567
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:01,819
In her dejection, I became yours.

568
00:53:04,256 --> 00:53:06,508
You ruined my life.You
turned my happiness to ashes.

569
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:14,248
Tell me! Why didn"t you
tell me that he loves somebody else!

570
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:18,358
Daughter-in-law,
love doesn"t satiate hunger.

571
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:23,521
This huge house,
wealth, fame..everything is yours.

572
00:53:23,642 --> 00:53:25,291
You mean to say that
I have married this house!

573
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,208
I have married the wealth!

574
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:30,441
No! No! When did I say
this??You have married only Prem.

575
00:53:31,283 --> 00:53:32,762
He will not be mine, accountant!

576
00:53:34,387 --> 00:53:36,184
And a woman doesn"t
want wealth and riches.

577
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:37,403
She desires her husband"s love!

578
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:39,616
And I will never get that in my life.

579
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:43,317
Daughter-in-law, l
have drugs. I drink.

580
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,444
But then I become stable.

581
00:53:46,565 --> 00:53:50,228
Similarly Prem"s intoxication will
automatically sober down.

582
00:53:50,336 --> 00:53:53,225
Keep quiet, accountant.
What do you know about love!

583
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:55,830
Daughter-in-law,
whatever I have done..

584
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,260
..that is good for both of you.

585
00:53:57,376 --> 00:54:00,345
Daughter-in-law,
elders have said that..

586
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,879
..elders always do the right thing.

587
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:04,474
And what younger people
do,that too is right!

588
00:54:07,653 --> 00:54:08,768
This is the limit!

589
00:54:09,422 --> 00:54:11,890
Ma"am, daughter-in-law is
very hot tempered.

590
00:54:13,092 --> 00:54:15,185
God bless you. How
will you live with her?.

591
00:54:15,928 --> 00:54:20,319
I have ruined my old
age by getting them married.

592
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:28,994
Father, I am leaving.

593
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:34,029
Dear, my life
becomes death sentence to you.

594
00:54:34,847 --> 00:54:36,041
Father, what are you saying?.

595
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,663
Dear, I am right. I am right.

596
00:54:40,853 --> 00:54:45,813
You have sacrificed my
life for me. I am unfortunate, dear.

597
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:49,383
You have to work to feed me.

598
00:54:49,962 --> 00:54:52,430
Father, it is my fortunes.

599
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:58,289
And then.. not only for
you..I am working for Kishore too.

600
00:54:58,871 --> 00:55:00,350
I have to educate him.

601
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:03,237
Father, he only will be our support.

602
00:55:04,977 --> 00:55:08,731
I will leave now.
- Okay, dear.

603
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,209
Met Kamala?. She will
be very sad without you.

604
00:55:17,323 --> 00:55:19,814
How many times I have told you not
to talk to me like this!

605
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:22,211
Why?. What did I say?.

606
00:55:22,328 --> 00:55:24,796
I just asked whether you met Kamala.

607
00:55:24,897 --> 00:55:25,886
You are mad!

608
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:28,925
If I was not mad then you would..

609
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,149
..have left me and gone to her.

610
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:32,851
You married one woman
and you love another woman!

611
00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:34,132
Shyama, use your senses!

612
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:37,025
I don"t have any relation with Kamala!

613
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:39,839
I don"t have any
ties with her! Believe me!

614
00:55:39,979 --> 00:55:43,312
Yes! I should believe
you!So that you can meet her!

615
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:45,349
I am not a fool!

616
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:47,976
Now either she will
live in this city or me!

617
00:55:48,087 --> 00:55:49,952
If this is your obstinacy,then we will..

618
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,852
..Ieave the city tomorrow.

619
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:00,896
Accountant, sit.

620
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,151
What to do?. Elder shave said it right.

621
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,953
If a woman wants, she can convert..

622
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,289
..the house into
heaven..or convert it into hell.

623
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,965
Since the time ShyamaDevi has arrived..

624
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:11,941
..the house has become hell.

625
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,880
If Kamala had come,
then it would have been great!

626
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:17,369
The family is ruined!

627
00:56:17,483 --> 00:56:22,386
Mr. Prem has left the city.
He took his wife along with him too.

628
00:56:22,488 --> 00:56:26,117
His mother is staying alone.Elders
have said it right.

629
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:29,558
My wishes are different and God"s
wills are different.

630
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:32,153
What had ma"am thought and
what has happened?.

631
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,879
Dear, give me tea.

632
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,187
Kamala dear, get tea for the accountant.
- Okay.

633
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:49,244

8th. Very good! Very good!

00:56:55,187 --> 00:56:59,283
Dinanath, give me
this child. I have a niece.

637
00:56:59,392 --> 00:57:02,361
She is very beautiful. She
is very talented. She is very sensible.

638
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:08,263
Accountant.. he still
has to achieve many things in life.

639
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:12,923
With a sister like Kamala,
all the destinations will become easy.

640
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:16,439
I will get him married..to my niece.
- Fine.

641
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,413
Accountant, take this.

642
00:57:23,115 --> 00:57:26,448
Dear, I have
fixed everything with your father.

643
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:29,134
I will get Kishore married to my niece.

644
00:57:29,255 --> 00:57:31,052
You look after
his education,get him married..

645
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:34,456
..then you can live your life peacefully.

646
00:57:37,129 --> 00:57:39,051
Accountant, he is everything for us.

647
00:57:40,232 --> 00:57:44,862
To make his life a success..I can
even give up my life.

648
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:03,079
Go directly to school.

649
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:05,384
And come home directly from the school.
- Okay.

650
00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:40,639
Greetings, Kamala.
- Greetings, master.

651
00:58:40,759 --> 00:58:42,112
Is Kishore not well?.

652
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,446
He has not been attending school for
the past 3-4 days.

653
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:48,499
He is not attending
school??Then where does he go?.

654
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:53,333
Hit this.

655
00:58:56,508 --> 00:58:57,941
Oh God!

656
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:04,936
Let"s go. Time to go.
- Okay.

657
00:59:26,238 --> 00:59:29,696
Where are you coming
from?. - From the school.

658
00:59:29,808 --> 00:59:34,040
From the school! From the school!
- Sister! Sister!

659
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:36,194
You lie to me! You lie to me!

660
00:59:57,236 --> 00:59:59,727
Sister! Sister!

661
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:05,106
Sister, now I will go to school every
day. Sister, I lied to you.

662
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:08,066
Hit me! Hit me more! Hit me more!

663
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:11,331
No, Kishore! No, Kishore!

664
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:15,646
Kishore! Kishore!

665
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,112
Kamala!

666
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,452
Kishore!
- Yes, father.

667
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:29,724
Since when I was
calling you.What were you doing?.

668
01:00:30,202 --> 01:00:33,694
Where is Kamala?.
- I am here, father.

669
01:00:34,306 --> 01:00:38,663
Why are both of your voices so heavy?.

670
01:00:41,213 --> 01:00:44,137
Father, my mouth was full of sweets.

671
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,571
Sister gave me sweets to eat.

672
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:52,109
Okay. Okay. Kamala,
you got the invitation.

673
01:00:52,224 --> 01:00:55,682
Yes, father. Tomorrow is"Bhai Dooj".
- Take this.

674
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:58,220
Give.

675
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:14,568
Kishore, take 2
rupees.Today is "Bhai Dooj".

676
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,511
Give it as a gift to Kamala.

677
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:20,130
No, father. You want me
to give sister"s earning back to her.

678
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:24,109
I will give her the gift when
I will grow up and I will start earning.

679
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,486
Son! God bless you, son!

680
01:01:55,755 --> 01:01:58,576
This is for the past 6 years.And
this is for this year.

681
01:02:00,392 --> 01:02:02,257
Brother, you have repaid all the debt.

682
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,323
Sister, even after
taking birth for 7 lifetimes..

683
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,456
..I can"t repay your favour.

684
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:12,497
You sacrificed
your happiness for my sake.

685
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:15,221
You sacrificed your life for me.

686
01:02:15,341 --> 01:02:17,320
Kishore, this was my duty.

687
01:02:17,743 --> 01:02:24,239
Seeing you independent..
onlyl know how joyful I am feeling.

688
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:27,808
And only I know how sad I am feeling.

689
01:02:30,423 --> 01:02:33,347
Instead of passing BA and getting a job..

690
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:36,348
..it would have been better
ifl had to lead a harsh life..

691
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:40,796
..and visit your houseand
call you as sister.

692
01:02:40,899 --> 01:02:43,265
Feeling pity for me,
you would have shed tears.

693
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:48,272
Kishore, you are crying!Wipe your tears.

694
01:02:48,374 --> 01:02:51,343
Instead of wiping my
tears, sister think. There is still time.

695
01:02:51,443 --> 01:02:53,604
Find a life partner for yourself..
- Kishore!

696
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:59,182
Have you changed your
mind?. I have got my niece"s photo.

697
01:02:59,785 --> 01:03:03,414
Kishore has grown up.
He has completed his education.

698
01:03:03,522 --> 01:03:05,535
He has started earning.

699
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:07,614
That"s why I have come
to talk about his marriage.

700
01:03:07,726 --> 01:03:09,375
When do you want to get him married?.

701
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:12,558
You will have to talk
to father about his marriage.

702
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:15,634
I am such a fool! I
am talking to children!

703
01:03:15,734 --> 01:03:16,894
Where is Dinanath?.

704
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:20,324
Accountant, I am
here.- Greetings, Dinanath.

705
01:03:20,439 --> 01:03:24,671
I have got my niece"s
snap. Her name is Tara. Have a look.

706
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,563
I wish I could see, accountant.

707
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:35,686
I am such a fool! Dear,
you have a look and tell me.

708
01:03:35,788 --> 01:03:39,212
If she likes her, thenl
too have no qualms.

709
01:03:40,392 --> 01:03:41,472
Father, I like her.

710
01:03:41,594 --> 01:03:43,721
Accountant, then the marriage is fixed.

711
01:03:44,396 --> 01:03:47,320
Do you like her?.

712
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:49,958
Sister, if you like
her then I too like her.

713
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:00,308
Bhabhi, may you always remain married!

714
01:04:00,412 --> 01:04:06,282
Brother, God bless you.
God has fulfilled my wish. Come.

715
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,989
Father, shall I make tea?.

716
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:21,327
Not now,
daughter-in-law.

717
01:04:21,434 --> 01:04:23,652
Let Kamala and Kishore too return
from the office.

718
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:28,363
Sister has still not returned?. - No.

719
01:04:28,474 --> 01:04:31,728
Kishore, do you know
why Kamala is so late today?.

720
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,405
Sister has returned.

721
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,308
Sister, you are not well?.

722
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:50,657
Kishore, I am fine.
There was too much workload.

723
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:53,778
Sister, I have told you
so many times. Resign from the job.

724
01:04:53,899 --> 01:04:57,414
Yes, sister. Now you don"t need to work.

725
01:04:57,536 --> 01:05:00,721
He is there and you
are working.It looks so bad.

726
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:04,024
What harm is there?. I
will work as long as I can.

727
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:07,032
No, dear. Now you don"t need to work.

728
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:09,401
Now you sit at home peacefully.

729
01:05:09,515 --> 01:05:11,494
Father, I tell her everyday.But she
doesn"t listen to me.

730
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:12,641
Look, sister. I
don"t mind if you feel bad.

731
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:14,013
But now I won"t let you work.

732
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,678
I will write
the resignation letter today itself.

733
01:05:16,922 --> 01:05:18,082
Accountant.
- Yes.

734
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,384
No need to come from tomorrow onwards.

735
01:05:19,492 --> 01:05:22,347
Why, ma"am?. I am not sick.

736
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:23,485
No, accountant.

737
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:25,976
But there is no need for you to come
to work from tomorrow onwards.

738
01:05:26,098 --> 01:05:28,464
But why?. For what will I be paid?.

739
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:30,559
I will give you the salary today.

740
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,922
But from tomorrow
onwards,you will not come to work.

741
01:05:33,038 --> 01:05:36,018
Sacked from job! Ma"am,don"t do this!

742
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:43,127
I will be ruined! I
have served your family.

743
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:47,003
Now at this age where will I wander?.

744
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:53,922
Ma"am, I swear on you. I
won"t have drugs. I swear. Forgive me.

745
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:57,041
Accountant, you can have
as much drugs as you want.

746
01:05:57,163 --> 01:06:00,860
I am going to Kashi. I
plan to stay there only.

747
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,237
Tara!
- Uncle!

748
01:06:24,056 --> 01:06:26,251
Uncle!
- Dear!

749
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:31,291
Uncle, why have you brought the luggage?.

750
01:06:31,397 --> 01:06:34,582
I need a place to keep
it and a she lter for myself.

751
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:38,616
I have lost my job. I
have come to stay at your place.

752
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:44,372
Dear, you have become
quiet.I will go away.

753
01:06:44,477 --> 01:06:48,629
Uncle! Uncle, why are
you leaving?. It is your house.

754
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:52,050
You can live here
and share our meagre meals.

755
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:54,107
God bless you, dear. God bless you.

756
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,541
You said what my niece should have said.

757
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:58,250
Elders have said it right.

758
01:06:58,357 --> 01:07:00,154
During difficult times,
our kin become strangers..

759
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:02,090
..and strangers become kin.

760
01:07:03,262 --> 01:07:09,280
I will reside in this small room.

761
01:07:25,518 --> 01:07:28,646
Oh no! The opium is over!

762
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:32,042
Accountant, opium is not good.

763
01:07:32,158 --> 01:07:33,273
Why don"t you give it up?.

764
01:07:36,462 --> 01:07:37,656
Dinanath, now I will have to give it up.

765
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,588
Now there is no income.

766
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:46,426
Father, I am going to the market.

767
01:07:46,539 --> 01:07:49,337
Do you need anything?.
- Dear, I don"t want anything.

768
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,206
Kamala dear, from today onwards l
will go to the market.

769
01:07:54,313 --> 01:07:56,406
Uncle, why do you take the trouble?.

770
01:07:56,516 --> 01:07:58,564
Dear, there is no trouble in this.

771
01:07:58,684 --> 01:08:00,208
Elders have said
that elders and youngsters..

772
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,446
..everybody in the house should work.

773
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:05,615
And it is my rule. No work, no food.

774
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:07,043
Give me the bag and the money.

775
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:08,114
I will bring the grocery.

776
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:17,420
Tell me, dear.

777
01:08:18,271 --> 01:08:21,422
1 rupee sugar, 2
rupees lentil,50 cents coriander.

778
01:08:22,274 --> 01:08:29,191
1 rupee sugar.. 2 rupees lentil..

779
01:08:29,315 --> 01:08:33,263
50 cents coriander.

780
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:40,613
1 rupee.. 75 cents
sugar.1.50 rupees lentils.

781
01:08:40,726 --> 01:08:42,205
And 25 cents coriander.

782
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:48,766
Hello.
- Accountant, come.

783
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:53,104
Give me opium for 2
rupees.- Buy some more.

784
01:08:53,205 --> 01:08:56,185
If you give it to me on credit,then
I will surely take it.

785
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:59,503
I am going through bad times.

786
01:08:59,612 --> 01:09:02,433
Somehow I have saved 2 rupees and got it.
- Okay.

787
01:09:09,322 --> 01:09:11,210
Sugar doesn"t seem to be of 1 rupees.

788
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:14,154
Uncle wouldn"t have got less quantity.

789
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:19,456
Even the lentils" quantity
is less.I had asked for 2 rupees.

790
01:09:19,565 --> 01:09:21,578
Even the salt"s quantity is less.

791
01:09:25,237 --> 01:09:27,068
And coriander too is less.

792
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:31,130
I am not deaf!

793
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:33,803
I have done deals of lakhs of rupees!

794
01:09:34,213 --> 01:09:36,135
Nobody ever pointed his fingers on me!

795
01:09:36,249 --> 01:09:38,615
Today I got the grocery of 5rupees.
And I have become a thief.

796
01:09:39,251 --> 01:09:41,719
No, no. When did I say this?.

797
01:09:41,821 --> 01:09:44,472
It is possible
that the shopkeeper conned you.

798
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,205
Or maybe I am mistaken.

799
01:09:46,325 --> 01:09:50,352
No, no! I am a thief! I will not even
drink water in this house!

800
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,487
I am leaving.

801
01:09:51,597 --> 01:09:53,610
Uncle, I won"t allow you to leave.

802
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:57,191
I know that you can"t do this. Come.

803
01:10:06,378 --> 01:10:10,826
Today sister insulted uncle.- Sister?.

804
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:13,310
Yes. First she told him to
go and buy groceries.

805
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,375
And then she accused him.

806
01:10:15,488 --> 01:10:17,581
She said that the
groceriesare less in quantity.

807
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,817
If sister said it, then it must be less.

808
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,738
You mean to say that my uncle is a thief.

809
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:24,182
I didn"t say this.
- Sister says this.

810
01:10:24,296 --> 01:10:26,344
If sister says it, then it might be true.

811
01:10:26,966 --> 01:10:28,319
If what sister says, that is true..

812
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:29,696
..then what I say that too is true.

813
01:10:29,802 --> 01:10:30,826
Sister herself is a thief!

814
01:10:30,936 --> 01:10:32,324
Beware if you called sister as thief!

815
01:10:33,406 --> 01:10:34,486
I will not spare you!

816
01:10:34,607 --> 01:10:38,634
Fine! I am a thief!My uncle is a thief!

817
01:10:38,744 --> 01:10:40,575
I have come here only to be humiliated!

818
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:53,612
Father.. the matter
has become so serious.

819
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:58,150
I didn"t say
anything.Tara misunderstood me.

820
01:10:59,432 --> 01:11:02,230
Why are you sad for
this trivial matter, dear?.

821
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:07,853
Father, at times a spark
is all it needs to burn a fire.

822
01:11:09,775 --> 01:11:11,754
I don"t know what
Kishore must be thinking.

823
01:11:11,878 --> 01:11:15,735
You sacrificed your
life on your brother..

824
01:11:15,848 --> 01:11:18,578
..he will never think bad about you.

825
01:11:20,453 --> 01:11:23,820
Firstly daughter-in-law won"tsay
anything like this.

826
01:11:23,923 --> 01:11:27,780
Even if she says, will Kishore listen
to anything against you?.

827
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:43,423
I have kept the tea.

828
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:48,625
I think you are still angry with me.

829
01:11:48,748 --> 01:11:53,503
With whom do I get infuriated?.
- Me. Who else?.

830
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:56,643
You wanted to thrash me.

831
01:11:56,756 --> 01:11:58,144
Now next you will pluck out my eyes.

832
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:02,816
These eyes?. These
eyes brighten my life, Tara.

833
01:12:03,262 --> 01:12:05,310
Now let it be.

834
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:07,831
Today I will tell uncle to leave.
- Why?.

835
01:12:08,367 --> 01:12:11,188
Sister doesn"t like his staying here.

836
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:13,134
She was complaining to father last night.

837
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:20,745
I don"t understand
why sister is doing this.

838
01:12:22,715 --> 01:12:26,651
I myself can"t understand.- Forget it.

839
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:31,461
Motaram, give me 1 kg opium.- Okay.

840
01:14:31,577 --> 01:14:34,978
You can sell this glass.
- Okay.

841
01:14:36,215 --> 01:14:38,467
Dear, are you going to the market?.
- Yes.

842
01:14:38,584 --> 01:14:40,950
Go and sell this.
- Okay.

843
01:15:07,146 --> 01:15:10,115
I don"t understand
how these vessels got stolen.

844
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:15,110
As far as I know,
no stranger comes to the house.

845
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:19,120
Even the family
member couldn"thave stolen it.

846
01:15:19,959 --> 01:15:21,972
The family member can"t steal it.

847
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:23,482
And outsiders can"t come inside.

848
01:15:24,063 --> 01:15:26,429
Still things have
been stolen.That is strange!

849
01:15:26,532 --> 01:15:27,794
The house couldn"t have devoured it.

850
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:33,165
Elders have said it right.

851
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:37,905
During bad times kin becomes our enemy.

852
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:40,808
Am I right, Kamala dear?.

853
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,447
Father.. I will go
and get medicine for you.

854
01:15:50,556 --> 01:15:51,841
Okay, dear.

855
01:15:54,093 --> 01:15:55,560
We hardly manage to
make both the ends meet.

856
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:57,947
On top of that
stealing, aliments.I am fed up!

857
01:15:59,465 --> 01:16:01,956
Son, don"t spend on my ailment.

858
01:16:02,068 --> 01:16:04,047
I will get well on my own.

859
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,523
You are getting the medicines.

860
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,386
No matter how much we do for him..

861
01:16:09,508 --> 01:16:10,532
.still we have to listen to taunts!

862
01:16:10,643 --> 01:16:12,258
Daughter-in-law,
how did I taunt you?.

863
01:16:12,378 --> 01:16:15,074
No, you give us
blessings.I know everything.

864
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:27,923
Elders have said you can"t hide robbery.

865
01:16:28,027 --> 01:16:30,040
Kamala"s face clearly revealed..

866
01:16:30,162 --> 01:16:32,141
..that she is the one who steals vessels.

867
01:16:32,264 --> 01:16:35,188
Everybody was
talking.Only she was quiet.

868
01:16:35,301 --> 01:16:38,930
Yes, uncle she was so quiet.

869
01:16:39,038 --> 01:16:40,426
Kamala is very cunning.

870
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:45,076
She is selling the household things
and collecting money.

871
01:16:45,177 --> 01:16:48,066
She knows that if she
wants to leave from here..

872
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,898
..then she needs money for that.

873
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,107
Tara!

874
01:16:53,285 --> 01:16:56,209
At least use your charms on him.

875
01:16:56,322 --> 01:17:00,918
Keep money with you
only. Go.- Okay, uncle.

876
01:17:08,734 --> 01:17:10,258
Today you have come
early from the office.

877
01:17:10,369 --> 01:17:11,984
Today is Saturday.

878
01:17:15,508 --> 01:17:17,556
Take the money. Give it to sister.

879
01:17:18,077 --> 01:17:19,999
I will keep it.

880
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:24,446
Fine, you keep it. If
sister asks for money, give it to her.

881
01:17:25,084 --> 01:17:30,351
Okay. Listen! I want a ring.

882
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:34,348
I will get your name engraved on it.

883
01:17:35,194 --> 01:17:38,174
Fine. I will get it for you.- When?.

884
01:17:38,297 --> 01:17:41,425
Whenever you say.
- Today.

885
01:17:42,067 --> 01:17:43,591
Fine. We will go today in the evening.

886
01:17:58,217 --> 01:18:00,947
Show a nice ring for her.
- Okay.

887
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:27,703
How did you get these vessels?.

888
01:18:27,813 --> 01:18:28,928
A girl came to sell it.

889
01:18:31,818 --> 01:18:33,103
Do you know her?.

890
01:18:33,219 --> 01:18:36,734
I don"t know her. She
must be around 25-26 years old.

891
01:18:36,856 --> 01:18:40,075
It must be sister. She
only has the cupboard keys.

892
01:18:40,192 --> 01:18:44,708
Keep quiet! How much for all these?.
- 50 rupees.

893
01:18:49,902 --> 01:18:51,062
Take this.

894
01:18:59,278 --> 01:19:03,965
Tara.. I will buy a ring for you in the next month.
- Okay.

895
01:19:19,899 --> 01:19:20,979
Kishore!

896
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:26,820
What have you brought form the market?.

897
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:30,887
The vessels were stolen.I
have bought some more.

898
01:19:31,911 --> 01:19:33,503
You should
have brought something for Tara.

899
01:19:33,612 --> 01:19:35,204
I am more concerned about the house.

900
01:19:37,383 --> 01:19:40,204
Fine. Give, I will keep it.

901
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:42,970
Why?. You want to sell it again?.

902
01:19:43,856 --> 01:19:44,880
Tara!

903
01:19:44,991 --> 01:19:47,812
Can"t you keep quiet?. Go away!

904
01:19:51,197 --> 01:19:53,848
Kishore, what was Tara saying?.

905
01:19:53,966 --> 01:19:55,797
You want to sell it again!

906
01:19:56,969 --> 01:19:59,130
Am I being suspected of robbery?.

907
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:01,952
Sister, I don"t want
totalk anything about this.

908
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:03,837
And I don"t want to
hear anything.Just end the matter!

909
01:20:03,943 --> 01:20:04,989
But Kishore..

910
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:07,124
I told you to end it!
Why are you not letting it go?.

911
01:20:20,026 --> 01:20:26,226
Tara.. sister can do
this..I had never thought!

912
01:20:30,102 --> 01:20:33,162
You will ruin your health by thinking
so much about sister.

913
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:38,795
Let it be. Quickly drink your tea.

914
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:40,196
The show is about to begin.

915
01:20:42,682 --> 01:20:44,035
Tara, I will not go to the theatre.

916
01:20:47,153 --> 01:20:51,783
Let"s go. There are
so many troubles in the house.

917
01:20:52,692 --> 01:20:55,058
For an hour or two
we will have a nice time.

918
01:20:58,664 --> 01:20:59,824
Let"s go.

919
01:21:03,035 --> 01:21:06,220
You get ready. I
will go and get the coat.

920
01:21:11,644 --> 01:21:15,136
Kishore! Kishore,l need some rupees.

921
01:21:15,715 --> 01:21:17,194
I need to buy father"s medicine.

922
01:21:17,717 --> 01:21:19,548
Take it from Tara.

923
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:33,946
Tara.. give me 5 rupees.

924
01:21:34,066 --> 01:21:35,681
I need to buy medicine for father.

925
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:39,225
I don"t have money! Your brother bought
vessels for 50 rupees!

926
01:21:39,739 --> 01:21:41,604
And the whole month is left.

927
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:47,190
You don"t have some
money for the medicine.

928
01:21:47,747 --> 01:21:50,966
You must be having it.Use your money.

929
01:21:51,851 --> 01:21:54,979
Tara, I don"t have money.
- Even I don"t have it!

930
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:12,929
Dear, I have heard that
you are going to watch a show.

931
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:16,133
Yes, uncle. Will you come?.

932
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:42,619
Who is it?. Kamala?.

933
01:22:44,804 --> 01:22:45,884
Yes, father.

934
01:22:47,073 --> 01:22:48,119
Dear, you got the medicine?.

935
01:22:58,317 --> 01:23:01,741
Yes, father.
- Then give it to me.

936
01:23:19,939 --> 01:23:22,157
Give, dear.

937
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:52,189
Father, take.

962
01:28:17,603 --> 01:28:24,520
Kamala! Kamala dear!

963
01:28:27,713 --> 01:28:28,759
Coming, father.

964
01:28:35,855 --> 01:28:36,879
Yes, father.

965
01:28:37,757 --> 01:28:41,011
Dear, what"s the
matter?. Did anybody say anything?.

966
01:28:42,662 --> 01:28:44,129
No, father.

967
01:28:44,764 --> 01:28:47,688
I am sure that you
are hiding something from me.

968
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,028
Tell me, what is the matter?.

969
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:58,768
Nothing, father. Father,
I was wondering.. to start working again.

970
01:29:00,179 --> 01:29:04,604
Work?. No, dear. Iwon"t let you work!

971
01:29:04,717 --> 01:29:07,208
Already you are facing so many hardships.

972
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,606
Now I won"t let you work, dear.

973
01:29:18,798 --> 01:29:20,811
Sister didn"t eat the
food that I had prepared.

974
01:29:20,933 --> 01:29:22,889
She wants to cook her own meals.

975
01:29:36,816 --> 01:29:38,943
Initially, only the vessels used to
disappear from the house.

976
01:29:39,051 --> 01:29:40,040
Now jewelleries too
have started vanishing.

977
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,244
I can"t find my ring.

978
01:29:53,399 --> 01:29:56,584
My necklace has disappeared! Iam
sure that sister stole it!

979
01:30:08,181 --> 01:30:09,978
Sister! Where is Tara"s necklace?.

980
01:30:10,082 --> 01:30:13,006
Necklace?.
- Yes, necklace! And ring too!

981
01:30:14,754 --> 01:30:16,221
Kishore, what do I know?.

982
01:30:16,322 --> 01:30:18,813
You do know the shop
where you had sold it, don"t you?.

983
01:30:19,992 --> 01:30:21,880
Kishore.. what
is daughter-in-law saying?.

984
01:30:21,994 --> 01:30:23,109
She is right!

985
01:30:23,229 --> 01:30:24,787
You mean to say that Kamala is a thief!

986
01:30:24,897 --> 01:30:26,615
Yes, she is a thief!
- Kishore!

987
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:29,985
Aren"t you ashamed to accuse her!

988
01:30:30,736 --> 01:30:33,796
The sister who endured
so many hardships for your happiness..

989
01:30:33,906 --> 01:30:37,808
..who ruined her own
life to give you a good life..

990
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:39,775
..today you are calling her as thief!

991
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,702
Shame on you!
- Father, let it be!

992
01:30:44,817 --> 01:30:47,183
Dear, now what else is left?.

993
01:30:47,887 --> 01:30:52,722
Today he accused you.
In the future, he will accuse me.

994
01:30:52,825 --> 01:30:57,341
Father, I know
everything.Don"t force me to speak.

995
01:30:57,463 --> 01:30:59,385
Whatever you want to say,
sayit today itself, Kishore.

996
01:30:59,498 --> 01:31:02,149
You might not get a chance again.
- Father!

997
01:31:02,268 --> 01:31:04,224
Dear, he is not your
brother!He is not my son!

998
01:31:04,337 --> 01:31:08,762
He is our enemy! Now
I can"t stay in this house!

999
01:31:08,874 --> 01:31:10,922
Then leave! Who is stopping you?.

1000
01:31:11,043 --> 01:31:12,658
Tara! Come with me!

1001
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:17,897
Kamala, take me away from here right now!

1002
01:31:18,784 --> 01:31:19,978
Where shall I take you, father?.

1003
01:31:20,086 --> 01:31:21,314
Dear, there are countless wells!

1004
01:31:21,821 --> 01:31:23,140
Push me in any one of them!

1005
01:31:23,255 --> 01:31:25,871
But take me away from
here!Now I won"t stay here!

1006
01:31:25,991 --> 01:31:29,176
Father!
- Now I won"t stay here, dear!

1007
01:31:30,363 --> 01:31:31,921
Father, keep quiet!

1008
01:31:32,031 --> 01:31:34,226
Now I can"t keep quiet!Now
I can"t keep quiet!

1009
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:36,198
I will shout and tell to the world.

1010
01:31:36,302 --> 01:31:38,862
Parents, for whom
you are starving yourselves..

1011
01:31:38,971 --> 01:31:41,860
..for whom you are slogging..they
are not your sons..

1012
01:31:41,974 --> 01:31:44,863
..they are serpents..they are brutes!

1013
01:31:44,977 --> 01:31:50,415
Strangulate them! Let them starve!

1014
01:31:51,851 --> 01:31:56,038
Father, calm down!
- How do I calm down, dear?.

1015
01:31:56,956 --> 01:32:01,859
Kishore used to get wounded..and
I would get worried.

1016
01:32:02,962 --> 01:32:06,989
The thorn would pierce
him..and I would feel the pain.

1017
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:12,228
Dear, is this how
a father"slove is repaid?.

1018
01:32:15,307 --> 01:32:19,698
Father, please sit
down!Am I not your child?.

1019
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,817
No, dear. Take me away from here!
I feel choked here.

1020
01:32:25,918 --> 01:32:30,150
Yes! I will take you
away.I will take you away.

1021
01:32:50,342 --> 01:32:52,264
Quarrels are common.

1022
01:32:52,378 --> 01:32:55,267
But nobody leaves the house like this!

1023
01:32:56,182 --> 01:33:01,836
Tara.. I think Kamala had already
decided to leave.

1024
01:33:02,922 --> 01:33:04,844
That"s why the vessels
in the house were being sold.

1025
01:33:04,957 --> 01:33:06,276
Yes! That is fine.

1026
01:33:07,026 --> 01:33:11,019
You guys go away from
here!I want to stay alone.

1027
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:17,831
Tara, let"s go. These talks will increase
this poor guy"s troubles.

1028
01:33:17,937 --> 01:33:18,892
Come.

1029
01:33:40,059 --> 01:33:43,153
Greetings.
- Greetings, Ganga.

1030
01:33:55,074 --> 01:33:59,408
Who is it?. Kamala?.
- Yes, father.

1031
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:04,436
Did you find a job?.
- Father, I will get it.

1032
01:34:05,084 --> 01:34:07,370
You have to wander around so much.

1033
01:34:09,255 --> 01:34:12,019
If the brother
wasn"t useless,then this..

1034
01:34:12,124 --> 01:34:13,955
..wouldn"t have been the plight.

1035
01:34:16,429 --> 01:34:19,159
It was better if he
had died when he was born.

1036
01:34:19,265 --> 01:34:22,393
Father, don"t say this.
Itis not brother"s fault.

1037
01:34:23,002 --> 01:34:24,435
It is all about destiny.

1038
01:34:26,005 --> 01:34:27,393
If good days are not there..

1039
01:34:27,506 --> 01:34:28,985
..then bad days too won"t last for long.

1040
01:34:29,108 --> 01:34:30,973
You don"t worry.

1041
01:34:31,077 --> 01:34:33,125
Of course I am bound to worry, dear.

1042
01:34:33,245 --> 01:34:36,305
You should have
something to feed yourself.

1043
01:34:38,117 --> 01:34:40,369
Now I will try to find some work.

1044
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:42,908
What will you do?.

1045
01:34:43,022 --> 01:34:45,456
Father, you worry unnecessarily.

1046
01:34:45,558 --> 01:34:47,207
Come on. Rest.

1047
01:34:59,005 --> 01:35:02,020
""l got ruined and the
worldis upset with me.""

1048
01:35:02,141 --> 01:35:04,962
""l lost all my near ones.""

1049
01:35:05,077 --> 01:35:09,070
""We have become
beggars to feed ourselves.""

1050
01:35:09,182 --> 01:35:11,980
""We wander here and there.""

1051
01:35:12,084 --> 01:35:16,077
""We have become
beggars to feed ourselves.""

1052
01:35:16,188 --> 01:35:19,339
""We wander here and there.""

1053
01:35:30,169 --> 01:35:33,024
Kamala dear.
- Yes, father.

1054
01:35:33,138 --> 01:35:35,504
Whatever we have to
do to feed ourselves..

1055
01:35:35,608 --> 01:35:36,893
.. it is not bad.

1056
01:35:38,177 --> 01:35:42,295
Dear, I can"t see you
sad.I will beg from tomorrow.

1057
01:35:44,784 --> 01:35:48,299
I am there and you
thought of this.. it is not good.

1058
01:35:48,754 --> 01:35:50,767
You should have thought of
this after my death.

1059
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:56,157
Dear! Dear! I committed a mistake!

1060
01:35:56,896 --> 01:36:00,923
Dear, forgive me. Forgive me.

1061
01:36:08,808 --> 01:36:11,026
Sister, did you find any job?.

1062
01:36:12,912 --> 01:36:15,005
Today too I am going for the same thing.

1063
01:36:15,114 --> 01:36:19,050
If you want to look after
a child..then I will get you a job.

1064
01:36:19,819 --> 01:36:23,334
Yes! Yes! I will surely do
it! Take me there!

1065
01:36:23,756 --> 01:36:24,711
Come.

1066
01:36:29,928 --> 01:36:33,079
Sir is there. His natureis very good.

1067
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,350
He is going out for 1 5 days. Come.

1068
01:36:44,944 --> 01:36:46,297
Kamala!

1069
01:36:49,315 --> 01:36:51,875
Ganga, where have you brought me?.

1070
01:36:51,984 --> 01:36:56,102
I won"t work here. I won"twork here.
- Kamala!

1071
01:36:56,222 --> 01:36:59,020
I wouldn"t have
gone.But it is important.

1072
01:36:59,858 --> 01:37:01,052
It is government job.

1073
01:37:01,961 --> 01:37:05,294
Yes! Yes! Listen to
the government!And shoot me!

1074
01:37:06,966 --> 01:37:10,094
I am nothing for you!You
love somebody else!

1075
01:37:10,202 --> 01:37:11,157
What?.

1076
01:37:25,318 --> 01:37:27,183
Shyama, again the same thing.

1077
01:37:27,286 --> 01:37:30,380
So many times I have told you.

1078
01:37:31,890 --> 01:37:33,903
At least now don"t
talk about these things.

1079
01:37:34,026 --> 01:37:36,221
You know that this
will adversely affect your health.

1080
01:37:37,997 --> 01:37:40,010
Now I will leave.

1081
01:37:40,132 --> 01:37:42,862
Leave! I have not tied you up!

1082
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:49,963
Father, I will also come.

1083
01:37:50,076 --> 01:37:53,409
Yes! Everybody leave!
Ramu,you too leave!

1084
01:37:54,847 --> 01:37:56,235
Dear, you stay with your mother.

1085
01:37:56,348 --> 01:37:58,270
I will get loads of toys with you.

1086
01:37:59,018 --> 01:38:02,385
Ramu, give Munna that whistle.- Okay.

1087
01:38:02,488 --> 01:38:04,080
Son, go. Very good boy!

1088
01:38:08,895 --> 01:38:11,090
Ganga, you don"t
understand.I can"t work here.

1089
01:38:11,931 --> 01:38:13,853
And I can"t even tellyou the reason.

1090
01:38:13,966 --> 01:38:17,185
If not for yourself, then
at least think about your father.

1091
01:38:17,303 --> 01:38:19,282
It is not easy to get a job.

1092
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:32,847
Sir too went away.

1093
01:38:32,952 --> 01:38:34,840
It would have been so nice if you..

1094
01:38:34,954 --> 01:38:36,148
..had spoken about salary with him.

1095
01:38:36,255 --> 01:38:38,120
Now he will return after 1 5 days.

1096
01:38:40,292 --> 01:38:41,407
After 1 5 days.

1097
01:38:54,707 --> 01:38:56,390
""The moon is so far away.""

1098
01:38:56,509 --> 01:38:59,125
""lt prepares delicious sweets.""

1099
01:38:59,245 --> 01:39:01,679

""And you give it to
the child in a goblet.""

""And you give it to

1105
01:39:15,528 --> 01:39:18,144
""The moon is so far away.""

01:39:18,264 --> 01:39:20,755
""lt prepares delicious sweets.""

1107
01:39:32,545 --> 01:39:37,448
""The goblet broke.
And the child got upset.""

1108
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:42,749
""The goblet broke.
And the child got upset.""

1109
01:39:43,155 --> 01:39:48,479
""We will get new
goblets by clapping hands.""

1110
01:39:48,594 --> 01:39:54,123
""We will get new
goblets by clapping hands.""

1111
01:39:54,233 --> 01:39:56,701
""l will mollify the child.""

1112
01:39:56,802 --> 01:39:59,498
""We will have milk and cream.""

1113
01:39:59,605 --> 01:40:02,256
""The moon is so far away.""

01:40:02,375 --> 01:40:05,173
""lt prepares delicious sweets.""

1115
01:40:05,277 --> 01:40:07,643
""You eat in a plate.""

1116

""And you give it to

1117
01:40:10,516 --> 01:40:13,314

""lt prepares delicious sweets.""

1119
01:40:27,533 --> 01:40:32,584
""The child will go to
visit the moon in a flying saucer.""

1120
01:40:32,705 --> 01:40:38,154
""The child will go to
visit the moon in a flying saucer.""

1121
01:40:38,277 --> 01:40:43,510
""He will play blind man buff with
the stars and have fun.""

1122
01:40:43,615 --> 01:40:48,848
""After playing when
my child will feel content.""

1123
01:40:49,221 --> 01:40:54,488
""My child will return
home with a gay saunter.""

1124
01:40:54,594 --> 01:40:57,290

""You eat in a plate.""

1131
01:41:13,713 --> 01:41:16,364
""And you give it to
the child in a goblet.""

1132
01:41:16,482 --> 01:41:19,212
""The moon is so far away.""

1133
01:41:19,318 --> 01:41:21,684
""lt prepares delicious sweets.""

1134
01:41:49,582 --> 01:41:51,447
You are taking such good care of me.

1135
01:41:52,352 --> 01:41:53,910
Even my own sister
wouldn"t have done that.

1136
01:41:55,288 --> 01:41:57,244
You can call me as sister.

1137
01:41:57,356 --> 01:42:01,258
As you wish. I will call you sister.

1138
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,646
I too will call you sister.

1139
01:42:04,463 --> 01:42:09,583
Whenever I take your
name.. I remember that sinner Kamala.

1140
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:15,703
Why?. What has she done?.

1141
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:19,926
She ruined my family
life.She robbed my peace.

1142
01:42:21,381 --> 01:42:23,360
She snatched away my husband.

1143
01:42:24,717 --> 01:42:28,619
She snatched away
your husband.He doesn"t love you?.

1144
01:42:28,721 --> 01:42:33,385
What love?. I find his love as a charade!

1145
01:42:34,393 --> 01:42:37,487
His talks seem artificial and heartless.

1146
01:42:38,865 --> 01:42:41,447
As if he is always lost in her thoughts.

1147
01:42:43,335 --> 01:42:45,348
I am sure that he must be meeting her.

1148
01:42:46,405 --> 01:42:48,726
He always goes out
of town for 8-1 0 days.

1149
01:42:49,509 --> 01:42:56,244
You should have found
out the truth. Maybe you are wrong.

1150
01:42:57,684 --> 01:43:01,347
Maybe after marriage he
did not even see that girl"s face.

1151
01:43:01,454 --> 01:43:02,807
I don"t believe it!

1152
01:43:03,522 --> 01:43:05,922
I have heard that girl
has still not got married!

1153
01:43:08,527 --> 01:43:11,382
There could have been
some other reason of not marrying.

1154
01:43:11,497 --> 01:43:15,445
No! She only wants to destroy me!

1155
01:43:16,635 --> 01:43:18,648
She is waiting for my death!

1156
01:43:20,873 --> 01:43:22,966
My ailment worsens whenever
I think about that shameless woman!

1157
01:43:33,886 --> 01:43:37,947
Dear, give me 5
rupees.The opium has got over.

1158
01:43:38,424 --> 01:43:39,948
Uncle, I had given it
to you day before yesterday.

1159
01:43:40,459 --> 01:43:41,938
From where do I get it?.

1160
01:43:42,462 --> 01:43:44,589
Why don"t you give up having opium?.

1161
01:43:44,697 --> 01:43:46,585
I will do it gradually.

1162
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:48,291
Give me some money now.

1163
01:43:48,901 --> 01:43:50,880
Uncle, I am speaking
the truth.I don"t have money.

1164
01:44:25,504 --> 01:44:28,962
I want to sell these
buttons.- It belongs to you?.

1165
01:44:29,475 --> 01:44:33,468
Then what!
- Who is your father?.

1166
01:44:33,579 --> 01:44:35,410
Motaram, the opium vendor.

1167
01:44:35,515 --> 01:44:38,370
Sir! Listen to me!

1168
01:44:42,955 --> 01:44:45,446
She is the girl who had sold the vessels.

1169
01:44:45,558 --> 01:44:46,877
Today she has brought these buttons.

1170
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:51,709
These are mine.

1171
01:44:53,899 --> 01:44:54,888
Where did you get these?.

1172
01:44:55,501 --> 01:44:58,561
Where else?. I have bought it from
Kashiram, accountant.

1173
01:44:58,671 --> 01:45:00,389
You don"t get the opium for free.

1174
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:12,596
Tara! Tara!

1175
01:45:23,796 --> 01:45:25,024
Scoundrel!

1176
01:45:25,564 --> 01:45:28,931
You betray the people
who gave you shelter! Get lost!

1177
01:45:30,669 --> 01:45:33,433
Tara!
- What happened?.

1178
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:37,006
Your uncle is a thief!He is a scoundrel!

1179
01:45:37,109 --> 01:45:38,940
He had stolen the vessels
and he has stolen the buttons!

1180
01:45:39,678 --> 01:45:41,839
You too used to accuse my sister!

1181
01:45:51,057 --> 01:45:52,615
Because of you and this scoundrel..

1182
01:45:52,725 --> 01:45:55,705
..I banished my innocent sister and
father from the house.

1183
01:45:56,695 --> 01:45:58,708
Go away from here
otherwise I will kill both of you!

1184
01:45:58,831 --> 01:45:59,855
Get lost!

1185
01:46:13,045 --> 01:46:16,105
Forgive me. I didn"t know anything.

1186
01:46:16,616 --> 01:46:18,834
He had instigated me.

1187
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:21,598
He is not my uncle. He is my enemy!

1188
01:46:22,721 --> 01:46:26,817
Get lost! Thief!
Scoundrel!You robbed my house!

1189
01:46:26,926 --> 01:46:28,644
Get lost! Get lost!

1190
01:46:31,597 --> 01:46:32,985
Take your luggage!

1191
01:46:33,633 --> 01:46:35,157
You found only me to make enmity with!

1192
01:46:36,736 --> 01:46:39,022
Deceiver! Beware if you ever came here!

1193
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,858
At least give my opium box.

1194
01:46:47,646 --> 01:46:48,635
It is empty.

1195
01:46:56,989 --> 01:47:00,538
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

1196
01:47:03,596 --> 01:47:09,034
I can"t. Father might
forgive you.Sister might forgive you.

1197
01:47:11,604 --> 01:47:13,492
I was so unjust with them.

1198
01:47:45,805 --> 01:47:48,603
Kamala?.
- Greetings, accountant.

1199
01:47:48,707 --> 01:47:52,256
Greetings. You came here and cast
your spell on Mr. Prem.

1200
01:47:52,378 --> 01:47:56,075
You did the right
thing. Dear,recommend me too.

1201
01:47:56,182 --> 01:47:58,104
I too will lie here on the doorstep.

1202
01:47:58,217 --> 01:48:00,833
Your brother banished
me.I have no complaints.

1203
01:48:00,953 --> 01:48:03,274
Just make arrangements for my stay here.

1204
01:48:05,158 --> 01:48:07,979
Accountant, I am working here.

1205
01:48:08,727 --> 01:48:10,945
Mr. Prem has gone out for a few days.

1206
01:48:12,131 --> 01:48:13,689
I will leave this
place before his return.

1207
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:18,964
And listen. Don"t tell sister Shyama.

1208
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:21,787
That I am the same Kamala..

1209
01:48:21,907 --> 01:48:23,704
..whose name too
she doesn"t want to hear.

1210
01:48:23,809 --> 01:48:28,599
Dear, if you forbid
me,then I won"t say it.

1211
01:48:29,782 --> 01:48:31,170
Is she that same Kamala?.

1212
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:36,710
Yes! That same serpent! Under the
pretext of job..

1213
01:48:36,823 --> 01:48:39,223
Sarla, it is the time
for Munna to have his milk.

1214
01:48:44,196 --> 01:48:48,257
Under the pretext of job.. Kamala has
come to ruin your life.

1215
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:56,322
She wants to give you a brutal death.

1216
01:48:57,042 --> 01:48:58,088
Accountant!

1217
01:48:58,911 --> 01:49:02,642
Yes! Daughter-in-law,l
will be back soon.

1218
01:49:06,219 --> 01:49:13,625
"She wants to give you a brutal death."

1219
01:49:40,919 --> 01:49:42,807
"Let that witch come now."

1220
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:13,229
Father, I am leaving. And
I will take my salary till date.

1221
01:50:13,953 --> 01:50:15,068
Why, dear?.

1222
01:50:17,523 --> 01:50:21,857
Just like that, father.
Now I don"t like working there.

1223
01:50:25,865 --> 01:50:29,722
They live in that
flat.- Thanks. Tara, come.

1224
01:50:34,974 --> 01:50:36,930
Father, I am leaving.

1225
01:50:37,977 --> 01:50:39,023
Father!

1226
01:50:40,146 --> 01:50:41,135
Father!

1227
01:50:42,315 --> 01:50:43,430
Sister!

1228
01:50:43,549 --> 01:50:45,835
Kishore, leave my feet!

1229
01:50:45,951 --> 01:50:49,853
Forgive me, father!
Forgiveme! I made a mistake!

1230
01:50:49,956 --> 01:50:51,275
I have made a mistake!

1231
01:50:51,390 --> 01:50:52,436
It would have been good if I had..

1232
01:50:52,558 --> 01:50:53,946
..strangulated you when you were born!

1233
01:50:54,059 --> 01:50:56,914
Get lost! Leave me! Get lost!

1234
01:50:57,330 --> 01:50:59,821
Father!
- Dear, you don"t say anything.

1235
01:50:59,932 --> 01:51:03,424
It was my uncle"s
fault.Father, forgive us!

1236
01:51:03,836 --> 01:51:05,394
Daughter-in-law,
don"t touch my feet!

1237
01:51:05,504 --> 01:51:09,088
Till the time you don"t forgiveme,
I won"t leave your feet!

1238
01:51:10,376 --> 01:51:16,178
Father, forgive her. It isnot their fault.
- Never!

1239
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:19,730
Father, forget what happened.

1240
01:51:19,952 --> 01:51:24,184
What had to happen,
it has happened. Forgive them.

1241
01:51:29,395 --> 01:51:35,812
Daughter-in-law, get
up.Get up. Kishore! My son!

1242
01:51:35,935 --> 01:51:37,459
Father!
- Kishore!

1243
01:51:37,570 --> 01:51:38,764
Father!
- Kishore!

1244
01:51:43,876 --> 01:51:46,094
Sister, make preparations to leave.

1245
01:51:46,212 --> 01:51:49,340
We will leave right
away.- Okay, Kishore.

1246
01:51:50,049 --> 01:51:51,971
Father, I will go
and tell Shyama sister..

1247
01:51:52,084 --> 01:51:54,063
..that I won"t be working at her place.

1248
01:51:54,186 --> 01:51:55,346
Let it be, sister.

1249
01:51:55,454 --> 01:51:59,845
No, Kishore. I should at least inform
her. I will be back soon.

1250
01:52:20,046 --> 01:52:21,365
Shyama sister.

1251
01:52:25,551 --> 01:52:28,315
Kamala! Come. Have a seat.

1252
01:52:31,591 --> 01:52:34,116
Shyama sister.. forgive me.

1253
01:52:34,994 --> 01:52:36,256
I am not going to
work from today onwards.

1254
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:38,545
I am returning to my home.

1255
01:52:39,098 --> 01:52:41,532
Why?. Even this is your house.

1256
01:52:42,101 --> 01:52:46,936
This is your big heartedness.But
I will have to leave.

1257
01:52:48,007 --> 01:52:52,489
Forgive me if I have
made any mistake. Bye.

1258
01:52:52,612 --> 01:52:57,060
Wait! Today l
have made offerings. Eat this.

1259
01:53:10,363 --> 01:53:14,481
Daughter-in-law, l
got the whiff of food.

1260
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,033
You have made sweets.

1261
01:53:17,036 --> 01:53:20,221
Yes. Today is the festival.
So I have made the offerings for that.

1262
01:53:20,973 --> 01:53:21,997
Have this.

1263
01:53:22,108 --> 01:53:25,032
God bless you, dear. I
will have to eat the offering.

1264
01:53:25,144 --> 01:53:26,532
This festival doesn"t come everyday.

1265
01:53:26,646 --> 01:53:27,601
Accountant!

1266
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,028
Aren"t you ashamed to
eat the offerings given to others?.

1267
01:53:30,149 --> 01:53:31,195
Give it to Kamala.

1268
01:53:31,317 --> 01:53:32,966
You
don"t understand,daughter-in-law.

1269
01:53:33,085 --> 01:53:35,451
If you refused offerings,then you
will go to hell.

1270
01:53:35,554 --> 01:53:37,954
Keep it here! I say keep it here!

1271
01:53:38,057 --> 01:53:40,036
And go and take your share!

1272
01:53:43,996 --> 01:53:48,512
Sister, eat it.
- Unnecessarily you scolded him.

1273
01:53:48,634 --> 01:53:52,035
I did the right thing.
I don"t like bad habits.

1274
01:53:53,172 --> 01:53:55,572
You eat it. Come on.

1275
01:54:21,767 --> 01:54:23,985
Why?. What happened?.

1276
01:54:24,103 --> 01:54:32,101
Nothing. I felt dizzy.
I will leave now. Greetings.

1277
01:54:33,112 --> 01:54:34,192
Greetings.

1278
01:55:09,582 --> 01:55:15,145
Kamala! You and here!
- Yes, Mr. Prem.

1279
01:55:19,325 --> 01:55:20,553
Where are you going?.

1280
01:55:21,494 --> 01:55:26,124
Maybe you don"t know how
happy I feel to see you here.

1281
01:55:27,299 --> 01:55:31,326
And maybe you don"t
know how much sad I am feeling.

1282
01:55:31,437 --> 01:55:34,292
I used to consider you as God.

1283
01:55:34,407 --> 01:55:40,209
But you are not God.
You are a selfish person.

1284
01:55:40,313 --> 01:55:45,148
Shyama left everything for your love.

1285
01:55:45,251 --> 01:55:49,153
And you didn"t giver her that love.

1286
01:55:50,189 --> 01:55:56,207
Mr. Prem, you have
only given her unhappiness.

1287
01:55:57,997 --> 01:56:02,991
She is still waiting for your love.

1288
01:56:03,102 --> 01:56:05,423
She is not waiting for
my love.She is only jealous.

1289
01:56:06,005 --> 01:56:08,018
I was detached from you.

1290
01:56:08,141 --> 01:56:11,269
I wanted to live happily with Shyama.
I wanted to forget you.

1291
01:56:11,377 --> 01:56:13,572
But she always doubted our love.

1292
01:56:17,249 --> 01:56:19,740
She is not well. Believe me, Kamala.

1293
01:56:19,852 --> 01:56:21,900
I will even give up my life to cure her.

1294
01:56:24,089 --> 01:56:27,786
I too pray to God
that you both live happily.

1295
01:56:29,962 --> 01:56:32,396
I will leave now.

1296
01:56:37,770 --> 01:56:38,794
Kamala!

1297
01:56:38,905 --> 01:56:39,860
Kamala!

1298
01:56:48,948 --> 01:56:49,937
Shyama!

1299
01:56:51,317 --> 01:56:54,741
Shyama! Shyama! Ramu.
- Yes.

1300
01:56:54,853 --> 01:56:56,013
Go and get my bag.

1301
01:56:58,858 --> 01:57:03,409
Now I won"t live.
Save Kamala sister. I gave her opium.

1302
01:57:03,963 --> 01:57:06,761
Opium?.
- Opium?.

1303
01:57:07,967 --> 01:57:11,755
Opium! Daughter-in-law, from where
did you get the opium?.

1304
01:57:11,871 --> 01:57:12,895
From your box.

1305
01:57:13,005 --> 01:57:16,020
From my box! There
was no opium in my box.

1306
01:57:19,211 --> 01:57:21,429
For the past three days, I have been
surviving on another drug.

1307
01:57:21,881 --> 01:57:23,143
Nothing will happen to her.

1308
01:57:23,249 --> 01:57:25,114
Daughter-in-law,
you don"t worry.

1309
01:57:27,553 --> 01:57:31,819
Good. I am saved
from committing a grave sin.

1310
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:40,981
Kamala sister.. now l
handover him and Munna to you.

1311
01:57:43,169 --> 01:57:44,215
Forgive me, sister.

1312
01:57:50,009 --> 01:57:51,089
Shyama!
