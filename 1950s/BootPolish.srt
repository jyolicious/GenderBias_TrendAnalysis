1
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,276
How far is it?
- We're almost there

2
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,611
l'm a greater hurry than you are.
This is social-service, for you

3
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,455
Cholera has spread in the city.
l must see you off...

4
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,022
and take the first train to Jalgaon

5
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,465
Where is Kamla Devi's house?
- Over there

6
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,700
Kamla Devi!

7
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,310
Kamla Devi...

8
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,719
Sit down, children

9
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,489
She must've gone out to fetch water.
She'll be back soon

10
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,136
l can't wait, children.
l must leave now

11
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,508
Here you are...
give it to the lady

12
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,141
l've written everything in it.
And don't start crying

13
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,746
Oh yes... do eat something

14
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,754
Who are you children?

15
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,728
''The children's father
was deported last week''

16
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,167
''Their mother died of cholera.
So l leave them with you''

17
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,412
Your aunt will be back soon

18
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,417
Will you have something to eat?

19
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:24,221
Well? Whose children are you feeding?

20
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,825
They're now your children, Kamla.
- My children?

21
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,996
Look what a sweet child he is

22
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,702
He'll be of great help to you
when he grows up

23
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,636
Treat them like your own, okay?
- Why not?

24
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:51,776
They're my brother-in-law's kids.
- Well said, Kamla

25
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,715
How come?
- The children are here. That's why

26
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,448
Oh no. l'm happy because his
father has been deported!

27
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,186
l'm happy because his mother
has died of cholera!

28
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,190
What l regret is that she didn't
take them away with herself

29
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,031
Kamla, what are you saying?
- Right too

30
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:13,461
When my husband died, their father
threw me out to suffer in penury

31
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,464
And they come to my doorstep today?
This is good indeed

32
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,035
No, Kamla. Don't say that

33
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,175
You must've seen
a nice soul's face today

34
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,485
lt was your face l saw this morning.
- But l'm not a bad man

35
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,221
Oh yes, you're an angel!
A bloody bootlegger!

36
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,859
And you're the goddess
who sells her modesty?

37
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:37,492
Kamla, don't make me lose my temper.
- Go away!

38
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:42,096
God has been kind to you, Kamla.
He has given you two little children

39
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,901
Be a good woman and make
good human beings out of them

40
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,502
Not like the folks you and l are.
- They'll see what l make out of them!

41
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,512
Won't you go away?
- l'm going

42
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,517
Listen, Kamla.
Don't you hit them

43
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,845
Get lost, l say!
Don't hit them, he says!

44
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,188
Come on!

45
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,873
Stand here and beg

46
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,238
lf you don't make four annas
by this evening, you've had it

47
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:32,450
Stretch your palms...
Give me a penny, sir

48
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:38,923
Give me a penny, sir...
give me a penny

49
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,304
''You'll be robbed,
if you don't give me a penny''

50
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,370
''You'll go to the police station
if a theft takes place...''

51
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,306
''and file a report''

52
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:05,311
''Why must you do all that?
Just give us a penny''

53
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,755
''Don't give us a penny,
and your grandma will die''

54
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,658
''lf your grandma dies,
you'll do the rites...''

55
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,731
''and feed the Brahmins''

56
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,998
''Why must you do all that?
Just give us a penny''

57
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,308
Brothers and sisters!
We have no support

58
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,180
My brother was born blind.
My father died in the hospital

59
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,414
And my mother, in the war in Burma.
- No

60
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,626
Father died in battle,
mother died in hospital...

61
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,625
Oh yes. Mother died in the hospital
and father died fighting in Burma

62
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,093
My brother is blind.
l was going to blinded too

63
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,426
We have no one. You'll lose
nothing, if you help us

64
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,638
May God bless your children.
- Please give us a penny

65
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,644
Sir... please give me a penny

66
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:10,346
God will bless you, sir

67
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,209
Give me a penny, sir.
God will bless you, sir

68
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,326
Belu! Come here!

69
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,893
What?

70
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,470
Belu, there's Raj Kapoor

71
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,407
ls that Raj Kapoor?
They're all Raj Kapoors nowadays

72
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,341
l've seen many of their kind

73
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,678
So you can see?

74
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,279
Hello, Chitku.
- Hello indeed

75
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:54,692
Begging, already?
For pennies?

76
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,129
Shoeshine man.
- Yes, sir

77
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:28,852
Give me a penny, sir.
God will bless you

78
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,461
l've had nothing to eat, sir.
l'm hungry, sir

79
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,058
Get lost!

80
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,467
Why push a poor boy ?
Give me a penny, and l'll pray for you

81
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,708
2 annas, sir. For my hard work.
And see the first-class polish

82
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,361
''Do not spit''

83
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,368
How much do you have?
- And you?

84
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,110
Berries, 2 for one paisa

85
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,316
Brother, may l buy berries?
- Berries!

86
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,523
l collect money for the polish
and you want to buy berries!

87
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,122
Fresh berries, 2 for one paise

88
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,227
Want to eat berries?

89
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,141
C'mon. Don't cry!

90
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,980
Hey berry-seller!
- Do you have the money?

91
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,379
First let's have a deal.
- You get 2 for a paisa

92
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,646
Let's have 3 for a paise.
- 2, l said. Or go going

93
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,415
Wait... Belu, he won't give us
3 for a paisa

94
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,459
Ask him for four, in that case.
- Don't waste my time

95
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,164
Wait here

96
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,135
Eat one, Bhola.
- You eat. l'm not a kid anymore

97
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,572
Don't put on airs. Eat one.
- You eat it

98
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,645
You'll have to eat one

99
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,447
Ticket-checker! Run!

100
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,265
You still haven't eaten it?
Silly girl! lt won't double

101
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,573
We have seven annas
and two paisas today

102
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:06,146
Let's hide an anna under the tree
and give the rest to aunt

103
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,682
l don't like to beg, Belu

104
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:13,849
''Give me a penny, sir...
Give me a penny, my Lord''

105
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,685
And everybody curses us

106
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:20,895
When we have a rupee and 8 annas...
- What then?

107
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,164
l'll buy two tins of polish,
black and brown, and a brush too

108
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:31,308
l'll make a rupee every day.
See how much Chitku makes?

109
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,905
What if aunt gets to know?
- She'll give us a thrashing

110
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,248
That she does every day.
But how will she get to know?

111
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,148
Know what? Let's keep the stuff
with John Chacha (uncle)

112
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:57,926
Check how much we have, Belu
- One paise, two paise, four annas...

113
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,933
We've got to give aunt 4 annas, Belu.
- Oh yes, l know

114
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,945
Four annas, five annas...
- Here's 2 annas more

115
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,942
You've messed up my count!
You count it, l can't

116
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:15,747
Bhola! Here comes Chitku!
Hide the money

117
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,417
Beggars everywhere

118
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,355
Hello, Chitku.
- Hello

119
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,431
Back from begging...?
''Give me a penny, my lord...?''

120
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,202
Can't you find other work?
- ln a few days, Chitku...

121
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,240
we're going to stop begging.
We're going to buy polish and a brush

122
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,705
You will see then.
- See what?

123
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:43,212
Young pissers!
You talk about polishing shoes

124
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:47,676
lt's a big ask, my boy.
lt took me a year to master it

125
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,683
Big deal! Bhola will learn it too.
- Bhola will? As if it were a joke

126
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,793
lt has been our family business...
And he'll learn it in a day?

127
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,527
Where will you get the money
to buy the polish and the brush?

128
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,598
We've collected the money.
- No, we haven't...

129
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,599
Shut up!

130
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,998
What were you doing by the tree?
- Nothing. We were only playing

131
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,705
Playing eh?

132
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:19,015
Say hello to Kamla on my behalf.
Kamla...! What a beauty

133
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,820
Bhola, l told you not
to talk to him

134
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,823
John Chacha said he's not a nice boy.
- We won't talk to him again

135
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,825
Let's go John Chacha. Come on

136
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,775
Has it sprung something?
- l sure can see a strand or two

137
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,778
Didn't l tell you?
That's the real oil

138
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,180
Get started again

139
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,796
John Chacha!

140
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,125
Run out of polish, John Chacha?
- Polish?

141
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:16,031
What a shine he has given you!
- Not polish... it's a massage

142
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,605
But your hair, John Chacha...
- l've sprung some, son

143
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,746
Look, Belu. He had two strands
yesterday. They've disappeared today

144
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,885
You use the polish on your head.
And your face sprouts the hair?

145
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,887
Shut up!
- Use bittergourd, uncle

146
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,528
You'll have long hair.
- Get out!

147
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:48,498
You're bothering me! Go home!
Your aunt will straighten you out!

148
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,916
Watch it... aunt might see us

149
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,982
l'll go in first, Bhola.
- No, l'll go in first

150
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,917
Wait... l'm going in first.
Hold the puppy

151
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,278
So you're here, little witch?
Where's the rascal?

152
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,311
Didn't l tell you to return with
the provisions before noon?

153
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,781
Where are the rations?

154
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,944
Your mother is dead but she
left me with this nuisance!

155
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,952
l accepted you for
the sake of the world,...

156
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,026
or l'd have thrown you in
the gutters. Where are the rations?

157
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,167
The ration card...?

158
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,837
Your father has been deported.
And the two of you have fun here?

159
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,176
Why don't you just die instead?
What do you mean to me anyway?

160
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,345
The ration card!
- What?

161
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,679
What did you say?
- Nothing.

162
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,186
l've just been mumbling
something, aunt

163
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:17,428
What have you been whispering?
- l'll play a cripple...

164
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,997
and beg henceforth, aunt.
- So?

165
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:27,205
l said, l'm a cripple,
l'm hungry, l'm blind...

166
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,809
my parents are dead, give me
a penny, my hand is broken...

167
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,205
Did they give you the money?
- No, aunt

168
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,377
You threw away the money?
- No...

169
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:41,349
that fat man sneezed
and threw all the stuff out

170
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:46,024
Threw it out? What rubbish!
- No, aunt. He threw me out

171
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,393
No wonder! Worthless children!
You can't even beg properly

172
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,963
Come, l'll teach you

173
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,893
l asked you to play blind
and beat your stomach

174
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:01,103
''Mister! May you be happy.
Two paisas... give me two paisas''

175
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:07,137
''Mister, give me two paisa.
l'll buy myself some bread''

176
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,507
''l've been blind all day...
- Blind all day? What rubbish!

177
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:14,741
No, aunt... l've been blind
for ages... since l was born!

178
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,217
Remember the song l taught you?
Spread your frock

179
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:23,061
''l spread my frock for alms...
blessings for you, l have''

180
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:30,064
''l spread my frock for alms...
blessings for you, l have''

181
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,833
Remember now? Do that from tomorrow

182
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,273
And wash the utensils

183
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,873
Where do you think you're going?
And what are we waiting for?

184
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,140
Go and stand in the queue.
- Let me take it first

185
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,878
l must go home, or aunt will beat me.
- Get back there

186
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,280
Get back, boy... back!

187
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,031
How much time for
the rations to be given?

188
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,305
Talk softly. Why're you yelling?
- You talk loudly too

189
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,580
You look like a pick-pocket to me

190
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,312
He asks how many pockets are picked!

191
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,653
Hurry up. Can't you see?
lt's beginning to rain

192
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:58,482
Come, boy. You're my first customer.
Let me see your palm

193
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,522
How much money are you carrying?
- l've got just 2 paise...

194
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,491
So l'll tell you the future
for 2 paisas worth. Out with it

195
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,698
But sir...
- Out with it son

196
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,162
l've been waiting all day
and nobody turned up

197
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,363
Out with it.
- All right. l'll give it to you

198
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,707
Boy, you aren't going
to study anymore

199
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,037
l haven't studied anything
in the past either

200
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,714
Your two paisas worth is over.
- How about my work...?

201
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,610
Get lost! You want to
know everything at 2 paisa?

202
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,680
Please, sir... Tell me
something about my work

203
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,349
You'll wear out shoes all your life!
- ls that true?

204
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,494
l'm going to polish shoes?

205
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:43,065
l've had my money's worth!
My business is taking off

206
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,405
Belu, l'm going to be a big man!
That's what the soothsayer says!

207
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,073
See what...

208
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,748
Belu, you got a lot of
beating today, didn't you?

209
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,422
You take a beating for my sake.
But l'll take it henceforth

210
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,927
Belu, see what l've got for you.
Eat it up

211
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,103
You're back, you worthless boy!
Bloody rascal!

212
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,433
You're sitting here!
- Let go, aunt

213
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,244
l've been starving and
you went disappearing!

214
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,376
Rascal! Scoundrel!
Where is the money?

215
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:36,043
Don't hit him, aunt!
- Get lost, girl

216
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:42,188
You just want to run away from work!
So starve to death

217
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,161
You're Satan.
- You're Satan

218
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,635
You sell hooch! Thug!

219
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,205
Don't you have a heart? You beat
the children so mercilessly?

220
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,705
Why don't you take the children
away with you, if you have a heart?

221
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:08,280
l'd be rid of them!
- l don't have enough to feed them

222
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,889
And the sort of work l do,
l could go to jail any day

223
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:21,159
l wish, every innocent child
like them...

224
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,093
l've heard that crap from
paupers already

225
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:28,497
lf you don't manage to bring
10 annas by tomorrow, just you see

226
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,509
Every child like them...

227
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,983
Bhola, you took a
lot of beating today?

228
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,521
Yes, Chacha.
- Never mind

229
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:49,254
Belu, get up child. Come to me.
Are you hungry?

230
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,925
Yes, Chacha. l feel hungry
every day

231
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,033
That's the worst disease
our nation suffers from

232
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,536
Come on... get up

233
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:14,245
Bravo! You must face every
hardship in life with a smile

234
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,680
Here. Eat

235
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,219
Won't you eat some, Chacha?
- l've already eaten, my dear

236
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,357
You eat. Go on

237
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,266
Bhola, just give up begging

238
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,367
God has given you two strong hands

239
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,597
Since you're a small boy,
do something small for now

240
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,078
These very hands will accomplish
something big in the future

241
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,741
There's nothing in the world
that your hands cannot do

242
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,586
Bhola, starve to death,
if you have to...

243
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:53,582
but never ever beg again.
Don't ever beg, my son

244
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,759
And aunt says we must
beg every day

245
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:00,031
John Chacha says we must
never ever beg

246
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:05,598
What are we to do, Bhola?
- Chacha is right, Belu

247
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:11,331
Chacha, l take an oath.
l won't beg from tomorrow

248
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:16,205
Well said, my son.
This is just what l expected from you

249
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,415
l've grown old, you see

250
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:25,951
l'd surely have helped you.
But you know my ways

251
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:30,685
You don't know, Bhola.
l've spent a lifetime...

252
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:35,222
in begging, crime and
other terrible things

253
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:40,297
l'm a bad man.
But you must be a good man, son

254
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,969
You must become a big man

255
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,172
After l'm dead,
my soul will live in you

256
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,641
ln you lies my new life.
My new life

257
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,646
My new life

258
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,321
Have you eaten, children?
- Oh yes, Chacha. Lots too

259
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,394
Chacha, it's such a dark night.
- Yes, Chacha. lt's a black night

260
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,325
Yes children. lt sure is
a dark night

261
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,327
See those slums, Bhola?
- Yes, l do

262
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:19,676
ln them live thousands of poor people,
leading lives like animals...

263
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,340
spending another black night of
their lives on dark nights

264
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,346
But this dark night will end
some day. lt surely will, some day

265
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,146
l have a strong feeling

266
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,691
And it'll be a new dawn

267
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:37,691
And the rising sun will
spread gold in their lives

268
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,757
You will grow up. Be well read,
dance and be a happy man

269
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,294
God provides for everyone...
He provides for everyone, my children

270
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,750
''After night...''

271
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,758
''comes day''

272
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:52,766
''This is how a lifetime is spent''

273
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,792
''After night...''

274
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,125
''After night...''

275
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,810
''This long difficult journey
through life...''

276
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:40,346
''makes one man laugh,
and another man cry''

277
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,622
''With every step he takes...''

278
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,156
''man moves so far ahead''

279
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:01,231
''With every straw...''

280
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,842
''is the nest built''

281
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,447
''After night...''

282
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:33,666
''There is darkness,
there is light...''

283
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,101
''every flower that blossoms,
has to wither away''

284
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,676
''From a playful childhood
you step into youth...''

285
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:49,886
''and old age makes you suffer''

286
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,597
''The wheel of fortune moves on...''

287
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,636
''and that is what
we call destiny''

288
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,711
''After night,
comes the day''

289
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:25,287
''This is how a lifetime is spent''

290
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,923
''After night...''

291
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,706
''John Chacha...
you're such a nice man''

292
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,279
''Every child loves you''

293
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:11,268
''Tell us what to do,
so we don't get a bad name''

294
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,324
''What is destiny, Chacha?''

295
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:49,598
''Why is one man a beggar and
why is another man rich?''

296
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,012
''Why don't we have any work?''

297
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,818
''To beg for a living
is no good''

298
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:32,641
''March ahead...''

299
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,386
''you're one in a million.
March ahead, my boy''

300
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,853
''March ahead''

301
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,327
''Never look back,
never be afraid...''

302
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,664
''the earth and the skies
belong to you... just march ahead''

303
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,540
''Reach for the stars''

304
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,681
''You're one in a million, my boy.
Just march on''

305
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,562
''After night...''

306
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,098
''will come a new day''

307
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:43,109
''After the dark night...''

308
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,786
''will come a new dawn''

309
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,019
Chitku! My money!

310
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,757
John Chacha...
Chitku! My money!

311
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,957
Give me back my money, Chitku!
- Let go!

312
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,993
John Chacha! My money!

313
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,758
What money?

314
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,162
John Chacha!
Chitku's taking away my money!

315
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,977
l'm going to thrash you!
Let go!

316
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,977
Return my money, Chitku...
Else, l'll tell John Chacha

317
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,918
Give me back my money

318
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,181
Let go! Let go, l say!

319
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,192
Chitku! Give me back my money!

320
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,861
Belu, Chitku has taken our money!
How will l buy the polish?

321
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,200
Belu! Our money!

322
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,201
l came to take look at our money
this morning, and saw Chitku around

323
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,873
l quickly took out the money.
l did the right thing, didn't l?

324
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,704
Yes, Belu. You're a very sweet girl.
Come, let's go and buy the polish

325
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,213
But we're still 2 annas short

326
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,214
May l say something, Bhola?
Let's beg for the last time today

327
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,719
No...
- One last time?

328
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,229
Okay, Belu. Let's go

329
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,396
Give us a penny, sir...
We're starving

330
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,742
Go away

331
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:48,977
Get lost

332
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,948
Go away... you're begging?

333
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,248
What's the boy saying?
- He seems to be dumb

334
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,122
Give the poor boy an anna.
- An anna?

335
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,058
Yes, an anna. Give it to him

336
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,083
Bhola! Come here!

337
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,287
What is it, Belu?
- We have only a rupee and 4 annas

338
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:36,082
But we had one rupee and 8 annas.
Let me see

339
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,288
Two and two is four...
- You can't count. Give that to me

340
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,862
Eight annas and four annas
make twelve annas

341
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:48,096
And another five make it 15 annas.
- 12 and 5 is not 15!

342
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,637
Can you even count properly?
- As if you can!

343
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,971
Two and two and two makes it six.
We're still two annas short

344
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,448
What are we going to do?
- l have an idea, Bhola

345
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,876
First class!
- What idea?

346
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,315
How about going to John Chacha
and getting 2 annas out of him?

347
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,951
That miser will give you 2 annas?
- Let's go, come on

348
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:26,332
Who is it?
- What are you up to, Chacha?

349
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:30,204
You won't understand.
- Go ahead and tell us, Chacha

350
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,349
l said you won't understand.
- Still, Chacha...

351
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,345
Oh yes. Still

352
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:42,019
l'm making a unique oil
- Unique?

353
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,094
Yes, it has fennel-water,
powdered clove...

354
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,364
special grass and other things.
l've got to remember that

355
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,897
Special grass. No other grass will do.
Also goose berry crush...

356
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:57,607
l'll mix all that and boil it in fat.
And the moment l massage my head...

357
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,170
Your hair will disappear!
- Disappear?

358
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:05,037
Absolutely. Your hair will vanish.
- How come?

359
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,850
You've forgotten a very
important ingredient

360
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,187
What?
- The same old thing

361
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:14,983
What old thing?
- The seed of the berry

362
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,223
The seed of the berry?
- Yes, uncle

363
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:21,125
That's what old Kamla uses.
And what long hair she has!

364
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,997
Chacha, for just a rupee's seeds,
you get such long hair

365
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,904
So long for 8 annas
and so much for 4 annas worth

366
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:30,935
And just this much for 2 annas.
How long do you want your hair?

367
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,105
Will my hair grow with berry seed?
- Of course. We'll go and get it

368
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,711
Give us the money

369
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,209
Money? Oh no!

370
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:46,215
Berry seed will make my hair grow?
- Yes, Chacha

371
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,492
All right. Wait here

372
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,827
Here you are...
- ls that all? Just one paisa?

373
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,102
No, l can't do it

374
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:07,706
l can't go all the way,
buy the berries, wash them...

375
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,672
it's going to kill me!

376
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:14,578
Will 3 annas do, Belu?
- Yes, we'll manage

377
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,788
For Chacha's sake...
So give us 3 annas, Chacha

378
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,590
3 annas?
- Yes, Chacha. Out with it.

379
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:26,057
All right, since you insist.
But l'll grow hair, won't l?

380
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,458
Oh sure, long hair

381
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,800
Not berry-seed, Chacha...
- Use bittergourd instead!

382
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,638
Damn it!

383
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:40,476
l understand everything

384
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:46,483
lf berry-seed could grow hair,
there wouldn't be bald men like me

385
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,656
Bhola, why didn't you buy
the polish from that shop?

386
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,228
lt must've dried up
lying on those shelves, Belu

387
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,626
We'd have wasted our money.
- All right

388
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,836
Let's make sure we buy nice polish.
- Yes, come on

389
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,571
This is worth 10 rupees 12 annas
and this is 1 4 rupees and 5 annas

390
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,519
What are you kids up to...?
What do you want?

391
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,414
We need a first class brush
- And polish

392
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,216
Brown.
- And black

393
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,224
But what brush do you want?
- What brush?

394
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,520
A nice shoe-brush.
- l'll get it. Wait here

395
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,693
When we have empty polish tins...

396
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:40,530
we'll keep them safely.
We won't bury them under the tree

397
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:49,178
Here's your brush. For 1 rupee,
12 annas, 8 annas and 4 annas

398
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,575
Which one do you want?
l'll get some polish too

399
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,544
This is a nice one, Bhola.
- But that's worth a rupee

400
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,119
No, this is worth 8 annas.
- Here's the polish

401
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,148
6 annas, 8 annas, 10 annas
and 4 annas

402
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,051
Take your pick

403
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,991
He said 3 annas for this.
- And l thought it was worth 4 annas

404
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,564
Have you chosen something?
- One moment, please

405
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:16,167
You said 7 annas for this, right?
- No, 10 annas for this and 12 for this

406
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,566
No, he said 3 annas for this.
- What a racket you are creating

407
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:25,037
Your total is 12 annas and 4 annas...
- 1 4 annas in all

408
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,243
No. 1 rupee and 5 annas.
- Hurry up

409
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,386
You owe me 1 rupee and 2 annas.
- Can't you reduce it a bit?

410
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,454
Can't you reduce it a bit?
- Not a penny. Out with the money

411
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,588
Here you are

412
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:40,790
1 rupee and 2 annas, 12 annas,
8 annas and 4 annas...

413
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,932
the kids have conned me!

414
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:55,612
Belu, our Hindustan is free today!
We're giving up begging

415
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,207
Long live Mahatma Gandhi.
- Long live Nehru!

416
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,485
Just see how much of money
l make, Belu

417
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,347
You will buy me berries, won't you?
- l'll even buy you a frock

418
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,221
A red frock?
- Yes, very red

419
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,425
Let's go and tell John Chacha.
- Let's go

420
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,300
What is it, children?

421
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,545
John Chacha, we've brought
something new today

422
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,440
What is it? Show me.
- lt's good news

423
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,513
What?
- Close your eyes. Go on

424
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,312
Here l go.
- Let's go in. Come on

425
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,664
Don't watch, Chacha.
- Who's watching

426
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,005
Now open your eyes, Chacha

427
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,959
Well done, children.
- We won't beg from tomorrow

428
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,563
That's very nice.
This is the way to life, my children

429
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,703
Achieve something,
with these hands of yours

430
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:33,098
No one's getting anything like this.
Stand in a queue... in one single line

431
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,037
Everyone will get something. The lady
will herself give away alms today

432
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,039
Not only will you get money,
you'll get some grams too

433
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,720
What's happening out there today?
- Nothing, Chacha

434
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,059
Some for me, lady...

435
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,729
My children are starving

436
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,998
l've been starving for 2 days.
God will bless you, lady

437
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:03,737
Relax... everybody will
get something

438
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:09,973
Patience

439
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,757
You're giving away alms, lady?

440
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,093
You think God will
give you a bountiful...

441
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,225
for the 2 annas you're
handing out today?

442
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,556
What rubbish are you talking?
- She has built four temples

443
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:31,560
And two sanctuaries for cows.
- She is blessed with a grandson

444
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:35,169
So she's giving away alms today
- And what rubbish are you talking?

445
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,436
What l'm saying is right, sir

446
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,676
Had it not been for people like you,
these beggars would either have died...

447
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:46,440
or worked for a living.
Don't give them alms, give them work

448
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,785
ls that my look-out?
- lt isn't my look-out, neither yours

449
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,655
ls it the look-out of outsiders then?
Whose look-out is it?

450
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,584
Shut up! You dare talk back?
- You interfere in a noble cause?

451
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,191
Get lost!

452
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,892
Old fossil, what nonsense is that?
You don't beg, and you won't let us beg?

453
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,792
That lady came every fortnight,
but now you've offended her too

454
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,328
We won't even get the 2 annas
we used to get in alms!

455
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:08,969
This is our source of livelihood

456
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,403
You're snatching the bread
from our children?

457
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,802
No, don't say such things. The children
are stepping into a new world

458
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,373
Don't teach them ways
of begging, please

459
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,812
Where's the new world? We starved
yesterday and we're starving today

460
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,816
Where is the new world?

461
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,085
Let's go before the lady leaves

462
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:32,357
You won't be able to see the new world.
You'll see it in the eyes of the kids

463
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,524
They see the new world

464
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:38,824
A new order won't happen on its own...
the children will establish it

465
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,306
You were born beggars
and you will die beggars!

466
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,240
But why must you make
beggars out of the children?

467
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,562
Who hit you, Chacha?

468
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:20,175
l'll give him a thrashing!
l'll beat him to pulp!

469
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,312
l'll beat him!

470
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:27,674
Let me go, Chacha

471
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,692
''My little boy...
what do you hold in your fist?''

472
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:39,292
''ln my fist is my destiny''

473
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,163
''l have my destiny
under my own control''

474
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:54,603
''What do your innocent eyes see?''

475
00:46:58,448 --> 00:47:02,043
''Our eyes see hope of joyful times''

476
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:09,585
''We dream beautiful dreams
of the times to come''

477
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,933
''My little boy....
what do you hold in your fist?''

478
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,750
''Will you accept a diamond
given to you in alms?''

479
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:45,484
''What will you do
with the tears life gives you?''

480
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,964
''We won't accept even a diamond
given to us in alms''

481
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,569
''Our tears we shall cherish''

482
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:12,088
''lt's fun to lead a life
overcoming hardships''

483
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:19,651
''My little boy....
what do you hold in your fist?''

484
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,016
''Do not hide it from me, children.
Do please tell me...''

485
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:48,017
''what kind of world are we
going to have in the future?''

486
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,263
''ln the future,
everybody will be king''

487
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:07,034
''Neither will the masses go hungry,
nor will grief prevail''

488
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,339
''The times will change...
that's what the stars foretell''

489
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,789
''My little boy....
what do you hold in your fist?''

490
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:29,057
''ln my fist is my destiny''

491
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,068
''l have my destiny
under my own control''

492
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,624
Well done, children

493
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,819
Don't ever open the fist to beg

494
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,626
Whatever happens, don't ever beg

495
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,360
Don't

496
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,094
So you're the one who doesn't
let them beg?

497
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:09,101
Bhola, go on...
go and get the money

498
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,842
Are you going, or aren't you?

499
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:23,916
So you are instigating them?
l'll see how they won't go

500
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,851
Don't you hit them!
- Shut up, lame duck

501
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,649
The hooch ruined your leg.
But you won't see sense

502
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,692
l'll see how you brainwash them.
Come on

503
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,134
Well, Chacha...?
No booze today?

504
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,303
Enough of bittergourd, eh?
- Don't interfere, Chitku

505
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,576
And stop seeing Kamla,
or you'll go to prison

506
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,940
My foot!

507
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,153
Wastrels! The two of you
are bent on killing me!

508
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,153
What are you waiting for?
Cook some rice

509
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:11,491
lf l see you with that old fossil ever
again, l'm going to break your legs!

510
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:15,966
lf you don't bring 10 annas by tomorrow
evening, don't even come here again

511
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,441
Get that? You will bring the money?

512
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,167
Why don't you speak?
- l'll get the money, aunt

513
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,344
l surely will

514
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,979
We've got to make 10 annas today.
- Else, aunt will beat us

515
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,918
Hello, Chitku.
- Hello

516
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,389
So you've stopped begging
and gone into business?

517
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,993
Yes, Chitku.
- Your aunt knows what you're up to?

518
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,393
No, Chitku. Please don't tell aunt...
- Don't tell her, big deal

519
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,693
That'll cost you 4 annas every day.
- Not 4 annas, Chitku

520
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,870
We'll give you an anna.
- Shut up

521
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,771
l want 4 annas every evening, okay?
Else, l'll fix you

522
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,013
Polish, sir?

523
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,217
Polish, memsaab?

524
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,227
Munna! l've found him!

525
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:19,229
Where's the brown polish?
- Use the black one, but hurry up

526
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,240
Give that to me

527
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,243
Hurry, the train's about to arrive.
- We're almost through, sir

528
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:35,051
The train has arrived!
- One moment, sir

529
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:38,777
The train has arrived!
Hurry up

530
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,818
The train has arrived!
My shoes!

531
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,062
Money, sir...

532
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,930
l'll give you anna each.
Do a good job, okay?

533
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,274
What have you done?

534
00:53:05,081 --> 00:53:08,710
lt's terribly hot in Bombay.
- We're through, sir

535
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,446
Through? Give them both
an anna each

536
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:17,092
They've ruined my socks
and pajama!

537
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,758
Ask me to have my shoes
polished again

538
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:22,531
They can't even wash their faces
and they're out to polish shoes!

539
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,994
Where are they...? Get them

540
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:30,295
We'll have to be careful, Bhola.
Or we'll have to close shop

541
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,040
Absolutely

542
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:40,646
We'll give your shoes a shine, sir.
- All right, go ahead

543
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,978
Take off your shoes, sir.
- Hurry up

544
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,791
Who's the insolent?

545
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,998
ls this your shoe?
Aren't you ashamed?

546
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:05,038
What's happening here?
- The rascal

547
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:08,344
What have you done?
- What am l to do?

548
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:13,942
l can't polish shoes.
- Whoever asked you to?

549
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,582
You'll know when someone
gives you thrashing

550
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,356
l'll be careful henceforth, Belu.
Let's go, come on

551
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,959
Boy, come here.
- Polish, sir?

552
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:35,361
Do you have polish for these shoes?
- Yes, sir. Black or brown?

553
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,376
Where's your feet-rest?
- Fee-fee? Right here, sir

554
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,046
We'll run it on your shoes, sir.

555
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:50,377
A feet-rest!
- Keep your foot on my thigh, sir

556
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,893
Put some

557
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:07,894
lt's a canvas shoe and we've
applied polish on it!

558
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,066
Quiet

559
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,551
What have you done, boy?
You've ruined my shoe!

560
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,016
Forgive me, sir...
- Forgive me?

561
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:27,855
Don't you know what it is
to polish a shoe?

562
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,581
Don't you know?

563
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,200
Bhola! You're crying?

564
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:49,135
l can't polish shoes... l won't!
l can't do it

565
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:52,607
How can you throw away
your things like this Bhola?

566
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:58,451
You'll learn it, Bhola.
Everybody learns, so will we gradually

567
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:03,118
Don't cry, Bhola.
Listen, let's go to John Chacha

568
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,791
He'll show us how to polish shoes

569
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,794
Don't cry, Bhola.
Don't cry

570
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:14,196
Come on. Come

571
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:32,385
Come Bhola, Belu...

572
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:34,820
l'll teach you an
English song today

573
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,288
You'll sing with me, won't you?

574
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:48,827
What happened, Belu?
What happened...?

575
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,074
He hit him.
- Hit him?

576
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,841
He hit Bhola.
- Which rascal hit him?

577
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:59,908
We ruined his trousers, Chacha.
- Ruined his trousers?

578
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,516
He was wearing canvas shoes and
we applied brown polish on it

579
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,888
You went and applied brown polish
on canvas shoes...?

580
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,521
Chacha, l don't know
how to polish shoes

581
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,531
l won't polish shoes, Chacha.
l can't do it

582
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,200
No, my son.
You must never lose courage

583
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,332
Everybody finds a new business
to be difficult initially

584
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,333
You'll learn it. You surely will.
Look at me

585
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:29,033
l couldn't play the instrument.
But l worked hard and now l play it

586
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,313
l'll show you how
to polish shoes

587
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:38,250
A nice way too...
like they massage my head

588
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,188
Suppose this is a foot-path
with people and cars passing by

589
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:47,657
And along comes a gentleman.
How will you approach him?

590
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,735
First-class polish...
absolutely super

591
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:56,403
And who else comes along?
A Hindu priest

592
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:01,106
Say, ''Namaskar, priest. l'll give
your shoes a great lndian polish''

593
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:05,346
But remember to spare his socks.
Also keep out the trousers and dhotis

594
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,945
A great polish!

595
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,345
For black shoes...?
- The black polish

596
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,588
For brown shoes?
- The brown polish

597
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,020
And canvas shoes...
- We don't want it!

598
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,358
Well said! Now go ahead and
get on with it, okay?

599
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,730
''Wait a while before you go away...''

600
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,833
''listen gentlemen,
black and white...''

601
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:02,128
''We've been waiting for a long time.
We, the shoe-shine boys''

602
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,605
''Wait a while before you go away...''

603
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,936
''listen gentlemen,
black and white...''

604
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:15,347
''We've been waiting for a long time.
We, the shoe-shine boys''

605
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,468
''One anna for the black polish''

606
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,465
''One anna for the brown polish''

607
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,672
''One anna for a massage
of the shoes''

608
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:39,204
''Pay an anna, and you'll
have everything''

609
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:45,404
''We have no riches, we wear no
grand turbans nor gold bangles''

610
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:52,050
''Ours is a small business...
we're the gay shoe-shine children''

611
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,356
''Wait a while before you go away...''

612
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,492
''listen gentlemen,
black and white...''

613
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:02,925
''We've been waiting for a long time.
We, the shoe-shine boys''

614
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,948
''Sweet is the fruit
of hard work''

615
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:28,790
''Very true''

616
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,292
''Left-overs and crumbs...''

617
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,392
''we don't want any''

618
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,798
''Bread earned out of hard work...''

619
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,796
''is welcome''

620
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:40,031
''And goodies that come for free...''

621
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,726
''we don't want''

622
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:46,135
''Shame on those who
gorge on ill-gotten food''

623
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:50,468
''We're hardworking
shoe-shine children''

624
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:52,815
''Wait a while before you go away...''

625
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,050
''listen gentlemen,
black and white...''

626
01:00:55,251 --> 01:01:01,417
''We've been waiting for a long time.
We, the shoe-shine boys''

627
01:01:16,806 --> 01:01:20,765
''The priest does the rituals;
he makes you get the holy bath''

628
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,975
''We work for a living...''

629
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,444
''we give your shoes a shine''

630
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,551
''The priest asks for a lot''

631
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,787
''We ask for just an anna''

632
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:36,056
''What discrimination then...?
- When everybody loves the money''

633
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:42,453
''We don't understand the difference...
we're the shoe-shine guys''

634
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,696
''Wait a while before you go away...''

635
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,300
''listen gentlemen,

636
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:53,534
''We've been waiting for a long time.
We, the shoe-shine boys''

637
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,194
Red and white...?
What a sight!

638
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:53,263
Black eyes, long hair and a
lovely red flush on the cheeks

639
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:59,671
What beauty!
Like a newly polished sandal

640
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,874
Get lost!

641
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,237
l say, what are Bhola and Belu up to
behind your back?

642
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,547
What are they up to?
- He's pulling wool over your eyes

643
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,879
You're applying kohl and they've
even stopped begging nowadays

644
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,229
You're back...?
Where were you all this while?

645
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:25,224
And Chitku says, behind my back...
- Behind your lovely back!

646
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,898
What are you hiding from me?
- lt's nothing, aunt

647
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,334
l've made 10 annas today.
- 10 annas! How come?

648
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,166
Show me.
- Ten annas, l say...

649
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,911
l'm giving you an anna.
- l want 4 annas!

650
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:38,508
All right!

651
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:41,717
So what were you saying, Chitku?
- Nothing

652
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,349
l've found a room for you.
- Really?

653
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,813
You must beg like this
every day, Bhola

654
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:50,718
Bring 10 annas tomorrow also.
- l'll be late tomorrow, okay?

655
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:54,588
l say come back before sunset, love

656
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,932
Out with the four paise

657
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,933
Coming!

658
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:04,269
l hid four annas in this, Bhola.
Know what we'll do with it?

659
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,610
What will we do if Chitku tells aunt
about our new business?

660
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,344
We'll deal with it, when it happens.
We'll buy a new shirt for you

661
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,673
This one's in tatters.
- No. Your frock comes first, Belu

662
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,953
No, your shirt comes first.
This frock will last many more days

663
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:22,954
Let's not argue... let's go to
John Chacha, he'll settle it for us

664
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:48,975
What is the matter, children?
- Keep this brush and polish, Chacha

665
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:52,652
Or aunt...
- She wants you to beg forever

666
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:56,054
But we've stopped begging, Chacha.
- Yes, Chacha

667
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,461
Really? And l didn't even get to know
that you've stopped begging

668
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,296
Here, have some grams

669
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:07,002
Decide something for us, Uncle.
lsn't he wearing a torn shirt?

670
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,598
lsn't it a torn one?
- Yes

671
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,806
So l asked him to buy a new shirt

672
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:14,008
He can buy it with the money
we've made out of shining shoes

673
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,811
But he just won't agree!
- Why not?

674
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:21,009
l told her Chacha, that my shirt
will last many more days

675
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,015
Her frock is torn. So let's
buy a new frock for her

676
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,422
But she won't agree.
- l said you're buying a new shirt!

677
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,691
So how can you interfere?
- Big deal!

678
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:34,018
We're buying you a new red frock.
- No way!

679
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:37,292
Once l say something, it's final.
l don't want anymore arguments!

680
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,534
What are you fighting for?

681
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:43,029
You buy a shirt.
And you buy a frock. That's all

682
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:47,474
All we have is four annas, Chacha

683
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,676
We can only buy a shirt for Bhola.
lsn't it?

684
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:57,710
Four annas?
lt can do nothing for anyone

685
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,782
Why? Does a shirt cost
more money, Chacha?

686
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:05,059
Yes, dear. lt costs a lot.
lt costs 3 or 4 rupees

687
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:09,561
For you, l would...

688
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,624
Do you have any hooch, Chacha?
- What?

689
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:17,062
We were coming here Chacha, and there
was this man in the street...

690
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,274
Not man. He looked like a ghost!
- Ghost?

691
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,306
He said...
- Get me a bottle of hooch

692
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,876
He promised us 5 rupees.
- l said l didn't know

693
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:29,079
What is hooch, Chacha?
- Hooch?

694
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:31,553
How'd l know what it is?

695
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,253
Which street was this chap in, Bhola?

696
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,885
He was...
- Near the palm tree. He doesn't know

697
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,363
Must've been someone. What have
l to do with a drunkard?

698
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:46,895
You kids run along now
and go to sleep

699
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:49,104
Chacha, just mind our
brush and polish

700
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:54,836
Won't you play the instrument?
- Sure, l will. Go on now. Go

701
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:30,145
l'll buy the children
a frock and a shirt

702
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,878
For Bhola and Belu.
l won't do it ever again, Lord

703
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,187
Here's it is...
memorable stuff

704
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,192
Belu, wake up...
the police have arrested John Chacha

705
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,189
The police have arrested him?
- Yes. Come on

706
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,536
This was the boy who
told you, isn't he?

707
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,935
No, lnspector. There's no one with me.
Quickly take me to the police station

708
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:38,611
Let John Chacha go, Constable.
Or l'll complain to my aunt!

709
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,216
Take them away too!
- No, Constable

710
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,212
These poor kids work hard
to earn living

711
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,680
They gave me no information.
Please take me along

712
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,284
All right. Let them go

713
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:54,923
Why do the police arrest you?
- Because l'm a bad man

714
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,958
l've committed a crime

715
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,359
But you must never do
something like this

716
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,902
Life is full of hardships,
but you ought to be brave

717
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,570
Belu... you're crying?
What for?

718
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:10,969
l'll be back soon. Very soon.
- What has John Chacha done, constable?

719
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,805
He's into bootlegging.
- He won't do it again

720
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:16,413
Am l right, Chacha?
- l'll never do it, my child. Never

721
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:19,245
Take him away.
- One moment

722
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:27,661
Give me a smile and tell me how
my bald pate will sprout hair

723
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,595
Give me a smile... go on.
- The bittergourd...

724
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,998
Come on, it's late already

725
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,722
Hey! Pedro!

726
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,791
John!

727
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:08,859
How come you're here?
- The old business

728
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,702
Hooch?

729
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,800
l told you not to do such things.
- This is the last time, Pedro

730
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,973
Never again.
- Never? Come

731
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:24,281
Meet the brothers...
- Who is he?

732
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,321
He's a very big man.
Sit down there. Go on

733
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,525
Lala Chhoturam. A 4-month term.

734
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,762
He's here for six months

735
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:38,665
That's Pestonji...
on an eight-month term

736
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:43,365
Maganbhai, he's here for 1 7 months.
- 1 7 months? Pleased to meet you

737
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,368
And me...!
- Chimanji! 15 days

738
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,974
ls that all?
- A month actually

739
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,075
All right. Go away.

740
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:54,308
Meet Professor Lobolo.
- What professor?

741
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,241
Of the brains.
- How come he's here?

742
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,984
He developed something
that would grow hair

743
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:05,655
He conned 300 men.
For the fraud, he was given 3 years

744
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,326
3 years? Wow, Professor!
l'm delighted to meet you

745
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,256
Please sit down

746
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,259
Professor, l'm very fond
of that oil you discovered

747
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:21,133
Have you hit upon any new formula?
- l have an entirely new concept

748
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:22,544
What?

749
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:26,942
lt has a bit of philosophy too.
- What's philosophy?

750
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,078
lt has to do with the brains

751
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:35,688
lt's a bit complicated.
- Tell us about it, Professor

752
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:38,026
Maybe we'll understand something

753
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:42,360
The only conclusion of everything
is the cloud and hair

754
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,360
Cloud and hair?

755
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:51,695
We don't get it, Professor.
- Clouds are dark, so is hair

756
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:55,710
lnvoke the clouds...
maybe you'll even grow hair

757
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,873
What a silly philosophy.
- Not at all

758
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:03,878
l get what you're saying.
l sure do. Come here and sit down

759
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,518
Clouds mean water
and the other thing is hair

760
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,323
The hair will grow when
the clouds pour, right?

761
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,629
Right!
- But how will it pour water?

762
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,731
That's the beauty of the whole thing!
Come and sit down

763
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,463
lt has to do with practice,
with preparation

764
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:24,603
Have you heard of Tansen?
- Oh yes!

765
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,737
He caused rainfall, did you know?
- Yes

766
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,500
Now listen

767
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,701
''Pounce on it''

768
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:05,869
''Come hither, O rains...''

769
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:09,770
''the fields, our bald pates,
are parched''

770
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,909
''So pour on us''

771
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:49,140
''Bring water...''

772
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:53,146
''strike lightning''

773
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,189
''lf you have no rains...''

774
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:31,182
''fetch some from the river-banks''

775
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:02,883
''The nightingale sings
in the forests...''

776
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:06,625
''every heart craves''

777
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:35,155
''Give us a bountiful of hair''

778
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:42,419
''Come pouring quickly''

779
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,645
''Come pouring''

780
00:04:40,456 --> 00:04:42,788
''Come pouring''

781
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:53,325
''Pour...''

782
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:07,783
Step away!

783
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:11,344
This is amazing!
- What happened?

784
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:13,512
l made a mistake, Pedro!

785
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:21,152
l have invoked a storm. What will
happen to Bhola and Belu?

786
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:23,694
What happens of the
poor in the slums?

787
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:35,270
Give it to me, Belu.

788
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,805
Don't fall, Bhola.
l'm terribly scared

789
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:42,151
Don't be afraid, Belu. l'm all right.
Give that to me

790
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,199
Bhola, l'm feeling very cold

791
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,679
Why must it rain so heavily?

792
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:17,216
Mind the kid, lady...
He's getting drenched

793
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:23,653
Why don't we have a mother?
When will she come?

794
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,226
Mother? She'll come...

795
00:06:28,698 --> 00:06:32,429
with the new dawn...
when it's bright outside

796
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:38,098
Our mother will come then.
She surely will

797
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:44,102
Mother will come when it's dawn?
Will she...? Mother...

798
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,451
Mother!

799
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,662
Good morning

800
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,733
Have a cup of tea.

801
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:15,010
lt rained heavily last night.
- So much more happened too

802
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,139
John Chacha's gone to jail.
- A good thing too

803
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:23,143
The government must never set him
free. He's a very dangerous man

804
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,481
Not as dangerous as you are.
- Here you are

805
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:30,048
At least pay for the tea.
- Pay for it?

806
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,090
Are you selling tea now?
- You could say that

807
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,157
My business is all over.
- Why?

808
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:39,501
Those serpents in your house...
- What?

809
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:42,236
Nothing.
- Tell me

810
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:47,174
Bhola and Belu are into shoe-shining
nowadays. They don't beg

811
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:51,307
l see! They must've hidden
money from me

812
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,648
Nobody would give them even 2 annas
in the monsoons. Look at my state

813
00:07:57,086 --> 00:08:00,055
When they begged, they made
at least a rupee or two annas

814
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,324
But now, they won't even
bring 10 annas a day

815
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,321
They think they can live off me!

816
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:07,528
l'll throw them out, even if
that's the last thing l ever do!

817
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:12,197
You're too much...
oh, what a beauty

818
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,200
Mother...

819
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:20,538
Bloody wretch! You swallowed your
mother, the day you were born!

820
00:08:21,143 --> 00:08:24,112
Where's the brush and the polish?
Chitku has told me everything

821
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,710
l earn money for a livelihood
and you act smart with me?

822
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:31,085
Get the hell out of here!

823
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,887
Don't come back here,
if you don't have the money!

824
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:42,428
Bhola, l'm feeling a chill

825
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,568
Belu! You have a fever!

826
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:50,902
Aunt! Open the door...
Belu's running a fever!

827
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:37,415
Bhola! Where will we sleep?
What will we get to eat?

828
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,115
Belu, don't be afraid

829
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:44,217
John Chacha asked us to be brave.
Remember?

830
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:48,424
Come, Belu. l'll get to work

831
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,967
Here you are.
- ls it okay?

832
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:00,642
Come

833
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:12,645
Polish, sir?
- Get lost! What polish in the rains?

834
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:20,662
Please give me a cup of tea.
- Do you have the money?

835
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,960
l don't have any money.
- So get lost

836
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:31,666
l'll do a great polish, sir...

837
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,142
How can l have my shoes
polished in the rains?

838
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,672
l'll miss my train.
Don't be a pest

839
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,485
Polish, sir?

840
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,688
Who gets his shoes polished
in the rains?

841
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,086
Here's what l'm wearing.
Get going

842
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:22,749
Bhola, l'm terribly hungry

843
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,458
l feel as if l'll die
out of hunger

844
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:33,998
Your fever has increased, Belu.
What am l to do...?

845
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,366
What am l to do, God?
- l'm going to die, Bhola

846
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:43,738
You'll be happy then?
- No, you mustn't say such things

847
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,546
Sit down here. l'll find someone
who'll have his shoes polished. Sit

848
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:51,316
Polish, sir?

849
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:54,189

00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:59,090

Sir, l'll do a very nice polish!
Give me just 2 paisas, sir!

852
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,869
Does anyone have his shoes
polished in the rains?

853
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:11,106
Your polish will get washed away.
What's the use?

854
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:15,500
Why don't you do something else?
- l'll give you a nice polish, sir

855
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,371
A very nice polish, in just 2 paisa...
- What a mad boy

856
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,445
Why must l have my shoes polished?
You want money, no? Here you are

857
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:26,586
No, sir... l can't take this money.
l want work!

858
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,119
l'll give you a polish, sir...
- Take it, son

859
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:35,194

- You're begging!

860
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,799
l'm terribly hungry.
l'm very hungry

861
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,212
Hungry? You'd rather die!

862
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:55,214
Bhola, l'm very hungry!

863
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:02,680
Look, Bhola...
there are so many shoes out there

864
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:09,681
Yes, Belu. When it stops pouring,
l'll polish all those shoes

865
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:13,892
And l'll bring hot tea for you.
Steaming hot

866
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,696
l'll also bring bread...
you will eat it, won't you?

867
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:25,702
Polish, sir? l'll do a nice job, sir.
- Go away

868
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,772
Who gets his shoes polished
in the rains?

869
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,706
Polish, sir? l'll do a nice job

870
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:40,644
Come, let's go to Buribunder.
l'll surely find work there

871
00:15:01,977 --> 00:15:04,207
Polish, sir?
- Go away

872
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,974
lt's over, sir. l'm through.
- Who asked you to polish the shoes?

873
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,970
l've done a nice job, sir.
Please give me an anna?

874
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,482
Get lost!

875
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:49,119
Boy... take this
- Thank you, sir.

876
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:54,462
Belu, get up. l'll buy something
for you to eat

877
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,997
Money?
- Look

878
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,174
Bhola, what are you doing here?

879
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,809
Out to polish shoes
on a day like this?

880
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,006
lt's so crowded during the rains...

881
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:16,514
even if you cut a throat,
nobody gets to know

882
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,252
My word!

883
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:22,818
lf only you had bought a scissor
instead of brush and polish...

884
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:25,754
it would end your miseries.
See you then

885
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:34,502
l'm very hungry, Bholu.
- Sit here, Belu

886
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,771
l'll go and get something for you.

887
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,030
l'll be back in a minute

888
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:46,039
A cup of tea and bread for me.
- Here you are

889
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,656
My wallet! Someone
has picked my pocket!

890
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,595
Run away, Bhola!
Look, the police!

891
00:17:07,102 --> 00:17:08,399
Over there!

892
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,269
Don't let the boy get away!

893
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:14,575
After him!

894
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:17,811
Belu! Get up and run!
lt's the police!

895
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:19,671
Run, Belu!

896
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,278
Constable, Belu's in there.
- There's no Belu here!

897
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:55,879
Please open the gate...
my sister's in there!

898
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,085
Get lost!

899
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,850
You love children, don't you?

900
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:34,480
And look at our luck.
After seven years of marriage...

901
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:37,953
Which l why l ask you...
- To marry again?

902
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:41,158
Silly woman

903
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,169
You're not hurt, are you?

904
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:53,169
l'm hungry...
please call Bhola

905
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:59,981
l'm hungry.
- The poor girl's burning with fever

906
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:04,981
Who are you?
- She seems to be an orphan

907
00:19:05,787 --> 00:19:08,984
She must be hungry.
- Give the poor girl some money

908
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,292
She'll buy something to eat.
- All right

909
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:15,194
Take this, dear.
- No

910
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:19,359
l don't want alms.
Bhola will be angry

911
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:25,000
Please call Bhola...
- Bhola, who?

912
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:30,211
Bhola... l'm hungry, Bhola...

913
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:34,404
The poor girl has fainted
out of fever

914
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:42,621
The police have left, Belu!

915
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:55,225
l'll buy berries for you, Belu.
And a red frock too

916
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,898
Where have you gone away, Belu?
Where will l look for you?

917
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:16,256
How's she now?
- The fever has subsided

918
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:21,058
But she's still delirious...
and she seems to be very frightened

919
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:24,595
No, Bhola... no

920
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:30,929
Mother...

921
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,603
Mother...

922
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,269
Mother will come...
when a new day dawns

923
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,297
You? Haven't you left?

924
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,634
l've lost my sister...
have you seen her?

925
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:02,628
What sister?
- Belu. My sister is lost

926
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:05,632
She must be in there. Let me see...
- Go away, get lost

927
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:13,307
Baba, have you seen Belu around?
- No son

928
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,984
Why're you yelling?
Don't you care for my health?

929
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,329
Has Belu returned?
- No, damn you

930
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,357
Have you brought the money?

931
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:33,596
Don't hit me, aunt...
Belu has gone missing

932
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,133
l'm glad l'm rid of her!
Why don't you die too?

933
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:38,202
Worthless boy! Go away!

934
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,338
lf you don't get the money,
don't ever come back here

935
00:21:41,776 --> 00:21:43,141
Aunt!

936
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,338
Don't let Belu go anywhere,
if she returns

937
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:53,612
l'll die without her, aunt.
Don't let her go anywhere

938
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:16,174
''What land are you headed for
in those fineries, my girl?''

939
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:22,880
''l go to the land of my beloved
in these fineries''

940
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:36,386
''What land are you headed for
in those fineries, my girl?''

941
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,807
''Tears flow from
your parents eyes''

942
00:22:56,585 --> 00:23:00,419
''Friends from your childhood
cry at the separation''

943
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:11,932
''Your brother calls out for you...''

944
00:23:12,234 --> 00:23:15,431
''don't leave your house''

945
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:22,032
''l go to my beloved's land
in these fineries''

946
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:28,438
''What land are you headed for
in those fineries, my girl?''

947
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:49,793
''My beloved's land is oh so far away''

948
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:58,275
''l belong to him
and he's my beloved''

949
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:09,079
''l was tied in love...''

950
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:12,823
''after a lot of thought''

951
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:19,489
''l go to the land of my beloved
in these fineries''

952
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:25,838
''What land are you headed for
in those fineries, my girl?''

953
00:24:37,252 --> 00:24:41,211
You will live with us, won't you?
We'll give you a lot of love

954
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:45,192
You're wearing a nice frock

955
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,757
What is your name?
You still haven't told us

956
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,526
Tell us your name... Go on

957
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:59,263
You will stay with us, won't you?
- l'm going back to Bhola

958
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:04,536
Bhola? Who's that, dear?
- Bhola... my brother

959
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,048
So you have a brother too?
- Oh yes

960
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:12,546
How can we keep her with us Lata?
lt's against the law

961
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:16,286
And we don't even know whether
she has her parents or not

962
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:18,821
l have a feeling
that she has no one

963
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:22,893
Where do you live, dear?
- Over there... with Bhola

964
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:26,162
The car has returned
from the garage, sir

965
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:28,068
Go and fetch my coat

966
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,362
Let's go and find out
about her today

967
00:25:30,672 --> 00:25:32,970
ls it okay if you went to
the office a bit late today?

968
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,176
You will take us to your house,
won't you?

969
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:41,311
All right. Get ready

970
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:44,585
Come, dear.
- Get the car out, Shyamu

971
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:48,580
We're going to Bhola, aren't we?
- Yes, we're going to Bhola

972
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:02,833
Come...

973
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:09,801
Watch it, dear

974
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:19,186
Run! lt's the ticket-checker!

975
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:22,623
Come on

976
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:29,862
Wait there... what have
you gotten me into?

977
00:26:30,398 --> 00:26:32,628
Wait there, dear...
watch your step

978
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:35,636
Watch your step

979
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:41,108
Aunt! Open the door!
- So you're back screaming!

980
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:45,373
l've brought sweets for Bhola, aunt.
For you too

981
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:49,149
What airs have you put on
in a single night?

982
00:26:49,684 --> 00:26:53,176
ls she your child?
- No! She's an orphan

983
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:57,254
She used to live with me...
has she committed a theft?

984
00:26:57,592 --> 00:27:01,153
No, we're the ones who committed
a theft ... by keeping her with us

985
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,998
We wish to keep her with us

986
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:09,003
We wish to adopt her.
- Will you give her away to us?

987
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:17,406
Why not? But l've brought her up.
l've faced so many hardships...

988
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,012
you know, it really hurts me
to give her away to you

989
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,687
Do you want to adopt another child?

990
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:30,015
No, we want just her...
let's go, dear

991
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,693
Take Bhola along too!
- All right, we'll take him along too

992
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:37,359
Where is Bhola?
- That was her brother

993
00:27:37,732 --> 00:27:40,292
He died a few days ago
and she weeps for him

994
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:41,932
He's dead?

995
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:47,433
Let's go, dear.
- No, l won't go without Bhola

996
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:50,711
l want to go to Bhola...
- Bhola will be coming, dear. C'mon

997
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,442
So go away!
- You don't have to yell at her

998
00:27:54,816 --> 00:27:57,250
Let's go...
- l want to go to Bhola!

999
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:22,743
Lord, my wish has been fulfilled

1000
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:26,344
With Your grace,
l now have a daughter

1001
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:29,345
Thanks a million, Lord

1002
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:33,084
Belu has gone missing, Lord.
lf l find her...

1003
00:28:33,454 --> 00:28:35,752
l'll offer You a day's
shoe-shine earning

1004
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,264
l won't forget Your favour
all my life, Lord

1005
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:53,774
You take some too, son

1006
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:12,656
May your folks die! Why couldn't
you tell us a day in advance?

1007
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:17,556
A day? We told you six months ago
to clear these slums

1008
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,800
Clear the slums and take them where?
Place them on your head?

1009
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,965
Move to Marine Drive, lady

1010
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:26,797
Oh yes, your father owns the place.
Doesn't he?

1011
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:31,077
l say, there's a room available
in Sadhuram's tenement

1012
00:29:31,546 --> 00:29:33,810
l'm saying it for your own good

1013
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:37,151
There's a room in Sadhuram's tenement.
Do you hear that?

1014
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,080
l could show it to you.
- Where?

1015
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,484
Out there, Kamla. You can have
a great gathering there

1016
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:48,088
Why would l take a whole room for
myself? Especially without Kamla

1017
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,961
So what do you think?
- What's the rent?

1018
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:55,634
Why bother about rent? Sadhuram
won't fleece you, will he?

1019
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:58,837
lt's just 5 rupees.
- But l'm not giving you any space

1020
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:06,836
Aunt... has Belu returned?
Has my Belu returned, aunt?

1021
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:10,851
So you're back?
- No, aunt

1022
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:13,848
l only came to ask if Belu was back

1023
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:16,190
Where do you think you're going?

1024
00:30:16,891 --> 00:30:19,189
lt's because of you that
l've got to leave this place

1025
00:30:19,494 --> 00:30:22,224
Pick up all that stuff!

1026
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:28,597
Pick it up... you'll find
a lot of shoes to polish there

1027
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:33,271
Die! Don't you get to eat?

1028
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,672
You're not hurt, are you?
- No

1029
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:47,885
''About my heart l spoke...''

1030
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,881
''all night''

1031
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:59,890
''Separated from you,
l couldn't go to sleep...''

1032
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:03,165
''all night''

1033
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:24,356
''l'm the mischievous Queen
of Spring''

1034
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:28,258
''The world is crazy about me''

1035
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:35,936
''l'm the mischievous Queen
of Spring''

1036
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:44,238
''The world is crazy about me''

1037
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,064
''l plunder hearts
with my piercing eye...''

1038
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,961
''l kick up a storm
every lane l pass through''

1039
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:26,978
''l'm adept at weaving tales''

1040
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,792
''The world is crazy about me''

1041
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,363
''l'm the mischievous Queen
of Spring''

1042
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:02,216
''My charm is unique''

1043
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:06,419
''lt sates your love...
and empties your pockets''

1044
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:24,641
''To give away the heart
is to court sorrow''

1045
00:33:25,146 --> 00:33:28,445
''The world is crazy about me''

1046
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:36,056
''l'm the mischievous Queen
of Spring''

1047
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:52,402
''Let people die,
for all l care...''

1048
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:56,541
''l'll continue my merry-making''

1049
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:14,756
''l've got to make
my own world...''

1050
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:18,696
''The world is crazy about me''

1051
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:26,104
''l'm the mischievous Queen
of Spring''

1052
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:43,852
She's now your mother and
this is your father, dear

1053
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:46,123
This is your house

1054
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:50,128
Get lost!
- What happened?

1055
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,836
What else? He keeps loafing about the
whole day, and gives me just 4 annas...

1056
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,730
expecting me to give him two meals
and a roof over his head

1057
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:03,132
l ask him to beg, he'll make more
money. But he wants to shine shoes!

1058
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:07,138
Dog! Get lost!
And don't you come back!

1059
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:10,651
You're dead, for all l care.
Understand?

1060
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:39,976
Belu, where are you going?

1061
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:45,777
Where were you going?
Where, tell me?

1062
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,848
To Bhola.
- To Bhola?

1063
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:54,185
Come, l'll take you to Bhola.
- No, l want to go to Bhola

1064
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:56,430
Why hasn't he come?
l want to go back to him

1065
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,997
Of course, dear. l'll take you
to Bhola right now. At once

1066
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:12,907
Lata, how long will we hide the truth?
We'll have to tell her some day

1067
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:21,921
My child... don't you
like this place at all?

1068
00:36:23,257 --> 00:36:28,752
Don't you like it here at all?
- l'm going back to Bhola...

1069
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:33,233
Don't you love this mother?

1070
00:36:41,275 --> 00:36:42,537
Mother!

1071
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:19,268
You won't even let me sleep in peace.
You're always a nuisance, John Chacha

1072
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,843
Nuisance? Why don't you say l'm
killing the mosquitoes in the jail?

1073
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:28,781
Killing them, my foot!
l've been in this cell for 5 years

1074
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:35,293
5 years! l've spent 25 years here
in terms of 2 and 4 months. Know that?

1075
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:39,095
You're a 5-year old kid
and l'm young man of 25

1076
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,701
Who's that? Come on in

1077
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:45,464
What's happening, John?
- Not much, constable

1078
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:49,032
This has to do with my honour.
This 5-year old kid...

1079
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:53,302
is insulting a young man of 25.
- Go away. You've been let off

1080
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:55,842
Let off?
- Yes

1081
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,648
l had a nice time,
but l'm not coming back again

1082
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:01,319
Really? So the jail has
reformed you at last

1083
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:06,986
lt isn't the jail, constable.
lt's the love of those children

1084
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,320
But you won't understand.
- Go on

1085
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:15,927
John Chacha? You've eaten enough
bittergourd here, haven't you?

1086
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,999
So you're here? l told you
to stop seeing Kamla

1087
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:23,068
Should l have seen you
instead, Chacha?

1088
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:26,844
l'd still have had to come here.
- What's his crime, sir?

1089
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:30,345
lf there was one, l'd tell. Move it!
- One moment

1090
00:38:31,385 --> 00:38:36,948
Chitku, how are Bhola and Belu?
- Everything there is ruined, Chacha

1091
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:40,360
The lady sold Bhola and Belu
to a rich man

1092
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,754
Sold them?
- Yes. For only a hundred rupees

1093
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:45,031
You know Sadhuram who owns
the tenement?

1094
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,690
He's an acquaintance of his.
Ask him, he'll tell you everything

1095
00:38:48,002 --> 00:38:49,833
Move it. lt's late already

1096
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:59,746
What are you looking at my face for?
Polish my shoes quickly

1097
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:03,650
l've got to go to the movies.
Are you through?

1098
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,379
How much is that?
- 2 annas, sir

1099
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:09,886
2 annas...?
Taxi, wait here

1100
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:14,394
The cab's going away...
here's the two annas

1101
00:39:15,162 --> 00:39:18,188
Hey cabbie! Wait for me

1102
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:28,406
To Regal Cinema, driver.
And make it quick

1103
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,408
Mister...
- What is it?

1104
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:36,416
Come here, son

1105
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,082
You're such a nice boy

1106
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:43,416
Here you are.
- No thank you

1107
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:46,419
Take it. Buy yourself some sweets.
Let's go

1108
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:49,028
Hey mister...

1109
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:10,945
A red frock

1110
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:15,114
What do you want?
- l want that red frock, sir

1111
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,457
Do you have the money?
- Yes, sir. Here it is

1112
00:40:17,658 --> 00:40:19,956
Not 2 rupees.
That frock is worth 5 rupees

1113
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,128
Sweet berries

1114
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:30,060
What is it? Get lost

1115
00:40:30,404 --> 00:40:32,372
l want those berries.
- How much?

1116
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:34,574
Give me the whole lot.
- The whole lot? Are you mad?

1117
00:40:34,842 --> 00:40:37,140
lt's worth 2 rupees.
- Here you are

1118
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:42,141
All right, here you are...
take away the basket too

1119
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:47,478
How much for the berries?
- 4 for an anna

1120
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:49,489
Here you are

1121
00:40:54,261 --> 00:40:56,229
Sweet berries...

1122
00:41:03,537 --> 00:41:06,836
How much for the berries?
- 4 for an anna, sir

1123
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,509
Give me eight annas worth

1124
00:41:28,729 --> 00:41:32,529
Belu, where have you gone away?

1125
00:41:37,571 --> 00:41:39,266
Write, my child

1126
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:43,940
''A'' ... as in aam (mango)

1127
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,880
And ''B'' as in basta (bag).
- Not bag... berries

1128
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:55,212
So you like berries?
- l love them

1129
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,113
l don't like chocolates

1130
00:41:57,324 --> 00:42:00,225
Papa brings chocolates every day.
Why doesn't he bring berries?

1131
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:02,824
He'll bring berries too, my child.
He forgets, you see

1132
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,554
l'll ask him to bring berries
for my Belu every day

1133
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:08,060
A lot of berries. Okay?
Write now

1134
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:24,579
Write dear... what are you
thinking about?

1135
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:35,253
''A'' as in ''Aam''...
''B'' as in berries

1136
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:39,588
and ''C''...
- Chacha! John Chacha!

1137
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:42,601
Renu! Where are you going?

1138
00:42:45,038 --> 00:42:47,404
My Belu is missing; she's said
to be staying somewhere here

1139
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:49,438
Has anyone of you seen her?
- No

1140
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:51,611
l searched everywhere for her,
but l couldn't find her

1141
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:54,607
Please tell me if you get to know.
She's just like you

1142
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:07,620
Where were you, John Chacha?
l looked so much for you!

1143
00:43:08,162 --> 00:43:10,357
Bhola wasn't around, nor were you.
Where did you go away, Chacha?

1144
00:43:10,798 --> 00:43:14,632
Where had you disappeared, Belu?
And these clothes...

1145
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:19,505
you look like a princess.
- l live right here, Chacha. Come on

1146
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,638
You live here?
- Come on

1147
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:27,640
Come on in Chacha.
You'd like to see my house, no?

1148
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,176
Certainly. Why not?
- Come on

1149
00:43:31,418 --> 00:43:33,648
Look, Chacha...
isn't it beautiful?

1150
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:37,384
Mother... come...

1151
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,421
Mother, this is John Chacha.
We used to live with him

1152
00:43:42,763 --> 00:43:45,061
He's a wonderful person, Mother

1153
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:51,460
What's that greeting, Chacha?
Say namaste to her

1154
00:43:53,774 --> 00:43:57,301
So you are the folks who have...?
- Yes. We have adopted her

1155
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:01,178
You've done a very nice thing...
a very noble gesture indeed

1156
00:44:03,717 --> 00:44:05,480
Please come in

1157
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,681
Yes, Chacha. Come on in... come!

1158
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,159
Come, Chacha...

1159
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:18,289
l'll show you beautiful toys...
l have so many toys!

1160
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:21,860
l have so many lovely frocks...
all of them are red!

1161
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,692
Come, Chacha

1162
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:26,505
And look, Chacha.
l've even started studying

1163
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:29,435
''A'' as in ''aam''.
''B'' as in berries...

1164
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,103
And ''C'' as in...
- Chacha!

1165
00:44:32,846 --> 00:44:36,714
Come Chacha. Sit down

1166
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,709
Please sit there...
- No thank you

1167
00:44:41,088 --> 00:44:45,149
This is my place, you know.
- l'm sitting with you too

1168
00:44:46,026 --> 00:44:48,722
Want me to show you the frocks?
- Oh yes

1169
00:44:49,096 --> 00:44:51,394
And the dolls too?
- Oh certainly

1170
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:56,995
Where do you live?

1171
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:00,736
The whole of Bombay
is now my house

1172
00:45:01,308 --> 00:45:06,268
l used to be their neighbour.
These children... l loved them

1173
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,747
But where is Bhola?
- See, Chacha!

1174
00:45:09,983 --> 00:45:13,441
Lovely frocks...
these dolls!

1175
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:16,756
Belu, fetch something for
for your Chacha to eat

1176
00:45:17,124 --> 00:45:18,421
At once!

1177
00:45:19,793 --> 00:45:22,523
Please don't talk about Bhola
in Belu's presence

1178
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,658
She weeps so much whenever
she's reminded of him

1179
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:29,092
Why? What happened to Bhola?
- Look Chacha! Nice bread...

1180
00:45:29,503 --> 00:45:33,906
What's that? Bring some sweets,
fruits and tea for him

1181
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:37,210
Tell Shyamu. He'll bring it.
- Would you like sweets, Chacha?

1182
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:41,372
What happened to Bhola?
- Don't you know?

1183
00:45:41,815 --> 00:45:46,445
Bhola is dead.
- Bhola is dead? No...

1184
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,583
lmpossible! Who told you?

1185
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:51,789
We were told by that woman
from whom we adopted Belu

1186
00:45:52,826 --> 00:45:56,125
So Kamla told you...?
The liar! The devil!

1187
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,364
lf Kamla says Bhola is dead,
it means he's certainly alive

1188
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:02,358
l'll surely find Bhola.
l'll find him

1189
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:05,796
lf only we could find Bhola...
- Look at the goodies, Chacha

1190
00:46:06,173 --> 00:46:09,199
l'm feeding Chacha with my own hands!
Eat, Chacha

1191
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:12,603
l'll come again tomorrow, Belu.
You like berries, don't you?

1192
00:46:13,113 --> 00:46:15,809
l'll bring berries for you, okay?
- Okay

1193
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:21,685
Renu, l've brought berries
for you dear. You...?

1194
00:46:22,122 --> 00:46:24,488
This is Mr John;
he used to be Renu's neighbour

1195
00:46:24,858 --> 00:46:29,386
No! He's John Chacha!
- l'm very happy to have met you

1196
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:34,425
John Chacha is a very nice man, Papa.
- Certainly, dear. Please sit down

1197
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:37,496
Sit down, Chacha. Please sit down.
- l must go now, dear

1198
00:46:38,038 --> 00:46:40,836
Where will you go, Chacha?
l'm not letting you go away!

1199
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:43,005
l'll come again tomorrow

1200
00:46:44,277 --> 00:46:46,575
But we're leaving tomorrow

1201
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,178
You're leaving tomorrow?

1202
00:46:49,883 --> 00:46:52,647
Yes. We're going out of town
for a couple of months

1203
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:55,846
lt'll be a nice change for Renu...

1204
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,526
and we want her to forget
about her past life

1205
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:04,527
She must grow up to be a decent,
respectable and educated girl

1206
00:47:05,165 --> 00:47:07,258
That has been my desire too

1207
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:12,868
That these children study
and grow up to be good citizens

1208
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:16,042
l'm a very happy man today

1209
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,608
So l must leave now, Belu dear

1210
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,881
Where are you going, Chacha?
l'm not letting you go!

1211
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,878
Bhola's not here either...
l'm not letting you go!

1212
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:28,121
l'll come again...

1213
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:31,885
This is now your house, my child

1214
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:35,894
She's your Mama.
And he's your Papa

1215
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:38,563
You will find everything here

1216
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:41,492
And l have nothing
to give you, my child

1217
00:47:42,302 --> 00:47:44,896
l'll surely come to see you.
l surely will...

1218
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,238
Belu's going to study
and grow up...

1219
00:47:49,943 --> 00:47:54,073
and l'll surely come to see Belu!
- Chacha, don't go away!

1220
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:56,911
You won't be here...
nor will Bhola!

1221
00:48:07,294 --> 00:48:09,262
May you be happy, Belu

1222
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,098
But l'll surely bring Bhola

1223
00:48:18,972 --> 00:48:21,497
Buy me some berries, Papa.
- How much for the berries?

1224
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,209
2 for a paisa, sir.
- Give me an anna's worth

1225
00:48:30,317 --> 00:48:34,344
''Bhola sells it,
and Belu eats it...''

1226
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:39,550
''berries, everybody relishes''

1227
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:43,229
Sweet berries...

1228
00:48:52,272 --> 00:48:53,569
Wait!

1229
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:56,567
Give those berries! They're Belu's!
- Belu, who?

1230
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,639
My sister, sir. What will l tell her
when she comes asking, sir?

1231
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:02,982
Shut up and come on

1232
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:08,384
Hello, John Chacha.
When did you return?

1233
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:11,657
Have you seen Bhola around?
- No, l haven't

1234
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:29,802
What is your name?
- Bhola

1235
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,601
Where do you live?
- Nowhere

1236
00:49:34,648 --> 00:49:37,811
Don't you have a house?
And parents?

1237
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:41,016
Parents...?
- So you have no one

1238
00:49:42,055 --> 00:49:46,014
l had a sister, sir.
But she has gone missing too

1239
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,756
Don't cry. We'll send you
to an orphanage

1240
00:49:50,297 --> 00:49:55,030
Take him to Mr Sharma's orphanage.
- Come on

1241
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:58,434
Your name...
- Let them go, constable

1242
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:02,037
But listen... don't get into
business without a licence again

1243
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:12,848
This is now your house, my son.
We are your parents

1244
00:50:13,153 --> 00:50:15,053
You'll have everything here

1245
00:50:15,355 --> 00:50:18,051
Please let me go, sir...
l haven't done anything

1246
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:22,323
So why did the police bring you here?
- l was selling berries, sir

1247
00:50:22,762 --> 00:50:25,390
l thought my Belu would come
to buy the berries

1248
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:29,066
She loves berries, sir.
- Belu? Who's that?

1249
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:31,801
My younger sister.
We were into shoe-shining

1250
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:34,800
She went missing one day.
l looked everywhere...

1251
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:38,735
but l don't know where she is
and how she's managing

1252
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:52,683
You haven't packed your bag, Belu?
Hurry up, dear. Or we'll get late

1253
00:51:03,203 --> 00:51:07,230
l'm not going, Mother.
l don't feel like it

1254
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:09,768
You'll like it very much, my child

1255
00:51:10,143 --> 00:51:13,112
We'll teach you pony-riding,
take you sailing in a boat...

1256
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,474
there'll be so many nice children
to play with you

1257
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,818
You will come, won't you?

1258
00:51:20,053 --> 00:51:22,317
Aren't you ready yet, Lata?
lt's so late

1259
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:26,592
lt's already eleven and Seth Rai singh
must be waiting for us

1260
00:51:27,894 --> 00:51:30,863
What's wrong with her?
- Renu says she's not going

1261
00:51:32,165 --> 00:51:35,726
Why not? We're going out
only for her

1262
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:41,129
l'm not going. lf l go away,
there will be no one here

1263
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:45,144
What if Bhola comes calling?

1264
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:56,518
l told you that unless we took her away
she'd be reminded of all the old things

1265
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,489
How long will we hide it from her?
Why don't you tell her the truth?

1266
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,161
Renu, my child...
Bhola won't come anymore

1267
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,568
Of course not!
He'll surely come

1268
00:52:09,803 --> 00:52:14,604
No... how will l explain to you?
He's not coming anymore

1269
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:16,566
He'll never come again

1270
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:44,602
''We're your own...
from you, we seek mercy''

1271
00:52:45,138 --> 00:52:51,543
''We're your own children...
from you, we seek mercy''

1272
00:52:52,245 --> 00:52:58,548
''We pray for your loved ones''

1273
00:52:59,252 --> 00:53:05,816
''We pray for your loved ones''

1274
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:30,647
''ln a world of orphans,
perpetually plunged in darkness...''

1275
00:53:37,824 --> 00:53:44,662
''not once did we see a dawn''

1276
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:58,838
''On an evening like this,
for that thing which burns...''

1277
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:12,718
''we seek a lamp of hope''

1278
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:19,988
''We pray for your loved ones''

1279
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:43,983
''The ones whose lives we lit up...''

1280
00:54:51,231 --> 00:54:57,727
''have left us alone
in this world''

1281
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:11,348
''May no one ever suffer a fate
like ours''

1282
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:25,355
''We seek solace for
every troubled heart''

1283
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:31,759
''We pray for your loved ones''

1284
00:55:50,023 --> 00:55:56,553
''Give us the piece of bread
you may not have eaten''

1285
00:56:07,307 --> 00:56:14,179
''The clothes you have discarded...
give them to us''

1286
00:56:42,075 --> 00:56:48,036
''We're your own children...
we seek mercy from you''

1287
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:54,444
''We pray for your loved ones''

1288
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,845
Sir...
- What?

1289
00:57:24,183 --> 00:57:26,276
l want a job, sir.
- Get going

1290
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:29,487
l'll wash your utensils, sir...
- Go away, l say

1291
00:57:29,756 --> 00:57:33,089
He wants a job, he says,
and he was eyeing the goodies

1292
00:57:35,528 --> 00:57:37,496
May l carry it for you, sir?
- Can you?

1293
00:57:37,697 --> 00:57:40,291
Why not, sir? l sure will.
- Go ahead then

1294
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,637
Eat something before you
carry things. Go away

1295
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:55,510
l told you, you can't carry it!
... pick it up

1296
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:02,519
Manglu, have you packed everything?
You haven't locked this

1297
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:04,518
Take it downstairs. Hurry

1298
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:07,325
Renu, what are you doing my child?
Hurry up, dear

1299
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,255
The train leaves at ten

1300
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:14,523
''Yes, we're going away
for a couple of months''

1301
00:58:15,568 --> 00:58:18,093
''lt'll be a nice change for Renu...''

1302
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:22,767
''and we want Renu to forget
her past life''

1303
00:58:23,576 --> 00:58:27,342
''We want her to grown up to be a
decent, respectable and educated girl''

1304
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:35,076
My daughter's leaving today...?
Belu's leaving?

1305
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:41,220
l will go over to meet her...
l'll surely meet her

1306
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:52,465
Hey brother, why are you crying?
- Who are you?

1307
00:58:57,677 --> 00:59:01,579
God snatched my mother from me
and the Government snatched my father

1308
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:04,912
Yet someone snatched Belu from me and
someone else snatched by berries

1309
00:59:05,718 --> 00:59:08,915
What else will l do, if not cry?
- What do you do for a living?

1310
00:59:09,622 --> 00:59:13,922
l'm doing nothing at the moment.
l used to be a shoe-shine boy

1311
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:17,252
But l don't even have the money
for that now

1312
00:59:18,631 --> 00:59:20,758
Can you give me some work?
- Will you go with us?

1313
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:23,729
We beg for a living.
- And we make lots of money

1314
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:26,197
Will you join us?
- Beg...?

1315
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:30,405
No. l will not beg
- Will you starve to death, if not beg?

1316
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:34,610
Beg till you have the money to buy
the polish. Give it up later

1317
00:59:35,014 --> 00:59:36,982
No, l will not beg

1318
00:59:41,988 --> 00:59:45,355
No, l will not beg!
- Will you starve to death then?

1319
00:59:45,725 --> 00:59:49,024
Beg till you have money to buy
the polish. Give it up later

1320
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:52,631
No, l will not beg

1321
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:56,790
l'll starve to death...
but l won't ever beg!

1322
00:59:57,403 --> 01:00:00,031
l won't beg! No... never!

1323
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:21,660
l'm extremely hungry

1324
01:00:22,695 --> 01:00:26,825
John Chacha, l'm feeling uneasy...
l'm starved

1325
01:00:27,266 --> 01:00:30,463
Beg till you have money to buy
the polish. Give it up later

1326
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:31,564
No!

1327
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:46,281
''Give me a penny, sir...''

1328
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:55,785
Sir... l wasn't beg...

1329
01:01:08,074 --> 01:01:11,043
Sir... a penny sir!

1330
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:37,732
One penny, sir. Please...
- Get lost!

1331
01:01:41,607 --> 01:01:45,043
A penny, sir... l haven't
eaten in two days

1332
01:01:45,845 --> 01:01:48,746
Sir... one penny.
l'm very hungry...

1333
01:01:49,782 --> 01:01:52,148
Sir, a penny...
- Go away!

1334
01:02:05,398 --> 01:02:08,367
Bhola...? You?

1335
01:02:14,907 --> 01:02:17,205
You're begging?
Why don't you die instead?

1336
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:20,278
No... no!

1337
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:48,807
John Chacha! Bhola's going away!
Stop him!

1338
01:02:49,442 --> 01:02:51,637
Bhola, wait there...! Wait!

1339
01:02:55,715 --> 01:02:57,546
Wait, Bhola... wait!

1340
01:02:59,952 --> 01:03:02,147
Wait!

1341
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:23,842
My son! Where have you been?
Where?

1342
01:03:39,825 --> 01:03:45,229
Where had you gone away, Belu?
John Chacha, l've found Belu!

1343
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,506
''There will be a new dawn''

1344
01:03:55,408 --> 01:03:59,037
''And the Sun will
fill their lives with gold''

1345
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,048
''You will grow up to be educated,
sing and dance and be happy''

1346
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:07,680
''He looks after everyone...
everyone''

1347
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:10,647
''Never look back,
never be afraid...''

1348
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,053
''the earth and the skies
belong to you... just march ahead''

1349
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,567
''Reach for the stars''

1350
01:04:29,442 --> 01:04:34,004
''You're one in millions, my children.
Just march on''

1351
01:04:38,884 --> 01:04:42,615
''After night...''

1352
01:04:43,055 --> 01:04:45,421
''A new dawn''
