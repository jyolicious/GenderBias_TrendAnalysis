00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:55,934
"Dance Performance Of Roopkala
Student Of Dance Maestro Mangal"

2
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,182
Girdhar... come here.

3
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,749
Coming Baba.

4
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,955
Remove this poster.

5
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,426
What are you doing?

6
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:27,072
Stop it... we will
hand you over to police.

7
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,005
Hand over her to the
police for vulgar dances.

8
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:38,281
She claims to be my student
She is demeaning me.

9
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,194
She is not my student.

10
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,795
Please come in madam

11
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,140
Look old man. Don't create
a scene out here

12
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,542
Get away from here.

13
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:17,020
Shame on you Roopkala.
Demeaning me for money.

14
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,991
Look, the same poster again

15
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,147
Whose house is this?

16
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,412
Very good.
Great performance.

17
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,118
Don't praise this.
It's a cheap act, not dance

18
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,284
There is no classical touch in it.

19
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,691
You seems to be a dancer?
Yes. I am.

20
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,222
Then don't talk too much
Let's have a competition,

21
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,396
Bring the Tabala.

22
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,435
Very good... very good

23
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,515
Come on son let's
show them some more.

24
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,619
Bring the instrument.
Will you also play?

25
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,955
Yes sir... why not.

26
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,162
"It is morning and the student
has come to take Blessings

27
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,397
from his teacher".

28
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:48,015
This is called dance.
He is a true dancer.

29
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,859
Let's go son.

30
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,967
Was he Master Mangal?
The dance Maestro.

31
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,810
What! He was Master Mangal?

32
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,441
He is respected all
over the country.

33
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,443
He has won the
Bharat Natraj award

34
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,153
You must be aware of it, sir.

35
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,389
That is true, but don't
talk about that award,

36
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,226
My father had also participated
in the competition,

37
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,659
But dishonest judges
favoured Mangal.

38
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,271
But sir after watching
his son dancing,

39
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,409
I feel as if I have not
been taught properly.

40
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,447
Yes... But it was Mr. Mani
who wanted me to teach you.

41
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:51,051
. In just six months,
so that you could perform all over.

42
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,392
What else can I do in 6 months?

43
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,094
Mangal would not have taught
you even basics in 6 months.

44
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,972
I don't want to listen to
anything against Master Mangal.

45
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,674
You are humiliating me.
I won't come here again.

46
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,235
Bindiya come here

47
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:45,802
Master Mangal has just left,
go and see where is he staying?

48
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:53,482
He is living in a guest house.
Came only yesterday from Banaras.

49
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,503
Girdhar, how was Neela's dance?

50
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,073
She is a naive, Baba.

51
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:30,984
She is not an ordinary dancer son,
I could see that in her dance.

52
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,226
All the girls we have seen till
now,

53
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,158
Neela, certainly is the best.

54
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,960
We have little time
for the competition.

55
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,432
Yes. Only a year for
Nateshwer competition.

56
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,977
I agree, we will have
to work hard on Neela,

57
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,444
But hard work only
Makes future.

58
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:03,151
I request you sir,
please accept me as your student.

59
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,236
Is it just enthusiasm, or.
You are serious?

60
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,543
I am serious sir,
that is why I have come to you.

61
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,453
You will have to pay a
heavy Gurudakshina (tuition fee)

62
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,757
Why not sir...
Money, land, house, jewelry

63
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,718
I don't want your property.
I want hard work,

64
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,558
Commitment... of a true saint.

65
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,998
I am willing to give any test sir.

66
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,837
I don't have time for tests,

67
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,374
We have to participate
in the Nateshwer competition

68
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,349
There will be one solo
performance by Girdhar,

69
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:19,630
And one with a female dancer.
If it is acceptable to you.

70
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,994
Then I will accept you
as my student.

71
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,365
Baba, it is easier said than done

72
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,142
What does she knew
about the hardships of art?

73
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,243
Tell me,
what I have to do, sir?

74
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,719
You will have to face
hardships of practice,

75
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,488
There won't be time
for other things,

76
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,726
You won't be able to cry even.
There will be wounds in your feet

77
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,925
I am ready to face,
what may come.

78
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,298
The aspirations of youth,
love and romance...

79
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,402
Will be replaced by
complete devotion for art.

80
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,978
I am willing to live
like a saint sir.

81
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:21,118
May god give you the strength
. stick to your decision.

82
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:27,858
Your new life begins tomorrow,
god bless you.

83
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,764
Congratulations.
Congratulations

84
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,790
God bless you daughter.

85
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,730
Thank you,
have some sweets.

86
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,480
Sir, meet my friend Manilal.

87
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,349
A friend... and an artist also.

88
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,648
Let me know if she does anything
wrong

89
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,021
Yes... yes, why not

90
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,495
Girdhar you will teach Neela
her first lesson... come Neela.

91
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,880
Neela is inviting
trouble for herself

92
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:48,530
Not earning enough, because
she has stopped performing.

93
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,563
On top of that Master
Mangal's demands...

94
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,744
I spend 50 Rs.
For household stuff today.

95
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:13,350
Shut up. Look there, your Madam
is working hard. For art,

96
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,492
And you... Unnecessarily
making an issue.

97
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,634
Sit here, touch my feet
and take an oath... oh...

98
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:39,344
Your husband will
take care of you.

99
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,419
It's my turn now.
Take an oath and say.

100
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,120
What?

101
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,767
I Badalu, slave of
queen Bindiya.

102
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,836
You Neela's servant...

103
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,504
you are like a tomato...

104
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,575
...brinjal

105
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,069
...cucumber

106
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,946
What did you say?

107
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,807
Your wife will take
care of you.

108
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,446
Let me see,
what can you do.

109
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,887
I was joking.
Stop... stop please.

110
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,706
Hello sir...

111
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,136
Hello, hello
please be seated.

112
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,311
Manilal you will see
for yourself.

113
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,111
How well Neela is dancing now.

114
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,990
Girdhar, are you ready?
Yes let's start.

115
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:58,624
Very good. Well done,
you may go now.

116
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,470
Manilal. What do you think?

117
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,604
It was great sir.

118
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:16,640
As if Lord Krishna
and Radha were dancing.

119
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,709
That is what true art is.

120
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,112
True art or true.?

121
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,482
What do you mean Mani?

122
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,119
I see a possibility of
both of them falling...

123
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,424
...in love with each other.

124
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,630
I don't agree.

125
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:38,068
Girdhar has worked with
many beautiful girls

126
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,936
But he has never
crossed his limits.

127
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,706
Then it's fine sir...

128
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,178
You know it well,
I am in love with Neela.

129
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,547
Yes Mani... more than you
I am worried about Girdhar,

130
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,590
Believe me no one in our
family can think of marriage

131
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:04,053
Unless he wins the Natraj award.
They don't care about love etc.

132
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:10,128
For us carrying forward the
traditions of family is supreme.

133
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:24,647
I cant understand what you
are saying, but it's fine.

134
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,450
Good bye Manilal.

135
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,531
Very good Neela...
you performed very well

136
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:50,229
I know involvement of a
dancer is very important,

137
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:54,635
But not to the extent
of destroying one's life.

138
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,807
What are you talking about?

139
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,181
I want you to rise in
life Neela.

140
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,992
This is what I expect from you.

141
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,924
If you need some money.

142
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,787
Please send
Badalu to collect it.

143
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,794
I can do anything for you,

144
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,534
but don't get involved with Girdhar

145
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,014
Did you hear anything?

146
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,441
What?

147
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,843
Madam has decided not
to get married.

148
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,381
It's a good decision.

149
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,891
Then why did you got married?

150
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:48,188
My story is different.
It was a gamble for me.

151
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,096
What...?
It's a different matter that

152
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,199
both of us have won this gamble.

153
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:07,917
You got a nice husband, and I
got a wife, one in millions.

154
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,027
Leave me... you naughty.

155
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,840
Why did you stop?
Where did you learn it from?

156
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,875
I worked as a driver for a
British officer,

157
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,379
I learnt it there.

158
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,018
I have taught Bindiya
a little bit of it,

159
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,724
but it's not a good dance.

160
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,255
Why?

161
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,528
No Madam you won't
be able to do it.

162
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,465
Why, I would like to see
and dance... you start.

163
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,784
This is very easy...

164
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,455
...come join us

165
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,536
Neela...

166
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,507
Mani are you drunk?

167
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:22,639
Sir that dance is such, that you
feel as if you are drunk,

168
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,910
Certainly you are a
great teacher,

169
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,879
you taught them Western dance too.

170
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:36,555
Western dance...?
Never. It's a sin.

171
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,155
May be, but it's great.

172
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,618
Girdhar, you have come
down to this stage?

173
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,760
What a cheap dance?
What is wrong with you?

174
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,506
Ooh. My leg...

175
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:31,375
What are you staring
at... help him.

176
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,651
You are a bad man.

177
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,395
Try to understand, Neela.

178
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,267
Get this ointment ready,
don't make it too hot

179
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,342
OK I will also come with you.

180
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,355
Forgive me Girdhar it's
all because of me.

181
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,035
Don't be silly.

182
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,804
I know Girdhar It's
difficult. Alas!

183
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:43,015
I could have shared
it with you.

184
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:47,585
Your words are enough.
Now there is no pain.

185
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:28,423
I know it's painful son.
My heart is also crying.

186
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:35,398
Whenever I beat you I
start cursing myself,

187
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:45,573
I should have not done it
but what do I do,

188
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:11,564
I want you to win
thenNatraj award.

189
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:27,187
Why are you crying,
he will be fine.

190
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:53,774
Bindiya... food is ready? What's
the matter Badalu?

191
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:59,253
Need some money Madam,
can I ask Mr. Mani?

192
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,855
NO... no. No question of taking
money from him henceforth.

193
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,239
You work so hard Madam,
you must take some rest

194
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,882
This is what gives
me satisfaction.

195
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,071
What are you trying to do?

196
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,510
I was trying to walk... see.

197
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,847
What are you doing... Don't move.

198
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,885
Why not? I can walk.

199
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,190
Take care. Don't get impatient.

200
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,506
Sing a song Neela.

201
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,490
For the Mahashivratari Festival...

202
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,997
I am going to Benaras,
today itself

203
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:49,109
What about me, Baba?
I will also come along

204
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:55,646
You should take rest son,
I will be back soon

205
00:50:56,086 --> 00:51:00,045
I will also get the
dance costumes for you.

206
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:04,451
Neela. Continue your rehearsals.

207
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,570
Put these things in Tonga,

208
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,571
...take this also.

209
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:37,391
God bless you,
take care of yourself.

210
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,232
Neela.

211
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,233
How did you make out.
It's me?

212
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:22,733
My heart said so.

213
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,006
It's in the wind,
I can listen to it.

214
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,777
It seems no rehearsal today.

215
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,844
Who said so...?

216
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:38,344
It's in the wind,
I can listen to it.

217
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,921
It's not like that.
But if you want then.

218
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:46,228
There won't be any.

219
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:48,825
But why...?

220
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,468
Where are your eyes?

221
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,397
Here

222
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,140
What is that?

223
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,234
My feet.

224
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,102
And below them?

225
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,573
Earth.

226
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,712
And above the earth...?

227
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,642
Both of us.

228
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,186
I am asking you what is that?

229
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:18,359
Oh. This... colors,
But who has done this?

230
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,963
Me... It was a new dance map.

231
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,614
You should have told me earlier

232
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,714
Anyway, get away from here now.

233
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,517
Not that side... this way.

234
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:04,032
I worked so hard on it,
you have spoiled it all

235
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,749
I am sorry.

236
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,919
What sorry.?
Get away from here.

237
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,740
No rehearsal today Madam?

238
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,780
No... I am not feeling well

239
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:20,813
I am feeling very sad today.
What should I do?

240
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:35,430
Go to sleep or take
a stroll, simple.

241
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:44,302
This is not possible I
can't leave her alone.

242
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,415
Oh... I only came to
pluck some mangos.

243
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,847
Mangos are there.

244
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,717
How is she now?

245
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:10,255
Fine... she is going for a walk.

246
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,560
For a walk? Alone?

247
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,473
She is going with me.

248
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:22,767
With you...? Badalu we
will also go for a walk.

249
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,140
Towards the river... Sir?

250
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,075
No... yes to the river side.

251
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:25,300
Badalu, ask them to go
somewhere else.

252
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:39,851
Don't disturb us.
Go somewhere else.

253
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:50,390
Tell them we are not
going to leave this place.

254
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:06,042
We won't leave this place.
We will dance here.

255
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,225
We will also dance.

256
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:34,070
We are not going,
we will also dance.

257
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,621
Tell them not to tease
us like that.

258
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:10,470
Don't tease us otherwise
Madam will get angry.

259
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:18,751
Madam never said so,
it's your own interpretation.

260
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,257
Don't make me angry.

261
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:33,062
Keep your maid in control,
she is very short- tempered.

262
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,466
You also keep this bear in control.

263
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:19,103
Tell her, that I am waiting

264
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:33,013
I am not waiting for you,
I am waiting for Neela.

265
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,721
She is not at home.
Gone for a walk.

266
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,253
For a walk. Alone!

267
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:40,887
Not alone, with Girdhar

268
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:45,996
I don't care with whom! But
Whenever I come she is not at home.

269
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,647
Hello sir.

270
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,243
Hello, don't touch it.

271
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,022
How was your journey?

272
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:12,360
It was fine! I was more
worried about Neela"s rehearsal,

273
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,163
Hope everything was ok.

274
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:20,233
Yes. Yes, they are
out on a walk.

275
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,131
This is no time for walk...

276
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,300
Time is just fine sir.

277
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,372
What do you mean?

278
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:33,306
Very simple! Evening time
is best for romance.

279
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,844
Look Mani,

280
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:41,246
don't try to instigate me
against Neela and Girdhar.

281
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,723
I have full faith in Girdhar.

282
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,888
I too, but don't forget,
they are young.

283
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,299
Anyway. Goodbye.

284
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,348
Hello Baba.

285
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:13,244
God bless you,
what about rehearsal?

286
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,984
Neela is not well.
So we went out for a walk.

287
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:22,389
No rehearsal in my absence?

288
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,727
She did it, Baba.

289
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,002
For which dance?
Tandava of Lord Shiva...?

290
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,029
No Baba...

291
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:36,104
Oh...! Then Mani was right.

292
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:51,283
Do you know, why I have
been to Benaras?

293
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,695
For the festival and costumes.

294
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:09,101
Look, here are these costumes.
This is our tradition,

295
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:15,750
To carry forward it,
should be your objective

296
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,722
This objective will
never be completed,

297
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:28,925
if you waste your time
with Neela like this.

298
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,066
I am sorry.

299
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,846
I know... she is
responsible for this.

300
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:52,686
Don't ever repeat it. Otherwise
we will leave this place.

301
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,624
What is the matter Neela?

302
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,498
White dress and looking sad.?

303
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:47,238
Today we will practice,
the dance of "separation".

304
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:50,946
It will suit you also.

305
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:04,182
"Girl is waiting for her beloved
but he did not come".

306
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:18,603
Tell me Girdhar,
Baba is angry with me?

307
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:21,000
No

308
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:33,811
"Then she got hopeless. And started
throwing away her ornaments".

309
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,985
Don't hide from me,

310
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:46,427
is it true that you are
going to leave this house?

311
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:57,541
Don't be silly...
you don't know the truth.

312
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,373
Then tell me the truth.

313
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:08,319
Sir is only saying, we
should not waste our time

314
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:12,152
otherwise, he will leave this house.

315
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:28,301
Don't get angry.
Look at me, don't cry.

316
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:04,336
Do you have some time?
. I want to talk to you.

317
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:29,567
Having nice time with Girdhar
these days? And why not?

318
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,564
After all both of you
are living together.

319
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:41,310
Now onwards both of them,
are going to stay with me.

320
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,913
Why. What is your problem...?

321
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,383
I can't tolerate your
love for Girdhar,

322
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,252
He will only come
here for rehearsals.

323
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:03,271
I won't allow you to do so.

324
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,042
This is what I want.!

325
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,909
I have always taken care of you,

326
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,448
I don't want to hurt my feelings.

327
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,216
But I never accepted your love.

328
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:29,557
Maybe! But I helped you a lot.

329
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:38,668
I thought you are a gentleman.
But now, I know what you are.

330
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:42,371
I am not a coward.

331
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,078
You have proved it,
and listen.

332
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:58,587
Girdhar and Baba will stay here
if you don't like it. Then.

333
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:03,889
Then I should not come here
that is all you want to say.

334
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:08,600
But I can't forget you Neela.

335
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,631
Don't touch me...

336
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:26,217
Go, your god is waiting for you,
but remember only I can help you.

337
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,021
Your intimate conversation
is over?

338
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,965
Oh... you are jealous.

339
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:19,497
...but why do you care?
You are going to leave my house

340
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,504
Don't talk rubbish...
it hurts me.

341
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:31,218
Oh. What a surprise!
You also have a heart.?

342
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:35,280
If you talk like this.
I will leave this house.

343
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,351
The way Lord Shiva left Parvati?
And then,

344
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:44,855
Parvati searched for Shiva,
dressed up like a tribal woman.

345
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:38,422
I too found you.

346
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:53,980
Neela...

347
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:27,539
Baba...

348
01:22:05,714 --> 01:22:07,443
Drink the milk...

349
01:22:18,293 --> 01:22:20,158
...and go to sleep.

350
01:22:56,865 --> 01:23:00,494
Baba will there be
rehearsal tomorrow?

351
01:23:02,437 --> 01:23:05,235
Yes! But for a different dance.

352
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:47,380
"Saint Vishwamitra prayed for
thousands of years

353
01:23:48,383 --> 01:23:51,978
And cast his
indelible imprint on the world.

354
01:24:10,772 --> 01:24:13,263
By
virtue of his prayers power.

355
01:24:13,809 --> 01:24:17,142
Vishwamitra created a
world of his own.

356
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:24,614
He challenged Lord Indra,

357
01:24:26,054 --> 01:24:30,184
Out of fear Lord Indra sent
the most beautiful and clever

358
01:24:30,725 --> 01:24:34,593
Fairy of the heaven... Menaka".

359
01:24:36,364 --> 01:24:38,696
Neela are you ready?

360
01:28:35,837 --> 01:28:40,740
Neela. You have spoiled 20 years
hard work of Girdhar.

361
01:28:47,549 --> 01:28:49,847
Why would I do that...?

362
01:28:50,518 --> 01:28:52,076
For yourself...

363
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:59,326
Is it not true
that you have entangled

364
01:28:59,728 --> 01:29:01,719
Girdhar in your love?

365
01:29:06,234 --> 01:29:10,170
Not at all sir.
I swear my love is sacred.

366
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:15,673
Swearing again!
You don't feel ashamed...?

367
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:22,074
Don't forget, your promise,
that you will be committed to dance

368
01:29:23,518 --> 01:29:29,354
Only. And will not involved
in absurd things like... Love.

369
01:29:31,326 --> 01:29:35,422
Let's go Girdhar we won't stay
here even for a minute.

370
01:29:46,508 --> 01:29:48,601
No Baba, I love Neela.

371
01:29:50,011 --> 01:29:53,037
What! You are in love
with Neela?

372
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:56,447
Then what about dance...?

373
01:29:57,185 --> 01:30:00,814
I can't live without Neela.

374
01:30:09,197 --> 01:30:12,530
You fool... get out from here.

375
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:19,467
He is in love with Neela,

376
01:30:33,955 --> 01:30:38,119
What should not have happened,
has happened.

377
01:30:41,095 --> 01:30:43,461
I have lost the battle.

378
01:30:43,832 --> 01:30:45,891
Don't say like this sir.

379
01:30:46,968 --> 01:30:49,334
First I lost his mother,

380
01:30:51,372 --> 01:30:54,705
now you have snatched
Girdhar from me

381
01:30:56,344 --> 01:30:58,403
Why did you do that.?

382
01:31:08,389 --> 01:31:14,157
If you say. I will
stop meeting him.

383
01:31:15,563 --> 01:31:17,554
That won't help.

384
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:29,209
I will go away from here.

385
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,512
He will become a wanderer,
and search you

386
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,855
In every corner of the world.

387
01:31:43,391 --> 01:31:46,258
I am ready to give up my life.

388
01:31:47,629 --> 01:31:50,564
So you want to burden
me with a sin...?

389
01:31:51,432 --> 01:31:53,992
Then... what do I do sir?

390
01:31:59,908 --> 01:32:05,073
Now you cant do anything,
I myself have to do something.

391
01:32:06,381 --> 01:32:08,178
What is that?

392
01:32:09,918 --> 01:32:13,012
I will go somewhere.

393
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:22,252
But sir... what about your dreams?
Your expectations?

394
01:32:23,431 --> 01:32:27,026
Your dancing bells have
destroyed my dreams,

395
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:33,300
now with the ashes
of my dreams,

396
01:32:34,575 --> 01:32:38,739
I will go and sit on
Girdhar's mothers memorial.

397
01:32:53,995 --> 01:32:57,431
Oh my god... What should I do?

398
01:37:46,854 --> 01:37:48,651
Neela...

399
01:37:51,225 --> 01:37:56,288
Neela where are you going...?
Come... I will drop you.

400
01:38:07,775 --> 01:38:10,608
No... Wait Mani, I am coming.

401
01:38:14,615 --> 01:38:16,480
Going with him again?

402
01:38:16,884 --> 01:38:19,284
Yes! After all he is
a old friend.

403
01:38:19,687 --> 01:38:24,351
Then. Why this... hypocrisy?
You have betrayed me.

404
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:33,530
You may say so.

405
01:38:37,805 --> 01:38:39,898
Shameless women!

406
01:39:06,233 --> 01:39:08,292
Baba...
I will also come.

407
01:39:08,669 --> 01:39:11,729
You were right,
she has betrayed me.

408
01:39:17,244 --> 01:39:19,474
Forgive your son Baba.

409
01:39:32,093 --> 01:39:33,993
Cool down son.

410
01:39:39,934 --> 01:39:41,925
I will get my luggage,

411
01:39:55,983 --> 01:39:58,850
Don't worry about the competition,

412
01:39:59,253 --> 01:40:01,653
we will find someone else.

413
01:40:05,526 --> 01:40:08,222
Thank god! We got rid of them.

414
01:40:09,363 --> 01:40:11,524
But what will happen to Madam.?

415
01:40:11,899 --> 01:40:13,730
She will marry... Manilal.

416
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:17,127
You don't know the matters of
heart,

417
01:40:18,005 --> 01:40:19,973
Because you don't have one.

418
01:40:20,374 --> 01:40:23,366
My heart... You will see
that I was right.

419
01:40:30,951 --> 01:40:33,249
Let me call Madam.

420
01:40:40,261 --> 01:40:43,458
Stop it here.
I want to get down.

421
01:40:44,131 --> 01:40:45,428
What is this?

422
01:40:48,469 --> 01:40:50,937
I was only fooling Girdhar.

423
01:40:51,672 --> 01:40:55,199
First you make a fool of him,
now me. What is this nonsense?

424
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:57,100
You are ditching me.

425
01:40:57,478 --> 01:41:01,778
Yes. I have ditched you all.
I am ditching to my own self.

426
01:41:04,051 --> 01:41:05,951
You go away

427
01:41:09,523 --> 01:41:12,014
...otherwise I will
jump into the river.

428
01:41:15,529 --> 01:41:17,429
Go to hell

429
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:23,660
You betrayer!

430
01:41:27,908 --> 01:41:33,574
No I am not, my love is sacred,
Spotless... I am not a betrayer.

431
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:42,213
Let the world say. Whatever
it wants to say

432
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:46,686
But you cannot say so.
I am not a hypocrite.

433
01:41:50,164 --> 01:41:52,632
You betrayer! Hypocrite!

434
01:42:08,215 --> 01:42:11,116
No I am not.

435
01:42:17,091 --> 01:42:19,286
For god sake, keep quiet.

436
01:42:55,362 --> 01:42:58,422
You are very lucky,
god saved you.

437
01:43:00,334 --> 01:43:02,598
Why did you save me god?

438
01:43:03,737 --> 01:43:07,195
You should have called
me to your abode.

439
01:43:09,109 --> 01:43:11,634
Don't say such things. Good lady.

440
01:43:12,012 --> 01:43:14,105
Don't call me good lady.

441
01:43:14,782 --> 01:43:17,216
I have given pain to people.

442
01:43:17,585 --> 01:43:21,043
I don't deserved mercy,
I am a sinner.

443
01:43:35,636 --> 01:43:39,663
Please come. Have a seat,
let me call her.

444
01:43:50,618 --> 01:43:52,313
Oh. It's you?

445
01:43:53,187 --> 01:43:55,849
Yes sir your old student,
Roopkala.

446
01:44:00,327 --> 01:44:02,955
What are you doing.
Touch his feet.

447
01:44:03,931 --> 01:44:05,364
Forgive me sir.

448
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:08,498
Cant forgive you...

449
01:44:09,069 --> 01:44:11,902
you had destroyed
my hard work, for money

450
01:44:12,272 --> 01:44:15,708
I have no place for you.

451
01:44:17,344 --> 01:44:23,476
Have mercy on us, give her
one more chance, please sir.

452
01:44:25,185 --> 01:44:30,384
Sir, you hardly have time
to groom someone else,

453
01:44:32,226 --> 01:44:34,922
You have worked a lot upon her.

454
01:44:41,635 --> 01:44:43,296
Ok, as you wish.

455
01:44:52,946 --> 01:44:54,345
Madam...

456
01:45:02,389 --> 01:45:04,323
What are you doing here.?

457
01:45:04,692 --> 01:45:07,286
I was searching for you Madam.

458
01:45:09,063 --> 01:45:10,758
I am tired.

459
01:45:11,298 --> 01:45:15,200
You will be tired, if you
continue wandering like this.

460
01:45:15,769 --> 01:45:19,933
It's not wandering around.
It's sacrifice.

461
01:45:25,145 --> 01:45:27,511
Don't spoil your life...

462
01:45:28,682 --> 01:45:31,480
I may have spoiled my life but,

463
01:45:32,419 --> 01:45:35,217
I have found my heart
in his memory.

464
01:45:40,027 --> 01:45:44,862
Till he wins Nateshwar award,
I shall remain like this.

465
01:45:45,966 --> 01:45:48,526
But for that, you have
to survive.

466
01:45:57,578 --> 01:46:00,411
Don't worry about me.

467
01:46:34,648 --> 01:46:37,776
I have come here to take
another chance,

468
01:46:41,455 --> 01:46:45,323
You still have time.
Don't waste your life.

469
01:46:48,729 --> 01:46:52,631
I am not wasting my life.
My love is sacred.

470
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,696
It cannot be a one sided affair.

471
01:47:03,143 --> 01:47:06,510
I don't care, he must
win the award,

472
01:47:09,316 --> 01:47:12,774
That is all what I want.

473
01:47:16,323 --> 01:47:19,520
(remember only after winning the
award,

474
01:47:20,027 --> 01:47:23,292
he will think about marriage)

475
01:47:24,498 --> 01:47:27,831
Are you sure, that he will win?

476
01:47:31,905 --> 01:47:35,534
I have full faith in his
talent and my prayers.

477
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:40,278
I am willing to sacrifice
my life for him.

478
01:47:46,053 --> 01:47:49,079
If you do that, what will
happen to me?

479
01:47:52,226 --> 01:47:56,492
I will see to it,
that he should not win.

480
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,525
Where are you...
Have you gone mad?

481
01:48:54,488 --> 01:48:56,683
I don't feel like dancing.

482
01:48:58,892 --> 01:49:02,851
What are you saying...? Get up.

483
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,317
Neela...

484
01:54:34,494 --> 01:54:36,689
Are you talking to me?

485
01:54:37,330 --> 01:54:38,763
Yes.

486
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:44,327
But I am not Neela,
I am a devotee of Lord Krishna.

487
01:54:47,741 --> 01:54:50,642
I can't forget you. Neela.

488
01:54:55,148 --> 01:54:57,810
You need peace,
this restlessness...

489
01:54:58,184 --> 01:55:00,675
Will not give you anything.

490
01:55:05,091 --> 01:55:08,891
You are my life Neela,
let's go somewhere else,

491
01:55:09,462 --> 01:55:11,794
Far from here...

492
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:17,468
...to fulfill our dreams.

493
01:55:26,713 --> 01:55:28,943
Come to your senses.

494
01:55:32,952 --> 01:55:35,614
Concentrate on your dance.

495
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:49,163
These preachings don't suit you,
You are playing another game

496
01:55:53,173 --> 01:55:57,872
to make fool of someone else.
I will kill you.

497
01:56:05,852 --> 01:56:09,185
Stop it Girdhar... you fool,
if you kill her,

498
01:56:10,523 --> 01:56:12,718
You will be hanged.

499
01:56:16,996 --> 01:56:20,261
May what come... I will
finish her right now.

500
01:56:22,001 --> 01:56:24,799
Stop it... cool down.

501
01:56:26,306 --> 01:56:29,605
Today you are saved, but,
if I see you again,

502
01:56:30,243 --> 01:56:32,108
I shall finish you.

503
01:56:33,847 --> 01:56:39,717
Why are you adamant to
destroy him.? Get lost.

504
01:56:50,263 --> 01:56:54,563
I am going away, you will
not see me again,

505
01:56:55,735 --> 01:57:01,401
Even the news of my death
will not reach you.

506
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:03,534
Madam has disappeared again.

507
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:07,662
Again... where she
would have gone?

508
01:58:21,221 --> 01:58:24,247
I am looking for her
since last 4 days.

509
01:58:24,624 --> 01:58:28,060
Let's not waste any time...
Let's go and search her.

510
01:58:53,987 --> 01:58:57,514
We are lucky Badalu, perhaps
we can use his car.

511
01:58:57,991 --> 01:58:59,253
But how?

512
01:58:59,626 --> 01:59:01,685
Just see.

513
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:04,458
What is the matter?

514
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:09,368
Madam has disappeared again,
I ask him everyday to search,

515
01:59:19,345 --> 01:59:21,438
And I call her every day,

516
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,317
come on.

517
01:59:38,698 --> 01:59:40,996
Is there enough fuel in it?

518
01:59:41,634 --> 01:59:43,033
Yes...

519
01:59:46,005 --> 01:59:49,372
Don't worry you will
find your car somewhere.

520
01:59:49,842 --> 01:59:52,640
Wait... wait... where
are you going?

521
02:00:56,476 --> 02:00:58,137
Stop... please stop.

522
02:00:59,312 --> 02:01:01,837
What is the matter?

523
02:01:02,348 --> 02:01:04,282
There lying a woman,
unconscious,

524
02:01:04,651 --> 02:01:06,551
Please take her to the city.

525
02:01:06,919 --> 02:01:10,184
No thank you sir...
one woman is enough for me.

526
02:01:17,597 --> 02:01:18,347
I say stop! Oh...

527
02:01:25,938 --> 02:01:27,929
Madam. Madam

528
02:01:31,044 --> 02:01:32,602
She is your Madam?

529
02:01:39,719 --> 02:01:41,846
I am Bindiya, let's go home.

530
02:01:44,190 --> 02:01:46,886
You are looking very ill Madam.

531
02:01:48,795 --> 02:01:52,322
Yes...! I know I won't survive
. but before I die.

532
02:01:57,170 --> 02:01:59,695
I want to meet him for once.

533
02:02:07,914 --> 02:02:11,111
They say everybody
dies empty handed

534
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:17,986
Weather my desires shall
also remain unfulfilled?

535
02:02:21,427 --> 02:02:23,395
Don't let this happen.

536
02:02:26,733 --> 02:02:28,724
Where do you want to go Madam?

537
02:02:29,102 --> 02:02:31,036
Nateshwer temple.

538
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:29,929
Attention! All and sundry,
The chief is coming.

539
02:04:06,332 --> 02:04:10,428
Ladies and gentleman since
last many days,

540
02:04:12,104 --> 02:04:16,040
Nateshwar competition is in
progress,

541
02:04:18,511 --> 02:04:21,036
Those who have participated,

542
02:04:22,081 --> 02:04:26,142
have been defeated
By Master Mangal's son Girdhar.

543
02:04:26,519 --> 02:04:30,353
There is no one to compete
with him now, therefore...

544
02:04:31,357 --> 02:04:32,756
Stop...

545
02:04:42,134 --> 02:04:44,261
Competition is not yet over,

546
02:04:44,837 --> 02:04:47,806
There is another artist
to compete with Girdhar

547
02:04:48,207 --> 02:04:50,437
Mr. Ramprasad from Agara.

548
02:04:50,977 --> 02:04:55,641
Good... now we will see
the battle between these two.

549
02:04:56,616 --> 02:05:01,110
One who wins, will be the
claimant for the duet dance.

550
02:05:02,255 --> 02:05:07,215
And will have the opportunity
to win Natraj award.

551
02:05:13,799 --> 02:05:15,460
Please start.

552
02:05:18,237 --> 02:05:20,933
Girdhar my son, go ahead...

553
02:05:24,577 --> 02:05:27,774
If you defeat him, I will
give you Rs. 5,000.

554
02:05:30,283 --> 02:05:32,547
Not 5,000, I want 10,000.

555
02:05:55,308 --> 02:05:56,605
You start first.

556
02:05:56,976 --> 02:05:58,409
Very good...

557
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:19,163
great...

558
02:06:40,052 --> 02:06:41,679
Well done...

559
02:07:02,041 --> 02:07:03,770
Strange!

560
02:07:04,543 --> 02:07:06,306
What happened?

561
02:07:07,246 --> 02:07:12,149
Medicines are not effective, but,
With the sound of dancing bells

562
02:07:12,718 --> 02:07:15,050
she is becoming conscious.

563
02:08:54,854 --> 02:08:57,789
Very good... Great performance.

564
02:09:04,697 --> 02:09:08,360
Friends today is the last
day of the competition,

565
02:09:09,168 --> 02:09:14,970
Now Girdhar will perform
Tandav dance with Roopkala.

566
02:09:21,147 --> 02:09:26,175
After this there will be Pooja
dance, and in the end,

567
02:09:30,656 --> 02:09:33,090
The award will be given.

568
02:09:37,496 --> 02:09:39,555
I cant betray him...

569
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:49,602
Then betray yourself. I am giving
you Rs. 15,000... think again.

570
02:09:52,678 --> 02:09:56,114
You won't be able to earn
this much of money,

571
02:09:57,449 --> 02:09:59,815
Throughout your life.

572
02:10:07,226 --> 02:10:12,323
"Centuries ago when the world
was dominated by torture and sin.

573
02:10:14,533 --> 02:10:17,468
Then Lord Shiva got angry.

574
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:21,771
He started Tandava to
destroy the world,

575
02:10:22,474 --> 02:10:26,672
Gods and human being, both went
to Goddess Parvati,

576
02:10:31,550 --> 02:10:33,916
Without caring for her life

577
02:10:35,287 --> 02:10:41,192
Parvati went to Lord Shiva
and pacified him".

578
02:10:42,695 --> 02:10:46,290
This is the story behind
Tandava dance.

579
02:10:46,765 --> 02:10:49,666
Now you will see Girdhar and
Roopkala,

580
02:10:50,069 --> 02:10:52,094
as Shiva and Parvati.

581
02:11:21,066 --> 02:11:23,534
What are you doing Roop.

582
02:11:25,838 --> 02:11:28,773
Come to your senses.

583
02:11:31,877 --> 02:11:35,540
I have not come here...
to listen to your abuses,

584
02:11:42,621 --> 02:11:44,145
I am going.

585
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:55,933
Forgive us. Because of ill health
Roop is unable to perform

586
02:11:57,036 --> 02:12:01,029
Girdhar will play Shiva and Parvati
. simultaneously.

587
02:12:02,174 --> 02:12:04,699
But this is not possible.

588
02:12:06,145 --> 02:12:10,343
Sir I request to give
Ramprasd one more chance,

589
02:12:11,684 --> 02:12:14,152
He is ready with his partner.

590
02:12:23,462 --> 02:12:26,898
Friends since Girdhar is unable
to perform.

591
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:31,968
The opportunity is given to
Ramprasad.

592
02:12:39,011 --> 02:12:41,309
Girdhar... Vacate the stage.

593
02:12:41,714 --> 02:12:43,579
He will not go...

594
02:13:40,706 --> 02:13:43,334
I will dance with him

595
02:13:50,416 --> 02:13:52,475
you?

596
02:13:58,290 --> 02:13:59,757
Baba?

597
02:14:00,492 --> 02:14:03,586
You don't worry about me.
Start the dance.

598
02:15:33,352 --> 02:15:37,812
"Tandav dance created
havoc on the earth.

599
02:16:08,086 --> 02:16:10,577
The earth was crumbling".

600
02:16:47,159 --> 02:16:49,525
What are you doing Girdhar?

601
02:16:51,229 --> 02:16:52,753
Go away.

602
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:57,792
"Then Parvati requested Lord
Shiva"

603
02:17:16,555 --> 02:17:19,046
Whatever I did was for
you only,

604
02:17:20,192 --> 02:17:22,854
I want you to win this award,

605
02:17:23,729 --> 02:17:25,594
Trust me Girdhar.

606
02:17:33,438 --> 02:17:35,531
"Finally Shiva cooled down

607
02:17:36,074 --> 02:17:39,100
and handed over the trident to
Parvati".

608
02:21:16,328 --> 02:21:20,628
We have witnessed a
great performance,

609
02:21:28,073 --> 02:21:32,100
The Nateshwar award is
given to Girdhar.

610
02:21:44,923 --> 02:21:48,051
Where are you going Neela?

611
02:21:50,262 --> 02:21:52,924
My mission is over.

612
02:21:54,966 --> 02:21:58,834
You have helped Girdhar
winning the award,

613
02:21:59,971 --> 02:22:03,498
You have fulfilled your
duty of a true student,

614
02:22:04,376 --> 02:22:08,836
Lord Nateshwar is also happy,
but where is my Dakshina (fee)

615
02:22:09,981 --> 02:22:12,472
I will do whatever you say.

616
02:22:23,662 --> 02:22:32,092
Now onwards you will serve the
cause of art as man and wife.
