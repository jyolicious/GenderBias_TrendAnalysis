1
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,890
Elijah.

2
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:16,729
Elijah.

3
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,889
Elijah. Elijah.

4
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,204
I am sorry, sir.
What is wrong with your arm?

5
00:03:23,284 --> 00:03:25,849
The cruel Romans..
- The Romans..

6
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:28,280
For how long will our
God remain a mute witness?

7
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,129
Our God must have become old.

8
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,490
Yes. Sometimes,
even I doubt the same.

9
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,409
Doubt?

10
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,900
Emmanuel.

11
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:40,529
Elijah.

12
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,569
Beware.

13
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,209
Where will you escape?

14
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:07,249
Let me go.
- I won't.

15
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,900
Yes, I am an ape.

16
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,900
Emmanuel, you are an ape.
- Sure, I am.

17
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,409
Let me go. Let me go.

18
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,600
Let me go.

19
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,329
Yes, father.

20
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:36,369
That is bad.

21
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,329
You are a big boy now.
Big boys don't play on the streets.

22
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,649
Even you never did?
- Never.

23
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,890
When I was your age,
I never played on the streets.

24
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,890
All right, father.
Then, even I shall not play.

25
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,890
Bravo. My son is such a good boy.

26
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,529
Right, Emmanuel?
- Yes, Master.

27
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,769
Father, don't talk to Emmanuel.

28
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:56,169
Why?

29
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,161
I will not, son. Never.

30
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:04,681
Look, I will be going to
meet an Egyptian merchant.

31
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,410
I will be back soon, son.

32
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,310
I won't drink that.

33
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:28,521
Elijah. Oh God.
What kind of a bad omen is this.

34
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,560
Everybody, beware.

35
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,921
The governor, the great Brutus,
is on his way.

36
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:17,721
God knows better who is mad.

37
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:35,201
Who threw the stone?
Where did it come from?

38
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:38,481
From there. That boy over there.
- Arrest him. Get him.

39
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,721
That boy threw the stone.
Arrest the little one of a snake.

40
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:01,481
Emmanuel.

41
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,761
Open the door or we
will break open it.

42
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,641
Open the door.
- Open the door.

43
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:09,410
Open the door. - Open the
door or we will break open it.

44
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:10,721
We will break open it.

45
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:12,761
Open the door.

46
00:07:20,281 --> 00:07:21,361
Let go of him.

47
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,881
Emmanuel.
- Let go of him. Let go of my child.

48
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:28,410
Let go of me. Emmanuel.
- Let go of my child. Look..

49
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:30,800
Help.
- Where are you taking him?

50
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,761
Where are you taking the child?

51
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,121
Move away.

52
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:34,361
He is innocent.

53
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:38,410
Emmanuel.

54
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:41,201
Father. Father. Father.

55
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:43,529
The criminal is here, My Lord.
- Let go of me.

56
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:49,401
Elijah. Elijah.

57
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,641
This child is not guilty.
He is not guilty.

58
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,201
I know who is guilty.

59
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:57,100
Mercy, My Lord. It was me who
had flung the stone. So punish me.

60
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:06,810
Punishing one for the crime of
another is against Roman justice.

61
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,210
Take him away.
Throw him to the lions.

62
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,321
No, My Lord. Mercy, My Lord. Mercy.

63
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,100
My Lord. Have mercy on my child.
- Emmanuel.

64
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,801
Father.
- You can't take him. - Emmanuel.

65
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,241
Elijah. Elijah. Elijah.

66
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,280
Elijah. Elijah.

67
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,841
What is the matter, brothers?
What is it? Why are all of you so anxious?

68
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:03,281
Emmanuel. Emmanuel,
why are you crying?

69
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:07,561
Tell me. Tell me.
For God's sake, answer me.

70
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,921
My Elijah is not harmed, is he?

71
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:17,321
The cruel Brutus has ordered
Elijah to be thrown to the lions.

72
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,560
Save him, Master.

73
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,810
No. No. This can never be.

74
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,401
Elijah. Elijah.

75
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,660
Father. Father.

76
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,780
Come to me, my darling.

77
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,380
Father, where were you for so long?
I am very angry with you.

78
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,540
Angry? Don't be, my dear.

79
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,180
You are the light of my eyes,
my peace of mind.

80
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,420
If you get angry with me,
then how am I going to live?

81
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,939
So, my darling is angry with me?
Go on, hit me.

82
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,859
Come on, hit me like this.
Like this. Like this.

83
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,740
Mercy!

84
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,540
Mercy! Mercy!

85
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,500
Have mercy.

86
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,420
Mercy, My Lord.

87
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,699
Move away, you wretch.

88
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:14,380
Do not be afraid, dear. I have broken
his fangs. He cannot bite now.

89
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,820
Have mercy, My Lord. Have mercy.

90
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,580
Do not let the blood of a
lowly Jew taint your hands.

91
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Your virtues will be tarnished.

92
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,380
Unyielding as time, and firm as
steel, stands the law of Romans.

93
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,700
Go away.

94
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,420
Forget not that there exists a
law taller than that of Romans.

95
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,580
That of God above.

96
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,500
Let not the hands of
nature's justice..

97
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,935
..reach out to your daughter
to avenge your heinous crime.

98
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,380
No. No. No. Have mercy,
My Lord. Have mercy.

99
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,940
May God protect your
daughter until eternity.

100
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,420
May God never make you
grieve for your child.

101
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,980
May the light of your
eyes never be extinguished.

102
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:11,699
My innocent one, have the
misdeed of a slave's son pardoned.

103
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,580
I implore at your tiny feet.

104
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:20,939
With your dainty hands,
set free an innocent dove.

105
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,180
And all his life, he
will pray for you.

106
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,780
Father, why is he crying? Pardon him.

107
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,939
No, Lydia. He is a Jew.

108
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,579
So what? Pardon him.

109
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,780
No. Don't ever do that, my dear.

110
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,140
Go away, you shrewd Jew.
I forgive you.

111
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,380
Glory be to you.
Glory be to you, angel of mercy.

112
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,420
Elijah. Elijah. You are free.

113
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,260
You are free.

114
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,820
Elijah. Elijah.

115
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,540
Leave him. Leave my son.
He has been pardoned.

116
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,660
Pardoned?

117
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,900
Yes. The merciful Brutus
has taken back his judgment.

118
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,140
But what is the proof?
- The proof?

119
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:20,620
Ask him.

120
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,180
Foolish Jew. Roman
justice is irrevocable.

121
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,579
No. No.
- Father.

122
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,100
Elijah.
- Father.

123
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,260
Elijah. Elijah.

124
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:58,940
Master. It is all my fault.

125
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,260
My hands are tainted with
innocent Elijah's blood.

126
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,140
Kill me.

127
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:24,100
Why don't you listen?
Master, why don't you listen?

128
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,500
Why don't you listen?

129
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,620
Revenge.

130
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,780
Revenge against the tyrant.

131
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,860
Father!

132
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,620
Where is Lydia? Governess! Governess!

133
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,200
Where is Lydia?

134
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
She was sleeping right here, My Lord.

135
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,300
Where? Her bed is empty.

136
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,339
Lydia!

137
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:19,260
Lydia! O'Douis! O'Douis!

138
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,180
O'Douis, find Lydia.
Hurry up. Go, find Lydia. Go!

139
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,580
Why do you not speak?

140
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,380
Why do you not speak?

141
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,260
Speak up.

142
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,780
My Lord, we searched every nook..

143
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,420
..and corner of the palace
but couldn't find her.

144
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,900
Silence. "Couldn't find her."

145
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,380
Couldn't find her, indeed.

146
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,460
Search for her, you scoundrels.
Search for her.

147
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,260
I know it in my heart.
This must be an evil Jew's work.

148
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,899
Search the home of every Jew.
Set their homes ablaze.

149
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,780
Do anything but get my Lydia back.

150
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,253
Go. Immediately. Right now!

151
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,699
Master. I have brought here
the apple of the enemy's eye.

152
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,540
Take this dagger and hack the
little one of Brutus into pieces.

153
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh. Grief has turned him to stone.

154
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:42,900
I presume I shall have to avenge
innocent Elijah's odious killing.

155
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,300
Father.
- Who is it?

156
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,220
Father.
- Who is it?

157
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,540
Father.
- Elijah. Elijah, my child.

158
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,660
She is not Elijah but the object of
vengeance for Elijah's death, Master.

159
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:58,600
The light of the tyrant Brutus' eyes.

160
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,139
Stab this dagger on her and
douse the raging fires of hatred.

161
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,860
No, Emmanuel. What wrong
has this innocent done?

162
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,200
Blood for blood,
Master. Here, take this.

163
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,200
No. No, Emmanuel. No.

164
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,340
You falter. If your hands tremble,
then I shall slay her.

165
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,820
I shall slay her.

166
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,540
Emmanuel.
- Elijah, look. I shall seek vengeance.

167
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,939
Let go. Let go of her, you cruel man.

168
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,940
Look. Just look at that.

169
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,600
Even she calls me
father just like Elijah did.

170
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:39,860
Fear not, my dear. From this day,
you will take Elijah's place.

171
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,140
Emmanuel, I have found my Elijah.

172
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,980
Open the door.

173
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,980
Open the door.

174
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,660
Open the door.

175
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,180
Master, Roman soldiers.
You must take the child away.

176
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,500
It is the decree of the
Emperor of Rome. Open the door.

177
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:04,620
No. I cannot keep
her away from me now.

178
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,600
No. I cannot keep
her away from me now.

179
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,820
But..
- Open the door.

180
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,540
Open the door.

181
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,699
Master, there is nobody here.
Escape from the back door.

182
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,460
It is the decree of the
Emperor of Rome. Open the door.

183
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,260
But, Emmanuel, you?
- I must stay back.

184
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,600
Or else they will follow you.
- But, Emmanuel..

185
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,220
Master. Go. For God's sake, go. Go.

186
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,500
Open the door.

187
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,530
Open the door.

188
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,950
It is the decree of The
Emperor of Rome. Open the door.

189
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:35,883
Open the door.

190
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:40,830
What is the noise for? Can you
not see it is so late at night?

191
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:42,562
Silence. Where is Ezra, your master?

192
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,443
He left the town this morning.

193
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:47,122
We want to search this house.
Where is the girl?

194
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,363
The girl?
- Yes.

195
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,963
The one whom you kidnapped
from Governor Brutus' palace.

196
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,883
This Roman man saw you.

197
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:04,203
But this Roman didn't see..

198
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:09,843
..how I hacked the tiny
child into small pieces..

199
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:15,643
Go. Look for her there.

200
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:29,283
Master, your slave..
has fulfilled his responsibility.

201
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:31,923
Goodbye.

202
00:21:18,203 --> 00:21:23,243
"This world, alas.
This world of ours."

203
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:28,443
"Is a place where Satan treads.
Life here is cheap."

204
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:33,683
"This world, alas.
This world of ours."

205
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:38,683
"Is a place where Satan treads.
Life here is cheap."

206
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:43,643
"This world."

207
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:03,243
"In the shadow of the sword we live."

208
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:07,163
"On beds of fire we sleep."

209
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:11,122
"Before blind prophets we bow."

210
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,723
"And to walls we pray."

211
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:25,323
"This world, alas.
This world of ours."

212
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:30,523
"Ruled by tyrants.
Oppressed by religion."

213
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:35,820
"This world."

214
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:55,443
"Terror is our king,
and death, our queen."

215
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:59,323
"Injustice reigns
supreme at every step."

216
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:03,123
"Hunger is what people
harvest all year long."

217
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:07,363
"Tears are what people drink."

218
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:12,243
"Tears are what people drink."

219
00:23:12,323 --> 00:23:17,363
"This world, alas.
This world of ours."

220
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:22,643
"The skies rain fire
upon parched souls."

221
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:27,322
"This world."

222
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:48,803
"The world continues to
change every single day."

223
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:53,923
"The world continues to
change every single day."

224
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,523
"But unchanged the fate
of the poor will remain."

225
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:05,763
"Destined never to
smile and to weep forever."

226
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,563
"Destined never to
smile and to weep forever."

227
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:15,603
"This world, alas.
This world of ours."

228
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:20,963
"The downtrodden are sneered at.
The helpless are oppressed."

229
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:36,163
"This world."

230
00:24:49,763 --> 00:24:52,300
Salutations, Ezra.
- Salutations.

231
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:54,322
Is this where you live these days?

232
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:55,443
Yes.

233
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,820
You have got a nice house.

234
00:24:58,323 --> 00:24:59,723
Yes, Abraham.

235
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:07,723
How long it will
remain mine, only God knows.

236
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:11,883
Don't say that "God knows".
Say, "the Romans knows".

237
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:15,322
For quite some time now,
our God has left..

238
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:20,123
..the lives and deaths of Jews
at the mercy of the cruel Romans.

239
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:23,923
And He has made
Brutus the lord of hell.

240
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:49,683
Hannah. Hannah.

241
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,363
Thief.

242
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:28,403
Am I a thief? Then I will throw
these out of the window, father.

243
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,483
Don't do that. It is worth
ten thousand. Ten thousand.

244
00:26:31,563 --> 00:26:34,403
Shall I throw them out?
- Please don't, my dear.

245
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:37,203
Ruth, stop her. She
may just throw them out.

246
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:39,820
Don't you dare touch me.

247
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,803
Here, keep your gems
worth ten thousand.

248
00:26:46,123 --> 00:26:48,163
Is my child angry?

249
00:26:54,443 --> 00:26:55,763
Don't be, my dear.

250
00:26:56,923 --> 00:27:01,243
What would happen if the flame
were to be cross with the lamp?

251
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,243
The lamp would get extinguished.

252
00:27:03,603 --> 00:27:07,883
Dear, the best of these
gems are worthless before you.

253
00:27:08,123 --> 00:27:10,203
But these are what you love.

254
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:11,563
No, dear.

255
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:15,683
You are the one who lights up
the life of this unfortunate Jew.

256
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:17,723
Not these diamonds.

257
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:21,963
I do it for you.

258
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:25,723
So that I can buy every comfort
of the world for my dear girl.

259
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:33,430
..then take them and
throw them into the fire.

260
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:34,883
Happy?

261
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:36,843
Father.

262
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:38,362
My child.

263
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:44,745
There must be an
announcement from the Emperor.

264
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,243
Listen to the Emperor's announcement.

265
00:27:52,443 --> 00:27:56,300
All the citizens of
Rome are informed that..

266
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,883
..today, on the occasion
of the 20th birthday..

267
00:27:58,963 --> 00:28:05,430
.. of Princess Octavia,
the niece of the Emperor of Rome..

268
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:10,883
..a grand celebration will be
held before the royal palace.

269
00:28:11,163 --> 00:28:15,323
Where gladiators will fight
and sorcerers will weave magic.

270
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:19,430
And the chariot races, particularly,
will be a sight worth watching.

271
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:23,923
Every citizen may join
in the celebrations.

272
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:28,483
It is also decreed that
every citizen of Rome..

273
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,602
..will shut his business
for three days from today.

274
00:28:32,915 --> 00:28:36,283
And pray for the Princess' long life.

275
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:39,243
By order from the Emperor of Rome.

276
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:47,300
Signed under the
seal of Governor Brutus.

277
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:54,123
By Mercury, the
chariot races will be fun.

278
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,563
True.

279
00:28:58,627 --> 00:29:03,322
May you be damned.

280
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:08,495
Keep our businesses shut for
three days, decrees Brutus.

281
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,415
Disgusting!

282
00:29:38,835 --> 00:29:41,975
Princess Octavia. By the Gods,
the moon pales..

283
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,976
..before her bewitching youth.

284
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,815
She doesn't belong to you or me.

285
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:52,656
Well, the Gods have erred.

286
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:07,256
Princess. The garden seems
to be desperate for spring.

287
00:30:08,816 --> 00:30:14,560
I am looking out for Prince Marcus.
He will never change. Not even today.

288
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:18,536
Why should he?
God has made him handsome.

289
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:24,335
Yasmine, do you see him the way I do?

290
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:27,696
No, no, no.
How can I dare do that, Princess?

291
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:32,150
I only pray that the
Emperor returns soon..

292
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,896
..and you two get married soon.

293
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:49,560
Brutus.
- No, don't.

294
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:56,296
Prince Marcus is not to be seen.

295
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:58,616
Even I await him, My Lord.

296
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:02,176
I think it is pointless
to wait for him anymore.

297
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:04,576
As you wish, My Lord.

298
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:57,816
Prince Marcus is
still not here, Yasmine.

299
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,336
He must be on the way.

300
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,496
Do not touch him.
He is a wretched Roman.

301
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:54,296
But he is wounded.
Fetch some water quickly.

302
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:55,416
Go.
- Okay.

303
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:12,304
Where am I? On earth? Or in heaven?

304
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:16,184
Please remain quiet, as it is,
your mouth is smeared with muck.

305
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,704
I have brought water.

306
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:33,263
The Roman soldiers are
on their way. Let's go.

307
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,264
But what about him?
- Wait longer, and we are doomed.

308
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,344
Come on, get up. Let's go.

309
00:34:42,264 --> 00:34:46,184
Are you all right? I'd told you
the horses are no good on a hunt.

310
00:34:46,264 --> 00:34:47,344
Let's go.

311
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:49,224
Why are you looking over there?

312
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,504
I said, let's go.

313
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:11,640
Please come in, Physician. Come in.

314
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:14,704
The patient's
condition is very delicate.

315
00:35:14,784 --> 00:35:18,172
He's wounded in one place
but says he's hurt elsewhere.

316
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:22,264
You are very naughty, Antonio.
Very naughty.

317
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,824
The wound is minor.

318
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:33,144
I will give you a balm.
Even the mark will be gone in a day.

319
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,240
Here, take this.

320
00:35:36,398 --> 00:35:38,544
Permit me to leave now.

321
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:42,904
Give a potion for smiling too.
He has forgotten how to smile.

322
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:49,104
You possess that potion,
Antonio. Not me.

323
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,784
Bear one thing in mind, Prince.

324
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:57,744
After applying the balm,
wash your hands properly.

325
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:00,464
The balm must never touch the eyes.

326
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:02,703
Or else, you will be
blinded instantly.

327
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:04,384
Okay. Goodbye.

328
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:16,944
Antonio.
- Yes?

329
00:36:17,544 --> 00:36:19,640
Well, yes, even I am leaving.

330
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:25,223
How are you, Marcus?

331
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,344
The wound is better.

332
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:29,584
Why then did you not
attend the celebrations?

333
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:33,424
I was not feeling too well.

334
00:36:39,194 --> 00:36:42,704
Marcus, without you,
all colors turn pale.

335
00:36:43,384 --> 00:36:47,384
All songs lose their melody,
all pleasures appear so dismal.

336
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:52,144
Come, join the
celebrations and sit beside me.

337
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,183
No, Octavia.

338
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,704
I seek to be excused today.

339
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:12,690
Marcus, do you want me to
yearn for you even on my birthday?

340
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,370
My eyes look out for you.

341
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,890
I am feeling a bit uneasy, Octavia.

342
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:22,810
I apologize.

343
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,370
Stop laughing. Remember the promise?
The one I catch is mine.

344
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,770
Yes, we do remember.

345
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,529
What if I catch all of you at one go?

346
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,410
Then all of us will be yours.

347
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,530
That's quite a good proposition. Good.

348
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,970
Considering the fact that you may
not find a man as handsome as me.

349
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,650
Do not run. Do not run.

350
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:01,900
As radiant as the sun I am.

351
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,210
And to all I shall bestow
my rays. Come on. Come on.

352
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,690
Where have the girls disappeared?
Where are they?

353
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,690
I caught you. I caught you.
My darling, I have caught you. - Antonio.

354
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,850
Yes?

355
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,330
You are enjoying yourself.
But have you thought of the Prince?

356
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,730
Marcus is upset. Go
and try to cheer him up.

357
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,843
As you wish.

358
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,650
"Go and try to cheer him up."

359
00:38:55,796 --> 00:39:00,890
My angels, come with me.
Come, come this way.

360
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,609
So how is the lovesick one?

361
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,930
Oh. It appears as if the sickness
has gone, and only love remains.

362
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:04,383
Antonio.

363
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,570
My mistake. Both are present.
The sickness as well as love.

364
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,900
Antonio, I request you to
leave me in solitude right now.

365
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:18,970
Solitude? If youth seeks solitude
then it is a malady, my friend.

366
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,690
..with the world's best known
cure, vibrant celestial beings.

367
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,970
Come with me.

368
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,552
Come. Sit.

369
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:05,592
Antonio, ask them to leave at once.

370
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:07,792
Antonio.

371
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:14,912
Do not abandon me like an orphan.
Take me along too.

372
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:47,632
Halt, you Jew. Or I will kill you.

373
00:41:58,112 --> 00:41:59,712
Master? In Jewish robes?

374
00:42:02,592 --> 00:42:05,552
And a secret, it must remain
at any cost. - So it shall be.

375
00:42:10,632 --> 00:42:11,992
Leo.
- Yes, Master?

376
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:15,511
Yes, Master.

377
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:28,832
Listen. Listen. Listen to
what a seasoned man says.

378
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:40,952
But empty these hands are not.
A treasure of magic they hold.

379
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:44,720
So, tell me, what would you wish for?

380
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:45,392
A lover. A lover.

381
00:42:47,552 --> 00:42:51,712
Why not wait for your
moustache to grow, young man?

382
00:42:53,672 --> 00:43:00,152
But do not lose heart. In this
bag are two nymphs just for you.

383
00:43:00,352 --> 00:43:03,551
Nonsense. Nymphs,
and in such a tiny bag?

384
00:43:03,672 --> 00:43:05,872
Do you not believe me? Okay,

385
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:12,152
Look here.
- Sir, stop fooling people.

386
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:13,632
Are these girls or playthings?

387
00:43:13,712 --> 00:43:16,320
Every lover is like a plaything.

388
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:18,392
Look.

389
00:43:19,352 --> 00:43:24,232
Oh nymphs in heaven,
set down to earth.

390
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:34,152
Create magic and turn
the playthings into lovers.

391
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:27,512
"In my solitude, at dusk and dawn
thoughts of you come to haunt me."

392
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,615
"In my solitude, at dusk and dawn
thoughts of you come to haunt me."

393
00:45:01,553 --> 00:45:06,872
"The heart is beyond control now,
eyes are all that remain now."

394
00:45:06,952 --> 00:45:11,312
"The heart is beyond control now,
eyes are all that remain now."

395
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:17,192
"A thousand unspoken
words the eyes conveyed."

396
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:22,232
"A thousand unspoken
words the eyes conveyed."

397
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:26,952
"A thousand unspoken
words the eyes conveyed."

398
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:32,312
"Many a time in the lonely nights
when on the moon I set my sight."

399
00:45:32,392 --> 00:45:35,249
"Thoughts of you come to haunt me."

400
00:45:37,512 --> 00:45:40,232
"My heart has become restless,
my eyes have a lost look."

401
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:44,952
"In my solitude, at dusk and dawn
thoughts of you come to haunt me."

402
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:08,952
"The heart was so crazy,
look what I have done."

403
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:13,912
"The heart was so crazy,
look what I have done."

404
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:19,471
"A malady struck me, look
what cure I have found."

405
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:24,632
"A malady struck me, look
what cure I have found."

406
00:46:24,712 --> 00:46:29,272
"A malady struck me, look
what cure I have found."

407
00:46:29,672 --> 00:46:32,152
"Somebody go and tell him."

408
00:46:32,346 --> 00:46:36,832
"Thoughts of you come to haunt me."

409
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:42,632
"My heart has become restless,
my eyes have a lost look."

410
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:47,512
"In my solitude, at dusk and dawn
thoughts of you come to haunt me."

411
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:16,712
"Under a false notion I
was that the story was over."

412
00:47:16,832 --> 00:47:21,592
"Under a false notion I
was that the story was over."

413
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:27,232
"Everybody has gone away
leaving behind a deserted look."

414
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:32,232
"Everybody has gone away
leaving behind a deserted look."

415
00:47:32,472 --> 00:47:37,112
"Everybody has gone away
leaving behind a deserted look."

416
00:47:37,352 --> 00:47:40,310
"But sure I am, a
thousand times I will say."

417
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:44,832
"Thoughts of you come to haunt me."

418
00:47:47,712 --> 00:47:50,592
"My heart has become restless,
my eyes have a lost look."

419
00:47:50,672 --> 00:47:55,432
"In my solitude, at dusk and dawn
thoughts of you come to haunt me."

420
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:18,792
Madam.

421
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:21,752
Why are you so late?
- It is been just a while.

422
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,952
Do not lie. You went
to watch the performers.

423
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:27,320
Go and buy some fruits
while I buy flowers.

424
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:28,192
Very well.

425
00:48:39,592 --> 00:48:43,832
May I ask, for how long will you
keep staring at that Jewish girl?

426
00:48:44,192 --> 00:48:46,312
I am not staring.

427
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:49,992
Only drinking in the
Jewish nectar with my eyes.

428
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:51,872
But for how long?

429
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:56,720
Until she gives in and
agrees to come with me.

430
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:58,592
What if she screams?

431
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:02,232
Well, my arms are powerful. And she..

432
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:04,672
She is delicate.

433
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:14,352
Fortunate are these flowers,
for you cast a glance at them.

434
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:17,760
Cast a glance at me as well.

435
00:49:17,312 --> 00:49:18,432
What do you mean?

436
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:21,472
When a Roman soldier flings
a flower at a Jewish girl..

437
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:24,766
..it has only one intent.
- To hell with such intents.

438
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:28,592
No, no, no. To condemn
love is a crime, my darling.

439
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,432
And crime is what the
Roman law vehemently abhors.

440
00:49:31,512 --> 00:49:34,552
Don't you dare. Let go.
Don't you dare touch me.

441
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,551
Leave me. Leave me.

442
00:49:39,632 --> 00:49:42,192
Not even your God can save you.
- Leave her, you brute.

443
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:43,872
A human being like
me is enough for you.

444
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:45,632
Move aside, wretched Jew.

445
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,712
Watch out.

446
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,272
Go, and inform father.
- Okay.

447
00:50:30,275 --> 00:50:31,630
Move back.

448
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:29,380
Oh, God. For long must
we endure this atrocity?

449
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,740
Dear, you are back. Hannah.

450
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:35,100
Father, you must embrace him first.

451
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,980
If not for him, wonder what
would have happened to your Hannah.

452
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,220
Son, I do not have
enough words to thank you.

453
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:45,260
You have bestowed this old
man with a new life today.

454
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,620
How do I repay..
- What are you saying?

455
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:52,340
I have done no favor. It is the
duty of a Jew to help another Jew.

456
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:54,700
Come, son. Please come inside.

457
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,339
You have made us Jews proud today.

458
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,420
Hannah, my child, bring
something to eat for our guest.

459
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,940
Why do you take the trouble?

460
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh. I forgot to ask
my benefactor's name.

461
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:24,340
Well, my name is Moshe.

462
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,940
Moshe?
- Yes.

463
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,420
That is a nice name.

464
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:34,580
But, son, I don't remember
seeing you here or at the synagogue.

465
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:38,525
Well actually,
I hail from Alexandria.

466
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:41,100
You must be here on business?
- Exactly.

467
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:45,600
What do you do, son?
- I.. My business..

468
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:48,300
I deal in diamonds and gems.

469
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,780
Fantastic. That is fantastic.

470
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,420
Hannah, our guest is
also in the same trade as I.

471
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,220
This is my good fortune.

472
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,980
I hope you will let me
benefit from your experiences.

473
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,100
An apprentice? - Yes.
- Never. Never.

474
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,820
I would rather have you for a son.

475
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:13,819
Moshe, my son, from now on,
consider old Ezra's house yours.

476
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:17,660
And as long as he wants..
- Father, let him eat first.

477
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,584
Of course. Eat, my son.

478
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,260
Are you going out somewhere, madam?

479
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,779
No.

480
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,460
Then, will somebody be coming here?

481
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,259
No.

482
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,460
Ruth.

483
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,740
Ruth. Ruth.

484
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,860
Should I tell him you aren't at home?
- Don't.

485
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,220
So what should I do? The
Master is not at home.

486
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,340
So what?

487
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,660
I am not going to permit you to
be alone with a young man, madam.

488
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,380
Hurry, Ruth, or he may go away.

489
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,380
He won't leave until dusk.

490
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,200
Master is not home.
- What?

491
00:54:43,445 --> 00:54:44,980
Master is not home.

492
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,980
Okay. And she?

493
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,340
She? She is in. Why?
You have some work with her?

494
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,940
I have work with you.

495
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,420
With me?
- Yes.

496
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:05,379
Tell me, what is it?
- Let me meet her.

497
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:12,460
Working at a pretty girl's
house can be such a problem.

498
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,620
Why?

499
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,419
There is no value for me.

500
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,140
This way.

501
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:47,540
Chat with the cockatoo,
while I go and fetch madam.

502
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,220
All right.

503
00:55:49,575 --> 00:55:50,785
Who?

504
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,700
Did you ask me something?

505
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,200
Don't stretch your neck too
much or it may get twisted.

506
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,259
Shut up.

507
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,660
Why get angry? I just said you
could end up twisting your neck.

508
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,819
Shut up.
- Pali.

509
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,460
Pali is very hot-tempered.
He got angry at me for no reason.

510
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,340
Ruth has spoilt him rotten.

511
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,288
Shut up. Shut up.

512
00:56:20,368 --> 00:56:22,140
Pali, he is a guest.

513
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,460
Oh, my dear.

514
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,740
Is he telling you or me?

515
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,740
He just keeps on chattering.

516
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,700
Can I be friends?

517
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,940
Can I be friends?
- With whom?

518
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,220
With your wise cockatoo.

519
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,600
Are you very keen?
- Yes, I am.

520
00:56:43,544 --> 00:56:44,620
Then go ahead.

521
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,700
Pali.

522
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,540
I extend a hand of friendship to you.

523
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,900
Pali. You fool.

524
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,820
Never mind. I have no
right to impose myself.

525
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,100
Oh, God. You are bleeding. Come here.

526
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,740
You are bleeding so profusely.

527
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:19,600
It is your hair that's
smelling so lovely, isn't it?

528
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,779
I am terribly sorry.
Stupid Ruth has spoilt him.

529
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,380
But I think your
Pali is in love with me.

530
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:29,460
Is this the way to express love?
- Then how does one express love?

531
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:30,779
Pardon?

532
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,540
It is bad manners to turn
your face away from a guest.

533
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,380
No, I was only thinking.

534
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,380
So was I.

535
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,900
About what?

536
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:51,820
How nice it would be if I were
to get what my heart seeks now.

537
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,980
A doll as pretty as the moon.

538
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:02,540
Then buy her.
- Money can't buy her.

539
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,859
Why not?
- Because she seeks my heart.

540
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,980
So give it to her.

541
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:09,900
I already have.
- Then?

542
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,380
I do not even know
if she has liked it.

543
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,500
Then ask her.

544
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,859
I am indeed asking.

545
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,700
What's this?

546
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,299
Why?

547
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,500
There should be something
left even for tomorrow. Right?

548
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,860
Yes. You must come tomorrow.
Father would be delighted.

549
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,860
And what about you?

550
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,200
Bid Pali adieu before you leave.
- Certainly not.

551
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,259
Why?
- Teach him the ways of love first.

552
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,740
Excuse me.

553
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,819
Goodbye.

554
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,180
Uncivilized bird. You don't
even know the ways of love.

555
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,660
Madam, then you only teach him.

556
00:59:33,924 --> 00:59:35,860
Oh, my dear.

557
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:38,263
"Oh, my dear."

558
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:44,303
"I have fallen in love with someone."

559
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:47,263
"What do I do?"

560
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:49,942
"Oh, my dear."

561
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:55,630
"I have fallen in love with someone."

562
00:59:55,143 --> 00:59:57,503
"What do I do?"

563
00:59:57,754 --> 01:00:02,703
"What do you do? What can anyone do?"

564
01:00:02,783 --> 01:00:07,823
"If you have lost your heart,
what can we do?"

565
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:11,220
"Oh, my dear."

566
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:31,503
"I was naive, I did not know."

567
01:00:47,423 --> 01:00:52,343
"I was naive, I did not know."

568
01:00:52,703 --> 01:00:57,503
"His look will make me lose my heart."

569
01:00:57,743 --> 01:01:02,903
"Neither would I have met him,
nor would I have lost my heart."

570
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:07,983
"That's my mistake,
how can I complain?"

571
01:01:10,743 --> 01:01:15,823
"I have fallen in love with someone."

572
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,622
"What do I do?"

573
01:01:17,703 --> 01:01:20,983
"Oh, my dear."

574
01:01:21,263 --> 01:01:26,263
"I have fallen in love with someone."

575
01:01:26,343 --> 01:01:28,863
"What do I do?"

576
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:33,823
"What do you do? What can anyone do?"

577
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:38,903
"If you have lost your heart,
what can we do?"

578
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:41,583
"Oh, my dear."

579
01:01:57,263 --> 01:02:02,462
"The one whose eyes have wounded me.."

580
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:12,703
"I will take a cure
for my heart from him."

581
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:28,143
"I will take a cure
for my heart from him."

582
01:02:28,423 --> 01:02:33,343
"Neither would I have smiled,
nor would he have come close."

583
01:02:33,423 --> 01:02:38,462
"That's what I have been
punished for, what do I do?"

584
01:02:38,543 --> 01:02:41,630
"Oh, my dear."

585
01:02:41,183 --> 01:02:46,143
"I have fallen in love with someone."

586
01:02:46,343 --> 01:02:47,982
"What do I do?"

587
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,583
"Oh, my dear."

588
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:56,743
"I have fallen in love with someone."

589
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:59,223
"What do I do?"

590
01:02:59,383 --> 01:03:04,223
"What do you do? What can anyone do?"

591
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:09,423
"If you have lost your heart,
what can we do?"

592
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:11,903
"Oh, my dear."

593
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:19,823
"What do I do?"

594
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:23,620
"Oh, my dear."

595
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,543
My Lord, the Princess is here.
- Which princess?

596
01:03:39,623 --> 01:03:41,503
Indeed. There are two nowadays.

597
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:43,230
One is yours, the other is Rome's.

598
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:46,623
Which Princess, Leo?
- The Roman Princess, Octavia.

599
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:50,623
At this hour?
- Yes, My Lord.

600
01:03:50,823 --> 01:03:53,220
You are a fool, Leo.
- Certainly not, Master.

601
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:56,982
Tell her that I am not in the
palace or the gardens. Nowhere.

602
01:03:57,903 --> 01:03:58,903
Go.

603
01:04:00,459 --> 01:04:02,623
Then where are you?
- In hell.

604
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:11,903
Where is Marcus, Leo?
- You mean my master?

605
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,663
Yes.
- He has gone out.

606
01:04:14,903 --> 01:04:16,620
Where?
- To hell.

607
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:19,103
What?
- I mean, I do not know.

608
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:24,230
Why? Did you not tag behind
him today like a faithful dog?

609
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:28,743
He said he wouldn't go hunting today,
so he wouldn't need a dog.

610
01:04:29,983 --> 01:04:34,423
Hadn't I asked you to remind
him about going out this evening?

611
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,983
I did remind him, but he had
to leave on some secret mission.

612
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:47,509
Please stop playing, Celia.

613
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:57,150
Heartless man. Cruel one.

614
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:58,830
Who, Princess?

615
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:02,630
Who else but the one to
whom I have given my heart.

616
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:08,990
Yasmine..

617
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,910
Am I not beautiful?

618
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,629
Does the mirror lie?

619
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,150
Would the mirror dare lie, Princess?

620
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,700
Then why does he not care for me?

621
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:22,990
Why do my charms not work?
Why does he spurn me?

622
01:05:23,516 --> 01:05:26,830
But..- I had told him that
we would go out this evening.

623
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:30,630
But he has gone
somewhere and left me desperate.

624
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,430
Princess, he surely must have
been compelled to be secretive..

625
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:35,510
Secretive? From me?

626
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:39,510
Yasmine, there are no
secrets between two people in love.

627
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:55,509
Look, Pali, listen
to me very carefully.

628
01:05:55,983 --> 01:05:58,230
You behaved very
badly with him yesterday.

629
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:00,703
If he does not turn up today,
then I will not spare you.

630
01:06:02,634 --> 01:06:04,543
Shut up.
- You shut up.

631
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,383
Who is it?
- "Who is it?" Nobody.

632
01:06:07,703 --> 01:06:09,679
What are you talking to Pali about?

633
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:10,863
You?

634
01:06:11,743 --> 01:06:13,743
I have been waiting for someone.

635
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:16,863
Oh, I see. Then I have
come at the wrong time.

636
01:06:20,103 --> 01:06:21,183
I will leave.

637
01:06:21,646 --> 01:06:23,743
Please don't.
- Why not?

638
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,623
How is your hand?

639
01:06:31,379 --> 01:06:34,103
The wound has healed but
the scar still remains.

640
01:06:35,383 --> 01:06:37,942
The mark of love does not go
away that easily, does it?

641
01:06:39,623 --> 01:06:41,783
Why is the dressing
not removed? - Well..

642
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:50,841
I hope it didn't hurt?
- What? My hand?

643
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:58,361
So that's where it hurts?
- Yes.

644
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:00,681
For how long will it remain?

645
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:18,520
Are you happy?

646
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:23,361
Why would I not be? I have
found something to live for.

647
01:07:31,601 --> 01:07:32,681
What's this?

648
01:07:33,441 --> 01:07:36,361
The necklace which you had lost
at the marketplace the other day.

649
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:40,881
But this is not mine.
- Everything is yours.

650
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:44,121
This dawn, its sunlight..

651
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:50,681
..me, as well as everything I have.

652
01:07:53,121 --> 01:07:54,801
You want to ruin me.

653
01:07:55,401 --> 01:07:58,881
That's because you don't
want a thing. Tell me the truth.

654
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:01,161
Me?

655
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:07,681
I have got what I wanted.

656
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:15,441
The necklace looks so lovely on you.

657
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:19,241
Indeed. Like fetters
binding a prisoner.

658
01:08:20,161 --> 01:08:21,241
Tell me something.

659
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:24,640
When will you be going home?
- Me?

660
01:08:27,481 --> 01:08:30,410
When death beckons me.
- Moshe.

661
01:08:33,528 --> 01:08:35,288
Did you ask for me, Princess?

662
01:08:37,648 --> 01:08:39,408
You look disturbed.

663
01:08:40,247 --> 01:08:43,407
Yes, Antonio, I am very disturbed.

664
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:46,688
I fail to understand anything.

665
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:52,928
Ever since the chariot mishap,
Marcus seems to be a changed man.

666
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:56,480
The chariot mishap?
- Yes, Antonio.

667
01:08:56,848 --> 01:09:00,488
Can you find out for me, in
which world he remains lost?

668
01:09:00,808 --> 01:09:03,768
Do not worry,
Princess. I shall find out.

669
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:06,647
I place complete faith in you, Antonio.
- Thank you.

670
01:09:13,928 --> 01:09:15,728
Yes, I remember.

671
01:09:56,168 --> 01:09:58,688
Why are you staring?

672
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:04,968
Am I pretty?
- Undoubtedly.

673
01:10:10,328 --> 01:10:14,928
Wash off the muck some day and
look at yourself in the mirror.

674
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:16,768
Even the mirror will
break with your shine.

675
01:10:17,768 --> 01:10:20,928
You look like a fairy.
A Persian fairy.

676
01:10:24,408 --> 01:10:28,208
No girl has wings. It is we
lover boys who give you wings.

677
01:10:29,968 --> 01:10:34,248
Augustine, look. There is
an admirer of mine here.

678
01:10:34,408 --> 01:10:37,128
Oh, no. Three would be a crowd.

679
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:40,407
Love blossoms best in solitude.
In solitude.

680
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:52,928
Get out of the way.

681
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:59,880
You are getting angry.

682
01:10:59,168 --> 01:11:05,248
It is unbecoming for a man
like you to fight this way.

683
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:07,488
Big brother. Big brother.

684
01:11:31,648 --> 01:11:34,368
Blind man. You broke my back.

685
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:36,528
Broke your back?
Is it a back or a big sack?

686
01:11:54,968 --> 01:11:58,928
What would you like?
Apples, pomegranates, grapes?

687
01:12:02,408 --> 01:12:04,928
This seems to be a new shop? - No.

688
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,728
But I give special
treatment for special customers.

689
01:12:09,968 --> 01:12:13,848
And who are you?
- Uncle, why not use a smaller fruit?

690
01:12:14,528 --> 01:12:16,568
He is my uncle. And he is a bit crazy.

691
01:12:16,648 --> 01:12:20,808
Crazy? My foot. Crazy? Am I crazy?

692
01:12:20,888 --> 01:12:24,248
Why should you be? But why do you
not realize that you are my uncle?

693
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:26,448
Indeed. I am his father.

694
01:12:26,528 --> 01:12:29,408
What? You are my uncle.
- Oh, yes. His uncle.

695
01:12:29,728 --> 01:12:32,528
And these are real fresh.
Plucked from the orchards just now.

696
01:12:32,608 --> 01:12:35,800
Yes. - Take this.
- And this one is from me.

697
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:40,800
How much is it? - How much?
To hell with the money.

698
01:12:41,768 --> 01:12:44,800
We don't need to. It grows on trees.

699
01:12:48,768 --> 01:12:50,208
Allow me to carry it till your house.

700
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:52,728
In spite of being a Roman,
you are such a gentleman.

701
01:12:52,808 --> 01:12:54,568
Who told you so?
- What?

702
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:56,528
Of course, I am a gentleman.

703
01:12:57,408 --> 01:12:59,528
Do you go to reach every
customer in this fashion?

704
01:13:00,608 --> 01:13:03,808
Well, that's a family trade. Let's go.

705
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:13,858
You must be tired.
- Not at all.

706
01:13:14,369 --> 01:13:18,808
If need be, I could
even carry a customer.

707
01:13:19,101 --> 01:13:20,329
Really?
- Yes.

708
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,633
Give it. This is my house.

709
01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:26,929
Is this your house?
- Yes.

710
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,489
But why do you go to the market?

711
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:39,129
And who do you think I am?
- Are you the maid?

712
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:40,889
This..

713
01:13:40,969 --> 01:13:42,609
This house belongs to my Master,
Ezra, the jeweler.

714
01:13:42,689 --> 01:13:45,900
Oh, yes. I have heard
about Ezra, the jeweler..

715
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:51,570
No. He has a daughter.
Her name is Hannah.

716
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:52,648
The three of us live here.

717
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:56,289
Three? Lies. There must be a
fourth person who visits here.

718
01:13:56,369 --> 01:13:57,969
Shut up. No one else comes here.

719
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:01,625
Will you leave, or
should I call the others?

720
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,849
Sure. Provided they are pretty.

721
01:14:04,929 --> 01:14:06,809
Isaac.
- Louder.

722
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:10,169
Jacob. - Isaac. Jacob.
These are names of men.

723
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:13,169
Mozart. - Oh, my God.

724
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,449
Jacob.

725
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,819
Escaped.

726
01:14:40,572 --> 01:14:44,395
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

727
01:14:48,595 --> 01:14:51,555
"Oh, heart of me, hide
not from me and answer.."

728
01:14:51,635 --> 01:14:55,955
"From now on, should I call you
by a name your own or my beloved."

729
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:02,515
"Oh, heart of me, hide
not from me and answer.."

730
01:15:02,595 --> 01:15:06,835
"From now on, should I call you
by a name your own or my beloved."

731
01:15:06,915 --> 01:15:10,875
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

732
01:15:24,475 --> 01:15:28,595
"To you I listen and
will continue to."

733
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:32,556
"The torment I feel I will conceal."

734
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:41,480
"How much more
should I control myself?"

735
01:15:41,421 --> 01:15:43,750
"Walking hither and thither.."

736
01:15:46,235 --> 01:15:49,594
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

737
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,595
"Oh, heart of me, hide
not from me and answer.."

738
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:57,350
"From now on, should I call you
by a name your own or my beloved."

739
01:15:57,115 --> 01:16:00,795
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

740
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:23,115
"Oh, eyes so intoxicating,
what have you done?"

741
01:16:23,195 --> 01:16:26,995
"For what do you seek vengeance?"

742
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,755
"An effect so
devastating these eyes had on me.."

743
01:16:31,835 --> 01:16:35,897
"That my heart was beyond my control."

744
01:16:35,977 --> 01:16:37,595
"Walking hither and thither.."

745
01:16:40,675 --> 01:16:43,995
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

746
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:51,475
"From now on, should I call you
by a name your own or my beloved."

747
01:16:51,555 --> 01:16:55,355
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

748
01:17:08,794 --> 01:17:12,755
"My thoughts are all about you.
I grieve too only for you."

749
01:17:17,275 --> 01:17:21,195
"To even my slumber I say.."

750
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:25,755
"Let him be present
even in my dreams."

751
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:27,155
"Walking hither and thither.."

752
01:17:30,235 --> 01:17:33,554
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

753
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:36,555
"Oh, heart of me, hide
not from me and answer.."

754
01:17:36,635 --> 01:17:40,915
"From now on, should I call you
by a name your own or my beloved."

755
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:44,394
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

756
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:47,235
"Oh, heart of me, hide
not from me and answer.."

757
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:51,674
"From now on, should I call you
by a name your own or my beloved."

758
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:55,115
"Walking hither and
thither came along someone."

759
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,453
Welcome, Emperor. Welcome.

760
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:44,293
By the grace of God,
may you live long.

761
01:18:59,853 --> 01:19:03,733
I do not know either.
Perhaps he has gone hunting

762
01:19:06,137 --> 01:19:08,333
He remains unfettered
by responsibilities.

763
01:19:09,253 --> 01:19:12,973
The zeal of youth is
like a gust of strong wind.

764
01:19:15,979 --> 01:19:18,573
I too have lived
through such years, Octavia.

765
01:19:19,173 --> 01:19:22,933
But, my dear, your marriage
must not be delayed any further.

766
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,492
There is a difference between
coyness and refusal, Octavia.

767
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:33,150
Are you not happy with this match?

768
01:19:33,223 --> 01:19:36,175
I am happy, My Lord. I am very happy.

769
01:19:57,975 --> 01:20:01,550
Take a look at this diamond,
Moshe. It is so extraordinary.

770
01:20:01,695 --> 01:20:03,695
It is indeed very extraordinary.

771
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:06,295
Truly exquisite and flawless.

772
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:13,815
But, father, one needs to be very
lucky to get something as exquisite.

773
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,405
With hard work and sacrifice.

774
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:25,485
How do you like her reply?
None can defeat my daughter.

775
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,450
Who could it be at this hour?

776
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:34,925
Ruth. - Yes?

777
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,245
Go and see who is at the door.

778
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,885
Is this the jeweler Ezra's house?

779
01:20:56,405 --> 01:20:57,445
Please come.

780
01:20:59,238 --> 01:21:00,845
Princess Octavia.

781
01:21:00,925 --> 01:21:02,685
Blessed am I.

782
01:21:03,165 --> 01:21:08,485
Thank you for coming here.
What can this slave do for you?

783
01:21:08,765 --> 01:21:10,445
Are you Ezra, the jeweler?

784
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:12,844
Yes, Princess. Please be seated.

785
01:21:19,161 --> 01:21:20,780
Moshe. What are you doing?

786
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:23,205
Look at that apple there.
- Forget the apple.

787
01:21:23,285 --> 01:21:24,925
I must get it.
- Forget it.

788
01:21:25,646 --> 01:21:29,525
The axle of my chariot is broken.
Please have it repaired.

789
01:21:30,364 --> 01:21:32,804
I must return early. Or
the Emperor will be anxious.

790
01:21:32,965 --> 01:21:34,525
Do not worry, Princess.

791
01:21:34,805 --> 01:21:38,805
Till the chariot gets repaired,
please rest here.

792
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:42,485
Hannah, go and get
some fruits and sherbet.

793
01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:43,885
Very well, father.

794
01:21:48,765 --> 01:21:52,405
If you wish, you may
look at these jewels.

795
01:21:53,245 --> 01:21:57,288
Where are you going, Moshe?
- To.. to fix the chariot.

796
01:21:57,368 --> 01:22:02,125
No, no. You must stay here.
Look after the royal guests.

797
01:22:02,205 --> 01:22:05,285
Such a guest could
craft a man's destiny.

798
01:22:05,365 --> 01:22:06,925
I will attend to the chariot.

799
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:08,890
Don't take..

800
01:22:16,245 --> 01:22:18,565
Yasmine, this is lovely.

801
01:22:18,885 --> 01:22:21,565
Princess, just take
a look at that man.

802
01:22:21,805 --> 01:22:24,205
He bears a striking
resemblance with Prince Marcus.

803
01:22:24,525 --> 01:22:25,565
Ask him his name.

804
01:22:27,953 --> 01:22:31,445
Excuse me.
- Yes? - Who are you?

805
01:22:32,645 --> 01:22:38,165
A creation of God who
crafted this wonderful world.

806
01:22:41,135 --> 01:22:43,565
But why are you hiding your face?

807
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:45,965
The cruel woman will beat me.

808
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:49,205
Who will beat you?

809
01:22:49,525 --> 01:22:54,850
The one who is
preparing sherbet for you.

810
01:22:55,285 --> 01:22:56,845
But why would she beat you?

811
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:00,764
In a moment of weakness in love..

812
01:23:00,845 --> 01:23:04,325
..I promised her never to
show my face to another woman.

813
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:11,365
But we can be quite adamant.

814
01:23:17,365 --> 01:23:20,500
Are you a man or a rabbit?

815
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:25,885
A rabbit I am not.

816
01:23:40,805 --> 01:23:41,965
Who is he?

817
01:23:42,725 --> 01:23:43,765
Him?

818
01:23:44,565 --> 01:23:47,525
He has a gift of the gab. But
why doesn't he show his face?

819
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:49,485
He is shy.

820
01:23:50,365 --> 01:23:53,365
Shy? Or is he sold out?

821
01:23:55,885 --> 01:23:58,605
Princess, your chariot is ready.

822
01:23:59,245 --> 01:24:01,245
Thank you very much
for your hospitality.

823
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:07,165
I have selected some jewelry.
Please have it sent over.

824
01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:09,605
With pleasure. Blessed are my stars.

825
01:24:24,205 --> 01:24:26,365
Yes. But why were
you hiding from them?

826
01:24:26,445 --> 01:24:29,245
Me? Of course not. When did I hide?

827
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:31,764
I was only..

828
01:24:32,845 --> 01:24:33,885
Listen..

829
01:24:34,388 --> 01:24:36,245
That woman..
- The Princess?

830
01:24:36,445 --> 01:24:41,724
No. Her slave. She was staring at me.

831
01:24:48,365 --> 01:24:50,844
I will leave now.

832
01:24:55,245 --> 01:24:58,125
Strange are Your ways, God.

833
01:24:58,205 --> 01:25:00,165
Strange are the ways
which destiny leads one to.

834
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:03,804
The Princess of Rome comes
to the door of a petty Jew.

835
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:08,245
Moshe. - Excuse me. Permit
to leave. - So soon? No way.

836
01:25:08,325 --> 01:25:10,165
You cannot leave until night, today.

837
01:25:10,365 --> 01:25:11,925
Why? Anything special?

838
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:15,845
It is an auspicious day today.

839
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:22,325
Oh, yes. I will be
surely coming tonight.

840
01:25:22,405 --> 01:25:24,565
Do come. Do come.

841
01:25:32,685 --> 01:25:34,165
I am at your service, My Lord.

842
01:25:35,485 --> 01:25:37,325
I was eager to see you, Marcus.

843
01:25:42,285 --> 01:25:43,485
Very well, My Lord.

844
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:49,840
I wish to bind your wayward feet
with fetters of responsibility.

845
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:52,844
With the passing of
this phase of the moon..

846
01:25:52,925 --> 01:25:55,125
..I want you to get married.

847
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:58,850
Do you comply with my wishes?

848
01:26:00,925 --> 01:26:01,965
Why are you silent?

849
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:09,804
Marcus. I shall
overlook your audaciousness.

850
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:12,165
Go. You are given time to think.

851
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:15,943
I would also seek the freedom
to decide for myself, My Lord.

852
01:26:53,805 --> 01:26:54,845
Son..

853
01:27:00,725 --> 01:27:05,450
My fellow-brothers, eating
this holy bread implies..

854
01:27:05,445 --> 01:27:08,217
..affirming our
allegiance to the true God..

855
01:27:08,297 --> 01:27:10,285
..and to the doctrine of
the religion of the Jews.

856
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:13,845
The one who eats this
bread is a true Jew.

857
01:27:13,965 --> 01:27:15,685
No doubt.

858
01:27:26,445 --> 01:27:27,724
Where are you going, Moshe?

859
01:27:59,133 --> 01:28:00,285
Moshe.

860
01:28:12,285 --> 01:28:15,805
You lied to father. Why did
you throw away the holy bread?

861
01:28:17,485 --> 01:28:18,525
Who said so?

862
01:28:19,805 --> 01:28:20,845
What's this?

863
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:24,365
I saw you drop the
bread with my own eyes.

864
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:27,850
No Jew would ever do that.

865
01:28:38,925 --> 01:28:39,970
Hannah.

866
01:28:40,845 --> 01:28:45,125
Do not touch me. I did not know
that you could lie even to me.

867
01:28:45,725 --> 01:28:48,605
Do not cast suspicions
inside a heart filled with love.

868
01:28:54,525 --> 01:28:57,405
Then why do you not
clearly say what the matter is?

869
01:28:58,765 --> 01:29:02,325
I am unable to
express what's on my mind.

870
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:07,850
I will tell my Hannah everything.
Everything.

871
01:29:07,165 --> 01:29:08,245
Hannah.

872
01:29:09,965 --> 01:29:12,205
You have guests at home.
So go inside now, Hannah.

873
01:29:13,165 --> 01:29:16,405
I shall wait for you
tonight near the ruins.

874
01:29:16,619 --> 01:29:18,850
No. I cannot come there.

875
01:29:18,485 --> 01:29:20,644
Do not be adamant, Hannah.
You have to come.

876
01:29:21,365 --> 01:29:24,165
No. Say what you must, here and now.

877
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:26,245
Dear, the guests are leaving.

878
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:30,445
If in my heart, lies love for you..

879
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:35,245
..and if my love for you is true,
then you will come there.

880
01:29:36,644 --> 01:29:37,685
You surely will.

881
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:23,679
"Madly in love with you I am."

882
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:31,959
"Of my love, very proud I am."

883
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:37,999
"You may believe it or not."

884
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:45,159
"But people sure will."

885
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:50,639
"Call it a streak of insanity."

886
01:30:50,959 --> 01:30:55,239
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

887
01:30:55,639 --> 01:31:00,390
"Call it a streak of insanity."

888
01:31:00,359 --> 01:31:04,519
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

889
01:31:09,839 --> 01:31:14,239
"Then only you are to be blamed."

890
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:18,679
"Call it a streak of insanity."

891
01:31:37,599 --> 01:31:42,790
"The heart yearns only for you."

892
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:46,479
"In love I am, only with you."

893
01:31:46,799 --> 01:31:51,439
"The heart yearns only for you."

894
01:31:51,559 --> 01:31:55,719
"In love I am, only with you."

895
01:31:56,199 --> 01:32:00,398
"You may or may not come here."

896
01:32:00,759 --> 01:32:05,119
"But wait I will for you."

897
01:32:05,519 --> 01:32:09,759
"Call it a streak of insanity."

898
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:14,358
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

899
01:32:14,748 --> 01:32:23,678
"If this you fail to fathom
then only you are to be blamed."

900
01:32:23,759 --> 01:32:28,119
"Call it a streak of insanity."

901
01:32:46,799 --> 01:32:51,319
"In such solitude and wilderness.."

902
01:32:51,476 --> 01:32:55,558
"Stifled to death I will be."

903
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,839
"Stifled to death I will be."

904
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:09,518
"Beckon me a million times then."

905
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:14,119
"But return I will never."

906
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:18,719
"Call it a streak of insanity."

907
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:27,879
"If this you fail to fathom.."

908
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:32,558
"Then only you are to be blamed."

909
01:33:32,799 --> 01:33:36,919
"Call it a streak of insanity."

910
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:41,999
"Call it a streak of insanity."

911
01:33:43,442 --> 01:33:44,479
Moshe.

912
01:33:52,759 --> 01:33:54,359
I was sure you would come.

913
01:33:56,439 --> 01:33:57,759
Come close to me, Hannah.

914
01:33:58,876 --> 01:34:01,359
Look, how my heart
implores before you.

915
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,319
For peace. For love.

916
01:34:05,772 --> 01:34:07,559
Convince me, Moshe.

917
01:34:07,999 --> 01:34:14,790
Compel me to
understand whatever you say.

918
01:34:19,999 --> 01:34:21,390
Look here, Hannah.

919
01:34:23,217 --> 01:34:25,790
Look into my eyes.

920
01:34:26,758 --> 01:34:28,879
Moshe, your body
burns with high fever.

921
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:32,679
My soul burns in the fires
of love, Hannah. Douse it.

922
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:36,159
What.. what am I to do?

923
01:34:36,943 --> 01:34:41,639
Have faith in me.
Doubt not my love, Hannah.

924
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,359
Moshe, words are not
enough to quell away doubts.

925
01:34:49,508 --> 01:34:52,239
Tell me the truth. Are you not a Jew?

926
01:34:55,796 --> 01:34:57,160
Why are you silent?

927
01:35:01,999 --> 01:35:05,611
One word from me, and a
storm of sorrows may break free.

928
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,879
Our love may get poisoned
with hatred.

929
01:35:11,759 --> 01:35:14,319
Hannah, is it possible
that I could lose you forever?

930
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:18,239
Moshe. Tell me that
you are not a Roman.

931
01:35:18,436 --> 01:35:22,759
I am human. Captivated by
your love, and helpless.

932
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:26,799
Moshe, tell me that you
are not a Roman. Say it.

933
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:28,559
Hannah.

934
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:37,279
If humans are known by such names..

935
01:35:38,839 --> 01:35:40,446
..then yes, I am a Roman.

936
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:50,359
But there's no
injustice greater than this.

937
01:35:52,759 --> 01:35:54,639
No punishment harsher than this.

938
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,799
Don't touch me. You have cheated me.
What harm had I done to you? tell me.

939
01:35:59,919 --> 01:36:01,318
You have given me life.

940
01:36:02,646 --> 01:36:06,920
With your love, you have
brought light into my dark life.

941
01:36:06,172 --> 01:36:07,358
Lies.

942
01:36:07,719 --> 01:36:12,429
Oh, cruel man, wipe off the
false twinkle of love from your eyes.

943
01:36:12,883 --> 01:36:15,174
Do not look at me that way.
Go away, Moshe.

944
01:36:16,774 --> 01:36:20,540
Hannah.
- I wish to hear no more.

945
01:36:20,454 --> 01:36:22,334
Only because I am a Roman?

946
01:36:23,494 --> 01:36:26,534
Hannah, look not at my religion.
Look at my heart, my love.

947
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:31,494
I have seen steel, and I've
seen stone. Go away, Moshe. Go.

948
01:36:36,594 --> 01:36:41,374
Hannah, my love, your love has
pervaded every fiber of my being.

949
01:36:47,574 --> 01:36:50,773
In these lonely valleys,
I shall die a slow, agonizing death.

950
01:36:52,694 --> 01:36:56,940
Till my last breath, only your
name will be present on my lips.

951
01:36:57,494 --> 01:37:01,348
But this much, I do promise.
You will never hear my voice again.

952
01:37:01,429 --> 01:37:04,750
Enough. Enough, Moshe. Enough.

953
01:37:07,498 --> 01:37:08,933
Take me away somewhere.

954
01:37:09,552 --> 01:37:13,614
I can live with the
dishonor and seclusion.

955
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:19,214
But I cannot bear to be away
from you and lead a stifled life.

956
01:37:20,444 --> 01:37:25,534
Then, let us go to a place
where men do not fight over Gods.

957
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:30,894
Where even the shadow of this
traitorous world won't be cast.

958
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:33,534
Come, Hannah.

959
01:37:33,694 --> 01:37:37,374
Wait. Where are you running?

960
01:37:39,374 --> 01:37:42,534
This escape will be very difficult.

961
01:37:42,814 --> 01:37:46,214
You will be ruined by my curse
that will come from deep within.

962
01:37:46,294 --> 01:37:47,414
Father.

963
01:37:48,614 --> 01:37:50,414
Ungrateful Roman.

964
01:37:50,938 --> 01:37:53,614
Is this why you
entered my house as a guest?

965
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:57,774
To lead my daughter into sin?

966
01:37:57,854 --> 01:37:59,894
I will not spare you alive today.

967
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,334
Father. He is innocent.
- Step aside, Hannah.

968
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:10,693
Coward Roman. Have your
arms no strength anymore?

969
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:18,120
Do you have a heart, a
soul of a human being..

970
01:38:20,134 --> 01:38:24,349
Sly Roman. I am well aware
of your wicked Roman ways.

971
01:38:24,429 --> 01:38:28,694
You know nothing. Your eyes are
shrouded with misconceptions. - Moshe.

972
01:38:29,374 --> 01:38:32,755
In the name of religion, you
want to strangle true love. - Moshe.

973
01:38:32,835 --> 01:38:35,654
I want to rip the
weed off by its roots.

974
01:38:36,147 --> 01:38:38,734
I shall hang your body
at the crossroads of Rome.

975
01:38:39,254 --> 01:38:42,934
As a lesson to be learnt for
treacherous Romans like you.

976
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:49,614
I am in love with him. I am
the one who's caused you pain.

977
01:38:49,694 --> 01:38:53,334
Silence, you naive girl. You
do not know what you are saying.

978
01:38:53,454 --> 01:38:54,813
The truth, father.

979
01:38:55,374 --> 01:38:59,809
Give me my dreams, my love,
my desire as alms, father.

980
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:03,374
Never. Get out of my way.
Or even you will be..

981
01:39:03,494 --> 01:39:05,174
With pleasure, father.
Kill me. Kill me.

982
01:39:05,254 --> 01:39:08,733
I will give up my life at your feet.

983
01:39:14,134 --> 01:39:15,374
Alas.

984
01:39:18,734 --> 01:39:20,454
..has fallen for a Roman's lie.

985
01:39:22,254 --> 01:39:25,934
With great care, I had
nurtured my little girl.

986
01:39:26,934 --> 01:39:30,580
Little did I know that she
would punish me someday.

987
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:31,974
Father.

988
01:39:37,134 --> 01:39:41,894
Young man, this girl
is the light of my life.

989
01:39:42,459 --> 01:39:45,693
Even a moment's separation
from her would mean death for me.

990
01:39:46,854 --> 01:39:50,934
If you love her,
you will have to marry her.

991
01:39:54,734 --> 01:39:56,494
Undoubtedly.

992
01:39:56,854 --> 01:40:00,254
But before the wedding, all the
rituals will have to be observed.

993
01:40:01,214 --> 01:40:02,334
Fall on your knees.

994
01:40:05,374 --> 01:40:09,614
On your knees. You must
embrace the religion of the Jews.

995
01:40:10,174 --> 01:40:13,140
Hannah will not marry an unholy Roman.

996
01:40:17,854 --> 01:40:19,140
Did you hear that, Hannah?

997
01:40:19,716 --> 01:40:25,161
The infidel whom you were
dying for, refuses the sacrament.

998
01:40:25,241 --> 01:40:27,654
I refuse to abide by
these Sacrilegious practices.

999
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:31,120
These incorrect tests
of love with religion.

1000
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,733
Get out of my sight, Deceitful Roman.

1001
01:40:40,214 --> 01:40:43,614
You cannot stop true love,
my ignorant elder.

1002
01:40:43,974 --> 01:40:46,494
Love will break through the
shallow barrier of religion.

1003
01:40:51,654 --> 01:40:54,814
Moshe.
- Hannah. This is deception.

1004
01:40:54,894 --> 01:40:55,974
Come with me.

1005
01:40:56,334 --> 01:41:02,534
My child, the venomous snake
is trying to mesmerize its prey.

1006
01:41:29,229 --> 01:41:30,729
It is nothing. You may leave.

1007
01:42:08,602 --> 01:42:10,322
Do you plan to drown yourself too?

1008
01:42:13,162 --> 01:42:17,922
Can wine give you what you have
been pining for since so long?

1009
01:42:18,522 --> 01:42:20,882
For the one whom you have
put yourself in this condition?

1010
01:42:21,242 --> 01:42:22,922
You are right, Octavia.

1011
01:42:25,442 --> 01:42:31,522
I love her,
and I want to win her over too. But..

1012
01:42:36,162 --> 01:42:37,522
But someone else.

1013
01:42:40,802 --> 01:42:44,362
Then why are you here?
Who is holding you back?

1014
01:42:44,922 --> 01:42:46,201
Rome is.

1015
01:42:47,518 --> 01:42:50,502
And you are, Octavia.
- Marcus.

1016
01:42:51,786 --> 01:42:54,322
You may gain freedom from me.

1017
01:42:55,402 --> 01:43:00,820
But Rome..
Rome will never let go of you.

1018
01:43:01,362 --> 01:43:07,122
Rome's prestige, power and
future are in your hands.

1019
01:43:09,402 --> 01:43:11,602
You are Rome's future Emperor.

1020
01:43:11,974 --> 01:43:16,962
And that is what stands
in my way, Octavia. It is.

1021
01:43:17,367 --> 01:43:21,962
Yet, you will have
to become the Emperor.

1022
01:43:23,408 --> 01:43:26,922
You will have to sacrifice
your desires for your duty.

1023
01:43:28,322 --> 01:43:31,402
Marcus, you cannot
betray Rome or the Romans.

1024
01:43:33,522 --> 01:43:36,202
Rome needs the future Emperor.

1025
01:43:37,722 --> 01:43:39,410
And that's you.

1026
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:44,242
Rome needs a new
Empress too. And that's you.

1027
01:43:44,449 --> 01:43:45,722
Undoubtedly.

1028
01:43:46,282 --> 01:43:50,522
It is the desire of my nation,
and I cannot shatter Rome's desire.

1029
01:43:50,602 --> 01:43:53,282
Rome. Rome. Rome.

1030
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:59,282
How I wish there was a way out.

1031
01:44:00,281 --> 01:44:02,561
If not for Rome, there would
not be these grand palaces.

1032
01:44:02,641 --> 01:44:06,681
Nor the vicious grasp of the
empire which is stifling me.

1033
01:44:07,641 --> 01:44:12,401
Oh, to be away from these confines..

1034
01:44:19,281 --> 01:44:20,841
..where I..
- And she.

1035
01:44:21,761 --> 01:44:23,961
She, the one who has
snatched you away from me.

1036
01:44:26,321 --> 01:44:30,361
Marcus, do not weave a world
of dreams and get shattered.

1037
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:32,960
Like a mountain,
reality towers before you.

1038
01:44:33,961 --> 01:44:39,161
You must make me your queen.
Only your queen. Not your love.

1039
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:44,641
I know very well that
you can never be mine.

1040
01:44:44,921 --> 01:44:47,121
I have lost you forever.

1041
01:44:48,641 --> 01:44:51,960
Yet, we must bring
false smiles to our lips.

1042
01:44:52,721 --> 01:44:56,361
We will have to prove
that we love each other.

1043
01:44:57,321 --> 01:45:02,308
Marcus, not for ourselves but
for our nation. For our duty.

1044
01:45:02,538 --> 01:45:07,200
My lips can be silenced, Octavia.
But my emotions I cannot conceal.

1045
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:10,521
The raging fire may be doused
but its smoke can't stay hidden.

1046
01:45:10,601 --> 01:45:12,241
Marcus, you are the Crown Prince.

1047
01:45:12,321 --> 01:45:15,760
You can never break the fetters
of duty that bind you.

1048
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:19,721
A prisoner you are. And you will
have to complete your sentence.

1049
01:45:20,401 --> 01:45:23,201
Either with a smile,
or with tears in your eyes.

1050
01:45:59,281 --> 01:46:00,481
Duty.

1051
01:46:01,889 --> 01:46:03,361
Love.

1052
01:46:04,754 --> 01:46:06,100
Rome.

1053
01:46:16,961 --> 01:46:20,761
'Marcus. Do not forget your duty.'

1054
01:46:33,761 --> 01:46:37,601
'Marcus, do not tarnish our legacy.'

1055
01:46:37,681 --> 01:46:40,800
'A Jewish girl is not the
price to pay for our honor.'

1056
01:46:41,601 --> 01:46:45,321
'Marcus. Cupid's arrow
was shot at me too.'

1057
01:46:45,401 --> 01:46:50,810
'But I poisoned that beauty who
wanted me to forget my duties.'

1058
01:46:50,921 --> 01:46:53,161
'Marcus. Do not forget your duty.'

1059
01:46:53,241 --> 01:46:55,241
'Do not tarnish Rome's
unblemished prestige.'

1060
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:58,721
'Do not malign our lineage.
- Do not disgrace your legacy.'

1061
01:46:58,841 --> 01:47:00,281
'Do not put our souls to shame.'

1062
01:47:00,361 --> 01:47:03,121
'Marcus.
- Marcus. - Marcus.'

1063
01:47:03,201 --> 01:47:05,481
'Marcus.
- Marcus. - Marcus.'

1064
01:47:05,561 --> 01:47:07,241
'Marcus.
- Marcus. - Marcus.'

1065
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:10,681
Marcus.

1066
01:47:19,881 --> 01:47:23,721
The vast Roman Empire
eagerly awaits your reply.

1067
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:27,281
But, My Lord.. - I am not here
to hear refusals, Marcus.

1068
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:30,641
The wishes of millions of
Romans cannot be sacrificed..

1069
01:47:30,721 --> 01:47:34,840
..for your childish folly.
I will announce..

1070
01:47:34,921 --> 01:47:37,641
..that the wedding of Prince
Marcus with Princess Octavia..

1071
01:47:37,721 --> 01:47:41,760
..will be held at the Senate
tomorrow with great splendor.

1072
01:48:08,522 --> 01:48:14,322
"A gush of tears gets
unleashed as I think of you."

1073
01:48:14,402 --> 01:48:19,722
"My heart is set
afire as I think of you."

1074
01:48:19,802 --> 01:48:25,281
"Grudges I hold
galore as I think of you."

1075
01:48:25,362 --> 01:48:33,420
"What kind of a separation is this?"

1076
01:48:33,122 --> 01:48:40,842
"What kind of a separation is this?"

1077
01:49:02,442 --> 01:49:08,402
"The presence of grief
and pain is all pervading."

1078
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:18,401
"The heart now yearns to see you."

1079
01:49:23,282 --> 01:49:28,722
"The heart now yearns to see you."

1080
01:49:31,164 --> 01:49:36,522
"A gush of tears gets
unleashed as I think of you."

1081
01:49:36,602 --> 01:49:41,762
"My heart is set
afire as I think of you."

1082
01:49:41,842 --> 01:49:47,241
"Grudges I hold
galore as I think of you."

1083
01:49:47,322 --> 01:49:54,722
"What kind of a separation is this?"

1084
01:50:15,964 --> 01:50:21,362
"The whole world I would
sacrifice just for your love."

1085
01:50:26,402 --> 01:50:41,402
"A bond of love, so delicate,
how can I sever it?"

1086
01:50:44,482 --> 01:50:49,602
"A gush of tears gets
unleashed as I think of you."

1087
01:50:49,682 --> 01:50:54,682
"My heart is set
afire as I think of you."

1088
01:50:54,762 --> 01:51:00,161
"Grudges I hold
galore as I think of you."

1089
01:51:00,282 --> 01:51:15,322
"What kind of a separation is this?"

1090
01:51:24,129 --> 01:51:28,398
Hannah. Hannah, my child.
You are crying?

1091
01:51:29,479 --> 01:51:31,279
Do not cry, my child.

1092
01:51:31,959 --> 01:51:35,759
This old man still possesses
the courage to challenge injustice.

1093
01:51:36,599 --> 01:51:39,599
But I will not be able to
bear seeing you shed tears.

1094
01:51:39,879 --> 01:51:42,390
Father.
- My child.

1095
01:51:47,999 --> 01:51:53,119
Tears have paled the vibrant
colors of my little darling.

1096
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:55,390
Cry no more, my child.

1097
01:51:55,399 --> 01:51:58,239
I tried hard to hold
back my tears, father.

1098
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:02,199
I am the one who deserves to
be punished for this offense.

1099
01:52:02,839 --> 01:52:05,199
I have inflicted injustice on you.

1100
01:52:05,959 --> 01:52:10,279
A whiff of cool breeze had
turned into a gusty storm.

1101
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:14,799
How could the gardener entrust
a delicate blossom at its mercy?

1102
01:52:16,118 --> 01:52:19,799
Even shedding tears of
blood does not melt stones.

1103
01:52:20,519 --> 01:52:23,519
Why then do you weep for
that treacherous Roman?

1104
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:26,719
Wipe your tears, dear.

1105
01:52:33,199 --> 01:52:34,959
But have you ever thought..

1106
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:44,390
My dear, my days are numbered now.

1107
01:52:44,879 --> 01:52:49,790
If you wish to see your aged
father live for some more days..

1108
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:52,359
..then cast away
this shroud of sorrow.

1109
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:59,279
You should face problems
with courage, not tears.

1110
01:53:00,279 --> 01:53:04,799
Where from do I seek courage, father?
The tears flow at will.

1111
01:53:05,239 --> 01:53:07,438
Even I can weep, my dear.

1112
01:53:08,199 --> 01:53:10,398
But with a smile, I say..

1113
01:53:11,239 --> 01:53:14,959
Dear God, keep me as You will,
and I shall be happy.

1114
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:18,439
In Your happiness, I rejoice.

1115
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:22,639
Your slave, I am. My Master, You are.

1116
01:53:32,519 --> 01:53:35,359
Even we have been invited.
You will also come, won't you?

1117
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:38,390
No, father.

1118
01:53:38,279 --> 01:53:41,790
The unfortunate are not
taken for joyous occasions.

1119
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,790
It is ominous.
- You must not say that, my dear.

1120
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:46,599
Come on, let's go inside.

1121
01:55:05,519 --> 01:55:07,279
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1122
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:09,679
"..but a naive man can't fathom so."

1123
01:55:09,759 --> 01:55:11,759
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1124
01:55:11,839 --> 01:55:13,839
"..but a naive man can't fathom so."

1125
01:55:13,959 --> 01:55:18,119
"The cruel one only
stares from a distance afar."

1126
01:55:18,199 --> 01:55:20,159
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1127
01:55:20,279 --> 01:55:22,359
"..but a naive man can't fathom so."

1128
01:55:22,439 --> 01:55:24,279
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1129
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:26,199
"..but a naive man can't fathom so."

1130
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,439
"The cruel one only
stares from a distance afar."

1131
01:55:30,519 --> 01:55:33,479
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1132
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:54,119
"The one for whom
I laid awake all night.."

1133
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:01,719
"..could care no
less about my plight."

1134
01:56:05,399 --> 01:56:09,359
"The one for whom
I laid awake all night.."

1135
01:56:09,519 --> 01:56:12,879
"..could care no
less about my plight."

1136
01:56:12,959 --> 01:56:16,919
"The season of love is in the air,
And my heart is set afire."

1137
01:56:16,999 --> 01:56:21,390
"The season of love is in the air,
And my heart is set afire."

1138
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:25,239
"The cruel one only
stares from a distance afar."

1139
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:28,119
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1140
01:56:43,719 --> 01:56:48,639
"Spurn me not now."

1141
01:56:51,639 --> 01:56:56,639
"This is the reward
I have got for loving you."

1142
01:56:59,639 --> 01:57:03,559
"Spurn me not now."

1143
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:07,119
"This is the reward
I have got for loving you."

1144
01:57:07,239 --> 01:57:11,390
"A promise was so easy to make
but abide by it you could not."

1145
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:15,239
"A promise was so easy to make
but abide by it you could not."

1146
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:19,790
"The cruel one only
stares from a distance afar."

1147
01:57:19,159 --> 01:57:23,199
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1148
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:27,319
"..but a naive man can't fathom so."

1149
01:57:27,399 --> 01:57:31,584
"The cruel one only
stares from a distance afar."

1150
01:57:31,664 --> 01:57:34,159
"Storm of love rages in the heart.."

1151
01:58:44,835 --> 01:58:49,275
Let the sacred wedding
rituals begin, My Lord.

1152
01:58:55,530 --> 01:58:57,290
Come close, children.

1153
01:59:01,130 --> 01:59:08,900
Until eternity, may you
live happily ever after.

1154
01:59:17,410 --> 01:59:20,849
I have been wronged.
I seek justice, Your Majesty.

1155
01:59:23,970 --> 01:59:25,610
No, My Lord. No.

1156
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:29,900
If Roman justice perceives
the rich and poor as equal..

1157
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:30,970
..then my plea will be heard.

1158
01:59:31,730 --> 01:59:35,650
The court of Rome has
never denied the aggrieved.

1159
01:59:36,249 --> 01:59:38,788
But with what intention..

1160
01:59:41,806 --> 01:59:46,530
My Lord, once this
auspicious moment elapses..

1161
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:51,530
..there will be no room then
to seek justice nor a need.

1162
01:59:51,610 --> 01:59:52,969
Justice?

1163
01:59:53,210 --> 01:59:57,730
Fool. You stand at the doorway
of injustice, and seek justice?

1164
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:01,730
A venomous snake
spews nothing but venom.

1165
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:07,730
Let's go home, dear. We have been
given justice. Enough of Roman law.

1166
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:09,970
Silence, you impertinent Jew.

1167
02:00:10,410 --> 02:00:13,690
Do not provoke my anger on
a day as auspicious as this.

1168
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:17,610
If you have come to seek justice
from the Emperor, be courteous.

1169
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:23,170
Jewess, your plea has been
lodged at the wrong time and place.

1170
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:26,849
Yet, I shall hear. You will
get justice. Right here and now.

1171
02:00:26,930 --> 02:00:29,610
But, Your Majesty..
- This is my command.

1172
02:00:31,416 --> 02:00:33,570
What is your plea?

1173
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:37,610
May I ask, what sentence
the law of Rome gives..

1174
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:42,610
..to a man who traps a woman in
his love and then deceives her?

1175
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:51,370
..who promises to marry
a woman but leaves her to lead..

1176
02:00:51,450 --> 02:00:56,929
..a life of infamy and shame.
And then marries another?

1177
02:00:57,650 --> 02:01:01,290
In the eyes of Roman law,
such a man is undoubtedly a criminal.

1178
02:01:01,730 --> 02:01:04,570
And in the eyes of justice,
deserving of punishment.

1179
02:01:05,157 --> 02:01:09,690
Jewess, I wish to know, who is this
cheat who has been so unfair to you?

1180
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:21,100
My Lord, he is the one whom
the world knows as Prince Marcus.

1181
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:27,930
Immoral girl. Would you ever
have anything to do with royalty?

1182
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:39,170
Indeed. And you, oh Holy One,
speak of justice and fairness.

1183
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:43,250
Being a cardinal does
not give you the right..

1184
02:01:43,330 --> 02:01:48,650
..to twist royal justice
against the person who lodges a plea.

1185
02:01:49,330 --> 02:01:53,900
What a shame! Even the
Emperor's justice today..

1186
02:01:53,170 --> 02:01:57,500
..instead of favoring the poor,
favors the oppressor.

1187
02:01:57,130 --> 02:02:03,370
Jew. My justice and
reign do not favor any evil.

1188
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:06,929
It will not change to the
tune of the winds of fortune.

1189
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:10,930
Do not be cynical. I know my
responsibilities very well.

1190
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:17,290
Marcus, are the
allegations cast by the Jewess true?

1191
02:02:21,450 --> 02:02:22,730
Yes.

1192
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:26,500
Every single word.

1193
02:02:41,395 --> 02:02:44,195
Why this sudden silence?

1194
02:02:44,938 --> 02:02:47,715
Has the storm of justice calmed down?

1195
02:02:51,212 --> 02:02:52,812
Beloved Emperor..

1196
02:02:52,892 --> 02:02:56,412
..is your love for your son
being pitted against your duty?

1197
02:02:56,492 --> 02:03:00,920
Your Majesty, the
accusations of a mere Jewess..

1198
02:03:00,172 --> 02:03:02,892
..cannot be weighed with the
honor of the royal family.

1199
02:03:03,172 --> 02:03:06,571
The law is meant for the common man,
not for kings and princes.

1200
02:03:06,652 --> 02:03:10,932
Then cursed be your
justice and damned be your law.

1201
02:03:11,114 --> 02:03:16,371
A law that threatens the
weak and arms the mighty.

1202
02:03:16,452 --> 02:03:20,692
Which is opportune for you
but spells death for us.

1203
02:03:20,772 --> 02:03:22,520
Jew!

1204
02:03:22,772 --> 02:03:26,452
Were all of the world's
creations made only for you?

1205
02:03:31,652 --> 02:03:36,492
Your sorrows are painful?
But that of others, mere tales?

1206
02:03:36,892 --> 02:03:41,812
Your blood is blood? And ours, water?

1207
02:03:44,292 --> 02:03:47,972
Justice demands that
this wedding be stopped.

1208
02:03:48,212 --> 02:03:50,852
That, Prince Marcus
be taken into custody.

1209
02:03:57,492 --> 02:03:59,880
But according to Roman law,
cases involving the royalty..

1210
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:03,120
..have been decided
by religious decree.

1211
02:04:03,438 --> 02:04:08,120
Therefore, this suit must be presented
in a clerical court, My Lord.

1212
02:04:08,692 --> 02:04:13,252
So it shall be.
I do not wish to denounce law.

1213
02:04:16,532 --> 02:04:19,972
..that in the eyes of law,
the weak and mighty are equal.

1214
02:04:20,612 --> 02:04:26,612
Let him not enjoy any privileges
just because he is Crown Prince.

1215
02:04:40,412 --> 02:04:43,612
'How nice it would be if I were
to get what my heart seeks now.'

1216
02:04:43,692 --> 02:04:45,132
'And what does the heart seek?'

1217
02:04:45,532 --> 02:04:48,132
'A doll as pretty as the moon.'

1218
02:05:15,812 --> 02:05:17,120
Oh, my dear.

1219
02:05:44,892 --> 02:05:47,572
'Your love has pervaded
every fiber of my being.'

1220
02:05:48,492 --> 02:05:51,172
'At your feet, I shall end my life.'

1221
02:05:51,854 --> 02:05:55,772
'Till my last breath, only your
name will be present on my lips.'

1222
02:06:11,692 --> 02:06:12,772
Hannah.

1223
02:06:14,815 --> 02:06:17,371
Princess. You?

1224
02:06:17,612 --> 02:06:18,892
Yes.

1225
02:06:20,296 --> 02:06:22,252
I am here to implore for mercy.

1226
02:06:24,172 --> 02:06:26,692
Why must you mock at my helplessness?

1227
02:06:27,497 --> 02:06:31,772
What can a poor Jewess
give to the Princess of Rome?

1228
02:06:32,332 --> 02:06:34,732
Everything is in your
hands today, Hannah.

1229
02:06:35,372 --> 02:06:39,772
Marcus' future lies
at your discretion.

1230
02:06:41,252 --> 02:06:46,852
To make your love a success,
you seek the aid of a helpless girl?

1231
02:06:47,452 --> 02:06:49,772
Do not consider me your enemy, Hannah.

1232
02:06:50,932 --> 02:06:55,452
Even I am a woman.
I can understand the pain you feel.

1233
02:06:55,932 --> 02:06:59,972
But why have you shelved your
honor and come to console me?

1234
02:07:11,492 --> 02:07:17,812
The difference being, you are
triumphant, and I have failed.

1235
02:07:18,972 --> 02:07:21,932
Sweet words do not
soothe the heart, Princess.

1236
02:07:22,492 --> 02:07:24,932
If you had a woman's heart, then..

1237
02:07:29,572 --> 02:07:34,452
You have made a mockery of love
and robbed me of my love. Leave.

1238
02:07:34,532 --> 02:07:38,572
Hannah. - For God's sake,
go away. And leave me alone.

1239
02:07:39,452 --> 02:07:42,892
I will leave. But hear me out.

1240
02:07:43,919 --> 02:07:46,932
Because of you, the man you
love will be sentenced to death.

1241
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:50,972
Sentenced to death?

1242
02:07:55,412 --> 02:07:57,692
I occupy the seat of justice now.

1243
02:08:03,452 --> 02:08:09,652
..will affect not only you,
but the Roman Empire and its future.

1244
02:08:10,652 --> 02:08:14,332
In this court of justice,
I give you one more opportunity.

1245
02:08:15,172 --> 02:08:17,172
I ask you once more.

1246
02:08:17,852 --> 02:08:21,120
Are the charges made by the
Jew and his daughter true or not?

1247
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,612
I don't wish to
waste the court's time..

1248
02:08:28,692 --> 02:08:30,819
..by repeating my statements.

1249
02:08:31,132 --> 02:08:34,411
The allegations levied by the
Jew and his daughter are true.

1250
02:08:34,852 --> 02:08:37,932
No, My Lord. I wish to say something.

1251
02:08:43,372 --> 02:08:46,332
My Lord, the prince is innocent.

1252
02:08:46,412 --> 02:08:50,771
Hannah. - I take back the
charges cast on the Prince.

1253
02:08:51,212 --> 02:08:54,132
I made a mistake in
identifying the accused.

1254
02:08:55,492 --> 02:09:01,212
The same face, the same clothes.
Everything seemed identical.

1255
02:09:02,132 --> 02:09:05,520
But he.. he was not the one.

1256
02:09:05,732 --> 02:09:08,292
The Prince has not disgraced me.

1257
02:09:08,812 --> 02:09:10,852
My Lord, she is lying.

1258
02:09:11,252 --> 02:09:14,972
She wishes to burden
Rome's throne with her kindness.

1259
02:09:17,532 --> 02:09:23,492
So, the actual criminal
resembled Prince Marcus?

1260
02:09:25,252 --> 02:09:26,286
Yes, My Lord.

1261
02:09:26,557 --> 02:09:29,920
Is that why you crossed your limits..

1262
02:09:29,612 --> 02:09:32,532
..and accused the
Crown Prince of Rome?

1263
02:09:33,412 --> 02:09:34,732
Yes, My Lord.

1264
02:09:36,772 --> 02:09:40,332
And the Jew who screamed at
the top of his voice yesterday.

1265
02:09:40,692 --> 02:09:42,920
Why are you silent today?

1266
02:09:42,286 --> 02:09:46,612
Do not provoke me any further.
Put an end to this story.

1267
02:09:46,932 --> 02:09:51,520
If I speak the truth, your heart
will burn. And that's my word.

1268
02:09:51,332 --> 02:09:57,372
I swear by my helplessness that
the flames raging in my heart..

1269
02:09:57,492 --> 02:10:01,132
..are enough to burn
all of Rome to ashes.

1270
02:10:01,772 --> 02:10:05,892
But no. I cannot break her heart.

1271
02:10:06,852 --> 02:10:09,892
Today, the one I love has
compelled me to remain silent.

1272
02:10:10,892 --> 02:10:13,331
I accept the verdict
which I am destined for.

1273
02:10:13,532 --> 02:10:16,852
So much so, that I am ready to
obey your untrue verdict too.

1274
02:10:16,932 --> 02:10:21,172
If my verdict is not heeded,
the person will not be spared, Ezra.

1275
02:10:22,372 --> 02:10:26,532
Prince Marcus is declared not guilty.

1276
02:10:28,292 --> 02:10:34,452
Hannah, you wrongly testified
against Rome's Crown Prince.

1277
02:10:39,572 --> 02:10:44,120
And your father, Ezra,
was an accomplice to your crime.

1278
02:10:45,132 --> 02:10:51,652
For maligning the royal family,
you are declared its enemies.

1279
02:10:52,332 --> 02:10:56,332
And sentenced to death in
containers of boiling oil.

1280
02:10:57,532 --> 02:10:58,852
My Lord!

1281
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:07,190
What have you done, My Lord?
She is innocent.

1282
02:11:07,735 --> 02:11:11,700
She misled the court
because of her blind love for me.

1283
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:15,270
It is evidence that
matters in court, not emotions.

1284
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:18,270
But it is no justice to
sentence an innocent to death.

1285
02:11:18,790 --> 02:11:20,870
I implore you, My Lord.

1286
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:26,990
Kindly retract your verdict.

1287
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:32,750
This is my final decision, Prince.

1288
02:11:33,390 --> 02:11:35,710
The Jews ought to be
punished for their crimes.

1289
02:11:38,950 --> 02:11:41,870
Is justice blinded by your faith?

1290
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:44,870
Is your justice based
on hatred and prejudice?

1291
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:49,150
Marcus. Your words reek of rebellion.

1292
02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:52,710
Perhaps you forget
whom you are talking to.

1293
02:11:53,190 --> 02:11:55,790
In your zeal, you have
become devoid of your senses.

1294
02:11:56,110 --> 02:11:59,670
To speak against injustice,
is the duty of every human being.

1295
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:02,670
You cannot stifle the
protest of an innocent.

1296
02:12:03,470 --> 02:12:06,830
It will rise like gusty storm
from every corner of the world.

1297
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:11,712
And they will vanquish your
empires of injustice and slavery.

1298
02:12:11,792 --> 02:12:16,910
Silence, Marcus. Your wayward
tongue challenges my authority.

1299
02:12:20,430 --> 02:12:23,470
..which burns in my heart too,
like those of many others.

1300
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:25,710
Beware of the revolution, Brutus.

1301
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:29,590
Or it will consume
you in its own flames.

1302
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:33,150
Soldiers. Arrest the rebel.

1303
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:38,150
You will be given a very
light punishment for rebelling.

1304
02:12:39,150 --> 02:12:42,790
You will personally see
your beloved tomorrow..

1305
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:45,470
..being cast in
a container of boiling oil.

1306
02:12:45,990 --> 02:12:48,469
So that your
audaciousness is put to an end.

1307
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:50,950
And that a revolution
ensues in your world too.

1308
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:57,550
Forgive him? So that he gets to
challenge the justice of Rome?

1309
02:12:57,790 --> 02:13:02,470
Octavia, this isn't an insult of
Governor Brutus but of the Roman Empire.

1310
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:06,510
Whatever Marcus has done is
because of his naiveté, My Lord.

1311
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:15,150
And he will have to pay for it,
so that he never repeats it.

1312
02:13:15,230 --> 02:13:19,469
Yet, My Lord, Marcus
is Rome's Crown Prince.

1313
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:22,830
Can the law not grant him pardon?

1314
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:26,990
This empire belongs to Rome,
and the Roman law shall prevail.

1315
02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:30,830
Governor Brutus is the
judge of Roman justice.

1316
02:13:33,790 --> 02:13:36,710
My Lord..
- I am helpless, Octavia.

1317
02:14:16,793 --> 02:14:20,576
Leo! Leo!

1318
02:14:52,510 --> 02:14:54,390
Be patient, my Prince.

1319
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:59,990
My love and my life are
dying because of Rome.

1320
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:13,190
But as of now, you must bow
before Rome's law and justice.

1321
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:16,190
You term atrocity
and cruelty as justice?

1322
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:26,350
I deem it my duty to rebel
against such law and justice.

1323
02:15:27,350 --> 02:15:30,670
I shall have all of Rome
oppose Brutus' cruelty.

1324
02:15:31,110 --> 02:15:34,950
I shall unmask his façade.

1325
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:38,550
So that the world can see
his dangerous and true self.

1326
02:15:38,630 --> 02:15:41,590
Yes, Marcus. You can surely do that.

1327
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:45,630
But do not forget that you are
surrounded by Roman soldiers.

1328
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:48,870
You are a prisoner, Prince.

1329
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:55,110
Yes, you are right, Antonio.

1330
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:59,190
I am surrounded by the
protectors of Roman justice.

1331
02:16:00,270 --> 02:16:01,950
I am rendered helpless.

1332
02:16:02,990 --> 02:16:09,630
So that my innocent Hannah gets
destroyed, and I remain helpless.

1333
02:16:10,510 --> 02:16:14,830
That her screams die near the
executioners and I stay helpless.

1334
02:16:16,110 --> 02:16:22,190
I never knew, Antonio, falling
in love was so grave a crime.

1335
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:24,630
And that its punishment was so harsh.

1336
02:16:27,390 --> 02:16:34,700
Antonio, there is still time
for dawn. I need your help.

1337
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:37,110
Antonio can sacrifice
his life for you, Marcus.

1338
02:16:37,469 --> 02:16:42,590
But to think of a Roman
Prince pining for a mere Jewess..

1339
02:16:42,670 --> 02:16:44,950
Hold your tongue, Antonio.

1340
02:16:45,950 --> 02:16:49,230
I will not tolerate
you insulting my love.

1341
02:16:50,190 --> 02:16:53,230
You are alien to my feelings of love.

1342
02:16:56,270 --> 02:17:00,390
Antonio, you can neither hear nor
fathom the cries of my broken heart.

1343
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:01,510
Prince.

1344
02:17:01,590 --> 02:17:04,230
Antonio, I am going out of my mind.

1345
02:17:09,570 --> 02:17:12,549
What can I do for you? Command me.

1346
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:15,709
I am not capable of
giving commands, Antonio.

1347
02:17:17,709 --> 02:17:20,509
But I have a request to
make to you, my friend.

1348
02:17:21,230 --> 02:17:22,750
Fetch me some poison.

1349
02:17:23,628 --> 02:17:24,670
Poison?

1350
02:17:25,188 --> 02:17:27,300
Yes, Antonio, it is my last wish.

1351
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:29,750
I am your friend, not your enemy.

1352
02:17:30,673 --> 02:17:34,270
Ask me my life. But ask not
for something that I cannot give.

1353
02:17:34,670 --> 02:17:37,830
Unfaithful friend. Go away.
I do not even need you anymore.

1354
02:17:38,590 --> 02:17:41,389
I shall douse this raging
fire without seeking your help.

1355
02:17:41,629 --> 02:17:44,869
Remember, Antonio. One bent on
taking his life can do so in many ways.

1356
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:49,700
Marcus. Marcus. Marcus. Open the door.

1357
02:17:49,309 --> 02:17:54,869
Marcus. Open the door.
Marcus. Open the door, Prince.

1358
02:17:55,790 --> 02:17:57,710
I say, open the door, Marcus.

1359
02:17:57,830 --> 02:17:59,670
Marcus. Open the door.

1360
02:18:01,549 --> 02:18:05,750
Marcus, in the name of
our friendship, open up.

1361
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:08,389
Prince, open the door.

1362
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:12,710
I say, open the door,
Marcus. Open the door, Marcus.

1363
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:16,390
Open up. Or else
I will break open the door.

1364
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:20,990
Marcus. Marcus. Open the door.

1365
02:18:27,350 --> 02:18:31,350
Marcus, my friend. In the name
of our friendship, open the door.

1366
02:18:31,430 --> 02:18:36,550
In the name of your love, open up.
For Hannah's sake, Marcus, open up.

1367
02:18:37,469 --> 02:18:41,629
Open the door, Marcus,
or I will break open this door.

1368
02:18:41,709 --> 02:18:43,269
Marcus, open..

1369
02:18:54,950 --> 02:18:57,190
Marcus, your eyes..

1370
02:18:57,910 --> 02:19:03,190
I have hidden Hannah forever..

1371
02:19:03,270 --> 02:19:05,990
..in the safe custody
of my eyes, Antonio.

1372
02:19:07,510 --> 02:19:10,230
Now, nobody can
snatch her away from me.

1373
02:19:10,309 --> 02:19:11,629
Marcus.

1374
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:14,990
Antonio.

1375
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:20,700
These stone-hearted
people born as humans..

1376
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:24,750
Now, nobody can coerce me
to witness their atrocities.

1377
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:29,910
These blind people will
call me blind, won't they?

1378
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:31,950
Let them.

1379
02:19:34,629 --> 02:19:39,109
Antonio. Antonio,
do not leave me alone.

1380
02:19:42,510 --> 02:19:43,830
Marcus.

1381
02:19:44,389 --> 02:19:48,789
Just once, take me to Hannah, Antonio.

1382
02:19:49,395 --> 02:19:51,990
Just once, I wish to hear her voice.

1383
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:57,750
It would be enough for me to carry
on with this miserable life, Antonio.

1384
02:20:21,217 --> 02:20:27,900
Jews. The oils in those
containers eagerly await you.

1385
02:20:27,609 --> 02:20:31,769
Beckon your God now to save
you from burning in the oils.

1386
02:20:32,265 --> 02:20:35,490
Brutus, I do not fear death.

1387
02:20:35,757 --> 02:20:38,569
In any case, my days
are already numbered.

1388
02:20:39,115 --> 02:20:42,903
But look at this innocent
girl who has not even seen life.

1389
02:20:43,663 --> 02:20:45,983
I can spare both of
you on one condition.

1390
02:20:46,313 --> 02:20:48,263
Embrace the Roman creed.

1391
02:20:48,821 --> 02:20:51,190
I shall not sell
the garden fearing withering.

1392
02:20:51,644 --> 02:20:54,346
My life I will sacrifice but
intact will remain my integrity.

1393
02:20:55,163 --> 02:21:00,283
Brutus, our bones can melt
away in those burning oils.

1394
02:21:00,723 --> 02:21:03,803
But nothing can
waver our firm integrity.

1395
02:21:03,923 --> 02:21:08,403
Soldiers. Stop staring.
Throw them in the furnaces.

1396
02:21:09,803 --> 02:21:14,203
My Lord, the fault is mine. Kill me
if you must but spare my father.

1397
02:21:14,283 --> 02:21:17,523
I cannot bear to see
my father die with me.

1398
02:21:18,323 --> 02:21:20,723
Hannah. Come on.

1399
02:21:29,563 --> 02:21:30,803
Wait.

1400
02:21:31,963 --> 02:21:34,363
I wish to be kind to the girl.

1401
02:21:36,163 --> 02:21:39,243
Burn the girl first. So that
she cannot see him burn to death.

1402
02:21:39,323 --> 02:21:44,243
No, Brutus. I cannot bear to
see my daughter dying in agony.

1403
02:21:44,483 --> 02:21:49,123
Spare me this horrible sight and
kill me. But have mercy on her.

1404
02:21:49,203 --> 02:21:50,523
Take him away.

1405
02:21:50,883 --> 02:21:54,283
No. Brutus. Mercy.
For God's sake, have mercy.

1406
02:21:54,803 --> 02:21:56,830
Mercy?

1407
02:22:00,363 --> 02:22:03,483
Which man will not
melt hearing this word?

1408
02:22:04,205 --> 02:22:07,843
Cruel Roman.
Fear at least the justice of God.

1409
02:22:08,724 --> 02:22:11,123
Do you not remember
the anguish of losing a child?

1410
02:22:11,923 --> 02:22:14,403
Have you forgotten that
even you once had a daughter..

1411
02:22:14,483 --> 02:22:17,363
..whom somebody had abducted?

1412
02:22:17,843 --> 02:22:20,563
How do you know?
- How do I know?

1413
02:22:22,603 --> 02:22:27,363
I also know that Lydia is
not dead. She is still alive.

1414
02:22:27,443 --> 02:22:29,563
Lydia. My daughter is alive.

1415
02:22:30,443 --> 02:22:34,283
No way. You seek revenge. You lie.

1416
02:22:34,363 --> 02:22:36,363
Well, assume it is a lie.
Come on, Hannah.

1417
02:22:36,483 --> 02:22:39,643
Wait, Ezra. Do you
know where my daughter is?

1418
02:22:39,924 --> 02:22:42,903
Certainly. But I will not say.

1419
02:22:42,983 --> 02:22:47,403
You won't?
I will punish you so badly..

1420
02:22:47,523 --> 02:22:50,683
..that the skies and
the earth will shudder.

1421
02:22:50,763 --> 02:22:53,883
Go ahead. Why delay?

1422
02:22:55,803 --> 02:22:58,403
No. No, Ezra.
For God's sake, tell me, Ezra.

1423
02:22:58,483 --> 02:22:59,923
I won't.

1424
02:23:00,302 --> 02:23:03,200
You won't?
- No. I won't.

1425
02:23:04,323 --> 02:23:09,243
Ezra, this head has never bowed
even before the Emperor of Rome.

1426
02:23:09,403 --> 02:23:12,300
But I bow before you today.

1427
02:23:12,972 --> 02:23:16,563
Have mercy, Ezra. Have mercy.

1428
02:23:16,643 --> 02:23:17,923
Mercy?

1429
02:23:20,323 --> 02:23:23,883
For the first time,
that word has escaped your lips.

1430
02:23:24,403 --> 02:23:28,523
Perhaps you know now that it
is not only the enslaved Jews..

1431
02:23:28,603 --> 02:23:33,283
..who need mercy.
Even the tyrannical Romans need it.

1432
02:23:33,923 --> 02:23:37,683
But how can a poor Jew show you mercy?

1433
02:23:41,923 --> 02:23:44,443
Seek your tyrannical race.

1434
02:23:44,723 --> 02:23:48,830
You have never
taught us anything good.

1435
02:23:48,283 --> 02:23:51,842
Why should I show mercy to
the one who has never been merciful?

1436
02:23:51,963 --> 02:23:56,163
Ezra. Ezra, have pity on me.

1437
02:23:56,683 --> 02:24:00,203
Tell me. For God's sake,
tell me where my Lydia is?

1438
02:24:00,323 --> 02:24:03,300
I pity your helplessness.

1439
02:24:06,555 --> 02:24:08,203
I accept. Anything.

1440
02:24:08,283 --> 02:24:12,683
First hear my condition.
After I reveal everything..

1441
02:24:12,803 --> 02:24:15,963
..you will instantly cast
Hannah into the furnace.

1442
02:24:19,123 --> 02:24:22,523
And wait for Ezra's signal.
Go. Take her away. Tell me now.

1443
02:24:22,603 --> 02:24:24,430
Very well. Then, listen.

1444
02:24:24,643 --> 02:24:31,300
Fifteen years ago, you had thrown
my innocent son Elijah to the lions.

1445
02:24:31,923 --> 02:24:37,243
My servant, Emmanuel, swore revenge.

1446
02:24:38,163 --> 02:24:40,972
In order to douse those flames of
vengeance..

1447
02:24:41,681 --> 02:24:44,283
..he kidnapped your daughter, Lydia.

1448
02:24:45,403 --> 02:24:49,283
But my conscience and
my religion did not permit me..

1449
02:24:49,569 --> 02:24:51,162
..to punish an innocent daughter ..

1450
02:24:51,243 --> 02:24:53,443
..for the crimes of her father.

1451
02:24:53,999 --> 02:24:58,403
I was overwhelmed by mercy,
and chose to forget the past.

1452
02:24:58,483 --> 02:25:01,763
I raised your daughter as my own.

1453
02:25:03,708 --> 02:25:09,363
Yes. A Jew did. A Jew, who,
in your eyes, is born a criminal.

1454
02:25:09,987 --> 02:25:11,562
But where is she?

1455
02:25:11,643 --> 02:25:13,895
Where is she? Look there.

1456
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:23,370
Lydia. My child.
- Beware. Where are you going?

1457
02:25:23,117 --> 02:25:27,203
Soldiers, kill her.
- Stop. No. This cannot be.

1458
02:25:27,283 --> 02:25:28,723
Why can it not be?

1459
02:25:28,803 --> 02:25:31,963
Just because she is your
daughter now, and not mine?

1460
02:25:36,711 --> 02:25:41,883
Now that you know she is yours,
you are eager to embrace her?

1461
02:25:45,643 --> 02:25:49,643
Executioners, kill her.
- Wait, Ezra. Ezra.

1462
02:25:55,803 --> 02:25:57,830
Hannah.

1463
02:25:59,883 --> 02:26:02,483
Father.

1464
02:26:02,963 --> 02:26:06,363
Do not leave me, father.

1465
02:26:06,542 --> 02:26:10,603
I have no one else but you.

1466
02:26:10,683 --> 02:26:13,403
Don't cry. Do not weep, my child.

1467
02:26:15,163 --> 02:26:19,403
My dear, I cannot bear to see you cry.

1468
02:26:19,963 --> 02:26:25,830
Come, my dear, embrace
your father just once.

1469
02:26:26,283 --> 02:26:28,483
Your voice spews poison.

1470
02:26:28,923 --> 02:26:33,430
Your breath reeks of dead bodies.

1471
02:26:33,315 --> 02:26:37,830
My child, I am undoubtedly a criminal.

1472
02:26:41,637 --> 02:26:47,763
Just once.. just once call me your
father with these innocent lips, Lydia.

1473
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:51,203
Lydia is dead. I am Hannah.

1474
02:26:51,763 --> 02:26:55,443
My child. Lydia, return. Please.

1475
02:26:55,736 --> 02:26:58,482
Your crimes will return to haunt you,
and you will be punished.

1476
02:26:58,562 --> 02:27:01,243
But I am leaving this
world of hatred forever.

1477
02:27:01,323 --> 02:27:04,483
My child. Lydia. Lydia.

1478
02:27:12,937 --> 02:27:17,203
"Call it a streak of insanity."

1479
02:27:17,772 --> 02:27:21,803
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

1480
02:27:22,283 --> 02:27:26,762
"Call it a streak of insanity."

1481
02:27:26,923 --> 02:27:31,363
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

1482
02:27:31,843 --> 02:27:36,243
"If this you fail to fathom.."

1483
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:40,763
"..then only you are to be blamed."

1484
02:28:01,643 --> 02:28:03,763
I have nothing left now.

1485
02:28:04,974 --> 02:28:10,385
Have mercy on a lifeless soul,
Prince, and leave me alone.

1486
02:28:10,826 --> 02:28:15,134
So that I can find a grave
for myself in some corner.

1487
02:28:15,215 --> 02:28:16,363
No, Hannah. No.

1488
02:28:16,563 --> 02:28:20,404
Look, I am begging of you
with folded hands. I have lost.

1489
02:28:24,966 --> 02:28:28,203
I accept that my
desires have perished.

1490
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:31,820
My dreams have been burnt to ashes.

1491
02:28:31,396 --> 02:28:35,130
But don't impose yourself upon
a helpless woman.

1492
02:28:35,210 --> 02:28:37,443
Go away, Prince. Go away.

1493
02:28:40,998 --> 02:28:44,523
Certain constraints killed my love.

1494
02:28:46,321 --> 02:28:50,323
With my own merciless hands, I have
taken out the light of my heart.

1495
02:28:51,391 --> 02:28:54,643
Hannah, there's
present a frightful darkness.

1496
02:28:55,664 --> 02:28:58,523
And this life seems like one long,
never ending journey.

1497
02:28:59,394 --> 02:29:01,805
This path is so..
- Moshe.

1498
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:10,402
Moshe.

1499
02:29:12,180 --> 02:29:16,830
Your eyes? What have you done?

1500
02:29:17,225 --> 02:29:19,163
I have been punished for my crime.

1501
02:29:20,762 --> 02:29:23,643
I have paid for the
innocent tears that you had shed.

1502
02:29:24,804 --> 02:29:26,443
I have found immense peace now.

1503
02:29:26,923 --> 02:29:31,533
Moshe. Moshe, I seek your forgiveness.

1504
02:29:31,613 --> 02:29:37,162
Overwhelm me with your love once
again. Take me in your arms, Moshe.

1505
02:29:42,975 --> 02:29:44,375
Hannah.

1506
02:29:44,815 --> 02:29:50,895
In the far distance,
I can see the first ray of a new dawn.

1507
02:29:54,992 --> 02:30:00,295
Come, Moshe, let us
touch this new light.

1508
02:30:01,295 --> 02:30:04,775
Let this new dawn be
witness to our love.

1509
02:30:05,953 --> 02:30:07,150
Come.

1510
02:30:10,575 --> 02:30:15,455
"Call it a streak of insanity."

1511
02:30:15,535 --> 02:30:19,975
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

1512
02:30:20,255 --> 02:30:24,775
"Call it a streak of insanity."

1513
02:30:24,855 --> 02:30:29,135
"Or the intoxicating effect of love."

1514
02:30:29,592 --> 02:30:34,175
"If this you fail to fathom.."

1515
02:30:34,255 --> 02:30:38,855
"..then only you are to be blamed."

1516
02:30:38,935 --> 02:30:41,992
"Call it a streak of insanity."
