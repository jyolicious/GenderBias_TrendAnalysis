1
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,040 
You want to be paid
but not do your job.

2
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720 
You fear girls? Silly coward!

3
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,040 
Open the door.

4
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,040 
Open the door.

5
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,080 
''Watchman, open the door.''

6
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560 
Where are you running off?

7
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080 
Will you utter a word?

8
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,080 
l had gone to feed your daughter.

9
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760 
l didn't run away in the German war.

10
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760 
But l must run from here.

11
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,360 
You're giving warriors a bad name.

12
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,680 
- Get some more food.
- As you order.

13
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040 
Daddy?

14
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040 
The starvation continues?

15
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640 
What happened to this room?

16
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,640 
A typhoon hit it?

17
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720 
Not yet but it will now.

18
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,520 
How are you?

19
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,520 
Why don't you put me in
chains instead of locking me up?

20
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040 
l'll do it if need be.

21
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040 
You may tie me or do as you wish..

22
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,040 
But l won't eat as long
as you keep me on this boat.

23
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,040 
Don't act like a kid.
Now you're a grown girl.

24
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,080 
And you know finally
my will shall prevail.

25
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080 
Why don't you understand?

26
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,560 
This concerns my life.

27
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,080 
Why should you object to my marriage?

28
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,000 
l object to your choice of
groom... but not to getting married.

29
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,680 
l won't get married if
l can't marry Suman!

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,480 
l'll see to that.

31
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,480 
Come in.

32
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440 
You're back?

33
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360 
Come in and keep the food there.

34
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,440 
- l won't eat!
- Who asked you to?

35
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360 
''l'll eat. Khan, lay the meal.''

36
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,520 
l'm so hungry.

37
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,800 
l feel l haven't eaten for 2 days.

38
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720 
You may leave.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000 
ls that fried lndian bread?

40
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,000 
Rana Pratap loved it.

41
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680 
Roast mutton?

42
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000 
Emperor Akbar loved this.

43
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,480 
You're wielding fork and knife
under the names of the braves.

44
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680 
l won't eat. l'm not hungry.

45
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,480 
Don't eat. Wallow in sorrows.

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040 
That's what one does in love.

47
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040 
l used to eat honey.

48
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,520 
You're joking! My heart is dying.

49
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640 
why don't you understand?

50
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040 
l..l love Suman.

51
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,520 
You love him? For what?

52
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,040 
Because l like him!
He's the country's best pilot.

53
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,040 
He'll take you round in the plane.

54
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,040 
Don't forget he loves
my 70 millions not you.

55
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,080 
You say the same about
any man that loves me.

56
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,000 
Everyone says this
about that rascal.

57
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,000 
l'm not lying but this
must be his third love.

58
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000 
Each time he loves a
millionaire's heiress!

59
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400 
- He never loved anyone!
- Neither does he love anyone now.

60
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,520 
You know nothing!

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,680 
You're being really impudent!

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400 
Get out of my sight!

63
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,440 
Father is asking for you.

64
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040 
''Guard, what are you doing here?''

65
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,040 
Where is baby?

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000 
Don't run around like fools.
Quickly get the boat down.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000 
Captain!!

68
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,360 
- Open the door!
- Open the door to his cabin.

69
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,080 
''My beloved is on the other shore''

70
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080 
''Oh please take me across''

71
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,080 
''Please take me across''

72
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,360 
''My beloved lives far''

73
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,040 
''My beloved lives far''

74
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,720 
''None can guess my feelings''

75
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,040 
''None can guess my feelings''

76
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,040 
''The sea is deep
while l am solitary''

77
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,080 
''l have no support''

78
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720 
''Take me across''

79
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,440 
''My heart dances with the waves''

80
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,080 
''My heart dances with the waves''

81
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,080 
''The face of my beloved
smiles through the waters''

82
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,080 
''The face of my beloved
smiles through the waters''

83
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,040 
''My eyes long to see him''

84
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,040 
''They pine for him.
Somebody take me to him''

85
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,040 
''l am caught between
the sea and my beloved''

86
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,560 
''Take me across the ocean''

87
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,440 
The boat is returning empty.

88
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040 
l don't think they were
able to catch Baby.

89
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640 
l challenge even a plane
can't catch up with my baby!

90
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040 
''After all, she's my daughter.
Do you understand?''

91
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,040 
The girls today are very smart.

92
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,400 
''Not all, only my daughter!''

93
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,520 
But how long will she flee?

94
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040 
She has no money.

95
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,720 
She will have to return.

96
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720 
''You forget, she's
wearing a diamond ring.''

97
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,040 
Diamond ring? Gracious!

98
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,040 
lnform her friends.
Print her picture in the papers!

99
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,080

113
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,040 
Anybody who finds her will
be rewarded with Rs. 150000

114
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,400 
This is Radio Ceylon.

116

''Yes, l am Sagar.''

118
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,640 
''A new writer of your paper,
''Modern World''

119
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480 
You've driven me round the bend!

120
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040 
Every story that you sent
is ordinary and useless!

121
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,640 
l fell sick reading your trash.

122
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,720 
l came to Bangalore for a change
and you won't let me be here too!

123
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,040 
This time the story
that l have is terrific.

124
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,040 
You'll feel great.

125
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,040 
l'll throw it in the dustbin unread!

126
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,400 
''l see, you want to
come here to see me?''

127
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,400 
Go ahead.

00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,560 
- Right away.

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,080 
l'll knock your brains out!

130
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,720 
How do l convince you
that this is a true story?

131
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,520 
Why won't you listen?

132
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,000 
Very well. l'll narrate it there.

133
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,360 
lf it doesn't excite you
l'll give up writing!

134
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,000 
''Mark my words, you'll make
a minimum profit of a million!''

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,680 
l want just Rs. 1000

136
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,680 
Just a thousand?

137
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,000 
Yesterday an astrologer
read my palm and said...

138
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,520 
He saw the blood of a
lousy writer on my hands.

139
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,040 
- Do come over.
- Yes. Don't be angry.

140
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,680 
l'll hang up.

141
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,440

''- Hurry up, mister.
- Shut up!''

144
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,040 
''Excuse me, not you.
A pretty lady outside..''

145
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440 
lll mannered people...not you.

146
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,040 
There's a bus waiting to go
to Bangalore. l'll be there.

147
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600 
Who is this? ls Suman home?

148
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,440 
Not in?

149
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,000 
What? Race..?
He's gone to Bangalore?

150
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,440 
- What's the matter?
- l want to go to Bangalore.

151
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,520 
Take a plane. You'll reach fast.

152
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,520 
Plane...?

153
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,040 
l get it. You have a weak heart.

154
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040 
Doesn't matter.
l have a beautiful idea.

155
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,040 
Take a bus. The fare is real cheap.

156
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,640 
Excellent. Where's the bus stand?

157
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480 
l'll show you.

158
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,320 
''No, just a moment..''

159
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,280 
l'll lose my job if
l take you to the bus stand.

160
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400 
But l'll guide you.

161
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,000 
''Take the right hand,
then the left hand..''

162
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,600 
Take a left from the post colony.

163
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,680 
Turn right from there.
You'll see a cinema...

164
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000 
lt's called Roxy. Then...

165
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400 
Lady...Miss?

166
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,560 
- Take a seat.
- How do l get there?

167
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,720 
- On your feet.
- You're standing in the middle

168
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040 
A bird can't pass through
and l'm a full grown adult.

169
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,560 
Careful..He might choke.

170
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,040 
Mind your own business!

171
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,560 
You speak English?

172
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,720 
Have you bought the ticket? Out.

173
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,040 
what is the meaning of this?
That's my place.

174
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,720 
- Your seat?
- Yes.

175
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480 
''Conductor, do seats have
names of the passengers?''

176
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,480 
No.

177
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,520 
Are these seats measured
that only half a man can sit?

178
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,560 
- Yes.
- No!

179
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,560 
What the...?

180
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,400 
''Next time you wish to travel, get
a fat family member to accompany you.''

181
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560 
Else this pretty nose might break.

182
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,400 
- What is it?
- Letter from Mr. Suman.

183
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,400 
Don't take the wretched man's name!

184
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400 
- Any news of baby?
- No.

185
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080 
Her picture has been
printed in every newspaper.

186
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600 
Her near and dear ones
have been cabled.

187
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,760 
Now it's in God's hands.

188
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,080 
''lf baby isn't found soon,
your pay is in God's hands.''

189
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,760 
''God, help me.''

190
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,080 
Send the reward of a million to me.

191
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,360 
You have no idea of
how bad things are here.

192
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,720 
Tell me how long am l
expected to carry this around?

193
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,560 
''lf you shower me with one
merciful glance, l'll be made!''

194
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040 
- Not like that.
- Then how?

195
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,440 
Like this...

196
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,080 
''The Omnipotent Lord Rama..''

197
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,560 
''Send me a winning lottery
of a million and a quarter''

198
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,080 
''Send me a winning lottery
of a million and a quarter''

199
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,080 
''The Omnipotent Lord Rama..''

200
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,480 
''Send me a winning lottery
of a million and a quarter''

201
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,040 
''Send me a winning lottery
of a million and a quarter''

202
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,040 
''My youth pines for every penny''

203
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,560 
''My youth pines for every penny''

204
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,720 
''l wake up startled''

205
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,400 
''l wake up startled''

206
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080 
''When will l be rid of poverty?''

207
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,080 
''When will l be rid of poverty?''

208
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840 
''The Omnipotent Lord Rama..''

209
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,040 
''Such great news in the papers''

210
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,400 
''Such great news in the papers''

211
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,040 
''The Goddess of wealth
is at our beck and call''

212
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,800 
''The Goddess of wealth
will do our beckoning''

213
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,080 
''We will have a home in the stars''

214
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,480 
''We will have a home in the stars''

215
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,080 
''The Omnipotent Lord Rama..''

216
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,080 
''Send me a winning lottery
of a million and a quarter''

217
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,000 
''Send me a winning lottery
of a million and a quarter''

218
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,360 
''The burden of two
in impoverished times''

219
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,560 
''The burden of two
in impoverished times''

220
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,040 
''We split the few grams''

221
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,040 
''The day of dreams hasn't dawned''

222
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,080 
''The day of dreams hasn't dawned''

223
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,040 
She's sleeping in
comfort and woke me up.

224
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,520 
Get off all...

225
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,760 
Where are we?

226
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,440 
Where are we?

227
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,360 
You're in Heaven and l'm in Hell.

228
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,440 
- What do you mean?
- You slept using me as a pillow...

229
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,040 
...And l stayed awake.

230
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040 
- Pardon me.
- You are excused.

231
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,560 
l've wasted many nights.
So what's another?

232
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,440 
The bus will halt for 30 minutes.

233
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,640 
- Yes?
- Just half an hour?

234
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,720 
- Yes.
- Any objections?

235
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040 
You stay out of this.
Nobody asked you.

236
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,680 
- lf l knew you were so cruel..
- What would you do?

237
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000 
l'd have removed my shoulder
and your pretty nose would break!

238
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,520 
l'm going out. Wait
for me if l'm delayed.

239
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,760 
Yes madam. Travels in a bus
but dreams of airplanes!

240
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,680 
- Conductor. - Yes?
- Wait for me too.

241
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,040 
Wait for me! As if l'm a slave
l'm a conductor not a slave!

242
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040 
Do you hear how they behave?

243
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,040 
l wish God grants my wish.

244
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,040 
And shows me where she is.
l'll have a million in my pocket!

245
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,720 
''Since l married you,
you've only had this dream.''

246
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,000 
But each time l open my eyes
and find we're eating grams.

247
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,400 
Putting me down as if
you brought a big dowry!

248
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600 
Aren't you ashamed to be lying?

249
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,480 
''Named yourself, Bhagwan!''

250
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,320 
You bought this auto with my dowry.

251
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,680 
And we live off it!

252
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600 
Else you'd be dancing!

253
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520 
For now this picture
is dancing in my heart.

254
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000 
where should l look for you?

255
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,520 
l've found her!

256
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,760 
- Come home with me.
- Shameless!

257
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,640 
She saved me the bother by
doing my job. My hand was hurting.

258
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,440 
She's a girl or l'd have
crushed her like an ant!

259
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,040 
Let's go.

260
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,720 
''l say, breakfast is served.''

261
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,520 
Would you like a bite?

262
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,040 
- What is this?
- Corn.

263
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,040 
Don't you know?

264
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,040 
You butt out.
Who asked you?

265
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080 
''- what the..? - You were
looking, my tummy will hurt.''

266
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,760 
Give me one.

267
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,760 
''She will regret it..''

268
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080 
- You be quiet.
- Who's telling you?

269
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080 
''This is maize, corn.''

270
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,080 
''lt is used to make corn soup,
biscuits and pudding. And cake.''

271
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,600 
Also corn bread.

272
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,080 
Don't know? The conductor was right
Dreaming of planes while in a bus.

273
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600 
Eats corn and thinks
of cake and pudding.

274
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,040 
''The princess will repent''

275
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,400 
They are exquisite.
Why have you caged them?

276
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080 
That's my business.
l'll starve if l don't trap them.

277
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,680 
How much will you
charge for all of them?

278
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400 
- Rs. 10.
- Only 10?

279
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,680 
Here's 20.

280
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080 
May God grant you happiness.

281
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,520 
''l soar in the skies
like a free bird''

282
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,760 
''l have been liberated today''

283
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,800 
''l soar in the skies
like a free bird''

284
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,040 
''l have been liberated today''

285
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,600 
''Morning glows in my life''

286
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,080 
''The dark clouds
have been cast aside''

287
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,040 
''When the cuckoo sings
amid the lush fields..''

288
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040 
''My heart sings in gay abandonment''

289
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,640 
''Spring fills my life with colour''

290
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,040 
''l soar in the skies
like a free bird''

291
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,040 
''l have been liberated today''

292
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,760 
''l wish to play with the seasons''

293
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,080 
''l want to play with
the flow of the river''

294
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,440 
''l want to play with the sun,
the moon and the stars''

295
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,040 
''Envelop the sky in my arms''

296
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,040 
''Singing and proceeding
in my own world of thoughts''

297
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,000 
''Wrap the clouds
around me like a scarf''

298
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,040 
''Lightning adorns my feet''

299
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,520 
''Stealing the darkness
of the clouds..''

300
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,720 
''My life follows the
turbulence of the river''

301
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,040 
''Cool waves rise from my heart''

302
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,680 
Pass me the blue bag.

303
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,000 
There's also a black briefcase.

304
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,560 
The bus left?

305
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,640 
The poor bus was helpless.

306
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,400 
- The driver took her away.
- He was very bad.

307
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,000 
l'd prohibited him from
leaving till l came.

308
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,480 
''You're absolutely right, my princess.''

309
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,000 
How dare that slave disobey you!

310
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000 
Actually he didn't understand.
Thought you were a queen of cards.

311
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,680 
Thank you.

312
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,000 
But why did you stay back?

313
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,360 
- Thought l'd be of help to you.
- l'm not a child!

314
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,680 
Your actions demonstrate that
you've just hatched out of an egg.

315
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,520 
l don't tolerate insolence.

316
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,000 
What do you think of me?

317
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,000 
l think well.

318
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,040 
Wish you too could understand yourself

319
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,480 
This appears to be my picture.

320
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,040 
''No, that's my picture.''

321
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,040 
My father's name is Girdharilal.

322
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,040 
And l've eloped to marry Suman.

323
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,040 
The man who takes me home
will be rewarded with 150000

324
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040 
So you're here for the reward?

325
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,720 
''Don't worry. Keep mum, l'll
give you the address at Bangalore.''

326
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,400 
Collect the reward there.

327
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,000 
You probably never heard
of mankind and helping nature.

328
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,640 
You measure everything in money.

329
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000 
''Yes, even humans.''

330
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,000 
You are only animals
trapped in the cage of life!

331
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,000 
And you only buy animals!

332
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,040 
''Mr. Mankind, now what?''

333
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,640 
l guarantee that you are
a gentleman and very respectable.

334
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,520 
Say something to me.

335
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720 
Strange mankind...

336
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,520 
Doesn't answer back.

337
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040 
''ld you won't speak, stand
with your kind and shoo crows.''

338
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040 
This lamb is more human than men.

339
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,720 
She answered me in her own way.

340
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,040 
Humans understand human language
and animals understand animals.

341
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080 
My dear lamb...

342
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720 
Can you tell me when
the next bus will arrive?

343
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,080 
''She says, very soon.''

344
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,760 
''Dear lamb, teach the good
lady some lndian manners.''

345
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,760 
Tell her to obey elders.
Her Daddy is right.

346
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760 
Suman is not a good guy.

347
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080 
- He's marrying her for money.
- Be quiet.

348
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,080 
l don't need your advice.

349
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,680 
The girl is one strange beast!

350
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,440 
''Pleads when you're angry,
talk lovingly and she'll snap!''

351
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440 
A good dance is priceless.

352
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,040 
Makes one forget the world.

353
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,040 
Your love too is priceless.

354
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,400 
Girdharilal's daughter ran
away from home for your love.

355
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,320 
And you're having a ball here.

356
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,800 
That's not new.

357
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,080 
This is the third girl
who has fallen for me.

358
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,000 
But Girdharilal is quite stubborn.

359
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,000 
This time you're playing with fire.

360
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,400 
To acquire 70 crores
one has to take risks.

361
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,440 
Once l lay my hands on his wealth
everything will be at my feet.

362
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,520 
The lines of
Air lndia lnternational..

363
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,000 
..will stand by for us
to go on world tours.

364
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,440 
Every country will call out..

365
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,680 
''Where are you, Kumar Suman?''

366
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,440 
Come here once.

367
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,440 
What will happen if
the opposite comes true?

368
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,360 
l won't kill me.

369
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,040 
l'll find another girl.

370
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,360 
Life is fleeting.
Some girl will be mien.

371
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,680 
This is right.
That too is done.

372
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,520 
Got this too!

373
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,000 
What rhymes!

374
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000 
The heart is swinging

375
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,000 
''Come close, don't torment me.''

376
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,000 
''Going? Stop, listen to this.''

377
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,040 
l was saying...
nothing. l said nothing.

378
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040 
What poetry l've composed!

379
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,040 
l wondered why the
poems slipped out

380
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,520 
l had no idea the best
poem was next to me.

381
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,040 
''Madam, in Urdu
l'm called a bard.''

382
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,520 
And a poet in English.

383
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,440 
What about you?

384
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,640 
Your silence answered me well.

385
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,480 
You need no introduction.

386
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,640 
l've just composed a poem.
l'll recite it for you.

387
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000 
You glanced away and now
you don't recognise me.

388
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,000 
And she looks at me
as if she knows nothing.

389
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000 
l don't think you liked the poem

390
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,680 
''l swear by you,
l can write any form.''

391
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,480 
Try this one.
l smile through my pain.

392
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,680 
Tears fill my eyes
but l do not cry.

393
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,040 
l am tormented all night
so l can't sleep a wink.

394
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,440 
How was that?

395
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,360 
ls silence a new way of appreciation?

396
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,040 
l have become her admirer.

397
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040 
l've written a poem for her.

398
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,040 
My heart is on fire
with the poems emerging.

399
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,040 
l fear the bus might catch fire.

400
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,040 
l'll douse the fire.

401
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,640 
My name is Sagar (ocean)
Get up from here.

402
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000 
- Why? - One punch on the
head will answer your queries.

403
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000 
That's my wife you're flirting with!

404
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,600 
- Your wife...?
- Yes.

405
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,600 
Poems ruined...

406
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,480 
Get up fast or your
name will be mud!

407
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000 
l left your home without dignity.

408
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,520 
Seems to be a useless poet.

409
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,000 
l thank you for intervening.

410
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,040 
Don't fly high. l came here
feeling sorry for the poor guy.

411
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,360 
A good poet looked crazy
sitting beside you.

412
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,640 
The News..

413
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040 
''News of the day,
Reward of Rs. 150000''

414
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,560 
Millionaire heiress runs away.

415
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,080 
''Constable, what's the matter?''

416
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,400 
The bridge is being repaired.
The bus can't go till it's done.

417
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080 
''Excuse me, constable...''

418
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,560 
- How long will this take?
- Maybe a whole night.

419
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,080 
- Maybe even 10 nights.
- 10 nights!

420
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,080 
ls there an inn close by?

421
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,760 
Right ahead.

422
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,600 
Banwarilal runs it but
only gives rooms to couples.

423
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,600 
Who is alone?

424
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,480 
l'll just get back.

425
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,720 
Sitting all alone?
Where's your husband?

426
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,040 
You're back to chew my brains!
Should l call him?

427
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,480 
- Sure and l'll call the cops.

428
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,560 
''Yes, take a look...''

429
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,560 
Here..

430
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,720 
Uttering the truth in love
gives one a good name.

431
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,080 
But the time has come
that one gets rewarded.

432
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,080 
Reward of 125000
How is the poem?

433
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,480 
He's back.

434
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,480 
Mind the head.

435
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,760 
''Pretty lady, the bus
won't go any further.''

436
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,600 
We'll have to stay in the inn.

437
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,600 
''Driver, please give our bags.''

438
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,080 
Come along.

439
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,520 
Do you know the poet knows all?

440
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,520 
He just showed me the paper.

441
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,440 
ls that so?

442
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,560 
You seem to be a confirmed poet.

443
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,040 
By your kind grace
l'm writing for 20 years.

444
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,040 
l just composed a poem.
Pay attention..

445
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,640 
Actually one earns a name in love.

446
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,400 
Why are you staring at your palm?

447
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,480 
The hand...?

448
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,800 
''Not the palm, l'm reading my lines.''

449
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,680 
l was checking how many
poets l'm going to murder.

450
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,560 
Killed 3 already.

451
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,760 
You make it sound as if
you slaughtered 2 chickens.

452
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,480 
What's your profession?

453
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,480 
l'm a dacoit.

454
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,600 
Dacoit... What?
Did you mean dacoit?

455
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,080 
- How many kids do you have?
- l'll tell you.

456
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,080 
Poets always have many kids.
5 + 4 = 9...

457
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,520 
Why do you ask?

458
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040 
l'll eliminate the complete family.

459
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,520 
Hear my name!

460
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,520 
- Now do you follow?
- Yes!

461
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,720 
The dacoit who freezes
everyone's blood?

462
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,040 
l'd heard of you.
Finally l get to see you

463
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,640 
Look into my eyes like a man!

464
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,040 
But l've turned blind.
l can see nothing.

465
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,040 
l'll fire the pistol.
See your face in its' flare.

466
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,480 
Don't bother. l'm leaving
Please excuse me.

467
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,040 
You must apologise with the family.

468
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,720 
We'll apologise 10 times
but first let me fetch them.

469
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,480 
And the paper?

470
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,520 
That's my death warrant.
l'll tear it up. Here...

471
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,800 
lf you mention it to anyone..

472
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,080 
Am l an ass? l value
my life and my kids.

473
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,080 
And l value the girl.

474
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,080 
l'm whisking her away.

475
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,600 
Do take her away.

476
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,040 
''lf you please, l'll
compose a couplet for you.''

477
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,520 
Wonderful.

478
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,720 
He was troubling me for ages.
How did you get rid of the pest?

479
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,440 
Just used my head.

480
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,480 
lf l praise you any more
it will go to your head.

481
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,040 
Yes. Where's the inn?

482
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,560 
Don't you have eyes?
lt's right in front.

483
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,080 
l understand. But
l don't trust you.

484
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,080 
Why do you need separate
rooms if you are married?

485
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,400 
Separate...?

486
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,360 
We fought in the bus.

487
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,600 
Don't be childish.

488
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,440 
This fight will never end
if you live in separate rooms.

489
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,040 
- Choose your room.
- We want to be separate.

490
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,040 
- Find another place.
- There's no other place.

491
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,520 
l have lots of work.
Don't bother me.

492
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,040 
- All right.
- Pay me 5 bucks.

493
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,720 
Which rooms have we got?

494
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,440 
We've got just one room.

495
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,560 
l won't live with you.

496
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,040 
- Then stay outside.
- Have you no shame?

497
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,560 
l have more shame than you.

498
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,080 
But my hands are tied.
He gives rooms only to couples.

499
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,400 
''And if you're married,
you only get one room.''

500
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,560 
Did you tell him we're a couple?

501
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,680 
l was forced to say it.

502
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,000 
l wouldn't want you as my wife.

503
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,000 
l won't stay in this room!

504
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,440 
l'm not begging you.

505
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,080 
who is that?

506
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,520 
You...?

507
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,000 
What are you doing in the dark?

508
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,000 
- Nothing.
- Good God!

509
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,360 
This is so bad.
A couple always argues.

510
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,360 
Now go to your room.

511
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,680 
Pardon? No thanks.

512
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,680 
Go in. lt's going to pour.

513
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,520 
Huge snakes inhabit this place.

514
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,480 
So be it.

515
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,040 
Good girls don't stand
out all alone in the dark.

516
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,520 
what will people say?

517
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,040 
l can be very firm.

518
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,040 
Go to your room quietly
Or l'll have to drag you.

519
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,040 
Go on.

520
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,000 
These foolish husbands of today
pamper their wives and spoil them.

521
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000 
- l beg your pardon!
- Go on.

522
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,520 
Who is it?

523
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,000 
Open the door.

524
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,000 
Who is it?

525
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,520 
You're a strange husband. Left
your wife alone when it's raining.

526
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,640 
l talked to her but she won't listen.

527
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,040 
Then slap her into submission.

528
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,040 
That's what l'll have to do.

529
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,520 
- Go in.
- Come in.

530
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,040 
The girl's parents
seem to have spoilt her.

531
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,040 
That is true.

532
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,520 
What are you standing for?
Shut the door.

533
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040 
- The door..
- Shut the door!

534
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000 
''Don't be scared, pretty lady.''

535
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,440 
Look at this.

536
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000 
This is your room
and that is mine.

537
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,000 
l won't stay here!

538
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,440 
What do you think?

539
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000 
l want to assure you that l'm
not after your wealth or beauty.

540
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,000 
l hanker after only one thing.
That is a lovely story.

541
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,360 
l get it printed and
become famous nation-wide

542
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,000 
Are you the editor of a paper?

543
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,800 
''No, l'm a writer.''

544
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,680 
You want my story?
Then l won't stay here!

545
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,360 
l'll jump off this wall!

546
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,360 
Sure. At the worst
you'll break your leg.

547
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,040 
The only change will be my story
will be titled pretty cripple.

548
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,040 
Look at your face.
You look raging mad.

549
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,800 
- Have mercy on yourself.
- Thanks for your sympathy.

550
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,560 
Take my advice and return home.

551
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,440 
The one you're doing this
for is not worth it..

552
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,400 
- Who are you to say this?
- l'm a reporter who knows all.

553
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,720 
l know what kind
of a man Suman is.

554
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,040 
Mohanlal's daughter before you.

555
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,080 
Then Rai Bahadur's niece
Now he's after you.

556
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,080 
Have you no shame
accusing an innocent man?

557
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,400 
lt's my life.
l'll do as l please.

558
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,080 
You're nobody to advise me.

559
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,560 
You are blinded by him.

560
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,760 
Mark my words when you get a blow.

561
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,080 
l'm going to think about my story.
You do as you please.

562
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,720 
''The night is drenched,
the scene picturesque''

563
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,080 
''Gently the moon rose in the sky''

564
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,480 
''The night is drenched,
the scene picturesque''

565
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,600 
''Gently the moon rose in the sky''

566
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,600 
''Why is the moonlight enigmatic
after inciting a fire in me?''

567
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,040 
''The surroundings won't let me sleep''

568
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,040 
''The wafting breeze,
the vain turquoise sky''

569
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,720 
''The blush of innocence on the buds''

570
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:38,080 
''ln such a mood why is
the heart on edge?''

571
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:43,080 
''What is life lacking?''

572
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,080 
''Why is the moonlight enigmatic
after inciting a fire in me?''

573
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,760 
''The surroundings won't let me sleep''

574
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,600 
''The night is drenched,
the scene picturesque''

575
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:04,520 
''Gently the moon rose in the sky''

576
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:25,040 
''The mind searches for the dream
that can't be mine in the daylight''

577
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,560 
''ln the night engulfed
by the glittering sky...''

578
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,520 
''l search for my beloved''

579
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,520 
''The night is drenched,
the scene picturesque''

580
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:49,080 
''Gently the moon rose in the sky''

581
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:55,080 
''Why is the moonlight enigmatic
after inciting a fire in me?''

582
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,520 
''The surroundings won't let me sleep''

583
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:21,040 
''lsn't there anyone in the world..''

584
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:26,040 
''who would accidentally miss me''

585
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,560 
''A slight smile on his lips..''

586
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,040 
''...would lit up my world''

587
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:35,040 
''l swear by your mountain
heap, my precious poem..''

588
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,040 
l was returning from a poetry
recital when l bumped into a dacoit.

589
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,040 
Good grief! Then..?

590
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,040 
Our combat continued for 7 hours.

591
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,720 
The way we fought...
the fencing with swords...

592
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,040 
Will you stop at this
exciting point or carry on?

593
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,720 
Nothing much to add.
We were equal opponents.

594
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,520 
- Would l have given up?
- But...

595
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,080 
Yes poetry gives me an edge.

596
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:04,520 
l picked up a stone.
And recited a lovely couplet.

597
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,000 
l just had to read it and
the stone turned to an atom bomb!

598
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,520 
''Then l said, where are you
going you son of a gun?''

599
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,680 
Your teeth are still intact.

600
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,000 
''- He said, l'll kill your kids!
- Our kids?''

601
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,400 
l threw him a challenge
l bet my world...

602
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:30,040 
''He said, one day
l'll avenge this.''

603
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,640 
''l answered, l'll break your nose.''

604
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,520 
What a nuisance!

605
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,640 
What do you want?

606
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,720 
l want you to apologise
to him with our family.

607
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,040 
Only then will l be at peace.

608
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,560 
- Can't trust dacoits.
- That's right.

609
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,720 
- Should l apologise? Yes?
- Of course.

610
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:02,000 
l told you there's nobody here
except for a young couple.

611
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,400 
How is the girl?

612
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,400 
l consider it bad taste
to stare at young girls.

613
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,000 
Every man is not an ass like you!

614
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,520 
Not every man is an ass but
neither is he as young as me.

615
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,360 
Do you think l'm old?

616
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,000 
With one blow l'll
crack your skull in 4!

617
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,000 
''Excuse me, we're decent folk.
We don't believe in fights.''

618
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,040 
Talk to us.

619
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,520 
We suspect this girl has
been forced to run away.

620
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,040 
We want to be assured.

621
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,040 
l said they are a couple!

622
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,440 
- Have you seen proof of
their marriage? - Have you?

623
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,520 
- No. - Then how can you say
that they are a married couple?

624
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,040 
Go to the city and you'll find out..

625
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,040 
Girls and boys move around
as if they are married.

626
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:02,640 
ls that so? What strange times!

627
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,640 
Our ancestors made fools of us.

628
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000 
Good gracious!
Come with me.

629
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000 
''Pretty lady, get up fast.''

630
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,360 
- What..? Let me sleep.
- Let me sleep!

631
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,440 
- Misfortune has befallen.
- Let it.

632
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000 
- Heard that sound?
- Don't want to hear.

633
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000 
Somebody has come
this far in your search.

634
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,360 
Go back to sleep.

635
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,520 
Please come in.

636
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,680 
''Dear wife, some people
are here to meet us.''

637
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,680 
She's changing.

638
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,040 
l won't come out! Husbands
don't care about their wives.

639
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,040 
l'm tired since 3 nights.

640
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,040 
You will have to come! lt's your
husband's not your father's house!

641
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,720 
- l'll go back to him then.
- Sure. l'm not holding you back.

642
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,640 
l'll leave right now.

643
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,040 
- l won't ever return.
- Don't. l'll marry another.

644
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,040 
Don't mess with me.
l'll send you to jail!

645
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,040 
You'll send me to jail!
l'll show you!

646
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,040 
Have you no shame?

647
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,040 
ls this what your parents taught you?

648
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,720 
Do you see...
they're fighting again.

649
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,080 
Do you agree they are married?

650
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,680 
This rascal gets
thrashed every morning!

651
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:30,760 
''Yesterday morning, a girl hit him
Today he'll get thrashed here.''

652
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,080 
Crying? You should have
thought of this before!

653
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,080 
What's the point in crying now?

654
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,520 
Stop beating me!

655
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,120 
- Stop them fighting.
- You started it.

656
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,040 
Why are you sending her?

657
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,720 
- l feel shy.
- Hurry up!

658
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,520 
l'm going. Don't beat me.

659
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,480 
May l come in?

660
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,080 
what do you want? Get out!

661
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,080 
- Where's your wife?
- None of your business!

662
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,560 
- l want to apologize.
- For what?

663
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,080 
- Apologise..
- l see.

664
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,560 
Don't apologise. We
husbands have to suffer.

665
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,760 
You're..absolutely right!

666
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,080 
Slog all day and return
home to be bashed up.

667
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080 
The fingers must leave quite
an imprint of these chubby cheeks.

668
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,440 
l swear l never ever shave.

669
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,760 
Every morning l get a close
shave by her delicate fingers.

670
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:04,440 
Didn't get the quota today?

671
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,720 
''Yes, l got bashed in the morning
This is the second helping.''

672
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,040 
What a cowardly time.

673
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,040 
The wife has the upper hand
and the husband gets thrashed.

674
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,040 
Good grief.

675
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,720 
- What does this mean
- why did you hit me?

676
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,520 
''- First you hit me
- No, you did. - Shut up!''

677
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,560 
lt's true your parents
have spoilt you!

678
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,480 
- l'll check the bus.
- l'm coming along!

679
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,080 
l'm not one of those who
ties his wife to his apron!

680
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,080 
- l'm not your wife!
- You will be somebody's!

681
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,800 
God help him!

682
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,640 
Have you no shame addressing
other's fathers as Daddy?

683
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,680 
You will be my Dad in some time.

684
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,760 
- Any news of baby?
- No!

685
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,040 
''- That's sad.
- No, it's good news.''

686
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,040 
She's safe from a monkey like you.

687
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,720 
lnnumerable girls love this face.

688
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,040 
Really? The girls of today are blind

689
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,040 
The fall for faces.

690
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,440 
They'll greet you with shoes
when they discover your nature.

691
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,080 
l'm not one of those.
Why don't you try to understand?

692
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,040 
Your wealth and my fame
can turn the world around.

693
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:43,080 
''lf you are so famous, turn the
world around without money.''

694
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080 
Because fame alone can't do it.

695
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,800 
''Whether you turn the world over
or not, you'll turned my world.''

696
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:57,080 
''But if you mess with me, be warned
you're asking for trouble.''

697
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,080 
Why don't you compromise?

698
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,040 
You should know you're going to lose.

699
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,000 
l'm one of those who
fights to the last breath.

700
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,680 
All my life l'll fight to
see baby doesn't marry you!

701
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,680 
And if you don't succeed..?

702
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,640 
My bad luck.

703
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,640 
Has she gone?
She has left.

704
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,040 
Let her go! Who cares?

705
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,560 
Will l pine for her?

706
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,800 
Will l pine for you?

707
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,080 
l regret after the deed is done.

708
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,080 
Where had you vanished?

709
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,360 
''l asked, where you had gone.''

710
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,080 
- To get saris.
- Saris?

711
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,600 
Women can be strange!

712
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,360 
They'll starve but they must
shop. How much money is left?

713
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,520 
Re. 1 and 2 annas.

714
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,000 
Enjoy yourself. We can't
survive another 5 days.

715
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,000 
Where will we stay? On air?
You spent all the money.

716
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:15,520 
- Don't you have any money?
- l left it in the Baghdad Bank.

717
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,440 
Money or camels?

718
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,040 
Don't crack jokes. Lift your
bag and let's foot it out.

719
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,440 
- So far? - Yes.
- What will we eat?

720
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:29,520 
Silken saris.

721
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,520 
Mister humankind.

722
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,560 
''Yes, pretty nuisance?''

723
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:48,480 
- What's your name?
- Why do you care?

724
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,080 
Please..

725
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,560 
Really? ls that your real name?

726
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,560 
- Meaning the ocean?
- Yes. do you mind?

727
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,520 
l don't see any signs
of water of storm.

728
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,520 
l just see dust flowing.

729
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,400 
Every place is wilderness
for those blinded by love.

730
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,680 
The rest of the life
they won't see each other.

731
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,000 
- Why do you talk to me like this?
- Because you are younger.

732
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,040 
l too will use the same tone.

733
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,040 
- You will talk with respect.
- No! No!

734
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,520 
Mr. mankind?

735
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,040 
Your family is calling out to you.

736
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,560 
Mr. Mankind...listen...

737
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,440 
l'm starving. Get some food.

738
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,040 
You are eating.
What else do you want?

739
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,560 
But...this is corn.

740
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,040 
We should have something better.

741
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,400 
What could be better than this?
lt feeds millions.

742
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,560 
As for taste..

743
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,400 
Eat it.

744
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000 
So much? Why do you bother?

745
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000 
l'm exhausted. l can't walk any more.

746
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,440 
There's a village in front. Cross
the drain and cable your father.

747
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,360 
He'll send a palanquin
for his darling daughter.

748
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,040 
That's impossible.

749
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,040 
Then keep walking.

750
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,040 
l'm extremely tired.

751
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,440 
Already tired?

752
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,040 
The poor villagers
walk 50 miles every day.

753
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,760 
Now you know what poverty is

754
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,480 
''Yes, and l love it.''

755
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,760 
- Then why are you crying?
- Can't help my looks.

756
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,560 
Let me rest for awhile

757
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,560 
You're talking to me quite informally

758
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,600 
''Hurry up, it's turning dark
We must get across.''

759
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000 
Have your relatives
built a bungalow there?

760
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,520 
''- Will we stay there?
- No, your Pop has a palace.''

761
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,680 
Mind your tongue.

762
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,000 
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

763
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,000 
- lf you don't obey me..
- What will you do?

764
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,440 
Let go! l don't approve of this!

765
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,000 
''You follow me everywhere''

766
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000 
''With silken feet,
you sneak into my heart''

767
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,720 
''Tell me what you mean to me''

768
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,520 
''You follow me everywhere''

769
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,760 
''With silken feet,
you sneak into my heart''

770
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000 
''Tell me who you are''

771
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:37,040 
''This is a bond of hearts''

772
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,040 
''On the path of love
in quest of love''

773
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,040 
''Don't ask me how
l am related to you''

774
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,800 
''l will raise a hue and cry''

775
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,040 
''Create a scene''

776
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,080 
''l will raise a hue and cry''

777
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,080 
''l'll tell the world about you''

778
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,560 
''l'll tell the world about you''

779
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,080 
''Go away from my door step''

780
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,680 
''Stay away from my heart''

781
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,080 
''Tell me who you are''

782
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,720 
''What wrong have l done?''

783
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,040 
''What wrong have l done?''

784
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,040 
''What wrong have l done?''

785
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,560 
''l gave you my heart
and asked for yours''

786
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,720 
''l gave you my heart
and asked for yours''

787
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,040 
''Call some wise men''

788
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,480 
''l want a decision now''

789
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:33,080 
''Don't ask me what l mean to you''

790
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,760 
''When the hearts are in love..''

791
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,440 
''We are in love''

792
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:06,040 
''When the hearts are in love..''

793
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,040 
''Who will obey us?''

794
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,400 
''Who will obey us?''

795
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,040 
''You follow me around''

796
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,040 
''Gently sneaking into my heart''

797
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:34,080 
''Don't ask me what l mean to you''

798
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,560 
Must have been a terrible
moment when l bumped into you.

799
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,560 
Where did you go
leaving me all alone?

800
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,080 
l could have died of fright.

801
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,560 
l went to arrange so that
you don't die of hunger.

802
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,560 
See how hard my heart is beating.

803
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,120 
First tell me if you're
more hungry or frightened.

804
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,200 
Now l'm neither hungry nor scared.

805
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,040 
''All line clear''

806
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,040 
''All line clear''

807
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,040 
''Let the train advance''

808
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,400 
''This is my own train with
a cannonball so no fears''

809
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,040 
''All line clear''

810
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,480 
''Never missed the target''

811
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,520 
''Nobody is a match for us''

812
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,680 
''Never missed the target''

813
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,360 
''Nobody is a match for us''

814
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:43,040 
''Ultimately the world had
to bow its' head to me''

815
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,000 
''We're going along singing''

816
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,760 
''Don't ask where
our hearts are burning''

817
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,000 
''We're going along singing''

818
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,440 
''Don't ask where
our hearts are burning''

819
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,040 
''Place us in your hearts''

820
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,040 
''We are worthy of love''

821
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,440 
- What's wrong?
- Why are you going to the woods?

822
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,040 
Why don't you take the straight road?

823
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,720 
- Do you know what's here?
- What?

824
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,440 
Two graves.

825
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,040 
- Where?
- There.

826
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,040 
All your wishes are granted.

827
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,040 
- Really?
- Yes.

828
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,560 
My parents couldn't have a kid..

829
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,560 
How did you take birth?

830
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,720 
They came here and asked
for a boon and l was born.

831
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,560 
What a terrible thing to ask for.

832
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:18,560 
My life wouldn't have been
ruined if you didn't take birth.

833
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:25,400 
''lf not for me, you'd wander
around without a husband!''

834
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,080 
Talk with respect.
The graves are nearby.

835
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,080 
So they are.

836
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,600 
Take off your shoes first.

837
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,560 
Somebody might steal them.

838
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,760 
Spirits that mend matters...

839
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,760 
And sleep in sweet slumber

840
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,080 
- Pray that we find the girl
- And win the reward of 125000

841
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,440 
- We'll offer you sweets worth
- Rs. 5000.

842
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,080 
- We'll be broke if it comes true.
- You're a miser.

843
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,080 
l'll distribute sweets worth 10000.

844
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,440 
''lf you carry on, you'll see
3 graves there instead of 2''

845
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,040 
''Not now, might...''

846
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,480 
''Okay, let's go closer.''

847
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,080 
Somebody stole the
soil of the graves.

848
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,040 
- What nonsense!
- l'm right.

849
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,040 
The graves are now smaller.
Somebody is making a new home.

850
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,560 
What do you want?

851
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,720 
Did you see that?
Shall we sit down?

852
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,400 
Our prayers have been accepted.
Ask what you desire.

853
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,400 
- You know the girl..
- l know everything.

854
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,800 
''You're out in search of
Girdharilal's daughter, Kammo.''

855
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,080 
- For a reward of 125000
- Yes sir!

856
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:57,080 
You're at the wrong place.

857
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,600 
You won't find her here.

858
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,080 
lf you want your
wish to be fulfilled...

859
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,680 
Take the advice of a wise man
and run away from here fast.

860
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,520 
Or the girl will escape.

861
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,520 
''l say, get away fast.''

862
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,560 
Take the wise man's advice.

863
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,760 
lt comes from the heavens.

864
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,560 
My reward of 125000.

865
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,200 
''Great work, man!''

866
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,640 
Shall we call the cops or
will you quietly come home?

867
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,240 
Go away or l'll teach you
a lesson you'll never forget.

868
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:34,240 
- Others might be scared..
- Let go of my hand!

869
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,720 
Let go or you'll regret it!

870
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,880 
Look after yourself!

871
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240 
What nonsense!
Stop your wife!

872
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,240 
l won't. l'm enjoying this.

873
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,240 
l warn you. She's got
a terrible temper!

874
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,960 
Listen. For 4 years
l'm waiting for a chance.

875
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,240 
Let her beat up my wife
for at least 4 hours.

876
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,760 
Good...

877
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:04,240 
Great! Terrific!

878
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,760 
Give up or l'll beat your brains out!

879
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,280 
Get lost! l know girls like you!

880
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,200 
She's good!

881
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,920 
Why are you stopping them?

882
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,840 
Come on. Sultan!

883
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,760 
She's the wrong one.
Hold the lower one.

884
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,240 
Everyone beat her.

885
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,240 
Attack!

886
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,720 
Why are you beating me?

887
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,200 
Sit down.
Your cap.

888
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200 
- Thanks.
- Have you forgiven me?

889
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,200 
l'm serving you.

890
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,560 
Now l'll have to write
a poem in your honour.

891
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,200 
- No complaints..
- Quietly slink away.

892
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,320 
Holy smoke...
another nuisance.

893
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,120 
- What's up?
- No fuel.

894
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:21,120 
Come on.

895
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,160 
An unforeseen problem each time.

896
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,400 
Now what?

897
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,160 
l'm tired.

898
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,400 
Don't worry. Bangalore
is just 7 miles away.

899
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,160 
7 miles?

900
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,160 
Seven miles?

901
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,160 
But we just left Madras.

902
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,160 
Who can hold time?

903
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,080 
''Yes, it's a matter of time.''

904
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,080 
l wished to fly to Bangalore.

905
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,680 
Now that Bangalore is close...

906
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,440 
...my feet are trembling.

907
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,680 
That happens when you're
close to the destination.

908
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,360 
l don't think so.

909
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,720 
l feel l'm leaving my right
destination and advancing alone.

910
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,440 
Look there..

911
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:29,720 
We're at a cross road.

912
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,720 
One goes to a poor village.

913
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,720 
The other to the wealthy
city of Bangalore.

914
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,400 
l've loved the simple
life of the village.

915
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,400 
that the glitter of the
city holds no attraction.

916
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,040 
Woman is the oar of life.

917
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:47,200 
The boat can't move without her.

918
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:52,720 
The oar is useless unless a man's
strong arms help combat the storm.

919
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,200 
Then combat it.

920
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,240 
Careful...

921
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,400 
''- Sorry, it took off...
- You're not at fault.''

922
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:27,240 
l was born at the wrong time.
Who are you?

923
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,080 
We....are travellers.

924
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,440 
We want to stay here.

925
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,080 
l was born at the right time.
How long will you stay?

926
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,280 
- 3 or 4 days.
- 3 or 4 days!

927
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,760 
Who is it?

928
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,760 
- Who is she?
- Can't you guess?

929
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,760 
Appears to be his wife.

930
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,760 
- Yes? - Your wife? - Yes.

931
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,440 
They are travellers.
Want to stay with us.

932
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,440 
But who the heck are they?

933
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,800 
Softly. Must be a couple.

934
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,400 
l don't want anybody
staying in our home.

935
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,520 
Look at the face.
She looks like a nuisance.

936
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,720 
Don't malign womanhood.

937
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:13,400 
Shut your mouth or l'll knock
out some more of your teeth.

938
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,280 
Square up the account of teeth later.

939
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,760 
First be kind enough
to show us to our room.

940
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,120 
First be kind enough
to show us the money.

941
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,160 
We'll pay you the day
we vacate the room.

942
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,800 
And if you don't trust us
we're leaving. Come on.

943
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:30,440 
They seem so suspicious.

944
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,280 
- No sir..
- We thought we'd stay awhile.

945
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,400 
We'd leave a tip of Rs. 50
But they've got bad luck

946
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:41,040 
What are you doing? This place
is turning into an orphanage.

947
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,200 
Your aunts are all over the place.

948
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,720 
''Move aside. Sir,
l'll show you the room.''

949
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:49,720 
First arrange some food.

950
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,120 
- Yes.
- He's starving.

951
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:55,720 
- Butter with the meal.
- Absolutely sir.

952
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,720 
Son of sir...

953
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,240 
l'll show the room.
You cook for them.

954
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,760 
- Listen..
- Yes?

955
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,760 
- Do we have flour?
- Make bread of cereal.

956
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,240 
Don't beat me in public.

957
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,760 
''- Hurry. Dinner growing cold.
- Go ahead, my plate is coming.''

958
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,760 
- There's no other plate.
- No...why?

959
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,440 
How can two eat in one plate?

960
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,760 
Mr. Madarilal!

961
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:34,720 
They follow the custom of
a couple eating together.

962
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,720 
A couple....

963
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,040 
Today we eat together.

964
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,480 
When we meet in the future
you might not recognise me.

965
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:57,080 
Who can say who will
not recognise the other?

966
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,760 
''There, our false wall is up.''

967
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,240 
What a life we're leading.

968
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,240 
Everything is false.

969
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:31,760 
The relationship is false.

970
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,720 
The husband is false.
So is the wife.

971
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,720 
What's wrong?

972
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,200 
What's wrong?

973
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,720 
There's nobody here.

974
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,720 
What are you thinking of?

975
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,120 
Nothing.

976
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,000 
l thought your Suman was here
hence you're not listening to me.

977
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,720 
l was thinking of tomorrow.

978
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,720 
Tomorrow will be great.

979
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:11,720 
Tomorrow you'll be
with Suman in Bangalore.

980
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:14,320 
The hearts will be one again.

981
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,160 
ls that what you were thinking?

982
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,160 
l was thinking of those who
will be separated tomorrow.

983
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,480 
Don't feel sorry for those
who have to be separated.

984
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,240 
Won't you feel any sorrow?

985
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,240 
Sorrow is a weakness.
l don't like being weak.

986
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:03,120 
''Let's dance in the moonlight
the forest will come to life''

987
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:07,120 
''The sky will twinkle with joy''

988
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,720 
''The sky will twinkle with joy''

989
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,720 
''My heart says and dances...''

990
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:20,240 
''My beloved, take me
across the stars''

991
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,080 
''l am lonely here''

992
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,760 
''l am lonely here''

993
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,120 
''ln this drenched night..''

994
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,720 
''Hold on to your heart''

995
01:36:55,720 --> 01:37:02,120 
''Every breath calls out your name''

996
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:07,720 
''The rays of the moon
advise you to fall in love''

997
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,720 
''Life is a journey,
where do we go tomorrow?''

998
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:18,240 
''The rays of the moon
advise you to fall in love''

999
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,480 
''Life is a journey,
where do we go tomorrow?''

1000
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:34,360 
''Let's dance in the moonlight
the forest will come to life''

1001
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:28,720 
''l wish l could turn into
a cloud and glide away''

1002
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:37,160 
''l would bring the sky shimmering
like a bride down to earth''

1003
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,280 
''The moon would glitter
the stars would sparkle''

1004
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:46,680 
''The world would be joyous
because two hearts would be one''

1005
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:53,040 
''The moon would glitter
the stars would sparkle''

1006
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,200 
''The world would be joyous
because two hearts would be one''

1007
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,240 
Sometimes one gets to
that stage in love...

1008
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,440 
You can predict what
will happen before it does.

1009
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,160 
lt can be felt.

1010
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,480 
Do you know what it is called?

1011
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,760 
Momentary madness.

1012
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,360 
You know it but won't admit it.

1013
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,760 
Because poverty and wealth
have different emotions.

1014
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,760 
You can dream of making your life.

1015
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,440 
Because you're rich.
l can only dream.

1016
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,280 
But not make life.

1017
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:26,800 
Why don't you understand..

1018
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:29,800 
The wealthy too are human.

1019
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,120 
A heart beats in their bosom too.

1020
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,720 
They can count their heart beats.

1021
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,240 
Not feel another's pain.

1022
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,760 
You have only written
imaginary stories. Fiction.

1023
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,080 
You can't understand life.

1024
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,760 
Possibly life doesn't understand me.

1025
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:56,760 
''To help life understand you,
you must first understand yourself.''

1026
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:05,760 
Convince yourself that
what you see...is no dream.

1027
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,160 
lt is reality.

1028
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,160 
Reality?

1029
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,760 
One who is away from reality
is teaching me about reality.

1030
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,760 
Now that's enough. Do you know
morning you'll be in Bangalore?

1031
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:26,800 
Stop fooling around.

1032
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,800 
You will never understand a woman.

1033
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:37,200 
You should've known a woman
who loved every refusal of yours...

1034
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,240 
What would be the limit of her
joy and love if you accepted her?

1035
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,720 
Even God wouldn't give it to you!

1036
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,720 
Do you hear me...?

1037
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,720 
You are right.

1038
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,720 
l am slow on the uptake.

1039
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,120 
Dim witted.

1040
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,480 
Angry...?

1041
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,760 
l have decided that
we must get married.

1042
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,400 
''ln fact, immediately. Right now.''

1043
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,080 
How can we get married now?

1044
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,760 
You need money to get married.

1045
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,760 
You know we have none.

1046
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:18,760 
l have an editor in Bangalore.

1047
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,080 
l am sure he'll give me money.

1048
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,360 
l think l'll go to him now.

1049
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,280 
l'll return with the
money by the morning.

1050
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,360 
Wait for me right here.

1051
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,720 
Say something.

1052
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:43,720 
Sleeping?

1053
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,720 
You heard none of what l said?

1054
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,720 
Okay.

1055
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,480 
l am going.

1056
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,760 
l'll return as your
groom in the morning.

1057
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,360 
But where will l get
money for the petrol?

1058
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,760 
Hello.

1059
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,360 
Excuse me...hello.

1060
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:28,160 
Hello. How much petrol do you want?

1061
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,440 
Not much. Just 2 gallons.

1062
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:33,760 
Take as much as you want.
We have an ocean here.

1063
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:38,680 
The name is Sagar but no
money to dip in the ocean.

1064
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,160 
Then why have you come to trouble me?

1065
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:46,720 
l have urgent work.
You may keep my bag instead.

1066
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,720 
- And give me fuel.
- No!

1067
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,120 
Take my cap too.
Looks great on you.

1068
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,720 
Women everywhere will love you.

1069
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:58,040 
- lf you don't return..?
- The bag and cap are yours.

1070
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,720 
l won't return it. Okay.

1071
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:24,240 
Who is it?

1072
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,080 
''Your admirer, Sagar.''

1073
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,760 
lts' you?

1074
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,040 
What are you doing?

1075
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,280 
All the editors will die
thirsty if Sagar dies.

1076
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:41,200 
l've got such a story that
all papers will vie for it.

1077
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:45,680 
lt's about Girdharilal's daughter.

1078
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,120 
Did you hear of it now?

1079
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,360 
- She's not marrying Suman.
- ls she marrying you?

1080
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:54,360 
Yes. That's what l came to tell you

1081
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,720 
You're out of your mind.
Get out of here!

1082
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,720 
What did you say? Girdharilal's
daughter is marrying you?

1083
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,120 
Yes.

1084
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,240 
l can get married right now
if you give me Rs. 1000.

1085
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,400 
- 1000 bucks?
- Merely a 1000

1086
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,720 
- Get out.
- Sit down.

1087
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:20,720 
This is a true story.

1088
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:22,760 
A matter of life and death for me.

1089
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:30,080 
''One beautiful morning, when l
was coming to Bangalore in the bus..''

1090
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,160 
This girl had run away from home.

1091
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,680 
Do you recall l'd called you?

1092
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:39,680 
''That very day, l was
sitting next to her...''

1093
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:45,680 
Dhannu's father!

1094
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,320 
Do you hear...?

1095
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:06,720 
Look at this witch!
She's sleeping alone!

1096
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:10,360 
l knew when l set eyes on her
that she has no character!

1097
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,720 
l'm not my father's daughter
if l don't throw her out!

1098
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,400 
Why are you screaming?
What happened?

1099
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,320 
Did you feel no shame?

1100
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,440 
- We are decent people!
- What nonsense?

1101
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,400 
Where is Sagar?

1102
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,720 
That's what l want to know
where is your shameful blot?

1103
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,720 
- Husband left the wife
in one night? - Shut up.

1104
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,400 
Have you no shame?

1105
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,680 
Sagar must have gone out.
He'll set everything right.

1106
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,280 
''What will he do? Check it
The bike, clothes are missing.''

1107
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,080 
His bag is missing.

1108
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,680 
Wonderful! What a story
lt went to my head.

1109
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,680 
l'll give you Rs. 2000

1110
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:01,120 
''But if the story is false,
l'll have you imprisoned.''

1111
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:04,200 
l'll write it on stamp paper.
Send me to the gallows.

1112
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,200 
Hurry with the payment.

1113
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:17,400 
But l want cash. l have
to pay the hotel bill.

1114
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:19,720 
Arrange for the wedding.
This will take time.

1115
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:24,200 
l know you're in a hurry.
But l don't have money here.

1116
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,120 
Encash the cheque at
10 when the bank opens.

1117
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:33,120 
Thank you so much.

1118
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:43,760 
Look at her face and compare it
with her deeds. Acts innocent.

1119
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,160 
Shameless hussy! Get out!

1120
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,080 
Out! Get out!

1121
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:00,760 
''lf l had my way,
l'd poison you!''

1122
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:04,040 
Don't show your face
around these parts!

1123
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,120 
Drown yourself if you have any shame!

1124
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,440 
Who..? My daughter Kammo!

1125
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,280 
How are you dear?

1126
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,760 
At Banarasilal's house?

1127
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,120 
What are you doing there?
l'll get there right away!

1128
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,720 
My daughter has been found!

1129
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,240 
Get the car ready fast.
l have found my daughter!

1130
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:46,720 
l'll leave now.
Get ready fast.

1131
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,160 
My baby...

1132
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:31,440 
You're weeping? Silly girl.

1133
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:35,720 
l have found the world's
treasures and you cry?

1134
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,200 
Forgive me.

1135
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:46,080 
Now l know what a sin it is to
run away from home and disobey elders

1136
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:49,240 
Neither God nor people forgive them.

1137
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:53,400 
My dear..but you committed no sin.

1138
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,720 
But that's what the world thinks.

1139
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:03,760 
My ears heard words that l
should have died before hearing.

1140
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,760 
Why do you care about the world?
l'll build you another world.

1141
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,240 
''No, they are not at fault.
My adamant nature is wrong.''

1142
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:22,760 
The times when a girl left
home only twice were good.

1143
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,240 
When she got married.

1144
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,760 
The other when she died.

1145
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:33,760 
You seem to have been hurt bad.

1146
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:40,040 
Do you know your Daddy hasn't
eaten since you left home?

1147
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:43,120 
Let's go home.
Thanks you madam.

1148
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,760 
''What? Found..
No, that's impossible.''

1149
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,720 
ls the story false?

1150
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,360 
Come in!

1151
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,720 
l'm not telling you!

1152
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,360 
l'll have him arrested!
l'll send him to jail!

1153
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:53,200 
Do you still claim
your story is true?

1154
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:07,080 
''Editor sir, sometimes god
disposes what man proposes.''

1155
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,400 
''Anyway, l've kept your money here.''

1156
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,200 
l hope you'll forgive me.

1157
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,760 
But...how did this happen so fast?

1158
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:22,760 
lt takes time for man
and destiny to take shape.

1159
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:24,440 
lt doesn't take long
to destroy them.

1160
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,240 
Love created its magic
while ruin was smiling.

1161
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,440 
She changed in a flash.

1162
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,760 
And the world changed with her.

1163
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:41,360 
Take this money.

1164
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,680 
How can l take the money
when the story isn't complete?

1165
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:48,200 
Your story will have a twist.

1166
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,200 
Then l'll claim it.

1167
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,120 
Keep it.

1168
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:57,200 
You're a young man.

1169
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,400 
And life is a long journey.

1170
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,400 
God knows how many such
stories will come your way.

1171
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,720 
''Sir, not everyday is one
fated to write such a tale.''

1172
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,320 
lt was written by the heart.

1173
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:17,240 
Now a few tears remain
in place of the blood.

1174
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,400 
Can one write stories with tears?

1175
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:27,200 
The best stories have been
written with tears not blood.

1176
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:33,160 
l am confident you'll write
even better after this failure.

1177
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:36,680 
l give you this sum as advance.

1178
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,200 
Here's our thief.

1179
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,400 
- Hand him over to the cops.
- Sure.

1180
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:10,200 
- You..?
- Yes. Recognise us?

1181
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,720 
''Yes, you are the memories
of very good times.''

1182
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720 
This man has changed
so much in 4 days.

1183
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,120 
There's no glow on his face.

1184
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,720 
Glow..She stole the glow and left.

1185
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,240 
He was interesting to talk to.

1186
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:29,760 
Today he sounds so sad.

1187
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:32,160 
What is wrong?

1188
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:37,000 
l wanted to meet you
and return the auto.

1189
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,680 
Return it after ruining it?

1190
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,680 
Pay me 1000 bucks. lsn't it?

1191
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:46,360 
Are you nuts?
Look at the poor chaps' face

1192
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:50,680 
''Okay, l won't take money.
We forgive you.''

1193
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,360 
My Bhagwan forgives you.

1194
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,680 
Thanks but l have money.

1195
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,360 
- Here..
- Thank you.

1196
01:58:02,120 --> 01:58:03,720 
''Here, take our bags.''

1197
01:58:26,760 --> 01:58:28,240 
l've been longing to see you.

1198
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,160 
l'm very tired now.

1199
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:59,120 
Who is that?

1200
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,680 
Money? What money?

1201
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,720 
No soup. Get corn.

1202
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,720 
Who is the jerk who asked for corn?

1203
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:29,720 
''- l did, Daddy.
- You...?''

1204
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,120 
Why?

1205
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,720 
Reminds me of good times.

1206
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:41,480 
The pleasure l found in the poor
man's food is missing elsewhere.

1207
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:46,480 
ls that so? Then we'll
eat corn at every meal.

1208
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,760 
Give me a bite.
Let me try it.

1209
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,760 
The princess will regret it.

1210
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,760 
The princess will regret it.

1211
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,280 
''What is wrong, my dear?''

1212
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,760 
''My relentless beloved..''

1213
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:15,760 
''Why did l fall for you?''

1214
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:19,120 
''Why did l fall for you?''

1215
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:24,240 
''Like l asked for sickness''

1216
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:28,760 
''Why did l fall for you?''

1217
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:38,240 
''My brutal beloved''

1218
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:11,160 
''Each time your cute
countenance comes to mind..''

1219
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:19,760 
''Each time your cute
countenance comes to mind..''

1220
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:24,760 
''l regret having fallen in love''

1221
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,720 
''l regret having fallen in love''

1222
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:40,720 
''l am tormented by your memories''

1223
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:53,720 
''Why did l fall for you?''

1224
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:10,760 
''My callous beloved''

1225
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:42,720 
''My crazy eyes have no solace
they search for you everywhere''

1226
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:51,440 
''My crazy eyes have no solace
they search for you everywhere''

1227
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:56,200 
''The bright night stings''

1228
02:04:04,240 --> 02:04:07,200 
''The bright night stings''

1229
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:12,760 
''ln whom can l confide?''

1230
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,760 
''My callous beloved''

1231
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:53,400 
''What is wrong, dear?''

1232
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:56,040 
what is wrong with you?

1233
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,720 
Tell me...

1234
02:04:58,480 --> 02:04:59,720 
Please tell me.

1235
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:08,400 
Sharing will increase the pain.

1236
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:21,760 
lf my wealth can bring
back your innocent smile...

1237
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,400 
l swear l'll give it away.

1238
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,760 
Certain joys in life...

1239
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:31,760 
...can't be purchased.

1240
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:35,680 
lt appears as if love
has wounded your heart.

1241
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:41,040 
''Like a cool breeze,
it can only be felt.''

1242
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,040 
lt can't be expressed.

1243
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:47,120 
What effect it had...

1244
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:49,200 
He is very fortunate.

1245
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,720 
The harder l tried to keep him away..

1246
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:55,200 
He came closer.

1247
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,200 
l want to say something to you.

1248
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:02,120 
Yes?

1249
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:06,160 
But l don't know how to say it.

1250
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:11,120 
l've arranged what you want to say.

1251
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:15,720 
l wanted to say something
at dinner but l couldn't.

1252
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:19,400 
See whose marriage card this is.

1253
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,080 
Marriage..

1254
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:27,760 
- My marriage..
- Yes.

1255
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:30,240 
To Suman. You love him.

1256
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,760 
Your love won over my rejection.

1257
02:06:34,160 --> 02:06:38,040 
l'll celebrate your wedding
grandly. Everyone will be amazed.

1258
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:41,680 
''Now smile, my dear.''

1259
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:45,360 
There comes a smile..
the lips are moving..

1260
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,160 
My child..

1261
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:49,720 
l'm very happy.

1262
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,120 
Very happy.

1263
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:58,720 
l know the happiest day in
a father's life is when..

1264
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,720 
When his daughter gets married.

1265
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:05,720 
God didn't bless you with a son.

1266
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,040 
He only gave you a daughter.

1267
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,720 
He didn't give you other joys.

1268
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:15,240 
He put you in a state..

1269
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:19,240 
where there was no solution
except to accept this marriage.

1270
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,720 
l'm responsible for this.

1271
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:28,720 
l should have died on birth!

1272
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,240 
You're crying on this joyous occasion

1273
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:34,680 
l'm happy at this union.

1274
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,680 
Really. Your happiness makes me happy.

1275
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:41,080 
My joy lies in your joy.

1276
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:43,680 
May you live long.

1277
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,720 
''The bride leaves
for her beloved's home''

1278
02:09:08,120 --> 02:09:11,720 
''The bride smiles in her veil
May the pair always be happy''

1279
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,720 
''Don't forget us''

1280
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:20,720 
''Don't forget us''

1281
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,400 
''The bride leaves
for her beloved's home''

1282
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:26,080 
''The bride smiles in her veil''

1283
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:28,480 
''May the pair always be happy''

1284
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:33,240 
''Don't ever forget us''

1285
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:06,360 
''Lost the days of childhood''

1286
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:10,440 
''Youth brought along the beloved''

1287
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,160 
''Lost the days of childhood''

1288
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,800 
''Youth brought along the beloved''

1289
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:24,240 
''Youth brought along the beloved''

1290
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:30,800 
''Don't shed tears when the
family is celebrating at home''

1291
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:33,440 
''May you always be happy''

1292
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:03,760 
''This is the custom of the world''

1293
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:06,760 
''lt is the custom''

1294
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:12,760 
''The one who holds your
hand is your partner''

1295
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:15,360 
''He is your partner''

1296
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:19,760 
''The one who holds your
hand is your partner''

1297
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:26,200 
''Now we are not your family
He means all to you''

1298
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,760 
''May you be happy
Don't ever forget us''

1299
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:10,080 
''l beg you never to forget
the exciting swings of spring''

1300
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:19,760 
''l beg you never to forget
the exciting swings of spring''

1301
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:30,440 
''When you come visiting
we hope you have a baby''

1302
02:13:06,160 --> 02:13:11,760 
''l thank all the reporters.
Excuse me, l don't have much time.''

1303
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:14,760 
You break our hearts.

1304
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:18,160 
We came from across the country
for bride's picture and interview

1305
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:23,760 
We'll be grateful if we
could hear the bride speak.

1306
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:28,160 
And take a few of her
pretty pictures for our papers

1307
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:31,280 
Very well.

1308
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:37,040 
lt is difficult but l won't break
your heart on this joyous day.

1309
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,160 
What's wrong?
Why the delay?

1310
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:12,760 
Go and check.

1311
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:18,160 
Good day.

1312
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:24,760 
why did you choose Suman
the pilot as your life partner?

1313
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:30,760 
Because we hear there's
life on the moon and stars.

1314
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,760 
He'll take her there.

1315
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:37,680 
Did your love take flight
in the air or on earth?

1316
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,200 
l can't recall.

1317
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:43,720 
Love has no relation
with air or ground.

1318
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:45,720 
lt can begin anywhere.

1319
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:50,720 
ls this a marriage of
your choice or your fathers'?

1320
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:53,040 
Both of us.

1321
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:57,200 
Now we beg leave.
lt's time for the marriage.

1322
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,200 
Congratulations.

1323
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:10,080 
''Just a minute, madam.''

1324
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:17,200 
''Excuse me, l have some
urgent questions for you.''

1325
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:21,360 
No questions will be answered
after the time is past.

1326
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,240 
''- Daddy, let's go.
- Wait.''

1327
02:15:24,360 --> 02:15:26,760 
l'll be forced to
print whatever l wish...

1328
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:28,440 
..about the 4 days after
you ran away from this ship.

1329
02:15:28,760 --> 02:15:32,440 
''lf you write irresponsibly,
the paper will be sued.''

1330
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:37,080 
After leaving Madarilal's inn
and making fun of a poor man...

1331
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:39,680 
What right did you
have to return home?

1332
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:42,080 
My wish. l don't want to answer.

1333
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,120 
l don't want to answer anything.

1334
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:45,720 
''You will have to answer,
pretty nuisance.''

1335
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:48,720 
Talk with respect.
l am to marry another.

1336
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,720

1337
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:54,400 
What is the matter?
What do you want?

1338
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,400

''ls this your humanity?

1342
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:06,720 
''All right, dear.''

1343
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:22,760 
Here you are.

1344
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:27,240 
Rs. 125000

1345
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:31,160 
l don't want your reward.

1346
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:32,760 
Then what do you want?

1347
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:35,040 
''Here, read it.''

1348
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:41,280

Corn...

1352
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:53,720 
''Carrot, radish and corn...''

1354
02:16:56,720 --> 02:16:58,200 
l'm asking for it
only on principle.

1355
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:00,720 
A poor man would have left it.

1356
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,720 
''l admit, you seem like a crooked man''

1357
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:06,720 
Yes. Don't you see how
l set her right in 4days?

1358
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:08,720 
You couldn't in 20 years.

1359
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,720 
- Forgive me..
- Yes.

1360
02:17:11,720 --> 02:17:13,120 
l'll just get back.

1361
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:17,120 
Then why did you leave me?

1362
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:19,720 
l left or did you leave?

1363
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:22,240 
l went to get money for the marriage

1364
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:24,400 
l left a note under your
pillow. Did you read it?

1365
02:17:24,760 --> 02:17:26,720 
Don't you have eyes?
Apologise if you have shame!

1366
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:28,240 
l won't!

1367
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,720 
''lf this weren't your father's
house, l'd break your pretty nose!''

1368
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,680 
lt's your house not her Pop's
Give her a nice smack!

1369
02:18:00,720 --> 02:18:02,200 
Where is baby?

1370
02:18:03,720 --> 02:18:06,720 
''Son, you didn't address
me as Daddy today?''

1371
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:09,720 
''Daddy, the time for the
marriage is passing by.''

1372
02:18:10,120 --> 02:18:14,440 
Not baby's. The time for
your marriage has gone by.

1373
02:18:14,720 --> 02:18:17,200 
- What do you mean?
- l mean...

1374
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:21,240 
- Baby has gone. - Where?
- With her beloved.

1375
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:25,720 
''The bride leaves
for her beloved's home''

1376
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:28,240 
''She shyly smiles under the veil''

1377
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:30,720 
''May you always be happy''

1378
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,680 
''Don't ever forget me''
