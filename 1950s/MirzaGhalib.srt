1
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,310
This film is based on some
incidents in Mirza Ghalib's life...

2
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,170
in which, many imaginary incidents...

3
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,550
and characters have been included.

4
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,570
They should therefore, not
be deemed real or historic.

5
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,530
Year 1833 B.C., the capital of
the Moghul empire, Delhi...

6
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,930
which, since the times
of the Pandavs...

7
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,780
had been captured
and looted many times.

8
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,790
And every time, the hands of man,
that never accept defeat...

9
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,040
rebuilt it even more beautifully.

10
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:47,430
The Qutub Minar, like the always
rising passion in the heart...

11
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,370
trying to touch the sky,
and speaking poetically.

12
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,490
Jama Masjid, shows the way
to those gone astray.

13
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,490
The Red Fort,
a symbol of Moghul grandeur.

14
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,540
Every building, every street,
every corner, was young.

15
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,950
Every stone was beautiful.

16
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,710
But regretfully,the revolutionary
world didn't like its style...

17
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,740
and the Sun of the Moghul empire,
after ruling for 400 years...

18
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,580
was now setting.

19
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,480
The last ray of this sun, the last
king of the Moghul empire...

20
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,390
was King Bahadur Shah Zafar,
in whose court...

21
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,480
were famous poets like...

22
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,170
Sheikh lbrahim Zauk, Balmukund
Huzur, Momin Khan Momin,

23
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,190
Fazruddin Khan Adrullah,
Mustafa Khan Sheista...

24
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,460
Shahjahan Aish and
Mohammed Ali Tishna.

25
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,400
They all were renowned poets.

26
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,280
There was another flame apart
from these poets...

27
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,590
who wanted to brighten every corner
of the world with his light.

28
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,420
'Even a gesture is enough'

29
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,180
'As the love grows,
so does the silence'

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,150
l wonder where he is spreading
his words again.

31
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,340
He's gone both day and night.

32
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,840
He doesn't even care that
he has a wife at home.

33
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,420
Why don't you speak?
Look at me!

34
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,810
Allah! You are composing
poetry. Sorry.

35
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,200
Coming, father.

36
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,650
Yes, father.

37
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,580
Did you find out where
your husband is?

38
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
He is at home.

39
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,700
He hasn't left home for four days.

40
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,800
Do support your husband,
but don't lie to your father.

41
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,250
l haven't seen his
face for five days.

42
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,210
Let me see what he's doing.

43
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,140
We'll be late
for the poetry recital.

44
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,040
He's composing for the recital.
l just saw him.

45
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,570
He must be cursing his own destiny.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,570
l haven't come across
a more unfortunate man.

47
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,210
He has let so many good
opportunities go.

48
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,790
lf this continues, he'll
make you beg one day.

49
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,790
He'll even squander away
his ancestral wealth.

50
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,920
What a man l let marry
my beautiful daughter!

51
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,550
He is not at all worthy of her.

52
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,900
- Greetings father.
- Greetings. Where are you going?

53
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,620
To the fort. Won't you come
for the poetry recital?

54
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,710
l'm not sure.
Did you finish composing?

55
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,810
lt died on the composing table.

56
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,150
Oh God...

57
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,890
Attention!

58
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,910
The scion of the Moghul empire...

59
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:33,760
King Bahadur Shah Zafar...

60
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,900
the King of Hindustan, is coming.

61
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,740
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

62
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,470

63
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,670
lnvitees, we begin the recital...

64
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,970
with poetry composed by the King.

65
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,710
Hear it with respect.

66
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,610
'ln love, l do not
have this complaint'

67
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,400
'That l am left with no peace of mind'

68
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,350
'Sorrow has become my friend'

69
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,104
'l don't care whether or not

70
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:38,880
l have anyone
else to call my own'

71
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:48,770
'When realization had not dawned...'

72
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,410
'l would always notice others'
faults and qualities'

73
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,190
'But when l realized
the faults in me...'

74
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,040
'l saw no more the faults in others'

75
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,580
'Zafar says, he is not a man...'

76
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,190
'however renowned he may be...'

77
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,430
'the one who has forgotten
God in his good days'

78
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,750
'Who is so proud,
that he does not fear God?'

79
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:48,860
lnvitees, the lamp is now being placed
before Mufti Saddruddin Khan.

80
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,130
Please hear his compositions.

81
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,520
- Do l have your permission?
- Proceed.

82
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,050
l recite...

83
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,630
'When have l not been infamous?'

84
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,210
'When is the sky not the earth,
and the earth not the sky?'

85
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,250
'l want to say one thing,
but say something else...'

86
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,550
'and then call it a slip of the tongue'

87
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,730
Lala Balmukund Huzur.

88
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,590
'No strength in my legs,
no power in my hands...'

89
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,550
'that can help me pull
the hand of my beloved'

90
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,730
'l am sitting in the street'

91
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,360
'You are beside me...'

92
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,880
'when l have no one else'

93
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Hazrat Momin Khan Momin.

94
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,370
'She is not affected'

95
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:49,300
'You are close to me'

96
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:03,920
'No one else is there'

97
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,580
Hold your breath. lt's my turn.

98
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:20,000
The flame is being brought
before lbrahim Zouk.

99
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,290
Hear with rapt attention.

100
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,860
The opening lines are...

101
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,610
Begin.

102
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:37,170
'Now l fear and say l will die'

103
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:56,410
'But if l don't find peace even
after l die, where will l go?'

104
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:17,210
'l am not among those
who claim to have you'

105
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,340
'ln fact, even if God asks
me, l will deny it'

106
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,950
You are simply great.

107
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,200
Mirza Assadullah Khan.

108
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,870
Alias, Mirza Nausha,
whose pen name is Ghalib.

109
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,740
- Now l will recite my poetry.
- Proceed.

110
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,070
Begin.

111
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,230
- l begin.
- Yes.

112
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,660
'Even a gesture is enough'

113
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,180
'As the love grows,
so does the silence'

114
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,750
Wow, that's lovely.

115
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,600
'She has never understood,
nor will she ever understand me'

116
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,910
'Why did l have to give my
heart to someone like that?'

117
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,950
lt's a gathering of thankless men.

118
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,250
'There are many good
poets in the world'

119
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,460
'lt's just that Ghalib's
style is different'

120
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,440
We don't want to hear
this self praise.

121
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,330
Damn such self praise!

122
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,600
Get lost!

123
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,360
- l won't stay here now.
- That will be insulting the gathering.

124
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,400
You don't care about my being insulted.
Even the king doesn't.

125
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,580
l'm leaving.

126
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,280
- Let's go.
- Where?

127
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,580
Anywhere, but take
me away from here.

128
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,140
Away from this gathering
of uncouth, ungrateful men.

129
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,510
- Very far away.
- Lift it... careful... turn right.

130
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,670
My heart is full of woe

131
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,480
l cannot but tell her

132
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Why try somewhere...

133
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,680
when nothing can be done?

134
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,960
My heart is full of woe

135
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:43,560
A stranger roams with your letters

136
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,630
lf someone asks what this is all about...

137
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,390
l won't be able to hide it

138
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,670
My heart is full of woe

139
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,230
l do call her...

140
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:37,360
but, oh, my heart's full of emotions

141
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,300
lt should affect her such...

142
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,150
that she cannot stop
herself from coming

143
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,350
My heart is full of woe

144
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:43,340
No one can control love.
lt is such a fire

145
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,760
lt is slow to ignite...

146
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,600
but once lit,
it can't be doused

147
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,150
My heart is full of woe...

148
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,780
but once lit,
it can't be doused

149
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,980
He has come.
Mother, he has come.

150
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,150
Who are you?
What do you want?

151
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,440
l don't want anything.
l want to meet somebody.

152
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,320
Who is it dear?

153
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,550
He wants to meet someone, mother.

154
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,960
Who does he want to meet?

155
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,100
Who do you want to meet?

156
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,520
The one who was reciting
Mirza's poetry.

157
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,790
He says the one who was
reciting Mirza's poetry.

158
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,240
Who is he?
What kind of a man is he?

159
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,860
Does a decent man come to
anyone's home at this hour?

160
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,330
Mother says which decent man comes
to anyone's home at this hour?

161
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,830
l am a decent man. l'm a poet.
l'm returning from...

162
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,060
the Royal poetry recital.

163
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,970
You are coming from the Royal
poetry recital? You heard Mirza's poetry?

164
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,430
He was going to recite poetry there.
Come. Why are you standing outside?

165
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,540
You are coming from the poetry
recital? You heard Mirza's poetry?

166
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,580
Did you hear him yourself?
How is his voice?

167
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,910
How does he recite?
Does he sing it?

168
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,970
The King must have been
all praise for him.

169
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,370
He must have bowled over everyone.

170
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,950
No one could have competed with him.

171
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,220
Pardon me, l showered you with
questions the moment you came.

172
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,440
Please come.

173
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,890
Please come, sit down.

174
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,870
What kind of a man is Mirza?
l mean, looks wise.

175
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,480
What about his nature?

176
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,250
- You don't say anything.
- When have you let me speak?

177
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,200
Sorry. Please speak.

178
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,170
l am returning from the recital.
l heard Mirza's poetry.

179
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,960
- He writes well.
- Didn't l say so, Mother?

180
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:49,060
He has a soft face.
He's fair, tall, handsome.

181
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,770
But he has an attitude.

182
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,740
He is quick to anger,
and takes long to calm down.

183
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
Lies! Absolute lies!

184
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,810
You speak as if you have seen Mirza.

185
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,370
So what if l've not seen him,
but l have read and heard about him.

186
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,140
He is such a good poet.

187
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,280
lf l could, l'd talk about
him in every street.

188
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,780
Really? Say the word and
l'll call him.

189
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:16,030
But we are poor people.
Why would he meet us?

190
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,100
He must not even be aware of us.

191
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,200
This is his couplet.

192
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:33,960
'l agree you won't
betray me, but...'

193
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:43,500
'l will be dead by
the time you know'

194
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,170
God! What is this girl doing!

195
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,880
lf they hear you,
what will people say?

196
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,020
Come on now, Mother!

197
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,880
Madam, even l am a poet.
Though an inconsequential one.

198
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,900
With your permission,
may l recite something?

199
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,230
What do you say?

200
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,230
Proceed.

201
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,330
l begin...

202
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,460
'Even a gesture is enough'

203
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,450
'As the love grows,
so does the silence'

204
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,930
lt's okay.

205
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,570
'She has never understood,
nor will she ever understand me'

206
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,340
'Why did l have to give my
heart to someone like that?'

207
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,330
- Here, have betel leaf.
- l am like that only.

208
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,090
You don't appreciate my poetry.

209
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,440
l thank you for the betel leaf.

210
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,310
lt's not that. Your poetry is okay.

211
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,130
But you should realize there's
something special about Mirza.

212
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,010
Maybe. l only know...

213
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,450
that his ancestors
were good marksmen.

214
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,920
Mirza must be good at
wielding a stick.

215
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,790
Pardon me, but please don't talk
like that in my presence.

216
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,030
He should do as his ancestors.
Poetry is not his cup of tea.

217
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,900
- Please leave!
- What?

218
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,550
l said leave!

219
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,330
Poetry is not his cup of tea.
As if he understands poetry!

220
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,690
He's blind, and is called doe eyed!

221
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,440
'l had heard of humiliations, but...'

222
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,230
'l left your home badly humiliated'

223
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,400
- Whatever, but he was our guest.
- We don't want such a guest.

224
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,670
Look at his daring!

225
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,600
He was talking ill about
Mirza in my presence.

226
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,600
l could have pushed
him from up here.

227
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,590
Kotwal Saheb!
Give me Mirza's poetry.

228
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,390
- You still need Mirza's poetry?
- What do you mean?

229
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,440
Why wouldn't l need his poetry?

230
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,190
When Mirza has himself
started coming here...

231
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,060
then why do you need his poetry?

232
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,750
Congratulations on his coming here.

233
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,210
Mirza's coming here?
Are you out of your mind?

234
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,340
Mother, did you hear what
Kotwal Saheb is saying?

235
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,130
We don't even know him.

236
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,410
Then how did l see Mirza
leaving your house?

237
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,240
- lt must be Mirza's ghost.
- Don't talk like that.

238
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,100
Why should it be his ghost?
May he live long.

239
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,460
Give me Mirza's poetry.

240
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,280
'Even a gesture is enough...'

241
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,630
Oh my God!

242
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,280
'There are many good
poets in the world'

243
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,730
'lt's just that Ghalib's
style is different'

244
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,180
Mother! Hold me! What have l done!

245
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,980
How much l humiliated Mirza.
And he got annoyed and left.

246
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,350
There won't be a more
unfortunate woman than l.

247
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,770
God himself came to my door,
and l turned him away.

248
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,310
l wasn't hospitable,
nor did l welcome him.

249
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,900
Such people don't come everyday.

250
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,560
They are not the sun or moon
to rise and set everyday.

251
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,750
- Greetings father.
- Bless you.

252
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,740
Wait! Where are you coming from
so early in the morning?

253
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,890
- From the poetry recital.
- The one that ended at 1 AM?

254
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,770
lt is morning now.
Where were you for so long?

255
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,710
l met friends. We sat chatting
and it got late.

256
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:06,630
Great. Alright, what accolades
did you win at the recital?

257
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,870
None. There were so many others.

258
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,990
Why are you coughing?
When you arrive, just walk in.

259
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,380
l'm coming.
Let me remove my shoes first.

260
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,100
The Koran has been read
here all night.

261
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,610
There are mats somewhere,
and a wash bowl somewhere.

262
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,360
The room seems like a mosque.

263
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,060
How can a sinner like me...

264
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,370
enter the room of a pious wife
wearing my shoes?

265
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,430
Don't make excuses.

266
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,210
Tell me the truth.
Did Allah answer my prayers?

267
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,550
Were you successful
at the poetry recital?

268
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,340
Only you and your Allah know that.

269
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,590
There were only two people
who appreciated it.

270
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,260
Mr. Mufti and Nawab Sheikhda.

271
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,470
God bless them.

272
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,310
Your enemies?

273
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,990
They are not my enemies.
l was only unsuccessful.

274
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,260
Very unsuccessful.

275
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,330
l was already reeling from humiliation,
and then father chided me.

276
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,600
Don't mind his words,
it's his habit.

277
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,600
That's alright, but l won't
stay here any longer.

278
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,290
Tomorrow, Miyan sir is
renting out his house.

279
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,180
What do you say?

280
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,280
What can l say?

281
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,690
l will go wherever you go.

282
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,650
l will be at your feet.

283
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:57,450
Dear, had you not been there...

284
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,510
l don't know what l would
have done to myself.

285
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,360
Come, Mirza, come.
What are you doing?

286
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,140
Great, great.

287
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,560
l'm fed up with your goat.
Come on. Great, great.

288
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,830
Mr. Khan, my wife too thanks you.

289
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,510
What of thanks, Mirza, the house
was lying empty anyway.

290
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,280
- lt has life again, now that
you've come. - Thanks.

291
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,690
Tell me. Do you need any money?

292
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,340
No, thank you. God has
been kind to me.

293
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,050
l get Rs. 2,000 per annum from
the British government.

294
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,730
We manage to survive
with that money.

295
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,380
And then, l have many
friends in Agra.

296
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,500
Hello Mirza.

297
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,420
Mathuradas! What brings you here?

298
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,390
- Sir, my money...
- Yes... yes, l understand.

299
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,280
Mr. Kale, excuse me.

300
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,840
My money...

301
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,550
Speak softly! l'll repay your
every penny. Have patience.

302
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,110
How patient can l be?

303
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,320
You have only sent me
two installments.

304
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,540
lt's been five months since then
and you haven't sent a single penny.

305
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,010
ln our religion, it is said...

306
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,940
that if someone takes
even a copper coin...

307
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,340
and doesn't repay it, he has to
pay a gold coin in Allah's court.

308
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,090
- Why do you need to worry now?
- Spoken like a poet again!

309
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,100
l will not go to Allah.
l will go to Bhagwan (God).

310
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,100
Go wherever you like,
but spare me now.

311
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,040
- When do l come again?
- Go now, at least, return later.

312
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,630
Alright, but l won't wait
too long for the money.

313
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,910
Mirza Nausha, why did the
money lender come here?

314
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,920
For no reason.
He's an old friend from Agra.

315
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,430
He has some of my deposits.
He wanted me to take them back.

316
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,160
He said the interest
is too much for him.

317
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,590
- Okay. Good day.
- Good day.

318
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,920
What a time you chose to come,
Mahajan (money lender).

319
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,970
Oh, it's you?

320
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,770
How much money have you collected
with the money lender?

321
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,310
Buy me gold bangles.

322
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,260
l will, when you beget a son.

323
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,710
As if l didn't sire any.

324
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,250
But if they died as soon
as they were born...

325
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,730
how am l to be blamed for it?

326
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,070
- You are very quick-witted.
- Yes, l'm the only quick-witted one.

327
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,500
You are very naive.

328
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:47,680
- Where are you going now?
- To change my taste.

329
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
Mr. Mufti has given an invitation
to eat mangoes.

330
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,820
Wow! The country which
grows mangoes...

331
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,350
why won't other countries
eye it with envy?

332
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,300
- They are so sweet.
- Even sugarcane is sweet.

333
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,060
Now come on, Nawab!

334
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,680
'Ask me, what do you know'

335
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,470
'Compared to mangoes,
sugarcane is nothing'

336
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,300
Sugarcane is only sweet.

337
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,540
But there is a slight tanginess
in a mango's sweetness.

338
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,490
Like a woman who is beautiful,
and a little tangy too.

339
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,630
Mangoes may be tasty, but
they are not that good.

340
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,530
Look, even donkeys don't eat them.

341
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Those who are donkeys
don't eat them.

342
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,350
l'll recite a couplet in praise of mangoes.

343
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,640
Go ahead.

344
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:02,080
'The mango is the king of fruits'

345
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,700
Even the couplet on mangoes
is so complex.

346
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,380
l ask, why don't you
write simple poetry?

347
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,590
One earns praise only if
his poetry is understood.

348
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,650
Or he's not considered
a poet at all.

349
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,850
Which fool wants to
be praised by fools?

350
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,970
'l don't care for praise'

351
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,790
'lf l don't have any admirers,
l don't care'

352
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,180
l am reminded of the words of
the late Mir Faisal about him.

353
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,000
He said that if he
finds a good admirer...

354
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,570
he'll become a great poet.

355
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,070
- Or he'll be a nonentity.
-You are my good admirer, Mr. Mufti.

356
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,770
Even a gesture is enough

357
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:48,470
As the love grows,
so does the silence

358
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:01,910
He has never understood,
nor will he ever understand me

359
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:16,670
Why did l have to give my
heart to someone like that?

360
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,970
When you are in the city,
l won't have any problems

361
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,070
l'll go to the bazaar...

362
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:50,330
Mir has made this poet famous.

363
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,710
Beggars are singing his poems.

364
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,470
Listen!

365
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,950
From whom did you learn this song?

366
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,150
You can say it's God's gift.

367
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,900
A girl lives in my neighborhood.

368
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,620
She takes mercy on this
poor man and teaches me...

369
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,640
so that l can make a living.

370
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,860
- What is her name?
- Her name is Moti Begum.

371
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,470
But why does she calls herself
Chaudvin Begum these days?

372
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,640
Whenever she sings, she only
sings Mirza's poetry.

373
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,560
What is your opinion of Mirza?

374
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,830
'There are many good
poets in the world'

375
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,960
'lt's just that Ghalib's
style is different'

376
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:04,760
'There are many good
poets in the world'

377
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:11,300
'lt's just that Ghalib's
style is different'

378
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,260
- Good day, Mr. Mufti.
- Where are you going, Mirza?

379
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,890
Where my poetry is understood.

380
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,440
Strange man.

381
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,130
Get lost! Why are you shouting?

382
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,950
You don't even let me
rest at all.

383
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,670
Alright then, take rest. Mirza
is waiting at the door.

384
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,830
- Honest?
- l swear by you.

385
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,970
He's the same man
from the other day.

386
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,930
l am wearing such dirty clothes.

387
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,920
Mother, get me a
good set of clothes.

388
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,960
Keep him busy with conversation
for awhile and then bring him up.

389
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,220
Okay.

390
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,320
Fix my hair, mother.

391
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,450
Fix it yourself,
l'm not your servant.

392
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,220
His coming to our house
every day isn't right.

393
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,600
People will talk.

394
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
l'll be glad. Maybe something
clicks between us.

395
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,490
Mirza! Please come in.

396
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,480
'He has come to my house.
lt is God's grace'

397
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,150
'l sometimes look at him,
and sometimes at my house'

398
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,190
l wouldn't go uninvited even
to God's home. But...

399
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,550
'But it should affect him such...'

400
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,680
'that he cannot stop
himself from coming'

401
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,010
You can assume that.

402
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,430
l met the beggar who was
singing my composition.

403
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,140
And found your invitation in it.

404
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,780
So l came.

405
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,050
What do l say about your kindness?

406
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,580
l said so many things
about you that day.

407
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,700
No. You said all that to the
one who came that day.

408
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:49,110
You praised me. ln fact, you
fought with me for me.

409
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,890
lf it were only that it would've
been okay. But l...

410
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,930
Threw me out of the house.

411
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,000
You did very well.

412
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,160
The 'l' that was between the
two of us, has gone.

413
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,710
lt is only us who have remained.
l am hers, what about me...

414
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,020
You are such a great man, Mirza.

415
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,580
l thought l wouldn't be spared
in the two worlds.

416
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,310
- How do l thank you?
- Don't say that, Chaudvin Begum.

417
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,480
You consider yourself inconsequential?

418
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,870
But it's not your fault.

419
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,630
Even you are among those who
don't know their worth.

420
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,860
A stone in the street is
not considered worthy.

421
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,130
lf noticed,
even a stone is a diamond.

422
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,570
lf unnoticed,
even a diamond is a stone.

423
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,800
Ask me what you are.

424
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,040
l was dejected with life...

425
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,950
and complaining to God.

426
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,570
'Serve me a drink, oh bartender'

427
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,680
'lf you hate me so,
don't give me a goblet'

428
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,270
'At least give me liquor'

429
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,200
l heard you reciting
my composition...

430
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,530
when l was feeling so low.

431
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,780
And l felt l had found
my lost destination.

432
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,650
Yes Chaudvin. Even today, the
situation was the same.

433
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,100
l had problems at home,
and was shunned by my friends.

434
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,880
l have come here. l feel lost.

435
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,580
lntroduce me to myself again.

436
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,450
Mirza, l had this desire for ages...

437
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,150
that l sing your composition
in your presence.

438
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,520
l wish l had asked for more
from Allah today.

439
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,950
Yes Moti Begum. Look what
l have bought for you.

440
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,330
Some trinkets for you.

441
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,180
They are better than his couplets.

442
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,820
But there are some couplets...

443
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,900
which even your entire
wealth cannot buy.

444
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,120
This one coin can buy
all your poetry.

445
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,430
Try it!

446
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,520
Kotwal Saheb! You
have come. Welcome!

447
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,990
Yes madam, and l have even brought
a gift for your daughter.

448
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,590
Jewelry! Wow! lt's beautiful.

449
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,660
Not Moti Begum, Chaudvin Begum!

450
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,190
You dare to flirt with Mirza
in my presence...

451
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,420
and make fun of my love?

452
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,820
Don't you know who l am? l have
taught many like you a lesson.

453
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,020
l am the Kotwal (police
chief) of Delhi city.

454
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,300
Kotwal, don't mind her, she's crazy.

455
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,690
- Maybe, but l'm not his slave.
- Damn you, girl!

456
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,520
You compare the Kotwal
with that petty poet?

457
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,560
You should thank your stars...

458
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,540
that such an important man
is interested in you.

459
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,550
Or who cares for us small people?

460
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,870
- lf you marry, it will only be to him.
- No, l won't marry him!

461
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,500
l am a girl,
not a criminal to be flogged.

462
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,930
Have you heard, elder sis?
ls this your decision?

463
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,480
Constable sir,
what do l do with this girl?

464
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:24,130
She has just learned to fly.

465
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,060
Her craziness over Mirza will
be gone in a few days.

466
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,910
l'll take care of Mirza.

467
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,760
- You fix the marriage date.
- Anything to suit you.

468
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,510
Will Friday be alright?

469
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,730
So soon? lt's already Monday today.

470
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,340
What have you got to do?

471
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,300
l'll spend money, l'll make
all the arrangements.

472
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:45,930
And remember, On Friday,
l will come as a groom...

473
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,650
and take my bride away.

474
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:03,650
The bride is going to her groom.
She need not fear anyone now

475
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,360
My husband is a police chief

476
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:40,360
l am the beloved of my husband

477
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,060
One look, and l pierce his heart

478
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:52,120
My hands are red with henna

479
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,880
My husband is a police chief

480
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,670
As a bride, l develop an attitude

481
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,450
l don't meet anyone's eyes now

482
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:36,010
No one can dare to look at me

483
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,920
My husband is a police chief

484
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,860
l will rule in my husband's home

485
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:06,210
l won't fear my mother-in-law
or sister-in-law

486
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,770
l will throw out my brother-in-law

487
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,970
My husband is a police chief

488
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:30,580
The bride is going to her groom.
She need not fear anyone now

489
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,680
My husband is a police chief

490
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:01,110
- Fittan!
- What is it, madam?

491
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,630
Deliver this letter for me.

492
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:08,510
- Yes.
- You just take the letter and leave?

493
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,560
Did you ask who it's addressed to,
or where you it's to be delivered?

494
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:14,120
Madam, it is for Mirza, who else?

495
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,230
What do you think of Fittan,
madam, l know everything.

496
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,310
l taste opium, but l keep tabs
even on seventh heaven.

497
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,120
Fittan sir, where are you going?
Won't this betel leaf be eaten today?

498
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,910
No, today l am going for
a very important...

499
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:56,050
l swear on God! l can't take
my eyes off you today.

500
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,620
These beautiful bangles
on the fair wrists.

501
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,150
Laces on the scarf.
Oh, my heart trembles.

502
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,110
You prepare the betel leaf.
l'll be right back.

503
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,150
Why don't you eat it?
What is so urgent?

504
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:16,500
- You don't know. The work is such.
- Really?

505
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:20,660
Yes, today no devil
or fairy can stop me today.

506
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,970
Damn! l've come across
the devil's home again.

507
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,710
Where have you been, Fittan?
Come, let's share a smoke.

508
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,560
Don't mention it! l hate it!

509
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,290
And l even hate to see
others smoke drugs.

510
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:59,710
What is life without a smoke?

511
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,490
Damn! l'll have to inhale some now.

512
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:08,760
But only once, don't insist
that l stay long.

513
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,360
Just puff. lf you insist on more,
God will take care of you.

514
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,860
l won't.

515
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,780
l have some important business
to attend to.

516
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,160
Keep going.

517
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:35,750
Come, Fittan! Tipu,
even you have come?

518
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,520
- Moti, has Fittan returned?
- No.

519
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,690
l sent him on Tuesday and
it's Thursday today.

520
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,930
l wonder where he disappeared
with the letter.

521
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:15,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

522
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:22,290
- You dropped your letter.
- Letter? Letter?

523
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,830
l was supposed to deliver this.

524
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,790
Damn me!
l wasted so much time.

525
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,030
But it's not late yet.

526
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:48,210
Late for what?
Come and have a smoke.

527
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,910
No, l'll be going. lt's Tuesday
today, we'll meet next Tuesday.

528
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,920
'God bless this city'

529
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,680
'lt's now Thursday night'

530
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,330
Thursday night?

531
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,560
'Oh gentleman, hear my plea'

532
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:22,710
'God will bless you with riches'

533
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:28,220
'Give some alms to this beggar'

534
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,020
'lt's now Thursday night'

535
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,140
Wait! What nonsense are you saying?

536
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,890
lt's not Thursday night.

537
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:39,390
-You can't make any day Thursday.
- Today is Thursday.

538
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,020
- Don't try to fool me!
- Any problem, Fittan?

539
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,450
No. He claims today is Thursday.

540
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,870
Thursday, are you crazy?
lt's Tuesday today.

541
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,720
Ask for a copper coin,
today is Tuesday.

542
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,510
- Yes, it's Tuesday today.
- God help them.

543
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,070
Attention!

544
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:09,610
A fair has been organized in Meerut
tomorrow, that is, Friday.

545
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:15,270
Traders can sell their
wares at the fair.

546
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:24,930
lf today is Thursday night, where
did Wednesday disappear?

547
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,140
l'm wondering the same thing.

548
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,540
Now l understand!
That day was Tuesday.

549
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,810
Yes.

550
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,940
- We slept through Wednesday.
- Yes.

551
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,560
And we regained our senses
on Thursday night.

552
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:44,050
lt's Thursday night.
Please give some alms.

553
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,510
Here, take a coin.
You win, l lose.

554
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,070
- Thank God it's Thursday night.
- God bless you.

555
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,050
Not Friday. l have an
important errand.

556
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,370
Damn!

557
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,990
What's the matter, Kallu?
Why is the door not opening?

558
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,170
Wonder what the matter is.

559
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,870
First, my father-in-law used
to stop me, then my wife.

560
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,940
Now even the doors and walls
have begun to stop me.

561
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:46,600
Sir, someone is sleeping
at the door.

562
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:51,980
- Hey get up! Who are you?
- Me? l am Fittan.

563
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,220
- What day is it today?
- Friday.

564
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,320
Friday! Damn!

565
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,970
Thank Allah!

566
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:10,830
l've brought this letter for you.

567
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,790
l didn't want to be late,
so l came in the early morning.

568
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,880
'Greetings. l don't know why
l am sending you this letter'

569
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:26,630
'l know l have no right on you'

570
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,850
'No right to tell you my woes'

571
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:35,520
'For 2000 takkas, my mother
is selling me to the Kotwal'

572
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,600
'l am against this alliance'

573
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:41,630
'You are a poet. You understand pain'

574
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,040
'Won't you help me?'

575
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,930
'Right now, when everyone, young and old,
is showering me with advice...'

576
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,030
'l seek recourse in your couplets'

577
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,200
'What friendship is this?'

578
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:58,480
'l have no one with whom
to share my sorrow'

579
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,670
'Yours, Chaudvin'

580
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,240
What reply do l give?

581
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,380
Say l got the letter.
Leave the reply to fate.

582
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,250
Alright.

583
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:57,970
Welcome Mirza! You are not
to be seen here these days.

584
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,160
You hardly come here.

585
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:07,590
What do l say?
You need money to come here.

586
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,300
You don't have to worry about money.

587
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,770
Write one more couplet.
There will be money.

588
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,020
lt is not that, l have the money.

589
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,020
Let's see what happens. Whenever
l've played in my name, l've lost.

590
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:26,800
l'll play in someone
else's name today.

591
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,880
- Six!
- lt's six!

592
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:49,060
- ln whose name do you play?
- A lover's.

593
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,440
Fittan, what happened?
Where were you?

594
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,880
Did you give him the letter?

595
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,070
Did he throw it away?
Did he tear it up?

596
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,690
- No.
- Did he give a reply?

597
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:20,990
Oh yes he did.
He said leave the reply to fate.

598
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,930
- He didn't say anything else?
- No madam.

599
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,220
No?

600
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,450
Nausha, you were not like this.

601
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,010
What is this? No one leaves
the game after winning.

602
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:49,730
You are nuts. ln fact, a loser
doesn't leave the game.

603
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:54,660
-l won't let you leave like that.
-No Naushad, l have to go.

604
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,440
Alright then, on one condition.

605
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:01,510
Promise you will play
a game with me again.

606
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,900
- l accept that.
- Good night then.

607
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,620
Madam, the marriage procession
has left the groom's home.

608
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:34,360
What? And we are not yet ready.

609
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,170
Wonder where all the girls are.

610
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,730
Even l won't help when they
are getting married.

611
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,970
How much can a lone woman do?

612
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,820
The story is over.

613
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:48,660
l had thought of such a long story...

614
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,140
that listeners will stay awake,
listening with rapt attention.

615
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,890
And l only will fall
asleep narrating it.

616
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,900
Fittan!

617
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:28,180
Damn! Go some place else with
that lime, you fatso!

618
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,400
You made me sober with it.

619
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:35,490
- You also lick some.
- Get lost!

620
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,960
Where is my opium box?

621
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,760
- Take.
- Get lost!

622
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,370
What nonsense is this!
Give that to me!

623
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:22,860
- No.
- Madam, madam! Come quickly!

624
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:27,210
You have my promise, don't stop me.
Release my hand.

625
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,130
Have you gone crazy?

626
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,990
Yes, l have. l won't marry
that wolf! Leave me.

627
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,230
- What happened?
- Take care of your bride.

628
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,800
She was taking opium.

629
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,910
Oh my God! What were
you going to do?

630
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,080
How was l to know you
loved Mirza so much.

631
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,420
l don't want to live.

632
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,030
l'm sorry, dear. l am
your mother after all.

633
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,160
Consider my age. Damn that Kotwal!

634
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,020
Damn his money and jewelry.

635
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,780
Fittan, go stop the
marriage procession.

636
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,620
- But it has already left.
- So what? Stop it wherever it is.

637
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:13,740
l don't want any marriage,
l want my daughter.

638
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,690
Move! l'll go myself
and stop that rascal.

639
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,610
- Madam.
- Mirza!

640
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:29,890
You have come!
How nice you are!

641
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,980
How nice you are, too,
that you're selling your daughter.

642
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,870
Your hapless child. Being a mother,
you are selling her to a rascal.

643
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,990
- That's not true, Mirza.
- Why are you lying?

644
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,110
What plea is this letter making?

645
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,600
What does that marriage
procession prove?

646
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,850
My poverty, my helplessness.

647
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:55,260
l was in debt, and was forced
to sell my daughter to repay it.

648
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,580
Money is the root cause
of all problems.

649
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,730
Here's the money.

650
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,260
So that no one says that
an innocent woman...

651
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,920
had to sell herself for money.

652
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,010
Or that a mother sold her affection.

653
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,030
There is none like you, Mirza.

654
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,730
l had already made the decision.

655
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,290
You go yourself and give
the good news to Chaudvin.

656
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,350
l don't have the courage.

657
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:42,090
- l have come.
- Go away! l said go away!

658
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,360
l don't even want to see your face!

659
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:50,660
Seeing a woman helpless,
you want to buy her with money.

660
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,850
l belong to the one
l was destined for.

661
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:56,500
Go away from here!

662
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:01,760
- What happened?
- No one bothered to listen to me.

663
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:03,690
Oh my God! What do l do now?

664
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,990
What happened, Moti? Why
did you turn Mirza away?

665
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,820
Yes, l sent Mirza to you.

666
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,883
That was Mirza?
My fate be damned!

667
01:04:51,907 --> 01:04:53,930
l thought it was the Kotwal.

668
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,250
Mother, call him back.
Don't let Mirza go.

669
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,280
What nonsense is this!

670
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,780
What do you mean by shouting
Mirza's name in the street like that?

671
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,310
- Come in!
- Leave me!

672
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,390
How dare you shout Mirza's name!

673
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:27,650
l won't spare you!
l won't spare you today!

674
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,420
Come!

675
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,120
l won't spare you!

676
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,320
Move aside! She belongs to me!

677
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,420
l have bought her!

678
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,670
The writing has not even
dried on the paper yet.

679
01:05:55,130 --> 01:06:00,080
Here's your writing, your
clothes, your jewelry!

680
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:04,570
- We don't give a damn for it.
-Do you know what you're saying?

681
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,620
You dare to invite me home
and then humiliate me?

682
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:10,570
Don't act smart with me.
l've set many like you straight!

683
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:14,070
- l am the Kotwal!
- That doesn't scare me.

684
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,250
The king is bigger than Kotwal,
and Allah bigger than the king.

685
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,190
- Just try something!
- Such daring?

686
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:25,300
Don't assume l will leave quietly
after such humiliation.

687
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,450
Even your father will leave!

688
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,340
l swear, l will teach you...

689
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:36,950
your daughter,
and that Mirza a lesson!

690
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,900
The Hazrat Khan is not my name!
Remember that!

691
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,150
Get lost. Do whatever you like.

692
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:50,270
Mother! Mother! l have got life
again! l have got life again!

693
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:08,810
l was reminded of our
first meeting again

694
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:16,300
My heart complained again

695
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:23,460
l was reminded of our
first meeting again

696
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:40,620
l had barely escaped one misfortune...

697
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:58,290
when l was reminded of you again

698
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:05,430
l was reminded of our
first meeting again

699
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:25,720
Life would pass by anyway

700
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:40,230
Why was l reminded of meeting you?

701
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:47,480
l was reminded of our
first meeting again

702
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:04,450
My thoughts keep going back to you

703
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:21,910
My heart didn't want to,
yet it searched out those memories

704
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:29,320
l was reminded of our
first meeting again

705
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:36,600
My heart complained again

706
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,150
- Disgusting!
- What's the matter, wife?

707
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,060
Nothing.

708
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:46,500
How much you have started drinking!

709
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,940
Now l feel, we will be bathed
in liquor after we die.

710
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,500
Okay, l won't drink.
Please fill my hookah.

711
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:03,120
No man can't be that decent.
No betel leaf or hookah.

712
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,570
That is what l am saying.
There isn't a penny at home.

713
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,810
And you even spent
what little there was on liquor.

714
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,660
There's nothing more
at home to sell.

715
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:13,700
God forbid! What are you saying!

716
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,970
God only knows, l never complain.

717
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,120
But l have to speak when
things get out of hand.

718
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,170
Your behavior has made me bold.

719
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,800
Mathuradas, the money lender, is here.

720
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:33,220
- Go, now deal with him too.
- How do l deal with him now?

721
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:39,170
- What will happen now?
- Whatever Allah wills.

722
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,360
Does your Allah will anything good?

723
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,310
Come in, Mathuradas.

724
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

725
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,670
You have come so early
in the morning?

726
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,160
The interest amount will only
increase with the days.

727
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:15,760
Not adding in today,
the total is now Rs.279O.

728
01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:20,170
- Please clear my account now.
- How do l clear it?

729
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,250
l cannot wait any longer.

730
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,460
Better clear my account, or
l'll go and meet Mr. Kale...

731
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,070
Wait Mathuradas.

732
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:31,710
'Keep your honor intact, Mir'

733
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,550
'This is Delhi, not some
other small town'

734
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:41,910
'l am a poor man, how will
l repay your money?'

735
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,350
'The only property l
have is these poems.'

736
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:52,440
'A few woven words,
a few praises of women...'

737
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,000
'this is all one will get
from my home after l die.'

738
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,840
Take these.

739
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,950
You must be joking.

740
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,270
This poetry is worthless
in the market.

741
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:08,707
You are right.
Poetry is worthless

742
01:12:08,731 --> 01:12:10,780
in this money-minded world.

743
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:15,990
Take them to the king's court.
Maybe you will get Rs.3OO-4OO.

744
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,980
His poetry is not for sale, sir.

745
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,940
Take these bangles for now.
When Allah gives us money...

746
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:24,260
we'll repay your money too.

747
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,110
No wife, please don't
kill my ego like that.

748
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,690
No sister-in-law, l may be a money
lender, but l'm not hard hearted.

749
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,720
l had only come to remind
Mirza of his duty.

750
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,980
Let me know when you can
arrange some money.

751
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,740
lf you need more money,
l can lend you some.

752
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:46,840
- l have no words to thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

753
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,620
l'll take your leave. Good day.

754
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,790
Tell your wife not to
worry about the loan.

755
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,880
- Are you Mathuradas, the money lender?
- No.

756
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:34,270
Wait!

757
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:40,590
l forgot my name. My name is
Mathuradas, and l am a money lender.

758
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,320
You have been called to
the police station.

759
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:45,590
Police station? Me? No!
lt must be someone else.

760
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,710
- What for?
- You'll learn that over there.

761
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,310
- At the police station.
- Spare me, l prefer to go home.

762
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,540
l am no thief, nor related to one.

763
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:02,480
Leave me! l am innocent. l have
committed no theft or heist.

764
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:06,440
l didn't elope with any woman.
l am a decent family man.

765
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:07,830
Walk in!

766
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,190
- He's the money lender, sir.
- l'm a money lender.

767
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:16,230
Don't be afraid, you haven't been
called here as an accused...

768
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,470
but only for questioning.

769
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:23,410
- Please be seated.
- Move back! l told you l'm innocent.

770
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:27,300
The Kotwal is a just man.

771
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:31,950
- Tell me sir, how can l help you?
- Sit down.

772
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,730
You all leave.

773
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:36,480
- Tell me something.
- Yes?

774
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:40,470
Have you lent money
to Mirza on interest?

775
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,040
- No.
- No?

776
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:50,450
Yes, l did. But that's
not a crime, sir.

777
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:54,480
Not at all. But you even
take interest from Mirza.

778
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,360
Does anyone lend money
without interest?

779
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,076
There's a limit to the
amount of interest.

780
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,520
Show me your account book

781
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:07,110
A little more is charged here.

782
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,630
But if l can even get
the principal amount...

783
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:11,770
l'll waive the interest.

784
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:17,400
lf that's the case, take the
money Mirza owes you from me.

785
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,390
Sell the paper you have
in his name to me.

786
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:28,260
- But...
- Don't worry, Mirza is my friend.

787
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,310
l don't want anyone to trouble
him for repayment of money.

788
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,470
That's a very kind thought, sir.

789
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:39,710
lt makes no difference to me
who l get the money from.

790
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:41,810
This is Mirza's account paper.

791
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,460
- Go and collect the money.
- Thank you. Good day.

792
01:15:48,930 --> 01:15:50,350
l'll take revenge!

793
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:56,620
l'll ruin him, or l won't consider
myself worthy of my name!

794
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:03,770
Mirza Ghalib, son of Abdullah
Khan Baig, be present!

795
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:14,310
Accused, just admit or deny...

796
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,880
that you have to repay
Mathuradas a loan...

797
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,150
the record of which...

798
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,970
the city police chief,
Hasmat Khan, has bought.

799
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:26,060
Yes sir, l admit.

800
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:32,690
And despite repeated reminders,
you could not repay the loan?

801
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:34,170
Yes sir.

802
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:36,330
And the payment is
six months overdue?

803
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,850
Yes sir.

804
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:43,140
The court orders the accused
to repay the plaintiff...

805
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:48,070
Rs.2000 by this evening and
get the paper released.

806
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:54,350
lf he fails to do so, the accused
will be imprisoned for six months.

807
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:57,310
You didn't even give
me a day's time, sir.

808
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,500
The court's decision is final.

809
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:02,380
l can't repay that
under any circumstances.

810
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,200
Even if l sell everything l have...

811
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,160
l won't be able to collect Rs.2OOO.

812
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,120
Then issue an arrest warrant
in his name, sir.

813
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,110
Wait.

814
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,810
l, Mufti Kadruddin, in my
personal capacity...

815
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:25,340
deposit Rs. 2,000 with the court
from the treasury.

816
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,000
Mufti sir.

817
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,980
The court is adjourned.

818
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:46,410
That was good Mirza sir.
But at least tell me...

819
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,470
what did you do
with so much money?

820
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:50,410
What do l say?

821
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,110
'l used to take loans and drink...'

822
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:59,840
'assuming my poetry would
bring me success one day'

823
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:06,690
Mr. Mufti, you have
obliged me today.

824
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,610
l can't thank you enough..

825
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,300
Don't say that. l am not so good.
Even l need a favor.

826
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,940
What favor can you expect
from this poor man?

827
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,950
My brother's son is
getting married.

828
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,560
There will be music
and a poetry recital too.

829
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,030
Such a huge bribe for
such a small favor?

830
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,330
My friends have increased my worth.

831
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,600
What do we do?
We fear your annoyance.

832
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:36,190
Your poetry was not appreciated
in the royal court...

833
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:37,230
so you stopped going there.

834
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:39,710
You don't even participate
in poetry recitals.

835
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,490
So l didn't mind doing
you this small favor.

836
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,520
- Do come.
- Thank you for the invitation.

837
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,500
Thanks for accepting.

838
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,100
Friends, the ladies
have requested...

839
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:03,570
that Mirza Nausha recite his poetry.

840
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:06,020
'l may not love, l may be rude'

841
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:07,630
Go ahead!

842
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:12,680
lt's an old poem, yet,
l'll accept your request.

843
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,890
l recite...

844
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:25,130
l may not love, l may be rude

845
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:29,000
'l may not love, l may be rude'

846
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:38,750
l may be rude, you may be famous

847
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:53,010
Don't talk to me,
or have anything to do with me

848
01:20:53,550 --> 01:21:00,490
lf you've no other feelings,
l'll even accept your hatred

849
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,000
'lf you've no other feelings,
l'll even accept your hatred'

850
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,600
The third couplet is...

851
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:16,860
Wait, l forgot.

852
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,680
'My being is so...'

853
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,470
Oh Allah!

854
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,140
Why did you speak out?

855
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,550
Pardon me madam...

856
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:32,310
but hearing his poetry you said
'wow', and my heart sighed.

857
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:39,700
Why is my presence defaming?

858
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,960
Even if it's not a convention,
but a creation of the world

859
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,010
This is for a Ghalib supporter.

860
01:21:53,240 --> 01:22:00,740
Even l am not an enemy

861
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:14,040
Even though a stranger
may love you

862
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:26,780
Even though l'm a very loyal man...

863
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:32,170
you may not love me,
but may consider me a nuisance

864
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,500
Mirza sir!

865
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:36,270
What is this girl up to?

866
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:40,890
l will go to the heights

867
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:46,820
Even though being indifferent
may be your habit

868
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:52,650
Even though inexpressible

869
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,860
Even though unfulfilled,
at least l have the desire

870
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,680
- Mr. Mufti, l'll be going.
- What's wrong, Mirza?

871
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,280
l am not feeling well.
Please excuse me.

872
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:10,020
Madam, pardon me,
but l want to leave.

873
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,090
Where are you going?

874
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:14,710
l paid you 50 takkas and you
may leave only if you return the money.

875
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:20,910
Take this. l'm sorry,
but l'm not feeling well.

876
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,210
Mirza sir! Mirza sir!

877
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:46,980
Mirza sir!

878
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:50,980
- Chaudvin madam, you?
- Yes, it's me.

879
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:56,800
l always call you,
and you always ignore my call.

880
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:03,830
lt's not that, l myself
wanted to meet you.

881
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,450
l wanted to congratulate
you on your marriage.

882
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:13,690
Yes Mirza, if you won't,
who else will?

883
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,610
What do you mean?
Didn't you get married?

884
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:20,220
Yes, l'm married, but not to Kotwal.

885
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:22,410
Not to Kotwal?

886
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:26,750
Then who?

887
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,380
You ask me that?

888
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:37,490
Believe me Mirza,
l was living on your name.

889
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:48,050
But unfortunately, whenever we drew
close, destiny separated us.

890
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,570
That night when you came,
l thought you were Hashmat.

891
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:53,340
And was so rude to you.

892
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,390
But when l realized it was
my beloved who had come...

893
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,700
and who was so close to me...

894
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,950
l, the unfortunate one, didn't
even extend my hand towards him.

895
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:09,180
Then l tried hard, but...

896
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,540
Why did you want to try hard for me?

897
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:18,310
l am a useless, worthless fellow.

898
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:23,420
l only compose poetry,
which no one likes.

899
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:26,430
Don't say that in my presence.

900
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:30,340
Your poetry, and you mean
everything to me.

901
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,900
Don't say that.
Don't make me a sinner.

902
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,020
My heart and brain have already
created a dilemma for me.

903
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,360
My heart draws me
towards you, and...

904
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:41,060
l don't want anything else.

905
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,980
l have found what l want.

906
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:50,650
l have only one wish.
Come to my house once, just once!

907
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:54,430
Let me also experience
how a bride feels...

908
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,080
when the groom she desires
comes to take her.

909
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,240
How she dies with happiness!

910
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:04,510
Chaudhvin, l'll come.
l'll come tomorrow.

911
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:11,020
Tomorrow! Really? Do come.

912
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,500
l will wait for you.

913
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,960
Why is it, dear, you are sending me out
all dressed up today?

914
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,910
l want others to like you
the way l like you.

915
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:55,770
What others? Do you know
where l'm going?

916
01:26:56,310 --> 01:27:00,560
What do l know? l only know
you're leaving the house.

917
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,160
Yes.

918
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,970
You're crying?

919
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:28,060
No.

920
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:31,090
My eyes just welled up.

921
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:33,640
They don't shed for no reason.

922
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:36,560
Heat gathers.

923
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,770
Heat rises and collects in the sky.

924
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:44,580
What pains you?

925
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,780
Not pain, regret...

926
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:53,770
l couldn't make a place
for myself in your heart.

927
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,490
l couldn't be the inspiration
for your poetry.

928
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:03,380
Since l married you,
you've been having problems.

929
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:12,610
A child is the bond with which
a wife binds her husband.

930
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:16,240
l couldn't even provide that bond.

931
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:25,370
- lf you heed, may l say something?
- Yes.

932
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:34,420
- Marry again.
- Wife ... no ... no!

933
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:44,060
Allah, what do l do? One stood
by me, one stole my heart.

934
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:48,280
One is an idol of devotion,
the other, full of love.

935
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:50,500
No!

936
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:11,120
Oh heart, what has happened to you?

937
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:18,760
What is the cure to this ailment?

938
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:26,110
Oh heart, what has happened to you?

939
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:42,640
l am desirous, and he is regretful

940
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:57,690
Oh Allah, what is all this about?

941
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:05,080
Oh heart, what has happened to you?

942
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:19,240
Even l can speak

943
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:33,600
l wish you would ask
what the matter is

944
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:40,950
Oh heart, what has happened to you?

945
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:57,120
l expect loyalty from the one

946
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:12,140
Who doesn't understand loyalty?

947
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:19,400
Oh heart, what has happened to you?

948
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:33,320
l love you very much

949
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:47,740
l don't know who God is

950
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:54,880
Oh heart, what has happened to you?

951
01:31:54,950 --> 01:32:05,460
What is the cure for this ailment?

952
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,600
Moti. Mo...

953
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:21,100
Mirza.

954
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,700
- Didn't Mirza come?
- He's not going to come.

955
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,230
You wait for him needlessly.

956
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:32,530
You love such a heartless man
who doesn't even care for you.

957
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:35,880
lt's not that, mother.
l know why he didn't come.

958
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:38,680
Since he has been ridiculed
at the royal court...

959
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:43,310
he feels dejected. He has lost
interest in everything.

960
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,500
Moti! Moti!

961
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,160
There's going to be
a grand procession tomorrow.

962
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,310
Won't you come with us? Mirza
Shahrukh will come in a palanquin.

963
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:55,160
He will be dressed in full glory.

964
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:57,350
Even the King will join
the procession.

965
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:01,260
The King? Mother, even l
will join the procession.

966
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:04,180
l will sing and dance there.

967
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:06,640
l'll tell the King what
a great poet Mirza is.

968
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:11,350
Nonsense! Are you a nautch girl
that you will sing and dance?

969
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:15,160
- Have some shame!
- What shame?

970
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,790
My shame is a slave to my husband.

971
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,430
What husband? Which husband?

972
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:22,970
Don't you feel ashamed?
l won't let you go.

973
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,340
l will go! l surely will!

974
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,610
Now come on, Mother!

975
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,680
News has come that
the procession of Hindus...

976
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:02,210
is just a mile away from the temple.

977
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,700
And the Muslims are just one and a
half mile away from the mosque.

978
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:10,490
Hindus and Muslims
are embracing each other.

979
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,450
They are joining
each other's processions.

980
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:22,730
Aren't you feeling well?

981
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,790
Then what's the matter?
You're not speaking.

982
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:29,190
Have l made a mistake?

983
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:34,160
- No, Zeenat.
- Then why are you somber?

984
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,510
Look outside, both the earth
and sky look velvety.

985
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,760
The streams are gushing,
gardens are blooming...

986
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,630
birds are singing.

987
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:49,000
Shall l call the dancers
to entertain you?

988
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,800
Want to hear the Malhar (song)?

989
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:55,170
No Zeenat, l don't feel like
doing anything today.

990
01:34:55,630 --> 01:35:01,240
lf the King feels like that,
what will become of his subjects?

991
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,390
l'm thinking the same.

992
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,880
My ancestors ruled here, widened
the boundaries of their kingdom.

993
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:11,410
Now the kingdom has become
a slave to another country.

994
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:17,370
l am wondering if this rejoicing
will continue after us.

995
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,300
Or will it become history?

996
01:35:23,670 --> 01:35:27,020
lt is true, only Allah's
name continues.

997
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:33,290
Please leave now.
l want to be left alone.

998
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:35,640
As you wish.

999
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:42,150
What is the matter, Queen?

1000
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,830
You are crying?

1001
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,690
What do l do?

1002
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:50,280
Today, l've seen the Emperor in
a mood that l've never seen before.

1003
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,790
He is totally depressed. l tried
to cheer him in a hundred ways...

1004
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,640
but it didn't work.

1005
01:35:57,470 --> 01:36:00,100
What happened to these girls?
Let them dance, sing.

1006
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:02,040
Perhaps that will cheer him.

1007
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:42,160
Make a bungalow for me
on the banks of the Ganga

1008
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,260
May you be blessed, my beloved

1009
01:36:58,790 --> 01:37:02,790
Plant a garden right
outside my window

1010
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,010
l'll get to see flowers

1011
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,050
May you be blessed, my beloved

1012
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:40,350
Let's lock our eyes
and talk of love

1013
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:46,620
Let my anklets tinkle
with your flute

1014
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:00,210
Just you and me and no one else

1015
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:06,190
May you be blessed, my beloved

1016
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:40,520
lt needs a lifetime
for a sigh to affect

1017
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:55,300
Who will live until
your tresses grey?

1018
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:09,870
Love unlimited, and desires desperate

1019
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:23,880
What do l do with my heart
until my love is noticed?

1020
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,100
Until my love is noticed?

1021
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:55,300
Agreed you won't leave me, but...

1022
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:09,750
l will die by the time
you realize l love you

1023
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:20,140
Wonderful! Who is this girl?

1024
01:40:20,660 --> 01:40:25,220
She's the daughter of a slave.
Her name is Chaudvin Begum.

1025
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:30,450
Her voice is melodious,
her song beyond compare!

1026
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:38,350
No one has a cure to my sorrow

1027
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:52,160
A flame has to burn until dawn

1028
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:06,370
lt needs a lifetime
for a sigh to affect

1029
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:39,550
l heard your song, Chaudvin Begum.
lt really pleased me.

1030
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,540
Here is a reward for you.

1031
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:51,960
King, l am not worthy
of this honor.

1032
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:55,500
The one whose composition
l sang is worthy of it.

1033
01:41:56,390 --> 01:42:01,130
l am just the shadow, he is
the body. Mirza Ghalib.

1034
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:13,930
Oh great! Attendant, go in the
evening with my message to Mirza.

1035
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:17,070
Ask him not to be so annoyed...

1036
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:19,630
and to come and attend court.

1037
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,370
Mirza, l am pleased that you came.

1038
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:39,470
Since you left, and until
your return today...

1039
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:43,000
l have been admiring your poetry.

1040
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:48,950
Appreciating your poetry
and style...

1041
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:55,830
in addition to a reward,
l'll also confer a title upon you.

1042
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:59,150
From today, you are the
Royal Poet of the court.

1043
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:01,740
l will recite your poetry
in the royal court.

1044
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,820
Oh King, how do l thank
you for this honor?

1045
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:26,460
l and my descendents will
forever be grateful to you.

1046
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:30,980
'May you live a 1000 years'

1047
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,710
'May every year have 50000 days'

1048
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:43,590
Congratulations!

1049
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,190
Serve me sweets today.

1050
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:52,430
Will you say something,
or just ask for sweets?

1051
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:54,370
Tell me, what is it?

1052
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:02,200
The King has conferred
a title upon your Mirza.

1053
01:44:02,970 --> 01:44:04,050
Really?

1054
01:44:04,090 --> 01:44:08,440
Yes, and rewarded him
with loads of money.

1055
01:44:08,970 --> 01:44:12,970
He gifted him silver bowls,
promised him a monthly allowance...

1056
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,310
and also declared him
tutor of the Prince.

1057
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:19,580
Thank you Allah!

1058
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:24,380
And do you know how all this
became possible? Because of you.

1059
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:31,550
Don't say that. lt is his compositions
which the world likes.

1060
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:33,420
lt is God's gift.

1061
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:40,590
l pray that he is more successful.
l will celebrate! l will sing!

1062
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:45,990
Now he will surely come to us.
Then you celebrate and sing.

1063
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:54,480
l will decorate the house.
l will feed the poor.

1064
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:56,720
l will do so much!

1065
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:59,930
l knew this would happen one day.

1066
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,710
- But first thank that person too.
- Who?

1067
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,920
The one who praised you
before the Emperor.

1068
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:09,190
That's where l'm going.
- God be with you. - God be with you.

1069
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,920
l will leave too.

1070
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:13,830
- Come on Mukku Miyan.
- Where sir?

1071
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,860
- But sir...
- Oh...

1072
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,360
Oh, dear.

1073
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,190
Oh. You are so happy
that you are crying?

1074
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,250
Enough. A woman's name is crying.

1075
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:39,380
Crying in sorrow,
crying in happiness.

1076
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:42,920
Mirza. God has heard my prayers.

1077
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:50,140
l hope you will still let
me stay at your feet.

1078
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:53,660
Why do you talk like that?
You are my wife.

1079
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:57,980
- Then come home.
- Home? Yes of course.

1080
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:03,990
Lift the palanquin.

1081
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:19,360
'Nazm-ud-Daulah', 'Dabir-ul-Mulk',
Nizam-E-Jung'! Naushad Ali!

1082
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,960
What have you
thought about Mirza?

1083
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:25,830
l have been wracking my brains,
but can't think of a thing.

1084
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:30,330
Of course you can't. Your efforts
won't blow out this flame now.

1085
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:33,980
lt's not that sir, l
am trying my best.

1086
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:35,580
Best indeed!

1087
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:40,680
- Sir, we have made some arrests.
- Put them all behind bars!

1088
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:44,010
- Present them at court tomorrow!
- Yes, sir. Come on!

1089
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:49,420
Move, move!

1090
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:56,960
- l've got an idea, sir!
- What?

1091
01:47:01,090 --> 01:47:06,130
Alright, you throw the bait,
l'll set the trap.

1092
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,850
- Listen.
- Yes?

1093
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,160
Your nephew, Arif,
is coming home.

1094
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:22,200
Should we adopt him?
You can call someone your son.

1095
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:25,660
No, l am scared.

1096
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:30,980
Whoever l hold dear, l lose him.

1097
01:47:32,590 --> 01:47:34,650
l don't want any calamity
to befall Arif.

1098
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:37,730
Don't talk such nonsense.

1099
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,880
Then do as you please.
Who could be happier than l?

1100
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,550
We'll have a grown up son,
For what more can we ask?

1101
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,550
l will become a father and
grandfather without any trouble.

1102
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:50,680
You will become a mother and
grandmother without any pain.

1103
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:53,730
- Naughty!
- l'm leaving.

1104
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:02,340
Yes sir.

1105
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:05,900
Wow! What lovely flowers.

1106
01:48:08,570 --> 01:48:11,690
'l won't stop worshiping that idol'

1107
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:16,600
'Even if l'm called an atheist'

1108
01:48:19,010 --> 01:48:21,210
- Let's go.
- Where?

1109
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:23,600
Where l've been trying
to go for so long.

1110
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:26,440
lt's time for Arif to come.

1111
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:30,000
Yes Mirza, it's time you
kept your promise.

1112
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,710
The game is waiting for you.
Let's finish it today.

1113
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:43,200
Today? Not today, Naushad Ali.
Can't you wait until tomorrow?

1114
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,180
Sorry for being rude, but
who has seen tomorrow?

1115
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:50,570
This is a promise, you'll
have to keep it today.

1116
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:55,450
Alright.

1117
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:06,700
- Mirza didn't come.
- He won't come either.

1118
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:08,690
Don't you understand yet?

1119
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:14,760
You did so much for him,
you even invited slurs.

1120
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:17,050
But with what results?
You are where you were.

1121
01:49:17,650 --> 01:49:21,190
No mother, you don't understand
the heart of a poet.

1122
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,360
He makes dear ones cry, so that
he can make others laugh.

1123
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,810
He burns himself to brighten
other people's worlds.

1124
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:33,580
l am sure he will come,
he will surely come once.

1125
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:36,140
He will keep his promise.

1126
01:49:37,350 --> 01:49:41,560
- Let's stake Rs.1OO.
- No, Rs.5O.

1127
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:48,230
You think my pockets are empty.
Here, satisfy yourself.

1128
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:50,390
This is my allowance.

1129
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:55,200
But listen, don't cheat.

1130
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:57,920
l'll use all the tricks to win the game.

1131
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:03,170
Should l throw a winning number?

1132
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:05,960
- Why are you looking outside?
- No reason.

1133
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:12,590
l am not sitting here to lose.
Throw the dice.

1134
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:23,630
Hello Mirza. What's going
on here, Naushad Ali?

1135
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,080
Nothing sir, we were playing.

1136
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:37,820
And even the Mirza Ghalib was.

1137
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,000
But in the eyes of law, both horse
and donkey are the same.

1138
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:45,480
Mind your tongue!

1139
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:47,760
Don't be rude, Mr. Mirza.

1140
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:50,700
Mr. Khan we won't make
such a mistake again.

1141
01:50:51,150 --> 01:50:53,280
What mistake? Who is
making the mistake?

1142
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:57,260
You! Pick up everything,
and even bring Mirza along.

1143
01:50:58,230 --> 01:51:01,720
- Pardon us, Kotwal.
- l understand everything!

1144
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:06,610
Naushad is your ally. But don't
think you will escape.

1145
01:51:07,230 --> 01:51:09,490
Conspiring against someone
is also a crime.

1146
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,290
Handcuff him! And bring him along!

1147
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:33,490
Hey, that's Mirza!

1148
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:36,540
- Mirza Nausha?
- Under arrest?

1149
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:48,170
'Nazm-ud-Daulah', 'Dabir-ul-Mulk',
Nizam-E-Jung'!

1150
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:58,850
- Fittan, don't you want a betel leaf?
- No, damn you!

1151
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:05,110
Oh God! Mirza Nausha!

1152
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:14,530
- Madam! Mirza!
- Mirza has come!

1153
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,780
Mirza has come?

1154
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,260
Mother!

1155
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,400
- Oh my God!
- Take him away!

1156
01:52:38,650 --> 01:52:41,000
What happened, Mirza?
Let him go!

1157
01:52:44,030 --> 01:52:47,530
Let go a gambler? A man who breaks
the law in broad daylight?

1158
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:52,110
- Move aside!
- l plead with you, Kotwal.

1159
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:54,190
l beg at your feet!

1160
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:58,360
You had asked me to come to
your house once. l have come.

1161
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,840
l had not asked you
to come like this.

1162
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:07,040
Let him go, Kotwal.
Don't take out your anger on him.

1163
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:08,880
Move aside...

1164
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,790
or even you'll be arrested
for obstructing us.

1165
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:14,970
Arrest me. Say whatever you
like to me, but let him go!

1166
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:16,830
Or take me along, too.

1167
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:23,570
l had come as a groom
to this house. And he.

1168
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:25,740
Move!

1169
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:33,140
You have beaten my daughter.
Allah will beat you!

1170
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:37,780
Damn you! l curse you!

1171
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:48,820
'l am neither a joyous
song, nor music'

1172
01:53:50,680 --> 01:53:53,290
'l am the voice of my defeat'

1173
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:56,560
Great Mirza! Can't get
over poetry even here?

1174
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:59,700
He'll feel like an
infidel without it.

1175
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:01,560
l hope you're not dejected.

1176
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:06,600
'l am arrested by love'

1177
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:09,710
'The rest lies in the court's hands'

1178
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:16,560
Greetings, uncle.

1179
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:22,920
'How wonderful that l saw you
today. lt's such a joyous day'

1180
01:54:24,610 --> 01:54:26,540
- How are you, Arif?
- l'm fine, uncle.

1181
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:31,360
- How are your wife and child?
- They have sent their greetings.

1182
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:38,190
Give them my regards.
l wish l were present there.

1183
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:42,580
But my being present or not
makes no difference.

1184
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:46,770
Even if l was, l would
spread sorrow.

1185
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:50,950
- Don't lose courage, uncle.
- Everything will be fine, Mirza.

1186
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:55,150
All your friends are
trying their best.

1187
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:03,610
The servant bows at
the Emperor's feet.

1188
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:05,850
l have recognized you.

1189
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:07,970
You are Chaudhvin Begum.

1190
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:10,750
One of Mirza's supporters.

1191
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:13,860
What have you come to say?

1192
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:17,180
l have to beg for the
Emperor's grace.

1193
01:55:17,630 --> 01:55:20,770
l have come to beg
for justice, Emperor.

1194
01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:24,660
Mirza Nausha has been arrested
by the police in a case.

1195
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:27,020
l know, Chaudhvin.

1196
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:31,780
l am as sad about
this as you, probably.

1197
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:37,650
Such atrocity, this injustice.
Please issue an order Emperor...

1198
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:39,920
that Mirza should be
released immediately.

1199
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:44,880
l wish l could do this.

1200
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,570
Emperor!

1201
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,680
Hearing this from me, you would
perhaps be surprised, Chaudhvin.

1202
01:55:52,810 --> 01:55:54,460
But it is all a matter of time.

1203
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:58,710
There was neither a cry,
nor were there any tears.

1204
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:03,220
Hindustan's King's rule is now only
to the banks of the Yamuna.

1205
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:08,800
The area where Mirza was arrested
doesn't fall under me...

1206
01:56:09,550 --> 01:56:11,330
but under the British resident.

1207
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:16,950
At least write a recommendation letter.

1208
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:21,730
l am sure, seeing a royal request,
he will not refuse.

1209
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:26,560
lf that's what you think,
l'll write one for you.

1210
01:56:30,350 --> 01:56:34,500
Oh Allah, l have no words to speak.

1211
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:39,500
l cannot do anything.

1212
01:56:40,190 --> 01:56:42,800
The King has begun to send
me recommendations?

1213
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:45,550
lf the King begins to
interfere with the law...

1214
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:50,110
there won't be any
law and order left.

1215
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:51,870
The King is not interfering.

1216
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:57,500
He has only requested a thorough
investigation in the case.

1217
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:00,020
Mirza is no ordinary
citizen of Delhi.

1218
01:57:00,490 --> 01:57:05,140
Whether he's ordinary or not,
the law applies to everyone.

1219
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:09,100
l don't have to learn what is
the law from you, Kotwal.

1220
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:13,070
The law doesn't say you can provoke
someone into committing a crime...

1221
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:14,630
and then go and nab him.

1222
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:16,740
Pardon me...

1223
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:19,700
but nor does it say that the
criminal should be left alone...

1224
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:21,150
if he's committed a crime.

1225
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:24,500
What criminal? Who is the criminal?

1226
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:30,920
The criminal is Naushad Ali.
And wasn't he a man sent by you?

1227
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:34,470
No, he was sir, but...

1228
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,920
A crime, provoked or not...

1229
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:40,420
crime is crime.

1230
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:43,920
You may go gentlemen.

1231
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:59,400
- What did he mean?
- That Mirza won't be released.

1232
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:04,410
- You may leave now.
- l will leave, Hashmat.

1233
01:58:05,650 --> 01:58:10,220
But remember, you'll die a dog's
death for these lies and cheating.

1234
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:13,050
No one will even offer water
when you're dying.

1235
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,400
You will have to pay for every
deed in Allah's court.

1236
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:39,730
The law is your friend.
You are the Messiah of the poor

1237
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:47,010
Whoever comes to your door,
never returns empty handed

1238
01:58:54,810 --> 01:59:03,690
lf you desire, a ruined home
can glow with happiness again

1239
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:13,360
A helpless man can be
absolved of sorrows

1240
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:22,690
l bow my head in obeisance.
My eyes look at you with hope

1241
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:34,570
My complaints have reached my lips

1242
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:48,410
Oh Lord of the world, look...

1243
01:59:56,040 --> 02:00:00,070
these crazy people have
come to your door

1244
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:23,260
The complaints, too,
have reached the lips

1245
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:46,680
My desires were faltering
in the streets of sorrow...

1246
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:57,250
when suddenly l thought of you

1247
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:12,540
l have brought my prayers
where destinies are made

1248
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:23,600
l have heard in your court,
destinies are made

1249
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:31,190
l have so many woes

1250
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:42,070
At least look at me now.
At least have mercy on me now

1251
02:01:55,430 --> 02:02:00,820
Come out from behind
your curtain and look at me

1252
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:12,490
Where these moths have reached...

1253
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:35,290
my complaints have reached my lips

1254
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:41,850
Oh Lord, had you conferred
the title on my husband...

1255
02:02:43,750 --> 02:02:45,260
that he be disgraced like this?

1256
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,990
ls this why you conferred
such honor on him...

1257
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:49,560
that he languish in jail?

1258
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,210
Madam, who is your husband?

1259
02:02:58,010 --> 02:02:59,370
What do l say?

1260
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:02,000
Mirza Ghalib.

1261
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:07,020
Why madam, do you know him?

1262
02:03:08,410 --> 02:03:12,090
l... l've heard he's a very nice man.

1263
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,690
Very God fearing.

1264
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:17,050
He is God fearing.

1265
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,070
But God doesn't pity him.

1266
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:22,450
What happened?

1267
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:31,430
We were happy together,
when a girl entered my husband's life.

1268
02:03:32,790 --> 02:03:37,230
She ruined him, ruined my home.

1269
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:41,720
Oh God!
lt's also possible, madam...

1270
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:48,310
that poor hapless girl was not
aware of what she was doing.

1271
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:51,790
Love is blind after all.

1272
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:56,150
But when one loves,
one torments one's self.

1273
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:00,630
What love is this that
ruins other's homes...

1274
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:04,990
to make yourself happy?

1275
02:04:06,210 --> 02:04:10,140
lf that girl really loved Mirza,
she would destroy herself...

1276
02:04:10,170 --> 02:04:12,210
before any calamity befell Mirza.

1277
02:04:13,770 --> 02:04:22,340
How can anything that has
come here go wrong?

1278
02:04:22,460 --> 02:04:24,760
l don't ask anything
for myself, Lord.

1279
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:31,760
Please shower your kindness
on this good woman.

1280
02:04:57,330 --> 02:05:01,600
That which has reached here...

1281
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:09,310
The complaints too have
reached the tongue...

1282
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:20,830
Moti, has the case finished?

1283
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:25,990
Yes, mother. lt has finished.

1284
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,680
My life's case.

1285
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:38,260
Moti! Moti! Fittan! Fittan!

1286
02:05:44,250 --> 02:05:47,060
Mother, what wrong have l done?

1287
02:05:48,270 --> 02:05:50,670
Why is everything going against me?

1288
02:05:51,370 --> 02:05:55,810
- lt's nothing like that.
- l won't live here now, Mother.

1289
02:05:57,190 --> 02:06:00,000
l feel everything in Delhi
is after my life.

1290
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:05,990
Take me away from here.
l won't live in Mirza's Delhi.

1291
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:09,910
- Where do l take you?
- Take me anywhere, Mother.

1292
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:14,050
Death is beckoning me.

1293
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:39,320
Let's go and live in such a place
now where there is no one

1294
02:06:39,750 --> 02:06:50,510
Where there is no friend,
no one to talk to

1295
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:56,420
Let's go and live in such a place

1296
02:07:07,510 --> 02:07:18,150
Make a home without doors or walls

1297
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:40,360
And there should be no
relatives or well wishers

1298
02:07:40,670 --> 02:07:45,770
Let's go and live in such a place

1299
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:02,390
lf l fall sick, there should
be no one to look after me

1300
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:30,480
And if l die, there should
be no one to bury me

1301
02:08:30,620 --> 02:08:41,280
Let's go and live in such a place
now where there is no one

1302
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:16,320
Congratulations on your
release, Mirza.

1303
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:20,960
Thank you. What do
l gift you, Jailer?

1304
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:26,230
l have only this left now.
Some scented snuff.

1305
02:09:26,550 --> 02:09:28,260
Even that is enough from you, Mirza.

1306
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:31,440
Like the fragrance
of this snuff...

1307
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:34,030
your glory will one day spread
throughout the whole world.

1308
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:37,090
Take, give it to someone you love.

1309
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:39,690
l'll keep some for myself.

1310
02:09:57,240 --> 02:10:00,720
Kallu. Dear.

1311
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:10,560
l do call him, but, oh my
heart full of emotions

1312
02:10:11,570 --> 02:10:15,850
lt should affect him such...

1313
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:20,680
that he cannot stop
himself from coming

1314
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,680
lt should affect him such...

1315
02:10:26,170 --> 02:10:30,730
that he cannot stop
himself from coming

1316
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:44,760
Open the door!
Are you sleeping during the day?

1317
02:10:49,170 --> 02:10:50,530
Who are you, brother?

1318
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:54,720
l am Ghalib. Tell Chaudvin,
Ghalib has come.

1319
02:10:55,110 --> 02:10:57,060
She has left this place.

1320
02:10:58,030 --> 02:11:00,260
Left? Where did she go?

1321
02:11:00,410 --> 02:11:05,240
- God knows!
- God knows!

1322
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:09,910
Now who do l ask where she is?

1323
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:19,740
Hafiz! Do you know where Chaudvin is?

1324
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:23,650
Mirza! Wonder where she went.

1325
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:28,020
She left, and also took along
the recourse of us poor people.

1326
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:32,480
Oh Allah, what do l do now?
Where do l look for her?

1327
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:37,130
l've only heard that a voice is
heard from the square of Mehrauli.

1328
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,840
But when you go near,
it fades away.

1329
02:11:40,410 --> 02:11:41,970
The square in Mehrauli.

1330
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,170
Oh Lord, have mercy.

1331
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:12,800
- Have courage mother.
- What courage?

1332
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:16,480
My daughter has been lying
in bed for the last ten days...

1333
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:18,800
fighting for her life.

1334
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,340
She keeps staring at the door
like she's expecting someone.

1335
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:36,460
This was not my destiny
that l'd see my love

1336
02:12:36,650 --> 02:12:40,710
That l'd live longer if l could wait

1337
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:13,660
l live in the hope you'll
keep your promise

1338
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:23,300
Thereafter, l don't
care even if l die

1339
02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:28,790
l'd die with happiness
if l was sure you'd come

1340
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:31,330
This was not my destiny...

1341
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:34,240
that l'd see my love

1342
02:13:37,020 --> 02:13:40,590
This was not my destiny

1343
02:13:51,010 --> 02:13:53,720
l don't want to be
defamed after l die

1344
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,450
Why don't l just disappear?

1345
02:14:07,480 --> 02:14:12,680
l'll have no burial,
no grave anywhere

1346
02:14:12,970 --> 02:14:18,320
This was not my destiny,
that l'd see my love

1347
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:39,510
Someone ask my heart...

1348
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:45,790
how obsessed it is over love

1349
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:51,330
Why would l have this pain...

1350
02:14:52,950 --> 02:14:57,710
if my love was requited?

1351
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:08,210
l have come, Chaudvin.

1352
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:11,810
Daughter!

1353
02:15:12,160 --> 02:15:13,240
Daughter!

1354
02:15:15,250 --> 02:15:17,120
Chaudhvin! Chaudvin, l have come!

1355
02:15:21,670 --> 02:15:24,250
- My King has come!
- Chaudhvin!

1356
02:15:25,070 --> 02:15:26,420
Chaudvin, l have come!

1357
02:15:27,010 --> 02:15:30,060

1358

Dear!

1359
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:35,010
Chaudhvin.

1360
02:15:37,940 --> 02:15:42,110
- Chaudhvin!
- Dear!

1361
02:15:43,230 --> 02:15:53,740
lt's agreed you won't leave me, but...

1362
02:15:54,960 --> 02:16:03,570
l will die by the time
you realize l love you

1363
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:25,190
Beauty was freed of the
dilemma after my death

1364
02:16:26,140 --> 02:16:40,500
Unfaithfulness is at
peace after my death

1365
02:16:42,550 --> 02:16:52,630
When the flame blows off,
smoke is...

1366
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:58,690
released

1367
02:17:01,220 --> 02:17:13,780
The fire of love died after me

1368
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:28,490
No one dies with such sorrow

1369
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:48,040
Do invigorate loyalty
again after my death

1370
02:17:50,850 --> 02:18:02,940
This humble woman of love has come

1371
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:16,980
Where will this storm of
love go after my death?
