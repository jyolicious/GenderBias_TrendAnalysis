1
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,016
You take it easy.

2
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,989
I will tell you all the details
when my husband comes.

3
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,496
Brother, why have they come?

4
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:13,870
People living in the second plot
of land are troubled by cholera.

5
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,730
People get scared and leave here.

6
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:19,206
They have come to ask the husband for help.
- Another new question!

7
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,873
Mr. Das, after calling the headquarters….

8
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:22,295
...find a way to
treat those people.

9
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,309
I will go today and meet the
people in the second part...

10
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:25,779
...because I won't be coming tomorrow.

11
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,622
Tomorrow is my daughter's
birthday, let's hurry!

12
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:49,393
Listen Charu,
Aunty has not come.

13
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,472
The car that went to pick him up came from the station empty-handed. - What is that?

14
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:56,390
He had said that he would come
to meet us on his way to Kashi.

15
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,105
There must be some important work.

16
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,105
Today is our daughter's first
birthday, but aunty can't come.

17
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,225
The party will be boring without him.
- Yes.

18
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,050
Although we were not related to
Aunty, more than our relatives...

19
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,865
...He loves us.

20
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,254
Now is the time to feed the baby.

21
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,900
Okay then, I'll get
dressed later to take him.

22
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,610
Look at Rama's latest dress

23
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,157
Sha!  It's very beautiful.

24
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:33,723
Today is your daughter's
first birthday, isn't it?

25
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:36,758
No, on your daughter's first birthday.

26
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:39,915
And whose birthday is next year?
- Rama's other birthday.

27
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:42,441
And only on Rama's
birthday every year?

28
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,791
Please wait!  I can't take
care of this one child...

29
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,429
I don't want any more.
- Gentleman!

30
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:52,932
who

31
00:05:54,117 --> 00:05:57,343
what's the problem
- This child, sir

32
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,164
Why what happened to that child?
- What's next?

33
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:02,116
what are you saying
Whose child are you?

34
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:04,097
This is the wife of the husband's worker.

35
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,648
Why didn't he come to work today?

36
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,471
He is dead, man.

37
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:12,424
He and his wife
both died of cholera.

38
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:16,152
Yes, this epidemic is
spreading everywhere.

39
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,764
So what brought this boy here?

40
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:22,400
Now this child has no one, sir.

41
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:25,368
Who will take care of this child?
- If you can sympathize with the husband...

42
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:27,353
No way, guests will come
to our house in a little while.

43
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,526
Go now and come back later.

44
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,519
welcome  - How are you, uncle?

45
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,279
how are you uncle  -
How are you, sister-in-law?

46
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,094
Sha!  Very beautiful.

47
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,087
Aya, take him away.

48
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:07,441
I want an ice cream.
- Okay, I'll get you one.

49
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:09,800
Badal!  Bring an ice cream.

50
00:07:17,986 --> 00:07:18,989
Listen!

51
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:26,231
It's okay, son, don't cry.

52
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:39,104
Get in, lady.

53
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:45,791
bye Bye.

54
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:49,134
why this  What are you still
doing here keeping the child?

55
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:51,077
what's the problem
Whose child is this?

56
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:53,407
These are the children of our worker.

57
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,306
His mother and father
died of cholera this morning.

58
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:57,128
There is nothing I can
do to take him away.

59
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,187
We only have the help of
the husband, gentlemen.

60
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:04,598
Here, take these ten rupees...

61
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:05,810
...and find another home for him.

62
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:09,026
Where should we take this baby, sir?  This
little one belongs to a very low caste.

63
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,683
There is no one of this
child's caste in this village.

64
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,017
Then take it to another village

65
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,752
I am looking for
someone like that, sir, but

66
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,316
until then, who will
take care of this Kelly?

67
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,125
His mother and father are gone...

68
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,082
Little by little, this child will
become food for vultures and foxes.

69
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,261
I was able to save the girl
because I got there on time.

70
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:24,958
Oh my god!

71
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:28,629
Charu, who wants to put this
kind of trouble in the backyard?

72
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,541
As good as they take him.
- Did you mean that?

73
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:36,560
Is it good for those foxes and vultures to take him away? - No, I mean...

74
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:46,174
Come on!  - Yes ma'am?

75
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:50,630
Can you take care of this
child for two or three days?

76
00:08:50,774 --> 00:08:53,094
What's wrong Miss?
Am I in for it?

77
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,372
Take him inside.

78
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,796
Bathe him in hot water...

79
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,750
...put on Rama's old dress.

80
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,861
Keep him in your room.
- Yes, ma'am.

81
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:05,914
You are very kind lady.

82
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:10,780
Find someone of his caste as soon as possible. - Yes sir.

83
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:12,474
It takes two or three days.

84
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,910
I'll come back, sir, I'll come back, lady.
- Good.

85
00:12:15,997 --> 00:12:19,606
Is it Rama or Sujata who is crying?
- Sujata?

86
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,261
Yes, the other child.

87
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:25,163
Oh, did you just name him?

88
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:29,523
why?  Is that a bad name?
- No, not like that.

89
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:33,270
It seems like a meaningless name.

90
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:37,560
That child belongs to a very low
caste, but you named him Sujata.

91
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,709
It just popped into my head.

92
00:12:45,414 --> 00:12:46,842
Who is coming in that cart?

93
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:54,773
Charu!  It must be the aunt.
- Aunt?!

94
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:58,720
how are you aunty  -
Hey, don't jump, kids!

95
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:03,257
The leg is amputated.

96
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:06,182
Because these are my
grandchildren, I have no freedom at all.

97
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:09,924
He is very naughty.
- Both should be blessed.

98
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:11,413
You didn't even come to
Rama's birthday party...

99
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:12,869
...not even sent a letter.

100
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,857
I was ready to come, but I
just looked at Litha and knew...

101
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:19,034
...It was not an auspicious
moment, so I stayed away.

102
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:22,826
He said that it is not good
to travel at such times.

103
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:26,130
Get to know him
Bhavani Shankar Sharma.

104
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:28,061
He is a very knowledgeable priest.

105
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,624
Performing a Chandipat Pooja in the
month in which the girl child was born...

106
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,278
...Good for that kid's future.

107
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,952
That's why I called
him to come with us.

108
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,520
Praise be to the priest.
- Goodbye!

109
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:41,344
This lady did not introduce me properly.

110
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,994
Actually, I am not a priest,
but a professor of English.

111
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,055
I do Chandipat Pujas
because of my passion...

112
00:13:49,298 --> 00:13:51,856
...And those who spend time righteously...

113
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:55,453
...to happiness.

114
00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,084
I've been sick lately.

115
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:02,387
So I thought it would be better if I
went somewhere with a different climate...

116
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,623
...And then he himself
invited me to come here.

117
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,661
That's why I came.  - Very good.

118
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:08,617
Stay here as long as you like.

119
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:15,850
I pray that your fortunes
will improve as well as mine.

120
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:20,080
Like a good son, do I
have water to take a bath?

121
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,525
All this dust is on my body.

122
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:25,515
Go and get him some water to bathe.
- Come on sir.

123
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:27,314
Go with him.  - Okay.

124
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,325
Come in aunty.

125
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,634
Come on, kids.
- Show me the child, what was your name?

126
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:41,040
Rama.
- Rama?  Sha!  It is a very beautiful name.

127
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,169
Wait Charu, I will bring
this river water from God.

128
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:46,984
Come on.

129
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,739
Charu, you know how Aunty is.

130
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,657
He really thinks about that caste.

131
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,673
Tell Aya to keep that child away.
Aunty should not be allowed to see him.

132
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,907
Is this my son's daughter?
Wait, I'll take him over a bit.

133
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:19,040
But... he...
- Do you think about him more than his mother?

134
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,277
Very beautiful,
just like her mother.

135
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,514
Born!  Your daughter is very lucky.

136
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,552
Give him to Aya.
- Your daughter is very beautiful.

137
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:34,062
You will not have to
worry about his marriage.

138
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,967
Look how he laughs with me.

139
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:38,353
Maybe he recognized me.

140
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:55,670
Who can be heard crying inside

141
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,689
Did you have twins?

142
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:02,142
You didn't even tell me that.
- We didn't get twins.

143
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,772
That is our daughter, Rama.
- Then who is this?

144
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,581
Both his mother and
father are dead so we...

145
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,591
But he must be from
a high caste, right?

146
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,693
No, he is low caste.
- Low caste?

147
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:20,657
Eya Upen, I didn't expect
anything like this from you.

148
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:22,778
You belong to a good and important family.
- But aunty...

149
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:23,788
I don't want to hear anything.

150
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:26,068
If I knew, inside this house...

151
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:29,969
...I won't even step foot here
because you are keeping a low caste girl.

152
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,612
Please listen to this aunty...

153
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:34,632
Auntie, now you know the whole story.

154
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,005
Now tell me what you would
do if you were in our place?

155
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:42,260
What I thought was unfair...

156
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,018
...I still see it that way.

157
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:46,293
But aunty it's...
- Upen!

158
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,180
Don't argue with me for having
read an English book or two!

159
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,219
Man, that man is leaving.
- Going to go?

160
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,803
Priest, why what?

161
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,352
what's the problem

162
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,760
All this is God's will.

163
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:13,777
I want to go when I want to go.

164
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,680
Aya told me and I saw
with my own eyes...

165
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:21,625
...that you keep a low
caste child in your house.

166
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,729
That's amazing!
Is that where you're going?

167
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,231
There is nothing surprising about that.

168
00:17:27,668 --> 00:17:30,193
Our religion has...

169
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:32,567
...It is not to catch a
low caste to keep with us.

170
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:35,126
You are a very knowledgeable person.

171
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:40,267
You must know that it is
also said in science - what?

172
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,893
A gas is released from the
bodies of those low castes.

173
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:48,258
It pollutes the bodies and
souls of important people like us.

174
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,985
Have you seen the said gas?

175
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,856
Did you know that food contains vitamins?
- Yes.

176
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:57,390
Have you seen that vitamin?
- No.

177
00:17:57,842 --> 00:18:00,109
Does that mean that
food contains vitamins?

178
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:03,807
OK, I'm going now.

179
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:06,281
You asked me to stay...

180
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:08,508
...But it's my misfortune
that I can't stay longer.

181
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,879
Have a good trip.

182
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,781
The priest got angry and left.

183
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:21,682
Please stop him aunty.
- Now he won't stop when we say so.

184
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:26,089
I know him very well
and he is very pious.

185
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:31,115
I can put up with your
rude behavior but he won't.

186
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,806
What do we do now?

187
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:35,091
Get rid of this problem
as soon as possible.

188
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:38,170
I say this for your own good.

189
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:41,437
I have no problem with that,
I will go to Kashi tomorrow.

190
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:49,794
Why are you so quiet?
- What should I do?

191
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:51,801
I started to feel scared too

192
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,352
Because that priest said about a gas?

193
00:18:54,432 --> 00:19:00,104
No, no, it's not. I
hope we won't suffer.

194
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:02,092
We don't want to suffer...

195
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,236
...But those who do injustice in the
name of religion will suffer the same.

196
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,402
Don't laugh at every question.

197
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:12,467
Aunt also thinks that we will
get rid of this girl's problem soon.

198
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:16,590
Listen, tell the guard
to take him away.

199
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:30,096
Ah, is this Sujata? Nice little kelly. Look at her beauty...
- Aya!

200
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:36,494
Why did you touch him?

201
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:40,059
Ah, if I touch him, will I lose
my caste?  Then I'll take a shower.

202
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,936
No, this is no joke.

203
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:49,920
You are getting too close to him.
- So that's the point?

204
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,162
Don't worry Charu I
have prepared everything.

205
00:19:53,578 --> 00:19:55,456
What did you prepare?
- The guard told me...

206
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,417
...that he found someone
from Sujata's caste.

207
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,687
He will come tomorrow and take Sujata.

208
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,095
Charu, do we have a bamboo shoot in our house?
- Yes why?

209
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,973
Aya told me that Kelly had a little fever.
- Bamboo?

210
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:11,707
A fever is spreading in
this area, take care of him.

211
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,697
Yes, he has a fever.

212
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:24,685
I saw that you also touched him
and now you have to take a bath too.

213
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,742
So you tested me, didn't you?

214
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:41,599
Charu, it's not our fault.

215
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:45,021
People also get closer to the animals they raise.

216
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:47,837
But he is a human child.

217
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:54,044
Will I be able to do my job?

218
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,458
Yes, yes they can.

219
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:07,531
Charu, the guard...

220
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:09,579
...Sujata has brought
a man to give.

221
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:11,421
Mr.

222
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:23,560
Mr

223
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,419
Mr.

224
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:30,964
Hello sir.

225
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,409
I brought someone from the
girl's caste to hand over the child.

226
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:38,282
What should I do?
Tell Aya to bring the child.

227
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:44,737
Come on!  Come on!  Bring that kid.

228
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:02,737
here

229
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:04,323
Take this girl.

230
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,208
What can I do if I
only take this girl?

231
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:13,069
Don't forget what we decided.

232
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:20,500
First I need money, next I need
clothes, I need clothes for washing.

233
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:23,949
Why am I just accepting this girl?

234
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:26,185
Do you think I'm stupid?

235
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,451
listen...

236
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:31,259
are you drunk  - Why...
- Why are you afraid?

237
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:34,756
Tell him I'm drunk, I
drank with my money.

238
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:39,597
Why do I put myself through
this kind of misery without money?

239
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:42,560
Get that drunk off this land!

240
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,434
Guards, take him away!

241
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:48,242
Be a man before
you take a child.

242
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,525
You will spend all the money
given to you on drinking.

243
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,892
Get him out.

244
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:56,321
Take the girl inside again.
- That's right.

245
00:22:59,262 --> 00:23:02,698
That's fine, we can't
give him to a lowly drunk.

246
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,452
But we better give
him to someone soon.

247
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:09,478
He is still a child.
But when he grows up?

248
00:23:10,065 --> 00:23:13,491
No, it is better to stay
away from such relationships.

249
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,304
But where do you put him?

250
00:23:16,132 --> 00:23:17,886
We are going to leave here soon.

251
00:23:18,534 --> 00:23:22,218
Let's find a good family for him

252
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:45,696
Rama!  Sujata!
Come and drink this milk.

253
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:50,554
why did you fall for
me  - You fell yourself.

254
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:54,634
Liar, I won't talk again.
- it's OK.

255
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:56,492
I'm leaving.

256
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,194
Mommy!  Daddy!

257
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:15,074
It will fall down from
there. Go down quickly.

258
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:17,034
Mom!  Dad!

259
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:19,357
Don't be bad kids, go play.

260
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:23,381
Looks like he's back...

261
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,208
...Sujatha has been taught
to call us mom and dad.

262
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,976
Is it true, or is it...

263
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:29,792
...As Rama says, mommy and daddy say.

264
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:33,124
I don't talk to you
I don't talk to you

265
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:35,150
don't talk to me
don't talk to me

266
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:37,149
Don't talk to me!

267
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,294
You don't have a mommy.
- You don't have a mother either.

268
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:43,664
You don't even have a father.
- You don't even have a father.

269
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,927
Listen, you told me...

270
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,760
...As soon as we get here,
let's hand it over to someone.

271
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:54,744
Now it's been four years since we came here.

272
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:56,233
But Sujata still...

273
00:24:56,313 --> 00:24:58,218
I tried hard but we have
responsibility for him.

274
00:24:58,227 --> 00:25:02,407
Neither you nor I want to
give him away to anyone

275
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,471
That is true.

276
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:09,991
Can't we send him to hell?

277
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:14,040
From now Sujata is trying
to match Rama in everything.

278
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,680
When he grows up, we will
have to face many problems.

279
00:25:17,355 --> 00:25:19,166
OK, I'll find a good orphanage.

280
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:21,459
And what about Rama's learning?

281
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:23,130
I spoke to a good teacher.

282
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,261
He will come to teach from tomorrow.
- Daddy!

283
00:25:26,578 --> 00:25:29,550
Dad, do you eat halwa?
- Do you eat some too?

284
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,628
here

285
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:41,646
what are you eating  - Halva.
- What?

286
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,480
Don't you know what halwa is?

287
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,613
He always fights with Rama.

288
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,995
Aya told me that she used
to beat Rama sometimes.

289
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:52,511
They are still children.

290
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:55,631
Dad!  Don't I have halwa?

291
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,464
come come come here

292
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,231
Don't eat with that spoon.
- why?

293
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,120
Without thinking that he is low caste...

294
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:14,991
...do you eat what he left?

295
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,130
Sujata take this flour,
can we make puri with it?

296
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,850
Yes we can.

297
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,861
Rama!  Here is a new book
and a stone tablet for you.

298
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,050
Come and learn from your teacher

299
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,650
Where is my book, I do not study?
- No, you play.

300
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,531
Why did you buy the book Sujata?
- I am also studying.

301
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:52,623
Don't touch these books, your
father will be angry with me.

302
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,028
Brother Bahadur!
Give me a book and I will read.

303
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:06,666
a book?
I don't have any books, children.

304
00:27:06,746 --> 00:27:09,877
Liar!  Why lie?
There is a book.

305
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:13,402
But that is Ramayana.
- Okay, then I will read the Ramayana.

306
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:18,293
Sit down!
I will tell you a beautiful story.

307
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:20,925
Teacher, I will also
learn here is my book.

308
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:23,346
Are you going to study such a big book?
- Yes.

309
00:27:23,426 --> 00:27:27,250
Come on Sujata, you can't stay here.
- No, I'm studying too.

310
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,954
Listen up kids.
- not!  Let me go!  Let me go!

311
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:33,170
Come here... - Let go...
- Why what happened?

312
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,752
Look, father, he
won't let me study.

313
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:39,585
Go and go and learn.

314
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:50,085
Who did the letter come from?
- Oh!  Charu?

315
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:53,574
I have received a reply to the
letter I sent to that anathagar.

316
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:55,542
They like to accept Sujata.

317
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,947
This orphanage is very famous.

318
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:01,325
There will be no
problem for Sujata.

319
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,325
it is good.

320
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:09,617
Take two or three
days off and let him go.

321
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:16,150
No, I'm too busy
to take a vacation.

322
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:24,006
And then?  Just ask the
teacher, he will like it...

323
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:25,855
OK, I'll ask him

324
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,968
OK, I'll take care
of that, don't worry!

325
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:36,888
I will drop him off there.

326
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,613
Please meet the manager
of the orphanage...

327
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:43,022
...Tell him to take
good care of Sujata.

328
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:46,808
Money is not a problem, I'll
give whatever I want - OK.

329
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:54,688
Teacher!  I want to talk to you.
- Say yes.

330
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:57,808
Sujata has become very friendly to us.

331
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,248
Please, make him go anyway.

332
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:05,217
He doesn't want to know, we are
doing this to keep him away from us.

333
00:29:05,866 --> 00:29:07,066
Very good

334
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,888
Is it true, teacher?
- Of course children

335
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,521
That beautiful
place is far away...

336
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:19,008
...where heaven and earth meet.

337
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:21,942
You will love to see it.

338
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:25,099
There are silver trees
with golden leaves...

339
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:28,472
...They are on top and
the Kottori are always short.

340
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:21,556
Would you like to go to that country?
- Yes, I would like to.

341
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:25,967
I am taking Rama with me.
- No children, go alone for now.

342
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,168
Then you can come back...

343
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:30,420
...surprise everyone
with the beauty there.

344
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:33,816
We can take Rama later.  - Okay.

345
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:40,594
Listen!  Listen!  Children,
be ready at five this evening.

346
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:42,787
I will bring a car.  - Okay.

347
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,322
Charu!  The teacher said that
Sujata is ready to go to the orphanage.

348
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:58,701
He will pick her up
at five o'clock today.

349
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:00,225
Have everything ready.

350
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:03,589
Listen!  Today at the office I...

351
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:05,890
...I have a special
job, it will be late.

352
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:23,517
Dad!

353
00:31:26,322 --> 00:31:27,727
Here's your hat.

354
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,754
You carry this all the time;
Why did you forget today?

355
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:34,214
If I didn't remind you, you
will have to work in the sun.

356
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:35,608
Yes Sujata.

357
00:32:29,618 --> 00:32:32,788
sujata are you ready

358
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,948
Yes, Master.  - Come on

359
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:54,201
Teacher, father is not coming?
- not

360
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,698
And mother?  - No...
- Then I won't go.

361
00:32:56,778 --> 00:33:03,508
Listen children, your parents, Rama
and all three have already left for there.

362
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,627
They sent me to get you.
- really?

363
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,465
Yes.
- Then I will come with you.

364
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:19,725
Mother, mother!

365
00:33:20,817 --> 00:33:25,487
There are sweets and dolls in that world.
- I don't want them.

366
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,368
Listen Sujata...
- Mother!

367
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,613
Mom!  Mom!

368
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:34,926
Mom!  Mom!

369
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,959
Mom, the teacher is very bad.

370
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,585
He tried to trick me and
take me somewhere else.

371
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,433
I will not learn from him from today.

372
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,498
are you crying mom?  do not Cry.

373
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:51,130
I will never leave you anywhere!

374
00:33:58,923 --> 00:34:01,420
Maybe Sujata would know.  - Yes.

375
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:04,501
I wanted to see him when he was gone.

376
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:09,213
I made a mistake.
- Why do you call it a mistake?

377
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:12,822
There is nothing wrong with
that, you are like his mother.

378
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,191
Maybe this is God's will.

379
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,821
We have been several times before...

380
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:20,802
...Sujatha tried to keep away
from our lives but it didn't work.

381
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,748
If he thinks this is his
home, let him stay like this.

382
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:27,224
When he grows up...

383
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:30,685
...God's blessings will
pave a different way for us.

384
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,861
Listen!  You get angry
when you hear this.

385
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:38,131
I was ordered to another shift.

386
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,153
What forest are we going to this time?

387
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:44,272
Prepare things for the
long journey to Dehradun.

388
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:21,139
No one can be seen.

389
00:36:21,863 --> 00:36:24,025
We have not come to see
our aunt for many years.

390
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,371
We came today without even informing him.

391
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,783
I don't know if he will understand us.

392
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:30,426
Why doesn't he understand us?

393
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:42,080
Listen!

394
00:36:45,766 --> 00:36:47,874
who are you  - Didn't catch me?

395
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:51,258
You came to our house once.
- just wait.

396
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,923
I can't hear very well
until I put on my glasses.

397
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,237
Remember once you came to Madhupur?

398
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:03,085
Yes, yes Jabalpur eh?
- No, Madhupur, Madhupur!

399
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:08,480
Oh!  Madhupur!
- Hey!  born  Charu?

400
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:12,177
God bless you!

401
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:15,406
You have remembered
your aunt for a long time.

402
00:37:16,154 --> 00:37:17,720
Come on, let's go upstairs.

403
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,930
You are still that low caste girl...

404
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,374
...wasn't sent from home, was it?

405
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,952
Did you bring him this far?

406
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,216
I couldn't get rid of that orphan
girl, she got very close to us.

407
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:29,989
Don't say such things!
Your family is very important.

408
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,930
You belong to an important generation.
- What shall we do, aunt?

409
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:35,930
I thought it was our helplessness.
- Sha!

410
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,290
It is not a matter of forgiveness.

411
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,200
You lived in forests and mountains...

412
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,730
...There was no one to
gossip about them at that time.

413
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,038
But now you are
back in your society.

414
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,816
You have to follow the rules in this.

415
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,508
If you keep that low
caste girl at home...

416
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:55,686
...It also affects Rama's marriage.

417
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:57,978
That problem came to me too, aunty.

418
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:01,135
But what can we do?  We are helpless.
- No...

419
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:05,427
Where is Adir?  Can't see
the man, isn't he at home?

420
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,465
What to say about him?
He went to a city library.

421
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:13,254
He has his own
library in this house...

422
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:15,221
...but that's not enough for them.

423
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:19,373
MA  Even after passing the exam,
this boy's learning has not stopped

424
00:38:20,086 --> 00:38:22,150
Learning never ends, aunty.

425
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:26,163
So we will go now.
- Be careful.  - God bless you.

426
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:49,879
Son!  Where is Sujata?
- What time is it now?

427
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,993
I don't know how to watch the time.
- It's 4:30.

428
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:56,032
At this time, he is
collecting clothes upstairs.

429
00:39:00,346 --> 00:39:04,237
Sujata!  - Why Bahadur brother?

430
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,047
Isn't it tea time?

431
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:11,916
Tell the cook to put the
kettle on;  I will come soon.

432
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:14,727
The sugar is gone.
Shall I go get it?

433
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:17,332
No brother, I sent Basant to the shop.

434
00:39:17,526 --> 00:39:18,499
He will come soon.

435
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,231
Nothing can escape
my girl's eyes.

436
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:40,814
To tell you the truth, my head is very
confused because of my aunt's story.

437
00:42:41,344 --> 00:42:42,662
Rama's wedding...

438
00:42:42,846 --> 00:42:45,777
What will we do if we have to
face problems because of Sujata?

439
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:48,555
Nothing to worry about?

440
00:42:48,912 --> 00:42:50,858
You won't have any problems.

441
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:52,913
If our relatives ask about
our relationship with Sujata...

442
00:42:52,993 --> 00:42:55,270
...What is our answer?

443
00:42:55,659 --> 00:42:58,081
Some people already asked.

444
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,437
Listen, Sujata!

445
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:03,248
Call me sister and I will ask.

446
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:07,052
Ok ok sister!  - Why what?

447
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,171
These look great.
- Is that what called me?

448
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:13,106
No, to something else

449
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:17,021
Why did you do that?

450
00:43:17,101 --> 00:43:19,225
Don't you remember you hit me yesterday?

451
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:21,312
Is that too?  wait

452
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:25,016
I will give tea to father and mother
and teach them a good lesson.

453
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:29,416
We can marry him but who...

454
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,755
...marrying a low caste
girl without education?

455
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:33,416
If he is uneducated like that...

456
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:35,016
...we have to be responsible for it.

457
00:43:36,901 --> 00:43:38,416
Is it tea time yet?

458
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:41,172
Sujata, you are the watch of this house.

459
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,994
Dad, Mom made a great cake today.

460
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:46,031
Not me, you made it.

461
00:43:46,111 --> 00:43:48,736
If you didn't tell me how to
do it, I wouldn't be able to do it.

462
00:43:48,946 --> 00:43:50,616
Never mind, I'll fix it.

463
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:59,136
Charu, there are women's
welfare ashrams, right?

464
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,701
If we take their help, won't Sujata
be able to find someone suitable?

465
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,416
It doesn't matter what his caste is...

466
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,087
...If he has studied,
if he has a job...

467
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,776
...or if you have a small business.

468
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,016
Anyone can find God if they try.

469
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:15,985
What if we pay a large dowry?

470
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:17,416
If that happens, there
will be no problem.

471
00:44:17,746 --> 00:44:20,904
Anyone would love to
marry a girl like Sujata.

472
00:44:23,823 --> 00:44:27,499
Who is home?
Is this the eighth house?

473
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:34,591
This is the eighth house.
- I want to meet you.  - I am born.

474
00:44:34,937 --> 00:44:37,477
Oh, are you...
- I can't understand you.

475
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,229
you don't know me

476
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:40,829
Is Charu at home?

477
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:44,245
I am his uncle.  - Ah, come in.

478
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,261
Uncle, you?

479
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:50,007
Come on, come on.
- Charu, are you okay?

480
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,044
sit down

481
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:54,569
Sha!  You have
prepared tea for me.

482
00:44:56,797 --> 00:45:00,029
Charu where are your children?

483
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:02,354
Uncle, God gave me only one child

484
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,975
Talk to him.

485
00:45:04,224 --> 00:45:05,835
I want to see him.

486
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:08,905
Rama!  - I came in a hurry.

487
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:12,462
I came here but how can
I leave without seeing you?

488
00:45:12,542 --> 00:45:13,911
did you drink tea

489
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:16,106
is this your daughter

490
00:45:16,186 --> 00:45:19,793
Sha!  He looks like Goddess Lakshmi.
- Mom, why did you call?

491
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:21,490
This is my daughter Rama.

492
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,214
This is Sujata...
She is like a daughter to us.

493
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:51,083
Listen, listen to what I say.

494
00:45:51,768 --> 00:45:54,623
You can't sleep here
go to your room - why?

495
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:56,407
Honey, don't be stubborn.

496
00:45:56,612 --> 00:45:58,795
Let's go.
- No, today I sleep here.

497
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,579
I said no.

498
00:46:00,795 --> 00:46:03,239
come with me  - Open my pillow.

499
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,331
Why only Rama always
sleeps with his mother?

500
00:46:06,411 --> 00:46:08,255
You don't fit Rama's situation.

501
00:46:08,525 --> 00:46:10,741
why is that  - Mother
Rama's daughter.

502
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:13,076
And me?
Am I not my mother's daughter?

503
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:15,142
No, you are not his daughter.

504
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:16,666
You are a big liar.

505
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:19,174
If you want to be my
mother's daughter, ask her.

506
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:22,428
Mom!

507
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,337
Is Rama only your daughter?

508
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,483
Tell me, mother!
Am I not your daughter?

509
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:33,013
not.  - Then?

510
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:36,538
You are like a daughter to me.

511
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,570
Son of Adir.

512
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:32,430
You study sitting so high...

513
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:33,716
...what if you fall?

514
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:36,603
Grandma, grab these books.

515
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,771
These are very heavy.

516
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:46,517
Not heavy?  There is no
such and such knowledge

517
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,734
Wait, let me read it to you.
- No, you don't need to.

518
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:50,388
I can't understand them.

519
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,766
I came to tell you something.

520
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:54,301
About marriage?

521
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:58,918
I said, I am not
getting married.

522
00:47:58,998 --> 00:48:00,226
Not getting married?  - No.

523
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,616
So I am the money in the bank...

524
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:04,767
...some of the company shares...

525
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:07,141
...is given to the hospital.

526
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:09,553
I won't let you give them.

527
00:48:09,718 --> 00:48:13,627
I will not marry, but
keep your property

528
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:15,512
I won't give you anything.

529
00:48:15,702 --> 00:48:17,864
I will give it to my daughter-in-law

530
00:48:17,944 --> 00:48:19,222
Oh my god.

531
00:48:19,507 --> 00:48:21,747
Then I will not marry.

532
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,446
you love me so much

533
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:27,366
...Why find someone
who will divide your love?

534
00:48:27,387 --> 00:48:28,598
stupid boy

535
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:31,248
Our story is not over.

536
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:35,712
I am going to Upendra's house today.

537
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:37,961
You should come with me.
- Can't.

538
00:48:38,245 --> 00:48:40,811
I have a lot of work.
- You are always working.

539
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:43,074
You need to hang out with people.

540
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:45,571
They came here twice.

541
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,868
You should meet them at least once.

542
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:50,365
I will definitely take you along

543
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:54,551
Grandma, why are you
trying so hard to take me on?

544
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,197
There are no
marriageable girls there.

545
00:48:58,418 --> 00:49:00,874
Even so, why are you afraid?

546
00:49:01,193 --> 00:49:04,631
You have made a promise
that you will not get married.

547
00:49:05,101 --> 00:49:08,872
OK, I'll come too.  Please... Send
me some biscuits in Ramu's hands.

548
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:11,501
I am in Hama.
- I'll send him right away.

549
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:27,787
Where is Rama?

550
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:30,555
He is in the garden.
Will come soon.

551
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:35,555
It is very good for us
to be close to Gandhi.

552
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:37,653
You can go for a walk in the evening.

553
00:49:38,034 --> 00:49:39,943
...You can be happy here.

554
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:43,576
Yes, I like it here too, Dad.

555
00:49:44,296 --> 00:49:46,918
Sister!

556
00:49:47,396 --> 00:49:48,911
Listen to this.  - Can't.

557
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,590
I don't want to fight with you.

558
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,983
Are you going to
sit here like a statue?

559
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,906
Dad, tough him out.

560
00:50:00,243 --> 00:50:02,208
You don't tell him anything.

561
00:50:04,423 --> 00:50:05,807
why are you laughing

562
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:07,407
He wasn't the one laughing.
I laughed too.

563
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,609
No dad, I saw.

564
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:10,998
He covered his face and smiled.

565
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:12,509
Okay, don't fight.

566
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,064
Let's go home then.

567
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:16,262
Sister, let's have a match with me.

568
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:18,200
Let's see who goes home first.

569
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,487
You can't compete with me.

570
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:23,446
do not!  Wait!

571
00:50:57,022 --> 00:51:00,664
who are you  - I am Adir.

572
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:03,973
How are you?

573
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:06,430
My name is Adir

574
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,146
My grandmother lives in Shyam Street...

575
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:11,173
So you are the aunt who
lives in Shyam Bazaar...

576
00:51:11,253 --> 00:51:14,051
...famous grandson.

577
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:16,608
Yes.  - Sit down.

578
00:51:19,005 --> 00:51:20,998
Do you both live in the same house...
- No.

579
00:51:21,491 --> 00:51:22,858
We are neighbors

580
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:25,925
Oh, why are you standing?

581
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:28,997
Sit down, imagine your home.

582
00:51:29,201 --> 00:51:31,011
what  - Yes.

583
00:51:31,343 --> 00:51:32,522
You go, I'll come.

584
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:39,235
Son, did you meet Rama?

585
00:51:39,511 --> 00:51:43,380
Yes, but I still couldn't figure
out which of these two is Rama.

586
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,549
This is my daughter Rama.

587
00:51:45,954 --> 00:51:48,998
He is now a B.A.  studying for  He
has won many trophies in debates.

588
00:51:49,435 --> 00:51:50,947
Mom...
- And Araya?

589
00:51:52,806 --> 00:51:55,009
She is Sujata, my daughter.

590
00:51:55,855 --> 00:51:57,654
Rama is also good at learning.

591
00:51:58,378 --> 00:51:59,839
He is good at homework.

592
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,053
mother

593
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,251
He also has many sports achievements.

594
00:52:04,389 --> 00:52:06,327
He has filled this cupboard.

595
00:52:07,152 --> 00:52:09,399
Boy, everyone
praises his singing.

596
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:12,028
His birthday is near now.

597
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:13,589
Come to it too.

598
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,942
Yes, he will definitely come to it.

599
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:18,904
Why only for birthdays, now
you both know each other.

600
00:52:18,992 --> 00:52:20,974
Come whenever you have time off.

601
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:22,794
Son, now you are like our relative.

602
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:26,015
You guys keep talking.

603
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:28,313
I will go and send tea.

604
00:52:32,337 --> 00:52:34,773
why this  Why are
you bringing tea?

605
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:37,044
I told Madhav to bring tea.

606
00:52:37,065 --> 00:52:39,228
What happens that I brought?

607
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:42,063
Aunty doesn't drink and
Adir doesn't drink either.

608
00:52:42,306 --> 00:52:44,830
Go and tell Madhav
to make tea again.

609
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:49,014
back?
why is that  - Don't argue with me, go.

610
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:06,408
Upen, come on, we've
been waiting for you.

611
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:08,544
sit down

612
00:53:09,447 --> 00:53:12,481
This is my Adir son, worship.

613
00:53:12,868 --> 00:53:15,332
Don't want to, son, be happy.
sit down

614
00:53:16,046 --> 00:53:18,000
I was very young when I saw it.

615
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:20,773
Now he is taller than me.

616
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:26,212
So tell me, what are
you doing right now?

617
00:53:26,254 --> 00:53:27,627
I'm doing some testing.

618
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,229
Advanced degree?  - Yes.

619
00:53:30,496 --> 00:53:31,696
What is the subject of investigation?

620
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:36,040
Upen, why are you
talking about learning?

621
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:38,355
Better than that... Son of Rama...

622
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:40,237
You sing a song.

623
00:53:40,498 --> 00:53:42,539
Aunt, why do you want to sing?
- Why say why?

624
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,125
Everyone likes your songs.

625
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:46,537
So let me ask.

626
00:53:46,994 --> 00:53:48,570
Yes, say it, son.

627
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,894
Sing the song that got you
a gold medal in that school.

628
00:53:50,974 --> 00:53:53,112
My throat doesn't feel right today.

629
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,327
There is no such color.

630
00:53:55,407 --> 00:53:57,895
This tea is better than my song.

631
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,445
Have tea first, then we'll see.

632
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:04,903
Son, have you seen
how intelligent Rama is?

633
00:54:07,897 --> 00:54:11,073
Son Adir, come visit us often.

634
00:54:11,153 --> 00:54:14,262
Yes, he will come.  ok

635
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:38,416
Why did you sit here?
It's going to rain, come inside.

636
00:54:39,562 --> 00:54:40,683
Look, Charu.

637
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:47,892
I don't want to keep Sujata
away and hurt her heart.

638
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,940
I don't like it either.

639
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:53,378
But you know how Aunty
feels about the lower castes.

640
00:54:53,777 --> 00:54:55,161
If Sujata had brought the tea...

641
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,560
...Aunty does not drink and
Adir is not allowed to drink.

642
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:02,069
Mom!

643
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:07,427
who am i  - Why are you
asking these questions all at once?

644
00:55:07,953 --> 00:55:11,629
I want to know who I am.
- why?  Why is that?

645
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:15,630
They drank tea made by Mahadev.

646
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,253
But why not drink the tea I made?

647
00:55:19,222 --> 00:55:21,110
Why do I poison the tea I make?

648
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:24,613
don't bother me  I
don't have time for that.

649
00:55:25,316 --> 00:55:28,532
Mom, you have to say today.
- Don't bother me Sujata.

650
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,100
I won't let you go without telling you.
tell me.

651
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,685
Where did the strength come from?
Listen to something you like.

652
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:38,512
who am i  - You... You are low caste.
- Low caste?

653
00:55:38,783 --> 00:55:40,792
Yes, the lowest of the low.

654
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,819
People even move
away from your shadow...

655
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:44,679
...don't eat anything you catch.

656
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:51,173
But... how can I be low caste?
- You were born in a low caste.

657
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,724
Your parents are low caste.

658
00:55:54,515 --> 00:55:56,214
Where are my low caste parents?

659
00:55:57,853 --> 00:56:00,571
They are dead.

660
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,054
If they were alive, you wouldn't
be a burden to us either...

661
00:56:09,294 --> 00:56:10,551
a burden

662
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,190
Am I just a burden?

663
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:38,426
"How do we want to die?
By suicide? Not at all."

664
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:42,405
"Die for life if you must"

665
00:58:44,491 --> 00:58:46,361
who  - Mr. came to get the
money for the newspaper.

666
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:48,333
Hang in there brother.
I will bring the money

667
00:58:54,361 --> 00:58:55,537
Sujata!

668
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:04,211
Don't get me wrong about
your mom, she really...

669
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:07,230
Dad, why are you telling me this?

670
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:11,002
I don't understand
his situation, right?

671
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:18,309
Sujata bring my shawl, I want to go out.
- Okay.

672
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:32,563
It's very sunny outside, take an umbrella.

673
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:46,591
I saw you!

674
00:59:48,157 --> 00:59:49,311
come inside

675
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,203
Did this book guy come alone today?

676
00:59:54,283 --> 00:59:56,031
No, grandma came with me too...

677
00:59:56,111 --> 00:59:58,622
...but he's talking to your mom.

678
00:59:58,881 --> 00:59:59,910
sit down

679
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,151
Wait!

680
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,428
Listen lady!  If you bother
me like this, I'm leaving.

681
01:00:05,508 --> 01:00:10,557
Listen!  You are the one who bothers me.
- How is that?

682
01:00:10,903 --> 01:00:14,422
I don't like anyone
to call me lady.

683
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:15,996
really?  - Yes.

684
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:23,010
Here, look at this
magazine while I make tea.

685
01:00:24,782 --> 01:00:28,597
"Chandramalika".
Written by Rama Devi.

686
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:32,540
Don't read it, it's so stupid.

687
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,391
Let me read it first and
then I'll tell you what I think.

688
01:00:35,887 --> 01:00:38,378
My heart!  Oh my dear heart!

689
01:00:38,784 --> 01:00:40,955
You are like a spring flower.

690
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:44,336
How do you get rid of wasps?

691
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,513
All these colors...
- Don't read it, I'm ashamed.

692
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:50,883
What is there to be ashamed of?
It's really good.

693
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:56,668
Rama, who was the other
person with you that day?

694
01:00:56,936 --> 01:01:00,725
my sister  - elder sister?
But your mother said...

695
01:01:00,881 --> 01:01:03,657
Don't mind what mom says.
He reads nonsense anyway.

696
01:01:04,124 --> 01:01:06,666
Don't you write poetry, Mr. Adir?

697
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:09,564
I don't write
poetry, I just read.

698
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:16,250
Rama!  I can't see your sister.
Has he gone out?

699
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:20,228
No, he is at home, but it is
not easy to take care of him.

700
01:01:20,565 --> 01:01:22,537
He does not sit
still for a minute.

701
01:01:22,805 --> 01:01:26,645
He works like clockwork throughout the day.
- Like a clock?

702
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,534
Don't you understand?, ask.

703
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:32,872
At eight in the morning,
he works in the kitchen

704
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:34,463
When he sat down at ten in the morning...

705
01:01:34,543 --> 01:01:36,426
...making a list of items
to bring from the store.

706
01:01:36,764 --> 01:01:38,467
At ten thirty in the morning he runs here and there...

707
01:01:38,547 --> 01:01:40,674
...Find Mahadev, give him
money and open his shop.

708
01:01:40,715 --> 01:01:42,428
At three in the afternoon...

709
01:01:42,508 --> 01:01:44,997
...She is picking up the things she brought from the shop.

710
01:01:45,678 --> 01:01:50,421
Anyone can see him
upstairs at four thirty...

711
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:52,817
Take home the clothes left to dry.

712
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,205
At five in the afternoon he makes tea again.

713
01:01:55,654 --> 01:01:58,924
And this time?
- At this time?  What time is it now?

714
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:03,006
Now it's half past six, come, I'll take you to see him.
- to where?

715
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:04,709
come on

716
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:15,158
The only thing is that I did not
bow to Adir to come here that day.

717
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:18,765
But today, as soon as he
came back from college...

718
01:02:18,964 --> 01:02:21,722
...Grandma asked if we
should go to Mr. Upen's house

719
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:27,914
Look how happy they are.

720
01:02:28,304 --> 01:02:29,947
That's a good sign.

721
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:41,933
Let me go, bad girl let go.

722
01:02:42,097 --> 01:02:44,278
So should I open my eyes?
- Yes, open it.

723
01:02:44,813 --> 01:02:46,750
1, 2, 3.

724
01:02:51,178 --> 01:02:54,518
Mr. Adir, all the roses here...

725
01:02:54,598 --> 01:02:56,703
...the result of my sister's hard work.

726
01:02:56,783 --> 01:02:58,718
His hands have magic power.

727
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:01,927
I can only write about a garden in poetry.

728
01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:05,023
But he himself is really building those estates.

729
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:08,440
Sujata, don't you write poetry?

730
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:12,816
No, sister...
- Rama, I didn't ask you.

731
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:16,751
Sujata, you are a B.A.  What
are the subjects to study?

732
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:19,337
Are you talking about
learning with this?

733
01:03:21,273 --> 01:03:25,840
This is a very illiterate, B.A.
How do you know what it means?

734
01:03:26,018 --> 01:03:28,973
So there is no problem that
my sister did not go to a college

735
01:03:29,353 --> 01:03:31,098
He can read and write.

736
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:33,571
Being able to read and write letters
A B C does not make one a scholar.

737
01:03:33,787 --> 01:03:35,439
My co-worker can do them too.

738
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:36,696
Grandma, you said we
need to go home soon...

739
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:38,909
...He said you have
important work to do.

740
01:03:39,194 --> 01:03:41,279
Come on, we're late now.  - Yes.

741
01:03:41,642 --> 01:03:44,336
You go to the car
and I will meet Charu.

742
01:04:07,293 --> 01:04:10,398
Mr. Adir, what happened?
-Nirmal?

743
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:14,991
Who were you thinking about?
- About myself.

744
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:21,737
I still can't find you.

745
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:25,084
How can I send you this letter?

746
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:28,834
No, I was thinking about my own problems.

747
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:32,753
Oh, I believe you, so
after all these years...

748
01:04:33,092 --> 01:04:37,431
...you've got a problem of your own.

749
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:39,991
Good, very good.

750
01:04:53,421 --> 01:04:57,676
Mr. Adir!
I didn't think you would come today.

751
01:04:57,821 --> 01:05:00,661
why?  Did I do something wrong?
- Yes, it's a mistake.

752
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:05,826
It's great if you make mistakes like that every day.

753
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:10,434
Why are you standing here?
Let's go inside.

754
01:05:10,676 --> 01:05:11,763
let's go

755
01:05:12,415 --> 01:05:15,861
Mr. Adir established a
badminton team in our college.

756
01:05:15,941 --> 01:05:17,661
Now we are divided
into two groups.

757
01:05:17,922 --> 01:05:20,421
Some people say that only
girls should be in that group...

758
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:22,378
...Men are not good to be its members.

759
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,941
But I don't agree with that.

760
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:29,541
We must also give a chance to the
needy boys.  What do you say about that?

761
01:05:33,787 --> 01:05:35,021
Why are you looking around?

762
01:05:35,385 --> 01:05:39,421
Rama, it's six o'clock.  Your sister
should be in the garden now, right?

763
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,336
Who is Sujata?
- Yes - Yes, he wants to stay in the garden.

764
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,439
Then you meet him, I'll go.

765
01:05:45,723 --> 01:05:49,792
Where are you going?
- I said I have a match.

766
01:06:03,153 --> 01:06:04,903
Rama might be studying in the room.

767
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:09,601
No, I just met him.
He went out to play.

768
01:06:15,965 --> 01:06:17,065
Sujata!

769
01:06:21,465 --> 01:06:23,264
You look so beautiful in this garden.

770
01:06:26,454 --> 01:06:31,504
Do you know what your greatest quality is?
- attribute?  - Yes.

771
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:36,424
Your greatest quality is
that you have no such quality.

772
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:42,997
how is aunt  - Is that the
answer I get for what I said?

773
01:06:45,316 --> 01:06:47,640
So tell me what I want to say.

774
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:50,643
You can tell my qualities.

775
01:06:52,691 --> 01:06:54,753
You have many qualities.

776
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,646
I don't have the strength to say it all.

777
01:06:57,846 --> 01:07:01,526
Then tell me my mistakes.
- Wrong?

778
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:08,729
Yes, my biggest mistake.
- I don't know, I don't understand.

779
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,530
Really?  don't you understand

780
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:18,118
My biggest mistake was
coming here just to see you.

781
01:07:26,787 --> 01:07:29,727
Mom's in, wanna meet her?

782
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:34,142
Let's go and meet him.

783
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:50,477
Mom!  Mr. Adir has come.
- Adir?  Come on son

784
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:53,300
Rama!  - He went out to play.

785
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,776
He may not know that you have come.

786
01:07:55,856 --> 01:07:57,775
No, he met me and left.

787
01:07:58,404 --> 01:08:00,071
left you and went to play?

788
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:01,925
Is playing that important?

789
01:08:03,185 --> 01:08:04,845
Please don't think about them, son.

790
01:08:07,294 --> 01:08:09,702
what are you
doing here  go inside

791
01:08:13,144 --> 01:08:17,078
Sit down, I'll make some tea".
- Please don't worry.

792
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:20,156
I just came here to see you.

793
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:23,775
No, son, you just came.
- I'll come another day.

794
01:08:24,576 --> 01:08:25,905
Oh, come on, son.

795
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:36,596
Rama!  - Why what?

796
01:10:38,084 --> 01:10:39,447
Why did it take so long to come today?

797
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:43,108
Had drama training in college...
- That's okay.

798
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:46,658
I ask, when will you grow up?
- why?  what happened

799
01:10:46,738 --> 01:10:49,653
Adir came this evening,
but did you leave him?

800
01:10:49,888 --> 01:10:53,915
At that time I had a match.
- Is that game worth it to you?

801
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:58,012
I don't know what Adir was
thinking about knowing some customs.

802
01:10:58,185 --> 01:11:02,212
Listen mom, I know what Mr. Adir
wants and what he doesn't want.

803
01:11:35,219 --> 01:11:36,904
Your exam is coming up...

804
01:11:36,984 --> 01:11:39,270
...but you sleep soundly
with the book in your hand.

805
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,810
I do what I like.
What are they for you?

806
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:43,615
why?  Aren't I your sister?

807
01:11:43,837 --> 01:11:45,476
If you fall asleep
while studying again...

808
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:47,130
...I pour cold water on my head.

809
01:11:47,338 --> 01:11:48,991
I will beat you before that.

810
01:11:59,805 --> 01:12:01,372
Is Mr. Upen at home?

811
01:12:03,022 --> 01:12:06,531
Yes he is, sit
down;  I will call him.

812
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:19,474
Hello Mr. Upen, how are you?

813
01:12:19,554 --> 01:12:22,187
Hello, I'm sorry I
didn't catch you.

814
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:24,771
You had placed an ad in a
newspaper about a girl's marriage...

815
01:12:24,851 --> 01:12:27,117
Yes, yes, sit down.

816
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:32,145
Listen, Mr. Upen, I
came here today...

817
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:34,567
...not because my boy is unmarried.

818
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:38,069
My wish is...

819
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:41,560
...get together with
a good family like you.

820
01:12:41,798 --> 01:12:45,787
I am lucky that you are here.

821
01:12:46,316 --> 01:12:50,046
So, what are you
waiting for?  I ask...

822
01:12:50,126 --> 01:12:54,316
No, no, nothing like that, I
think very freely in this matter.

823
01:12:54,651 --> 01:12:57,635
I do not expect
anything as dowry.

824
01:12:58,294 --> 01:13:01,268
Mr. Upen asking for
a dowry is very low.

825
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:06,630
But if you give me something
willingly, I will accept it.

826
01:13:06,878 --> 01:13:08,554
You have very valuable ideas.

827
01:13:09,376 --> 01:13:14,381
Such bad things are
ruining our society, sir.

828
01:13:14,954 --> 01:13:17,170
I don't think money
is very important.

829
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:19,592
The real value is
that man's character...

830
01:13:19,765 --> 01:13:21,710
...His culture, his ability.

831
01:13:22,586 --> 01:13:25,765
Money is not a big thing.
What matters is the person.

832
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:29,516
If man is not important,
what can I do with money?

833
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,246
eat them

834
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:35,765
Oh my God!  When
will our society improve?

835
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:37,354
Only for people with advanced ideas...

836
01:13:37,434 --> 01:13:38,846
...a society can be developed.

837
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,998
So, what does your son do?

838
01:13:43,312 --> 01:13:46,436
My son B.A.  Passed, Mr. Upen.
- is it.

839
01:13:47,614 --> 01:13:50,089
He is good looking.

840
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:54,868
But a very free man.
I don't want to do a job.

841
01:13:54,906 --> 01:13:56,917
He wants to start
his own business.

842
01:13:56,955 --> 01:14:01,583
You know you need
money to start a business.

843
01:14:02,091 --> 01:14:05,334
There is a big competition...
- Don't worry about it.

844
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:07,939
I will take care of
everything for his business.

845
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:10,987
That's what I expected from you.

846
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:13,615
Now your daughter is mine...

847
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:16,188
Sorry, but she is
not my own daughter.

848
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:21,583
She is like a daughter to me.
- There is no difference.

849
01:14:21,853 --> 01:14:24,642
He might be your relative's child.
- No.

850
01:14:24,837 --> 01:14:27,809
then?
- I think I should make everything clear...

851
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:29,854
...for someone with good ideas like you.

852
01:14:30,889 --> 01:14:33,130
Actually that girl is of low caste.

853
01:14:33,768 --> 01:14:35,822
I didn't expect this from you.
- But someone like you who thinks new way...

854
01:14:35,902 --> 01:14:39,605
Forget it!  I should
have thought again...

855
01:14:39,689 --> 01:14:41,554
...If this girl was a
drunkard or a blind person.

856
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:46,536
Be careful!  Next time, don't make fools of
people by placing advertisements in the newspaper.

857
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:48,071
got it  bye Bye.

858
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,563
Did you hear what that man said?

859
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:20,071
Come on auntie.  Come on Adir.

860
01:15:20,151 --> 01:15:22,903
Where is Rama Charu?
- Come on aunty.

861
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:31,418
oh god  - Here is Rama.

862
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:33,541
Rama, talk to aunt.

863
01:15:33,621 --> 01:15:37,055
God bless you!  Good luck!

864
01:15:37,423 --> 01:15:39,747
Put this here.

865
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:43,413
Adir says this will suit you.

866
01:15:47,239 --> 01:15:51,348
Very nice!
Look at her, isn't she beautiful?

867
01:15:51,428 --> 01:15:53,002
Here, sister, keep this.

868
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:55,186
That's really nice of you Rama.

869
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:56,429
shut up

870
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,852
Come, Mrs. Gupta.

871
01:16:07,365 --> 01:16:11,478
Sha!  Your daughter is so beautiful!
like a moon

872
01:16:11,558 --> 01:16:14,462
No, Mrs. Gupta, you are wrong.

873
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:16,678
Our daughter Rama is holding her hand.
- And this one?

874
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:19,381
This is Sujata.  But she
is also like our daughter.

875
01:16:25,759 --> 01:16:27,576
Bring on the sweetness.

876
01:16:28,808 --> 01:16:30,938
here  - Thank you sir.

877
01:16:32,494 --> 01:16:35,500
Listen till Charu Sujata
stays in this house...

878
01:16:35,694 --> 01:16:37,943
...We cannot marry
Rama and Adir.

879
01:16:38,516 --> 01:16:42,765
You know how hard we
work to tie him up, aunty.

880
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:45,110
You always say the same thing.

881
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:48,300
Sujata is also trying to find a
boy from an important family.

882
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:51,889
Forget them.  It doesn't matter
what a low caste girl wants.

883
01:16:52,786 --> 01:16:54,744
It is beyond your limits.

884
01:16:55,003 --> 01:16:58,884
I will call our driver
and find someone better.

885
01:17:02,537 --> 01:17:03,833
why aunty

886
01:17:03,913 --> 01:17:09,303
Your college friends say
they want to hear your song.

887
01:17:09,383 --> 01:17:12,806
Today is my birthday,
so why am I singing?

888
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,103
Meena sings.
-Okay, I'll sing the song;  But you play the piano.

889
01:17:16,183 --> 01:17:17,346
agree

890
01:20:28,886 --> 01:20:31,449
Look what I brought you Rama!

891
01:20:35,488 --> 01:20:38,574
Why are you taking Rama in
your lap and feeding him today?

892
01:20:38,651 --> 01:20:40,535
Why is he dressed
so nicely today?

893
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:43,011
Today is my
birthday, that's what

894
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:50,206
Come on!  - Yes ma'am?
- Wipe his mouth.

895
01:20:55,482 --> 01:20:57,393
Have a birthday too mom.

896
01:20:58,932 --> 01:21:01,017
Have a birthday too mom.

897
01:21:01,097 --> 01:21:03,828
I want to dress
like Rama too, mom!

898
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:05,921
Have a birthday too mom.

899
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:11,370
I too will sit on your lap
and eat kheer, mother!  Mom!

900
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,974
Take him away again, he is bothering me.
- do not...

901
01:21:14,054 --> 01:21:16,715
I'm not going, let me go!

902
01:21:16,923 --> 01:21:19,604
Come on.  - Let me go!

903
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,467
Bad boy!  I'll put it in
the room now and lock it.

904
01:21:22,683 --> 01:21:24,629
Mom, have a birthday for me too.

905
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:31,885
Mom, have a birthday for me too

906
01:21:33,225 --> 01:21:34,869
Mom!

907
01:21:35,309 --> 01:21:37,575
Have a birthday too mom.

908
01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:40,775
Mom!  - Sujata!

909
01:21:42,954 --> 01:21:46,888
Why did you come from the party?
- Why did you come from the party?

910
01:21:47,865 --> 01:21:51,160
I don't understand.
- But I understood everything.

911
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:56,487
There is no one who can
understand everything in this world.

912
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:58,389
But I can.

913
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:05,092
That's a very small problem.
Why is Sujata thinking so much about it?

914
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:11,984
what's the problem  - Your
mother doesn't call you daughter.

915
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:31,625
Why are you crying Sujata?

916
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,635
You are Mr. Upen's daughter.

917
01:22:35,388 --> 01:22:39,064
Who says no?

918
01:22:42,256 --> 01:22:44,729
do you believe it
- Without a doubt.

919
01:22:50,896 --> 01:22:52,763
say it again

920
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:55,695
I can say that a thousand times.

921
01:22:56,448 --> 01:22:59,977
The truth is that you are Mr. Upen's daughter.

922
01:23:10,968 --> 01:23:13,562
Sujata, when is your birthday?

923
01:23:15,872 --> 01:23:17,818
It has been erased from memory.

924
01:23:18,268 --> 01:23:19,617
I didn't understand.

925
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:24,555
If you understand so
much, why not this?

926
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:27,738
No one knows
when my birthday is.

927
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:35,539
I think they know.  - Who?
- Stars glittering in the sky.

928
01:23:36,862 --> 01:23:39,785
The stars must have
shone like this that day.

929
01:23:41,446 --> 01:23:43,556
Sujata, if I tell you…

930
01:23:43,636 --> 01:23:45,468
...that you want to give me
a present for your birthday?

931
01:23:46,514 --> 01:23:47,760
Do you accept it?

932
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,663
Tell me Sujata.

933
01:23:54,574 --> 01:23:57,099
I got that gift.  - Got it?

934
01:23:59,184 --> 01:24:00,516
How is that?

935
01:24:03,178 --> 01:24:05,801
At least you thought so...

936
01:24:05,814 --> 01:24:08,527
...that the girl without
a birthday is also human.

937
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:10,178
You understood his pain.

938
01:24:11,238 --> 01:24:13,599
I do not expect a greater gift.

939
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:25,630
Sujata!

940
01:24:30,075 --> 01:24:31,606
But I am very scared.

941
01:24:34,495 --> 01:24:36,518
I can't take that much joy.

942
01:30:03,971 --> 01:30:05,331
Sujata!

943
01:30:08,917 --> 01:30:12,531
Madam, they have come.  - Who?

944
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:16,371
You told the driver to find
someone good for Sujata...

945
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:17,851
...so he came with someone.

946
01:30:18,993 --> 01:30:20,571
ok come on

947
01:30:26,751 --> 01:30:31,092
Didn't that guy come with you?
- I am the one.

948
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,312
what do you do for
a living  - Tell him.

949
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:37,051
He has a shop in his village

950
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:44,912
Have you been married before?
- Yes.

951
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:50,638
I... I have been alone for two
years... .  I have... two children.

952
01:30:51,313 --> 01:30:56,838
They are so bad...
that's why I... say!

953
01:30:56,918 --> 01:31:01,102
OK, I'll get everything
ready and let you know.

954
01:31:03,748 --> 01:31:08,514
He has a lot of money, but he's a little old...
- That's okay.

955
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,875
Money is more valuable.

956
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,965
Who is this, Aunt Ah?
Has Rama come to you?

957
01:31:20,048 --> 01:31:22,208
Yes, Rama was
here before this...

958
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:24,448
...Adiru also said he wanted to come there.

959
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:29,383
But remember this, Charu.
Do not bring Sujathava to the play.

960
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:32,004
I mean if he gets there...

961
01:31:32,938 --> 01:31:36,406
Ok aunty, everything
will be fine -yes.

962
01:31:36,568 --> 01:31:40,408
Shall I tell you
more good news, sir?

963
01:31:40,648 --> 01:31:42,568
I found someone suitable for Sujata.

964
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:44,568
I will tell you everything
when we meet this evening.

965
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:54,208
Listen Sujata, there is a
play in Rama's college today...

966
01:31:54,288 --> 01:31:57,808
Yes mom, I remember I
would wear that pink saree.

967
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:02,101
Listen Sujata, Aunty is also coming over...

968
01:32:04,115 --> 01:32:06,328
Okay mom, I'm not going.

969
01:32:12,671 --> 01:32:14,589
It took you a long time to come.

970
01:32:15,367 --> 01:32:18,481
where is sister  - He
had some homework.

971
01:32:18,561 --> 01:32:19,779
He can grow up anytime!

972
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:21,448
Even though I asked so much, he did not come.

973
01:32:21,451 --> 01:32:24,446
The last bell rang.
You go sit down.

974
01:32:24,536 --> 01:32:26,732
First there is a Manipuri
dance and next is my play.

975
01:32:26,812 --> 01:32:28,426
I need to put on my makeup until then.
- Come on.

976
01:32:32,994 --> 01:32:35,087
Grandma, I won't
wait until the end.

977
01:32:35,346 --> 01:32:36,946
I have some work
to do with a professor.

978
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:40,147
You are always working.

979
01:36:28,213 --> 01:36:31,973
How did you know I was here?
- My heart told me.

980
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,394
You are Chandalika
in Rama's college...

981
01:36:36,627 --> 01:36:38,533
...didn't go to the play?

982
01:36:39,196 --> 01:36:41,413
I went.  - So?

983
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:45,017
I came from there
for a reason - really?

984
01:36:45,311 --> 01:36:48,013
Are you lying too?
- Yes, I say.

985
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,656
But it doesn't bother anyone...

986
01:36:51,374 --> 01:36:54,073
...only if it's not
something that I gain from.

987
01:36:56,605 --> 01:36:58,853
I have seen the drama
Chandalika several times.

988
01:36:58,933 --> 01:37:03,974
Yes, how is it?
- Don't you know its story?  - No.

989
01:37:05,213 --> 01:37:06,893
Then why didn't you come there?

990
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:11,274
just

991
01:37:12,052 --> 01:37:15,183
It's a beautiful story.
- Please tell me.

992
01:37:16,955 --> 01:37:20,973
Bishmanand is a good
disciple of Buddha.

993
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:24,973
One day, while walking in
the sun, he felt very sick.

994
01:37:26,011 --> 01:37:27,473
As he approached a well he saw.

995
01:37:27,992 --> 01:37:29,626
...a girl draws water from it.

996
01:37:29,869 --> 01:37:32,386
Son!  Could you give
me some water, please?

997
01:37:33,104 --> 01:37:37,912
No, sir, I'm sorry.
- Why is that?

998
01:37:38,413 --> 01:37:42,746
I was born in a very low caste.

999
01:37:43,092 --> 01:37:47,002
You have misunderstood
the child, just like us.

1000
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,825
This comforts everyone...

1001
01:37:50,905 --> 01:37:54,469
...everyone's thirty nivana
water belongs to everyone.

1002
01:37:55,175 --> 01:38:00,520
But sir, I belong to the Shudra caste.
- That's a lie.

1003
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:05,035
Oh beautiful children,
the monsoons bring...

1004
01:38:05,115 --> 01:38:08,086
...Black clouds are also
called Chandal Megha.

1005
01:38:08,122 --> 01:38:11,668
But does the water coming
from those clouds get dirty?

1006
01:38:11,832 --> 01:38:13,926
When Janaki stopped in the forest...

1007
01:38:14,618 --> 01:38:16,434
...Chandal also brings
water for him to bathe.

1008
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:22,193
If I give you water,
it will be a sin for you.

1009
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:25,709
How can I commit
that heinous sin?

1010
01:38:25,789 --> 01:38:30,357
No, children, that would
do me a lot of good.

1011
01:38:31,395 --> 01:38:33,469
Don't let yourself down.

1012
01:38:33,504 --> 01:38:36,321
Buddha said if someone
insults himself...

1013
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,029
...that it is a greater
sin than suicide.

1014
01:38:40,519 --> 01:38:45,890
I am very tired children
please give me some water.

1015
01:38:53,019 --> 01:38:57,387
That Chandal girl quenched
Bishmanand's thirst.

1016
01:38:58,408 --> 01:39:00,109
He blessed him.

1017
01:39:01,672 --> 01:39:03,962
Since then, he considered
himself as a human being...

1018
01:39:04,696 --> 01:39:06,952
...not as a low caste person.

1019
01:39:09,983 --> 01:39:12,100
But that was in the old days

1020
01:39:14,203 --> 01:39:15,636
Do such things happen in our time?

1021
01:39:21,469 --> 01:39:24,417
Why Sujata?  Such a great
man was born in our time...

1022
01:39:25,344 --> 01:39:27,060
...for the lower
castes all their lives...

1023
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:30,263
...someone dedicated to
stopping injustice from happening.

1024
01:39:30,956 --> 01:39:32,204
Mr. Gandhi.

1025
01:39:34,491 --> 01:39:35,657
haven't you heard...

1026
01:39:35,737 --> 01:39:38,169
...the story about the
low caste girl Lakshmi?

1027
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:42,017
Gandhi treated Lakshmi
as his own daughter...

1028
01:39:42,574 --> 01:39:44,843
...He allowed him to stay
in his Ashram in Ahmedabad.

1029
01:39:45,721 --> 01:39:47,464
Then a big problem arose.

1030
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:51,581
People stopped supporting
the ashram because of that girl.

1031
01:39:51,663 --> 01:39:54,516
But Gandhi did not
change his mind.

1032
01:39:54,549 --> 01:39:56,328
How can a man
belittle another man...

1033
01:39:56,626 --> 01:39:58,134
...that too based on religion?

1034
01:39:59,089 --> 01:40:02,189
He could not bear the
humiliation of this religion.

1035
01:40:02,612 --> 01:40:05,137
He faced the hatred of
those who supported him...

1036
01:40:05,428 --> 01:40:07,697
...but he did not expel
that girl from the ashram.

1037
01:40:08,015 --> 01:40:11,135
Finally, the ashram came to the point where it had to be closed.

1038
01:40:11,578 --> 01:40:14,421
Next, as if by God's blessing...

1039
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:17,327
...The ashram received a grant of 13,000 rupees.

1040
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:20,081
Gandhi's patience paid off.

1041
01:40:22,855 --> 01:40:25,333
why this  why are you crying

1042
01:40:26,916 --> 01:40:28,113
I'm not crying.

1043
01:40:29,795 --> 01:40:31,891
Who can cry when hearing
such a beautiful story?

1044
01:40:42,499 --> 01:40:44,976
Today I feel like everything
here is more beautiful than before.

1045
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:47,453
Don't you feel the same way?

1046
01:41:00,526 --> 01:41:01,607
Sujata!

1047
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:06,180
Why do I like you so much?

1048
01:41:08,982 --> 01:41:14,739
Tell me Sujata.
- We're getting late, let's go.

1049
01:41:17,624 --> 01:41:20,052
Why are you trying to run
away without answering me?

1050
01:41:23,234 --> 01:41:26,071
If I know you like
me the same way...

1051
01:41:26,151 --> 01:41:31,530
"Oh Brother"

1052
01:41:33,502 --> 01:41:38,020
"Listen, friend."

1053
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:43,708
"Ask, my friend."

1054
01:41:53,049 --> 01:41:55,263
Why are you silent?
Won't you answer me?

1055
01:41:59,462 --> 01:42:01,580
do you know?
I saw a dream Sujata

1056
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:04,203
what a dream

1057
01:42:05,282 --> 01:42:07,565
You had a chandramalika flower in your hair.

1058
01:42:08,617 --> 01:42:10,270
There was a red sandalwood mark on the forehead.

1059
01:42:14,228 --> 01:42:15,888
You were wearing a beautiful saree…

1060
01:42:16,504 --> 01:42:19,182
...You stood beside me
like a beautiful statue.

1061
01:42:21,506 --> 01:42:23,658
Tell me, what could be
the meaning of that dream?

1062
01:42:26,598 --> 01:42:28,674
It means you have
beautiful ideas.

1063
01:42:28,902 --> 01:42:30,459
Sujata, don't skip the question.

1064
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:33,628
Tell me, like in that dream,
when will you come to me?

1065
01:42:36,644 --> 01:42:37,848
Any day you like.

1066
01:42:38,672 --> 01:42:46,505
At that moment I will be yours...

1067
01:42:46,585 --> 01:42:54,039
In that moment you will be mine...

1068
01:44:08,035 --> 01:44:09,275
Say it out loud.

1069
01:44:10,936 --> 01:44:14,098
Now I only know the tune.
I can't find the right words.

1070
01:44:14,472 --> 01:44:17,974
Tell me directly that you can't
sing, why do you apologize?

1071
01:44:18,035 --> 01:44:21,226
I promise, Sujatha, as soon as I
get the words, I will sing for you.

1072
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:58,406
Sujata!
- Brother Mahadev?  Come on.

1073
01:45:00,136 --> 01:45:02,398
The husband and wife
have come - and Rama?

1074
01:45:02,571 --> 01:45:04,363
Lady Rama has not come yet.

1075
01:45:14,310 --> 01:45:16,701
Aunt Sujata is looking for someone.

1076
01:45:16,755 --> 01:45:18,720
Now it is not a good thing
to delay this issue any more.

1077
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,305
But he is older than him.
- We don't have time to choose between good and bad.

1078
01:45:24,035 --> 01:45:25,785
Where can we find a
good young man for him?

1079
01:45:26,958 --> 01:45:30,715
I don't like the way Adir
suddenly got up from the drama.

1080
01:45:30,795 --> 01:45:32,035
I don't know what happened.

1081
01:45:32,788 --> 01:45:34,752
Maybe he has
important work to do.

1082
01:45:34,832 --> 01:45:38,080
No, boys are very different these days.

1083
01:45:38,395 --> 01:45:40,320
It is very difficult to
understand their ideas.

1084
01:45:41,135 --> 01:45:45,187
Aunt says Adir is
ready to marry Rama...

1085
01:45:45,995 --> 01:45:48,720
...There is no need to wait
until Rama finishes the exam.

1086
01:45:48,961 --> 01:45:53,368
If Rama can't marry a gem
like Adir, I am very afraid for him.

1087
01:46:42,652 --> 01:46:47,232
hello  - Hello Sujata, I only
remembered the tune at that time.

1088
01:46:47,632 --> 01:46:49,610
Now I found the words, listen.

1089
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:00,109
are you smiling  Apparently
you don't like my song.

1090
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:05,143
No, no, I'm not laughing.

1091
01:51:07,513 --> 01:51:10,843
Everything I told you today
on the river bank was a lie.

1092
01:51:12,288 --> 01:51:17,071
Pure lies please
forget all that.

1093
01:51:17,442 --> 01:51:20,400
What are you talking about Sujata?
- Yes.

1094
01:51:21,438 --> 01:51:25,235
If you want to see me happy,
don't tell aunty any of these things.

1095
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:28,884
Neither he nor my parents want it.

1096
01:51:30,397 --> 01:51:34,816
I'm asking you, don't
ask me about it again.

1097
01:51:35,848 --> 01:51:38,076
Sujata!  Sujata!

1098
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:09,754
Listen, Sujata...

1099
01:52:20,195 --> 01:52:25,218
Monara Ragum Devi;
His eyes are open.

1100
01:52:25,918 --> 01:52:28,547
See the sky absorbed in thought.

1101
01:52:29,135 --> 01:52:33,364
Today my dreams have come true.

1102
01:52:33,909 --> 01:52:36,685
We have joined.

1103
01:52:37,074 --> 01:52:40,490
The music of this rain...
How are you sister?

1104
01:52:40,663 --> 01:52:44,157
do you eat tamarind  - No.
- Eat them, they are very tasty.

1105
01:52:45,653 --> 01:52:49,891
Rama!  Why does Mr. Adir
praise you so much?

1106
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:53,800
who  Mr. Adir, are you praising me?

1107
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:59,301
In any case, you are going to praise
me, why is there something to ask?

1108
01:53:00,434 --> 01:53:04,050
But... Why is Mr. Adir
especially praised?

1109
01:53:07,388 --> 01:53:11,504
Even the cook who
makes the roti praises me.

1110
01:53:14,548 --> 01:53:16,901
No Rama, this is no joke.

1111
01:53:17,601 --> 01:53:22,896
Please think.
- What are you trying to say?

1112
01:53:24,806 --> 01:53:27,582
Good people like Mr. Adir
are very few in this world.

1113
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:29,375
There is no doubt about it.

1114
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:35,418
I'm afraid he will be sad.

1115
01:53:35,877 --> 01:53:39,077
What should I do if he
has inherited sadness?

1116
01:53:39,259 --> 01:53:42,425
Sister, I can't speak any more names.
I'm leaving.

1117
01:54:00,362 --> 01:54:02,419
I brought tea, father.
- Where is mom?

1118
01:54:02,636 --> 01:54:03,762
It's coming too.

1119
01:54:04,815 --> 01:54:06,830
why this  why are you sad

1120
01:54:07,107 --> 01:54:10,756
There's nothing wrong with you, right?
- Nothing like that, dad, I'm fine.

1121
01:54:16,562 --> 01:54:17,856
Aunt just spoke.

1122
01:54:18,072 --> 01:54:21,480
He has decided Sujata's marriage.
- Did he do that?

1123
01:54:22,699 --> 01:54:24,325
At least we didn't see that kiss.

1124
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,625
Don't go creating problems now.

1125
01:54:27,022 --> 01:54:29,503
If Sujata doesn't get married soon...

1126
01:54:29,928 --> 01:54:32,162
...We will also have to postpone
the marriage of Rama and Adir.

1127
01:54:34,373 --> 01:54:35,792
The girls of this time.

1128
01:54:36,164 --> 01:54:39,362
You never know when
they will change their mind.

1129
01:54:39,805 --> 01:54:43,619
If we lose someone so good, I
will not be able to bear my grief.

1130
01:55:16,094 --> 01:55:18,472
I came to talk to you and
make a decision.  If you think...

1131
01:55:18,552 --> 01:55:22,857
Don't make the same mistake
again, I can't marry you.

1132
01:55:23,765 --> 01:55:25,045
why not

1133
01:55:27,414 --> 01:55:29,014
Because it will be a big loss for you.

1134
01:55:30,071 --> 01:55:32,622
I am smart enough to think
about my profit and loss.

1135
01:55:33,469 --> 01:55:35,666
Then why are you
doing such a stupid thing?

1136
01:55:37,197 --> 01:55:39,826
You can find a
better wife than me.

1137
01:55:40,354 --> 01:55:42,814
No, I can't find one.

1138
01:55:46,528 --> 01:55:50,734
You belong to an important family.
You belong to a high caste.

1139
01:55:51,959 --> 01:55:54,494
You know that, right?
- Yes, I know.

1140
01:55:55,738 --> 01:55:57,373
Then you know
your lower caste...

1141
01:55:57,909 --> 01:56:01,377
...that there are many people in castes.
- Yes.

1142
01:56:02,043 --> 01:56:04,188
The thoughts of low people are also very low.

1143
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:06,134
What happened to you Sujata?

1144
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,322
Why are you reading
nonsense today?

1145
01:56:10,363 --> 01:56:12,214
There is a reason for that.
- what?

1146
01:56:15,534 --> 01:56:17,094
I do not belong to your caste.

1147
01:56:19,505 --> 01:56:23,574
Are you trying to say that
you are not related to Mr. Upen?

1148
01:56:25,828 --> 01:56:28,700
There is a blood relation with it...

1149
01:56:29,003 --> 01:56:31,251
...I don't even
belong to his club.

1150
01:56:32,686 --> 01:56:38,974
I belong to a very low caste,
I belong to the lowest caste.

1151
01:56:50,951 --> 01:56:54,013
So?  why don't you talk

1152
01:56:56,253 --> 01:56:58,051
Will you come back to find me?

1153
01:56:59,021 --> 01:57:01,762
Do you want to marry me now?

1154
01:57:13,544 --> 01:57:16,853
Are you trying to scare me, Sujata?
It can't be!

1155
01:57:17,813 --> 01:57:19,424
I don't like that caste discrimination.

1156
01:57:22,224 --> 01:57:25,423
Whoever you are, you are my dream.

1157
01:57:25,692 --> 01:57:28,824
You taught me love, you taught me...

1158
01:57:28,904 --> 01:57:33,624
That's Mr. Adir!
In the name of God, say nothing more.

1159
01:57:34,757 --> 01:57:36,144
I can't stand it.

1160
01:57:40,585 --> 01:57:44,590
You still can't marry me.
- Why is that?

1161
01:57:45,629 --> 01:57:47,999
For what reason do you
say no to my love again?

1162
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:53,041
Is there any secret?
- Yes, there is such a secret.

1163
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,824
what?  - Please don't ask that

1164
01:57:56,882 --> 01:58:01,904
I'm telling you, don't listen again,
I can't stand listening to them.

1165
01:58:04,224 --> 01:58:06,533
Forget about a low
caste girl like me.

1166
01:58:07,519 --> 01:58:11,824
Imagine that the girl
of your dreams died.

1167
01:58:13,269 --> 01:58:16,790
Chandramalika flower is lost.

1168
01:58:35,524 --> 01:58:38,731
Why are you sitting in the dark, son?
- Just.

1169
01:58:40,011 --> 01:58:42,684
You said you can't even go out.

1170
01:58:42,891 --> 01:58:46,446
So where did you just go?
- To Rama's house.

1171
01:58:47,864 --> 01:58:53,227
If so, then you must have received the news.
-what?

1172
01:58:53,538 --> 01:58:57,758
That low caste girl in
their house... Sujata...

1173
01:58:58,528 --> 01:59:00,113
...his marriage decision.

1174
01:59:00,690 --> 01:59:04,885
The boy is poor in his caste but rich.

1175
01:59:05,637 --> 01:59:08,007
Sujath is very happy about it.

1176
01:59:09,667 --> 01:59:14,338
Okay, so you can
rest a bit, I'll hit God.

1177
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:26,209
hello  - Hello Rama,
I'm talking to Adir.

1178
02:00:26,806 --> 02:00:28,769
Sujata wants to talk.
- Hold on.

1179
02:00:40,877 --> 02:00:44,803
hello  - Who is Sujata?
best wishes.

1180
02:00:45,633 --> 02:00:49,432
I heard that you are going
to marry a very rich man.

1181
02:00:49,438 --> 02:00:52,993
In the end, you rejected
my love because of money.

1182
02:00:53,011 --> 02:00:55,789
You know who would give
up everything for money?

1183
02:00:56,002 --> 02:00:57,948
Today I had to believe...

1184
02:00:58,321 --> 02:01:01,789
...that low caste people
only have low thoughts.

1185
02:01:02,118 --> 02:01:04,521
You are the best example of that.

1186
02:01:05,395 --> 02:01:07,323
What are you talking
about, Mr. Adir?

1187
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:10,696
Who messaged you
about my marriage?

1188
02:01:10,886 --> 02:01:12,503
Someone I can trust.

1189
02:01:16,932 --> 02:01:21,447
Then come to my wedding.
- Why is that?

1190
02:01:23,626 --> 02:01:28,019
This low caste girl
rubs on your feet...

1191
02:01:28,737 --> 02:01:35,124
... He will shave his
hair and leave the world.

1192
02:01:36,287 --> 02:01:39,149
Sujata!  Listen Sujata!

1193
02:01:39,832 --> 02:01:43,690
Sujata!  Listen Sujata!

1194
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:47,253
Sujata!

1195
02:02:08,139 --> 02:02:10,215
Grandma!  - Yes, son?

1196
02:02:11,175 --> 02:02:13,580
Do you want me
to get married soon?

1197
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:19,755
What a stupid question, boy!
That's what I live for.

1198
02:02:20,308 --> 02:02:22,364
When will a beautiful
daughter-in-law come to this house?

1199
02:02:22,434 --> 02:02:24,236
So prepare the
necessary things now.

1200
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:27,029
I want to get Dighayu!

1201
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:29,390
I will send a
message to Upen soon

1202
02:02:29,978 --> 02:02:31,993
But Rama's exams...

1203
02:02:32,073 --> 02:02:34,631
I want to marry Sujata, not Rama.

1204
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:36,574
what  what did you say

1205
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:38,851
I want to marry Sujatha.

1206
02:02:42,371 --> 02:02:45,596
Do you know that she is not Upen's daughter?
- Yes.

1207
02:02:46,816 --> 02:02:49,403
And you know he is low caste?
- Yes, I know.

1208
02:02:49,483 --> 02:02:51,330
God is the witness!

1209
02:02:53,944 --> 02:02:58,562
Are you going to marry that
low caste girl in front of my god?

1210
02:02:58,744 --> 02:03:00,698
Go out of my sight, go!

1211
02:03:01,312 --> 02:03:04,953
Is it not your God
who created Sujatawa?

1212
02:03:07,755 --> 02:03:11,604
Like Buddha,
Ramakrishna, Vivekananda...

1213
02:03:12,157 --> 02:03:13,973
...the people you hang around here...

1214
02:03:14,198 --> 02:03:17,170
...never said about caste
differences among people.

1215
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:20,891
Don't read nonsense!
They are important scholars.

1216
02:03:21,323 --> 02:03:23,111
They are great...

1217
02:03:23,125 --> 02:03:25,570
...for thinking that
everyone is human.

1218
02:03:25,716 --> 02:03:27,861
It is a great sin to hate another
human being, grandmother.

1219
02:03:27,941 --> 02:03:29,170
Keep your advice to yourself!

1220
02:03:29,357 --> 02:03:30,770
Come to teach me about religion!

1221
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:34,277
Listen well!  You
can't marry that girl.

1222
02:03:34,331 --> 02:03:36,419
She is a child of low caste parents.

1223
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:40,250
I don't believe it, now
she is Mr. Upen's daughter.

1224
02:03:40,435 --> 02:03:41,770
You mean then she...

1225
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:44,127
Does being born into the
lower castes change them?

1226
02:03:44,551 --> 02:03:46,004
Now then the problem is in the genes?

1227
02:03:46,367 --> 02:03:49,204
Then if a Brahmin child
was adopted by a Shudra...

1228
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:50,917
...and still you think
he is a brahmin?

1229
02:03:50,997 --> 02:03:54,557
No, then his caste will disappear
and then he will be a Shudra.

1230
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:55,863
So I can say...

1231
02:03:55,943 --> 02:03:57,870
...Now Sujata is also
the daughter of a Brahmin

1232
02:03:57,904 --> 02:04:00,507
Because he was brought up by
an important person like Mr. Upen.

1233
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:04,901
A man becomes high and low
according to the way he is raised.

1234
02:04:04,981 --> 02:04:07,617
Shut up!  You can't beat
me with those arguments.

1235
02:04:08,084 --> 02:04:11,490
This is my final decision,
you cannot marry that girl.

1236
02:04:12,261 --> 02:04:13,850
So my final decision is...

1237
02:04:14,354 --> 02:04:16,551
...I will not marry
anyone except Sujatha.

1238
02:04:17,018 --> 02:04:19,170
From today you and
I have no relation.

1239
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:20,490
Run away from my house!

1240
02:04:22,156 --> 02:04:24,793
You have no right to
my property or money.

1241
02:04:37,766 --> 02:04:42,946
my goodness!  Why are you giving
me so much trouble at this old age?

1242
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,784
Lady!  The husband is about to leave

1243
02:04:52,848 --> 02:04:54,316
Lady!

1244
02:04:57,068 --> 02:04:58,824
The husband is really going to leave.

1245
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:01,099
Please hurry lady!

1246
02:05:05,554 --> 02:05:09,238
Adir, where are you going, Adir?

1247
02:05:09,956 --> 02:05:15,846
Wait, are you really going?
- Yes.

1248
02:05:17,126 --> 02:05:19,592
Are you dishonoring your family?

1249
02:05:20,223 --> 02:05:23,189
...because of the desire of
a low caste who is nowhere?

1250
02:05:24,399 --> 02:05:26,397
I don't believe in that caste system.

1251
02:05:26,907 --> 02:05:29,951
Is your faith the only
thing worth to you now?

1252
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:32,191
Is your duty irrelevant now?

1253
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:35,631
You are leaving this
house for a small reason.

1254
02:05:35,711 --> 02:05:42,622
Adir, your mother died
when you were a small boy.

1255
02:05:43,685 --> 02:05:48,431
Since then I raised you.

1256
02:05:50,242 --> 02:05:55,751
I lived because of you.
I forgot about death.

1257
02:05:57,006 --> 02:05:58,182
But you...

1258
02:05:59,047 --> 02:06:04,351
Don't you think
about me even once?

1259
02:06:06,702 --> 02:06:12,618
Don't you think I
have no one but you?

1260
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:23,047
You're Gyothin, I won't
be able to stay a second.

1261
02:06:27,060 --> 02:06:31,688
I accept defeat, please
don't go, children.

1262
02:06:32,976 --> 02:06:34,715
I open my hands.

1263
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:51,633
Mr. Adir!

1264
02:06:54,816 --> 02:06:58,890
This letter has arrived, sir.
- from whom?  - From Sujata.

1265
02:07:02,358 --> 02:07:03,646
you can go

1266
02:07:18,779 --> 02:07:21,379
"Mr. Adir, I am
writing you this letter..."

1267
02:07:21,459 --> 02:07:24,334
"...because I can't say
everything over the phone."

1268
02:07:25,155 --> 02:07:30,760
"It was lucky for me that someone
like you loved a low caste like me."

1269
02:07:31,615 --> 02:07:36,683
"But to make you happy I
have to hurt mom and dad."

1270
02:07:37,851 --> 02:07:40,619
"I wouldn't do that for
anything in the world."

1271
02:07:41,648 --> 02:07:44,709
"They want you to bind Rama."

1272
02:07:45,617 --> 02:07:49,499
"If you want to see me
happy, please marry him."

1273
02:07:49,741 --> 02:07:53,909
"I've been with my mom and
dad all my life and I respect them."

1274
02:07:54,177 --> 02:07:55,336
"Of course."

1275
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:04,772
Charu!  Born!
- Aunt?  Why this time?

1276
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:15,988
No problem?
- No, nothing like that.

1277
02:08:16,429 --> 02:08:21,532
what's the problem  You look tired.
- Yes, I'm tired.

1278
02:08:26,254 --> 02:08:28,390
I am very tired Charu.

1279
02:08:30,491 --> 02:08:35,614
I came to tell you that Adir
wants to get married soon.

1280
02:08:36,495 --> 02:08:39,194
Really, that's good news.

1281
02:08:39,548 --> 02:08:41,823
But Rama's exams are approaching.

1282
02:08:44,003 --> 02:08:50,801
It is Sujathawa that Adir wants to marry, not Rama.
- Sujatava?!

1283
02:08:51,917 --> 02:08:56,854
Doesn't Adir know that Sujata is from low caste?
- He knows.

1284
02:08:58,254 --> 02:08:59,604
He knows everything.

1285
02:08:59,985 --> 02:09:03,534
But why did you allow this injustice?

1286
02:09:04,058 --> 02:09:07,534
I lost, son.

1287
02:09:07,941 --> 02:09:10,086
I had no answer
to Adir's arguments.

1288
02:09:11,668 --> 02:09:15,774
He grew up in this
new world, he learned.

1289
02:09:16,641 --> 02:09:18,534
Maybe he's right.

1290
02:09:19,945 --> 02:09:23,334
Times are changing
Charu, we can't stop it

1291
02:09:24,511 --> 02:09:28,694
But I also cannot change
my thoughts at this age.

1292
02:09:29,684 --> 02:09:34,277
It would be good if I also go to
Kashi and calm myself down a bit.

1293
02:09:36,854 --> 02:09:38,982
Born here.  - What is this aunt?

1294
02:09:39,578 --> 02:09:41,688
These are fifty thousand
rupees worth of bank shares.

1295
02:09:43,107 --> 02:09:46,834
I thought I would give
these to Adir's wife.

1296
02:09:47,915 --> 02:09:51,677
Anyway, I'll leave these
with you to give to Sujata.

1297
02:09:52,707 --> 02:09:57,854
Now it's better to give up
completely on being a loser anyway.

1298
02:10:16,828 --> 02:10:20,141
After everything, why Adir...
- It's not Adir's fault.

1299
02:10:20,530 --> 02:10:22,398
This is the bad girl's fault.

1300
02:10:22,478 --> 02:10:27,448
Is this how she treats our love?

1301
02:10:27,528 --> 02:10:29,385
Why are you angry Charu?
Someone hears.

1302
02:10:29,465 --> 02:10:31,107
She is like a daughter to us.

1303
02:10:31,383 --> 02:10:33,831
Not like a daughter,
she is a poisonous snake!

1304
02:10:34,237 --> 02:10:34,973
Charu!

1305
02:10:35,053 --> 02:10:37,497
I can't see her
dressed like a bride.

1306
02:10:37,577 --> 02:10:39,185
I can't marry a witch...

1307
02:10:39,265 --> 02:10:40,857
...of someone who took away my daughter's rights.

1308
02:10:40,937 --> 02:10:43,691
Shut up Charu!
- Why do I shut up?

1309
02:10:44,590 --> 02:10:47,479
We have created a snake.

1310
02:10:48,214 --> 02:10:50,741
We petted her, but she bit us.
- Charu!

1311
02:10:50,821 --> 02:10:54,179
What happened mom?
- Shut up!  I'm not your mother.

1312
02:10:54,259 --> 02:10:58,593
Get out of here!
I don't want to see your face again.

1313
02:10:58,673 --> 02:11:01,585
Charu!  - Mom!

1314
02:11:01,665 --> 02:11:03,600
Charu!  - Mom!

1315
02:11:04,025 --> 02:11:04,795
mother

1316
02:11:04,875 --> 02:11:08,228
Charu!  - What happened to mom?
- Lady!

1317
02:11:08,514 --> 02:11:10,659
Come on, let's take him to the room.

1318
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:26,944
Look Mr. Upen, he
has a lot of blood...

1319
02:11:27,454 --> 02:11:29,918
...His heart rate is decreasing.

1320
02:11:30,491 --> 02:11:34,816
I think he has a concussion
and we have to be careful.

1321
02:11:35,058 --> 02:11:38,181
Do not let him feel too
much anger or happiness.

1322
02:11:38,414 --> 02:11:40,918
And... come this way.

1323
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:43,785
Nurse!  Check your pulse regularly.
-Okay sir.

1324
02:11:52,537 --> 02:11:56,331
Listen, Mr. Upen, I want to tell you
clearly the condition of the patient...

1325
02:11:56,430 --> 02:11:58,178
...is a bit serious.

1326
02:11:58,258 --> 02:11:59,795
He needs new blood soon.

1327
02:11:59,875 --> 02:12:02,346
I'm ready, take my blood.  - No.

1328
02:12:02,822 --> 02:12:05,304
First we need to see
what his blood type is.

1329
02:12:05,667 --> 02:12:07,206
Next, matching his blood...

1330
02:12:07,286 --> 02:12:09,358
...He wants to take blood
from someone who has blood.

1331
02:12:09,740 --> 02:12:12,214
Ask the laboratory inspector
to come immediately.

1332
02:12:12,586 --> 02:12:17,178
Doctor!  The patient cannot breathe.
- I am coming.

1333
02:12:17,567 --> 02:12:19,558
Listen, don't waste a second.

1334
02:12:21,113 --> 02:12:23,302
I will do it, stay with him.

1335
02:12:35,763 --> 02:12:38,171
No, his blood is not compatible.

1336
02:12:38,896 --> 02:12:41,231
Doctor, the patient's
pulse is gone.

1337
02:12:41,421 --> 02:12:43,393
Prepare a choramine injection.

1338
02:12:47,682 --> 02:12:49,827
What do we do now?
- I don't understand.

1339
02:12:50,251 --> 02:12:51,609
We need to find blood soon.

1340
02:12:52,699 --> 02:12:56,132
Is there no one else here?
- Please, look at my blood.

1341
02:12:58,822 --> 02:13:01,736
Sujata, you...
- Yes, father

1342
02:13:02,142 --> 02:13:05,713
Come, sit here.
Sahani, look at the blood...

1343
02:13:05,793 --> 02:13:07,523
...I will give the injection
to the patient until then.

1344
02:13:35,994 --> 02:13:37,371
So doctor?

1345
02:13:40,787 --> 02:13:42,957
His blood matches the
patient's blood exactly.

1346
02:13:43,269 --> 02:13:44,808
Same type.  - Thank God!

1347
02:13:45,275 --> 02:13:47,532
Come on, let's not waste time.

1348
02:13:47,722 --> 02:13:48,846
Come on, Dr. Sahani.

1349
02:15:10,872 --> 02:15:14,272
He is fine now, let him rest.

1350
02:15:15,283 --> 02:15:18,691
Call me at noon and tell me about his condition.

1351
02:15:19,305 --> 02:15:20,412
Nurse!

1352
02:15:28,258 --> 02:15:32,177
You've been up all night.  Go and rest.
- Okay.

1353
02:15:42,590 --> 02:15:45,497
Hello, hello doctor, I
am talking to Rama.

1354
02:15:45,687 --> 02:15:47,780
You said to inform
about mother's condition.

1355
02:15:49,976 --> 02:15:52,364
Mom has no problem
now, she is sleeping now.

1356
02:15:53,402 --> 02:15:57,052
OK, I'll tell dad then
I'll leave it, doctor.

1357
02:16:02,353 --> 02:16:05,078
Last night I was
troubled by this question.

1358
02:16:05,312 --> 02:16:09,496
what is that  - How did Sujata's
blood match Charu's blood...

1359
02:16:09,576 --> 02:16:11,298
You think even blood...

1360
02:16:11,765 --> 02:16:15,922
...like people are
divided into high and low?

1361
02:16:16,885 --> 02:16:18,666
What are you guys talking about?

1362
02:16:20,509 --> 02:16:23,639
He is fine now.
I will go home for a while.

1363
02:16:29,002 --> 02:16:30,402
What was Adir saying?

1364
02:16:30,482 --> 02:16:34,028
Charu defeated Sujata.
- Who?  - All of us.

1365
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:36,223
You wanted fresh blood.

1366
02:16:36,577 --> 02:16:40,482
Neither mine nor Adir's nor
Rama's blood was compatible.

1367
02:16:40,876 --> 02:16:43,202
But Sujata's blood...
- What are you talking about?

1368
02:16:45,002 --> 02:16:47,294
Did Sujata save me by giving her blood?

1369
02:16:47,374 --> 02:16:49,145
Don't get up... lie down.

1370
02:16:50,684 --> 02:16:57,118
But...how did his
blood match mine?

1371
02:16:57,198 --> 02:17:01,053
Don't ask me that, sir.
Only God can answer that.

1372
02:17:01,961 --> 02:17:06,042
He is the one who made me,
made you and made Sujatawa.

1373
02:17:06,347 --> 02:17:08,722
Maybe he treated
everyone the same.

1374
02:17:10,056 --> 02:17:13,100
We lost very badly, Charu.

1375
02:17:13,775 --> 02:17:17,027
After Sujata saved you
by giving her blood...

1376
02:17:17,355 --> 02:17:19,708
...Now he doesn't owe us anything

1377
02:17:20,434 --> 02:17:22,960
He paid us back for
everything we did to him.

1378
02:17:25,432 --> 02:17:30,673
It's true, now we have no
reason to be angry with it.

1379
02:17:32,128 --> 02:17:36,038
where is he  - In that room,
the doctor told him to rest.

1380
02:17:36,824 --> 02:17:38,041
Shall I call him?

1381
02:17:40,050 --> 02:17:41,494
No, not now.

1382
02:17:48,189 --> 02:17:49,417
Sujata!

1383
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:00,504
Was what you wrote in your letter true?

1384
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:06,413
Won't your decision change?
- No.

1385
02:18:08,056 --> 02:18:10,192
It's a shame you sent your aunt here.

1386
02:18:12,657 --> 02:18:15,987
I can't marry you.  - why?

1387
02:18:18,599 --> 02:18:20,969
It was because of me that mother faced this trouble.

1388
02:18:22,223 --> 02:18:27,057
didn't you hear
My breath is poison.

1389
02:18:30,196 --> 02:18:34,555
Please go to save
yourself from that poison.

1390
02:18:49,507 --> 02:18:51,030
Are you saying goodbye to me with those words?

1391
02:18:52,526 --> 02:18:57,093
Say nothing else?
- I want to say.

1392
02:18:58,926 --> 02:19:03,933
Then tell Sujata.
- Before you go, promise me something.

1393
02:19:05,022 --> 02:19:10,626
That you forget me and hate me.

1394
02:19:13,197 --> 02:19:18,706
I'm leaving, but I don't
think I can hate you.

1395
02:19:19,839 --> 02:19:21,940
There is no room for hate in my love.

1396
02:19:24,119 --> 02:19:27,527
Sujata, you made a
mistake by loving me.

1397
02:19:27,717 --> 02:19:33,583
Yes, I was stupid
and I made a mistake.

1398
02:19:34,592 --> 02:19:37,665
That mistake of yours
now helps me survive.

1399
02:19:39,316 --> 02:19:43,657
I have no other way,
I have no other refuge.

1400
02:19:45,431 --> 02:19:49,496
Agree to what I
say and marry Rama.

1401
02:19:50,188 --> 02:19:51,805
You will be happy.

1402
02:19:52,324 --> 02:19:54,823
Don't insult me ​​with
such things, Sujata.

1403
02:19:56,362 --> 02:19:58,239
I cannot deceive Rama.

1404
02:19:59,641 --> 02:20:02,062
It is not a problem to be
deceived like this and bear it.

1405
02:20:04,830 --> 02:20:06,948
I will never see you again.

1406
02:20:18,373 --> 02:20:22,991
Here is your letter, what is
the use of this for me now?

1407
02:20:27,012 --> 02:20:32,781
Please forgive me, tell me
you forgive me before you go.

1408
02:20:34,302 --> 02:20:37,044
I can't spoil mommy
and daddy's happiness.

1409
02:20:37,805 --> 02:20:39,612
I can't hurt them.

1410
02:21:02,989 --> 02:21:05,842
Charu, Sujata has failed us once again.

1411
02:21:06,128 --> 02:21:09,102
He uprooted our mane first.

1412
02:21:09,448 --> 02:21:11,057
Here, read this letter.

1413
02:21:14,425 --> 02:21:21,427
"But to make you happy I
have to hurt mom and dad."

1414
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:25,561
"I wouldn't do it for
anything in the world."

1415
02:21:29,877 --> 02:21:31,312
We are defeated sir.

1416
02:21:31,519 --> 02:21:34,097
But I feel happy
about our defeat today.

1417
02:21:35,653 --> 02:21:38,040
Tell me really
Charu this is really...

1418
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:42,624
...are the words of Sujata whom
we thought was our daughter?

1419
02:21:43,462 --> 02:21:45,953
He is even better...

1420
02:21:46,601 --> 02:21:51,145
Today I understand
how much Sujata loves us.

1421
02:21:52,881 --> 02:21:54,825
He showed us our mistakes.

1422
02:21:56,220 --> 02:22:00,560
Talk to him, please, talk to him.
- Dad!

1423
02:22:02,688 --> 02:22:03,941
Dad!

1424
02:22:12,823 --> 02:22:13,870
I brought you tea.

1425
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:17,165
Why talk out loud?  Get in.

1426
02:22:18,107 --> 02:22:23,928
No, I'm not letting my
bad shadow fall on mom.

1427
02:22:24,464 --> 02:22:28,719
Talk... talk to him.
- Come Sujata.

1428
02:22:37,575 --> 02:22:40,455
why are you standing
Leave it and sit down.

1429
02:22:48,931 --> 02:22:53,246
Not there, Sujata is right
here on the other side of me.

1430
02:23:03,504 --> 02:23:07,145
did you hear  Adir
wants to marry you.

1431
02:23:08,787 --> 02:23:11,771
No, mom, no.  - why?

1432
02:23:13,224 --> 02:23:17,305
I will never marry, I
will always be with you.

1433
02:23:18,361 --> 02:23:24,735
Every girl gets married Sujata.
- No, marry Rama.

1434
02:23:26,015 --> 02:23:30,339
Rama is married, but you
should be married too, Sujata.

1435
02:23:32,449 --> 02:23:36,237
You're like our...
- Mom!  Don't say that!

1436
02:23:36,921 --> 02:23:39,290
Don't say that, mom.
- Listen...

1437
02:23:40,173 --> 02:23:46,573
Like a daughter to us!
I can't take it mom, I can't.

1438
02:23:46,653 --> 02:23:48,225
You are not like our daughter.

1439
02:23:49,151 --> 02:23:53,354
You are our daughter, yes our daughter.

1440
02:23:54,468 --> 02:23:59,746
what did you say
Please say that again.

1441
02:23:59,826 --> 02:24:02,901
Yes, you are our daughter.

1442
02:24:05,219 --> 02:24:09,329
Mom!  Mom!  - Son!

1443
02:24:09,409 --> 02:24:15,612
Say that again mom!  I
couldn't wait to hear it.

1444
02:24:17,085 --> 02:24:20,718
Mom!  Mom!

1445
02:24:22,711 --> 02:24:25,838
Hey why is this?  what's the problem

1446
02:24:26,655 --> 02:24:28,095
Why are you all crying?

1447
02:24:28,434 --> 02:24:31,225
We are not crying,
Sujata is crying.

1448
02:24:31,644 --> 02:24:33,900
why are you crying sister

1449
02:24:34,834 --> 02:24:36,750
He cries knowing about his marriage

1450
02:24:37,518 --> 02:24:41,095
His marriage?
with whom  - With Adir.

1451
02:24:41,324 --> 02:24:44,022
what  With Mr. Adir?
You don't understand mom.

1452
02:24:45,446 --> 02:24:48,166
He's not crying mom,
he's smiling mom.

1453
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:50,505
Look at this sister sister!

1454
02:24:52,594 --> 02:24:53,701
Look at this.

1455
02:24:55,985 --> 02:24:58,352
Look mom, sister is smiling.

1456
02:24:59,266 --> 02:25:02,932
Look sister, look at this.

1457
02:25:05,561 --> 02:25:07,691
You know son...

1458
02:25:08,515 --> 02:25:09,888
...we kept trying...

1459
02:25:09,968 --> 02:25:13,338
...to send you out of
our house but we couldn't.

1460
02:25:14,092 --> 02:25:17,019
In the end, you will really
be separated from us.

1461
02:25:18,050 --> 02:25:19,174
Mom!

1462
02:25:25,426 --> 02:25:27,426
Come on son, you're getting late.
