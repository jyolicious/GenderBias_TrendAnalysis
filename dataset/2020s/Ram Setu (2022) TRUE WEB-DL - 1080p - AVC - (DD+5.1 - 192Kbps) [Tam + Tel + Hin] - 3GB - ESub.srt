1
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:12,975
Turn the cannon towards the statue.

2
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:15,742
Done, sir.

3
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,767
3...

4
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,475
2...

5
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:21,434
1...

6
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,934
Fire!

7
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:46,684
Six years ago
in Bamyan, Afhanistan

8
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:51,475
Taliban committed a major
crime against humanity.

9
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:57,142
The massive Lord Buddha statues
were bombed and blown to pieces

10
00:03:57,225 --> 00:04:00,850
destroying an integral
part of our cultural inheritance.

11
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,770
Under the supervision of UNESCO,

12
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,687
an international team of archaeologists

13
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:10,225
will arrive and restore what's
left of the heritage structure.

14
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:14,934
They will excavate the
scattered remnants of the idols

15
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:17,892
to build the Lord
Buddha statue once again.

16
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:19,434
On this mission

17
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:24,559
we have archaeologists from Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Japan and India.

18
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,767
[Speaking in foreign language]

19
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,392
Welcome to Bamyan.

20
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:55,267
I don't see our Indian guest
Mr. Aryan...

21
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:59,059
don't tell me you abandoned
him at the LOC, Mr. Bilawal?

22
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,059
Would I dare to?

23
00:05:01,142 --> 00:05:04,350
Your guest is sitting beside the pilot,
inside the cockpit.

24
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:08,184
As usual India wants to
be in 'control' of everything!

25
00:05:10,684 --> 00:05:11,767
Mister...

26
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:14,809
I wasn't controlling him,
I was trying to convince him.

27
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:18,642
Our pilot was scared to fly here.

28
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,309
He said, Bamyan is dangerous territory

29
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,059
and it's not safe to
fly down in a helicopter

30
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:26,559
as the Taliban could bomb it.

31
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,600
We couldn't possibly have driven down,

32
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,017
so I held his hands

33
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,809
and gave a long, emotional speech...
to inspire him.

34
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,350
Did your speech work its magic?

35
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,142
No.

36
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,934
The 100 dollars I gave him
after the speech, worked its magic!

37
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:43,684
I'm adding that to my Expense account.

38
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,309
Sure.

39
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:48,350
But your pilot wasn't wrong.

40
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,559
The Americans too are
scared of patrolling this area.

41
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:54,392
We aren't here to patrol the area,

42
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:57,975
we're here to restore the
lost inheritance of Afghanistan.

43
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:01,100
We have to overcome our fears...

44
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:02,687
am I right, Bilawal?

45
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:03,850
Absolutely, Mister-know-it-all.

46
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,729
After Lord Buddha, you're the second
person who has attained enlightenment.

47
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,600
Go on, make fun of me.

48
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,934
Let's go.

49
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,850
The ear of the statue has been found.

50
00:06:58,809 --> 00:06:59,850
Here it is!

51
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:05,017
It must've gotten buried
here when the statue was bombed.

52
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,600
Wonderful!

53
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:07,892
Bilawal...

54
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,100
What is it?

55
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,725
There's a metallic object under this...

56
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,392
There's something here.

57
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,184
Did you just find a landmine?

58
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,350
You know what, we should
hand over this trench to the army.

59
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,850
Let them pull off this stunt.

60
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,809
Why do you Pakistanis call
the army for every little thing?

61
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,350
They won't be able to handle this.

62
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,475
They'll destroy this site!

63
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:33,517
We'll have to do it ourselves...
carefully.

64
00:07:58,847 --> 00:07:59,809
Pull it out.

65
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:02,428
Pull it out.

66
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,517
Tamiko.

67
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,975
Tamiko... come down.

68
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,559
We've found something!

69
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,017
Come.

70
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:56,975
Brahmi script.

71
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:00,642
This is an ancient Indian script.

72
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:03,850
You might just have found the
treasure looted by Mohammad Ghori.

73
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,017
No...

74
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:07,392
this dates back to an earlier period.

75
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:10,809
Dahir Sen was the last Hindu king
of Sindh, in the 7th century.

76
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,642
These coins are from his time.

77
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:16,934
People from Raja Dahir's
kingdom might have travelled here.

78
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,975
This area was a part of the Silk Route.

79
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:27,184
Taliban are here!

80
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,100
[Speaking in foreign language]

81
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,850
[Speaking in foreign language]

82
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,350
The Taliban are here... run!

83
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:38,267
Taliban are here!
Run!

84
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,225
Let's go, Mr. Aryan...
the Taliban are here.

85
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:00,729
We'll collect the coins later,
let's leave right now.

86
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,434
These are not mere coins, Bilawal.

87
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,434
Dahir Sen was the
king of your Sindh too!

88
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:06,892
This is a priceless legacy
belonging to your country.

89
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,809
His will get me killed in
the name of the country!

90
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:09,975
Hurry up!

91
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:11,309
Let's go.

92
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,892
Tamiko, sit in the car.

93
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:18,892
Let's go. Fast!

94
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:33,934
It's dangerous to stay here.

95
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:35,517
Where can we go?

96
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,475
Let's take refuge in Buddha.

97
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,517
What do you mean?

98
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,184
Come on, let's go.

99
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,600
Hurry up!

100
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,934
Reclining Buddha!

101
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:16,225
Let's take refuge in Buddha.

102
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,687
Thanks to Dr.
Aryan Kulshreshtha's bravery

103
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,809
these priceless antiques
could be saved from the Taliban.

104
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:43,767
King Dahir's coins are an
invaluable part of Pakistan's legacy.

105
00:12:44,225 --> 00:12:46,434
On behalf of the Pakistani government,

106
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,225
I thank Dr. Aryan...

107
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:52,017
As we fell into the ravine,

108
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,350
we discovered a statue of Lord Buddha

109
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:56,809
...the reclining Buddha.

110
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,184
Again, it is because of
Dr. Aryan's courage

111
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:01,975
that we made this new discovery.

112
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:04,017
Wasn't only me...
both of us were there.

113
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:09,600
Not just for Pakistan and Afghanistan,

114
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:14,434
Dr. Aryan has worked very
hard to restore South Asian heritage.

115
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:20,850
Therefore, we will give half
the treasure to India.

116
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:23,687
Thank you so much.

117
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,934
Mr. Habibullah...

118
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:28,809
King Dahir was a Hindu ruler...

119
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,684
while Afghanistan and
Pakistan are Islamic states.

120
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,767
In that case, you should handover
the entire treasure to India.

121
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Don't you agree?

122
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:40,017
Don't you like peace among
neighbouring countries?

123
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:46,850
Mister... these coins are
a part of our common inheritance.

124
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,350
They can't be divided
according to religion.

125
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,934
Religion divides...
while culture unites.

126
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:56,559
Tell me, Dr. Kulshreshtha...

127
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,809
Don't you believe in religion? In God?

128
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,267
I don't believe in religion,
God or any theory

129
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,975
that can't be proven.

130
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,059
I'm a man of facts.

131
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:07,642
History. Archaeology.

132
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:12,559
I believe only in things that
can be proven, okay.

133
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:13,934
Thank you.

134
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,267
Good morning.

135
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,934
Why did you have to
make a speech on religion?

136
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:28,642
Read what's written in the newspapers
instead of your success story.

137
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,267
Forget the newspaper,
take a look at this paper.

138
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,392
Your husband has been
promoted by the ASI.

139
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,809
That's wonderful.
Congratulations, my Lord.

140
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,892
You're calling your atheist
husband a Lord, professor.

141
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:42,642
People might get offended.

142
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,059
Is Kabir still sleeping?

143
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,350
Kabir?

144
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,809
I'm here, Dad.

145
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,767
You're on the sofa!

146
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:51,687
Which comic book are you reading, son?

147
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,934
Baby Ganesha.

148
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,850
-Kabir--
-Nice!

149
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:56,309
Go get ready for school.

150
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,975
Why the sudden change in expression?

151
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:00,267
That's not just a comic book,

152
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,309
that's you trying to
get Kabir to believe in God!

153
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:03,350
I know you very well.

154
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,142
Should I make him an
atheist like you instead?

155
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,309
Read the praises being heaped on you...

156
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:08,684
they're slandering you.

157
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:11,475
-And you want--
-Okay... let's not fight.

158
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:15,267
It's my first day in office
as Joint-Director General.

159
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,809
Be nice to me.

160
00:15:18,142 --> 00:15:19,309
-Bye.
-Bye.

161
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:23,309
Don't demolish Ram Setu!

162
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:27,017
As you can see, a large number of people
have gathered here today,

163
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,850
to oppose the Sethusamudram Project.

164
00:15:29,934 --> 00:15:31,100
According to the project,

165
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,850
the Indian government
and some private organizations

166
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,434
will demolish Ram Setu to construct
a shipping canal in its place

167
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:41,517
to provide a shorter
shipping route for trading.

168
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,392
According to the people,
Ram Setu was constructed by Lord Ram

169
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:48,725
and is part of our cultural legacy...

170
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,975
it should therefore not be destroyed.

171
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:57,225
Don't demolish, don't demolish.
Don't demolish Ram Setu!

172
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:02,934
Don't demolish, don't demolish.
Don't demolish Ram Setu!

173
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't demolish, don't demolish.
Don't demolish Ram bridge!

174
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:32,350
Don't demolish, don't demolish.
Don't demolish Ram Setu!

175
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,770
We immediately need to file a reply

176
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,475
in the honorable Supreme Court.

177
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:41,975
We?

178
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,017
Mr Indrakant,
the government will file the reply.

179
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:47,684
We are simply giving you an update.

180
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,600
Sathe,

181
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,267
I invested in this project

182
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,017
because you and your cabinet
had given me assurance...

183
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,392
now you're giving me an 'update'?!

184
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:03,517
Sir... it is just a small headache.

185
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:07,725
Someone has filed a public
interest litigation in Court saying-

186
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,517
The Sethusamudram Project will offend
the religious sentiment of the people.

187
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,809
We will challenge this.

188
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,267
This country has
deep faith in Shree Ram.

189
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:24,517
How will you challenge this sentiment?

190
00:17:26,142 --> 00:17:28,059
I have a plan...

191
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,850
Sir, I'll need some
time to study the Ram Setu.

192
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:43,267
I'll have to go on an expedition--

193
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,809
We don't have time for that, Aryan.

194
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:48,684
All the government needs is an affidavit

195
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,687
stating that Ram Setu wasn't built by
Shree Ram, that it's a natural construction.

196
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,975
Guess what, you've been highly
recommended to make this report.

197
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,184
Thank you very much,
sir, but I need to research--

198
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,309
Go ahead.

199
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,892
You've written a thesis
on marine archaeology after all!

200
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,184
Do you believe in God?

201
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:02,850
No, sir.

202
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:03,975
-Exactly.
-But--

203
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,767
That's the reason you're
the perfect guy to do this report.

204
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,729
You're not religiously inclined,

205
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:12,600
therefore you'll be
able to see the truth.

206
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,850
See... Ram Setu--

207
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,684
Is created by the
process of sedimentation.

208
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,225
I know, sir, but to prove it--

209
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:18,392
Prove it?

210
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,142
You don't have to prove anything...

211
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,850
you simply need to state it.

212
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,267
The ASI is an authority on this matter.

213
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,100
What we say is considered a fact.

214
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:29,475
You can't go to Afghanistan
for a month anyway...

215
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,434
I mean, they're securing the site.

216
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:35,100
Might as well serve your
country in the meanwhile.

217
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,267
Congratulations, young man...

218
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:40,642
Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha, Joint Director.

219
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:51,850
Professor!

220
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,559
Professor...

221
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,267
Where are you?

222
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,687
Please give me a cup
of tea, professor...

223
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,100
Tea?

224
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:03,434
You shouldn't even be given food today!

225
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,434
What kind of report is this?

226
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:08,225
Do you want our family
to be thrown out of the country?

227
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,809
Why are you reading my report?

228
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:14,600
It was in the printer,
that's why I read it.

229
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,100
Aryan, how can you say that Shree Ram
has no connection to the Ram Setu?

230
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,975
I am only saying that Ram Setu
is not a man-made structure.

231
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:24,225
That's it!

232
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:26,600
No, what you're doing
is what happened in Ayodhya...

233
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:29,017
How are Ram Setu and
Ayodhya related, Gayatri?

234
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,184
Both are connected to belief, Dr. Aryan.

235
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:34,059
Just like Ayodhya connects the
country to the birthplace of Shree Ram,

236
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:37,892
Ram Setu is the bridge that connects their
beliefs to the principles of Shree Ram.

237
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,267
This is a baseless argument, professor.

238
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,729
Ayodhya was a matter of land dispute.

239
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,017
No!
It was a matter of faith.

240
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,309
Just like Ram Setu.

241
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:49,475
Some people in Ayodhya made the mistake of
asking for Shree Ram's birth certificate...

242
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,559
remember what happened?

243
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:53,059
But I'm not asking for
Shree Ram's birth certificate!

244
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:54,350
You're not asking for one...

245
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:57,184
in fact, you're giving a
certificate stating he didn't exist!

246
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:58,475
Which is even more dangerous.

247
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,434
Oh, come on.

248
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:00,642
Aryan...

249
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:03,559
your report questions the
existence of Shree Ram in history...

250
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:05,142
Don't do this.

251
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,809
Please.
Listen to me for once.

252
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:09,729
I am simply doing my job, Gayatri.

253
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,725
I'm not here to question
Shree Ram's history.

254
00:20:13,642 --> 00:20:15,809
Ram Setu is part of Shree Ram's history.

255
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,142
You've called 'Valmiki Ramayan' an epic,
in your report.

256
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,975
But for the people,
it is part of history

257
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:22,975
and Ram Setu is a part of that history.

258
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:25,225
'Valmiki Ramayan' is merely
a piece of literature...

259
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:26,642
Do you have any other proof?

260
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:28,892
Isn't literature proof enough?

261
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,225
The Mughals believed in the 'Ramayan'

262
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,475
and considered Shree Ram
a part of Indian history.

263
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,142
Humayun's wife commissioned
paintings of the 'Ramayan'...

264
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:39,559
Akbar had got the 'Ramayan'
translated to Persian...

265
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:42,517
in fact, coins had also been issued...
Siyaram coins!

266
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,225
Please don't teach me my job, Gayatri.

267
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,142
That's what I'm saying, Dr. Aryan-

268
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:48,559
this is not your job!

269
00:20:48,642 --> 00:20:50,600
Your job is digging up graves...

270
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,600
not to question the
belief of the people.

271
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,100
When will you understand this?

272
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,988
In the Supreme court,
the government submitted

273
00:20:57,068 --> 00:20:59,793
Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha's
report on Sethusamudram today.

274
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:03,957
The report states, Ram Setu wasn't
built by any person or Lord Ram...

275
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:06,457
Rather it is a result
of natural phenomenon.

276
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,665
This report also states that
the 'Ramayan' is an imaginary epic.

277
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:13,165
Belief cannot replace science

278
00:21:13,248 --> 00:21:16,207
therefore, this epic
cannot be considered history.

279
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:20,373
My Lord, the petitioner believes
that around seven thousand years ago,

280
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:22,290
Shree Ram, the king of Ayodhya,

281
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,623
had built the Ram Setu.

282
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:26,013
My question is,

283
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,969
in which engineering
college all this is taught?

284
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:35,373
There is no proof that Shree Ram or
Ram Setu actually existed in history.

285
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:37,498
My Lord, denying the
existence of Shree Ram

286
00:21:37,582 --> 00:21:39,957
is like denying the existence
of the Indian civilization.

287
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:42,707
This is an attack on
the very foundation of India.

288
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:44,457
As you can see,

289
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,123
the argument on Ram Setu is not
just limited to the Supreme Court...

290
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,165
it has reached the common man as well.

291
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:53,248
Our government is in a
hurry to demolish the bridge,

292
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:55,582
they're not willing
to study it properly.

293
00:21:55,748 --> 00:22:00,832
I go fishing near Ram Setu.

294
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:05,832
We worship this Setu
that was built by Lord Ram.

295
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,873
The Court asked the
government to introspect

296
00:22:09,123 --> 00:22:11,832
and reconsider the
contents of this affidavit

297
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,082
which could be detrimental to the
cultural harmony of the nation.

298
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,582
First it was Ayodhya,

299
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,707
now it is Ram Setu.

300
00:22:18,832 --> 00:22:22,248
Some anti-Hindus want
to toy with our history,

301
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,832
beliefs and traditions.

302
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:26,832
If they come to demolish it,

303
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:29,040
we will stand in front
of it and protect it!

304
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,707
The Court directs the government to

305
00:22:31,998 --> 00:22:36,082
provide scientific evidence
to substantiate their claim

306
00:22:36,707 --> 00:22:39,082
that Ram Setu is a natural formation

307
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:40,832
and not a man-made structure.

308
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:43,290
The Indian government
is answerable for this.

309
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:46,915
Someone will have to
pay the price for this.

310
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:50,582
Sir, I made the report after
showing it to the legal team.

311
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:53,248
Why didn't you send it to
the ministry first for approval,

312
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:54,832
before sending it to the lawyers?

313
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,082
Aryan, I only asked you to state
that Ram Setu is a natural formation.

314
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,415
But you have raised questions on the
historical significance of the 'Ramayan'.

315
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,665
Why did you have to
call the 'Ramayan' an epic?

316
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,540
All hell has broken loose now.

317
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:12,290
Sir, I was simply arguing that every
incident mentioned in the 'Ramayan'

318
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:14,123
can't be believed to
have actually taken place.

319
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:15,373
I was going for the jugular.

320
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:17,290
Now they are going for the jugular.

321
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:19,290
Aryan, why don't you understand...

322
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:20,960
you know it, I know it...

323
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,165
in this country,

324
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,707
people believe that literature is also
a part of historical records.

325
00:23:25,832 --> 00:23:26,790
Okay!

326
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,915
I will not be the scapegoat...

327
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:32,040
you have to lie low for some time.

328
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,040
Are you suspending me?

329
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,790
Thank your stars
it's only a suspension

330
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,790
and not a departmental enquiry.

331
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,832
Do you know, the government
had to withdraw the affidavit...

332
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,290
apologize to the people...

333
00:23:43,373 --> 00:23:44,832
Do you know how embarrassing it is?

334
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,998
I'm getting late, Aryan.

335
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:50,790
Hurry up and give
Kabir's lunchbox, please.

336
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:53,707
Okay... The toast is ready,
I'm making the omelet...

337
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,748
You eat the omelet,
I'm getting late for my lecture.

338
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,082
Sorry.

339
00:23:58,207 --> 00:23:59,752
Don't be. Toast is fine.

340
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:01,498
I'm not talking about the toast.

341
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,457
I'm apologizing because I
didn't pay heed to what you said.

342
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,832
Don't think about it too much.

343
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:09,540
Now stay away from
this controversy. Okay?

344
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,293
Okay.

345
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:11,915
-And rest properly today.
-Okay.

346
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,040
Listen, the maid won't
come for work today...

347
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,540
you'll manage, right?

348
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:17,623
And what about my rest?

349
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,582
You can rest after
you finish all the work!

350
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:22,457
Bye.

351
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,674
Kabir!

352
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:25,832
Let's go...

353
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,290
Because of the
Sethusamudram controversy,

354
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:50,998
the government has suspended
Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha...

355
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,790
a senior ASI officer.

356
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,915
His views on the 'Ramayan',
in the government report

357
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,332
is the reason behind this decision.

358
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:02,123
His report has angered the nation...

359
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:04,373
Yes, sir?

360
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:05,623
What are you doing, Aryan?

361
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:07,207
I'm cleaning the house, sir.

362
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,623
What can I do for you, sir?

363
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:10,665
I'm feeling really bad for you.

364
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,998
The government has over-reacted...

365
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,207
You know how politics is.

366
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:19,165
Hard decisions need to be
made under pressure from the public.

367
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:20,293
But mind you,

368
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:22,748
your work has not gone unnoticed.

369
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,707
Some bigwigs are very
happy with your report.

370
00:25:27,373 --> 00:25:28,790
And who are these bigwigs, sir?

371
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:33,790
Come and meet me at Le Regency at 12.

372
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:35,748
I want you to meet someone.

373
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,373
Come with me, Aryan.

374
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,752
Let's go.
He's waiting for you.

375
00:25:55,832 --> 00:25:57,040
In fact, he had just called...

376
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,790
Twice.

377
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:03,332
Sir, isn't Pushpak
Shipping a private company?

378
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,457
They're very close to the government.

379
00:26:05,582 --> 00:26:07,665
They're pretty much
the government themselves.

380
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:11,040
I met Mr. Indrakant
through the minister.

381
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:13,457
Big man... very big man.

382
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:20,415
Are you getting late
for something, Aryan?

383
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:23,832
Sorry, sir...
I will go home and cook.

384
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:26,790
Hello.

385
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:29,373
Sir, Aryan.

386
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,373
I have heard a lot about you.

387
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:47,707
Being an archaeologist,
you must be fond of old things.

388
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:50,790
This is a model of my new ship.

389
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:55,332
I would proudly say,
this is the best ship on water!

390
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:57,790
But there is a small issue.

391
00:26:57,998 --> 00:27:00,040
It is a fuel-guzzler!

392
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:04,665
I had thought the shipping
route would get shorter

393
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
because of the Sethusamudram Project.

394
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:10,832
It'll reduce the
travelling time by 36 hours

395
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,957
and distance by 400 nautical miles.

396
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:17,540
It would save time and fuel...

397
00:27:17,623 --> 00:27:19,457
and the country would
profit from this.

398
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:22,540
I don't know why these
people are against progress.

399
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:25,498
Influencing mob shouting slogans!

400
00:27:26,332 --> 00:27:28,457
Sir, this is why our
country is lagging behind.

401
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,207
They've embroiled Ram Setu
in a religious controversy,

402
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:32,790
hampering progress.

403
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:35,790
I've read your report, Aryan.

404
00:27:36,665 --> 00:27:38,998
It was an honest and true report.

405
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:44,373
I want you to write
another report on this...

406
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,582
more detailed, well-researched
with scientific evidence.

407
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:51,457
So that we can submit
in Supreme Court.

408
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:55,623
But my report will have no value, sir.

409
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:57,832
I have been suspended by the ASI.

410
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:00,790
ASI!

411
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:04,790
It can suspend an archaeologist
but not the truth.

412
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:06,915
Well said, sir.
Well said!

413
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,790
I will help you...

414
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:13,165
for an archaeological
expedition to Ram Setu.

415
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,457
Do your research
and collect evidence...

416
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,415
and scientifically prove that
Ram Setu is not a man-made structure.

417
00:28:21,998 --> 00:28:25,707
Sir will provide you with
facilities that the ASI cannot.

418
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,040
I have deep-sea access.

419
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,540
The government will help us...

420
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:33,082
this is the time to go for the truth!

421
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:41,707
Your offer is great, sir.

422
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:43,707
But

423
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:47,665
the people of this country
don't want to hear the truth,

424
00:28:47,748 --> 00:28:50,665
they only want to hear
what they think is the truth.

425
00:28:53,873 --> 00:28:56,498
I don't want to be
a part of this controversy.

426
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,540
I just want to stay
away from all this.

427
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,540
You had questioned the sanctity
of the 'Ramayan' in your report.

428
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:09,498
Your very name is a controversy now.

429
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,123
You may stay away from it

430
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,165
but the controversy
will not stay away from you.

431
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,082
Sleep over it.

432
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:34,415
"We Shall Overcome, we shall overcome."

433
00:29:34,498 --> 00:29:38,498
"We shall overcome someday."

434
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:41,665
"Oh, deep in my heart."

435
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:44,165
"I do believe."

436
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:48,373
"We shall overcome someday."

437
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:50,665
Well done!

438
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,165
Well done, kids.

439
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:54,790
In this year's Annual Day,

440
00:29:55,165 --> 00:30:00,415
we will have an inter-school
fancy-dress competition.

441
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:04,082
Kabir, you should dress up
as Ravana (villain in the 'Ramayan').

442
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:05,335
Why Ravana?

443
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,707
Because your dad doesn't
believe in Shree Ram...

444
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,832
maybe you belong to Ravana's family!

445
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,790
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

446
00:30:17,207 --> 00:30:18,498
Give it. Quick!

447
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,457
What are you doing?

448
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,207
Who are you?

449
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:38,380
Hello...

450
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:41,498
Yes, this is Kabir's father.

451
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:44,582
What!?

452
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,790
It was shocking,
the way Kabir beat up this little boy.

453
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:52,498
Where did he learn
this violent behavior?

454
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:53,832
I don't know, ma'am...

455
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:56,790
Ours is a peace-loving family.

456
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:00,082
But it's not right to
call someone Ravana either.

457
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:01,752
I'm sure you understand.

458
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:03,165
It's verbal bullying.

459
00:31:03,373 --> 00:31:04,873
My Chintu is not a bully.

460
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,623
Kids playfully tease each other...

461
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:08,752
that doesn't mean your
son has the right to beat him up.

462
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:10,998
What Kabir did was
in the heat of the moment,

463
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:12,912
otherwise we are
from a cultured family.

464
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:15,040
Cultured family my foot!

465
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,415
Anyone who doesn't believe
in Shree Ram deserves to be insulted!

466
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,543
Don't get personal.

467
00:31:19,623 --> 00:31:20,665
Don't get personal now!

468
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:21,790
Wasn't beating up my son,
a personal matter?

469
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:23,082
Does that mean you'll swear at us?

470
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:25,127
-You think you'll get away with this?
-How dare you!

471
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:25,915
-Ma'am...
-Cool down!

472
00:31:25,998 --> 00:31:27,790
-Do you know what--
-Cool down, I said!

473
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:30,942
Mr. Kulshreshtha,
consider this a last warning.

474
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,790
This school will not
tolerate any kind of violence.

475
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:35,415
Do you understand?

476
00:31:38,207 --> 00:31:39,373
You may go now.

477
00:31:42,114 --> 00:31:44,123
Dad got scolded because of me.

478
00:31:44,995 --> 00:31:46,082
It's okay.

479
00:31:46,207 --> 00:31:48,082
You reacted because you were angry.

480
00:31:48,665 --> 00:31:50,540
But next time no fighting, Kabir.

481
00:31:50,748 --> 00:31:52,040
He insulted us.

482
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:54,123
Why does everyone hate Dad?

483
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,957
Cultured family, my foot!

484
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:21,185
Anyone who doesn't believe
in Shree Ram deserves to be insulted!

485
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:25,623
Your very name is a controversy now.

486
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:27,498
You may stay away from it

487
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:30,165
but the controversy
will not stay away from you.

488
00:32:40,457 --> 00:32:41,397
Thank you.

489
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:46,957
Is Kabir asleep?

490
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:48,415
Yes.

491
00:32:49,938 --> 00:32:53,207
He felt terrible about the
Principal scolding you because of him.

492
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:55,332
That's okay.

493
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,165
But what he was told...

494
00:32:57,941 --> 00:32:59,373
that is more worrying.

495
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,373
I have to clear my name, Gayatri.

496
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,957
Are you thinking of
going back to that mess?

497
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:12,915
No.

498
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:16,373
I am talking about how
I can get out of the mess.

499
00:33:16,582 --> 00:33:19,415
That man didn't just
insult me today...

500
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,998
he judged my family as well.

501
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:23,873
And for what?

502
00:33:24,094 --> 00:33:25,873
Just because I was suspended for...

503
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:28,165
blasphemy, that's all?

504
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,040
I'm a scientist,

505
00:33:38,165 --> 00:33:39,498
I will protect my family

506
00:33:39,623 --> 00:33:41,332
-with hard evidence, with truth--
-Enough of this, Aryan...

507
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:43,748
-with facts and--
-What are you even saying, Aryan?

508
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:47,373
What you're planning to do
will put the family into danger.

509
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,832
What do you want...

510
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:52,165
people to throw stones at our house?

511
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,498
For them to make our lives miserable?

512
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,457
Gayatri, I'd told you

513
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:00,832
this is a scientific expedition

514
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:02,998
which will bring out the truth.

515
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:07,498
The truth will shake the
foundation of an age-old belief.

516
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,873
Indrakant is a nice man.

517
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,332
He is sending me fully
equipped to Ram Setu.

518
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:16,415
And I would request you
please don't stress me out.

519
00:34:21,748 --> 00:34:22,290
Fine.

520
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:23,138
Thank you.

521
00:34:24,082 --> 00:34:27,415
I too will go 'fully equipped'
to my parents' house in Varanasi.

522
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,915
Go ahead and complete
your agenda for the government.

523
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,880
Gayatri...

524
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,752
Be assured that whatever you asked for

525
00:35:08,832 --> 00:35:10,998
has been provided on
the ship and much more...

526
00:35:11,123 --> 00:35:11,960
Best of luck!

527
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,623
Thank you very much.

528
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:15,998
-Dr. Aryan?
-Yes.

529
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:42,790
Approaching Ram Setu.

530
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,623
Please wear your seatbelt.

531
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:25,707
In this area, the weather
is very unpredictable.

532
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,540
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Bali.

533
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,707
Project manager.

534
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,373
-Pleasure meeting you.
-Likewise.

535
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:13,040
Come.

536
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:44,650
Come.

537
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:05,978
Mr. Indrakant was hell-bent...

538
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:09,437
no matter what,
every facility should be provided here.

539
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,062
I'll introduce you to everyone...

540
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,478
we have experts from
all over the world here.

541
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:15,103
Ladies and gentleman,

542
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:17,478
I present to you

543
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,020
Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha.

544
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:20,035
Hi.

545
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:24,145
Dr. Chandra, specializes
in under-water research.

546
00:38:24,645 --> 00:38:27,895
Dr. Gabrielle, geologist from Brazil...

547
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:31,895
world's leading expert in carbon-dating
using the AMS technique.

548
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:42,728
No way, I can't believe
that this ship has

549
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:46,020
a dedicated AMS machine
for carbon-dating.

550
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:48,645
Well, we spared no expense.

551
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:50,478
For this mission

552
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:53,187
we have all the
state-of-the-art technologies.

553
00:38:54,137 --> 00:38:57,145
Professor Andrew,
head of Remote Sensing.

554
00:38:57,687 --> 00:39:00,687
He will help you capture
sonar images of the Ram Setu.

555
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:03,103
Udyan and his team...

556
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:04,937
they are our scuba divers.

557
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,603
Hi.

558
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:08,687
Dr. Sandra Rebello,

559
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,312
environmental scientist from Goa.

560
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:14,187
Along with religious fanatics,

561
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,603
some environmentalists
are also against this project.

562
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,728
Mr. Indrakant is covering all the bases.

563
00:39:18,812 --> 00:39:19,687
Okay.

564
00:39:19,895 --> 00:39:21,562
Dr. Sandra Rebello will prove that

565
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:24,687
the Sethusamudram Project
will not harm nature.

566
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,327
Right?

567
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:27,952
Right.

568
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,160
That's really impressive.

569
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,452
Nice meeting all of you.

570
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:35,327
But, Mr. Bali...

571
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,327
I'd requested for another
member for the team.

572
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:39,619
I know.

573
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:41,577
I was keeping it for the last.

574
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:44,119
Udyan...

575
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:34,869
Meet Makar... your exosuit.

576
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:36,785
Your personal submarine...

577
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:40,244
That you can wear and remain under
the deep sea for hours.

578
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,035
This has inbuilt oxygen
and air pressure maintenance.

579
00:40:44,327 --> 00:40:46,744
There is no danger
of decompression sickness.

580
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:50,077
You'll be flying underwater,
just like Ironman.

581
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,327
Let's go for a dip tomorrow morning.

582
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,577
As you wish.

583
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:57,910
But I have one request...

584
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,619
we are very close to Sri Lankan waters

585
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:04,452
a civil war is going on
between the government and rebels.

586
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:07,619
Conduct your research
in the Indian territory.

587
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:09,119
Please.

588
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,285
Sure.

589
00:41:11,577 --> 00:41:18,577
We have taken sonar
pictures of the Ram Setu

590
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,702
...to create this 3-D image

591
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:22,619
which has never been done before.

592
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:26,535
As you can see, the bridge
which is submerged under the sea

593
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,869
is a 35km long stretch,

594
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,202
connecting Pamban Island of Tamil Nadu

595
00:41:31,327 --> 00:41:33,910
to Mannar Island of Sri Lanka.

596
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,744
At some points it reaches 3.5km in width

597
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,619
and up to 10m in depth.

598
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:41,494
Thank you, professor.

599
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:45,660
Dr. Chandra, what's your opinion on

600
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:48,369
why the Ram Setu is
submerged under the sea.

601
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:51,827
Well, because of global warming,

602
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,327
the sea level rises a little every year.

603
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:57,910
Right now, Ram Setu is
about 6-feet under sea level.

604
00:41:58,244 --> 00:42:01,369
That means, this structure
is thousands of years old.

605
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:04,952
But we can determine
its actual age after

606
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:07,994
testing samples of the bridge.

607
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:13,577
'Dating the Era of Lord Ram'
by Pushkar Bhatnagar...

608
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:16,827
this book, on the
basis of archeo-astronomy,

609
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,535
gives us the exact dates
of the incidents of the 'Ramayan'.

610
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,910
Sage Valmiki has described
star and planetary positions

611
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:25,869
in various places, in the 'Ramayan'.

612
00:42:25,952 --> 00:42:29,744
These positions don't get
repeated for thousands of years.

613
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,202
Pushkar Bhatnagar studied
these very planetary positions to

614
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:35,869
deduce when Shree Ram was born...

615
00:42:35,952 --> 00:42:39,660
which is roughly seven
thousand years ago.

616
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:46,410
To be precise, Shree Ram was born
on 10th January, 5114 BC...

617
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,869
We have to prove,

618
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:51,744
Ram Setu is more than
seven thousand years old

619
00:42:55,077 --> 00:42:56,869
...it predates Lord Ram.

620
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,035
Exactly!

621
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,744
Now let's find some evidence.

622
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:03,660
Sigma to Base.

623
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:04,660
It's a GO for descent.

624
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:05,625
Copy that.

625
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:29,660
All set?

626
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:31,302
Yeah.

627
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,494
Aryan, you must retrace your steps
on your way back

628
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:53,577
else your cable might get entangled.

629
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:54,785
Copy that.

630
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:04,577
Approaching Ram Setu.

631
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,744
Oh my God!

632
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,369
Guys, can you see this?

633
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,410
It looks like an engineering marvel.

634
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:22,035
I'm climbing down
into the base of the structure.

635
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:21,827
Okay, Aryan, turn right.

636
00:48:27,327 --> 00:48:28,952
Yeah, right there!

637
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:30,827
I need samples of these corals

638
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,077
to test for transplantation
possibilities.

639
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,014
Copy that.

640
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,494
Aryan, Gabrielle has
finished carbon dating

641
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,619
the sediment samples that you brought.

642
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,452
We have found some
fossils in the samples,

643
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:18,785
which are about 18 thousand years old.

644
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:20,577
18 thousand years!

645
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:24,952
This means, Ram Setu is much
older than seven thousand years.

646
00:49:27,619 --> 00:49:29,369
The bridge is older than Shree Ram.

647
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:30,785
This is a good piece of evidence

648
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:33,369
but it's not enough
to substantiate our claim.

649
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,494
We need more proof.

650
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:37,910
We need to find out
the age of the stones that

651
00:49:37,994 --> 00:49:40,244
form the main structure of Ram Setu.

652
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,619
We have already studied the sediment...

653
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:45,660
why do we need to find these stones?

654
00:49:47,244 --> 00:49:48,660
They're of the same age, aren't they?

655
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:49,869
Not necessarily.

656
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:53,035
This sediment is like
cement plastered on a wall.

657
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:55,577
We will have to study
the bricks as well.

658
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,869
The bricks of the Ram Setu are...

659
00:49:58,285 --> 00:49:59,660
floating rocks.

660
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:02,285
The floating rocks.

661
00:50:02,952 --> 00:50:06,077
In order to reach those rocks,
we will have to break the structure.

662
00:50:06,494 --> 00:50:07,619
Which is...

663
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:08,910
impossible.

664
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:24,410
According to this sonar image,

665
00:50:24,494 --> 00:50:26,119
here... near the Gulf of Mannar,

666
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:29,535
the upper portion of
the Ram Setu looks weak.

667
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:33,077
There might be loose rocks in this area.

668
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,327
That is a possibility.

669
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,410
Aryan, this area is very
close to the Lankan waters

670
00:50:39,994 --> 00:50:41,327
...our boundary.

671
00:50:42,827 --> 00:50:44,202
Bali, I'll be careful.

672
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:45,410
I promise.

673
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,827
Alpha to Base.

674
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,619
Divers are saying, the rocks
are not coming out of Ram Setu.

675
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,244
I repeat. The rocks are not coming out.

676
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:49,577
Don't go there, Aryan.

677
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:51,952
Those are Lankan waters.
Remain in our zone.

678
00:51:52,244 --> 00:51:54,160
I spot a floating rock, Bali.

679
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:55,535
One rock is all I need.

680
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:56,952
It won't take more than a few minutes.

681
00:51:57,077 --> 00:51:58,785
Aryan, do as you're told.

682
00:51:59,744 --> 00:52:01,327
Aryan, follow the rules!

683
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,285
Aryan, do you copy?

684
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:05,369
Aryan!

685
00:52:24,952 --> 00:52:25,785
No...

686
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,077
No!

687
00:52:28,952 --> 00:52:30,327
No...

688
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:47,452
He ejected from the exosuit.

689
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:48,994
Where the hell is Aryan?

690
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,869
Where has he disappeared, goddammit!

691
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,244
Is that him?

692
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,077
Where?

693
00:52:55,369 --> 00:52:56,369
There!

694
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:52,077
How is he walking
in middle of the sea?

695
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:53,619
He is walking on Ram Setu.

696
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:56,077
The water there is
less than six-inches deep.

697
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:28,910
Could be a pumice stone.

698
00:54:30,327 --> 00:54:31,494
I don't think so.

699
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:34,077
Pumice stone is made of lava

700
00:54:34,827 --> 00:54:37,077
and there has been no
volcanic activity in this area

701
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,827
in thousands of years.

702
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:41,952
This is something else.

703
00:54:43,785 --> 00:54:46,452
I had told you not
to enter Lankan waters.

704
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:51,827
According to the 'Ramayan',

705
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,535
Ram Setu was made
with such floating rocks.

706
00:54:54,619 --> 00:54:57,160
In order to disprove this theory,

707
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,619
it's vital to study these rocks.

708
00:55:02,994 --> 00:55:05,202
Gabrielle,
let's study the rock in the lab.

709
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,744
Chandra was right.

710
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,410
This is not a pumice stone.

711
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:08,702
Then what is it?

712
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:10,744
Not something I've seen before.

713
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,035
Aryan...

714
00:56:13,494 --> 00:56:14,952
the coral samples we've got

715
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,285
have evidence of loose
marine sand at the base.

716
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,910
This is not possible.

717
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,702
It seems, these corals
have been planted here.

718
00:56:21,869 --> 00:56:23,535
What do you mean they are planted?

719
00:56:23,785 --> 00:56:26,410
Are you saying they have been
brought from somewhere else?

720
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:27,744
Yeah.

721
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:31,577
Is it possible that they
floated here because of the tide?

722
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,785
No, there is no chance of that.

723
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,077
They have been deposited
in a linear manner...

724
00:56:37,202 --> 00:56:39,119
smaller corals on larger corals.

725
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,535
There's a really,
really clear pattern here.

726
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,869
I'm sure someone has brought
them here deliberately.

727
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:50,994
To put it better, these corals
have been planted in a straight line

728
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:52,619
to build Ram Setu.

729
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,494
They seem to be part
of the bridge's structure.

730
00:57:10,952 --> 00:57:12,119
Holy shitz!

731
00:57:12,744 --> 00:57:14,119
This is not possible.

732
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:17,369
What happened?

733
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,119
The organic remains in this rock

734
00:57:20,244 --> 00:57:22,452
are roughly seven thousand years old...

735
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,660
much younger than any fossils
found in the marine sediment.

736
00:57:26,494 --> 00:57:27,619
That proves...

737
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:35,202
If the organic remains found in
this rock are seven thousand years old,

738
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,244
this rock was brought
here around that time.

739
00:57:40,452 --> 00:57:41,785
And, Sandra...

740
00:57:42,577 --> 00:57:47,452
your research shows, the corals
were brought here from somewhere else.

741
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:49,994
Then...?

742
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,452
Then...

743
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:55,744
This could mean that
the Ram Setu structure

744
00:57:55,827 --> 00:57:58,660
is actually seven thousand years old

745
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:01,827
...and man-made!

746
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,494
Seven thousand years would mean...

747
00:58:08,827 --> 00:58:10,077
Period of Shree Ram!

748
00:58:21,827 --> 00:58:25,744
So now you want to prove that
Ram Setu was indeed built by Shree Ram!

749
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,119
My job is to unveil history.

750
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:31,702
Do you understand what 'history' means?

751
00:58:31,952 --> 00:58:33,577
'It thus happened!'

752
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,535
The truth will come to light.

753
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:40,035
Good evening, team.

754
00:58:41,244 --> 00:58:43,577
I received your message, Aryan.

755
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,827
So do you think this
is a man-made structure?

756
00:58:49,286 --> 00:58:51,286
Well, sir this is what
the evidence proves...

757
00:58:51,577 --> 00:58:53,869
Sandra and Gabrielle
also agree with me.

758
00:58:53,952 --> 00:58:55,744
What do you think, Dr. Chandra?

759
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,911
Well... I still believe

760
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,869
Ram Setu is a natural structure.

761
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:02,369
Okay.

762
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:06,661
Aryan, continue your research
with Sandra and Gabrielle.

763
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,786
Dr. Chandra,
continue working on your theory.

764
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:12,414
Thank you, sir.

765
00:59:12,494 --> 00:59:14,786
No... I must thank you, Aryan.

766
00:59:15,036 --> 00:59:17,994
Your impartiality is commendable.

767
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:22,411
I suggest, to dispel all doubt

768
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:25,244
break a section of
the structure of Ram Setu

769
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:27,702
and collect rock samples.

770
00:59:28,494 --> 00:59:30,911
This rock was found floating nearby.

771
00:59:31,286 --> 00:59:33,536
We need clinching proof.

772
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:34,494
I agree, sir

773
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:37,119
but breaking a part of the
Ram Setu might invite controversy.

774
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:38,411
Not in Sri Lanka.

775
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:41,327
You can do whatever you want
with the portion of the bridge

776
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,369
that is situated in Sri Lanka.

777
00:59:43,702 --> 00:59:46,827
I'll speak to the Lankan
government and make arrangements.

778
00:59:47,161 --> 00:59:49,411
But you'll have to
do this work at night

779
00:59:49,869 --> 00:59:52,119
so that not too many people find out.

780
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:54,202
I suggest, you do it tonight.

781
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:56,327
Sir, there's a civil
war going on there.

782
00:59:56,536 --> 00:59:57,619
Relax, Bali.

783
00:59:58,036 --> 00:59:59,494
I know what I'm doing.

784
01:00:01,077 --> 01:00:02,994
Give Aryan full assistance.

785
01:00:03,911 --> 01:00:04,994
Right, sir.

786
01:00:05,411 --> 01:00:07,327
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

787
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,702
Bali, there's a storm
warning at 2100 IST.

788
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:35,869
Have you made the required
adjustments in the submarine?

789
01:00:36,827 --> 01:00:38,994
I've conducted the safety
checks as per your brief.

790
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:40,202
Good.

791
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:46,911
Aryan, you'll enter
Lankan waters in 15 minutes.

792
01:00:47,286 --> 01:00:49,577
Remember to go as deep as possible.

793
01:00:49,702 --> 01:00:50,786
Copy that.

794
01:00:51,202 --> 01:00:53,369
Sandra, I don't trust him.

795
01:00:55,036 --> 01:00:57,369
Yeah, he doesn't seem very
happy with the development.

796
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,619
That's why I kept the
floating rock in my bag.

797
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:11,119
What?!

798
01:01:11,786 --> 01:01:13,536
What are you two whispering?

799
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:17,661
Gabrielle is carrying
the floating rock in her bag!

800
01:01:18,244 --> 01:01:19,119
What?!

801
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,536
Descending 50-feet.

802
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:30,869
100-feet.

803
01:01:39,202 --> 01:01:41,161
150-feet.

804
01:01:50,077 --> 01:01:51,494
200-feet.

805
01:01:57,911 --> 01:02:00,119
Descending 300-feet.

806
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:20,119
We've entered Sri Lankan waters.

807
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:23,202
This is it.

808
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,327
This is the Gulf of Mannar.

809
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:26,077
We should drill into this portion.

810
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:51,036
What's happening?

811
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:52,994
It's a storm.

812
01:02:54,577 --> 01:02:56,327
But why is the engine overheating?

813
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:15,244
I've lost control over the submarine.

814
01:03:33,202 --> 01:03:35,036
Submarine has completely shut down.

815
01:03:37,577 --> 01:03:38,994
Oxygen levels?

816
01:03:40,994 --> 01:03:41,994
Depleting fast...

817
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:42,956
Good.

818
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:44,702
Soon they won't be able to breathe.

819
01:03:44,994 --> 01:03:47,161
Didn't they know about this storm?

820
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:49,161
This was such a bad plan!

821
01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:55,036
Actually it is a bloody good plan!

822
01:03:56,286 --> 01:03:58,577
They've sent us to
die on this mission.

823
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:00,244
What about the emergency blow?

824
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,536
Even if they bring the
submarine to the surface,

825
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,202
it'll be impossible for
them to swim in this storm.

826
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:06,619
Bali...

827
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:08,119
The floating rock is missing!

828
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,744
What do you mean it's missing?

829
01:04:09,827 --> 01:04:11,619
I think Gabrielle took it with her.

830
01:04:15,577 --> 01:04:17,827
The engine has shut.
The oxygen level is low.

831
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:20,202
There's a storm in the
sea and we have no life jackets.

832
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:22,119
Oh my God!

833
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:25,327
Gabrielle... take shallow breaths.

834
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:27,327
We need to conserve oxygen.

835
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:29,786
When I said I don't trust Bali,
I didn't mean this!

836
01:04:30,577 --> 01:04:32,119
This is a planned murder.

837
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:33,994
We have to reach the surface.

838
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:37,327
I'm applying the emergency blow now.

839
01:04:37,494 --> 01:04:39,911
It's the only thing that'll
work without the engine.

840
01:04:40,161 --> 01:04:41,619
I'd suggest, brace yourself.

841
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:42,327
Okay.

842
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,369
Brace yourself.

843
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:27,494
Give me your hand, Gabrielle!
Come on.

844
01:05:27,577 --> 01:05:29,077
There's a storm up there.

845
01:05:41,994 --> 01:05:43,661
Hold on to it tightly.

846
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:51,827
Where is she?

847
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:53,827
Where is she?

848
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:55,244
Gabrielle...

849
01:06:02,744 --> 01:06:04,036
-Gabrielle...
-Are you okay?

850
01:06:05,077 --> 01:06:06,161
I can't swim.

851
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:12,119
Gabrielle, hold the floating rock.

852
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:13,494
Hold the floating rock.

853
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:14,827
Hold it properly.

854
01:06:15,077 --> 01:06:15,994
Don't leave it.

855
01:06:18,827 --> 01:06:19,619
Aryan!

856
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:23,161
Help!

857
01:06:25,827 --> 01:06:26,702
Help!

858
01:06:26,827 --> 01:06:27,952
Help!

859
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:30,327
Help!

860
01:06:30,994 --> 01:06:31,994
Help!

861
01:06:54,202 --> 01:06:56,619
Hand...
Hold my hand!

862
01:07:02,869 --> 01:07:04,202
Oh my god.
Thank god!

863
01:07:04,994 --> 01:07:07,161
Aryan, careful!

864
01:07:17,327 --> 01:07:19,077
Welcome to Sri Lanka.

865
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:21,286
Myself Anjaneya Pushpakumaran.

866
01:07:21,411 --> 01:07:23,036
You can call me AP.

867
01:07:23,702 --> 01:07:24,619
Let's go!

868
01:07:51,827 --> 01:07:53,869
You can't study the
Ram Setu like this.

869
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:55,369
AP will help you.

870
01:07:55,702 --> 01:07:57,619
AP knows Ram Setu like
the back of his hand.

871
01:07:58,036 --> 01:07:58,994
How?

872
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:00,994
I used to be a tourist guide.

873
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,827
After civil war broke out,

874
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,536
I earn a living by fishing.

875
01:08:05,036 --> 01:08:07,202
Please... tell us what you know.

876
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:08,827
Okay.

877
01:08:10,161 --> 01:08:12,077
Ram Setu used to be a proper bridge...

878
01:08:12,202 --> 01:08:14,911
there was an earthquake 700 years ago

879
01:08:14,994 --> 01:08:16,119
and the bridge broke.

880
01:08:16,661 --> 01:08:18,202
Do you have any evidence?

881
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:19,619
You want evidence?

882
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:21,369
In the 'Mahabharata',
Ghatotkach crossed this bridge

883
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:22,956
to meet his Lankan family.

884
01:08:23,036 --> 01:08:25,494
1000 years ago,
the Persian writer Alberuni

885
01:08:25,577 --> 01:08:27,994
wrote about this bridge
in his book 'Kitab ul Hind'.

886
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:30,244
I'm talking about scientific records.

887
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:31,994
You want scientific records?

888
01:08:32,077 --> 01:08:32,911
Yes.

889
01:08:33,786 --> 01:08:36,661
According to 'Ramayan' the bridge
dimention ratio is 100:10.

890
01:08:36,786 --> 01:08:40,869
Ram Setu is 35km
long and 3.5km wide...

891
01:08:40,952 --> 01:08:42,077
what is the ratio?

892
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,202
Same.

893
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:44,869
100:10

894
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:46,536
Scientific record!

895
01:08:46,994 --> 01:08:50,327
I know...
but this isn't enough to prove it.

896
01:08:59,744 --> 01:09:02,786
AP can take you to the middle
of Ram Setu and get you a rock.

897
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:05,911
A floating rock,
5-times the size of this one!

898
01:09:06,244 --> 01:09:07,369
Still find it funny?

899
01:09:09,702 --> 01:09:11,702
Be nice...
AP has access.

900
01:09:12,036 --> 01:09:14,994
Go there in the morning and
take as many rocks as you wish.

901
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:16,161
-Really?
-Yeah.

902
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:19,702
Mr. AP, why do you want to help us?

903
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,744
What will you gain out of this?

904
01:09:21,933 --> 01:09:22,956
Good question.

905
01:09:23,036 --> 01:09:25,577
I'm a guide...
your journey is my gain.

906
01:09:26,202 --> 01:09:30,202
All that I do to help you,
I'll write in this diary.

907
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:33,994
You can settle the account
after the journey ends.

908
01:09:34,661 --> 01:09:35,494
Okay.

909
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:39,911
How much are you charging
us for saving our lives?

910
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,161
That is complimentary.

911
01:09:44,286 --> 01:09:46,536
AP got clients because he saved you.

912
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,077
Aryan, why do you want
to go back to Ram Setu?

913
01:09:53,786 --> 01:09:55,494
Those people want us dead.

914
01:09:55,577 --> 01:09:57,869
We already have one rock.
It's enough as evidence.

915
01:09:57,952 --> 01:09:59,536
Let's just fly back to Delhi.

916
01:10:01,786 --> 01:10:03,869
We can't go back
after coming this far.

917
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:07,411
I want to study the core of Ram Setu.

918
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:09,077
I'd say...

919
01:10:10,994 --> 01:10:12,786
let's just give it one more day.

920
01:10:13,411 --> 01:10:14,411
Okay?

921
01:10:15,827 --> 01:10:16,786
Thank you.

922
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:50,036
They were able to get out of this

923
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:52,536
but they wouldn't have
survived last night's storm.

924
01:10:52,661 --> 01:10:54,077
Can't take a chance.

925
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:55,994
They have a sample of the rock.

926
01:10:56,536 --> 01:10:58,494
There are many small islands here...

927
01:10:58,994 --> 01:11:00,327
we must take a look.

928
01:11:00,494 --> 01:11:01,994
-Come on, let's go.
-Yes, sir.

929
01:11:03,994 --> 01:11:07,702
The Sri Lankan navy might
be present near the Ram Setu.

930
01:11:08,744 --> 01:11:11,536
Is it safe to go to
the Sri Lankan coast now?

931
01:11:12,202 --> 01:11:13,702
We don't have our passports.

932
01:11:13,827 --> 01:11:15,744
I'm more worried about dying.

933
01:11:16,286 --> 01:11:17,911
You don't need a passport for that!

934
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:21,369
-AP...
-Yes?

935
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:24,077
Did you get this scar
during the civil war?

936
01:11:24,202 --> 01:11:26,827
No, this is AP's childhood memory.

937
01:11:26,994 --> 01:11:28,369
When I was a child,

938
01:11:28,536 --> 01:11:30,036
I wanted to fly like a bird.

939
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,577
One day, I stretched out my
hands and jumped out of the window.

940
01:11:34,786 --> 01:11:36,994
But no flying... crash landing!

941
01:11:38,036 --> 01:11:39,036
Seven stitches.

942
01:11:43,994 --> 01:11:45,077
-AP...
-Yes?

943
01:11:45,327 --> 01:11:47,077
Turn the boat around. Bali!

944
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:47,994
Turn the boat around!

945
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,411
-But why?
-Oh my God!

946
01:11:51,744 --> 01:11:53,619
Make a U-turn, AP.

947
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:54,456
Why a U-turn?

948
01:11:54,536 --> 01:11:56,536
-Come on.
-This is my area... I'll negotiate...

949
01:11:56,786 --> 01:11:57,702
Hold this.

950
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:01,702
Take the boat over there.

951
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:03,572
AP...

952
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:04,702
Hello...

953
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:08,702
These are my tourists.

954
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:10,202
Don't come here. Go!

955
01:12:13,702 --> 01:12:14,994
U-turn! U-turn!

956
01:12:17,369 --> 01:12:18,494
Faster!

957
01:12:23,994 --> 01:12:25,036
Faster!

958
01:12:25,994 --> 01:12:28,077
Aryan, please. Faster!

959
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:42,286
Faster...
Faster!

960
01:12:42,536 --> 01:12:46,244
AP call friends.
Go to island fast.

961
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:47,911
Okay.

962
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,827
Faster.
Faster, please...

963
01:13:06,036 --> 01:13:07,202
Come on, everybody.

964
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:09,036
Let's go!

965
01:13:10,661 --> 01:13:11,952
Come on, Gabrielle

966
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:15,911
Aryan, wait.

967
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:23,869
Run fast.

968
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:24,994
Come on, everybody.

969
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:39,161
Come on.

970
01:14:01,577 --> 01:14:03,077
Both of you go to the helicopter.
I'll get her.

971
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,994
-Okay. Come on.
-Gabrielle...

972
01:14:05,244 --> 01:14:06,244
Madam, get up.

973
01:14:06,324 --> 01:14:06,914
Bag!

974
01:14:06,994 --> 01:14:08,577
I'll get it. Don't worry.
Go...

975
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:27,577
Wait! Run!

976
01:14:27,744 --> 01:14:29,911
Take it lower, take it lower!
Come faster. Come faster.

977
01:14:29,994 --> 01:14:30,994
Run fast.

978
01:14:31,077 --> 01:14:33,327
Jump. Come on.

979
01:14:33,494 --> 01:14:34,286
Move!

980
01:14:39,494 --> 01:14:41,744
-Gabrielle!
-Come on.

981
01:14:42,161 --> 01:14:43,286
-Run!
-Come on.

982
01:14:43,411 --> 01:14:45,286
Come on, Gabrielle. Fast.

983
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:51,164
Come on, Gabrielle.

984
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:52,077
Get in.

985
01:14:52,202 --> 01:14:54,286
Where's AP?

986
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,161
Hold my hand!
Hold my hand!

987
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:01,702
Hold my hand!

988
01:15:01,827 --> 01:15:02,911
-AP.
-Move!

989
01:15:02,994 --> 01:15:03,911
Come on.

990
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:05,244
Jump.

991
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:06,165
AP.

992
01:15:07,869 --> 01:15:09,119
Are these your friends?

993
01:15:09,244 --> 01:15:11,036
They are rebels fighting
against the government.

994
01:15:11,161 --> 01:15:13,544
Throttle up! Faster, throttle up!

995
01:15:16,161 --> 01:15:17,411
Where's the rock?

996
01:15:17,577 --> 01:15:18,914
Let's save our lives first.

997
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:19,956
Throttle up, throttle up!

998
01:15:20,036 --> 01:15:22,119
Tell him to fly towards Ram Setu.

999
01:15:22,244 --> 01:15:22,952
Towards Ram Setu.

1000
01:15:23,036 --> 01:15:23,869
Are you mad?

1001
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:25,494
Forget the rock now!
I want to go back!

1002
01:15:25,574 --> 01:15:27,869
Nobody will trust us
if we don't have the evidence.

1003
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:30,119
I don't care.
I'm out of this!

1004
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:39,827
No!

1005
01:15:54,661 --> 01:15:56,744
Why do you want
to go back to Ram Setu?

1006
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:58,956
We already have one rock.
It's enough as evidence.

1007
01:15:59,036 --> 01:16:00,577
Let's just fly back to Delhi.

1008
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:52,075
The three of them were
just spotted in Jaffna.

1009
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,117
I've alerted the local authorities.

1010
01:16:54,617 --> 01:16:58,450
You have to tighten
the noose and finish them!

1011
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:01,200
But I want the rock before that.

1012
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,325
But, sir, it's very difficult
to get to that side.

1013
01:17:04,867 --> 01:17:06,867
None of the flights
are landing in Jaffna.

1014
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:07,950
Come on...

1015
01:17:08,075 --> 01:17:09,575
Your flight will land in Jaffna

1016
01:17:09,783 --> 01:17:11,867
but give me some time
to pull a few strings.

1017
01:17:11,992 --> 01:17:15,200
In the meantime, ask Dr.Chandra
to complete his final report.

1018
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:17,408
So that we can submit
in the Supreme Court.

1019
01:17:17,575 --> 01:17:18,575
Immediately!

1020
01:17:18,783 --> 01:17:19,575
Copy that.

1021
01:17:52,783 --> 01:17:53,742
I'll just come.

1022
01:17:57,783 --> 01:17:58,283
What do you want?

1023
01:17:58,367 --> 01:18:00,200
Do you have a sat phone?

1024
01:18:00,283 --> 01:18:01,617
-Will try.
-Can you arrange?

1025
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,992
Mr. Aryan...

1026
01:18:28,825 --> 01:18:29,867
don't feel sad.

1027
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:31,867
AP has arranged a
satellite phone for you.

1028
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:33,658
Speak to your family.

1029
01:18:37,908 --> 01:18:38,783
Privacy?

1030
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,158
Okay...

1031
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:46,867
Sethusamudram Project
has a glimmer of hope.

1032
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:52,408
According to the new report submitted by
the government in the Supreme Court...

1033
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,908
Ram Setu was built much earlier
than the period of Ramayan.

1034
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,902
Please sir tell us...

1035
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:00,658
It is a big day today...

1036
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:04,242
Being a responsible government,

1037
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:07,908
we formed a team of
scientists from all over the world.

1038
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:13,117
They studied the fossils that were
found in Ram Setu and found out that

1039
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:17,075
the bridge which is a natural formation,

1040
01:19:17,402 --> 01:19:20,158
is about 18 thousand years old.

1041
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:22,075
This proves that

1042
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:27,992
Shree Ram did not build this bridge.

1043
01:19:28,367 --> 01:19:30,075
After the submission of this report,

1044
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:34,742
Court has given the opposition
three days to file their reply.

1045
01:19:34,992 --> 01:19:38,767
If they are unable
to file a suitable reply,

1046
01:19:39,033 --> 01:19:42,200
a part of Ram Setu's structure
will be demolished.

1047
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,117
-Gunnu!
-Yes?

1048
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,117
Come here, quick.

1049
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,617
Pushpak Shipping Company has...

1050
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:47,533
Be right there.

1051
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,200
What happened?

1052
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,033
Namaste, Mr. Chaddha.

1053
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:54,158
Namaste, Gayatri.

1054
01:19:54,325 --> 01:19:56,075
There's a phone call for you.

1055
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,575
-At your house?
-Yes.

1056
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,742
Gayatri...

1057
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:01,662
Aryan?

1058
01:20:01,742 --> 01:20:03,033
Why are you calling me here?

1059
01:20:03,158 --> 01:20:04,575
Your phone might be tapped.

1060
01:20:05,325 --> 01:20:06,200
Forget that.

1061
01:20:06,408 --> 01:20:07,258
I'm sorry.

1062
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:10,033
You've completed the mission, isn't it?

1063
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:12,200
You must be happy.

1064
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,120
What do you mean
completed the mission'?

1065
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,575
It was being shown on TV...

1066
01:20:15,783 --> 01:20:18,242
The government has submitted
a scientific report in Court...

1067
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:20,825
stating that the Ram Setu
is eighteen thousand years old...

1068
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:23,117
demolition of Ram Setu
starts in three days.

1069
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:25,492
I'm sure you must've made this report.

1070
01:20:25,783 --> 01:20:27,242
No!
Not at all!

1071
01:20:27,742 --> 01:20:30,408
Indrakant has used Chandra's report.

1072
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,325
He tried to silence us
as well but we managed to escape.

1073
01:20:34,825 --> 01:20:35,575
What--

1074
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:40,158
Tried to silence you? Escaped?

1075
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,700
Tell me everything that happened.
Aryan, where are you?

1076
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,492
Somewhere in Sri Lanka.

1077
01:20:46,742 --> 01:20:48,120
What are you doing in Sri Lanka?

1078
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,950
It's a long story, I'll tell you later.

1079
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:51,867
Weren't you supposed to be at Ram Setu?

1080
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:53,200
Yes I was...

1081
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,200
but now Indrakant wants me dead.

1082
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,158
What?!

1083
01:20:56,242 --> 01:20:58,120
That's why it's difficult
for me to go there.

1084
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,783
I've even lost the rock from Ram Setu.

1085
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,200
I will have to search
for another rock...

1086
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,120
Because that rock is the only evidence

1087
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,075
to prove that Ram Setu was man-made.

1088
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:09,867
What are you even saying, Aryan?

1089
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:11,992
You cannot risk your
life for another rock!

1090
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,117
Leave everything
and come home right now.

1091
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:15,992
Enough of your obsession with Ram Setu!

1092
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:18,492
But, Gayatri it's
not just about Ram Setu.

1093
01:21:18,575 --> 01:21:21,700
If I find any solid
evidence about Shree Ram,

1094
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:25,325
I'll be able to prove that
'Ramayan' is not just an epic

1095
01:21:25,492 --> 01:21:27,120
but our history as well.

1096
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,825
What evidence are you talking about?

1097
01:21:28,992 --> 01:21:31,700
We are one of the oldest
civilizations in the world.

1098
01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:34,408
It's impossible to find
archeological evidence.

1099
01:21:34,783 --> 01:21:36,033
This is a lost cause.

1100
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:37,200
Just come back, please.

1101
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:41,283
What's that noise?

1102
01:21:41,992 --> 01:21:42,908
Hello?

1103
01:21:43,158 --> 01:21:43,987
Hello...

1104
01:21:44,242 --> 01:21:45,117
Aryan?

1105
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:46,492
Hello, Aryan...

1106
01:21:47,492 --> 01:21:48,575
Hello, can you hear me?

1107
01:21:49,283 --> 01:21:50,742
Aryan, are you okay?

1108
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:52,283
Hello...

1109
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:07,314
Hello...

1110
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:08,575
Hold on, professor.

1111
01:22:12,283 --> 01:22:15,867
A large part of Ramayan
took place in Lanka...

1112
01:22:15,992 --> 01:22:18,492
Yes, but you'll only
find evidence of Ravana there...

1113
01:22:18,575 --> 01:22:20,033
-not Shree Ram.
-Exactly.

1114
01:22:20,252 --> 01:22:23,117
If I can prove that Ravana existed...

1115
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:26,242
it will automatically
prove the existence of Shree Ram!

1116
01:22:26,325 --> 01:22:29,617
Not much research has been done
on the Ramayan, in Sri Lanka.

1117
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,033
I'm sure there are high
chances of finding evidence here.

1118
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:33,158
Makes sense.

1119
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,492
But Jaffna is in middle of a civil war.

1120
01:22:37,825 --> 01:22:39,242
Please be careful.

1121
01:22:39,742 --> 01:22:41,117
I'm worried about you.

1122
01:22:41,742 --> 01:22:42,908
Don't worry...

1123
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,283
your Lord Hanuman will protect me.

1124
01:22:46,825 --> 01:22:47,908
I'm sorry again.

1125
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,075
Take care.

1126
01:22:58,867 --> 01:23:02,700
Sandra, if we find the archaeological
remains of Ravana's Lanka here...

1127
01:23:02,783 --> 01:23:06,408
no one will be able to
question Ramayan and Ram Setu.

1128
01:23:08,325 --> 01:23:09,950
Where do we start?

1129
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,325
Will the government of
Sri Lanka support us?

1130
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:14,742
Why not?
AP has friends.

1131
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,158
Do you have friends in both camps?

1132
01:23:19,073 --> 01:23:20,200
In the civil war...

1133
01:23:20,325 --> 01:23:21,742
they're all our people.

1134
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:23,492
That's why AP is a friend to all.

1135
01:23:23,575 --> 01:23:25,575
You're also my friends...
and AP is ready to help.

1136
01:23:25,658 --> 01:23:28,575
But you need to pay
me a little extra for this.

1137
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,325
Of course.

1138
01:23:30,492 --> 01:23:35,120
Tell me... if we're looking for
Ravana's Lanka in present day Sri Lanka,

1139
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,033
where can we find clues?

1140
01:23:43,033 --> 01:23:49,075
I've heard, Jaffna Public Library has
maps and drawings made on palm leaves

1141
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:51,492
...documentation of thousands
of years of history.

1142
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:55,242
You'll surely find
clues about Ravana in them.

1143
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,742
You would know something...

1144
01:24:09,033 --> 01:24:11,117
Give me some idea please.

1145
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:13,908
Feeling jealous?

1146
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:16,658
No way!

1147
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:19,200
He's not even my type.

1148
01:24:20,033 --> 01:24:22,283
And this library is also not my type.

1149
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,492
Forget about thousand-year
old manuscripts,

1150
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:27,117
these books aren't even 50-years old!

1151
01:24:42,075 --> 01:24:43,158
What's wrong?

1152
01:24:53,992 --> 01:24:55,908
Thank you.
Bye.

1153
01:24:56,033 --> 01:24:57,158
Let's go!

1154
01:24:57,317 --> 01:24:59,242
We have to leave immediately.
Forget the book.

1155
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:00,283
Why forgetting?

1156
01:25:00,533 --> 01:25:02,325
The palm leaf book has been found.

1157
01:25:03,157 --> 01:25:04,200
Which section?

1158
01:25:04,575 --> 01:25:06,908
It's not in this library.
I'll tell you about it outside.

1159
01:25:10,117 --> 01:25:13,033
The library was set
on fire in the 1981 riots.

1160
01:25:13,299 --> 01:25:15,575
Many of the historical
documents were burnt but

1161
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:18,783
an old librarian managed
to save some manuscripts.

1162
01:25:18,908 --> 01:25:21,158
He will meet us now
and show us the book.

1163
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:24,075
Why didn't he return those
documents to the library?

1164
01:25:24,492 --> 01:25:25,867
There's a civil war going on!

1165
01:25:25,992 --> 01:25:28,120
That book is priceless,
it can't be risked again.

1166
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,158
I see.

1167
01:25:29,492 --> 01:25:31,200
Did that girl tell you all this?

1168
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:33,242
Yes, turns out she's from my village.

1169
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:34,408
Very nice lady.

1170
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:36,200
Where will we find the librarian?

1171
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,367
-Both of you are on the 'wanted' list...
-Yes.

1172
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:44,200
we'll have to meet him in secret.

1173
01:25:44,452 --> 01:25:46,742
I'll set up the meeting.
Both of you go to the hotel...

1174
01:25:47,371 --> 01:25:49,408
keep this phone with you
and wait for my message.

1175
01:26:00,075 --> 01:26:01,075

1176
01:26:02,075 --> 01:26:04,200
There There There...
Look there Look there!

1177
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:06,158
Let's go. This side.

1178
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:15,658
Move.

1179
01:26:16,825 --> 01:26:18,283
Let's go. Fast!

1180
01:26:25,158 --> 01:26:26,617
Hey! Grab him!

1181
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,075
Fast.

1182
01:26:31,908 --> 01:26:33,492
-Why you running like this?!
-Sorry...

1183
01:26:41,825 --> 01:26:42,908
Go...

1184
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,200
Who's that?!

1185
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:45,783
Come on.

1186

Oh no!

1188

Hold my hand.

1189
01:27:02,825 --> 01:27:03,867
What would we do?

1190
01:27:03,992 --> 01:27:04,825
No!

1191
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,408
Come, let's go.

1192
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,039
Fast.

1193
01:27:30,033 --> 01:27:30,840
Jump.

1194
01:27:33,825 --> 01:27:34,992

[JAFFNA FORT 7 P.M.]

1202
01:28:55,283 --> 01:28:57,908
This man is no ordinary librarian.

1203
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,575
Seven generations of his family have
been protecting this secret manuscript.

1204
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:03,783
He likes your cause

1205
01:29:03,992 --> 01:29:06,033
...this is why he's
showing this book to you.

1206
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:28,533
This manuscript is
at least 400-years old.

1207
01:29:29,367 --> 01:29:32,200
But he said these records
are thousands of years old.

1208
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:34,158
The records are thousands of years old

1209
01:29:34,325 --> 01:29:38,408
but the manuscript needs
to be changed every 400-500 years.

1210
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,117
See this... these are palm leaves.

1211
01:29:43,283 --> 01:29:45,325
They have to be changed
because they get decayed.

1212
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:50,117
Found anything?

1213
01:29:50,367 --> 01:29:52,492
There's a design of a secret tunnel...

1214
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,908
probably made by Mayasur.

1215
01:29:55,908 --> 01:29:57,075
Who's Mayasur?

1216
01:29:57,242 --> 01:30:01,992
Mayasur was Ravana's father-in-law
who had built Lanka.

1217
01:30:02,117 --> 01:30:04,867
I think he was the one
who built this maze of tunnels.

1218
01:30:05,075 --> 01:30:06,162
They've drawn the secret tunnel

1219
01:30:06,242 --> 01:30:08,825
which is spread across
hundreds of kilometers.

1227

Golden Lanka was built
in a triangular shape.

1228
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:43,200
Triangular shapes were used
extensively in ancient civilizations.

1229

From Egyptian pyramids
to Greek architecture...

1230

and our own temples.

1231
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,200
It's everywhere.

1232
01:30:51,242 --> 01:30:53,992
Okay. But how will we reach this tunnel?

1233
01:30:54,575 --> 01:30:56,617

closest among these...

1234
01:30:56,825 --> 01:30:58,492
we can enter the secret
tunnel from there.

01:32:03,575 --> 01:32:04,992
If Ravana's tunnel
was indeed situated here,

1246
01:32:05,075 --> 01:32:06,162
everyone would've known about it

1247
01:32:06,242 --> 01:32:07,283
because it's a tourist spot.

1248
01:32:07,408 --> 01:32:09,158
No point in going there.

1249
01:32:09,499 --> 01:32:11,533
They might demolish Ram Setu
in a couple of days.

1250
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:14,492
We need to find the secret tunnel soon.

1251
01:32:14,783 --> 01:32:17,950
Doesn't the map have any clues about
where the tunnel opens?

1252
01:32:22,867 --> 01:32:25,492
Looks like the face
of an animal or a demon.

1253
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:27,200
Show me!

1254
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:32,825
This reminds me of Mutalai.

1255
01:32:33,325 --> 01:32:34,325
Mutalai?

1256
01:32:35,158 --> 01:32:36,658
A relative of yours?

1257
01:32:37,408 --> 01:32:38,908
Very funny...

1258
01:32:39,117 --> 01:32:41,200
Mutalai means 'crocodile'.
Crocodile.

1259
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:45,575
Oh yes.

1260
01:32:45,992 --> 01:32:47,742
This looks like a crocodile.

1261
01:32:48,492 --> 01:32:51,120
AP, are there crocodiles in this area?

1262
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,742
Sri Lanka has a plenty of them
but not sure about this area.

1263
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:57,533
Is there any lake or
river in this area?

1264
01:33:01,033 --> 01:33:03,242
There is a waterfall... Ravana Ella.

1265
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:06,117
According to folklore,
Ravana used to sit there and play veena.

1266
01:33:08,075 --> 01:33:09,492
Let's go there then.

1267
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:13,075
This tunnel is definitely
near a water body.

1268
01:33:13,867 --> 01:33:14,664
Sure.

1269
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:16,742
We'll rent a car from the station.

1270
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:20,242
Sleep...

1271
01:33:28,242 --> 01:33:32,450
Sir, that librarian sent
those three to meet this old man.

1272
01:33:32,533 --> 01:33:34,033
They were looking for this map.

1273
01:33:34,117 --> 01:33:36,408
Ask him where are they first headed to?

1274
01:33:36,783 --> 01:33:37,412
Hey!

1275
01:33:37,492 --> 01:33:39,075
Where didt hey go first?!

1276
01:33:39,367 --> 01:33:40,533
Ashok Vatika.

1277
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:44,908
Nuwara Eliya.

1278
01:33:44,992 --> 01:33:46,992
They've left a few hours ago.

1279
01:33:47,075 --> 01:33:48,325
Once Aryan enters the tunnel,

1280
01:33:48,408 --> 01:33:50,158
it'll be difficult to find him.

1281
01:33:50,575 --> 01:33:53,367
Ask Silva to take out the bird.
Let's search the region of Ashok Vatika.

1282
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:54,700
-Copy.
-Leave book!

1283
01:33:54,783 --> 01:33:55,617
Move!

1284
01:34:10,527 --> 01:34:11,861
How much farther will you make us walk?

1285
01:34:12,027 --> 01:34:14,361
You'd said you'd rent
a car from the station.

1286
01:34:14,486 --> 01:34:16,027
If you change plans last minute,

1287
01:34:16,111 --> 01:34:17,736
how will we get a car?

1288
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,361
We have to take lift now.

1289
01:34:19,527 --> 01:34:21,069
-Stop.
-Stop.

1290
01:34:22,652 --> 01:34:23,444
Stop.

1291
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:34,087
[Speaking in tamil]

1292
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:37,666
[Speaking in tamil]

1293
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:43,377
[Speaking in tamil]

1294
01:34:43,687 --> 01:34:48,931
[Speaking in tamil]

1295
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:54,684
[Speaking in tamil]

1296
01:34:55,978 --> 01:35:00,421
[Speaking in tamil]

1297
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:01,327
He's coming.

1298
01:35:04,963 --> 01:35:05,685
What did he say?

1299
01:35:05,765 --> 01:35:06,852
They're returning from a wedding.

1300
01:35:06,932 --> 01:35:09,045
The groom wants you to sing a song.

1301
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,270
I can't.

1302
01:35:10,645 --> 01:35:11,871
I don't know how to sing.

1303
01:35:11,951 --> 01:35:14,321
You're an Indian, aren't you?

1304
01:35:14,401 --> 01:35:15,137
Yes.

1305
01:35:15,217 --> 01:35:16,679
Sing a Bollywood song.

1306
01:35:17,179 --> 01:35:18,313
My wife wants...

1307
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:20,255
Any song will do.

1308
01:35:20,335 --> 01:35:21,056
What do you mean?

1309
01:35:21,136 --> 01:35:23,397
I'm an archeologist,
not an 'Indian Idol' contestant.

1310
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:24,594
Why don't you sing.

1311
01:35:24,674 --> 01:35:25,801
I can't sing.

1312
01:35:25,957 --> 01:35:26,849
You sing?

1313
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:28,089
I know only Tamil songs.

1314
01:35:28,169 --> 01:35:29,363
He wants to hear a Bollywood song

1315
01:35:29,443 --> 01:35:31,003
they might throw us out of the bus

1316
01:35:31,223 --> 01:35:31,956
your wish.

1317
01:35:32,036 --> 01:35:34,639
Come on.
I can't sing, no way...

1318
01:35:35,737 --> 01:35:37,221
Try. Try.

1319
01:35:37,813 --> 01:35:39,964
Sing the song or we throw you out!

1320
01:35:40,397 --> 01:35:41,297
Try!

1321
01:36:22,436 --> 01:36:24,950
"It's time for celebration"

1322
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:27,351
"For the wedding party"

1323
01:36:27,518 --> 01:36:29,919
"The groom and bride are right here"

1324
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:32,569
"And they are holding hands"

1325
01:36:32,744 --> 01:36:35,303
"A 'filmy' song is playing"

1326
01:36:35,383 --> 01:36:37,753
"And I'm making up the lyrics"

1327
01:36:37,913 --> 01:36:40,671
"Mr. Groom, why don't you tell me"

1328
01:36:40,751 --> 01:36:42,897
"Who I should get to the dance floor"

1329
01:36:42,977 --> 01:36:45,556
"I'm celebrating the
wedding of someone unknown"

1330
01:36:45,636 --> 01:36:48,148
"But I'll make sure everyone has fun"

1331
01:36:48,523 --> 01:36:50,364
"Welcome, welcome"

1332
01:36:50,444 --> 01:36:53,240
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1333
01:36:53,448 --> 01:36:55,499
"Welcome, welcome"

1334
01:36:55,579 --> 01:36:58,533
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1335
01:36:58,766 --> 01:37:00,755
"Welcome, welcome"

1336
01:37:00,835 --> 01:37:03,683
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1337
01:37:03,955 --> 01:37:05,912
"Welcome, welcome"

1338
01:37:05,992 --> 01:37:09,112
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1339
01:37:45,247 --> 01:37:46,486
"Romance is but a gamble"

1340
01:37:46,566 --> 01:37:47,801
"And love is a game"

1341
01:37:47,881 --> 01:37:50,408
"In which we think of
only one person day and night"

1342

01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:53,002
"And enjoy yourselves"

1344
01:37:53,082 --> 01:37:55,584
"As you play the lovers' game"

1345
01:37:55,664 --> 01:37:56,933
"I know for sure"

"Whether it's Delhi or down South"

1347
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:00,760
"Everyone gets drunk at weddings"

1348
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,067
"If it's true love"

1349
01:38:02,147 --> 01:38:03,397
"And you're sure about your feelings"

1350
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:05,532
"That, my friends, is priceless"

1351
01:38:06,207 --> 01:38:08,741
"It's a beautiful day"

1352
01:38:08,821 --> 01:38:11,128
"With dreams abounding"

1353
01:38:11,378 --> 01:38:13,757
"The henna on the bride's hands"

01:38:16,336 --> 01:38:18,947
"Color yourself with the color of love"

1356
01:38:19,027 --> 01:38:21,740
"Enjoy and live the
life that you wish to"

01:38:29,068 --> 01:38:31,877
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1361
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:34,151
"Welcome, welcome"

1362
01:38:34,231 --> 01:38:37,273
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1363
01:38:37,353 --> 01:38:39,262
"Welcome, welcome"

1364
01:38:39,342 --> 01:38:41,987
"What a fun! What a fun!"

1365
01:39:49,386 --> 01:39:50,014
There!

1366
01:39:50,094 --> 01:39:50,902
See that...

1367
01:39:51,094 --> 01:39:52,386
something is moving in the water.

1368
01:39:54,761 --> 01:39:56,344
That's a dwarf crocodile.

1369
01:39:56,678 --> 01:39:58,178
It could be a cave crocodile...

1370
01:39:58,511 --> 01:40:02,136
small crocodiles like these, that
live in caves, are also found in Africa.

1371
01:40:02,636 --> 01:40:03,678
-AP...
-Yes?

1372
01:40:03,996 --> 01:40:05,553
-Can you follow that crocodile please?
-Sure.

1373
01:40:48,761 --> 01:40:50,303
The lake ends here.

1374
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:52,178
What do we do now?

1375
01:40:53,428 --> 01:40:56,761
Where did the small
crocodile we were chasing go?

1376
01:40:57,678 --> 01:40:59,344
The crocodile led us here.

1377
01:40:59,757 --> 01:41:02,386
Is the tunnel inside this rock?

1378
01:41:03,011 --> 01:41:04,719
There is no opening...

1379
01:41:05,386 --> 01:41:07,303
How could this be a tunnel?

1380
01:41:08,178 --> 01:41:10,261
This crocodile chase was a stupid idea.

1381
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:13,553
Maybe we should've gone
to Ashok Vatika.

1382
01:41:32,761 --> 01:41:35,261
I think we're at the correct location.

1383
01:41:37,094 --> 01:41:38,178
Guys, come here.

1384
01:41:38,303 --> 01:41:39,386
AP, come here.

1385
01:41:42,178 --> 01:41:45,219
See the reflection
of this rock on the water.

1386
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:50,636
Rock?

1387
01:41:53,678 --> 01:41:54,678
Crocodile!

1388
01:41:55,761 --> 01:41:58,928
Crocodile on the map
is an inverted image of this rock.

1389
01:42:00,136 --> 01:42:01,219
Right!

1390
01:42:01,511 --> 01:42:03,386
The tunnel could be under water...

1391
01:42:07,887 --> 01:42:08,681
Let's go.

1392
01:42:08,761 --> 01:42:09,928
Where?

1393
01:42:10,178 --> 01:42:11,428
Under water?

1394
01:42:11,844 --> 01:42:13,094
This lake is very dangerous.

1395
01:42:13,219 --> 01:42:14,594
AP won't go into 'crocodile water'.

1396
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,053
-Come on, AP...
-It's a small crocodile.

1397
01:42:17,136 --> 01:42:17,844
No, sir.

1398
01:42:17,924 --> 01:42:19,761
Come on, AP...
You're not coming?

1399
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:20,794
No, sir.

1400
01:42:20,874 --> 01:42:21,761
-Sure?
-Sure.

1401
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:24,428
Fine. Forget about your fees.

1402
01:42:24,969 --> 01:42:25,761
Let's go...

1403
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:27,719
How can I forget about it?

1404
01:42:27,803 --> 01:42:29,386
I've kept an account of everything.
AP is coming...

1405
01:42:29,469 --> 01:42:31,011
-Double charge for this!
-AP!

1406
01:43:02,886 --> 01:43:03,761
Aryan.

1407
01:43:06,386 --> 01:43:07,344
Aryan...

1408
01:43:08,219 --> 01:43:09,553
Aryan!

1409
01:43:10,094 --> 01:43:11,386
What the hell!

1410
01:43:11,842 --> 01:43:13,094
Aryan!

1411
01:43:13,803 --> 01:43:15,178
Stop shouting.

1412
01:43:15,719 --> 01:43:16,719
Oh my God...

1413
01:43:24,678 --> 01:43:26,386
We are inside the rock now...

1414
01:43:27,261 --> 01:43:28,594
This is the tunnel.

1415
01:43:28,761 --> 01:43:29,594
Come on.

1416
01:43:30,094 --> 01:43:30,969
Let's move.

1417
01:43:35,594 --> 01:43:37,928
Thank god these bags are waterproof.

1418
01:43:43,844 --> 01:43:45,136
What are you doing, AP?

1419
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:46,844
There could be wild animals inside...

1420
01:43:46,928 --> 01:43:48,386
I'm making a torch.

1421
01:43:57,011 --> 01:43:58,761
Sir, I've reached Ashok Vatika.

1422
01:43:59,261 --> 01:44:00,761
They haven't come here.

1423
01:44:01,178 --> 01:44:02,594
A man matching Aryan's description

1424
01:44:02,678 --> 01:44:04,761
was spotted near the waterfall,
a few hours ago.

1425
01:44:04,928 --> 01:44:06,761
No trace of them after that.

1426
01:44:07,928 --> 01:44:09,678
I think they've found the tunnel.

1427
01:44:09,761 --> 01:44:12,972
The court's deadline will soon end.

1428
01:44:14,261 --> 01:44:16,678
We have to remain careful till...

1429
01:44:17,428 --> 01:44:21,761
the start of bridge's demolition.

1430
01:44:22,428 --> 01:44:25,219
Do you have a map of the tunnel?

1431
01:44:25,386 --> 01:44:26,219
Yes, sir.

1432
01:44:26,469 --> 01:44:29,761
Reach the spot where the tunnel opens.

1433
01:44:32,261 --> 01:44:35,428
And wait for that bloody
rat to come out of the hole!

1434
01:44:36,094 --> 01:44:38,594
Sir, there are a dozen
places the tunnel opens at...

1435
01:44:38,969 --> 01:44:41,761
I think Aryan will emerge
from either of these two places...

1436
01:44:42,428 --> 01:44:44,969
Sri Pada, on Adam's Peak mountain or...

1437
01:44:45,053 --> 01:44:47,969
Wariyapola,
also known as Ravana's airport.

1438
01:44:48,178 --> 01:44:50,553
No... we cannot second-guess this.

1439
01:44:50,969 --> 01:44:54,011
We have to get an expert
to study this map...

1440
01:44:54,594 --> 01:44:56,761
someone who thinks like Aryan.

1441
01:44:57,219 --> 01:44:58,094
Okay, sir.

1442
01:44:58,219 --> 01:44:59,553
I know just the person.

1443
01:45:28,511 --> 01:45:30,261
-Aryan!
-Po!

1444
01:45:30,761 --> 01:45:32,178
What "Po"?

1445
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:37,303
What "Po"?

1446
01:45:37,844 --> 01:45:38,931
Bloody bats!

1447
01:45:39,011 --> 01:45:39,844
Okay sir?

1448
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,178
Which way now?

1449
01:45:52,844 --> 01:45:54,386
Take a look at the map and tell me.

1450
01:45:57,928 --> 01:45:59,553
This intersection
isn't there in the map.

1451
01:45:59,636 --> 01:46:00,511
What?!

1452
01:46:01,761 --> 01:46:04,136
One, two, three...

1453
01:46:04,219 --> 01:46:05,636
What are you doing?

1454
01:46:05,803 --> 01:46:07,928
Hello...
what are you doing?

1455
01:46:08,094 --> 01:46:09,761
One should count when confused.

1456
01:46:09,928 --> 01:46:12,178
We should go in the
direction the count ends.

1457
01:46:12,344 --> 01:46:13,344
Any problem?

1458
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:15,469
Go ahead.

1459
01:46:16,594 --> 01:46:17,761
I forgot because of you...

1460
01:46:18,011 --> 01:46:22,136
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven..

1461
01:46:22,428 --> 01:46:24,761
Nine,... ten!

1462
01:46:33,261 --> 01:46:34,303
Aryan...

1463
01:46:48,386 --> 01:46:49,553
Give me the torch.

1464
01:46:55,178 --> 01:46:56,469
What happened, Aryan?

1465
01:46:58,969 --> 01:46:59,995
Aryan?

1466
01:47:22,594 --> 01:47:23,553
Hela script!

1467
01:47:23,969 --> 01:47:25,178
What is Hela?

1468
01:47:28,178 --> 01:47:29,678
Aryan, what is Hela?

1469
01:47:29,761 --> 01:47:31,219
Ancient script of Lanka...

1470
01:47:31,303 --> 01:47:34,219
thousands of years old. Some
of its symbols have been deciphered.

1471
01:47:34,303 --> 01:47:35,261
AP...

1472
01:47:35,469 --> 01:47:36,511
AP...

1473
01:47:37,553 --> 01:47:38,681
Come here.

1474
01:47:38,761 --> 01:47:40,803
What happened?
All okay?

1475
01:47:41,969 --> 01:47:42,928
Look...

1476
01:47:45,844 --> 01:47:47,261
What's written here?

1477
01:47:48,761 --> 01:47:49,761
Ravalu...

1478
01:47:51,261 --> 01:47:52,761
could mean 'Ravana'...

1479
01:47:54,136 --> 01:47:56,803
Helatuva... island of Hela people...

1480
01:47:58,428 --> 01:48:02,344
The middle word looks like 'radhaya'

1481
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:05,761
...could mean

1482
01:48:07,428 --> 01:48:09,178
'Ravana, the King of island'.

1483
01:48:11,761 --> 01:48:14,303
Why are these inscriptions
written on the ceiling?

1484
01:48:20,303 --> 01:48:22,678
These might be secret
directions to the tunnel.

1485
01:48:22,758 --> 01:48:25,803
Why is the Hela script written
in a particular direction?

1486
01:48:28,428 --> 01:48:29,928
I think let's follow the script.

1487
01:48:30,219 --> 01:48:31,344
Come on, let's go.

1488
01:48:31,678 --> 01:48:32,678
Let's go.

1489
01:48:32,761 --> 01:48:34,011
I told you...

1490
01:48:34,553 --> 01:48:35,761
AP is always right.

1491
01:48:36,303 --> 01:48:38,803
Nine, ten, it stopped at this tunnel.

1492
01:48:39,761 --> 01:48:40,556
Didn't I tell you?

1493
01:48:40,636 --> 01:48:42,303
Yes, you did tell us.
Come on.

1494
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:47,337
The final hearing
on the Sethusamudram case

1495
01:48:47,421 --> 01:48:49,171
will take place in
Supreme Court tomorrow.

1496
01:48:49,251 --> 01:48:52,212
The government has asked
for Court's permission

1497
01:48:52,296 --> 01:48:54,296
to demolish Ram Setu.

1498
01:48:55,212 --> 01:48:59,004
As per the government, all
departments working on this project

1499
01:48:59,087 --> 01:49:00,796
are ready and waiting.

1500
01:49:00,921 --> 01:49:05,504
As this news broke, Pushpak Shipping
Corporation shares saw a rise.

1501
01:49:05,587 --> 01:49:11,462
I would like to remind you, after the
final hearing tomorrow afternoon...

1502
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:15,962
Supreme Court might give permission
for Ram Setu to be demolished.

1503
01:49:26,254 --> 01:49:27,837
This is incredible.

1504
01:49:28,254 --> 01:49:32,087
If I had time, I would've
decoded all these inscriptions now.

1505
01:49:35,504 --> 01:49:39,337
We'll now be able to prove
that this tunnel is man-made...

1506
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:41,046
built during Ravana's era.

1507
01:49:42,879 --> 01:49:45,421
We might even come
across Ravana's Lanka...

1508
01:49:45,629 --> 01:49:46,921
-Hey...
-Yes?

1509
01:49:47,671 --> 01:49:48,837
Look in front.

1510
01:50:10,379 --> 01:50:12,337
Ravana's palace!

1511
01:50:12,879 --> 01:50:14,504
Same to same triangle!

1512
01:50:15,421 --> 01:50:16,754
Golden Lanka!

1513
01:50:26,671 --> 01:50:29,254
According to the map,
there should be three pathways

1514
01:50:29,546 --> 01:50:31,087
but there are only two.

1515
01:50:31,171 --> 01:50:33,671
The right one leads to Wariyapola and

1516
01:50:33,754 --> 01:50:35,254
the left one to Sri Pada.

1517
01:50:36,629 --> 01:50:37,479
One minute...

1518
01:50:39,129 --> 01:50:40,337
Oh no,

1519
01:50:40,921 --> 01:50:43,129
the third pathway that
leads to Ravana's Lanka

1520
01:50:43,212 --> 01:50:44,629
is behind this wall.

1521
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:48,379
Looks like someone has
blocked it with this rock.

1522
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:55,879
AP...

1523
01:50:55,962 --> 01:50:56,796
Yes?

1524
01:50:58,254 --> 01:51:00,337
We'll have to break this rock...

1525
01:51:00,712 --> 01:51:03,171
Seems like all the walking
has turned your brain into mush.

1526
01:51:03,421 --> 01:51:05,712
We have only two options...
left or right.

1527
01:51:06,421 --> 01:51:08,212
AP feels we should go left.

1528
01:51:08,462 --> 01:51:10,171
Sri Pada religiously very important.

1529
01:51:10,337 --> 01:51:12,171
Let's go to Wariyapola.

1530
01:51:12,587 --> 01:51:14,337
If it's known as Ravana's airport...

1531
01:51:14,421 --> 01:51:16,879
there might be archaeological
remains over there.

1532
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:18,796
Wariyapola is a tourist spot...

1533
01:51:18,921 --> 01:51:20,421
We'll only find Japanese
and Chinese tourists there,

1534
01:51:20,546 --> 01:51:21,712
no archaeology.

1535
01:51:22,171 --> 01:51:23,254
Let's go to Sri Pada...

1536
01:51:23,379 --> 01:51:26,421
I promise we'll find
Ravana there... Shree Ram too.

1537
01:51:27,837 --> 01:51:29,921
People say Sri Pada
fulfills all prayers.

1538
01:51:30,046 --> 01:51:31,587
You should go there
and offer your prayers.

1539
01:51:31,712 --> 01:51:33,879
No, we don't have
time to offer prayers.

1540
01:51:35,004 --> 01:51:37,129
We need hard evidence.

1541
01:51:38,629 --> 01:51:39,546
Let's go to Wariyapola.

1542
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:40,254
Thank you.

1543
01:51:40,337 --> 01:51:42,712
Sri Pada is also known
as Trikut mountain in Lanka.

1544
01:51:44,962 --> 01:51:46,087
Trikut mountain?

1545
01:51:47,504 --> 01:51:49,754
Golden Lanka was visible
from Trikut mountain...

1546
01:51:52,629 --> 01:51:56,087
If Sri Pada is the Trikut
mountain mentioned in 'Ramayan',

1547
01:51:56,212 --> 01:52:00,171
we might find evidence
of Golden Lanka near it.

1548
01:52:04,587 --> 01:52:07,004
I think what he's saying is right.

1549
01:52:07,379 --> 01:52:09,004
Let's go... Come on. Well done!

1550
01:52:09,421 --> 01:52:10,212
Madam...

1551
01:52:32,337 --> 01:52:33,546
Sri Pada,

1552
01:52:34,171 --> 01:52:35,754
also known as Trikuta.

1553
01:53:12,587 --> 01:53:14,837
What... are you tired?

1554
01:53:17,337 --> 01:53:20,379
Ravana's Lanka was marked
with a triangle on the map.

1555
01:53:21,337 --> 01:53:24,421
The triangular shadow
of that mountain we see...

1556
01:53:25,546 --> 01:53:27,546
might be that very triangle.

1557
01:53:28,004 --> 01:53:32,004
Does that mean Ravana's
Lanka was situated there?

1558
01:53:34,879 --> 01:53:35,921
Eureka!

1559
01:53:37,671 --> 01:53:38,879
AP was right...

1560
01:53:39,462 --> 01:53:41,337
Sri Pada answers all prayers.

1561
01:53:54,879 --> 01:53:56,879
AP, if we find Ravana's Lanka...

1562
01:53:57,129 --> 01:54:00,212
this would be the fastest archaeological
expedition, thanks to you.

1563
01:54:00,462 --> 01:54:02,962
We'll surely find it.
AP is the best guide.

1564
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:13,337
Oh my god...

1565
01:54:14,046 --> 01:54:15,171
Sandra!

1566
01:54:15,421 --> 01:54:16,504
Sandra!

1567
01:54:27,337 --> 01:54:29,254
This is selaginella bryopteris.

1568
01:54:29,796 --> 01:54:33,087
These plants are found only
in northern India, not Sri Lanka.

1569
01:54:34,504 --> 01:54:39,379
This is believed to be what was called
'Sanjeevani Booti' in the 'Ramayan'.

1570
01:54:39,587 --> 01:54:40,629
No way.

1571
01:54:40,879 --> 01:54:41,921
Right...

1572
01:54:42,296 --> 01:54:44,462
this is the first time
AP saw this plant in Lanka.

1573
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:48,254
I'm sure this is 'Sanjeevani'.

1574
01:54:49,837 --> 01:54:50,962
If this is 'Sanjeevani'...

1575
01:54:51,046 --> 01:54:53,379
we're standing in
Ravana's Lanka right now.

1576
01:55:19,046 --> 01:55:20,087
Gayatri?

1577
01:55:23,796 --> 01:55:24,962
Hello, folks.

1578
01:55:25,629 --> 01:55:26,796
Long time!

1579
01:55:37,712 --> 01:55:39,004
I have to say, Aryan...

1580
01:55:39,087 --> 01:55:41,462
along with being a
good professor of History,

1581
01:55:41,587 --> 01:55:43,712
your wife knows you very well.

1582
01:55:44,962 --> 01:55:46,254
I didn't want to help them...

1583
01:55:47,046 --> 01:55:48,296
but I got scared.

1584
01:55:51,421 --> 01:55:52,379
Sorry.

1585
01:55:55,421 --> 01:55:57,921
The description of Ravana's
Lanka in the manuscript

1586
01:55:58,004 --> 01:56:00,004
matches that in 'Valmiki Ramayan'.

1587
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:02,421
It is proof that Ravana existed...

1588
01:56:02,629 --> 01:56:04,087
it's a very big literary evidence.

1589
01:56:04,212 --> 01:56:05,254
When he showed it to me,

1590
01:56:05,379 --> 01:56:06,879
I knew you would reach here.

1591
01:56:07,421 --> 01:56:09,379
And you told him where to find us?

1592
01:56:10,212 --> 01:56:11,212
Yes.

1593
01:56:12,004 --> 01:56:12,879
Sorry.

1594
01:56:13,129 --> 01:56:16,879
Sorry but this evidence is with me now

1595
01:56:18,462 --> 01:56:21,129
and you'll also return
that floating rock to me.

1596
01:56:21,462 --> 01:56:23,421
We don't have the floating rock.

1597
01:56:23,796 --> 01:56:25,171
Don't play games!

1598
01:56:25,629 --> 01:56:26,837
There's a civil war going on here...

1599
01:56:26,921 --> 01:56:28,796
you might disappear without a trace!

1600
01:56:29,337 --> 01:56:31,421
We're not playing games.

1601
01:56:31,671 --> 01:56:35,129
We left the rock there when
we were escaping from that place.

1602
01:56:35,629 --> 01:56:37,212
Gabrielle lost the rock.

1603
01:56:37,462 --> 01:56:41,212
That's why we've come to Sri Lanka,
in search of evidence.

1604
01:56:41,462 --> 01:56:42,504
Isn't it?

1605
01:56:47,587 --> 01:56:48,671
Last chance.

1606
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:50,546
Where is the rock?

1607
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:51,421
Oh my god.

1608
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:52,421
Don't shoot.

1609
01:56:52,546 --> 01:56:53,712
-Listen to me...
-Move!

1610
01:56:53,879 --> 01:56:54,754
AP!

1611
01:57:00,212 --> 01:57:01,462
AP...

1612
01:57:17,587 --> 01:57:18,712
Are you okay?

1613
01:57:19,712 --> 01:57:20,546
No!

1614
01:57:21,421 --> 01:57:22,254
Stop!

1615
01:57:22,504 --> 01:57:23,796
Stop firing in the chopper.

1616
01:57:28,462 --> 01:57:30,087
Force the pilot to land.

1617
01:57:30,212 --> 01:57:31,087
Okay.

1618
01:57:31,629 --> 01:57:33,421
Land the chopper.

1619
01:57:33,504 --> 01:57:34,629
Land the chopper right now!

1620
01:57:44,754 --> 01:57:47,129
Land the chopper right now!

1621
01:57:49,837 --> 01:57:51,129
Give me that...

1622
01:57:52,921 --> 01:57:54,296
Gayatri, gun!

1623
01:57:56,462 --> 01:57:58,754
Gayatri, gun!

1624
01:58:02,171 --> 01:58:03,046
No...

1625
01:58:04,046 --> 01:58:05,504
Just stop...

1626
01:58:39,504 --> 01:58:40,796
We're going down!

1627
01:58:40,921 --> 01:58:42,379
Caution terrain!

1628
01:58:42,712 --> 01:58:44,046
We're going to crashland.

1629
01:58:44,421 --> 01:58:45,587
-Give me that.
-Stop!

1630
01:58:52,087 --> 01:58:56,421
Caution terrain!

1631
01:58:56,712 --> 01:59:00,671
Caution terrain!

1632
01:59:01,171 --> 01:59:02,754
Caution terrain!

1633
01:59:20,796 --> 01:59:23,046
Sit over there.

1634
01:59:26,962 --> 01:59:28,296
Are you okay?

1635
01:59:41,421 --> 01:59:42,712
Stop crying now.

1636
01:59:43,504 --> 01:59:45,587
AP died protecting me.

1637
01:59:46,962 --> 01:59:48,712
I tried to save him...

1638
01:59:52,462 --> 01:59:54,587
all I could save was his bag.

1639
02:00:02,712 --> 02:00:04,462
Why was his bag so heavy?

1640
02:00:10,837 --> 02:00:12,962
Aryan...
Where are you going?

1641
02:00:13,421 --> 02:00:14,837
Don't go there, Aryan!

1642
02:00:19,462 --> 02:00:20,546
Floating rock.

1643
02:00:28,046 --> 02:00:29,129
Help...

1644
02:00:35,587 --> 02:00:37,046
Aryan, come out right now!

1645
02:00:38,921 --> 02:00:39,879
Aryan!

1646
02:00:45,296 --> 02:00:46,254
Come fast.

1647
02:00:46,379 --> 02:00:47,546
-Aryan!
-Run!

1648
02:00:48,962 --> 02:00:50,712
Aryan, come on. Run.

1649
02:00:50,837 --> 02:00:52,962
-Aryan, come on.
-Run!

1650
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:54,212
Aryan!

1651
02:00:54,671 --> 02:00:56,796
-Aryan!
-Aryan, come on. Get out of there.

1652
02:01:16,629 --> 02:01:18,546
Are you okay?

1653
02:01:19,296 --> 02:01:20,421
Open the bag.

1654
02:01:22,421 --> 02:01:23,504
You okay?

1655
02:01:24,796 --> 02:01:25,879
The rock!

1656
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,796
Why didn't he tell us?

1657
02:01:29,546 --> 02:01:30,879
I don't know.

1658
02:01:32,296 --> 02:01:35,379
If we present this rock
and the manuscript to the world...

1659
02:01:36,087 --> 02:01:37,712
we might be able to
prove that Shree Ram existed

1660
02:01:37,796 --> 02:01:39,254
and that the story
of Ram Setu is true.

1661
02:01:39,379 --> 02:01:40,421
Wait...

1662
02:01:40,546 --> 02:01:42,587
He took a sample
of the Sanjeevani also.

1663
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:44,587
We have enough evidence now.

1664
02:01:44,921 --> 02:01:46,629
But we don't have much time...

1665
02:01:46,879 --> 02:01:49,296
the final hearing takes
place this afternoon.

1666
02:01:55,462 --> 02:01:56,837
How do we get out here?

1667
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,462
I can help.

1668
02:02:01,379 --> 02:02:02,629
I can help.

1669
02:02:08,712 --> 02:02:11,171
My Lord, Ram Setu Protection Committee

1670
02:02:11,254 --> 02:02:14,587
has not been able to
submit any hard evidence

1671
02:02:15,379 --> 02:02:19,546
to prove that Ram Setu
is a man-made structure

1672
02:02:19,837 --> 02:02:21,629
built by Shree Ram.

1673
02:02:22,171 --> 02:02:26,879
I would request the Court
to reject this case immediately

1674
02:02:26,962 --> 02:02:30,046
and not stop the
demolition of Ram Setu.

1675
02:02:30,462 --> 02:02:31,712
That's all, My Lord.

1676
02:02:31,962 --> 02:02:35,254
Mr. Jagannathan,
do you have any evidence?

1677
02:02:35,421 --> 02:02:39,212
My Lord, I want some more time...

1678
02:02:39,337 --> 02:02:40,379
My Lord...

1679
02:02:44,004 --> 02:02:45,504
I have many evidences.

1680
02:02:48,046 --> 02:02:49,462
Who are you, mister?

1681
02:03:03,421 --> 02:03:04,254
Aryan, My Lord.

1682
02:03:04,379 --> 02:03:07,337
Mr. Aryan, I'm sure you're aware that

1683
02:03:07,629 --> 02:03:10,546
you can be punished for
disturbing the court's proceedings.

1684
02:03:11,421 --> 02:03:12,049
I do.

1685
02:03:12,129 --> 02:03:14,254
You should have brought
your lawyer along.

1686
02:03:14,379 --> 02:03:15,921
If you don't have a lawyer,

1687
02:03:16,004 --> 02:03:18,212
the court would have
provided you with one.

1688
02:03:18,587 --> 02:03:21,921
I only want to tell you
that I'm an archaeologist

1689
02:03:22,421 --> 02:03:25,671
who understands the language of rocks,
bricks and lost civilizations.

1690
02:03:25,796 --> 02:03:30,837
My method and language may
be different from that of law but

1691
02:03:30,962 --> 02:03:34,129
My Lord, I believe that the truth...

1692
02:03:34,254 --> 02:03:37,421
in any language, any form...

1693
02:03:37,796 --> 02:03:39,379
will still be the truth.

1694
02:03:41,879 --> 02:03:43,087
He's the same archaeologist

1695
02:03:43,212 --> 02:03:45,212
who had submitted a report
on behalf of the government.

1696
02:03:48,462 --> 02:03:49,546
Mr. Aryan,

1697
02:03:50,296 --> 02:03:53,129
the Court permits you to speak.

1698
02:03:54,254 --> 02:03:56,587
But after hearing
what you have to say,

1699
02:03:56,879 --> 02:03:58,171
if we deem fit,

1700
02:03:58,379 --> 02:04:01,629
you can be punished for
wasting the Court's time.

1701
02:04:02,421 --> 02:04:03,337
Okay.

1702
02:04:34,962 --> 02:04:40,254
My Lord, I am an archaeologist
who believes in evidence.

1703
02:04:40,504 --> 02:04:41,629
Till a week ago,

1704
02:04:41,754 --> 02:04:45,837
I too didn't believe Ram Setu
is a man-made structure.

1705
02:04:46,796 --> 02:04:50,296
But I am forced to
change my opinion today.

1706
02:04:51,129 --> 02:04:56,212
Carbon dating shows that
the fossils found on this rock are

1707
02:04:56,337 --> 02:04:58,337
about seven thousand years old.

1708
02:04:58,421 --> 02:05:02,004
That means, Ram Setu is
seven thousand years old.

1709
02:05:02,754 --> 02:05:07,337
According to Pushkar Bhatnagar,
seven thousand years means...

1710
02:05:07,421 --> 02:05:08,837
Period of Shree Ram.

1711
02:05:13,129 --> 02:05:14,171
These corals...

1712
02:05:14,379 --> 02:05:17,796
have been brought from somewhere
else and planted around Ram Setu.

1713
02:05:18,379 --> 02:05:19,921
They are not native to this site.

1714
02:05:20,046 --> 02:05:22,796
The question is, who were these people

1715
02:05:23,129 --> 02:05:25,879
who placed these corals and rocks?

1716
02:05:26,129 --> 02:05:27,671
Under whose direction?

1717
02:05:27,796 --> 02:05:29,546
The answer is Shree Ram.

1718
02:05:29,671 --> 02:05:34,962
My Lord, Pushkar Bhatnagar's evidence
cannot be taken as final evidence.

1719
02:05:35,421 --> 02:05:40,337
If you insist, even if I do agree
with Shree Ram's date of birth...

1720
02:05:40,421 --> 02:05:42,629
how does it prove that

1721
02:05:42,754 --> 02:05:45,754
the person who built
Ram Setu was indeed Shree Ram?

1722
02:05:46,129 --> 02:05:47,921
I want to ask the government

1723
02:05:48,046 --> 02:05:49,879
who did the great poets,
right from the ancient poet Valmiki

1724
02:05:50,004 --> 02:05:51,712
to the great poet Tulsidas

1725
02:05:51,837 --> 02:05:54,796
say the Ram Setu was built by?

1726
02:05:56,171 --> 02:05:56,504
Ram.

1727
02:05:56,629 --> 02:05:57,921
Shree Ram!

1728
02:05:59,004 --> 02:06:00,212
Right from Valmiki...

1729
02:06:00,337 --> 02:06:04,921
generations of Indian
mothers and grandmothers

1730
02:06:05,046 --> 02:06:09,712
have taught their children
that Ram Setu was built by Shree Ram.

1731
02:06:10,837 --> 02:06:14,421
One understands why Shree Ram
is an integral part of India...

1732
02:06:14,504 --> 02:06:18,587
but why do Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia,

1733
02:06:18,712 --> 02:06:21,546
Thailand and Vietnam hold
Shree Ram in such high veneration

1734
02:06:21,671 --> 02:06:23,379
in their cultural consciousness?

1735
02:06:23,462 --> 02:06:27,129
Why is 'Ramayan' mentioned
in Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism?

1736
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:30,837
Why is Shree Ram mentioned numerous
times in the 'Guru Granth Sahib'?

1737
02:06:30,962 --> 02:06:31,504
Why?

1738
02:06:31,629 --> 02:06:32,587
My Lord,

1739
02:06:32,712 --> 02:06:37,004
just because a good story has been
repeated often does not mean it is true!

1740
02:06:37,421 --> 02:06:39,296
Over centuries, these stories

1741
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:44,629
have travelled with traders
and travellers in various countries.

1742
02:06:44,754 --> 02:06:46,212
What's new about it?

1743
02:06:46,337 --> 02:06:49,671
I would like to ask
the learned ASG madam,

1744
02:06:50,129 --> 02:06:54,421
all the places described
in 'Valmiki Ramayan'...

1745
02:06:54,546 --> 02:06:57,962
haven't they all been found
to exist in India and Sri Lanka?

1746
02:06:58,671 --> 02:07:03,296
Aren't there 500 such places in
India and 50 such places in Sri Lanka?

1747
02:07:03,421 --> 02:07:08,629
My Lord, no archaeological
evidence of Shree Ram and his story

1748
02:07:08,754 --> 02:07:11,462
has been found in any of these places.

1749
02:07:11,754 --> 02:07:14,587
In a world where dozens of
civilisations have come and gone,

1750
02:07:14,712 --> 02:07:17,087
where entire countries
have disappeared from the map,

1751
02:07:17,212 --> 02:07:20,296
where some cultures have completely
vanished in a matter of few decades,

1752
02:07:20,462 --> 02:07:23,921
how do you expect one to find archeological
evidence of a 7000 year old history?

1753
02:07:24,171 --> 02:07:27,421
Madam... is a difficult
and challenging task.

1754
02:07:28,546 --> 02:07:33,962
But my Lord, during my exploration
in Jaffna, I found a manuscript

1755
02:07:34,421 --> 02:07:38,879
with the map of Ravana's secret
tunnel that was built by Mayasur.

1756
02:07:40,504 --> 02:07:45,254
My friends and I found the
tunnel with the help of the map.

1757
02:07:45,379 --> 02:07:50,379
My Lord, the map on this manuscript
is seven thousand years old

1758
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:53,754
and so is the tunnel.

1759
02:07:54,379 --> 02:07:56,671
The inscriptions found in the tunnel

1760
02:07:56,921 --> 02:08:00,421
are in the ancient
Sri Lankan script of Hela.

1761
02:08:01,171 --> 02:08:02,337
My Lord,

1762
02:08:02,421 --> 02:08:06,171
in my opinion, this is the Trikut
mountain that is described in 'Ramayan'

1763
02:08:06,296 --> 02:08:09,421
...known as Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka.

1764
02:08:09,796 --> 02:08:14,171
Around this mountain,
we found a plant called...

1765
02:08:15,712 --> 02:08:17,421
Selaginella Bryopteris.

1766
02:08:17,629 --> 02:08:20,254
This is the closest candidate
to what was described

1767
02:08:20,379 --> 02:08:22,546
as Sanjeevani Booti in 'Ramayan'.

1768
02:08:23,462 --> 02:08:25,087
Lord Hanuman had taken

1769
02:08:25,212 --> 02:08:28,712
this plant there from India.
It is not native to Sri Lanka.

1770
02:08:28,921 --> 02:08:30,171
Question is,

1771
02:08:30,296 --> 02:08:33,629
why is this plant found
only around Trikut mountain?

1772
02:08:34,254 --> 02:08:37,421
My Lord, there is Lanka
mentioned in 'Ramayan',

1773
02:08:37,546 --> 02:08:39,212
Ravana existed in Lanka...

1774
02:08:39,337 --> 02:08:42,087
why can't we believe
Shree Ram existed in Ayodhya?

1775
02:08:42,212 --> 02:08:45,171
My Lord, what we call Ram Setu

1776
02:08:45,629 --> 02:08:50,212
is called Adam's Bridge by
followers of Christianity and Islam.

1777
02:08:50,504 --> 02:08:55,421
They believe Adam had crossed

1778
02:08:55,879 --> 02:08:58,796
this bridge to come
to India from Sri Lanka.

1779
02:08:59,421 --> 02:09:02,421
Tell me,
which story will you believe in?

1780
02:09:02,796 --> 02:09:09,337
My Lord, if Indian Christians and
Muslims believe this is Adam's Bridge...

1781
02:09:09,421 --> 02:09:13,171
is it not an additional
reason to save the bridge?

1782
02:09:13,296 --> 02:09:16,421
But they don't oppose the demolition
of this bridge, Your Honor.

1783
02:09:17,254 --> 02:09:22,171
Will madam ASG tell us who named
this bridge Adam's Bridge, and when?

1784
02:09:24,254 --> 02:09:26,587
No, I am not sure.

1785
02:09:26,712 --> 02:09:27,629
Let me tell you.

1786
02:09:27,754 --> 02:09:33,129
My Lord, 220 years ago, in 1788...

1787
02:09:33,209 --> 02:09:38,712
based on the findings of Australian
botanical explorer Joseph Park,

1788
02:09:38,837 --> 02:09:44,254
the first Surveyor of East India Company,
General James Rennel made a map...

1789
02:09:44,334 --> 02:09:47,837
known as the Map of Hindustan
or Map of the Mughal Empire.

1790
02:09:47,962 --> 02:09:51,754
This map is kept in Thanjavur's
Saraswati Mahal Library...

1791
02:09:51,879 --> 02:09:56,754
The bridge that connects India and Sri
Lanka is called Ram Setu in this map.

1792
02:09:57,129 --> 02:10:00,587
James Rennel changed
the name of the bridge

1793
02:10:00,712 --> 02:10:04,212
from Ram Setu to Adam's Bridge,
in the 1804 version of the map.

1794
02:10:04,421 --> 02:10:07,337
Ram Setu suddenly
became Adam's Bridge.

1795
02:10:07,546 --> 02:10:13,421
This was a ploy by the British
to make Indian history Eurocentric.

1796
02:10:13,921 --> 02:10:17,629
This was a conspiracy
to erase Shree Ram's history.

1797
02:10:20,379 --> 02:10:23,046
The argument on Ram Setu has
reached an interesting point in Court.

1798
02:10:23,212 --> 02:10:26,546
Dr. Aryan Kulshreshtha has provided
all evidence related to Ram Setu

1799
02:10:26,626 --> 02:10:27,671
and silenced everyone.

1800
02:10:27,999 --> 02:10:31,499
My Lord, the government is
working on this project keeping all

1801
02:10:31,582 --> 02:10:33,582
environmental concerns in mind.

1802
02:10:34,499 --> 02:10:37,749
A very small portion of
Ram Setu will be demolished.

1803
02:10:37,832 --> 02:10:41,749
As far as religious
sentiments are concerned...

1804
02:10:41,915 --> 02:10:46,165
are we not compromising
with progress of the nation

1805
02:10:46,749 --> 02:10:49,707
by considering religious sentiments
before every big decission.

1806
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:51,790
The Hindu community of our country

1807
02:10:51,874 --> 02:10:53,874
calls the soil Mother Earth...

1808
02:10:54,665 --> 02:10:56,790
considers Cow as their mother...

1809
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:58,665
Even river Ganges
is worshipped as mother.

1810
02:10:58,905 --> 02:11:01,915
Worships trees, stones and mountains.

1811
02:11:02,236 --> 02:11:06,624
Tomorrow if a group opposes the
construction of a dam on river Ganges

1812
02:11:06,707 --> 02:11:08,665
saying, we worship the river

1813
02:11:08,844 --> 02:11:12,350
or opposes an electric
pole on a mountain

1814
02:11:12,749 --> 02:11:14,749
because the mountain
is the abode of their Gods...

1815
02:11:15,055 --> 02:11:17,790
Don't cut down trees
as our Gods live on them...

1816
02:11:19,152 --> 02:11:24,290
Will science and progress ever manage
to find a foothold in our country?

1817
02:11:30,707 --> 02:11:32,249
That's all, My Lord.

1818
02:11:36,749 --> 02:11:37,790
Mr. Aryan...

1819
02:11:44,665 --> 02:11:50,665
My Lord, in order to save the symbol
of India's defeat, the Qutub Minar,

1820
02:11:51,332 --> 02:11:54,082
the route of Delhi's
metro rail was changed...

1821
02:11:54,415 --> 02:11:58,999
Because, though a symbol of defeat,
it is our historical monument...

1822
02:11:59,082 --> 02:12:00,540
our heritage.

1823
02:12:01,165 --> 02:12:05,415
The best example of
human craftsmanship...

1824
02:12:05,499 --> 02:12:09,874
called 'the symbol of love',
the unique Taj Mahal...

1825
02:12:09,957 --> 02:12:12,499
in order to save its
beauty from getting ruined,

1826
02:12:12,582 --> 02:12:14,707
Taj Corridor was stopped.

1827
02:12:15,207 --> 02:12:18,499
So that the white marble of
the Taj Mahal does not get discolored,

1828
02:12:18,582 --> 02:12:21,582
factories in its
vicinity were shut down.

1829
02:12:22,207 --> 02:12:25,749
My Lord, Taj Mahal is known
as the symbol of love across the world,

1830
02:12:25,832 --> 02:12:31,832
it is our responsibility to try
our best to save it from getting ruined.

1831
02:12:31,915 --> 02:12:36,832
But why is our government
so eager to demolish

1832
02:12:37,082 --> 02:12:39,332
the symbol of the oldest love story...

1833
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:42,040
Ram Setu... the symbol
of a woman's honor!

1834
02:12:42,332 --> 02:12:45,082
My Lord, I want to ask you...

1835
02:12:45,207 --> 02:12:50,332
why were the Lord Buddha statues
of Bamyan in Afghanistan bombed?

1836
02:12:51,415 --> 02:12:54,749
Were the Taliban looking for the
stones that the statues were made of...

1837
02:12:54,915 --> 02:12:56,832
to decorate their homes with?

1838
02:12:57,207 --> 02:12:58,332
The fact is,

1839
02:12:59,707 --> 02:13:03,207
the Taliban had a
problem with Lord Buddha.

1840
02:13:03,499 --> 02:13:06,749
As long as the statues
were standing there,

1841
02:13:06,874 --> 02:13:12,624
they couldn't deny the connection
between Lord Buddha and Afghanistan...

1842
02:13:13,124 --> 02:13:18,499
My Lord, why had the world raised their
voice against the Taliban at that time?

1843
02:13:19,124 --> 02:13:21,749
Because Lord Buddha now
belonged not just to India,

1844
02:13:21,874 --> 02:13:23,665
but also to the world.

1845
02:13:24,249 --> 02:13:27,374
Similarly, demolishing Ram Setu

1846
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:30,124
is an attempt to wipe
out the memories of Shree Ram.

1847
02:13:30,457 --> 02:13:34,999
As long as Ram Setu exists,
it will show the world...

1848
02:13:35,082 --> 02:13:38,040
whenever a woman is kidnapped...

1849
02:13:38,165 --> 02:13:39,624
whenever she is tortured...

1850
02:13:39,707 --> 02:13:45,624
Shree Ram will emerge to cross
the seas with his army of followers

1851
02:13:45,707 --> 02:13:47,707
and vanquish Ravana!

1852
02:13:49,082 --> 02:13:52,540
There are thousands of temples dedicated
to Shree Ram all over the world

1853
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:56,749
But there is only
one bridge... Ram Setu!

1854
02:13:57,249 --> 02:14:00,624
Only people who think
like the Taliban would think of

1855
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:02,749
demolishing this bridge!

1856
02:14:03,374 --> 02:14:06,749
My Lord, no archaeologist or scientist

1857
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,957
will oppose the Sethusamudram Project.

1858
02:14:10,874 --> 02:14:15,124
All we need to do is
find an alternative route.

1859
02:14:16,374 --> 02:14:21,124
If progress comes at the
cost of destroying our culture...

1860
02:14:21,207 --> 02:14:25,207
it should not be supported
by any government or society.

1861
02:14:25,499 --> 02:14:26,999
This is my prayer...

1862
02:14:27,374 --> 02:14:29,290
my request to you.

1863
02:14:29,499 --> 02:14:30,348
That's all, My Lord.

1864
02:14:33,374 --> 02:14:35,790
This Court will give
its verdict shortly.

1865
02:14:49,249 --> 02:14:51,082
No matter what the Court decides,

1866
02:14:51,624 --> 02:14:54,082
you're the best lawyer
Shree Ram could have.

1867
02:14:54,624 --> 02:14:55,957
You did very well.

1868
02:14:57,749 --> 02:15:01,124
All that is fine, professor
but if we lose this case today

1869
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:04,207
AP and Gabrielle's
sacrifice will go in vain.

1870
02:15:05,957 --> 02:15:07,665
Who was this AP?

1871
02:15:09,249 --> 02:15:10,832
I don't know... he said he was a guide.

1872
02:15:11,082 --> 02:15:12,957
I have no idea where he came from.

1873
02:15:14,958 --> 02:15:16,499
What I don't understand is...

1874
02:15:17,749 --> 02:15:22,040
despite having the rock with him,
why did he take us to Lanka?

1875
02:15:22,832 --> 02:15:24,499
I wonder why he lied to us.

1876
02:15:25,415 --> 02:15:27,624
Had he given the rock to you...

1877
02:15:27,999 --> 02:15:31,165
would you have so easily found
all these evidences related to Ramayan?

1878
02:15:32,749 --> 02:15:34,749
Everything happens for a reason, Aryan.

1879
02:15:37,082 --> 02:15:40,415
Check his bag,
you might find some information on him.

1880
02:15:46,749 --> 02:15:48,165
Coconut oil.

1881
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:51,082
Pen.

1882
02:15:51,665 --> 02:15:52,624
Yes!

1883
02:15:53,165 --> 02:15:54,499
Red notebook.

1884
02:15:54,790 --> 02:15:57,457
He would note down all our
travel expenses in this notebook.

1885
02:16:01,863 --> 02:16:04,915
This might contain some
information about his family.

1886
02:16:06,415 --> 02:16:08,165
I want to send them what we owe him.

1887
02:16:10,499 --> 02:16:11,499
Aryan!

1888
02:16:12,332 --> 02:16:13,832
They're about to give the verdict.

1889
02:16:15,542 --> 02:16:16,624
Come on. Let's go.

1890
02:16:16,992 --> 02:16:18,707
After hearing both sides,

1891
02:16:18,832 --> 02:16:20,832
Court has a few questions.

1892
02:16:21,832 --> 02:16:22,915
Ram Setu

1893
02:16:23,857 --> 02:16:25,290
or Adam's Bridge

1894
02:16:25,966 --> 02:16:27,874
that is thousands of years old...

1895
02:16:28,374 --> 02:16:31,707
is it not a part of Indian
and human history and heritage?

1896
02:16:32,249 --> 02:16:36,165
If it is,
who is responsible for saving it?

1897
02:16:36,457 --> 02:16:40,832
Shree Ram was not just a man,
he is part of Indian culture.

1898
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:42,999
What kind of a narrative is this

1899
02:16:43,665 --> 02:16:45,040
in which the government

1900
02:16:45,540 --> 02:16:49,582
is asking for proof that
Ram Setu was built by Shree Ram?

1901
02:16:50,207 --> 02:16:53,669
Millions of people who believe
in Shree Ram are being asked to testify

1902
02:16:53,749 --> 02:16:55,665
and provide evidence...

1903
02:16:56,707 --> 02:16:58,707
The Court wants to ask the government...

1904
02:16:58,874 --> 02:17:04,332
does it have proof that
Ram Setu was not built Shree Ram?

1905
02:17:05,999 --> 02:17:08,249
That Shree Ram is an imaginary figure,

1906
02:17:08,415 --> 02:17:11,082
the onus of proving it does not
lie on people who believe in Shree Ram

1907
02:17:11,162 --> 02:17:13,749
but on those who don't!

1908
02:17:14,582 --> 02:17:17,915
Therefore, the Court has decided,

1909
02:17:19,165 --> 02:17:23,915
until the government
provides scientific evidence

1910
02:17:24,082 --> 02:17:26,374
of Shree Ram not existing in history,

1911
02:17:27,082 --> 02:17:33,915
they do not have the right
to demolish Ram Setu.

1912
02:17:54,540 --> 02:17:56,957
Jai Shree Ram!

1913
02:17:57,832 --> 02:18:00,124
Jai Shree Ram!

1914
02:18:01,499 --> 02:18:03,832
Jai Shree Ram!

1915
02:18:05,332 --> 02:18:07,249
Jai Shree Ram!

1916
02:18:32,082 --> 02:18:35,874
Professor, can I get a cup of tea?

1917
02:18:36,165 --> 02:18:37,249
Of course.

1918
02:19:05,540 --> 02:19:09,040
Lord Indra looked at
the naughty boy and said,

1919
02:19:09,165 --> 02:19:14,457
'O son of Anjani, you will
be known as Hanuman today onwards'.

1920
02:19:14,582 --> 02:19:16,707
This is how he got his name Hanuman.

1921
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,124
Myself Anjaneya Pushpakumaran.

1922
02:19:25,249 --> 02:19:26,457
You can call me AP.

1923
02:19:33,688 --> 02:19:37,581
[Hanuman Chalisa]

1924
02:19:48,665 --> 02:19:50,707
You won't be able to
study Ram Setu like this.

1925
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:52,040
AP will help you.

1926
02:19:52,165 --> 02:19:53,707
AP knows Ram Setu like
the back of his hand.

1927
02:19:53,832 --> 02:19:55,999
I'm a guide... your journey is my gain.

1928
02:19:56,124 --> 02:19:58,332
All I do to help you,
I'll write in this diary.

1929
02:19:58,457 --> 02:19:59,127
[Jai Shree Ram]

1930
02:19:59,207 --> 02:20:01,707
When I was a child
I wanted to fly like a bird.

1931
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:04,832
One day, I stretched out my
hands and jumped out of the window.

1932
02:20:04,999 --> 02:20:06,790
I'm sure this is Sanjeevani...

1933
02:20:06,915 --> 02:20:08,707
Sri Pada is also known
as Trikut mountain.

1934
02:20:08,790 --> 02:20:11,332
You will find Ravana there,
as well as Shree Ram.

1935
02:20:11,582 --> 02:20:12,790
But who was this AP?
