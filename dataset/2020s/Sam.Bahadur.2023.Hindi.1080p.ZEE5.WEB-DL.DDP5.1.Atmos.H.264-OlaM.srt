1
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,958
May the Goddess bless you

2
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,125
with a shining destiny,
my son!

3
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,208
Hello, Cyrus!

4
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,291
Hilla...

5
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,625
Remember, I told you

6
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,833
about those thefts
at Perin Aunty's

7
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,208
and the other neighbours' homes?

8
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,513
The cops nabbed the thief.

9
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,416
Must we discuss this
in front of Cyrus?

10
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,791
The thief's name
is also Cyrus.

11
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:49,958
Oh!

12
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:53,333
Then we must think of
a new name for Cyrus!

13
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,791
Attention!

14
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,708
Guard...

15
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,500
Attention!

16
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,375
Guard!

17
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,875
General Salute!

18
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,416
Present Arms!

19
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,458
Guard!

20
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,291
Ground Arms!

21
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,125
What is your name?

22
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,750
Rifleman Harka Gurung, Sir!

23
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,208
Harka Gurung!

24
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,000
What is my name?

25
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,125
Sam...

26
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,291
Mac...

27
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,416
Monk...

28
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,250
Sam Bahadur, Sir!

29
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,500
Sam Bahadur.

30
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,875
We'll be punished, Sam!

31
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,875
Haji's right, Sam.

32
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,291
Let's head back.

33
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,416
What happened?

34
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,000
Nothing, just checking

35
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,625
if you're still alive.

36
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,583
What nonsense!
Of course, I'm alive!

37
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,541
Then prove it!

38
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,541
Well?

39
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,666
Well?

40
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,666
Sam, we came here at 7,

41
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,166
it's 9.30 now.

42
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,291
This is how time works,
sweetheart!

43
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,750
In some time,
it will be 10:30.

44
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,500
Then 11:30, and so on!

45
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,458
Sam, please.
Let's go!

46
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,083
What happened?

47
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,500
Am I boring you?

48
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,541
Of course not, sweetheart!

49
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,750
Meet my friends...

50
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,125
That is Maharaj Kumarjeet Singh...

51
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,084
And this is Haji Iftikar,

52
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,208
of the famous Iftikar family.

53
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,166
Maharaj, Nawab...

54
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,250
Do you think your friends
can be my friends, too?

55
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,500
And why not!

56
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,583
However...

57
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,333
These modern day princes

58
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,666
are pretty faint-hearted!

59
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,541
They're scared of everything:

60
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,916
the Company Commander,
the Adjutant,

61
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,166
the Quarter Master,

62
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,000
and of their punishment!

63
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,000
Who knows, you might
scare them, too!

64
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,916
Really?

65
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,125
You're in the Army?

66
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,958
Yes, ma'am...

67
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,750
Corporal Sam Manekshaw
at your service.

68
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,166
I'm a Gentleman Cadet, but...

69
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,291
I can't promise
I'll remain a gentleman!

70
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,208
Okay, Sam...

71
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,791
You stay back...

72
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,083
The last bus leaves
in 15 minutes...

73
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,416
Haji and I are leaving.

74
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,250
Gentlemen!

75
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,250
What's the first rule
of the Army?

76
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,958
"No man left behind."

77
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,291
Well, where were we?

78
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,791
We're dead!

79
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,125
For his absence from parade

80
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,041
and indiscipline,

81
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,166
by order of Major Cowan,

82
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,666
Corporal Sam Manekshaw

83
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,208
is awarded punishment.

84
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,958
Congratulations!

85
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,250
You have earned the
distinction of becoming

86
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,166
the first Gentleman Cadet

87
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,791
to be awarded a punishment

88
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,500
at the Indian Military Academy.

89
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,041
Don't!

90
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,166
Not.

91
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,333
One.

92
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,500
Word!

93
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,750
And you two...

94
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,041
It's not their fault, Sir.
I forced them and -

95
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,166
I said,

96
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,916
not one word!

97
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,958
The two of you,

98
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,375
along with Manekshaw

99
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,791
will be confined to barracks

100
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,250
with restrictions for 15 days.

101
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,666
One more instance,

102
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,250
and you are going home.

103
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,125
Am I clear?

104
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,125
Yes, Sir!

105
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,291
Manekshaw?

106
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,250
Yes, Sir!

107
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,750
That's two words, Sir.

108
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,583
Satisfied now? Huh?

109
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,500
That night was itself satisfying!

110
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,375
Enjoy your 15 day holiday, Sam...

111
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,375
In three weeks,

112
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,291
'The Butcher' will slaughter
your happiness!

113
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,666
Tikka Khan is coming!

114
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,000
Break!

115
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,125
Break!

116
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,291
Box!

117
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,125
Break!

118
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:45,625
Box!

119
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,291
Continue?

120
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,166
Break!

121
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,750
One...

122
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,916
Two...

123
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,125
Three...

124
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,291
Four...

125
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Five...

126
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,833
Six...

127
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,125
Seven...

128
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,458
Eight...

129
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,541
Nine...

130
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,583
Ten!

131
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,166
Well fought, Khan!

132
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,541
Next time,

133
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,500
victory will be mine...

134
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,708
And then I'll offer you

135
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,250
the same consolation.

136
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,666
We'll see!

137
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,875
2nd Lieutenant Sam Hormusji Framji
Jamshedji Manekshaw...

138
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,458
Sign here.

139
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,333
Your next posting

140
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,458
is with the 4th Battalion

141
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,500
of the 12th Frontier Force Regiment

142
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,166
stationed in Ferozepur.

143
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,291
Congratulations.

144
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,125
You are a Piffer now.

145
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,416
I am also a Piffer!

146
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,416
Look how pretty I am,

147
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,041
with my gorgeous light eyes

148
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,416
and fair skin!

149
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,333
Have you ever seen
such a pretty Piffer?

150
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,291
Hush, Dilsher...

151
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,208
He's the Platoon Commander.

152
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,125
Oh?

153
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,625
Congratulations then!

154
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,666
We have a girl as our
Platoon Commander!

155
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,583
Dilsher!

156
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,083
Even a girl can make this jump,

157
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,708
and a burly athlete
like you can't?

158
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,750
Lieutenant Manekshaw...

159
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,666
I...

160
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:09,791
Actually I...

161
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,166
...want to apologize?

162
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,416
Sorry, Lieutenant.

163
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,208
Sam.

164
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:22,958
Please, Sam!

165
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,916
I don't know anyone
at that party, Dilsher.

166
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,875
It's your friend's party,
you go.

167
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,541
You haven't really lived

168
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,333
until you've checked out
Lahore's party scene.

169
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,125
I thought of going alone,

170
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:34,500
but then I realised -

171
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,208
there'll be so many
pretty women there!

172
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,833
And who better than you

173
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,208
to teach me how
to charm them!

174
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,083
Really?

175
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:43,083
And I'm some expert
on charming women?

176
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,875
Drop the act, Sam!

177
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,875
The entire unit has heard
of your exploits.

178
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,083
Let's see you
in action tonight!

179
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,549
And I was staring...

180
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,166
not at the CO's wife,

181
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,791
but at the cake!

182
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,541
The CO's wife talked about

183
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,083
everything in the world...

184
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,208
but she never offered
us that bloody cake!

185
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,291
Who... is she?

186
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,125
Silloo Bode.

187
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,458
Colonel Bharucha's sister-in-law.

188
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,000
Excuse me.

189
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,125
Sam. Sam Manekshaw.

190
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,500
4th Battalion

191
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,166
12th Frontier Force Regiment.

192
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,666
Hello.

193
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,541
I'm Silloo.

194
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,833
I'm sorry.

195
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:32,750
Usually, I have a lot to say...

196
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,625
Clever, funny things...

197
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,708
Compliments...

198
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,750
But...

199
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,541
right now...

200
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,166
Thank God!

201
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,500
Because at every party,

202
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,291
every single guy says

203
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,833
the same boring things...

204
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,583
in an attempt to flirt.

205
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:56,958
I promise you,

206
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,500
I'll tell you something

207
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,458
that you haven't heard before.

208
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,166
That seems hard to believe.

209
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,708
But go on, try...

210
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,208
I'm going to marry you.

211
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,333
I...

212
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,625
Whatever it is...

213
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:24,375
Say it after this dance.

214
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,750
"This little thing...!"

215
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,958
"This little thing left unsaid"

216
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,291
"is a now confession made."

217
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,458
"This little thing, oh look"

218
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,583
"is now a fable made."

219
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,125
"Not a cloud nor rain"

220
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,291
"on that magical clear night..."

221
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,541
"Hearts didn't connive"

222
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,750
"nor cross the minds..."

223
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,250
"But a spell was cast"

224
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,208
"in the silver moonlight."

225
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,333
"This little thing, oh look"

226
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,250
"is now a fable made."

227
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,041
"This little thing...!"

228
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,625
"The ground firmly beneath us"

229
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,625
"The skies far and away"

230
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,583
"The ground firmly beneath us"

231
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,250
"The skies far and away"

232
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,125
"But floating up two inches"

233
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,916
"doesn't happen every day"

234
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,041
"As hearts take flight"

235
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,500
"making earth and sky sway."

236
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,750
"This little thing, oh look"

237
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:21,000
"is now a fable made."

238
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,500
"This little thing...!"

239
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,250
Mamma!

240
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,500
Sam, welcome!

241
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,416
Gurmeet...

242
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,416
Here you are.

243
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,708
Where have you
been posted?

244
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,166
And when do you
have to leave?

245
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,208
Allied armies gather
for new thrusts

246
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,041
against further Japanese
penetration in Burma.

247
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,916
World War II has reached
India's doorstep.

248
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,333
To counter the
Japanese troops,

249
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,500
the Indian Army
has reached Burma.

250
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,625
As soon as we hit Sittang,

251
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,750
we'll give our soldiers
a meal break, Turq.

252
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,833
They've fought non-stop
for 4 days...

253
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,750
If securing the bridge
wasn't so urgent,

254
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,250
I would've requested
Colonel Edwards

255
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,416
to give us a day
before moving.

256
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,250
I'm pretty starved myself!

257
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,458
I'd give anything
for some Dhansak.

258
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,041
- Dhansak?
- Yes!

259
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Most folks swear
by Rogan Josh,

260
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,583
but Parsi food
has my heart.

261
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,208
Come home for
a meal someday,

262
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,166
you'll be in for a treat!

263
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,916
Patra ni machhi, Akoori,
Lagan nu bhonu...

264
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,250
Chicken Farcha,

265
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,500
Salli Boti,

266
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,875
Lagan nu custard!

267
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,250
Oh, man!

268
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,833
Feed me some of that
delicious Parsi food again...

269
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,833
and Attiqur Rahman
will be your slave for life!

270
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,708
Just be my friend, Turq...

271
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,750
and every week,
you can enjoy both:

272
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,916
my company and
Parsi food as well!

273
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,458
Sounds great!

274
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,208
Down! Down!

275
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:01,625
Thank God,

276
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,583
our planes chased
the Japanese away!

277
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,875
- All okay?
- Yes.

278
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,958
Check the company
and report to me!

279
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,166
Slowly, slowly...

280
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,333
One, two, three...

281
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,375
Go!

282
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,625
Subedar Sahib!

283
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,708
Yes, Sir.

284
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:47,250
Get ready to move.

285
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,250
Meher Singh!

286
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,583
Come on! Get moving!

287
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,333
We have lost around 50 men.

288
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,333
Vehicles and equipment too.

289
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:22,500
From friendly fire

290
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:24,041
from our own planes!

291
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,916
A reconnaissance aircraft

292
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,583
relayed wrong information.

293
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,291
It was assumed

294
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,583
that the Japanese
were on the move.

295
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,625
It is unfortunate...

296
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,625
But we have our orders.

297
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,000
We cannot let the enemy

298
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,666
take control of the bridge.

299
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:41,666
So gentlemen...

300
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,875
talk to your men now,

301
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,291
and get them ready.

302
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:47,958
Sir.

303
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,958
This won't be easy...

304
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,041
Is war ever easy?

305
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,500
Sittang Bridge.

306
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:07,041
It's the only way
to get to Rangoon.

307
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,666
If Rangoon falls,

308
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,125
we fall too.

309
00:25:13,458 --> 00:25:15,791
So we just cannot
allow the Japanese

310
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:18,166
to capture Sittang Bridge.

311
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,833
Opposite Sittang Bridge
is Buddha Hill,

312
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,625
and on the left
is Pagoda Hill.

313
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,041
Apart from reinforcing
the bridgehead,

314
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:29,000
we have to capture
these hills too.

315
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,208
It will help us guard

316
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,250
and secure the bridge
in a better way.

317
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:33,625
And yes...

318
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,250
Because time is short,

319
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:42,041
the wounded and deceased

320
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,125
will not be brought
back to camp

321
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,291
until the operation
is complete.

322
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:54,541
Any doubts?

323
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:55,666
Any questions?

324
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:10,916
I know...

325
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,041
this is your fifth day
without sleep.

326
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,041
You've had your first meal
in four days

327
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,958
here at Sittang...

328
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,083
And we lost 50 of our men
on the way here...

329
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,833
That too, because of
a misunderstanding.

330
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,458
"He alone is brave"

331
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:41,000
"Who fights for
the downtrodden"

332
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,166
"He may get cut
into pieces"

333
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,166
"But he'll never leave
the battlefield!"

334
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,166
I'm sure you've all heard
this holy verse before.

335
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,083
I'm just reminding you...

336
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,333
It's our turn to fight tomorrow.

337
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,791
Bole So Nihaal!

338
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,083
Sat Sri Akal!

339
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:30,625
Are we ready

340
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,916
Subedar Gurbaksh Singh Sahib?

341
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,625
Yes, Sir. We're all set.

342
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,083
They are on Buddha Hill!

343
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,791
They are on Buddha Hill!

344
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,666
The Japanese have reached
Buddha Hill before us!

345
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:01,125
We must capture Pagoda Hill
before them. Now!

346
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,208
Bravo Company shall
stay in reserve.

347
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,333
Alpha Company,
charge to Pagoda Hill!

348
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:06,500
Meher Singh!

349
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,125
Move, fast!

350
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,083
Keep going!

351
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,208
Don't let the enemy
reach the peak!

352
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:58,666
We have to get the Japanese

353
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,041
off Buddha Hill too,
Subedar Sahib.

354
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,208
You guard this position
with your platoon...

355
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,916
the rest will charge
with me.

356
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,875
Bole So Nihaal!

357
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:07,541
Sat Sri Akal!

358
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,750
Don't stop!
Charge ahead!

359
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:49,666
Meher Singh...

360
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,291
I had said...

361
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,875
Only once the operation
is complete...

362
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:20,333
Bravo Company is also
reaching Buddha Hill, Sir!

363
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,000
It is too late to
operate on him.

364
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,208
He will not live.

365
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,041
His eyes were open
moments ago.

366
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,083
Please treat him!

367
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,250
Can you hear me, son?

368
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,125
How do you feel?

369
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,708
I'm OK!

370
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:56,791
What happened to you?

371
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,958
A bloody mule
kicked me!

372
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,000
Anyone with this
sense of humour

373
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:07,958
is worth saving!

374
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,541
Get him ready
for surgery.

375
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,708
For gallantry,

376
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,250
during the action
at the Sittang Bridge

377
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:37,458
on the 22nd and 23rd
of February 1942,

378
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,958
Major General Cowan

379
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,416
awards Major SHFJ Manekshaw

380
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,708
an immediate Military Cross.

381
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,125
Congratulations, Major Manekshaw.

382
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,916
Thank you, Sir!

383
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,125
Wow!

384
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,291
MC!

385
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,541
Well done, Sam!

386
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:18,666
You definitely owe me
a Parsi feast

387
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,208
at your home now!

388
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,458
You'll be back much
before me, Turq.

389
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,125
I'll be tied up here

390
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,333
in these bandages,
for a while.

391
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,416
In British India, it was the
wedding of the daughter

392
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,583
of the Indian National Congress
President Jawaharlal Nehru.

393
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,750
Several members were
present on the occasion

394
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,000
and blessed the new couple,

395
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,958
Indira Nehru and Feroze Gandhi.

396
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,500
Good choice...

397
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,666
Parsis do make good husbands!

398
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:51,041
The true answer
to this question,

399
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,916
I would like to hear
from Mrs Manekshaw...

400
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,958
Do Parsis really make

401
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,750
the best husbands?

402
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,000
I'll only let Mrs Khan
in on this secret,

403
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,208
Major Khan!

404
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:04,500
And not in front of

405
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:06,041
the two of you, for sure!

406
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,041
Sherry, Maja...

407
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,666
say goodnight to Major Khan.

408
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,458
But Silloo, the custard!

409
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,250
Custard on Sundays
for you.

410
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,708
You know the rules.

411
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:19,791
Goodnight, Major Khan.

412
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,166
- Goodnight, Father.
- Goodnight, darling.

413
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,458
Goodnight, Silloo.

414
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,000
Goodnight, Silloo!

415
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:32,791
Major Khan,

416
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,041
we'd love to meet
Begum Sahiba someday...

417
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,583
Surely...

418
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,708
Though...

419
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,125
the Missus has instantly
become 'Begum Sahiba'...

420
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,375
Then why such formality
towards me?

421
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,666
Not 'Major Khan',
please call me Yahya.

422
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,416
On one condition...

423
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,708
You too, must call me Silloo.

424
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,083
Definitely, Mrs...

425
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,958
Silloo.

426
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:58,291
So next time,

427
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,041
please bring Begum Sahiba along,

428
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,666
Yahya.

429
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,833
Surely...

430
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,416
She was a bit unwell today.

431
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,791
Or else she would've
loved to come

432
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:09,041
and listen to Sam's tales
from Burma.

433
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:10,333
Burma!

434
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:12,416
Yahya, when I think of Burma,

435
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,083
I'm reminded of
the doctors there...

436
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:16,375
Those bloody buggers,
I tell you...

437
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,875
They gave me such
bad stitches...

438
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,791
that by the time
I returned to India,

439
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,208
they were infested
with maggots!

440
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,375
Even the maggots were
better than those doctors.

441
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,458
Thanks to them,

442
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:26,875
I didn't get any infection.

443
00:34:27,458 --> 00:34:28,416
Excuse me.

444
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,625
Sam...

445
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:39,416
war gives us stories...

446
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,541
but to women...

447
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,208
they give nightmares.

448
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,166
Silloo...

449
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,416
Get custard made tomorrow.

450
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:08,041
Sam!

451
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:10,958
They're kids, Silloo...

452
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,458
Where to?

453
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,458
My room...

454
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,791
Because of these?

455
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,333
Because of your snoring, Sam!

456
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,958
The land will be divided.

457
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,041
Areas with Hindus in majority

458
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:45,666
will become their country.

459
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,375
Areas with Muslim majority

460
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:48,750
will become the Muslim nation.

461
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:52,666
What mercenaries
the British are...

462
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:56,375
The price they've made us
pay for our freedom!

463
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,250
Turq has chosen Pakistan.

464
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,541
He was saying that

465
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,375
Mr Jinnah has personally asked you

466
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,041
to join the Pakistan Army.

467
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,166
So?

468
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,416
What have you decided?

469
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:21,875
You're not a Hindu.

470
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:23,541
How are you an Indian, then?

471
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,208
I was born in Amritsar,

472
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,500
my wife is from Bombay,

473
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,166
and I work in Delhi...

474
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
How much more Indian
can I be?

475
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:40,458
Morning, boys!

476
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,625
What's happening?

477
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,416
We've been given orders, Sir...

478
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,708
Indian and Pakistani territory
maps are being divided.

479
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,250
The maps falling
in Indian territory

480
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,333
will be with the Indian army,

481
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,833
and the ones falling
in Pakistani territory

482
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,291
will go to the Pakistan army.

483
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,625
The maps of the Pakistan areas

484
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,250
will not leave this office

485
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,833
until the Indian army

486
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,416
has a copy of them.

487
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,791
Is that clear?

488
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:04,875
Yes, Sir.

489
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,666
- Sir.
- Yes?

490
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,416
Major Khan hasn't asked
for Indian maps...

491
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,416
I know.

492
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,416
- But... how do...
- Because I know Yahya.

493
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,708
He can feel the oncoming Partition...

494
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,750
but he can't fathom it yet.

495
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,750
Congrats on the Frontier Force Regiment,
Captain Farid.

496
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:37,166
And to you on the Madras Regiment,
Captain Srini.

497
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:38,000
Cheers.

498
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:38,833
Cheers.

499
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,083
This one...

500
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:54,916
to all the brothers
in this room!

501
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,375
I love you more
than life itself.

502
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:58,291
Speech!

503
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,916
Speech, speech, speech!

504
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:04,791
Speech, speech, speech!

505
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,541
Okay, okay...

506
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,291
To the fatal choice!

507
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,166
Punjabi!

508
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,208
Punjabi! Punjabi! Punjabi!

509
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,208
Fine!

510
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:22,500
Here.

511
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,166
Tonight, I raise a toast,

512
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,666
to the cruel choice
before us!

513
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,625
They make a goddamn porridge...

514
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,125
then ask us to separate
the oats from the milk!

515
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,958
The colour of this uniform

516
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,208
is seeped into our blood...

517
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,750
And now they ask us

518
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,875
to choose another colour!

519
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,625
Here...

520
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,791
They slit us down the middle
and then ask us

521
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,083
to choose one side
of our heart.

522
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,291
To the Army!

523
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,416
To the Army!

524
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,750
To the Army!

525
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,041
To the Army!

526
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,041
To the Indian Army!

527
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:51,541
Sam...

528
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,500
Every morning,
I'd wake up thinking:

529
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,208
I'll meet Sam again today.

530
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:01,291
But now...

531
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,541
now, after this Partition...

532
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:09,125
I have only one wish.

533
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:13,041
That I never have
to meet Sam again.

534
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:41,625
Sam...

535
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,041
I'll really miss you.

536
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,375
And your bike too.

537
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,166
You both have taken
such good care of me.

538
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,833
Keep the bike, then.

539
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:59,250
Hey, Sam!

540
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,166
Thank you!

541
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,208
1500 rupees.

542
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,416
You're selling it?

543
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,333
How heartless!

544
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,250
Not heartless, sensible.

545
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,500
I'm leaving the bike outside...

546
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,291
send me the money later.

547
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,208
Goodnight, my friend...

548
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,250
And goodbye.

549
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,166
Long years ago,

550
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:48,041
we made a tryst
with destiny,

551
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:51,208
and now the time comes

552
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:54,000
when we shall redeem
our pledge.

553
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:57,125
At the stroke of the
midnight hour,

554
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,333
when the world sleeps...

555
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:02,833
India will awake to
life and freedom.

556
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:27,958
Maharaja Hari Singh

557
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:30,375
has made an appeal
to us and Pakistan...

558
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
The Standstill Agreement...

559
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,750
This is Pakistan's response.

560
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,750
Pakistan has agreed.

561
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,833
That until talks take place

562
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:44,458
between their leaders

563
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,291
Pakistan will not take

564
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,000
any action on Kashmir.

565
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,166
That means we'll
have to accept

566
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,541
the Maharaja's request too.

567
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,083
I don't think India
should agree.

568
00:42:58,416 --> 00:43:00,041
Neither should you disagree.

569
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,500
Until the Maharaja
makes up his mind,

570
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,500
which country he wants
to be a part of...

571
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,375
Don't say yes...

572
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,416
Don't say no.

573
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:14,583
Did you advise
Pakistan similarly,

574
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:15,916
Lord Mountbatten?

575
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,083
Because they have accepted

576
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,000
the Maharaja's request.

577
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,666
I wonder why...

578
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,291
What a great parting gift
they've given us!

579
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:37,875
They came to one country,

580
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,833
and they're leaving behind two!

581
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,291
Hindustan and Pakistan...

582
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,166
Hindus and Muslims...

583
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,458
Divide and Rule!

584
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,583
What a legacy these
Britishers are leaving us...

585
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,000
Sir.

586
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:10,250
Hazara,

587
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,083
Afridi,

588
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:11,958
Mahsud...

589
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:14,583
Even Pakistan army soldiers

590
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,708
who were on leave...

591
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,916
are crossing the border
in truckloads

592
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,375
to attack Srinagar!

593
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,583
And you all knew
about this.

594
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:25,916
The CGS,

595
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,333
the Officiating DMO,

596
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,083
and the Defence Minister!

597
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,083
When were you planning
to inform me?

598
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:33,250
After the Pakistan flag
has unfurled over Srinagar?

599
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,875
The intel wasn't solid.
Kalkat's report-

600
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,500
I don't want to hear a word
from you anymore.

601
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:40,541
Major Kalkat, you tell me.

602
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:42,125
I'll decide

603
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,750
whether the intel
is solid or not.

604
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,041
'Operation Gulmarg'
is a masterstroke, Sir.

605
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,166
One solution to Pakistan's
three problems.

606
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,083
The Pathanistan Movement
will be crushed.

607
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,458
The tribals will get land
for settlement,

608
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,458
and Kashmir will belong
to Pakistan.

609
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:55,791
And you're sure

610
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,333
the Pakistan Army
is involved?

611
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,666
Yes, Sir.

612
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,750
Pakistan Commander-in-Chief
General Messervy

613
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:03,250
sent the operation plan
to Brigadier C P Murray.

614
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:04,791
As soon as I found out,

615
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:06,583
they put me under
house arrest...

616
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:07,916
But I escaped.

617
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,000
Brigadier Murray knew,

618
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,750
but he still didn't
inform us...

619
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,166
Is the Partition between us
not enough...

620
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:17,625
that we have to be
at war now, too?

621
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,583
Kashmir needs our help,
Sardar...

622
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,916
Yes, but we need

623
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,416
Maharaja Hari Singh's
decision first:

624
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,875
That Kashmir is
a part of India.

625
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,125
No?

626
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,875
Menon...

627
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,166
Leave for Srinagar
right away...

628
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:40,541
And...

629
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,583
Take Manekshaw with you.

630
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:44,791
Yes.

631
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:47,833
Keep both the airfields ready...

632
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,833
and keep a unit at hand,
on standby.

633
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,750
Also, find out how many
more Dakotas

634
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,958
we have on the ready.

635
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,083
Relay all this information

636
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:55,833
to Srinagar airfield as well...

637
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:57,416
I need all of this done
in the next hour.

638
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,333
Sir.

639
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:07,583
Major.

640
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,333
Our pilot has informed us

641
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,166
that the Srinagar airfield runway

642
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,208
does not have lights.

643
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:15,916
So?

644
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,333
So we must take-off

645
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:19,250
for Delhi before sunset.

646
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,791
So we have only
half an hour to do this?

647
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,666
According to the latest reports,

648
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:29,875
the armed tribal groups

649
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,333
have reached Baramullah.

650
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,041
Only 35 miles away
from Srinagar.

651
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,125
If they get to Srinagar

652
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:37,916
with the Pakistan Army's help

653
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:40,625
and capture the airfield...

654
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:44,458
the Indian army will not
be able to reach Srinagar.

655
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,750
We will lose Kashmir.

656
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:21,833
Maharaj...

657
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,666
Secretary VP Menon and-

658
00:48:23,791 --> 00:48:25,541
You've taken so long
to arrive...

659
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:29,000
while those plunderers
are taking over Kashmir!

660
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,458
Seems like I'll have to
handle this on my own.

661
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:32,708
I'll fight...

662
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,416
I'll fight with my army!

663
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,625
Your Highness...

664
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,291
We came as soon as
we got the news.

665
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,916
I've been calling for help,
for so long...

666
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,458
And you just got the news?

667
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:43,125
You've come too late.

668
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,666
This is my home...

669
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,333
and to protect it,

670
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:48,583
I'm ready to spill blood...

671
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,625
whether it's mine,
or of my enemies.

672
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:55,666
Your Highness...

673
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:57,833
Please come.

674
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,083
You want to spill
blood, right?

675
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:01,666
Please come...

676
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,916
The M1 Garand...

677
00:49:07,666 --> 00:49:09,041
30 caliber, gas-operated,

678
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,458
8-shot, clip fed.

679
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:12,541
Easy to fire.

680
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:13,833
Easy to handle.

681
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:15,250
And reloads in an instant.

682
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:16,625
A trained soldier can

683
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,708
fire 15-20 accurate
shots per minute

684
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:21,458
to a distance of
about 300 yards.

685
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,083
I'm sure you'll easily manage

686
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,291
8-10 shots at the very least.

687
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:29,875
This is war, Your Highness.

688
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,041
My soldiers and I
are trained for it.

689
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:36,708
You please handle
the politics,

690
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:38,750
as you are trained for it.

691
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:41,625
Your Highness...

692
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:43,250
Please come.

693
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:59,208
I'll see you at the airfield,
Mr Menon.`

694
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:12,958
Is it done?

695
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:14,958
But there's no point...

696
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,125
We won't be able
to reach Delhi.

697
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,250
How will we take off
in this darkness, Sam?

698
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:54,750
I can now see

699
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:57,083
why I was asked
to take you along.

700
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,208
What's the matter, Sam?

701
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,291
Mission accomplished.

702
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,958
Bosses will be happy!

703
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,833
My boss won't be happy.

704
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:50,583
I had promised her

705
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,416
that I'd be back home by 7.

706
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:55,916
And in any case,

707
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,875
only your mission
is accomplished.

708
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:00,333
Our mission will

709
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,458
begin only now.

710
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,208
In a fierce war
spanning 2 years

711
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,375
the Indian Army
and Air Force

712
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,166
secured Srinagar
and cleared Kashmir

713
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,083
from Poonch to Dras-Kargil

714
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:30,666
of the Tribal and
Pakistani invaders.

715
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,250
Even the song is
not playing now!

716
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,583
He has become the Commandant
of the Staff College,

717
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,041
happily running the place,

718
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,208
training officers...

719
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,666
And what did I get?

720
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,583
A matchbox-sized kitchen!

721
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:07,416
If Sir keeps getting
promoted like this,

722
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:09,708
I'll soon be cooking,
sitting inside a saucepan!

723
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:15,250
This is Akashvani.
And now the news.

724
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,958
The Indian National Congress held

725
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,625
a special election in Delhi.

726
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,583
The Congress Committee
has selected

727
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:21,750
Mrs Indira Gandhi

728
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:23,458
as their new President.

729
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,708
Major General Manekshaw...

730
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,166
I must admit,

731
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,583
you run a tight ship here.

732
00:53:32,708 --> 00:53:33,958
Thank you, Sir.

733
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:45,208
What could be more reassuring
for a Defence Minister...

734
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:47,375
Than knowing that
the responsibility

735
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,000
of training this country's officers

736
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:50,666
is in your able hands!

737
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,041
Right, Kaul?

738
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:53,291
Sir.

739
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,666
Thank you, Minister.

740
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:56,208
I have some suggestions

741
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,833
for your training module, Sam...

742
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:59,333
which can make it better.

743
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,000
Of course, Sir!

744
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:02,958
I'm sure we can
greatly benefit

745
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,458
from your extensive
war experience.

746
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,333
By the way...

747
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:10,583
Which front did you fight at?

748
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,625
He may not have
field experience,

749
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,708
but he surely has the
mind of a strategist.

750
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,166
I'm sure!

751
00:54:20,666 --> 00:54:22,125
This way, gentlemen!

752
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:28,583
There's something else
I wanted to ask you, Sam...

753
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,458
I wanted your opinion...

754
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,625
on a few Officers.

755
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,458
My opinion goes straight
into my Officers'

756
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,916
Annual Confidential Reports,
Minister.

757
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,708
I don't mean 'your' Officers...

758
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:43,708
I'm talking about your Chief.

759
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:47,083
What do you think of
General Thimmayaa?

760
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:48,666
Please don't.

761
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:52,500
Today, you're asking me
about my Chief...

762
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:53,875
Tomorrow, you'll ask

763
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,291
my Brigadiers and Colonels
about me.

764
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:59,000
The Army's discipline

765
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,208
is its very foundation.

766
00:55:01,791 --> 00:55:04,458
Don't shake the Army's foundation...

767
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:05,875
...Minister.

768
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:27,208
What happened at the DSSC

769
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,708
was totally out of line, Sir.

770
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,583
So what if I don't have
war experience?

771
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm his senior officer,

772
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,916
and the Chief of General Staff!

773
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,583
That's why he's jealous of me.

774
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,500
And that's why he hates me!

775
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:43,583
No, no...

776
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,375
Sam doesn't hate anyone.

777
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:47,833
He just loves himself more.

778
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,791
The only problem is

779
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:52,750
that everyone else
loves him too.

780
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:55,041
Especially PM Nehru.

781
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,125
We must do something, Sir.

782
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,125
Anti-National?

783
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,000
Apart from anti-national activity,

784
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,250
there are other
serious charges too.

785
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,500
An enquiry must be done, Kaul...

786
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,208
But Anti-Nationalism?

787
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,875
This letter, such charges...?

788
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,750
You've seen his office, right?

789
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,250
It's been 14 years
since Independence

790
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:32,708
but he's still loyal
to the British.

791
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,375
He's forgotten

792
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,125
that his seniors and ministers

793
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,875
are all Indian.

794
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,750
His biggest problem is...

795
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:41,125
Not one problem...

796
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,166
There's a list of problems.

797
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,375
But is this list

798
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,250
enough for an enquiry?

799
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,375
We're talking about
Major General Sam Manekshaw, Kaul...

800
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,625
not some junior officer
or Corporal!

801
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:05,750
Of course, Sir.

802
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,000
And...

803
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,166
this enquiry will take place

804
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,208
under the General Staff Branch.

805
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:21,500
Impressive, Kaul!

806
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:23,958
So it's your field,

807
00:57:24,291 --> 00:57:25,708
and your rules...

808
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:27,541
You've set this up
quiet efficiently!

809
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:40,791
Manekshaw residence.

810
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,583
Hello...

811
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:44,916
Hello?

812
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,166
Sehroo Bhai.

813
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,583
Silloo... what's the matter?

814
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,333
No, it's nothing...

815
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:53,916
Just that inquiry.

816
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,583
And Sam?

817
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,708
Sam...

818
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,791
You know him...

819
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,541
Ask him anything,

820
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:02,875
the answer is the same:

821
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:04,958
"I'm OK!"

822
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,666
Anti-National, and you?

823
00:58:12,541 --> 00:58:13,500
Sam...

824
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,333
I think this is personal.

825
00:58:18,875 --> 00:58:20,041
This Kaul...

826
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,375
He's always been
jealous of you.

827
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,041
Professional disagreements
are routine, Silloo...

828
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:29,041
Why would Kaul have a
personal problem with me?

829
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:32,625
You never see any problem
in anyone, Sam...

830
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:36,000
You think everyone's
good at heart.

831
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,666
What if...

832
00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,166
What if they win, Sam?

833
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,125
I already won

834
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,958
my life's biggest challenge

835
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,125
the night you agreed

836
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,458
to dance with me
at that party.

837
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,375
I'll handle the other
battles as well.

838
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:06,750
I'm OK!

839
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:08,000
Trust me...

840
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,083
And everything will be OK.

841
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,041
Soon.

842
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,333
I promise.

843
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,250
Come inside...

844
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:21,458
Sherry's getting her
boyfriend to meet us...

845
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:23,458
That Batliwala?

846
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:28,708
Sam... the house is that way.

847
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,041
Silloo...

848
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,041
Our daughter will become
'Sherry Batliwala'!

849
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:35,208
I can handle the inquiry,

850
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:37,375
but this is too much!

851
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,166
This Court of inquiry
has assembled

852
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:54,208
to investigate into the
incidents of impropriety

853
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:58,625
by Major General Sam Hormusji
Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw,

854
00:59:58,791 --> 00:59:59,833
Military Cross.

855
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,458
That have been brought
to the notice

856
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:02,791
of the convening authority.

857
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:09,708
Everything alright?

858
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:13,375
This... isn't right, Sir.

859
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:20,583
Things will be alright...

860
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,666
It will be OK.

861
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:35,083
The first matter against

862
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,875
Major General Manekshaw is

863
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,416
Anti-Nationalism.

864
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:42,625
Is it true that
at the Staff College,

865
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,791
instead of Indian leaders,

866
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:47,250
you've put up portraits
of British Viceroys,

867
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,625
Army chiefs and Generals?

868
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,291
Yes, it's true...

869
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,916
because the DSSC
trains Army Officers,

870
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:58,958
not Politicians.

871
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,750
The second charge is:

872
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,333
Violating the orders
of your senior Officer.

873
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,541
Wilful Disobedience.

874
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,041
It says here,
Major General Manekshaw,

875
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:16,125
that you received a letter
from the office

876
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:19,333
of the Chief of General Staff
B M Kaul.

877
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:23,416
That you deliberately ignored.

878
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,375
You mean he was expecting

879
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,125
a response to that?

880
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:31,500
My apologies

881
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:32,958
that I failed to send

882
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:34,583
an appropriate reply.

883
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:36,958
Let me correct that
mistake right away.

884
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:43,458
The CGS's letter asked
for 50 soldiers

885
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,750
to complete the construction

886
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:47,750
of barracks swiftly.

887
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:52,666
I will not give my soldiers, Sir.

888
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:56,875
But yes, if he requires
workers or labourers,

889
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,583
I know a few contractors.

890
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,916
I can connect the CGS to them.

891
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,208
Perhaps they can also explain
the difference to him...

892
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,208
About what labourers do...

893
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,333
and what soldiers do.

894
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:25,750
Sir, someone in the mess
told me...

895
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:27,125
So you never actually heard

896
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,250
Major General Manekshaw
say this in person?

897
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,458
No, Sir.

898
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:32,041
No, Sir..

899
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:34,291
Colonel, did you
or did you not hear

900
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,250
Major General Manekshaw say:

901
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,000
'He doesn't want his Officers

902
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,708
'to marry women who
resemble housemaids'?

903
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:47,625
It is time to conclude

904
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:49,791
the findings of this
Court of inquiry.

905
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,416
I agree, General.

906
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:53,625
We needn't waste
any more time

907
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,208
on useless questions.

908
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:59,666
Major General Sam Hormusji
Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw...

909
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,791
This Committee believes
that all charges

910
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,125
raised in this inquiry

911
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:04,375
are unjustified.

912
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,458
They are utterly baseless

913
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:07,750
and without any merit.

914
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:09,708
Therefore...

915
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:10,875
This enquiry is

916
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,375
terminated.

917
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:30,958
It took some time...

918
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,833
But I had told you...

919
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:34,916
It will be OK.

920
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:45,875
Swami...

921
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,875
The most important thing in
a sandwich isn't the bread...

922
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,208
but the filling in between!

923
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,833
There should be more of it!

924
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,458
The market is short
on supplies

925
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,250
because of the war.

926
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:04,625
Very soon, the sandwiches
will have no filling at all!

927
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,083
These Chinese!

928
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:09,125
The very mention of them
makes me fume!

929
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:10,875
That's it!

930
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:12,708
I'm banning fine china
in the house.

931
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,000
From now on,
we'll only use steel.

932
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:16,583
Boycott China!

933
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,541
I've been saying
this for ages,

934
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:21,458
Filter coffee tastes better
in steel mugs!

935
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:23,083
And I also taught you

936
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:25,125
how to make authentic
filter coffee, didn't I?

937
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:29,791
Your filter coffee is
far from authentic!

938
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:33,666
God knows how
Madam tolerates him!

939
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,041
And now, an important
announcement...

940
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,333
After China's attack on Assam,

941
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,833
Prime Minister
Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru

942
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:47,875
shall address the nation...

943
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:52,333
Chinese forces have been

944
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,250
aggressively attacking
our borders.

945
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,416
Right now...

946
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:04,333
Enemy forces are
at Assam's doorstep.

947
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,416
And Assam is in danger.

948
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,208
We have lost
Bomdila as well.

949
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:16,500
At this moment,

950
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,500
my heart truly goes out

951
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,791
to our brothers and sisters
in Assam.

952
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:29,291
It pains me to think
of their suffering,

953
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:32,125
No, Prime Minister!

954
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,250
This isn't right.

955
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:36,875
Why?

956
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:41,333
'My heart goes out
to the people of Assam'?

957
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:44,166
He sounds so helpless!

958
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,333
If the Prime Minister

959
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:49,000
is going to comes across
as feeble and helpless

960
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,000
who will give hope and
courage to our people?

961
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:53,666
"Indian and Chinese,
brothers-in-arms!"

962
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,958
What backstabbing brothers!

963
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:57,958
Of course he's helpless.

964
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,416
Sam...

965
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,666
What about the promotion?

966
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:08,750
Any news?

967
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:16,750
You should have been
a part of this war, Sam...

968
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:19,666
You're a soldier.

969
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,750
You belong at the front...

970
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,125
with the other soldiers.

971
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:34,125
I know that Swami wants me
out of the house...

972
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:36,458
but you, too?

973
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,791
I don't want you
to go anywhere, Sam.

974
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:48,291
I just want you to reach
where you're destined.

975
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:54,041
But your destiny is

976
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,500
not going to fulfil itself.

977
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,750
Tell me, what do I do?

978
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:07,666
What do I tell you Sam?

979
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,791
I can't fathom anything myself.

980
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:12,791
This war, this defeat...

981
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,833
I can't see my own future.

982
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,833
How do I tell you about yours?

983
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:38,125
I'm sorry, but
this is important.

984
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:42,291
Please give us 5 minutes.

985
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,375
Prime Minister.

986
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:50,041
After your speech,
there's chaos in Tezpur.

987
01:07:50,625 --> 01:07:52,500
People have lost faith
in the Army,

988
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:53,875
and the Government.

989
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,875
China may have betrayed us,

990
01:07:59,083 --> 01:08:01,125
but we've been careless too!

991
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,041
We've failed to prepare
our troops

992
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,875
to combat the Chinese army,

993
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,958
or provide them with
weapons and equipment.

994
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,791
Instead of making

995
01:08:09,916 --> 01:08:11,583
our Army combat-ready,

996
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,500
we were making them
do construction work!

997
01:08:17,457 --> 01:08:19,750
Krishna Menon must resign.

998
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:21,457
And...

999
01:08:22,457 --> 01:08:24,875
Y B Chavan will be our
new Defense Minister.

1000
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,666
Kaul must go too.

1001
01:08:29,332 --> 01:08:31,166
But in this situation,

1002
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:33,125
who can replace him?

1003
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:38,541
I know.

1004
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:44,666
The gentleman in
the waiting room -

1005
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,832
Please send him inside.

1006
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:56,541
I believe you know
Major General Sam Manekshaw.

1007
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,416
Sam, Indira.

1008
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,791
We'll rehearse the
Christmas Day scene.

1009
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,291
It's Christmas morning.

1010
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,416
Everything should be
relaxed and easy.

1011
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:22,832
Bert and Lorraine
will be seated together.

1012
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,582
Take your positions.

1013
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:33,707
What happened?

1014
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,750
How did it go?

1015
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,166
Very good.

1016
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:44,625
Finish your rehearsal,
I'll wait.

1017
01:09:45,457 --> 01:09:46,916
So let's take it
from the top...

1018
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:04,958
So?

1019
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,708
Where's our next posting?

1020
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Tezpur, Assam.

1021
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,625
But not 'our' posting,

1022
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,000
just mine.

1023
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:23,500
It's a non-family station,
Silloo...

1024
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,541
The on-ground situation

1025
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:27,208
is still dangerous.

1026
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,541
I know.

1027
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:31,666
It's just that...

1028
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:35,541
It's not easy.

1029
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:37,958
I know.

1030
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,833
I know how tough it is

1031
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:41,833
for you,

1032
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,250
for us,

1033
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,375
for the girls...

1034
01:10:51,666 --> 01:10:53,250
That's where you belong, Sam.

1035
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:56,333
With your soldiers.

1036
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,958
We will all be OK.

1037
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:13,208
How is she?

1038
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:15,458
Who?

1039
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:17,916
Indira.

1040
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:23,208
She dresses well.

1041
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,416
And she's definitely,
less emotional

1042
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,041
than Prime Minister Nehru.

1043
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,416
And is that a good
or bad thing?

1044
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:35,666
Time will tell.

1045
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,833
The morale of the soldiers
is down, Sir.

1046
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:45,083
We have failed in
encouraging them to fight

1047
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,708
or even lead them well.

1048
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,791
Delhi is so far
from Assam,

1049
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:50,750
it feels like no one
remembers us.

1050
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,625
Your quarters are
this way, Sir.

1051
01:12:08,166 --> 01:12:09,416
Commander Sir.

1052
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:27,958
Good evening, gentlemen!

1053
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,208
Good evening, Sir!

1054
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,916
What is the most
precious thing

1055
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,500
for any human being?

1056
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:39,625
Stop thinking about your own

1057
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:40,750
and others' girlfriends!

1058
01:12:40,875 --> 01:12:41,875
Answer me, boys!

1059
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,125
His life, Sir.

1060
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:48,416
Correct.

1061
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,750
But for a soldier,

1062
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:54,958
even more precious
than his life...

1063
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,375
is his honour.

1064
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,125
His uniform.

1065
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,125
And to protect this honour,

1066
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,833
a soldier can even
sacrifice his life.

1067
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:05,166
Right?

1068
01:13:05,416 --> 01:13:06,375
Yes, Sir.

1069
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,041
You haven't eaten today?

1070
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,333
Am I right?

1071
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:11,500
Yes, Sir!

1072
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,958
From today,
no officer or soldier

1073
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:19,083
shall withdraw from his post

1074
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:21,291
without my written orders...

1075
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:23,666
And I am

1076
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,666
never going to give
those orders!

1077
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:27,541
Gentlemen,

1078
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,666
there will be
no more withdrawals.

1079
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,583
Sam is here!

1080
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,000
Yes, Sir!

1081
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:47,291
This is the Commander Sir
we needed...

1082
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:50,333
Who tells us what to do!

1083
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:52,916
I know what to do.

1084
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:54,541
We've been studying

1085
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:57,333
the movements of the
Chinese forces for a while.

1086
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,916
Our team has prepared a plan.

1087
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:03,416
We need to strengthen
our forward posts,

1088
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:05,708
protect our passes,

1089
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,291
and most importantly...

1090
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,125
we must secure our
borders with China.

1091
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:13,458
Sam...

1092
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:14,500
Sir.

1093
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:17,166
Chairman Mao has
declared a ceasefire.

1094
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,458
I don't think we
should violate it.

1095
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,000
I agree with Panditji.

1096
01:14:25,791 --> 01:14:27,875
There is no need
for deployment right now.

1097
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,333
A wait-and-watch position

1098
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:30,333
is what we should take.

1099
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:34,083
Besides, since you've
taken command,

1100
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:36,500
the situation has
improved significantly.

1101
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,375
The situation has returned

1102
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,583
to normal with
great difficulty...

1103
01:14:43,416 --> 01:14:45,291
We should let it
remain normal.

1104
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:47,125
Normal, Minister?

1105
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,291
The situation was
so 'normal',

1106
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,916
that my soldiers
wanted to leave

1107
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:53,125
not just their posts,

1108
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,958
but the Army itself.

1109
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,666
They don't want 'normal'.

1110
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:01,500
What they want is a chance

1111
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:04,708
to win back their lost honour.

1112
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,500
They want reassurance,

1113
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:10,416
that our government in Delhi
hasn't forgotten about them.

1114
01:15:12,666 --> 01:15:14,208
They don't want 'normal',
Minister...

1115
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,250
They want to win.

1116
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,250
And I want to win.

1117
01:15:23,041 --> 01:15:24,333
China will withdraw
its troops

1118
01:15:24,458 --> 01:15:26,250
before the passes
close down.

1119
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,708
Or their supply line
will be cut off

1120
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:29,875
and we'll crush them.

1121
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,875
I don't think they will
make that error.

1122
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:34,000
Instead of waiting for them

1123
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:35,333
to make a move,

1124
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,916
we must secure
ourselves first.

1125
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,291
And if you can't
trust my soldiers

1126
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,208
and give them
this chance,

1127
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,125
I'm afraid I have
nothing to do here,

1128
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,958
please send me back.

1129
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,708
You're not going
anywhere, Sam.

1130
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,791
Our soldiers are
raring to win.

1131
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:04,458
If we don't support them,
who will?

1132
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:06,916
So we'll just let our soldiers
become cannon fodder?

1133
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,708
It is a soldier's duty

1134
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,291
to die for the nation.

1135
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,583
I beg your pardon, Madam.

1136
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:14,000
A soldier's duty is

1137
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:17,291
to kill the enemy and
protect the nation.

1138
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:21,791
Okay, Sam.

1139
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:23,375
What do you suggest?

1140
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,583
Shall we head
to the Ops room?

1141
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:26,458
We've identified some posts

1142
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,041
which must be secured.

1143
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,208
Panditji!

1144
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,708
Shall we go to
the Guest House?

1145
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:42,875
I think it's the heat
and humidity, that's all...

1146
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,208
You will feel better in
two minutes, Prime Minister.

1147
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,625
I'm sorry, Madam...

1148
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,583
You don't have
security clearance

1149
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:08,958
for the Ops Room.

1150
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:10,958
Please wait here.

1151
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:22,041
That's the spirit, gentlemen!

1152
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,000
Yes, Sir!

1153
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,041
5 Div will dare their lives

1154
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,375
to protect their land
and honour.

1155
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,166
Yes, Sir!

1156
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:30,250
And no one can snatch
this away from you!

1157
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:31,083
Yes, Sir!

1158
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:33,291
- Badri Vishal Lal ki!
- Jai!

1159
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:35,375
- Badri Vishal Lal ki!
- Jai!

1160
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,541
India's first Prime Minister,

1161
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,458
Mr Jawaharlal Nehru

1162
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:49,833
has passed away
due to a heart attack.

1163
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,000
74-year old
Pandit Nehru's health

1164
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,125
had been on the decline
for a while.

1165
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:59,125
The entire country
mourns his death today.

1166
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,375
On the face of it,

1167
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,291
since China declared
a ceasefire,

1168
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:16,833
both armies decided
to lay low.

1169
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,000
But the flames of discord
rising in Nagaland,

1170
01:18:21,541 --> 01:18:23,000
are being fanned
by China.

1171
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,458
We also need to control

1172
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,416
the civil unrest in Calcutta,

1173
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:28,708
Mr Defence Minister.

1174
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:30,625
So tell me Sam...

1175
01:18:31,083 --> 01:18:32,166
what have you thought?

1176
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,083
Where do you want
to be posted next?

1177
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,291
I wasn't aware that
the Indian Army

1178
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:40,750
gives its Officers a choice!

1179
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,333
Or is it because
you want to

1180
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,250
send me somewhere far off?

1181
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,208
What do you think, Sam...

1182
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,541
Which is the most
challenging posting

1183
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:52,791
in the Indian Army?

1184
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:01,708
Wonderful!

1185
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:03,791
China on one side,

1186
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:05,583
East Pakistan on the other...

1187
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,083
and problems all around!

1188
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:10,250
Why did you have to pick
the Eastern Command?

1189
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,875
Just choose any
nice photo, Sam...

1190
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,916
It's been a year since
Sherry's wedding,

1191
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:29,791
and you still can't decide

1192
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:31,333
which photo to frame!

1193
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,958
You can't take a
single decision at home,

1194
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,000
God knows how you
manage the Army!

1195
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:40,000
Doesn't listen to anyone.
Just does his own thing!

1196
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,541
What's the matter, Swami?

1197
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:46,916
What's the matter?

1198
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:51,500
Before my transistor
can find its frequency,

1199
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:53,333
your new transfer order arrives!

1200
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,000
At ease, boys.

1201
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,041
What's going on?

1202
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:23,708
The Rifleman is
saluting me, Sir!

1203
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,875
I can see that.

1204
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:25,708
Any reason?

1205
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,000
I was on my rounds, Sir.

1206
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,875
Rifleman Tamang
didn't salute me.

1207
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:31,083
For not saluting
a senior Officer,

1208
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,458
I've given Rifleman Tamang

1209
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,166
a punishment of
a 1000 salutes!

1210
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:36,083
Tamang?

1211
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:37,500
It was an honest mistake, Sir.

1212
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,208
I didn't see the Captain.

1213
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:41,291
Good job, Captain.

1214
01:20:41,458 --> 01:20:42,333
Thank you, Sir!

1215
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,458
That's how we maintain
discipline in the unit!

1216
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:46,583
Carry on!

1217
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:56,208
The Army has a rule -

1218
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,541
a salute must be
reciprocated with a salute.

1219
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,625
So Captain,

1220
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,250
you will return every salute

1221
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,541
from Rifleman Tamang.

1222
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:24,791
Very well!

1223
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,333
Come, Behroze.

1224
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,541
Sir, just a reminder:

1225
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,166
Today is the soldiers' feast.

1226
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,458
We will drink rum, Behroze.

1227
01:21:41,666 --> 01:21:43,041
Arrange rum for everyone.

1228
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:44,250
Sir.

1229
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,333
In the Congress Party's
legislative elections,

1230
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:50,625
Mrs Indira Gandhi has
beaten Mr Morarji Desai

1231
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,708
by a margin of 186 votes.

1232
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:54,750
Winning a total of 355 votes,

1233
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:56,541
Mrs Indira Gandhi is elected as

1234
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:58,166
India's third Prime Minister.

1235
01:21:58,333 --> 01:22:01,250
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance

1236
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,166
to the Constitution of India,

1237
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:05,291
to the Constitution of India,

1238
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:07,625
as by law established.

1239
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,500
as by law established.

1240
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,500
Congratulations!

1241
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:16,166
Cheers!

1242
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:21,416
- Hey Joe...
- Yes, Sir.

1243
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:22,958
- How's your wife?
- Fine, Sir.

1244
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:24,208
Still afraid of her?

1245
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,750
Not at all, Sir.
No fear!

1246
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:27,000
No fear!

1247
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,041
Well, those who claim
to have no fear...

1248
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,916
are either liars,

1249
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:33,541
or they are Gorkhas!

1250
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,625
- Right, Sir!
- Right, Sir!

1251
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:37,833
Hey, Behroze!

1252
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,458
Whenever I look at you,

1253
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:42,958
you must have a drink
in your hand!

1254
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,375
That's an order!

1255
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:51,125
Sir, why do you call Behram
'Behroze'?

1256
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:53,458
This bugger, I tell you!

1257
01:22:53,958 --> 01:22:55,500
Got selected in the Army,

1258
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:57,333
and got posted in Signals.

1259
01:22:57,708 --> 01:22:58,666
One day, during lunch,

1260
01:22:58,791 --> 01:23:00,291
he calls me and says:

1261
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:02,500
'Sir, if I can't work with you,

1262
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:04,000
I'll quit the Army!'

1263
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,333
I was hungry,

1264
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:07,583
and the line was poor...

1265
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,958
I heard Behroze
instead of Behram.

1266
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:11,041
And ever since,
he's Behroze to me!

1267
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,625
Party over, gentlemen!

1268
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,125
We have to get to work.

1269
01:23:27,541 --> 01:23:28,750
Sir, how did you know...

1270
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,500
It has to be an emergency,
sweetie...

1271
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,958
or you'd never disobey

1272
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:34,541
my direct order.

1273
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:36,208
Now tell me.

1274
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,416
There have been attacks
in Lunglei and Aizawl.

1275
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:39,875
Mizo National Front.

1276
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,083
The MNF troops have made

1277
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:53,625
the villagers' lives hell.

1278
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:55,708
They take away their rations

1279
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:58,125
and forcibly induct
their children

1280
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,625
into their army.

1281
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:02,250
Some of the locals
are our informants.

1282
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:04,583
We call them 'Kawktu'
in the Mizo language.

1283
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:05,916
Apart from the locals,

1284
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,791
some Army and Police Officers

1285
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:09,791
have also infiltrated the MNF.

1286
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,291
Sir, this is Officer Khuliana,

1287
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,958
from the Manipur Police's
Intelligence branch.

1288
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:20,083
He looks barely 14 or 15.

1289
01:24:20,375 --> 01:24:21,666
He's 16, Sir.

1290
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:24,708
He calls himself
Lieutenant Miram.

1291
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:26,750
He's my son.

1292
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:36,791
I am sorry, Brigadier Miram.

1293
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:38,958
No Sir...

1294
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:41,750
no one forced him
into this.

1295
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,666
It was his decision
to join them.

1296
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:49,458
Sir!

1297
01:24:49,875 --> 01:24:50,666
Sir!

1298
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,958
Please have mercy on me!

1299
01:24:58,916 --> 01:24:59,625
Sir!

1300
01:25:00,125 --> 01:25:00,791
Have mercy, please!

1301
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:06,166
Sir.

1302
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,416
He was caught returning
from an MNF camp.

1303
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:15,541
He had gone to call
his brother back home.

1304
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:22,625
Sir, he was trying to bring
his brother back home.

1305
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:28,750
Do they have reasons
to return home?

1306
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:32,958
Escort them back
to their village.

1307
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:34,166
No further action.

1308
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,000
Sir.

1309
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:37,708
Let's go!

1310
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:39,041
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

1311
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:40,500
My son!

1312
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,250
These people are in a fix.

1313
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:48,250
If they don't help the MNF,

1314
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:50,041
they're brutally harassed...

1315
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:53,750
and if they do, the Army
and Police punish them.

1316
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,291
Nurse ask him to keep quiet!
Crying like a baby!

1317
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,083
Sir...

1318
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,000
Two attack units
were deployed

1319
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:09,541
at the MNF's Vairengte base...

1320
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,333
but here the wounded soldiers
are from only one unit.

1321
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:23,916
How many bullets
did you take?

1322
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:27,125
That's it?

1323
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:28,833
Crying over one bullet?

1324
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:33,333
I had 9 Japanese bullets in me!

1325
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:34,875
But I didn't die,

1326
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,583
I became an Army Commander.

1327
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,208
You'll also become
a Subedar Major.

1328
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,291
Now stop crying.

1329
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:57,208
The second unit
is the one

1330
01:26:57,541 --> 01:26:59,458
that withdrew
without a fight.

1331
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:01,583
That's why none
of their soldiers

1332
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:03,000
lie wounded here.

1333
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:04,375
That's right, Sir.

1334
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,166
How far is the market
from here, Behroze?

1335
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,500
From the Army Commander.

1336
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:36,375
'If you can't wield guns,

1337
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
you might as well
wear bangles!'

1338
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:53,916
Charge! Charge!

1339
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:28,833
The bangles did
the trick, Sir!

1340
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:30,541
Both units together
have captured

1341
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:32,000
five insurgents in Serchhip.

1342
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,375
Tell the CO to send
the bangles back.

1343
01:28:37,958 --> 01:28:38,875
And Sir...

1344
01:28:39,208 --> 01:28:40,375
The casualties also include

1345
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:42,208
SS Lieutenant Miram.

1346
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,916
For protecting our country...

1347
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:13,583
against insurgent attacks

1348
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,166
in North-East India...

1349
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:18,000
And displaying unmatched bravery

1350
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,208
and exceptional acumen...

1351
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:23,625
Lieutenant General Sam Hormusji
Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw

1352
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:26,333
is awarded the Padma Bhushan.

1353
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:37,833
Congratulations,
Lieutenant General Manekshaw.

1354
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:39,291
Thank you, Sir.

1355
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:05,541
My dear fellow citizens,

1356
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,875
Asalam Walekum.

1357
01:30:07,166 --> 01:30:10,083
Today, I address all of you
for the last time

1358
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,291
as the President of Pakistan.

1359
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,083
This is Radio Pakistan.

1360
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:18,708
Pakistan Army Commander-in-chief,

1361
01:30:18,833 --> 01:30:19,875
General Yahya Khan

1362
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,666
shall now address the nation.

1363
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:23,833
Fellow Pakistanis...

1364
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,291
You have already heard

1365
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:29,250
Field Marshal
Mohammad Ayub Khan's speech

1366
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:31,583
which was broadcast yesterday.

1367
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,500
He called upon me

1368
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,125
to carry out my prime duty...

1369
01:30:36,708 --> 01:30:38,458
of protecting this country

1370
01:30:38,583 --> 01:30:40,541
from utter destruction.

1371
01:30:41,625 --> 01:30:43,250
As proclaimed earlier,

1372
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,500
I have imposed Martial Law

1373
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:47,041
throughout Pakistan.

1374
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,000
I urge everyone of you

1375
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:52,583
to cooperate with
my administration.

1376
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:55,750
Egg fried rice,

1377
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:58,041
tamarind and lemon candy.

1378
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:02,541
Don't try to make
sense of it, Behroze...

1379
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,958
Maja is pregnant,

1380
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,541
and these are Silloo's orders.

1381
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,041
I need to take these home.

1382
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:07,958
Sir.

1383
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:13,666
Good afternoon, Sir.

1384
01:31:13,791 --> 01:31:15,458
Connecting to
General Kumaramangalam.

1385
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,125
Good afternoon, Sir.

1386
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:35,208
Silloo!

1387
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,875
Silloo!

1388
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,041
Maja's sleeping!

1389
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:47,958
Do you know

1390
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,250
who you're about to kiss?

1391
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:52,666
I'm about to kiss someone?

1392
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:53,500
Yes...

1393
01:31:54,958 --> 01:31:56,791
Chief of Army Staff,

1394
01:31:57,125 --> 01:31:59,208
General Sam Manekshaw.

1395
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:04,458
The promotion's great...

1396
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:07,666
but what about the
size of the kitchen?

1397
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:14,958
It had to be you, Sam!

1398
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:22,083
One last question, General.

1399
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:23,791
As Army Chief,
you must have

1400
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,416
a packed schedule
in Delhi.

1401
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,666
what brings you
to Pahalgam?

1402
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,041
Is war on the anvil?

1403
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,625
Oh no, sweetie...

1404
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,333
I like meeting
my soldiers often.

1405
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:36,333
I feel alive around them.

1406
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,125
Now, is there anything else?

1407
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:40,541
No, thank you.

1408
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:41,541
Very well.

1409
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:42,708
Dippy!

1410
01:32:44,541 --> 01:32:46,166
He is Lieutenant Colonel
Depinder Singh,

1411
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,708
my Military Assistant.

1412
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:50,125
Will you please escort
the lady out, sweetie?

1413
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,625
You call everybody 'sweetie'?

1414
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:57,458
Honestly, I thought you
were flirting with me!

1415
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:02,458
Sweetie...

1416
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:04,833
had I been flirting,

1417
01:33:04,958 --> 01:33:07,625
this interview would've
gone on much longer.

1418
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:29,333
Guard...

1419
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:32,250
For Inspection... Port Arms!

1420
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:45,958
Guard...

1421
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:47,916
Ground Arms!

1422
01:34:17,583 --> 01:34:18,583
What is your name?

1423
01:34:18,833 --> 01:34:20,208
Rifleman Harka Gurung, Sir!

1424
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,666
Harka Gurung!

1425
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,083
What is my name?

1426
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:25,083
Sam...

1427
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:26,666
Mac...

1428
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:28,333
Monk...

1429
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:29,708
Sam Bahadur, Sir!

1430
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,833
Sam Bahadur.

1431
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,875
And now, international news...

1432
01:34:44,083 --> 01:34:47,291
American President
Mr Richard Nixon,

1433
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:48,916
who is currently
on a world tour,

1434
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:50,166
will soon arrive in India.

1435
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:52,291
Get ready for the spectacle, Dippy!

1436
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:54,291
May I ask you a question, Sir?

1437
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,791
Apart from my wife's
phone number

1438
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,458
and my bank account number,

1439
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:58,625
you may ask me anything!

1440
01:34:58,916 --> 01:35:00,541
Don't you miss the action, Sir?

1441
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:02,666
Being in Delhi,

1442
01:35:02,791 --> 01:35:04,000
away from your soldiers?

1443
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:05,625
We're going to Delhi, Dippy...

1444
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,416
You'll realise that

1445
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:10,291
battles aren't fought
only on the front.

1446
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:12,125
President Yahya Khan
has finally lifted

1447
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,416
Martial Law in Pakistan.

1448
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:16,083
The way General Ayub Khan
was overthrown...

1449
01:35:16,208 --> 01:35:17,500
What's new?

1450
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:21,750
Yahya Khan himself was
appointed by Ayub Khan.

1451
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:23,375
They were friends, right?

1452
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:27,000
We were friends too.

1453
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:42,416
Jai Hind, Sir.

1454
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:45,625
Lance Naik Tejinder Singh, Sir.

1455
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:47,041
You might not remember,

1456
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,166
back in 1954, my unit
was in your Brigade.

1457
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:52,666
- Lance Naik Tejinder Singh?
- Sir.

1458
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:57,666
Army Number 33 52 312.

1459
01:36:08,416 --> 01:36:10,708
Your first dinner function, Dippy?

1460
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:12,708
Ready for some lessons?

1461
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,541
You have a new name, Sir.

1462
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:19,041
'Sam Bahadur'.

1463
01:36:19,291 --> 01:36:21,541
You've been called many
names by many people, Sam.

1464
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:23,833
Often behind your back.

1465
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,541
But this name

1466
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:27,125
is my favourite.

1467
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:38,416
Is this table fine, darling?

1468
01:36:39,041 --> 01:36:40,583
I'll get you a drink.

1469
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:42,041
Dippy...

1470
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:50,916
How are you, Mr Sam?

1471
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:51,916
Fine. And you?

1472
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,875
All good! One moment...

1473
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:55,666
Oh hello...

1474
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:57,750
One whiskey,
with lukewarm water.

1475
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:58,750
So, Mr Sam...

1476
01:36:58,875 --> 01:36:59,916
One moment.

1477
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Young man!

1478
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,250
What is your name, son?

1479
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:06,458
Lieutenant Amar Sharma, Sir.

1480
01:37:06,583 --> 01:37:08,041
Lieutenant Sharma...

1481
01:37:08,833 --> 01:37:10,416
This is Defense Secretary Sarin.

1482
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:11,833
He was a bit confused

1483
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:13,750
that you're his server.

1484
01:37:14,583 --> 01:37:16,000
That's been cleared now.

1485
01:37:16,416 --> 01:37:17,500
Come, son.

1486
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:26,666
I need to meet some people,
sweetie.

1487
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,333
Will you be alright?

1488
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:29,875
I'll be OK.

1489
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:38,625
Dippy...

1490
01:37:39,541 --> 01:37:41,250
Sam told you about
some lessons, right?

1491
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:42,541
Yes, Ma'am.

1492
01:37:42,833 --> 01:37:44,541
About how all battles are...

1493
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,875
Let me give you
a lesson, too.

1494
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:49,958
How to conduct
business at a party

1495
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:51,500
where you've brought
your wife!

1496
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,500
As soon as you arrive,

1497
01:37:53,625 --> 01:37:55,708
seat your wife
at her favourite table,

1498
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,541
get her favourite drink,

1499
01:37:58,041 --> 01:37:59,416
and once she settles,

1500
01:37:59,583 --> 01:38:01,083
disappear for 10 minutes.

1501
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:02,750
Ma'am...

1502
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:04,875
Don't believe me?

1503
01:38:05,708 --> 01:38:06,708
Alright.

1504
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,625
Go to Sam, and watch.

1505
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:11,791
Ma'am.

1506
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:17,041
I believe Army Cantonments

1507
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,625
must be self-sufficient.

1508
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,500
Our soldiers deserve
a good life.

1509
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:23,083
And besides,

1510
01:38:23,541 --> 01:38:24,916
it's important to know,

1511
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:26,458
exactly who lives where!

1512
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:30,041
Absolutely.

1513
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:31,666
Ex-servicemen should have

1514
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:33,416
a minimum pension plan.

1515
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,208
It's their right.

1516
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:41,958
One day, I'll retire too.

1517
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:44,375
I must have enough money,

1518
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:47,000
to entertain my
special guests then!

1519
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:48,875
You are too charming, General!

1520
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:50,458
Thank you, sweetheart.

1521
01:38:50,583 --> 01:38:52,250
It's all thanks
to your presence!

1522
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:56,333
You are looking lovely,

1523
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:58,291
Prime Minister.

1524
01:38:58,791 --> 01:38:59,875
Thank you, Sam...

1525
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:01,083
'Bahadur'.

1526
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:05,208
You're in the news
quite a bit these days...

1527
01:39:05,291 --> 01:39:07,500
We can talk about me
another time, Prime Minister.

1528
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,458
Can we discuss
the budget now?

1529
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:10,583
Mr Sam...

1530
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,041
Is this an occasion

1531
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:13,666
to discuss the budget?

1532
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:16,750
Mr Sarin, could there be
a better occasion?

1533
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,208
The Defense Secretary,

1534
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:19,541
Defense Minister

1535
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:21,208
and the Prime Minister,
are all here...

1536
01:39:21,916 --> 01:39:23,833
I need equipment
for the Army.

1537
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,333
When I asked for
a budget hike

1538
01:39:26,458 --> 01:39:27,875
I was told that

1539
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,541
the file would have to go

1540
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,083
higher up for approval...

1541
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:34,750
I fear that by the time
the file reaches you,

1542
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:36,500
I would have retired.

1543
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:40,041
I'll look into it.

1544
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:41,166
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1545
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:42,750
I'll take your leave now.

1546
01:39:47,083 --> 01:39:48,250
Didn't I tell you, Dippy...

1547
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:50,625
Battles aren't just
fought on the front!

1548
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:52,083
Correct, Sir.

1549
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:53,791
I learnt a lot today.

1550
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:56,916
But the most important
lesson I learnt today:

1551
01:39:57,666 --> 01:39:59,875
No matter how many wars
a man wins,

1552
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:02,500
he's no match for
a woman's mind!

1553
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:10,250
Hello, Sir.

1554
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:12,458
Sir, he wanted to meet you.

1555
01:40:13,458 --> 01:40:14,833
I've heard a lot about you.

1556
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:20,875
Dippy, schedule a meeting
over tea?

1557
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:29,208
Sam!

1558
01:40:29,458 --> 01:40:30,000
Yes.

1559
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:31,000
Phone.

1560
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:32,416
Who is it?

1561
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:35,083
Who else!

1562
01:40:36,125 --> 01:40:36,833
Who?

1563
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,291
Stay.

1564
01:40:51,666 --> 01:40:54,000
Is everything alright,
Prime Minister?

1565
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,833
Is there a problem?

1566
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:00,333
Problems are many, Sam.

1567
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:04,625
Well, you always have

1568
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:06,666
this shoulder to cry on...

1569
01:41:08,041 --> 01:41:09,458
And what if I tell you

1570
01:41:09,666 --> 01:41:11,833
that you are my problem?

1571
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:13,333
Me?

1572
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:15,291
What have I done?

1573
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,250
You haven't done
anything yet...

1574
01:41:17,541 --> 01:41:19,583
But do you intend to?

1575
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:21,666
As in?

1576
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:24,291
As in, a Coup...

1577
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:25,625
Martial Law?

1578
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:28,083
Like what's happening
around us...

1579
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:31,625
What do you think?

1580
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:34,541
You can't.

1581
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,333
I can't,

1582
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:37,875
or I won't?

1583
01:41:39,083 --> 01:41:41,541
There's a difference in
capability and intent,

1584
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,916
Prime Minister.

1585
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:47,166
I have no interest
in politics.

1586
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:49,916
The Army is my life.

1587
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:03,333
There's a nursery rhyme:

1588
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,375
'You mind your own business,

1589
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:07,958
I'll mind mine.

1590
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:10,333
You kiss your own sweetheart,

1591
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:11,875
I'll kiss mine.'

1592
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:17,333
Prime Minister.

1593
01:42:18,166 --> 01:42:18,958
Sam...

1594
01:42:20,916 --> 01:42:22,416
I'm sure you understand

1595
01:42:22,666 --> 01:42:24,208
why I was worried.

1596
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:31,875
Despite the landslide win
of the Awami League

1597
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,166
and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,

1598
01:42:33,416 --> 01:42:34,583
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

1599
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:37,208
has boycotted the Assembly.

1600
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:39,416
If you want to give

1601
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:41,500
equal rights as a Pakistani

1602
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:44,458
then you have to give Bengal

1603
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:45,750
their right to live...

1604
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:47,541
because they have been exploited

1605
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:50,416
for a long, long 23 years...

1606
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:52,875
It cannot be
tolerated anymore.

1607
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,041
There seems to be
no end in sight

1608
01:42:55,125 --> 01:42:56,958
for Pakistan's political woes.

1609
01:42:57,125 --> 01:42:58,541
Let me warn you

1610
01:42:58,666 --> 01:42:59,791
and I warn the world

1611
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:01,125
that this will mean war!

1612
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:03,458
I'm saying it clearly!

1613
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:06,208
This time, the fight

1614
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:09,041
is for our liberation!

1615
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:11,083
This time, the fight

1616
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:13,250
is for our Independence!

1617
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,416
Remember!

1618
01:43:15,541 --> 01:43:17,125
I have given my blood.

1619
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:18,791
And I will give
my blood again.

1620
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:22,000
I will liberate the people
of my country!

1621
01:43:35,458 --> 01:43:36,416
Tonight.

1622
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,708
Your country, my country...

1623
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:49,750
Bangladesh! Bangladesh!

1624
01:43:49,875 --> 01:43:51,708
Brave Bengalis take to arms...

1625
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:53,541
Liberate Bangladesh!

1626
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:55,583
Brave Bengalis take to arms...

1627
01:43:55,666 --> 01:43:57,375
Liberate Bangladesh!

1628
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:59,208
Free it! Liberate it!

1629
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:00,708
Liberate Bangladesh!

1630
01:46:10,916 --> 01:46:12,250
Please! Please!

1631
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,833
The Butcher.

1632
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:36,958
Tikka was known as
'The Butcher' in IMA.

1633
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:40,000
In '69, after brutally crushing

1634
01:46:40,125 --> 01:46:42,625
the Balochi movement,
he became

1635
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:44,958
'The Butcher of Balochistan'.

1636
01:46:46,083 --> 01:46:49,291
And now, after the operation
at Dacca University,

1637
01:46:49,375 --> 01:46:52,208
I guess he's become
'The Butcher of Bengal'.

1638
01:46:53,083 --> 01:46:54,333
This butcher

1639
01:46:54,583 --> 01:46:57,041
has murdered hundreds
of people, Sam...

1640
01:46:57,875 --> 01:46:59,375
Do you know what
he's been doing

1641
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:00,666
in East Pakistan?

1642
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:03,916
His soldiers are making people

1643
01:47:04,041 --> 01:47:06,166
dig their own graves
before killing them.

1644
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:09,208
3 million refugees

1645
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:12,250
have entered India from
East Pakistan till now.

1646
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:17,541
Bengal, Assam and Tripura...

1647
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:20,083
I'm getting telegrams from
Chief Ministers of every state.

1648
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:24,208
You will have to enter
East Pakistan, Sam.

1649
01:47:27,791 --> 01:47:30,291
That would mean war...

1650
01:47:32,375 --> 01:47:33,708
Then so be it.

1651
01:47:35,041 --> 01:47:37,208
Are you ready for war?

1652
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:39,708
Because I am not.

1653
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,250
Please agree, Mr Shyam.

1654
01:47:51,291 --> 01:47:52,958
April is coming to an end.

1655
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:56,375
The snow will start melting
in the Himalayan passes

1656
01:47:56,541 --> 01:47:59,083
and open the way
for the Chinese forces.

1657
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:02,208
In East Pakistan, the Monsoon
is about to arrive.

1658
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:03,458
With snow melting above

1659
01:48:03,583 --> 01:48:04,833
and the rains below,

1660
01:48:05,083 --> 01:48:06,541
the movement of our forces

1661
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:07,458
will be restricted

1662
01:48:07,583 --> 01:48:09,666
and they won't get
Air support either.

1663
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,041
The result will be the same

1664
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:14,791
as it was in 1962,
Defense Minister.

1665
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:17,000
You may not have a problem

1666
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:19,250
with being in such a position,

1667
01:48:19,375 --> 01:48:21,083
but I certainly do.

1668
01:48:23,583 --> 01:48:25,416
I don't want to lose.

1669
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:31,291
But we'll do as you say,

1670
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:32,708
Prime Minister...

1671
01:48:34,583 --> 01:48:36,291
Now give me your orders.

1672
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:44,875
Let's reassemble at 4.

1673
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:54,083
Chief...

1674
01:48:55,083 --> 01:48:56,458
Please stay back.

1675
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:01,416
Prime Minister, before
you say anything further,

1676
01:49:01,541 --> 01:49:03,166
I have a question for you:

1677
01:49:03,916 --> 01:49:05,708
Shall I hand in my
resignation now,

1678
01:49:05,833 --> 01:49:07,208
or tomorrow morning?

1679
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:09,916
What you just told us,

1680
01:49:10,208 --> 01:49:11,166
is it true?

1681
01:49:11,291 --> 01:49:13,750
Telling you the truth
is my duty.

1682
01:49:15,083 --> 01:49:17,416
Fighting wars is my job,
Prime Minister...

1683
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,458
And I fight to win.

1684
01:49:24,875 --> 01:49:26,208
Prepare for war.

1685
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:28,708
Only preparation...

1686
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:30,166
No immediate action.

1687
01:49:44,416 --> 01:49:46,458
The war will begin
on this day.

1688
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:49,916
Whether we start it,

1689
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,125
or them.

1690
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:59,000
The refugees pose
a human problem

1691
01:49:59,791 --> 01:50:01,333
and it has to be settled

1692
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,791
on that basis.

1693
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:05,708
At the same time,

1694
01:50:10,208 --> 01:50:12,416
the problem of our
relations with India

1695
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:14,333
is a major factor.

1696
01:50:19,416 --> 01:50:21,458
Any initiative, Mr. President,

1697
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:25,166
that you might find
possible to take

1698
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,583
in solving the problem

1699
01:50:27,708 --> 01:50:29,416
and other related issues

1700
01:50:30,333 --> 01:50:31,916
would be an act of

1701
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:34,500
historical significance.

1702
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:38,375
Send it to President Nixon.

1703
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:53,291
The phone, again.

1704
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:55,083
Must be her again.

1705
01:51:02,208 --> 01:51:03,291
What are you doing, Sam?

1706
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,416
Breakfast, Prime Minister.

1707
01:51:08,791 --> 01:51:11,000
Have breakfast with me today...

1708
01:51:12,208 --> 01:51:13,125
By the way...

1709
01:51:13,291 --> 01:51:14,125
What are you wearing?

1710
01:51:15,291 --> 01:51:16,875
I beg your pardon,
Prime Minister?

1711
01:51:19,625 --> 01:51:21,291
In full uniform, now!

1712
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:23,000
Prime Minister.

1713
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:30,583
Mr Kissinger,

1714
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:32,291
Ambassador Keating...

1715
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:34,375
General Manekshaw.

1716
01:51:37,041 --> 01:51:38,583
President Nixon has
received a letter

1717
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:39,833
from President Yahya Khan

1718
01:51:39,958 --> 01:51:42,458
that makes his intent
very clear

1719
01:51:42,916 --> 01:51:44,291
about East Pakistan.

1720
01:51:45,083 --> 01:51:46,750
You know Mr Kissinger,

1721
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:49,666
there is this boy
in Rajiv's class,

1722
01:51:50,291 --> 01:51:52,208
who thinks it is
his business

1723
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:53,375
to stick his nose

1724
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,291
into everyone else's business.

1725
01:51:56,708 --> 01:51:58,125
But instead of going around

1726
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:59,625
asking for help,

1727
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,375
I told Rajiv

1728
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,541
to sort it out directly
with the bully.

1729
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:06,791
Please ask President Nixon

1730
01:52:06,916 --> 01:52:08,875
to restrain the powers
in Pakistan

1731
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,333
with regard to this matter.

1732
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:12,833
I am sorry, Madam...

1733
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:14,583
but neither President Nixon

1734
01:52:14,708 --> 01:52:16,166
nor I can do anything
in this matter.

1735
01:52:17,083 --> 01:52:18,541
This is a ridiculous situation.

1736
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,208
You can't go to war

1737
01:52:22,333 --> 01:52:23,541
over a few refugees.

1738
01:52:24,083 --> 01:52:25,875
The number is 7 million,

1739
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,375
Mr Kissinger.

1740
01:52:27,583 --> 01:52:30,083
I know this is a tough situation,
Mrs Gandhi....

1741
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:33,083
but the global repercussions

1742
01:52:33,416 --> 01:52:34,916
of any hostile action

1743
01:52:35,458 --> 01:52:36,708
taken by India,

1744
01:52:37,458 --> 01:52:38,500
will be...

1745
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:41,375
tremendous.

1746
01:52:47,125 --> 01:52:48,583
What do you plan to do?

1747
01:52:48,791 --> 01:52:50,333
I have no other option...

1748
01:52:52,833 --> 01:52:54,375
I will turn to
General Manekshaw.

1749
01:52:57,708 --> 01:52:58,875
I would suggest

1750
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:00,958
that you insist
upon Pakistan

1751
01:53:01,291 --> 01:53:02,625
to make conditions right

1752
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:04,625
for those 7 million refugees

1753
01:53:05,458 --> 01:53:07,083
to go back
to their country.

1754
01:53:08,416 --> 01:53:09,625
If you don't...

1755
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:12,583
He will.

1756
01:53:30,458 --> 01:53:32,166
Well played, Prime Minister.

1757
01:53:34,916 --> 01:53:36,750
"Our borders beckon"

1758
01:53:37,458 --> 01:53:39,375
"From the frontiers"

1759
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:41,833
"we will call"

1760
01:53:42,125 --> 01:53:44,708
"Hail Mother India!"

1761
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,166
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1762
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:47,791
"the glory of my country..."

1763
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:50,250
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1764
01:54:00,041 --> 01:54:01,250
"Our borders beckon"

1765
01:54:01,375 --> 01:54:02,458
"From the frontiers"

1766
01:54:02,583 --> 01:54:03,791
"we will call"

1767
01:54:04,125 --> 01:54:05,125
Doing well, Kalkat!

1768
01:54:05,375 --> 01:54:06,208
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1769
01:54:06,333 --> 01:54:07,416
"the glory of my country..."

1770
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:09,583
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1771
01:54:20,083 --> 01:54:23,666
"We soar like the rising sun"

1772
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:28,708
"Crumble mountains
in our wake"

1773
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,375
"In our beating hearts"

1774
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:34,791
"a storm rages away..."

1775
01:54:35,041 --> 01:54:37,458
"There's a fervour in our frenzy...
We conquer the fray!"

1776
01:54:37,583 --> 01:54:38,958
- Jai Hind, Sir!
- Jai Hind!

1777
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:42,833
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1778
01:54:45,041 --> 01:54:47,375
"Stop for none,
submit to none"

1779
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,083
"We march on!"

1780
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:53,500
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1781
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:56,541
"Together as one..."

1782
01:54:56,666 --> 01:54:59,041
"United, we march on!"

1783
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:02,541
Always remember,
we're soldiers...

1784
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:04,291
Not thieves.

1785
01:55:04,958 --> 01:55:07,375
During war,
eye only the enemy.

1786
01:55:07,625 --> 01:55:09,833
Not anyone's money
or belongings!

1787
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:17,458
I am the son of Garuda,
say O my friend!

1788
01:55:17,875 --> 01:55:19,583
Sacrifice Supreme Duty!

1789
01:55:20,333 --> 01:55:22,583
The Jat is strong!
Victory to God!

1790
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:24,833
Ever powerful!

1791
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:27,125
Hail Goddess Kali!

1792
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,291
Here come the Gorkhas!

1793
01:55:30,083 --> 01:55:33,750
"With raging rivers we flow"

1794
01:55:35,041 --> 01:55:38,708
"Ever watchful in our way"

1795
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:42,333
"The will is unbendable"

1796
01:55:42,541 --> 01:55:44,500
"Every duty is obeyed"

1797
01:55:45,083 --> 01:55:48,291
"There's a fervour in our frenzy...
We conquer the fray!"

1798
01:55:49,041 --> 01:55:50,208
Rhino Charge!

1799
01:55:50,666 --> 01:55:52,916
The Battalions need equipment, Chief.

1800
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:54,916
It's time for Air support.

1801
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,375
"Stop for none,
submit to none"

1802
01:55:57,500 --> 01:55:59,250
"We march on!"

1803
01:56:00,291 --> 01:56:01,833
No soldier of mine

1804
01:56:02,125 --> 01:56:04,208
will ever touch a woman.

1805
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,166
Before soldiers,
we're gentlemen...

1806
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:10,000
When you see a Begum,

1807
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:12,166
put your hands
in your pockets,

1808
01:56:12,875 --> 01:56:14,333
and think about Sam!

1809
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:17,041
Brave Madrasi!

1810
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:19,583
Hit and kill!

1811
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,958
Say victory to King Shivaji Maharaj!

1812
01:56:29,708 --> 01:56:32,166
Victory to the Great Lord Badri Nath!

1813
01:56:32,541 --> 01:56:34,833
Victory to Birsa Munda!

1814
01:56:35,041 --> 01:56:37,250
Victory to Lord Hanuman!

1815
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:39,750
Victory to King Ramachandra!

1816
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:42,041
Say victory to India!

1817
01:56:42,916 --> 01:56:45,125
He who says 'God is truth'...

1818
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:47,041
Is ever blessed!

1819
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:49,291
Blackout drills will begin soon.

1820
01:56:49,416 --> 01:56:51,083
Our radars too,
are operational now.

1821
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:52,791
I can assure complete
Air superiority

1822
01:56:52,916 --> 01:56:54,708
over East Pakistan
in a few days.

1823
01:56:55,333 --> 01:56:58,083
Our Western and Eastern fleets
are absolutely ready.

1824
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,541
We'll target Karachi
in the West,

1825
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:02,708
and the Eastern fleet
along with INS Vikrant

1826
01:57:02,833 --> 01:57:05,500
will make the East Pakistan
seaboard in-operational.

1827
01:57:06,291 --> 01:57:07,458
"Our borders beckon"

1828
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:08,833
"From the frontiers"

1829
01:57:08,916 --> 01:57:10,875
"we will call"

1830
01:57:11,208 --> 01:57:13,041
Intelligence reports
are up to date.

1831
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:15,041
Our network is
stronger than before.

1832
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:17,416
"Our borders beckon"

1833
01:57:17,541 --> 01:57:18,708
"From the frontiers"

1834
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:20,583
"we will call"

1835
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:22,333
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1836
01:57:22,458 --> 01:57:23,958
"the glory of my country..."

1837
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:26,041
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1838
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:28,416
Victory to Goddess Kali!

1839
01:57:28,833 --> 01:57:30,833
Victory to Goddess Jwala!

1840
01:57:31,208 --> 01:57:33,125
Victory to Goddess Durga!

1841
01:57:33,791 --> 01:57:35,958
Victory to Mother India!

1842
01:57:36,333 --> 01:57:39,791
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1843
01:57:41,291 --> 01:57:43,541
"Stop for none,
submit to none"

1844
01:57:43,791 --> 01:57:45,333
"We march on!"

1845
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:48,625
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1846
01:57:51,291 --> 01:57:52,625
"Together as one..."

1847
01:57:52,750 --> 01:57:54,625
"United, we march on!"

1848
01:57:56,250 --> 01:57:59,541
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1849
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:03,625
"Stop for none,
submit to none"

1850
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:04,833
"We march on!"

1851
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:08,458
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on!"

1852
01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:11,250
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on!"

1853
01:58:30,666 --> 01:58:31,583
Today...

1854
01:58:33,125 --> 01:58:35,375
I've come here
to meet all of you...

1855
01:58:37,458 --> 01:58:39,833
To salute all of you.

1856
01:58:43,041 --> 01:58:44,458
At the end of the war,

1857
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:47,708
some of you

1858
01:58:48,666 --> 01:58:49,833
may not be here...

1859
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:55,041
Whether we survive
or we perish...

1860
01:58:57,208 --> 01:58:58,958
the pride of our uniform

1861
01:58:59,041 --> 01:59:00,750
shall live on forever!

1862
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:07,708
This refugee situation

1863
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:09,041
is out of control.

1864
01:59:09,583 --> 01:59:11,000
But we shouldn't
be the ones

1865
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:12,125
to start the war.

1866
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,625
We won't have to.

1867
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,333
I know Yahya well.

1868
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,416
He reacts with emotion,

1869
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:19,791
not intellect.

1870
01:59:20,583 --> 01:59:21,750
Prime Minister.

1871
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:30,541
Are you ready for this, Sam?

1872
01:59:31,708 --> 01:59:33,416
I'm always ready, sweetie.

1873
01:59:40,583 --> 01:59:42,125
Our enemy

1874
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:45,875
has provoked us
yet again.

1875
01:59:47,583 --> 01:59:49,458
We've tolerated enough.

1876
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:51,791
Now,

1877
01:59:52,458 --> 01:59:54,458
the time has come

1878
01:59:55,208 --> 01:59:56,958
to give the enemy

1879
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,333
a crushing response.

1880
02:00:36,625 --> 02:00:38,833
Pakistan has attacked
our Airfields!

1881
02:00:43,333 --> 02:00:44,208
Tell me.

1882
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:45,333
Amritsar...

1883
02:00:46,333 --> 02:00:47,458
Pathankot...

1884
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Avantipur...

1885
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:50,166
Srinagar...

1886
02:00:50,791 --> 02:00:51,750
Uttarlai...

1887
02:00:52,458 --> 02:00:53,375
Ambala...

1888
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,166
Jodhpur...

1889
02:00:55,583 --> 02:00:56,666
and Agra.

1890
02:00:59,333 --> 02:01:01,166
This is the day we've
been preparing for.

1891
02:01:01,333 --> 02:01:03,291
Gentlemen, let's get them.

1892
02:01:08,583 --> 02:01:09,458
What happened?

1893
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:10,500
Are you OK?

1894
02:01:10,625 --> 02:01:11,375
No...

1895
02:01:11,916 --> 02:01:12,791
Actually...

1896
02:01:13,250 --> 02:01:14,875
I came running, so...

1897
02:01:15,958 --> 02:01:17,041
Why running?

1898
02:01:17,625 --> 02:01:19,666
Because General Candeth
had to call me.

1899
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,375
You all prepared fully
for the war...

1900
02:01:24,166 --> 02:01:25,625
but no one remembered

1901
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:27,166
to put a phone
in this room!

1902
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:38,958
The people of East Bengal

1903
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,125
are sacrificing their blood

1904
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:43,333
for their freedom.

1905
02:01:44,291 --> 02:01:45,958
At this difficult hour,

1906
02:01:46,333 --> 02:01:48,750
all citizens of our country

1907
02:01:49,208 --> 02:01:52,791
must stand united
to face all hardships

1908
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:56,583
and dangers ahead of us.

1909
02:01:58,041 --> 02:02:00,875
India stands in
complete solidarity

1910
02:02:01,375 --> 02:02:04,416
with our Bengali
sisters and brothers.

1911
02:02:04,916 --> 02:02:08,250
We salute their
immense courage!

1912
02:02:08,750 --> 02:02:10,500
Joy Bangla!

1913
02:02:10,666 --> 02:02:12,208
Joy Bangla!

1914
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:13,916
Joy Bangabandhu!

1915
02:02:14,041 --> 02:02:16,000
Joy Bangabandhu!

1916
02:02:16,208 --> 02:02:17,958
And remember!
Pakistan must never

1917
02:02:18,083 --> 02:02:19,416
forget this war!

1918
02:02:20,291 --> 02:02:22,500
Also get me the Eastern and
Western Army Commanders

1919
02:02:22,625 --> 02:02:24,291
on the line immediately.

1920
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:28,000
Sir, Admiral Nanda
and Air Chief Lal

1921
02:02:28,125 --> 02:02:29,208
shall meet you
in half an hour.

1922
02:02:29,333 --> 02:02:30,500
Is that alright?

1923
02:02:34,583 --> 02:02:35,375
Sir?

1924
02:02:35,625 --> 02:02:36,416
Yes?

1925
02:02:36,791 --> 02:02:37,583
Yes.

1926
02:02:40,541 --> 02:02:41,958
Sam was right.

1927
02:02:43,333 --> 02:02:45,125
Yahya will not be
able to resist.

1928
02:02:55,541 --> 02:02:57,375
Madam, may I ask you
something?

1929
02:02:58,166 --> 02:02:59,625
In the middle
of your speech,

1930
02:02:59,708 --> 02:03:01,250
you got news of
Pakistan's attack.

1931
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,958
But your face didn't
as much as twitch.

1932
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:07,916
And you're smiling
even now.

1933
02:03:23,375 --> 02:03:25,041
Sam had written down...

1934
02:03:27,083 --> 02:03:28,250
when the war will begin.

1935
02:03:33,041 --> 02:03:33,958
Tonight.

1936
02:03:39,041 --> 02:03:40,166
"Our borders beckon"

1937
02:03:40,291 --> 02:03:41,458
"From the frontiers"

1938
02:03:41,583 --> 02:03:43,541
"we will call"

1939
02:03:44,041 --> 02:03:45,208
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1940
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:46,416
"the glory of my country..."

1941
02:03:46,541 --> 02:03:47,541
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1942
02:03:47,666 --> 02:03:50,333
In the Eastern sector
all three Indian Armed Forces

1943
02:03:50,458 --> 02:03:51,708
along with the Mukti Bahini

1944
02:03:51,833 --> 02:03:53,958
launched attacks on
Sylhet and Chittagong.

1945
02:03:56,875 --> 02:03:58,875
In the Western region,
the Indian Air Force

1946
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,541
bombed 13 Pakistani airfields.

1947
02:04:04,833 --> 02:04:08,791
Battles continue in Uri, Poonch,
Shakkargarh and Chhamb.

1948
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:15,666
Our troops are under pressure

1949
02:04:15,791 --> 02:04:17,041
in Chhamb, Pratap.

1950
02:04:17,583 --> 02:04:18,791
We need to divert

1951
02:04:18,916 --> 02:04:20,875
Air resources for
ground support.

1952
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:22,958
But our Air Force is busy

1953
02:04:23,083 --> 02:04:24,708
attacking Pakistani airfields.

1954
02:04:24,958 --> 02:04:27,208
I've already diverted
Air support, there Sam!

1955
02:04:27,916 --> 02:04:28,916
For heaven's sake,

1956
02:04:29,041 --> 02:04:30,458
leave the Air battle to me!

1957
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:33,958
It's crucial that we damage
Pakistani airfields,

1958
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:35,791
or their aircrafts will continue

1959
02:04:35,916 --> 02:04:37,083
to attack your troops!

1960
02:04:47,291 --> 02:04:49,125
In Sylhet, the Indian Army

1961
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,583
defeated the Pakistani forces,

1962
02:04:51,708 --> 02:04:54,166
deploying a Helicopter
attack for the first time.

1963
02:04:54,708 --> 02:04:56,125
Pakistan has sunk

1964
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:58,208
the Indian warship,
INS Khukri.

1965
02:04:58,583 --> 02:05:00,875
The bombing of Chittagong port

1966
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,916
by the Indian Air Force
along with INS Vikrant

1967
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:04,416
has enforced an
effective blockade

1968
02:05:04,541 --> 02:05:05,750
in the Bay of Bengal.

1969
02:05:07,125 --> 02:05:08,666
We lost INS Khukri

1970
02:05:08,750 --> 02:05:09,875
35 nautical miles

1971
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
south-west of Diu Head,
Prime Minister.

1972
02:05:12,416 --> 02:05:14,583
But with the Navy's
second missile strike,

1973
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:16,833
Karachi port is still
inoperational.

1974
02:05:17,125 --> 02:05:18,416
And in Longewala,

1975
02:05:18,708 --> 02:05:19,875
after the joint actions

1976
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,041
of the Air Force and Army

1977
02:05:21,166 --> 02:05:22,333
12 Infantry Division

1978
02:05:22,458 --> 02:05:23,375
has cleared the enemy

1979
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,750
from Jaisalmer sector.

1980
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:29,041
Give me an updated report
at 5, Chief.

1981
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:30,291
Prime Minister.

1982
02:05:31,541 --> 02:05:33,375
What's new in this report?

1983
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:37,000
More stories of our defeat?

1984
02:05:43,833 --> 02:05:45,125
"Our borders beckon"

1985
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,291
"From the frontiers"

1986
02:05:46,416 --> 02:05:48,000
"we will call"

1987
02:05:48,916 --> 02:05:50,083
"On the forehead is inscribed"

1988
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:51,333
"the glory of my country..."

1989
02:05:51,416 --> 02:05:53,375
"It is my mark, my pride!"

1990
02:05:57,500 --> 02:05:59,583
By sea, by air
and on land...

1991
02:05:59,708 --> 02:06:02,166
From all sides,
the Indian Forces

1992
02:06:02,291 --> 02:06:03,750
are now closing in
on Dhaka.

1993
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:07,541
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1994
02:06:08,875 --> 02:06:10,333
"Together as one..."

1995
02:06:10,458 --> 02:06:12,250
"United, we march on!"

1996
02:06:13,916 --> 02:06:16,416
"Onwards and upwards,
we march on"

1997
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:21,250
"Stop for none,
submit to none"

1998
02:06:21,375 --> 02:06:23,166
"We march on!"

1999
02:06:23,916 --> 02:06:25,458
"We march on!"

2000
02:06:38,625 --> 02:06:40,333
The people of this area

2001
02:06:41,083 --> 02:06:42,500
are against you.

2002
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,041
They hate you.

2003
02:06:47,875 --> 02:06:50,500
The Indian Army
has surrounded you.

2004
02:06:51,708 --> 02:06:53,416
The Indian Navy

2005
02:06:53,916 --> 02:06:56,250
has shut down your ports.

2006
02:06:57,083 --> 02:06:59,750
Your Air Force has
been destroyed

2007
02:06:59,833 --> 02:07:01,291
in East Pakistan.

2008
02:07:02,083 --> 02:07:04,583
The Mukti Bahini
and people of Bengal

2009
02:07:04,791 --> 02:07:06,208
are ready to take revenge

2010
02:07:06,333 --> 02:07:08,000
for your crimes.

2011
02:07:09,416 --> 02:07:11,458
Why do you want to
waste your lives?

2012
02:07:11,708 --> 02:07:14,125
Don't you want
to return home,

2013
02:07:14,416 --> 02:07:17,333
to your family,
to your children?

2014
02:07:17,958 --> 02:07:19,583
Don't waste any more time.

2015
02:07:19,916 --> 02:07:22,333
There's no shame
in putting down arms

2016
02:07:22,458 --> 02:07:24,250
in front of a fellow soldier.

2017
02:07:27,875 --> 02:07:29,875
This is the Indian Army's promise:

2018
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:31,958
You will be accorded

2019
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:34,083
the respect

2020
02:07:35,208 --> 02:07:36,708
that befits a soldier.

2021
02:07:39,083 --> 02:07:40,833
This is the Indian Army's promise:

2022
02:07:41,083 --> 02:07:42,500
You will be accorded

2023
02:07:42,833 --> 02:07:44,208
the respect

2024
02:07:44,583 --> 02:07:46,166
that befits a soldier.

2025
02:07:48,916 --> 02:07:50,875
Pakistan has transmitted

2026
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,208
a surrender proposal, gentlemen!

2027
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,125
Victory to Mother India!

2028
02:08:11,958 --> 02:08:13,916
The Indian Army's
onslaught continues

2029
02:08:14,041 --> 02:08:15,125
on the Western front.

2030
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,583
On the Eastern front,

2031
02:08:16,708 --> 02:08:19,500
Pakistan's defeat
seems certain.

2032
02:08:24,916 --> 02:08:27,166
So what if the whole of
East Pakistan falls?

2033
02:08:27,416 --> 02:08:28,833
In the UN Security
Council meeting

2034
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:30,625
held at Pakistan's request,

2035
02:08:30,750 --> 02:08:33,750
Pakistan's Foreign Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto

2036
02:08:33,916 --> 02:08:36,375
put forth his stance
on the issue of ceasefire.

2037
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:37,291
We will fight.

2038
02:08:37,416 --> 02:08:38,375
We will go back and fight.

2039
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:40,875
I will not be a party

2040
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,750
to the ignominious surrender
of a part of my country.

2041
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,500
You can take your
Security Council!

2042
02:08:45,625 --> 02:08:47,208
Here you are!
I am going!

2043
02:08:53,708 --> 02:08:55,125
I don't agree, Prime Minister.

2044
02:08:57,041 --> 02:08:59,291
It was wrong of us
to put the Indian Army

2045
02:08:59,416 --> 02:09:01,708
in a defensive position
on the Western front.

2046
02:09:02,041 --> 02:09:03,708
Now to suddenly
halt action there,

2047
02:09:03,833 --> 02:09:05,541
without giving our forces
a proper chance...

2048
02:09:05,666 --> 02:09:08,041
This is just unfair,
Prime Minister.

2049
02:09:10,916 --> 02:09:12,083
It has to be done, Sam.

2050
02:09:14,041 --> 02:09:15,041
Go to Dhaka tomorrow

2051
02:09:15,166 --> 02:09:16,583
and collect the surrender papers.

2052
02:09:18,666 --> 02:09:20,166
Aurora should go.

2053
02:09:21,458 --> 02:09:22,500
Are you sure?

2054
02:10:04,125 --> 02:10:05,958
All the world admires

2055
02:10:06,750 --> 02:10:08,708
a deed, well done.

2056
02:10:09,458 --> 02:10:10,625
And I think,

2057
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,583
with all modesty

2058
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:13,958
we can say

2059
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:15,333
that we have done

2060
02:10:15,541 --> 02:10:16,625
this action

2061
02:10:17,041 --> 02:10:17,833
well!

2062
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:55,708
And Madam wants
this gentleman

2063
02:10:55,833 --> 02:10:56,958
to become the Field Marshal!

2064
02:10:57,125 --> 02:10:59,041
India will never have

2065
02:10:59,166 --> 02:11:01,166
the post of Field Marshal.

2066
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,416
I sent a proposal to
make you Field Marshal...

2067
02:11:08,208 --> 02:11:10,000
And you go and do this?

2068
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:12,666
'Pakistan would've won the war

2069
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:14,750
if I was their Army Chief.'

2070
02:11:15,583 --> 02:11:17,083
Really, Chief?

2071
02:11:17,875 --> 02:11:19,125
It was a joke.

2072
02:11:20,208 --> 02:11:21,708
I also said that

2073
02:11:21,833 --> 02:11:24,500
Yahya didn't pay me
for my bike,

2074
02:11:24,916 --> 02:11:27,250
so I took half
his country away.

2075
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,375
London is my favourite
city in Europe...

2076
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,958
They forgot to write 'Europe'.

2077
02:11:39,541 --> 02:11:42,666
You know me, Prime Minister.

2078
02:11:45,833 --> 02:11:47,458
We soldiers can fight enemies

2079
02:11:47,583 --> 02:11:49,250
from outside the country,

2080
02:11:49,541 --> 02:11:51,500
we can defend ourselves.

2081
02:11:52,333 --> 02:11:54,583
But not with those
within our country...

2082
02:11:56,625 --> 02:11:59,583
Here, it's your duty

2083
02:12:00,583 --> 02:12:02,000
to fight for us,

2084
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:03,833
Madam Prime Minister.

2085
02:12:30,625 --> 02:12:31,500
Sam...

2086
02:12:32,541 --> 02:12:33,583
Retirement?

2087
02:13:07,791 --> 02:13:08,708
Oh yes,

2088
02:13:08,833 --> 02:13:10,791
I am both delighted
and proud

2089
02:13:10,916 --> 02:13:12,625
to be promoted
as Field Marshal.

2090
02:13:13,041 --> 02:13:14,333
Happy and honoured!

2091
02:13:16,208 --> 02:13:17,541
Will that be all?

2092
02:13:18,958 --> 02:13:20,166
Just a few photos, Sir.

2093
02:13:20,291 --> 02:13:22,583
But... I'm not even ready!

2094
02:13:23,375 --> 02:13:25,291
You look beautiful, Silloo.

2095
02:13:25,583 --> 02:13:26,666
Always.

2096
02:13:30,291 --> 02:13:32,166
Any special plans tonight,
Field Marshal?

2097
02:13:32,625 --> 02:13:34,000
It's New Year's Eve.

2098
02:13:34,750 --> 02:13:37,041
Tonight, my wife and I...

2099
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:38,958
we will go places.

2100
02:13:40,708 --> 02:13:42,833
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Field Marshal.

2101
02:13:48,208 --> 02:13:50,416
Great timing for your promotion...

2102
02:13:51,416 --> 02:13:53,541
Just 15 days before retirement!

2103
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,375
"Doesn't slow down"

2104
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:07,541
"Nor turns around"

2105
02:14:08,166 --> 02:14:10,583
"Just keeps going on..."

2106
02:14:11,958 --> 02:14:15,583
"Not much is heard or said"

2107
02:14:16,416 --> 02:14:19,041
"He believes in soldiering on"

2108
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:23,875
"History will forever wonder..."

2109
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:26,541
"What a man he is!"

2110
02:14:28,041 --> 02:14:30,416
"He is God's chosen one..."

2111
02:14:32,125 --> 02:14:34,416
"He is our special one!"

2112
02:14:36,291 --> 02:14:38,833
"He is God's chosen one..."

2113
02:14:40,333 --> 02:14:42,541
"He is our special one!"

2114
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:56,583
"Every crease on his forehead..."

2115
02:14:57,541 --> 02:14:59,666
"A mark of his destiny"

2116
02:15:01,666 --> 02:15:04,541
"Every word spoken..."

2117
02:15:05,583 --> 02:15:08,083
"Is etched in eternity"

2118
02:15:09,875 --> 02:15:13,250
"History will forever wonder..."

2119
02:15:13,708 --> 02:15:16,125
"What a man he is!"

2120
02:15:17,375 --> 02:15:20,208
"He is God's chosen one..."

2121
02:15:21,541 --> 02:15:24,083
"He is our special one!"

2122
02:15:25,666 --> 02:15:28,458
"He is God's chosen one..."

2123
02:15:29,791 --> 02:15:32,458
"He is our special one!"

2124
02:15:35,541 --> 02:15:36,583
Sir...

2125
02:15:37,166 --> 02:15:39,291
You won't be on duty
from tomorrow...

2126
02:15:39,541 --> 02:15:40,541
It will seem very strange.

2127
02:15:41,708 --> 02:15:43,666
Don't you worry, sweetie...

2128
02:15:44,166 --> 02:15:46,541
A Field Marshal is
always on duty!

2129
02:15:50,958 --> 02:15:54,250
"Life's ups and downs"

2130
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:57,666
"Each moment lived
with passion"

2131
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:02,666
"This fierce and fearless soldier"

2132
02:16:03,125 --> 02:16:05,916
"Dedicated to his nation!"

2133
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:12,833
"There will never be another"

2134
02:16:13,541 --> 02:16:16,250
"Like this wondrous one!"

2135
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:19,916
"He is God's chosen one..."

2136
02:16:21,166 --> 02:16:23,666
"He is our special one!"
