00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,500
[Archie] <i>Far away, tucked behind
the hills of North India</i>

2
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,166
<i>lies our little town, Riverdale.</i>

3
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,166
<i>It was founded in 1914</i>

4
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,833
<i>by Sir John Riverdale,</i>

5
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,625
<i>a British officer
whose first posting was at Bombay.</i>

6
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,666
<i>His head was occupied by his work,
but his heart was captivated</i>

7
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,625
<i>by the land and all of its bounties.</i>

8
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:04,416
<i>The sunshine, the Arabian Sea,
the jasmine flowers, the delicacies,</i>

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,375
<i>and a beautiful local girl named Sitara.</i>

10
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,250
<i>A wedding and four children later,
adventure called yet again.</i>

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,083
<i>Sir John went hunting
with the Prince of Sarna...</i>

12
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>and stumbled upon paradise.</i>

13
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,958
<i>He had found a place to call home
and to bear his name.</i>

14
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,208
<i>Sir John and his family
gathered up all their savings,</i>

15
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,625
<i>everything they owned</i>

16
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,458
<i>and leased the land
from the Prince of Sarno's father,</i>

17
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,625
<i>the Maharajah.</i>

18
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,208
<i>And a new city was built for the people</i>

19
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,333
<i>who, like Sir John's family,</i>

20
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,625
<i>were half British and half Indian.</i>

21
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,375
<i>The Anglo-Indian community.</i>

22
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,583
<i>Over time, India gained independence.</i>

23
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,083
<i>Some of the Anglo Indians left,
and some stayed.</i>

24
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,916
<i>Those who remained in Riverdale,</i>

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,875
<i>found their solace
in the heart of the town.</i>

26
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,000
<i>A grassy knoll called Green Park,</i>

27
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,375
<i>where every citizen
planted a tree of their own.</i>

28
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>In other words,
this is where the community</i>

29
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,125
<i>literally planted their roots.</i>

30
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,125
- [woman] So beautiful.
- [man] This is Green Park.

31
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,541
This is not just the heart,
but the history of Riverdale.

32
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,291
We have a tradition here
known as planting day.

33
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,291
When children from Riverdale
turn five,

34
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,958
their parents bring them all here
to plant a tree.

35
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,625
My tree is over there.

36
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:33,833
[woman] How lovely.

37
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,791
I wish every town had a park like this.

38
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,041
[Archie] Some things
are worth fighting for.

39
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,875
- [woman] Is that so?
- Yes.

40
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,541
Are there any musicians here?

41
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,833
[woman 2] Oh, yeah.
I just learned to play the sitar.

42
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,291
[Archie] This beautiful pergola
was a bandstand.

43
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,333
Music would be played there
and people would dance here.

44
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,708
This tradition lives on today.
1914-1964.

45
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,666
Can you guess
who was the last to perform here?

46
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,958
- Uh, Elvis Presley?
- No.

47
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,958
Uh, Ray Charles?

48
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,166
- No.
- Then who?

49
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,875
- The Archies.
- Who are the Archies?

50
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,250
I'm sorry,
but I have never heard of the Archies.

51
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,791
Yeah, but had you heard
of the Beatles a few years ago?

52
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,583
- [all chuckling]
- No.

53
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,625
Mark my words,
the Archies will be everywhere.

54
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,416
At which point you can proudly say
that you met the lead singer.

55
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,250
- Me.
- You're a singer?

56
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,750
Yes, I am.

57
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,916
This special tour was designed for you

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,208
by Fred Andrews
of Andrews Tours and Travel.

59
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,083
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy Green Park.

60
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,250
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

61
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,333
Thank you.

62

00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,958
{\an8}And would you tell

112
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,750
[phone ringing]

113
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,500
[man] You've come back
at the right time, Mr. Lodge.

114
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,458
Riverdale truly needs you.

115
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,208
And the Council has passed
your proposal as well.

116
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,916
I told you it would work.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,041
- [Hiram] That you did.
- They have no objection at all

118
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,916
to the plaza being built in the square.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Excellent.

120
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,208
Sir. These shops are private properties.

121
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,833
Although if they're willing to sell,
then it's fine.

122
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,625
Everything is for sale, Dawson.

123
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,833
Let's get to the point.

124
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,208
Have you moved on what we discussed?

125
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,333
The Council will give us permission
to construct a hotel?

126
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,333
Why wouldn't they?

127
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,458
Of course, they're gonna.

128
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,583
They just have to decide on the area.

129
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:58,625
My thought is...

130
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
that this will be the best spot.

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,625
- No?
- [Hiram] Hmm.

132
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,333
Well done, old chap.
That could work nicely.

133
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:08,916
Mr. Dawson.

134
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,208
You don't want
to come to a new place

135
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,000
and land up in the outskirts now, do you?

136
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,583
You want to be where the life is.

137
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,375
The food, the shops...

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,041
Hmm.

139
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,833
This would be better, wouldn't it?

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,625
But that's Green Park.

141
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,625
That's your spot, right in the heart.

142
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,916
Hotel Riverdale can't be far
from the town center, Hiram.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,250
All my best business ideas,
My American gives me.

144
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,375
[Hiram laughs]

145
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,375
Green Park will definitely be
a controversial choice.

146
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:54,250
That's why, needless to say,
my name can't come up at all.

147
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,250
Once the Council permissions go through,

148
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,125
you can get a few companies
to submit offers.

149
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:05,125
- But naturally, you will select...
- Lodge Industries.

150
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,166
Good man.

151
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,041
Getting permission requires five votes.

152
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,708
But I will try my best, Mr. Lodge.

153
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,666
- Try?
- Yes.

154
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,750
Trying will get you nowhere, Dawson.

155
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,291
Now go get the votes.

156
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,916
If I were the District Corporator,
you know, I'd get it done easily.

157
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,208
So, what's stopping you
from standing for election?

158
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,583
Elections are... They're quite costly.

159
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,291
You understand me, right, Mr. Lodge?

160
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,541
Well done, Dawson.

161
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,041
You understand politics.

162
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,416
I'm impressed.

163
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,458
Now help me help you.

164
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,708
I want Green Park for the hotel. Hmm?

165
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,083
But first a plaza in the town square.

166
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,916
[bell dings]

167
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,708
Mango milkshake.

168
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,916
[woman]
Who's the best doggie in the world?

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,208
- [dog whines]
- Hamburger.

170
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,750
Hot Dog, do you find Moosey handsome?

171
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,625
[Moose] Hot Dog can't talk.

172
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,208
Is that so, Hot Dog?

173
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,208
- [Hot Dog whining]
- [both chuckling]

174
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,000
Put that burger down, Jones!

175
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,750
My tips should handle it, Pops.

176
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,875
Your tips aren't enough to cover it, kid.
What about the rest?

177
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:36,333
It's okay. I don't mind sharing.

178
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,500
Huh.

179
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,458
You should mind, Ethel.

180
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:43,250
He just cares about eating.
He's oblivious to your feelings.

181
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,916
"Oblivious"?

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,416
What is "oblivious"?

183
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,250
[man] You don't know
what "oblivious" means, Moose?

184
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,333
[Moose] No.

185
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,875
I calculate you've already lived
about 25% of your life?

186
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,291
Tell me, what have you learned so far?

187
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,750
Nothing.

188
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,666
- [woman] Moose! [giggling]
- [Moose] What's so funny?

189
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,125
[gate creaks]

190
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,208
Aunty Hermione!

191
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,708
[Hermione] Look who's here!

192
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:24,416
Betty! Baby, how lovely to see you.

193
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,708
- Aw.
- These are for you.

194
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,791
- Will you put these in my bedroom, please?
- Sure.

195
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,633
- You all set for the party tonight?
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,125
Still haven't worked out
your evening wear?

197
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Oh.

198
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,416
[Veronica squealing]

199
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,958

200
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,375
[Betty] "Darlings."

201
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:49,083
I can't believe you can stick
eyelashes on. This is so mod.

202
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:52,208
You keep it. My dad can always
get some more for me, later.

203
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,458
No, two gifts are plenty, Ronnie.

204
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,458
What happened to
"What's mine is yours," Betts?

205
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,958
We still share everything, I hope?

206
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,291
For always and ever.

207
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,541
[chuckles]

208
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay. Now, what do you think?

209
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,916
This dress? Or this one?

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,791
So, that's really cute,
and that's really short.

211
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,083
It's called a mini.
It's all the rage in London.

212
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,166
But remember, you're not in London,
you're in Riverdale.

213
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,916
Or Riverdale should
remember something, too.

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,333
That Veronica is back.

215
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,625
I've missed you.

216
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,958
So, tell me, Archie, how is he?

217
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,833
After I left town...

218
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:33,875
has he seen anyone else?

219
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,208
He's dated everyone, but no one.

220
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,583
I thought you didn't care.

221
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,375
I... I don't. I was just asking
about the latest.

222
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,750
The latest is that
most of us work part-time jobs now.

223
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,375
Jobs? I look cute?

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're so cute.

225
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,208
[sighs in exasperation]

226
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,000
But I'm not in the mood for cute.

227
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,458
- [Dilton] Look into the lens.
- [Reggie] Looking.

228
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,250
- [Archie] Hurry up, Doiley.
- Okay.

229
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,250
- [shutter clicks]
- Got it.

230
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,000
Look at all this stuff.

231
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,791
Yeah, Ronnie throws the best parties.

232
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,541
[sighs] You know, my dad was asking
if the party would have any adults.

233
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,458
I said, "Please, Dad. We're 17 now!"

234
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,000
My mom is the same with that.
"Say no to booze."

235
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,541
Aunty Jeanie should know,

236
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,083
that if her son's talking
to bottles, it's too late.

237
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,208
- That's so funny.
- Thank you, Dilly.

238
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:30,041
But Reggie's jokes got a cost.
Go on, I want a raspberry soda.

239
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,708
- Okay. Do you want anything?
- No.

240
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,833
Stop treating Dilly like your Man Friday.

241
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,333
- I'm talking to you.
- Va!

242
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,291
- [wolf whistling]
- Welcome back, Veronica!

[all cheering]

246
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,000
Hi! I missed...

247
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,166
- Hello.
- You look lovely!

248
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,875
- Hello, Moosey.
- Hi, Ronnie.

249
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,708
Hello, Sughead.

250
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,166
My name is "Jughead."

251
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,000
What's the "S" for then?

252
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,666
- Sandwich.
- Why?

253
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,583
- Where are we going?
- "Why?"

254
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,208
You still terrify Jughead.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,083
Hello.

256
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,083
Hi, there.

257
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,916
Since when did you get so cute?

258
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,166
- Thank you.
- [chuckling]

259
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,541
- You look cute too, Arch.
- Thank you.

260
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,750
- I have something for you.
- Oh, yeah?

261
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,083
Ronnie! What?

262
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,666

263
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,875

00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,083
Happy birthday to me!

265
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,125
Do you know how to dance?

266
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,958
I learned after you left.

267
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,916

Listen. You guys go.

303
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,125
Why? What is it?

304
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,500
I forgot my record.
But you guys should go.

The gift is dynamite.

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,916
What can I possibly get you in return?

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,416
Hmm.

- Dinner? The CC.
- CC?

Mm-hmm.

316
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,375
Okay, great,
let me just sell my guitar then.

317
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,125
If that's a problem for you,
I'm sure Reggie can handle it.

318
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,958
Yeah. He pawned his guitar
before I came back.

No, sir.

Then remove yourself
from my property this instant.

to Archie all the time.

What will the difference
between Riverdale and anywhere else?

347
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,000
Grammar, Fred. "What 'will be.'"

348
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,208
Ah, trying to teach your father
how to suck eggs, huh?

349
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,125
Yes, I am.

350
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,500
- Archie!
- Yeah?

351
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,625
- What is this?
- Why are you going through my stuff?

352
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,708
Because I gave birth to you,
and you're still wet behind the ears.

353
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,458
You applied to a university,
over in England?

354
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,708
Uncle Ben said if I want to live there,

355
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,375
it's better if I study there as well.

356
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,208
You spoke to my brother first?

357
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,375
You really want to leave Riverdale?

358
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,416
London is the coolest city ever, Dad.

359
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Really?

360
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,000
Yes! And I'm lucky
because I can go there easily,

361
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,916
since Grandpa was British.

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,208
And what will I do here?

363
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,041
It'll be your travel agency,
or work on the railways.

364
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,916
Imagine if Cliff Richard
had not left Lucknow.

365
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,250
Trust me. Everything is possible there.

366
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,458
I can make music that'll reach people.
Music that will really...

367
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,916
To make art you have to go in,
my son, not out.

368
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:46,000
- [bell tolling]
- "We know what we are,

369
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,083
but know not what we may be."

370
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,791
William Shakespeare said that.

371
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,416
{\an8}Nothing changes if nothing changes.

372
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,666
- Dilly, I don't like riddles.
- But if you change

373
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,375
- the way you look at life...
- Moose, it's a quote.

374
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,666
Quote?

375
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,708
...the life you look at will change. Hmm?

376
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,250
Wonderful, wonderful!

377
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,416
- Too good!
- [Weatherbee] Thank you.

378
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:22,500
What Mr. Weatherbee is trying to say
is that change is inevitable.

379
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,958
Excuse me, Miss Grundy.

380
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,791
Yes, Mantle.

381
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,583
If change is inevitable,

382
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,916
then how come I didn't get mine back
from Jughead yesterday?

383
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,041
[all laughing]

384
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,500
Sorry, I used it for lunch.

385
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,666
- [student] Jughead for Principal!
- Very clever!

386
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,375
Okay! You kids have a bright future ahead.

387
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,291
- Juggy, do you know about "UGAJ"?
- Hmm? What's that?

388
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,583
It's a group in school.
"United Girls Against Jughead."

389
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,583
What did I do?

390
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,791
I didn't join it.

391
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,708
- Please join.
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

392
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,791
How can they build a hotel here?

393
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:00,583
What? Green Park will be gone?

394
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
[chuckles softly]

395
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,458
Thank you.

396
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,458
This is not the time to get emotional.

397
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,625
I need you both.

398
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,208
Tell me.

399
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,666
Can I depend on you?

400
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:25,125
If you enter the Corporator election,
of course, you will have our vote.

401
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,875
- Yeah.
- Give.

402
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,541
When I win,

403
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,375
I'll make you Council Head...

404
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,625
Ah!

405
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:37,041
...and nominate you
as Council Secretary. I promise.

406
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,416
Mm-hmm.

407
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,208
But Gomes? Right now, he's your secretary.

408
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,041
True fact.

409
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,875
But he has shown loyalty
only to Riverdale.

410
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,416
He'll go straight
to the <i>Gazette</i> with this news.

411
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:54,875
[Reggie] Knock, knock.

412
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,791
Who's there?

413
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,791
- Who?
- Who, who?

414
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,833
[laughing]

415
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:09,041
Do you think your stupid jokes will help
you build a future, Reginald Mantle?

416
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,125
Comedy is an art, Dad.

417
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,416
I think there's
a real profession in comedy.

418
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,875
A profession is a doctor, a lawyer,
engineer, a journalist!

419
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:22,333
Your grandfather
didn't leave us this newspaper

420
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,333
so we could write a jokes column.

421
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,541
The British once ruled this country

422
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,791
and the newspapers could only print
their propaganda at that time.

423
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,916
No form of criticism was allowed.

424
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,041
And despite all that,

425
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:43,250
your grandfather printed messages here
about gaining support for freedom.

426
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,833
Did you know that?

427
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:49,041
And the same thing he did back then,
has become our job.

428
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,083
And we have a social responsibility.

429
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:54,166
Haven't I taught you that?

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,750
Then forget this comedy.

431
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,666
If you want to write,
then make it meaningful.

432
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,916
You can go.

433
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:15,708
"And as the Giraffe gazed at the stars,
she said, 'Drift me down into slumber.'"

434
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:19,791
"'For when I'm the tallest,
I'm hoping to forget them.'"

435
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,583
"'No matter how small-ish!'"

436
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,291
- Yay. Once more.
- Again.

437
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,375
Again?

438
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,851
- Yes, again.
- Once more, Uncle Hal!

439
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,416
- Thanks.
- Bye.

440
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,583
- Let's go.
- Bye.

441
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,750
Bye!

442
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,208
Hal.

443
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,208
Oh, Johnny, your timing's great.

444
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,666
- Tea?
- Oh, no, thanks.

445
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:45,083
I'm here to pick up Marge.
So I thought I'd have a word with you.

446
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,166
Everything okay?

447
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,166
So... The shop received
an offer today.

448
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,708
It's a very good one, actually.

449
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,750
I thought as my best tenant,

450
00:24:55,833 --> 00:25:00,125
I should ask you first
if you can match the price or not?

451
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,708
The offer is?

452
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:05,291
Uh... [chuckles nervously]

453
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,416
Double.

454
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,333
Huh.

455
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,541
I sell books, Johnny.
How can I come up with double?

456
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,583
Sorry, my friend.

457
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:22,208
All right. Well, I'll talk to Alice.

458
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,750
I'll ring you.

459
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:25,666
Hmm.

460
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,458
What are we going to do, Dad?

461
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,625
"You cannot swim for new horizons

462
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:46,666
until you have the courage
to lose sight of the shore."

463
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,333
William Faulkner.

464
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,458
Dad.

465
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,250
Don't worry, Betts.
We'll come up with a solution.

466
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,000
But you tell me first...

467
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,541
In eight hours, whose birthday is it?

468
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,833
And what are you kids planning?

469
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,916
Nothing. Think they forgot.

470
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,541
I remembered.

471
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,916
[both chuckling]

472
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,666
[Fred] Yes, Ben,
but I need a ballpark figure.

473
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,708
That's just tuition.
What about all the other stuff?

474
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:21,625
How do I look?

475
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,541
Just like you did an hour ago.

476
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,625
Don't be grumpy, Mary.

477
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,083
Shh. I'm trying to work out how
to fund your education.

478
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,875
Uncle Ben said he'd take care of it.

479
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,416
Your education is my problem.
I will take care of it.

480
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,791
But I don't want to be a problem.

481
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:36,208
Too late for that.

482
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,500
Go. Bye.

483
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,208
[Veronica] Really? I just got back
and you're going to London?

484
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:47,250
- [Archie] I've only just applied.
- [Veronica] You'll get in.

485
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,958
[concierge] Shoes are required
for dining.

486
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,125
Shoes are the shackles
of our civilization, sir.

487
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:57,458
And this is the protocol of our CC.
Only brogues or loafers.

488
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,625
- But I am a loafer.
- [Veronica chuckles]

489
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:03,375
May I use your phone, please?

490
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,958
Hello. Hi, Katy, can I speak to Daddy?

491
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,791
- Who's Katy?
- My father's PA.

492
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,750
You have to go through your dad's PA
to talk to him?

493
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,083
He's a busy man.

494
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,333
Hello. Hi, Daddy.

495
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,083
Can you speak to this chappy at the CC?

496
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:29,416
- He is not letting Archie in.
- [sighs]

497
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,166
Mr. Lodge for you.

498
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,250
[concierge] Please follow me.

499
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,958
[indistinct chatter]

500
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,500
[doorbell rings]

501
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,375
[Alice] Betty, would you get the door?

502
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,125
[upbeat music playing]

503
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:50,250
[whines]

504
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,166
Hot Dog?

505
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,791
[all] Surprise!

506
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:55,666
- Surprise!
- [laughing]

507
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,333
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

508
00:27:57,416 --> 00:27:58,708
Mwah.

509
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,875
- Happy birthday, Betts. This is Rita.
- Thank you.

510
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,291
- Hi, Rita.
- Happy birthday!

511
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,750
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

512
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,333
Where are Ronnie and Arch?

513
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,291
[Hal] Alice, come.

514
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:14,625
Um, I'll have the trout
with the glazed potatoes.

515
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:15,833
Very good, ma'am.

516
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:16,791
And for you, sir?

517
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,833
Does this lamb cure asthma?

518
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,166
I don't think so, sir.

519
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,083
Then why does it cost so much?

520
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,375
Sorry.

521

Here's an idea I had.

What if we build this grand hotel...

- Center?
- Yes.

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,875
- The elevation over there...
- Yeah.

868
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:48,875
[Ricky] <i>Redevelopment?</i>

869
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,208
Of Green Park, huh?

870
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:52,083
Uncle Benny told me.

871
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,333
The Council
is not renewing his license.

872
00:48:54,416 --> 00:48:56,375
Uncle Benny from the snack shop?

873
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:58,541
Is that your source?

874
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,041
I saw it with my own eyes, Dad.

875
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,166
Some city men were surveying the place.

876
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,458
- There's definitely a plan.
- What are you talking about, Reg?

877
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:09,541
The community has its roots in Green Park.
Come on.

878
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:13,541
The Council will never allow it.
They'll never pass it.

879
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,708
Find facts, son, not conspiracy theories.

880
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,333
Yeah, you're right, Ricky.

881
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,208
- [Ricky] Play on, Dennis.
- [Reggie sighs]

882
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,458
[Mrs. Otter] <i>Weird.
Kevin never spoke about you.</i>

883
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:39,708
That was one of the things I respected
most about your husband, Mrs. Otter.

884
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:41,250
He never name-dropped.

885
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:45,166
He would personally
make my drink every evening,

886
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:50,541
and with that whisky, we would also
share one cigarette between the two of us.

887
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:53,875
- It was our ritual.
- But Kevin didn't smoke.

888
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:54,958
Uh...

889
00:49:55,875 --> 00:50:00,041
Uh, he knew how much you hated it,
and didn't want to bother you.

890
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:04,583
Well, he did die of cancer,
and that has been a bit of a bother.

891
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,458
I know.

892
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,791
And that is precisely
why I've called you here.

893
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:16,166
Kevin was more than just a bartender here,

894
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:18,541
he was a friend.

895
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:24,458
And I feel it is my responsibility
to make sure that his son is well settled.

896
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,666
Mm. Oh. My son.

897
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:30,333
He's failed out twice.

898
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,666
That Laurie is a duffer.

899
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:35,750
Don't worry about that, Mrs. Otter.

900
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,583
Because I've heard that the Town Council

901
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:41,666
is considering giving approval for a hotel
to be built in Green Park.

902
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,083
Can you believe that?

903
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:45,916
- I'm not so sure...
- If that happens,

904
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:48,083
I'm going to be investing in it.

905
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:51,750
And maybe I could offer Laurie
a managerial position.

906
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,750
He could work with me.

907
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:58,458
I mean, if he has half of Kevin's looks,

908
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,583
and a quarter of your charm,

909
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:03,500
he would be perfect
in the service industry.

910
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:07,500
The Council will vote after
the Founders' Ball. So, fingers crossed.

911
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,041
We have to get a picture.

912
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,916
Ronnie, I think
we need a photo together.

913
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,583
Absolutely not.

914
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:15,583
What? Why not?

915
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,583
Because then everyone will know
I came with you.

916
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:20,041
[Reggie] You did come with me.

917
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,375

00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,750
She's giving up her flower shop.

1041
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Why are you feeling guilty, you bugger?

1042
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,500
You do what you need to.

1043
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,958
Even Marge said the same thing.

1044
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:08,708
I feel like we should sell it all
and let's move to Sydney.

1045
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,041
Her brother's there, now.

1046
00:58:10,666 --> 00:58:11,708
Wait, sell?

1047
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,125
- You're selling the shops?
- Hiram Lodge.

1048
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:18,000
They changed the offer
from double to buying.

1049
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,208
Uncle Hiram is gonna buy it all?

1050
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,041
He wants to buy every building.

1051
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:24,791
He's gonna bulldoze the block
and build a huge plaza.

1052
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,541
Please don't sell it.

1053
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:27,916
Betty.

1054
00:58:33,083 --> 00:58:36,583
Can you vacate by the end of the week?

1055
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,041

You go on ahead.
I'm gonna be here a while.

1061
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,708
- You are?
- I work here till dinnertime.

1062
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:27,791
Shoot!

1063
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:29,625
Did you talk to Ronnie?

1064
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:33,750
- Your client's waiting, Missy.
- I'm coming.

1065

Andrews. It's from England.

1068
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:03,583
Mom!

1069
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,625
These are tough times.

1070
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:11,625
God knows
how long this café will even last!

1071
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,250
Well, I won't go anywhere, Pops.

1072
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,083
I'll stay no matter
how much anyone else offers.

1073
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,166
Excuse me?

1074
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:21,541
We have the right to try
to get ahead in this world.

1075
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,041
Morning, gang.

1076
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,125
Guess who got into Batterton College.

1077
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:28,250
- What?
- Hey! Congratulations!

1078
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,500
Nice work!

1079
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
- Congrats, Archie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1080
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:37,916
- Hi. Hi! Congratulations!
- Hello. Thank you.

1081
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:43,541
Oh. Betty, you can't be looking so upset.
This is a great thing for Archie.

1082
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:49,208
Ronnie, I'm not upset 'cause of that.
They closed my dad's bookstore.

1083
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,166
What? Why?

1084
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:54,250
Because your dad decided to buy
all of the shops in the town square,

1085
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,375
bulldoze them, and put in a plaza.

1086
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:59,583
- That's not Ronnie's fault, though.
- Archie, I wasn't saying that.

1087
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:05,416
Betty, I had no idea.
I'm so sorry you're so upset, truly.

1088
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,791
He's going to lose his job
because of your father.

1089
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,416
[Archie] Hey, that's not fair.

1090
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,833
Come on, Betts.

1091
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:13,375
What? It's true.

1092
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:16,375
Betty, my father
was also just doing his job.

1093
01:01:16,458 --> 01:01:18,791
And he always says,
when you're doing business,

1094
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,708
you have to set aside your feelings,

1095
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,666
because it's not personal.

1096
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,541
Your father doesn't know
what's personal.

1097
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,791
- Of course that's what he said!
- Excuse me?

1098
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,708
Ronnie, my father's more than
a book salesman, okay?

1099
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:33,541
He helps to shape the ideas
and personalities of children.

1100
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:35,416
He actually cares about them.

1101
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,291
Meanwhile, you still have to contact
your own father's secretary

1102
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,291
if you want to speak to him, I mean...

1103
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,708
[Dilton] What just happened?

1104
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:50,916
I don't know.

1105
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,666
Why is she behaving like this?

1106
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:56,041
She's upset, and why wouldn't she be?

1107
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:59,291
You can't let profits rule everything.
For some people there's more to life.

1108
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:00,833
Go get stuffed, Jughead!

1109
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:04,083
My father is a businessman,
and I'm not gonna feel guilty about that.

1110
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,541
And I'm not gonna be apologetic
for my ambition.

1111
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,500
[Archie] Easy, guys. Relax.

1112
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:10,125
It's all okay.

1113
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,583
Really? It's all okay?

1114
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:17,458
Okay, how come
you are leaving Riverdale, then?

1115
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:18,708
Hmm?

1116
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,791
Welcome to adulthood.

1117
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,583
Is Daddy in a meeting?

1118
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:40,041
He'll be free by 8:00 this evening.

1119
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,833
[phone ringing]

1120
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,000
Mr. Lodge's office.

1121
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,500
[Hermione] Ah, finally, Frenny,
you've given me a card.

1122
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:48,583
Oh, hi.

1123
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:54,250
Are you free to talk, or do I need
an appointment for you as well?

1124
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:57,375
- I always have time for melodrama.
- [woman chuckles]

1125
01:02:57,458 --> 01:02:59,541
Excuse me, ladies.
I'll just be a moment.

1126
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,708
- Yes, sure.
- Sure.

1127
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:02,166
Stop looking at my cards, Frenny.

1128
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,333
Ronnie, honey. What's going on?

1129
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:07,666
Betty's father was evicted
from his bookshop.

1130
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,791
Oh!

1131
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,500
Sad.

1132
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,333
I like the Coopers.

1133
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,958
The landlord is going to sell
and Daddy's buying it.

1134
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:20,791
Darling, in all fairness,
it's the landlord's decision.

1135
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:23,416
But Uncle Hal has lost his livelihood.

1136
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:27,166
Cooper is a good man.
He'll find a job again, soon.

1137
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,625
- How do you know?
- Because I'll make sure of it.

1138
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:36,958
Now we commence the voting for permission
to build a grand hotel

1139
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:40,208
on the land which is now Green Park.

1140
01:03:41,708 --> 01:03:43,541
I vote yea.

1141
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:47,750
Yea.

1142
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,125
Nay.

1143
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,583
I say yea.

1144
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,416
I say nay.

1145
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,958
I'm also a nay.

1146
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,208
I say yea.

1147
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:17,291
[Dawson] Mrs. Misquitta?

1148
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,083
It's up to you now.

1149
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:30,416
Um, I, sir, vote yea.

1150
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,541
What?

1151
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,583
You can't do this to Green Park!

1152
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,625
[Dawson] It's five votes
in favor of the hotel.

1153
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,333
Gomes, inform the <i>Gazette</i>

1154
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,125
that we're accepting offers now.

1155
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,666
The hotel goes through!

[music playing on radio]

1157
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:05,708
What's going on?

1158
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:07,833
Tell her, Hal.

1159
01:05:10,958 --> 01:05:12,458
Well, the new bookstore going in?

1160
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,708
I've been offered
the assistant manager's post.

1161
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:17,666
I start tomorrow!

1162
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:20,500
- Can you believe it?
- [Alice] Tell her what your new salary is.

1163
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,416
Don't show off, Alice.

1164
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,500
Bless that Hiram Lodge.
He personally recommended me, Betts.

1165
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:32,958
[Alice] What's wrong, baby?

1166
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,875
Have you come bearing gifts?

1167
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,458
Chocolate fudge! Your favorite.

1168
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:52,625
- What's the best thing about cake?
- What?

1169
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,541
Any time of day, it's delicious.

1170
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,291
You should've seen my dad's face.
He was so relieved.

1171
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:03,333
After the way I behaved,
what you did for my dad,

1172
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:05,041
I really don't know how to thank you.

1173
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:09,291
Do keep trying.

1174
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:11,958
Now tell me,

1175
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,833
- have you missed me like crazy?
- Of course.

1176
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,541
[school bell tolling]

1177
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:18,916
And let's not forget our school's motto.

1178
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,166
"There is no excellence without labor."

1179
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,750
And now to conclude this assembly,
we have an announcement.

1180
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:29,916
As of next month, Pop Tate's
will no longer run our cafeteria.

1181
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,916
What?

1182
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,583
The school will introduce pre-packed
lunchboxes from Chaplin and Company.

1183
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,041
[all booing]

1184
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,541
- No.
- Thank you.

1185
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,708
In London, we had pre-packed meals.

1186
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:49,208
Ronnie said that
it's normal in London.

1187
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:53,666
- So? It's okay 'cause it's normal there?
- That's not what I meant.

1188
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,875
Mr. Chaplin doesn't have the power
to decide that.

1189
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:58,458
- We don't know that.
- But it's Pop Tate's, Archie!

1190
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,833
Pop makes my burgers with extra cheese.

1191
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:03,958
No tomatoes for Betty,
no mustard for Moose.

1192
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:05,541
He makes it for us.

1193
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,875
Well, Pop Tate's café
is, unfortunately, closing, Jughead.

1194
01:07:09,958 --> 01:07:11,375
The school is growing.

1195
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,583
The funds used,
and the how and the when,

1196
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:16,875
the board has to make
some hard decisions.

1197
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,375
At the cost of what, Miss Grundy?

1198
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,625
Let's discuss that today.

1199
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,125
[sighs] My dad wrote an article.

1200
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,166
Saying, all this redevelopment

1201
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,583
is in the interest
of a few large corporations.

1202
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,000
What does that mean?

1203
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:34,500
[Jughead] Don't take it personally.

1204
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:38,125
This discussion is about
public interest v. corporate interest.

1205
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,041
What are your thoughts, Archie?

1206
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:46,166
To be honest, Miss Grundy,

1207
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:49,666
I don't really think much
about that stuff.

1208
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:51,125

Wait. So, you don't think about your life?

1210

I get a huge kick out of life.

1211
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:59,291
But I just don't think about politics.
What's it got to do with my life?

- Sure.

1269
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:35,000
Well, in the town square,
the bookstore there was mine.

1270
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,708
- Oh, really?
- Hal's.

1271
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:40,375
And every week, I had
a story hour for children.

1272
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,500
It's actually a great idea.

1273
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:44,000
How much do you charge for it?

1274
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:47,083
Nada! All free. Just to instill
a love for books, that's all.

1275
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:53,458
See, Hal. We want to attract the kind of
customers here who'll actually buy things.

1276
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:57,916
If it's just to entertain the kids,
it's not profitable to the bookstore.

1277
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,833
We've got monthly targets
to achieve, right?

1278
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:03,291
Yeah? Let me know
if there's anything else though.

1279
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:13,833
- Mary.
- How lovely, Alice.

1280
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,916
- Thank you.
- That looks excellent.

1281
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,041
- See you later.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,083
I hope you're coming tonight.

Of course, aunty.
As soon as I'm done with my shift.

1286
01:12:25,958 --> 01:12:28,125
Oh, dear. I forgot to bring my wallet.

1287
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:30,958
- No credit.
- I'm so sorry.

1288
01:12:31,041 --> 01:12:32,601
- I was in such a rush...
- Don't worry.

1289
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:34,333
You can bring it anytime tomorrow.

1290
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,333
Thank you. Thank you.

01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,666
Next time I'm dealing
with my clients, don't interfere, got it?

1292
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:44,541
Interfere? That's Aunty Mary.

1293
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,250
I don't care.
The rules are very clear.

1294
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:48,875
I'm paying you double your salary.

1295
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:50,875
Now go get the money from her.

1296
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:55,500
What are you looking at, stupid?

1297
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,344
- Do you not understand my words?
- Please don't talk to me like that!

1298
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:01,333
And no amount of money will get me
to be mean to my friend's mother.

1300
01:13:17,541 --> 01:13:18,958
Yes? Can I help you?

1301
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,291
Can I please have my job back?

1302
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:25,000
I made a mistake.

1303
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,625
Can you forgive me?

1304
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:31,166
Come.

[Alice] All right, Fred. We believe you.

[Fred] And when times get rough,
I take it out

1312
01:13:54,041 --> 01:13:55,291
and I remind myself

1313
01:13:55,375 --> 01:13:57,333
that I can survive anything,

1314
01:13:57,416 --> 01:14:00,500
if I've survived being married to Mary!

1315
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,375

01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:45,208
- I'm fine. I'm...
- [man] Michael, shut up.

1377
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,125
[snoring]

1378
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,250
[Mary] What?

1379
01:17:49,333 --> 01:17:51,833
Green Park will be converted into a hotel?

1380
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,750
[Ricky] Yes.

1381
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,833
The <i>Gazette</i> has to put out
a call for offers.

1382
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:59,416
And how will they do that?

1383
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,791
They're saying they'll reserve
a section for residents.

1384
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:03,583
Riverdale's residents, or the hotel's?

1385
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
You were right, Reg.

1386
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:09,750
[Jones] Let's look at the bright side.

1387
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:12,416
If the tourists are there,
the jobs are also there.

1388
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,875
The jobs "will" also there.

1389
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,708
Well, that's also wrong.

1390
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,583
Bloody hell, I never get it right.

1391
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:20,208
More tourists mean more business
for you, Fred.

1392
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,291
Dad, Green Park...

1393
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:24,250
I'm sorry, but not everything
is about profit, Jones.

1394
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:28,291
- Can't you all do something together?
- What can we do, Reg?

1395
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:30,666
Some big people must be behind this.

1396
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:33,541
People like us don't matter.

1397
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,583
Uncle Ricky, how about if you speak
to the Council?

1398
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:39,250
I tried.

1399
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:42,083
Only Esther and Gomes
are against it.

1400
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:44,833
Money makes the world go around, Mantle.

1401
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:46,541
It's a really sad reality.

1402
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,500
They also closed down
our bookstore.

1403
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:50,625
Maybe we should see
what we can get in return.

1404
01:18:50,708 --> 01:18:53,083
- In return for Green Park?
- Baby.

1405
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,416
That's where we were the day
Independence was declared.

1406
01:18:58,208 --> 01:18:59,541
These kids had just been born.

1407
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,083
Their first steps in free India

1408
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,833
were taken in Green Park.

1409
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:11,625
How can you put a price on that, Alice?

1410
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,416
I know. It is what it is, Fred.

1411
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:18,833
Hey, Dad.

1412
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,250
I want to interview the Council Head.

1413
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,541
Go ahead. Do it.

1414
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:28,291
I'm coming with you.

1415
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,666
[Dawson] London, Paris, New York,
I have heard all these places

1416
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:38,666
offer a grand hotel
in the heart of town.

1417
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,666
And I've heard,
they also offer parks that are central.

1418
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,416
You have a number in your eye, or what?

1419
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,625
Listen, why do you need this park?

1420
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,666
Everywhere you look, there is greenery.

1421
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:51,083
Green Park is our history.

1422
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:53,583
Those are our trees.
That's where we've grown up.

1423
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:57,083
Come on, the hotel will keep a portion
for their private gardens.

1424
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:59,625
Everything won't be ripped out. I promise.

1425
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,916
- What?
- [Archie] Ripped out?

1426
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:05,916
They plan to cut the trees?

1427
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,375
See, the Town Council has passed it.

1428
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:11,833
And Riverdale's citizens are the ones
who elected the Council.

1429
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:13,333
It was all democratic.

1430
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:16,291
But what if
the people don't agree with them?

1431
01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:17,833
Who are these people?

1432
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:21,000
[Gomes] The Council's decision
can be reversed.

1433
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,666
- Really?
- Yes.

1434
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,666
If served a petition signed by more
than 50% of Riverdale's population.

1435
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:30,791
- What are you talking, Gomes?
- And how many people would that be?

1436
01:20:31,208 --> 01:20:33,041
4500 should be enough.

1437
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:36,500
Our current population is 8876.

1438
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,375
How much time
do we have for this petition?

1439
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:40,416
Forty-five days
since Council passed it.

1440
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,125
- Forty-five days?
- The whole school will sign it, right?

1441
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:45,958
The petition can only be signed
by those 18 and above.

1442
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,041
Yes.

1443
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:50,125
Because children don't count.

1444
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:51,583
[bell dings]

1445
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:52,916
Thank you.

1446
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,583
Wait. So our parents don't count,
we don't count.

1447
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,333
Then who does count in this town?

1448
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:00,875
I don't know.

1449
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:03,875
If we actually let them take this park,
they won't stop there.

1450
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:05,833
Trust me. They won't save
a single tree.

1451
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:08,375
Hey, don't lose hope.
A petition might work.

1452
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:09,375
[Betty] How so?

1453
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:12,125
[Archie] If at least
half of Riverdale's residents sign it,

1454
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:13,541
they can't do anything.

1455
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,041
[Reggie] That's the law.

1456
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:18,875
I'm going to write an article
to inform the whole town.

1457
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,208
Can we reach
4000 people through your paper, Reg?

1458
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:23,583
The <i>Gazette</i> goes to everyone.

1459
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:26,166
[Veronica]
But how will we collect the signatures?

1460
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,541
The paper can only print the article.

1461
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:32,375
Okay, so at the end of the article,
put instructions, you know.

1462
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:37,416
"Dear reader, if you wish to save
Green Park, write a note, sign it,

1463
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,000
and then send it via mail
to the posted address." Simple!

1464
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,750
Doiley, you're a genius, huh?

1465
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:43,916
Thank you.

1466
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,750
- [Betty] Thank you.
- [Jughead] Thank you!

1467
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:48,291
[Jughead] Good thing Dilly's
not going to London with Archie,

1468
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,333
or else we would lose the park.

1469
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:52,500
- [Archie] Shut up, Jughead.
- [Betty] It's true.

1470
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,625
[Ben] <i>So, Archie, all set?</i>

1471
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:55,958
Yes, Uncle Ben, all set.

1472
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:59,166
<i>Okay. I'm going to be at the airport
to pick you up.</i>

1473
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,625
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

1474
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,916
<i>And your aunt,
she's redone the room for you.</i>

1475
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,500
Can I get you anything from here?

1476
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:06,583
<i>Yes, please, some Kul-kuls.</i>

1477
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,041
Kul-kuls. Okay.

1478
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,041
<i>Oh, and some spicy salt fish pickles.</i>

1479
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,000
Spicy salt fish pickles.
Okay, I'll tell Mom.

1480
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:13,750
<i>You're excited?</i>

1481
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:16,333
Yeah, I am excited.

1482
01:22:16,416 --> 01:22:17,916
<i>Well, I am glad to hear that.</i>

1483
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,583
<i>There's nothing left for you
in Riverdale, Archie.</i>

1484
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:23,291
<i>You'll love it here.
Your life is about to start.</i>

1485
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,375
Reginald Mantle.

1486
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,166
- This is very, very good.
- So you'll print it?

1487
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:41,583
- Dennis.
- Yes.

1488
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:43,208
Shift all the articles around.

1489
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,291
- Monday morning front page.
- Okay.

1490
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,791
- My son has come of age.
- [Reggie] Oh, my God! Andrews!

1491
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:50,666
It's done!

1492
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:54,875
For a moment I thought
he was giving me a jokes column.

1493
01:22:54,958 --> 01:22:57,083
[Archie] You wouldn't use it.
He's not very funny.

1494
01:22:57,166 --> 01:22:59,958
[Reggie] One day you'll realize
the value of a comedian.

1495
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,458
When will it be printed, uncle?

1496
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:05,083
[Ricky] Come back from your holiday,
and it'll be in the paper.

1497
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:10,916
[Veronica] Welcome to
the "I Love Archie" farewell weekend.

1498
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:16,041
We have T-shirts.

1499
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,500
And some shades.

1500
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:23,625
Dilly, please remember,
camera on my left profile only,

1501
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:25,166
uh, and this height.

1502
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,250
So we'll just have to find a way
for you to shoot yourself then.

1503
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:30,708
I have.

1504
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:33,958
Oh, you have a film camera
and you still don't know

1505
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,791
that, "Cinema is truth
24 times a second."

1506
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:39,041
The French director Godard
was who said that.

1507
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:41,541
How you look is not what's important,

1508
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:44,541
it's how you feel, guys, you know.
That's what's important.

1509
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:49,916
Thank you.

1510
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,250
[all together] Thank you!

1511
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,666
[all laughing]

1512
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,625
I heard you had news.

1513
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,583
This better be good, Dennis.

1514
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:10,333
[chattering]

1515
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,375
[Archie] Hey, Reg, I jumped in first.

1516
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:20,083
- The water looks a bit cold.
- You can tell by looking? Wow.

1517
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,958
Just push him in, Betts.

1518
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:26,333
- What?
- Best idea since sliced bread.

1519
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:28,083
[squeals]

1520
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:32,958
- Why are you all on my case?
- Because you're a scaredy cat.

1521
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:34,916
What? No.

1522
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Just come in, Reggie. It's lovely.

1523
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:38,958
[Ethel] Truth or dare?

1524
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:41,083
Say you're a scaredy cat or jump in!

1525
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:48,875
[all] Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.

1526
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:53,333
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.

1527
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:55,458
- [all cheering]
- [exhales]

1528
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,625
[Jughead] <i>I choose dare.</i>

1529
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:02,083
I dare you to give me a beat right now,

1530
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,958
- or kiss one of the girls.
- Excuse me?

1531
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,541
That's not funny.

1532
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:10,583
I don't have my drumsticks here.

1533
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:14,625
[Reggie] Exactly!

1534
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,791
[beatboxing]

1535
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,958
Are you making that sound
with your mouth?

1536
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:31,750
- He's a musical genius.
- He's a weirdo.

1537
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:34,541
[Betty] Good save, Juggy.

1538
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:36,208
Now, Dilly, your turn.

1539
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:37,333
Truth.

1540
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:40,333
Tell us a secret you have
that nobody would know.

1541
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
[Reggie] Or dare?

1542
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:45,375
- Do 50 push-ups.
- Please. I don't wanna see that.

1543
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,416
Dilly, for your dare,

1544
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,583
you will have to throw
your camera in this direction

1545
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:52,458
and the girl who catches it, keeps it.

1546
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:56,583
Come on, Dilly. Truth or dare?

1547
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:59,250
Truth. No, dare!
I want that camera. Dare.

1548
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:03,250
What?

1549
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:04,791
No, Dilly, you love that camera.

1550
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,625
Tell us a secret and the camera's yours.

1551
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:15,333
Why are you thinking so much?
All of us have secrets. It's all right.

1552
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:18,916
[Veronica] Come on, Dilly.

1553
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,541
[Archie] What happened?

1554
01:26:38,333 --> 01:26:41,000
What happened, Dilly? Are you okay?

1555
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:42,416
[Veronica] It's all right, Dilly.

1556
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:45,125
It's just a stupid game.
You don't have to answer it.

1557
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:49,708
[crying] I really didn't want to ruin
everybody's mood. I am sorry.

1558
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:53,333
[Betty] I promise, it's okay, Dilly.
We're all friends here.

1559
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:55,541
[Dilton] I know. I know.

1560
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:58,208
[Veronica] It's your party,
you can cry if you want to.

1561
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,583
[Dilton sobbing]

1562
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:11,791
[Reggie sighs]

1563
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:12,833
Are you awake?

1564
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
My eyes are open, Reggie.

1565
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:17,791
[chuckles softly]

1566
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,583
I wanted to say something.

1567
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:24,958
You're not a scaredy-cat like me.

1568
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:27,833
You are the bravest guy I know.

1569
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:35,958
And I know how you feel about me.

1570
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,791
And I also know

1571
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:42,916
for you, it's gotta be so hard,

1572
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:47,041
'cause, um, I don't feel that way.

1573
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:50,708
I just want to say that,

1574
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:52,791
that I'm here for you.

1575
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,833
And I always will be.

1576
01:27:57,625 --> 01:28:00,875
And don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anyone else.

1577
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:02,166
It's your story to tell.

1578
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:04,208
Okay?

1579
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,250
Good night.

1580
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:13,875
Good night.

1581
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,750
"Records seem to have nearly survived..."

1582
01:28:34,166 --> 01:28:36,541
[phone ringing]

1583
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,916
[Hiram] Where is Ricky Mantle?

1584
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:12,208
Good morning.

1585
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:14,291
It's a bit early to look this foxy.

1586
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,791
I thought Reggie would be
the one up first.

1587
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,916
He is losing his touch.

1588
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,125
Reggie isn't the one
you're waiting on.

1589
01:29:24,208 --> 01:29:26,958
Oh, yeah? Then tell me.
Who was I waiting on?

1590
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:39,583
Was I right?

1591
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:47,375
Come.

1592
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:00,291
- Good morning, Betts.
- What so good about this morning?

1593
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:03,708
Hi.

1594
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:11,375
Betty just bit my head off.

1595
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:13,500
What? Betty doesn't bite.

1596
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:15,958
You must've done something wrong
to upset her.

1597
01:30:17,208 --> 01:30:19,583
[Smithers] All aboard, please. All aboard!

1598
01:30:19,666 --> 01:30:22,333
Yes, Smithers.
We're sailing away soon.

1599
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:24,250

1608
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:43,791
What dispute?

1609
01:31:43,875 --> 01:31:46,333
We're only informing the people
that they have a choice.

1610
01:31:46,416 --> 01:31:47,791
I know, Reg, but...

1611
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:51,125
It was you that said,
"If you wanna write, then make it count."

1612
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,416
- You said it was good, Dad.
- And it is.

1613
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,500
So then?

1614
01:31:55,541 --> 01:31:57,958
Hiram Lodge is the one who's building it.

1615
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:00,083
What?

1616
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,375
The <i>Gazette's</i> main source
of advertising revenue

1617
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:04,958
is Lodge Industries and Hiram.

1618
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,458
And if I print this article,
the money will stop,

1619
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:09,500
he'll shut us down.
The publication is finished.

1620
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:12,125
- He said that?
- Yes, he did.

1621
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,750
I have to look at the bigger picture, son.

1622
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:18,958
And what about the free press
Grandpa fought for?

1623
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:20,958
Did you forget about that?

1624
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:24,375
What about the social responsibility
you were saying I should take?

1625
01:32:34,291 --> 01:32:35,583
See you, Uncle Ricky.

1626
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:49,208
- I wanna talk to you.
- Not now.

1627
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:52,041
Is everything okay, Betts?

1628
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:55,791
[car horn honks]

1629
01:32:58,708 --> 01:32:59,791
She's here.

1630
01:33:01,041 --> 01:33:02,125
[car door shuts]

1631
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:05,208
Hi.

1632
01:33:05,916 --> 01:33:08,958
- Your dad's building the hotel?
- What are you talking about?

1633
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,333
- He's gonna destroy Green Park.
- No, he's not.

1634
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:13,208
He wouldn't let us run the article.

1635
01:33:14,041 --> 01:33:16,208
- He threatened my father.
- What?

1636
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,000
Did you tell him
about the article, Ronnie?

1637
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:20,125
No, why would I even mention that?

1638
01:33:21,291 --> 01:33:22,583
How dare he accuse me!

1639
01:33:23,375 --> 01:33:25,666
Your dad couldn't have heard
from anyone else.

1640
01:33:40,833 --> 01:33:42,333
He's on a call, Ronnie.

1641
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:43,916
Ronnie!

1642
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,833
[Hiram] No, no, that sounds perfect.

1643
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:50,833
In fact, I was thinking
we could announce it at Christmas.

1644
01:33:51,666 --> 01:33:52,875
I'm busy, darling.

1645
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,500
Yes.

1646
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,500
Look, I'm going to have to call you back.

1647
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,916
- No school today?
- You threatened Uncle Ricky?

1648
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:10,583
I did no such thing.

1649
01:34:10,666 --> 01:34:12,250
Why did the article not go to print?

1650
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:16,416
I merely expressed my point of view,
and Uncle Ricky did what was right.

1651
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,500
The park will get destroyed
and an ugly hotel will go in, is that it?

1652
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:22,416
Yes, because it'll help a lot of people.

1653
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,500
It'll help you.

1654
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,208
This is Green Park, Dad.

1655
01:34:27,166 --> 01:34:29,833
I can't believe you don't care
about anything besides money?

1656
01:34:29,916 --> 01:34:32,125
Excuse me, missy. Mind your step.

1657
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,333
You get to travel the world
with that money,

1658
01:34:35,416 --> 01:34:37,208
go shopping, and your partying.

1659
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:41,250
Do you have any idea how much
that watch of your costs?

1660
01:34:41,333 --> 01:34:43,750
Where do you think
the money for that comes from?

1661
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:49,000
For God's sake, Ronnie, grow up.

1662
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:51,083
At some point, you will inherit this all.

1663
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:55,541
Besides, this is business,
it's not personal.

1664
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:58,916
My friends hate me because of you.

1665
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:02,250
So I'm sorry, but it is personal.

1666
01:35:03,916 --> 01:35:05,750
Then get new friends.

1667
01:35:06,541 --> 01:35:07,833
- [scoffs]
- [door slams]

1668
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:24,833
Thank you for coming.

1669
01:35:25,833 --> 01:35:26,958
What can I do for you?

1670
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:28,458
I want to say sorry.

1671
01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:31,166
- Why is that?
- I made you upset.

1672
01:35:32,333 --> 01:35:33,625
Why are you angry, Betts?

1673
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,875
I'm not angry, I'm just sad.

1674
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:43,166
Can you please tell me why?

1675
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,708
You're my oldest friend, Betts.

1676
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:50,666
It feels really strange
when you won't even talk to me like this.

1677
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:01,791
Can you please tell me what's wrong?

1678
01:36:01,875 --> 01:36:04,041
Is this about me and Ronnie?

1679
01:36:06,916 --> 01:36:09,666
The connection you have with
Ronnie is clearly special.

1680
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,125
I really shouldn't have
tried to get involved.

1681
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,875
Ronnie can't have
a special connection with anyone.

1682
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:18,833
- That's not true.
- I'm serious.

1683
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:20,625
She only cares about herself.

1684
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:21,625
Hey, enough!

1685
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:24,208
I know she may be spoiled,
but she has a big heart.

1686
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:28,708
Reggie can think whatever he wants.
I don't believe it.

1687
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:31,166
It's impossible that she had any idea.

1688
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,000
- Really?
- Yes.

1689
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:36,791
Green Park is as important to her
as the rest of us, Archie.

1690
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,875
Don't you remember,
her tenth birthday party happened here?

1691
01:36:40,833 --> 01:36:44,416
How could I forget? It's the first time
we went on that giant wheel.

1692
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,791
And her favorite teacher?
Mrs. Pearson.

1693
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:49,666
And how much fun her class was.

1694
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:52,541
- Oh, really?
- Don't you remember?

1695
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:54,875
Here is your passport.

1696
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,541
Please be responsible with your money.

1697
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:01,083
Yes, Dad. I'll find a part-time job.
Don't worry.

1698
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:03,125
Pass exams first, okay?

1699
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,791
Hey, have you ever wanted
to leave Riverdale?

1700
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:08,000
I always wanted to stay.

1701
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,000
How are you and Uncle Ben
as different as you are?

1702
01:37:13,833 --> 01:37:16,500
Your grandfather used to ask
the same question.

1703
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:18,875
- "The" Richard Andrews?
- Yes.

1704
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,083
"The" Richie.

1705
01:37:22,083 --> 01:37:23,583
Oh, how he loved this country.

1706
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:28,000
He used to say,
"Every Englishman owes India."

1707
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:30,000
And he meant it.

1708
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,416
And when it was time to return,

1709
01:37:33,541 --> 01:37:36,125
he stayed back, to give back.

1710
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:39,666
- The travel agency did that?

1884
01:50:29,416 --> 01:50:32,791
And Master Jughead's favorite,
pork vindaloo.

1885
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:35,583
Thank you, Smithers.

1886
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:43,583
Now tell Betty and me the truth
or watch us eat dinner.

1887
01:50:43,666 --> 01:50:45,416
Archie loves you both.

1888
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
He's really confused and can't decide.

1889
01:50:47,583 --> 01:50:49,000
Who is he to decide?

1890
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:50,875
No, no, you're absolutely right.

1891
01:50:50,958 --> 01:50:52,083
He messed with us, Juggy.

1892
01:50:52,166 --> 01:50:55,000
I warned Archie when you'll find out,
it'll be bad.

1893
01:50:55,083 --> 01:50:58,083
But he wouldn't listen.
You girls are scary.

1894
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,791
- Scary?
- Yeah.

1895
01:51:00,625 --> 01:51:02,083
- Poor guy.
- Poor guy?

1896
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:05,166
Huh? It's a real problem.
He can't help himself.

1897
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:06,791
He can't live without either of you.

1898
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:09,333
That's why he wrote
both of you that Founders' Ball song.

1899
01:51:09,416 --> 01:51:10,416
- What?
- What?

1900
01:51:14,041 --> 01:51:15,875
Can I join you for dinner now?

1901
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:18,750
[door creaks open]

1902
01:51:24,375 --> 01:51:25,416
Archie.

1903
01:51:26,875 --> 01:51:28,166
Mm...

1904
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:29,750
You're having a dream.

1905
01:51:38,416 --> 01:51:40,750
And here is your nightmare.

1906
01:51:40,833 --> 01:51:42,250
[gasps]

1907
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:45,083
Ronnie?

1908
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:47,041
The last time I checked, yes.

1909
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:50,666
- I owe you a big apology.
- Yes, you do.

1910
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:52,958
I should've known
you were telling the truth.

1911
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:55,458
And we should've known
you're a world-class liar.

1912
01:51:55,541 --> 01:51:57,666
Betty, what's going on?

1913
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,000
You tell us.

1914
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:02,416
And why are you creating problems
between us, Archiekins?

1915
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:03,708
"Problems"?

1916
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:09,750
I know what this looks like,
but I've never lied.

1917
01:52:09,833 --> 01:52:11,208
I've always been honest.

1918
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:13,875
Like the time that you
wrote me that song?

1919
01:52:13,958 --> 01:52:15,708
"Va Va Voom" was for Betty,

1920
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:17,416
or maybe me?

1921
01:52:18,958 --> 01:52:19,958
Jughead told you?

1922
01:52:20,083 --> 01:52:21,791
[both chuckle]

1923
01:52:21,875 --> 01:52:23,250
- True friend.
- What?

1924
01:52:23,791 --> 01:52:26,916
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know, I really like both of you.

1925
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,166
That's so sweet.

1926
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:30,958
I'm really sorry.
I don't want to hurt either of you.

1927
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:33,666
Great. 'Cause we don't want to hurt
each other either.

1928
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:36,291
Betts and I won't let
anyone split us up.

1929
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,541
It's just not worth it.

1930
01:52:38,625 --> 01:52:40,083
You saying I'm not worth it?

1931
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:41,458
Sort of.

1932
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:43,208
We're one big gang, Arch.

1933
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:45,250
And you're the most perfect
best friend, too.

1934
01:52:46,166 --> 01:52:48,416
We should keep it at that.
Don't you think?

1935
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,208
Better for everyone.

1936
01:52:50,291 --> 01:52:54,000
- Don't look so heartbroken.
- He'll be fine.

1937
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:56,166
"Hearts don't break," right?

1938
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:57,583
"They just fracture."

1939
01:52:58,166 --> 01:52:59,750
And "Time heals everything"?

1940
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:00,833
Yeah.

1941
01:53:01,416 --> 01:53:03,083
Use different lines, Archiekins!

1942
01:53:03,166 --> 01:53:04,208
Bye.

1943
01:53:04,291 --> 01:53:07,250
Oh, and don't try this again.
Or else we'll kill you.

1944
01:53:07,333 --> 01:53:09,541
[Betty] See you
at the park meeting tomorrow.

1945
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:11,500
You just got popped, Andrews.

1946
01:53:12,875 --> 01:53:13,875
[sighs]

1947
01:53:18,416 --> 01:53:19,708
Here you go. Here.

1948
01:53:27,666 --> 01:53:30,000
- Hi, Ronnie.
- Hi.

1949
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:31,833
- Hi.
- [Ethel] Welcome back.

1950
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:36,041
Hey.

1951
01:53:38,625 --> 01:53:40,166
I'm sorry.

1952
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:43,375
And I'm Ronnie.
Nice to meet you.

1953
01:53:45,208 --> 01:53:46,666
[Reggie] We came to visit.

1954
01:53:46,750 --> 01:53:47,583
Hi.

1955
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:48,708
Betts.

1956
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:51,458
Thanks for sparing his life.

1957
01:53:51,541 --> 01:53:52,875
Don't be weird, Juggy.

1958
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:55,875
You have done more than enough, Jughead.

1959
01:53:55,958 --> 01:53:57,791
[laughs] True friend!

1960
01:53:59,083 --> 01:54:00,000
Come, sit.

1961
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:02,333
So, how's it going?

1962
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:05,333
Final count, 1200 signatures.

1963
01:54:05,958 --> 01:54:06,833
[sighs]

1964
01:54:06,916 --> 01:54:08,458
We're still 3300 short.

1965
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:12,250
- That's it. We're out of time.
- [Veronica] She's right.

1966
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:13,625
My mother told me that

1967
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:16,500
on Monday, at the park,
the work will start.

1968
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,500
[Jughead] That means
we only have 4 days left.

1969
01:54:18,583 --> 01:54:20,833
[Ethel] That's not even half
the number we needed.

1970
01:54:20,916 --> 01:54:23,958
[Reggie] We should go door to door.
Get every adult signature we can.

1971
01:54:24,041 --> 01:54:26,708
[Dilton] I mean, we have to do something.
We can't give up.

1972
01:54:26,791 --> 01:54:28,916
I... I may have an idea.

1973
01:54:29,625 --> 01:54:30,916
There are two types of adults.

1974
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,958
Young adults
and the ones trying to be young.

1975
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:36,916
- I think we can draw them in.
- [Dilton reading]

1976
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,375
- Meaning?
- Meaning we should

1977
01:54:38,458 --> 01:54:40,000
invite all the adults to one place.

1978
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:42,041
You know what? We can have a fest.

1979
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:44,000
- I love fests.
- Yes!

1980
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:45,375
Should we do it at the park?

1981
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:47,250
How do we invite everyone?

1982
01:54:47,333 --> 01:54:50,416
We'll have the same problem
of not reaching enough people.

1983
01:54:57,625 --> 01:54:59,041
[Dilton] Edison once said,

1984
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:01,083
"The successful person is one who

1985
01:55:01,166 --> 01:55:04,708
even after 1000 failures,
he still gives it a try, once more."

1986
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:10,000
And did Edison also say how we can get
thousands of people to hear our message?

1987
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,875
Yeah, he did. The radio.

1988
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:17,750
- Edison invented the radio.
- No, that was Marconi. But who cares!

1989
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:19,416
Let's use the radio.

1990
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:21,791
- Moose, you're a genius!
- Thanks.

1991
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:24,000
Where are you going?

1992
01:55:24,916 --> 01:55:27,458
But who's going to let us on Akashvani?

1993
01:55:27,541 --> 01:55:29,166
Who said anything about Akashvani?

1994
01:55:29,958 --> 01:55:31,500
We can try Dilton-vani.

1995
01:55:31,583 --> 01:55:32,583
Come!

1996
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:36,416
- What is "Dilton-vani"?
- Let's go.

1997
01:55:38,625 --> 01:55:41,375
[Dilton] Now we just have to see
if it actually works.

1998
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:43,541
You made a radio?

1999
01:55:43,625 --> 01:55:45,416
[Ethel] Is this for real?

2000
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,833
Oh, it's a radio.

2001
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:50,625
You only told Moose about it?

2002
01:55:51,625 --> 01:55:52,625
Duh.

2003
01:55:52,708 --> 01:55:53,791
This is legal, right?

2004
01:55:54,583 --> 01:55:55,708
Mm-mm.

2005
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:59,083
Come on, Hedy Lamarr.
Show us your stuff.

2006
01:56:01,208 --> 01:56:02,958
- [electricity crackling]
- [exclaims]

2007
01:56:03,041 --> 01:56:04,041
Whoa.

2008
01:56:04,083 --> 01:56:05,083
Dilly!

2009
01:56:05,166 --> 01:56:06,583
[radio static]

2010
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:17,416
<i>Godrej Cinthol Soap.
India's only deodorant soap.</i>

2011
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,083
[radio interference]

2012
01:56:19,166 --> 01:56:20,291
[beatboxes]

2013
01:56:20,375 --> 01:56:23,625
Good morning, Riverdale!
I am here as your Secret Santa.

2014
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:26,375
I'm aware I'm a little late,
but you know what they say,

2015
01:56:26,458 --> 01:56:28,750
"Better to be Mr. Late
than a late mister."

2016
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:30,041
[guffaws]

2017
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:31,833
No, but seriously, folks.

2018
01:56:31,916 --> 01:56:34,416
I am sure that by now
you're all aware

2019
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,291
that Green Park's future
is in jeopardy.

2020
01:56:36,375 --> 01:56:38,166
But some kids just won't have it.

2021
01:56:38,250 --> 01:56:41,458
With us here now is 17-year-old
Archie Andrews of Riverdale High.

2022
01:56:41,541 --> 01:56:43,291
<i>Archie, what did you wish to say?</i>

2023
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:50,750
Hello, everybody.
I'm Class of 1964.

2024
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:54,291
And what I'd like to say is
just talking about it isn't going to help.

2025
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:58,041
<i>The time has come for us
to come together as one and take action.</i>

2026
01:56:58,125 --> 01:57:02,416
[Jughead] <i>So, Archie, as you said,
everyone must unite and take action.</i>

2027
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:04,291
Tell us where do we meet up?

2028
01:57:04,875 --> 01:57:05,875
Green Park.

2029
01:57:06,916 --> 01:57:08,250
"You're officially invited

2030
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:11,958
to the jammiest of jam sessions
on the sunniest of Sundays on the 30th."

2031
01:57:12,041 --> 01:57:13,375
[all chuckling]

2032
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,958
"Music, food, games, love,
and most importantly, free entry!"

2033
01:57:20,041 --> 01:57:24,458
<i>"But all kids must each be
accompanied by an adult."</i>

2034
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:27,916
<i>We only have four days left. And then,
construction begins in the park.</i>

2035
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,208
<i>These trees are the story
of our past generations.</i>

2036
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:34,000
<i>If we forget our story,
then who are we?</i>

2037
01:57:34,583 --> 01:57:38,666
<i>You need to protect our park,
for yours and your children's futures.</i>

2038
01:57:39,458 --> 01:57:41,083
Be there if you care!

2039
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:46,208
[all cheering]

2040
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:47,291
Well done!

2041
01:57:48,250 --> 01:57:49,458
Dilly, you genius.

2042
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:50,583
Thank you!

2043
01:57:50,666 --> 01:57:52,833
[all] Thank you!

2044
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:21,000
[birds chirping]

2045
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:26,166
[loud rumbling]

2046
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:07,625
[man on megaphone] Unlock the park gates
now or you will be in trouble.

2047
02:00:07,708 --> 02:00:11,625
I said open up the gates.
Don't just stand there, come on.

2048
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,666
You don't want to go to jail, do you?

2049
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:17,916
If you all don't get up,
I'm going to put all of you in jail.

2050
02:00:18,958 --> 02:00:19,958
Let's go.

2051
02:00:27,333 --> 02:00:29,458
[Dawson] How did they know
we'd be here a day early?

2052
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:33,000
Good call, Miss Lodge,
making us spend the night.

2053
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,166
Evacuate the premises!
This is a Council order.

2054
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:38,500
Let the games begin.

2055
02:00:39,958 --> 02:00:41,500
Save the green!

2056
02:00:41,583 --> 02:00:43,083
[all] Save the green!

2057
02:00:43,166 --> 02:00:47,208
Save the green! Save the green!
Save the green!

2058
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:48,541
No, quiet down.

2059
02:00:48,625 --> 02:00:50,958
- Save the green!
- [Dawson] This needs to stop.

2060
02:00:51,041 --> 02:00:52,333
Save the green!

2061
02:00:52,416 --> 02:00:54,791
Hey, quiet down! Silence!

2062
02:00:54,875 --> 02:00:57,666
Save the green! Save the green!

2063
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:58,750
Silence!

2064
02:00:58,833 --> 02:01:01,916
Save the green! Save the green!

2065
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,083
- This is public property!
- Save the green!

2066
02:01:04,166 --> 02:01:09,125
Open the gates now and evacuate
the premises, in five minutes.

2067
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:11,833
This is a Council order.

2068
02:01:11,916 --> 02:01:13,875
Excuse me! Please!

2069
02:01:13,958 --> 02:01:15,833
Excuse me. Thank you.

2070
02:01:15,916 --> 02:01:18,500
- Save the green! Save the green!
- Excuse me.

2071
02:01:18,583 --> 02:01:21,625
Save the green! Save the green!

2072
02:01:21,708 --> 02:01:23,708
Save the green! Save the green!

2073
02:01:23,791 --> 02:01:25,125
For crying out loud!

2074
02:01:25,791 --> 02:01:27,958
You let her stay out here all night?

2075
02:01:28,041 --> 02:01:30,250
Have you ever tried to stop her, Hiram?

2076
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:33,041
She's your daughter, after all.

2077
02:01:34,125 --> 02:01:38,708
Save the green! Save the green!

2078
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:40,541
Mrs. Lodge.

2079
02:01:40,625 --> 02:01:41,625
Mr. Lodge.

2080
02:01:42,125 --> 02:01:43,625
Sorry for these nuisance kids.

2081
02:01:43,708 --> 02:01:45,583
I will order the police
to force them all out.

2082
02:01:45,666 --> 02:01:47,291
You will do no such thing.

2083
02:01:48,083 --> 02:01:50,708
But they will collect petitions,
Mrs. Lodge.

2084
02:01:50,791 --> 02:01:53,416
What will happen if they hit the target?

2085
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,416
Then I will lose the land
and you your donation.

2086
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:56,833
Precisely!

2087
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:58,375
Back off, Dawson.

2088
02:01:58,458 --> 02:02:02,666
Nothing will happen.
They'll never collect enough signatures.

2089
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:05,958
- Save the green! Save the green!
- Let them have their day.

2090
02:02:06,041 --> 02:02:11,833
Save the green! Save the green!

2091
02:02:11,916 --> 02:02:16,333
Save the green! Save the green!
[all cheering]

2092
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:26,291
[Jughead]
Anything in exchange for signatures!

2093
02:02:26,375 --> 02:02:27,750
Four signatures per burger.

2094
02:02:27,833 --> 02:02:30,708
Yeah, all you want is a soda?
That is just one signature.

2095
02:02:32,208 --> 02:02:33,958
Two signatures for that, sir.

2096
02:02:34,041 --> 02:02:35,083
Come on!

2097
02:02:35,166 --> 02:02:37,250
[overlapping chatter]

2098
02:02:37,333 --> 02:02:38,375
[bell dings]

2099
02:02:38,458 --> 02:02:42,541
Wonderful! Okay. Who's next?
Three tries for three signatures.

2100
02:02:42,625 --> 02:02:45,666
Come, light up the bulb!
Let's see how strong you are.

2101
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:47,166
[woman] It's your lucky day.

2102
02:02:48,875 --> 02:02:52,625
Every item is marked.
That's five signatures, that's eight.

2103
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:54,708
- And that's ten.
- Ten?

2104
02:02:54,791 --> 02:02:57,333
You want more style?
Get more signatures.

2105
02:02:57,416 --> 02:02:58,875
- Go, go!
- Mom!

2106
02:02:58,958 --> 02:03:01,750
[Ethel] Who wants a makeover?
Cut your hair. Or style your hair.

2107
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:04,375
Spin the wheel and get a new look
for five signatures!

2108
02:03:04,458 --> 02:03:05,666
You look great!

2109
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:07,666
- Looking good, Aunty Alice!
- Thank you, Ethel.

2110

[Betty] One signature for a cookie,
two for a brownie,

2111
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:12,250
and three signatures
for a slice of cake.

2112
02:03:12,333 --> 02:03:14,875
- How is it going, my Betts? Yeah?
- Good.

2113
02:03:16,083 --> 02:03:18,708
This is comfort food
in your comfort place.

2114
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:20,208
Would you like some cake?

2115
02:03:26,375 --> 02:03:28,083

2116
02:03:28,166 --> 02:03:29,625
Wow! So strong!

2117
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:32,583
[Reggie] Sign the petition.
Ask a question.

2118
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:34,625
{\an8}Get a punchline.

2119
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:38,041
{\an8}[woman] Why are horses so strong?

2120
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:42,250
Because they live in
a stable environment!

02:03:42,333 --> 02:03:43,583
[all laughing]

2122
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:45,291
Knock-knock.

Who's there?

2124
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:52,500
Yam.

2125

Yam who?

2126
02:03:56,333 --> 02:03:57,791
Yeah, I am very, very sorry.

2128
02:04:03,541 --> 02:04:04,916
Ladies and gentlemen,

2129
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,916
please give this corny joke some love.

2130
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,708
[applause]

2131
02:04:11,375 --> 02:04:12,791
Mango orchard? Mary will show you.

2132
02:04:12,875 --> 02:04:14,416
This way to the mango orchid.

2133
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:15,875
The mango orchard, everyone. Yeah?

2134
02:04:15,958 --> 02:04:17,638
- Mary is right there.
- The mango orchard.

2135
02:04:17,708 --> 02:04:19,916
[Mary] We have to get
as many petitions as possible.

2136
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,666
I'm so proud of you guys.

2137
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:26,375
How many times do I have to tell you
these books don't sell?

2138
02:04:26,458 --> 02:04:27,625
Put them in the back room.

2139
02:04:45,708 --> 02:04:46,791
You're an hour late.

2140
02:04:47,791 --> 02:04:48,875
Sorry about that.

2141
02:04:48,958 --> 02:04:50,958
We'll keep bringing you more
as they come in.

2142
02:04:51,041 --> 02:04:52,208
You have till 5:00 p.m.

2143
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,666
Please count them carefully.

2144
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:57,500
Not a single signature will be missed.

2145
02:04:58,250 --> 02:04:59,291
Thank you.

2147
02:05:07,708 --> 02:05:10,125
Thank you so much for coming here today.

2148
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:12,875
You've seen the Archies perform before.

2149
02:05:12,958 --> 02:05:16,250
But today we have some new band members.

2150
02:05:17,333 --> 02:05:19,916
Friends who inspired the song,
we're gonna sing for you today.

My father once told me to make art
one has to go in, not out.

2164
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:56,083
If, like us, you happen to want
this park to stay protected,

2165
02:05:56,625 --> 02:05:59,125
it's absolutely critical
the petition goes through.

Ladies and gentlemen,

02:06:01,125 --> 02:06:03,416

02:11:53,458 --> 02:11:56,750
<i>The next day was New Year's Eve.
It was a cold morning.</i>

2232
02:11:57,458 --> 02:12:00,583
<i>We were all waiting
for the results of the vote.</i>

2233
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:04,875

2234

<i>The next stop
was Station Master Doiley's house.</i>

Dilly.

2236
02:12:15,125 --> 02:12:17,666
<i>Dilton's illegal radio had to be seized.</i>

2237
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:19,958
<i>But he was allowed one final announcement.</i>

2238
02:12:20,041 --> 02:12:23,958
We have received the total numbers
for Green Park's petition...

2239
02:12:24,041 --> 02:12:27,875
<i>Dilly flipped on the mic and everyone
raised the volume of their radios.</i>

2240
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:31,583
<i>And Dilton-vani was heard
in every home in town.</i>

2241
02:12:31,666 --> 02:12:34,625
<i>The message was loud and clear,
just like the citizens of Riverdale.</i>

2242
02:12:34,708 --> 02:12:39,833
The town has been louder and clearer
than we could've ever imagined.

2243
02:12:39,916 --> 02:12:43,375
[Archie] <i>"Save the green"
got 5600 signatures!</i>

2244

<i>And no one was gonna cut down our trees.</i>

2245
02:12:46,666 --> 02:12:48,458
<i>Our history would remain untouched.</i>

2246

2247
02:12:50,583 --> 02:12:53,416

was revoked.</i>

2248

2249
02:12:56,666 --> 02:13:01,750

02:13:04,291 --> 02:13:06,791

2254
02:13:12,041 --> 02:13:13,500
You cheeky kids.

2255
02:13:13,583 --> 02:13:15,125

2256
02:13:15,208 --> 02:13:17,041

02:13:25,625 --> 02:13:29,416
<i>He saw himself in Veronica,
and found his victory in her success.</i>

2261
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:32,833

no one is too young to change the world.
