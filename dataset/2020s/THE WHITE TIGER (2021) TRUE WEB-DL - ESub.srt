So, Balram,
do you know what the Internet is?

392
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,291
No, sir, but I could drive

Yes, sir. Books.
I always loved books, sir.

Have you ever seen a computer?

-[Pinky] Come on, Ashok.

Our future is China. They're building
superhighways, they need coal,

426

and we sell coal.

427
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,666

No, sir. I learned from Ashok Sir,
the Internet is as real as a spider's web,

431
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:43,125
that it connects
all the human beings across--

-[in Hindi] Know what that was for?
-Yes, sir.

434
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:49,166
-For the Internet, sir.
-Hey!

You're pressing it too hard.
Papa is getting annoyed. Slow down.

[The Stork] Hmm.

437
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,666
[Ashok] Why do you hit the servants?

438
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,916
In America, they can sue you for that.

[speaking Hindi]

818
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:15,583
My grandson is a very big man!

819
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:21,083
But he forces his Granny
to do all his work for him.

820
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:25,541
This is the fate
of an old woman in this world.

821
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,333
[Balram in English] <i>I wanted to bring him</i>
<i>to Delhi and save him from all this.</i>

822
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,166
[in Hindi] Eat the chicken.

823
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,791
I made it myself.

824
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:43,000
You haven't had any like it in ages.

825
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,875
Ashok Sir is a vegetarian.

826
00:47:47,166 --> 00:47:50,291
America made him completely lose his mind.

827
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,625
[Balram] I'm thinking of doing the same.

828
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,083
What? Are you a Brahmin?

829
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,416
Eat. You've gotten so thin.

830
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,833
A body should be filled out for marriage.

831
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,333
-Whose marriage?
-Yours!

832
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:05,583
We found a girl for you.

833
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:09,500
You'll be married by the end of the year.

834
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:17,125
I need time. I'm not ready to get married.

835
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:18,500
[Kusum] Not ready?

836
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,625
Just eat the chicken.

837
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,375
I don't want to get married.

838
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:28,583
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the family.

839
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,458
Eat.

840
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,666
[speaks in Hindi]

841
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,916
-You're not Ashok Sir.
-Did you not understand?

842
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,083
Are you going to force me?
I don't want to get married!

843
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,166
You're driving me insane.

844
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:41,625
[Kishan] Munna!

845
00:48:44,166 --> 00:48:46,416
Where are you going? Stop!

846
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:48,333
What happened?

847
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:51,583
-You must keep sending money.
-I won't send it.

848
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,041
That's the family's money!

849
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:57,541
She's sucked the blood
out of you and left you a shell.

850
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,875
And she'll leave you to die, like Dad.

851
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,375
[Ashok in English] Why don't I eat meat?
Why does Pinky wear pants?

852
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,458
Why don't we have kids? They won't stop.

853
00:49:24,541 --> 00:49:26,625
[Balram] I think
we should not go back there, sir.

854
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:27,958
[Ashok] Maybe.

855
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,625
[distant mooing]

856
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:33,041
You know, one in every three buildings
in India is built in Bangalore.

857
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:34,458
You know why?

858
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,625
-Outsourcing with the US.
-[Balram] Diversifying, sir?

859
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,625
[Ashok] Yeah, right. Not bad, Balram.

860
00:49:41,708 --> 00:49:42,666
[Balram chuckles]

861
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,916
I'm thinking to offer financial services.

862
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,791
There's so many Wall Street firms I know.

863
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:52,458
I can drive you
to Bangalore right now, sir.

864
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:54,666
-Right now?
-Yes, sir.

865
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,250
-It's on the opposite side of the country.
-It's okay, sir.

866
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,416
I don't need sleep. I can drive all night.

867
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,125
No, thank you.

868
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,208
I got to make a business plan first.
Do it the right way.

869
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,208
You will, sir. You will.

870
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:10,250
Yes. I will.

871
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:12,541
-[Pinky] Ashoky!
-Yeah?

872
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:16,583
[Balram] <i>If only Mr. Ashok</i>
<i>was a real entrepreneur,</i>

873
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:19,333
<i>if only we had left for Bangalore</i>
<i>that very day,</i>

874
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,583

877
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,250
<i>But a poor man?</i>

878
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:43,416
Feels like, "Are we gonna go back home,
or does he want to stay here?"

879
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,291
You need to talk. Put your foot down.

880
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,833
Yeah, but he's not had
that conversation with me.

881
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:50,583
I think he's being vague
because he hasn't figured it out--

882
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:52,916
Balram! What are you doing?

883
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,291
-Your ginger teas, madam?
-With your hand.

884
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:56,875
[in Hindi] What's he doing?

885
00:50:56,958 --> 00:50:58,791
[woman in English]
Pinky, this is disgusting.

886
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:02,000
Your uniform is filthy and your mouth
smells of that <i>paan </i>all day. Just…

887
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:04,625
Ugh! Just pick up this tea and leave.

888
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,833
-[in Hindi] Bring another cup.
-Madam.

889
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:08,250
After you wash your hands.

890
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,583
[Pinky in English]
He's not usually like that. I'm sorry.

891
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:13,125
[woman] These lower castes, <i>na,</i>
they're all the same.

892
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,458
-See you soon.
-[Pinky] Keep visiting, okay?

893
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:17,833
-[woman] Talk to Ashok, yeah?
-I will. Bye.

[Pinky] Come here, please.

-Come here.
-Madam, I'm really sorry. I will stop.

897
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:32,416
-It's fine. Sit. Sit.
-I will stop eating <i>paan, </i>madam.

898
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,041
No. That's not what I'm… Just sit down.

899
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,416
I think it's wrong
the way you work for us.

900
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,708
You should be finishing your education,
starting your own family.

901
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,875
Ashok Sir and you are family to me, madam.

902
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:47,333
-Don't say that. That's not true, Balram.
-Really, madam.

903
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:49,833
No, you can't possibly believe that.

904
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:54,750
Do you know what my parents do in America?

905
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,541
They run this shitty little bodega
in Jackson Heights,

906
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,291
selling beer, <i>paan, </i>and porn.

907
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,500
I used to do my homework in the basement.

908
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:05,208
One night I saw my mom
being held at gunpoint,

909
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:07,458
and she still finished
working the entire night.

910
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,500
I got out, Balram.

911
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,625
What is it that you want to do?

912
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,583
-I want to serve you and Ashok Sir.
-No.

913
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,166
-Okay, stop. No.
-Really, madam.

914
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,958
Stop saying that. That's why this
caste system thing is total bullshit.

915
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,458
You know, Mukesh tried
to stop Ashok from marrying me

916
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,291
because of this caste thing.

917
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:29,416
Well, fuck him.

918
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,166

-A hundred rupees sale!

My Granny says if you believe in God,
then good things will happen.

Why are you so kind to me, Balram?

1309

It is my duty, sir.

1310
01:20:51,125 --> 01:20:53,250
Sir, I made some <i>nimbu pani </i>for you.

1311

You know, my mom,

1334
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,833
she was the one who encouraged me
to go to America and study.

1335
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:47,458
Pinky really loved her.

1336
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:59,041
You know, sir, Pinky Madam told me
that you are a great man

1337

great things in India, sir.

1338

-When did she say that?
-The morning she left.

1339
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,083
She was crying the entire way
to the airport, sir. [clicks tongue]

1340
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,375
And she told me that you will not
let Mukesh sir tell you what to do.

1341
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:16,583
And that she believes in you.

Yeah.

1345
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,708
She's coming back. I can feel it.

1346
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:43,666

She said that?

1353
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:32,625
-Don't worry. I'm handling it.
-[Ashok] You're probably happy she's gone.

1354
01:25:32,708 --> 01:25:35,541

I want your happiness, <i>bhai.</i>

-Wait, stop. Ashok.

-No, I need to talk to her--
-You can't call her like this.

1357

Stop pleading like this. You'll regret it.

1358
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:50,333
The only thing I regret
is letting her drive that night.

1359

-[Mukesh] It's not your fault. You know.
-It is my fault.

Nice and hot okra.

-[in English] I don't want food right now.
-Just like we had the other night, sir.

1366

learned anything, you idiot?

1384
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:21,333
If she thought she owed you 10,000,
she truly owed you ten times more.

1385
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:24,833
Ten times more. No! A hundred times more.
A hundred times more.

[panting]

1387
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,666
They made me sign that confession,
and I asked for nothing in return.

Why did I not ask?
I didn't even think to ask.

1389

Eyes.

1392
01:27:50,291 --> 01:27:53,083
As long as you have eyes, you'll work.

1393
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:56,541
But when you turn 50-55,
they'll kick your ass out.

1394

And then?

01:27:59,083 --> 01:28:01,916
If you've saved some money,
you can buy a little shack.

1396

But if you're clever like me
and earn extra money, then maybe more.
