67
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,250
No siblings.
I've already made all the inquiries.

68
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,208
The first mother had three husbands,
and the first father had two wives.

69

Yes?

81
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,041
Whose bag is this?

82
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,208
No idea.
A customer must have left it behind.

- Some other day.
- Glory to Lord Mahakaal.

88

SHIVKALYAN HOUSING COMMITTEE

Shambhu!

95
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,541
Shambhu!

96
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,000
Damu.

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,625
Damu.

98
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,166
Get me a cup of tea.

99
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,791
Dear, first get me a glass of water.

100
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,541
Oh, Lord Shiva!

101
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:55,375
I've been telling you that she
has gone to Sanya's place to study,

102
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,541
and yet you wouldn't
stop chanting her name!

103
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,208
When did you say that?
I didn't hear it.

104
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,833
Had you ever listened to me,

105
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,125
you would have been somewhere else!

106
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,750
Sit.

107
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,958
Even hotels take some time
to prepare the order.

108
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,583
Vivek.

109
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,541
He has gone over to Zaheer's place
to study.

110
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,875
He'll be staying there tonight.

111
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,208
What are you doing, Dad?

112
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,166
- Dad...
- This doesn't seem to fit.

113
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,458
You need to check
for male and female first.

114
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,458
What?

115
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,791
Male cord. Female slot.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,916
How will it fit?

117
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,208
It will break, right?

118
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,541
Go on.

119
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,250
Go and ask Vivek.
He has got one.

120
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,375
Whose bag is this?

121
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,291
A customer left it at the shop.
Keep it on the loft.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,916
Go on.

123
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,666
Hey, bring my tea to the porch.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,250
As you wish, my lord.

125
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,291
After that, you can visit
Khajuraho and Omkareshwar.

126
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,875
Then Harsidhi Mata.

127
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,041
Next Kaal Bhairav.

128
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,375
Only alcohol is offered
to the deity there.

129
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,625
Okay?

130
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,583
Wait a second.

131
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,625
What happened?

132
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,041
How?

133
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:04,708
I'm coming.

134
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,375
Chandu will explain everything else.

135
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:07,583
- I will guide you.
- Which hospital?

136
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,166
- Vivek!
- Mom, calm down!

137
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,416
Look, Dad is here.

138
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,125
What happened?

139
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,416
What happened, Indu?

140
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,000
What happened?!

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,875
Be quiet!

142
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,083
- Where is Vivek?
- Uncle, he has been admitted.

143
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,125
- Admitted?
- Dad, no one's telling us anything.

144
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,708
The doctor said he wants to talk to you.

145
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,250
Me? Where is Vivek?

146
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,625
No... Where is the doctor?

147
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,458
- Calm down! Sit!
- Come on, Mom.

148
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,958
Wait. You cannot go inside.

149
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,125
I cannot go inside?!

150
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,708
He can't go inside!

151
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,833
- There's a patient inside.
- Oh, there's a patient inside!

152
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,666
- Mom...
- My son is also a patient!

153
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,125
Well, I used protection.

154
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,875
But my wife still got pregnant.

155
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,666
What kind of protection?

156
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,250
It had dots on it.

157
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,666
Dots?

158
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,083
Yeah... it had a fancy name.

159
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,458
Let me explain.

160
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,250
Once a hunter

161
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,083
mistakenly took an umbrella
instead of his gun to hunt a lion.

162
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,125
I see.

163
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,291
He came across a lion on the way.

164
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,166
He pointed the umbrella
like a gun and fired... bang!

165
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,291
The lion was dead.

166
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,458
You must be joking, doctor!

167
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,708
How can someone kill a lion
with an umbrella?

168
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,500
Someone else must have fired.

169
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,541
Exactly my point.

170
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,125
Someone else must have fired.

171
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,041
That's why...

172
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:31,750
Take care.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Bloody quack! Son of a gun!

174
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,208
He calls himself a doctor!

175
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,666
Let's go home. We need to talk.

176
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,625
Come on!

177
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,916
Excuse me, doctor.

178
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,666
Come in, please.

179
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,208
Hope you don't chew betel leaf.

180
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,458
I'm Vivek's father.

181
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,875
What's wrong with him?

182
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,291
- Nothing at all.
- Nothing?

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,083
Then why was he admitted?

184
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,416
And why did you want to see me?

185
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,541
- Is it anything serious?
- Don't worry.

186
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,291
{\an8}It's nothing serious.

187
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,041
{\an8}Please... drink some water.

188
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,541
{\an8}This is a cheap, local Ve-gra.

189
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:20,833
What is it?

190
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,958
{\an8}Let me explain.

191
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,875
{\an8}- Yes.
- Mr. Kanti, these pills...

192
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,625
{\an8}help you stay awake all night.

193
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,625
Oh! I get it, sir.

194
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,250
Vivek is a very good kid.
He's a diligent student.

195
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,875
{\an8}- So, to stay awake all night...
- No.

196
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,166
{\an8}This has nothing to do with studies.

197
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,583
{\an8}It just keeps you awake all night.

198
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,250
How will he study if he's not awake?

199
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,916
{\an8}People use this...

200
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,833
{\an8}to experience long-lasting pleasures.

201
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,625
{\an8}Really long!

202
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,541
Get it?

203
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,083
{\an8}One pill does the trick.

204
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,416
Get it?

205
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,875
Who are you talking about, sir?

206
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:01,958
{\an8}Vivek.

207
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,416
{\an8}His friend Zaheer brought him to me.

208
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
{\an8}Vivek used three pills.

209
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,416
{\an8}And he kept going all night.

210
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,083
{\an8}He kept masturbating.

211
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:13,583
Mast... what?

212
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,625
Masturbate.

213
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,000
Selfie.

214
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,875
Masturbating. Like this.

215
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,750
Oh, Lord!

216
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,833
My son would never do that, sir.

217
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,208
He...

218
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,916
kept doing it till he fainted.

219
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,625
Zaheer was terrified.
So, he brought him to me.

220
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,458
- Does my wife know of this?
- No.

221
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,458
She doesn't know.
That's why I called you.

222
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,875
Where is Vivek?

223
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,208
{\an8}He's in the ward.

224
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,500
{\an8}Resting.

225
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:42,958
He's a bit drowsy.

226
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,083
Mr. Kanti.

227
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,875
Yes?

228
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,083
You don't have to worry.

229
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,541
Every child at his age does it.

230
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,791
- This is nothing new.
- Can I see him?

231
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,958
{\an8}Absolutely. He isn't sick.

232
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,375
{\an8}You can see him.

233
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,208
{\an8}You can even take him home...

234
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:05,875
{\an8}if he wants to go.

235
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,041
Why wouldn't he?

236
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,208
I'll whack him...

237
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:11,500
Mr. Kanti...

238
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,250
it's a case of masturbation.

239
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,125
Do you understand?

240
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:20,583
{\an8}Your son is aware
that you are now aware as well.

241
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,166
{\an8}Imagine...

242
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,041
{\an8}his condition.

243
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,291
Do you understand?

244
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,916
{\an8}Children experience overwhelming guilt.

245
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,875
{\an8}They feel as if...

246
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,833
{\an8}they have committed
the biggest crime in the world.

247
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,208
{\an8}A sin.

248
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,166
They don't feel like they can face anyone.

249
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:41,583
Please...

250
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,083
handle with care.

251
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,250
It's a sensitive issue.

252
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,500
You should...

253
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,625
let your family go home,

254
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,625
and you can take him home a bit later.

255
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,333
What happened?

256
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,333
- What happened to Vivek?
- Nothing. Where is Zaheer?

257
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,708
- He left.
- He left?

258
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,666
How is Vivek?

259
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,541
- What happened?
- Zaheer is so stupid.

260
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,250
It was nothing.
Vivek was awake all night studying.

261
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,041
He vomited due to acid reflux.
Zaheer got scared and rushed him here.

262
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,333
Idiot!

263
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,583
Thank God!
Hail Lord Mahadev!

264
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,791
- Check who's calling.
- Yes.

265
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,125
If it's Mona's mother,
tell her everything's alright.

266
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,625
Did you tell the whole neighborhood

267
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,375
- that you were going to the hospital?
- Hello?

268
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,125
Mom started crying over the phone.

269
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,916
The rickshaw driver was
taking us to the crematorium.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,125
He turned around when I stopped him.

271
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,666
Go home.

272
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,125
Vivek is resting.
I'll bring him home later at night.

273
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,208
Go on.

274
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:43,833
Listen.

275
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,000
If anyone asks...

276
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,000
tell them...

277
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,666
it was acid reflux.

278
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,125
Was it something else?

279
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,458
Heart attack.

280
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,500
Take her home.

281
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:57,875
Let's go.

282
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:58,875
You think it's funny!

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,208
What did Mona's mother say?

284
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:26,666
SHIVKALYAN HOUSING COMMITTEE

285
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,708
Go and lie down quietly.

286
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,958
Give me your phone.

287
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,750
- Your boy's back.
- You're right, sister.

288
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,958
- The hospital...
- These hospitals are running a scam.

289
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,791
- Are you alright?
- Good Lord!

290
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,958
He has grown weak.

291
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,333
His face has turned pale in a day.

292
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,625
It's because he's working hard.

293
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,250
- How hard...
- If you ever have acid reflux again,

294
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,583
- then eat a banana.
- Yes.

295
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,250
- You'll feel better.
- Why are you all still awake?

296
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,708
Glory to Lord Mahadev.

297
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,708
- Glory to Lord Mahadev.
- Brother!

298
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,375
- What happened to him?
- Go to bed.

299
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,041
It was nothing. Just acid reflux.

300
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,666
- What were you saying? Bananas?
- Go to bed.

301
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,291
- Yes.
- Which other fruits are beneficial?

302
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,500
- Please tell Indumati. Make a list.
- Alright.

303
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,375
- Get a book and a pen.
- My nephew had acid reflux once.

304
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,250
He ate a banana,
and he was completely normal.

305
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,083
Bananas give instant energy.

306
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,250
That's right.

307
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,166
Zaheer!

308
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:21,958
Zaheer!

309
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,500
Zaheer, over here!

310
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,083
Come here.

311
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:28,416
{\an8}PARK TIMINGS

312
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
{\an8}I need to know the truth, son.
Don't keep anything from me.

313
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,791
Otherwise, I'll call your father.

314
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,166
Go on. I won't tell anyone.

315
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,541
Do you swear on Lord Mahadev?

316
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,125
Yes.

317
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,916
We were preparing for
a salsa dance presentation at school.

318
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,708
<i>Ma'am selected Sophie
and Vivek as the lead dancers.</i>

319
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,583
<i>They were both dancing
incredibly well at the rehearsals.</i>

320
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,875
<i>But... it didn't sit well
with Romil and his friends.</i>

321
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,708
<i>- Who is Romil?
- Romil is our classmate.</i>

322
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,166
<i>He's very popular.</i>

323
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,375
- Vivek!
- Yes, ma'am.

324
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,500
- Good job.
- Thank you, ma'am.

325
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>Everyone at school says</i>

326
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,375
<i>Sophie is probably Romil's girlfriend.</i>

327
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,333
<i>So, maybe Romil played some trick.</i>

328
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,375
<i>The next day, he was dancing
with Sophie at the rehearsals.</i>

329
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,000
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

330
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,000
- Ma'am!
- Yes?

331
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,750
Ma'am, why have I been removed?

332
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,666
Wasn't I doing it properly?

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,875
You were doing it right, but Sophie
doesn't want you as her partner.

334
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
But, ma'am, how is that fair?

335
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,791
Practice with Lovina.

336
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,916
There's very little time left
for the show. Go and practice.

337
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,708
Sophie!

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,916
Please tell me,
why did you have me replaced?

339
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,500
That's none of your business, Vivek.

340
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,375
YOUR FUTURE IS IN YOUR HANDS

341
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,791
Hey, cheap Michael Jackson!

342
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,291
Show me your hand.

343
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,250
Come on.

344
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,375
Make an L.

345
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,750
It's so small!

346
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,291
- Little Willy!
- Romil, let him go!

347
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,958
- Shut up.
- Quiet.

348
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,541
Come on. Do this.

349
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,875
I told you! It's so tiny!

350
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,875
- Tiny!
- You've got a tiny one.

351
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,791
Look here.
See how big this is.

352
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,083
Look at the size!

353
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:17,916
This is why Sophie chose me.

354
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,166
My little salsa dancer!

355
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,833
Do you do it? No?

356
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,291
- Then it's never gonna grow.
- You...

357
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,583
- Shut up!
- Hey!

358
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,416
- Hey!
- Romil, leave him!

359
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,541
Hey! What?

360
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,791
Grow up, son.

361
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,291
Grow up! Get it?

362
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,625
Pull up your zipper first,
then we'll talk.

363
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,708
Shake well till it swells!

364
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,041
Shake well till it swells!

365
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,250
<i>The comments made by Romil
and his friends upset Vivek.</i>

366
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,208
<i>He was disturbed.</i>

367
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,083
<i>He came over to my place
that very night and...</i>

368
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,875
<i>checked his size.</i>

369
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,916
<i>He spent all night
researching on the computer.</i>

370
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,583
Romil was right.

371
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,333
The problem is with me.

372
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,500
What problem?

373
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,208
My size.

374
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
I must fix this.

375
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,833
Today I got rejected by Sophie.

376
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,583
Tomorrow it will be someone else.

377
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,625
Look what's written here.

378
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,416
"Small size leads to depression."

379
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,791
"Sex life is destroyed."

380
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,291
"Wife leaves you."

381
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,708
"You commit suicide."

382
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,375
I must do something.

383
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,625
I must do something.

384
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:38,916
<i>I thought I should
check my size too, but...</i>

385
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,750
<i>Vivek's condition terrified me, Uncle.</i>

386
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,291
<i>Since that day,</i>

387
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,500
<i>Vivek would always be stressed.</i>

388
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,666
<i>He would remain quiet in class as well.</i>

389
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,416
<i>Later we decided to talk to Mr. Nagdev
from the biology department.</i>

390
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,333
Sir.

391
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,458
Sir, I had a doubt.

392
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,166
Is our finger length and the size of our...

393
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,083
reproductive organ proportional?

394
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,208
Go.

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,125
Go, you shameless!

396
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,333
<i>Vivek was convinced...</i>

397
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,875
<i>that Romil and his friends were right.</i>

398
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:15,958
<i>Masturbation increases the size.</i>

399
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,833
<i>And I realized what Vivek was up to.</i>

400
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,583
I didn't know whether he was
doing the right thing or not.

401
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,083
One day, when we were
walking on the street,

402
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,583
we heard a voice.

403
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:36,166
Who wants the throne
when all you need is a hard scepter?!

404
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,875
A Popsicle will turn into a baseball bat.
A bat will turn into a flagpole.

405
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:43,666
And if your lamp is burnt out,
your neighbor will be out on the prowl.

406
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,500
This oil will make it grow fourfold!

407
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,333
You will love the outcome.

408
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,000
My word is my guarantee.

409
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,041
You have nothing to lose.
Come and get it.

410
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,083
Give me one.

411
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,583
- Sir.
- Yes?

412
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,125
He takes selfies.

413
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,875
But if you could give us some medicine
that would increase the size...

414
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,875
Of course!

415
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,125
The size will definitely grow.

416
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,791
Use this oil, and have non-stop pleasure.

417
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,541
Now pay up.

418
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,291
<i>He used ten bottles instead of one.</i>

419
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,333
<i>But there was no growth at all.</i>

420
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,583
<i>We were afraid to ask questions
to our teachers.</i>

421
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,250
<i>But Vivek spotted something
outside the classroom window.</i>

422
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,833
SHAKTIMAAN CLINIC
DR. B. D. SHAH

423
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,000
Here.

424
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,750
Wrap this around.

425
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,541
Tightly. Okay?

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,875
Will he get electrocuted?

427
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,041
His energy will show here.

428
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,625
What have you done?

429
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,291
Red bulb. Low pressure.

430
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,250
This is serious.

431
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,541
But we should be able to fix it.

432
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,750
Play with your little friend,
but use these medicines.

433
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,333
<i>But the medicines were of no help.</i>

434
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,875
<i>In fact, it just made things worse.</i>

435
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,583
<i>Vivek even stopped studying.</i>

436
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,208
<i>Most of the time
he would be in the washroom,</i>

437
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,458
<i>or he would be crying.</i>

438
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,458
<i>He'd often ask me...</i>

439
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>"Am I a bad boy?"</i>

440
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,083
<i>Romil and his friends
would tease him in school.</i>

441
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,958
So, I finally asked Romil's
friend Anup for a solution.

442
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,833
He said there's an enlargement pill
available at Inder Medical.

443
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,583
{\an8}<i>But there is a code word for it.</i>

444
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,750
{\an8}Uncle, do you have the pill
to increase one's height?

445
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:27,333
Yes...

446
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,166
Sure. We'll do as he says.
No big deal.

447
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,125
<i>Finally, he took a pill.</i>

448
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,916
<i>But he was so excited
that he felt nothing happening.</i>

449
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,416
<i>So, he took three pills together.</i>

450
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,416
<i>And then, we had to go see a doctor.</i>

451
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,000
Didn't you take a pill?

452
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:48,250
I thought I'd let Vivek experiment first,

453
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,750
and I'd do it later.

454
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,500
Who else knows about this?

455
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,041
Just the doctor.

456
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,958
Don't tell anyone else, son.

457
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,041
Have you matured beyond your years?

458
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,083
Have you?!

459
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,458
It was beyond my capacity, son.

460
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:12,666
I had to implore several people
to secure your enrollment

461
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,083
in the city's best school.

462
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,208
And what are you doing?

463
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,666
What are you doing?!

464
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,916
Promise me.

465
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,041
Promise me that you'll never do it again.

466
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:27,875
Say it, son.

467
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,666
I tried.

468
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,833
I promised myself.

469
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,708
But it didn't work.

470
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,125
Mr. Kanti.

471
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,083
It's guilt.

472
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,375
I warned you about this.

473
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,416
Try to send him back to school.

474
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,375
When he resumes his studies
and meets with his friends...

475
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,041
he will return to normal.

476
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,875
Sir, his birth chart is absolutely fine.

477
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:25,583
I don't see any adversity.

478
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,791
There is nothing to worry about.

479
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,333
This is not a physical issue.

480
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,500
It's psychological.

481
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,750
You have to treat it that way.

482
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:34,750
Try to be his friend.

483
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:37,833
Not just his father...

484
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,041
which you obviously are.

485
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:43,833
Vivek, hurry up.

486
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,666
Come on.

487
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,375
Hold on tight, son. Or you'll fall.

488
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:53,833
Get down, son.

489
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,291
Fix your hair. Go on.

490
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,958
Sir, the chairman wants to see you.

491
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,291
{\an8}Me?

492
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,708
{\an8}MAHAKAAL

493
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,250
Hail Lord Mahadev, sir.

494
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,083
Hail Lord Mahadev, Mr. Pandey.

495
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,000
He wasn't well...

496
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,416
He was...

497
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,000
- ill these past couple of days...
- Doesn't matter.

498
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,458
You might remember, Kanti,

499
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,791
he granted Vivek admission to this school
on my recommendation.

500
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,583
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

501
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,125
He...

502
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,791
is a good student.

503
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:54,416
But according to Mr. Maheshwari,
he cannot continue studying here.

504
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,458
Cannot continue studying?

505
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,041
I don't understand.

506
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,750
What happened?

507
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:01,125
Did Vivek do something wrong?

508
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,375
Mr. Makwana.

509
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,000
<i>Let's begin!</i>

510
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,708
<i>Vivek! Vivek!</i>

511
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,000
<i>Where is Vivek?</i>

512
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,916
<i>Where is my little boy? Little Willy!</i>

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,875
<i>Where is my little boy?</i>

514
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,625
<i>Vivek! Vivek!</i>

515
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,750
<i>Hey, Vivek! Where are you?</i>

516
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:21,875
<i>Where are you, Vivek?</i>

517
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,791
<i>Look there.
You will find him there.</i>

518
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,833
<i>Look!</i>

519
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,125
<i>There he is!</i>

520
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,791
<i>This is going to be fun!</i>

521
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,583
<i>Oh, no...</i>

522
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,041
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

523
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,000
<i>Stop.</i>

524
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,375
I expected you to uphold good values.

525
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,250
Your son has tarnished the reputation
not only of this school...

526
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:45,041
but of all my 32 schools in this state!

527
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,958
If you weren't recommended by him...

528
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:52,083
I would have made sure...

529
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:56,416
that your son never got
to study anywhere in this world.

530
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,833
I apologize with folded hands, sir.

531
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,250
I beg you.

532
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,250
Sir, think about it calmly.

533
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:12,291
I assure you that
this is his first and last mistake.

534
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,375
He will never do anything like this again.

535
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,083
Apologize to him right away!

536
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:17,916
Sir, show some mercy.
Don't do this to him.

537
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,208
Forgive him.
Hey! Apologize.

538
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,583
Say sorry.

539
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,291
Say that you are sorry.
We are both apologizing to you.

540
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,458
Please don't do this, sir.

541
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,166
Try to understand.

542
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,875
Sir...

543
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:32,833
Kanti.

544
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,583
Come with me.

545
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,166
Come on.

546
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,125
This way.

547
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,916
What kind of father are you?

548
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,166
Can't you keep an eye on your son?

549
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,833
Such a shameful act.

550
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,833
In school at that!

551
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,583
Disgusting.

552
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,166
This cannot be swept under the carpet.

553
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,375
You are associated with me.

554
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:59,000
You will be questioned and so will I.

555
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,291
You two should leave the city
for a few days

556
00:28:04,375 --> 00:28:05,916
until things cool down.

557
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,666
Understood? Go on.

558
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,208
Leave.

559
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,791
Come on, leave.

560
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,458
One, two, three, four.

561
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,625
One, two, three, four.

562
00:28:19,958 --> 00:28:22,583
One, two, three, four.

563
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,333
One, two, three, four.

564
00:28:25,625 --> 00:28:28,083
One, two, three, four.

565
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,375
One, two, three, four.

566
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,500
One, two, three, four.

567
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:42,458
Listen.

568
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,625
Don't tell anyone what happened.

569
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,583
<i>The river is too deep.</i>

570
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:51,708
<i>Please take a dip
close to the river bank.</i>

571
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:53,750
Mona!

572
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,041
Glory to Lord Mahadev.

573
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,166
- Mona!
- Damu.

574
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,166
Mona and Sanya already left for school.

575
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,208
Yes.

576
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,500
They did?

577
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,416
Before time?

578
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,625
Damu, you should go to school
with your brother now.

579
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:07,041
He has matured now.

580
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,458
Beyond his years.

581
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:15,208
What did you do?

582
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,875
What did you do?!

583
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,375
Damu, why didn't you go to school?

584
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,541
What did he do to mature before me?

585
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,791
Weren't you ashamed to watch it?

586
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:32,166
Really? He felt no shame doing it!
In school at that!

587
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,083
- Mom.
- She's lecturing us!

588
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,583
- What did he do in school?
- Nothing.

589
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,041
Tell her. Come on.

590
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,666
Keep quiet!

591
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:39,250
Don't make a scene!

592
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,166
Mom, tell me what happened!

593
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,291
- Tell her. Is it not your son's fault?
- That's right!

594
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:48,833
Thank God that Tanu
isn't friends with Vivek!

595
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,750
- Really?
- What are you trying to imply?

596
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,041
Stop pointing fingers at Mona!

597
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,083
- And don't you dare drag Sanya into this!
- Why are you furious?

598
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:58,208
Your boy looks so innocent,
but look at his actions!

599
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:00,541
- She pretends to be so innocent.
- What are they saying, Mom?

600
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:01,791
Tell me.

601
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,000
It's not acid reflux.

602
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,875
- The little boy has matured!
- Let's go! Come on!

603
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,125
Damu!

604
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,166
Come here!

605
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,041
What are you saying?

606
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:12,833
Here. Look at this.

607
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,541
<i>- Bholenath!
- Shambhu, Shambhu!</i>

608
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:22,666
<i>Lord, You have always blessed
me with Your benevolence.</i>

609
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:26,833
<i>But why does my son's future
seem so dark, Lord?</i>

610
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,750
<i>I'm entrusting him in Your hands.</i>

611
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,166
<i>I need Your guidance.</i>

612
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,750
<i>Please protect Vivek, Lord.</i>

613
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,916
<i>- Bholenath!
- Shambhu, Shambhu!</i>

614
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,500
<i>- Bholenath!
- Shambhu, Shambhu!</i>

615
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:46,125
<i>- Bholenath!
- Shambhu, Shambhu!</i>

616
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:50,666
<i>- Bholenath!
- Shambhu, Shambhu!</i>

617
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,041
<i>- Bholenath!
- Shambhu, Shambhu!</i>

618
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:56,750
Nandi.

619
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,083
My devotee is going to encounter
significant trouble.

620
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,416
Take someone from my Shivgan
who can help him.

621
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,708
As You wish, Lord.

622
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>Om! With my soul and heart</i>

623
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:38,083
<i>I bow to Visvesvaraya, Mahadevaya</i>

624
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:41,625
<i>Trimbakaya, Tripurantakaya</i>

625
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:47,041
<i>Trikalagnikalaya, Kalagnirudraya</i>

626
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:51,125
<i>Neelkanthaya, Mrityunjayaya</i>

627
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:55,041
<i>Sarveshvaraya, Sadashivay</i>

628
00:31:55,125 --> 00:32:00,500
<i>Shriman, Mahadevaya</i>

629
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:18,833
Glory to Lord Mahadev.

630
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,166
You knew what Vivek did.

631
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,000
What did Vivek do?

632
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:28,166
Damu?

633
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,291
Don't ask her.
She knows about it.

634
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:38,500
Indu, listen to me.
Just hear me out.

635
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,208
I will explain everything.

636
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,541
Listen, we're going to your
sister's place in Shahjahanpur.

637
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,083
It's only for a few days.

638
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,125
Let's go.

639
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,333
Come on, start packing.

640
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:50,375
I will tell you everything.

641
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:51,750
Where is Vivek?

642
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:54,625
Hail Lord Mahadev.

643
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,125
<i>- Kanti Sharan Mudgal?</i>
- Yes.

644
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,250
<i>- Vivek's father?</i>
- Yes, speaking.

645
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,791
<i>- Come down to the police station.</i>
- Why?

646
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,125
<i>- Bring a lawyer along.</i>
- Lawyer?

647
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,625
<i>A complaint has been filed
against your son.</i>

648
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,625
<i>He's at the police station.</i>

649
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,083
<i>- Come to Mahakaal Police Station.</i>
- Coming. Coming.

650
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,166
Yes, I'm coming.

651
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,083
What happened?

652
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,625
Oh, Lord!

653
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,833
What's wrong with Vivek?

654
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,375
Help us.

655
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:17,625
I'll set the entire city on fire
if you don't find my belongings!

656
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,625
Don't mistake me for a pushover!

657
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,208
You are not aware of my temper.

658
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,750
The last time when I lost my temper,
it took 13 whole days

659
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,291
- to calm me down!
- Hey!

660
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,750
Calm down and file a complaint.

661
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,541
Stop threatening us.

662
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:33,416
And don't talk rubbish about this city.

663
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,083
Lord Mahakaal is the supreme ruler here.
Understood?

664
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,000
Then tell Him to return my belongings!

665
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:39,000
Shut up!
Doesn't He have anything better to do?

666
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,750
Lalchand. Make him sit.

667
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,416
We'll take your report.

668
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:45,625
Sit down.

669
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:49,166
He looks like a vagabond.

670
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,833
{\an8}Look at this, Mr. Kanti.

671
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,416
{\an8}Your son was found with a knife.

672
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,458
Thank God the security guard caught him.

673
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:00,416
Or he would have stabbed his son.

674
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:02,041
What's his name?

675
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,333
{\an8}His name is Romil.

676
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,583
{\an8}Romil Dcosta.

677
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:07,958
He intends to press charges against
your son for attempted murder.

678
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:09,291
So...

679
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:10,958
you guys decide...

680
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,250
what is to be done.

681
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,708
- The police is...
- The police is very busy.

682
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,500
They do a lot of work while watching TV!

683
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:18,458
Quiet!

684
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,916
{\an8}Okay, fine. The guard caught him.

685
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,083
{\an8}But why did he assault him?

686
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,083
{\an8}They shouldn't have
laid a finger on him.

687
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,666
{\an8}Hello! Excuse me!

688
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,416
Do you expect us to worship him?

689
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,083
- You're a strange man!
- You guys are strange

690
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:35,333
to take the law into your own hands
by assaulting a child!

691
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,000
Section 345, 346.

692
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,416
- One plus one!
- We didn't take the law into our hands.

693
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,458
- We brought him to the law.
- I'm not here to argue.

694
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,625
- Science.
- Let's go to court.

695
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,791
- Science.
- We will argue over there!

696
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,166
Silence!

697
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,500
It's "silence", not "science".

698
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,666
Mr. Kanti Sharan Mudgal...

699
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:01,875
why does your son want to kill his son?

700
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,541
My son Vivek is a decent boy.

701
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,041
- Don't know...
- Oh, shut up! Decent, my foot!

702
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,833
We all know how decent he is.

703
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,416
- Shameless.
- Hey!

704
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,916
- I guess you haven't seen the video.
- Video?

705
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,583
What video?

706
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,791
Is it something new?
Something new on WhatsApp?

707
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,125
Let me show you.

708
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,458
No. This incident has nothing
to do with the video.

709
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:20,875
- Let me show you.
- Mr. Mudgal.

710
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:23,166
- Keep your hands off...
- You are trying to suppress evidence.

711
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,750
Let me see.

712
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,250
This...

713
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,583
{\an8}Look at this!

714
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,916
What is the boy up to?

715
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,375
Amazing.

716
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,458
Which subject is this, son?

717
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,833
Mr. Kanti Sharan.

718
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,791
This is how decent your son is!

719
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,833
He is a hardworking student.

720
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,000
Son, come here!

721
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,541
Come here.

722
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,583
I said come here.

723
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,958
I see all the qualities
of a criminal in you.

724
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,916
First, you wave a knife.

725
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:12,916
Then you wave your thing around.

726
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,375
Do you learn this at school?

727
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:15,666
You should ask the school.

728
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,416
This is your last warning.

729
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:27,875
Good catch.

730
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,541
Did you see it?

731
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,083
Dcosta...

732
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:46,291
leave the law out of this.

733
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,125
They are just kids.

734
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,000
They'll quarrel today
and patch things up tomorrow.

735
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,125
I guarantee you.

736
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,083
- He'll fall at your feet and apologize.
- Hey!

737
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:57,500
Come on.

738
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,000
Bow down and apologize.

739
00:37:01,625 --> 00:37:02,625
Come on.

740
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:05,333
Vivek.

741
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,666
Apologize.

742
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,083
Say you're sorry.

743
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,583
- Kanti...
- What are you doing?

744
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,791
Selfie's dad!

745
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:18,833
He's just a kid.

746
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,583
I'm... sorry, Uncle.

747
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,291
Sorry.

748
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,375
Do you want to hit me?

749
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,000
Go ahead.

750
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:37,500
Do you want to hit me?

751
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,833
You?

752
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:41,916
You too?

753
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,458
And you?

754
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:44,958
Come on, hit me.

755
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,041
Hit me.

756
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,333
Inspector, it's okay.

757
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,208
But you must give him a warning
before letting him go.

758
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,208
If anything happens to my son tomorrow...

759
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:11,791
anything at all...

760
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,750
he will be responsible.
Remember that.

761
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:18,833
I wonder why this city of knowledge
is filled with ignorant people, son.

762
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,041
Mister...

763
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,708
don't stick your nose
into other people's business.

764
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,541
Please tone it down.

765
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:27,500
Lalchand!

766
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,041
Go with him.

767
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:33,541
Go on.

768
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,666
Come on, mister.
Show me where you lost your bag.

769
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:38,833
Shall we?

770
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,750
Don't cry, son.

771
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,958
Lord's hand hovers over you.

772
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:50,791
Hey!

773
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,291
Good duck.

774
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,750
Such a menace!

775
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:08,583
Vivek!

776
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,000
Vivek!

777
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:11,875
Hurry up, son.

778
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,333
Vivek.

779
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,958
Come on. Hurry up.

780
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,916
Mister, move your leg a little.

781
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,250
I'm too tired.

782
00:39:49,416 --> 00:39:50,500
Move it yourself.

783
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,708
You?!

784
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,208
No greetings this time?

785
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,125
Well... take a seat.

786
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,625
So, are you headed to Shahjahanpur?

787
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,375
What?

788
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,625
It's the only train
that arrives in the morning.

789
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:29,875
What's wrong with your throat?

790
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,166
Nothing.
I had to drink someone's poison.

791
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,166
Do you...

792
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,541
do it often?

793
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:51,250
No, I... What about your belongings?

794
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:52,208
Did you find it?

795
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:55,958
Forget about my stuff
and worry about yours.

796
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,458
He won't stop.

797
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,916
Who won't stop?

798
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:03,250
Your son.

799
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:07,333
Vivek...

800
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:23,666
Vivek!

801
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:26,583
Vivek!

802
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:27,916
Vivek!

803
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,000
<i>Please maintain silence.</i>

804
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,166
<i>Bhasm Aarti will begin shortly.</i>

805
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,166
<i>Bhasm Aarti will begin shortly.</i>

806
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,250
<i>Do not make any noise.</i>

807
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,541
<i>Selfies are prohibited.</i>

808
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:14,291
<i>Hail Lord Mahakaal!</i>

809
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:17,833
<i>Please switch off your mobile phones.
Mobiles are not allowed.</i>

810
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,916
<i>Hold the hands of your kids.</i>

811
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,041
<i>Selfies are prohibited
on the temple premises.</i>

812
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:28,708
<i>Selfies are not allowed.</i>

813
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,333
<i>All devotees, please watch in silence.</i>

814
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:42,500
<i>God's devotion is going on.
Watch in silence.</i>

815
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:44,958
Thank you, mister.

816
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:47,250
What for?

817
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,416
Sticking my nose into your matter?

818
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,166
Forgive me, mister.

819
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,666
I've been a bit worried for my son.

820
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,250
You're bathing at this hour?

821
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,250
I always bathe at this hour.

822
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:05,458
Kanti, are you worried for your son
or yourself?

823
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,125
You are not a father.

824
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,416
I'm facing criticism
and humiliation in society.

825
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:15,375
You face criticism from society
only while you're alive.

826
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:18,208
They start praising you once you're dead.

827
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,625
Which school does your son study in?

828
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,666
Why? Are you curious
to know where he learned it?

829
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,166
No.

830
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:31,708
I believe he wouldn't be in this state
if the school had taught him well.

831
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,125
Do you see a hungry child over there?

832
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,458
Or a naked mother?

833
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:50,625
Not everything done in secrecy is wrong.

834
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,666
Don't blame your son for what he did.

835
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,833
But why in a school...

836
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,708
The school is responsible
for that as well.

837
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:08,875
Every person who didn't give
proper guidance to Vivek is responsible.

838
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,000
Only Lord Rama knows what
is right and what is wrong.

839
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,708
Kanti...

840
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,541
not just Rama...

841
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:22,500
even I know what's right
and what's wrong.

842
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,250
Sounds as impossible as
Ganga flowing backward.

843
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,958
Don't tell me in which
direction Ganga flows.

844
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:34,125
Do you think running away
to Shahjahanpur fix everything?

845
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,916
Is that place secluded?

846
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:37,791
Don't people living there
have mobile phones?

847
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:42,333
You think going into hiding
will erase your son's mistake?

848
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:45,583
Kanti, running away won't fix anything.

849
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:51,500
Realizing what he did wasn't wrong
will fix everything.

850
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,500
The people are responsible.

851
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,000
You all should be apologizing to him.

852
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,166
Only then he will be able

853
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,708
to hold his head high.

854
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,041
Really? And how will this be possible?

855
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:11,208
We'll say to them, "This is your fault.
We want an apology".

856
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,208
And they will agree?

857
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,208
Firstly, start with accepting
that you were wrong,

858
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:17,208
then deal with others.

859
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,541
Will an apology heal Vivek?

860
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,000
Can you make them apologize?

861
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,333
I'm not your lawyer.

862
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,375
What if you were?

863
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,666
If...

864
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,333
If I was your lawyer...

865
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,791
I would drag them to court.

866
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,083
Sue them for defamation.

867
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,000
And demand an apology.

868
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,458
Remember, Kanti.

869
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,291
This is a war.

870
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,333
To flee is wrong.

871
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:59,250
To fight is right.

872
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:06,041
Have faith.

873
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,500
You are Lord Shiva's disciple.

874
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,583
Have faith.

875
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,958
You are Lord Shiva's disciple.

876
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:14,875
He's just a kid.

877
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,375
I'm... sorry, Uncle.

878
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,041
Sorry.

879
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,125
Do you want to hit me?

880
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,833
Go ahead.

881
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,208
Do you want to hit me?

882
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,541
Sorry, son.

883
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,166
Vivek.

884
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:43,000
Vivek.

885
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:46,416
- <i>Right and wrong...</i>
- Get up. Let's go home.

886
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:50,416
-<i>It's just an illusion</i>
-We're not going to Shahjahanpur.

887
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,458
- <i>So do what...</i>
- Come, let's go. Indu.

888
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,958
<i>Your duty is</i>

889
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:06,541
<i>Turn your own destiny around</i>

890
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:08,833
Pranlal Muthuth. 11 rupees.

891
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:10,750
Dr. B. D. Shah. 21 rupees.

892
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:13,583
Inder Medical Store. 51 rupees.

893
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:16,625
Savoday Gyan International. 101 rupees.

894
00:47:17,166 --> 00:47:20,166
Have you thought about
how this will affect your son?

895
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,625
Only after accepting the truth...

896
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:24,791
will he heal.

897
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,458
- Send them the notice.

<i>You can leap mountains

{\an8}Kanti Sharan Mudgal vs. Kanti Sharan Mu...

913
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,041
Sir, there's a typing error.

914
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,708
What is it, Saini?

915
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,416
I think it's a printing mistake.

916
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,958
Why are you showing it to me?
Fix the printing mistake.

917
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,916
The applicant
and the defendant are the same.

918
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:22,208
What are you saying, Saini?

919
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,166
Kanti Sharan Mudgal.

920
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:25,708
And Kanti Sharan Mudgal.

921
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:27,541
Who is the applicant?

922
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,500
Okay, sit.

923
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,416
And who is the defendant?

924
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,625
It's him.

925
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:36,833
What is going on here?

926
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:37,833
It's him.

927
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,250
And also them.

928
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:45,625
Who are you defending?

929
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,375
Him, him, or everyone?

930
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:50,666
- No, bro... My Lord...
- Bro?

931
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,208
- What's "bro"?!
- Sorry.

932
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,708
- Sorry. I apologize.
- Mr. Bundela,

933
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:56,416
you realize you're standing in court.
It's a contempt of court.

934
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,916
- How are you behaving?
- My Lord. I'm sorry.

935
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,375
I... Please tell him
who you all are defending.

936
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:07,208
Are you here just for entertainment?

937
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,125
Sit.

938
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,041
And you?

939
00:49:16,625 --> 00:49:18,166
Who is your lawyer?

940
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,208
The Indian Railways must
pay compensation to this family.

941
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,916
The driver applied the emergency brakes,
which made him fall off his seat,

942
00:49:25,166 --> 00:49:26,625
and he broke both his arms.

943
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,458
He's their only son
and their caretaker in their old age.

944
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,916
But now, he cannot raise his hands
even to lift a book.

945
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:35,666
Imagine, My Lord.

946
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,500
- They will have to look after him...
- Don't be afraid, Bittu.

947
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,083
Do you like chocolates?

948
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:42,416
Good boy. Here.

949
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,583
Hey...

950
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:44,666
Have it.

951
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:47,125
- Hold it. Try.
- My Lord!

952
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,000
{\an8}- She is mocking the child.
- Ms. Kamini.

953
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,375
{\an8}- Just two minutes.
- He cannot raise his hands.

954
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,291
- Look, sir.
- Please. Come on, try.

955
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,333
- Say something, sir.
- Hold it.

956
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,666
- Stop her.
- Try.

957
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,041
- Ms. Kamini, please!
- Your Honor, say something.

958
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,250
- Wait.
- He cannot raise his hands.

959
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,125
I want to see the extent of the damage.

960
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:00,958
Two minutes.
Just two minutes, sir.

961
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,083
- My Lord, please stop her.
- Hold it.

962
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,333
- She is making fun of justice.
- Try. Come on.

963
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,583
Try.

964
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:06,708
- It's cruel, sir.
- Two minutes.

965
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,708
Okay, okay. I give up.

966
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:09,875
The damage is severe.

967
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,916
So, Bittu, do you like school?

968
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:16,541
What about playing?

969
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:19,875
I know you don't eat during recess.

970
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:20,875
You are busy playing.

971
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,750
What do you play?

972
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,125
Cricket?

973
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,208
Batting or bowling?

974
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:27,291
Batting.

975
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,250
Not fielding?

976
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:33,541
So, tell me, how high did you raise
your arms earlier to take a catch?

977
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,208
Whoa!

978
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:40,500
That's all, sir.

979
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,750
Your Honor,
this is a case of defamation.

980
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,750
And we're not asking for a large amount.

981
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,083
Sorry, sir. I got late.

982
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,291
I had another hearing.

983
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:50,625
Ms. Kamini.

984
00:50:50,916 --> 00:50:52,291
What a pleasant surprise!

985
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,500
What brings you to my court?

986
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:56,875
Who are you defending?

987
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:58,375
Savoday International School.

988
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,083
Belongs to my father-in-law.

989
00:51:00,416 --> 00:51:02,833
Of course.
My son Shaurya is studying there.

990
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:03,916
Oh, yeah, of course.

991
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,750
Mr. Bundela, please continue.

992
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,833
Section 499.

993
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:10,875
I can see that.

994
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:15,625
Eleven rupees. 21 rupees.
51 rupees. 101 rupees.

995
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:18,041
Along with an apology
to Lord Mahakaal.

996
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,500
What is this?
Is this a defamation case...

997
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:22,541
or an offering request?

998
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:26,458
Your Honor,
my client Kanti Sharan Mudgal's son

999
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,833
Vivek Mudgal was expelled from school
on grounds of indecency.

1000
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:35,875
But the onus falls
on their fake medicines,

1001
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,458
false hope, illegal sale of drugs,

1002
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:40,041
and negligence in education.

1003
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,000
And his improper upbringing.

1004
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,958
I demand an apology
letter from them all.

1005
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,541
Readmit the child to school,

1006
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:50,041
- and this amount...
- Sir, if you don't mind,

1007
00:51:50,125 --> 00:51:51,708
can I speak to them for two minutes?

1008
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:54,000
Yes, of course, Ms. Kamini.
Please go ahead.

1009
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,208
Thank you.

1010
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:57,083
Please. You too.

1011
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,416
Sir, you too.

1012
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:00,916
- Me?
- Yes.

1013
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:05,833
Why did she call our lawyer?

1014
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,333
Does she know him?

1015
00:52:15,375 --> 00:52:16,458
Sign here.

1016
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:19,416
I will defend all four of them.

1017
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:21,458
And here's my power of attorney.

1018
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,791
What are you doing?

1019
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,416
We cannot win this case, Kanti.

1020
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,500
She is an expert lawyer.

1021
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,416
What happened?

1022
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:35,041
She says that she will call my
daughter as a witness tomorrow,

1023
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:38,083
and ask what your son
is doing in the video.

1024
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,958
So what?

1025
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:41,208
Let her.

1026
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,333
Forgive me.

1027
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,083
Alright.

1028
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:53,208
I'm certain this case is going nowhere.

1029
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:56,208
It's literally a waste
of the court's precious time.

1030
00:52:56,291 --> 00:52:57,125
Yeah, I know.

1031
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:00,458
- It's up to you to decide.
- Sir. Sir, please.

1032
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,791
My lawyer has deserted me.

1033
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:05,791
Give me some time. I'll find
another lawyer from the premises.

1034
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,000
Do you think this a temple

1035
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,666
where you'll raise your hand
and collect offerings?

1036
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,833
The court has better things to do.
We are not sitting here for you.

1037
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We have other things to do.

1038
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,000
- We are busy.
- Then give me...

1039
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,708
Then give me
what you give everyone else.

1040
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:16,625
What?

1041
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:17,583
Next date.

1042
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,750
If the case doesn't have any substance,
I'll dismiss it.

1043
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:27,250
The court is adjourned.

1044
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,125
Thank you, sir.

1045
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,958
Let's go.

1046
00:53:36,041 --> 00:53:37,791
We won.
The case is over.

1047
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,750
What now, Kanti?

1048
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,041
- Shut up!
- Go ahead. Hit me.

1049
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,375
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

1050
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,166
- Should I teach you one?
- Sister-in-law!

1051
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,166
What are you doing?
This is no way to treat a child.

1052
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,458
She is not a child.

1053
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,958
She's a loudmouth!

1054
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,208
- She's so shameless...
- I'm not shameless. Vivek is!

1055
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:04,791
- Damu.
- You never say a word to him.

1056
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,541
No one talks to me anymore
because of him.

1057
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,708
- Sister-in-law, please!
- I don't want to be here!

1058
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,625
- Damu.
- I want to go away!

1059
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:11,541
Quiet!

1060
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,458
- I will yank out your tongue!
- Go ahead!

1061
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:15,791
You never say a word to him.

1062
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,750
- I'm the shameless one!
- Go inside.

1063
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,250
- Not a word.
- He's innocent.

1064
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:20,375
Quiet.

1065
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,750
Brother, I'll take your leave.

1066
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:46,333
These rats are a nuisance.

1072

What do they teach you at school?

1073
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,750
Tell me... Where is your bag?

1074
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,666
What do they teach?

1075
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,125
Dad...

1076
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,000
Dad...

1077
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:44,583
I'll be exposed to the world
through this case.

1078
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,875
I'll never be able to study again.

1079
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:51,625
Why are you exposing me to the world?

1080
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,083
So that you can
hold your head up high, son.

1081
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:04,750
Kanti...

1082
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:06,833
what are you doing?

1083
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:08,375
Preparing for my exam.

1084
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:22,083
<i>The earth burns, and the sky scorches</i>

1085
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,500
<i>The ocean is miles away</i>

1086
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:31,375
<i>You must walk on fire
Till you can walk no more</i>

1087
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,958
<i>Test your intentions</i>

1088
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,375
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1089
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,041
Step back.

1090
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:43,916
<i>You can leap over mountains
If you're determined</i>

1091
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,458
<i>If you make up your mind</i>

1092
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:50,916
<i>The universe can be yours</i>

1093
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,833
<i>Be prepared</i>

1094
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:55,458
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1095
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,208
<i>Be prepared</i>

1096
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,000
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1097
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,750
<i>Be prepared</i>

1098
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,583
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1099
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,416
<i>Be prepared</i>

1100
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,875
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1101
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:32,750
<i>If the stars aren't visible tonight</i>

1102
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:37,458
<i>They will be your guiding light</i>

1103
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:42,000
<i>Set your own examples</i>

1104
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,958
<i>Let your courage decide your destination</i>

1105
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,125
Is Vivek going too?

1106
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,708
I don't want to drag him.

1107
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:55,958
He will show up when he wants to.

1108
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,458
<i>You must go beyond your fears</i>

1109
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:02,166
<i>Be prepared</i>

1110
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,000
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1111
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,833
<i>Be prepared</i>

1112
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,583
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1113
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:11,375
<i>Be prepared</i>

1114
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,416
<i>The world is your battlefield</i>

1115
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,541
Case number 5398.

1116
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:23,166
Kanti Sharan Mudgal vs.
Kanti Sharan Mudgal...

1117
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,666
and others.

1118
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,166
<i>- Stand up.
- The world is your battlefield.</i>

1119
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:33,375
This place looks so clean...

1120
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,791
Why did you leave your slippers outside?

1121
00:58:38,875 --> 00:58:40,041
This is not some temple...

1122
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,125
Sir, this is the temple of justice.

1123
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:44,583
Look, there is no...

1124
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,250
- veneration, worship, or God...
- Of course, there is.

1125
00:58:47,833 --> 00:58:49,958
You are the god of justice, aren't you?

1126
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:50,958
Yes.

1127
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:54,541
Who is your lawyer?

1128
00:58:55,916 --> 00:59:00,083
Sir, I've decided to defend my son's case.

1129
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:01,791
Here is my letter of authorization.

1130
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,875
"To the... legal..."

1131
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,000
It's in Hindi.

1132
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,125
Yes, it's in Hindi.

1133
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,250
The chaste Hindi.

1134
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:15,958
Okay.

1135
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:17,916
Okay, Ms. Kamini.

1136
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:19,625
You can proceed.

1137
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,958
Thank you, My Lord.

1138
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:28,000
I have studied this case,
and it's absolutely pointless,

1139
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,125
- baseless, and...
- Sir.

1140
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:31,375
What... what is it?

1141
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:34,500
Can Mr. Maheshwari's daughter-in-law
speak in Hindi?

1142
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:35,750
Kamini Maheshwari.

1143
00:59:36,083 --> 00:59:36,916
That's my name.

1144
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,166
Yes, Ms. Kamini,
my English is not doing well.

1145
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,125
That's alright.

1146
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:44,208
This case is absolutely baseless.

1147
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:48,208
His son was caught
doing a wrong act in school.

1148
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,000
What wrong act?

1149
00:59:50,083 --> 00:59:52,458
Listen, you cannot interrupt like this.

1150
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,875
{\an8}If you have an objection...

1151
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,625
{\an8}If you have an objection,
stand up and say, "Objection".

1152
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:59,833
You can say, "I object".

1153
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,750
Yes, you may say, "I object".

1154
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,291
Stand up and say that?

1155
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,208
- What if I'm already standing?
- You...

1156
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,000
If you're already standing,
then it's okay.

1157
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,375
Just say, "I object".

1158
01:00:09,875 --> 01:00:11,083
But when you're sitting,

1159
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,833
you have to stand up and say it.

1160
01:00:13,916 --> 01:00:16,166
It's okay if I'm standing. When I'm
sitting, I have to stand up and say it.

1161
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:18,250
- Yes. And don't interfere.
- I get it, sir.

1162
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:19,583
I get it, sir.

1163
01:00:19,666 --> 01:00:20,500
Okay.

1164
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,833
His son was caught...

1165
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:26,166
masturbating in the school bathroom.

1166
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,333
I object while standing, sir!

1167
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,916
- Overruled.
- Is there any proof or evidence

1168
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,041
- supporting Ms. Kamini's statement...
- Overruled. Overruled.

1169
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:33,416
- Any proof...
- Sustained!

1170
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:34,750
What, sir?

1171
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,541
Sustained.

1172
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,291
- Sustained. Say it.
- Sustain.

1173
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,083
No.

1174
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:42,125
I said it.

1175
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:43,500
{\an8}Don't say "sustained".

1176
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,875
{\an8}Sustained means
you must present your point.

1177
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,708
Yes, sir. Of course.

1178
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,416
Is there any written or verbal evidence

1179
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:51,500
proving masturbating is wrong?

1180
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:53,041
No, because...

1181
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:55,208
If there is no written
or verbal evidence,

1182
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,541
how can you call it wrong?

1183
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,666
Not every immoral act
is written in some book.

1184
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:01,583
It's morally wrong.

1185
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,291
So, the school rusticated Vivek
on moral grounds.

1186
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,541
{\an8}Thus, to express his disappointment

1187
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:09,625
and to cover up his son's act,

1188
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,625
he sued the school
and others for defamation.

1189
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,500
Sir, may I speak?

1190
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,000
Yes, go ahead.

1191
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,958
Sir, whatever my son did...

1192
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,791
was out of curiosity,
ignorance, and misinformation.

1193
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:34,083
If the school had provided him
with sex education,

1194
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:35,666
{\an8}he would have never done this.

1195
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,666
{\an8}He wouldn't be recorded on camera
or be fooled by all these people!

1196
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,458
And the school is responsible
for this, sir!

1197
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,416
You have no idea
about my son's condition.

1198
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,041
He cannot look anyone in the eye.

1199
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,375
He cannot step out of the house.

1200
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,166
He tried to commit suicide.

1201
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,916
I blame myself for his wrong upbringing.

1202
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:57,375
And for that, I keep 101 rupees here...

1203
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,500
and apologize.

1204
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:02,875
Now please tell the school
to pay 101 rupees and apologize.

1205
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,833
And take the kid back to school.

1206
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:09,791
My Lord, I doubt there's
a single school in the country

1207
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:13,500
that has masturbation on its syllabus.

1208
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,875
I object again, sir.

1209
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:19,375
They didn't have... "salasalasa"
on their syllabus either.

1210
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,125
But the school is teaching it.

1211
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:23,416
What is "lasalasa"?

1212
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,666
"Salasalasa", sir.

1213
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,291
He means salsa dance.

1214
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:28,833
Yes, dance.

1215
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,041
That's a co-curricular activity,

1216
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,333
and you signed the consent form for it.

1217
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,333
As a guardian.

1218
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,458
My Lord, please dismiss this case.

1219
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:39,916
Tomorrow if some kid
drowns in the Shipra River,

1220
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,250
his parents will also
drag the school to court

1221
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,791
stating that they didn't
teach him how to swim.

1222
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:46,541
This is absolutely ridiculous.

1223
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:47,541
Mr. Kanti.

1224
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:50,500
- Yes, sir?
- This is not taught in school.

1225
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:54,541
Otherwise, we would have heard your plea.

1226
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:56,500
And even otherwise, Mr. Kanti,

1227
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:59,708
you can't just blame people like that
and bring them to court.

1228
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,250
You're wasting the court's time.

1229
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,875
{\an8}- Thank you.
- We are not registering your case.

1230
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,750
Sir, please. Just one minute.
I want to show you a book.

1231
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:09,625
- Take out the book.
- Sir...

1232
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:12,791
Sir...

1233
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,208
here is a book

1234
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,916
that was written 200 years Before Christ.

1235
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,625
It has been translated into 60 languages.

1236
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:26,541
And the stories are taught to the children
in Greece, Persia, Arabia, Europe...

1237
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:32,541
and many other countries
along with India.

1238
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,000
My son studies it too.

1239
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:36,583
Sir, with your permission,

1240
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:38,750
I would like to read its first page.

1241
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:39,958
Go ahead. Read.

1242
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:40,875
King.

1243
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:48,166
"What is the point of having
an uneducated son?"

1244
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:50,541
Minister.

1245
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:54,416
"Your Majesty, it takes 12 years

1246
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:56,416
to learn grammar.

1247
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:02,541
And then, science, economics,
religion, and sex education,

1248
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,375
will make your son wise and educated."

1249
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,375
This book is <i>Panchatantra...</i>

1250
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,416
written by Vishnu Sharma.

1251
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:13,000
Tell me one thing, sir.

1252
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:18,500
If sex education was being
taught in India 2200 years ago,

1253
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:20,958
then why didn't they teach it to my son?

1254
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,416
And if it was banned,

1255
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,958
then who banned it?
When and why was it banned?

1256
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,458
I feel ashamed to imagine...

1257
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:34,541
that you are defending
your son's vulgar act!

1258
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,541
Burger act?

1259
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:37,958
- Vulgar.
- Obscene.

1260
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,083
- Vulgar.
- Obscene.

1261
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,041
As in burger patty?

1262
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:41,416
Obscene act.

1263
01:04:41,541 --> 01:04:42,458
Obscene act.

1264
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:44,000
Obscene act.

1265
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,000
Obscene?!

1266
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,375
- Obscene?!
- Yes!

1267
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:50,208
Your Honor, immoral acts
are never written in books.

1268
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,750
But the right ones are.

1269
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,250
Chandu, get me the books.

1270
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:54,250
Sir...

1271
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:57,166
<i>Kama Sutra, Charak Samhita, Ayurveda.</i>

1272
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,791
None of these books deems
masturbation as a vulgar act or a sin.

1273
01:05:02,250 --> 01:05:03,333
What is vulgarity?

1274
01:05:04,125 --> 01:05:05,583
What is vulgarity, sir?

1275
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:09,791
Our city is known for Shivling
all over the world.

1276
01:05:10,041 --> 01:05:12,416
In fact, it sits in their very school.

1277
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,791
And according to ancient beliefs,

1278
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:17,333
Shivling emerged from
the womb of Shakti.

1279
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:19,375
We worship it.

1280
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,916
We anoint it with milk,
honey, and water.

1281
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:24,125
That's not all.

1282
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:25,375
Lord Krishna quotes...

1283
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:28,000
"I am desire
which is not contrary to righteousness."

1284
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,500
It means, "I am desire".

1285
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,750
The first feeling that aroused in God...

1286
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,083
was desire.

1287
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,250
That is when the universe was created.

1288
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:40,541
{\an8}You, me, them...
we were all created, sir.

1289
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:41,958
Can we avoid...

1290
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:43,875
Sir, look...

1291
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,750
Khajurao, Ajanta, Ellora.

1292
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,375
If they are vulgar,

1293
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,625
then why do we let children watch for
free, and charge adults money to see them?

1294
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:54,666
What is all this?

1295
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:56,583
What's going on here?

1296
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,625
Look.

1297
01:05:58,125 --> 01:06:01,958
Religion, material world,
desire, and salvation...

1298
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,500
are the four pillars of Sanatan Dharma.

1299
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,708
And you call them vulgar!

1300
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:09,750
Are you trying to imply
what your son did was right?

1301
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:13,666
If the school had taught him well,
he could have done it better?

1302
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:16,041
The school should teach him sex?

1303
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:17,291
I object, sir.

1304
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:19,875
Sex education is a science.

1305
01:06:20,375 --> 01:06:24,833
It imparts knowledge about the dos
and don'ts, and rights and wrongs of sex.

1306
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,875
If the school had taught my child this,

1307
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,625
he wouldn't have become the laughingstock.

1308
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:31,708
In that case, you should
have sued the education system,

1309
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:32,625
not the school.

1310
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:34,000
Not again, sir.

1311
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:36,750
Imagine you get run
over by a Tata truck.

1312
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:37,750
- And it was the driver's mistake.
- My accident...

1313
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:38,791
You lose your right leg.

1314
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,625
- You get handicapped.
- Mr. Kanti...

1315
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:43,458
Now would you sue the driver
or Mr. Tata?

1316
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,625
They should be grateful
that I'm only asking for an apology.

1317
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:52,000
They cannot even begin
to compensate for his mental condition.

1318
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:57,041
Sir, please tell them to apologize...

1319
01:06:57,541 --> 01:07:00,125
and... deposit the money.
That's all.

1320
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:01,291
Out of respect to you.

1321
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,000
That's all.

1322
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:08,958
He's saying that's all.

1323
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:11,041
Why don't you sit here?

1324
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:14,791
Ms. Kamini...

1325
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,458
I think he has a point.

1326
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,000
Mr. Kanti, you do have a point.

1327
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,000
So, we must discuss this point.

1328
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,791
Yes, sir. We should discuss this point,
and register the case as well.

1329
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:28,291
Yes, Mr. Kanti.

1330
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,333
You have a point.

1331
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:32,500
So, I register your case.

1332
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:37,041
Hail Lord Mahadev!

1333
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:38,833
SHIVKALYAN HOUSING COMMITTEE

1334
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:44,041
One rotten fish spoils the whole pond.

1335
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:45,500
What happened?
Why is there a crowd here?

1336
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,166
Who will be responsible if
our children follow in his footsteps?

1337
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,166
We're being mocked all over the city.

1338
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,000
The phone won't stop ringing.

1339
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,041
I'm running out of excuses.

1340
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:00,458
Hail Lord Mahadev.

1341
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,708
Go ahead and defend your son, Kanti.

1342
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:06,958
But not as an employee of this place.

1343
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:11,250
We don't want people
to mistake your opinions

1344
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,750
as my voice and opinion.

1345
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:17,791
Please evacuate my shop and my house.

1346
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,041
Hail Mahadev.

1347
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:21,208
Shame on their upbringing!

1348
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:25,708
Move.

1349
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,333
Where will we go?

1350
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:33,625
He is not our master.

1351
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:36,541
He is.

1352
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:37,583
Mahakaal.

1353
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:40,083
Have faith.

1354
01:08:40,958 --> 01:08:42,666
You are Lord Shiva's disciple.

1355
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:58,458
<i>With the lofty serpent
As garland around His neck</i>

1356
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:01,791
<i>Along with His damaru
Shiva did the fierce tandava on the ground</i>

1357
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,875
<i>Consecrated by the water flowing
From His thick, forest-like hair locks</i>

1358
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,166
<i>Every moment, I bow to Lord Shiva
Whose forehead has a flaming fire</i>

1359
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:11,291
<i>Who has a crescent moon on His head</i>

1360
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:17,666
<i>The fire that is spreading out
Because of the breath of the snake</i>

1361
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:24,083
<i>Wandering in whirling motion in the sky</i>

1362
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:29,500
<i>Hail Lord Shiva!</i>

1363
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,666
Lord Mahadev has brought you
to my home, sister-in-law.

1364
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:39,666
Welcome.

1365
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,208
Hail Lord Mahadev.

1366
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:51,708
Hail Lord Mahadev.

1367
01:09:55,416 --> 01:09:56,916
This is selfie mode, no?

1368
01:09:57,916 --> 01:09:59,375
Why can't I see my face?

1369
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:01,083
Yeah.

1370
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,625
- Did you get something to eat?
- No.

1371
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:04,416
- I have got sweets.
- Can I have a bite?

1372
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:11,083
So, do you know this gentleman?

1373
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,291
No.

1374
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,666
But I heard they are having
a really good discussion.

1375
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,833
So, I came here.
What about you?

1376
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,125
Same here.

1377
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
Yeah. That's nice.

1378
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,291
Ms. Kamini, just for the record.

1379
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:37,750
I've never had such a crowd in my court.

1380
01:10:38,208 --> 01:10:40,625
So, I thought... let's capture the moment.

1381
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,250
Hail Lord Mahadev!

1382
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:43,708
Hail Lord Mahadev!

1383
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:44,750
Order. Order.

1384
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:46,916
Ms. Kamini, proceed.

1385
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,250
Thank you, sir.

1386
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,791
Sir, before I proceed,

1387
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,750
I would like to reconfirm once again.

1388
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,833
Is the court and society

1389
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:00,916
ready to have an open discussion on sex?

1390
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,875
There is no going back afterwards.

1391
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,833
Sir... sir.

1392
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:10,041
It's something that's available
on the internet round the clock.

1393
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,625
So, why would anyone object?

1394
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,791
- Absolutely not.
- The whole world is watching.

1395
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:15,250
- No one has an objection.
- It will be fun.

1396
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:16,166
Good.

1397
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:17,208
Very good.

1398
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:20,291
Mr. Makwana. Bring him in.

1399
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,208
That's the boy.

1400
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,750
He was in the video.

1401
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,333
Come, Vivek.

1402
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:30,541
Don't worry.

1403
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,125
You don't have to be afraid.

1404
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:36,833
You don't have to worry at all.

1405
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:41,500
Don't be scared.
Just answer her questions, okay?

1406
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,375
Thank you.

1407
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:07,458
Don't be afraid, Vivek.

1408
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,166
How are you?

1409
01:12:11,416 --> 01:12:12,375
Missing school?

1410
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:16,708
Tell me, do you
want to come back to school?

1411
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,875
You won't have to sit
with the other kids in class.

1412
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:24,041
The teachers will teach you
separately after school hours.

1413
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,833
Like remedial classes.

1414
01:12:27,083 --> 01:12:27,916
Would that be okay?

1415
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,833
Okay, tell me now, Vivek.

1416
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:52,083
What you did in the school bathroom...

1417
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,250
which everyone saw...

1418
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,875
Everyone saw on the internet.

1419
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,791
All your friends, all your neighbors.

1420
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,458
Was it the right thing?

1421
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:08,708
Is your school responsible
for what you did?

1422
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,125
Yes?

1423
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:15,583
Yes?

1424
01:13:16,958 --> 01:13:17,875
Yes?!

1425
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,791
Vivek... Vivek!

1426
01:13:21,916 --> 01:13:23,833
- Vivek!
- You are insulting the court.

1427
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:25,333
You can be punished.

1428
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:33,083
Sir, we have top-class universities
in our country.

1429
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,958
We have high-class education.

1430
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,958
But has that reduced the crime rate?

1431
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,666
Are heinous crimes like rape
not committed anymore?

1432
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:43,000
No matter what happens,

1433
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:46,166
why are schools
and the education system blamed?

1434
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:51,250
Our history, literature, and scriptures
like <i>Ramayana</i> and <i>Mahabharata...</i>

1435
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:53,416
enlighten us.

1436
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:55,791
But can he guarantee that

1437
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,791
there are no villains like Ravana
and Kamsa in our society?

1438
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,125
Anyway, this argument is relevant

1439
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,958
only if his son
is willing to come to school.

1440
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:05,583
We are ready to give him admission.

1441
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:06,791
We will take him back.

1442
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,708
But is he ready?

1443
01:14:09,958 --> 01:14:12,208
He is so embarrassed that
he can't even look anyone in the eye.

1444
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,583
So, what is this facade about?

1445
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:17,125
That's all, sir.

1446
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:25,416
{\an8}PURSHOTTAM NAGAR

1447
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:28,583
{\an8}The court is adjourned till next Friday.

1448
01:14:29,958 --> 01:14:31,250
You just witnessed your son's condition.

1449
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:34,083
Should I summon your wife
and daughter next?

1450
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:40,833
This was no fun.

1451
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:43,125
Ended even before it started.

1452
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:53,916
<i>Fly away, crow</i>

1453
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:55,291
Who is creating this nuisance?

1454
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:58,291
God knows who is this junkie
singing at this hour!

1455
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:01,666
<i>- Take my message...</i>
- Check who it is. Shoo him away.

1456
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:04,333
<i>I'll be obliged</i>

1457
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,791
- Hey, mister!
- <i>It's spring again</i>

1458
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:10,791
- Keep quiet. It's bothering Indumati.
- <i>And the trees have started fruiting</i>

1459
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:14,916
<i>Life is too short...</i>

1460
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:17,833
-<i>And the nights are too long</i>
-Mister!

1461
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:20,375
If you can't stop, at least
sing in a melodious voice.

1462
01:15:21,833 --> 01:15:23,833
Oh, it's you!

1463
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:27,166
Why do you drink
more than you can handle?

1464
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:28,333
Really?

1465
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:32,291
Even Lord Kaal Bhairav drinks.

1466
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:35,375
That's His holy offering.

1467
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,750
This too is Lord Mahakaal's offering.

1468
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,000
Please give me some.

1469
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,500
Wow! This is nectar.

1470
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:50,333
Wow! What a beautiful word!

1471
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:51,458
Nectar.

1472
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:55,291
Kanti, you should say
what society likes to hear.

1473
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:58,875
Speak words that sound good.

1474
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:10,416
Have you ever wondered
if the things you say, your philosophy,

1475
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:13,250
make sense to everyone?

1476
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:16,000
When I need to explain
something to someone...

1477
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:17,833
they always understand.

1478
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,500
Did you find your bag?

1479
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,125
I'm not worried about the bag.

1480
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,000
I'm worried about the person...

1481
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,666
who has it.

1482
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,166
Good night.

1483
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:34,125
Good night.

1484
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:38,125
<i>Come home, O traveler!</i>

1485
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:41,416
<i>Without you my life's incomplete</i>

1486
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:45,166
<i>Come home, O traveler!</i>

1487
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:48,125
<i>Without you I am incomplete</i>

1488
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:52,458
- Where is Damu?
- She's in the latrine.

1489
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:55,291
Damiyanti Mudgal, come up to the stand.

1490
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,791
Curse this society.

1491
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:00,833
Absolutely shameless.

1492
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,333
Summoning the daughter to court.

1493
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,416
She will run out with teary eyes.

1494
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,541
{\an8}PURSHOTTAM NAGAR

1495
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:19,000
Don't be afraid, Damu.

1496
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,375
Just two or three questions.

1497
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,208
Is Vivek your brother?

1498
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,083
What kind of a boy is he?

1499
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,541
He's a good boy.

1500
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:31,833
Good.

1501
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,291
So, tell me one thing.

1502
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:39,166
In this video, which is available
on the internet round the clock,

1503
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:42,458
- what is your "good" brother doing?
- I object, sir.

1504
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:45,916
How can she ask
such questions to a child?

1505
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,041
So, you admit there's
something in this video

1506
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,000
that's bad and vulgar,

1507
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:55,333
- and it cannot be shown to anyone.
- No, I don't admit that.

1508
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:57,291
But she can ask
such questions discreetly.

1509
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,583
Why among so many people?

1510
01:17:59,041 --> 01:17:59,916
Why?

1511
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:01,375
Is it because she's a girl?

1512
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,625
- Lone female.
- No, you...

1513
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:04,916
- Even I'm the only lady here...
- No, that's not...

1514
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,708
From the video, it seems
that a young boy is secretly

1515
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:12,416
using his hands
to achieve sexual arousal.

1516
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:37,083
What is it called?

1517
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,250
This process is called
jerking off, masturbation,

1518
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:43,333
or "taking a selfie"
in our generation's slang.

1519
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,791
What does it do?

1520
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:50,458
This process releases hormones
like oxytocin and dopamine in the body,

1521
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:55,250
leading to arousal, which causes
pleasure and results in sublime peace.

1522
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,708
{\an8}Everyone does it for self-satisfaction.

1523
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,041
Sir, she has been trained well.

1524
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:21,708
{\an8}If the school had taught her, her
answer would have been the same.

1525
01:19:23,083 --> 01:19:24,166
{\an8}Order! Order!

1526
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:28,416
Pay heed to the judge
and stop laughing.

1527
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,541
{\an8}Ms. Kamini,
do you want to take it further?

1528
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:32,375
No, sir.
You can go.

1529
01:19:33,625 --> 01:19:34,791
{\an8}Hail Lord Mahadev!

1530
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,333
Where is Damu?

1531
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:40,583
She's in the latrine.

1532
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,791
Please, Mom!
Just call it the washroom.

1533
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,791
That sounds disgusting.

1534
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:46,416
What did I say?

1535
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:47,958
Latrine!

1536
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,750
- What else do I call it?
- Look...

1537
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,291
Say what sounds pleasant

1538
01:19:54,375 --> 01:19:58,375
and what the society likes to hear.

1539
01:19:58,541 --> 01:20:01,625
- Yeah!
- What's music to the ears is good.

1540
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:05,291
Similarly, something that seems
crass in one way of speaking

1541
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,916
may appear better if put differently.

1542
01:20:09,583 --> 01:20:10,541
Understood?

1543
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,541
Understood?

1544
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:13,750
Understood?

1545
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,500
Indumati, what will you call it?

1546
01:20:17,416 --> 01:20:18,291
Latrine.

1547
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,875
This woman's going to ruin everything.

1548
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:25,708
Indumati Kanti Sharan Mudgal,
come up to the stand.

1549
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:32,416
Hello.

1550
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:36,250
You have a very liberal family.

1551
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,375
Tell me, how is Mr. Kanti as a husband?

1552
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:45,416
He's an ideal man like Lord Rama.

1553
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,583
I see. Good.

1554
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:54,916
Now, tell me, how was your experience
on your wedding night?

1555
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,541
I object, sir.

1556
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:59,125
How is my married life
connected with this?

1557
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:00,541
There is a connection, sir.

1558
01:21:00,916 --> 01:21:07,291
I want to know if the man who has
been ranting about sex education,

1559
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,708
and dares to educate his son about it,

1560
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:14,125
- endorses it on his own family.
- Quiet.

1561
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,166
I want to know

1562
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:20,916
how his family reacts when they are
asked such embarrassing questions.

1563
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:22,833
What is their answer?

1564
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:23,958
Answer her.

1565
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:30,416
You said she would ask me about Vivek.

1566
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,208
But she's asking about you!

1567
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,041
What do I do?
Should I tell her?

1568
01:21:57,541 --> 01:22:00,708
I was married into a large family.

1569
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:03,916
Seven people...

1570
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:06,875
slept in the same room.

1571
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:09,166
There was a curtain that divided us.

1572
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,000
As night fell...

1573
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:14,625
he drank milk and went to bed.

1574
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:16,208
That's how...

1575
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,958
we had two children.

1576
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:22,375
But what exactly happened?

1577
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,708
Sir, I object.
What else does she want to know?

1578
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:26,416
Indu has already answered the question.

1579
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:28,708
"Drank milk, went to bed,
and had two children."

1580
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:30,833
{\an8}Order. Order.

1581
01:22:31,208 --> 01:22:32,083
Order!

1582
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,958
I'm not satisfied, sir.

1583
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,375
I want to know more.

1584
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:36,625
Please elaborate.

1585
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:38,208
The same process
through which you were born.

1586
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,083
That's also how the judge
and I were born.

1587
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:45,875
Do you have children?

1588
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:48,583
No.

1589
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,208
Then you wouldn't know.

1590
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,208
Sir, what about you?

1591
01:22:56,416 --> 01:22:57,625
Do you have children?

1592
01:22:58,833 --> 01:22:59,750
I do.

1593
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,208
He would know.

1594
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:02,833
Ask him...

1595
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,291
how babies are produced.

1596
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:07,541
Tell her.

1597
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,333
Fine.

1598
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:11,833
You may go.

1599
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,291
Come.

1600
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,833
His family has come well prepared, sir.

1601
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,791
These are the things that
a decent family would never want to hear.

1602
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:33,250
They are saying it so casually
only to prove one point.

1603
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:37,416
{\an8}If they can talk about sex,
then why can't the school?

1604
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:39,916
They intend to malign my school...

1605
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,583
I'm sorry.

1606
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:44,708
They intend to malign my client

1607
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,416
for a shameful act done by his son.

1608
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,458
Sir, whether it's a shameful
act or a natural process,

1609
01:23:50,541 --> 01:23:51,625
that's for you to decide.

1610
01:23:51,875 --> 01:23:53,166
Why is she acting like the judge?

1611
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:55,375
Maybe you should get up
and let her sit.

1612
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:57,333
Go on. Please get up, sir.

1613
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:59,250
Hey, assistant, ask the judge
to vacate the seat for her.

1614
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,541
Sir, what's going on?

1615
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:02,958
Why did he ask you to get up?

1616
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:08,083
What happened, sir?

1617
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:10,375
Please, sir. Sit down.

1618
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:11,708
I was only joking.

1619
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:13,500
Forgive me, sir. I was...

1620
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,250
I was only joking.
Forgive me, sir.

1621
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,250
I was just joking, sir.
Forgive me, sir.

1622
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,250
Sir... sir!

1623
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,750
What's going on here?

1624
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,041
What do you think?
Is this a picnic spot?

1625
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:29,708
Are you here on a picnic?

1626
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:31,333
It's a courtroom!

1627
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:35,833
Aren't you ashamed of stuffing
your mouth with food?

1628
01:24:37,958 --> 01:24:39,125
Throw them in jail for two days.

1629
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:40,208
- And no food...
- Sir, please...

1630
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:41,250
Shut up!

1631
01:24:41,458 --> 01:24:43,916
- And get out of here! Bloody jokers.
- Get out. Come on.

1632
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,250
- Get out of here.
- Hurry up.

1633
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:48,250
No food is allowed in court.
Come on.

1634
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:51,083
And Ms. Kamini,

1635
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,625
please refrain from
these kinds of questions.

1636
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,416
I'm sorry, sir.

1637
01:24:57,958 --> 01:24:59,416
I will, but...

1638
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,458
by using chaste language,

1639
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:05,500
how can this family
say such obscene things?

1640
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,750
I object, sir.

1641
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:09,875
What Vivek did was a natural process.

1642
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,916
The school doesn't understand
such a small issue.

1643
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,416
In fact, they just don't
want to hear the word "sex".

1644
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,916
Sir, he fails to understand that

1645
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,458
the disgusting act done by his son

1646
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:24,083
was inside the school.

1647
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:27,625
A school that is considered
a temple of knowledge.

1648
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,291
That has a reputation
and credibility in this state.

1649
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:33,750
A school that doesn't
discriminate among its students.

1650
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:37,333
And to prove that,
I would like to call my next witness.

1651
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:40,083
Ma'am, please come in.

1652
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,416
Please. Come in.

1653
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:42,458
Make way.

1654
01:25:42,625 --> 01:25:43,458
Come.

1655
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:46,083
Who is she?

1656
01:25:51,666 --> 01:25:54,458
Does your son study
at Savoday International?

1657
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:00,125
Yes, he does.

1658
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,000
Ma'am, would you please tell the judge
about your work?

1659
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:08,791
Please don't feel embarrassed.

1660
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:10,583
Savoday is with you.

1661
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:12,083
Go on, ma'am.

1662
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:13,250
Please speak.

1663
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,250
I...

1664
01:26:17,666 --> 01:26:19,083
I'm a sex worker.

1665
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,583
She's a prostitute.

1666
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,791
What is going on here?

1667
01:26:27,125 --> 01:26:28,041
Thank you.

1668
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,333
A school he's suing for defamation...

1669
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:41,166
educates the child
of a sex worker as well.

1670
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:43,791
Professionally, you could be
doing anything outside.

1671
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:45,125
But within the school premises,

1672
01:26:45,458 --> 01:26:47,000
it's the school's responsibility to ensure

1673
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:49,791
that your child is educated
and he or she becomes successful.

1674
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:53,583
And if the school has taken
disciplinary action

1675
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:56,625
in the interest of its other children,
then what is wrong with it?

1676
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,791
Ms. Kamini, you have a point.

1677
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:00,416
Mr. Kanti.

1678
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:03,000
{\an8}Do you want to ask anything?

1679
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:06,708
I thought so.

1680
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:11,250
{\an8}Sir, are you giving the verdict?

1681
01:27:13,541 --> 01:27:16,000
The court will resume
on Friday after lunch.

1682
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:30,041
MAHAKAAL PRASAD BHANDAAR

1683
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,333
<i>We lost the shop, the house.</i>

1684
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:35,708
<i>Next, we'll lose our son
because of the case.</i>

1685
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,291
<i>Do you have an answer?</i>

1686
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:39,000
Brother Kanti.

1687
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:42,375
Bhole Sambhu, Bholenath!

1688
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,458
Bhole Sambhu, Bholenath!

1689
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:46,416
Bhole Sambhu, Bholenath!

1690
01:27:46,583 --> 01:27:48,541
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1691
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:50,541
Bhole Sambhu, Bholenath!

1692
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:52,458
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1693
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,583
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1694
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:56,916
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1695
01:27:57,041 --> 01:27:59,500
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1696
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:02,791
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1697
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,083
Oh, it's you!

1698
01:28:04,958 --> 01:28:06,041
What happened?

1699
01:28:06,375 --> 01:28:07,791
- What's wrong, brother?
- He's crazy.

1700
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:08,833
Idiot.

1701
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:10,916
No, sir. He's not crazy.

1702
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,333
He's just slightly eccentric.

1703
01:28:12,458 --> 01:28:13,541
He's naive.

1704
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:15,500
People don't understand what he says.

1705
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:17,791
Often I find him wise.

1706
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:20,750
What you said the other night...

1707
01:28:21,166 --> 01:28:22,333
You think he's wise?

1708
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:23,916
He's crafty.

1709
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,666
- He has been pestering me all day.
- Oh!

1710
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,875
He says, "You say this is
the City of Lord Mahakaal.

1711
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,333
Take me to Him. I want to question Him."

1712
01:28:30,458 --> 01:28:31,375
I said, "Let's go".

1713
01:28:31,958 --> 01:28:33,375
He's going to question the Lord!

1714
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:34,791
So?

1715
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:37,625
Why else are all these people
waiting in a queue?

1716
01:28:38,416 --> 01:28:39,583
Why?

1717
01:28:40,416 --> 01:28:42,583
They have come here
seeking answers to their questions.

1718
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,708
He has all the answers.

1719
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,291
What am I doing here?

1720
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:48,458
I've come to ask Him where my bag is.

1721
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:51,541
How will you get an answer
without asking a question?

1722
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:52,916
Irrespective of who they are.

1723
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:55,750
Ask and you will get the answer.

1724
01:28:55,875 --> 01:28:56,750
Right?

1725
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:58,416
Questions succeed questions,

1726
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:00,000
which lead to answers.

1727
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,833
Which leads to more questions.

1728
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,208
Every question leads to an answer,

1729
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:04,791
and the answer leads to more questions.

1730
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:07,083
All the answers lie in the question.

1731
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,041
Serves you right.

1732
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:12,166
There's your sea of knowledge.
Take a dip.

1733
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,750
Come on.
Let's go and ask your question.

1734
01:29:15,916 --> 01:29:17,833
Stop playing that song!

1735
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,875
He is married, and he has two kids.

1736
01:29:19,958 --> 01:29:20,916
Even they got married.

1737
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,833
Play a different song, Mr. Sharma.

1738
01:29:23,041 --> 01:29:24,583
Let's go. Keep moving.

1739
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,625
Hail Lord Mahakaal.

1740
01:29:29,666 --> 01:29:31,625
<i>Why else are all these people
waiting in a queue?</i>

1741
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,833
<i>They have come here
seeking answers to their questions.</i>

1742
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:36,291
<i>How will you get an answer
without asking a question?</i>

1743
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:39,125
<i>- Right? Questions succeed questions...</i>
- Mr. Kanti.

1744
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:40,708
<i>which lead to answers.</i>

1745
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,583
<i>Which leads to more questions.</i>

1746
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:44,333
<i>- Every question leads to more answers...</i>
- Mr. Kanti.

1747
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:45,458
Yes, sir.

1748
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,500
Come on, question her.

1749
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:50,916
Ask her what you want to ask.

1750
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:52,333
I apologize.

1751
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,833
You may find these questions difficult.

1752
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:58,625
Madam, the gentlemen who come to you...

1753
01:29:59,083 --> 01:30:00,583
why do they come to you?

1754
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:01,625
What for?

1755
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,833
To satisfy their hunger.

1756
01:30:08,291 --> 01:30:09,291
For their pleasure.

1757
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:12,750
Do you know this position
from the Khajuraho temple?

1758
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:15,041
- What?
- I object, Your Honor.

1759
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,083
This is obscene and vulgar.

1760
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:18,166
He needs to refrain from asking...

1761
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,375
If she questions my wife and children,
it's appropriate,

1762
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:21,833
but if I ask it's "burger".

1763
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:23,666
Rule over!

1764
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:24,833
{\an8}Mr. Kanti.

1765
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:26,541
{\an8}Please.

1766
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:27,458
Yes, sir.

1767
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:30,666
What about this other position?

1768
01:30:30,791 --> 01:30:31,833
Do you know this? See.

1769
01:30:31,916 --> 01:30:34,666
{\an8}What obscene questions
is he asking, sir?

1770
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:36,333
{\an8}It's not obscene.

1771
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:39,166
Her profession
pays for her son's education.

1772
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:42,083
If not anyone else, at least
she must be respecting it.

1773
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,166
Mr. Kanti.

1774
01:30:43,666 --> 01:30:44,958
{\an8}Ask your question.

1775
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,750
Yes. You didn't answer me.

1776
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,750
- Yes.
- Who taught you?

1777
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:01,208
The lady who owns the brothel.

1778
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,416
And she was taught by another lady...

1779
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,000
Probably.

1780
01:31:05,291 --> 01:31:06,791
Why did she teach you these positions?

1781
01:31:08,208 --> 01:31:09,125
Answer me.

1782
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,250
Tell me.

1783
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,916
Why did she teach you these positions?

1784
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:19,083
So that we can give pleasure to men.

1785
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:21,708
To give pleasure to men.

1786
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,041
While giving pleasure to men,

1787
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:26,291
do you get any pleasure yourself?

1788
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:28,625
I object, Your Honor.

1789
01:31:28,708 --> 01:31:31,416
Once again,
this is about a woman's dignity.

1790
01:31:31,541 --> 01:31:33,125
{\an8}- Patience, Ms. Kamini.
- He has to refrain from...

1791
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:35,000
Let her answer.
Let's hear her reply.

1792
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:37,083
{\an8}- Sir...
- Let her finish.

1793
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,291
Yes. So, do you feel any pleasure?

1794
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:40,750
No.

1795
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:41,708
Never?

1796
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,833
I mean once in a blue moon,
there must be someone...

1797
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:49,041
whom you like too.

1798
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:51,666
- Who gives you a moment's pleasure...
- Sir, here's the thing.

1799
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:54,458
People come to us for their own fun,

1800
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:55,500
for their own pleasure.

1801
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:57,208
Not for ours.

1802
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,625
- We have no honor.
- Why?

1803
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:00,916
What do you mean why?

1804
01:32:01,958 --> 01:32:04,625
What do they know about
a woman's body and her heart?

1805
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,708
Some come to ravage us...

1806
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:09,916
some come to do unspeakable things.

1807
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:16,375
And some who can't perform,
come to cry on our shoulders.

1808
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:24,166
So, just like the lady
who owns the brother taught you,

1809
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:29,083
if those men were also taught
about a woman's heart and body,

1810
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:31,125
you wouldn't have to
go through this pain.

1811
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:40,541
Answer me.

1812
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:46,458
Probably not.

1813
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:49,208
Just one more question, sir.

1814
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:53,875
{\an8}I will pray to the Lord
for your son's bright future.

1815
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:56,875
I just want to know where you...

1816
01:32:57,791 --> 01:33:00,916
want to see your son in the future.

1817
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:04,458
Among those ignorant fools
who come to you?

1818
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:09,125
Or among educated people
who have an understanding of sex,

1819
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:16,250
and who know how to honor women
and respect their bodies.

1820
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:19,125
Where do you want to see your son?
Tell me.

1821
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:41,916
Among...

1822
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:44,916
people who know to respect women.

1823
01:33:47,208 --> 01:33:48,083
Sir.

1824
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:50,916
If I say anything now,
Ms. Kamini will deny it again.

1825
01:33:53,083 --> 01:33:54,166
School.

1826
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,291
It is their job to educate.

1827
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:12,541
You can go.

1828
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:15,958
Mr. Kanti, why did you bow before her?

1829
01:34:16,916 --> 01:34:17,791
Sir...

1830
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:20,791
I was bowing...

1831
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,291
before a mother and a teacher.

1832
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:30,250
She is willing to go to any extent
for her child's education.

1833
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:33,416
But the school isn't.

1834
01:34:43,125 --> 01:34:44,083
Please.

1835
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,125
Pranlal Muthut, come to the stand.

1836
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:52,541
What does this oil do, Mr. Muthut?

1837
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:56,000
Sir, this oil will increase...

1838
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,083
No, not like this.

1839
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,500
The same way you...

1840
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:00,500
Oh, like that?

1841
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:02,000
Yes. Exactly like that.

1842
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:04,833
Some people here need elaboration.

1843
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:06,750
Hand it over.

1844
01:35:08,166 --> 01:35:11,583
Who wants the throne
when all you need is a hard scepter?!

1845
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:12,500
Order!

1846
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:16,208
A Popsicle will turn into a baseball bat.
A bat will turn into a flagpole.

1847
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:19,708
- Order!
- And if your lamp is burnt out...

1848
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:20,625
Order!

1849
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:22,291
then your neighbor
will be out on the prowl.

1850
01:35:22,375 --> 01:35:27,083
This oil will make it grow fourfold!

1851
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:31,166
I swear, the High Court
will love the outcome.

1852
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:33,250
- Did he say High Court?
- Yes, sir.

1853
01:35:33,416 --> 01:35:36,208
Hey! Stop it! Stop!

1854
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:37,375
I said stop it!

1855
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:39,583
You said High Court.
It's a contempt of court!

1856
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:41,791
- Lock him up for seven days.
- Sir, it was a slip of the tongue.

1857
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:42,791
A fine of 1000 rupees.

1858
01:35:42,958 --> 01:35:43,875
Arrest him. Take him away.

1859
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:45,458
- What are you doing, sir?
- Bloody joker.

1860
01:35:45,541 --> 01:35:46,750
Forgive me this one time.

1861
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,625
Don't you dare mention
the High Court again!

1862
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:51,125
Never. I get it.

1863
01:35:51,541 --> 01:35:52,416
Leave him. Let him go.

1864
01:35:52,666 --> 01:35:54,875
- Thank you. Here you go, mister.
- Hey.

1865
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:56,958
- Take it.
- Sir...

1866
01:35:57,708 --> 01:36:00,208
I would like to call Dr. Malviya next.

1867
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:03,625
Dr. Malviya, come to the stand.

1868
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:04,625
My Lord.

1869
01:36:05,416 --> 01:36:06,708
Doctor...

1870
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:09,416
what does your examination
say about this oil?

1871
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:10,750
My Lord...

1872
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:14,000
I have used this oil.

1873
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,250
Useless.

1874
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:20,833
Now my wife uses it in her sewing machine.

1875
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:25,375
The sewing machine is running swiftly.
Smooth.

1876
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:27,416
But the needle...

1877
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,208
no development.

1878
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,000
- Still the same size.
- Order.

1879
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:34,583
Order.

1880
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:36,708
Sir...

1881
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:40,416
can Dr. B. D. Shah and his
miraculous machine come here?

1882
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:44,708
Dr. B. D. Shah and his miraculous machine,

1883
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:46,666
come to the stand.

1884
01:36:47,458 --> 01:36:49,541
Do this machine and pills help?

1885
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:51,708
It does, sir.

1886
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:53,833
I won't lie.

1887
01:36:53,958 --> 01:36:55,250
Sometimes it doesn't.

1888
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:57,291
It all depends on one's physiology.

1889
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:59,458
And the machine?

1890
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:00,666
It's pretty old.

1891
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:02,041
It's an imported machine.

1892
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:06,041
Sir, this machine convinced my son

1893
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:08,041
that his manhood has a problem.

1894
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,541
You are the judge.

1895
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:10,958
Test it yourself.

1896
01:37:11,916 --> 01:37:13,166
I mean get it tested.

1897
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,083
Order!

1898
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,375
Let's check this out.

1899
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:17,750
It's a full house today.

1900
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:20,833
A handful of people,
who think they are potent,

1901
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:22,125
may come up here.

1902
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:23,666
Let's test everyone one by one.

1903
01:37:24,375 --> 01:37:25,375
Saini...

1904
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,291
you go first.

1905
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,583
- Sir!
- Go. You're the first one.

1906
01:37:29,708 --> 01:37:30,583
- Go.
- Sir...

1907
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:31,708
Go on. Wrap it around.

1908
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,166
Next.

1909
01:37:44,916 --> 01:37:46,750
Everyone's on standby!

1910
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:48,250
Next.

1911
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:50,000
Next.

1912
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:52,166
No one's got any juice.

1913
01:37:52,416 --> 01:37:54,333
Next. Next. Next.

1914
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,125
Next.

1915
01:37:56,666 --> 01:37:57,583
You must be fit.

1916
01:37:57,791 --> 01:37:59,333
Let's test you.
Come on.

1917
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:02,500
- The doctor will register green.
- Come on. Quick.

1918
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:13,875
The machine has been tampered with.

1919
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,708
The doctor's got no juice either!

1920
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:23,875
Seize his machine
and all his certificates!

1921
01:38:24,166 --> 01:38:26,083
Who allows people like you to practice?

1922
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:27,958
Fooling innocent people!

1923
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:29,250
Aren't you ashamed?

1924
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:34,291
Inder Medical, come to the stand.

1925
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:37,500
Jerks.

1926
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,791
{\an8}- Is this yours?
- No.

1927
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,833
It belongs to Kelotex Company.

1928
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:47,000
But you sell it, don't you?

1929
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:49,000
Of course. We have a license to sell it.

1930
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:50,875
Doctors prescribe it, and we sell it.

1931
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,416
How did you sell it to my son?

1932
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:54,000
I didn't sell this to your son.

1933
01:38:54,416 --> 01:38:55,500
I don't know where he got it from.

1934
01:38:55,583 --> 01:38:56,458
Sure.

1935
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:59,208
Maybe he got a fake
doctor's prescription

1936
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:01,416
and purchased it from somewhere else.

1937
01:39:02,125 --> 01:39:03,000
Maybe.

1938
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:04,625
But do you at least know

1939
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:07,125
that it's a crime
to sell these to children

1940
01:39:07,583 --> 01:39:09,375
without a doctor's prescription?

1941
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,625
Yes, of course.

1942
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:13,916
Then who is going to tell that
to the children?

1943
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:15,833
Sir, there's a warning on the cover.

1944
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:17,291
"Keep away from children."

1945
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,083
Parents have to take care of that.

1946
01:39:19,166 --> 01:39:20,208
Yes.

1947
01:39:21,541 --> 01:39:24,625
Well, let's have a debate over this.

1948
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:26,500
What do these pills do?

1949
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:29,166
It increases your sexual power.

1950
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,333
As in...

1951
01:39:30,458 --> 01:39:32,958
do you understand erectile dysfunction?

1952
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,333
Does it increase the size of the penis?

1953
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:36,583
It does not make it longer.
It makes it harder.

1954
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,750
How do you know?

1955
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:40,000
Well, I've studied this.

1956
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:41,791
- How else would I know?
- Please pay attention, sir.

1957
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:44,208
He claims to know this
because he has studied this.

1958
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:49,208
Does your study speak
of any medicine in this world

1959
01:39:49,333 --> 01:39:50,750
that increases the size of the penis?

1960
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:55,500
No.

1961
01:39:55,583 --> 01:40:00,416
If it was explained to my son
and he was made aware of the fact

1962
01:40:00,916 --> 01:40:02,916
that it has nothing to do with size...

1963
01:40:03,416 --> 01:40:06,125
and it only makes the penis harder,
would he have bought this medicine?

1964
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,125
Should he be learning about this, sir?

1965
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:11,041
He wasn't taught any of this
because he hasn't come of age.

1966
01:40:11,125 --> 01:40:13,875
Sir, here's the school biology textbook.

1967
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,083
- Chandu, please...
- Sir, another book?

1968
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:16,291
Look at this, sir.

1969
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:17,458
What's going on, sir?

1970
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:19,291
They teach children
the reproductive system of animals.

1971
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:23,541
Butterflies, sunflowers, frogs,
tadpoles, and whatnot.

1972
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:24,625
But not of humans.

1973
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:27,041
Look at this discrimination, sir.
Here's <i>Balbharti.</i>

1974
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,916
{\an8}They can show a breastfeeding calf,

1975
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:34,166
but they feel embarrassed to teach
how the mother breastfeeds her child.

1976
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:37,375
Sir, this is not discrimination.
This is science.

1977
01:40:37,875 --> 01:40:38,833
Overruled.

1978
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:40,041
Tell me, brother.

1979
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:42,958
{\an8}If my son had been taught about it,
would he have bought this medicine?

1980
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:46,291
Answer me.

1981
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:50,875
Tell me.

1982
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:53,958
{\an8}Speak up.

1983
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:55,458
I don't know.

1984
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:57,333
Probably... not.

1985
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:58,625
Probably not.

1986
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:03,000
{\an8}Whose responsibility is it
to clear Vivek's misconception?

1987
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,708
Come on, answer.

1988
01:41:05,958 --> 01:41:07,500
Sir, his family.

1989
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,666
Sure. And who else?

1990
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:11,416
And...

1991
01:41:12,375 --> 01:41:13,958
Tell me, who else?

1992
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:16,250
Tell me, who else?

1993
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:18,458
The school...

1994
01:41:18,625 --> 01:41:19,666
What? Who?

1995
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,666
The school.

1996
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,791
The school, sir.

1997
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:26,500
If the school doesn't teach them,

1998
01:41:27,125 --> 01:41:29,000
we have these fake universities
to mislead them.

1999
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,416
They have been
misleading them for decades.

2000
01:41:31,458 --> 01:41:34,708
{\an8}My family and I admit our mistake, sir.

2001
01:41:35,083 --> 01:41:36,958
But the school won't admit its mistake.

2002
01:41:37,208 --> 01:41:40,125
He always manages
to spin matters around

2003
01:41:40,208 --> 01:41:43,541
and drag the school into every debate.

2004
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:45,666
What does he want?

2005
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:50,125
A male teacher to teach female students,

2006
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:52,791
and a female teacher
to teach male students...

2007
01:41:53,625 --> 01:41:54,500
about sex.

2008
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:55,875
Okay.

2009
01:41:56,416 --> 01:41:57,541
How are they going to teach them?

2010
01:41:58,125 --> 01:42:00,708
"The boy is undressing the girl.

2011
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:03,833
The boy is touching the girl's body parts.

2012
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,958
The boy is now..."

2013
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:07,541
It's ridiculous, sir!

2014
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:11,208
Does anyone here know how to teach them?

2015
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:14,041
Okay. Sir, you?

2016
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:15,791
Can you teach them?

2017
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:19,375
You see, Your Honor.

2018
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:21,916
It's always easier said than done...

2019
01:42:22,625 --> 01:42:24,875
but practically, it's difficult.

2020
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:33,541
Answer her, Mr. Kanti.

2021
01:42:34,875 --> 01:42:36,041
Can you teach them?

2022
01:42:36,875 --> 01:42:39,916
No, sir. I'm not a teacher. I...

2023
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,125
- Tell him to find a way...
- I'm just...

2024
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,791
which is not vulgar.

2025
01:42:45,333 --> 01:42:48,916
A way to openly teach intercourse
in the course.

2026
01:42:50,708 --> 01:42:52,125
Or he can withdraw his case.

2027
01:42:57,833 --> 01:42:59,541
The court gives you time.

2028
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:01,125
Think about it.

2029
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:03,458
Court resumes after Shivratri.

2030
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:16,666

Har Har Mahadev!

2069
01:46:17,041 --> 01:46:18,958
You dance pretty well.

2070
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:20,875
Pretty well?

2071
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,750
It's the price I'm paying
for sticking my nose in others' business.

2072
01:46:23,916 --> 01:46:26,500
First I lost my bag.
Then their dancer didn't turn up.

2073
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:28,083
Seeing my huge locks,
they made me climb a truck.

2074
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:30,166
They said, "We'll pay you well
for a performance."

2075
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:32,583
What is this?

2076
01:46:32,666 --> 01:46:33,583
<i>Kachori.</i>

2077
01:46:33,708 --> 01:46:34,625
Give me two.

2078
01:46:34,958 --> 01:46:36,375
You look nice.

2079
01:46:38,791 --> 01:46:40,000
But you don't.

2080
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:42,166
Is your son alright?

2081
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:46,166
No. He's furious.

2082
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:49,291
He feels that
I shouldn't have filed this case.

2083
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:53,333
He feels I'm stripping him naked
in front of society.

2084
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,291
Is he totally stripped?

2085
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:57,666
What?

2086
01:46:57,750 --> 01:47:00,375
I mean, it's okay if you
want to strip him completely.

2087
01:47:00,458 --> 01:47:04,333
But if you want to reveal
a little and hide the rest,

2088
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,666
your problem will never be solved.

2089
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:09,666
Don't suppress it.

2090
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:12,375
Say it openly.
Truth is always naked.

2091
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:15,291
You shouldn't feel embarrassed to say it.

2092
01:47:16,333 --> 01:47:18,500
- Are you done, mister? Give it.
- Yes.

2093
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,416
Here you go...

2094
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,000
What happened?
What are you thinking about?

2095
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:26,833
Kanti.

2096
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:27,958
Hey!

2097
01:47:28,916 --> 01:47:29,833
Here.

2098
01:47:30,416 --> 01:47:34,125
Sir, I never understand
half the things you say.

2099
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:36,583
Why don't you say things directly?

2100
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:40,166
Brother, I'm always honest
and direct with my words.

2101
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:43,458
Because for me,
the most beautiful thing is the truth.

2102
01:47:43,541 --> 01:47:46,166
And truth is... Lord Shiva.

2103
01:47:46,958 --> 01:47:50,083
I only believe in the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

2104
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:53,041
Have faith because you are...

2105
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:55,125
- Lord Shiva's disciple.
- No.

2106
01:47:55,541 --> 01:47:56,916
You are Lord Shiva's ally.

2107
01:47:57,375 --> 01:47:58,875
- I'll see you.
- Yes.

2108
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,166
Please pay up.

2109
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:03,500
I don't want blessings.
I want my money.

2110
01:48:05,958 --> 01:48:07,750
- Alright.
- I'll pay him.

2111
01:48:08,333 --> 01:48:10,291
I'll pay him.
You owe me one.

2112
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:12,083
Here you go.

2113
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:14,750
Hail Lord Mahakaal!

2114
01:48:15,291 --> 01:48:16,166
Listen.

2115
01:48:16,666 --> 01:48:19,333
Look carefully before
you eat the fritter, okay?

2116
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,000
I'll see you then.

2117
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:26,166
Hail Lord Mahakaal!

2118
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,250

<i>When you are restless
Just tread alone</i>

2125
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:08,791
<i>O follower!
When the night seems long</i>

2126
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:09,791
<i>And nothing seems right</i>

2127
01:49:09,875 --> 01:49:11,875
<i>When you are restless
Just tread alone</i>

2128
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:17,500
<i>Tread alone, follower
Show courage today</i>

2129
01:49:17,583 --> 01:49:21,500
<i>The night and day will be your slave</i>

2130
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:27,208
<i>When your reputation is at stake
And no one's on your side</i>

2131
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:28,375
<i>Tread alone</i>

2132
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:33,791
<i>O follower, tread alone
Show courage today</i>

2133
01:49:33,875 --> 01:49:38,750
<i>The night and day will be your slave</i>

2134
01:49:39,916 --> 01:49:42,625
<i>O follower!
When the night seems long</i>

2135
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:43,625
<i>And nothing seems right</i>

2136
01:49:43,708 --> 01:49:45,750
<i>When you are restless
Just tread alone</i>

2137
01:50:03,375 --> 01:50:04,500
Take one from that angle.

2138
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:06,208
And one from here.

2139
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:11,083
Mr. Kanti.

2140
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:12,458
Please begin.

2141
01:50:12,541 --> 01:50:13,666
Hail Lord Mahadev.

2142
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:16,208
Hail Lord Mahadev!

2143
01:50:17,333 --> 01:50:21,541
Sir, if Ms. Kamini has no objection,

2144
01:50:21,833 --> 01:50:23,750
I want to praise her beauty.

2145
01:50:24,375 --> 01:50:26,416
All of a sudden, why are you...

2146
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:28,916
- I don't know if she will be okay...
- That's okay, sir.

2147
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:30,291
I don't mind.

2148
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:33,000
Say what you want to say.
She's fine with it.

2149
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:34,041
Thank you.

2150
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:36,750
If you have any objection at any moment,

2151
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:38,583
stop me right there.

2152
01:50:38,833 --> 01:50:39,708
Absolutely.

2153
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:41,875
Ms. Kamini, you are gorgeous.

2154
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,041
Indeed beautiful.

2155
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:47,416
The science of <i>Kaam Shastra</i> has divided
women into four categories.

2156
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:52,333
<i>Padmini, Hastini, Shankhini</i> and <i>Chitrini.</i>

2157
01:50:52,708 --> 01:50:55,541
You represent all four of them.

2158
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,458
Your bow-like arched eyebrows.

2159
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,416
Mesmerizing eyes.

2160
01:51:01,958 --> 01:51:03,416
- Sharp nose.
- Kamini, what is this?

2161
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:04,916
- Luscious lips.
- It's okay.

2162
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:07,583
Long and slender neck.
Evolved anterior.

2163
01:51:07,666 --> 01:51:09,041
- Capricious posterior.
- What is he saying?

2164
01:51:09,125 --> 01:51:11,041
They are all so attractive.

2165
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:15,208
Your husband is a lucky man.

2166
01:51:16,791 --> 01:51:17,666
Thank you.

2167
01:51:17,791 --> 01:51:19,416
Thank you very much for the compliment.

2168
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:24,750
Sir, I want to thank her.

2169
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:30,583
Thanks to her I could delve
into my culture and scriptures.

2170
01:51:31,291 --> 01:51:35,375
Some people make fun
of our scriptures and sacred texts.

2171
01:51:35,458 --> 01:51:36,666
They mock it.

2172
01:51:37,375 --> 01:51:38,666
But, sir, the truth is...

2173
01:51:39,541 --> 01:51:42,166
when the rest of the world
was still taking baby steps,

2174
01:51:42,333 --> 01:51:45,541
our Sanatan Hindu Dharma
was running miles ahead of them.

2175
01:51:46,625 --> 01:51:49,750
We were modern.

2176
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:55,000
Sir, it's so beautifully
written in this book.

2177
01:51:55,791 --> 01:51:58,250
"A woman's vagina is pious...

2178
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:03,750
in which, immersion of sperm
gives birth to new life."

2179
01:52:04,625 --> 01:52:05,708
How simple.

2180
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:09,666
It's written so beautifully
and it can be explained to anyone.

2181
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:14,500
For example, I was describing
Ms. Kamini's beauty in beautiful words.

2182
01:52:14,666 --> 01:52:15,708
Objection, sir.

2183
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,583
What does he want to imply?

2184
01:52:17,666 --> 01:52:19,041
How are the two connected?

2185
01:52:19,208 --> 01:52:20,166
What does it prove?

2186
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:21,625
Yes, Ms. Kamini.

2187
01:52:21,791 --> 01:52:25,541
Mr. Kanti, please tell us, how do we
implement sex education in schools...

2188
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:29,333
How to teach them sex?
Just tell us that.

2189
01:52:29,708 --> 01:52:30,583
Openly.

2190
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:31,750
Openly?

2191
01:52:32,083 --> 01:52:33,333
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

2192
01:52:33,791 --> 01:52:36,000
Openly. Without inhibition.
Just the way it is.

2193
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:37,583
Honestly.

2194
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:39,833
Without hiding anything.
The naked truth.

2195
01:52:40,791 --> 01:52:42,166
Show me that chart.

2196
01:52:42,625 --> 01:52:43,541
Sir...

2197
01:52:44,416 --> 01:52:46,625
look at this picture.
These are the eyes, nose, ears.

2198
01:52:46,708 --> 01:52:48,791
- And this...
- I object! Sir, he has to roll it back.

2199
01:52:48,875 --> 01:52:51,000
I'm very uncomfortable.
Please roll it back.

2200
01:52:51,083 --> 01:52:53,041
- Yeah. Kanti...
- No, sir. He has to roll it back.

2201
01:52:53,125 --> 01:52:54,000
- Sir, no.
- Kanti...

2202
01:52:54,083 --> 01:52:56,750
This is vulgar and obscene.
He has to roll it back.

2203
01:52:56,833 --> 01:52:58,791
- Sir, I object!
- Please roll it back. You...

2204
01:52:58,875 --> 01:53:01,125
- Sir!
- You will find this chart

2205
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:04,541
in every school and laboratory.

2206
01:53:04,666 --> 01:53:06,041
It's in her school as well.

2207
01:53:06,666 --> 01:53:09,208
We teach children
about the eyes, ears, nose.

2208
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:11,750
Similarly, we can tell them
this is a penis and a vagina.

2209
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:14,000
Why hide it from the children, sir?

2210
01:53:14,250 --> 01:53:15,625
From the waist,
directly down to the knees.

2211
01:53:15,708 --> 01:53:17,041
Doesn't this middle part belong to us?

2212
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:21,583
- Why don't we teach them, sir?
- Because they are private parts.

2213
01:53:21,666 --> 01:53:23,083
Secret organs.

2214
01:53:23,833 --> 01:53:24,875
- Yes, sir.
- Genitalia.

2215
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,458
- Genitalia.
- Yes. Genitalia.

2216
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:28,708
Who named them that? We did.

2217
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:32,500
Sir, whenever a child is born,

2218
01:53:32,583 --> 01:53:36,958
the first thing we mention is the gender.

2219
01:53:37,458 --> 01:53:39,250
Sex. Male or female.

2220
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:42,458
Right from birth to death certificates,

2221
01:53:42,541 --> 01:53:45,500
our gender is our identity.

2222
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:49,708
And we feel embarrassed
to talk about it.

2223
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,375
What is this?

2224
01:53:51,500 --> 01:53:52,875
- Ridiculous.
- Ridiculous.

2225
01:53:55,041 --> 01:53:58,375
Do you want children
to be told everything openly?

2226
01:53:58,541 --> 01:54:00,166
That this is a penis and a vagina?

2227
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:01,375
Yes, sir.

2228
01:54:01,708 --> 01:54:03,875
Why can't we tell them
this is a penis and a vagina?

2229
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:06,125
It's our fault, sir.

2230
01:54:06,416 --> 01:54:10,416
We've been calling it Weenie,
Willy, Johnson, and whatnot.

2231
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:13,291
We've been using various other names...

2232
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:15,125
instead of the right terms.

2233
01:54:15,541 --> 01:54:18,500
Calling it by the right name
will make it easier to explain.

2234
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:20,500
Sir, again.

2235
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:22,541
Again, how is it possible?

2236
01:54:23,166 --> 01:54:27,166
Let's admit that modern
society might accept it.

2237
01:54:27,375 --> 01:54:32,166
But what about villages, towns,
two-tier cities, and smaller cities?

2238
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:34,791
Their ideology and lifestyle
are different, sir.

2239
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:37,166
They will never accept this.

2240
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:39,083
Don't they have a body?

2241
01:54:39,666 --> 01:54:42,250
Don't they have a penis,
vagina, or breasts?

2242
01:54:42,541 --> 01:54:45,500
Sir, I object. Please tell him to be
respectful while talking to me.

2243
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:47,541
I'm not comfortable
with the language he is...

2244
01:54:47,625 --> 01:54:50,166
A while ago, you were
smiling at similar words.

2245
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:52,291
And you were thanking me.

2246
01:54:52,833 --> 01:54:54,375
I wonder what you're talking about!

2247
01:54:54,541 --> 01:54:56,833
Sir, for centuries,

2248
01:54:57,208 --> 01:54:58,291
generation after generation,

2249
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:00,458
we've been shy to speak about it openly.

2250
01:55:01,125 --> 01:55:02,375
But the time has come

2251
01:55:03,125 --> 01:55:05,458
to rename it.

2252
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:09,458
Exactly the way it is.

2253
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:13,041
It's time to tell our children
everything honestly.

2254
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:19,250
That the union of a penis
and a vagina gives birth to a new life.

2255
01:55:19,958 --> 01:55:22,375
And that's how
we all came into existence.

2256
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:24,500
You, me, all of us!

2257
01:55:25,916 --> 01:55:28,541
This is the eternal truth of life.

2258
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:32,083
And it is the most beautiful gift.

2259
01:55:51,833 --> 01:55:53,541
Sir, this entire drama is unfolding

2260
01:55:53,625 --> 01:55:58,125
to convince his son
that he didn't do anything wrong.

2261
01:55:58,208 --> 01:55:59,125
That's it.

2262
01:55:59,375 --> 01:56:01,000
But the ground reality is that

2263
01:56:01,083 --> 01:56:05,041
no parent would want this
to be taught to their child, sir.

2264
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:06,166
Is there anyone here?

2265
01:56:06,416 --> 01:56:10,916
Anyone here wants "sex" to be taught
to their children in school?

2266
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:11,958
Raise your hand.

2267
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:12,916
I do.

2268
01:56:13,125 --> 01:56:14,000
I know.

2269
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:15,708
Anyone else?
Don't be embarrassed...

2270
01:56:15,791 --> 01:56:16,791
Yes. One.

2271
01:56:17,416 --> 01:56:18,416
- Yes.
- Two.

2272
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:24,375
Two percent, yes.
Ninety-eight percent, no.

2273
01:56:25,041 --> 01:56:29,041
Mr. Kanti, you have no idea
of the consequences...

2274
01:56:29,875 --> 01:56:32,625
that will emerge if your
suggestions are implemented.

2275
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:34,083
Everything will be out in the open, sir.

2276
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:36,166
There is still some
shame and modesty left.

2277
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:38,208
Women will feel unsafe on the streets.

2278
01:56:38,416 --> 01:56:42,041
Our society will completely
go vulgar and it'll be destroyed.

2279
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:43,041
Sir.

2280
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:46,958
Ours is a leading country
in watching pornography.

2281
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,833
{\an8}When the heart-wrenching rape
of a doctor happened in Hyderabad...

2282
01:56:51,958 --> 01:56:54,125
eighty-eight percent of internet users...

2283
01:56:55,625 --> 01:56:57,041
searched her name.

2284
01:56:59,375 --> 01:57:00,458
To see what?

2285
01:57:02,125 --> 01:57:03,083
Her rape?!

2286
01:57:05,583 --> 01:57:07,291
This is the decent society
we are talking about.

2287
01:57:09,041 --> 01:57:12,500
{\an8}In our country, 54 percent of boys
and 47 percent of girls

2288
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:15,208
{\an8}under the age of 18

2289
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:17,375
{\an8}are victims of sexual abuse.

2290
01:57:18,666 --> 01:57:20,041
It's because those poor souls don't know

2291
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:23,458
the difference between
a good touch and a bad touch.

2292
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,166
And most of the culprits
are people around them.

2293
01:57:27,583 --> 01:57:29,416
And sir... Take out that book.

2294
01:57:29,958 --> 01:57:32,416
Sir, this Padma Shri awardee
respected Dr. Prakash Kothari,

2295
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,916
a renowned sexologist in India.

2296
01:57:34,333 --> 01:57:41,166
He claims that 96 percent of men
and 76 percent of women masturbate,

2297
01:57:41,375 --> 01:57:43,500
and it's an absolutely normal
and healthy process.

2298
01:57:44,375 --> 01:57:46,208
Sir, I want you to see this newspaper.

2299
01:57:47,375 --> 01:57:48,583
Dainik Newspaper.

2300
01:57:48,666 --> 01:57:52,375
The biggest and largest selling
daily newspaper of our state.

2301
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:55,000
I want to read out a column, sir.

2302
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:58,250
"My boyfriend kissed me
on my lips yesterday.

2303
01:57:58,333 --> 01:57:59,541
Will I get pregnant?"

2304
01:57:59,666 --> 01:58:01,166
"I masturbate four to six times a day.

2305
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:03,000
- Will I grow weaker with time?"
- Mr. Kanti.

2306
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:05,166
"My husband drinks a lot of milk,
so his sperm..."

2307
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,750
- Order.
- "I want to sleep with

2308
01:58:06,833 --> 01:58:08,208
- my husband's friend. Will I..."
- Order!

2309
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:10,291
"My boyfriend forces me."

2310
01:58:10,541 --> 01:58:13,125
- "Can I do a sperm count at home?"
- Order! Order!

2311
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:17,208
These two pages of the newspaper...

2312
01:58:19,166 --> 01:58:20,416
are filled with such questions.

2313
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:24,083
These pages wouldn't have existed
if the school had educated them.

2314
01:58:24,583 --> 01:58:26,625
And for all you know,
probably a 12-year-old boy

2315
01:58:26,708 --> 01:58:28,875
is asking these questions
by claiming to be 24.

2316
01:58:30,333 --> 01:58:31,708
This is vulgarity, sir.

2317
01:58:32,375 --> 01:58:34,416
This is obscene.
Teaching is knowledge.

2318
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:38,500
And strangely, sir,
the owner of this newspaper

2319
01:58:38,750 --> 01:58:40,791
is her father-in-law Mr. Atal Nath.

2320
01:58:42,208 --> 01:58:44,291
Look at his double-sided hypocrisy.

2321
01:58:44,625 --> 01:58:47,958
He's ready to publish it,
but he's not ready to teach it.

2322
01:58:48,125 --> 01:58:49,250
True.

2323
01:58:50,250 --> 01:58:52,500
Order. Order.

2324
01:58:53,833 --> 01:58:54,833
Order.

2325
01:58:56,166 --> 01:58:57,916
Order. Order.

2326
01:58:58,666 --> 01:58:59,625
Order.

2327
01:59:02,333 --> 01:59:03,166
Order.

2328
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:06,625
Ms. Kamini,
please ready your closing statement.

2329
01:59:07,125 --> 01:59:07,958
You too.

2330
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:10,416
Next date... 16th.

2331
01:59:12,458 --> 01:59:16,333
{\an8}Mr. Kanti has raised an important
debate regarding sex education.

2332
01:59:16,416 --> 01:59:17,541
{\an8}<i>He is right.</i>

2333
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:19,458
{\an8}<i>But who listens to the right things
in this country?</i>

2334
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:22,541
{\an8}<i>It's the need of the hour.
And someone should have spoken about it.</i>

2335
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,625
{\an8}<i>And the moment has started.</i>

2336
01:59:24,791 --> 01:59:25,708
{\an8}<i>It's brilliant.</i>

2337
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:27,833
All men should learn about foreplay.

2338
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:28,916
It's important, you know.

2339
01:59:29,041 --> 01:59:30,708
Brother Kanti is saying the right thing.

2340
01:59:30,791 --> 01:59:31,958
We are going to support him.

2341
01:59:32,125 --> 01:59:32,958
- Yes.
- That's right.

2342
01:59:33,041 --> 01:59:34,375
Of course, we must talk about it.

2343
01:59:37,875 --> 01:59:39,375
It's an important issue.

2344
01:59:39,583 --> 01:59:40,916
We must debate it.

2345
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:42,833
Yes. We must.

2346
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,541
<i>When we asked our pregnant teacher...</i>

2347
01:59:46,083 --> 01:59:48,083
"Ma'am, what happened?"

2348
01:59:48,583 --> 01:59:52,166
She said, "This is God's gift, dear".

2349
01:59:52,666 --> 01:59:56,416
If teachers are embarrassed to teach,
then they should call us.

2350
01:59:56,791 --> 01:59:57,791
We'll teach them.

2351
01:59:57,875 --> 02:00:00,375
{\an8}<i>Talking doesn't
make your tongue weaker,</i>

2352
02:00:00,708 --> 02:00:03,166
{\an8}<i>and staying silent
doesn't make it stronger.</i>

2353
02:00:03,708 --> 02:00:06,208
It's the same with private parts.

2354
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:09,750
Masturbation does not cause any harm.

2355
02:00:09,833 --> 02:00:12,083
While people are voicing their support,

2356
02:00:12,208 --> 02:00:15,125
a large section of society
is clearly denying it.

2357
02:00:17,041 --> 02:00:20,250
{\an8}<i>Kanti Sharan's court case
is becoming a hot topic for discussion</i>

2358
02:00:20,333 --> 02:00:22,250
{\an8}<i>for people from different
religions and sects.</i>

2359
02:00:22,833 --> 02:00:26,166
<i>Meanwhile, the school management
has refused to comment on it.</i>

2360
02:00:30,625 --> 02:00:32,375
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2361
02:00:32,583 --> 02:00:34,458
Kanti Sharan, leave the state!

2362
02:00:34,666 --> 02:00:36,416
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2363
02:00:36,541 --> 02:00:38,625
Kanti Sharan, leave the state!

2364
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,666
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2365
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:44,458
<i>How long will we keep teaching
our children through pseudonyms?</i>

2366
02:00:44,666 --> 02:00:48,666
<i>"Get him or her married, or else
he or she will cause us embarrassment."</i>

2367
02:00:48,958 --> 02:00:49,916
<i>You don't get it?</i>

2368
02:00:50,041 --> 02:00:52,291
<i>What's the point of hiding it
from children?</i>

2369
02:00:53,166 --> 02:00:54,041
<i>We'll talk to them.</i>

2370
02:00:54,125 --> 02:00:58,791
<i>Tell them what a good touch
and a bad touch is.</i>

2371
02:00:59,583 --> 02:01:02,041
<i>Only then will they be able
to talk to their parents</i>

2372
02:01:02,416 --> 02:01:03,583
<i>and explain to them.</i>

2373
02:01:16,708 --> 02:01:18,791
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2374
02:01:18,958 --> 02:01:20,791
Down with him!

2375
02:01:20,875 --> 02:01:22,750
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2376
02:01:22,833 --> 02:01:24,708
{\an8}Down with him!

2377
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:26,791
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2378
02:01:26,875 --> 02:01:28,541
Down with him!

2379
02:01:28,625 --> 02:01:30,583
Down with Kanti Sharan!

2380
02:01:30,666 --> 02:01:32,625
- Down with him!
- So, Mr. Kanti Sharan...

2381
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:35,833
forty-two police complaints
have been registered against you

2382
02:01:36,083 --> 02:01:37,875
from different religious organizations
across the country.

2383
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,583
For spreading vulgarity
and obscenity in the name of religion.

2384
02:01:40,750 --> 02:01:43,166
Twenty-two public interest litigations

2385
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:44,541
from various places.

2386
02:01:45,083 --> 02:01:46,666
And six non-bailable warrants.

2387
02:01:46,916 --> 02:01:48,000
Seventy-two in total.

2388
02:01:48,333 --> 02:01:49,750
And here's the 73rd one.

2389
02:01:50,916 --> 02:01:52,166
Summon from Guwahati city.

2390
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:54,333
You have to be present there.

2391
02:02:00,875 --> 02:02:02,625
- Indu...
- Today is the 14th.

2392
02:02:02,708 --> 02:02:03,708
Tomorrow is the 15th.

2393
02:02:04,041 --> 02:02:06,000
Tomorrow you have to be
present at Guwahati court.

2394
02:02:06,125 --> 02:02:09,083
There is no way you can
make it back by the 16th.

2395
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:10,416
Can you?

2396
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,333
No.

2397
02:02:11,416 --> 02:02:13,583
And if you don't go there,
you'll be arrested.

2398
02:02:13,875 --> 02:02:17,916
You see, the school has planned
a complete itinerary for you.

2399
02:02:19,083 --> 02:02:19,958
Hello.

2400
02:02:20,708 --> 02:02:21,541
Yes?

2401
02:02:21,625 --> 02:02:22,500
Okay.

2402
02:02:26,041 --> 02:02:28,083
Yes. Okay.

2403
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:34,083
Mr. Atal Nath Maheshwari wants to meet me.

2404
02:02:43,958 --> 02:02:47,875
Mr. Maheshwari is a decent man.

2405
02:02:48,458 --> 02:02:51,875
They want what's best for you
and your son.

2406
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:57,541
And this cheque is proof of that matter.

2407
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:00,125
One crore rupees.

2408
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:05,958
So that you can get Vivek
admitted to the largest,

2409
02:03:06,208 --> 02:03:08,333
and best boarding school in India.

2410
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:12,708
All that the school wants
is for you to appear in court...

2411
02:03:13,458 --> 02:03:14,833
and publicly apologize.

2412
02:03:15,541 --> 02:03:19,583
Sign on these settlement papers,

2413
02:03:20,458 --> 02:03:21,833
and withdraw your case.

2414
02:03:22,166 --> 02:03:24,000
Everyone benefits from this.

2415
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:26,291
Take it.

2416
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:29,166
Think about your son's future.

2417
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:30,791
Come on, take it.

2418
02:03:31,083 --> 02:03:32,958
Think about your son's future.

2419
02:03:33,083 --> 02:03:33,958
Say yes.

2420
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:35,416
Why won't he agree?

2421
02:03:37,125 --> 02:03:39,541
If as a father,
I'm serious about my son's future,

2422
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:44,291
he too wouldn't push
his son's future into darkness.

2423
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:47,750
Sign it.

2424
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,458
Sign it.

2425
02:03:59,125 --> 02:04:00,333
Just say yes.

2426
02:04:11,791 --> 02:04:13,708
<i>Forty-two police complaints
have been registered against you</i>

2427
02:04:13,833 --> 02:04:16,375
<i>Twenty-two public interest litigations
from various places.</i>

2428
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,458
<i>And six non-bailable warrants.</i>

2429
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:19,958
<i>There will be many more.</i>

2430
02:04:23,916 --> 02:04:27,250
<i>They will put you through
the machinery of law,</i>

2431
02:04:27,333 --> 02:04:29,291
<i>and turn you into chowder.</i>

2432
02:04:37,958 --> 02:04:41,083
<i>We'll lose our son due to this case.</i>

2433
02:05:40,916 --> 02:05:41,791
HAIL LORD MAHAKAAL

2434
02:06:12,791 --> 02:06:13,666
What...

2435
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,125
You are dead.

2436
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:21,791
Your family has been informed.

2437
02:06:28,958 --> 02:06:31,250
When you had left
your fate to Lord Shiva...

2438
02:06:32,875 --> 02:06:36,291
then why did you use your stupidity?

2439
02:06:37,875 --> 02:06:41,166
{\an8}I had come on His command,
following your invocation of Lord.

2440
02:06:42,166 --> 02:06:43,208
Who are you?

2441
02:06:44,208 --> 02:06:48,208
When I repeatedly told you, "Have
faith. You are Lord Shiva's disciple",

2442
02:06:48,416 --> 02:06:50,333
why did you abandon your faith?

2443
02:06:58,458 --> 02:06:59,375
Lord...

2444
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:01,958
are you really Lord Mahakaal's angel?

2445
02:07:02,333 --> 02:07:03,250
Why?

2446
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:07,416
Will you accept Him only if He
comes in His prevalent appearance?

2447
02:07:09,958 --> 02:07:11,291
Oh, follower of Shiva!

2448
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:13,458
You still don't believe me?

2449
02:07:18,583 --> 02:07:21,041
All you followers are unbelievable.

2450
02:07:21,666 --> 02:07:23,500
You all want live streaming.

2451
02:07:27,916 --> 02:07:31,500
<i>We worship the Tryambaka</i>

2452
02:07:31,583 --> 02:07:35,625
<i>Who is fragrant, increasing our
Spiritual core from the bondages</i>

2453
02:07:35,791 --> 02:07:38,750
<i>May I be liberated from death...</i>

2454
02:07:38,875 --> 02:07:42,458
Mahadev, how come You both look alike?

2455
02:07:42,666 --> 02:07:45,541
<i>Because Shiva and His followers,
the Shivgan,</i>

2456
02:07:45,750 --> 02:07:46,833
<i>are one and the same.</i>

2457
02:07:47,125 --> 02:07:48,833
- Maha...
<i>- You too are no different.</i>

2458
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,500
<i>You too have His essence.</i>

2459
02:07:51,166 --> 02:07:53,833
<i>The beautiful truth
that you speak fearlessly</i>

2460
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:55,708
<i>becomes Shiva's own words.</i>

2461
02:07:56,458 --> 02:07:58,666
<i>And you become a divine manifestation.</i>

2462
02:07:59,041 --> 02:08:00,125
My Lord!

2463
02:08:00,875 --> 02:08:03,833
He is gone, Kanti! Get up.

2464
02:08:03,958 --> 02:08:05,458
I'm your servant.

2465
02:08:06,291 --> 02:08:09,500
Help me, Lord Mahadev.

2466
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:10,583
Stand up.

2467
02:08:10,666 --> 02:08:12,458
Forgive me, Lord.
I made a huge mistake.

2468
02:08:12,541 --> 02:08:15,125
Punish me.
But please forgive me.

2469
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,666
- Stand up.
- Lord.

2470
02:08:16,833 --> 02:08:18,333
- Let go of my leg.
- I won't!

2471
02:08:18,416 --> 02:08:20,666
You'll ruin the crease. Let go.

2472
02:08:21,458 --> 02:08:26,250
A father got carried away
in emotions for his son.

2473
02:08:26,416 --> 02:08:27,958
Punish me, Lord!

2474
02:08:28,041 --> 02:08:29,375
Forgive me.

2475
02:08:31,041 --> 02:08:33,083
Today is the 16th.
Do you remember anything?

2476
02:08:33,166 --> 02:08:36,291
Do you know what happened
in the last 17 hours?

2477
02:08:37,041 --> 02:08:38,041
Look.

2478
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,416
Don't look at me.

2479
02:08:40,708 --> 02:08:42,583
Look at the consequences of your actions.

2480
02:08:45,416 --> 02:08:47,000
<i>This is his signed document.</i>

2481
02:08:48,875 --> 02:08:50,916
Sir, he did it all for money.

2482
02:08:51,083 --> 02:08:52,375
Pure extortion, sir.

2483
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:55,958
Sex education and all that
was just a drama.

2484
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:58,750
<i>But look at God's justice.</i>

2485
02:08:58,916 --> 02:09:00,166
<i>He met with an accident.</i>

2486
02:09:01,333 --> 02:09:02,458
I don't believe this.

2487
02:09:03,666 --> 02:09:04,625
Sad.

2488
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:08,416
<i>Anyway, if there has been
an out-of-court settlement,</i>

2489
02:09:08,958 --> 02:09:10,166
<i>I'll dismiss the case.</i>

2490
02:09:11,791 --> 02:09:13,541
Everything is finished, Lord.

2491
02:09:21,333 --> 02:09:22,583
There have been some positives as well.

2492
02:09:24,083 --> 02:09:25,708
<i>What else did Uncle do?</i>

2493
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:28,458
Like this...

2494
02:09:30,625 --> 02:09:31,708
and like this...

2495
02:09:32,458 --> 02:09:34,500
he would hold me.

2496
02:09:37,041 --> 02:09:38,583
He would kiss me here.

2497
02:09:40,541 --> 02:09:42,041
Kiss me here.

2498
02:09:44,375 --> 02:09:46,625
Kiss me here as well.

2499
02:09:51,875 --> 02:09:53,958
And he would kiss me over here.

2500
02:09:58,791 --> 02:10:01,833
He would give me a chocolate and leave.

2501
02:10:02,625 --> 02:10:03,500
Brother...

2502
02:10:04,541 --> 02:10:05,625
what is she saying?

2503
02:10:28,250 --> 02:10:29,375
There's more.

2504
02:10:29,458 --> 02:10:31,333
{\an8}Hello. This is Khyati Jain.

2505
02:10:31,416 --> 02:10:32,750
<i>You all are aware</i>

2506
02:10:32,833 --> 02:10:38,041
<i>of how a case of compensation
has taken such a grand proportion.</i>

2507
02:10:38,166 --> 02:10:41,125
<i>This day will go down
in the history of this city</i>

2508
02:10:41,291 --> 02:10:46,333
<i>because the court premises have never seen
such a large turnout of people.</i>

2509
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,000
<i>Folks from every corner of the country,</i>

2510
02:10:48,166 --> 02:10:50,166
<i>be it from an affluent family
or poor family,</i>

2511
02:10:50,250 --> 02:10:53,041
<i>children from schools
and colleges, youth, elderly,</i>

2512
02:10:53,166 --> 02:10:55,083
<i>everybody has gathered here.</i>

2513
02:10:55,166 --> 02:10:58,750
<i>Everyone is interested
in knowing who will win.</i>

2514
02:10:58,875 --> 02:11:01,750
<i>This is Khyati Jain,
with cameraman Sushant.</i>

2515
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,625
You owe them.

2516
02:11:05,250 --> 02:11:09,333
They stepped out of their homes
to support you.

2517
02:11:10,416 --> 02:11:11,791
What now, Lord?

2518
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:14,541
What should I do?

2519
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:16,125
Trust.

2520
02:11:18,791 --> 02:11:19,791
Have faith.

2521
02:11:21,250 --> 02:11:23,333
I'm Lord Shiva's disciple.

2522
02:11:27,416 --> 02:11:28,333
Lord!

2523
02:11:30,208 --> 02:11:31,125
Lord!

2524
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:33,750
<i>Hurry up, we're getting late.</i>

2525
02:11:33,833 --> 02:11:36,291
<i>I'm bringing the car around.
I have other things to do.</i>

2526
02:11:37,125 --> 02:11:40,166
<i>Your wife and children have been
praying all day at the temple.</i>

2527
02:11:57,208 --> 02:11:59,333
Can I see him one last time?

2528
02:11:59,750 --> 02:12:00,625
Please, doctor.

2529
02:12:01,875 --> 02:12:03,208
Of course, go on.

2530
02:12:10,791 --> 02:12:12,083
Where is he going?

2531
02:12:13,333 --> 02:12:14,583
To take one last look.

2532
02:12:14,666 --> 02:12:15,625
Whose last look?

2533
02:12:15,791 --> 02:12:17,708
Kanti... What?!

2534
02:12:18,416 --> 02:12:20,291
Brother, he said you were dead!

2535
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,208
He's the junior doctor.

2536
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:24,375
The senior doctor paid a visit.

2537
02:12:25,041 --> 02:12:26,916
He said, "You're absolutely alright.

2538
02:12:27,166 --> 02:12:28,458
You are free to go, Kanti."

2539
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:29,750
Junior?

2540
02:12:30,291 --> 02:12:33,041
But who is senior to me?

2541
02:12:33,583 --> 02:12:34,791
Doctor...

2542
02:12:35,708 --> 02:12:39,541
Those with evil deeds die a sudden death.

2543
02:12:39,666 --> 02:12:43,333
Even time cannot harm
a follower of Lord Mahakaal.

2544
02:12:43,583 --> 02:12:44,833
- Hail Lord Mahakaal.
- Hail Lord Mahakaal.

2545
02:12:47,791 --> 02:12:48,708
Kanti!

2546
02:12:49,458 --> 02:12:50,458
I have to go.

2547
02:12:50,916 --> 02:12:52,625
- Is your granddaughter okay?
- Yes.

2548
02:12:52,708 --> 02:12:54,250
But the bill...

2549
02:12:54,416 --> 02:12:56,500
I will pay the bill.

2550
02:13:00,041 --> 02:13:00,916
HAIL LORD MAHAKAAL

2551
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:10,666
Take a left. Take a left.
It's a shortcut.

2552
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,500
Court?!

2553
02:13:33,125 --> 02:13:35,000
Hurry up. You are already late.

2554
02:13:35,833 --> 02:13:36,833
Won't you come in?

2555
02:13:36,916 --> 02:13:38,875
I have to go fetch someone else.

2556
02:13:47,833 --> 02:13:49,625
Calm down. Be quiet.

2557
02:13:50,083 --> 02:13:52,083
Calm down.
I've lost my voice!

2558
02:13:52,166 --> 02:13:53,166
Calm down!

2559
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:54,583
Calm down, everyone!

2560
02:13:54,875 --> 02:13:56,416
Calm down!

2561
02:13:56,541 --> 02:13:58,500
I am tired of yelling!

2562
02:13:58,625 --> 02:13:59,833
Calm down!

2563
02:14:00,041 --> 02:14:01,583
- Make them calm down!
- Keep quiet!

2564
02:14:01,666 --> 02:14:02,625
Order!

2565
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:04,833
I am tired of yelling!

2566
02:14:04,916 --> 02:14:06,166
I've lost my voice!

2567
02:14:06,500 --> 02:14:07,458
Silence!

2568
02:14:07,625 --> 02:14:09,125
Saini, come here!

2569
02:14:09,208 --> 02:14:12,208
Let's just have the session
out in the open!

2570
02:14:12,291 --> 02:14:13,833
People want to hear!
Is anyone listening?

2571
02:14:13,916 --> 02:14:14,750
Make them calm down.

2572
02:14:14,833 --> 02:14:15,833
- Be quiet.
- Order!

2573
02:14:15,958 --> 02:14:17,125
- Hail Lord Mahadev.
- Calm down.

2574
02:14:17,250 --> 02:14:18,958
- Sit down, man!
- Mr. Kanti!

2575
02:14:19,041 --> 02:14:19,916
Yes, sir.

2576
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,083
You're alive?! I was told you
had a brain hemorrhage and...

2577
02:14:22,166 --> 02:14:23,666
That was yesterday, sir.
That was yesterday.

2578
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:24,708
I'm fine now.

2579
02:14:24,791 --> 02:14:26,666
- My family doctor...
- It's alright.

2580
02:14:26,750 --> 02:14:28,583
You withdrew your case, didn't you?

2581
02:14:28,708 --> 02:14:30,750
- No...
- You've put me in a difficult situation.

2582
02:14:30,833 --> 02:14:31,666
Wait a minute.

2583
02:14:31,750 --> 02:14:34,666
Sir, he withdrew the case
for one crore rupees.

2584
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:35,833
No, no...

2585
02:14:36,208 --> 02:14:37,500
Sir, I apologize.

2586
02:14:37,583 --> 02:14:42,666
They all lured a helpless father
with money and made him sign.

2587
02:14:42,916 --> 02:14:45,541
- What is this?
- Sir, I still have their cheque.

2588
02:14:45,666 --> 02:14:47,333
I haven't cashed it yet.

2589
02:14:47,583 --> 02:14:49,375
Please return it, sir.

2590
02:14:50,041 --> 02:14:51,708
He's refusing. He's denying it.

2591
02:14:51,916 --> 02:14:56,166
Sir, he has been making a mockery
of the court since day one.

2592
02:14:56,416 --> 02:14:58,458
Please, I request you
to dismiss the case.

2593
02:14:58,541 --> 02:14:59,833
This is not right, sir.

2594
02:14:59,958 --> 02:15:03,041
- He's doing it again.
- Ms. Kamini. Let me decide that, please.

2595
02:15:03,375 --> 02:15:04,333
{\an8}I'm here.

2596
02:15:04,541 --> 02:15:05,375
Sorry, sir.

2597
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:09,375
Alright.

2598
02:15:09,916 --> 02:15:11,500
Your closing statement, please.

2599
02:15:13,208 --> 02:15:15,458
I close my argument by stating...

2600
02:15:15,958 --> 02:15:20,291
for his son's personal,
indecent, and vulgar act,

2601
02:15:20,375 --> 02:15:23,166
the school is not responsible
and will never be.

2602
02:15:23,791 --> 02:15:27,500
If through books he wants to prove
that masturbation is correct,

2603
02:15:27,583 --> 02:15:31,166
then even I have several books
that say masturbation is wrong.

2604
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:35,875
In fact, for many religions,
it's immoral. It's a sin.

2605
02:15:35,958 --> 02:15:37,375
It is blasphemy, sir.

2606
02:15:38,333 --> 02:15:39,916
- Mr. Kanti.
- Sir, if...

2607
02:15:41,125 --> 02:15:44,125
Sir, if she is correct,

2608
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:45,958
then who are these people?

2609
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:47,708
And what are they doing here?

2610
02:15:48,166 --> 02:15:52,291
Somewhere deep inside, they believe
that sex education is important.

2611
02:15:52,375 --> 02:15:53,666
- That's why they are here.
- Give me that.

2612
02:15:55,416 --> 02:15:59,750
Sir, ask him where Vivek is in this crowd.

2613
02:16:00,208 --> 02:16:01,166
Where is he?

2614
02:16:01,750 --> 02:16:04,958
Is he ready to come back
to school with his head held high?

2615
02:16:05,041 --> 02:16:05,875
No.

2616
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:08,208
Because he knows he made a mistake.

2617
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:10,458
So, why...

2618
02:16:11,708 --> 02:16:13,708
- Look! He's here!
- He's here!

2619
02:16:40,083 --> 02:16:41,041
{\an8}PURSHOTTAM NAGAR

2620
02:16:44,583 --> 02:16:47,000
Sir, my son has done some research.

2621
02:16:52,291 --> 02:16:55,083
The story begins in 1835.

2622
02:16:55,250 --> 02:16:57,875
When a British officer Lord Macaulay,

2623
02:16:58,166 --> 02:17:00,833
who was on an excursion to India,

2624
02:17:01,166 --> 02:17:03,125
sent a report to the British government.

2625
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:05,708
"If we want to enslave India,

2626
02:17:05,791 --> 02:17:11,000
then their cultural
and educational heritage...

2627
02:17:11,958 --> 02:17:13,708
and the Gurukuls should be destroyed."

2628
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,250
The Gurukuls where sex education
was taught as well.

2629
02:17:18,916 --> 02:17:22,833
Thus the British Education Act 1835
was implemented.

2630
02:17:24,125 --> 02:17:28,791
Sadly, we have been
independent for 75 years,

2631
02:17:29,041 --> 02:17:33,083
but we still put our children through
the same educational system.

2632
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:35,791
These Britishers took our wisdom from us,

2633
02:17:36,041 --> 02:17:40,041
and became modern
by teaching sex education to Europe.

2634
02:17:40,416 --> 02:17:43,500
They reduced our image
to a land of snakes and scorpions.

2635
02:17:44,250 --> 02:17:45,166
Sir...

2636
02:17:46,041 --> 02:17:46,958
what is this?

2637
02:17:48,583 --> 02:17:49,500
Bestseller.

2638
02:17:50,208 --> 02:17:51,708
A bestseller in the world.

2639
02:17:53,375 --> 02:17:55,083
While we still keep
arguing among ourselves.

2640
02:17:56,375 --> 02:17:57,500
Isn't that your father?

2641
02:17:57,583 --> 02:17:59,166
- Yes, that's him.
- Give it to me.

2642
02:18:00,666 --> 02:18:03,041
Vivek, did you do the right thing?

2643
02:18:03,291 --> 02:18:04,375
Was it right?

2644
02:18:04,708 --> 02:18:06,000
Answer honestly, Vivek.

2645
02:18:09,750 --> 02:18:10,666
No, ma'am.

2646
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:12,750
- That's it, sir.
- Ma'am.

2647
02:18:15,708 --> 02:18:16,958
What I did...

2648
02:18:18,041 --> 02:18:19,458
wasn't wrong.

2649
02:18:20,791 --> 02:18:22,916
Yes, the place where I did it,
was my mistake.

2650
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
I'm sorry, sir.

2651
02:18:26,208 --> 02:18:27,083
Please...

2652
02:18:28,375 --> 02:18:29,791
take me back in school.

2653
02:18:31,791 --> 02:18:35,083
Sir, can you see how audaciously...

2654
02:18:35,833 --> 02:18:38,500
he's accepting that
he didn't do anything wrong?

2655
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:41,416
There are several kids in this crowd,

2656
02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:46,208
and I'm sure no one has the audacity
to say masturbation is correct.

2657
02:18:47,541 --> 02:18:50,041
Masturbation is a sin, Vivek.

2658
02:18:50,875 --> 02:18:52,000
Objection, My Lord!

2659
02:18:56,083 --> 02:18:57,166
No, it's not a sin.

2660
02:18:57,583 --> 02:18:58,500
I too masturbate.

2661
02:19:02,708 --> 02:19:04,125
Order! Order!

2662
02:19:04,833 --> 02:19:06,958
Did you come alone or with your parents?

2663
02:19:07,083 --> 02:19:08,083
With my father.

2664
02:19:08,375 --> 02:19:09,250
Where is your father?

2665
02:19:09,333 --> 02:19:11,000
I want to see your shameless father.

2666
02:19:12,958 --> 02:19:15,083
{\an8}He's the judge's son.

2667
02:19:22,416 --> 02:19:23,708
We need sex education.

2668
02:19:24,041 --> 02:19:25,166
Yes. Me too.

2669
02:19:27,625 --> 02:19:28,958
Talk to us about periods.

2670
02:19:29,208 --> 02:19:30,666
We need sex education.

2671
02:19:30,791 --> 02:19:31,958
Yes, we do.

2672
02:19:32,375 --> 02:19:33,625
- Yes, I agree with that.
- I agree!

2673
02:19:33,750 --> 02:19:35,250
- Me too!
- Me too!

2674
02:19:35,333 --> 02:19:37,000
- Me too!
- Me too!

2675
02:19:37,125 --> 02:19:38,625
- Me too.
- Me too.

2676
02:19:38,708 --> 02:19:40,041
We need sex education.

2677
02:19:40,125 --> 02:19:41,791
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah!

2678
02:19:57,583 --> 02:20:00,166
DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT

2679
02:20:20,416 --> 02:20:21,625
I'm not shameless.

2680
02:20:24,041 --> 02:20:24,875
I'm not.

2681
02:20:26,541 --> 02:20:27,416
I'm lucky.

2682
02:20:29,333 --> 02:20:31,500
I'm lucky that my father
realized his mistake.

2683
02:20:32,416 --> 02:20:33,625
And he fought for me.

2684
02:20:37,916 --> 02:20:40,708
But, ma'am, tell me one thing.

2685
02:20:42,416 --> 02:20:44,041
Who is going to explain to me

2686
02:20:44,166 --> 02:20:46,250
the terms that appear
when we type "sex" on Google?

2687
02:20:46,375 --> 02:20:48,583
There are terms like abuse, violence...

2688
02:20:49,458 --> 02:20:50,875
Who will define them for me?

2689
02:20:51,083 --> 02:20:52,708
Sexually transmitted disease.

2690
02:20:52,791 --> 02:20:54,458
Inappropriate sexual behavior.

2691
02:20:54,583 --> 02:20:55,916
Unwanted pregnancies.

2692
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,250
Misogynistic attitude.

2693
02:20:57,333 --> 02:20:59,458
Good touch, bad touch, consent.

2694
02:20:59,541 --> 02:21:01,416
Making someone's video and uploading it...

2695
02:21:01,875 --> 02:21:03,083
which I was a victim of.

2696
02:21:04,208 --> 02:21:05,291
It's too vast.

2697
02:21:06,583 --> 02:21:07,708
Whatever happened to me,

2698
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:10,875
what I had to go through,
my family had to go through...

2699
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:14,375
I don't want anyone
else to experience this.

2700
02:21:18,041 --> 02:21:19,041
Please, sir.

2701
02:21:35,208 --> 02:21:36,291
Ms. Kamini.

2702
02:21:39,458 --> 02:21:40,375
Ms. Kamini.

2703
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:43,916
Ms. Kamini!

2704
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:49,541
Is there anything you'd like to say?

2705
02:21:54,958 --> 02:21:56,750
{\an8}Savoday International School...

2706
02:21:57,833 --> 02:21:58,833
{\an8}Dr. Shah...

2707
02:21:59,791 --> 02:22:01,041
Inder Medical...

2708
02:22:02,125 --> 02:22:03,708
and Pranlal Muthut.

2709
02:22:04,208 --> 02:22:05,333
The fact that...

2710
02:22:06,166 --> 02:22:09,958
they gave Kanti Sharan Mudgal a cheque

2711
02:22:10,083 --> 02:22:13,500
proves that they
consider themselves guilty.

2712
02:22:13,875 --> 02:22:15,541
And it's very ironic

2713
02:22:15,875 --> 02:22:20,375
that Savoday International School, which
is affiliated with the British curriculum,

2714
02:22:21,375 --> 02:22:25,708
doesn't want to teach
the British sex education syllabus.

2715
02:22:26,750 --> 02:22:28,041
The court agrees

2716
02:22:28,250 --> 02:22:30,083
that Savoday International School

2717
02:22:30,500 --> 02:22:32,250
and the education board are responsible

2718
02:22:33,166 --> 02:22:35,625
for Vivek's plight.

2719
02:22:36,208 --> 02:22:37,166
The court

2720
02:22:38,208 --> 02:22:40,416
instructs the education board

2721
02:22:40,541 --> 02:22:43,708
to make reforms
in the syllabus as soon as possible.

2722
02:22:44,333 --> 02:22:45,333
And all you people...

2723
02:22:46,583 --> 02:22:50,208
quickly pay 11, 21, 51, and 101 rupees

2724
02:22:50,666 --> 02:22:57,291
to Kanti Sharan Mudgal
as compensation right away

2725
02:22:57,375 --> 02:22:59,125
so he can offer it to Lord Mahadev.

2726
02:22:59,625 --> 02:23:03,166
And I order the school
to take strict action against those

2727
02:23:03,291 --> 02:23:04,583
who made Vivek's video.

2728
02:23:05,166 --> 02:23:08,750
{\an8}And court orders Vivek
to be taken back in school.

2729
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:12,416
{\an8}Same class, same bench.

2730
02:23:46,041 --> 02:23:48,208
Congratulations and sorry.

2731
02:23:49,291 --> 02:23:50,666
Do you know why you won?

2732
02:23:52,208 --> 02:23:55,000
Because you were
fighting for your family...

2733
02:23:56,166 --> 02:23:57,208
and I was fighting for business.

2734
02:23:58,458 --> 02:24:00,166
I'll always remember
this case, Mr. Kanti.

2735
02:24:01,083 --> 02:24:01,958
Thank you.

2736
02:24:06,500 --> 02:24:07,500
- Vivek!
- Bro!

2737
02:24:07,583 --> 02:24:09,583
- Bravo, Kanti.
- Greetings.

2738
02:24:10,208 --> 02:24:12,458
You completely changed my ideology.

2739
02:24:12,541 --> 02:24:13,708
Congratulations.

2740
02:24:13,791 --> 02:24:15,833
How did you get well so soon?

2741
02:24:16,083 --> 02:24:17,791
- I met a doctor.
- Where is he?

2742
02:24:17,875 --> 02:24:19,541
Over there.
Come, I'll introduce you to him.

2743
02:24:20,375 --> 02:24:22,166
- The guy who cured you?
- Yes.

2744
02:24:25,916 --> 02:24:28,000
Hail Lord Mahadev!

2745
02:24:28,375 --> 02:24:30,416
Hail Lord Mahadev!

2746
02:24:30,791 --> 02:24:32,708
Hail Lord Mahadev!

2747
02:24:33,708 --> 02:24:35,291
Indu, he's the doctor.

2748
02:24:36,541 --> 02:24:38,666
You are God for us.

2749
02:24:38,916 --> 02:24:39,833
Absolutely.

2750
02:24:44,375 --> 02:24:45,750
What are you doing?

2751
02:24:45,875 --> 02:24:47,666
It's for Lord Mahakaal.

2752
02:24:47,750 --> 02:24:49,916
Be quiet. This is his fee.

2753
02:24:51,833 --> 02:24:53,708
Really? 285 rupees?

2754
02:24:55,791 --> 02:24:57,125
Kanti, we're even now.

2755
02:24:58,708 --> 02:25:00,250
Now give me back my bag.

2756
02:25:00,833 --> 02:25:01,708
What bag?

2757
02:25:02,333 --> 02:25:04,208
The bag that your son is carrying.

2758
02:25:05,791 --> 02:25:07,666
Is that your bag?

2759
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,291
- Give it back, son.
- Here you go.

2760
02:25:13,666 --> 02:25:14,708
You know what?

2761
02:25:15,333 --> 02:25:16,541
Keep it with you.

2762
02:25:17,750 --> 02:25:19,458
From today, it's your responsibility.

2763
02:25:19,916 --> 02:25:21,000
- Okay?
- Yes.

2764
02:25:24,750 --> 02:25:26,625
Alright, I'll take your leave.

2765
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:28,416
You cannot leave like this, doctor.

2766
02:25:28,500 --> 02:25:30,208
Let's go and seek
Lord Mahakaal's blessings.

2767
02:25:30,416 --> 02:25:31,750
Let's see the Bhasm Aarti.

2768
02:25:31,833 --> 02:25:33,416
- Give us a chance...
- No.

2769
02:25:34,041 --> 02:25:35,125
I must go.

2770
02:25:35,583 --> 02:25:37,541
One more patient is waiting for me.

2771
02:25:37,916 --> 02:25:39,375
Hail Lord Mahadev!

2772
02:25:43,208 --> 02:25:44,583
Which doctor is he?

2773
02:25:44,666 --> 02:25:47,375
- What is his name?
- Dr. Mahadev.

2774
02:25:47,833 --> 02:25:49,125
What's his surname?

2775
02:25:49,708 --> 02:25:52,041
Har Har.
Dr. Mahadev Har Har.

2776
02:25:52,166 --> 02:25:53,541
He alleviates everyone's pain.

2777
02:25:53,625 --> 02:25:55,791
Move. He drives pretty fast.

2778
02:26:01,083 --> 02:26:02,291
<i>Hail Nandi.</i>
