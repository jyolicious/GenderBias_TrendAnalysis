WHO VALIANTLY FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY
AND FOR HUMANITY.

00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,458
THIS FILM IS A TRIBUTE TO THE FEARLESS
AIR WARRIORS OF THE INDIAN AIR FORCE,

6
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,750
PAST AND PRESENT, WHO HAVE DEDICATED
THEIR LIVES TO DEFENDING OUR SKIES

7
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,750
AND BORDERS WITH UNPARALLELED COURAGE
AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT.

00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,708
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE INDIA

00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,666
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO
THE INDIAN AIR FORCE

00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:57,833
As-Salaam-Alaikum.
My name is Faizan Hamid.

11
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,125
I joined Jaish one year ago.

12
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,375
And after waiting for one whole year,

13
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,666
by God's grace that day has arrived

14
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,166
when I am about
to accomplish my life's purpose.

15
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,166
This is my last message to Kashmir.

16
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,791
By the time you watch this video,
I will be in heaven.

17
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,083
My fight is for Kashmir.

18
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,541
My fight is for freedom.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,916
Inshallah.

20
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,833
ONE YEAR AGO

21
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,208
{\an8}<i>We have just received
breaking news from Srinagar...</i>

{\an8}MANSEHRA, PAKISTAN 2018

23
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,958
<i>that "Operation All Out"
has succeeded.</i>

24
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,500
{\an8}<i>The most dangerous militant
of the Kashmir valley, Ruhaan Ghani,</i>

25
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:40,416
<i>has been shot down by
the Indian army after a 48-hour operation.</i>

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,583
<i>This special operation
by the Indian government</i>

27
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,041
{\an8}<i>has eradicated almost all
traces of terrorism in the state.</i>

28
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,833
Years of our hard work

29
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,708
has been destroyed
in just a few weeks by the Indians.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,500
All our warriors who believe in a
free Kashmir will soon be captured.

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,583
It took so much effort to spread
terror throughout the Kashmir valley.

32
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,250
What are you planning, Maqsood?

33
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,666
I am bringing in a Jihadi...

34
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,875
whose caliber has never
been seen before by the Indians.

35
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,541
He carried out many operations
for us in Afghanistan

36
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,958
<i>and its neighboring nations.</i>

37
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,791
The nightclub bombing in Istanbul,

38
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,458
<i>the bombing
of the Indian Embassy in Kabul,</i>

39
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,833
<i>the bombing in Mazar-i-Sharif.</i>

40
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:43,291
No one understands
explosives better than him.

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,208
The General is from ISI

42
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,750
and Majeed belongs
to Jaish of Independent Kashmir.

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,458
The ones you wanted to meet.

44
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,875
I have heard a lot about you
and now we are finally meeting.

45
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,916
If you need anything from us,
we'll be happy to help.

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,708
I have a task for which I need you.

47
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,291
But you...

48
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,875
aren't worthy of executing it.

49
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,375
Last time, during the Mumbai
attacks of 26/11

50
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,708
you made the mistake
of sending Pakistani boys.

51
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,625
They were identified,

52
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,500
and your motives were exposed,

53
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,958
leading to your country
facing humiliation across the globe.

54
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,916
This time,
we won't involve anyone from Pakistan.

55
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,541
We will flood the Indian soil
with their own blood.

56
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,625
We will attack their
most well-guarded area.

57
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,500
The heart of the Indian military.

58
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
Srinagar Air Force Station.

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,375
{\an8}- Good morning, sir.
- Sir! Good morning, sir.

66
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:30,000
{\an8}At ease, boys. Why don't you relax
a bit before getting the bad news?

67
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,250
{\an8}Bad news, sir?

68
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:32,708
{\an8}We received urgent posting orders.

69
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,041
{\an8}I am sure Air Headquarters didn't call
us to Kashmir for some fun river rafting.

70
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,708
{\an8}Am I right?

71
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,833
When I told my parents that
I was going to heaven...

72
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,541
my mom was really scared.

73
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,416

{\an8}You're married, bro.

79

{\an8}Couldn't you have waited a bit
before reminding me?

80
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,208
Hi, Jeet. Good to see you.

Rathore?

84
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,833
Weren't you the one who was
awarded the Vayu Sena Medal

85
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,000
{\an8}for the rescue operation
in Operation Desert Hound?

86
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,125
{\an8}I was lucky I was nearby
and could land my chopper.

87
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,875
{\an8}Fortune only favors the brave, ma'am.

88
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,458
{\an8}I am really happy to meet you...
also a little scared.

89
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,375
Why?

90
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,000
{\an8}Happy because a decorated
hero like you is on our team.

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,166
{\an8}And scared, because if a decorated
hero like you is in our team

92
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,083
{\an8}that means that the danger level
is definitely going to be very high.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,875
{\an8}What?

94
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,625
{\an8}Actually, I should've
guessed at that very moment

95
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,833
{\an8}when I heard that he was coming.

96
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,208
Who is coming?

97
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,583
{\an8}Him.

98
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,916
{\an8}So... Sorry.

99
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,416
{\an8}Him.

requesting permission
for a low inverted run.

104
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,666
{\an8}No way.

105
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,125
Is he joining your team?

106
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,250
{\an8}<i>Requesting permission

107
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,750

It's our first day, Patty.

111
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,125
At least let me see the runway

Meet Taj.

128
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,666
- Hi, Taj.
- He is one of my oldest friends.

129
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,708
He means our friendship
is old, I am not old.

130
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,583
Hey!

131
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,333

A little?

142
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,208
You missed the whole briefing, Sukhi.

143
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,583
What?

144
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,375
The CO is very angry.

145
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,333
Oh, no!

146
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,666
Didn't you know that
the briefing time had been changed?

147
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,125
Oh, man...

148

151
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,750
{\an8}I thought it was at eight but...
I am really very sorry, sir.

152
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,541
{\an8}Relax, young man.

153
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,833
{\an8}Briefing begins in 05 minutes.

154
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:35,583
{\an8}Okay, sir.

155
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,208
What is this, dude? Did you have
to do your first missile strike on me?

156
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,208
This is not fair.

157
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,791
{\an8}Sorry man, but our speed
as fighter pilots is very fast.

158
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,291
{\an8}You and your helicopters will need
to be a bit faster to catch up with us.

159
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,291
Friendly fire on day one.

160
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,583
When the need arises, it will only
be Sukhi and I who will rescue you.

161
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,083
If the need arises.

162

Your CO.

We are Air Dragons.

170
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,166
You all are top aviators
in the Indian Air Force.

171
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,708
And that's why you were hand-picked
by us to form a quick response team.

172
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,375
Militant activities across
the LoC are spiraling out of control.

173
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,791
{\an8}This is why Air headquarters
has decided that our unit

174
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,083
will be the first one to tackle them.

175
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:38,000
{\an8}There are three attributes that
will make us better air warriors.

176
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,375
Practice, practice, and more practice.

177
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,083
The more you sweat in here,

178
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,875
the less you will bleed in war.

179
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,250
{\an8}SHAMSHER PATHANIA

180
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,833
This is Wing Commander Harish Nautiyal.

181
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,416
Call sign Nauty,

182
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,833
an experienced Sukhoi pilot.

183
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,208
My number two.

184
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,375
Let's do a quick warm-up...

185
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,291
to understand the attributes
of each other's aircraft.

186
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,708
What is the top speed
of an ALH helicopter?

187
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,166
- Two hundred and ninety kilometers.
- Right.

188
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,833
{\an8}- And how many passengers can it carry?
- Twelve.

189
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,083
{\an8}Fourteen.

190
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,708
{\an8}With high-density seating.

191
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,500
Both answers are correct,
but we can only

192
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,125
achieve the full potential of
the machine if we think aggressively.

193
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,083
Sukhoi 30, maximum height it can fly?

194
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,458
Fifty-six thousand feet.

195
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,625
Speed?

196
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,958
{\an8}Twice the speed of sound.

197
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,208
{\an8}Twenty-one hundred kilometers per hour.

198
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,958
And for how long can a Sukhoi
remain airborne?

199
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,125
Three and a half hours.

200
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,208
{\an8}Ten.

201
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,583
{\an8}Ten hours with air-to-air refueling, sir.

202
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,333
{\an8}Think aggressively, guys.

203
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,625
Patty is right.

204
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,000
Apart from your
personal skillsets,

205
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:55,333
you are all here
to form a cohesive team.

206
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,583
Individually, you all are the best
combat aviators in the Indian Air Force.

207
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,708
Now let's become the best
combat team in the world.

208
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,125
AIR DRAGONS INDIAN AIR FORCE
I SEE EVERYTHING

209
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,291
In this unit, there is no
room for arrogance and ego...

210
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,708
or fancy stunts.

211
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,375
We start training tomorrow.
Take some rest.

212
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,125
Get to know each other.

213
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,500
{\an8}Bond with each other.

214
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,000
{\an8}It's your interpersonal relationships
that will help you win in war.

215
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,500
{\an8}Remember, the one who plays alone,

216
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,833
plays against the team.

217
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,375
- Any questions or doubts?
- No, sir.

218
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,500
Dismissed.

219
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,750
I think I should change my
call sign to Rambo.

220
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,416
I am sure that will make Rocky happy.

221
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,708
{\an8}Guys, we have been asked to bond.
What should we do? Any ideas?

222
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,125
- Let's go to the gym!
- Hell, no!

223
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,291
Should we go eat?

224
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,250
- Yes!
- I like it.

225
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,291
{\an8}Sir, will you be joining us or...

226
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,250
{\an8}We heard that you prefer Zomato.

227
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,416
<i>Latest news for today,
the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed</i>

228
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
<i>Maulana Maqsood Abrar
made a declaration.</i>

229
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:11,125
<i>The Indian army has killed
another one of our brothers.</i>

230
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,208
<i>If even this incident doesn't flame
the fire</i>

231
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,875
<i>in our Kashmiri hearts then what will?</i>

232
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,416
<i>Until we Kashmiris
decide to take to arms...</i>

233
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,458
{\an8}<i>That's the day we will decide...</i>

234
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,500
Look, that's an officer
from the Indian Air Force.

235
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,125
Our mission is not
to kill just one soldier...

236
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,541
but to destroy
the entire Indian military.

237
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,000
Patty!

238
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,875
Welcome to Srinagar, Saachi.

239
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,083
God, it's so good to see you.

240
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,083
It's been so long...

241
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:31,750
Two years.

242
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,375
And we've been
married for five years.

243
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,791
I don't know why but whenever he
talks to you, I feel very insecure.

244
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:38,791
Cutie-pie.

245
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,291
By the way, Taj.

246
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,208
- I have known Patty longer than you.
- That's true.

247
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,875
- Guys, our table is ready, come.
- Yeah, actually!

248
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,250
- Let's go! I am starving!
- Come!

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,458
- Have you been okay?
- Yeah, I have been okay.

250
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,833
Have you ever thought
that when we are hungry...

251
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,500
- At your service, sir.
- I am famished!

252
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,500
Sukhi sir, you're always late!

253
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,041
Jokes apart, order something.
I am hungry.

254
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,041
May I?

255
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,333
Sure.

256
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,708
Or am I too boring for you?

257
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,125
I don't know about boring but
you are definitely sarcastic.

258
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:08,958
Guys, I have ordered
<i>rogan josh,</i> and <i>wazwan.</i>

259
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,375
- Yummy!
- And if there are any vegetarians...

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,166
please come tomorrow.

261
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,708
Hey, order <i>palak paneer</i> for me.

262
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,166
- I heard it's worth dying for.
- Yeah.

263
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,166
Well, that's nice, we came here
to give our lives for our country...

264
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,791
you can give your
life for paneer instead.

265
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,500
Nice one!

266
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,250
By the way, Patty.

267
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,416
Taj was telling me stories about
your academy days.

268
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,041
Something about your famous smile...

269
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,583
The "please" smile.

270
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,708
- I can't believe it.
- Whenever we stepped out from the academy

271
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,083
it was Patty's duty to get us a lift.

272
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,500
And he would always say please
and flash that smile of his.

273
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,625
And everyone... even girls!

274
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,333
What do you mean by "even" girls?

275
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,958
- What are you trying to say, man?
- Any kind of living being,

276
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,125
would let him in their car without
asking any questions, remember?

277
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,083
It's a good thing that
he only asked for a lift.

278
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,375
How is that even funny?

279
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:11,041
I want to see a demo of this.

280
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,958
That biryani... on their table...

281
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,416
What about it?

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,916
I want it.

283
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:22,958
Yeah, right.

284
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,958
- Come on Patty. Come on.
- Too easy. Too easy.

285
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,750
Forget about staying
airborne for ten hours,

286
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,541
some people can't
even take off from the runway.

287
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,375
You will have to do it now, Patty!

288
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,125
Hello?

289
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,375
Hi.

290
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,291
Sorry, I don't mean to disturb but...

291
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,291
I just wanted to ask you
if they serve good biryani here.

292
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,375
We could tell you
if you let us eat it.

293
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,125
Actually, we were wondering

294
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,291
if we could taste some
biryani before we order it.

295
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,791
I mean, if you don't mind.

296
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,791
Can you share some
of your biryani with us?

297
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:14,958
Please?

298
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,208
Please?

299
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,333
Yes, okay.

300
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,916
We couldn't have finished
the whole thing anyway.

301
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,875
- That is so sweet of you.
- I have quit eating rice.

302
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,541
- Really?
- Actually, I am dieting.

303
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,958
Take my plate too.

304
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,625
- Waiter?
- Yes, ma'am.

305
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:38,875
What are the options for sugar-free?

306
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,125
Make it two.

307
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,916
So sweet. Thank you.

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,916
No problem.

309
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,166
You're welcome.

310
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,708
What?

311
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,000
Told you!

312
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,916
I told you...

313
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:54,500
it's too easy.

314
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,791
Biryani for you.

315
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,291
Anybody else? Biryani? Anyone?

316
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,166
This is a superpower, sir.

317
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,708
-Black magic
-Black magic, sir.

318
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,375
Still got it, man!

319
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,916
So Minni, when did you decide
to join the Air Force?

320
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,416
Since my childhood.

321
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,625
It was my dream to become a pilot.

322
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,125
Actually, thanks to Dad,

323
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,583
I would watch aircraft
taking off and landing every day.

324
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,291
Your dad was in the Air Force?

325
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,541
No, Air Bharat. Ground Operations.

326
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,083
Then why did you choose
to be an Air Force pilot?

327
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,416
Because some people felt
that I wouldn't be able to do it.

328
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,416
What's wrong with you?

329
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,833
Hey, guys!

330
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,791
I can feel a joke coming.

331
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,458
Who can stop you? Go ahead.

332
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,875
- How is the <i>gosht?</i>
- Tasty, sir!

333
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,958
Sir, that paneer was delicious.

334
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,500
I am so full.

335
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,625
You want to eat <i>phirni,</i> correct?

336
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,458
- Yeah.
- Saachi and her <i>phirnis.</i>

337
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,458
Anyone else?

338
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,416
- One for me.
- Me too.

339
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,583
- I'll accompany you.
- Thank you.

340
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,375
It's within walking distance.

341
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,583
I don't need a chopper. So...

342
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,583
I think I will manage.

343
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,458
Is he a son
of an Air Marshal or a General?

344
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:21,708
No, Uncle was an upper-division clerk
in the Public Works Department of Jammu.

345
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,208
Now he's retired.

346
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,541
I have never seen a pilot with
so much attitude.

347
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,208
That's the thing.

348
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,041
He doesn't consider himself a pilot.

349
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,541
So what does he consider himself as?

350
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,208
{\an8}SHAMSHER PATHANIA

351
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,625

{\an8}<i>I know the day we part</i>

{\an8}<i>My one true love</i>

382
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,416
The Indian military
bases have been turned

383
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,750
into fortresses after
the Uri and Pathankot attacks.

384
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,625
It's impossible to infiltrate
into the Srinagar Air Base now.

385
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,375
So what is the plan now, Azhar?

386
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,583
Faizan and Waseem are waiting
at the Shalimar Bagh hideout.

387
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,000
The RDX belt is in the shikara outside.

388
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,041
Brother?

389
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,291
Everything will be
transported through the lake now.

390
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,166
We will neither have to worry
about the checkpoints

391
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,833
nor will there be
any fear of accidents.

392
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,458
I will meet you there.

393
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,583
Halt! Don't move!

394
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,041
{\an8}The information is correct, sir.

395
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,083
This amount of RDX
can blow up a hotel.

396
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:36,625
What will happen now, Brother?

397
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,416
An explosion.

398
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,333
For today's training mission,

399
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,250
choppers will drop
the commandos here at Baltal

400
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:53,583
and will wait there till
the commandos destroy the mock target.

401
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,208
In exactly 15 minutes,

402
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,041
the choppers will pick up
the commandos from the same drop point.

403
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:00,625
Taj and Patty.

404
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,875
You will provide air cover
to the choppers.

405
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,708
And Taj, you will lead this.

406
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,500
Nauty and I will be
your enemies for today.

407
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:16,416
Our objective is to shoot
down those choppers.

408
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,625
And your objective
is to protect them.

409
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,458
We know how
advanced our aircraft are

410
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:24,833
but what we want to see is
how advanced...

411
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,208
{\an8}are our fighter pilots.

412
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,250
Reaching the drop
point in two minutes,

413
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:33,083
commandos, prepare for the drop.

414
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,916
Commandos, ready to go!

415
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,000
Minni, we are providing you cover.
Visibility is good as of now.

416
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:39,708
The enemy can't hide from us.

417
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,541
Stay alert, guys. Rocky and Nauty
can show up any second.

418
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:44,000
Green on. Go.

419
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,083
How is it going?

420
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,166
Has the enemy been spotted yet?

421
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,333
Not yet, sir.

422
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,375
Bogey. Two o'clock!

423
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,333
Alright, visual contact.
I am going after him.

424
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,458
Wait, Patty, we need
to protect the choppers.

425
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:01,916
I will handle this one, you handle
the other one, Taj.

426
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,291
Sir, someone is chasing us.

427
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,541
I know who it is.

428
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,791
Some people never change.

429
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,541
ROCKY

430
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,458
PATTY

431
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:15,958
Smart move by Rocky,

432
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,583
he has lured Patty
away from the choppers.

433
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,000
Where is Nauty?

434
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,875
NAUTY

435
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,416
{\an8}Nauty is too close to the choppers,

436
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,333
let's see how Taj manages
to protect them.

437
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,791
{\an8}Guys, the task is about to end.

438
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,708
{\an8}The commandos will
be back in two minutes.

439
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,833
Fall back, Patty.
The task is about to end.

440
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,291
The target is on my radar, Taj.
I am not going to spare him.

441
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,291
Oh, shit! Another Fighter
near the choppers!

442
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,708
What the hell, guys?

443
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,250
Caught you, Minni!
Sukhi, you are next.

444
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,875
- Come on, Taj! Let's get him!
- Yeah!

445
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,583
Taj, this bogey is in my range.

446
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,041
You protect Sukhi.

447
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:01,958
Almost there...

448
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,041
Sir, they're locking
their missile on us.

449
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,083
Let him.

450
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,458
Diving right! Hold tight!

451
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,125
Damn, Unni! He peeled off.

452
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,416
Do you see him?

453
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,875
UNNI

454
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:22,833
Negative, Patty.

455
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,916
- Patty! He is on our tail!
- Oh, shit.

456
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,708
You are done for, Patty.

457
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:35,625
{\an8}Patty, his missile is about
to lock on us. He has almost locked.

458
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,791
Do something, Patty.

459
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,000
Come on.

460
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,125
Patty, he has almost locked us.

461
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,791
Shake him off, Patty!

462
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,000
Do something, Patty!

463
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,958
Shake him off, Patty!

464
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,791
- Initiating lock.
<i>- Patty, he is on our tail.</i>

465
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,458
<i>At eight o'clock.
We've got time, come on...</i>

466
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,208
Lock. Lock. Lock.

467
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:56,750
Patty, he has almost locked us.

468
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,625
And locked.

469
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,458
We got him, Unni!

470
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,708
Yes, Patty!

471
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,166
You failed the mission, Patty.

472
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,333
What?

473
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:25,416
How?

474
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,250
Because Nauty got Minni and Sukhi

475
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,916
<i>and you failed to protect the choppers.</i>

476
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,375
Meet me at the base. Now!

477
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,875
Damn it, Patty! Damn it!

478
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,333
It's your fault.

479
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,291
This is all your fault, Taj.

480
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:49,791
{\an8}You were the
leader of this team.

481
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,083
But it looks like you have
no control over this team.

482
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,875
{\an8}This is not Taj's fault, sir.

483
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:02,625
{\an8}As soon as I spotted
the enemy Sukhoi I went after it.

484
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:06,208
By pulling a fancy
stunt over Taj, right?

485
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,750
If someone had to go after us
that should have been Taj.

486
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:12,458
Don't you trust, Taj?

487
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,416
I would have tackled one
and Taj would have handled...

488
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,416
Incorrect tactics!

489
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,625
What was your mission?

490
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:20,166
Attacking the enemy
or protecting the choppers?

491
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,125
Sir, handling the enemy jet was
essential to protect the choppers.

492
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:24,958
And what if there were
more than two fighter jets?

493
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:29,625
The enemy won't tell you their exact
strength before attacking you in a war!

494
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,208
You failed your team today.

495
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:34,208
Don't fail your country tomorrow.

496
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,041
Zero marks!

497
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,666
I defeated the best pilot, sir.

498
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,500
Won't I get any marks for that?

499
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,916
You either win or lose a war.

500
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,750
There is no "Man of the Match" award.

501
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,041
Once again, because of your mistake,

502
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,416
the chopper pilots are dead.

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,166
don't mind what I am about to say.

518
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,416
You are this team's strength.

519
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:24,750
But you have to accept that
this team can also be your strength.

520
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,375
- Come, let me make you a drink.
- No, I will do it myself.

521
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:37,750
It's okay man, can't I make
a new drink for a new friend?

522
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:40,875
Yeah.

523
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:42,416
Can someone tell me...

524
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,958
why does pizza taste
better on the next day?

525
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:49,500
- I know.
- I wish I could say the same about Taj.

526
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,458
"I wish I could say
the same about Taj." I knew it!

527
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,458
- Have a drink.
- Shut up!

528
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,708
Patty, can you recite the poem you
used to tell us in the academy days?

529
00:33:59,041 --> 00:33:59,916
No, man.

530
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,958
{\an8}Look, we have the vibe,
the people, and pizza!

531
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,166
{\an8}So, please don't say no.
Come on, let us hear it.

532
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,875
Please. You recite it really well.

533
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,166
Do it, otherwise...
I will just recite it very badly.

534
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,000
- Patty, come on!
- Lovers...

535
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,208
"You will find many
lovers in this world...

536
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,791
You will find many
lovers in this world

537
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,833
but no lover can compete with
the love you have for your country.

538
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,625
Many die in a coffin wrapped in diamonds,
many die wrapped in gold,

539
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,958
but there can be no coffin more beautiful
than a coffin wrapped in Tricolor."

540
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,541
- Wow!
- Amazing, dude!

541
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:34,125
Wow!

542
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:38,791
That was superb!

543
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:42,000
Hey, guys.
I just remembered another one.

544
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,750
- It's very deadly. I swear.
- No!

545
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:46,458
- No, no, no.
- When the bell was ringing...

546
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:48,250
- No, no, that's enough. Please.
- No!

547
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,583
Taj, please, no!

548
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:57,958
You're flying solo here too?

549
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,416
Can I ask you something
if you don't mind?

550
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:11,625
You are a single child, aren't you?

551
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,583
Is it that obvious?

552
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:19,333
Loners like you are usually
found in smaller families.

553
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:20,750
I see.

554
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:22,416
Okay...

555
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,208
Let me guess.

556
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,333
You probably have a large family.

557
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,500
And I am sure they love you a lot.

558
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,500
In fact, they probably
tell everyone they meet

559
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,375
that their daughter
is an Air Force pilot.

560
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,541
Correct?

561
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,083
Oops.

562
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,041
Hit a nerve?

563
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:49,375
Yes, you did.

564
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,458
What is the problem... if
you don't mind me asking?

565
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:06,000
The day my dad signed my Air Force
consent form he considered me a martyr.

566
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,208
He wanted me to finish
my studies and get married.

567
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,000
Air Force is not for girls.

568
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,666
That is the last thing
he said to me.

569
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,333
It's not his fault.

570
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,291
There are still
people in our society

571
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:34,000
who can't stand
the sight of a girl taking flight.

572
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,375
That is what I am fighting against.

573
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,125
We are all equal up in the sky.

574
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,750
What are you guys doing here?
We are all dancing over there.

575
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,208
- Come on, let's go.
- Hurry up.

576
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,916
- Hey, Saachi.
- Yeah?

577
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,250
Why did Patty suddenly leave?

578
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,333
He left?

579
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,541
It's okay. At least he is
stepping out of the house again.

580
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,041
- What do you mean?
- You don't know?

581
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,625
Patty's fiancé.

582
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,208
Naina Jaisingh. Enjay.

583
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,708
She was an Air Force helicopter pilot.

584
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,500
Two years ago,
she lost her life in a mission.

585
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:52,833
Enjay?

586
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,666
She was Patty's fiancé?

587
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,041
Yes.

588
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,708
Hey, Saachi.

589
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,000
Give it here, I'll take it.

590
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,000
Take this.

591
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,708
Who is that?

592
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,541
Before we go to Jammu
for combat search and rescue practice

593
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,250
I would like to give all of you
the latest intelligence update.

594
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,083
This is Zareena Begum.

595
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,500
Our top RAW intelligence agent.

596
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:26,625
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

597
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,750
My identity is so secretive

598
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:32,541
that I can't even share it
with you Air Force officers.

599
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,666
That is why you need
to stop focusing on my identity

600
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,458
and start focusing
on my information.

601
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,916
This is the last straw,

602
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,291
Kareena on the outside
and Saif on the inside.

603
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,208
Jaish is planning something big.

604
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:44,916
200 kilos of RDX was confiscated
in the valley last night.

605
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,916
{\an8}RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS WING
INDIA

606
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:49,875
{\an8}Majeed Khan, a senior commander
operating in POK was also captured.

607
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,833
This caused many stone-pelting
incidents across the valley.

608
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,958
But our biggest concern is...

609
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:55,916
MOST WANTED TERRORIST
AZHAR AKHTAR

610
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,916
Azhar Akhtar.

611
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,250
Jaish's western asset.

612
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,958
He was operating in
Afghanistan before this

613
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,208
and he is an explosives expert.

614
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:07,416
He was spotted at
the training center in Balakot recently.

615
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,708
This is a sign that he
is heading towards India.

616
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,500
ISI is planning something major.

617
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:15,916
One more thing, they just
posted two of their F-16 squadrons

618
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,416
right in front of POK.

619
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,875
And this is Wing Commander
Imran Rasool.

620
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,458
Their top fighter pilot.

621
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,375
{\an8}He goes by the call sign Red Nose

622
00:39:25,958 --> 00:39:29,000
{\an8}and he too is currently
posted in POK.

623
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:34,041
Sir, I think we should cancel
our training in Jammu today.

624
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,000
No, Rocky sir, there are
CRPF reinforcements coming in

625
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,708
to control the stone pelting.

626
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,083
You can continue with your training.

627
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,208
I agree.

628
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:44,958
Any questions?

629
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,625
{\an8}No, thank you.

630
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:54,458
We will leave for Jammu in ten minutes
for the training session.

631
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,208
I will meet you at the base.

632
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,583
Dismissed.

633
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,041
{\an8}Sir, everyone is having lunch
at my house in Jammu today.

634
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,125
{\an8}Please do join us.

635
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:12,916
My lunch has already been
arranged at the Air Force station.

636
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:19,166
Give my regards to your dad.

637
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:21,791
{\an8}Sure, sir.

638
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,500
Look, it's our CRPF convoy.

639
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,791
Look! There is a chopper out there!

640
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:45,708
CRPF

641
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:23,166
Sukhi's coming on foot, right?

642
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,916
Enjoying the flight, boys?

643
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,166
{\an8}Traveling by train would
have been better.

644
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,333
A train can't do this.

645
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:26,875
<i>They both are falling for each other</i>

646
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,750
<i>-May they be together forever
-It's falling</i>

647
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:36,375
<i>Like a leaf floating on water
Flowing through the story</i>

648
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:39,041
<i>That felt complete before it began</i>

649
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,416
<i>For someone</i>

650
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,833
<i>Like a sea in the sky</i>

651
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:49,458
<i>Let's swim through it</i>

652
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:54,666
<i>Your words are like the open sky</i>

653
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,625
<i>Let's fly through them</i>

654
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,250
<i>You and me together are
A single soul and a single body</i>

655
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,875
<i>Why should I be the one
Who tells you</i>

656
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:09,375
<i>That all I want is you?</i>

657
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:13,750
<i>Am I losing my heart
Or giving it away?</i>

658
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:18,666
<i>I would stop it
But it refuses to obey</i>

659
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,291
<i>Am I losing my heart
Or giving it away?</i>

660
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,208
<i>I would stop it
But it refuses to obey</i>

661
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:33,083
<i>Put a label on your feelings</i>

662
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:37,791
<i>Give your idle heart something to do</i>

663
00:43:37,875 --> 00:43:40,875
<i>Or put a label on it</i>

664
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:45,875
<i>They both are falling for each other</i>

665
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:49,208
<i>May they be together forever</i>

666
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:55,541
<i>Like a leaf floating on water
Flowing through the story</i>

667
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,625
<i>That felt complete before it began</i>

668
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:04,458
<i>These days, every single moment</i>

669
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:09,041
<i>I spend thinking about you</i>

670
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:13,958
<i>When you stand so close to me</i>

671
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:19,000
<i>I forget about the rest of the world</i>

672
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,625
<i>You and me together are
A single soul and a single body</i>

673
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:28,208
<i>You and me together are
A single soul and a single body</i>

674
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,875
<i>Why should I be the one
Who tells you</i>

675
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,083
<i>That all I want is you?</i>

676
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:37,750
<i>Am I losing my heart
Or giving it away?</i>

677
00:44:38,416 --> 00:44:42,625
<i>I would stop it

678
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:47,500
<i>Put a label on your feelings</i>

679
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:52,166
<i>Give your idle heart something to do</i>

680
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,125
<i>Or put a label on it</i>

681
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:03,000
<i>Let's swim through it</i>

682
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,250
PATHANIA'S

683
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:13,500
<i>Let's fly through it</i>

684
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:23,166
<i>Let's fly through it</i>

685
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,583
What a beautiful house, Uncle!

686
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,791
Thank you!

687
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,583
Actually, Shammi's mother made this house.

688
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:43,041
Taking care of it has become
a hobby of mine.

689
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,666
And this is my wife Beena.

690
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,458
And that is Naina.

691
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,083
Our Enjay.

692
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,250
Beautiful.

693
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,416
Dad?

694
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,916
Yes, Shammi. I will be right there.

695
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,250
I will see what he wants, Uncle.

696
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,208
So...

697
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:13,583
Shammi.

698
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,458
Dad... I tell you!

699
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,083
How are you, Shammi?

700
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,166
I see...

701
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,291
Washing the dishes, Shammi?

702
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,083
- Can I help?
- No.

703
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:30,583
You are our guest.

704
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:31,791
But I want to.

705
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:32,958
No.

706
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,041
Can I?

707
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,291
No.

708
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,375
Please?

709
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,083
Please?

710
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:43,583
You can't do it. Stop trying.

711
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,250
Yes, Rocky sir. <i>Jai Hind!</i>

712
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,541
Guys! Rocky sir called.

713
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,041
Because of bad weather,
we get the day off!

714
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:51,333
So, that means we're
going to stay here tonight!

715
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:52,791
Staycation!

716
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:53,958
Yes!

717
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,166
Hello?

718
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,541
This is my house.
At least, ask me.

719
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:00,416
Yeah, yeah.
Let's start with tea.

720
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,791
- Yes! Yes...
- Tea, tea, tea.

721
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:05,250
And you get amazing
<i>kullad</i> tea here.

722
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:08,083
Shammi, go out and get it
for your friends.

723
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,125
Yes, sir. Let me get my jacket.

724
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:16,500
If Rocky sir could see him
following orders like this...

725
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,916
I am sure he would get emotional.

726
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,541
Come, let me show you Jammu.

727
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,958
Why? Was your ex from here?

728
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,458
No,

729
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,041
but my next could be.

730
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,375
By God's grace that day has arrived

731
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:47,333
{\an8}PRESENT DAY

732
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:49,166
{\an8}when I am about
to accomplish my life's purpose.

733
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,833
This is my last message to Kashmir.

734
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:53,583
{\an8}14TH FEBRUARY 2019

735
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:57,416

<i>Inshallah.</i>

It is time to fulfill your purpose

for your community, your family,
and your country.

742
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,666
May God protect you.

743
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,916
- "The fire doesn't start on time...
- Wow!

744
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:45,541
- The fire doesn't start on time.
- Wow!

745
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:47,916
- Don't burn me in my dreams."
- Amazing!

<i>- Ask him when he will come home.

749
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,375
<i>"Did you eat?"</i>

750
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:13,333
{\an8}- Sir, that red car!
- Pull up next to it!

751
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:15,541
A red Eco is overtaking
the convoy, stop it!

752
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:17,541
Come on! Drive faster!

753
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,500
Stop that Red Eco! Hurry!

754
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,333
- Say "Dad."
- Look she is saying hi to all of you.

755
00:49:24,416 --> 00:49:25,583

Hey!

757
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,500
Hey, stop the car! Stop the car!

758
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,750
Somebody please bring a stretcher!

759
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,458
Hurry, get a stretcher!

760
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:57,416
Somebody! Please!

00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:19,916

762
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:21,791
Crew room.

763
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,958
<i>By God's grace, that day has arrived</i>

764
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,541

765
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,166

{\an8}<i>Inshallah.</i>

768
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,833
Jaish has taken
responsibility for this attack.

769
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:39,458
- Cowards! I will...
- Relax, Taj.

770
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,791
Let's follow protocols.

771
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,208
{\an8}Sir, forget protocols.
They don't follow any so why should we?

772
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,541
Because that's the difference
between us and them!

773
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:49,375
And you? What is the point
of you being undercover?

774
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,958
What are you trying
to say, Squadron Leader?

775
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,500
{\an8}Settle down, Patty.
All of you settle down.

776
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,166
Zareena, please give us a rundown
of this situation.

777
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:00,500
Seventy soldiers are dead
and eighty are injured.

778
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,458
{\an8}Azhar was the mastermind of this mission.

779
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,333
{\an8}He knew that infiltrating
the Air Force base was impossible.

780
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,375
{\an8}And that is why he got
Majeed Khan captured

781
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:12,041
{\an8}which resulted in a
stone pelting across the valley.

782
00:52:12,125 --> 00:52:16,375
{\an8}To control the situation we asked
for CRPF reinforcements from Jammu.

783
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,750
{\an8}En route, he attacked the CRPF convoy.

784
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,583
{\an8}CRPF was the target all along.

785
00:52:22,916 --> 00:52:25,375
And this whole plan
was Azhar Akhtar's.

786
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,625
As of now, we have no information
on Azhar's whereabouts.

787
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,750
{\an8}Pakistan has put their Air Force
and army on high alert

788
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:34,416
{\an8}and they have increased
their air patrolling on the border.

789
00:52:34,791 --> 00:52:37,208
{\an8}Sir, they are anticipating
a commando strike like Uri.

790
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:41,166
Apart from this information, I have no
other intelligence to share as of now.

791
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:43,708
<i>Jai Hind.</i>

792
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:44,750
{\an8}<i>Jai Hind.</i>

793
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,541
We are on red alert.

794
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,583
{\an8}We will start air patrolling
on the LoC in one hour.

795
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:54,125
I want everybody focused and ready.

796
00:52:54,291 --> 00:52:55,250
{\an8}- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

797
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:57,125
Debu sir has been called to Delhi.

798
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,375
To meet the Chief
of the Western Air Command.

799
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:02,541
Patty, you will go
to Delhi with Debu sir.

800
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:04,291
Be ready to leave in one hour.

801
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,208
Minni, Sukhi, you are on standby.

802
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:08,291
With due respect, sir.

803
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,625
The Pakistan Air Force
can attack us at any time.

804
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,041
And when they do...

805
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,666
I want to be here, sir.

806
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:18,791
This is not a request, Patty.

807
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:20,500
This is an order.

808
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,791
Get ready for your first patrolling.
Dismissed.

809
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,041
{\an8}NSA HEADQUARTERS, NEW DELHI

810
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,083
{\an8}Arjun?

811
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,500
What do the latest
intelligence reports say?

812
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,750
After the setback of Uri,
Pakistan doesn't want to take any risks.

813
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:42,416
That is why Jaish has emptied
all their launch pads in POK

814
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,291
fearing a counterattack by us.

815
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,583
{\an8}Now all the terrorists
are holed up

816
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,291
{\an8}deep inside Pakistan
at the Jaish headquarters.

817
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:52,458
{\an8}Some in Peshawar, some in Balakot,
and the rest in Bahawalpur.

818
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,916
So, how do we respond to this attack?

819
00:53:58,916 --> 00:53:59,916
There is one option.

820
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:04,250
But we haven't done
anything like it since 1971.

821
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:07,916
So, you're saying...

822
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,208
that we should launch
an air strike on Pakistan?

823
00:54:11,708 --> 00:54:14,958
Not on Pakistan but on Jaish which is
operating from Pakistan's territory.

824
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:19,666
If we want to teach them a lesson
we have to speak their language.

825
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:26,333
Done. Sometimes the only way
to get justice is through...

826
00:54:26,416 --> 00:54:27,291
Revenge.

827
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:32,291
Well.

828
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:35,000
Right, gentlemen.
Ball is in your court.

829
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,708
Come back with a plan.

830
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,083
You were saying something.

831
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,541
Why don't you say it
in front of everyone?

832
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:48,083
Yes, sir.

833
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:55,166
Sir, I think we should strike
Jabba Top, the area near Balakot.

834
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,125
That is their explosives
training center

835
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:00,166
where more than 300 militants
are currently being trained.

836
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:05,458
{\an8}Most probably the explosives
used in Pulwama came from there.

837
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,583
But the main reason I feel this is

838
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:11,416
because the probability of Azhar Akhtar
being there is very high.

839
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,208
It is all our fault.

840
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,250
Train blasts,

841
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,208
{\an8}bomb blasts,

842
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:39,458
{\an8}26/11,

843
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,083
and now...

844
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,125
Pulwama.

845
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,291
We have been putting up with their
terrorism for years.

846
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:52,375
And for the past 50 years, no government

847
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:54,916
has given them a befitting reply.

848
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:56,625
But now...

849
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,416
enough.

850
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:02,416
It is time to show them
who their boss is!

851
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:07,625
We are ready, sir.

852
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,083
But bear in mind,

853
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:12,208
that there should be no
civilian casualties.

854
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:14,916
Our fight is against terror.

855
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,833
Not their people.

856
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,000
Ajit.

857
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:22,000
Yes?

858
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,083
Take me through the plan.

859
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:29,541
Permission to begin, sir?

860
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,333
OPERATION BANDAR

861
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:35,958
Sir, on 25th February you
will be on a jungle safari,

862
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,791
and on that very day, all senior
officers of the Indian Air Force

863
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,583
will be attending
Air Marshall Rawal sir's farewell party.

864
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,500
<i>Good fellow
He's a jolly good fell...</i>

865
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:47,583
<i>Rawal sir will leave that party
at exactly twelve o'clock</i>

866
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,041
<i>to head to Srinagar.</i>

867
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:52,625
<i>And once he reaches there, he will monitor
the mission from the operations room.</i>

868
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:55,958
The mission "Operation Bandar"
will be launched from Gwalior air base.

869
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:56,958
Good.

870
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,750
The enemy would not expect us
to launch an attack from so far away.

871
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:01,750
INACTIVE AIR BASES

872
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,875
All the air bases in
and around Srinagar and the LoC

873
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,666
<i>will be inactive on that night.</i>

874
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:10,333
Air Commodore
Debojyoti Biswas sir, AOC Srinagar

875
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,958
will command this operation
from our early warning aircraft.

876
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:20,083
{\an8}At 0200 hours, 12 Mirage aircraft
will take off from Gwalior air base.

877
00:57:20,541 --> 00:57:21,666
{\an8}Maintain formation.

878
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:24,541
{\an8}Exactly 30 minutes
after that, at 0230 hours

879
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:27,666
{\an8}<i>two Sukhoi fighter jets
will take off from Bareilly</i>

880
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:30,708
<i>for the protection of the
Mirages and for air defense.</i>

881
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:37,666
Target area clear of enemy.
We are entering POK.

882
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,208
We have 16 minutes.
The mission is a go.

883
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,583
Roger. Crossing LoC.

884
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,083
Switch on all radio jammers.

885
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:45,708
<i>Wilco. Radio jammers on.</i>

886
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,458
04 minutes to target. Split.

887
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:54,166
{\an8}BALAKOT, PAKISTAN 0340 HRS

888
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,083
Hit, hit, hit. Confirmed impact.

889
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,625
<i>Mike 2 you are clear.</i>

890
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,208
<i>Mike 2 coming in for a run.</i>

891
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,291
<i>Mike 3 you are clear.</i>

892
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,208
<i>Roger. Coming in.</i>

893
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,291
Target destroyed.
Heading back to base.

894
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:02,375
Patty, we will cover
the Mirages till the LoC.

895
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:04,541
Roger, Taj. This is Patty
diving in for a check.

896
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:11,000
Good job, Mike 1 and team!

897
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,250
Still no enemy in sight.

898
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,041
The air situation is still in our favor.

899
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:23,750
Incoming missile. Seven o'clock!

900
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,166
Deploying flares hang on.

901
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,541
All systems good, Patty.

902
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:30,291
Re-engaging.

903
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:51,583
The infidels have destroyed
our training center.

904
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:55,208
We have lost hundreds
of our mujahideen.

905
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,583
Their fighters will
still be in our airspace.

906
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,541
Send them to hell!

907
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:06,666
05 minutes, boys. It's getting tight.

908
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,500
{\an8}PAKISTAN AIRBASE, ISLAMABAD

909
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,916
Scramble, scramble, scramble.

910
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,791
{\an8}Vector 290. Range 100 kilometers.
Target, two bandits.

911
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:15,791
RED NOSE

912
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:18,916
I repeat, range 100 kilometers.
Target, two bandits.

913
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:23,458
Be alert! One Pak F-16
scrambled from Islamabad.

914
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:25,875
Mirage boys, drop all load
and get back immediately.

915
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:26,833
Roger.

916
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,625
PAK INDIA

917
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,458
Approaching LoC. 02 minutes.

918
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:37,083
Hurry up boys, you are in the range
of their surface-to-air missiles.

919
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,541
<i>Command, this is Mike 1.</i>

920
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,583
Four of our Mirages
have crossed the LoC.

921
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:42,208
The rest will cross in a minute.

922
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:48,541
Last four crossing LoC.
All in safe and sound.

923
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:52,500
<i>Mission accomplished.
I repeat, mission accomplished.</i>

924
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:54,166
Good job, boys.

925
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:55,875
Patty, Taj, return to base.

926
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,458
All right, heading back.
See you at the base, Taj.

927
01:00:59,833 --> 01:01:00,916
Roger. See you at the base.

928
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,875
{\an8}LOCKING

929
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,791
{\an8}Where did he come from?
Bash, can you see anything?

930
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:08,250
- Negative, Taj. I can't see anyone.
- He is tracking us. Deploying flares.

931
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:14,333
{\an8}Unni, a missile is tracking me,
can you see the enemy?

932
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:15,666
Negative, Bash. I can't see anyone.

933
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,625
UNNI

934
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,416
How far is the F-16 from Taj?

935
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:21,458
Ten kilometers and closing, sir.

936
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,458
{\an8}- Where did Patty go?
- I can't see him on the radar, sir.

937
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,875
Bloody hell! Debu, Rocky,
where is Patty?

938
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,875
<i>- Where the hell is he?</i>
- Patty, this is Command.

939
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,125
Where are you?
Where are you, Patty?

940
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,416
<i>Where are you, Patty? Damn it!</i>

941
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,916
Taj, he can lock us any second now.
He is right behind us.

942
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,458
He is closing in, the missile
warning is increasing.

943
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:51,791
Unni, radars on.

944
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,791
Roger, Patty.

945
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,666
Command, this is Patty.
Permission to engage.

946
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,833
Patty, clear to engage.

947
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,208
Get him.

948
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,791
- Track him, Unni. Come on.
- Almost there.

949
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:04,916
RED NOSE

950
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:05,916
LOCKING

951
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:09,791
Locked. Taj, extricate.

952
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,416
Get out of here I
have him locked.

953
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,583
I can't. He has me locked.

954
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,583
Fire, Patty, he can
fire at Taj at any moment.

955
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:19,041
Bloody hell, it's a two-way lock.

956
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,708
Command, switching
to emergency frequency.

957
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:25,541
This is Serra One India on guard.

958
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:28,000
- Ready to die?
- Red Nose on guard.

959
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,000
Your aircraft has trespassed into
Pakistani airspace, my friend.

960
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:35,291
Pulwama is in India where
you trespassed, my friend.

961
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:37,541
You might have heard the saying,

962
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,666
"All is fair in love and war."

963
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:44,125
But in my India, we don't
betray in either love or war.

964
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:47,541
I can't fall in love with you.

965
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:49,875
So I will settle for war.

966
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,208
You want an eye for an eye?

967
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,208
No.

968
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:56,750
I want revenge for a betrayal.

969
01:02:57,916 --> 01:03:00,625
Then keep a Param Vir Chakra
ready for your fighters.

970
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:02,958
Don't you go to school?

971
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,625
Param Vir Chakra is not
just awarded to martyrs,

972
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,208
it is also awarded to bravehearts.

973
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:09,666
And they will surely get one.

974
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,333
But you are the one
who is going to die today.

975
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,666
You have five seconds my friend.

976
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,083
Just five seconds.

977
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:20,458
Think about it.

978
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:23,833
Do you want to die reciting poetry or

979
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:26,166
do you want to go home peacefully?

980
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:30,541
Five.

981
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:32,791
Four.

982
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,333
Three.

983
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:37,416
{\an8}Two.

984
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,416
{\an8}The lock is off, Patty.

985
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,250
He has disengaged. I am out of here.

986
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,500
Patty, disengage your
missile and fly back.

987
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:50,333
You are lucky that our
fight is against terrorism

988
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,166
and not against your country.

989
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,708
Your cunningness might
have won this battle for you,

990
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,250
but the war is due, my friend.

991
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,541
We will meet again soon

992
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:06,708
and on that day there
won't be a countdown.

993
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:08,791
I will eagerly wait for that day.

994
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,500
Yes!

995
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,791
{\an8}Operation Bandar is a success.

996
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,916
{\an8}ISI HEADQUARTERS, PAKISTAN

997
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,500
Shame on us!

998
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:35,333
They have been planning this
for so long and we had no clue.

999
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,833
Jaish is better than us.

1000
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,250
At least they can execute
their missions, unlike us.

1001
01:04:39,958 --> 01:04:43,708
In a way, we should be
thankful to the Indians...

1002
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,708
for targeting the Jaish camp.

1003
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:50,875
If they had attacked our military base
then all of us would be dead by now.

1004
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,416
Have you lost your mind?

1005
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:54,375
You are being thankful
to them for the attack?

1006
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,416
No, sir, all I am trying to
say is that the Indians knew

1007
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:03,416
that we had given Jaish's mujahideens
permission to operate on our land.

1008
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,666
This attack is just a warning.

1009
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,166
That the Indians can...

1010
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,500
Attack us in our own territory
whenever they want.

1011
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:12,708
Is that what you will tell
the people of this nation?

1012
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:16,750
{\an8}No, sir. I was just trying to say that

1013
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:20,166
{\an8}maybe it is time for us to stop
harboring Jaish's mujahideens on our land.

1014
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,458
Please continue your conversation.

1015
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
I was just saying...

1016
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,333
That you no longer
need the mujahideen.

1017
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,125
You're right.

1018
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:38,666
But how can you achieve bigger goals
when your thinking is so small?

1019
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,958
We carried out a suicide attack while
they replied with an air strike.

1020
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,291
We dug more than 300 graves today.

1021
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:53,000
But now it is time for
the Pakistani forces to think bigger.

1022
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:55,958
Because now...

1023
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,625
we will not forget the graves...

1024
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,333
nor the funerals...

1025
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,916
nor will we forget to take revenge.

1026
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:07,500
There won't be any
more terror attacks.

1027
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:10,416
There will be war.

1028
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:33,125
<i>We have the right to do
Something crazy tonight</i>

1029
01:06:33,416 --> 01:06:35,166
<i>-No matter what
-No matter what...</i>

1030
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,708
<i>The world says</i>

1031
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:48,500
<i>-We are spoiled brats
-Spoiled...</i>

1032
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:52,208
<i>-We will break all the rules tonight
-We will break...</i>

1033
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:55,958
<i>We haven't been sober all evening</i>

1034

<i>Take a look, we are out of our minds</i>

1036
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:08,291
<i>No one is going home tonight</i>

1037
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:12,125
<i>Everyone who sees us can testify</i>

1038
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:14,916
<i>The lions are on the prowl tonight</i>

1039
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:18,375
<i>No one is going home tonight</i>

<i>Singing at the top of our lungs</i>

1042
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,708
<i>Everyone who sees us can testify</i>

1043
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,416
<i>The lions are on the prowl tonight</i>

1044
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:43,958
<i>I am going to do
Something stupid tonight</i>

1045
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:49,000
<i>Please make sure
I don't upset anyone</i>

1046
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:59,541
<i>I am being naughty tonight</i>

1047
01:07:59,791 --> 01:08:03,958
<i>My heart is all over the place</i>

1048
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:08,000
<i>We haven't been sober all evening</i>

1049
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:12,541
<i>Meet me tomorrow
If you need something</i>

1050
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:15,375
<i>Take a look</i>

1051
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,000
<i>We are out of our minds</i>

1052
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:26,833
<i>No one is going home tonight</i>

1053
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:32,250

1062
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:27,791
{\an8}Bye, Minni.

1063
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,958
"Sometimes the journey
is so beautiful...

1064
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:41,166
that you never want
to reach your destination."

1065
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:44,583
Nice.

1066
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:46,583
{\an8}Did you just come up with that?

1067
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:50,208
No.

1068
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:51,916
I read it on the back of a truck.

1069
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,666
Will you just keep thinking
or finally ask me?

1070
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:03,583
What?

1071
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,000
Why didn't I drop her to her door?

1072
01:10:09,666 --> 01:10:11,458
Maybe she would have
invited me in for a coffee.

1073
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:15,541
Come on, Patty,
do I need to do everything?

PAK INDIA

{\an8}Four F-16s are heading from
Pakistan to Srinagar.

1076
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,541
{\an8}Scramble, scramble, scramble.

1077
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,708
<i>Initial vector 200.</i>

<i>Scramble. Scramble. Scramble.</i>

1081
01:11:07,333 --> 01:11:09,083
<i>Scramble. Scramble. Scramble.</i>

1082
01:11:22,333 --> 01:11:23,625
Tanya, put them on the big screen.

1083
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,750
- Sir.
- That's more than four.

1084
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,208
Scramble 12 Sukhois
from the Udhampur base.

1085
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:30,458
Incoming aerial threat.
16 Pak fighters.

1086
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,500
Rocky and the team, head toward Rajouri.

1087
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:33,958
They are heading
for the ammunition dump.

1088
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:36,250
12 Sukhois will be joining
you from the Udhampur base.

1089
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,000

Approaching target.

1094
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:51,958
Roger. Fire!

1095
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:55,166
Stay alert, boys!
Incoming missiles!

1096
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:59,458
<i>Flares, flares, flares!
Come on! Flares! Banking left.</i>

1097
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,541
- 30 degrees right!
- Fire!

1098
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,916
The Indian Fighters are
right behind us.

TAJ

1100
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,458
Command! We have eyes on the enemy.

1101
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:21,583
We have deceived the Indians!
Phase one is successful boys!

1102
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,458
Drop your bombs and get out of here.

1103
01:12:31,416 --> 01:12:33,833
Command, something is wrong.
The Pak Fighters are turning back.

1104
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,541
It is time for phase two.

1105
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:40,833
Sir, two more F-16s from Pakistan
are heading for Batalik.

1106
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,625
Looks like Batalik could
be their next target.

1107
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,458
That's right.
Rocky, send two aircraft toward Batalik.

1108
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,583
The rest of you continue the pursuit.

1109
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:49,458
Roger. Taj and Patty,
head towards Batalik.

1110
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:50,750
Roger.

1111
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:54,666
The Pak fighters
are about to cross the LoC.

1112
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:57,250
Command, give us permission
to cross the LoC.

1113
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:58,291
{\an8}Permission denied.

1114
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,208
{\an8}Nobody crosses the LoC.

1115
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,375
Fall back. I repeat, fall back.

1116
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:03,666
Roger. Falling back.

1117
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,041
{\an8}BATALIK KARGIL SECTOR

1118
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:14,583
Fire!

1119
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:31,208
Patty, it's Red Nose!

1120
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,791
I won't spare him today.

1121
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:47,458
Patty and Taj, you are heading
towards the LoC. Fall back.

1122
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,083
Nobody will cross the LoC.

1123
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:50,041
I repeat.

1124
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,208
Do not cross the LoC.

1125
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:55,083
Sir, Pakistan has
jammed all the radios.

1126
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,541
Patty, they have split up.
They're heading for the LoC.

1127
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:03,791
We should head back to base.

1128
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,708
I will get them before
they reach the LoC.

1129
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:07,333
You can go back if you want to.

1130
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,291
Damn it, Patty! Let's go, come on!

1131
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:10,625
I am going after the left.

1132
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,166
I will take the other one.

1133
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,333
Engaging missile,
I am taking a shot.

1134
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:28,166
- Shit, I missed.
- Patty, we are about to cross the LoC.

1135
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,791
Command, permission to cross the LoC.

1136
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,083
Patty, I think they have
jammed our radios.

1137
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:34,166
Bloody hell! They have crossed the LoC.

1138
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:36,291
Damn it, Patty.
Damn it, Taj.

1139
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:41,583
Two F-16s, Taj! It's an ambush!
Get out of there!

1140
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,541
Get out of there now. Taj, come in.

1141
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:46,000
- The radio is back.
<i>- Bash, it's an ambush!</i>

1142
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,833
<i>You have crossed the LoC.</i>

1143
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:49,750
Two bogeys behind us, Taj.

1144
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:52,875
It's a trap! It's not just two,
there are four F-16s.

1145
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,458
Nine o'clock and three o'clock!

1146
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,666
They have trapped us.
There are too many of them, Patty.

1147
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:13,750
As-Salaam-Alaikum,
Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania.

1148
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:15,583
<i>Welcome to Pakistan.</i>

1149
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:19,000
Today, it's our turn
to teach you a lesson.

1150
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,166
You won the last round

1151
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:27,708
and it looks like luck is
on your side even today.

1152
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,458
This trap was set
up for you Pathania sahib.

1153
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:34,750
But I am afraid that
the price of your actions

1154
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:37,458
in Balakot that day will
be paid by your friends.

1155
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:38,875
How far is Taj from us, Unni?

1156
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,958
30 kilometers, Patty.
Vector three zero.

1157
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,125
I am coming, Taj. I am on my way.

1158
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:51,000
No, Patty, don't come here.
There are too many of them.

1159
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:58,666
Today your friends will meet
the same fate as Naina Jaisingh.

1160
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,166
<i>Call sign Enjay.</i>

1161
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,625
I am sure you remember the name.

1162
01:16:03,541 --> 01:16:04,416
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1163
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,916
You are not the only ones
who get intelligence reports.

1164
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,125
We also keep tabs on you.

1165
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:16,375
You will soon be mourning the loss
of your friends, Shamsher Pathania.

1166
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:18,041
Once again.

1167
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:20,833
Come.

1168
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,750
If you think you
can save them, then come.

1169
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,833
Incoming missile! Defending!

1170
01:16:33,916 --> 01:16:35,541
Flares! Taj, flares!

1171
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,416
Roger. Deploying flares.

1172
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,583
Taj, flares!

1173
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:53,333
- Oh, shit.
- We're hit. We're hit.

1174
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,041
Shit! I am on my way, Taj.

1175
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,750
Just hold on.

1176
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:02,958
We are going down!

1177
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:04,875
- Mayday, mayday, mayday.
- Taj!

1178
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,458
- We're going down.
- Bash!

1179
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:08,833
I am on my way, Bash!

1180
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:19,125
No! No!

1181
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,458
Command, Taj and Bash are hit.
Both have fallen in Pakistan.

1182
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:28,541
Patty, Unni, back to the base.
You are in POK.

1183
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:31,208
Send the rescue choppers.
I have my eyes on their fighters.

1184
01:17:31,541 --> 01:17:33,708
- I am going after them.
- Permission denied!

1185
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,750
I don't want any more casualties.

1186
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:37,708
Return to the base. Now!

1187
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,875
We didn't just lose our
soldiers in Batalik today...

1188
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,958
but we also lost two fighter pilots
on the other side of the LoC.

1189
01:18:03,375 --> 01:18:04,916
Who authorized you, Patty?

1190
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:09,250
Who authorized you to cross the LoC?

1191
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:11,125
I asked for permission, sir.

1192
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:13,958
But the radios were jammed.

1193
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:17,583
We were in the middle
of the chase. I almost...

1194
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:18,625
Chasing what?

1195
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,250
Individual glory?!

1196
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:25,000
This is exactly what I was afraid of,

1197
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:27,625
that the nation would pay
for your careless actions.

1198
01:18:28,875 --> 01:18:31,333
Two of our aviators
are currently missing!

1199
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:34,166
All because of you!

1200
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:39,458
This force pays the price
for your ego every single time.

1201
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:43,625
But this time...

1202
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,333
you will also have to face
the consequences.

1203
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:51,750
I am ordering a court of inquiry...

1204
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:55,291
for your conduct in the air.

1205
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:04,000
Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania
and Squadron Leader Rajan Unnithan.

1206
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,833
You both are grounded
till further orders.

1207
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:08,291
Dismissed.

1208
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:34,791
- I'm going down. I'm hit! Patty, I'm hit!
- Mayday!

1209
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,208
- We're going down! We're hit!
- I'm going down! I'm hit!

1210
01:19:37,291 --> 01:19:41,083
- Going down! We're hit!
- We are going down!

1211
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,541
The diplomatic channels
are doing their jobs.

1212
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,708
Basheer will be home soon.

1213
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:00,291
My Basheer is a lion.

1214
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:03,541
And even in a cage,
a lion remains a lion.

1215
01:20:04,541 --> 01:20:07,458
Pakistanis cannot hurt my Basheer.

1216
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,458
Just wait and watch.

1217
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:51,958
After going through the cockpit
recordings, surveillance unit records,

1218
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:56,750
and crash site location data
we have concluded

1219
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:00,125
that Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania
and Squadron Leader Sartaj Gill

1220
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:03,625
crossed the LoC while
pursuing their targets.

1221
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,791
Unfortunately,
Squadron Leader Sartaj Gill

1222
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:08,916
was ambushed on
the other side of the LoC.

1223
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:15,208
{\an8}Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania cannot
be held responsible for this incident.

1224
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,666
However,

1225
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:23,541
there will be some changes
in the Air Dragons unit.

1226
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,708
Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania

1227
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,333
will no longer be a part
of the Air Dragons unit.

1228
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:32,750
He has been posted to the
Air Force Academy in Hyderabad

1229
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:35,666
as a flying instructor.

1230
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:42,708
A new Sukhoi pilot
will replace him in the next 48 hours.

1231
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,708
This inquiry now stands closed.

1232
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:48,375
Good day, gentlemen.

1233
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:04,416
Sir, may I?

1234
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:06,250
Yes.

1235
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,166
Sir, the decision you made today...

1236
01:22:15,625 --> 01:22:17,666
We are not happy with it.

1237
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,250
For your own good...

1238
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:22,416
I don't mind seeing you
all upset for a few days.

1239
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:28,083
- Sir, but Patty...
- Minni, this is not the first time...

1240
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:31,416
that this force has lost
fighters because of him.

1241
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:36,875
After a raid operation

1242
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,416
in Naushera three years ago,

1243
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:43,041
our Garud commandos
required evacuation.

1244
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:46,958
<i>The enemy was
using artillery guns</i>

1245
01:22:47,166 --> 01:22:50,166
<i>- to fire at the position of our commandos.</i>
- Fire!

1246
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:56,583
Our choppers were ready
to evacuate the Garud commandos

1247
01:22:57,958 --> 01:23:00,083
and Patty's Sukhoi was protecting them.

1248
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,791
<i>Because of the heavy shelling,</i>

1249
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:06,291
<i>our choppers were unable to reach
the pick-up point of the commandos.</i>

1250
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:09,291
But we had a brave helicopter pilot.

1251
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:12,791
<i>Squadron Leader Naina Jaisingh. Enjay.</i>

1252
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,875
Charlie one. I am coming to get you.

1253
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:19,750
No, ma'am!
Stay back it's too dangerous!

1254
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:23,833
<i>Because of the heavy fog, we couldn't
pinpoint the exact location of the guns.</i>

1255
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,666
Do you have the exact location, Enjay?

1256
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:28,833
Negative, Patty. I can't see the exact
location because of low visibility.

1257
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:30,041
I am moving closer.

1258
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:32,416
Roger. But not too close.
It's dangerous.

1259
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,000
Chill, Patty. It's not easy
to catch me in the air.

1260
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,500
I know you can do it, Enjay.

1261
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:37,583
I am right behind you.

1262
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:38,833
Let's get them.

1263
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,625
Patty let Enjay go close
to the position of the guns.

1264
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:45,583
Patty, there are six artillery guns
firing non-stop.

1265
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:47,666
- Co-ordinates, Enjay?
- Right in front of me.

1266
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,125
Aim at my chopper.
I will move on your command.

1267
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:52,708
Roger. On my count of three.
Turn a hard left.

1268
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:56,666
- Roger, Patty.
- Three.

1269
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:58,291
Two.

1270
01:23:58,875 --> 01:23:59,958
One. Move!

1271
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:03,833
Fire!

1272
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:06,958
<i>Patty's missile might have reached
the position of the guns</i>

1273
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,041
<i>but the enemy's artillery firing...</i>

1274
01:24:12,125 --> 01:24:13,625
- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! I am hit!
- Shit!

1275
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:15,125
I am going down! I am hit!

1276
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:16,833
- Patty, I am hit! I am going down!
- No!

1277
01:24:16,916 --> 01:24:20,541
I am going down. I am hit!
Patty, I am going down! I am going down...

1278
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,416
No, Enjay! No!

1279
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:29,916
Patty knew exactly
how dangerous it was.

1280
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:33,416
If he had stopped Enjay that day

1281
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,041
then she would have still been alive.

1282
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,458
Neither the Air Force would
have lost a capable pilot

1283
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:44,125
nor would a brother
have lost his sister.

1284
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:48,208
Yes, Minni.

1285
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:53,541
Naina Jaisingh was my younger sister.

1286
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:02,041
I am sorry, sir.

1287
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:06,375
But if Enjay wasn't your sister...

1288
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,541
would you still blame Patty?

1289
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,208
Yes.

1290
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:15,416
I blamed him then

1291
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:17,708
and I blame him now.

1292
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,375
Patty is our best pilot.

1293
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:24,791
But there are disadvantages
to being the best.

1294
01:25:26,125 --> 01:25:27,916
They can't see the
limitations of others

1295
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,291
and push them
way past their limits.

1296
01:25:33,541 --> 01:25:35,375
The price of Patty's attitude

1297
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:38,291
was paid by Enjay back then...

1298
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:42,416
and now Taj
and Bash are paying for it.

1299
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,583
And trust me, if I hadn't
separated him from the rest of you

1300
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:50,291
you would be next.

1301
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,916
{\an8}SQN LDR SHAMSHER PATHANIA

1302
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:07,291
So, you're leaving?

1303
01:26:08,625 --> 01:26:09,500
Yep.

1304
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:15,000
Without fighting for your right?

1305
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:17,250
I am a fighter.

1306
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:18,375
I fight wars.

1307
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,416
Not petty arguments.

1308
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,416
I know what Rocky sir thinks.

1309
01:26:22,708 --> 01:26:24,166
Rocky sir is right, Minni.

1310
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:26,875
It's better for everyone if I stay
away from operational flying.

1311
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,333
And from me, as well!

1312
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:32,250
What do you want to hear, Minni?

1313
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,916
What you want
to say but refuse to say it.

1314
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,875
I am not good for you Minni,
it's as simple as that.

1315
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,500
And I can't decide that for myself?

1316
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:52,333
You saved me, Minni.

1317
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,125
You really saved me.

1318
01:26:56,333 --> 01:27:00,125
I did not think I could
ever be happy again...

1319
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,291
But you became my reason to smile.

1320
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:09,708
Sometimes...

1321
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:13,041
I even dared to see
a future with you.

1322
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:18,291
But...

1323
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,291
I got in our way.

1324
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:26,083
I am broken, Minni.

1325
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,250
I hurt the people who love me.

1326
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:35,500
I cannot make anyone happy.

1327
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:39,708
So you decided to make me cry
so that I can be happy?

1328
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,666
Don't punish yourself like this, please.

1329
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,083
Then who should I punish, Minni?

1330
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,333
Who should I punish?

1331
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:51,875
This is all my fault.

1332
01:27:53,875 --> 01:27:55,000
I caused this.

1333
01:27:57,291 --> 01:28:00,875
You don't have enough
power to do all of this.

1334
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:04,666
You are not that important.

1335
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:10,916
Get over me, Minni.

1336
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:14,791
Focus on your work.

1337
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:17,916
This is pointless.

1338
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,000
I am no good for anyone.

1339
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,583
Okay.

1340
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:27,791
Maybe, you are right.

1341
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:33,625
All the best,
Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania.

1342
01:28:44,875 --> 01:28:47,416
{\an8}AIR FORCE ACADEMY, HYDERABAD

1343
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:51,041
{\an8}Flight! Eyes right!

1344
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:52,666
<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir!

1345
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:56,125
Welcome to Air Force Academy, Patty.

1346
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,208
Your reputation precedes you.

1347
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,250
Thank you, sir.

1348
01:29:01,375 --> 01:29:02,916
Well done on the Balakot strike.

1349
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:04,583
The entire nation is proud of you.

1350
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:06,041
We are very proud.

1351
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:09,125
And don't bloody worry.

1352
01:29:09,583 --> 01:29:12,333
{\an8}Wherever our pilots might be,
they are fine.

1353
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:17,500
Yes, sir.

1354
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:20,958
Take over Brar Squadron
as their flying instructor.

1355
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,791
These days a lot of cadets
are on their first solo stage.

1356
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:26,375
You will get all the details.

1357
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:33,166
NIRMAL JIT SINGH SEKHON BLOCK

1358
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:45,500
- Excuse me.
- Sir.

1359
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,541
- What is going on?
- Sir, there is a flight cadet...

1360
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:49,708
It's her first solo
and she has panicked mid-air.

1361
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:50,875
Okay if I come?

1362
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,625
Sure, sir. Come on.

1363
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,625
Thanks.

1364
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,791
Neha, your speed is too high,
your heading is wrong,

1365
01:29:56,875 --> 01:29:58,208
maintain zero-niner-zero.

1366
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:06,333
- What is her situation?
- She is on finals, sir.

1367
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:22,166
Her first solo in such
strong crosswinds?

1368
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:23,708
The weather suddenly changed, sir.

1369
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:26,083
She is unable to handle it.
What is her name?

1370
01:30:26,291 --> 01:30:27,541
Flight cadet Neha Joshi, sir.

1371
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,000
- Call sign?
- NJ.

1372
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,458
Neha Joshi. NJ.

1373
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:37,750
Walkie.

1374
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:47,125
{\an8}Hi, NJ, this is
Squadron Leader Pathania.

1375
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,250
{\an8}I am here to guide you home.
How do you read me?

1376
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:50,666
{\an8}Strength five, sir.

1377
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:52,833
You are absolutely fine, NJ.
Check heading.

1378
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:55,958
{\an8}Check heading zero-niner-zero.

1379
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:59,041
{\an8}Yes, sir, it's zero-niner-zero.

1380
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:01,000
Do you see the center line
on the runway, NJ?

1381
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:05,041
{\an8}Yes, sir. I see it.

1382
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:06,875
Align the nose of the aircraft
with the center line.

1383
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:10,875
{\an8}Can you see me, NJ?

1384
01:31:11,291 --> 01:31:12,875
No, sir. I can't see you.

1385
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:19,083
It's a black car on the runway.
Can you see me now?

1386
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:22,375
- Yes, sir. I can see you.
- Okay, good.

1387
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:25,291
Turn the nose of the aircraft in
the direction of the wind, NJ.

1388
01:31:25,416 --> 01:31:26,291
Roger.

1389
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,708
<i>A little more, NJ.</i>

1390
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:31,958
NJ, reduce your speed a
bit, you're too fast.

1391
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:36,166
Speed reduced.

1392
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,208
That's good.

1393
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:39,291
You're almost home, NJ.
Hold that position.

1394
01:31:41,708 --> 01:31:43,500
Almost there, hold that position.

1395
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:46,166
Hold.

1396
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:48,625
And now! Left rudder!

1397
01:32:12,458 --> 01:32:13,333
It's an honor, sir.

1398
01:32:34,291 --> 01:32:35,333
BRIEFING

1399
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:45,708
<i>Why have You taken away my light?</i>

1400
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:50,000

01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:52,708
<i>All the reasons for my pain</i>

1402

GRADUATION
204TH COURSE

1444
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:14,958
The ATC was continuously asking Sunil,
"What's your height and position?"

1445
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,875
And this idiot replied,

1446
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:20,375
"Sir, my height is 5' 10
and I am sitting in the front seat."

1447
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:25,708
Don't even get me started about Neha!

1448
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:30,458
The ATC told her to land the other
day but she just couldn't do it.

1449
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:33,125
Sir!

1450
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:36,166
{\an8}Neha pulled off her first
solo landing quite well.

1451
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:39,250
- I was there.
- Because you guided her, sir.

1452
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:43,916
{\an8}If the girls here found out that you
instruct during emergencies

1453
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:47,083
then all of them will come up with
new landing issues every day.

1454
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,625
{\an8}Shut up, Sunil. Sir, please ignore him.

1455
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,041
Thank you for coming, sir.

1456
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:54,750
I like it.

1457
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:58,833
Looking at all of you here reminds
me of my time in the academy.

1458
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,583
The bond forged between
course-mates here...

1459
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:08,291
{\an8}this is for life.

1460
01:37:41,791 --> 01:37:42,666
- Cheers.
- Cheers, sir.

1461
01:37:42,750 --> 01:37:43,666
- Take care.
- Yeah.

1462
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:47,500
<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.

1463
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:48,958
Patty?

1464
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:49,958
Where is your drink?

1465
01:37:51,208 --> 01:37:52,083
Permission to speak, sir?

1466
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:53,500
Go ahead.

1467
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:56,500
Sir, I am putting in my papers.

1468
01:37:58,166 --> 01:38:00,625
I have decided to quit the force.

1469
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:01,916
Why?

1470
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:04,125
Sir, I...

1471
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:08,791
{\an8}Patty, you haven't taken
any leave after Balakot.

1472
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:09,916
Take a break.

1473
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,500
{\an8}We will talk when you come back.

1474
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:12,958
Come on.

1475
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:15,875
I won't change my mind, sir.

1476
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:19,833
<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.

1477
01:38:24,708 --> 01:38:27,708
{\an8}HYDERABAD

1478
01:38:32,083 --> 01:38:33,833
- Hi. KI793?
- Hello.

1479
01:38:35,458 --> 01:38:38,916
Sorry, sir. Your flight has been
canceled and rescheduled for tomorrow.

1480
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,333
Aren't there any other
flights to Jammu?

1481
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:46,708
I am an officer in the Air Force.

1482
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,416
{\an8}Sorry, sir.
The other two flights are full.

1483
01:38:59,666 --> 01:39:01,208
It's very important
that I go, ma'am.

1484
01:39:01,875 --> 01:39:02,750
Any flight will do.

1485
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,083
Please?

1486
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:12,083
Sir, you can speak
to our Operations Manager.

1487
01:39:12,166 --> 01:39:13,416
I am sure he will
be able to help you.

1488
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:15,750
- He is right there.
- Thank you.

1489
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:19,958
May I come in, sir?

1490
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:24,083
I am going by cab
you bring the car.

1491
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,958
Hello, sir.
I am Squadron Leader Pathania.

1492
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:29,083
Indian Air Force.

1493
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,875
My flight was canceled, sir.

1494
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,125
I need to reach Jammu.

1495
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:36,541
If I could get a seat
on the next flight...

1496
01:39:39,166 --> 01:39:40,041
Only if possible.

1497
01:39:41,125 --> 01:39:42,083
Air Force...

1498
01:39:43,458 --> 01:39:44,333
Yeah.

1499
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:52,916
{\an8}ABHIJEET RATHORE
MANAGER OPERATIONS

1500
01:39:53,583 --> 01:39:55,166
- That's Minal Rathore.
- Minni.

1501
01:39:57,708 --> 01:39:58,666
Your dad was in the Air Force?

1502
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:02,125
No, Air Bharat. Ground Operations.

1503
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:07,291
My dad considered me a martyr the day
he signed my Air Force consent form.

1504
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:11,958
Sir, by any chance, is your
daughter in the Air Force?

1505
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,083
No.

1506
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:16,500
Do you want something, Usha?

1507
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,541
Do you not have a daughter?
Or is she not in the Air Force?

1508
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:21,791
What do you mean?

1509
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:24,541
I was part of a special
Air Force unit in Srinagar, sir.

1510
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:27,791
Minal Rathore was a part of my team.

1511
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,458
I thought that...

1512
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:33,083
she might be your daughter.

1513
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:37,166
If I had a daughter then she
wouldn't have been in the Air Force.

1514
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:41,166
That's so sad, sir.

1515
01:40:43,833 --> 01:40:45,333
I wish she was your daughter, sir.

1516
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:49,375
Because her parents
don't accept her anyway.

1517
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,375
She is on a special posting in Srinagar.

1518
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,125
She is one of the top pilots
in our country.

1519
01:41:00,541 --> 01:41:03,166
Her parents wanted her
to get married and settle down but

1520
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:07,625
this fool risks her life
every single day so that

1521
01:41:08,583 --> 01:41:10,750
people like you
can sleep peacefully.

1522
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:19,666
Every Indian is proud of Minal
even if her dad isn't.

1523
01:41:21,416 --> 01:41:24,791
People say that the armed forces
is not a place for women.

1524
01:41:26,041 --> 01:41:27,208
I wonder why they say that, sir.

1525
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:30,166
The enemy's bullets don't
discriminate based on gender.

1526
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:34,041
We do.

1527
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:41,333
Her dad wanted
her to get married.

1528
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:42,875
So she did get married.

1529
01:41:45,416 --> 01:41:46,333
She got married to her country.

1530
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:53,000
And this fool will be true to this
relationship till her final breath.

1531
01:41:57,166 --> 01:42:01,000
It's a good thing that all the girls
in India are not like Minal.

1532
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:03,833
Otherwise, we men would
have to sit at home.

1533
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:18,083
Hand this in at the check-in counter

1534
01:42:18,666 --> 01:42:19,750
and you will get your boarding pass.

1535
01:42:22,958 --> 01:42:26,791
Next time, I think you should take
the credit for being her parents.

1536
01:42:28,708 --> 01:42:30,291
Because her parents
have lost that privilege.

1537
01:42:32,916 --> 01:42:33,791
Thank you, sir.

1538
01:42:39,916 --> 01:42:40,791
She is fine.

1539
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:44,125
She misses both of you.

1540
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:48,916
Always stay happy, Son.

1541
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,250
God bless you.

1542
01:43:12,291 --> 01:43:13,166

1545

Hey, man, I bet he has

1577
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:04,916
Explain it to him.

1578
01:45:05,708 --> 01:45:07,958
"There is no greater religion

1579
01:45:09,166 --> 01:45:10,333

your nation."

1580

both your nation

1582
01:45:17,916 --> 01:45:19,125
and your religion.

1583
01:45:19,833 --> 01:45:24,000
That reminds me of a poem
my friend once told me.

1584
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:25,916
Let him hear it.

1585
01:45:27,416 --> 01:45:28,416
We have the opportunity,

1586
01:45:29,041 --> 01:45:29,916

1587
01:45:31,375 --> 01:45:32,416
and the enemy.

1588
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,250
Listen, you rascal.

1589
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:39,875
"You will find many
lovers in this world

1590
01:45:41,333 --> 01:45:43,791
but no lover can compete with
the love you have for your country.

1591

Many die in a coffin wrapped in diamonds,
and many die wrapped in gold,

1592

coffin more beautiful

1593

Good to see you again, Patty sir.

1618
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:41,958
Sir, I always tell Unni

1619
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:45,166
{\an8}that I couldn't have cleared
TACDE without Patty sir.

1620

Where is Taj, Sukhi?

1630
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:36,833
They didn't send him back.

1631
01:49:37,541 --> 01:49:38,666
They said they don't
have orders for it.

1632
01:49:39,916 --> 01:49:44,333
They have tortured Bash, Patty.

1633
01:49:46,125 --> 01:49:48,875
They killed him mercilessly
after a lot of torture.

1634
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,500
They are bloody animals!

1635
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:15,791
His body was in pieces.

1636
01:50:17,541 --> 01:50:18,666
In bloody pieces.

1637
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:22,333
Is this their diplomacy?

1638
01:50:23,875 --> 01:50:24,916
Are these their ethics?

1639
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,958
{\an8}They say he was already
badly wounded, bloody liars!

1640
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,208
{\an8}I have seen his wounds, sir.

1641
01:50:34,166 --> 01:50:35,333
{\an8}He was murdered by them.

1642
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:38,250
Tortured and then murdered!

1643
01:50:39,541 --> 01:50:40,791
How much longer can we bear this, sir?

1644
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,541
{\an8}Let's hunt them down

1645
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:45,166
{\an8}and blow them to pieces.

1646
01:50:45,458 --> 01:50:49,125
{\an8}Calm down, Rocky. We are angry
and that is what they want.

1647
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:51,458
- Yes, sir. But...
- First, we need an update on Taj.

1648

01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:53,208
You thought he was a RAW agent?

1715
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:56,333
He is ISI's top agent
operating in India.

1716
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,791
Rocky, tell me the plan
for Taj's rescue mission,

1717
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,791
we need to get him
back no matter what.

1718
01:58:06,375 --> 01:58:11,375
According to Zareena Begum, Taj is
being held here at this military camp.

1719
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,208
He has been tortured
but he is still alive.

1720
01:58:13,541 --> 01:58:16,000
We will drop the Garuds
here and our choppers...

1721
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:17,000
<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.

1722
01:58:17,875 --> 01:58:19,333
- Sir.
- Yes, Tanya?

1723
01:58:19,666 --> 01:58:23,208
There is an update that Pakistan
has shut down its airspace.

1724
01:58:23,458 --> 01:58:24,666
{\an8}Even for domestic flights.

1725
01:58:24,875 --> 01:58:28,000
{\an8}No aircraft is allowed
to fly over their territory.

1726
01:58:28,291 --> 01:58:30,541
{\an8}Along with that, they have
activated two fighter squadrons

1727
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:33,916
{\an8}and four surface-to-air
missile squadrons at the LoC.

1728
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,166
{\an8}They have closed off all other
modes of entry, sir.

1729
01:58:36,583 --> 01:58:38,875
{\an8}Pakistan is now a no-fly zone.

1730
01:58:39,375 --> 01:58:41,291
Getting into Pakistan
is now impossible, sir.

1731
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:43,625
{\an8}You may leave now.

1732
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:44,958
{\an8}<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.

1733
01:58:48,041 --> 01:58:49,208
{\an8}This is bad news.

1734
01:58:50,541 --> 01:58:51,791
We will need to come
up with something else.

1735
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:03,916
{\an8}Permission to speak, sir?

1736
01:59:04,208 --> 01:59:05,083
{\an8}Permission denied.

1737
01:59:05,625 --> 01:59:08,000
{\an8}Sir, I just want to know what
we are doing to bring Taj back.

1738
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:09,083
We?

1739
01:59:09,708 --> 01:59:11,583
This is an internal matter
concerning me and my team, Patty.

1740
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:13,208
It is none of your business now.

1741
01:59:13,666 --> 01:59:14,583
The hell it is, sir!

1742
01:59:14,833 --> 01:59:17,666
I think you are forgetting that you
are no longer a part of this team.

1743
01:59:17,916 --> 01:59:18,958
{\an8}But I am a part of the Air Force, sir.

1744
01:59:25,291 --> 01:59:26,166
For how long?

1745
01:59:27,958 --> 01:59:29,875
You have already decided to resign.

1746
01:59:31,916 --> 01:59:32,833
Am I wrong?

1747
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,625
You were a fighter,

1748
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,666
or were you just pretending?

1749
01:59:49,833 --> 01:59:50,916
General sahib!

1750
01:59:51,125 --> 01:59:53,000
You know India
will seek revenge, right?

1751
01:59:53,208 --> 01:59:55,791
You killed one and imprisoned the other.

1752
01:59:57,500 --> 01:59:58,541
They will come for us.

1753
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:00,916
That is exactly what I want.

1754
02:00:03,208 --> 02:00:06,125
That is why I sent that infidel
back in a body bag.

1755
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:12,166
My agent has
informed me of how...

1756
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:15,000
and when they
will be attacking us.

1757
02:00:16,958 --> 02:00:18,000
We are ready.

1758
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:20,625
You should be too.

1759
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:27,333
We are leaving at 04:00 a.m. Just ensure
that all the systems are in place.

1760
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:29,916
Check Dhruv one and three.
And check the winching equipment.

1761
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:30,958
Roger that.

1762
02:00:33,041 --> 02:00:34,041
<i>Jai Hind.</i>

1763
02:00:40,916 --> 02:00:42,291
{\an8}We will bring Taj back.

1764
02:00:44,166 --> 02:00:45,041
{\an8}I promise.

1765
02:00:46,333 --> 02:00:49,791
{\an8}Don't worry, we will give them a
few good whacks from your side, as well.

1766
02:00:53,791 --> 02:00:54,666
<i>Jai Hind,</i> ma'am.

1767
02:00:55,041 --> 02:00:56,791
The AOC has asked you
to come to the main gate.

1768
02:01:00,083 --> 02:01:01,000
{\an8}I will be right back.

1769
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:32,333
How are you?

1770
02:01:37,250 --> 02:01:38,125
Hey...

1771
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:41,375
you are an officer.

1772
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:44,083
Stop crying like a child.

1773
02:02:00,666 --> 02:02:02,583
Your mother would never say it...

1774
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:08,333
but I always wanted a son.

1775
02:02:12,541 --> 02:02:14,833
My father used to say that

1776
02:02:16,125 --> 02:02:17,375
a son is an asset...

1777
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:21,583
and a daughter is a responsibility.

1778
02:02:23,916 --> 02:02:25,958
That is why I kept
fulfilling my responsibility.

1779
02:02:28,916 --> 02:02:30,750
You wanted to fly high in the sky

1780
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:35,041
and I kept you caged
on the ground.

1781
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:38,875
But you still flew.

1782
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:41,958
And you flew so high

1783
02:02:42,833 --> 02:02:45,958
that to look at you today

1784
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,250
I need to raise my head.

1785
02:02:57,291 --> 02:02:58,791
Today, my daughter...

1786
02:03:00,708 --> 02:03:02,583
has defeated my father.

1787
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:13,083
I want to tell everyone with pride
that my daughter is a squadron leader

1788
02:03:14,833 --> 02:03:16,333
in the Indian Air Force.

1789
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:23,750
Can I have the privilege...

1790
02:03:25,625 --> 02:03:26,583
to say that?

1791
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:32,291
Can...

1792
02:03:34,625 --> 02:03:35,500
I...

1793
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:40,416
be forgiven,

1794
02:03:41,875 --> 02:03:43,041
my child?

1795
02:03:56,666 --> 02:03:57,666
So,

1796
02:03:59,625 --> 02:04:01,791
is that Pathania
just a friend of yours?

1797
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:06,208
- Dad...
- No, no, he's...

1798
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:08,083
a good chap.

1799
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:10,791
A true gentleman.

1800
02:04:21,333 --> 02:04:22,458
I have to go now.

1801
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,875
Minal.

1802
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:08,208
Thank you, Patty.

1803
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:12,375
You're welcome.

1804
02:05:17,083 --> 02:05:19,333
Minni! Rocky sir is calling
everyone for the briefing.

1805
02:05:22,166 --> 02:05:25,041
Garud commandos will do a HALO
jump from 30,000 feet

1806
02:05:25,416 --> 02:05:27,958
and from there they will head
towards the main target area...

1807
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:30,416
where Taj has been held hostage.

1808
02:05:30,833 --> 02:05:32,166
You will have 20 minutes

1809
02:05:32,416 --> 02:05:35,708
to extract Taj
and to destroy their base camp.

1810
02:05:36,416 --> 02:05:39,208
More than 100 militants
are guarding that area.

1811
02:05:40,333 --> 02:05:42,791
{\an8}And Azhar Akhtar will
also be among them.

1812
02:05:44,291 --> 02:05:48,416
Your coordination cannot be off
even by a single second.

1813
02:05:49,791 --> 02:05:51,583
They have ruthlessly
murdered Bash,

1814
02:05:51,666 --> 02:05:53,125
AIR DRAGONS
BRIEFING

1815
02:05:53,208 --> 02:05:55,041
but we will bring Taj back home.

1816
02:05:56,333 --> 02:05:57,625
Go get them, guys!

1817
02:05:58,666 --> 02:06:00,666
{\an8}<i>- Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!</i>

1818
02:06:00,791 --> 02:06:03,041
{\an8}<i>- Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!</i>

1819
02:06:08,791 --> 02:06:11,875
We are crossing LoC,
maintain external radio silence.

1820
02:06:13,666 --> 02:06:15,458
The IL-76 has crossed the LoC,

1821
02:06:15,583 --> 02:06:17,458
the Garud commandos will be
dropped in the next five minutes.

1822
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:19,125
Damn, this is so stressful.

1823
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:22,083
{\an8}Rocky, where are their
surface-to-air missiles?

1824
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:24,916
Here, sir. In this area.

1825
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:30,250
- Radio speed to 220.
- Roger.

1826
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,125
Get ready for the drop.

1827
02:06:39,916 --> 02:06:43,875
{\an8}PAKISTAN RADAR BASE

1828
02:06:50,333 --> 02:06:51,291
All stations alert!

1829
02:06:51,375 --> 02:06:53,416
Rawalakot Missile Squadron
standby to launch.

1830
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:55,833
An unidentified IL-76 has
entered our airspace.

1831
02:07:08,708 --> 02:07:09,666
{\an8}I called him here.

1832
02:07:13,375 --> 02:07:15,916
This is Radar Squadron 552
of the Pakistan Air Force.

1833
02:07:16,083 --> 02:07:18,750
You are in Pakistani airspace.
Identify yourself.

1834
02:07:18,916 --> 02:07:20,791
{\an8}<i>I repeat, identify
yourself right now.</i>

1835
02:07:21,833 --> 02:07:22,916
{\an8}Green on. Go!

1836
02:07:28,416 --> 02:07:31,291
Identify yourself now or
we will take offensive action.

1837
02:07:31,416 --> 02:07:34,541
<i>I repeat, identify yourself
now or we will fire our missiles.</i>

1838
02:07:38,333 --> 02:07:39,250
{\an8}Hello...

1839
02:07:40,458 --> 02:07:41,833
{\an8}No speak Hindi.

1840
02:07:42,125 --> 02:07:45,041
{\an8}This is a Russian passenger plane

1841
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:51,250
{\an8}Aeroflot 382 going
from Delhi to Moscow.

1842
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:56,833
{\an8}Please do not take offensive action.

1843
02:07:58,875 --> 02:08:02,916
{\an8}Is this Dubai air control?

1844
02:08:03,083 --> 02:08:05,916
No! You are in Pakistan airspace.
Report your heading.

1845
02:08:06,416 --> 02:08:08,041
Hameed, check the flight plans.

1846
02:08:08,208 --> 02:08:11,083
Is there any Aeroflot flight
that is an IL-76 model?

1847
02:08:18,208 --> 02:08:19,083
Yes, sir.

1848
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:21,333
A flight plan was filed yesterday at the
Delhi ATC at six o'clock in the evening,

1849
02:08:21,416 --> 02:08:23,250
and the model of the aircraft is an IL-76.

1850
02:08:25,291 --> 02:08:27,833
My compass not working.

1851
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:31,375
It show me we are cross Dubai.

1852
02:08:33,958 --> 02:08:36,083
{\an8}Help me, my good man.

1853
02:08:36,208 --> 02:08:39,291
Aeroflot 382,
our Pakistan airspace is shut.

1854
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:40,625
Turn back right now.

1855
02:08:44,041 --> 02:08:46,291
Your nearest runway is Jammu in India.

1856
02:08:46,541 --> 02:08:47,416
30 kilometers.

1857
02:08:47,500 --> 02:08:50,791
Establish contact. They will guide you.
Go for an emergency landing.

1858
02:08:52,541 --> 02:08:53,416
{\an8}Roger.

1859
02:08:53,791 --> 02:08:56,666
{\an8}Turning back, heading for Jammu.

1860
02:08:56,750 --> 02:08:58,583
We are watching you
till you cross our border.

1861
02:08:59,166 --> 02:09:03,666
{\an8}Sir, thank you for your help.
Enjoy Burj Khalifa!

1862
02:09:03,833 --> 02:09:07,291
{\an8}Rest in pieces.

1863
02:09:12,416 --> 02:09:15,083
Sandy, head for Rawalakot airfield.
I am going to Kotli.

1864
02:09:17,125 --> 02:09:18,750
Oh, shit! These are
actually three aircraft!

1865
02:09:18,916 --> 02:09:23,875
We have been tricked! Scramble.
Scramble. Scramble. Vector eight zero.

1866
02:09:26,333 --> 02:09:29,458
Two F-16s scrambling from Rawalakot.
Let's get them, Sandy!

1867
02:09:29,541 --> 02:09:30,416
Roger.

1868
02:09:37,041 --> 02:09:39,583
Bingo! That was for Bash!

1869
02:09:39,666 --> 02:09:41,333
Kotli and Rawalakot
airfields destroyed.

1870
02:09:41,458 --> 02:09:43,958
Commandos, time over target 03 minutes.

1871
02:10:01,291 --> 02:10:03,208
White Panther, target
heading towards you.

1872
02:10:12,041 --> 02:10:13,291
Launch Minni and Sukhi.

1873
02:10:13,375 --> 02:10:15,250
<i>The commandos need
to be picked up in 30 minutes.</i>

1874
02:10:22,625 --> 02:10:23,666
All teams. Proceed.

1875
02:10:29,208 --> 02:10:30,750
Tower one clear. Proceed.

1876
02:10:34,041 --> 02:10:35,041
Tower two clear.

1877
02:10:35,625 --> 02:10:36,708
Two bandits on Jeep.

1878
02:10:48,416 --> 02:10:50,708
Eagle Two, West Wing.
Eagle Three, South Wing.

1879
02:10:50,958 --> 02:10:52,125
Go, go, go!

1880
02:10:56,791 --> 02:10:59,291
- Who are these people?
- Indian commandos, sir.

1881
02:10:59,791 --> 02:11:00,666
What?

1882
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:04,333
They were supposed
to come tonight...

1883
02:11:06,791 --> 02:11:07,916
Zareena!

1884
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:14,208
I won't be requiring this anymore.

1885
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:16,291
I can no longer
operate in this sector.

1886
02:11:16,500 --> 02:11:18,291
{\an8}Thank you, Yafeth Salim.

1887
02:11:19,208 --> 02:11:20,833
{\an8}For misleading them.

1888
02:11:22,083 --> 02:11:22,958
Double agent?

1889
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:46,375
LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION

1890
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:11,583
Let's go, sir.

1891
02:12:13,333 --> 02:12:14,750
Azhar Akhtar can't be spared!

1892
02:12:15,583 --> 02:12:17,250
We need to take him with us.

1893
02:12:17,333 --> 02:12:19,875
Azhar is dead, sir. This camp
will explode at any moment.

1894
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,125
Visual on Taj.

1895
02:12:32,083 --> 02:12:33,083
He is safe.

1896
02:12:48,041 --> 02:12:49,000
Let's go home.

1897
02:12:51,541 --> 02:12:53,375
That bloody Azhar Akhtar got away!

1898
02:12:53,666 --> 02:12:55,083
Come in, Sukhi. I am taking off.

1899
02:12:55,166 --> 02:12:56,125
<i>Roger, Minni.</i>

1900
02:13:06,291 --> 02:13:08,375
Control, this is Sukhi.
Commandos loading.

1901
02:13:10,041 --> 02:13:11,291
Oh, shit! Shit, shit!

1902
02:13:25,958 --> 02:13:27,875
{\an8}This is control, Sukhi.
Sukhi, come in.

1903
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,750
Sukhi, this is control. Come in.

1904
02:13:30,041 --> 02:13:32,041
{\an8}Sukhi, come in.
Sukhi, this is control.

1905
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,041
Why isn't he responding?

1906
02:13:36,583 --> 02:13:38,958
{\an8}INDIAN AIR FORCE

1907
02:13:39,041 --> 02:13:41,041
{\an8}<i>Sukhi? Sukhi, this is control.</i>

1908
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:42,375
<i>Sukhi, come in.</i>

1909
02:13:43,125 --> 02:13:46,750
Sukhi, come in, Sukhi! This is con...

1910
02:13:46,916 --> 02:13:48,791
Sukhi, this is Patty. Come in.

1911
02:13:49,291 --> 02:13:50,458
Sukhi, come in damn it!

1912
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:53,750
Sukhi, can you hear me?

1913
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:56,125
Sukh...

1914
02:13:56,666 --> 02:13:59,916
{\an8}Nauty, check on Sukhi's chopper
and report immediately.

1915
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,333
Roger! Sandy, we are heading
towards the main target area.

1916
02:14:05,958 --> 02:14:08,250
Oh, shit! We are hit!

1917
02:14:08,666 --> 02:14:12,291
Ejecting, ejecting. I don't
know where the missile came from, sir.

1918
02:14:12,416 --> 02:14:14,375
I think there is an enemy
aircraft somewhere in the air.

1919
02:14:18,625 --> 02:14:20,583
Minni, turn back.
Look for Sukhi and Nauty.

1920
02:14:20,791 --> 02:14:23,000
Wilco, heading back.
Heading for the main target area.

1921
02:14:28,625 --> 02:14:31,208
Sandy, we are sending Minni
back for Nauty and Jai.

1922
02:14:31,291 --> 02:14:33,666
Stay in that area
and keep an eye out for enemy fighters.

1923
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:34,666
Roger.

1924
02:14:40,375 --> 02:14:43,041
Take position!
Take position behind the tank!

1925
02:14:55,208 --> 02:14:57,125
{\an8}Sir, I have reached
the main target area.

1926
02:14:57,375 --> 02:15:00,958
Sukhi's chopper has been destroyed and
there is heavy firing taking place.

1927
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:05,375
I am hit! I am hit!
I am moving away.

1928
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:09,166
{\an8}Sandy, cover Minni.

1929
02:15:09,333 --> 02:15:10,208
Roger.

1930
02:15:11,958 --> 02:15:13,708
I am dropping commandos for backup.

1931
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,208
Move! Move! Move!

1932
02:15:22,708 --> 02:15:24,625
{\an8}Sandy, we are launching
the reserve Sukhoi.

1933
02:15:25,458 --> 02:15:26,458
You're on, boys.

1934
02:15:26,791 --> 02:15:27,708
<i>Jai Hind,</i> sir.

1935
02:15:28,208 --> 02:15:30,375
Sir, someone else is already
sitting in the reserve Sukhoi.

1936
02:15:35,750 --> 02:15:37,791
Control, this is Patty
requesting for a Wizzo.

1937
02:15:40,666 --> 02:15:41,666
Permission denied.

1938
02:15:42,666 --> 02:15:44,833
Patty, get off the aircraft immediately.

1939
02:15:45,333 --> 02:15:47,750
Who gave you permission
to sit in the cockpit?

1940
02:15:47,833 --> 02:15:49,666
I am responsible for
my own actions, sir.

1941
02:15:50,291 --> 02:15:51,541
The ground staff has
nothing to do with it.

1942
02:15:51,625 --> 02:15:54,166
{\an8}I am warning you, Patty.
This is a court-martial offense.

1943
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,750
You can court-martial
me if I return, sir.

1944
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
This is my team, sir.

1945
02:15:59,791 --> 02:16:00,791
And they need me.

1946
02:16:02,333 --> 02:16:03,250
Please.

1947
02:16:04,083 --> 02:16:05,541
<i>I might have made some mistakes</i>

1948
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,625
but if you tell me that I am not
the best man to be out there right now

1949
02:16:09,208 --> 02:16:10,541
then I will get off
the aircraft right away.

1950
02:16:12,166 --> 02:16:15,333
And if not, then I request permission
for a Wizzo to join me, sir.

1951
02:16:15,833 --> 02:16:18,666
{\an8}Patty, there is no doubt that
you are our best fighter pilot

1952
02:16:19,291 --> 02:16:21,333
{\an8}but I can't break the rules for you.

1953
02:16:21,416 --> 02:16:22,375
{\an8}Let him go, sir.

1954
02:16:25,333 --> 02:16:26,208
{\an8}Rocky?

1955
02:16:26,541 --> 02:16:28,500
{\an8}I never thought
I would ever say this

1956
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:33,416
{\an8}but victory is far more important
than rules, sir.

1957
02:16:34,958 --> 02:16:36,750
{\an8}I want our best fighter pilot

1958
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:39,166
{\an8}in the sky right now

1959
02:16:40,458 --> 02:16:42,291
and I am willing to
accept responsibility for it.

1960
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,750
Patty is no longer
a part of your unit.

1961
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,458
{\an8}We are all one unit, sir.

1962
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:48,833
{\an8}The Indian Air Force.

1963
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:52,125
{\an8}I got him removed

1964
02:16:52,791 --> 02:16:54,291
{\an8}and now I want him back.

1965
02:16:55,333 --> 02:16:57,875
I will fly with him as his Wizzo.

1966
02:16:59,166 --> 02:17:00,916
This is now our team's fight.

1967
02:17:03,125 --> 02:17:04,083
Damn it!

1968
02:17:07,916 --> 02:17:08,833
Go, Rocky.

1969
02:17:09,916 --> 02:17:13,250
Now if there is a court-martial,
all of us are in it together.

1970
02:17:13,833 --> 02:17:15,208
So, you bloody well get them!

1971
02:17:26,041 --> 02:17:29,708
{\an8}<i>Sujalam sufalam malayaja sheetalam</i>

1972

1974
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:42,625

-Let's get them, Patty.

1975
02:17:45,208 --> 02:17:46,083
Yes, sir!

1976
02:17:47,083 --> 02:17:49,958
Control to Patty. You are clear
for take off. Runway 27.

1977
02:17:58,791 --> 02:17:59,833
SANDY

1978
02:18:00,375 --> 02:18:02,541
Lock. Lock.
Almost there, come on.

1979
02:18:02,625 --> 02:18:03,958
Two bogeys coming from behind us.

1980
02:18:05,791 --> 02:18:07,333
It's an ambush!

1981
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:08,541
<i>Disengaging.</i>

1982
02:18:12,625 --> 02:18:14,375
Lock. Lock. Lock. come on!

1983
02:18:14,458 --> 02:18:16,041
Command! Command! It's an ambush!

1984
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:17,916
LOCKED

1985
02:18:24,958 --> 02:18:27,791
Patty, you son of a gun!
Right on time!

1986
02:18:27,875 --> 02:18:30,375
Patty and Sandy, head towards
the main target area.

1987
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:40,125
There are too many of them, sir.
We can't hold on for long.

1988
02:18:40,208 --> 02:18:41,541
We are sending in reinforcements.

1989
02:18:46,791 --> 02:18:48,500
Patty, an enemy at eleven o'clock.

1990
02:18:49,375 --> 02:18:50,500
Roger. Going after him.

1991
02:18:50,666 --> 02:18:52,375
Sandy! Incoming missile!

1992
02:18:58,583 --> 02:19:01,291
Command, Sandy and Unni are hit.
I am going after the enemy.

1993
02:19:10,041 --> 02:19:11,875
Rocky, Patty, bandit six o'clock.

1994
02:19:18,291 --> 02:19:20,125
Patty! He is locking us!

1995
02:19:27,666 --> 02:19:28,833
Incoming missile!

1996
02:19:55,875 --> 02:19:58,000
Patty, the missile
is going to hit us!

1997
02:20:10,291 --> 02:20:12,750
Brilliant, Patty! One down, one to go.

1998
02:20:14,875 --> 02:20:15,750
Damn it!

1999
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:11,750
We are hit! We are hit, Patty!

2000
02:21:11,833 --> 02:21:14,541
They have got the avionics box
and the weapons system.

2001
02:21:19,333 --> 02:21:22,750
Fuel tank and undercarriage hit!
Let's get out of here!

2003
02:21:29,541 --> 02:21:30,750
Incoming missile!

LC EMERG EXT

2005
02:22:12,791 --> 02:22:15,583
What the hell are you planning, Patty?
Why are we turning back?

2006
02:22:42,125 --> 02:22:44,541
Patty, peel off!
Left-wing hit!

2007
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:49,666
Goodbye, Mr. Pathania,

2008
02:22:50,416 --> 02:22:53,833
I told you that there won't
be a countdown next time.

2009
02:22:53,916 --> 02:22:55,958
And I told you
that I will be eagerly waiting.

2010
02:22:57,625 --> 02:22:58,500
{\an8}CANNON EMPTY

2011
02:22:58,750 --> 02:23:00,916
Patty, pull up! It's an order!

2012
02:23:01,583 --> 02:23:02,833
Sir, it's time to...

2013
02:23:04,166 --> 02:23:05,083
take off your seatbelt.

2014
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:36,041
Like every Indian, you will also
die crawling on the ground.

2015
02:23:38,625 --> 02:23:42,041
I wasn't crawling.
I was just resting.

2016
02:23:44,375 --> 02:23:46,958
You Indians will never
lose your arrogance.

2017
02:23:49,666 --> 02:23:51,583
Basheer also
had a lot of arrogance.

2018
02:23:53,083 --> 02:23:56,250
You know what I did to him?

2019
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:05,250
I cut off his fingers one by one.

2020
02:24:15,958 --> 02:24:20,625
I left him alive even as I cut
his body into pieces.

2021
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,416
But he was still arrogant.

2022
02:24:30,875 --> 02:24:34,250
Then we showed him the Indian flag.

2023
02:24:39,708 --> 02:24:41,833
And then we burnt that flag.

2024
02:24:45,041 --> 02:24:47,333
That was when he started
screaming like a madman.

2025
02:24:50,208 --> 02:24:51,458
What was it that he said?

2026
02:24:52,541 --> 02:24:53,750
<i>Jai Hind...</i>

2027
02:24:55,416 --> 02:24:56,875
<i>Jai Hind!</i>

2028
02:24:59,958 --> 02:25:01,500
And that was when

2029
02:25:02,625 --> 02:25:04,166
I cut off his tongue.

2030
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:09,791
I took his life but couldn't
break his arrogance.

2031
02:25:12,166 --> 02:25:14,041
I will do the same with you.

2032
02:25:17,375 --> 02:25:18,291
Now say it.

2033
02:25:19,333 --> 02:25:20,250
<i>Jai Hind.</i>

2034
02:25:21,708 --> 02:25:22,583
Say it.

2035
02:25:23,625 --> 02:25:26,833
<i>- Jai...</i>
- Say it! Say, <i>Jai Hind!</i>

2036
02:25:27,125 --> 02:25:31,416
Say, <i>Jai Hind!</i>
Say, <i>Jai Hind!</i>

2037
02:25:31,833 --> 02:25:35,500
<i>Sujalam sufalam malayaja sheetalam</i>

2038
02:25:35,583 --> 02:25:39,416
<i>-Shasyashyaamalam vande mataram</i>
-Say it.

2039
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,083
Say it, Sukhi!

2040
02:25:43,541 --> 02:25:44,750
<i>Jai Hind!</i>

2041
02:25:46,333 --> 02:25:48,166
<i>Jai Hind!</i>

2042
02:26:00,666 --> 02:26:02,458
Now I will teach you
the meaning of <i>Jai Hind.</i>

2043
02:26:15,833 --> 02:26:18,166
<i>Jai Hind</i> is the pride
of every child in my country.

2044
02:26:20,083 --> 02:26:22,208
<i>Jai Hind</i> is the prayer
of every mother in my country.

2045
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:30,250
<i>Jai Hind</i> is the pride
of every single martyr of Pulwama.

2046
02:26:43,333 --> 02:26:45,875
<i>Jai Hind</i> is the salute
of Basheer's mother and father.

2047
02:26:51,791 --> 02:26:54,458
You can't belong to any nation!

2048
02:26:57,166 --> 02:26:59,166
Pakistan may be your father today

2049
02:27:00,291 --> 02:27:02,416
but India will always be my mother!

2050
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,750
POK stands for
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.

2051
02:27:08,166 --> 02:27:09,416
You have occupied it.

2052
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:13,166
But we are the owners!

2053
02:27:18,458 --> 02:27:22,166
If terrorists like you
push us to our limits

2054
02:27:22,916 --> 02:27:25,583
then every lane, every town,

2055
02:27:26,708 --> 02:27:28,000
every single inch...

2056
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:31,125
will turn into IOP.

2057
02:27:31,208 --> 02:27:37,375
<i>-Sujalam sufalam malayaja sheetalam</i>
-India Occupied Pakistan.

2058
02:27:38,166 --> 02:27:39,375
<i>Jai Hind!</i>

2059
02:27:41,541 --> 02:27:42,458
Sukhi, my boy.

2060
02:27:45,458 --> 02:27:46,416
Come.

2061
02:29:05,666 --> 02:29:06,958
Charlie one. Ten o'clock.

2062
02:29:50,666 --> 02:29:51,750
Taj, Rocky sir.

2063
02:30:31,958 --> 02:30:33,000
You are a terrorist.

2064
02:30:35,166 --> 02:30:36,750
Don't think of yourself as a martyr.

2065
02:30:38,583 --> 02:30:39,500
<i>Jai Hind.</i>

2066
02:30:39,666 --> 02:30:43,791
<i>Sujalam sufalam malayaja sheetalam</i>

2067
02:30:43,875 --> 02:30:47,791
<i>Shasyashyaamalam vande mataram</i>

2068
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,541
<i>Sujalam sufalam malayaja sheetalam</i>

2069
02:31:07,625 --> 02:31:11,333
<i>Shasyashyaamalam vande mataram</i>

2070
02:31:15,541 --> 02:31:19,166
<i>Sujalam sufalam malayaja sheetalam</i>

2071
02:31:19,250 --> 02:31:22,708
<i>Shasyashyaamalam vande mataram</i>

2072
02:33:02,458 --> 02:33:05,458
Blaming someone is
the easiest thing in the world.

2073
02:33:07,541 --> 02:33:08,833
And the most difficult

2074
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:10,875
is to face the truth.

2075
02:33:12,791 --> 02:33:13,916
A brother...

2076
02:33:15,583 --> 02:33:17,000
blamed you his whole life.

2077
02:33:18,958 --> 02:33:19,875
And you...

2078
02:33:21,375 --> 02:33:23,625
kept fulfilling your
responsibility like a fighter.

2079
02:33:29,708 --> 02:33:31,083
I am your culprit.

2080
02:33:33,250 --> 02:33:34,125
No, sir.

2081
02:33:36,583 --> 02:33:38,041
You are just my CO.

2082
02:33:47,666 --> 02:33:49,000
Well done, Patty! Well done!

2083
02:33:51,666 --> 02:33:52,708
Thank you, sir.

2084
02:33:54,208 --> 02:33:55,291
Patty, three o'clock.

2085
02:34:56,833 --> 02:34:59,333
- Very proud of you. Fantastic!
- Sir!

2086
02:34:59,958 --> 02:35:00,916
Congratulations.
