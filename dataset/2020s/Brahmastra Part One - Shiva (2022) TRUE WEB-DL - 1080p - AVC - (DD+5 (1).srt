1
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,666
<i>India, an ancient land...</i>

2
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:47,207
<i>whose history is woven
with the most amazing stories.</i>

3
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,666
<i>Let me tell you one such story...</i>

4
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:52,375
<i>about a group of great sages...</i>

5
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:56,332
<i>who meditated deeply in the Himalayas...</i>

6
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,125
<i>for which they received a Boon.</i>

7
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,958
<i>A divine Light (Brahm-Shakti)!</i>

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,542
<i>As that Light met the mountain...</i>

9
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,291
<i>Weapons of Power (Astras) were born.</i>

10
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,207
<i>Bearing the power of fire-
the Fire Stone (Agnyastra)!</i>

11
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,874
<i>The Water Stone (Jalāstra)!</i>

12
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,042
<i>And the Air Stone (Pawanāstra)!</i>

13
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:16,707
<i>Astras that contained the powers of
different animals and plants.</i>

14
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:20,542
<i>The sages had achieved what they desired.</i>

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,083
<i>But then, a cry arose from the Universe.</i>

16
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,457
<i>You see...</i>

17
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,666
<i>within the Light...</i>

18
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,124
<i>another Astra (weapon) was being born.</i>

19
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:39,041
<i>An Astra like Lord Shiva's Third Eye.</i>

20
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,332
<i>It could Create...</i>

21
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,041
<i>but also, Destroy.</i>

22
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:48,542
<i>The sages realised that this Great Astra
would have to be controlled.</i>

23
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:54,207
<i>Eventually, with great struggle and sacrifice...</i>

24
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,083
<i>the sages calmed the Light.</i>

25
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,124
<i>Then, at the peak of the mountain appeared...</i>

26
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,166
<i>the most powerful of all...</i>

27
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,166
<i>the Lord of all the Astras...</i>

28
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:09,042
<i>BRAHMĀSTRA!</i>

29
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:20,124
<i>The sages knelt before the Brahmāstra...</i>

30
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>and they called themselves...</i>

31
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,041
<i>The Brahmānsh!</i>

32
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:27,791
<i>Passing the Astras down generation to generation,</i>
<i>the Brahmānsh existed secretly in society...</i>

33
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:33,250
<i>protecting the Astras, and using
their Energies for the greater good.</i>

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,666
<i>Time moved forward...</i>

35
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,916
<i>each Age came and went by...</i>

36
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:41,374
<i>the world kept changing...</i>

37
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:46,083
<i>and with that change,
the world forgot about the Astras.</i>

38
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,457
<i>Now, let us jump ahead to modern India...</i>

39
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,667
<i>and meet a young man,
who doesn't know yet...</i>

40
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:07,083
<i>that the Fire which sleeps within him...
is going to Light up this World of Astras.</i>

41
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:10,416
<i>Today, on the Festival of Dussehra (Good vs Evil)...</i>

42
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,625
<i>a new Battle for the Brahmāstra is beginning...</i>

43
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:18,083
<i>and this young hero's destiny
is going to lead him into it!</i>

44
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,707
<i>His name is...</i>

45
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,000
<i>Shiva.</i>

46
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,375
I'll take that.

47
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,082
Well done, young cheetah...

48
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,375
you surprised me.

49
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,249
I'm Mohan.

50
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,582
And you?

51
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,167
Shut up and give me the Piece, calmly.

52
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,916
What fun's a hunt...

53
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,875
without a little chaos?

54
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,042
Now don't go trying to be a Hero, Scientist!

55
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,791
Another hunter...
and yet again, I didn't see you coming.

56
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,542
You know...

57
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,791
I really must be getting old.

58
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,292
No, wait.

59
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,083
Here you go, baby...

60
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,167
enjoy!

61
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,000
Not bad, huh?

62
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,875
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

63
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,000
Ouch!

64
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,541
Aye you, hunter Number Two!

65
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,082
You're no cheetah...

66
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,291
you're a bloody elephant!

67
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,291
Don't break everything, you brute!

68
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:04,124
Actually, you're no elephant...
elephants are wonderful.

69
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,083
You're a Hippo!
ZOR (Force) of a Hippo is in you.

70
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,792
Aye... ZOR (Force)!

71
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:11,791
That's a great name for you.

72
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:15,041
- Write it down or you'll forget it,
you stupid Hippo.

73
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,207
Come on, man!

74
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,292
Why so angry?

75
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,499
I can't find the Piece.

76
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,166
But he threw it right here.

77
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,125
Yeah, but it has disappeared!

78
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,707
Come let's give you a name, too!

79
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,166
You are in too much of a hurry,
hunting fast-fast-fast-fast!

80
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,457
Your name should be...

81
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,207
- RAFTAAR (Speed)!
- Where is the Piece, Scientist?

82
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,291
Tell us and we will spare your life!

83
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:41,250
Raftaar... Zor!
Hippo... Cheetah!

84
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,000
A solid team of hunters, you two!

85
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,042
But...

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,042
the animal you have come here to hunt...

87
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,042
is the jungle's...

88
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,291
most clever beast.

89
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,499
What's happening to him?

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,792
- He's got some new power!
- Can you guess which one?

91
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,500
THE MONKEY!

92
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:12,916
That Anklet!

93
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,042
Bye, friends!

94
00:08:29,417 --> 00:08:32,375
- Come on, Raftaar... your turn!

95
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,458
- Come on!

96
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,292
Not bad, cheets!

97
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,166
Okay, okay... wait, wait!

98
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:08,333
You guys know right,
that you can't possibly catch me?!

99
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,417
Enough of this game.

100
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:14,458
Now, I must fulfil my duty...

101
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,792
to the Brahmānsh!

102
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,083
So, bye!

103
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,167
Not even your Anklet
can carry you that high...

104
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,042
Monkey!

105
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,042
Zor, you still don't get it...

106
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,042
This is not an Anklet...

107
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,500
This is the...

108
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,250
STOP HIM!

109
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,417
Vānarāstra! (Super Monkey Weapon)

110
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,250
Damn, we lost him!

111
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,708
Fire...?

112
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:37,167
You can outrun Raftaar's speed...

113
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,249
overpower Zor's strength...

114
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,833
but you cannot escape
the obsession of JUNOON (Passion)!

115
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,000
Hello, Mr. Scientist.

116
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,417
Hunter...

117
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,625
you're the real Hunter.

118
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,667
Who are you?

119
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,791
But I already told you...

120
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,458
Junoon (Passion).

121
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,583
And now...

122
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,250
our Piece!

123
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,666
What are you going to do, Junoon?

124
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:22,375
Do you even realise the power in this Astra?

125
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:31,875
I understand this great Astra far
more deeply than you, Mr. Scientist.

126
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,542
It is my sole purpose.

127
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,875
You bring Darkness with you Junoon.

128
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,667
But, the Light is coming...

129
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,417
and in every Battle of the Brahmāstra...

130
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,708
the winner will always be...

131
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,083
the Light!

132
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,207
Hey, buddy?

133
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,333
- Hail Goddess Durga!

134
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,667
- Hail Goddess Durga!

135
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,542
- Shiva...

136
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,250
- Hail Lord Ram!

137
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,667
- Hail Lord Ram!

138
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,292
Aye, Shiva!

139
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,083
- Aye, what happened?!

140
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:52,207
- What a show we put up today!
We could play any world-class club.

141
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,499
- Swallow these big dreams
with these cheap snacks.

142
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,499
- What a cool AV you made, man.

143
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,666
- Like an inferno!

144
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:01,499
- Today was truly fun, man.

145
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,458
Mad party!

146
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,999
Ya but that Ravana Statue blast was freaky!

147
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,542
Maybe there was too much gunpowder in it?

148
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,042
This was supposed to
be a Dussehra celebration...

149
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,832
but it was more like Diwali.
(Festival of Lights and Fireworks)

150
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,999
Fire is a messed up thing.

151
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,332
Ohohoho... Mr. Shiva.
Good Morning, Mr. Shiva!

152
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,542
How are you?

153
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,458
Buddy!

154
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,083
How come you fainted like that, man?

155
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:30,667
I just overdid that Dance number!

156
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,666
From now on, I'll just make people dance...

157
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,333
and control my dance moves.

158
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Bro...

159
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,666
You're okay, right?

160
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,458
Yeah, I'm fine buddy. Let's go!

161
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,708
It's freakin' late guys!

162
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,458
- And we have that event tomorrow.
- Correct. Come on!

163
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:55,500
Sup bro?
Another penny for your thoughts?

164
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,458
Dude, there was this girl and...

165
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,083
she stole my heart!

166
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,042
Get lost!

167
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,208
<i>She stole my heart</i>

168
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,374
Breaking news!

169
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,166
Our friend sees a girl and faints.

170
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,624
But, but... what a girl?!

171
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,499
Whoever she was... she's gone!

172
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,000
You're never gonna find her again!

173
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,042
I'll find her.

174
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,124
- Eh Shiva! Come on, let's go!

175
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,292
- I'll find her!

176
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,875
Time's up! Pack up, gangsters!

177
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:48,792
Come on, come on!

178
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:08,707
- Aye, Shiva.

179
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:10,042
- What are you doing, man?

180
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,083
Shiva, what are you doing, man? Let's go!

181
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,457
- Aye, Shiva!
- Aye, Shiva!

182
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,332
- Tiger, come on!

183
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,583
- Where's he going?

184
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:51,832
Aye, Shiva!

185
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,916
Aye, Shiva! Wait!

186
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:53,957
Aye, Shiva!

187
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,125
Where are you going, man?

188
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,624
- Aye, lift! Wait!

189
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,499
Excuse me! Can we get a lift please?

190
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,917
This place is packed!

191
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,667
Excuse me, Madam!

192
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:27,875
Hi!

193
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:30,458
Who are you?

194
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,083
WHAT are you?

195
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:39,708
Say it.

196
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Say what?

197
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,500
Whatever’s on your mind.

198
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:47,458
I really like you.

199
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,083
Click!

200
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,417
Click?

201
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,958
Click means...

202
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,125
I'll always remember this moment.

203
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,250
What will you remember?

204
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,707
That I met a monkey...

205
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,875
and then he fell off the elevator!

206
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,000
Sorry.

207
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,999
Can this monkey have your phone number?

208
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,167
- Okay then!

209
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,499
And you, my Juliet from London.

210
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,291
- You please relax!
- Shaina didi.

211
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,582
Dude, you never who's a stalker!

212
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,875
We're taking you to
Putlu's Diwali party, Isha Di.

213
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,375
Isha...

214
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,833
So, Mr. Monkey...

215
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,000
will you come with us?
For Putlu's party?

216
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:34,249
Isha, I really want to come with you...

217
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,832
but I have to be somewhere else.

218
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,000
Like now... before midnight!

219
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,042
Why?

220
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,000
Do you transform into a beast at midnight?

221
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,124
Sorry for the disturbing.
But off we must be going!

222
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,250
Bro... time's up!

223
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:48,833
Sorry, Isha.

224
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:51,167
I made a promise to someone else...

225
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,917
to be at a Party!

226
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,542
I have to go.

227
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,042
Okay...

228
00:25:57,042 --> 00:25:57,958
go then!

229
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,749
Hey... you didn't give
me your number, Isha!

230
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,000
And you didn't invite me to your party.

231
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:06,582
- Meaning?

232
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,750
- What are you doing, man!
- Yeah, yeah... Relax!

233
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,708
Will you come out?
Just for a minute?

234
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,042
Isha?

235
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,792
- Okay. Shaina didi come.
- What the hell?

236
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:22,416
What the hell is going on?
Have you gone mad, Isha?

237
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,624
The elevator is gone!
We'll have to walk down now!

238
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,832
Shut up, Sunny!

239
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,833
- Guys?
- Hail Goddess Durga!

240
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,416
Guys, what the hell is going on over there?

241
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,832
Shaina didi, wait!

242
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:32,791
Isha...

243
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:36,166
what you said earlier, what did you mean?

244
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,916
I'm just saying...

245
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,582
I invited you with my cousins to our party.

246
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,375
Hmm...

247
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,792
But you didn't invite me to your party.

248
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,291
And that's fine.

249
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:48,583
Now go!

250
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,625
- Come on, Shiva!

251
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:55,958
Shiva.

252
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,249
Aye, boy! What are you doing?

253
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,832
I'm jumping off this building
to win your love, baby!

254
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:03,874
Aye!

255
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,542
- Oh my god dude!

256
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,082
- That was awesome!

257
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,291
I didn't ask you to come
with me for a reason.

258
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:10,708
What?

259
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,500
Say it!

260
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,167
You're wealthy.

261
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,667
You're obviously wealthy, right?

262
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,082
And where I'm going, where I'm from...

263
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,625
that's anything but wealthy.

264
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,792
You wouldn't be comfortable there, Miss.

265
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:31,208
So?

266
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,417
Are you ashamed of where you come from?

267
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,999
You didn't ask me to come along because...

268
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,375
actually you won't be comfortable.

269
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,250
It makes no difference to me.

270
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:45,792
Sure I'm rich... but I'm not shallow.

271
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,041
- Shaina didi.
- Mad skills bro, mad skills.

272
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,624
Take that! Gucci-Prada!

273
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,250
- Shaina didi-
- So then prove it!

274
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:54,874
And come for my party.

275
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,207
- We're not coming anywhere, okay!

276
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,750
I know you want to come.

277
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,832
No we don't want to go with you,
and neither does she!

278
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,000
Isha, tell him!

279
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,707
I don't know...

280
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,166
it could be fun.

281
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,999
Thousand percent! Let's go!

282
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,207
- Don't go anywhere, Didi!
- Bloody English medium...

283
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,207
I'm taking you to this season's
best Diwali party!

284
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:14,291
Let my brother go!

285
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,291
Can you jump?

286
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,583
There is no need,
we have a car you know!

287
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,249
Isha! Yo!

288
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,416
- Isha, listen to me!

289
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,458
Isha...

290
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,624
can you trust me?

291
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,457
- Isha, this is a really bad idea!

292
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:26,416
- Isha, stop!

293
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:27,999
Isha! Oh my god!

294
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,749
- NO!
- Oh! She did it!

295
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,166
- Too good!

296
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,582
Come on, jump!

297
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,417
- Jump!
- Jump, jump!

298
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:38,332
You okay?

299
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,250
I survived?

300
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:46,250
Now?

301
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:47,582
Now?

302
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,167
Now we have to run, let's go.

303
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:50,083
Okay...

304
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,166
let's go!

305
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:53,458
- Oh, we aren't there yet?
- Let's go!

306
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,999
Now we have to run.

307
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,167
I know...

308
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:59,500
Then stop staring at me.

309
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,958
- Baby, get on that snake ladder!

310
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,791
Aye, red shirt!

311
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,541
- I have a name, madam! Tiger!
- Arrey, it's dangerous ya!

312
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,708
- C'mon Sunny, carefully but come.

313
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,000
- It's going to be midnight soon guys!

314
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,207
So, what happens at midnight?

315
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:16,167
Birthday!

316
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,750
Whose?

317
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,249
Girlfriend.

318
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh!

319
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,166
Then we definitely can't be late.

320
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,957
- Come on, you posh people, hurry up!

321
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,875
I'm scared, Didi!

322
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:31,417
Sunny, don't kill my vibe!

323
00:29:58,708 --> 00:29:59,708
There!

324
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,249
- Isha...
- Yes?

325
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,416
So, I don't actually have a girlfriend.

326
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,625
Okay!

327
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:06,832
And you?

328
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:08,750
I don't have a girlfriend, either!

329
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,125
- You're late, Shiva dada!
- Shut up, shorty. It's not 12 yet!

330
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:18,999
Someone's won a big hand this Diwali.

331
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,042
Hi babes.

332
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:20,916
Hi handsome.

333
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,207
Move move, hero!

334
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,249
- 10...

335
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,499
- 9...

336
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,707
- 8...

337
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:26,957
- 7...

338
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:27,999
6...

339
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,207
5...

340
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,374
- 4...

341
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,499
- 3...

342
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,666
- 2...

343
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,541
- 1!

344
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,957
<i>You were born in the zoo...</i>

345
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,207
<i>with lions and tigers...</i>

346
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:41,541
<i>and monkeys like you...</i>

347
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:45,208
<i>Happy Birthday to you!</i>

348
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,000
<i>Happy Birthday to you!</i>

349
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:52,875
Isha...

350
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,832
I'm at a Diwali party for kids...
who would've thought.

351
00:30:57,833 --> 00:31:00,416
Why are there so many random kids here?

352
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,999
You idiot, this is an orphanage.

353
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,167
Come, babes.

354
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,708
Huh?

355
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:15,166
I thought you wouldn't be able
to leave your DJ show.

356
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:18,208
To see this smile, I'd leave any show!

357
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,000
- You're the best, Dada.
- And you're not so bad yourself!

358
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,000
Aye Shiva, let's dance!

359
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,000
Yes! Let's dance, Shiva dada!

360
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,708
Dance dance dance!

361
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,000
Show us that step of yours!

362
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,333
Are you serious?

363
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,083
- Kids, custard?
- Leave it man!

364
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,374
- Want some custard?
- No man, I'm lactose intolerant.

365
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,457
- What's that?
- I can't digest milk.

366
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:45,375
What did your mother feed you then, juice?

367
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:48,374
Aye! He never drank his mother's milk!

368
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,791
Aye, half-pint!
Who do you think you are?

369
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:51,957
I'll give you one tight one?

370
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,250
- Wait, I'm climbing up!

371
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,958
Leave some custard for the kids too!

372
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,832
Kids! Time to burst crackers, come on!!

373
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,666
- Shiva, coming?
- No!

374
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,166
He's not coming anywhere...

375
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:03,874
he's got a firecracker of his own tonight!

376
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,917
Gannu, you little swine!
Be careful out there.

377
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,000
Say it.

378
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:17,000
Whatever's on your mind, just say it.

379
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,458
Who are you?

380
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,875
Tell me, Mr. India...

381
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,708
these kids?

382
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,625
They're MY kids.

383
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,957
You take care of them?

384
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,542
And they take care of me.

385
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:35,958
I never want them to feel
they don't have family.

386
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,708
And you?

387
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,958
And I...

388
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:48,167
I'm also one of them.

389
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,333
I was born here.

390
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,000
So, Shiva...

391
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:59,500
you know nothing about
your mother or father?

392
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,125
My father is a riddle.

393
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,832
He was the real Mr. India (Vanishing Hero)!

394
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:07,625
He'd disappeared before I was born.

395
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:12,958
Actually, this joke always kind of stings.

396
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,207
In our society, a man's identity
comes from his father.

397
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,207
No father. No family name!

398
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,791
That's why I'm just...

399
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,749
SHIVA!

400
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,250
Nothing before. Nothing after.

401
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:30,250
I'm thinking that whoever I marry,
I'll just take her family name.

402
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,542
By the way, what's your last name?

403
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
So this is my cave.

404
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,333
And what about your mother, Shiva?

405
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,417
My mother?

406
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,291
In my mind...

407
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,708
she's a Goddess.

408
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:57,417
Like all mothers are!

409
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,667
What happened to her?

410
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,000
I lost her.

411
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,207
When I was about a year old.

412
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:10,000
My landlady tells me she used to live
with me in this very room.

413
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:14,791
When I started earning money,
I rented this room back from her.

414
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:18,583
Living here, somehow makes me
feel closer to my mother.

415
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,458
This conch shell was my mother's.

416
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,625
And it is all that she left behind for me.

417
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:33,833
So I made it the main
attraction of my Temple.

418
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,958
What happened to her?

419
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:39,917
Please don’t ask!

420
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,457
If YOU ask, I’ll have to tell you.

421
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:45,083
And you've already learnt
too much about me!

422
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,917
Your life must have been so hard?

423
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:51,833
No not really.

424
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,708
I mean, there have been hard times...

425
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,083
but life has always been beautiful.

426
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:04,125
What's wrong?

427
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,333
Why are you crying?

428
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,000
Should I get you more custard?

429
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,583
I'm sorry.

430
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:16,542
I know that I'm an unwealthy
orphan chap...

431
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,792
but truly, my life is good.
Totally first class!

432
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,917
But that's the thing...

433
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:26,167
despite everything, you're still first-class.

434
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,250
You had nothing, Shiva.

435
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,042
Not even your parents!

436
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,000
But instead of complaining about life...

437
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,250
you love it!

438
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:42,874
Your attitude is so nice, Shiva.

439
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,292
How?

440
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,667
Should I tell you?

441
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,500
Now that I've made you cry,
let me cheer you up a bit.

442
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,458
I live by a very simple theory.

443
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,541
When life gets a bit Dark...

444
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:04,417
then, ladies and gentlemen...

445
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,667
find the Light.

446
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,042
Light?

447
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:13,083
Explain?

448
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,916
Light can't be explained...

449
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:19,125
it can only be felt.

450
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,125
Still, for you...

451
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:22,542
I’ll try, Isha Madam.

452
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,083
Light - is what protects us
when faced with any darkness.

453
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,667
It is that special power...

454
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:40,000
which brings meaning to our lives.

455
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,207
And where do you find this Light?

456
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,583
In Goddess Durga.

457
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,833
In the smiles of my kids.

458
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:51,125
In music.

459
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:00,042
Sometimes I even find it
in my Landlady's custard.

460
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:04,083
If you look with a pure heart,
you can find the Light everywhere.

461
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,083
So, ladies and gentlemen...

462
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,292
keep searching for the Light.

463
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,000
Because whenever you find it...

464
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,583
It will remind you...

465
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,208
that life is beautiful.

466
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:20,792
Understood.

467
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:22,958
Light.

468
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,333
Like tonight...

469
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,708
I found you, Isha...

470
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,250
and I found the Light.

471
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,583
What happened, Shiva?

472
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,541
Shiva, are you okay?
Can I get you something?

473
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:22,792
Isha! Please!

474
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,167
- Fire!
- Shiva, you-

475
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,458
What's happening, Shiva?
I'm not understanding this!

476
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,667
- Shiva!
- I'm sorry I'm-

477
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,666
I've got to go!

478
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,958
Shiva?

479
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,417
- Seven days!

480
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,624
- It has taken me seven days to break you.

481
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:43,458
- But now you are fully under
our control, Mr. Scientist.

482
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:55,458
- I SUMMON THE VASH MUKUT (Crown of Control)!

483
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,625
- A Great power...

484
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,041
- Darkness.

485
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,041
- Surrender to it!

486
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,166
- And show me...

487
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,166
- you are the Protector of the First Piece.

488
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,250
- Who keeps the Second?

489
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,124
- Three Pieces...

490
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,624
- Three Pieces...

491
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,249
- The Second Piece?

492
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,042
- Is it with the Artist?

493
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:30,250
- Show me.

494
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:36,625
- Varanasi...

495
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,583
- Varanasi...

496
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,750
- Kashi...

497
00:40:40,292 --> 00:40:41,083
- Kashi...

498
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,292
- Your friend!

499
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,916
- The Artist...

500
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,541
- Is the Keeper of the Second Piece.

501
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,250
- My friend...

502
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:49,708
- Artist...

503
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,958
- ANISH SHETTY!

504
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,583
Let me help you, Shiva.

505
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:09,833
Let it be!

506
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:10,792
There's-

507
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,167
There's nothing you can do!

508
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,292
Please!

509
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:22,999
- Now...

510
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,624
- The Third Piece!

511
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,083
- Show us, Scientist.

512
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,083
The Third Piece...

513
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:29,958
The Third Piece...

514
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,791
- Show us, Scientist.

515
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:34,499
- The Third Piece.

516
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,166
- The Third Piece.

517
00:41:36,167 --> 00:41:37,667
- Where?

518
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,749
- The third piece of the Brahmāstra...

519
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,417
- Is it with the Guru?

520
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,792
- Guru...

521
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:47,124
- Guru...

522
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:47,916
- Guruji...

523
00:41:47,917 --> 00:41:49,750
- The Brahmānsh's Guru...

524
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,833
- Guruji...

525
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:52,666
- Who is it now?

526
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,666
- Who?

527
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,125
- And where is he?

528
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:56,582
- The Ashram...

529
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,999
- Where is the Ashram?

530
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,250
- The Ashram...

531
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,291
- The Ashram...

532
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,416
- Ashram!
- Ashram... where?

533
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:03,999
Ashram...

534
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,583
- Who is the Guru?

535
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,624
- Where is the Ashram!

536
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,875
- Enough...

537
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,167
- Enough...

538
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,333
- Enough.

539
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:19,124
Enough.

540
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,291
- The Brahmānsh's Guru.

541
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,667
- Who is it now?

542
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,457
- And where is he?

543
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,624
- Where is the Ashram?

544
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,292
- Who's the Guru?

545
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,208
- The Ashram...

546
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:30,957
- where?

547
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:32,791
- Enough!
- Who is the Guru?

548
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,582
- Where is the Ashram!
- ENOUGH!

549
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:36,083
ENOUGH!

550
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,041
I will tell you nothing else.

551
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:10,124
You've lost, Scientist.

552
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,250
Just accept defeat.

553
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:16,582
Far greater than your passion, Junoon...

554
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,499
is my duty.

555
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,583
Aye!!

556
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,667
Oh and...

557
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,333
I never lose.

558
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,542
Have you started doing drugs, Shiva?

559
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,957
Don't lecture me, uncle...

560
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:05,292
it's not like I slept in your house!

561
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:07,957
- This isn't your father's building!
- Ya, so what?

562
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,083
It's mine!

563
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:12,167
Isha...

564
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,166
- What happened?

565
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,083
I don't know what happened...

566
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,499
the whole night got ruined.

567
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,124
- Take care of yourself, Shiva.

568
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,707
Have you completely lost it?
Where did you disappear?

569
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:30,249
She waited for two hours for you,
before leaving.

570
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,749
Where do I find her now?

571
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,166
Yeah exactly...
because she actually lives in London!

572
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,957
But she's staying at
her grandfather's house here.

573
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,541
Not just a house... it's a palace!

574
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,582
They're real big-shots.

575
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:42,791
Ya totally out of your league, Shiva!

576
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,207
How do you'll know all this?

577
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,457
I know everything!

578
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,250
Aye, Shorty...

579
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:49,207
I'm going to hang you
upside down and whack you!

580
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,624
- Relax, Dada...

581
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,875
she's our Facebook friend now.

582
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,166
The festival (pandal) you played at
the other day belongs to her family!

583
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,583
There's another celebration
there today, too.

584
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,957
Chant the Name of Goddess Kali!

585
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,417
Maa! (For Goddess Kali)

586
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:29,292
- You are fully under
our control, Mr. Scientist.

587
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:31,207
- Great power...

588
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:32,457
- Anish Shetty.

589
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,207
- Your friend... Artist?

590
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:35,416
- The Three Pieces...

591
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:37,292
- Who keeps the Second?

592
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,416
- Varanasi...
- The Third Piece...

593
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:41,666
- Kashi...
- Your friend... Artist?

594
00:45:41,667 --> 00:45:42,624
- The Ashram...

595
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:43,541
- Guruji!

596
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:45,666
- Guruji!
- The Brahmānsh's Guru...

597
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,541
- who is it now?

598
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,000
ENOUGH!

599
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:53,000
Help me, Maa.

600
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,707
Does this laptop have internet?

601
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:22,541
This whole place has Wi-Fi.

602
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:24,541
You can WhatsApp God if you want to!

603
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:25,541
Move!

604
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:27,999
Hey, you can't really do that!
I was just joking, man!

605
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,875
One minute!

606
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:32,416
- Let me be, please.
I'll lose my job!

607
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:34,083
Let me finish my work!

608
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:41,999
<i>The suicide of famous Scientist
Mohan Bhargav has shocked the nation!</i>

609
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,207
<i>Last night, Scientist Mohan Bhargav...</i>

610
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:47,999
<i>jumped off the balcony of
his penthouse and took his own life.</i>

611
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,541
<i>Social media is abuzz with famous personalities
and politicians expressing their grief. </i>

612
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:54,917
Who is playing this News so loudly?

613
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,542
Hey, did you know this man?

614
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,999
<i>Delhi Police is investigating
this case deeply.</i>

615
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,832
<i>We will continue to update you
on this shocking incident.</i>

616
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:10,832
<i>But on the happy occasion of Diwali,
for a Scientist of this stature...</i>

617
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:14,542
<i>to commit suicide is
a huge blow for the nation-</i>

618
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,457
Everyone! Please go ahead
and take a 10 minute break...

619
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:29,541
- we're all set for the celebration tonight.

620
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:33,792
Let me look around calmly to see
if everything's up to Grandpa's standards.

621
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,916
Please go take a snack break.

622
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:39,208
Madam, I ate before I got here.

623
00:47:39,542 --> 00:47:41,499
So now eat a little more. Please!

624
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,708
- Okay.

625
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,792
This Scientist who was on the News...

626
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:47,833
is famous?

627
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,708
SpaceHind is one of
the country's biggest companies.

628
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:53,708
Shiva!

629
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,458
What is going on with you?

630
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,749
Isha, my life has certain mysteries...

631
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,542
which are very strange.

632
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,083
Shiva...

633
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,542
can you trust me?

634
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,832
This Scientist's death
that's on the News...

635
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,832
I saw a live broadcast of this.

636
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,999
In a dream but...

637
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,667
it was more than a dream!

638
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:21,582
What?

639
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,875
Yes, Isha...

640
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:27,792
that's what was happening to me last night
when I was getting those electric shocks!

641
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:30,416
- Shiva, you-
- Ya sure Laugh!

642
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:34,292
I feel like laughing at myself too,
for having fully lost the bloody plot!

643
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:39,750
That wasn't a suicide, Isha...

644
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:41,167
it was murder.

645
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:45,708
That Scientist was trying to
save himself from those three killers.

646
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,375
Something extraordinary
is going on in this world, Isha...

647
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:53,042
something beyond the
understanding of normal people...

648
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,042
There are ancient Weapons of Light.

649
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:58,083
Astras.

650
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:04,000
That Scientist is a part of something
called the Brahmānsh... was.

651
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,583
There's some Guru...

652
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,666
and now...

653
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:09,667
Now what?

654
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,999
Now those killers are
looking for someone else...

655
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,542
in Varanasi.

656
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:17,707
I've seen him, too...

657
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:18,875
Anish...

658
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:20,792
Anish Shetty!

659
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,125
But... why are YOU seeing all of this?

660
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,417
Who are you, Shiva?

661
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:34,792
What did you say?

662
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:37,167
Anish Shetty?

663
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,541
I've definitely heard that name.

664
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:41,333
Anish... Shetty...

665
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,958
That's him!

666
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,374
I couldn't remember clearly...
but he's a famous guy, too.

667
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,833
Artist, architect...

668
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,999
and the News says he's
working on a Heritage Site...

669
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,333
in Varanasi!

670
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,833
Isn't this what you saw?

671
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,207
What the-

672
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,832
So this man is real, too?

673
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,541
What is all this weird stuff,
that's happening to you?

674
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:11,042
Forget about me, what's going to
happen to this Artist now?

675
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,750
Shiva, you should report
all this to the police!

676
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:20,166
What do I say...
that I see stuff in my head?

677
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:22,333
Who will believe me?

678
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,417
I do...

679
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:28,167
I believe... you.

680
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:32,458
I feel like you'll never lie to me.

681
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,374
Isha, I left you alone
and ran off yesterday...

682
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,042
I'm sorry.

683
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:42,583
Forgiven.

684
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:45,082
But on one condition only...

685
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:48,708
promise me, you won't keep
any more secrets from me.

686
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:54,832
- Hail Goddess Kali!
- Who the heck?!

687
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,999
That's my grandpa!
He used to be a priest.

688
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,541
- Hail Goddess Kali!
- Don't worry, he'll go back to sleep.

689
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:00,374
Grandpa!

690
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,708
Sleep!

691
00:51:08,042 --> 00:51:10,083
What are you thinking now, hero?

692
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:14,542
I'm going to Varanasi.

693
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:16,458
What?

694
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,750
This Artist needs to be saved...

695
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:22,458
this is now my responsibility.

696
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:24,250
Are you serious?

697
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:27,375
But Shiva, you could be in danger there!

698
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,500
Goddess Kali's blessings are now with me.

699
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:39,082
It's the season of Diwali
(The festival of Lights)!

700
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:40,500
Whatever comes...

701
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:43,083
I'll face it.

702
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:58,375
Maybe I should come
along with you to Varanasi.

703
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,708
Come on.

704
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:04,542
I'm serious... I'll come.

705
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,125
Actually...

706
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,667
I am coming... with you.

707
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,750
Don't be ridiculous.

708
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:16,667
You can't just come to Varanasi.

709
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,333
Shiva...

710
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,457
I'm coming.

711
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,999
- But Isha, it could be dangerous there-
- The flowers have arrived!

712
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,333
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

713
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,625
Shiva...

714
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,833
everything that is
happening in your life...

715
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:36,000
it feels like destiny has something
very special planned for you.

716
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:41,374
And for us to have met like this...
that's destiny too, isn't it?

717
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:45,417
Maybe... we've met so that I can help you.

718
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,875
But Isha, out there I don't know
what could happe-

719
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:49,917
Isha!

720
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,833
Do you know the meaning of 'Isha'?

721
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:56,958
Parvati (Lord Shiva's Wife).

722
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:03,250
And without Parvati... Shiva is incomplete.

723
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,500
Okay?

724
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,499
Shiva, is your hand alright?!

725
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,708
Isha, I don't burn in fire.

726
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,999
I have a strange connection with fire.

727
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Fire doesn't burn me.

728
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,291
Isha I know you're sca-

729
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:52,042
Why did you hide this from me?!

730
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,375
Isha...

731
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:55,916
Isha, please!

732
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,708
WHO ARE YOU?

733
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,582
- What other secrets are you still hiding?!
- This is the last one...

734
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,166
I swear... and the biggest.

735
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:03,875
I was just a kid when I found out...

736
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:06,207
that I was different somehow
because fire didn't burn me!

737
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,457
This Thing was so freaky that
I never told anyone...

738
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:11,374
and I just buried it deep within myself.

739
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:12,417
Isha...

740
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:13,832
my room...

741
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,708
there was a fire there... in which my-

742
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:21,375
I didn't burn but everything was destroyed!

743
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,374
But Shiva this...

744
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,041
this fire on the water,
coming towards you...

745
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:27,957
what is all this?

746
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:30,124
I have no idea, Isha. No idea!

747
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:31,541
This thing in me is growing...

748
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,041
my connection with fire,
is waking up suddenly!

749
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:37,375
- Since when?!
- Since a few days now, ever since-

750
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:45,958
I'm sorry I-

751
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:49,042
I'm sorry I scared you.

752
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:52,999
I could never be scared of you.

753
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,750
Please don't ever cry because of me.

754
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:57,875
Then don't keep things from me!
Just tell me everything, Shiv-

755
00:58:57,917 --> 00:58:59,417
I love you.

756
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:04,417
I've been in love with you
since the moment I saw you.

757
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,041
I don't know how I know this...

758
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:11,333
but I just know that
I will love you forever.

759
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,708
Thank you!

760
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:30,207
Shiva...

761
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:32,000
Isha...

762
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,291
they are those three killers!

763
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:38,374
- Raftaar, Zor and Junoon.

764
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,707
We have to get to the Artist before them.

765
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,000
Let's go!

766
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,332
How are we going to find him in this chaos?

767
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:59,291
I don't even see your killers anywhere.

768
00:59:59,292 --> 01:00:02,042
- They're not MY killers!
- Sorry!

769
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,208
Isha... up there!

770
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,999
- Raftaar!

771
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,708
How did he get up there?

772
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:18,500
He has the... Scientist's Anklet.

773
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:23,167
The Vānarāstra!

774
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:28,416
Why is he looking at us?

775
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,416
He's not looking at us.

776
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:32,000
Shiva...

777
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:34,042
Artist!

778
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:38,875
We have to get him out of here quietly.

779
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:39,958
How?

780
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,374
Where the hell is he going?

781
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:45,542
Shiva!

782
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,832
Did you see him jump?
He's like a circus monkey!

783
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:52,042
Don't get too excited now. Focus!

784
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,750
Where's he going off alone?

785
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:06,499
He's safer around the crowds!

786
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,750
Your other two killers
could be anywhere, Shiva.

787
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:11,333
- They're not MY killers, Isha!
- Sorry!

788
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,458
What's wrong?

789
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:32,249
What are you doing?

790
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,792
Shiva, go! I have a plan!

791
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,166
You just come with me, Isha!

792
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:37,457
Shiva, they don't
recognize us so we're safe!

793
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:39,000
You just get to the Artist.

794
01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:40,375
Go!

795
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,624
- I've got some personal work to do...

796
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,457
so I'll be in my office.

797
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:58,041
But I'm very happy.
Everything is going off well.

798
01:01:58,042 --> 01:01:59,374
- Sir, it's all because of your hard work!

799
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:01,166
- Go enjoy the festival.
- Thank you sir!

800
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,583
- Sir!
- Not now, please.

801
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,042
Can I-

802
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,583
- What's wrong?

803
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:23,332
Excuse me!

804
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,166
Where is the main fair here?

805
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,458
- Where I can get some snacks?
- I don't know!

806
01:02:28,583 --> 01:02:29,583
Oh no!

807
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:31,582
My battery just died!

808
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,166
May I borrow your phone please?

809
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:36,041
My sister is here somewhere
and I need to find her.

810
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:36,832
Please give it...

811
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,957
outgoing calls are really cheap these days!

812
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:42,042
Madam, ask someone else.
I'm in a hurry.

813
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,374
I was just asking for some help...

814
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:48,792
not like I asked for your kidney... cheapo!

815
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:09,542
I know you're a member of the Brahmānsh.

816
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:14,041
There's no time to explain everything,
but your life is in danger.

817
01:03:14,042 --> 01:03:17,208
You have to get out of here, Sir
and I've come to help you.

818
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,333
Shiva, I'm fine!

819
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,375
What a gangster you are!

820
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:31,083
Where are you?

821
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,499
Look outside the room you're in...

822
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,541
you'll see an under construction area.

823
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:38,582
- I'm there, on the floor below you!

824
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,457
Okay listen, I'm getting out of here...

825
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,624
you get the Artist quickly
and meet me at the main gate.

826
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,958
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

827
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:49,417
- Found your phone?

828
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,082
You shouldn't have gotten mixed up in this.

829
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:57,624
Who are you?

830
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,082
And where is Anish?

831
01:03:59,083 --> 01:03:59,832
Shiva!

832
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,292
I heard your entire conversation...

833
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:04,750
I know you know where Anish is.

834
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,042
- SHIVA!

835
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:16,333
- Where is Anish?

836
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:19,000
Tell me or else...

837
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,083
Shiva!

838
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:50,625
Shiva!

839
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,542
Raftaar, no!

840
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:37,167
Shiva!

841
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:10,542
Come on... let's go!

842
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:23,375
How many are they?

843
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,125
- This way, Sir.
- Let's go!

844
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:55,917
Hey... keys!

845
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:00,958
- Drive!

846
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,499
He's in really bad shape.

847
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,041
We have to take him to the hospital.

848
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:24,917
No!

849
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,457
You two can get off,
I'll handle things from here.

850
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:29,750
You've been shot, Sir!
Do you want to die?

851
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,042
Shiva!

852
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,541
I just need to get there.

853
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:35,457
Where, Sir?

854
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:36,583
The Ashram?!

855
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,458
Where the Brahmānsh's Guru lives?

856
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:47,292
The Brahmānsh has remained
a secret... always.

857
01:07:47,792 --> 01:07:50,083
But those three know everything!

858
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,792
And so do you two... how?

859
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:58,542
Sir, Shiva's right!
We have to take you to the hospital.

860
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:04,083
"Sahasra Nandim Samarthyam"
(Sanskrit Chants)

861
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:08,667
"O Nandi Astram"

862
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,250
Nandi Astra! (Nandi is the Sacred Bull)

863
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:20,333
I'm okay.

864
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:23,624
Just tell us the address of the Ashram.

865
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:24,792
I can't.

866
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:26,582
You have to!

867
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:29,250
Because getting you to
the Ashram is my responsibility!

868
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:31,417
OUR responsibility.

869
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:33,833
Sir!

870
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:37,750
Punch in the address here
or we'll take you straight to the hospital!

871
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:45,917
- Here...

872
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,875
- Sir, this says we're 20 hours away...

873
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:52,958
- where are we going?

874
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:57,082
- To the birthplace of Indian History...

875
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,792
- the Himalayas!

876
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:40,124
If you two are done with this
Lovers Point Sunrise, should we get going?

877
01:09:40,125 --> 01:09:42,249
Sir, we were waiting for you to wake up.

878
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,250
She thought maybe you've popped it!

879
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:47,458
You look much better, Sir.
Let me see.

880
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,667
Your wound has healed completely.

881
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,250
My partner is taking care of me.

882
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,582
Nandi Astra!

883
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,916
Which has the power
of a thousand bulls in it.

884
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:01,041
"Sahasra Nandim Samarthyam"

885
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:02,042
Sir...

886
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:04,292
is there an Astra...

887
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,542
which is in pieces?

888
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:08,958
Triangle type...

889
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:13,958
but if you join it, it becomes round.

890
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:15,958
Like a pizza!

891
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:18,708
Uh...

892
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,917
Brahmāstra!

893
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,667
Brahmāstra?

894
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:35,082
Who are you, Shiva?

895
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:36,666
How do you know all of this?

896
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,042
Sir, what is the Brahmāstra?

897
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,875
"Sarva Astra Pradhānam"

898
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,375
"Srishti Vijayeta Karākam"

899
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,667
Our pride!

900
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:50,707
Our honor!

901
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,625
The Heart of the Brahmānsh!

902
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,917
That has the power of
the entire Universe within it!

903
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:01,499
The Lord of all the Astras-

904
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,250
Brahmāstra!

905
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:05,374
Yes, sir. Exactly!

906
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:08,249
Those killers are after this Brahmāstra!

907
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,041
We need to get to the Ashram.

908
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:13,250
So... you have a piece
of the Brahmāstra, right?

909
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:17,500
Can we see it?

910
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,750
What's wrong with you?

911
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:41,958
Shiva!

912
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:45,666
Sir, he's getting those Visions again!

913
01:11:45,667 --> 01:11:46,457
Shiva!

914
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:48,041
Let it happen, Isha...

915
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,792
I want to see!

916
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,625
Stone... that stone is waking up!

917
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:58,958
Who?

918
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:00,833
Who is that?

919
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:04,917
Me?

920
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:07,500
You?

921
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,000
Us!

922
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,625
Here?!

923
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,583
They're watching us!

924
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:26,667
Sir...

925
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,042
the killers are in that truck!

926
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,458
Run!

927
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:41,833
Isha...

928
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:45,082
they can't get their hands on this Piece.

929
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:47,625
Get this to the Guru, whatever it takes... go!

930
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,417
Sir, please get into the car!

931
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,875
- Then who will stop them?

932
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,667
No way! We can't leave you alone, please!

933
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:59,374
To protect the Brahmāstra
is my duty, Shiva.

934
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,999
Don't deny me this chance
to fulfil that duty.

935
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,167
Please.

936
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:08,792
Go!

937
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,457
- Give the Guru my regards.

938
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:29,916
- May the Light of the Brahmāstra...

939
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:32,417
- always watch over you both!

940
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,375
He wants to fight.

941
01:13:58,417 --> 01:13:59,583
What happened, Shiva?

942
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:02,917
"Sahasra Nandim Samarthyam"

943
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,250
"O Nandi Astram!"

944
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:10,417
Crush him so hard...

945
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,500
"Khand Khand Kuru"

946
01:14:13,292 --> 01:14:15,624
That the pieces of the Brahmāstra
are lost within pieces of him!

947
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:18,042
"Mam Sahayakam"

948
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:20,625
"Mam Sahayakam"

949
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,042
Drive!

950
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,667
SHIVA!

951
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:52,916
Shiva, we're going to crash!
What are you doing?

952
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:53,666
- Stop the car!

953
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:54,833
- SHIVA!

954
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:04,333
What did you see, Shiva?

955
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,500
Energy.

956
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:08,917
And Sir...

957
01:15:35,833 --> 01:15:36,708
No!

958
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,333
No!

959
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:49,624
No!

960
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,458
Shiva?

961
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:55,375
NO!

962
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:14,042
Get up.

963
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:15,958
- Get up.

964
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,625
Fight.

965
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,500
Stand up.

966
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,042
- Fight back, Sir!

967
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,250
- Kavachāstra (Magic Armour)... Protect!

968
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:59,042
What happened?

969
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:02,708
He's gone...

970
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,833
so are the two killers!

971
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:09,333
Just breathe, Shiva.

972
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,333
I'll drive... okay?

973
01:17:15,167 --> 01:17:17,416
Two killers so then...

974
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:18,792
the third?

975
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,417
Go go go!

976
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:36,458
Go go go! Faster!

977
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,792
Go go go!

978
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:50,042
Faster!

979
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,833
Where'd he go?

980
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:26,583
Shiva!

981
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:28,458
Shiva!

982
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:32,625
Shiva!

983
01:18:33,417 --> 01:18:34,292
Shiva!

984
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:37,833
Shiva!

985
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:41,917
- Let go! Let go of me!

986
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:43,708
- Shiva!

987
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:46,125
Shiva!

988
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:48,042
Shiva!

989
01:18:49,042 --> 01:18:50,082
Isha, I won't let anything happen to you!

990
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:50,958
- Let go!

991
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:51,792
- Shiva!

992
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:53,875
- Let go of me!

993
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:55,042
No!

994
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Shiva!

995
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:30,249
It's not far now.

996
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,125
There is a dirt road ahead.

997
01:19:41,292 --> 01:19:42,042
Shiva!

998
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:53,542
He's got a gun, Shiva!

999
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:04,917
Shiva, look out!

1000
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,250
He's just not dying!

1001
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:49,250
- C'mon, Isha!

1002
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:50,958
I do too...

1003
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:52,625
What?

1004
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,042
You said...

1005
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:57,458
you love me.

1006
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:04,625
I do too.

1007
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:14,042
Say it.

1008
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:19,083
I love you, Shiva.

1009
01:22:22,375 --> 01:22:23,708
I love you, Isha!

1010
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:33,666
No!

1011
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:36,042
The Brahmāstra belongs to Him!

1012
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:39,167
NO!

1013
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:05,917
Shiva!

1014
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:25,083
Shiva!

1015
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,042
Shiva!

1016
01:23:30,917 --> 01:23:31,958
Shiva!

1017
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,167
- Shiva...

1018
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:35,207
Guruji, Shiva's in pain.

1019
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,999
The whole day has gone by,
why is he still asleep?

1020
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,374
He's sleeping...

1021
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:42,417
because within him
a Great Power is waking up.

1022
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,167
Master of Astras.

1023
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,375
O Supreme One.

1024
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,792
We have lost one of our Comrades.

1025
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,416
The Guru's identity...

1026
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:23,500
- and the location of his Ashram,
are still unknown to me.

1027
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:26,917
There is something else...

1028
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:30,875
there is a boy,
who is interfering in our cause.

1029
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,583
We will find out more about him.

1030
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,375
I will resume my mission
for the last Two Pieces...

1031
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:44,874
I will keep fighting...

1032
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:47,708
but I need your Power!

1033
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:54,666
Help me!

1034
01:26:54,667 --> 01:26:57,542
So that I can fulfil my life's purpose...

1035
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,375
and bring you back to life!

1036
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,582
Help me!

1037
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:07,583
So that I can attain
the Brahmāstra for you!

1038
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:33,458
HAIL BRAHMĀSTRA!

1039
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:07,958
In my time...

1040
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:14,083
there has been only one Emergency
Meeting of the Brahmānsh High Council.

1041
01:28:14,833 --> 01:28:16,750
Today is the second!

1042
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:20,041
The Brahmānsh is in danger.

1043
01:28:20,042 --> 01:28:24,000
Two of our senior members,
Mohan and Anish have passed away.

1044
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,333
But these were no ordinary deaths...

1045
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:27,708
they were murdered.

1046
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,042
What?

1047
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,917
Those Assassins have
stolen the Vānarāstra...

1048
01:28:33,292 --> 01:28:35,000
and the Nandi Astra.

1049
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:39,042
And also... one piece of the Brahmāstra.

1050
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,041
But who are these assassins?

1051
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:46,666
And how do they know about us, Raghu?

1052
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:49,250
We have no information at this time...

1053
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:53,124
but the position of the stars tells us...

1054
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:55,000
there is some great secret...

1055
01:28:56,042 --> 01:28:58,292
behind these events.

1056
01:28:58,542 --> 01:28:59,832
- So what do we do now, Guruji?

1057
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:00,792
Now we must-

1058
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,791
Now we must search for answers.

1059
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,250
Stay alert...

1060
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:10,374
and warn all our members.

1061
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,833
- Let us say a Prayer before we depart.

1062
01:29:28,625 --> 01:29:30,166
- Where are you taking me?

1063
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:32,542
- Who goes boating on a mountain?

1064
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:34,333
You just come here.

1065
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:38,125
If this is the reaction
I get for fainting...

1066
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:41,624
I should do it more often.

1067
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:45,167
I thought it was all over at the gate.

1068
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,417
You saved us, Shiva! Thank God!

1069
01:29:52,292 --> 01:29:53,667
Enough of this drama.

1070
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:55,875
Let’s get out of here, Isha.

1071
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,791
I know it's a viewpoint,
but is the PDA necessary?

1072
01:29:58,792 --> 01:30:00,957
They've made our viewpoint
a lover's point.

1073
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:04,125
- Awake all of 5 minutes, and already at it!
- Move, Romeo!

1074
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:08,207
- Mom's calling...
- Are you planning to talk to her from my lap?

1075
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:10,875
Bro, we only get phone network on the boat.

1076
01:30:11,125 --> 01:30:12,374
By the way, I'm Sher!

1077
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:13,999
Guys, this is Shiva...

1078
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and Shiva, this is Raveena,
Rani and this is little Tensing!

1079
01:30:18,042 --> 01:30:19,791
- Who are these people?
- Us?

1080
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:22,042
We're the Avengers of this Institute!

1081
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,582
They're new members of the Brahmānsh...

1082
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:26,166
here to learn under the Guru.

1083
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:28,624
If we're done with the small talk,
go meet the Guru.

1084
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,542
He's expecting you.

1085
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:41,583
Namaste, Sir.

1086
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,207
Sir, if I can be honest...

1087
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:48,583
when I heard ‘Guru', I imagined someone
in long robes with tangled hair!

1088
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,916
But you're a total rockstar!

1089
01:30:51,917 --> 01:30:55,416
A man's identity is not known
by his outward appearance...

1090
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,583
but by the Energy inside him!

1091
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:02,082
Like you... on the outside,
you're an ordinary young man...

1092
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,750
but inside of you, hides a powerful warrior!

1093
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:08,667
Warrior?

1094
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:10,374
Me?!

1095
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:12,333
Stop mocking me, Sir!

1096
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,957
Outside... those Senior Citizens of yours...

1097
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:17,000
they are Warriors!

1098
01:31:17,042 --> 01:31:17,999
Shiva?

1099
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,458
- Sir, may I?
- Yes.

1100
01:31:20,292 --> 01:31:22,582
But the Astras they all had...

1101
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:24,374
My mind is blown, Sir!

1102
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:27,000
Anything could be an Astra here...

1103
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:28,542
like this knife.

1104
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:31,250
Used to cut fruits or slay demons?

1105
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:33,917
Hmm...

1106
01:31:35,042 --> 01:31:36,208
Astra...

1107
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,792
like you, Shiva!

1108
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:46,000
We, the Brahmānsh...

1109
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:48,375
protect powerful Astras...

1110
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:51,333
- but you are an Astra yourself.

1111
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:53,917
Agnyastra (Fire Astra)!

1112
01:31:56,167 --> 01:31:59,291
According to Isha, if I ask you to...

1113
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:03,707
you can't even light
a candle with your Fire...

1114
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:08,250
and yet yesterday at my gate,
you burnt that Assassin to ashes!

1115
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:12,375
Now, if I tell you that
this is just the start.

1116
01:32:13,417 --> 01:32:15,041
That one day...

1117
01:32:15,042 --> 01:32:18,875
with just a small flame, you can burn
a whole building to the ground.

1118
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:20,792
What will you say?

1119
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,042
I'd tell you to lay off the drugs, Sir!

1120
01:32:25,667 --> 01:32:28,624
Join the Brahmānsh, Shiva...

1121
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:31,166
and I'll transform you...

1122
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:33,125
from a DJ into a Dragon!

1123
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,041
- You were right.

1124
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:40,583
This is an Astra.

1125
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:41,875
My...

1126
01:32:42,458 --> 01:32:44,125
Prabhāstra (Sword of Light)!

1127
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,916
- Comes in very handy...

1128
01:32:45,917 --> 01:32:47,042
Just like...

1129
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:48,708
a pocket-knife.

1130
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,124
Sir, you're offering a membership
to the Brahmānsh...

1131
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:57,832
like it's a Diwali Shopping Sale,
that one obviously says Yes to!

1132
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:01,250
But I've got to break your heart
because my answer is...

1133
01:33:03,292 --> 01:33:04,292
no!

1134
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:05,667
I see.

1135
01:33:05,958 --> 01:33:07,708
Sir, you're right.

1136
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:10,375
I do have a weird connection with Fire.

1137
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:12,791
But this Fire Power...

1138
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:13,707
I don't want it.

1139
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:17,457
- But why, Shiva?
- Because you're in my life, Isha.

1140
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:20,541
And THIS Power between us...

1141
01:33:20,542 --> 01:33:22,000
is enough for me.

1142
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:25,499
What did you call me, Sir?

1143
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,167
An ordinary man.

1144
01:33:27,792 --> 01:33:31,042
There's Power in leading
an ordinary life too... Light in it!

1145
01:33:31,792 --> 01:33:33,708
And this Battle of yours...

1146
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:36,791
It's Dark, Sir.
I don't want to get stuck in it.

1147
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:38,917
But you are already stuck, Shiva...

1148
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:42,042
in our DARK Battle.

1149
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:46,624
Have you ever wondered about your visions.
Why ONLY you get them?

1150
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:49,166
Why did your life bring you here?

1151
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:51,583
Why you were given this Boon of Fire?

1152
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:55,958
Because the Brahmānsh is in your destiny.

1153
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:58,542
In this, there is no doubt.

1154
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,083
And you have no choice!

1155
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:03,875
You're crossing a line, Sir.

1156
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:06,749
Any person, at any given moment...

1157
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,458
always has a choice in
what they do with their lives.

1158
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:13,499
And this Battle for the Brahmāstra...

1159
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,124
is not mine, and I won't fight it!

1160
01:34:16,125 --> 01:34:17,583
That's my final choice!

1161
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:19,375
- Shiva...
- Let's go!

1162
01:34:19,417 --> 01:34:22,292
The Battle for the Brahmāstra
was your Parents' Battle!

1163
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:26,999
Your parents were...

1164
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Warriors of the Brahmānsh!

1165
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,583
What?!

1166
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:38,707
Everything is connected, Shiva...

1167
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:40,832
you are not understanding, Shiva.

1168
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:44,833
You are connected to us
because your Parents were connected to us!

1169
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:49,500
The Brahmānsh is in your blood!

1170
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:53,832
And if you leave today,
you will never learn anything about them!

1171
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:56,000
You will remain an Orphan forever!

1172
01:34:56,292 --> 01:34:59,083
That's the choice you are making!
Remember that!

1173
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:02,667
You tell me clearly everything
you know about my parents!

1174
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:04,083
I won't tell you anything!

1175
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:10,875
I won't tell you until you become worthy
of hearing their story.

1176
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,249
And there's only one way to do that.

1177
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,375
What?

1178
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,916
Stay here, Shiva.

1179
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:17,166
Stay here.

1180
01:35:17,167 --> 01:35:20,042
And ignite your inner Fire!

1181
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:25,207
You're blackmailing me, Sir!

1182
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:28,500
I will do anything
to protect the Brahmāstra!

1183
01:35:28,708 --> 01:35:32,916
I have only one connection
to the intentions of these Assassins...

1184
01:35:32,917 --> 01:35:33,917
You!

1185
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:37,042
So you have to stay here.

1186
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,583
And I can see in your eyes...

1187
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:44,000
that your choice is changing!

1188
01:35:47,333 --> 01:35:49,500
Isha will have to leave...

1189
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:52,332
with the Senior Citizens of the Brahmānsh.

1190
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:54,957
She'll be back in a few days
with your things.

1191
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,792
You'll have very little time
so say your goodbyes.

1192
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:08,875
Guruji has me trapped.

1193
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,541
Well, that's why he's the Guru!

1194
01:36:12,542 --> 01:36:15,083
I'll finally learn
about my parents here, Isha.

1195
01:36:18,208 --> 01:36:20,708
Will you be okay without me?

1196
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:23,250
No.

1197
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:27,583
But at least you'll be safe,
away from me.

1198
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,167
Why didn't you tell me?

1199
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:41,042
I knew you'd feel bad.

1200
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:44,500
Got yourself burnt by my love.

1201
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:48,083
Since a while.

1202
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:54,292
Fire destroys everything, Isha.

1203
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:59,000
It also illuminates everything.

1204
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:02,333
My Warrior of Light!

1205
01:37:33,458 --> 01:37:36,166
Tell me again about your visions?

1206
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:37,958
For the last time, Raghu Sir.

1207
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:39,666
There's a killer, Zor.

1208
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,250
- And another... Junoon.

1209
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:44,999
And they want The Brahmāstra!

1210
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,583
But we don't know why?

1211
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:50,458
Oh, and... Junoon has a stone.

1212
01:37:50,917 --> 01:37:52,375
Like coal...

1213
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:53,707
broken...

1214
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,875
- and that stone has power.

1215
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,917
Can you remember anything else?

1216
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,958
There's one more thing...

1217
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:04,916
it's not really clear in my visions, but...

1218
01:38:04,917 --> 01:38:07,458
I think Junoon has a Guru, too!

1219
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:10,292
Anything else?

1220
01:38:10,542 --> 01:38:11,999
Nothing else, Sir!

1221
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,582
It's hard enough to
remember even this much.

1222
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:15,957
Come on, Santha...

1223
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:17,500
let's end today's investigation.

1224
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:19,082
Please also note in my statement...

1225
01:38:19,083 --> 01:38:21,916
that Junoon is looking for you
and she's deadly!

1226
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:23,667
So please be careful!

1227
01:38:25,083 --> 01:38:28,582
Even if Junoon finds us,
she doesn't know...

1228
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:31,458
that I have a new Astra...

1229
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:34,083
who's far more deadly than her.

1230
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:36,124
Agnyastra (A Fire Stone)!

1231
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:38,375
But at the moment... he's OFF!

1232
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:41,125
So Dragon...

1233
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:43,458
Time to come ON!

1234
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:44,999
What does that mean?

1235
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,374
Here.

1236
01:38:46,375 --> 01:38:48,207
This is the Āyur-Mudrika (Ring of Healing).

1237
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:50,667
It can heal these dying plants.

1238
01:38:51,417 --> 01:38:52,583
Try it!

1239
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:56,750
Nag-Dhanush (Snake Bow) - Awaken!

1240
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:03,917
Rani, you try.

1241
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:12,042
Woah... It came ON!

1242
01:39:15,875 --> 01:39:18,250
Gajāstra (Elephant Shield) - Protect!

1243
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:21,042
For any Astra to come ON...

1244
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,708
first, the wielder needs to come ON...

1245
01:39:28,292 --> 01:39:29,583
from within!

1246
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:32,167
That went way over my head, Sir.

1247
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,917
So, Dragon...

1248
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:43,542
You have to switch from OFF to ON.

1249
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:44,708
How?

1250
01:39:44,833 --> 01:39:46,083
Simple.

1251
01:39:46,667 --> 01:39:48,124
By finding your button.

1252
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:49,333
- Button?
- Yes!

1253
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,333
- Is he high?
- Come on, Shiva.

1254
01:39:52,583 --> 01:39:54,000
Increase this fire.

1255
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:56,917
So what's your button, Sir?

1256
01:40:21,917 --> 01:40:25,083
- Come, Tensing!
Activate the Pawanāstra (Air Stone)!

1257
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:44,208
It's just not happening, Sir.

1258
01:41:09,542 --> 01:41:11,000
Amrita...

1259
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:15,542
Dev...

1260
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:13,333
Isha...

1261
01:42:16,042 --> 01:42:17,458
- Isha...

1262
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:50,666
Tell me where the Ashram is...

1263
01:42:50,667 --> 01:42:52,708
and I'll spare your life!

1264
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:55,249
I'm not afraid of you...

1265
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,292
Zor!

1266
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:28,833
Nandi Astra!

1267
01:44:02,250 --> 01:44:03,250
ISHA!

1268
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:18,749
- Shiva!

1269
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:20,750
Isha, are you okay?

1270
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:23,500
Shiva, how did you know?

1271
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:27,167
Are you okay or not?!

1272
01:44:29,042 --> 01:44:30,167
I'm a bit hurt...

1273
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,750
- but... I'm okay, Shiva!

1274
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:35,333
- I'm fine... I'm okay.

1275
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:40,375
Thank God you're okay, Isha!

1276
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:44,250
- Shiva!

1277
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,292
- Shiva!

1278
01:44:48,417 --> 01:44:50,542
Thank God you're okay!

1279
01:44:51,167 --> 01:44:53,083
Aye, Shiva...

1280
01:44:54,208 --> 01:44:55,250
- I'm okay.

1281
01:44:55,917 --> 01:44:57,000
I love you.

1282
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,125
I love you, Isha!

1283
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:05,042
I love you, Shiva!

1284
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:06,124
Hello?

1285
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:07,166
Shiva?

1286
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:07,957
Hello?

1287
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:08,750
Hello, Isha?

1288
01:45:09,417 --> 01:45:10,832
Your voice is breaking... hello?

1289
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:11,667
- Isha!

1290
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,832
- I've spoken to my people...

1291
01:45:51,833 --> 01:45:53,083
Isha is fine.

1292
01:45:53,625 --> 01:45:55,042
She's coming here.

1293
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,333
Shiva, tell me what's on your mind...
what's the problem?

1294
01:46:00,958 --> 01:46:01,833
Isha...

1295
01:46:02,250 --> 01:46:03,749
how do I explain?

1296
01:46:03,750 --> 01:46:05,042
Look, Shiva...

1297
01:46:07,542 --> 01:46:09,542
most people fall in love...

1298
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:14,000
but very few people fall so deeply in love.

1299
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,500
I love Isha very deeply, Sir.

1300
01:46:16,667 --> 01:46:17,500
But...

1301
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:18,875
Isha is my button!

1302
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:21,042
If you knew this, why didn't you tell me?

1303
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:23,083
Because when this button is ON...

1304
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:27,000
You become the Agnyastra (Fire Astra)!

1305
01:46:34,042 --> 01:46:37,042
And fire destroys everything, Sir.

1306
01:46:37,542 --> 01:46:39,042
Why are you fighting your fire?

1307
01:46:47,875 --> 01:46:51,042
Fire took my mother from me, Sir.

1308
01:46:55,333 --> 01:46:57,750
You say you knew her, right?

1309
01:46:58,208 --> 01:47:00,583
She was burnt to ashes by fire.

1310
01:47:04,542 --> 01:47:06,708
Those memories will always haunt me...

1311
01:47:07,042 --> 01:47:10,083
those nightmares will never stop.

1312
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:13,917
You say I'm the Agnyastra.

1313
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:17,583
Could it be that...

1314
01:47:18,875 --> 01:47:21,167
my fire took my mother's life?

1315
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:25,625
And that's why...

1316
01:47:26,542 --> 01:47:28,458
you hate fire.

1317
01:47:30,167 --> 01:47:31,583
No sir...

1318
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:34,042
I'm scared of it...

1319
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:38,000
very scared of fire...

1320
01:47:38,583 --> 01:47:40,667
and that's why I always run from it.

1321
01:47:51,917 --> 01:47:53,667
That’s how life is, Shiva...

1322
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:57,249
it doesn’t work around our fears...

1323
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:58,708
it brings our fears to us!

1324
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:00,542
And so life...

1325
01:48:01,083 --> 01:48:02,750
brought Isha to you!

1326
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:05,792
Isha.

1327
01:48:07,125 --> 01:48:08,208
Sir...

1328
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:11,542
my life has been beautiful...

1329
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:15,000
but it's been lonely.

1330
01:48:17,042 --> 01:48:19,167
Maybe if I had my mother...

1331
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:21,750
it would have been different.

1332
01:48:24,292 --> 01:48:26,000
Now I have Isha...

1333
01:48:27,875 --> 01:48:29,250
and I'm not alone.

1334
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:33,750
Before her, I was incomplete...

1335
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:36,542
now, I'm whole.

1336
01:48:42,292 --> 01:48:43,167
Look...

1337
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:44,667
the Power of Love!

1338
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,708
A Power that...

1339
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,792
like my mother...

1340
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:54,000
could burn Isha.

1341
01:48:58,792 --> 01:48:59,958
And look...

1342
01:49:01,667 --> 01:49:03,458
the Strength of Fear.

1343
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,792
I understand your situation, Shiva.

1344
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:10,125
Isha is love.

1345
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:13,750
Love connects you to fire.

1346
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:15,292
But fire...

1347
01:49:17,542 --> 01:49:19,458
is your biggest fear!

1348
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:21,833
What will you choose?

1349
01:49:22,583 --> 01:49:23,582
Love?

1350
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:24,375
Or Fear?

1351
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,875
I've already chosen love, Sir.

1352
01:49:29,667 --> 01:49:31,792
Then you must accept your fear!

1353
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:36,375
And give your fear...

1354
01:49:37,167 --> 01:49:38,417
Love.

1355
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:45,042
Isha is just the path...

1356
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:46,750
but your button...

1357
01:49:47,292 --> 01:49:48,375
is Love.

1358
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,750
Shiva, I don't know
what happened to your mother.

1359
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:55,167
But I do know that...

1360
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:59,166
the Fire of Love cannot destroy anything.

1361
01:49:59,167 --> 01:50:01,166
A fire like that...

1362
01:50:01,167 --> 01:50:03,250
can light up the whole world!

1363
01:50:04,208 --> 01:50:10,792
And no one has the right
to cage something so pure, Shiva.

1364
01:50:20,125 --> 01:50:22,291
Respect it...

1365
01:50:22,292 --> 01:50:24,000
be grateful for it...

1366
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,208
because love...

1367
01:50:28,792 --> 01:50:32,375
Is the most powerful thing in this world!

1368
01:50:42,167 --> 01:50:43,583
Wow!

1369
01:50:43,958 --> 01:50:44,917
Fantastic!

1370
01:55:36,583 --> 01:55:39,166
I can't make fire without a flame, Sir.

1371
01:55:39,167 --> 01:55:43,167
The right time comes at it's own time.

1372
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:48,167
Sir, when will the time be right...

1373
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:51,582
for you to tell me my parents story?

1374
01:55:51,583 --> 01:55:54,792
I've been carrying around this question
my whole life, Sir.

1375
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,917
Ashram!

1376
01:56:21,875 --> 01:56:24,250
- Guruji, what happened there?

1377
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:27,958
He was looking for the Ashram.

1378
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,708
We should search this area carefully.

1379
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:37,291
Sir, that was one of Junoon's men.

1380
01:56:37,292 --> 01:56:39,500
His pendant...

1381
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:41,500
I've seen it.

1382
01:56:41,792 --> 01:56:42,832
Sir...?

1383
01:56:42,833 --> 01:56:44,833
That Black Pendant...

1384
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:47,583
had glimmers of the Agnyastra in it.

1385
01:56:48,042 --> 01:56:49,000
Agnyastra?

1386
01:56:57,583 --> 01:57:00,333
Shiva, it is time to tell you the story!

1387
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:01,917
Come.

1388
01:57:05,333 --> 01:57:06,875
- Māyāstra (Astra of Concealment)

1389
01:57:08,375 --> 01:57:11,792
- which reveals its true form,
only with its master's blood.

1390
01:57:12,542 --> 01:57:14,416
- This story begins with...

1391
01:57:14,417 --> 01:57:16,292
the Lord of all the Astras.

1392
01:57:18,333 --> 01:57:19,624
Is this...?

1393
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:22,000
A piece of the Brahmāstra!

1394
01:57:23,208 --> 01:57:26,125
Didn't I bring this piece from the Artist?

1395
01:57:30,583 --> 01:57:32,250
The Second Piece.

1396
01:57:33,208 --> 01:57:34,417
- Three Pieces...

1397
01:57:34,958 --> 01:57:38,291
- you all know that...
there are three pieces of the Brahmāstra...

1398
01:57:38,292 --> 01:57:39,042
- But...

1399
01:57:39,542 --> 01:57:41,999
about thirty years ago...

1400
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,541
when I was just a young student
of the Brahmānsh.

1401
01:57:44,542 --> 01:57:48,499
- The Headquarters of the Brahmānsh...
was in the seas, on an island.

1402
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,999
- Back then, the Brahmāstra
wasn't in three pieces.

1403
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,583
- It was whole.

1404
01:57:54,792 --> 01:57:55,750
- And...

1405
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:58,292
He was there, too...

1406
01:58:01,917 --> 01:58:03,542
a young warrior...

1407
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:08,792
Dev!

1408
01:58:17,292 --> 01:58:20,624
- Dev was very powerful.
Different from everyone.

1409
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:23,582
- He had a fierce obsession
with all the Astras.

1410
01:58:23,583 --> 01:58:26,124
- He could make the impossible, possible.

1411
01:58:26,125 --> 01:58:29,416
- He mastered not one... but many Astras.

1412
01:58:29,417 --> 01:58:31,291
- But the Astra he became
the King of was...

1413
01:58:31,292 --> 01:58:33,208
The Agnyastra (Fire Astra)!

1414
01:58:36,833 --> 01:58:39,541
- When Dev unleashed
the power of the Agnyastra...

1415
01:58:39,542 --> 01:58:44,125
- all the other magic of the Brahmānsh
paled in front of his Fire.

1416
01:58:45,208 --> 01:58:48,417
People used to call him...
Agni Dev (Fire Lord).

1417
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,041
- He was already Jal Dev (Water Lord).
Kavach (Armour) and Gyaan (Knowledge) Dev!

1418
01:58:53,042 --> 01:58:55,624
- but eventually he wanted to be...

1419
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,125
- Brahm-Dev!

1420
01:58:58,042 --> 01:58:59,957
Meaning he wanted...

1421
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:01,458
the Brahmāstra!

1422
01:59:02,833 --> 01:59:06,124
- Keeping the Brahmāstra calm
is the duty of the Brahmānsh.

1423
01:59:06,125 --> 01:59:08,667
- Dev didn't care about this.

1424
01:59:09,042 --> 01:59:11,792
- He defeated the Council members...

1425
01:59:12,083 --> 01:59:14,042
- and stole the Brahmāstra.

1426
01:59:15,083 --> 01:59:16,333
- And then...

1427
01:59:17,625 --> 01:59:19,332
for the first time in this age...

1428
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:21,583
the Brahmāstra woke up.

1429
01:59:26,542 --> 01:59:27,666
- Then...

1430
01:59:27,667 --> 01:59:31,124
- appeared an extraordinary
and terrible sight.

1431
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:32,957
- The earth, the ocean...

1432
01:59:32,958 --> 01:59:35,292
- and the heavens came alive.

1433
01:59:35,792 --> 01:59:37,499
- That day I understood...

1434
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,625
- what Brahmāstra truly is!

1435
01:59:41,542 --> 01:59:46,750
- Dev would have willingly destroyed
the world with his greed for the Brahmāstra.

1436
01:59:49,125 --> 01:59:51,791
This village looks empty.

1437
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:53,374
Did Dev succeed?

1438
01:59:53,375 --> 01:59:54,167
Sir?

1439
01:59:54,750 --> 01:59:55,667
Did Dev win?

1440
01:59:57,583 --> 01:59:58,999
No, Son...

1441
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,375
we haven't gotten to the real Battle yet!

1442
02:00:02,083 --> 02:00:05,624
This story has another player.

1443
02:00:05,625 --> 02:00:07,249
- Our Ace of Spades!

1444
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:10,249
- Who fought Dev in the Last Battle
for the Brahmāstra...

1445
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:13,749
- and by breaking the Brahmāstra
into three pieces...

1446
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:15,792
defeated Dev and destroyed Dev's fire!

1447
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:18,207
Who was he?

1448
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:19,250
She.

1449
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,542
- A beautiful...

1450
02:00:27,333 --> 02:00:28,958
- and pure Energy!

1451
02:00:31,292 --> 02:00:32,333
Amrita.

1452
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:35,624
I've seen her name on your boat.

1453
02:00:35,625 --> 02:00:36,833
Not mine...

1454
02:00:37,208 --> 02:00:38,707
- Amrita's boat.

1455
02:00:38,708 --> 02:00:40,999
- Which was the only survivor
of that Battle.

1456
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,791
- The boat returned to us
with the pieces of the Brahmāstra...

1457
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:46,042
- but there were only two.

1458
02:00:46,417 --> 02:00:49,624
But the Brahmāstra is in three pieces?

1459
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:52,749
In the Last Battle for the Brahmāstra...

1460
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:54,082
that Third Piece was lost!

1461
02:00:54,083 --> 02:00:55,000
- WHAT?!

1462
02:00:55,833 --> 02:00:58,124
You mean the Brahmāstra is incomplete?

1463
02:00:58,125 --> 02:01:00,791
What happened to Dev and Amrita?

1464
02:01:00,792 --> 02:01:06,375
The island where all this took place,
was swallowed by the ocean...

1465
02:01:07,208 --> 02:01:09,083
And with that, the two of them, too.

1466
02:01:09,875 --> 02:01:12,833
- That's what we all believe...

1467
02:01:13,417 --> 02:01:15,167
- but don't truly know.

1468
02:01:16,667 --> 02:01:17,583
Sir...

1469
02:01:18,042 --> 02:01:21,042
you were going to tell me
the story of my parents.

1470
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:25,332
But this story is about
Dev and Amrita's battle!

1471
02:01:25,333 --> 02:01:26,625
So...

1472
02:01:27,125 --> 02:01:28,333
then... how?

1473
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:33,917
Before the Battle, what was
Dev and Amrita's relationship?

1474
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:38,667
One of Love.

1475
02:01:43,958 --> 02:01:45,249
Yes, Shiva.

1476
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:47,541
The last battle for the Brahmāstra...

1477
02:01:47,542 --> 02:01:49,250
- is also the story of two lovers.

1478
02:01:50,625 --> 02:01:53,749
Dev fought for his passion...

1479
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:55,916
- and Amrita, for her duty.

1480
02:01:55,917 --> 02:01:58,667
But by the time the Battle happened...

1481
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,167
Amrita was pregnant.

1482
02:02:09,583 --> 02:02:11,416
- Thirty years passed...

1483
02:02:11,417 --> 02:02:12,625
- then...

1484
02:02:12,917 --> 02:02:14,249
- suddenly, you appeared before me.

1485
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:16,874
- And I saw a reflection
of Dev's fire in yours...

1486
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:18,500
- and in you, a glimmer of Dev!

1487
02:02:19,042 --> 02:02:21,124
Is it possible that in that Battle...

1488
02:02:21,125 --> 02:02:23,249
Amrita... survived, somehow.

1489
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:25,875
- And Amrita's child was born.

1490
02:02:26,333 --> 02:02:27,999
- And that child...

1491
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,042
Is me?

1492
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:39,250
Sir, you don't have any proof of all this?

1493
02:02:40,917 --> 02:02:42,916
Everything is connected, Shiva.

1494
02:02:42,917 --> 02:02:44,292
Everything-

1495
02:02:52,208 --> 02:02:53,874
By fire!

1496
02:02:53,875 --> 02:02:54,958
Yes, Shiva...

1497
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:56,791
we'll talk about this later now.

1498
02:02:56,792 --> 02:02:57,707
Guruji!

1499
02:02:57,708 --> 02:02:59,292
- I found this!

1500
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:03,041
That man was from this village then!

1501
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:05,374
But where have all the villagers gone?

1502
02:03:05,375 --> 02:03:06,624
Let's go!

1503
02:03:06,625 --> 02:03:09,332
- The Black pendant had glimmers
of the Agnyastra in it.

1504
02:03:09,333 --> 02:03:10,375
Shiva.

1505
02:03:10,958 --> 02:03:12,292
Let's go.

1506
02:03:12,917 --> 02:03:13,750
- Dev...

1507
02:03:14,417 --> 02:03:15,582
- Amrita...

1508
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:17,083
- Dev's fire...

1509
02:03:17,583 --> 02:03:18,832
- My fire...

1510
02:03:18,833 --> 02:03:20,207
- Agnyastra...

1511
02:03:20,208 --> 02:03:21,000
Shiva!

1512
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,124
- The ocean swallowed the island.

1513
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:25,582
- But in the end he wanted to be...

1514
02:03:25,583 --> 02:03:26,166
Come on, Shiva!

1515
02:03:26,167 --> 02:03:27,082
- Brahm-Dev!

1516
02:03:27,083 --> 02:03:27,832
- Who?

1517
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:29,749
- But in the end he wanted to be...

1518
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:30,582
- Brahm-Dev!

1519
02:03:30,583 --> 02:03:31,875
- Who?

1520
02:03:47,583 --> 02:03:49,417
- Welcome!

1521
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:53,958
Welcome to our Army!

1522
02:03:54,667 --> 02:03:55,625
Junoon.

1523
02:03:56,583 --> 02:03:58,582
- You are not farmers any more...

1524
02:03:58,583 --> 02:04:01,667
- but soldiers of a great cause.

1525
02:04:03,917 --> 02:04:08,292
- What we are seeking,
is what you all must seek now!

1526
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:12,957
And for that end, we must find
the headquarters of the Brahmānsh first!

1527
02:04:12,958 --> 02:04:16,792
Some strong power resides...

1528
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:20,000
in that pendant.

1529
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,708
How is the hunt for the Ashram progressing?

1530
02:04:23,875 --> 02:04:28,166
These Himalayan ranges have many towns,
many villages, and many houses.

1531
02:04:28,167 --> 02:04:29,916
It's only been a few days.
We need more time.

1532
02:04:29,917 --> 02:04:31,125
Seven days!

1533
02:04:31,708 --> 02:04:34,041
I give you all seven days.

1534
02:04:34,042 --> 02:04:37,207
- We will attack as soon as
we find the Ashram.

1535
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:38,583
And remember...

1536
02:04:39,625 --> 02:04:43,166
this power you are
all feeling within you...

1537
02:04:43,167 --> 02:04:45,667
it is the greatest power of all.

1538
02:04:46,875 --> 02:04:49,917
And it has only one purpose...

1539
02:04:50,625 --> 02:04:53,000
BRAHMĀSTRA!

1540
02:04:59,042 --> 02:05:00,000
- Who?

1541
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:01,875
- Who?

1542
02:05:15,417 --> 02:05:16,667
- Who?

1543
02:05:36,958 --> 02:05:38,292
- Who?

1544
02:05:39,708 --> 02:05:40,917
- Who?

1545
02:05:42,667 --> 02:05:44,000
- Who?

1546
02:06:01,958 --> 02:06:03,625
Something's happened to her.

1547
02:06:05,083 --> 02:06:06,000
Shiva!

1548
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:07,083
Shiva!

1549
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,583
- She knows we're here!

1550
02:06:21,125 --> 02:06:22,292
Guruji!

1551
02:06:34,042 --> 02:06:36,042
Move back!

1552
02:06:51,083 --> 02:06:54,708
The headquarters of the Brahmānsh
is no longer secure.

1553
02:06:55,208 --> 02:06:59,249
We have to leave from here
before they find us.

1554
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:01,500
I'll make some arrangements.

1555
02:07:01,542 --> 02:07:03,166
- I made a mistake...

1556
02:07:03,167 --> 02:07:05,416
- While I was thinking about
our next move...

1557
02:07:05,417 --> 02:07:07,583
- their power grew too strong.

1558
02:07:12,417 --> 02:07:13,833
Namaste!

1559
02:07:31,875 --> 02:07:33,666
Weren't you hurt?

1560
02:07:33,667 --> 02:07:35,332
All better, thanks to Dr. Rani.

1561
02:07:35,333 --> 02:07:38,250
Just making sure you guys
have no trouble cuddling at night...

1562
02:07:41,417 --> 02:07:47,082
So, Guruji asked me to bring anything
that's related to your mother.

1563
02:07:47,083 --> 02:07:50,124
Has he told you anything
about your mother, Shiva?

1564
02:07:50,125 --> 02:07:52,124
- I've told him everything, Isha.

1565
02:07:52,125 --> 02:07:53,791
And the proof of my story...

1566
02:07:53,792 --> 02:07:55,208
is in Shiva's hands.

1567
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:56,583
How?

1568
02:07:57,042 --> 02:07:58,541
My friend, Amrita...

1569
02:07:58,542 --> 02:08:03,125
had to break the Brahmāstra
in order to stop Dev...

1570
02:08:05,333 --> 02:08:07,500
- and since that day we have believed...

1571
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
that the third piece of the Brahmāstra...

1572
02:08:10,667 --> 02:08:11,875
is lost.

1573
02:08:12,083 --> 02:08:14,874
But you think,
the Third Piece was not lost...

1574
02:08:14,875 --> 02:08:16,082
- it survived.

1575
02:08:16,083 --> 02:08:18,416
- And Amrita kept that Piece with her!

1576
02:08:18,417 --> 02:08:19,792
This conch...

1577
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:22,166
- isn't just a conch is it, Guruji?

1578
02:08:22,167 --> 02:08:23,332
Māyāstra...

1579
02:08:23,333 --> 02:08:26,625
- which reveals its true form,
only with its master's blood.

1580
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,041
And if Amrita and Shiva
have the same blood...

1581
02:08:34,042 --> 02:08:36,708
- Shiva should be the master
of this Astra, too.

1582
02:08:45,417 --> 02:08:46,792
- Brahmāstra...

1583
02:08:47,917 --> 02:08:49,250
The Third Piece...

1584
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,624
and my proof...

1585
02:08:51,625 --> 02:08:54,333
that you are Amrita's son...

1586
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:55,792
- Shiva!

1587
02:08:57,333 --> 02:08:59,875
Not just Amrita's son, right?

1588
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,750
My father, Dev...

1589
02:09:05,667 --> 02:09:06,999
What about Dev, Sir?

1590
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,750
What do you think?

1591
02:09:09,167 --> 02:09:13,249
In the Last Battle for the Brahmāstra,
my mother was not the only survivor...

1592
02:09:13,250 --> 02:09:14,957
Dev survived, too.

1593
02:09:14,958 --> 02:09:15,750
- What?

1594
02:09:16,625 --> 02:09:20,666
And even today, the force
that still wants the Brahmāstra...

1595
02:09:20,667 --> 02:09:21,333
is Dev.

1596
02:09:21,375 --> 02:09:24,125
- How do you know this, Shiva?
- I just know.

1597
02:09:24,625 --> 02:09:28,291
When I wore the pendant,
I saw a body...

1598
02:09:28,292 --> 02:09:30,208
surrounded by Astras.

1599
02:09:31,625 --> 02:09:33,707
That is Dev.

1600
02:09:33,708 --> 02:09:36,541
Junoon's Guru... is Dev.

1601
02:09:36,542 --> 02:09:39,167
The broken stone Junoon wears...

1602
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:43,749
is the Agnyastra-
which is still connected to Dev...

1603
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:45,292
and also to me.

1604
02:09:46,708 --> 02:09:47,832
Junoon...

1605
02:09:47,833 --> 02:09:48,582
Zor...

1606
02:09:48,583 --> 02:09:50,832
That whole Army is Dev's army.

1607
02:09:50,833 --> 02:09:54,583
From the start,
the presence in my visions...

1608
02:09:54,625 --> 02:09:56,042
that's Dev!

1609
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:01,417
He's not fully alive yet...

1610
02:10:02,750 --> 02:10:04,750
but not quite dead either.

1611
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,208
He's just...

1612
02:10:09,958 --> 02:10:11,042
there.

1613
02:10:11,625 --> 02:10:13,332
- I don't understand any of this.

1614
02:10:13,333 --> 02:10:14,958
I'm so confused.

1615
02:10:15,917 --> 02:10:18,166
But how did Dev survive all this time?

1616
02:10:18,167 --> 02:10:19,832
- And how did he find Junoon?
- Yeah, how?

1617
02:10:19,833 --> 02:10:21,791
How did he build this army?

1618
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:24,582
And Amrita? Why didn't she return
to the Brahmānsh after the Battle?

1619
02:10:24,583 --> 02:10:27,666
- And why did she keep the Third Piece?
- Yes, why?

1620
02:10:27,667 --> 02:10:30,500
This Case is still full of questions...

1621
02:10:32,583 --> 02:10:35,000
that we don't have answers for.

1622
02:10:35,958 --> 02:10:37,125
Aye, Shiva...

1623
02:10:37,625 --> 02:10:39,292
are you okay?

1624
02:10:42,625 --> 02:10:43,750
- Isha...

1625
02:10:44,417 --> 02:10:47,166
- in all of this mess,
I forgot my own theory...

1626
02:10:47,167 --> 02:10:49,124
- when life gets a bit Dark...

1627
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:51,417
- then Shiva... find the Light.

1628
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:56,999
- Of course, my parent's story
is still shrouded in shadows.

1629
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,082
- But for me, there is Light in the fact
that I finally know who they were.

1630
02:11:02,083 --> 02:11:06,208
I will pray for the safety of
all the Astras.

1631
02:11:07,708 --> 02:11:10,417
- And with that, I know who I am.

1632
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:16,957
- This fight is now my fight.

1633
02:11:16,958 --> 02:11:19,208
- And this is now my duty!

1634
02:11:20,875 --> 02:11:25,207
Rani tells me you're making
some really cool fireworks these days...

1635
02:11:25,208 --> 02:11:30,167
but for that you need
to be ON or something.

1636
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:45,582
Now watch...

1637
02:11:45,583 --> 02:11:46,958
Fire Show for you!

1638
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:46,750
Guruji!

1639
02:12:50,375 --> 02:12:51,625
Isha!

1640
02:13:07,042 --> 02:13:08,333
Guruji!

1641
02:13:39,542 --> 02:13:40,917
- Sher...

1642
02:13:48,333 --> 02:13:49,625
- Guruji...

1643
02:13:54,542 --> 02:13:57,624
The ropes that bind us all, Shiva...

1644
02:13:57,625 --> 02:13:59,833
have incredible power in them.

1645
02:14:00,292 --> 02:14:04,416
Only your power can break them now.

1646
02:14:04,417 --> 02:14:07,374
Junoon has joined Two
of the Pieces, Guruji.

1647
02:14:07,375 --> 02:14:09,333
She has taken Rani.

1648
02:14:10,583 --> 02:14:12,041
And she'll keep torturing her until-

1649
02:14:12,042 --> 02:14:15,207
She gets the Third Piece!

1650
02:14:15,208 --> 02:14:17,208
Which is with us.

1651
02:14:23,625 --> 02:14:25,999
We'll give her the Third Piece...

1652
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,291
and save Rani.

1653
02:14:28,292 --> 02:14:30,582
But remember, Shiva...

1654
02:14:30,583 --> 02:14:33,249
If all Three Pieces come together...

1655
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:35,542
the world will be destroyed!

1656
02:14:38,375 --> 02:14:40,833
Have faith in me, Guruji.

1657
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:46,833
Junoon doesn't know
that you have a new Astra...

1658
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,917
that will destroy her!

1659
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
- My...

1660
02:14:54,583 --> 02:14:55,792
Agnyastra!

1661
02:14:57,583 --> 02:14:58,958
- Go, Shiva!

1662
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,875
Unleash your fire!

1663
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:07,917
Zor!

1664
02:15:08,042 --> 02:15:10,292
Take me to Junoon.

1665
02:15:11,833 --> 02:15:13,875
- We have what she wants.

1666
02:15:51,792 --> 02:15:53,291
Thank you.

1667
02:15:53,292 --> 02:15:56,166
You finally led us to the Brahmāstra!

1668
02:15:56,167 --> 02:15:58,832
The moment you wore that Black Pendant...

1669
02:15:58,833 --> 02:16:02,041
we controlled your mind long enough
to get what we needed!

1670
02:16:02,042 --> 02:16:05,000
Your mind is also in
someone else's control, Junoon.

1671
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,208
And it's not you...

1672
02:16:09,625 --> 02:16:11,166
but Him I want to speak to... Dev!

1673
02:16:11,167 --> 02:16:12,667
Brahm-Dev!

1674
02:16:13,333 --> 02:16:15,542
Speak his name with respect!

1675
02:16:19,250 --> 02:16:20,208
Catch!

1676
02:16:33,542 --> 02:16:34,708
Shiva!

1677
02:16:54,750 --> 02:16:57,000
Are we safe, Shiva?

1678
02:17:23,167 --> 02:17:24,916
Isha, why aren't they burning?!

1679
02:17:24,917 --> 02:17:27,749
Because they're wearing
those black pendants.

1680
02:17:27,750 --> 02:17:29,541
Which have the power
of the Agnyastra!

1681
02:17:29,542 --> 02:17:31,207
Dev is protecting them!

1682
02:17:31,208 --> 02:17:33,375
And I'm protecting you.
Don't be scared!

1683
02:18:14,292 --> 02:18:16,125
She's going to do something!

1684
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:32,750
A different Power?

1685
02:18:42,417 --> 02:18:44,000
Water?

1686
02:18:47,542 --> 02:18:48,875
Rain...

1687
02:19:05,542 --> 02:19:08,166
Isha, Lighter!

1688
02:19:08,167 --> 02:19:10,167
Don't let the flame go out!

1689
02:19:37,542 --> 02:19:40,166
You have the power
of the Agnyastra in you!

1690
02:19:40,167 --> 02:19:41,208
- How?

1691
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:43,832
You should join us.

1692
02:19:43,833 --> 02:19:46,625
Brahm-Dev has power
you can't even imagine.

1693
02:19:50,042 --> 02:19:52,708
I don't want the Power of Darkness...

1694
02:19:55,125 --> 02:19:58,333
because I believe only
in the Power of the Light.

1695
02:19:59,917 --> 02:20:02,708
The games end now.

1696
02:20:07,042 --> 02:20:10,375
The game is just beginning!

1697
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:20,708
Destroy them!

1698
02:20:25,583 --> 02:20:27,000
Isha!

1699
02:20:28,667 --> 02:20:29,916
Don't move.

1700
02:20:29,917 --> 02:20:31,292
I'm going to distract them from you.

1701
02:20:31,583 --> 02:20:32,375
Shiva!

1702
02:20:58,583 --> 02:21:00,999
- If all Three Pieces come together...

1703
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,708
- the world will be destroyed!

1704
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,083
Isha!

1705
02:21:11,375 --> 02:21:12,167
Isha!

1706
02:21:13,208 --> 02:21:14,167
Isha!

1707
02:21:16,083 --> 02:21:17,000
Burst!

1708
02:21:25,542 --> 02:21:27,082
Stop firing!

1709
02:21:27,083 --> 02:21:28,875
He must have no fire!

1710
02:21:29,792 --> 02:21:31,708
Come on, Rani! We have to go!

1711
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Shiva!

1712
02:21:40,167 --> 02:21:42,500
Go, Isha! Get out of here!

1713
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,375
Take the Brahmāstra piece and kill him.

1714
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,958
Raveena, catch!

1715
02:23:15,875 --> 02:23:17,500
Guruji!

1716
02:23:40,292 --> 02:23:46,708
- SHIVA!

1717
02:25:10,375 --> 02:25:12,000
Tenzu, stay hidden!

1718
02:25:13,708 --> 02:25:15,042
Tenzu...

1719
02:25:51,333 --> 02:25:52,625
Enough, Junoon!

1720
02:25:53,667 --> 02:25:56,707
Give up this obsession,
or you'll lose your life!

1721
02:25:56,708 --> 02:25:59,541
My life isn't yours to take!

1722
02:25:59,542 --> 02:26:02,000
Because it's not even my own.

1723
02:26:03,208 --> 02:26:06,624
And until I've fulfilled my mission...

1724
02:26:06,625 --> 02:26:08,583
He won't let me die.

1725
02:26:09,375 --> 02:26:11,375
My Lord is resting...

1726
02:26:11,917 --> 02:26:16,292
but you are just a small ember
in front of His Fire!

1727
02:26:18,375 --> 02:26:19,792
Awaken!

1728
02:26:22,625 --> 02:26:24,583
Come to me, Brahm-Dev!

1729
02:26:25,583 --> 02:26:27,624
- Show your Power!

1730
02:26:27,625 --> 02:26:31,250
Set this sleeping Agnyastra ablaze,
Brahm-Dev!

1731
02:26:42,792 --> 02:26:43,833
- Remember...

1732
02:26:44,542 --> 02:26:46,500
- Warrior of Light...

1733
02:26:49,375 --> 02:26:51,999
- there is only one master of Fire!

1734
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,583
- Brahm-Dev!

1735
02:27:02,042 --> 02:27:02,958
Tenzu...

1736
02:27:04,750 --> 02:27:05,542
Run!

1737
02:27:27,833 --> 02:27:31,833
If you come any closer,
I'll throw the Brahmāstra in the valley!

1738
02:27:35,208 --> 02:27:37,750
And the Brahmāstra will be lost again.

1739
02:27:42,292 --> 02:27:43,582
Tenzu, go...

1740
02:27:43,583 --> 02:27:45,292
and don't turn back... okay?

1741
02:27:50,375 --> 02:27:54,624
Now, take the Agnyastra off
and put it on the ground.

1742
02:27:54,625 --> 02:27:56,625
- Or I'll throw this!

1743
02:28:02,167 --> 02:28:04,958
- She won't be able to
throw the Brahmāstra!

1744
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:12,958
BRAHMĀSTRA IS MINE!

1745
02:28:33,250 --> 02:28:36,624
Don't come any closer,
or I'll really throw it!

1746
02:28:36,625 --> 02:28:38,500
Junoon, I'm going to throw it!

1747
02:28:42,250 --> 02:28:44,042
You won't go through with it.

1748
02:28:44,708 --> 02:28:47,333
You're weak and for your weakness,
you will pay the price!

1749
02:29:44,667 --> 02:29:45,667
Yes!

1750
02:30:27,042 --> 02:30:29,375
Tenzing!

1751
02:30:30,583 --> 02:30:32,542
Tenzing!

1752
02:31:27,125 --> 02:31:28,917
Hail Brahm-Dev!

1753
02:32:16,958 --> 02:32:20,000
"Sarva Astra Pradhānam"

1754
02:32:20,792 --> 02:32:23,958
"Srishti Vijayeta Kārakam"

1755
02:32:24,625 --> 02:32:26,625
"Trikhandam Sanyogam"

1756
02:32:27,208 --> 02:32:30,083
"Tatha Prakatam Brahmāstram!"

1757
02:32:31,792 --> 02:32:33,583
It's the Beginning of the End!

1758
02:32:35,542 --> 02:32:37,083
No! Run!

1759
02:32:37,333 --> 02:32:38,542
Isha!

1760
02:32:43,167 --> 02:32:44,917
- Shiva!
- Guruji!

1761
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:46,624
Guruji!

1762
02:32:46,625 --> 02:32:47,708
Shiva!

1763
02:32:51,792 --> 02:32:53,875
You'll die, Shiva!

1764
02:32:54,375 --> 02:32:56,958
Without her I don't want to live!

1765
02:33:05,958 --> 02:33:07,042
Shiva...

1766
02:33:29,583 --> 02:33:31,292
Shiva!

1767
02:33:48,417 --> 02:33:49,417
Shiva!

1768
02:33:52,375 --> 02:33:54,667
Shiva, don't!

1769
02:34:09,250 --> 02:34:11,291
What have you done?

1770
02:34:11,292 --> 02:34:14,375
You could have saved your own life!

1771
02:34:15,333 --> 02:34:17,917
But... YOU are my life!

1772
02:34:18,708 --> 02:34:20,583
Everything is ending!

1773
02:34:21,083 --> 02:34:23,542
We will never end, Isha!

1774
02:34:29,125 --> 02:34:30,292
Light...

1775
02:34:31,250 --> 02:34:33,625
The Light is coming, Shiva!

1776
02:34:34,292 --> 02:34:36,000
From our beginning...

1777
02:34:36,833 --> 02:34:40,167
the Light has been here Isha... in you!

1778
02:34:45,250 --> 02:34:49,083
When we die,
you find me on the other side.

1779
02:34:49,875 --> 02:34:52,625
We are not going to die, Isha.

1780
02:34:53,875 --> 02:34:55,917
And if death must come...

1781
02:34:56,625 --> 02:34:58,375
it will have to take me first!

1782
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,542
I love you, Isha!

1783
02:35:53,333 --> 02:35:54,833
SHIVA!

1784
02:36:36,792 --> 02:36:41,333
<i>And then I witnessed the greatest miracle
I had ever seen.</i>

1785
02:36:45,125 --> 02:36:51,042
<i>The Light of the Brahmāstra
was controlled by Shiva's Fire!</i>

1786
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:06,249
<i>Shiva was ready to
give up his life for Isha...</i>

1787
02:37:06,250 --> 02:37:10,625
<i>And with that act, he showed he was
capable of the highest form of Love...</i>

1788
02:37:11,417 --> 02:37:12,917
<i>sacrifice.</i>

1789
02:37:14,417 --> 02:37:15,957
<i>With that sacrifice...</i>

1790
02:37:15,958 --> 02:37:19,208
<i>Shiva finally created Fire
from within himself...</i>

1791
02:37:19,958 --> 02:37:21,542
<i>a Fire of Love...</i>

1792
02:37:21,792 --> 02:37:27,542
<i>Which calmed the most powerful Astra
in the Universe.</i>

1793
02:37:27,917 --> 02:37:30,582
<i>And I understood,
that in this whole world...</i>

1794
02:37:30,583 --> 02:37:35,333
<i>there is no greater weapon than Love.</i>

1795
02:37:56,833 --> 02:37:57,625
Click.

1796
02:38:07,833 --> 02:38:13,083
<i>That night we witnessed
the birth of a divine Hero.</i>

1797
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:17,958
<i>Now, he needed no source to create Fire.</i>

1798
02:38:24,792 --> 02:38:26,582
<i>The Darkest night was ending...</i>

1799
02:38:26,583 --> 02:38:28,333
<i>The Light was here.</i>

1800
02:38:29,125 --> 02:38:31,667
<i>We had won the battle.</i>

1801
02:38:45,875 --> 02:38:47,917
<i>But the war...</i>

1802
02:38:48,792 --> 02:38:50,500
<i>still remains.</i>

1803
02:38:58,875 --> 02:39:00,375
Hail Brahm-Dev!
