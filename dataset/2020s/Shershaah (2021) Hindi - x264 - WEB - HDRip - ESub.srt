541
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:55,792
Please say yes?

542
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:00,625
Quick, there's a stone
digging into my knee!

543
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,792
Yes!

544
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,833
Yes, I'll marry you.

545
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,500
I knew it.
I was pointlessly stressed.

546
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,583
You said I'm booked, right?

547
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,000
Thought I'll check once.

548
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:42,125
Sweetheart, why don't you wait inside?

549
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,083
What's your name, son?

550
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:55,417
Vikram, Uncle.

551
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,667
There must be something
after Vikram, right?

552
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,042
Of course. Batra. Vikram Batra.

553
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:04,250
So you're a Punjabi Khatri, then?

554
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,208
Yes.

555

With a smile, Uncle put a
full-stop to their love story

560
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,750
Vikram was getting impatient.

561
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:30,625
But knowing him,
he always had a Plan B ready.

563
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,250
Didn't you want
to join the Army, son?

564
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,375
Papa, where will
I get a better salary?

565
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:42,625
My life will be settled.

566
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:46,042
Anyway, Vishal is still
studying in Shimla...

567
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,583
I thought it's a good job,
why not take it up?

568
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:52,625
I'll be able to support
both our family and myself.

569

Who's the girl?

570

even in your dreams!

Her name's Dimple.

576
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,833
And... we want to get married.

577
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:22,542
Kamal!

578
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,375

He's found a girl too.

I don't know whether to
scream with joy or slap you hard!

582
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:38,792
Things have gotten this far,
and we haven't even seen the girl's face!

583
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,625
Don't you have a photo of her?

584
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,500

No Ma, she's a Sikh.

So what?

600
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,375
We don't have any problem. Right?

601
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,292
Yes, but her father does.

Papa, Vikram's going to
join the Merchant Navy.

617
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:56,375
He'll earn a higher salary than you.

618
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,292
Don't worry about how
he'll take care of me.

619
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,167
He'll manage.

620
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:04,000
And Mummy, no more discussion
on this topic from now.

621
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,875
I'll only marry Vikram.

622

And you come along.

And if I don't let you, then?

624
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Then Papa,

625
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,250
If I can't marry Vikram...

626
00:34:18,625 --> 00:34:21,000
I won't marry anyone, ever.

627
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:30,167
You're making a big mistake,
let me tell you.

I've known you since the time
we used to skinny dip in this river.

Didn't you always say,
"I'll join the army!"

635
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:49,917
What happened now?

And I'll still be serving
the country, right?

639
00:34:58,042 --> 00:34:59,792
That was a dream,
this is real life.

640
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,167
This isn't facing reality,
you're making a compromise.

641

Why don't you get it?

Sacrificing your dreams
for love will cost you dearly.

If someone else shatters your dreams,
you can get back on track.

It's no big deal.

But if you kill your own dreams,
you'll die from within.

Got it?

647
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,208
And a man who has died within,
can neither be happy...

648
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:33,833
nor can he keep anybody else happy.

When I go home next week,
I'll hold her in my arms for the first time.

926
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,167
Haider took revenge
for Attaullah from us.

927
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,833
This has to stop.

928
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:02,625
We have to get back at them,

929
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:06,083
or the Kashmiris will
lose faith in our army.

He died my death, Jimmy.

That bullet was meant for me,
and he took it.

933
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,250
It was meant for me.

934
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,250
That bullet had Bansi's
name on it, Vicky.

935
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:29,292
The ones that carry our names...

936

From from this day on,
no one in my company will die.

00:53:46,792 --> 00:53:49,833
If there's any casualty other
than the enemy, it will be me.

939
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:53,292
No one will die on my watch again.

940
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,625
Brother Gafoor, I want to meet Arslaan.

941
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:17,000
He's not home. Please leave.

942
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:18,042
Let us be.

943
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,708
Don't be scared, Brother Gafoor.

944
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,250
Nothing will happen to Arslaan.

945
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,625
It's my responsibility to protect you.

946
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,208
You can't protect yourselves,
how will you protect us?

947
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:31,708
Look, I need to meet Arsalan
to find out Haider's location.

948
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,500
- Arslaan can't meet you.
- Abbu!

949
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,958
- Arslaan. Arslaan.
- Arslaan, go inside!

950
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,042
Son, I don't want to see
your corpse hanging in the streets.

951
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:44,875
- Arslaan...
- Batra Sir...

952
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
if you really care about us

953
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:51,042
then please leave us alone.

954
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,250
Arslaan,
this is the only chance we have.

955
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,417
You won't say anything, Arslaan!

956
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,208
You want to get out
of this mess, right?

957
00:54:57,667 --> 00:54:58,667
You must know something?

958
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,000
- No, Arslaan.
- Where can I find Haider?

959
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:01,042
Don't say anything, Arslaan.

960
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,667
Now's the time,
tell me what you know.

961
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,958
There's no need to say anything!

962
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,417
There is, Abbu! I need to do this.

963
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:10,417
I'd rather die helping the army
than die helping terrorists.

964
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,917
I know where you'll find Haider.

965
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,000
Roger. Over and out.

966
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,000
Sir, I just verified
the info with M.I.

967
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:30,000
Haider is surely on the move,
but they can't confirm his exact location.

968
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:31,583
What should we do, sir?

969
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,333
Subbu, what do you think?

970
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,708
We should take this chance, sir.

971
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:45,000
If it's a false tip,
we'll deal with it.

972
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:46,667
But if it's correct...

973
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,333
Why give Haider a chance to escape?

974
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,667
If your tip is wrong,
you know the consequences, right?

975
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,625
I'll give up the stars
on my shoulder, sir.

976
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,167
You trust your source this much?

977
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,875
Who is it? Any name?

978
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:02,417
Sorry sir, can't do that.

979
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:04,917
I learnt that from you.

980
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,208
Neither ask anyone about
their sources, nor reveal your own.

981
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,083
Okay. Go for it.

982
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:15,500

983
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:16,500
- Jimmy and I...
- No.

984
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:18,042
Not Jimmy.

985
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,542
You'll go solo.

986
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,167
Given the risk involved,

987
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,917
I can't send both my best officers
on the same mission.

988
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,583
Vicky this is your intel.

989
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:27,667
You command this operation.

990
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:28,958
Pick your own team

991
00:56:29,125 --> 00:56:31,042
and I want you out of there
before daybreak.

00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:32,083

1000
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:02,708
Request permission to move in, sir.

1001
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,792
Have you seen the target yet?

1002
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:07,625
No sir.

1003
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:10,083
Till Haider isn't seen inside
the house, you're not going in.

1004
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,375
I don't want any
civilian casualties.

1005
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,833
First visually ID the target
and then only attack.

1006
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:15,917
And then get back to me.

00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,875

we need to go inside!

You're commanding the unit.

1011
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,167
You have to take the decision.

1012
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:30,000
You have my full support,
but keep in mind...

1013
00:59:30,708 --> 00:59:32,042
This would be like
walking on a landmine.

1014

making a great example -

Has any other 24 year old
in the army pulled such a feat?

to the entire regiment.

Listen boys.

If you're a soldier,

1054
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:37,417
then you live by chance,

We've already violated the Geneva Treaty
by taking their soldiers captive...

1077

both the countries should refrain from

upon the LOC during peak winters.

1085

our guns should fire.

1086
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:48,625
And kill the Indian soldiers
with such brute force

1087
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:51,500

bear to see their corpses.

the chance to go to war at least once.

1244
01:17:15,875 --> 01:17:17,667
For Vikram, this was it.

1245
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:22,125
Every regiment and battalion of the Indian
Army was present at the Ghumri Base.

1246
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:25,000
Vikram had faced the enemy forces before...

1247
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:27,375
But this was something else.

1248
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,667
They had no idea how difficult
it was going to be.

1249
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:34,208
13 JAK RIF was just a reserve force.

1250
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:37,792
Their job was to acclimatise
and wait for further orders.

1251
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:49,542
One tiny corn, and Dr Rajesh says
I'm unfit for war.

1252
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:52,333
Jassi sir, what will we do
without you at the battlefield?

1253
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:55,583
Yeah. We thought we'll make you
our shield and hide behind you.

1254
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:57,167
I can hide behind your leg!

1255
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,792
Don't worry. I'm ready,
let them bring it on.

1256
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,833
I'll finish every last one of them.

1257
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:03,750
That's the spirit, Jassi!

1258
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:04,792
We all know...

1259
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,875
You can take down an
entire battalion by yourself!

1260
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:12,708
[Shelling, explosions]

1261
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,542
Shelling! Shelling!
Take cover!

1262
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:30,708
Come on! Come on!

1263
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:38,167
[Explosion]

1264
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:18,875
Take cover.

1265
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,583
Move. Move.

1266
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,458
Take cover!

1267
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:11,792
Jassi.

1268
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:12,667
Rajeev.

1269
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:17,500
I tried really hard
but couldn't save him.

1270
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:22,875
The shelling has stopped.

1271
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,500
Never mind.

1272
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:26,625
Let's save the other injured men.

1273
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,875
Come on.

1274
01:20:28,625 --> 01:20:29,708
I can't get up, man.

1275
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:33,000
Come on Jassi.
Don't be ridiculous. Come!

1276
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:37,667
Vicky!

1277
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:40,583
Sir.

1278
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,833
At the back.

1279
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:43,833
What happened to our shield?

1280
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,958
Jassi Sir! Jassi Sir, you...

1281
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,292
Call Dr. Rajesh immediately.

1282
01:20:49,417 --> 01:20:52,000
Rajesh Sir. Rajesh Sir!

1283
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:54,542
- Look at Jassi Sir.
- Let me check.

1284
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,417
- Turn, turn.
- Jassi Sir...

1285
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,667
His spine is injured.

1286
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,417
Shrapnel has gone inside.

1287
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,167
Call the ambulance immediately.

1288
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:05,958
Ambulance!

1289
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,625
Let's go.

1290
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:07,417
Meher Singh!

1291
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,292
Don't worry, Jassi Sir.
Nothing will happen to you.

1292
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:11,208
Jassi Sir!

1293
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,333
I know you'll be back...

1294
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,833
to destroy the enemy.

1295
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:14,625
What happened to him?

1296
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:16,250
- And this time, we'll be your shield.
- Doctor!

1297
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:17,250
Jassi Sir.

1298
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:17,792
Vicky...

1299
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,917
Vicky, I...

1300
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,292
Don't worry, Jassi Sir.

1301
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:22,292
Jassi Sir!

1302
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:23,333
Jassi Sir...

1303
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:24,500
- Jassi Sir...
- Sir?

1304
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:25,583
Jassi Sir?

1305
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Jassi Sir?

1306
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:29,208
Sir?

1307
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:40,667
Jassi Sir!

1308
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:14,583
Couldn't even give
Jassi Sir a proper hug.

1309
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:24,625
War's a bitch, man.

1310
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,708
Doesn't even let you say goodbye
to your loved ones properly.

1311
01:22:30,292 --> 01:22:34,958
Don't know if we'll even
be able to return home.

1312
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,583
Don't think of home now.

1313
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,125
Come on boys...

1314
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,458
The war's not over yet.

1315
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,750
The latest clash between
Indian and Pakistani forces

1316
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:55,083
resulted in many casualties among
soldiers of the 2nd Rajputana Rifles.

1317
01:22:55,292 --> 01:22:57,333
However, in the 3rd week
of this war

1318
01:22:57,417 --> 01:23:01,375
India has recaptured
the Tololing Pass from Pakistan

1319
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,250
While Pakistan remains in
a strong position currently,

1320
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:08,417
The Indian Army's strong response
has pushed them on the defensive.

1321
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,417
[Footsteps]

1322
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:11,750
At ease, boys.

1323
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:17,917
13 JAK RIF is no longer
a Reserve Force.

1324
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:20,542
We've taken over from 2nd Raj Rif.

1325
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:23,208
Which means, we're going to war.

1326
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,917
First, I'll be assigning
you code names

1327
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,958
which will be used in
radio communication.

1328
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:29,875
- Major Rajeev Kapoor.
- Yes sir.

1329
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:32,083
- You're Maharana Pratap.
- Sir!

1330
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:35,792
- Captain Rajesh Adhau, you're Charak.
- Sir!

1331
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,250
My code name is Chanakya.

1332
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:40,875
- Captain Sanjeev Jamwal.
- Sir!

1333
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:42,750
- Your code name is Sangram.
- Sir!

1334
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:45,000
- And Lieutenant Vikram Batra.
- Sir!

1335
01:23:45,667 --> 01:23:48,500
- Your code name is Shershaah.
- Sir!

1336
01:23:49,417 --> 01:23:52,542
We've been given the task
to recapture Pt. 5140.

1337
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,500
This is Pt. 5140.

1338
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,167
Till we don't expel the
Pakistanis from here...

1339
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,792
our men will keep getting killed.

1340
01:24:00,083 --> 01:24:02,250
Boys, the shelling that
took Major Jasrotia's life...

1341
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:04,000
came from this Pt. 5140.

1342
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:06,292
This is our peak
which they have captured.

1343
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,375
Thanks to Major Bhaskar
and Major Vohra...

1344
01:24:08,458 --> 01:24:09,042
Sir!

1345
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:12,583
13 JAK RIF has recaptured
Rocky Knob and the Hump area too.

1346
01:24:15,042 --> 01:24:17,708
From now onwards,
this will be our forward base.

1347
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,042
[Gun cocking]

1348
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:22,500
Now listen up boys.

1349
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,500
Plenty of wars have been
fought on mountains,

1350
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:27,125
But this is going to be the
toughest mountain warfare ever.

1351
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:32,208
The reason being, Pt. 5140
is at an altitude of 17000 feet.

1352
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:34,875
Oxygen levels are extremely low.

1353
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,833
As you climb higher,
you'll get more short of breath.

1354
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:39,375
But I know you boys.

1355
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:43,417
You both have the strength and
the spirit to accomplish this task.

1356
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:44,958
But boys, it's not going to be easy.

1357
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,875
You'll need every ounce of your stamina
to recapture this peak for us.

1358
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,458
Sir!

1359
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:52,750
This point is hard
to capture in the day

1360
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:55,083
because the enemy is
in a dominating position

1361
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:56,375
and can watch us.

1362
01:24:56,917 --> 01:24:58,875
You'll have to leave at last light

1363
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:01,000
and strike assault at first light.

1364
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:02,458
- Jimmy.
- Sir.

1365
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:04,458
Your Bravo company
will approach this peak

1366
01:25:04,542 --> 01:25:08,208
from the Eastern side
and destroy the bunkers.

1367
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:14,542
And Vicky, your Delta company
will approach this feature

1368
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:18,542
from the South and
destroy the bunkers there.

1369
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:22,660
It's a challenging climb
of 70 to 80 degrees.

1370
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:27,208
But the advantage is the enemy
won't expect you from this route.

1371
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:31,583
Now boys, to engage the enemy
on both your routes

1372
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,917
I'll have continued firing
from the artillery base.

1373
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:37,708
When you both are 200 meters
from the enemy position,

1374
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:38,917
just send me a signal.

1375
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:41,000
I'll stop the artillery fire.

1376
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:42,000
Did you guys get it?

1377
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:43,083
- Got it, sir.
- Got it, sir.

1378
01:25:43,167 --> 01:25:45,750
Now boys,
what will your victory signal be?

1379
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:47,000
Jimmy?

1380
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:49,625
Sir, "Oh yeah yeah!"

1381
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:50,917
And Vicky, yours?

1382
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,500
"Yeh Dil Maange More"!
(The heart craves more)

1383
01:25:56,833 --> 01:25:58,417
Why "Yeh Dil Maange More", Vicky?

1384
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:01,417
Sir I'm not going
to stop after Pt. 5140.

1385
01:26:02,833 --> 01:26:04,250
I want to get these
bastards out of here.

1386
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:06,583
All the best boys.

1387
01:26:07,125 --> 01:26:08,125
Godspeed!

1388
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:29,583
Here are our neighbours.

1389
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:30,708
Fire!

1390
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:32,542
[Explosion]

1391
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:52,083
Sangram for Shershaah.

1392
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,500
Sangram for Shershaah. Over.

1393
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,292
Sir!

1394
01:26:56,667 --> 01:26:58,417
Sangram for Shershaah. Over.

1395
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:00,458
Sangram for Shershaah.

1396
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:01,667
Sangram for Shershaah. Come in.

1397
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,292
He's mentioning
some 'Shershaah', sir.

1398
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:05,750
Catch the frequency. Quick.

1399
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:08,833
Shershaah for Sangram.

1400
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:10,208
Pass message. Over.

1401
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:11,958
I'm 300 meters away
from the objective.

1402
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,542
Report your location. Over.

1403
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:16,792
Did you go riding
on a horse? Over.

1404
01:27:16,958 --> 01:27:18,958
You ass, quickly tell
me your location. Over.

1405
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:21,333
I'm also 200 meters away. Over.

1406
01:27:21,417 --> 01:27:23,333
Did you arrive on a rocket?

1407
01:27:23,917 --> 01:27:25,458
Your horse is faster than my rocket.

1408
01:27:25,875 --> 01:27:27,000
It'll take me time.

1409
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:30,708
It's an incline
of 85 degrees ahead.

1410
01:27:31,708 --> 01:27:32,917
You go for it buddy.

1411
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,458
Good luck Sangram. Over.

1412
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:35,708
Good luck.

1413
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:36,625
Over and out.

1414
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:57,917
It's the frequency of the enemy, sir.

1415

Okay, when will you be back?

1595

this one last mission.

01:41:52,583 --> 01:41:53,875
And a suit for you too?

1598
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,250
Of course.

1599
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:57,292

I love you.

I love you.

1603
01:42:02,958 --> 01:42:05,042
Okay bye. I'll hang up now.

1604
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:16,417
I'm not going to give you a
loud lecture on patriotism.

1605
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:19,917
You're patriots,
that's why you're here.

1606
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:26,000
No one can defeat a man
who doesn't fear death.

1607
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,042
And I know you guys
have lost that fear long back.

1608
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:40,375
Honestly, I feel we guys from
Delta Company are really lucky

1609
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:45,958
that we've been given the task
to eliminate the enemy from Pt. 4875.

1610
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,333
Because whoever captures this peak

1611
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:53,792
can control 70 km
of Indian territory.

1612
01:42:58,125 --> 01:42:59,708
The Pakistanis are squatting
up there right now.

1613
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:02,583
We'll get rid of each one of them

1614
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:06,417
and recapture Pt. 4875.

1615
01:43:08,042 --> 01:43:09,333
Do you know what that means?

1616
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:12,917
It means that if we get Pt. 4875,

1617
01:43:14,583 --> 01:43:16,167
the Kargil war will be over.

1618

Each soldier in our
company will fight to ensure

1621
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:27,708
that the enemy is
removed from our land.

1622
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:31,958
If you win this war for India,
you'll become immortal.

1624

you'll live on forever.
