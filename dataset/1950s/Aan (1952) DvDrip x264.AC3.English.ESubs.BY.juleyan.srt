For dinner, split your good,

a t gravesite you.

180
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:50,204
This is only a playing field.

181
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,639
Do not take this duel? S rious.

182
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,919
It's just a matter
which is measured? his king.

183
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:58,998
Not enemies, friends.

184
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:02,039
Your willingness? will be made, Majesty ?.

185
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,206
I Have! I Have!

186
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,683
You're lucky

187
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,478
it is a game.

188
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:33,438
Why did you do that? A?

189
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:36,559
Why did you call? ?
Why have emp? Ch? ?

190
00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:39,759
He did not lose.
I will tell the king that he has not lost.

191
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,043
Jai has not lost.

192
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:57,717
Majesty ?, he has not lost.
He expr? S.

193
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:01,404
I swear. I say the honest truth ?.

194
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,962
He ob? I to the orders of his m? Re.

195
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,886
Majesty ?, I saw with my own eyes.

196
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:11,078
I beg you to justice.

197
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,002
Majesty ?,
you saw the strength of these hands?

198
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:17,002
I defeated my kingdom? P? E.

199
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:20,446
And have backed up?
? the strength of my? p? e.

200
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,724
You're lucky, prince.
Without his m? Re, I would have seen your strength.

201
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:27,119
To defeat Jai,
you would not have been enough seven lives.

202
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,076
I'm not afraid.
M? Me if we should cut my t? Te.

203
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:34,319
The honest truth can not be denied ?.
You would not fight Jai, never!

204
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,564
Let her.

205
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,884
Jai is for you?

206
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:48,925
Nothing for the moment.
But it will become

207
00:22:49,927 --> 00:22:51,645
Commander.

208
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,120
My m? Re wants me the eye wife

209
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,404
but he said he refused
to? marry a witch? re.

210
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:03,199
But I want to tell him that mare.

211
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:06,526
Otherwise it will be in a bad mood
and? s not nera.

212
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:08,678
Take the horse? the eye curia.

213
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:10,365
Wait.

214
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,760
Ch? Re sister, you have to pay your debt.

215
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:19,044
You insult your sister by taking part
for this set? rable.

216
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,482
This is not an insult.
It must? Be right.

217
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,518
This is unfair, Majesty ?.

218
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:26,360
I break it? sound? p? e
and have overcome in public.

219
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:29,800
You? Carriage too silent? to see

220
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:34,525
he had broken? sound? p? e his m? me,
to keep his pride ?.

221
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,766
The girl told the honest truth ?.

222
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:42,724
You can take the mare.

223
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,485
You are a god, Majesty ?.

224
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:49,119
No, my child, I am human,
like you.

225
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:54,159
Will serve? eat dinner? Jai tone.

Like I amen? E.

228
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:24,566
Why did you look so d ?? u?
You have not lost.

229
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:28,516
The king acknowledged your victory.

230
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:32,319
"Shamsher Singh, you lie"
he said.

231
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:35,442
"Mangala said the honest truth."

232
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:38,316
"Whether it takes the mare."

233
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,923
My dear subjects,

because I have to talk to you.

237
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,239
You saw that my fr? Re
Shamsher Singh

238
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:08,082
has shown? the power of his? p? e
? Through its habilet ?.

239
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:14,197
And my sister Rajeshwari,

00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:38,359
"My body and my heart are on fire

250
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:42,725
"God knows when I'll find love"

251
00:26:57,087 --> 00:26:59,681
Raj, why this collar? Re?

252
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:04,359
Many paris can? Be won? S
apr? s one? s done.

253
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:08,561
But some lost paris
are actually wins.

254
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,596
This is not my d? D done to me? Range,
but your principles.

255
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,646
What do you want from me?

I have everything organized? Travel,
Majesty ?.

261
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,122
Your boat is pr? T.

262
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:58,326
According to pr? Visions,
the wind will be tr? s favorable.

263
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:03,079
But the tide can turn.
Who knows when it will change direction?

264
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:06,957
God bless you for? Be
our king thousands of ann? es.

You'll soon be back, my fr? Re.

Ton en? Re, possibly master,

268
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,279
but not the king.

269

Before I d? Hand,
everyone has r? cup? rer of his ?.

270
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:26,441
It will be your responsibility ?, Shamsher.

271
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:30,965
Shamsher live the king!
Shamsher live the king!

272
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:37,723
The people is mistaken.
My h? Heir is not Shamsher Singh.

273
00:28:39,007 --> 00:28:40,645
Who is it then?

274
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:46,716
My subjects. Long live the people!

275
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:54,039
You will sign this, Shamsher.

276
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,003
As you wish.

277
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:06,519
N If your feelings? Were not
those of a fr? re but those of a p? re,

278
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:08,959
would you be so unfair?

279
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,119
If my feelings? Were those of a fr? Re,
it would be an injustice.

280
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,878
But my feelings are those of a p? Re.

281
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,561
P? Re who has known injustice
for thousands of ann? es,

282
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:20,679
and now wants to? be fair
to his children.

283
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,916
My children are my subjects.

284
00:29:24,367 --> 00:29:26,483
They are slaves
you call your children.

285
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,299
Do you want to? Destroy honor
of our ancestors?

286
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:30,596
Ch? Re sister, honor
accompanied them? s in the grave.

287
00:29:30,924 --> 00:29:33,916
They do permit? some portraits
in frames dor? s.

288
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:40,041
V? Rit ?, in this palace dor ?,
we are living portraits.

289
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:45,556
But these portraits
have? p? r es well? them.

290
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,835
And they have the power.

291
00:29:49,124 --> 00:29:53,720
God has given you?
the strength to carry the? p? e.

292
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,876
But never forget
those who support the cruelty?

293
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,996
are stronger than those
who r? gnent by it.

294
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:03,562
The kingdoms are made and d? Do.

295
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:07,280
The? P? Es shine and break.

296
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:10,876
But aspirations? Clear? Es

297
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:16,560
never can? be? crushed? es.
Never.

298
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:33,440
Forgive me, my king.

299
00:31:33,884 --> 00:31:37,320
You wanted to make the king a subject,
and go about a king.

300
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:43,160
Mangal Singh! You will go
as king in the land? trang? re.

301
00:31:43,964 --> 00:31:47,036
But Mangal Singh
shall? be recognized by the princess.

302
00:31:47,644 --> 00:31:50,238
The princess will want to see the king.

303
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:54,156
She can not see it.

304
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:13,483
You filled out your mission.
You've given? your life.

305
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:18,276
You sacrificed? your life not for your king
but for the people.

This wildflower
has spines venomous.

I know how to? Avoid
the thorns flowers.

328

Paper flowers, probably.

329
00:35:36,364 --> 00:35:40,516
But the bravest
will not dare to approach it.

What are you looking at?
Cut the tree

337
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:34,722

We'll see if they continue to spend.

That's him, right?

341
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:38,923
No, he did not know.
Was shot? the tree to block the road.

The car of Prince had renvers?
the grain wagon.

343

Hey, take it back trunk.
What are you looking at?

344
00:37:48,924 --> 00:37:52,837
One would need multiple donkeys
to remove.
