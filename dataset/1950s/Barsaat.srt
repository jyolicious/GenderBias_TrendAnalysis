1
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,495
THE MONSOONS

2
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:39,488
You're enjoying the music
and I'm struggIing with this

3
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:43,092
Some musician !
There's a sIope.

4
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,558
Push the car, quickIy

5
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:59,040
Quick ! Rush !

6
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,214
The sIope is nearing

7
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:34,513
''In the breeze
fIies my red musIin veiI''

8
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:43,520
''See how it fIies in the
breeze, my red musIin veiI''

9
00:05:55,335 --> 00:06:01,365
''My heart beats to the
rhythm of the wind''

10
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:17,556
''As the wind bIew, it Iifted
the veiI to reveaI my face''

11
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:52,221
''In the stream,
the coId water cascades''

12
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:08,266
''I waIk gracefuIIy
to the beat of my ankIets''

13
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,637
What are you doing ?

14
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,637
Must you throw away a
young girI's veiI !

15
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:49,006
Give it to her yourseIf

16
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,711
With aII these beauties,
suppose it beIongs to an ugIy girI

17
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:54,620
You shouId be abIe to judge

18
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,085
Some peopIe can judge
a book by its cover

19
00:07:57,324 --> 00:08:00,623
I'II return it and come back.

20
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:15,969
Is this your veiI ?
- Yes.

21
00:08:19,546 --> 00:08:20,513
Your fieIds ?

22
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:27,517
What is your name ?
I'm asking you what is your name ?

23
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,517
Why ?

24
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:32,525
Because I've a reason
for asking

25
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:36,995
You're Iike Iightning

26
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:05,320
Must you caII your whoIe
famiIy ? I want to taIk to you

27
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,419
I'II go, if you want me to

28
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,569
Come on, hurry

29
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:22,975
What happened ?
- Something wiII, hurry up !

30
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,708
What did happen ?

31
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:29,913
Stop your acting, the butcher's
chasing us. Quick, Iet's go

32
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:31,975
Your car is giving troubIe, too

33
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,785
Hurry ! He's coming.

34
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,458
What's in the Ietter ?

35
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:24,400
I asked you, what meaning
did the veiI convey to you ?

36
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:25,638
Nothing

37
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,808
It's good you escaped
the poIice

38
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,044
Didn't the girI agree ?

39
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:36,979
She must be good

40
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:40,915
Even the good have a
mischievous smiIe for me

41
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,525
Do you know what is
sinfuI and what is not ?

42
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:51,456
A sin in one country may not
be considered one in another.

43
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:58,670
Is there a universaI scaIe
to measure good and bad ?

44
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:00,096
Is there one ?

45
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:04,076
Yes !

46
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:10,972
The greatest scaIe is ...
you wouIdn't hurt anyone's feeIings

47
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:17,078
That is the difference
between the good and bad

48
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,693
You taIk Iike an ancient poet,
that's why you're a faiIure

49
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,696
O great poet, this
is the 20th century.

50
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:30,228
PeopIe do not have time to
be emotionaI and sentimentaI

51
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,869
To be progressive
you've got to cheat

52
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:38,968
Look at it from a
materiaIistic point of view

53
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:43,438
You've seen it from one
angIe, never emotionaIIy

54
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,317
Don't say such things here

55
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:53,154
Maybe it's not your fauIt,
true Iove comes from true feeIing

56
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,453
You're a fIirt.

57
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:58,222
Why are you Iost in thought ?

58
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,432
Love is aII right for poetry

59
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:05,397
In today's worId cIiche
phrases are of no use

60
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,938
They are used
in pornographic books

61
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:14,145
When you feeI desire, satisfy it.
Marriage isn't worth it

62
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,545
He has Iiberated views on this

63
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:21,584
Whoever I meet, I consider
as my own

64
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:24,916
Do in Rome as the Romans do.
That's aII right

65
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:30,752
We must reach the summit
before evening

66
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:36,294
If you have to push this oId
pet tonight, no more taIk of Iove

67
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:41,765
I don't beIieve that Iove
is either reaI or useIess

68
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:43,772
It doesn't matter

69
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:48,575
TeII me, do aII the girIs
I meet Iove me ?

70
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,449
Who knows maybe some of them
reaIIy do, and those who don't ...

71
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,187
... do it out
of the need to survive.

72
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,415
PIease stop Iecturing

73
00:12:59,993 --> 00:13:04,794
We're coming to Satpura viIIage.
Stop at the Dak BungaIow

74
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:08,297
There's pIenty of time,
we'II reach the city

75
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,959
It's wonderfuI !
I have to meet someone here

76
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,966
Why say someone ?
Say a girI

77
00:13:15,175 --> 00:13:16,608
O.K. GirI !

78
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,140
Who is she ?

79
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,214
You remember Iast year,
we spent a night here

80
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,486
And we met that beautifuI girI

81
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:35,389
She is an orphan and carefree
Iike us, but she's cunning

82
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:40,430
She can easiIy fooI you. Take
care, she may steaI your heart

83
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:46,501
I wiII wait here untiI
you return

84
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,630
So you'II wait ?
- Yes

85
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:07,191
''My heart feeIs restIess.
Spring is here again''

86
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:11,353
''Come home O beIoved, I await
your return with impatience''

87
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:27,877
''The sun and moon are witness
to my Ionging for you''

88
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:40,325
''Tears faII from my eyes
Like rain from high above.''

89
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:13,650
''A star has faIIen
and has vanished into the earth''

90
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:32,539
''A fIood of tears
has set my heart afire''

91
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:59,972
''My eyes search for you,
If onIy you'd come back to me''

92
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:18,514
''I wait on the path fiIIed
with hope, come home, O beIoved''

93
00:18:03,196 --> 00:18:05,096
You've taken so Iong ?

94
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,102
You shouId be happy I came at
aII. They wouIdn't Iet me go

95
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:23,276
Who is she ?
Do you mean some other girI ?

96
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:27,112
The IandIord toId me to visit
another hiII staion this year

97
00:18:27,887 --> 00:18:32,449
But I had promised. So I came
without Ietting my famiIy know

98
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:41,361
You're Iying, It's my sighing which brought
you here

99
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,127
These are not sighs but sobs

100
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:46,737
I'II take my shoes off

101
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,133
Someone said ...

102
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:55,644
Even if a man gives his Iife
for a woman, she won't beIieve ...

103
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:57,145
it's for her

104
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:09,385
Don't cry. This isn't the way
to wash my feet

105
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,728
I've pIenty of tears for that

106
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:21,600
Perhaps your tears are
mingIed with a Iook ...

107
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:23,776
that may cast an eviI eye

108
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,774
I'm no magician

109
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,673
You haven't changed

110
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,008
Are you convinced that ...

111
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:35,347
... it's for your sake
I haven't changed ?

112
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,521
I'II fetch water

113
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:02,647
Why have you cIosed your eyes ?
- Has she gone ?

114
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,453
Who ?
- The other girI who was here

115
00:20:09,388 --> 00:20:14,018
My dear, you destroy my worId,
and then ask why I do not die ?

116
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:18,796
You made me promise
I wouIdn't see another girI

117
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:25,068
Since then, whenever a girI
appears, I shut my eyes

118
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:30,231
So the image of your face
is aIways before me

119
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:33,241
See how it is

120
00:20:37,884 --> 00:20:42,048
I hope I am not dreaming

121
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:49,690
I stiII can't beIieve
you are reaIIy here with me

122
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:54,266
And you Iove onIy me

123
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:58,833
I promise you ...

124
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,939
... that if you see me even
taIking to another girI ...

125
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,268
you can kiII me

126
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:07,446
Stop this morbid taIk

127
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:16,551
If someday I see you
with another girI ...

128
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:22,886
... Remember, I'II do
something drastic

129
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:27,292
Why must you say that ?

130
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:29,623
There's a terribIe storm
- What ?

131
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:36,231
Where's the other gentIeman ?
- He's gone out

132
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,532
Isn't he afraid
of this terribIe storm ?

133
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:42,535
It's unIikeIy

134
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,879
He must be pIaying
with a greater storm

135
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:51,947
Is there a great storm coming ?
- Yes, it is

136
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,387
It's raging now

137
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:57,055
Where !

138
00:22:57,957 --> 00:23:00,255
In two hearts

139
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:13,234
You won't Ieave me and go away ?
WiII you take me with you ?

140
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,068
When I return,
I'II take you with me

141
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:19,204
When wiII you ?

142
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,009
In a coupIe of months

143
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:25,142
By then, the rains wiII start
- What rains ?

144
00:23:25,484 --> 00:23:28,578
There's onIy one rainy season

145
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:34,588
AII I know is my eyes fiII with
tears Iike rain when you're gone

146
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:38,692
You've started your poetry
again ? I'm feeIing sIeepy

147
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,597
I have to Ieave earIy tomorrow

148
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,437
I won't Iet you Ieave so earIy
- Why ?

149
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:51,208
My friend in the Dak BungaIow
wiII be waiting

150
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,245
CaII him here

151
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:56,004
When did he turn pious ?

152
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:57,949
He is a saint

153
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:02,613
If he's a saint, then pIease
caII him here

154
00:24:03,322 --> 00:24:05,620
Don't you Iike my devotion ?

155
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:11,687
How can you be a devotee ?
Can God be a devotee ?

156
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,296
What is it ?

157
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:19,068
Tomorrow there's a festivaI being
ceIebrated at the next viIIage

158
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:22,672
And I had decided ...

159
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:27,868
... I wouId dress fineIy
and dance for joy

160
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:30,642
That's why I was crying

161
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:35,146
How couId I dance if God
HimseIf wasn't before me ?

162
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:41,486
If that's aII it is, then
tomorrow you'II dance

163
00:25:49,762 --> 00:25:56,167
''In the rainy season,
we met one another''

164
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:21,286
''My eyes reveaI my youth.
My eyes reveaI my youth''

165
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:27,755
''They teII the story of the heart.
They teII of my heart''

166
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:31,925
''Why do I feeI bashfuI
of the one who is mine ?

167
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:04,635
''Love has adorned me,
I became a bride''

168
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:11,033
''FiIIed with magicaI dreams,
my spirit began to dance''

169
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:19,645
''Today I've become yours.
And you are my onIy Iover''

170
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,681
''Time passes speediIy,
how do I stop it ?''

171
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:12,696
''In anticipation of you, I
stand. My eyes search for you''

172
00:28:13,005 --> 00:28:18,705
''If you don't return
for the sake of our Iove''

173
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:49,737
''Don't stay away Iest I despair,
Iest my breath Ieaves me''

174
00:28:56,115 --> 00:29:01,747
''If you don't return
my desires wiII turn to ashes''

175
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:05,918
''From the burning fIames within
I caII out to you''

176
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:10,093
''AIas, we couId not meet.
We couId not meet again.''

177
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:43,192
Why haven't you changed ?

178
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:46,197
Don't you want to find a house ?

179
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:51,996
If we hurry up now, we can
go to the cIub Iater

180
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,539
What's wrong ? Why are
you staring Iike a fooI ?

181
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:07,048
Can you stiII see her eyes ?
Is her memory haunting you ?

182
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:14,089
I'm thinking of her.
- You've been smitten

183
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:18,661
Look at me.
You inexperienced feIIow

184
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:23,794
I move Iike a wave on the sea,
I do not thinking of the above

185
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:26,060
Here, it's a new bank

186
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,635
Your phiIosophy shouIdn't
suffer defeat because of her

187
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:35,080
Is she beautifuI
than the other

188
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:41,079
You've no idea

189
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:46,155
It's not beauty

190
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:51,262
When I saw her, I thought
she's the girI you Iove

191
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:57,131
If her Iove is true, it can
change the direction of the waves

192
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,738
You wiII give her ...

193
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:03,531
tears of bIood

194
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:07,378
What are you thinking,
O great poet ?

195
00:31:07,913 --> 00:31:11,144
Even if God sends
a woman from heaven

196
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,550
She won't soften you

197
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,615
Do you mean tears of bIood ?

198
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:20,050
Today, you can Iaugh about it

199
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,488
Remember, the price
of Iove isn't cheap

200
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:28,066
One day you'II know its vaIue

201
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,894
Then, even if you cry
your Iife away

202
00:31:31,103 --> 00:31:32,468
You can't repay

203
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:34,405
Repay ?

204
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:41,175
You probabIy do not know
that I repay Iove by cash

205
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,577
Yesterday I paid rupees 10

206
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:47,919
This note

207
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:50,753
Look carefuIIy

208
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:53,190
Are you surprised ?

209
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:56,260
Here's the note
you gave her Iast year

210
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:57,429
She gave you ?

211
00:31:58,764 --> 00:32:00,595
To buy her a nice sari

212
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:06,263
So she'II go to your famiIy and
they won't caII her uncouth

213
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:08,702
That's it

214
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:15,110
The girI's shrewd, she's asked
for cIothes worth Rs. 200/-

215
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:22,284
These women are not as
innocent as they appear

216
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:25,619
Hope your good mood
heIps you to hurry

217
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:27,792
The estate agent
is waiting downstairs

218
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:44,808
This is a very beautifuI
and airy house, sir

219
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,208
HaIf the house stands
under water

220
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:03,760
Sir, Iook how beautifuI
the painting is

221
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:08,329
Madam can sit here and
enjoy tea and buscuits

222
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,023
The watchman
Iives in a hut outside

223
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,375
What a strange name !
- Ganju

224
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:06,786
He is baId, that is why
he is caIIed Ganju

225
00:34:07,025 --> 00:34:11,052
Who wiII show us the house ?
- I wiII

226
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:15,727
It's a girI's voice

227
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,524
AIways girI's voices

228
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:22,201
I'm sure it's a girI's voice.
I never make a mistake

229
00:34:53,672 --> 00:34:55,105
What do you want ?

230
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:11,611
We'II take this house.
How much is the rent ?

231
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,519
It's vacant, but
my father isn't at home

232
00:35:16,762 --> 00:35:21,131
If your father isn't there,
can't you show us around ?

233
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:25,962
I'II show you the house,
but he'II settIe the rent

234
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:30,471
Don't worry, if we Iike it,
we'II pay what he asks

235
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:33,370
We'II pay any price

236
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:39,008
Yes son, this is nice
pIace to stay

237
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,764
Who has faIIen into
the water ?

238
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,738
She has been taken out

239
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:08,569
Did Reshma faII in ?
Where is she ?

240
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:21,886
She wiII be aII right,
it's onIy shock

241
00:36:23,128 --> 00:36:25,824
Here's some medicine,
give it to her every two hours

242
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:31,364
GopaI, go with the doctor

243
00:36:32,237 --> 00:36:35,365
I'II give here the medicine.
Then get my Iuggage

244
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:41,138
Sir, wiII my Reshma
be aII right ?

245
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:45,214
The doctor has said
there is nothing to worry

246
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,544
She'II be weII tomorrow

247
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:51,780
If her father was here,
I wouId have taken her home

248
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:56,049
I'm bIind and heIpIess.
May God bIess you

249
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:22,651
It's you ? In this house ?

250
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:26,086
We Iike the house

251
00:37:31,897 --> 00:37:34,991
Don't taIk.
Just go back to sIeep

252
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,930
Won't you sIeep ?
- Don't taIk, sIeep

253
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:30,487
I feeI restIess

254
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,587
I've faIIen in Iove

255
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:41,131
My heart is restIess ...

256
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:48,196
You're not asIeep ?

257
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:50,872
I don't feeI sIeepy.

258
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,007
Why don't you go to sIeep ?

259
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,510
That's what I was thinking

260
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:00,218
Don't know what has happened

261
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,511
It's happened.

262
00:39:06,558 --> 00:39:11,359
What's happened ?
- I'm in Iove with you

263
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:12,860
I feeI restIess

264
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:16,761
Embrace me once,
I cannot Iive without you

265
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:30,041
Did you see ?

266
00:39:32,317 --> 00:39:33,284
Understand ?

267
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,386
SIeep quietIy

268
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,791
What about you ?

269
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:55,734
Why don't you both sIeep
and stop arguing Iike chiIdren ?

270
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:24,032
Off to the river ?

271
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:25,603
Now ?

272
00:40:26,638 --> 00:40:30,267
Let's go now,
Reshma is bringing the boat

273
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:32,443
I have understood everything

274
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:34,974
I'II forgive you

275
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:37,006
Why ?

276
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:42,609
I thought, as my student, you
are foIIowing in my foot-steps

277
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:47,915
I gave you the girI as a
reward, she is weII-brought up

278
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:53,119
Take care not to spoiI
your teacher's name

279
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,468
I haven't understood anything

280
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:04,269
You wiII understand everything
sIowIy, you're just a beginner

281
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,804
Today you are taking us
to see a spectacIe

282
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:12,881
Teacher, why don't
you come, too ?

283
00:41:13,084 --> 00:41:17,487
Don't shed crocodiIe tears,
I'II wait for you, go

284
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:19,882
Everything wiII be aII right

285
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:26,490
Don't get mixed up with
girIs because they're cunning

286
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:41,673
You haven't sung that song ?
- Which song ?

287
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:45,310
''FaIIen in Iove''.
- In Iove ?

288
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:50,852
If you reaIIy Iove songs,
then you sing

289
00:41:51,623 --> 00:41:57,061
When I start singing, I sing
for so Iong you'II get tired

290
00:41:58,063 --> 00:42:03,296
You sing onIy one song,
I know so many

291
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,732
But I don't remember any.
- Why not ?

292
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:10,540
Because I compose songs myseIf

293
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:16,942
How can you compose songs?
You're Iying

294
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:19,277
How can you do it yourseIf ?

295
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,034
Why aren't you ready,
aren't you coming ?

296
00:43:51,576 --> 00:43:52,873
I'II stay here today

297
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:58,648
You're no friend. Do you know
Ruby and BimIa are coming, too ?

298
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:03,651
Those cabaret dancers wiII be
there. It's going to be grand

299
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:09,452
Meet her
and give her my regards.

300
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:13,027
Stay here and sing her
a song

301
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:19,192
Find an inspiration for your
poetry. I'II see the dance

302
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,064
''I've faIIen in Iove
with someone''

303
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:38,005
''I've faIIen in Iove
and I feeI the restIessness''

304
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:01,461
''I had hoped
to conceaI the sorrow''

305
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:04,767
''But the secret
has been reveaIed''

306
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:18,783
''Look at what my heart has done.
O beIoved, my heart beats fast''

307
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:42,139
''My eyes have reveaIed
what I hoped to conceaI''

308
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,807
''What I wanted to teII you
remains hidden in my heart''

309
00:47:07,238 --> 00:47:10,503
''In our gIance, unspoken
words were expressed''

310
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:14,273
''My heart teIIs you,
I am aII yours''

311
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:28,014
''O what have you done, beIoved ?
My heart beats faster''

312
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:02,888
To go on Iike a parrot, do
you know what you are singing ?

313
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:07,229
You think I don't ?

314
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,163
But I understand

315
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:17,296
Everything ?
- Yes

316
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:21,675
Look into my eyes and
teII me what you see

317
00:48:33,958 --> 00:48:35,323
I see myseIf

318
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,088
Look ! you can see me in them.

319
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:41,925
See for yourseIf.
Can't you see me ?

320
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,425
Something eIse ?

321
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:46,935
The river

322
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,180
The water here is deep bIue.
- Because the river is deep

323
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:09,353
Just Iike your eyes

324
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:19,960
Even you've started composing
poetry, you're reaIIy in Iove

325
00:49:21,172 --> 00:49:22,799
But what is Iove

326
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,305
What is Iove ?
- Yes

327
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:31,713
Don't you know ?

328
00:49:33,618 --> 00:49:37,247
You said you know everything.
- I don't understand this

329
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:41,316
That is why I am
asking you to expIain

330
00:49:42,827 --> 00:49:47,321
Love isn't something one expIains,
it's something one obtains

331
00:49:49,033 --> 00:49:51,831
Love can onIy be feIt.
- How ?

332
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:59,833
Love wiII make itseIf feIt
Iike a thorn prick

333
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:02,441
When wiII it ?
- It's unpredictabIe

334
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:05,707
It appears suddenIy Iike
a fIower out of season

335
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:09,413
Then you know
what happens ?

336
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:13,688
Everything feeIs new

337
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,856
In someone's eyes,
you'II see a river

338
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:21,190
You'II feeI
Iike drowning in it

339
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,528
The moon is Iike a bridaI
mark

340
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:29,471
The sky's tears and
dew-drops

341
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:32,905
MoonIight faIIs on
the dust of the feet

342
00:51:36,273 --> 00:51:43,111
''Someone is on my mind.
Someone is here to stay''

343
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:52,114
''I cannot sIeep at night.
What shaII I do ?''

344
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:51,177
''When the stars smiIe
at night''

345
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,622
''SIeep vanishes from my eyes''

346
00:53:04,295 --> 00:53:14,000
''I sigh ever so quietIy,
O what shaII I do ?''

347
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:25,541
What overcomes you ?

348
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,212
When you Iaugh
you end up crying

349
00:53:30,688 --> 00:53:36,820
I was singing your song. On this
happy occasion, you're sad

350
00:53:40,164 --> 00:53:42,894
There's no Iife without
Iaughter and tears

351
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:47,396
These joys and sorrows
for the design of Iove

352
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:53,365
Your kind of Iove has
tears from the very start

353
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:58,148
Without tears,
reaI Iove doesn't exist

354
00:54:00,284 --> 00:54:01,581
Look !

355
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,655
SmiIing fIowers,
crying dew-drops

356
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:09,922
The combination of beauty
and Iove is beautifuI

357
00:54:11,295 --> 00:54:13,490
That happens when you
Iove

358
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:17,796
That is why Iove is
measured not in terms of time ...

359
00:54:19,103 --> 00:54:21,003
But in terms of Ionging

360
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,549
''Your sparkIing eyes.
Your sIender waist''

361
00:56:49,853 --> 00:56:55,814
''You're in the prime of Iife.
What do you Iack, teII me ?''

362
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:10,095
''Come to me, sweet Iove,
I shaII abide in your heart''

363
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:38,459
''In the intoxicating
breeze I swirI and kiss the buds''

364
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:51,347
''Like a wounded deer, when
we're apart, I seek you everywhere''

365
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:54,483
''My Iife is Iike
a wondrous journey''

366
00:58:32,823 --> 00:58:39,058
''I can't stop my eyes from
crying despite a hundred pIeas''

367
00:58:55,279 --> 00:59:01,309
''I'm the fIowing river
that fIirts with the shore''

368
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:10,818
''I fIow on to new cities
and to new pIaces''

369
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:21,966
''Come to me, sweet Iove,
I shaII abide in your heart''

370
01:00:02,312 --> 01:00:06,271
At night, you sit Iike a music
teacher with your instruments

371
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:08,110
What's wrong ?

372
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:10,777
What has happened to you ?

373
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:15,887
You're asking
such a difficuIt question

374
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:19,619
Not even the poet GhaIib
couId answer

375
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:24,797
That is why he said : O innocent
heart, what has befaIIen you ...

376
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:26,367
Is there no remedy

377
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:29,539
I am tired of hearing
about your heart-ache

378
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:32,366
Why are poets so pained ?

379
01:00:32,576 --> 01:00:33,804
Forever grieving

380
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:35,976
It's a secret

381
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,641
How wouId you know ?

382
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:42,443
O Iord, you have created
strange creatures caIIed poets ...

383
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:44,813
Who suffer some torment

384
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:50,524
If you want to Iive
in this worId, be happy

385
01:00:51,595 --> 01:00:56,498
Life is the name of Iaughter
that dazzIes Iike a firecracker

386
01:00:57,701 --> 01:01:02,661
That's the difference between us.
You onIy see the sparkIe

387
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:08,144
You don't see, that to Iight
the sparkIer you require fire

388
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:12,513
At every step, you can
find a new woman

389
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:17,851
You forget the girI
who Iongs for you

390
01:01:18,622 --> 01:01:21,591
Whatever you say, it seems
as if you're on her side

391
01:01:22,526 --> 01:01:28,226
I Iike your poetic
expression of sympathy

392
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:32,299
Bravo ! Today, you're
taking it IightIy, GopaI

393
01:01:34,004 --> 01:01:36,700
If her Iove is sincere ...

394
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:40,704
... and when those
other women desert you

395
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:44,441
You'II be at her feet

396
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:00,893
Who has LiIy gone with ?
- Her friend

397
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:05,726
Where is Ruby ?
- You mean that dancer ?

398
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:07,727
Gone with a friend

399
01:02:13,176 --> 01:02:16,475
''And when those
other women desert you''

400
01:02:17,314 --> 01:02:20,340
''You'II be at her feet''

401
01:02:29,026 --> 01:02:31,756
I'm sorry, I have
no time I'm going out

402
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:05,194
I am feeIing
terribIy upset

403
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:12,058
Something teIIs me, he isn't
weII and he's thinking of me

404
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:16,203
He must be making fun
of you, not thinking of you

405
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:20,467
Either way he thinks of me.
Why wouIn't he mock you ?

406
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:25,609
You're crazy. How can
you trust strangers ?

407
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:28,147
He must be having fun

408
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:29,977
And you Iong for him

409
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:32,653
No, I'm sure
something is wrong

410
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:36,215
When I sIeep,
I have nightmares

411
01:03:37,794 --> 01:03:41,321
I see him Iying iII
and caIIing out to me

412
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:46,234
At such time, he needs
someone to Iook after him

413
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:52,130
I don't need anyone,
I have never sought heIp

414
01:03:52,776 --> 01:03:56,143
Not even in Love.
So I don't get hurt

415
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,511
And I can die Iaughing

416
01:04:00,384 --> 01:04:02,113
A man can die Iaughing

417
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,413
But weeps at another's death

418
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:08,056
A man who can
Iaugh at his own death ...

419
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,692
can do it for others

420
01:04:11,328 --> 01:04:14,297
In this worId you suffer
death before you die

421
01:04:15,098 --> 01:04:18,192
In those painfuI moments
you need someone

422
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:21,864
Then you reaIise
the vaIue of true Iove

423
01:04:23,707 --> 01:04:25,868
I'm surprised
you don't know this

424
01:04:26,143 --> 01:04:27,610
I have Iearnt something

425
01:04:29,246 --> 01:04:31,339
That a girI's Iove
is worthIess

426
01:04:32,716 --> 01:04:36,675
Since this is your first
Iove, you taIk so phiIosophicaIIy

427
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:40,948
I can teII from experience
the strength of Iove

428
01:04:41,992 --> 01:04:44,358
A father's bIow
can queII the fIame

429
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:47,561
If the famiIy hears,
it means scandaI

430
01:04:47,998 --> 01:04:52,367
There are severaI
obstacIes that hinder Iove

431
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:55,730
You, too, wiII find out

432
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:58,566
Let the entire famiIy
get in the way

433
01:05:00,877 --> 01:05:02,401
CaII her in, she must
be cursing me

434
01:05:33,143 --> 01:05:34,940
Why is the
bread Iike this ?

435
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:39,775
May be the fIame was too high.
Throw away the burnt portions.

436
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:41,677
Is this burnt ?

437
01:05:44,988 --> 01:05:46,353
I forgot, mother

438
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:51,760
This isn't the first time.
Something is troubIing you

439
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:54,555
Why don't you
teII me what it is ?

440
01:05:54,998 --> 01:05:55,965
Nothing

441
01:06:01,004 --> 01:06:03,973
He's forever pIaying.
I can't hear

442
01:06:04,174 --> 01:06:08,406
He pIays the sitar so weII,
nothing appeaIs to you

443
01:06:08,612 --> 01:06:10,239
It sounds awfuI

444
01:06:10,447 --> 01:06:11,812
What's worrying you ?

445
01:06:12,015 --> 01:06:15,143
I toId you it's
nothing. PIease eat

446
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:16,986
I know everything

447
01:06:17,187 --> 01:06:19,587
Your father wiII
come tomorrow

448
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:22,383
And he wiII arrange
your marriage soon

449
01:06:41,044 --> 01:06:44,013
What do you gain
by making someone suffer ?

450
01:06:44,214 --> 01:06:45,841
Who's suffering,
you or me ?

451
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:50,516
Ask your sitar. It does
not give me a second's peace

452
01:06:53,356 --> 01:06:54,653
What is it ?

453
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:58,857
I don't know what,
but it says something

454
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:03,466
ReaIIy ? What
does it say ?

455
01:07:04,668 --> 01:07:08,195
I can't teII you, but
it definiteIy says something

456
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:11,234
I don't know
the Ianguage

457
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:17,539
I feeI as if there's someone
inside me who understands

458
01:07:19,082 --> 01:07:20,709
Which song is this ?

459
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:25,378
It's an EngIish song,
I once heard at a cIub

460
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:28,320
Do you Iike it ?

461
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:30,320
What do you Iike ?

462
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:34,894
Your sitar ?
- It isn't a sitar, it's a vioIin

463
01:07:40,637 --> 01:07:43,731
Do you know, tomorrow
my father is returning ?

464
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:49,078
That means you won't come here.
- Why ?

465
01:07:49,946 --> 01:07:53,074
Because ...
- You don't trust anybody

466
01:07:53,283 --> 01:07:55,581
In Iove you
trust each other

467
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:59,088
Or eIse, a waII of
doubt is created

468
01:07:59,723 --> 01:08:02,089
I don't understand
what you are saying

469
01:08:08,732 --> 01:08:12,361
I do, but you don't
see what I have to say

470
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:16,097
My mother was saying ...
- What ?

471
01:08:16,406 --> 01:08:19,933
She said when my
father comes tomorrow ...

472
01:08:21,144 --> 01:08:23,112
My marriage wiII be settIed

473
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:27,846
Your marriage ?
That's good

474
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:30,450
If I'm here, I'II watch
the bridaI procession

475
01:08:30,654 --> 01:08:33,555
I'II pIay this sitar
at your wedding

476
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:38,985
At our wedding, a shehnai
is pIayed, not a sitar

477
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:43,663
If you pIay the shehnai
this is of no use.

478
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:47,496
Why don't you understand ?
- What ?

479
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:54,910
That my father ...
Your ...

480
01:09:55,505 --> 01:10:08,817
''Those who Iive
in the reaIm of Iove''

481
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:25,695
''Those who Iaugh
and mock themseIves''

482
01:10:28,204 --> 01:10:32,231
''Love can make you Iaugh''

483
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:36,312
''Love can make you cry''

484
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:42,240
''Love can unite you''

485
01:10:44,087 --> 01:10:50,253
''Love can separate you''

486
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,925
Who is singing ?

487
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:55,059
Someone who is heart-broken

488
01:10:55,965 --> 01:10:57,262
Whose heart is broken ?

489
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,431
You warn others
when they are in Iove

490
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:04,773
But you have been
cheated in Iove

491
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:09,105
Do you understand ?

492
01:12:02,632 --> 01:12:04,793
O God, it's so
coId today

493
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:09,331
Your bed is ready.

494
01:12:09,539 --> 01:12:10,938
Go earIy to bed

495
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:13,700
Let me finish smoking

496
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:27,180
Reshma cares so much for me.
- After aII, she's your daughter

497
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:31,351
What wiII happen to us
if she gets married ?

498
01:12:31,794 --> 01:12:35,628
Have you settIed
her marriage ?

499
01:12:35,899 --> 01:12:40,927
I've much to teII you.
First Iet me finish smoking

500
01:12:41,938 --> 01:12:44,964
We have received
a good proposaI

501
01:14:10,059 --> 01:14:13,028
Don't worry, father,
it's me

502
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:14,196
What is it ?

503
01:14:14,364 --> 01:14:17,060
I want to drink some water

504
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:24,029
It's so coId

505
01:14:53,336 --> 01:14:56,032
What is the matter,
Reshma ?

506
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:58,234
Nothing, father

507
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,236
You said it's coId,

508
01:15:01,044 --> 01:15:02,671
I want to cover you

509
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:10,685
Now go to sIeep

510
01:16:18,521 --> 01:16:20,921
Stop pIaying, I'm here

511
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,988
You are in my arms
Iike a vioIin

512
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,327
I feeI Iike stirring your
heart so you wiII trembIe

513
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:33,864
The strings of my heart
vibrate aIready

514
01:16:35,805 --> 01:16:37,773
You can't hear
the sound

515
01:16:39,842 --> 01:16:41,742
Fake reIief is useIess

516
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:48,339
If you've moved, wouId I injure
my fingers on these strings ?

517
01:16:54,457 --> 01:16:55,754
What have you done ?

518
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:00,886
You don't trust me

519
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:08,796
Like Heer SayaI

520
01:17:09,805 --> 01:17:10,772
Heer SayaI ?

521
01:17:14,243 --> 01:17:18,907
She was the woman in a pair
of Iegendary Iovers of Punjab

522
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:22,515
How can I be compared to her ?

523
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:30,819
Heer deceived the King who gave
up his throne to marry her

524
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:34,426
Who was the other coupIe ?
- Sohni MahiwaI.

525
01:17:39,702 --> 01:17:41,465
She was true to her Iover

526
01:17:42,872 --> 01:17:47,002
She wouId cross the river
with the heIp of a cIay pot ...

527
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:49,542
... every midnight
to meet MahiwaI

528
01:17:51,514 --> 01:17:55,473
Inspite of knowing
the pot was unbaked ...

529
01:17:55,718 --> 01:17:58,152
... and wouId easiIy
dissoIve in water

530
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:01,082
She waded into river

531
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,485
So their Iove wouIdn't
be tainted

532
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:08,697
So what if there
was a Sohni ...

533
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,026
Most girIs prove to
be Iike Heer

534
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:17,361
GopaI may be right

535
01:18:17,907 --> 01:18:21,274
It takes time
to find out who is true

536
01:18:25,548 --> 01:18:27,948
If a man is true he has
to go through many orderaIs

537
01:18:29,118 --> 01:18:32,554
Those who wait for
an opportune time, wiII Iose

538
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:36,550
Time does not
wait for anyone

539
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:40,729
Time moves at
its own pace

540
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:44,564
It doesn't stand stiII ever,
no matter how fine the moment

541
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:22,102
However beautifuI riches
and weaIth are ...

542
01:19:22,305 --> 01:19:35,446
... there's nothing in this
worId more beautifuI than honour

543
01:19:36,152 --> 01:19:39,610
Every poor person
shouId keep it in mind

544
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:43,189
This is the onIy treasure ...

545
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:46,590
... by which he can
hoId his head high

546
01:19:50,232 --> 01:19:51,927
Why did you say this ?

547
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:57,564
You're to marry someone
from the next viIIage

548
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:10,815
Before a daughter gets married,
it is every father's duty ...

549
01:20:11,187 --> 01:20:16,022
... to teII her, in the form of
advice, of Iife's experience

550
01:20:17,026 --> 01:20:18,994
That is reaI dowry

551
01:20:19,762 --> 01:20:22,128
I've seen much of this worId

552
01:20:22,965 --> 01:20:25,661
I've served many guests
in this house

553
01:20:26,769 --> 01:20:30,728
They've trapped girIs with
faIse promises and ruined them

554
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:36,675
It's the same story each year,
and I've seen the girIs dying

555
01:20:36,879 --> 01:20:40,508
I've never seen even
an outsider return

556
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:47,119
''Heer deceived the King who
gave up his throne to marry her''

557
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:48,906
''Today, you, too,
have become Heer SayaI''

558
01:21:55,024 --> 01:21:56,992
''I wiII be Iike Sohni''

559
01:22:22,451 --> 01:22:26,751
''Inspite of knowing the
pot was unbaked ...''

560
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:29,787
''... and wouId easiIy
dissoIve in water''

561
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:34,554
''She waded into the river
so their Iove wouIdn't be tainted''

562
01:22:34,864 --> 01:22:37,298
I wiII be Iike Sohni

563
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:20,606
Reshma, come back !

564
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:26,613
I'm caught in the current,
I cannot come back

565
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:30,340
Come back, Reshma !

566
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:41,291
You wiII ruin
our name, our honour

567
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,037
I'II kiII you

568
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:11,737
You can't compeI
us to Ieave

569
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:14,076
We've paid for
the whoIe season

570
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:17,079
Cash

571
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:22,220
Even if you return the money,
you can't break the contract

572
01:25:22,456 --> 01:25:26,825
You can't ask us
to go whenever you Iike

573
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:36,435
It's no use quarreIIing, GopaI,
we'II Ieave this pIace and go

574
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:40,105
We'II move right away

575
01:25:40,274 --> 01:25:42,902
Whatever he's done
or is doing is right

576
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:45,038
He doesn't mean it

577
01:25:46,881 --> 01:25:50,442
In our country many act
Iike that, for sham respect

578
01:25:52,486 --> 01:25:55,114
They don't know true Iove

579
01:25:58,059 --> 01:26:02,189
You shouId have asked me once,
what kind of Iove mine was

580
01:26:03,364 --> 01:26:07,733
You've met those who've made
faIse promises and hated them

581
01:26:10,504 --> 01:26:13,405
At Ieast one must have
proved true

582
01:26:14,508 --> 01:26:19,070
The fIower you nurtured
with your hands, didn't ...

583
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:22,747
... your souI cry out when
they threw it in the water

584
01:26:24,285 --> 01:26:27,686
Ask this water, if she wasn't
pure Iike the Ganges

585
01:29:45,719 --> 01:29:47,277
Doctor !
- What ?

586
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:50,087
What brought you here
so earIy ?

587
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:53,084
I want you to come
with me, quickIy

588
01:29:54,428 --> 01:29:55,690
At Ieast, stand up

589
01:30:11,912 --> 01:30:13,880
Is she stiII aIive ?
- Yes

590
01:30:14,815 --> 01:30:20,310
Get eight or ten fIowers from
Panchavati and come back soon

591
01:30:21,755 --> 01:30:24,121
Remember to get them
from a big tree

592
01:30:45,446 --> 01:30:49,143
I have finished appIying it.
Take good care of her.

593
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:52,152
When the paste dries,
appIy some more

594
01:30:57,524 --> 01:30:58,923
HeIp me wash my hands

595
01:31:05,745 --> 01:31:07,975
How can you Ieave her
in this state ?

596
01:31:08,314 --> 01:31:11,613
I've to perform a marriage,
It's an auspicious time

597
01:31:15,121 --> 01:31:21,959
Nagina's marriage ?
Doctor

598
01:31:22,361 --> 01:31:23,794
What is it ?

599
01:31:25,832 --> 01:31:26,992
My marriage ?

600
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,462
WiII it never happen ?

601
01:31:30,336 --> 01:31:33,794
Who wiII marry you and
get their bones powdered ?

602
01:31:35,374 --> 01:31:40,641
Let me get engaged now,
if I can't get married

603
01:31:41,347 --> 01:31:42,974
Wait a IittIe Ionger

604
01:31:43,249 --> 01:31:47,151
God wiII send someone for you,
through the roof

605
01:31:47,487 --> 01:31:52,550
What does it matter, even if
she arrives in water ?

606
01:31:52,758 --> 01:31:54,225
He'II send someone

607
01:31:54,794 --> 01:31:58,525
When wiII she recover ?
- In fifteen or twenty days

608
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:05,670
We need God's heIp. He sent me
a bride in the fIowing river

609
01:32:05,872 --> 01:32:09,672
It is said that when
God gives, he gives abundantIy

610
01:32:10,042 --> 01:32:12,840
But today you have been
overwheImed

611
01:32:13,713 --> 01:32:15,681
Isn't she beautifuI ?

612
01:32:16,883 --> 01:32:19,181
It is a question
of Iuck

613
01:32:19,619 --> 01:32:23,111
I remember a story where
he brought a fairy of Kohkaf

614
01:32:25,424 --> 01:32:26,857
Take this water, Doctor

615
01:32:32,899 --> 01:32:35,265
Can you hear ?
It's raining.

616
01:32:35,735 --> 01:32:38,704
The doctor said, you'II
have new Iife in you

617
01:32:38,905 --> 01:32:41,567
You'II be perfectIy weII

618
01:32:41,774 --> 01:32:44,106
Look ! I've brought
you some fresh fruit

619
01:32:44,343 --> 01:32:48,541
I have picked them myseIf.
Take these fIowers, too

620
01:32:55,188 --> 01:32:59,625
You caIIed me sir,
my name is BhoIu

621
01:33:02,528 --> 01:33:07,295
CaII me BhoIu, not sir

622
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:12,062
Look outside, there are new
Ieaves. Let's watch the rain

623
01:33:35,962 --> 01:33:40,922
Look ! The monsoons are here
and the new Ieaves, too

624
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,665
But he hasn't come

625
01:33:43,869 --> 01:33:48,772
Don't teII me about him. Do any
traveIIers keep their promises ?

626
01:33:48,975 --> 01:33:52,001
He promised me, he wouId
be here with the rain

627
01:33:52,211 --> 01:33:57,706
You stupid girI, whoever comes
in the rains never stays

628
01:33:58,551 --> 01:34:02,783
The rivers that are so
turbuIent in this season ...

629
01:34:02,989 --> 01:34:04,786
are stiII Iater

630
01:34:05,658 --> 01:34:09,617
You cannot depend on promises
made in the rainy season

631
01:34:09,829 --> 01:34:11,296
Look there, he's come

632
01:34:22,742 --> 01:34:24,573
Was that your friend ?

633
01:34:34,854 --> 01:34:38,984
''In Iife I've spent Iong
years in grief''

634
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:48,658
''I've spent Iong years
in restIessness''

635
01:35:03,716 --> 01:35:07,675
''The Iight of hope hasn't
shone, my heart is in darkness''

636
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:17,024
''I've never had someone
to caII a Iife companion''

637
01:35:22,168 --> 01:35:28,630
''For whom shaII
I continue Iiving''

638
01:35:47,793 --> 01:35:52,059
''The worId mocks me.
The worId Iaughs at my state''

639
01:35:57,103 --> 01:36:01,403
''None have cared to know
what grieves me''

640
01:36:06,379 --> 01:36:13,080
''I've wondered
with an unexpressed Iove''

641
01:36:31,704 --> 01:36:35,731
''I've not known
the intoxication of passion.''

642
01:36:40,846 --> 01:36:45,112
''My tears even overwheIm
the monsoon cIouds''

643
01:36:50,089 --> 01:36:56,517
''In the waves of sorrow
I've Iived, I've fIoated''

644
01:37:19,185 --> 01:37:22,416
Can the marriage
be performed shortIy ?

645
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:28,320
I warn you. Getting married
is an expensive business

646
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:34,688
For a marriage I charge three
rupees, eIeven and a haIf annas

647
01:37:36,969 --> 01:37:38,937
You have to buy whatever
is needed for the ceremony

648
01:37:40,806 --> 01:37:45,334
The bride needs many things.
You'II have to purchase them.

649
01:37:45,544 --> 01:37:49,036
TeII me what I shouId get.
You've been married five times

650
01:37:49,248 --> 01:37:50,715
You shouId know

651
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:55,951
I'II teII you, but you'II
have to go to the city

652
01:37:56,155 --> 01:37:59,556
Then Doctor, why don't
you teII me quickIy ?

653
01:37:59,758 --> 01:38:01,783
She's Iooks very forIorn

654
01:38:02,161 --> 01:38:03,924
Whom do you mean ?
The bridge ?

655
01:39:20,906 --> 01:39:22,203
You've returned ?

656
01:39:23,642 --> 01:39:25,872
Where is Babuji ?
- Which Babuji ?

657
01:39:26,412 --> 01:39:29,472
My Babuji who has sent
you to fetch me

658
01:39:30,316 --> 01:39:33,581
I impIore you, pIease
take me back to my Babuji

659
01:39:33,786 --> 01:39:37,552
Or eIse, the deviI who
wants to marry me wiII kiII me

660
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:40,290
Take me to my Babuji

661
01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:45,023
I forgot that Babuji had
sent me to coIIect you

662
01:39:45,230 --> 01:39:48,199
Your Babuji sent me.
Come in, sit at the back

663
01:39:50,703 --> 01:39:52,295
You're going to Babuji

664
01:39:53,706 --> 01:39:54,968
Let's go quickIy

665
01:40:08,287 --> 01:40:11,381
Where are you taking her ?
- She wants to join Babuji

666
01:40:15,628 --> 01:40:18,495
Leave him. He has come
to take me to Babuji

667
01:40:19,031 --> 01:40:21,158
Who is Babuji ? I'II thrash
you untiI I break your bones

668
01:40:35,047 --> 01:40:40,508
I'm warning you, if you go
out, I'II beat you to puIp

669
01:41:03,842 --> 01:41:06,709
''Who wiII stand by me ?''

670
01:41:23,762 --> 01:41:32,136
''O beIoved do not forget me.
Who wiII stand by me ?''

671
01:41:52,124 --> 01:41:57,152
''We're separated.
I'm far, far away from you''

672
01:41:58,897 --> 01:42:02,025
''I'm hindered from meeting you''

673
01:42:10,309 --> 01:42:15,269
''My weeping heart beckons
you ...''

674
01:42:16,048 --> 01:42:18,448
''Who wiII stand by me ?''

675
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:43,098
''I yearn to meet you again''

676
01:42:45,511 --> 01:42:48,480
''My eyes thirst to see you''

677
01:42:56,855 --> 01:43:00,814
''Even the sorrow you bear
is precious to me''

678
01:43:25,584 --> 01:43:29,179
''If I had wings
I wouId fIy to you''

679
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:34,516
''But how shaII I come
to you ?''

680
01:43:42,568 --> 01:43:47,870
''The force of destiny
has rendered me heIpIess''

681
01:44:59,578 --> 01:45:01,102
Reshma, where are you ?

682
01:45:02,814 --> 01:45:05,009
You toId me you didn't
understand anything

683
01:45:06,585 --> 01:45:09,554
Then how did you Iearn
to sacrifice your Iife ?

684
01:45:10,589 --> 01:45:13,353
Where did you Iearn
to do that ?

685
01:45:13,725 --> 01:45:16,216
If you had to go, why
didn't you take me ?

686
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,033
I'II take you

687
01:45:42,287 --> 01:45:44,255
Why must I go there ?

688
01:45:45,624 --> 01:45:47,319
I don't Iike the roads

689
01:45:47,526 --> 01:45:53,487
Can't you do that much for
a friend ? Come with me

690
01:45:53,732 --> 01:45:55,029
In that case, I won't go

691
01:45:55,167 --> 01:45:56,657
Don't forgive me, GopaI

692
01:45:59,972 --> 01:46:02,338
Listen to me
- I don't want to hear

693
01:46:02,708 --> 01:46:05,404
If you feeI for me,
then give me my things

694
01:46:08,447 --> 01:46:12,406
Where eIse wiII I go ?
- I'II take you to the city

695
01:46:12,718 --> 01:46:17,155
I beg you, take me at
Ieast once to the city

696
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:19,590
My Babuji wiII reward you

697
01:46:19,791 --> 01:46:22,521
What can he give me ?
It's God who has ...

698
01:46:22,728 --> 01:46:26,357
... granted me with
a bride Iike you

699
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,365
You're embarrassed !

700
01:46:32,904 --> 01:46:35,930
The auspicious time for
our marriage is in four days

701
01:46:36,174 --> 01:46:47,210
I'II buy you cIothes
and bangIes. Anything you Iike

702
01:47:57,656 --> 01:47:59,954
I've brought him
with difficuIty

703
01:48:06,665 --> 01:48:10,066
What coIour wouId you Iike ?
- Ask her

704
01:48:10,769 --> 01:48:13,636
Show my queen bangIes
for her marriage

705
01:48:43,869 --> 01:48:46,030
Won't you dance today ?

706
01:48:48,006 --> 01:48:48,973
No, I won't

707
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:53,237
Even if you don't want to
dance, come to cIub this evening

708
01:48:56,548 --> 01:48:57,845
WiII you wear these ?

709
01:49:51,002 --> 01:49:52,731
''Which song are you pIaying ?''

710
01:49:53,104 --> 01:49:57,905
''It's an EngIish song I once
heard at cIub. Do you Iike it ?''

711
01:49:58,210 --> 01:49:59,404
''I Iike the way you pIay''

712
01:51:59,764 --> 01:52:01,629
Where's my Babuji ?
- Which Babuji ?

713
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:04,025
That was his song

714
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:12,940
This is his sitar. You're
pIaying my Babuji's sitar

715
01:52:13,678 --> 01:52:15,908
If you know,
teII me where he is

716
01:52:17,716 --> 01:52:20,879
You must know, how eIse
couId you pIay this song ?

717
01:52:21,186 --> 01:52:25,816
You must know. Or eIse,
where did you Iearn this tune ?

718
01:52:26,024 --> 01:52:28,322
I beg you, pIease teII me
where my Babuji is

719
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,268
Hand her over to the poIice

720
01:52:37,836 --> 01:52:41,738
I'II take her away

721
01:52:42,941 --> 01:52:44,568
Don't say anything
to her. She's mad

722
01:52:48,847 --> 01:52:52,806
Wretched woman,
you've tainted my honour

723
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:55,086
You know whose bride
you'II be ?

724
01:54:15,967 --> 01:54:25,171
''My beIoved has Ieft me.
My beIoved has abandoned me.''

725
01:54:33,051 --> 01:54:36,612
''My Iove has broken a
heart fiIIing with Iove''

726
01:54:48,233 --> 01:54:58,199
''We're no Ionger together.
We're now apart''

727
01:55:16,661 --> 01:55:23,225
''The buds smiIe as
they bIossom into fIowers''

728
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:40,846
''When I see the cIouds
gather, my eyes fiII with tears''

729
01:56:13,618 --> 01:56:20,285
''Who knows the whims of Iove,
OnIy I do, my heart does''

730
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:37,505
''When my eyes cIose;
I see memories dance''

731
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:16,505
''The heart was first set
abIaze, then came the rain''

732
01:57:28,393 --> 01:57:37,700
''Such is the fury of seperation.
I am forever restIess''

733
01:57:42,407 --> 01:57:48,539
''My Iove has broken a
heart fiIIed with Iove''

734
01:57:49,247 --> 01:57:59,384
''My beIoved has Ieft me.
My beIoved has abandoned me.''

735
01:58:08,733 --> 01:58:11,702
It seems as if you'II Iose
your mind

736
01:58:15,606 --> 01:58:17,801
I wonder why it's taken
so Iong

737
01:58:19,377 --> 01:58:21,777
It shouId have
happened Iong ago

738
01:58:21,979 --> 01:58:24,004
Are you insane or am I ?

739
01:58:24,182 --> 01:58:25,149
What is it ...

740
01:58:25,349 --> 01:58:28,250
... that torments me ?
Is this Iove ?

741
01:58:43,634 --> 01:58:47,934
I don't understand anything.
I can no Ionger think

742
01:58:49,607 --> 01:58:55,671
If Iove is onIy physicaI, how
can it be so strong after death ?

743
01:58:57,381 --> 01:59:00,441
Your beIief is so strong,
that I wonder ...

744
01:59:00,818 --> 01:59:06,620
... if you may be right, and
that questions my convictions

745
01:59:07,558 --> 01:59:13,258
I get fed up with Iife and
become restIess Iike you

746
01:59:16,234 --> 01:59:17,724
Why must that be ?

747
01:59:19,904 --> 01:59:21,201
It isn't new

748
01:59:23,107 --> 01:59:25,473
PeopIe have spIit emotions

749
01:59:26,010 --> 01:59:28,478
Which are in opposition
to one another

750
01:59:30,515 --> 01:59:33,484
There are times
when I Iook at you and ...

751
01:59:33,684 --> 01:59:35,311
You are my other side

752
01:59:35,553 --> 01:59:38,488
That's right.
That's what I've thought, too

753
01:59:39,357 --> 01:59:42,485
Does it mean that as we
are two sides of one person ...

754
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:46,489
... and if we were to Iove
the same girI ...

755
01:59:46,697 --> 01:59:48,665
... wouId that create
true Iove ?

756
01:59:51,369 --> 01:59:53,997
You amuse me,
I accept your argument.

757
01:59:54,305 --> 01:59:55,602
Let's go.
- Where

758
01:59:55,807 --> 01:59:57,707
We'II Iove the same girI

759
01:59:57,909 --> 02:00:00,070
You make me Iaugh

760
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:04,680
That's nothing. Today,
you'II come with me for a waIk

761
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:07,349
Where to ?
- Wherever I Iike

762
02:00:18,663 --> 02:00:21,359
Where are you taking me ?
- ShaII I teII you ?

763
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,100
I want to prove, you can buy
the Iove you consider priceIess

764
02:00:28,005 --> 02:00:30,303
SiIver coins can buy anything

765
02:00:31,576 --> 02:00:34,977
You do not understand
the meaning of Iove

766
02:00:35,179 --> 02:00:37,875
You seem to.
That's why you're going crazy

767
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:47,457
No, GopaI

768
02:00:50,328 --> 02:00:53,297
For God's sake,
Iet's go

769
02:00:56,601 --> 02:00:57,966
Where are we going ?

770
02:00:58,536 --> 02:01:01,903
UnIess we find a pIace where
I see the truth I wanted ...

771
02:01:02,106 --> 02:01:05,564
... to show you,
we won't go back

772
02:01:22,026 --> 02:01:26,986
You're stiII not ready
for the wedding. Hurry !

773
02:01:34,138 --> 02:01:36,003
Perform the marriage quickIy.
Why are you deIaying ?

774
02:01:51,656 --> 02:01:53,283
A tribaI's marriage

775
02:01:53,824 --> 02:01:55,792
Let's see the ceremony

776
02:01:57,428 --> 02:02:02,127
''If I'm here, I'II watch
the bridaI procession''

777
02:02:02,466 --> 02:02:04,764
''I'II pIay this sitar
at your marriage''

778
02:02:07,505 --> 02:02:12,636
''At our weddings a shehnai
is pIayed not a sitar''

779
02:02:14,946 --> 02:02:16,846
''For your wedding,
a shehnai wiII pIay''

780
02:02:22,687 --> 02:02:23,984
Let's go away

781
02:02:26,223 --> 02:02:28,191
I don't Iike marriage music

782
02:02:35,433 --> 02:02:37,458
A ''shehnai'' wouId have been
pIayed at her wedding

783
02:02:43,274 --> 02:02:47,677
Where shaII we go ?
- Far from the music of a ''shehnai''

784
02:02:48,212 --> 02:02:50,271
To see a girI ?
- To any heII ...

785
02:02:51,649 --> 02:02:53,139
Where we won't hear it

786
02:02:57,455 --> 02:02:59,150
Now you're taIking

787
02:03:19,043 --> 02:03:28,509
''O traveIIer,
return to me but once''

788
02:03:28,886 --> 02:03:34,518
''Once, we've exchanged gIances,
don't turn your gaze away''

789
02:03:45,269 --> 02:03:51,003
''You made promises,
you swore by me''

790
02:03:58,215 --> 02:04:03,915
''I Iive by your promises,
I wait in hope for you''

791
02:04:11,228 --> 02:04:23,436
''I impIore you,
never forget me''

792
02:04:37,254 --> 02:04:43,784
''The worId has taken you from me.
The worId surrounds me''

793
02:04:50,734 --> 02:04:56,104
''On my Iips
I utter onIy your name''

794
02:05:03,347 --> 02:05:12,654
''Don't make me weep,
that the worId mocks me''

795
02:05:29,807 --> 02:05:35,439
''Don't beIong to another
now as you beIong to me''

796
02:05:42,786 --> 02:05:48,190
''Now as you abide in my
heart, don't desert me''

797
02:05:58,836 --> 02:06:04,866
''Stand by your word and
the promises you've made''

798
02:06:14,919 --> 02:06:20,880
''O traveIIer,
return to me but once''

799
02:06:33,337 --> 02:06:39,503
You see Pran
buys and seIIs Iove

800
02:06:39,843 --> 02:06:44,746
I've Ieft the cigarattes
in the car. I'II fetch them.

801
02:06:53,891 --> 02:06:56,325
Why're you standing outside ?
Do come in

802
02:06:56,527 --> 02:06:57,926
Don't caII me Babuji

803
02:06:59,897 --> 02:07:00,921
My name is Pran

804
02:07:02,299 --> 02:07:04,096
How can I take your name ?

805
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:07,267
What eIse ?

806
02:07:07,471 --> 02:07:11,430
LovingIy, she caIIed
me Babuji, too

807
02:07:12,977 --> 02:07:14,103
Who was she ?

808
02:07:15,713 --> 02:07:17,203
Do you seII Iove ?

809
02:07:21,518 --> 02:07:23,952
Why ?
For money ?

810
02:07:31,562 --> 02:07:35,623
Why waste time taIking about
things that aren't important ?

811
02:07:36,133 --> 02:07:38,829
Come in. Let's taIk
of pIeasant things

812
02:08:01,825 --> 02:08:03,588
You need money for the chiId ?

813
02:08:07,298 --> 02:08:08,526
Who is its father ?

814
02:08:11,435 --> 02:08:16,566
He came here once, two years ago.
I haven't seen him since.

815
02:08:19,043 --> 02:08:20,601
The chiId is very iII

816
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:27,010
There isn't a singIe
dispensary around these parts

817
02:08:28,052 --> 02:08:30,179
I don't have money
for the doctor

818
02:08:30,954 --> 02:08:33,752
He is an important man's son
I fear that ...

819
02:08:33,957 --> 02:08:37,859
... if he comes, he'II accuse
me of negIecting his chiId.

820
02:09:29,780 --> 02:09:30,678
Let's go

821
02:09:30,848 --> 02:09:35,080
We'II go. First teII me how
the bargaining of Iove went

822
02:09:38,122 --> 02:09:41,580
She's a mother
- What ?

823
02:09:42,559 --> 02:09:45,892
Not a woman's Iove, but
a mother's Iove is being soId

824
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:49,828
You won't understand. You're
modern thinking

825
02:10:28,071 --> 02:10:30,631
You're going back ?

826
02:10:31,208 --> 02:10:34,939
Even after she's dead, you
return with hope. It's foIIy

827
02:10:35,712 --> 02:10:39,739
One cannot Iive by obstinacy.
Life compeIs you to move on

828
02:10:40,083 --> 02:10:42,711
I don't Iike you acting
Iike a T.B. patient

829
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:45,418
If you want to die,
commit suicide.

830
02:10:56,366 --> 02:10:59,767
CaII it Iove or friendship,
you're my weakness

831
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:01,528
I can't Ieave you

832
02:11:05,609 --> 02:11:07,907
If you want to die,
better commit suicide

833
02:11:11,315 --> 02:11:12,873
They're pIaying again

834
02:11:15,052 --> 02:11:16,349
Stop it !

835
02:11:39,743 --> 02:11:40,971
What's wrong ?

836
02:11:41,245 --> 02:11:44,703
The car has faIIen
into a ravine, hurry !

837
02:11:53,624 --> 02:11:56,593
Why are you Iooking at me ?
Hurry.

838
02:12:08,272 --> 02:12:11,400
I'II fetch a doctor from
the city. Take care of him.

839
02:12:12,209 --> 02:12:13,506
I'II reward you

840
02:12:23,687 --> 02:12:25,655
So much bIood !

841
02:12:27,024 --> 02:12:30,050
He's badIy injured.
He's paIe

842
02:12:31,228 --> 02:12:32,422
FeeI his puIse

843
02:12:34,197 --> 02:12:35,824
Is he aIive ?

844
02:12:36,233 --> 02:12:38,428
He's stiII Iiving,
but BhoIu ...

845
02:12:39,136 --> 02:12:40,660
Take the girI home

846
02:12:41,305 --> 02:12:46,265
Leave her. Remember
those Panchavati roots ...

847
02:12:47,311 --> 02:12:48,608
Lift him sIowIy

848
02:13:16,506 --> 02:13:18,133
Where are you, O traveIIer ?

849
02:13:19,009 --> 02:13:24,311
Come this way once, so that
I may see you before I die

850
02:14:11,194 --> 02:14:13,628
What has happened ?
What have you done to yourseIf ?

851
02:14:14,398 --> 02:14:21,668
Open your eyes ! TaIk to me,
Iook at me, I'm Reshma

852
02:14:21,872 --> 02:14:26,172
If you were upset
by my wedding, ...

853
02:14:26,410 --> 02:14:28,207
...why did you
pass that way ?

854
02:14:37,688 --> 02:14:41,055
You said you'd pIay the
sitar at my wedding

855
02:14:49,966 --> 02:14:52,400
I'II sing your song

856
02:14:57,574 --> 02:15:04,002
''Someone is on my mind,
Someone is here to stay''

857
02:15:08,118 --> 02:15:11,417
''I can't sIeep at night
what shaII I do ?''

858
02:15:37,114 --> 02:15:39,981
This is my Babuji

859
02:15:41,218 --> 02:15:44,051
I don't know what's happened,
he's badIy hurt

860
02:15:44,888 --> 02:15:47,789
He had come
to take me with him

861
02:15:50,894 --> 02:15:54,057
I'm gIad I know of him
before we married

862
02:15:54,264 --> 02:15:58,132
Perform the rites quicIy.
I'II throw the body in river

863
02:16:29,533 --> 02:16:30,898
Leave my Babuji aIone

864
02:16:40,944 --> 02:16:42,502
CaII the poIice

865
02:17:05,302 --> 02:17:09,534
If you don't Iisten,
I'II chop him in two.

866
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:01,216
Now I'm Iike Sohni

867
02:18:33,590 --> 02:18:35,023
You can go back home

868
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:37,126
Why ?

869
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:41,089
Aren't you pIeased now ?

870
02:18:41,665 --> 02:18:43,963
Why say ominous things ?

871
02:18:44,434 --> 02:18:48,131
What good omen is there ?
The doctors have given up hope

872
02:18:49,072 --> 02:18:51,040
They operate for
the heck of it

873
02:18:52,876 --> 02:18:54,366
He's as good as dead

874
02:18:56,346 --> 02:18:59,144
For the doctors, he dies
then itseIf

875
02:19:02,085 --> 02:19:04,053
He does not fear death

876
02:19:06,156 --> 02:19:08,317
OnIy Iove can fight death

877
02:19:10,627 --> 02:19:13,494
My Iove's so strong,
it snatched him from death

878
02:19:14,764 --> 02:19:18,393
A thousand deaths together
wiII not affect him

879
02:19:25,141 --> 02:19:26,506
Don't get upset

880
02:19:29,713 --> 02:19:34,844
Babuji cannot die
No, he can never die

881
02:19:58,975 --> 02:20:01,705
Your taIk wiII
drive me mad

882
02:20:02,245 --> 02:20:04,543
Go away. Pran wiII die.

883
02:20:04,748 --> 02:20:06,113
And I shaII cause
your death, too

884
02:20:06,316 --> 02:20:12,346
You won't need to kiII me.
My Iove wiII destroy me.

885
02:20:13,790 --> 02:20:19,729
He said, Iove can bring one
back to Iife, or take a Iife away

886
02:20:21,965 --> 02:20:27,733
Like me, trust in God.
He aIways saves Iove's honour

887
02:20:28,271 --> 02:20:32,731
I don't beIieve in God.
If Pran Iives, ...

888
02:20:33,343 --> 02:20:35,311
... I'II beIieve in
Iove's power

889
02:20:35,779 --> 02:20:37,212
And I'II worship you

890
02:20:52,195 --> 02:20:54,163
The operation is
successfuI. Pran wiII Iive.

891
02:21:32,435 --> 02:21:33,402
Look !

892
02:21:48,017 --> 02:21:51,453
What's aII this ?
- It's magic

893
02:21:56,793 --> 02:21:58,317
I'II teach you magic

894
02:22:03,032 --> 02:22:06,991
What use is it to me ?
I get my work done without magic

895
02:22:07,437 --> 02:22:09,132
Why don't you try and
understand, sister-in-Iaw ?

896
02:22:09,606 --> 02:22:15,010
The doctor said Pran's
bandages wiII be removed shortIy

897
02:22:15,712 --> 02:22:21,344
By then, I want to make
you into a Iady, a fine Iady

898
02:22:28,791 --> 02:22:29,758
A Iady ?

899
02:22:33,663 --> 02:22:35,688
I want to make you
into a Iady ...

900
02:22:35,899 --> 02:22:37,696
... so that when
Pran sees you ...

901
02:22:37,901 --> 02:22:39,698
watch what'II happen

902
02:22:39,903 --> 02:22:41,131
What ?

903
02:22:45,308 --> 02:22:46,639
He'II be thriIIed

904
02:22:46,809 --> 02:22:50,870
He'II be so happy that he
may give you to me as a reward

905
02:22:51,781 --> 02:22:53,180
Don't say that

906
02:22:58,855 --> 02:23:02,222
We haven't much time.
Let's begin with the first Iesson

907
02:23:03,726 --> 02:23:08,561
This is caIIed a sari.
This is how you wear it

908
02:23:09,732 --> 02:23:11,029
Something Iike this

909
02:23:12,735 --> 02:23:14,100
And this is powder

910
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,804
Lime !

911
02:23:18,007 --> 02:23:19,736
It isn't Iime, it's powder

912
02:23:21,611 --> 02:23:24,705
When you put powder
it makes your face white

913
02:23:29,786 --> 02:23:31,413
I don't see how
they use it

914
02:24:21,938 --> 02:24:24,463
Sister-in-Iaw,
you Iook IoveIy

915
02:24:25,008 --> 02:24:28,967
It's wonderfuI,
you've Iearnt so quickIy

916
02:24:29,178 --> 02:24:31,703
You must Iearn
how to speak

917
02:24:33,016 --> 02:24:36,816
If you Iearn a IittIe EngIish,
you'II be a reaI magician.

918
02:24:37,186 --> 02:24:40,155
Back to the same subject.
I refuse to Iearn

919
02:24:40,356 --> 02:24:42,824
You'II never get a
teacher Iike me

920
02:24:43,793 --> 02:24:49,322
When you're with him, don't
forget to think of me sometimes

921
02:24:50,033 --> 02:24:53,491
That won't happen
He said we'd stay together

922
02:24:53,703 --> 02:24:55,000
It's impossipIe

923
02:24:55,271 --> 02:24:57,705
Why ?
- I don't know how to teII you

924
02:24:58,441 --> 02:24:59,408
What did you do ?

925
02:24:59,609 --> 02:25:00,837
I do ?

926
02:25:01,044 --> 02:25:02,739
You've transformed me

927
02:25:04,447 --> 02:25:06,005
He couIdn't do it aIone

928
02:25:06,983 --> 02:25:09,543
Like a Goddess, you've charmed
him with Iove

929
02:25:10,953 --> 02:25:17,017
I thought Iove was madness,
now I want to become a discipIe

930
02:25:17,660 --> 02:25:19,821
ReaIIy ? TeII me who she is
same girI

931
02:25:20,063 --> 02:25:24,693
In these mountains,
there is a girI just Iike you

932
02:25:26,803 --> 02:25:29,363
Sit down. I'II teII you
her story

933
02:25:31,874 --> 02:25:35,833
Her name is NeeIa. On the
way here there is a settIement

934
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:40,643
During the monsoons Iast
year when Pran and I ...

935
02:25:41,184 --> 02:25:43,652
I've aIways made
faIse promises

936
02:25:46,756 --> 02:25:48,383
The poor girI pines
for me

937
02:25:49,992 --> 02:25:55,555
You've done wrong. You
don't know girIs of the mountains

938
02:25:57,166 --> 02:25:59,327
You make faIse promises
and go

939
02:26:00,937 --> 02:26:06,569
These poor girIs
spend their Iives together

940
02:26:08,111 --> 02:26:11,877
If they can't bear it,
they voice their pain in song

941
02:26:13,516 --> 02:26:15,780
So their songs are tormented

942
02:26:15,985 --> 02:26:18,283
That's why they are moving

943
02:26:19,122 --> 02:26:21,682
It meIted a stone-hearted
person Iike me

944
02:26:24,127 --> 02:26:27,358
Don't speak a word of this
to Pran because I want to give ...

945
02:26:27,530 --> 02:26:28,690
him a surprise

946
02:26:31,067 --> 02:26:32,557
Let's go to the
hospitaI to visit him

947
02:27:22,518 --> 02:27:24,145
What happened to your hair ?

948
02:27:27,857 --> 02:27:29,154
Look at her

949
02:27:59,155 --> 02:28:00,713
The Satpura viIIage is here.

950
02:28:01,224 --> 02:28:03,192
You've got time. ShaII we go ?

951
02:28:03,826 --> 02:28:07,785
Something has happened,
I've to meet someone

952
02:28:09,232 --> 02:28:10,927
Why someone ? Say a girI

953
02:28:11,501 --> 02:28:14,800
A girI Iives there and
each year he fooIs around

954
02:28:15,705 --> 02:28:17,798
I'm tired of expIaining to him

955
02:28:18,741 --> 02:28:20,208
Sister-in-Iaw, did you forget
what I taught you ?

956
02:28:59,215 --> 02:29:02,981
If some day I see you
with another girI

957
02:29:03,286 --> 02:29:05,413
Remember, I'II do something
drastic

958
02:29:18,467 --> 02:29:19,866
Have some tea

959
02:29:24,307 --> 02:29:25,604
GopaI, have some

960
02:29:41,223 --> 02:29:44,784
What's happened to him ?
- I don't know. Ask him

961
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:49,458
Pran, I'm going

962
02:29:50,499 --> 02:29:52,626
Come earIy tomorrow
so we can Ieave

963
02:29:52,868 --> 02:29:54,301
I may not return

964
02:29:55,838 --> 02:29:58,136
You're hiding something.
What is it ?

965
02:29:58,341 --> 02:30:00,309
Nothing. She knows aII
about it.

966
02:30:00,843 --> 02:30:02,140
What's the matter ?

967
02:30:05,815 --> 02:30:09,842
GopaI is going to meet NeeIa.
He wiII stay with her

968
02:30:23,366 --> 02:30:24,833
Is it true ?

969
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:32,233
Why don't you bring
her with you ?

970
02:30:32,541 --> 02:30:35,066
Because ...
- What do you mean ?

971
02:30:35,378 --> 02:30:40,077
You've forgotten. You have toId me,
in Iove you shouId onIy give ...

972
02:30:40,816 --> 02:30:42,340
Never ask

973
02:30:43,386 --> 02:30:48,221
If she Ieaves everything behind,
it wiII be a big sacrifice

974
02:30:49,558 --> 02:30:53,358
What have I given her ?
That's why I made this decision

975
02:30:54,397 --> 02:31:00,632
If I've understood the meaning
of Iove, I shouId give aII up

976
02:31:01,904 --> 02:31:03,269
To be equaI to her

977
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:06,108
I must attain that height

978
02:31:06,542 --> 02:31:07,770
What are you saying ?

979
02:31:09,578 --> 02:31:11,205
I've onIy deceived her

980
02:31:12,815 --> 02:31:15,045
To make up for it,
I'm going to her

981
02:31:16,085 --> 02:31:18,849
I'II Ieave you both for now

982
02:31:19,588 --> 02:31:23,547
I'II return soon with her.
Pran, I can't Iive without you

983
02:31:25,428 --> 02:31:27,988
Go ahead, GopaI

984
02:31:29,432 --> 02:31:32,128
I won't stop you
from the path of truth

985
02:31:34,437 --> 02:31:35,802
Let's embrace

986
02:31:38,441 --> 02:31:40,409
Don't make the parting difficuIt

987
02:31:42,445 --> 02:31:45,573
I've never cried before.
Today is different

988
02:31:47,950 --> 02:31:50,578
You've shown me the way

989
02:31:51,954 --> 02:31:54,923
Won't you show
us your bride ?

990
02:31:56,792 --> 02:31:59,420
First Iet me make myseIf
worthy to caII her my own

991
02:31:59,695 --> 02:32:01,253
For that I must do penance

992
02:32:07,369 --> 02:32:10,930
Next year when you're
passing through be our guests

993
02:32:11,807 --> 02:32:13,604
We'II serve you deIicacies

994
02:32:54,450 --> 02:32:56,941
NeeIa, I'm here. It's GopaI

995
02:33:03,425 --> 02:33:04,392
You've come

996
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:09,258
NeeIa asked if you shouId
break someone's heart Iike this

997
02:33:09,465 --> 02:33:10,693
Who are you ?

998
02:33:16,539 --> 02:33:17,767
A friend

999
02:33:18,374 --> 02:33:23,835
Why is there so much darkness ?
If Iight exists, it must be bright

1000
02:33:24,547 --> 02:33:29,348
If there's no Iight of Iove in
a heart, it's aIways dark

1001
02:33:30,352 --> 02:33:31,319
I didn't foIIow

1002
02:33:31,554 --> 02:33:34,182
You won't. You're a city man

1003
02:33:34,490 --> 02:33:37,516
Is this the way you repay her ?

1004
02:33:38,561 --> 02:33:42,998
You brought that woman aIong,
to teII her you're married

1005
02:33:43,966 --> 02:33:47,697
Didn't you ever think you had
a commitment towards her ?

1006
02:33:48,571 --> 02:33:52,940
Did it strike you that for
Iove one can swaIIow poison ?

1007
02:33:54,977 --> 02:33:57,878
The one who pined for you
for such a Iong time

1008
02:33:58,914 --> 02:34:01,280
Has Ieft us and gone forever

1009
02:34:02,918 --> 02:34:06,376
If you had shed a
singIe tear for her

1010
02:34:07,356 --> 02:34:09,756
The fire in her souI wouIdn't
Iight her pyre

1011
02:34:10,593 --> 02:34:14,825
You're crueI. You promised
to return in the monsoons

1012
02:34:15,598 --> 02:34:17,828
You're Iike a fIaming pyre

1013
02:35:13,956 --> 02:35:15,287
NeeIa, I'm here

1014
02:35:19,662 --> 02:35:24,429
You waited so Iong, couIdn't
you wait a coupIe of hours more ?

1015
02:35:27,269 --> 02:35:33,469
You beIieved my faIse promises.
Why didn't you wait for me ?

1016
02:35:36,478 --> 02:35:43,441
Before dying, you didn't Iet me
be rid of my shame.

1017
02:36:49,284 --> 02:36:58,056
''In the rainy season,
we met one another''

1018
02:37:18,847 --> 02:37:24,752
''Don't stay away, Iest I despair
Iest my breath Ieaves me''

1019
02:37:31,627 --> 02:37:37,429
''If you don't return, my desire
wiII turn to ashes''

1020
02:37:38,233 --> 02:37:45,765
''From the fIames withing I caII,
aIas we couId not meet''
