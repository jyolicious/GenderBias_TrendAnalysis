0
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,722
"These smiling flowers"

1
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,557
"These fragrant gardens"

2
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,389
"This world filled..."

3
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:58,995
"with glorious colours"

4
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,193
"The nectar intoxicates the bees"

5
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:36,535
"The nectar intoxicates the bees"

6
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:52,055
"What little have I to add
to this splendour..."

7
00:03:54,027 --> 00:04:01,832
"save a fear tears,
a few sighs"

8
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:06,836
I told you to keep the place tidy.

9
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:12,838
If that manuscript was here,
then where has it got to?

10
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,010
- What do you know, then?
- He wished you good morning.

11
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:22,016
Fool!
I mean about the manuscript!

12
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:25,024
You've looked at my things?

13
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,360
Wings?

14
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,857
This is a newspaper office,
not a bird house!

15
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,533
Wings, indeed!

16
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:39,535
Things.
Have you read the poems I left?

17
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:41,199
I have.

18
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:44,543
Did you like them?
You'll publish them?

19
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:47,372
I haven't lost my mind.

20
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,880
Call that gibberish poetry? It's
a crusade against unemployment.

21
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:59,157
Poetry deals with delicacies:
You must write poems about love.

22
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,660
You are incomparable, Sir!

23
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:04,493
Write about intoxication...

24
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:10,333
...the beauty of a cup,
or a fine woman.

25
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:13,664
Shut up.
You don't write poetry.

26
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,838
Have you read poets
like Mir and Momin?

27
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,669
Yes, and Josh and Faiz, who are
beyond your comprehension.

28
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:25,514
Give me my poems.
- We will find them later.

29
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:36,856
What do you think
you're doing young man?

30
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:47,866
What right have you
to throw away my poems?

31
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:50,872
Should I make a paper hat of them?

32
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:54,808
Don't insult them by
wearing them on a hollow head.

33
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,982
My head? Hollow?

34
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:02,314
How about yours? If you're
a poet, I'm a donkey!

35
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,817
It's clear, and it's nice
to hear you admit it.

36
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,338
Are you weighing
vegetables or gold?

37
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,348
There's Uncle Vijay!

38
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:55,306
I've caught him.

39
00:07:05,184 --> 00:07:10,144
I'm not your enemy.
Why run from your mother?

40
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:17,326
Where have you been?
I can't bear to see your suffer.

41
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:19,494
I'm well, mother.

42
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,329
Sure you are. Just look
at the state you're in.

43
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:32,834
Come home. I've hidden away
some good food for you.

44
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,008
You've found him?
- Yes.

45
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,302
Well, mother.
So your poet is home!

46
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:02,641
Every literate fool thinks
he's poet.

47
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:08,137
Where else can he get food
as a parasite?

48
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:10,815
Take no notice of them. Eat.

49
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:21,994
See? We earn and mother feeds
delicacies to her layabout.

50
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,829
He's shameless.

51
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:30,662
If he had any self-respect, he'd
starve rather than eat here.

52
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:40,001
Shut up, you two! I won't hear
a word said against him.

53
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:45,677
He's back after so long, and
you can't bear to see him eat.

54
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:50,515
He's hale and hearty. Why doesn't
he earn and not burden us?

55
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:55,517
After his father died,
you should look after him.

56
00:08:56,062 --> 00:09:02,365
It wasn't our wish that our
parents produce such a layabout.

57
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:09,537
That I must have to hear this!

58
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:13,875
It was my misfortunate
to give birth to you two.

59
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:17,871
You won't even let me work,
because of your "prestige".

60
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,550
If I could work as a maid,
I could feed my son.

61
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,054
Sister-in-law,
Where are my poems?

62
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:33,394
Address me, not the women.

63
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,063
I sold them for
10 annas as waste paper.

64
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,572
Waste paper?
You sold my poems for ten annas?

65
00:09:53,285 --> 00:09:55,344
Uncouth fools no better.

66
00:09:55,721 --> 00:10:03,184
You call me uncouth?
Did you hear that, brother?

67
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:10,529
I got rid of them this morning.
Now I'll get rid of you! Out!

68
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:20,705
Where will you go on an empty
stomach? Who will tend to you?

69
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,708
You take me along with you.

70
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,545
I don't want to stay here
for another minute.

71
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,383
Don't worry, mother.
I'll do my best.

72
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:38,393
I'll take you away from here
as soon as I can.

73
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,672
Let me get on with my work
instead of searching waste paper.

74
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:59,184
But there was an important file.

75
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,850
A file?
Containing handwritten papers?

76
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:06,517
Where are they?
- A woman bought them.

77
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:14,030
They caught her eye, she read
some, then she took them away.

78
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,535
Which woman?
Where does she live?

79
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:19,705
I don't know;
she wasn't a local person.

80
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,042
If she comes again, I'll ask.

81
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:44,389
Come come!

82
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,065
Have you fallen out with your
brothers again?

83
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:53,071
Are you hungry?
You'll starve to death.

84
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:57,168
Well, today I got 20 rupees
from a rich man.

85
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:03,170
His car was run over a woman's leg.
I gave false witness for him.

86
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:09,510
Shyam, remember how you found
a lame sparrow as a kid?

87
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:14,525
You cared for it
until it was better.

88
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:16,962
I was only a kid.

89
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,700
But you are a kid now also.

90
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:33,870
"Lament not..."

91
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:41,707
"if I turn my face away..."

92
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:48,715
"your gaze is filled..."

93
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:52,881
"with such longing"

94
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,330
Listen.

95
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,000
I was saying...

96
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:10,334
"Who know what you said?"

97
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:14,505
"Who knows what I heard?"

98
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:18,183
"Something stirred in my heart"

99
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:22,348
"Who knows what you said?"

100
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:05,160
"I felt my heart awaken,
I felt such elation"

101
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:20,501
"Slumbering dreams reawakened,
something stirred in my heart"

102
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,846
"Who knows what you said?"

103
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:28,516
"Who knows what I heard"

104
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,850
"Something stirred in my heart"

105
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:04,486
"I stumble no more,
my feet no longer falter"

106
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:19,664
"There is new life in my step.
Something stirred in my heart"

107
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:23,834
"Who knows what you said"

108
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,846
"Who knows what I heard"

109
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:31,512
"But something sure
stirred in my heart"

110
00:17:04,516 --> 00:17:10,978
"The cascade of my hair
is filled with sweet fragrance"

111
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:21,992
"Doors open to reveal secret longings;

112
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:25,837
"something stirred in my heart"

113
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,835
"Who knows what you said"

114
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:33,507
"Who knows what I heard"

115
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:37,007
"Something stirred in my heart"

116
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,310
Excuse me...
- Yes?

117
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:10,482
That song you were singing...
- You like it?

118
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,151
Where did you get it?

119
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:16,153
It's mine.

120
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:20,651
It isn't yours.
- Then why ask, if you know?

121
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:24,989
Because I...
- What do you want?

122
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:29,664
The file with that song in it.

123
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:31,836
Is that all?

124
00:18:32,704 --> 00:18:34,672
I don't like prattle.

125
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,010
Do you like me?

126
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:42,013
No.

127
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:45,176
Then why follow me?

128
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,852
I want to know only that the
file is with you or not.

129
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,521
It's valuable to me.
Whenever I have money...

130
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:56,858
So you've followed
me empty-handed? Get out!

131
00:18:57,396 --> 00:19:00,024
Please understand.
I want only that file.

132
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:01,696
For me it is important.

133
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,701
You go, or should I
remove my sandal.

134
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:17,875
Stop shouting, silly.
Your customer will run away.

135
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:22,042
A pauper! I lured him here,
but he hasn't a penny.

136
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:47,745
Juhi, it was him.

137
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:52,405
Gulabo, where are you running?

138
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:56,679
I must apologize to him,
I treated him very badly.

139
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:13,201
Stop talking in riddles
and tell me in plain words.

140
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,370
What's all this about?

141
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:21,375
The man who followed me
is a poet.

142
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:26,548
The poet whose poems I bought
as waste paper.

143
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,547
Look: The same paper,
the same writing.

144
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:34,054
And I threw him out as a pauper.

145
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:42,897
He is a pauper.
You did quite the right thing.

146
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:48,562
Foolish girl! Come on

147
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:09,187
Have you written any poems
in the holidays?

148
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,351
A few.

149
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:17,358
Anyone can write poems. If you're
a true poet, create something.

150
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,697
Extempore?

151
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,605
But on what subject?

152
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:33,043
Who is she?

153
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:38,046
There's your subject:
A poem about her.

154
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:46,046
"When I walk,
even my shadow lags behind"

155
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:53,997
"When you walk,
the universe keeps pace"

156
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:59,334
"When I stop,
clouds of misery gather"

157
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:04,501
"When you stop...
spring's radiance is outshone"

158
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,044
Miss Pushlata.

159
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:31,511
"Our love will survive every trial"

160
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:41,527
"We shall never forget
our oath of love"

161
00:25:56,514 --> 00:26:02,646
"We leave the world
far behind"

162
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:08,657
"How long will we
journey together?"

163
00:26:59,678 --> 00:27:00,645
Coolie!

164
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:12,812
A coolie.
- At your service.

165
00:27:18,196 --> 00:27:19,322
Put these in the car.

166
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:27,171
What has the world come to?

167
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:29,499
The educated work as coolies.

168
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,678
Have your money.

169
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:04,308
No credit.

170
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,489
It's counterfeit.

171
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,497
So you've got nothing else.

172
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:35,840
So that's your game!

173
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,839
Now who'll pay for that food
you've touched?

174
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:41,840
Pay up, or I'll have your shirt.

175
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,007
Take the plate away.

176
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:46,684
Put it back!

177
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:51,355
Keep the change.

178
00:28:52,056 --> 00:28:56,516
Go to a barber and get yourself
made to look more human.

179
00:29:04,903 --> 00:29:06,370
Do eat.

180
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:14,037
I'm not hungry.
- Yes, you are.

181
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:16,714
You've no right to take pity on me.

182
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,383
I'm sorry...

183
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,561
...take no notice of me.

184
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:34,398
You have every right
to be angry.

185
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:39,062
I treated you very badly
the other day.

186
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:42,572
I've nothing against you.

187
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:46,243
Then please eat...

188
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,746
...for my sake.

189
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:54,509
What did you say?
For your sake?

190
00:29:56,054 --> 00:29:59,353
You don't even know me.

191
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:03,019
I know you very well.
- How?

192
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:06,030
Through your poems.

193
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:09,859
I know your thoughts
and feelings.

194
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:12,536
What else is there?

195
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:16,707
I don't understand.

196
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,376
But, Miss...

197
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,548
Why address me so politely?

198
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,385
I am not used to it.

199
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:35,882
Until today, people
have spoken rudely to me.

200
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:40,886
I have suffered
their vulgar remarks...

201
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:45,725
...their abuse, their crude jokes.

202
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:50,897
But you behave so respectfully.

203
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:50,561
Massage, oil massage,
make things gleam!

204
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:55,505
"If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom..."

205
00:31:56,207 --> 00:32:02,669
"Don't fret, leave it to me;
I'll set things right soon"

206
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,675
"Massage, oil massage!"

207
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:36,039
"The lotion I use has magic.
Curing baldness and dandruff"

208
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:40,881
"Once my hands begin to whirl,
your hair won't look so rough"

209
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:56,666
"Mark my words, my friend,
this lotion brings you joy"

210
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,843
"It cures a thousand ailments,
so why not give it a try?"

211
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:44,541
"Suffering a lovers' tiff?
Is your business in the throes?"

212
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:49,709
"A touch of this supple hand
will dissipate all woes"

213
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:07,835
"Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings you joy"

214
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:53,046
"Be you a master, be you a slave.
Be you a leader, or one of the led"

215
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:58,314
"Come to me, as everyone does.
Come to me and bow your head"

216
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:13,333
"Mark my words, my friend.
This lotion brings you joy"

217
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:23,339
"It cures a thousand ailments.
So why not give it a try?"

218
00:35:23,714 --> 00:35:27,844
"Don't fret, leave it to me..."

219
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:33,012
"If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom..."

220
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:38,525
"Don't fret, leave it to me;
I'll set things right soon"

221
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:43,859
Mr. Vijay, come here!

222
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:48,534
A great poet: I was singing
one of his songs.

223
00:35:49,073 --> 00:35:54,136
Since I've been singing your
song, business has doubled.

224
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:56,813
Don't go

225
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:59,309
I'll just finish him.
- What?

226
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:00,981
Stay put.

227
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:05,815
Mr. Vijay, I'll give you a
special massage completely free.

228
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:13,160
No, thank you. The present
times have battered me enough.

229
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:17,831
It's amazing how you still
manage to smile.

230
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:21,831
Only a donkey in the noon sun...

231
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:23,998
...and a poet lost in poetry
are so stunned.

232
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:27,833
True, only the glitter of gold
is like the sun.

233
00:36:28,379 --> 00:36:30,176
So donkeys will.

234
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:34,340
What are you talking about?
- We're discussing donkeys.

235
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:09,653
Here I am.

236
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:16,319
Juhi, weren't you
waiting for me?

237
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:21,821
I'm waiting for a man in a car.
- In a car? Not a masseur?

238
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,004
May He puncture his tyres.

239
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,339
May He puncture your head.

240
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:37,014
Juhi, what happened?
- Are you cross with me?

241
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:43,013
Have you no consideration for
the heart you've punctured?

242
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,350
Get it patched up.
- I have no wife to patch it.

243
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:50,527
What can I do about it?
- Marry me.

244
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,196
Stop it, idiot!

245
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:56,967
Did you hear? I have
the gift of massaging.

246
00:37:57,168 --> 00:38:00,467
If I had the gift of cheating
we could afford a car.

247
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,473
I'm done for!

248
00:38:05,509 --> 00:38:08,808
A coconut? I get it.
I won't say another word.

249
00:38:19,357 --> 00:38:23,817
Stop him, or I'll have to
chase him for a mile!

250
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:27,657
Stop! Naughty fellow

251
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,167
Hello, Pushpa.

252
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:34,671
Vijay! I didn't recognize you.

253
00:38:35,373 --> 00:38:39,673
You were so handsome. Whose
"love" brought you to this?

254
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:44,337
Someone who won't let me go...
Unemployment.

255
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:48,685
Your children?
- And their father's.

256
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:53,683
They're Gullu and Fullu,
bright sparks like him.

257
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,859
What do you mean?

258
00:38:56,394 --> 00:39:04,028
There's a gathering at our old
college tonight; you must come.

259
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:11,201
Now I'll have to chase him
for a mile. I'll leave

260
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:17,714
You must come tonight.

261
00:39:47,278 --> 00:39:51,578
Where is Bhattacharya?
He was going to sing next.

262
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:03,352
Vijay, why hide out here?
Come inside.

263
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:06,355
No, Pushpa. My clothes...

264
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:12,196
You're decently covered
from head to foot. Come along.

265
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,548
Ladies and gentleman.

266
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:27,546
Bhattacharya isn't here.
We're delighted...

267
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,883
...we're delighted
that Vijay is here...

268
00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:35,718
...and request him
to recite a poem.

269
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:40,060
Don't be formal. Come along.

270
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:00,676
Let's hear you, Vijay.

271
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:18,525
"I am weary of this
troubled life"

272
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:28,709
"Weary of this troubled existence"

273
00:41:30,414 --> 00:41:36,216
"In my grief, may I not
reject the entire world"

274
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,221
Why such a sad song on this
occasion? Recite a happy verse.

275
00:41:42,593 --> 00:41:45,221
"How can I sing of joy..."

276
00:41:45,596 --> 00:41:49,396
"if I live in pain"

277
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:59,342
"I can only..."

278
00:41:59,543 --> 00:42:04,503
"...return to life what
life itself offers me"

279
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:18,194
"Once again..."

280
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:22,857
"...the memories of love
stir in my heart"

281
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,707
"I confess..."

282
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:36,541
"that I am overcome
by life's blows"

283
00:42:48,626 --> 00:42:51,891
"Today I break all belief..."

284
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:05,331
"...in the illusion of hope"

285
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:12,174
"Today I vow..."

286
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:17,517
"to voice no complaint
against anyone"

287
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:48,044
Are you an ex-student?

288
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:55,324
Have you a job?

289
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:58,995
No, I need one.

290
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:02,832
You recite very well.

291
00:44:07,538 --> 00:44:10,507
Here's my card.
Come to my office tomorrow.

292
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:19,015
- Yourself?
Here are my poems.

293
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:45,864
When did you study at college?
- From '48 to '52.

294
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,038
Shall I read the poems aloud?

295
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:58,146
I married in 1952.

296
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:01,991
Did you study science or arts?

297
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:07,326
Arts. May I recite the poems?

298
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,829
You're sure you left college
in '52, or was it before?

299
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:21,334
In '52. Mr. Ghosh, my poems?
- Will you work?

300
00:45:23,547 --> 00:45:29,679
Service? I thought you called me
about publishing my poems.

301
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:33,686
There's still plenty of time
to publish your poems.

302
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:37,193
I must get to know
you better first.

303
00:45:42,399 --> 00:45:45,027
Mr. Chatterji, this is
your new assistant.

304
00:45:46,904 --> 00:45:48,872
You can start tomorrow.

305
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:27,319
"If I were to give
my heart to you, only you"

306
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:34,167
"If I were to lock
your heart away"

307
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:16,040
"If I were to adorn your hair
with flowers of love"

308
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:22,708
"If I were to shake the flowers
to the ground"

309
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:04,686
"If I were to remember you
in my dreams"

310
00:50:05,395 --> 00:50:11,356
"If I were to give you
sleepless nights"

311
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:53,398
"If I were to lay my heart
at your feet"

312
00:50:53,877 --> 00:51:00,009
"If I were to deny your love
and walk away"

313
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:57,166
How have you been?
- I'm alive.

314
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,669
I want to see you happy.

315
00:53:03,873 --> 00:53:09,834
Don't worry. I have
learnt to be happy.

316
00:53:11,047 --> 00:53:13,015
Has some girl taught you?

317
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:18,350
One girl was enough for me.

318
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:22,191
I don't want to suffer again.

319
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:26,688
You mean you have erased
your first love.

320
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:28,694
I should have.

321
00:53:34,237 --> 00:53:39,038
I forgot: I was really going up.

322
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:18,174
Closing time. Three hours
you've waited. For whom?

323
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:38,359
Does Mr. Vijay come here often?

324
00:54:38,568 --> 00:54:42,368
Yes, but not lately.
Any message for him?

325
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:56,977
So you find something to say
to the waiter. How about me?

326
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:05,661
Have you had time
to look at them?

327
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:10,663
- Which papers?
- Vijay calls them his poetry.

328
00:55:11,034 --> 00:55:14,333
I've read them, they're fine.

329
00:55:16,206 --> 00:55:18,174
Why not publish some?

330
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:21,343
Are you mad?

331
00:55:22,045 --> 00:55:27,506
You must know we publish famous
poets, not the trash of novices.

332
00:55:28,218 --> 00:55:30,345
Put in an advertisement instead.

333
00:55:40,063 --> 00:55:42,031
What do you want?

334
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,869
Sir, this trash of a novice...

335
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:49,872
...may I take it away?

336
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:06,811
Are you free tomorrow evening?
- 

337
00:56:08,024 --> 00:56:11,152
Come and lend a hand
at a party in my house.

338
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:14,830
I'll be there.

339
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:30,005
It's no good getting upset, Juhi.

340
00:56:30,213 --> 00:56:34,172
Who will care for you
in your old age?

341
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:35,684
God willing.

342
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:40,347
Be careful, or a nut
will fall on you.

343
00:56:40,723 --> 00:56:43,851
If you want security,
listen to me.

344
00:56:45,562 --> 00:56:47,689
If I listen to you, I'll starve.

345
00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:52,857
You can hardly keep yourself,
how can you feed me, too?

346
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:59,805
My hunger will be satisfied
by seeing you in my house.

347
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:03,979
Really?

348
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:07,642
Abdul Sattar, do you
love me that much?

349
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:12,817
Let's marry.
- Stop, it idiot!

350
00:57:14,691 --> 00:57:16,989
Do you hear? No, nothing.

351
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,656
No nut.

352
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:29,338
Your husband?
- He's ill.

353
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:32,838
He wanted me to take him to
hospital, but I put it off.

354
00:57:33,209 --> 00:57:35,507
How could I miss such a party?

355
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:38,506
You're very kind!

356
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:47,356
And the children?

357
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:56,131
How did you get my address?

358
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,792
Your address? Do you live here?

359
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:02,967
Let's go outside.

360
00:58:03,172 --> 00:58:06,471
Mr. Ghosh told me to come.

361
00:58:07,844 --> 00:58:11,302
Told you? Do you know him?

362
00:58:12,348 --> 00:58:14,316
I work for him.

363
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:18,817
And you?
- I am his...

364
00:58:19,188 --> 00:58:21,986
Who is the most
talented poet here?

365
00:58:22,525 --> 00:58:24,322
They are all good.

366
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:27,325
But the one
in the black jacket is...

367
00:58:34,037 --> 00:58:37,996
Don't tell him about us.
Understand?

368
00:58:45,381 --> 00:58:49,340
Poems that serve the nation
are better than...

369
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:51,350
...love poems.

370
00:58:52,055 --> 00:58:54,523
Gentleman, drop this argument.

371
00:58:55,725 --> 00:58:57,852
The drinks are here.

372
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:03,195
Leave it to the servant, dear.

373
00:59:05,401 --> 00:59:08,700
Come along, serve the drinks.

374
00:59:20,483 --> 00:59:23,884
"How could I..."

375
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,719
"apprise her of my love?"

376
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:31,552
"The words froze on my lips"

377
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:35,064
"Tears welled in my eyes"

378
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:40,067
"In the gallantry
of frigid hearts"

379
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:43,902
"Where pleasure is sought"

380
00:59:44,674 --> 00:59:47,575
"Clammy fingers cling
to the cup of whine"

381
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,080
"I quaffed the wine,
a drop was spilled"

382
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:06,688
"An extreme despair
came to my rescue"

383
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:13,029
"Receiving my poet, out of pity,
she deigned to love me"

384
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:25,545
"Who are the fortunate ones..."

385
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:29,718
"who gain the love they seek?"

386
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:37,548
Great, Mr Ghosh!
Even your servants recite poems

387
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,397
I'll arrange for the dinner
Can only the rich be poets?

388
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:48,566
Go ahead, young man

389
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:09,185
"When I asked for flowers,
I was given thorns"

390
01:01:11,828 --> 01:01:16,356
"Who are the fortunate ones..."

391
01:01:16,566 --> 01:01:19,364
"who gain the love they seek?"

392
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:33,712
"When I searched for happiness..."

393
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:37,052
"I was lost in streets
of sadness"

394
01:01:49,432 --> 01:01:56,998
"When I sought songs of joy,
I heard songs of sorrow"

395
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:07,005
"Every torment doubled
the pain my heart"

396
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:17,023
"When I asked for flowers,
I was given thorns"

397
01:02:19,395 --> 01:02:23,855
"Who were the fortunate ones..."

398
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:27,031
"who got the love they sought"

399
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:43,046
"Companions came..."

400
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:54,324
"Companions came, stayed awhile,
then left me all alone"

401
01:02:56,532 --> 01:03:04,496
"Who can spare the time to clasp
the hand of a falling man?"

402
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:14,009
"Even my shadow eludes me
as it fades away"

403
01:03:16,485 --> 01:03:24,187
"When I asked for flowers,
I was given thorns"

404
01:03:26,395 --> 01:03:34,029
"Who are the fortunate ones
who gain the love they seek?"

405
01:03:43,913 --> 01:03:51,547
"If this is called living,
then I'll live my life somehow"

406
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:11,496
"I shall not sigh, I'll seal my lips,
I'll dry my tears"

407
01:04:13,709 --> 01:04:21,343
"Why should I fear grief,
when I have encountered it so often?"

408
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:31,357
"When I asked for flowers,
I was given thorns"

409
01:04:33,396 --> 01:04:41,201
"Who are the fortunate ones
who gain the love they seek?"

410
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,808
Wonderful! Excellent!

411
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:17,339
I have come to see you.

412
01:05:25,381 --> 01:05:28,509
Mr. Ghosh has gone
to the board meeting.

413
01:05:30,386 --> 01:05:32,354
You shouldn't have come.

414
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:40,020
I have been very upset
since the party.

415
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:43,699
Do you bear me ill will?

416
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,530
No, Meena.
I bear no grudge.

417
01:05:55,011 --> 01:05:59,141
Why did you sing that
heart-rending poem that day?

418
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:09,151
You revived my desires.
- Forget the past.

419
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:17,154
I had forgotten,
I had remoulded my life.

420
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,168
I controlled my heart.

421
01:06:23,706 --> 01:06:27,335
Why disturb my heart?
Why return to my life?

422
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:33,341
When did I ever leave
your life? You left me.

423
01:06:34,383 --> 01:06:41,186
Do not try to correct your first
mistake with another, Meena.

424
01:06:41,724 --> 01:06:43,692
I've made no mistake.

425
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:48,856
Besides love, a sensible woman needs
security and the comfort of a home.

426
01:06:49,398 --> 01:06:51,525
And some money is also required.

427
01:06:53,569 --> 01:06:55,127
For those things...

428
01:06:55,337 --> 01:07:00,639
You married Mr. Ghosh,
selling love for wealth.

429
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:02,978
Don't accuse me wrongly.

430
01:07:05,014 --> 01:07:09,314
I loved you, but you
were poor and unemployed.

431
01:07:10,186 --> 01:07:14,646
In life, besides love
and poetry, there's hunger.

432
01:07:15,357 --> 01:07:19,987
How could you bear my burden
when you couldn't feed yourself?

433
01:07:20,696 --> 01:07:22,664
You gave me no chance.

434
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:27,495
When a man has responsibilities,
he shoulders them.

435
01:07:28,037 --> 01:07:30,005
Don't deceive yourself.

436
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:35,841
You sought wealth and
high position in society.

437
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:40,838
Now you have them. Despite that,
you are restless and resentful.

438
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,018
You know why?

439
01:07:44,053 --> 01:07:46,681
Because you have always
been selfish.

440
01:07:48,557 --> 01:07:51,185
You never considered my plight.

441
01:07:52,728 --> 01:07:56,289
Now you don't
consider your husband.

442
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:07,298
Life's real joy lies
in making others happy.

443
01:08:08,344 --> 01:08:12,974
You've never understood that;
that's why you're unhappy.

444
01:08:26,695 --> 01:08:28,162
Wonderful!

445
01:08:28,364 --> 01:08:30,992
My wife's no better
than a streetwalker.

446
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,499
Vijay and I hardly know each other.

447
01:08:34,703 --> 01:08:36,830
How long has this been going on?

448
01:08:36,972 --> 01:08:38,940
We hardly know each other.

449
01:08:39,108 --> 01:08:41,076
Anything else?
- Nothing.

450
01:08:42,378 --> 01:08:47,680
Then let's see how upset you are
when I dismiss him.

451
01:09:02,731 --> 01:09:06,360
Pay up!
- I earn my money the hard way.

452
01:09:06,735 --> 01:09:08,703
Scoundrel! Pay Up!

453
01:09:10,639 --> 01:09:12,197
Constable!

454
01:09:58,053 --> 01:10:00,021
Save me, do something!

455
01:10:02,558 --> 01:10:04,025
You?

456
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,028
What's the matter?

457
01:10:10,065 --> 01:10:12,033
Has a girl run this way?

458
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:14,365
No.

459
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:18,529
Who is she?
- My wife.

460
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,037
Sorry sir, I made a mistake.

461
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,718
What is your name?

462
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:34,552
Gulab.

463
01:10:35,257 --> 01:10:39,057
It's all clear now.
You can go safely.

464
01:11:06,555 --> 01:11:13,688
"Tormented by a long absence..."

465
01:11:16,565 --> 01:11:18,533
"Radha longed..."

466
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:25,695
"for her lover"

467
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:35,881
"One day she went..."

468
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:45,052
"to her beloved and lamented"

469
01:11:52,101 --> 01:11:57,004
"Hold me in your arms
today, my love..."

470
01:11:57,206 --> 01:12:00,175
"so that I am fulfilled"

471
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:16,018
"Ease the pain in my heart..."

472
01:12:16,558 --> 01:12:20,016
"slake the fire in my body"

473
01:12:50,592 --> 01:12:52,719
"My eyes are wide open"

474
01:12:54,696 --> 01:12:57,324
"My luckless eyes"

475
01:13:03,705 --> 01:13:07,505
"I can't rest until
I am truly yours"

476
01:13:13,115 --> 01:13:17,017
"I can hardly see ahead.
Behind me torment follows"

477
01:13:17,386 --> 01:13:21,345
"Without you,
life is meaningless"

478
01:13:22,391 --> 01:13:28,352
"Beloved, make my love complete"

479
01:13:37,406 --> 01:13:44,869
"so it may last
"Call me your very own"

480
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:18,005
"Call me your own,
"Slake the thirst..."

481
01:14:42,471 --> 01:14:48,034
"Slake the thirst that
lies deep in my soul"

482
01:14:49,077 --> 01:14:54,982
"Beloved, make my love complete..."

483
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:11,162
"so it may last
beyond eternity"

484
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:38,843
There is a millionaire
in the car. Come with me.

485
01:17:40,215 --> 01:17:42,342
No! Go away!

486
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:47,518
You won't?
I've already promised him!

487
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:50,858
Let me go!

488
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:55,630
You won't obey me?

489
01:18:09,678 --> 01:18:11,646
Get going!

490
01:18:12,347 --> 01:18:17,148
And thank your lucky stars
I used my weak hand.

491
01:18:17,686 --> 01:18:19,654
Be seated.

492
01:18:20,188 --> 01:18:24,989
This is my territory and
if anyone disturbs you...

493
01:18:25,127 --> 01:18:27,823
...just call for me,
I'll come running.

494
01:18:30,031 --> 01:18:31,999
Where are you?

495
01:18:33,034 --> 01:18:36,492
What did you say?
- I didn't say a word.

496
01:18:37,873 --> 01:18:40,842
She's lost, isn't she?

497
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:44,337
Who is he?
- Who?

498
01:18:44,546 --> 01:18:46,673
I wouldn't ask if I knew,
would I?

499
01:18:47,048 --> 01:18:51,348
Just a postman knows the
meaning of postcard, so I...

500
01:18:51,486 --> 01:18:53,852
a masseur, can tell things
at a glance...

501
01:18:54,222 --> 01:18:58,682
Sitting here looking lost,
not noticing me.

502
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:02,024
Not hearing a word,
that's a sure sign.

503
01:19:02,164 --> 01:19:04,530
I see you've fallen in love.

504
01:19:05,901 --> 01:19:08,028
Rushing off is a sign, too.

505
01:19:10,572 --> 01:19:12,540
Tell me truly who he is.

506
01:19:13,909 --> 01:19:16,878
A poet.
- I have a poet friend.

507
01:19:17,078 --> 01:19:19,046
What's your poet's name?

508
01:19:20,081 --> 01:19:23,209
Vijay.
- So is mine.

509
01:19:23,418 --> 01:19:25,886
I'll ask him if he
knows another Vijay-poet.

510
01:19:26,254 --> 01:19:28,381
Maybe they're the same person.

511
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:36,720
Possibly, I'll ask him
Brothers, is all well?

512
01:20:05,393 --> 01:20:06,690
What are you doing?

513
01:20:06,828 --> 01:20:11,527
What's it you if someone
is dead, you vagabond?

514
01:20:11,733 --> 01:20:13,701
Who is dead?

515
01:20:15,403 --> 01:20:17,530
Whose last rites are these?
- Mother's.

516
01:20:25,413 --> 01:20:27,040
Don't call us brother.

517
01:20:27,249 --> 01:20:29,217
We share our relationship
because of her.

518
01:20:29,584 --> 01:20:32,212
And now that she is dead,
you are dead for us.

519
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:42,060
"Where will you go
on the empty stomach"

520
01:20:43,765 --> 01:20:46,063
"Who will look after you"

521
01:20:47,102 --> 01:20:52,233
"I don't want to stay in this
house for another minute"

522
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:07,511
Let's see you dance.
I'll play the drums for you.

523
01:21:08,056 --> 01:21:10,854
Ask your friend to join us.

524
01:21:11,226 --> 01:21:13,524
Come on, drink it!

525
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,856
I'd drink poison for her
is she told me to.

526
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:21,035
He's shy!

527
01:21:21,736 --> 01:21:25,695
Come, sir,
have a drink for my sake.

528
01:21:27,075 --> 01:21:28,702
Strange chap!

529
01:21:29,077 --> 01:21:32,376
Are you a man or a mouse?
You look as if your grandma died.

530
01:21:50,765 --> 01:21:53,666
He's a beginner,
but he's finished it!

531
01:21:54,369 --> 01:21:59,500
You can't be a real beginner!
When did you start?

532
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:05,002
"I was so overcome
with sorrow"

533
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:11,845
"I drank to drown
the grief"

534
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:19,516
"My poor heart was so dejected"

535
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:25,689
"I drank out of pity for it"

536
01:22:30,405 --> 01:22:32,373
So he's a poet, too?

537
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:37,371
Indeed! He's composed
hundreds of poems.

538
01:22:38,747 --> 01:22:42,877
"For so many years
the world..."

539
01:22:44,085 --> 01:22:47,384
"has rejected and dismissed me"

540
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:54,995
"Today I..."

541
01:22:56,364 --> 01:23:00,494
"...reject the world"

542
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:08,002
"And I think..."

543
01:23:09,878 --> 01:23:14,338
"...to forget that it exists"

544
01:24:50,578 --> 01:24:52,546
Where to?

545
01:24:55,183 --> 01:24:56,980
My child is ill.

546
01:24:57,185 --> 01:25:00,484
I need you, too.
Tend to us first.

547
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:05,315
Tend to us first,
then see to your child.

548
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:13,667
Start the music.

549
01:26:13,861 --> 01:26:19,322
"These lanes, these houses,
where pleasure is auctioned"

550
01:26:27,709 --> 01:26:32,669
"These ravaged caravans of
life that pass us by"

551
01:26:33,214 --> 01:26:38,345
"Where are they,
the guardians of dignity?"

552
01:26:38,886 --> 01:26:43,687
"Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?"

553
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:10,978
"These insidious streets,
where infamy is traded"

554
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:16,650
"Where men conceal their
names, where money talks"

555
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:22,327
"Where chastity is bargained for
and purity is sold"

556
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:27,657
"Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?"

557
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:44,344
"These old streets
where dreams wither..."

558
01:27:45,053 --> 01:27:50,184
"where flowers are
trampled underfoot"

559
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:55,788
"These sham celebrations
of colour are for sale"

560
01:27:56,164 --> 01:28:00,965
"Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?"

561
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:17,974
"These brightly lit rooms
where dancing bells chime"

562
01:28:21,022 --> 01:28:25,982
"The tables beat in time
with heavy hearts"

563
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:45,009
"These soulless rooms
that echo to coughing"

564
01:28:45,713 --> 01:28:50,673
"Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?"

565
01:29:02,397 --> 01:29:07,357
"These garlands, these walls..."

566
01:29:08,069 --> 01:29:13,029
"...stained with blood"

567
01:29:13,408 --> 01:29:18,539
"These fragile bodies,
these vain faces"

568
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:24,211
"Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?"

569
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:41,232
"Old men pass through here,
young man too stop awhile"

570
01:29:41,769 --> 01:29:48,231
"Sons, respected fathers
and husbands"

571
01:29:51,446 --> 01:29:56,850
"These are our wives,
our sisters, our mothers"

572
01:29:57,218 --> 01:30:02,349
"Where are those who claim
to be proud of this land?"

573
01:30:19,407 --> 01:30:24,037
"These daughters
of Eve seek help"

574
01:30:24,579 --> 01:30:29,710
"These daughters
of Radha and Yashoda"

575
01:30:41,429 --> 01:30:46,731
"These daughters of Zulekha,
these children of God"

576
01:30:47,268 --> 01:30:52,570
"Where are the leaders who claim
to be proud of this land?"

577
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:10,012
"Summon all the leaders
of this land"

578
01:31:10,391 --> 01:31:15,693
"Show them the treachery,
show them these devious streets"

579
01:31:16,230 --> 01:31:21,691
"Summon all those who claim
to be proud of this land"

580
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:05,808
Who is it? It's you.

581
01:32:08,182 --> 01:32:10,150
Come with me.

582
01:32:11,852 --> 01:32:14,082
Taking a pity of me again?

583
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:18,758
Today I am not hungry.

584
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:24,090
I have drowned
my hunger in drink.

585
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,768
I have drunk

586
01:32:29,971 --> 01:32:35,773
...all my joys and sorrows.
I have swallowed everything.

587
01:32:37,311 --> 01:32:40,280
Where to?

588
01:32:40,982 --> 01:32:45,112
Come and rest in my house.

589
01:32:46,988 --> 01:32:48,956
Leave when you feel better.

590
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:52,618
Should I leave
when I feel better?

591
01:32:53,494 --> 01:32:57,453
I'll feel better when
I've left this world, Gulabo.

592
01:32:59,333 --> 01:33:01,301
Everything is lost.

593
01:33:01,836 --> 01:33:08,469
My job. And my mother
has left me forever.

594
01:33:10,678 --> 01:33:15,411
What am I doing here?
Why am I alive, Gulabo?

595
01:33:15,883 --> 01:33:17,851
Don't talk like that.

596
01:33:18,452 --> 01:33:21,580
The world needs you
and your poetry.

597
01:33:21,722 --> 01:33:23,747
The world needs nobody.

598
01:33:24,959 --> 01:33:29,419
I tried my best to make
my poetry reach the world.

599
01:33:30,297 --> 01:33:33,425
But you know how
the world valued it?

600
01:33:34,135 --> 01:33:38,094
Waste paper sold for ten annas.

601
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:42,769
My life is valued at
ten annas, Gulabo.

602
01:33:43,144 --> 01:33:46,944
Do you want me to live
for ten annas?

603
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:52,449
Don't lose courage,
there's much to live for.

604
01:33:53,654 --> 01:33:55,622
There's Meena.

605
01:34:01,996 --> 01:34:03,964
How do you know her?

606
01:34:04,665 --> 01:34:08,624
I read her name on your file.
Who is she?

607
01:34:13,107 --> 01:34:17,237
She is chaste and
virtuous society girl...

608
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:21,570
...who loves for fun
and amusement...

609
01:34:22,116 --> 01:34:25,916
...and sells that love
for comfort.

610
01:34:28,122 --> 01:34:31,580
But why take
such an interest in her?

611
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,764
Because you did.

612
01:34:39,133 --> 01:34:41,101
That's why.

613
01:34:49,310 --> 01:34:51,278
You mean you...

614
01:34:52,146 --> 01:34:54,444
No, forget me.

615
01:34:56,317 --> 01:34:59,775
I can only make you suffer.

616
01:35:01,155 --> 01:35:05,455
I've never been able
to make anyone happy.

617
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:07,950
You'll publish them?
- What for?

618
01:36:08,155 --> 01:36:11,454
Am I mad?
Call that gibberish poetry?

619
01:36:11,826 --> 01:36:13,726
The world needs you...

620
01:36:14,094 --> 01:36:18,724
You must know we publish famous
poets, not the trash of novices.

621
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:20,834
Could you bear my burden...

622
01:36:20,935 --> 01:36:22,562
...when you couldn't
feed yourself?

623
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:25,398
It wasn't our wish that...

624
01:36:25,539 --> 01:36:28,565
...our parents produce
such a good-for-nothing.

625
01:40:11,298 --> 01:40:13,198
Have you read about the poet?

626
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:16,359
I knew him well.
Why did he commit suicide?

627
01:40:18,305 --> 01:40:20,273
"Tragic death of young poet"

628
01:40:27,081 --> 01:40:31,211
"Last night a young man jumped
in front of the Burdwan train"

629
01:40:31,919 --> 01:40:36,549
"His body was mutilated
beyond recognition"

630
01:40:37,257 --> 01:40:40,226
"A letter in his pocket..."

631
01:40:41,095 --> 01:40:46,055
"...contained his last poem,
his last message to world"

632
01:40:48,102 --> 01:40:50,570
"His name was... Vijay"

633
01:40:58,779 --> 01:41:00,406
Are you all right?

634
01:41:46,827 --> 01:41:48,795
What is it?

635
01:42:30,804 --> 01:42:32,772
SHADOWS

636
01:42:38,812 --> 01:42:40,780
Send her in.

637
01:42:56,663 --> 01:42:58,631
Who are you?

638
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:08,801
Where from?
- Sona... from Dharmtallah.

639
01:43:12,179 --> 01:43:13,908
Give me the poems.

640
01:43:14,114 --> 01:43:18,414
If you know they are poems,
you'll know they are beautiful.

641
01:43:19,453 --> 01:43:21,421
I want them published.

642
01:43:29,963 --> 01:43:33,091
So you're going to show them
to my husband.

643
01:43:35,636 --> 01:43:38,104
What's your price?
- You'll publish them?

644
01:43:38,305 --> 01:43:41,604
May I will, may be not.
Name your price!

645
01:43:42,976 --> 01:43:44,273
Price?

646
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:51,281
I haven't come to bargain.
I want them published.

647
01:43:56,657 --> 01:43:59,626
Are these poems precious
to you?

648
01:44:02,162 --> 01:44:04,130
How did you know Vijay?

649
01:44:05,165 --> 01:44:07,633
By good fortune.
- Your relationship?

650
01:44:10,337 --> 01:44:11,634
Relationship?

651
01:44:11,838 --> 01:44:16,741
How could such a gentleman
meet a lady of your background?

652
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:20,079
Good fortune.

653
01:44:20,614 --> 01:44:22,582
You sell much for money.

654
01:44:23,283 --> 01:44:25,410
Why not sell these poems?

655
01:44:33,293 --> 01:44:35,261
Are you Meena?

656
01:44:36,463 --> 01:44:40,092
My husband will be here
any moment.

657
01:44:40,467 --> 01:44:42,435
Sell me the poems before he comes.

658
01:44:42,803 --> 01:44:47,103
I'll pay 1,000 rupees... 2000.
- Not even 30,000.

659
01:44:52,813 --> 01:44:55,782
What's that? Show me.

660
01:45:05,659 --> 01:45:07,126
"For Meena..."

661
01:45:09,262 --> 01:45:12,129
"...whose memory
has inspired every word"

662
01:45:33,787 --> 01:45:36,415
I brought them
to have them published.

663
01:45:51,138 --> 01:45:54,596
What is that?
- It's all I own in the world.

664
01:45:56,977 --> 01:46:01,937
I can't pay you more
for their publication.

665
01:46:05,986 --> 01:46:07,954
They must be published.

666
01:46:09,656 --> 01:46:14,389
I'll be eternally
grateful to you.

667
01:46:45,459 --> 01:46:49,919
A fine bookseller you are!
We want Vijay's book.

668
01:46:51,131 --> 01:46:54,259
How can it be sold out so soon?

669
01:46:54,801 --> 01:46:56,928
Is it "under the counter"?

670
01:46:57,471 --> 01:47:01,271
Have the third edition tomorrow.
Or we'll burn the shop.

671
01:47:21,595 --> 01:47:24,564
If only you were alive
to see this.

672
01:47:36,943 --> 01:47:39,411
Have you established his identity?

673
01:47:39,779 --> 01:47:43,738
No, he hasn't said one word
since he was admitted.

674
01:47:58,798 --> 01:48:00,766
How are you?

675
01:48:05,138 --> 01:48:08,437
Let me know if he speaks at all.

676
01:48:25,091 --> 01:48:27,889
I can't pay more than
5,000 for them.

677
01:48:28,428 --> 01:48:31,397
They've his poems
but too high a price.

678
01:48:31,765 --> 01:48:37,226
Do you want to cream of all the
profit and leave me with nothing?

679
01:48:37,437 --> 01:48:40,406
Then name a sensible price politely.

680
01:48:40,774 --> 01:48:44,232
Sir, these poems are priceless.

681
01:48:44,444 --> 01:48:48,574
Vijay's last, unique works.

682
01:48:49,616 --> 01:48:51,584
I'll share fifty-fifty.

683
01:48:52,118 --> 01:48:56,077
I can't pay that much.
- Nice to have met you.

684
01:48:57,624 --> 01:49:00,092
You're strange.

685
01:49:00,961 --> 01:49:05,261
Twenty five per cent.
My last offer.

686
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:08,301
Now you may leave.

687
01:49:08,635 --> 01:49:12,867
I wouldn't like you to
think I'm unreasonable.

688
01:49:13,239 --> 01:49:15,207
Here, let's shake on it.

689
01:49:17,243 --> 01:49:18,870
"I recollect the past"

690
01:49:19,245 --> 01:49:25,878
"I adorn your hair with flowers"

691
01:49:27,087 --> 01:49:30,056
"What is this secret
which chokes me..."

692
01:49:30,924 --> 01:49:33,722
"which parches my lips?"

693
01:49:34,761 --> 01:49:38,060
"I recollect the past"

694
01:50:00,954 --> 01:50:02,080
"Shadows"

695
01:50:10,864 --> 01:50:15,699
These are my poems, all mine.
This is my book.

696
01:50:15,902 --> 01:50:18,530
Of course.
But what is your name?

697
01:50:19,072 --> 01:50:24,032
My name is Vijay. This book
was written by me.

698
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:28,210
The Vijay who wrote
this book is dead.

699
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:31,546
Think carefully,
what is your real name?

700
01:50:32,585 --> 01:50:34,553
Why don't you believe me?

701
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:39,552
I tell you my name is Vijay.

702
01:50:54,107 --> 01:50:56,075
Why have you kept me here?

703
01:50:57,777 --> 01:50:59,404
Let me go!

704
01:51:02,115 --> 01:51:05,744
I think he has lost his mind.

705
01:51:08,121 --> 01:51:10,089
Telephone Doctor Sen.

706
01:51:26,488 --> 01:51:28,456
So you are Vijay's brothers?

707
01:51:29,324 --> 01:51:32,782
His elder brothers.
- I'm the eldest.

708
01:51:34,162 --> 01:51:35,959
What do you want?

709
01:51:38,834 --> 01:51:42,292
Shall I tell him?
- No, you go ahead.

710
01:51:43,839 --> 01:51:45,966
I asked you what you want.

711
01:51:46,842 --> 01:51:51,302
Well, I brought up Vijay
and educated him...

712
01:51:51,513 --> 01:51:57,145
...and cared for him so that
he would be someone one day.

713
01:51:58,019 --> 01:52:01,477
So did I.
- I have no time. Get to the point.

714
01:52:02,691 --> 01:52:07,651
The point is, we've come for
some money from you.

715
01:52:13,134 --> 01:52:15,102
Are you sane?

716
01:52:15,303 --> 01:52:18,602
We are the rightful heirs
to his property.

717
01:52:18,807 --> 01:52:20,104
Including poems.

718
01:52:20,308 --> 01:52:25,109
We have a legal right to the
money you gain from his works.

719
01:52:25,247 --> 01:52:29,616
We don't want it all,
we'll be content with some.

720
01:52:30,986 --> 01:52:34,285
I don't know you and I didn't
get the poems from you.

721
01:52:34,823 --> 01:52:37,451
You won't get a penny.
Understand?

722
01:53:26,308 --> 01:53:28,936
It isn't Vijay.

723
01:53:33,148 --> 01:53:34,615
Shyam!

724
01:53:36,985 --> 01:53:39,783
No, he's not Vijay.

725
01:54:03,345 --> 01:54:05,313
So you want a share?

726
01:54:10,018 --> 01:54:12,578
The rightful claimant is Vijay.

727
01:54:13,621 --> 01:54:15,589
He's alive.

728
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:18,759
Yes, he's alive.

729
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,768
No! You must be joking.

730
01:54:27,969 --> 01:54:29,937
I never joke.

731
01:54:30,138 --> 01:54:34,438
However, you will get
a share of the profit.

732
01:54:35,143 --> 01:54:37,111
Two percent...

733
01:54:37,812 --> 01:54:39,780
...on condition that...

734
01:54:40,148 --> 01:54:42,616
...you refuse to identify Vijay.

735
01:54:45,153 --> 01:54:48,281
Why shouldn't we identify
our brother?

736
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:51,288
What are we?
- Do you consider us so low?

737
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:56,125
For a mere two per cent?
- Make it 6%.

738
01:55:01,169 --> 01:55:05,128
Massage! Oil Massage!

739
01:55:22,457 --> 01:55:27,258
A ghost!
Lord, please make it vanish.

740
01:55:37,806 --> 01:55:40,104
Let go off poor Sattar!

741
01:55:40,308 --> 01:55:42,606
It's me, Vijay.

742
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:46,781
So you aren't dead.

743
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,610
He's really alive.

744
01:55:51,152 --> 01:55:55,452
I've been forcibly detained.
Get me out.

745
01:56:03,998 --> 01:56:05,465
What is it?

746
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:10,127
I'll massage your head
only if you agree.

747
01:56:16,377 --> 01:56:20,575
"If your head reels with pain,
or your heart sinks in gloom"

748
01:56:58,319 --> 01:56:59,786
Brother.

749
01:57:16,771 --> 01:57:22,732
Don't you recognize me?
I'm your brother Vijay.

750
01:57:24,612 --> 01:57:26,580
Why so quiet?

751
01:57:28,283 --> 01:57:30,410
Won't you recognize me, either?

752
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:33,917
Are you mad?
Vijay's dead.

753
01:57:35,290 --> 01:57:39,249
You've the nerve
to call yourself our brother.

754
01:57:39,460 --> 01:57:45,763
Get out of here! Our brother!

755
01:58:09,157 --> 01:58:13,719
Going to the meeting for
Vijay's death anniversary?

756
01:58:14,429 --> 01:58:19,059
Of course.
Vijay was a friend of mine.

757
01:58:19,767 --> 01:58:21,894
Did you really know Vijay?

758
01:58:27,775 --> 01:58:30,744
Move aside, let me pass.

759
01:58:33,281 --> 01:58:34,748
He was fine poet.

760
01:58:34,882 --> 01:58:39,410
A noble man.
If it wasn't for my help...

761
01:58:40,221 --> 01:58:42,746
...he would have died
6 months earlier.

762
01:58:42,957 --> 01:58:45,755
How?
- Of starvation.

763
01:58:48,129 --> 01:58:50,097
Hurry, we won't get a seat.

764
01:59:33,608 --> 01:59:36,236
You all know...

765
01:59:37,111 --> 01:59:40,410
...we are gathered
in memory of Vijay.

766
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:45,248
On this day last year...

767
01:59:45,787 --> 01:59:50,087
...a terrible event took
the great poem from us.

768
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:54,587
If I could have saved Vijay,
I would have given my fortune...

769
01:59:55,129 --> 01:59:57,597
...and my life.

770
01:59:59,634 --> 02:00:01,602
It could not be.

771
02:00:03,638 --> 02:00:06,607
Why? Because of you all.

772
02:00:07,475 --> 02:00:10,273
It is said
he committed suicide...

773
02:00:10,645 --> 02:00:12,545
But in fact you killed him.

774
02:00:13,181 --> 02:00:15,877
If Vijay were alive
he would see...

775
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:18,385
the world which...

776
02:00:18,753 --> 02:00:21,881
...starved him is ready
to shower wealth on him.

777
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:24,888
The world in which...

778
02:00:25,259 --> 02:00:28,558
...he died unknown,
would treat him as a king.

779
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:34,891
Today this world
would give him a palace.

780
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:46,073
"This world of palaces, of kingdoms,
this world of power"

781
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:53,243
"The enemies of humanity,
this world of rituals"

782
02:01:12,140 --> 02:01:18,272
"These men who crave wealth,
as their way of life"

783
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:25,283
"For what will it profit a man
if he gain the world?"

784
02:01:43,771 --> 02:01:49,971
"People with parched souls,
with wounded spirits"

785
02:01:50,678 --> 02:01:56,981
"With troubled gaze and sad hearts"

786
02:01:58,019 --> 02:02:03,821
"This world which is distraught,
and full of trouble"

787
02:02:04,792 --> 02:02:10,822
"For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?"

788
02:02:28,983 --> 02:02:34,944
"The world where life
is considered trivial"

789
02:02:35,823 --> 02:02:41,784
"A world where the dead
are worshipped"

790
02:02:42,663 --> 02:02:48,624
"A world where death
is cheaper than life"

791
02:02:49,504 --> 02:02:55,465
"For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?"

792
02:03:13,628 --> 02:03:19,430
"A world where youth
is driven to crime"

793
02:03:20,134 --> 02:03:26,437
"A world where the young are
groomed for the market-place"

794
02:03:27,308 --> 02:03:33,269
"A world where love is another name
for trade"

795
02:03:34,315 --> 02:03:40,276
"For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?"

796
02:03:58,272 --> 02:04:04,472
"A world where man is worth nothing"

797
02:04:05,012 --> 02:04:11,315
"A world where loyalty and friendship
mean nothing"

798
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:31,761
"A world where love is
regarded with disdain"

799
02:04:32,573 --> 02:04:38,773
"For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?"

800
02:04:58,833 --> 02:05:03,793
"Burn this world, blow it asunder"

801
02:05:04,605 --> 02:05:12,137
"Burn this world, blow it asunder"

802
02:05:12,713 --> 02:05:17,741
"Take this world away
from my sight"

803
02:05:18,219 --> 02:05:23,088
"This world belongs to you,
you keep it"

804
02:05:23,958 --> 02:05:28,759
"For what shall it profit a man
if he gain the world?"

805
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:51,441
Stop his brothers,
give whatever they want.

806
02:06:52,146 --> 02:06:54,114
They mustn't identify him.

807
02:06:54,815 --> 02:06:56,783
Sorry, all your resources
cannot stop...

808
02:06:57,651 --> 02:07:00,119
...Vijay being identified now.

809
02:07:01,155 --> 02:07:03,123
Can you bribe everyone now?

810
02:07:03,657 --> 02:07:06,956
Buy everyone,
I'll spend all I have...

811
02:07:07,428 --> 02:07:09,953
I don't want it proved
he's Vijay.

812
02:07:10,598 --> 02:07:13,726
Or we'll lose our name,
we'll be finished.

813
02:07:14,101 --> 02:07:18,231
Save yourself. I know how
to save my own neck.

814
02:07:18,773 --> 02:07:26,236
What!
You think you'll do it so easily?

815
02:07:26,781 --> 02:07:29,579
You denied him, too!

816
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:33,416
I sway with the wind.

817
02:07:33,788 --> 02:07:39,249
I followed you when it was in my
interest. Now I'll ally with Vijay.

818
02:07:55,476 --> 02:07:57,944
You're looking happy.

819
02:07:58,145 --> 02:08:02,104
Why not? I have my hands on
the king of fame.

820
02:08:02,316 --> 02:08:07,618
I've got Vijay; I'll earn
millions by publishing his poems.

821
02:08:09,490 --> 02:08:11,458
Bravo! Excellent!

822
02:08:11,992 --> 02:08:15,223
It's a goldmine.

823
02:08:15,763 --> 02:08:18,231
Do you think
you'll mine it alone?

824
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:22,068
You'll share it with me.

825
02:08:23,103 --> 02:08:26,561
What are you gaping at?
Get out!

826
02:08:32,613 --> 02:08:35,241
You are very insolent, young man.

827
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:38,748
Who are you?
- Never mind.

828
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:43,249
But I can identify Vijay
if I so choose...

829
02:08:43,624 --> 02:08:48,084
...and if I don't, he'll
be shut away as a lunatic.

830
02:08:48,462 --> 02:08:52,421
Are you the head of state,
to lock someone away?

831
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,928
His brothers know him.

832
02:08:56,136 --> 02:08:59,435
We'll identify him.
- Of course.

833
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:03,770
He may not care about us.
- We may not profit.

834
02:09:03,978 --> 02:09:06,776
After all he is our blood.
- Why shouldn't we identify him?

835
02:09:06,981 --> 02:09:10,439
Well said!

836
02:09:10,985 --> 02:09:14,045
Brothers are Brothers!

837
02:09:14,255 --> 02:09:17,053
I spent 5,000 on his education.

838
02:09:17,258 --> 02:09:18,725
4,000 on feeding.

839
02:09:18,926 --> 02:09:22,054
If we'd loaned it,
we'd have 15,000 now.

840
02:09:22,263 --> 02:09:24,731
Will you pay to identify him?

841
02:09:26,433 --> 02:09:30,563
15,000?
- Yes, 15,000.

842
02:09:31,939 --> 02:09:36,740
But you have your precious
brother back.

843
02:09:37,945 --> 02:09:39,913
What more could you want?

844
02:09:40,114 --> 02:09:43,914
We don't want a brother,
we want money.

845
02:09:44,118 --> 02:09:45,915
We can't eat him.

846
02:09:55,129 --> 02:09:57,597
Vijay, my brother!

847
02:10:43,877 --> 02:10:46,072
Is he really Vijay?
Where's the proof?

848
02:10:46,513 --> 02:10:50,074
Sit down! Soon you'll say
that I'm not Sattar.

849
02:10:51,518 --> 02:10:53,918
How can we know that
he is Vijay?

850
02:10:55,622 --> 02:10:58,420
What about the suicide?
We prove it.

851
02:11:02,796 --> 02:11:04,764
The neighbourhood knows,
Vijay is our brother.

852
02:11:05,132 --> 02:11:07,100
We say he is Vijay.

853
02:11:08,635 --> 02:11:12,765
And I confirm that he's my
boyhood friend.

854
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:15,108
The great poet Vijay.

855
02:11:47,341 --> 02:11:54,474
The Vijay you wish
to welcome so warmly...

856
02:11:56,016 --> 02:12:00,817
...the Vijay for whom
you shout slogans...

857
02:12:02,022 --> 02:12:05,321
...I am not that Vijay.

858
02:12:10,264 --> 02:12:14,257
I'm not Vijay.
- Why deceive us?

859
02:12:14,735 --> 02:12:17,761
I said he was an imposter.

860
02:12:18,305 --> 02:12:20,273
A publicity-seeker. Hit him!

861
02:12:47,935 --> 02:12:52,963
"Burn it! Blow it asunder"

862
02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:55,805
"Burn it..."

863
02:12:56,343 --> 02:13:01,474
"blow the world asunder"

864
02:13:01,849 --> 02:13:07,151
"Take this world away
from my sight"

865
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:12,754
"The world belongs to you,
you keep it"

866
02:13:27,975 --> 02:13:31,274
Are you mad?
What did you do?

867
02:13:31,478 --> 02:13:33,776
Tell these people you're Vijay,
there is still time.

868
02:13:42,489 --> 02:13:45,287
What's wrong?
They're all here for you.

869
02:13:45,826 --> 02:13:47,453
Why not tell them?

870
02:13:49,997 --> 02:13:51,965
I am not that Vijay.

871
02:13:53,167 --> 02:13:57,297
He is dead.
- What are you saying?

872
02:13:57,504 --> 02:14:02,134
All your friends say that you
are Vijay. Come to your senses.

873
02:14:03,844 --> 02:14:05,812
Friends?

874
02:14:06,847 --> 02:14:08,815
They are not my friends.

875
02:14:09,683 --> 02:14:11,651
They're friends of wealth.

876
02:14:13,453 --> 02:14:15,751
Once they refused to identify me.

877
02:14:17,457 --> 02:14:19,425
But now...

878
02:14:20,727 --> 02:14:23,753
Why turn against yourself
because of false friends?

879
02:14:24,464 --> 02:14:26,932
Why refuse fame and fortune...

880
02:14:27,301 --> 02:14:31,761
...when you can
repudiate those people?

881
02:14:32,139 --> 02:14:36,439
I have no complaint against
them or any human being.

882
02:14:37,311 --> 02:14:39,438
But against a society that...

883
02:14:40,147 --> 02:14:42,274
...denies the right to be human.

884
02:14:42,983 --> 02:14:46,942
That makes a brother
a stranger, a friend an enemy.

885
02:14:47,654 --> 02:14:51,283
I complain against a world
that worships no humans.

886
02:14:51,825 --> 02:14:53,793
But worships idols.

887
02:14:54,661 --> 02:14:57,129
That destroy humans
and tramples them.

888
02:14:58,832 --> 02:15:02,290
Where it is a crime to
share the sorrows of the poor.

889
02:15:03,170 --> 02:15:05,638
Where it is cowardice
to face troubles.

890
02:15:06,673 --> 02:15:10,473
In such a world I shall never
be at peace, Meena.

891
02:15:11,845 --> 02:15:13,745
No peace, ever.

892
02:15:14,615 --> 02:15:17,743
That is why I am going away,
far away.

893
02:16:03,997 --> 02:16:06,295
Did someone call me?

894
02:16:10,337 --> 02:16:12,237
No one called. Sleep.

895
02:16:23,283 --> 02:16:27,083
Gulabo, where are going?
You're feverish.

896
02:16:27,788 --> 02:16:31,246
Someone called me.
Let me go.

897
02:17:25,779 --> 02:17:28,247
I am going far away, Gulabo.

898
02:17:29,449 --> 02:17:31,417
Where?

899
02:17:32,119 --> 02:17:34,246
Where I won't need to go any further.

900
02:17:38,291 --> 02:17:41,089
Is that what you came to say?

901
02:17:45,132 --> 02:17:47,100
Will you come?
