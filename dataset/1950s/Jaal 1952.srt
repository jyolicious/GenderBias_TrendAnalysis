For how much more time
do we have to wait, sir?

17
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,101
I had told you to
stand here, so many times.

18
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,329
And you are
strolling about the place.

19
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,531
This is not your house
where I'm your sister-in-law.

And you are my brother-in-law.

What do you mean, sir I.

24
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,307
When your captain tells you
to do something then do it.

25
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,677
Why should I ask, you ask.

26
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,277
I'll ask about my bike.

27
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,252
Are you afraid, do you
fear them? I'll ask.

28
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:11,127
Mister?
- Mister? Who mister? I'm sir.

29

Sir, when will this door open?

30
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,068
When will this door open?
When will the luggage go?

00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,141
It won't go, it won't go.

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,710
Didn't I tell you that
they won't tell you?

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,108
Lord, Lord. What government?
What police?

34
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,147
Indian police is very good.

35

Don't worry, he must be coming now.

When will the gate open?
- I don't know.

When will the ship set sail?
- I don't know, I don't know.

38

One tight slap I'll give you.

39

You only said that you
wanted to go to Goa, now go.

I married and then Mummy and daddy.

Don't know why my heart
is beating fast today?

46
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,288
Why?
- I don't know.

Go, go and get the
formalities done and come to me.

Go, go.

53
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:44,213
What is this? At least
have a look at our luggage.

54
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,670
Get it fast, come fast, fast.

55
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,831
Get the luggage.

56
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,515
Everything is fine.
Why are you so worried?

57
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:12,515
Just wipe your face. Take this.

58
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,918
Will you wait till the ship leaves?

59
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,524
Yes, don't worry!
I'll be here only. Go.

60
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,687
Goodbye, Tony.
- Goodbye.

61
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,269
Just hope that this
girl doesn't make a mess.

62
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:44,547
Wait.
- Sir?

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,221
Come over here. Open your purse.

Fifty, fifty rupees and
take the whole basket.

67
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,660
What are you saying, Simon?
All the fish for just fifty?

68
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,358
We have fought and got these fish.

69
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,992
Who said fifty?
- I said it.

70
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:15,532
That's good, my tiger, in fifty
you won't even get the basket.

71
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:18,304
Was he counting
the fish or your age?

72
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,574
Move, Simon.
- I moved.

73
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:31,481
Say, say why do you fear, say?

Give me a smile and
you will get 10 more.

85
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:46,392
Maria, let's go.

86
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:53,804
From when did you start
dealing in fishes, sir?

87
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,532
A deal of hearts?

88
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,810
You always feel that
only, heart, love.

89
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:04,074
Maria, that is because
even I have a heart.

90
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,482
And in that heart
there is love for you.

91
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,419
Love?

92
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,421
Don't make fun of love,
Maria. One day even..

93
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,790
..you might have to
cry for this love.

94
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,429
No, Simon, you will
always see me smiling.

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,170
Even I wish for that
you always keep smiling.

96
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,503
Come on, let's go.
- Come on.

97
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,445
Hey old man, have you
seen any girl? - Basket?

98
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,744
You barrack, not basket, girl.

99
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,443
Why? What has happened?

100
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,453
She has run away with the loot.

101
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:45,549
Keep an eye, she had worn a sari.
- Sari?

102
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:57,537
Who is it?
- Who is it, Maria?

103
00:08:57,638 --> 00:09:02,132
Who are you? - Save me sister,
the police are behind me.

104
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,471
Why? What happened?

105
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:07,480
I have run away from home,
my husband is very cruel.

106
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,107
That's why..

107
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:14,145
Did you see any girl?
She was wearing a sari?

108
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,488
No, no.

You devil, you have
troubled me a lot today.

138
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,788
Brother.
- Come on, give me a kiss.

139
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,859
No, brother.
- Give me a kiss.

140
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,792
Come on, come on.

141
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,925
On the other side, come on.

142
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,398
You can go now.

143
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:28,465
Let it be, brother.
I'm no longer a kid now.

144
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,805
If you're not a kid,
are you an old woman?

145
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,075
Do you know, brother, that
in six months I will be 18?

146
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,743
Yes, I'm worried about that as well.

147
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,183
Lisa, come over here.

148
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,153
Lisa? Who is this Lisa?

149
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,748
She is our guest.

150
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,760
And she" her ship
got wrecked and all..

..her friends have separated.

152
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:52,758
So I brought her along with me.

153
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,767
This is my brother,
Carlo. You keep talking to..

154
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,304
..him, I'll get some
clothes from the top.

155
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,777
Lisa, come, Lisa, Lisa.

156
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,792
Come, Lisa, change your clothes"

157

00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,459
Don't know whether
you will like our food.

159
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,532
We are poor people, we
only have fish and rice.

160
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,471
Made it once and eat it twice.

161
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,808
Just see if this is not too wet.

162
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:46,375
You put you sari over
here only? This is silk.

163
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,856
There is no place to dry it.

164
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,826
What a small house we have!

165
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:56,826
We work from
morning to evening and"

166
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,558
"then we have food and go to sleep.

167
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,959
That's what our life is all about.

168
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:08,397
Brother likes to stay over here,
sometimes he talks to people.

169
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,068
Otherwise what is kept over here?

170
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:14,244
Two small rooms and a terrace.

171
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:18,077
Your house must be very nice.
Where is your house?

172
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:24,319
In Bombay. Bombay? I've heard
it is a very beautiful city.

173
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,925
Don't know whether
I'll ever get to see it.

174
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:36,402
That's good, your whole
appearance has changed.

175
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,565
Come on, let's have dinner.
Just get this.

176
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,533
Brother?
- Yes.

177
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,873
a is looking so
beautiful in these clothes"

178
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,275
"what should I tell you?

179
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,917
A person is not good or bad
depending upon his clothes.

180
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,884
A good person is one
who has a good heart..

181
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:55,250
..who does good deeds.

182
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,188
That's good, brother,
you talk like the father.

183
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,885
Have a seat, Lisa sit.

184
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,054
Brother, I have got the plate.

185
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:14,907
Bless us oh Lord and
give us only that"

186
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:18,034
"what we deserve, thank
you, Lord. Amen. - Amen.

187
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:24,974
I'll find her, where will
she escape and run away.

188
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:33,186
You people are
having dinner, eat, eat!

189
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,325
Gomes, you also come and join us.

190
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,989
No, thanks, I was
just passing from here.

191
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,930
I got some good
smell so I thought that..

192
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,593
...I'll go and have a
few words with Carlo.

193
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:45,638
If you want to eat, eat
but the food is not fresh.

194
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,198
Maria, what is fresh
and what is stale?

195
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,973
You have made it, if you
insist, I'll taste it.

196
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,021
Don't feel shy, you'll also eat.

197
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:11,258
Good, good, Maria. You
cook excellent fish.

198
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,298
Eat, brother.

199
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,042
My God, what a huge storm that was.

200
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,044
A storm like this had
come many years before.

201
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:30,641
You might not remember it,
you were very small then.

202
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,418
In this storm only Carlo"

203
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,654
Maria, who is this?

204
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,328
She is our guest, Miss Lisa.

205
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:50,071
I see, she is a guest,
then can you pass the sauce.

206
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,074
Thank you.

207
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,009
Yes, so I was saying
that in the chaos"

208
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:03,049
..of the storm, that girl escaped.

209
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,680
Yes, so what were you saying, Gomes?

210
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,087
Nothing, there was this
girl who managed to escape.

211
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,386
But where will she go?

212
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:15,622
Wherever she goes I
will get my hands on her.

213
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:20,030
My name is Gomes.

214
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,364
But who was she? What happened?

215
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:25,461
She was a scoundrel, but
she was wearing good clothes.

216
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,770
She was running away with gold.
- Gold?

217
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:35,509
I have told everyone. She
had worn a nice sari, of silk.

218
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:46,383
Sari?
- You are wanted at home, fast.

219
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:49,061
Why did you not tell me earlier?

220
00:18:50,164 --> 00:18:52,633
Okay, Maria, I'll take your leave.

221
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:57,400
Goodnight, Carlo.
- Goodnight, Gomes. - Goodnight.

222
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,472
Maria, Maria.

223
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,568
Wait for a minute, I'm on my way.

224
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:25,157
What is the reason? Why
don't you come with me?

225
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,422
My head is paining.

226
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:31,555
You have a headache or a heartache?

227
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:37,903
You must be thinking
that we are simple people.

228
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,234
We won't know of anything.

229
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:44,507
But don't try to take
advantage of our simplicity.

230
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,911
We maybe poor but we are honest.

231
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:50,182
I know. Once upon a
time even I used to..

232
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:52,912
"stay in a decent house like yours.

233
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,380
Anyway, it is a very long story,
I'll tell you some other time.

234
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,454
Maria, I'm coming, brother.

235
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:04,265
Maria, I will never forget
this obligation of yours.

236
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,199
Come, let me give you this necklace.

237
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:11,533
Are you trying to
fulfill the obligation?

238
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,569
You did not understand me, Maria.

239
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,838
Good morning, father.
- Good morning.

240
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,895
What happened?
- Say Geeta, don't feel shy.

241
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:46,302
Tell me.
- You won't tell anyone, will you?

242
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,567
No.

243
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,736
I was walking by the
edge of the road and then"

244
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,244
And then what happened?

245
00:21:53,347 --> 00:21:55,247
And then he stopped me.

246
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,908
And then what happened?

247
00:21:57,351 --> 00:22:00,981
He stopped me and
then he held my hand.

248
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:04,256
For the past two hours
you are saying that..

249
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:06,258
..he stopped you and held your hand.

250
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,657
Come on, we're getting late.

251
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:27,610
You? Have you come
to make a new deal?

252
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:33,616
Yes, brand new, and priceless.

253
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:36,618
How much did you earn
in yesterday's deal?

254
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,021
Didn't earn anything
and lost everything.

255
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:40,417
In such deals a man has to lose"

256
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:41,892
"something to get something.

257
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:47,294
This hand is very beautiful
and even you are very beautiful.

258
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:50,029
I wish I were this chain.
- Leave me now.

259
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:52,372
Someone might see.
- Where are you going?

260
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:56,968
Inside, won't you come?

261
00:22:57,411 --> 00:23:02,713
Me? Over there? Only the
weak people go over there.

262
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,987
Weak are those people
who fear to go inside.

263
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:16,659
'If anyone speaks
bad, don't listen.'

264
00:23:16,764 --> 00:23:21,326
'Don't speak if someone does wrong.'

265
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:26,066
'Stop if someone is doing wrong'

266
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,973
'Forgive if
someone makes a mistake.'

267
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:34,344
Man is a statue of mistakes.

268
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,816
We all make mistakes.

269
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:43,413
That is why we cannot punish
others for their mistakes.

270
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:48,587
Our mistakes were
washed by the Lord himself.

271
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:52,654
For our well being he
climbed onto the cross.

272
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:55,497
And he went and met the creator.

273
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,407
That same creator has the
records to all our sins.

274
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:04,672
Only he can decide what is
right and what is wrong.

275
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:08,380
He only is the one who
punished for a mistake.

276
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:11,110
And he is the one who forgives.

277
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:15,718
That is why we all lower
our heads in front of him.

278
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,950
And we pray to him that
he forgives all our sins.

279
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,635
So, you have come back? I
knew you were going to come.

280
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:37,006
Where is the gold?

281
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,045
Forget all this, come
on, let's go somewhere.

282
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,409
Where is the gold?

283
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:45,645
So you have not come for me.

284
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:49,489
Come in the evening,
I'll get it to you.

285
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,025
I want it now, go
and get it immediately.

286
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:03,163
Father.
- Yes, daughter.

287
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:05,938
I want to ask you something.
- Ask.

288
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:11,009
You said that we cannot
punish anyone for their crime.

289
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,877
And we can only forgive them.
- Yes, daughter.

290
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,447
If we know that someone
has done wrong and we know..

291
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:21,454
"about it, then what should we do?

292
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:24,855
We should leave everything upon Him.

293
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,588
'Stop if someone
walks on the wrong path.'

294
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,034
"Stealthily to come
to my area is bad."

295
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:39,800
"Leaving without
talking to me is bad."

296
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:43,639
"Stealthily to come
to my area is bad."

297
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:47,203
"Leaving without
talking to me is bad."

298
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:02,495
"These signals are not good."

299
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:05,793
"There is something
going on in my mind."

300
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,836
"Don't come over
here to have a chat."

301
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:13,066
"Or to flirt around with me."

302
00:26:13,607 --> 00:26:16,599
"The heart is for
loving and having fun."

303
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:20,237
"The heart is for
loving and having fun."

304
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:24,511
"Listen, it is bad to
trouble an innocent soul."

305
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,920
"Stealthily to come
to my area is bad."

306
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:33,618
"Leaving without
talking to me is bad."

307
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:11,620
"My heart has come
on you, handsome."

308
00:27:11,732 --> 00:27:14,827
"What is the fear of
getting embarrassed?"

309
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:17,563
"What place does
fear and hatred have"

310
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:22,040
..in the world of love and trust."

311
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,578
"The heart is for
loving and having fun."

312
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,274
"The heart is for
loving and having fun."

313
00:27:29,383 --> 00:27:33,320
"Listen, it is bad to
trouble an innocent soul."

314
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:38,989
"Stealthily to come
to my area is bad."

315
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:42,688
"Leaving without
talking to me is bad."

316
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,360
"The heart is for
loving and having fun."

317
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,994
"The heart is for
loving and having fun."

318
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:27,631
"Listen, it is bad to
trouble an innocent soul."

319
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:33,202
"Stealthily to come
to my area is bad."

320
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:36,908
"Leaving without
talking to me is bad."

321
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:40,647
"Stealthily to come
to my area is bad."

322
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:44,247
"Leaving without
talking to me is bad."

323
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,004
Tony, a weird thing happened.

324
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,407
Where is the gold?

325
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,172
The gold is not there,
someone has taken it.

326
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:08,678
Where had you kept it?

327
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,682
Outside the house,
someone must have..

328
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
"seen me keeping it over there.

329
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:15,686
If the police come to know,
will you save me, Tony?

330
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:19,157
What do I know? That
is you and your work.

331
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:23,695
I'm all alone over here, Tony,
don't leave me alone and go.

332
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:25,162
Tony, TO"!!-

333
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:32,738
Yes, brother, this is the same gold.

334
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:35,775
I had seen her
hiding it in the night.

335
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,436
And as soon as I could, I
removed it and got it here.

336
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:40,710
If someone would
have seen it, then God..

337
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:44,148
"knows what would have happened?

338
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,730
My heart had told me
before that this girl..

339
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:02,132
..will come as a
trouble and not as a guest.

340
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:05,737
And when Gomes had
said that she was"

341
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,807
"wearing a sari, then
something struck me.

342
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,398
That she might be the thief.

343
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:12,869
She doesn't look like a thief.

344
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:15,747
Whatever she has done
who knows under what".

345
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:19,251
"circumstances she
must have done it.

346
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,754
Whoever commits a
crime should be punished.

347
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,755
And this will be
decided by the police only.

348
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:28,121
Who are we to decide what
is good and what is bad?

349
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,764
Our duty is only to stop a person"

350
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:36,302
..from going on the wrong path.

351
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,430
Maria, you don't understand.

352
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:43,776
Th is that spark that will
create an explosion one day.

353
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:45,777
And in that
explosion she will burn..

354
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:48,780
..our house and it's happiness.

355
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:50,441
No, brother, don't say such a thing.

356
00:30:50,551 --> 00:30:53,145
Why shouldn't I? She
is a thief, a scoundrel.

357
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:54,911
There is no place
for her in this house.

358
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,046
Brother.

359
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:05,093
Fine, I am a thief and there is no
place for me in this house.

360
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,802
I am that spark that can
cause an entire explosion.

361
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:13,804
But don't worry, brother,
nothing will happen to the..

362
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:17,935
"house that has given me shelter.

363
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,878
I will go away from here.
- Wait.

364
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:24,349
You can't go from here,
the police are coming.

365
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,475
Police?

366
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:28,521
Yes, I have sent Simon
to inform the police.

367
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,549
You did a good thing.

368
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:44,529
Whatever a person does
he has to pay for it.

369
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,840
Even I did wrong.
But once upon a time"

370
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:50,842
..even I was a good and decent girl.

371
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:55,108
Even I had a house,
parents, a life of happiness.

372
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:58,179
Then all of a sudden he
came in my life like a storm.

373
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:01,186
And he trapped me in his golden net.

374
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:06,392
Then I left my household
and I came into his world.

375
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:07,858
I did everything
for his love, even..

376
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,554
"the things I shouldn't have.

377
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:13,866
To the limit that I started
to rob and cheat. All for him.

378
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:16,993
And that man?

379
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,372
What's the use of
saying anything now?

380
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:25,878
If I ever meet him,
I'll break his neck.

381
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,575
On which lucky person are you
going to do this favor, Maria?

382
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:33,419
With your permission, my
neck is at your service.

383
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,182
If you do so, I'll get an
entry straight to heaven.

384
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:40,117
Why are all of you'll so quiet?

385
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,053
Did you called me over, Carlo?

386
00:32:48,001 --> 00:32:51,562
All the villages and
district are in your favor.

387
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:53,632
Maria?

388
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:10,457
Come and have lunch?

389
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:11,922
Wait let me change first.

390
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:16,664
After falling for you all my
life I'll cry on my destiny.

391
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,658
Why, is it okay?

392
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,932
Maria, why are you so quiet?

393
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:26,438
What did you say? I didn't hear you?

394
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,408
I was saying that if I go
what is going to happen of you.

395
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:51,361
If such a thing happens,
then what will you do?

396
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:54,696
There is no shortage of water,
I'll go there and jump inside.

397
00:33:54,802 --> 00:33:58,966
Tell me beforehand,
I'll properly find you.

398
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:02,974
You also, Maria, here, have food.

399
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,477
Simon, you did not get water?

400
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:07,979
I forgot, I'll get it right away.

401
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:23,127
What is this shamelessness?

402
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:25,997
Am I a cattle that
you put a rope around..

403
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,124
me and pulled me?

404
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:28,463
What do you want?

405
00:34:33,374 --> 00:34:36,002
So, you don't know what I want?
- No.

406
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,013
Whenever say yes.
- Oh yes!

407
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:43,743
And when they say no then it
means yes. - Anything more?

408
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:46,018
She says tail.

409
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:52,025
I like you a lot.
- So soon? - Yes, only a..

410
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:57,587
"first sight was required.

411
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,763
Do you only keep following
girls or do you also do some work?

412
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:05,196
Nothing, right now. But
lam searching for a job.

413
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,043
But you used to sell fishes.
- Yes, but it was not profitable.

414
00:35:10,144 --> 00:35:13,045
So I am thinking of
casting fishes instead.

415
00:35:13,147 --> 00:35:16,048
What do you say?
Will it be profitable?

416
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,118
Yes, it would be profitable.
- Certainly, right?

417
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:22,213
Then inform Simon he
is in need of keys.

418
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:23,380
Should I inform Simon?

419
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:38,603
"I have already given my heart."

420
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:43,701
"I have already given my heart."

421
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:50,148
"Forget it. Forget it.
Avoid your romantic poetry."

422
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:56,212
"Forget it. Avoid
your romantic poetry."

423
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:15,199
"I lost my heart at first sight."

424
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:20,543
"I lost my heart at first sight."

425
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:25,846
"I am floored by your graces."

426
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,454
"Now it's hard to find interest
in something else besides you."

427
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:38,461
"Forget it. Forget it.
Avoid your romantic poetry."

428
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:56,877
"Go wash your face and
don't try to entrap me."

429
00:36:57,251 --> 00:37:02,155
"Go wash your face and
don't try to entrap me."

430
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:07,417
"lam not going to
be conned by you."

431
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:13,166
"This is an old trick.
This is an old trick."

432
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:17,829
"I have already given my heart."

433
00:37:28,282 --> 00:37:32,776
"You have stolen my
heart and now you deny it."

434
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:38,185
"You have stolen my
heart and now you deny it."

435
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:43,389
"People who die on
you will really die."

436
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:48,599
"Stop throwing
tantrums on my heart."

437
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:54,207
"Forget it. Forget it.
Avoid your romantic poetry."

438
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:10,316
"You find Romeo at every step.
You find Romeo at every step."

439
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:17,230
"How can you believe them?"

440
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:22,360
"Everyone give the
same excuse of love."

441
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,962
"l have already"

442
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:31,710
"I have already given my heart."

443
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:35,941
"Everyone give the
same excuse of love."

444
00:38:39,353 --> 00:38:46,851
What‘ s the matter?

445
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:53,334
What are they asking?
- He is asking for gold.

446
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:56,267
And he is asking for his share.
- Ok, tell them they'll get it.

447
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:01,331
And he is asking for his share.
- Ok, tell them they'll get it.

448
00:39:02,376 --> 00:39:05,346
Tell them that if they
don't trust me then.

449
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:06,777
They can find
another man for this job.

450
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:23,793
They are saying that
they do trust you.

451
00:39:23,897 --> 00:39:25,365
And they want to only work with you.

452
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,764
But they also say that you
do nothing but sit idle.

453
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:30,303
lam not sitting idle.
But I am doing some work.

454
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:32,668
lam thinking of a
new trick tell them.

455
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,741
And I'll let them know
when I feel the time is right.

456
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:56,522
Go, now you too get lost.
- Sir, give me 5 rupees.

457
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,999
My family is starving.
- I said I don't have. Now get lost.

458
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,374
Go take it from there.

459
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:21,786
Uncle, this sudden change in whethe
r can cause problems.

460
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,914
Yes, brother lots of problems.

461
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,984
We won't be able
to get into the sea.

462
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,828
And here on the shore the Material.

463
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:33,363
And I have not saved a penny.

464
00:40:34,468 --> 00:40:37,369
Now God only knows how
I'll survive these days.

465
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,997
Don't worry, uncle.
Everything will be fine.

466
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:50,383
Antonio! Paul!

467
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:58,015
Where had you gone, Maria?
- I was lost.

468
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:02,392
The same thing happened
that you told. I was lost.

469
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:04,055
Don't joke Maria.

470
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,494
Who told you? - My friend.
- Ask the one who told you.

471
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:12,538
But I don't have any
work for a man like you.

472
00:41:13,507 --> 00:41:15,498
What do you mean?
- You sometime buy fishes.

473
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,077
You sometime ask for labor charges.

474
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,570
I want an honest man at work.
- What are you saying?

475
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,875
Am I not honest?

476
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:38,487
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

477
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,431
"Take the risk on your life."

478
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:43,504
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

479
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:51,068
"With a lot of hope
and faith in her eyes."

480
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:57,006
"The fisher women is
waiting for you in pleasure."

481
00:41:57,117 --> 00:42:01,054
"With a lot of hope
and faith in her eyes."

482
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:05,058
"With innocence of a
child and love of a mother."

483
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,456
"Row with you full endurance,
fishermen."

484
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,188
"And let not the water creep in."

485
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:14,194
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

486
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:16,195
"Take the risk on your life."

487
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,006
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

488
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,131
"Take the risk on your life."

489
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:31,484
"For generations the
storm has been overhead."

490
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,212
"Storm has been overhead."

491
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:37,490
"Waves and clouds have
been like our companions."

492
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:39,821
"Clouds have been
like our companions."

493
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:43,494
"For generations the
storm has been overhead."

494
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:47,158
"Waves and clouds have
been like our companions."

495
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:49,569
"To carry on is the
motto of our life."

496
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,502
"Don't worry about
the summer and winter."

497
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:55,838
"We shall carry on the work
irrespective of the seasons."

498
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:00,205
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

499
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,048
"Take the risk on your life."

500
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:04,584
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

501
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:05,709
"Take the risk on your life."

502
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:17,530
"Who knows when there
is a whirlpool or rain?"

503
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,531
"When there is a rain?"

504
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,539
"Who knows when there
is a whirlpool or rain?"

505
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:28,972
"When there is a rain?"

506
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,817
"Think about today's victory
and forget about yesterday."

507
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:40,581
"Tell your arms always
to be enthusiastic

508
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:45,226
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

509
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,286
"Take the risk on your life."

510
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:49,629
"With your full strength.
With your feet on the ground."

511
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,891
"Take the risk on your life."

512
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,599
We have never got so much wealth.

513
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:29,328
Wealth is so nice.

514
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,234
Siamon brother prices very high.

515
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,931
God has heard our pleading.

516
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:34,970
Now this season
will pass peacefully.

517
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,100
A fortunate man receives wealth.

518
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:45,711
Yes, indeed a fortunate man.
- Then will I get the job? - Yes.

519
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:57,356
Hey Maria! You seem to be happy.

520
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:58,693
Have you guys caught something?

521
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:01,700
Brother, don't ask anything.
The fishing net was too heavy.

522
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:03,964
Even applying the strength to
the fullest, couldn't pull the net.

523
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:07,268
Simon, George, Charlie
everyone were there.

524
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:12,710
But none could succeed. So I
thought I would help them out.

525
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:16,215
And as soon as I touched
the net, it was pulled out.

526
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,151
Brother, the net was full of fishes.

527
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:22,655
And the fishes were shining,
as they were to be of silver.

528
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:26,090
Now we are rich. Let the
rainy season begin today.

529
00:45:26,193 --> 00:45:28,753
We have no fear.
- Maria, thank God.

530
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:33,700
Besides God there is one
person to be thanked. - Who?

531
00:45:33,801 --> 00:45:37,829
Come in Tony.
- Tony? Who is Tony?

532
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:42,731
Hi! I am Tony Fernandez. May
God grant you a peaceful life!

533
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,677
From today onwards he too
will be working with us.

534
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:49,147
We had to plead to
Simon to give him the job.

535
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:52,753
Very well, Maria. Tell him
to have his meals with us.

536
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:56,414
Tell Lisa to cook for him.
- Food is ready.

537
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,191
Come on, brother.
- Come on, Maria. - Come on, Tony.

538
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:09,134
Tony, come here.
Haven't I given you the job?

539
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:12,204
Now you don't come
in that girl's route.

540
00:46:13,807 --> 00:46:20,270
You and that girl have different
routes. - And what about you?

541
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:24,717
My route is same as hers.
- But be careful.

542
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:27,878
There might be thorns on the way.

543
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:31,814
You don't worry about the thorns.
I'll take care of them.

544
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,427
Tony, your talks are comical. To w
hich village, you belong?

545
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:44,805
Baghdev, it's just
behind the mountains.

546
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:50,435
We used to do farming there.
But we lost everything.

547
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:54,747
And then when I was mature enough,
I migrated to Mumbai city.

548
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:00,252
There is everything in
Mumbai city. But not what is here.

549
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:07,123
And that is peace.
- Tony! It might be alive?

550
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:16,767
- Tony, I.. I..

551
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:36,787
Great! You got a chance
to entertain everyone.

552
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:42,124
But you had left this place,
then why did you return?

553
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:46,799
You want to understand
this matter. Understood.

554
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:53,873
You are here to find peace of mind.

555
00:47:55,909 --> 00:48:03,909
"Maria!
- Maria! - Maria! - Maria!"

556
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,894
"Laugh, sing and enjoy yourselves."

557
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:22,995
"Word is water"..

558
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:34,574
"Ma" Ma.. Maria! Ma..
Ma.. Maria! Ma.. Ma.. Maria!"

559
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:36,843
"Ma" Ma.. Maria! Ma..
Ma.. Maria! Ma.. Ma.. Maria!"

560
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,942
"Maria!
- Maria! - Maria! - Maria!"

561
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:56,962
"Far away a star is indicating.
Far away a star is indicating

562
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:12,214
"That the one who has lost
everything is the winner at last."

563
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:17,223
"There is storm in my heart.
And I feel like dying."

564
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:20,123
"I don't know what
kind of wish is this?"

565
00:49:20,227 --> 00:49:22,992
"Laugh, sing and enjoy yourselves."

566
00:49:23,097 --> 00:49:27,898
"Say whatever in your
heart to your beloved..

567
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:32,906
..as the night is romantic.
- What kind of crave is this?"

568
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:47,419
"Ma" Ma.. Maria! Ma..
Ma.. Maria! Ma.. Ma.. Maria!"

569
00:49:47,521 --> 00:49:51,651
"Ma" Ma.. Maria! Ma..
Ma.. Maria! Ma.. Ma.. Maria!"

00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:53,955
"Maria!
- Maria! - Maria! - Maria!"

571
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:09,534
"Your city is too far
and the road is lonely."

572
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:18,281
"Your city is too far
and the road is lonely."

573
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:27,685
"My companion, don't ever ditch me."

574
00:50:28,062 --> 00:50:32,295
"There is storm in my heart.
And I feel like dying."

575
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:35,630
"I don't know what
kind of wish is this?"

576
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,038
"Laugh, sing and enjoy yourselves."

"Just tell my beloved to accept me."

584
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:51,101
Listen there is a dark shadow
that is going to over cast you.

585
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:53,646
And you'll be able to see nothing.

586
00:51:53,747 --> 00:51:56,114
What kind of shadow?
Say something more.

587
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:57,377
That shadow will have spots on it.

588
00:51:57,484 --> 00:51:59,714
Spots of someone's blood on it.

589
00:52:10,164 --> 00:52:12,064
Hey! What will you get by shooting"

590
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:15,761
"someone who is already dead?

591

Aim there and you
might get some prize?

592
00:52:21,175 --> 00:52:28,081
Hold it here. Now aim.
And focus with ..

593

"this pointer. Shoot!

594

1 ,2. You shoot very well.
- Oh! You were shooting, Maria?

595
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:51,400
Aim, aim, you should
join the Police with us.

596
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,098
We need good shooters like you.
- I too think the same.

597
00:52:53,207 --> 00:52:55,107
You seem to be very learned.

598
00:52:56,877 --> 00:53:01,280
If I am not wrong then we
are meeting for the first time?

599
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:06,114
Yes, unfortunately never got a ch
ance too meet.. - He is..

600
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,157
our inspector Mr..

601
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:14,251
And he is.. - Constable. -
And brother-in-law also. Come on.

602
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:17,194
Will you have cigarette?
- No. - He is Tony.

603
00:53:17,298 --> 00:53:21,132
He works with us and
he is from Mumbai.

604
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:25,695
He works with us and
he is from Mumbai.

605
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,699
Yes, ask.
- No, need not bother right now.

606
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:34,477
Any ways I'll find that girl.
- Which girl?

607
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:36,550
The one who ran away
with all the gold?

608
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:39,676
Yes, the same girl. But now we ha
ve come to know about Whaa.

609
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:43,223
Who is Whaa? - Whaa is the
one who helped the girl.

610
00:53:43,324 --> 00:53:48,455
To steal those gold.
- Jerk! - Come on, Tony.

611
00:53:49,263 --> 00:53:50,492
Let's go for a ride.
- Yes.

612
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:19,857
Stay away from Tony.
- Why? -

613
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,553
What do you mean?.

614
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:32,065
It's easy to recognize a snake.

615
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:37,235
But it's difficult to
understand Tony. - What do you mean?

616
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:41,210
How well do you know Tony?
- I know him very well.

617
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:52,859
You remember once I told you that"

618
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,329
..a cheater spoiled my life?
Tony is that cheater, Maria.

619
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:01,196
Tony is that man?
- Yes, Maria.

620
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:29,894
Maria! Where had you been? ..

621
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:35,629
- Simon! Hello, Simon.

622
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:42,033
What's wrong with you Maria?
- Why? Nothing.

623
00:55:42,142 --> 00:55:44,907
One never knows whether you
are awake or you are sleeping?

624
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:54,079
Should I ask you something, Simon?
- Yes, Maria.

625
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:57,923
Have you ever loved someone?

626
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:02,519
You don't love someone,
Maria. But you fall in love.

627
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,990
How? - All I know is
that love is such a fire.

628
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:12,198
That you can't light
nor can you extinguish.

629
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:15,435
And the same fire is
burning in my heart.

630
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:22,209
And you have lighted it.
- What are you saying, Simon?

631
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:25,684
This can't be possible. This
can't be possible. - Maria!

632
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:53,980
Who is it?! You.
- You got scared? ..

633
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:58,518
- I knew you would come.

634
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,988
Oh yes!
- Just like the impatient"

635
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,993
waves rush towards the shore.

636
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,326
Just as a moth is
attracted to the light.

637
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,729
The same way you'll come to me.

638
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:21,632
I am not here to given
my life like a moth.

639
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:26,637
I am here to ask you to leave.

640
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:31,710
As one dirty fish
spoils the whole pond.

641
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,093
Till yesterday I was like
an angel of mercy to you.

642
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,390
And today I have
become a dirty fish?

643
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:48,591
ls this what you have come to say?
- Yes. - Lies.

644
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,507
You are here because you love me.

645
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:59,179
And you can't be far
from me for a long time.

646
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:08,577
This all is false.
- You are cheating yourself, Maria.

647
00:58:10,757 --> 00:58:17,788
I don't know how to cheat like you.
- Oh! Understood.

648
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:22,693
Maria, good or bad at
last we all are humans.

649
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,332
The one who is good
today can be bad tomorrow.

650
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:29,302
And the one who is bad
today can be good tomorrow.

651
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:34,580
And Maria I may be good or bad.

652
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:41,144
But whatever I am. I am
yours and you are mine.

653
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,420
You know to con very well.
- Maria!

654
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:49,094
And you know too entrap people also.

655
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:52,495
But I am not going to be conned.

656
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,536
You can't deny that
you too love me. Maria!

657
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:07,170
People get hurt in love.
- But that's the fun, Maria.

658
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:14,780
What a romantic night i is Mari .
And you'll come to me tonight.

659
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:19,416
No I won't. - Yes, you will,
Maria. - No, I won't. I won't.

660
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:23,861
You will come I know. - I won't. -
Your intelligence will stop you.

661
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:32,231
But your emotions will bring you
here. You'll come to this door.

662
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,872
And then the moonlight
will play with your tresses.

663
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:44,843
And the wind will kiss your cheeks.

664
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:48,745
And you'll be lost in my thoughts.

665
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:52,556
Then with a soft voice
you'll call out Tony.

666
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:58,164
No, I won't come.
- I know you'll come.

667
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:05,562
"Where will you find such a
beautiful night and moonlight?"

668
01:00:05,672 --> 01:00:10,200
"Come, listen to the
tale of my heart."

669
01:00:29,697 --> 01:00:35,659
"Where will you find such a
beautiful night and moonlight?"

670
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:40,172
"Come, listen to the
tale of my heart."

671
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:07,968
"On these bark of trees"
on these bark of trees."

672
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:13,700
"Are resting the moon light.
Are resting the moon light."

673
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:21,981
"And they are lost
in your thoughts."

674
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:28,044
"And after some time
they'll go away, disappointed."

675
01:01:28,155 --> 01:01:33,321
"And this romantic night
won't come back again."

676
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:39,161
"This atmosphere is going to
last for only few moments."

677
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:44,329
"Come, listen to the
tale of my heart."

678
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:13,125
"Even the waves" even the
waves are singing a love song."

679
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:25,137
"Even the waves" even the
moist winds have fire in it."

680
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:34,448
"You also get burnt
in this fire of love."

681
01:02:34,555 --> 01:02:39,721
"And change the tune of your life."

682
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:45,095
"You'll have to hear
to my hearts language."

683
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:50,501
"Come, listen to the
tale of my heart."

684
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:21,460
"These passing winds.. these
passing winds are very exciting."

685
01:03:31,211 --> 01:03:36,775
"Let's share a story
in this moon light."

686
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:42,118
"If they go away
after calling you then..

687
01:03:42,222 --> 01:03:48,161
"This romantic
atmosphere won't ever return."

688
01:03:54,234 --> 01:04:00,139
"If they go away
after calling you then..

689
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:05,838
"This romantic
atmosphere won't ever return."

690
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:11,146
"Come to me as still we are young."

691
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:16,720
"Come, listen to the
tale of my heart."

692
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:23,160
"Where will you find such a
beautiful night and moonlight?"

693
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:31,263
"Come, listen to the tale of my hea
rt. Tale. Tale. Tale."

694
01:06:07,368 --> 01:06:13,273
Did something fall in your eyes?
- Yes, maybe.

695
01:06:23,384 --> 01:06:30,290
Tony, I love you. And you can't ..

696
01:06:30,391 --> 01:06:33,691
"hate the person you love.

697
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,665
You'll call me and I won't
come. Can this be possible?

698
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:48,033
Maria!
- What's the matter? - Nothing.

699
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:51,305
Something fell in her eyes.
I am just removing it.

700
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:58,713
Ok, remove, remove. Remove it, sir.

701
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:01,948
Sir, how are you?
What about your Whaa?

702
01:07:03,424 --> 01:07:07,657
Sir. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir.
- Sir. - Sir. - Sir. - Sir.

703
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:14,925
What were you saying, sir? - I
was asking, sir, what about Whaa?

704
01:07:15,436 --> 01:07:19,339
Sir, if I find that girl then
I'll automatically find the boy.

705
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,738
Sir, if I find that girl then
I'll automatically find the Whaa.

706
01:07:21,842 --> 01:07:27,804
So sir, are you running after
that guy? - Sir, what to run?

707
01:07:28,449 --> 01:07:31,908
lam planning to trap
him by staying calm.

708
01:07:32,453 --> 01:07:39,917
Sir, you are remark less.
- Listen!

709
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:42,361
I have asked for the
photo of some jerks from..

710
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:44,989
"Head quarters. Once
if I get those photos.

711
01:07:45,466 --> 01:07:51,098
Then I'll see how far that
pair can run away from my claws?

712
01:07:53,474 --> 01:07:58,036
Sir, they can escape
from the claws of others.

713
01:07:58,145 --> 01:08:00,375
But how can they
escape the claws of John.

714
01:08:00,481 --> 01:08:02,449
Fernando.

715
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:05,041
Sir.
- Sir..

716
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:07,951
Sir, do you know them?
- No, sir.

717
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:22,134
These Arabs are pestering
me in Hindi and English.

718
01:08:24,571 --> 01:08:26,403
May God's peace be upon you!

719
01:08:26,507 --> 01:08:27,736
May God's peace be upon you too!

720
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:28,933
May God's peace be upon you too!

721
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:32,138
Let them ask what they want to.

722
01:08:41,522 --> 01:08:42,853
They are asking
what about your plan?

723
01:08:43,524 --> 01:08:46,960
How long do we have to stay here?

724
01:08:47,161 --> 01:08:50,096
Until when are we going
to waste our time here?

725
01:08:50,197 --> 01:08:52,495
Tell them that all the
arrangements are done.

726
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:55,662
Now we will take the
gold via the open sea.

727
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:15,045
They are asking, from
where will the boat come?

728
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:16,520
Tell them that they are donkeys.

729
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:17,647
You are donkeys!

730
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:18,782
Tell them in Arabic.

731
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,593
Let it be or else they
will get unnecessarily angry.

732
01:09:21,695 --> 01:09:28,829
Tony's arrangements never
fail and Maria is also stuck.

733
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:35,475
I have thought of a
plan that there will..

734
01:09:35,576 --> 01:09:40,537
not be any quarrels for Tasneem"

735
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:43,640
Nor there will be
the fear of the police.

736
01:09:46,587 --> 01:09:47,816
We did not understand.

737
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:48,946
Make them understand.

738
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:55,927
Arab sir, the matter is
that you will come with us.

739
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:57,621
You did not understand.

740
01:09:57,731 --> 01:09:59,495
I will have to make
you understand in Arabic.

741
01:10:15,616 --> 01:10:23,616
Maria! Where are you going, Maria?
- Nowhere.

742
01:10:27,228 --> 01:10:28,252
Are you going to meet Tony?

743
01:10:30,631 --> 01:10:32,531
How many times have I
made you understand"

744
01:10:32,633 --> 01:10:35,534
..that don't play with fire
or else you will get burnt.

745
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,540
There's real
enjoyment in getting burnt.

746
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:44,543
Maria! Whichever flower
he saw and liked, he..

747
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:47,205
..broke it, smelt it and
crushed it under his feet.

748
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:49,548
Just look at me, that scoundrel"

749
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:51,618
"used me and ditched me.

750
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:56,986
You are saying this because
you have been ditched in love.

751
01:10:57,658 --> 01:11:02,220
He does not love you. He loves me.

752
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:04,153
He has told me himself.

753
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:06,633
It is very easy to
show love for someone.

754
01:11:06,734 --> 01:11:08,566
But is difficult to fulfil it.

755
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:12,572
He does not love anyone.
He just loves money.

756
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:14,573
And for money he will
sell his self esteem"

757
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:16,609
"and he will sell you too.

758
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,902
No, you will not do this!

759
01:11:43,003 --> 01:11:46,598
You will not ditch me!
- Hello!

760
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:54,075
Tony! Tony! Do you love me?

761
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:59,278
Yes. You will not ditch me. ls it?

762
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,679
No. - You will not crush me
under your feet. Will you?

763
01:12:05,326 --> 01:12:09,627
Maria, do you love me?
- Yes.

764
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:17,631
No. If you do love me then ..

765
01:12:17,738 --> 01:12:21,265
..why do you doubt me?

766
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:27,644
No, no, Tony I have no
doubts on you. I love you.

767
01:12:27,748 --> 01:12:32,914
I love you more than myself.
I can do anything for you.

768
01:12:35,756 --> 01:12:37,884
Anything? Yes, Tony.

769
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:47,666
Look what I have got for you.

770
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:55,003
All these are for me!
- Yes.

771
01:12:57,778 --> 01:12:59,246
How gorgeous is this necklace!

772
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:04,841
Tony, you are very nice.

773
01:13:06,787 --> 01:13:08,016
You quickly change your clothes.

774
01:13:08,122 --> 01:13:09,681
Till then I will tell you a story.

775
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:13,993
There was once a boy and a girl.

776
01:13:14,094 --> 01:13:16,119
It was just recently
that they got married.

777
01:13:16,797 --> 01:13:17,923
Both were poor.

778
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:21,894
But both were willing to
give their lives for each other.

779
01:13:26,473 --> 01:13:28,703
She was proud of her
long and beautiful tresses.

780
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,710
If the world wanted"

781
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:47,192
The boy had a gold watch,
who was also very proud of it.

782
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:50,354
But, because it did not have a st
rap he could not wear it.

783
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:55,063
And the poor fellow did not
have money to buy the strap.

784
01:13:56,837 --> 01:13:58,737
Christmas was just
round the corner"

785
01:13:58,839 --> 01:14:01,740
"and the girl wanted to buy
a gold strap for her husband.

786
01:14:02,843 --> 01:14:03,867
Even after saving
each and every penny..

787
01:14:03,978 --> 01:14:05,412
"she could not
collect that much money.

788
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:09,749
The girl was worried.
She was mad in love..

789
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:13,809
"and the girl went and
cut her hair and sold it.

790
01:14:13,921 --> 01:14:16,754
And she bought a gold
strap for her husband.

791
01:14:16,857 --> 01:14:18,086
Then what happened?

792
01:14:18,192 --> 01:14:19,216
It was the night of Christmas.

793
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,760
The husband came home and saw his"

794
01:14:21,862 --> 01:14:24,456
..wife and was astonished.

795
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:27,398
And asked what
happened to your tresses?

796
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:30,769
The wife smiled and said look, I
have got a good strap for you.

797
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:32,396
Now you can wear your watch.

798
01:14:32,873 --> 01:14:34,773
But, what happened to your tresses?

799
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:36,843
I sold it.
- Why?

800
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:39,778
Because I wanted to
buy a strap for you.

801
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:43,782
The boy's face frowned and said"

802
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:46,785
..what will I do with this
strap. I also had to buy..

803
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:49,788
..a gift for you. I
sold my watch and"

804
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,292
"bought you a silver comb.

805
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:01,061
How much they loved
each other, isn't it?

806
01:15:03,904 --> 01:15:07,807
How I wish I could have
done something for you!

807
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:18,384
Maria! - Tony! Tony, no power in th
is world can separate us.

808
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,820
Yes, it will happen.
And this is the power.

809
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:24,516
Look at it carefully.

810
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:27,994
This is the thing, which you
love above all in this world.

811
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:31,827
How lovely is the shine that
you cannot keep your eyes off it.

812
01:15:31,932 --> 01:15:34,299
You cannot see anything before this.

813
01:15:34,401 --> 01:15:37,166
This is your life
and your self-esteem.

814
01:15:37,938 --> 01:15:39,838
You have ditched
me because of this"

815
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:41,840
"and who knows how
many girl's like..

816
01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:42,966
"Maria you have spoilt.

817
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:52,851
Why are you talking so negatively?

818
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:55,183
You want to take revenge from me.

819
01:15:56,957 --> 01:15:59,858
Whatever you
wanted I could not give.

820
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:05,364
That is why, what I like you
want to steal away from me.

821
01:16:05,466 --> 01:16:08,094
This is all false.
Don't fall for his words.

822
01:16:08,202 --> 01:16:11,365
Come, Tony. - Maria I
want to save you from Tony.

823
01:16:11,472 --> 01:16:12,871
You have done a favour on me by..

824
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:14,498
"saving my life and
giving me shelter in your house.

825
01:16:14,608 --> 01:16:16,042
That is why I want
to repay your favour.

826
01:16:16,143 --> 01:16:19,340
If you want to repay her favour,
don't waste our time.

827
01:16:19,446 --> 01:16:21,278
Go, run away. Come, Maria.

828
01:16:24,985 --> 01:16:30,890
Maria! Oh! It's you!
Where did you go Lisa?

829
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:34,188
Just for a walk.
- Where is Maria?

830
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:37,555
She must be sleeping upstairs.
- False.

831
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:42,902
I have been wamng here since
evening. Maria is not at home.

832
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:47,372
Why are you quiet? Tell me, Lisa.

833
01:16:47,474 --> 01:16:50,239
What is the matter? Where is Maria?

834
01:16:51,012 --> 01:16:53,606
Simon, you love Maria, isn't it?

835
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:58,178
Lisa, you do not
understand how much I love her.

836
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,980
Then why are you standing over here?

837
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:01,919
Maria is treading a wrong path.

838
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:03,922
Go stop her and
make her understand"

839
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:05,083
..that Tony is not worth her love.

840
01:17:05,192 --> 01:17:10,096
Tony! Maria loves Tony!

841
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:12,928
Yes Simon, she has
forgotten herself"

842
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:15,127
..her family
members and even Carlho.

843
01:17:15,236 --> 01:17:16,931
I tried very hard to
make her understand"

844
01:17:17,038 --> 01:17:18,938
..but she did not listen to me.

845
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,336
Where has she gone?

846
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:21,966
Both have gone for a dance.

847
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:27,344
Simon, Tony is the same
person who spoilt my life.

848
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:30,949
Lisa, what if Carlho listens to it.

849
01:17:39,059 --> 01:17:46,693
Carlho! Carlho! Carlho!
- Maria! Maria!

850
01:18:16,096 --> 01:18:20,055
"Be very careful
when you love someone."

851
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:22,295
"Look, the times are bad."

852
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:26,664
"Don't be deceived
by the innocent face."

853
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:29,243
"Look, the times are bad."

854
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:33,074
"Be very careful
when you love someone."

855
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,047
"Look, the times are bad."

856
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:47,720
"Don't be deceived. Don't be
deceived. Don't be deceived."

857
01:18:48,562 --> 01:18:50,496
"No, no, no, no."

858
01:18:57,738 --> 01:19:01,038
"Tread very carefully you lovers"

859
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:04,111
..when you are passing
through the lane of love."

860
01:19:04,211 --> 01:19:10,776
"There are robbers and
looters moving around in disguise."

861
01:19:12,153 --> 01:19:15,123
"Don't be deceived.
Don't be deceived."

862
01:19:15,823 --> 01:19:18,053
"Look, the times are bad."

863
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,391
"Be very careful
when you love someone."

864
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:25,056
"Look, the times are bad."

865

"Don't be deceived. Don't be
deceived. Don't be deceived."

866
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:39,212
"No, no, no, no."

867
01:19:46,787 --> 01:19:50,087
"In this world, a market place."

868
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:53,182
"It is the thirst of
the body not the soul."

869
01:19:53,294 --> 01:20:00,098
"In this garden of beauty,
there are many colours of lust."

873
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:14,176
"Look, the times are bad."

874

"Don't be deceived. Don't be
deceived. Don't be deceived."

"No, no, no, no."

876
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:42,139
"Love is like a glass bangle.
Just a jerk and its shattered."

877

886
01:21:27,288 --> 01:21:30,588
Beware! If you try to meet Maria.

887
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:55,908
"I think of you so much like the
broken strings of the violin."

888
01:22:04,325 --> 01:22:06,259
"My body is wrapped with the
flames of the fire of love."

889
01:22:07,328 --> 01:22:12,596
"The smoke from the
fire sways in my heart."

890

"Just listen to the
call of my heart."

891
01:22:18,339 --> 01:22:22,640
"Where will be this
night and the moonlight?"

892
01:22:22,743 --> 01:22:26,304
"Just listen to the
call of my heart."

893
01:22:33,354 --> 01:22:39,316
"Where have the star studded
night and the moments of love gone."

894
01:22:39,426 --> 01:22:41,554
"The waves sing the
lost moments of love."

895
01:22:57,378 --> 01:23:05,378
"All the gardens of
hope have been deserted."

896
01:23:07,388 --> 01:23:15,388
"Where should I search for you?
I do not know where you are."

897
01:23:28,409 --> 01:23:36,339
"I do not know where are you lost.
Only the next world knows."

898
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,320
We will come here by the shore"

899
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:42,890
"and we will reach
straight to the border.

900
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,823
Tell them to wait for
me in the boat here.

901
01:23:55,436 --> 01:23:59,395
That is why I have come
here to take you with me.

902
01:24:00,441 --> 01:24:03,604
No, Tony how can this happen?

903
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:07,340
If you love me, anything can happen.

904
01:24:08,449 --> 01:24:11,043
You will come. I have
made all the arrangements.

905
01:24:11,452 --> 01:24:15,582
Tonight you will come to
the beach near the rocks.

906
01:24:15,689 --> 01:24:17,589
I will wait for you.

907
01:24:17,691 --> 01:24:20,991
And across the border there will
be a motorboat waiting for us.

908
01:24:21,095 --> 01:24:23,359
How can I leave, brother?

909
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:25,364
Do you love your brother or me?

910
01:24:26,467 --> 01:24:31,428
I love you Tony, but I am
the light of his vision.

911
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:35,439
If I go away then his
world will be shattered.

912
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:37,374
And anyhow you
will have to one day"

913
01:24:37,478 --> 01:24:40,379
..leave this home and
settle down somewhere else.

914
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:41,505
Come, Mama!

915
01:24:46,487 --> 01:24:50,583
'He does not love anyone.
He just loves wealth.'

916
01:24:50,691 --> 01:24:54,753
'And he can sell himself and
his self esteem for wealth.'

917
01:24:54,862 --> 01:24:56,387
'And you too.'

918
01:24:56,497 --> 01:24:58,397
'Do you remember, I had told you".

919
01:24:58,499 --> 01:24:59,967
..that a scoundrel
had spoilt my life?‘

920
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:01,626
'He crushed me under his feet.'

921
01:25:01,736 --> 01:25:05,434
'Yes. Yes. I do remember
- He is that scoundrel, Maria!'

922
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:07,735
'Tony!
<i>—</i> Yes. Tony!-

923
01:25:07,842 --> 01:25:11,403
'His shadow has stains.
Blood stains!'

924
01:25:11,512 --> 01:25:12,980
'Blood!'

925
01:25:17,518 --> 01:25:23,423
Maria! Come, Maria.

926
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:30,620
But, how can I come?
I am weak and alone.

927
01:25:32,533 --> 01:25:33,762
And a woman.

928
01:25:35,202 --> 01:25:36,431
Do you remember that you said"

929
01:25:36,537 --> 01:25:38,437
..that you can do everything for me?

930
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:39,768
Yes, I do remember.

931
01:25:39,874 --> 01:25:44,436
Then why this doubt. Have
trust in me and come along.

932
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:54,044
If you deceive me. If
you do not support me then?

933
01:25:54,154 --> 01:25:55,519
How can I dispel your doubts?

934
01:25:55,623 --> 01:25:57,557
Maria, how do I make you
believe that I love you?

935
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,892
I promise that I
will never deceive you.

936
01:26:03,564 --> 01:26:07,194
Do you promise?
- Yes.

937
01:26:16,177 --> 01:26:18,475
Oh God! I vow that the way in..

938
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:22,982
"which I am accepting her
as mine in front of you.

939
01:26:23,584 --> 01:26:26,485
The same way I will
accept her in front..

940
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:28,487
..of the world and be
her partner for life.

941
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:35,495
Till death do us apart.
- Till death do us apart.

942
01:26:41,602 --> 01:26:44,731
Amen.
- Amen.

943
01:26:51,612 --> 01:26:55,845
Let's go.

944
01:27:07,628 --> 01:27:08,754
Tony! Tony!

945
01:29:33,774 --> 01:29:35,299
Sit down, Maria!

946
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:07,263
Maria, come back!
- Tony, stop firing!

947
01:30:07,374 --> 01:30:09,433
Move away, Maria. Go back.

948
01:30:09,543 --> 01:30:11,910
I will not go.
- I am telling you do step forward.

949
01:30:12,813 --> 01:30:14,440
I will come and surely come.

950
01:30:14,548 --> 01:30:16,448
I will shoot you, Maria.

951
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:28,023
You cannot shoot me, Tony. My
love is rooted in your soul.

952
01:30:28,128 --> 01:30:31,223
You love me and care for me.

953
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,733
And you don't kill
them whom you care for.

954
01:30:36,504 --> 01:30:38,268
Stop talking and go back, Maria.

955
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:40,864
If you take a step
forward I will shoot you.

956
01:30:41,842 --> 01:30:46,746
You cannot shoot me.
You love me, Tony.

957
01:30:48,449 --> 01:30:50,474
You will feel restless without me.

958
01:30:51,852 --> 01:30:53,843
You cannot live after killing me.

959
01:30:54,855 --> 01:30:57,415
If you can live then shoot me.

960
01:31:01,862 --> 01:31:05,765
Maria, what do you want?

961
01:31:07,868 --> 01:31:11,827
Throw your gun away and face
the punishment for your crime.

962
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:15,773
You want me to spend my youth,
crying in the jail?

963
01:31:15,876 --> 01:31:17,970
And finally die like a dog.

964
01:31:18,879 --> 01:31:21,780
Before that I will kill all of them.

965
01:31:22,883 --> 01:31:26,786
Tony! Tony! I will
not let this happen.

966
01:31:26,887 --> 01:31:29,788
I love you. I will not
allow you to get ruined.

967
01:31:33,894 --> 01:31:36,795
Are you telling me, Maria? I have"

968
01:31:36,897 --> 01:31:39,298
..spoilt Lisa's life.
I deceived you.

969
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,799
And above all I
left you for wealth"

970
01:31:40,901 --> 01:31:42,801
..alone in the middle of the sea.

971
01:31:44,905 --> 01:31:49,342
Maria, I am so bad that you too can
not save me. I am very bad.

972
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:52,811
Tony, do you
remember you said that"

973
01:31:52,913 --> 01:31:56,144
"whatever is bad today,
will be good tomorrow.

974
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:59,220
But Maria, on whose
hope and by whose support.

975
01:32:03,524 --> 01:32:05,117
He is the only one to give support.

976
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:14,299
Have faith in God and with His
support these sad days will end.

977
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:26,003
Take this. My prayers and the
idol of divinity are with you.

978
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:29,846
You were searching
for the serenity"

979
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:31,850
..of the heart and
peace of mind in the..

980
01:32:31,952 --> 01:32:33,852
"pieces of gold and silver.

981
01:32:33,954 --> 01:32:36,480
If they are there, they are in
the shadow of the idol of divinity.

982
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:53,866
Go, Tony. You have blessed me with"

983
01:32:53,974 --> 01:32:57,877
"happiness by
accepting the path of truth.

984
01:32:57,978 --> 01:33:02,882
I will be waiting for
you here until you return.

985
01:33:06,987 --> 01:33:12,289
'Don't listen to
anyone who speaks evil.'

986
01:33:12,393 --> 01:33:16,887
'Don't act evil if
anyone does evil.'

987
01:33:17,665 --> 01:33:21,624
'Stop the person
treading the wrong path.'

988
01:33:22,002 --> 01:33:26,371
'Forgive the person
who makes a mistake.'
