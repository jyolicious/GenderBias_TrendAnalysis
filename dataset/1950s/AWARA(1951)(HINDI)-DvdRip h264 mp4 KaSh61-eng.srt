1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000


3
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,000
headlines for the front page.
- Oh, drop it!

4
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Here comes Judge Raghunath

5
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,600
Such a gentleman! Why on earth
did that goon want to kill him?

6
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,500
Here comes your friend

7
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
ls the jury in place?

8
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,500
Yes, my Lord. Present

9
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
ls the accused present?
- Present, my Lord

10
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,200
Who is the counsel for the accused?

11
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,100
Who is the counsel for the accused?

12
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,100
Have you no lawyer
to defend your case?

13
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,800
ln that case, the government...

14
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
My Lord

15
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
l'm the counsel for the accused

16
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,900
l do not wish to defend myself

17
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,000
l promised to defend you, if
you're ever arraigned. Remember?

18
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,700
Does the accused give his consent?

19
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes

20
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,600
Raj, you have been accused of
a murderous attack on Judge Raghunath

21
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
You may plead your case

22
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,300
l swear to speak the truth

23
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Judge Raghunath, can you tell us
why the accused tried to kill you?

24
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Did he have any enmity with you?

25
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Yes. The grudge that a born felon
bears against the judge...

26
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,800
who sentences him and
grants no reprieve

27
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,500
Could there be no other reason
for such animosity?

28
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,500
None. How else could l
relate to him?

29
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
l have no further questions

30
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
Defense may proceed with
cross-questioning

31
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
Judge, you are senior to me

32
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,800
lf in the course of questioning,
l happen to affront you...

33
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
do forgive me. Someone's life is
at stake. And you have taught me...

34
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,200
to ignore all relationships for
the dispensation of justice

35
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,900
This is my first interrogation.
Please give me your blessings

36
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,700
What do you mean when you call
the accused a born felon?

37
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,100
He has been a tramp and a hoodlum...

38
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
ever since he was a child.
His record says it

39
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,900
This penchant for crime has surely
been transmitted congenitally

40
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,200
Judge, do you have any children?

41
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,400
No

42
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,400
But how is this question relevant
to this case?

43
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,900
Most relevant. Think again. Are you
certain that you have no children?

44
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,100
No. But l reiterate. This question...
- Can you recount the circumstance...

45
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,400
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

46
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,800
My Lord, am l to be forced to reply
to such meaningless questions?

47
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,800
Ms Rita, you may ask questions
relevant only to the case

48
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,800
We wish to know whether or not,
the accused attempted murder

49
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,700
lf yes, then why?

50
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,800
Enough! Stop it! l'm a murderer!
Hang me if you will!

51
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
Proceed with your questioning

52
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
The accused does not deny having
assaulted Judge Raghunath

53
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,700
But, as you said just now,
the question is why he did it

54
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,800
This interrogation is meant
to reveal the answer...

55
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,700
if you my Lord, and Judge Raghunath
repose your trust in me for a while

56
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,900
You may proceed

57
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,000
l repeat my question.
Can you recount the circumstance...

58
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
when you threw your wife
out of your house?

59
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,900
l beg your pardon, Judge Raghunath,
but this question is very important

60
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,900
And not only for the accused.
For you too

61
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,400
The cause of whatever is happening
today, lies rooted in your past

62
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Remember...?

63
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,100
Can you tell us? Why, when
and under what circumstance...

64
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,700
did you throw your wife
out of your house?

65
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,800
24 years ago...

66
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
l was practising law in Lucknow

67
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,000
l was the black sheep of the family,
because l opposed social norm...

68
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,000
and l had married a widow.
My father was a big gun

69
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
and was away in Bombay most of the
time. He was unhappy with me

70
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,200
But under no circumstance,
was l willing to leave Leela

71
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,700
She was so good to me.
She was such a good woman

72
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
And l was in love with her

73
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:02,900
But once, on our way from
Kanpur to Allahabad...

74
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,700
little did l realise that
like a boat in midstream...

75
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,200
my life too was to be caught
in cross currents

76
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,100
''Cross currents in the midstream''

77
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
'' Beware''

78
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,000
''ln the current you will sink or sail''

79
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,700
'' Beware''

80
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,600
''The open skies''

81
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
''Careful sailor''

82
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,500
''Your boat is headed into a storm''

83
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,900
''Restless flow the deep waters''

84
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
'' Beware''

85
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,900
''Twigs are carried away''

86
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,300
''Steel sinks''

87
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,800
''So what do you think?''

88
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
'' Beware''

89
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,700
Aren't you feeling sleepy?

90
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,400
What are you thinking about?
- Why do they sing '' Beware''?

91
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,200
They say, these parts are dangerous.
Jagga the bandit. He's from these parts

92
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Bandits...?
- Yes, but don't worry

93
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,300
As of now, he must be fast asleep
in some prison

94
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,800
Go to bed. l'm feeling sleepy

95
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,800
ln case you're afraid,l can come over
- No

96
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,800
No! The lady is with them!

97
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,700
Leave me!

98
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,700
You heartless bandits!

99
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
Where's your chief?

100
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,500
What right have you to terrorise
women from good families?

101
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,200
Aren't you ashamed?
- Ashamed?

102
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,300
Shame is for good folks,
not for bandits and robbers

103
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,400
As for me, my grandfather was a bandit,
my father was a bandit! But l wasn't

104
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,600
And your husband went and made me one!
- My husband...?

105
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,200
Who are you?
- Jagga. And l was innocent

106
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,100
But without a shard of evidence,
your husband framed me...

107
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,600
just because my father, my grandfather
were bandits

108
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
He framed me for rape
and he sent me to jail

109
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,100
So l've decided to prove
your husband right

110
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,000
Coward!

111
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,600
See what's wrong with her

112
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,400
Has she come to her senses?

113
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,100
No, she's still in a swoon

114
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Let her go, Chief. She's pregnant.
She's going to become a mother

115
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,900
Touch her, and you go to hell

116
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,100
Pregnant? With a baby?

117
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,900
Her husband said that children born
of good folks turn out good

118
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,600
And children born of bandits...

119
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,100
turn out to be bandits. Always

120
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,200
Now let's see what the lawyer's son
turns out to be

121
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,300
Send her back once she recovers

122
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,100
Good are those born of good folks!
And of bandits are bandits born

123
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,300
You should make me a gift.
- What's the occasion?

124
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Not any occasion.
The lady is back

125
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
What did you say? The lady?

126
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,100
Why is it dark in here?

127
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,300
Lights! Tonight we celebrate!

128
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,900
lt is you who lights up my life

129
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,700
Now that you're back,
even the lights seem so bright!

130
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,600
Give me the wick

131
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,500
But Leela, how did you escape?
l hope you weren't in danger?

132
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,000
Your love was with me.
How could anyone even look up at me?

133
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,100
You are tired. Change.
l'll bring you your dressing grown

134
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
These last four days

135
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,300
The last four days were
like a lifetime

136
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,500
l took the police and l looked
everywhere for you

137
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,600
All the while, l feared...

138
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,500
l feared you were in grave danger!

139
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,800
But how did you escape?
And who was this bandit?

140
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,800
Some Jagga. He said that you
had convicted him

141
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:23,200
So he escaped to get even with me!
lf he has done anything to you...

142
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,300
l'll see to it that he hangs!
- At heart, he's a devil

143
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,400
But God saved me at the last moment.
Thank God!

144
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,400
Tell me something

145
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,600
Ask

146
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,400
Does a bandit's son necessarily
become a bandit?

147
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
Yes, it's bound to happen

148
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,600
But why do you ask?

149
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,800
Just like that

150
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,400
Let's see what comes first.
Your becoming a magistrate, or...

151
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,300
Why? ls someone expected?

152
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
A new guest

153
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Now l don't have any chances
of becoming a magistrate

154
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
Why? What happened?

155
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,900
Whatever... let's talk
of something else

156
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,300
How do you like this?

157
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
Nice

158
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,900
Listen...

159
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Are you annoyed with me?

160
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
Annoyed? No

161
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,700
Why should l be annoyed with you?

162
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,300
Have my lunch sent over

163
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,400
What's the matter?
Where are the servants?

164
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,300
God knows! Maybe they're all dead!
l have to do all the chores

165
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Let me help you.
- You'd rather tell her all this

166
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,400
She's sitting around like a queen!

167
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,100
Not to be cross with Leela.
l told her not to strain herself

168
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,900
You know the condition she is in.
And in a few days from now...

169
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,500
She's going to bear the fruit
of her sins!

170
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,500
What are you saying?!
- What everyone else is saying!

171
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,500
For four days, she lived with a bandit!
And Jagga at that!

172
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,800
Don't you remember what
he was convicted for?

173
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,400
Do you enjoy making someone unhappy?
The jaundiced eye sees all yellow

174
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Do you think you're beyond scrutiny?
Don't you forget...

175
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
women have had to stand the test of
chastity. Because society asks for it

176
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
Bhabhi!
(Sister-in-law)

177
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,500
Forgive me Bhabhi,
your pot is broken

178
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,500
lt's only an earthen pot. But remember,
a woman's honour is far more fragile

179
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,200
Once disgraced, her honour
can never be redeemed

180
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Just answer my question!

181
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,700
Did you not know that your wife
was seeing her lover on the sly?

182
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,700
The villagers used to say that.
But l didn't heed what they said

183
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,900
You haven't yet told the court
why your wife deserted you

184
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
You know it! Women are adulterous!

185
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,800
l know what that means!

186
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,800
Raghu, how can you lose
your cool in court?

187
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,400
l'm afraid your chances of
magistrateship may be clouded

188
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Chances of a magistrateship?
That's out of question now

189
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,200
Can a lawyer whose wife is under
suspicion ever become a magistrate?

190
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,900
The whole town is agog!
- What are you saying?

191
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
about your wife?

192
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,000
l'm just saying what
everyone is saying

193
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
Let them say what they want

194
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:59,500
You're right. That's what l decided.
Let them say what they want

195
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,400
But how do l get rid of the suspicion?
lt's like a leech sucking on...

196
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
some dark corner of my mind!
- What now...?

197
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,700
Where's everyone?

198
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,200
Send Bhabhi over to me

199
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,900
Oh, l'm so afraid!

200
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,400
Why isn't someone coming to me?

201
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,600
That's my husband. Please,
send him over to me

202
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Look Raghu...

203
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,900
l'm telling you again! That baby
isn't going to be born in this house

204
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,200
lf she wants to have her bastard,
let her go elsewhere

205
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,800
l'm not going to let the honour
of my family be tainted

206
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
l'm going to throw this
wanton woman out!

207
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,500
No! l'm not going anywhere!
No one can take me away from here!

208
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,600
He knows that l'm innocent!
He trusts me, he trusts me!

209
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,700
You're here! Now l'm afraid of no one!

210
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,200
Have you heard? They want
to throw me out!

211
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,400
They say l'm a wanton woman!
They say, l've no right to be here!

212
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,600
But now you're here.
No one will dare anymore

213
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,900
Tell them l'm untainted!
Tell them you trust me

214
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,400
Tell them l'm mothering your child

215
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,500
Why are you so quiet?

216
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,500
Have you fallen for what they say?

217
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,000
You're the one who told me...
''l don't care for the baying dogs''

218
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,400
lf you desert me, who else
in this world can l turn to?

219
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,000
Tell me... tell me that you trust me!

220
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,400
''Do you think you're above scrutiny?
Don't you forget...''

221
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,800
''women have had to stand
the test of chastity''

222
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,300
Why are you quiet?
Speak... speak!

223
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,900
You can see the state l'm in.
l'm afraid... afraid!

224
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,700
l'm going to become a mother
... the mother of your child

225
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,000
Have mercy! This is your baby.
This baby is yours!

226
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,700
Get out!
Get out of here!

227
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,600
''The most chaste of women''

228
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,600
''Were banished''

229
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,300
''Why is not the earth rent asunder
in sorrow?''

230
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,500
''Why are not the skies torn apart?''

231
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,600
''So suffers the girl her father
raised lovingly''

232
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
''Her father raised her lovingly;
her husband loved her once''

233
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,200
''Now she goes from door to door''

234
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:08,200
''Oh such games The Lord above plays''

235
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,900
''Oh such games The Lord above plays''

236
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,400
''ln the oyster
He makes the pearl blossom''

237
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,800
''ln murky waters
He makes the lotus bloom''

238
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,300
''Strange are your ways, Lord''

239
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,600
Congratulations, Lawyer!
A son has born to you.

240
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,800
Son of a decent family!
Born in a filthy gutter!

241
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,500
Do you not know what your wife
and your son went through...

242
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,400
after you shut your doors on them?
- No

243
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,300
Nor did you try to find out

244
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,300
But l can tell you

245
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,000
To get out of your way,
your wife left Lucknow

246
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,700
And your innocent son grew up
in a Bombay slum

247
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,700
One day...

248
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,300
Police! Scram!

249
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,300
Hey Nathu...

250
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,900
Hello, Constable

251
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,900
What are you up there like a monkey?
Why don't you go to school?

252
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,100
At school, the master asks for fees

253
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,100
My father hasn't the money
to send me to school

254
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,200
Look at Leela's son, Raj.
He lives in this slum too

255
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,200
His mother is worse off. Yet she
sends her boy to such a big school

256
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,800
What did you say? He isn't a boy.
He's a sissy!

257
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,300
Ma, why do you put oil in my hair?
- Oil keeps the hair soft

258
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,900
But why do boys in the neighbourhood
call me sissy?

259
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,300
So what? How do they
compare with you?

260
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,200
You're a good boy
who goes to school

261
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,400
You'll grow up to become
an educated man

262
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,600
And those wayward boys
will go to jail

263
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,000
Ma, what's wayward?

264
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,200
The ones who just tramp around

265
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,100
Those who think that whatever
belongs to others, belongs to them

266
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Those who gamble and drink
instead of going to school

267
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,400
And they have fun!

268
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,300
Ma, when l grow up,
l'll become wayward too

269
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,100
Nonsense! You'll become a lawyer

270
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,200
Then a magistrate

271
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,900
And then, a judge

272
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,800
You're sitting here?
Everyone's out there buying chocolates

273
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,200
l don't have money

274
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,600
Why, doesn't your mother
give you money?

275
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,300
Daddy gives me a whole Rupee
every day!

276
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,700
You're rich. And l'm poor.

277
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,100
Eat this

278
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,300
No, Ma says never ask
for anything to eat

279
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,800
lf she told you not to ask,
go ahead and snatch it

280
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,900
No!

281
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,700
You're coming to my place
this evening, aren't you?

282
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,600
Why, what's happening?
- My birthday party!

283
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,500
You must come! lt's going to be fun!

284
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,900
You know, Daddy has ordered
such a huge cake!

285
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,900
Let's go and eat ice cream

286
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,800
Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?

287
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,000
l didn't have money to buy anything.
l'll give you some other time

288
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,200
Must you only buy something
to make a gift?

289
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,100
You can give me a flower

290
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Really?

291
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,100
Here you are

292
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,700
Someday, l'm going to make
lots of money

293
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,400
And l'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this

294
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Do that

295
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,400
But can anything be better
than this flower?

296
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,200
Come on Raj, meet my father

297
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,200
Ritu, say hello to the Judge

298
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
Hello, Judge

299
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Bless you

300
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,900
You've grown up in these four years
You must've forgotten me.

301
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,000
Happy birthday

302
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:00,200
l've just arrived from Lucknow.
l owe you a present

303
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,400
As of now, l can give you a flower

304
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Here you are

305
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,100
Let me put it on your hair

306
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,200
Someone has already put a flower
over there

307
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,800
Raj has given me this flower

308
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,100
Daddy, this is Raj.
He's in my class

309
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,000
l see
- Hello

310
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Hello

311
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,800
Hello

312
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,400
God bless you, son

313
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,100
Raj says that he will become a judge
when he grows up

314
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,500
Very good!

315
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,500
Your father must be a real gentleman

316
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,700
What does your father do?

317
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,100
l don't have my father.
l have only my mother

318
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Has he passed away?
- No! Don't say that!

319
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,300
My mother says he is alive.
But...

320
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,500
He doesn't live with you
... and you haven't seen him either?

321
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,500
Your father is a strange man.
- Not a word about my father

322
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,100
Else... else...

323
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,900
How can you let your daughter
play with boys like him?

324
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,000
Go to play, Ritu

325
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,400
Why, what's wrong with the boy?
l like him

326
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,100
He doesn't even know his father's
name, and you like him?

327
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,800
l'd say he's just a wastrel
- Forget it.

328
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,500
Must you hang on to
those rotten old ideas?

329
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,600
What was the Bandit's name?

330
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,800
Yes, Jagga

331
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,600
l remember you saying the same
at his trial

332
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,900
That a bandit's son
always becomes a bandit

333
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,500
l still stand by that principle

334
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,300
Principles, principles and principles!
lt's because of these blind dogmas...

335
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,200
that you lost someone
as precious as Leela

336
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,900
And because of your principles,
you never married again

337
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,700
The dry parched desert that
your life is, is your own doing

338
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
So much so that you would rather
destroy a friendship...

339
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,200
between two innocent children?
Why, what has the poor child done...

340
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,900
to bring you to harm?

341
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,500
Not this boy. But it was...

342
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,600
someone like him who destroyed my life
... and brought me to disgrace

343
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,500
Maybe today, he too says
what this boy just said...

344
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,400
''l'm only my mother's son
... l have no father''

345
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,600
ln every urchin l see him...

346
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,900
the one whom my wife bore,
the one who isn't mine

347
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,900
My wife's, yet not mine

348
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,400
Rita looks good in that photo,
doesn't she?

349
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,900
But Ma, why do you work so hard?
This is why you fall ill

350
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
l'm not going to let you work
anymore, you understand?

351
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,600
You mad boy! lf l don't work,
how are we going to eat?

352
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,000
l'm a man. l'm the one
who is going to work

353
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,700
From tomorrow,
no going to school!

354
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,000
You won't go to school?
Won't you?

355
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,900
How will you become a gentleman,
unless you educate yourself?

356
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,400
Wayward imp!

357
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,500
Without schooling, how can you become
a lawyer, a magistrate, a judge?

358
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,900
lf you say so, l'll go to school
... and l'll work too

359
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,000
But l won't become a judge.
At Rita's l met a judge

360
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,500
l didn't like him

361
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,400
''Are you out for a good time?''

362
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
''Hey Mister, Hey Babu,
Hey Mr White, Mr Black''

363
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
''Out on the streets
we're waiting for you''

364
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,000
''We, the merry boot-polish boys''

365
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,500
Good morning, teacher.
Sorry, l'm late

366
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,000
l work, you know. l work

367
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,600
What's all this?

368
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,200
Brush, wax... l give you a good polish

369
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Your name has been struck
from the rolls

370
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,400
What?
- You can't study here anymore.

371
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,200
But l've brought the fees too! lf you
say so, l'll stop polishing boots

372
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,400
So l can't study here any longer,
can l?

373
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,500
No

374
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:10,600
For a minute, can l talk to Rita?
l have a gift for her

375
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,300
Rita's father has transferred her
out of this school. They have moved

376
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,100
Why did you kick my ball?

377
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,800
Forgive me, l stepped on it
by mistake

378
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,300
How dare a boot-polish-boy?
- Hit him!

379
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,700
You're just a boot-polish boy.
You dare take me on?

380
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,700
Hit him!

381
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,100
His coat... strip him!

382
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,300
Hit him!

383
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,900
My Ma is ill.
Let me go to my Ma

384
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,300
You can hit me some other time.
My Ma is ill. Let me go to my Ma

385
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,700
Your Ma is ill?
- Yes

386
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,300
His Ma is ill!

387
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,100
Run! Uncle Jagga is here! Run!

388
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,400
Get up. Come with me

389
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,600
Where to?

390
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,200
Wherever l go. From now on,
you go wherever l go

391
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,200
That's what your father wanted

392
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,200
You know my father?
- Yes

393
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,700
l knew him

394
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,200
Whatever l am today,
is all thanks to him

395
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,900
l owe your Dad an old debt

396
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Then you'll surely help me
find a job somewhere?

397
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,700
Job? What job?
- Whatever! l'll do anything!

398
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,500
My Ma is sick! We haven't anything
to eat! Give me any job!

399
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,200
l'll clean the dishes, sweep floors,
carry luggage... l'll do anything!

400
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,000
Just give me a job! Give me a job!

401
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,300
You fool! Only fools work

402
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,600
You're a smart boy.
And you talk of working?

403
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,500
Unless l work, how will l eat?
How will l feed my mother?

404
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,600
Steal

405
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,900
Steal?

406
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Stealing... no!

407
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,900
Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!

408
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Pick pockets, locks,
rob, kill

409
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,900
You took so long, son

410
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,700
You've been hungry all day.
Go on, eat food

411
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,900
Food? Have you cooked?
- Yes, why not?

412
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
lt's over there, under the plate

413
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,100
The bread is warm.
l even cooked potatoes

414
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,100
Take some. lt's on the shelf

415
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,300
Have you found it?

416
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,000
Yes Ma, l found it

417
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,500
The bread, and potatoes too

418
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,100
The potatoes are delicious

419
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:01,300
Eat it then. Give me a bread too.
l'm very hungry

420
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,000
Very hungry

421
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,100
Bread...?

422
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,700
Yes, Ma. l'll get it right now

423
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Right now

424
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,100
''Yes, yes, yes!
Steal! Steal! Steal!''

425
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,600
''Pick pockets, locks,
rob, kill''

426
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,400
You thief!

427
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,800
Stealing bread?
- Excuse me, my Ma is hungry

428
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,700
She hasn't had anything to eat
in three days

429
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,400
Son of a gun! Off you go to the cops!

430
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,800
What's your name?
l asked you what's your name

431
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,800
Father's name?

432
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,400
Ma has never told me
my father's name

433
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,600
Where does your mother live?
l asked you where your mother lives

434
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,300
l won't tell you. l won't

435
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,700
lf you don't, who pays for your bail?
You'll go to jail. You know that?

436
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,700
Where are you running?
- Don't send me to jail!

437
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,000
My Ma is hungry.
Don't send me to jail!

438
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,600
Afraid, son? Don't be.
This is just your first step

439
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,100
The road ahead is very long

440
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,200
Hey, are you mad?

441
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,000
Why are you laughing at your bread?

442
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,600
This bread...

443
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,300
you know this bread?
She makes you dance

444
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,300
What do you mean?
- She made me dance!

445
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:56,400
Outside the jail twelve years ago,
had l found her...

446
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,300
would l be here time and again,
for her sake?

447
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,300
You've had enough for free.
Come on, the jailer is calling you

448
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,600
Your time's up. Find yourself
some other hotel

449
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,700
Time up?
- Yes

450
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,200
l don't think l like the food here
anyway. From now on...

451
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,900
it's Hotel Taj Mahal for me

452
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,300
lf you want to eat at
the Taj Mahal Hotel, stop thieving

453
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,700
Stop picking pockets

454
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,200
And do some honest work
- Sure. l'm going on a pilgrimage.

455
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,800
''l'm a tramp''

456
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,400
''Whether l'm rising or falling,
l'm always a star''

457
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,400
''l have no family, no home''

458
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,800
''l have no one who loves me''

459
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:39,300
''l don't have a lover waiting for me
across some river''

460
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,600
''For me the city is empty city
The unknown path is all l love''

461
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,300
''l'm a tramp''

462
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,000
''l'm not rich''

463
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,700
''l'd rather stay a pauper''

464
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,500
'' But the songs l sing
are merry songs''

465
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,400
''My heart is full of wounds''

466
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,700
'' But my eyes are always
full of smiles''

467
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,300
''Oh this world''

468
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:42,000
''ln this world, maybe l'm doomed''

469
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,200
''l'm a tramp''

470
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,900
'' But whether l'm rising or l'm falling,
l'm always a star''

471
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,700
Raj! You had me scared

472
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,000
Come on, give me a hug

473
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,200
Hey, are you talking English?
- This time in jail...

474
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,600
l came across one of the politicos.
l thought l'd make the most of it

475
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,800
And got to talk some English.
l could use it

476
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,600
Tell me, what news of Ma?
You told her, didn't you?

477
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,400
Yes, a long time ago. She thinks
you're away on a long business trip...

478
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,400
with your boss. When you go home,
you must go home in style

479
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,400
l have it all fixed.
- First, tell me...

480
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:28,400
have you been sending money to Ma?
- Of course! On the 1st of every month!

481
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,500
Say, you'd need some money,
wouldn't you? Keep this

482
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,600
Looking for this thing?

483
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,600
l guessed it was for me.
So why not take it for myself?

484
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,800
Want a ten or a twenty? No...?

485
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,500
Bravo, my boy! You'll make
your guru proud someday

486
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,100
And someday, l'll ask your father what
the gentleman's son grows up to be

487
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:18,400
Raj, l've been dying to see you!
This time, it has been a whole year!

488
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,400
Where has this boss of yours
been taking you to?

489
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,500
This time, l've been
to London and more

490
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,100
London?

491
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,100
On my way back, l even stopped
at Arthur Road

492
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,500
My boss is into import and export.
- What's that?

493
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,100
You don't know import-export?
You're so naive

494
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,900
Your son is about to become a big
businessman, and you don't know...

495
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,100
what import-export is?
Listen to this, Ma

496
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:58,500
lmport-export means moving the money
between here and there

497
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,500
But mostly, it comes in this way

498
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,700
How would l know?
You've even started talking English

499
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,900
Sit, l'll get tea for you

500
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,200
What are you looking at?

501
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,900
l'm a thief

502
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,700
A lying thief

503
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,900
l've sinned

504
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,100
Why did you turn that photo over?

505
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,600
Whenever l look at it,
she seems to be staring at me

506
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,200
She brings back childhood memories.
Why don't you admit that?

507
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,500
Where could she be now?
Why don't you try to locate her?

508
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,700
Childhood days, and childhood friends
... do they ever come back, Ma?

509
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,500
l'm going out
- But your tea?

510
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,600
Forget it. l've got to see a friend

511
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,300
My son he is! Silly boy!

512
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,800
''This is a colourful season''

513
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,300
''Men think it's exciting
to see me tonight on the sly''

514
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,400
''Exciting!''

515
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,300
''This youth is so exciting''

516
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,600
''Your girl is mad about you''

517
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,800
''Why do you refuse me?''

518
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,400
''Why do you look away from me?''

519
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,300
''Look here, the world is yours''

520
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,100
''Why are you afraid of love?''

521
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,900
How much did you make today?
- Ten thousand five hundred

522
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,500
Why only fifty-fifty?
You can have many times more

523
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,800
How?
- Tomorrow morning...

524
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,800
a bank is being inaugurated.
Say, how's the opportunity?

525
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,400
A sleight of hand, and there's
a hundred thousand or so going

526
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,800
All you need is a car.
- Car?

527
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,500
A good car.
- For me, that's a sleight of hand

528
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,600
Eleven tomorrow. l'll tell you where

529
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,800
Good! Someday, you'll surely
make me proud

530
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,600
lt's late

531
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,500
You have to make it by eleven

532
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,900
First class car!

533
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,300
Car? Where?

534
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,500
Out there

535
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Who's driving it?
- No idea

536
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,900
A girl just got down
and walked into that shop

537
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,000
Keys?
- With her, maybe

538
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
That one?

539
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:26,900
Can't you see?

540
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,500
No keys here

541
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,100
Return the bag.
- What for?

542
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,300
lt will make things easier.
We'll make it work.

543
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,000
How will you return it?

544
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,000
What happened?
- l've been robbed!

545
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:54,500
Who did it?
- l didn't notice

546
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,500
He was with you!

547
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,200
l had it a moment ago
- You didn't notice who robbed you?

548
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,300
Had l noticed, l would've caught him!

549
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
You...

550
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Yes you!
- Who me?

551
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,300
Look, there goes the thief!
Stop! Thief!

552
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,300
He jumped over the wall!

553
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,600
Wait here

554
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,000
Come on, help me

555
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,300
There you are! Hiding!

556
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Aren't you ashamed? Give it to me.
Else, l'll beat you to pulp

557
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,500
l'm going to kill you! Give me!

558
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,900
You dare stare at me like that?

559
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
Hey... knife!

560
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,600
Are you running away? Coward!

561
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,700
Coward!

562
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,700
He ran away

563
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,900
Anyway, here's your purse

564
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,600
Keep it

565
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
You've been through so much
trouble for my sake

566
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:14,100
No trouble. l've taken more

567
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:20,000
l should apologise. You risked
your life to get my purse back

568
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,400
And l suspected you

569
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,400
Not your fault

570
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,200
lt's just my looks

571
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,700
Sometimes even the police
are mistaken

572
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,400
Bye

573
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,200
How was the show?
- No use

574
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,400
We'll find a car. Why worry?
Get over to the place

575
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,300
l'll join you after a change
of clothes

576
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,200
Hey Romeo! You tear your clothes
no sooner than you see a girl!

577
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,300
Get lost

578
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,100
Get going

579
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,500
Stop! Thief!

580
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,600
Where are you going?

581
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,500
lnside

582
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,200
lnside? What do you want?
- Strange question

583
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,300
Your boss is the one who called me.
And you ask me what l want?

584
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,200
The boss, or the lady? Who called you?

585
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Yes, the lady

586
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,900
So you're the one
who fixes the piano?

587
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,800
Yes! The piano fixer!

588
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,200
ls the piano in there?
- Are pianos kept outside?

589
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,700
No! lnside. Come on in,
else l'll get into trouble

590
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,100
Looks like a billionaire's palace!

591
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,800
The mantle!

592
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,600
What a lovely mantle!

593
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,900
What a grand mansion!

594
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,300
What kind of a joke is this?

595
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,900
Here's the piano

596
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,200
This piano is in bad shape.
Badly damaged

597
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:01,000
Rotten! lt'll take me time to fix it.
Go on, get back to work

598
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,000
l'll fix it

599
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,200
Who's playing my piano?

600
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,900
You...?
- You...!

601
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,700
l'm mistaken, once again

602
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,400
l thought it must be a thief

603
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,700
That's what l am.
- What?

604
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,700
l mean, who else but a thief
would come in uninvited?

605
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,400
No, it's good of you
to have come

606
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,300
You did me a favour.
l should've called you over

607
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:08,900
But l didn't know your address.
How did you find out my address?

608
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,900
No, don't ask me that.
lt's a secret

609
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,900
Let's say, it's luck that has led me
to your doorstep

610
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,700
Please be seated

611
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,100
No, thanks

612
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,800
Matches

613
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:49,200
Madam, he's the piano-fixer...
- Piano fixer?

614
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,700
Your servant thinks l'm here
to fix the piano

615
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,200
But you said...

616
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,800
Never mind, take the call. Go on

617
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,200
Strange fellow. He took you
for a piano mechanic

618
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,000
Not his fault.
lt's just my looks

619
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,200
lnspector sahib, no thief
came in here

620
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,900
Please wait here

621
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,700
What brings the police here?

622
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,600
Excuse me, l'll be back

623
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:25,400
A car thief has sneaked into one
of the houses in this neighbourhood

624
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,000
Have you seen anyone?
- No, no one came in here

625
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,800
She's wrong about
no one coming in here

626
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,300
l happen to be a visitor.
Would you be looking for me?

627
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,300
No... how could this be?

628
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,100
Come

629
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,500
Grand house

630
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,500
Yes. lt belongs to the Judge

631
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,200
Judge...?
- Yes, he's my guardian

632
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,000
Like the guard on the train
... signalling red and green?

633
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:04,800
No. After my father passed away,
l have been his ward

634
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,000
For the sake of my education,
he left Lucknow and he came to Bombay

635
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:10,200
l am much obliged to him

636
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:17,500
Do judges sport such grand houses?
He must be making a pile on the side

637
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,600
What a thing to say!
The judge is very principled

638
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,100
He never spares criminals

639
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,300
l hope God spares him!

640
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:31,700
Not to worry. lf you're ever arraigned
in his court, let me defend your case

641
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,500
You... lawyer?
- Yes

642
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,700
l took you for a schoolgirl

643
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,600
That was a nice one. A couple
of months, and l'll be an advocate

644
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,300
Would you like to see my degree?

645
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:54,400
A judge lives here. And a lawyer too.
Leaves only one to make a full court!

646
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,600
Yours truly. And here l am.
- And what are you up to?

647
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,900
Thievery

648
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,600
Stealing, picking pockets, locks,
ladies' purses, like yours...

649
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,200
that's what l'm up to.
- You're joking again. Be seated

650
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,700
You don't think l'm a thief?
- No, l think you're a gentleman

651
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,700
This is the new world order!
The thieves, the hoodwinkers...

652
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,900
they all dress in first class suits
like l'm wearing, and we take them...

653
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,700
for gentlemen. But those who work hard
for an honest living and dress shabbily

654
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:29,600
... are labelled tramps and wastrels.
The capitalists, the blackmarketeers...

655
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,700
the profiteers, the usurers...
who are they? Thieves, like l am!

656
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,300
You sound like a stock broker
or a banker

657
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,900
You might say that give and take
of money is what l'm concerned with

658
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,400
As far as banks are concerned,
l visit banks regularly

659
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,300
Be seated

660
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,700
Tell me your name

661
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,300
Tell me, whose photo is this?
- Mine

662
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,700
You...?

663
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,200
Yes, when l was young

664
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,600
lt's a birthday photo

665
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,700
Your name?

666
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,900
Rita. Why?

667
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,800
Ms Rita, would you like to come
to my house?

668
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,200
l'd like to show you
something unique

669
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,700
My mother would be very pleased
to meet you. Come

670
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,800
You...?

671
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,400
After twelve years

672
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,800
You've changed!

673
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,000
You haven't changed at all

674
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,800
Where have you been, Raj?

675
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,100
Looking for you

676
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,500
And at last, l've found you
- And when l saw you...

677
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:44,800
l took you for a thief

678
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Not your fault.
lt's in my looks

679
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,700
''Ever since my lover
has come home...''

680
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,300
''my heart leaps with joy''

681
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,900
''His heart said
something to mine''

682
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:13,800
''And the old days returned''

683
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,700
''Our days have returned again''

684
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,200
''He brings so much of happiness...''

685
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,800
''my heart leaps with joy''

686
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,400
''My heart he could win
through my eyes''

687
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,100
''l could lay the stars
at his feet''

688
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:02,400
''My hopes soar...
my heart leaps with joy''

689
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
''Ever since my beloved
has come home...''

690
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,500
''my heart leaps with joy''

691
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,000
''We are young
and we are in love''

692
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:31,000
''He is the one who
makes my world''

693
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:41,100
''My heart leads him to me...
my heart leaps with joy''

694
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:47,400
''Ever since my hero has returned,
my heart springs to life''

695
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000


696
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:47,000
''Ever since my hero has returned,
my heart springs to life''

697
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,000
The Judge is here

698
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,500
So here you are. And you're late

699
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:05,000
The doctor has told you to come home
and rest for at least an hour

700
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,100
But you won't listen.
You look so tired

701
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,700
Just sit here. l'll get you
your dressing gown

702
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,900
Tell me, where have you been
all this time?

703
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,100
l had a lecture in the law college.
l went there directly from the court

704
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,500
All that jabbering
is giving me a headache

705
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,700
That's bound to happen. The doctor
told you to eat before eight

706
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,000
lt's nine thirty now

707
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,200
Listen to that! Even the clock
is angry with you

708
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,100
Come on

709
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,500
Tell me about yourself. What have
you been up to all evening?

710
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:12,500
You look as if you've found
a treasure

711
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,500
You could say that. A long-lost friend
is no less than a treasure

712
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,400
You'll be glad when you meet Raj.
You're certain to like him!

713
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:35,400
Who is this Mr Raj? Where does he live?
What does he do? What's his family name?

714
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,500
He's a childhood friend.
We were in school together

715
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,800
l'm seeing him after twelve years!

716
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,000
After twelve years?

717
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,100
After so many years,
most people change

718
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:53,300
Raj has changed too. At school,
he used to be very quiet

719
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,300
Now he has great sense of humour.
When l asked him what he's up to...

720
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,300
he said he's a thief

721
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,400
Maybe that wasn't a joke?

722
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,000
l don't follow you

723
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,000
Never mind

724
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,000
You know what young men
are like, these days

725
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,300
Who knows, they might steal
something valuable

726
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:53,800
The water is deep.
You might drown

727
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,300
Not without you

728
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,600
ls that so?

729
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,100
Try that

730
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,100
ls that so?

731
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,400
Hey lady, haven't you finished
dressing yet?

732
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,700
Where are you headed?
Gentlemen don't barge in...

733
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,300
when ladies are changing dresses.
Don't you know that?

734
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,700
How would l know?

735
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,400
l'm no gentleman

736
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,500
Savage

737
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,200
l'm not about to give in
to your type

738
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,900
Where are you running away?

739
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,400
Let go of my hand. What kind
of a stupid joke is this?

740
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:13,800
You savage!

741
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,300
Am l...?
- Yes!

742
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,200
You're a savage!
- Savage?

743
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:19,400
l'm a penniless, uneducated tramp!

744
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,800
l don't fit into high society!

745
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,700
How dare l maul your fragile body
with my beastly hands

746
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
l told Ma that childhood friends,
like childhood days are gone...

747
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,800
never to return

748
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,400
Good of you to have told me
my class

749
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,200
lt was a joke. Don't get angry

750
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:41,100
You want to hit me? Go ahead

751
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,000
Whom will l hit?

752
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,200
You...?

753
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,700
Or myself...?

754
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:44,900
Are you happy?

755
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,900
Where are you lost?

756
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,900
Up there

757
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,200
Come back

758
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:56,900
Where to?

759
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,900
Beside me

760
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,300
Why?

761
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
No reason

762
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,300
Aren't you ashamed?

763
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,200
What are you looking at?

764
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:24,900
The Moon?

765
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,500
No

766
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Clouds

767
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,500
What's your problem?
You don't see the Moon...

768
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:37,000
and you see the dark clouds?
Won't you tell me?

769
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,400
Who else can l tell?

770
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,900
We're seeing each other
after twelve years

771
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,200
A lot changes in twelve years.
- The Judge said that too!

772
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:59,100
But l don't agree. Look at us.
We're still friends

773
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:05,400
The Judge is right.
You know nothing about me

774
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,800
Who l am...

775
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,400
my circumstances...

776
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,700
my family background...

777
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,600
what l have been doing...

778
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,400
what l am doing

779
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,200
You know nothing about me

780
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,000
Nor do l want to know

781
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,700
All l know is that you are
the one l...

782
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Rita, you are so nice.
But so naive

783
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,000
And you're such a fool

784
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
A savage

785
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,500
l'm not talking to you

786
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,100
Look

787
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
The clouds?

788
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,700
They are moving away from my Moon

789
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,600
You know, today's my birthday

790
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,700
Which? Tenth? Eleventh?

791
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,200
You don't ask a lady that

792
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,500
All right, l'll whisper it to you

793
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:08,800
Twenty one

794
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,800
No! lt's looking at us

795
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,000
What?
- That!

796
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:41,500
''l wish the Moon would
look away for a while...''

797
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,200
''while l make love to him''

798
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,700
''l'd say a thousand sweet nothings''

799
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,300
''l pray with all my heart..''

800
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,400
''l pray for my love''

801
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:37,900
''The Moon watches me and
my beloved for the first time''

802
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,900
''On our first night together''

803
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:49,100
''Hide behind those clouds,
O Moon...''

804
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,800
''while l make love to him''

805
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:56,400
''While l say a thousand
sweet nothings to him''

806
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:10,600
''l wish the Moon would
look this way for while...''

807
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,300
''l'd make love to her''

808
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,000
''l'd look deep into her eyes''

809
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,400
''l'm a thief;
l steal''

810
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,700
''l have a bad reputation''

811
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:52,200
''l have always stolen hearts;
that's just what l have done''

812
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:03,200
''You must bear witness, O Moon''

813
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:06,900
''While l make love to her''

814
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,400
''When l look into her eyes''

815
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:34,500
''You have stolen my heart;
do not go away''

816
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,900
''Do not forget the path
that leads to me''

817
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:45,300
''Do not trample upon the rose
that is my heart''

818
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:55,500
''Tell him this much, O Moon...''

819
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,900
''l'll make love to him''

820
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,600
''l'll whisper a thousand
sweet nothings to him''

821
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:09,800
''lf only you look this way,
O Moon...''

822
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:17,500
''l'd make love to her;
l'd look deep into her eyes''

823
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:25,300
''lf only you looked away
for a while, O Moon...''

824
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,100
One step more, and the boat
will turn over and sink

825
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,700
Say what...?

826
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,700
Let the boat sink

827
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,700
l don't want it
- But the doctor says...

828
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,400
l should eat by eight

829
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,200
Tonight, it's my turn
to be admonished by the clock

830
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,600
You are angry with me, aren't you?

831
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,300
Today l was...

832
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,400
With Raj?
- Raj is no stranger

833
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,500
He's a childhood friend

834
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,600
l made a promise
to your dying father

835
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,400
To take care of you
as long as l live

836
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,100
You must make a promise

837
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:53,400
lf someone likes you,
if you like someone...

838
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,800
you will not give your consent
without telling me

839
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,400
l know, l am much obliged to you.

840
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,600
But it doesn't mean that you can,
time and again...

841
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,300
Boss...?

842
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,100
Recognise me?
Thank you very much!

843
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,900
You haven't much time nowadays

844
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,900
Well son, are you falling in love?

845
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,600
Or, have you given up your profession
for fear of going to jail?

846
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:59,600
You don't know the size of the scam
l've planned for you

847
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:03,800
She's an heiress.
Just wait for a few days

848
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,600
l'm angling for a diamond necklace.
- Bravo!

849
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,700
l knew it! You aren't the type
to waste your time

850
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,700
But remember!

851
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,100
lf you try to cheat Jagga...

852
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:56,300
''Nor do l want to know. All l know
is that you are the one l...''

853
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,300
Really...?

854
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:05,500
''Remember! lf you try
to cheat Jagga...''

855
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:37,200
''Without you, even Moonlight
is a scorching fire...''

856
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,200
''Come to me''

857
01:38:55,700 --> 01:39:00,500
''Like a flute bereft of melody...''

858
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:06,600
''without you, my life is a misery''

859
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,900
''Come to me''

860
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:11,800
''This is no life...
no, this isn't''

861
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:31,500
''ln the pyre that is my life,
l burn alive''

862
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:36,100
''Like red-hot arrows
tears of anguish rip me apart''

863
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,300
''l want not this hell...''

864
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,600
''l seek only roses,
l seek only love''

865
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:06,900
''A season of Spring, l seek''

866
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:30,600
''My lover has come home''

867
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,200
''My thirsting eyes are sated''

868
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:49,400
''You are the pearl
deep inside my heart''

869
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,600
''You are the light of my eyes''

870
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:08,500
''You are all my childhood fantasies
were about''

871
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,100
''And now you are back''

872
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,300
''Don't break my heart now;
don't go away''

873
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:37,000
''Don't leave me in tears''

874
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:46,300
''l beseech you''

875
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:41,700
Ma!

876
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,300
Help me, Ma!

877
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,300
Ma, l want to be good!

878
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,500
l promise, l won't have anything to do
with Jagga and those others!

879
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:56,500
l'd rather starve than steal.
l will be good

880
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:00,000
People will say l'm honest!
Let's go back to our slum

881
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:04,200
l'll work hard for a living.
l won't steal! Ma, l won't steal!

882
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,200
l want nothing but peace of mind,
and my mother's blessings

883
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:12,800
l won't steal, Ma.
l'll become honest

884
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:04,100
Yes, sir?
- You're fired. We won't need you

885
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,000
We don't employ thieves

886
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,900
May l ask something, sir? You say
you don't want to employ thieves?

887
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:23,000
Would you rather that they keep
thieving all their lives?

888
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,500
Fired?

889
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,000
Come on, the boss is calling you

890
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,400
Raj, what reply do l carry back
to the boss?

891
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,600
This

892
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:58,300
He will either steal
or he will starve

893
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,900
And how long will he not steal?
He has no way out of crime

894
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,100
Let me see how far he goes

895
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,000
Where are you going?

896
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:26,500
To see Rita.
- You can't go in. The Judge's orders

897
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,000
The Judge's orders?

898
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,900
Then go and tell her that
Raj is waiting out here to see her

899
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:46,400
l have much to tell her.
- She can't see anyone. Get going

900
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:56,600
Get going...? Where to?

901
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,600
Come friend

902
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,100
Let me talk to you

903
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:35,500
Strange coincidence, isn't it?
You're a tramp, l'm a tramp too

904
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:41,600
You have no name,
l have no name either

905
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:49,400
You are homeless,
l have no home either

906
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,100
Like me, you too crave for love

907
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:58,400
Difference being only that
you are an animal, and l'm human

908
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:02,600
Human

909
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,500
l have nothing to give you

910
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,700
l can only give love

911
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:31,400
Why don't you watch your step?
Are you blind?

912
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,000
Mind your tongue.
Bloody savage

913
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,100
Savage... am l a savage?

914
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:55,000
Am l a mongrel on the streets?
To be kicked at will or whim?

915
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,400
''Piano-fixer?''

916
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,800
''Your servant thinks
l'm here to fix the piano''

917
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:16,700
''Come to me, l pine for you''

918
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:26,100
''The night is about to pass''

919
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:35,800
''l pine here;
you long there''

920
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,600
''So come...
the night is about to pass''

921
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:58,200
''Even the Moon is waning''

922
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:05,400
''The stars are disappearing''

923
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:21,300
''A painful, restless hour;
the night passes''

924
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:47,500
''Carried away with the Moon...''

925
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:52,800
''l see the bride-like night
disappearing''

926
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:04,200
''Call out to me...
where are you?''

927
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:09,000
''The night is passing''

928
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:35,200
''l fear and l lose hope''

929
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:44,800
''Even my fate is tiring of me''

930
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:49,600
''lf you won't come...''

931
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:52,300
''where do l go?''

932
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:57,000
''The night is about to pass''

933
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,800
The invitations have been printed

934
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:20,200
The day after tomorrow
is your birthday, isn't it?

935
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:24,700
Send them to the friends
you want to invite

936
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,200
All my friends?

937
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:45,800
Yes, all friends. All, who are
worthy of being your friends

938
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:02,800
Your birthday

939
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:12,800
''Raj, aren't you giving me a gift?''

940
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,300
''l didn't have money to buy anything.
l'll give you some other time''

941
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:20,400
''Must you only buy something
to make a gift?''

942
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:23,200
''You can give me a flower''

943
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:26,700
''Someday, l'm going to make
lots of money''

944
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:30,200
''And l'll buy a gift for you.
Something better than all this''

945
01:57:45,100 --> 01:57:49,500
Back? l knew someday,
you'd surely come back

946
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:53,200
For you, this is the only door open

947
01:57:53,900 --> 01:57:58,900
l need a thousand. A loan
l'll return it after l've earned it

948
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Loan? What d'you think l am,
a money-lender?

949
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:11,400
Today is Rita's birthday.
Look, she has invited me

950
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,400
She takes me for a gentleman.
- So you must dress like a gentleman

951
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:21,900
And to prove yourself, you must
also make a gift to the lady

952
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:30,800
So gentlemanliness is for sale,
and you intend buying some?

953
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:36,600
But to become a gentleman, you need
money. One thousand Rupees

954
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:42,600
For that thousand, you have to steal,
rob, or maybe even kill someone for me

955
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:45,700
Do you accept?
- No

956
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:51,300
No! l won't rob!
l won't commit crimes!

957
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,200
What other way out have you?

958
01:58:56,900 --> 01:59:02,000
Once a criminal, you can never
become a gentleman again!

959
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:03,700
No matter how many times
you change your clothes

960
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:09,700
Crime is written all over your face!
You even tried working

961
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Not for you, the bread
in the sweat of thy face

962
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:17,000
For you, the only resort
is thieving, crime

963
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:20,100
Same as mine!

964
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:24,500
All thanks to your father

965
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,000
Watch your step, son

966
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:27,600
l try. But what to do?
Out on the streets...

967
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:32,200
there are those big guns like you.
- Sharp, are you?

968
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,200
Have you seen Rita?

969
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,800
Tell me something
#NAME?

970
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,200
Who are you looking for?

971
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:29,500
Want me to tell you?

972
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,500
Look, over there

973
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,000
So you came

974
02:02:58,100 --> 02:02:59,500
Happy twenty-first

975
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:10,200
Your gift
- Why did you have to do this?

976
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,600
Why did you have to buy
such an expensive necklace?

977
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:20,600
For you, nothing is too expensive.
Besides, l stole it

978
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:25,400
You stole it?
- l stole it from the stars

979
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:29,700
You're such a...
- A savage?

980
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:32,000
What else? You are a savage

981
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,000
You buy this expensive gift...

982
02:03:36,200 --> 02:03:39,800
but you won't spend
for a velvet case

983
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,000
Case?

984
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:46,300
Rita, the Judge is calling you.
Hurry up

985
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,500
What's on your mind?

986
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,700
Let me introduce you to the Judge

987
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:05,200
Come on

988
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:33,300
Rita, l've been waiting for you

989
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:35,800
First, my present

990
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,300
See if you like it

991
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:46,300
Why, don't you like it?

992
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:51,900
Today's a strange day. Someone
gives me a necklace sans a case

993
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:54,300
And someone give me a case
sans the necklace

994
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:28,900
''The man l'm in love with
is full of deceit''

995
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:31,700
'' But l've fallen in love with him?''

996
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:36,600
''Oh, what have l done?''

997
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:02,000
''He looked so innocent''

998
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,900
'' But he turns out to be a crook''

999
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:07,500
''The innocent-looking crook
that he is...''

1000
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:10,200
''he's a blackheart
with a sunny smile''

1001
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:27,000
''l have given him my heart
l'm driving myself crazy''

1002
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:31,800
''Oh, what am l doing?''

1003
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:09,700
''Those blue eyes have deceived me''

1004
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:15,100
''There's an emptiness inside my heart
and tears come to my eyes''

1005
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:24,000
''l trusted him
l promised him my love''

1006
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:28,800
''Oh, what have l done?''

1007
02:07:58,700 --> 02:08:03,400
What have l done?
l've fallen in love with a thief!

1008
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:06,800
And Raju, you...?

1009
02:08:22,300 --> 02:08:24,000
ls it some gift you don't like?

1010
02:08:29,700 --> 02:08:31,700
l'm going to return his gift

1011
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:44,100
Bring him over.
l'd like to meet him

1012
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:09,300
Raj isn't a bad boy.
He has just gone astray

1013
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:15,100
All he needs is someone to love him,
to support him, to bring him around

1014
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:21,600
He respects you. lf you want it,
Raj can be saved

1015
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:26,100
ls Raj not at home?
- No. He went out early in the morning

1016
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:27,700
He isn't back yet

1017
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:59,100
''Falling in love with you, my love''

1018
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:04,400
''l have cried, and l have laughed''

1019
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:20,300
''Happily l have borne
the pangs of love''

1020
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:31,600
''l have cried, and l have laughed''

1021
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:47,000
''What do you know of
the pangs of love?''

1022
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:52,900
''The pain is so acute''

1023
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:16,300
''l'm transfixed''

1024
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,400
''l stood silent''

1025
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:24,200
''l stood in silence, l swear''

1026
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:29,500
''l cried, and l laughed''

1027
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:50,500
''My heart burns, as if on fire''

1028
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:56,400
''My tears flow, as it rains''

1029
02:12:17,300 --> 02:12:20,100
''Like the clouds''

1030
02:12:23,700 --> 02:12:27,700
''Like a cloud, l was a tramp''

1031
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:38,200
''l have cried, and l have laughed''

1032
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:48,800
''Falling in love with you, my love''

1033
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,200
''l have cried, and l have laughed''

1034
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:10,200
There you are

1035
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:13,200
Haven't you brought the police along?

1036
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:15,500
That bitterness is of no use

1037
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:19,500
Your mother has told me everything

1038
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:26,500
So you know l'm wayward
... l've been to jail...

1039
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:32,200
and my name is on the police rolls.
ls that what you've come to tell me?

1040
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:38,000
Try to understand me, Raj.
l still consider you my friend

1041
02:13:39,700 --> 02:13:40,600
Friend?

1042
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:51,100
A lawyer's daughter, a judge's ward
takes a tramp for a friend?

1043
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:55,500
What's your society going to say?
What will your people say?

1044
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:58,800
lf you recant, society
will forgive your past

1045
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,200
Raj, you can make a new life
for yourself... you can!

1046
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:07,900
A new life? On what
will l build a new life?

1047
02:14:08,900 --> 02:14:13,700
Can you give me back my childhood
... the education l never had?

1048
02:14:14,700 --> 02:14:19,600
Everyone says that l have no father
to name... l have no honour!

1049
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:23,500
Can you bring my father back?
Can you give me my name?

1050
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:30,100
Can you give me my honour?
Tell me... tell me Rita!

1051
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:37,500
Rita, l've kept you in the dark.
l've kept myself in the dark

1052
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:43,100
Forget me Rita.
Leave me to myself

1053
02:14:44,200 --> 02:14:46,200
l am not worthy of you

1054
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:48,700
You realise fully well,
yet you want to live in this hell

1055
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:50,800
l never imagined you'd be so weak

1056
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:54,500
Rita, don't you think l never tried
to get out of this hell

1057
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:57,400
But tell me, what do l do?

1058
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:01,200
For twelve years, the world
has chased me towards crime

1059
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,200
Alone, l cannot face it

1060
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
Alone, l cannot

1061
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:11,900
You aren't alone, Raj
Your mother is with you

1062
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:14,900
l'm with you

1063
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:18,900
You? With me? With a criminal?

1064
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:23,100
Yes Raj. With you, forever

1065
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:30,200
Good or not, guilty or not,
whatever you are, you're mine

1066
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,100
This is a matter of the heart. And
the scales of justice cannot judge it

1067
02:15:41,300 --> 02:15:46,200
But this guilt l carry
with me forever...?

1068
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:50,500
For me, as your wife, it will
be the bride's vermillion

1069
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,400
Really?

1070
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:01,000
Come with me
- Where?

1071
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:03,500
The Judge wants to meet you

1072
02:16:05,900 --> 02:16:06,900
The Judge...?

1073
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:34,100
Sit

1074
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:45,200
Name?

1075
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,200
Only Raj?

1076
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:51,000
Yes

1077
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,000
Your father's name?

1078
02:16:57,800 --> 02:16:59,300
l don't know

1079
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
l see

1080
02:17:10,200 --> 02:17:11,500
What do you do?

1081
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:16,600
As of now, unemployed.
Like millions of others

1082
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:20,700
Any other source of income?
Property?

1083
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:26,500
Nothing

1084
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,400
Do you remember polishing boots
when you were a boy?

1085
02:17:32,100 --> 02:17:34,300
l still do

1086
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:36,200
And you want to marry Rita?

1087
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,600
Yes. lf you allow me

1088
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:42,900
And you've been to jail too?
- Rita must've told you that...

1089
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,900
You've recanted...? Have you found
another source of making money?

1090
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:51,700
No
- But there's still hope, isn't it?

1091
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:56,500
lf some silly rich girl marries you...
- Did you call me here to insult me?

1092
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:03,400
We are in love

1093
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:08,100
We want to marry
- All that l've heard

1094
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,300
Love!

1095
02:18:13,300 --> 02:18:14,300
Sit

1096
02:18:16,900 --> 02:18:18,800
And let's talk it over
with a cool head

1097
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:22,100
What do you mean?
- l mean that though l don't know...

1098
02:18:22,300 --> 02:18:28,100
how you managed to seduce a naive girl,
it's clear why you played this trick

1099
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:31,800
l want to know what price
you'll take to let her go

1100
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:46,100
Till today, l thought
l was the worst scoundrel on earth

1101
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:50,800
But you turn out to be
one up on me!

1102
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:54,100
You scum! How dare you use
your filthy colloquy?

1103
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,900
You think l'm going to let
Rita marry a tramp like you?

1104
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:02,800
She'd rather stay a spinster for life.
Better by far that she dies!

1105
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Why not say that you'd rather
she married some rich big-shot?

1106
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:14,100
Or maybe, some judge?

1107
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:16,200
Out of here

1108
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:33,200
Before l leave, l'd like
to ask you a question

1109
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:39,200
What if it was your son in my place?
And because he's poor...

1110
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:43,000
because he was brought up in the slums
and was forced into crime...

1111
02:19:43,300 --> 02:19:50,000
what if it was he who was being denied
his love, his life...?

1112
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:52,200
How would you have felt?

1113
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:11,900
Jagga has called you

1114
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:14,600
There's a big heist

1115
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:16,600
A bank is to be looted

1116
02:20:58,500 --> 02:20:59,800
Open the door!

1117
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,300
Open up
- Who is it?

1118
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:08,300
Open up!

1119
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:22,900
Who are you?

1120
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:26,300
Don't you know me?

1121
02:21:28,300 --> 02:21:29,300
l'm Jagga

1122
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:37,500
The bandit?
- You could say so

1123
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:39,700
What do you want here?

1124
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:41,500
Silence!

1125
02:21:43,500 --> 02:21:46,300
The police are after me.
Where's Raj?

1126
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:51,600
Get out of my house! l will do nothing
to help someone like you!

1127
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:02,900
l had you once, and l let you go
Remember the day?

1128
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:09,300
For twelve years,l cared for your son.
l made his life! For this day?

1129
02:22:09,700 --> 02:22:13,300
Made my son's life?
You forced him into crime

1130
02:22:14,300 --> 02:22:18,000
Get out of my house. l don't want
your cursed shadow upon my son!

1131
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:20,300
Get out! Get out of my house!

1132
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:29,800
Go on! Call the police!

1133
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,700
Let me see who saves you!

1134
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,400
Scream!

1135
02:22:40,300 --> 02:22:42,000
Will you challenge your boss?

1136
02:22:42,900 --> 02:22:45,200
You're no boss. You're Satan!

1137
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:02,400
Let's hear what you have to say now

1138
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:32,500
No! No! Mercy!

1139
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:38,600
No! Enough!

1140
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:14,900
What have you done Raj?

1141
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,500
For my sins, this is atonement!

1142
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:55,300
The accused may be presented

1143
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:04,600
What's the name of the accused?

1144
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,200
Sir, his name is Raj

1145
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:17,000
Father's name?
- Not known, sir. Maybe he has none

1146
02:25:23,500 --> 02:25:28,500
Raj, you have been accused
of killing Jagga

1147
02:25:29,500 --> 02:25:31,400
Do you have anything to say
in your defence?

1148
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:37,300
Have you not appointed a lawyer
to defend yourself?

1149
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:48,800
The case is adjourned. The government
will appoint a counsel for the defence

1150
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:53,900
l know the law. Raj killed
in self-defence. That's no crime

1151
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:58,100
Please save my Raj, somehow

1152
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:01,600
Your deposition is very important.
The whole case hinges on it

1153
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,800
Come to the court tomorrow
- All right

1154
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:49,800
ls she dead?
- She has been hurt on the head

1155
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:58,100
And Raj killed Jagga
to save my life

1156
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:03,600
Please sign here. This deposition
will surely save Raj

1157
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:10,900
lf Raj is saved, l will be able
to die in peace

1158
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:13,000
l should be leaving now

1159
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:29,700
My son!
- What happened to you, Ma?

1160
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:34,800
That heartless judge has killed you!
What is his enmity with us?

1161
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,300
You mustn't blame him, son.
- Why not?

1162
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:39,100
He has always been trying
to make us miserable

1163
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:41,900
No son! He is your father

1164
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:45,400
My father?

1165
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:50,400
What are you saying, Ma?
What has come over you?

1166
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:54,900
l'm not out of my mind, son.
What l'm saying is the truth

1167
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,900
l could not bring myself
to tell you this until now

1168
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:04,200
But if not today, once l'm gone
who else could tell you?

1169
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:09,700
This can't be, Ma!
This can never be!

1170
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:14,700
This is a long story.
But l don't have the time

1171
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:20,300
Keep this. l'm leaving

1172
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,700
He will surely recognise you
when you show him this

1173
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:34,200
He has never forgiven me.
But he will surely forgive his son

1174
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:40,700
l won't seek mercy from the one
who tortured my mother all her life...

1175
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,300
the one who made her beg from door
to door. Ma, l won't have his mercy!

1176
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:57,900
lf l could see him for once before
l died... But why would he come here

1177
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:01,900
Come
- l'm leaving Ma

1178
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:06,500
l'll avenge you, l will
- No!

1179
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:08,900
l'll surely avenge you, l will
- No, son!

1180
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:20,800
The Judge is here to see you

1181
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:26,400
Which Judge?
- The one whose car ran you over

1182
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:38,800
So he has come... before l'm dead

1183
02:29:39,700 --> 02:29:41,800
Alas, l cannot see

1184
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:48,000
Nurse, give him my greetings

1185
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,800
l am ashamed about the accident.
Please forgive me

1186
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:58,000
Forgive you...?

1187
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:54,000
You didn't die! You were killed!

1188
02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:59,700
That heartless judge has killed you!
To make sure that he isn't exposed!

1189
02:32:01,100 --> 02:32:04,900
Have you decided the verdict
about the case?

1190
02:32:09,700 --> 02:32:10,600
Case?

1191
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,500
Raj's case

1192
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:19,200
You are going mad!
What are you doing to yourself?

1193
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,000
You are a mature, educated woman

1194
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:25,800
ln a few days, you'll start
going to court as a lawyer

1195
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:33,600
You might even make a judge.
lf you get emotional over every case...

1196
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:36,000
you will never be able to
dispense justice

1197
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:39,000
This is not a lawsuit.
lt's my life!

1198
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:47,100
Do you not understand as much?
- lrrespective, it won't alter the law

1199
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Nor should you let your emotions
come in the way of justice

1200
02:32:50,200 --> 02:32:53,800
Justice is all l seek.
Raj is completely innocent

1201
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,700
He killed Jagga trying to save
his mother

1202
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,200
You can read his mother's
dying declaration

1203
02:33:00,500 --> 02:33:02,800
ln this particular case,
Raj might merit pardon

1204
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:06,300
But his whole life is a long story
of involvement with crime and sin

1205
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:11,400
l cannot comprehend how you can
sympathise with such a person

1206
02:33:12,900 --> 02:33:15,700
How can you love him?

1207
02:33:16,900 --> 02:33:18,500
You have studied the law

1208
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:30,800
But my heart has not read the laws

1209
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:33,000
Heart...

1210
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,200
and the laws

1211
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,200
The laws...

1212
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:42,000
and the heart

1213
02:33:44,100 --> 02:33:45,800
What a strange concoction

1214
02:33:47,900 --> 02:33:49,600
But you are right

1215
02:33:51,900 --> 02:33:53,500
The heart heeds no laws

1216
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,300
No laws at all

1217
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:00,800
Not even mine

1218
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:21,400
No!
- Get out, Rita

1219
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:26,700
l'm in a murderous rage!
- Have you gone mad?

1220
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:30,100
So you have escaped?
- Yes

1221
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:32,900
To settle the score with you

1222
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:39,900
Then you will be happy to know
that your lawyer...

1223
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:42,400
had just convinced me
about your innocence

1224
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:46,100
l was inclined to let you off
tomorrow

1225
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:48,800
l want no mercy from you

1226
02:34:49,700 --> 02:34:52,300
l don't want your justice,
your law, nothing!

1227
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:54,300
All l want...

1228
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:03,000
Lost your nerve?
You need guts to kill someone

1229
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,700
You should be thanking the one
who has just saved your life

1230
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:12,400
What if l were to use this very knife
to rip your heart out?

1231
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:17,800
Judge Raghunath was compelled to kill
a criminal to save his own life

1232
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,100
What else can the verdict
of the courts be?

1233
02:35:20,900 --> 02:35:27,100
Have you gone out of your mind too?
- l was. For a second

1234
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:33,900
For the scum that he is,
the hangman's noose will be better

1235
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:44,700
This is the story of
Raj's life and crimes

1236
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:49,400
Now you know why and how
he took to crime

1237
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:54,800
My Lord, the one who is guilty
is his father...

1238
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,800
who drove an innocent woman from
his house, and denied his own son

1239
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:02,600
He is the one who forced them
to go begging from door to door

1240
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:05,000
And in the company of criminals,
he went astray

1241
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:08,000
My Lord and members of the Jury...

1242
02:36:08,300 --> 02:36:12,800
if Raj is to be punished for his crime,
then his father should be punished too

1243
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:18,200
My Lord, l would like to say something

1244
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:24,200
Emotion has got the better
of the counsel for defence

1245
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:28,000
ln her anxiety to save the accused,
the counsel has presented...

1246
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:31,700
an interesting story,
however incongruous it might be...

1247
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:37,300
to try and prove that
some criminal happens to be my son!

1248
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:43,600
But l ask, what evidence
does the counsel have?

1249
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:46,800
No evidence on earth will convince you
that Raj is your son...

1250
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,200
not unless you are willing
to accept him as your son

1251
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:54,500
lf there be proof, it lies deep
in your heart and in Raj's eyes

1252
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:59,300
Look at him. The same eyes,
the same high brow

1253
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:02,500
He even speaks like you speak.
He's just as adamant as you are

1254
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:05,900
Are you still not willing
to accept him as your son?

1255
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:08,200
Ms Rita, the law heeds no emotion

1256
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:12,300
Nor my Lord, does the heart
heed any law

1257
02:37:14,200 --> 02:37:15,500
l have no more to say

1258
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:27,900
lf the accused has anything to say
in his defence, he may proceed

1259
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:45,300
Yes. At last, after being branded
a murderer, l hold your attention

1260
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:55,100
Had l been heard earlier, perhaps
l would never have had to stand here

1261
02:37:58,300 --> 02:38:00,900
Ms Rita has tried her best
to save me from being hanged

1262
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:05,300
And not only in this particular case;
in my personal life too

1263
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:12,500
ln my defence, l wish to say nothing.
l am evil

1264
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:15,300
l've been a vagabond ever since
l was a child

1265
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,700
l'm a murderer, a criminal

1266
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:23,000
You may punish me as you please.
But sin, crime, hatred and violence...

1267
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,700
this vicious circle that holds
your society in a vice-grip...

1268
02:38:25,900 --> 02:38:28,800
do you think it can be broken
by hanging me?

1269
02:38:29,400 --> 02:38:31,500
l don't want to tell you
the story of my life

1270
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:38,000
But all l want to say is, l did not
inherit crime from my parents

1271
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:42,200
From that gutter full of filth
that flows beside my shanty...

1272
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:46,500
l picked up crime. That gutter
is still flowing over

1273
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:49,900
And the virus still breeds

1274
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:56,100
And countless children who live
in those slums...

1275
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:58,800
are falling prey to the virus
every day

1276
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:03,700
Do not think of me. Those children
are the ones you must care for

1277
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:07,600
You must care for your children

1278
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:10,700
Lest come the day when...

1279
02:39:11,200 --> 02:39:12,400
yours...

1280
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:14,400
and yours...

1281
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:16,400
and yours...

1282
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:21,000
and your son too stands
in these docks to reiterate...

1283
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,700
that it's an honest father's blood
that flows in my veins

1284
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:28,500
Time was when l was an innocent boy,
just like your sons

1285
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:33,400
Like all mothers, my mother too
wove a golden dream for me

1286
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:39,000
She would say, ''My son will grow up
to become a lawyer''

1287
02:39:40,300 --> 02:39:47,100
''Then he will become a magistrate.
And then, a judge... like his father''

1288
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:50,400
l know the verdict that this court
is about to give

1289
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:56,500
And l'm willing to suffer any sentence.
For my sins, this is atonement

1290
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,500
But l await the decision
from yet another quarter

1291
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:07,200
l want to know Judge Raghunath,
what says your heart?

1292
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:11,400
What says your heart?

1293
02:41:33,500 --> 02:41:35,800
Has the Judge come to see his convict?

1294
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:39,800
A father...

1295
02:41:42,200 --> 02:41:43,300
who is guilty

1296
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:47,000
Guilty? You?

1297
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:49,400
Yes.

1298
02:41:50,700 --> 02:41:53,200
Tomorrow, the law might
pronounce you guilty

1299
02:41:55,600 --> 02:42:00,000
But in the eyes of God,
l am the one who is guilty

1300
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:37,100
Are you weeping?

1301
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:42,200
Yes, for the father who found his son,
and yet he has lost him

1302
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:45,600
For the husband who forced his wife
to become a widow

1303
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,900
For society, where poverty
breeds crime

1304
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:52,800
For the son who is orphaned
though his father is alive

1305
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,900
For the child who goes through life
looking for someone...

1306
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:56,700
who will call him ''Son''

1307
02:42:56,900 --> 02:42:57,800
Son

1308
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:46,300
Raj, son of Judge Raghunath,
you have been proved guilty...

1309
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:49,700
of trying to assassinate
your father, Judge Raghunath

1310
02:43:50,300 --> 02:43:54,400
But in the light of the strange and
unfortunate circumstances your life...

1311
02:43:54,600 --> 02:43:57,500
which your counsel Ms Rita
has presented...

1312
02:43:57,700 --> 02:44:00,900
you are sentenced to only three years
of rigorous imprisonment

1313
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:38,500
Crying?

1314
02:44:39,800 --> 02:44:40,900
You silly girl

1315
02:44:41,800 --> 02:44:43,000
Silly girls never cry

1316
02:44:43,900 --> 02:44:46,200
At this rate, how are you
going to practice?

1317
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:51,900
What use is the practice, Raj?
l wasn't able to save you

1318
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:57,700
No Rita, this penance
is very important for me

1319
02:44:59,500 --> 02:45:01,500
Only after l've been through this,
will l be worthy of you

1320
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:05,900
With you beside me,
l can go through anything

1321
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:11,400
l will become an honest man

1322
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:14,100
Everyone will say l'm a good man

1323
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:17,900
l will read, l will write

1324
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:23,500
And just like Ma used to say,
first l'll become a lawyer...

1325
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:25,500
then a magistrate

1326
02:45:28,700 --> 02:45:30,100
And then, a judge

1327
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:37,700
Last night l saw a judge.
l'll become a judge

1328
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:45,700
You won't call me a savage anymore,
will you?

1329
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,500
l will. You savage!

1330
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:54,600
Time up

1331
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:57,000
Come on

1332
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:12,800
Keep this

1333
02:46:13,900 --> 02:46:15,500
lt's your gift

1334
02:46:17,700 --> 02:46:20,400
Don't worry. l didn't steal it

1335
02:46:21,100 --> 02:46:22,800
l just smuggled it in

1336
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:42,100
Not your fault, Rita.
lt's just the way l look

1337
02:46:50,100 --> 02:46:55,000
Three years isn't too long, Raj.
l'll wait for you

1338
02:46:56,800 --> 02:46:59,100
l'll wait for you!
- Don't cry

1339
02:47:04,700 --> 02:47:09,000
Number 308... move it

1340
02:47:12,600 --> 02:47:14,000
l should be leaving
