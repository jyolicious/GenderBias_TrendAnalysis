00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:48,917
<i>Once upon a time many years ago,</i>

2
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:53,278
<i>there was a prosperous kingdom</i>

3
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:57,078
<i>whose ruler was the brave
Vikramaditya.</i>

4
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:02,838
<i>A terrible drought fell upon
the land.</i>

5
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,958
<i>People were dying of hunger
and thirst.</i>

6
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:10,478
<i>Vikramaditya was deeply upset
by his people's plight.</i>

7
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:15,558
<i>A sorcerer then came to the King
and said:</i>

8
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:23,479
<i>"Vikramaditya, in the Vindhyachal caves,
a body hangs from a banyan tree.</i>

9
00:02:24,038 --> 00:02:27,119
<i>"The great Betaal lives within the tree.</i>

10
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:34,439
<i>"Bring Betaal to me so I shall burn him
and make your kingdom drought free."</i>

11
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,199
<i>Hearing this, the King set off
on his journey.</i>

12
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,000
<i>The journey was long and filled
with treacherous obstacles.</i>

13
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,759
<i>"Beware! Betaal will narrate stories
to you.</i>

14
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,720
<i>"And ask you questions about the story.</i>

15
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,680
<i>"If you stay silent, yet know
the answer,</i>

16
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,920
<i>"your head will explode
into thousand pieces.</i>

17
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,400
<i>"And if you answer correctly,</i>

18
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,361
<i>"Betaal with escape again."</i>

19
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,960
<i>Vikramaditya, there is only
one way out of this dilemma.</i>

20
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,960
<i>Don't get taken in by Betaal's stories.</i>

21
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:47,602
Shall I tell you a story?

22
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,242
Pappu, is this the place?

23
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,202
- Don't be shy.
- Yes, sir. This is it.

24
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:17,403
I've done my job,
now it's over to you.

25
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,083
If they're not there,
you've had it.

26
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:24,603
Don't worry, sir. Believe me,
they're in there.

27
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,203
Pappu, here. Keep this.

28
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,324
- Lie low for a few weeks.
- OK, sir.

29
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,323
Can we trust Pappu?
Do we go in?

30
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:33,203
Who knows how many they are.
Shall we wait for backup?

31
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,684
I hate hanging around.

32
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:41,004
- Is this the time to show up?
- Sorry, sir.

33
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:43,764
We were held up sorting out
the mess at KKC College.

34
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:48,204
- Who's the raw meat?
- He just got posted here. Totally raw!

35
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,204
Sir, my name is Deepak.

36
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,804
- Welcome to UP Police STF, Deepak.
- Thank you, sir.

37
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:55,044
- Married?
- No, sir.

38
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:57,044
- Girlfriend? Boyfriend?
- No, sir.

39
00:04:57,164 --> 00:05:01,085
Prabhakar sir, he has a lonely life, and
you're not taking care of your teammate.

40
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,085
- He won't like our methods.
- Why?

41
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,685
Deepak looks weak.

42
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,445
Had any experience, Deepak?
Or...

43
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,965
No, sir. Never got the chance.

44
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:15,565
You'll get lucky today, Deepak,
if you make it out alive.

45
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:17,645
- Stay at the back.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,725
So, both brothers are late.

47
00:05:23,886 --> 00:05:26,925
Forgive us, sir. We had to deal
with a property loan.

48
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:30,885
Father borrowed money against some land,
we paid it back in full today.

49
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,045
Two worthy sons.

50
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,366
How much did you lose on your bet
this time?

51
00:05:35,486 --> 00:05:37,326
Everything, sir! But I'll win big
on the next cricket match.

52
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:38,526
Wow!

53
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,566
- Informed the local police?
- Done, sir.

54
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,366
Ansari, tuck your belly in.

55
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,966
Or else they'll see your belly
before they see your gun.

56
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,286
Ready?

57
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,647
You first.

58
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:51,688
You'd be dead, Deepak.

59
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,928
Sorry, sir.

60
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:00,369
Prabhakar-ji!

61
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,291
Sir, please...I surrender.

62
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,450
Too late for that.

63
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:51,371
You run out of hiding places,
then you decide to surrender.

64
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:53,330
I wasn't thinking straight, sir.

65
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:54,290
Where is Vedha?

66
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:57,571
I swear. I don't know.

67
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:01,011
- Where is Vedha?
- Don't shoot!

68
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,091
I'll give you whatever you want.

69
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,211
Such as?

70
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:09,051
Money, sir. Just name your price.

71
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,251
Money is so overrated, Muni.

72
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,651
It can change lives,

73
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:17,571
but it can't buy one.

74
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,732
Tell me a joke!

75
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:21,531
Huh?

76
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:23,492
Know any jokes?

77
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:27,732
I remember a joke.

78
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:30,292
Sir, how much is two plus two?

79
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:31,292
Four.

80
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,012
Six.

81
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,932
- How?
- By mistake.

82
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,132
Not funny.

83
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,093
I'll tell you another.

84
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,532
An elephant and an ant...

85
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,253
Don't be a wise guy.

86
00:08:57,373 --> 00:08:59,373
They're new gang members.
Take them to hospital.

87
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:00,493
Yes, sir.

88
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,333
Abbas, why the hell did you stop?

89
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:18,014
Deepak, this is a crime scene,
not the Nimbu Park.

90
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:21,094
- Stop strolling about.
- Sorry, sir. Sorry.

91
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,534
Wasn't that the shooter Muni
upstairs?

92
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:24,814
Yes, sir.

93
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:27,774
He's been charged with
5 murders and 8 assaults.

94
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:29,574
And him?

95
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:32,574
No information on him, sir.

96
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:36,174
He got sifted out,
like chaff from wheat.

97
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:39,855
Sir, he's unarmed.

98
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:41,535
Unarmed?

99
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,295
If the CP finds out,
he'll order an inquiry.

100
00:09:48,335 --> 00:09:52,135
Where are the arms we seized
at the Naka Hindola encounter?

101
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,575
In the jeep. I'll get them.

102
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,175
Who's got 38 bullets?

103
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,695
Sir, I do.

104
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:04,855
Deepak.

105
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:08,056
Now your fingerprints will be
all over the cartridges.

106
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,096
You'll land up in Central Jail.

107
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,896
Learn from Prabhakar.

108
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:21,696
- Who took it last time?
- I did, sir.

109
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:25,656
So, Prabhakar, it's your turn.

110
00:10:25,776 --> 00:10:30,737
If Prabhakar-ji gets hurt, the red-light
district will have to shut down.

111
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,976
In the arm, please.

112
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:36,497
- Deepak, hold his arm.
- Sir.

113
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,617
- No trembling, Deepak.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,336
- Prabhakar.
- Yes.

115
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:42,417
- Ready?
- Yes.

116
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,217
On three. One...

117
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,497
- Why are you screaming?
- Sorry, sir.

118
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,537
Deepak, is he a lefty or a righty?

119
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:55,057
- Don't know, sir.
- Which wrist did he wear his watch on?

120
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,577
Right...no, left, sir.

121
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,817
- Meaning?
- He's right-handed, sir.

122
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,978
This is the story.

123
00:11:07,257 --> 00:11:09,458
We came in following these thugs.

124
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:10,938
He opened fire first.

125
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:13,658
Abbas ducked; the bullet hit
the wall behind him.

126
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,618
He fired again, grazing
Prabhakar's arm.

127
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,058
We returned fire.

128
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:21,578
They ran outside, still shooting.
We chased them.

129
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,458
- Raja Babu got killed in the encounter.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,499
Muni ran in that direction.
We ran after him, he fired at us.

131
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,099
We fired back.

132
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,898
He died at our hands. We had to fire
in self-defence.

133
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:35,659
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

134
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,378
- Any doubts?
- No, sir.

135
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:38,739
Good.

136
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,259
Yeah, I know, sir...

137
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:50,459
The cops arrested
the wrong guy again.

138
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,299
I did a complete background check.

139
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:56,420
He's a college student, sir.
Squeaky clean.

140
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,820
Madam Lawyer, my wife is missing.

141
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,020
What?

142
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,619
No, no, no, of course, I know.

143
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,139
His father came to our office
the other day.

144
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,620
Near Moti Lake, sir,
that'll be safe.

145
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Who?

146
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,740
OK.

147
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,941
Why fear the police, sir?

148
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,502
Will you devour me with
your eyes?

149
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,942
Do you have eyes in the back
of your head?

150
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:56,941
That's why I hate cops.

151
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,262
I hate lawyers too.

152
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:00,782
Am I complaining?

153
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:04,222
Look over there.

154
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:06,302
We moved to Lucknow
6 months ago,

155
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,062
and you still haven't
unpacked.

156
00:13:14,102 --> 00:13:15,182
OK.

157
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,502
Hey!

158
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:35,303
<i>Trading hearts is far from easy</i>

159
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:37,743
- What is it that you do?
- I'm a lawyer.

160
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:42,984
I hate cops.

161
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,263
A whisky on ice.

162
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,504
A large whisky with ice, please.

163
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:53,703
<i>But your magic has cast over me</i>

164
00:13:56,224 --> 00:13:59,224
<i>I surrender my heart to you</i>

165
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,944
<i>O beloved</i>

166
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:07,825
<i>I'm all yours, now it's your call</i>

167
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:12,745
<i>I surrender my heart to you,
O beloved</i>

168
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:18,904
<i>I'm all yours, now it's your call</i>

169
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,146
You do all these things to me.

170
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:40,545
Then give me a gift.

171
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,146
I feel so used.

172
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:48,706
<i>Plucking the stars from the sky</i>

173
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:53,826
<i>I can't promise you that</i>

174
00:14:56,946 --> 00:15:01,467
<i>My love is simple, without frills</i>

175
00:15:03,147 --> 00:15:06,906
<i>I lack the words to explain it</i>

176
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:09,426
Shall we go to bed?

177
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:12,546
Please...let's sleep.

178
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,147
Thank you.

179
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:19,347
<i>I surrender my heart to you,
O beloved</i>

180
00:15:21,747 --> 00:15:25,027
<i>I'm all yours, now it's your call</i>

181
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:30,868
Sohail.

182
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:34,387
Stay calm. It's OK. It's OK.

183
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,908
What! Your son's school fees
are 150,000 rupees!

184
00:15:45,548 --> 00:15:48,268
- Do they inject him with knowledge?
- No, my friend.

185
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:52,548
It's not for the knowledge.
I send him there for the prestige.

186
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:55,428
Many rich kids study there.

187
00:15:55,628 --> 00:16:00,428
Prabhakar, our CP sir's
daughter studies there too.

188
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:01,988
She's my son's classmate.

189
00:16:02,148 --> 00:16:05,588
Is that why you send him
to that school?

190
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:07,709
Want them to marry some day?

191
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:09,109
You'll be invited!

192
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,388
Here he comes.

193
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,989
Why do you look so scared?

194
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:17,069
Imagine your plight if you had
to face Vedha for real.

195
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,549
Vedha?

196
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:21,029
Vedha who?

197
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,070
Vedha Betal.

198
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,670
Mithilesh Tiwari ruled Aminabad.
He was a big shot.

199
00:16:27,109 --> 00:16:30,229
He had 12 armed bodyguards
following him, full-time.

200
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,270
Vedha killed him in a crowded
marketplace. Ask me how.

201
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,470
How?

202
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,750
He jumped from the third floor
with a sword.

203
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,950
And whoosh!

204
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,870
Tiwari was in two pieces.

205
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,470
Imagine how horrified we were
at the post-mortem.

206
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,510
Kidney, liver, all mixed up.

207
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,031
- Hey, Ranjan.
- Sir.

208
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:52,750
- New bike?
- Yes, sir.

209
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,990
155 cc. Liquid-cooled engine.
What's the torque?

210
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,671
Don't know.
But my wife said

211
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,750
when she rides pillion,
we must look the same height.

212
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:02,950
So I bought it.

213
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,550
14.1 n.m. at 8500 RPM.
You don't deserve it, man.

214
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:09,951
- How is your arm?
- Good morning.

215
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,031
Good morning, sir.

216
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:12,831
Good morning, sir.

217
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:17,191
- Deepak-ji.
- Sir.

218
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,031
Why are you in uniform?

219
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:22,112
He doesn't like it here.

220
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,391
He wants a transfer.

221
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,712
I thought as much.

222
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:29,632
My sister Gita's wedding date
has been fixed. You must come.

223
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:30,712
Wonderful, Giri!

224
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,752
- Congrats!
- Thank you, sir.

225
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,192
- Head Constable.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,152
- Where's the IG?
- Outside.

227
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:40,232
Morning, sir.

228
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,952
Vikram, the forensics report
is here.

229
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,632
Ballistic and gunfire residue
are a 100% match.

230
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:48,952
- Good job.
- Thank you, sir.

231
00:17:49,392 --> 00:17:52,113
- Didn't Abbas show up?
- He's taking his son to the hospital.

232
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,073
- Hospital?
- Chronic inflammation.

233
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:56,952
Any news, sir?

234
00:17:57,072 --> 00:18:00,473
According to our sources, Vedha was
at Muni's house for the memorial.

235
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,553
I thought Abbas should
check it out.

236
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,473
- I'll go, sir.
- OK.

237
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:13,313
Sir, they all go silent when I ask
about Vedha.

238
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,033
Sir, I have some info on
Raja and Muni's families.

239
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:21,313
Raja Babu has no family,
but Muni has a son.

240
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,474
Name 18, age Dilip.

241
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:25,834
Sorry, sir.
Name: Dilip. Age: 18.

242
00:18:26,794 --> 00:18:27,793
Where is he?

243
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:28,993
You didn't get the good stuff.

244
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:31,874
- That's why I'm drinking this.
- The cops. Run!

245
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:39,274
Did you kill my father?

246
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:41,834
Come to apologise?

247
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,474
No.

248
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:48,395
He was a criminal.

249
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:51,434
"As you sow, so shall you reap."

250
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,074
Good, the lowlife is dead.

251
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:58,154
He'd get drunk every day
and beat me.

252
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,515
Familiar story.

253
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:08,475
You too?

254
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,315
With a belt.

255
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:14,436
Father skinned me alive for
the smallest mistake.

256
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,115
Ever seen a police belt?

257
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,476
I learned one thing from him.

258
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:22,596
It's either right or wrong.

259
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,516
Nothing in between.

260
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,676
My father had nothing
to teach me.

261
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:32,876
Throw it down!

262
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:35,436
Deepak, put the gun down!

263
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,596
If they hear I faced
my father's killer

264
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,396
and did nothing,

265
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,436
do you know what they'll say?

266
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,596
Let go.

267
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:53,277
Vikram, Sonu's been selected
for the district cricket team.

268
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,637
Want to meet him?

269
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,357
No, sir. Some other time.

270
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:02,717
And Sattu's son?

271
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,757
He's a problem, but he'll reform.

272
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,957
OK, sir. I'll be off.

273
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,877
Sir, was I wrong to draw my gun?

274
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,598
He could've killed you.

275
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:21,798
He's just a kid. How could
he hurt me?

276
00:20:23,318 --> 00:20:26,958
- Mister!
- Coming, sir, two minutes.

277
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:29,998
We're cops.

278
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:32,559
We should know by looking into
someone's eyes

279
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,798
whether he's a criminal or not.

280
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,398
Look at him.

281
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,679
His eyes tell me he's an imposter.

282
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,918
He'll say he couldn't find
the chain sprocket.

283
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,519
I tried very hard, sir.

284
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:47,199
I found everything, sir,
but not the chain sprocket.

285
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:53,039
It's a 1985 model. Hard to find.
Can I replace it with a new housing unit?

286
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:54,399
Only 8000 rupees.

287
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,719
Shall we shoot him now?

288
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,919
Have you heard the engine sound?
Dupu...dupu...

289
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,559
That's the sound I want.

290
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,239
Find that chain sprocket.

291
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,679
OK, sir.

292
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,279
Did you get it, Deepak?

293
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,760
Know why we sleep peacefully
after every encounter?

294
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,640
Because we know we did not
kill an innocent man.

295
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
- You'll learn slowly.
- Sir.

296
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,440
They've been breaking
the law for six months.

297
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,720
22 encounters to their names,
but no sign of Vedha.

298
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,920
Sir, he's the reason Vedha
had to go underground.

299
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,161
We must not forget why this unit
was created.

300
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:37,640
We had no other way
of stopping Vedha.

301
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,601
What's the difference between
cops and gangsters?

302
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,401
- Sir...
- Wait there.

303
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:45,921
Do you believe in police procedure?
Or protocol?

304
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:47,801
Of course, sir.

305
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:50,281
We believe it's better
if two gangsters die,

306
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,241
rather than four cops.

307
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,721
- Vikram!
- We...

308
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,682
I'm in charge of the Shivgadh operation.
I take full responsibility.

309
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,442
Take action against me. Please.

310
00:22:05,562 --> 00:22:07,041
Abbas, I lost my mind.

311
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,921
Let them investigate me.

312
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,442
What's the worst the scumbag can do?

313
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,722
I didn't mean to abuse him, sir.

314
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,922
I meant, sir...

315
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:25,723
All right boys, goodnight.

316
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,722
Sir!

317
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:32,362
I'm OK. I'm OK.

318
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,923
I'm fine. You guys carry on.

319
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:42,643
The place where we were sitting
was in a worse condition.

320
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:47,123
This house belonged
to my ancestors.

321
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,444
It's in ruins now.

322
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:54,923
And the night you hid a snake
in the instructor's room?

323
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,283
When he entered...

324
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:00,604
Remember when we got caught?

325
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:02,723
You took all the blame.

326
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:06,364
Like you did today.

327
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,804
Never mind. Forget that old story.

328
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:12,964
- But those Academy days were...
- The best.

329
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:14,524
- The best.
- The best.

330
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:20,644
Those were the days...

331
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:25,884
Don't start again, please.

332
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:32,244
Vicky, there's blood on my hands,
I've committed many crimes.

333
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:34,045
- I can't remember...
- Hey, hey!

334
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:36,285
We're doing nothing wrong.

335
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:40,285
To clean filth, someone's hands
must get dirty.

336
00:23:41,285 --> 00:23:42,485
If no one does it, we must.

337
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:45,286
Someday we'll have to pay
the price.

338
00:23:46,685 --> 00:23:49,445
Or our families will end up
paying for our sins.

339
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:54,486
The son must pay for
the father's sins.

340
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:57,805
Stop this nonsense, Abbas.

341
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:01,806
You don't understand, Vicky.

342
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:05,886
You can sleep well.

343
00:24:07,966 --> 00:24:09,246
Sameera and I...

344
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:13,526
I can't remember when we last
slept peacefully.

345
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:16,646
We spend every night fearing

346
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:19,566
my son Sohail will have
another attack.

347
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,247
It's all your fault.

348
00:24:35,727 --> 00:24:38,007
I told you a dozen times, don't get me
emotional when we're drinking.

349
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,287
Who kept saying "on the rocks?"

350
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:42,967
According to our sources
Vedha was seen in Mirza Mandi.

351
00:24:43,087 --> 00:24:45,847
This is it, boys.
Close Vedha's file today.

352
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:49,167
Vedha was spotted in this building
in Mirza Mandi.

353
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,608
We'll position the riot control teams
on these three junctions.

354
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:54,488
Yeshwant, Giri, Deepak, Anthony.

355
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:55,968
You monitor these points.

356
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,848
- Make sure no one enters.
- Sir.

357
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,808
- Ansari, cover these three points...
- Yes, sir.

358
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:03,488
Prabhakar, Ranjan and Martin
will be here.

359
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:05,488
Don't let the local police enter,

360
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,168
or our operation will be compromised.

361
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,688
Abbas and I will go into
the building alone.

362
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:11,008
Sir.

363
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,129
Remember, this is Vedha's territory.

364
00:25:13,249 --> 00:25:16,089
There are plenty of people
who'd kill or die for him.

365
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:17,929
Be alert. Be safe.

366
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,048
Yes, sir.

367
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:20,049
Let's go.

368
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:53,172
He's Vedha Betal.

369
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,453
Vedha, we hear you don't like
people talking loudly.

370
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:27,693
I'll speak quietly for your sake.

371
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:32,214
Confess to all your illegal deals
and murders.

372
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,934
We'll try and get you
a minimum sentence.

373
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,334
This offer is valid only for today.

374
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:39,134
So, start talking.

375
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:41,334
Won't you talk?

376
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:44,054
Well, I'll give you three options.

377
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:46,414
A: We pull your nails out with pliers.

378
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:49,374
B: Strip you naked and lie you on ice.

379
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:51,294
Or C: Hang you upside down

380
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:53,734
and tie a bag full of mice
over your face.

381
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:55,534
Talk! What is it?

382
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:58,054
Cat got your tongue?

383
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:03,334
We were interrogating Vedha.
He pushed us aside and tried to escape.

384
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:05,455
We fired in the air to stop him.

385
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:07,774
Unfortunately, we blew
his head off, sir.

386
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:12,815
That's what I'll tell the Commissioner.
Medal guaranteed.

387
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:15,695
He's not talking.

388
00:28:16,015 --> 00:28:17,815
There's one thing though,

389
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,215
he did turn himself in.

390
00:28:22,215 --> 00:28:23,615
He has a jackal's mind.

391
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,376
A criminal mind, sir.

392
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:30,215
And the question isn't
why he surrendered,

393
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,975
the question is...

394
00:28:33,496 --> 00:28:37,296
if he was safe underground,
why did he come out?

395
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:12,337
Shall I tell you a story, sir?

396
00:29:15,497 --> 00:29:17,338
I thought you'd taken
a vow of silence.

397
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:20,818
I learned long ago who to talk to,
when, and how much to say.

398
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:24,738
I learned long ago how to make
people talk when I want them to.

399
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:30,378
I'd like to see this same smile once
you've tasted police hospitality.

400
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:32,458
A guest is like a God.

401
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:35,658
Will you mistreat a guest?

402
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:40,178
Why surrender?

403
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,658
I came to tell you a story, sir.

404
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:47,018
Your story is all too familiar.

405
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:51,098
"I come from a poor family.
They all depended on me.

406
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:52,819
"It started with pickpocketing.

407
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:56,459
"Then circumstances forced me
to become who I am."

408
00:29:57,098 --> 00:29:59,059
Your story, right?

409
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:02,179
Shall I tell you more?

410
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:05,099
If I offered you 100 million rupees

411
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:09,179
and said: "Vedha, take it.
Turn your back on crime."

412
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:11,739
You'd refuse me point blank
and go home.

413
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,979
Then you'd start plotting how
to rob that 100 million from me.

414
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,060
That's your nature.

415
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,980
If I offered you this same 100 million
and asked you to let me go,

416
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,580
you would not.

417
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,580
You'd kill me the first chance
you got.

418
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,620
That's your nature.

419
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,100
Nice.

420
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,780
You and I are so alike, sir.

421
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,980
We only exist because of each other.

422
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,021
They both might have tails,

423
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,100
but does that make a cat
and a mouse alike?

424
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,260
A cat exists because
the mouse exists, sir.

425
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,540
But the mouse has walked
into a trap.

426
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,140
Would the mouse do so willingly?

427
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,261
This is no ordinary mouse.

428
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:56,701
He's committed 16 murders.

429
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,581
You're no ordinary cat. You have
15 encounters to your name.

430
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:01,781
18.

431
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,741
Were you behind the
Shivgadh encounter?

432
00:31:09,182 --> 00:31:10,661
That was Abbas Ali.

433
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:13,382
Oh, yes? The encounter ended with
three dead men?

434
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:15,581
They fired first.

435
00:31:16,222 --> 00:31:18,142
We fired back in self-defence.

436
00:31:20,702 --> 00:31:21,941
No choice.

437
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,862
I've killed 16,
you've killed 18.

438
00:31:26,182 --> 00:31:28,422
- You're ahead of me, sir.
- No.

439
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:31,342
The question isn't about
who's ahead,

440
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,823
it's about right and wrong.

441
00:31:33,022 --> 00:31:36,262
This side of the line is right,
the other is wrong.

442
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:38,502
I believe you, sir.

443
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:41,382
You're Ram and I'm Raavan.

444
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,863
You forget Lord Ram played a vital role
in making Raavan who he was.

445
00:31:48,543 --> 00:31:50,063
You're wondering

446
00:31:50,903 --> 00:31:53,383
if Vedha was safe underground,
why did he come out?

447
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,223
To tell you a story.

448
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,903
It's important you hear it.

449
00:32:07,823 --> 00:32:09,544
Thief! Thief!

450
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:13,984
Bye.

451
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:24,104
Is that Parihar's son?

452
00:32:24,304 --> 00:32:26,024
The PWD contractor?

453
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,384
Who took him?

454
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,025
He was kidnapped from my territory.

455
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:33,824
They want 10 million in ransom.

456
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,184
Find out who they are.

457
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:38,545
Boss.

458
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:43,625
Boss, I think they're outsiders.

459
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,905
No one in Kanpur would dare
cross you.

460
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:48,385
Your reputation is at stake.

461
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:51,505
If news gets out

462
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:55,665
that an outsider abducted a kid
in Parshuram's territory,

463
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,386
then it's all over for you.

464
00:32:58,585 --> 00:32:59,665
Get my spittoon.

465
00:33:08,306 --> 00:33:11,145
Boss, may I say something?

466
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:13,346
Put it over there.

467
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:19,586
- Boss, I think...
- Go!

468
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,746
- Who is he?
- He's new.

469
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:32,506
If he interrupts you again,
I'll give him a hard slap.

470
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,907
They abducted the kid
from under our noses.

471
00:33:43,027 --> 00:33:45,187
Everyone was stunned.

472
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:47,467
Why be a hero?

473
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:48,867
Why poke your nose in?

474
00:33:49,187 --> 00:33:50,948
Don't push it.

475
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,747
We're foot soldiers.
This is our life.

476
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,628
Why fight destiny?

477
00:33:55,748 --> 00:33:59,108
You think destiny will help you
if you fight it?

478
00:33:59,588 --> 00:34:01,708
Destiny can be made.

479
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:04,907
- Wow!
- Such pearls of wisdom.

480
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,307
Greetings, uncle.

481
00:34:10,108 --> 00:34:11,948
One man less.

482
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,828
- Ask who.
- Who?

483
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:15,588
My father.

484
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:19,389
He spent his whole life
sitting around.

485
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,868
You talk as if he ended up
living in France.

486
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:25,989
If he had only tried a little,
he would've been successful.

487
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:28,709
You're so right.

488
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:34,908
Where would they hide
a kidnapped kid?

489
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,829
Get it?

490
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,910
- The Ganga stretches for miles here.
- So?

491
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,470
Who knows?

492
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,230
How will you find the kid here?
It's vast.

493
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,030
To fly you need to see the sky,

494
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,629
not the land.

495
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,829
Look over there.

496
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:06,990
An eagle can see both
the hunter and the hunted.

497
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,231
That's the Ghansa gang.

498
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,231
You thought it was your old aunt?

499
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:25,871
- Uncle, listen to me.
- Quiet.

500
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,070
Let's plan.

501
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,191
No plan, let's attack.

502
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,551
No. I get out of breath very easily.

503
00:35:35,671 --> 00:35:36,831
Why did you come?

504
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:45,711
<i>Sacrifice your life for a smile</i>

505
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,432
<i>Share the pain of others</i>

506
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:55,551
<i>Love someone from the bottom
of your heart</i>

507
00:35:55,911 --> 00:35:57,272
What a song!

508
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,552
When I was a kid, it was
my favourite song.

509
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:01,992
- It's a Raj Kapoor song.
- Who are you?

510
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:04,792
- Anwar, my gun.
- What are you doing?

511
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,232
What, man? I came for some action.
You can see my knife.

512
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:08,992
But let me hear the song first.

513
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:10,153
Hey.

514
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:13,352
Cool it! What's the hurry?
We can start later.

515
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:16,993
Oh man!

516
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:29,193
<i>Sacrifice your life for a smile</i>

517
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:33,393
<i>Share the pain of others</i>

518
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:37,634
<i>Love someone from the bottom
of your heart</i>

519
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:42,033
<i>That's what life is all about</i>

520
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,074
<i>I admit my pocket is like
a pauper's</i>

521
00:37:18,354 --> 00:37:21,075
<i>Yet my heart is like
a rich man's</i>

522
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:25,395
Your choice of music is cool,
but you're a moron.

523
00:37:26,355 --> 00:37:27,955
This is Parshuram's territory.

524
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:29,995
Nothing personal.

525
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:32,075
But I'm on his side.

526
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:55,396
How can I thank you?

527
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:57,236
No need.

528
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:02,516
Consider it Parshuram's gift.

529
00:38:21,477 --> 00:38:22,957
Your efforts,

530
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:25,037
and I get the credit.

531
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:28,158
To whom do I owe the favour?

532
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:31,077
Speak!

533
00:38:31,797 --> 00:38:33,678
I've been trying to, sir.

534
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,117
But you didn't let me.

535
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,077
What did you want to say?

536
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,358
Kanpur's getting crowded, sir.

537
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:47,918
Lucknow is calling.

538
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,118
But you turned a deaf ear.

539
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,279
From now on,

540
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,039
Vedha will look after
the contracting business.

541
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,039
Boss, I won't spare Vedha.

542
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:17,199
That scum doesn't know he's
stuck his hand in a beehive.

543
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:18,799
I'll bury him alive.

544
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:22,280
It's not as easy as you think, Ravi.
Parshuram's protecting him.

545
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:26,240
Stay calm and focus
on our heroin business.

546
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,279
Everyone's here. Great!

547
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,239
Children, listen carefully.
I'll say it again.

548
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,520
It's all about keeping eyes
and ears open.

549
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,920
Tell me. How can you tell
if it's the police?

550
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,720
Their sirens.

551
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,920
Their shoes and truncheons.

552
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,120
Their uniforms.

553
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,480
Bravo!

554
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,400
Remember what I told you.

555
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,201
They don't always wear uniforms.

556
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:53,241
They dress casually, too.

557
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:55,000
Then how will you recognise them?

558
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:56,320
Their short haircuts.

559
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,001
Bravo, son.

560
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,281
Short haircuts, chiselled moustaches,

561
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:02,961
and super clean shaven.

562
00:40:03,921 --> 00:40:05,040
- Understand?
- Yes.

563
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,361
Yes.

564
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,361
- What's your name?
- Shatak.

565
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:12,081
Mr. Shatak, in case you
get caught with heroin,

566
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:13,441
what will you tell the police?

567
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,521
I found it lying on the road.

568
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:19,282
Bravo! You know your lines.
You've earned a round of applause.

569
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:20,921
Bravo!

570
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:23,081
Bablu gang is ready now.

571
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:25,282
Bravo. Well done!

572
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:30,402
Shatak, what are you doing here?

573
00:40:30,642 --> 00:40:32,362
Bablu called me.

574
00:40:35,522 --> 00:40:36,802
He calls and you come.

575
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:40,082
Chanda, you're older.

576
00:40:40,602 --> 00:40:42,162
Why are you so stupid?

577
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,162
Now go.

578
00:40:44,243 --> 00:40:46,362
Where are you taking them?

579
00:40:48,443 --> 00:40:51,563
Bablu, he's my kid brother.

580
00:40:52,442 --> 00:40:55,682
No wonder he's so sharp.

581
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,643
He'll outsmart you, Vedha.

582
00:40:57,763 --> 00:41:00,563
I'll hit you with a pan,
you'll end up in Japan.

583
00:41:04,403 --> 00:41:05,763
Don't taunt me.

584
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:07,283
Tell Shiv Prasad.

585
00:41:07,803 --> 00:41:09,923
He told me to put the kids to work.

586
00:41:10,163 --> 00:41:13,764
You said if the police arrest us kids,
they won't harm us.

587
00:41:14,124 --> 00:41:16,083
- You have a sharp tongue.
- Yes, and so?

588
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:17,883
- I'll show you...
- Bablu!

589
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:20,924
Does it look good getting
beaten up by a girl?

590
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,163
Watch your step, Vedha.

591
00:41:23,444 --> 00:41:28,524
Shiv Prasad is very close
to Parshuram. And if we start...

592
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:30,244
Oh man!

593
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:34,124
My hands are shaking from fear.

594
00:41:34,884 --> 00:41:35,764
Idiot.

595
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:40,124
Shut up!

596
00:41:47,644 --> 00:41:48,925
Why do you keep watching
<i>Shaktiman</i>?

597
00:41:49,165 --> 00:41:50,764
He's a great guy.

598
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,165
How so?

599
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,364
He's a hero.

600
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:55,845
What's a hero?

601
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,485
Someone who helps the weak.

602
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:01,045
Someone who helps the weak?
I see.

603
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:03,285
Is that easy?

604
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:05,445
No, it's tough.

605
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:07,845
I see.

606
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:09,725
Who are you?

607
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,885
What do they call you at school?

608
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:14,525
- Shatak.
- How come?

609
00:42:15,286 --> 00:42:17,966
I scored 100 marks in maths.
A century, that's why.

610
00:42:18,086 --> 00:42:20,165
Was it easy?

611
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:22,126
No. It was hard work.

612
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:23,686
Why do you work so hard?

613
00:42:24,286 --> 00:42:25,446
To become a hero.

614
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:28,046
Someone who helps the weak?
Like Shaktiman?

615
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,166
Yes.

616
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:30,846
I see.

617
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,687
Someone wants to be like Shaktiman.

618
00:42:40,006 --> 00:42:42,567
But he's wasting time
with worthless people.

619
00:42:49,686 --> 00:42:52,887
Why beat around the bush?
Come to the point.

620
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:55,287
Don't waste my time.

621
00:43:06,928 --> 00:43:09,167
I'm going to Lucknow
for three days.

622
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:11,208
What will my hero do?

623
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,128
Study and stay away
from worthless people.

624
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:29,168
Come, my hero! Great.

625
00:43:30,128 --> 00:43:34,409
Bablu's gang! The packets must be
the same size. Got it?

626
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:53,809
What will you say if
the police catch you?

627
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:55,609
We found it lying on the road.

628
00:43:55,729 --> 00:43:58,569
Not a word more. No matter
what they ask.

629
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:01,809
Now run. Quickly. Run!

630
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,130
There's only one packet left.

631
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:14,370
It'll get you arrested.
Get rid of it.

632
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,050
Shaktiman smashed all the thugs
yesterday.

633
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:20,090
- Shatak, take this.
- No.

634
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:24,050
- Give it to Chajju the confectioner.
- Don't want it.

635
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:26,570
- I'll give you 100 rupees.
- 100 rupees?

636
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:28,490
Chanda, stay out of it.

637
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,291
You and your brother...go!

638
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:32,811
Chanda, what are you doing?

639
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:36,331
If my brother finds out,
we'll both get whacked.

640
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:37,450
Nothing will happen, Shatak.

641
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,691
The police!

642
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,891
Run, Chanda, run!

643
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:55,851
No, no. This way.

644
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:05,531
Come on, Chanda.

645
00:45:09,612 --> 00:45:13,132
Search me! Strip me. Want me
to take off my underwear too?

646
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:15,332
Madam, he's clean.

647
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:17,972
I told you; I've mended my ways.
Can I go?

648
00:45:18,852 --> 00:45:21,573
Madam, I found this packet
in her bag.

649
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:24,972
Why are you looking at me?
She's the one with the bag.

650
00:45:25,212 --> 00:45:26,652
Who gave it to you?

651
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:28,773
No one. I found it lying
on the road.

652
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:31,493
Why are you hitting her?
Bablu gave it to her.

653
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,173
He said: "Dodge the police,
I'll give you 100 rupees."

654
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:35,973
Look at this.

655
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,493
- Why are you lying?
- We're not lying.

656
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:38,693
Madam, he's lying...

657
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,093
We lost 50,000.

658
00:45:44,013 --> 00:45:45,453
And the business was shut down.

659
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:49,093
- What was the boy's name?
- Shatak, boss.

660
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:51,214
We thrive on fear, Bablu.

661
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:53,974
This boy will set a bad example
for the other kids.

662
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:55,774
He's Vedha's brother.

663
00:45:56,533 --> 00:45:58,054
So what?

664
00:45:58,374 --> 00:45:59,694
Scar him.

665
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:05,934
<i>Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall.</i>

666
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,334
Shatak, run.

667
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:08,454
Where do you think you're going?

668
00:46:08,574 --> 00:46:09,694
- Come on.
- Let go!

669
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:10,974
Where are you taking him?
Let go.

670
00:46:12,454 --> 00:46:14,294
- I'll tell Vedha.
- Get lost!

671
00:46:15,054 --> 00:46:16,574
He's just a child.

672
00:46:17,094 --> 00:46:18,695
Let me go.

673
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:29,495
It's nothing, brother.

674
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:32,495
It won't affect my studies.

675
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:34,615
I'll be more careful next time.

676
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:37,575
It won't happen again.

677
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,375
No, it won't.

678
00:46:46,575 --> 00:46:47,775
Never again.

679
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:40,217
Now tell me, sir.

680
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:44,217
Who will Vedha punish?

681
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:48,737
Bablu who stabbed his brother's hand?

682
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:52,097
Or Shiv Prasad whose orders
he followed?

683
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:53,978
Bravo.

684
00:47:55,658 --> 00:47:58,698
You save a child, but you shoot a guy
in the back,

685
00:47:58,818 --> 00:48:01,658
and become a don overnight,
Vedha Betal.

686
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:06,058
When your days are numbered,
you start talking in riddles.

687
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:09,138
Do you believe you're the hero
of your story?

688
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:11,619
The question isn't about me, sir.

689
00:48:12,178 --> 00:48:13,859
The question is about the moral dilemma
I'm facing.

690
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,459
Moral dilemma?

691
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:19,379
It's easy to choose
between good and evil, sir.

692
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:24,579
But in this story,
they're both evil.

693
00:48:25,899 --> 00:48:27,619
That's the dilemma.

694
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:31,900
Who will you punish?

695
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,659
The guy who did it?
Or the one who instigated it?

696
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:38,099
Don't hold back. Punish the evil.

697
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,499
Kill them both.

698
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:42,379
I didn't expect that from you, sir.

699
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:44,659
You know rules of punishment?

700
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,300
One crime, one punishment.

701
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,780
Right.

702
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,940
One crime, one punishment.

703
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,140
If I punish the doer,
then the instigator escapes.

704
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,300
And if I punish the instigator,

705
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,781
then the doer escapes.

706
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:05,820
Who would you punish, sir?
Shiv Prasad or Bablu?

707
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,301
Shiv Prasad ordered the attack,
Bablu committed the crime.

708
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,221
Bablu is just the trigger,

709
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:22,781
Shiv Prasad's finger was on
the trigger.

710
00:49:23,221 --> 00:49:24,661
The finger is to blame.

711
00:49:25,621 --> 00:49:27,222
Shiv Prasad should be punished.

712
00:49:42,942 --> 00:49:46,702
Did you act out of love
for your brother?

713
00:49:48,062 --> 00:49:50,182
Or to rule the world of crime?

714
00:49:55,382 --> 00:49:57,583
- What was it?
- Someone to see you, sir.

715
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:01,063
Priya?

716
00:50:02,902 --> 00:50:06,543
Mr. Vedha is our client.
He's our senior lawyer.

717
00:50:06,862 --> 00:50:09,063
And this is Mr. Vedha's bail order.

718
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:28,784
If you were in a hurry to get bail,
then why surrender?

719
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:31,064
Check the bail orders.
Is everything OK?

720
00:50:31,223 --> 00:50:32,024
Damn...

721
00:50:32,144 --> 00:50:35,264
Sir, you'd better talk
to my lawyer. He's outside.

722
00:50:36,464 --> 00:50:38,783
Vedha, did they mistreat you?

723
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:40,264
No, Bablu.

724
00:50:41,464 --> 00:50:44,424
In fact, we've become friends.

725
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:46,744
I'm leaving, sir.

726
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:49,785
What's your game?

727
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:53,184
You have to figure that out, sir.

728
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:58,625
Bablu, let's go.

729
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:09,665
How could I know it was
your case?

730
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:12,305
You never tell me anything.

731
00:51:13,305 --> 00:51:14,505
Now you know.

732
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,345
He's using you to escape the law.

733
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:18,226
You're overreacting, Vikram.

734
00:51:18,346 --> 00:51:19,786
Mr. Vedha is our client.

735
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:22,145
Mister? Bloody imposter criminal.

736
00:51:22,385 --> 00:51:24,385
Imposter criminal,
but he has rights too.

737
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:27,865
Come on, this is my biggest case.

738
00:51:28,426 --> 00:51:31,746
And Vedha turned himself in,
didn't he ?

739
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:39,106
You talk as if you'd risked your life
arresting him,

740
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,306
and I freed him.

741
00:51:40,426 --> 00:51:40,986
Priya!

742
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,266
Sh***

743
00:51:46,626 --> 00:51:47,906
It's OK. I'm fine.

744
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:49,226
I'm fine.

745
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:57,626
Think about it, Priya.

746
00:51:58,507 --> 00:52:00,907
How can we work on the same case,
living under the same roof?

747
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,587
What about our private life?

748
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:07,787
We'll have to go to different rooms
to take calls.

749
00:52:09,107 --> 00:52:12,067
Husband and wife working on the same
case is a conflict of interest.

750
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,868
My department will never approve,
nor will the court.

751
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:27,068
You're right. So what shall we do?

752
00:52:28,107 --> 00:52:30,268
- Drop the case.
- You quit your job.

753
00:52:30,868 --> 00:52:32,988
Your job is real. My job is a waste
of time?

754
00:52:33,388 --> 00:52:35,508
He's been accused of 16 murders.

755
00:52:36,068 --> 00:52:39,188
A special police task force has been
chasing Mr. Vedha

756
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:41,509
and his gang for six months,

757
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,468
and you had him released
in six minutes.

758
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:47,228
Are you doing something noble
by defending this criminal?

759
00:52:47,348 --> 00:52:50,869
No, your department is, in the name
of law and order...those encounters.

760
00:52:57,669 --> 00:53:00,069
Priya must know there's a
difference between us and them.

761
00:53:00,189 --> 00:53:01,749
Why marry me to a lawyer?

762
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,509
Can I call you back? I'm driving.

763
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:04,869
All OK?

764
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:07,629
I'm going to the Old Mill.
Got a tip off.

765
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:10,029
Some Chanda says she has info
about a drug deal.

766
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:10,829
Shall I come?

767
00:53:10,949 --> 00:53:12,110
<i>No, I'll handle it.</i>

768
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:34,990
Let me go.

769
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:08,752
Shatak?

770
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:13,951
What's wrong?

771
00:54:15,472 --> 00:54:17,431
<i>I'm going to the Old Mill.
Got a tip off.</i>

772
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,952
Some Chanda says she has info
about a drug deal.

773
00:54:20,352 --> 00:54:22,592
Chanda, you're older now.

774
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:25,832
Vikram?

775
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:32,232
Who will you punish?

776
00:54:33,113 --> 00:54:35,952
The doer, or the instigator?

777
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,113
- It was Abbas Ali's operation...
- Really?

778
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:48,673
Vedha's brother Shatak died
in the Shivgadh operation.

779
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,993
Vedha resurfaced to get revenge.

780
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:53,233
But he wants the finger,
not the trigger.

781
00:54:53,353 --> 00:54:55,353
I took Abbas's name by accident.

782
00:55:13,314 --> 00:55:14,234
Abbas.

783
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:20,154
Abbas!

784
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:45,595
Abbas!

785
00:56:28,516 --> 00:56:30,276
Did you inform Abbas's family?

786
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:33,756
Sir.

787
00:56:35,637 --> 00:56:36,837
I'll do it.

788
00:56:47,398 --> 00:56:48,557
Vikram.

789
00:56:58,518 --> 00:57:03,157
<i>You leaving without uttering
a word</i>

790
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:14,718
<i>O friend, why turn your back on me?</i>

791
00:57:21,878 --> 00:57:27,278
<i>You stood by me in all my loneliness</i>

792
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:38,039
<i>So much is left unheard</i>

793
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:44,119
<i>So much is left unspoken</i>

794
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:49,959
<i>Come back. Make your way back to me</i>

795
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,279
<i>O friend, is this the way to depart?</i>

796
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,640
The night SSP Abbas Ali
was murdered,

797
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,801
Mr. Vedha was attending
a wedding in Agra.

798
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:21,241
His travel and hotel details.

799
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:23,800
Here are the photos and the footage
confirming his alibi.

800
00:58:24,481 --> 00:58:26,241
Priya, Abbas was murdered.

801
00:58:27,201 --> 00:58:28,361
Our Abbas.

802
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:30,321
Where's your conscience?

803
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:34,481
I'll see you in court, sir.
Thank you for your time.

804
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:35,161
OK.

805
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,682
Sir, Vedha killed Abbas.

806
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:40,161
I hope you don't have
any doubts about that.

807
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:44,921
The bullets retrieved from Abbas's body
were fired from Chanda's gun.

808
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,602
- But sir...
- Don't jump to conclusions, Vikram.

809
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:50,842
CB CID is handling the case.

810
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:52,802
They'll deal with it.

811
00:58:57,402 --> 00:59:00,202
If anyone interferes in Abbas's case,

812
00:59:00,562 --> 00:59:02,402
our unit will be suspended.

813
00:59:02,642 --> 00:59:04,122
Commissioner's orders.

814
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:07,962
So, what do we do till
the CB CID solves the case?

815
00:59:08,202 --> 00:59:11,562
Sit and stare at each other?
What else can we do!

816
00:59:12,202 --> 00:59:14,682
Our unit will be the loser.

817
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,962
The CB CID will conduct the inquiry.

818
00:59:22,203 --> 00:59:24,323
They think we can't do it.

819
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:26,603
Are we that pathetic?

820
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:30,683
We cannot let Abbas's death
be in vain.

821
00:59:31,483 --> 00:59:32,644
Vedha.

822
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,763
Let's kill that rat.

823
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:38,843
But no one knows where
the lowlife is hiding.

824
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:46,003
His lawyer must know.

825
00:59:54,644 --> 00:59:55,764
Hello. Yes, sir.

826
00:59:56,324 --> 00:59:58,964
<i>They'll charge him with something
and arrest him.</i>

827
00:59:59,404 --> 01:00:01,325
<i>File for anticipatory
bail immediately.</i>

828
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:02,084
Yes.

829
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:03,845
<i>I'll get the documents ready.</i>

830
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:05,885
<i>We need Mr. Vedha's signature.</i>

831
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:07,085
<i>Call him and...</i>

832
01:00:07,205 --> 01:00:10,285
Sir, I can't call him.
His phone must be tapped.

833
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:12,805
<i>So how do we get his signature?</i>

834
01:00:13,045 --> 01:00:14,084
I'll get it, sir.

835
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:47,766
Forgotten how to drive over 40?

836
01:00:47,886 --> 01:00:50,486
- Sir, madam is ahead of us.
- She's his lawyer.

837
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,086
She knows where Vedha is.

838
01:01:06,927 --> 01:01:07,927
A text.

839
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:10,807
Who sent the message to Priya?
Trace the number.

840
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:11,887
Yes, sir.

841
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:17,167
- Tell Prabhakar to overtake us.
- Yes, sir.

842
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,567
- Tell Giri to follow her.
- Yes.

843
01:01:42,848 --> 01:01:44,968
Sir, madam is heading home.

844
01:01:51,648 --> 01:01:54,249
The phone's switched off now.
The last location was right here.

845
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,528
- Sir, I think...
- Hang on.

846
01:01:59,128 --> 01:02:01,608
A black SUV overtook us back there.

847
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:04,008
That's where they exchanged
documents.

848
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:05,769
Their car can't be far.

849
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:08,329
- Find it. Quick.
- Yes, sir.

850
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,929
Yes, Prabhakar?

851
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:23,329
Sir, we've found the car.

852
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:25,529
He's buying biriyani
in Mirza Market.

853
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:27,769
Follow him.

854
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:31,330
- Mirza Market.
- Yes, sir.

855
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,530
Sir, he just came out
of Murgiwali lane.

856
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,890
He has the file your wife
gave him.

857
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:46,410
OK, sir.

858
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:08,491
This is the right place, sir.

859
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:11,611
But which house?
Which lane did he go down?

860
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:44,332
Search every lane.

861
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:46,093
There are over 250 houses here, sir.

862
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:49,413
If we ask anyone here,
Vedha will find out.

863
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:51,253
Exactly.

864
01:03:52,012 --> 01:03:52,893
Move it!

865
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:54,693
- Come on, go. Go!
- Yes, sir.

866
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:05,213
Where is Vedha?

867
01:04:10,694 --> 01:04:12,333
Sir, the police have surrounded
the neighbourhood.

868
01:04:12,453 --> 01:04:14,133
If you stay here,
the police will arrest you.

869
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:23,734
The scum.

870
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:27,614
Brother, want to fly kites?

871
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:29,734
I'm playing hide n seek now.

872
01:04:29,854 --> 01:04:31,254
See you later.

873
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:34,734
- Found him?
- No.

874
01:04:45,095 --> 01:04:46,014
Brother Vedha.

875
01:04:56,255 --> 01:04:58,375
- Love you, Vedha.
- Love you too, aunt.

876
01:04:59,535 --> 01:05:01,935
- He must've gone this way.
- How to find him in this maze?

877
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:04,775
What are you doing here?

878
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:05,935
You bloody...

879
01:05:33,056 --> 01:05:35,936
Ansari, you go there.
Yashwant, come with me.

880
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:56,937
Over there.

881
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,259
So this is police work.

882
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,219
I underestimated you guys.

883
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:17,500
I was sad to hear about
your friend Abbas's death.

884
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,983
Why did you kill Abbas?

885
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:49,224
Why?

886
01:08:50,743 --> 01:08:51,583
Why?

887
01:08:54,344 --> 01:08:55,824
Why did you kill Abbas?

888
01:09:03,024 --> 01:09:04,464
Why did you kill Shatak?

889
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:17,665
Abbas was a good officer.
Shatak was a criminal.

890
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:19,904
How can you compare the two?

891
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:29,905
It's traumatic to lose
a loved one.

892
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,465
Damn it! It's the same emotion!

893
01:10:04,706 --> 01:10:06,106
It's the right time!

894
01:10:07,026 --> 01:10:08,026
And the right weather.

895
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:12,546
Shall I tell you a story?

896
01:10:24,187 --> 01:10:26,867
<i>Hey brother, look where you're going</i>

897
01:10:26,987 --> 01:10:29,507
<i>Not just ahead, not just back</i>

898
01:10:29,627 --> 01:10:32,187
<i>Not just left, not just right</i>

899
01:10:32,307 --> 01:10:36,107
<i>Not just up, down too</i>

900
01:10:36,227 --> 01:10:37,427
<i>Hey brother!</i>

901
01:10:37,547 --> 01:10:39,748
<i>Hey brother, look where you're going</i>

902
01:10:41,027 --> 01:10:41,747
<i>Is the job done?</i>

903
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:43,108
I'm heading towards Faizabad, sir.

904
01:10:43,228 --> 01:10:43,627
<i>Why?</i>

905
01:10:43,747 --> 01:10:45,187
I'll stop on the way.

906
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:47,388
<i>You should've killed him
back there, Vikram.</i>

907
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,387
A crowd was watching, sir.

908
01:10:49,948 --> 01:10:52,828
No problem. I'll finish him off
and call you sir.

909
01:10:53,028 --> 01:10:54,228
<i>OK! End it soon.</i>

910
01:11:00,388 --> 01:11:01,709
Sir, can I have a drag?

911
01:11:03,548 --> 01:11:05,708
Smoking is injurious to health.

912
01:11:06,989 --> 01:11:09,668
You will know in 10 mins
what that really means!

913
01:11:09,828 --> 01:11:10,789
Here.

914
01:11:15,389 --> 01:11:17,269
Life too is like a cigarette, sir!

915
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:19,429
One day it'll turn to ash.

916
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:23,709
Till then take as many drags as you can.

917
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:27,309
I've seen many lose their cool
once they step out of their vehicle.

918
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,069
Those guys give our profession
a bad name.

919
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:46,950
Wasn't your father a cop too?

920
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:48,790
Didn't he die in the line of duty?

921
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:52,590
Thanks to a criminal like you
who fired before my father could.

922
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,791
No wonder you don't believe
in long conversations.

923
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:03,550
Sir, why are you looking for your
father's 1985 bullet chain sprocket?

924
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,430
It's been 36-years.
You won't find one now.

925
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:09,271
Have you been spying on me?

926
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,791
Is that why you used my wife?

927
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:13,990
Sir...

928
01:12:14,111 --> 01:12:17,551
You don't show it, sir,
but you're an emotional guy.

929
01:12:19,151 --> 01:12:21,511
Or else why try fixing
an old motorcycle?

930
01:12:21,911 --> 01:12:22,951
That's not it.

931
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:25,991
It was rotting in my garage,
I thought I'd have it fixed.

932
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:28,511
And Muni, sir?

933
01:12:29,231 --> 01:12:31,112
The man you killed in the encounter.

934
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:35,111
You pay for his son's education, right?

935
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:39,431
- You're an emotional guy.
- Balls to emotions!

936
01:12:39,671 --> 01:12:43,632
I don't want one criminal to die
and be replaced by another.

937
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:45,752
How are you so sure, sir,

938
01:12:45,912 --> 01:12:48,672
that a cop's son will be a cop,
a criminal's son will be a criminal?

939
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:54,192
Then Einstein's father and son
would be like Einstein.

940
01:12:55,593 --> 01:12:56,832
Do you even know their names?

941
01:12:57,672 --> 01:12:58,833
Cut the crap!

942
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:04,073
Get up and run!

943
01:13:04,272 --> 01:13:05,712
I will run, sir. I will.

944
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:07,992
But first hear my story.

945
01:13:09,473 --> 01:13:10,993
Aren't you very emotional
about Abbas?

946
01:13:12,753 --> 01:13:14,713
My story has the same emotion.

947
01:13:15,633 --> 01:13:17,953
Think of it as my last wish
and hear me out, sir.

948
01:13:21,394 --> 01:13:22,873
Thief! Thief!

949
01:13:30,954 --> 01:13:33,354
Only two people can save you
when you're in trouble,

950
01:13:33,634 --> 01:13:35,914
Lord Bajrangbali or Vedha Betal.

951
01:13:37,874 --> 01:13:39,954
Where have you kept all the MLAs?

952
01:13:42,234 --> 01:13:46,034
Never question good fortune.

953
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,595
Tell Parshuram I said hello.

954
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:51,635
We'll be late getting
to Aminabad.

955
01:13:51,755 --> 01:13:53,394
So I'll step on it. Full speed.

956
01:13:56,714 --> 01:13:57,674
Oh man!

957
01:13:58,274 --> 01:14:01,195
The traffic won't ease up
if you keep honking.

958
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:05,475
It's never so crowded
in the afternoons.

959
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:08,195
What did you say?

960
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:09,395
Brother, tissues?

961
01:14:52,996 --> 01:14:53,716
Kill him!

962
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:17,157
Vedha.

963
01:15:17,837 --> 01:15:19,517
Don't stare at me! Run.

964
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:46,719
Brother!

965
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:45,481
Your Mother...!

966
01:17:12,602 --> 01:17:13,521
I'll fix you.

967
01:17:21,882 --> 01:17:23,322
Why help me?

968
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:25,162
Should I have just stood by?

969
01:17:35,122 --> 01:17:35,962
What are you doing?

970
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:37,843
Why are you screaming, brother?

971
01:17:38,122 --> 01:17:39,322
It's his day for screaming.

972
01:17:39,922 --> 01:17:42,202
I don't want you mixed up
in this mess.

973
01:17:42,802 --> 01:17:44,203
Why did you get into this mess?

974
01:17:45,603 --> 01:17:46,843
Why not?

975
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:50,163
We had nothing.

976
01:17:51,643 --> 01:17:52,883
This is how I earned my swag?

977
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:54,683
Lucknow's famous for two things:

978
01:17:54,923 --> 01:17:58,283
Tunday kebab and Vedha's swag.

979
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:01,643
How did you earn your swag?

980
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:05,084
Powerful men bowed to me.

981
01:18:05,243 --> 01:18:07,403
- How did that happen?
- Through my own power.

982
01:18:07,523 --> 01:18:08,324
And how did you get it?

983
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:10,924
Money.

984
01:18:11,003 --> 01:18:12,684
If money could be earned honestly,

985
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:14,324
then why bother with this mess?

986
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:16,244
What are you talking about?

987
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:21,404
Look here.

988
01:18:22,485 --> 01:18:24,885
Aunt used to sell poppadums
on the street.

989
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,684
Now people line up at her shop.

990
01:18:27,804 --> 01:18:29,565
They wait hours to buy them.

991
01:18:29,844 --> 01:18:30,684
And here.

992
01:18:31,485 --> 01:18:34,565
Baiju Biryani Centre?
It started as a street stall.

993
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,804
Now they have branches
all over Lucknow.

994
01:18:36,924 --> 01:18:38,685
They even export biryani to Dubai.

995
01:18:39,805 --> 01:18:40,765
How did that happen?

996
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:46,525
The 500,000 you gave me
for expenses,

997
01:18:47,485 --> 01:18:48,765
I invested it in their business,

998
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:50,965
in their hard work and honesty.

999
01:18:51,925 --> 01:18:53,926
Small loan, big smile, brother!

1000
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:58,806
Things looked up for them,
and we made big profits.

1001
01:18:59,086 --> 01:19:00,646
All legal, after-tax.

1002
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,166
Brother,

1003
01:19:04,126 --> 01:19:05,485
give me a chance.

1004
01:19:05,886 --> 01:19:08,486
Make a big investment
in my company.

1005
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:12,606
So you can keep your reputation
and I can keep my word.

1006
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:15,686
Brother...

1007
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:35,247
Why make up such a long story?
Come to the point.

1008
01:19:35,847 --> 01:19:37,247
Don't waste my time.

1009
01:19:43,767 --> 01:19:45,567
Small loan, big smile.

1010
01:19:49,447 --> 01:19:51,408
Small loan, big smile.

1011
01:19:52,927 --> 01:19:53,768
Thank you, brother.

1012
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:57,408
No mention. I know that much
English.

1013
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,529
Chanda, we'll make Vedha brother
stop all his illegal business.

1014
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,888
From tomorrow we'll lead
a white-collar life.

1015
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:23,248
You listening?

1016
01:20:23,488 --> 01:20:24,688
Isn't it great news?

1017
01:20:24,928 --> 01:20:26,689
You're always carrying on about Vedha.

1018
01:20:27,328 --> 01:20:29,929
Vedha will never give up
the world of crime.

1019
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:31,969
Nor will you stop praising
your brother.

1020
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:34,289
You know what? Get out!

1021
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:36,009
Go live with your brother.

1022
01:20:36,129 --> 01:20:38,449
He'll pamper you like a child.

1023
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:39,529
Shut up!

1024
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:48,530
You've always been on his side.

1025
01:20:49,049 --> 01:20:50,729
I still don't mean anything to you.

1026
01:20:52,169 --> 01:20:54,089
I know what you think of me.

1027
01:20:55,409 --> 01:20:59,570
I'm older than you. So why would you
marry me?

1028
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:02,770
You're grown up,

1029
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:04,850
but you still cling onto Vedha.

1030
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,010
You're an idiot.

1031
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:07,250
Chanda,

1032
01:21:07,971 --> 01:21:11,211
I work 18-hours a day.
Who is it for? It's for you!

1033
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:15,090
You're my life.

1034
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:18,251
Oh? You forgot to wish me
happy birthday too!

1035
01:21:19,131 --> 01:21:22,650
It slipped my mind.
It's no big deal...

1036
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,091
You never admit your mistakes.

1037
01:21:25,211 --> 01:21:25,931
Shut up!

1038
01:21:26,891 --> 01:21:28,731
Another word from you
and I'll strangle you.

1039
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:40,411
You remembered.

1040
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:48,852
Your mother...

1041
01:21:49,372 --> 01:21:52,252
- What language is that?
- Marathi, I guess.

1042
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:55,132
Why is the Mumbai gang after us?

1043
01:21:55,692 --> 01:21:57,292
We have nothing against them.

1044
01:21:57,452 --> 01:21:59,212
Why rob from a robber?

1045
01:21:59,732 --> 01:22:00,852
What has the world come to!

1046
01:22:01,052 --> 01:22:05,732
You fool, we're not thieves,
we're gangsters.

1047
01:22:05,972 --> 01:22:07,212
There's a difference.

1048
01:22:07,853 --> 01:22:08,933
What's the difference?

1049
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:13,213
Thieves and ruffians work alone.

1050
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:17,132
We're a gang. The Vedha gang.
Therefore...gangsters.

1051
01:22:17,252 --> 01:22:19,373
- The Vedha gang.
- Exactly.

1052
01:22:19,693 --> 01:22:21,533
Show me your tongue.

1053
01:22:22,293 --> 01:22:24,813
All your sucking up has shrunk it.

1054
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,013
You know nothing,
but you act so smart.

1055
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,534
I would've known if they were
local goons.

1056
01:22:33,654 --> 01:22:35,053
I watch everyone.

1057
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:39,254
The Mumbai gang has made
big trouble...

1058
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,574
Every problem has a solution.

1059
01:22:46,454 --> 01:22:47,974
Just look for it.

1060
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:50,294
I see nothing, bro.

1061
01:22:52,374 --> 01:22:54,334
One of us ratted.

1062
01:22:56,734 --> 01:22:59,815
Who gains from our defeat? Think!

1063
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:11,895
- Boss.
- Vedha.

1064
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:13,534
Vedha Betal.

1065
01:23:15,255 --> 01:23:16,655
An advance from Mithilesh.

1066
01:23:16,855 --> 01:23:17,855
10 million.

1067
01:23:18,335 --> 01:23:19,455
Ravi.

1068
01:23:23,695 --> 01:23:25,575
Count it and put it in the car, Muni.

1069
01:23:26,015 --> 01:23:28,935
Ravi, have we ever counted
the cash Vedha gives us?

1070
01:23:31,535 --> 01:23:33,776
I've ordered something special
for you today.

1071
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:34,895
Really?

1072
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:37,816
You get the best 'kulcha-nihari' here.

1073
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:41,735
- I see.
- Gajju's famous Dhaba. That's Gajju.

1074
01:23:44,496 --> 01:23:47,456
Vedha, I hear you've started
a new business.

1075
01:23:48,136 --> 01:23:49,336
You can double the money.

1076
01:23:50,536 --> 01:23:51,896
Nothing escapes you.

1077
01:23:53,736 --> 01:23:55,497
The business is called Shatak.

1078
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,416
He invests money and earns
three times its value.

1079
01:23:58,896 --> 01:24:02,297
Cricket betting? The police are
cracking down on gambling.

1080
01:24:02,457 --> 01:24:03,336
Be careful.

1081
01:24:04,577 --> 01:24:07,337
Shatak stays away from anything illegal,
everything he does is totally legal.

1082
01:24:10,377 --> 01:24:12,817
Boss...try it.

1083
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,377
What are you doing?
Let me show you.

1084
01:24:20,297 --> 01:24:25,618
First wrap the bread around
the nihari.

1085
01:24:27,538 --> 01:24:30,258
Then dip it in the gravy
three times.

1086
01:24:30,418 --> 01:24:32,698
One, two, three...

1087
01:24:33,058 --> 01:24:34,738
Straight into your mouth.

1088
01:24:37,417 --> 01:24:39,138
Close your eyes and enjoy.

1089
01:24:44,618 --> 01:24:46,658
What do we say in Kanpur?

1090
01:24:46,858 --> 01:24:49,859
Delicious! That's what this is.

1091
01:24:50,099 --> 01:24:51,578
Brother has a point, boss.

1092
01:24:56,618 --> 01:24:59,498
Ravi, put the money in Vedha's car.

1093
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:03,859
Tell Shatak to invest my money,

1094
01:25:04,459 --> 01:25:05,859
and double it.

1095
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:18,780
Shatak, we have our investment!

1096
01:25:19,179 --> 01:25:19,740
Yes!

1097
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,780
Brother is flying high!

1098
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:43,820
<i>Senseless since dawn.
Glowing since dawn</i>

1099
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,741
<i>Blood flowing since dawn</i>

1100
01:25:47,581 --> 01:25:53,380
<i>My senses swaying senselessly.
Even nomads would lose control</i>

1101
01:25:54,301 --> 01:25:57,661
<i>I promised not to drink,
but drank too much</i>

1102
01:25:57,781 --> 01:26:00,661
<i>Your eyes are like drops of wine</i>

1103
01:26:00,901 --> 01:26:07,501
<i>The season has turned Alcoholiya!</i>

1104
01:26:22,502 --> 01:26:28,142
<i>I dipped my face in wine.
The thirsty come swinging by</i>

1105
01:26:29,502 --> 01:26:32,462
<i>No counting drinks today,
but today will count for me</i>

1106
01:26:32,582 --> 01:26:35,622
<i>Fill those glasses and pass them here</i>

1107
01:26:36,262 --> 01:26:38,902
<i>I stand at your doorway,
longing to see you</i>

1108
01:26:39,462 --> 01:26:41,703
<i>Fill me with love</i>

1109
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:47,943
<i>The season has turned Alcoholiya!</i>

1110
01:27:13,343 --> 01:27:14,863
<i>Oh those grapes of wine</i>

1111
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:16,504
<i>Oh my helpless heart</i>

1112
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:19,864
<i>Rob me, but I'll keep smiling</i>

1113
01:27:20,344 --> 01:27:21,784
<i>Stop drinking!</i>

1114
01:27:22,063 --> 01:27:23,384
<i>Unbearable thought</i>

1115
01:27:23,824 --> 01:27:26,944
<i>If the bottle is Laila,
the heart is Majnu. So, sing!</i>

1116
01:27:27,064 --> 01:27:30,184
<i>Alcoholiya, Alcoholiya</i>

1117
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:33,864
<i>Pull that towel between your legs
and dance!</i>

1118
01:27:34,104 --> 01:27:36,944
<i>Alcoholiya! Alcoholiya!</i>

1119
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:40,824
<i>Drinking turns Lucknow into Mangolia!</i>

1120
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:42,865
<i>Don't hesitate</i>

1121
01:27:43,105 --> 01:27:44,624
<i>Keep dancing</i>

1122
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:47,744
<i>Wash shyness away</i>

1123
01:27:49,345 --> 01:27:52,585
<i>The season has turned...</i>

1124
01:27:53,865 --> 01:27:56,465
<i>...Alcoholiya!</i>

1125
01:28:19,706 --> 01:28:22,346
<i>Alcoholiya!</i>

1126
01:28:44,107 --> 01:28:46,307
<i>Alcoholiya!</i>

1127
01:28:50,347 --> 01:28:51,707
Shatak.

1128
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:01,907
What is it?

1129
01:29:02,027 --> 01:29:04,748
It's called the ultimate pleasure, Shatak.

1130
01:29:05,068 --> 01:29:06,227
Marijuana.

1131
01:29:06,548 --> 01:29:08,108
It looks like a cigarette
on the outside.

1132
01:29:08,308 --> 01:29:11,747
Filled with the good stuff
on the inside.

1133
01:29:12,628 --> 01:29:15,628
My side business. Big profits.
Here.

1134
01:29:15,868 --> 01:29:17,508
Have a drag.

1135
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:21,988
- Brother...
- So early in the morning?

1136
01:29:23,748 --> 01:29:26,548
Bablu, how are things?

1137
01:29:27,348 --> 01:29:29,548
- Business good?
- Absolutely, brother.

1138
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:34,229
Thanks to you and to Lord Shiva's grace,
I paid last month's 20% on time.

1139
01:29:35,349 --> 01:29:37,949
- Are you a devotee of Lord Shiva?
- Yes.

1140
01:29:38,309 --> 01:29:40,389
Can I ask you a question
about Lord Shiva?

1141
01:29:40,589 --> 01:29:41,749
Go ahead.

1142
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:47,789
The snake around His neck?
Why is it there?

1143
01:29:48,789 --> 01:29:51,949
Is it for Lord Shiva's protection?
Or for the snake's?

1144
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:54,349
What do you think?

1145
01:29:58,229 --> 01:30:00,390
Shall I tell you what I think?

1146
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,270
If the snake slips away
from Lord Shiva,

1147
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:06,349
will it make any difference
to the Lord?

1148
01:30:07,789 --> 01:30:09,230
What happens to the snake?

1149
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:15,350
An eagle or crow will grab it
and fly away.

1150
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:17,870
The snake will become
someone's breakfast.

1151
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,790
You're right!

1152
01:30:23,070 --> 01:30:24,590
You're that snake.

1153
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:29,111
Treat me as your Lord.

1154
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:35,831
You're safe as long as you're
wrapped around my neck.

1155
01:30:38,751 --> 01:30:41,791
So shouldn't my share be at least 50%?

1156
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:45,431
- 50%.
- 50?

1157
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:46,831
50?

1158
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:49,992
I'm making you my partner.

1159
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:53,112
Gajju, time to celebrate.

1160
01:30:53,511 --> 01:30:54,511
Sure.

1161
01:30:56,751 --> 01:30:59,511
- Bablu...
- A celebration!

1162
01:30:59,672 --> 01:31:01,032
Cheers, partner.

1163
01:31:01,512 --> 01:31:03,312
Cheers... partner.

1164
01:31:18,032 --> 01:31:19,753
Have you thought about
Parshuram's money?

1165
01:31:19,873 --> 01:31:21,952
- How will you invest it?
- I have a plan...

1166
01:31:22,873 --> 01:31:25,233
Brother Sanki, where did you keep
the money?

1167
01:31:26,872 --> 01:31:27,913
At Chanda's.

1168
01:31:29,353 --> 01:31:31,153
- You messed up again.
- Why?

1169
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,473
I'll be right back.

1170
01:31:35,913 --> 01:31:36,633
Go. Run.

1171
01:31:42,273 --> 01:31:44,193
Chanda's granny! Want a kulfi?

1172
01:31:47,273 --> 01:31:48,393
Chanda!

1173
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:50,794
Chanda!

1174
01:31:59,114 --> 01:32:00,354
Chanda!

1175
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:10,954
Hello? Brother?

1176
01:32:11,154 --> 01:32:13,395
The money was taken,
I understand...

1177
01:32:13,954 --> 01:32:14,794
But why take Chanda?

1178
01:32:14,914 --> 01:32:16,275
It must be the Mumbai gang.

1179
01:32:18,395 --> 01:32:20,154
Who's the traitor amongst us?

1180
01:32:24,875 --> 01:32:26,875
Vedha. Why are you hitting me?

1181
01:32:28,315 --> 01:32:29,835
Why lose your cool?

1182
01:32:32,235 --> 01:32:33,395
Vedha!

1183
01:32:37,756 --> 01:32:41,275
Boss, see how he manhandles me
in your presence.

1184
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:43,795
He took the money.

1185
01:32:44,035 --> 01:32:46,675
He's rotten. Now he's grabbing
my collar.

1186
01:32:47,515 --> 01:32:51,076
I always knew that he
and his young brother...

1187
01:32:52,356 --> 01:32:54,356
Enough, Vedha. Stop!

1188
01:32:56,276 --> 01:32:57,556
I don't doubt Ravi.

1189
01:33:04,556 --> 01:33:05,876
I gave you the money.

1190
01:33:06,557 --> 01:33:07,676
So you are responsible.

1191
01:33:08,556 --> 01:33:10,476
Until the money is returned,

1192
01:33:11,756 --> 01:33:14,156
Ravi will handle
MLA Mithilesh's work.

1193
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:25,437
<i>Where will we get so much money?</i>

1194
01:33:25,837 --> 01:33:27,757
<i>If Mithilesh finds out,
we're done for.</i>

1195
01:33:28,517 --> 01:33:29,957
<i>How did it all this happen?</i>

1196
01:33:30,637 --> 01:33:32,598
<i>All roads are now closed to us.</i>

1197
01:33:33,517 --> 01:33:35,277
<i>What do we do?</i>

1198
01:33:36,237 --> 01:33:38,037
<i>Brother, will anyone help us?</i>

1199
01:33:41,358 --> 01:33:42,398
Brother.

1200
01:33:42,678 --> 01:33:44,198
It's been two days!

1201
01:34:04,318 --> 01:34:05,438
Chanda!

1202
01:34:06,398 --> 01:34:07,399
Chanda, where are you?

1203
01:34:09,159 --> 01:34:10,239
Shatak.

1204
01:34:11,319 --> 01:34:13,519
I've been waiting for your call.

1205
01:34:15,118 --> 01:34:17,359
Where are you?
Who abducted you?

1206
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:19,559
Who should I name?

1207
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,319
It was me.

1208
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:26,242
When I saw the money, I thought
I could make my dreams come true.

1209
01:35:28,441 --> 01:35:30,922
But when I was on the run,
I realised,

1210
01:35:33,802 --> 01:35:36,162
I was leaving behind my most
precious dream.

1211
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:11,683
Brother, forget about why she ran,

1212
01:36:12,643 --> 01:36:15,163
think about what brought her back.

1213
01:36:26,163 --> 01:36:27,483
Bravo, Vedha!

1214
01:36:28,244 --> 01:36:31,524
You want to defeat the man
who taught you the game.

1215
01:36:32,684 --> 01:36:35,724
And where did you choose to strike?
In brother's house!

1216
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:38,044
Ravi!

1217
01:36:39,044 --> 01:36:40,004
The money's back.

1218
01:36:44,404 --> 01:36:45,404
Vedha.

1219
01:36:47,324 --> 01:36:48,964
We thrive on fear.

1220
01:36:50,084 --> 01:36:54,885
When people hear what that
two-bit woman did to us,

1221
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,724
and that we did nothing,

1222
01:36:58,645 --> 01:36:59,805
then who'll fear us?

1223
01:37:03,645 --> 01:37:05,405
If my reign of terror is over,

1224
01:37:06,565 --> 01:37:07,605
then I'm done.

1225
01:37:12,605 --> 01:37:16,805
We must stick to the ethics
of our trade.

1226
01:37:17,606 --> 01:37:19,886
You know what our ethics demand.

1227
01:37:23,966 --> 01:37:25,246
Finish the girl.

1228
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:34,486
Vikram sir! Another moral dilemma.

1229
01:37:35,446 --> 01:37:36,806
What will Vedha do?

1230
01:37:37,806 --> 01:37:41,406
If he upholds our ethics, Chanda
is dead. If she's dead, so is Shatak.

1231
01:37:41,926 --> 01:37:45,246
If I'm loyal to blood ties, it means
turning against Parshuram.

1232
01:37:46,006 --> 01:37:47,247
What will Vedha choose?

1233
01:37:48,126 --> 01:37:50,567
Ethics? Or emotion?

1234
01:37:51,207 --> 01:37:53,007
Let me explain it like you do.

1235
01:37:53,127 --> 01:37:54,087
Hey...

1236
01:37:54,606 --> 01:37:55,767
This...

1237
01:37:56,807 --> 01:37:58,047
Remember the line?

1238
01:37:58,287 --> 01:38:01,047
This is it. The line of control.

1239
01:38:02,127 --> 01:38:05,047
This side of the line is good,
that side is evil.

1240
01:38:05,287 --> 01:38:07,807
In the earlier story,
both were wrong.

1241
01:38:08,767 --> 01:38:12,847
But in this story,
they're both right.

1242
01:38:14,368 --> 01:38:15,888
Who will you side with, sir?

1243
01:38:17,328 --> 01:38:19,567
Parshuram? Or Shatak?

1244
01:38:20,448 --> 01:38:22,288
Ethics? Or emotion?

1245
01:38:27,088 --> 01:38:28,808
Parshuram is powerful.

1246
01:38:29,368 --> 01:38:31,928
And Shatak's only strength
is his brother.

1247
01:38:32,848 --> 01:38:35,609
Rebelling against Parshuram
means fighting the world.

1248
01:38:36,209 --> 01:38:39,089
But Shatak's world is only made up
of you and Chanda.

1249
01:38:39,888 --> 01:38:42,569
If I was in your place,
I'd side with Shatak.

1250
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:46,249
Because Shatak is innocent.
There's goodness in him.

1251
01:38:54,129 --> 01:38:55,249
You're right, sir.

1252
01:38:56,969 --> 01:38:58,569
Shatak was innocent.

1253
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:09,409
Vedha did as you would have.

1254
01:39:10,089 --> 01:39:11,570
I chose emotion, too.

1255
01:39:12,249 --> 01:39:16,890
Sent Chanda and Shatak to Mumbai.
Paid the full price for her actions.

1256
01:39:18,009 --> 01:39:19,410
Full gang war!

1257
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:39,850
I didn't kill Abbas, sir.

1258
01:39:40,851 --> 01:39:43,090
You want to know why Abbas died?

1259
01:39:44,371 --> 01:39:46,810
First find out why Shatak
was killed.

1260
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:49,371
As the law dictates, sir,

1261
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:52,091
first investigate, then judge.

1262
01:39:53,051 --> 01:39:55,571
Don't announce the verdict
without investigation, sir.

1263
01:40:03,371 --> 01:40:05,771
<i>We should know by looking
into someone's eyes</i>

1264
01:40:05,891 --> 01:40:06,932
<i>whether he's a criminal or not.</i>

1265
01:40:08,972 --> 01:40:11,531
<i>Do you know why we sleep peacefully
after every encounter?</i>

1266
01:40:11,732 --> 01:40:15,892
<i>Because we know we didn't kill
an innocent person.</i>

1267
01:40:23,292 --> 01:40:24,212
This...

1268
01:40:38,573 --> 01:40:39,573
- Priya...
- Don't touch me.

1269
01:40:44,853 --> 01:40:46,733
Priya, I did what I thought
was right at that time.

1270
01:40:48,613 --> 01:40:51,373
I was just doing...my job.

1271
01:40:53,014 --> 01:40:55,853
You used me for your job,
and you thought that was right.

1272
01:40:57,454 --> 01:40:58,573
You tapped my phone.

1273
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:02,574
Show me.

1274
01:41:04,254 --> 01:41:05,293
Don't move.

1275
01:41:13,414 --> 01:41:16,054
I can't figure out if
I'm living with my husband,

1276
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,054
or a police officer.

1277
01:41:26,334 --> 01:41:29,135
I've warned you once.
Now move!

1278
01:41:29,615 --> 01:41:31,175
Must I do everything for you?

1279
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:34,295
The car keys.

1280
01:41:34,615 --> 01:41:35,735
Where were you, brother?

1281
01:41:36,134 --> 01:41:38,335
The police have issued orders
to shoot on sight.

1282
01:41:39,535 --> 01:41:41,615
I've made all the arrangements
at the Kursi Road warehouse.

1283
01:41:41,735 --> 01:41:43,255
Go underground immediately.

1284
01:41:44,615 --> 01:41:47,535
Give me the car keys.

1285
01:41:48,456 --> 01:41:50,415
I don't know your game, brother.

1286
01:41:50,775 --> 01:41:52,575
Vikram is not like
the other officers.

1287
01:41:52,975 --> 01:41:54,096
Please be careful.

1288
01:41:55,656 --> 01:41:56,976
Of all the lawyers in the state,

1289
01:41:57,176 --> 01:41:59,175
you had to appoint his wife
to defend you?

1290
01:41:59,535 --> 01:42:00,696
Because of her...

1291
01:42:11,856 --> 01:42:13,696
- Vikram...
- That's enough, Mr. Vedha.

1292
01:42:14,656 --> 01:42:17,857
I'll inform my seniors
that I cannot work for you.

1293
01:42:18,496 --> 01:42:19,537
You've crossed a line.

1294
01:42:20,816 --> 01:42:23,776
Sometimes for the greater goal
you must cross that line.

1295
01:42:23,896 --> 01:42:25,177
I've been watching you.

1296
01:42:25,977 --> 01:42:28,456
I've noticed you've been riding
on Vikram's back for a while.

1297
01:42:29,296 --> 01:42:30,457
But why Vikram?

1298
01:42:31,336 --> 01:42:34,057
There are 285,000 police officers
in this state.

1299
01:42:34,417 --> 01:42:35,177
Why him?

1300
01:42:37,657 --> 01:42:40,617
I only ask questions of people
who can find answers.

1301
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:43,457
What are you looking for?

1302
01:42:44,577 --> 01:42:45,617
What do you want?

1303
01:42:47,258 --> 01:42:48,377
I once wanted...

1304
01:42:51,017 --> 01:42:53,338
my aunt to sell poppadums
all over the world.

1305
01:42:54,778 --> 01:42:56,978
And movie stars would wear
Sikander's shoes.

1306
01:42:57,737 --> 01:42:59,378
And Baiju's biryani would sell out.

1307
01:43:03,218 --> 01:43:05,698
I wanted to help others
realise their dreams.

1308
01:43:08,578 --> 01:43:10,218
Small loan, big smile.

1309
01:43:13,098 --> 01:43:14,418
He wanted to change me.

1310
01:43:17,379 --> 01:43:19,698
My younger brother Shatak.

1311
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:23,099
He was no criminal, madam.

1312
01:43:24,579 --> 01:43:26,379
But he was murdered
in an encounter.

1313
01:43:35,499 --> 01:43:37,179
I asked Vikram sir a question.

1314
01:43:38,699 --> 01:43:41,140
He will be at a loss
looking for the answer.

1315
01:43:42,979 --> 01:43:44,339
That's when he'll need your help.

1316
01:44:06,821 --> 01:44:08,540
<i>I've sent Chanda and Shatak to Mumbai.</i>

1317
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,900
Vedha sent Chanda and Shatak to Mumbai.

1318
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,500
Why would they risk their lives
by returning?

1319
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:18,581
Abbas and Shatak.

1320
01:44:19,861 --> 01:44:21,701
Their deaths must be connected
somehow.

1321
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:24,421
We must find out why Shatak died.

1322
01:44:26,021 --> 01:44:27,821
You guys went after Muni,

1323
01:44:28,621 --> 01:44:31,261
and found Shatak by coincidence.

1324
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:32,661
Sorry, sir.

1325
01:44:33,181 --> 01:44:35,262
I don't believe in coincidence.

1326
01:44:35,622 --> 01:44:38,022
Everything has a reason.

1327
01:44:38,341 --> 01:44:39,781
The enquiry led us to believe

1328
01:44:39,901 --> 01:44:42,942
Chanda returned to Lucknow
for her grandmother's funeral.

1329
01:44:43,142 --> 01:44:43,902
Right, Vikram?

1330
01:44:44,022 --> 01:44:45,222
Where are the other photos?

1331
01:44:51,862 --> 01:44:52,982
Look at this, sir.

1332
01:44:54,662 --> 01:44:55,702
Ligature marks.

1333
01:44:56,462 --> 01:44:57,942
Chanda was held captive.

1334
01:44:58,422 --> 01:45:01,303
She was tied up. It means
she was abducted.

1335
01:45:02,222 --> 01:45:03,182
But why?

1336
01:45:05,182 --> 01:45:07,222
- Where are Shatak's phone records?
- Here, sir.

1337
01:45:17,062 --> 01:45:19,263
It's clear, sir.
The dates match.

1338
01:45:19,943 --> 01:45:22,503
Shatak landed in Lucknow
a day before the encounter.

1339
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:27,223
He went looking for Chanda.

1340
01:45:28,424 --> 01:45:29,583
Vedha was underground.

1341
01:45:30,344 --> 01:45:32,423
There was only one way
of finding Chanda.

1342
01:45:33,143 --> 01:45:35,303
Shatak had to ask Muni
and his gang for help.

1343
01:45:36,344 --> 01:45:40,744
That's why they were meeting, and the
info was leaked to us on purpose.

1344
01:45:40,904 --> 01:45:44,504
So we'd get there and Shatak
would be killed in an encounter.

1345
01:45:45,784 --> 01:45:47,264
This is no coincidence, sir.

1346
01:45:48,144 --> 01:45:50,424
We're being used as pawns
in someone's game.

1347
01:45:53,224 --> 01:45:55,425
Hey...who tipped us off about Muni?

1348
01:45:56,344 --> 01:45:59,145
One of Abbas's guys...Pappu.

1349
01:45:59,505 --> 01:46:02,064
Yes, sir. This is it.
I've done my job.

1350
01:46:02,704 --> 01:46:03,664
Where can we find Pappu?

1351
01:46:12,624 --> 01:46:15,145
It's Muni and Raja Babu's
memorial service.

1352
01:46:17,465 --> 01:46:18,465
Next left, sir.

1353
01:46:22,665 --> 01:46:24,305
Since Vedha went underground,

1354
01:46:24,985 --> 01:46:26,905
all the mice are out to play.

1355
01:46:37,866 --> 01:46:39,546
Why is Parshuram here?

1356
01:46:42,186 --> 01:46:45,546
Sir, Pappu was last seen heading towards
the condemned bogies in the railway yard.

1357
01:46:47,346 --> 01:46:48,546
Let's go. Let's go.

1358
01:46:49,306 --> 01:46:51,866
Prabhakar, check all the bogies.

1359
01:47:01,027 --> 01:47:02,066
Pappu has been murdered.

1360
01:47:02,267 --> 01:47:03,707
The killer must still be in
the vicinity. Come on!

1361
01:47:03,986 --> 01:47:05,666
Someone wants us to not talk to Pappu.

1362
01:47:06,427 --> 01:47:07,307
You two, over there.

1363
01:47:07,427 --> 01:47:09,547
Lower your guns!
I want him alive.

1364
01:47:10,507 --> 01:47:13,387
The place is full of people.
Who are we looking for?

1365
01:47:15,667 --> 01:47:17,627
Sir, there's no one here.
I'll check the main yard.

1366
01:47:17,868 --> 01:47:20,187
Find him. He cannot escape.

1367
01:47:21,387 --> 01:47:22,587
What are we looking for?

1368
01:47:22,707 --> 01:47:23,748
As if I knew!

1369
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:05,989
Your Mother...!

1370
01:48:07,429 --> 01:48:08,869
Your Mother...!

1371
01:48:09,949 --> 01:48:11,469
Why is the Mumbai gang after me?

1372
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,030
Slimeball!

1373
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:15,869
How do we get out of here?

1374
01:48:46,990 --> 01:48:48,030
Who sent you?

1375
01:48:50,471 --> 01:48:51,711
Bloody Lilliput.

1376
01:49:12,071 --> 01:49:12,991
Sir...

1377
01:49:13,471 --> 01:49:14,471
It just went off.

1378
01:49:15,791 --> 01:49:16,912
He would've killed you.

1379
01:49:17,272 --> 01:49:18,832
You said we should know by looking
into someone's eyes

1380
01:49:18,952 --> 01:49:20,232
whether he's a criminal or not.

1381
01:49:21,712 --> 01:49:23,712
- Did I do something wrong, sir?
- No.

1382
01:49:25,752 --> 01:49:26,952
You did the right thing.

1383
01:49:28,632 --> 01:49:30,312
If you hadn't fired,
I would've been fried.

1384
01:49:31,712 --> 01:49:33,632
- Was that your first kill?
- Yes, sir.

1385
01:49:38,873 --> 01:49:40,632
Tell Prabhakar to complete
the formalities.

1386
01:49:40,832 --> 01:49:41,792
Yes, sir.

1387
01:49:52,433 --> 01:49:53,433
Priya.

1388
01:49:58,433 --> 01:49:59,433
Listen to me.

1389
01:50:09,234 --> 01:50:10,113
Priya.

1390
01:50:10,473 --> 01:50:11,954
Won't you even look at me?

1391
01:50:13,314 --> 01:50:15,393
Hear my argument before
you announce the verdict.

1392
01:50:17,793 --> 01:50:18,873
What is your argument?

1393
01:50:20,714 --> 01:50:24,114
This is not between a cop and
a lawyer, it's between you and me.

1394
01:50:26,834 --> 01:50:27,794
Can I suggest something?

1395
01:50:28,794 --> 01:50:31,274
From now on, lawyer and cop
stay outside the house.

1396
01:50:32,275 --> 01:50:35,114
Only Vikram and Priya
are allowed in. OK?

1397
01:50:39,475 --> 01:50:41,355
So you won't follow me
into the house?

1398
01:50:41,475 --> 01:50:42,355
No way.

1399
01:50:43,395 --> 01:50:44,395
OK.

1400
01:50:47,715 --> 01:50:50,715
- Well?
- I said the house, not the bedroom.

1401
01:50:56,955 --> 01:50:58,595
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

1402
01:51:04,635 --> 01:51:05,715
Seriously?

1403
01:51:05,835 --> 01:51:08,555
You said work stays out
of our home.

1404
01:51:12,875 --> 01:51:13,676
Tell me.

1405
01:51:15,476 --> 01:51:17,316
Priya, I won't beat around the bush.

1406
01:51:17,996 --> 01:51:19,836
I must talk to Vedha urgently.

1407
01:51:22,396 --> 01:51:23,996
No wonder you were in a hurry
to sweet-talk me.

1408
01:51:24,116 --> 01:51:25,116
No.

1409
01:51:25,956 --> 01:51:27,196
That's not it.

1410
01:51:27,876 --> 01:51:29,316
I don't know where he is.

1411
01:51:30,717 --> 01:51:33,117
- Priya...
- Vikram, I really don't...

1412
01:51:34,116 --> 01:51:35,556
<i>He'll be at a loss
looking for the answer.</i>

1413
01:51:35,757 --> 01:51:37,157
<i>That's when he'll need your help.</i>

1414
01:51:39,636 --> 01:51:41,997
So am I a courier service
between you two?

1415
01:51:42,876 --> 01:51:43,877
What?

1416
01:51:45,957 --> 01:51:48,517
Vedha told me if you're at a loss,

1417
01:51:48,637 --> 01:51:50,277
I must remind you of...

1418
01:51:50,797 --> 01:51:51,917
'Kulcha-nihari'.

1419
01:51:58,597 --> 01:51:59,917
Why 'kulcha-nihari'?

1420
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:03,558
- Thank you, sir!
- Take it away carefully.

1421
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:05,958
Please, sir.

1422
01:52:08,317 --> 01:52:09,358
What can I serve you, sir?

1423
01:52:10,198 --> 01:52:13,238
One 'kulcha-nihari' and Vedha.

1424
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:15,398
Yes, sir.

1425
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:23,078
<i>Let me show you.</i>

1426
01:52:23,399 --> 01:52:26,958
<i>First wrap the bread around
the nihari.</i>

1427
01:52:27,318 --> 01:52:28,958
<i>Then dip it into the gravy
three times.</i>

1428
01:52:29,078 --> 01:52:31,358
<i>One, two, three...</i>

1429
01:52:31,718 --> 01:52:33,398
<i>Straight into your mouth.</i>

1430
01:52:34,519 --> 01:52:36,479
<i>Close your eyes and enjoy.</i>

1431
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:40,279
Sir.

1432
01:52:42,959 --> 01:52:44,519
Vikram sir, did you enjoy it?

1433
01:52:46,599 --> 01:52:47,879
I have a gift for you.

1434
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:51,519
Get it from shop no. 16,
next to Sharma's tea stall.

1435
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:54,120
I have a gift for you, too.

1436
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:04,760
Who tipped off the Mumbai gang
about you, Vedha?

1437
01:53:22,561 --> 01:53:25,240
I mean the Shivgadh encounter
where Shatak died.

1438
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:27,400
Do you want to know
who tipped us off?

1439
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:40,681
It looks like a cigarette
on the outside.

1440
01:53:40,801 --> 01:53:43,802
Filled with good stuff
on the inside.

1441
01:53:45,041 --> 01:53:45,842
Babloo.

1442
01:53:46,082 --> 01:53:48,722
<i>The Mumbai gang was
working for your Babloo.</i>

1443
01:54:15,363 --> 01:54:19,883
<i>O Man, there is no difference
between black and white?</i>

1444
01:54:20,363 --> 01:54:23,043
<i>It's all perception</i>

1445
01:54:23,763 --> 01:54:26,643
<i>O Man, good and bad aren't
different things</i>

1446
01:54:26,763 --> 01:54:28,803
<i>The concept of heaven and hell,</i>

1447
01:54:29,003 --> 01:54:31,603
<i>sin and virtue - all worthless</i>

1448
01:54:32,083 --> 01:54:35,603
<i>What you've gained, what you've lost,
just let it go</i>

1449
01:54:36,243 --> 01:54:39,844
<i>It's all illusion, just let it go</i>

1450
01:54:40,403 --> 01:54:44,083
<i>What's right? What is not?
Who can figure out these nuances?</i>

1451
01:55:01,444 --> 01:55:04,364
<i>Who is god here? Tell me</i>

1452
01:55:05,564 --> 01:55:09,005
<i>Who is without mistakes? Tell me</i>

1453
01:55:09,764 --> 01:55:13,445
<i>There are stains of crime on you too,
just check</i>

1454
01:55:13,964 --> 01:55:17,845
<i>There is blood on your hands,
wash it off if you can</i>

1455
01:55:18,125 --> 01:55:21,164
<i>What a trap it is!</i>

1456
01:55:21,605 --> 01:55:25,565
<i>It's all deception, O Man</i>

1457
01:55:25,805 --> 01:55:30,485
<i>Look for the truth
behind the curtains</i>

1458
01:55:30,925 --> 01:55:34,686
<i>Are you blind, O Man?</i>

1459
01:55:53,286 --> 01:55:55,446
Vedha and Babloo are in
the Old Mill...

1460
01:55:55,566 --> 01:55:56,886
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1461
01:55:57,366 --> 01:55:58,806
<i>Don't risk your life, Vikram.</i>

1462
01:55:58,926 --> 01:56:00,486
<i>I can't afford to lose another man.</i>

1463
01:56:00,806 --> 01:56:03,446
<i>Wait outside. I'm coming
with backup.</i>

1464
01:56:03,806 --> 01:56:07,327
Don't worry, sir. I'll deal with them
before you get here.

1465
01:56:15,127 --> 01:56:17,367
Scum! You were the finger!

1466
01:56:19,847 --> 01:56:21,407
I was 7 years old,

1467
01:56:22,687 --> 01:56:24,487
I was in short pants

1468
01:56:25,087 --> 01:56:26,727
when I entered this business.

1469
01:56:28,447 --> 01:56:31,047
I slogged day and night,

1470
01:56:32,847 --> 01:56:34,928
hoping to see the fruits
of my labour.

1471
01:56:35,327 --> 01:56:36,728
I saw the fruits.

1472
01:56:37,607 --> 01:56:39,728
But when they were in my reach,

1473
01:56:40,528 --> 01:56:43,888
a dirty dog snatched them away.

1474
01:56:45,488 --> 01:56:50,368
See the irony? I've had to lick
that dirty dog's feet.

1475
01:56:53,688 --> 01:56:55,208
That's when I decided,

1476
01:56:56,409 --> 01:56:57,729
I would kill you

1477
01:56:59,169 --> 01:57:01,929
and all your men, one by one.

1478
01:57:06,009 --> 01:57:07,728
You're going to die.

1479
01:57:11,009 --> 01:57:12,288
Only after I do.

1480
01:57:14,769 --> 01:57:16,209
Brother Vedha!

1481
01:57:21,169 --> 01:57:22,409
Welcome, sir.

1482
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:26,290
Was it tough finding me?

1483
01:57:26,809 --> 01:57:28,090
I liked your gift.

1484
01:57:28,969 --> 01:57:29,770
Thank you.

1485
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:31,169
No mention.

1486
01:57:32,410 --> 01:57:33,769
Nice, huh?

1487
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:36,930
Everyone is having fun.
Me with you, you with me.

1488
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:39,649
And life is having fun
with the pair of us.

1489
01:57:41,010 --> 01:57:42,970
This is my 20-year-old long friend.

1490
01:57:43,210 --> 01:57:44,370
Brother Babloo.

1491
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:47,370
I even spared the scoundrel's life.

1492
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:51,731
You'd be stunned if you
heard his story.

1493
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:53,891
He has a story, too?

1494
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:57,570
You all are so alike.

1495
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:00,530
You're all the same.
Him. You.

1496
01:58:02,611 --> 01:58:03,851
No, sir.

1497
01:58:19,572 --> 01:58:20,892
What are you doing?

1498
01:58:21,811 --> 01:58:24,171
Don't you want to know
why Abbas was killed?

1499
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:28,172
No more stories. Tell me straight.

1500
01:58:31,412 --> 01:58:33,771
A friend dropped his wallet
on the street.

1501
01:58:34,092 --> 01:58:36,332
He came home and looked
for it everywhere.

1502
01:58:36,732 --> 01:58:38,092
I asked him: "What are you doing?

1503
01:58:38,412 --> 01:58:40,252
"You dropped it on the street,
and you're looking for it at home?

1504
01:58:40,372 --> 01:58:41,532
"You crazy?"

1505
01:58:41,972 --> 01:58:45,212
He said: "How do I look for it outside?
It's so dark there."

1506
01:58:49,492 --> 01:58:51,812
You need to shift your gaze, sir.

1507
01:58:53,653 --> 01:58:54,932
Enter the darkness.

1508
01:58:57,013 --> 01:58:57,772
Meaning?

1509
01:58:58,773 --> 01:59:02,653
Why was Abbas killed?
The answer is in my final story, sir.

1510
01:59:03,613 --> 01:59:05,733
Listen patiently and carefully.

1511
01:59:06,733 --> 01:59:08,533
This time you won't just enjoy it,

1512
01:59:10,693 --> 01:59:12,053
it'll astound you!

1513
01:59:15,333 --> 01:59:17,733
"Thief. Police."

1514
01:59:21,494 --> 01:59:23,774
<i>In the war, Parshuram was the king</i>

1515
01:59:24,494 --> 01:59:27,374
<i>and his elephant was Mithilesh Tiwari.</i>

1516
01:59:49,815 --> 01:59:51,335
I got the audition.

1517
01:59:51,894 --> 01:59:53,454
What if I get rejected?

1518
01:59:53,775 --> 01:59:56,015
No one could ever reject you.

1519
01:59:57,335 --> 01:59:59,094
Look! You're a lefty,
aren't you?

1520
02:00:00,015 --> 02:00:01,495
You eat with your left hand.

1521
02:00:01,975 --> 02:00:03,895
That's it! She's a born star.

1522
02:00:04,095 --> 02:00:05,375
You're right.

1523
02:00:12,935 --> 02:00:15,256
See. This is my love story.

1524
02:00:19,696 --> 02:00:20,935
I'll need another piece.

1525
02:00:24,535 --> 02:00:25,896
It's all my fault.

1526
02:00:26,335 --> 02:00:27,576
What is?

1527
02:00:28,136 --> 02:00:31,216
I forced you into this gang war,
otherwise...

1528
02:00:31,616 --> 02:00:34,896
A wise man never cries
over spilt milk.

1529
02:00:35,216 --> 02:00:37,337
He curdles it into cheese
and eats it.

1530
02:00:38,537 --> 02:00:41,417
Did you think I could work for
a man like Parshuram forever?

1531
02:00:42,017 --> 02:00:44,136
Why don't you move to Mumbai
and start a business?

1532
02:00:44,736 --> 02:00:46,457
You promised me. Remember?

1533
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:49,777
OK. Don't sulk.

1534
02:00:51,457 --> 02:00:52,457
It's time to go.

1535
02:01:11,418 --> 02:01:15,618
<i>How could I've known it was the
last time I'd see my Shatak and Chanda.</i>

1536
02:01:17,457 --> 02:01:21,018
There's a new twist in Lucknow's
mafia story.

1537
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:24,620
AK47.

1538
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:30,700
We need something to challenge
his AK47.

1539
02:02:32,980 --> 02:02:34,581
We'll find something.

1540
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:41,741
I'll create a gangster
greater than he is,

1541
02:02:43,661 --> 02:02:45,541
or my name isn't Babloo.

1542
02:02:45,781 --> 02:02:48,941
<i>The people of Lucknow live under
the trauma of gang war.</i>

1543
02:02:49,061 --> 02:02:53,341
<i>The police have created a special
task force to deal with the problem.</i>

1544
02:02:53,461 --> 02:02:55,661
<i>The team leader is SSP Abbas.</i>

1545
02:02:55,781 --> 02:02:58,861
<i>And in their team, they have brought in
an encounter specialist, SSP Vikram.</i>

1546
02:02:59,062 --> 02:03:00,781
I'm a big shot now!

1547
02:03:02,381 --> 02:03:04,501
I'll have to escape to London
or somewhere.

1548
02:03:08,902 --> 02:03:09,862
Who's that?

1549
02:03:09,982 --> 02:03:11,221
The police.

1550
02:03:21,302 --> 02:03:22,343
Hey...

1551
02:03:24,623 --> 02:03:25,862
No, no...

1552
02:03:42,183 --> 02:03:43,063
Kill me!

1553
02:04:14,264 --> 02:04:16,584
Just imagine they killed Kallu.

1554
02:04:17,824 --> 02:04:19,064
He was too young to die.

1555
02:04:20,144 --> 02:04:21,464
We're a target.

1556
02:04:23,144 --> 02:04:25,105
You must go underground, Vedha.

1557
02:04:26,665 --> 02:04:27,825
You stupid?

1558
02:04:28,545 --> 02:04:33,184
I say we go with all guns blazing,
and take revenge.

1559
02:04:33,465 --> 02:04:35,265
They kill 4, we kill 40.

1560
02:04:35,385 --> 02:04:37,305
Stop provoking him.

1561
02:04:37,825 --> 02:04:39,265
One of our boys was killed.

1562
02:04:40,425 --> 02:04:44,545
The cops should've shot you instead.
Always provoking him.

1563
02:05:04,506 --> 02:05:05,506
Can I say something?

1564
02:05:07,786 --> 02:05:10,466
We've seen enough wins and losses.
Been on the run for too long.

1565
02:05:10,826 --> 02:05:12,146
Time to stop.

1566
02:05:13,546 --> 02:05:15,867
You should take Shatak's advice
and move to Mumbai.

1567
02:05:17,787 --> 02:05:20,946
- You'd send me there alone?
- Not alone!

1568
02:05:21,747 --> 02:05:24,066
You go first, I'll be close behind.

1569
02:06:15,908 --> 02:06:17,549
Bloody scum!

1570
02:06:28,269 --> 02:06:30,709
- Where is Vedha?
- You said he was in the car.

1571
02:06:31,389 --> 02:06:32,629
He was.

1572
02:06:33,189 --> 02:06:34,709
He's escaped again.

1573
02:06:38,949 --> 02:06:40,069
Five million.

1574
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:43,830
These scumbags have brought
an AK47 from Mumbai.

1575
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:47,030
But I was true to my word.

1576
02:06:47,670 --> 02:06:48,710
Look, Sanki!

1577
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:51,590
I got a rogue cop of my own.

1578
02:06:51,789 --> 02:06:53,670
Slaughtered them like swine.

1579
02:06:54,590 --> 02:06:55,870
Abbas sir,

1580
02:06:56,430 --> 02:06:57,950
only Vedha is left.

1581
02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:01,990
I'll tip you off. You kill him.
Double the money.

1582
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:14,110
Yes, sir.

1583
02:07:14,791 --> 02:07:16,791
Your friend. Abbas.

1584
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:21,271
Good...evil. Police...criminal.
Truth...lies.

1585
02:07:21,871 --> 02:07:23,751
You love drawing lines, right?

1586
02:07:24,671 --> 02:07:25,831
Now which side are you on?

1587
02:07:26,231 --> 02:07:28,191
On that side, or this?

1588
02:07:28,911 --> 02:07:30,431
Or is the line no longer visible?

1589
02:07:30,911 --> 02:07:32,511
It's turned into a circle.

1590
02:07:33,191 --> 02:07:36,752
We're all going around in circles.
Round and round.

1591
02:07:44,072 --> 02:07:45,392
What do you think?

1592
02:07:46,112 --> 02:07:48,792
You'd tell me stories
and I'd believe you.

1593
02:07:50,352 --> 02:07:52,832
Abbas was taking money from Babloo
to carry out encounters.

1594
02:07:53,912 --> 02:07:55,552
Do you know how long
I've known Abbas?

1595
02:07:57,753 --> 02:07:59,592
Do I look stupid to you?

1596
02:08:00,993 --> 02:08:03,033
Vikram sir.

1597
02:08:04,152 --> 02:08:07,512
Blinkers cover a horse's eyes,
so it cannot see left or right.

1598
02:08:07,992 --> 02:08:09,593
Blinkers covered your eyes.

1599
02:08:12,393 --> 02:08:13,992
Abbas's son was ill.

1600
02:08:16,393 --> 02:08:17,673
How much was the treatment?

1601
02:08:18,353 --> 02:08:20,033
How did Abbas pay?
With his police salary?

1602
02:08:24,513 --> 02:08:25,993
The blinkers are slipping.

1603
02:08:29,033 --> 02:08:30,353
No.

1604
02:08:30,634 --> 02:08:32,314
If that was true, then Abbas...

1605
02:08:35,554 --> 02:08:36,913
Abbas would come to me.

1606
02:08:38,154 --> 02:08:39,474
How could he, sir?

1607
02:08:40,594 --> 02:08:42,794
Your honesty scares everyone.

1608
02:08:58,794 --> 02:08:59,994
Abbas.

1609
02:09:00,995 --> 02:09:02,395
He's dead, sir.

1610
02:09:07,274 --> 02:09:09,434
If Abbas was working for Babloo,

1611
02:09:10,675 --> 02:09:12,195
then why did Babloo kill him?

1612
02:09:16,115 --> 02:09:19,275
He didn't kill Abbas, sir.

1613
02:09:20,875 --> 02:09:22,515
Then who did?

1614
02:09:26,076 --> 02:09:28,476
I had to first find out
why Shatak died.

1615
02:09:28,875 --> 02:09:30,435
And I've found that out, sir.

1616
02:09:32,196 --> 02:09:33,915
Abbas is your riddle.

1617
02:09:35,316 --> 02:09:36,435
You solve it.

1618
02:09:50,036 --> 02:09:51,956
How could you let Vedha go?

1619
02:09:52,516 --> 02:09:54,517
You fell for his nonsense.

1620
02:09:54,916 --> 02:09:55,837
What do you think?

1621
02:09:56,197 --> 02:09:59,637
The illiterate Babloo masterminded
this whole game?

1622
02:10:00,676 --> 02:10:02,716
There's one thing I don't
understand, sir.

1623
02:10:03,076 --> 02:10:05,317
If Babloo didn't kill Abbas,

1624
02:10:05,797 --> 02:10:06,677
who did?

1625
02:10:07,317 --> 02:10:10,917
Abbas came here to meet Chanda
about the drug deal.

1626
02:10:11,597 --> 02:10:13,437
They argued about something.

1627
02:10:13,877 --> 02:10:15,277
Shots were fired from both sides.

1628
02:10:15,677 --> 02:10:17,558
Abbas died at Chanda's hands, right?

1629
02:10:18,477 --> 02:10:20,798
Maybe we're seeing things
from the wrong angle, sir.

1630
02:10:21,518 --> 02:10:24,038
The son must pay for
the father's sins.

1631
02:10:24,598 --> 02:10:26,597
Abbas was aware of his crimes.

1632
02:10:27,917 --> 02:10:30,557
He thought his son was paying
for his sins.

1633
02:10:34,398 --> 02:10:36,878
And even on that day
he couldn't shoot Shatak.

1634
02:10:38,358 --> 02:10:40,238
Because he knew Shatak
was innocent.

1635
02:10:44,638 --> 02:10:46,918
Abbas didn't come here
to meet Chanda,

1636
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:49,638
he came here to rescue her.

1637
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:54,198
To atone for his sins.

1638
02:11:08,399 --> 02:11:10,519
The Mumbai gang held Chanda.

1639
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,760
Right here.

1640
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,079
This is where she was tortured.

1641
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,800
They heard this sound.

1642
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,201
And started shooting
from over there.

1643
02:12:22,442 --> 02:12:23,362
Chanda!

1644
02:13:07,244 --> 02:13:07,964
Vikram!

1645
02:13:08,084 --> 02:13:10,883
Chanda didn't know that
Abbas had come to save her.

1646
02:13:12,124 --> 02:13:14,764
Maybe she shot him out of fear,

1647
02:13:14,884 --> 02:13:17,243
or maybe to avenge Shatak.

1648
02:13:17,483 --> 02:13:20,644
Forensics have confirmed the bullet
that killed Abbas

1649
02:13:20,924 --> 02:13:22,644
was fired from Chanda's gun.

1650
02:13:50,125 --> 02:13:53,925
<i>Blinkers cover a horse's eyes,
so it cannot see left or right.</i>

1651
02:13:55,645 --> 02:13:57,766
<i>Blinkers covered your eyes.</i>

1652
02:14:00,245 --> 02:14:04,285
<i>Abbas's son was ill.
How much was the treatment?</i>

1653
02:14:04,885 --> 02:14:06,805
<i>How did Abbas pay?
With his police salary?</i>

1654
02:14:08,806 --> 02:14:10,405
<i>The blinkers are slipping.</i>

1655
02:14:18,046 --> 02:14:22,006
Giri, you had a grand wedding
for your sister.

1656
02:14:23,606 --> 02:14:26,807
Ranjan, new bike, single payment.

1657
02:14:30,206 --> 02:14:31,286
Ansari.

1658
02:14:32,486 --> 02:14:34,967
Your son's annual school fees
are 150,000.

1659
02:14:35,966 --> 02:14:37,087
You're a good father.

1660
02:14:39,167 --> 02:14:42,127
And you two. You're good sons.

1661
02:14:42,447 --> 02:14:44,007
Martin and Anthony.

1662
02:14:45,127 --> 02:14:47,087
You paid off your father's loan.

1663
02:14:49,767 --> 02:14:51,087
Prabhakar!

1664
02:14:51,607 --> 02:14:53,527
You take 14 days casual leave,

1665
02:14:53,647 --> 02:14:56,287
but never miss visiting
the red-light district.

1666
02:14:57,207 --> 02:14:58,807
You have expensive taste.

1667
02:15:03,087 --> 02:15:04,167
Head constable.

1668
02:15:05,288 --> 02:15:06,648
You bet 200,000 on a sixer?

1669
02:15:08,608 --> 02:15:10,088
Where did you get so much cash?

1670
02:15:13,288 --> 02:15:15,888
And you, sir. Your ruins,

1671
02:15:16,008 --> 02:15:18,808
sorry, your ancestral mansion.

1672
02:15:19,729 --> 02:15:21,529
You must return it
to its former glory, sir.

1673
02:15:23,329 --> 02:15:26,569
My eyes were wide open,
but I could not see.

1674
02:15:28,969 --> 02:15:32,368
I've killed people, framed them
by planting guns on them.

1675
02:15:32,488 --> 02:15:34,369
But you forgot that the devil

1676
02:15:35,848 --> 02:15:37,369
is in the detail.

1677
02:15:39,209 --> 02:15:41,489
You placed the gun in
Chanda's right hand, sir.

1678
02:15:41,689 --> 02:15:43,209
That was a small mistake.

1679
02:15:44,249 --> 02:15:45,689
Chanda was left-handed.

1680
02:15:46,209 --> 02:15:48,530
You're a lefty, aren't you?
You eat with your left hand.

1681
02:15:48,650 --> 02:15:50,289
That's it! She's a born star.

1682
02:16:00,569 --> 02:16:02,249
We made no mistakes, Vikram.

1683
02:16:03,329 --> 02:16:05,050
We did our duty by killing them.

1684
02:16:05,170 --> 02:16:06,810
Drawing salaries from two places.

1685
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:09,450
What use is the department's
salary, Vikram?

1686
02:16:10,570 --> 02:16:12,450
Your father died in the line
of duty.

1687
02:16:13,971 --> 02:16:15,570
What did he get?

1688
02:16:17,250 --> 02:16:19,450
A medal and a bike.

1689
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:22,290
Is that what he left you?

1690
02:16:27,771 --> 02:16:29,010
It was a simple plan.

1691
02:16:30,011 --> 02:16:33,131
We'll abduct Chanda.
Shatak will come to free her.

1692
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:34,971
We'll kill Shatak.

1693
02:16:35,171 --> 02:16:37,651
Vedha will come out of hiding
to avenge Shatak's death.

1694
02:16:37,931 --> 02:16:40,611
We'll kill him and collect
our money from Babloo.

1695
02:16:44,971 --> 02:16:47,531
But suddenly Abbas developed
a conscience.

1696
02:16:50,292 --> 02:16:52,452
He decided he didn't want
to be any part of it.

1697
02:16:54,732 --> 02:16:56,692
He became a threat.

1698
02:16:57,172 --> 02:16:58,692
He would've taken us all down.

1699
02:17:21,332 --> 02:17:23,132
We had to silence him.

1700
02:17:35,173 --> 02:17:37,173
We've carried out 18 encounters, sir.

1701
02:17:38,053 --> 02:17:40,213
But I always believed justice
was on our side.

1702
02:17:42,813 --> 02:17:45,254
Where's the line that
separates us from them?

1703
02:17:45,453 --> 02:17:47,454
What's the difference
between us and them?

1704
02:17:47,853 --> 02:17:48,974
Right and wrong?

1705
02:17:49,214 --> 02:17:50,493
Police...criminal!

1706
02:17:54,374 --> 02:17:56,454
You've turned it all to dust.

1707
02:17:56,814 --> 02:17:57,654
Sir.

1708
02:17:58,694 --> 02:17:59,654
Drop your guns.

1709
02:18:00,254 --> 02:18:01,174
Drop them!

1710
02:18:01,374 --> 02:18:02,574
Drop it. Drop it.

1711
02:18:05,534 --> 02:18:06,535
Kick them away.

1712
02:18:08,695 --> 02:18:09,614
And move back.

1713
02:18:09,974 --> 02:18:10,735
Anthony.

1714
02:18:11,174 --> 02:18:12,134
Back.

1715
02:18:14,535 --> 02:18:15,375
Sir.

1716
02:18:15,495 --> 02:18:16,815
Deepak, give me cover.

1717
02:18:17,014 --> 02:18:17,935
Sir.

1718
02:18:19,815 --> 02:18:21,615
- Deepak, cover me.
- Yes, sir.

1719
02:18:21,735 --> 02:18:22,615
Move back.

1720
02:18:23,495 --> 02:18:24,295
Deepak...

1721
02:18:30,575 --> 02:18:31,496
Move back!

1722
02:18:36,656 --> 02:18:38,456
Pick up your guns.
Don't let him escape.

1723
02:18:40,696 --> 02:18:41,735
Seal all the exits.

1724
02:18:41,855 --> 02:18:43,055
Go, go, go!

1725
02:19:15,297 --> 02:19:17,137
Bloody hell! He doesn't have a gun.

1726
02:20:00,218 --> 02:20:01,259
Don't kill them!

1727
02:21:45,342 --> 02:21:46,662
Let's kill this one, sir.

1728
02:21:49,863 --> 02:21:51,462
Sir, I haven't done anything.

1729
02:21:51,903 --> 02:21:53,943
- I was only following orders.
- You're not a full-fledged cop yet,

1730
02:21:54,942 --> 02:21:56,343
but already a criminal.

1731
02:23:32,346 --> 02:23:35,146
It's tough killing your colleagues,
isn't it?

1732
02:23:38,546 --> 02:23:39,826
Trigger or finger.

1733
02:23:40,586 --> 02:23:41,866
I have no doubts, sir.

1734
02:24:08,627 --> 02:24:10,067
You killed the IG, sir.

1735
02:24:11,708 --> 02:24:12,868
That's serious.

1736
02:24:14,228 --> 02:24:15,628
I know a lawyer.

1737
02:24:16,307 --> 02:24:19,067
Priya madam. Shall I give you
her number?

1738
02:24:19,468 --> 02:24:20,828
She'll never defend me.

1739
02:24:21,068 --> 02:24:22,548
I'll put in a good word.

1740
02:24:24,948 --> 02:24:26,108
Love marriage?

1741
02:24:28,468 --> 02:24:30,748
One often faces such problems
in love marriages, sir.

1742
02:24:31,708 --> 02:24:33,148
I have a solution.

1743
02:24:34,348 --> 02:24:35,988
My own love story.

1744
02:24:37,468 --> 02:24:39,269
- Do you want to hear it?
- Enough!

1745
02:24:40,349 --> 02:24:41,709
No more stories.

1746
02:24:41,988 --> 02:24:43,068
Sure?

1747
02:24:50,349 --> 02:24:52,029
Look at these two, Vikram sir.

1748
02:24:52,669 --> 02:24:54,469
They could never be honest.

1749
02:24:56,749 --> 02:24:59,350
Not to their own people.
Or to their profession.

1750
02:25:00,469 --> 02:25:03,109
All their lives they've chased
greed and illusions.

1751
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:05,389
People forget.

1752
02:25:05,749 --> 02:25:07,390
You're born empty-handed,
you die empty-handed.

1753
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:09,750
Born from the earth.
Only to go back into the earth.

1754
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:13,549
Lying there like cockroaches.

1755
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:18,270
What did I gain, sir?

1756
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:21,990
Balls!

1757
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:25,830
Life is a joke, sir.

1758
02:25:30,510 --> 02:25:31,430
Yes!

1759
02:25:32,510 --> 02:25:33,271
Police.

1760
02:25:33,950 --> 02:25:36,191
Vedha sir, now you tell me,

1761
02:25:36,710 --> 02:25:37,831
what should Vikram do?

1762
02:25:39,311 --> 02:25:40,711
Should he let Vedha go?

1763
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:43,991
Spare Vedha because he saved his life
and fought alongside him?

1764
02:25:46,071 --> 02:25:47,551
Or should he kill Vedha?

1765
02:25:48,071 --> 02:25:51,111
Because Vedha is a criminal
who has murdered 16 men.

1766
02:25:52,272 --> 02:25:53,791
Another dilemma.

1767
02:25:55,551 --> 02:25:56,751
What should Vikram do?
