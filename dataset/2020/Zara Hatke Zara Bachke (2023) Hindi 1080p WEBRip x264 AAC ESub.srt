1
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,440
'Everyone in this country,
dreams of having,'

2
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,920
'a little place to call home,'

3
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,880
'where they'll make
the best memories of their lives,'

4
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
'and make it their divine abode.'

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
'We too have the same dream.'

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
'Today's our second anniversary,'

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,120
'and to celebrate we're
visiting our dream home. Rather,'

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,480
'We're just living in the moment,'

9
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,120
'and we need your blessings.'

10
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,240
"Look, I've seen a dream."

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,440
"Our home is in a
valley of flowers."

12
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
"What a nice weather it is."

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
"Where are you?"

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,160
- "I'm coming, coming, coming, coming.
- Do come."

15
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,400
"So beautiful is this dream."

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,480
"Our home is in
a valley of flowers."

17
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,040
"What a nice weather it is."

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,800
"Where are you?"

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,160
- "I'm coming, coming, coming, coming.
- Do come."

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,720
- Happy birthday to you!
- Hey, not birthday

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,400
it's their anniversary.
You are too much!

22
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,040
Technically,
it's their wedding birthday.

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
Come on, get on with it.

24
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,880
- Happy anniversary...
- ...to you!

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,440
Cut it up and share
it with everyone.

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,400
- Cut big pieces, too.
- Fine.

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,520
- That's not fair, Mehjabeen.
- It has been two years.

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Can I have some more cake?

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
It's delicious!

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,880
What flavour is it?

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,040
Tooti-Fruti, Mom.

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,840
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,280
Who cares about the flavor!
It's cake, enjoy it!

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
- Eat some more!
- Sure.

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
It's just okay, Sister-in-law.

36
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,480
Give me the slice
with the cherry on top!

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,440
- Give it to her.
- Give it here.

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,680
For you.

39
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,440
Thanks!

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,560
Happy wedding anniversary
to the cutest couple in Indore!

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
This girl remembers everything
about Kapil.

42
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,800
She's been like that
since they were kids.

43
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,240
- Really?
- How could she forget, Uncle?

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,680
She's our best friend.

45
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Kapil's and now mine.

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
Hello! Hello!

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,320
Myself Manoj Bhagel B-A-L-L-B - RRB.

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
The best damn divorce
lawyer in Indore.

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Is your husband being a jerk?

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Is your wife ruining your life?

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
Call Manoj.

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,000
Call today, divorce tomorrow.

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,840
Kapil...

54
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Hmm?

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
Isn't it good?

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Since when did you
start eating eggs, huh?

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,960
- Eggs? No!
- Eggs?

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,280
- No!
- Don't lie!

59
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,760
I am not lying, Mom.

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
- See for yourself. It contains eggs.
- He is a kid.

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
He just blabbers.

62
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,280
Brother-in-law!

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,640
They tricked us into eating eggs

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
and hurt our religious feelings!

65
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,960
Who does that?

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,200
God help me!

67
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,440
Brother-in-law,

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
now we have to purify ourselves
with Holy Ganges water.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,360
Sajjan drank it all yesterday.

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,200
You have cow's urine at home,
don't you?

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,280
Now don't say that
Sajjan drank that as well.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,480
Mom, I swear I had
ordered an eggless cake.

73
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course, you had!

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
Don't lie, girl.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,840
Don't even bother.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
It has the red dot

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,760
and even I know what that means.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,960
- Come on, Kapil, you should have checked!
- Aunt.

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,800
Trust me,
Dad, we ordered an eggless cake.

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,000
- We couldn't park the bike so...
- Shut up.

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,560
Oh God, she must've fed you
all kinds of meat by now.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,320
Why are you exaggerating, Mom?

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,480
I accept it's my fault, Mom.

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,400
Let bygones be bygones now.

85
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,400
Don't eat the cake.

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,960
- We'll order another cake.
- Dear.

87
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,040
You Punjabis are all the same!

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,480
That's not true, Aunty.

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,960
You guys are so forward!

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,640
I'm sure your mother loves to drink
with your father.

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,720
So now we too should start drinking
with the sun comes up?

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,120
- What are you saying, Aunty?
- Calm down.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
Just calm down.
Sit with me.

94
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
- Why stop there?
- Somya...

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,080
Go on and say that
Punjabi girls are crafty.

96
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,360
- When did I say that?
- Sister?

97
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,120
By the way, we start drinking only
after the sun goes down.

98
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
Somya, Somya...

99
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,520
They have a problem
with everything I do!

100
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,280
That's not true.

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
Mom didn't like me teaching
at the coaching center.

102
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,600
And you... you have been causing trouble
since the moment you came here.

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,240
Your snarky comments never stop.

104
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,560
What's your problem?

105
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,920
Kapil and I gave you our room

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
- when you lost your house.
- Somya... stop.

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,120
"Aunty's back hurts,
let her sleep on the bed."

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
It's been six months

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,040
and we've been sleeping
in the living room,

110
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,520
but I never complained.

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,640
You guys always like to
make a big deal out of nothing.

112
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
- Go on!
- It's not so, Somya.

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,640
- Don't, Kapil.
- Listen...

114
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,120
You did us a huge favor
by giving us your room!

115
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Come here, let me felicitate you.

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
Stop it, Aunty.

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,760
- Come here.
- Don't bother, Kapil.

118
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
We came here in a time of
need thinking you are our family.

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,320
Hey but...

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Sister, you should have told
us if Somya had a problem with it.

121
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
The cake is all yours.

122
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,960
- No one else will eat it.
- Of course.

123
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll just throw it away.

124
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560
Stop it!

125
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,800
I have an early class tomorrow.

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,920
Why are you mad at me?

127
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,160
Uncle's family has been
crashing here for six months

128
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
and we don't have our own room,

129
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,320
so there's no privacy.

130
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,200
To top it off,
they've been dissing my parents.

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,480
But they needed a place to stay,
so what else could we do?

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,120
You know how Aunty's nature is.

133
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,240
She's got no filter on her.

134
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
She'll act like nothing
happened in the morning.

135
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,360
Hey, don't cry like that or this 5-star
chocolate will be pissed at you.

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,040
- Kapil...
- Hmm?

137
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,920
Kapil, you always
think things through.

138
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,360
Hmm?

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
Tell me straight up,

140
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,600
are we gonna get our
own house in the future?

141
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
In the future?

142
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,160
It's as good as done, girl.

143
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,440
We've already scouted out the place.

144
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,360
Hmm.

145
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,680
We'll chat with Mr. Rastogi
to seal the deal tomorrow.

146
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,800
Mrs. Somya, you're gonna have your
own keys to your new house soon enough.

147
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,840
Happy anniversary.

148
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,480
Happy second anniversary!

149
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
Hey Sajjan, what's going on?

150
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,480
Can't sleep.

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
What are you searching
for in the fridge?

152
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
Can't sleep.

153
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,640
And what does it have
to do with the fridge?

154
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,480
I said I can't sleep.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
We may not own the place,

156
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,520
but we still pay for
the electricity bill,

157
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,280
so close the fridge and come here.

158
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,080
Sale! Sale!

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,720
Look Somya,
there's a big sale on shoes.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,360
Kapu, we are going to buy a house.

161
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,400
Please don't act cheap over there.

162
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,040
These high-class societies
have a certain standard.

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
So now, I'll have to borrow
manners to talk like the rich?

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,840
Stop it, Kapu!

165
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,000
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- What is it?

166
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Let's buy a nameplate.

167
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,360
Hold on, let's buy the house first.

168
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,000
We're already here,
why not just get it now?

169
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
We won't need to
search for it later.

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
- Come with me.
- Somya...

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,400
- Let's go.
- But Somya...

172
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,440
Let's go!

173
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
How much for this one?

174
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,000
2200.

175
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
2200!

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,280
That's crazy! I could get a better
one at Anand Bazaar for just 200.

177
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
And this one?

178
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
3800.

179
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,200
Did you use blood instead
of ink for that one?

180
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,880
I know I could get
it for 350 at Siyaganj.

181
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,280
Kapu...

182
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,280
What about this one?

183
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,520
It's classy, right?

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
It's for 5000!

185
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,000
- We could get a better deal at--
- Ma'am,

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
you only buy a house
once in your life.

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
You should finalize it.

188
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,000
If he could,
he'd put a CNG kit in Mercedes.

189
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
Like you have ever
ridden a Mercedes.

190
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
- Finalize it.
- Wait, what?

191
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
- Somya, let's reconsider.
- What name do you want on it?

192
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,360
Kapil Dubey, Somya Dubey.

193
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,840
Somya Chawla Dubey.

194
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
Welcome to Devdutt Builders.

195
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
No, thank you.

196
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
Come on, take it. It's free.

197
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,720
Thank you.

198
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,960
Take it.

199
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
Remember what I said, Kapu?

200
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,760
Hmm?

201
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,920
It's fresh.

202
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,200
- You done?
- Yep. It was delicious.

203
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
- Mr. Dubey!
- Mr. Rastogi!

204
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,040
- How are you?
- How are you?

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
- I'm good.
- Hey!

206
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,840
Did you check out the place?

207
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,360
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah!

208
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,040
Did you like it?

209
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,840
We loved it!

210
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,960
That's awesome to hear.

211
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,680
Everything looks good
with the documents, Mr. Dubey.

212
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,880
Great.

213
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,520
Now we just need to go to
the Royal Bank and apply for a loan.

214
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
- Okay.
- Sure thing.

215
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm sure the bank will offer easy
payment options for the 5.5 million loan.

216
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,680
We don't want you guys
to be burdened by it.

217
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
5.5 million?

218
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,080
Yes.

219
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Wait, didn't the Radio Ad say it

220
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,400
- was worth 3.5 million?
- Exactly.

221
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,520
You don't get it.

222
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,160
You chose a deluxe
flat worth 4.5 million

223
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,000
that includes a gym, club,
and parking space.

224
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,840
You'll need to pay for those too.

225
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
- Parking?!
- Yes.

226
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,920
- But we don't even own a car.
- Right.

227
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,360
He's a yoga instructor,
so we won't need the gym either.

228
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,120
And we aren't really
the clubbing type, so...

229
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,920
Ma'am, do you plan on riding
on the back of a scooter forever?

230
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,360
Don't worry about the amount,

231
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
I'll make sure the bank
gives you easy payment options.

232
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,480
Easy payment options?

233
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,720
Who is gonna pay
double installments?!

234
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,960
Mr. Dubey, I think, this
house is a bit over your budget.

235
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,040
Maybe I need to teach
you the Cobra Stretch.

236
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,840
It's the only way you'll get rid
of that twitchy arrogance.

237
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Hey, don't talk like that!

238
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,600
The starting range of
this site is 4.5 million.

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,240
You see Mr. Rastogi,
we've already ordered a nameplate,

240
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
so we'll have a house
in the main city.

241
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,440
Save my number,

242
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,080
I'll invite you to the housewarming
party. Make sure you do come!

243
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,280
Alright, let's go, Kapu.

244
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,600
- His Chi is misaligned.
- Chi?

245
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,400
Yes.

246
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,680
Hey man, can I get soda and glass?

247
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,600
And throw in a straw too.

248
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
Thanks a lot.

249
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
This city is full of crazy.

250
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,280
We went out to buy a house and
it made us realize where we stand.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,560
Don't be stupid.

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,880
Who are these no-good people
to tell us our place?

253
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,120
No need to stress,
we'll figure it out.

254
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,080
- You promise?
- Promise.

255
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,840
Crazy girl.

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,320
Cheers.

257
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,720
So, the formula is MgO...

258
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
Summit...

259
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,280
Stand up.

260
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,640
I said stand up!

261
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,440
Neeraj.

262
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Read what formula
he wrote in his book.

263
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,840
My heart, my soul, you make me whole

264
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,080
but you also smell like a troll
so grab a shower when you get home!

265
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Silence!

266
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,920
Do you seriously think any girl
is going to dig you for your punky face?

267
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Trim this crazy mane!

268
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,120
Maybe then, your brain will get
enough oxygen to understand something.

269
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
Silence, I say!

270
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,560
Thank you, Aunty!
Congratulations!

271
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,520
Here dear, grab one.

272
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
Did you have another
grandchild, Aunty?

273
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,080
Tell your son to control himself.

274
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,960
Has he ever heard
of family planning?

275
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,560
No ma'am, I didn't become a grandma.

276
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,080
I won a house through the scheme.

277
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,320
What scheme?

278
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,280
The Government Housing Scheme.

279
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,640
My husband had applied for it.

280
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,000
- Can I have a look at it?
- Here you go.

281
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,840
Public Housing Scheme.

282
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,320
Congratulations, Aunty.

283
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,240
I'll take one.

284
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,880
- Sure. Go for it.
- Thank you.

285
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Okay.

286
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Good afternoon.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,080
Hey, Mrs. Somya!

288
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,480
You in a rush?

289
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,680
Hey, Dimpy Sir.

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,760
Just heading home.

291
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,480
Make sure you leave
some time for yourself.

292
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,720
You know one of our students has opened
a big, fancy coffee shop on M.G. Road?

293
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,720
- Hmm?
- Yes.

294
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,880
Obviously,
I am going to inaugurate it.

295
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,400
You should join me.

296
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I'd really like that.

297
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
You should get your
mom to find you a wife

298
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,240
who can make tea,

299
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,840
or you'll be stuck going
to coffee shops your whole life.

300
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Hmm?

301
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,800
Okay? Bye.

302
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,880
You know the old lady who
works at the coaching center?

303
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,320
She's getting a new
house through a scheme.

304
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,560
- Really?
- Check this out.

305
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,640
Public Housing Scheme.

306
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,760
That could solve
our housing problems.

307
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,320
So, should we give
up on finding a place

308
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,360
and deal with government
bureaucracy instead?

309
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,840
Maybe we should just rent for now.

310
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,920
How long do you plan on renting for?

311
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,880
Two or three years?

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,840
Do you think Uncle
and Aunty will ever leave?

313
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,800
What about our future children
when we decide to have them?

314
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,280
- What about them?
- What about them?

315
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,000
Where will they sleep? In the yard?

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,640
Somya, let's just drop
the idea of buying a house.

317
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
We already have a nice house.

318
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,120
Let's just add two
new rooms on the terrace.

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,280
We'll save on rent,
and stay with our family.

320
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,760
You're always thinking small.

321
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,600
Come on, Kapil!
I just want to leave this area

322
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,680
and get our kids
into a better school.

323
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,160
Yesterday you wanted
to buy a 5.5 million flat,

324
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,840
and today you want to
try for the government scheme.

325
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,880
One moment you are
talking about privacy,

326
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,800
and the next you're talking
about the future of our children.

327
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,080
We need some clarity before
we take such a big decision.

328
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,000
Will you go to the Public
Housing Office or should I?

329
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
It's a government scheme,

330
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
but we'll still need
to get a bank loan for it.

331
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,440
We'll also have
to grease many palms.

332
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,240
It comes with many
strings attached, Somya.

333
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,680
It's very tough these days.

334
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
You can't even look
at me in our own house.

335
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Sajjan has been sleeping
with us for the past three months!

336
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,800
We have to go to a
lodge for some alone time.

337
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,000
That's our reality, Mr. Dubey.

338
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,480
Do you understand,
or should I continue?

339
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,720
I get it.

340
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,800
What?

341
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,200
Put it on the table and leave.

342
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,600
Fine, I'll go there.

343
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,960
You should try doing
the Headstand Pose,

344
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,240
or your brain might explode someday.

345
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,200
Kapil, shall we go?

346
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,520
Yeah, let's head out.

347
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,480
You didn't finish the soda?

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,080
Do you have a permanent house?

349
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,200
Yes, sir, but it belongs to my dad.

350
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,520
And it's small.

351
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
It's tiny.

352
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,880
Size doesn't matter.

353
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,000
Public Housing Scheme is a government
thing that gets you in a permanent house,

354
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,800
but only if you fit their criteria.

355
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,640
Okay, and how do I check
off those criteria boxes?

356
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,800
You can't. Only the right
people are born into it.

357
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,840
Well, I was born
in the wrong category.

358
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,400
So, how do I go about it?

359
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,880
Stand up.

360
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,880
You can try again in your next life.

361
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,760
I'll be here, at your service.

362
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,520
But seriously, it's tiny...

363
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,560
Just follow my lead
and you'll get there.

364
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,280
- Fine.
- Give it here.

365
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,440
Here you go.

366
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
Listen.

367
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,800
You have the number, right?

368
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,880
Hit me with a missed call.

369
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,000
Later, man.

370
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Hey, dude!

371
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,560
You seem like you know
how to get stuff done.

372
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,320
Tell me about that
Public Housing Scheme.

373
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,480
What's wrong?

374
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,400
You weren't born
into the right category.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,920
You guessed that right.

376
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,520
My dad had no idea
I'd need this someday.

377
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,040
I apologize on his behalf.

378
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,760
You are lucky.

379
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,560
You have come to the right guy.

380
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,800
The darkest night comes
before the brightest day.

381
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,520
Be here after sundown.

382
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
And no haggling.

383
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,600
Hmm?

384
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,880
Time to fly away.

385
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,760
Hit me with a missed call.

386
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,760
Come on, Kapu, why do you
never fill the tank all the way up?

387
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,240
Gasoline likes to evaporate.

388
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,080
Forget that, will our family
be cool with you coming with me?

389
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,520
I don't care. I don't give a damn.

390
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,640
Get it?

391
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
How do I thank you?

392
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,240
With cash, preferably.

393
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,000
You're a lifesaver.

394
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,120
It's nothing, ma'am.

395
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,120
Just pay the cash
and I'll handle the rest.

396
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,600
Okay?
Hit me with a missed call.

397
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,600
Hey, dude!

398
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,720
Met you in the morning...

399
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,240
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Let's go.

400
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Come on in.

401
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,280
You wait there.
I'll be with you in a minute.

402
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,760
- Come on in.
- Let's go.

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,120
Flat is ahead.

404
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,520
Your place is hard to find.

405
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,480
You got to work hard to
get where you want to be, man.

406
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,920
Come on in.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,240
Be seated.

408
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,080
"Feel nice to meet me."

409
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,000
Bhagwandas Iswardas Sahai.

410
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
This is dope, buddy.

411
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,880
So you are an agent as well?

412
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,120
Don't insult me by
calling me an agent.

413
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm here to do public service, 24/7.

414
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,920
I listen to people's
problems in the morning,

415
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,680
and come up with
solutions in the evening.

416
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,960
So, how can I help you?

417
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,760
I am Kapil Dubey.
This is my wife, Somya Dubey.

418
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,840
Somya Chawla Dubey.

419
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,480
Somya Chawla Dubey.

420
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,080
You dig it?

421
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,960
Good job.

422
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,160
Can we move on now
from the name game?

423
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,840
Hey man, break down that
Public Housing Scheme math for me.

424
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,800
You got to understand
the science behind it first.

425
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,720
There are two types
of people in this world.

426
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,040
The haves and the have-nots.

427
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,760
Those who have stuff
and those who don't.

428
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,960
So what do they not have?

429
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,240
Let's say a house, for example!

430
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,680
Who doesn't have a house?

431
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,120
Those who don't have the cash,

432
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,120
like laborers, wage earners, guards,

433
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,360
and rickshaw pullers,
cart pullers, and so on.

434
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,960
So the government comes through
with schemes for those people.

435
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,080
They get a cheap house in
a prime location that they can own.

436
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,320
It's so tempting that even
middle-class peeps go for it.

437
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Ladies get first priority.

438
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,160
And most importantly, you
can't have your own permanent house.

439
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,120
We have one,
but it belongs to his dad.

440
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,160
It's small.

441
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,080
Small? It's tiny.

442
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
Are you sure it's made
not of mud or some organic crap?

443
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,880
Yeah, we're sure.

444
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,520
Then you don't have the eligibility.

445
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,440
But there's got
to be a way around it.

446
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,240
There are two options,
easy or tough.

447
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,440
First: Your dad disowns you.

448
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
What?

449
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,720
That's not going to happen.

450
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
So, what's the easy way?

451
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,560
He wants Dad to disown me.

452
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,240
You disown your wife.

453
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,680
Meaning?

454
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
Wives have property rights,

455
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:32,920
so if she isn't your wife she won't
have a house, a shop, or anything

456
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,960
which makes her eligible.

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Then the house is yours.

458
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,760
So Mr. Dubey and Mrs. Choli...
Sorry, Mrs. Chawla...

459
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,840
This is how you can take
advantage of this scheme.

460
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,120
What have you been smoking, man?

461
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,000
What are you saying?

462
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,960
- What is he suggesting, huh?
- Hold on, dude.

463
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,360
You have to divorce
but you do not have to split.

464
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,440
A piece of paper doesn't
end a relationship.

465
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,400
We go step by step

466
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Get a legal divorce,

467
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,560
get a house,

468
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,400
then get married again.

469
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,680
Everything is back to normal.

470
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,200
It'll be like a deleted
folder in your life

471
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,200
and no one will be none the wiser.

472
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
- You're such a crazy!
- Kapil!

473
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
We came here looking for a house and
you want us to break our marriage?

474
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm right.

475
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,240
If you want the house,
pony up and make the decision.

476
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,800
What's there to decide?

477
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,120
He calls himself a public servant!

478
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,240
Let's go, Somya.

479
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
We are done here. Let's go.

480
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,920
Write it down, kid.

481
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,200
Give me half portion of chili chicken.

482
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,240
Half a portion of Manchurian, too.

483
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,200
Noodles,
a full portion but split in half.

484
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
What will you add to the
one-half portion of the noodles?

485
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,640
Chicken.

486
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Right.

487
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,240
A soda, spilt into two.
Okay?

488
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,640
- Hurry it up.
- Hold on.

489
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
I'll have a separate soda.

490
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,720
Hey, wait, just get one.

491
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,120
I got gas.

492
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,680
Now scram.

493
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
What?

494
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,760
You know why I liked
you before marriage?

495
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,600
Why?

496
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
You weren't like those
other no-good guys.

497
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,120
You were realistic.

498
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,880
You knew how to be happy,

499
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,720
and how to keep others
happy without spending too much.

500
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,840
You didn't ask too much from life.

501
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,360
You always knew where to draw the line.

502
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,600
And the best thing about you -

503
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,280
you didn't change after we got married.

504
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,440
You never forget to bring me a
5-star chocolate every day since we met.

505
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,960
That was an incredible day.

506
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,520
11th June, Wednesday.

507
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,840
You were wearing a beautiful
white dress with flowers on it.

508
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,720
And those Jaipuri sandals!

509
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,480
You looked amazing.

510
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,120
What was that you had
said while sipping on soda?

511
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,920
"Hey Kapil,
give me a lesson on saving money!"

512
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,200
"Please!"

513
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,440
I had no clue in the beginning,

514
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,280
but by the end of the day,
I knew I got a girl impressed.

515
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Oh, Kapu...

516
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,600
Oh, Somya...

517
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,280
Let's hurry up with
our food order, okay?

518
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,360
- Check that out.
- What?

519
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,320
Idli Fry - 80

520
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,080
Mysore Masala Dosa - 90

521
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,800
Paneer Uttappam - 120

522
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,720
He's got to be making
200K-300K a month.

523
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,560
Looking a little higher won't
make the clouds burst, you know?

524
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,080
Oh.

525
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,600
Kapil, you never see
what you're supposed to.

526
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,560
Higher? Where?

527
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,480
That bird's nest?

528
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,240
I'll get it removed.

529
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,600
- Yo kid!
- Kapil!

530
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,200
That's someone's home.

531
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,720
Somya, please don't play
the emotional card on me.

532
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,440
We finally got a chance
to get out of the house.

533
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
Look, thing happens
when they're supposed to happen.

534
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,160
So wake up, it's time!

535
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,880
Time to do what?

536
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,280
Get a divorce.

537
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
What?

538
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
You go, we'll figure this out.

539
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
Divorce?

540
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
I already talked to Manoj.

541
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,480
It'll be done in ten days.

542
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,160
What?

543
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,720
What do you want, Somya?

544
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,520
A house we can call our own.

545
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,840
Our home!

546
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,160
So we should get
a divorce just for that?

547
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
63% of women in this country
don't own a house of their own,

548
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,160
but you don't care.

549
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,200
Nevermind about me,

550
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,960
our family will flip if we tell them.

551
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,840
- Do we have to tell them?
- Divorce...

552
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,640
Do we have to get a divorce?

553
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
Come on, Kapil!

554
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,680
It's not like we're breaking up.

555
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,120
It's just a paper.

556
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
Why the...

557
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,760
Why the hell are you so
afraid to divorce me on paper?

558
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,600
You're crazy, Somya.

559
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,520
You never think big!

560
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,680
But...

561
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,320
Somya, at least eat the noodles.

562
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,240
I asked him to add chicken just for you.

563
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,360
I hate street noodles.

564
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,960
It messes with my stomach.

565
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,480
Did I ever tell you that?

566
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
Come on, girl! Somya...

567
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,080
Yo, kid! Come here.

568
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
- Pack up the vegetarian stuff.
- Alright.

569
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,520
Hey, bro, you left a buck last time.

570
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,320
That's your tip. Enjoy.

571
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,720
No, bro, I don't need it.
You take it.

572
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
- You sure?
- Yeah, man, positive.

573
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Get the parcel and meet me near my bike.

574
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,960
Yes.

575
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,240
Now where did she go?

576
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,880
Somya!

577
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,480
You, your mom, your whole family,
you all are cheap as hell!

578
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,040
Total scrooges!

579
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
You probably got lice
crawling all over you!

580
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,120
- There he is!
- Good for nothing bum! Move.

581
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Yeah, I'm cheap, but at least
I'm not a conniving cheater like you!

582
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,640
She's got her ex's name tattooed
on her heart right here.

583
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,240
Sunny, you're my bunny!

584
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,840
Councilor,
he isn't an ex, he's a double ex.

585
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
If the double ex didn't have
a problem with the "Sunny's Bunny",

586
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,320
why's he so jealous?

587
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,760
Enough!
ENOUGH!

588
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,440
Kapu, what's happening here?

589
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,400
I think they sell clothes.

590
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,440
That's enough, now don't
go on telling me how much they make.

591
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,600
Somya...

592
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,040
Sister, please.

593
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,080
Go away!
Buzz off!

594
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
Beat it!

595
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,360
What are you doing?

596
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Hello.

597
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,160
Brother Manoj, what was that all about?

598
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
It's an everyday thing for us.

599
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,800
People these days just
need a small excuse to part ways.

600
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,280
I don't feel good today.

601
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,080
You don't feel good?

602
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,240
Sit down, I'll get you some water.

603
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,000
- No... - Yes, please.
- Sit down, bro.

604
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,440
Who in their right mind would feel
good after hearing that crap all day?

605
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,960
Hey, I'm not feeling too
good about your divorce thing.

606
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,720
Move!

607
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,400
What can I say, bro?

608
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,680
It took a lot of convincing
to get me on board.

609
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,120
I'm happy as it makes Somya happy.

610
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
So just help us get
this over with cordially.

611
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,040
You can do that, can't you?

612
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,880
What?

613
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,080
You can do that, right?

614
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,360
Don't worry.

615
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,880
Your friend here is the
best divorce lawyer in town.

616
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,080
Which friend?

617
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,760
I am talking about myself!

618
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,600
Fine.

619
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:28,040
"Oh, my love, for you alone,"

620
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:39,080
"I'd trade the world,
without a moan."

621
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:44,000
"With you by my side, I have it all"

622
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,520
"With you by my side, I have it all"

623
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,280
"No need for help, no blessings to call"

624
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,480
"With you by my side, I have it all"

625
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,000
"Listen up, girl,"

626
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,760
"My true love,"

627
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:16,120
"Forever and now
I'll always want you, I vow"

628
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,920
"With you by my side, I have it all"

629
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,120
"With you by my side, I have it all"

630
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,000
"No need for help, no blessings to call"

631
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,960
"With you by my side, I have it all"

632
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,400
"You're the one, You're the one,"

633
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,040
"My love, You're the one,"

634
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,240
"You're mine and I'm yours."

635
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:13,040
"My sun rises"

636
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,240
"When you wake up."

637
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:31,680
"My sun doesn't rise without you"

638
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,200
"Dreams are pale, for you are the truth"

639
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,120
"Listen up, girl,"

640
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,360
"My true love,"

641
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:57,360
"My wounds need no treatment,
your touch cures it all"

642
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,240
"With you by my side, I have it all"

643
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,640
"With you by my side, I have it all"

644
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,480
"No need for help, no blessings to call"

645
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,760
"With you by my side, I have it all"

646
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,400
"You are the one for me,"

647
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,560
"You are the one for me,"

648
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,720
"You are the one for me,"

649
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,920
"My love, you are the one for me,"

650
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
"You are the one for me,"

651
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,960
"Without you, my love,"

652
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:43,400
"I don't want this world either."

653
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,840
Take it easy, girl.

654
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,000
Don't jump over my legs,
I won't get any taller.

655
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,520
How much taller you want to be, huh?

656
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,240
Be careful.

657
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
Puru, what's wrong with Deepa?

658
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,120
Nothing, Sister.

659
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,680
- We went to the Kahjrana Ganesh Temple.
- Okay.

660
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,480
- You know it's a steep climb.
- Yeah.

661
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,160
So she's out of breath.

662
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
- You good?
- Yeah.

663
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,360
What are you looking at?

664
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Give it here.

665
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,360
You never do your homework!

666
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,280
Can't read a damn thing.

667
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,880
- You good?
- Hmm.

668
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,720
What's wrong?

669
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,200
Your blood sugar
levels dropped suddenly?

670
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,240
He used to do that, stand
like a statue even when he was a kid.

671
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,160
Sister... these are divorce papers.

672
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,640
- God bless you, dear.
- Pandit, really? Have you lost your mind?

673
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,920
I was just 15 when I married you.

674
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,320
You want to divorce me at this age?

675
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,040
You should've divorced me
while I was still young enough!

676
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,000
He isn't lucky enough to
find another wife at this age.

677
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
These divorce papers
are Kapil's and Somya's.

678
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,920
Come here, Brother-in-law.

679
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
- Kapu...
- Hmm?

680
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,760
You're losing hair.

681
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,320
Easy there, girl.
I don't want to go bald.

682
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
Easy.

683
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,440
- Kapil...
- Hmm?

684
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,440
Why are they staring at us?

685
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
What kind of a joke is this, son?

686
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,200
Divorce?

687
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,520
Speak up!

688
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,800
What are they going to say,
Brother-in-law?

689
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,600
Their silence speaks volumes!
Look at them!

690
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Kapil!

691
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,280
You done with breakfast?

692
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,600
It's all because of these
unlucky friends of his.

693
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,280
He made them get divorced.

694
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,360
Coming, Mom!

695
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,040
He always runs to her
when hits the fan.

696
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,160
You two are smart. What's the deal?

697
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Brother-in-law,

698
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm sure this Punjabi girl is to blame.

699
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,000
She wears backless blouses
and saris' below the navel.

700
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,600
She dresses up like that and goes out.

701
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,840
Their marriage was bound to break.

702
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,160
I haven't even seen my grandson yet!

703
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,400
Me neither.

704
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,800
Daughter-in-law, say that it's a lie.

705
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,640
It's true, Mom.

706
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240
And it isn't your fault.

707
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,760
It's between us.

708
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,600
I don't want to stay with him anymore.

709
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
He's made my life a living hell!

710
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,240
He's always thinking in one direction!

711
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,480
What a crazy!

712
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,360
Oh!

713
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,840
Forget that,
Somya tell me, how'd it get this bad?

714
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,160
Wait, Uncle.

715
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,760
You are no movie star either!

716
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,880
I just pity you sometimes
and take care of your needs.

717
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,840
Hey! All I got to do
is let my hair down in the market

718
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,200
and men like you come crawling!

719
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm sick of pretending!

720
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,520
It's do or die now.

721
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,240
But what is the issue, though?

722
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,360
Ask him, go on and ask him.

723
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,440
He goes out with girls
under the guise of teaching yoga.

724
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,880
He's always lying.

725
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,640
Like you always tell the truth!

726
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,400
His Chi is messed up!

727
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,560
Chi? What's that?

728
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Uncle, Chi is an energy vibration.

729
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
When we do Bellows Breaths in yoga...

730
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,320
He's jealous because
I make more than him!

731
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,920
It bruised his ego for good.

732
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
Hear that!

733
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,440
She's talking ego!

734
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
First, learn to
appreciate what you have.

735
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,920
You're taunting me about money?

736
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,080
It's not like
she's making millions, Aunty.

737
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,880
Right.

738
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,360
I've got a regular income. I'm stable.

739
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,880
This man is jealous!

740
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,080
Good thing you all found out.

741
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,320
We don't have to pretend anymore!

742
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,440
Pretend!

743
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,520
She's getting uppity
because of an incentive!

744
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,320
I told her to tell everyone
so we could bury this.

745
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,720
But she refused!

746
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,760
"Kapu, let's keep it under wraps."

747
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
Tell me, can anyone keep
something like this a secret?

748
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,560
Right!

749
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,760
He's a idiot!

750
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,360
He only gets one soda at a time!

751
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
He smells and snores like hell!

752
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
Do you even know how
to tie your own pajamas?

753
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,400
Watch your tongue or else...
I'll do something bad!

754
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,640
Kapil!

755
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,520
I'm waiting for the court date.

756
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
I've had it!

757
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,520
This was bound to happen.

758
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,360
They won't be getting
the 5-star chocolate anymore?

759
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,920
Their stars are misaligned and you're
worried about the 5-star chocolate?

760
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,280
Son, even though marriages
are made in heaven,

761
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,800
it's our job to stay committed to them.

762
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,480
Mistakes happen,

763
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,480
but that doesn't mean you get divorced.

764
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
Exactly.

765
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,920
I was 12 years younger than
your father when I married him.

766
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,040
I used to look like Meryl Streep.

767
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,280
Whenever we used to step
outside the house together,

768
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,520
people thought I was his daughter.

769
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,200
But I stayed with him, didn't I?

770
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Right?

771
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,760
Yes.

772
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,800
So, what is the issue here?

773
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,440
Tell me the truth,
are you having an affair?

774
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Is she?

775
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,760
Come on, Mom!

776
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,320
No one's having an affair!

777
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,240
Do you really think
Somya's that kind of girl?

778
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,360
What I think doesn't matter, son.

779
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Hey...

780
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,200
Come on, Mom!

781
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,120
Dang girl, you can act!

782
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,360
I was the best actress
in my class.

783
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,360
Why were you being extra though?

784
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,400
Well, I'm not used
to being melodramatic.

785
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,120
Oh?

786
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,200
So I'm melodramatic?

787
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,960
If we keep this up,
I might become one too.

788
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
Mr. Melodramatic!

789
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,000
You wanted to hit me, huh?

790
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,440
You can't hit the one you love.

791
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,600
That's it.

792
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,960
Keep up with these
melodramatic dialogues.

793
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,840
I'm giving you an ultimatum!

794
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,200
Touch me one more time
and I'm calling the cops!

795
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,840
Oh, my God!

796
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,960
What's wrong with our kids?

797
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Did you talk to them?

798
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,360
Talking isn't going to do any good.

799
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Somya does what she wants,
once she's made up her mind.

800
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,000
She's got strong willpower.

801
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,480
Don't get me wrong, Kapil's strong too.

802
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,120
Yoga has made him flexible as rubber.

803
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,280
Quiet.

804
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,000
- What?
- I'm just giving her the facts.

805
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,120
I've thought it over.

806
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,440
Despite everything,

807
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,320
their horoscopes say

808
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,440
they should have a happy marriage.

809
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,040
Happy marriage?!

810
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,520
You said the same thing for me!

811
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,320
There have been fights
since the day I moved in.

812
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,640
First, it was your mom,
now it's your son and his wife.

813
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,040
We took out a loan to get her
married and now she's getting divorced!

814
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,040
Why are you airing our dirty laundry?

815
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,600
Sister, marriages done by
taking a loan don't usually last.

816
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,840
That's why!

817
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,680
What does she mean!

818
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,280
- Mom!
- Somu!

819
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,920
Oh Somu, Somu, Somu!

820
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,600
Come here, my baby.

821
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,440
It's okay, my baby.
It's alright, come sit down. Sit.

822
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,400
- Oh, Somu!
- Wait, let me love on her for a bit.

823
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,440
- You wait.
- Wait.

824
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,080
Oh, my poor baby!

825
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,120
Your father-in-law told me on the phone.

826
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,640
I was taken aback.

827
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,800
Your mom's been looking at
the wedding album on the way here.

828
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,160
It's got my pictures too, right?

829
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,560
I was wearing a Chandheri Zari Sari.

830
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,120
- Remember?
- Oh yeah!

831
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,280
They got torn!

832
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,800
Why are you causing her distress?

833
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,160
This is a "girly" matter.

834
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,360
She won't tell you about it.

835
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,280
I always had a doubt.

836
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,800
Keep your doubt to yourself.

837
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,120
What doubts did you have, huh?

838
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,240
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no!

839
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,280
No, my child!

840
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,720
No, no, no! Your daddy's here.

841
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,120
Don't cry. Don't cry.

842
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,480
I'll talk to Kapil, alright?

843
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,600
She's so tough.

844
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,360
Yeah, sure.

845
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,560
Don't! You'll untie it.

846
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,840
Not in front of everyone.

847
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,920
This is messed up.

848
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,840
Really messed up.

849
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,680
Dad...

850
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,040
Screw Dad!

851
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,640
Dad! Dad!

852
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,480
What Dad? What Dad, huh?

853
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,320
Tell me straight up.

854
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,800
Is there a girl involved in this mess?

855
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,000
No, Dad.

856
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,720
Oh, I get it.

857
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,880
The entire situation has changed.

858
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,680
Do you have a thing for a guy?

859
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,160
What are you talking about, Dad?

860
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
I'm not like that!

861
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,840
I know. "I'm not like that!"

862
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,960
One smack and all your
chakras will align in no time.

863
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,400
He's making excuses!

864
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,680
Why won't you believe me?

865
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,280
I... I...
I swear to God, I'm not like that.

866
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,520
Then what's the issue?

867
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,000
What's the problem?

868
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,080
Hmm?

869
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,120
Listen to me.

870
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,880
I was young once too.

871
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,200
With a black beard and the works.

872
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,800
I was young. I know it.

873
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,880
A person tends to get
bored with the same stuff.

874
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,720
So they start looking for something new,
here and there.

875
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,880
I know.

876
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,480
I'm a man too, I know it.

877
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,640
How do I explain our situation?

878
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,480
Your daughter... the house...

879
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,280
She'll learn to run the house, Kapil.

880
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,200
She's just a kid.

881
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,240
She's just a kid, she'll figure it out.

882
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,480
No one learns this stuff in the womb.

883
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,520
she'll figure it out.

884
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,160
You're not listening to me.

885
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,680
No, you listen to me.

886
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,240
Look...

887
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,720
Hand me the snacks first.

888
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,920
It's your life.

889
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,920
You have to decide.

890
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,480
Whether you want
to sink in a glass or...

891
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,440
Where's it's mom, huh?

892
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,200
The bottle!

893
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,160
Whether you want to
sink in a glass or a bottle?

894
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,560
You have to decide.

895
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:55,760
Son, it's hard to fix
a broken kite's string.

896
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,720
I've flown a bunch of kites in my time.

897
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,120
I had a special kite.

898
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,200
One night,
I kept pulling the string...

899
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,400
Dad! You've had too much to drink!

900
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,120
You've had too many. You're...

901
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,440
Sorry, sorry.

902
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,320
Hey...

903
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,600
Pour me another drink.

904
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,640
What?

905
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,720
Listen.

906
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,680
Roshni only lets me have three drinks.

907
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,360
You've had eight drinks, Dad.

908
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,320
Let's start over then.

909
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,840
This time,
tell me when I have my third drink.

910
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
What's the big deal?

911
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,760
Keep it coming, keep it coming...

912
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,880
Stop, stop, stop!

913
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,080
Milord!

914
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,000
These two people...

915
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,040
Somya Chawla Dubey and Kapil Dubey...

916
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,800
They want to get a divorce!

917
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,240
Go and spit that out first.

918
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
Go.

919
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,680
This is a courtroom and not your home

920
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,000
that you can chew tobacco
as and when you please.

921
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,000
Go!

922
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,400
Crazy!

923
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,760
Made me spit the whole thing!

924
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,560
Where is your lawyer?

925
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
Did you spit it out?

926
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,040
Yes.

927
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,880
In the corner, I presume?

928
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,400
Yes, just around the corner.

929
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,640
Slap him with a fine.

930
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,680
Fine.

931
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,400
But Milord, what I was saying...

932
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,280
You will keep quiet.

933
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,480
Okay, I take silence.

934
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,400
What is the problem?

935
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,600
Hmm?

936
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,800
Why don't you two want to stay together?

937
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,280
Have a kid, travel the world.

938
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,480
You're too young to be
dragging this out in court.

939
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,040
What is going on, Milord!
Why are we talking about babies now?

940
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,240
I told you to...

941
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
What is the issue?

942
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,520
Sir, this man is a liar!

943
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,160
He didn't keep any of his
pre-marriage promises to me.

944
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,280
I know he's online, but he won't
respond to my WhatsApp messages.

945
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,120
Everyone in India would get
divorced if this were the norm.

946
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,360
Even me!

947
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,160
Yes! Yes! Yes!

948
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,040
Yes!

949
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,680
Now we're on the right track.

950
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,640
Yes, sir!

951
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,320
Sir, I don't want to
have a kid with this cheater.

952
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,800
- Never!
- No way!

953
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,720
- Not happening!
- Not in a million years!

954
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,040
Your Honour... sir, I teach yoga.

955
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,640
She's accusing me for no reason.

956
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,600
She's got arrogant because
she has started making more than me.

957
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,200
I can only take so much.

958
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,480
She's climbing higher
than a rocket ship!

959
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,520
Very high!

960
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,280
Even higher than inflation!

961
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:00,480
Son, every divorce has
some ego and blame thrown in.

962
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,320
Come on now...

963
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,720
You two tied the knot
because you were in love, yeah?

964
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,880
Yes, sir.

965
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,160
Yes, sir.

966
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,760
11th June, Wednesday.

967
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,480
She was wearing a beautiful
white dress with flowers on it.

968
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,360
And those Jaipuri sandals!

969
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,080
What is going on, Milord?

970
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,520
- What the hell is going on!
- Councilor!

971
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,480
Will anyone listen to me in here?

972
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,120
Councilor,
did you check out their faces?

973
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,480
They came here to divorce, but they're
sitting super close to each other.

974
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,920
The wife gave her man her
hanky to wipe off his sweat.

975
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,560
And when I yelled at her,
he held her hand to soothe her.

976
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,320
I mean, there's still
some hope for them.

977
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,160
- But Milord...
- So, I'm giving

978
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,680
them a six-month cooling-off period.

979
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,560
That's it.

980
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Brother Manoj...

981
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,040
Brother Manoj...

982
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,160
Don't even get me started,
Sister-in-law.

983
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,840
Is this some kind of
make-out spot or something?

984
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,840
And you...

985
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,040
what's with the red-yellow-
black-green-blue dress talk?

986
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,480
You guys came here to get divorced,
not make out.

987
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,960
You were even holding
hands in the courtroom!

988
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,640
Manoj, six months is way too long.

989
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,600
It'll be tough to handle
everyone in the house.

990
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,760
Our house will turn into a battlefield.

991
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,440
Should we go meet Bhagwan (God)?

992
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
Nope!

993
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,800
I'm barely okay with you getting divorced,
don't even think about suicide!

994
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,200
- Manoj...
- Nope!

995
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,400
Did you just get your law degree online?

996
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,560
Or did you steal somebody else's
and slap your name on it?

997
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,520
He's pushing it too far, Kapil.

998
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,320
What'd you do in the courtroom, huh?

999
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,840
Stop driving me crazy, you guys!

1000
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,840
Kapil...

1001
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,800
The first step is to fix
the Chi energy of this place.

1002
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
My Chi energy is all messed up,

1003
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,760
how am I supposed to fix this?

1004
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,080
- What needs fixing, huh?
- Hey!

1005
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,840
Chi, it's a vibration energy thing.
It's related to yoga.

1006
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,800
- Sit down.
- Okay, okay.

1007
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,800
Vibration.

1008
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,280
We need to pick a direction.

1009
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,600
Going around in circles
isn't going to cut it.

1010
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,440
Ma'am, we're trying to
turn one circle into a square,

1011
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,160
that is, get you a house.

1012
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,400
We got a big goal to reach,
so we need big players.

1013
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,200
Care to explain?

1014
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,120
Or do we need to hire
somebody else to decode it?

1015
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,240
I am already easy,
you need to portray him as easy.

1016
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,840
Question his character.

1017
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,200
Prove he's a pervert.

1018
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,520
- Hey!
- There's another option.

1019
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,360
Prove that he's medically unfit.

1020
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,600
No, no, no.

1021
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,240
Come on dude, don't screw me over.

1022
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:24,760
You'll thank me when you're snoring
in your new air-conditioned room.

1023
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,960
You know the dough's got to
be pressed hard to make crispy wafers.

1024
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,720
Will this speed up the divorce process?

1025
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,920
Faster than fast.

1026
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,120
What do we need to do?

1027
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,280
What do you need to do?

1028
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,520
You need to do something
that he stinks of another woman.

1029
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,080
Catch him naked...
red-handed at a make-out spot,

1030
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,440
then toss the pictures
on the judge's desk.

1031
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,640
You'll see this matter
will be over in minutes.

1032
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,960
What if that doesn't work, though?

1033
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,800
I may cheat, but I'm not a cheater.

1034
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,600
I'll sell my shop if your
appeal gets denied, swear to God!

1035
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,680
Stay away from plants.

1036
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,560
What are you going to
get from these plants anyway?

1037
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,160
Come on, let me take
you to a garden or something.

1038
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,040
Do you have any other ideas
besides these off-the-wall plans?

1039
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,120
I can do a lot,
just need someone to ask me.

1040
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,080
Forget it, bro.
Kapil's going to take me out.

1041
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,920
"Kapil will take me out."

1042
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,600
He doesn't have time to spare.

1043
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,080
He already has his hands full.

1044
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,600
Look at me, I'm a free bird.

1045
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,640
Manoj! Manoj!

1046
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,760
Go and get the gas cylinder.

1047
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
Fly away, free bird.

1048
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,000
Hurry up... stop dillydallying.

1049
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,240
Come on, Dad.
Can't you just be quiet for two seconds?

1050
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,160
Go and get the gas cylinder, he says.

1051
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,160
Be careful with that.

1052
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,200
Kapu...

1053
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,320
Who's in such a hurry?

1054
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,720
Can't a guy take a shower in peace?

1055
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,200
It's me, Kapu. Open the door, quick.

1056
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,840
What's up?

1057
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,960
Just open the door.

1058
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,120
What happened? What are you doing?

1059
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,640
We can't get divorced
if anyone sees us like this.

1060
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,560
Mehjabeen!

1061
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,880
What'd she do?

1062
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,800
You're going to have an affair with her.

1063
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,840
What?

1064
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,960
You want to ruin the
Dubey family's reputation

1065
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,240
so they can't show their
faces around town, don't you?

1066
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,400
It'll be a secret affair.

1067
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,480
We won't be putting out posters of it.

1068
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,760
Don't cut so close, one mistake and
your palace will come crumbling down.

1069
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,480
I just need one photo, Kapu.

1070
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,560
Then she goes to her place
and you go to yours.

1071
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,480
This is the house
I always wanted to live in.

1072
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,520
Please, Kapu... please.

1073
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,800
What? It's been so long!

1074
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,280
- Someone might see us together.
- No one will. I don't care anyway.

1075
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,160
Leave me alone!

1076
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,960
I'm not a blanket you can use
and toss aside whenever you want.

1077
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,360
You...!

1078
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,720
At least you thought of me.

1079
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,840
Mehjabeen,
I don't know what to do or say.

1080
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,080
Kapil, you know,
I've always seen you as a strong guy.

1081
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,400
All we can see are their backs.

1082
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,560
Calm down.

1083
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,760
Seeing you sad like
this is really weird.

1084
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,080
Turn around, turn around.

1085
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,760
Turn around, turn around.

1086
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,800
Why?

1087
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,640
The Chi energy in this place is bad.
It's better over here.

1088
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,200
Turn around.

1089
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,640
- Yes.
- Right?

1090
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,480
It's good.

1091
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,920
Take the pic.

1092
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:22,840
You know I... I just feel
so suffocated inside sometimes.

1093
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I can't get any decent pics.

1094
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,640
I can't talk to anyone
about my feelings.

1095
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,400
- Give it here.
- Hmm.

1096
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,040
You can talk to me.

1097
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,800
You don't need to
feel shy to talk to me.

1098
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,800
This is the first time in years
you've brought me to Megdhoot Garden.

1099
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,680
This day will always...

1100
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,240
It'll always be special for me.

1101
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,880
What's so special about it?

1102
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,200
No...

1103
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,000
We're getting the divorce,
we're getting the house!

1104
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,520
Good morning, ma'am.

1105
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
What are you doing here?

1106
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,560
Same thing you're doing.

1107
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,840
Should I show you what we're doing?

1108
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,480
Should I?

1109
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,800
Get out of here!

1110
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,160
Give me my shoe back before you leave!

1111
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,320
Give it back!

1112
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,480
Milord!

1113
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,080
Secret affair!

1114
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,720
This man's the king of cheating,
lying, and drama!

1115
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,440
Milord, you should
just end this matter now

1116
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,120
before they start beating each other up.

1117
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,800
Stop with the theatrics!

1118
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,120
Come to the point.

1119
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,360
Fine.

1120
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,320
Look at the photos in
the file in front of you.

1121
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,200
We caught him in the act!

1122
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,960
How can my client Somya Chawla stay
with a man like this?

1123
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,440
How can any woman put up with cheating?

1124
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,560
Just stamp the file and close the case.

1125
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,440
Kapil, is this true?

1126
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,840
Sir, a thief's never going
to admit they stole something.

1127
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,080
Kapil Dubey, do you have
anything to say for yourself?

1128
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,560
What? How can he possibly defend this?

1129
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,440
That's how the system works, Milord!

1130
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,680
Men have been treating women
horribly for thousands of years.

1131
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,920
They can do whatever they
want and nothing happens to them.

1132
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,760
Women, on the other hand,
even one little doubt

1133
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,120
and they're forced
to prove their innocence!

1134
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,400
The truth doesn't discriminate, Milord.

1135
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,480
I want justice!

1136
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,280
Easy, Bhagel. You'll blow up.

1137
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,560
Make a note of it.

1138
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,560
Considering the evidence against Kapil,

1139
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,440
the testimony from his wife,

1140
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,800
and Kapil's refusal to speak,
the court...

1141
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,080
grants their divorce.

1142
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,280
Granted.

1143
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,440
Yes, yes, yes!

1144
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,640
YES!

1145
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,280
- Did you grab all the bags?
- Yes, got them all.

1146
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,720
- Her jewelry?
- Got that too!

1147
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,320
We went against the society
and got him married to a Punjabi!

1148
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,840
Just because our boy insisted.

1149
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,840
You didn't check their horoscopes
before setting up the match?

1150
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,520
I have lost faith in horoscopes now.

1151
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,800
I am so confused.

1152
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:07,240
Kapil, you're welcome to swing
by for a couple of drinks anytime.

1153
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,600
- What are you saying?
- Shut up.

1154
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
Pundits live here.

1155
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,440
Calm down.

1156
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,440
Sorry, Mom.

1157
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,840
It's okay, it's okay.

1158
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,280
Oh, Dad!

1159
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,240
Get in the car already!

1160
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,680
Come on!
I feel suffocated here.

1161
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,160
Let's go.

1162
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,880
I feel suffocated here.

1163
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,080
This is too much.

1164
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,720
Let's go.

1165
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,840
Sajjan!

1166
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,520
- Come on kid, say goodbye to her.
- Leave me.

1167
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,080
- Move it. Move it, move it.
- Bye.

1168
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,280
Get in.

1169
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:54,960
Drive.

1170
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,840
Mom, she just winked at brother!

1171
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,280
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Hit the brakes! Hit the brakes!

1172
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,520
What?

1173
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,720
- What?
- What is it?

1174
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,400
You coming from Gwalior?

1175
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,960
Nope, Pardesi Pura.

1176
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,920
The car is registered in Gwalior though.

1177
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,120
Any problem?

1178
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,440
Driving a Gwalior registered
car in Indore, huh?

1179
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,520
Did you steal it or what?

1180
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,840
Where're your manners?

1181
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,120
Who do you think you are?

1182
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,640
I am Daroga (cop).

1183
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,040
The in-charge of this place.

1184
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:07,240
Hi.

1185
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,600
License and registration, please.

1186
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,760
Yeah, sure thing. Got them right here.

1187
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,880
What are you doing?

1188
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,680
Getting the wallet out!

1189
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,920
What're you doing she says!

1190
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,840
Here's my license.

1191
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,360
Harcharan Chawla.

1192
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,600
Any problem?

1193
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,400
Do you have your ID card on you?

1194
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,080
ID card?

1195
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,760
Since when do we need
an ID Card to drive a car?

1196
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:31,880
Since today.

1197
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,480
I didn't see that in the news.

1198
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,160
It's breaking news, sir.

1199
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,800
Just give it to him.

1200
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,920
- He's being a bit much now.
- It's okay. Give it to him.

1201
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,160
- Here.
- Here you go.

1202
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,720
Harcharan Chawla.

1203
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,160
Did you make this card today?

1204
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
You're wearing the same turban.

1205
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,760
Yes, I'm wearing the same turban.

1206
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,600
Is it linked to your PAN card?

1207
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,800
No, it's not!

1208
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:53,840
Do what you want to!

1209
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,080
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

1210
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,080
- This is getting ridiculous!
- Calm down.

1211
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,240
Listen, I am Somya Chawla Dubey.

1212
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,040
Chawla Dubey?

1213
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:00,960
Yes.

1214
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,880
- Two last names, huh?
- Yes.

1215
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,720
What does your husband do for a living?

1216
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,080
- He's a yoga teacher.
- She's divorced.

1217
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,320
Why did they split up?

1218
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,080
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Watch it!

1219
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,920
Which police station
are you reporting to, huh?

1220
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,280
They don't ask these many
questions even at the airport!

1221
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,560
I'm not a cop, I'm Daroga.

1222
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,520
My name is Daroga Raghuvanshi.

1223
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,920
I'm the head of security around here.

1224
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,240
There you go!

1225
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,800
Listen, we just rented D-304.

1226
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:29,880
When?

1227
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,920
Don't bother answering him,
he's just a rent-a-cop.

1228
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,440
Buzz off.
And give me my papers back.

1229
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,040
Take it easy, sir.

1230
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,040
Slow down.
Slow down, hubby.

1231
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,840
These snacks are from
the Prakash Namkeen Store. Try some.

1232
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,840
It's delicious.

1233
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,440
All the paperwork is good to go.

1234
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,800
May I say something?

1235
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,120
Only the lucky ones get the Lord
and Milord's seal of approval.

1236
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,480
Now, there's just one thing left to do.

1237
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,640
Slap down 400K on the table

1238
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,360
and watch your car take
off to heaven with this pilot.

1239
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,440
What have you been smoking, man?

1240
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,840
400K cash?

1241
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,960
If I had that kind of money,

1242
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,840
I'd book a bungalow on Yashwant Road

1243
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,520
and not be running circles with you.

1244
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,240
You're getting too worked up too fast.

1245
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,240
I don't smoke crap and
I don't put up with any nonsense.

1246
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,080
Don't try to be slick with me.

1247
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,600
I'm not trying to be slick,
just stating the facts.

1248
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,960
- Then state them.
- Alright,

1249
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,640
the fact is that location matters
when it comes to flats, right?

1250
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,320
It sure does.

1251
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,160
And you're getting one worth
4.5 million for just 2.4 million,

1252
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,760
so you got to grease some palms,
don't you?

1253
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,720
The government officer asked for 500K.

1254
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,240
I told him you were desperate
and like family to me,

1255
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,240
- so he settled for 400K.
- Family?

1256
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,760
But we don't have 400K in cash.

1257
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,720
Why not take some now
and we'll figure out the rest later?

1258
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,880
How are we supposed to come
up with the rest of the money?

1259
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,720
We can't just give
him whatever he asks for!

1260
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,640
You should have told us sooner!

1261
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,920
We could have planned better.

1262
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,160
Let me tell you a little story.

1263
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,280
When the Reaper came for my soul,

1264
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,040
I told him to wait until I was done
so we could go together, full and final.

1265
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,760
I don't like to live in installments.

1266
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,280
Listen, we got divorced
because you asked us to!

1267
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,080
Why did you have to start
this nonsense now?

1268
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,280
Let's go, Somya.

1269
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,160
- Hold on, let's hear him out, Kapil.
- I've heard enough.

1270
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,440
He's cooking up new stories every day.

1271
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,920
Let's go.

1272
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,160
You're calling me?

1273
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,560
Kapu!

1274
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,240
He knows me.

1275
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,520
So, this is to trick him.

1276
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,800
They didn't have bigger teeth available?

1277
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,080
They did, but they cost too much.

1278
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,400
Don't worry about it.

1279
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,400
I've got everything set up.

1280
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,560
Let's go.

1281
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,720
- Come with me.
- Let's go.

1282
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,960
"Be careful..."

1283
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,880
"Be careful..."

1284
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,280
"Be careful..."

1285
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,600
"Be careful..."

1286
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,560
Is the application
going to be in your name?

1287
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,400
Yes.

1288
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,520
It's a lottery system.

1289
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,840
I'm sure you must
have read the whole form.

1290
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,160
We know it's a lottery system.

1291
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,200
But ultimately,
it's in your hands, right?

1292
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:13,480
Who is he?

1293
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,840
My brother.

1294
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,480
So, what were you saying, Mr. Brother?

1295
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,960
What's in my hands?

1296
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:29,160
Sir, I was just wondering
if we could make a deal or something?

1297
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,920
You're trying to grease my palms!

1298
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,760
You're bribing me!

1299
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,680
It is because of brothers like
you that sisters are in this condition.

1300
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,360
You have got our society so messed up!

1301
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,920
Ultimately, all the responsibility
falls on government officials like me.

1302
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,960
Tell him your contact's name.

1303
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:46,200
Hmm.

1304
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,280
Sir...

1305
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,240
Ramakant Chaurasia
told me to come see you.

1306
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,400
The one who runs the
Chaurasia Paan Bhandaar?

1307
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,680
Yes!

1308
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,080
Get this straight!

1309
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,280
If I report you to my higher-ups,
you'll never be able to apply again.

1310
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,640
He's shamelessly trying
to bribe a government official.

1311
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,200
Don't let him raise
your blood pressure, sir.

1312
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,000
You enjoy your tea, I'll handle him.

1313
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,960
Let's "fly away".

1314
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,880
Follow me.

1315
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,200
"Be careful..."

1316
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,920
Your contact is just a street vendor?

1317
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,440
Enjoy your tea, old man.

1318
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,480
Don't take government
officials lightly, bro.

1319
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,200
You got divorced over this
and now you're playing dress-up?

1320
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:44,160
There are tons of watchdogs around here
who can smell a fake from a mile away!

1321
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,200
You'll get arrested for fraud!

1322
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,000
You'll be chomping on prison
bars with those teeth of yours.

1323
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,680
"If I go down, I'm taking you with me."

1324
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,800
You wouldn't lower your price,
so I had to do something.

1325
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,520
He thinks he is Phantom!

1326
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,960
Tell me what I need to do, Mr. Bhagwan.

1327
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,120
I'll do what needs
to be done from my end.

1328
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,240
Did you bring the demand draft with you?

1329
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,480
Yes.

1330
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,640
Perfect.

1331
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:14,120
Mr. Dubey, feel free to chow down
on the snacks while we handle this.

1332
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,440
Go for it!

1333
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,480
Go!

1334
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:17,840
Go.

1335
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,520
You come with me.

1336
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,840
Here you go.

1337
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:49,440
We already got the slip.

1338
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,960
- Take care of it.
- Sure thing.

1339
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,760
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1340
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,200
So, we have submitted the form.

1341
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,080
Yes.

1342
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,200
Listen, now you have
to cough up 400K

1343
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,160
and your name will
get picked in the lottery.

1344
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,680
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1345
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,600
One more thing, maintain "social distance"
from your "brother" until then.

1346
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,640
- Understood?
- Yes.

1347
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,720
This way, please.

1348
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,160
Thank you.

1349
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,680
Where's this address at?
This one.

1350
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,720
Go straight and take a left...

1351
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,240
Let Bhagwan do his thing,

1352
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,920
don't go trying to find another contact.

1353
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,840
We still need to get the cash together.

1354
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,520
Hey!

1355
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,760
- What's he doing here?
- Stop.

1356
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,760
Don't say a word.

1357
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,640
Who is this guy, sis?

1358
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,200
My brother.

1359
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,600
You didn't mention him before.

1360
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,000
Are you a lawyer or something?

1361
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,320
Do we have to submit an affidavit
with every detail in it?

1362
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,160
I am the security head here.

1363
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,600
What's your brother's name?

1364
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,160
Sunny!

1365
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,880
- Sunny Chawla!
- No,

1366
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,720
it's Sunny Dubey Chawla.

1367
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,920
Huh?

1368
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,600
Sunny Dubey Chawla

1369
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,520
Do you have your ID card on you?

1370
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,480
I have a passport
and Ration card too.

1371
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,160
You want to see it?

1372
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:05,920
Look, the thing is...

1373
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,200
Look at what? Just write down my name.

1374
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,120
Dad! Dad! Mom's calling you, let's go!

1375
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,920
I have his details.

1376
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,400
Let me know next time he comes around.

1377
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,600
I will.

1378
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,520
You have a very demanding mom, huh?

1379
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,640
Let's go.

1380
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,320
That dude's a little nuts.

1381
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,240
He's just a security guard.

1382
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,240
Yeah, he's kind of crazy.

1383
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:34,400
Kapil, we'll have to stay on our toes.

1384
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,120
Screw that!

1385
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,160
You know how I feel?

1386
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,360
How?

1387
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,680
Remember when we first
started seeing each other?

1388
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,880
We used to sneak off to Chappan...
to grab a bite.

1389
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,160
And I used to drop
you back at the hostel?

1390
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,160
Whenever you walked in that gate,

1391
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,240
I'd stand outside and watch you leave.

1392
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,360
My heart used to be racing.

1393
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,160
You know why?

1394
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,280
Why?

1395
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,680
Because I always wondered
when I'd see you again.

1396
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,200
My heart's racing like that again today.

1397
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,720
I'm wondering when I'll see you next.

1398
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,040
Somebody's caught the love bug,
am I right?

1399
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,480
Making fun of me, huh?

1400
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,040
One day, you're going
to be yearning for me too.

1401
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
What?

1402
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,520
Hey!

1403
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,840
You crazy girl!

1404
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,280
Over here.

1405
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,360
"For you, I will get the moon,"

1406
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,600
"I will get a handful
of stars along too,"

1407
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,800
"For you, I will get the moon,"

1408
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,920
"I will get a handful
of stars along too,"

1409
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,080
"Request the stars
and moon to wait a while,"

1410
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,320
"Request the stars
and moon to wait a while,"

1411
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:06,480
"Until I've swept my girl
off her feet with style,"

1412
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,720
"Until I've swept my girl
off her feet with style,"

1413
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,920
"For you, I will get the moon,"

1414
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,360
"I will get a handful
of stars along too,"

1415
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,440
"If the truth be told,"

1416
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:36,560
"Being with you in this
lifetime makes it complete,"

1417
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,880
"your face is like the moon,
shining bright,"

1418
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,800
"Your eyes twinkle like stars at night,"

1419
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,000
"There is no reason
for me to seek the sky,"

1420
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,400
"There is no reason
for me to seek the sky,"

1421
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,640
"If you still yearn,
I'll gladly comply,"

1422
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,800
"Your every desire, I will supply,"

1423
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,960
"For you, I will get the moon,"

1424
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,200
"I will get a handful
of stars along too,"

1425
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,320
"For you, I will get the moon,"

1426
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,440
"I will get a handful
of stars along too,"

1427
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,640
"A troublemaker mister, you'll see,"

1428
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,360
"So be cautious lest
you fall victim to me!"

1429
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,000
"A troublemaker mister, you'll see,"

1430
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,600
"So be cautious lest
you fall victim to me!"

1431
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,800
First, we have to get
our Chi energy aligned.

1432
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,280
Chi?

1433
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,040
Chi... aka vibration, energy.

1434
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,280
Everything depends on this.

1435
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,960
Yoga is nothing
but an exercise without it.

1436
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,400
Just like Poha without onions.

1437
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,520
Today, we'll learn how to balance

1438
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,560
our bodies,

1439
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,680
minds,

1440
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,080
and thoughts.

1441
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:06,040
How?

1442
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,000
- By doing the Tree Pose.
- Correct.

1443
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,400
So lift your right leg,
and place it on your left thigh.

1444
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:24,560
Now slowly raise your
hands and take a deep breath.

1445
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,440
Very good.

1446
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,480
What are you doing here?

1447
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,480
Taking a deep breath with you.

1448
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,840
Stop this drama.

1449
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,640
You stop it.

1450
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,800
I know why you divorced Somya.

1451
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,000
What... what do you know?

1452
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,080
The same thing you're too scared to say.

1453
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,040
Did Manoj tell you?

1454
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,200
Does Manoj know?

1455
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,520
He knows everything.

1456
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,640
No one else knows.

1457
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:12,760
Okay, so you can tell Manoj but not me?

1458
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,120
How could I have told you?

1459
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,520
You are such a duh.

1460
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,880
We both like each other,

1461
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,000
and everyone knows that except us.

1462
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,400
Stupid.

1463
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,520
- Yo Kapil,
- Yes, Gopi.

1464
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,040
are we supposed to meditate or what?

1465
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,000
No, relax. Relax.

1466
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,360
Brother! Brother!
You're getting a call from Gopi!

1467
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,280
Gopi is calling you, Brother!

1468
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,840
It's Gopi calling you.

1469
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,000
Who?

1470
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,520
Gopi is calling you, Brother.

1471
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,640
Hold on, don't answer it.

1472
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,000
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1473
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,360
You take forever to answer my calls.

1474
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,680
You got another girl
in your life or what?

1475
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,960
I was taking a shower.

1476
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,120
He got a call from Gopi.

1477
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,680
Something is fishy.

1478
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,640
Listen, I have good news.

1479
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,760
Did Bhagwan call you?

1480
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,200
Mom's leaving for Gwalior tonight.

1481
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,920
Can you come over this evening?

1482
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,800
That's awesome, love!

1483
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:42,440
If I ever say no to that,
you can stab me!

1484
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,440
- I told you! She is the one.
- Kapu...

1485
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,560
Are you coming or not?

1486
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:47,160
Get ready to do the nasty!

1487
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,520
What does "do the nasty" mean?

1488
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,680
Shut up!

1489
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,160
He's coming this way, let's go.

1490
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,240
Why is this thing here?

1491
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,720
I can't hear anything.

1492
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,200
Brother,
he's getting ready to meet Gopi.

1493
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,560
Don't worry about it.

1494
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,040
Gopi is a guy's name.

1495
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,640
That's what we're worried about.

1496
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,600
You know how guys are,
they've lost their sense of direction!

1497
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,920
Guys have lost their
sense of direction, my foot!

1498
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,480
Gopi can be a girl's name too.

1499
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,360
Right.

1500
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,720
Remember, my aunt's sister-in-law's
daughter's name is Gopi.

1501
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,880
Either he's confused
or he has us confused.

1502
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,840
"You are my Coca-Cola!"

1503
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,240
"You are my love!"

1504
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,600
Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

1505
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,480
Where to?

1506
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,400
To... to my sister's place.

1507
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,120
Somya Chawla Dubey.

1508
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,320
Which one of her brothers are you?

1509
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
What do you mean?

1510
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,280
She has another brother
who keeps coming over.

1511
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,760
Something is fishy.

1512
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,840
That was me!

1513
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,280
I mean that's me!

1514
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,720
I was wearing glasses
and had one bucktooth.

1515
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,000
Two big buckteeth!

1516
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,200
You had two buckteeth.

1517
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,640
I took them off.

1518
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,240
But I don't see any missing.

1519
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,920
These are real, those were fake.

1520
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,840
Dude, I work in the theater.

1521
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,840
That day I came here straight from
the show, so I was still in the getup.

1522
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,840
Oh, so you're a drama guy!

1523
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,640
It runs in the family.

1524
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,360
I can see that.

1525
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:02,400
You're early for once.

1526
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,280
Oh, Mrs. Chawla Dubey!

1527
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,280
- You know what?
- What?

1528
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,520
- If I stay away from you for long then...
- Then?

1529
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,200
Then my whole body
starts hyperventilating.

1530
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,560
- Show me.
- Show you what?

1531
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,680
Show me how.

1532
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,120
I miss you, Somya.

1533
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,200
Really?

1534
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,400
I can't stop thinking about you.

1535
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,080
How's everyone at home?

1536
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,080
They're good.

1537
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,760
They think I'm having an affair.

1538
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,440
With?

1539
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,880
With a stubborn girl.

1540
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,080
Oh really?

1541
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,440
She teaches at a coaching center.

1542
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,520
Tell me Mr. Dubey,

1543
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:49,640
then why are you secretly meeting your
wife...

1544
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,600
when you have this stubborn girl?

1545
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:56,640
I feel like I'm back at the lodge.

1546
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,280
It's so weird to stay alone, Kapu.

1547
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,200
There's no one to mess things up.

1548
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,480
Things stay the way I leave them.

1549
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
There's no dirty laundry on the floor
or used teacups on the table.

1550
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,240
The towel never leaves the bathroom.

1551
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,920
And don't even ask

1552
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,600
how much miss our 5-star chocolates!

1553
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,440
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

1554
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,880
Man, it's freezing in here!

1555
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:00,760
The water heater is busted.

1556
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,720
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1557
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,640
Was the water too cold?

1558
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:03,600
Way too cold.

1559
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,800
Really cold.

1560
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:05,960
Really cold.

1561
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,720
I'll get late.

1562
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,520
I'm going to be late
for the coaching center.

1563
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,080
- Come on, girl.
- Let me go.

1564
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,560
Yes?

1565
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,040
I'm here from the Public Housing
Scheme office... for verification?

1566
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,240
Sure thing. Come on in.

1567
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,760
Take a seat.

1568
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,240
Somya Chawla Dubey?

1569
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,200
Yeah, she lives here.

1570
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,320
She's in the shower right now.

1571
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,000
- And you are...?
- I'm her...

1572
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,440
plumber!

1573
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,520
Just fixing the hot water issue.

1574
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,360
How many bathrooms are in this place?

1575
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,880
Just one. It's a rental.

1576
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,360
Madam!

1577
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,800
Hey, Somya!

1578
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,960
A Public Housing Scheme officer
is here for you.

1579
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,280
Hurry up! I have to rush.

1580
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,240
Hi!

1581
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,640
Somya Chawla Dubey.

1582
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,480
Hey! Hi!

1583
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,480
You're quite open-minded.

1584
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,680
Excuse me?

1585
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,000
Abhinav Gupta.

1586
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,280
I'm here for verification.

1587
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,360
Carry on then.

1588
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,400
So, how long has
it been since your divorce?

1589
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,000
Around 40 days.

1590
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,520
And you applied
for the scheme pretty quickly.

1591
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,440
Excuse me?

1592
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,720
Just that there's a lot
of fraud going around these days.

1593
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,280
Right, right.

1594
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,240
I just have to make
sure everything checks out.

1595
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:40,920
Right.

1596
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,800
Your security guard downstairs
said you live here with your mom?

1597
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,240
Yes.

1598
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,320
She went to Gwalior this morning,
but she'll be back soon.

1599
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,640
Ask your brother Sunny
to move his motorcycle.

1600
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,040
And your dad mentioned
that the water heater's busted.

1601
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,200
- I can fix it in a jiffy.
- No!

1602
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:55,200
No need!

1603
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,680
I already had cold showers.

1604
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,480
It was nice.

1605
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,440
You're crazy or what?

1606
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,240
I take showers early.

1607
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,480
I can fix it in a jiffy.

1608
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,720
No need!
I'm done.

1609
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,960
You'll catch a cold, sis.

1610
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:03,880
No, I won't.

1611
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,640
Your brother stays here with you?

1612
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,280
- Sunny!
- Sunny!

1613
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:12,000
He's not here right now.

1614
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,800
He went out for a job
interview this morning.

1615
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,960
He'll be back soon.

1616
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,560
Didn't he work with a theater group?

1617
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,320
A theater group?

1618
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,120
Hey!

1619
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,560
The coil's fried, ma'am.
You need a new one.

1620
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,160
Coil got burnt?

1621
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,240
Wait a minute... You look familiar.

1622
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,240
I'm the plumber for this area.
You might have seen me around.

1623
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,440
Really? Because I usually handle
all the plumbing jobs around here.

1624
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:38,440
- You do?
- Where did he come from?

1625
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:39,920
Then I'm going to file a complaint
with the Indore Plumbing Association.

1626
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,520
Let me go.

1627
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,000
- When did that happen?
- It's brand new, man.

1628
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,960
But I didn't see you come in.

1629
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,080
That's not my problem.
You can see me leave.

1630
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,240
Hey listen,
did you fix Mr. Sharma's faucet?

1631
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,560
- It's leaking again.
- Should I check the water heater?

1632
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:53,880
Nah, just check the paperwork.

1633
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,080
Check the paperwork.

1634
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,920
This is up to the kids.

1635
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,160
We should wait for Kapil to arrive.

1636
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,160
Hmm.

1637
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,120
Ah, there he is.

1638
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,040
What's going on here, huh?

1639
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,480
You've only been divorced for 40 days

1640
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,240
and already have marriage
offers coming in?

1641
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,480
Son, have some respect for us.

1642
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,920
What's happening here?

1643
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,200
The same thing you're too scared to say.

1644
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,360
There!

1645
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,920
No, I think there's been some confusion.

1646
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,560
You turned down Rashid for this guy?

1647
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,600
She turned him down!

1648
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,560
Pandit ji, we've respected you.

1649
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,200
We trusted you,
and this is how you repay us?

1650
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:55,080
Mr. Khan, give us some time to think.

1651
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,720
Let us talk to Kapil.

1652
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,040
Mehjabeen is like a daughter to us.

1653
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,280
She's grown up here.

1654
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,520
Yes.

1655
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,800
I don't know what is going on.

1656
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,320
What you are doing is what is going on.

1657
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,200
Choose a direction.

1658
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,600
Gopi or Gopinath.

1659
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,440
Brother-in-law, we'll soon
have Namaz done at a priest's house.

1660
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,000
Don't.

1661
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,480
What did Shri Krishna tell
Arjun during the war for righteousness?

1662
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,440
Listen, dude,

1663
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,800
my wife is staying in a rental.

1664
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,200
I have marriage proposals coming in,

1665
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,040
and my uncle and aunt
are adding fuel to the fire.

1666
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,720
We've already sold our
kidneys and given you 400K.

1667
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,040
So spare me the lecture.

1668
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,040
We have a lot of
complications in our lives.

1669
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,240
The milk is about to boil over,
so when will we get the allotment?

1670
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,440
Yeah, tell us that.

1671
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,920
Can I tell you a secret?

1672
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,640
The allotment list
comes out on the 16th.

1673
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,520
Your name will be on the
list and the house will be yours.

1674
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,160
Please be patient
for a couple more days.

1675
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,720
On the 16th.

1676
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,080
- This month?
- Yep.

1677
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,240
I swear, on the 16th... of this month.

1678
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,800
I swear to God.

1679
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,640
- God bless you.
- God helps those who help themselves.

1680
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,000
All I need is your blessings.

1681
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,360
Finally!

1682
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,840
Oh, Kapu!

1683
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,520
- Kapu...
- Hmm?

1684
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,600
Thank you.

1685
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,800
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1686
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,000
How about a hug, man?

1687
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,240
Come here, Brother Manoj!

1688
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,120
Oh, Brother Manoj!

1689
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1690
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:55,560
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

1691
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,680
Cheers!

1692
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:07,560
Hey, Mr. Daroga!

1693
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,600
Is this your family?

1694
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,160
Yes, Ms. Somya,

1695
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,280
My wife Rashmi,

1696
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,360
Hello.

1697
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,960
and my daughter, Sushma.

1698
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,520
- Sushma.
- Hi.

1699
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,120
What grade are you in?

1700
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,520
6th grade.

1701
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,760
Wow!

1702
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,080
Do you study hard?

1703
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,600
Of course,
how else will I become an engineer?

1704
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,320
That's great!

1705
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,280
Here, have a piece of cake.

1706
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,320
No, thanks, sis.

1707
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,440
Let her have it.

1708
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,040
Daroga... join us.

1709
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,680
Let's have a drink.

1710
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,320
We just bought a new house.

1711
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,560
Bro...

1712
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,600
Having your own house
is everyone's dream.

1713
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,840
When I came to Indore,
I also wanted my own house,

1714
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,600
but the high cost
of living makes it hard.

1715
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,440
So, we have to scrape by

1716
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,920
and live under the open sky.

1717
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,800
You live out here?

1718
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,960
Yes, bro.

1719
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,080
I work as a security guard here,
and my wife works as a housekeeper.

1720
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,760
It helps save some money.

1721
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,960
But... life in the city is too fast.

1722
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,720
Look at the two of you,

1723
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,760
brother and sister drinking together.

1724
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,800
This is great.

1725
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,880
Sushma.

1726
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,920
I'll get going, sis.

1727
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,320
She's scared I might
have a drink or two.

1728
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,280
She knows my limits.

1729
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:41,920
Bye.

1730
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,360
Brother and sister?

1731
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,200
When did she become your sister?

1732
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,360
So make Mehjabeen your sister too.

1733
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,040
No, why?

1734
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,360
What are you looking at?

1735
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,520
Our dreams coming true.

1736
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,160
Look over there.

1737
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,320
That's our home!

1738
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:24,120
No, it's not!

1739
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,200
Our home is in Kanchan Bhaag.

1740
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:27,720
That's Satya Sai Chouraha.

1741
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,400
Stay realistic, Somya.

1742
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,320
- I don't want to.
- You don't?

1743
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,120
- Nope.
- You don't?

1744
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,120
Nope.

1745
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,360
I swear on Goddess Narmada,

1746
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,600
looking at you two makes
me want to get married,

1747
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,240
get divorced, and play this game too.

1748
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,120
- Brother Manoj!
- Brother Manoj!

1749
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,160
You should stick to playing
the law and order game.

1750
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:01,760
What's this noise about?

1751
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,360
Let's go.

1752
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,840
- What's going on with this crowd?
- I have no clue.

1753
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,360
Ask them.

1754
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,800
Did they post the list?

1755
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:15,000
No, they haven't.

1756
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,400
They didn't post the list at all?

1757
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,680
What does that even mean?

1758
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,760
- Let's go find out.
- Yeah, let's go.

1759
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:19,800
Police! Police!

1760
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,280
Move out of the way so she can pass!

1761
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,520
- Step back!
- She's a cop!

1762
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,680
- Make room! Move!
- Police! Police!

1763
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,160
We're cops too! Let us in.

1764
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,600
- You can't go in there.
- Why not?

1765
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,920
I'm a lawyer.
I'll sue you if you don't let us pass.

1766
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Get out of my way!

1767
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,640
Don't worry. Let's go and find out.

1768
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:36,000
Come back in a couple of days
and I'll give you an update.

1769
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,080
Hey, buddy,
why didn't they post the list outside?

1770
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,200
I don't know.

1771
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,040
How do you not know?

1772
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,680
Call Bhagwan Das.

1773
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:43,680
Bhagwan Das is on leave.

1774
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,240
- Come back later to inquire.
- But...

1775
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,040
Come with me.

1776
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,320
Let's see what we can do.

1777
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,320
What's going to happen, Brother Manoj?

1778
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,440
Don't worry, we'll figure something out.

1779
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,560
Come with me.

1780
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,520
Bhagwan Das said
it'll be out on the 16th.

1781
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,680
Why didn't they post the list?

1782
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,000
Call Kapil.

1783
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,400
I'm trying.

1784
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,400
Hi!

1785
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,240
What flat number have we been allotted?

1786
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,520
Floor? Floor?

1787
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,200
Which floor did we get?

1788
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,520
They didn't post any list.

1789
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,360
No one knows anything.
Bhagwan's on leave.

1790
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,000
Calm down. Calm down, everyone.

1791
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,280
Listen to me very carefully.

1792
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,920
The houses that were to be allotted

1793
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,760
through the lottery system
under the Public Housing Scheme,

1794
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,240
its allotment has
been delayed indefinitely

1795
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,120
due to special circumstances.

1796
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,040
Delayed?

1797
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:30,280
We don't know when
the list will come out.

1798
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,280
What did I do?

1799
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,880
You could've at least
come on time today.

1800
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,120
Stop talking nonsense!

1801
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,960
My being late didn't stop
them from posting the list.

1802
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,040
Let's go talk to Bhagwan.

1803
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,120
See what he's been up to.

1804
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,880
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1805
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,200
Don't spare him.

1806
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,280
Thrash him.

1807
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,280
Beat him.

1808
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,560
I think he's the cause of the delay.

1809
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,480
Happy now?

1810
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:40,160
Don't bug me, Kapil.

1811
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,000
My wish..

1812
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,760
Breaking news from Indore.

1813
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,080
The allotment under
the Public Housing Scheme

1814
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,120
in Indore has been postponed,

1815
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,680
causing trouble for the applicants.

1816
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,560
The officials haven't given a statement

1817
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,760
and the government
has not cleared its stance.

1818
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,600
This delay is just a cover-up.

1819
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,440
Everyone from the minister
to the peon wants a piece.

1820
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,760
Right.

1821
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,520
You reap what you sow.

1822
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,960
Right.

1823
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:20,080
I can't believe people fall
for these schemes. Are they stupid?

1824
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:24,080
You've been coughing all morning!

1825
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:26,640
How many times have I
told you to lay off fried food?

1826
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,600
But you never listen to me!

1827
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,160
Kapu, why aren't
you picking up my calls?

1828
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,320
I'm scared. Like, literally shaking.

1829
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,040
We got divorced because of this scheme

1830
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,080
and we even invested
400K into it, Somya.

1831
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,400
How much longer are
they going to delay this?

1832
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,560
Are we supposed to live
apart like this forever?

1833
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,480
I'm at my wit's end, Kapil.

1834
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,880
I think we should just tell
our family the truth.

1835
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,040
Have you lost your mind?

1836
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,280
Huh?

1837
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,880
We already have enough going on.
We don't need more drama!

1838
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,000
But Kapil, they might be
able to help us find a solution.

1839
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,200
And now you want their help?

1840
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,120
You had a problem with
them not too long ago, remember?

1841
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,920
That's why we worked
so hard for a new home.

1842
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,160
Look Somya, I'm not in the
right frame of mind right now.

1843
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,240
Just go to sleep and let me think.

1844
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,840
Want some cookies?

1845
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,440
I made them,

1846
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:11,840
while learning to cook online.

1847
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,280
Have a bite and tell me if they're good.

1848
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,040
Is your dad still mad at you?

1849
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,360
Why does it matter?

1850
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,040
What happened that day wasn't right.

1851
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,120
Look Kapil,
we've been friends since childhood.

1852
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,120
Even your marriage
couldn't come between us.

1853
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,920
Just consider it...

1854
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,880
as a bad dream.

1855
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:42,080
I swear, one day
I'll explain everything to you.

1856
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:50,480
Somya! What are you doing here?

1857
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,440
You keep ignoring my calls!

1858
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,480
Because you're being stubborn.

1859
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,200
I am being stubborn?

1860
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,080
And you're here eating cookies?

1861
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,400
- Hello, madam.
- Somya...

1862
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,600
Your chapter is closed.

1863
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,120
Don't try to get Kapil's attention now.

1864
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,440
What are you saying, Somya?

1865
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,440
She's been after him since childhood!

1866
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,640
Can't you see he's
not interested in you?

1867
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,520
Look Somya, it's not as it seems.

1868
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:14,360
Kapil's just a friend of mine.

1869
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:15,640
Sure he is!

1870
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:17,760
You can keep trying, but you're
not going to get anywhere with him.

1871
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,600
You have outlived your usefulness.

1872
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,240
What's she saying, Kapil?

1873
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,800
What's wrong with you, Somya?

1874
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,200
Don't you have any manners left?

1875
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,640
We had enough drama yesterday.

1876
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,400
Bhagwan Das is in jail

1877
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,960
and we don't know what's
going to happen next.

1878
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,880
Do you have any idea
how long this could go on for?

1879
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,440
That's what I've been telling you!

1880
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,600
Let's tell our families the truth!

1881
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:36,120
- What do you want to tell them?
- Just wait.

1882
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,360
Use your head, Somya.
They're investigating the matter.

1883
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,120
If we involve our families,
the situation could get worse.

1884
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,320
We'll have to sell
all our family jewelry

1885
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:44,600
if we too end up getting investigated.

1886
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,880
- Why are you always so scared, Kapil?
- Yes, I am scared!

1887
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:51,640
We are in this situation
because of your stubbornness!

1888
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,600
We need to think before we act.

1889
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,400
You don't need to be a
rocket scientist to know that!

1890
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:02,840
This is what you're good at!
Always blaming someone else!

1891
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:04,640
Just drop it!

1892
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:07,680
Daughter-in-law?

1893
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:12,240
Sister, she's not your
daughter-in-law anymore.

1894
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,600
Looks like a love triangle to me.

1895
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,680
Don't be disheartened, Somya.

1896
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:28,640
As a math teacher, I know that addition
and subtraction are part of life.

1897
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,280
I loved him.

1898
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,480
I trusted him.

1899
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,200
I understand your pain,

1900
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:42,960
but when one door closes,

1901
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,200
another one opens...

1902
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,000
That Mahjabeen...!

1903
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:53,320
How could she take advantage
of someone's broken marriage?

1904
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,240
People like her should be put on blast.

1905
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,400
You want me to order coffee for you?

1906
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,920
I'll take you home.

1907
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,600
I'm headed that way and I have a car.

1908
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,360
Still sulking, bro?

1909
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,360
I'm not in the mood for this.

1910
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:32,720
You need to fix the crack

1911
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,600
before they break permanently.

1912
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,200
I heard some rumors in court

1913
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,000
that the housing scheme matter
could go on for a long time.

1914
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,200
Go tell Somya.

1915
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,120
She's the one who wants
that house so badly.

1916
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,040
I've done 107 divorces.

1917
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:51,720
You were number 108.

1918
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,040
From what I've seen,

1919
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,880
the foundation of relationships

1920
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,800
that lead to divorce is often wrong.

1921
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,400
But you and Somya have something pure.

1922
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:13,400
Save it, or you won't even realize
when this fake divorce turns real.

1923
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,200
Hey bro!

1924
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:31,960
You're going back and forth
from Gwalior to Indore a lot, huh?

1925
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,200
You got a big show
going on or something?

1926
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,160
Not today.

1927
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,160
Thank you.

1928
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:01,760
What do you want now?

1929
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,840
I can only come to you
if I need something or what, Somya?

1930
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,840
Seems like it.

1931
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,040
What is wrong with you, Somya?

1932
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:12,320
Why are you saying that?

1933
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,680
Ms. Somya, is he disturbing you?

1934
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,440
What is this "Dimpy Sir" saying, huh?

1935
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,280
Are you going to tell
him or should I tell him

1936
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,120
what do you really
think about this idiot?

1937
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,560
Should I call the cops?

1938
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,080
Stay in your lane, weirdo.

1939
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,800
I am talking to my wife!

1940
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,800
You guys got divorced, Kapil.

1941
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
She's not your wife anymore.

1942
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:32,040
Want me to do the math
and tell you who's related to who?

1943
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,000
Kapil...

1944
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,880
Sorry, Dimpy Sir. You should leave.

1945
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,760
I don't want you causing
a scene here, got it?

1946
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,640
Don't worry, Ms. Somya. I got your back.

1947
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,360
What's he doing here?

1948
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,600
Feel free to accuse me of anything!

1949
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,320
If I wanted to do it,
I would've done it a long time ago.

1950
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:51,720
You wouldn't do jack!

1951
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,920
You made false promises and trapped me!

1952
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,400
I should be living
in a bungalow in Canada

1953
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:56,640
with my dogs taking
a spin in my Porsche!

1954
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:57,880
You love playing with people, don't you?

1955
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,760
We got divorced because of you!

1956
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,360
I have to lie to my
parents about everything.

1957
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,600
Then why did you divorce me!

1958
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,080
You should've had your dad disown you.

1959
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,320
That was a choice too, right?

1960
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,840
It wasn't a choice, Somya!
You know that.

1961
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,920
And getting divorced
was an easy choice, huh?

1962
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,680
That's who you are on the inside.

1963
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,240
You change as soon as you learn
the situation is not in your favor.

1964
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,040
You care about what other people make,

1965
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,480
but you don't care about your own wife!

1966
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,400
I've been apologizing to people
just to make your dream come true!

1967
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,080
Do you have any idea
how much money I've borrowed?

1968
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:25,960
Hello!

1969
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,560
You're not the only
one who borrowed money!

1970
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:29,440
I had to take an advance
from the coaching center.

1971
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:31,480
I sold all my jewelry,
including my wedding ring!

1972
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,840
You didn't do that as a favor to me!

1973
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,440
You did that because you were
desperate for a house of your own.

1974
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,800
Oh Kapil,
your Chi energy is beyond fixing!

1975
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:38,920
Chi... screw the Chi!

1976
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,480
Chi can be chickweed for all I care!

1977
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,560
Don't make me start
or I'll strip you bare!

1978
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,800
What are you going to say, huh?

1979
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,000
You are a crazy!

1980
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,360
You couldn't even afford
to buy two sodas at once!

1981
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,440
You know what, Kapil?

1982
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,160
That's only what you're good at.

1983
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,720
You want to talk about
what I'm good at, huh?

1984
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,800
Listen now.

1985
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,440
The day I ride my bike into
the market and leave tire marks,

1986
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:57,640
I'll have girls lining
up to be with me, got it?

1987
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,320
You'll ruin their lives too!

1988
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,880
I made a mistake marrying you!

1989
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,280
I'm the one who got trapped

1990
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:05,480
because of your dream house
that you wanted at any cost!

1991
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,600
I did want a house,
Kapil, but I wanted it for us.

1992
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,400
For both of us.

1993
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,720
But you won't get it.

1994
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,760
I won't get it?
I won't get it?!

1995
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,880
You're just like your family,
always causing a scene!

1996
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:16,760
So go ahead and make a scene!

1997
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,440
I'm done, Mr. Dubey.

1998
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:19,520
I'm so done.

1999
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,760
You're done?

2000
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,280
- Yeah, Somya?
- Bro.

2001
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:25,640
- Bro, she's pretty upset.
- You're done, huh, Somya?

2002
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:27,080
Listen to me and leave.

2003
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,080
Who asked for your advice, huh?

2004
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,840
A few more punches and
you might learn a lesson.

2005
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,640
You're so fake, bro.

2006
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,000
You had a fake wedding, you lie,

2007
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,880
and I'm the one who
needs to learn a lesson?

2008
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,320
Good going, bro.

2009
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,160
If hitting me solves your problem,
go ahead and do it.

2010
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,920
"Either leave me with hope"

2011
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,560
"That you'll come back,"

2012
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,200
"Either leave me with hope"

2013
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:46,920
"That you'll come back,"

2014
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,840
"Or set me ablaze"

2015
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:57,040
"As you walk away."

2016
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,160
"The bond we share,"

2017
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,680
"A love so rare,"

2018
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,960
"Soon to be shattered,
it's hard to bear,"

2019
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,840
"They search everywhere,"

2020
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,040
"My eyes in despair, "

2021
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,360
"Oh, my soul mate, how is this fair?"

2022
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:25,640
"You were the one
I left the world behind for,"

2023
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:30,680
"You were the one
I left the world behind for,"

2024
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,960
"Hold on to my hand, don't let it go,"

2025
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,120
"Together we shared"

2026
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:43,160
"Everything of ours."

2027
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,120
"Our days and nights,
together we shared,"

2028
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,480
"Together we shared,"

2029
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:58,520
"Everything of ours."

2030
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,160
"Our joys and tears,
together we shared,"

2031
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,480
'According to our sources,'

2032
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,520
'the reason behind postponing the
allotment of the Public House Scheme'

2033
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:17,120
'is that the government is actually
reconsidering the whole plan.'

2034
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:26,040
"Wiping tears behind closed doors,"

2035
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:30,880
"I will not miss you anymore!"

2036
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:36,280
"Life will go on, they say,"

2037
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:41,800
"But it'll never be the same,
not in any way."

2038
01:43:42,200 --> 01:43:47,400
"Even without the love of my life,"

2039
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,560
"Even without the love of my life,"

2040
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:56,960
"I'll try to move on, try to survive,"

2041
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:02,720
"Together we shared,"

2042
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,960
"Everything of ours."

2043
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:12,360
"Our joys and tears,
together we shared,"

2044
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:18,440
That was someone's house!

2045
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,640
Chill! They can just build another one.

2046
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,440
That was someone's house!
Don't you get it?

2047
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,680
"That you'll come back,"

2048
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,840
"Or set me ablaze"

2049
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:35,720
"As you walk away."

2050
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:40,960
"As you walk away."

2051
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:50,320
Sign over here.

2052
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,640
Somu, who was at the door?

2053
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,760
What is it?

2054
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,680
The allotment letter for the house.

2055
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,840
House?

2056
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,280
Which house?

2057
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:27,320
I applied for the Public Housing Scheme.

2058
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,600
Public...

2059
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,400
Has anyone seen my magnifying glass?

2060
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,400
Forget the magnifying glass!

2061
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:36,960
She just won the housing lottery.

2062
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:37,960
She got a house!

2063
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:38,880
She won the lottery for the house?

2064
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,720
- Oh, my baby!
- Let me have a look.

2065
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,560
Public Housing Scheme...

2066
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:47,520
That's great!

2067
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,720
This is amazing! You're amazing!

2068
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,960
- You won the housing lottery!
- Congratulations, hubby.

2069
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:53,640
Heartiest congratulations, hubby.

2070
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,120
Thank you, God.

2071
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,280
Look at her photo.
She's looking so beautiful.

2072
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,640
Yes, look at her photo.
I knew my kid was smart.

2073
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,880
Very smart.

2074
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,320
- She's our kid, after all.
- But when did she even apply?

2075
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:02,920
I didn't even know.
This is amazing!

2076
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,680
Sister-in-law
Thank you, God!

2077
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,560
Listen, let see the house.

2078
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,600
It's beautiful!

2079
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,040
Congratulation! Congratulation!

2080
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:25,680
Congratulation!

2081
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:26,840
Congratulation, Somu.

2082
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,080
We got the keys!

2083
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:31,000
We'll put the L-shaped
couch over here.

2084
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:33,240
And the chandelier light.

2085
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:48,600
That's why I keep
insisting that you rest.

2086
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,520
You need to relax
and not work all the time.

2087
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,680
Stay blessed. Hello.

2088
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:58,880
Somya, my child...

2089
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,000
What do you want now?

2090
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,760
Is this the way to talk to your wife?

2091
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,880
Well, she's not technically
his wife anymore, Brother-in-law.

2092
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,000
Keys to the house.

2093
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,640
You had a spare key with you?

2094
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,760
No, we don't have extra keys like that.

2095
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,960
You have one,
I have one, and Kapil has the other.

2096
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,120
She probably has a copy with her.

2097
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,680
That's why she's here to give it back.

2098
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,640
Uh, these aren't the keys to this house.

2099
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,720
What?

2100
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,280
There you go!

2101
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,080
They went behind their parents'
backs and bought a new house!

2102
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:44,040
Son, you should have let us
know you wanted to live separately.

2103
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,520
We wouldn't have had a problem with it.

2104
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,640
Sister, what hurts the most is that

2105
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,880
they bought the house
after getting divorced.

2106
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,640
Don't you see,
that was her plan all along!

2107
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:00,520
She used Kapil's money to buy the house,
then bounced after getting divorced.

2108
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,400
Uh, Aunty, please be quiet.
You don't know anything.

2109
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,240
Right!

2110
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,480
Somya has done no such thing.

2111
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,680
Wait, so which house
are we talking about?

2112
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:07,880
I had applied for the
Public Housing Scheme.

2113
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:09,920
What?

2114
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,240
She won the lottery.

2115
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,800
It's golden!

2116
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,240
Are we talking about
a house or gold here?

2117
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:15,800
It's a house that's as good as gold.

2118
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,800
Really?

2119
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:17,960
How much does it weigh?

2120
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:20,000
What house are we talking about?

2121
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:22,120
What's going on here?
Will someone fill me in?

2122
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,400
We got divorced for this house

2123
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:27,640
so that Somya would
be eligible for the Scheme.

2124
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:28,720
- Wait, what?
- That's it.

2125
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:30,800
Did you guys even get divorced for real?

2126
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:35,720
Yes Mom, we did get divorced,
but only on paper.

2127
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,000
What you saw...

2128
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,680
What you saw...

2129
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:45,520
was just an act.

2130
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,040
An act?

2131
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:49,840
A fake divorce?

2132
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,760
Oh no, my child, what have you done?

2133
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,000
Sorry, Dad.

2134
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,440
I am so happy!

2135
01:50:00,120 --> 01:50:01,280
A fake divorce, huh!

2136
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,160
And you got a house too.

2137
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,720
That's good.

2138
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:09,640
But not everything that
glitters is gold, you know?

2139
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,560
This Punjabi girl shattered
our home to build her own house!

2140
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:15,440
She must be so happy right now!

2141
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:19,600
Sister, she'll only be happy
after she leaves this family.

2142
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:21,200
- Mom, come on!
- Sister...

2143
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,840
We can see her true colors now.

2144
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,200
So this is what Punjabis
teach their kids?

2145
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,240
Stop it, Uncle.

2146
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,880
Brother, tell that
guy to watch his manners

2147
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,240
- or I'll have to put him in his place.
- Calm down.

2148
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,240
You really think you can hit me?

2149
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:32,200
What makes you think I won't stop you?

2150
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,000
Stop it.

2151
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,400
You're in a priest's house.

2152
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:39,320
Don't be rude
or we will curse you.

2153
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,840
Like we care! We've dealt
with tons of priests like him!

2154
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,160
Priests like you take our
money and pray in our homes.

2155
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,720
- That's enough, Mom. Stop.
- It's all good, dear.

2156
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,800
Hey!

2157
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,160
You don't even have a house
to invite a priest to pray in!

2158
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,240
Cut it out, Aunty!

2159
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:54,240
I've had enough of your crap.

2160
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,640
Somya is right,

2161
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,160
you've just caused trouble
since you've gotten here.

2162
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,960
What are you saying, Kapil?

2163
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:02,720
- Dad!
- Kapil,

2164
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,280
don't talk to your aunt like that.

2165
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:05,320
Dad!

2166
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,760
Dad... Mom!

2167
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:08,200
Deepa!

2168
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,840
Deepa! Deepa!

2169
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:12,000
- Open your eyes, Deepa!
- Deepa

2170
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:13,680
Looks like an epilepsy attack.
Make her smell an onion or something.

2171
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:14,440
Shut up!

2172
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,200
We need to get her to the hospital.
Does anyone have a car?

2173
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:18,360
- Puru!
- I have a car.

2174
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:19,720
- Puru, there's no need to panic!
- It's parked right outside.

2175
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,760
Wake up, Deepa.

2176
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:21,960
- I have a car.
- Be careful.

2177
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,080
You don't get it, ma'am.
She's never been on her own.

2178
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,000
- She's never been without me.
- Sir...

2179
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,640
I'll just sit on
the side and keep quiet.

2180
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:34,480
Sir, please leave the room.

2181
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,680
- I'll just sit on the side and keep quiet.
- Sir, please leave the room.

2182
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:37,640
Please don't disturb us.

2183
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:38,520
- It's okay, It's okay.
- We'll call you. Okay.

2184
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,040
- Uncle, please come with me.
- I'll just sit on the side and keep quiet.

2185
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:41,080
- Sir, please.
- Uncle, just come with me.

2186
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,520
She's not used to being alone.

2187
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:43,840
- She's going to worry.
- It's okay.

2188
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,880
She just passed out.

2189
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:45,800
Maybe her sugar or
blood pressure dropped.

2190
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,360
When she wakes up and
doesn't see me around...

2191
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,640
Just sit with me for a bit.

2192
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,800
- He doesn't understand.
- Puru, she's going to be alright.

2193
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,960
She will be absolutely fine.

2194
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,920
Sit down.

2195
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,880
- Sit down and relax.
- Sit.

2196
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,280
Sit down, I'll go check on her.

2197
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:56,320
Okay.

2198
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:57,800
God willing, everything will be fine.

2199
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,360
Brother-in-law, you don't get it.

2200
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,640
She's going to worry when she wakes up
and doesn't see me around.

2201
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:02,960
She'll get well soon.

2202
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:04,960
- She'll be fine, Puru.
- Uncle...

2203
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:13,400
Doctor...

2204
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,160
Mr. Purshottam, did you find
a donor for her liver transplant?

2205
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,720
Transplant?

2206
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,880
70% of her liver is
damaged due to cirrhosis.

2207
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:26,160
What?

2208
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,480
We have to do a transplant,
Mr. Purshottam.

2209
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,200
It's the only way to save her life.

2210
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:40,720
Purshottam, what is the doctor saying?

2211
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:41,960
When did this happen?

2212
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:45,240
Uncle, we are not that useless

2213
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,280
for you not to keep us
in the loop on her condition.

2214
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:51,360
Purshottam, what's the
point of having family

2215
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:53,280
if they can't help
you out when you need it?

2216
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:55,240
Brother-in-law,

2217
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,840
I couldn't...

2218
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,240
bring myself to ask anyone for help.

2219
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,320
Puru?

2220
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,840
You could've told me at least.

2221
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:11,560
What would have I told you, Sister?

2222
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:13,360
What was I supposed to say?

2223
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:17,880
We had to sell our house for one
and a half years of treatment.

2224
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:23,160
That's why we lied and stayed with you.

2225
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,120
Kapil and Somya have their own problems.

2226
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,600
What was I supposed to say to anyone?

2227
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,520
You sold your ancestral house
to pay for her medical bills?

2228
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,280
What's a home, Sister?

2229
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:49,200
A home is not just bricks and walls.

2230
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,720
That's just a house.

2231
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:02,440
It's the people who make it a home.

2232
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:08,760
And... she's my home.

2233
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:16,520
If I can't save her,
what's the point of having a home?

2234
01:54:18,160 --> 01:54:22,280
- Puru... calm down, Puru.
- She means everything.

2235
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,040
She'll be fine, Uncle.

2236
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:27,120
Uncle, go sit with Aunty.

2237
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:28,200
- Come on.
- Come on.

2238
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,160
- Come on, let's go see her.
- Come on.

2239
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,200
She's been with me
through thick and thin.

2240
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,480
Don't cry in front of her, Uncle.

2241
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,120
Nothing is going to happen to Aunty.

2242
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,960
She'll be fine.

2243
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,840
I won't let anything happen to you.

2244
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,640
You'll be fine.

2245
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,440
I'll do whatever it takes, Deepa,

2246
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:09,680
but I won't let anything happen to you.

2247
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:10,880
Are you listening to me, Deepa?

2248
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,480
Are you listening?

2249
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,160
Deepa...

2250
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,640
Please don't leave me.

2251
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,800
What have we done, Kapu!

2252
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:38,560
Uncle and Aunty were facing
such a dreadful situation and we...

2253
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,640
We were so wrong to
misjudge their situation.

2254
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,680
Uncle sold his house for Aunty.

2255
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,320
And we...

2256
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:58,800
And we let a stupid
house ruin our relationship.

2257
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,720
Kapu, you should have fought with me,
argued with me, or even scolded me.

2258
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:07,240
You should have stopped talking
to me for a couple of days.

2259
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,360
Why did you agree to divorce me?

2260
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,400
I wanted to be with you,
even if it meant being apart.

2261
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:25,080
That house mattered to you,
and your happiness matters to me.

2262
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:28,280
So I did what was... what was necessary.

2263
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,760
Somya, you think I am stingy, right?

2264
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,880
Yes, I am stingy.

2265
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:42,040
But I can't help it.

2266
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:43,800
I've been cash-strapped
since forever,

2267
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:49,000
so I automatically learned to save.

2268
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:54,040
I haggled over veggies,
paid 17 instead of 20,

2269
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,160
or 15 instead of 17.

2270
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:56,880
And I'm not the only one.

2271
01:57:58,160 --> 01:58:00,560
Millions of people do it.

2272
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:08,040
We save from our everyday
lives for our future.

2273
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:12,920
We make small sacrifices every day.

2274
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,040
But when you came into my life,

2275
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:24,480
I felt like I was saving it all for you.

2276
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:36,080
You love 5-Star chocolates,
so I buy them for you.

2277
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:41,920
And I'll never buy two sodas at once,

2278
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,240
because your drink always tastes better.

2279
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,040
I like Kapu instead
of Kapil because it's short

2280
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,200
and it makes me feel more loved.

2281
01:58:58,280 --> 01:58:59,480
Why would I want to divorce you?

2282
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:00,600
Tell me!

2283
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:04,080
Silly, just looking
at you makes me all excited.

2284
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,280
That's how much I love you.

2285
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:06,720
I feel all warm and fussy inside.

2286
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:15,000
I wanted to give you a better future,
and that's why...

2287
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:18,640
Kapu...

2288
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:19,920
Kapu...

2289
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,400
I don't want a better future.

2290
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:27,840
I want what we have right now.

2291
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:31,160
Our present.

2292
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,240
Sorry, Kapu.

2293
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:42,640
No, I'm sorry, Somya.
Sorry.

2294
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,160
- I'm sorry.
- I messed up.

2295
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:47,520
I messed up, Kapu.

2296
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,800
No, no,...

2297
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:52,440
I don't want that house.

2298
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,520
I don't want that house, Kapu.

2299
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,960
I don't want to take
someone else's house.

2300
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:05,640
Even I don't want the house
that ruined our relationship.

2301
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,920
I don't want it either.

2302
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,840
Sorry, Kapu.

2303
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:26,840
Bro...

2304
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,840
This house...

2305
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,960
Bro, is it even legal?

2306
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,800
Yes, Brother.

2307
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,400
It's provided by the government

2308
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:39,680
with all the legal documents.

2309
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,760
But why give it to me?

2310
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:47,360
Consider it our way of making up.

2311
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:52,640
But How will I pay for it?

2312
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,160
It's a government scheme.

2313
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:55,920
You'll get a loan with payment options.

2314
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:00,520
Look, you and your
wife are both earning,

2315
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,960
so you can handle the instalments

2316
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:04,760
just like you handle paying
for your daughter's education.

2317
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,400
I'll fill you in on the details.
Don't worry.

2318
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:19,840
What documents do I need to provide?

2319
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:23,800
Do you have an Aadhar Card?

2320
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,840
That's all you need.

2321
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:31,520
This house... this house is mine?

2322
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,040
It's yours to keep, Mr. Daroga.

2323
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:36,160
Thank you, Brother!

2324
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:44,440
Sister...

2325
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:46,560
Brother...

2326
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,160
Hang on, I'll be right back.

2327
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Daroga, listen...

2328
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:58,560
I had given them
a minimum guarantee cheque.

2329
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,520
Please repay that back to me if you can?

2330
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:05,040
Don't worry.
There's no rush, take your time but...

2331
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,640
Let's go.

2332
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:35,080
"For you, I will get the moon,"

2333
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:39,320
"I will get a handful
of the stars along too,"

2334
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:44,280
You're falling for her trap again?

2335
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,640
Aunty!

2336
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:50,120
She's going to talk you
into doing what she wants!

2337
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,640
Right!

2338
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:58,320
- Kapil!
- What?

2339
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,640
This is not fair!

2340
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:01,960
- What?
- That!

2341
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,360
"A troublemaker mister, you'll see,"

2342
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:11,200
"So be cautious lest
you fall
