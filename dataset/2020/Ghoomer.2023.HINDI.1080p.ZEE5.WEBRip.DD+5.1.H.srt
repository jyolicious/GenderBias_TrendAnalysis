1
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,560
"Let's dance, baby..."

2
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
Bro, stop...

3
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
Stop.

4
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,080
What a lucky umpire.

5
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,360
I swear, man.

6
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,160
She'll look so good running
in slow motion...

7
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,200
No wonder women's cricket is so popular.

8
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,760
Play with us too, madam.

9
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,200
Let us bat...

10
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
on your pitch!

11
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,800
Hi.

12
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,080
- She's mine.
- No, mine.

13
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
Bro...

14
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,120
Bro.

15
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Sorry guys, women power
is on the rise.

16
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,280
If you hit on us,
we'll have to hit back.

17
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
Next time, wear a helmet
and watch.

18
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,560
Let's go.

19
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,520
Ani...

20
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,720
When you fall sick...

21
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,600
what will you eat?

22
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Opposite case...

23
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
she'll eat butter chicken then.

24
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,880
What do stock market players know
about fitness!

25
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,640
- Pull your paunch in.
- Granny!

26
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
Hot hot 'parathas'...

27
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
Niku, get a DNA test done for these two.

28
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,880
They can't be my grandsons.

29
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,680
Two more.

30
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Let them eat, Granny.

31
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
There's just a one letter difference
between fitness and fatness.

32
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,880
And they are fatness freaks.

33
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,120
How was the match, Ani?

34
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,960
104 runs in 83 balls.
We won by 8 wickets!

35
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
You're the best.

36
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,600
You know, Chris Gayle scored a century
in only 30 balls.

37
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,520
Even my mutual funds have matured...

38
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,560
when will you?

39
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Tishu, that was a T20 game.

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,520
Ani played a one-day match.

41
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,520
In a 50 over game
one has to play 50 overs.

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Special forces act perpendicular
to the surface

43
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,520
and the formula is -

44
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,120
Force on the body is the
vector sum of the pressure

45
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,320
multiplied by the area
around the body.

46
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,960
What's the score?

47
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
Sorry, sir...

48
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,240
What's the score?

49
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
It's... 118 for 8.

50
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,360
English conditions...

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,440
swinging ball... they can't play.

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,840
- Who took the wickets?
- Joe Root.

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
Can't even play spin bowling!

54
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,760
- I tell you, if we had --
- Sir...

55
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
Sir, can we please get back to Physics?

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,840
We've half an hour of class left...

57
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
please watch the match after that.

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Anina, you're a cricketer but
you have no interest in cricket?

59
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm interested in cricket, sir...
that's why I'm studying Physics.

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
Ball trajectories are based
on the dynamics of a moving object

61
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,440
and the effect of atmospheric pressure

62
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
and thrust force on a rotating
spherical object...

63
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,440
Please teach me Physics, sir
so I can play spin and swing better.

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,240
Head position is so perfect.

65
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,200
So technically perfect, yet...

66
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,360
her strike rate is always above 120.

67
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,280
I think she's ready to play for India.

68
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,600
Let her play for the state first.

69
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,160
If you ring the bell so loudly,
how will God hear your prayers?

70
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,360
'Some spinach leaves... adding
some mint for a nice, cooling effect.'

71
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,480
'Some ginger...'

72
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,240
'Lemon juice, few celery sticks...'

73
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,560
Ani, your omelette is getting cold.

74
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,400
Concentration-booster smoothie.

75
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
To help you focus.

76
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Formula 1 racer Lewis Hamilton
also drinks this formula.

77
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Ani...

78
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,160
One minute...
let me first call an ambulance.

79
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,840
Call... someone's about to have
a heart attack.

80
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,480
Eat eat...

81
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
This is readily available in England.

82
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,760
England?

83
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,520
Today, the list of 24 probables
for the English tour will be announced.

84
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,000
Chill, Granny.

85
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
I've just started playing state-level.
There's still time.

86
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Mr Morey - the selector,
was watching.

87
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,080
When you raised your bat
on scoring 50,

88
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,680
he applauded the most.

89
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,880
David Warner, without ever playing
state-level matches...

90
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,400
was selected directly
for the Australian team.

91
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
Times have changed.

92
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,800
The world of cricket is hungry
for special talent.

93
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,480
A piece of professional advice...

94
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Concentrate on your concentration.

95
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,640
Why do you get so excited
when you see a spinner?

96
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
T20 generation!

97
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,680
Cheers!

98
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,880
"My heart spins like a wheel"

99
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,880
"Spinning all around you"

100
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,040
"My heart spins like a reel"

101
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,240
"Spinning even when it's cut loose"

102
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,960
"My heart searches for you..."

103
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,320
"Spinning around your neighbourhood"

104
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,680
"My heart follows you,
wagging its tail"

105
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,240
"My heart follows you,
wagging its tail"

106
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,680
"My heart follows you around,
wagging its tail"

107
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Isn't this your grandpa's car?

108
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
It was. I pocketed it
after he popped it.

109
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,120
I missed you, Ani.

110
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,680
Life is so strange...

111
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
As kids, we spent every day together

112
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
then suddenly life takes over

113
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,280
and we go our different ways.

114
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,720
And then one day,

115
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,280
suddenly we meet again.

116
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,480
Feels like we've been meeting every day.

117
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,000
Really?

118
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,680
Stop the car.

119
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,680
What!

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,200
What are you doing?

121
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,960
Ani, you're spoiling my hair!

122
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,400
Is this how you behave?

123
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,720
What's going on?
Hitting a girl?

124
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,560
The girl is hitting me, man!

125
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,480
- Did I ask you for help?
- Crazy girl...

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,240
Were you in a coma all these years,
you rascal?

127
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,760
You'd follow me around
like a puppy every day

128
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,360
then you showed your true colors
after moving to USA, you dog.

129
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,560
Ani...

130
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,280
Had to check out my options in USA.

131
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,720
Now it feels like we've been meeting
every day!

132
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,800
How long are you here for?

133
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
As long as I'm alive!

134
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,280
Want me to drag you in?

135
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,520
Hello?

136
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,160
Yes sir, this is Anina.

137
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
Thank you, sir.

138
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Yes, sir.

139
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,560
Granny...

140
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Dad!

141
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,720
I made it.

142
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,920
I made it to the Indian team
probables for the England tour.

143
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,440
I am so proud of you.

144
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,000
Granny...

145
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,480
Don't cry, it's time to make
the opposition cry.

146
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
I've fully analyzed the English bowlers.

147
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,520
Their spinning department is weak.

148
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,680
Their biggest advantage is the weather.

149
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
Average seamers become
as good as Wasim and Waqar.

150
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,480
Bless you.

151
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,760
And who are you?

152
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,920
Remember Jeet, Granny?

153
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,040
Puppy love still following you around?

154
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,640
Come.

155
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,880
Give me your hand, Ani.

156
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,120
What is this?

157
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,440
Superstition.

158
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,880
I've been praying for three months now

159
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,640
that's why she has been selected.

160
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,040
This sacred thread is more powerful
than a bat.

161
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,480
You'll see, she'll score a century
in her very first match!

162
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,480
For that, I have to be selected
in the team first.

163
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
This is only a list
of the probables.

164
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,400
I don't know if I'll make it
to the 16.

165
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,360
- I don't believe in all this rubbish.
- I believe in it.

166
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Bribing a God for his daughter!

167
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Mohinder Amarnath always kept
a red handkerchief

168
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,880
in his pocket, while batting.

169
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,120
And 'Dada'... Sourav Ganguly...

170
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
would keep his guru's photo
in his pocket.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,160
Sachin... always wore
his left pad first.

172
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,680
Legends and superstition
seem to be made for each other.

173
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
G.R. Vishwanath?

174
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,360
India's real legend, who played
before you were even born.

175
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,160
To face Andy Roberts without a helmet,
you need self-belief

176
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
not superstition!

177
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,400
Keep it on only if you score a 100.

178
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,040
- You?
- Hello, Uncle... Jeet. Remember me?

179
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
Jeet?

180
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
Didn't Ani break your teeth once?

181
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,400
Ma'am is here.

182
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,880
I'm so sorry. Too much traffic.

183
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,640
Don't apologize, ma'am.

184
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,800
The Chairman of Selectors can be late.

185
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:34,920
Hello.

186
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,800
Coach, after the 15-day camp...
what's your feeling?

187
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,560
Who's fit? Who isn't?

188
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,480
Tell us and make our jobs easier.

189
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,120
Sorry, ma'am, all the girls
are super fit.

190
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,880
So, it's going to be a long day.

191
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
It's my job to make your job difficult.

192
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,680
All of them are good enough
to be in the final 16.

193
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,680
Let's begin.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
She has so much time...

195
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,520
plays the ball so late.

196
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,160
She'll do well in English conditions.

197
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,080
Who is he?
Why is he on the field?

198
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,160
Ma'am, that's Paddy sir.

199
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
Padam Singh Sodhi.

200
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,040
He played a Test match
in the 90s.

201
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
But what is he doing here?

202
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,840
Please tell him, team selection
is going on. He can't be there.

203
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,280
Hello... you are?

204
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,720
Anina.

205
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,920
And you, sir?

206
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,480
You don't know who I am?

207
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,640
Shame.

208
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm thirsty...

209
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,360
The thirst to play.

210
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,520
- Is that working?
- What, sir?

211
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,840
Sir, that's just--

212
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,240
It's a beautiful morning for cricket.

213
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,160
Sir, sir...

214
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,840
One ball. Just one ball.

215
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,720
Sir, selections are going on...

216
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,040
Sure... I didn't think
elections are going on.

217
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,440
Let me bowl one ball.

218
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
Seeing this amazing
batswoman play

219
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,920
I felt like bowling, after 20 years.

220
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,320
After all, the greatest motivation
for a bowler is a good batsman.

221
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,680
Just... one ball.

222
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,440
Sir, you'll have to leave.

223
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,160
You'll have to leave now.

224
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,520
Come.

225
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,800
Sir!

226
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,000
What is he doing there?

227
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,360
Please get him out.

228
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,960
Sorry. Not ready.

229
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,360
Batswoman not ready, sir.
Dead ball.

230
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,160
One more.

231
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,760
Sir... you are disturbing our players.

232
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,000
- Please leave or else--
- Or else what?

233
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,640
You'll throw me out
and I'll be okay with it?

234
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,840
See, boss...

235
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,680
It's Happy Hour at the Club bar.

236
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
I ordered two large drinks and downed
four before coming here.

237
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,880
There will be a scuffle...

238
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,360
anything may happen...

239
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,800
to me.

240
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,960
Then you'll have to call an ambulance

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
there'll be a lot of drama.

242
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
The selectors' time will be wasted.

243
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,120
Just one ball. Two minutes.

244
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm a spinner...
won't even need a run up.

245
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,760
One ball, please.

246
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,280
Coach sir...

247
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,080
He's a senior player, sir.

248
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,200
Just one ball...

249
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
What are you saying?
Selections are going on.

250
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,280
Girls are playing. This is not okay.

251
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
He'll bowl one delivery and leave.

252
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
Please, sir. One ball.

253
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,720
Just one ball.

254
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,280
Thank you, my friend.

255
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,680
Hello.

256
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,280
Ready?

257
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,840
Sir...

258
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
One more ball, please... sir.

259
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,840
- Anina.
- Please, sir.

260
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Was it a no-ball?

261
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
No, right?

262
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,760
Why should I bowl again?

263
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,320
Lady with the sacred thread!

264
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,920
In cricket, when you're out...

265
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,280
you have to go out!

266
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,240
What is happening?

267
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,800
Selection is happening, ma'am.

268
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,040
This girl... no!

269
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,600
Hello, Mr Padam.

270
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,160
You are?

271
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,920
Rumi Vakeel, Chairman
of the selection committee.

272
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,160
Get up from your chair...

273
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and bowl.

274
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,600
You can gauge a batsman
in two minutes.

275
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
Things are deceptive from a distance.

276
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,440
All of you... bowl a ball each.

277
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,920
Once you're done,
meet me at the bar.

278
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,520
Happy Hour is on.

279
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,600
I'll teach you how to select...

280
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
the world's greatest whisky.

281
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
Use your common sense

282
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,000
young girls are playing.

283
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,040
If you can't shut the club,
shut the bar at least!

284
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,320
Every frustrated, failed cricketer
is given membership here.

285
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
What do you expect?

286
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,400
Girls, I'm sorry for the interruption.

287
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,040
We'll carry on with the selection.
All right?

288
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't let this affect you.

289
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,280
What does Happy Hour mean?

290
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Buy 1 get 1 free.

291
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,360
So where is it?

292
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,000
Right here, sir.

293
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,800
This is free with this one.

294
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,800
And with this one?

295
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,560
This is free with this one, sir.

296
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
This is free with this one.

297
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,880
And with this one?

298
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,040
Sir--

299
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,960
This is a drink.
Where's the free one with this?

300
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,920
Here. Free.

301
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,240
- Rules are rules.
- Yeah.

302
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,760
And the free one with this?

303
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,800
Paddy brother...

304
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,960
wake up, it's 2 p.m.

305
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,520
Your tea will get cold
and then you'll say...

306
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
puckall tea!

307
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,680
First words in the morning
must be nice, Rasika.

308
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,640
It's not P... it's F... F!

309
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,280
Irritating!

310
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,440
- I don't want to eat.
- You have to!

311
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,760
- Why do I have to?
- If you don't, then--

312
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,520
Then what? I'll die?

313
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,800
How does it matter to you?

314
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,760
You won't, I will die.

315
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,520
What?

316
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,240
If you're hungry...
you'll go and chew somebody's brain

317
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,520
that brainless person will vote
for the wrong political party

318
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,800
and the rights of people like me
will become 'wrong' again!

319
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,840
Because of these two eggs
my life will be fried!

320
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
So it's me who'll die, right?

321
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
Why on earth did I adopt you
as my sister?

322
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,960
And drink a little less...

323
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,360
or else you'll die too!

324
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,160
Drinking and dying

325
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,720
is better than not drinking and dying.

326
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,160
If there is less alcohol in the body
when dying

327
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,880
a lot of wood will be needed
for cremating it.

328
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,600
Many trees will need to be cut

329
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,160
there will be global warming.

330
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,560
So, in order to protect Mother Nature
and her children

331
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,920
at the time of death

332
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,120
the body should be full of alcohol.

333
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,640
Just one strike of a match...

334
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,600
Boom!

335
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040
Eco-friendly last rites!

336
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,840
What a puckall thought!

337
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,120
Your daughter has become
an Indian cricketer!

338
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,600
See the miracle of the sacred thread!

339
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,760
Not even one warm-up match?

340
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,800
What is this planning
by the Cricket Board!

341
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Straightaway 5 one-day matches
and 2 T20s.

342
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,600
Hello...

343
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,760
Hello... Mama-ji!

344
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,640
Ani has been selected
to play for India!!!

345
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,960
No match at Lord's?

346
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,760
Men play so many matches
at Lord's,

347
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
why can't women get one!

348
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,520
Hello Chacha-ji, Ani has been selected
to play for India.

349
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,880
The whole world is going on
about equality,

350
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,280
these chaps at Lord's are stuck
in the Lord Mountbatten era!

351
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,560
Why would she play for England?
She will play for India.

352
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,880
What is Bedford-shyre... Derby-shyre...

353
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,680
- Buckingham-shyre...
- Shire.

354
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,680
Bedfordshire.

355
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,760
Derbyshire.

356
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,000
Where else are the matches?

357
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,320
Why? Want to book a double-room
in all these places?

358
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,320
Aunty...

359
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,240
Papa, how many relatives
will you broadcast this to?

360
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
Not ticket... cricket!

361
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,760
Hello...

362
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,960
Hello...

363
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,120
Sit down.

364
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
- Or you'll lose your voice.
- Aunty...

365
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,040
I understand a father's pride

366
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,520
but this over-enthusiastic publicity

367
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,760
can pressurize my player.

368
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,160
The pressure of making
every family member proud

369
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,000
can end up with her disappointing India!

370
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Two butter 'naans'.

371
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,600
Is Jos Butler married?

372
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,800
- I don't know.
- Google it.

373
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,880
What if she and Jos have an affair
in England?

374
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,480
You're single, aren't you, Granny?

375
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,120
Go on. Kill me.

376
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,880
Here.

377
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,920
Who'll say thank you?

378
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,520
Sir, you can't go inside.

379
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,960
I'm a life member...
As long as I am living, I can.

380
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,360
The women's team farewell dinner
is on.

381
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,400
So, let it.

382
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,600
I won't be eating off their plates!

383
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,960
Sir, actually the club is closed today.

384
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,960
Call the management.

385
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
This is by order of the management, sir.

386
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,040
Who is the management to stop me!

387
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,240
This club is for cricketers
and I am a Test cricketer!

388
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,200
I will throw the management out!

389
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,920
Sir... please don't create
a scene today.

390
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,560
There are ladies inside...
tomorrow onwards, the club is all yours.

391
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,760
Sir, please...

392
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,920
Don't... please, sir.

393
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,720
Don't do what?

394
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
What have I done?

395
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
Seeing kids playing gully cricket...

396
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,840
don't grown ups feel like
bowling a ball or two?

397
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,200
Kids should be happy
that a Test cricketer bowled to them.

398
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
Show some bloody respect!

399
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,160
Sir, we do respect you...

400
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
but you are making the girls
feel uncomfortable.

401
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,080
Girls, am I 'uncomforting' you?

402
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,960
Lady with the sacred thread,
you got selected?

403
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,240
How?

404
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,320
Did you get someone high up
to make a call?

405
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,240
Or did you bribe someone?

406
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
Because you certainly don't deserve
to be here.

407
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,240
I love how this system works!

408
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,480
A player who can't face a single ball...

409
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,800
is being fed 'biryani'
and taken to England.

410
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
And the one who took her wicket

411
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,040
isn't even being allowed
to go to the bar.

412
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,320
I will not leave without my drink!

413
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,200
Sir, one more word against my players...

414
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,440
and there'll be no one worse than me.

415
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,400
No one can be worse than you.

416
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,640
You've picked a third-class cricketer
for the team

417
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,280
to bring shame to the nation.

418
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,080
Are you a coach or a cockroach?

419
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,280
You've picked garbage...

420
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,760
hand-picked it.

421
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,680
I just want to...

422
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,320
I just want to kill
that son of a...!

423
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,120
Forget that fool.

424
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
Ani, focus on England.

425
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,000
You're leaving day after.

426
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,960
What if he's right?

427
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,160
What!

428
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,840
What if I really am
a third-class batter?

429
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,480
Ani, are you crazy?

430
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,560
You're the next superstar
of women's cricket.

431
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,040
Whose wicket can be taken...

432
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,480
by even a drunk, unfit,
retired male bowler.

433
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,800
Fluke, Ani.
It was a fluke.

434
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,800
If he bowled another ball,

435
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,520
it would be game over for him!

436
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,800
You can play Jimmy Anderson
better than our male players.

437
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,240
So, come on, cheer up.

438
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,760
Cover your ears.

439
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
- Why?
- I said, cover your ears.

440
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
I am driving... how can I?

441
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,320
Okay, done.

442
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,800
Done?

443
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Don't stop. Call him more names.

444
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,920
Shut up.

445
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,720
You should wear a helmet while playing.

446
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,960
Why?

447
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,520
How will people focus
on your batting?

448
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
Who do you think you are,
flirting with an Indian cricketer?

449
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,280
Who should I be?

450
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,200
At least somebody who can afford
to buy a small new car.

451
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,760
I sold my company for 20 million dollars
in the US.

452
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,720
20 million dollars?

453
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,880
Then why the hell are you driving
this piece of junk?

454
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,720
It's the safest car in the world...

455
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
doesn't go faster than 30 kmph.

456
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,000
The wiper moves when I want to start
the indicator.

457
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,880
What do I use to start the indicator?

458
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,120
This.

459
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
How is Ani?

460
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,720
She has lost a lot of blood.

461
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,320
Her right hand took the whole impact
of the accident.

462
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,760
Bones and tissues
have been severely damaged.

463
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,480
Nerves have been completely destroyed.

464
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,760
- We had to do a closed amputation.
- Amputa--

465
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,120
Sorry, we tried our best but
we could not save her right arm.

466
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Fortunately, there is no head injury
or any other serious injuries.

467
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
She'll be fine.

468
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
- What!
- 'Yes, ma'am.'

469
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,760
My god.

470
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
'How did it happen?'

471
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,480
When did it happen?

472
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,920
Last night.

473
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,520
She's at Maxx Hospital.

474
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,200
How many men did this?

475
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,600
What?

476
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,360
Hurts a lot?

477
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Want to pee?

478
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,280
- No.
- Then why are you getting up?

479
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
I'll change the dressing.

480
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,160
What a pretty nose.

481
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,360
Have to ward off the evil eye.

482
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,040
My brothers too spared your whole face
and smashed just your nose.

483
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,560
Keep quiet or else
I'll break your nose too!

484
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,760
What did you say?

485
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,240
You'll hit a woman?

486
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,120
You were better as a man.

487
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,080
You did your work quietly...

488
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
now all you do is blabber!

489
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,080
Yeah right!

490
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
Dragging home a 90 kg man
from the car, in the middle of the night

491
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,800
applying bandage

492
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,600
changing the pants
of an unconscious body

493
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,720
cleaning vomit off the carpet...
staying up all night

494
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,640
is hardly any work!

495
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,640
Shut up.

496
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,160
I took it out of the washing machine...
just in time.

497
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,640
There'll be 7 missed calls.

498
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,960
How many times have I told you
not to check my phone.

499
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,960
Give my glasses.

500
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,760
Anger will inflame the wound.

501
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,280
I didn't check your phone...
I only called.

502
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,360
It's really very unfortunate...

503
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,200
but now, we have to look
for a replacement.

504
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,160
"These things called dreams"

505
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,320
"They think the world is theirs"

506
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,360
"This thing called hope"

507
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,160
"Is all airy fairy"

508
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,880
"This thing called aspiration"

509
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,120
"Flies without ever taking off"

510
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,720
"All these poetic thoughts"

511
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,000
"will end now that I'm here"

512
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,840
"Surrender to me"

513
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,040
"I'm the punctuation mark"

514
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,080
"Called the full stop"

515
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,440
"To put an abrupt end"

516
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,280
"Is my job"

517
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,160
"This life is my slave"

518
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,080
"I am the full stop"

519
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,560
"All this fake courage"

520
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,600
"Doesn't stand a chance"

521
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,680
"How will the story
of your dreams progress"

522
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,600
"When I'm present on every page"

523
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,440
"I hold the reins of time"

524
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,120
"Obey me, obey me, obey me"

525
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,640
"All these poetic thoughts"

526
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,360
"will end now that I'm here"

527
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,480
"I am just a small dot"

528
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,400
"I am the full stop"

529
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,960
"To put an abrupt end"

530
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,560
"Is my job"

531
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,720
This pain is called phantom pain.

532
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,440
It's felt in that part of the body,
which doesn't exist anymore.

533
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,480
It's a post-amputation phenomenon.

534
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,160
Her brain still thinks
that her right arm exists.

535
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,440
This sensation will slowly go away.

536
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,040
"I am the full stop"

537
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,040
I don't have the strength to hit you.

538
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,520
Feeling guilty?

539
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,080
Survivor's guilt?

540
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,320
I love you, Ani.

541
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,480
Wow!

542
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,600
You're so great, Jeet.

543
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Thank you.

544
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,840
I should touch your feet.

545
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,520
Let me touch your feet, Jeet.
Your feet, Jeet...

546
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,200
Give me your feet.

547
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,640
Give me your feet.
Please, give me your feet!

548
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,520
- Please, please give me your feet!
- Ani, just shut up.

549
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,480
You shut up!

550
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,080
You want to say 'I love you'
to a cripple and become a hero?

551
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,240
Got bored after earning
20 million dollars?

552
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,960
To have a new goal in life,
you want to take advantage of me?

553
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,400
What do you want?

554
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,640
You want me to applaud you all my life,
with one hand?

555
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,920
You want to feel bigger
than what you are

556
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,280
by making me feel smaller
than what I am?

557
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,120
Take your love and shove it up!

558
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,640
I want to die.

559
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,640
I want to die.

560
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,760
Do I wish you happy birthday
or happy last day?

561
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
How will you die?

562
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,400
By tying a rope to the fan?

563
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,000
Or by tying a bed sheet?

564
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,080
Tie...

565
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,040
Oh, but how will you tie with one hand?

566
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,840
Here you go.

567
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,000
Slash your wrist with this.

568
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,320
But to slash the wrist of one hand
you'll need the other hand.

569
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,960
Rat poison.

570
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,280
Phenyl?

571
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,080
But you might survive.

572
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,800
Hmm... tough tough!

573
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,440
How were you planning to die?

574
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,960
What are you doing here?

575
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,480
I came to wish you...
happy birthday.

576
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,920
You're feeling sorry for me too?

577
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
I can't believe this.

578
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,440
A crass drunkard who ridiculed me
till yesterday...

579
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,360
has given up his Happy Hour
to come wish me happy birthday!

580
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,040
Great!

581
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,280
Ani... all okay?

582
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,120
Dad, have you met this man?

583
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,120
Yes... while you were with Jeet,

584
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,360
we were chatting outside.

585
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,600
Mr Padam Singh Sodhi
was all praise for you.

586
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,080
And who will know better
than the Chairman of Selectors?

587
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,360
One more cup of coffee?

588
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,880
Yeah, sure.

589
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,400
- Let's make it Irish.
- Sure.

590
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,440
- And another slice of the cake.
- Right away.

591
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,320
Chairman of Selectors?

592
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,760
Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

593
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,000
What are you doing here?

594
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,760
You know...

595
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,280
when I was dropped from the team...

596
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,240
no one came to meet me to say -

597
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,880
'Don't worry, Paddy.
You'll play the next series.'

598
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,880
So I have come here to tell you...

599
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,160
Don't worry, Anina.

600
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,120
You'll definitely play the next series.

601
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Have you quit whiskey
and moved on to cocaine?

602
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,680
- Cake. Your coffee is just coming.
- Dad, ask this man to get out of here.

603
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,720
- What happened?
- Get him out of here, Dad!

604
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,640
- What happened?
- Nothing, sir. I just told her,

605
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,760
'You'll definitely play
the next series.'

606
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,080
And... she is saying, 'Get out!'

607
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,400
Don't know what I did wrong --

608
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,800
Don't know, is it?
You don't know?

609
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,840
You are the one who cut off my hand.

610
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,360
If you hadn't insulted me
in front of my team,

611
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,880
I wouldn't have got into that car!

612
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,080
The car wouldn't have crashed and...

613
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,440
I wouldn't be this
breathing corpse today!

614
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,120
What breathing? What corpse?
You're fine.

615
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,760
You'll definitely play the next series.

616
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,120
I'm fine?

617
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,560
I'm fine, is it?

618
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,120
This is fine?

619
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,240
Where's my bat, Dad?
Get my bat!

620
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,280
Like this... will I play like this?

621
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,080
Cricket is not just about batting.

622
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Happy birthday, Anina.

623
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,720
A N I N A

624
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,720
Whether you go right to left,
or left to right...

625
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,400
Anina is Anina.

626
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,520
Anina from the Pavilion End...

627
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,440
left-arm over the wicket...

628
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,840
Camilla is beaten and bowled.

629
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,120
England will tour India
in 10 months.

630
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,120
It's difficult to kill yourself
with one hand.

631
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,320
But playing for India again,
if you wish to,

632
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,520
is an easier option... left.

633
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,800
May I play?

634
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,680
Sure.

635
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,360
Bowling.

636
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,760
Give her the ball.

637
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,520
Come on...

638
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,240
No problem.

639
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,680
Get the ball.

640
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,520
Good bowling!

641
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,920
Catch it.

642
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,400
Out!

643
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,040
January 1995,
India vs. South Africa.

644
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,560
South Africa 76 for no loss

645
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,880
Padam Singh Sodhi's first test match.

646
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,600
In the second ball of his first over
he gets a wicket.

647
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,440
Next ball, the batsman collides
with him while taking a run...

648
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,760
and he fractures a rib.

649
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,720
He doesn't play the rest of the match.

650
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,560
Then, despite taking 42 wickets
in the domestic season,

651
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,640
he's never selected
to play for India again.

652
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,880
The forgotten man now lives
at this address.

653
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
What!

654
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,800
Dad, are you listening?

655
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,120
A random man comes
and says ridiculous things...

656
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,640
and we take it seriously?

657
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,640
Ani, listen to me.

658
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,920
We will go to New York.

659
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,520
I've done full research...

660
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,360
biomechanics and robotic technology
are very advanced now.

661
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,760
A prosthetic arm can be just
like a real hand.

662
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,480
You'll be able to do everything.

663
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,800
Who knows...

664
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,360
you might be able to bat one day!

665
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,200
We have also done our research...

666
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,440
she won't be allowed to play
with this bio-robot.

667
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,400
The rules don't allow it.

668
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,160
I want to play for India.

669
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,160
India?

670
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,880
Papa, will you say something?

671
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,960
With one eye, if Tiger Pataudi,
could captain the Indian team...

672
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,760
with one hand, why can't she
play for India?

673
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,640
Who is it?

674
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Anina.

675
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,200
Come in.

676
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,920
I can come in only if you open the door.

677
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,080
The lock is jammed
from inside...

678
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,800
You'll have to open it
from outside.

679
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,960
- How?
- On your right-hand side--

680
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
You were saying,
on my right-hand side...

681
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,760
There is a big flowerpot.
The key is under it.

682
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,000
It's very heavy.

683
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,320
Exactly why the key is safe
under it.

684
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,000
What happened?

685
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,600
Can't do it?

686
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,320
You can't do it.

687
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,400
Go home.

688
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,960
When life shuts the door on your face

689
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,600
you can't open it,

690
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,280
you have to break it open!

691
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,680
Lesson number one.

692
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,400
- What happened?
- House warming!

693
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,080
Who is this?

694
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,080
Hi.

695
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,840
- Anina.
- Rasika.

696
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,400
She's left handed!

697
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,120
It's her only hand left.

698
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,440
Bowl.

699
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,760
Here?

700
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah.

701
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,800
But this is a jungle.

702
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,720
What do you want? MCG?

703
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,320
Make your Melbourne Cricket Ground here.

704
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,880
What happened?

705
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,640
I see...

706
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,200
Not enough space for a stadium?

707
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,200
Forget the stadium,
nobody is going to watch anyway.

708
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,160
Just make the ground. Enough.

709
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
Actually...

710
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,840
who needs a ground?

711
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,240
No one's going to hit a boundary!

712
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,400
All a bowler needs is...

713
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,320
...five, six, seven...

714
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,760
...just 22 yards...

715
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,080
and a little more.

716
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,720
Just make a pitch and bowl.

717
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,680
I have to make... a pitch?

718
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,920
You'll be the one bowling, right?

719
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,600
Don't worry, you'll get help.

720
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,560
- Why trouble the poor thing...
- Buzz off.

721
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,800
Go on, open it.

722
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,560
Is this a joke?

723
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,040
I want to be a bowler,
not a gardener.

724
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,280
Your left hand that's been cleaning
just one thing all its life...

725
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,360
can't suddenly wake up one day
and bowl!

726
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,680
Your left hand has to earn
the right to bowl.

727
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,200
"When all it takes is one eye"

728
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,840
"To see a dream"

729
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,560
"Does it matter if you don't have two?"

730
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,720
"When all it takes is one paddle"

731
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,440
"To steer a boat across the river"

732
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,320
"Does it matter if you don't have two?"

733
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,600
"So what if you don't have it"

734
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
"So what if you have a little less"

735
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,720
"So what if your heart
is a little heavy"

736
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,400
"Do what you must"

737
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,840
"Your power comes from having less"

738
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,440
"Forget the complaints"

739
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,560
"Soar like an eagle"

740
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,320
"Flapping one wing"

741
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,640
"Rise above your destiny"

742
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,760
"Forget the complaints"

743
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,240
"Soar like an eagle"

744
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,880
"Flapping one wing"

745
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,720
"Rise above your destiny"

746
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,200
I'm hungry.

747
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,640
Me too.

748
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,240
Flour, potatoes, onions
and chillies.

749
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,800
Can we order something?

750
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,200
Sure, order...

751
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,120
one right hand.

752
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,320
You made a map of England...

753
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,560
Gobble up England.

754
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,760
Won't you eat?

755
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,120
Thank you.

756
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,240
Leg piece.

757
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,000
I ordered it.

758
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,560
"There's one sun, one moon"

759
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,160
"One earth, one sky"

760
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,320
"See yourself...
you're one of a kind too"

761
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
"Look around you"

762
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,840
"Everyone wants to be one in a million"

763
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,200
"Luckily, you're already
one in a million"

764
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,680
"You are the one"

765
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,840
Bad light stops play.

766
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,840
What are you doing here?

767
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,200
You asked me to get out,
so I'm standing outside.

768
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,080
Why weren't you waiting outside
all these days?

769
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,600
You'll get tired if you follow me.

770
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,120
If I do, I'll catch my breath
and catch up.

771
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,040
My path is different.

772
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,760
No no no, not that one!

773
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,240
- That's Dhoni.
- Dhoni?

774
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,840
Wicket keeper... to stop the ball.

775
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,760
But he'll put up nets for that.

776
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,160
If he hears you,
he'll make me put them up.

777
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,440
Rasika!

778
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,240
She didn't call me.
I'm the one who came to help.

779
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,480
Help?

780
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,600
Hold her hand.

781
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,880
Now help her bowl.

782
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,480
Bowl.

783
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,600
Bowl!

784
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,640
Cricket is not a team sport...

785
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,320
until you're in the team.

786
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,560
Get lost!

787
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,680
Crib, crib, crib, crib.

788
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,200
Couldn't find anyone to marry...

789
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,800
takes out his prustration on me.

790
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,120
"There's one sun, one moon"

791
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,520
"One earth, one sky"

792
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,760
"See yourself...
you're one of a kind too"

793
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,760
"Look around you"

794
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,280
"Everyone wants to be one in a million"

795
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,680
"Luckily, you're already
one in a million"

796
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,320
"You are the one"

797
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,920
Water has stopped.

798
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,120
"Forget the complaints"

799
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,480
"Soar like an eagle"

800
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,880
"Flapping one wing"

801
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,160
"Rise above your destiny"

802
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,520
Booster is the secret of your energy.

803
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,760
Whoa!

804
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,960
What have you done!

805
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,480
Give me your hand.

806
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,360
No no, what if he sees me
lending a hand?

807
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,640
Just give your hand.

808
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,680
- Aah... is that a hand or a hammer!
- See.

809
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,280
All this gardening
has turned you into Muhammad Ali!

810
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,760
Now I feel like a bowler.

811
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,640
It's a beautiful day at the MCG.

812
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,280
Play is all set to begin.

813
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,160
There is an unwanted spectator
on the field.

814
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,840
Anina from the Pavilion End.

815
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,120
Left-arm... over the wicket.

816
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,480
Short and wide.

817
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,840
The batsman smashes the ball
in his sleep...

818
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,400
for 4 runs.

819
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,920
A rubbish half volley... 6 runs.

820
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,720
2 kms away from the leg stump...
4 wides.

821
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,160
A rubbish full toss.

822
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,280
The ball flies out of the stadium...
8 runs.

823
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,160
If muscles were all a bowler needed,

824
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,880
Muhammad Ali would've been
the world's best bowler.

825
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,520
'I'm a bowler.'

826
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,320
Before you utter these three words...

827
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:35,480
bowl at least three thousand times!

828
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,240
Bowl!

829
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,160
Pitch it here.

830
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,600
Here.

831
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,000
Get up.

832
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,680
Just look at Bishan Singh Bedi.

833
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,200
Even if I practice for 10 years,
I won't be able to bowl like this.

834
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,000
Congratulations, you're pregnant.

835
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,800
You're comparing yourself
with Bishan Singh Bedi.

836
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,760
Means, there's a bowler
growing inside you.

837
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,640
Waiting to be born.

838
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,680
Hi.

839
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,880
Rasika!

840
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:42,840
I've told you so many times
to get that fence fixed!

841
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,280
Bloody buffaloes!

842
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:45,880
See the mess they've made.

843
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,240
What a mess!

844
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,600
Shit!

845
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,280
It's about to rain.

846
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,600
Bowl.

847
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,600
- How?
- Bowl.

848
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,440
- I'll clean this in two minutes.
- We don't have two minutes.

849
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,480
Bowl, come on... Bowl bowl bowl!

850
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,880
- The ball will land on the dung.
- Shut up!

851
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,720
Left-arm around the wicket.

852
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,840
Hurry up!

853
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,520
A good length delivery...
on the off stump.

854
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,080
The batsman had to defend.

855
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,680
Correct line... on the middle stump.

856
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,600
The batsman defends again.

857
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,960
Full length... a beautiful delivery

858
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,880
No big shot played.

859
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,960
One perfect ball after another.

860
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,520
I had my heart in my mouth.

861
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,320
What if the ball lands on the dung!

862
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:36,840
He's a genius.

863
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,120
You're the one who bowled,
how is he the genius?

864
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,840
This is short pitched...

865
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,920
This is over pitched...

866
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,240
This is outside the off stump...

867
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,320
And this is outside leg stump.

868
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,160
If the ball lands
here... here... here...

869
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,680
it's a shit ball.

870
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,640
I've been avoiding the dung and
aiming at the gaps while bowling.

871
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,080
The line and length became perfect.

872
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:57,880
Shit!

873
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,400
Shit is a good fertilizer for growth!

874
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,280
Till you can bowl perfectly
with your eyes closed...

875
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,560
Bowl!

876
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,880
Why is it so important for you
to make her a cricketer?

877
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,800
When something is snatched away
from someone without reason...

878
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,840
it's wrong.

879
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,360
Looks like God has sent you here
to rectify His mistakes.

880
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,520
Give me some more nectar.

881
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,320
- No more.
- What!

882
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,880
From now on, I'll be the one
rectifying mistakes.

883
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,240
It's a Dry Day, from today.

884
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,400
Damn woman!
Who are you to shut my bar?

885
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,720
I am that woman, who would've died a man
if not for you.

886
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,840
You understood my reality,

887
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,760
fought with my family,

888
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,160
helped me get operated,

889
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,160
gave me a new identity,

890
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,440
adopted me as your sister...

891
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,240
Your liver... I will not let it die!

892
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,000
Liver?

893
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,640
If I don't drink one day,

894
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,600
my liver will message
the other workers of my body...

895
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,040
'Boss is dead. Stop work now!'

896
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,640
Shutter down.

897
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,480
I'll truly die.

898
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,600
Then who will rectify
your God's mistakes?

899
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,480
I don't understand...

900
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,160
how did the buffaloes shit
in the perfect spots?

901
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,880
Happy Diwali!

902
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,720
Happy Diwali!

903
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,120
Happy Diwali!

904
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,840
Happy Diwali, sir.

905
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,000
Sir... this is Jeet.

906
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,240
Jeet, Paddy sir.

907
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,600
- Hello, sir. Happy Diwali.
- I'm not happy!

908
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,760
You have to be happy today, sir.

909
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,000
You're not allowed to sit alone
in the dark.

910
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,920
Bowl.

911
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,280
How, sir?

912
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,360
Bowl!

913
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,240
Now please be a little happy, sir.

914
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,280
Would you have...

915
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,560
got out to your own bowling?

916
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:51,000
Once upon a time,
you used to bat, right?

917
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,480
Could you take your own wicket?

918
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,520
Forget that...

919
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,240
could you at least beat your bat
with this bowling?

920
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,920
No?

921
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:08,000
So then... what do I have
to be so happy for?

922
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,480
More importantly...

923
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,360
what are you so happy for?

924
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,640
Pitching a ball on the right spot
doesn't make anyone a bowler.

925
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,640
Wickets.

926
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,720
A bowler's job is to take wickets.

927
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,120
And you're not capable of taking
even a tail-ender's wicket.

928
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,120
I've been staying up nights thinking...

929
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,680
how will this girl take wickets?

930
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,560
What does a spinner have except

931
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,720
the art of deceiving the batsman

932
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,760
and the magic of playing
with the batsman's mind.

933
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,600
But how will the spinner
weave her magic

934
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,880
if she isn't able to spin the ball?

935
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,680
My head is spinning,
thinking about this.

936
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,000
And you!

937
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:54,160
You're going around with your lover,

938
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,360
bursting crackers and giving out sweets!

939
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,480
- Sir.
- I'm talking to my player.

940
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,160
Hunger.

941
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:11,200
The hunger to play for India
is your biggest strength.

942
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:15,120
If you keep satiating this hunger
with sweet nothings,

943
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,480
you'll be finished!

944
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,640
And you'll have to wait
for Diwali every year

945
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,840
to be happy!

946
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,840
7 a.m. tomorrow.

947
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,920
Stuff cotton in your ears
and go to bed.

948
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,120
Alone!

949
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,000
Leave her hand.

950
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,120
It's fine, it's okay.

951
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,840
Leave her hand.

952
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,440
- I said, leave her hand!
- Sir!

953
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,200
You okay?

954
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,360
Sir...

955
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,040
No!

956
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,800
Let go of her hand
or I'll set you on fire.

957
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,240
- Stop it, sir.
- Leave her hand!

958
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,680
Sir... what are you doing?

959
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,520
It's Diwali... Hold her hand. Boom!

960
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,240
Hold.

961
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:21,520
- Sir, stop it.
- Dare hold her hand?

962
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,360
Boom!

963
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,800
Diwali! Diwali! Diwali! Hold her hand.

964
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,760
Stop it, sir.

965
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,200
Hold, hold. Boom! Boom!

966
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,160
"The lamp burns my soul."

967
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,960
Wickets.

968
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:51,920
Wickets.

969
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,440
He's a psychopath.

970
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,920
You should've seen him, Granny.

971
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,360
He looked possessed.

972
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,760
Crazy man.

973
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,360
What does he think of himself?

974
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,240
Thinks he's her father?

975
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,800
Bloody fellow!

976
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,440
He came here on his own.

977
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,680
We didn't go begging for his help.

978
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,600
Does he think he owns her?

979
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,160
Torturing her like this!

980
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,280
Exactly.

981
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,480
Exactly.

982
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,880
He does not own her,

983
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,680
he's not her father, brother,
or boyfriend.

984
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,680
He came here uninvited

985
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,840
and took on the responsibility
of her future.

986
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,480
Do you know how much
the monthly electricity bill is?

987
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,960
No one gives electricity, for free.

988
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,320
And this psychopath...

989
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,800
wants to light up the entire life
of a complete stranger, for free!

990
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,800
Crazy man.

991
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,120
I know a coach has to be tough.

992
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,160
But so ruthless.

993
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,600
She's a young girl.

994
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,240
She has lost her arm,
not her heart.

995
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,920
What if something had happened
to the boy?

996
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,680
Why take out your prustration on her?

997
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,120
Yes, I am prustrated.

998
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,720
Pucking prustrated!

999
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,920
My mother died giving birth to me...

1000
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,080
I was born prustrated.

1001
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,960
My father brought home a new wife...

1002
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,200
childhood prustrated.

1003
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,480
Then Cricket took pity on me
and adopted me...

1004
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,840
and my dream came true.

1005
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,040
The dream of playing for India one day.

1006
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,280
One day is all I played for India.

1007
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,280
My entire youth prustrated.

1008
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,080
Logically, I should have got
another chance to play for India

1009
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,880
but this life...

1010
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,000
isn't a game of logic.

1011
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,280
This life...

1012
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,680
is a game of magic.

1013
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,800
Magic.

1014
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,160
But this magic never came
into my life.

1015
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,960
'The system is corrupt.'

1016
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,280
'Politics in the team.'

1017
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,160
'Selectors are puckall.'

1018
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,840
Hearing my constant cribbing,
Magic got prustrated and ran away!

1019
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,160
My hair turned grey.
I stopped talking.

1020
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,600
I stopped living.

1021
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:04,520
Then, one day suddenly,
there was a knock at my door.

1022
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,440
Opened... saw... it was MAGIC!!!

1023
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,360
'Hello, Paddy. How are you?'

1024
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,400
'Sorry, I couldn't bring magic
to your life.'

1025
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,960
'Try again?
Want another chance?'

1026
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,120
'Here... take Anina. Try.'

1027
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,880
Anina has plenty of talent...

1028
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,480
courage, passion, guts.

1029
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,600
But logically...

1030
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,280
can someone with just one hand
play for the country?

1031
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,040
No.

1032
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,480
You need magic.

1033
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,280
But this damn magic appears

1034
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,280
only when you're 100% ready for it.

1035
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,480
You have to earn the magic!

1036
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,120
Otherwise...

1037
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,760
it's the end of play.

1038
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,400
For a spectator,

1039
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,320
sport is just a game.

1040
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,520
But for players,

1041
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,400
sport is sacrifice.

1042
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,920
What a loser feels...

1043
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,160
I know.

1044
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,840
I know.

1045
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,360
I want her to know...

1046
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,680
how winners feel.

1047
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:03,360
I also want to know...

1048
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,160
what winners feel.

1049
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,000
Just one day...

1050
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,960
just for one day,
I want to live...

1051
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,920
without prustration.

1052
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,480
For one day.

1053
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,400
Sacrifice.

1054
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,320
Okay now you can spin the ball

1055
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,680
but would you be able
to take your own wicket?

1056
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:58,880
No.

1057
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:00,640
Why?

1058
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,800
There's spin but no speed.

1059
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,240
That nip is not there.

1060
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,440
Any half-decent batter
will easily play such slow spin.

1061
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,040
To get a wicket,

1062
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,520
the ball should turn sharply...
like zuckkkk!

1063
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,560
So what the 'zuck' are you waiting for?

1064
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,520
If the ball needs more speed,
bowl with more speed.

1065
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,400
More.

1066
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,720
More!

1067
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,560
Can't bowl faster than this, sir.

1068
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,640
You can.

1069
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,720
Bowl.

1070
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,320
More...

1071
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,840
More.

1072
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:39,160
We're done.

1073
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:40,880
Yes.

1074
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,200
If you strain your shoulder,
it may get dislocated again.

1075
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,480
Complete rest for two weeks.

1076
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,960
Why? It's not so serious.

1077
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,800
Now that you've set it,
why can't she bowl?

1078
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,120
I've dislocated my shoulder
multiple times,

1079
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,040
physio used to set it
and I was back on the field.

1080
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,200
Mr Sodhi, get up and bowl.

1081
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,360
Come on, get up... and bowl.

1082
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,920
- Bowl?
- Yeah.

1083
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:14,520
Stop.

1084
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,600
When you bowl left arm,

1085
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,880
your right arm automatically
swings back.

1086
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,760
The reverse motion of the right arm
creates the momentum

1087
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,520
that gives a left-arm bowler
that extra force.

1088
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,600
That's why your left arm
can generate more pace

1089
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,000
not Anina's.

1090
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,760
To compensate for that momentum,

1091
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,960
if she tries to generate the same force
with only one hand,

1092
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,320
her shoulder could get
permanently damaged.

1093
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,240
So, Anina...

1094
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,400
Yes, sir, I know... basic Physics.

1095
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:49,280
Mr Sodhi, I'm a doctor
but I'm an Indian too.

1096
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,120
Cricket runs in my blood, too.

1097
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,840
You've done more than you could

1098
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,600
you've done your best.

1099
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,800
Hello.

1100
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,680
You here to offer your sympathies again?

1101
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,200
- I was just trying to--
- Dad, ask him to get out.

1102
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,120
Why is your timing always off?

1103
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,160
Time the ball, no?

1104
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,000
Momentum... how to generate momentum?

1105
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,640
Momentum. Come on think.

1106
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,840
Enough now.

1107
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,560
Get me whisky.

1108
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,760
Spin...

1109
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,040
Momentum.

1110
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,640
This 'mentum mentum'
will make you go mad!

1111
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,120
Not here, idiot! Stupid woman.

1112
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,200
Not on the pitch!

1113
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,840
On the side... at short leg!

1114
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,000
Is this short leg, you fool?

1115
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,360
How do I know where short leg is!

1116
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,080
Do short people field at that position?

1117
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,480
It's not me, it's your cricket
that's foolish.

1118
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,360
It's an English game
but all the English is wrong!

1119
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:16,120
Short leg...

1120
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,800
And slip?
Does everyone 'slip' over there?

1121
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,160
Shut up and get out!

1122
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,400
I'm already outside!

1123
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,400
Say 'get in'.

1124
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,280
Hey... what just happened?

1125
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,880
'What just happened'?

1126
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,880
I just escaped death.

1127
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:48,240
We just escaped death.

1128
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,720
Mr Padam Singh? Come in.

1129
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,760
Tea? Coffee?

1130
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:03,720
Welcome, my 'basic Physics' expert.

1131
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,400
Shall we show the world...

1132
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,280
momentum?

1133
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,680
- Hello, sir.
- Well done, son...

1134
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,320
fantastic absolutely.

1135
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,320
You sent it to 'the' Bishan Singh Bedi?

1136
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,680
The greatest left-arm spinner
the world has ever seen.

1137
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,680
Not known for hiding his feelings.

1138
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,800
You guys think Kajal is good, right?

1139
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,200
Kajal can't...

1140
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,360
- Sir, but...
- She hasn't played...

1141
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,520
After the break,
she isn't consistent.

1142
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,840
Bishan Singh Bedi?

1143
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,400
- Carry on, guys.
- Okay.

1144
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:15,920
- Kajal...
- No no no!

1145
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,360
Guys, you should check this out.

1146
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:32,360
Unbelievable!

1147
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,640
Is this the same Anina?

1148
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,640
If she doesn't have a twin sister,
it's her!

1149
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,400
How is this possible?

1150
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,040
She wasn't even a bowler.

1151
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:42,480
There are a lot of free apps.

1152
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,440
You can easily morph your face
on another body.

1153
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:50,840
Hello?

1154
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,960
Anina, this is Hemanti Dhingra

1155
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,680
from the selection committee, remember?

1156
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,720
Ani...

1157
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:57,720
'Hello?'

1158
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,880
Yes, ma'am?

1159
01:30:59,080 --> 01:30:59,960
Tell me, ma'am.

1160
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,760
How are you?
Health wealth all okay?

1161
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,120
Wealth same. Health better, ma'am.

1162
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,040
Anina...

1163
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,520
did you see a video?

1164
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,960
Which video, ma'am?

1165
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,280
You didn't see it?
I knew it.

1166
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,200
'Technology is so advanced now...'

1167
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,280
if you see it, you'll truly think
it's you who's bowling.

1168
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,280
Truth will look like the truth, ma'am.

1169
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,280
Are you seriously asking us
to consider her?

1170
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:30,760
It is our job to make sure,

1171
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,320
there is absolutely no discrimination
of any sort in this game.

1172
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,440
Is she good enough to play
for India or not...

1173
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,080
it is our duty to check that out.

1174
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,560
Thank you, ma'am.

1175
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,920
Granny, they are calling me
for the Indian camp!

1176
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,160
Why are you underacting?
Show some emotion.

1177
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,280
I'm a Federer fan.

1178
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,880
We don't show our emotions.

1179
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,720
Fantastic!

1180
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:45,760
I've never seen anything like this.

1181
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,000
But, one problem...
she won't be able to bat.

1182
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:48,760
So?

1183
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,280
B.S. Chandrashekhar couldn't bat.

1184
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:53,640
Is she good enough to play
as a specialist bowler or not?

1185
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,120
She is amazing.

1186
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,680
A one-handed player...

1187
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,160
in an international cricket team...

1188
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,720
the media will go into a frenzy.

1189
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,840
What a story, ma'am.

1190
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,040
We should renegotiate
the telecast rights.

1191
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,520
Mr Bhavik, I know you're
the Treasurer of the Cricket Board

1192
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,960
but for once, please forget the treasure
and focus on the cricket.

1193
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,200
Welcome to the first
A23 one-day international

1194
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,240
between England and India.

1195
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,600
News from the middle is
that England have won the toss

1196
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,080
and elected to bat.

1197
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,160
It's a historical day
in the game of cricket.

1198
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,960
Look at Anina swinging
her left arm.

1199
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,840
What a way to make
your international debut in cricket.

1200
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,760
What a day for me to make my debut
as a commentator.

1201
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,080
'Start of the innings... first ball.'

1202
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,360
'Archer taking guard.'

1203
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,680
'Six fielders on the offside
and three on the onside.'

1204
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,480
Dipti from the Pavilion End to Archer.

1205
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,040
Archer drives... through extra cover
for 4

1206
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,560
and England are on their way.

1207
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,720
Great wristwork... 4 runs.

1208
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,200
Backfoot punch.
No chance to stop it.

1209
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,960
Over mid-on... 4 runs.
Beautiful cover drive.

1210
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,280
Played to Anina...
Not a clean pick up and throw.

1211
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,560
1 run added.

1212
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,760
Super shot over cover.

1213
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,000
And 6 runs!

1214
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,400
England off to a flying start here.

1215
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:44,640
The first bowling change...

1216
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,960
it's the girl that
we've all been waiting for.

1217
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,400
The atmosphere is charged with emotion.

1218
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,600
The question is...

1219
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,760
will it play on the minds of the
English batters out in the middle?

1220
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:59,280
I don't know about the English but
is it okay for an Indian to

1221
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,520
shed a tear or two on live television?

1222
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,480
I'm going to stand up.

1223
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,680
'First match.'

1224
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,360
'First over.'

1225
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:11,600
'First ball.'

1226
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,640
The entire stadium resounding
with applause.

1227
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,560
Anina from the Pavilion End.

1228
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,600
Left-arm around the wicket.

1229
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,400
A comic moment in this drama.

1230
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,000
Bowler in front of the umpire?
Or umpire in front of the bowler?

1231
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,680
- Ever seen anything like this, Pankaj?
- Never.

1232
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,400
Hearts racing...

1233
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,440
Seems like time itself has stopped.

1234
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,960
A loosener from Anina and
Searle smashes it over midwicket.

1235
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:02,360
With this 6, Searle's score moves to 48.

1236
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,200
She is in an attacking mood today.

1237
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,200
Anina's second ball...

1238
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,080
Outside the leg stump...
signalled a wide.

1239
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:16,040
Can't imagine the pressure on the girl.

1240
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,200
The captain is having a chat with her.

1241
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,880
Think she's telling her to focus
on her line and length.

1242
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,160
Anina's next ball...

1243
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,840
This was a good ball.

1244
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,760
Correct line and length.
Searle forced to defend.

1245
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,520
The batter takes two steps
outside the crease.

1246
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,080
Let's see if Anina can adjust
her length.

1247
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,840
Bang on middle stump... correct length.

1248
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,640
No chance to play an attacking shot.

1249
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,360
Slowly gaining confidence...

1250
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,840
Anina is back to her bowling mark.

1251
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,160
In... comes... Anina...

1252
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:04,920
What was that?

1253
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,400
What was that arrow!

1254
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,040
Batters, spectators...
everyone in shock.

1255
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:16,320
Just look at that.

1256
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:33,360
A spinning spinner.

1257
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,200
She is a Ghoomer.

1258
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,840
A Ghoom-what?

1259
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:38,000
Pacer...

1260
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,240
Spinner...

1261
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:41,400
Ghoomer!

1262
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,600
'The momentum that's gained
by the swing of the right hand...'

1263
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:51,280
'will be achieved by spinning
your body.'

1264
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,720
'If you spin, the ball will spin.'

1265
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,520
Zuckkkk!

1266
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,760
There's a lot of confusion out there.

1267
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:03,960
Is it within the laws of the game?

1268
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:05,960
Batters can do whatever they want...

1269
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,000
switch from being a righty to a lefty
mid-delivery.

1270
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,240
Switch hit, reverse sweep...
are all legal.

1271
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,080
Why can't a bowler change her action?

1272
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,960
Sorry, switching from
English to Hindi...

1273
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,320
Is that within the laws of the game?

1274
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,520
Law 21...

1275
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,960
ICC Book of Cricket Rules.
Allowed.

1276
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,720
You can change action.
As long as you bowl with the same hand

1277
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,120
and from the same side of the wicket.

1278
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,920
Anina from the Pavilion End...
spinning around.

1279
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:34,640
An appeal!

1280
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,960
It's a leg bye.
Struck outside the leg stump.

1281
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:38,480
End of a unique over.

1282
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,880
"Ghoom Ghoom Ghoomer spinning."

1283
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,800
After the dance performance
of the last over...

1284
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,200
back to cricket.

1285
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,040
Anjali in to Searle.

1286
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,720
It's up in the air...

1287
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:53,160
And she's out!

1288
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,080
Caught Dipti, bowled Anjali...

1289
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,520
and Anina?

1290
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,640
'Bowling has partnerships too.'

1291
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,840
Sometimes a wicket falls

1292
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:07,560
'due to pressure created
in the previous over.'

1293
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,600
'Last ball from Anjali.'

1294
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,640
'No runs. End of the over.'

1295
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,840
"Ghoom Ghoom Ghoomer spinning."

1296
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:27,040
That's my song!

1297
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,320
They think, copyright means...
everyone has the right to copy.

1298
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,120
No... I'll explain later.

1299
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,960
Anina spins again...

1300
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,600
Boom boom boom!
One bullet ball after another.

1301
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:49,320
'After two balls, the surprise
won't stay a surprise.'

1302
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,480
After zuck zuck zuck...

1303
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:54,760
...zzzuuuuuck.

1304
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:04,080
That is her first wicket in cricket.

1305
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,640
'This is called deception.'

1306
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,400
'This is not just a thinking bowler
this is an out-thinking bowler.'

1307
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,600
Great, fantastic, mind-blowing, miracle.

1308
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,960
Beautiful. Beautiful deception.

1309
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,320
Ghoomer became a floater.

1310
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:24,280
A small change in pace...
Archer back to the pavilion.

1311
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,040
Next in, Camila Williams, the captain.

1312
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,040
Archer telling her, I'm sure,
of Anina's change of pace.

1313
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,000
She just got out, what will she advise!

1314
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,400
Sorry, Williams taking guard.

1315
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,920
Anina... looking for her second wicket.

1316
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,440
The English captain, the best batter
in the team...

1317
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:47,840
Camila Williams.

1318
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,360
Scored three centuries in
one-day cricket this year.

1319
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,680
Come on, Ani!

1320
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:55,840
Stumped!

1321
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,480
In the umpire's goggles,
the spinning Ghoomer sees

1322
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,160
Williams coming forward.

1323
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,920
Goggle... became Google.

1324
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,160
If you're not watching this,
you're missing something.

1325
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:25,600
'Get to the ground, get to a TV,
radio, phone...'

1326
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,920
'get to something.'

1327
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,120
'Cricket is being Ghoomered!'

1328
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,160
Bowling change from the far end.

1329
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:40,200
Bernadette thrashes this one for 4.

1330
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,720
'Cracking shot!'

1331
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,200
'Looks like the English have decided to
go after the bowling at the other end.'

1332
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,400
16 runs from that over.

1333
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,960
Start of Ghoomer's third over.

1334
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,240
Come on.

1335
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,280
An easy catch dropped in the slips.

1336
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,600
Sorry...

1337
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,080
commentator... neutral...

1338
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,320
Stiff upper lip.

1339
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,400
I'm an Aussie.

1340
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,480
Sorry, mate.

1341
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:11,880
Next ball.

1342
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,400
Shot!

1343
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,480
Over the long on boundary... 6 runs.

1344
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:19,200
The ball was a bit short,
easily hit for 6.

1345
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,960
Next ball.

1346
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,400
Short and Bernadette pulls it
through square leg for 4.

1347
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:27,360
The English batters have decided,
attack is the best form of defence.

1348
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:28,320
What a shot! 4 runs!

1349
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,560
'Has the dropped catch
affected her length, I wonder.'

1350
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,680
Looks like Bernadette
has managed to rattle her

1351
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:35,560
with her aggression.

1352
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,520
Fantastic batting by Bernadette.

1353
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,320
Pin-drop silence in the stadium.

1354
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,680
Anina in deep thought.

1355
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:49,080
Yes!

1356
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,400
'Clean bowled!'

1357
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,920
When you bowl a yorker

1358
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:57,000
the greatest batter looks like a joker.

1359
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:58,240
Sorry.

1360
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:01,000
Poetry in cricket brings out
the poet in me.

1361
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,280
116 for 4. And I'm so sorry
to be breaking into Hindi.

1362
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,560
Sounds beautiful.

1363
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:14,720
Just a one step run-up
but what a fast yorker!

1364
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:18,240
The concentration-smoothie-effect.

1365
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,440
Ghoomer!

1366
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,440
Spin from the other end too.

1367
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:31,040
'A good shot... boundary.'

1368
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,440
'Nasreen right-arm over.'

1369
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,320
'Played towards midwicket... 1 run.'

1370
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,000
'Next ball.'

1371
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,640
'Great shot... ball is in the air...'

1372
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:41,560
Out!

1373
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,960
With that, England lose
their fifth wicket.

1374
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,480
End of a successful over by Nasreen.

1375
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,480
'Anina's fourth over...'

1376
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:55,840
Looks like the captain will make
her bowl all 10 overs together

1377
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:58,280
that is if England isn't bowled out
by then!

1378
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,720
A non-Ghoomer delivery.
Lot of spin.

1379
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,840
Straight action... sharp turn again.

1380
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,800
The batter expecting a Ghoomer

1381
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,240
but Anina bowling straight
and deceiving her.

1382
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,080
The ball is in the air...

1383
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,520
MINE!

1384
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,800
She drops it.

1385
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,440
That was a wrong one
that deceived Amber.

1386
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,920
There was no time
for catching practice!

1387
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,160
The ball was on Anina's
right side...

1388
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,560
maybe someone else
should've gone for it.

1389
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:39,000
Maybe someone else
should've been commentating.

1390
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,640
A Jonty Rhodes like you
also misses a catch!

1391
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:46,560
Mr Sunny is commentating over there,
may I sit here?

1392
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,160
- But, sir...
- I'm fine.

1393
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,800
Please carry on.

1394
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,480
And to bowl the over's
last delivery, Amit--

1395
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:54,400
er, Anina comes in.

1396
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:58,960
And Amber out.
Caught and bowled!

1397
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:00,000
Great catch.

1398
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:03,760
Fluke!

1399
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:06,960
It looks like, she has hurt herself.

1400
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,800
The physio coming on to the field.

1401
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,400
'Anina is leaving the field.'

1402
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,320
Even if she retires hurt now...

1403
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:25,240
she will have left her mark
in cricketing history.

1404
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:28,280
Only those who have no desire
to move forward...

1405
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,360
look back at their achievements.

1406
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,720
Don't look back.
The camera is on you.

1407
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,160
4 overs 28 runs and 4 wickets.

1408
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,040
Hello.

1409
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,200
May I go in?

1410
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,040
Are you ice?

1411
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,280
Then you have no work inside.

1412
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:56,480
Goes on her knees,
clears the boundary,

1413
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:57,320
6 runs.

1414
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,400
A lofted shot straight to long on.

1415
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,760
Oh ho... 4 runs.

1416
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:06,000
Played between point and gully...
4 runs.

1417
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,680
Whacked over mid on...
4 runs.

1418
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,000
What are they bowling?

1419
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,520
Drives through extra cover for 4.

1420
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,320
Ball is in the air... 6 runs!

1421
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,640
Welcome back, Amitabh.

1422
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,680
Looks like a whole new game out there
without the left-arm Ghoomer.

1423
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,560
'England's middle order wreaking havoc
in Anina's absence.'

1424
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:26,360
Go.

1425
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,600
'India again on the back foot.'

1426
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,440
Go!

1427
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:34,960
According to the rules...

1428
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,080
when a bowler stays off the field
for a period of time...

1429
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,520
she has to wait
for the same amount of time...

1430
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:40,800
to bowl again.

1431
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:44,160
Batsman can retire hurt and
come back anytime and play.

1432
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,840
But a bowler has to come back and wait.

1433
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,920
Who made these rules?

1434
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:50,400
You know, the Brits owe us
more than one explanation.

1435
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:52,720
Lofted... 4 runs.

1436
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:53,920
A great cover drive.

1437
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,880
Shot! No fielder at deep midwicket...
4 runs.

1438
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,960
England know that they have a few overs

1439
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,400
before Anina returns to bowl

1440
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,760
and boy, are they cashing
in before that.

1441
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,320
Played towards midwicket,

1442
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:07,360
first run taken quickly...
Anina's dive saves a boundary.

1443
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:09,280
And... a strong throw...

1444
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,080
this can be a close call.

1445
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,520
240 for 7.

1446
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:16,840
Referred to the third umpire.

1447
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,480
Why do you need a third umpire?

1448
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,520
And that's out!

1449
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,920
A run out is not a bowler's wicket.

1450
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,360
Captain Dipti speaking to the umpire.

1451
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:40,280
'The entire stadium has come alive.'

1452
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:42,880
Ghoomer!

1453
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,440
'Anina's fifth over
from the Pavilion End.'

1454
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,440
The field is spread out.

1455
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:58,120
Let's see if Anina's injury
will affect her bowling.

1456
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,040
Nicole on strike.

1457
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,880
Anina, left arm, around the wicket.

1458
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,320
The shot piercing the field...
4 runs.

1459
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,360
A change in the field.

1460
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,520
Fielders are being brought in
instead of being spread out!

1461
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,960
What's going on?

1462
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:18,520
Slips, gully, forward short leg
and silly point?

1463
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,000
Ghoomer thinking!

1464
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:21,520
'Hurt the ego.'

1465
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,120
'You won't need to take the wicket,'

1466
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,640
'the batter will give it away herself.'

1467
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,880
A drunkard bowling to me?

1468
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:30,720
'This ego led someone to give up
their wicket.'

1469
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,200
Remember?

1470
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:36,440
Out!

1471
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,240
It's a five-wicket haul on debut

1472
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:40,520
for this cricketing wonder.

1473
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,720
A bouncer from a spinner!

1474
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:44,120
Spinner?

1475
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,040
Pfft!

1476
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,520
266 for 8 wickets.

1477
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:05,800
Dipti, right-arm over the wicket.

1478
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,200
That's leg before.

1479
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:08,640
And that's the 9th wicket.

1480
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,720
Clean bowled.

1481
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,960
England all out for 266.

1482
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,480
12 overs wasted.

1483
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,480
Wickets falling in a heap at the end.

1484
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,040
And after all that drama,
it's a pretty decent score

1485
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:35,400
which will require some getting.

1486
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,680
Remember India have just 10 batters.

1487
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,640
The Ghoomer does not bat.

1488
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:40,920
SKY bowls?

1489
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:41,880
Virat bowls?

1490
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,760
Rohit bowls? KL bowls?

1491
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,400
Batters don't bowl...

1492
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,920
why should she have to bat?

1493
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,560
Before she can catch her breath...

1494
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:54,680
they start hounding with mics
and questions.

1495
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:56,400
Let the match get over first!

1496
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:07,560
Sir?

1497
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,080
They say, you can't clap
with one hand.

1498
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:16,200
But this one hand
has created an applause

1499
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,280
that will echo for years.

1500
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,200
- Hello?
- 'What fabulous bowling, Ghoomer!'

1501
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,720
Rasika, why aren't you here?

1502
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,280
Paddy brother said, in the ground
you can't see much from a distance

1503
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,120
TV is better.

1504
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,000
Start of the Indian innings...
target 267.

1505
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,920
Evans to Dipti,
right-arm over the wicket.

1506
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,840
Cracking shot.
6 runs off the very first ball.

1507
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,080
'The Indian innings on its way.'

1508
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,560
Outside off, played between
gully and point... 4 runs.

1509
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,400
Great timing. No chance to stop it.

1510
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:00,520
Oh ho ho!

1511
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:02,880
Wherever you place the fielders,
we'll hit it over them.

1512
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,960
Dipti off to a flyer.

1513
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:06,960
An appeal...

1514
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:08,160
and out!

1515
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:10,040
India lose their first wicket.

1516
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,600
Trying to steal a single here...

1517
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,200
saved by a whisker.

1518
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,840
That could've been a run out.

1519
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,040
We have 38 overs.
We need only 5 runs per over.

1520
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:24,880
Way outside off.

1521
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:25,840
Play straight.

1522
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,160
For her, playing straight means
straight over mid off.

1523
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,920
Runs flowing off Dipti's bat.

1524
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:37,240
This crazy girl is batting like
it's a T20.

1525
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,720
- You won't get a chance to bat.
- Shall I take off my pads?

1526
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,560
Next ball.

1527
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,000
A bullet-like straight drive.

1528
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:47,120
Shot!

1529
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:51,240
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sir.

1530
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:52,920
Williams to Shreya.

1531
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:54,040
Driven square.

1532
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,200
Bernadette to Shreya...

1533
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,160
And... out!

1534
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,520
Caught and bowled.

1535
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:11,720
Next ball...

1536
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,000
played in the air...

1537
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,720
a fielder coming under it... and out!

1538
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,240
Third wicket down for India.

1539
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,040
Beautifully done there by England.

1540
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,800
A flighted delivery...

1541
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,120
bowled!

1542
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:27,720
Within a few moments,
a cloud of gloom has descended.

1543
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,200
A cracking shot by Dipti.

1544
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:35,560
Out!

1545
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,880
'Right shot but the placement
was wrong.'

1546
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,960
This is called snatching defeat
from the jaws of victory!

1547
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,000
We can still win it.
Play out Evans--

1548
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:53,120
Cricket can be a funny game but
the Indians are not laughing.

1549
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:55,600
Williams with four wickets
and her tail up...

1550
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:58,040
just two wickets to go
for an English win.

1551
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:00,480
31 runs for an Indian win.

1552
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,200
Williams' next ball...

1553
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,720
Sets off for a quick single.

1554
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,400
This could be close.

1555
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,560
Super shot!

1556
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,200
Played in the gap...

1557
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,800
fielder dives... 4 runs.

1558
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:18,280
Another great shot.

1559
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,680
Defensive push.
Another misfield.

1560
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,160
Bernadette.

1561
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,760
Yorker.

1562
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,000
Tempers going up in the field.

1563
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,520
It's all about who keeps a cooler head.

1564
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,320
A gentle push for 1 run.

1565
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:35,200
Runs coming in singles,
India moving towards its target.

1566
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:41,440
Another single.

1567
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,400
Just simple responsible batting

1568
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:45,720
has put India back in the driver's seat.

1569
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,360
Only 10 more runs to win.

1570
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:50,120
Fantastic shot... 6 runs.

1571
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:51,680
Only 4 more runs to win.

1572
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,880
It's good to see you smiling again.

1573
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:55,880
We Indians have a great
sense of humor...

1574
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,560
when we are winning.

1575
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,120
India on the brink of victory.

1576
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,880
India one shot away from victory.

1577
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,440
Williams... the ball is up in the air,
towards mid on...

1578
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,320
and she's out!

1579
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,240
Another irresponsible shot.

1580
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,280
Caught at mid on.

1581
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,360
England one wicket away from victory.

1582
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:13,680
This is a nail-biter.

1583
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:16,800
Only 4 more runs needed...
so many overs left.

1584
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,000
When singles can do the job...

1585
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,040
why play such a bad shot?

1586
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:28,320
Preeta, just play straight okay.

1587
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,320
You can do it. Come on.
Best of luck.

1588
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,200
'Best of luck.'

1589
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:41,600
After all the hard work, courage,
passion and fame...

1590
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:44,360
it all comes down to luck!

1591
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:47,480
Tension in the air.

1592
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:48,480
Bernadette.

1593
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:49,920
Bowled above waist height.

1594
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:52,400
And it's a no ball.
India have got a free hit.

1595
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:54,800
'Luck is going India's way.'

1596
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,680
Seems, Luck is playing on our side.

1597
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,200
3 runs to win.

1598
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,320
It's a free hit...
can hit it anywhere.

1599
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:02,360
Bernadette...

1600
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:03,480
batter swings...

1601
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,520
straight to the fielder.

1602
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,320
Throw... she knocks the bails off...

1603
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,520
'The English team looks confident.'

1604
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,640
How can Luck play...

1605
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:15,480
when I have snatched it away?

1606
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:17,880
Lady with the sacred thread!

1607
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:27,880
Nervous faces.

1608
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,760
Everyone holding their breath...

1609
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:31,640
waiting for the Third Umpire's decision.

1610
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,080
That night...

1611
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,760
'I didn't get booze...
abused... fought...'

1612
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:37,480
'bought booze... drank...'

1613
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,120
'thought I hit something on the road...'

1614
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,840
'didn't see anything... kept driving...'

1615
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,000
'reached home... fell asleep...'

1616
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:43,880
'woke up next morning...'

1617
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,040
'read the news...'

1618
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,600
'went to find out...'

1619
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,360
'but found...'

1620
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,520
'Lady with the sacred thread.'

1621
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,200
And that's out!

1622
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,160
England win by 2 runs.

1623
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,520
'England's bowling deserves praise.'

1624
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:19,240
But I must say the Indian batters
helped them a lot.

1625
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:39,400
In this International One-day series,

1626
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,200
they lead 1--

1627
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:43,000
What's going on?

1628
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,520
I'm sorry, the English language

1629
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,480
is too understated
for my emotions right now.

1630
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:22,800
Wherever you are in the 195 countries
of the world...

1631
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:24,840
whatever the colour of your skin...

1632
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,960
whether you're Indian or English...

1633
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,600
stand up and salute...

1634
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,360
salute this game...

1635
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:33,640
which can bring out
so much passion.

1636
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:38,560
No matter who wins today...

1637
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:42,040
the real winner is walking in...

1638
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,720
wearing one glove...

1639
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:45,440
and holding a bat...

1640
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:46,840
in her only hand.

1641
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:51,160
An incredible moment in cricket.

1642
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,760
Anina at the non-striker end.

1643
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:57,080
Must take a single
to keep Anina off strike.

1644
01:57:58,920 --> 01:57:59,800
Bernadette.

1645
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,400
She sets off for a run...
Anina sends her back.

1646
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:08,640
Correct decision.

1647
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,840
3 runs to get for India.

1648
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,360
1 wicket to get for England.

1649
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:18,200
Anina taking guard.

1650
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:22,640
I love this game.

1651
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:26,160
Just love it!

1652
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:35,400
The whole stadium reverberating.

1653
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,880
Evans from the Pavilion End,
to Anina.

1654
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,800
The ball has beaten her bat

1655
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:53,400
and the noise is for a 100.

1656
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:56,000
Captain Williams bringing
the fielders in.

1657
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:59,160
Attacking field.

1658
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:02,360
Anina.

1659
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:07,280
Evans...

1660
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:12,600
This is heart breaking.

1661
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:13,680
No.

1662
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,920
This is sport.

1663
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,000
This is what makes life worth living.

1664
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,040
'Whether you go right to left,
or left to right...'

1665
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:26,480
'Anina is Anina.'

1666
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,680
She's taking a left-hander's stance.

1667
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:33,280
Only a third man to stop a lucky edge.

1668
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:35,720
Everybody else around the bat.

1669
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,680
Can she get an edge?

1670
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:39,640
Can she survive?

1671
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:27,920
"Raise a toast to yourself"

1672
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,680
"To your spirit"

1673
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,840
"And spin..."

1674
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,200
"Ignore what the world says"

1675
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,280
"Salute yourself"

1676
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,040
"And spin..."

1677
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:46,160
"March in victory"

1678
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,520
"Script your victory"

1679
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,840
"And dream higher"

1680
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,840
"Stand tall"

1681
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:57,680
"Stride strong"

1682
02:00:58,040 --> 02:01:00,280
"Towards your goal"

1683
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:04,600
"Spin, spin, spin
Spin like a Ghoomer"

1684
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,640
"Spin your fate around"

1685
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,560
"May this crazy world
dance to your tune"

1686
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:16,240
"As you spin like a Ghoomer..."

1687
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,360
"And spin your fate around"

1688
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,880
"Spin, spin, spin"

1689
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:26,080
"Spin like a Ghoomer"

1690
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:33,080
"Spin, spin, spin"

1691
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,680
"Spin like a Ghoomer"

1692
02:01:57,880 --> 02:01:59,080
Rasika...

1693
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,000
dial 100...

1694
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,520
Call the police.

1695
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:11,960
Doing something wrong
and running off to prison is normal.

1696
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,160
Correcting the wrong
and then going to prison is...

1697
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:19,440
Ghoomer.

1698
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:22,800
Call the police.

1699
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,480
Say it.

1700
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,080
Sorry.

1701
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:17,640
Say it...

1702
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:21,600
Very sorry.

1703
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:24,840
Say it...

1704
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:26,520
Say it...

1705
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:28,000
I said I'm sorry.

1706
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,160
"Etch this in your soul"

1707
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:41,360
"Fulfil every dream"

1708
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:49,560
"You are light"

1709
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,920
"You are fire"

1710
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:54,720
"You are the chosen one"
