1
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:24,342
Stop, Yash. Stop.

2
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:49,456
Pranab-da's dog bit Mr Vajpayee.

3
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:53,658
Our Pranab-da? Pranab Mukherjee?

4
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:55,689
A dog bit him on his walk.

5
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,114
Oh no! Now that's 14 injections.

6
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,536
That's not written here.

7
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:02,453
He has no choice. What is it?

8
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,832
- There's eggplant on the pen.
- So?

9
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:06,974
I told you not to come
at lunchtime.

10
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:10,084
Eggplant! It's not poison, is it?

11
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:11,602
Strange fellow.

12
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,545
- Who eats eggplant every day?
- Well, I do.

13
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:16,126
Every day?

14
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:17,525
I like it.

15
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:18,919
Careful.

16
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,103
What's this?

17
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:24,705
- Well?
- An invitation.

18
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,662
- To what?
- The World Cup.

19
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:28,106
Really?

20
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:31,100
The dacoit Phoolan Devi
is surrendering.

21
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:34,003
- I hear she's beautiful.
- There's no photo.

22
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,426
Look! The launch of the Maruti car.

23
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:49,024
Kapil Dev, Mohinder Amarnath,

24
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:52,993
Madan Lal, Kirti Azad,
Sunil Valson.

25
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,895
Why are you taking their
bags with you, Mr Singh?

26
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:59,773
Because they're already in England,
playing County Cricket.

27
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:00,893
Congrats.

28
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:03,347
You mean they've replaced Gavaskar
with this guy as captain?

29
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,061
Hey!

30
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,495
- Can he do it?
- Sure, he can.

31
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,953
That also in England?

32
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:08,838
He can't even speak
English properly.

33
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:12,192
But he plays cricket well.

34
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:13,478
So what?

35
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,535
When are you back, Mr Singh?

36
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:18,705
When there are no more
matches for us to play.

37
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:21,800
The East Africans aren't playing.
So, who will you defeat?

38
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,736
The Cricket Board isn't even
hosting a farewell party.

39
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,480
Good luck!
Take care. See you.

40
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,450
We'll celebrate when we're back.

41
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,116
Celebrate what?

42
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:36,743
Good luck, Mr Singh.

43
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:38,679
All the best.

44
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,770
Well bowled, Kaps!

45
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:18,221
Mr Dev, your call to India
is connected, sir.

46
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:21,877
Hello, Romi.

47
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:26,421
Romi's out right now, Kuku.
Talk to me instead.

48
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:28,906
What will be happening here?

49
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,950
Half the kids are drinking milk.
The others are playing cricket.

50
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:35,725
You should play cricket all day
and drink gallons of milk.

51
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:37,881
A call from London?
And you didn't tell me?

52
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:41,681
Pinky, Happi, Guddo! Come,
a call from London.

53
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:44,094
And you... Meshi!
Call Kake too.

54
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:45,469
Come here!

55
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,652
Give me the phone.

56
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:50,526
Hello, Kuku!

57
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Yes, Mama.

58
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:54,502
- Are you wearing your sweater?
- <i>Yes, Mama. I will.</i>

59
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:58,103
Son, win the Cup and come home.

60
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,491
Yes, Mama.

61
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,987
Tell me.

62
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:04,200
Hello.

63
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,574
Hello.

64
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:06,482
Hello.

65
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:07,978
Hello.

66
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,561
The line's cut.

67
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,355
I didn't get a chance to talk.

68
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:22,501
Kaps, catch!

69
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,506
Impossible!

70
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:27,962
If Kapil catches it, I'll do
anything he wants me to.

71
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:33,970
- Sorry, sorry. That was tough.
- Jimmy said,

72
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,174
if you catch it, you can ask
for anything.

73
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:40,771
I'll ask him to teach me English
before the World Cup starts.

74
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:44,316
Asking for my life
would be easier!

75
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:47,441
That reminds me.
Did you talk to Lala-ji today?

76
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:50,880
- I'll do it now. Hold this.
- Give him my regards.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,203
He isn't scared of the world's
fastest bowlers,

78
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,698
but trembles when he hears
Lala-ji's name.

79
00:06:56,422 --> 00:07:00,166
Lala-ji, they're not playing
proper cricket.

80
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,858
60 overs. Start in the morning
finish in the evening.

81
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:06,029
Carry on like this and the game
will be reduced to 10 or 20 overs.

82
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,310
Sharma-ji, what nonsense!

83
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,260
- Mr Jimmy is on the line.
- He'll live a hundred years.

84
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:14,835
Hello, Jimmy, my son.
How are you?

85
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,739
<i>I'm sending you two bottles
of pickle with Yash.</i>

86
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:22,607
Mr Singh, why do you have
so many bottles of pickle?

87
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:25,044
Opening a store in London?

88
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:28,297
The food's so bland there.

89
00:07:28,504 --> 00:07:31,082
Can't eat without pickles.

90
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:34,648
Well, sir, you'll have to pay
excess baggage.

91
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:36,889
Or leave some behind.

92
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:39,882
Give me a receipt.

93
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,672
Maan, we're vegetarians.

94
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,710
How will we eat there?

95
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,132
That's 5800-rupees.

96
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,512
But, sir, I don't have
that much on me.

97
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:52,457
Here.

98
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:55,446
Ask your office to pay
the money tomorrow.

99
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:57,158
Yes.

100
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,559
Mr Singh! Will you do me a favour?

101
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,425
- Can you get me an autograph?
- You can ask them now.

102
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:05,256
No, no.

103
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:06,789
I mean Viv Richards.

104
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,108
Please try.

105
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,110
Don't forget.

106
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,860
Thank you very much.

107
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:18,129
I'll get you Queen Elizabeth's
autograph too. You fool!

108
00:08:19,414 --> 00:08:20,845
Sunil Gavaskar.

109
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,180
Syed Kirmani.

110
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,010
Yashpal Sharma.

111
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:33,806
Krishnamachari Srikkanth.

112
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,491
Dilip Vengsarkar.

113
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:39,483
Roger Binny.

114
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:42,167
Balwinder Singh Sandhu.

115
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:45,081
Sandeep Patil.

116
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,002
Ravi Shastri.

117
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,311
PR Man Singh.

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,422
Where's our team bus?

119
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,492
No, no. No bus here
for Indian team.

120
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:42,119
You mean on flight only?
When?

121
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:46,499
Rascal! You just got engaged.

122
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,629
Not for you.

123
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:50,635
The bus is here.

124
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,548
- Tell me more.
- Let's get on the bus.

125
00:09:55,614 --> 00:10:00,433
- Did something happen?
- None of your business.

126
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,558
Tell me!

127
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:05,238
Patla told the airhostess
on our flight:

128
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:06,957
"Hi, I'm Sandeep Patil.

129
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,180
Sandy to you."

130
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,407
Then Yashpal says,

131
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:12,409
"Hi, I'm Yash to you."

132
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:15,684
The rascal added if India wins
the World Cup,

133
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:17,794
he'll eat this newspaper.

134
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:22,088
Ballu was next. And you know
what he said?

135
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,738
He says to her:
"Hi, I'm Balwinder Singh Sandhu."

136
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:27,880
"Balls to you!"

137
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:30,276
Listen, everyone.

138
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,936
Listen, everyone.

139
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,201
Today for the vegetarians, there's
only bread, butter and salad.

140
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:41,778
Why look at me, Cheeka?

141
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,248
- We'll sort it out tomorrow.
- Listen, soldiers!

142
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:47,539
Welcome to London!

143
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:53,153
We must play four warm-up matches
before the tournament.

144
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,971
Let's show them what
we're made of.

145
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,200
<i>This moment is frozen in time</i>

146
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:14,250
<i>A glorious dream is a few steps away</i>

147
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,579
- What?
- South Indian.

148
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,109
What's this rubbish you're eating?
Five, ten, fifteen.

149
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:39,070
<i>Today belongs to you.</i>

150
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:44,803
Go outside.

151
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,160
Hello, Simran.

152
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,774
- Did you get there safely?
- Yes, I'm in London.

153
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,658
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

154
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:55,469
The airhostess served us lunch.
Very nice.

155
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,438
"Nice?" The airhostess?

156
00:11:57,558 --> 00:11:59,037
No, the food was nice.

157
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:03,133
<i>Cross the bumpy roads ahead</i>

158
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:04,830
Good ball, Kaps.

159
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,288
What a shot! It's a boundary, bro.

160
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,052
Inswinger.

161
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:16,138
Easy, Cheeka.
It's only net practice.

162
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,641
When I hit, I hit hard.

163
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,344
I don't know how to play defence.

164
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:23,063
I know only hitting.
Go, go bowl.

165
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:25,811
Kapil, I'll end up hitting his head.

166
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,720
He doesn't know defence.

167
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,619
Mr Man Singh, how may I help you?

168
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:36,336
This pass says entry to all
stadiums except Lord's.

169
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,006
But India doesn't have any game
at Lord's.

170
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,419
But the Finals are at Lord's,
right?

171
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:48,406
So Mr Man Singh, if and when
India reaches the Final,

172
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:50,354
we shall happily issue you the pass.

173
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,056
OK.

174
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:04,956
Inswinger.

175
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:11,248
When you bowl an inswinger,
must you telegram the batsman?

176
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:15,405
Hide your grip.
Come on! Again.

177
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:31,888
That's good.

178
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,690
Where were you, brother?

179
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:39,195
- Learning a lesson.
- What lesson?

180
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,932
Just that we may have gained
our independence 35 years ago,

181
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,139
but we haven't yet won respect,
Captain.

182
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,099
Ballu.

183
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,481
A girl? In Ballu's room?

184
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:19,399
Yes! She must've just showered
because her hair was wet.

185
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,479
- And Ballu?
- Must have been in the shower?

186
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:25,962
Why weren't they bathing together?

187
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,082
I'll find out.

188
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:28,744
Do you plan to rub their backs
with soap?

189
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,506
No! It can't be Ballu.

190
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,351
It just can't be him.

191
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:37,279
He just got engaged to Simran.

192
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:39,261
There was a girl near the nets.

193
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,624
Maybe it was her.

194
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,689
Kaps...

195
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,149
Thank you, Kaps.

196
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,296
What is it?

197
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:15,610
Catch!

198
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,879
<i>Another wicket down for India.</i>

199
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,733
<i>They're looking in trouble here.</i>

200
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,009
Just 82 for 5.

201
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:48,054
Not a very good start to
their World Cup preparations.

202
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:49,693
The team is hopeless.

203
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,012
Don't lose face here.

204
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:54,336
We'll be disgraced.

205
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:57,546
At least win one match. Just one.

206
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:01,556
Kapil Dev!

207
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:03,571
Kapil Dev!

208
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,853
Autograph, please.

209
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,844
I'm a fast bowler too.

210
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,716
- Do you drink milk too?
- Yes.

211
00:16:17,836 --> 00:16:20,643
If you come to watch the match,
then cheer loudly.

212
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:23,731
But I can't come.

213
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:27,138
Because Papa says India never wins,

214
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,996
so why waste precious money
on tickets.

215
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:41,698
Kapil, in the run up
to the World Cup,

216
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:43,719
your team has lost
3 practice matches.

217
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,936
One against a minor county.

218
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,842
You talk...

219
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:53,226
You talk like fast bowler.

220
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,611
Can you talk slow like spin bowler?

221
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,701
My hand little tight in English.

222
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:05,856
What do you think your team's
chances are in the World Cup?

223
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,911
We here to win!

224
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:13,456
To win the World Cup?

225
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:17,832
What else we here for?

226
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,185
In the history of the World Cup,

227
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,443
the West Indies haven't lost
a match.

228
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,716
Not one!

229
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,273
Michael Holding.

230
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:35,196
He's known as "Whispering Death."

231
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,492
It's like a bullet,
if it hits you

232
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:43,527
you're dead.

233
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:46,980
That's Andy Roberts.

234
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:49,305
He's called the "Hitman".

235
00:17:50,565 --> 00:17:52,779
He kills them one by one.

236
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:06,075
Kapil, tomorrow you're meeting the
Queen at Buckingham Palace.

237
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:07,538
What will you say to her?

238
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,903
I'll get her blessings, so
we will win the World Cup.

239
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,544
And that's Marshall.

240
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,859
The shortest, but the fastest.

241
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:29,156
And there's Big Bird.
Joel Garner.

242
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:33,568
He's 6ft 8".

243
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:37,780
His outstretched hand is 3ft,
then he jumps 2ft,

244
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:40,410
so his ball comes at you
from a height of 12 feet.

245
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:44,146
And at 150kms per hour.
Time to run for cover!

246
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,625
Shut up!

247
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,234
Is this cricket or a horror film?

248
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,906
Why scare everyone?

249
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:53,650
No, no. Sir, no!

250
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,686
Kapil was just being enthusiastic.

251
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:59,361
Our return is confirmed for June 20th,

252
00:18:59,481 --> 00:19:01,078
before the semi-finals.

253
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:03,354
<i>Talk later. I'm off to
Buckingham Palace.</i>

254
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,403
<i>There's a protocol meeting.</i>

255
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:08,295
Once the Queen approaches
the players,

256
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,649
she will extend her hand out
to them.

257
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:15,909
They must hold the tip
of her fingers gently,

258
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,160
and make a small bow
from the neck.

259
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,214
Like this.

260
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,887
The team will then proceed to Lord's

261
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,783
for the traditional team photographs.

262
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:29,066
Once you've said, "Your Majesty,"

263
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:33,614
make sure you hold only the tips
of her fingers. Elegantly.

264
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:36,914
Don't grab hold of her hand.
Got it?

265
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:39,181
Now where do we find elegance?

266
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,370
You must have some!
Just look for it!

267
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,889
Maan, we're nervous and you think
it's funny?

268
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,667
A waste of time.

269
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,313
Are we here to play cricket,
or to act in a Shakespeare play?

270
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:51,799
Long live the Queen!

271
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:55,633
Guys, it's tradition.
The Queen will wish you luck.

272
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,334
- Yes.
- The Brit is talking!

273
00:19:57,454 --> 00:19:59,403
Roger, when you meet the Queen,

274
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,866
tell her your grandfather
was Scottish. She'll be happy.

275
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:05,763
- Shut up, you bugger.
- You burger!

276
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,878
Hey, Cheeka. Watch it!

277
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:11,628
Don't wink at the Queen.

278
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:14,957
- Or you'll land up in jail.
- Shut up!

279
00:20:15,077 --> 00:20:17,389
I'm serious.

280
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,989
I'm wearing a new wig for her.

281
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:23,579
Looking smart, Kiri.

282
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,050
Is this all right, Your Majesty?

283
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,474
Yes.

284
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:31,670
<i>Just do whatever Kiri does.</i>

285
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:36,165
Sunil Valson, heart of our team.

286
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:37,829
Best of luck.

287
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,862
Mohinder Amarnath, Vice-Captain he is.

288
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,878
- Your Majesty.
- Best of luck.

289
00:20:44,998 --> 00:20:46,227
Thank you.

290
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:48,247
Sunil Gavaskar.

291
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,671
He don't need no introduction.

292
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:52,420
I've seen you play before.

293
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,386
Your Majesty, an honour.

294
00:20:55,335 --> 00:20:57,665
Wicket keeper, Syed Kirmani.

295
00:20:58,689 --> 00:20:59,939
Your Majesty.

296
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,843
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

297
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:06,777
Srikkanth, opening batsman.

298
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:09,425
He not know meaning of defence.

299
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,996
- Your Majesty.
- Best of luck.

300
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:22,803
Madan Lal, all-rounder.

301
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,186
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

302
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:27,754
Imran.

303
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:30,373
- How are you, Kapil?
- All good.

304
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:32,842
How's practice?

305
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,876
Hello, sir. Myself Srikkanth.

306
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,599
I'm from the Indian cricket team.

307
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,092
Holding, sir.

308
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:43,906
Clive sir. Nice to meet you.

309
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:46,129
Sir, big fan!

310
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,731
- Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

311
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:56,223
Gentlemen, line up, please.

312
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,806
- Maan, let's go.
- We'll stand in the usual order.

313
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:04,755
Time for the photograph.

314
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:15,197
Hey, giant! No one will see me.

315
00:22:15,438 --> 00:22:16,537
Everybody, look into the lens.

316
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:18,322
Stand aside, Maan.

317
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:50,768
Can I say something, Captain?

318
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:56,362
You're the first man who said
we will win.

319
00:22:56,482 --> 00:23:01,038
The journalists kept firing
questions at you

320
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:02,754
and you kept saying:

321
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,826
"We will win!"

322
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,030
A true freedom fighter!

323
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,426
Ever since I was a kid,
my mother told me:

324
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:13,863
"Win and come back home, son!"

325
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,783
No best of luck! Just win.

326
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,814
Bravo! Inspiration.

327
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:22,351
Inspire the whole team as well.

328
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:24,786
The hotel is quite far away.

329
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,302
We have a match tomorrow.

330
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,578
Let's have a meeting.

331
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:29,623
Why? Everyone knows what
they're supposed to do.

332
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,711
Tomorrow's the first World Cup match.

333
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:34,124
Captain, we should talk.

334
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:38,739
Maan, I don't know how
to give a speech.

335
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,173
Listen, everyone. Hey!

336
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:43,473
Team meeting!

337
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:47,731
There are seven senior players here.

338
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:48,638
What I can say?

339
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:50,975
Gentleman! The Captain.

340
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:07,324
Tomorrow, match very important.

341
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:14,022
Cheeka, you hit!

342
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:15,451
OK, brother.

343
00:24:15,578 --> 00:24:17,871
Dilip, you strong.

344
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:21,104
Kirti, you focus.

345
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:22,447
Your problem there.

346
00:24:22,976 --> 00:24:25,457
Sandy, hit them hard.

347
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:29,402
Yash, you're a lion.

348
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:35,121
Kiri, you'll be the wicket keeper.

349
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,607
That's what I do in every match, Kaps.

350
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,072
Enough?

351
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:46,481
Inspiration!

352
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:52,821
Like people says,

353
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,261
taste the success once,

354
00:24:58,169 --> 00:24:59,704
tongue want more!

355
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,111
Captain.

356
00:25:08,384 --> 00:25:09,986
Remember what your mother told you.

357
00:25:11,455 --> 00:25:16,356
Just come home a winner!

358
00:25:19,324 --> 00:25:20,813
Thank you.

359
00:25:28,148 --> 00:25:30,114
I think team meeting is over.

360
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:37,129
<i>I don't know what you say,</i>

361
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:40,121
<i>I don't know what he say</i>

362
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:43,183
<i>I don't know what you say,</i>

363
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,122
<i>I don't know what you say,</i>

364
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:49,065
<i>I want to dance and play</i>

365
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:52,050
<i>I want to dance and play</i>

366
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,200
<i>I want to play the game
of cricket</i>

367
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,721
<i>I want to play the game
of cricket</i>

368
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:02,914
<i>The historical field at Old Trafford.</i>

369
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:08,145
<i>Today is India's first match
in the World Cup.</i>

370
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:11,032
<i>They're up against the champions,
West Indies.</i>

371
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,161
<i>Both teams are ready to enter
the ground.</i>

372
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:17,140
- <i>- But rain is causing a delay.</i>
- Oh no, it's raining there.

373
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,683
<i>There's one thing we do know,</i>

374
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:23,820
<i>India have never won a single
game in the World Cup.</i>

375
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,794
<i>Unless you chose to remember that
game against East Africa</i>

376
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:31,289
<i>in 1975.</i>

377
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:32,409
I would count that.

378
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,276
I was Man of the Match in that game.

379
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,231
- Oh, I had forgotten.
- Ah, now you know.

380
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:39,625
<i>But the fact is, my dear friend,</i>

381
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:41,507
the West Indies are here to win

382
00:26:41,627 --> 00:26:43,796
<i>this Cup for the third time in a row.</i>

383
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,574
<i>The rain gods have probably saved</i>

384
00:26:46,694 --> 00:26:49,325
<i>the Indians from facing a crushing defeat.</i>

385
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:14,713
<i>So the covers are coming off
and play should begin soon.</i>

386
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,851
<i>I guess the Indians didn't pray enough.</i>

387
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:18,542
<i>It's stopped raining.</i>

388
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:21,855
- Shut the idiot up!
- Let them speak.

389
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,533
<i>The World Champions are stepping</i>

390
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:25,932
<i>onto the ground to a rousing reception</i>

391
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:27,619
<i>- by their legions of fans.</i>
- Sunshine!

392
00:27:27,696 --> 00:27:31,878
<i>India is in Group B along
with two World Cup giants...</i>

393
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,157
<i>The 4th team, Zimbabwe, are playing</i>

394
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:36,576
<i>Australia today at Trent Bridge.</i>

395
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,194
It's me or the West Indies.

396
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,536
<i>Windy conditions and a moist wicket</i>

397
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:42,697
<i>will add sideways movement</i>

398
00:27:42,817 --> 00:27:45,018
<i>to the lethal West Indies attack.</i>

399
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,867
<i>This will be no easy task
for the opening batsmen,</i>

400
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:51,788
<i>Sunil Gavaskar and
Krishnamachari Srikkanth.</i>

401
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,512
Sunny, why is the wicket keeper
standing so far away?

402
00:27:58,058 --> 00:28:00,572
Hey, man. Why you standing
so far from the wicket, man?

403
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:02,251
You'll soon find out, man.

404
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:03,531
You'll soon find out.

405
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:05,302
"Find out?"
Find out what?

406
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,448
- Good luck, Cheeka.
- Good luck, Sunny.

407
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,997
<i>World Cup, 1983!
India's first match.</i>

408
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:14,809
<i>They're playing against the West Indies,
the strongest team in the world.</i>

409
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,972
Make him smell the leather, Mikey.

410
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,432
Play!

411
00:28:35,608 --> 00:28:36,818
Well bowled, Mikey.

412
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:38,083
Well bowled.

413
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:39,760
Too good for him.

414
00:28:41,372 --> 00:28:42,372
Get it?

415
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:48,648
Too quick, Mikey.

416
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,243
He can't see the ball.

417
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,325
<i>This is the first time Srikkanth
is playing against the West Indies.</i>

418
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,856
Make him smell the ball, Mikey.

419
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:08,622
Let's get him.

420
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:18,739
Too fast for him, Mikey.

421
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:20,102
What happened, man?

422
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:21,742
Too fast for you?

423
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:26,246
<i>Now the ball is in Andy Roberts's hands.</i>

424
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:29,691
<i>Facing him is India's renowned
batsman, Sunil Gavaskar.</i>

425
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:33,898
<i>The Indian batsmen are being
severely restricted by the bowlers.</i>

426
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:36,614
They really need to breakout now.

427
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,524
- Catch it!
- That's the first one, Mikey.

428
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:44,499
<i>Catches the outside edge.
An easy caught behind.</i>

429
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,134
<i>Srikkanth made 14 runs
and is out!</i>

430
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:54,103
- Catch it!
- Howzat?

431
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:57,021
Got him.

432
00:29:57,076 --> 00:30:00,410
<i>India is in big trouble now. Two
wickets down in quick succession.</i>

433
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,780
<i>I don't think the Indians can
quite see the ball, Farokh.</i>

434
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,685
<i>It's moving too fast for them.</i>

435
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:09,322
Not a single boundary
for India till now.

436
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,541
Can you see the scoreboard?

437
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:17,621
Why do we bother?

438
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,976
<i>Yashpal faces Garner's bowling.</i>

439
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,280
<i>Brilliant shot!</i>

440
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:27,346
<i>Yashpal hits a beautiful cover drive.</i>

441
00:30:27,466 --> 00:30:29,814
<i>The ball crosses the
boundary like a bullet.</i>

442
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:34,621
<i>Yashpal Sharma has hit
India's first boundary.</i>

443
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:49,560
<i>Another four! Great batting by
these two players.</i>

444
00:30:50,336 --> 00:30:51,950
That's his 'baadaam' shot.

445
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,588
His signature shot!

446
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,752
<i>India have recovered from
their shaky start.</i>

447
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,977
- Yash is hitting well.
- Yes.

448
00:30:57,787 --> 00:30:59,036
What do you say now?

449
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,026
Sharma and Patil seem to be
seeing the ball pretty well.

450
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,480
Well, yes. I would have
to agree with that.

451
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,127
Gomy!

452
00:31:07,404 --> 00:31:09,459
<i>Yashpal is playing pace well.</i>

453
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:11,915
<i>Clive has now brought in a spinner.</i>

454
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,770
<i>Gomes is coming in to bowl.</i>

455
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,658
<i>Sharma hits him too!</i>

456
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,078
<i>He sweeps it to deep square leg.</i>

457
00:31:21,198 --> 00:31:22,478
<i>Holding can't get there in time.</i>

458
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:24,766
- That's it, guys.
- Good shot. Yash, son.

459
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:28,282
<i>Patil hits a straight drive over
the bowler's head.</i>

460
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:29,602
<i>The ball crosses the boundary.</i>

461
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:32,915
<i>What a partnership between
Yashpal and Patil!</i>

462
00:31:33,397 --> 00:31:36,969
<i>Patil is clean bowled by Gomes.</i>

463
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,457
<i>The Haryana hurricane,
Kapil Dev, walks in.</i>

464
00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:47,488
<i>The score is 125/4.</i>

465
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:51,883
<i>Gomes coming into bowl.</i>

466
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:55,764
<i>Kapil hits it for a quick single.</i>

467
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:59,293
<i>Great shot by Yashpal! 4 runs.</i>

468
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,913
- Catch it.
- Yeah.

469
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:07,442
<i>Kapil Dev heads to the pavilion.
He's out with only 6 runs.</i>

470
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,840
Oh no! Kapil is out for only six runs.

471
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:15,176
Oh, get it.

472
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,115
That's it.

473
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,347
<i>50 runs up for Yashpal Sharma.</i>

474
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:39,657
<i>That's on the pads.</i>

475
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:42,997
<i>India now 214/6.</i>

476
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:58,256
Come on!

477
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,876
<i>Clean bowled! Ending a game
changing play by Yashpal.</i>

478
00:33:04,013 --> 00:33:06,397
<i>A well-deserved standing ovation.</i>

479
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,877
<i>A great innings.</i>

480
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:13,068
<i>India now at 243/7.</i>

481
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:19,387
<i>That knock by Yashpal was truly
not expected, was it?</i>

482
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:20,923
<i>9 boundaries.</i>

483
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,856
<i>It's the highest score by
an Indian batsman in any World Cup.</i>

484
00:33:23,976 --> 00:33:26,839
<i>Looks like the Indians want to
be taken seriously this time.</i>

485
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,783
<i>262 for 8.</i>

486
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,582
That's a good score
put up by the Indian batsmen!

487
00:33:31,754 --> 00:33:32,754
<i>Wouldn't you say?</i>

488
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:35,235
<i>Well, yes, but that basically means</i>

489
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,680
<i>the West Indies middle order will
also get some batting practice today.</i>

490
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,183
<i>Kapil to Greenidge.</i>

491
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:45,867
<i>West Indies get off the mark.</i>

492
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,093
<i>That's a great shot.</i>

493
00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:53,064
<i>And it's a boundary!</i>

494
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,170
<i>Sandhu to Greenidge.</i>

495
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:59,591
<i>Smashing cover drive for 4!</i>

496
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:04,981
<i>Yashpal throws the ball
from the covers. It's a direct hit.</i>

497
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:06,436
<i>And Haynes is out.</i>

498
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:08,423
<i>That's an important wicket for India.</i>

499
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,774
<i>And in walks probably the greatest</i>

500
00:34:15,894 --> 00:34:18,717
<i>batsman in the world today, Richards.</i>

501
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:32,429
<i>Kapil to Viv.</i>

502
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,709
<i>Madan Lal stops it at short square leg</i>

503
00:34:36,881 --> 00:34:39,018
<i>and it's just a single.</i>

504
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,214
<i>That's a brilliant square cut by Viv.</i>

505
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:45,684
<i>Richards is making this look too easy.</i>

506
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,516
Rain, gentlemen.

507
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:04,177
Ballu, tell him you'll deal
with him tomorrow.

508
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:06,728
Drop it! Why make trouble?

509
00:35:06,848 --> 00:35:07,885
Tell him.

510
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,392
He won't forget it when he faces
your bowling.

511
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,045
He'll be shit scared.

512
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:14,502
Scared? Madipaa, he's Viv Richards!

513
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:15,749
He whacks so hard.

514
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:16,967
Even the ball gets terrified.

515
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:20,594
- Scared? As if!
- So what if he's Viv Richards?

516
00:35:20,776 --> 00:35:22,614
Remember what Kaps said?

517
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,579
Don't be scared. Just tell him.

518
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,757
Go on!

519
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:29,957
Hey, listen.

520
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,310
What do I say?

521
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:34,939
"I'll deal with you tomorrow."

522
00:35:36,096 --> 00:35:37,468
See you tomorrow!

523
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,550
Yeah, man.

524
00:35:42,413 --> 00:35:44,743
- You're mine.
- Careful what you ask for, man.

525
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:47,726
Now drop it!

526
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:48,699
Want to sing him a lullaby?

527
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:50,105
<i>Well, that's what you call luck.</i>

528
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:51,523
<i>Saved by the rain.</i>

529
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:53,861
<i>It looked like Viv Richards
was single-handedly</i>

530
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:56,177
<i>going to take that game away
from the Indians.</i>

531
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:58,512
The game resumes tomorrow.

532
00:35:58,994 --> 00:36:00,294
Let's see what happens.

533
00:36:05,322 --> 00:36:07,165
The match is starting.

534
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:13,221
<i>Second day of play.
Richards on strike</i>

535
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:15,884
<i>and Roger Binny to begin
India's bowling attack.</i>

536
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:18,259
<i>Let's see what Viv does today.</i>

537
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:24,061
<i>Binny running in on this overcast day.</i>

538
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:27,117
<i>Kirmani catches it and
Viv Richards is out for 17.</i>

539
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,661
<i>Richards is back in the pavilion.</i>

540
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,830
Didn't I tell you, Ballu?

541
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:45,459
Hey, you!

542
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:46,944
Get back to work.

543
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,564
You had the day off yesterday!

544
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:50,025
Go on.

545
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:52,899
<i>Madan Lal bowls out Bacchus.</i>

546
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,502
<i>What a brilliant delivery!</i>

547
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:58,315
<i>Binny to Dujon and he's caught
by Sandhu.</i>

548
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:01,254
<i>West Indies struggling at 107/5.</i>

549
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:03,658
<i>Shastri to Gomes.</i>

550
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,536
<i>Batsman are going for the second.</i>

551
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:07,656
<i>Sandhu gets the ball.</i>

552
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:09,391
<i>And that's a brilliant run out.</i>

553
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:11,587
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

554
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,583
<i>The mighty West Indies are crumbling.</i>

555
00:37:20,398 --> 00:37:24,949
<i>The champions are
in trouble at 157/9.</i>

556
00:37:25,461 --> 00:37:27,419
Big Bird Joel Garner is the last man in,

557
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,474
but 106 runs are still needed to win.

558
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:34,774
<i>That's a big 6 over mid-wicket.</i>

559
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,796
<i>This is the same Andy Roberts who, in 1975,</i>

560
00:37:38,977 --> 00:37:41,066
<i>together with Deryck Murray</i>

561
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:44,013
<i>added 64 runs for a 10th wicket
partnership.</i>

562
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,834
<i>They made their team win.</i>

563
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:49,040
<i>Looks like Andy Roberts
and Joel Garner</i>

564
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,651
<i>intend to perform the
same miracle today.</i>

565
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:54,917
<i>The West Indies need only
34 runs to win.</i>

566
00:37:55,622 --> 00:37:58,815
Kaps, get Shastri back.

567
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,646
They can't play slow spin.

568
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:06,954
<i>Shastri has been called back.</i>

569
00:38:07,074 --> 00:38:09,008
<i>That could be a big risk.</i>

570
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:10,564
<i>The game is at a crucial point.</i>

571
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:13,431
<i>The West Indies need 34 runs
off 36 balls.</i>

572
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:21,158
<i>India has done the unthinkable.</i>

573
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,155
They've defeated the unbeatable.

574
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:26,177
The invincible West Indies!

575
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:38,387
<i>I was away working for 12 years.</i>

576
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,513
<i>I returned with a ring.</i>

577
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:53,430
<i>India has won!</i>

578
00:38:54,105 --> 00:38:59,219
<i>It's time to dance and sing.</i>

579
00:39:25,498 --> 00:39:28,915
Will Kaps get angry with us?
Tomorrow we're playing a match.

580
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:31,207
How will he find out?

581
00:39:31,332 --> 00:39:33,335
He must've had his milk
and gone to sleep.

582
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,978
Let's go!

583
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,088
Tomorrow's a match day.

584
00:39:44,636 --> 00:39:46,051
Fix your hair.

585
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,682
Where to, gang?

586
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:54,361
We've won the first World Cup match.
Why not celebrate?

587
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:56,457
- You coming?
- No, sir.

588
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:59,883
I'm captain in the day.
Patla is the night Captain.

589
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,498
They aren't as experienced
as you are on fast pitches.

590
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:06,981
Put your helmet on.

591
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:16,540
If I see someone yawning tomorrow,
they've had it.

592
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,290
Kirti, you trouble-maker!

593
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:22,582
Where are you going, Kaps?

594
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:26,540
The ball has stained my trousers.
It look bad.

595
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:29,665
- I'm taking it to the laundry.
- Has your family sent you money?

596
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,415
We get only £15 a day.

597
00:40:35,004 --> 00:40:37,183
Laundry will cost you about £12.

598
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,415
Buy a new pair of trousers
instead.

599
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:43,107
- So?
- Wash them yourself.

600
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:48,415
I haven't even washed a hanky
in my life.

601
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,150
Nor have you wiped out the
West Indies team!

602
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:56,503
There's a first for everything.

603
00:40:56,623 --> 00:41:00,087
<i>Being young is a carefree time</i>

604
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,888
<i>We're ready to falter and fall</i>

605
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:07,165
<i>This no age anyway</i>

606
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,786
<i>To be all grown up</i>

607
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:15,082
<i>Crazy thoughts flood all our hearts</i>

608
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:19,045
<i>Let's cross all boundaries</i>

609
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:22,082
<i>This no age anyway</i>

610
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:24,848
<i>To be all grown up</i>

611
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,540
Jimpa, I managed it in £1.

612
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,123
Cricket teaches you many things.

613
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:38,316
<i>Why lose out on fun?</i>

614
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:42,163
<i>For fear of the others</i>

615
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:46,099
<i>So what if the world disapproves?</i>

616
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,415
<i>So be it</i>

617
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,208
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

618
00:41:52,328 --> 00:41:55,929
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

619
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:59,790
<i>We'll follow our hearts</i>

620
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:03,462
<i>And do what it says</i>

621
00:42:03,582 --> 00:42:07,170
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

622
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:10,915
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

623
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,768
<i>We'll follow our hearts</i>

624
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:18,498
<i>And do what it says</i>

625
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:22,197
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

626
00:42:22,317 --> 00:42:25,836
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

627
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,548
<i>No authority scares us</i>

628
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:34,081
<i>What's there to fear?</i>

629
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:38,373
And the man of the match, Madan Lal.

630
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:43,276
<i>India wins rather comfortably,
with 5 wickets and 23 overs to spare.</i>

631
00:42:43,457 --> 00:42:47,250
<i>With two back-to-back wins,
India now on top of Group B.</i>

632
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:52,253
<i>Let us go a little wild</i>

633
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:55,870
<i>Why be all serious now?</i>

634
00:42:56,082 --> 00:42:59,794
<i>We'll follow our hearts</i>

635
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:01,563
Cheeka!

636
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,190
Congrats.

637
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,542
Hey!

638
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:09,954
<i>What's there to fear?</i>

639
00:43:10,205 --> 00:43:11,808
I've never seen so many people.

640
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,332
Man Singh, Kapil! Fantastic!

641
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,673
- Hello, Wankhede sir.
- You won two matches!

642
00:43:22,414 --> 00:43:25,623
Mishra-ji, write a headline story
on the team.

643
00:43:25,748 --> 00:43:28,197
Sure, sir.
They've won two matches.

644
00:43:28,415 --> 00:43:31,663
Even if they had to return to
India tomorrow, it's OK.

645
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:35,457
No one's going anywhere.

646
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:39,373
You're booked to leave
on the 25th, right?

647
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:41,040
Yes.

648
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,602
What'll he do here till then?
Does Kapil want to watch the Finals?

649
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:53,498
He intends to play in the Finals.

650
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:57,582
I'm off.

651
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:02,939
"Play in the Finals!"

652
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:07,258
If we changed our tickets
from June 25th,

653
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,803
must we pay a cancellation fee?

654
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,873
Why would you care if we stayed
till the 25th?

655
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:14,873
Just tell me about
the cancellation charges.

656
00:44:15,165 --> 00:44:18,290
How much? Really!

657
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:22,893
Then don't change the booking.

658
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:27,769
I was only asking to pass time.

659
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:32,325
<i>And I can say this specially after
the fall of the first few wickets.</i>

660
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:46,373
<i>In the other match today at Leeds,
West Indies beat Australia by 101 runs.</i>

661
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:48,926
<i>An aggressive comeback after
their humiliating defeat to India.</i>

662
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,279
Brother.

663
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:52,294
Free dinner?

664
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,800
Let's go.

665
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:58,444
Ma'am, this is Kapil - Kapsy.

666
00:44:58,645 --> 00:45:00,416
Jimmy, our Vice-Captain.

667
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,582
This is Mr and Mrs Natrajan
from Madurai.

668
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:05,285
And their daughter, Kalyani.

669
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:08,900
- She cooks very well, they say.
- That's nice.

670
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:13,522
Shall we eat?

671
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,391
It's delicious.

672
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,165
The dosas are very good. Did you mix
the batter yourself?

673
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:20,409
No, we get it from India.

674
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:23,469
I've had five dosas already.

675
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:26,789
Please don't count.
This is also like your house only.

676
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,790
Kalyani enjoys cooking very much.

677
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,133
Really nice.

678
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:33,940
You've won two World Cup matches.

679
00:45:34,587 --> 00:45:36,489
Now you should marry.

680
00:45:45,981 --> 00:45:50,582
She says you've won two matches,

681
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,868
so you should settle down.

682
00:45:54,545 --> 00:45:56,207
Cheeka is well settled.

683
00:45:56,332 --> 00:46:00,358
He got married to a lovely girl
in March.

684
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,665
Didn't you tell them?

685
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:17,383
Congratulations.

686
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:20,535
Congratulations.

687
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:24,879
Thank you.

688
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,873
Did you have to tell them the truth
like Raja Harishchandra?

689
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:39,207
A few more dosas would've been nice.

690
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:43,582
- You rascal! Shall I tell Vidya?
- Kapsy!

691
00:46:44,207 --> 00:46:46,873
It's hard finding a vegetarian
South Indian family.

692
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:50,123
You can find Punjabis everywhere.

693
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:53,415
South Indian families are rare.

694
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:59,957
A wife fills the heart.
Food fills the belly.

695
00:47:00,457 --> 00:47:02,353
You can't mix the two.

696
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,222
The end of my dosas.

697
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:10,373
He missed out on dessert,
that's why he's mad.

698
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,939
- Hello.
- How are you?

699
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,373
Simran...

700
00:47:21,498 --> 00:47:24,089
Sat Sri Akal.

701
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:27,244
Say hello from me.

702
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:28,582
She says hello.

703
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:30,665
Hello-ji, sister-in-law.

704
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:34,040
We won't tell you about Julie.

705
00:47:34,165 --> 00:47:36,540
Simran, I'll call you
from the lobby.

706
00:47:36,711 --> 00:47:39,248
- These idiots are teasing me.
- Wait. Who's Julie?

707
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:41,915
There is no Julie.
He was just kidding.

708
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,457
Let me call you from the lobby.
OK?

709
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:48,332
Do you want my engagement
to be called off?

710
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:51,462
Now she won't get Julie
out of her mind.

711
00:47:51,582 --> 00:47:55,566
Julie, I love you!

712
00:47:55,832 --> 00:47:57,373
Julie speaking.

713
00:47:57,707 --> 00:47:58,913
Lala-ji!

714
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,378
Who is Julie?
No, not Julie. I said July.

715
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:10,087
Lala-ji, all the boys were sitting here.

716
00:48:10,207 --> 00:48:12,832
They want a short holiday
before going home.

717
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,035
So, we'll be back in July not June.

718
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:18,272
Everything's fine.
Do you want to talk to Jimmy?

719
00:48:19,415 --> 00:48:22,332
He isn't picking up?
One minute.

720
00:48:22,457 --> 00:48:23,707
Yes.

721
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:26,381
He was right here.

722
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:29,614
Jimmy!

723
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,349
He must be somewhere in the hotel lobby.

724
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,540
No, Lala-ji. No way.

725
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,707
He never goes out at night.

726
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,203
He's not here.

727
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,529
He's gone to sleep, Lala-ji.

728
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:43,332
Should I wake him up?

729
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,150
Hello. Papa.

730
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:06,649
What happened?

731
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:10,373
Go, look for Jimmy.

732
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:12,659
- Here he is.
- Jimpa, where were you?

733
00:49:13,082 --> 00:49:13,582
Why?

734
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:16,962
- Lala-ji called.
- You should've said I was asleep.

735
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,082
- He told me to wake you up.
- Then?

736
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,441
Then I imitated your voice, but...

737
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:22,561
But what?

738
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,748
Lala-ji said:

739
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:26,540
"Kirti, I'm not just Jimmy's father
but your father too."

740
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,124
I hung up.

741
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:30,962
Must be Lala-ji.

742
00:49:31,082 --> 00:49:33,873
I'm in trouble, thanks
to your free dosas.

743
00:49:33,998 --> 00:49:35,123
I warned you.

744
00:49:35,248 --> 00:49:36,915
Don't get trapped by free food.

745
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,430
- The dosas have cost you heavily.
- Yash, shut up.

746
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,540
What else did Lala-ji say?

747
00:49:49,832 --> 00:49:52,803
- Just keep batting.
- He must've said something else.

748
00:49:54,055 --> 00:49:57,123
Watching you is hurting my muscles.

749
00:49:57,248 --> 00:49:58,663
Go easy!

750
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,774
Look at this photographer!

751
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,480
I'm the Man of the Match
and he's photographing you.

752
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:10,707
It's simple, brother.

753
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:13,457
Whoever pops the champagne cork
gets photographed.

754
00:50:13,832 --> 00:50:15,832
They need action too.

755
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:18,712
Oh, I look handsome.

756
00:50:21,457 --> 00:50:25,165
Captain, we've won two matches.

757
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:27,998
Sure we're not overconfident?

758
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:30,832
Kapil Dev.

759
00:50:31,873 --> 00:50:33,776
Oh, fast bowler!

760
00:50:37,008 --> 00:50:39,670
You won two matches.

761
00:50:39,899 --> 00:50:42,917
I made a flag for your next match.

762
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,248
It's a beautiful.

763
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:48,920
<i>Still undefeated, India arrives at
Trent Bridge to face Australia.</i>

764
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,837
<i>Sunil Gavaskar is apparently injured
and has been left out.</i>

765
00:50:51,957 --> 00:50:53,846
<i>Can this cost them the match?</i>

766
00:50:56,832 --> 00:51:00,332
<i>Kapil Dev strikes early.
Australia are 11/1.</i>

767
00:51:02,082 --> 00:51:05,248
<i>What a shot by Chappell!
A smashing boundary.</i>

768
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,078
<i>Chappell displaying a tremendous
array of strokes.</i>

769
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,628
<i>That's been dropped.</i>

770
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:19,332
<i>Chappell given a life by Roger Binny.
This could be costly.</i>

771
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:24,248
<i>And how Chappell is punishing the
Indians for that missed opportunity.</i>

772
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:25,457
Catch it.

773
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,165
<i>The Captain clearly looks frustrated
at his players.</i>

774
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,665
<i>Too many missed opportunities.
Too many.</i>

775
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:33,832
<i>Well, I hate to say this, but the
Indians look like amateurs today.</i>

776
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,957
<i>Chappell has destroyed
the Indian bowling.</i>

777
00:51:36,082 --> 00:51:37,739
<i>He hits a well deserved century.</i>

778
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:40,322
<i>And Australia are in a commanding
position at lunch.</i>

779
00:52:02,712 --> 00:52:08,847
<i>Walking many nights towards
a dawn</i>

780
00:52:09,362 --> 00:52:15,409
<i>This is not the dawn of our dreams</i>

781
00:52:15,529 --> 00:52:17,528
<i>After some dismal
fielding from India,</i>

782
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:20,523
<i>Kapil Dev is taking the
bowling attack to Australia.</i>

783
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:23,162
Great bowling, skipper.

784
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:24,690
Congratulations on the fifer.

785
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:32,864
What's wrong, Kaps?

786
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,644
The match isn't over yet.

787
00:52:36,164 --> 00:52:40,559
You know he's pulled his
hamstring, but he's trying.

788
00:52:41,339 --> 00:52:43,546
I expect more from Roger.

789
00:52:44,526 --> 00:52:46,251
He better than that.

790
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,876
Kaps, the game is getting tough.

791
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:53,050
- We will not lose easily.
- We must win, Jimpa.

792
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:59,002
<i>Walking many nights towards
a dawn</i>

793
00:52:59,664 --> 00:53:06,496
<i>This is not the dawn of our dreams</i>

794
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:12,965
<i>The road ahead seems without end</i>

795
00:53:13,243 --> 00:53:14,515
Sorry, Jimpa.

796
00:53:14,635 --> 00:53:19,920
<i>Without Gavaskar, India's task of
chasing 321 is going to be a difficult one.</i>

797
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,029
<i>It shall not dampen our spirits</i>

798
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:26,580
<i>It shall rise again</i>

799
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,901
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

800
00:53:30,021 --> 00:53:32,618
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

801
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:36,628
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

802
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,964
<i>This spirit of ours</i>

803
00:53:55,877 --> 00:54:01,050
<i>Kapil is the only one with 5 wickets
and a 40 off 27 balls to his name.</i>

804
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:06,456
<i>The Captain did lead by example, but
India eventually loses by 162 runs.</i>

805
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,687
<i>A huge, huge crushing defeat!</i>

806
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:14,449
Kapil, a true Captain's
innings today.

807
00:54:15,813 --> 00:54:18,954
So what? We still lost
the match, Maan.

808
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:22,304
320 runs! We were hammered.

809
00:54:24,043 --> 00:54:25,385
It looked like we hardly played.

810
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:30,849
If you accept defeat early
then how will you fight?

811
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,324
If anyone is injured,
Wally will take his place.

812
00:54:42,297 --> 00:54:43,490
How is leg?

813
00:54:44,723 --> 00:54:45,940
Better.

814
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:48,773
Sunny, it high time you get run.

815
00:54:54,821 --> 00:54:57,407
Cheeka, you have to control anger.

816
00:54:57,532 --> 00:55:00,365
All the time playing rash shot.
Not require.

817
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,264
What about the fielding?

818
00:55:12,755 --> 00:55:13,804
Sunny Bhai!

819
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:15,430
Don't, Maan Bhai.

820
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:25,771
I don't understand why he's talking
to his team in English?

821
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:29,865
Do you know,

822
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:34,897
Kapil thinks in Punjabi
then translates it into English.

823
00:55:36,198 --> 00:55:41,734
What he meant was - how long will
runs hide from you?

824
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:44,365
You're going to score,
come what may.

825
00:55:45,282 --> 00:55:47,538
His English is all wrong
but his sentiment is right.

826
00:55:50,616 --> 00:55:51,907
He's right.

827
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,256
I must score.

828
00:55:57,277 --> 00:56:00,865
Not for my own sake,
but for the sake of the team.

829
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:02,579
Yes.

830
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:06,019
Kapil is the team's heart,
you are the team's balance.

831
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:11,110
They can't do without you.
He knows that too.

832
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,740
Anyway, I won't be able
to play tomorrow.

833
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:15,824
We need you tomorrow.

834
00:56:15,949 --> 00:56:19,314
You're the only one the West
Indies bowlers are scared of.

835
00:56:23,935 --> 00:56:25,200
My foot's still swollen.

836
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:27,352
- Yes, but...
- Sorry.

837
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:42,418
<i>India is going to play the defeated
West Indies again.</i>

838
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:48,282
<i>Gavaskar has proven he's the greatest
threat to the West Indies so far.</i>

839
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:52,740
<i>Kapil Dev is making a major error
by dropping him now.</i>

840
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:59,000
Skipper, my hamstring is feeling
much better now.

841
00:56:59,453 --> 00:57:01,110
Let me bowl.

842
00:57:10,436 --> 00:57:13,426
OK, Humphrey. You bowl today.

843
00:57:28,117 --> 00:57:31,310
<i>Let's be clear about this.
The West Indies want revenge.</i>

844
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,189
You can see it in their eyes.

845
00:57:33,309 --> 00:57:35,782
<i>After their great upset in the
first match of the World Cup,</i>

846
00:57:35,907 --> 00:57:39,906
<i>the West Indies want to prove that
they're the greatest team in the world.</i>

847
00:57:40,026 --> 00:57:44,307
<i>The manner in which they demolished
the Australians in their second match</i>

848
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:47,417
<i>is enough to put a chill down
the spine of any team.</i>

849
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:53,115
<i>Greenidge caught at first slip
off Kapil Dev.</i>

850
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:58,842
<i>The West Indies are 17/1. Looks like the
Indians have come ready for battle.</i>

851
00:57:59,169 --> 00:58:03,483
<i>Here comes the best batsman
in the world, Richards.</i>

852
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:25,676
<i>That should be a four.</i>

853
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:29,396
<i>No! Stopped by Binny.
Stopped a certain boundary there.</i>

854
00:58:47,218 --> 00:58:50,329
<i>Looks like Richards has
chosen this match</i>

855
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:54,251
<i>for the team's march towards
another World Cup Final.</i>

856
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:09,454
<i>A masterclass by the two greats of
International cricket.</i>

857
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:11,609
<i>Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards.</i>

858
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:22,394
<i>That's a big one! I've not seen
a ball hit so far in a long time.</i>

859
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:25,362
<i>It lands straight on the roof
of the pavilion.</i>

860
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:36,942
<i>West Indies at a massive 282.</i>

861
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:41,477
<i>Sunny seemed fit when I saw him
walk in the nets.</i>

862
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:44,287
<i>Do you think he
really has been rested?</i>

863
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:46,408
<i>The best of players go through
a bad patch.</i>

864
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:49,662
<i>And I'm sure he'll be back.
I know him. He's a great player.</i>

865
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:52,727
<i>Yes, but this is the West Indies
that they're facing.</i>

866
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:55,678
<i>And who knows them better
than Sunny Gavaskar.</i>

867
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:57,520
Come on, Andy.

868
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:09,638
<i>Andy Roberts running in to bowl.</i>

869
01:00:13,624 --> 01:00:16,022
<i>And that delivery almost took
Srikkanth's head off.</i>

870
01:00:20,914 --> 01:00:23,721
<i>Srikkanth slashes
and he's caught behind.</i>

871
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:26,182
<i>India lose an early wicket.</i>

872
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:28,701
Where you going, boss?
The pavilion's over there.

873
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:37,105
<i>Mohinder Amarnath, the next man in.</i>

874
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,688
<i>And that's another one. A big one.</i>

875
01:00:41,813 --> 01:00:44,929
<i>India have lost both their openers
in the first 10 overs.</i>

876
01:00:52,943 --> 01:00:55,039
Fiery Andy, Fiery!

877
01:00:56,888 --> 01:00:58,824
<i>That one hit Vengsarkar
right in the ribs.</i>

878
01:00:58,944 --> 01:01:02,047
<i>This looks like a battlefield,
rather than a game of cricket.</i>

879
01:01:18,027 --> 01:01:19,923
<i>India rebuilding quite well.</i>

880
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:25,785
<i>Indians thrilled by this 50-run
partnership between Jimmy and Dilip.</i>

881
01:01:25,977 --> 01:01:27,480
<i>That was a fast one from
Malcolm Marshall.</i>

882
01:01:27,504 --> 01:01:30,539
Good stuff, Maco.
Lots of fire, buddy.

883
01:01:36,232 --> 01:01:38,467
Don't worry about it, man.

884
01:01:42,646 --> 01:01:45,339
Sunny knows about me.
You'll soon find out too.

885
01:01:46,072 --> 01:01:47,173
Good shot, Dilip.

886
01:01:47,293 --> 01:01:51,160
They say he's the new Gavaskar.
Give him some respect, Maco.

887
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:57,836
<i>Dilip standing up to one of the fastest
most hostile overs seen in the World Cup.</i>

888
01:02:31,438 --> 01:02:36,530
<i>Ball after ball after ball of
hostile short-paced bowling.</i>

889
01:02:36,805 --> 01:02:39,547
<i>Dilip Vengsarkar simply could not
avoid that one.</i>

890
01:02:42,577 --> 01:02:44,362
<i>He's wincing in pain on the ground.</i>

891
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:47,450
<i>Dilip was getting on top
of the West Indian bowling.</i>

892
01:03:17,717 --> 01:03:20,633
<i>This is not the same Indian team
that landed in England,</i>

893
01:03:20,758 --> 01:03:25,056
<i>and this is not the same West Indies
team they met a week ago.</i>

894
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:35,008
A little bit faster, sir.

895
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:39,928
<i>Marshall not letting up on his pace.</i>

896
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,147
<i>Pulled away for 4 by one of the
best players of pace.</i>

897
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:12,329
<i>With Jimmy Amarnath
still at the crease,</i>

898
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:15,673
<i>there's a chance of India
taking up the challenge.</i>

899
01:04:18,575 --> 01:04:20,143
Bowler!

900
01:04:21,009 --> 01:04:23,159
And that brings up the fifty
for Amarnath.

901
01:04:23,279 --> 01:04:27,005
<i>The balls are coming like bullets, but
ever since Dilip Vengsarkar was hit,</i>

902
01:04:27,184 --> 01:04:30,560
<i>Jimmy Amarnath is giving it back
to the West Indian pacers.</i>

903
01:04:31,262 --> 01:04:32,657
<i>Gomes to Patil.</i>

904
01:04:33,779 --> 01:04:36,319
<i>And he's gone, caught
and bowled by Larry Gomes.</i>

905
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,303
<i>India now 130/3.</i>

906
01:04:40,056 --> 01:04:43,703
- Shall we leave?
- Wait. Kapil Dev is coming on.

907
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:48,926
<i>Kapil joins Jimmy on the field</i>

908
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,931
<i>at the crucial moment in the match.</i>
Kapil Dev!

909
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,494
<i>All eyes are on the Captain.</i>

910
01:04:52,614 --> 01:04:54,650
<i>The Captain is off
to a flying start.</i>

911
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:58,163
<i>India reaches 160
with four wickets down.</i>

912
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:04,687
<i>The Captain and Vice-Captain
put up a brave 50-run partnership.</i>

913
01:05:06,071 --> 01:05:08,630
<i>A valiant innings
of 80 comes to an end.</i>

914
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:11,502
<i>Battered on the elbow, chest
and even on the face.</i>

915
01:05:11,622 --> 01:05:16,248
<i>Amarnath stood and hooked bravely
at every opportunity for three hours.</i>

916
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,723
Howzat, Umpire?

917
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:21,871
<i>Roger Binny is out.</i>

918
01:05:22,449 --> 01:05:23,642
Catch it. Yeah!

919
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:26,437
<i>And what a catch!
Absolutely brilliant.</i>

920
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,259
<i>Kirmani bowled by Marshall
for a duck.</i>

921
01:05:35,776 --> 01:05:37,520
No, no, no.

922
01:05:38,774 --> 01:05:44,167
<i>India all out in the 54th over, falling
short by a huge margin of 66 runs.</i>

923
01:05:44,287 --> 01:05:45,912
<i>West Indies have had their revenge.</i>

924
01:05:46,037 --> 01:05:47,903
<i>Their key batsmen
in hitting form and</i>

925
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:50,609
<i>their fearsome pace attack
being too much for the Indians.</i>

926
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:52,623
<i>Today it looked like
a bloody battlefield.</i>

927
01:05:52,743 --> 01:05:57,150
<i>India in deep trouble now,
having lost 2 matches in a row.</i>

928
01:06:26,277 --> 01:06:27,912
Seven stitches.

929
01:06:30,436 --> 01:06:31,579
The doctor said,

930
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,672
Dilip can't play in this World Cup.

931
01:07:08,551 --> 01:07:14,008
<i>So what if the heart is broken</i>

932
01:07:14,249 --> 01:07:18,958
<i>It still beats and quickens
as before</i>

933
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:24,647
<i>Life runs through our veins</i>

934
01:07:24,767 --> 01:07:30,310
<i>We shall keep our promises</i>

935
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:35,875
<i>The desire of every heart</i>

936
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:42,909
<i>Together we shall fulfill</i>

937
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,724
Kapil Dev!

938
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:55,436
Kapil Dev!

939
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:04,591
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

940
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:10,171
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

941
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:15,914
<i>Let it fly on high</i>

942
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:21,621
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>

943
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:27,271
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

944
01:08:27,391 --> 01:08:33,064
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

945
01:08:33,184 --> 01:08:38,601
<i>Let it fly on high</i>

946
01:08:38,808 --> 01:08:45,094
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>

947
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:49,325
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

948
01:08:49,445 --> 01:08:53,391
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

949
01:09:19,378 --> 01:09:22,284
627, Kirmani, Dilip.

950
01:09:22,654 --> 01:09:24,154
Patla, found your room?

951
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:25,901
Yeah!

952
01:09:25,952 --> 01:09:29,556
Shall I ask the people in the lobby
to share the room with me?

953
01:09:30,205 --> 01:09:32,455
Why are you making
a scene, Patla?

954
01:09:32,861 --> 01:09:34,909
The wives are coming.
Please manage.

955
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:36,406
And our girlfriends?

956
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:39,006
Take them to the garden.

957
01:09:39,164 --> 01:09:41,448
Treat them to ice cream.
Whisper sweet nothings!

958
01:09:41,568 --> 01:09:44,694
Say good night then go back
to your room. OK?

959
01:09:45,552 --> 01:09:47,594
Just listen, Maan.

960
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:51,610
If you play games at night,
you'll be useless on the field.

961
01:10:23,497 --> 01:10:24,377
So sorry, Kapil.

962
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:27,419
You have a match tomorrow.
How long were you waiting?

963
01:10:27,539 --> 01:10:29,419
- Three hours.
- Three hours!

964
01:10:29,539 --> 01:10:31,030
Oh God, I'm so sorry.

965
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,419
Why was the flight so late?

966
01:10:33,539 --> 01:10:35,372
You know how it is.

967
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,747
Everything is late in India.

968
01:10:38,243 --> 01:10:40,126
I was reading an article about

969
01:10:40,246 --> 01:10:43,747
a man who applied for a
phone line 18 years ago.

970
01:10:44,012 --> 01:10:45,414
He still hasn't got it.

971
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:49,979
Just imagine, 18 years for
a phone line. Too much!

972
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:54,539
- What news back home?
- Everyone's thrilled.

973
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,289
You've won two matches.

974
01:10:57,488 --> 01:10:59,289
And we lost two.

975
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:06,164
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes, I am.

976
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:09,141
Come on.

977
01:11:16,664 --> 01:11:18,497
When I was sixteen,

978
01:11:19,038 --> 01:11:21,054
I went to the CCI camp.

979
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:25,991
We bowled all day
and got two rotis to eat.

980
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,247
I asked them: "What's this?"
I went to complain to the camp head.

981
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,561
His name was Keki Tarapore.

982
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,460
"Sir, I'm a fast bowler,
two rotis aren't enough for me."

983
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,372
He laughed.

984
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:41,289
"Son, India doesn't have
fast bowlers.

985
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,664
- "Make do with what you get."
- "Sir, I'm not here to make do."

986
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:49,330
I kept fighting and finally
I was given four rotis.

987
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:52,955
Four years later when I had taken
100 wickets,

988
01:11:53,122 --> 01:11:56,539
I went to the CCI and thanked
Mr Tarapore and said:

989
01:11:56,887 --> 01:11:59,883
"Because of you, there are
fast bowlers in India now."

990
01:12:02,372 --> 01:12:05,955
Rom, if people say:
"This Indian team is useless."

991
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:08,789
It makes no difference.
I'll give my answer on the pitch.

992
01:12:08,914 --> 01:12:12,539
But when they say:
"Kapil, you've done enough."

993
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,039
It makes me furious.

994
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:19,539
If "enough" makes them happy,
then wait 18 years for a phone.

995
01:12:20,289 --> 01:12:22,872
I'm not here to do "enough".

996
01:12:23,414 --> 01:12:26,377
When people talk like that,
I want to smash their faces.

997
01:12:26,497 --> 01:12:28,083
Hello!

998
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:30,816
Tomorrow's a big match.

999
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,414
It's a do and die.

1000
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:41,158
- What's wrong?
- You mean "Do or die"?

1001
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:43,039
Whatever!

1002
01:12:45,607 --> 01:12:47,705
Smash what you want there.

1003
01:12:54,009 --> 01:12:56,460
<i>The BBC are not
showing this match.</i>

1004
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,580
<i>Do you think that's reflection
of the fact</i>

1005
01:12:58,705 --> 01:13:01,185
<i>we're not going to see
anything exciting today, Farokh?</i>

1006
01:13:01,305 --> 01:13:04,899
<i>Well, it's a crucial match for India.
We find ourselves in a must win situation.</i>

1007
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:08,330
<i>India must be still recovering
from the double thrashing</i>

1008
01:13:08,455 --> 01:13:10,955
<i>they received from the West Indies
and Australia.</i>

1009
01:13:11,122 --> 01:13:15,205
<i>If they win today by a huge margin,
they're still in the tournament.</i>

1010
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:16,372
<i>If not, so long!</i>

1011
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:19,086
- I'm fifth down.
- <i>Happy journey India!</i>

1012
01:13:19,289 --> 01:13:21,377
Play well so I don't need to bat.

1013
01:13:21,589 --> 01:13:24,539
I'll shower now. I'll see you
at fielding.

1014
01:13:30,585 --> 01:13:33,372
- Must you make us late?
- The boys take time to come.

1015
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:36,247
We don't need them.
We're not going to war.

1016
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:37,898
We will miss the Indian batting.

1017
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,577
<i>Gavaskar at the crease. It's good
to see the Little Master back.</i>

1018
01:13:44,872 --> 01:13:46,372
<i>Rawson coming in to bowl.</i>

1019
01:13:46,705 --> 01:13:49,098
<i>And that hits his pads
and he is gone.</i>

1020
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:52,455
<i>Gavaskar goes for a duck in
the first over of the match.</i>

1021
01:13:59,674 --> 01:14:00,852
Catch!

1022
01:14:00,972 --> 01:14:04,500
<i>And what a catch!
Srikkanth also goes for a duck.</i>

1023
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,620
Kaps!

1024
01:14:05,747 --> 01:14:07,664
Kaps, it's two down.

1025
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:16,127
<i>Caught behind. And would you
believe it, India is 6 for 3.</i>

1026
01:14:16,247 --> 01:14:18,398
Kaps! Three down. Hurry up!

1027
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:22,164
Sardar, let me shower.
The water's nice and hot today.

1028
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:25,289
We're being hammered and Kaps
is happy about the hot water.

1029
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:27,292
Kaps!

1030
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,014
<i>Curran to Patil.</i>

1031
01:14:30,453 --> 01:14:32,789
<i>There is an appeal.
And he's given him.</i>

1032
01:14:32,914 --> 01:14:35,263
<i>I cannot believe what's happening
here on this ground.</i>

1033
01:14:35,789 --> 01:14:40,505
Kaps! We're four down!
I swear. Please, hurry.

1034
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,131
Nonsense. Just shut up!

1035
01:14:42,251 --> 01:14:43,729
What do you mean "shut up?"

1036
01:14:43,849 --> 01:14:45,926
It's an important match.
Stop clowning.

1037
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,977
Don't take a joke too far.

1038
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,164
- What's the score?
- 9 runs.

1039
01:14:52,038 --> 01:14:53,330
Four wickets down.

1040
01:14:54,961 --> 01:14:56,347
<i>Wickets are falling one by one.</i>

1041
01:14:56,467 --> 01:14:59,794
Didn't I tell you?
The boy hasn't got it.

1042
01:15:00,032 --> 01:15:01,039
Captain change.

1043
01:15:01,493 --> 01:15:03,497
- Let the match be over.
- It's over.

1044
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:06,399
Match is over. World Cup over.
Captain over.

1045
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:08,715
Another wicket down,
we're not going.

1046
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,094
No point.

1047
01:15:10,284 --> 01:15:12,321
<i>We're waiting for the Captain
to enter.</i>

1048
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:15,158
<i>India struggling at 9/4.</i>

1049
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:22,539
<i>The Captain is rushing out.</i>

1050
01:15:22,664 --> 01:15:25,205
<i>It looks like he wasn't prepared
to come out so soon.</i>

1051
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,122
<i>However, it's a moist wicket
and it's windy.</i>

1052
01:15:28,247 --> 01:15:30,923
<i>And there's immense sideways
movement on this green top.</i>

1053
01:15:42,747 --> 01:15:44,419
Brother, what's going on?

1054
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:47,122
Who knows! They're coming,
they're going.

1055
01:15:47,344 --> 01:15:48,627
The ball is swinging.

1056
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:51,788
Play carefully.

1057
01:15:54,017 --> 01:15:55,181
Good morning, Sri.

1058
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:04,896
What's wrong?

1059
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:11,958
<i>Another big wicket for Zimbabwe.</i>

1060
01:16:12,078 --> 01:16:15,927
<i>Yashpal departs for 9. The ball
is moving all over the place.</i>

1061
01:16:16,047 --> 01:16:18,668
<i>India now 17/5.</i>

1062
01:16:18,788 --> 01:16:20,777
Let's go home.

1063
01:16:20,949 --> 01:16:23,743
Amateurs have been sent here
to play cricket. They've messed up.

1064
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:25,330
<i>It's hard to imagine how a side</i>

1065
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:28,983
<i>that finds itself at 17/5
in 13 overs</i>

1066
01:16:29,103 --> 01:16:30,377
<i>can ever recover in a match</i>

1067
01:16:30,497 --> 01:16:34,071
<i>that will determine their chances
of continuing in this World Cup.</i>

1068
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:36,214
Wankhede sir.

1069
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:39,372
17 for 5.

1070
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:44,003
Roger, just stay there.

1071
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,783
Don't give wicket.

1072
01:16:47,664 --> 01:16:49,246
OK, Skipper.

1073
01:16:54,493 --> 01:16:56,315
This is getting over soon.

1074
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:59,004
- Let's keep the taxi waiting.
- Yes.

1075
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:01,747
I'll just be back.
Keep the meter running.

1076
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:03,585
OK.

1077
01:17:03,705 --> 01:17:05,237
<i>Traicos to Binny.</i>

1078
01:17:06,252 --> 01:17:08,224
<i>That's a beautiful straight drive.</i>

1079
01:17:09,885 --> 01:17:11,935
<i>And that should be 4 runs.</i>

1080
01:17:14,164 --> 01:17:18,266
<i>Shot! Beats the fielder.
Four runs.</i>

1081
01:17:20,664 --> 01:17:22,414
<i>That's a beautiful shot
by Roger Binny.</i>

1082
01:17:22,534 --> 01:17:26,621
<i>Looks like India is finally
creeping back into this game.</i>

1083
01:17:32,059 --> 01:17:34,553
<i>Did you speak too soon, Farokh?</i>

1084
01:17:34,673 --> 01:17:38,526
<i>That's the sixth wicket
down for just 77.</i>

1085
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:41,902
<i>Shastri mistimes a slower ball.</i>

1086
01:17:42,816 --> 01:17:45,050
<i>And is caught at mid-off.</i>

1087
01:17:45,278 --> 01:17:47,830
<i>That's the seventh
one gone for just 78.</i>

1088
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:51,164
<i>This is truly a disaster
unfolding here.</i>

1089
01:17:51,414 --> 01:17:55,081
<i>Doesn't look like India
is getting past the 100 mark.</i>

1090
01:17:55,812 --> 01:17:57,628
You're free to go to the hotel.

1091
01:17:58,528 --> 01:18:00,110
See you there.

1092
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,746
We're not going anywhere.
We're staying.

1093
01:18:15,308 --> 01:18:18,914
Madipaa,
just hold on to your wicket.

1094
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:20,919
I'll look after the score.

1095
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:23,499
Don't worry, Kaps.
I'll stay put.

1096
01:18:24,152 --> 01:18:25,622
<i>Contrasting emotions here.</i>

1097
01:18:25,747 --> 01:18:28,228
<i>Zimbabwe fans enjoying
a beautiful afternoon</i>

1098
01:18:28,348 --> 01:18:31,919
<i>while the Indians are miserable
with their team's performance.</i>

1099
01:18:32,216 --> 01:18:34,153
<i>Nice shot by Kapil.</i>

1100
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:38,090
<i>Curran to Kapil.</i>

1101
01:18:38,782 --> 01:18:40,782
<i>Another boundary.</i>

1102
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:46,054
If we make 100 runs we'll save face.

1103
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:05,763
<i>What a hit that is from the Captain!</i>

1104
01:19:05,883 --> 01:19:07,904
He's hit a sixer!

1105
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:10,875
He's hit a sixer!

1106
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:23,042
<i>Looks like that hit has woken up
the Indian players</i>

1107
01:19:23,206 --> 01:19:25,825
<i>from their slumber
in the dressing room.</i>

1108
01:19:25,955 --> 01:19:28,646
<i>There's hope while
he's still out there.</i>

1109
01:19:36,265 --> 01:19:39,262
<i>And Madan Lal sweeps that for four.</i>

1110
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:45,044
<i>Curran to Kapil
and another boundary.</i>

1111
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:47,113
Turn around.

1112
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,417
Turn around.

1113
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:52,205
<i>Kapil hitting the ball all around
the park now.</i>

1114
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:56,372
<i>At lunch Kapil and Madan Lal have
given some semblance of an innings.</i>

1115
01:19:56,664 --> 01:19:59,247
<i>36 overs down, Kapil is at 50.</i>

1116
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:04,567
<i>But India are at 124/7 and
still in serious trouble.</i>

1117
01:20:08,289 --> 01:20:11,768
If we make a 150-runs.
We'll go with respect.

1118
01:20:14,068 --> 01:20:15,830
We're not going anywhere, Ballu.

1119
01:20:16,747 --> 01:20:20,330
What happen, happen!
We still have 24 overs.

1120
01:20:21,872 --> 01:20:23,978
We fight till end.

1121
01:20:32,122 --> 01:20:34,914
Bring the sword out, Yash.

1122
01:20:37,003 --> 01:20:38,539
The sword?

1123
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:40,998
Mongoose bat!

1124
01:20:57,984 --> 01:20:59,497
Couple of early wickets.

1125
01:20:59,977 --> 01:21:01,393
He's got the mongoose.

1126
01:21:02,716 --> 01:21:04,605
<i>Kapil brings out the mongoose bat.</i>

1127
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:08,580
<i>Better batting conditions post lunch,
encouraging him to counter-attack.</i>

1128
01:21:09,068 --> 01:21:11,267
<i>He puts that bat to good use.</i>

1129
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:14,865
<i>Curran bowls again. Kapil hits a
second boundary of the over</i>

1130
01:21:14,985 --> 01:21:16,992
<i>and Curran looking
a little frustrated.</i>

1131
01:21:21,205 --> 01:21:23,722
<i>Kapil unleashing a furious assault
on the bowlers.</i>

1132
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:26,445
Good, Kapsi. Come on, Kapsi!

1133
01:21:29,925 --> 01:21:32,075
<i>And Madan Lal's caught behind.</i>

1134
01:21:32,195 --> 01:21:36,164
<i>A 62 run partnership that
stabilized India comes to an end.</i>

1135
01:21:36,289 --> 01:21:40,992
<i>The Indian score still
precariously placed at 140/8.</i>

1136
01:21:52,577 --> 01:21:54,496
Who moved?

1137
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:58,483
- To pee.
- Don't move.

1138
01:22:02,076 --> 01:22:05,372
We'll get them before we're down.

1139
01:22:06,957 --> 01:22:09,015
They can't get rid of us.

1140
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:12,467
Listen, everyone.

1141
01:22:13,289 --> 01:22:15,247
Till Kapil is batting,

1142
01:22:15,759 --> 01:22:17,472
no one moves.

1143
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:21,610
- Pee...
- Statue-like.

1144
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:25,015
You hit. I'm right here.

1145
01:22:29,048 --> 01:22:32,604
Try getting me out.
Just try it.

1146
01:22:34,914 --> 01:22:37,293
- Romi.
- No one move.

1147
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:49,231
<i>Kirmani off to a strong start.
That's a boundary.</i>

1148
01:22:51,622 --> 01:22:53,332
I'm right here too, Kapsi.

1149
01:22:56,374 --> 01:22:58,533
<i>And the onslaught continues.</i>

1150
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:12,128
<i>That's mistimed and it's a six.</i>

1151
01:23:12,697 --> 01:23:14,414
You're just a bloody slogger!

1152
01:23:14,539 --> 01:23:17,345
<i>Seems to be an exchange of words
between Kapil and Kevin.</i>

1153
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:23,222
<i>That's another big one.
It's a straight hit over the wicket.</i>

1154
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:25,650
Oh, bloody hell!

1155
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:30,497
And that was a straight six.
Right into the commentator's box.

1156
01:23:30,622 --> 01:23:33,161
India now 164 for 8.

1157
01:23:35,255 --> 01:23:37,377
<i>The Indian fans delighted
by Kapil's century.</i>

1158
01:23:37,497 --> 01:23:40,210
<i>Who would have believed, under
the circumstances?</i>

1159
01:23:40,441 --> 01:23:43,485
<i>A first for an Indian
in a limited overs match.</i>

1160
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:48,789
If we make 175 runs.
We'll manage it.

1161
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:50,473
What did you say?

1162
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,830
First it was 100 then 150
and now 175?

1163
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:54,865
Is there no end to your demands?

1164
01:23:54,985 --> 01:23:57,830
Fix a target score and get them
to play accordingly.

1165
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,567
- He's shooting off his mouth.
- OK, 200.

1166
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,971
Bloody hell! That's my car.

1167
01:24:45,542 --> 01:24:48,947
<i>Kapil has crossed 150.
An unbelievable knock.</i>

1168
01:24:49,971 --> 01:24:52,164
<i>I think the spectators
need helmets now.</i>

1169
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:54,980
No one move. I'll be back
in a minute.

1170
01:24:55,284 --> 01:24:57,164
I can't control it anymore.

1171
01:24:57,346 --> 01:24:59,609
It's your responsibility
if it goes wrong.

1172
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:01,366
- Why?
- Agree?

1173
01:25:01,795 --> 01:25:03,366
- No.
- So, wait.

1174
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:08,102
- Are you going to wet your pants?
- Just about. Get lost!

1175
01:25:11,008 --> 01:25:13,775
Gentlemen, what's the world record?

1176
01:25:23,497 --> 01:25:26,443
Good shot, Kapil! Good shot!

1177
01:25:26,927 --> 01:25:28,969
171 by Glenn Turner.

1178
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:36,497
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we're about
to see a world record being broken.</i>

1179
01:26:09,395 --> 01:26:11,955
You've been hitting sixers.

1180
01:26:12,405 --> 01:26:15,000
How come they're clapping
for a single?

1181
01:26:15,657 --> 01:26:17,119
Who knows!

1182
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,454
Ask the Umpire.

1183
01:26:21,447 --> 01:26:22,497
What happen?

1184
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:23,928
What happened?

1185
01:26:24,008 --> 01:26:26,361
You just broke the
bloody World Record!

1186
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,497
Congratulations!

1187
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,362
- Come on, Kapil!
- Congratulations!

1188
01:27:13,289 --> 01:27:15,539
You're a true freedom fighter.

1189
01:27:24,026 --> 01:27:27,872
<i>He walked in when India were just
9 runs for 4 wickets.</i>

1190
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:32,622
<i>He faced 138 balls, 16 boundaries
and 6 sixes.</i>

1191
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,794
He took India to 266 for 8,

1192
01:27:35,914 --> 01:27:40,996
<i>and he himself finished with
an historic 175, not out.</i>

1193
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:48,372
<i>Today we saw undoubtedly</i>

1194
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:53,122
<i>one of the greatest knocks in the
history of this beautiful game.</i>

1195
01:28:12,707 --> 01:28:16,119
<i>Pain keeps telling your strong arms</i>

1196
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:19,587
<i>If you stop now, you're in trouble</i>

1197
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:24,357
<i>Pain keeps telling you</i>

1198
01:28:24,477 --> 01:28:27,781
<i>You can will defeat away</i>

1199
01:28:27,901 --> 01:28:31,479
<i>You're no ordinary man</i>

1200
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:35,618
<i>You could never pass by unnoticed</i>

1201
01:28:35,738 --> 01:28:39,519
<i>There is no one like you</i>

1202
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:43,610
<i>This field is all yours,
power is in your hands</i>

1203
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,615
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1204
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:47,760
<i>Don't bow down now</i>

1205
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,645
<i>Don't let tiredness overcome you</i>

1206
01:28:49,765 --> 01:28:51,616
<i>Never give up, never give up</i>

1207
01:28:51,736 --> 01:28:53,485
<i>Don't cower down</i>

1208
01:28:53,605 --> 01:28:55,439
<i>Don't hide your strength</i>

1209
01:28:55,559 --> 01:28:57,411
<i>Don't let it falter</i>

1210
01:28:57,531 --> 01:29:00,359
<i>Never give up, never give up</i>

1211
01:29:03,935 --> 01:29:07,372
<i>What a shame the BBC
was on strike today.</i>

1212
01:29:07,497 --> 01:29:10,534
<i>The innings Kapil Dev played
today would have been a lesson</i>

1213
01:29:10,654 --> 01:29:12,387
<i>for generations to come.</i>

1214
01:29:12,507 --> 01:29:18,835
<i>Some events wipe out all
differences and unite hearts.</i>

1215
01:29:18,955 --> 01:29:22,591
<i>Today we witnessed such an
event at Tunbridge Wells.</i>

1216
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:26,267
<i>Your country of origin did
not matter nor your age.</i>

1217
01:29:26,497 --> 01:29:33,047
<i>Because everyone who was there
witnessed history in the making.</i>

1218
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:39,189
<i>Today a player brought victory
to his team single-handedly</i>

1219
01:29:39,414 --> 01:29:47,390
and made many millions of Indians
proudly hold their heads up high.

1220
01:29:49,747 --> 01:29:51,330
£300.

1221
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:53,789
- Yes, governor.
- It was worth it!

1222
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,157
Kuku has broken a World Record!

1223
01:29:56,277 --> 01:29:59,720
That's why I say you should
drink milk. Yes!

1224
01:29:59,914 --> 01:30:02,159
You keep asking why, mister.

1225
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,231
I didn't know we would play so well.

1226
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:10,152
We can make it to the semis now.
Must they start playing badly?

1227
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:13,828
If India loses face,
so will you, right?

1228
01:30:13,948 --> 01:30:16,112
Stop talking!

1229
01:30:16,707 --> 01:30:18,955
Tell me how much extra
for the flight?

1230
01:30:19,406 --> 01:30:21,747
How am I going to find
that much money?

1231
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:30,514
You should know which way
your ball will swing.

1232
01:30:38,831 --> 01:30:41,811
Bravo, Ballu! You hid your
inswinger this time.

1233
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:43,933
Come on. One more.

1234
01:30:53,353 --> 01:30:54,686
What was that? In or out?

1235
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:04,041
I fought to have you and Ballu
on our team,

1236
01:31:05,478 --> 01:31:08,894
not for you to let the wind
and the pitch do it all.

1237
01:31:14,353 --> 01:31:16,517
When you your potential realise?

1238
01:31:20,398 --> 01:31:21,936
Say it softly.

1239
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:24,519
He'll feel bad.
He's playing well.

1240
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:26,811
He could play just as well
in his sleep, Maan.

1241
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:29,251
We must make it to the semis.

1242
01:31:30,497 --> 01:31:32,478
Just playing so-so won't do.

1243
01:31:33,995 --> 01:31:38,144
You must outdo yourselves
in every match.

1244
01:31:38,978 --> 01:31:40,519
All of us must.

1245
01:31:44,843 --> 01:31:46,103
Come on.

1246
01:31:53,519 --> 01:31:55,710
- Aren't you ready?
- No.

1247
01:31:57,269 --> 01:31:59,728
- Kapil is just...
- I said: "No, Ballu."

1248
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:04,059
- It's the High Commissioner's party.
- Not interested.

1249
01:32:06,686 --> 01:32:09,447
Why, Brit? Are you scared we'll
force you to sing the National Anthem?

1250
01:32:09,478 --> 01:32:12,103
Don't worry. I'll teach you
the words.

1251
01:32:13,269 --> 01:32:15,297
Just knowing the National Anthem
doesn't mean a thing

1252
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:18,067
if it doesn't swell your
bloody chest every time it's sung!

1253
01:32:25,807 --> 01:32:29,633
No one should make fun of Roger
about the National Anthem.

1254
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:31,833
- What's wrong?
- He's sulking.

1255
01:32:31,953 --> 01:32:36,267
- What did he say?
- Many things.

1256
01:32:37,076 --> 01:32:40,103
- Something about the National Anthem.
- But what did he say?

1257
01:32:40,294 --> 01:32:45,754
He said: "Bloody chest swelling."

1258
01:32:45,874 --> 01:32:50,868
I can't repeat his words with
as much feeling.

1259
01:32:51,671 --> 01:32:53,248
He moved me.

1260
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,041
Congratulations.
What an achievement! Really!

1261
01:32:57,161 --> 01:32:58,506
Thank you so much.

1262
01:32:58,737 --> 01:33:02,181
Kapil, Romi, Man Singh,
meet David Frith.

1263
01:33:02,726 --> 01:33:04,370
A very senior journalist.

1264
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:07,019
Congratulations, Kapil,
on the World Record.

1265
01:33:07,144 --> 01:33:08,478
It's a pity I couldn't watch it.

1266
01:33:08,598 --> 01:33:10,742
You should've. It was glorious.

1267
01:33:10,862 --> 01:33:11,720
Ah, yes.

1268
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,644
But you see that day was also
the clash of the giants at Lord's.

1269
01:33:15,764 --> 01:33:17,579
West Indies vs Australia.

1270
01:33:17,987 --> 01:33:20,227
Now you wouldn't miss that
match for anything. Would you?

1271
01:33:22,062 --> 01:33:23,436
I would!

1272
01:33:23,773 --> 01:33:26,587
It's not every day you get to see
a World Record now, do you?

1273
01:33:28,285 --> 01:33:29,958
No, not at all.

1274
01:33:30,222 --> 01:33:32,061
I'm sure you're proud of him.

1275
01:33:32,181 --> 01:33:34,269
You've done a rather
splendid job, Kapil.

1276
01:33:34,837 --> 01:33:37,688
I'm sure you'll go back
a happy man now.

1277
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:42,770
Hello, Mr. Frith.

1278
01:33:44,957 --> 01:33:47,478
We've read your article.

1279
01:33:47,718 --> 01:33:49,061
No, Kapil?

1280
01:33:49,894 --> 01:33:51,388
Myself Srikkanth.

1281
01:33:51,737 --> 01:33:54,671
And my beautiful wife, Vidhya.
Come here.

1282
01:33:55,635 --> 01:33:58,441
She's shy. We got married just before
the World Cup.

1283
01:33:58,561 --> 01:34:00,063
Congratulations, my dear.

1284
01:34:00,472 --> 01:34:04,220
You know, just after our marriage,
a phone call came.

1285
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:07,624
We've been selected for
the 1983 World Cup they said.

1286
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:09,345
I thought: "Very good."

1287
01:34:09,465 --> 01:34:12,174
So, we booked our tickets.
Bombay to New York.

1288
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:13,994
A stopover in London.

1289
01:34:14,254 --> 01:34:15,850
With me in this plan...

1290
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:17,204
Sandy was there.

1291
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:19,269
Roger. Where is Roger?

1292
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:23,992
Kirti, Kirmani, Shastri.

1293
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:27,061
We were all going for
a holiday to the US.

1294
01:34:27,394 --> 01:34:30,672
We thought we'd play the World Cup
matches on the way.

1295
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:33,788
Then we'd go on our honeymoon.
That was the plan.

1296
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:36,817
Why are you embarrassed?

1297
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:38,598
You were all there
in the plan, no?

1298
01:34:38,902 --> 01:34:41,902
Maan Bhai, you were
also there in the plan.

1299
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,017
You must understand one thing.

1300
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:47,022
We have never won any match
in any World Cup.

1301
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:50,804
Before 1983, we beat only
one team - East Africa.

1302
01:34:50,924 --> 01:34:53,061
First of all, there is no country
called East Africa.

1303
01:34:53,186 --> 01:34:54,772
You all know that.

1304
01:34:54,892 --> 01:34:57,379
It's basically a bunch
of Gujaratis put together,

1305
01:34:57,499 --> 01:34:59,073
the Patels and their brothers.

1306
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,619
They just formed a team.

1307
01:35:01,739 --> 01:35:03,407
And that's the only team we beat.

1308
01:35:03,584 --> 01:35:05,427
So now, in 1983, we come here

1309
01:35:05,547 --> 01:35:08,811
and our Captain says we'll beat
the West Indies.

1310
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:12,539
We thought our Captain
had lost his mind.

1311
01:35:12,659 --> 01:35:14,267
Who is in the team?

1312
01:35:14,387 --> 01:35:16,248
Opening - Gordon Greenidge,
Desmond Haynes.

1313
01:35:16,368 --> 01:35:18,684
Number 3. Viv Richards,
Clive Lloyd.

1314
01:35:18,877 --> 01:35:20,311
And the 4 fast bowlers,

1315
01:35:20,436 --> 01:35:23,681
whose names none of us want
to remember for the rest of our lives.

1316
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:27,480
And Dilip! He definitely
doesn't want to remember.

1317
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:30,997
And our mad Captain

1318
01:35:31,246 --> 01:35:33,439
says we'll win this match.

1319
01:35:33,559 --> 01:35:37,423
I tell you the Captain has gone mad!

1320
01:35:49,213 --> 01:35:50,680
But Mr Frith,

1321
01:35:52,269 --> 01:35:53,478
he was serious.

1322
01:35:56,655 --> 01:36:00,280
And that day we defeated your
"giant" West Indies.

1323
01:36:03,844 --> 01:36:07,144
I don't think our mad Captain
is going to go back happy with just...

1324
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:10,058
"a rather splendid job."
That he's done till now.

1325
01:36:14,398 --> 01:36:19,976
He'll be only happy when he's holding
the World Cup in his hands.

1326
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:31,462
Nothing less will do!
Nothing less.

1327
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:56,093
Like people say:

1328
01:36:58,909 --> 01:37:01,061
"Taste success once...

1329
01:37:01,539 --> 01:37:04,369
"tongue wants more!"

1330
01:37:05,321 --> 01:37:08,144
Kapsi! To our mad Captain.

1331
01:37:08,269 --> 01:37:09,947
- To the World Cup!
- To the World Cup!

1332
01:37:10,067 --> 01:37:12,632
- To the World Cup!
- To the World Cup!

1333
01:37:15,758 --> 01:37:17,769
<i>Racing to the front
leaving everyone behind</i>

1334
01:37:17,894 --> 01:37:19,451
<i>With our heads held high</i>

1335
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:23,269
<i>We enter the field,
proud in our uniforms</i>

1336
01:37:23,394 --> 01:37:27,123
<i>Now that we are here,
we shall prove our talent</i>

1337
01:37:27,303 --> 01:37:30,190
<i>We shall show our strength</i>

1338
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:34,754
<i>The strength of passion.
The fire of determination</i>

1339
01:37:34,957 --> 01:37:38,506
<i>The world will learn from us</i>

1340
01:37:41,436 --> 01:37:45,108
<i>We will win, we will win</i>

1341
01:37:45,228 --> 01:37:48,684
<i>India will win</i>

1342
01:37:48,871 --> 01:37:52,621
<i>A prayer in every heart</i>

1343
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:56,745
<i>The belief of millions</i>

1344
01:37:56,979 --> 01:38:00,232
<i>We shall win, win we shall</i>

1345
01:38:00,433 --> 01:38:04,023
<i>India shall win</i>

1346
01:38:04,203 --> 01:38:08,016
<i>Fulfilling all our promises</i>

1347
01:38:26,726 --> 01:38:29,768
<i>India wins by a huge margin
of 118 runs.</i>

1348
01:38:29,888 --> 01:38:34,130
<i>Roger Binny has broken the back of the
Australians by taking 4 crucial wickets.</i>

1349
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,080
For my team.

1350
01:38:36,123 --> 01:38:40,041
<i>India go to the semi-finals and
Roger Binny is the Man of the Match.</i>

1351
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:41,980
For my Captain.

1352
01:38:43,918 --> 01:38:45,479
Thank you.

1353
01:38:58,448 --> 01:39:00,667
Twenty wounded.

1354
01:39:02,001 --> 01:39:04,913
Four killed in Nawabpur.

1355
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,875
Communal violence continues.

1356
01:39:09,113 --> 01:39:11,103
How will it end?

1357
01:39:11,382 --> 01:39:12,894
Madam!

1358
01:39:13,355 --> 01:39:16,644
We've reached the semi-finals
in the World Cup!

1359
01:39:16,893 --> 01:39:21,061
There's communal rioting in India
and you're talking about cricket?

1360
01:39:21,181 --> 01:39:25,353
Sports are above religious
differences.

1361
01:39:26,277 --> 01:39:29,103
Madam, what has cricket
to do with all this?

1362
01:39:29,731 --> 01:39:32,978
Did you know India
is in the semi-finals?

1363
01:39:33,098 --> 01:39:33,921
Yes, Madam.

1364
01:39:34,098 --> 01:39:37,292
- Does everyone know?
- Yes, Madam.

1365
01:39:37,412 --> 01:39:40,185
- Everyone knows. They're very happy.
- Why?

1366
01:39:40,305 --> 01:39:42,811
Madam, no one believed
it could happen.

1367
01:39:43,038 --> 01:39:45,769
Everyone hoped it would.

1368
01:39:45,949 --> 01:39:48,384
It's a different story
in the big cities,

1369
01:39:48,504 --> 01:39:50,686
- but in small towns like Nawabpur?
- Why not?

1370
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:54,015
Don't they understand cricket?

1371
01:39:57,593 --> 01:40:00,630
Make this World Cup into a festival.

1372
01:40:01,135 --> 01:40:04,407
Get all India watching it on TV.

1373
01:40:05,217 --> 01:40:08,337
The World Cup games
must obsess all of India.

1374
01:40:08,952 --> 01:40:11,700
Will India win the semi-final?

1375
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,965
Will India win the World Cup?

1376
01:40:15,085 --> 01:40:22,478
Make sure every home in Nawabpur
can watch the matches live.

1377
01:40:23,241 --> 01:40:26,811
<i>Eight different countries have been
playing in the World Cup.</i>

1378
01:40:27,114 --> 01:40:32,019
<i>The Indian cricket team has made
history by making it to the semi-finals.</i>

1379
01:40:32,139 --> 01:40:37,451
<i>The match will take place
at Old Trafford in Manchester.</i>

1380
01:40:37,571 --> 01:40:40,598
<i>The semi-finals will be played between
India and England.</i>

1381
01:40:40,718 --> 01:40:44,019
<i>You can watch the match
on Doordarshan across the country.</i>

1382
01:40:44,139 --> 01:40:46,837
Grandpa, did you hear?

1383
01:40:47,024 --> 01:40:50,311
The monkeys have broken the antenna.
We'll miss the match.

1384
01:40:50,431 --> 01:40:53,000
- We'll get it repaired tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1385
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:54,872
There's rioting in the town,

1386
01:40:54,992 --> 01:40:57,811
and you want to watch a match?
No one goes out.

1387
01:40:57,931 --> 01:41:00,228
- Your grandfather?
- Yes, sir.

1388
01:41:00,353 --> 01:41:02,061
How did it happen?

1389
01:41:02,272 --> 01:41:05,978
Heart attack. Massive.
Morning walking and dead!

1390
01:41:06,144 --> 01:41:07,509
That's terrible.

1391
01:41:07,935 --> 01:41:09,319
Tomorrow is funeral.

1392
01:41:12,077 --> 01:41:14,186
- In Manchester.
- Manchester?

1393
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,110
Yes, sir.

1394
01:41:16,387 --> 01:41:18,823
All right. Go on then.

1395
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:29,400
You're a troublemaker.

1396
01:41:40,016 --> 01:41:41,776
Namaste, sister-in-law.

1397
01:41:41,896 --> 01:41:44,353
I was telling you about Julie...

1398
01:41:51,103 --> 01:41:53,949
Simran has broken off
the engagement.

1399
01:41:54,455 --> 01:41:56,212
What?

1400
01:41:57,741 --> 01:41:59,478
Her brother called.

1401
01:42:00,228 --> 01:42:02,951
He said my house is too small,

1402
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:08,937
and I couldn't afford to keep
Simran happy on my salary.

1403
01:42:13,166 --> 01:42:15,175
He's right.

1404
01:42:16,103 --> 01:42:18,103
We don't earn half as much as
doctors or engineers.

1405
01:42:19,454 --> 01:42:23,086
Why would anyone want
their daughter to marry a cricketer?

1406
01:42:50,532 --> 01:42:51,935
Hey, Kapil...

1407
01:42:53,565 --> 01:42:54,853
Have you read this?

1408
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:56,370
They say it's a fluke.

1409
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:58,936
I don't know what the word means.

1410
01:42:59,186 --> 01:43:02,021
'Fluke' means it's pure luck
that we won.

1411
01:43:03,025 --> 01:43:05,004
Kapil, you must say
something about this.

1412
01:43:05,124 --> 01:43:06,761
How?

1413
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:10,103
When I speak English at the
team meetings, you laugh.

1414
01:43:10,228 --> 01:43:11,728
You keep catching me out.

1415
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:14,434
So, if I said anything to them,
it'd bounce off their heads.

1416
01:43:15,161 --> 01:43:18,103
No, Kapsi, it's not funny.
We won our way here.

1417
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:22,436
We didn't get to the semi-finals
because of a quota.

1418
01:43:22,905 --> 01:43:26,144
What this article deserves

1419
01:43:26,478 --> 01:43:27,984
is what I'm doing.

1420
01:43:29,728 --> 01:43:32,223
You must make a statement, Captain.

1421
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:33,990
Let's play cricket instead.

1422
01:43:34,228 --> 01:43:37,367
I feel like smashing their faces in.
Aren't you furious?

1423
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:39,072
Madipaa.

1424
01:43:43,644 --> 01:43:45,541
Why are the West Indies
champions today?

1425
01:43:47,706 --> 01:43:52,443
In 1975 when Tony Greg
was England's Captain,

1426
01:43:52,563 --> 01:43:54,978
remember what he said about
the West Indies?

1427
01:43:57,144 --> 01:43:59,394
"We'll rub their faces in the mud.

1428
01:44:01,052 --> 01:44:02,811
"Make them grovel."

1429
01:44:04,353 --> 01:44:07,186
The West Indies didn't react.

1430
01:44:08,311 --> 01:44:10,811
They just went ahead and won
the World Cup twice.

1431
01:44:16,644 --> 01:44:19,103
The way we'll play will be
our answer.

1432
01:44:27,419 --> 01:44:29,228
"Where we come from."

1433
01:44:29,353 --> 01:44:30,584
"We are the England."

1434
01:44:30,704 --> 01:44:34,104
<i>You know what happened the last time the an
Englishman said: "We'll make them grovel."</i>

1435
01:44:34,131 --> 01:44:36,895
<i>You created the West Indies
killing machine.</i>

1436
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:40,061
<i>Well, I'll take my chances and
say the same again.</i>

1437
01:44:40,186 --> 01:44:42,082
<i>With people half the height,</i>

1438
01:44:42,202 --> 01:44:44,952
<i>a third of the pace
and a quarter of the ability.</i>

1439
01:44:45,154 --> 01:44:48,816
<i>And remember the history,
in limited overs cricket,</i>

1440
01:44:48,936 --> 01:44:52,608
<i>India has never beaten England
in England.</i>

1441
01:44:52,728 --> 01:44:56,405
<i>Maybe this time India
wants to rewrite history.</i>

1442
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:06,806
"Where we come from."

1443
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:08,936
"We are the England."

1444
01:45:09,132 --> 01:45:11,805
<i>Sandhu being punished
by the English batsman.</i>

1445
01:45:11,925 --> 01:45:15,483
<i>50 up. A promising start indeed
for England.</i>

1446
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:19,869
- Give Ballu a rest.
- What's wrong?

1447
01:45:19,989 --> 01:45:21,726
His engagement was
called off last night.

1448
01:45:21,846 --> 01:45:23,061
What?

1449
01:45:41,959 --> 01:45:43,436
Come! Come.

1450
01:45:46,678 --> 01:45:51,311
<i>Binny to Tavaré. Azad tries to
stop it, but it's a boundary.</i>

1451
01:45:52,452 --> 01:45:53,728
Has it come?

1452
01:45:54,299 --> 01:45:55,954
No.

1453
01:45:57,172 --> 01:46:00,017
<i>Madan Lal gets hit
for a beautiful cover drive.</i>

1454
01:46:03,793 --> 01:46:05,769
- Has it come?
- No.

1455
01:46:18,780 --> 01:46:21,061
<i>And that brings up the 100
for England</i>

1456
01:46:21,244 --> 01:46:24,779
<i>in the 25th over for the loss
of just two wickets.</i>

1457
01:46:25,845 --> 01:46:29,811
<i>The Indians really need to try and
contain the English batsman now.</i>

1458
01:46:32,151 --> 01:46:33,394
And now?

1459
01:46:33,983 --> 01:46:35,311
<i>There's a change of bowler.</i>

1460
01:46:35,436 --> 01:46:36,186
The signal is back.

1461
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,579
<i>Will Jimmy stop the English batsman?</i>

1462
01:46:42,634 --> 01:46:44,317
<i>Out!</i>

1463
01:46:45,513 --> 01:46:48,186
<i>Jimmy has played just the way
the Captain had hoped.</i>

1464
01:46:48,311 --> 01:46:52,639
<i>The wicket that India desperately needed.
Spectacular bowling!</i>

1465
01:46:52,934 --> 01:46:54,978
<i>Kirti Azad brought into the attack.</i>

1466
01:46:55,881 --> 01:46:57,880
<i>A sweep shot by Lamb.</i>

1467
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:00,668
<i>That's a direct hit!</i>

1468
01:47:01,187 --> 01:47:04,569
<i>Very, very quick thinking and a fine
piece of cricket by Yashpal Sharma.</i>

1469
01:47:04,689 --> 01:47:07,103
<i>A very important wicket for India to get.</i>

1470
01:47:08,389 --> 01:47:11,175
<i>Jimmy to Gatting, and that's clean bowled.</i>

1471
01:47:11,362 --> 01:47:13,493
<i>A second wicket for Jimmy Amarnath.</i>

1472
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,228
<i>Oh! That's got him.</i>

1473
01:47:17,353 --> 01:47:20,868
<i>That ball was kept really low
and Botham is gone for 6.</i>

1474
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:25,567
<i>The ball hit the stump less than a foot
high. Poor Botham was left high and dry.</i>

1475
01:47:25,687 --> 01:47:29,769
<i>England in real trouble now.
160 for 6.</i>

1476
01:47:29,889 --> 01:47:32,680
<i>The jubilant Indian crowd has
invaded the pitch.</i>

1477
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,061
<i>The situation for England
has become critical.</i>

1478
01:47:35,181 --> 01:47:38,811
<i>Amarnath and Azad are choking off
England's supply of runs.</i>

1479
01:47:38,936 --> 01:47:41,607
Mind the pitch!

1480
01:47:41,727 --> 01:47:43,438
Jimmy, they're spoiling the pitch.

1481
01:47:43,558 --> 01:47:48,394
Kirti, the ball spins or is low.
How did you manage both?

1482
01:47:48,769 --> 01:47:51,769
Kaps, at release time

1483
01:47:51,998 --> 01:47:54,614
I held the ball like this
and I...

1484
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:01,462
Kaps, sorry.
It's a trade secret.

1485
01:48:01,731 --> 01:48:03,271
I learnt it for the World Cup.

1486
01:48:06,415 --> 01:48:07,811
Well bowled, Kirti!

1487
01:48:08,115 --> 01:48:11,027
Kirti, tell me how you did it.

1488
01:48:12,393 --> 01:48:16,249
I couldn't admit to Kaps
that I didn't have a clue!

1489
01:48:16,369 --> 01:48:18,397
- What?
- What is it?

1490
01:48:18,624 --> 01:48:22,061
Bowled Botham out. I earned £50.
What more could I want!

1491
01:48:23,627 --> 01:48:25,853
<i>Kapil Dev back into the attack.</i>

1492
01:48:26,157 --> 01:48:28,039
<i>And he's clean bowled.</i>

1493
01:48:32,501 --> 01:48:33,978
<i>Kapil to Allott.</i>

1494
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:38,063
<i>He mistimes that and Patil
catches it at short third man.</i>

1495
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,353
<i>Willis's leg stump goes over.</i>

1496
01:48:41,478 --> 01:48:45,769
<i>He goes for nought, and England
are dismissed for a score of 213.</i>

1497
01:48:45,889 --> 01:48:49,610
<i>Kapil gets his 3rd wicket
from the last ball of the 60th over.</i>

1498
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:53,478
<i>Great recovery from India after a
solid start from the English batsmen.</i>

1499
01:48:53,598 --> 01:48:56,711
<i>The wicket was conducive
to Indian bowlers.</i>

1500
01:48:56,939 --> 01:48:59,105
<i>Round one had a similar wicket</i>

1501
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:01,983
<i>that helped Kapil's team
defeat the West Indies.</i>

1502
01:49:09,838 --> 01:49:12,270
What's the score?

1503
01:49:13,287 --> 01:49:15,549
England 213. All out.

1504
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:16,979
England all out!

1505
01:49:18,105 --> 01:49:23,064
Patla, you go four down today.
I'll go after you.

1506
01:49:23,415 --> 01:49:24,806
What's wrong?

1507
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:26,704
STD.

1508
01:49:27,505 --> 01:49:29,503
- What?
- I've got STD.

1509
01:49:30,532 --> 01:49:32,505
I warned you guys.

1510
01:49:32,796 --> 01:49:34,774
- Don't do it with everyone.
- Pass the soda.

1511
01:49:34,981 --> 01:49:36,562
Soda?

1512
01:49:36,771 --> 01:49:38,755
That doesn't cure STD.

1513
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,510
It'll help me burp.

1514
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:43,027
How can that fix STD?

1515
01:49:43,147 --> 01:49:44,650
It works for me.

1516
01:49:44,838 --> 01:49:47,505
Patla, "acidity!"

1517
01:49:48,796 --> 01:49:50,796
Give him a soda, he'll be okay.

1518
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:52,380
That's what I told you.

1519
01:49:54,002 --> 01:49:55,383
What did you think?

1520
01:49:55,674 --> 01:49:56,892
I thought you had an STD.

1521
01:49:57,073 --> 01:49:59,171
That's what I said.
'Acidity.'

1522
01:50:00,463 --> 01:50:01,838
Hey, Dhadpadango!

1523
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:05,130
Mind where you're going.
Fancy yourself an ace batsman.

1524
01:50:05,338 --> 01:50:07,838
- Calm down! Have a soda.
- All he does is smoke and hit.

1525
01:50:11,255 --> 01:50:13,360
<i>Willis to Gavaskar.</i>

1526
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:16,614
<i>Flicks it off his pads
for a boundary.</i>

1527
01:50:24,546 --> 01:50:28,296
<i>Srikkanth uses the pace of the bowler
to beat a third man for a boundary.</i>

1528
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:31,583
<i>Four handsome runs by Sunil Gavaskar.</i>

1529
01:50:33,032 --> 01:50:35,727
<i>Belligerent blow by this
smashing stroke maker.</i>

1530
01:50:42,305 --> 01:50:44,008
<i>The Little Master is in form.</i>

1531
01:50:54,926 --> 01:50:59,310
<i>It's a solid start to the Indian
innings by Gavaskar and Srikkanth.</i>

1532
01:50:59,430 --> 01:51:01,503
<i>46 for no loss.</i>

1533
01:51:08,521 --> 01:51:10,720
<i>That's the wicket
England wanted badly.</i>

1534
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:15,363
<i>No opposing team is comfortable as long
as Gavaskar is still at the crease.</i>

1535
01:51:17,171 --> 01:51:19,067
<i>Pulled away for a four.</i>

1536
01:51:19,509 --> 01:51:23,380
<i>Srikkanth on 19,
building his innings well.</i>

1537
01:51:26,377 --> 01:51:28,230
Catch it!

1538
01:51:35,719 --> 01:51:37,765
<i>Srikkanth is out.</i>

1539
01:51:37,935 --> 01:51:41,490
<i>Both openers gone in consecutive overs.</i>

1540
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:43,323
Cheeka is always so careless.

1541
01:51:43,443 --> 01:51:46,294
<i>India at 50/2.</i>

1542
01:51:58,865 --> 01:52:00,758
<i>Marks now, coming in from
a different end.</i>

1543
01:52:00,878 --> 01:52:03,526
<i>Hit firmly to mid-on.
Going for a single.</i>

1544
01:52:07,672 --> 01:52:10,296
<i>Out comes the stump.
Did Sharma make it?</i>

1545
01:52:10,505 --> 01:52:14,363
<i>The Umpire, David Evans, is in a
perfect position to make that call.</i>

1546
01:52:18,505 --> 01:52:20,352
<i>Not out says the Umpire.</i>

1547
01:52:22,828 --> 01:52:24,796
Sorry, STD.

1548
01:52:25,151 --> 01:52:27,820
Yash, we have a lot of overs left.
Don't take any risks.

1549
01:52:28,005 --> 01:52:29,319
OK.

1550
01:52:30,046 --> 01:52:31,921
I'll hit. Save your wicket.

1551
01:52:32,112 --> 01:52:34,367
- OK, Jimpa.
- Bravo! Be strong.

1552
01:52:35,969 --> 01:52:37,796
<i>Amarnath comes down the pitch.</i>

1553
01:52:38,443 --> 01:52:39,664
<i>It's a six.</i>

1554
01:52:39,784 --> 01:52:41,733
<i>That's 100 for India.</i>

1555
01:52:41,853 --> 01:52:43,444
That's more like it.

1556
01:52:51,266 --> 01:52:52,792
Good shot, Yash.

1557
01:52:53,184 --> 01:52:56,013
Careful. We both can't risk it.

1558
01:52:56,133 --> 01:52:57,779
OK, Jimpa.
No problem.

1559
01:52:59,213 --> 01:53:01,921
<i>He's play that on side.
The fielder giving it chase.</i>

1560
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:04,045
<i>Unsuccessfully.</i>

1561
01:53:07,107 --> 01:53:08,918
<i>Willis comes in for his second spell.</i>

1562
01:53:09,038 --> 01:53:10,689
Yash.

1563
01:53:15,837 --> 01:53:17,296
<i>That's a magnificent shot.</i>

1564
01:53:17,421 --> 01:53:18,731
<i>Yashpal has made room for himself</i>

1565
01:53:18,755 --> 01:53:21,781
<i>and put it on its way for a
magnificent game changing six.</i>

1566
01:53:21,901 --> 01:53:23,505
Great shot! But why take risks?

1567
01:53:23,625 --> 01:53:25,801
Jimpa, you don't know.

1568
01:53:25,921 --> 01:53:28,411
He insulted me in the Madras match.

1569
01:53:28,816 --> 01:53:29,921
I won't spare him.

1570
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:32,108
You'll take your Madras revenge
in Manchester?

1571
01:53:32,525 --> 01:53:35,791
Brother, it's the semi-finals.
Stay calm.

1572
01:53:36,494 --> 01:53:38,213
OK, big brother.

1573
01:53:38,676 --> 01:53:40,829
You say OK, OK. But you do
as you please.

1574
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:43,559
Easy.

1575
01:53:47,237 --> 01:53:49,880
<i>Yashpal has flicked it towards
deep square leg.</i>

1576
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,327
<i>He takes a single</i>

1577
01:53:51,447 --> 01:53:53,971
- <i>and is trying for a second run.</i>
- Why take the second run?

1578
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,052
<i>And he's out!</i>

1579
01:54:09,356 --> 01:54:10,694
"Where we come from."

1580
01:54:10,814 --> 01:54:12,938
"We are the England."

1581
01:54:13,299 --> 01:54:14,601
You idiot!

1582
01:54:17,053 --> 01:54:20,547
<i>Amarnath returns, making 46 runs.
A crucial wicket.</i>

1583
01:54:22,692 --> 01:54:25,089
<i>India at 142 for 3.</i>

1584
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:30,880
Yash, hang in there for 60 overs.

1585
01:54:31,084 --> 01:54:33,984
- I'll hit now.
- OK, Patla.

1586
01:54:42,265 --> 01:54:43,357
<i>That's a four.</i>

1587
01:54:43,792 --> 01:54:47,136
<i>And that's an excellent 50
for Yashpal Sharma.</i>

1588
01:54:48,463 --> 01:54:51,110
<i>Another half century for Sharma
in this tournament.</i>

1589
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:52,295
Shall I hit? Or will you?

1590
01:54:52,415 --> 01:54:55,130
Tell you what, we'll hit together.

1591
01:54:55,870 --> 01:54:57,064
Not a bad idea!

1592
01:55:00,961 --> 01:55:03,379
<i>Patil showcasing his big hits.</i>

1593
01:55:05,181 --> 01:55:07,577
<i>Sharma continues the onslaught
at the other end</i>

1594
01:55:07,697 --> 01:55:10,331
<i>to the delight of the Indian fans.</i>

1595
01:55:19,407 --> 01:55:21,635
<i>Patil is seriously punishing
the English bowlers.</i>

1596
01:55:21,755 --> 01:55:23,630
Madipaa, let the match be over.

1597
01:55:23,755 --> 01:55:27,710
You guys always get the bottle first.
Today it's my turn.

1598
01:55:28,981 --> 01:55:31,265
<i>Patil has hit it for a four.</i>

1599
01:55:31,385 --> 01:55:32,718
<i>The score is now 200.</i>

1600
01:55:32,838 --> 01:55:34,546
<i>Indian fans are delighted!</i>

1601
01:55:34,671 --> 01:55:36,713
<i>Patil's entrance has
changed the game again.</i>

1602
01:55:36,838 --> 01:55:39,577
<i>He has once again punished Willis,
just like he did last year.</i>

1603
01:55:39,697 --> 01:55:41,833
Wasn't that Kulwant just there?

1604
01:55:42,512 --> 01:55:44,970
No, sir, no Kulwant.

1605
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:03,661
<i>It's in the air.</i>

1606
01:56:03,853 --> 01:56:05,291
<i>Allott is getting under it.</i>

1607
01:56:05,421 --> 01:56:08,592
<i>And it's... it's a marvellous catch.</i>

1608
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:11,661
Madipaa!

1609
01:56:15,264 --> 01:56:18,688
<i>Yashpal Sharma walks back.
He's been the pillar of the Indian innings</i>

1610
01:56:21,041 --> 01:56:25,449
<i>India now 205 for 4 as the
Captain walks in.</i>

1611
01:56:31,498 --> 01:56:33,885
<i>Three runs needed for
India to reach the Finals.</i>

1612
01:56:34,379 --> 01:56:35,838
<i>Plays it into the covers.</i>

1613
01:56:36,432 --> 01:56:39,211
<i>That's one, they take another.</i>

1614
01:56:39,588 --> 01:56:41,445
<i>Oh no! There's been an invasion.</i>

1615
01:56:41,565 --> 01:56:43,676
<i>A premature invasion on the field.</i>

1616
01:56:43,796 --> 01:56:46,738
<i>Indian fans celebrating
a bit too early.</i>

1617
01:57:01,781 --> 01:57:04,038
<i>Willis waiting for the field
to be cleared.</i>

1618
01:57:04,359 --> 01:57:06,963
<i>This might just be the last ball
of the match.</i>

1619
01:57:08,404 --> 01:57:10,270
Fellows move over.

1620
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:15,144
<i>Willis asking for a most
unorthodox field.</i>

1621
01:57:15,264 --> 01:57:18,327
<i>He has asked all his players
to move to the off side.</i>

1622
01:57:18,447 --> 01:57:22,576
<i>So that they can escape
if there is another invasion.</i>

1623
01:57:38,287 --> 01:57:42,187
<i>And that's it. It's off the edge
and it goes for a four.</i>

1624
01:57:44,732 --> 01:57:48,075
<i>India is through to the Finals</i>

1625
01:57:48,296 --> 01:57:51,702
<i>of the 1983 World Cup.</i>

1626
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:12,105
<i>India is now through to the Finals.
What a historic day for Indian cricket.</i>

1627
01:58:31,336 --> 01:58:33,234
For my father.

1628
01:58:46,249 --> 01:58:49,043
Hey, you bloody Pakis!

1629
01:58:49,212 --> 01:58:51,981
Stop playing that stupid
drum and bugger off!

1630
01:58:52,668 --> 01:58:54,338
Shall we go?

1631
01:58:54,690 --> 01:58:56,194
Why should we?

1632
01:58:56,546 --> 01:58:59,002
We won the match
and we can't celebrate.

1633
01:58:59,241 --> 01:59:01,255
- Didn't you hear what he said?
- Play, Jassi.

1634
01:59:01,463 --> 01:59:04,022
- Bugger off!
- Play, Jassi.

1635
01:59:33,687 --> 01:59:35,508
Piss off!

1636
01:59:40,463 --> 01:59:41,671
Never mind!

1637
01:59:42,755 --> 01:59:45,488
Kapil will fix them in the Finals.

1638
01:59:49,294 --> 01:59:50,630
Yes, Papa.

1639
01:59:59,013 --> 02:00:00,326
Lala-ji?

1640
02:00:01,487 --> 02:00:02,499
What did he say?

1641
02:00:04,005 --> 02:00:06,630
He said: "My son,

1642
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:14,713
today you have made me feel
ten years younger."

1643
02:00:25,368 --> 02:00:27,877
Don't tell anyone I'm crying.

1644
02:00:30,203 --> 02:00:33,101
There's a message from
forward post for you, sir.

1645
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:35,421
Sir, the soldiers want to hear

1646
02:00:35,657 --> 02:00:37,325
the latest score of the Finals

1647
02:00:37,445 --> 02:00:40,463
- every ten minutes.
- How do I do that?

1648
02:00:41,298 --> 02:00:42,630
The moment the match starts,

1649
02:00:42,755 --> 02:00:45,994
the Pakistani Major Sadiq
will start firing.

1650
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:48,150
Do they ever let us hear
the commentary?

1651
02:00:48,671 --> 02:00:51,505
They fire at us whenever
there's a big match on.

1652
02:00:51,796 --> 02:00:54,271
World Cup TV fund.
World Cup TV fund.

1653
02:00:56,212 --> 02:00:57,830
Sir, sir!

1654
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:59,426
World Cup TV fund, sir.

1655
02:00:59,546 --> 02:01:01,982
You want a TV?
But we have a radio in the hostel.

1656
02:01:02,102 --> 02:01:04,301
A TV is a must, sir.

1657
02:01:04,421 --> 02:01:07,070
Radio or TV,
it's the same thing.

1658
02:01:08,017 --> 02:01:10,835
Sir, take my cycle.
Give me your car.

1659
02:01:11,338 --> 02:01:13,588
- Same thing, sir!
- Get lost.

1660
02:01:14,527 --> 02:01:18,931
Good news! If we win,
each player gets 25,000.

1661
02:01:19,051 --> 02:01:20,551
You crazy?
You'll give us 25,000?

1662
02:01:20,671 --> 02:01:23,282
The Cricket Board will.
I just heard it.

1663
02:01:24,129 --> 02:01:25,555
Ever seen 25,000?

1664
02:01:26,255 --> 02:01:28,005
It's probably for the whole team.

1665
02:01:28,817 --> 02:01:29,838
How much?

1666
02:01:29,958 --> 02:01:33,130
25,000, Roger! Just imagine.

1667
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:35,755
Our Sunny, Gavaskar.

1668
02:01:36,126 --> 02:01:37,421
He used to play cricket here.

1669
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:39,583
He's broken our windows
so many times.

1670
02:01:39,703 --> 02:01:42,505
But I always returned the ball
to him.

1671
02:01:42,684 --> 02:01:45,022
Children must be encouraged.

1672
02:01:46,671 --> 02:01:48,578
Oh God! There goes our window.

1673
02:01:49,149 --> 02:01:53,411
You fool. Do you think
you're Sunil Gavaskar?

1674
02:01:53,531 --> 02:01:57,317
- How many more tickets?
- At least four more.

1675
02:01:57,437 --> 02:01:58,755
I want four tickets too.

1676
02:01:58,933 --> 02:02:01,463
You're driving me crazy.

1677
02:02:01,666 --> 02:02:03,630
I don't have any tickets
for the Finals.

1678
02:02:03,755 --> 02:02:06,171
Don't talk about a ticket
ever again.

1679
02:02:06,296 --> 02:02:07,630
Now hang up!

1680
02:02:08,127 --> 02:02:09,309
What the hell do you want?

1681
02:02:09,429 --> 02:02:11,671
Do you have any hot water
in your bathroom?

1682
02:02:11,796 --> 02:02:13,546
- Is there any hot water?
- Yes.

1683
02:02:13,671 --> 02:02:16,818
Madi, you shower here.
I'll wait downstairs.

1684
02:02:16,938 --> 02:02:18,442
He wants to shower.

1685
02:02:18,762 --> 02:02:20,412
Yes, it'll be done.

1686
02:02:21,222 --> 02:02:23,099
I'll talk to him.

1687
02:02:23,404 --> 02:02:25,134
Thank you, bye.

1688
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,588
Kapil, we need more tickets.
They've all arrived.

1689
02:02:28,713 --> 02:02:32,338
- I gave you the four tickets I had.
- I need some more.

1690
02:02:32,463 --> 02:02:34,426
- Hello?
- What "hello?" You "hello."

1691
02:02:34,546 --> 02:02:36,505
Want me to print them myself?

1692
02:02:36,671 --> 02:02:37,938
Come!

1693
02:02:39,138 --> 02:02:40,013
Hi, Romi.

1694
02:02:40,133 --> 02:02:44,172
Kaps, my boss is arriving tomorrow
from Nirlon. I need some passes.

1695
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:47,381
- How many?
- Two or three.

1696
02:02:47,546 --> 02:02:49,265
OK, Sunny. You'll get them.

1697
02:02:50,062 --> 02:02:51,728
- See you.
- Bye.

1698
02:02:54,382 --> 02:02:57,799
- Let me concentrate on the match.
- At least get their rooms organised.

1699
02:02:57,919 --> 02:02:58,763
Tell you what.

1700
02:02:58,883 --> 02:03:01,846
They can sleep here.
I'll sleep in the bathroom.

1701
02:03:20,035 --> 02:03:23,893
I say before, we here to win.

1702
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:34,277
One question at a time.

1703
02:03:54,028 --> 02:03:56,026
This was your dream.

1704
02:03:57,921 --> 02:04:00,756
It's every cricketer's dream.

1705
02:04:01,933 --> 02:04:03,669
Lord's.

1706
02:04:05,713 --> 02:04:09,921
India has never won a single match
in this stadium.

1707
02:04:14,635 --> 02:04:17,734
India has never made it
to the World Cup Finals either.

1708
02:04:22,724 --> 02:04:24,847
Are you scared?

1709
02:04:26,982 --> 02:04:28,412
Very.

1710
02:04:33,335 --> 02:04:36,391
Kapil Dev is all grown up.

1711
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:40,055
He's India's cricket Captain.

1712
02:04:40,505 --> 02:04:45,507
He's broken a World Record
and even reached the Finals.

1713
02:04:48,463 --> 02:04:53,697
Behind this Kapil Dev
is a small kid, Kuku.

1714
02:04:57,068 --> 02:05:00,018
A kid who played because
he loved playing cricket.

1715
02:05:05,542 --> 02:05:07,549
Play for that boy today.

1716
02:05:22,256 --> 02:05:26,421
Sir, Pakistan's Major Sadiq
is on the hotline.

1717
02:05:26,546 --> 02:05:28,463
The hotline? Now what?

1718
02:05:29,005 --> 02:05:30,463
Yes, Major Sadiq?

1719
02:05:33,796 --> 02:05:36,463
Yes. Thank you.

1720
02:05:43,265 --> 02:05:48,373
He said we can enjoy the game.
There won't be any firing today.

1721
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:53,076
<i>Although the English cricket press</i>

1722
02:05:53,201 --> 02:05:56,777
<i>had given India no chance of ever
reaching even the semi-finals,</i>

1723
02:05:56,897 --> 02:06:00,368
<i>India rose to the occasion and
has surprised the cricketing world</i>

1724
02:06:00,493 --> 02:06:04,000
<i>by reaching the World Cup Finals
here at Lord's.</i>

1725
02:06:04,192 --> 02:06:08,311
<i>But of course the favorites
remain the mighty West Indies.</i>

1726
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:09,435
Sir, one ticket?

1727
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:12,932
One ticket, sir. Give me one ticket,
my fair friend.

1728
02:06:22,308 --> 02:06:26,516
<i>On this pitch whoever wins the toss
definitely has the upper hand.</i>

1729
02:06:26,636 --> 02:06:28,518
<i>The conditions are best for bowling.</i>

1730
02:06:28,638 --> 02:06:30,418
<i>I think so too, Johners.</i>

1731
02:06:31,366 --> 02:06:32,722
Toss, please.

1732
02:06:32,945 --> 02:06:35,022
That's heads, that's tails.

1733
02:06:40,601 --> 02:06:42,203
Heads!

1734
02:06:45,779 --> 02:06:47,167
Heads it is.

1735
02:06:48,972 --> 02:06:51,708
<i>West Indies wins the toss and
choose to bowl first.</i>

1736
02:06:51,828 --> 02:06:54,626
<i>Advantage West Indies
on this green top.</i>

1737
02:06:55,375 --> 02:06:58,208
Come on, hurry up. Let's go!

1738
02:06:59,938 --> 02:07:01,722
They're here!

1739
02:07:07,874 --> 02:07:09,083
How's the pitch?

1740
02:07:10,244 --> 02:07:11,739
It's a green.

1741
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:13,791
Openers, be cautious.

1742
02:07:15,534 --> 02:07:17,399
Specially you, Cheeka.

1743
02:07:18,374 --> 02:07:19,791
Don't throw away wicket.

1744
02:07:20,416 --> 02:07:21,708
OK, Kapsi.

1745
02:07:33,999 --> 02:07:38,833
<i>Openers Sunil Gavaskar and Srikkanth
making their way to the pitch.</i>

1746
02:07:38,953 --> 02:07:42,208
<i>All of India is watching
these two players right now.</i>

1747
02:07:42,374 --> 02:07:45,333
<i>It's the first time the Indian team
has reached a World Cup Final.</i>

1748
02:07:45,458 --> 02:07:47,958
<i>The stadium is packed to the rafters.</i>

1749
02:07:48,083 --> 02:07:53,739
<i>The huge crowds have forced
the organisers to extend the stands.</i>

1750
02:07:54,319 --> 02:07:57,126
Sachin, hurry up!
The match is starting.

1751
02:08:02,916 --> 02:08:05,318
<i>Sunny Gavaskar will face the first ball.</i>

1752
02:08:05,438 --> 02:08:10,783
<i>Every Indian is hoping he builds
on the rhythm he found in the semi-finals.</i>

1753
02:08:10,976 --> 02:08:12,695
Play.

1754
02:08:15,108 --> 02:08:18,697
<i>Hitman Andy Roberts.. tries to play it,
but misses the ball.</i>

1755
02:08:18,817 --> 02:08:20,587
<i>A fiery first ball.</i>

1756
02:08:26,449 --> 02:08:27,809
<i>A good decision leaving that ball.</i>

1757
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:29,791
<i>Aggressive bowling by Roberts.</i>

1758
02:08:29,916 --> 02:08:32,208
<i>A tense start for the Indians.</i>

1759
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:35,581
<i>The opening batsmen have to
play with caution.</i>

1760
02:08:38,791 --> 02:08:40,583
<i>Garner to Gavaskar.</i>

1761
02:08:42,223 --> 02:08:44,583
<i>Almost catches the outside edge.</i>

1762
02:08:44,703 --> 02:08:46,791
Come on! Over here!

1763
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:52,666
<i>The ball rises sharply and
hits Srikkanth on the gloves.</i>

1764
02:08:52,786 --> 02:08:55,416
That was too good for him, Bird.

1765
02:09:00,523 --> 02:09:03,083
<i>5th over and India has only 2 runs
on the board.</i>

1766
02:09:09,671 --> 02:09:10,791
<i>And that's Gavaskar's gone.</i>

1767
02:09:10,916 --> 02:09:14,958
<i>Beautifully bowled by Andy Roberts
and he's taken the first Indian wicket.</i>

1768
02:09:15,083 --> 02:09:16,333
<i>That's the one they wanted.</i>

1769
02:09:16,458 --> 02:09:18,874
<i>Gavaskar, the great Indian batsman
with the score at 2.</i>

1770
02:09:18,999 --> 02:09:21,541
So that's first blood
for Clive Lloyd's team.

1771
02:09:22,819 --> 02:09:26,285
<i>That brings one of the best players
of pace to the wicket.</i>

1772
02:09:26,567 --> 02:09:28,494
<i>Can he take the attack to the Windies?</i>

1773
02:09:29,499 --> 02:09:31,627
Jimmy, we love you!

1774
02:09:33,655 --> 02:09:35,935
<i>Amarnath pushes the ball
for a quick single.</i>

1775
02:09:36,055 --> 02:09:38,214
<i>West Indies keeping it very tight.</i>

1776
02:09:39,791 --> 02:09:41,315
Good single.

1777
02:09:44,552 --> 02:09:47,011
<i>Garner is unplayable out there
at the moment.</i>

1778
02:09:47,131 --> 02:09:48,638
Well done, Bird. Well done!

1779
02:09:48,958 --> 02:09:51,671
What happened, man?
Too fast for you?

1780
02:09:52,041 --> 02:09:55,004
Cheeka, go easy!

1781
02:09:55,124 --> 02:09:57,958
Jimpa, I can't play slow
and don't know technique.

1782
02:09:58,083 --> 02:09:59,723
If I had technique,
I'd be Sunil Gavaskar.

1783
02:09:59,791 --> 02:10:04,206
I don't know how to play defence.
I only know how to hit.

1784
02:10:05,236 --> 02:10:07,697
Go ahead and hit.

1785
02:10:14,249 --> 02:10:16,464
- Shall I?
- Hit!

1786
02:10:18,468 --> 02:10:20,557
Damn if I do, damn if I don't.

1787
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:23,608
Now watch me hit.

1788
02:10:31,143 --> 02:10:33,624
<i>Srikkanth slashes at another short
pitched delivery</i>

1789
02:10:33,749 --> 02:10:35,419
<i>and it flies over the keeper's head.</i>

1790
02:10:35,539 --> 02:10:39,879
<i>Looks like Srikkanth has decided
he's been respectable long enough.</i>

1791
02:10:39,999 --> 02:10:42,935
What happened, man?
Too fast for you?

1792
02:10:43,631 --> 02:10:45,918
Bravo, Cheeka!

1793
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:53,379
<i>Don't know what the batsmen talked about,
but Srikkanth has changed his game.</i>

1794
02:10:53,499 --> 02:10:55,784
<i>Indian fans are just loving this.</i>

1795
02:10:56,416 --> 02:10:59,566
<i>Amarnath has pulled this towards
deep square leg.</i>

1796
02:11:03,748 --> 02:11:07,183
<i>Oh, what a beautiful shot!</i>

1797
02:11:09,107 --> 02:11:11,833
<i>That was meant to be
the quicker bouncer,</i>

1798
02:11:11,958 --> 02:11:16,765
<i>but Srikkanth was waiting for it
and sent it flying to the boundary.</i>

1799
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:19,958
<i>And again. Beautiful!</i>

1800
02:11:20,186 --> 02:11:22,894
<i>This is clearly the shot
of the tournament.</i>

1801
02:11:24,333 --> 02:11:27,161
<i>Even the great Vivian Richards
is applauding that shot.</i>

1802
02:11:28,791 --> 02:11:30,931
<i>The Indians are loving this.</i>

1803
02:11:35,458 --> 02:11:36,458
<i>What a shot!</i>

1804
02:11:36,499 --> 02:11:39,504
<i>That's the third time he's smashed
this West Indian pace attack</i>

1805
02:11:39,624 --> 02:11:41,999
<i>away to the square leg boundary.</i>

1806
02:11:45,329 --> 02:11:47,624
<i>Oh, it's in the air. Logie misses it.</i>

1807
02:11:47,749 --> 02:11:50,713
<i>Luck is going India's way.
Almost got him that time.</i>

1808
02:11:50,833 --> 02:11:51,833
<i>In the air again.</i>

1809
02:11:51,869 --> 02:11:52,869
<i>From the meat of the bat.</i>

1810
02:11:52,916 --> 02:11:55,122
<i>Screams away towards the pavilion
for a four.</i>

1811
02:11:56,499 --> 02:12:00,129
<i>Quick inswinger from Marshall
hits straight on the pads. It's out!</i>

1812
02:12:00,249 --> 02:12:01,916
<i>The second big blow for India.</i>

1813
02:12:02,083 --> 02:12:05,603
<i>Short but enterprising innings
comes to an end.</i>

1814
02:12:05,723 --> 02:12:09,594
<i>38 runs including a 6 and 7 fours.</i>

1815
02:12:17,791 --> 02:12:20,025
<i>Magnificent shot by Amarnath.</i>

1816
02:12:26,008 --> 02:12:30,849
<i>Clean bowled. Beautiful ball!
Amarnath is out at 26.</i>

1817
02:12:31,249 --> 02:12:34,595
<i>India now 90 for 3
in the 30th over.</i>

1818
02:12:34,715 --> 02:12:38,540
<i>Half the match over and the
run rate at just 3 per over.</i>

1819
02:12:40,166 --> 02:12:43,913
<i>Gomes to Yashpal. In the air</i>

1820
02:12:44,908 --> 02:12:47,465
<i>and caught by the substitute Logie.</i>

1821
02:12:47,585 --> 02:12:49,081
<i>Something of a tragedy for India.</i>

1822
02:12:49,201 --> 02:12:52,573
<i>Losing two wickets in quick succession.
92 for 4 now.</i>

1823
02:12:52,693 --> 02:12:54,487
India in trouble.

1824
02:13:03,686 --> 02:13:08,326
<i>And here comes Kapil Dev,
the last remaining hope for India.</i>

1825
02:13:12,082 --> 02:13:14,772
Kapil Dev!

1826
02:13:16,221 --> 02:13:18,219
Come on, Viv.

1827
02:13:18,339 --> 02:13:23,652
<i>Richards to Kapil..
Hits strongly for 4.</i>

1828
02:13:28,255 --> 02:13:31,132
<i>Another smash hit from
the Haryana Hurricane!</i>

1829
02:13:31,373 --> 02:13:36,022
<i>Kapil knows India needs
to take charge right now.</i>

1830
02:13:43,605 --> 02:13:46,397
<i>That's 15 runs from just 8 balls.</i>

1831
02:13:46,522 --> 02:13:50,485
<i>For Kapil after Tunbridge Wells
anything is possible when he's around.</i>

1832
02:13:50,605 --> 02:13:53,746
<i>Kapil swings at another one
and it's gone high in the air</i>

1833
02:13:53,866 --> 02:13:55,943
<i>towards the long on boundary.</i>

1834
02:13:57,645 --> 02:13:59,493
Catch it.

1835
02:14:01,412 --> 02:14:03,502
<i>Looks like it's going to be a six.</i>

1836
02:14:12,061 --> 02:14:14,861
<i>That's a tragedy as far as
India is concerned.</i>

1837
02:14:14,981 --> 02:14:19,283
<i>Gomes has picked up the vital wicket
of the Indian Captain.</i>

1838
02:14:27,765 --> 02:14:29,211
<i>Roberts to Azad.</i>

1839
02:14:29,402 --> 02:14:30,943
Catch it.

1840
02:14:31,433 --> 02:14:33,284
<i>Kirti Azad is out without scoring.</i>

1841
02:14:33,404 --> 02:14:37,530
<i>India are now 6 down for 111
and in an awful lot of trouble.</i>

1842
02:14:38,739 --> 02:14:39,944
<i>Binny goes for two.</i>

1843
02:14:40,064 --> 02:14:42,986
<i>This is definitely a big
blow for India. Two quick wickets.</i>

1844
02:14:43,106 --> 02:14:46,715
<i>India now sinks deeper
at 130 for 7.</i>

1845
02:14:47,643 --> 02:14:51,377
<i>Patil goes down on his knees and
thumps it for 6 at square leg.</i>

1846
02:14:57,866 --> 02:14:59,590
<i>3 more runs for Patil.</i>

1847
02:14:59,710 --> 02:15:01,624
<i>Every run is vital for India.</i>

1848
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:06,804
<i>Madan Lal has hit that
for a big six.</i>

1849
02:15:06,924 --> 02:15:09,365
Catch it.

1850
02:15:12,383 --> 02:15:14,738
<i>That's in the air
and that's got to be out.</i>

1851
02:15:14,935 --> 02:15:19,276
<i>And yes! Larry Gomes at mid-on
makes no mistake with that one.</i>

1852
02:15:24,164 --> 02:15:27,485
<i>Oh, that was a fast one from Marshall.</i>

1853
02:15:27,605 --> 02:15:30,211
<i>The West Indies are loving every moment.</i>

1854
02:15:30,331 --> 02:15:30,885
Ballu!

1855
02:15:31,005 --> 02:15:34,941
<i>That was a bit of their magical
pace they would say.</i>

1856
02:15:35,179 --> 02:15:39,112
- <i>India are now 161 for 9.</i>
- Ballu.

1857
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:41,277
<i>Just one wicket left.</i>

1858
02:15:41,597 --> 02:15:44,314
<i>Is it all over for India now?</i>

1859
02:15:53,492 --> 02:15:56,829
<i>Ballu, no matter what's going on
in our lives</i>

1860
02:15:57,906 --> 02:16:01,569
when we walk onto the pitch
in our uniforms

1861
02:16:02,578 --> 02:16:04,306
we have only one purpose.

1862
02:16:10,722 --> 02:16:13,931
To play for our country
with all our hearts.

1863
02:16:19,435 --> 02:16:22,027
Whatever might be happening
for us personally -

1864
02:16:22,152 --> 02:16:23,700
no one knows or cares.

1865
02:16:23,869 --> 02:16:27,397
<i>But what we achieve
on this ground today</i>

1866
02:16:28,157 --> 02:16:32,277
will be linked to our names forever.

1867
02:16:33,692 --> 02:16:37,361
This day will never return.

1868
02:16:40,350 --> 02:16:42,290
Hammer them.

1869
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:16,319
Ballu, are you all right?

1870
02:17:16,630 --> 02:17:18,111
Are you OK?

1871
02:17:20,161 --> 02:17:22,499
You don't bowl bouncers
at number ten.

1872
02:17:22,619 --> 02:17:24,172
I won't have it.

1873
02:17:27,930 --> 02:17:31,500
<i>Wins and losses should show
only on the scoreboard</i>

1874
02:17:31,981 --> 02:17:33,961
<i>not in our eyes.</i>

1875
02:17:37,027 --> 02:17:41,380
<i>Oh, well struck. Sandhu stands his ground
and hits Marshall towards mid on.</i>

1876
02:17:41,913 --> 02:17:44,861
<i>These two putting on
invaluable runs for India.</i>

1877
02:17:44,981 --> 02:17:48,746
<i>India now at 183 for 9.</i>

1878
02:17:57,042 --> 02:18:00,012
<i>Bowled him... it's all over.</i>

1879
02:18:00,245 --> 02:18:01,621
<i>That's the end.</i>

1880
02:18:01,741 --> 02:18:04,450
<i>Very gallant batting by the
last two Indian batsmen.</i>

1881
02:18:04,570 --> 02:18:08,096
<i>They put on 22 more runs
when it all seemed to be over.</i>

1882
02:18:08,216 --> 02:18:10,327
<i>Sandhu remains unbeaten on 11</i>

1883
02:18:10,447 --> 02:18:15,942
<i>and India are all out for
183 in just 54 overs.</i>

1884
02:18:16,172 --> 02:18:19,141
Sit down. Come on, sit down!

1885
02:18:19,261 --> 02:18:23,205
<i>In limited overs cricket, being bowled
out in less than the available overs</i>

1886
02:18:23,325 --> 02:18:27,405
<i>is a matter of great shame,
especially in a World Cup Final.</i>

1887
02:18:35,445 --> 02:18:39,042
I hear whistling in my ear.
I was hit just below the ear.

1888
02:18:39,306 --> 02:18:42,182
It felt like all the slaps I got
at school had landed in one go.

1889
02:18:44,133 --> 02:18:45,962
No, it's the truth!

1890
02:18:48,403 --> 02:18:50,099
Here. Take this.

1891
02:18:52,899 --> 02:18:54,153
You'll be fine.

1892
02:18:54,273 --> 02:18:56,068
Well done, it's OK.

1893
02:18:56,442 --> 02:18:57,816
Get ready to bowl.

1894
02:18:58,316 --> 02:19:03,446
<i>183 is the lowest score ever
in a World Cup Final.</i>

1895
02:19:04,150 --> 02:19:07,249
<i>Had it been England, we could've
called it a Final.</i>

1896
02:19:07,490 --> 02:19:09,733
<i>At least we would've had
an interesting match.</i>

1897
02:19:10,025 --> 02:19:13,316
Come on. Come on, soldiers.
Let's fight!

1898
02:19:14,066 --> 02:19:16,946
Let them say they were batting
better than us.

1899
02:19:17,066 --> 02:19:19,647
Bowling and fielding better
than us. It's OK.

1900
02:19:19,767 --> 02:19:23,733
They just shouldn't say they were
trying harder than us.

1901
02:19:26,075 --> 02:19:28,757
I know we didn't get a high score.
But we did score.

1902
02:19:29,582 --> 02:19:32,863
And they have yet to score 183 runs.

1903
02:19:32,983 --> 02:19:36,066
We won't let that happen.
Come what may.

1904
02:19:39,233 --> 02:19:41,025
The game boils down to that.

1905
02:19:44,896 --> 02:19:48,150
Hey guys, this is your first
World Cup Final, so smile!

1906
02:19:50,411 --> 02:19:52,594
Come on, smile.

1907
02:20:02,633 --> 02:20:06,650
What we do here today
is that everybody fight.

1908
02:20:06,775 --> 02:20:09,525
Fight for our life
and we will do that.

1909
02:20:10,117 --> 02:20:12,525
Because like people says

1910
02:20:19,567 --> 02:20:21,941
Taste the success once...

1911
02:20:24,316 --> 02:20:26,598
Taste success once...

1912
02:20:26,777 --> 02:20:29,108
tongue wants more!

1913
02:20:29,404 --> 02:20:32,128
Here, catch! Make sure you catch
on the field too.

1914
02:20:32,416 --> 02:20:33,946
You don't give me an option only.

1915
02:20:34,066 --> 02:20:36,150
You laugh when I speak English.

1916
02:20:37,805 --> 02:20:40,191
183 is enough

1917
02:20:42,402 --> 02:20:46,304
if we fight for every run.

1918
02:21:15,566 --> 02:21:18,191
<i>The West Indies fans dancing
to the calypso beat.</i>

1919
02:21:18,316 --> 02:21:21,394
<i>They'll be hoping it's a repeat
of the semi-finals against Pakistan</i>

1920
02:21:21,514 --> 02:21:26,093
<i>where they chased down 184
with 8 wickets to spare.</i>

1921
02:21:30,191 --> 02:21:32,275
<i>The first over by the Captain
is a maiden.</i>

1922
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:34,946
<i>Looks like the Indians will fight
for every run.</i>

1923
02:21:35,066 --> 02:21:36,525
<i>Sandhu to Greenidge.</i>

1924
02:21:36,910 --> 02:21:38,792
<i>And that outswinger
almost finding the edge.</i>

1925
02:21:38,912 --> 02:21:40,217
Ballu!

1926
02:21:41,454 --> 02:21:42,697
Play your inswinger.

1927
02:21:43,473 --> 02:21:45,624
And listen, hide it!

1928
02:21:48,537 --> 02:21:50,788
<i>An extra man on the
off side for Sandhu.</i>

1929
02:22:04,899 --> 02:22:07,441
<i>And he's bowled him!
Would you believe it?</i>

1930
02:22:07,608 --> 02:22:08,804
<i>What a ball!</i>

1931
02:22:08,983 --> 02:22:13,772
<i>It looked like it would go out but
the ball cut back in quite sharply.</i>

1932
02:22:13,983 --> 02:22:17,483
<i>Sandhu has managed to fool a man
of Gordon Greenidge's experience.</i>

1933
02:22:17,603 --> 02:22:21,369
<i>An early breakthrough for India.
West Indies are 5 for 1.</i>

1934
02:22:22,806 --> 02:22:24,887
<i>And in comes Viv Richards.</i>

1935
02:22:25,007 --> 02:22:28,446
<i>And he's been in smashing form with three
man of the match award in four games.</i>

1936
02:22:28,566 --> 02:22:30,441
He's arrived. Keep it tight, Sardar.

1937
02:22:30,608 --> 02:22:33,634
You'll get him out too. Come on.

1938
02:22:34,733 --> 02:22:37,150
You said something to him,
I was watching.

1939
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:39,339
Kaps, what medicine did you
give Ballu?

1940
02:22:40,157 --> 02:22:41,358
Vitamin C.

1941
02:22:43,448 --> 02:22:45,908
- Keep at it, Sardar.
- Come on, Ballu.

1942
02:22:55,401 --> 02:22:57,030
<i>Sandhu to Richards.</i>

1943
02:22:57,504 --> 02:23:01,458
<i>Pulled away powerfully. Four runs.
No problem. That's Richards.</i>

1944
02:23:05,269 --> 02:23:08,411
<i>Richards does make this look
awfully easy. Superbly timed.</i>

1945
02:23:12,382 --> 02:23:15,097
<i>Kapil to Richards.
And it's another boundary.</i>

1946
02:23:15,217 --> 02:23:18,268
<i>Pakistan made 184 in the semi-final.</i>

1947
02:23:18,388 --> 02:23:21,372
<i>That is one more run
than India's total today.</i>

1948
02:23:21,492 --> 02:23:25,700
<i>While Viv has made 80 runs
with 11 fours and one sixer.</i>

1949
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:28,196
<i>Single-handedly winning the match
for his team.</i>

1950
02:23:28,316 --> 02:23:30,191
Viv is going to kill you.

1951
02:23:30,436 --> 02:23:32,398
He's going to eat you up!

1952
02:23:32,518 --> 02:23:35,004
<i>That's probably what he has in mind.</i>

1953
02:24:07,233 --> 02:24:10,989
<i>Beautiful drive! Madan Lal gets
the same treatment.</i>

1954
02:24:32,568 --> 02:24:34,920
<i>That's the third four.</i>

1955
02:24:36,819 --> 02:24:39,735
<i>The match is slipping away
from the Indians.</i>

1956
02:24:42,127 --> 02:24:44,307
How has it happened?

1957
02:24:47,105 --> 02:24:49,340
What's this nonsense?
Let's go.

1958
02:24:55,899 --> 02:24:58,786
He hit Madan for three fours
in one over.

1959
02:24:59,501 --> 02:25:01,591
I can't bear to watch.

1960
02:25:02,285 --> 02:25:05,735
<i>Kapil might want to change things
around after that last Madan Lal over.</i>

1961
02:25:05,855 --> 02:25:08,858
<i>Viv had 33 from just 27 balls.</i>

1962
02:25:08,983 --> 02:25:10,901
Kapil, give me another over.

1963
02:25:11,021 --> 02:25:12,717
No, Madipaa. You'd better rest.

1964
02:25:12,837 --> 02:25:14,811
Kapil, I've set him.
Give me one more over.

1965
02:25:15,549 --> 02:25:17,267
No, he'll give you a hammering.

1966
02:25:18,745 --> 02:25:20,938
Kapil, he has it in for me.

1967
02:25:21,275 --> 02:25:23,608
He's batting like it's a match
of 30 overs.

1968
02:25:23,841 --> 02:25:26,574
He's overconfident. I'll take
advantage of that. Give me an over.

1969
02:25:26,694 --> 02:25:28,571
No, Madipaa. It's too risky.

1970
02:25:30,376 --> 02:25:32,441
He doesn't believe
I'm a bowler, Kaps.

1971
02:25:32,617 --> 02:25:35,746
Give me an over.
I want to show him.

1972
02:25:41,431 --> 02:25:42,902
Just one over, Kaps.

1973
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:48,732
Ballu.

1974
02:25:53,569 --> 02:25:55,943
<i>Madan Lal is given another over.</i>

1975
02:25:57,326 --> 02:25:59,644
<i>The Captain is taking a big risk.</i>

1976
02:26:19,819 --> 02:26:23,114
Stop, Yash, stop!

1977
02:26:51,173 --> 02:26:54,289
<i>Richards has hit that away to
within 15 yards of the boundary</i>

1978
02:26:54,409 --> 02:26:58,272
<i>and the Indian skipper has done
a tremendous job to run back there.</i>

1979
02:26:58,392 --> 02:27:01,803
<i>Marvellous running catch.
One of the finest ever taken.</i>

1980
02:27:05,350 --> 02:27:09,240
<i>This was the wicket India desperately
needed to stay in the game.</i>

1981
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:12,611
<i>Richards departs for 33 runs.</i>

1982
02:27:17,109 --> 02:27:19,256
Ladies, ladies.
Where are your passes?

1983
02:27:20,204 --> 02:27:21,733
We threw them away.

1984
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:24,358
We thought we were losing but
now we want to go back inside.

1985
02:27:24,536 --> 02:27:26,608
Sorry, ladies. No entry without
a pass.

1986
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:29,185
<i>Madan Lal to Lloyd.</i>

1987
02:27:33,660 --> 02:27:37,215
<i>That doesn't look good.
The West Indies Captain is limping.</i>

1988
02:27:37,335 --> 02:27:38,655
Can I have a runner, please?

1989
02:27:38,853 --> 02:27:40,220
Please. Please, we must go inside.

1990
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:41,512
I'm Kapil Dev's wife.

1991
02:27:41,677 --> 02:27:43,730
Yes, sure, and I'm
the King of England!

1992
02:27:43,850 --> 02:27:45,431
Ladies, please step aside.

1993
02:27:49,373 --> 02:27:51,233
<i>Madan Lal gets another one!</i>

1994
02:27:51,358 --> 02:27:54,432
<i>This is tremendous from India.
Absolutely fantastic.</i>

1995
02:27:54,552 --> 02:27:56,303
Ladies, please.

1996
02:27:56,893 --> 02:27:58,785
Let's watch it on TV.

1997
02:28:00,189 --> 02:28:02,472
- Is it working?
- No!

1998
02:28:02,705 --> 02:28:04,788
- Now?
- No!

1999
02:28:05,333 --> 02:28:07,900
- Has it come now?
- Turn it properly.

2000
02:28:08,536 --> 02:28:09,766
What do you mean? No signal?

2001
02:28:09,886 --> 02:28:11,603
Someone, pick up the phone.

2002
02:28:11,879 --> 02:28:13,275
We're trying our best.

2003
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:15,046
Our lives depend on this and
you've lost the signal.

2004
02:28:15,070 --> 02:28:17,216
No one disrupted the signal
on purpose.

2005
02:28:17,336 --> 02:28:19,375
When will it come back?
When the match is over?

2006
02:28:20,054 --> 02:28:22,941
Hello! Hey mister.
Hello!

2007
02:28:23,366 --> 02:28:25,275
His leg's hurting him.

2008
02:28:25,711 --> 02:28:28,041
Force him to come forward and play.

2009
02:28:29,321 --> 02:28:31,151
<i>Binny comes back into the attack.</i>

2010
02:28:31,271 --> 02:28:33,478
It's come.

2011
02:28:36,802 --> 02:28:40,116
<i>Binny bowling to Lloyd.</i>

2012
02:28:42,406 --> 02:28:46,597
<i>And he's out! The West Indian Captain
is caught by the Indian Captain.</i>

2013
02:28:46,798 --> 02:28:47,798
<i>Big wicket!</i>

2014
02:28:47,983 --> 02:28:52,431
<i>Binny's 18th wicket, making him the
highest wicket taker of the tournament.</i>

2015
02:28:54,759 --> 02:28:56,976
Mother!

2016
02:29:02,457 --> 02:29:05,697
<i>He's gone. What a magnificent
catch by Kirmani.</i>

2017
02:29:05,817 --> 02:29:10,159
At 76 for 6, the reigning world
champions are in total disarray.

2018
02:29:15,223 --> 02:29:18,188
Now dance. Now show us your dancing.

2019
02:29:18,308 --> 02:29:20,794
Kapil's going to kill you.

2020
02:29:24,831 --> 02:29:26,855
<i>A low flat six from Dujon.</i>

2021
02:29:27,989 --> 02:29:30,537
<i>The Indians cannot
get complacent now.</i>

2022
02:29:31,150 --> 02:29:34,233
Sardar, keep the ball tight.
It mustn't go for a boundary.

2023
02:29:34,353 --> 02:29:38,216
I've set the fielding. There, there
and there. Come on.

2024
02:29:38,431 --> 02:29:40,501
Where, where and where?

2025
02:29:40,919 --> 02:29:42,441
You think this is a joke?

2026
02:29:42,561 --> 02:29:44,310
Sardar, it's the Final.
Get serious.

2027
02:29:44,768 --> 02:29:47,896
Brother, whatever you say.

2028
02:29:55,026 --> 02:29:56,700
<i>Crucial juncture in the game.</i>

2029
02:29:56,820 --> 02:30:00,423
<i>With that single,
West Indies brings up their 100.</i>

2030
02:30:04,755 --> 02:30:06,777
<i>Yashpal cannot stop that.</i>

2031
02:30:09,417 --> 02:30:11,033
Ballu!

2032
02:30:11,480 --> 02:30:16,150
<i>The required run rate is still
just over 3 runs per over.</i>

2033
02:30:16,348 --> 02:30:19,588
<i>Will Dujon save the game
for the West Indies?</i>

2034
02:30:19,708 --> 02:30:22,900
<i>The West Indies now need 65 runs
in 19 overs to win the World Cup.</i>

2035
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:23,775
Jimpa...

2036
02:30:23,895 --> 02:30:26,505
<i>India needs a crucial wicket now.</i>

2037
02:30:26,783 --> 02:30:28,987
Make Lala-ji 10 years younger today.

2038
02:30:37,413 --> 02:30:40,608
<i>Kapil turns to his
most trusted teammate.</i>

2039
02:30:42,131 --> 02:30:45,316
<i>Jimmy to Dujon. And he's bowled!</i>

2040
02:30:45,436 --> 02:30:49,731
<i>Jimmy has proven his worth
time and time again.</i>

2041
02:30:49,851 --> 02:30:53,108
Dujon is out. Amarnath has taken
a crucial wicket.

2042
02:30:53,233 --> 02:30:57,385
<i>India is now back in the game
and it's wide open.</i>

2043
02:31:05,672 --> 02:31:07,410
<i>And that's another wicket
by Amarnath.</i>

2044
02:31:07,530 --> 02:31:09,703
<i>After a fabulous performance in the
semi-finals,</i>

2045
02:31:09,823 --> 02:31:12,680
<i>Amarnath is now turning
the tide in the Final.</i>

2046
02:31:13,092 --> 02:31:15,558
Howzzat!

2047
02:31:18,896 --> 02:31:20,650
<i>Kapil Dev gets another one!</i>

2048
02:31:20,775 --> 02:31:23,847
<i>India so close to
making history now.</i>

2049
02:31:27,137 --> 02:31:28,566
What happened?

2050
02:31:28,691 --> 02:31:30,441
- What's the score?
- The score?

2051
02:31:30,561 --> 02:31:34,346
- 9 wickets down.
- Wow! 9 wickets down.

2052
02:31:38,324 --> 02:31:41,025
<i>The West Indies now 9 wickets down.</i>

2053
02:31:41,150 --> 02:31:43,132
<i>Jimmy to Holding.</i>

2054
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:47,091
Howzat!

2055
02:32:14,676 --> 02:32:16,623
Out!

2056
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:03,133
<i>Steeped in your love,
O beloved country</i>

2057
02:33:03,342 --> 02:33:07,777
<i>Every trial is effortless</i>

2058
02:33:07,897 --> 02:33:15,897
<i>Together your admirers have
conquered the sky</i>

2059
02:33:17,067 --> 02:33:21,396
<i>Steeped in your love,
O beloved country</i>

2060
02:33:21,516 --> 02:33:26,037
<i>Every task is possible</i>

2061
02:33:26,157 --> 02:33:34,157
<i>Your admirers have won over
the world.</i>

2062
02:33:34,812 --> 02:33:42,812
<i>As long as there's life
in our breath</i>

2063
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:50,681
<i>Devoted in our love for you,
O beloved country</i>

2064
02:33:51,109 --> 02:33:53,741
India has won the World Cup!

2065
02:33:54,064 --> 02:33:57,094
<i>Let our flag fly high!</i>

2066
02:33:57,214 --> 02:34:01,013
<i>Let our flag fly high!</i>

2067
02:34:45,553 --> 02:34:46,652
Kapil!

2068
02:34:47,972 --> 02:34:49,724
Kapil!

2069
02:34:49,917 --> 02:34:53,085
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
India has won the cricket World Cup.</i>

2070
02:34:58,964 --> 02:35:01,733
This shows that we can do it.

2071
02:35:01,914 --> 02:35:03,546
Brother.

2072
02:35:03,666 --> 02:35:06,841
One day, I'll play cricket
for India too.

2073
02:35:06,961 --> 02:35:09,133
Yes.

2074
02:35:10,267 --> 02:35:15,906
<i>Name and glory,
O beloved country</i>

2075
02:35:16,085 --> 02:35:22,369
<i>Points to none other than you</i>

2076
02:35:22,489 --> 02:35:29,561
<i>Wherever I go, I long for you</i>

2077
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:35,062
<i>Your name will shine for ever more</i>

2078
02:36:27,847 --> 02:36:30,868
No one slept that night.

2079
02:36:31,669 --> 02:36:35,985
People were dancing everywhere, from
the streets into the hotel lobby.

2080
02:36:36,278 --> 02:36:40,464
I can't find the words to describe
that visual.

2081
02:36:40,953 --> 02:36:45,965
People were dancing and singing
and beating drums!

2082
02:36:46,085 --> 02:36:49,415
That kind of happiness was not
something we had experienced...

2083
02:36:49,700 --> 02:36:51,632
I definitely hadn't.

2084
02:36:51,985 --> 02:36:56,058
Champagne bottles were popped
every minute as people celebrated.

2085
02:36:56,178 --> 02:37:00,062
But I was just worried about who
was going to pay for all this.

2086
02:37:00,182 --> 02:37:04,376
It was the last day of the tour,
no one had any money left.

2087
02:37:04,758 --> 02:37:08,001
I still do not know to this day
who paid for everything.

2088
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:10,639
We couldn't eat, we were so happy.

2089
02:37:10,759 --> 02:37:14,783
By the time we got hungry,
all the restaurants had closed.

2090
02:37:15,033 --> 02:37:17,039
The day we won the World Cup,

2091
02:37:17,159 --> 02:37:21,526
we slept on an empty stomach,
but with a full heart.

2092
02:37:21,646 --> 02:37:23,638
When we first got to England,

2093
02:37:23,758 --> 02:37:26,734
the famous cricket journalist,
David Frith

2094
02:37:27,046 --> 02:37:29,364
had written in an article

2095
02:37:29,587 --> 02:37:32,425
that if India won,
'he'd eat his words'.

2096
02:37:32,545 --> 02:37:35,188
Meaning he would chew up his words.

2097
02:37:35,669 --> 02:37:37,710
After we won on the 25th June, 1983,

2098
02:37:37,830 --> 02:37:40,454
there were massive celebrations.

2099
02:37:40,753 --> 02:37:43,297
I only managed to get back
to my room at 4 am.

2100
02:37:43,859 --> 02:37:48,182
As soon as I sat down
I wrote a letter to David.

2101
02:37:48,411 --> 02:37:52,757
'Mr Frith, now that we've won,
you'll have to eat your words!'

2102
02:37:53,024 --> 02:37:57,304
A month later, on 23 July
David Frith went to Lord's.

2103
02:37:57,529 --> 02:38:00,441
He had a glass of wine in his hands,

2104
02:38:00,561 --> 02:38:03,592
and he chewed up the article
he had written!

2105
02:38:03,712 --> 02:38:09,902
<i>Sitting with folded hands
achieves nothing</i>

2106
02:38:10,022 --> 02:38:15,567
<i>Go, show fate what it means
to have strength of purpose</i>

2107
02:38:15,687 --> 02:38:21,242
<i>If you are brave, my fellow country-
men God is on your side too</i>

2108
02:38:21,362 --> 02:38:26,870
<i>Go, show the world what it means
to believe in yourself</i>

2109
02:38:27,068 --> 02:38:32,612
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

2110
02:38:32,732 --> 02:38:37,692
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

2111
02:38:37,812 --> 02:38:43,416
<i>Let it fly on high</i>

2112
02:38:43,536 --> 02:38:48,908
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>

2113
02:39:11,966 --> 02:39:14,881
<i>Keep the flag flying</i>

2114
02:39:15,001 --> 02:39:17,414
<i>Proudly flying in the wind</i>

2115
02:39:17,619 --> 02:39:23,603
<i>Proudly wave your country's flag</i>
