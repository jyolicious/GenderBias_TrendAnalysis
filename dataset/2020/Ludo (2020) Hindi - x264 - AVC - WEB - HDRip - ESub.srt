1
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,625
What time is the program?

2
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:56,583
{\an8}At sharp 8:30, sir.
It will be wiped clean. Burnt to ashes.

3
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,000
{\an8}Again before time?

4
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,166
{\an8}I'm punctual, sir. Always before time.

5
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,083
{\an8}The issue with arriving before time is
there's nobody around to appreciate you.

6
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,666
{\an8}-Let's play a round of <i>Ludo.</i>
-You seem addicted to <i>Ludo.</i>

7
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm addicted to life, bro.
<i>Ludo</i> is life and life is <i>Ludo.</i>

8
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,041
And there you go again…

9
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,625
What are human beings?

10
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,416
Just different colored tokens
on the board of life.

11
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,333
And who holds the dice of their fate?

12
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,500
-Him.
-Exactly.

13
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,041
He decides which way the wind blows.

14
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,916
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

15
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,833
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

16
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,958
<i>Oh, hello, mister</i>

17
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,458
<i>There are good days and bad days</i>

18
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,208
<i>Now it's good, now it's bad</i>

19
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,875
Hello? Okay, then come upstairs.

20
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,250
Asshole. Who are you going with?

21
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,625
Sambhavi?

22
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,291
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

23
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,541
Look, Bhinder,

24
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,083
I am not killing you.
I am setting your soul free.

25
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,458
Leave this body
and be reincarnated in a new body.

26
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,333
Enjoy milk and cookies again.

27
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,666
Make a fresh start.

28
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:08,041
{\an8}<i>Oh…</i>

29
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,708
{\an8}<i>My dear</i>

30
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,791
{\an8}<i>Oh, my dear</i>

31
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,041
{\an8}<i>Oh, hello, mister</i>

32
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,166
{\an8}<i>There are good days and bad days</i>

33
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,583
{\an8}<i>Now it's good, now it's bad</i>

34
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,666
{\an8}<i>Good and bad, good and bad</i>

35
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,666
{\an8}<i>Oh, my dear</i>

36
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,583
{\an8}Sing, guys.

37
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,291
{\an8}<i>There are good days and bad days</i>

38
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,500
{\an8}<i>Now it's good, now it's bad</i>

39
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,458
{\an8}<i>Good and bad, good and bad</i>

40
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,666
{\an8}<i>Oh, my dear</i>

41
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,083
{\an8}Hey, this is our house.

42
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,833
{\an8}Where are you taking him?

43
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,583
{\an8}-What are you doing?
-When will you return the money?

44
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,291
-Move.
-Hey! You've forgotten, but I haven't.

45
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,708
I'm a bit hard up.
I'll pay you in a week or two.

46
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,666
Well, do you have a choice?

47
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,833
-Put him in the car.
-Please, don't.

48
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,291
Give him a good seat. Hello, Asha.

49
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,666
I heard Bittu got out of jail and met you.

50
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,125
{\an8}Tell him that I miss him a lot.

51
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:06,250
{\an8}He must come see me. For old gold days.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,416
{\an8}Bye. Hey, come on. Let's go.

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,833
{\an8}Asha, don't worry.

54
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:15,041
{\an8}<i>The world is a circus</i>
<i>Filled with many wonders</i>

55
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,541
{\an8}<i>One struggles to get a bite of food</i>

56
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,250
{\an8}<i>While others overindulge</i>

57
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,458
{\an8}<i>Yes, while others overindulge</i>

58
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,875
{\an8}<i>Oh, my dear</i>

59
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:27,041
{\an8}<i>The brew of life can be hot or cold</i>

60
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,416
{\an8}<i>Now it's hot</i>
<i>Now it's cold</i>

61
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,833
{\an8}<i>Hot and cold</i>
<i>Hot and cold</i>

62
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,125
{\an8}<i>Oh, my dear</i>

63
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,041
{\an8}<i>Oh, hello, mister</i>

64
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,833
{\an8}<i>There are good days and bad days</i>

65
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,916
{\an8}<i>Now it's good, now it's bad</i>

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,125
{\an8}<i>Good and bad, good and bad</i>

67
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,875
{\an8}<i>Oh, my dear</i>

68
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,125
I fail to understand how <i>karma </i>works, sir.

69
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,875
Poor Bhinder got murdered
for a handful of diamonds.

70
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:03,291
And this murderer, dacoit, don,
is leading a royal life.

71
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:06,375
Please explain this to me, sir.
In a few words.

72
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,583
What is this game of sin and virtue?

73
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:12,416
Okay, tell me this.
Many lives were lost because of Corona.

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,208
Do you think they were all sinners?

75
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,083
-I don't think so, sir.
-So?

76
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:20,208
You want a straight answer
for a tricky question?

77
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,083
There goes my yellow token.

78
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,375
Who is this guy?

79
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,500
Him? His kind is very rare nowadays.

80
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,000
What do you mean?

81
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:55,375
It's like sending a love letter
hidden in a book, in the era of Tinder.

82
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,041
Hi, guys. So, I'm Akash

83
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,291
and this is Aks, my alter ego.

84
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,083
Not alter, falter ego.

85
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,541
Basically, when
he's scared to say something,

86
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,916
he makes me say it.

87
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,666
He is the government
and I am his puppet, the media.

88
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,541
The nation wants to know!

89
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,333
The nation wants to…

90
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,333
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

91
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,875
-Where are you from?
-New Zealand.

92
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,583
The land of the Jersey cow!

93
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,500
In their country, a cow only gives milk.

94
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,291
But in our country, besides milk,

95
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,333
it gives votes, too.

96
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,916
<i>Life is going to screw you anyway.</i>

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,583
<i>Whether you want to be screwed</i>
<i>with a grin or with a scowl is up to you.</i>

98
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,583
<i>And if grinning is an art,</i>
<i>then this guy is a true artist.</i>

99
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,250
I could not conceive,

100
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,666
then my friend suggested Apple Slippers.

101
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,125
And see the results,
two kids in nine months.

102
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,541
Twins.

103
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,208
Thank you, Apple Slippers.

104
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,291
What are you waiting for?

105
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:13,208
Set the remote aside, pick up your phone,
and order Apple Slippers.

106
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,708
Go on.

107
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,125
Dude, who buys these items?

108
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,583
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay.

109
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,041
Dude, if you are done…

110
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,541
Okay, I'm taking a break, too.

111
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,416
Should I show it to him?

112
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,916
<i>-I love you! Come on!</i>
-Show him. It's a hard piece…

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,375
-with background music.
<i>-I'm coming.</i>

114
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,750
<i>No way! You're gonna wait for me!</i>

115
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,708
<i>-Come fast!</i>
-Which website is this?

116
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,333
Why do you need the website?
I will WhatsApp it.

117
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,791
<i>-I'm coming!</i>
-Send it to me.

118
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,125
<i>Wait a second, my phone.</i>

119
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,500
<i>Hello. Yes, Mom. Yeah, I'm at the temple.</i>

120
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,958
-Brother, I want to talk to you.
-Go on.

121
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,208
No, in private.

122
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,458
Well, there's no crowd here.

123
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,583
Please, brother, it's personal.

124
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,250
She is your sister-in-law.
What's so personal?

125
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,333
Actually, I want to…

126
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,500
show you something.

127
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,666
Is this you?

128
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,791
<i>-I love you! Come on!</i>
-Yes.

129
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,875
<i>-Yeah, I'm coming!</i>
-Can't see your face here.

130
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,958
-The scar on my butt.
<i>-No way! You're gonna wait for me!</i>

131
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,291
This one, on the butt?

132
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,666
Yes, where you'd hit me
with a belt when we were little.

133
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,166
Thank God, you are straight.

134
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:21,750
Well, you only hang out with boys.

135
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,291
We were worried that you are gay.
My wife was really worried about you.

136
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,166
Since when
have you been… into horse-riding?

137
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,291
Sir, it's been about five or six months.

138
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,875
What a horse!

139
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,958
Really, Mr. Sinha?

140
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,541
It's really no big deal nowadays.

141
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,791
-Oh, my…
-Sir…

142
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,041
What?

143
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,000
No, it's good. You are doing good.

144
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,875
Next time, just turn off the lights. Okay?

145
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,375
-You can go.
-Sir, please register the FIR.

146
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,541
Why are you asking for trouble?
Is your face visible?

147
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,375
It isn't. Only the girl is seen.

148
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,750
She's getting married in five days.

149
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,333
Look, the views are skyrocketing.
It was 13,000 last evening.

150
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,083
Now, it's touching one lakh.

151
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,833
It will ruin her life
if it comes to light.

152
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,583
Well, that's her problem, right?

153
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,416
You're a lawyer.
You know the law. Explain it to him.

154
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,583
FIR can't be registered
unless the girl comes here.

155
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,500
Got it? Okay, goodbye.

156
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:48,291
<i>Now the moment's gone</i>

157
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:53,375
<i>Could not make my feelings known</i>

158
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:59,625
<i>God's will be done</i>

159
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:05,916
<i>I forsake your memory</i>

160
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
<i>And carry on</i>

161
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:13,833
<i>I left behind my oldest love</i>

162
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:20,833
<i>I forget your reflection and carry on</i>

163
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,291
<i>I left behind my oldest love</i>

164
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,125
-Hi.
-Hi.

165
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,500
When's the wedding?

166
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,500
In five days.

167
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,083
Italy. Destination wedding.
All of us are going.

168
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,458
So, did you get what you wanted?

169
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,958
Yes. In fact, much more than that.

170
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,916
Have you heard of R.K. Jalani?

171
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,458
That's his son, Shekhar. My fiancé.

172
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,666
Holy Incense Sticks.
Temples all over India use them.

173
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,958
They have a turnover
of 20,000 crore rupees.

174
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,833
He's so nice, so sweet.

175
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,000
He visits
Vaishno Devi Temple twice a year.

176
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,500
-Does he visit porn sites?
-What?

177
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,166
No! No…

178
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,125
Shruti.

179
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,125
-Yes.
-Let's go.

180
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,833
I'm coming. Give me two minutes.

181
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:31,416
Actually, I wanted to show you something.
Can we go somewhere else?

182
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,250
Show me. You can show it here.

183
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,250
Please use earphones.

184
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,750
<i>I'm coming!</i>

185
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,125
<i>No way! You're gonna wait for me!</i>

186
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,708
-Shruti!
-Yeah?

187
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,250
-Shruti!
-Yeah!

188
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,791
You asshole!

189
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:21,708
Found out about my wedding
on Facebook and decided to blackmail me?

190
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,750
I didn't upload it.

191
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,416
My face is not seen in the clip either.

192
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,375
Exactly!

193
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,791
Your face isn't visible but mine is!

194
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,291
How long have you been planning this?

195
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,625
I haven't planned anything.
I am here to help you.

196
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:43,083
The police won't register
the complaint unless you go there.

197
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,583
You are here to help me!

198
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,000
You are here to help me?

199
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,625
Name your price! Come on.

200
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,416
Just 320 rupees, for the taxi ride.

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,541
Congratulations on your wedding.

202
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,625
And here's your phone.

203
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,333
Where have you brought me?

204
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,500
The epicenter of local crime.

205
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,083
Sattu <i>bhaiya's</i> den.

206
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,041
Only he can solve your problem.

207
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,666
Where police
and administration's jurisdiction ends,

208
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,375
his jurisdiction begins.

209
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,333
There have been
six murder attempts on him.

210
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,375
Bullets, grenades,
cannons, nothing worked.

211
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,416
I don't know what kind of deal
he has with the God of Death,

212
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,750
but he just doesn't die.

213
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:59,458
<i>Every game has a token</i>
<i>which may be worthless to itself</i>

214
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,000
<i>but helps others succeed.</i>

215
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,500
Oh, my God!

216
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,083
Oh, charming man,

217
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,541
I am in love with you.

218
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,166
You are my Romeo,

219
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,541
and I am your Juliet.

220
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,875
Oh, made-in-China Juliet,

221
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,333
I will put an end to your gall.

222
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,000
You won't be able to show your face again,

223
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,666
for I will cut your nose once and for all!

224
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,500
Brother!

225
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,375
You motherfucker!

226
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,583
Patwari, you fool.
You really cut my nose.

227
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,125
The scene demanded it.

228
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,041
You're being overly realistic.

229
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,000
How dare he hit me!

230
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,041
<i>Alok Kumar Gupta, aka Aalu.</i>

231
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,083
<i>Be it a snack or a main course,</i>
<i>potato is always a part of it.</i>

232
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,916
<i>In the same way,</i>
<i>this man fits into every role.</i>

233
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,958
<i>He was a small-time fraudster.</i>

234
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:18,958
<i>Now he runs a small diner</i>
<i>with those same goons.</i>

235
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,666
Items delicious as pie.
If in a hurry, goodbye.

236
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,708
We have it all. Punjabi, Italian,
Bengali, Thai, or Mexican.

237
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,333
Lentils that are heavenly,
chickpeas that are tangy.

238
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,541
Cheese kebabs, curry, stir fry.
Chicken kebabs, curry, stir fry.

239
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,375
Lollipop, Szechuan, 65, Manchurian.

240
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,041
All kinds of Indian breads,
salad and pickle free.

241
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,833
Hyderabadi, Lucknowi,
Mumbai, and Delhi-style biryani.

242
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,875
Falooda, carrot pudding for dessert.

243
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,875
Pepsi, Cola, soda, juice,
or enjoy a sorbet and let loose!

244
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,458
Today's special, Amrish curry,
Aishwarya pie, Juhi Chawla chow mein.

245
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,291
Mithun special. <i>Jallaad</i> Jellyroll,
<i>Gunda</i> Granita, <i>Maa Kasam</i> muffins.

246
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,666
-Any doubt?
<i>-He has only two weaknesses.</i>

247
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,416
<i>One is Mithun. The other?</i>

248
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,666
<i>Pinky. The one-sided love in Aalu's life.</i>

249
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,125
<i>You are my blockbuster hit</i>

250
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,166
<i>My heart is a picture hall</i>

251
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,250
<i>Pinky, you are mine</i>

252
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,750
<i>You are my The End, too</i>

253
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,666
-Aalu!
-Yes?

254
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,416
-Rahul teased me.
-He teased you?

255
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,916
<i>Some people are destined to be used.</i>

256
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,875
<i>Not because they are stupid.</i>

257
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,666
<i>Yes, sir, some people</i>
<i>just want to get fucked in love.</i>

258
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,833
<i>The one who inspired Aalu to leave crime</i>

259
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:52,750
<i>left to start a new life.</i>

260
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:57,166
<i>Three years ago, Aalu's Pinky</i>
<i>became Mrs. Pinky Manohar Jain.</i>

261
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,666
<i>But even today,</i>
<i>Aalu's day is not complete…</i>

262
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,875
<i>unless he catches a glimpse of Pinky.</i>

263
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,250
Mannu.

264
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,833
-Mannu, what is your password?
-Why? What happened?

265
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,166
-I need to make a call.
-Use your own phone.

266
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,250
I'm running late. Give it to me.

267
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,958
-What's the secret?
-There's no secret between us.

268
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:29,333
My friends created a WhatsApp group,
and they send obscene videos.

269
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,458
You want to see that? I think not.
What's this fuss about?

270
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,208
He stays cooped up in the bathroom
with his phone for half an hour.

271
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,416
The PM's security is nothing
compared to his phone's.

272
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,125
Move aside, please.

273
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,041
WhatsApp to Facebook, everything's locked.

274
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,333
Really?

275
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,500
He used to use talcum powder,
but now he uses perfume.

276
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,875
Do you know how he used to enjoy sweets?

277
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,125
Now, he has green tea
with a sugar substitute.

278
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:58,333
I'm not trying to rile you,
but I think he is having an affair.

279
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,041
-What now?
-Believe me.

280
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,666
Keep an eye on him. Follow him.

281
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,583
In such a case,
it's a wife's right to doubt her husband.

282
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,833
And it is right, too.

283
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,458
-You look handsome today.
-Yes.

284
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,166
Where are you going?

285
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,875
Where do I go every week?
To Bhinder's place.

286
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,041
-Shouldn't I?
-No, no. Tell his wife I said hello.

287
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:17,958
Okay.

288
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,041
Listen, lock the door.

289
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,958
Okay, darling? Bye-bye.

290
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,000
-Here. Take him.
-Hurry up.

291
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,125
<i>Oh, hello, mister</i>

292
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,333
<i>There are good days…</i>

293
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,916
-Hello?
<i>-Hello.</i>

294
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,166
Bro, I have parked my car at your place.
You are my alibi.

295
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,333
Listen, if Pinky calls you,
tell her that I am with you.

296
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,583
Okay?

297
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,666
I am off to enjoy my life.

298
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,750
Sambhavi?

299
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,916
Sattu <i>bhai.</i>

300
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,541
He's a lawyer.

301
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,458
Take a seat.

302
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,333
<i>Bhaiyaji,</i> Bittu is on his way.

303
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,416
And there goes my red token.

304
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,875
<i>-He seems furious.</i>
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

305
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,666
<i>Red is the color of blood.</i>

306
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,333
<i>And that of love.</i>

307
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,375
<i>Batukeshwar Tiwari.</i>

308
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,083
<i>Aka Bittu </i>bhaiya.

309
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,541
<i>He served six years in jail.</i>

310
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,791
<i>What was his crime?</i>

311
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,041
<i>He was Sattu</i> bhaiya's <i>right-hand man.</i>

312
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,666
<i>-His job was to clean up after him.</i>
<i>-And then?</i>

313
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,375
{\an8}<i>Then? Then he fell in love.</i>

314
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,416
{\an8}WEDDING - BITTU WEDS ASHA
SATTU BHAIYA

315
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,125
{\an8}<i>He bid goodbye</i>
<i>to crime and criminal</i>

316
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,875
<i>and moved into his little world.</i>

317
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,333
<i>And, obviously, Sattu </i>bhaiya
<i>was not very happy about it.</i>

318
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,791
<i>But as they say,</i>

319
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,875
<i>past sins and past love</i>
<i>often catch up with you.</i>

320
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,791
<i>-And when they do, they mess you up.</i>
-Bittu!

321
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,333
<i>You may want to quit,</i>
<i>but crime won't let you go.</i>

322
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,083
<i>Section 307, attempt to murder.</i>

323
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,916
<i>And Bittu went behind bars</i>
<i>for six long years.</i>

324
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,500
Where is Ruhi?

325
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,375
Where is Ruhi?

326
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,458
Hey, Sana, shampoo…
Put your hand under it.

327
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,916
Shampoo is not in this.
I'll get it tomorrow.

328
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,708
There is a comb missing.
Go and get one later.

329
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,291
This is for Ruhi.

330
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,458
Ruhi is at school.

331
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:53,625
-I'll come back in the evening.
-Bittu, she's… in a hostel.

332
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,208
She…

333
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,666
doesn't know about you.

334
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,375
She…

335
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,416
thinks…

336
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,000
Bhanu is her dad.

337
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:16,250
I thought you will never come back.

338
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,000
So, for a few days, I sent--

339
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,125
Hey, Bittu!

340
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:28,375
-Bittu, no! Listen to me! Look…
-Bittu!

341
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,333
What are you doing? Let him go!

342
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No!

343
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,875
<i>Some people are lonely.</i>

344
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,041
<i>With no one to call their own, sir.</i>

345
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:09,208
<i>And then there are some</i>
<i>who are lonely amidst their own.</i>

346
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:15,041
<i>Mini's parents are always busy.</i>

347
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:19,291
<i>Sometimes parents get so busy</i>
<i>securing their child's future,</i>

348
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,416
<i>they ignore their present.</i>

349
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:26,291
<i>And to get their attention,</i>
<i>the child can go to any extent.</i>

350
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:27,500
<i>What do you mean?</i>

351
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:28,625
<i>Wait and watch, sir,</i>

352
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,958
<i>to what extent Mini goes.</i>

353
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,916
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

354
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,166
<i>-This is a kidnapping case.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

355
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,208
<i>-I think your daughter has been kidnapped.</i>
<i>-Please save my daughter.</i>

356
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:47,333
<i>-Please, sir, save our daughter.</i>
<i>-Only you can save my daughter.</i>

357
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,833
<i>My daughter…</i>

358
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:58,875
Break the glass.

359
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
-Why are you destroying my shop?
-Take him away.

360
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,833
Where are you taking him?

361
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,375
Hello, Asha.

362
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,750
I heard Bittu got out of jail and met you.

363
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,625
Tell him that I miss him a lot.
He must come see me.

364
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:14,291
Bye. Hey, come on. Let's go.

365
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,791
Asha, don't worry.

366
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,125
They…

367
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,958
took away Bhanu.

368
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,541
Go complain to the police.

369
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:38,875
You are the cause for all of this, Bittu.

370
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,541
Sattu is using us to get back at you.

371
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:45,666
We had taken a loan of 50 lakhs.
Now, somehow with interest, it's 90 lakhs.

372
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,458
Today, they forcibly took Bhanu away.

373
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:50,166
What was his fault?

374
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,375
He did what he did for his family,

375
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:55,541
for our parlor,
and for Ruhi's boarding school fees.

376
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:58,583
Today, they took away Bhanu. If…

377
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:02,666
If they kidnap Ruhi someday,
only then you'll be happy.

378
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,666
I don't know why I married you.
I curse myself for it.

379
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,000
Make sure Bittu
isn't carrying any weapons.

380
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,958
-Hello, sir.
-Come on, have a seat.

381
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,708
Who the fuck is going to make the tea?

382
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,791
Who? Should I?

383
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:49,833
Move!

384
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,166
<i>Rahul Avasthi.</i>

385
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:06,958
<i>An average, ordinary young man</i>
<i>from a small town.</i>

386
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,041
<i>And unless you change</i>
<i>from ordinary to extraordinary,</i>

387
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:12,416
<i>society is not worried about you.</i>

388
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,416
<i>You can lead a peaceful life</i>
<i>being a part of the crowd.</i>

389
00:30:18,375 --> 00:30:19,625
You dumbfuck!

390
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:23,541
Who do you think you are?

391
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,166
Straight to work?
Thought I wouldn't notice.

392
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,791
Sir, the train was late.
There was a protest going on.

393
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,375
Train? What about
the room you rent here?

394
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:36,791
Sir, they threw me out
because three months' rent was due.

395
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,708
-Do I look stupid to you?
-No, sir.

396
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,083
You useless bum.

397
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,958
-Move aside, please.
-Yes, sorry.

398
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,291
What are you staring at?

399
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,166
You want to hit me?
You want to hit me? Hit me!

400
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,916
-Come on. Hit me.
-Sorry, sir.

401
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,625
If you are ever late again…

402
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,791
Focus on your work.

403
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:07,625
<i>Sheeja Thomas. She is from Kerala.</i>

404
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,500
<i>Can barely speak</i>
<i>a word of Hindi or English.</i>

405
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,708
<i>So in this new city,</i>
<i>she often finds herself lonely.</i>

406
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,125
<i>She takes a break</i>
<i>from her world every evening</i>

407
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,500
<i>and loses herself</i>
<i>in the lights of the mall.</i>

408
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,875
<i>Her dreams are big, but pockets are empty.</i>

409
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,041
<i>Aspirations.</i>

410
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,041
<i>Even if you get a one</i>
<i>each time you roll the dice,</i>

411
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:31,583
<i>you won't quit the game.</i>
<i>The game must go on, right?</i>

412
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:32,958
<i>-Exactly.</i>
-End the call.

413
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:36,416
I warned you not to use
the hospital phone for personal calls.

414
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,833
-There's no balance--
-So should I recharge it?

415
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:41,791
Hey, listen. What's your sun sign?

416
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,333
-Sun…
-Date of birth!

417
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,833
November 30, 1990.

418
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,000
So you are a Sagittarian.

419
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,125
Hey, Sheeja, can you say this?

420
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,833
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

421
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,375
-Come on.
-Peter…

422
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:04,458
What's going on here?
Started troubling her again?

423
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:06,291
And my magazine, give it to me!

424
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:08,666
What about
the stool samples from number 12?

425
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,875
Sheeja, come.

426
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,375
Screaming won't ease your pain.

427
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,458
Are you a Sagittarian?

428
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,625
You will meet someone.

429
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,000
He will light up your life.

430
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,708
He will cover you…

431
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,416
with showers of love.

432
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:39,500
He will bring a balance into your life.

433
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,041
Why can't you believe?

434
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,166
What the fuck, asshole? Is this your home?

435
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,541
-Get the hell out of here.
-Shit…

436
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:00,500
I'll castrate you
if I ever see you here again. Out!

437
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,458
…tell her that I am with you. Okay?

438
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,708
I am off to enjoy my life.

439
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:37,000
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

440
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,875
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

441
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:42,125
<i>Oh, hello, mister</i>

442
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,833
<i>There are good days and bad days</i>

443
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,875
<i>Now it's good, now it's bad</i>

444
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,916
<i>Good and bad, good and bad</i>

445
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,625
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

446
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:56,208
<i>There are good days and bad days</i>
<i>Now it's good…</i>

447
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,291
Sir…

448
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:02,750
Rahul.

449
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,208
Rahul.

450
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,583
Have you had breakfast?

451
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,958
Want to eat something?

452
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,708
Would you eat a bullet?

453
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,208
-Sir--
-Come on.

454
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,166
-Come on. Put him in the car.
-Sir.

455
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,875
-Make room for him.
-Please, sir.

456
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,416
What are you looking at?
Go and make that tea.

457
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,166
Make two more videos like this,

458
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,791
and you'll become
this city's tourist attraction.

459
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:58,333
Who says our city is backward?
Look at this.

460
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,125
He's a voice artist.

461
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,625
I love artists.

462
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,291
Sir, please solve our problem.

463
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,875
Tell me your problem in Amitabh's voice.

464
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,333
Sir, his <i>Deewaar</i> impersonation
or <i>Baghban?</i>

465
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,750
<i>Deewaar.</i>

466
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,583
-You--
-Stand up.

467
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,791
You must be happy today.

468
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,125
The man who never
bowed his head in front of anyone

469
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:41,458
is asking you today
to delete this clip from the internet.

470
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:47,208
Fantastic! You murdered it, bro. Bravo!

471
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:52,000
Tell me something. Did you go towards
Bhilai, Dhamtari, with this madam?

472
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,458
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, this hotel is from that area.

473
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,958
Mark Zuckerberg Mishra.

474
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,125
Hey, Mishra!

475
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,125
Boss is calling you. Come.

476
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,166
What are you doing here?
Come with me.

477
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,583
He handles my IT department.

478
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:18,625
He will get it off the internet
and help you nab that guy, too. Okay?

479
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,083
Bye.

480
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:24,750
And listen.

481
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,666
Next time do it with better lighting.

482
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,166
At least we will get to see your faces.

483
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,791
How will you find this number?
Can you nab him?

484
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,458
Go on your horse. Don't walk.

485
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,708
We'll get it, but I'll have to trace it.

486
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,375
What did you see there?

487
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,458
The dead body fell. Then you came.

488
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,500
I'll pry your eyes out.

489
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,416
Think it over.
I'll ask you again in five minutes.

490
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,333
It's been a while, Bittu. Give me a hug.

491
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:20,416
-Let him go.
-No, I won't let him go.

492
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,083
In fact, I will sell his kidney.
The deal's fixed for 12 lakhs.

493
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:27,416
You are still a sly son of a bitch.

494
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Look, Bittu, you are my weakness,

495
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:34,041
your weakness is your wife and daughter,
and he is their new weakness.

496
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,125
So, he's my trump card.

497
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:40,958
Listen, come back and join me.
We will mint money together.

498
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:44,000
You will earn in millions
and I'll earn in billions.

499
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:48,083
Take his kidney. I don't give a shit.

500
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,291
-Hey, Bittu!
-Wait!

501
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,541
You do give a shit.

502
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,875
And till you and your family give a shit,

503
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,875
I will keep pestering you.

504
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,541
Go on.

505
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,375
You know what I do
to the ones who walk away.

506
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,708
And listen,
I forgot to tell you something.

507
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:15,666
Your six years in jail was thanks
to a tip I shared with the police.

508
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,291
Now you know the level.

509
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:26,916
Let's get started.

510
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,291
-Take his kidney out.
-So, assholes?

511
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,875
-Who's making the tea?
-Let me go, Sattu <i>bhaiya.</i>

512
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,750
-Bittu, help me. Bittu!
-Go.

513
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,083
It's time, sir.

514
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:45,208
Bittu! Help me, Bittu!

515
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,583
Bittu, they will kill me.

516
00:38:48,166 --> 00:38:52,375
Bittu, help me. Bittu!

517
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:20,625
Two down.

518
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:22,625
-Three.
-Look over there.

519
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,125
Yes, it's five now.

520
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,750
And now, it's nine.

521
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:31,083
-What's the total?
-Nine.

522
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,416
-Nine?
-Yes.

523
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>The police has been tracking</i>

524
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,583
<i>this notorious gang for a while now.</i>

525
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,000
<i>According to reports,</i>

526
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,708
nine were killed
and 17 injured in this explosion.

527
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,250
<i>…that though the state borders</i>
<i>have been sealed,</i>

528
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,625
<i>Sattu</i> bhaiya <i>is a dreaded</i>

529
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,708
<i>As you can see,</i>

530
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,500
we're in front of
Sattu <i>bhaiya's</i> alleged den.

531
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,791
Ranchi police
had been keeping an eye on them…

532
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:16,125
Can you help, please? Hold it.

533
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:20,875
<i>Explosives and weapons</i>
<i>were stored here in a large numbers.</i>

534

536
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,541
-Give me a cup of hot water.
-Okay. Anything else?

537
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,583
-Papa.
-Yes, darling?

538
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:34,750
Remove one matchstick
to convert two triangles into four.

539
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,583
From this?

540
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:39,083
Sir, please check the spam folder.

541
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:45,500
-Yes. Trust me.
-I came here as Mini's governess.

542
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:47,666
Now I have to
clean this dog's shit too.

543
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,208
It's not easy to handle Chiku.

544
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,041
-We have to do something.
-He bit me.

545
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:53,791
You are lying. You hit Chiku.

546
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:57,458
What's this fuss about?
He's been vaccinated. Everyone is safe.

547
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,833
Listen to me, madam.
You have to choose between me and Chiku.

548
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,916
Please decide.

549
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,000
Let me go! Chiku won't go anywhere!

550
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:19,250
Chiku won't go anywhere!
No! Let me go!

551
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:22,083
Chiku won't go anywhere!

552
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,000
-Is Manohar Jain at home?
-Yes, sir.

553
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,208
Sir, what happened?

554
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,625
-I underwent a surgery recently.
-Come on.

555
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,625
-Liar!
-Where are you taking him? Mannu!

556
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:40,958
Let him at least put on some clothes.
Mannu!

557
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,916
Please let him go.

558
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,250
Mannu!

559
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:49,500
Madam, please come.
Sir, this is Manohar Jain's wife.

560
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,750
The MG Road case.

561
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,791
That's her.

562
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,916
Sir, why did you arrest Mannu?

563
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,041
Relax. Please sit, ma'am.

564
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,625
-Why did you arrest Mannu?
-Don't worry.

565
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,500
We just have some questions for you.

566
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,458
Where was your husband last night?

567
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,958
Sir, he was at his friend's place.

568
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:15,541
-Friend? Which friend?
-Mr. Bhinder. He's a builder.

569
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,750
-Confirm?
-Yes. In fact, I saw him go there, sir.

570
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:21,041
-Were you with him?
-Sir, what happened?

571
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,583
-Why did you arrest him?
-Were you at Bhinder's house?

572
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:25,916
I did go there.

573
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:30,500
I was not with him,
but I saw him there, sir.

574
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:35,333
I thought he is having an affair.
So I followed him.

575
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:38,125
But I was wrong, sir.
He's not having an affair.

576
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,625
-He's a good man.
-He's charged with double murder.

577
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,833
Bhinder and his wife's murder.

578
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:46,875
We already have
the CCTV footage and call details.

579
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,250
Your statement confirmed it.

580
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,375
Case closed.

581
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,875
-Thank you.
-No…

582
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,125
Ganesh, what's the status on Sattu?

583
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,250
His ambulance
never reached the hospital.

584
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,125
-Sir!
-What? Wait a minute.

585
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:03,666
-Want to get us all fired? Find him.
-Yes, sir.

586
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,125
Sir, there's been some misunderstanding.

587
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,416
My husband can never
do something like this.

588
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,041
He can. Your gut feeling
was 100% right, madam.

589
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,458
He's a bloody criminal-minded man.

590
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:16,166
No, sir.

591
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,666
-Hey…
-Sir, please, let me meet him just once.

592
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,041
-Ganesh.
-Yes, sir.

593
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:26,541
Come here.

594
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:28,791
-Take her to him.
-Please come.

595
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:29,958
What's the charge?

596
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,333
Charge is that
you were released yesterday,

597
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:33,875
and today this blast happened.

598
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:38,500
And the most important point is
your rift with Sattu is known to all.

599
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:45,958
Then arrest me.

600
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,791
I will. I will arrest you
if I find the evidence.

601
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,875
Till then, do not leave
the city without my permission.

602
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,000
Got it? You can leave now.

603
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:59,333
-Pinky!
-Mannu!

604
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,250
-Mannu!
-Pavan, keep an eye on her.

605
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,833
What's going on?
They're charging you with murder.

606
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,833
-Is Bhinder dead?
-Dead or not, he fucked me up.

607
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,750
-Fucked you up?
-Listen.

608
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,208
Go and meet Mr. Chaube.
He's a criminal lawyer.

609
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,666
Tell him what happened.
Ask him to save me. Okay?

610
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,416
Note down this name. Your phone?
Note down this name.

611
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,333
S-A-M-B-H-I.

612
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:22,083
Sambhavi. I was
with this girl last night, darling.

613
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:25,708
I'm having an affair. I was with her.
She lives at Supela Junction.

614
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,375
-She runs a women's welfare organization.
-Time to go.

615
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,625
-She loves me. Get her statement.
-Come on.

616
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,375
-Talk to her.
-Come on.

617
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,208
Sambhavi!

618
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,125
Help me.

619
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:45,416
My full name, Rahul Satyendra Tripathi.

620
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:49,791
Your name is Rahul,
that's why I spared you.

621
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,500
You do good,

622
00:46:52,041 --> 00:46:53,125
good do you.

623
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:44,541
No.

624
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,416
-It's a plain face--
-Look at it carefully.

625
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:51,125
-I said no.
-I won't tell anyone. Please look again.

626
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:55,500
You are weird. I'm being respectful
and you are giving me attitude.

627
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:59,166
I'm not giving you attitude. I know
you were with my husband last night.

628
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,125
Look, come along
and give your statement to the police.

629
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:03,541
Leave respectfully before--

630
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:06,375
Women like you
should not talk about respect.

631
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:08,083
Get out of here. Go!

632
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:11,500
-How dare you touch me?
-Bitch!

633
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,458
How dare you touch me?
Aren't you ashamed?

634
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,583
…doughnut, mother of meringue,
what would you like?

635
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,375
-Grilled chicken.
-Grilled chicken.

636
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,708
Bachkaane, clean table number three.

637
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:31,541
Get the check for table number five…

638
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,333
He…

639
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,458
What is his name?

640
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,041
Babu.

641
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,125
Babu.

642
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,333
What…

643
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:23,666
brings you here?

644
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,750
I always knew it.

645
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:35,291
One who doesn't wash his hands
after peeing can never be a good man.

646
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,625
Did you ask him, "Where did I fall short?"

647
00:49:41,041 --> 00:49:41,916
You?

648
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,708
-You.
-Me?

649
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,166
Yes, did you ask him,
"Where did I fall short?" I mean, you.

650
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,166
Where did I fall short?

651
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,125
Exactly. You are the best.

652
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:58,416
Listen.

653
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:01,583
Leave him.

654
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,041
How can I leave him?

655
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,833
He is my husband.

656
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,500
He's Babu's daddy.

657
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,125
How can I leave him?

658
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,625
I hate porn.

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,500
I'm glad they banned it.

660
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,291
What ban?

661
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,166
My phone is full of it.

662
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,291
I love porn.

663
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,708
They work so hard.

664
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:41,875
And if you start the clip midway,
you can still get the story.

665
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,666
-But there is a practical problem, dude.
-What?

666
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,541
Porn sets wrong expectations.

667
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:52,541
People start having false expectations.

668
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:53,916
-Nonsense.
-Hey…

669
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,791
Look, Johnny and Mia keep it going
nonstop for two hours in the clip.

670
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:01,833
But our Mr. Gupta here,
he is done in two minutes flat.

671
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,625
But no kidding, bro,
it has ruined many lives.

672
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:11,666
I had a friend, Chandan.

673
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:15,791
In school, when asked what
your goal in life is, what do you say?

674
00:51:15,875 --> 00:51:17,625
Doctor, engineer.

675
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,666
Yes! But do you know what Chandu said?

676
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,875
"I want to be a pizza delivery boy."

677
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:26,875
In the hope that while delivering pizza,
one day some chick might say,

678
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,666
"I am so lonely, Chandu."

679
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,708
"Would you like to share my cheese burst?"

680
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,375
Hey, move your hand!

681
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,958
Hey, looks like my bro can relate to it.

682
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,791
My boy, don't go down that path.

683
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:47,583
His idea is better. He visits
matrimonial websites for blind dates.

684
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,583
Can't you keep a secret?

685
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:50,625
Tell them.

686
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,083
But it's been three years.

687
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:54,750
But it's still fresh in my mind.

688
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:58,833
So, he met a girl
on a matrimonial website.

689
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,250
The girl asked him to wait

690
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:03,791
at so-and-so coffee shop
with a packet of so-and-so chips.

691
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,666
But I forgot to ask her

692
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,583
if I should only hold it
or if I am allowed to eat a few, too.

693
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,625
And then she came.

694
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:16,583
<i>She looked exactly the way</i>

695
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,791
<i>the groom's family always imagines…</i>

696
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:20,833
<i>their future daughter-in-law.</i>

697
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,666
-Hi.
-Hi.

698
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:24,625
You are…

699
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:26,875
not photogenic at all.

700
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,208
I mean, you look better in person.

701
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,083
Thanks.

702
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,500
-Shruti Choksi.
-Akash Chauhan.

703
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:39,166
Dr. Akash Chauhan, right?
What kind of doctor are you?

704
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,333
I have a doctorate in Arts.

705
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:44,208
I did my PhD in
Mongolian Art in Mughal Architecture.

706
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:47,750
But don't judge me,
I failed three times in school.

707
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:53,166
-Ma'am, order please.
-Yeah.

708
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,500
One cappuccino…

709
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,500
and a cucumber sandwich.

710
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,875
And you?

711
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:05,708
Do you have ginger tea?

712
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,750
-Sure.
-I'll have that.

713
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:11,791
What brings you here? You are from Bhilai.

714
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:15,791
I am here
for six months on an internship.

715
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,333
-Okay.
-So on weekends…

716
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:19,416
-You meet prospective grooms?
-Yes.

717
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,625
And…

718
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:26,208
-what do you do?
-I'm actually a sales executive.

719
00:53:26,291 --> 00:53:28,375
-Where?
-Kaamdhenu Electronics.

720
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:30,833
Hope you don't mind,

721
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,291
but what's you annual CTC?

722
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:40,500
Well, I can't save much,
but I don't need to take loans either.

723
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:44,583
And your family?

724
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:48,791
<i>An expert interviewer can gauge</i>
<i>a candidate's worth within five minutes.</i>

725
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,791
<i>I mean, the girl wanted a Ferrari</i>

726
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,583
<i>and I was just a nobody.</i>

727
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:54,583
<i>And she understood that well</i>

728
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:59,458
<i>by the time we crossed the road</i>
<i>to go to the bar from the cafe.</i>

729
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:02,833
<i>After two drinks, Jagjit Singh</i>
<i>had transformed into Honey Singh.</i>

730
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,166
His teeth were like this.

731
00:54:05,083 --> 00:54:06,083
Yuck!

732
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,041
Bunny teeth!

733
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:10,666
Bunny!

734
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,041
The uncles dance at the parties.

735
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,583
You are straight, aren't you?

736
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,333
What do you mean?

737
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:22,750
Straight? Like, I'm as straight as…

738
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:25,500
I'm as straight as this.

739
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,166
I don't know.

740
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,875
I just know that I lose interest easily.

741
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:42,458
So I keep trying different things.

742
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:46,750
Like, now I am studying
to be a ventriloquist.

743
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:47,791
"Ventro" what?

744
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:52,291
Congratulations, the girl is with you
in your pad on the first date.

745
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:56,458
Reading glasses, curly hair. I like her.

746
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:58,916
Even I like her.

747
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:03,541
I'm sure she's not here
at this hour to play <i>Ludo</i> with you.

748
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:06,375
So, loser, who will make the first move?

749
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:10,333
What do you mean? I don't know
who will make the first move.

750
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:13,125
With you, it's always,
"I don't know." All right then.

751
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,833
-I don't know--
-Shut up!

752
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:18,500
It's not your cup of tea.

753
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,750
She's coming. She's come.

754
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:23,875
Should I look away?

755
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:37,416
<i>Either destroy me</i>

756
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,458
<i>Or light up my world</i>

757
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:45,791
<i>Either destroy me</i>

758
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:49,916
<i>Even if you are not Juliet</i>

759
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,041
<i>Let me be your Romeo</i>

760
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:57,375
<i>Just do me a favor</i>

761
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,875
Can I ask you something?

762
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:04,000
There were two other guys at the café
with chips packets.

763
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:06,041
Did you call them there?

764
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:08,875
Yeah.

765
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:14,000
You looked richer than them.

766
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:16,416
Imagine.

767
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:18,958
Looks can be deceptive.

768
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,125
You are fun when you're drunk.

769
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:27,041
I know.

770
00:56:28,166 --> 00:56:30,333
Yes, I have an elder brother.

771
00:56:32,625 --> 00:56:36,166
I hope you don't mind,
but what is your annual CTC?

772
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,833
<i>Just do me a favor</i>

773
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:44,041
<i>Fulfill this desire of mine</i>

774
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:48,833
<i>That was wrong, this is right</i>

775
00:56:48,916 --> 00:56:51,958
<i>Let me believe this lie</i>

776
00:56:52,791 --> 00:56:57,041
<i>Every breath of mine</i>

777
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:00,083
<i>Is yours now, just say it</i>

778
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:04,166
<i>Make it easy for me</i>

779
00:57:06,916 --> 00:57:10,750
<i>Make it easy for me</i>

780
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:13,083
<i>Either destroy me</i>

781
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:20,416
<i>Either destroy me</i>

782
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:23,458
Was it this guy?

783
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,041
Two died, one missing.

784
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,750
You safe, how?

785
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:29,666
That man…

786
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,583
Rubbish!

787
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,625
<i>I will drink this</i>

788
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:49,000
<i>Sweet poison for you</i>

789
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,916
<i>You may not be God</i>

790
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,125
<i>But I'll keep worshipping you</i>

791
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:07,916
<i>I will drink this</i>

792
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,208
<i>Sweet poison for you</i>

793
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,000
<i>You may not be God</i>

794
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:20,583
<i>But I'll keep worshipping you</i>

795
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:24,375
<i>I want to live with my head held high</i>

796
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:27,916
<i>Take my life if you want to</i>

797
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,875
Bye.

798
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:32,500
<i>Why live like a caged bird?</i>

799
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:36,250
<i>Set me free now</i>

800
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:39,666
<i>Do me this favor</i>

801
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:50,541
<i>Make it easy for me</i>

802
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:54,458
<i>Either destroy me</i>

803
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:58,375
<i>Or light up my world</i>

804
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:03,333
<i>Either destroy me</i>

805
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,333
Chiku.

806
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,041
Chiku.

807
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,125
Chiku.

808
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,000
Chiku.

809
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:01,333
Chiku.

810
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,250
Chiku.

811
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:29,833
Chiku.

812
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,250
Chiku.

813
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:01,208
-What is your name?
-Mini.

814
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,041
And you are?

815
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:06,291
Bittu.

816
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:11,291
Should we go get Chiku?

817
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,125
Where are your parents?

818
01:02:17,208 --> 01:02:20,166
Some goons came home and beat up Papa.

819
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,166
Here is the note. Our maid found it.

820
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,083
YOUR DAUGHTER IS WITH US. DON'T GO
TO THE COPS IF YOU WANT HER ALIVE.

821
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:28,041
<i>Mummy was crying for help,</i>
<i>so they took her away in a black van.</i>

822
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:30,875
I hid under the bed.

823
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,625
And I am very brave.

824
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:37,000
So I jumped out of the window.

825
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,208
How did you get hurt?

826
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:50,375
It's nothing.

827
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,083
Look, I got hurt, too.

828
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,750
Should we bandage it?

829
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,250
Who is this?

830
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:19,791
My daughter.

831
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,416
Where is she?

832
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,416
-In a hostel.
-Oh, my!

833
01:03:24,916 --> 01:03:28,375
She's just a baby
and you sent her to a hostel?

834
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,416
It's an old photograph.

835
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,541
Now she must be just like you.

836
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:38,750
Which class are you in?

837
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:40,708
2B.

838
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:42,375
She, too.

839
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,208
Don't you have her recent photos?

840
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:50,041
Are you very busy, as well?

841
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:53,875
Then why did you send her to a hostel?

842
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,375
Where is her mom?

843
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,375
HOLY INCENSE STICKS

844
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,666
His floating Taj Mahal
has turned to ashes.

845
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,666
So much for acting so high-and-mighty.

846
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,750
Sattu <i>bhaiya's </i>orphans
are on the streets now.

847
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,041
Happy Diwali,<i> bhaiya.</i>

848
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:13,250
Hey, hey…

849
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:26,166
I want to go home.

850
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,541
I want to go home quickly.

851
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:32,125
But aren't there goons at home?

852
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:35,083
Sorry, I was lying.

853
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:49,916
Look, even if you bring the CM along,
my answer will remain the same.

854
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,125
-I don't know her husband.
-Really? Show it to her.

855
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,041
Here.

856
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,375
And what about the 1,700 calls

857
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:00,875
you made to her husband
in the last two months?

858
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:04,000
-We have the records.
-And what does it prove?

859
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:08,208
If you continue to harass me,
I'll call the police.

860
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:12,583
You call the police and we'll tell
your husband about it. What then?

861
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:15,750
When your husband gets to know
that his darling wife, Sambhavi,

862
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:19,833
is having an affair with Pinky's husband,
maybe then you'll give your statement.

863
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:33,875
-Mr. Kamal Nath? Hello.
-Hello.

864
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:35,333
She will give her statement.

865
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,833
It'll cost you 20 lakhs.

866
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:43,416
-To give the statement?
-To save her husband.

867
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:45,541
Then ask for 40 lakhs.

868
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,375
Forty. Let's finalize the deal at 40.

869
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:53,375
-Done. See you.
-Forty…

870
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:57,166
<i>This society is disrespecting women.</i>

871
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:01,500
Here's one who cheats on his lovely wife
to have an affair with a witch.

872
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,750
And the witch's husband
is pimping her out.

873
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:05,916
What do I say?

874
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,333
-Good women or bad, no one is safe.
-What will we do now?

875
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,708
What can we do?

876
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:13,625
Your father organized a lavish wedding

877
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:16,500
and got you married
to this rich, respectful guy.

878
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:19,125
-Am sure he can manage 40 lakhs.
-Four…

879
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:23,125
-Four…
-Why couldn't he think of me?

880
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,333
Now?

881
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:29,458
Even kingdoms have been destroyed
for women, and he's merely a manager.

882
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,375
What will become of Babu now?

883
01:08:31,458 --> 01:08:33,875
He'll have to grow up as an orphan.

884
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:39,166
No! I'm with you.
He won't be orphaned. I…

885
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,208
I'll take care of him, Pinky.
I'm Aalu, after all. I…

886
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:46,541
I'll take care of everything.
Nothing is impossible for me. Come on.

887
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:48,500
Just don't cry in front of me.

888
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:56,291
After that, "I, Shruti Choksi,

889
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:59,708
had sex with my boyfriend, Akash Chauhan,

890
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:04,125
in an unknown hotel room."

891
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,958
When you enter the hotel room,

892
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:13,375
this device will immediately alert you
to the cameras' exact locations.

893
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:15,875
Please call me when you find them.

894
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,041
-Won't you come with us?
-What will I do there?

895
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:22,458
One second. What do you mean by,
"What will I do there?"

896
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:25,875
It just means, what will I do there?

897
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:31,500
I am getting married in four days,
and I am not here to visit hotels.

898
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:34,250
We won't do this. It's your duty.

899
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,791
Duty! Are you going
to teach me my duty?

900
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:40,666
There were blasts in the city!
Nine people are dead!

901
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:43,500
Two corpses with missing heads.
Three with missing limbs!

902
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:47,625
We still can't identify the gender
of two corpses.

903
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,750
Sattu is still missing!

904
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:53,375
A girl has been kidnapped,
and a builder has been murdered!

905
01:09:53,458 --> 01:09:57,791
And, ma'am, my darling wife says,
"Divorce me before you go!"

906
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,916
And I am-- What is it?

907
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:10,875
Hello?

908
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,916
Yes, one minute.

909
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,291
Where's the girl's room?

910
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:15,458
Did you search the entire house?

911
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,708
Any threatening phone calls?

912
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:21,541
We found some newspaper bits.
Letters were cut out of it for the note.

913
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,625
Sir, this way.

914
01:11:25,041 --> 01:11:27,666
Here. Only those letters
have been cut out.

915
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:30,875
-What is this?
-We don't know.

916
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:35,208
-Who comes in this house?
-Sir, besides us, it's only--

917
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,083
Only our maid. That's all.

918
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:40,125
-Maid, driver, gardener, call them all.
-Come on.

919
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,791
How will I pay you
if I don't have a business?

920
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:48,750
What's the use of violence?
I did tell Sattu <i>bhaiya…</i>

921
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,625
Listen to me… Hey! Spare my shop…

922
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,041
It's her old certificate.

923
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,666
We got her admitted
in Saint Thomas last year.

924
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:25,375
You can go meet her.

925
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,000
Tell her, "I am your father."

926
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,625
"I am a criminal."

927
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,708
"I went to jail when you were little."

928
01:12:32,791 --> 01:12:34,375
"I might go again."

929
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:36,458
"Any day."

930
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,291
You are confused.

931
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:48,416
You are confused between ego and love.

932
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,625
Your ego is hurt
that Ruhi is away from you now.

933
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,041
Bittu, this is not love.

934
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:59,250
If you loved her,
you would help us out of this problem.

935
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,583
When we were together,
I lived in fear. Now…

936
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:04,791
Once again…

937
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:09,041
I can't do it anymore.

938
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:36,791
Hello.

939
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,416
-Is that Bittu?
-Yes.

940
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,250
Bittu.

941
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,791
I'm in trouble.

942
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,333
They have taken over my parlor.

943
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,750
And if I don't pay them back
on time, they will kill me.

944
01:14:00,833 --> 01:14:03,333
It's final. Please help me.

945
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:12,250
Please help me, I will…

946
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:15,666
I will go away from Asha and Ruhi.

947
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:19,583
With interest,
I have to pay them 90 lakhs.

948
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:38,291
Asshole, you missed work yesterday
and decided to turn up today?

949
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,250
You thought I wouldn't know.

950
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,458
Do I look stupid?

951
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,875
No, sir, I met with an accident…

952
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,000
Accident?

953
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,000
Does it hurt?

954
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:55,208
What are you staring at?
You want to hit me? Then hit me.

955
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:56,916
Hit me.

956
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:59,791
Hit me. Hit me.

957
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:12,958
Hey, where were you all this time?

958
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,416
Sheeja, say, "Peter Piper picked--"

959
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,958
Peter, fuck you.

960
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,000
Bittu.

961
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,208
{\an8}MISSING - MINI SHRIVASTAV
PRIZE MONEY 50,000

962
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:52,416
I need a place to hide.

963
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Why?

964
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:58,125
The police is looking for me.

965
01:16:15,291 --> 01:16:17,458
-What's his pulse?
-70, sir.

966
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:20,958
-Okay, and blood pressure.
-151…

967
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:24,916
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

968
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,291
<i>Oh, my dear</i>

969
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,166
<i>Oh, hello, mister</i>

970
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,000
<i>There are good days and bad days</i>
<i>Now it's good…</i>

971
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:35,875
Was he with you in the ambulance?

972
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:40,583
It's a strange case.

973
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,666
The accident happened on the road,

974
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,750
the ambulance
was found on the railway tracks,

975
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:48,208
and we found him on the river bank.

976
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:59,541
Mr. Sattu, you escaped death once again.
Amazing.

977
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:03,416
Hello?

978
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,666
Bittu is with that girl?

979
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,875
I am coming soon.

980
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:07,875
<i>Oh, dear</i>

981
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,916
<i>Oh, dear</i>

982
01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:15,500
<i>You're the wind</i>
<i>You're a tigress</i>

983
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:18,791
<i>You're the wind</i>
<i>You're a tigress</i>

984
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:22,625
<i>You're the wind</i>
<i>You're a tigress, oh, dear</i>

985
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,833
<i>You're the wind</i>
<i>You're a tigress, oh, dear</i>

986
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:29,083
<i>You're the wind</i>
<i>You're a tigress, oh, dear</i>

987
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:32,291
<i>You go, oh, dear</i>

988
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:35,458
<i>You go, girl</i>
<i>Oh, dear</i>

989
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,333
<i>You're the wind</i>
<i>You're a tigress</i>

990
01:17:38,458 --> 01:17:41,208
-Greetings.
-Greetings, Sattu <i>bhaiya.</i>

991
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:10,041
He wants to write something. Pen.

992
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:19,125
-Paper.
-Paper.

993
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,000
There. It's there.

994
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:29,416
Why are so many people here? Go outside.

995
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,041
-We are going to the temple, Sattu <i>bhaiya.</i>
-Come on.

996
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,958
To pray for you. You will be fine, <i>bhaiya.</i>

997
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,500
Why doesn't this asshole die?

998
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:42,458
<i>Water, air, fire,</i>
<i>nothing works on this guy.</i>

999
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:45,083
<i>He will die this time.</i>
<i>Just wait and watch.</i>

1000
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:46,666
<i>How much money was in that bag?</i>

1001
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:49,291
Maybe one, one and a half crores.

1002
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,916
-Where's ma'am?
-She must be around. Check.

1003
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:57,041
-Madam, give me some medicine, too.
-What's going on?

1004
01:18:57,125 --> 01:19:00,291
-What's wrong with you guys? Out!
-My heart is going crazy.

1005
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:02,666
{\an8}-Give me an injection.
-Punks!

1006
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,583
Stop, please.

1007
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:21,875
-Why are the police looking for you?
-Because I have been kidnapped.

1008
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,291
Who kidnapped you?

1009
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:30,208
-The police suspect me.
-Why do they suspect you?

1010
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:34,791
Because the police think
that I wrote that kidnapper's letter.

1011
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,500
Who wrote it?

1012
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,166
I did.

1013
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,791
<i>I think your daughter has been kidnapped.</i>

1014
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,291
<i>Please save my daughter.</i>

1015
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:46,416
<i>-Please, sir, save our daughter.</i>
<i>-Only you can save…</i>

1016
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:02,541
Why?

1017
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,666
To make Mumma and Papa cry.

1018
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:09,666
And once I go back home,
they will never leave me alone.

1019
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,416
So what next?

1020
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,708
What else? I'll have to go to jail.

1021
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:29,583
I have an idea.

1022
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:33,500
You can get out of trouble.

1023
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:38,750
We will call them
and say that I kidnapped you.

1024
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,125
Yes, you look like a goon, too.

1025
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:01,500
Hey, open the door.

1026
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:04,083
<i>Lady luck's not on your side</i>

1027
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,291
<i>But you always take it in stride</i>

1028
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:12,000
<i>True love's a total no-go</i>

1029
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:13,916
Search the house.

1030
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,750
<i>And life's become a bad game of Ludo</i>

1031
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:19,291
<i>Loyalty, that's a screen of smoke</i>

1032
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:23,041
<i>You break your piggy bank</i>
<i>But you're still broke</i>

1033
01:21:24,458 --> 01:21:27,083
<i>Everything around you is in shambles</i>

1034
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:31,041
<i>And life's become a bad game of Ludo</i>

1035
01:21:48,041 --> 01:21:48,875
Come on.

1036
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:51,208
Come fast!

1037
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:16,166
Are you sure there's no CCTV there?

1038
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,791
Costumes! Two stars or three?

1039
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,833
-See what suits you.
-Three stars!

1040
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:21,791
-Like Salman's <i>Dabangg.</i>
-Check the guns.

1041
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:23,833
I hope we won't land in trouble.

1042
01:22:23,916 --> 01:22:26,291
All you can do is whine, eat, and shit.

1043
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:29,416
His brother-in-law said
there are three officers

1044
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,416
and a lot of corruption money… How much?

1045
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,625
-Seven lakhs.
-That's all we need. And it's easy.

1046
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:38,041
Make an entry in style in our uniforms,
catch them with the girl,

1047
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,666
and ask them to pay up.

1048
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,500
-It's Murphy's Law.
-What's wrong?

1049
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:44,916
-Rosy got married.
-Oh, man! Okay, check with Kamala.

1050
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Can Kamala really wear this?
What are you talking about?

1051
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,291
What did you tell him?

1052
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:05,000
Mom and Dad had a fight.

1053
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:08,208
They are thinking of a divorce.
I'm going to settle it.

1054
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:10,291
What if he calls your mom and dad?

1055
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
He won't.

1056
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:15,375
And even if he does,
my mom knows everything.

1057
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:17,750
-She'll handle it.
-Everything?

1058
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,875
Listen, my phone is ringing.

1059
01:23:23,333 --> 01:23:24,375
Yes, baby?

1060
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:28,458
No, it's all messed up here.

1061
01:23:28,541 --> 01:23:32,125
They are just not ready to listen.
They are fighting like kids.

1062
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:35,875
-It's hopeless.
-Only complaints for the last 30 years.

1063
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:38,041
I am sick of you.

1064
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:41,375
So? I told my family
not to call you for my funeral.

1065
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:45,208
-Wait a second. Hold.
-All right. You're not invited to mine.

1066
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:48,000
-I mean…
-I'll marry someone else tomorrow.

1067
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:52,041
-Oh, God!
-Who will marry you? You are useless now.

1068
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,125
This is too much. It's below the belt.

1069
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:58,583
Listen, I think they are fighting again.
Don't call me, I'll call you. Okay?

1070
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,208
Okay, bye.

1071
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,833
Thank you.

1072
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:13,416
So where are we going?

1073
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,500
Sunshine.

1074
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:21,083
See, I told you. I remember.

1075
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:23,416
Red and white building.

1076
01:24:26,916 --> 01:24:28,625
And the bed was tilted, too.

1077
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:36,458
<i>My eyes have sworn, my love</i>

1078
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,500
<i>They will only dream of you</i>

1079
01:24:41,583 --> 01:24:43,583
<i>Always, every day</i>

1080
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:47,625
<i>Every moment, every night</i>
<i>Forever, my love</i>

1081
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:54,666
<i>My eyes have sworn, my love</i>

1082
01:24:55,958 --> 01:25:00,333
<i>They will only dream of you</i>

1083
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:06,541
<i>Always, every day, every moment</i>
<i>Every night, forever, my love</i>

1084
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:11,250
<i>My eyes have…</i>

1085
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,666
Why would Shekhar be here?

1086
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:17,083
No, Mummy. No!

1087
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,708
How can I come, Mumma? I can't!

1088
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,666
No, I'm having fun here.

1089
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,875
I'm really having fun here.
Why are you taking his calls?

1090
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:29,416
I have gone on three dates
with that guy from Hyderabad,

1091
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,458
but I haven't seen him smile yet.

1092
01:25:32,708 --> 01:25:34,791
I mean, he never smiles.

1093
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:39,750
Now I have one last hope.
That guy from Delhi.

1094
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:41,958
Your timing is perfect.

1095
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,541
Every time, right after sex,
your dating audition results pour in.

1096
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:49,458
So I don't get serious about us?

1097
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:52,916
Smart boy.

1098
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:55,833
What if I do?

1099
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:59,416
Why should you? Isn't it going well?

1100
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,958
That's what I am saying. It's going well.

1101
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,000
What's the problem?

1102
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,333
There's no problem.

1103
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:11,541
It's just that you… You know…

1104
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:12,875
That I am not rich?

1105
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:16,000
The problem is not that
you are not rich today.

1106
01:26:16,083 --> 01:26:18,125
The problem is you will never be rich.

1107
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,750
Good point.

1108
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:22,666
But, actually, I agree.

1109
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,541
It's difficult to be happy with less,

1110
01:26:25,541 --> 01:26:27,166
but it's impossible with too much.

1111
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:32,958
This… This is the problem.
Your attitude is wrong.

1112
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:38,916
The attitude is right, madam,
but the times are not.

1113
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:56,416
Nothing.

1114
01:26:58,833 --> 01:26:59,833
Let's go.

1115
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:03,958
You don't have to do it.
If you're not comfortable, just say so.

1116
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:07,208
My wrong could be your right
and your right could be my wrong.

1117
01:27:07,291 --> 01:27:10,666
But, you see,
there is a whore in every woman

1118
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:12,291
and a good woman in every whore.

1119
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:15,833
-So just focus on the whore in you--
-What are you blabbering about?

1120
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:19,875
It's just acting, Pinky.

1121
01:27:22,666 --> 01:27:26,083
<i>How do I tell you</i>

1122
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:30,166
<i>How much I love you?</i>

1123
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:34,291
<i>Even if I see your shadow</i>

1124
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:38,416
<i>I'd kiss it right away</i>

1125
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:43,125
<i>When I meet you</i>

1126
01:27:43,208 --> 01:27:47,166
<i>My heart prays to Him</i>

1127
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:51,416
<i>May this day never end</i>

1128
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,541
<i>May the sun never set</i>

1129
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:58,875
<i>I just want to be with you</i>

1130
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:03,500
<i>Just be with you</i>

1131
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:07,875
<i>I will hold you close</i>

1132
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:14,000
<i>Always, every moment, every day</i>
<i>Every night, forever, my love</i>

1133
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:19,083
<i>My eyes have…</i>

1134
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,541
-Where is Sheeja? Did she call?
-No, ma'am.

1135
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:21,500
-I have been calling her--
-Bed number four is an asshole.

1136
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:25,083
-He doesn't listen. Please handle him.
-Why? What happened?

1137
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,833
He says, "There's a fly on your nose."

1138
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:29,833
"Swat it away or I'll shoot you."

1139
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:31,083
Why are you laughing?

1140
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:35,416
Hello. How are you today?
How are you feeling?

1141
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:48,833
You can say whatever you like,
I don't care. I'm quite thick-skinned.

1142
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:52,500
Take this off.
There is no need for it now.

1143
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:54,000
I want a cigarette.

1144
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:57,833
If you have a cigarette,
smoke will come out of your stiches.

1145
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:03,000
Just take off these doodads.
Take them off.

1146
01:30:03,083 --> 01:30:04,750
It's these doodads…

1147
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:08,750
that are keeping you alive.
If not for them, you'd have died.

1148
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:13,750
Then let me die.
Who cares if I live or die?

1149
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:16,875
I want to fucking leave.

1150
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,416
Shut the fuck up! I care.

1151
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,666
We're working day and night
to keep you alive.

1152
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,875
If you want to die, do it outside.
I won't let you die here.

1153
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:33,875
Sorry.

1154
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:36,708
I was a little loud.

1155
01:30:37,708 --> 01:30:38,875
I am sorry, too.

1156
01:30:39,625 --> 01:30:41,541
I was foul-mouthed.

1157
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:49,875
You have been wetting
the bed for two days. Pee in this now.

1158
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:51,916
No. Don't you dare. I'll shoot you.

1159
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,291
-Don't!
-You call me Mom.

1160
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:55,166
Why should you be embarrassed?

1161
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:00,416
Do it.

1162
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:10,916
A little more.

1163
01:31:12,125 --> 01:31:13,375
Yes, do it.

1164
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:17,583
-Are you done?
-Yes.

1165
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,041
Hey!

1166
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:27,125
I'll make so many holes…

1167
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:30,125
I'll make so many holes…

1168
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:31,875
Wait a minute!

1169
01:31:31,958 --> 01:31:35,291
I'll make so many holes,
you'd look like a water filter. Slap him.

1170
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:37,166
How dare you do this in my city?

1171
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,458
Let's go to the police station.

1172
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:43,583
Unless you
want to settle it under the table.

1173
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:46,750
You…

1174
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:49,833
How dare you touch her? How dare you?

1175
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:53,083
-You look innocent but act like a rascal.
-Don't touch me.

1176
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:56,708
-Drop the gun.
-You drop it.

1177
01:31:56,791 --> 01:32:03,541
-You do it!
-You do it!

1178
01:32:03,625 --> 01:32:06,416
-You do it!
-You do it!

1179
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,500
Who is it?

1180
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:11,541
-You do it!
-You do it!

1181
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:11,125
Let's go!

1182
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:22,333
696,000. 698,000.

1183
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:25,375
-Seven lakhs.
-Hey, it's just seven lakhs.

1184
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:30,208
-How much did you say?
-Seven lakhs.

1185
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,125
You mean, 60?

1186
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:35,041
I mean, seven. Seven.

1187
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:36,625
But you had said 60.

1188
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:39,666
Not 60, I said 7. And it is 7 lakhs.

1189
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:42,375
Your tobacco-filled mouth
turned 60 into 7.

1190
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,250
Bro, I had said seven! Total…

1191
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:48,750
-Wait a second. Where are you going?
-I'm leaving.

1192
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,375
Everything is a mess now.

1193
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:53,375
It's your oversmartness
that messed it all up.

1194
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:58,041
No, not my oversmartness.
My stupidity messed up my life.

1195
01:33:58,125 --> 01:33:59,458
Did I ask you to do it?

1196
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:02,166
Of course not!
It's my husband who's in jail.

1197
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:05,458
-I came to you for help.
-You could have said no.

1198
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:10,541
Both of us know very well
that I can't say no to you.

1199
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:12,416
Have I ever since childhood?

1200
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:16,166
When your 12th grade exams were going on,

1201
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:19,625
I was hanging from the third floor,
dictating the answers word-to-word.

1202
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:22,250
I failed the exam,
but I helped you clear it.

1203
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:26,208
I love Amitabh Bachchan,
but I dress up like Mithun for you.

1204
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:30,041
I've been rattling off
his dialogues forever.

1205
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:33,666
I know people call me
second-hand Mithun and laugh at me.

1206
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,041
But I don't care.

1207
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:37,625
Because you like Mithun.

1208
01:34:38,375 --> 01:34:40,083
You never spoke like this before.

1209
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:42,500
Because I have never been so fucked up.

1210
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:47,416
No one dared
to look at you in a wrong way.

1211
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,000
I made sure no one did.

1212
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,500
When your grandma had piles,

1213
01:34:53,583 --> 01:34:56,291
who went to Haridwar
to get her medicine? I did.

1214
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:59,583
I see.
So it wasn't friendship, just favors.

1215
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:01,416
I'm not counting favors.

1216
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:04,083
You don't talk about friendship.

1217
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:07,666
You didn't even call me once
after getting married.

1218
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:10,375
That's the problem with you.
You are an emotional fool.

1219
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:15,125
-You don't think logically.
-You are right. I am an emotional fool.

1220
01:35:15,208 --> 01:35:19,791
You shot them, you killed them,
and who is standing by you?

1221
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:21,708
Emotional fool.

1222
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:26,708
I will do it again.
I will bring your husband out.

1223
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:30,166
I have some savings.
I'll give it to you.

1224
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:32,166
Go and bail him out.

1225
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:34,875
And how do I matter?

1226
01:35:35,666 --> 01:35:39,166
I am happy running my diner. Right?

1227
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:42,666
But I hope you are happy, Pinky.

1228
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,916
I will give you everything I have.

1229
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,333
Thank you.

1230
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:54,291
Anil Shrivastav?

1231
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,208
Your daughter is with me.

1232
01:35:57,291 --> 01:36:01,666
-If you want to see her--
-Papa, help me! Help me!

1233
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:06,500
I hope you heard that.

1234
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:09,041
Now listen to me.

1235
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:13,166
If you try to go to the police,

1236
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:14,791
-I'll--
-Cut her hands off.

1237
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:18,041
-I'll cut her hands off--
-Break her legs.

1238
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:19,958
-Break her legs--
-Pry her eyes out.

1239
01:36:20,041 --> 01:36:21,041
Pry…

1240
01:36:23,541 --> 01:36:26,125
And I'll send them home.
Did you get that?

1241
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:28,291
Ask for 100,000 lakhs.

1242
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:34,583
If you want to see her alive,
arrange for 90 lakh rupees.

1243
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:36,708
-When and where--
-Show a little anger.

1244
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:42,291
I will tell you the drop point and time.

1245
01:36:44,708 --> 01:36:46,875
This is your first kidnapping?

1246
01:36:57,041 --> 01:36:58,041
Hello?

1247
01:36:58,125 --> 01:37:01,750
I am arranging the money.
It will take two days.

1248
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,833
Bring Ruhi back from the hostel.

1249
01:37:39,041 --> 01:37:42,375
Nurse, administer the medicine
to the patient on bed nine.

1250
01:37:56,666 --> 01:38:00,125
Nurse, this machine
is not working. Please check.

1251
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:06,708
Move your hand.

1252
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:08,541
Just move your hand.

1253
01:39:34,958 --> 01:39:37,750
<i>When I met you, my lonely life</i>

1254
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:40,250
<i>Has come alive again</i>

1255
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:43,125
<i>You are mine</i>

1256
01:39:43,833 --> 01:39:46,541
<i>You were lost and I wondered</i>

1257
01:39:46,625 --> 01:39:48,958
<i>Why did it happen?</i>

1258
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,916
<i>You are mine</i>

1259
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:55,708
<i>I found hope</i>

1260
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:58,625
<i>Where I never expected it to be</i>

1261
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:01,625
<i>What was never mine</i>

1262
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:04,166
<i>Is what my heart seeks now</i>

1263
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:07,125
<i>How the story has changed!</i>

1264
01:40:21,916 --> 01:40:25,291
<i>You are mine</i>

1265
01:40:27,458 --> 01:40:30,541
<i>A new melody is in the air</i>

1266
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:33,458
<i>Like spring is in the air</i>

1267
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:39,333
<i>How did my dream come true?</i>

1268
01:40:39,416 --> 01:40:42,291
<i>I'm falling for you</i>

1269
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:44,625
<i>Just for you</i>

1270
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,041
<i>You are mine</i>

1271
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:53,916
<i>My heart is reaching out to you</i>

1272
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,250
<i>You are mine…</i>

1273
01:40:56,333 --> 01:40:58,333
True love is when you'll die for it.

1274
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:01,708
I know that she loves me, too.

1275
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,291
But she can't say it.

1276
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:09,041
It's my fault.

1277
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:12,625
How can she say it to a criminal…

1278
01:41:12,708 --> 01:41:15,791
Especially a girl with two dimples,
how can she say…

1279
01:41:16,375 --> 01:41:17,458
"I love you."

1280
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:27,875
Once her husband is out,
she won't even look at me.

1281
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:28,958
I know it well.

1282
01:41:30,041 --> 01:41:31,416
But I'll still help her.

1283
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,500
Thank you.

1284
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:35,208
I'll destroy myself for her.

1285
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:40,250
Because, my friend…

1286
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:44,041
some relationships
don't have any logic.

1287
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,291
They only have magic.

1288
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:50,666
Magic.

1289
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,291
<i>You are mine</i>

1290
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,708
It's 1,853,000 rupees.

1291
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:03,750
I'll pay the rest after your statement.

1292
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:08,666
-Shall we go?
-Like this? In my nightie?

1293
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:10,291
To the police station.

1294
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:11,583
You want to change.

1295
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:16,958
She will change and come back.

1296
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:22,416
Sambhu! Where are you going?

1297
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:25,208
But my treatment is going on.

1298
01:42:25,291 --> 01:42:27,125
What's going on here? What's the fuss?

1299
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:30,916
Hey… Wait up, Sambhu.

1300
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:37,875
My money!

1301
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:40,041
Hey, stop.

1302
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:45,666
Hey, stop! Hey, my money!

1303
01:42:49,375 --> 01:42:52,125
Hey, stop! Stop! My money!

1304
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:15,833
Enough!

1305
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:20,375
I have done more than enough.
I can't do it anymore.

1306
01:43:20,458 --> 01:43:21,833
Rickshaw. Stop.

1307
01:43:21,916 --> 01:43:23,625
Drop her at home.

1308
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:27,041
This is all I have now.
I'm giving you this as well.

1309
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:28,666
Babu…

1310
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:31,500
Go on.

1311
01:43:44,666 --> 01:43:48,625
Pinky! Pinky, wait!

1312
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,916
-Hello?
-Where are you?

1313
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,708
-Who is it?
-Your big daddy.

1314
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:56,875
Sattu <i>bhaiya,</i> hello.

1315
01:43:56,958 --> 01:44:00,250
What are the updates?
Where are they? Found them yet?

1316
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:02,416
That's what we are doing. Get them!

1317
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,666
-Get them!
-Follow them!

1318
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:06,791
-Get them!
-Don't let them get away!

1319
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:08,583
Throw them on the ground…

1320
01:44:09,666 --> 01:44:11,791
Hello?

1321
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:20,291
When luck suck, everyone fuck.

1322
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:27,458
When luck suck, everyone…

1323
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:30,375
Fuck.

1324
01:44:48,416 --> 01:44:49,916
Look, who is here.

1325
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:52,750
Hey, get that asshole!

1326
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:04,541
Hey, stop!

1327
01:45:10,916 --> 01:45:12,541
Get them.

1328
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,916
-Stop! Get them!
-Get in. Come on.

1329
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Ma'am, please help us out.

1330
01:45:36,083 --> 01:45:37,958
Go quickly. Go quickly.

1331
01:45:38,041 --> 01:45:40,000
Go quickly or else they will kill us.

1332
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,916
Please save me. Let's go. Go quickly.

1333
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,375
-Go quickly.
-Start the car.

1334
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,125
Hey, stop!

1335
01:46:24,166 --> 01:46:25,541
This car…

1336
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:28,708
Who the fuck
is going to fix this car? Stop!

1337
01:46:28,791 --> 01:46:29,666
Stop!

1338
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:33,833
Hey, stop.

1339
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:05,208
Darling! My wife is here.

1340
01:47:05,291 --> 01:47:07,416
Darling, they beat me up.

1341
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,000
Did you meet Sambhavi?

1342
01:47:09,083 --> 01:47:11,541
Please go and meet her. They will kill me.

1343
01:47:11,625 --> 01:47:14,000
Look how they have beaten him up.
He's badly hurt.

1344
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:17,791
He won't get bail.
I can give it to you in writing.

1345
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:21,875
-There must be some way. Anything at all?
-I wish there was some way.

1346
01:47:21,958 --> 01:47:23,958
Some big names
are involved in this, ma'am.

1347
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:26,166
The law is helpless here.

1348
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:30,375
Maybe he can break out of jail.
That's the only way.

1349
01:47:37,958 --> 01:47:39,375
I need a small favor.

1350
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:42,791
Tell me.

1351
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,708
Who else could I have gone to?

1352
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:47,708
Tell me.

1353
01:47:48,458 --> 01:47:51,333
I want you
to help Babu's daddy escape from jail.

1354
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:53,791
Jail…

1355
01:47:59,916 --> 01:48:00,916
All right.

1356
01:48:12,916 --> 01:48:13,916
Thank you.

1357
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:22,916
Purnia Express. Coach number S7.

1358
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:26,208

<i>Weaving delicate dreams</i>
<i>My weaver heart</i>

1360
01:48:34,833 --> 01:48:36,208
<i>Oh, my weaver heart</i>

1361
01:48:39,125 --> 01:48:42,250
<i>Tearing apart and stitching together</i>
<i>My weaver heart</i>

1362
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:44,458
<i>Oh, my weaver heart</i>

1363
01:48:44,541 --> 01:48:46,583
<i>Weaving a scarf of honor</i>

1364
01:48:46,666 --> 01:48:49,083
<i>Or a muffler of hatred</i>

1365
01:48:49,166 --> 01:48:52,291
<i>Or it weaves a stole of love</i>

1366
01:48:52,375 --> 01:48:56,541
<i>Sometimes a duvet of love</i>
<i>Or a sweater of gloom</i>

1367
01:48:56,625 --> 01:48:59,708
<i>Weaving delicate dreams</i>
<i>My weaver heart</i>

1368
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:02,833
Pandey, listen.

1369
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:06,458
Call this guy from Holy Incense Sticks.

1370
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:11,833
Big room! TV, fridge, AC.

1374
01:49:23,958 --> 01:49:25,500
-Thank you.
-No!

1375
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:33,958
<i>The music of love is in the air</i>

1376
01:49:34,041 --> 01:49:37,916
<i>It has blown me away</i>

1377
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,083
<i>Everything seems…</i>

1378
01:49:39,166 --> 01:49:40,125
Come here.

1379
01:49:40,208 --> 01:49:42,333
<i>So colorful</i>

1380
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:46,875
<i>In this colorless world</i>

1381
01:49:46,958 --> 01:49:51,416
<i>Giddy at times or blooming away</i>
<i>A happy twirl or it may lose it all</i>

1382
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,916
<i>Sometimes my heart dances</i>
<i>Like no one is watching</i>

1383
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:59,875
<i>Silky at times or like muslin</i>
<i>Prickly cotton or it may be velvety</i>

1384
01:49:59,958 --> 01:50:02,541
<i>Weaving delicate dreams</i>
<i>My weaver heart</i>

1385
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:23,750
Wow!

1386
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,791
You are self-obsessed, right?

1387
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:29,875
Me? Really? How?

1388
01:50:29,958 --> 01:50:34,500
This… Use these dialogues on stage.
Why in the bedroom?

1389
01:50:34,583 --> 01:50:35,958
It's to delay the climax.

1390
01:50:36,958 --> 01:50:39,791
Do you understand? So we can go on and on.

1391
01:50:39,875 --> 01:50:43,541
I'm a test match player, baby.
I'm a Dravid, not Afridi.

1392
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:47,958
In fact, try it with your husband.

1393
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:50,291
Holy Incense Stick will turn into a torch.

1394
01:50:53,041 --> 01:50:54,958
-Fuck you.
-Hey, it works.

1395
01:50:55,041 --> 01:50:56,625
What to tell you?

1396
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:00,333
Shall we drink?

1397
01:51:28,166 --> 01:51:29,791
-Hindi?
-Yes.

1398
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,416
I can't read Hindi.

1399
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:35,041
Read. You read!

1400
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:40,958
Okay.

1401
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:46,333
Nobody can do what you did.

1402
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:49,458
You know, my grandma used to say…

1403
01:51:50,291 --> 01:51:55,333
"If someone helps you selflessly,
keep them close for eternity."

1404
01:51:59,666 --> 01:52:00,750
Right?

1405
01:52:00,833 --> 01:52:04,000
Someone once told me
that I am fun when I am drunk.

1406
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:08,208
Dude.

1407
01:52:08,291 --> 01:52:10,333
Didn't you ever want to meet me?

1408
01:52:10,416 --> 01:52:12,541
I wanted to, but then I changed my mind.

1409
01:52:13,416 --> 01:52:15,625
I imagined you as a trophy wife.

1410
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:20,833
Your foreign vacation pictures
on Insta with #Wanderlust.

1411
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,416
And you waiting for likes.

1412
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:27,541
Attending high-society parties
with a fake accent and a fake smile.

1413
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:30,625
I imagined you this way.

1414
01:52:31,958 --> 01:52:34,083
That made it easy to move on.

1415
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,916
You are taunting me, right, asshole?

1416
01:52:40,125 --> 01:52:41,541
It's not what you think.

1417
01:52:42,291 --> 01:52:43,958
Shekhar is my--

1418
01:52:44,041 --> 01:52:45,416
-Phone.
-What?

1419
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:46,750
Phone.

1420
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:49,625
Baby! Talk of the devil.

1421
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:51,291
Devil?

1422
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:52,208
I WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE WITH YOU

1423
01:52:52,291 --> 01:52:54,500
With you…

1424
01:53:10,458 --> 01:53:11,625
Are you from Kerala?

1425
01:53:12,375 --> 01:53:14,000
-Are you a Malayali?
-Yes, I am.

1426
01:53:14,083 --> 01:53:16,791
-Me too.
-Yeah, I figured.

1427
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:20,166
Who's that?
Boyfriend, husband, or brother?

1428
01:53:20,250 --> 01:53:22,666
It depends on how much I drink.

1429
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,833
You are funny. Come, let's dance.

1430
01:53:24,916 --> 01:53:26,583
Sure. Why not? Play our song.

1431
01:53:26,666 --> 01:53:29,333
Let me show you my wedding venue.

1432
01:53:29,416 --> 01:53:32,125
Villa at Lake Como.

1433
01:53:32,208 --> 01:53:35,625
And Shekhar has booked two entire flights.

1434
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,125
Why are you giving me
this sarcastic smile?

1435
01:53:40,916 --> 01:53:43,041
You don't even have a passport.

1436
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:45,583
That's true.

1437
01:53:46,333 --> 01:53:47,208
Cheers!

1438
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:50,750
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

1439
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:54,291
What kind of song is this?

1440
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:14,291
Let's go. Come on.

1441
01:54:36,833 --> 01:54:39,458
My hand is hurting. Slow down. Leave me!

1442
01:54:39,541 --> 01:54:41,583
My hand is hurting. Let go.

1443
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,000
What's wrong with you?

1444
01:54:44,083 --> 01:54:46,000
Are you my husband? No, right?

1445
01:54:46,083 --> 01:54:48,083
Boyfriend? No!

1446
01:54:48,166 --> 01:54:50,750
How does it matter to you if I dance?

1447
01:54:59,041 --> 01:55:00,208
What happened?

1448
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,875
Are you missing Mummy and Papa?

1449
01:55:05,916 --> 01:55:09,333
A little. They must be crying for me.

1450
01:55:14,041 --> 01:55:18,625
When we get the money tomorrow,
you will be with them,

1451
01:55:18,708 --> 01:55:20,333
and I will be with Ruhi.

1452
01:55:23,583 --> 01:55:25,791
But what will we do with the money?

1453
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:29,791
Well, we need that money to bring Ruhi…

1454
01:55:33,208 --> 01:55:34,250
Let me explain.

1455
01:55:39,916 --> 01:55:43,125
So, you love Chiku, don't you?

1456
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:47,166
But Chiku is with that boy now.

1457
01:55:48,041 --> 01:55:52,791
So if you had enough money,
won't you pay them and bring Chiku back?

1458
01:55:54,666 --> 01:55:55,666
No.

1459
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:57,500
Why?

1460
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,791
Because Chiku is happy
with that boy. I saw that.

1461
01:56:02,875 --> 01:56:04,916
And if Chiku is happy, I am happy.

1462
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:50,291
What is it?

1463
01:56:54,125 --> 01:56:55,208
Scratch my back.

1464
01:57:01,083 --> 01:57:02,750
Why were you in jail?

1465
01:57:03,875 --> 01:57:06,041
-Murder.
-What?

1466
01:57:06,125 --> 01:57:08,708
-It's a murder case.
-Whose?

1467
01:57:08,791 --> 01:57:11,125
You know that builder, Bhinder?

1468
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:21,125
Why are you laughing?

1469
01:57:22,833 --> 01:57:23,875
What?

1470
01:57:26,416 --> 01:57:28,291
Get lost, you murderer.

1471
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:29,750
What a nutcase!

1472
01:57:41,625 --> 01:57:43,458
Couldn't you find any other way?

1473
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:46,125
Maniac!

1474
01:57:46,958 --> 01:57:49,416
-What's going on?
-Who are these people?

1475
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:57,458
-Let's go.
-Where are you climbing on to?

1476
01:57:57,541 --> 01:58:00,708
-His intentions are not good.
-Let go or I'll kick you, bastard!

1477
01:58:05,125 --> 01:58:06,041
Who is that?

1478
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,333
Mannu, watch it!

1479
01:58:10,416 --> 01:58:11,791
I'll kill you. Shut up.

1480
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:16,791
-Are you ready?
<i>-Yes, I've just passed through S6.</i>

1481
01:58:17,625 --> 01:58:19,833
<i>No, not now. Keep going, I'll tell you.</i>

1482
01:58:23,916 --> 01:58:25,750
Aalu, be careful!

1483
01:58:28,333 --> 01:58:31,500
Why are you taking me so high?
You're trying to save me or kill me?

1484
01:58:40,375 --> 01:58:41,791
Get lost!

1485
01:59:03,500 --> 01:59:04,458
Mini!

1486
01:59:06,583 --> 01:59:07,541
Mini!

1487
01:59:46,583 --> 01:59:47,875
What time is it?

1488
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:51,250
It's almost 6:30 a.m.

1489
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:08,333
Don't look here.

1490
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:10,750
Okay.

1491
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:22,958
What… How foolish can I be?

1492
02:00:24,250 --> 02:00:26,208
Why did I get drunk last night?

1493
02:00:33,416 --> 02:00:34,958
I don't remember anything.

1494
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:39,250
I don't remember anything. Total blackout.

1495
02:00:40,916 --> 02:00:43,666
-What did you eat last night?
-Chili chicken.

1496
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:45,500
You remember everything.

1497
02:00:52,666 --> 02:00:54,458
How long are you going to deny it?

1498
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:56,291
Deny what?

1499
02:00:56,958 --> 02:00:58,500
As if you don't know.

1500
02:00:59,083 --> 02:01:00,416
Don't do this, Akash.

1501
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:07,333
My flight is in three hours,
and I am getting married in two days.

1502
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,625
Let people watch that clip.

1503
02:01:09,708 --> 02:01:12,125
I am leaving,
even if we don't find the camera.

1504
02:01:13,041 --> 02:01:16,083
Yeah, you are a master at it.
The art of leaving.

1505
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:29,000
Who are you running away from?

1506
02:01:31,416 --> 02:01:32,500
From yourself?

1507
02:01:34,791 --> 02:01:39,083
-Both of us know that--
-Don't! Don't do this, Akash.

1508
02:01:39,166 --> 02:01:42,125
Please! Please not right now.

1509
02:01:43,291 --> 02:01:47,083
I have been taught
only one thing since I was little.

1510
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:50,208
If you want a good life,
if you want to be happy,

1511
02:01:50,291 --> 02:01:53,250
you need a good husband,
from a well-to-do family.

1512
02:01:53,833 --> 02:01:55,083
That's it.

1513
02:01:55,166 --> 02:02:00,375
I learned to sing, to cook,
good etiquettes, good English, for what?

1514
02:02:00,458 --> 02:02:02,666
Make-up, fashion, for what?

1515
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:05,375
Just so that one day,

1516
02:02:05,458 --> 02:02:08,250
I would get married
to a rich, handsome Mr. Perfect.

1517
02:02:08,333 --> 02:02:12,666
And guess what? It's happening.
And I am very happy, Akash.

1518
02:02:12,750 --> 02:02:14,125
Can't you see?

1519
02:02:19,625 --> 02:02:20,541
No!

1520
02:02:23,333 --> 02:02:25,000
I know where I am going.

1521
02:02:25,083 --> 02:02:27,375
Don't distract me from it.

1522
02:03:04,416 --> 02:03:05,791
I LOVE YOU. I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

1523
02:03:14,250 --> 02:03:15,625
<i>Hello, ma'am.</i>

1524
02:03:15,708 --> 02:03:19,625
Hello, Sheeja. Where have you been?
I called you so many times.

1525
02:03:19,708 --> 02:03:22,583
It was an emergency. I am fine, ma'am.

1526
02:03:22,666 --> 02:03:23,875
I am okay.

1527
02:03:23,958 --> 02:03:25,583
<i>Where are you?</i>

1528
02:03:25,666 --> 02:03:29,666
I am staying in Hotel Paradise.

1529
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:32,125
Hotel? Alone?

1530
02:03:32,208 --> 02:03:34,416
No, I am with Rahul.

1531
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:37,291
Rahul? Who is Rahul?

1532
02:03:37,958 --> 02:03:42,416
Rahul is a friend. A special friend.

1533
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:44,458
I want you to meet him. Please come.

1534
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:45,833
I'll try to.

1535
02:03:45,916 --> 02:03:47,291
Call your mother.

1536
02:03:47,375 --> 02:03:49,000
Yes, I will.

1537
02:03:56,208 --> 02:03:57,791
Let me look for a shop.

1538
02:04:56,625 --> 02:04:57,875
Rahul, help!

1539
02:04:57,958 --> 02:05:00,458
Help! Rahul!

1540
02:05:07,958 --> 02:05:09,583
Give me a packet of cigarettes.

1541
02:05:09,666 --> 02:05:11,666
-Hello?
<i>-Welcome to Hotel Paradise.</i>

1542
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:13,125
-Hotel Paradise?
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

1543
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:21,791
Hey! No! I'm here. Bastard!

1544
02:05:22,375 --> 02:05:25,833
You thief! Son of a bitch!

1545
02:05:25,916 --> 02:05:27,250
Thief!

1546
02:05:32,666 --> 02:05:34,541
You will come to meet me, right?

1547
02:05:34,625 --> 02:05:37,250
-Yes.
-Bring Ruhi along.

1548
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:38,541
Sure.

1549
02:05:40,583 --> 02:05:42,375
A bull and a bullock cart!

1550
02:05:42,458 --> 02:05:45,083
Carrying a tiny tot!

1551
02:05:45,166 --> 02:05:47,125
A bull and a bullock cart!

1552
02:05:47,208 --> 02:05:48,500
Carrying a…

1553
02:06:14,041 --> 02:06:15,791
Hey, stop.

1554
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:17,958
Bittu!

1555
02:06:42,416 --> 02:06:43,625
Stop!

1556
02:06:43,708 --> 02:06:44,708
Hey…

1557
02:06:52,708 --> 02:06:56,583
What are you doing, asshole? Just stop!
Asshole!

1558
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:03,250
Shit, he locked it! What's the password?

1559
02:07:03,333 --> 02:07:06,000
Paradise. It's close to the bypass.

1560
02:07:06,083 --> 02:07:08,291
Okay. I'll share it via WhatsApp.

1561
02:07:08,375 --> 02:07:11,583
Mr. Sukumar is coming with the force.
They'll be here in 15 minutes.

1562
02:07:11,666 --> 02:07:15,500
Shruti, you can leave. I'll handle it.

1563
02:07:15,583 --> 02:07:16,500
No, I'll stay.

1564
02:07:16,583 --> 02:07:21,125
Asshole! Take us to your room. Come on.

1565
02:07:30,041 --> 02:07:32,791
How does it open?

1566
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:38,416
You asshole! Trying to pull
a fast one on us! Bloody traitor!

1567
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:07,083
Rock him for a while.

1568
02:08:07,166 --> 02:08:08,750
Here is some money. Keep it.

1569
02:08:09,416 --> 02:08:10,791
There is a man in Sitapur.

1570
02:08:10,875 --> 02:08:13,375
Call him.
He will help you cross the Nepal border.

1571
02:08:14,458 --> 02:08:15,791
Take care of yourself.

1572
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:20,416
Bloody asshole!

1573
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:22,791
Go on.

1574
02:08:27,291 --> 02:08:29,250
Its gear gets stuck sometimes.

1575
02:08:31,083 --> 02:08:32,125
Bye, Babu.

1576
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:41,458
Let's go?

1577
02:08:59,583 --> 02:09:03,125
No… No cry! No.

1578
02:09:04,166 --> 02:09:05,083
I won't cry.

1579
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:09,541
I won't cry.

1580
02:09:12,291 --> 02:09:13,333
Pinky…

1581
02:09:34,083 --> 02:09:36,583
Papa, the mobile has stopped working.

1582
02:11:54,458 --> 02:11:56,541
-Is this the climax?
-Yes, sir.

1583
02:11:56,625 --> 02:11:58,291
They'll be here soon.

1584
02:11:58,375 --> 02:12:01,500
-How much time do we have?
-Enough to play a game of<i> Ludo.</i>

1585
02:12:02,208 --> 02:12:03,208
Bro.

1586
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:06,166
Always before time.
Were you a premature baby?

1587
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:07,583
Let's play <i>Ludo.</i>

1588
02:12:07,666 --> 02:12:10,583
Well, it's fun talking
to you while playing <i>Ludo.</i>

1589
02:12:13,666 --> 02:12:16,333
Coming straight to the point.
The good old question.

1590
02:12:16,416 --> 02:12:21,041
-How do you define sin and virtue?
-And you're back to square one.

1591
02:12:21,125 --> 02:12:22,625
Okay, tell me this.

1592
02:12:22,708 --> 02:12:25,458
-Were the Kauravas heroes or villains?
-Villains.

1593
02:12:25,541 --> 02:12:28,208
-And who were the heroes?
-Pandavas, obviously.

1594
02:12:28,291 --> 02:12:31,916
So when Yudhisthira died
and reached heaven,

1595
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,541
he noticed that Duryodhana
is having fun with the fairies.

1596
02:12:35,625 --> 02:12:38,750
And he asked,
"Where are my brothers and Draupadi?"

1597
02:12:38,833 --> 02:12:40,750
The reply he got was, "In hell."

1598
02:12:40,833 --> 02:12:43,625
-Sir, this can be explained.
-Forget the explanation.

1599
02:12:43,708 --> 02:12:47,041
Didn't you just say
the Kauravas were the villains?

1600
02:12:47,125 --> 02:12:48,833
Then why is Duryodhana in heaven?

1601
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:52,791
So what does it mean?

1602
02:12:52,875 --> 02:12:55,083
That you can never give a straight answer.

1603
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,625
It takes a lifetime
to understand sin and virtue.

1604
02:12:58,708 --> 02:13:00,750
And you want a straight answer?

1605
02:13:06,666 --> 02:13:07,666
Hi, baby.

1606
02:13:09,916 --> 02:13:11,458
Why? I can come on my own.

1607
02:13:13,291 --> 02:13:14,458
No, not now.

1608
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:17,458
Yes, I have given up.

1609
02:13:22,708 --> 02:13:26,875
Can't you keep your ego aside
for your daughter's sake?

1610
02:13:26,958 --> 02:13:28,375
Yes, Papa, exactly.

1611
02:13:28,458 --> 02:13:30,791
-That is not fair.
-Not fair?

1612
02:13:32,166 --> 02:13:35,458
Okay. Then you can go.
And take your mommy with you!

1613
02:13:36,333 --> 02:13:38,833
She loves to attend lavish weddings.

1614
02:13:38,916 --> 02:13:44,083
In fact, she's very proud of you
that you did what she couldn't.

1615
02:13:44,166 --> 02:13:47,125
Marrying a rich and successful man.

1616
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,583
I thought we shared everything.

1617
02:14:35,666 --> 02:14:38,041
But you kept such a big secret from me.

1618
02:14:40,041 --> 02:14:41,583
Your clip is on the internet.

1619
02:14:46,458 --> 02:14:47,750
Did you watch it?

1620
02:14:47,833 --> 02:14:51,000
Baby, you are famous.
50 lakh people have watched it.

1621
02:14:51,083 --> 02:14:52,416
He's the guy, right?

1622
02:14:54,625 --> 02:14:57,750
You should have just come to me.
I would have made it go away.

1623
02:14:59,666 --> 02:15:03,250
You met with an accident?
The police called me. I was so worried.

1624
02:15:04,125 --> 02:15:08,083
Thank God you used my credit card or
I couldn't have tracked this hotel down.

1625
02:15:09,208 --> 02:15:11,166
I can't imagine what you've gone through.

1626
02:15:12,666 --> 02:15:15,750
It's okay. Stop crying.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

1627
02:15:47,625 --> 02:15:49,791
-Did you find him?
-Yes.

1628
02:15:49,875 --> 02:15:50,833
Okay.

1629
02:15:51,458 --> 02:15:53,500
Which way is room 104?

1630
02:15:53,583 --> 02:15:55,416
My orthopedic doctor is here.

1631
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,791
-Shekhar.
-Akash.

1632
02:16:08,208 --> 02:16:10,333
What? What's so funny?

1633
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:14,666
Sorry. Not for you, man. I'm very sorry.
I don't know what's going on.

1634
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:16,041
I'm getting a call.

1635
02:16:18,041 --> 02:16:18,875
Police.

1636
02:16:19,583 --> 02:16:20,416
Hello?

1637
02:16:40,541 --> 02:16:41,666
Hit it.

1638
02:17:01,208 --> 02:17:04,875
-Hey, go get the car.
-Okay.

1639
02:17:34,875 --> 02:17:36,625
Control room. Come in, control room…

1640
02:17:36,708 --> 02:17:39,708
Sattu <i>bhaiya</i>
has been spotted at Paradise Hotel.

1641
02:17:39,791 --> 02:17:42,541
<i>At least five armed gangsters are here.</i>

1642
02:17:42,625 --> 02:17:44,208
<i>Please send backup immediately.</i>

1643
02:18:00,333 --> 02:18:02,750
What a rotten day!
Pee on me and shit on me, too!

1644
02:18:06,833 --> 02:18:07,708
Police.

1645
02:18:07,791 --> 02:18:09,541
Turn right!

1646
02:18:11,541 --> 02:18:13,333
I said, turn right!

1647
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:47,166
There, we are stuck.
We'll be running all our lives now.

1648
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:48,833
It's your fault.

1649
02:18:48,916 --> 02:18:51,791
If you hadn't followed me,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

1650
02:18:52,375 --> 02:18:53,875
I'm talking to you!

1651
02:18:55,208 --> 02:18:58,833
Listen, stop overreacting.
I'm not the only man to do it.

1652
02:18:58,916 --> 02:19:01,000
Everyone does it. All my friends do it.

1653
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:04,791
Even your uncle did it,
but he never got caught.

1654
02:19:05,375 --> 02:19:09,541
And, listen, you are no saint, either.
I know everything.

1655
02:19:09,625 --> 02:19:15,416
Your lover boy, Aalu,
fucking moved mountains to save me.

1656
02:19:16,166 --> 02:19:19,541
I know the deal.
You must have rewarded him well.

1657
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:44,208
<i>The truth is</i>
<i>there is a devil inside each one of us.</i>

1658
02:19:45,041 --> 02:19:48,416
<i>Just like the bubbles in a bottle of soda.</i>

1659
02:19:49,083 --> 02:19:51,583
<i>All it takes is opening the bottle.</i>

1660
02:19:53,833 --> 02:19:57,250
<i>-There was a time</i>
<i>-There was a time</i>

1661
02:19:57,333 --> 02:20:02,083
<i>-When I lived with the faith</i>
<i>-With the faith</i>

1662
02:20:02,166 --> 02:20:06,041
<i>-In this world</i>
<i>-In this world</i>

1663
02:20:06,125 --> 02:20:11,250
<i>-I'd built my heaven</i>
<i>-My heaven</i>

1664
02:20:22,166 --> 02:20:28,875
<i>This is how I fell in love</i>

1665
02:20:39,375 --> 02:20:44,541
<i>And what came of it, love?</i>

1666
02:20:48,041 --> 02:20:51,833
<i>And what came of it, love?</i>

1667
02:21:03,041 --> 02:21:04,541
One.

1668
02:21:05,708 --> 02:21:06,875
Two.

1669
02:21:06,958 --> 02:21:11,041
Even the movie is coming to an end.
Please explain sin and virtue now.

1670
02:21:11,125 --> 02:21:13,625
Be independent. Find it yourself.

1671
02:21:13,708 --> 02:21:15,791
Okay, tell me this. What about Bittu?

1672
02:21:15,875 --> 02:21:18,416
-Heaven or hell?
-Heaven.

1673
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:23,541
Whatever his past might be,
he sacrificed himself for his family.

1674
02:21:23,625 --> 02:21:27,208
-And what about Sattu?
-Hell. Without a doubt.

1675
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:29,791
Not that simple.
He still has something to do.

1676
02:21:29,875 --> 02:21:32,125
-Not fair, sir.
-Life is not fair, bro.

1677
02:21:32,208 --> 02:21:34,750
-Life is just like--
-A game of<i> Ludo.</i>

1678
02:21:34,833 --> 02:21:35,666
Exactly.

1679
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:40,166
Whether you win or lose,
ultimately the tokens have to reach home.

1680
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:43,250
Death is the only truth in life.

1681
02:21:43,333 --> 02:21:45,333
Everything else is just a smokescreen.

1682
02:21:45,958 --> 02:21:48,416
-What do you mean?
-I mean, what you call six,

1683
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,625
might look like nine to me.

1684
02:21:50,708 --> 02:21:51,875
What?

1685
02:21:51,958 --> 02:21:54,708
Sin and virtue,
good and bad, heaven and hell

1686
02:21:54,791 --> 02:21:56,875
are just points of view, Chitragupta.

1687
02:21:56,958 --> 02:21:59,583
God and devil, heaven and hell,

1688
02:21:59,666 --> 02:22:04,916
they are just means people came up with
to control this out-of-control world.

1689
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,875
<i>Yamraj, you are confusing me.</i>

1690
02:22:06,958 --> 02:22:10,250
<i>So are we just a figment of imagination?</i>

1691
02:22:39,125 --> 02:22:40,750
Our kids…

1692
02:22:42,083 --> 02:22:43,291
and their kids…

1693
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:47,208
will lead…

1694
02:22:48,708 --> 02:22:49,708
a lavish life.

1695
02:22:50,333 --> 02:22:51,708
Come on.

1696
02:23:02,625 --> 02:23:06,250
<i>-There was a time</i>
<i>-There was a time</i>

1697
02:23:06,333 --> 02:23:11,166

<i>-With the faith</i>

1698
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:15,125

02:23:15,208 --> 02:23:19,458
<i>-I'd built my heaven</i>
<i>-My heaven</i>

1700
02:23:19,541 --> 02:23:21,000
I need one last favor.

1701
02:23:21,083 --> 02:23:22,166
Tell me.

1702
02:23:22,875 --> 02:23:24,500
Who else could I have gone to?

1703
02:23:25,958 --> 02:23:26,916
Tell me.

1704
02:23:31,125 --> 02:23:37,333
<i>That's how I fell in love</i>

1705
02:23:48,166 --> 02:23:52,708
<i>And what came of it, love?</i>

1706
02:24:08,708 --> 02:24:11,416
-Hello?
-Hi.

1707
02:24:14,208 --> 02:24:15,166
Flight?

1708
02:24:16,791 --> 02:24:17,791
I missed it.

1709
02:24:21,208 --> 02:24:23,000
-Your wedding?
-I broke it off.

1710
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:32,083
I have some conditions.
I want an AC. A fan won't do.

1711
02:24:32,166 --> 02:24:35,125
Proper bathroom, with a door.
No jokes when I snore.

1712
02:24:35,208 --> 02:24:39,041
Brush before bed and shower before sex.
And why do you have so many plants--

1713
02:24:46,791 --> 02:24:47,916
I love you.

1714
02:25:34,791 --> 02:25:38,791
{\an8}<i>My eyes have</i>

1715
02:25:38,875 --> 02:25:42,125
{\an8}<i>Sworn, my love</i>
