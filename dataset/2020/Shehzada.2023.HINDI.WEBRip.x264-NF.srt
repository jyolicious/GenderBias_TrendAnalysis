1
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:50,700
Thank God.

2
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,033
Congratulations. It's a boy.

3
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,533
Thank you for the good news.

4
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,266
If you are looking for a reward,
then you may head to the special ward.

5
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,066
Maybe a prince is being born there.

6
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,166
Go.

7
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,366
Sister, clean the baby
and keep him in the crib next to his mom.

8
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,266
I will inform Mr. Jindal and his family.

9
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,466
I can't understand a word, Pandit Ji.

10
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,766
Is it a good or a bad sign
to be born during a deluge?

11
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
- Sir.
- Okay.

12
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,666
- So...
- Sir, I need to make an urgent call.

13
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,466
Can't you see I am on a call?

14
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:14,700
Sir, it's an emergency. Please!

15
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,000
What happened?

16
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:20,399
A baby was born in
the special ward some time ago.

17
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:23,500
The boy was stable
when the doctor checked him.

18
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,266
But now he is not breathing.

19
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
The baby belongs to the Jindal family.

20
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,566
I will call you back, Pandit Ji.

21
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:39,033
The doctor has already informed
the family that their son is healthy.

22
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:41,266
They are powerful people.

23
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:45,300
I am afraid they might blame me.

24
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,733
Let's exchange their son with mine.

25
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,166
Even we were blessed with a son today.

26
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,320
And who would understand
this joy better than me?

27
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:26,466
I've been working for them for years.

28
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,233
I owe them everything I have.

29
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,266
This sacrifice is too small compared
to their favors.

30
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,566
What about your wife?

31
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,333
How will you convince her?

32
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:41,133
God will bless us with another child.

33
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,166
We cannot do this. It's wrong!

34
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,233
No.

35
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,100
A good deed can never go wrong.

36
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,166
Never.

37
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:17,633
Let's go.

38
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,066
Pick him up.

39
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,366
Pick up the child.

40
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,760
We are doing a good deed.
Don't be afraid. Pick him up.

41
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Let's go.

42
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:06,766
Hurry up.

43
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,166
Come on.

44
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,666
He is alive.

45
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,166
Thank God!

46
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,366
Look, sir.

47
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,766
Give him to me.

48
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,200
Now he is mine.

49
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,333
No, sir.

50
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,300
It was supposed to be a sacrifice.

51
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,533
But you are being deceitful now!

52
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Deceitful?

53
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:01,633
His father and I joined
the company together.

54
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,166
We drove to the office together
on my scooter.

55
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:07,466
But somehow he was able
to charm Jindal's daughter.

56
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,166
From an assistant,
he became their son-in-law.

57
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,200
And I remained an employee.

58
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,700
Now, while he rides in luxury,

59
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,166
I still get soaking wet
riding my old scooter.

60
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,066
Because he was lucky.

61
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
But this child…

62
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,700
He could have cried

63
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,666
when we exchanged him with my son.

64
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,766
But he cried after we exited the room.

65
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:34,433
Why?

66
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,066
Because he is unlucky, like me.

67
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,666
Now he will lead an ordinary life,

68
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:46,233
and my son will live like a king.

69
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,033
This is worse than betrayal.

70
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,366
- It's a sin.
- Shut up.

71
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,233
Don't snatch a child from his mother.

72
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,000
I won't let you do it.

73
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,709
- Give me the child.
- Let go. Don't make a scene.

74
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,733
I will tell everyone.

75
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,300
- I will tell everyone.
- Who will believe you?

76
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,766
Valmiki. I've been blessed with a son.

77
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,700
- What about you?
- Me too.

78
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,200
Great. Congratulations.

79
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Congratulations.

80
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,433
All okay?

81
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,100
Yes. I just sprained my leg.

82
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
- Take care.
- Yes.

83
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,566
Sulochana! Lift her!

84
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
My son.

85
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,566
Our son.

86
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:16,033
I am running out of patience.
What's the name of my future successor?

87
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,266
Raj.

88
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,733
Raj Nanda.

89
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:22,766
Raj!

90
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,100
Raj Steels.

91
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:26,766
Raj Cargo.

92
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,300
A true prince!

93
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,666
Raj…

94
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,533
Do you like the name, Valmiki?

95
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Absolutely, sir.

96
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,466
Perfect name for
the successor of this empire.

97
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,126
Have you decided
what you will call your son?

98
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,666
Are you serious?

99
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,340
What kind of name is that?

100
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:47,633
It's absurd.

101
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,433
I will never allow you to call him this.

102
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,233
Poor kid will become a laughingstock.

103
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,166
And it also damages my reputation.

104
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,566
Goodbye!

105
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,466
- But…
- Pandit Ji!

106
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,000
Listen, Pandit Ji…

107
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,200
Pandit Ji!

108
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Bantu?

109
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,766
It sounds like the clanging of dishes.

110
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,433
- Bantu.
- Why?

111
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:12,366
Lord Ram calls Lord Hanuman "Bantu"
and still he is worshipped.

112
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't try to use this logic with me.

113
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,666
Lord Ram and Lord Hanuman are different.

114
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,533
Who will this boy serve?

115
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
What is this?

116
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Only nine marks in math?

117
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,466
So what if madam gave you less marks,

118
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:31,733
I'll make up for it.

119
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,333
And uncle Valmiki has a similar pen.

120
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:40,886
What are you doing, Valmiki?

121
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,500
Looking at Raj's report card.

122
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:43,609
How much did he score in math?

123
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:44,633
Take a look.

124
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:46,766
97.

125
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,200
Bravo, son.

126
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,300
Well done.

127
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,033
Can you guess Bantu's score in math?

128
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:59,666
- How much?
- Ninety-eight!

129
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,333
Gosh, lost out by two marks.

130
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,253
You should have scored 100 out of 100.

131
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
Don't be so mean.

132
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,400
He has scored such good marks.

133
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:12,633
Nobody remembers the guy
who gets out in his nineties.

134
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,366
Only centuries count.

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Some are just born unlucky.

136
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,633
Very sad.

137
00:13:57,366 --> 00:13:58,733
<i>The prince</i>

138
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,000
What are you doing here?

139
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,133
Don't worry.
This is just a dream.

140
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,333
Also known as nightmares in English.

141
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:34,000
Do you remember everything?

142
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Of course.

143
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:39,066
Twenty-five years ago you changed
this little guy's fortune!

144
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,566
I was destined to be a king.

145
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,133
Instead, I became a miser like you.

146
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,433
Time for you to wake up.

147
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,400
Stop watching these fancy dreams

148
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:49,533
and go make tea.

149
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,100
Bloody child swapper!

150
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,533
<i>The prince</i>

151
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,566
<i>The prince</i>

152
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,133
Dad, your tea.

153
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,300
Keep it downstairs.

154
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,100
Thank God!

155
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,500
If he is busy snoring here,

156
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,000
that means my son's living like
a king in his palace!

157
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Unbelievable.

158
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,166
How can he look so happy
for a guy who lost everything?

159
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Hey!

160
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,066
Hey!

161
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:53,133
Get up.

162
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,233
Grandma sent pickles.
Go collect it from the station.

163
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,466
Go on.

164
00:16:05,766 --> 00:16:06,766
Not fair, Mom.

165
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,666
You are so warm and loving in my dreams.

166
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,433
But in reality,
I've to endure his sarcasm.

167
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,366
How could you leave me alone
with this grouch?

168
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:17,266
Miss you, Mom.

169
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:30,733
Hey.

170
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,466
I guess that's Kumar here for his money.

171
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,266
Tell him I am not at home.

172
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Is your daddy at home?

173
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,233
Daddy?

174
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,066
Daddy, Poppa, father, pop…

175
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Is any of them at home?

176
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, that guy.

177
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,733
He said to tell you
that he's not at home.

178
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,766
You are a disgusting man!

179
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,733
Asking your son to lie!

180
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,666
Shameless.

181
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,820
I'll be back in the evening
for the rest of the money.

182
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,766
Why didn't you make
him sit on my lap instead?

183
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,366
All you had to say was
"Daddy is not at home".

184
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,633
Call your dad.

185
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,233
Daddy is not at home.

186
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,433
And he's definitely not behind
the wall or under the table.

187
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,233
And that's final.

188
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,733
You are such a lowlife!

189
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:34,533
We are middle-class people.

190
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:37,833
Being completely honest and moralistic
will make us misfits in society.

191
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,100
Your simplicity will get
us all killed someday.

192
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,566
If I tell the truth,
I'll be afraid only once.

193
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,333
But if I lie,

194
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll be afraid till I don't get caught.

195
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,766
Bravo, Bantu.

196
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Thanks, sis.

197
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,366
Here. Coconut and camphor.

198
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,633
And where is the garland?

199
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
We don't have it.

200
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
You guys forgot to get the garland.

201
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,366
He's returning from America
after completing his graduation.

202
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,333
Useless.

203
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,400
He didn't win any medals.

204
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,566
It took him six years
to complete a four-year course.

205
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,266
No need to glorify his blunders.

206
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:23,566
It's okay, sir.

207
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:28,066
Dad. Seven years.

208
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Seven?

209
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,533
Embarrassing!

210
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,500
- Hello.
- Are you at the station?

211
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,066
Grandma sent pickles
for the entire neighborhood.

212
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,133
Keep it aside.

213
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,366
And get a garland immediately
to Jindal sir's residence.

214
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:50,166
Is Jindal sir getting married at this age?

215
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:53,466
Stupid. I just want a garland.

216
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,600
- Garland.
- Who is getting married?

217
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Your dad!

218
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,333
Stop, uncle. I have arrived
at my destination.

219
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,233
Hey.

220
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,153
- Where do you think you are going?
- Relax.

221
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:35,633
It's heavy.

222
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Not your cup of tea.

223
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,500
I've been carrying you around for ages.

224
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,433
This is child's play. Hand it over.

225
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,940
I've been observing since childhood.

226
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,066
You never let me in.

227
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:48,633
What is the problem?

228
00:19:50,033 --> 00:19:52,200
Son, this is heaven!

229
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:57,400
The only way to gain access
is to earn merits or die trying.

230
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,633
Some are just born unlucky.

231
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,100
Very sad.

232
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:07,133
Raj has arrived!

233
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,533
Raj has arrived.

234
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,700
He has a place for everyone
in his heart except for me.

235
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Thanks, Val.

236
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Welcome, home.

237
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:39,700
Grandpa.

238
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Hey, Dad.

239
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:44,633
Welcome back.

240
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,033
I made your favorite <i>kheer.</i>

241
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,433
I hope it's made of almond milk, Mom.

242
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,000
Master Raj, the <i>kheer</i>
is made from the milk

243
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,700
- of our in-house cow, Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth?

244
00:20:58,766 --> 00:21:03,200
We moved heaven and earth
to get her here from the Swiss mountains.

245
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,200
Even he's traveled 12,000 kilometers.

246
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,033
Yes, I am extremely tired.

247
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,033
CP, please.

248
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,333
Listen…

249
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,000
All the best, brother.

250
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,100
Hope you get the job this time.

251
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:20,633
Focus on your studies.

252
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:23,466
Let's go.

253
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:45,233
Did you not see what happened?

254
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,266
I would understand if they were girls.

255
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,200
But what will those boys do
with your pink veil?

256
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,433
People should steal stuff they can use.

257
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,333
Someone misbehaved with your sister,

258
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:57,766
and that didn't make you mad.

259
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,433
Relax.

260
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,733
You are expecting too much from me.

261
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,100
I am getting late. Bye.

262
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,266
Next year on <i>Raksha Bandhan,</i>
we can switch roles,

263
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,266
so, I can protect you.

264
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,200
Because clearly, you couldn't!

265
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,000
That hurt my ego.

266
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,100
If you ever want
to get a job done by a man,

267
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,300
just hurt his ego.

268
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,766
Where will I find them now?

269
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:31,433
<i>Everyone says</i>

270
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:36,133
<i>My sister is one in a million</i>

271
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:39,633
Hello, Nisha.

272
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,400
Sorry for overreacting, brother.

273
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,400
Doesn't matter.
I found your veil.

274
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
How?

275
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,166
We haven't decided yet.

276
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,366
Brother, that pink veil
belongs to my sister.

277
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,400
Your sister is damn hot, man.

278
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:57,766
Thanks, man.

279
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:01,433
Please return the veil.

280
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
We'll return the veil,
in exchange for your sister.

281
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:32,000
<i>The prince</i>

282
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,133
Veil.

283
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,366
No…

284
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,166
Veil.

285
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,266
When you said,
"Your sister is damn hot.",

286
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,000
I wasn't upset at all.

287
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,700
She is a beautiful girl.

288
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,233
In fact, I was happy that we will have
to spend less on her wedding.

289
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:49,166
That's how we think.
Middle-class mentality.

290
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:53,100
But then he interrupted
like an '80s villain.

291
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,913
"My sister in exchange for the veil."

292
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,466
Who talks like that?

293
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:58,400
He broke my heart.

294
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:26,566
<i>I lost my mind when I realized</i>

295
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:31,433
<i>You entered the lanes of my heart</i>

296
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Which floor?

297
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,766
- Your floor.
- Sorry…

298
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,200
Thirteenth… floor.

299
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,700
13.

300
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Legal Eagle.

301
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:51,566
Fooled you too, right?

302
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,500
I am 21 plus.

303
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,033
I am an adult.

304
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,533
The office is called Legal Eagle.

305
00:25:58,766 --> 00:25:59,766
All the best.

306
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:02,766
Best. Best. Best.

307
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,766
<i>I am madly in love</i>

308
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:32,100
<i>I can't stop loving you</i>

309
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,013
Are you applying for
the post of paralegal?

310
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,266
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:36,366
Bantu.

312
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,100
Government Law College, Amritsar.

313
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:40,733
Most of our applicants are Howard
and Cambridge graduates.

314
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,366
You don't stand a chance here.

315
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
I am sorry.

316
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:46,233
Rejecting me without seeing my merit.

317
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Not fair.

318
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,766
Okay. Come in.

319
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,033
This is Harmeet. My client.

320
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:58,033
He wants to divorce his wife Simran.

321
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:01,166
You can defend Simran,
and see if you can get us some alimony.

322
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:04,100
You have five minutes
to showcase your merit.

323
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,100
What?

324
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,200
Our life cannot be his audition.

325
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:09,366
Relax.

326
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,400
If he is any good, I will hire him.

327
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:12,633
Back to the case.

328
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:16,133
My client Harmeet has
accused his wife Simran,

329
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,733
she was a simple girl
when they got married.

330
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:23,500
But Harmeet's lifestyle
and fortune changed Simran's personality.

331
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,006
She calls herself a "socialite" now.

332
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:28,166
She uses me like an ATM.
Gold digger.

333
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:31,500
Who else will spend
the husband's fortune if not the wife?

334
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,700
The neighbor?

335
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,133
Until now,
Rashmi has never asked me for anything.

336
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,500
Then why do you like, share, and comment
on every Insta-post from her?

337
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,066
Like a stray dog.

338
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,533
Excuse me. Just mind your language.

339
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:44,200
So, there is still some hope.

340
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,709
Sister-in-law is suspicious about him,
which means she loves him.

341
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,666
You have complaints
because you still have hope.

342
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,300
Even I have complaints.

343
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,333
I wanted to continue working
after marriage.

344
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,400
But his father has a rule.

345
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,233
Chadda family women
never go out to work.

346
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:58,466
Ms. Samara.

347
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,366
Will you continue working after marriage?

348
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:01,566
Of course.

349
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:04,233
If an educated, talented, disciplined,

350
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,033
cute, hot, gorgeous, long-legged…

351
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,566
I kick pretty hard.

352
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Sorry.

353
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:11,766
You see…

354
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:14,233
Women today like to work
even after tying the knot.

355
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,500
So get with it, Harmeet.

356
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:17,366
Let her be self-reliant.

357
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:21,000
Can't work, can't have kids.

358
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,633
How can we be happy?

359
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,166
By trying.

360
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,300
First, take care of each other,

361
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:34,600
and then the baby.

362
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,766
And the thing about babies is,
they are like love.

363
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:39,266
Never plan it,

364
00:28:39,566 --> 00:28:40,566
let it be natural.

365
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,266
Love each other so madly,

366
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,100
that the child comes naturally.

367
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,609
If you have any other problems,
you can write to me.

368
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:54,200
Bantuka4@gmail.com

369
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,333
Now go and reproduce.

370
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,200
Brother, thank you for this.

371
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,080
So, what time should I come tomorrow?

372
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,433
You don't have to.

373
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,433
Being a lawyer you acted
like a relationship counselor.

374
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:08,066
You just lost me a client.

375
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,400
I am rejecting you based on your merit.

376
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:12,400
You have no future here.

377
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:13,666
Get out.

378
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:17,633
What are you doing?

379
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:19,566
Bag.

380
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,766
It's nearly a week since Raj came back.

381
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,300
I haven't seen him.
Where is he?

382
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,633
Master Raj left his room ten minutes ago.

383
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:39,300
Master Raj has arrived.

384
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:45,433
Master Raj.

385
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,300
Your avocado on sourdough toast.

386
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,633
There's a guy called Sarang.

387
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,100
Sarang deals in toys.

388
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:18,733
And uses our cargo planes to export them.

389
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:28,533
One day our hangars were raided.

390
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,566
And Sarang's real business
was exposed.

391
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,766
So we banned their company.

392
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,766
And his business shut down.

393
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:45,700
He is sending his brother
to get the ban lifted.

394
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:50,000
And your dad is sending you to say no.

395
00:30:53,566 --> 00:30:54,566
Sir. Tea?

396
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:56,266
No.

397
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,033
It's easy to say no to a waiter.

398
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,133
But equally difficult to a powerful man.

399
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,573
Son, if you can pull this off...

400
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:05,713
Then you will earn respect.

401
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,766
This is your test.

402
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,666
My son doesn't need to give any tests.

403
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,533
Just be yourself, Raj.

404
00:31:16,033 --> 00:31:17,300
That's all I want.

405
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,033
Uncle Kailash,
I am feeling a little uneasy.

406
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,333
Don't worry.
Your dad is with us.

407
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
- Where?
- In the coffee shop, at the back.

408
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,133
Hi.

409
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:56,000
You guys have banned our business.

410
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,633
Innocent children don't have toys.

411
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,733
Ask him what was in those toys.

412
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,133
We just need a signature.

413
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:06,333
Lift the ban,

414
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:08,033
so my men can resume work.

415
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,100
Impossible.

416
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Tell him.

417
00:32:12,566 --> 00:32:14,766
So, what have you decided?

418
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,433
Say no, Raj.

419
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,566
Why are you mum?

420
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,333
Why think so hard?

421
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:28,166
We have much to do together.

422
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,033
We are the future of these companies.
Sign it, man.

423
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:34,266
What are you doing?
Keep the pen down.

424
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,666
Raj, say no.

425
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:46,333
Say no, Raj.

426
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Stop laughing.

427
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:52,033
Say no, goddamnit.

428
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,333
Sarang.

429
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,500
The answer is no.

430
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,366
And no means no.

431
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,066
I will not let you use
my cargo or anyone else's.

432
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,133
The ban will never be lifted.

433
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,033
Get out of my office.

434
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,733
Your father is a stubborn man,

435
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
but not more than me.

436
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
I will see you again.

437
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Let's go, Vikrant.

438
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:31,133
- One cappuccino. Take away.
- Okay, sir.

439
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:42,666
Good afternoon.

440
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:44,266
Samara.

441
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,146
Why meet here?
I could have come down to your office.

442
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,566
By the way, thank you
for taking up this case.

443
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,166
Mr. Kakkad,
I cannot take your brother's case.

444
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,666
- Why?
- Because he is guilty.

445
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:57,533
How does that matter?

446
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,533
You can always twist the truth.

447
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:02,066
We have evidence that
he assaulted a woman.

448
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,133
What if I double your fee?

449
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,633
Our firm does not
defend clients like him.

450
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:11,000
You must have a price.

451
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
I don't.

452
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:17,233
And please don't upset me.

453
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:19,699
Or I will prosecute your brother.

454
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,133
Have a good day.

455
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,433
Say yes…

456
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:32,000
Or we have other means of persuasion.

457
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:34,000
Although I have no business here,

458
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,633
but you are breaking the law.

459
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:39,600
Section 268, committing public nuisance.

460
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,766
Don't stick your nose in this.

461
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:47,133
Let her go, mister,
or you'll be charged with section 354.

462
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:50,600
Misbehaving with a female is eve teasing.

463
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,433
Bloody Justice Chaudhury!

464
00:34:56,733 --> 00:34:57,666
Take that.

465
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:58,633
Oh, God!

466
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,766
You will never learn!

467
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,166
Section 503, physical intimidation.
Which means, threatening.

468
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,733
Threatening?

469
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:08,400
Take that…

470
00:35:10,766 --> 00:35:14,000
Great… Section 425.

471
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,366
Vandalizing public property.

472
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,366
I think you are hungry.

473
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,100
Rascal, you will teach me the law!

474
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:23,266
Take this!

475
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,166
Guys, where is the security?

476
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,100
You are going in for good.

477
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:29,733
Section 307, attempt to murder.

478
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,066
Leave me. Let's take this outside!

479
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,633
Bantu, right?

480
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,666
Government Law College, Amritsar.

481
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,666
You don't need a foreign degree
to learn justice.

482
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,166
I used every bit of my learnings today.

483
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:45,466
I will teach you the rest.

484
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:47,166
You are hired.

485
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:50,500
Thank you, madam.
Thank you.

486
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,100
Hey, stop!

487
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:53,500
Oh my God!

488
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,066
Stop it, silly.
Don't make me emotional.

489
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,166
Section 309, attempt to suicide.

490
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
Sorry, madam.

491
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:10,633
Now listen carefully.

492
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,566
Be it a good offer or bad,

493
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,600
when someone says no, it means…

494
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,600
No!

495
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:26,233
And when a girl says no, then it's a…

496
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:30,633
definite no!

497
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,166
Madam, we cannot hang around
after that legal class.

498
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:40,246
When the energy is high,
we should take an exit.

499
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:54,266
Good morning, madam.

500
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:55,733
What are you doing here?

501
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,333
Working out on my way to work.

502
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,666
In a suit?

503
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,476
While trying to keep up
with the pace of life,

504
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,100
I've no time to keep pace with myself.

505
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:04,300
And I also save some travel money.

506
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,600
- I read your file.
- Yes.

507
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,566
- People dream of going to Paris.
- Yes, yes.

508
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,766
- Driving a Ferrari.
- Yes, yes.

509
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:12,333
You wrote you never dream

510
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,560
because you are afraid
they will be second-hand dreams.

511
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,333
What does that even mean?

512
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,766
- Do you have time?
- Move aside.

513
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:20,433
Two more rounds.

514
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,100
Six… not done.

515
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:27,233
Dad. College starts tomorrow.

516
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:29,466
I need some money to buy new clothes.

517
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:32,766
I told Randeep's son that
Bantu starts college tomorrow.

518
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,100
He gave me all his used clothes
without saying a word.

519
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,633
And that's not all, Nisha!
See…

520
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:41,100
He even gave me his perfume.

521
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,166
Smell it.

522
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,133
- Wow.
- Yes.

523
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:46,366
I will even smell second-hand now.

524
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,133
A whiff of it
and it feels like Raj is right here.

525
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,166
Do you want it or not?

526
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Dad,

527
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,733
my shoes are torn.

528
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,333
Can you buy me these?

529
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:06,633
What is your shoe size?

530
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,233
Nine.

531
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Mine is eight.

532
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,109
It will soften up once
you start wearing it.

533
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,700
The shoe and your brains.

534
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,100
You are worse than an enemy!

535
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,433
Giving me his shoes!
My legs will bleed.

536
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,766
Dad, Bantu wants a new bike.

537
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,433
Bantu.

538
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,233
I inherited this from your grandfather.

539
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,466
Take good care of it.

540
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:39,366
Bantu. No need to be so emotional.

541
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,500
Enough. Let me go.

542
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:43,566
No.

543
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:44,766
You are safe like this.

544
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:48,466
If I let go, it can be painful for you.

545
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:59,666
Madam, I never had
an amazing day in my life.

546
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,233
I am here now.

547
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,066
Expect a miracle.

548
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,233
<i>I lost my mind when I realized</i>

549
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,000
<i>You entered the lanes of my heart</i>

550
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,500
<i>You are the answer to my prayers</i>

551
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:45,000
<i>You are the answer</i>

552
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,133
<i>To my prayers</i>

553
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,600
<i>That's the dream I had</i>

554
00:39:55,766 --> 00:40:00,166
<i>Can't take my eyes
Off you when you smile</i>

555
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:04,500
<i>You even made the sun blush</i>

556
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:09,366
<i>I lost my mind when I realized</i>

557
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:14,033
<i>You entered the lanes of my heart</i>

558
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>I feel lost</i>

559
00:40:18,466 --> 00:40:21,366
<i>It's so quiet</i>

560
00:40:22,466 --> 00:40:25,133
<i>I feel lost</i>

561
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
<i>It's so quiet</i>

562
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:31,766
<i>How did I let you convince me?</i>

563
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:36,233
<i>You are the answer to my prayers</i>

564
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,333
<i>That's the dream I had</i>

565
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,400
<i>I seek the one</i>

566
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:45,533
<i>Who understands my feelings</i>

567
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,000
<i>Doesn't have to take me to the moon</i>

568
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:50,000
<i>But has a heart of gold</i>

569
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:52,433
<i>Doesn't have to be a prince</i>

570
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,600
<i>But someone who can make me laugh</i>

571
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,033
<i>Takes me in his arms when I come home</i>

572
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:59,200
<i>Makes me feel like his queen</i>

573
00:40:59,633 --> 00:41:01,633
<i>I am just an ordinary girl</i>

574
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,566
<i>But love always brings a twist</i>

575
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,133
<i>I wish there's a guy out there</i>

576
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,600
<i>Who does what I say</i>

577
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,500
<i>If I ever find him</i>

578
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,100
<i>Never gonna let go</i>

579
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,333
<i>I am madly in love</i>

580
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,733
<i>I can't stop loving you</i>

581
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,433
<i>I steal a glance…</i>

582
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:29,333
<i>At you</i>

583
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,133
<i>I steal a glance at you</i>

584
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,433
<i>Your face dwells in my eyes</i>

585
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,200
<i>You are the answer to my prayers</i>

586
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:49,400
<i>That's the dream I had</i>

587
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:54,400
<i>I need you</i>

588
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:56,733
<i>I need…</i>

589
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,433
<i>I need you</i>

590
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,433
<i>I need you</i>

591
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:32,100
I bring 24 apples for you every year.

592
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,666
Two apples every month.

593
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,133
I bought 600 apples for you in 25 years.

594
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,233
As the saying goes,

595
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,700
an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

596
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:43,566
Only if you can eat it.

597
00:42:44,366 --> 00:42:45,566
But you don't wake up.

598
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,566
And the apples are wasted.

599
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,566
You are luckier than me.

600
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:54,233
You have been lying
in a coma for years.

601
00:42:54,466 --> 00:42:56,733
And Randeep is paying
for your treatment.

602
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,766
Because you delivered his baby.

603
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Hey.

604
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:06,033
Do you understand Hindi?

605
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I don't know.

606
00:43:07,366 --> 00:43:08,446
Is there anything I can do?

607
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:10,700
<i>We will do, we will fight, we will win</i>

608
00:43:11,033 --> 00:43:13,600
<i>We will do, we will fight, we will win</i>

609
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:16,400
<i>We will win We will win</i>

610
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:24,733
The <i>Gita</i> says the body is perishable,
not the soul.

611
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,166
Forsake this body.

612
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:28,766
Be free.

613
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:33,000
It will bring peace to you and me.

614
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:54,233
Doctor!

615
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,266
Doctor!

616
00:44:00,066 --> 00:44:01,066
Anybody there?

617
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:02,633
Anybody there?

618
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,733
- Doctor!
- Oh no.

619
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Doc…

620
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:08,709
- Sister, hurry up.
- Yes, doctor.

621
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:10,442
Oxygen.
Check her blood pressure and heart rate.

622
00:44:10,466 --> 00:44:11,500
Okay, doctor.

623
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,920
- Keep a check on her vitals.
- Yes, doctor.

624
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,633
- Is she going to wake up?
- Can't say.

625
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,533
But this has never happened before.

626
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,400
- Can she see?
- It's complicated.

627
00:44:20,466 --> 00:44:22,166
- Can she hear?
- I'm not sure.

628
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,633
- Can she speak?
- Impossible.

629
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,700
- Thank God.
- What?

630
00:44:24,766 --> 00:44:25,766
I mean, thank you.

631
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Thank you.

632
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:44,133
Why did I have to wear
a sari for this lunch, Dad?

633
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,066
They are the Jindals, child.

634
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:49,300
I would have worn regular clothes
for any other occasion.

635
00:44:49,366 --> 00:44:51,333
And if they ask you if you can cook,

636
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,633
tell them that you were
selected for Master Chef,

637
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,733
but you said no.

638
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,676
But why will they ask
me whether I can cook…

639
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Wait!

640
00:44:58,133 --> 00:44:59,333
Are we here to meet their son?

641
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:05,766
What would you prefer?

642
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:08,133
I would prefer a drink.

643
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,266
But that would upset Samara.

644
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,300
Dad, it's noon.

645
00:45:13,366 --> 00:45:15,566
It must be nighttime
somewhere in the world.

646
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,400
Scotch, Gin. Glass of rosé.
What would you like to have?

647
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:22,633
- How about a black rum with soda...
- Tea.

648
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:24,433
We will have tea.

649
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:25,733
Tea?

650
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:29,766
So, are we gonna see the boy,
or should we elders decide?

651
00:45:31,266 --> 00:45:32,266
Where is Raj?

652
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,133
Master Raj has arrived.

653
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
Park it.

654
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,500
Hello, uncle.

655
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:48,166
Wow! Swag with culture.

656
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,033
Not to mention the car.

657
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,133
Great.

658
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,566
The children might feel awkward
in front of us.

659
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:56,433
Raj. Take Samara for a walk.

660
00:45:57,266 --> 00:45:58,266
Come.

661
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
Do you have a cigarette?

662
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,733
No. No smoking, no drinking, pure vegan.

663
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
How sweet.

664
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:12,033
Do you have a cigarette?

665
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,000
I only have the local brand, madam.

666
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:17,133
Marblo Nights.

667
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,733
Great.

668
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,540
Tell me more about your family.

669
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:29,066
Just the three of us.

670
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:30,706
But the third member keeps changing.

671
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,200
Dad is naughty.

672
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,300
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

673
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,433
Me, my dad, and a new bottle every day.

674
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,666
Since mom's death, only alcohol
and sad songs could keep us company.

675
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,300
You know,
I had a girlfriend at the University.

676
00:46:45,066 --> 00:46:46,200
But things didn't work out.

677
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:49,533
Have you ever been in a relationship?

678
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,100
Several.

679
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:53,733
Sometimes boys! Sometimes girls!

680
00:46:54,133 --> 00:46:55,133
What?

681
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,233
Love doesn't care about gender.

682
00:46:57,666 --> 00:46:58,666
Don't mind.

683
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,233
But even I don't want
to keep secrets from you.

684
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:03,400
Do you even believe in marriage?

685
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:05,100
I have only one problem.

686
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:08,000
Why should I leave my house
and my dad?

687
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,166
Girls have shed too many tears.

688
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:12,409
It's the guy's turn
to sit in the palanquin now,

689
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:13,793
and I will come riding on a horse!

690
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:19,233
Shall we?

691
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,533
Mom. Dad. Grandpa.

692
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,366
Samara is not a woman.

693
00:47:33,066 --> 00:47:34,233
What nonsense is this?

694
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
She's a wonder woman!

695
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:41,300
I am ready to be the damsel in distress.

696
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:42,366
What?

697
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:44,200
Guys, I am ready for this marriage.

698
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:48,566
Wow, madam, you're getting married
in such a wealthy family.

699
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
He said yes.

700
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:52,633
How can anyone say no to you?

701
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:54,733
But I am not happy.

702
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,033
They are filthy rich.

703
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,309
Their home looks like a palace.

704
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,400
Even if you two fight,

705
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:01,409
the husband, and wife can
sleep in separate rooms.

706
00:48:01,433 --> 00:48:02,766
Where there is love,

707
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:05,353
the size of the house
doesn't matter, Bantu.

708
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,300
I do have a small house.

709
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Do you love me?

710
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:20,066
You belong in my dreams.

711
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,733
In reality, you are way beyond my reach.

712
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,366
One needs the heart to love not a house.

713
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,700
You will change your mind
when you see my house.

714
00:48:28,766 --> 00:48:30,466
Bantu, I really like you.

715
00:48:30,633 --> 00:48:33,266
I don't believe in all that.
I believe in love.

716
00:48:34,633 --> 00:48:35,633
Okay.

717
00:48:37,266 --> 00:48:38,500
Then let's fall in love.

718
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:44,600
Will you be able to?

719
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,300
Of course.

720
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,533
Now I feel embarrassed, madam.

721
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,766
Madam...
Can you stop calling me madam?

722
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,333
Why don't you ever wear a pant?

723
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,166
Sorry.

724
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Did I hit too hard?

725
00:49:05,566 --> 00:49:06,566
Yes.

726
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,200
But I am enjoying it now.

727
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:10,566
Madam…

728
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:14,433
Baby. Babe. BooBoo…

729
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,040
Call me anything you like.

730
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:17,233
Just don't call me madam.

731
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,400
I'll need some time, madam.

732
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,733
I'll need some time…

733
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,066
Boo Boo.

734
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:35,200
<i>I wonder what spell you have cast on me</i>

735
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:42,466
<i>I am ready to follow you
Wherever you take me</i>

736
00:49:57,666 --> 00:50:03,266
<i>Since the day I met you
I don't need any friends</i>

737
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:10,633
<i>Since the day I met you
I don't need any friends</i>

738
00:50:12,433 --> 00:50:14,300
<i>You are so cute</i>

739
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:18,000
<i>I would rather call you cuteness</i>

740
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:23,000
<i>I will take care of you
You are responsibility</i>

741
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,633
<i>Tell your family, now it's my turn</i>

742
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,400
<i>You are going to be all mine now</i>

743
00:50:30,466 --> 00:50:34,000
<i>I've taken a detour towards your lane</i>

744
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,500
<i>I am cute and you're one in a million</i>

745
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:41,433
<i>I am cute and you're one in a million</i>

746
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,233
<i>For you, I dumped my other girlfriend</i>

747
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,766
<i>You're so cute
And I'm one in a million</i>

748
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:52,400
<i>You're so cute
And I'm one in a million</i>

749
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:56,266
<i>I am cute and you're one in a million</i>

750
00:50:56,333 --> 00:51:00,133
<i>For you, I dumped my other girlfriend</i>

751
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:07,266
<i>I wonder what spell you have cast on me</i>

752
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:18,500
<i>Let's start this love story</i>

753
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,300
<i>Come tease me, beloved</i>

754
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:24,133
<i>I don't say yes to everyone</i>

755
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:26,033
<i>But I said yes to you</i>

756
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,400
<i>I will go with you, beloved</i>

757
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,500
<i>- There is no lover like me
- Is there anyone?</i>

758
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:33,366
<i>- I am a classic
- Is there anyone?</i>

759
00:51:33,433 --> 00:51:35,342
<i>- Is there anyone tall and dark like me?
- Is there anyone?</i>

760
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:37,166
<i>- A crazy maniac
- Is there anyone?</i>

761
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:39,076
<i>- Someone to challenge your dad
- Is there anyone?</i>

762
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,700
<i>And beg him if need be
Is there anyone?</i>

763
00:51:40,733 --> 00:51:42,633
<i>No fat fat, left to right</i>

764
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:47,500
<i>Like dhoom chak chak
Dhoom dhoom chak</i>

765
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:51,533
<i>Last night I told my friends</i>

766
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,333
<i>I've stolen the moon from the stars</i>

767
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,066
<i>I am going to keep you away
From prying eyes</i>

768
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:02,500
<i>I've taken a detour towards your lane</i>

769
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:06,233
<i>I am cute and you're one in a million</i>

770
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,166
<i>I am cute and you're one in a million</i>

771
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:13,733
<i>For you, I dumped my other girlfriend</i>

772
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,466
<i>You're so cute
And I'm one in a million</i>

773
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:21,133
<i>You're so cute
And I'm one in a million</i>

774
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,766
<i>I am cute and you're one in a million</i>

775
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:28,666
<i>For you, I dumped my other girlfriend</i>

776
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:36,100
<i>I wonder what spell you have cast on me</i>

777
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,400
<i>I am ready to follow you
Wherever you take me</i>

778
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:00,233
Yes, sir.

779
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:02,166
Okay, sir.

780
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:04,666
Excuse me.
He is ready to see you.

781
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,733
Hello, Mr. Randeep.

782
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:18,476
Since the children couldn't agree,

783
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,233
I thought I should come
to meet the father.

784
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,100
My decision won't change at any cost.

785
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,300
Randeep!

786
00:53:30,633 --> 00:53:33,400
I keep extending my hand in friendship,
and you keep ignoring it.

787
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,100
I am not scared of you.

788
00:53:36,166 --> 00:53:37,533
Next time get an appointment.

789
00:53:38,066 --> 00:53:39,166
Not fair, Mr. Randeep.

790
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,586
I've incurred far too many losses
because of you.

791
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:46,066
Sarang, your toys are stealing
the children's innocence.

792
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,500
And you, my business.

793
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:50,466
My principles are far more important
than business.

794
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:53,566
Isn't there any solution?

795
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,733
There is.

796
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,300
Shut down your business.

797
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:03,233
So you won't lift the ban?

798
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,733
Then I must get rid of you.

799
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:42,513
My dad will never agree to this.

800
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:44,633
That's why we came to meet Raj's dad.

801
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:46,633
We will tell him the truth about us.

802
00:54:46,766 --> 00:54:48,686
Worst case scenario,
he will give one tight slap!

803
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,400
It's the least you can do for love.

804
00:54:56,233 --> 00:54:57,300
There is no one here.

805
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,533
He is a busy man.
Must be in a meeting.

806
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:15,733
Sir.

807
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:17,733
Sir. Sir.

808
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:19,333
Sir.

809
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,700
- Sir.
- Sir.

810
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,233
Somebody help!

811
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,180
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No, call his driver.

812
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:27,233
Okay.

813
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,100
Sir. Sir.

814
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,433
Shit!

815
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,700
Where are the stairs?

816
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,100
Bantu, he is losing blood.

817
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,466
We must inform his family.

818
00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:13,000
Sir. Sir.

819
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
Hey…

820
00:56:37,366 --> 00:56:38,566
Sir. Sir.

821
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:40,466
Sir.

822
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:42,466
Sir.

823
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:05,633
Open it.

824
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,266
That's our car.

825
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:26,733
And we stabbed him.

826
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:28,533
Let him go.

827
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:55,400
Sir. Sir.

828
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,600
I will inform the family.

829
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,666
Don't worry. I'll call someone.

830
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,733
Who was that?

831
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:45,633
Ran…

832
00:58:46,133 --> 00:58:48,466
- What?
- Ran…

833
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:50,166
Ran…

834
00:58:50,233 --> 00:58:51,733
- Randeep?
- Yes.

835
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,233
Do you know him?

836
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:55,633
Wha…

837
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:56,766
What happened to him?

838
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:58,266
Someone…

839
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,066
He met with a small accident.

840
00:59:03,066 --> 00:59:04,233
Don't worry.
He will be fine.

841
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:06,133
Is he…

842
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:09,500
Is he your father…

843
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:12,300
Unfortunately, he's not my father.

844
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:20,566
That's my father.

845
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,300
There.

846
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:57,233
- Tell me.
- He is not…

847
00:59:57,633 --> 00:59:59,033
Your father…

848
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,400
Ran…

849
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,233
Ran…

850
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,100
Your words won't alter the truth.

851
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:06,633
- No.
- Take rest.

852
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,400
Please sit, sir.
I'll check where madam is.

853
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,133
He is not your father.

854
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,500
He isn't.

855
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:20,766
I think you are not feeling well.

856
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:21,766
I will call the doctor.

857
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:23,566
Wait… listen…

858
01:00:23,633 --> 01:00:25,500
- I'll be right back.
- Hear me out.

859
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:27,066
- Please, calm down.
- Listen to me…

860
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,200
He is not your father!

861
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,133
He is Valmiki.

862
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,266
How do you know my father?

863
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,400
Valmiki is not your father.

864
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:55,166
Randeep.

865
01:00:57,233 --> 01:00:59,133
Randeep is your father.

866
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,766
I don't understand what you are saying.

867
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:09,133
I exchanged you with my own hands.

868
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:16,233
You weren't breathing
after you were born.

869
01:01:46,033 --> 01:01:48,566
You are the Jindal family prince.

870
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,166
The real prince.

871
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:05,133
I took the silver spoon from you

872
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,666
and changed your destiny.

873
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:12,633
My sin doesn't let me live or die.

874
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:15,766
We must tell your father the truth.

875
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,033
I owe this to him.

876
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,433
Go call your father.

877
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,666
I must tell him the truth.

878
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,676
I want to tell him that you are his son.

879
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,100
Call your father.
Call Randeep.

880
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:29,266
Call him. I want to tell him
that you are his son.

881
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:32,033
Call, Randeep. Call him.
I want to tell him.

882
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,566
- Call him. Call him.
- He is inside...

883
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:57,666
Why is this patient here?

884
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:00,266
- Sister.
- Yes, doctor.

885
01:03:01,033 --> 01:03:02,033
What are you doing?

886
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:03,366
Why is this patient here?

887
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
- Let's shift her to critical care.
- Okay, doctor.

888
01:04:02,266 --> 01:04:04,200
Kailash, how is Randeep?

889
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,133
I spoke with the doctors.

890
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,466
His heart is intact,
but he's lost blood.

891
01:04:10,233 --> 01:04:11,233
Everything else is fine.

892
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,233
I don't think so, Kailash.

893
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:15,700
What about security?

894
01:04:46,366 --> 01:04:47,366
What happened?

895
01:04:48,133 --> 01:04:49,133
Who is he?

896
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,666
That's Bantu.
He works in my office.

897
01:04:53,366 --> 01:04:54,633
If it wasn't for him,

898
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,540
Uncle would have never
made it to the hospital.

899
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Thank you.

900
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,333
Kailash, give him some money
and tell him to leave.

901
01:05:07,266 --> 01:05:08,266
It's okay, Bantu.

902
01:05:08,733 --> 01:05:09,733
Don't mind her.

903
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:24,600
Thank you, son.

904
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
Come.

905
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:33,733
Just give me a minute.

906
01:05:52,266 --> 01:05:54,400
I've been working for them for 25 years.

907
01:05:55,433 --> 01:05:59,466
But they don't even
let me stay in the same room.

908
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:02,066
All rich people are the same.

909
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,433
They will keep reminding
you of your place.

910
01:06:07,233 --> 01:06:09,433
We are not their family.
We should stay away.

911
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,466
That's how the world works!

912
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:13,566
He is the king
and we are his servants.

913
01:06:23,566 --> 01:06:24,566
She is no more.

914
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,466
Peace be with her.

915
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:43,433
- I will tell everyone.
- Who will believe you?

916
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,333
- Did you know her?
- No.

917
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,520
Look at her lying like an orphan.

918
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:05,400
No family, nor any friends.

919
01:07:06,033 --> 01:07:08,700
This is definitely
because of her bad karma.

920
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:12,433
As the saying goes…
God sees all.

921
01:07:18,466 --> 01:07:19,533
What are you staring at?

922
01:07:21,366 --> 01:07:22,486
Do you have anything to say?

923
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,400
Shut up!

924
01:08:06,533 --> 01:08:08,653
Out of all days,
this scooter had to break down today!

925
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,666
Not only did you slap your father,

926
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,466
but you are also keeping mum.

927
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:20,700
Don't you have anything to say?

928
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,333
You are not my real father.

929
01:08:26,566 --> 01:08:28,300
I am not your real father!

930
01:08:28,533 --> 01:08:30,033
I am not your real father!

931
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,633
If I am not your father,
then where did you come from?

932
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,033
Did you fall from the sky?

933
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,300
No.

934
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,200
You pulled me down from heaven
and slammed me on the ground.

935
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,566
That nurse was in a coma for 25 years.

936
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:46,100
Are you going to believe
the nonsense she says?

937
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:52,433
I never mentioned any nurse.

938
01:09:17,766 --> 01:09:19,433
I am the Jindal family heir.

939
01:09:20,433 --> 01:09:21,766
Randeep is my father.

940
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Yes or no?

941
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:27,399
I've been hearing
your bullshit all my life.

942
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:29,133
Speak up!

943
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:30,466
Now!

944
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:38,066
I just wanted to see my son happy.

945
01:09:38,366 --> 01:09:40,066
And see Randeep's son unhappy.

946
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:42,733
So, you were punishing
me for the last 25 years.

947
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:44,666
What harm did I ever cause you?

948
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:02,366
Will you tell
the Jindal family everything?

949
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:04,733
Please.

950
01:10:05,233 --> 01:10:07,166
Don't tell anyone.

951
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:14,066
Are you crazy?

952
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:18,000
What will I get by telling them?

953
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,266
Money? Wealth? Car?

954
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:21,566
Screw that!

955
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,333
What's interesting is,

956
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:26,466
you know that I know.

957
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,133
What did you get
from learning the truth?

958
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,400
Freedom.

959
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,133
I always wondered,

960
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:40,633
that no matter what I do,
I can never impress my father.

961
01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:42,666
But now I have my answer.

962
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Now I am free.

963
01:10:44,266 --> 01:10:45,266
Free.

964
01:10:46,566 --> 01:10:47,566
Valmiki.

965
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:50,700
I used to cringe seeing you.

966
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,166
But now I feel pity for you.

967
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,300
Because you can't
tell him he's your son,

968
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,733
and I won't acknowledge
you as my father!

969
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:00,166
It's the end of my exile.

970
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,666
Time to return home.

971
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:08,633
<i>The prince</i>

972
01:11:28,666 --> 01:11:29,666
- Valmiki.
- Yes.

973
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:33,100
I want to meet your son.

974
01:11:34,066 --> 01:11:36,400
I want to hug him and say thank you.

975
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:37,466
Excuse me.

976
01:11:38,066 --> 01:11:40,633
This nurse and I treated your son-in-law!

977
01:11:40,733 --> 01:11:43,500
You should be hugging and thanking us.

978
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:44,566
Who are you?

979
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,033
Hello, I am an open-heart surgeon, okay?

980
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,400
For an open heart surgeon,
you have a not-so-open heart.

981
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:51,600
- This is no way to speak.
- Sir. Sir.

982
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,200
Is he crazy? Bloody oldies!

983
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:56,266
Never upset your doctor or driver.

984
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,533
If they twist the injection
or steering wheel to the wrong side,

985
01:11:59,633 --> 01:12:00,633
then it's game over.

986
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:03,366
So, calm down.

987
01:12:40,733 --> 01:12:42,300
You should have been here yesterday.

988
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:43,733
Where were you?

989
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:45,566
No one called me.

990
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:47,666
Your father is in the hospital.

991
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:50,300
Do you need an invitation
to come and see him?

992
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:53,500
And why did you bring
a bouquet like a foreigner?

993
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,033
Master Raj, balloons were a better idea.

994
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,000
We should have gone with the balloons.

995
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:11,506
What is the billed amount?

996
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,433
1,20,000, sir.

997
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,333
Round it up to one million.

998
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,266
Sir, 1,20,000 can be
rounded off to 1,50,000.

999
01:13:19,433 --> 01:13:21,273
- Not one million.
- Don't forget our old deal.

1000
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:25,200
You get five percent.
I get the rest.

1001
01:13:26,366 --> 01:13:28,033
God bless you.

1002
01:13:28,266 --> 01:13:29,500
Plus GST.

1003
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,133
You're too much, sir.
Consider it done.

1004
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:48,666
Sir, avoid t-shirts for some time.

1005
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,300
- Shirts will be more comfortable.
- Why?

1006
01:13:51,766 --> 01:13:53,466
God. There he goes again.

1007
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:56,333
My son-in-law looks handsome in t-shirts.

1008
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,133
That has nothing to do with this.

1009
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:00,306
And this is not fashion advice,
it's medical advice.

1010
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:03,533
Sir, shirt…

1011
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:05,533
T-shirt.

1012
01:14:06,133 --> 01:14:07,133
Muscle strain.

1013
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:09,233
Get it?

1014
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:12,000
Anyway, he needs positivity around him.

1015
01:14:12,266 --> 01:14:13,500
Not negative people like us.

1016
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,666
Like that boy who brought him
to the hospital.

1017
01:14:16,066 --> 01:14:16,766
Call him.

1018
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:18,433
- Sister.
- Yes, doctor.

1019
01:14:19,066 --> 01:14:20,066
Here.

1020
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,333
Great.

1021
01:14:21,566 --> 01:14:23,566
Your son-in-law's
blood pressure has become normal,

1022
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,166
as soon as I mentioned that boy.

1023
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:28,033
See, 120/80. Perfect.

1024
01:14:29,033 --> 01:14:30,033
Sir.

1025
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,166
How will his presence affect his health?

1026
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,466
See for yourself.

1027
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:38,600
But never believe an MBBS,
M.D, FRCS doctor like me.

1028
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:40,409
You guys keep questioning my abilities!

1029
01:14:40,433 --> 01:14:41,766
- Doctor...
- Don't touch.

1030
01:14:42,433 --> 01:14:44,466
Last time you were against him.

1031
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:46,000
Now you want me to call him here.

1032
01:14:46,133 --> 01:14:47,333
- Answer him.
- Go ahead.

1033
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:50,033
Sir, just give me a chance.
Even we doctors have children.

1034
01:14:53,266 --> 01:14:54,266
My son?

1035
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,266
His BP will spike at this rate.

1036
01:14:58,366 --> 01:14:59,366
Go, get him.

1037
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:01,266
He's at work.

1038
01:15:01,433 --> 01:15:03,133
Tell him to take a few hours off.

1039
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,533
It's not a government job.

1040
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,233
Tell him to take the whole day off.

1041
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,566
They will fire him.

1042
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:09,300
Tell him to quit then.

1043
01:15:09,366 --> 01:15:11,000
It's his bread and butter.

1044
01:15:11,066 --> 01:15:13,433
Send him over to my house.
I will take care of his needs.

1045
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:15,433
- He's talking rubbish!
- Whenever I call him,

1046
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,466
you always make some excuse.
What is your problem?

1047
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,633
No problem, sir.

1048
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,500
- Then what's the problem?
- No problem.

1049
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,600
Then call him.

1050
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:23,186
- Call him.
- Call him quickly, please.

1051
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:25,433
The battery is down.

1052
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:26,933
Give me his number.
I will call him.

1053
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,566
I'll call him.

1054
01:15:32,766 --> 01:15:36,200
Listen, Jindal sir wants to meet you.

1055
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:39,400
But I won't let you set foot in here.

1056
01:15:39,733 --> 01:15:41,233
Like the gully boys say,

1057
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:42,633
"My time will come."

1058
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,733
But your time will never come.

1059
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:47,733
As soon as you hang up,
the doctor will call me.

1060
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:52,633
How do you know the doctor is inside?

1061
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:54,333
Where are you?

1062
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,433
Check outside the gate.

1063
01:15:59,533 --> 01:16:04,200
<i>I am here to stay for good</i>

1064
01:16:04,466 --> 01:16:08,033
<i>I will be everyone's favorite</i>

1065
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,400
What did you do with the doctor?

1066
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,400
He didn't want to look at you earlier,

1067
01:16:12,466 --> 01:16:13,642
and now he's asking for an appointment.

1068
01:16:13,666 --> 01:16:14,700
Relax.

1069
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,533
When you kidnap someone's child,

1070
01:16:16,766 --> 01:16:18,033
he's bound to react like that.

1071
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,366
Did you kidnap his son?

1072
01:16:21,633 --> 01:16:23,166
Yes. That's him.

1073
01:16:27,566 --> 01:16:31,433
SUPERHERO

1074
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,166
- Hello.
- Is he coming?

1075
01:16:33,566 --> 01:16:35,333
Yes, sir. He is.

1076
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:41,033
You have been seeing
your son for 25 years.

1077
01:16:42,066 --> 01:16:44,400
Now I will meet my father
for the first time.

1078
01:17:23,266 --> 01:17:25,700
<i>With little dreams
And years of accounts</i>

1079
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,000
<i>Everyone's friend is here</i>

1080
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,700
<i>Take a good look, make some noise</i>

1081
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:33,000
<i>I am here now</i>

1082
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:35,700
<i>From rags to riches
Like a spear of destruction</i>

1083
01:17:35,766 --> 01:17:38,000
<i>He is reaching for the sky</i>

1084
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:40,733
<i>Shining so bright
Put your glasses on</i>

1085
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,266
<i>Witness his glory now</i>

1086
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:48,000
<i>I am here to stay for good</i>

1087
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:52,600
<i>I will be everyone's favorite</i>

1088
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:55,433
<i>I am not innocent nor naive</i>

1089
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,000
<i>But I am your best friend forever</i>

1090
01:17:58,066 --> 01:18:02,400
<i>I promise, I will be…</i>

1091
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:06,433
<i>The prince</i>

1092
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:09,466
<i>The prince</i>

1093
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:12,533
<i>The prince</i>

1094
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,200
<i>The prince</i>

1095
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:19,766
<i>I am the… prince</i>

1096
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:25,400
<i>The prince</i>

1097
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:41,100
<i>I've longed to be back home</i>

1098
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:43,500
<i>It's been a decade now</i>

1099
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:48,466
<i>I can feel the love shower
On me as they open their hearts</i>

1100
01:18:48,533 --> 01:18:51,100
<i>I can hear laughter on one side</i>

1101
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:53,466
<i>and sighs coming from another</i>

1102
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:55,700
<i>This is where I played my games</i>

1103
01:18:55,766 --> 01:18:58,300
<i>I can feel the blessings of my mother</i>

1104
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:02,766
<i>Someone will finally feed me</i>

1105
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:07,566
<i>My childhood will return</i>

1106
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,433
<i>One with a true and kind heart</i>

1107
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,766
<i>With the key to your destiny</i>

1108
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:17,433
<i>He is called</i>

1109
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:21,666
<i>The prince</i>

1110
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:24,333
<i>The prince</i>

1111
01:19:26,066 --> 01:19:31,033
<i>The prince</i>

1112
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:40,433
<i>I am not innocent nor naive</i>

1113
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,000
<i>But I am your best friend forever</i>

1114
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:46,000
<i>I promise</i>

1115
01:19:46,066 --> 01:19:50,633
<i>I will be…</i>

1116
01:19:57,166 --> 01:20:03,266
<i>The prince</i>

1117
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,300
<i>The prince</i>

1118
01:20:13,366 --> 01:20:18,566
<i>I am the… prince</i>

1119
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:23,166
<i>The prince</i>

1120
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:31,233
My son is here.

1121
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,200
Where is my son?

1122
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,000
- Relax.
- I cannot.

1123
01:20:35,066 --> 01:20:36,266
He is at the ice cream parlor.

1124
01:20:36,333 --> 01:20:37,433
I'll leave in a jiffy.

1125
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,366
I didn't pay for the ice cream.

1126
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:40,433
I will.

1127
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:42,100
He also has my headphones.

1128
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,266
I'll buy you new ones.

1129
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:45,133
Who kidnaps a fat kid?

1130
01:20:45,233 --> 01:20:46,233
Bloody criminal.

1131
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:51,000
Your father kept you
away like some treasure.

1132
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:53,366
We never met.

1133
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:55,466
Come here.

1134
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:18,633
You have strong arms.

1135
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,133
That day, you didn't just
save my son-in-law,

1136
01:21:24,433 --> 01:21:27,233
you saved this family's honor,
the Jindal empire,

1137
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:30,333
and our pride.

1138
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:35,466
You work for Raj's fiancée, don't you?

1139
01:21:35,566 --> 01:21:37,300
- Yes, sir.
- Does she pay well?

1140
01:21:37,733 --> 01:21:39,233
The contract said 25,000.

1141
01:21:39,533 --> 01:21:44,400
But after deducting taxes
I get 3000 in hand, sir.

1142
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,500
I will give you 50,000. Tax-free.

1143
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:47,566
Come work for me.

1144
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:51,000
Sir, you are spoiling
him with more money.

1145
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,476
He will get spoilt if you give him,

1146
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,333
but I will make him someone worthwhile.

1147
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:55,826
Will you come to work for me?

1148
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:57,166
Of course, sir.

1149
01:21:57,266 --> 01:22:00,066
Choose any room,
with a desk and computer.

1150
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:01,300
But what will be my job?

1151
01:22:01,366 --> 01:22:03,133
Exactly, what can he do?

1152
01:22:03,233 --> 01:22:04,600
He will hang out with me.

1153
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,600
I am a lonely old man.

1154
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,100
Right, buddy?

1155
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,300
Yes, buddy.

1156
01:22:13,433 --> 01:22:14,433
Buddy?

1157
01:22:14,766 --> 01:22:16,666
You don't know what you are saying!

1158
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:18,700
I have a lot to do.

1159
01:22:19,366 --> 01:22:20,846
I have to meet the other rich people.

1160
01:22:21,533 --> 01:22:23,166
Share a cup of green
tea with Jindal sir.

1161
01:22:23,433 --> 01:22:25,366
I am busy, Valmiki. Get lost.

1162
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:28,066
Rascal.

1163
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:31,233
Can't believe all this is mine.

1164
01:22:36,766 --> 01:22:38,366
You know I am a simple man.

1165
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,033
I don't like to lie or cheat people.

1166
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,266
Unbelievable, sir.

1167
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,066
Preaching what you don't practice.

1168
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:45,466
I have a lot to learn from you.

1169
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Who are you?

1170
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,166
Bantu, with love.

1171
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:50,633
And in hatred,

1172
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:52,766
still Bantu!

1173
01:23:06,133 --> 01:23:09,133
- What is this?
- Eggs Benedict for master Raj.

1174
01:23:09,566 --> 01:23:10,666
Master Raj's eggs.

1175
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,900
Make the same for me, starting tomorrow.

1176
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:14,133
But I will have ten eggs.

1177
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:16,033
Okay.

1178
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:18,766
He looks like the scrambled egg type.

1179
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:23,666
Get me a cup of tea!

1180
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,300
Excuse me.
I am not a servant.

1181
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,600
I am Arun.

1182
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,600
A family member of this family since 1990.

1183
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:32,609
Why didn't I see you earlier?

1184
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:35,133
Because I am the busy type.

1185
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,700
I have my pilates classes.

1186
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:38,666
Can I? Thank you.

1187
01:23:40,733 --> 01:23:42,000
These rich people are so weird.

1188
01:23:42,466 --> 01:23:45,033
Butlers dressed in suits,
owners dressed in shorts.

1189
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,133
- Sir.
- Hey, how did you like the house?

1190
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,600
Like paradise.

1191
01:23:53,266 --> 01:23:55,200
It's so beautiful that I feel I am dead.

1192
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,533
But I didn't like one thing.

1193
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:00,266
You guys are not united,

1194
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:02,000
that's why he was attacked.

1195
01:24:02,633 --> 01:24:04,073
By the way, what did the police say?

1196
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,200
We filed a complaint,

1197
01:24:05,266 --> 01:24:07,266
but Sarang is an unpredictable guy.

1198
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,300
I don't deal with guys like him.

1199
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,733
But I can.

1200
01:24:11,233 --> 01:24:12,233
What?

1201
01:24:12,366 --> 01:24:14,000
Let's go talk to him.

1202
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:15,333
Shall we?

1203
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:17,266
Didn't you say you wanted to hang out?

1204
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:19,066
Right, buddy?

1205
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,733
Sir!

1206
01:24:48,266 --> 01:24:50,000
- Who are you?
- Grandpa.

1207
01:24:50,266 --> 01:24:52,400
I mean, he's as old as your grandpa.

1208
01:24:52,566 --> 01:24:55,633
You use his planes to
smuggle your goods around.

1209
01:24:55,766 --> 01:24:57,333
But you don't know who he is.

1210
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,233
The founder. Aditya Jindal.

1211
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,440
- Show some respect.
- How did you guys get to Mauritius?

1212
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,500
We flew.

1213
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,766
I flew business class,
and my buddy was in first.

1214
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:09,666
Though we had a smooth landing

1215
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,680
but faced some turbulence
when we got here.

1216
01:25:33,433 --> 01:25:34,433
Get the car.

1217
01:25:35,133 --> 01:25:36,133
Let's go back.

1218
01:25:36,733 --> 01:25:38,333
No, sir. We came all the way.

1219
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,600
How…

1220
01:25:45,733 --> 01:25:47,000
Same feeling.

1221
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,500
The hand print.

1222
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:51,000
Who pushed him?

1223
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,566
That boy saved Randeep.

1224
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:05,333
But who will save you?

1225
01:26:05,766 --> 01:26:07,600
<i>"The prince."</i>

1226
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:32,566
<i>The prince</i>

1227
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:43,100
Pick up the crates. Hurry up.

1228
01:26:46,266 --> 01:26:47,266
Who pushed him?

1229
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:48,433
Where did he come from?

1230
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,500
Who pushed him? Who?

1231
01:27:12,433 --> 01:27:14,233
Who touched him? Tell me.

1232
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,433
- Was it you? Did you touch him?
- No.

1233
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:20,766
- Did you push him?
- No, I didn't push him.

1234
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:22,066
Did you push him?

1235
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,000
How dare you!

1236
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,033
Who touched him?

1237
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:31,600
How dare you touch him?

1238
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,300
Yes?

1239
01:27:33,366 --> 01:27:35,500
Gather uncle's stuff.

1240
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:37,433
Hurry up. Give it to me.

1241
01:28:03,366 --> 01:28:05,000
<i>The prince</i>

1242
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,600
Chilled coconut water.
Especially for you, sir.

1243
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:21,333
Eau de cologne towel, sir.

1244
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,133
It will calm you down.

1245
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,033
Who was it? Who pushed him?

1246
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:28,333
What do you think, sir?
We all pushed him?

1247
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,666
You already punched
the guy who pushed him.

1248
01:28:30,733 --> 01:28:31,633
There he is.

1249
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,100
Folded up like a new Samsung phone.

1250
01:28:38,766 --> 01:28:39,766
Where is your boss?

1251
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,366
He is inside.
But you need to yell to call him.

1252
01:28:43,433 --> 01:28:45,000
Sir!

1253
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,000
It's very clear.

1254
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:50,233
He says your brother is a scoundrel!

1255
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,600
But his case is weak

1256
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:53,386
because he doesn't have evidence.

1257
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,500
I came here and threw
your men around like ping-pong balls.

1258
01:28:56,766 --> 01:28:58,266
There's no proof of that, as well.

1259
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:00,200
So, henceforth no more violence.

1260
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,600
That's all we had to say.

1261
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,400
Buddy, that's the end of our hangout.
Let's go or we'll miss our flight.

1262
01:29:07,366 --> 01:29:10,233
Are you going to say something
or just stare, son?

1263
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,980
You can write if you don't want to say it.

1264
01:29:14,033 --> 01:29:15,500
Bantuka4@gmail.com

1265
01:29:25,766 --> 01:29:27,300
Shouldn't this boat be in the water?

1266
01:29:27,766 --> 01:29:29,600
It's a car, Bantu. Not a boat!

1267
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:31,300
What is this model called?

1268
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:33,400
RR.

1269
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,566
Looks like it's Rajamouli's car.

1270
01:29:41,233 --> 01:29:42,233
Wow.

1271
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,766
The tuxedo and the car look rented.

1272
01:29:45,666 --> 01:29:48,100
Can we take a selfie
before I give you my two cents?

1273
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:56,200
Nice umbrella.

1274
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,480
Don't let me get my hands on it.

1275
01:29:59,333 --> 01:30:00,566
I can be reckless with it.

1276
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,633
Let's go, we'll miss our flight.

1277
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:09,666
This car is a beauty.

1278
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:12,066
You should get a couple of these, buddy.

1279
01:30:16,733 --> 01:30:17,733
You called, sir?

1280
01:30:18,133 --> 01:30:19,166
Bantu, come.

1281
01:30:20,033 --> 01:30:21,600
We haven't spoken since you got here.

1282
01:30:21,733 --> 01:30:22,733
Tell me, sir.

1283
01:30:23,766 --> 01:30:27,000
What you did for
a total stranger is commendable.

1284
01:30:27,633 --> 01:30:28,633
Thank you.

1285
01:30:29,066 --> 01:30:30,366
If not me then who else?

1286
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:33,466
But I am no one to you.

1287
01:30:34,133 --> 01:30:35,133
You are.

1288
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,500
What?

1289
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,666
Boss.

1290
01:30:58,366 --> 01:30:59,366
You know, Bantu.

1291
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,100
The most difficult battles in life,

1292
01:31:05,766 --> 01:31:07,266
are the ones against your own family.

1293
01:31:16,666 --> 01:31:17,746
What did my son-in-law say?

1294
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,500
A lot.

1295
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:22,600
He's mad about the
dispute with my daughter, isn't he?

1296
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:24,100
He's bound to be.

1297
01:31:24,633 --> 01:31:27,200
They haven't spoken for seven years.

1298
01:31:28,033 --> 01:31:29,033
Did he say anything else?

1299
01:31:29,466 --> 01:31:32,233
He didn't, but you just did.

1300
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,466
Buddy, this family has issues.

1301
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:39,400
During tough times,
your family is your strength.

1302
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,766
But when your own family
leaves you stranded,

1303
01:31:42,566 --> 01:31:43,566
who do you turn to?

1304
01:31:44,133 --> 01:31:45,133
Hey, Dad.

1305
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,233
Morning, uncle J.

1306
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,466
They are beyond help.

1307
01:31:49,266 --> 01:31:51,300
And he will never understand.

1308
01:31:51,466 --> 01:31:53,033
He is a weird guy.

1309
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,066
No one knows what's on his mind.

1310
01:31:55,733 --> 01:31:59,166
Just for once, I want to see him
explode with anger.

1311
01:32:00,233 --> 01:32:02,033
Then I can die peacefully.

1312
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:05,033
He will explode,
and you don't have to die.

1313
01:32:06,033 --> 01:32:07,033
You know, buddy.

1314
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,166
Poor had only one thing.

1315
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:10,733
Grief.

1316
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,540
And the rich took over that as well.

1317
01:32:24,566 --> 01:32:26,500
Hey, you have work to do,

1318
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,533
and you are out here smoking.

1319
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:31,033
Don't do that.
These people are naive.

1320
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,400
So naive that you swapped their baby.

1321
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:37,200
Valmiki, I am the owner of
this building, this garden, and you.

1322
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,680
Talking in English feels better
when you are dressed like this.

1323
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:42,033
Now get out!

1324
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:43,709
Otherwise, I will deduct your salary!

1325
01:32:43,733 --> 01:32:45,100
- Hey!
- Hey!

1326
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:46,700
Get lost.

1327
01:32:46,766 --> 01:32:47,766
Get lost.

1328
01:32:49,066 --> 01:32:50,066
Come on.

1329
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:51,766
Rascal.

1330
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:54,733
Dad first brought Randeep

1331
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:56,733
and gave him the entire business.

1332
01:32:57,233 --> 01:32:59,233
And he's been torturing us ever since.

1333
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,366
Now he's got this new guy…

1334
01:33:01,433 --> 01:33:03,433
Who will screw us sooner or later!

1335
01:33:03,633 --> 01:33:05,533
There is something about him.

1336
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,200
We should offer him our friendship.

1337
01:33:10,133 --> 01:33:11,166
Nice boy.

1338
01:33:13,533 --> 01:33:15,533
An everyday expenditure worth 1,50,000?

1339
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:17,266
Twenty-five thousand on fuel.

1340
01:33:17,333 --> 01:33:18,813
There are several cars in the office.

1341
01:33:19,466 --> 01:33:20,766
Twenty-five thousand for snacks.

1342
01:33:21,033 --> 01:33:22,273
We have several poor employees.

1343
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:25,000
Fifty thousand for coffee.

1344
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:26,600
Are we buying Starbucks?!

1345
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:35,666
I am discussing accounts,

1346
01:33:35,766 --> 01:33:37,066
and you are winking at me.

1347
01:33:37,266 --> 01:33:38,266
They did.

1348
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:41,766
And I forwarded it to you
like a WhatsApp text.

1349
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:43,033
Why did they wink at you?

1350
01:33:43,066 --> 01:33:46,666
Because 1,00,000 goes
to their personal account.

1351
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:49,600
But why did they wink at you?

1352
01:33:49,733 --> 01:33:51,200
They made an offer to me, as well.

1353
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,666
A cut in the home expenditure.

1354
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,233
Hand me my cane.

1355
01:33:56,533 --> 01:33:57,533
Why?

1356
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:59,200
So, I can beat them up!

1357
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,666
- Let's chase them.
- Uncle please, trust me…

1358
01:34:02,766 --> 01:34:05,000
- What are you doing?
- Yashu…

1359
01:34:05,066 --> 01:34:06,766
- Yashu…
- What's going on here?

1360
01:34:07,066 --> 01:34:10,100
Uncle is beating us up
because of this outsider.

1361
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,300
What happened, Dad?

1362
01:34:11,366 --> 01:34:13,309
These two are siphoning money
from the company account.

1363
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:14,533
They have a share.

1364
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:15,733
Who told you this?

1365
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:19,200
- Him.
- And how do you know he's not lying?

1366
01:34:20,133 --> 01:34:21,366
Because he never lies.

1367
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,400
I see.

1368
01:34:23,633 --> 01:34:25,200
So, you only speak the truth?

1369
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,566
Why will my brother
steal from his own company?

1370
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:32,700
He earns two million every month.

1371
01:34:33,133 --> 01:34:35,533
He spends two million
at the bat of an eyelid on IJL.

1372
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,600
IJL?

1373
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
"Indian Jua League."

1374
01:34:38,066 --> 01:34:39,566
He's the Chris Gayle of IJL.

1375
01:34:40,566 --> 01:34:41,733
Do you gamble?

1376
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,200
Only on weekends.

1377
01:34:44,266 --> 01:34:46,333
- Only on weekends.
- Yeah.

1378
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,033
Because he's busy
with Sheena on weekdays.

1379
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,600
Who is Sheena?

1380
01:34:51,233 --> 01:34:52,133
I don't know.

1381
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,266
Are you guys going
to believe everything he says?

1382
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,266
Sheena sent a text on your phone.

1383
01:34:58,533 --> 01:34:59,533
"Call me once free."

1384
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,720
You dropped it while trying to escape.

1385
01:35:02,133 --> 01:35:04,566
So what? I'll call her when I am free.

1386
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,433
He's creating unwanted controversy.

1387
01:35:07,066 --> 01:35:10,066
I see. In the end, it says,
"Miss you baby."

1388
01:35:10,133 --> 01:35:11,333
- Baby?
- Yes.

1389
01:35:11,566 --> 01:35:13,266
And she also sent a kiss emoji.

1390
01:35:16,366 --> 01:35:17,266
Show me.

1391
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:19,166
Don't, sir.
These pictures are too explicit.

1392
01:35:19,433 --> 01:35:21,000
- Really?
- Yes, his.

1393
01:35:21,233 --> 01:35:25,100
Kiss and heart emojis are so common.

1394
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,733
In fact, uncle,
I even send it to my driver.

1395
01:35:28,133 --> 01:35:29,633
Why are you people overreacting?

1396
01:35:31,366 --> 01:35:33,166
Where were you when
he was doing all this?

1397
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,666
Normally you are always glued to him.

1398
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:38,400
Are women ever going to change?

1399
01:35:38,633 --> 01:35:40,600
When she couldn't slap her husband,

1400
01:35:40,733 --> 01:35:42,566
she slapped her younger brother.

1401
01:35:43,266 --> 01:35:44,366
So outdated, man.

1402
01:35:45,133 --> 01:35:46,133
Bloody leech.

1403
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:50,566
Oh no. Time's up.

1404
01:35:53,033 --> 01:35:54,033
Goodnight, sir.

1405
01:35:55,233 --> 01:35:56,233
Goodnight, madam.

1406
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:03,466
Look, child.

1407
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,000
Don't ask any stupid questions.

1408
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,633
I mean, how did you
get stabbed or where?

1409
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,333
How big was the knife?

1410
01:36:10,433 --> 01:36:12,466
They won't tolerate such small talk.

1411
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,400
- They are rich people.
- Hey, Samara.

1412
01:36:14,466 --> 01:36:16,233
Long time, short skirt. Cute.

1413
01:36:17,766 --> 01:36:18,766
Who is he?

1414
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,233
Dad, this is Bantu.

1415
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,466
My assistant.

1416
01:36:23,466 --> 01:36:24,466
Personal assistant.

1417
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:26,733
But, why is he getting
so personal with you?

1418
01:36:27,066 --> 01:36:29,033
He was looking for the key.

1419
01:36:29,266 --> 01:36:30,666
Here it is. Park the car.

1420
01:36:31,433 --> 01:36:32,700
Haven't told your family yet?

1421
01:36:33,033 --> 01:36:34,033
Told me what?

1422
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:36,100
Your daughter has no interest in Raj.

1423
01:36:36,433 --> 01:36:40,133
- What?
- Actually, we are deeply in love.

1424
01:36:40,433 --> 01:36:41,433
How deep?

1425
01:36:42,533 --> 01:36:43,533
So deep,

1426
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,600
that someday you might have
to get us married, Dad.

1427
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,066
Why is he calling me dad?

1428
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,600
Samara's dad is my dad, as well.

1429
01:36:53,066 --> 01:36:55,366
Come on, Samara.
Always embarrassing me!

1430
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:57,700
Let's go.

1431
01:36:57,766 --> 01:36:58,766
- Blessings?
- Move…

1432
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,660
Keep walking, and don't look back.

1433
01:37:29,333 --> 01:37:30,333
Morning, Inspector.

1434
01:37:30,533 --> 01:37:31,666
Is Jindal sir at home?

1435
01:37:32,033 --> 01:37:33,266
He's gone out.
Anything urgent?

1436
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:36,733
The Commissioner wants to know
whether Randeep needs security?

1437
01:37:37,266 --> 01:37:39,566
He doesn't need any security
as long as I am here.

1438
01:37:42,366 --> 01:37:43,300
Who are you?

1439
01:37:43,366 --> 01:37:44,766
Bantu. I work here.

1440
01:37:45,133 --> 01:37:46,033
What work?

1441
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:47,466
The usual. Bantuka4…

1442
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,100
Netflix and chill on free wifi.

1443
01:37:49,166 --> 01:37:52,000
But who are you to make decisions
about his personal security?

1444
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:58,300
Actually, I am Randeep's real son.

1445
01:38:03,166 --> 01:38:04,166
It's true, sir.

1446
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:06,100
If he's Dhirubhai, I am his Mukesh.

1447
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,666
If he's Mufasa, then I am Simba.

1448
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:09,533
If he's Amrinder, I am Mahinder.

1449
01:38:09,633 --> 01:38:11,166
- Dhoni?
- Bahubali.

1450
01:38:13,733 --> 01:38:14,733
Morning, Officer.

1451
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:16,400
Hello.

1452
01:38:17,233 --> 01:38:18,333
Who is he now?

1453
01:38:19,033 --> 01:38:21,109
For the last 25 years,
they believe that he is their son.

1454
01:38:21,133 --> 01:38:22,133
25 years?

1455
01:38:22,566 --> 01:38:24,033
And when did you find out?

1456
01:38:24,266 --> 01:38:26,100
- Recently.
- How?

1457
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,500
The nurse told me.

1458
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,066
She and the guy hiding behind
the pillar who looks like a pickpocket,

1459
01:38:31,133 --> 01:38:32,766
who's eavesdropping on our conversation…

1460
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,600
Together they swapped me with Raj.

1461
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,400
I got this pathetic life,

1462
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,466
and that avocado became their heir.

1463
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,666
And you saw this with your own eyes?

1464
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,100
No, sir. I was only six hours old then.

1465
01:38:47,166 --> 01:38:48,733
- The nurse told me.
- When?

1466
01:38:49,233 --> 01:38:50,233
Just now.

1467
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,200
Why didn't she tell you this 25 years ago?

1468
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,480
- Because she was in a coma.
- Then why tell you now?

1469
01:38:54,566 --> 01:38:55,676
Because now she woke up from her coma.

1470
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,033
Why did she tell you?

1471
01:38:57,266 --> 01:38:58,200
Who else could she tell?

1472
01:38:58,266 --> 01:38:59,700
Why not tell Mr. Randeep?

1473
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,733
She was going to.

1474
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Then why didn't she?

1475
01:39:02,066 --> 01:39:03,786
Because the poor soul died
before she could.

1476
01:39:15,133 --> 01:39:16,133
Wait a minute.

1477
01:39:16,266 --> 01:39:18,466
Does anyone else know
about this except for you?

1478
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:20,200
Yes, sir. You do.

1479
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:22,433
But I will keep this a secret.

1480
01:39:22,766 --> 01:39:24,033
I will sacrifice.

1481
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:27,333
If you are so big-hearted,
why come here?

1482
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:28,766
This is my house.

1483
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,400
If I don't look out for them,
then who will?

1484
01:39:31,733 --> 01:39:33,000
Bantu, give me the keys.

1485
01:39:34,066 --> 01:39:35,633
I've to get to the office urgently.

1486
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:38,233
See you in the evening. Bye.

1487
01:39:40,366 --> 01:39:41,366
Who is she?

1488
01:39:42,033 --> 01:39:43,133
His fiancée.

1489
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:47,200
<i>If you're happy
And you know it clap your hands</i>

1490
01:39:47,366 --> 01:39:48,633
Why was she kissing you?

1491
01:39:49,033 --> 01:39:50,033
We are in love!

1492
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,460
Does that avocado know about this?

1493
01:39:51,566 --> 01:39:52,566
Come on, sir.

1494
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,400
If he knew, why would he marry her?

1495
01:39:54,466 --> 01:39:57,366
<i>If you're happy
And you know it clap your hands</i>

1496
01:39:57,466 --> 01:39:59,466
Does Mr. Randeep know
what's going on in his house?

1497
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:02,333
We were going to tell him,
but then this happened.

1498
01:40:02,466 --> 01:40:04,026
And because of which, now you are here.

1499
01:40:20,033 --> 01:40:21,400
Good morning, Inspector Yadav.

1500
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:24,666
Sir, do you run background checks
on your employees?

1501
01:40:24,766 --> 01:40:25,766
Of course, we do.

1502
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,166
Then why did you hire him?

1503
01:40:27,433 --> 01:40:29,266
Yadav, this family has everything,

1504
01:40:29,633 --> 01:40:32,033
except for one thing which this boy has.

1505
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,700
What?

1506
01:40:33,766 --> 01:40:36,466
Brains of a businessman,
the courage of a warrior.

1507
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,433
Hope to never see you again.

1508
01:40:43,033 --> 01:40:44,033
This is not your car.

1509
01:40:44,266 --> 01:40:45,533
Okay.

1510
01:40:45,633 --> 01:40:47,433
I guess I will have to resign.

1511
01:40:57,033 --> 01:40:58,353
Thanks for coming in last minute.

1512
01:40:58,433 --> 01:41:02,533
Sir, I know all
the romantic spots in Delhi.

1513
01:41:03,466 --> 01:41:05,500
If madam and you want to go?

1514
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,066
Maybe after dinner. What say, Samara?

1515
01:41:10,466 --> 01:41:13,300
Don't mind,
but you two look cute as a couple.

1516
01:41:14,433 --> 01:41:15,433
Thanks, Bunty.

1517
01:41:16,633 --> 01:41:17,633
Bantu.

1518
01:41:18,533 --> 01:41:20,533
But since you're my boss,
you can call me anything.

1519
01:41:21,433 --> 01:41:24,133
Where do you plan
to stay after the wedding?

1520
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,600
Home or abroad?

1521
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:29,066
Anywhere except for Wuhan!

1522
01:41:31,366 --> 01:41:33,233
- Sir…
- What are you trying to do?

1523
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:35,600
You want me to get married to him?

1524
01:41:36,066 --> 01:41:37,100
That's what you want?

1525
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:39,266
Bantu, I am tired now.

1526
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:42,666
Why are we hiding it
if we haven't done anything wrong?

1527
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,666
Do you both know each other?

1528
01:41:44,733 --> 01:41:45,733
Yeah.

1529
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:48,266
We used to secretly
hold hands in the office.

1530
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:49,466
We played footsie.

1531
01:41:49,533 --> 01:41:52,166
Actually, we are madly in love.
Aren't we?

1532
01:41:53,033 --> 01:41:54,166
Footsie.

1533
01:41:54,466 --> 01:41:56,200
Where did you all play footsie together?

1534
01:41:56,266 --> 01:41:57,642
- When did this happen?
- Wait for a second.

1535
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:58,733
I am talking to you.

1536
01:41:59,533 --> 01:42:00,653
Why don't you say something?

1537
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,100
- How?
- Like this.

1538
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,300
What?

1539
01:42:18,233 --> 01:42:19,676
It's a good thing
the driver didn't show up,

1540
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,733
or I would have never found out.

1541
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:23,633
I am so sorry, Raj.

1542
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,666
We should have told you earlier.

1543
01:42:26,266 --> 01:42:30,233
Actually, we tried to tell you,
but, other things came up.

1544
01:42:31,033 --> 01:42:32,700
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

1545
01:42:33,033 --> 01:42:35,133
Hey, it's alright.

1546
01:42:35,666 --> 01:42:36,666
These things happen.

1547
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:38,633
I have dropped a text to Cadbury.

1548
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,133
He said he's gonna make me
a chocolate milkshake.

1549
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:42,733
Always makes me feel better.

1550
01:42:44,133 --> 01:42:46,366
And you two look nice together.

1551
01:42:46,633 --> 01:42:48,033
I am happy for you guys.

1552
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:49,333
All the best.

1553
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,200
Is that it?

1554
01:42:53,633 --> 01:42:54,633
You are convinced?

1555
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,700
Pardon me.

1556
01:42:57,166 --> 01:42:59,326
You are so easily convinced?
Doesn't this make you mad?

1557
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,133
I don't know.

1558
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:04,300
How could you not know
if you are mad or not?

1559
01:43:04,733 --> 01:43:06,200
That's the problem with rich kids.

1560
01:43:06,366 --> 01:43:07,666
Everyone's confused.

1561
01:43:08,033 --> 01:43:10,633
Either about love, career, or emotions.

1562
01:43:11,033 --> 01:43:13,100
But you cannot be blamed for this,
it's your family.

1563
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:14,642
When you were supposed to ride a cycle,

1564
01:43:14,666 --> 01:43:16,133
they flew you in airplanes.

1565
01:43:16,366 --> 01:43:18,166
Other children went abroad to study,

1566
01:43:18,233 --> 01:43:19,393
you went there for vacations.

1567
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:20,733
Look at yourself.

1568
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:22,533
At home, you're a mama's boy,

1569
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,000
your uncles, and your servants
accompany you to work.

1570
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,766
Your father has no confidence in you.

1571
01:43:27,033 --> 01:43:29,709
And you have nothing in common
with your grandpa except for his surname.

1572
01:43:29,733 --> 01:43:34,400
You use a dinky car to go from one room
to another in your own home.

1573
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,066
But you cannot be blamed for this.

1574
01:43:36,166 --> 01:43:38,300
You demanded one toy,
and you got an entire shop.

1575
01:43:38,433 --> 01:43:40,309
You asked for change,
and they gave you a credit card.

1576
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:42,976
You asked for milk, they gave you <i>Kheer,</i>
that too, with almond milk.

1577
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,233
Now that's nepotism.

1578
01:43:45,566 --> 01:43:46,733
Who are you?

1579
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,360
Don't you have dreams of your own?

1580
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,700
Your fiancée kissed me,

1581
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,133
and you're confused about
whether you are mad or not.

1582
01:43:56,366 --> 01:43:57,366
I am.

1583
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:00,733
I am getting mad.

1584
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,600
Then fight for your identity.

1585
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,733
Attack your family. Take charge.

1586
01:44:05,066 --> 01:44:07,300
Won't look nice if I attack my family.

1587
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,566
Not a real fight.

1588
01:44:08,733 --> 01:44:10,766
Show him who the real Raj is.

1589
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:13,133
- Mom.
- Are you asking for chocolate?

1590
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:15,133
- Dad!
- Think bigger.

1591
01:44:15,566 --> 01:44:17,366
- Granddad!
- Lose respect.

1592
01:44:17,533 --> 01:44:18,466
Grandpa!

1593
01:44:18,533 --> 01:44:20,266
- Little more.
- Jindal.

1594
01:44:20,366 --> 01:44:21,700
You are Sunny not Bobby.

1595
01:44:21,766 --> 01:44:24,333
- Jindal…
- Now you are Dharmendra.

1596
01:44:24,433 --> 01:44:28,766
Bloody Jindal!

1597
01:44:37,733 --> 01:44:39,633
- What happened, my son?
- This…

1598
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:43,133
This love is how you
snatched away my personality.

1599
01:44:43,300 --> 01:44:45,566
Life is so comfortable
that I hardly have any problems.

1600
01:44:45,733 --> 01:44:47,066
So, what is the problem?

1601
01:44:47,433 --> 01:44:49,733
- What's the name of your grandfather?
- Kishenchand.

1602
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,633
Bloody Kishenchand's son.

1603
01:44:52,033 --> 01:44:54,000
Hey, Kishenchand's grandson!

1604
01:44:54,266 --> 01:44:56,466
How would you feel
if someone addressed you like this?

1605
01:44:57,066 --> 01:44:58,200
What rude behavior is this?

1606
01:44:58,433 --> 01:45:01,366
I has been facing this all my life.

1607
01:45:01,566 --> 01:45:02,566
"I have."

1608
01:45:03,066 --> 01:45:04,066
Funny.

1609
01:45:04,666 --> 01:45:06,566
See? Even my Hindi is bad.

1610
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:07,700
My immunity is low.

1611
01:45:07,766 --> 01:45:09,566
All I have is virtual friends.

1612
01:45:09,633 --> 01:45:11,266
And this is your fault.

1613
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:12,766
What is wrong with you?

1614
01:45:13,066 --> 01:45:14,433
My eyes have opened, Mom.

1615
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,600
Thanks to Bunty.

1616
01:45:17,733 --> 01:45:20,566
Grandpa was the only one
who asked me what I want to be.

1617
01:45:20,766 --> 01:45:22,666
When I said I want to be a chef,

1618
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,500
you guys said "Aww, so cute"
and laughed at me.

1619
01:45:27,066 --> 01:45:29,600
I wanted to try photography,
and be a pilot.

1620
01:45:30,033 --> 01:45:31,466
But son, you can't be everything.

1621
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,233
But I can try.

1622
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:36,466
But you guys are so rich,

1623
01:45:36,533 --> 01:45:38,633
you didn't give me a chance to struggle.

1624
01:45:39,466 --> 01:45:42,633
Because if I failed,
you guys would be embarrassed.

1625
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:48,733
Mom, if I had topped the university,

1626
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,400
what would I be?

1627
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:53,133
The Jindal Group's CEO.

1628
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:57,000
And what if I had returned
without a degree?

1629
01:46:00,233 --> 01:46:02,533
- The Jindal Group's CEO.
- Exactly.

1630
01:46:02,633 --> 01:46:06,400
I've been noticing all my life.
You guys know how to give orders, not ask.

1631
01:46:06,566 --> 01:46:10,166
No one asked Samara if she wants
to even marry me or not.

1632
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,500
You just said she should
be happy with my decision.

1633
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,766
My decision!

1634
01:46:14,033 --> 01:46:16,200
Hello! She loves Bunty.

1635
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,266
Samara and Bantu?

1636
01:46:18,433 --> 01:46:21,033
Yes, they have been having an affair,
and you know what, honestly,

1637
01:46:21,133 --> 01:46:22,366
I am happy for them.

1638
01:46:23,266 --> 01:46:24,466
I was sinning.

1639
01:46:25,366 --> 01:46:26,566
I am not a love breaker, Mom.

1640
01:46:28,766 --> 01:46:30,633
From now on I'll make my own decisions!

1641
01:46:31,466 --> 01:46:32,466
Hope that's okay.

1642
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,100
Cadbury, get me your finest scotch.

1643
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,200
Yes, master Raj.

1644
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,066
Your Raj has grown up.

1645
01:46:49,433 --> 01:46:53,400
You're smoking cigarettes in the garden
after canceling my son's wedding!

1646
01:46:53,566 --> 01:46:55,500
They were all mine, to begin with.

1647
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:57,500
As for your son,

1648
01:46:57,666 --> 01:47:01,166
if I tell everyone the truth,
he will be kicked out.

1649
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:02,400
Kicked out.

1650
01:47:03,366 --> 01:47:07,366
His mother will become his boss,
his father his CEO,

1651
01:47:07,433 --> 01:47:09,733
and an ordinary servant
like you will become his father.

1652
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:12,133
Rascal!

1653
01:47:12,766 --> 01:47:13,766
Me?

1654
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,300
You are a rascal, Valmiki.

1655
01:47:17,066 --> 01:47:18,300
Bloody child swapper!

1656
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,033
Don't spoil my mood. Get lost.

1657
01:47:22,766 --> 01:47:24,500
Out. Out.

1658
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,633
Your beauty is going
to peak in the next two years.

1659
01:47:35,433 --> 01:47:37,433
Oh, stop it!
Is that what you see here?

1660
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:38,733
Do you go to the gym?

1661
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:41,133
Yes? True Fitness.

1662
01:47:41,266 --> 01:47:43,633
You are going to find
true love in True Fitness.

1663
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,166
Do you know anyone with
a big heart and bigger biceps?

1664
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,200
Yes.

1665
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:51,700
Jatin.

1666
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:53,300
My trainer.

1667
01:47:53,466 --> 01:47:56,366
He was Mr. Vasant Vihar.

1668
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:58,366
Very soon he will pop the question.

1669
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:01,066
- What?
- Shall we go…

1670
01:48:01,566 --> 01:48:03,566
away from this Mount Kailash?

1671
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,533
In the valley of my biceps.

1672
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:08,400
Are you blushing?

1673
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:09,700
Stop this nonsense!

1674
01:48:09,766 --> 01:48:12,333
- This Bantu will ruin my marriage.
- No!

1675
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,466
He is a home breaker.

1676
01:48:13,533 --> 01:48:15,433
No, that's not it.

1677
01:48:15,633 --> 01:48:16,633
And who is Jatin?

1678
01:48:16,666 --> 01:48:19,133
Jatin is my trainer…

1679
01:48:20,766 --> 01:48:21,766
Read.

1680
01:48:22,733 --> 01:48:25,466
That's all for today. Come with me.

1681
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,166
No, Dad. Go ahead.

1682
01:48:28,466 --> 01:48:30,166
I don't need to see your hand.

1683
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,766
- It's all written on your face.
- What?

1684
01:48:34,366 --> 01:48:36,300
You don't get along with your husband.

1685
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:45,300
Come, Bantu. Get up.

1686
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:46,666
Come.

1687
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:49,200
Wait, Dad.

1688
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,666
Why do you feel that way?

1689
01:48:51,433 --> 01:48:53,700
The doors of your room are always closed.

1690
01:48:54,233 --> 01:48:55,273
Why are you so interested?

1691
01:48:55,433 --> 01:48:57,509
Whether their doors are closed or not?
How does it matter to you?

1692
01:48:57,533 --> 01:49:00,500
When the couple is newly married,
one can understand.

1693
01:49:01,033 --> 01:49:02,333
There is much to talk about.

1694
01:49:03,233 --> 01:49:06,266
But if the doors remain
closed after 30 years of marriage.

1695
01:49:06,466 --> 01:49:08,033
That means there is silence inside.

1696
01:49:08,566 --> 01:49:09,766
Regardless of how busy sir is,

1697
01:49:10,433 --> 01:49:12,200
he makes it a point to return by 6.

1698
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:16,333
To prove that this family
means everything to him.

1699
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,233
But he does this, not by will,

1700
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,166
but out of guilt.

1701
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,033
What guilt?

1702
01:49:29,466 --> 01:49:30,466
Ayesha.

1703
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,633
He had an affair seven years ago.

1704
01:49:39,133 --> 01:49:41,093
And since then you two
have been living like this.

1705
01:49:41,166 --> 01:49:43,433
You don't want to fix
the relationship or part ways.

1706
01:49:43,733 --> 01:49:45,633
Unfortunately, everyone knows about it,

1707
01:49:46,066 --> 01:49:47,766
but no one wants to talk about it.

1708
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,066
Why? Because you fear society.

1709
01:49:50,233 --> 01:49:52,366
Buddy, you could have said something.

1710
01:49:52,466 --> 01:49:54,466
Or at least get them divorced.

1711
01:49:59,766 --> 01:50:00,766
What do you think?

1712
01:50:01,733 --> 01:50:03,533
Telling the truth will make you great!

1713
01:50:04,133 --> 01:50:06,200
If a lie can save someone's life,

1714
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:07,566
it's better than the truth.

1715
01:50:08,233 --> 01:50:10,033
If you ever love someone,

1716
01:50:10,566 --> 01:50:12,366
you will know how important a lie is.

1717
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:15,333
The true strength
of love lies in honesty.

1718
01:50:16,733 --> 01:50:18,166
Try telling the truth, sir.

1719
01:50:19,266 --> 01:50:20,433
It will be painful,

1720
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:22,720
but it will fortify your relationship.

1721
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:39,233
It's six o'clock, sir.
My time is up.

1722
01:50:41,033 --> 01:50:42,033
Goodnight.

1723
01:51:21,466 --> 01:51:23,100
It wasn't her fault.

1724
01:51:24,633 --> 01:51:25,633
It was yours.

1725
01:51:28,333 --> 01:51:29,566
You were married.

1726
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,366
You had a family.

1727
01:51:37,233 --> 01:51:38,533
And what was my fault?

1728
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,766
That I always gave my best
to this relationship?

1729
01:51:47,166 --> 01:51:48,433
For the sake of our love,

1730
01:51:49,466 --> 01:51:50,733
I went against my father.

1731
01:51:52,766 --> 01:51:54,126
I fought against the entire world.

1732
01:51:56,066 --> 01:51:57,733
And you broke my heart in return.

1733
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:08,666
Guilt alone doesn't pardon your mistake.

1734
01:52:10,066 --> 01:52:11,466
You have to apologize for that.

1735
01:52:13,766 --> 01:52:14,766
Randeep,

1736
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,266
you couldn't even
say sorry in seven years.

1737
01:52:21,066 --> 01:52:22,333
Don't you think I deserve that?

1738
01:52:29,733 --> 01:52:32,266
I was ashamed to look you in the eye.

1739
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:35,433
To talk to you.

1740
01:52:38,133 --> 01:52:40,033
I was ashamed of myself.

1741
01:52:44,133 --> 01:52:45,700
It took me long enough, isn't it Yashu?

1742
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,033
Forgive me.

1743
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:54,466
I am sorry.

1744
01:53:09,066 --> 01:53:10,066
Hello.

1745
01:53:10,633 --> 01:53:12,700
Why isn't my daughter reacting?

1746
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,100
They fought for seven years.

1747
01:53:15,466 --> 01:53:16,666
Give them five minutes.

1748
01:53:19,033 --> 01:53:20,033
I am sorry.

1749
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,266
I am so sorry.

1750
01:53:31,533 --> 01:53:32,600
I am sorry, Yashu.

1751
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:45,600
They are hugging, buddy.

1752
01:53:47,533 --> 01:53:49,000
Congratulations, buddy.

1753
01:53:49,633 --> 01:53:52,766
Get some rest
and let me have my dinner in peace.

1754
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:12,500
Cadbury, what brings you here?

1755
01:54:12,566 --> 01:54:13,666
Good morning, Bantu.

1756
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,200
All good?

1757
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,566
Jindal sir sent this for you.

1758
01:54:18,733 --> 01:54:22,400
Said he'll be very glad
if you can attend.

1759
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:26,066
Don't be late.

1760
01:54:43,533 --> 01:54:46,166
COME HOME

1761
01:54:53,333 --> 01:55:00,200
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1762
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:07,566
<i>Your mischiefs bring me joy</i>

1763
01:55:08,633 --> 01:55:15,066
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1764
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:22,733
<i>Your mischiefs bring me joy</i>

1765
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:33,233
<i>Everyone's here</i>

1766
01:55:33,333 --> 01:55:35,133
<i>Looking elegant</i>

1767
01:55:35,266 --> 01:55:40,066
<i>Make every heart skip a beat</i>

1768
01:55:41,066 --> 01:55:42,066
<i>Oh, yes</i>

1769
01:55:43,033 --> 01:55:46,533
<i>Climbing over the walls
The boys are here</i>

1770
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:51,466
<i>Glow like the moon
And light up the night</i>

1771
01:55:54,466 --> 01:55:56,366
<i>Every moment</i>

1772
01:55:56,566 --> 01:56:02,100
<i>I don't spend with you is a waste</i>

1773
01:56:02,166 --> 01:56:08,000
<i>When you held my hand
Leaving the world behind</i>

1774
01:56:08,166 --> 01:56:10,200
<i>It gave me an overwhelming feeling</i>

1775
01:56:10,266 --> 01:56:16,300
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1776
01:56:18,033 --> 01:56:24,333
<i>Your mischiefs bring me joy</i>

1777
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,033
<i>The things you do</i>

1778
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:32,033
<i>Tickle my heart</i>

1779
01:56:32,766 --> 01:56:36,433
<i>Your mischiefs</i>

1780
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:39,733
<i>Bring me joy</i>

1781
01:56:41,066 --> 01:56:44,233
<i>Believe me when I say
That I prayed</i>

1782
01:56:44,333 --> 01:56:49,266
<i>The dreams of my loved ones to come true</i>

1783
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:57,666
<i>Every breath I take,
Is another praise for you</i>

1784
01:56:58,133 --> 01:56:59,633
<i>There is no dearth of it</i>

1785
01:56:59,700 --> 01:57:05,500
<i>Since I've been blessed with your love</i>

1786
01:57:05,633 --> 01:57:07,666
<i>It gave me an overwhelming feeling</i>

1787
01:57:07,733 --> 01:57:14,100
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1788
01:57:15,533 --> 01:57:22,100
<i>Your mischiefs bring me joy</i>

1789
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:29,466
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1790
01:57:30,433 --> 01:57:37,433
<i>Your mischiefs bring me joy</i>

1791
01:57:38,166 --> 01:57:41,500
<i>I want to ward off the evil eyes</i>

1792
01:57:41,666 --> 01:57:45,433
<i>Of the apple of my eyes</i>

1793
01:57:45,666 --> 01:57:48,766
<i>I can't stand it</i>

1794
01:57:49,033 --> 01:57:52,766
<i>If any harm comes to them</i>

1795
01:57:53,666 --> 01:58:00,466
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1796
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:07,600
<i>Your mischiefs bring me joy</i>

1797
01:58:08,533 --> 01:58:15,500
<i>The things you do tickle my heart</i>

1798
01:58:32,266 --> 01:58:37,333
<i>The auspicious evening has arrived</i>

1799
01:58:38,266 --> 01:58:43,466
<i>But I am a little scared</i>

1800
01:58:44,233 --> 01:58:48,266
<i>If this evening comes to an end</i>

1801
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,433
<i>I will die</i>

1802
01:59:23,733 --> 01:59:24,733
Hello, aunty.

1803
01:59:25,333 --> 01:59:26,333
Shall we?

1804
01:59:37,766 --> 01:59:39,133
<i>I am fed up now.</i>

1805
01:59:39,466 --> 01:59:41,266
<i>All I wanted was a simple signature</i>

1806
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:43,333
<i>so that my men could return to work.</i>

1807
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:44,700
<i>Now sign the documents,</i>

1808
01:59:45,366 --> 01:59:47,500
<i>and send your son over
to the location I sent you.</i>

1809
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,466
<i>Along with shares worth 50 billion.</i>

1810
01:59:51,566 --> 01:59:53,233
<i>This is an old cliched threat.</i>

1811
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:55,500
<i>But if you call the police,</i>

1812
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:59,133
<i>you will never see your wife again.</i>

1813
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:08,533
Raj, you won't go.

1814
02:00:09,066 --> 02:00:10,733
This is risky.
I will deal with him.

1815
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,733
- Give it to me.
- Dad, I will go!

1816
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:15,300
I can do this.

1817
02:00:16,266 --> 02:00:17,266
Raj,

1818
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,000
he is right.

1819
02:00:19,366 --> 02:00:21,566
A man like Sarang cannot be trusted.

1820
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:24,200
You are naive, son.

1821
02:00:24,433 --> 02:00:26,766
You know nothing about the real world.

1822
02:00:27,033 --> 02:00:29,500
All I know is when it's about my mother,

1823
02:00:29,633 --> 02:00:32,200
we don't discuss, we act.

1824
02:00:56,033 --> 02:00:57,033
Where is my mother?

1825
02:01:00,666 --> 02:01:01,666
What happened here?

1826
02:01:02,166 --> 02:01:04,000
The breeze was blowing slowly.

1827
02:01:05,066 --> 02:01:07,633
Old songs were playing on the radio.

1828
02:01:08,566 --> 02:01:11,366
My boss was preparing
to leave the country.

1829
02:01:12,033 --> 02:01:14,233
His brother was drinking on the rocks.

1830
02:01:14,633 --> 02:01:16,733
The guys were busy playing cards.

1831
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,133
With great expectations,
we were looking at the gate.

1832
02:01:22,366 --> 02:01:24,766
Everything was going as planned.

1833
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,066
In the next 15 minutes,

1834
02:01:27,133 --> 02:01:29,700
we were supposed
to receive shares worth 50 billion.

1835
02:01:30,466 --> 02:01:31,500
And then…

1836
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,333
The wind turned violent.

1837
02:01:35,166 --> 02:01:36,766
Songs became muffled.

1838
02:01:37,633 --> 02:01:39,233
We were hit by a storm.

1839
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:41,566
A hurricane!

1840
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:57,233
I am worried.

1841
02:01:58,233 --> 02:02:00,200
We shouldn't have let Raj go alone.

1842
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:01,333
He will be fine.

1843
02:02:56,433 --> 02:02:58,166
<i>The prince</i>

1844
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:41,200
So silky.

1845
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:42,600
Which shampoo do you use?

1846
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:10,233
You little back alley rodent.

1847
02:04:10,633 --> 02:04:12,433
You always show up to defend this family.

1848
02:04:12,633 --> 02:04:14,273
What is your relationship
with this woman?

1849
02:04:14,366 --> 02:04:16,000
A child's first home,

1850
02:04:16,633 --> 02:04:18,233
a boy's first love.

1851
02:04:19,066 --> 02:04:21,233
The most pious relationship
in the whole world.

1852
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,100
What?

1853
02:04:23,166 --> 02:04:25,200
Don't ask questions
in the middle of the action.

1854
02:04:53,366 --> 02:04:55,233
Oh no, just missed it.

1855
02:05:01,033 --> 02:05:03,166
Why do you carry an umbrella
all the time, brother?

1856
02:05:05,233 --> 02:05:06,266
Now you made a mess.

1857
02:05:06,433 --> 02:05:08,033
Who is this, Bantu?

1858
02:05:08,366 --> 02:05:09,666
Where did he come from?

1859
02:05:10,466 --> 02:05:12,266
No one knows.

1860
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,133
He blew away the guys

1861
02:05:15,166 --> 02:05:17,133
and our expectations!

1862
02:05:39,266 --> 02:05:41,633
I brought him home
because I knew the truth.

1863
02:05:42,366 --> 02:05:43,566
He is your son

1864
02:05:45,533 --> 02:05:47,400
and the heir to Aditya Jindal.

1865
02:05:54,266 --> 02:05:56,433
I thought he will tell the truth
to get this house,

1866
02:05:57,166 --> 02:05:59,533
the money, and the business.

1867
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,000
But no…

1868
02:06:02,066 --> 02:06:03,266
he doesn't want anything.

1869
02:06:20,266 --> 02:06:21,266
Valmiki,

1870
02:06:21,733 --> 02:06:23,100
do you have anything to say?

1871
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:25,400
Nothing, sir.

1872
02:06:26,266 --> 02:06:28,766
In case my son has unintentionally
made any mistakes,

1873
02:06:29,300 --> 02:06:31,066
please forgive him.

1874
02:06:31,266 --> 02:06:32,266
That's all.

1875
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:35,600
Is that all?

1876
02:06:35,766 --> 02:06:36,766
Yes, sir.

1877
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:40,700
That's all?

1878
02:06:52,433 --> 02:06:53,566
Is that all, Valmiki?

1879
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:55,200
Is it?

1880
02:06:55,666 --> 02:06:57,133
He is my grandson.

1881
02:06:59,166 --> 02:07:00,166
My blood.

1882
02:07:01,566 --> 02:07:02,700
He is my successor!

1883
02:07:05,033 --> 02:07:07,566
You took him away from us
and now you're choosing to keep mum.

1884
02:07:10,466 --> 02:07:13,400
I heard the nurse talking
to him in the hospital.

1885
02:07:24,133 --> 02:07:25,766
Ever since I found out what you did,

1886
02:07:26,133 --> 02:07:27,766
I have controlled myself.

1887
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:30,166
Why didn't you get mad?

1888
02:07:31,166 --> 02:07:32,166
I pity him.

1889
02:07:34,466 --> 02:07:37,333
He has two sons,
but no one to call him father.

1890
02:07:39,300 --> 02:07:41,500
The joy of swapping
the children soon turned into fear.

1891
02:07:43,333 --> 02:07:45,500
He hasn't slept peacefully
for last 25 years.

1892
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Let him go, sir.

1893
02:07:49,033 --> 02:07:50,500
You aren't upset with any of us.

1894
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:51,633
You have no greed.

1895
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:53,266
Then why come here?

1896
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:56,280
Parents are not the only ones
who wish happiness for their children.

1897
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:00,633
Children want to see
their parents happy, as well.

1898
02:08:02,566 --> 02:08:04,700
But when a mother
has been deprived of joy,

1899
02:08:06,166 --> 02:08:07,733
how can a son be happy?

1900
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:10,766
As long as I am here,

1901
02:08:11,366 --> 02:08:14,166
how can I see my father weak?

1902
02:08:16,366 --> 02:08:18,433
How can I see my grandpa in pain?

1903
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:23,033
When I realized that you guys
are going through a difficult time,

1904
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:27,333
I couldn't just stand by.

1905
02:08:30,333 --> 02:08:32,766
Those who abused my
father behind his back

1906
02:08:33,666 --> 02:08:35,700
will fall at his feet.

1907
02:08:37,166 --> 02:08:40,533
My mother will be his best friend.

1908
02:08:41,633 --> 02:08:45,133
Randeep can never lose
and I won't let him.

1909
02:08:46,366 --> 02:08:47,733
I came here

1910
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,133
to turn this place into a real paradise.

1911
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,466
My job here is done.

1912
02:08:53,366 --> 02:08:54,646
I don't want anything else, sir.

1913
02:09:12,566 --> 02:09:14,000
I told you…

1914
02:09:16,566 --> 02:09:19,033
I told you how my son will be.

1915
02:09:24,033 --> 02:09:25,533
Just like him.

1916
02:09:31,533 --> 02:09:32,666
Exactly like him.

1917
02:09:35,533 --> 02:09:36,533
Exactly like him.

1918
02:09:41,733 --> 02:09:43,233
Sir, please calm down.

1919
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,700
Calm down.

1920
02:09:51,033 --> 02:09:52,400
Calm down, Dad.

1921
02:10:03,133 --> 02:10:04,133
Say that again.

1922
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:06,400
Dad.

1923
02:10:07,766 --> 02:10:09,266
Calm down, please.

1924
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,633
Come on, let's go see Yashu.

1925
02:10:34,166 --> 02:10:36,166
- Let's tell Yashu.
- No.

1926
02:10:38,166 --> 02:10:39,166
Don't do that.

1927
02:10:40,466 --> 02:10:41,466
What about Raj?

1928
02:10:42,533 --> 02:10:43,600
What will you tell him?

1929
02:10:46,033 --> 02:10:49,133
Twenty-five years ago he separated
two children from their mother.

1930
02:10:50,566 --> 02:10:53,566
Rectifying this mistake will
separate another mother and son again.

1931
02:10:57,033 --> 02:10:58,666
As your son, I request you.

1932
02:11:00,366 --> 02:11:01,846
Please don't break my mother's heart.

1933
02:11:27,333 --> 02:11:28,333
Bantu,

1934
02:11:29,233 --> 02:11:31,600
you are one reality I don't like.

1935
02:11:32,266 --> 02:11:34,233
Because you are better than my son.

1936
02:11:34,666 --> 02:11:38,300
Women can accept
a stranger as their husband.

1937
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:42,433
But their children can only
be the ones they give birth to.

1938
02:11:43,466 --> 02:11:44,466
Today

1939
02:11:45,366 --> 02:11:46,766
when you arrived instead of Raj,

1940
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:48,366
you not only saved me…

1941
02:11:49,266 --> 02:11:50,633
but him, as well.

1942
02:11:51,500 --> 02:11:53,633
And anyone who protects

1943
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,533
and defends my family

1944
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,200
is just like a son to me.

1945
02:12:36,566 --> 02:12:37,600
Thank you, Bunty.

1946
02:12:40,433 --> 02:12:41,500
Did I do the right thing?

1947
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,133
You always do the right thing.

1948
02:12:46,500 --> 02:12:47,500
What happened, Valmiki?

1949
02:12:48,233 --> 02:12:49,400
Why do you look stressed?

1950
02:12:49,566 --> 02:12:50,733
You should be happy.

1951
02:12:51,233 --> 02:12:53,266
Your son has made you proud.

1952
02:12:56,100 --> 02:12:59,100
What years of foreign education
couldn't teach Raj,

1953
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:02,366
you taught it to Bantu
in the old alleys of Delhi.

1954
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:08,100
Make my Raj just like your Bantu.

1955
02:13:09,066 --> 02:13:10,733
Let him start from scratch.

1956
02:13:11,333 --> 02:13:12,766
In fact, let him stay with you.

1957
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:14,700
And, in the next five years,

1958
02:13:15,733 --> 02:13:17,633
transform him from a clerk to the CEO.

1959
02:13:46,566 --> 02:13:47,566
It hasn't arrived yet?

1960
02:13:52,066 --> 02:13:53,500
I guess the bus is running late.

1961
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:07,733
When I was a kid,
you frenziedly told me stories.

1962
02:14:09,333 --> 02:14:11,373
But your lap was the only place
I could fall asleep.

1963
02:14:12,733 --> 02:14:14,400
You can't walk properly,

1964
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,066
but you taught me to sprint.

1965
02:14:20,133 --> 02:14:23,533
My grandpa simply loves
my rude personality,

1966
02:14:25,533 --> 02:14:26,766
and it's all thanks to you.

1967
02:14:30,233 --> 02:14:31,833
They may have brought me
into this world,

1968
02:14:34,666 --> 02:14:36,166
but you raised me.

1969
02:14:38,166 --> 02:14:40,133
Was it a compliment or sarcasm?

1970
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,520
I learned that from you, as well.

1971
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:44,466
Compliment wrapped in sarcasm.

1972
02:14:45,466 --> 02:14:49,300
The Jindal family grandson's
riding a scooter.

1973
02:14:49,766 --> 02:14:53,400
It's 125cc. Gives the best mileage.

1974
02:14:53,466 --> 02:14:56,546
And one doesn't have to worry about
changing gears. What else can one ask for?

1975
02:14:57,266 --> 02:14:59,433
Good for you!

1976
02:15:03,233 --> 02:15:04,233
It's not mine.

1977
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
It's yours.

1978
02:15:49,133 --> 02:15:50,433
Mister, can I get a lift?

1979
02:15:50,666 --> 02:15:51,946
We are headed to the same place.

1980
02:15:53,466 --> 02:15:54,466
Wait.

1981
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,500
Valmiki take a left and right
and stop at the food stall.

1982
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,533
We'll have an egg wrap
on our way home.

1983
02:16:00,766 --> 02:16:03,766
The chickens are going to curse you.
How many eggs are you going to eat?

1984
02:16:04,033 --> 02:16:06,666
Wow! You swapped their son,
and didn't get cursed,

1985
02:16:06,733 --> 02:16:08,333
why will I get cursed for eating eggs?
