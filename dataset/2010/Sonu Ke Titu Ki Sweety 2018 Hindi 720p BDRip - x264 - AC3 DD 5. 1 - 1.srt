1
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,547
"You get me Golden earrings."

2
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:18,963
"I'll kiss them and
wear them in my ears."

3
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,380
"You get me Golden earrings"

4
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,797
"I'll kiss them and
wear them in my ears."

5
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,255
"You get me Golden earrings"

6
00:02:28,297 --> 00:02:30,630
"I'll kiss them and
wear them in my ears."

7
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,130
"Please agree,"
You call this an arrangement?

8
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,932
"Take me shopping.."
Everything is so dull.

9
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,085
Our reputation is at stake.

10
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,731
All the guests are
just eating and leaving.

11
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:39,731
At this pace, by the time the ceremony
starts, there will be no guests left.

12
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:41,481
How can you blame the
arrangements for that, sir?

13
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,297
Did I ask you to invite boring people?

14
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:46,630
If your guests are irresponsible
and don't care about your respect.

15
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:47,880
How is it my fault?

16
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,755
The DJ is blasting his speakers.

17
00:02:49,797 --> 00:02:51,273
New, old English,
he's got all kinds of songs.

18
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,023
But it is your guests
who have to dance, right?

19
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,130
This is neither a movie
nor am I Ranveer Singh..

20
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,797
To start dancing at your wedding.

21
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:59,422
Imagine how stupid I
will look dancing over here.

22
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,880
The wedding got delayed
because of the beautician.

23
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:03,356
Because at the last
moment Pinky decided..

24
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,523
To go for the platinum
package instead of the gold one.

25
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:06,630
How is that my fault now?

26
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:09,130
We have planned everything
according to the gold package.

27
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,273
Tell me if there is anything
lacking in my arrangements.

28
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:13,463
Sir, we are running out of plates.

29
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,380
What do you mean?

30
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:16,255
Uncle...

31
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,380
Your relatives sons
are standing right there.

32
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:20,648
I asked them to count before
I placed the plates there.

33
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:24,672
It was you who thought that 700 plates
would be enough for 1200 guests.

34
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,505
Others will only hog on snacks.

35
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:27,547
Now make them eat snacks.

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,755
Okay, don't look so distressed.

37
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,672
I will place some more.

38
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,273
But I will charge
400 per plate for these.

39
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,297
400 per plate?

40
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:36,713
What kind of a person are you?

41
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:39,629
I am charging you 400 instead
of 1400 at the time of your need.

42
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,670
If it were someone else,
he would have charged 2000.

43
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:53,130
What now?

44
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:01,005
Sonu!

45
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:05,630
Sonu...

46
00:04:46,797 --> 00:04:47,880
Sonu, Pihu...

47
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:49,797
Is she dead?

48
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,047
Why are you saying that?

49
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,255
I am already crying.

50
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:53,672
Did I make you cry?

51
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,172
You can at least stop me.

52
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:56,005
For what?

53
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,255
She'll just make you cry again.

54
00:04:58,422 --> 00:04:59,481
She should make you cry,
I should make you stop.

55
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:00,380
She should make you cry,
I should make you stop.

56
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:01,523
She should make you cry,
I should make you stop.

57
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:02,921
This girl has this vicious
circle going forever!

58
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:04,630
There is a limit to being stupid!

59
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:07,322
We have been doing nothing
but this since the past two years.

60
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,797
You started crying on
the first month anniversary...

61
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,122
And you still haven't stopped.

62
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:12,338
She didn't do anything.

63
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:13,922
It is my fault.

64
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,672
What an...

65
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,630
What's your fault?

66
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,630
I checked her Tinder account.

67
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,297
You checked her Tinder account,
that's the issue?

68
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:26,047
I apologized to her as well.

69
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:29,172
But she feels that I
don't respect her privacy.

70
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:30,422
And that I doubt her.

71
00:05:30,922 --> 00:05:32,630
Please talk to her.

72
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:36,088
You fool, why does she have
Tinder account in the first place?

73
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:37,255
How does that matter?

74
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:38,422
Talk to her, please.

75
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:43,047
I swear, if you weren't
my childhood friend..

76
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:45,130
I would have disowned you long back.

77
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,242
How did you become such an idiot?

78
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:51,046
People become blind in love,
not stupid in love.

79
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,130
I mean, how?

80
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,922
I don't even control myself
as much as she controls you.

81
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:59,797
From your food, to clothes,
even our toothpaste is of her choice!

82
00:05:59,922 --> 00:06:01,922
We have been using
Colgate since childhood..

83
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:02,797
And now because of
her "herbal" nonsense.

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,755
My mouth tastes like mud all day.

85
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,797
She takes care of us.

86
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,755
Otherwise,
you know how I hog at the shop.

87
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:12,273
That's grandpa's Kurta, isn't it?

88
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:13,213
Yeah, I flicked it.

89
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:14,255
It's nice, right?

90
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Get more Kachoris.

91
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:16,505
Okay, sir.

92
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:18,505
It's very nice.

93
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:20,672
You should wear such Kurtas,
grandpa types.

94
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,047
Why wear t-shirts?

95
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,810
They'll have good fit,
make you look young.

96
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,130
Yuck!

97
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,838
Shouldn't we just eat Kachoris instead?

98
00:06:26,922 --> 00:06:27,922
Listen...

99
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,380
Also get Jalebis for him.

100
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:30,505
Okay, ma'am.

101
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,297
This is how she takes care?

102
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,588
She could have mentioned
health or cholesterol.

103
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,590
She could have said that
you'd get a heart attack.

104
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:39,922
But no, she isn't worried
about your health.

105
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:42,505
She is more worried that
if she's seen around with a fat guy..

106
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:44,005
Then her image will get ruined.

107
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,672
Hmm?

108
00:06:50,047 --> 00:06:51,297
But it means the same.

109
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:52,872
There is way of saying things.

110
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,922
Those who have to take
care don't taunt to do so.

111
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:58,797
She manipulates under the
disguise of taking care of you, Titu.

112
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,297
She is not at all manipulative.

113
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,505
Don't make me say it.

114
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,422
I didn't want to go that way,
but let's go there as well.

115
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:12,297
'Scoundrels, no one at the
police station could find my uniform?'

116
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:12,963
'Shame on you!'

117
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:13,922
'Sir, you are the one who is naked.'

118
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:15,165
'Why should we feel ashamed?'

119
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:18,505
'Bloodshot eyes and an officer...'

120
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,922
- He means...
- Please.

121
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:21,547
I'm glad I don't understand.

122
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,731
She grew up in Jalandhar, right?

123
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,856
She attended college in Delhi.

124
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,231
Then how can she not know Punjabi?

125
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:26,421
She understands Honey
Singh perfectly well.

126
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:27,856
But she scrunches her nose
when it comes to Malkit Singh.

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,630
It is all a pretense, Titu.

128
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,797
I am telling you, she is a liar.

129
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,630
And that day...

130
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:42,672
Which day?

131
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:44,630
You know very well know which day.

132
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:45,505
Not that.

133
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:46,505
Don't go there.

134
00:07:46,547 --> 00:07:47,172
Why not?

135
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:48,825
Because you know that I am right?

136
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:50,875
You will have to come along.

137
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,672
Come on.

138
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,130
Come on!

139
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:54,505
Hi.

140
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,505
Hey, hi.

141
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:56,587
- How are you?
- What's up!

142
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,297
Good, good...

143
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:58,422
My friend Sonu.

144
00:07:58,797 --> 00:07:59,547
Hi, Anshul.

145
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,797
My friend Titu.

146
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,255
Hi, Anshul.

147
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:03,297
What's up!

148
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,005
And... how are you?

149
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,422
Not too bad. You were leaving?

150
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:06,672
No.

151
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:15,547
You know why a girl Introduces
her boyfriend as a friend, right?

152
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:17,922
Don't say anything.

153
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:20,922
I am not saying anything.

154
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,755
Now her Instagram will do the talking.

155
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,047
Where are you in this?

156
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:32,255
Where?

157
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:33,047
Tell me.

158
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,422
Yeah?

159
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:36,672
Where?

160
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:38,047
Just show it to me.

161
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:39,547
I will shut up.

162
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:42,755
You have even given
her the keys to the shop.

163
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,047
She also knows the
code of the cash counter.

164
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,550
And she doesn't let you
check her Tinder account?

165
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:48,922
So, what should I do?

166
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,505
What do you mean by, what should I do?

167
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:51,547
End it!

168
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,477
Call her up and ask
her to return the keys.

169
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,755
I will change the code.

170
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,380
I should break up
over such a small thing?

171
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,755
Small thing?

172
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,296
In two years, 24 months, 104 weeks...

173
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:04,005
She has made you cry for a 102 weeks.

174
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,505
What kind of a relationship averages
one week of happiness per year?

175
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,463
We don't need it, bro we don't need it.

176
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:12,213
It is not like that, Sonu.

177
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:13,297
Things will get better.

178
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,922
Look, I was hoping
that you would understand.

179
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,297
But I have no other option.

180
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:24,880
I can only let you jump
into ditches I can get you out of.

181
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:27,172
I waited for two years.

182
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:28,422
But not anymore.

183
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,463
I never wanted to do this in life.

184
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:34,297
But I have no other option to save you.

185
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:39,088
Think of it this way,
it's either her, or me.

186
00:10:56,672 --> 00:11:01,130
"Boy, you don't have
to be the last one standing."

187
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:04,797
"Boy show me,
you could be the one, one, one..."

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,172
"Look into my eyes... and come closer."

189
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,797
"You wear high heels...
and I am crazy about you."

190
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:17,922
"You make tall claims...
prove it to me."

191
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:22,838
"Come closer, handsome."

192
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:25,255
"I wanna see you whine like Rihanna..."

193
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:28,213
"Get all the pounder,
Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

194
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,838
"She burnin' up like the summer..."

195
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,630
"She'd tell me, I'm good
at Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom ."

196
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,505
"You've got me like crazy."

197
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:35,463
"That you callin' me..."

198
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,172
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

199
00:11:37,255 --> 00:11:38,921
"You've got me like crazy."

200
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:40,172
"That you callin' me..."

201
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,797
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

202
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:50,797
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

203
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,713
"Girl, I know you want me..."

204
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,297
"It was love at first sight for me."

205
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,255
"You know, believe me..."

206
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,130
"This is me expressing
my feelings to you."

207
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:04,213
"You went behind my
back and ogled others."

208
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:08,880
"You stole my heart and
then stabbed me in the back."

209
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:11,630
"You talk a lot..."

210
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:13,380
"Let me explain."

211
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:18,130
"Come closer, handsome."

212
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:20,588
"I wanna see you whine like Rihanna..."

213
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,505
"Get all the pounder,
Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

214
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:25,255
"She burnin' up like the summer..."

215
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:27,880
"She'd tell me,
I'm good at Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

216
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:29,796
"You've got me like crazy."

217
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:30,672
"That you callin' me..."

218
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,630
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

219
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:34,421
"You've got me like crazy."

220
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,547
"That you callin' me..."

221
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,255
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

222
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:42,963
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

223
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:46,922
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

224
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,255
"Oh baby, give me one more dance..."

225
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:51,547
"One more dance, one more dance."

226
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,880
"Oh baby, we can make it last..."

227
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:56,463
"Make it last, make it last."

228
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,630
"Give me girl,
give me just like that..."

229
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,130
"Cause you're body's like a hourglass."

230
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,463
"To the left, to the right..."

231
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,797
- "Everybody in the club...
- Diggy-Diggy Bom Bom."

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,047
"I wanna see you, I wanna see you..."

233
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,880
"I wanna see you whine like Rihanna..."

234
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,755
"Get all the pounder,
Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

235
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,546
"She burnin' up like the summer..."

236
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:16,505
"She'd tell me,
I'm good at Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom."

237
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,172
"You've got me like crazy."

238
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,380
"That you callin' me..."

239
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:20,963
"Bom Diggy-Diggy, Bom Bom!"

240
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,672
"You've got me like crazy."

241
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:24,130
"That you callin' me..."

242
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,213
"Bom Diggy-Diggy... Bom Bom!"

243
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:31,380
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

244
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:36,005
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

245
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:40,505
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

246
00:13:40,547 --> 00:13:44,838
"Totally crazy...
Totally crazy, this heart..."

247
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:56,148
Just yesterday, I told uncle
that we wouldn't be able to make it...

248
00:13:56,172 --> 00:13:57,005
We have a lot of work in Delhi.

249
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:58,607
We will come to Meerut after four days.

250
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,172
Now he'll censure me.

251
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,398
"You say you have work
when I ask you to come down."

252
00:14:01,422 --> 00:14:03,422
"And you come immediately
when mother asks you to."

253
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:06,755
Don't drink at least on Tuesdays.

254
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:07,630
I didn't.

255
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:08,752
Did you get the lotus stem?

256
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:09,588
He informed me at night.

257
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:10,713
What nonsense is this?

258
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:13,517
Will it be right for Ghasitarams
to take Haldiram's sweets with them?

259
00:14:13,797 --> 00:14:14,463
Where are you going?

260
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,380
What do you mean?

261
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,172
No matter where he is going...

262
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:19,023
It'd never be right for Haldiram
to take Ghasitaram's sweets with him.

263
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,148
You are getting the names wrong.

264
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:21,047
I am wrong?

265
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:21,963
You are wrong.

266
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:22,630
Tell papa.

267
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,422
He is talking about Ghasitaram
taking Haldiram's sweets..

268
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:28,213
And not the other way around.

269
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,297
Obviously.

270
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,630
Why would they take ours?

271
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:31,838
Theirs is better.

272
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:33,130
On whose side are you?

273
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,130
I am on your side.

274
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:35,648
- We won't take someone else's sweet.
- Right.

275
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,297
But papa is also right.

276
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,273
The quality of our sweets
has gone down, hasn't it?

277
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,497
That's what brother is saying.

278
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,023
When did our quality deteriorate?

279
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,630
Your sweets were never of good quality.

280
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:44,547
It's the same.

281
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:45,755
Just as yours.

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,320
There was either no quality even then,
or it's there even now.

283
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,297
Take that back!

284
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:52,922
Take it back!

285
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:55,630
Rukmani, I will shoot him.

286
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:59,255
You'd compare your shit with my sweets?

287
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:02,005
I used to make them with my own hands.

288
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:06,130
Confectioners of Mathura used to send spies
to find out how our Pedas were made.

289
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:07,005
And those Alwar's...?

290
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:11,630
Alwar's shopkeepers used to send
men with money to get our recipes.

291
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:12,922
Take that back!

292
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:14,671
Rukmani, tell him to take it back.

293
00:15:14,672 --> 00:15:16,380
Otherwise, I will shoot him for real.

294
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,505
Okay, I take it back.

295
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,255
Yours was better but...

296
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:27,130
Better? The question of better
arises when there's competition.

297
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,297
- Yours is...
- Lalu...

298
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
Yes.

299
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,797
Put Haldiram's sweets
in our box and take them.

300
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,421
End this topic now.
Dinner is being served.

301
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:35,005
This is a limit.

302
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,773
Why don't we take
chocolate pastry instead?

303
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:38,297
This is what was left to be said.

304
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,148
I will take chocolate with me to go
meet my grandson's prospective wife?

305
00:15:41,172 --> 00:15:41,922
Prospective wife?

306
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:43,005
Which grandson?

307
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,297
Titu, you didn't tell him?

308
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,047
Surprise.

309
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,231
See, I am doing as you said.

310
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:47,898
You asked me to get married,
so I am getting married.

311
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:48,505
Are you nuts...

312
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,297
He isn't getting married.

313
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:49,755
He's just going to meet a girl.

314
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,755
There is a prospective match for him.

315
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I met 19 girls before
I met your mother.

316
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:54,338
But all of a sudden...?

317
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,380
You made only rice?

318
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,130
Where's chicken?

319
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,047
It's Tuesday.

320
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,047
How about cottage
cheese with peas then?

321
00:15:58,172 --> 00:15:59,273
You could have made
something more appetizing.

322
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:00,937
Mr. Malhotra got a
heart attack last week.

323
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,213
He was just 48 years old.

324
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:03,630
No oily food from today.

325
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,297
My stomach is acting weird.

326
00:16:06,422 --> 00:16:07,255
Go for a walk?

327
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:08,547
Yes, let's go for a walk.

328
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:12,755
I too will join you.

329
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,505
He fed me chickpeas in the evening.

330
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:15,755
I am feeling heavy.

331
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:17,082
I will eat after I come back.

332
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:18,630
My stomach is upset as well.

333
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,672
Yes, of course, it is upset.

334
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,677
I know how you'd react
if I had made mince meat.

335
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,355
Let me see how often your stomach
get upset after you get married.

336
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:27,672
Stay.

337
00:16:33,047 --> 00:16:34,338
Bro, I know you have needs.

338
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:36,225
But you don't need
marriage to fulfill them.

339
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:37,422
Needs?

340
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:38,797
Have you lost it?

341
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
No, seriously.

342
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:42,981
There are hundreds of girls out there who
don't want to be in a serious relationship...

343
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,797
And... just, you know, have fun?

344
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,005
How do you think I am surviving?

345
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,422
Everyone has needs.

346
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,630
Sonu, my darling, I know.

347
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,505
I am not getting married for sex.

348
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,297
Shall we change the cook?

349
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,505
We've already purchased
a new washing machine and dryer.

350
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,648
I want to get married,
not open a laundry service.

351
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:03,898
But why do you want get married?

352
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,231
I am of the right age to get married.

353
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,671
I feel I should have
someone in my life..

354
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:09,130
Who would stay with me,
love me, take care of me.

355
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:10,380
Someone?

356
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:11,380
What about me?

357
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:12,922
Am I not enough?

358
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,380
Don't I give you enough love?

359
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:15,172
My love isn't enough?

360
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:16,172
Don't I take care of you?

361
00:17:16,255 --> 00:17:18,398
Will your wife clean your
vomit every Friday and Saturday?

362
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,422
As if you do.

363
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,547
At least I encourage you.

364
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,880
Who holds your forehead?

365
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:24,297
Didn't I take care of
you when you had fever in May?

366
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,588
I was to go on my third date.

367
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,230
I was sure to get lucky, but
I cancelled and stayed back with you.

368
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,005
"I don't take care of you!"

369
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,023
What is it that your wife
will give you that I cannot?

370
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,130
Except for one thing.

371
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,755
And I can arrange for that as well.

372
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:35,547
Just tell me.

373
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,630
But I am not getting married for sex.

374
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,005
Ghasite, talk to him. He has lost it.

375
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:41,380
We are still so young.

376
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:43,255
Who gets married at a tender age of 27?

377
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,130
Ghasite, support?

378
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,657
Forget it. How does it concern us?

379
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,130
He will be the one getting laid.

380
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:50,672
He will be the one buying a condom.

381
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,171
We just have to go there to get drunk.

382
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,255
I am not getting married for sex.

383
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:55,879
Then why are you getting married?

384
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,963
Because he is nuts.

385
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,380
Who's behind this shit?

386
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:08,672
Who found the girl?

387
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,922
They approached us.

388
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,422
How is that possible?

389
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:13,838
What do you mean?

390
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,338
No one approached for me.

391
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:17,671
As you are not my heir.

392
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:19,130
For someone to approach...

393
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,588
That hurt, Ghasite!

394
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:24,172
I'll leave something
for you too in my will.

395
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:25,523
You still haven't made your will?

396
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:26,547
Listen...

397
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,755
No nonsense, no arguments, no fights.

398
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:31,255
I swear I'll use my sandals
if anyone behaves badly.

399
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:33,828
Except for you two,
mother will use her sandals for y'all.

400
00:18:34,922 --> 00:18:35,755
<i>Thu...</i>

401
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,547
Ready?

402
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:37,997
- Let's go already.
- Let's go.

403
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:41,380
Hello.

404
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:42,422
Hi.

405
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:43,672
Hello.

406
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:45,255
Hi.

407
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,797
Have you tried our milk cake?

408
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,547
Only from your Delhi Branch.

409
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:38,713
I swear, I haven't tried
such milk cake anywhere in Alwar.

410
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:41,838
Come to Meerut and try our Pedas.

411
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:46,130
Confectioners of Mathura
send spies to find out the recipe.

412
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,630
- Really?
- Yes.

413
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,755
Sonu, are you a business partner?

414
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:53,213
Forget the business,
these two are partners in everything.

415
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,047
He owns an event company.

416
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,172
Okay.

417
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,630
We will handle the formalities.

418
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:00,630
You go and talk to each other.

419
00:20:00,922 --> 00:20:02,422
I was just going to say that.

420
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:05,422
Where are you going?

421
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:09,047
If he could have his way, he'll
also accompany him on his honeymoon.

422
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,838
Mummy, they aren't going to
get romantic on their first meeting.

423
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,380
And what will I do over here?

424
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:14,773
Let them spend some time alone.

425
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:15,797
You can join them later.

426
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,356
I hope your family is not
pressurizing you to get married.

427
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,380
Why?

428
00:20:33,422 --> 00:20:34,942
Then I'd say that I am not interested.

429
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,255
No, I asked them myself to arrange it.

430
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:38,797
Why?

431
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:40,439
You couldn't find someone on your own?

432
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:41,963
I had a breakup six months ago.

433
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:44,037
We were together for two years.

434
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,255
Then?

435
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,225
Sonu was convinced
that she is wrong for me.

436
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,380
So he broke us off.

437
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,297
Sonu must be dying to
know what we are talking about.

438
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,880
Who is elder, Sonu or you?

439
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,422
I am, around three months?

440
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,010
He was born in September
and I was born in June.

441
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:02,505
I thought you were real brothers.

442
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:03,672
Best friends.

443
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:04,755
Since kindergarten.

444
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:08,172
Oh, he addressed aunty as mummy,
so I thought...

445
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,472
We were in school when
his mother passed away.

446
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:12,755
Our mothers were close friends.

447
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
Ever since then...

448
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:17,167
Uncle is alive hence,
he doesn't address papa as papa.

449
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,255
I mean my Papa-

450
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:20,748
We grew up in the same house.

451
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,463
He used to visit
uncle once a week or so.

452
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:26,255
Then uncle shifted to Canada
so the visits ended as well.

453
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:28,615
We stay together in Delhi as well.

454
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,130
Sonu didn't shift to Canada?

455
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,297
Leaving me alone?

456
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,750
Forget thinking,
no one even bothered asking about it.

457
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:37,088
I'll go see where they are.

458
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,422
Relax, she won't kidnap your Titu.

459
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:40,547
Stay here.

460
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:50,137
When grandpa opened the shop uncle
Lalu used to work there as a cleaner.

461
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:52,148
Then grandma started
treating him as her brother.

462
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:54,755
Ghasita and Lalu uncle
are like Batman and Robbin.

463
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:56,838
He stays with you?

464
00:21:56,922 --> 00:21:57,922
Yes.

465
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,547
Grandpa and him drink every
night at his bedroom's balcony.

466
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,130
He owns 7% of the company.

467
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
Technically company belongs
to grandpa and uncle Lalu.

468
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,648
But it's grandma who rules the house.

469
00:22:07,672 --> 00:22:09,255
Because grandma controls the cash.

470
00:22:09,672 --> 00:22:11,231
All the cash is stored in her cupboard.

471
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:13,797
And she gives the
keys only to uncle Lalu.

472
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:17,130
You can say that even my
mother has never touched those keys.

473
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:21,255
Do you tell all girls where you keep
the cash in the first meeting itself?

474
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,213
You like kids a lot?

475
00:22:33,672 --> 00:22:34,672
Hmm.

476
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,922
I never had the motivation
to make a lot of money.

477
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:40,338
I just intended on
being happy in what I do.

478
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:43,922
You can open your NGO after marriage.

479
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:44,880
Why?

480
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,602
Do you mind if I have
a job after marriage?

481
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,232
And what do you mean by after marriage?

482
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:51,047
Aren't you going too fast?

483
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:53,047
That's why Sonu is always so worried.

484
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:58,172
Are you going to say no?

485
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:23,172
Go with them.

486
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,005
- Lalu?
- Yes, sister?

487
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:46,255
Send someone to Delhi.

488
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:49,797
Start getting information
from all the shops near their house.

489
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,130
I have already found out.

490
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,088
No one smokes,
neither openly nor stealthily...

491
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,255
Hiding from the wife.

492
00:23:55,297 --> 00:23:59,255
Isn't NGO a place where they
first rescue dogs and then sell them?

493
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:00,713
Not all NGOs deal with dogs.

494
00:24:00,797 --> 00:24:02,172
She works for a children's NGO.

495
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:03,422
Mrs. Renu had told us.

496
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:05,047
We only heard NGO.

497
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:07,880
Did you have a private
word with Mrs. Renu?

498
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:09,297
Isn't she too slim?

499
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:11,898
It gets problematic
while delivering a child.

500
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:12,963
We are confectioners.

501
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:16,005
We will make her fat
before we make her pregnant.

502
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,547
We will make her means?

503
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,255
Do you think before you speak?

504
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:20,713
We are confectioners means?

505
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,580
Do you think before you speak?

506
00:24:22,672 --> 00:24:23,297
Mummy?

507
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,742
Don't you think she is too short?

508
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,672
Do you want to play
basketball with her?

509
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,606
Did anyone see what car they drive?

510
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,630
I think Volkswagen.

511
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:30,505
What kind of guesswork is that?

512
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,630
It's not guesswork.

513
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:32,755
I am from a jeweler family.

514
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,731
We can remove bio-data about a family
just by looking at the necklace.

515
00:24:34,755 --> 00:24:35,630
Car is such a small thing.

516
00:24:35,672 --> 00:24:36,505
They own a Skoda.

517
00:24:36,672 --> 00:24:37,713
I asked the valet.

518
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:38,297
When?

519
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,880
When you were busy greeting them.

520
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:40,630
Do you have anything to say now?

521
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:42,546
Skoda and Volkswagen
are one and the same company.

522
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,630
They also own a Volkswagen.

523
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,005
That's Polo.

524
00:24:45,172 --> 00:24:46,297
Volkswagen nevertheless.

525
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,398
How many friends does she have?

526
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:48,505
How would he know?

527
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:49,630
I mean Facebook friends.

528
00:24:49,672 --> 00:24:50,672
It's on the internet.

529
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,547
How do you know?

530
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:52,880
He has a Facebook account.

531
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,005
900 friends?

532
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:56,106
Don't you think that's a lot?

533
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:56,547
Why?

534
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,755
I have 540 friends.

535
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,130
How many of them are boys?

536
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,630
Come on, mummy.

537
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,130
I am asking about Sweety's friends.

538
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,422
Come on, grandma.

539
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:04,505
She votes.

540
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,630
But how will we find out who for?

541
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,130
- Yes.
- That's confidential.

542
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:11,380
Oh my, it's confidential
when it comes to her?

543
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,255
We always discuss before we vote.

544
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,171
Titu will feel bad but she
doesn't have any style sense..

545
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:16,273
In spite of staying in Delhi.

546
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,338
She is looking good.

547
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:20,130
I am talking about the
mother and not the daughter, son.

548
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:23,380
Not even engaged yet and
he's already fighting with his mother.

549
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:25,588
Who is fighting? I am just saying..

550
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:27,755
First, say the thing
which is of utmost importance.

551
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:29,005
We have already said it.

552
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:30,172
What do I say?

553
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,297
What's there to say?

554
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,088
If nothing is wrong then it is right.

555
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:34,672
Yes, we didn't find anything wrong.

556
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:36,047
You say.

557
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:36,880
What do you think?

558
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,547
She's the first girl he has met.

559
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:39,255
So?

560
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,797
Where does it say that
the first girl can't be good?

561
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:42,880
Are we shopping for clothes here..

562
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:45,042
That we should go to
a few shops before buying one?

563
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:47,297
Mummy, I mean,
what should I compare it with?

564
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:48,648
Whom do you want to compare her with?

565
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,505
We aren't buying a car.

566
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,921
Tell us whether you
like the girl or not.

567
00:25:50,922 --> 00:25:51,922
What's there to compare?

568
00:25:54,338 --> 00:25:55,213
I'll think over it and let you know.

569
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:58,671
Yes, think over it,
discuss it and let <i>us</i> know.

570
00:25:58,672 --> 00:25:59,172
We like her.

571
00:25:59,255 --> 00:26:00,255
Let's go.

572
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,380
Rebound is having sex
after a week in anger,

573
00:26:21,422 --> 00:26:23,088
Not marrying after 6 months in sorrow

574
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:24,338
I am not sad, bro.

575
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,620
Then how did you get this idea?

576
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,398
You are the one who
always talks about settling.

577
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:30,088
By settling, I mean, expanding
the business, making more money.

578
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,050
So, this will take care
of one department, right?

579
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,023
Marriage will cover 20
percent of the "settling" part.

580
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,207
Then we will make more money.

581
00:26:36,547 --> 00:26:38,130
First, you stop smiling.

582
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,880
I swear, I will break your teeth.

583
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,380
Why aren't you giving
an answer to mummy?

584
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,255
Are you?

585
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,898
When I seriously do not understand
why you are getting married..

586
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:02,148
Then how do I decide about the girl?

587
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:03,372
Look, I know you are doubtful.

588
00:27:03,547 --> 00:27:05,547
But I seriously think
that I should get married.

589
00:27:05,838 --> 00:27:07,630
Otherwise,
I'll again fall for some girl.

590
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,231
She will make me cry
and you will make me stop.

591
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,481
She will make me cry
and you will make me stop.

592
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,106
She will make me cry
and you will make me stop.

593
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,338
That irritates you as well.

594
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:14,523
I don't have any problem with that.

595
00:27:14,547 --> 00:27:15,380
I will handle it.

596
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:16,255
I promise.

597
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,660
You can cry as much as you want.

598
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:21,787
What do you think about Sweety?

599
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,672
Who can tell whether a girl is the right
girl to marry only in one meeting?

600
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,523
I mean there should
be some compatibility..

601
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:30,231
A chance to know each other better,
matching wavelengths...

602
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:31,130
I hope you are getting me.

603
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:32,255
Of course.

604
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:33,648
How can you get married
after just one meeting..

605
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:34,898
Because you didn't find anything wrong?

606
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:36,130
Correct, you cannot.

607
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,880
And you are all smiles these days.

608
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:42,630
You were better off crying.

609
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:44,562
But one can at least
get betrothed, right?

610
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,231
People get betrothed so that
they can know each other better..

611
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,855
Understand their compatibility,
wavelength and everything else.

612
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,315
Is she good enough to get betrothed to?

613
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:56,672
She is okay.

614
00:27:57,172 --> 00:27:58,172
Yes, mom?

615
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:00,047
She is good.

616
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,130
Say yes.

617
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:03,172
Yes.

618
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,422
Yes, okay.

619
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:07,422
Okay, bye.

620
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:27,755
"Restlessness I feel from
the first moment itself..."

621
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:31,213
"What the future beholds
I can't foretell."

622
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:38,380
"Why my heart is inclining
towards you, I can't tell."

623
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:41,755
"New beginnings..."

624
00:28:42,297 --> 00:28:45,797
"These are new things..."

625
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:48,630
"The darkness has faded away..."

626
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:52,255
"It seems."

627
00:28:52,922 --> 00:28:59,755
"A new dawn, when I met you..."

628
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,047
"When I met you..."

629
00:29:03,172 --> 00:29:07,880
"I found new air to breathe."

630
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:14,922
"A new dawn, when I met you..."

631
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,047
"When I met you..."

632
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:22,838
"I found new air to breathe."

633
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,672
"When I met you..."

634
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,797
"A new dawn..."

635
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:53,255
"Now my heartbeats
travel as per your wish."

636
00:29:53,547 --> 00:29:57,172
"When you looked at me,
I felt alive..."

637
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,713
"Magical are your eyes."

638
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,047
"You are..."

639
00:30:03,547 --> 00:30:05,172
"My world..."

640
00:30:05,255 --> 00:30:09,047
"You are...
the one my heart belongs to..."

641
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:12,630
"You are...
the one my world revolves around..."

642
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:16,463
"You are...
the one my heart belongs to..."

643
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:20,922
"You are the one who
makes me aware of myself."

644
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:28,130
"A new dawn, when I met you..."

645
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:30,172
"When I met you..."

646
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:35,963
"I found new air to breathe."

647
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:39,380
"When I met you..."

648
00:30:43,422 --> 00:30:46,130
"A new dawn..."

649
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,463
"When I met you..."

650
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:20,047
Can't you hear the violins?

651
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,255
Why would I hear violins?

652
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:25,005
They are playing so loud for me.

653
00:31:25,047 --> 00:31:26,687
Listen carefully and
you too will hear it.

654
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:40,630
You have confused me.

655
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:41,630
Why?

656
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:44,757
I don't understand whether ours is an
arranged marriage or a love marriage.

657
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:50,338
Let's go, sister.

658
00:32:10,255 --> 00:32:13,380
Rebound is having sex after
a week in anger, you idiot

659
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:15,797
not marrying after
six months if you are sad.

660
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:18,172
What's this?

661
00:32:18,422 --> 00:32:19,422
It's from home.

662
00:32:19,463 --> 00:32:20,672
From Meerut?

663
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,380
Shall I send it back?

664
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:30,588
Set the table.

665
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:32,880
She is so cute.

666
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,755
Too cute to be true.

667
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:40,422
What happened?

668
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:41,797
Spill it out.

669
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,672
You are so happy these days,
Titu that its...

670
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,422
I don't know how to say it.

671
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:52,130
You don't like Sweety?

672
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,047
She is a case of too good to be true.

673
00:32:55,297 --> 00:32:57,398
When you see a very good deal
you get this thought in your mind..

674
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,297
That something is
surely wrong about it.

675
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:02,421
I mean the last time I
saw such a family was in '96...

676
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:03,648
In the movie Hum Apke Hain Kaun.

677
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:04,672
That's '94.

678
00:33:05,297 --> 00:33:06,130
It was in the theatres for two years.

679
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:07,755
I saw it again in '96.

680
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:09,755
Stick to the point.

681
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,012
Look, I am still not
getting the right feeling.

682
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,505
A feeling is a feeling...

683
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:16,982
There is no reason or proof to back it.

684
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,650
Instead, I have only proof against it.

685
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,330
She works at a children's NGO.

686
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,880
She is polite to everyone.

687
00:33:22,172 --> 00:33:23,255
She sends tiffins.

688
00:33:23,297 --> 00:33:24,523
She does all the correct things.

689
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:25,297
But that's the issue.

690
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:26,880
She does all the correct things.

691
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,422
No one can be so perfect.

692
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:29,505
Something has to be fishy.

693
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:32,172
This is your motherly instinct for me.

694
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:35,130
Look, you have always got
me out of shit girls have put me in.

695
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:37,547
You are being protective of me.

696
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:40,453
I am not saying it is wrong
for you to get these feelings.

697
00:33:40,672 --> 00:33:42,856
But this time the feeling
that you are getting is wrong.

698
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,297
I think you should spend
more time with Sweety.

699
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
I am telling you...

700
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:49,255
Once you get to know her,
you'll feel differently.

701
00:33:49,422 --> 00:33:50,422
I guarantee that.

702
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:52,255
It's just a bad feeling.

703
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:54,297
Are you seriously sure about this?

704
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:56,297
Because I am not at all convinced.

705
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:57,713
I am sure.

706
00:33:57,797 --> 00:33:58,797
100 percent.

707
00:33:59,297 --> 00:34:00,297
She is different.

708
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:05,588
You know every idiot in this
world thinks his girl is different.

709
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:09,922
And after hearing you say
that I am sure that you are so F.

710
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,672
Titu told me that you couldn't believe
that he found such a nice girl.

711
00:34:33,213 --> 00:34:37,088
Yes, I told her that you couldn't
believe that she's actually so nice.

712
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:40,255
Just consider him lucky.

713
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,672
Like he had found such
a good friend like you..

714
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:45,638
He also found such
a good girl for himself.

715
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,755
Do I look like a liar?

716
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:08,755
Whom will the husband
tell if not his wife?

717
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:10,380
Is this something you share?

718
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,755
It's not the conversation
but the people who matter.

719
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:15,880
Like I tell everything to Lalu.

720
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:17,148
Like you tell everything to Titu.

721
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:18,338
And Titu tells Sweety.

722
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:19,856
Everything is going wrong, Ghasita.

723
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,380
My feelings are getting stronger.

724
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:22,672
I don't know what to do now.

725
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:24,035
He is getting out of my control.

726
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,047
What you thought was a strong
thread was just a weak string.

727
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,130
It broke.

728
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:30,921
And the kite is floating
in the sky, Sonu.

729
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:31,797
Don't feel disheartened.

730
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,630
It will fall on Sweety's roof.

731
00:35:34,047 --> 00:35:35,172
He will run and grab it.

732
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,213
Sonu is no less.

733
00:35:36,255 --> 00:35:37,297
Wanna bet?

734
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:38,755
Sonu...

735
00:35:39,047 --> 00:35:40,047
Should I bet on you?

736
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:42,797
Go ahead... pull my leg.

737
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,171
I am warning you,
if they get married...

738
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:49,255
"I think you should spend
more time with Sweety."

739
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,380
"I am telling you..."

740
00:35:50,505 --> 00:35:53,172
"Once you get to know her,
you'll feel differently."

741
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:54,255
"I guarantee it."

742
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:56,380
"It's just a bad feeling."

743
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:34,047
Who are you?

744
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,630
- Babu?
- Sister?

745
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,130
Sonu...

746
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:39,672
Okay, sister.

747
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,255
Make some lemonade for him.

748
00:36:41,755 --> 00:36:42,755
Okay.

749
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:47,297
You met Babu?

750
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:48,130
Why is he here?

751
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:49,088
He's here for us.

752
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:50,047
I don't need him.

753
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,130
Even public toilets
are cleaner than these.

754
00:36:52,255 --> 00:36:53,921
We have a maid who cleans them..

755
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:55,255
Why did you call Babu for it?

756
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,523
What will he do the rest of the time?

757
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,981
What do you mean by what will he do?

758
00:36:58,005 --> 00:36:58,672
Babu...

759
00:36:58,797 --> 00:37:01,505
Call the plumber in the afternoon
and get the flush repaired.

760
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,547
Send the bedsheets to the laundry.

761
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,380
And make watermelon juice for Titu.

762
00:37:06,047 --> 00:37:07,398
What's the use of
making so much money..

763
00:37:07,422 --> 00:37:09,222
When you are still
living like in a hostel?

764
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:11,425
There has to be a quality
of life as well, right?

765
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:22,005
What's your full name?

766
00:37:22,255 --> 00:37:24,255
Babu... Jaidev Babu.

767
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,255
Your egg white omelette.

768
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:29,356
Who asked you to make you the omelette?

769
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,380
Sister.

770
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:31,856
Who asked you to make
using only egg whites?

771
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,005
Sister.

772
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:40,255
He is her squealer.

773
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,130
Squealer?

774
00:37:41,255 --> 00:37:42,047
A SPY. You dunce!

775
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:42,755
James Bond.

776
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,421
She is M and he is her 007.

777
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:45,422
I am telling you.

778
00:37:49,922 --> 00:37:51,172
Whom am I even telling!

779
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,755
Babu, where are my jeans?

780
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,630
They're still wet.

781
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,047
Why?

782
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:03,005
I washed it.

783
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:04,505
Who asked you to wash it?

784
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,672
Sister.

785
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:21,630
What is this?

786
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,280
Bread made from pearl millet flour.

787
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:25,880
Sister asked me to make it.

788
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,547
Sister asked me to do it.

789
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,130
Babu, where are my shoes.

790
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,172
Sister asked me to do it.

791
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:50,880
But idiot, where are they?

792
00:38:50,922 --> 00:38:51,922
Outside, on the rack.

793
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Yes.

794
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:09,838
Babu... what are you doing, Babu?

795
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:13,005
Forgive me, please?

796
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:13,880
Babu... what are you doing, Babu?

797
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:15,047
Babu... no!

798
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:17,172
Sister asked me to do it!

799
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:32,797
Hey you...

800
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:33,588
Yes?

801
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:34,797
Whose t-shirt is that?

802
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:35,963
Mine.

803
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:36,755
Really?

804
00:39:36,922 --> 00:39:37,962
Where did you buy it from?

805
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:38,505
Sister...

806
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:39,587
You bought it from sister?

807
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:41,088
Sister sells t-shirts?

808
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,005
You liar...

809
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:42,588
Sister!

810
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:43,797
What happened, Babu?

811
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,255
Brother wants my t-shirt.

812
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:48,547
I am so sorry, Sonu.

813
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,005
I found it with Titu's
old clothes so I thought...

814
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:52,672
Return it, Babu.

815
00:39:54,922 --> 00:39:56,129
Have you gone crazy?

816
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,338
You can buy a new one, Sonu.

817
00:39:57,672 --> 00:39:58,505
I wasn't asking for it, I was just...

818
00:39:58,547 --> 00:39:59,672
I am really sorry, Sonu...

819
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:00,797
I didn't think...

820
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:01,922
Babu, give it back.

821
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:04,297
I wasn't asking for it,
Sweety, I was just asking...

822
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,880
Babu, I just asked you, didn't I?

823
00:40:15,172 --> 00:40:16,172
You are just too much.

824
00:40:16,255 --> 00:40:17,505
You made the poor boy cry.

825
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:03,172
Babu...

826
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:08,797
Yes, brother.

827
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:09,922
Can I have the remote?

828
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:18,547
Thank you.

829
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:23,797
Babu...

830
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,075
Can I have the other one as well?

831
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:51,872
Can I have some water, please?

832
00:42:36,797 --> 00:42:37,172
Babu...

833
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:37,672
Hmm?

834
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:38,672
- Babu“.
- Yes?

835
00:42:38,755 --> 00:42:39,297
Babu... wake up!

836
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:40,422
Yes?

837
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:41,955
Can I have some salad, please?

838
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:03,922
Babu!

839
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:04,838
Yes, brother!

840
00:43:04,922 --> 00:43:06,255
Can you help me wash it, please?

841
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:16,922
Babu!

842
00:43:32,797 --> 00:43:34,338
You work so hard, Babu.

843
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,480
You'll die if you
keep working like this.

844
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:39,172
You are so young.

845
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,422
There is something called
quality of life as well, right?

846
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:45,130
Leave that and come with me.

847
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,047
Learn to relax a little.

848
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,255
Look what I brought for you.

849
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:57,297
Don't worry.

850
00:43:57,672 --> 00:43:59,047
Sister won't find out.

851
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:05,797
You relax over here.

852
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,297
I'll be back.

853
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,672
Babu, porn? That too Bhojpuri?

854
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,672
Disgusting.

855
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:39,088
Sister, it is not what it looks like.

856
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:47,672
I am being trapped.

857
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:52,922
I am innocent.

858
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:32,422
"Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la,
ooh la la You are my fantasy.."

859
00:45:43,672 --> 00:45:44,672
Hi.

860
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:45,755
Hi.

861
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:56,273
At least tell me that you
have given her the house keys.

862
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:57,297
What if I was naked?

863
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,648
That wouldn't have told
you when she is going to show up.

864
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:01,192
You should be doing it in the bedroom.

865
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:02,672
Is there a sofa here?

866
00:46:02,755 --> 00:46:03,547
You have a bed!

867
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:04,505
I like sofas.

868
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:05,606
I want to do it on the sofa.

869
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,422
It's my wish I'll
do it wherever I want to.

870
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:09,157
Then get the sofa in your bedroom.

871
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:34,630
22nd December, 27th December...

872
00:46:34,797 --> 00:46:36,172
After that there's 24th February.

873
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:38,755
No no, why wait till February?

874
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,421
22nd October is fine.

875
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,380
Not October, he said December.

876
00:46:43,297 --> 00:46:44,297
You said December?

877
00:46:46,797 --> 00:46:47,797
I said October.

878
00:46:47,922 --> 00:46:49,630
- October.
- October.

879
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:53,797
It falls on a Saturday.

880
00:46:53,922 --> 00:46:55,481
It will be easy for
everyone to attend as well.

881
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:56,672
It's perfect.

882
00:46:56,797 --> 00:46:58,088
So 22nd October is fixed.

883
00:46:58,172 --> 00:46:58,713
Good.

884
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,755
Offer sweets to everyone.

885
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:01,481
Whatever date it is,
I just want everything to go smoothly.

886
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:02,921
Here, the date is fixed.

887
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:04,722
Have as much fun as
you want with your friend.

888
00:47:04,797 --> 00:47:07,838
- You don't have much time with him now.
- Congratulations.

889
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:11,297
Then say it.

890
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Why are you feeling shy?

891
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:13,130
What is it?

892
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:14,172
It's nothing, grandma.

893
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:16,588
She had thought of something but now...

894
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:18,005
Just say it Sweety.

895
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:22,088
Grandma, I had said that
I'd hold a prayer function at home..

896
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,047
When my wedding date gets fixed.

897
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:25,380
Then do that, dear.

898
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,790
We will definitely attend it.

899
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,880
Mummy, at 'home'.

900
00:47:32,797 --> 00:47:33,797
Sonu...

901
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:35,047
<i>Thu...</i>

902
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:36,255
Make preparations for it.

903
00:47:51,922 --> 00:47:52,922
What is it?

904
00:47:59,130 --> 00:47:59,880
What's wrong?

905
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,380
Ghasitey,
I am telling you, this girl is wrong.

906
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,797
Have you ever met such a sweet girl,
such a nice family?

907
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:07,880
It's a sham.

908
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:09,505
Well I'm convinced it's a sham.

909
00:48:10,297 --> 00:48:13,213
How can anyone trust anything about
a person who praises our milk cake..

910
00:48:13,297 --> 00:48:18,588
The way he did..that
too of the Delhi Branch.

911
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:19,755
Right, Lalu?

912
00:48:19,922 --> 00:48:21,797
Looked like cheats to me.

913
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:22,838
True.

914
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:25,856
Then why aren't you saying anything?

915
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
Why should I?

916
00:48:27,463 --> 00:48:28,463
Who cares!

917
00:48:28,922 --> 00:48:31,755
Everyone in this house
thinks that they are over-smart.

918
00:48:31,797 --> 00:48:32,797
Good for them.

919
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,372
They will learn a hard lesson.

920
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:35,672
He is your grandson.

921
00:48:35,755 --> 00:48:37,555
That doesn't make me
responsible for his life.

922
00:48:37,797 --> 00:48:38,588
I taught him to earn.

923
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:39,797
Opened a shop for him.

924
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:41,088
I have done my duty.

925
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:43,814
It won't make any difference to you
if a wrong girl comes to your house?

926
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,356
How would it make any difference to me?

927
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,797
It is my house, my money, my company.

928
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:50,422
And I haven't made a will
either that she'd kill me.

929
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:53,356
And I won't let him eat anything she
cooks before tasting it first, so...

930
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,797
What are you saying!

931
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:57,713
Look, we know that she is a wrong girl.

932
00:48:57,797 --> 00:48:58,630
Even if she were right..

933
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:00,231
It wouldn't have
made any difference to us.

934
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:03,422
Now at least there is some scope
of entertainment in the house.

935
00:49:03,547 --> 00:49:05,547
Now the fun will begin
when she has to pick sides.

936
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,172
Titu's grandma vs Titu's mom.

937
00:49:08,255 --> 00:49:09,273
There were just two of them so far..

938
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:10,417
So it was smooth sailing.

939
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:12,880
Now with three, groupism will start.

940
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:14,130
We know everything.

941
00:49:14,422 --> 00:49:15,630
Don't bore us.

942
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:17,213
Don't ruin our night.

943
00:49:17,547 --> 00:49:20,838
Have a drink if you want
to, otherwise go to sleep.

944
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,630
Hey, you...

945
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,130
Close the door.

946
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:38,421
Rukmani, if even after
52 years you don't trust me..

947
00:49:38,422 --> 00:49:40,902
Then I swear, all these
years have just been an utter waste.

948
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,797
I am telling you, I don't have it.

949
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,255
I was just praying-

950
00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:48,047
Untie your pajama.

951
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:49,130
Show me the pockets of your underpants.

952
00:49:49,172 --> 00:49:49,922
I don't have it.

953
00:49:50,047 --> 00:49:51,398
From the time you have
made me take an oath...

954
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,588
I haven't even seen them.

955
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,296
He haven't even touched them for
nine years after he pledged to you.

956
00:49:56,297 --> 00:49:58,255
You consider him to be your brother.

957
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,922
Believe in your brother.

958
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:01,755
Lalu...

959
00:50:01,922 --> 00:50:02,338
Sister?

960
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:05,130
Swear upon our bond,
and say that he doesn't smoke.

961
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:11,380
I swear upon our bond, my sister...

962
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:13,672
He doesn't smoke.

963
00:50:18,672 --> 00:50:20,422
The guest list has exceeded 2000.

964
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:22,172
Have you found a farmhouse?

965
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:23,255
What's the hurry?

966
00:50:23,422 --> 00:50:24,898
It's not like the wedding is tomorrow.

967
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:26,648
Right, so we'll look for a
farmhouse one day before the wedding?

968
00:50:26,672 --> 00:50:28,731
Then you can talk to the decorator
on the day of the wedding itself.

969
00:50:28,755 --> 00:50:30,296
But we have such a
nice farmhouse ourselves.

970
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:31,838
But it cannot accommodate 2000 guests.

971
00:50:33,172 --> 00:50:34,630
Why are we spending so much money?

972
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:37,273
Let's invite only those relatives who will
actually be pleased with our marriage.

973
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:38,398
2000 people will attend the wedding.

974
00:50:38,422 --> 00:50:39,898
Out of them 900 wouldn't even know us,

975
00:50:39,922 --> 00:50:41,255
And we wouldn't know 900,

976
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:42,838
We'll only be wasting money.

977
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:45,322
We will have to invite those
whose weddings we have attended.

978
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:46,671
Otherwise everyone will taunt..

979
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:48,472
That we took the
cheap way out on our turn.

980
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:50,427
And why are you getting
worried about the money?

981
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,898
I had a word with your father
that we'll spilt the expenses.

982
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:54,088
It's not about the expenses.

983
00:50:54,297 --> 00:50:55,796
Who else do they have but me?

984
00:50:55,797 --> 00:50:57,297
And who else do y'all have but Titu?

985
00:50:57,547 --> 00:51:00,005
So whoever spends it,
it's our money that's getting wasted.

986
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:04,046
Sweety and I have
been discussing this..

987
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,523
Why don't we go for a destination
wedding with a few close relatives?

988
00:51:06,547 --> 00:51:08,172
Now that's a money saver!

989
00:51:08,672 --> 00:51:10,880
You want to do a destination
wedding to save money?

990
00:51:11,672 --> 00:51:13,352
You will end up spending
double the amount.

991
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:15,505
I am telling you,
he will make you go bankrupt.

992
00:51:15,755 --> 00:51:17,922
Destination weddings
cost half as much in reality.

993
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:19,838
Shall I recommend a good event manager?

994
00:51:19,922 --> 00:51:20,922
You can get it checked.

995
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,796
Your grandpa has made a lot of
money and worked very hard to make it.

996
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,172
Titu's my only grandson.

997
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,005
This isn't going
to be any small wedding.

998
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:37,213
You just think about
what more we can do!

999
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:39,375
Do you want to drive off
from the wedding in a Jaguar?

1000
00:51:39,922 --> 00:51:41,672
Sonu, check the delivery period.

1001
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:43,987
Better idea, just give me the money.

1002
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:45,167
I will make a fixed deposit.

1003
00:51:45,505 --> 00:51:46,505
Hahaha...

1004
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:49,880
Such girls bring prosperity home.

1005
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,422
Lalu...

1006
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:08,297
Take another one percent.

1007
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:12,255
It would be better if you take the other
7 percent back as well, Ghasitey.

1008
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:14,630
I am going to tell
the truth to sister today.

1009
00:52:14,672 --> 00:52:16,422
What's the big deal today?

1010
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:21,130
We have been settling every lie with
one percent since the last 52 years.

1011
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,297
Take two this time.

1012
00:52:23,505 --> 00:52:26,297
You'll become a 9 percent
owner of my wealth.

1013
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,922
Two percent?

1014
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:30,547
Mr. Ghasitaram...

1015
00:52:31,297 --> 00:52:33,672
This wasn't a small lie.

1016
00:52:35,172 --> 00:52:36,630
You don't have a sister!

1017
00:52:37,297 --> 00:52:40,171
You don't know the
difference between lying..

1018
00:52:40,172 --> 00:52:43,880
And lying by swearing upon the bond,
Mr. Ghasita.

1019
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:52,275
Does that chair belong to your father?

1020
00:52:52,547 --> 00:52:53,838
Is it your father's?

1021
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,172
That chair belongs to Lalu!

1022
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:03,172
Can you help explain
to me the difference?

1023
00:53:03,797 --> 00:53:05,505
There is a difference of six percent!

1024
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,547
Four... four percent.

1025
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:12,797
Seven and four,
settle on eleven percent.

1026
00:53:14,422 --> 00:53:15,797
It's an auspicious number too.

1027
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,422
That's better.

1028
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:23,672
Hey you...

1029
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:25,297
Move!

1030
00:53:30,672 --> 00:53:31,672
Come, sit.

1031
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:32,922
Here.

1032
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,255
It's all going wrong.

1033
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:45,797
Here...

1034
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:47,463
Go give it to Titu's father.

1035
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:49,505
- Reena...
- Yes?

1036
00:53:49,547 --> 00:53:50,547
That's not how it's done.

1037
00:54:10,297 --> 00:54:11,297
What is this?

1038
00:54:12,297 --> 00:54:13,880
Bill... of the wedding agency.

1039
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:15,380
150,000?

1040
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:17,547
Yes, we took the platinum package.

1041
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,672
They are good.

1042
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,755
They match everything.

1043
00:54:19,797 --> 00:54:22,517
They find out about all expectations,
budgets and then fix a meeting.

1044
00:54:23,172 --> 00:54:24,532
So Titu's wedding is through them?

1045
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:26,297
Through them? Yes.

1046
00:54:26,922 --> 00:54:28,630
We took their package for Titu...

1047
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:30,106
And Sweety's family too
must have taken a package.

1048
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,297
They must have seen
the bio-data hence called.

1049
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:34,172
What are you doing?

1050
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:35,422
A joke.

1051
00:54:35,547 --> 00:54:37,387
I will frame it and
gift it to Titu and Sweety.

1052
00:54:40,547 --> 00:54:41,297
Strange.

1053
00:54:41,547 --> 00:54:42,547
A joke?

1054
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:44,255
Hello?

1055
00:54:44,297 --> 00:54:45,422
Is that Vivah's office?

1056
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:48,005
I am calling from Ghasitaram's place.

1057
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:50,172
Can we meet today?

1058
00:54:51,463 --> 00:54:52,463
Yes, sure.

1059
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:40,398
Take this, we are getting late.

1060
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:41,047
Take this as well.

1061
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:43,380
Grandma, Titu is asking for fifty.

1062
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:44,755
Lalu...

1063
00:55:46,797 --> 00:55:47,838
Get fifty.

1064
00:55:47,922 --> 00:55:51,130
"What are you doing?"

1065
00:55:51,755 --> 00:55:54,088
"Why have you forgotten Goddess?"

1066
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:55,588
Grandma wants to talk to you.

1067
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:03,297
"Why have you forgotten Goddess?"

1068
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,880
Yes, grandma?

1069
00:56:12,922 --> 00:56:16,297
Sweety, Sonu is saying that
there is a boy called Rahul who..

1070
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,297
You were earlier betrothed to?

1071
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:19,630
- Grandma...
- Yes, grandma.

1072
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:21,672
We were almost engaged.

1073
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:22,880
You never informed us?

1074
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,255
I thought the agency
must have informed.

1075
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:29,505
Rahul told Sonu some things
about why it was called off.

1076
00:56:30,297 --> 00:56:31,380
What did he say, mummy?

1077
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:33,922
He must've said I was too controlling?

1078
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:35,755
That I didn't trust him?

1079
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:37,282
That I used to check his messages?

1080
00:56:38,547 --> 00:56:41,172
After we got betrothed I
learnt that he has a girlfriend.

1081
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:44,005
Who he never officially broke up with.

1082
00:56:45,172 --> 00:56:47,338
For two months he kept asking
me for time..

1083
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,810
And kept talking to her under
the pretext of trying to break off.

1084
00:56:53,422 --> 00:56:54,505
He never asked for dowry.

1085
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,231
Of course,
because all of us are quite modern.

1086
00:56:57,255 --> 00:56:58,547
Who asks for dowry nowadays?

1087
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,050
He just got it conveyed
through the agency that..

1088
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:03,481
My parents would gift me a
'C Class' at least, as a wedding gift?

1089
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:04,505
By their own wish.

1090
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:09,152
Did he tell you what happened in Goa?

1091
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:12,797
I got drunk, created a scene,

1092
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,547
Embarrassed him,

1093
00:57:15,297 --> 00:57:16,297
pushed him so hard...

1094
00:57:17,172 --> 00:57:18,547
That it broke his arm.

1095
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:23,005
He had taken me to Goa.

1096
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:26,630
Saying that even though
it is an arranged marriage,

1097
00:57:26,672 --> 00:57:28,912
he wants to propose to
me in a proper romantic manner.

1098
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:32,755
After two drinks, he thought he
obtained permission to have sex with me.

1099
00:57:38,297 --> 00:57:40,172
He wanted to check
our sexual compatibility.

1100
00:57:42,422 --> 00:57:44,222
Very important for a married life,
apparently.

1101
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,520
When I refused,
he forced himself upon me.

1102
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:54,255
Hence I pushed him.

1103
00:57:55,422 --> 00:57:56,505
Did he mention that?

1104
00:58:00,797 --> 00:58:02,880
This topic shall never
be discussed again.

1105
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:06,755
What happened?

1106
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,130
Nothing, mummy.

1107
00:58:09,172 --> 00:58:12,255
- Welcome.
- Come, dear.

1108
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:13,797
Hello.

1109
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,755
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1110
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Yes, sure.

1111
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:19,005
Hello.

1112
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,005
All the devotees are welcomed here.

1113
00:58:34,047 --> 00:58:35,047
Come on.

1114
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:38,255
"It is a very auspicious occasion."

1115
00:58:39,505 --> 00:58:40,797
"It is a very auspicious night."

1116
00:58:42,922 --> 00:58:45,380
"Today we offer our prayers..."

1117
00:58:48,255 --> 00:58:48,672
<i>Thu...</i>

1118
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:50,393
She had told me in
the first meeting itself.

1119
00:58:52,297 --> 00:58:53,922
She said it was important that I know.

1120
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:56,755
I didn't inform everyone because.

1121
00:58:57,297 --> 00:58:59,005
Because it's our personal matter.

1122
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,047
You could have just asked me.

1123
00:59:13,922 --> 00:59:15,838
I thought we have that relation.

1124
00:59:18,547 --> 00:59:19,797
You doubt me?

1125
00:59:21,172 --> 00:59:22,297
Am I so bad?

1126
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:32,130
You know, when we got betrothed,
I told my mother that I found both...

1127
00:59:33,422 --> 00:59:37,088
A husband, as well as a brother.

1128
01:00:40,755 --> 01:00:41,922
Go get ready.

1129
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:16,422
I must be the first bride ever to
be waiting for the groom on the stage.

1130
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:17,922
Sonu wasn't ready.

1131
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:20,630
Is he ready now?

1132
01:01:21,422 --> 01:01:22,422
I am.

1133
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,130
"Yo yo Honey Singh!"

1134
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:56,297
"Hey"

1135
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:01,172
"Hey"

1136
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,005
"Listen to my last night's tale ..."

1137
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:09,422
"I had some old red wine."

1138
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,797
"My friends tried to stop me..."

1139
01:02:11,922 --> 01:02:14,421
"I shouldn't get pushy."

1140
01:02:14,422 --> 01:02:16,505
"Listen to my last night's tale ..."

1141
01:02:16,797 --> 01:02:18,880
"I had some old red wine."

1142
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:21,422
"My friends tried to stop me..."

1143
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:23,797
"I shouldn't get pushy."

1144
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:26,380
"I met an angel..."

1145
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:28,755
"She said, come close to me."

1146
01:02:28,797 --> 01:02:33,672
"Tell me, is your heart missing?"

1147
01:02:33,922 --> 01:02:36,297
"My heart got stolen..."

1148
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:38,630
"What do I do?"

1149
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,005
"My heart got stolen..."

1150
01:02:41,047 --> 01:02:43,380
"What do I do?"

1151
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:45,921
"It's lost in someone's eyes..."

1152
01:02:45,922 --> 01:02:48,255
"What do I do?"

1153
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,672
"O madam, your gait..."

1154
01:02:50,755 --> 01:02:53,047
"Your silky tresses..."

1155
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:55,422
"What more do I say?"

1156
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:57,797
"I got inebriated..."

1157
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,130
"What do I do?"

1158
01:03:00,297 --> 01:03:02,547
"My heart got stolen..."

1159
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:05,297
"What do I do?"

1160
01:03:05,922 --> 01:03:09,547
"All guys and girls will mingle..."

1161
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:13,047
"When they will go crazy
and come to the dance floor."

1162
01:03:13,172 --> 01:03:17,005
"Everyone will shower money around..."

1163
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:20,505
"And they will zoom
and make videos of it."

1164
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,672
"All my friends and cousins..."

1165
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:26,047
"Let's celebrate the
pre-wedding ritual..."

1166
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,380
"A single heart I too seek..."

1167
01:03:28,547 --> 01:03:30,671
"For whom my heart shall beat."

1168
01:03:30,672 --> 01:03:33,005
"Many would form news
relationships today..."

1169
01:03:33,047 --> 01:03:35,338
"Those who are ogling around."

1170
01:03:35,422 --> 01:03:37,796
"You too are eyeing me..."

1171
01:03:37,797 --> 01:03:39,755
"Tell me what do I do?"

1172
01:03:39,797 --> 01:03:42,213
"My heart got stolen..."

1173
01:03:42,297 --> 01:03:44,671
"What do I do?"

1174
01:03:44,672 --> 01:03:47,005
"It's lost in someone's eyes..."

1175
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:49,380
"What do I do?"

1176
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:51,880
"O madam, your gait..."

1177
01:03:51,922 --> 01:03:54,088
"Your silky tresses..."

1178
01:03:54,172 --> 01:03:56,630
"What more do I say?"

1179
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:59,172
"I got inebriated..."

1180
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:01,422
"What do I do?"

1181
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:03,755
"My heart got stolen..."

1182
01:04:03,797 --> 01:04:06,297
"What do I do?"

1183
01:04:06,672 --> 01:04:08,297
"All..."

1184
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,380
"All night,
all liquor, I finished it all."

1185
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:13,838
"if it's your friend's wedding,
come party with me."

1186
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,130
"Tell me quietly, who'd hide shoes?"

1187
01:04:16,172 --> 01:04:18,463
"Whoever does it will get beaten up!"

1188
01:04:18,672 --> 01:04:20,921
"We have to create
a superb atmosphere."

1189
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:23,130
"We also have to make
all aunts and uncles dance."

1190
01:04:23,172 --> 01:04:25,755
"We will have a lot of fun."

1191
01:04:25,797 --> 01:04:28,213
"Get drunk, no one will say a thing."

1192
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:30,422
"Girls get cajoled
in a Punjabi wedding..."

1193
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:32,797
"There is free flowing liquor too."

1194
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,296
"As liquor is served,
it lasts till the end..."

1195
01:04:35,297 --> 01:04:37,380
"The catering guy will be in trouble,
my friend."

1196
01:04:37,422 --> 01:04:39,797
"My heart got stolen..."

1197
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,172
"What do I do?"

1198
01:04:42,255 --> 01:04:44,505
"My heart got stolen..."

1199
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,880
"What do I do?"

1200
01:04:47,047 --> 01:04:49,380
"It's lost in someone's eyes..."

1201
01:04:49,547 --> 01:04:51,880
"What do I do?"

1202
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:54,297
"O madam, your gait..."

1203
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,505
"Your silky tresses..."

1204
01:04:56,547 --> 01:04:59,130
"What more do I say?"

1205
01:04:59,172 --> 01:05:01,422
"I got inebriated..."

1206
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:03,797
"What do I do?"

1207
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:06,213
"My heart got stolen..."

1208
01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:08,547
"What do I do?"

1209
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:11,422
"Yo yo Honey Singh!"

1210
01:05:37,422 --> 01:05:38,422
I am sorry.

1211
01:05:40,172 --> 01:05:41,172
Why?

1212
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:44,297
Because you think I am cunning?

1213
01:05:45,047 --> 01:05:46,755
- No, I am...
- Well, I am.

1214
01:05:51,422 --> 01:05:52,422
Are you thinking...

1215
01:05:53,547 --> 01:05:54,827
why I'm telling this to you now?

1216
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,422
Just. I feel like
showing you your place.

1217
01:06:01,922 --> 01:06:04,547
Go, run, and tell Titu...

1218
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:06,797
Go.

1219
01:06:09,422 --> 01:06:10,422
What happened?

1220
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:11,963
Titu won't believe you?

1221
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,380
But you are his best
friend since childhood, right?

1222
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:17,652
And I have just come into your lives.

1223
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:20,047
Go.

1224
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:25,963
The engagement is done.

1225
01:06:26,922 --> 01:06:28,172
So will the marriage.

1226
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,141
And guess who'll be the first person
to get kicked out of Titu's life?

1227
01:07:47,422 --> 01:07:48,422
It's very nice.

1228
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:50,213
Do you like it, grandma?

1229
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:51,422
It's beautiful, dear.

1230
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:54,213
Get it registered and
start with the interiors.

1231
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,648
Under whose name will the registry be?

1232
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:57,672
Under a joint name.

1233
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,172
What do you mean by joint names?

1234
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:01,380
Yeah, Titu and mine.

1235
01:08:06,505 --> 01:08:09,130
I am leaving my house
and my family to be with him,

1236
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:11,255
The least I can get
is a little security.

1237
01:08:11,297 --> 01:08:12,880
You talk about security?

1238
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,773
You don't think there should be some trust
on the family you are about to join?

1239
01:08:15,797 --> 01:08:17,296
Trust is a two way street, mummy.

1240
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:19,648
If it's about trust then why
don't we register it in my name alone?

1241
01:08:19,672 --> 01:08:21,255
Did you hear what she said?

1242
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,481
They aren't even married yet and she
is already talking about separation?

1243
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:25,106
I always knew this
family is the wrong family.

1244
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:28,672
Who talks about splitting the wedding
expenses in the first meeting itself?

1245
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:31,605
What kind of a family have you
forged a relationship with, sister?

1246
01:08:32,005 --> 01:08:33,297
Titu is my grandson too!

1247
01:08:33,672 --> 01:08:35,005
I am not letting this happen!

1248
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:36,380
Enough!

1249
01:08:37,922 --> 01:08:42,005
All property registries in
this family have only seen one name,

1250
01:08:43,172 --> 01:08:44,505
Ghasitaram.

1251
01:08:44,547 --> 01:08:47,922
Go inform your father,
that this wedding

1252
01:08:48,005 --> 01:08:50,255
stands cancelled!

1253
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,910
What do you mean by joint names?

1254
01:09:11,297 --> 01:09:13,981
We've decided that our first home
should be in the names of the people..

1255
01:09:14,005 --> 01:09:15,645
Because of whom this has been possible.

1256
01:09:16,047 --> 01:09:17,588
Ma and grandma.

1257
01:09:22,255 --> 01:09:25,380
You mean Ma and grandma will
have to stand in the registry queue?

1258
01:09:25,797 --> 01:09:27,523
If they have to stand in the
queue when we have uncle Lalu..

1259
01:09:27,547 --> 01:09:30,880
Then it's a shame, right, uncle Lalu?

1260
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:34,820
The loan will get cleared on Monday,

1261
01:09:34,922 --> 01:09:36,380
We will register it on Wednesday.

1262
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,547
Loan?

1263
01:09:38,797 --> 01:09:42,047
Grandpa, you have
set up everything for us.

1264
01:09:43,755 --> 01:09:46,672
We wanted to build this house,
slowly, with our own money.

1265
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,360
What do you mean with your own money?

1266
01:09:49,088 --> 01:09:50,338
Who does this money belong to?

1267
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:52,672
You've learnt to
act like grown ups now?

1268
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:53,922
Lalu...

1269
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,547
Yes.

1270
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,981
Make the full payment tomorrow itself..

1271
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:58,165
And have it registered
under Sweety and Titu's name.

1272
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:01,296
We have built a house not to
see that my grand-daughter-in-law..

1273
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,630
Comes in a house bought with loan.

1274
01:10:04,255 --> 01:10:05,297
- Lalu...
- Yes.

1275
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,797
Make sure Sweety doesn't
have to go anywhere.

1276
01:10:28,297 --> 01:10:29,297
Yes.

1277
01:10:29,547 --> 01:10:31,627
They are going to make
the payment for the new house.

1278
01:10:31,755 --> 01:10:33,630
Ask grandma for fifty cash.

1279
01:10:45,047 --> 01:10:47,797
Grandma, need fifty cash for the house.

1280
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,672
- Lalu...
- Sweety...

1281
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:13,505
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1282
01:11:13,547 --> 01:11:16,046
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1283
01:11:16,047 --> 01:11:20,297
"Don't move like a bullet."

1284
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:26,338
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1285
01:11:26,422 --> 01:11:28,755
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1286
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:33,172
"Don't move like a bullet."

1287
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:36,963
"Twisty-curvy is the road."

1288
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:39,255
"Your speed is on super fast mode."

1289
01:11:39,297 --> 01:11:41,130
"There is no brake on your sandals."

1290
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:44,047
"Oh my God... oh my God..."

1291
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,796
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1292
01:11:45,797 --> 01:11:48,130
"Tread slowly, Sweety..."

1293
01:11:48,172 --> 01:11:52,630
"Don't move like a bullet."

1294
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:57,172
"This world is rude."

1295
01:11:58,297 --> 01:11:58,880
"Oh my..."

1296
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:01,088
"This world is rude."

1297
01:12:01,297 --> 01:12:03,255
"They will tease."

1298
01:12:03,422 --> 01:12:05,588
"Don't run like this..."

1299
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:07,880
"Listen to me, please."

1300
01:12:24,672 --> 01:12:27,297
Sweety... just a sec please.

1301
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,047
Hmm?

1302
01:12:37,672 --> 01:12:39,297
You've chosen the wrong battle.

1303
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:42,630
Well, the choice is made now.

1304
01:12:43,547 --> 01:12:44,880
But it's a sweet battle.

1305
01:12:45,422 --> 01:12:46,547
No one can hear you.

1306
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:48,130
Why're you acting?

1307
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:49,880
Acting?

1308
01:12:50,338 --> 01:12:51,338
What do you mean?

1309
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,047
What are you saying, Sonu?

1310
01:12:54,047 --> 01:12:55,505
You can try as much as you want.

1311
01:12:55,547 --> 01:12:57,227
I promise you I'll
break off this marriage.

1312
01:12:58,297 --> 01:13:00,213
What is wrong with you, Sonu?

1313
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,047
Please say that you're lying...

1314
01:13:07,297 --> 01:13:08,880
That you're joking.

1315
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:30,338
She is so cheap, Ghasitey,

1316
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,898
She has started recording
our conversations.

1317
01:13:31,922 --> 01:13:33,005
You do the same.

1318
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:35,630
It is not ethical.

1319
01:13:36,297 --> 01:13:38,005
I can't forget my ethics for this.

1320
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,500
There what would be the
difference between her and me?

1321
01:13:53,172 --> 01:13:55,172
Come Sonu,
Sweety has made curry for us.

1322
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:06,630
Sorry, Sweety,

1323
01:14:07,172 --> 01:14:08,172
I brought kebabs.

1324
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:11,422
Nothing beats kebabs!

1325
01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:36,273
Today I will make chicken
for Sonu and grandpa.

1326
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:36,838
Oh!

1327
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,922
They love it, don't they?

1328
01:14:38,047 --> 01:14:39,047
Absolutely.

1329
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:29,106
Rukmani, you asked me not
to eat meat on Tuesdays and I agreed.

1330
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,838
But this is so not fair!

1331
01:15:31,005 --> 01:15:32,880
- Lalu...
- Sister.

1332
01:15:33,297 --> 01:15:34,297
Throw it.

1333
01:15:35,172 --> 01:15:36,797
But this one is already dead!

1334
01:15:37,047 --> 01:15:38,797
Will you let its sacrifice go in vain?

1335
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,922
Lalu, you are under the oath of...

1336
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,422
No meat will be cooked or
brought inside this house henceforth.

1337
01:15:55,547 --> 01:15:57,380
Come on Manju, let's have dinner.

1338
01:16:02,755 --> 01:16:04,297
- Well I...
- Have an upset stomach?

1339
01:16:07,172 --> 01:16:09,005
I know where you go for your walks.

1340
01:16:09,422 --> 01:16:11,588
Quietly eat the dinner
or else I will tell grandma..

1341
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:14,350
That bond she shares with her
brother was traded for four percent.

1342
01:16:22,172 --> 01:16:23,505
Sweety has made Soya Chaap.

1343
01:16:23,672 --> 01:16:24,755
At least try it.

1344
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:26,005
They call it veg mutton.

1345
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,422
At Mayur Vihar, a boy promised a girl
to get married, and had sex with her.

1346
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:10,880
But didn't marry her.

1347
01:17:11,922 --> 01:17:12,922
So?

1348
01:17:13,172 --> 01:17:14,172
He's in jail now.

1349
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:18,255
Under section 375 it
is punishable offence to..

1350
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:20,380
Have sex by giving
a false promise of marriage.

1351
01:17:21,047 --> 01:17:22,505
Why are you telling me that?

1352
01:17:22,755 --> 01:17:23,755
Just.

1353
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:25,422
It was in the news.

1354
01:17:28,672 --> 01:17:29,672
Yes!

1355
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:31,630
You will lose.

1356
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:33,213
Excuse me.

1357
01:18:44,172 --> 01:18:44,755
I will be right back.

1358
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:45,922
Where are you going?

1359
01:18:46,172 --> 01:18:47,172
Inside.

1360
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,422
There is hardly any
time left for the wedding.

1361
01:18:50,422 --> 01:18:51,422
Don't do it.

1362
01:18:52,047 --> 01:18:53,047
What if she objects?

1363
01:18:53,172 --> 01:18:54,422
Have you lost your mind?

1364
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,880
I am just...

1365
01:18:56,422 --> 01:18:57,630
I'm not going that far.

1366
01:18:58,172 --> 01:18:59,172
Relax...

1367
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,380
What happened?

1368
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:04,755
I don't know.

1369
01:20:06,255 --> 01:20:07,672
I don't know what happened to me.

1370
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:15,838
What will she think of me now?

1371
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:40,463
It's okay.

1372
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,755
It's okay.

1373
01:20:48,047 --> 01:20:51,172
I know we decided to wait but it's us.

1374
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,047
I am already your wife, right?

1375
01:20:56,297 --> 01:20:58,422
We just make it official
on 22nd October.

1376
01:21:00,713 --> 01:21:01,713
I am sorry.

1377
01:21:01,922 --> 01:21:03,172
Are you mad?

1378
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,380
I love you.

1379
01:21:22,297 --> 01:21:23,380
I love you too.

1380
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:30,297
Now go and get ready.

1381
01:21:30,547 --> 01:21:31,547
Drop me home.

1382
01:21:49,255 --> 01:21:50,297
I am not the heroine...

1383
01:21:51,422 --> 01:21:52,505
lam the villain.

1384
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:54,463
Villain.

1385
01:21:56,297 --> 01:22:00,255
"Yes, I'm a villain."

1386
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:08,880
"I am not the hero, I am the villain!"

1387
01:22:10,755 --> 01:22:17,005
"I am not the hero, I am the villain!"

1388
01:22:18,922 --> 01:22:23,005
"I am cruel and vicious."

1389
01:22:23,047 --> 01:22:26,963
"I don't know about love"

1390
01:22:27,047 --> 01:22:31,838
"I'm just worthy of hatred."

1391
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:38,130
"I am not the hero, I am the villain!"

1392
01:22:38,172 --> 01:22:42,380
"I am cruel and vicious."

1393
01:22:46,172 --> 01:22:48,255
Ghasitey, she's won me over.

1394
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:49,797
What is wrong with him?

1395
01:22:50,172 --> 01:22:51,380
He is in shock.

1396
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:56,297
She made Titu do what
she wanted him to do.

1397
01:22:57,047 --> 01:23:00,005
And she made him do it in such a
way that Titu thinks he did it.

1398
01:23:01,297 --> 01:23:03,838
And Titu thinks that what he did,
is wrong.

1399
01:23:05,297 --> 01:23:08,922
Then to make Titu apologize,
she first forgave him.

1400
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:13,922
And when Titu started to apologize,
she even stopped him from doing that.

1401
01:23:15,255 --> 01:23:16,797
Hats off to that girl.

1402
01:23:17,547 --> 01:23:19,047
We should be taking lessons from her.

1403
01:23:19,463 --> 01:23:21,047
This woman is the greatest manipulator.

1404
01:23:22,755 --> 01:23:24,380
She deserves it, Ghasitey.

1405
01:23:24,422 --> 01:23:25,880
Let her get married.

1406
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:27,005
What do you mean let her?

1407
01:23:27,047 --> 01:23:28,047
I am not stopping her.

1408
01:23:28,048 --> 01:23:29,380
You cannot stop her either.

1409
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:30,755
I don't want to either.

1410
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:31,997
You're not even capable of it.

1411
01:23:34,547 --> 01:23:36,963
Lalu... how old are you?

1412
01:23:37,422 --> 01:23:38,422
68.

1413
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,838
You couldn't pull it for 28, kid.

1414
01:23:47,047 --> 01:23:49,047
I underestimated her.

1415
01:23:49,422 --> 01:23:51,755
Now I don't know how to prove it.

1416
01:23:51,797 --> 01:23:52,797
Look...

1417
01:23:53,047 --> 01:23:56,380
When you are losing the race,
it is better if you pretend to fall..

1418
01:23:57,297 --> 01:23:58,922
You get an excuse for your failure.

1419
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,255
You should back off.

1420
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:03,380
At least you will be
able to console yourself..

1421
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:06,385
That if you had fully tried, you
could have broken off their marriage.

1422
01:24:09,672 --> 01:24:10,672
Here...

1423
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,672
No ice, sore throat.

1424
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,630
Have it, you will feel better.

1425
01:24:14,922 --> 01:24:16,338
Poison fights poison.

1426
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,922
Titu, where is your passport?

1427
01:24:43,005 --> 01:24:43,922
Right here, why?

1428
01:24:43,923 --> 01:24:45,005
We are going to Amsterdam.

1429
01:24:45,422 --> 01:24:46,773
Not even 10 days left for the wedding.

1430
01:24:46,797 --> 01:24:47,957
They want to go to Amsterdam.

1431
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:49,047
This isn't a discussion.

1432
01:24:49,088 --> 01:24:49,755
I am informing everyone.

1433
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,547
Everything will be arranged.

1434
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:51,838
No one is going anywhere.

1435
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,129
The band is not finalized.

1436
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,481
Titu hasn't done the final
trial for his wedding outfit.

1437
01:24:54,505 --> 01:24:58,380
Mummy, forget Meerut, even
if I bring the best band in India..

1438
01:24:58,547 --> 01:25:00,547
They too will play
just that one song on repeat.

1439
01:25:00,672 --> 01:25:02,922
"This country of young brave men..."

1440
01:25:03,297 --> 01:25:06,130
And I promise that the groom
won't show up in his knickers.

1441
01:25:06,505 --> 01:25:08,922
I will have a tailor on location.

1442
01:25:09,547 --> 01:25:10,755
He has been possessed.

1443
01:25:12,422 --> 01:25:13,523
I have agreed to everything till now.

1444
01:25:13,547 --> 01:25:14,627
But this is non negotiable.

1445
01:25:15,255 --> 01:25:18,297
I am not letting Titu get
married without a bachelor's party.

1446
01:25:20,297 --> 01:25:23,922
Sweety, you tell them,
don't we deserve a bachelor party?

1447
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,880
How can I refuse?

1448
01:25:29,047 --> 01:25:30,607
I am stealing your
friend away from you.

1449
01:25:30,922 --> 01:25:32,463
I have to give you at least that much.

1450
01:25:33,505 --> 01:25:34,505
Sweety...

1451
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,172
I am mailing you the itinerary.

1452
01:25:41,297 --> 01:25:42,857
You'll book the tickets
for this, right?

1453
01:26:04,547 --> 01:26:06,630
They have hardly faced the real world.

1454
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:08,547
They are only kids.

1455
01:26:08,755 --> 01:26:09,915
They have just aged a little.

1456
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:12,588
They've never been to Bangkok,

1457
01:26:13,005 --> 01:26:16,255
I hope they don't go
overboard in Amsterdam.

1458
01:26:16,297 --> 01:26:18,380
There's hardly any
days left for the wedding.

1459
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,922
Are you understanding?

1460
01:26:21,297 --> 01:26:22,297
Yes, I am.

1461
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:23,547
Lalu...

1462
01:26:23,547 --> 01:26:24,172
Yes.

1463
01:26:24,255 --> 01:26:25,505
Get your passports.

1464
01:26:25,797 --> 01:26:26,963
You too will go with him.

1465
01:26:31,297 --> 01:26:33,148
But there is a lot of
work to be done here as well.

1466
01:26:33,172 --> 01:26:34,255
Let him go alone.

1467
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:35,880
I can smell it burn.

1468
01:26:36,047 --> 01:26:37,047
Right.

1469
01:26:37,297 --> 01:26:38,422
You stay back then.

1470
01:26:43,005 --> 01:26:44,005
Your medicines?

1471
01:26:44,047 --> 01:26:45,380
Write them down for him.

1472
01:26:49,255 --> 01:26:50,672
And outside food...?

1473
01:26:50,922 --> 01:26:52,297
It's Europe, Lalu.

1474
01:26:52,797 --> 01:26:54,380
Even outside food is healthy there.

1475
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,380
Yes.

1476
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:00,255
You want to go?

1477
01:27:00,672 --> 01:27:01,463
Yes.

1478
01:27:01,672 --> 01:27:03,047
Then stop the drama.

1479
01:27:03,922 --> 01:27:05,088
Okay, sister.

1480
01:27:05,297 --> 01:27:06,297
Hey, you!

1481
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:07,922
Come.

1482
01:27:11,422 --> 01:27:12,505
We fly business.

1483
01:27:14,172 --> 01:27:15,172
Go.

1484
01:28:15,672 --> 01:28:19,255
"She has long silky hair."

1485
01:28:19,297 --> 01:28:21,922
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1486
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,421
"Who's dancing there?"

1487
01:28:23,422 --> 01:28:26,630
"She has an awesome
tattoo on her waist."

1488
01:28:26,672 --> 01:28:29,380
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1489
01:28:29,422 --> 01:28:31,255
"Who's dancing there?"

1490
01:28:50,922 --> 01:28:51,922
Hi!

1491
01:28:52,047 --> 01:28:52,630
Hi.

1492
01:28:52,672 --> 01:28:53,797
Congrats.

1493
01:28:54,172 --> 01:28:54,797
For?

1494
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:55,797
For?

1495
01:28:55,922 --> 01:28:57,630
Forgotten as soon
as you reached Amsterdam?

1496
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:59,023
Sonu told me that
you're getting married.

1497
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:00,172
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1498
01:29:00,297 --> 01:29:00,963
Thanks.

1499
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:02,172
So, what's her name?

1500
01:29:02,297 --> 01:29:03,297
<i>Sweaty Sharma.</i>

1501
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:04,547
Already Sharma?

1502
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:06,922
No, she is also a Sharma.

1503
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:08,797
I mean from before.

1504
01:29:09,255 --> 01:29:10,255
From before!

1505
01:29:11,172 --> 01:29:12,172
Perfect.

1506
01:29:12,922 --> 01:29:14,172
What are you doing here?

1507
01:29:14,505 --> 01:29:15,505
Holiday!

1508
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,630
With whom?

1509
01:29:22,755 --> 01:29:23,797
I've come alone.

1510
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,380
Excuse me.

1511
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:43,672
I've come alone.

1512
01:29:44,672 --> 01:29:46,005
I've come alone!

1513
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:47,380
It's not a sad statement.

1514
01:29:47,422 --> 01:29:48,713
You're supposed to look happy

1515
01:29:48,755 --> 01:29:50,047
I've come alone!

1516
01:29:53,672 --> 01:29:54,547
What happened?

1517
01:29:54,672 --> 01:29:56,422
Stop crying, Pihu.
What if Titu sees you.

1518
01:29:56,797 --> 01:29:57,963
What do you mean stop it?

1519
01:29:58,255 --> 01:29:59,255
It's not a tap!

1520
01:29:59,422 --> 01:30:00,630
It's just happening!

1521
01:30:00,672 --> 01:30:03,380
Look, if you cry he will think
that you still have feelings for him.

1522
01:30:03,422 --> 01:30:05,047
But I do.

1523
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:06,380
That's why I am here.

1524
01:30:06,422 --> 01:30:08,297
Yes, but he cannot know that.

1525
01:30:08,505 --> 01:30:10,380
You need to show him
that you have moved on.

1526
01:30:10,547 --> 01:30:12,505
Only then will he spend time with you.

1527
01:30:12,672 --> 01:30:14,672
Look, be it a girl or a boy..

1528
01:30:15,172 --> 01:30:17,648
One feels sad about losing
their ex only upon seeing them happy.

1529
01:30:17,672 --> 01:30:19,296
Only then do you feel
like getting him back.

1530
01:30:19,297 --> 01:30:20,297
Try to understand.

1531
01:30:20,547 --> 01:30:22,338
He is happy with Sweety, Sonu.

1532
01:30:22,547 --> 01:30:24,130
I saw it in his eyes.

1533
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:26,481
And I am here dancing in
a backless dress for no reason!

1534
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:28,047
Hey, listen, calm down.

1535
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:29,922
Does anyone know Titu better than me?

1536
01:30:30,297 --> 01:30:32,047
He still loves you.

1537
01:30:32,297 --> 01:30:33,755
He's getting married in a rebound.

1538
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,200
And he doesn't realize it either.

1539
01:30:35,547 --> 01:30:38,547
I've always believed that
you and Titu are made for each other.

1540
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:40,880
And it just got confirmed
when I saw him with Sweety.

1541
01:30:41,297 --> 01:30:43,130
And the way he looked at you today...

1542
01:30:43,422 --> 01:30:47,047
I was sure that if Titu belongs
to a girl, that girl is Pihu!

1543
01:30:48,922 --> 01:30:50,130
Please don't get distracted.

1544
01:30:50,505 --> 01:30:51,755
Let me strategize this.

1545
01:30:51,797 --> 01:30:53,130
You stay in your character.

1546
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:55,587
I brought you here, right?

1547
01:30:56,172 --> 01:30:58,630
I guarantee you that I'll get you Titu.

1548
01:30:58,672 --> 01:30:59,880
I promise.

1549
01:31:00,547 --> 01:31:02,672
Just do as I say.

1550
01:31:03,255 --> 01:31:04,255
Got it?

1551
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:05,672
Now wipe your tears...

1552
01:31:06,255 --> 01:31:08,005
And come two minutes after me..

1553
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:09,887
And say that you
had got a call from Anshul.

1554
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:10,922
Who's Anshul?

1555
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,422
The guy from your office.

1556
01:31:12,797 --> 01:31:13,880
I don't see the connection.

1557
01:31:13,922 --> 01:31:14,922
Again?

1558
01:31:15,047 --> 01:31:16,338
You won't get Titu like this.

1559
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:19,012
You won't be able to
do this if you over think.

1560
01:31:19,047 --> 01:31:20,172
You want Titu, right?

1561
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,880
Then follow me.

1562
01:31:23,297 --> 01:31:24,505
Huh... follow...

1563
01:31:25,672 --> 01:31:26,880
Come after two minutes.

1564
01:31:31,922 --> 01:31:33,380
- Did you see her anywhere?
- No.

1565
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:35,422
Two shots, please.

1566
01:31:36,672 --> 01:31:38,792
I think she got a little
uncomfortable upon seeing me.

1567
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,880
Hi.

1568
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:46,356
Sorry, had to attend a call.

1569
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,422
Boyfriend?

1570
01:31:47,797 --> 01:31:48,797
Anshul.

1571
01:31:49,172 --> 01:31:50,630
Y'all have met him too.

1572
01:31:51,922 --> 01:31:53,838
Oh yes, at the pub, right?

1573
01:31:56,672 --> 01:31:57,672
Shots!

1574
01:32:06,797 --> 01:32:07,797
My song!

1575
01:32:19,672 --> 01:32:21,505
Now just get drunk and make a mess!

1576
01:32:21,547 --> 01:32:22,547
I'll handle the rest.

1577
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:24,505
They're crooks,
mixing water in the drinks

1578
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:27,047
8 shots down,
haven't even started to feel drunk.

1579
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:29,547
And now you're a method actor.

1580
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:31,505
Can't even pretend to be drunk.

1581
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,797
He's looking here.

1582
01:32:36,047 --> 01:32:37,005
Shall I call him?

1583
01:32:37,047 --> 01:32:38,380
Not yet, wait.

1584
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:42,880
Now. Call him.

1585
01:32:45,172 --> 01:32:46,630
Drag him here.

1586
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:58,672
You are getting married.

1587
01:33:00,422 --> 01:33:01,422
Come on.

1588
01:33:15,547 --> 01:33:16,672
What is this?

1589
01:33:17,797 --> 01:33:18,797
Poison.

1590
01:33:20,922 --> 01:33:22,172
You told me remember.

1591
01:33:22,422 --> 01:33:24,172
That only poison fights poison.

1592
01:33:28,255 --> 01:33:30,505
How is this poison
better than that poison?

1593
01:33:30,672 --> 01:33:32,255
I have tasted this poison.

1594
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:35,547
And even spewed it out when needed.

1595
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:37,797
And most importantly Ghasitey.

1596
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:40,422
She never challenged me.

1597
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,422
Come on, let's go.

1598
01:33:47,547 --> 01:33:49,421
Ghasitey didn't like this place.
We're leaving.

1599
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:51,255
Shots! Shots!

1600
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,380
No!

1601
01:33:52,922 --> 01:33:54,047
She's coming with us?

1602
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:57,088
You want to leave
her alone in this state?

1603
01:33:59,547 --> 01:34:00,797
I mean it's your call.

1604
01:34:01,047 --> 01:34:03,338
I can tell her not to
come if you feel uncomfortable.

1605
01:34:35,755 --> 01:34:37,422
Titu... Titu...

1606
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,755
Titu... Titu...

1607
01:34:50,297 --> 01:34:51,380
Just a moment...

1608
01:34:56,047 --> 01:34:57,213
Good night.

1609
01:35:00,922 --> 01:35:02,630
- Titu, you are so sweet.
- Okay.

1610
01:35:02,672 --> 01:35:03,672
Go to sleep.

1611
01:35:05,005 --> 01:35:06,005
Good night.

1612
01:35:15,797 --> 01:35:16,463
<i>Yes, Sweaty'?</i>

1613
01:35:16,505 --> 01:35:18,005
- Sonu?
- My Sister-in-law!

1614
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:19,606
Titu is at his bachelor party.

1615
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:20,422
He cannot take your call.

1616
01:35:20,547 --> 01:35:21,005
Give it to me.

1617
01:35:21,047 --> 01:35:22,630
No phone calls for the next three days.

1618
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,672
Don't you worry.

1619
01:35:24,755 --> 01:35:27,380
I took good care of him
before you showed up, didn't I?

1620
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:29,355
I can do that for
another three days too.

1621
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:30,505
Bye.

1622
01:35:32,172 --> 01:35:34,047
No phone calls for the next three days.

1623
01:35:46,005 --> 01:35:49,546
"She has long silky hair."

1624
01:35:49,547 --> 01:35:52,172
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1625
01:35:52,297 --> 01:35:53,672
"Who's dancing there?"

1626
01:35:53,755 --> 01:35:57,046
"She has an awesome
tattoo on her waist."

1627
01:35:57,047 --> 01:35:59,672
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1628
01:35:59,755 --> 01:36:01,130
"Who's dancing there?"

1629
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:04,547
"She has long silky hair."

1630
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:06,880
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1631
01:36:07,297 --> 01:36:08,588
"Who's dancing there?"

1632
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:12,046
"She has an awesome
tattoo on her waist."

1633
01:36:12,047 --> 01:36:14,630
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1634
01:36:14,797 --> 01:36:15,921
"Who's dancing there?"

1635
01:36:15,922 --> 01:36:19,797
"I fell for you, how is it my fault?"

1636
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:23,547
"You are my love, how is my fault?"

1637
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:27,130
"What do you feel about me?"

1638
01:36:27,172 --> 01:36:29,796
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1639
01:36:29,797 --> 01:36:31,630
"Who's dancing there?"

1640
01:36:46,922 --> 01:36:50,547
"Your attitude is worth millions."

1641
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:53,505
"Your swag is out of this world."

1642
01:36:53,547 --> 01:36:57,005
"She's causing a storm in the club."

1643
01:36:57,047 --> 01:36:59,588
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1644
01:36:59,672 --> 01:37:00,880
"Who's dancing there?"

1645
01:37:00,922 --> 01:37:04,255
"She has long silky hair."

1646
01:37:04,297 --> 01:37:07,255
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1647
01:37:07,297 --> 01:37:08,713
"Who's dancing there?"

1648
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,505
"Why don't you open your heart for me?"

1649
01:37:20,672 --> 01:37:24,338
"Why don't you say
sweet nothings to me?"

1650
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:28,422
"Why don't you...?"

1651
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:35,630
"Why don't you open your heart for me?"

1652
01:37:35,672 --> 01:37:38,546
"Why don't you say
sweet nothings to me?"

1653
01:37:38,547 --> 01:37:42,047
"She is still a mystery for me."

1654
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,547
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1655
01:37:44,672 --> 01:37:46,047
"Who's dancing there?"

1656
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:49,546
"She has long silky hair."

1657
01:37:49,547 --> 01:37:52,255
"Who's that girl dancing there?"

1658
01:37:52,297 --> 01:37:53,630
"Who's dancing there?"

1659
01:38:07,547 --> 01:38:08,672
Done packing?

1660
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,047
Yes, done.

1661
01:38:13,672 --> 01:38:14,880
I really had a great time.

1662
01:38:15,172 --> 01:38:15,880
Me too.

1663
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:16,672
Liar.

1664
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,255
I ruined your party.

1665
01:38:18,422 --> 01:38:20,106
You got stuck with
your ex at your bachelor's.

1666
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,356
Didn't even get to do anything.

1667
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:22,547
I didn't want to do anything.

1668
01:38:23,505 --> 01:38:25,630
But I just feel weird
that Sweety doesn't know.

1669
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:26,880
You didn't tell her?

1670
01:38:26,922 --> 01:38:28,755
Sonu has my phone since
the past three days.

1671
01:38:29,922 --> 01:38:31,047
But I think she'll be fine.

1672
01:38:32,005 --> 01:38:33,255
So what will you tell her?

1673
01:38:33,297 --> 01:38:34,338
That we are friends now?

1674
01:38:35,047 --> 01:38:36,630
What are you two talking about?

1675
01:38:36,922 --> 01:38:38,642
This scoundrel says
that we are friends now.

1676
01:38:38,797 --> 01:38:40,648
He is getting married...
and hasn't even invited me for it.

1677
01:38:40,672 --> 01:38:41,731
And he says that we are friends.

1678
01:38:41,755 --> 01:38:43,130
What are you saying?

1679
01:38:43,547 --> 01:38:44,630
Who is he to invite you?

1680
01:38:44,672 --> 01:38:45,797
I am inviting you,

1681
01:38:46,005 --> 01:38:47,297
Please be my guest.

1682
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,005
Only you love me truly!

1683
01:38:50,547 --> 01:38:52,422
Okay then, I'll go and pack.

1684
01:38:56,755 --> 01:38:57,922
Have you lost it?

1685
01:38:58,380 --> 01:38:59,255
What?

1686
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,422
Why would you invite her?

1687
01:39:00,547 --> 01:39:02,672
The way she said it,
did I have a choice?

1688
01:39:03,172 --> 01:39:04,547
But why are you worried?

1689
01:39:06,297 --> 01:39:07,547
Tell me the truth...

1690
01:39:08,172 --> 01:39:09,838
Do you still have feelings for her?

1691
01:39:10,005 --> 01:39:11,172
Are you mad?

1692
01:39:12,297 --> 01:39:13,255
It just feels a little odd.

1693
01:39:13,297 --> 01:39:16,137
Look, if you have no feelings for
her then you shouldn't have a problem.

1694
01:39:16,297 --> 01:39:18,897
But if you have a problem, then
that means that you have feelings.

1695
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,463
You decide.

1696
01:39:20,505 --> 01:39:21,671
I can ask her not to come, but...

1697
01:39:21,672 --> 01:39:22,672
Let her come.

1698
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,880
As you wish.

1699
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:03,547
Sweety, you! Here!

1700
01:40:03,672 --> 01:40:04,880
What a surprise!

1701
01:40:05,047 --> 01:40:06,505
Sweety, Pihu.

1702
01:40:06,547 --> 01:40:08,588
A very old friend of Titu's.

1703
01:40:08,797 --> 01:40:09,797
I know.

1704
01:40:10,172 --> 01:40:11,255
Titu told me.

1705
01:40:12,755 --> 01:40:13,755
Hi.

1706
01:40:15,922 --> 01:40:16,880
We bumped into her,

1707
01:40:16,922 --> 01:40:19,402
She was coming back to Delhi,
so I invited her for the wedding.

1708
01:40:20,422 --> 01:40:23,797
- Hi, I am Shalu, Sweety's cousin.
- Pihu. Hi.

1709
01:40:24,297 --> 01:40:25,297
Shall we?

1710
01:40:42,547 --> 01:40:43,630
Come, Titu.

1711
01:41:26,922 --> 01:41:28,172
Sister-in-law Pihu...

1712
01:41:29,797 --> 01:41:30,713
Sister, how are you?

1713
01:41:30,755 --> 01:41:32,005
- How are you, Babbu?
- Fine.

1714
01:41:32,047 --> 01:41:33,130
How is you mother-in-law?

1715
01:41:33,172 --> 01:41:33,672
Good.

1716
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:34,797
Good.

1717
01:41:37,047 --> 01:41:38,047
Keep it in.

1718
01:41:39,922 --> 01:41:40,922
Come on...

1719
01:41:41,922 --> 01:41:42,922
Get the bags.

1720
01:41:54,422 --> 01:41:55,422
"Go for it!"

1721
01:42:07,505 --> 01:42:09,130
You had made tall
claims before leaving.

1722
01:42:09,172 --> 01:42:10,838
"I'll do this! I'll do that!"

1723
01:42:10,922 --> 01:42:11,963
Where's your tailor?

1724
01:42:12,047 --> 01:42:13,422
Grandma was right.

1725
01:42:13,547 --> 01:42:15,463
You only know how to ruin weddings.

1726
01:42:18,797 --> 01:42:19,922
Isn't that her?

1727
01:42:20,047 --> 01:42:21,047
Who?

1728
01:42:22,422 --> 01:42:23,505
When did you meet her?

1729
01:42:23,547 --> 01:42:25,130
I have Facebook too.

1730
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:27,005
What is she doing her?

1731
01:42:27,297 --> 01:42:28,671
We bumped into her,

1732
01:42:28,672 --> 01:42:29,380
She was coming back to Delhi,

1733
01:42:29,422 --> 01:42:30,523
Titu invited her for the wedding.

1734
01:42:30,547 --> 01:42:33,547
Every half an hour mummy
gets these dhols started.

1735
01:42:33,672 --> 01:42:36,755
Even the Ghazal night yesterday
became a Bhangra night.

1736
01:42:37,005 --> 01:42:37,630
What?

1737
01:42:37,672 --> 01:42:38,672
Mummy!

1738
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:40,672
Who is she?

1739
01:42:40,797 --> 01:42:41,797
Pihu.

1740
01:42:42,755 --> 01:42:43,755
OH!

1741
01:42:46,797 --> 01:42:48,255
- Who is she?
- What?

1742
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,380
Who is she?

1743
01:42:49,422 --> 01:42:51,172
She's Titu and Sonu's friend.

1744
01:42:52,797 --> 01:42:53,797
Is she single?

1745
01:42:56,672 --> 01:42:57,922
- Titu, my bag.
- Grandma...

1746
01:42:58,047 --> 01:42:59,505
Grandma, Pihu.

1747
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:01,630
An old friend of ours.

1748
01:43:01,672 --> 01:43:02,380
We bumped into her,

1749
01:43:02,505 --> 01:43:03,130
She was coming back to Delhi,

1750
01:43:03,172 --> 01:43:04,273
So we invited her for the wedding.

1751
01:43:04,297 --> 01:43:05,505
Very good.

1752
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:06,797
She is a very nice girl.

1753
01:43:07,047 --> 01:43:08,398
You will be staying with us, right?

1754
01:43:08,422 --> 01:43:10,338
- Yes, I mean...
- Stay with us.

1755
01:43:10,755 --> 01:43:11,380
Okay.

1756
01:43:11,422 --> 01:43:12,380
I have a dance performance
on the musical night.

1757
01:43:12,422 --> 01:43:13,422
You teach me.

1758
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:14,880
Just dance, grandma?

1759
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:16,088
You should hear her sing.

1760
01:43:16,130 --> 01:43:17,297
She is an amazing singer.

1761
01:43:17,422 --> 01:43:18,047
Oh.

1762
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:22,130
"This... this is a world of brass..."

1763
01:43:22,422 --> 01:43:24,630
"This is a world of brass..."

1764
01:43:24,797 --> 01:43:27,130
"And I am a golden baby doll."

1765
01:43:27,172 --> 01:43:29,380
"I am a golden baby doll."

1766
01:43:29,505 --> 01:43:30,671
"I am a golden baby doll."

1767
01:43:30,672 --> 01:43:31,672
Oh.

1768
01:43:31,755 --> 01:43:34,047
"I am a golden baby doll."

1769
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,005
I'll get you some water.

1770
01:43:36,047 --> 01:43:37,047
Yes, dear.

1771
01:43:38,797 --> 01:43:40,922
- Grandma...
- Hey.

1772
01:43:42,547 --> 01:43:44,005
Come, I'll show you your room.

1773
01:43:48,547 --> 01:43:51,005
Oh! I'm soo exhausted.

1774
01:43:52,422 --> 01:43:53,797
Have you lost your mind, Titu?

1775
01:43:53,922 --> 01:43:55,922
Who invites his ex-girlfriend
for his wedding?

1776
01:43:56,005 --> 01:43:57,773
How will Sweety's family
react when they find out?

1777
01:43:57,797 --> 01:43:59,505
- I didn't...
- She cannot stay here.

1778
01:43:59,588 --> 01:44:00,731
If Titu doesn't have a problem,
why are you...

1779
01:44:00,755 --> 01:44:01,672
<i>Does Sweaty know'?</i>

1780
01:44:01,755 --> 01:44:02,255
Know what?

1781
01:44:02,297 --> 01:44:03,172
That she is his ex?

1782
01:44:03,297 --> 01:44:04,755
Of course she knows.

1783
01:44:04,797 --> 01:44:06,255
He never hides anything from Sweety.

1784
01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:07,814
Titu may not have
a problem but Sweety can.

1785
01:44:07,838 --> 01:44:08,838
Oh.

1786
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:09,922
Sweety.

1787
01:44:10,005 --> 01:44:11,005
What are you doing?

1788
01:44:12,255 --> 01:44:13,547
What are you doing?

1789
01:44:16,422 --> 01:44:19,047
Mummy feels that you might
have a problem with Pihu staying here.

1790
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:22,505
Not at all, mummy.

1791
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:23,172
Happy?

1792
01:44:23,255 --> 01:44:24,922
They have already become friends.

1793
01:44:34,505 --> 01:44:38,422
Do you think that Titu
still has feelings for Pihu?

1794
01:44:46,422 --> 01:44:48,630
"She's a golden baby doll."

1795
01:44:48,672 --> 01:44:51,130
"She's a golden baby doll."

1796
01:45:01,047 --> 01:45:02,407
That sari was looking good on you.

1797
01:45:04,505 --> 01:45:06,172
I never wore one after the betrothal.

1798
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,255
So I thought I should...

1799
01:45:08,505 --> 01:45:09,547
Then why did you change?

1800
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:12,255
Uncomfortable.

1801
01:45:14,547 --> 01:45:16,172
Should I ask Pihu not to stay here?

1802
01:45:17,047 --> 01:45:18,088
What if she agrees?

1803
01:45:18,922 --> 01:45:19,922
Why?

1804
01:45:21,172 --> 01:45:22,213
No chance.

1805
01:45:23,005 --> 01:45:24,047
Uncomfortable?

1806
01:45:25,422 --> 01:45:26,422
Are you?

1807
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:27,880
No.

1808
01:45:28,005 --> 01:45:29,755
She'll look weak if she agrees.

1809
01:45:30,797 --> 01:45:32,005
Then why will I be?

1810
01:45:43,005 --> 01:45:44,172
Go and change.

1811
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,630
Why?

1812
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:46,672
Go.

1813
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,380
Okay.

1814
01:45:53,672 --> 01:45:54,130
Hey...

1815
01:45:54,213 --> 01:45:54,672
Where to?

1816
01:45:54,755 --> 01:45:55,463
Shopping-

1817
01:45:55,755 --> 01:45:58,213
I can't wear my Amsterdam
clothes at the wedding.

1818
01:45:59,422 --> 01:46:00,547
Come on, sister-in-law.

1819
01:46:04,047 --> 01:46:05,047
Oh!

1820
01:46:41,505 --> 01:46:42,505
Can I ask you something?

1821
01:46:42,630 --> 01:46:43,630
Hmm.

1822
01:46:45,922 --> 01:46:48,672
What's the difference
between Sweety and me?

1823
01:46:52,672 --> 01:46:53,755
Does she love you more?

1824
01:46:56,172 --> 01:46:57,547
Does she take better care of you?

1825
01:46:59,547 --> 01:47:00,547
Why do you ask?

1826
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,630
Just.

1827
01:47:02,422 --> 01:47:03,422
Just want to know.

1828
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:06,797
What is it I did,
or what it is I did not do,

1829
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:11,082
That it's her name on the
wedding card instead of mine.

1830
01:47:29,755 --> 01:47:30,547
How've you been?

1831
01:47:30,672 --> 01:47:31,297
I hate doing this.

1832
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,672
- But we will do it.
- Sure.

1833
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:38,380
Hold on.

1834
01:47:39,797 --> 01:47:41,023
Let me know if anyone needs anything,

1835
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:42,171
Titu's near home.

1836
01:47:42,172 --> 01:47:43,255
Can he go to Sarojini?

1837
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:45,255
Why not, auntie? Of course he can

1838
01:47:45,422 --> 01:47:46,505
I'll message the address,

1839
01:47:46,547 --> 01:47:47,648
I have to get a dressed picked up

1840
01:47:47,672 --> 01:47:49,356
I'm sending you an address.
Pick up a dress.

1841
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,356
If he is going to Sarojini
then CP is right next to it,

1842
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,797
Hop skip and jump.

1843
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:53,755
Tell me, what do you want?

1844
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:55,046
I feel like having Wenger's pastry.

1845
01:47:55,047 --> 01:47:56,005
It's the best.

1846
01:47:56,047 --> 01:47:57,922
Write down what everyone
wants and give me.

1847
01:47:58,130 --> 01:47:59,380
Sweety, do you want anything?

1848
01:47:59,505 --> 01:48:00,422
Titu-Pihu are close to home.

1849
01:48:00,505 --> 01:48:01,797
Titu-Pihu can get it.

1850
01:48:03,047 --> 01:48:04,838
Titu knows what I like from there.

1851
01:48:05,172 --> 01:48:07,332
Aunt's mobile phone was
given for repair in Karol Bagh.

1852
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:08,523
Ask them to get that as well.

1853
01:48:08,547 --> 01:48:12,047
Titu, aunt's mobile phone
is given for repair in Karol Bagh.

1854
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:12,880
Get that as well.

1855
01:48:12,922 --> 01:48:16,380
And wait, let me ask dad as well.

1856
01:48:27,422 --> 01:48:28,422
Sweety...

1857
01:48:29,047 --> 01:48:30,130
Strolling in the garden?

1858
01:48:30,422 --> 01:48:31,422
So late in the night?

1859
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:33,047
That too all by yourself?

1860
01:48:34,922 --> 01:48:36,130
Has Titu still not returned?

1861
01:48:45,047 --> 01:48:48,172
HeenaGulati91 says, best couple ever.

1862
01:48:49,297 --> 01:48:50,755
I totally agree with Heena.

1863
01:48:51,172 --> 01:48:52,380
Do you have any kohl?

1864
01:48:54,547 --> 01:48:56,047
There are just 48 hours left.

1865
01:48:57,047 --> 01:49:00,547
Try convincing <i>as</i> many people
as you can to agree with Heena.

1866
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:03,505
I just need to convince one.

1867
01:49:03,922 --> 01:49:05,297
<i>Where have you been, Thu'?</i>

1868
01:49:05,547 --> 01:49:07,088
Sweety has been waiting for you.

1869
01:49:07,172 --> 01:49:08,630
She didn't even eat.

1870
01:49:08,797 --> 01:49:10,130
Go have dinner with her first.

1871
01:49:10,255 --> 01:49:12,797
One more bite and he'll burst.

1872
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:14,213
She eats more than me.

1873
01:49:14,255 --> 01:49:15,505
She even ate from the parcel.

1874
01:49:16,505 --> 01:49:18,297
I hope she didn't eat my pastry.

1875
01:49:18,547 --> 01:49:19,463
Your pastry?

1876
01:49:19,505 --> 01:49:21,255
Sorry, it wasn't
mentioned in the message.

1877
01:49:35,047 --> 01:49:37,713
Can you carry my bags to my bedroom?

1878
01:49:37,755 --> 01:49:38,797
Yes, let's go to sleep.

1879
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,480
We have to get up
early morning tomorrow.

1880
01:49:50,297 --> 01:49:54,505
"These troublesome bangles
won't stop clinking today."

1881
01:49:54,547 --> 01:49:56,547
"My wrist will stay out of reach."

1882
01:49:56,672 --> 01:49:58,672
"You won't be able to hold them."

1883
01:49:58,755 --> 01:50:02,672
"These troublesome bangles
won't stop clinking today."

1884
01:50:02,797 --> 01:50:04,880
"My wrist will stay out of reach."

1885
01:50:04,922 --> 01:50:07,005
"You won't be able to hold them."

1886
01:50:11,047 --> 01:50:13,046
"You have your attention
focused at me."

1887
01:50:13,047 --> 01:50:15,630
"I look ravishing today."

1888
01:50:19,255 --> 01:50:23,880
"You insist on dancing only with me."

1889
01:50:27,672 --> 01:50:29,713
"You have your attention
focused at me."

1890
01:50:29,755 --> 01:50:31,796
"I look ravishing today."

1891
01:50:31,797 --> 01:50:36,005
"You insist on dancing only with me."

1892
01:50:36,047 --> 01:50:38,088
"Hey drunkard..."

1893
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,047
"We are inviting trouble today."

1894
01:50:40,130 --> 01:50:44,880
"We swing a little to the
beats of the drum with the group."

1895
01:50:46,672 --> 01:50:48,755
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1896
01:50:48,797 --> 01:50:50,755
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1897
01:50:50,797 --> 01:50:52,880
"They fit well to
the beats of your drums."

1898
01:50:52,922 --> 01:50:54,921
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1899
01:50:54,922 --> 01:50:56,880
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1900
01:50:57,005 --> 01:50:59,047
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1901
01:50:59,130 --> 01:51:01,255
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1902
01:51:01,297 --> 01:51:03,713
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1903
01:51:11,547 --> 01:51:15,921
"I am called a beauty queen here."

1904
01:51:15,922 --> 01:51:19,630
"I am up to date with
the latest fashion."

1905
01:51:19,672 --> 01:51:21,630
"My dresses are imported."

1906
01:51:21,755 --> 01:51:23,921
"I am here to steal hearts."

1907
01:51:23,922 --> 01:51:30,005
"Whenever you praise me,
I feel a little shy, beloved..."

1908
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:32,172
"My moves..."

1909
01:51:32,630 --> 01:51:34,630
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1910
01:51:34,672 --> 01:51:36,630
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1911
01:51:36,755 --> 01:51:38,797
"They fit well to
the beats of your drums."

1912
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,922
"My moves are a hit, beloved..."

1913
01:51:41,047 --> 01:51:43,005
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1914
01:51:43,047 --> 01:51:45,047
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1915
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:47,047
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1916
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:49,672
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1917
01:51:57,755 --> 01:51:59,671
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1918
01:51:59,672 --> 01:52:01,755
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1919
01:52:01,797 --> 01:52:03,672
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1920
01:52:03,797 --> 01:52:06,130
"Your moves are a hit, dear..."

1921
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:07,463
Why did you break up with me?

1922
01:54:16,505 --> 01:54:18,755
My being in Amsterdam
was no coincidence.

1923
01:54:19,797 --> 01:54:21,130
Sonu called me there.

1924
01:54:25,547 --> 01:54:26,005
He said:

1925
01:54:26,047 --> 01:54:28,922
"Titu was depressed for
months after breaking up with you.

1926
01:54:29,297 --> 01:54:31,005
Then he agreed for an arranged marriage.

1927
01:54:32,297 --> 01:54:33,672
He still loves you.

1928
01:54:38,297 --> 01:54:40,255
You and Titu make a perfect couple.

1929
01:54:40,797 --> 01:54:42,157
I promise to get Titu back to you.

1930
01:54:42,922 --> 01:54:45,130
You just follow me.

1931
01:54:48,797 --> 01:54:52,005
And I, like a fool, just to
see my name on the wedding card...

1932
01:54:52,047 --> 01:54:53,713
kept agreeing with everything he said.

1933
01:54:54,505 --> 01:54:57,422
He said Sweety is the wrong girl,
and I believed him.

1934
01:54:57,922 --> 01:55:00,672
He said Titu is unhappy with her,
and I believed him.

1935
01:55:01,297 --> 01:55:05,588
He said Titu still loves you,
and I believed him.

1936
01:55:09,505 --> 01:55:11,005
I am such a fool.

1937
01:55:11,422 --> 01:55:13,102
The same person who
took you away from me..

1938
01:55:13,172 --> 01:55:16,172
Promised to help me get you back,
and I believed him.

1939
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:22,922
I am stupid, I am selfish too,

1940
01:55:26,922 --> 01:55:28,047
But I am not a wretch.

1941
01:55:44,672 --> 01:55:47,505
Titu, I know what this looks like,
but I had no other option.

1942
01:55:48,005 --> 01:55:50,005
You don't know her.
She is playing a game.

1943
01:55:50,505 --> 01:55:53,130
She accepted that herself,
on the day of your engagement...

1944
01:55:55,547 --> 01:55:57,547
And what do you think, whatever...

1945
01:56:08,755 --> 01:56:09,955
I am getting married tomorrow.

1946
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,130
You're invited for drinks

1947
01:57:08,255 --> 01:57:13,422
"if you stay upset...
then who would smile?"

1948
01:57:13,922 --> 01:57:19,047
"if you go...
then who would stay back?"

1949
01:57:19,755 --> 01:57:24,297
"When you stay quiet, I feel scared..."

1950
01:57:25,422 --> 01:57:30,380
"Who would claim me as his own, now?"

1951
01:57:42,505 --> 01:57:47,130
"if you stay upset...
then who would smile?"

1952
01:57:48,172 --> 01:57:52,922
"if you go...
then who would stay back?"

1953
01:57:54,005 --> 01:57:58,172
"When you stay quiet, I feel scared..."

1954
01:57:59,672 --> 01:58:04,922
"Who would claim me as his own, now?"

1955
01:58:05,297 --> 01:58:08,172
"You are the reason..."

1956
01:58:08,255 --> 01:58:16,255
"Without you,
I am useless, without a cause."

1957
01:58:17,547 --> 01:58:19,797
"I am your best friend."

1958
01:58:23,172 --> 01:58:26,505
"I am your best friend."

1959
01:59:27,505 --> 01:59:28,755
I feel so strange.

1960
01:59:30,422 --> 01:59:32,172
I know I'm getting married...

1961
01:59:33,172 --> 01:59:34,505
But today...

1962
01:59:36,547 --> 01:59:38,380
You know to think that
it's happening today...

1963
01:59:40,297 --> 01:59:42,255
I've just been smiling
since the time I woke up.

1964
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,047
You are happy, aren't you?

1965
01:59:47,005 --> 01:59:48,297
I am getting married today

1966
01:59:48,672 --> 01:59:50,297
I just want everyone to be happy.

1967
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:55,880
I was wondering what
to do with your room.

1968
01:59:57,380 --> 01:59:59,047
I mean I knew you'd be kicked out...

1969
02:00:00,255 --> 02:00:02,505
just didn't know
it would happen so soon.

1970
02:00:07,547 --> 02:00:08,922
We were in school.

1971
02:00:09,672 --> 02:00:13,005
There was a boy who
used to trouble Titu a lot.

1972
02:00:13,797 --> 02:00:16,380
Every day he'd sit behind
Titu and poke him with a pencil.

1973
02:00:17,172 --> 02:00:18,588
Titu would cry a lot.

1974
02:00:19,172 --> 02:00:21,297
One day I sat behind that boy.

1975
02:00:22,505 --> 02:00:25,797
And as he was about to sit,
I put a compass below him.

1976
02:00:26,297 --> 02:00:27,547
That boy cried a lot,

1977
02:00:27,922 --> 02:00:29,088
Complained to the teacher,

1978
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,380
I was severely beaten up.

1979
02:00:31,297 --> 02:00:35,255
But after that day,
no one in school dared to trouble Titu.

1980
02:00:38,755 --> 02:00:40,255
Titu tells you everything, right?

1981
02:00:41,130 --> 02:00:42,172
You know everything?

1982
02:00:44,672 --> 02:00:46,797
You know everything Titu tells you.

1983
02:00:47,630 --> 02:00:50,047
I know everything that
Titu doesn't even tell himself.

1984
02:00:53,297 --> 02:00:54,898
You haven't spent
as many months with him..

1985
02:00:54,922 --> 02:00:56,630
As I've spent years

1986
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:59,505
I've always kept him
safe from people like you.

1987
02:01:03,672 --> 02:01:04,880
My Titu is naive,

1988
02:01:05,547 --> 02:01:07,047
gets influenced quite easily,

1989
02:01:08,047 --> 02:01:09,797
then doesn't understand any reasoning.

1990
02:01:10,422 --> 02:01:12,797
That's why I have
to resort to such methods.

1991
02:01:15,422 --> 02:01:16,505
It is actually my fault.

1992
02:01:17,297 --> 02:01:18,797
I started trying to defeat you

1993
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:24,338
I'd forgotten that it was never about
defeating you, it was about saving Titu.

1994
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:32,255
And if it's about saving Titu,
then come what may.

1995
02:01:33,297 --> 02:01:35,005
You will not get married tonight.

1996
02:01:37,922 --> 02:01:40,463
I swear by my life.

1997
02:01:48,005 --> 02:01:49,005
You can try,

1998
02:01:51,505 --> 02:01:52,797
But let me warn you,

1999
02:01:54,172 --> 02:01:55,380
Between a friend and a girl,

2000
02:01:55,422 --> 02:01:56,755
The girl always wins.

2001
02:02:21,755 --> 02:02:22,755
What's your plan now?

2002
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:26,505
No more plans, Ghasitey.

2003
02:02:28,922 --> 02:02:31,547
Wait, let me sort this nonsense.

2004
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,880
No, Ghasitey.

2005
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:38,547
If you have to sort,
then there's nothing left to sort.

2006
02:02:41,047 --> 02:02:42,297
She warned me...

2007
02:02:44,130 --> 02:02:45,356
That between a friend and a girl,

2008
02:02:45,380 --> 02:02:46,547
The girl always wins.

2009
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:50,020
So now either the
friend will make me win.

2010
02:02:51,047 --> 02:02:52,047
Or else...

2011
02:02:54,422 --> 02:02:57,630
Like others, even Sonu and Titu
will meet once in three months...

2012
02:03:00,672 --> 02:03:02,422
Call each other on birthdays...

2013
02:03:05,297 --> 02:03:08,005
Get drunk and tell tales
of their friendship...

2014
02:03:16,547 --> 02:03:19,255
"It's my best friend's wedding today."

2015
02:03:19,297 --> 02:03:21,922
"It's my best friend's wedding today."

2016
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:24,922
"It's my best friend's wedding..."

2017
02:03:31,005 --> 02:03:35,255
"Come, let's fight over toys again."

2018
02:03:36,047 --> 02:03:41,463
"You can win, I will lose."

2019
02:03:42,297 --> 02:03:47,172
"Come, let's be mischievous again."

2020
02:03:47,422 --> 02:03:52,880
"You can run away,
I will stay to get beaten up."

2021
02:03:54,422 --> 02:03:59,505
"Even your abuses sound sweet."

2022
02:04:00,005 --> 02:04:05,797
"I am all ears for them."

2023
02:04:06,422 --> 02:04:09,297
"I am your best friend."

2024
02:04:12,047 --> 02:04:15,505
"I am your best friend."

2025
02:04:17,797 --> 02:04:20,963
"I am your best friend..."

2026
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:33,755
"It is the time to celebrate."

2027
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,672
"It is an auspicious occasion..."

2028
02:04:36,755 --> 02:04:39,421
"Music will play,
buddies will dance..."

2029
02:04:39,422 --> 02:04:42,297
"It's time to congratulate."

2030
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,922
"I am dancing with joy."

2031
02:04:48,547 --> 02:04:53,380
"I keep my tears at bay."

2032
02:04:59,297 --> 02:05:03,755
"Old relations don't fade away..."

2033
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:10,797
"When new relations are formed."

2034
02:05:11,005 --> 02:05:15,547
"If I am leaving, then let me go."

2035
02:05:16,047 --> 02:05:21,255
"Why are you upset that I am leaving?"

2036
02:05:21,755 --> 02:05:24,505
"Why fix what's broken?"

2037
02:05:24,547 --> 02:05:27,380
"Why did you turn towards me?"

2038
02:05:27,422 --> 02:05:29,921
"You have no right to say..."

2039
02:05:29,922 --> 02:05:33,380
"That we are no longer friends."

2040
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:39,172
"It's only of your friendship..."

2041
02:05:39,922 --> 02:05:46,005
"That I have a right over, forever."

2042
02:05:46,047 --> 02:05:49,422
"I am your best friend."

2043
02:06:08,922 --> 02:06:12,297
"I am your best friend."

2044
02:06:14,922 --> 02:06:19,130
"I am your best friend."

2045
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:24,088
"I am your best friend."

2046
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:29,547
"I am your best friend."

2047
02:06:49,797 --> 02:06:52,963
To heck with her truth
and to heck with my lies.

2048
02:07:01,130 --> 02:07:02,922
It's as simple as this Titu.

2049
02:07:04,672 --> 02:07:07,880
It's either her, or me.

2050
02:08:30,255 --> 02:08:31,797
You have two options.

2051
02:08:33,547 --> 02:08:35,797
Either believe that
I am telling the truth...

2052
02:08:36,922 --> 02:08:39,322
And then keep thinking all
your life that maybe he was right.

2053
02:08:40,922 --> 02:08:42,713
Or believe that he
is telling the truth...

2054
02:08:44,797 --> 02:08:47,047
And then keep thinking
all your life that I was right.

2055
02:08:55,297 --> 02:08:57,547
We were 13 when auntie passed away,

2056
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:04,255
I didn't move from Sonu's side
for three days, as he hadn't cried...

2057
02:09:07,297 --> 02:09:10,005
I couldn't not be with him when he did.

2058
02:09:14,255 --> 02:09:16,047
The fourth day he cried, in my arms.

2059
02:09:17,047 --> 02:09:18,047
Kept on crying.

2060
02:09:18,172 --> 02:09:19,630
For three hours straight.

2061
02:09:21,630 --> 02:09:24,172
I locked the door so
no one else could come in.

2062
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:29,922
Then he cried himself to sleep.

2063
02:09:35,047 --> 02:09:40,380
Since that day, I've never
seen a tear in his eyes, come what may.

2064
02:09:43,922 --> 02:09:47,297
You may be true, and he may be lying.

2065
02:09:51,672 --> 02:09:57,213
But if it is between you and him

2066
02:11:16,630 --> 02:11:18,172
I'll break your teeth.

2067
02:11:24,505 --> 02:11:26,297
We'll die single this way.

2068
02:11:26,505 --> 02:11:27,547
What do you mean by "we"?

2069
02:11:27,755 --> 02:11:29,297
Why would I die single?

2070
02:11:29,547 --> 02:11:31,922
It's not me who always
falls for the wrong girl.

2071
02:11:32,297 --> 02:11:34,130
When did you realize that she is wrong?

2072
02:11:34,422 --> 02:11:36,547
She told me on the
day of your engagement.

2073
02:11:36,672 --> 02:11:38,023
Then you should have
told me that day itself.

2074
02:11:38,047 --> 02:11:39,273
Would've saved us a
few lakhs and a some respect.

2075
02:11:39,297 --> 02:11:42,880
After twelve years,
I had made sweets with my own hands.

2076
02:11:44,130 --> 02:11:46,005
I almost booked a Jaguar.

2077
02:11:47,255 --> 02:11:48,630
You don't say a word, Ghasitey

2078
02:11:48,922 --> 02:11:50,047
I fought all by myself.

2079
02:11:50,505 --> 02:11:51,505
You were enjoying this.

2080
02:11:53,297 --> 02:11:55,380
This is my principle of life.

2081
02:11:56,130 --> 02:11:59,547
Never tell an idiot that he's an idiot.

2082
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:09,710
What's happening out there?

2083
02:12:10,755 --> 02:12:14,172
Lalu had given me two new notes of 500

2084
02:12:14,255 --> 02:12:17,023
I had fixed it for 22nd December
and he got it changed to 22nd October.

2085
02:12:17,047 --> 02:12:19,797
If you marry on them on a
wrong date then its bound to happen.

2086
02:12:20,422 --> 02:12:21,422
Here's the catering bill.

2087
02:12:22,172 --> 02:12:23,172
The light bill.

2088
02:12:23,797 --> 02:12:24,797
Decoration bill.

2089
02:12:25,547 --> 02:12:26,880
And this is the location bill.

2090
02:12:27,297 --> 02:12:28,356
And here's another
rough estimated bill.

2091
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:30,672
Okay, but wasn't
splitting part of the deal.

2092
02:12:30,797 --> 02:12:32,130
Well so was a marriage,

2093
02:12:32,172 --> 02:12:33,130
Where's the groom?

2094
02:12:33,172 --> 02:12:34,672
You are being disgustingly rude.

2095
02:12:34,797 --> 02:12:35,797
I am being rude?

2096
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:37,172
I am disgusting?

2097
02:12:37,255 --> 02:12:38,773
You disgusting, your father disgusting.

2098
02:12:38,797 --> 02:12:39,755
Your entire family is disgusting.

2099
02:12:39,797 --> 02:12:40,672
Even your sweets are disgusting!

2100
02:12:40,797 --> 02:12:42,380
Don't say a word against my sweets!

2101
02:12:42,422 --> 02:12:44,005
But please, try to understand.

2102
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:45,523
- I...
- Don't try to make me understand.

2103
02:12:45,547 --> 02:12:47,023
Make your characterless son understand!

2104
02:12:47,047 --> 02:12:48,963
Hey!! How dare you
call my son characterless?

2105
02:12:49,047 --> 02:12:50,773
You characterless,
your daughter characterless!

2106
02:12:50,797 --> 02:12:53,023
I can see who is characterless!
Look at the way you talk.

2107
02:12:53,047 --> 02:12:54,797
Give the necklace back!

2108
02:12:55,130 --> 02:12:57,130
Did you leave alone or
did everyone leave with you?

2109
02:12:57,297 --> 02:12:58,963
I don't know who left behind me.

2110
02:12:59,255 --> 02:13:00,922
How could I turn back to see?

2111
02:13:01,547 --> 02:13:02,672
Would've ruined the impact.

2112
02:13:06,672 --> 02:13:09,255
I swear on God,
God has stopped making good girls.

2113
02:13:09,963 --> 02:13:11,547
Don't worry. I am there for you.

2114
02:13:12,172 --> 02:13:13,172
What do you mean?

2115
02:13:13,547 --> 02:13:15,630
Think I'm crazy to
ruin my life with you?

2116
02:13:16,922 --> 02:13:19,005
I think I've had
enough of this nonsense

2117
02:13:19,255 --> 02:13:20,421
I am 28,

2118
02:13:20,422 --> 02:13:23,130
I should find a nice girl
and settle down before I turn 30.

2119
02:13:23,922 --> 02:13:27,922
Sonu, my darling,
I know that you too have some needs.

2120
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:30,922
I am not getting married for sex.

2121
02:13:31,005 --> 02:13:32,023
Why're you thinking of marrying at all?

2122
02:13:32,047 --> 02:13:33,172
He's an idiot.

2123
02:13:43,047 --> 02:13:44,755
Idiot, at least tell me that...

2124
02:13:45,672 --> 02:13:47,213
I like sofas.

2125
02:13:47,797 --> 02:13:49,713
I am telling you Ghasita...

2126
02:13:50,922 --> 02:13:52,297
What a...

2127
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:54,922
Not at all, auntie... ah mummy.

2128
02:13:55,047 --> 02:13:57,130
Send all the bed sheets...
to the laundry.

2129
02:13:57,172 --> 02:13:59,755
Call the plumber in the afternoon
and get the inside bathroom...

2130
02:14:02,922 --> 02:14:04,880
I am telling... you are protective...

2131
02:14:05,005 --> 02:14:05,922
One second, sir. One second.

2132
02:14:05,923 --> 02:14:07,255
Sir, dropped the Kurta.

2133
02:14:07,505 --> 02:14:09,023
One second, sir.
The mike has dropped again.

2134
02:14:09,047 --> 02:14:10,422
Malkit Singh is...

2135
02:14:11,672 --> 02:14:12,880
Damn it...

2136
02:14:12,922 --> 02:14:15,380
Your Mother-in-law health...
is not good.

2137
02:14:15,422 --> 02:14:15,880
I am sorry.

2138
02:14:16,005 --> 02:14:17,765
- Just dance, grandma?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2139
02:14:17,797 --> 02:14:18,630
One more.

2140
02:14:18,672 --> 02:14:20,505
Tell me something... come again.

2141
02:14:24,172 --> 02:14:25,172
"Get me..."

2142
02:14:25,297 --> 02:14:26,297
"Get me..."

2143
02:14:26,505 --> 02:14:27,547
"Get me..."

2144
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:29,630
"Serve me the drink I'm crazy about,
get me tipsy."

2145
02:14:29,672 --> 02:14:32,213
"I'm a bad girl, I like whiskey."

2146
02:14:32,255 --> 02:14:34,148
"Serve me the drink I'm crazy about,
get me tipsy."

2147
02:14:34,172 --> 02:14:36,755
"I'm a bad girl, I like whiskey."

2148
02:14:36,797 --> 02:14:41,296
"When I get tipsy,
I tend to get risky."

2149
02:14:41,297 --> 02:14:43,273
"Serve me the drink I'm crazy about,
get me tipsy."

2150
02:14:43,297 --> 02:14:45,796
"I'm a bad girl, I like whiskey."

2151
02:14:45,797 --> 02:14:48,255
"Come on girl, get ready."

2152
02:14:48,297 --> 02:14:50,505
"Country liquor served
in an English bar."

2153
02:14:50,630 --> 02:14:52,797
"Come on girl, get ready."

2154
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:55,046
"Country liquor served
in an English bar."

2155
02:14:55,047 --> 02:14:57,380
"Let's swig small shots, baby..."

2156
02:14:57,505 --> 02:14:59,672
"Let's swig small shots."

2157
02:14:59,755 --> 02:15:01,922
"Let's swig small shots, baby..."

2158
02:15:02,005 --> 02:15:03,047
"Let's swig..."

2159
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:04,130
"Put your hands up!"

2160
02:15:07,755 --> 02:15:08,880
"Put your hands up!"

2161
02:15:12,297 --> 02:15:13,338
"Put your hands up!"

2162
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:15,630
"You downed a bottle in no time."

2163
02:15:15,672 --> 02:15:17,880
"Your scene is beyond
any reasoning of mine."

2164
02:15:18,005 --> 02:15:20,005
"I know that you'll
get a hangover, baby."

2165
02:15:20,047 --> 02:15:22,297
"That's why I carry
lemons in pockets already."

2166
02:15:22,547 --> 02:15:24,797
"In a single shot, I wooed you."

2167
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:26,880
"I took the risk of chasing you."

2168
02:15:26,922 --> 02:15:29,088
"It's bitter but it's true..."

2169
02:15:29,130 --> 02:15:31,547
"You should home be
playing with a Barbie doll."

2170
02:15:31,672 --> 02:15:33,880
"This song has become A-rated now."

2171
02:15:33,922 --> 02:15:36,047
"Bottles downed by you, half a dozen."

2172
02:15:36,130 --> 02:15:38,422
"What's the use of
living a sober life?"

2173
02:15:38,547 --> 02:15:40,921
"One should learn
how to drink from you."

2174
02:15:40,922 --> 02:15:45,297
"There is only one way
in which can reach paradise."

2175
02:15:45,422 --> 02:15:49,922
"Drink all you want because
it's five bucks cheaper."

2176
02:15:59,130 --> 02:16:01,130
"Serve me the drink I'm crazy about,
get me tipsy."

2177
02:16:01,172 --> 02:16:03,630
"I'm a bad girl, I like whiskey."

2178
02:16:03,672 --> 02:16:08,088
"When I get tipsy,
I tend to get risky."

2179
02:16:08,255 --> 02:16:10,296
"Serve me the drink I'm crazy about,
get me tipsy."

2180
02:16:10,297 --> 02:16:12,797
"I'm a bad girl, I like whiskey."

2181
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:17,255
"You are shinning more
than anyone in this party."

2182
02:16:17,380 --> 02:16:21,797
"I am drowning in your eyes
as you are drowning in Bacardi."

2183
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:23,755
"It's not a night to
get drunk on your own."

2184
02:16:23,797 --> 02:16:26,380
"I noticed you are all alone."

2185
02:16:26,505 --> 02:16:31,005
"There are many girls
here but no one is like you."

2186
02:16:31,047 --> 02:16:35,213
"Sitting here all this while,
I have been reading your mind."

2187
02:16:35,422 --> 02:16:37,671
"What you need is country liquor..."

2188
02:16:37,672 --> 02:16:39,880
"That's why I am been
trying to convince you."

2189
02:16:39,922 --> 02:16:40,422
"What?"

2190
02:16:40,423 --> 02:16:41,922
"Come On..."

2191
02:16:42,297 --> 02:16:44,880
"Come on girl, get ready."

2192
02:16:44,922 --> 02:16:47,005
"Country liquor served
in an English bar."

2193
02:16:47,047 --> 02:16:49,380
"Come on girl, get ready."

2194
02:16:49,422 --> 02:16:51,588
"Country liquor served
in an English bar."

2195
02:16:51,630 --> 02:16:53,880
"Let's swig small shots, baby..."

2196
02:16:53,922 --> 02:16:56,088
"Let's swig small shots."

2197
02:16:56,172 --> 02:16:58,380
"Let's swig small shots, baby..."

2198
02:16:58,547 --> 02:16:59,547
"Let's swig..."

2199
02:16:59,922 --> 02:17:01,213
"Yo yo Honey Singh!"

2200
02:17:04,297 --> 02:17:05,422
"Put your hands up!"

2201
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:10,130
"Put your hands up!"
