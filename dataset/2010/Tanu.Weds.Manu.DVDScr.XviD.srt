01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:04,451
then why did you lie?

459
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:16,393

by the age of 12

460
01:31:17,338 --> 01:31:22,799
daily l make breakfast and l eat alone
and l alone go to office

461
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,173
l dont have any good friend

462
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:31,414
l lived very unromantic life

463
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:37,857
then parentes forced me to do marriage

464
01:31:43,531 --> 01:31:45,021
l come here and l fell in love with you

465
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:52,470
is it my mistake?

01:31:55,243 --> 01:32:03,014
you told me that l dont want to marry then
l go back. now you come back again

467
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,813
l did not had power in court

468
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:12,955
l was thinking if you will not get a pen
than you will not get married

469
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:43,441
can you see any difference between
me and you?

470
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:48,682
l also cannot see any difference between
me and her

471
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:55,727
after meeting you l made a tattoo

472
01:33:56,397 --> 01:34:00,424
you know l made a mistake

473
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:06,506
after meeting Manu l felt he

474
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:13,570
he never customize me.
he allows me the way l'm

476
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:23,218
you will always made a mistake.

477
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:33,426
sometimes you made mistake and
sometimes l made

01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:24,435
l was saying l could not stop

483
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:01,010
