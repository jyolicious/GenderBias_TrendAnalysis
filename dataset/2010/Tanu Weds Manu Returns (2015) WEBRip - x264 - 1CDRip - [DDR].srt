[DDR]

2
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:57,208
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

3
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:04,083
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

4
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:10,208
"I've chosen you... you choose me too."

5
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:14,208
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

6
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:49,625
"No girl ever takes the first step."

7
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:55,458
"She never utters a word unless her heart's helpless."

8
00:02:55,958 --> 00:03:02,625
"She never utters a word unless her heart's helpless."

9
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,916
"My heart's crossed all limits of happiness."

10
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:12,458
"I wish to spend rest of my life with you."

11
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:19,083
"Come weave these dreams of love with me."

12
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:25,833
"O beloved..." "Listen to the tune of love."

13
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:32,166
"I've chosen you... you choose me too."

14
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,166
"O beloved..."

15
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,291
Come inside, please.

16
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:09,000
When did you two get married?

17
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,458
Marriage?

18
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:11,833
Well...it was winter.

19
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,458
People were wearing warm clothes.

20
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,250
Why don't you tell them if you know?

21
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,833
25th October, doctor.

22
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,458
25th October!

23
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:23,625
How long have you two been married?

24
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,791
4 years! - 4 years!

25
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:25,916
4 years!

26
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,583
When did the problem begin?

27
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,666
I mean...tell me from the beginning.

28
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,916
Doctor, this is happened 4 years ago.

29
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,375
I was a small kid. - Kid? Her?

30
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,833
Can I talk?

31
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,583
I was very young.

32
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,250
I loved a boy called Raja Awasthi.

33
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,333
This man tricked me into marrying him..

34
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:47,416
What?

35
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,083
Can I talk?

36
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,208
Can I share my view..

37
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,250
You talk, Doctor, I am going to sit there.

38
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,000
Let me know.

39
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,583
See...what did I say?

40
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,125
This is what happens.

41
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,083
It's okay. - Dr. Goswami, I am a doctor too..

42
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:03,125
..and in my professional opinion..

43
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,250
..my wife is suffering from a bipolar disorder.

44
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,666
She has anxiety issues, acute hysteria.

45
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:09,458
Thyroid problems.

46
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,583
We got all the tests done for thyroid..

47
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:15,041
..the results were negative. You..

48
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:19,750
Go ahead and lie...go on.

49
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,958
Hormonal issues.

50
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,458
You know, some days she's absolutely fine.

51
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,333
And then suddenly she's grieving.

52
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,208
Some days she gets furious over trivial matters..

53
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,666
..and suddenly she's fine again.

54
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,833
You know, if she starts quarrelling, she can't stop.

55
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,791
And if she's fine... she's fine.

56
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,333
See the pattern, it's like a.. - Mr. Sharma.

57
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,041
According to this, all the women in the world are bipolar.

58
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,000
And I think, according to your description..

59
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,166
..she seems absolutely fine.

60
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,000
Mrs. Sharma, you tell us.

61
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,583
Doctor, I'll tell you from the beginning.

62
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,333
My name is Tanuja Trivedi.

63
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,500
I am a resident of Kanpur, Virana Road.

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,458
I loved a boy.

65
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,208
But this man fell in love with me.

66
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,250
He tricked me into marrying him..

67
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,583
..and brought me to London.

68
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,041
I thought he's a successful doctor..

69
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,458
..but, he barely makes ends meet.

70
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,208
Earlier, we lived at South Hall.

71
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,416
Where people hang their underwear outside their home.

72
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:12,000
He finally changed home after I kept insisting.

73
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,083
We lived outside London, in the country.

74
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,000
Except for 5 pigeons..

75
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,625
..and 3 raccoons, I don't see a single soul out there.

76
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,250
Calm down, dear. Please take this.

77
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,958
So...was he always like this?

78
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:26,708
He wasn't always like this.

79
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,625
The first year was nice.

80
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,625
There was love, excitement, sex..

81
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,125
We would go out, have candle-night dinner.

82
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,750
Drink beer in the pub.

83
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,666
But slowly he started showing his true colors.

84
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,333
Everything just went 'poof'.

85
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,541
Went where?

86
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,208
What? - I mean...it disappeared.

87
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,041
Vanished. - Vanished.

88
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,041
What should I do for excitement?

89
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,208
I can dance.. - You think you can dance, Manu Sharma.

90
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,458
Have you seen your condition?

91
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,000
There's no meat left on your bones.

92
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,625
This man's growing like a ginger.

93
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:56,750
Sprouting from all directions.

94
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,625
I wasn't exactly Hrithik Roshan before we got married.

95
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,875
I was always like this. - You were like this.

96
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,500
No personality or sense of humor.

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,333
So...you could've married Raju Srivastav.

98
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,916
Look, I can give her a stable life..

99
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,083
..I can't crack jokes.

100
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:11,916
He can never crack jokes, he's the ultimate boring man.

101
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,041
Ask him about his weekend plans, and he'll say..

102
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,583
..there's a 25% discount at Tesco..

103
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:16,750
..let's go shopping.

104
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,625
Let's go for a stroll around the lake. If I ask him for a party..

105
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,458
..then he calls four of his friends from IIT along with their wife.

106
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,708
There's not much difference between them..

107
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,083
..and my aunty from Rampur.

108
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,750
I had such a happening life in India..

109
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,708
..but he's completely messed up my life.

110
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:29,666
What?

111
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,583
Messed up - What?

112
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:38,458
It means...destroyed. - Destroyed.

113
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,208
Destroyed.

114
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,541
I never...even made a cup of tea for my father.

115
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,458
But I washed this man's clothes.

116
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,458
Cooked for him. He said, start a children's crche..

117
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,750
..to keep yourself busy.

118
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,875
I did that too. But he still doesn't respect me.

119
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,000
I thought he'll change.

120
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,250
It'll juice up our life.

121
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,958
A girl has so many dreams

122
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,458
when she agrees for a love-marriage.

123
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,125
But I think I love him, but I stopped liking him.

124
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,708
I think I love him like a mammal.

125
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:11,833
Like a Homo-sapien.

126
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,000
Stop this.

127
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,708
It's all a lie, absurd.

128
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,000
It was never a love-marriage.

129
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,125
We had an arranged marriage.

130
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,583
And why did you think I will change?

131
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,666
Did we meet on some bridge, with my arms open wide?

132
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,083
I was formally dressed, when I came to see her..

133
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,791
..along with my parents. - That was a nice pair of clothes.

134
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,833
So, I did come to your house. - Please let him speak.

135
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,083
We got married with the consent of her parents.

136
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,083
And I am no fruit to juice-up again.

137
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,583
Dr. Moris, how many different ways can one say "I Love You".

138
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:36,708
No spark! No spark!

139
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,583
I am a man, not a lighter.

140
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,416
And let me tell you about her spark.

141
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,416
She hit my friend Mathur's wife on the head with a coke bottle.

142
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,833
People stopped visiting us.

143
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,958
And the Crche... Ask her how did that shut down?

144
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,625
She gave alcohol to the children to shut them up.

145
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,166
There was a police case. I was nearly arrested.

146
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,625
And this woman flirts around in the pub...with foreigners.

147
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,750
Right in front of me! - Who else should I do it with? You?

148
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,083
I tried that once. But you're just a dead body.

149
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,166
Why shouldn't I flirt around?

150
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,000
There's a 5000 year old history of atrocities against woman.

151
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,250
Have I been committing atrocities against women for 5000 years!

152
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,416
Will you take revenge only on me?

153
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,250
Men are doing it. All men are alike.

154
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,583
As long as you get sex.. - What sex?

155
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,833
It happened back in 2013.

156
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,708
He remembers that. He remembers that. - Yes.

157
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,625
That was the only thing worth remembering. - Calm...

158
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,958
Calm down. - Please!

159
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,833
Please calm down!

160
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,333
Sorry.

161
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:30,000
Doctor, I think he's a pervert.

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,958
The way he stares at girls..

163
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,958
What do you mean? - It's like he'll devour them.

164
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:35,000
He's a lecher.

165
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,416
I.. I never even gave that look to my wife.

166
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,541
Why would I look at other girls like that?

167
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,125
When he came to Kanpur, to see me..

168
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,625
..he kissed me when I was asleep.

169
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,833
Without my consent. Without my awareness.

170
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,875
Ask him...ask him.

171
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,041
I was descent enough to tell you that.

172
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,833
You didn't know.. - You were drunk like a log. - No.

173
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,791
You were drunk.. - Calm down.

174
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:53,625
Calm down.

175
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,666
Calm down. Calm down. Please calm down.

176
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,750
Did you kiss me or not? - Yes, I did! I did!

177
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,583
I made a big mistake. - Calm down!

178
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:00,583
Calm down please.

179
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:01,833
I won't spare you!

180
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,250
I won't spare you!

181
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,625
Crazy girl... witch.

182
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,291
Relax. - Catch her!

183
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,041
You're making a big mistake, Dr. Goswami by letting this woman out.

184
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,625
She has ruined my life.

185
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,333
Now she'll ruin other lives too. This is illegal. Leave me.

186
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,666
Tanu, stop them.

187
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,666
Leave me.

188
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,541
Hello. - Tanu! Good news!

189
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,291
You've become an aunty.

190
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,458
Boy or girl?

191
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,833
Girl... Little girl.

192
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,083
And the father's right here. He's stuffing his face.

193
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,208
Hello, feed me too, I gave birth to her.

194
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:46,333
Where are you? How's your husband?

195
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,291
Where's Mr. Sharma?

196
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,625
He's in the mental asylum. - What?

197
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,583
If he behaves madly in front of a psychiatrist..

198
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,833
..then they're bound to think he's crazy.

199
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,291
They kept him there.

200
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,291
What are you saying? I don't understand.

201
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,541
Where are you now?

202
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,458
I am in London. - I know you're in London.

203
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,708
But are you okay.

204
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,041
I don't know.

205
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,041
I am thinking about going back to Kanpur.

206
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,458
Place the mask over your nose and mouth..

207
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,458
..and tighten by pulling the straps.

208
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,375
Here...go.

209
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,375
Poor.

210
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,375
Yes, come on.

211
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,166
Be careful, the children might spill it.

212
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:46,750
We'll distribute it to everyone out here.

213
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,208
Come.

214
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,166
Hello. - Where's the pickle?

215
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,333
Who is it?

216
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,416
Tanu speaking.

217
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,250
Sister-in-law!

218
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,625
Hello.

219
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,458
You forgot all about us after shifting to London.

220
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,458
Hold on, sister-in-law.

221
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,875
The network's really bad in here.

222
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,583
You know, it's an auspicious day today.

223
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,875
And look who called.

224
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:07,958
Pappi. - Yes.

225
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,208
Manu is in the mental asylum.

226
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,000
So please get him out.

227
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,458
No, no.. - What happened?

228
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,416
Nothing.

229
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,958
St. Benedict Mental Asylum..

230
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,875
..for Mental Illness, in Trikanham.

231
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,791
What? What was that?

232
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:22,958
Come again.

233
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,666
I'll text you the details.

234
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:25,916
But please hurry up.

235
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,833
It's been 2-3 days and he doesn't have his phone or credit card.

236
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,083
Oh, God!

237
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,166
The only son of Sharma Family is in a mental asylum.

238
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,166
Please get him out as soon as you can.

239
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,416
Was it your sister-in-law? - Yes.

240
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,500
What's wrong with you?

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,041
Speak up.

242
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,083
Manu... - Manu what?

243
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,875
Manu what?

244
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,458
He's in the mental asylum.

245
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,166
Passengers, your attention please.

246
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,750
The train arriving from Delhi..

247
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,958
Train no. 12717..

248
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:07,875
... is arrived at plate farm no 5.

249
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,333
Did you get married, Deepak? - Yes.

250
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,250
I even have a 5 year old daughter.

251
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,625
I couldn't decide on any one for a long time.

252
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,375
But then father passed away.

253
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,041
And my elder brother refused to support me.

254
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,250
I left collage because of money.

255
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,416
I needed someone to look after the family.

256
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,083
Do you miss me?

257
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:25,875
Yes.

258
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,791
Not often, only sometimes.

259
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,125
When?

260
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:34,125
When?

261
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,208
Tanu aunty is back!

262
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,250
Tanu aunty is back!

263
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,875
Mom, dad...

264
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,208
Sister-in-law, Tanu is back.

265
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,958
Aunty is back.

266
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,291
Tanu aunty is back!

267
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,833
Tanu aunty is back!

268
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:57,875
Sister, I'll go get the veneration platter. - Hurry up.

269
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,958
This is for your girl. - Don't embarrass me.

270
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,958
Keep it. - You think I'll charge you money.

271
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,833
I have such sweet memories about you.

272
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,625
Time and age ruined everything.

273
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:17,125
Yes, I'll you, let's go in..

274
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,583
Let's go inside.

275
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,416
It was nice meeting you, Deepak.

276
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,541
Bye.

277
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:22,583
See you.

278
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,541
Uncle. - Bless you, dear. how are you?

279
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,208
Hello, uncle. - Fine.

280
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,083
Papa. - I'm going to buy vegetables from the market.

281
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,208
Who was that, dear? - He was a friend.

282
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,208
Friend? She has a rickshaw driver friend.

283
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,166
How are you, dear?

284
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,041
That rickshaw-puller is your friend.

285
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,625
How can she have a rickshaw puller as a friend?

286
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:40,583
Be quiet.

287
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,000
Dear, how did you come so suddenly?

288
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,250
Is everything okay? - Yes, everything alright.

289
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,750
How is Manu?

290
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,375
He's in the mental asylum.

291
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,500
What?

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,250
But.. - We learnt a wonderful dance just for you.

293
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,958
It's better than Katrina.

294
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,083
Later.

295
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,208
Who's that guy?

296
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,583
Chintu, from Rampur.

297
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,000
What's he doing?

298
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,125
After you got married..

299
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,583
..brother rented out your room to him.

300
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,208
He's been living here for the past 6 months..

301
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,958
..without paying a single penny.

302
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,458
He's studying law at the university.

303
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:16,375
Every time we ask him to vacate..

304
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,791
..he threatens us with the law.

305
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,375
I suggested that we shut him out.

306
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,458
But that rascal, uses a ladder to climb up.

307
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:26,833
He's a scoundrel.

308
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,458
But you don't get into all this, dear.

309
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,791
Freshen up and let's have some tea.

310
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,958
Son...

311
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,291
3 days.

312
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,083
I want you to vacate the room in 3 days.

313
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:41,833
Otherwise...or I'll pass judgment on you on Virana Road.

314
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,500
If Lucknow is romantic, Kanpur is industrial

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,750
Listen carefully.

316
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,208
Don't forget to applaud.

317
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,333
If Lucknow is romantic, Kanpur is industrial

318
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,083
Bareli is naughty

319
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,166
Then Rampur is witty!

320
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,458
I won't leave easily.

321
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,666
You're free to give your judgment.

322
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,458
He's a big scoundrel.

323
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,125
You don't get into this.

324
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,916
Neetu...check the lentil.

325
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:13,416
Sister-in-law, you picked out all the cottage cheese.

326
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,458
There's no cottage-cheese left in this dish.

327
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,041
They finished off the cottage-cheese.

328
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,625
Don't force me to tell them about you.

329
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,208
Be quiet.

330
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,541
Sister-in-law, make some tea for me.

331
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,166
Then go sleep.

332
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,291
You're neither watching the video nor letting me watch it.

333
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:34,291
You're only making this worse.

334
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,083
Yeah. Yeah. - Look at that. Have you been there?

335
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,083
Hold on. - Look at that.

336
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,916
Wait.

337
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,375
Hello. - Pappi. Have you reached London?

338
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,958
Did you get brother out of the mental asylum?

339
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,458
Sister-in-law, the ticket cost 60,000 rupees..

340
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,708
..so it didn't feel right to head to the mental asylum directly.

341
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,666
So I thought... I am on the Thames right now.

342
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:54,875
Are you crazy?

343
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,833
Do you know what a mental asylum is?

344
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,625
Be quiet.

345
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,291
Do you know what it means?

346
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,208
Yes, sister-in-law. - So get him out.

347
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:08,250
And text me as soon as you do. - Yes.

348
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,791
Look at that.

349
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,625
I heard a lot about you, until now.

350
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,000
We never got a chance to meet.

351
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,083
You know, Tanu you're the Batman of this neighborhood.

352
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,958
We only hear stories about you.

353
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,291
I heard there were two grooms in your marriage.

354
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,250
Shots were fired too.

355
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,291
Such sad eyes.

356
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,958
Where did you get those?

357
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,583
How about some tea, sister?

358
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,041
Are you just being formal, or do you respect me as one.

359
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,833
I also have a bottle.

360
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,000
Sign here? - Yes, sir.

361
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,291
You can take him now, sir.

362
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:50,291
Thank you. - Welcome.

363
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:06,875
The beard suits you.

364
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,541
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

365
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,375
Didn't you get the ones with the stripes?

366
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,416
His humor is running.

367
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,083
Are you okay?

368
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,333
Brother, I am in love.

369
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,208
Thank you. Thank you.

370
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,416
Remember that girl in Jassi's marriage. Komal.

371
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:28,166
She's given the nod.

372
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,375
Look...two crazy guys are playing chess.

373
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,166
Now you have to help me get married.

374
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,875
After all, I am 34 years old.

375
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,833
I have needs too. Try to understand.

376
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,500
This is what makes a man turn criminal. Understand.

377
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,250
Taxi! - Stop. Stop.

378
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,291
Astrid Kemp, please.

379
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,916
I told Komal's family..

380
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,791
..that I am very close to the Sharma family.

381
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,916
And uncle's booked a shop for me in Greater Noida.

382
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,250
And he'll leave 1 million for me.

383
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh my...what a beautiful house.

384
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,291
Is it rented?

385
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,375
I think I'll have to elope with Komal.

386
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,833
What do you say?

387
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,958
If her family doesn't agree..

388
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,791
..then that's my last resort.

389
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,750
Hear my plan. The plan is like this..

390
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,541
The plane will land in Delhi, okay.

391
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,708
And from Delhi we'll head straight to Punjab..

392
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,541
Speak softly. - Okay.

393
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,291
From Delhi, we'll take a bus..

394
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,125
..and head straight to Punjab. Okay.

395
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,000
Now your job is to talk to Komal's parents in Punjabi.

396
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,458
How? Well...like you do normally? Hi...hello.

397
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,416
This way they will feel comfortable.

398
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,000
All well if they say yes..

399
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,166
..if not, I'll elope with the girl.

400
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,958
And then...

401
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,958
Shut up!

402
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,750
Are you crazy?

403
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,208
Do you see my condition!

404
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,958
This is what happens to a man post-marriage.

405
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,458
I was in a mental asylum for 5 days.

406
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,125
Do you want to go there too? Do you?

407
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:51,125
Crazy fool wants to get married.

408
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,333
Tanu. How much longer will you take?

409
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,083
Hurry up, dear.

410
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,625
The boy and his family will be here soon.

411
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,958
Tanu. The boy and his family will be here soon.

412
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,500
You should see him too. How is Ankita looking?

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Neetu, have the sweetmeats arrived.

414
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,875
So you're out, beloved.

415
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,208
Give the kids some space to walk, he might drop the glasses.

416
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,791
Try these.

417
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,166
He's such a rascal. Whenever we have guest, he's washing his clothes.

418
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,958
Do you have to do that now? - I have to.

419
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,000
Mister, these days hair threading is available in Kanpur too.

420
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,000
You have a big patch.

421
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,125
There's a clinic next to the lake.

422
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,875
They charge 10,000 and guarantee long hair.

423
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,000
May be.

424
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,000
Tanu?

425
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:07,041
Hello.

426
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,166
She's our daughter. Tanu.

427
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,000
She recently returned from London.

428
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,291
London - Yes, London.

429
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,291
You see, out there everything is open.

430
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:29,833
Open...you see.

431
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,000
So who is the boy here?

432
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,958
Who is the boy!

433
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,458
What do you do for a living?

434
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,291
What do you do for a living?

435
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,375
I.. - I!

436
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,875
I.. - I!

437
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,875
I work for a IT Firm in Hyderabad.

438
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:56,625
IT...

439
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,291
Bloody they all work for an IT firm, huh!

440
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,916
They all work in a computer shop.

441
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,416
Why do you want to get married?

442
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,125
Why do you want to get married?

443
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,708
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

444
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,000
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

445
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,833
Have you ever been to a club?

446
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,458
Have you ever been to a club?

447
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,041
Ankita, my dear little Susie.

448
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,500
It's nothing.

449
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,916
Your life has become boring.

450
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,791
And for that you don't need to..

451
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:32,375
..get this 70 kilos of burden on top of you.

452
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:37,208
You just need to break the monotony.

453
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,958
Do something exciting.

454
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:39,916
Anything.

455
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,375
Run away from home with someone.

456
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:43,916
If you can't find someone, then run away alone.

457
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:45,000
But do something.

458
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,333
Let there be light, let there be life.

459
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,875
She's humiliated us, let's go.

460
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,375
Mister.. Listen...please..

461
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,375
At least have a glass of water.

462
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:07,791
You're back..

463
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:14,041
Now we all suffer. - Listen to me, brother.

464
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:23,041
Will you stop laughing?

465
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:23,915
Papa...

466
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,625
I want a divorce.

467
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,250
Go ahead if you want to.

468
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,375
Someday I'll get furious and.

469
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,333
But why?

470
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:34,166
There's nothing left between us to talk.

471
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,500
We fight over every trivial thing.

472
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,666
She doesn't understand, neither do I.

473
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:39,791
Uncle's been drinking.

474
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,833
And this mental asylum incident was just too much.

475
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,625
How did you land in the mental asylum?

476
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:49,250
I can't make break bread for him at midnight.

477
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,250
What more can I do? I'll keep it aside, they'll eat it cold.

478
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,166
Mannu.

479
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,958
I'm was being tortured for the past 4 years.

480
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,375
Don't forget to eat. - We will.

481
00:24:57,875 --> 00:24:58,458
We all are.

482
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,833
Your wife won't come feed you. I am not destined to have a daughter-in-law.

483
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:07,750
Look at me...I've been enduring it for 40 years.

484
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,166
And I am sure, so is your mother.

485
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,333
Who will clean all the dirty plates in the sink?

486
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,333
So.. - So what?

487
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,916
Manage it.

488
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:23,208
And then...there's this.

489
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:27,166
Sometimes with water...or with soda.

490
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,958
And sometimes neat.

491
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,458
What do you think will happen after divorce?

492
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:36,833
Either you will spend the rest of your life alone.

493
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,916
All the lights in the rooms are switched on.

494
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,750
All the lights are on.

495
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,291
You'll get bored...with living alone.

496
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,416
Or...you'll get married again.

497
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:49,625
And after the second marriage..

498
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,625
..do you think she will make you happy?

499
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,750
How can we clean it with the lights off?

500
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,458
You're too much.

501
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:06,375
Son...it's the rule of life.

502
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:11,416
A man and a woman are supposed to fall in love.

503
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:12,875
Then getting married..

504
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:15,791
..and then, getting bored of each other.

505
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,041
That's right.

506
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:22,416
That's why I say... endure it for as long as you can.

507
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:25,916
And when you give up.

508
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:27,375
What happened?

509
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:28,458
Save electricity.

510
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:29,750
I say divorce her.

511
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,583
You're like a closed door and sister-in-law is like the breeze.

512
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:32,916
You two can never get along.

513
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,166
I told you before this marriage will never last.

514
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,958
You can't temper lentil with ajinamoto.

515
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:39,541
Look, a criminal.

516
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,375
Mister. Where can I get a divorce?

517
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,250
I'll show you. There's Faisal.

518
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,250
There he is. Faisal.

519
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,791
Brother Faisal has a record of 2500 divorces.

520
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,375
Once he got a couple divorced on the following day of their wedding.

521
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,125
Come.

522
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,041
Greeting, brother. - Get going.

523
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:56,125
Sit down.

524
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,625
Sit down.

525
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,708
Mister, I want to send a divorce notice.

526
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,458
Of course. Just say the word.

527
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,875
Brother.. Think about it once.

528
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:14,000
I mean...think about it once.

529
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,833
So...which notice should I send her?

530
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,583
Divorce notice or just notice?

531
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:20,458
What?

532
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:21,916
Well, the divorce notice means..

533
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:25,791
..everything's finalized... marriage over!

534
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:33,625
But, with just a notice you still have some chance left.

535
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:36,458
Take my advice, and just send her a notice.

536
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:38,791
This is just the beginning. You're the emotional type.

537
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,458
You can never say "Divorce! Divorce! Divorce!"

538
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:47,291
And you see...marriage is an expensive game.

539
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,333
And divorce.

540
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,500
Well, you can get one for as cheap as 250- rupees.

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,958
Name?

542
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,958
Hold on.

543
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,458
Should I call him? - Yes.

544
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,541
Say sorry? - Yes.

545
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:09,458
Say "Call that stupid fool".

546
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:11,708
Call that stupid fool

547
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,708
Here.

548
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,000
Here, Tanu. Have some sweets.

549
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,416
I cleared my final year of law.

550
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:24,916
Chintu, you didn't call me sister.

551
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:25,833
Today is a good day.

552
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:29,000
Sister...there's a letter for you.

553
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,583
Son, have some.

554
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:34,583
Soon I'll have your room too.

555
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,041
There's a letter too.

556
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,375
Read it out...loudly.

557
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,083
My dear Tanu.

558
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:49,000
I never imagined that I'll be sending this letter to you.

559
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,708
But things have gone too far now.

560
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,250
You've crossed all limits.

561
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,125
But there's still time.

562
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:59,625
If you mend your ways and apologies..

563
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,625
..then I am ready to forgive you.

564
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:05,875
Waiting for your call.

565
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,666
Yours truly, Manu.

566
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:13,083
It's from brother-in-law.

567
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,833
Son, do you only speak like that, or do you write like that too.

568
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:17,791
No, I write clearly.

569
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,083
Then write him a letter in red.

570
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:23,541
I am done respecting you.

571
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,208
Go.

572
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,916
Chintu, you became a lawyer today..

573
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:31,125
..and you also got your first case.

574
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:34,708
Come on, get your bike.

575
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:38,708
I'll show you all of Batman's legends.

576
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:47,708
"O Beloved.."

577
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:52,000
"O Beloved...I'm bored of singing all those painful songs."

578
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,750
"Now there's rock-n-roll playing in my heart."

579
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,291
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

580
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:05,291
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

581
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:15,208
"Beloved Move on."

582
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:20,000
"Move on...on...on...on.."

583
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,958
"Move on...on...on...on.."

584
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:34,208
"Why look for another stranger?"

585
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:43,083
"Why look for another story?"

586
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,916
"The heart's happy wandering around."

587
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:48,291
"The heart's happy wandering around."

588
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,375
"The heart's happy wandering around."

589
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:54,916
"So why look for a place to stay."

590
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:59,583
"Why look for a place to stay."

591
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:04,125
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

592
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:08,958
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

593
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:13,500
"Move on."

594
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,291
"Beloved Move on."

595
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:22,791
"Move on...on...on...on.."

596
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:27,916
"Move on...on...on...on.."

597
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:31,916
"Whenever I start a new world."

598
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:46,083
"I'll also find a new God."

599
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,916
"If I don't find someone capable."

600
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,833
"If I don't find someone capable."

601
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,250
"If I don't find someone capable."

602
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,916
"Then I'll be God myself."

603
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:02,500
"Then I'll be God myself."

604
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

605
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,041
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

606
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:18,791
"O Beloved...I'm bored of singing all those painful songs."

607
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:23,625
"Now there's rock-n-roll playing in my heart."

608
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:28,000
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

609
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,708
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

610
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:37,416
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

611
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:42,291
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

612
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:46,750
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

613
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:52,083
"Beloved Move on." "Move on. Move on. Move on."

614
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:56,083
"Move on."

615
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:08,166
Let me introduce you to the villain of my story.

616
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:12,166
Chintu, do I look okay?

617
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,208
What happened?

618
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:20,208
Don't just stand there, come on.

619
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:40,750
After this we'll go get something to eat

620
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,750
Hello

621
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,750
The moustache looks nice on you, Awasthi

622
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,458
You've turned quite spiritual. - Yes

623
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:58,166
I took my mind of you and into God.

624
00:33:58,666 --> 00:33:59,458
Good

625
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,833
You should keep yourself busy

626
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,958
How's the doctor?

627
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,916
How are husbands?

628
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:13,458
Don't know. I'll tell you by next year

629
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:14,750
Really?

630
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,750
So you're taking the leap too

631
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,875
Yes.

632
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,750
Finally I found a girl I like

633
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,458
Oh dear!

634
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:29,375
So my ship sank close to the shore

635
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:35,208
Now that I am back, you're leaving

636
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:37,708
Well...anyway

637
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:43,291
Chintu, let's go. - Yes

638
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,625
See you brother

639
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:49,208
Hey boy.. - Yes, brother?

640
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:50,208
Who are you?

641
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,375
Me... Shoulder! - Who?

642
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:54,375
Shoulder

643
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,666
You know...the breed of boys.

644
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,583
We come into the picture when girls are very sad.

645
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,750
Fed up of all her relations.

646
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,500
When you shunned her, that doctor gave her his shoulder.

647
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,458
Now when the doctor shunned her, I gave her mine.

648
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:09,166
And when I do the same, you can offer her yours.

649
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:12,750
I'll take your leave. Madam has places to go.

650
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,000
Hey... - Yes brother?

651
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,916
Stay within your limits, son.

652
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:22,916
Or you'll end up hurt

653
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:34,416
You think your wife will jump out of the phone if you keep staring at it?

654
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,166
Look...shall I tell you where you went wrong?

655
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,208
The day sister-in-law realizes..

656
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:43,750
..she will come running and apologies to you.

657
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,375
And Listen..

658
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:46,916
Have some pity on poor guys like us.

659
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:48,583
Talk to Komal's family.

660
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,708
Please... Do you want me to beg?

661
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,750
Please.. - Fine, I'll talk to them. Sit.

662
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,583
You don't care at all

663
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,333
Sorry Pappi. I've made you all sad.

664
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,041
No seriously.

665
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,750
There's a lecture at Delhi University day after tomorrow.

666
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:05,708
Okay.

667
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,333
We'll head for Chandigarh right after that.

668
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,791
Really? - Yes.

669
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:09,416
Wonderful.

670
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:12,000
And you can fulfill your dream of getting married. - Of course.

671
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,083
That's more like it.

672
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,583
My marriage will be an example for your marriage.

673
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,458
And just watch how it's done.

674
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,583
You will be uncle in a year.

675
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:22,833
For instance, there are two types of Arithmia.

676
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,250
The bi-cardia and the tri-cardia.

677
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,458
Bi-cardia, where the heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute.

678
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,291
And tri-cardia where the heart rate is..

679
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:32,875
..more than 100 beats per minute.

680
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:36,875
Both cause symptomatic problems like these.

681
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,250
Its...

682
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:50,375
Very rare that you see a phenomena, like this.

683
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:56,916
I am sure it's also very dangerous.

684
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,291
So..

685
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,416
We're very lucky to have Dr. Radheshyam Agarwal..

686
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:03,458
..who is an expert on this subject..

687
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,083
..and who has agreed to speak on my behalf.

688
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:09,083
Dr. Radheshyam Agarwal!

689
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:16,583
Dr. Agarwal, please come.

690
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,958
I told you about the test, remember. Now go.

691
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:32,208
Get your physical done.

692
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:36,208
Oh God!

693
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:41,541
Any question?

694
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,458
Sir, which is the more common phenomena?

695
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:48,458
Bi-cardia or tri-cardia?

696
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,458
Good question.

697
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:58,625
You're a good question.

698
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,625
Next.

699
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:22,250
Doctor, why are there more heart-related diseases in India..

700
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,250
..than in any other country?

701
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,166
What's your name? - Anirudh.

702
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:32,333
3rd year student. - Anirudh.

703
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,083
Anirudh, good question.

704
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,083
But your question hurt me.

705
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,250
It's paining me.

706
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,458
Excuse me, doctor. - Yes, doctor.

707
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,791
Can you check what's happening? - Yeah, sure,

708
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,625
Here? - Here?

709
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:48,750
Doctor. Doctor, relax.

710
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,500
His question.. - Doctor, relax.

711
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,625
Lie down.

712
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,833
Lie down. Doctor, relax.

713
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,083
Doctor.

714
00:38:56,583 --> 00:39:03,125
Doctor, relax. Somebody call the ambulance, please.

715
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,333
She will apology...

716
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:09,333
...when she will realize.

717
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,708
You fool...

718
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,375
Are you crazy?

719
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,875
What were you doing with your arms spread out?

720
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,583
This is no place to be Shahrukh Khan.

721
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,458
I thought.. - What did you think?

722
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,625
That I am Manisha Koirala?

723
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,666
Come on, Dhatto. - Coming.

724
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,541
Shameless...good for nothing perverts.

725
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:36,250
We'll miss our bus.

726
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,208
What happened?

727
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,833
He was standing in the middle of the pitch.

728
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,791
I am injured now. - Are you hurt?

729
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,791
Old fool.

730
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,625
Hurry up. Come on.

731
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,916
Put the stretcher in the ambulance.

732
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:55,333
Pappi.

733
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,375
Come quickly.

734
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,625
Come on.

735
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,250
Sir, relax. Sir..

736
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:04,708
Quick quick

737
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,375
Come on.

738
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:07,583
Do you know what happened?

739
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,416
Sir..

740
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:11,541
I've been noticing that..

741
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:13,875
..the Sharma family enjoys embarrassing me.

742
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:16,333
Listen to me. Tanu is right here.

743
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:17,541
I'll show you.

744
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,625
What? Who?

745
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:20,583
Tanu.

746
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:24,583
Oh, God!

747
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,166
Isn't that, Tanu? - Which one?

748
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,750
That boy-cut. That's not sister-in-law Tanu.

749
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:32,916
Aren't you wearing your glasses?

750
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,458
Pappi, that's Tannu. - She isn't.

751
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:40,000
What if she is? - And what if she isn't?

752
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,041
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. - Quiet.

753
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,291
How can she be Sister-in-law?

754
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:49,250
Did she go back to college?

755
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,250
Lovers like you cause half the pollution in Delhi.

756
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,416
How can you say she's sister-in-law Tanu?

757
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:16,583
That's someone else.

758
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,541
She isn't?

759
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,125
And will you follow anyone who looks like her?

760
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:23,791
Go on.

761
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,958
Come on, let's go to ISBT.

762
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,791
I see no hope, nor a face.

763
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:31,958
Death is inevitable.

764
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,791
But why can't sleep at nights.

765
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:40,541
Very impressive Chintu!

766
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:41,833
Who's it now?

767
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,750
My soul mate.

768
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,375
Hello. - Payal.

769
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,708
Where are you? - Kanpur.

770
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:53,750
Listen...today is the function for the kid.

771
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,041
Everyone's so happy.

772
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,000
That's a good thing.

773
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,750
Do you know who I met today?

774
00:41:59,250 --> 00:41:59,833
Awasthi.

775
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:00,791
Raja.

776
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,916
He's grown a moustache now.

777
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:04,208
He looks hot.

778
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:06,375
Listen Tanu.

779
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,666
Don't get yourself in these hassles.

780
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,083
I am telling you because I already am in one.

781
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,458
Believe me, it's no use. You feel really guilty.

782
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,375
Guilty? Why?

783
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,541
Isn't this Jassi's kid?

784
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,791
Yes...it's not.

785
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,750
I'll tell you in detail when we meet.

786
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,250
Tanu, come here soon. Or else I'll die of guilt.

787
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,791
You've made this really exciting.

788
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:30,291
She's Mr. Trivedi's daughter, isn't she?

789
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:31,375
Yes.

790
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,750
So why are you taking her around?

791
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,875
She's married. - Are you her father-in-law?

792
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,875
Mind your own business.

793
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:48,416
Your moustache is beautiful.

794
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:59,208
You know, perverts love a book called Lolita.

795
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,166
Have you read it?

796
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:06,750
You see...a middle-aged man keeps staring at a little girl.

797
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,416
She wasn't even born when you completed your graduation.

798
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:13,250
Look, I'll lodge a complaint with the police.

799
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,958
There are 1500 students here.

800
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,833
If they all slap you..

801
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,125
Oh, God. - Get out before she gets here.

802
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,833
Oh, God.

803
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,833
Don't look. Don't look.

804
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,750
Hey come come

805
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,333
This is a DTC bus. Anyone can board it.

806
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:36,208
Come on. - Pahad Ganj bus depot.

807
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,458
Come on.

808
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,208
Keep your bag on your lap.

809
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:44,291
Shut up.

810
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:50,458
If these people find out we're following that girl..

811
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:54,625
They will beat us black and blue.

812
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:55,958
Whistle?

813
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,375
You don't know what's a whistle?

814
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,291
Remember those toy dolls we used to play with when we were kids.

815
00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:02,750
And if you pressed that doll, it would..

816
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,083
Ticket?

817
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,375
Staff. - What staff?

818
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,333
Delhi University, don't you see?

819
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:09,958
This is the DTC bus...

820
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,750
No concession to any staff.

821
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,916
How much? - 10.

822
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:17,291
And how much for your windscreen?

823
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,291
You fool, one brick..

824
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,791
..and you'll lose 10,000 instead of 10.

825
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,333
Ticket?

826
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:30,541
Brother...if this girl finds out we're following her..

827
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:34,250
..then she will beat us to a pulp.

828
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,708
You do understand that don't you?

829
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,666
This one...our..

830
00:44:39,166 --> 00:44:41,375
It's called something more crude in Punjabi.

831
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:42,833
I..

832
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,041
Ticket.

833
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:49,041
Staff!

834
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,750
Brother, you didn't eat your almonds

835
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:08,625
I'll need money today.

836
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,250
Walk straight. Straight..

837
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,333
Don't look.

838
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:22,375
What are you doing?

839
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,583
We can pay you only 200

840
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:26,833
Don't look at her.

841
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:28,791
Okay how about 250?

842
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:32,791
How much is that for?

843
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:41,791
Look at this one

844
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:46,500
Sit carefully.

845
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,958
Keep your knees to yourself.

846
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,541
Sit carefully.

847
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,458
Don't look at her. - How's your stomach?

848
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,875
What? - How's your stomach?

849
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,416
I kicked you the other day, remember.

850
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,333
Yes, it's fine.

851
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:06,750
Thank you.

852
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,125
Mister, why do I feel like you're following me?

853
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:15,875
No, it's not that.

854
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,833
Just tell me who you're following. Me or her?

855
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,458
We've a bet going.

856
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,041
No, it's not what you think.

857
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:24,791
Stop the rickshaw.

858
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,416
Stop. Stop.

859
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,125
Loveboy. You say you're not following me.

860
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,541
Get down. - Listen to me.

861
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:34,791
You're mistaken. I am not following you.

862
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,541
You look like my wife. You look like my wife.

863
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:39,625
Listen to me..

864
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:41,916
Just listen to me..

865
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,208
I am a doctor.

866
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:44,875
Will you listen to me?

867
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:48,333
My wife looks.. Look..

868
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:50,875
You look like my wife.

869
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,541
Wait..

870
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:57,833
Look. Take a look.

871
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,958
Your wife does look like me.

872
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,125
Normally we see this in films.

873
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:05,541
I never imagined I could have a lookalike.

874
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,583
She does look a bit like her.

875
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,458
But is she dead?

876
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:11,916
No...

877
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:15,958
Did she run away? - No..

878
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,208
She left me.

879
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:23,166
We're getting divorced. - Oh..

880
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:24,583
That's sad.

881
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:26,666
But, mister, the reality is..

882
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:28,875
Your wife looks just like me..

883
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,208
..but I am not your wife.

884
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:31,583
My name is Kumari Kusum Sangwan..

885
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:32,666
..and this is my friend Pinky.

886
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,666
We study at Ramjas College, Delhi University.

887
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:37,166
I got admission through sport's quota. I am a national level athlete.

888
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,833
District Jhajjar, 12 45 07.

889
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:42,791
And I won't give my phone number.

890
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,166
No, I..

891
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:49,791
I thought...

892
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,208
Never mind, I am sorry.

893
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,583
Mister... - I want to say sorry too.

894
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,000
I misunderstood you.

895
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,916
I can't make you happy like your wife.

896
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,333
But if you ever want to taste home-made food..

897
00:48:03,833 --> 00:48:04,750
..you can come see me.

898
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,791
I bring lunch from home.

899
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:12,125
Keep the lights on.

900
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,875
I'm applying medicine.

901
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:18,041
My knee's cracked-up. Listen, its creaking.

902
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:20,000
Switch it on.

903
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,541
You silly man!

904
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,625
This is the first time I got beaten up by a girl.

905
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:28,625
My entire personality is completely shattered.

906
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,250
Stop.

907
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,833
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

908
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,416
Stop. Stop. Stop.

909
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,708
Turn around

910
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,250
What? What? What? What?

911
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,625
What? What are you thinking?

912
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:48,625
No. Not at all.

913
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:49,458
No.

914
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:51,416
This is called extra-marital affair.

915
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:52,916
Illicit relation.

916
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:57,875
Illegal affairs

917
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,041
This is where it all begins.

918
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:01,916
No, no, don't laugh.

919
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:04,250
You'll remember what I said when you're in a jam.

920
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,416
No, don't to the dark path.

921
00:49:06,916 --> 00:49:10,416
Understand? Don't.

922
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,958
This is where it all begins.

923
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:19,208
Look.. You're head over heels for that child.

924
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:24,166
She's dancing around because she passed.

925
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,250
Who is it? - Mr. Sharma.

926
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,041
Here she comes.

927
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,833
I passed.

928
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,708
I had no hope, but I passed.

929
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,250
This calls for a party.

930
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,583
Party?

931
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,833
Wow, we're going boating.

932
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,333
Mister...you should pedal too.

933
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:48,208
How am I supposed to when you have broken my legs?

934
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,416
What?

935
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:53,375
There's a handle. I'll pedal using this.

936
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:56,916
It's a wonderful ambiance, Mr. Sharma. - Right.

937
00:49:57,416 --> 00:49:59,916
Sing a song for me.

938
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,500
I can't sing. - Everyone can sing.

939
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,833
I can't. - Shall I?

940
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,833
Of course. - I learnt it on BBC radio.

941
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:16,458
"I might be sentimental."

942
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:21,041
"But don't get so judgmental."

943
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:25,125
"So what I am an old-school girl?

944
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,708
Am I singing in accent? - Haryanvi?

945
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:31,708
No, American. - No, not at all.

946
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:40,250
"I might be sentimental."

947
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:45,000
"But don't get so judgmental."

948
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,083
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

949
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,166
"I am an old-school girl."

950
00:50:51,666 --> 00:50:55,125
"I am an old-school girl."

951
00:50:55,625 --> 00:51:00,458
"I might be sentimental."

952
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:05,166
"But don't get so judgmental."

953
00:51:05,666 --> 00:51:09,250
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

954
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,375
"I am an old-school girl."

955
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:15,375
"I am an old-school girl."

956
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:40,958
"Darling though we're from different time-zones."

957
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:46,458
"I still can call you any time on your telephone."

958
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:52,541
"But I really long... for your handwritten letters."

959
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:57,083
"You.. baby those days are gone."

960
00:51:57,583 --> 00:52:01,833
"I love the smell of your palm and your ink."

961
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:07,041
"One letter from you just makes me love your everything."

962
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,250
"All sweet nothings you don't write..

963
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,083
"..between your lines."

964
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:16,416
"My heart can hear them every single time."

965
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:21,333
"I might be sentimental."

966
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:26,041
"But don't get so judgmental."

967
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:30,166
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

968
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:32,291
"I am an old-school girl."

969
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:36,291
"I am an old-school girl."

970
00:52:56,833 --> 00:53:02,625
"I'll fight with the world if it comes to that."

971
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:07,541
"Be a big girl to prove I am right."

972
00:53:08,041 --> 00:53:13,166
"But every time you say goodbye."

973
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:14,500
"I swear to God.."

974
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
"I cry! I cry! I cry!"

975
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,833
"I cry! I cry! Boy, I cry!"

976
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,208
"I cry! I cry!"

977
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:25,125
"Every time you say goodbye."

978
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:26,041
"I swear to God.."

979
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,375
"I cry!

980
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,958
"I might be sentimental."

981
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,583
"But don't get so judgmental."

982
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:36,958
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

983
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:42,250
"I might be sentimental."

984
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,208
"But don't get so judgmental."

985
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:49,458
"So what if I'm an old-school girl."

986
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:52,375
"So what if I am an old-school girl."

987
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:57,416
"I am an old-school girl."

988
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,041
Mister, two glasses of juice.

989
00:53:59,541 --> 00:53:59,958
Mr. Sharma.. - Orange?

990
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,458
Orange? - Yes.

991
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,250
Yes, orange juice.

992
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,250
I am scared of dogs myself.

993
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,875
Mr. Sharma, until now boys have been..

994
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,791
..either my brothers or competition.

995
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:19,291
I never had any other kind of relation with them.

996
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:22,375
I have lot of responsibility on me.

997
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,458
People will say..

998
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:27,208
Dhatto went to Delhi to be famous..

999
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:29,875
..but she fell in love instead.

1000
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,750
You see...no other girl will ever be allowed..

1001
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,208
..to leave Jhajjar again.

1002
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:38,250
My sister-in-law has someone in mind for me.

1003
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,291
You were someone's husband.

1004
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:45,750
Let's end this right here.

1005
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,833
When it has no future..

1006
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:52,125
..there's no point in going through all the trouble.

1007
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:54,000
Like they say..

1008
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,250
Precaution is better than cure.

1009
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:03,083
You see, I don't know myself what's happening and why.

1010
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:06,166
But I.. - See you, Mr. Sharma.

1011
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:08,666
Keep them safe.

1012
00:55:09,166 --> 00:55:12,583
I heard gold's getting expensive.

1013
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:18,083
"Every time you say goodbye."

1014
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:19,500
"I swear to God.."

1015
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,750
"I cry! I cry! I cry!"

1016
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,958
"I cry! I cry! Boy, I cry!"

1017
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,958
"I cry!"

1018
00:55:45,416 --> 00:55:47,541
For you.

1019
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:51,541
Here.

1020
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:01,041
She sent a divorce letter.

1021
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:03,625
Manu, I'll find someone better.

1022
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:07,625
It's not too late for you to get married again.

1023
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:18,500
Hello. Is that Manoj Sharma speaking?

1024
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,166
Yes, speaking.

1025
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:23,333
This is Tanuja's Lawyer, advocate Arun Kumar Singh.

1026
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,458
I am sure you received the notice.

1027
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:27,125
Yes.

1028
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:30,458
Well, I was thinking about giving you another piece of news.

1029
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:34,250
At your wedding, there was another horse along with yours.

1030
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,333
So that horse is back.

1031
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:40,458
You must have heard about Raja Awasthi.

1032
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:41,791
Yes, so don't forget.

1033
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:43,708
So, I'm hanging up.

1034
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:47,375
Mr. Trivedi. Hold on.

1035
00:56:47,875 --> 00:56:52,750
Now listen to him.

1036
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,750
Pappi.

1037
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:03,833
Let's go ask him.

1038
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,916
Him? He's stealing electricity.

1039
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:09,291
Sir. - Sir?

1040
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,458
Sir, what's Om Prakash Sangwan's address?

1041
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:14,916
Pocket B, 411/2...that one..

1042
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:17,666
Strange, he knows it by-heart.

1043
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,166
Yes, I am Om Prakash Sangwan.

1044
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:20,541
Oh God..

1045
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,541
What do you want? - Let's go. Come on.

1046
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:33,333
Uncle.

1047
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,875
Uncle, here's your 6 months' rent.

1048
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,333
Uncle, last night I was in tears..

1049
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:40,958
..while thinking about you.

1050
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,375
I realized how I've wronged you.

1051
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:45,166
In the morning, I went straight to the bank.

1052
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:46,750
Took money from my FD..

1053
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,583
..and came straight to you with the money.

1054
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,375
Keep the money.

1055
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,333
Uncle, take my advice..

1056
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,916
..and put some money away in a FD.

1057
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:57,375
You don't have a son.

1058
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,333
All you have is a daughter, who is out of control.

1059
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:01,208
If you save some money..

1060
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:06,041
..at least you won't have to wander around.

1061
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,625
What insolence is this? - Exactly.

1062
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:12,416
If you had been strict with your daughter at the right time..

1063
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:15,458
..then she wouldn't have been in this mess.

1064
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,625
Gunjan Talkies is screening Aashiqui 2, matinee show.

1065
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:20,333
Along with Raja Awasthi.

1066
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:24,833
Songs are being sung...bangles are tinkling.

1067
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:30,125
"Are you listening.."

1068
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:34,125
"I am crying.."

1069
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:54,750
Look, Manu. I am not against love marriage at all.

1070
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,958
I had a love marriage too. - I see.

1071
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:58,708
And on top of it, it was inter-caste.

1072
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:00,541
I also have a small daughter.

1073
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:01,666
Great.

1074
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,666
But there is a problem.

1075
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,416
But I can't understand what the problem is.

1076
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:11,416
Normally there are problems in a love marriage.

1077
00:59:14,916 --> 00:59:17,208
But...Manu, I would still say that..

1078
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:22,041
..you should talk to Kusum once.

1079
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:24,708
You see...if my sister's willing..

1080
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,916
..that doesn't mean we don't have a problem.

1081
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:28,166
There's still a problem.

1082
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:32,166
But only then can I tell you what the problem is.

1083
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:43,416
Manu, please talk to Kusum.

1084
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:47,041
I'll be right back.

1085
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:51,041
Keep the door open.

1086
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,291
This isn't the first time I've fallen in love, Kusum.

1087
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,625
I was in love with someone before.

1088
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,666
I've worn my wedding attire before, ridden the horse before..

1089
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,291
..and taken the nuptial rounds with someone before.

1090
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,125
I've laughed with someone cried behind someone's back.

1091
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:25,875
I lost trying to build a home.

1092
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,291
And I lost so badly..

1093
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:32,083
..that I strongly detest this husband-wife relation.

1094
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,250
But after I met you..

1095
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:39,750
..I felt like I had the courage to repeat this mistake again.

1096
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,291
If someone who's scared of love..

1097
01:00:41,791 --> 01:00:44,666
..falls in love again, then it must be something special.

1098
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:47,375
All I would like to say is..

1099
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,875
I will love you, and keep you happy.

1100
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,208
Support you in joy and sorrows.

1101
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,666
And every time you win a competition, Tanu..

1102
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:59,666
Kusum.

1103
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:04,291
See...I told you this has happened before.

1104
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,541
I've said these things before.

1105
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:10,541
But you happened to me for the first time.

1106
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,166
Brother, there's an outbreak of cholera in Delhi.

1107
01:01:18,666 --> 01:01:19,000
I see.

1108
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,708
So be careful with the fritters.

1109
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:24,333
And I told you... there will be a problem.

1110
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:26,708
There's always a problem in love marriages.

1111
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,041
See, there's a problem.

1112
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,541
What?

1113
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:32,375
Well, my missus says that he's a divorcee..

1114
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:36,000
Which you already told me.

1115
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,666
But I don't have an objection, but my wife does.

1116
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,083
And secondly...

1117
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:44,791
She's already chosen Kusum..

1118
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:48,541
..for one of her distant brother.

1119
01:01:49,041 --> 01:01:49,916
He belongs from your side.

1120
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,041
UP. Take a look.

1121
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:57,041
You might have seen him before.

1122
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:06,958
What's going on here?

1123
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,083
Stop this.

1124
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:12,291
Manu Sharma, trying to be Shahrukh Khan, huh!

1125
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:14,291
"This has happened before."

1126
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:15,750
"This has happened before."

1127
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,041
I'll tell you what happened before.

1128
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:20,583
He tried to snatch your wife before.

1129
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,583
And you left this poor boy hanging.

1130
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,458
Last time he was busy giving justification..

1131
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:27,625
..but this time he'll shoot first and talk later.

1132
01:02:28,125 --> 01:02:30,083
No. Why give any justification.

1133
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,250
He'll shoot first and get going.

1134
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,666
What justification?

1135
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:35,791
Just shoot.

1136
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:37,333
Why justification?

1137
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:39,291
Pappi, what are you saying? - Pappi?

1138
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:42,375
He'll be taking your pappi (kiss) now.

1139
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:46,541
She's supposed to be marrying him.

1140
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:50,166
I am feeling uneasy.

1141
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,166
Pappi, brother!

1142
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:09,458
You see, women are like blending machine..

1143
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:10,916
..and men are the fruit.

1144
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:12,458
And for the last two weeks..

1145
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,416
..we were hovering around this machine.

1146
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,708
One wrong move, and..

1147
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:19,791
And that Raja Awashti.

1148
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:23,708
He would've rained bullets on us.

1149
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,083
I saved you.

1150
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,166
Your father came to us with the proposal.

1151
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:29,708
Manu had no dearth of marriage proposals. - Who is she yelling at in the morning?

1152
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:33,416
There are plenty of them out there.

1153
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:34,916
What's wrong, aunty?

1154
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:36,416
We had to get you two married..

1155
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:39,458
..because he was in love with you.

1156
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:41,625
It's the machine! The machine.

1157
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:43,041
You've made a mess of things.

1158
01:03:43,541 --> 01:03:45,166
Mr. Sharma.. - This is my new coat.

1159
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,333
I had warned you that she isn't the right girl.

1160
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:51,333
But you let her father cloud your judgment.

1161
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,625
She couldn't even abide by the marriage for 4 years. - Who?

1162
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,041
And look at that haircut she's got.

1163
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,458
Look at those fangs.

1164
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:02,458
What are you blabbering? - Where are you going?

1165
01:04:10,625 --> 01:04:12,083
Where's Chintu?

1166
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,208
At the next shop.

1167
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:17,208
Add some small pieces catechu.

1168
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:21,250
Why did you tell papa about me and Raja?

1169
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,750
I even told your husband. - Why?

1170
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,708
Why?

1171
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:28,458
Why did Ranjha die?

1172
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,583
Why did Farhad die?

1173
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:33,125
Why did Romeo stab himself?

1174
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:37,000
And why do millions of girls slit their veins?

1175
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,166
Love.

1176
01:04:39,666 --> 01:04:40,916
Tanu, I was in love with you.

1177
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:42,458
You're crazy.

1178
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:46,750
I am married. - That's just your marital status.

1179
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,416
But you're a still a bachelor at heart.

1180
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:52,333
And...I already sent the divorce letter to your husband.

1181
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:53,666
What?

1182
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:56,416
When? - I sent it yesterday, by Blue Dart.

1183
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:58,458
I'm sure he's already received it.

1184
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:01,208
It's only the seven nuptial rounds, Tanu.

1185
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:04,291
You won't mind taking them again.

1186
01:05:04,791 --> 01:05:07,166
I can give my life for you.

1187
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:09,208
Hey...don't touch me.

1188
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:10,916
This is the problem.

1189
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:13,625
One smile...and you think the girl's crazy about you.

1190
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,875
Was I just a bike and one liter of petrol for you?

1191
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,333
Only good for taking you to Raja Awasthi.

1192
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,541
I warned you.

1193
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,041
It takes 2 hours to get to Kanpur from Lucknow.

1194
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,666
Raja.. - And you!

1195
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,041
You husband-wife have made my life bad.

1196
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:29,208
Quietly get on the bike and come with me.

1197
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,333
And you..

1198
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:33,750
You're just a shrimp, understand.

1199
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,458
You..

1200
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:40,458
Don't just insult me and leave, Raja Awasthi.

1201
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:41,666
Finish me. - Let go.

1202
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,166
Just finish me for good. I am a serpent.

1203
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:46,458
I'll make your life miserable.

1204
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:47,458
Wait...

1205
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:52,375
I will kill you. - So kill me.

1206
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:53,416
Stop.

1207
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,875
He will shoot you.

1208
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,958
I won't spare you.

1209
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:02,958
Make another betel leaf.

1210
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:08,458
Your courage has filled me with zest.

1211
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:11,083
You aren't over your first wife yet..

1212
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,375
..and already locking horns with the bull.

1213
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,208
Bull?

1214
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:16,750
I have a brother.

1215
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,875
Not Omi, another one.

1216
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,666
When he was just 5, he tried to wrestle a bull.

1217
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:23,083
Got his bones broken.

1218
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,333
After he got better, he tried to wrestle it again.

1219
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,083
And broke his bones again.

1220
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,458
When he got better again..

1221
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:31,958
..the fool tried to lock horns with it again.

1222
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:35,291
People say my brother is crazy.

1223
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:39,250
But I like my brother.

1224
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,000
And you too.

1225
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,958
Mr. Sharma, I've decided..

1226
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:47,000
..that I'm going to take the bull by its horns.

1227
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,000
We'll see what happens.

1228
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:55,458
You do love me, don't you?

1229
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,458
No, I'll believe it when you say it convincingly.

1230
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,000
'Say it convincingly, or I'm getting out of here.'

1231
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:30,166
Yes, I do.

1232
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:33,166
Great, then let's go to Jhajjar.

1233
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,083
Let's go deal with my family.

1234
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:40,208
Don't be afraid if they beat you up.

1235
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,750
If you're doing a good deed, then don't forget me.

1236
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,666
Komal's getting married in 3 days.

1237
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:46,750
Let's go to Chandigarh.

1238
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,000
Pappi, if it's an emergency..

1239
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,125
..then we'll deal with your problem first.

1240
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:53,875
What now? Pack your bags.

1241
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,875
Let's go to ISBT. Catch the bus to Punjab.

1242
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,583
Yes.

1243
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,000
Are you crazy?

1244
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,250
You think I'm going to booze during daytime.

1245
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,333
Don't you see I am with a lady?

1246
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,791
Sorry!

1247
01:08:09,291 --> 01:08:11,583
What happened? Why are you getting so furious?

1248
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,833
You see, Tanu, your doctor husband..

1249
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,625
..is just bad news.

1250
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,708
And he's back in my life.

1251
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,791
And this time...I won't let him get the best of me.

1252
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:23,041
I will shoot him.

1253
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:26,125
Why are you abusing him? Tell me what happened.

1254
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,416
Four years..

1255
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:30,750
It took me four years to find this girl.

1256
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,541
I didn't talk or meet her, just said yes to marrying her.

1257
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:36,250
Why?

1258
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,625
Because...

1259
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:39,583
She looked like you.

1260
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,625
I thought if not you, then maybe someone like you.

1261
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:45,208
But your husband can't endure that either.

1262
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:48,000
He wants the original as well as the duplicate.

1263
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,375
What are you saying? I don't understand.

1264
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:51,500
What do you mean?

1265
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,375
I mean he's been getting cozy with my fiance, in Delhi.

1266
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,250
Who?

1267
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:58,625
Manu? - Yes.

1268
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:00,416
Who told you? - My sister.

1269
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:02,875
But you don't have a sister. - She's a distant cousin. You don't know her.

1270
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,625
Where does she live? - Delhi.

1271
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:06,291
Where in Delhi?

1272
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:07,000
Uttam Vihar.

1273
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,583
But Manu lives in Mayur Vihar.

1274
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:10,208
Maybe they met someplace else, I don't know.

1275
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:11,625
He's in love with your sister.

1276
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:13,541
Not my sister, her sister-in-law.

1277
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,541
But you said he's been going around with your sister.

1278
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,250
Hey Tanuja Trivedi.

1279
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,916
Are you a RAW agent?

1280
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:20,708
Just try to understand what I am saying.

1281
01:09:21,208 --> 01:09:23,166
Your husband's in love again.

1282
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:24,458
He's betrayed you.

1283
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,416
He's given you the finger, and getting married again.

1284
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:30,416
And all this is ruining my life.

1285
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,708
He cannot show me the finger.

1286
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:38,875
What could be better than..

1287
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,041
..a man settling down at the age of 40.

1288
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:43,666
Shut up!

1289
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:44,958
Shut up!

1290
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:48,958
Don't you see we're talking here?

1291
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,083
He cannot show me the finger.

1292
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:55,250
He's a small potato.

1293
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,250
I don't care if he's a potato or apple.

1294
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,083
Either you return my fiance..

1295
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,333
..or you come back in my life.

1296
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,666
I am a simple contractor.

1297
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,125
I don't have much brain.

1298
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:09,333
But I do know one needs cement to join bricks.

1299
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:14,250
I don't care if its JK cement or Ambuja cement.

1300
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:18,250
But this should happen at all cost, that's all.

1301
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:33,250
Mister, will you take us to Sector 16?

1302
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,458
Here.

1303
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,416
Manu's gone, daughter-in-law.

1304
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:47,125
What do you want now?

1305
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:48,416
Didn't you feel ashamed..

1306
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:49,833
..when you sent him to the mental asylum?

1307
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,291
I don't need him.

1308
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,000
In fact he needs my permission. I am still his legal wife.

1309
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:57,083
I can make all of you rot in jail.

1310
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,000
That's all there's left for you to do.

1311
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,000
You have done everything else.

1312
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,166
So this is where Jassi lives now? - Yes.

1313
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:16,041
Stay back.

1314
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:17,208
Why?

1315
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,208
No need to hide, let's go inside.

1316
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:22,458
We're not here on a holiday.

1317
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,708
We're here to elope with the girl.

1318
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:27,041
Komal is Jassi's cousin.

1319
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,833
If these Sardar's find out..

1320
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,583
..they will abuse me to death.

1321
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:32,333
You.. why you..

1322
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:33,625
What rubbish.

1323
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:37,041
Jassi's my friend. I'll talk to him. - Don't...No.

1324
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:38,416
Now it's too late.

1325
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:41,500
You already missed the deadline.

1326
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,791
Datto.

1327
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,583
If you're caught eloping with the girl..

1328
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:47,750
..they will beat you up terribly.

1329
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,666
Strangely I have faith in you.

1330
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:51,541
You can do this.

1331
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,250
You must tell her once..

1332
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,666
..that Pappi's here for you. - Right.

1333
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,875
Well then...do you have a picture of her on your mobile?

1334
01:11:58,375 --> 01:11:58,708
I do.

1335
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:00,125
You see, everyone knows us.

1336
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:01,458
If we go inside, they will never leave us alone.

1337
01:12:01,958 --> 01:12:03,875
You go inside and tell her.. - I get it.

1338
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:05,666
Komal...your Pappi's here.

1339
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:06,958
No need to worry.

1340
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:10,416
He'll jump over this wall of wealth and take you away.

1341
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,375
See... See that.

1342
01:12:12,875 --> 01:12:14,125
That's a city girl.

1343
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,333
But they will recognize her too.

1344
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:19,583
She's Tanu, right.

1345
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:22,833
She's Datto.

1346
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:25,875
Yes, but they will think she's Tanu.

1347
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:31,791
She is Datto, so everyone will think she's Datto.

1348
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:34,458
Tanu..

1349
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:38,458
Ohhh...they will think she's Tanu.

1350
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:51,666
Datto...

1351
01:12:52,166 --> 01:12:55,666
Please wear the Turban.

1352
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:08,291
Please wear the Turban.

1353
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,541
Datto... walk carefully.

1354
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:25,791
Sister, have you seen this girl around?

1355
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:30,875
Sister, have you seen this girl around?

1356
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:33,791
Tanu!

1357
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:37,791
Tanu!

1358
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,666
Manu.

1359
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:46,541
Jassi. - Mannu, my buddy. What are you doing here?

1360
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:49,125
How are you?

1361
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,750
Everyone has changed in 4 years.

1362
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,666
You guys were crazy back then, and you still are.

1363
01:13:55,166 --> 01:13:58,666
Why are you doing this?

1364
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:13,125
What...what are you doing?

1365
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:14,375
Sister-in-law Tanu.

1366
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:17,083
Aren't you ashamed?

1367
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:18,083
Why would I be ashamed?

1368
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:20,833
Pappi is going crazy for you.

1369
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:22,416
And you want to know why you should be ashamed.

1370
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,875
Pappi's here too. - He's here for you.

1371
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:25,833
Pack your bags.

1372
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:29,833
He's waiting outside by the rickshaw. Hurry up.

1373
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:33,833
For me?

1374
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:40,625
Tanu. Hello.

1375
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,750
Hi.

1376
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,791
This frock doesn't match with your turban and beard.

1377
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:57,958
It's all okay.

1378
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,166
Komal's would-be husband is from Gujarat.

1379
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:01,708
Get it. That's why..

1380
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:05,083
So you're going to do the 'Dandiya'. - Of course.

1381
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,333
We'll do the 'Dandiya'.

1382
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,416
And not just me, you will too.

1383
01:15:08,916 --> 01:15:09,500
Not me. Come on. - No, not me.

1384
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,291
Oh, come on.

1385
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:13,458
I don't want to. - Oh, Come on. - Jassi, listen to me.

1386
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:14,875
Hold on. - Hello.

1387
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:16,333
Hand me the mic.

1388
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:19,333
Listen up everyone.

1389
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:22,333
My best friend Manu..

1390
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:25,041
..has returned from London's mental asylum.

1391
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,541
And I am really happy.

1392
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:27,666
Very happy.

1393
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:32,458
I've a humble request, please dance.

1394
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:35,208
And I swear, those who don't dance..

1395
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:40,375
..tomorrow morning your mother will die.

1396
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,250
Come on.

1397
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:43,833
There's nothing I want to tell you.

1398
01:15:44,333 --> 01:15:45,583
I don't love you.

1399
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,583
How long are you going to lie to yourself?

1400
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:49,208
That's the limit.

1401
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:50,916
I am not lying to you.

1402
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,958
You're just a good friend, Pappi.

1403
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:55,166
You know.. Just like whatsapp friend.

1404
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:57,208
Whatsapp friend?

1405
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,541
Then what was all that LOLs for?

1406
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,333
LOL at 3 am...

1407
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,458
Those big LOLs for every small jokes.

1408
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:05,541
What was all that?

1409
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:07,333
Listen...I took that overcrowded..

1410
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:08,625
..Punjab Roadway's bus to get here.

1411
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:10,750
And you're refusing me.

1412
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,166
You...

1413
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:15,083
You've lost your mind.

1414
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:16,166
Listen.

1415
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:19,625
Tanu, I couldn't conceive.

1416
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,083
My family was bothering me.

1417
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:22,416
Why aren't you getting pregnant? When will you bear a child?

1418
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:23,541
When? How?

1419
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:24,666
They really got on my nerves.

1420
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:27,083
We met all the doctors, got all the tests done.

1421
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,458
And then I found out..

1422
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,666
..that Jassi was the one.

1423
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,625
See...Jassi was infertile.

1424
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,416
Be a man. Be a man. - Listen to me.

1425
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:35,291
Drink it. - Come on.

1426
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:39,291
It's important. - Drink it. What are you doing?

1427
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:51,791
That was neat.

1428
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,458
Jassi...listen.

1429
01:16:55,958 --> 01:17:01,041
Jassi, I am getting married again.

1430
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:04,875
You manned up in a single drink. - Yes.

1431
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:08,041
You cannot betray me. - What betrayal?

1432
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,791
Did I ever say that I love you? Never!

1433
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:14,083
That's only because you're shy. - Shy my foot.

1434
01:17:14,583 --> 01:17:15,541
I don't love you.

1435
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,458
And anyway, the wedding's day after tomorrow..

1436
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:18,416
..and I am really happy.

1437
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:21,125
You'll have to get married over my dead body, believe me!

1438
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,625
Fine with me, just stop following me.

1439
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:28,458
Such arrogance! Such arrogance!

1440
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,958
I wouldn't have given you a second look if I was any younger.

1441
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,791
Two really hip girls from my neighborhood proposed to me..

1442
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,125
..but I refused them only for you.

1443
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:39,291
Understand. Listen..

1444
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:41,250
If you don't love me yet, then do it now.

1445
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,000
Have you lost your mind?

1446
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,250
Do you have any idea..

1447
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,125
..how much property my husband has in Surat?

1448
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:51,458
Even I've booked a shop in Greater Noida.

1449
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,666
I have a receipt.

1450
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:56,458
So Jassi ruined all my plans of family planning.

1451
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,125
Then I talked to Sukanya.

1452
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:00,250
What's wrong?

1453
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,208
What? - I need to go to the bathroom.

1454
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:05,250
Fine, we're talking after a long time.

1455
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,166
Sit down.

1456
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:09,333
Do you know where I met Sukanya?

1457
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:11,875
She said if your husband cannot give you a child..

1458
01:18:12,375 --> 01:18:15,208
..then try artificial insemination.

1459
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:17,625
So that child is artificial.

1460
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:19,541
Have you lost your mind after going to London?

1461
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:20,875
The child isn't artificial.

1462
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:22,666
I mean...it's science.

1463
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,958
It's done with injection... and costs millions.

1464
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:27,416
It's like...test tube baby.

1465
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:28,958
And so costly..

1466
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:33,416
How much does kid this size cost?

1467
01:18:33,916 --> 01:18:35,750
The child grows in your fetus, not the thermos.

1468
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,000
Have you lost your mind?

1469
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,541
Am I drunk or are you?

1470
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:43,875
This new haircut suits you.

1471
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:47,166
Why are you buying the same color Mercedes again?

1472
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:48,583
Why don't you change color?

1473
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:49,666
What do you mean?

1474
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:51,541
This one's like Tanu too.

1475
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,250
You could've tried something else.

1476
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:57,666
Like Aishwarya...Deepika...Katrina.

1477
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,083
There are many new ones in the market now.

1478
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:01,625
But you're doing great.

1479
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,958
My life is ruined.

1480
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:07,125
Pappi!

1481
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,333
Come in.

1482
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:11,208
Pappi. - Jassi.

1483
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:15,500
Pappi, how are you? - Great.

1484
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,083
Have a drink? Where were you?

1485
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,541
Some cripple was bothering me.

1486
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,458
Manu, there is some cripple in the party.

1487
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:27,375
Where is he?

1488
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,541
Who? - Pappi.

1489
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:33,708
Pappi was never here, Jassi.

1490
01:19:34,208 --> 01:19:36,000
He was just saying..

1491
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,458
Jassi, I think you're drunk.

1492
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,791
Pappi isn't here. Listen to me.

1493
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,250
Get some rest.

1494
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,875
Here. Drink it.

1495
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:48,250
Are you there, Manu? - Come on. Drink it.

1496
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,791
No one knows that this child isn't Jassi's.

1497
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:52,583
They never leave her alone. Right?

1498
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:54,000
No one leaves her alone..

1499
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,916
They're always carrying her in their arms.

1500
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:57,750
Tanu..

1501
01:19:58,250 --> 01:19:58,875
I have to go to the bathroom.

1502
01:19:59,375 --> 01:20:00,125
The bathroom's this way.

1503
01:20:00,625 --> 01:20:01,791
Tanu, I feel really guilty.

1504
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:02,958
What do I do? Should I tell them?

1505
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,125
But if I tell him, it will hurt his manhood.

1506
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:06,250
They're such ignorant people..

1507
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,000
..they measure their manhood with their sperm count.

1508
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,916
Look there..

1509
01:20:11,416 --> 01:20:11,916
Oh...

1510
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:14,250
How did you do that? Did you hit her here? Karate.

1511
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,833
What else could I do? She wasn't letting me leave.

1512
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:18,583
I see. - Did she finish packing her bags? Shall we go?

1513
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:21,666
She says she doesn't love me.

1514
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:23,708
Doesn't love you?

1515
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:25,291
So...were you mistaken..

1516
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:27,791
..or is she going back on her words.

1517
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:30,208
She's the one who's denying it. She still does.

1518
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:31,750
Then let's get out of here.

1519
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,416
I think she'll say yes if you talk to her.

1520
01:20:34,916 --> 01:20:35,750
What do I say to her?

1521
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,916
If she isn't listening to you why will she listen to me?

1522
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:41,958
No, no, I think she'll say yes if you talk to her.

1523
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:45,000
I should try talking to her once. - Yes.

1524
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,750
This side.

1525
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:51,750
You fools, Shahrukh Khan's outside.

1526
01:20:56,458 --> 01:20:58,208
Come on.

1527
01:20:58,708 --> 01:20:59,375
What are you doing?

1528
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:02,166
That's what I want to ask you...

1529
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:04,708
Listen, listen... - Now, what are you doing?

1530
01:21:05,208 --> 01:21:06,375
Look, I'll scream.

1531
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,750
Your family's already making quite a racket.

1532
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,625
Who's going to hear you? Listen to me.

1533
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,958
What's your problem with this good man?

1534
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,083
What's so special about that boy from Surat?

1535
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:20,500
Money. Even Pappi can earn a square meal.

1536
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,791
He loves you. He came this far for you.

1537
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:25,083
And you don't care.

1538
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:26,958
Shut up!

1539
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:29,458
Fools. Run away.

1540
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,291
She isn't listening.

1541
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:33,375
Shall I show her too?

1542
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:37,375
Look..

1543
01:21:40,791 --> 01:21:43,458
What's wrong with her? - She's drunk.

1544
01:21:43,958 --> 01:21:46,916
Drunk?

1545
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,500
Payal.

1546
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,958
There was no Shahrukh Khan.

1547
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,333
She tricked us.. - She fooled us.

1548
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:57,541
What happened? Payal? Payal?

1549
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:01,041
Payal?

1550
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,750
That's him. Yes, him. This guy was sitting there.

1551
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,916
Catch him. Don't let him go!

1552
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:09,916
Pappi..

1553
01:22:15,916 --> 01:22:17,291
She has put on a lot of weight.

1554
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,333
You take so long.

1555
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:22,750
Right, as if you were missing your flight.

1556
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:26,750
Mr. Sharma! - Mr. Sharma!

1557
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:35,000
Let's go. Let's go.

1558
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,125
Run.

1559
01:22:38,625 --> 01:22:40,041
Come on, shift to second gear.

1560
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:44,041
Second.

1561
01:22:45,291 --> 01:22:48,791
Stupid.

1562
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:08,583
Thank you.

1563
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,416
You know, Dhatto Manju is getting married today.

1564
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:20,333
Manju, you're getting married today.

1565
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:22,541
Yes.

1566
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:24,291
Brother, keep sister-in-law there.

1567
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,541
Dhatto is back.

1568
01:23:26,041 --> 01:23:27,333
Greetings, grandma. - Greetings.

1569
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:28,583
Where's everyone?

1570
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:33,375
They're all at Manju's place. Today is the musical ceremony at her place.

1571
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:37,750
Give that to me, Mr. Sharma?

1572
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,083
Whose dead body is that? - Which one?

1573
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:41,166
This one.

1574
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:44,250
Mr. Sharma, what will my brother..

1575
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:47,916
..call your brother's wife?

1576
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:51,000
What will he call her, Pappi? -Aunty.

1577
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,166
She's your aunty.

1578
01:23:52,666 --> 01:23:53,375
And who's this man?

1579
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,125
Will you tell anyone? - No, I won't.

1580
01:23:55,625 --> 01:24:00,833
No, you will tell everyone. - I will not. Give me 100 rupees.

1581
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:04,833
He's your brother-in-law.

1582
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:14,500
I got 100 rupees. I got 100 rupees.

1583
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,666
Dhatto's brought brother-in-law home.

1584
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:21,166
Come here.

1585
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:22,791
Sir, we did the best we could.

1586
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,458
Call the Commissioner first.

1587
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:28,458
Why do you drink so much if you can't digest it?

1588
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:37,666
Tanu?

1589
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:39,750
Weren't you ashamed? - Look, mister..

1590
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:42,291
Take him away! You brought these idiots back home with you.

1591
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:44,250
You went out to be famous.

1592
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,708
Now I'll show you. - Show me what.

1593
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,250
I am not your wife. I am a state level athlete.

1594
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:51,083
I'll show you instead. I'll have you arrested.

1595
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:56,708
These idiots have polluted your mind..

1596
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,208
Leave my hand, Dhatto.

1597
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,083
Don't humiliate your family.

1598
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:01,958
I'm not even scared of my father.

1599
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:07,291
Hey take her away! - "I'm in love."

1600
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:13,166
"In love with you again."

1601
01:25:13,666 --> 01:25:18,041
"Tell me what to do."

1602
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:23,833
"What to do?"

1603
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:29,291
"I'm in love."

1604
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:34,875
"In love with you again."

1605
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:40,333
"Tell me what to do."

1606
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:45,708
"What to do?"

1607
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:47,833
They're trying to burn us? - What?

1608
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:48,750
Set us on fire.

1609
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,791
Mister..

1610
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:52,583
Listen, mister. - PT Usha...now I'll show you.

1611
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,041
Listen..

1612
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:55,500
You cannot take the law in your hands.

1613
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,208
What are you doing? - Hand us over to the police.

1614
01:25:57,708 --> 01:25:58,375
Get lost.. go get the matches.

1615
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,333
Matches...for what?

1616
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:03,416
But he did come here, didn't he? - Yes..

1617
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:06,875
You were saying that..

1618
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,458
Stop this nonsense.

1619
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:10,875
And try to understand what I am saying.

1620
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,166
Let's get to Kusum's village immediately..

1621
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:13,666
..or else we'll reach only after the wedding.

1622
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:16,208
Village? You said she lived in Delhi.

1623
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:18,208
Her brother lives in Delhi.

1624
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:21,125
Her entire family lives in the Jhajjar district.

1625
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:23,125
Tanu, life has already served me many blows..

1626
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:24,208
..don't humiliate me anymore.

1627
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:25,583
Sir...get the car.

1628
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:28,958
Your friend has nipped you badly.

1629
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:32,958
Get the Pajero!

1630
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:37,750
Brother, give me your matches.

1631
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,208
How are you? - Give me the matches.

1632
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,083
What will you do with them?

1633
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:46,166
We need to burn two people.

1634
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:47,041
Move aside.

1635
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:48,791
Here. Burn them. - Burn them.

1636
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:50,416
Hey.. - Wait. Let him burn them.

1637
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:54,666
Give it here. Shut up! Shut up!

1638
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,291
What's going on here?

1639
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:01,291
Have you all lost your mind?

1640
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:10,166
What?

1641
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:11,833
Nothing.

1642
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:15,916
You could've changed first.

1643
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:19,250
For 18 years, we've been fighting over this.

1644
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,291
This is exactly why I left home.

1645
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:22,458
I quit wrestling.

1646
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:24,625
I will get a small job, live in a small home..

1647
01:27:25,125 --> 01:27:28,125
..but stay away from ignorant' like you.

1648
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,958
And keep my sister away too.

1649
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:33,791
The girls world-over are making progress.

1650
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:37,166
But you...keep your daughters tied to your courtyards.

1651
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:38,916
Don't let them make any progress.

1652
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:41,625
Either you kill them before they are born.

1653
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:45,375
And if she grows up, then strangle her to death.

1654
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,166
Weren't you ashamed of assaulting..

1655
01:27:47,666 --> 01:27:49,458
..a girl that carved a niche for herself.

1656
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:51,541
Speak up. Why don't you speak?

1657
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,750
You think beating these girls make you a man.

1658
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,666
She could've eloped and got married.

1659
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:56,791
But her mistake was..

1660
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,041
..she came to get permission from idiots like you.

1661
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:00,833
Omi, we aren't against it.

1662
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:02,583
But there's something as community.

1663
01:28:03,083 --> 01:28:03,833
Right.

1664
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:06,708
You all belong to the royal families of Rajasthan, don't you?

1665
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,416
Which is why you're so concerned about your community.

1666
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:12,458
And uncle, do you belong to the dinosaur family?

1667
01:28:12,958 --> 01:28:14,250
And if your daughter married someone else..

1668
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,416
..we'll all go extinct.

1669
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:19,541
Look, he's absolutely right. In fact, I would say.. - Be quiet.

1670
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,125
The can of kerosene is still besides us.

1671
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,750
He's doing good, let him.

1672
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:24,958
Brother Omi, please send Dhatto.

1673
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:30,000
I applied henna on one hand now I need to get my other hand done.

1674
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,125
Go, dear. She's upstairs.

1675
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,583
Take her along.

1676
01:28:34,083 --> 01:28:37,666
Everyone listen carefully.

1677
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:38,875
She's my sister.

1678
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:41,041
She can marry anyone she wants.

1679
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:42,708
Just try and stop her.

1680
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:46,708
And I'll show you what brains are for.

1681
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:10,125
"Like a hot-air balloon she's rising up."

1682
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,083
"No one can lay a hand on her."

1683
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:16,375
"The girl's shining like thunder."

1684
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:21,083
"Issued in the interest of public interest."

1685
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:25,291
"Now you handle this responsibility."

1686
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:30,041
"She keeps chatting...waves her hands around."

1687
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:33,958
"Never takes a backseat."

1688
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:38,583
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

1689
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:42,708
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1690
01:29:43,208 --> 01:29:47,375
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

1691
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:51,791
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

1692
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:56,250
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

1693
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,250
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1694
01:30:10,458 --> 01:30:14,416
"You're pure gold, neither silver nor copper."

1695
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:18,416
"Every subject she touches...she's a topper."

1696
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:27,708
"She flies away with her own wings proper."

1697
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:32,125
"Even bhangda feels proud if you accept its offer."

1698
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:34,541
"Never listens...always stubborn."

1699
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:36,625
"And the sharp wit."

1700
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:40,875
"She's a double-edged sword."

1701
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:43,333
"Don't know if she's coming or going."

1702
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:45,541
"She's running around in the lane."

1703
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:49,875
"Better be prepared."

1704
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,041
"She jumps around."

1705
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:54,500
"She leaps and pounces."

1706
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,375
"She never looks relaxing."

1707
01:30:58,875 --> 01:31:02,916
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

1708
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:06,458
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1709
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:07,458
"..Beautiful."

1710
01:31:07,958 --> 01:31:11,750
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

1711
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:15,750
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

1712
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:50,208
Come.

1713
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:52,375
Listen don't try to stop me today.

1714
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:55,083
Yeah...yeah....we'll see.

1715
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:58,333
Look there.

1716
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:00,833
Hey got it!

1717
01:32:01,333 --> 01:32:06,125
You can't stab me again and marry her.

1718
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:10,125
What happened, mister?

1719
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:18,750
Hey...Hanuman.

1720
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:22,000
Sister-in-law...you?

1721
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,250
Trying to sneak away. - No, no. I...was..

1722
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,458
Where's your brother?

1723
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:29,125
Who? Manu?

1724
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:32,833
I haven't met him for years. Is he here?

1725
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:34,208
Where's Komal? - Komal who?

1726
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:36,125
Komal. - Hold on.

1727
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,500
I saw her at the ice-cream counter.

1728
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:39,291
Komal.

1729
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:40,041
What?

1730
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:41,791
Forgive me, brother.

1731
01:32:42,291 --> 01:32:42,916
By the time I got there..

1732
01:32:43,416 --> 01:32:44,541
..they had already kidnapped her.

1733
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:47,750
Sister-in-law, it's all ruined.

1734
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,041
Hold on.

1735
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:53,041
Komal, look who's here for you.

1736
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:02,000
O Doctor!

1737
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:09,458
Wow, Mr. Sharma.

1738
01:33:09,958 --> 01:33:11,875
I turned sordid..

1739
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:14,583
..but you turned completely shameless.

1740
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:15,791
Don't worry.

1741
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,625
I only came here to see your bride.

1742
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:22,625
Who is the one who did what I couldn't do in four years?

1743
01:33:54,500 --> 01:34:00,208
Awasthi, you said she looks like me.

1744
01:34:00,708 --> 01:34:04,208
Settle for reebook instead of Reebok, right?

1745
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:10,958
Mr. Sharma, you found her to replace me?

1746
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:15,333
This joker. This ignorant.

1747
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:17,166
You deserve better than this.

1748
01:34:17,666 --> 01:34:18,958
I deserve better than this.

1749
01:34:19,458 --> 01:34:21,458
You should've thought about my honor at least.

1750
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:23,958
Hey girl...come to your senses.

1751
01:34:24,458 --> 01:34:25,333
Talk respectfully.

1752
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:28,375
You're laughing at me. What about you?

1753
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,041
You couldn't manage your own home.

1754
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:33,666
Your father raised you first and then, Mr. Sharma took care of you.

1755
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:35,833
You never even bought an underwear with your own money.

1756
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:37,250
Laughing at me.

1757
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,500
You can see the world, booze and buy fashionable clothes..

1758
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
..with his credit card.

1759
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,166
How can you call me ignorant?

1760
01:34:42,666 --> 01:34:45,375
I got admission in Delhi University through sports quota.

1761
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:47,333
I am a state level athlete.

1762
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,458
Calling me ignorant.

1763
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:52,583
And listen...I am not over smart like you.

1764
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,458
But I can earn a penny for my family..

1765
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:55,625
..and also take care of the kids.

1766
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:57,125
You cannot even earn a penny..

1767
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:01,125
..and kids are not your cup of tea.

1768
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:05,625
What are you staring at me for?

1769
01:35:06,125 --> 01:35:06,750
Aren't you going to say something to her?

1770
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,916
No one's going to say anything.

1771
01:35:09,416 --> 01:35:11,291
One has to maintain relations to keep them.

1772
01:35:11,791 --> 01:35:15,291
You shut up, you... - Tanu!

1773
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:25,125
Omi, fix a date for the marriage.

1774
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,791
Can I garland her?

1775
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:36,000
Go on. Go on. Everyone look here.

1776
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,458
Tanu

1777
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:40,583
Speak in

1778
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:42,125
Hello...just because you're in Haryana..

1779
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:43,958
..you cannot speak in this new and new feudal terms.

1780
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:45,625
Okay? She's chosen to be a woman of leisure.

1781
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,083
What can you say?

1782
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:49,416
Tell your husband how you had your kid.

1783
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:53,875
Madam... what do you mean by how?

1784
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,958
This is as usual.

1785
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:58,208
I'll tell you the truth.

1786
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:01,750
Tell her.

1787
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:04,250
Speak up.

1788
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:08,708
In the hospital, where else?

1789
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:11,166
What will happen to you now, dear?

1790
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:15,125
Your loving father even refuses to see your face now.

1791
01:36:15,625 --> 01:36:17,125
Or your mother's face.

1792
01:36:17,625 --> 01:36:18,541
We're ruined.

1793
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,458
You're ruined too, Tanu.

1794
01:36:20,958 --> 01:36:26,125
That long-fanged witch devoured your marriage.

1795
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:28,583
And she ruined my marriage too.

1796
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:30,458
Idiot.

1797
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:31,583
She broke my neck.

1798
01:36:32,083 --> 01:36:34,916
Broke our marriages.

1799
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:38,333
Bad.

1800
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:39,833
This is it, Tanu.

1801
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:40,916
Love, affection, inter-caste marriage...

1802
01:36:41,416 --> 01:36:43,375
Bindi, bangles, the nuptial rounds, I love you..

1803
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:45,916
Just one artificial insemination, and everything's over.

1804
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:48,333
"What kind of love is this?"

1805
01:36:48,833 --> 01:36:52,125
What was that song we used to sing when we were in 1st year.

1806
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:53,458
Have you lost your mind, Tanu?

1807
01:36:53,958 --> 01:36:56,333
You aren't listening to what I am saying.

1808
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:59,666
"What is this love...this affection."

1809
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:04,291
You used to sing that, right?

1810
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:08,291
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1811
01:37:25,958 --> 01:37:30,458
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1812
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:36,125
"What is this love...this affection."

1813
01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:41,625
"You're no one's beloved."

1814
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:47,458
"All your promises are fake."

1815
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:51,458
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1816
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:10,333
"I've seen your loyalty."

1817
01:38:10,833 --> 01:38:16,125
"And the unanswered prayers."

1818
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:21,875
"You didn't think about my heart."

1819
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:27,541
"I've seen your loyalty."

1820
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:33,291
"And the unanswered prayers."

1821
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:38,750
"I've seen your loyalty."

1822
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:42,750
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1823
01:38:56,583 --> 01:39:01,583
"Why shouldn't I sigh with sorrow?"

1824
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:07,458
"I miss you, what to do."

1825
01:39:07,958 --> 01:39:13,250
"Just tell me oh ignorant."

1826
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:18,750
"Should I live or die thinking of you."

1827
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:24,666
"Just tell me oh ignorant."

1828
01:39:25,166 --> 01:39:30,416
"Should I live or die thinking of you."

1829
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:36,041
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1830
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:41,541
"What is this love...this affection."

1831
01:39:42,041 --> 01:39:46,958
"You're no one's beloved."

1832
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:53,291
"All your promises are fake."

1833
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:57,291
"Go away...O Betrayer."

1834
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:14,875
What's all this?

1835
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:24,666
That Kusum humiliated me..

1836
01:41:25,166 --> 01:41:34,041
..and you just stood there, and said nothing.

1837
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:38,541
I was always like that, crazy.

1838
01:41:39,041 --> 01:41:42,541
When did you change, Mr. Sharma?

1839
01:41:46,958 --> 01:41:50,458
Don't you miss me?

1840
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:01,250
I don't.

1841
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:43,833
Will you come along without asking any questions?

1842
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:47,833
If it's not too urgent, can I take a bath?

1843
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,958
What is this?

1844
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:01,958
Divorce papers.

1845
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:09,458
Congratulations.

1846
01:44:36,750 --> 01:44:40,041
I am very embarrassed for whatever happened yesterday.

1847
01:44:40,541 --> 01:44:43,000
But Mr. Sharma has done a lot of favors on me.

1848
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:47,708
He handled all the arrangements in my marriage.

1849
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:50,458
If I can help out in his marriage..

1850
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:55,083
..I may be able to repay a part of my debt.

1851
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:59,083
Please!

1852
01:45:09,333 --> 01:45:12,041
When is the marriage? - On the 18th..

1853
01:45:12,541 --> 01:45:16,041
Great, you'll be out of here in a week.

1854
01:45:27,458 --> 01:45:33,125
"The horizon's empty, where do I look for you?"

1855
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:38,375
"Where are you, I can't see you...listen to my heart calling out."

1856
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:41,416
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1857
01:45:41,916 --> 01:45:44,458
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1858
01:45:44,958 --> 01:45:47,666
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1859
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:51,541
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1860
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:54,666
"I yearn for you, makes me breathless."

1861
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:58,666
"My heart's lonely."

1862
01:46:27,958 --> 01:46:33,666
"What bond is this? I can see it in your eyes."

1863
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:40,625
"What bond is this? I can see it in your eyes."

1864
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:46,958
"It's getting crushed between two hearts."

1865
01:46:47,458 --> 01:46:53,125
"It's getting crushed between two hearts."

1866
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:58,458
"Don't ignore your heart."

1867
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:01,625
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1868
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:04,458
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1869
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:07,666
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1870
01:47:08,166 --> 01:47:11,500
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1871
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,541
"I yearn for you, makes me breathless."

1872
01:47:15,041 --> 01:47:18,541
"My heart's lonely."

1873
01:47:29,625 --> 01:47:32,125
"My heart's full of love."

1874
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:35,208
"It's a stubborn bird."

1875
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:38,333
"My heart's full of love."

1876
01:47:38,833 --> 01:47:42,333
"It's a stubborn bird."

1877
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:48,541
"Expectations have clipped my wings, but hope keeps me alive."

1878
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:54,666
"Expectations have clipped my wings, but hope keeps me alive."

1879
01:47:55,166 --> 01:48:02,333
"Don't ignore my humble request.. - More water. - Listen.

1880
01:48:02,833 --> 01:48:04,541
What's wrong with you? Why are you doing this?

1881
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:06,291
I don't know.

1882
01:48:06,791 --> 01:48:07,958
I love you, Mr. Sharma.

1883
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:10,750
I know you can't live without me either.

1884
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:12,583
You think we'll all do as you want.

1885
01:48:13,083 --> 01:48:13,708
And no one will say anything.

1886
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,250
You can say anything you want but let's go home, please.

1887
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:17,791
Don't you get it, Tanuja Trivedi.

1888
01:48:18,291 --> 01:48:19,750
Everything is over! It's over.

1889
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,208
After a point of time one gives up. So did mine.

1890
01:48:22,708 --> 01:48:25,666
I can't do anything more than this. Please, go away.

1891
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,916
I haven't given up yet, Manoj Sharma.

1892
01:48:29,416 --> 01:48:32,708
I will leave only after I see you married.

1893
01:48:33,208 --> 01:48:33,416
Tanu!

1894
01:48:33,916 --> 01:48:36,958
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1895
01:48:37,458 --> 01:48:39,750
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1896
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:42,875
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1897
01:48:43,375 --> 01:48:46,833
"Don't go away...Don't go."

1898
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,875
"I yearn for you, makes me breathless."

1899
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:53,875
"My heart's lonely."

1900
01:49:10,125 --> 01:49:11,833
I warned you before.

1901
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:14,583
The cold is getting worse.

1902
01:49:15,083 --> 01:49:17,416
And I also said..

1903
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:22,583
..that she should take care, but she didn't listen.

1904
01:49:23,083 --> 01:49:25,250
Now he's caught a cold.

1905
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:28,833
Kusum.

1906
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:32,833
Can we talk for a minute, please?

1907
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:36,458
Do you stitch shrouds too?

1908
01:49:36,958 --> 01:49:38,708
What are you saying?

1909
01:49:39,208 --> 01:49:41,333
If you don't, then get me a readymade one.

1910
01:49:41,833 --> 01:49:42,750
One for you and one for him.

1911
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,375
Shut up, Pappi.

1912
01:49:44,875 --> 01:49:46,333
Bless you, doctor.

1913
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:49,208
Getting a suit stitched again.

1914
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:52,416
I haven't had one chance of getting married..

1915
01:49:52,916 --> 01:49:56,583
..and he's looking to score once again.

1916
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:57,791
Are you blind?

1917
01:49:58,291 --> 01:49:59,375
Don't you see your wife?

1918
01:49:59,875 --> 01:50:02,208
Look at her condition. She's gone crazy?

1919
01:50:02,708 --> 01:50:05,708
Is this why you faced me so bravely that day?

1920
01:50:06,208 --> 01:50:08,083
You should've let me marry her instead.

1921
01:50:08,583 --> 01:50:10,083
I loved her, and I would've handled her too.

1922
01:50:10,583 --> 01:50:11,916
And that girl...Datto.

1923
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:13,458
She thinks there's nothing wrong..

1924
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:14,916
..if her face matches with Tanu.

1925
01:50:15,416 --> 01:50:16,291
This is a sin.

1926
01:50:16,791 --> 01:50:17,958
It's a sin. Big sin.

1927
01:50:18,458 --> 01:50:19,708
He's a sinner.

1928
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:23,750
He thinks she's nave and innocent.

1929
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:25,916
And it's the same face he fell in love with the first time.

1930
01:50:26,416 --> 01:50:27,583
So pounce on it.

1931
01:50:28,083 --> 01:50:29,083
The old one's run her course.

1932
01:50:29,583 --> 01:50:31,333
That's not it. - That's exactly it.

1933
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,541
That's not it.

1934
01:50:34,041 --> 01:50:35,500
I didn't tell her to send me the divorce letter.

1935
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,125
That was a stupid fool boy from Rampur..

1936
01:50:38,625 --> 01:50:40,166
..who made all this mess.

1937
01:50:40,666 --> 01:50:41,416
Oh!

1938
01:50:41,916 --> 01:50:43,375
Forgive these two.

1939
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:44,666
Manu made a mistake.

1940
01:50:45,166 --> 01:50:47,000
And Tanu has never done anything right in her life.

1941
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,375
They both are big fools.

1942
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:49,791
But you're the smart one.

1943
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:51,625
Everyone can see their condition.

1944
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:55,500
They are so sad. You didn't notice because you're occupied.

1945
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,541
Husband and wife often quarrel.. - Madam.

1946
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:02,166
They were husband and wife.

1947
01:51:02,666 --> 01:51:04,208
But they aren't any more.

1948
01:51:04,708 --> 01:51:06,791
And what haven't I noticed?

1949
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:10,541
Are you crazy?

1950
01:51:11,041 --> 01:51:14,541
Didn't you notice the love between me and Mr. Sharma?

1951
01:51:17,666 --> 01:51:21,166
Raja, I am sorry you got involved in this again.

1952
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:24,583
Look, if I knew that Datto... - Forget that, doctor.

1953
01:51:25,083 --> 01:51:26,416
Tell me something new.

1954
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:29,625
I am shocked that I've been nipped in the bud again.

1955
01:51:30,125 --> 01:51:31,875
Let's be clear about what to do next.

1956
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:35,250
You tell me what we can do.

1957
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:37,208
All the arrangements are done.

1958
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:38,166
Nothing can be done now.

1959
01:51:38,666 --> 01:51:40,458
Why not?

1960
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:44,000
Say no to this marriage and go back with Tanu.

1961
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,958
And you...get lost.

1962
01:51:47,458 --> 01:51:50,958
Come on, get lost. No one's getting a suit stitched.

1963
01:51:53,083 --> 01:51:56,083
Look...I don't have all those qualities.

1964
01:51:56,583 --> 01:51:59,666
Just that I always stick to my word.

1965
01:52:00,166 --> 01:52:04,875
That day it was Tanu, and now with Datto.

1966
01:52:05,375 --> 01:52:06,000
See..

1967
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:09,666
If I can't do this, then I'll be just 80 kilos of dead meat.

1968
01:52:10,166 --> 01:52:10,458
Nothing more.

1969
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:12,791
What are you saying? What about the fact that you married Tanu..

1970
01:52:13,291 --> 01:52:14,250
..the same way.

1971
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:15,250
These days he's following in the..

1972
01:52:15,750 --> 01:52:18,416
..footsteps of Salman Khan on commitments.

1973
01:52:18,916 --> 01:52:19,875
But everything is not that simple.

1974
01:52:20,375 --> 01:52:21,416
Consider the entire matter first.

1975
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:23,625
Whatever it was, but they were married for 4 years,

1976
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:24,791
There are 2 families involved in this.

1977
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:26,750
How can Manu just marry someone.. - Look, sister..

1978
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:28,833
..I am getting married tomorrow.

1979
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:30,208
I am really busy.

1980
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:32,875
I know you're feeling bad about your friend.

1981
01:52:33,375 --> 01:52:34,791
But there's nothing I or Mr. Sharma can do.

1982
01:52:35,291 --> 01:52:38,250
Mr. Sharma wants.. - Look.

1983
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:41,416
If Mr. Sharma tells me that, I won't marry him.

1984
01:52:41,916 --> 01:52:45,416
Now get out.

1985
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:49,000
Where are you going?

1986
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:52,083
Everyone's left this guy behind.

1987
01:52:52,583 --> 01:52:55,041
Left him behind.

1988
01:52:55,541 --> 01:52:59,500
Where's mama? Where's mama?

1989
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,708
She left you.

1990
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:02,333
She left you.

1991
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:04,708
It was a mistake, Jassi.

1992
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:09,125
I didn't tell you because I didn't want to hurt you.

1993
01:53:09,625 --> 01:53:13,125
Forgive me.

1994
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,583
Mr. Sharma.

1995
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:36,583
I'll be right with you.

1996
01:53:38,958 --> 01:53:41,541
Mr. Sharma, Payal came to see me..

1997
01:53:42,041 --> 01:53:43,875
Nothing will change, Datto.

1998
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:46,750
All these things happening the past few days..

1999
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:50,041
Tanu coming here..

2000
01:53:50,541 --> 01:53:52,416
..I am really sorry for that.

2001
01:53:52,916 --> 01:53:58,375
You must have found me unsure, and..

2002
01:53:58,875 --> 01:54:02,916
All I want to say is don't worry.

2003
01:54:03,416 --> 01:54:06,916
I'll be a good husband.

2004
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:16,125
Then get ready and come to the dais.

2005
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:19,166
Yes, just hope things don't get in a mess later.

2006
01:54:19,666 --> 01:54:21,333
Let that go, dear. It'll tear.

2007
01:54:21,833 --> 01:54:24,458
Is it real? - Yes, absolutely real.

2008
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:27,166
We'll make a similar one for your groom.

2009
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:31,791
Get up everyone. The groom's here.

2010
01:54:32,291 --> 01:54:35,166
Why are you holding that?

2011
01:54:35,666 --> 01:54:38,000
Come on. Climb the horse.

2012
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,916
Can't we walk or go in a car?

2013
01:54:40,416 --> 01:54:41,250
What are you saying? It might be your second..

2014
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:42,541
..but it's my sister's first marriage.

2015
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:44,083
Come on, come on.

2016
01:54:44,583 --> 01:54:45,291
Bring the boy.

2017
01:54:45,791 --> 01:54:47,125
It's alright.

2018
01:54:47,625 --> 01:54:49,125
Don't be scared. Climb up.

2019
01:54:49,625 --> 01:54:49,791
Pappi.

2020
01:54:50,291 --> 01:54:52,458
Listen to me..

2021
01:54:52,958 --> 01:54:54,458
Give me a quarter.

2022
01:54:54,958 --> 01:54:57,000
What have you been drinking?

2023
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:01,000
Give it to me.

2024
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:09,625
Daddy, how about a drink? - Are you crazy?

2025
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:11,416
Fine, I'll have a peg. Give me 100 rupees.

2026
01:55:11,916 --> 01:55:12,708
I don't have money.

2027
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:14,416
What do you mean you don't? - I don't.

2028
01:55:14,916 --> 01:55:17,750
Old man...what about the 6 month of rent that I paid you.

2029
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:18,791
That was a year ago.

2030
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:20,041
Fine, you can deduct it from the dowry.

2031
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:21,041
What dowry?

2032
01:55:21,541 --> 01:55:22,541
That's not it. - What are you saying?

2033
01:55:23,041 --> 01:55:25,333
Uncle, everything is ruined and you're coming now.

2034
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:27,958
Why you..

2035
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:30,208
No need to be scared.

2036
01:55:30,708 --> 01:55:34,291
I'll break your head. - So hit me. Hit me.

2037
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:36,250
Throw away the stone.

2038
01:55:36,750 --> 01:55:39,833
We don't know whose side we're on.

2039
01:55:40,333 --> 01:55:41,458
We're on the right side.

2040
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:42,958
We're on the right side..

2041
01:55:43,458 --> 01:55:44,708
..but which is the right side?

2042
01:55:45,208 --> 01:55:48,708
The right thing to do is get out of here.

2043
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:56,000
How can we just leave, Awasthi?

2044
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:03,416
I want to feel humiliated some more.

2045
01:56:03,916 --> 01:56:07,416
Come in marriage party.

2046
01:56:22,541 --> 01:56:25,500
The smiles of their face, joys of the heart..

2047
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,500
..and shame, wonder what else your lovers have sacrificed for you.

2048
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:37,583
"O beloved.."

2049
01:56:38,083 --> 01:56:40,250
"O beloved.."

2050
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:44,625
"I did what I didn't want to, my world's come crashing down."

2051
01:56:45,125 --> 01:56:49,250
"I did what I didn't want to, my world's come crashing down."

2052
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:53,791
"A hale and hearty, good looking girl has gone crazy."

2053
01:56:54,291 --> 01:56:56,208
"I've gone crazy."

2054
01:56:56,708 --> 01:56:58,583
"I've gone crazy."

2055
01:56:59,083 --> 01:57:00,750
"I've gone crazy."

2056
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:03,000
"I've gone crazy."

2057
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,458
"I've gone crazy."

2058
01:57:05,958 --> 01:57:08,583
"I've gone crazy."

2059
01:57:09,083 --> 01:57:13,000
"Every morning... in the pitch darkness."

2060
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,208
"I ran from home."

2061
01:57:14,708 --> 01:57:17,833
"I ran from home only for you."

2062
01:57:18,333 --> 01:57:22,583
"Without a reason, in the middle of the night."

2063
01:57:23,083 --> 01:57:26,625
"I woke up in the middle of the night for you."

2064
01:57:27,125 --> 01:57:30,916
"Don't listen to the world, listen to what my heart's saying.

2065
01:57:31,416 --> 01:57:33,416
"I've gone crazy."

2066
01:57:33,916 --> 01:57:35,791
"I've gone crazy."

2067
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:39,791
"I've gone crazy."

2068
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:57,541
"Here and there, and everywhere."

2069
01:57:58,041 --> 01:58:02,208
"I've come back...back to you."

2070
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:06,791
"First the world and now the Lord itself."

2071
01:58:07,291 --> 01:58:10,708
"I've fallen in your love."

2072
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:15,375
"I hope you won't cry when I go away."

2073
01:58:15,875 --> 01:58:17,750
"I've gone crazy."

2074
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:19,958
"I've gone crazy."

2075
01:58:20,458 --> 01:58:22,208
"I've gone crazy."

2076
01:58:22,708 --> 01:58:25,166
"I've gone crazy."

2077
01:58:25,666 --> 01:58:29,791
"You have gone crazy."

2078
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:34,458
"Yes...you have... you have gone crazy."

2079
01:58:34,958 --> 01:58:38,458
"You've gone crazy."

2080
01:58:38,958 --> 01:58:42,625
"I've gone crazy."

2081
01:58:43,125 --> 01:58:46,750
Tanu!

2082
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:47,500
Dear.

2083
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,041
Greetings.

2084
01:58:48,541 --> 01:58:49,166
To bad with your greetings.

2085
01:58:49,666 --> 01:58:51,125
Aren't you ashamed of what you're doing here?

2086
01:58:51,625 --> 01:58:52,500
She is your daughter-in-law.

2087
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,500
Dear, let's go from here.

2088
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:02,333
Tanu, don't be scared. I am here.

2089
01:59:02,833 --> 01:59:03,625
Hey you..

2090
01:59:04,125 --> 01:59:04,583
Awasthi..

2091
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:07,333
Abuse me, but don't hit me. - Stop. Stop.

2092
01:59:07,833 --> 01:59:08,333
Who is he?

2093
01:59:08,833 --> 01:59:10,083
Tanu, what do you want?

2094
01:59:10,583 --> 01:59:12,166
I want to see Manu get married.

2095
01:59:12,666 --> 01:59:14,000
Don't beat me again.

2096
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,500
Move back! Move back!

2097
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,916
I've left a letter at Hazratganj police station..

2098
01:59:18,416 --> 01:59:19,583
..stating that if I don't return in 3 days..

2099
01:59:20,083 --> 01:59:22,041
..then Raja Awasthi is responsible for my death.

2100
01:59:22,541 --> 01:59:24,125
Should I drink this? Should I?

2101
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:25,958
You'll be charged with sections 302 and 307..

2102
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:27,583
..and rot in jail.

2103
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,916
Move. Move.

2104
01:59:30,416 --> 01:59:32,208
I am here for my bride.

2105
01:59:32,708 --> 01:59:36,208
Your time's up.

2106
01:59:58,875 --> 02:00:02,375
Now garland each other.

2107
02:00:06,125 --> 02:00:09,625
Now garland each other.

2108
02:00:21,958 --> 02:00:25,458
Now they'll pour the water.

2109
02:01:11,916 --> 02:01:15,416
Do you want to say something, Mr. Sharma?

2110
02:01:18,166 --> 02:01:19,416
This is the last round.

2111
02:01:19,916 --> 02:01:23,416
After this our marriage will be finalized.

2112
02:01:33,666 --> 02:01:37,166
I can't do it.

2113
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:44,416
I am an athlete, Mr. Sharma.

2114
02:01:44,916 --> 02:01:47,708
I either win or come last.

2115
02:01:48,208 --> 02:01:51,083
Never settle for consolation prize.

2116
02:01:51,583 --> 02:01:55,583
But who were you putting up this charade for. For me?

2117
02:01:56,083 --> 02:01:57,791
Have you heard those announcements in airplanes?

2118
02:01:58,291 --> 02:02:01,458
"Please fasten your seatbelts before helping others."

2119
02:02:01,958 --> 02:02:03,791
You look after yourself and your wife.

2120
02:02:04,291 --> 02:02:05,916
Don't worry about me!

2121
02:02:06,416 --> 02:02:07,583
I didn't want a wedding like this.

2122
02:02:08,083 --> 02:02:09,416
Look at everyone's faces.

2123
02:02:09,916 --> 02:02:13,416
No one's happy. Not even me.

2124
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:25,916
Thank you.

2125
02:02:26,416 --> 02:02:27,916
I'll send you the bill.

2126
02:02:28,416 --> 02:02:30,083
Just pay that.

2127
02:02:30,583 --> 02:02:34,083
Thank you.

2128
02:03:20,791 --> 02:03:25,291
Datto, will you never get married.

2129
02:03:25,791 --> 02:03:28,500
Tell me. - Will you never get married again?

2130
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:29,125
Datto..

2131
02:03:29,625 --> 02:03:31,375
Manoj Sharma, how are you getting this girl everytime?

2132
02:03:31,875 --> 02:03:34,708
Why did you give birth to him?

2133
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:36,541
In my next life, I'll be born as your son.

2134
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:39,916
And I swear I'll sell your home..

2135
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,291
..and make you two rot in the old-age home..

2136
02:03:42,791 --> 02:03:45,000
..or my name isn't Advocate Arun Kumar Singh.

2137
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:46,041
Lord..

2138
02:03:46,541 --> 02:03:47,541
Tell me. - Shut up!

2139
02:03:48,041 --> 02:03:52,625
I...Rampur Session Judge, Rajesh Kumar Singh's son..

2140
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:56,083
Today in this gathering..

2141
02:03:56,583 --> 02:03:58,625
Who is he? - God knows who he is.

2142
02:03:59,125 --> 02:04:00,875
Their marriage won't last for two days.

2143
02:04:01,375 --> 02:04:02,791
They will be ruined

2144
02:04:03,291 --> 02:04:04,875
..you will feed on each other's flesh.

2145
02:04:05,375 --> 02:04:09,875
Hey boy...stop this.

2146
02:04:10,375 --> 02:04:10,958
Yes, sister.

2147
02:04:11,458 --> 02:04:13,000
Look there.

2148
02:04:13,500 --> 02:04:17,625
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

2149
02:04:18,125 --> 02:04:21,083
Cannot eat.

2150
02:04:21,583 --> 02:04:25,083
Had some 'Dahi-vada'.

2151
02:04:30,083 --> 02:04:30,250
Disgusting,

2152
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:34,625
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

2153
02:04:35,125 --> 02:04:40,958
"Sweetheart...your swagger.."

2154
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:47,250
If you go looking for a 3rd one, will she be like her too?

2155
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:51,833
That's enough, all my desires are fulfilled now.

2156
02:04:52,333 --> 02:04:57,125
I thought there will be a 3rd time.

2157
02:04:57,625 --> 02:05:03,208
The other day you said you didn't miss me at all.

2158
02:05:03,708 --> 02:05:07,208
What do you think?

2159
02:05:10,208 --> 02:05:15,708
Isn't this the same tie I gifted you on your 40th birthday?

2160
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:19,708
Why did you wear it today?

2161
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:22,458
It was matching.

2162
02:05:22,958 --> 02:05:23,833
Matching..

2163
02:05:24,333 --> 02:05:26,958
That means you have no sentimental attachments no value for it.

2164
02:05:27,458 --> 02:05:28,833
No, I do. - Just a matching tie with your suit.

2165
02:05:29,333 --> 02:05:30,041
It's just a blue tie.

2166
02:05:30,541 --> 02:05:31,125
No..

2167
02:05:31,625 --> 02:05:37,041
So.. - It's a tie you gave me for 40th..

2168
02:05:37,541 --> 02:05:39,625
"Like a hot-air balloon she's rising up."

2169
02:05:40,125 --> 02:05:41,708
"No one can lay a hand on her."

2170
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:45,833
"The girl's shining like thunder."

2171
02:05:46,333 --> 02:05:50,583
"Issued in the interest of public interest."

2172
02:05:51,083 --> 02:05:54,791
"Now you handle this responsibility."

2173
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:57,166
"She keeps chatting..."

2174
02:05:57,666 --> 02:05:59,500
"..waves her hands around."

2175
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,458
"Never takes a backseat."

2176
02:06:03,958 --> 02:06:07,916
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

2177
02:06:08,416 --> 02:06:12,333
"Sweetheart...your swagger ..."

2178
02:06:12,833 --> 02:06:16,958
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

2179
02:06:17,458 --> 02:06:21,208
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

2180
02:06:21,708 --> 02:06:25,666
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

2181
02:06:26,166 --> 02:06:30,250
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

2182
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:34,708
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

2183
02:06:35,208 --> 02:06:39,041
"Sweetheart...your swagger looks beautiful."

2184
02:06:39,541 --> 02:06:43,875
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."

2185
02:06:44,375 --> 02:06:47,375
"Sweetheart...your swagger..."
