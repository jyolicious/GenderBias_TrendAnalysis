1
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,903
Papa, I want money.

2
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,811
For what?

3
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,575
As compensation for listening
to such a bad song!

4
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,779
Monu, I'll give you a lot of money...

5
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,444
Just listen to this next song!

6
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,311
Papa, Please stop!

7
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,473
I don't want your money.

8
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,269
Bye, Papa.

9
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,874
Is that girl in your class?

10
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:04,570
Why?

11
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,304
Don't be jealous.
I'll only marry you.

12
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:10,611
Shut up Dhruv!

13
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:15,440
You're saying shut up
because your eyeline is wrong.

14
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,837
Not bad!

15
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,004
You pervert!

16
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:52,509
Careful!

17
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:54,509
Come on lift!

18
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,771
Just a little bit further.

19
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,669
Do you guys do any work?

20
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,842
Bloody elevator is also not working!

21
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,108
Demand a Right to Information enquiry!

22
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,411
The Principal is corrupt.

23
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,535
Come on.

24
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,009
Don't keep putting it down.

25
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,974
Come on.
Let's get this over with.

26
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,213
So tell...what else happened
in college today?

27
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,474
She hung out with her boyfriend.
What else!

28
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,274
Shut up Monu!

29
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:18,241
Chill Sis!
Don't be shy in front of Mom!

30
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,275
Monu. Dhruv is not her boyfriend!

31
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,279
Can't one make a joke around here!

32
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,108
What's the problem with you two?

33
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,477
If you don't finish your homework -
the TV is not coming on.

34
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,341
Welcome. Welcome.

35
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,435
What would you like?

36
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,308
Lingerie?

37
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,644
I also have tongs (thongs).
Black laces, red laces...

38
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,577
Purple, green, fluorescent colors...

39
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:23,083
Don't worry.
You can get anything here.

40
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,044
From a needle to an aeroplane!

41
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:27,113
I can arrange anything.

42
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,807
Uncle. We don't want an aeroplane...!
- What do you want?

43
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:32,940
Do you have a vibrator?

44
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,245
Of course!

45
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,008
What model do you want?
Soft, hard, medium?

46
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,307
A phone without a
vibration unit is useless!

47
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,280
I've put my own wife on a vibrator!

48
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,041
She never hears the phone ring!

49
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:51,273
Show her a vibration unit.
What's the model number of your phone?

50
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,178
Where are you taking me?

51
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,246
Since when did you
become a Bio student?

52
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,101
What?

53
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,610
Oh my god!

54
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,438
Go...Yeah!

55
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,380
Even at this age getting cake
smeared on my birthday!

56
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,646
We should jam.

57
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,008
Yes definitely.

58
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,874
Tell me when?

59
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:35,540
You can come to my house...

60
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:37,606
Anytime.

61
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,402
What?

62
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,307
Nothing.

63
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,971
Come to your house...

64
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,010
...to jam?

65
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,774
Definitely.

66
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,410
When?

67
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,906
Anytime!

68
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,107
Hey Nima!

69
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,039
Come out dude.

70
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:15,106
One, two, three, four...go!

71
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:21,111
Just a minute.
Somethings not right.

72
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,169
Aunty. The poha's yummy.

73
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,511
Sameera, have you been playing guitar
since you were a child?

74
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,472
No Aunty.
Just the last couple of years.

75
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:37,436
Laila has been learning music
since she was seven.

76
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,474
Sameera, has Laila played you any
of her classical compositions?

77
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,375
Mom!

78
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,973
Practice!

79
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,370
Call me if you want anything.

80
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:53,510
I'm sorry.

81
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,270
Chill. All moms are like this.

82
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,110
Mom!!

83
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,472
Napkins!

84
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:09,312
Okay. Maybe we should do a song...

85
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,240
Aai, Aai, Aai...

86
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,411
Sis!

87
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,501
Let me sleep.

88
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,376
You'll take a kid's life!

89
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:38,407
Laila...

90
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,002
You're a rock star!

91
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,071
I love it.

92
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,440
Thank you.

93
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:48,436
I'll see you tomorrow.

94
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,138
Okay definitely, Laila.

95
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,541
We'll try it with
the band tomorrow.

96
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:52,805
Okay.

97
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,304
Bye.

98
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,074
Bye Laila.

99
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,112
What?

100
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,207
Trying to fob me off with an SMS.

101
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,672
No.

102
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,440
Don't you think
we should explore other...

103
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,376
Explore?

104
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,476
Am I just an experiment to you?

105
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,138
Please.

106
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,507
Forget it.

107
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,011
It's a great idea!

108
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,477
Okay.

109
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,468
Bye.

110
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:00,541
Because it sucked.

111
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,746
Yeah?
-Yeah.

112
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,337
Fuck you.

113
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,078
Oh fuck you.

114
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,242
And your stupid friends.

115
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,572
Jealous.

116
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:17,510
Being friends with “normal“ people
won't make you “normal.“

117
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,509
Asshole.

118
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,441
Coward.

119
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:54,805
Mom.

120
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,737
Shampoo.

121
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,635
I just shampooed you yesterday.

122
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,537
Please just do it Mom.

123
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:07,247
Who's going to start a fight with you
first thing in the morning!

124
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,601
Mom...

125
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,801
Nothing.

126
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,041
Tell me!

127
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,407
No.

128
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,943
Okay. Don't tell.
You'll get a tummy ache!

129
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,641
Mom.

130
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:48,007
I like this boy.

131
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:52,778
He's also into music...

132
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:57,911
Mom!

133
00:20:58,733 --> 00:20:59,711
Did you hear?

134
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,769
Yes. That's great.

135
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:35,677
Hi.

136
00:21:36,933 --> 00:21:38,276
You want a book?

137
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,906
No.

138
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,112
Nima. I have something for you.

139
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,741
Sorry.

140
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,505
What is it? Give it to me.

141
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:05,605
Later.

142
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,904
Shhh.

143
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,670
What a competition!

144
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,070
It was too close.

145
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,010
Okay without delay.

146
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:59,178
The winners are...

147
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,677
...Ramjas College!

148
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,846
This competition is a milestone.

149
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,741
It's not just about music.

150
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:26,845
When we heard that the lyricist was
a disabled girl...

151
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,012
...we had to give
the award to her college.

152
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,335
Your journey...

153
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:40,073
...must have been very difficult
compared to that of a normal musician...

154
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:42,340
Will you share something with us?

155
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:58,113
It's okay. What can you
expect from those fuckers?

156
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,141
Laila, this is Tribe's best song.

157
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:06,306
Maybe Subbu's song was better.

158
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,974
Trust me Laila. You did a great job.

159
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:14,507
We totally deserved to win. Okay?

160
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,678
When you're there
everything's okay.

161
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:23,078
The entire bands here for you.

162
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,339
No Nima.

163
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,211
You.

164
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:34,971
Just you.

165
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,337
Everyone's waiting for us.
Come.

166
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,141
Yeah.

167
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,979
I'll just come.

168
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:29,707
Careful!

169
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:35,242
When was the last check up?

170
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,041
Six months ago.

171
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:40,737
Hopeless!

172
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,303
Excuse me?
- Sorry, I wasn't talking to you.

173
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:45,844
Completely ignorant.

174
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,571
Just blabbering nonsense.

175
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,513
As soon as Laila gets admission
to any foreign university...

176
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,911
...I'll personally phone
her and tell her...

177
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:55,947
...who's normal and
who needs brain surgery!

178
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,871
Why do you jump to foreign
universities at the drop of a hat?

179
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:23,211
I made a fool of myself.

180
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:26,273
It was not just your song.

181
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:31,846
He doesn't love me Mom.

182
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,380
I can't bear going
to this college anymore.

183
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,401
Come outside.

184
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:30,737
Why?

185
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,272
Just come.

186
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,343
Mom!

187
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,777
Papa!

188
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,174
Only your mother.
I don't support this.

189
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:00,971
Why?

190
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:04,007
What happened in Delhi
University is over.

191
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,375
To go so far away to America...

192
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,204
...it doesn't sit well with me.

193
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,011
And Delhi has other options.

194
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,104
Mom?

195
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,775
Do you want to go?

196
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,208
Don't look there.

197
00:31:21,434 --> 00:31:23,072
You want to go right?

198
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:31,437
Of course.

199
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,878
You don't come.
The two of us are definitely going!

200
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,972
Please Papa.

201
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,338
It's one pound over.

202
00:31:56,634 --> 00:31:57,738
That's okay.

203
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:01,380
With great difficulty I've squeezed
one month's clothing into two suitcases!

204
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,846
Anyway they're not going to charge me
for being one pound overweight!

205
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,179
If they make you repack at the airport -
don't say I didn't warn you!

206
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,138
If you have such a glum face
they'll definitely open them!

207
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,010
One minute.
I'll just be back.

208
00:33:35,033 --> 00:33:39,277
Hello Shubhangani. How are you?

209
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,972
Are you done with packing?
-Yes.

210
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,269
Hi Dhruv.
-Hi

211
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:46,346
This is for you.
-Oh thank you.

212
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:46,968
Come inside.

213
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:47,943
Hi.

214
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,241
You were leaving without saying bye?

215
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,804
Bitch!

216
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,246
Rook to H5.

217
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:48,645
Hey!

218
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,537
Sorry.

219
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,576
It's okay you can watch.
Just keep your trap shut!

220
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,611
Yeah.

221
00:35:07,167 --> 00:35:09,545
Put it on manual...

222
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,339
it's stuck!

223
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,544
I'm going to tell you right up...
I don't do bottoms!

224
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,977
Excuse me?

225
00:35:35,034 --> 00:35:37,036
I've had some Indian kids before...

226
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,508
You've got to wipe your own ass honey...

227
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:39,978
I'll just pour the water!

228
00:35:42,634 --> 00:35:45,979
I was just wondering,
if you have any experience with...

229
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,013
...someone with cerebral palsy?

230
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:51,810
I hope you understand, it is just
the motor skills that are affected...

231
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,642
...and not the intelligence...

232
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,647
I'm quite aware of what
cerebral palsy is actually.

233
00:35:56,734 --> 00:35:59,214
You don't have to worry at all...
Mrs. Kapoor?

234
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,247
Kapoor pronounced cup not cap.

235
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,072
Cup.

236
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,007
Take this.

237
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,275
Be home by 4.

238
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:17,712
Or I'll call the cops!

239
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,314
Don't worry Aai.

240
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:23,105
Bye.

241
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,440
Bye.

242
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,874
Hey. How're you doing?

243
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:41,809
Hi.

244
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,208
Come on back.

245
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,906
I have a place all
set up for you on the left.

246
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,870
Where you headed?

247
00:36:49,967 --> 00:36:51,674
Union Square.

248
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,175
Say that again please.

249
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:54,975
Union Square!

250
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:57,776
Okay, okay Union Square.
You got it.

251
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,780
Write from your heart...
Write from your eyes...

252
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:11,813
Write from your liver!

253
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,780
Okay. So what we're going to do
is have an assignment...

254
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:17,677
...in which you're going to write
from all your senses. Okay?

255
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:19,543
I'm gonna give you the parameters...

256
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,603
You're going to write a story...
a poem...

257
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:24,570
...rap Song--

258
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,237
Okay so write these down.

259
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:29,142
It is...

260
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,672
<i>...New Year's Eve.</i>

261
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,070
You're on a boat.

262
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:37,038
You hear the sound of a cello.

263
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:40,576
You taste an orange.

264
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,705
Someone is wearing blue.

265
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,577
And you tell a loved one...

266
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,844
...a very personal secret.

267
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:55,377
No hiding!

268
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,612
All right you have ten minutes. Go!

269
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,472
Hello Laila.
- Hi.

270
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,342
So welcome to the
Creative Writing program.

271
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,913
I'm so glad you could be here with us.

272
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:14,345
Thank you, Professor.

273
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,012
It's Jose. it's just Jose.

274
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,235
Okay Jose.

275
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,277
Listen. Would you like me
to assign a writer to you?

276
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,744
In fact I've already talked
to somebody.

277
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,871
Actually I can type...

278
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:28,812
I am sorry what did you say?

279
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,645
That would be wonderful!

280
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,978
Yeah.

281
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:50,073
You know...

282
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,307
I have an aunt in Birmingham.

283
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:55,444
I wish I had an aunt in India!

284
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,507
You know I really want to go there.

285
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,941
My dream place is Varanasi.

286
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:01,639
How come?

287
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:03,676
My step dad's guru is from there.

288
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:05,509
He came to visit us one time.

289
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,576
He emanated such peace.

290
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,438
It's anything but peaceful!

291
00:39:12,334 --> 00:39:13,176
Really?

292
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:17,545
You could stay with us
if you come to India.

293
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:19,675
Are you serious?

294
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,111
That would be absolutely amazing.

295
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:30,309
Listen...Laila, I should probably go.

296
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:34,345
Yeah. You have to...
I have to go too.

297
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,277
But I'll see you soon okay?

298
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,771
Bye.

299
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:41,470
Bye Laila.

300
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:48,908
We'll go home now and cut your nails.
They've grown too long.

301
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,975
I'm going now to check out the clubs.

302
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:54,275
Clubs?
-Student clubs.

303
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,678
You've missed a whole semester.

304
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,577
Let's go home now and study.

305
00:39:58,634 --> 00:40:03,014
Mom. I know when I need to study!

306
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:17,507
Sixteen-year-old Ronnie Martin
was killed by the NYPD.

307
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:19,676
For only one reason.

308
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,709
He was black.

309
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,811
Fuck the police!

310
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:47,038
Fuck the police!

311
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:48,513
These cops are even more dangerous
than the Delhi police!

312
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,177
This is nothing.

313
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,376
Are you from India?

314
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:01,180
You think all “desis“ are from India.

315
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,805
I didn't mean...
l...I'm sorry...

316
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,807
My mother is from Pakistan.

317
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:13,344
And my father from Bangladesh.

318
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:17,510
I've lived in seven countries,
including Madagascar!

319
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,774
Wow.

320
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,041
It's actually quite cool.
That you came out for this.

321
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,606
Usually Indians don't.

322
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,208
I'm Laila.

323
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,102
Khanum.

324
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,135
I'll see you tonight.

325
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,645
Yeah. Cool.

326
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:00,904
Mom.

327
00:43:13,434 --> 00:43:14,742
Khanum.

328
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,303
This is Aai, my Mom.

329
00:43:17,367 --> 00:43:18,744
Hello Mom.

330
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,874
Hello.

331
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,644
Lailu, why don't you
invite your friend over?

332
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,175
Khanum, come for dinner.

333
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:28,111
Mom I'd love to.
But I have a paper due tomorrow.

334
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:30,404
Come over anytime before I leave.

335
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,342
Definitely.

336
00:43:31,634 --> 00:43:32,612
Bye Laila.

337
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:33,805
Bye.

338
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:37,342
This way.

339
00:43:38,267 --> 00:43:39,473
Thank you.

340
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,245
Let's go.

341
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,845
Mom.

342
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:28,510
Hey. How's it going?

343
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,304
Good.

344
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,874
I'm sorry I'm late.

345
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:33,538
I got held up at lunch.

346
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:36,879
So. Do you wanna get started?

347
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:37,776
Yeah.

348
00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:38,902
Okay.

349
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,873
Have you chosen a topic
for the assignment?

350
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:47,616
I want to talk about
my first relationship.

351
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:49,638
Yeah.

352
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,701
Yeah.

353
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,008
There's this guy Nima...

354
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,877
When I fell in love with him...

355
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,902
...it was like...

356
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,207
...electricity...you know!

357
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:08,674
Yeah, yeah. I do know yeah.

358
00:45:08,734 --> 00:45:10,042
Yeah.

359
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,906
And the first time he...

360
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,879
...touched me...

361
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,442
You mean you've had sex?

362
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:26,642
Was that your...girlfriend?

363
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:28,571
Who?

364
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:32,677
The girl you were lip locked
with just now.

365
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,602
No. No. She's just a friend.

366
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:39,873
Wow.

367
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:43,311
Is kissing in India a big deal?

368
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:48,709
Well you don't smooch your friends,
that's for sure!

369
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,576
Oh so if I kiss you
I'd have to marry you then?

370
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,404
No.

371
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:31,242
Hello.

372
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,571
Hi, It's Laila.

373
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,649
I was just wondering
what you are up to?

374
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,715
Yeah that would be great.

375
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,140
Okay.

376
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:52,606
Bye.

377
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,970
Come inside.

378
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,702
I'm looking for Miles Davis...

379
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,007
“Speeches of Spain?

380
00:47:14,467 --> 00:47:16,674
Okay, we should have that.
Give me one second.

381
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,276
May I help you Miss?

382
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:20,779
I'm okay.

383
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:22,644
Where are you from?

384
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,145
India.

385
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:26,706
Wow! Let me show you something
I think you'll really like.

386
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,379
WOW!

387
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,676
How much is it?

388
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:45,341
Well I can give you 10% off...
so that would make it only 749 dollars...

389
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,640
...which is a really good deal!

390
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,646
<i>I wish...</i>

391
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,881
I'm on a scholarship.

392
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,476
Let me go talk to my manager
and I'll see what I can do for you.

393
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:56,810
Ask him for...

394
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:59,575
...50% off!

395
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,043
I don't know if I can do 50%.
But I like you. So I'll see what I can do!

396
00:48:03,134 --> 00:48:04,272
Yeah.

397
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:22,006
This is my secret haunts.

398
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:36,777
Close your eyes you will see better.

399
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:46,877
These are the three concentric circles.

400
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,737
This is a depiction of the world.

401
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,479
It is encircled by a beautiful
naked figure of a woman...

402
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:02,273
...the sky goddess Nut.

403
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,304
Whose body is bent protectively
over the world.

404
00:49:10,434 --> 00:49:12,004
Relax!

405
00:49:12,434 --> 00:49:14,675
Until now only you have seen me.

406
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,411
Let me see you too.

407
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:40,042
Bitch!

408
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:41,272
What?

409
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:44,578
Dude you are so pretty.

410
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,373
So pretty that I feel like cursing you!

411
00:50:14,967 --> 00:50:17,174
I didn't know you play chess?

412
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,271
Check.

413
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,379
You're next to get beaten.

414
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,643
Just like everybody else out here!

415
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,641
Your turn.

416
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,977
You're too much! You are too much!

417
00:50:41,334 --> 00:50:44,645
Pass my costume.

418
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,373
Come let's get you changed.

419
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:39,244
Ballu.

420
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,646
There's such amazing snowfall here.

421
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,273
And the room cozy and warm
with central heating.

422
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,610
Remember I told you about Khanum?

423
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:55,542
She's a very helpful girl.

424
00:51:55,867 --> 00:51:59,076
Tonight Lailu's going for a study
sleep over at her house.

425
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,038
Hi. What can I get you?

426
00:52:10,134 --> 00:52:11,636
Can I have a house white please?

427
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,701
Sure.

428
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:15,837
A coke.

429
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,506
What?

430
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,012
You think this is McDonalds?

431
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,208
Have a drink!

432
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:22,611
I've never had one...

433
00:52:23,034 --> 00:52:24,411
Why don't you look at our cocktail list?

434
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:26,743
Our Pina Coladas are really popular.

435
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,305
We have Sex on the Beach, Mojitos,
Manhattans... Anything you like.

436
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,236
Can I have a...

437
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,870
Margarita?

438
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,938
With a straw.

439
00:52:40,167 --> 00:52:43,011
Great choice. Okay, coming right up!

440
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,879
Have you ever dated?

441
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:50,844
Why would anyone date me?

442
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,779
Why do you put yourself down
all the time?

443
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:55,876
Let me do it for you!

444
00:52:57,567 --> 00:53:00,878
Because that has been my experience.

445
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:03,842
For the last time...

446
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,471
You are very beautiful.

447
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:14,476
Okay! One white wine and
a Margarita, with a straw, for you.

448
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,602
Thank you.

449
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:16,771
You 're very welcome.

450
00:54:58,467 --> 00:54:59,878
Thank you.

451
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,912
Can I get you some wine?

452
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:11,371
No. I have a headache.

453
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:19,047
You need one exotic head massage.

454
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,443
And by mistake if I strangle you,

455
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:25,440
forgive my blindness!

456
00:59:02,967 --> 00:59:05,379
Lailu! Thats enough time in the bath!

457
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:09,641
Mom!

458
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,546
There's no end to the hot water here!

459
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:27,004
Will you come out?

460
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:28,645
Why?

461
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:43,379
Where's your gold chain?

462
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,404
It must have fallen off.

463
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:52,038
It had such a strong clasp.
How can it just fall off?

464
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,304
It's not in the bathroom either.

465
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:00,970
The caregiver must have taken it!

466
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:04,813
We trust these people
and they take advantage.

467
01:00:05,834 --> 01:00:08,610
I'm going to phone her right now. Maybe
that's why she didn't come to work today.

468
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:09,839
Mom...

469
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:12,378
No Lailu.
It can only be her.

470
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,242
I pawned it!

471
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,043
What?

472
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,210
I bought an IPad.

473
01:00:20,934 --> 01:00:22,572
It's really cool.

474
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:26,479
It even has a voice activator.

475
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:28,905
It was your grandmother's chain!

476
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:32,940
What's happened to you Lailu?

477
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:38,139
But I wanted it for my studies...

478
01:00:38,767 --> 01:00:42,078
Studies?
Surfing porn sites is studying?!

479
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,641
You should be ashamed of yourself.

480
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,272
How dare you?

481
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,847
This is my privacy.

482
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:56,077
Privacy? You want privacy from me?!
I'll slap you if you talk to me like that.

483
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:46,903
Move in with me.

484
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:52,005
And what should I tell my parents?

485
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:55,639
Even in their wildest dreams
they wouldn't guess that we're lovers!

486
01:02:28,634 --> 01:02:32,810
I will miss you Mom.

487
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:57,810
Bye.
- Bye.

488
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,941
Oh fuck!

489
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:09,404
Keep the place.

490
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,205
The University pays for it anyway.

491
01:04:13,334 --> 01:04:17,578
Always have a place of your own, so no
motherfucker can put you on the street.

492
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:22,075
Give me the address.
I'll go there tomorrow morning.

493
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:26,042
Oh ifs okay.
Khanum can take care of me.

494
01:04:26,334 --> 01:04:31,340
That's a big no no. People don't like
to be carers and lovers at the same time.

495
01:04:35,367 --> 01:04:36,778
Besides...

496
01:04:37,467 --> 01:04:39,276
That would put me out of work.

497
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:51,079
You can stay here while I'm gone...
if you like.

498
01:05:28,767 --> 01:05:32,544
After all this renovation you better not
break up with me for at least 2 years!

499
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,774
Do you want lip gloss?

500
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:49,835
Yes.

501
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,374
Lailu. Come home in
the summer break.

502
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,974
Did you just win the lottery?

503
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:55,809
I still haven't repaid the
debt of your outgoing flight...

504
01:07:55,867 --> 01:07:57,813
...so might as well add the cost of
another flight to it!

505
01:07:57,867 --> 01:08:00,370
Happy Holi Papa.

506
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:01,644
Hello Mom.

507
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,179
How are you Khanum?

508
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:05,210
I'm good. Thanks.

509
01:08:06,634 --> 01:08:09,114
Why don't you also
come to India with Laila?

510
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:13,271
I really want to come Mom.
But Laila never invites me!

511
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:14,476
What happened?

512
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:17,173
Nothing.
I'll definitely come now!

513
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:20,104
Just pray to Allah that I get my visa.

514
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:21,943
You must come.

515
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:23,069
Yes.

516
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:26,813
Where's Monu?

517
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:28,346
In the bathroom. As always!

518
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,611
Here you go. Your receipt's in the bag.

519
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:31,871
Thank you.

520
01:08:31,934 --> 01:08:32,969
You're welcome.

521
01:08:44,734 --> 01:08:46,645
Don't move anything around.

522
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:01,446
When did you figure out...

523
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:03,102
that..

524
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:04,077
You know..

525
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,804
...you're gay?

526
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,514
Your body is perfect.

527
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,574
You could be a model.

528
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,547
Have you ever seen a model who's blind?

529
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:38,275
I've known I'm gay
since I was fourteen.

530
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:41,407
Wow.

531
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:46,213
I wish I could be that certain.

532
01:09:52,434 --> 01:09:54,539
You know I was okay
with the realisation.

533
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:01,040
But the main problem
was parents and relatives.

534
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,981
You have to lie all the time. And then
spend hours feeling guilty about lying.

535
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:07,778
Just wasn't my thing.

536
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,938
So I told them.

537
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:12,072
Then? What happened?

538
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,536
My mother kissed me...

539
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,410
...and hugged me!

540
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:18,844
No way!

541
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,902
Of course not.

542
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,012
There was a full scale drama!

543
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,107
First there were slaps...

544
01:10:26,034 --> 01:10:27,604
...then emotional blackmail...

545
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,908
<i>...counseling...</i>

546
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:31,640
...howling...weeping.

547
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:34,008
Then?

548
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,306
My mother took me to a doctor...

549
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,844
As if I had some disease
that could be cured.

550
01:10:46,234 --> 01:10:48,009
Oh god.

551
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:51,407
When all her efforts failed
she finally

552
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:55,544
...stopped talking to me.

553
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,773
Is she still angry with you?

554
01:11:00,134 --> 01:11:02,375
Last week after
she'd had a fight with my Dad...

555
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,943
...she phoned me and said...

556
01:11:05,701 --> 01:11:09,672
“Thank God you will never ever have to
deal with men!“

557
01:11:09,734 --> 01:11:14,183
My parents would have a heart attack!

558
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,910
For me I just like to be
who I am all the time.

559
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:26,441
This is scary for me.

560
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,111
It's wonderful...

561
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:35,006
...but so scary.

562
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:36,143
It's tipping down with rain!

563
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,274
You can do some
work too you know!

564
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,340
No. Now that I know you can type so well...
and were conning me all this while...!

565
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,843
It's because I...

566
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:57,347
...I thought you were cute!

567
01:12:57,967 --> 01:12:59,503
So you don't think I'm cute any more?

568
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:05,405
Now I have a...

569
01:13:07,267 --> 01:13:09,543
...I'm with someone.

570
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:11,639
30?

571
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,804
Can I use your bathroom?

572
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:24,443
Yeah, ifs just on the left.

573
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:29,038
Oh. I should help you.

574
01:13:32,034 --> 01:13:33,411
Okay.

575
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,639
Okay. I'm done.

576
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,312
Can I straighten your leg?

577
01:14:58,367 --> 01:14:59,607
Yeah.

578
01:15:07,634 --> 01:15:09,170
Just relax okay?

579
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:11,543
I'm feeling shit scared.

580
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:14,547
Scared? Don't worry.

581
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:16,439
Yeah.

582
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:23,804
I have bad news for you.

583
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:26,646
What?

584
01:16:38,134 --> 01:16:40,410
The Indian government
has denied my visa.

585
01:16:50,667 --> 01:16:52,613
I've got the visa and the ticket!

586
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:57,547
Here Comes the Bride.....

587
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:52,937
Maharashtrian eggplant!

588
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,910
Again?

589
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:55,010
So what?

590
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:56,611
Nothing.

591
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,441
No. Go ahead.
Just say it!

592
01:17:59,734 --> 01:18:01,111
What should I say?

593
01:18:01,701 --> 01:18:04,204
It might even be possible
to see a lion eating grass...

594
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,577
But to see a Punjabi
eating this stuff everyday...!

595
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:10,979
Can't show my face in the community!

596
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:13,173
So you should have
married that Punjabi girl...

597
01:18:13,267 --> 01:18:14,575
Can't remember her name.

598
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:15,802
Harneet.

599
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,772
Yes. Harneet!

600
01:18:18,934 --> 01:18:21,574
She could make you
your roti and butter chicken!

601
01:18:22,167 --> 01:18:24,647
Khanum my child.
Tell me - what's wrong with this?

602
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:26,441
It's really yummy.

603
01:18:26,834 --> 01:18:27,778
Heard?

604
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:28,639
Did you hear?

605
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,610
Yes. I heard.

606
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:32,340
You should have made something else.

607
01:18:47,834 --> 01:18:49,142
Are you sure?

608
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,203
Yes. She is.

609
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:56,212
That's great.

610
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:58,370
Evolved choice.

611
01:19:01,634 --> 01:19:03,079
How will you have kids?

612
01:19:04,601 --> 01:19:06,376
Get with the century, dude!

613
01:19:07,767 --> 01:19:11,579
If Aunty finds out - there'll not just be
bomb blasts but serial blasts!

614
01:19:13,267 --> 01:19:15,008
Mom's not like that at all!

615
01:19:15,534 --> 01:19:17,775
I've known Aunty for 540 years!

616
01:19:20,734 --> 01:19:22,270
Don't under estimate her.

617
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,909
Mom is a 'rockstar'

618
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:28,680
She is way ahead of my own ammi.

619
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,073
And I came out to her.

620
01:19:57,967 --> 01:20:00,208
Mom. I'm Bi.

621
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,779
Am I any less of a maid (Bai)?

622
01:20:03,267 --> 01:20:04,302
What?!

623
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:09,640
No matter how educated Indian men are,
at some level women are just maids!

624
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,737
Look at your own father.

625
01:20:11,834 --> 01:20:14,872
Come what may -
he just wants my cooking.

626
01:20:15,434 --> 01:20:19,473
They should be lined up
and made to wash clothes!

627
01:20:19,567 --> 01:20:22,411
Really Lailu.
I'm not joking.

628
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:25,045
I know!

629
01:20:29,667 --> 01:20:30,702
Mom!

630
01:20:34,634 --> 01:20:36,272
I love you, Mom.

631
01:20:36,867 --> 01:20:38,312
Love you too.

632
01:22:46,734 --> 01:22:48,042
Mom...

633
01:22:48,467 --> 01:22:54,850
You look like a heroine
with your short hair.

634
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:16,073
You know that thing I was
saying about being Bi...

635
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:19,774
Now you're well and truly a maid.
Because of me.

636
01:23:21,467 --> 01:23:22,605
Give.

637
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,813
I meant...

638
01:23:29,434 --> 01:23:31,380
Bisexual.

639
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:34,038
Bi...what?

640
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,240
What does it mean?

641
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,711
I love Khanum, Mom.

642
01:23:45,934 --> 01:23:49,780
Yes. We all love her.
She's so nice.

643
01:23:51,534 --> 01:23:55,846
Khanum's my girlfriend!

644
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,270
Yuck.

645
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,743
Not done Mom.
You're being a hypocrite.

646
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:35,474
Who's put this in your head?
There's nothing hypocritical here.

647
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:42,112
Of course there is!

648
01:24:42,501 --> 01:24:45,243
Don't argue Laila.
This isn't normal.

649
01:24:50,734 --> 01:24:54,705
That's what the world said
about me too.

650
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,812
What's your problem now?

651
01:25:22,334 --> 01:25:23,745
Ask!

652
01:25:23,934 --> 01:25:25,072
You ask.

653
01:25:25,134 --> 01:25:26,442
No. You.

654
01:25:30,467 --> 01:25:32,640
Monu's insisting on being taken
to the cricket match!

655
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:36,141
If we don't buy the tickets today
there'll be none left.

656
01:25:36,467 --> 01:25:38,674
Ask your mother.
What can I say!

657
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,310
Mom. Please!

658
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:42,040
I've even finished studying.

659
01:25:42,134 --> 01:25:44,341
This is Khanum's first trip to India...

660
01:25:44,534 --> 01:25:48,311
How can we let her go
without watching a cricket match!

661
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:49,835
Mom!

662
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,239
Papa. Now you handle it!

663
01:25:56,301 --> 01:25:58,178
What can I do!

664
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,609
Monu. Play gently.

665
01:26:08,967 --> 01:26:10,105
Play-

666
01:26:13,467 --> 01:26:15,105
Go Khanum!
-Play.

667
01:26:43,234 --> 01:26:45,271
Where's Mom?

668
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:48,946
She's inside.
The doctor said we can see her soon.

669
01:26:49,434 --> 01:26:52,313
Why has she been admitted?

670
01:26:57,567 --> 01:27:01,276
Your mother has colon cancer.
Second stage. Relapse.

671
01:27:08,867 --> 01:27:11,211
Your mother's a fighter.

672
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:14,007
She will definitely beat it.

673
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,607
One of you has to wait outside.

674
01:27:29,834 --> 01:27:30,835
Okay.

675
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,945
Sorry.

676
01:28:09,901 --> 01:28:11,676
Nothing will happen.

677
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:18,872
Go back to America.

678
01:28:28,867 --> 01:28:30,778
How's Khanum?

679
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:30,839
Okay?
-Yeah.

680
01:29:44,567 --> 01:29:47,514
I'm sorry Khanum.

681
01:29:50,234 --> 01:29:52,510
You're not coming back
to New York right?

682
01:29:52,734 --> 01:29:55,977
I am. Definitely.

683
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,747
One day...in New York

684
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:11,072
At Jared's house...

685
01:30:12,567 --> 01:30:15,275
While we were working...

686
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:20,543
I had sex with him.

687
01:30:24,267 --> 01:30:26,144
What do you mean?

688
01:30:28,767 --> 01:30:30,610
When we were together?

689
01:30:32,067 --> 01:30:33,808
Once.

690
01:30:35,867 --> 01:30:37,471
How could you?

691
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:44,878
I wasn't thinking.

692
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:56,410
I was confused...
I know what I did was wrong.

693
01:30:57,867 --> 01:31:00,746
So by fucking you, Jared
gave you a certificate of “normalcy”?

694
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,972
No.

695
01:31:04,934 --> 01:31:08,040
It happened in the moment.
-How convenient .

696
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:17,944
Jared could see me.

697
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,111
That's why.

698
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,479
You used me!

699
01:32:47,367 --> 01:32:49,404
To take care of you...

700
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:52,840
...Fill your loneliness.

701
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:09,177
So I was a stopgap till
you could find a boyfriend right?

702
01:33:09,267 --> 01:33:14,080
No Khanum.
That's not fair.

703
01:33:14,967 --> 01:33:18,813
After doing all this you have the
fucking balls to call me unfair?

704
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:27,078
You should have told me then
and finished it off.

705
01:33:27,934 --> 01:33:30,278
Why carry on a Charade all this while?

706
01:33:33,434 --> 01:33:36,745
I didn't want to lose you.

707
01:33:42,234 --> 01:33:43,713
Now what?

708
01:33:45,167 --> 01:33:47,647
You think I won't leave because of Mom.

709
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:53,975
I don't want secrets anymore.

710
01:34:32,034 --> 01:34:33,513
Laila...

711
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:34,637
What?

712
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:36,509
Lailu. My feet are feeling cold.

713
01:34:37,101 --> 01:34:41,345
Nurse. Can we get
some woollen socks please?

714
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:43,510
The blanket should suffice.

715
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:47,978
Nurse. Socks! Now!

716
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,507
One minute, Mom.

717
01:35:13,534 --> 01:35:16,606
No. Just let it be for a little longer.

718
01:35:18,834 --> 01:35:20,108
Please.

719
01:35:33,934 --> 01:35:36,005
Good girl, Mom.

720
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,841
I'm sorry. She is gone.

721
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,470
Papa. Can you play this for Mom?

722
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:17,912
Laila, my child,
let the rituals be over first.

723
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:21,443
Monu, get the CD.

724
01:39:44,634 --> 01:39:46,739
Panditji, one moment please.

725
01:41:42,067 --> 01:41:43,876
Was it really necessary to tell me?

726
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:50,909
Yes.

727
01:41:57,367 --> 01:42:00,814
Khanum, Laila, hurry up!
Its getting late to go to the airport.

728
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:55,075
Your straight hair is great.

729
01:43:55,300 --> 01:44:00,374
Tony, please try
something different today.

730
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:02,175
Of course!

731
01:44:06,467 --> 01:44:08,174
Hi.
-Hi.

732
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:11,876
Hey listen. We're going for a movie.
Do you want to come?

733
01:44:12,467 --> 01:44:14,606
Some other time.

734
01:44:15,034 --> 01:44:16,479
Why?

735
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,579
I have a date.

736
01:44:20,467 --> 01:44:22,538
Helloooo! With who?

737
01:44:44,634 --> 01:44:46,136
Come

738
01:44:59,067 --> 01:45:00,512
