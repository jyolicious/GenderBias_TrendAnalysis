1
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:03,993
Satyakam's story is all about truth,
love, conscience and fearlessness

2
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:09,360
Satyakam, the character in our
ancient texts, The Upanishads...

3
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:15,367
Approaches Goutam the Guru,
seeking to be his disciple

4
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,803
The Guru asks him,
to which family do you belong?

5
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,204
Satyakam says,
I asked my Mother

6
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,846
My Mother has told me that she has
served many before she begot me

7
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,587
She says, I do not know your
father's name. But I am Jabala

8
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,920
So your name is Satyakam,
the son of Jabala

9
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,090
The sage embraced Satyakam,
and he said...

10
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,433
"You are the true Brahmin,
enlightened because..."

11
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,099
"you have the courage
to speak the truth"

12
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,604
That story was told ages ago.
Now, listen to our story

13
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,477
Many years ago, a young man
set out in quest of God

14
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:59,477
When he reached the foothills of the
sacred Himalayas, he heard a command

15
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,954
"Upon the path for the quest of truth
you shall find God"

16
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,283
Young Satyanarayan Acharya
settled down in...

17
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:15,623
A village named Saptaparni, to spread
this word. Here, he set up school

18
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,832
Our story is about this family
of Acharyas

19
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,837
Every heir of the family carried
the name Satya (Truth)

20
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:32,673
Theirs was a creed founded in principle
and practice on the quest for truth

21
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,284
Not even in their dreams would
they stray from the truth

22
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:42,683
And no insult for them could be worse,
than being blamed of having lied

23
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:48,294
One of them Satyapriya,
used to be my class-mate

24
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,095
His mother died in childbirth

25
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:57,505
His father renounced the worldly life
and went away to become a monk

26
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:06,279
Grandfather Satyasaran brought up
the orphan lovingly, caringly

27
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,646
I met Satyapriya in
Engineering College

28
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,485
Gradually, I developed
a liking for him

29
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,490
At the hostel, we shared the same room
...and the same dreams

30
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,491
Satyapriya goes back to those days...

31
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:29,001
In 1946... our country
was still enslaved

32
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,540
Our exams over, we were waiting for
our results. On our last day...

33
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,572
Prof Sen was making
the valedictory speech in the college

34
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,119
You are going to become engineers

35
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:47,754
Your education, your skills,
aren't merely for making a living

36
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,561
I hope you will use it
as a way of life

37
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,932
In college, you have seen
the Bucker machine

38
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,898
You have seen how the machine
how the machine splices steel

39
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:12,540
Many a times you will feel
that life is a BUCKER machine...

40
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,545
And you are the steel being spliced.
- Excuse me silt..

41
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,884
Man is not steel. Man is many more
times stronger than steel

42
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,096
I pray to God that you will be able
to prove that

43
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:32,900
This courage, this confidence is
the greatest wealth of a free nation

44
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:38,201
And I am certain that our country
will soon be liberated

45
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:43,206
Will we really get our independence?
- Who can stop us now?

46
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,412
Look around you. The fires of
the revolution are spreading

47
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:50,016
The Netaji's Indian National Army,
and now the mutiny in the Royal Navy

48
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,017
Didn't you read the newspapers?
The Air Force has come out in support

49
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:59,187
What are you thinking?
- Naren, we are truly fortunate...

50
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,897
To have been born in such times.
Hunger, unemployment, the black market

51
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,227
It is all coming to an end. The future
belongs to hard work and honesty

52
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,034
I'm moved to tears at the joy of it

53
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,311
I'm going to take up education.
I'll become a professor

54
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,810
You fellows will pass.
I'm on the endless vigil

55
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,649
Naren, whom are you writing to?
- My mother

56
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:33,028
Send her my greetings.
- Sure. Yes, there's a letter for you

57
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,298
Grandpa?
- Yes. I had written to him asking...

58
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,038
What I should do after graduation.
This must be his reply

59
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,103
So what does he say?

60
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:50,671
"My blessings be with you.
You want to know what you should do?"

61
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,681
"I reply, I will tell you this canto
from The Gita"

62
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,954
"Only to work, yours is the right
Not the fruit"

63
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,288
"Be free, stay pure, and dedicate
yourself to your work"

64
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,631
"This is my blessing for you"

65
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:12,426
I'd really like to meet your grandpa.
- Come along

66
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,303
Living in a gurukul (school)
Is an experience in itself

67
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,437
Over there, it's as if,
time has come to a stop

68
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:23,941
And the last four years
seem to have passed in no time

69
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,082
Now you'll go your way,
and I'll go mine

70
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,688
Sometimes, I wish we both would fail.
- Don't you say that!

71
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,691
God has a fine sense of humor
He has only to say "Let it be done"!

72
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,264
Miracle! I've passed!

73
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,205
Congratulate me too! I passed!

74
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,073
Did you see me on the lists?
- Number 332. Second Class

75
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,544
Damn it! And he?
- First Class Second

76
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,480
Who ranked first?
- Must be Harbhajan

77
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,953
I must tell my mother

78
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,038
Naren, go and get some rest.
I'll take over for some time

79
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,870
I sent Peter to inform my mother
He hasn't returned yet

80
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,748
That heart ailment of hers...
what if she reads the papers?

81
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,347
Excuse me, my name is Pramod Das.
How is my son Sunil?

82
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,813
Yes. Sunil Das

83
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,225
Yes, he's fine.
- Are you lying? I hear he's dead

84
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,586
The name of the person who has died
is Harbhajan Singh

85
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,724
But where's my son, Sunil?
- Take him to Sunil

86
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,774
I've told your mother
- You did?

87
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:28,569
Yes. But it was such a snafu!
- Why?

88
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,538
I told her that you've just
scratched your head

89
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,477
And she drags me right into
her prayer room...

90
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,822
And she wants me to swear it
by the Gods!

91
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,715
I couldn't even tell her that
I'm Christian

92
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,721
Had I said that, she would've thought
I'm trying to fool her

93
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,496
And you warned me that
she has a heart ailment

94
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,494
So I just shut my eyes tight, and
I touched the feet of your God

95
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:59,132
That's when she embraced me, and she
started crying. And I was praying...

96
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:07,617
Holy Mary, Mother of God, forgive me,
but I made a mother happy, didn't I?

97
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:16,422
Son, I just read about the accident
in the newspapers

98
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,489
Are you hurt too?
- Nothing serious

99
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:25,097
One of your relatives too?
- Yes. We read someone's dead!

100
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,775
May I look around?

101
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,772
Yes, why not?
- Please be seated

102
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,496
Hurt in the legs?
- Yes, it's very painful

103
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,999
I know, but you must be brave

104
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:03,101
You have to become an engineer
You must serve the nation

105
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:09,172
I shall pray to God
for you swift recovery

106
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,382
Hurts?
- Not really. A minor wound

107
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,155
Have you sent word home?
- Yes

108
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:31,693
It's just a passing phase, son.
Keep this

109
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:38,966
Cracked that skull?
- Yes

110
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:45,213
You know, that's a crack hard to fill.
- Yes, but it isn't split wide open

111
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,214
And with your blessings, it will heal.
- Of course it will, son

112
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,223
A leg and an arm too?

113
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,859
But don't you worry.
Everything will be all right

114
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,973
What?
- Do you know who he is?

115
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,973
No.
- Not even from his hair?

116
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,046
Grandpa...?
- Yes

117
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:24,013
I should've guessed. Family or not,
it makes no difference for him

118
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,822
Naren... hurry up! Come on.
- Why?

119
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,524
I think Harbhajan Singh's parents are
here. I haven't the guts to face them

120
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,226
Come along

121
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,231
Excuse me, I'm Gurnam Singh
...Harbhajan's father

122
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,399
Where's Harbhajan?

123
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,274
What is the matter?
Where is Harbhajan?

124
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,786
Why do you not speak?

125
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,086
Why don't you speak?

126
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,221
Where is my son?

127
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,675
Look at me

128
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:29,277
Swear this by me,
if God asks you...

129
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,951
Which one of these boys will you
give away to keep your Harbhajan?

130
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:40,093
Would you have Him take away
another mother's son?

131
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:48,900
Harbhajan was a good son.
Everyone loved him

132
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,299
My son...!
- That's why God has taken him

133
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,833
Come

134
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,347
What are you doing here all alone?

135
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,518
I've been looking all over for you

136
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,145
You always tell me...

137
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,155
Look up at the sky once a day
and you will know yourself

138
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,159
Not I. Swami Dhruvanand said that

139
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,698
But it makes me afraid.
- Why Naren?

140
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,697
Look, those stars are
full of questions

141
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,740
Still thinking about Harbhajan?

142
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:10,018
Does life hold a meaning?
- Yes

143
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,015
What?
- Second-hand impressions won't do

144
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:18,753
Every man must try to find
the meaning for himself

145
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:26,101
No, I don't think there's
any purpose, any meaning

146
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:33,909
Harbhajan is gone. Of the rest of us,
who's headed where no one knows

147
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,004
Tomorrow, I'm headed home...
and you, back to your village

148
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:43,742
And afterwards, what remains
of this friendship, this love?

149
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:49,049
Why must you think like that?
Wherever we are...

150
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,494
Under these very skies
we shall live...

151
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,657
And we will be as far from
those stars, as we are now

152
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,927
Naren, see those stars over there?

153
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:07,143
The brightest of them is the "Swati"

154
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,711
Shall I tell you a secret?
- What?

155
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:18,278
I'm in love with Swati!
I've even told her that...

156
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:24,160
When I marry, I'll call
my bride Swati. By her

157
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:31,996
That star beside Swati is "Chitra".
You can have her

158
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:39,703
All you need to do is look up at them.
And you'll know, we're still friends

159
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:56,758
Well, what reads the New India?
- The Gita

160
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,195
What a revolution!

161
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:07,069
These days, they use the book
to swear by

162
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:12,298
And those who read it are either
recluses or lovelorn souls

163
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:18,911
Nothing of the sort. I'm neither
a recluse nor am I lovelorn

164
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:26,722
Then you should settle down.
I have a girl in mind

165
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,762
The kind that poets like Kalidas
would write about

166
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,256
"Lean, like a whip"

167
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,897
"Lips, like ripen pods"

168
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,266
"Eyes, darting like the doe"

169
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,973
"Darting downwards, the navel
and downwards"

170
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:49,938
"Swaying gently, upwards
from the hips to the breasts"

171
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,140
Need I explain more?
- Oh no

172
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,283
But the verve with which
you describe her beauty...

173
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:02,022
Gives the impression that the girl
you have in mind isn't for me

174
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:08,054
Not so much of a century or so ago,
one as high-born as I am...

175
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,367
Could've had one,
even at my age!

176
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,092
Letter for you

177
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,063
Have you told him?
- I was just telling him

178
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:22,172
What does he have to say?
- He is yet to say

179
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:28,414
But I have described her,
to profound effect

180
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,311
Certainly profound. But a wedding
will have to be kept in abeyance

181
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,417
Why?
- I've been called for a job interview

182
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,124
Job... what?
- Interview. In Bombay

183
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,618
You have been asked in

184
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,439
Be seated

185
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,642
Mr Shyamsunder, our managing director

186
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,008
First class second?
Why not First class First?

187
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,910
The one who stood first
was a better student

188
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,390
Well said. That's a healthy outlook

189
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:46,489
Only one thing goes against him.
Lack of experience

190
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,264
Experience will come after he joins

191
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:53,168
Besides, if not people like us,
who will patronize...

192
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,505
Such capable young men?
- You are right

193
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,273
If you can please us,
we will keep you happy

194
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,671
We wish to send you to America
for further studies

195
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,208
Any reservations about going abroad?
- None at all

196
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,075
Send Chatterjee in

197
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,820
You may join right away

198
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,354
But there's a condition.
- Yes, sir?

199
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:19,025
You may have to travel.
At 24 hours notice

200
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,124
I have no problems

201
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,093
Mr Chatterjee, this is
Mr Satyapriya Acharya

202
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:29,030
Project Engineer.
Mr Chatterjee is our overseer

203
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,505
Chatterjee, take him around,
introduce him

204
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,448
The wisdom of appointing someone
without a proper investigation...?

205
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:48,781
What's there to investigate?
- I have a feeling he's too smart

206
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,052
He'll weather with time

207
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,497
And, we have to finalize everything
at the meeting this evening

208
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,529
How do you expect to find a qualified
engineer at such short notice?

209
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,331
Please don't call me MiSt€ll
My name is Ononto Chatterjee

210
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,504
Anant Chatterjee?
- Only O's. Ononto

211
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,039
Call me Ononto, or just Chatterjee.
- All right, I'll call you Chatterjee

212
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,749
Let's have the papers, Chatterjee.
How about getting to work?

213
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,920
Work? Forgive me, what work?

214
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,084
I've been here all of two months,
and there's no work to do!

215
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,095
How do you spend the time?
- I'm not spending time

216
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:34,163
It's time that's spending me!
Sir, as a kid...

217
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,201
I used to love writing poems.
I've taken it up again

218
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,208
But I have a feeling that work
is about to start soon enough

219
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,946
But Chatterjee, I can't sit idle
for a whole day

220
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,818
I'm talking months, sir

221
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,481
This evening, we have a meeting
of the Board of Directors

222
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,227
I'd like to introduce you to the
Board members. Please stay back

223
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,575
It's been going on all evening.
Now it's past ten!

224
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,605
They might've forgotten all about you

225
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,409
Where are you going?
- Inside

226
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:22,513
Don't! In there, they are drinking.
- So what?

227
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:38,056
This is Prince Vikram Singh
of Bhawanigarh

228
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,500
Mr Acharya is a gold-medallist

229
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:49,311
On the project, being smart will be
more useful than gold medals

230
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,275
I don't yet know what
I am supposed to do

231
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,552
All you have to do is to conduct
a survey of the Prince's estates

232
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,415
How much land is it?
- Say, a thousand acres

233
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:06,152
I'll need to take Chatterjee along.
I'll require tools for the survey too

234
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,532
Skip the minor details. Be at the
Victoria Terminus tomorrow evening

235
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,634
We are taking the Calcutta Mail.
- May I know where we are going?

236
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:22,641
Mr Acharya, you're coming with us.
If we go to hell, you're coming too

237
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,449
Say, any reservations?
- This is not about reservations

238
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,683
But I didn't know of any train
to Hell from the Victoria Terminus

239
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:37,026
Anyway, Heaven or Hell, please let me
know, so that I can make arrangements

240
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:44,128
I'm Sujan Mehra. Geologist.
We're headed for Central India

241
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,436
To the State of Bhawanigarh.
We have a paper mill coming up there

242
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,499
Geologist?
- Yes

243
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:55,241
A geologist is concerned with
what's in the soil, not a paper mill

244
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,347
Anything else for me?

245
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,992
Your Highness! You...?

246
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:52,132
May I not have a cup of coffee here?
- Why not? Welcome

247
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,764
How is Ranju?
- Fine, thank you

248
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,541
Take care of my guests, will you?
- As you wish, sir

249
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,480
Some celebration...?
- Where?

250
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,013
Those guns...?
- Gun salute. For the Prince

251
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,351
I thought it's for our arrival

252
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:19,188
How about starting the survey directly?
- No. First, you are to be taken to...

253
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,691
Guest house. The Prince's orders.
- Who's the caretaker there?

254
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:28,595
Old Rustomjee.
- I had asked for theodolites

255
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,200
Without it, the survey can't be done.
- Don't worry

256
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,304
This is Gurbachan Mehta, the overseen
He will organize everything

257
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,881
All India Radio. Today is
Monday, 30th June, 1947

258
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,550
Last night, Lord Mountbatten
while speaking to...

259
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:52,326
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and
Mohammad Ali Jinnah said that...

260
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,655
India's independence from Britain
will also bring to an end...

261
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:02,428
The British protectorates in India,
namely the Princely States

262
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,935
During the devolution, the rulers
of the Princely States...

263
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,075
Will have to choose one of the two
incumbent governments

264
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,077
Stop this nonsense!
We have been betrayed!

265
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,720
The British cabinet is meeting
in London today. Till it decides...

266
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:24,423
To hell with the cabinet meeting.
We have been betrayed!

267
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:29,697
The other day, Sir Conrad assured me...
- Sir Conrad has no such powers

268
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,468
The Nizam of Hyderabad has
issued a statement...

269
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,533
Dissenting against this decision.
And not only the Nizam

270
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:41,469
Sarwarpur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Junagadh
and even Kashmir have dissented

271
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:47,512
Where's the Dewan? Has my emissary
to Sardar Patel returned?

272
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:52,946
He is still holding talks.
- Talks? Talks, talks and talks!

273
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,587
Over 500 Princely States in India,
comprising a third of the territory!

274
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,726
If we want, we can do more than
just talk, can't we?

275
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,087
Welcome

276
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,602
Be seated, Your Majesty

277
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,271
Go to the site, and start
working immediately

278
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,849
The survey is entirely
your responsibility

279
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:24,415
Gurbachan Mehta will assist you.
Ask him for whatever you need

280
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,856
I'm returning to Bombay
the day after tomorrow

281
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:35,153
Hello, Ranju! How have you been?

282
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:42,695
It's so heartless of Rustomjee
to keep you caged like a bird

283
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,808
The next time I go to Bombay,
I'll take you along

284
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,974
There are so many amusing things
over there... cinema, zoo, museum

285
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:59,014
Say what Rustomjee?
- Thank you for your kindness

286
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,321
My girl is indeed fortunate

287
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,161
No thank you, I don't want coffee

288
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,425
Mr Shyamsunder, we're going
to the palace

289
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,360
No thank you.
I don't drink coffee

290
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,451
Aren't those rocks strange?

291
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,215
Have you noticed something else?
- What?

292
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,718
We've been surveying for so many days.
But there's no sign of the theodolite

293
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,222
But Rustomjee said that Gurbachan Mehta
is arranging a theodolite

294
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:44,233
And in the meantime, we're spooning
water out of a sea

295
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,664
All right, if the theodolite doesn't
arrive by tomorrow, we'll stop working

296
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
Why tomorrow, sir?
Let's do it today

297
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,040
All right

298
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,399
Pack up and bring the stuff
back to the camp

299
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,576
Whose jeep is that?

300
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:04,919
Mine

301
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:10,919
Have you brought the theodolite?
- What this thing is...

302
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,422
Gurbachan doesn't seem to understand.
- Then how are we going to work?

303
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:18,427
That's why I came to fetch you.
The Prince wants to see you

304
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,897
Good. Now you can clear the matter

305
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:27,735
Let's go.
- Let me wet my throat, first

306
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:32,980
I had sent you two bottles.
They are still lying as it is

307
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:39,515
And I come to know that you haven't
invited the beauties to the camp

308
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,491
How have you been spending your time?
- I'm here to do my work

309
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,092
Work, work and work?

310
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:52,299
Mr Chatterjee, don't you like...?

311
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:57,101
You're going nowhere in life!
- One monkey is bad enough

312
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,907
What did you say?
- I said, I don't drink

313
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,505
I see

314
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,064
Why so sad a song, Ranju?

315
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:32,337
But it was a nice song.
- Your Majesty is kind

316
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,343
But a song like that doesn't
suit your lips

317
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:41,589
For you, this is the age of hope.
- What have the poor to hope for?

318
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:47,861
Then find something to hope foll
Look, do you like this?

319
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:54,235
No, my Lord. For so grand a prize,
does not befit me

320
00:39:54,592 --> 00:40:00,008
Ask me what befits you.
A connoisseur knows a gem

321
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:06,309
Please forgive me. I am no gem.
A gem is nothing but a stone

322
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,286
My name is Acharya. I have
an appointment with the Prince

323
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,629
Please wait a while

324
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,934
I'll take a tour while
you're waiting

325
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,148
What do you want?

326
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,951
From you, nothing.
- He is our engineer

327
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:48,355
See me Iateli
- My name is Satyapriya Acharya

328
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,989
May I know who I am talking to?
- Certainly

329
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,459
I am Bansidhar TalWall
I am the Dewan of this State

330
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,698
Glad to have met you

331
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,401
Excuse me sir, no one
is allowed inside

332
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,134
Sir, I have my orders

333
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,239
Where is she?
I'm going to shoot her!

334
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:19,220
This is my kingdom. I am the King!
And this tart...!

335
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,116
Gentlemen I told you, later

336
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,427
No, I have called them.
Come inside

337
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,367
Have you completed the survey?
- No, I need some equipment

338
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,143
What equipment?
- A theodolite, and...

339
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,540
To hell with "lites"!
First finish the survey

340
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:51,284
You'll get all that Iateli
- But without it...

341
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,885
I don't want to hear any excuses.
I want the work done

342
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,759
The plans must be ready by Friday

343
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,158
You may leave

344
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,232
Stop all this, and get ready

345
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,400
Let's take the train tonight,
and let's get out of here

346
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,076
Why?
- The situation is delicate

347
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:22,115
Everything hinges on the conference
on 25th July

348
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,886
Mountbatten has called these regents.
He is deciding about their fate

349
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,589
Why should we run?
- Because, either way, we're dead

350
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:34,225
Whether they retain their kingdoms
or not. We shouldn't be staying here

351
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,356
Look Chatterjee, I'm not leaving
without completing my assignment

352
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,768
Go back to the camp.
I'll write to Shyamsunder tonight

353
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,806
I'll come tomorrow morning,
after I've met Gurbachan Mehta

354
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,952
Who do you think you are, a fairy?

355
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:05,750
You see, she won't listen to me.
I'd rather you made her see reason

356
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,553
What's going on?
What reasons do I make her see?

357
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:14,936
No need for a detailed explanation.
It's just that some people...

358
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:22,335
Spoil their chances. And there are
those who walk straight into trouble

359
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:28,606
Tell me, who is the Prince?
A layman?

360
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,150
He wants to make her his Queen!

361
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:36,154
And not just any Queen.
The Queen of his heart!

362
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:43,122
She was to be laden with jewels, her
trousseau would be piled with silks

363
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:49,834
And she is such a fool, that she walks
out on him in a rage!

364
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,168
Have you ever asked her
what she wants?

365
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,612
That's the funniest part!

366
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,516
The princess refuses the prince...

367
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,817
Because she wants to get married!

368
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,450
Like a cat dreaming of prize catch!

369
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:16,064
Sir, you are a gentleman, and you
surely belong to a reputable family

370
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:22,437
Did you ever hear of
a whore's daughter getting married?

371
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:35,883
Silt..

372
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,662
This girl is just too headstrong

373
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,904
Maybe you can break her in?

374
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,274
Rustomjee! Open the door

375
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,886
What kind of a joke is this?
Listen Rustomjee!

376
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,287
Open the door!

377
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:18,888
What a madcap!

378
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:24,296
Where's the servant?
He'll open the door, won't he?

379
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,905
But we must do something...

380
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,101
Rustomjee did this on purpose

381
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,345
Tomorrow morning, he will come armed
with his witnesses to open the door

382
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,950
I don't care for myself.
I'm worried about you

383
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,285
After this, you will be considered
unworthy of serving the Prince

384
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,289
Don't cry. I'll climb out
and I'll open the door

385
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,621
No! You might fall down...

386
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,068
If I don't, you will

387
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:30,589
Come in! I trust you. I won't let you
do something so dangerous!

388
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,798
But...
- About people? I don't care!

389
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,136
Come inside!

390
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,496
Come back in! I implore you

391
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:51,652
Oh God!

392
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,819
There being no way out,
you should sleep inside

393
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:05,759
I'll sleep out here.
Go on. It's very late

394
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:23,649
Why are you sitting on the floor?
- This is where I belong

395
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:29,684
Lie down on the bed.
- Please don't ask me to do that

396
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,466
Well, who do you have at home?

397
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,531
I have no one

398
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,740
If you don't mind,
may I ask you something?

399
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,609
How is Rustomjee related to you?

400
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:56,414
My enemy.
- Not even an enemy would do...

401
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,787
What he just did to you

402
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:05,493
Not his fault.
It's my birth

403
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,821
Forget it. Go to sleep.
It's quite late

404
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:36,809
She has left

405
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:42,418
But I'll tell you something.
You are an useless fellow

406
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,820
This morning when I opened the door,
I saw you out here...

407
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:50,563
And the girl in there.
You aren't man enough

408
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:58,504
Rustomjee, I did not react last night
because you were drunk

409
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:03,604
But what you speak now can be called
nothing but sexism

410
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:08,347
You are right. In your place,
I'd say the same

411
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:13,779
And if you were in my shoes...
forget it, and don't be angry

412
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,855
Up in the morning, let's be civil

413
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,722
I'm going to Bhopal for a few days,
as the Prince's emissary

414
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,625
I have to be back with the reply
before he returns

415
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:33,332
In the meantime, I shall leave Ranju
in your care

416
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,074
In my care...?
- Yes. Now I know that...

417
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:40,609
You are a gentleman.
And taking care of Ranjana...

418
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,611
Is also a part of your duty
to the Prince

419
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:50,781
Ranjana is his ward

420
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,962
Remember, that for the next
two or maybe three months...

421
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:59,164
The Prince can still make decrees.
And an order for execution...

422
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:03,232
Could be made in a trice! Goodbye.
- Excuse me...

423
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,937
May I ask you a question?
- You may ask anything you want

424
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:16,079
But God knows how much I can answer.
- Why are you ruining her life?

425
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:21,619
This ruination she is fated for
- What do you mean?

426
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,586
That's a long story

427
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:36,304
All you need know is,
I knew her mother

428
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:43,341
She came from a good family.
But as luck would have it...

429
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:48,142
She eloped with her father's
chauffeur when she was fourteen

430
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,349
Now the daughter is paying
for her mother's deeds

431
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:57,449
I met her mother suddenly,
a few days before she died

432
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:01,961
I gave her my word that her daughter
would never have to beg for a living

433
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:09,629
Tell me, what could be more than
a Prince taking a liking to her?

434
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,099
Why not? Find a suitable boy.
Get her married

435
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:19,012
You want me to conceal the truth?
- Nowadays, men are educated

436
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,349
There are those of us who care
a damn for castes and classes

437
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:27,046
Touch your heart and say
you're telling the truth

438
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:28,912
Yes, why not?

439
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,950
Would you marry her?

440
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,354
Actually, I...

441
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,963
Easier said than done

442
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,770
I should be leaving

443
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,409
Could be, that by the time I return,
Bhawanigarh would not be...

444
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,075
On the map of India, like
so many other principalities

445
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,812
Could also be, that you will
have become so great a man...

446
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,151
That ones like me will have to
take care ere the hat falls down...

447
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,885
When I strain to look up at you!
Farewell!

448
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,130
What's this? Where is the servant?

449
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,233
Why, am I an untouchable?

450
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,436
Untouchable, you are

451
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:55,203
I cooked your dinner last night.
The servant just served you

452
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:59,138
I didn't say I won't eat
what you cook

453
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,415
But last night I came to know that
you are an untouchable

454
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:11,882
Listen... do you know the meaning
of an untouchable?

455
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,992
Someone who is not to be touched.
Last night you stayed in my room...

456
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,434
Untouched, aren't you?

457
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,771
You haven't given me a reply
to my question last night

458
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:30,273
Question...?
- How is Rustomjee related to you?

459
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,277
Apart from being your enemy...?
- Foster father

460
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:37,949
Foster father..?
- Why can't he be?

461
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,917
He's forty years older than I am!
- 40 years? How old would he be?

462
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:48,323
You aren't as simple
as you make out to be

463
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,155
What do you mean?
- I've told you he's 40 years my elder

464
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,002
If I told you his age, you'd know
mine, isn't that so?

465
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,900
I'll tell you. I'm nineteen.
Now you can add up to Rustomjee's

466
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,807
And I know too. You aren't as simple
as you make out to be

467
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:11,710
Now foster father he is, but why
isn't he getting you married off?

468
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:18,088
Who would marry a girl like me?

469
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,586
What do I take this for? Boyishness?

470
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,024
Maybe you want me to say
that you are pretty?

471
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:32,933
No! I'm tired of hearing this.
It's cloying my ears!

472
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:38,177
I hear every man say this.
Not you...

473
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,879
Why do you count me among them?
- Then why do your people want...

474
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:46,846
To push me into a hell?
- I never knew all this

475
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,292
Now that you know,
let me see what you do

476
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:53,719
Silt..

477
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,022
The jeep is here.
- I'm coming

478
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,965
What do you mean? First,
you will eat your breakfast

479
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,042
Sit. I'll drive

480
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:23,217
Do you eat or do you hog?

481
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,954
Sit in the back.
I'll sit up front

482
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,263
Where are you going?
- Wherever you are going

483
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:33,931
Meaning?
- You go out every day. Can't I?

484
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,304
I'm not out on a jamboree.
I'm going to work

485
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:41,633
I know! You are so busy!
But remember what Rustomjee said?

486
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,545
You're supposed
to take care of me

487
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:51,949
Put the basket in the jeep. Hurry!
He's busy, and he's getting late

488
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,314
What's all this meant for?
- Am I supposed to stay the whole day...

489
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,625
Without a change of clothes?
- In that jungle...

490
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:01,895
Who will look at your beauty.
- Never mind

491
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,566
I'm taking along the one
who will appreciate

492
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,369
Move it! You are delaying this

493
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:05,422
We have a working picnic here!
Hey, have you started eating too?

494
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:11,265
Am I? No. I'm just tasting, Sir
- Sit down and do it, will you?

495
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,999
No Sir Not once. I'm going to eat
for two today

496
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,338
Sit down. Let me brush my teeth

497
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:22,473
Chatterjee and I will eat together.
You go on

498
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:27,303
Aren't you eating? I thought we were
sitting down to lunch together

499
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,344
My mother used to say, first feed
someone who isn't greedy...

500
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:35,679
And you will get to know whether
you have cooked well

501
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:42,692
Who tells you I'm not greedy?
- One look at you, and I know

502
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:51,504
I won't mind it if you tell
a small lie

503
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:55,403
Small lie...?
- Yes. For my sake

504
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:00,374
Even if you dislike the food, don't you
get up till you've cleaned your plate

505
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:07,477
Really, it's great! I'm not telling
a lie to please you. It's great!

506
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,922
As for me, without this falsehood
I cannot even touch someone's heart

507
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,462
I see no falsehood in you

508
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,700
You wouldn't know it

509
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:24,235
I'm putting on. Like my mother

510
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:30,176
What I saw just now, is that
real self of yours

511
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,074
Solemn, a picture of peace

512
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,309
This is the first time someone
is telling me all this

513
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:46,358
This is the first time
I've cooked for someone

514
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:52,923
I cannot explain to you what
this means for a woman

515
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:59,467
Such joy! But no, I wasn't destined
to be so happy

516
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:07,010
You're crying... how am I to eat
if you cry?

517
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,534
Writing a letter?

518
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,570
You... welcome

519
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,879
You write a lot of letters?
- Who told you that?

520
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,180
Chatterjee.
- So you've made out as much?

521
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:47,418
Won't you sit down?
- Who are you writing to?

522
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:53,292
Home? To your parents?
- I haven't parents

523
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:59,464
My mother died at childbirth.
My father went away to become a monk

524
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,532
Then you must be lonely?

525
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:08,207
Lonely? Why? My grandfather
has brought me up

526
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,640
And...
- And there's Dasrath

527
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,608
He took care of me when I was a kid.
- Who else?

528
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,974
Friends. From college

529
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:20,887
And...

530
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:25,120
I'm not married.
- Did I ask you that?

531
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:31,490
Were you writing to your grandfather?
- No. A friend from college. Naren

532
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:35,232
I haven't had the time to write
to him ever since I came here

533
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:41,341
Is that why it's such a long letter?
- Yes. We always write to each other...

534
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:46,943
Whenever we come across
something beautiful in life

535
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:52,676
And what are you writing to him about?
- So many things

536
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,751
Like...?
- Like the Tungri river...

537
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,290
Its blue waters.
- And...?

538
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:05,493
And the tall trees, and the air
whistling through it

539
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,632
And...?
- I've written about you too

540
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:15,933
About me?
- Yes, about your eyes

541
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:21,711
Ranjana, you wouldn't know
what your eyes remind me of

542
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:23,946
Of what?

543
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,721
The eyes painted on
the idol of a Goddess

544
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:43,496
"From his letters I got to know that
Ranjana stayed over for a few days"

545
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,167
"And she carved a placed for herself
in his heart"

546
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,951
"But he was steeling himself"

547
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:07,656
"Because for him, the dignity of his
family, his grandfather came first"

548
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:13,963
"But does the heart listen to reason?
And a heart this age..."

549
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:19,304
"a heart that longs for someone,
a heart that longs to hear..?"

550
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:09,095
"He got to know that the paper mill
was just a fraud"

551
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,837
"All they wanted were the minerals
buried under the land"

552
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:16,199
"After the independence, the minerals
were to be nationalized"

553
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:22,780
Welcome Mr Acharya, we've been
expecting you

554
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:27,618
We are happy with your performance.
- Yes, you're due for a promotion

555
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,890
Really? I haven't been able to do much
in the absence of the theodolite

556
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:37,459
I haven't been able to draw up plans.
- We have the plans. Just sign it

557
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:40,900
Who drew up those plans?
- No one did

558
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:44,602
We did scale the relevant parts
from the Survey of India

559
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:48,669
Mr Mehta has done the scaling.
- Why not have Mr Mehta to sign it?

560
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:55,579
Because the registrar wants
a graduate engineer to sign it

561
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,747
Poor Mehta is just an overseer

562
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:03,447
You also have to attest
this field work

563
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:08,626
Looks new, does it?
No need to worry

564
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:12,454
We'll make it look aged and genuine

565
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:16,060
I will not take the responsibility
of what I have not done

566
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:19,167
Don't be childish!
This is a matter of millions!

567
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,599
Find someone else to do the job

568
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,268
What are you saying? How are we to
find someone at such short notice?

569
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,841
There can't be anything wrong with
the Survey of India

570
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,085
What's your reservation?
- You will not understand

571
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:35,419
Stop being childish, Mr Acharya.
Just a small initial over here

572
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:40,817
You will leave this room a rich man.
And you will have your promotion

573
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,958
Are you trying to bribe me?

574
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,297
Bribe?

575
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:51,669
There are a number of other ways
in which that term is expressed

576
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:56,832
In Delhi, it's called the "dastoori".
In Punjab, it's the "inaam"

577
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:04,477
In Bihar, the "ijji". The Bengalis
call it "something for a snack"

578
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:09,278
I don't know what it's called in
Tamil and Telugu

579
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:17,789
Considering your penchant for honesty,
shall we call it an honorarium?

580
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,298
Keep this

581
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:26,473
I haven't filled in the amount.
Write what you want

582
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:36,139
So you refuse to sign?
- Tamil or Telugu, I don't know either

583
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:40,011
But I guess, in every language,
this is what the answer ought to be

584
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:47,350
You're an interesting person,
and I think I like you

585
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:51,724
Not to be abrupt.
Think it over, once again

586
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:56,566
Mr Talwar, what use wasting time?
Goodbye

587
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:34,703
You... haven't you gone to bed?

588
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:39,479
Do you want to say something?

589
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:46,813
What's going to happen to me?
Am I to die gagged in Bhawanigarh?

590
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:52,258
You are nineteen.
You are a minor

591
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:57,827
Why don't you leave this place?
- Where will I go?

592
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,991
Who have I, in this whole wide world?
- You have a grandfather

593
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:12,673
Rustomjee has told me all about you.
Surely he knows your grandfatheliu?

594
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:22,046
Surely he does. But he won't tell.
- Why? Why won't he?

595
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:30,053
The chauffeur my mother
eloped with...

596
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,296
Who... who is he...?

597
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,497
Ruston”ljee. . . ?

598
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:45,210
Take me away with you.
As your servant!

599
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,343
After you marry, I'll serve
your wife

600
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:52,208
But I'm not married yet.
Where will I keep you?

601
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:54,554
With you... wherever you are!

602
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:59,548
No, this cannot be!
- Why not?

603
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,291
I live with Rustomjee, don't I?
You are a gentleman

604
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,067
But society won't accept this

605
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,965
What has society given me, for me
to live in fear of society?

606
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,074
Besides, I'm an outcast

607
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:19,972
But I'm not

608
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,688
You are right.
I have made a mistake

609
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,621
I don't even trust myself now

610
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:42,798
I don't understand.
- Do you trust yourself?

611
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:46,764
What if I take you in my arms?
- Please, don't psyche me!

612
01:12:48,597 --> 01:12:49,598
Don't!

613
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:56,409
Not that you trust yourself, either
What if I were to become an animal?

614
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:02,354
Will you be able to save yourself?
- What if I say that...

615
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:07,353
I do not wish to be saved?
What if I want to die?

616
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:14,364
Why will you not be the one?
- Go... go to bed

617
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:22,368
I will. But don't ever tell me again
that I'm a minor

618
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:50,398
Come on! Will you come, or won't you?
- I won't!

619
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,296
Come with me!
- No!

620
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:58,077
Rustomjee, what are you doing?
- Why are you holding Ranju here?

621
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,277
She has come here of her own volition

622
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:05,776
I'm talking to your boss!
- Enough! I'm his boss. Not you

623
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:10,089
Sit in the car.
- I won't!

624
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,050
Will you, or won't you?
- Rustomjee!

625
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,954
I'm her boss. Not you.
Come on

626
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:21,233
She is a minor. You cannot force her
- Don't try your luck

627
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:24,103
The Prince doesn't know
that Ranjana is here

628
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:27,339
Else, you would've been dead
in small pieces down the river

629
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:29,676
Now, are you coming, or aren't you?

630
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:50,224
You too, mister. The Prince
wants to see you too

631
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,259
I'm not his dog to answer his call
in the middle of the night

632
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:57,770
Very well

633
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,970
You should've stopped Ms Ranjana.
- On what grounds?

634
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,314
It'd have been better had you gone.
- How come?

635
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:16,156
Are you forgetting what day it is?
August 1. Whatever Delhi's decision...

636
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,688
Whether it favours him or not...
he's going to take it out on her!

637
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:33,099
That's why she was hiding here.
Too bad, sir

638
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,403
The innocent girl is going to be
the Prince's prey tonight

639
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:38,244
Stop talking nonsense!

640
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:48,754
Chatterjee, forgive me.
- No problem, sir

641
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:53,749
I know you're angry with yourself

642
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:04,494
Chatterjee, come on, we're going
to Bhawanigarh

643
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,739
Sill..? You can't do anything now

644
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:57,883
Leave me!

645
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:53,406
Where's Ranjana?

646
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:57,968
She's not feeling well.
She doesn't want to meet anyone

647
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,648
Tell her that I want to see heh
- Forgive me, sir

648
01:19:03,138 --> 01:19:06,881
Rustomjee has told me not to let in
any visitors

649
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,317
Is she in her room?
- Yes

650
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:14,286
Sir, please don't go in.
- Why?

651
01:19:16,985 --> 01:19:18,692
What is the matter?

652
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:24,460
All last night she was locked up.
- Where?

653
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:26,905
Where?

654
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,943
In the Prince's Bahaddur

655
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,089
Ranjana, wait.
- What do you want?

656
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:57,436
Step out for a moment.
We have a score to settle

657
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:01,536
What score? Go away.
- Will you come out, or won't you?

658
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:06,243
What will you do if I don't?
- Don't think I can't do anything

659
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,674
The report that Ranjana's grandfather
lodged with the police...

660
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:14,453
Is still in their records. And I know
who the chauffeur was...

661
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:19,725
And where he is right now.
- So you have come to blackmail me?

662
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:25,188
For someone who has always done
the wrong things all his life...

663
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:29,027
What else can you think?
I'm giving you this chance to atone

664
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:33,670
I'm taking Ranjana into my custody.
Let me take her away with me

665
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,109
Do you propose to marry her?

666
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,508
I cannot

667
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:44,480
But I will have her married to
someone who is broad-minded

668
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:52,649
And till that happens, Ranjana stays
with me. Yes? Give me a reply

669
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:58,364
Take it from me. No use talking
to him about it

670
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:03,364
As for me, I'm unwilling.
- Ranju is right

671
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:11,068
If you won't marry her, why talk of
getting her married to someone else?

672
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,774
An woman whom a man keeps in his
custody without marrying heh..

673
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:18,880
Is called a mistress.
Yes, a slave

674
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:24,551
If I have to be someone's mistress,
why yours? Why not the Prince's?

675
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,886
I'm telling you the truth.
You come from a good family

676
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:35,324
Why get involved with this filth?
For the sake of a whore's daughter?

677
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:37,665
Let her go to the dogs

678
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,139
Ranjana, I will marry you

679
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,146
Ye s

680
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,412
Rustomjee, I will marry Ranjana

681
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,953
Are you in your senses?
- Very much

682
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:03,695
Despite whatever happened last night?
- Yes

683
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:07,896
If this is what you had in mind,
why did you not tell me last night?

684
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,635
Why did you not stop her?
- Call it my foolishness

685
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:15,135
And she has suffered for it

686
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:24,777
Not I, only you can give him a reply

687
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:35,389
Lord be my witness, I have loved you
like my own daughter

688
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:39,164
But I am so helpless!

689
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:47,500
If you marry her, I don't care
what the Prince does to me

690
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:52,507
But you must swear to perform
the marriage according to the rites

691
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,647
I swear

692
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:01,744
No, this cannot be.
No, not this marriage!

693
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:16,258
Did you not hear? I am sworn.
- Forgive. Now, this can never be

694
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:30,408
Look at me... look up

695
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:37,712
In my family, do you know
when a man touches a woman?

696
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,227
Only when she is his wife

697
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,854
Yes, from this day,
you are my wife

698
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:13,217
Finally, comes the day
the whole country has waited for

699
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:18,225
1947. August 15

700
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:25,030
The country cast aside the shackles
that held her slave for centuries

701
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:28,005
In free air, we breathed

702
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:32,675
And the promise was to put an end
to hunger, unemployment...

703
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:36,277
Profiteering and the black markets

704
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,851
Now began a new era
of industrialization

705
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:50,021
Those of us who were educated,
spread out all over to achieve it

706
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:53,291
My uncle recommended me to a job
with the government

707
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,897
Peter left for Agartala.
Kohli went to Mysore

708
01:24:57,325 --> 01:25:01,603
I always kept abreast of everyone.
The only one of whom I had no news...

709
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:06,844
Was Satyapriya. All I got to know
is that he was always between jobs

710
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:12,510
After about three years,
I suddenly met him

711
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,550
Or rather, it was he who spotted me

712
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,564
What are you doing here?
- I spotted you first

713
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,997
What are you doing in my territory?
- Your kingdom, is it?!

714
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:37,336
I was here in the matter
of a development program

715
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,336
What are you doing here?
- Building a bridge

716
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:43,015
I'm a working partner
in Shah & Mehta

717
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,785
But you're strange! Not a letter
in three years!

718
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,713
Where you are, what you are doing...
the last was that letter from...

719
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,058
What's-it-called Bhawani...
- Troubled years

720
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,361
Why don't you take the train
this evening? Come home

721
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:57,788
Your sister-in-law will be pleased
to meet you

722
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,131
Sure

723
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:01,699
Sister-in-law? Whose?

724
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,068
You rs

725
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,634
Whose wife?
- Mine

726
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:09,007
You got married and you didn't
inform me?

727
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:12,743
I did it in a hurry. Come home,
I'll tell you everything

728
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,483
Hey listen! This is my friend Naren

729
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,362
Coming

730
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:35,368
How many years has it been?
- Three years

731
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:39,770
Incredible! Even after three years
of marriage...

732
01:26:40,161 --> 01:26:45,270
The wife rushes out at the sound
of her husband driving his jeep?!

733
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,806
Smart alec,
come, let me show you my bridge

734
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:53,209
There. Bridge over River Chanda.
- What's the type?

735
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:56,419
Cantileveli
- What's the length?

736
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,920
Won't you give me a cup of tea?
- She's coming with the tea

737
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,166
How does she know I want tea?
- It's meant for me

738
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:10,892
For you?
- Yes

739
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:15,036
Since when did you start drinking tea?
- I even smoke cigarettes

740
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:17,410
Improving!

741
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:20,535
Hello

742
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,416
This is Naren.
My dearest friend

743
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,751
My wife, Ranjana

744
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:28,421
No, her name isn't Ranjana

745
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:34,689
We decided about your name long ago.
Your name is Swati

746
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:39,824
You still remember it?
- Tell me, what news of Chitra?

747
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,237
Yes, Chitra.
- Has she dawned in your skies?

748
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:48,164
Luckily not

749
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:50,966
Bring him here

750
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:57,779
The baby...?
- Mine

751
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,812
One minute...

752
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:05,219
Tea, cigarettes, wife, and kid!
Any more surprises?

753
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,754
How many surprises can a man take
in a day?

754
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,757
Boy or girl?
- Take a closer look

755
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:14,589
Boy!

756
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:21,097
Hi kid! Do you know who I am?
I'm your uncle

757
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,466
And I know your Dad far better
than you know him

758
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,276
I'm your father's best friend!

759
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,914
Were he able to speak,
he'd ask you...

760
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:35,811
What kind of friend doesn't show up
in three years?

761
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:41,057
Don't you teach him how to pick
a fight. Let him learn in his time

762
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,893
Someday, he's going to become
a very renowned man

763
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,832
Are you an astrologer too?
- No need to be one

764
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,296
He looks just like his father

765
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:54,800
The same face

766
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,885
I'm glad I met you

767
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,827
It was just like the good old days

768
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:26,301
Oh yes, how's Grandpa?
- Fine. He keeps to his school

769
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,735
He has cut off all relationships
with me

770
01:29:30,598 --> 01:29:37,880
Cut off...?
- He couldn't accept Ranjana

771
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:42,779
Why did you have to tell Grandpa
everything about Ranjana?

772
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:46,120
Ranjana said that too

773
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:48,357
But you missed something

774
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:54,757
Had I concealed the facts,
not only would I have lied...

775
01:29:55,356 --> 01:30:00,999
I'd also deceive my grandfather.
- But something so harsh...?

776
01:30:01,362 --> 01:30:05,936
Something that hurts someone?
Do you still call it a truth?

777
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,773
Cowards would say that, Naren

778
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:12,512
If one has the courage to bear
with the truth...

779
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:15,286
One must also have the guts to
speak it, unhappy as it may be

780
01:30:15,643 --> 01:30:17,623
Truth is like the burning coal

781
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:21,122
You cannot expect it not to hurt you
when you hold it in your hands

782
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:27,826
Had Grandpa seen your son,
I don't think he'd be so harsh

783
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:32,234
You want to hear the whole story?

784
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:40,668
After marrying Ranjana, I decided to
meet Grandpa, and tell him everything

785
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:46,912
When we reached, Grandpa was sitting
outside the temple, reading a book

786
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:54,692
Grandpa

787
01:30:58,653 --> 01:30:59,688
Who?

788
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:01,958
Satyapriya

789
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:04,369
You...?

790
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,062
What happened?

791
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:10,676
Why are you standing outside?
Why don't you come in?

792
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:19,685
Wait...
- Who are you, my child?

793
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:29,684
Who is this girl?
- My wife

794
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:35,697
Your wife? You're married?
- It's been eight months

795
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:44,071
Why didn't you let her touch my feet?
- I'm aware of my family's honor

796
01:31:44,765 --> 01:31:48,372
I do not know whether you will
accept her

797
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:51,746
Why, what is the matter?

798
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,620
She doesn't know who her father was

799
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,489
And you...

800
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,281
You married a woman like this?

801
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:06,690
A baby?
- My son

802
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,693
But you just said that you married her
eight months ago!

803
01:32:14,762 --> 01:32:19,302
So you were forced to marry
to cover up for your sins?

804
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:22,304
This sin I have never committed

805
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:25,917
It is my son.
But not born of me

806
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:30,751
You...? One who was born into
a family of preceptors...!

807
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:37,252
Good of you not to have entered

808
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:43,564
For not desecrating this house of
fourteen generations, I thank you!

809
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:08,259
After that, Grandpa refused to accept
the money I used to send him

810
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:15,364
I didn't understand something.
You said...

811
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:18,396
"It is my son.
But not born of me"

812
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:22,969
Simple. On the night of August 1...

813
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:27,506
The Prince raped Ranjana

814
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:50,229
Ranju? Come

815
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,519
What is the matter?
Do you want to say something?

816
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:13,424
Say it

817
01:34:14,849 --> 01:34:17,830
You must be very unhappy.
- About what?

818
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:24,832
Naren's remark... about how
Kabul resembles you

819
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:32,504
Looks like you are unhappy.
- Yes! The sorrow is mine!

820
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:38,110
All my life I have burdened
people with my sins

821
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,489
How are you to blame?
- Yet, I'm suffering for it!

822
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,529
Ranjana, have I ever said anything
to hurt you?

823
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:53,899
Is that all? Is there no more
to be desired

824
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:58,660
No more to be desired of life?
Every time you try to come near me...

825
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:02,633
Every time you want to take me
in your arms, do I not know...

826
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:07,878
Who stands between us?
Can't I understand what it is?

827
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:12,879
I want to forget the past. But...

828
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:19,085
Forget it. You know I love you

829
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,583
Oh, that's just why!

830
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:28,891
Sometimes I wish I'd kill myself!
And be born again, anew. For you

831
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:02,194
Have the coolies been paid?
- No sir

832
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,661
Why?
- Our bills are pending

833
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:08,006
How are the coolies to blame for it?

834
01:36:08,362 --> 01:36:10,342
You've rubbed the government officials
the wrong way

835
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:14,373
You didn't go to the project engineer's
house on his daughter's birthday

836
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:17,944
Nor did you let us send any gifts.
- What has that to do with our bills?

837
01:36:18,973 --> 01:36:22,216
Cause and effect sir,
beg your pardon

838
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:26,188
It's still not beyond repair.
If the graft is settled...

839
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:29,551
It'll be smooth sailing.
- Come with me

840
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:43,101
I'm lucky indeed! Mr Acharya himself!
In my office!

841
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:46,407
Why aren't our bills being cleared?
- First, be seated. Please

842
01:36:46,767 --> 01:36:51,147
Why haven't our bills been cleared?
- The Assistant Engineer wants...

843
01:36:51,505 --> 01:36:54,679
To discuss something personal.
- What do you mean personal?

844
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,881
We have sent the bills.
And we insist upon a reply

845
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:01,522
Ask why the bills haven't been passed.
- Very well

846
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:09,293
Please type out a letter

847
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,630
According to terms of the contract,
we can stop work immediately

848
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,405
If need be, I'll meet
the district engineer too

849
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:18,510
The bill is ready for payment.
If you wish...

850
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:21,677
The decision can be taken
today itself! But...

851
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:25,677
What is it?
- A matter of transaction

852
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:29,385
Please meet the engineer.
Everything will be settled

853
01:37:29,777 --> 01:37:33,418
I have drawn up the bills myself.
And they have been audited

854
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:35,761
There can be nothing wrong
with the bill

855
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:39,497
Not that there is, sir
Just a matter of transaction

856
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:43,427
Some adjustments, maybe. It could
also be a matter of interpretation

857
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:50,634
That means, you will not pay?
- You are wise. You can understand

858
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:55,872
Tell the Assistant Engineer that unless
the bills are paid in two days...

859
01:37:56,237 --> 01:37:58,239
I will approach the highest authorities

860
01:38:04,011 --> 01:38:08,721
Only God is the highest authority!

861
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:13,254
Mr Acharya, only God can save you!

862
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,035
Mr Acharya...

863
01:38:22,863 --> 01:38:26,640
What is the matter, Mr Mehta?
- Apocalypse!

864
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:30,542
The minister has come here.
We have been summoned!

865
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,715
No need to get alarmed. I know.
- You do?

866
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:36,486
I wrote to him asking him to come oven
- Goodness!

867
01:38:36,844 --> 01:38:39,825
You wrote to him? But why?

868
01:38:54,929 --> 01:38:57,136
The contractor building the bridge
and his engineer are here

869
01:38:57,831 --> 01:39:01,244
Send them in. Please wait outside

870
01:39:14,148 --> 01:39:15,559
Please be seated

871
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:23,432
I have received your letter
You seem to have a complaint

872
01:39:23,924 --> 01:39:29,636
But there is no mention of
the nature of the complaint

873
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:36,809
Some things can't be put in writing.
That is why I wanted to see you

874
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,612
Very well. Go on

875
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:45,452
No need to be apprehensive.
Tell me the truth

876
01:39:50,184 --> 01:39:52,721
Why are you laughing?

877
01:39:53,921 --> 01:39:59,166
Nowadays, one is apprehensive
about telling the truth

878
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:04,004
But I've never hesitated to tell
the truth. Nor will I ever

879
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:10,204
The fact is that I can complete
the works ahead of the schedule

880
01:40:10,704 --> 01:40:12,877
But the officials here,
are causing hurdles

881
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:16,016
What do you mean?
- They aren't paying my bills

882
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:20,951
Why?
- The assistant engineer wants a bribe

883
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,225
Why have you not spoken about this
to the district engineer?

884
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:28,932
He wants expects a bribe too.
- There are those superior to him too

885
01:40:30,124 --> 01:40:34,869
You happen to be the supreme authority.
That's why I am telling you

886
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,072
Let us see what you can do

887
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:46,682
Very well, put down the names
of the persons against whom...

888
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:50,614
You have this complaint.
- They don't take bribes in writing

889
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:56,518
How am I to give you their names
in writing?

890
01:40:58,318 --> 01:41:04,758
Are you aware of the implications
of bringing so a serious complaint...

891
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:11,767
Against senior government officials
without any evidence?

892
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:18,776
Even I might be forced
to take action against you

893
01:41:19,173 --> 01:41:20,618
Then do it!

894
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:35,289
Then you will have to answer
my lawyer in court

895
01:41:43,363 --> 01:41:45,900
Sir, you see the matter is...
- You may leave too

896
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,348
Mr Acharya, do you realise
whom you have spoken to?

897
01:41:57,377 --> 01:41:58,355
Ye s

898
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:02,689
Please come to my office

899
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:24,048
Is this any way to behave
with such a senior person?

900
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:26,816
How else is the truth to be spoken?
- Independence doesn't mean...

901
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:29,781
That you may talk to a minister
like this

902
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:33,020
A minister is a public representative.
He ought to take care...

903
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:38,125
Of public interests.
- My interests come before that!

904
01:42:38,552 --> 01:42:42,159
I've invested 300,000! Am I to be
black-listed for your sake?

905
01:42:42,523 --> 01:42:44,662
You will have to apologise
to him right now

906
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:48,602
What did you say? Apologise?
- Yes, apologise!

907
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,806
Or would you rather have me ruined?
- Not at all

908
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:55,079
Please decide your course of action
after we have parted ways

909
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:59,645
What do you mean?
- While joining, I had told you...

910
01:42:59,973 --> 01:43:02,010
That there are several things
I won't do

911
01:43:02,376 --> 01:43:07,758
Apologizing is one thing I won't do.
- He's mad! Completely mad!

912
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:10,451
You...?

913
01:43:11,118 --> 01:43:16,090
Yes son, I have something to tell you.
- Yes, go on

914
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:22,006
First, please do not mind me
if I am being informal

915
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:27,071
You are old enough to be my son.
- Why should I mind that?

916
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:34,409
Son, in life you will suffer much,
and you will have to tolerate much

917
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:41,587
But for us, this suffering that you
will go through, is our last hope

918
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:45,826
On this hope, much of our future
is tied

919
01:43:46,787 --> 01:43:52,237
I don't know whether I'm worthy enough
to give you my blessings

920
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:58,800
But being your elder,
I shall pray that...

921
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:03,411
God gives you this courage. Always

922
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:55,099
"The stubborn streak continued"

923
01:44:56,056 --> 01:44:58,036
"He got several jobs"

924
01:44:58,325 --> 01:45:02,467
"But everywhere, it was his obsession
with the truth that was the hurdle"

925
01:45:03,063 --> 01:45:07,034
"He could never stick to a job.
He never planted his feet"

926
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:13,011
"In his letters, it was as if
he was taking on the whole world"

927
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:19,150
"Sometimes I felt he was also
fighting against himself"

928
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:24,287
"Once, he caught someone
accepting a bribe"

929
01:45:25,218 --> 01:45:29,860
Forgive me, sir! I have committed
a grave crime! I won't do it again

930
01:45:30,257 --> 01:45:33,727
I beg of you, sir!
- Aren't you ashamed to say this?

931
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:40,341
As of now, I am suspending him.
Please investigate the case

932
01:45:41,568 --> 01:45:46,916
I swear by God! I'm in trouble!
Just come home, and see for yourself

933
01:45:47,274 --> 01:45:50,346
If you sack me, I will
have to kill myself!

934
01:45:50,711 --> 01:45:55,820
What could be worse than a citizen of
an independent country taking bribes?

935
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:57,560
Should be ashamed!

936
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:00,563
Forget it, Mr Binay.
You know what he's like

937
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:11,937
He has come

938
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:23,083
Listen... she has come to see you.
She's Mr Binay's wife

939
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:28,958
You seem to have suspended...
- She should not have come here

940
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,557
Forgive me, I can do nothing
in this case

941
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:38,162
My son has been sick for ten days!

942
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:43,274
There's no medicine for him. We don't
even have money to pay for food

943
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:47,271
The doctor has prescribed
so many medicines

944
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:51,275
And we don't have a penny!
- That gives no one the right...

945
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:56,418
To take bribes. The wages of sin
one has to pay. I can do nothing

946
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,155
May I ask you something?
I accept that...

947
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:08,964
He has committed a crime. But we are
neighbours in this community

948
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,436
We are supposed to share

949
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:18,307
Yet, you don't even know that my son
is dying for lack of medicines!

950
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:21,607
Can you escape that?

951
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:25,408
I cannot

952
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:30,411
A child dies a slow death
for lack of medicines

953
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:33,621
Have our social peers
no responsibility?

954
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:39,393
So how do you punish yourself
for this? Is the peer penalized?

955
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:46,132
You cannot do anything to him,
because he is your peer

956
01:47:46,927 --> 01:47:52,172
But you can punish my husband.
Because before you, he is powerless

957
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:57,681
And you have the power. But is this
what power ought to be used for?

958
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:00,616
This is all I ask you

959
01:48:26,633 --> 01:48:27,668
Mr Supervisor. . .

960
01:48:31,571 --> 01:48:33,482
Who is it?
- I'm Acharya

961
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:36,679
Silt.. you?
- Yes, please come to the office

962
01:48:49,222 --> 01:48:51,702
At this hour?
- Have you sent Mr Binay's file...

963
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:54,402
To the head office?
- I'll post it tomorrow morning

964
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:56,741
Please give me the letter
- All right

965
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:09,684
Instead, please send this letter

966
01:49:15,215 --> 01:49:17,422
What's this? Are you resigning?

967
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:19,694
Yes.
- But why?

968
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,368
I cannot explain this to you

969
01:49:24,324 --> 01:49:28,534
The duty to foster precedes
the right to punish

970
01:49:29,763 --> 01:49:32,539
But my position compels me to punish

971
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:35,271
But who am I punishing?

972
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:40,741
An innocent child, who is dying for
lack of medicines? Or that woman...

973
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:46,554
But how are they to blame?
I don't understand...

974
01:49:49,015 --> 01:49:50,756
I'd rather punish myself

975
01:49:52,385 --> 01:49:53,363
Goodbye

976
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:00,098
"He writes fewer letters now"

977
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:06,240
"Once, maybe twice in a yeah
From what little I make out...

978
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,602
From his letters, and from what
I got to know from the others..."

979
01:50:08,969 --> 01:50:11,040
"he's going through hard times"

980
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:15,215
"The very reason why
I'm going places..."

981
01:50:15,809 --> 01:50:18,289
"is the same reason why Satyapriya
is going nowhere"

982
01:50:18,645 --> 01:50:22,991
"The unwillinness to com romise
1 to ignore small irritants"

983
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:28,465
"One day, my wife and I had
just returned after shopping..."

984
01:50:38,898 --> 01:50:41,674
Wait! Is this a dream?

985
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:44,377
This is a nightmare

986
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:47,346
Where have you been so long?

987
01:50:47,641 --> 01:50:52,351
He's the one who made a star out of you
...the fellow who named you "Chitra"

988
01:50:52,912 --> 01:50:55,119
This is Satyapriya

989
01:50:55,915 --> 01:50:56,893
Hello

990
01:50:57,384 --> 01:50:59,364
How long have you been here?
- About an hour and a half

991
01:50:59,919 --> 01:51:01,830
Had I known you were coming,
I would've stayed at home

992
01:51:02,022 --> 01:51:06,095
I'll make you a cup of tea.
- No thanks. I've had a cold drink

993
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:08,302
Keep these upstairs

994
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:11,199
Let's go and sit over there

995
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:19,541
First of all, where have you been
all these years?

996
01:51:19,906 --> 01:51:22,682
Where are you working?
How is your wife? How is Kabul?

997
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:25,884
They are in Janakpuli
And I...

998
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:29,685
Nowadays, I'm unemployed.
- Why did you quit this job?

999
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:35,525
It's just as easy to explain it,
as it's difficult

1000
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:39,165
Why don't you say, you're footloose?
You don't want to stick to a place

1001
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,597
You think I don't want to?
- What else?

1002
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:43,941
Am I the one who's going out
of my mind...

1003
01:51:44,297 --> 01:51:46,937
Or has the world changed so much?
I can't quite make out

1004
01:51:48,968 --> 01:51:53,383
Remember those dreams we dreamt
before independence?

1005
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,848
We were proud to be fighting
against the British

1006
01:51:57,210 --> 01:52:00,714
But today, we're fighting
with each other

1007
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:05,894
Good and bad have always been.
But now it looks like...

1008
01:52:06,619 --> 01:52:08,895
The competition is all about
how evil who can become

1009
01:52:09,989 --> 01:52:14,529
In the last job, when I stood up
for the truth...

1010
01:52:14,894 --> 01:52:17,397
They implicated me for theft.
For a year and a half...

1011
01:52:17,764 --> 01:52:22,577
I fought the casein courts.
In the end, I did win

1012
01:52:22,969 --> 01:52:24,949
But it cost me even
my wife's jewellery

1013
01:52:27,674 --> 01:52:30,245
All around us, everything
is rotting away

1014
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:32,724
There's no morality, no honesty

1015
01:52:33,613 --> 01:52:38,722
I feel like whipping everyone
in sight!

1016
01:52:39,285 --> 01:52:41,458
Don't let that temper consume you

1017
01:52:41,988 --> 01:52:45,197
The problem is with our social system,
the entire machinery

1018
01:52:45,558 --> 01:52:51,167
Just the system and the machinery?
Are we not guilty too?

1019
01:52:52,031 --> 01:52:55,342
As citizens, haven't we any duty
towards the country?

1020
01:52:56,035 --> 01:53:00,541
Blaming others for our woes
is becoming our racial trait

1021
01:53:01,674 --> 01:53:06,180
The truth of it is that 200 years
of slavery has changed us completely

1022
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:09,722
I agree you're right.
But what can you alone do?

1023
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:15,226
No! I'm not alone. Had I been,
I still would've done the same

1024
01:53:15,588 --> 01:53:17,568
But you're the one who stands to lose,
isn't that so?

1025
01:53:18,992 --> 01:53:23,338
Would it not be a greater loss, were I
to have lost myself in the quagmire?

1026
01:53:24,430 --> 01:53:29,812
But in life, one makes compromises.
- No! I won't!

1027
01:53:30,203 --> 01:53:36,154
Never! I am human! Created by God
in his own image

1028
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:41,317
I represent Him. I shall never accept
what is wrong. Never!

1029
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:43,526
What happened?

1030
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:49,363
Not to be alarmed. I was just giving
him a lecture after all these years

1031
01:53:49,789 --> 01:53:51,530
Now, shall we stop it?

1032
01:53:51,858 --> 01:53:56,307
Oh, but I must be leaving?
- Won't you stay back for dinner?

1033
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:59,269
Excuse me, I must take the train
to Janakpur tonight

1034
01:53:59,933 --> 01:54:04,006
Very soon, I'm going to give you
a very big surprise

1035
01:54:05,038 --> 01:54:07,018
What surprise?
- You ass...

1036
01:54:08,041 --> 01:54:09,019
Forgive me

1037
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:11,789
What surprise would it be,
if I told you?

1038
01:54:12,612 --> 01:54:14,592
Nothing about you
can surprise me anymore

1039
01:54:15,815 --> 01:54:17,453
Wait and watch. Bye

1040
01:54:17,817 --> 01:54:19,694
Goodbye lady.
- I'll see him off

1041
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:24,233
When did you start getting formal?
Relax, I can make it on my own

1042
01:54:28,094 --> 01:54:33,567
"Not in my dreams could I have
imagined the surprise he'd spring"

1043
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:39,311
"I was transferred to a new division.
As a Divisional Engineer"

1044
01:54:40,106 --> 01:54:45,078
Welcome, sir! I am your clerk.
We are very happy to have you here

1045
01:54:45,445 --> 01:54:48,255
I'm delighted to see someone as young
as you are in this position

1046
01:54:48,748 --> 01:54:51,888
How long have you been working here?
- Nearly 20 years now

1047
01:54:52,285 --> 01:54:55,494
20 years! Then I will have to take
a lot of help from you

1048
01:54:55,855 --> 01:54:57,960
There aren't too many problems
in this Division

1049
01:54:58,324 --> 01:55:03,501
Only the new road to Radharangpur
...there's a bit of litigation

1050
01:55:03,863 --> 01:55:08,403
Yes, I'm aware. It's nothing serious.
- A new hassle has just cropped up...

1051
01:55:08,868 --> 01:55:13,874
At Nupurpur.. some 40 miles from here.
There's a new Assistant Engineer there

1052
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:16,752
Problems have been cropping up
ever since he took charge

1053
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:22,082
Problems?
- At every step, he cites rules

1054
01:55:22,782 --> 01:55:26,491
He has picked fights with everyone.
One day he came here...

1055
01:55:26,853 --> 01:55:29,891
And he gave us a big lecture.
- New recruit?

1056
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:36,536
New, yes. But he's an old warhorse.
- What's his name?

1057
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:38,409
Some "Acharya"

1058
01:55:40,366 --> 01:55:42,937
What name did you say?
- Satyapriya Acharya

1059
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:49,952
No Mr Ladia, I cannot approve
this building

1060
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:52,813
But Mr Acharya, the work
is nearing completion

1061
01:55:53,179 --> 01:55:58,629
And your predecessor gave his approval.
- He made a mistake. I will not

1062
01:56:00,253 --> 01:56:04,793
Well, every man has his own style
of working

1063
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:07,832
And my duty is to keep you happy

1064
01:56:10,063 --> 01:56:11,474
What are you doing?

1065
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:13,836
I ordered the tea for you!
Why are you paying?

1066
01:56:14,767 --> 01:56:19,341
For a government servant on duty
to have tea at your expense...

1067
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:22,141
Goodbye, Mr Ladia

1068
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,160
Smart alec, isn't he?
A thousand or two won't do for him

1069
01:56:32,185 --> 01:56:37,464
Every man has his price. And this one
has to be taken care of

1070
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:41,934
He's the one who's sitting on
my supplementary bill for 52,000

1071
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:47,037
It's going to be very tough. I hear
he's a scoundrel of the first order

1072
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,209
Doesn't take bribes

1073
01:57:06,953 --> 01:57:08,933
Where's Mr Acharya?
- Out on inspection, sir

1074
01:57:09,188 --> 01:57:11,498
He should be back anytime now.
- Does he live here alone?

1075
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:14,202
No. His family is here too.
They have put up on the first floor

1076
01:57:14,994 --> 01:57:19,033
Please tell Mrs Acharya that
I'm here to see her Naren Sharma

1077
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:20,036
Very well, sir

1078
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:23,779
Please also tell her that
I'm in dire need of a cup of tea

1079
01:57:24,137 --> 01:57:25,207
Very well, sir

1080
01:57:32,412 --> 01:57:34,221
Sir, the Divisional Engineer is here

1081
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:42,966
You...!

1082
01:57:48,294 --> 01:57:50,365
Cut the crap, and have a cigarette

1083
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:55,804
I jumped when I heard about you

1084
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:58,845
But why have you taken up this job?

1085
01:57:59,439 --> 01:58:00,349
What's this?

1086
01:58:04,977 --> 01:58:09,221
Stop chewing my ears!
- You are my boss

1087
01:58:10,116 --> 01:58:14,428
Friends, first.
- Sure. Outside office. Over here...

1088
01:58:23,329 --> 01:58:27,675
How long ago did this hack begin?
Have you consulted a doctor?

1089
01:58:29,068 --> 01:58:34,780
I did. He says, consult a specialist.
- Why haven't you seen a specialist?

1090
01:58:36,309 --> 01:58:38,812
I haven't found the time.
I will, as soon as I get time

1091
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:41,958
The lady has invited you upstairs
for tea

1092
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:43,817
Thank you, I'm going

1093
01:58:44,183 --> 01:58:47,062
Come, let's have tea together
- I have work to do

1094
01:58:47,487 --> 01:58:49,467
Clear up fast, and come up

1095
01:58:57,497 --> 01:58:58,475
Sister-in-law...

1096
01:58:59,999 --> 01:59:01,603
Hello!
- Hello, brother

1097
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:05,077
He has become a big boy!

1098
01:59:06,272 --> 01:59:09,014
Lady, you don't look like his motheli
You look like his sister!

1099
01:59:09,775 --> 01:59:12,813
Kabul, this is your uncle.
- God bless you, son

1100
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:17,817
Kabul? Is that a nice name for
a boy as smart as he is?

1101
01:59:18,184 --> 01:59:22,929
Son, you go and play. And you head
straight for the playgrounds

1102
01:59:23,322 --> 01:59:25,962
Don't go to the office
and disturb your father

1103
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:30,034
All right. You call him
a brother, don't you?

1104
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:34,334
Yes, son.
- Then he's my mother's brother!

1105
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:39,680
To your father, I'm more of a brother
than I am to your mother

1106
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:41,818
Go on, son

1107
01:59:43,376 --> 01:59:44,753
Please come in

1108
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:50,691
What's this? Are you coming,
or are you going?

1109
01:59:51,384 --> 01:59:56,697
I haven't had the time to unpack.
Now where are you going to sit?

1110
01:59:57,290 --> 02:00:00,169
We don't even have a chair.
- I'll have one brought upstairs

1111
02:00:00,526 --> 02:00:02,802
No! Don't do that!

1112
02:00:03,162 --> 02:00:05,199
Please... sit here

1113
02:00:10,736 --> 02:00:12,238
What is the matter?

1114
02:00:12,605 --> 02:00:15,279
Yesterday, folks from the neighbourhood
dropped in to pay a visit

1115
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:18,850
The orderly brought up some chairs
from the office

1116
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:25,493
He screamed at him. Poor fellow,
he broke out into a cold sweat

1117
02:00:26,452 --> 02:00:30,958
He says it's government property,
not meant to be used at home

1118
02:00:32,525 --> 02:00:37,702
Good old Satya. Pure gold.
- Pure, yes

1119
02:00:38,264 --> 02:00:42,474
But you can't craft jewellery
out of pure gold

1120
02:00:43,469 --> 02:00:47,281
You have to add alloys...
some impurities

1121
02:00:51,544 --> 02:00:55,492
No one can tolerate an official
who is as honest

1122
02:00:56,515 --> 02:01:02,431
At every step, he picks fights.
He has earned everyone's displeasure

1123
02:01:03,623 --> 02:01:06,229
That's why he can't stick
to any job

1124
02:01:07,226 --> 02:01:11,140
Worse, he has been picking fights
even with the radio

1125
02:01:11,564 --> 02:01:13,976
With the radio?
- Yes

1126
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:17,879
It makes me feel like crying.
But you might laugh at it

1127
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:21,485
Whenever there's an announcement
of so much of money allocated...

1128
02:01:21,841 --> 02:01:25,152
To such-and-such a plan,
he starts cribbing about...

1129
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:30,961
Who's going to pocket how much.
As if the radio is listening

1130
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:34,793
He goes on talking to the radio

1131
02:01:36,522 --> 02:01:40,527
How long will this go on?
These days, I'm scared

1132
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:45,033
We've no one else in this
whole wide world

1133
02:01:45,631 --> 02:01:51,240
Don't say that. I'm not dead, am I?
I came over as soon as I was told...

1134
02:01:51,604 --> 02:01:57,555
That Satya is here.
- There's no end to this conversation

1135
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:00,484
Tell me, how's my sister Chitra?

1136
02:02:01,614 --> 02:02:04,652
Chitra...? Well, she's fine

1137
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:07,755
But nowadays, I don't get one bit
of her attention

1138
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,329
Why?
- Ever since she had our daughter...

1139
02:02:11,691 --> 02:02:15,195
She thinks she has achieved
the greatest thing in life!

1140
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:20,533
All day, she's in a trance!
- Are you jealous of your daughter?

1141
02:02:22,368 --> 02:02:25,212
Yes, a little jealous. But I've found
a way to get even with heh..

1142
02:02:25,571 --> 02:02:27,983
Provided you help me.
- How can I...?

1143
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:30,252
It just occurred to me

1144
02:02:30,643 --> 02:02:35,319
You know, I can't bring myself
to say this... oh, but I must

1145
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:41,791
Then just say it.
- You can take my daughter

1146
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:44,130
I...?
- No, not so soon

1147
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:47,030
Maybe after 17 years or so,
if you don't mind it...

1148
02:02:47,393 --> 02:02:49,600
Maybe Kabul could marry her?

1149
02:02:50,663 --> 02:02:54,372
Now, not to be so apprehensive.
She isn't ugly, you know

1150
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:57,271
And I'm not saying this just because
I'm the father Others say that too

1151
02:02:57,636 --> 02:03:00,810
She's a beauty.
And ours is a reputed family

1152
02:03:02,575 --> 02:03:05,419
That's just why.
- What do you mean?

1153
02:03:05,778 --> 02:03:07,223
Reputation

1154
02:03:08,581 --> 02:03:10,561
Let's not discuss all this

1155
02:03:12,685 --> 02:03:13,891
I understand

1156
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:16,322
What?

1157
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:21,401
What do you understand?

1158
02:03:22,428 --> 02:03:29,778
Satya is the dearest of my friends.
The bond we share...

1159
02:03:30,369 --> 02:03:35,409
Is stronger than ties of blood.
He has told me everything

1160
02:03:36,642 --> 02:03:37,950
About you

1161
02:03:39,645 --> 02:03:41,147
About Kabul too

1162
02:03:44,817 --> 02:03:46,854
Don't look at me like that!

1163
02:03:47,653 --> 02:03:49,326
Don't belittle me

1164
02:03:50,423 --> 02:03:52,630
I love Satya and I love his family too

1165
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:57,197
Now that I know all this,
I respect him all the more

1166
02:03:58,731 --> 02:04:04,044
To seal this friendship,
for the sake of my own honour..

1167
02:04:04,403 --> 02:04:06,144
I am begging you

1168
02:04:14,346 --> 02:04:17,156
I was expecting a hot cup of tea
And you've started crying

1169
02:04:17,516 --> 02:04:20,986
This is ridiculous!
- I'll make tea for you

1170
02:04:21,353 --> 02:04:22,457
Be seated.
- All right

1171
02:04:22,822 --> 02:04:25,132
While you make tea, I'll go down
and fetch him

1172
02:04:25,925 --> 02:04:30,897
No! He will not come upstairs now.
- Why not? I'm seeing him after ages!

1173
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:35,606
I'm telling you. He won't leave
his office before five-thirty

1174
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:38,471
Even his boss will!
I'll drag him up here

1175
02:04:38,838 --> 02:04:41,409
For all that posturing in front of you,
he can't act tough with me

1176
02:04:41,774 --> 02:04:43,082
I'll get him

1177
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:51,360
Come up. Tea is ready.
We're going to have a long chat

1178
02:04:51,717 --> 02:04:54,220
Sorry, I have work to do.
- I know how much work there is

1179
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:56,522
Putting a few things off isn't
going to rock the world. Come

1180
02:04:56,889 --> 02:05:01,304
Excuse me.
- Look, I'm the boss, you agree?

1181
02:05:01,694 --> 02:05:05,471
Now I'm ordering you. Come on.
- I don't take wrong orders

1182
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:07,674
I live by my principles

1183
02:05:14,607 --> 02:05:17,884
I know, honesty is the best policy.
- Then what you know is wrong, sir

1184
02:05:19,712 --> 02:05:22,955
As far a policy goes, not honesty,
but dishonesty is the best policy

1185
02:05:23,749 --> 02:05:27,697
Honesty is no policy.
Honesty is a religion

1186
02:05:30,489 --> 02:05:32,196
So you won't come up?

1187
02:05:32,758 --> 02:05:36,433
Not until the office has closed
for the day

1188
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:42,678
Brother. . .

1189
02:05:46,872 --> 02:05:52,550
Excuse me, sister-in-law.
Let's have tea some other day

1190
02:06:25,878 --> 02:06:27,755
He's expecting you

1191
02:06:33,385 --> 02:06:34,420
Come in

1192
02:06:34,853 --> 02:06:38,027
I apologise for disturbing you
again and again

1193
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:43,467
We cannot do anything about your
supplementary bill for 52,000...

1194
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:47,641
Until Mr Acharya has validated it.
- I'm not here for the bill, Mr Sharma

1195
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,810
All I want to say is that
Mr Acharya's attitude...

1196
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:53,480
Is making it very difficult
for us to work here

1197
02:06:53,839 --> 02:06:56,479
Why, what happened?
- The culvert at Sharanpuli..

1198
02:06:56,842 --> 02:06:59,083
Has been completed
as per specifications

1199
02:06:59,445 --> 02:07:01,425
He is stopping the payment
on a strange pretext

1200
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:03,453
Strange pretext?
- Yes

1201
02:07:03,782 --> 02:07:06,228
He says we haven't paid
the laborers

1202
02:07:06,685 --> 02:07:08,995
I ask you, how is your department
concerned with that?

1203
02:07:10,789 --> 02:07:14,293
Mr Acharya is coming here.
Let me ask him

1204
02:07:14,693 --> 02:07:18,231
By all means. But Mr Sharma, unless
my bills are paid in 3 or 4 days...

1205
02:07:18,597 --> 02:07:21,976
I will be forced to move
the higher authorities

1206
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:27,043
If need be, I will even
go to court

1207
02:07:28,874 --> 02:07:31,582
I told you, he's coming.
Let me ask him

1208
02:07:32,645 --> 02:07:35,057
If you still insist on taking action,
suit yourself

1209
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:56,812
Sit down

1210
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:00,016
Please excuse us

1211
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:10,526
I'm going on a month's leave

1212
02:08:10,849 --> 02:08:13,625
I was told on the telephone that you
want to discuss something important

1213
02:08:14,553 --> 02:08:20,299
You see, I'm not going to be here.
Someone else will officiate

1214
02:08:20,659 --> 02:08:23,538
And you might find
the going tough...

1215
02:08:23,896 --> 02:08:26,069
Because lots of people here
have a lot to complain against you

1216
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:31,109
May I know the reason?
- Not one. Several

1217
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:35,545
For one, you wouldn't even let
your own staffers use...

1218
02:08:35,908 --> 02:08:38,718
Tarpaulins and tins for a festival.
- I cannot permit the use of...

1219
02:08:39,078 --> 02:08:41,456
Government property
for private purposes

1220
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:44,260
But this is an age-old practice.
- Something that is wrong...

1221
02:08:44,616 --> 02:08:50,658
Cannot be allowed to go on forever
- But one has to make compromises

1222
02:08:52,624 --> 02:08:56,572
Do you know the meaning of compromise?
Compromise is a synonym for corruption

1223
02:08:56,962 --> 02:09:02,310
A word meant for cowards. Sir please,
not to give me this kind of advice

1224
02:09:05,104 --> 02:09:07,675
I was just talking as a friend

1225
02:09:09,908 --> 02:09:14,687
Now I know. And I won't regret this

1226
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:21,325
As your superior, may I know why
Ladia's bills haven't been paid yet?

1227
02:09:21,787 --> 02:09:25,291
I have sent a detailed note.
You will receive it by tomorrow

1228
02:09:25,924 --> 02:09:28,598
I hear the bills
haven't been paid because...

1229
02:09:28,961 --> 02:09:33,467
Mr Ladia hasn't paid his laborers.
- What you have heard is correct

1230
02:09:33,832 --> 02:09:38,076
How are we concerned with his affairs?
- We are. Very deeply concerned

1231
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:40,644
Wrong! All that concerns us
is whether or not...

1232
02:09:40,973 --> 02:09:43,749
The contractor has met
our specifications

1233
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:48,184
For us, nothing else matters.
- Maybe not for you

1234
02:09:48,747 --> 02:09:50,658
But to me, it matters

1235
02:09:51,016 --> 02:09:53,622
A government official doesn't have
anything to do with that

1236
02:09:53,986 --> 02:09:58,401
Official or otherwise, one is first
a human being. I am human too

1237
02:09:58,757 --> 02:10:02,000
I will voice concern, whenever I see
any wrong done

1238
02:10:03,028 --> 02:10:08,273
If the laborers have grievances
against him, they can go to court

1239
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:11,680
That creed of the nation,
"Let Truth Prevail"

1240
02:10:12,037 --> 02:10:15,450
that you use to adorn the wall,
is also the creed...

1241
02:10:15,808 --> 02:10:18,482
You exhort your children to follow.
Cross your heart and tell me truly...

1242
02:10:18,844 --> 02:10:20,846
Those laborers who toil every day
for nothing more than a mouthful...

1243
02:10:21,213 --> 02:10:24,592
Can they ever go to court?
Can they pay lawyers?

1244
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:28,454
Can they fight court cases for years
against these millionaires?

1245
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:32,291
Cross your heart and tell me!
- What do you mean to say?

1246
02:10:32,758 --> 02:10:36,467
Despite the fairness
and the impartiality...

1247
02:10:36,829 --> 02:10:39,776
Our courts are beyond the reach
of the poor

1248
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:45,414
Try to understand. Please!
Mr Ladia is no small fry

1249
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:47,818
If you try to use every opportunity
to pick fights with him...

1250
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:51,744
Sir, I have a lot of work to do

1251
02:10:59,785 --> 02:11:00,695
Listen. . .

1252
02:11:01,053 --> 02:11:03,693
As the Divisional Engineer,
I will have to pay the bills

1253
02:11:06,058 --> 02:11:11,371
Yes sir, as you please.
Mr Ladia is no small fry

1254
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:24,719
You have to take tough decisions.
- How can I?

1255
02:11:25,110 --> 02:11:29,081
What Acharya says is a fact too.
Had he been an official with...

1256
02:11:29,448 --> 02:11:31,758
The Central Public Works Department,
he could've stopped payment...

1257
02:11:32,117 --> 02:11:35,792
For defaulting on wage payments.
But the state laws are different

1258
02:11:36,288 --> 02:11:41,897
And it leaves much to be desired.
- Law as it stands, we must abide by

1259
02:11:42,261 --> 02:11:44,707
What's right and What's wrong
isn't for us to question

1260
02:11:44,963 --> 02:11:46,670
That's exactly what I told him

1261
02:11:47,966 --> 02:11:52,915
Sir, Acharya is an old friend of mine.
And I respect him a lot

1262
02:11:53,372 --> 02:11:57,752
It's his honesty and his integrity
that pits him against everyone

1263
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,622
But what can I do?
I have to run my show

1264
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:06,696
Sir, please transfer me elsewhere.
Tackling him is tough for me

1265
02:12:07,052 --> 02:12:08,690
Aren't you going on leave tomorrow?

1266
02:12:09,354 --> 02:12:12,892
Go on. Leave it to me,
I'll talk to Acharya

1267
02:12:21,867 --> 02:12:27,579
"In Kashmir, that pristine beauty,
made me forget all else"

1268
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:31,813
"That one month, I lived
in a state of bliss"

1269
02:12:32,177 --> 02:12:34,487
"I forgot all about my office
and Satya"

1270
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:37,160
"And in no time,
a month was over"

1271
02:12:38,884 --> 02:12:42,696
Hello!
- Hello! Did you enjoy your holiday?

1272
02:12:43,055 --> 02:12:47,697
Very much. What's new here?
- Only one news

1273
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:53,366
That Mr Acharya... he fought with you
before you went on leave

1274
02:12:53,932 --> 02:12:55,969
He had a big fight with
the Chief Engineer

1275
02:12:56,335 --> 02:12:58,212
He might have to resign

1276
02:13:00,172 --> 02:13:02,152
He has been asked to go on leave
for three months

1277
02:13:21,226 --> 02:13:23,206
Where is Mr Acharya?
- They left yesterday

1278
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:25,601
Where to?
- I asked him repeatedly

1279
02:13:25,964 --> 02:13:29,502
But he refused to tell me.
As of now, I'm officiating

1280
02:13:35,407 --> 02:13:39,082
Sir, you have come a long way.
Do have a cup of tea before you leave

1281
02:13:39,444 --> 02:13:41,424
I'll ask someone upstairs
to make a cup of tea for you

1282
02:13:44,249 --> 02:13:47,025
Thank you, some other time

1283
02:13:56,928 --> 02:14:00,603
Someone wants to meet you.
- What for?

1284
02:14:00,966 --> 02:14:03,037
He didn't say that.
But he says it's important

1285
02:14:03,402 --> 02:14:05,404
He says he has news
of a friend of yours

1286
02:14:05,971 --> 02:14:08,713
Friend...? What name did he say?
- He didn't say his name

1287
02:14:09,574 --> 02:14:10,746
Send him in

1288
02:14:15,113 --> 02:14:16,683
Hello, Sir
- Please be seated

1289
02:14:19,251 --> 02:14:23,222
I'm Ononto Chatterjee. Your friend
Mr Acharya has sent me

1290
02:14:25,123 --> 02:14:27,000
Who... Satya? Where is he?

1291
02:14:27,459 --> 02:14:29,268
He is in hospital

1292
02:14:30,095 --> 02:14:32,473
What happened? Some accident?

1293
02:14:38,303 --> 02:14:40,283
He's suffering from cancer

1294
02:14:43,575 --> 02:14:45,987
I won't hide it from you.
He has no chances of surviving

1295
02:14:50,015 --> 02:14:52,086
I had gone to the hospital
visiting someone else I know

1296
02:14:52,484 --> 02:14:57,297
I saw Mr Acharya lying there.
He has sent me to you

1297
02:14:58,657 --> 02:15:01,467
He says, you're his best friend

1298
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:08,274
Are you crying, sir?

1299
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,413
The best of people in our times
have died of cancer too

1300
02:15:13,305 --> 02:15:15,285
Mr Acharya is also a great man

1301
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:23,982
Where are Mrs Acharya and their son?

1302
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:27,290
They are putting up with
a surgeon... one Mr Ladia

1303
02:15:27,953 --> 02:15:28,931
Who...?

1304
02:15:29,354 --> 02:15:32,528
A contractor Mr Ladia.
He's taking care of them

1305
02:15:37,295 --> 02:15:38,797
Please come with me

1306
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:58,156
Excuse me... where's number nine?
- Over there

1307
02:16:36,388 --> 02:16:37,162
You...?

1308
02:16:37,489 --> 02:16:41,062
Come, sit down. Look at me, I've got
one of those glamorous diseases

1309
02:16:41,426 --> 02:16:46,205
Don't you talk to me! You didn't
inform me where you are. On purpose!

1310
02:16:46,598 --> 02:16:50,910
You did all this to punish me!
- Rascal, is this any time to fight?

1311
02:16:51,937 --> 02:16:54,315
Let's talk all we have to.
You won't get another chance

1312
02:16:54,673 --> 02:16:56,744
What nonsense!
- That's right

1313
02:16:57,442 --> 02:17:00,355
Don't you see what state I'm in?
- I know. But you're talking nonsense!

1314
02:17:01,379 --> 02:17:04,155
In today's world, what disease
can't be cured?

1315
02:17:04,482 --> 02:17:08,362
Just a few days ago, I was reading
about these new cures for cancer

1316
02:17:09,621 --> 02:17:13,364
After all these years with me, are you
still afraid to face the truth?

1317
02:17:14,226 --> 02:17:16,103
Was this disease ever cured?

1318
02:17:20,565 --> 02:17:24,206
Where's your wife?
- She should be here in sometime

1319
02:17:25,437 --> 02:17:30,216
I sent her away to eat lunch.
All day, she sits here

1320
02:17:30,609 --> 02:17:33,283
At nights, Chatterjee has to
practically push her out

1321
02:17:33,645 --> 02:17:35,591
He spends the nights with me

1322
02:17:37,449 --> 02:17:40,828
Naren, what is to happen
to these people...?

1323
02:17:42,454 --> 02:17:44,866
Who is to take care of
Kabul and Ranjana?

1324
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:49,467
I'm here! Don't you worry
a bit about them

1325
02:17:50,495 --> 02:17:52,600
I don't even have the strength left
to think

1326
02:17:56,268 --> 02:17:57,246
Daddy!

1327
02:17:58,303 --> 02:18:00,214
Hello Uncle!
- Hello

1328
02:18:05,443 --> 02:18:07,116
Hello...
- How are you?

1329
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:09,220
Fine.
- How is Chitra?

1330
02:18:09,581 --> 02:18:12,084
Fine. Please let me have a word
with Mr Ladia

1331
02:18:12,450 --> 02:18:13,952
I'll be back soon

1332
02:18:18,456 --> 02:18:23,599
So how is school going on?
- Daddy, when are you coming home?

1333
02:18:24,362 --> 02:18:26,740
I don't like studying without you.

1334
02:18:27,499 --> 02:18:29,809
Why?
- No one teaches me

1335
02:18:30,502 --> 02:18:34,177
But Mummy teach to you, doesn't she?
- All day, Mummy only cries

1336
02:18:40,845 --> 02:18:44,292
I am very apprehensive when
I think about their future

1337
02:18:44,983 --> 02:18:48,829
Mr Acharya has no insurance,
nor does he have any money

1338
02:18:49,521 --> 02:18:53,162
They are in dire straits.
I had to use the excuse that...

1339
02:18:53,525 --> 02:18:58,270
The hospital is close to my residence,
to make Mrs Acharya put up with me

1340
02:18:59,331 --> 02:19:02,141
I had such a tough time getting
Mr Acharya to agree...

1341
02:19:02,500 --> 02:19:04,480
To come to the hospital

1342
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:16,616
Mr Ladia, I had a very wrong perception
of you. Please forgive me

1343
02:19:17,482 --> 02:19:21,225
Not to be apologetic.
We all make these mistakes

1344
02:19:22,454 --> 02:19:26,834
Judging a man by outward appearances
is a difficult proposition

1345
02:19:34,632 --> 02:19:38,546
Mrs Acharya, I have something
important to discuss with you

1346
02:19:39,471 --> 02:19:43,544
Surely, you are wise enough
to understand everything

1347
02:19:44,576 --> 02:19:49,787
Considering his condition... what
have you thought of yourself?

1348
02:19:51,449 --> 02:19:54,987
What am I to think?
- There's much to think over

1349
02:19:55,587 --> 02:19:59,228
You have to bring up Kabul.
You have a whole life ahead of you

1350
02:20:01,426 --> 02:20:04,600
I wouldn't have raised this topic had
I not admired you for your courage

1351
02:20:08,366 --> 02:20:10,403
I know, this is no time
to discuss all this

1352
02:20:10,802 --> 02:20:14,340
But no use giving up a chance
that comes your way

1353
02:20:16,441 --> 02:20:17,317
What...?

1354
02:20:17,642 --> 02:20:19,849
You may have noticed
the laundry downstairs

1355
02:20:20,812 --> 02:20:27,229
The owner died some two years ago.
An old servant looks after the laundry

1356
02:20:27,852 --> 02:20:31,425
The owner's widow want to sell
the laundry and move out

1357
02:20:33,458 --> 02:20:35,460
I thought about you
when I heard of it

1358
02:20:36,694 --> 02:20:40,938
Why don't you buy it?
- I...?

1359
02:20:41,299 --> 02:20:44,371
Yes, you needn't do much.
The old man is quite honest

1360
02:20:44,736 --> 02:20:48,684
He could run the show, and you'd
make maybe 300 or 400 every month

1361
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:53,279
Besides, the laundry is going
quite cheap. 25,000 maybe

1362
02:20:55,580 --> 02:20:59,027
Where would I find so much money?

1363
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:03,631
I have it worked out.
I'll let you have the money

1364
02:21:05,323 --> 02:21:08,463
Are you wondering why I'd give you
so much money?

1365
02:21:09,828 --> 02:21:14,834
This is a bit delicate.
Please give me a patient hearing

1366
02:21:18,636 --> 02:21:24,348
Mr Acharya knows what this is about.
It's a supplementary bill

1367
02:21:24,709 --> 02:21:29,351
A bill he had blocked. If he signs this
paper without mentioning the date...

1368
02:21:29,714 --> 02:21:35,995
I stand to make a sizable amount.
Sparing 25,000 won't be a problem

1369
02:21:36,888 --> 02:21:41,394
How could you dare to mention this?
Is this why you made the gesture...

1370
02:21:41,759 --> 02:21:44,740
Of taking us in?
- Not to be annoyed, Mrs Acharya

1371
02:21:45,597 --> 02:21:47,736
If you mind it so much...
- What do you mean?

1372
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,309
Is this not a wrong thing to do?

1373
02:21:50,835 --> 02:21:54,044
Let me answer your questions
one by one

1374
02:21:55,440 --> 02:22:00,685
Yes, in that gesture of taking you in,
there was also a certain selfishness

1375
02:22:01,479 --> 02:22:04,688
But let me assure you that despite
I would've helped you...

1376
02:22:05,049 --> 02:22:08,394
In such a time of crisis.
- It's best not to discuss this

1377
02:22:08,753 --> 02:22:11,700
Best? In whose interests?
Kabul's...? Yours...?

1378
02:22:12,323 --> 02:22:15,827
Mrs Acharya, I have seen life.
I've been through it all

1379
02:22:16,194 --> 02:22:20,643
I'll tell you, from my experience...
- Thank you for your sympathies

1380
02:22:20,999 --> 02:22:25,243
But there are still those who would
help me without any selfish interest

1381
02:22:25,570 --> 02:22:32,317
Mr Sharma, maybe? No doubt, he will
help you a lot. But for how long?

1382
02:22:32,777 --> 02:22:35,656
Do you expect this sympathy
to last forever?

1383
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:38,984
Or, would it befit you to be
supported by him all your life?

1384
02:22:39,884 --> 02:22:43,991
This is a considered opinion.
I'm as much on your side as mine

1385
02:22:45,356 --> 02:22:50,601
Keep it with you. Show it to him.
If he dislikes it, tear it up

1386
02:22:50,995 --> 02:22:53,601
I will not raise this topic with you
ever again

1387
02:23:22,727 --> 02:23:25,207
Your wife isn't here as yet...?
- By now, she's normally here

1388
02:23:29,667 --> 02:23:31,237
Please be seated.
- Not today

1389
02:23:31,569 --> 02:23:35,449
We were on our way here when her sister
turned up. She's sitting in the car

1390
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,583
How have you been?
- I'm all right

1391
02:23:40,545 --> 02:23:42,525
I'm just worried about
Ranjana and Kabul

1392
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:46,828
Not again! How many times have I to
tell you? We'll share what little...

1393
02:23:47,185 --> 02:23:51,634
We have. I'll talk to Ranjana
right away about coming in with us

1394
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:57,498
I'll be back after I see them off.
I'll also call up Mr Ladia

1395
02:23:57,895 --> 02:23:59,875
Let's find out why
they aren't here yet

1396
02:24:07,705 --> 02:24:09,685
Were you talking about bringing
them over to live with us?

1397
02:24:09,874 --> 02:24:12,480
Yes, why?
- You should ask your mother at least

1398
02:24:12,844 --> 02:24:16,485
Why? Satya is my best friend,
and he is in trouble

1399
02:24:16,848 --> 02:24:18,953
What's wrong if his wife
comes to live with us?

1400
02:24:19,350 --> 02:24:22,297
Why don't you understand? You know
how religious your mother is

1401
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:26,830
If she comes to know about Ranjana,
she's going to boycott us

1402
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:30,867
That's true... but...
- We must think it oven..

1403
02:24:31,229 --> 02:24:34,472
Before we bring them home.
Let them stay where they are

1404
02:24:35,533 --> 02:24:38,275
Of course, you can send them money
every month

1405
02:24:38,636 --> 02:24:41,082
In the situation that they are in,
the money would be useful

1406
02:24:43,908 --> 02:24:45,512
Let's talk about it later

1407
02:25:06,698 --> 02:25:09,872
What happened, Ranjana?
You're late today

1408
02:25:11,803 --> 02:25:14,875
Has Kabul not come?
- I didn't bring him along today

1409
02:25:16,007 --> 02:25:19,216
Naren and his wife just left.
- I know

1410
02:25:20,578 --> 02:25:23,491
Why did you have to tell them
all that? Naren! Naren!

1411
02:25:23,815 --> 02:25:26,887
How is Naren related to us?
- What is the matter with you?

1412
02:25:27,919 --> 02:25:31,890
After being through so much in life,
you still don't understand?

1413
02:25:32,356 --> 02:25:36,771
You think it's all so easy?
Irrespective of what Naren thinks...

1414
02:25:37,128 --> 02:25:41,941
His wife and his mother are there too.
Why should they bear our burdens?

1415
02:25:42,567 --> 02:25:46,743
You wouldn't like to hear what
I just heard them say

1416
02:25:47,105 --> 02:25:51,952
Do you want to know what the truth is?
- What have you heard?

1417
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:59,523
Forget it. Are false hopes all we have
to fall upon to live life?

1418
02:26:01,486 --> 02:26:06,902
I carried this paper just to
tear it up in front of you

1419
02:26:07,692 --> 02:26:11,333
But now I think, we have
no other option

1420
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:27,954
Where did you get this?
Who gave you this?

1421
02:26:29,213 --> 02:26:30,954
Mr Ladia

1422
02:26:32,683 --> 02:26:39,191
He has promised to give me 25,000
if you sign this

1423
02:26:42,727 --> 02:26:47,005
But wouldn't that be doing a sin?
I ask you, for all your virtuosity...

1424
02:26:47,365 --> 02:26:52,007
What have you got out of it? Have you
ever been happy, even for a day?

1425
02:26:53,938 --> 02:26:59,684
Forget being happy, tell me,
how am I to bring up Kabul?

1426
02:27:00,978 --> 02:27:03,857
On the very streets where you walked
with your head held high...

1427
02:27:04,215 --> 02:27:08,630
Would you have me beg? Do you want me
to live off your friends' charities...

1428
02:27:08,986 --> 02:27:14,561
To live off scraps thrown at if they
like it, and none if they won't?

1429
02:27:17,195 --> 02:27:19,402
Better than this,
was my mother's calling

1430
02:27:21,032 --> 02:27:25,503
Do you want me to take that up
for a living, for Kabul's sake?

1431
02:27:28,005 --> 02:27:30,212
What if Kabul were your own son?

1432
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:26,908
Hurry up!
- What is the matter?

1433
02:28:27,231 --> 02:28:31,543
Chatterjee had called me.
I'm coming directly from the hospital

1434
02:28:32,103 --> 02:28:33,741
What's the matter? Tell me the truth.
- What we feared worst

1435
02:28:34,105 --> 02:28:37,382
He has vomited blood.
He can't speak now

1436
02:28:38,910 --> 02:28:40,480
I'm coming too

1437
02:28:41,145 --> 02:28:43,751
Hurry up, will you?
There's very little time

1438
02:28:45,750 --> 02:28:51,757
Please inform his grandfather.
- Why him? He has disowned Satya

1439
02:28:52,323 --> 02:28:57,830
And why make him grieve at this age?
- He must

1440
02:28:59,163 --> 02:29:05,273
Who else will perform the last rites?
Who else can light his pyre?

1441
02:29:06,037 --> 02:29:07,573
Kabul isn't his!

1442
02:29:11,108 --> 02:29:13,486
Mr Ladia, I'm taking her
to the hospital

1443
02:29:13,844 --> 02:29:17,417
Kindly send cable Satya's grandfather
Ask him to come immediately

1444
02:29:17,782 --> 02:29:22,788
Also state the reason. His address is
Satyasharan Acharya, Saptaparni, UP

1445
02:29:52,216 --> 02:29:54,162
Do you want to say something?

1446
02:30:37,561 --> 02:30:41,873
You did it! For my sake!

1447
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:48,983
No! I won't let this happen!

1448
02:30:49,907 --> 02:30:51,818
I won't let this happen! Ever!

1449
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:02,492
You knew I'd tear it up

1450
02:31:03,954 --> 02:31:05,228
Didn't you?

1451
02:31:35,086 --> 02:31:37,930
His grandfather hasn't arrived yet.
I don't know what's taking time

1452
02:31:38,322 --> 02:31:41,667
Chatterjee is at the railway station.
Maybe... he doesn't recognise him?

1453
02:31:42,393 --> 02:31:45,931
God! One last meeting...!

1454
02:31:47,364 --> 02:31:49,344
He vomited blood again

1455
02:31:52,336 --> 02:31:53,644
There he is!

1456
02:31:59,143 --> 02:32:01,953
Who are you, son?
- Satya's friend. Naren

1457
02:32:04,081 --> 02:32:06,925
Tell me the truth, son.
Is Satyapriya...?

1458
02:32:07,318 --> 02:32:13,758
I cannot lie to you.
It's just a matter of hours

1459
02:32:17,361 --> 02:32:19,341
He stopped talking yesterday

1460
02:32:25,402 --> 02:32:31,910
You mustn't lose courage. Maybe he
has lived so long just to meet you

1461
02:32:34,011 --> 02:32:39,552
I have not lost courage.
I just remember the day he was born

1462
02:32:46,290 --> 02:32:47,291
Come

1463
02:33:02,273 --> 02:33:03,752
Grandpa is here

1464
02:33:04,375 --> 02:33:06,946
Do you hear me?
Grandpa is here

1465
02:33:12,383 --> 02:33:14,989
Satya, look Grandpa is here

1466
02:33:19,089 --> 02:33:21,626
Yes Satya, Grandpa is here

1467
02:33:48,452 --> 02:33:51,763
So you fought with me that day and
you walked out on me, didn't you?

1468
02:33:53,157 --> 02:33:55,159
I couldn't even scold you
to my heart's content that day

1469
02:33:56,493 --> 02:34:00,873
Now that you can't talk back to me,
I think I'm going to give it to you

1470
02:34:03,467 --> 02:34:05,811
Are you crying?

1471
02:34:07,605 --> 02:34:09,209
Why are you crying?

1472
02:34:11,742 --> 02:34:16,691
I know. Because we're meeting for
the first time after that fight?

1473
02:34:18,515 --> 02:34:22,930
What else could we do? This is the way
God wrote our destinies

1474
02:34:24,455 --> 02:34:29,734
You were to have lived your life by
your convictions and your principles

1475
02:34:30,194 --> 02:34:33,732
And I was to bound
to the honor of my family

1476
02:34:34,531 --> 02:34:36,511
The clash was inevitable

1477
02:34:40,504 --> 02:34:42,484
Are you afraid, son?

1478
02:34:44,275 --> 02:34:46,721
Of course, you have nothing to fear

1479
02:34:47,578 --> 02:34:52,152
For you know that you are entering
a life of eternal bliss

1480
02:34:53,450 --> 02:34:58,957
Know that as men discard worn clothes
to wear the new...

1481
02:34:59,523 --> 02:35:06,463
So also the soul discards the body
that is tired and worn...

1482
02:35:07,231 --> 02:35:09,211
To enter a new abode

1483
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:17,040
For the soul is unassailable,
nonperishable, eternal

1484
02:35:22,513 --> 02:35:24,493
No sword can sever

1485
02:35:25,115 --> 02:35:27,095
No fire can consume

1486
02:35:27,518 --> 02:35:31,159
The soul, untouched by the impure,
unscarred by sorrow

1487
02:35:31,522 --> 02:35:34,696
Eternal. The soul transcends
time and space

1488
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:38,763
No! Don't take my Daddy away!

1489
02:35:41,165 --> 02:35:42,143
Come, son

1490
02:35:42,566 --> 02:35:45,775
You mustn't do this. Come

1491
02:36:31,582 --> 02:36:32,560
Come, son

1492
02:36:33,584 --> 02:36:35,564
It's time for the last rite

1493
02:36:36,153 --> 02:36:39,327
I will perform the last rite.
- But his son should be doing it

1494
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:41,727
Please take care of this boy

1495
02:36:51,535 --> 02:36:54,175
After friends and family
have turned away...

1496
02:36:54,638 --> 02:36:56,743
All you have left
is your Religion

1497
02:36:57,808 --> 02:37:03,850
Only this far can your friends
and relatives give you company

1498
02:37:05,315 --> 02:37:08,353
The rest of the journey
you will travel alone

1499
02:37:09,353 --> 02:37:13,028
For company, all you have
is your Religion

1500
02:37:31,675 --> 02:37:35,623
Son, I left everything behind
to come here

1501
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:38,617
Will you please arrange for
my transport up to the railway station?

1502
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:41,430
I will accompany you
to the railway station

1503
02:37:43,587 --> 02:37:48,661
Satya's wife is coming to meet you.
She wants to pay her respects

1504
02:37:50,828 --> 02:37:54,935
You know, Satya was like
a brother to me

1505
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:01,773
I'll take care of his wife
and his son. Don't worry about them

1506
02:38:03,574 --> 02:38:09,217
I never did. Now isn't the time either

1507
02:38:17,254 --> 02:38:18,824
Please be seated

1508
02:38:20,424 --> 02:38:22,404
Where are the rest of the rituals
to be performed?

1509
02:38:24,695 --> 02:38:29,166
At the village.
- Then his family should go there too

1510
02:38:30,701 --> 02:38:35,673
Not necessary. I will do the needful.
- I don't understand...

1511
02:38:36,306 --> 02:38:38,286
Will you perform the invocations
to rest the soul of the departed?

1512
02:38:38,876 --> 02:38:44,849
Yes, I will do it all.
- But his son should be doing it

1513
02:38:47,718 --> 02:38:53,031
He is too young. That's why
I lit the funeral pyre too

1514
02:38:53,457 --> 02:38:55,334
Lie! He's telling a lie!

1515
02:38:56,126 --> 02:38:57,400
You are lying!

1516
02:38:57,761 --> 02:39:00,037
Kabul! You mustn't talk like that.
- But why is he telling a lie?

1517
02:39:00,430 --> 02:39:03,070
Daddy used to say that lying
is the worst sin

1518
02:39:03,433 --> 02:39:05,606
What lies?
- It isn't because I'm too small

1519
02:39:05,969 --> 02:39:08,381
It's because I'm not Daddy's son.
It's because I'm someone else's son

1520
02:39:08,739 --> 02:39:12,346
That's why I cannot perform
the rites. Mummy told me so

1521
02:39:14,511 --> 02:39:15,489
Who told you...?

1522
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:17,692
Mummy. And Mummy never lies!

1523
02:39:22,653 --> 02:39:26,362
This stark, bitter truth! I couldn't
bring myself to speak of it

1524
02:39:26,723 --> 02:39:32,401
For fear of shame, for the first time
in my life, I've strayed from truth!

1525
02:39:32,763 --> 02:39:37,075
And a mother says it! To her son!
Without as much as hesitation...

1526
02:39:38,769 --> 02:39:40,942
Just like Satyakam's motheli Jabala

1527
02:39:43,473 --> 02:39:46,545
Naren, I have been defeated

1528
02:39:47,544 --> 02:39:49,956
This is my greatest defeat!

1529
02:39:50,781 --> 02:39:54,160
The one I turned away
from my door because...

1530
02:39:54,518 --> 02:39:59,524
She was born a half-caste,
an untouchable...

1531
02:39:59,923 --> 02:40:04,599
Has taught me that to speak the truth
is not a merely a matter of pride

1532
02:40:05,562 --> 02:40:07,803
It takes courage to admit it...

1533
02:40:08,832 --> 02:40:13,110
No matter how bitter,
how harsh the truth may be

1534
02:40:15,839 --> 02:40:18,285
She has proved how great...

1535
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:23,319
How magnanimous she is!

1536
02:40:28,785 --> 02:40:29,923
Call Ranjana

1537
02:40:32,322 --> 02:40:33,300
Drink this

1538
02:40:35,659 --> 02:40:39,004
Yes son, I have thirsted all my life

1539
02:40:39,930 --> 02:40:43,878
Let this child give me the water

1540
02:40:49,072 --> 02:40:50,380
Give it, son

1541
02:40:59,650 --> 02:41:01,288
I am at peace!

1542
02:41:08,592 --> 02:41:12,972
Are you bidding me farewell, my child?
Come on, it's time for the train

1543
02:41:21,905 --> 02:41:25,682
He is the only heir I have left

1544
02:41:26,710 --> 02:41:29,884
I have to give him an education.
I have to bring him up

1545
02:41:30,714 --> 02:41:33,695
The school that my family has nurtured
for fourteen generations...

1546
02:41:34,051 --> 02:41:36,031
Has to be passed on

1547
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:42,263
I have very little time left, my child.
You will have to do it all yourself

1548
02:41:51,435 --> 02:41:53,073
Enough now, my child

1549
02:41:58,742 --> 02:41:59,743
Satyakam

1550
02:42:01,912 --> 02:42:03,414
My Satyakam

1551
02:42:07,517 --> 02:42:08,894
Come, my child

1552
02:42:09,686 --> 02:42:10,664
Go on

1553
02:42:14,691 --> 02:42:17,934
"I was about to give the old man
his walking stick"

1554
02:42:18,962 --> 02:42:22,239
"But I saw that he needed none.
He had found the support he needed"

1555
02:42:25,368 --> 02:42:30,283
"Family lines, the old man realised
are drawn not only in blood"

1556
02:42:30,974 --> 02:42:35,946
"A true heir is one
who inherits the legacy"

1557
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:40,593
"There was no beginning to this story,
and there is no end"

1558
02:42:41,551 --> 02:42:43,963
"Till the day man lives,
till the day he considers...

1559
02:42:44,321 --> 02:42:46,494
"himself to God's representative
on earth..."

1560
02:42:46,857 --> 02:42:49,997
"till such time, Satyapriya's story
will be told over and over again"

1561
02:42:50,827 --> 02:42:56,800
"Satyasharan, Satyapriya, and Satyakam
...they will come again and again"
