Shamu had started to bark a

""l am bringing it. Where
will l go, if l don"t bring it?""

Some big house..

155
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,196
Are you thinking about Mr.
Jeevan Ram"s house?

156
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,768
But nothing will work out.
He is very stingy.

157
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,839
He sits near his safe for
all the twenty four hours.

158
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,538
""l have been trying since
a year, nothing worked out.""

159
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:14,652
""Sarakram, there is
much difference between us.""

160
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,450
Really?
- Yes. - That"s right actually.

161
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:20,718
""My love! lf the deal is struck,
please remember me.""

162
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:22,557
Actually
something has worked out.

163
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:24,728
Worked out?
- Yes. There is a girl.

164
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,528
She thinks that l
am a very honest man.

165
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,393
""Therefore l think, that if
some money is arranged for..""

166
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:33,199
..l will tie up her
father and confirm my marriage.

167
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:35,595
""You will do it, lsn"t it?
Okay, where are you staying now?""

168
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:37,471
l am not
staying anywhere as yet.

169
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:39,566
""Then, please stay here.""

170
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:42,405
""lf there is sound of footsteps,
even half a mile away..""

171
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,142
..then it rings in
our ears and hearts.

172
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,743
""Okay, it"s time for me to meet
her. l will Just become honest.""

173
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,347
l will meet her and return.
You stay here till then.

174
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,549
""l will bring something for
you to eat too. Money, it"s there!""

175
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,248
""Stay here, okay!""

176
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:06,637
""Kamala, O lotus eyed O
branch of a rose flower.""

177
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:11,504
Oh yes. Daddy was asking
me about your profession.

178
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,374
Profession?
People cut one measure..

179
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:15,174
..l cut one fourth of a measure.

180
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,115
One fourth? Do
you deal in cloth?

181
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:21,117
O crazy girl. l do
greater work than that. - What?

182
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:22,383
l have achieved you.

183
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,123
Why have you put
on such huge stars?

184
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:29,789
""These are stars, crazy girl.
These are medals.""

185
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:31,126
l come from a big family.

186
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,388
""Therefore, l have
to uphold it"s name.""

187
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,523
l have to stick them
on my chest therefore.

188
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,859
""come, please hug me.
- Oh, go away.""

189
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,397
O my God!
- Plague has struck.

190
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,674
Everyone leave your
house and go into the camp.

191
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:46,140
Empty the village.

192
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:49,406
O my God! Plague! Dad!
- Kamala!

193
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,677
What? plague? l am dead!

194
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:01,683
Empty the village!
Plague has struck!

195
00:28:19,211 --> 00:28:20,508
There is a dangerous
plague in the village.

196
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:22,237
Some people are going
up and some are going down.

197
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:23,513
The whole is empty.

198
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,449
The whole city is empty?
- Yes!

199
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,508
Only Jeevan Ram
has not gone yet.

200
00:28:28,787 --> 00:28:31,517
Even his father must have left.
There isn"t a bird in the town.

201
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,783
You won"t get a
better chance than this.

202
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:36,726
Listen to this! Our
chance won"t remain.

203
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:38,262
How will our chance
for a chance remain then?

204
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:40,731
Make haste. l have
to search Kamala too!

205
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,566
You go. - That"s strange. l
have seen greater robbers.

206
00:28:44,803 --> 00:28:46,134
But l haven"t seen an
enemy of his own life.

207
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:48,470
People are dying.
Therefore l "m telling you come.

208
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,075
""See, even the government
is calling up now. come fast.""

209
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,676
""Sarakram, don"t speak rubbish.
l told you to go.""

210
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:58,216
That"s fine. l apologize if
l said anything wrong ever.

211
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:05,152
Get lost. - l"m going. A
good face will be ruined.

212
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:08,556
Who are you?

213
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:13,226
Water! Water!

214
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:41,629
Who are you?

215
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:47,901
""l am thief. l came to steal,
but l didn"t get anything.""

216
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:52,268
Who are you?

217
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:59,515
l am the daughter-in-law of
this house. Of the whole house.

218
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:02,786
Daughter-in-law?
Where is your husband?

219
00:34:06,224 --> 00:34:11,526
""As soon as he saw my ill
fated face, he left this world.""

220
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:14,858
And the rest of the
people in the house?

221
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:19,526
Everyone has gone.
Everyone left me and went away.

222
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:22,796
""And took the
valuables with them, too.""

223
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,402
You want valuables?

224
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,739
Open that. Open that.

225
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,088
This ring?

226
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:47,264
l have nothing else expect this.

227
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,260
""But before taking this,
please do one thing for me.""

228
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:04,714
What?
- Kill me. Please kill me.

229
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:10,549
l can"t stand any more pain.
l can"t stand any more pain.

230
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:14,525
Please kill me. Please kill me.

231
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:30,241
""My Anarkali,
when will you bloom?""

232
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,335
Dare you touch me!

233
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:36,477
You haven"t even bought a
key chain for me since marriage.

234
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:38,406
From where will l
bring a keychain?

235
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,417
Everything goes in your pocket.

236
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:42,150
""And you eat my food, too.""

237
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,613
""Since l have come to
your house, l"ve been hungry.""

238
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:53,494
Might be a thief?
-At this time? l will see.

239
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:01,035
What is it?

240
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:04,539
You have to cure a patient.
come with me.

241
00:36:04,776 --> 00:36:06,437
Where?
- Natgav.

242
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:09,373
You are taking me
to such a settlement..

243
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,779
..there were all the villagers were
left due to the fear of plague.?

244
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,548
No. l will go there.

245
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:23,593
Brother. l have Just
married after 40 years of penance.

246
00:36:24,262 --> 00:36:28,323
l swear. We are Just talking
till now. l fall at your feet.

247
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:29,665
Please let me stay here.

248
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:32,066
Any problems?

249
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,332
""A rich daughter-in-law,
whom everyone has left..""

250
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:38,739
..is breathing her last.

251
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:40,242
What relation do
you have with her?

252
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:43,680
None. l had gone there to steal.

253
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:46,272
l couldn"t see her dying.

254
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:52,245
l understood.
close this. close this.

255
00:36:56,594 --> 00:37:00,428
Please don"t leave me and go.
l will not let you go anywhere.

256
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:02,363
Get aside. When a
thief can feel merciful..

257
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:04,833
..can"t a physician
get mercy in his heart?

258
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:07,431
Whose profession is
to save lives? Get aside.

259
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:14,770
O My God
- come.

260
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:34,323
She doesn"t have plague.
But she has high fever.

261
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,392
l think she has not
been cured since many days.

262
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,675
These are the medicines.

263
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:47,869
Remember to give it
to her after every hour.

264
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,610
And put a cloth of
cold water on her forehead.

265
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:54,244
And do her massage.

266
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:01,557
""lf the fever does not come
down till tomorrow, tell me.""

267
00:38:03,695 --> 00:38:08,223
""lf God wishes, she will get better
in a few days.i will move o.k.""

268
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:19,170
Physician!
- Look after her.

269
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,450
Are you feeling better today?

270
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:52,729
Yes. - l was sleeping till
late. l saw quite a strange dream.

271
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,792
As if too many birds
were flying in the sky.

272
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,670
""l was a bird, too,
but l couldn"t fly.""

273
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,401
""A innocent child comes,
and he took me in his hands..""

274
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:09,344
""..and flung me in the air,
and l started flying, too.""

275
00:41:11,415 --> 00:41:12,074
lt was a strange dream.

276
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:14,673
Just look at your state.

277
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:19,815
The physician was saying
that you can eat solid food now.

278
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,557
Your medicines are over. l
will bring medicines and food.

279
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:27,162
l will come back soon.

280
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,558
""Kallicharan, please
don"t go up right now.""

281
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:37,596
First we will have to throw
the corpse of that luckless one.

282
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:57,276
You are alive still?

283
00:43:01,225 --> 00:43:04,558
Hey! What is this?
The cup boards are open.

284
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,127
All the materials
are spread out here.

285
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,562
""Kallicharan, look
into the inside rooms.""

286
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:09,463
""Go go, fast!""

287
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:16,229
""What is all this? l
ask you, what is all this?""

288
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:17,137
Why don"t you say something?

289
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:20,574
Dad! Dad! All the
safes inside are open. - No!

290
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:26,242
Okay. So your
illness was Just an excuse.

291
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:28,682
So that we go
away from the house..

292
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:29,811
..and you loot our house.

293
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:33,418
You thief! You
shameless wretch!

294
00:43:34,692 --> 00:43:35,750
""lt was good that we took
the valuables with us, or else..""

295
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:39,422
""Or else, she
would have looted us.""

296
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:44,428
""Mother, lt
seems there has been..""

297
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:47,369
..a man coming to sister-in-law.

298
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,700
Yes. Look at
these cigarette butts.

299
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:57,241
""Okay, so this is what she
does behind our backs. Shameless!""

300
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:00,307
Tell me who is he? Who is he?

301
00:44:01,218 --> 00:44:03,846
""Tell me, who used to come.
Whom did you call?""

302
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:06,318
Tell me who is
that low caste person?

303
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:08,657
Mother!
- You argue with me?

304
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:13,720
Tell me! Tell me!

305
00:45:19,263 --> 00:45:21,595
""lt is really a bad thing.
come, l will fill it up.""

306
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:22,391
Why have you come here?

307
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,398
When the people from
outside have begun to come..

308
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:27,198
..am l worse than them?
- Kallicharan!

309
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,264
""Really,
sister-in-law, l love you so much.""

310
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:32,402
Don"t you feel
ashamed speaking these words?

311
00:45:32,743 --> 00:45:35,576
Shame? You are saying this?

312
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:38,412
lf you had
listened to me earlier..

313
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:39,244
..you wouldn"t have
to tolerate this sadness.

314
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:40,549
Go away from here.

315
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,548
l haven"t come here to go today.

316
00:45:45,489 --> 00:45:46,478
Don"t you dare Kallicharan!

317
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:51,254
""lf you move ahead, l will
shriek and assemble everyone!""

318
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,620
Kallicharan! Leave me!

319
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,700
l have been working
with honesty till today.

320
00:45:57,835 --> 00:45:59,632
You wretch leave me!

321
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,105
Mother!

322
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:34,397
Get up! There are
noises of Kallicharan..

323
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:36,269
..crying from the room upstairs!

324
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:37,404
""come, come quickly!""

325
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:46,410
Mother! Mother!

326
00:46:46,817 --> 00:46:50,583
""Kalli!
- Kallicharan, where are you?""

327
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,217
What happened? - Open
the door. - O Open the door!

328
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:05,195
What happened?

329
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:09,104
He had come.
Sister-in-law"s lover.

330
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:12,571
She was speaking to him.
l came to see.

331
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:16,213
He started hitting me.
He hit me badly.

332
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:17,772
Where is that wretch? - She
has run away with that rogue!

333
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:27,115
What are staring at my face?
Go and call the police.

334
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:30,785
""No, Kalli"s mother.
Let that luckless go.""

335
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:33,393
lt is good that
the muck has gone.

336
00:47:33,797 --> 00:47:35,731
But what will the society say?

337
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:38,401
We will tell the
people that our..

338
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:39,458
..daughter-in-law
died in the plague.

339
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,673
Look at him.
- Keep quiet.

340
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,078
Why did you bring me here?

341
00:47:50,614 --> 00:47:54,243
l had told you
that day to kill me.

342
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:57,349
My funeral would have
left from that house.

343
00:47:57,421 --> 00:47:58,217
That would have been better.

344
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:01,347
A woman"s funeral is done..

345
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:03,290
..when her dignity
is not safe any longer.

346
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:06,291
l used to think that
l was the only bad man.

347
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:09,357
But l have come to know today..

348
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:11,424
..that there are worse
people than me in this world.

349
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:16,103
Why did you help me?

350
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:22,371
l myself don"t know
why l sympathize with you.

351
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:26,112
""Maybe because,
our lives are alike.""

352
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,782
""God didn"t love you,
and you were widowed.""

353
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,724
""The world didn"t love me,
and l became a thief.""

354
00:48:37,228 --> 00:48:38,786
What do l do now?
Where do l go now?

355
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:43,790
come with me.
- With you?

356
00:48:44,235 --> 00:48:45,065
Are you scared?

357
00:48:46,604 --> 00:48:48,799
""Will you not believe in me,
Just like the people of the world?""

358
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:53,543
""l am a bad man,
but l am not evil.""

359
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:58,406
l vow that if you
come to my house..

360
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,177
..my religion will have
no effect on your glory.

361
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:04,154
Please believe me.
Please believe me.

362
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:17,762
What is this? l was scared.
l almost vomited.

363
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:20,367
What did l spoil of
yours in so many days?

364
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:23,204
l thought that it
was someone else.

365
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:24,103
What did you think?

366
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:31,106
Who is this?

367
00:49:32,216 --> 00:49:33,706
Jeevan Ram"s daughter-in-law.

368
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:36,777
You cleared the
goods with the house?

369
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:42,191
They took all their valuables with
them leaving her to die in plague.

370
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:45,786
You took her with you. A real theif
doesn"t retun with empty hands.

371
00:49:46,397 --> 00:49:50,128
Did l told anything wrong. -
l am sorry he is my friend.

372
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:53,400
This is brother of a theif
Kirakat. He is not a bad man.

373
00:49:57,574 --> 00:50:04,241
""Go and get some food. -
Tell me, what l can do for you.""

374
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:05,470
Nothing brother.

375
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,878
Did you hear? She
called me her brother?

376
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,419
My mother never called me son..

377
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,481
..how did she call me
her brother? Say something!

378
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,420
lt"s okay. She is
your sister from today.

379
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:23,232
My sister? Okay. lt"s good.
You are my sister from today.

380
00:50:24,768 --> 00:50:26,360
But will you keep her
here in this dungeon?

381
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:29,296
No. She will stay in my house.

382
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,431
Say it a little softly.
lf Jeevan ram hears it..

383
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:33,635
..he will ruin
all of us in a snap.

384
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:36,169
Do you know? Punishment
for stealing is a year.

385
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:38,706
And to move a woman here
and there is seven years.

386
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:42,784
My name is Shaaka. l
will cross the whole family.

387
00:50:43,287 --> 00:50:45,653
Yes brother. l can"t
hear it. l will bring food.

388
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:48,523
l will bring food okay. Food.

389
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:34,627
Please come. come inside.

390
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:41,770
l have been out since many days.

391
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:43,574
Therefore the house
couldn"t be cleaned.

392
00:51:44,848 --> 00:51:50,844
Please sit. This is Daboo.

393
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,256
There are only two people
close to me in this locality.

394
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:55,455
""One is this Daboo,
who can"t speak.""

395
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,591
And another is the blind
beggar woman who can"t see.

396
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,119
Please sit.

397
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:24,252
You are still standing?
Please sit.

398
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:26,287
This room is your"s from today.

399
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:27,621
l will sleep there.

400
00:52:29,293 --> 00:52:30,419
l am going to the market.

401
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:32,895
Please tell me if you
need anything special.

402
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:37,765
Please bring an idol of God.

403
00:52:38,769 --> 00:52:41,499
God"s idol? Okay.

404
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:29,683
Who is it?
- Me. Babloo from the outside.

405
00:53:30,254 --> 00:53:31,243
Sir has sent ration.

406
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:33,689
""Keep it outside, l will take it.""

407
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:05,210
Did you look at her?

408
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,782
How is she to look at?
- O God!

409
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,787
ls she beautiful?
- ls she young?

410
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,728
Didn"t we tell so?
Didn"t we tell so?

411
00:54:21,238 --> 00:54:23,229
What happened! O God!

412
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,224
You have changed
this house completely.

413
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:56,899
""This is for you. You
like white, don"t you?""

414
00:55:05,449 --> 00:55:06,211
This is your God"s idol.

415
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:10,381
But what is the need of
this in a thief"s house?

416
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:15,053
Maybe this is the house
that needs him the most.

417
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:31,598
l can"t understand.

418
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:34,468
""lf she wanted to run,
why didn"t she run earlier?""

419
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,406
Who is it?

420
00:55:38,682 --> 00:55:39,876
Does Mrs. Shanti stay here?

421
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,152
Who are you?
- l am a lawyer.

422
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:49,614
Please call Mrs. Shanti.

423
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:52,819
""What is it, tell us!""

424
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:57,426
""Actually. Mrs. Shanti"s
uncle Mr. Bishandas, who had..""

425
00:55:57,501 --> 00:56:00,629
""..gone to Assam on
business purposes, has expired.""

426
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:03,362
And he has named his whole
legacy in Mrs. Shanti"s name.

427
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,374
His legacy comes up to
something about 6 million.

428
00:56:11,248 --> 00:56:13,239
""Please call her, so that
l can give her the papers.""

429
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:17,210
Why are you standing?
Please come and sit.

430
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:22,251
""Kallicharan, please bring some
milk and sweets for the lawyer.""

431
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:24,122
Why are you
taking so much trouble.

432
00:56:24,194 --> 00:56:25,183
What"s so troublesome is that?

433
00:56:25,328 --> 00:56:28,456
Our daughter-in-law
is a Goddess incarnate.

434
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:32,396
But since the
time she has widowed..

435
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:35,404
..she stays
here for six months..

436
00:56:35,472 --> 00:56:36,336
..and six months she
goes on a pilgrimage.

437
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,534
She has gone Just
day before yesterday.

438
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:39,734
Yes. Just the day
before yesterday.

439
00:56:42,245 --> 00:56:43,337
Please tell me her address then.

440
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,569
l will send her these papers.

441
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:47,079
Who knows the address of
the devotees of the Lord?

442
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,413
""Maybe she has gone
to Mathura, Vrindavan..""

443
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:52,478
""Kashi, or Haridwar.
Let"s do one thing.""

444
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:53,886
Please give these papers to us.

445
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,686
We will take her
signatures on them.

446
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:59,160
Excuse me. But l can"t
give you these papers legally.

447
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:02,290
Please do one thing.
This is my card.

448
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,031
Please give me a
message whenever she comes.

449
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:07,568
""Okay, l will
leave now. Greetings.""

450
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,505
He expired leaving a
legacy of six million.

451
00:57:16,213 --> 00:57:19,307
lt is good that he expired.
But this wretched lawyer.

452
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,707
What would he lose if
he would come two days ago?

453
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,378
And what would
you have lost if you..

454
00:57:24,454 --> 00:57:26,319
..had kept your hands
and your tongue in check?

455
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:28,117
Six million have Just
come and gone with the wind.

456
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:29,123
What is my mistake in that?

457
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,660
You were the one who called
her "luckless" day in and day out.

458
00:57:32,796 --> 00:57:34,661
As if you used to
hug her the whole day.

459
00:57:35,232 --> 00:57:37,723
A loss of six million!
Six million.

Give a report to the police.

461
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,137
That the daughter-in-law
has run away. - Mother!

462
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:45,137
She has not run herself.
That rogue has eloped with her.

463
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:46,598
She was lying unconscious.

464
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:51,144
You son of a donkey! You
had something else last night.

465
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:52,537
lt Just came out
of my mouth. Father.

466
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,217
came out of your mouth!

467
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:58,879
This means that she has not
gone according to her wishes.

468
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,350
Okay. l will write a

But where has
the valuables gone?

00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:15,365
We will Just hide some
of our valuables outside..

473
00:58:15,438 --> 00:58:18,168
..and tell the police
that these things are stolen.

474
00:58:18,308 --> 00:58:20,367
When the police
will catch the two..

475
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:21,307
..we will convince our
daughter-in-law sweetly.

476
00:58:21,578 --> 00:58:22,510
Did you understand? Yes?

""Get lost from here, you fool!""

481
00:58:34,224 --> 00:58:35,384
Where will she go
away from the police?

482
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:39,586
Have you seen all around?

483
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,060
""Yes, dad,
everything is all right.""

484
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:42,129
Give it to me.

485
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,740
""Have you seen all the Jewelry,
we will have to tell the police.""

486
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:53,198
Yes. Yes. Keep all of it.

Please sit. - Okay.

489
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:34,240
Do you have any photo
of your daughter-in-law?

490
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:35,112
Oh yes. l have it.

491
00:59:35,385 --> 00:59:37,444
""Kallicharan, please go and
get daughter-in-law"s photo.""

Have confidence. We
will try our level best.

496
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:49,220
This is sister-in-law"s photo.

497
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:54,534
All right. Let"s go.

498
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:25,822
""Ma"am. Ma"am, Ma"am.""

499
01:01:26,262 --> 01:01:27,160
What is it?

500
01:01:29,265 --> 01:01:30,163
Mr. Shaaka has come.

501
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,165
Bring my clothes.

502
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:48,775
Shaaka! My darling!
Are you all right?

503
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:57,788
l had almost lost you.
l am so happy today!

504
01:02:05,802 --> 01:02:08,396
When we knew that plague
had struck there and you..

505
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:10,598
..could not be found
when searched we were scared.

506
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:14,608
You took so much time
after getting so many valuables.

507
01:02:19,616 --> 01:02:26,818
l could"t get the valuables.
What are you saying?

508
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:31,817
That these rich people
are smarter than us. - Means?

509

He had taken all
his valuables with him..

510
01:02:35,498 --> 01:02:36,487
..while he left the
house due to the plague scare.

511
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:40,767
You didn"t get anything?
Was there nothing in the house?

512
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:42,764
Something was there. - What?

513
01:02:45,308 --> 01:02:46,570
The deserted map of the house.

514
01:02:49,846 --> 01:02:50,835
What were you doing
there since so long then?

515
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:55,183
Serving. - Serving?
- Yes service.

516
01:02:57,287 --> 01:02:58,185
Since when have
you given up stealing

517
01:02:58,288 --> 01:02:59,186
..and become a messiah?

518
01:03:00,223 --> 01:03:02,783
l will tell you later.
l need some money today.

519
01:03:03,726 --> 01:03:15,797
""Money, Shaaka, you know your
deal. Bring and take a way.""

520
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:22,335
""lf Shaaka knows how to give,
he knows how to take too.""

521
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:27,616
""Shaaka, there should be
no problems in accounts.""

522
01:03:28,251 --> 01:03:30,242
What has happened to you?

523
01:03:31,254 --> 01:03:33,552
Are you not happy
that he is alive?

524
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:38,885
You can earn millions
through him. Please give it to him.

525
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:46,496
Okay. But tonite"s

526

Tonite l will dance
only for him!

527
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:05,713
Shaaka! Today you

""And where your house is,
that is my house.""

532
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:24,131
""No Rita, l.. - Sabrina!""

533
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:33,579
""Shaaka, You
make me wait so long.""

534
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:37,583
You can go.

535
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:52,257
""Here, take this drink.
Please drink. You drink.""

So why do you do such things
that you are out of senses.

558
01:14:56,869 --> 01:15:01,033
A human is called
human because he has sense.

What are you doing? Go to sleep.

Go inside. - Okay l"ll go.""

lt"s written that all
your wishes will come true.

You also know how to read palm?

Such long life.

610

You"ll have three sons.

""No, no. One by one.

You are a very talented man.

613
01:19:03,349 --> 01:19:06,011
Thanks to you. -
What else is written?

614
01:19:06,085 --> 01:19:08,076
Only happiness is
written in your destiny.

615
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,187
You have the habit
Of sharing your food.

616
01:19:10,856 --> 01:19:13,689
lf there is a single bread
in your house and some one..

617
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:16,692
..asks for it then you"ll give
it to him and you"ll sleep hungry.

618
01:19:16,862 --> 01:19:20,025
That is my habit.
Tell me what else is written?

619
01:19:20,866 --> 01:19:22,197
What else should l say?
lt"s written in your hands..

620
01:19:22,268 --> 01:19:24,031
..that you"re
destined to be a queen.

621
01:19:24,103 --> 01:19:26,697
""The truth is this,
whoever holds your hands..""

622
01:19:26,872 --> 01:19:29,705
..he"s destiny
will be wide open.

623
01:19:29,809 --> 01:19:34,303
And l"ll crack
open your head. Rascal.

624
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,144
""Say Guudki, who
was that scoundrel?""

625
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:43,050
You"re calling him a scoundrel.
He"s a very talented man.

626
01:19:43,122 --> 01:19:44,316
He"s a talented man!

627
01:19:44,824 --> 01:19:46,655
The elder said it right.
That when you have money..

628
01:19:46,826 --> 01:19:47,986
..you"re mind also changes.

629
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,651
Today you got the Jewelry..

630
01:19:48,828 --> 01:19:50,659
..and you already
started your love affair.

631
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,661
""See doctor,
don"t speak like this.""

632
01:19:53,065 --> 01:19:54,657
l belong to the RaJput"s
family..

633
01:19:55,067 --> 01:19:56,659
..He had come here to see my hand..

634
01:19:56,836 --> 01:19:59,999
""Doctor, he took my bracelet.""

635
01:20:00,072 --> 01:20:02,666
He took your bracelet
Or you gave it to him?

636
01:20:02,842 --> 01:20:05,003
l understand everything.
Take off the Jewelry.

637
01:21:21,854 --> 01:21:23,685
""Sister, look who is coming?""

638
01:21:30,796 --> 01:21:36,132
""Fill it, How she has covered her
face, As she is a Goddess.""

639
01:21:36,435 --> 01:21:39,131
lf she"s worthy of showing her
face then only she"ll show it.

640
01:21:39,205 --> 01:21:42,641
Look sister how she"s
wearing that sari so high.

641
01:21:42,808 --> 01:21:46,300
lf she doesn"t wear it high
then how will she hide her legs?

642
01:21:47,813 --> 01:21:50,976
""See John uncle, now this
locality has become pig"s farm.""

643
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:53,141
l told you before only. lf you
would have supported a little..

644
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:55,653
..then l would have
thrown this trash out.

645
01:21:55,821 --> 01:21:58,153
But nobody listens to me.
Now all the daughters..

646
01:21:58,224 --> 01:22:00,658
..will be
restricted to their residences.

647
01:22:00,826 --> 01:22:03,818
But who is she? Staying
At house of such a man..

648
01:22:03,896 --> 01:22:04,828
..she must be some..

649
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:12,667
Leaving so soon? Wait there.
Look she"s leaving.

650
01:22:41,133 --> 01:22:43,124
Oh Lord Rama!

651
01:22:43,802 --> 01:22:46,032
Eat this up blind mother. Here.

652
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,651
Master? - What is it?

653
01:23:03,822 --> 01:23:05,983
""The woman living in your house,
is she a bad woman?""

654
01:23:06,058 --> 01:23:06,820
What did you say?

655
01:23:07,059 --> 01:23:09,653
l didn"t say it. The
local people were saying that.

656
01:23:09,828 --> 01:23:11,989
And the one who fixes tyres..
- What did he say?

657
01:23:12,831 --> 01:23:16,130
""He was saying, you support me
and l"ll throw out this trash.""

658
01:23:32,785 --> 01:23:34,616
Who"s there? - Who"s there?

659
01:23:38,791 --> 01:23:41,624
Some one help. What happened?

660
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:48,622
He is killing him.
Some one help.

661
01:23:48,801 --> 01:23:51,634
What"s happening?
- Some one help.

662
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,643
Till today l"ve never
said anything to anybody.

663
01:24:00,813 --> 01:24:05,648
But to day l"m saying that
if some speaks out a word..

664
01:24:05,818 --> 01:24:08,150
..then what will be the
consequences see it yourself.

665
01:24:22,468 --> 01:24:23,662
""What are you doing?
- Get aside, Shanti.""

666
01:24:24,837 --> 01:24:28,671
""Shanti, get aside.
l"ll kill this man now.""

667
01:24:59,872 --> 01:25:01,032
""l apologize for this, brother.""

668
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:09,700
Now l know that for you there
is no value for human lives.

669
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:12,366
l"ve been hearing
insults since childhood..

670
01:26:13,045 --> 01:26:16,037
..but someone insulted
you that l couldn"t bare.

671
01:26:16,882 --> 01:26:19,874
That doesn"t mean that
For pride you"ll play with..

672
01:26:19,952 --> 01:26:22,716
""..someone"s life, destroy it.""

673
01:26:23,889 --> 01:26:28,053
""Shaka, by your strength you
can shut every ones mouths.""

674
01:26:29,828 --> 01:26:32,319
""But you cannot change
hatred to love. - No, Shanti.""

675
01:26:32,831 --> 01:26:37,165
""You don"t know them,
l know them well.""

676
01:26:38,003 --> 01:26:42,667
l know them as devils and
you think that they are Gods.

677
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:45,833
These Gods of yours
have been insulting me..

678
01:26:45,911 --> 01:26:49,278
.. in every miserable
step of my childhood. Hated me.

679
01:26:50,015 --> 01:26:52,176
You also didn"t love them.

680
01:26:53,852 --> 01:26:57,686
You"ll only get hatred from
hatred. - Okay. l hated them.

681
01:26:57,856 --> 01:26:59,687
What harm have
you done to them..

682
01:26:59,858 --> 01:27:01,689
..that they started to
throw dirt on your pride.

683
01:27:02,094 --> 01:27:06,690
You should ask yourself. Lots
of people stay in this locality.

684
01:27:06,865 --> 01:27:08,696
No one say anything to any body.

685
01:27:08,867 --> 01:27:13,031
""Shanti, even you think
that l"m a bad person.""

686
01:27:19,878 --> 01:27:23,712
Understood. You
slapped me because from..

687
01:27:23,882 --> 01:27:27,045
..today they will
not say anything to you.

688
01:27:27,219 --> 01:27:28,709
This is your misconception.

689
01:27:29,521 --> 01:27:31,648
These wolves that used
talk behind your back..

690
01:27:31,823 --> 01:27:33,154
..they will say it on your face..

691
01:27:33,225 --> 01:27:35,159
..You"ve returned
my good deeds well.

692
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:53,671
""You supported me,
served me. And today..""

693
01:27:53,845 --> 01:27:57,679
..l slapped you
in front of everyone.

694
01:27:59,851 --> 01:28:05,016
l"ll break this hand.
l"ll break this hand.

695
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:08,182
No Shanti. l wish
someone would have slapped me..

696
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:12,856
""..like this 20 years ago, so
l wouldn"t be what l"m today.""

697
01:28:14,366 --> 01:28:18,200
""Shanti, when l was 5
years old my parents died.""

698
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,703
l was orphaned and
wandering on the streets.

699
01:28:21,873 --> 01:28:24,034
l had scarred my
feet in the blazing heat.

700
01:28:24,109 --> 01:28:26,703
l was shivering
in the chilling cold.

701
01:28:26,878 --> 01:28:29,711
l was hiding in the
drainage in the rains.

702
01:28:29,815 --> 01:28:33,649
l spread my hands and
begged for aid. l didn"t get it.

703
01:28:33,819 --> 01:28:39,257
""l had tolerated everything,
but couldn"t tolerate my hunger.""

704
01:28:39,992 --> 01:28:42,984
To fill my hunger l robbed.
And got caught.

705
01:28:43,328 --> 01:28:46,661
Then l got everything.
Bread from the prison..

706
01:28:46,832 --> 01:28:49,665
""..clothes to wear,
government school to study..""

707
01:28:49,835 --> 01:28:53,669
..funds donated by the rich.
The world is very bad Shanti.

708
01:28:53,839 --> 01:28:56,672
""Whatever it gives, it
gives only after being bad.""

709
01:28:57,009 --> 01:28:58,670
Go outside and see
For yourself Shanti..

710
01:28:58,844 --> 01:29:03,679
..thousands of
children are on the streets.

711
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:07,683
Then no human will
ask for them or any God.

712
01:29:07,853 --> 01:29:09,684
And when these
flowers will turn into rocks..

713
01:29:09,855 --> 01:29:13,689
..then they will have
everything. l ask you Shanti..

714
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:16,692
""..why there is so much
inJustice, why Shanti, why?""

715
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:55,459
""come, eat your food.

781
01:41:15,847 --> 01:41:18,077
But how did all this happen?
- l Just happened.

782
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:20,174
l was coming from the street.
lnspector was asking..

783
01:41:20,251 --> 01:41:23,015
..is there a woman in Shaaka"s
house. Then what l did was..

784
01:41:23,087 --> 01:41:25,851
..l came up fast started to

change my clothes. come off.

786
01:41:33,965 --> 01:41:36,126
""Sister, come out,
The procession has left.""

787
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,638

788
01:41:46,444 --> 01:41:49,971
""Shanti, if the police
would have taken you today..""

789
01:41:50,048 --> 01:41:51,640
..the l would have
burn this whole world.

790
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:53,144
Every time he"s is talking..

791
01:41:53,217 --> 01:41:55,151
"".about violence.
Sister, make him understand.""

792
01:41:56,821 --> 01:41:59,381
""You have reached here?
What, you have started.""

793
01:42:03,828 --> 01:42:06,991
""Sister you were so
close to God, l didn"t know.""

794
01:42:07,165 --> 01:42:09,656
""My work is done. Actually
sister, the matter is that..""

795
01:42:09,834 --> 01:42:12,826
..there is a girl named Kamla.
My marriage is being..

796
01:42:12,904 --> 01:42:15,168
..arranged with her. Just pray
to God that it"ll take place soon.

797
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:17,833
Why are you ruining
some poor girls life?

798
01:42:17,909 --> 01:42:19,672
What are you saying sister?
lf l don"t do it..

799
01:42:19,844 --> 01:42:21,004
..then someone else will do it.

800
01:42:21,079 --> 01:42:23,673
""But it"s not necessary, that
person will be a thief like you.""

801
01:42:23,848 --> 01:42:26,681
She will at least live
with dignity in that house.

802
01:42:26,851 --> 01:42:29,684
What do you mean?
That l"ll not disgrace her.

803
01:42:30,788 --> 01:42:33,621
She will be disgraced with
you Sarakram. - How"s that?

804
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:36,282
After marriage if
The police arrests you..

805
01:42:36,794 --> 01:42:39,957
""..you"ll be imprisoned,
you"ll be fed at the prison.""

806
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:42,625
""But that helpless woman,
how will she survive alone?""

807
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:47,237
l"m dead. You"re right sister.
But where will l earn from?

808
01:42:47,305 --> 01:42:49,637
""l was born on the streets,
opened my eyes on the streets..""

809
01:42:49,807 --> 01:42:52,298
""..grew up on the streets,
my business is on the streets.""

810
01:42:52,376 --> 01:42:53,365
That"s why name is Sarakram.
There is nothing..

811
01:42:53,444 --> 01:42:55,639
..else for me but my business.

812
01:42:56,814 --> 01:42:58,975
Trust in God and
start some hard work.

813
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,813
Sister this also
is very hard work.

814
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:05,983
lf you want to have
some one then do good deeds.

815
01:43:06,824 --> 01:43:08,655
""l"m telling you the truth, if
you don"t stop this wrong work..""

816
01:43:08,826 --> 01:43:10,657
..then you"ll never get
that girl. - No sister.

817
01:43:10,828 --> 01:43:13,160
Even if you get her then
she will never be close to you.

818
01:43:13,231 --> 01:43:15,256
Don"t say like this sister.
l can leave everything..

819
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:16,994
..but l cannot leave Kamala.

820
01:43:17,835 --> 01:43:20,167
""Then, swear by God
in front of me that..""

821
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:22,172
..you"ll leave
this business forever.

822
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:25,673
""Okay, l swear. l"ll leave
this business forever.""

823
01:43:25,843 --> 01:43:27,674
But Kamla will
Be mine. Won"t she?

824
01:43:27,845 --> 01:43:29,676
Trust in God. - ln God?

825
01:43:30,781 --> 01:43:32,942
""God, are you listening?
Sister has said everything.""

826
01:43:33,017 --> 01:43:36,953
""My work..my work will be done?
Okay, it"ll be done.""

827
01:43:42,793 --> 01:43:45,626
He has taken the girl
As well as the goods.

828
01:43:45,796 --> 01:43:48,128
l"ve never thought
in my dreams that..

829
01:43:48,199 --> 01:43:49,632
..Shaaka would betray you.

830
01:43:50,801 --> 01:43:52,632
Where would he be
able to go by betraying me?

831
01:43:53,804 --> 01:43:56,295
""Boss, now what will
happen to that necklace?""

832
01:44:01,812 --> 01:44:03,302
lmmediately call Shaaka here.

833
01:44:04,815 --> 01:44:08,251
""But listen, he
shouldn"t know anything else.""

834
01:44:24,835 --> 01:44:28,066
How many times have l
told you? l don"t like this.

835
01:44:29,140 --> 01:44:33,668
l know. l also know that
you love Shaaka very much.

836
01:44:34,845 --> 01:44:37,678
""But Rita,
Sometimes l think that..""

837
01:44:37,848 --> 01:44:41,011
lf Shaaka leaves you and
falls in love with some..

838
01:44:41,085 --> 01:44:43,679
..other woman
then what will you do?

839
01:44:46,857 --> 01:44:49,849
My name is Rita. You
must have understood by now.

840
01:45:08,045 --> 01:45:11,310
Have you eaten?
- l"ll eat after my prayers.

841
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,832
There is nothing for you to
eat. - Today l"m on a fast.

842
01:45:51,856 --> 01:45:53,414
Boss has called you.

843
01:45:55,192 --> 01:45:57,956
You wait for me downstairs.
l"ll change my clothes and come.

844
01:46:06,871 --> 01:46:09,032
l"m going out. You eat the food.

845
01:46:25,122 --> 01:46:27,056
What happened? Have a seat.

846
01:46:27,325 --> 01:46:29,452
Since you have returned from
your last Job you didn"t meet us.

847
01:46:31,996 --> 01:46:34,658
We did some thing wrong
or what? - Nothing like that.

848
01:46:41,839 --> 01:46:44,672
When you were banished
then you visited everyday..

849
01:46:44,842 --> 01:46:47,834
..now you are free
and you don"t show up.

850
01:46:47,912 --> 01:46:52,008
Without you the charm of
this hotel has disappeared.

851
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:55,348
""Here, have a drink. - Let it be.""

852
01:46:55,853 --> 01:46:59,414
l understood. We are not Rita.
You"ll drink by her hands only.

853
01:46:59,490 --> 01:47:05,087
""Babu, go and call Rita.
Love is a great thing.""

854
01:47:06,030 --> 01:47:08,692
Why did you call me? - l"ll Tell
you. l"ll tell you everything.

855
01:47:08,866 --> 01:47:10,697

Be seated comfortably.

857
01:47:27,885 --> 01:47:30,649
Do you see this necklace?

858
01:47:30,821 --> 01:47:33,654
..giving this to her
daughter in her marriage.

859
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:43,163
""Scared? Strange,
Shaaka is scared.""

860
01:47:45,169 --> 01:47:50,664
lt"s worth 20 lacs. 10
lacs is yours and 10 lacs ours.

861
01:48:03,854 --> 01:48:06,345
Go. l don"t
want to speak to you.

862
01:48:06,857 --> 01:48:08,688
""Rita, you have come
at a very good time.""

863
01:48:09,026 --> 01:48:11,688
Soon Shaaka is going to
Be very rich in one night.

864
01:48:11,862 --> 01:48:16,697
""Then Shaaka will have a
bungalow, cars, servants..""

865
01:48:16,867 --> 01:48:19,028
..Shaaka will be
living like a king.

866
01:48:19,103 --> 01:48:20,195
How"s that Boss?

867
01:48:21,105 --> 01:48:23,039
You see this
necklace it"s worth 20 lacs.

868
01:48:23,207 --> 01:48:25,698

869
01:48:28,879 --> 01:48:31,313
When should it be done?
- Tomorrow night.

870
01:48:40,825 --> 01:48:42,816
Tomorrow this
necklace will be in our hands..

871
01:48:43,828 --> 01:48:45,318
..and Shaaka will be in prison.

872
01:48:53,838 --> 01:48:56,329
Where are you going? - To rob.

873
01:48:57,174 --> 01:49:00,666
Why? - You feed me and
remain hungry yourself.

874
01:49:00,845 --> 01:49:02,676
""Shanti, l can"t
see you starving.""

875
01:49:02,847 --> 01:49:04,178
lf you have such
concern for my hunger..

876
01:49:04,248 --> 01:49:05,681
..then why don"t you
do what l want you to do?

877
01:49:05,850 --> 01:49:10,014
What do you want? - l
want your hard earned money.

878
01:49:11,288 --> 01:49:13,848
Today a man is
respected by his money.

879
01:49:14,024 --> 01:49:15,685
And from hard work you
don"t earn enough money.

880
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:17,691
l will not let
you go. l don"t need..

881
01:49:17,862 --> 01:49:19,693
..money or food
of such earned money.

882
01:49:19,864 --> 01:49:21,855
""Shanti, let me go
For the last time.""

883
01:49:21,932 --> 01:49:24,196
l promise you after
this l"ll leave everything.

884
01:49:24,268 --> 01:49:26,361
""This house, this business,
this locality.""

885
01:49:26,437 --> 01:49:29,702
""We"ll go someplace far away,
where no one knows us.""

886
01:49:29,807 --> 01:49:32,298
""No, l don"t want
any of that happiness.""

887
01:49:32,376 --> 01:49:35,641
""Stolen clothes, stolen house,
stolen bread, and stolen life.""

888
01:49:35,813 --> 01:49:38,646
For your happiness you
ruin someone else"s life..

889
01:49:38,816 --> 01:49:41,979
..l don"t want such happiness.
l don"t want such bread that..

890
01:49:42,052 --> 01:49:43,986
..has someone"s
cries and cries in it.

891
01:49:44,054 --> 01:49:46,147
Shanti let me go
For the last time.

892
01:49:46,223 --> 01:49:47,656
l"ll not get an
opportunity like this again.

893

l promise you in front of God.
- Even l taken an oath.

894
01:49:51,829 --> 01:49:54,662

whole life with you but..

895
01:49:54,832 --> 01:49:57,392
""..l won"t eat such bread.
l won"t, l won"t.""

896
01:49:57,468 --> 01:49:59,663
""Shanti, no one
can stop me toady.""

897
01:49:59,837 --> 01:50:03,329
l"ll go and
definitely go. Get out of my way.

898
01:50:03,841 --> 01:50:06,002
""l said, get out. Get out, shanti.""

899
01:50:09,847 --> 01:50:13,681
""lf this is your decision,
then go. But remember this..""

900
01:50:13,851 --> 01:50:16,411
""..when you return, you
won"t find me here. - No Shanti.""

901
01:50:16,854 --> 01:50:19,687
Don"t say such things. l
won"t be able to live without you.

902
01:50:19,857 --> 01:50:22,690
""Lies, lies all lies.""

903
01:50:22,860 --> 01:50:25,693
""You don"t love anybody,
what ever you are doing..""

904
01:50:25,863 --> 01:50:28,696
..you are doing it for your
own selfishness and not for me.

905
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,631
Listen to me. - Don"t touch me.

906
01:50:31,802 --> 01:50:33,633
Listen to me. - Leave me.

909
01:50:43,814 --> 01:50:45,645
Help! Fire!

910
01:50:47,818 --> 01:50:50,651
Mother!

911
01:52:53,811 --> 01:52:56,644
""Shanti, l didn"t steal.""

912
01:52:56,814 --> 01:52:59,647
""Shaaka, what happened to you?""

913
01:53:03,821 --> 01:53:04,810
The Job was not done.

914
01:53:05,823 --> 01:53:08,155
Shaaka couldn"t steal. He got
burned before he could steal.

915
01:53:08,826 --> 01:53:11,818
""Burnt, How? -
His locality was on fire.""

916
01:53:11,895 --> 01:53:14,455
To save a child he
got terribly burned.

917
01:53:15,833 --> 01:53:16,993
What has happened to this man?

918
01:53:17,835 --> 01:53:19,666
l don"t understand how did
this girl change him so much?

919
01:53:19,837 --> 01:53:21,065
Now what will happen?

920
01:53:21,271 --> 01:53:24,832
l couldn"t get more information
because the inspector was there.

921
01:53:25,476 --> 01:53:30,778
""Listen, Rita shouldn"t
come to know about this.""

922
01:53:42,126 --> 01:53:44,117
There is no
hope of his survival.

923
01:53:47,798 --> 01:53:53,634
Please someone
Tell me how"s my son?

924
01:53:53,804 --> 01:53:56,796
""The doctor says, that there
is no hope of his survival.""

925
01:54:07,818 --> 01:54:11,049
Pray to God. Only
prayers can save him.

926
01:54:14,825 --> 01:54:19,159
""c"mon every one, leave
For their homes. c"mon.""

02:00:06,843 --> 02:00:09,835
Why are you crying? - no.

944
02:00:11,848 --> 02:00:14,180
What did all this happen?

945
02:00:18,855 --> 02:00:23,849
These evil hands have
been purified by being burnt.

946
02:00:28,865 --> 02:00:29,957
""O, she"s dead!""

947
02:00:45,815 --> 02:00:49,148
She has been praying the whole
night after Shaka"s burning.

""Please take my life,

""Poorthing, She died by her self.""

950
02:00:59,829 --> 02:01:00,818
What happened Shanti?

951
02:01:03,833 --> 02:01:04,993
The blind mother has expired.

952
02:01:05,835 --> 02:01:12,832
No! No! Mother!

953
02:01:19,015 --> 02:01:21,677

When you know..

""..everything, why are
you not arresting Shaaka?""

955
02:01:25,088 --> 02:01:27,283
l can arrest him
whenever we want.

956
02:01:27,357 --> 02:01:29,188
Where will he run
away from the police?

957
02:01:30,293 --> 02:01:34,024
l see that this woman has
changed Shaaka immensely.

958

l am giving him a
chance to mend his ways.

But please ask the brother.
Yes my younger brother.

962
02:02:00,824 --> 02:02:01,984
He is God incarnate.

963
02:02:02,993 --> 02:02:04,654
Ever since the
plague had struck..

964
02:02:04,828 --> 02:02:06,659
..we have been staying with him.

..not to call me
while l"m exercising.

973
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:35,280

l think l"ve seen him somewhere.

981
02:03:15,832 --> 02:03:17,663
Maybe in some arena.

982
02:03:17,834 --> 02:03:21,668
""O, you keep the
hobby of wrestling too?""

983
02:03:21,838 --> 02:03:23,669
Sometimes l Just wrestle.

02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:24,670
Excellent!

985

What are you doing?
Don"t you like him?

986

Hey say something
with your mouth too.

Have you seen his eyes?

988
02:03:48,965 --> 02:03:51,297
What has happened to his eyes?
They are all right.

989
02:03:55,805 --> 02:03:58,638
What"s right in them? The
market here can be seen there.

990
02:03:59,442 --> 02:04:01,637
l don"t like the boy at all.

991
02:04:01,811 --> 02:04:03,142
Why would you like him?

992
02:04:03,813 --> 02:04:08,375
You want to tie my flower like
girl to that rich old BaJrang.

993
02:04:08,451 --> 02:04:11,818
Brother! Don"t say useless matter
- l can understand everything.

994
02:04:12,455 --> 02:04:14,150
We are leaving on your food.

995
02:04:14,824 --> 02:04:17,657
Therefore you can"t
like the boy whom we like.

996
02:04:17,827 --> 02:04:21,820
Brother! - l

997
02:04:21,898 --> 02:04:24,662
""But remember, while l am alive..""

""Sister, you have
starved me since..""

1019
02:05:55,859 --> 02:05:57,690
..you have given me
a vow. l am starving.

""Sister, do l look like a thief?""

02:06:08,104 --> 02:06:09,366
Why is he sleeping till now?

""God has given him a rebirth.
He was burnt. - burnt, how?""

1027
02:06:24,888 --> 02:06:28,051
There was a fire in the
locality. While saving a boy..

1028
02:06:29,826 --> 02:06:31,657
He does such selfless work.

1029

There is nothing to eat?

1034
02:07:03,860 --> 02:07:07,023
Don"t worry. Your
brother is alive yet.

1035
02:07:08,865 --> 02:07:09,695
Brother!

The doctor has refused.
Take this medicine.

1040
02:07:42,832 --> 02:07:45,665

l am very hungry.

1043
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:52,398
But where did you
bring all this from?

1044
02:07:52,475 --> 02:07:53,669
From the shop!

1045
02:07:53,843 --> 02:07:55,174
But you didn"t have any money.

1046
02:07:55,244 --> 02:07:56,404
What about money.
lt is in someone"s

1047
02:07:56,479 --> 02:07:58,674
""..wallet in the morning, and
someone else"s in the evening.""

1048
02:07:58,848 --> 02:08:00,338
Money is magic.

1049
02:08:00,850 --> 02:08:02,010
You stole again!

1050
02:08:02,852 --> 02:08:03,841
What are you talking about?

1051

1053
02:08:07,857 --> 02:08:09,688
""Actually, l stole from a man.""

1054
02:08:09,859 --> 02:08:11,690
l put a letter in his wallet..

1055
02:08:11,861 --> 02:08:13,852
..that l will return
it to him in 15 days.

1056
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:17,696

purse and write a letter to him.

1057
02:08:17,867 --> 02:08:20,358
l will return all their money in
the end. Our credit will go on.

1058
02:08:21,037 --> 02:08:24,200
The poison that l had
thrown away from my house..

1059
02:08:24,273 --> 02:08:27,868
""..you have brought it back again?
Lift all this, and take it.""

1060
02:08:27,944 --> 02:08:29,707
""l don"t want it. - What
are you talking about, sister?""

1061
02:08:30,813 --> 02:08:32,303
You have betrayed my faith.

1062
02:08:35,818 --> 02:08:38,651
No sister. Even l
feel like crying.

1063
02:08:38,821 --> 02:08:41,813
""Okay, l will give
back this material.""

1064
02:08:44,827 --> 02:08:48,388
She is strange. She
should have worked in the police.

1065
02:08:48,464 --> 02:08:49,658
There would not be any thieves.

1066
02:08:50,833 --> 02:08:52,994
First she used to nag
and stopped the business.

1067
02:08:53,069 --> 02:08:56,061
""Now she tells us to
return the materials, okay.""

1068
02:08:56,839 --> 02:08:59,000
What if l"m caught
while returning the goods?

1069
02:09:00,276 --> 02:09:01,834
There is not
other way left. come.

We will die starving..

02:09:09,852 --> 02:09:11,843
..but won"t eat
the bread of pity.

1072
02:09:11,921 --> 02:09:16,483
""No, You can"t starve till
The time we are there.""

1073
02:09:16,859 --> 02:09:20,852
""Yes, - Bring the goods, keep
them inside. Keep them inside.""

1074
02:09:29,806 --> 02:09:32,639
""Moove here, - What is happening?""

1075
02:09:32,809 --> 02:09:35,972
""Sister, we know everything.""

1076
02:09:37,814 --> 02:09:39,145
Please don"t be scared.

1077
02:09:40,817 --> 02:09:41,806
How are you?

l"m fine. How"s child?

1079
02:09:45,822 --> 02:09:48,655
She"s well. She was
forcing us to take her with us.

1080
02:09:48,825 --> 02:09:50,986
l didn"t bring her.
She has become very weak.

1081
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:54,655
""Sister, if you need
anything else, Just tell us.""

1082
02:09:54,831 --> 02:09:57,664
Yes. Think of us as your own.

1083
02:09:57,834 --> 02:09:58,994
""We are your own, dear.""

1084
02:09:59,168 --> 02:09:59,657
You are standing here..

1085
02:09:59,836 --> 02:10:03,670
""..and talking, go inside and
make "chappatis",go do your works.""

1086
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:06,673
""Speak softly, - l will speak
softly, but you do your work.""

1087
02:10:24,861 --> 02:10:29,025
Take this offering.
By God"s mercy..

1088
02:10:29,799 --> 02:10:32,290
..there are not even
burn marks on your hands.

1089
02:10:32,802 --> 02:10:35,362
You have cleared off
The blots on my heart.

1090
02:10:35,438 --> 02:10:37,303
How will the scars
On my hands stay then?

1091
02:10:37,807 --> 02:10:38,637
Please give me the offering.

1092
02:10:55,825 --> 02:10:57,656
"lt"s Holi!"

1093
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:15,675
"Holi has brought
thousands of colors."

1094
02:11:19,015 --> 02:11:23,679
"Some for the mind
and some for the body."

1095
02:11:55,818 --> 02:12:00,653
"Some single men are
filling their water pistols."

1096
02:12:05,461 --> 02:12:09,659
"Some are coloring
with excited eyes."

1097

"""Some wet bodies,
and dancing minds."""

"""Look at these colors,
how they have come up."""

1102
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:55,635
"""For the eyes, they
are putting up scenes."""

1103

No - What happened?

1110
02:16:51,847 --> 02:16:54,839
Maybe she isn"t playing
Holi because of your sickness.

1111
02:16:55,084 --> 02:16:57,678
""Please forgive us,
Please forgive us.""

Shanti!

02:17:22,878 --> 02:17:29,215
lt is the color of your mind.
Maybe this was God"s wishes.

l know that l am not worth you.

1115

l even know that l am
saying what l shouldn"t.

1116
02:17:40,162 --> 02:17:43,654
l swear that l will
walk the path that you lead..

1117
02:17:43,832 --> 02:17:47,165
..and will serve
you throughout my life.

""Yes, quickly! See. - Boss!""

1120
02:18:01,850 --> 02:18:03,681
l didn"t have
These hopes of you.

1121
02:18:04,853 --> 02:18:08,016
Shaaka got burnt and
you didn"t even tell me.

1122
02:18:13,862 --> 02:18:16,695
""Rita, Many things
are better not said.""

1123
02:18:16,865 --> 02:18:18,025
l didn"t understand.

lt is better if
you don"t understand

1125
02:18:20,869 --> 02:18:22,700
This was not the
answer to my question.

1126
02:18:25,374 --> 02:18:29,208
""Rita, l have hidden
Many things like these.""

1127
02:18:29,812 --> 02:18:30,801
Which things?

1128
02:18:31,814 --> 02:18:33,304
l will tell them when
the right time comes.

1129
02:18:34,149 --> 02:18:37,676
What about time. l will
myself go to Shaaka and find out.

1130
02:18:38,988 --> 02:18:41,980
Rita! lt won"t be
good if you go there.

""Shaaka! What happened
to you, are you all right?""

1133
02:19:27,036 --> 02:19:30,631
The Boss is a very bad man.
He didn"t tell me anything.

1134
02:19:31,974 --> 02:19:33,032
Please forgive me.

1135

You wretch

1146
02:20:16,852 --> 02:20:18,683
Don"t make noise.
People will gather.

1147
02:20:18,854 --> 02:20:20,287
l will kill him.

1148
02:20:20,356 --> 02:20:21,687
""lf the police come to know,

1149
02:20:21,857 --> 02:20:24,690
""Leave me Boss, l will kill her.""

1150
02:20:24,860 --> 02:20:26,691

will tell you everything.

1151
02:20:44,813 --> 02:20:46,144
""Take the car back, Driver.""

1152
02:21:12,841 --> 02:21:17,005
Shanti. You know what l was.

1153
02:21:17,846 --> 02:21:19,177
You know what l am.

1154
02:21:20,849 --> 02:21:24,683
lf the rock from the
road is put up in a temple..

1155
02:21:24,853 --> 02:21:27,014
..then he has no other
shelter other than the temple.

1156
02:21:28,090 --> 02:21:29,682
Don"t think that l am wrong.

1157
02:21:30,793 --> 02:21:35,127
l have full faith in you.

1158
02:21:36,799 --> 02:21:37,629

he should come immediately.

1160
02:21:50,813 --> 02:21:53,646
Whatever it is. The
girl was very beautiful.

1161
02:21:53,816 --> 02:21:57,650
That serpent will
be at your place.

1162
02:21:59,988 --> 02:22:00,647
Ramu has come.

1163
02:22:11,834 --> 02:22:12,994
Greetings sir!

1164
02:22:14,169 --> 02:22:15,659
Have you made him
understand everything?

1165
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:19,330
Have you understood everything?

1166
02:22:20,843 --> 02:22:22,674
My profession is to understand.

1167
02:22:28,851 --> 02:22:34,949
""This is to pick up
the girl, to stop Shaaka.""

1168
02:22:35,791 --> 02:22:37,782
You will get more
When the work is done.

1169
02:22:41,964 --> 02:22:43,295
can l have a cigarette?

1170
02:22:48,303 --> 02:22:49,964
There are people out there too.

1171
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:58,302
Listen. Nothing
should happen to Shaka.

1172
02:23:25,274 --> 02:23:27,674
Where is Shanti?

1173
02:23:27,843 --> 02:23:28,673
l am Shanti. What is it?

1174
02:23:28,844 --> 02:23:30,607
Shaka was working in the rocks.

1175
02:23:30,779 --> 02:23:33,111
The rock fell on his leg.
His leg has become useless.

1176
02:23:34,116 --> 02:23:36,949
He is taking his last
breaths and calling you.

1177
02:23:37,786 --> 02:23:39,617
Take me to him. Take me to him.

1178
02:23:39,788 --> 02:23:40,618
Please come.

1179
02:23:51,133 --> 02:23:54,625
Where is she going?
What has happened?

1180
02:24:24,333 --> 02:24:30,670
""One, two, three, four
Rupee and seventy five paise.""

1181
02:25:19,888 --> 02:25:21,116
Our account is not done too.

1182
02:25:21,890 --> 02:25:22,720
Will you not complete it?

1183
02:25:23,892 --> 02:25:25,723
l have finished
all accounts now.

1184
02:25:25,894 --> 02:25:27,054
You have finished them?

1185
02:25:32,834 --> 02:25:34,665
l have Just started it.

1186
02:25:35,837 --> 02:25:37,668
l have left this
business forever.

1187
02:25:37,839 --> 02:25:39,670
You leave it too.

1188
02:25:40,842 --> 02:25:41,672
Should l leave it?

1189
02:25:41,843 --> 02:25:43,174
Yes.
- Okay go.

1190
02:25:51,186 --> 02:25:52,676
""Shamu, let me go home.""

1191
02:25:52,854 --> 02:25:54,685
She has not eaten
anything since many days.

1192
02:25:54,856 --> 02:25:57,017
""See, l have earned money..""

1193
02:26:01,863 --> 02:26:05,697
Shamu! You ruined
my hard earned money!

1194
02:26:26,888 --> 02:26:28,219
Give me. Give me my labor!

1195
02:26:28,890 --> 02:26:29,720
""Shaaka, leave me!""

1196
02:26:29,825 --> 02:26:32,658
Wait Shaaka. The boss
must have taken her away.

1197
02:26:32,828 --> 02:26:34,659
Who? - The one whom
you gave your money to.

1198
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:35,660
What are you saying?

1199
02:26:35,831 --> 02:26:37,321
Really. Go home and see.

1200
02:26:50,846 --> 02:26:54,680
Shanti! Shanti!

1201
02:27:05,861 --> 02:27:06,691
Where is Shanti!

1202
02:27:06,862 --> 02:27:09,194
She was running
Away with some man.

1203
02:27:09,264 --> 02:27:10,697
All of us saw her. - yes!

1204
02:27:15,871 --> 02:27:17,702
He had gone behind her.

1205
02:27:18,039 --> 02:27:19,700
Maybe he wishes
to say something.

1206
02:27:25,881 --> 02:27:27,212
What happen? - come with me.

1207
02:27:33,054 --> 02:27:34,646
Where is she? Where
is my daughter in law?

1208
02:27:38,827 --> 02:27:40,658
l had told you.
No one can steal..

1209
02:27:40,829 --> 02:27:42,820
""..my Shaka from me,
till l"m alive.""

1210
02:27:42,898 --> 02:27:48,666
Wretch! l will finish
your dignity and life.

1211
02:27:48,837 --> 02:27:50,668
come on.

1212
02:27:55,844 --> 02:27:57,835
No! - What no?

1213
02:28:15,864 --> 02:28:20,699
""l wanted to see, what
is so special in you..""

1214
02:28:21,870 --> 02:28:24,031
..that you changed Shaka.

1215
02:28:27,108 --> 02:28:28,040
What charms!

1216
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:39,980
Where will you run away?

1217

Place where one doesn"t..

1222
02:29:09,851 --> 02:29:13,685
""Rita wants Shaka,
because she wants only Shaka.""

1223
02:29:14,856 --> 02:29:19,190
""You want Shaka, because
you need love and support.""

""Either according to
your wishes, or mine.""

1227
02:30:49,985 --> 02:30:51,646
No! Help me!

1228
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:52,650
Wait!

1229
02:30:57,826 --> 02:31:00,659
Did you think about
your life before this dare?

1230
02:31:00,829 --> 02:31:04,162
""Shaka, l have not shed
any blood since many days.""

1231
02:31:18,847 --> 02:31:21,338
Beware! Don"t
even take a step ahead.

1232
02:31:25,854 --> 02:31:26,684

02:31:52,814 --> 02:31:53,803
What did you do?

1236
02:31:57,819 --> 02:32:01,653
""Shaka, You won"t understand.""

1237
02:32:01,823 --> 02:32:03,654
l will take you to the doctor.

1238
02:32:03,825 --> 02:32:07,818

come closer to me.
come close to me. closer.

1240
02:32:27,849 --> 02:32:32,616
You wanted to
separate me from Shaka.

1241
02:32:34,789 --> 02:32:44,027
Shaka is mine. Nobody can
snatch him from me. Nobody.

1242
02:32:52,974 --> 02:32:56,137
Shaka. Jeevan Ram has
come with the police.

1243
02:32:58,813 --> 02:33:00,440
You take Shanti
from this side and go.

1244
02:33:00,815 --> 02:33:02,976
Go Shanti. - come sister.

1245
02:33:10,391 --> 02:33:13,258
""lnspector, Boss has
Killed Rita and run away.""

1246
02:33:14,829 --> 02:33:16,319
He has already
got the punishment.

1247
02:33:16,397 --> 02:33:19,161
He is the one. l recognize him.

1248
02:33:19,834 --> 02:33:22,166
Where is my daughter-in-law?

1249
02:33:22,837 --> 02:33:25,670
""Shaka, where is she?""

1250
02:33:26,174 --> 02:33:28,005
l don"t know.

1251
02:33:28,843 --> 02:33:30,105
Everything will be
Found out in the court.

1252
02:33:30,178 --> 02:33:32,009
Where is Mrs. Shanti?

1253
02:33:32,113 --> 02:33:35,105
""l am asking for the
last time, where is she?""

1254
02:33:37,785 --> 02:33:40,618
""Did you see, Judge.
Even after such coaxing..""

1255
02:33:40,788 --> 02:33:42,619
..the accused doesn"t answer.

1256
02:33:43,224 --> 02:33:46,625
l request the court
to keep this in mind..

1257
02:33:46,794 --> 02:33:49,627
..before deciding this case.

1258
02:33:49,797 --> 02:33:51,628
That the accused is
a hard core criminal.

1259
02:33:51,799 --> 02:33:55,360
""He has no feelings for
the court, law or humanity.""

1260
02:33:55,436 --> 02:33:58,963
He has done a greater
crime that theft and murder.

1261
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,634
He has kidnapped
a virtuous woman.

1262
02:34:01,809 --> 02:34:03,970
Stolen goods can be retrieved.

1263
02:34:04,145 --> 02:34:07,637
But the accused has
Stolen the dignity of a house.

1264
02:34:07,815 --> 02:34:09,146
That can never be returned.

1265
02:34:09,817 --> 02:34:12,377
The court can"t
Return the stolen dignity.

1266
02:34:12,453 --> 02:34:13,818
Therefore l
request the court to..

1267
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:16,152
..give the accused
the harshest punishment.

1268
02:34:16,224 --> 02:34:19,819
So that others tremble and
none commits such an act again

1269
02:34:22,063 --> 02:34:26,659
""Accused Shakti Singh, the
court asks you for the last time.""

1270
02:34:26,834 --> 02:34:28,165
Where is Mrs. Shanti?

1271
02:34:31,005 --> 02:34:32,336
""l am here, Mr. Judge.""

1272
02:34:34,842 --> 02:34:38,005
""My daughter-in-law,
My child, where were you?""

1273
02:34:40,014 --> 02:34:41,481
My name is Shanti.

1274
02:34:41,849 --> 02:34:46,343
""lf you permit, l would
wish to ask them something.""

1275
02:34:49,023 --> 02:34:49,853
Permitted.

1276
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:15,447
What is the relation between us?

1277
02:35:17,885 --> 02:35:18,715
Daughter in law.

1278
02:35:19,053 --> 02:35:20,714
What is the other
Name for a daughter in law.

1279
02:35:20,888 --> 02:35:21,718
Daughter.

1280
02:35:24,892 --> 02:35:26,450
What is the relation between us?

1281
02:35:26,527 --> 02:35:29,394
""Daughter in law, my child,
My dignity, my everything.""

1282
02:35:29,464 --> 02:35:30,658
The Goddess of my house.

1283
02:35:34,836 --> 02:35:36,667
""Brother in law, what is the..""

1284
02:35:36,838 --> 02:35:38,829
..relation between us?
- Sister in law.

1285
02:35:39,007 --> 02:35:41,168
What is our other relation then?

1286
02:35:42,844 --> 02:35:43,674
That of a son and a mother.

1287
02:35:43,845 --> 02:35:47,008
No. Don"t
lnsult the word mother.

1288
02:35:47,181 --> 02:35:51,345
Was l not your mother
When you tried to rape me?

1289
02:35:51,419 --> 02:35:55,685
Was l not your
dignity when l was yearning..

1290
02:35:55,857 --> 02:35:59,691
..for a drop of
water in plague?

1291
02:35:59,861 --> 02:36:01,692
When you left me for dead?

1292
02:36:01,863 --> 02:36:04,855
Was l not your
daughter-in-law when you..

1293
02:36:04,932 --> 02:36:08,026
..called me
luckless the whole day?

1294
02:36:08,102 --> 02:36:10,036
When you used to
hit me mercilessly?

1295
02:36:10,872 --> 02:36:14,035
Then what right
do you have on me?

1296
02:36:14,876 --> 02:36:17,709
l ask you. When
this brother - in - law..

1297
02:36:17,879 --> 02:36:21,713
""..wished to ruin the sacred
relation, where was mother..""

1298
02:36:21,883 --> 02:36:23,316
""..where was daughter in law,
where was daughter..""

1299
02:36:23,384 --> 02:36:24,715
..where was your respect?

1300
02:36:25,219 --> 02:36:28,711
""Judge, this man who is
very bad in your eyes..""

1301
02:36:28,890 --> 02:36:30,653
""..had not saved me, that day..""

1302
02:36:30,825 --> 02:36:34,989
""..a daughter in law,
a mother and daughter..""

1303
02:36:35,063 --> 02:36:38,829
..would have been fallen
in the eyes of the society.

1304
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:41,994
Every woman in this
World would tremble..

1305
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:44,163
..hearing the names of in-laws.

1306
02:36:44,339 --> 02:36:50,835
A woman goes to her
in-laws with hopes and dreams.

1307
02:36:51,846 --> 02:36:53,837
l had such hopes and dreams too.

1308
02:36:54,916 --> 02:37:02,015
""But, these people
insulted me and tortured me.""

1309
02:37:02,857 --> 02:37:06,486
Do you want to see
what they have given me?

1310
02:37:07,862 --> 02:37:09,693
This is what they had given me.

1311
02:37:09,864 --> 02:37:12,196
""This is their
symbol of dignity, which..""

1312
02:37:12,266 --> 02:37:14,860
..have never gone
out of my life till now.

1313
02:37:15,503 --> 02:37:19,200
""Judge sir, lf this man is bad,
Whom the lawyer..""

1314
02:37:19,273 --> 02:37:21,707
..wants to harshly punish..

1315
02:37:21,876 --> 02:37:25,209
""..if this man is bad,
in whose house..""

1316
02:37:25,279 --> 02:37:28,715
..my dignity was more
safer than my own house..

1317
02:37:28,883 --> 02:37:30,043
..then these
people who torture..

1318
02:37:30,118 --> 02:37:31,642
..the daughter-in-law
of the house and call..

1319
02:37:31,819 --> 02:37:33,810
..her mother and
daughter in the outside world..

1320
02:37:33,888 --> 02:37:34,820
..are worse.

1321
02:37:36,824 --> 02:37:40,817
""Look at this kid, ask These
locality people and lnspector.""

1322
02:37:41,062 --> 02:37:46,830
""He risked his life,
and saved her.""

1323
02:37:48,836 --> 02:37:53,000
""lf he is bad, then l
pray to God to give birth..""

1324
02:37:53,074 --> 02:37:57,340
..to bad men like
this again and again.

1325
02:37:57,412 --> 02:37:59,846
So that
innocent girls like her..

1326
02:37:59,914 --> 02:38:03,680
..and sad women like me
have their dignity intact.

1327
02:38:06,854 --> 02:38:10,688
l have never said it.
l say it today.

1328
02:38:10,858 --> 02:38:23,202
""Shaka is God, Shaka is my God.""

1329
02:38:32,146 --> 02:38:35,047
We have come to
Know that Mrs. Shanti..

1330
02:38:35,116 --> 02:38:38,142
..ran away from home
according to her own wishes.

1331
02:38:38,386 --> 02:38:41,651
But l can"t understand
what the need to steal was?

1332
02:38:41,823 --> 02:38:43,154
Whose proof is this bangle!

1333
02:38:43,825 --> 02:38:46,157
This bangle is from
that Jewelry which..

1334
02:38:46,227 --> 02:38:47,990
..the police found in his house.

1335
02:38:57,839 --> 02:39:03,835
""Since Mrs. Shanti is not in her
senses, the court is adJourned.""

1336
02:39:08,850 --> 02:39:11,683
This angles find from your house.

1337
02:39:11,853 --> 02:39:14,845
""lf you have not stolen,
where did this bangle come from?""

1338
02:39:14,922 --> 02:39:18,358
""l will tell you.
come, doctor come.""

1339
02:39:21,095 --> 02:39:24,030
""Take this Sir, count this.
- who are you?""

1340
02:39:24,098 --> 02:39:26,362
l am the physician from
the neighborhood village.

1341
02:39:26,434 --> 02:39:28,026
My husband! - set up.

1342
02:39:28,102 --> 02:39:29,694
Where did you get
This Jewelry from?

1343
02:39:29,804 --> 02:39:33,296
""Sir, when they left
the daughter in law..""

1344
02:39:33,374 --> 02:39:34,636
..l cured the daughter-in-law.

1345
02:39:34,809 --> 02:39:37,972
""When l went to see her again,
They were talking..""

1346
02:39:38,045 --> 02:39:41,981
..in hushed tones that
they will hide this somewhere..

1347
02:39:42,049 --> 02:39:43,641
..and tell the police that
this person has stolen Jewelry.

1348
02:39:43,818 --> 02:39:46,150
They said that the
police will arrest Shaka..

1349
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:47,812
..and we will get
the daughter -in-law.

1350
02:39:48,055 --> 02:39:54,654
""l married in old age, therefore
my wife didn"t love me.""

1351
02:39:56,831 --> 02:39:59,664
""Lookiing for an auspicious
time, l took the Jewels.""

1352
02:39:59,834 --> 02:40:03,668
And l cleared one bangle
out of it. Which is with you?

1353
02:40:03,838 --> 02:40:06,671
What was the need of all this?

1354
02:40:06,841 --> 02:40:10,174
Maybe because
They had come to know..

1355
02:40:10,244 --> 02:40:13,338
""..that after Shanti"s Uncle"s
death, his legacy to her..""

1356
02:40:13,414 --> 02:40:17,009
..he had left all
That is Just about near 6 Lakh.

1357
02:40:17,285 --> 02:40:18,183
Who are you?

1358
02:40:19,353 --> 02:40:22,345
l am Shanti"s Uncle
seth Kishan das" lawyer.

1359
02:40:22,857 --> 02:40:25,189
And l had gone to
their house one day.

1360
02:40:25,860 --> 02:40:28,294
They told me that she
Had gone on a pilgrimage.

1361
02:40:28,496 --> 02:40:30,964
But lnspector
Told me something else.

1362
02:40:31,799 --> 02:40:35,132
""Shanti had not gone away,
but run away from home.""

1363
02:40:41,909 --> 02:40:46,972
""Jeevan Lal, his
Wife and his son..""

1364
02:40:47,381 --> 02:40:50,646
""..who tried to fool the court,
the court orders..""

..court
proceedings against them.

1366
02:40:56,457 --> 02:41:02,157
""The physician, his wife and his
friend has accepted their crimes.""
