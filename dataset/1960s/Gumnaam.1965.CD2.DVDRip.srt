1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,034
After all, Dharamdas has proved
his innocence.

2
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,669
Looks like a strong pair of
hands choked him to death.

3
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:22,869
The murderer is one of us.

4
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:26,036
But who is he and what
is his motive?

5
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:27,636
And why isn't he facing us?

6
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,179
You look upset.
- Not really.

7
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,579
So what are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

8
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,079
Who could be
singing that song?

9
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:11,980
Who knows?
- Is it a stranger?

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,447
Do you believe in spirits?

11
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,981
What do you do in Bombay?
- Nothing.

12
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,982
What is your opinion
about the murderer?

13
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:36,482
What do you do in Bombay?
- You've evaded my question.

14
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:38,849
You haven't answered me either.

15
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:46,383
Do you always smoke cigars?
- Yes, why?

16
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:51,184
I found a piece of cigar
near Kishan's corpse.

17
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,184
Haramdas smoked cigars too.
- That's true.

18
00:02:55,284 --> 00:03:02,385
But he was killed. There's someone...
- What are you insinuating?

19
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:06,385
That I am the murderer?
- Don't feel offended.

20
00:03:07,152 --> 00:03:09,252
It's for me to dark
a shot in the darkness.

21
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,186
Who know? One might
hit the target.

22
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:15,686
Sometimes man himself
gets targeted.

23
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:30,388
I still maintain that I like
alcoholics, not alcohol.

24
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:35,655
Till we met, how did you
know about my qualities?

25
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:39,989
And this is still alien to you.
Try it and you will befriend it.

26
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,989
Isn't it enough that we're friends?
- There's safety in numbers.

27
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:47,989
Drink it. This will fulfil
all the voids in your life.

28
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,990
Why don't you say that I must
get drunk so that you will...

29
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,990
I know my way around, Rake.
I know all these tricks.

30
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,391
And suppose I don't drink it?
- Then I'll force it.

31
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:10,392
Sometimes you forget that
you are up against Kitty.

32
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,792
I've handled people like you
all my life.

33
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:16,792
Then let's see how you handle me.
C'mon, drink it.

34
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,593
It is not necessary to expose
your character to everyone.

35
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:22,893
There are decent
people living here.

36
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,793
Of course, and I've read
their names in the diary.

37
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:28,494
You had better leave.
- This is Ms. Kitty's room.

38
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:31,994
You'd better behave yourself.
- Darling, then you ask him to leave.

39
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,861
And close the door behind you.

40
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:38,328
Look, I can't tolerate
a woman being insulted.

41
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:42,395
Get out, you have no chance here.

42
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:46,862
Slowly does it... care
for your health, doctor.

43
00:04:51,696 --> 00:04:53,929
Good! That's a match!

44
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,597
What are you both upto?
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

45
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:04,497
If we fight amongst ourselves,
how will we trace the murderer?

46
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,397
Go on...
Go to your respective rooms.

47
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,298
Kitty, beware of them.

48
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:23,999
Where are you going?
Please sit for a while.

49
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,300
Poking fun at my old age?

50
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,700
I am only complimenting you.

51
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:37,600
The way you separated them
was really commendable.

52
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,801
I mean, for a person of your age.

53
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,201
I've always had this bad habit...
- Pardon me?

54
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,301
I've always been fond
of exercising.

55
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:50,068
Perhaps that's why age has
not reduced your vigour.

56
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:59,203
Seeing your strength,
I'm tempted to befriend you.

57
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:02,403
So that even if I'm attacked,
I can be saved.

58
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:05,537
It is our duty to help each other.

59
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:27,705
You?

60
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:37,606
Why have you come here?
- To know about Dharamdas' death.

61
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:40,007
I've already told you.

62
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:42,407
A strong pair of hands
choked him to death.

63
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:46,874
Strangulation wouldn't have
turned the body blue, doctor.

64
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:52,475
Dharamdas did not die
of strangulation...

65
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:56,808
someone has poisoned him.
- I myself examined the body.

66
00:06:57,308 --> 00:06:59,209
I'm a doctor,
I can't be mistaken.

67
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:02,109
If you are a doctor,
I too am a criminal lawyer.

68
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,809
I've been practicing
law for 15 years.

69
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:07,209
I've sent many guilty men
to the gallows.

70
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,677
What do you mean?
- My doubts are now confirmed...

71
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,410
that the murderer is one of us.

72
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,310
You may take another look
at Dharamdas' dead body.

73
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,011
The crime will itself reveal
who the perpetrator is!

74
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:41,613
What is the matter?
- Who killed Dharamdas?

75
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,013
What's the point in worrying
about those who are dead?

76
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,347
Let's worry about those
who are alive.

77
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:52,481
The old man is right. Instead of
others, worry about yourselves.

78
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,881
Worry about yourselves...
worry about me!

79
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,614
Go and attend to your work.
- I'm doing my work, all right.

80
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,815
What is your opinion
about the butler?

81
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:08,482
He's a harmless fellow.

82
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:11,683
But there is surely
someone behind all this.

83
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:16,816
That's true.
- How do we get to the murderer?

84
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:18,917
Right. How do we get
to the murderer?

85
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:37,618
Madame, what are you doing
in the kitchen?

86
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,019
I wanted to know the menu.

87
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,486
The menu is prawn
curry with rice.

88
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,820
My black colour on a fair skin
is considered a beauty spot.

89
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,621
But any white on my dark skin
is considered a disease.

90
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:05,321
Oh my sweet heart!

91
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:10,422
There is no dearth of beauties.

92
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:12,522
I'll managee with my dreams.

93
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:16,489
My dreams...

94
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:19,253
Oh God, I've made a mess
of my kitchen.

95
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,253
How will I feed
the free-loaders now?

96
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:32,854
May I ask you something, Anand?
- Go ahead.

97
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:38,921
I have a feeling you are
not what you appear to be.

98
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:42,455
But you should know that I'm
not what you suspect either.

99
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:44,855
That's just what I want to know...
who are you?

100
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:46,955
Who are you?

101
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:52,523
Why must you need an introduction?
I'm the one you had scolded!

102
00:14:53,356 --> 00:14:54,156
Stop joking.

103
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:56,856
What else can I do?

104
00:14:58,423 --> 00:15:00,523
Every moment spent in fun
is well spent.

105
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:04,857
Life is quite meaningless now.

106
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:09,658
There's the fear of death
at every step.

107
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,525
I wasn't afraid
when I came here.

108
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,758
I wasn't much scared even after
knowing the contents of the diary.

109
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:20,525
I didn't attach much
importance to death.

110
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:22,926
But now...
- My company makes you a coward?

111
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:25,659
No.
I don't want to die now.

112
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:31,727
I am not alone.
- I'll protect you from all harm.

113
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:34,127
But there is no way of escape.

114
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,861
I think we'll finally
suffocate to death.

115
00:15:41,694 --> 00:15:47,261
Death will have to deal with me
before reaching you.

116
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:01,663
No one had any inkling of
this whilst leaving Bombay.

117
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,530
All this is a coincidence.

118
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:08,063
And incidentally,
we may even survive this.

119
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,464
I hope so!
- But we'll always be together.

120
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:24,065
What happened?
- Nothing.

121
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,065
Go on home.
- Are you going somewhere?

122
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:31,266
I'll just check everything.

123
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,870
You?
- No Kitty, sir... his is male!

124
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,970
You're mistaken.

125
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,870
It was me washing the clothes.

126
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,871
Ain't I a clever guy?
- Oh God!

127
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:28,071
Sir, can I tell you something?
- Speak up.

128
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,472
Give up drinking.
It's an awful thing!

129
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:32,072
Have you ever tasted it
or are you just abusing it?

130
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:37,672
My father was an ace drunkard.

131
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,673
My veins have more
alcohol than blood.

132
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:43,273
No wonder your face
is like this.

133
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,373
Come here!

134
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:51,274
Why is the doctor so frantic?
- Someone has murdered Mr. Sharma.

135
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:14,176
The contents of the diary
were true afterall.

136
00:18:15,243 --> 00:18:17,676
The letter says, don't grieve
Mr. Sharma's death.

137
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:20,877
Because he had planned
Mr. Sohanlal's death.

138
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:24,544
I don't get this...
There's no one here besides us.

139
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,678
I think one amongst you men
is the murderer.

140
00:18:30,978 --> 00:18:34,145
You left yourself out.
Perhaps you too...

141
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,678
How can you say such things?
Had I wanted to kill you all...

142
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,879
couldn't I have
poisoned your food?

143
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,746
Maybe you don't possess
the poison.

144
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:48,079
Well said! When I could arrange
for the food...

145
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,180
when I could bring
buffalos for milk...

146
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,580
couldn't I've arranged
for the poison?

147
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,747
Don't you doubt me. The earlier
ones died after a hearty meal.

148
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,680
But the rest of you
will die of starvation.

149
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,081
I won't cook for you!

150
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:03,748
She was only joking.
You could never kill alone.

151
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:06,481
Lay the food.
- That's a nice joke!

152
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:09,382
The food isn't ready yet.
I'll bring it, when it's ready.

153
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:23,750
You were right, Anand.
One of us is surely the murderer.

154
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,550
You, Anand or the doctor?
- Perhaps!

155
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,984
We must search each other's room.

156
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,684
And discard any weapon found.

157
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:37,684
I've no objection
to my room being searched.

158
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:41,351
You can gladly search
my room too.

159
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:43,752
What will we find in your room?
- Where else?

160
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,352
How was Mr. Sharma killed?

161
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:51,753
You have not answered me.
- What do you mean?

162
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,953
The pick-ax used to kill Mr.
Sharma was in your possession.

163
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,553
I've no pick-ax
in my possession.

164
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:59,287
I myself saw you hiding it.

165
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:04,087
Even when caught red handed, a
thief doesn't accept his crimes.

166
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,487
Why are you silent?
Answer him, Mr. Rakesh.

167
00:20:07,787 --> 00:20:09,688
Even if that were true...

168
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,088
but then how was
Dharamdas killed?

169
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:14,955
By a pick-ax? No!
He was poisoned.

170
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:17,355
And only the doctor
had that poison.

171
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:19,755
The empty bottle of which be
hid in the vase that night.

172
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:22,489
This is a lie.
I have not poisoned anyone!

173
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,589
I admit, I did
have the poison.

174
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:29,690
So too, I am innocent...
though I did have a pick ax.

175
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:50,958
No reason for that.
Why should I feel offended?

176
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,692
So you are mourning
Mr. Sharma's death?

177
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:57,359
What nonsense! With you around,
I won't grieve even my own death.

178
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,093
But are you alive?
- Only outwardly.

179
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,993
Actually, I died the day
you called me Rake.

180
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:09,360
But you haven't get
accepted my love.

181
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:17,094
You too haven't seen
through someone.

182
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,361
So have a drink today...
for my sake.

183
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:25,362
For your sake?
Okay, I'll have it.

184
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,963
Do you really love me?

185
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:43,764
I've never spoken the truth.
But when I do, I mean it.

186
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:47,297
I don't understand this.
What did that letter mean...

187
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:50,498
that we shouldn't grieve
Mr. Sharma's death...

188
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:53,698
because he had master minded
Mr. Sohanlal's death?

189
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:56,565
That's a lie! I feel the
conspirator was someone else.

190
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:59,765
You are right.
- But who is he?

191
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,499
Some one.
- How can you be so sure?

192
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,900
Because I was Mr. Sohanlal's
private secretary.

193
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:10,966
Isee. So that's
how it is!

194
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:16,567
I think a drink more will
loosen your tongue further.

195
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,367
It was I who sent that will to you
for alternations. Understood?

196
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:25,701
No.
- You too need a peg to comprehend.

197
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:28,902
So darling, it means...
- Everything happens for the best.

198
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:34,169
Life is a gift and to find
a confidante is a real boon!

199
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:37,402
We are sailing
in the same boat.

200
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:41,703
Think it over!
You too may not drown.

201
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:44,570
I don't care.
- Then let's leave it to fate.

202
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:44,927
Hey butler, come here.
- I'm coming.

203
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:57,428
Where were you going?
- Where can I go, sir?

204
00:26:59,562 --> 00:27:02,996
But what are you doing here?
- I was taking some photographs.

205
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,596
What?
- Photographs.

206
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:07,029
Take some of mine too.
- Why?

207
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:08,596
It will please my sister.
- How?

208
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:11,563
My sister has seen a girl for me.
- What?

209
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,997
If I send her my picture,
she'll perform the marriage.

210
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:18,997
Even if I click your picture,
it will remain in the camera.

211
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:22,198
Why?
- No developing facilities.

212
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:25,731
What is that?
- Washing the film.

213
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:28,932
Oh God, does one wash
the photographs?

214
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:34,532
But how will you send your
photograph to your sister?

215
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:36,932
There are no postal
services here.

216
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:44,133
Weren't the pigeons better couriers?
- That's true!

217
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:49,734
But cameras didn't exist earlier.
- That's true!

218
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,035
Can I smoke?
- Sure.

219
00:28:01,702 --> 00:28:08,936
What did you do in Bombay?
- I was a butler there, not Hitler.

220
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:14,203
How did you come here?
- In a boat.

221
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:19,337
Alone?
- Two buffaloes accompanied me.

222
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,937
That boatman saw us off
with our luggage and left.

223
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,604
Who, in your opinion,
is the murderer?

224
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:32,138
Well, sir...? Trying to trap me
with this cigarette?

225
00:28:32,238 --> 00:28:33,738
I just asked.
- I don't know anything.

226
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:42,539
Sir, now that your girlfriend
is coming, I'll go my way.

227
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,940
Seeing your wet clothes...

228
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,607
I think you've taken great
pains to find me.

229
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,141
True. Anand, I came to
give you some news.

230
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:03,341
What?
- Rakesh and Kitty are marrying.

231
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:08,608
Had a marriage been possible here,
we too won't remain bachelors.

232
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:12,942
There is no means of
getting married here.

233
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,142
Though one can romance and
make a commitment.

234
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:19,343
They've decided to get married
on reaching Bombay.

235
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,210
Only if they survive
this ordeal!

236
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,343
Who knows who's turn it is
to die today?

237
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:31,344
Isn't it possible that Rakesh
is the murderer?

238
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:36,944
Perhaps that is what makes
Kitty so care free today.

239
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:43,012
He will die.
He too will be murdered.

240
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:44,612
How can you be so sure?

241
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:51,813
Who will kill him?
Are you hinting at the doctor?

242
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:55,813
I think all of us will
be murdered.

243
00:29:56,113 --> 00:29:58,547
Don't say such things, Anand.
I feel scared.

244
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:03,347
No need to worry. No one will
harm Mr. Sohanlal's niece.

245
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:07,814
Because what will happen to
the property after her death?

246
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,248
You won't die, Asha!

247
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:14,215
What are you saying?
You speak as if...

248
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:16,948
Yes, I'm saying it!

249
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:20,149
Go away! And wait for me,
should have faith in me.

250
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:24,949
My identity and my deeds
actions are a mystery.

251
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:28,149
And the day the mystery
is solved, you...

252
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,227
Are you trying to suppress
death with music?

253
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,361
Death is a reality
which we all have to face.

254
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:23,061
Where is everyone?

255
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:27,028
I've warned them to keep us
informed of their whereabouts.

256
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:32,162
But everyone ignores that.
- No one is loyal to anyone.

257
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:58,265
So the doctor has
also been killed!

258
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,232
He had Anand's name on his lips
before he died.

259
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:07,032
I've always suspected it. And the
doctor has solved this mystery.

260
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:12,166
Now don't ask me
who killed the doctor.

261
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,366
He took your name while dying.
- That's is a lie.

262
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,966
If you don't believe us,
ask Asha!

263
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,767
The doctor uttered
my name before dying.

264
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:30,234
Maybe he wanted to absolve me
and hold Rakesh guilty.

265
00:33:37,735 --> 00:33:41,435
You can't mislead us with that
glib talk and hide the truth.

266
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:43,836
It is clear.
You are the murderer!

267
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,036
You are the killer!

268
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:51,370
You accuse me of being the killer.
And I say, you are the murderer.

269
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,570
The truth will be known
only after another death.

270
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:02,583
It's your turn now.

271
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:07,383
It's your turn next.

272
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:12,184
Your turn to die!

273
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:16,984
You die now!

274
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,788
You've come to the wrong place.
This is my room.

275
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:52,188
Let me stay here.
I'm getting scared.

276
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:54,288
Is Anand not in his room?
- No.

277
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,655
I went to look for him,
but in the living room...

278
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,089
I can't describe what I saw!

279
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:02,589
There, the doctor, Dharamdas,
Mr. Sharma's dead bodies...

280
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:05,789
were staring at me and warning me
that it's my turn now.

281
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:08,190
Scared of dying, are you?

282
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,390
Life is, in fact,
worse than death.

283
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,324
Drink some...
You will overcome your fear.

284
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,591
I don't drink, Kitty.
- Go on!

285
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:21,791
You can't live in fear.

286
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,991
Besides, the ones we suspect
end up dead.

287
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:28,992
But this... it gives you life
even after death.

288
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:31,625
Drink it.
- No!

289
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:49,794
You?
- Yes.

290
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:57,294
How about you?
- Yes, it's me.

291
00:40:22,842 --> 00:40:24,676
There is still
some liquor remaining...

292
00:40:25,209 --> 00:40:26,276
drink that too!

293
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:29,810
Why don't you drink?

294
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,677
There is very little difference
between you and Kitty now.

295
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:35,877
You appear to be angry...
Here, take a sip.

296
00:40:36,244 --> 00:40:39,411
Then you won't differentiate
between me and Asha.

297
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:42,611
You ought to be ashamed to
introduce her to this poison.

298
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:48,212
And you don't give a damn
even if I die.

299
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,278
I mean nothing to you!

300
00:40:50,712 --> 00:40:56,679
Kitty, this chap, Anand...
he loves me immensely.

301
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:01,813
But no one knows who he is...
not even me!

302
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:04,213
You didn't like the
bitter pill, did you?

303
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,613
How can a liar fancy the truth?

304
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:10,614
Go away, Anand!
I don't need any support!

305
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,814
You will not drink that, I say.
- Why not?

306
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:17,014
It isn't any more bitter than you are!
I will drink it.

307
00:41:17,114 --> 00:41:18,615
I said you won't!
- I will!

308
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:47,423
You look upset. You don't appear
to have slept last night?

309
00:42:48,457 --> 00:42:50,624
Kitty has told me about everything
that happened last night.

310
00:42:51,524 --> 00:42:53,824
I think Anand...
- Have you seen Anand?

311
00:42:54,057 --> 00:42:55,624
That's the only thing
left to do.

312
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,891
The rest...
- What are you talking about?

313
00:43:00,225 --> 00:43:01,925
Just that he will
never face us again.

314
00:43:02,325 --> 00:43:04,225
Anand has been proved
to be the murderer.

315
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:06,292
It can't be anyone else.

316
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:10,626
I've already warned Kitty
and am warning you too...

317
00:43:11,126 --> 00:43:14,626
not to venture out alone.
- I am already scared.

318
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,826
Kitty is not in her room and
Anand too is missing.

319
00:43:17,926 --> 00:43:18,627
What?

320
00:44:32,734 --> 00:44:33,834
Who's that?

321
00:46:12,744 --> 00:46:16,244
Someone has killed Kitty too!

322
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:22,645
Not someone... it's Anand.
Look there.

323
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:07,116
I've been waiting for
that murderer all this while.

324
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:10,316
But he didn't turn up.
He has killed my Kitty.

325
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:59,951
Shut up!
And forget Anand.

326
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,352
No one can reach here.

327
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:07,485
Mr Sharma... you were
supposed to be dead!

328
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,286
No.

329
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:13,886
My death was a ploy to
mislead others.

330
00:53:14,786 --> 00:53:17,086
When I realised my game as up...

331
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:19,953
and that Kitty and Anand
suspected me...

332
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:22,687
I confided in the doctor.

333
00:53:23,187 --> 00:53:27,154
I told him there was only
one way to nail the murderer.

334
00:53:35,722 --> 00:53:38,355
We'll play a ploy to
find the murderer.

335
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:45,556
I'll injure myself
and you declare me dead.

336
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,290
Since you are a doctor,
everyone will believe you.

337
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:50,690
Then?
- After I'm declared dead...

338
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,090
I'll try to find
the real culprit.

339
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:01,558
And thus he proved me dead.

340
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:05,091
After that,
he was my first victim.

341
00:54:06,391 --> 00:54:11,959
Because I feared he may expose me.

342
00:54:14,392 --> 00:54:16,292
But you are exposed now.

343
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:19,959
Now that you know the truth,
you won't live for long.

344
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:25,093
You would have been
dead long ago.

345
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:28,760
But I had a desire.

346
00:54:33,594 --> 00:54:35,961
I too have a desire, Mr. Sharma.

347
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:43,495
Inspector Anand. We've been
looking for you for many days.

348
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:45,562
And we meet today.

349
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:48,296
Won't you shake hands?

350
00:54:48,396 --> 00:54:50,696
Had I known you were a
C.I. D inspector then...

351
00:54:53,596 --> 00:54:56,763
Perhaps you would've
killed me too?

352
00:54:57,063 --> 00:55:01,897
Had I known you are the
fugitive Madanlal...

353
00:55:03,997 --> 00:55:07,497
had I known you are
a devil in human guise...

354
00:55:12,231 --> 00:55:14,365
I am the Lord of death.

355
00:55:15,198 --> 00:55:17,898
They were destined
to die at my hands.

356
00:55:18,632 --> 00:55:23,966
I know everything. It was Khanna
who got Mr Sohanlal killed...

357
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:29,900
but you killed not only Khanna,
but his friends too.

358
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:37,900
You would've been exposed the
day you killed Kitty.

359
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:42,701
I gave you a chase
and Rakesh chased me.

360
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:48,302
You played a trick
and escaped.

361
00:55:48,802 --> 00:55:50,368
You caused a smokescreen.

362
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:27,178
Do you recognise me, inspector?
This is Madanlal.

363
00:57:31,345 --> 00:57:33,912
And she is Asha.

364
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,114
There is only one bullet left.

365
00:57:58,748 --> 00:58:01,115
I don't know where it is lodged.

366
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:04,315
One bullet for two people!

367
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,382
Let's see who deserves it.

368
00:58:08,816 --> 00:58:12,783
Before challenging me,
you should've thought twice.

369
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:17,916
I've already committed 6 murders.
This is the seventh.

370
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:33,585
This gun has only one bullet.

371
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:39,985
Let's see who between you,
does death favour?

372
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:45,119
This word doesn't
befit a criminal.

373
00:58:45,219 --> 00:58:46,886
Yes, I am a murderer!

374
00:58:47,219 --> 00:58:50,720
And who compelled me to kill?

375
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,187
Who?
- Mr. Sohanlal...

376
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,920
Khanna and his friends.

377
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:02,388
We were partners in smuggling.

378
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:05,921
How is it related to your
being a murderer?

379
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:07,588
I was arrested once.

380
00:59:08,822 --> 00:59:12,322
In prison, Sohanlal and
Khanna assured me...

381
00:59:12,422 --> 00:59:14,722
that if I admitted
to my crime...

382
00:59:14,822 --> 00:59:17,122
then on release,
I'll get my due share.

383
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:20,323
But they not only deprived me
of my share...

384
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:22,723
but raped my
innocent sister too.

385
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:25,923
She committed suicide.

386
00:59:27,223 --> 00:59:28,790
Now I won't spare you either.

387
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:40,791
Who informed you of your
sister's suicide in the jail?

388
00:59:41,191 --> 00:59:45,125
My brother did, but before he
could harm Khanna...

389
00:59:45,225 --> 00:59:46,725
Khanna got him also killed.

390
00:59:46,825 --> 00:59:48,792
Khanna was a bastard.

391
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:52,326
His greed made him kill
Sohanlal too.

392
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,526
You were released from the
jail on the 13th of this month...

393
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:58,727
when you went to Khanna's
house and killed him.

394
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:00,793
You are omniscient, inspector.

395
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:04,327
On the 24th, on the occasion of the
silver jubilee of Princess Club...

396
01:00:04,827 --> 01:00:07,194
you gave the lucky ticketsto five people...

397
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:10,728
so that as per your plan they'd
board the chartered plane...

398
01:00:10,828 --> 01:00:12,328
to reach the place of their death.

399
01:00:12,828 --> 01:00:15,528
Though they were all
Khanna's people...

400
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:17,595
but they were strangers
to each other.

401
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:19,995
But you killed them brutally.

402
01:00:20,295 --> 01:00:22,729
Yes, I tortured them to death.

403
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:25,596
Society and law could
let them go scot free...

404
01:00:26,029 --> 01:00:28,796
but not me. - No!

405
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,997
You've escaped again.
- But you won't escape, Madanlal.

406
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:41,131
You may kill both of us,
but there's a third person too.

407
01:00:41,864 --> 01:00:43,598
The butler and his sister?

408
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:47,531
So you know about it?
- Yes, I do...

409
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:51,999
about the spirit,
and the mad girl who sings.

410
01:00:52,832 --> 01:00:53,932
She's the butler's siste.

411
01:00:54,432 --> 01:00:56,332
My condition to employ him
was that he came alone.

412
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:59,533
But he secretly brought his
sister too.

413
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:13,601
This time too you were saved.

414
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:21,602
Perhaps the bullet is in
this slot, inspector.

415
01:01:22,968 --> 01:01:25,135
Behold your beloved
one last time.

416
01:01:28,036 --> 01:01:30,402
Maybe you won't get
a second chance.

417
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:06,406
You are very lucky!
The decision is made now.

418
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,740
You are fated to die firt.

419
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,140
But I'm not heartless.

420
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,007
I'll give you a chance too.
To behold your beloved.

421
01:05:42,061 --> 01:05:46,761
Don't you ever dare
sing that song again!
