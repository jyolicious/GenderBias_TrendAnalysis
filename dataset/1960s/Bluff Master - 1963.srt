3
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,514
Passengers at the back
can get down.

4
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:51,594
Why have you stopped the coach
here? I have to go ahead.

5
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:55,754
A coachman's spirit roams here,
which stops the coach.

6
00:02:55,914 --> 00:03:01,354
Hence I was shouting
to you to get down.

7
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:06,234
Go coachman go,
the spirit has left you, go.

8
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,194
Come Sultan.

9
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:19,594
- Well, Mr Gupta, how are you?
- All fine, with your blessings.

10
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:23,594
Here are your Rs.2. Pardon me,
I had gone to Calcutta.

11
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:24,834
Hence the delay.

12
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,114
But there is nothing outstanding
against you.

13
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:31,754
The lender may forget,
but not the borrower.

14
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:33,114
I will see.

15
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:36,874
There is some mistake.

16
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,594
You don't owe me anything.

17
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:40,554
It is a small amount.
You may have forgotten

18
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,034
Please keep it. Good day.

19
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:51,714
Great, there are such honest men
around, who never forget.

20
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:58,234
- Mr Gupta, you must be having Brylcream.
- Yes.

21
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,594
And one pack of biscuits.

22
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:05,514
Get one pack of biscuits and
a bottle of Brylcream.

23
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:08,514
And please write down the
amount in your note book.

24
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,594
Your word is enough.

25
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,474
- Thank you.
- Hello!

26
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:25,994
This business of words,
has never been dull.

27
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,394
Sister Lajvanti.

28
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:35,634
Who? OK. I am just coming.

29
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:40,954
- Uncle! Uncle!
- What have you brought for us?

30
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:49,074
Keep quiet boys, everything is
for you. What did you get?

31
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,114
I have brought English biscuits
for my nephews.

32
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:56,514
Are your nephews any less
then Englishmen!

33
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:57,954
Here.

34
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:02,514
Sister, you also eat!
Where is brother?

35
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:04,554
He has gone on shift.

36
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,554
When he returns I will go.

37
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:08,554
Our life is going on very well.

38
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,474
Husband and wife earn together..

39
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:15,474
And all share and eat. Look,
the commander has also come.

40
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:20,754
Ashok,
were you left early from office?

41
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:28,834
Yes, we are always free.
Here, take this.

42
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,434
99,

43
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:53,234
100. What a beautiful body you've
made, our gaze slips off

44
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:58,394
Ashok, this time I want
to become Hindu Kesari.

45
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:01,874
Consider you are one already.

46
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:05,154
I have brought such a oil,
if you apply an ounce everyday,

47
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,954
You will gain 4 kilos a week.

48
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,954
- Honestly?
- Yes, have I ever told you a lie. Look at this.

49
00:06:15,314 --> 00:06:17,490
The Englishmen have made a
concentrate of strength and..

50
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:18,754
Put it in this bottle.

51
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:20,874
What is the name of it?

52
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:25,434
The name is Mr India Oil,
or Creme la bluf.

53
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,154
How much price?

54
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,954
I have bought it for 16 but in
the market it is for Rs.25.

55
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:34,914
It can't get common man.

56
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,274
Ashok,
please give me this bottle.

57
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:39,674
No, if I give the bottle to you..

58
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:41,794
I'll become weak myself. No way

59
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:46,034
You don't have to wrestle,
so you give it to me!

60
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:48,714
Ok, I will give it to you.

61
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,954
Take out Rs.16,
-I will just bring it.

62
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:05,874
Use it every day,
see the difference in a week.

63
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,474
- Bye!
- Bye!

64
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:18,274
- Good day, Munim.
- You have decorated the room very well.

65
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:26,874
The room, the breeze and the
air, have I decorated..

66
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:30,914
I don't understand this poetry.

67
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:35,914
Spin your top and let us listen
to some nice beat.

68
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,634
Straight away..

69
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:45,154
- Listen! -That is a fake!
- Ask what is real here!

70
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:48,874
Agreed I am not rich,
but the atmosphere is of wealth.

71
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:53,194
See this tub, it has a hole,
so it cannot hold water.

72
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:58,154
This shower works when it rains
& water comes from the terrace

73
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:06,754
And see my beauty queen,
whose dance I see without ticket.

74
00:08:08,034 --> 00:08:12,794
I know, you are making me dance
also. Do you have my rent.

75
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:19,314
Of course, here are Rs.10 in
cash. Remaining Rs.50 in credit.

76
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:25,794
Rs.10 after 10 visits. Come on
what will I tell the owner.

77
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,834
A poor man must help another poor
It is just a matter of a ..

78
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:33,434
Few days,
& I will complete the amount.

79
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,834
Promise? It is a friends promise.

80
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:40,353
- Good bye.
- Bye.

81
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:50,074
For one 75 year old girl,
wanted e suitable groom.

82
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:55,114
A room on rent. Give it.

83
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:02,914
Wanted a photo journalist,
Bhukump Weekly Press.

84
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:10,514
If I can get hold on one camera
from these, my job is certain.

85
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,194
Come, sir. Come.

86
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,194
Has my camera come?
I will just pack it.

87
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:21,474
No, my train is about to come.
Give it to my man, Mr Sengupta.

88
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:25,874
Do a job. I forgot to give
him his ticket to Pune.

89
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,114
Give it to him

90
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:45,034
I am Sengupta, I'm late. Did my
boss leave a camera for me?

91
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:52,234
But I don't recognise you.
You certainly recognise me well.

92
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:54,914
From a name how can you
recognise a face?

93
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:58,154
What should I do, call the
police, or the military..

94
00:09:58,234 --> 00:10:00,114
To confirm I am Sengupta!

95
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,314
Did my boss leave me
a ticket for Poona?

96
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:08,474
Yes He did.
You are the right person.

97
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:17,314
- Where are you put up?
- Hotel Tajmahal, Room 213.

98
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:26,714
- Don't you see and walk?
- I will pick up for you.

99
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:29,674
Are you Mr Sengupta?
Take your wallet.

100
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,274
Your boss has just left..

101
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:37,874
Left a railway ticket.
He has taken the camera. Go now.

102
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,514
- Who are you?
- I am Ashok Azad.

103
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:51,554
Your name sounds familiar.

104
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:53,874
That means you've also
visited London.

105
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:57,234
I was the Chief Reporter of
Sensational Newspaper there.

106
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:00,394
Glad to meet you.
Please sit down.

107
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,794
You have come at the right time.

108
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:06,554
Bhukamp needs a reporter
like you.

109
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,114
I too am on the lookout
for such..

110
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,794
A paper as Bhukamp which
can utilize my skills.

111
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:13,834
I like your paper name,
Bukamp (earth quake)

112
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,954
It looks, it will shake the
world like its name.

113
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,714
I like your personality
and views.

114
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:24,114
If you get some good news, you..

115
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,914
Will find a permanent
place in our newspaper.

116
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:31,034
Keep your ink wet on your
machine, I will just get the news.

117
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,314
Lady, have your breakfast.

118
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,994
I told you so many times..

119
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,234
When I'm going out,
don't mention food!

120
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:49,074
Driver, take out the scooter.

121
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:09,434
I feel like becoming a martyr
under her scooter.

122
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:19,594
- Come I will show you.
- Sister, I never said a thing.

123
00:12:19,914 --> 00:12:20,954
Nothing said?

124
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:28,354
- Mister, what is this?
- Nothing, I just took a photo.

125
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:29,714
What was the need?

126
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:33,914
Do you know it is a crime to take
photo of a unknown girl?

127
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:37,954
Lady, it is a public road..

128
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:41,714
You took law into your own hands
by slapping a pedestrian.

129
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,634
If you want to live,
give me the negative.

130
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,554
Give me your address.

131
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:49,514
I'll come tomorrow morning
and give you the positive.

132
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:51,714
Will you listen and give
me the negative.

133
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:54,594
Watch your scooter or some
one will take it away.

134
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,954
- Has this man molested you?
- No, he has taken my photo.

135
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:03,314
Is this the way you disrespect
other ladies?

136
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:07,834
I will tell you the whole thing.
A goon teased.

137
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:12,434
- This lady got down from the scooter and slapped him.
- Then?

138
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:15,794
I saw this scene and
took a photo.

139
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:19,554
What theft or dacoity
have I committed?

140
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,954
In fact I have captured the
scene of an Indian..

141
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,194
Brave lady in action
for posterity!

142
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,714
But where is the goon?

143
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:31,834
The lady started fighting with
me & the goon ran away!

144
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:36,834
- But how?
- He ran away. It is not difficult to run in Bombay.

145
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,794
I will tell you how.

146
00:13:38,874 --> 00:13:43,354
The bus was coming from
this side, it halted..

147
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:49,314
The goon got into the bus
like this and went away!

148
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:54,954
I will definitely send you
the positive tomorrow.

149
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:07,434
Yes, the paper sold like hot
cakes. Its all due to Asok Azad.

150
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,034
He is a very useful man.

151
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,274
- Yes.
- Mr. Verma..

152
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:15,314
Send Ashok to me.
I want to met him

153
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,554
Okay.

154
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:25,674
What? A lady's hand and a manly
work. A shameless fraud!

155
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:31,154
- May I come in?
- Who is it?

156
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:33,554
I am Ashok Azad.
The editor has sent me.

157
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:39,954
Ashok. Please come in without
permission. Well done!

158
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:44,074
- You have held a falling wall.
- What is your salary fixed?

159
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:47,594
- It is 300.
- Only? It should be Rs. 500.

160
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:49,874
Thank you.
Whether it is 300 or 500..

161
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,394
Makes no difference to me.

162
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,074
It just covers cigerette money.

163
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,954
I have to get a 2000
more from home.

164
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:58,834
- Uncle what is this?
- What happened dear?

165
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:04,554
Just look at this.
You are hitting your own head!

166
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,714
- Today I have my program.
- When they see this, what will they say?

167
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,314
At 3 O'clock Munnibai is coming?
What will she think?

168
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,594
What will she think? Only good!

169
00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:20,194
- You?
- I have only praised you.

170
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,594
Now you don't even need Munnibai.

171
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,794
Go on the stage yourself.
You will receive only claps!

172
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:29,074
Shut up!

173
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,274
- Uncle why are you quiet?
- Yes, uncle why?

174
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:36,074
- Do you know whose photo is this?
- Yes, hers!

175
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:39,074
I was correct, you are fearless
as well as shameless.

176
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:41,794
Mr Ashok, do you know who is she?

177
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:43,954
Wait Uncle. I will tell him.

178
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:46,554
I am the owner of this paper
& you are my servant.

179
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:48,554
This house too is mine,
Now get out of here.

180
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:52,394
And remember, don't show your
face at this door here, again.

181
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:56,114
- Atleast I can show my back?
- You shameless chap!

182
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,754
- Kumar!
- What a welcome!

183
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,634
When did you return from London?

184
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,554
Jwala Prasad,
no news of my going or coming.

185
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:10,114
And you are?

186
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:14,434
She is my niece, Seema.
Seema, this is Mr Ram Kumar.

187
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,754
He has a big export
business abroad

188
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:20,354
- How do you do?
- Namaste!

189
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,394
You appear to be made
up of old traditions.

190
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:26,834
When the man is new, it pays to
have your traditions with you.

191
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,194
Good.

192
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:32,514
A good answer.
Come Mr Kumar. Come..

193
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:37,154
A modern fool.

194
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:43,194
Mr Kumar, how did you come
suddenly from London?

195
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:47,274
You suddenly stopped sending me
money. You know expenses there

196
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:48,794
How will I manage then?

197
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,074
At present I have only
one source of income.

198
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:56,634
But you never told me,
you've such a beautiful niece.

199
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,594
I never got the opportunity.

200
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:00,754
Well, It is never too late.

201
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:02,874
If I had known earlier..

202
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:05,154
Your balance installments would
have reduced by half.

203
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:07,313
Do you like Seema so much?

204
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:11,714
Her beauty is apparent.
But she also appears intelligent.

205
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:15,154
Yes,
after my elder brother's death..

206
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:17,914
I too have looked after
her with a lot of love.

207
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,714
Then do one more job.

208
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:23,474
Where will you find a better
son in law than me.

209
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:25,394
And then you don't have
to worry about..

210
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:28,954
- Sending your installments at all -Sister! Hello!
- Coming.

211
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,754
Sister,
I have brought Derby tickets.

212
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,914
Buy one, you will get Rs10000001.

213
00:17:34,074 --> 00:17:37,154
A million!
Has any body got it before?

214
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,594
Yes. That man in the lane behind,
his mother got it.

215
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:44,554
- And before that barber, his third wife too got it!
- Really!

216
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:48,154
Do you think my luck is any worse
than theirs. Here's Rs10.

217
00:17:48,394 --> 00:17:51,154
Take Gods name and issue
me a ticket also.

218
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:56,354
- Hail, King Raianal!
- Who is this god, Rajanal?

219
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:59,154
Why to God while gambling?

220
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:01,554
He is the greatest gambler.

221
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,394
Rajanal,
make my sister a millionaire.

222
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:06,874
I'll change her name from
Lajwanti to Damyanti.

223
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:10,074
- Be Happy. God keep you happy.
- Bye.

224
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:25,994
What has happened Seema?

225
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:30,034
Read this, Munnibai is finished.

226
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,874
- What?
- Show doomed.

227
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:33,634
What will happen now?

228
00:18:33,714 --> 00:18:36,234
Should I tell?
But first give me my chair.

229
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:40,754
- You? You have come again to trouble us?
- No.

230
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:45,634
You threw me out of a iob.
I have a job here.

231
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:48,314
I raise curtains here.
This chair is for this iob.

232
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:50,834
I relax as well as work here.

233
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:55,554
But today is a holiday for you.
Munnibai is ill.

234
00:18:55,834 --> 00:19:00,594
How terrible!
What will happen to the show now?

235
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:05,314
Now the chairs will dance.
But I have an idea.

236
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,514
I also know one Munnibai.

237
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:09,034
She is a very good singer.

238
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:11,394
Shall I get her.
Your show will be a hit.

239
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:15,394
If the show is a hit,
your job will be confirmed.

240
00:19:16,434 --> 00:19:19,594
But Munnibai will dance and sing
on one condition, that ..

241
00:19:19,674 --> 00:19:23,274
- You too will perform with her.
- Me, never!

242
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:26,434
Please Seema, agree or we will
have to face humiliation.

243
00:19:26,554 --> 00:19:30,954
Please come, please.

244
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:12,234
How is this wind blowing..

245
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:21,514
That the flower is dying
for the drone now.

246
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:30,594
What'll be fate of the flowers,
if the drone appeals to them.

247
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:08,994
Though they refuse on the face,
it is evident they die for us.

248
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:19,314
Fact cannot be hidden by hiding..

249
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:22,834
The heart will become more
restless by suppressing love.

250
00:21:29,514 --> 00:21:34,314
If the heart gets restless,
we know how to pacify it.

251
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:43,034
If it gets distracted,
we know how to get it back.

252
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:48,314
How the wind is blowing..

253
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,674
You say that giving the
heart is a game.

254
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:48,314
In which world are you living?

255
00:22:55,114 --> 00:23:01,794
Love is something else. The heart
burns and there is fire.

256
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:12,834
We are not those who
will cry in love.

257
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:21,834
By falling in love we
spread happiness.

258
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:30,794
The fate of the flowers is bad..

259
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:35,274
That the drones appeals to them

260
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:23,714
We have made you the target &
have shown the path of love.

261
00:24:30,714 --> 00:24:37,194
You are teaching us love
and you show us eyes?

262
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:48,194
If love is true,
then the tongue is silent.

263
00:24:52,554 --> 00:24:56,874
It is that flame,
which survives in stability.

264
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:41,594
Auntie Jamuna,
there is a letter for you.

265
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:45,514
A letter for me?
It must be Dabbu.

266
00:25:49,754 --> 00:25:51,234
- Hello, aunty.
- God bless you.

267
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,354
- Here is your letter.
- It must be my son's letter.

268
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:59,274
Wait. I can't read,
please read it for me.

269
00:26:10,914 --> 00:26:18,874
My dear mother, you will be happy
to know your Dabbu has..

270
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:28,154
- Become a reporter.
- What is a reporter?

271
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:31,474
Repoter?

272
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:39,794
I think it is the younger
brother of Governor.

273
00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:47,354
A governor's younger brother!
Read further, Murari.

274
00:26:47,594 --> 00:26:53,274
From my first month's salary
I am sending Rs. 10 for sweets.

275
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:56,394
There is nothing inside this!

276
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,594
Sending money in an envelope
is a crime..

277
00:26:58,674 --> 00:27:00,674
So he will send it
by a money order.

278
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:08,074
Who is bothered about money,
my son's letter has come. Read!

279
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,554
Next written is..

280
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:18,074
From this spend Rs.2 in the
temple and 8 is for you.

281
00:27:18,154 --> 00:27:24,114
I am so happy, I will distribute
sweets to the entire village.

282
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:27,114
Yes, show to the entire village..

283
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:30,074
They thought Dabbu was useless..

284
00:27:30,194 --> 00:27:31,514
And now he is a big man.

285
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:34,034
Has he given his address?

286
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:41,514
Yes, he stays in Taimahal hotel.
He stays in Taj Mahal! Wow.

287
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:47,594
Ok, auntie, I will go now.
Good day.

288
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:57,234
- Kumar, impossible!
- You will have to make impossible possible.

289
00:27:57,314 --> 00:28:01,234
- But I don't want to go with this man to Theatre.
- I don't like it.

290
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:05,554
- Don't say that, Mr Kumar is your fiancee.
- Fiancee?

291
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:09,114
Yes, your father had chosen
Mr Kumar for you.

292
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:12,674
And he had said on his
death bed that..

293
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:15,154
Your marriage be with Mr Kumar

294
00:28:15,914 --> 00:28:20,594
But Uncle, If he was alive today
he wouldn't have said it now.

295
00:28:20,874 --> 00:28:23,434
It is quite possible.
But I am bound.

296
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:28,754
I'll have to abide by the word
I have given to my brother.

297
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:31,354
Can't say anything more

298
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:59,034
Editor, Mr Ashok has been
taken back on the job.

299
00:28:59,514 --> 00:29:07,514
And I have a ticket of Widow
Ashram Charity show.

300
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:10,474
Row A. Seat 14.

301
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:13,634
I have a spare one,
which I will send for Mr Ashok.

302
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,394
Very good, when Mr Ashok
comes, I will tell him.

303
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:22,914
You have called me sir?
Mr Ashok you can resume work.

304
00:29:23,754 --> 00:29:26,754
Thank you. Can you tell
me who recommended me?

305
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:28,930
Are you interested in the work
or who recommended you?

306
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:29,794
Certainly its work.

307
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:33,834
Then go to this Widows Charity
show and attend the program.

308
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,634
Other details you will get there

309
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:41,954
Here are your tickets 12 and 14.
Nonsense, they are 12 and 13.

310
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:44,354
Have a look at your tickets!

311
00:29:50,034 --> 00:29:53,154
Ashok,
when did you return from America.

312
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:57,274
Only the day before, please sit.

313
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,034
You should have informed me!

314
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:03,954
Anyway meet Mr Kumar,
a very big man of the city.

315
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:07,154
And this is Mr Ashok -Who has
just returned from America

316
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,354
After getting a diploma is
Journalism and Photography.

317
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:14,274
It is good, we have our
own man in Seat no 13.

318
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:15,434
Yes.

319
00:30:16,354 --> 00:30:19,314
If you don't mind will you
shift to seat no 14?

320
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:26,914
Yes, I do.
13 is a very lucky no. For me.

321
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,194
I was born on 13th.

322
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:32,354
Left for America on 13th.
And today is 13th.

323
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:34,754
Perhaps the month is also 13th.
Must be!

324
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,794
Ashok,
what do you think of ice cream.

325
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:39,474
It is a very good thing.

326
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:44,314
- It keeps the mind cool.
- What do you think? -As you like it.

327
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:47,314
Then can you get three
ice creams for us.

328
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,274
- What is this on my seat?
- It is my camera.

329
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,234
- Keep in your side.
- Thank you.

330
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:58,714
- What does this Kumar sell?
- At this time ice cream.

331
00:30:59,314 --> 00:31:02,234
You made a waiter out
of a good man.

332
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:06,994
But after all he is waiter
for whom? It is Seema!

333
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:14,914
I was telling him about you.
He is a very rich man, Mr Rich

334
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,154
You can make out from his face,
See!

335
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,874
Jwala Prasad when are you
going to clear your dues.

336
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:26,794
After Seema's marriage,
each penny will be cleared.

337
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:27,874
After marriage..

338
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:30,914
All property will go into
the name of son in law.

339
00:31:30,994 --> 00:31:32,954
But he is my own man.

340
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:41,674
Today you saved me
from that bore.

341
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:45,154
For that you must make
me your body guard.

342
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,514
Don't forget the picnic
invitation.

343
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:51,594
Seema, I was waiting upstairs.

344
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:55,274
- I thought you had come before me.
- Come!

345
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:58,274
Miss Seema, you are coming
with me on the picnic?

346
00:31:58,754 --> 00:32:01,554
Nothing doing, we are going to
watch the Derby on Race Course.

347
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:06,674
Derby? I too will come.
I will give you good tips.

348
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,954
What very good,
what tips can he give me.

349
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,434
I haven't wasted my time abroad.

350
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,074
Mr Ashok, I was a trainer there!

351
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:18,034
My father is an owner and
trainer in Calcutta.

352
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:22,434
- That's great!
- Let us see whose tips are more correct tomorrow.

353
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:23,834
Come.

354
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,194
There is a party at Mr
Kapoors residence.

355
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:33,514
Take some nice snaps of the
party. Here is the address.

356
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:35,914
Good.

357
00:32:41,674 --> 00:32:45,594
Welcome,
are you from Bhukamp Papers?

358
00:32:46,394 --> 00:32:49,634
Go ahead and take some photos.

359
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:23,554
At last I got you. I had to come.

360
00:33:23,954 --> 00:33:26,714
I went to return the the
camera in the shop,

361
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:31,914
But I came to know of your
son's birthday party.

362
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:34,754
Not birthday party but a
marriage anniversary.

363
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:40,154
Please sit down. It is possible
I might have heard wrong.

364
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:42,154
I thought I will join
your party..

365
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:44,074
When I am in the city and do..

366
00:33:44,154 --> 00:33:45,994
Some thing good for you.

367
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,274
But where were you
all these days.

368
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:50,354
I rang up Mr Sengupta
in Taimahal hotel.

369
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:53,274
But they said,
nobody by that name is there.

370
00:33:54,794 --> 00:33:56,314
You are right.

371
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,794
Since I had come to rest here..

372
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:05,394
I had given my name as Johnny
Breganza -Doesn't matter.

373
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:08,794
Kamla, get some tea and snacks
for Mr. Sengupta.

374
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:17,353
I have to go the airport to see
off my friend to Japan..

375
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:19,994
I have taken a few snaps.
Should I take some more?

376
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:23,514
Don't worry. I have asked for a
photographer from Bhuamp Press

377
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:30,954
I know him, he is a good worker.
I will take leave.

378
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:32,874
Atleast return the camera!

379
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,914
I will develop the prints
and return the camera.

380
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:43,754
Developing is done
at our shop also.

381
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,513
I don't want to trouble you.

382
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:49,594
Good.

383
00:34:57,674 --> 00:34:58,714
Namaste!

384
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:04,794
Aunty!

385
00:35:05,074 --> 00:35:09,234
Is that you Ramdas? Yes, Auntie.
Come.

386
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:17,034
How are you? Fine,
I was returning from the city, ..

387
00:35:17,354 --> 00:35:24,274
I thought I will meet you.
I am here, due to your love.

388
00:35:24,754 --> 00:35:27,154
How was the crop?

389
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:30,754
Very good,
I have paid off my loans..

390
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:36,434
Bought clothes for next year,
and have Rs 100 left. Take it

391
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,194
I will take return,
when will I need it.

392
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:41,554
No, thank you. You are being
extremely kind and trusting.

393
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:45,954
I have someone's jewels,
some money, somebody's clothes..

394
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:50,354
Aunty, you are our bank,
and post office.

395
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:53,194
After 6 months is
my sons marriage.

396
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:56,194
If I keep the money
it will get spent.

397
00:35:56,514 --> 00:35:59,754
A son has to give his
salary to his mother.

398
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:03,354
Ok,

399
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:12,434
I will keep,
these 5 knots are your mark.

400
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:18,194
Mine will be 1 .2,3

401
00:36:24,194 --> 00:36:25,714
- Lajvanti, sister.
- Yes.

402
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:27,754
- Hello!
- Hello, be happy.

403
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:31,154
What is this big mark
on your forehead?

404
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:34,794
Today is my birthday,
and so I had gone to the temple.

405
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:38,554
And you didn't get sweets
for your sister.

406
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:42,914
Today I am taking the kids for
getting ice cream for them

407
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,474
Ice cream!

408
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:48,434
Come kids, Your uncle is taking
you out for ice cream.

409
00:37:01,234 --> 00:37:07,914
Is the Editor there? I am Mr
Kapoor. I had such a big party.

410
00:37:08,074 --> 00:37:09,634
You didn't send a photographer.

411
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:11,674
What? ..Wrong.

412
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:15,194
There was no Mr Ashok.
Impossible..

413
00:37:15,354 --> 00:37:19,114
I am telling you facts!

414
00:37:19,394 --> 00:37:25,034
- He is right.
- Mr Sengupta, please come.

415
00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:28,314
Don't call me Sengupta,

416
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:33,314
I am Ashok.
I am the photographer of Bhukamp.

417
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:37,514
You mean you have been cheating
me from that day?

418
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:45,354
A man who has been struggling
all his life, at times cheats

419
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:49,394
Before you get angry
or call the police..

420
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,434
I want you to spare some
valuable time for me.

421
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:56,354
I have no time for cheats.
I am ringing up the police.

422
00:37:56,434 --> 00:38:00,634
If you have no heart,
please call.

423
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:04,874
These children's mother has left
for her heavenly abode.

424
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:08,114
I will leave them & go to jail.

425
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:13,914
Listen, at least listen to
him, he looks so unhappy.

426
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:18,154
- Ok, say what you want to say.
- Children sit down.

427
00:38:18,554 --> 00:38:26,554
It was 1947.
I had a shop in Lahore.

428
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,914
Business was so good
I used to bring..

429
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:33,074
Money home in a cushion cover.

430
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,954
That year I got married too.

431
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:40,074
But it was God's wish..

432
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:45,394
Due to partition riots
my shop was burnt.

433
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,874
I came to Amritsar.

434
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:55,434
There I came to know my
father-in-law died.

435
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:05,474
My wife became mad. For 3 yrs I
ran around for her treatment..

436
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:11,354
At times in asylums in Bareli
and at times in Agra.

437
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:17,194
I got her cured. 2 years later
our first child was born.

438
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:22,114
God is witness, I had no food
the day he was born.

439
00:39:23,074 --> 00:39:25,794
So we named him Shivvrath
(fasting).

440
00:39:27,354 --> 00:39:29,634
Then we came to Mathura.

441
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:37,074
I borrowed a camera and started
business on footpath.

442
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,274
We had several children.

443
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:41,874
It's rightly said..

444
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:45,194
Poor people have more children.

445
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:49,314
Bachchu was born next..

446
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,274
Then Sutuwa..

447
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:54,554
Then Kunnu..

448
00:39:54,954 --> 00:39:58,274
Munnu, Chunnu..

449
00:39:59,634 --> 00:40:02,754
During her last delivery my poor
wife met with an accident.

450
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:07,914
She was going to buy
milk one day..

451
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:10,114
But she met with an
accident on the way.

452
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:11,954
She fainted there.

453
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:14,994
She was taken to the hospital.

454
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:24,514
Chunnu was born but she died.

455
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,914
I don't want to say
anything more.

456
00:40:41,114 --> 00:40:44,714
When I remember that day my
hair on my body rises.

457
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:51,114
Don't cry son, happiness and
sorrow are two sides of life.

458
00:40:52,154 --> 00:40:54,354
Guru,
get some sweets for the children.

459
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:58,834
Tell me, what can I do for you.

460
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:05,394
Now you know why I took the
camera? Just for these children.

461
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,074
Really. To raise these orphans..

462
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,754
Eat sweets.

463
00:41:14,714 --> 00:41:17,114
In Bhukamp there was a place
vacant for a photographer.

464
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:20,714
Without a camera how
could I get a job.

465
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:23,274
I surely cheated you..

466
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,914
But god knows I had
no bad intentions.

467
00:41:27,674 --> 00:41:31,994
I had thought I would repay
you for your camera.

468
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:35,914
He is a man with responsibility.
Help him.

469
00:41:36,074 --> 00:41:38,514
Mr. Ashok how can I help you?

470
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:41,434
If you return the camera to me..

471
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:45,954
I will worship your
photo everyday

472
00:41:46,914 --> 00:41:48,954
I will lose my job
without camera..

473
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,114
And my children
will be homeless.

474
00:41:52,354 --> 00:41:55,874
If you can help me, I promise..

475
00:41:56,074 --> 00:42:00,234
I will repay you every
month for your camera..

476
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:02,154
And feed these kids

477
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:12,954
If man doesn't help, during
hardships, who will? Take it

478
00:42:13,994 --> 00:42:21,994
Mr Kapoor, you have saved a
sinking boat. I am grateful.

479
00:42:22,754 --> 00:42:29,234
- Here, take some money.
- Mother, I am already indebted.

480
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:37,634
But I am not a beggar.

481
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:41,194
Thank you. Come children.

482
00:42:46,754 --> 00:42:51,434
Poor chap, though fate has been
unkind to him, he is so nice.

483
00:42:58,314 --> 00:43:01,114
You have done wonders!
Were you a jockey earlier?

484
00:43:01,474 --> 00:43:04,954
- He was a trainer in England. Training donkeys.
- What?

485
00:43:05,554 --> 00:43:09,594
- I mean horses.
- Ok, but see me in Derby.

486
00:43:09,714 --> 00:43:13,594
But Mr Kumar,
I hate horses and donkeys.

487
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:17,474
You are referring to Ashok.
I too hate such kind of people.

488
00:43:17,714 --> 00:43:20,514
- Horses would hate humans, Mr. Kumar.
- What?

489
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:24,514
Who will win the Derby?

490
00:43:24,594 --> 00:43:25,874
100 that one.

491
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:31,594
Mention and here comes No. 13.

492
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:34,634
- How is it going?
- Ask her.

493
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:41,434
- He has already won thrice!
- Great, your luck is great here.

494
00:43:41,794 --> 00:43:45,034
You should remain here only till
the derby race is finished

495
00:43:45,194 --> 00:43:47,874
Good, till then we will make
arrangements for the picnic.

496
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:52,954
Yes, you stay here.
Don't move. We will just come.

497
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:55,954
Mr Ashok, you were going to
give me the Derby winner.

498
00:43:57,114 --> 00:44:02,354
Give the book, put on No 11.
He is a good horse.

499
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:07,954
No11? He will not be able to
catch even the tail of Bone.

500
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:09,834
Yes, for he will be ahead.

501
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,674
Now leave this fight.

502
00:44:12,874 --> 00:44:14,154
If Kabab Me Haddiwins..

503
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,714
Then Kumar and me will
go for the picnic.

504
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,194
If No.11,
Bluff master wins then..

505
00:44:22,634 --> 00:44:26,794
Mr Ashok and myself will go and
you can come with the girls.

506
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:29,514
Ok, let us shake on that..

507
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:58,194
It is not Bluff Master, but it
is the beauty which has won.

508
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:41,154
Beauty has made such a move,
that lover is in a bad shape.

509
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:50,514
By love, a miracle has happened

510
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:59,954
The heart says no,
but the eyes say yes.

511
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:03,834
By love, a miracle has happened

512
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:34,074
Some times she comes near,
sometimes she is far away.

513
00:47:34,274 --> 00:47:38,674
Is this the style to steal
people's hearts.

514
00:47:38,874 --> 00:47:42,954
The arrow has yet to
leave the bow..

515
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:54,394
Somebody tell him to
safeguard his heart.

516
00:47:54,474 --> 00:48:02,474
Beauty has made such a move,
the lover is perplexed..

517
00:48:13,674 --> 00:48:18,154
By love, a miracle has happened

518
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:39,154
How long will you
save your self..

519
00:48:39,234 --> 00:48:42,074
It is now difficult to save..

520
00:48:42,274 --> 00:48:44,954
Yourself,
now that the aim has been taken.

521
00:48:45,114 --> 00:48:49,554
What about me! I will die if you
just look at me and smile.

522
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:52,954
This heart is yours,
the world is yours..

523
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:57,314
You look there but
your mind is here.

524
00:49:57,634 --> 00:50:01,834
My hair sends out a message &
one who is love struck comes

525
00:51:02,314 --> 00:51:04,274
You are asking me how
was the picnic.

526
00:51:04,474 --> 00:51:07,474
It was such, that taste hasn't
still gone from the mouth.

527
00:51:08,114 --> 00:51:13,234
- So you had a ball!
- No, we had gone but somebody else enjoyed.

528
00:51:13,474 --> 00:51:16,954
- Who was that?
- My permanent enemy Ashok.

529
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:20,234
So he had reached there too.

530
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:23,154
Yes, and he duped us.

531
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:26,914
Look,
I don't like what Seema is doing.

532
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,594
She goes with me and
enjoys with him.

533
00:51:29,674 --> 00:51:31,754
My sandwiches and
she feeds Ashok.

534
00:51:32,154 --> 00:51:36,354
In front of me,
she went off with that Ashok.

535
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:39,954
Kumar, that was very bad.

536
00:51:40,274 --> 00:51:44,394
Look Mr Dwarka, don't rub salt
into my wounds with sympathy.

537
00:51:44,714 --> 00:51:48,434
In this what can I do?
She was with you.

538
00:51:48,714 --> 00:51:50,754
Whose job is it to keep her
in check, mine or yours?

539
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:55,954
Should I take her in chains.
Look, please talk to her today..

540
00:51:56,434 --> 00:52:02,594
Else I'll put you in such a fix
where last wishes are asked.

541
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,634
You haven't behaved correctly
with Mr. Kumar.

542
00:52:19,914 --> 00:52:21,394
But neither have I wronged him.

543
00:52:21,594 --> 00:52:26,354
In the picnic you fooled him and
went away with that reporter.

544
00:52:26,754 --> 00:52:28,474
It won't be tolerated.

545
00:52:29,074 --> 00:52:33,994
Uncle, explain to him, not to
take lime in a curd pan..

546
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:35,314
Else he will cut his mouth.

547
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:39,634
Seema, he is your fiancee.
Roaming with Ashok is incorrect.

548
00:52:40,314 --> 00:52:42,554
Else our family name
will be soiled.

549
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:45,434
Why do you think Ashok is just
an ordinary reporter?

550
00:52:45,754 --> 00:52:47,514
He is from a good family.

551
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:53,154
I have called him for my birthday
party. You talk to him.

552
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:58,914
I don't think it necessary to
talk to one who works for us.

553
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:06,554
Love made such a move..
The lover is perplexed!

554
00:53:07,594 --> 00:53:08,634
Turn back.

555
00:53:09,074 --> 00:53:11,154
You were alright yesterday.
What has happened today?

556
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:15,434
By love, a miracle has happened

557
00:53:18,674 --> 00:53:25,714
She has accepted my love.
Now I am hers, & she is mine.

558
00:53:25,794 --> 00:53:27,594
Damn this love.

559
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,634
Listen, spread your legs looking
at your sheet, and ..

560
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:33,274
Stand upright looking
at your ceiling height!

561
00:53:33,354 --> 00:53:36,234
And give your heart,
looking at your pocket.

562
00:53:36,954 --> 00:53:40,114
Where are you, a pauper,
and she, who is so rich.

563
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:44,034
You put a horse in a tonga,
not a deer.

564
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:47,514
It is a matter of love.
In love all these are immaterial.

565
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,274
Love sees only the heart.

566
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:56,434
Seema has called me for
her birthday party.

567
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:59,634
But what gift are you taking
for her, a rattler?

568
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:05,594
That is too cheap, I must give
her an expensive one. Listen

569
00:54:06,874 --> 00:54:10,514
Leave me,
I don't have even a penny today.

570
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:16,634
Ok, I am leaving everything for
tomorrow, but think over it.

571
00:54:18,394 --> 00:54:25,234
Look what has happened?
I am finished.

572
00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:27,954
Jumna Auntie, what has happened?

573
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:32,394
Come inside and see!

574
00:54:34,914 --> 00:54:37,394
See,
in the darkness of the night..

575
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,434
They have taken everything.

576
00:54:39,514 --> 00:54:43,594
It belonged to all!

577
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:48,314
Oh God, some poor farmer might
have to buy seeds..

578
00:54:48,874 --> 00:54:51,434
Someone would have marry
to his sister or daughter.

579
00:54:51,714 --> 00:54:57,874
God, he should be burn in hell.

580
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:04,274
Such a big wall was broken,
and you didn't hear anything?

581
00:55:04,474 --> 00:55:06,674
Do you sleep so soundly
in old age?

582
00:55:06,754 --> 00:55:09,874
All those who trusted
her are finished..

583
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:11,994
Trusting this old woman.

584
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:17,834
You are saying this?
Don't you know Aunt Jamuna?

585
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:21,314
I don't want to die by swindling
other's money.

586
00:55:21,394 --> 00:55:26,034
Perhaps you have sent the
money to your son!

587
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:28,314
Sahivda, I'm a landlady.

588
00:55:28,634 --> 00:55:30,634
I shall kill a son like this..

589
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,314
Who would be raised
on stolen money.

590
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:35,554
Today I'll go to my son..

591
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:39,274
Get the money & throw
it into your face!

592
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:42,674
So now you want to disappear?

593
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:45,954
Do you think I am going
like a thief..

594
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:48,394
I am leaving my house
& land behind.

595
00:55:48,474 --> 00:55:50,954
If I do not return,
you may confiscate them.

596
00:56:03,754 --> 00:56:05,354
Seema, please come here.

597
00:56:07,754 --> 00:56:09,274
This is Lala Harbans Lal.

598
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:11,034
Congraculations, Seema.

599
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:17,394
Seema,
whom are your eyes searching for?

600
00:56:18,554 --> 00:56:21,914
- It must be that picnic guy.
- Neera, don't cross your limits.

601
00:56:22,434 --> 00:56:26,554
What did I say, if lightening
falls, don't blame me.

602
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:35,034
Understand my compulsions. I
touch your feet. Return my Rs.50.

603
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:39,314
You don't know how I
have saved this..

604
00:56:39,394 --> 00:56:42,954
Money for my friend's birthday.

605
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,714
But didn't you give your
word for today? Yes.

606
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:48,554
What will I tell the proprietor?

607
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:54,594
Tell him in Rs.50 one can't
marry a second time..

608
00:56:54,674 --> 00:56:56,594
But only once.

609
00:56:57,194 --> 00:57:02,554
Just remember your young days.
You too must have loved a girl.

610
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:05,874
No, in our family we don't
love and get married.

611
00:57:06,114 --> 00:57:14,114
You may not, but think of me.
I am in love.

612
00:57:15,994 --> 00:57:18,874
Give me the money.

613
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:23,954
Mr Ashok. You may rant & rave.
But now my heart is now stone.

614
00:57:28,274 --> 00:57:31,234
If I had known I wouldn't have
set my house on fire.

615
00:57:33,794 --> 00:57:39,474
I have seen a beautiful present
for your beloved.

616
00:57:39,554 --> 00:57:41,274
It is Tajmahal.

617
00:57:41,914 --> 00:57:45,874
Then why are you telling me.
Inform Shah Jahan.

618
00:57:46,794 --> 00:57:52,234
- Munim has taken the Rs.50 I had with me.
- Oh hell.

619
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:02,794
Excuse me I got a bit delayed.
A cow came in the way.

620
00:58:03,634 --> 00:58:07,794
May you live a 1000 years,
and It each year have 50000 days.

621
00:58:07,994 --> 00:58:09,554
Why are you cursing me,
Mr. Kumar?

622
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:14,554
- I want to die in young age!
- I am here to die, why you?

623
00:58:16,474 --> 00:58:18,274
- Have you thought of anything?
- No Idea!

624
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:24,834
May be we have thought the same.

625
00:58:24,954 --> 00:58:25,994
Govinda.

626
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:27,754
Today is festival
of Lord Krishna.

627
00:58:27,914 --> 00:58:29,634
And Satoriya babu organises
"Dahi handi"..

628
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,274
Festival in Mangalwadi
every year.

629
00:58:31,354 --> 00:58:32,850
Yes, in its pot he keeps
a Rs 100 note.

630
00:58:32,874 --> 00:58:35,154
It is a dangerous job,
but what to do.

631
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:36,794
On one side is love & on..

632
00:58:36,874 --> 00:58:40,114
The other broken bones.
Let us see what happens.

633
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:55,034
Govinda has come,
keep the pot safe, Brijbala.

634
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:10,954
1,2... 7 cowherds are with with

635
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:49,514
Here comes the butter thieves.
Be careful of them.

636
01:00:57,314 --> 01:01:01,714
They are very naughty.

637
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:09,794
If they decide,
then there is no chance!

638
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:46,794
See how happily have they come.

639
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:52,874
They will play a festival
of milk.

640
01:01:57,074 --> 01:02:02,274
No matter how much water you
throw, their enthusiasm is great

641
01:03:08,114 --> 01:03:11,554
Govinda has come..

642
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:15,874
Watch out for the pot..

643
01:03:16,714 --> 01:03:21,754
Govinda has come.

644
01:05:35,034 --> 01:05:37,994
- What have you come to take?
- Nothing, but to give a present.

645
01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:46,114
This you should have brought
365 days later.

646
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:50,474
You are not ashamed.

647
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:53,274
I told everybody that
you are coming.

648
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:54,994
Why am I jinxed?

649
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:59,354
And you are coming now?
Just listen to me

650
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:01,674
I don't want to listen
to anything.

651
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:10,794
- Seema, open the door, may be it is our last meeting.
- Why?

652
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,074
That's what I want
to explain you.

653
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:18,554
My father has come from Calcutta.
My marriage is fixed.

654
01:06:19,234 --> 01:06:23,314
- It is good then.
- Is it? Ok, then.

655
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:33,314
- Your marriage is fixed.
- Yes, that is how I got late.

656
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:38,914
But reach for your marriage
in time. Ok then.

657
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:44,034
Listen can't you say no?

658
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:48,114
He will be a fool who will
say no to a marriage.

659
01:06:48,194 --> 01:06:49,674
Did you see the girl?

660
01:06:50,194 --> 01:06:57,114
No, but her photograph.
Big eyes, long hair, pink cheeks.

661
01:06:57,674 --> 01:07:00,674
She is good. Then why were you
doing this drama with me.

662
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:04,954
If you were to marry some other
why were you romancing me?

663
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:12,114
I didn't know you were serious.
You never said a thing!

664
01:07:12,354 --> 01:07:13,914
What is there to say?

665
01:07:15,354 --> 01:07:17,314
All these days we
were dancing &..

666
01:07:17,394 --> 01:07:19,274
Singing it had no effect on you?

667
01:07:19,474 --> 01:07:26,474
My god, does singing and dancing
mean this? I am a simple man.

668
01:07:26,714 --> 01:07:31,474
If you tell me frankly I will
straight away cancel ..

669
01:07:31,554 --> 01:07:34,474
My ticket to Calcutta.

670
01:07:35,234 --> 01:07:38,314
What do they say?
Same thing what a lover say in..

671
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:43,114
English to her beloved,

672
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:52,354
I ..love..try and understand.

673
01:07:58,114 --> 01:07:59,594
You have slapped me.

674
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:08,874
You are saying it as if you
are reading from a book.

675
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:17,714
You have said it as a mother
will speak to her child.

676
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:23,674
Please tell me how to say it,
I have never said it before.

677
01:08:23,953 --> 01:08:27,353
- Seema do you see English films?
- Yes.

678
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:31,953
There how is love expressed?

679
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:53,113
Yes, that is it. I will tell
Dad to cancel the marriage.

680
01:08:54,314 --> 01:09:01,874
But tell dad,
he must have a meal with us.

681
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:07,834
- He only eats food made by mother.
- But why?

682
01:09:07,953 --> 01:09:10,433
He is traditional,
and vegetarian.

683
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,674
He is very careful of purity.

684
01:09:13,794 --> 01:09:17,874
- Ok then tea?
- My grandfather hasn't taken tea.

685
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:19,673
He is very short tempered.

686
01:09:19,754 --> 01:09:22,274
Don't ask as he may
give you a slap.

687
01:09:23,314 --> 01:09:25,834
Ok, at least let me meet him.

688
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:29,394
If not, then I will not become
his daughter in law.

689
01:09:32,554 --> 01:09:34,954
- You are marrying me, isn't my meeting enough?
- No.

690
01:09:35,913 --> 01:09:38,873
Ok, I will bring him.

691
01:09:40,874 --> 01:09:41,914
Happy birthday.

692
01:09:48,834 --> 01:09:49,874
Lady, I had said..

693
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:52,953
I'll light a candle when
I am successful in love.

694
01:09:53,113 --> 01:09:54,834
I have come.

695
01:10:39,954 --> 01:10:47,954
I had thought I'll not love.
And I will not die for a face

696
01:10:48,554 --> 01:10:51,794
But the heart fell on one.

697
01:11:34,714 --> 01:11:42,714
I sifted through the sands
of this world..

698
01:11:45,914 --> 01:11:50,034
I didn't listen to
anybody till now.

699
01:11:54,234 --> 01:11:57,834
But then how did I slip?

700
01:12:32,034 --> 01:12:36,514
If I had not given my heart,
I may have a become big man

701
01:12:42,674 --> 01:12:46,874
But what better work would
I have done than love.

702
01:12:55,514 --> 01:13:03,514
I thought I will not fall in
love. I will not slip on a face.

703
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:52,914
- Son, is there a Tajmahal Hotel?
- Yes, there is.

704
01:13:53,914 --> 01:13:58,114
- Then take me there.
- I will take Rs 1 for it.

705
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:01,994
But I have only 8 annas.

706
01:14:02,074 --> 01:14:05,114
What!
You won't get change for it there

707
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,354
But are you going to beg in
front of Tajmahal Hotel?

708
01:14:10,194 --> 01:14:13,474
What, do I look like a beggar?
I am a land owner in a village

709
01:14:14,194 --> 01:14:16,474
Pardon me, I will just drop you.

710
01:14:35,834 --> 01:14:41,354
Mother, this is Tai Hotel.
Is it I will just get down.

711
01:14:46,634 --> 01:14:50,714
Here is your 8 annas.
If you want more, just wait..

712
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:53,274
My son is the owner here.

713
01:14:53,434 --> 01:14:54,834
I will get it for you.

714
01:14:55,154 --> 01:14:58,434
No mother, I am happy.

715
01:15:14,594 --> 01:15:17,074
Look I want to meet Dabbu.

716
01:15:17,154 --> 01:15:19,434
- Dabbu?
- Yes, he is my son.

717
01:15:19,834 --> 01:15:21,594
He stays in this hotel.

718
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:26,394
Looking at you, your son must be
staying in some charity home.

719
01:15:26,474 --> 01:15:30,834
Your son must be staying there.
My son stays here only

720
01:15:31,514 --> 01:15:33,954
He is governor's younger brother.

721
01:15:34,834 --> 01:15:38,074
What! It looks you have
lost your brain.

722
01:15:38,674 --> 01:15:42,794
Careful, if my Dabbu hears you,
he will break your head.

723
01:15:46,394 --> 01:15:50,274
- Brother, you know my Dabbu?
- Dabbu, what is dabbu?

724
01:15:51,594 --> 01:15:53,514
He stays here, Here is his photo.

725
01:16:05,634 --> 01:16:07,554
You know him, where is he?

726
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:18,594
Is anybody there,
I want to meet Mr Jwala Prasad.

727
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,394
Who are you?

728
01:16:20,674 --> 01:16:26,954
You do not know me. I am Seth
Suraj Mal, only father of that..

729
01:16:27,074 --> 01:16:31,514
Ashok who has been entrapped
by your niece.

730
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:33,514
Have patience.

731
01:16:34,114 --> 01:16:36,394
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down

732
01:16:36,834 --> 01:16:38,994
My name has been rubbed
into dust.

733
01:16:39,354 --> 01:16:41,834
He has fallen in love with
a girl from a family..

734
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:44,954
With whom we have enmity
for the last 300 years!

735
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,834
I do not know anything.

736
01:16:48,314 --> 01:16:52,274
It is only yesterday that Seema
told me about your coming.

737
01:16:52,394 --> 01:16:54,794
What else could I have done!

738
01:16:54,914 --> 01:16:56,514
Now tell me frankly
what is the matter.

739
01:16:57,074 --> 01:17:00,674
It is clear Ashok and Seema
love each other.

740
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:06,074
My God, couldn't he find any
other family to fall in love.

741
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:10,674
Forget all these old quarrels.

742
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:13,434
Why should the kids suffer?

743
01:17:13,514 --> 01:17:18,154
It is no ordinary fight.
Don't try and give advice.

744
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,154
Fool! Trying to be smart.

745
01:17:21,634 --> 01:17:25,994
Can your words cool
down this rage?

746
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:30,034
If I has known this Ashok on
growing up would fall for a ..

747
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:35,074
Girl from this family
I would have...

748
01:17:37,034 --> 01:17:39,554
OK, call the girl.

749
01:17:40,154 --> 01:17:48,154
I have spent Rs.300, traveled
1200 miles by air, and come here

750
01:17:52,274 --> 01:17:58,314
Go and call the girl.
Here she comes.

751
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:28,834
Touch his feet,
he is Ashok's father. God bless.

752
01:18:30,594 --> 01:18:33,074
This girl cannot be
from this house.

753
01:18:33,394 --> 01:18:38,514
Amongst these scoundrels.
A girl like her, impossible.

754
01:18:41,794 --> 01:18:45,274
- You must forget old enmity.
- I will have to.

755
01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:48,474
Sit down there!

756
01:18:57,154 --> 01:19:01,874
- Girl, how old are you?
- She is just.. -You keep quiet!

757
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:07,514
- Let the girl talk.
- I am 18 years old.

758
01:19:10,234 --> 01:19:13,714
And Ashok said you are 17.

759
01:19:18,074 --> 01:19:19,114
Doesn't matter.

760
01:19:21,474 --> 01:19:25,914
- Girl, what is your education?
- I have done matriculation..

761
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:30,074
- I applied for college..
- When you fell in love with Ashok.

762
01:19:31,274 --> 01:19:36,074
This love is such,
it makes you forget all.

763
01:19:36,154 --> 01:19:38,314
Anyway, walk & show

764
01:19:41,154 --> 01:19:43,154
I am an old player.

765
01:19:43,274 --> 01:19:48,474
I know you walked till this place
-But sir..

766
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:53,354
But one can know of a girls
character from her walk.

767
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:57,874
Just show your walk. Please walk.

768
01:20:03,394 --> 01:20:09,314
Beautiful.
Very nice. I am satisfied.

769
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:16,354
I had decided to take Ashok back
with me to Calcutta, but..

770
01:20:16,754 --> 01:20:20,674
This girl has doused all
my anger against Ashok.

771
01:20:21,474 --> 01:20:27,354
Such a girl, so remarkable,
so sweet, so beautiful.

772
01:20:27,754 --> 01:20:30,594
So what if the family is useless.

773
01:20:32,034 --> 01:20:35,034
Girl, do you have any
liking for any art.

774
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:40,514
I play sitar,
and I know classical music.

775
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:48,394
Get a sitar.
Let us see this quality also.

776
01:20:50,114 --> 01:20:51,514
Chandan, get the sitar.

777
01:21:29,474 --> 01:21:37,194
Heartless lover,
go away My lover is bad.

778
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:42,794
Go away!
Go away Don't go on talking

779
01:22:21,874 --> 01:22:29,874
Playing the flute, you overwhelm
me with its melodious tone.

780
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:33,674
You have many forms, and in each
you attract me.. Go, go.

781
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:08,994
Wonderful, Ashok's mother too is
fond of such devotion to god.

782
01:24:10,674 --> 01:24:14,434
In youth, she too sang.
What fusion of beauty and talent.

783
01:24:14,794 --> 01:24:17,394
She will sing and mother
in law will nod.

784
01:24:18,034 --> 01:24:22,354
Mr Kapoor this is Ashok's father.
Glad to meet you.

785
01:24:23,794 --> 01:24:26,514
Your face is very familiar.
Have we met before?

786
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:30,394
I accept this marriage
whole heartedly.

787
01:24:30,554 --> 01:24:33,274
You may celebrate this marriage
with great gusto. And you?

788
01:24:33,514 --> 01:24:37,514
Oh, I am a busy man.

789
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:44,154
Consider him your son
& get him married.

790
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:55,954
- Your introductions please.
- Mr Kumar, he is Ashok's father.

791
01:24:56,274 --> 01:24:58,914
- Oh I see, meet her.
- She is Ashok's mother.

792
01:25:09,954 --> 01:25:14,234
Now, should I use my hands or
you'll show what you really are

793
01:25:14,954 --> 01:25:16,754
Mr Kumar,
what nonsense are you talking.

794
01:25:18,554 --> 01:25:24,034
Seema, it is good that this
good lady has come in time.

795
01:25:24,314 --> 01:25:26,234
Else your life would
have been ruined.

796
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:29,954
Mr Kumar,
I don't need your sympathy.

797
01:25:46,394 --> 01:25:48,634
I will get a taxi.

798
01:26:08,954 --> 01:26:14,274
Ashok, were you playing with
me as if I were a toy?

799
01:26:17,954 --> 01:26:22,514
Dabbu, I cannot understand
what is this drama.

800
01:26:22,914 --> 01:26:29,634
The drama is over. God knows how
many people he has duped.

801
01:26:30,034 --> 01:26:32,634
Don't know how much people
have been trapped.

802
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:34,314
I'm also one of them.

803
01:26:34,754 --> 01:26:38,194
He took my camera, and also Rs.
100 from my wife.

804
01:26:38,394 --> 01:26:43,954
Look, we are respectable people
but this shameless chap..

805
01:26:44,754 --> 01:26:46,394
But this useless..

806
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:51,754
Ashok you have disgraced me.

807
01:26:52,594 --> 01:26:54,514
You have made a joke of my life

808
01:26:55,154 --> 01:26:58,394
Why did you have to
do such a thing.

809
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:05,954
Daughter, he is a fake coin.
Is it for today's disgrace that..

810
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:08,274
How can he love..

811
01:27:08,754 --> 01:27:14,034
- I gave you birth?
- Mother!

812
01:27:14,114 --> 01:27:15,634
Your mother is dead.

813
01:27:15,714 --> 01:27:18,914
If I had known you will
become like this..

814
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:22,074
I would have killed
you at birth.

815
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:25,114
Our house got burgled.

816
01:27:26,154 --> 01:27:27,794
People lost their belongings.

817
01:27:28,914 --> 01:27:34,834
I thought I will return people's
belongings which were stolen.

818
01:27:35,634 --> 01:27:43,554
I did not know my son is
now cheating the world.

819
01:27:44,194 --> 01:27:47,074
You will not have to be
disappointed about money, mother

820
01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:49,754
You will steal,
you will commit dacoity..

821
01:27:53,554 --> 01:27:59,594
Your father never even took
a Loan, and you? His blood!

822
01:28:00,354 --> 01:28:02,434
You have defamed me.

823
01:28:02,634 --> 01:28:07,914
Remember if I can give you birth,
I can take your life also.

824
01:28:08,234 --> 01:28:10,074
I will kill you.

825
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:18,274
Mother! Why do you need a mother?

826
01:28:19,154 --> 01:28:21,754
You have shocked her by
telling so many lies.

827
01:28:29,074 --> 01:28:33,194
She has received a big shock.
BP is also high.

828
01:28:33,754 --> 01:28:37,314
- Doctor, is there any danger?
- Let her regain her senses.

829
01:28:37,514 --> 01:28:42,554
Then only my medicine
will work properly.

830
01:28:42,954 --> 01:28:46,794
- All this has happened due to me.
- You are realising this now?

831
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:52,114
I didn't know the effect of my
lies will endanger my mother.

832
01:28:53,794 --> 01:28:55,194
Mother, open eyes.

833
01:28:58,154 --> 01:29:01,314
Mother, it is my fault,
and you are suffering.

834
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:05,154
Mother I accepted I have
done all those things.

835
01:29:05,434 --> 01:29:10,794
I told lies, I impersonated,
but I am not a thief.

836
01:29:11,234 --> 01:29:15,394
I thought one day I will
become a big man..

837
01:29:15,554 --> 01:29:16,714
I could help you..

838
01:29:16,794 --> 01:29:19,194
But I was misled.

839
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:23,714
Please forgive me, mother.

840
01:29:23,954 --> 01:29:27,674
I swear by you today..

841
01:29:28,074 --> 01:29:30,154
I will never do such
things again.

842
01:29:30,514 --> 01:29:32,594
I will be honest.

843
01:29:32,794 --> 01:29:34,794
Forgive me, mother.

844
01:29:54,834 --> 01:30:02,354
Mother perhaps has heard me,
and has perhaps forgiven me.

845
01:30:03,594 --> 01:30:07,194
Even God forgives those who
seek true repentance.

846
01:30:07,754 --> 01:30:13,434
God, you are very kind. I'm
leaving this Lottery ticket here.

847
01:30:13,714 --> 01:30:17,634
If not 7 give me at least 2,
3 lakhs.

848
01:30:25,154 --> 01:30:29,954
God, when will you fulfill my
wishes of becoming Mr India.

849
01:30:30,154 --> 01:30:33,474
I asked Ashok to get imported
oil for massage.

850
01:30:33,954 --> 01:30:36,154
When will you fulfil my wish,
God!

851
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:40,194
God, please fulfill my wishes.

852
01:30:40,674 --> 01:30:43,114
I will be happy even with little.

853
01:30:43,194 --> 01:30:44,834
Yes.

854
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:49,474
Hello Ashok come and take
God's blessings.

855
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:55,554
The prayer session
has gone well..

856
01:30:55,634 --> 01:30:59,034
I will surely get the lottery

857
01:31:00,314 --> 01:31:01,354
Oh God!

858
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,436
What happened to this climate?

859
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:09,114
When a person cheats..

860
01:31:09,194 --> 01:31:17,194
And tells lies,
there are storms & tempest.

861
01:31:18,554 --> 01:31:21,554
But brother, there is no such
sinner in our building.

862
01:31:25,834 --> 01:31:29,354
God please forgive me.
Give me strength..

863
01:31:29,434 --> 01:31:32,634
So that I can control myself.

864
01:31:43,474 --> 01:31:46,714
I have been a cheat at all steps.

865
01:31:50,154 --> 01:31:55,874
Sister you'll never
get this lottery

866
01:31:56,634 --> 01:31:58,834
Brother, don't fool around
with your sister.

867
01:32:02,594 --> 01:32:05,314
Ashok, are you kidding?

868
01:32:06,234 --> 01:32:08,954
Rambharose,
I am telling the truth.

869
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:14,714
You can never become
Mr India in life.

870
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:19,874
I gave you fake oil
it was hair oil.

871
01:32:20,674 --> 01:32:22,794
Here is your money Take it back.

872
01:32:27,394 --> 01:32:30,314
I had told you lies your
voice is fit for films.

873
01:32:31,554 --> 01:32:35,154
Forget becoming a famous singer.
Otherwise you sing well.

874
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:40,794
What are you standing here for.
I think he has gone mad.

875
01:32:41,834 --> 01:32:44,474
When are we getting our money?

876
01:32:44,554 --> 01:32:47,434
Mummy has said she will make
good clothes for us.

877
01:32:52,594 --> 01:32:56,154
Please explain to all, that this
is not a lottery ticket..

878
01:32:56,514 --> 01:32:57,954
It is a laundry receipt.

879
01:32:59,394 --> 01:33:00,914
Yes, sister.

880
01:33:01,274 --> 01:33:02,834
This is a laundry receipt!

881
01:33:03,194 --> 01:33:07,874
My god, he has been cheating
us all this while.

882
01:33:08,034 --> 01:33:09,354
He has fooled us all along.

883
01:33:09,434 --> 01:33:15,594
He has deceived us by
staying with us.

884
01:33:20,714 --> 01:33:25,274
Mother, where are you going?

885
01:33:25,874 --> 01:33:27,354
Where are you going?

886
01:33:30,594 --> 01:33:33,554
I came to the city with
great expectations..

887
01:33:34,394 --> 01:33:36,314
But everything is lost.

888
01:33:36,954 --> 01:33:39,434
He,
who I gave birth to has put the..

889
01:33:39,514 --> 01:33:41,594
Black spot on our character.

890
01:33:41,674 --> 01:33:45,474
No, mother, Ashok is
not the same Ashok.

891
01:33:46,314 --> 01:33:49,274
He has realised his folly and
washed his sins with remorse.

892
01:33:49,714 --> 01:33:52,714
He has sworn he will walk on the
road of truth and honesty.

893
01:33:54,154 --> 01:33:59,914
- You have faith?
- Without faith there is no life.

894
01:34:00,634 --> 01:34:04,074
With this small happiness,
I will return to my village.

895
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:11,954
No, who is letting you go.
Doctor has said you need rest.

896
01:34:13,074 --> 01:34:16,754
You have now your daughter's
request.

897
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:18,794
Come with me.

898
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:25,914
Mr Kapoor, here is your property
and your Rs.100.

899
01:34:28,114 --> 01:34:33,154
Where did you get this money
from. Did you again cheat?

900
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,874
I am your defaulter.
You can say whatever you want.

901
01:34:37,314 --> 01:34:41,674
But I have decided to walk
in the straight path.

902
01:34:43,434 --> 01:34:45,074
How did you correct
yourself so soon?

903
01:34:45,274 --> 01:34:47,634
Time teaches a lot very soon.

904
01:34:55,754 --> 01:35:03,754
Ashok, come over. You seem to
have come down to mother earth.

905
01:35:04,754 --> 01:35:07,154
Oh, you are in one piece.

906
01:35:07,794 --> 01:35:10,434
I was about to be doomed!

907
01:35:12,434 --> 01:35:14,154
Whatever happened
was for the good.

908
01:35:15,874 --> 01:35:18,034
But what will happen
to mother's debt.

909
01:35:20,354 --> 01:35:22,474
If I cannot arrange it..

910
01:35:23,034 --> 01:35:26,394
Our respect will be soon
dragged in dirt.

911
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:31,194
Great! Suddenly you care
for family respect?

912
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:40,274
Friend, my life is at your
disposal. Take this coach.

913
01:35:41,394 --> 01:35:44,234
I cannot snatch your daily bread
and earn my lively hood.

914
01:35:45,034 --> 01:35:47,754
Now I will work myself and earn
my living. Understood, friend.

915
01:35:48,714 --> 01:35:50,114
It is only a question of time.

916
01:35:53,274 --> 01:35:55,914
Pipe down, why are you
unnecessarily making noise.

917
01:35:55,994 --> 01:35:57,874
I know him. Wait.

918
01:35:59,674 --> 01:36:02,394
Why are you going in a coach,
when you have this car.

919
01:36:05,554 --> 01:36:07,114
I understand your problem.

920
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:09,394
Who doesn't require
money in Bombay.

921
01:36:10,314 --> 01:36:12,274
Here, take this Rs 10000..

922
01:36:12,354 --> 01:36:15,514
Go and start some thing
in another city.

923
01:36:17,234 --> 01:36:25,194
Rs 10000? I do need the money.
I don't want to pawn my love.

924
01:36:25,594 --> 01:36:28,914
If not pawn, sell your love.
You want some more money?

925
01:36:29,594 --> 01:36:31,274
Here is another Rs 5000.

926
01:36:34,154 --> 01:36:35,194
Rs.15000?

927
01:36:36,674 --> 01:36:38,314
It is big money Kumar.

928
01:36:39,034 --> 01:36:42,474
Whatever it is,
you look a very interesting man.

929
01:36:43,594 --> 01:36:44,714
And big hearted also.

930
01:36:50,514 --> 01:36:52,954
You want to trade in love?

931
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:59,354
Go, keep your money under the
pillow and dream of girls.

932
01:36:59,514 --> 01:37:03,954
Love can never be traded,
Go from here.

933
01:37:05,474 --> 01:37:09,594
Whatever it is, we should not
back out of our decision.

934
01:37:13,114 --> 01:37:18,954
- Uncle has come.
- Get in all of you.

935
01:37:55,154 --> 01:37:57,914
- I have come to meet you.
- Why?

936
01:37:58,114 --> 01:37:59,274
I have paid my rent.

937
01:37:59,634 --> 01:38:03,394
All the people of the building
have sent me a complaint.

938
01:38:04,114 --> 01:38:08,434
You have been cheating them.
They don't want you to stay here

939
01:38:17,714 --> 01:38:22,834
When I used to lie, they used
to love me, what do you want?

940
01:38:23,194 --> 01:38:25,514
You will have to vacate
this room. When?

941
01:38:25,714 --> 01:38:28,034
Today, if possible now!

942
01:38:28,634 --> 01:38:32,754
It means there is no place for
a person who says the truth!

943
01:38:33,154 --> 01:38:36,674
Tell this to others,
first vacate this room.

944
01:38:36,754 --> 01:38:38,674
Why do u act pompous?

945
01:38:39,154 --> 01:38:45,394
Why room, I will leave this life,
but all these people I love.

946
01:38:45,914 --> 01:38:47,554
I love them more than my life.

947
01:38:48,474 --> 01:38:52,634
I gave them nothing when
they gave me love.

948
01:38:52,954 --> 01:38:54,874
I am grateful to all of them.

949
01:38:55,274 --> 01:38:56,554
You know..

950
01:38:57,634 --> 01:39:01,994
Somehow I am indebted
to them all.

951
01:39:03,434 --> 01:39:06,514
Today why do you want to
humiliate me in front of them?

952
01:39:07,594 --> 01:39:11,954
Wait downstairs.
I will pack and come down.

953
01:39:17,474 --> 01:39:22,914
Ashok, had you not told lies,
this day would not have come.

954
01:39:41,434 --> 01:39:45,434
- Please forgive me, I am going.
- Go, get away from here.

955
01:39:50,794 --> 01:39:55,114
Eat! Has your mother died
that you are not eating?

956
01:39:56,514 --> 01:40:00,994
- Sister!
- You have no sister here. Eat you brats.

957
01:40:28,554 --> 01:40:30,954
Go and take over the room.
It is empty.

958
01:40:31,594 --> 01:40:34,354
Now you can make an extra
amount on deposit.

959
01:40:47,154 --> 01:40:50,914
- Uncle why are you leaving?
- Speak uncle

960
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:53,754
Why are you leaving the colony?

961
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:55,514
Tell me.

962
01:40:55,594 --> 01:40:57,274
Why are you quiet? Tell us.

963
01:40:59,794 --> 01:41:03,874
I am not leaving.
In fact everybody has left me.

964
01:41:03,954 --> 01:41:06,714
Uncle,
why do people call you a liar.

965
01:41:08,874 --> 01:41:10,714
Because I have stopped
telling lies.

966
01:41:11,034 --> 01:41:15,434
Uncle, I have brought you a
sweet, I stole from my house.

967
01:41:17,994 --> 01:41:19,034
For me?

968
01:41:23,914 --> 01:41:28,114
You have not stolen a sweet,
you have stolen my heart.

969
01:41:30,514 --> 01:41:34,274
- All of you come up.
- Don't talk to that liar!

970
01:41:39,954 --> 01:41:47,234
Go. Your mother is calling you.
I will return one day. Go.

971
01:41:47,514 --> 01:41:48,834
Go, mother is calling you.

972
01:41:49,114 --> 01:41:51,154
Always listen to your mother.

973
01:41:54,074 --> 01:41:55,634
Go. Go.

974
01:42:27,234 --> 01:42:35,234
Hey heart, today nobody is
mine and I am nobody's.

975
01:43:09,954 --> 01:43:17,434
When I walked a crooked path,
the world loved me.

976
01:43:24,834 --> 01:43:31,834
When I found the path of truth,
the world forgets me.

977
01:44:05,154 --> 01:44:12,714
Nobody knows what I want,
and nobody waits for me.

978
01:44:20,114 --> 01:44:27,074
That is why one tends to look
back time and again.

979
01:45:17,154 --> 01:45:19,154
- What is the purpose of this?
- Your blood.

980
01:45:19,474 --> 01:45:23,954
Why are you wasting time.
I have a thick skin.

981
01:45:24,714 --> 01:45:28,034
And you won't find a
penny in my pocket.

982
01:45:28,554 --> 01:45:31,794
You want money, look elsewhere.
You want to get away talking.

983
01:45:37,474 --> 01:45:42,514
- Who sent you? Speak up!
- Ok, I will talk.

984
01:45:46,994 --> 01:45:52,754
Jwala Prasad, two for one who
is dying. What is happening?

985
01:45:53,034 --> 01:45:56,274
You have not even one and
your hands are shaking.

986
01:45:57,434 --> 01:46:03,354
I am feeling nervous. Kumar,
Your telephone hasn't come.

987
01:46:08,114 --> 01:46:09,634
Why are you standing
like a thief?

988
01:46:10,674 --> 01:46:12,194
What are you doing?

989
01:46:16,554 --> 01:46:19,434
You are staying in a place where
Dacoits and murderers stay.

990
01:46:19,754 --> 01:46:21,554
- Which Dacoits?
- Just listen.

991
01:46:28,114 --> 01:46:30,834
The telephone is as dead as
Ashok whose body must be..

992
01:46:31,194 --> 01:46:33,234
Lying some where.

993
01:46:33,954 --> 01:46:35,954
It is a matter of murder,
Mr. Kumar.

994
01:46:36,114 --> 01:46:40,474
So what, you are not new in
this school of murder.

995
01:46:41,394 --> 01:46:43,674
A person who can kill
his brother..

996
01:46:44,434 --> 01:46:47,314
Why should he worry about a small
murder such as this one.

997
01:46:47,514 --> 01:46:50,834
- Don't keep referring to it time and again.
- Why not?

998
01:46:51,594 --> 01:46:54,634
- Memories are refreshed.
- Enough.

999
01:46:57,434 --> 01:47:00,754
A small mistake,
and now I am branded for life.

1000
01:47:01,914 --> 01:47:05,914
You are getting annoyed
unnecessarily.

1001
01:47:06,714 --> 01:47:11,954
We are partners now. After
Seema's marriage it will be 50-50.

1002
01:47:12,074 --> 01:47:16,354
Now you have heard it yourself!
Have believed me.

1003
01:47:17,154 --> 01:47:23,874
I cannot understand what is
happening. After all why?

1004
01:47:24,074 --> 01:47:28,874
They want to cheat you.
Look, I am very grateful to you.

1005
01:47:29,274 --> 01:47:31,594
You have helped my mother..

1006
01:47:32,594 --> 01:47:35,634
I have this opportunity to
repay my debt to you..

1007
01:47:36,634 --> 01:47:39,834
If you agree I can help.
I have an idea.

1008
01:47:40,554 --> 01:47:41,874
What have I to do in it?

1009
01:47:42,434 --> 01:47:45,714
We stage a small drama by..

1010
01:47:45,914 --> 01:47:48,874
Which they are convinced
we hate each other.

1011
01:47:49,314 --> 01:47:51,234
And the effect will be..

1012
01:47:51,594 --> 01:47:55,674
Jwala Prasad,
you take the last drink

1013
01:47:58,554 --> 01:48:04,634
- Uncle, are you all right?
- Why dear, I am all right.

1014
01:48:06,474 --> 01:48:07,634
Thank god.

1015
01:48:08,394 --> 01:48:09,914
I just has a bad dream.

1016
01:48:11,394 --> 01:48:17,434
I dreamt somebody was chasing
you with a knife.

1017
01:48:17,714 --> 01:48:21,314
Beautiful people should not
have such horrible dreams.

1018
01:48:21,554 --> 01:48:24,354
Take this hanky and wipe
away your tears.

1019
01:48:24,434 --> 01:48:28,554
- Such dreams have no meaning.
- But my dreams always come true.

1020
01:48:28,634 --> 01:48:33,194
- But this time I am right.
- Uncle, I am scared.

1021
01:48:33,594 --> 01:48:40,354
- In the dream I saw your dead body.
- My corpse!

1022
01:48:40,554 --> 01:48:48,074
Yes. And you were shouting
'Please save me, save me.'

1023
01:48:51,234 --> 01:48:58,554
And the murderer was saying
'Now God can't save you'

1024
01:49:00,474 --> 01:49:03,554
Jwala Prasad,
you are trembling like a child.

1025
01:49:04,274 --> 01:49:08,794
Look Seema,
if you feel scared, get married.

1026
01:49:08,954 --> 01:49:11,794
And even if you still
feel scared..

1027
01:49:11,874 --> 01:49:15,114
There'd be some one
to reassure you.

1028
01:49:20,914 --> 01:49:23,794
Ashok! Save me, save me.

1029
01:49:23,954 --> 01:49:27,714
Ashok, you want to kill my Uncle?

1030
01:49:28,514 --> 01:49:34,914
Not me, your uncle wants to.
I could never imagine..

1031
01:49:35,354 --> 01:49:37,514
For the small quarrel we had..

1032
01:49:37,594 --> 01:49:40,034
You asked your uncle
to murder me?

1033
01:49:40,474 --> 01:49:45,314
Here is the knife your
uncle sent to kill me.

1034
01:49:45,434 --> 01:49:47,474
Shut up,
do you think we are so fallen..

1035
01:49:47,554 --> 01:49:49,154
That we will stoop to murder!

1036
01:49:49,434 --> 01:49:51,194
What do you think of my uncle?

1037
01:49:51,554 --> 01:49:56,194
In fact you are a goon
& lust for money.

1038
01:49:56,274 --> 01:50:00,554
Fault is mine that
I befriended you!

1039
01:50:02,274 --> 01:50:04,914
Not yours,
fault is mine that I had..

1040
01:50:04,994 --> 01:50:07,194
Relations with such a family..

1041
01:50:07,594 --> 01:50:10,034
Who value everything with money.

1042
01:50:11,634 --> 01:50:13,274
Now I know the real you.

1043
01:50:13,354 --> 01:50:15,994
From today I'll never
enter this house.

1044
01:50:22,754 --> 01:50:28,394
Seema, do you now realise
how bad this man is.

1045
01:50:28,874 --> 01:50:35,194
I had told you not to let
this man come near you.

1046
01:50:37,034 --> 01:50:41,354
You were right.
The fault was mine.

1047
01:50:42,674 --> 01:50:44,434
Forgive me.

1048
01:50:45,194 --> 01:50:47,914
Now on I will listen to you.

1049
01:50:48,514 --> 01:50:52,274
You decide now where & to
whom should I get married

1050
01:50:54,634 --> 01:50:58,834
Congrats. Lala, the girl has
come on line on her own.

1051
01:51:00,594 --> 01:51:05,034
Then should I start the
marriage preparations?

1052
01:51:06,514 --> 01:51:10,874
But at least now you can
return the photographs.

1053
01:51:11,114 --> 01:51:16,954
Lala, here are the positives
and negatives of the photos.

1054
01:51:17,514 --> 01:51:20,034
I consider a word given
as above everything.

1055
01:51:20,114 --> 01:51:22,394
I hope you don't have
any more copies.

1056
01:51:22,474 --> 01:51:28,154
Lala, there is honesty amongst
thieves. Please trust me.

1057
01:51:32,754 --> 01:51:38,594
Well done, today you are not
burning & I too am relaxed.

1058
01:51:43,114 --> 01:51:44,674
May I come in please?

1059
01:51:48,034 --> 01:51:52,274
- Am I dreaming?
- First permit me to enter.

1060
01:51:54,194 --> 01:52:00,914
I cannot imagine! Please come in.

1061
01:52:00,994 --> 01:52:04,234
No, first say you forgive me.

1062
01:52:04,514 --> 01:52:07,194
First say what fault
have you committed.

1063
01:52:08,314 --> 01:52:10,194
My fault is I did
not trust a man..

1064
01:52:10,274 --> 01:52:12,154
Like you and involved myself ..

1065
01:52:12,234 --> 01:52:14,194
With a cheat and bluffmaster.

1066
01:52:14,434 --> 01:52:15,514
Forget all this.

1067
01:52:15,594 --> 01:52:18,834
As long as you have returned
all is forgotten.

1068
01:52:19,434 --> 01:52:21,114
And returned in such
a way there will..

1069
01:52:21,194 --> 01:52:23,674
Be never a thought of leaving
-Great thoughts.

1070
01:52:25,914 --> 01:52:30,474
Now please.. First tell
me you accept me or not

1071
01:52:30,554 --> 01:52:32,314
What are you saying?

1072
01:52:32,514 --> 01:52:36,954
If darkness gets light,
will it ever reject it?

1073
01:52:37,194 --> 01:52:39,074
Then should I give the
good news to Uncle..

1074
01:52:39,914 --> 01:52:42,794
That you will permit
me to serve you.

1075
01:52:43,274 --> 01:52:45,354
Don't say that.
I will place you in my heart.

1076
01:52:45,434 --> 01:52:48,634
Yes, & tell him to fix
the marriage date.

1077
01:52:50,234 --> 01:52:52,114
I too am interested in
a quick marriage.

1078
01:52:52,874 --> 01:52:55,074
I want to teach that
Ashok a lesson..

1079
01:52:55,154 --> 01:52:56,874
Which he will never forget.

1080
01:52:57,154 --> 01:53:02,394
Leave it Seema,
he will suffer on his own.

1081
01:53:02,474 --> 01:53:05,274
Just forgive & forget.

1082
01:53:05,794 --> 01:53:11,394
Uncle has agreed on one
small condition.

1083
01:53:11,514 --> 01:53:14,794
Every wish will be fulfilled.
Tell me.

1084
01:53:15,794 --> 01:53:18,714
He wants all my property
transferred..

1085
01:53:18,794 --> 01:53:21,474
In his name before the marriage.

1086
01:53:21,714 --> 01:53:25,714
So that is his small condition!

1087
01:53:26,114 --> 01:53:30,274
Yes, but how are you worried
about my property!

1088
01:53:31,194 --> 01:53:33,754
- Write it down.
- No need for money.

1089
01:53:34,074 --> 01:53:41,634
Ur uncle doesn't have a wife or
kids, then why is this greed?

1090
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:50,114
But I too am not a kid.
I have a copy still with me.

1091
01:53:50,874 --> 01:53:52,634
- Copy?
- Yes, a copy of the photo.

1092
01:53:52,794 --> 01:53:56,194
Don't worry on this. I will just
now sort out that old man.

1093
01:53:56,474 --> 01:53:57,954
Not now.

1094
01:53:59,274 --> 01:54:02,274
In the morning we talk
of love not war.

1095
01:54:02,954 --> 01:54:04,234
Talk in the evening.

1096
01:54:04,794 --> 01:54:06,954
But don't take my name.

1097
01:54:07,794 --> 01:54:10,954
And today we have started
a new life.

1098
01:54:11,714 --> 01:54:13,354
Teach me a new Spanish dance.

1099
01:54:13,714 --> 01:54:19,634
- Not now. It is time for romance.
- No, take me now.

1100
01:54:19,794 --> 01:54:21,274
Come on.

1101
01:54:35,234 --> 01:54:38,674
No, that statement is all wrong.
See this side.

1102
01:54:38,994 --> 01:54:46,914
This is Seema my friend and
a first class dancer.

1103
01:54:47,034 --> 01:54:49,274
What are you saying!

1104
01:54:49,554 --> 01:54:54,234
- Well a small dance for my sake.
- No, I won't dance.

1105
01:54:54,754 --> 01:54:59,874
Well if Ashok asked
you would dance.

1106
01:55:00,434 --> 01:55:03,074
Today when I ask, your refuse.

1107
01:55:04,354 --> 01:55:07,514
Now I am your fiancee!

1108
01:55:07,794 --> 01:55:13,474
- Mr Kumar, what are you doing? Quiet.
- Don't utter a word.

1109
01:55:14,394 --> 01:55:17,274
If you interfere then what will
we do? I'll break your bones.

1110
01:55:21,554 --> 01:55:24,674
I will pay for your loss. Ok?

1111
01:55:24,754 --> 01:55:25,994
Fine.

1112
01:55:26,714 --> 01:55:31,394
Ok, Mr Kumar. If you are
insisting I will dance.

1113
01:55:33,914 --> 01:55:36,994
Ok, go to the dressing
room and get ready.

1114
01:55:45,354 --> 01:55:48,114
See the result of insulting me.

1115
01:55:48,194 --> 01:55:50,794
You had declined to come
with me on that day.

1116
01:56:25,794 --> 01:56:29,714
Since I have known you,
my life has gone.

1117
01:56:34,514 --> 01:56:38,834
My heart fell in love.

1118
01:57:12,274 --> 01:57:17,354
My lover is very aggressive.

1119
01:57:20,794 --> 01:57:28,794
My lover is very aggressive.
How should I come out of this?

1120
01:57:29,634 --> 01:57:37,634
Seeing his style,
my heart was hurt

1121
01:58:19,874 --> 01:58:24,674
Hundred appeals lie
In just one glance.

1122
01:58:37,234 --> 01:58:45,234
I am a boat and you are my shore!

1123
01:58:49,674 --> 01:58:53,914
Since I have known you,
since then my life has gone.

1124
01:58:54,034 --> 01:58:57,754
My heart has fallen in love.

1125
01:59:20,554 --> 01:59:25,594
Seema, come!
Uncle I am very happy today.

1126
01:59:27,554 --> 01:59:32,874
You know despite all this
Mr. Kumar wants to marry me.

1127
01:59:32,954 --> 01:59:34,034
That's good.

1128
01:59:34,194 --> 01:59:38,154
But he was saying a very
strange thing today.

1129
01:59:39,434 --> 01:59:44,114
Before marriage everything should
be transferred to his name.

1130
01:59:44,314 --> 01:59:47,034
What? In name of Mr Kumar.

1131
01:59:47,834 --> 01:59:49,594
And that too before marriage?

1132
01:59:50,274 --> 01:59:52,194
Yes. In a way he is right.

1133
01:59:52,274 --> 01:59:55,074
After marriage too,
all will be his.

1134
01:59:55,714 --> 02:00:00,394
You are still a child. Your good
or bad, I would know better

1135
02:00:01,314 --> 02:00:09,314
Yes, who will know better. After
father, you looked after me.

1136
02:00:11,994 --> 02:00:15,674
Uncle he was saying
another thing.

1137
02:00:16,034 --> 02:00:19,074
- What was he saying?
- Something about papers.

1138
02:00:19,474 --> 02:00:20,514
- Papers?
- Yes.

1139
02:00:21,194 --> 02:00:25,594
He has a paper which can put
you into a lot of trouble.

1140
02:00:26,074 --> 02:00:27,234
I didn't understand.

1141
02:00:28,954 --> 02:00:34,154
Well, I just worry..

1142
02:00:34,914 --> 02:00:37,434
What will happen to you
after my marriage.

1143
02:00:42,874 --> 02:00:46,834
Well here are 5 lakh rupees.
They are yours.

1144
02:00:48,794 --> 02:00:56,714
But tell anything to Mr Kumar.
Now I am going out. Take it.

1145
02:01:04,514 --> 02:01:08,354
- Have you come to meet uncle?
- See how the meeting takes place

1146
02:01:08,514 --> 02:01:13,114
Leave it Kumar. For my love,
give me one more assurance.

1147
02:01:13,434 --> 02:01:16,314
With your love,
don't try to cool me down!

1148
02:01:17,514 --> 02:01:20,394
Here you are angry,
and there uncle is angry.

1149
02:01:20,754 --> 02:01:24,074
You will fight and what
will happen to me.

1150
02:01:24,714 --> 02:01:26,754
Look, I beg of you..

1151
02:01:27,434 --> 02:01:31,514
- If uncle has taken 24 lakhs just ignore it.
- What!

1152
02:01:37,514 --> 02:01:40,074
Are you airing the notes,
or counting them.

1153
02:01:44,834 --> 02:01:48,714
Perhaps I have come before time.

1154
02:01:49,074 --> 02:01:53,154
How are you keeping the notes?

1155
02:01:53,434 --> 02:01:58,314
This is not my money.
I am just paying Income Tax.

1156
02:02:00,434 --> 02:02:03,594
I have bought the Income Tax
office. Give the money.

1157
02:02:03,794 --> 02:02:04,914
- No!
- Give.

1158
02:02:09,074 --> 02:02:11,514
Living in water, you want to
challenge the crocodile.

1159
02:02:11,994 --> 02:02:13,914
Playing a double game with me!

1160
02:02:14,794 --> 02:02:18,314
Not me,
you are playing a double game.

1161
02:02:18,674 --> 02:02:25,474
Did you not promise that you
will return all the proof.

1162
02:02:25,714 --> 02:02:26,874
I returned all but one!

1163
02:02:27,194 --> 02:02:30,354
But kept only one important
evidence.

1164
02:02:31,074 --> 02:02:33,634
If I hadn't you would
have vanished today!!

1165
02:02:34,394 --> 02:02:40,074
Kumar, now it's time for
you to disappear.

1166
02:02:41,594 --> 02:02:46,634
It would have been better if
I had finished you earlier.

1167
02:02:51,954 --> 02:02:56,834
Don't threaten.
Kumar has a chest of steel!

1168
02:02:57,594 --> 02:03:00,514
Then we will know only
after firing a round.

1169
02:03:29,834 --> 02:03:32,914
- What are you doing here?
- I was involved with Kumar's goons

1170
02:03:32,994 --> 02:03:34,234
Your friend hasn't come.

1171
02:03:35,714 --> 02:03:37,874
You go to the police station,
I will fetch mother.

1172
02:03:45,514 --> 02:03:47,554
Is your mother's life more
precious or the tape?

1173
02:03:55,554 --> 02:03:58,994
You forgot whom are
you fighting with!

1174
02:03:59,794 --> 02:04:04,354
- What do you want?
- At this time you are a beggar, not me.

1175
02:04:04,674 --> 02:04:09,194
Are you not ashamed,
putting a mothers life at stake?

1176
02:04:09,274 --> 02:04:11,034
Everything is fair
in love and war.

1177
02:04:14,914 --> 02:04:19,914
But I admit you are cunning
as well as beautiful.

1178
02:04:20,914 --> 02:04:22,914
With your cunningness
you caused..

1179
02:04:22,994 --> 02:04:24,914
Split between your uncle & me.

1180
02:04:25,714 --> 02:04:29,314
You lost nothing but your
uncle lost his life.

1181
02:04:31,394 --> 02:04:35,114
Now to save your own life, one
more will have to be finished.

1182
02:04:37,434 --> 02:04:42,594
If your thirst is quenched
with blood, take my life.

1183
02:04:42,754 --> 02:04:43,914
Don't say that mother.

1184
02:04:45,514 --> 02:04:48,314
You want to put a price on my
mother's life? Spell it out!

1185
02:04:49,194 --> 02:04:51,034
It is a small amount.

1186
02:04:52,034 --> 02:04:55,194
You will accept responsibility
of Uncle's murder.

1187
02:05:02,274 --> 02:05:04,674
I will accept this for
my mothers life.

1188
02:05:09,034 --> 02:05:15,914
No, you have sworn to walk the
path of truth. Don't ever lie.

1189
02:05:16,914 --> 02:05:18,394
There is one more way.

1190
02:05:18,914 --> 02:05:22,594
Seema, what sacrifice can
you give for your love..

1191
02:05:23,194 --> 02:05:24,794
Jewels or your family line.

1192
02:05:28,394 --> 02:05:30,234
I am ready to give
whatever I have.

1193
02:05:30,474 --> 02:05:32,114
Then take out whatever you have.

1194
02:05:32,554 --> 02:05:35,754
I have nothing here.
Everything is in the bank.

1195
02:05:35,834 --> 02:05:40,034
I don't deal in cheques.
Give the tape.

1196
02:05:43,314 --> 02:05:45,154
A million for this life.

1197
02:05:46,634 --> 02:05:51,594
Bring the money to the caves,
& you will get your mother back.

1198
02:05:51,674 --> 02:05:52,714
I accept.

1199
02:06:00,794 --> 02:06:06,794
Seema, why are you losing
everything for me.

1200
02:06:08,314 --> 02:06:11,314
- Can't I do this much for mother.
- What happened?

1201
02:06:11,394 --> 02:06:14,954
I will tell you later,
there is little time now.

1202
02:06:20,074 --> 02:06:24,074
Mr Kumar has kidnapped
Ashok's mother..

1203
02:06:24,154 --> 02:06:27,074
& is asking for a million!

1204
02:06:28,594 --> 02:06:32,274
Your name? I am Mohan Choti
I am Ashok's friend.

1205
02:06:50,754 --> 02:06:53,034
Come. Come out!

1206
02:09:33,554 --> 02:09:35,114
No, son, no.

1207
02:10:52,714 --> 02:10:55,874
Fake notes, you are trying to
make a monkey out of me.

1208
02:11:14,714 --> 02:11:17,194
I tell you, leave me.

1209
02:12:44,954 --> 02:12:49,354
Mr Kumar,
will you take a cheque or cash?

1210
02:12:52,394 --> 02:12:54,154
Mother!

1211
02:13:02,554 --> 02:13:04,874
My Dabbu!

1212
02:13:08,314 --> 02:13:14,514
Dabbu's mother's would be
daughter in law, come here.

1213
02:13:15,874 --> 02:13:16,914
Come her..

1214
02:13:22,914 --> 02:13:25,194
Touch mothers feet.

1215
02:13:27,954 --> 02:13:35,954
Govinda has come, take care of
the butter pot, Brijbala.
