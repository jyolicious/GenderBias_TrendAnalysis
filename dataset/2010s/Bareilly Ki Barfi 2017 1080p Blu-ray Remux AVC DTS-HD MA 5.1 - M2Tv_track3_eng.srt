1
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,750
'Ekta Nagar, Bareilly.'

2
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,750
Of all the houses in
this neighborhood, the most unique...'

3
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,458
'...or, you can say the most
amusing is Mishra Sadan.'

4
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,875
'Because her the
morning is not normal.

5
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:38,875
The evening is not normal

6
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:39,958
'Nor are the people normal.'

7
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,750
Shushila...

8
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,625
Where is my cigarette?

9
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,875
Last night there was one left
in the packet. Now it's disappeared!

10
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,708
Oh, God...
I can't take a dump without it.

11
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,250
And, I’ve to make an urgent
delivery to Bijoriya today.

12
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,250
If I don't freshen up now and suddenly
the pressure increases on the way...

13
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,125
... I'll be in big trouble.

14
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,875
Go ask Bitti for a cigarette.
Tell her it's urgent.

15
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,750
How would Bitti have a cigarette?

16
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,500
She smokes!!!

17
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,125
... go-go...

18
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,750
This was the only thing
missing in her life now.

19
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,500
God save us from such a daughter.
- Just wait and watch...

20
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,375
Soon, you'll find bottles
of country liquor.

21
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:26,625
Bitti! Still sleeping!!

22
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:28,625
Wake up.

23
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing, sweetheart?

24
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,375
Get up! queen of sweetheart

25
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:35,458
what mummy!! it was such a nice dream.

26
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,333
That's all you do.

27
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:39,500
Bitti!

28
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,833
Bitti!

29
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,000
What?

30
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,625
Do you have a cigarette?
- Huh!

31
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,625
Since when did you start smoking?

32
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,083
Your father wants one.
- l don't smoke.

33
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:51,875
Don't lie.
If you have one. Give me it me now!

34
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,083
I said I don't smoke.
Wanna bet.

35
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,875
Your father has to go to Bijoriya.

36
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,708
He can't take a dump.
- What can l do?

37
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:02,125
He will be big trouble
if he has to go on the way.

38
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,250
I'll go and ask someone.

39
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:09,500
I knew it...you only
stole my cigarette.

40
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,625
Scream a little louder. The pressure will
increase, it will happens on it's own.

41
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,375
Uncle, papa needs one urgently.
- I've only one, dear.

42
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:21,625
It's ok.

43
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:33,708
Where's papa?

44
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,000
Any luck?

45
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:41,500
Here you go.

46
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,958
Thank you, Bitti.

47
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,416
Wash your hands.
- But, I didn't take a dump.

48
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,750
Doesn't matter.

49
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,125
I drank that water.
- I’m only washing my hands.

50
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,500
'This is Bitti Mishra.'

51
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:02,500
'Daughter of Mrs. Sushila Mishra.'

52
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,833
'And son of Mr. Narhottam Mishra.'

53
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,833
'After all,
he has raised her like a son only.'

54
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:16,041
'Sushila Mishra... teaches
children at Narmada Primary School...'

55
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:19,000
'...what Bitti Mishra
never learned in her life.'

56
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:23,500
Always listen to your elders...

57
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,750
'And Narhottam Mishra's words...

58
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,625
...are sweeter than his sweets.'
- Isn't shanu my daughter too?

59
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,875
what if you run out
of sweets at her wedding...

60
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,708
...won't I feel humiliated as well?

61
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,375
Son, add 5 more kilos.

62
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,833
I'll be right back.

63
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,375
Bitti, who is this crow?

64
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,791
He's not a crow.
He's a peacock.

65
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,041
Must have not taken a bath today.

66
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,250
But, who is he?
- He's from our neighborhood.

67
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,000
My bike was out of fuel.

68
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,375
I asked for a lift and he obliged.

69
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:52,333
I said 'Drop me', he said okay.

70
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,125
Enough of that, give me 100 rupees.

71
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:56,750
l don't have.
You get a fat salary.

72
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:00,250
l bought you this
sweater from my salary right?

73
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:02,500
Take it off.

74
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,125
Listen, Bitti.

75
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:13,375
Sit on a motorcycle,
with both your legs on one side.

76
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,500
'Bitti Mishra...
never listens to advice.'

77
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:21,083
'Doesn't have too many good habits.'

78
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:24,750
'She once ate non-veg
unintentionally.'

79
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,833
'Now she eats at every
opportunity.'

80
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:33,250
In lndia it has not even released.

81
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,958
English films
are locally premiered...

82
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:40,208
'...at her best friend
Rama's boutique.'

83
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,916
'She understands only 60 percent...'

84
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,666
...but explains 100 percent.'

85
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,041
'l want to break up with you.'

86
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,333
I want to break you.

87
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,875
'Are you kidding me?'
- Have you become mad?

88
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,416
The electricity keeps
going in the lanes...'

89
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:55,666
'...and Bitti's tape keeps
playing without a break.'

90
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,000
There's a power cut in the entire city
but it will be restored soon enough.

91
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,291
We regret the inconvenience caused.

92
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,541
But there's electricity
at our neighbor's home.

93
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:04,250
Uncle, they have an inverter,
you should also buy one.

94
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:08,166
'And just not these
good for nothing boys...

95
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,500
'...but, the entire neighborhood
is a fan of her break dance.'

96
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,875
Any wedding when the DJ starts,

97
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,208
'...Bitti's feet start
tapping on its own.'

98
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:30,875
"Munni your anklet...
tinkles with the beat."

99
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:34,958
"Munni your bracelet...
sparkles like diamond."

100
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,750
"Munni... Munni..."

101
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,916
"Munni your anklet...
tinkles with the beat."

102
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:47,083
"Munni your bracelet...
sparkles like diamond."

103
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:50,500
"Boy's can never take
their eyes off your balcony..."

104
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:53,500
"...and try to sway like you do."

105
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,625
"Your waist twists..."

106
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,916
"Your waist twists like this..."

107
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:03,000
"Your waist twists..."

108
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,500
"Your waist twists like this..."

109
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:22,125
"Mischievous eyes, vivacious body."

110
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:25,291
"When she sways, even stars
come out to play."

111
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:28,541
"Bachelors can't stop falling
in love with her attitude."

112
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:32,166
"People can't stop raving
about her grace."

113
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,375
"Boy's can never take
their eyes off your balcony..."

114
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:38,125
"...and try to sway like you do."

115
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,375
"Your waist twists..."

116
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,625
"Your waist twists like this..."

117
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,916
"Your waist twists..."

118
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:51,333
"Your waist twists like this..."

119
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,583
"Twist!"

120
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:02,750
"Your waist twists like this..."

121
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,375
Aarush, have a sweet.

122
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:12,000
No aunty, I don't eat sweets.

123
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,916
Why don't both of you
speak in private, son?

124
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:16,875
Okay Aunty.

125
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,375
Go...Speak to him.

126
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:21,625
Go.

127
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:29,958
Our daughter Bitti works at the
Electricity board's Complaint Department.

128
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:34,000
The Complaint Department gets
hundreds of complaints every day.

129
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,750
But, not a single complaint
against our daughter Bitti.

130
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,833
It occasionally happens in parties...

131
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,000
...otherwise, I don't drink.

132
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,250
I just wanted to ask you one question.

133
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:49,833
Ask.

134
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,375
Are you a...

135
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:55,500
Are you... a virgin?

136
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:01,000
Virgin..?

137
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:05,250
Are you?

138
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,125
It doesn't matter...

139
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,125
But, it does matter
whether you are or not!

140
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,708
No, I’m not! Now?

141
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,875
So many boys have met her,
but they all rejected her.

142
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,708
There must be something
wrong with our girl.

143
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,583
If I try talking to her,
she gets angry.

144
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:26,375
And you don't know how to.
- What do I do?

145
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,625
This is entirely your fault.

146
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:30,708
She behaves like a guy.

147
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,250
We should've had a boy instead.

148
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:34,791
Now where are you going?

149
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,125
'But there's one thing...'

150
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,166
'...that always bother's
Bitti's mother.'

151
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,458
'Bitti can't find a suitor.'

152
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,833
'Her engagement was canceled twice.'

153
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:55,083
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

154
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,833
Dear...don't take your
mother too seriously.

155
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,625
She loves you lot.

156
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,250
You know she has thyroid.

157
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:20,125
Constant mood swings,
and can't stop bickering.

158
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,375
Papa, can l ask you something?

159
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,958
Everything would've been
much easier if l was a boy.

160
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,375
No questions asked.

161
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:41,250
"He smokes cigarettes.
But, he's a boy."

162
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,833
"Wanders out all night."

163
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,958
"But boys normally do, don't they?"

164
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,875
"He's a loudmouth,
but has a heart of gold."

165
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,500
"So what if his engagement
got canceled twice."

166
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:03,125
"He didn't like the girl."

167
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,625
"He just can't marry anyone."

168
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:14,125
Being a girl is a complete disaster.

169
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,500
Dear, that's how the society is.

170
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,500
I don't believe in their norms, but...

171
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,375
...we still have
to live in this society.

172
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:54,458
Stop...stop...

173
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,958
Stop, Need a drop to the station?
- Come.

174
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,583
Ticket.
- Where to?

175
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:12,625
Anywhere.

176
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,833
Anywhere?
- Yes.

177
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,958
Are you traveling alone, madam?
- Yes.

178
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:28,375
Where?

179
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,833
To my mother's home.

180
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:31,958
Home?

181
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:36,041
No Bindi. No mangalsutra.
You don't look like a bride at all.

182
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,583
I am Christian.

183
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:42,208
Oh, Christian! Happy journey.

184
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:51,916
"The train travelling
to Jaam Nagar..."

185
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:57,458
"No..1 4 6 7 4."

186
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,250
"Shaheed Express..."

187
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,583
"...from it's actual time."

188
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:05,375
"...is delayed by two hours."

189
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:09,333
"We regret the inconvenience
caused to passengers."

190
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,125
Brother

191
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,250
Oh! Brother

192
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,833
Brotherrr!!!

193
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes.
- How much is that book for?

194
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:24,583
Which one?
- The One that woke you up.

195
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,625
150 rupees.
- 150?

196
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:36,083
Don't you have anything cheaper?
- Cheaper...

197
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,083
How about this one?

198
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,833
It's worth 80,
but I'll charge you only 60.

199
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,833
'Bareilly Ki Barfi.'

200
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,583
Fine...
I'll give it to you for 50.

201
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:51,083
Nothing less than 40,
I am sorry...No ...

202
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:53,958
Fine...30.

203
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:57,625
30 rupees.

204
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,708
Mummy...

205
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,041
I am going away, Mummy.

206
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:53,750
This is the only best way to save papa
and you from all the trouble.

207
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:58,250
l am also taking along
with me 2000 rupees...

208
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:02,291
...which you had
hidden in your bIouse.

209
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:07,416
Please don't try
finding the money or me!

210
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,458
Your headache.

211
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,500
Bitti...

212
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,375
Where do you think
you were running away, witch?

213
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:18,541
Running away from home.

214
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,833
Then why didn't you?

215
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,208
Because I can't see your happiness

216
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,375
You know how much
l will beat you...if..

217
00:16:23,376 --> 00:16:24,958
If you're done with
'north south pole' emotional hug...

218
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,916
...then, make some tea for me
without sugar.

219
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,208
Rama. Ra...

220
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,750
Have you lost your mind?
Running away from home...

221
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,791
See, this will blow your mind away.

222
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,583
'Bareilly Ki Barfi.'
- Read more..

223
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,916
A few years ago, a popular international...
- Not the entire book.

224
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,583
Just read what I’ve highlighted.

225
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:48,916
Read this part.

226
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,375
"She stays in Bareilly."

227
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,208
"Enjoys break-dances."

228
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,458
"Secretly smokes cigarettes."

229
00:16:58,042 --> 00:17:00,083
"Always lays a 100
rupees bet in any chat."

230
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:02,708
Oh my God...that's you!

231
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,666
Bareilly Ki Barfi'...Bitti.

232
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,375
You won't believe...

233
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,791
He's written things,
only you and I know about.

234
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,125
Are you serious?
- Yes...

235
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,750
Then, he must have
written about me also.

236
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:15,083
Forget about you, and look at me.

237
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,791
This means...I am not the
only one who's this way.

238
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,458
And there's someone
in this world who thinks...

239
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,333
... I am what I am, it's perfect
and he likes just the way I am

240
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,583
Isn't it?
- Yes.

241
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:28,791
But...who's the author?

242
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,500
Turn.

243
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,666
Uff! Turn it around.

244
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:36,583
He's the author.

245
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,166
Pritam Vidrohi.

246
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,291
Do you know him?

247
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:49,208
'Now you must be thinking
this is Pritam Vidrohi.'

248
00:17:50,042 --> 00:17:51,041
'No...he is not'

249
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,791
'He's the only 'Chirag'
(Light) of his family.

250
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:55,291
Chirag Dubey.'

251
00:17:56,251 --> 00:18:00,500
'His father wanted him
to become a doctor or engineer...'

252
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,791
'...and mint money.'

253
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,541
'Well, he's still minting...'

254
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,083
'But pamphlets, visiting cards,
wedding cards,..

255
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:10,458
...etcetera in his
father's printing press'

256
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:14,041
It's not 'Wets'... it's 'Weds'.

257
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,916
'Works hard all day...'

258
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:20,708
'...and drinking
a peg in the evening,...

259
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,333
...with Babli.'

260
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,750
'You don't see Babli.'

261
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,666
'Ah! There she is.'

262
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,750
'They say time heals every wound.'

263
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,083
'But his wound is still ripe.'

264
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:40,833
'Five years ago...
Babli used to be in his arms...'

265
00:18:41,001 --> 00:18:42,708
'...and not just in his purse.'

266
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:46,291
'Lt was hard for him
to pass time without Babli...'

267
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,291
'...but, he was just a
time pass for Babli.'

268
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,375
Papa.

269
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:54,291
'At Babli's wedding,
he cried more than she did.'

270
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,333
'After losing the first innings...

271
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:01,208
...never mustered the courage
to play second.'

272
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,541
'Because he never
like anyone after that.'

273
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:07,625
'Because even today...he's trying to
find Babli in every girl.'

274
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:16,583
'The night Babli left him for good...'

275
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,791
'...that same night,
he took this unwavering oath...'

276
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,833
'...of making his
love-story immortal.'

277
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:28,625
'And his best friend
Munna read the first draft.'

278
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:31,833
Did you write this?

279
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,375
My tears made me.

280
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,500
Get your picture clicked, brother.

281
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,333
You'll need to publish
it with the book.

282
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:41,291
'But Chirag was a true lover.'

283
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:43,333
'lf he had published the
book with his own picture...'

284
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:45,083
'...then, Babli would be humiliated.'

285
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:47,625
'lf he had published
it with Munna's picture...'

286
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:49,458
'...then the book would've
been humiliated.'

287
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:51,791
'Now there only one...

288
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:54,083
'... so-called friend in the radar..'

289
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:00,708
But, you wrote this Chirag brother.
- Yes, so?

290
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,958
So how can you publish it in my name?
- Why not?

291
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:10,250
You can, but you shouldn't...
l mean...it's unfair.

292
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,291
Unfair is if l publish
this with your name...

293
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,625
...and there's nothing
you can do about it.

294
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,333
Look Vidrohi, you're my friend.

295
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,375
So, sticking to the
protocol of friendship...

296
00:20:24,376 --> 00:20:25,500
...I am asking you for permission.

297
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,000
One more thing, boy.

298
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:31,041
Never cross paths of a rejected lover.

299
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:34,416
Or else, you'll never
find true love, get it?

300
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,750
Bro, What if mother see this photo...
- Now pose...

301
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:44,625
Go on...

302
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,333
Ready
- Wide smile.

303
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,541
Smile.

304
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,583
'After this, in his own printing
press he secretly published...

305
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:01,208
'Bareilly Ki Barfi.'

306
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,125
Pritam Vidrohi ...Down-Down!

307
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:09,625
Then Pritam Vidrohi got the
beating of his life. - Mother...

308
00:21:09,626 --> 00:21:12,583
...from the women.
- Mother...

309
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,416
But only in a break.

310
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,875
Pritam Vidrohi ...Down-Down!
- Mother...

311
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:24,458
And before his scary dream
could come true...

312
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,625
Pritam Vidrohi packed
a photo of his mom...

313
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:29,666
...and fled from the
city fearing humiliation.'

314
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,500
'But...there was no need for that.'

315
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,375
'Not a single copy of
Bareilly Ki Barfi was sold.'

316
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:38,458
'The only place they were
in demand was the old paper-mart.'

317
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:48,500
'No one read it...
but definitely ate in it.'

318
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,750
'For the love of his friendship...'

319
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,708
'...Munna kept 10 copies
in his stall,...

320
00:21:57,959 --> 00:21:59,916
...with due prominence.'

321
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:03,208
'The first was
copy sold in five years...'

322
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,833
'...which Bitti bought few days ago.'

323
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,750
Who is this Pritam Vidrohi?

324
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,916
Even Google can't find him.

325
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:11,500
Is that him?

326
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,333
That's Pritam-the music director.

327
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,625
Why are you so crazy after him?

328
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:20,625
Why shouldn't I be?
He has changed my life.

329
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,375
The only detail about
him is that he's from Bareilly.

330
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,291
But, I’ve never heard about him.

331
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,291
Look at his face...

332
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,416
...feels like he's
smiling under duress.

333
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:43,916
That's the shop.

334
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,375
Brother
- Yes.

335
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,416
I bought this book from here.

336
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,833
Books once sold will
not be taken back.

337
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,083
No...not...never...

338
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:52,916
I wouldn't sell it for a million.

339
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:55,291
Huh! Did you like it so much?
- Listen...

340
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,416
This guy, Pritam Vidrohi...
the author.

341
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,625
Where can I find him?

342
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,708
Why?
- Why do you care?

343
00:23:01,876 --> 00:23:04,583
Meaning?
- Just answer my question.

344
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,458
Where can I find him?

345
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,708
Lt says here that
he lives in Bareilly.

346
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:11,208
He used to...
But no one knows where he is now!

347
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:16,916
You wouldn't know.

348
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:21,875
Lets go.

349
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,333
And what if I find him?

350
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,375
Then you will need to find me!
Take down my address.

351
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:31,500
She wanted to know
who's the writer.

352
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,916
I see...

353
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,750
Brother, you've spent
many years in exile.

354
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:38,000
It's time to gear
up for second innings.

355
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,583
Leave it...

356
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,458
l would not leave if someone
had shown so much interest in me.

357
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,541
I know.

358
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:47,875
I know too! Her address!

359
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,583
This is your matter, brother.
You go.

360
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:01,208
Why am l going?

361
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:04,125
There's no reason for me to go.
I won't go.

362
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:05,291
No...not...never...

363
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,833
Yes...
- I’m from Government Census counting.

364
00:24:22,584 --> 00:24:23,500
Count yourself.

365
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:24,916
Number of people in the family.

366
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,291
See for yourself.

367
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:34,500
You two...and...
- One daughter.

368
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,875
Only one?
- One's enough brother.

369
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:41,500
Is she married?
- Unfortunately not.

370
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:42,541
Why?

371
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:44,666
What do you mean?

372
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:46,916
I mean she will get married.
No doubt about it.

373
00:24:47,251 --> 00:24:48,416
And whenever she does...

374
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,833
...get the wedding cards printed
from my brother's press.

375
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,375
He's got a shop close by,
around the corner.

376
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,791
Good Luck Printing Press.

377
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,458
He also prints books.

378
00:24:57,792 --> 00:24:59,458
That's where Bareilly
Ki Barfi' was printed.

379
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,166
Are you married, son?

380
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,125
I am, aunty.
And soon I'll become a father.

381
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:06,458
Then, get lost.

382
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,125
Have you seen the
population of the country?

383
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:10,041
There is a lot of work.
Get going...Come on.

384
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:17,500
Well...I've set the stage,
and everything's in place...

385
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:19,375
...and dropped the bait as well.

386
00:25:21,459 --> 00:25:23,541
The rest lies in your hands.

387
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:25,625
Let's see if you can reel her in.

388
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:28,583
But be careful.

389
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:30,708
Because It's a mad family.

390
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:38,125
It's not 'Beds' its 'Weds'.

391
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:42,291
Dumb...

392
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,541
Yes...

393
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:46,708
Welcome to Good Luck Printing Press.

394
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:49,541
Lt is supremely famous for wedding
cards, birthday cards, visiting cards...

395
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:52,166
...funerals...venerations,
rites-rituals, etc etc.

396
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,041
And books also?

397
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:55,750
Where did you find this?

398
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:58,333
Where can I find him?

399
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,250
There's no way to find him.

400
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:03,458
You're few years too late, madam.
- He is no more?

401
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:06,041
Well, he is no more in this city.
- I see...

402
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:09,333
Well then, phone number, email,
address...anything is alright.

403
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,416
You won't get anything.
- Why not?

404
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,625
You see, ma'am, our company
follows a strict privacy policy.

405
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:15,000
Fans pester them a lot.

406
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,416
Sometimes they cut their nerve
or jump off the roof.

407
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,791
One of them even
swallowed rat poison.

408
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,416
These fans die, And then decent
people like us get stuck in between.

409
00:26:20,876 --> 00:26:22,166
By the way,
what is this so important matter?

410
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,750
It's personal.

411
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,208
Anyway, thank you.

412
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:27,625
Listen...

413
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:31,375
Since...your reason is so important,
I can make an effort...

414
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,791
...but, only if you tell
me what was is so urgent.

415
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:35,666
I...
- Brother card.

416
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:47,750
Your ice cream has melted completely.

417
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:49,541
Yes.

418
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:55,750
You mean to say you
are 'Bareilly Ki Barfi'.

419
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:57,458
Ditto.

420
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,125
How is that possible?

421
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:00,833
Exactly that's what
I want to find out.

422
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:05,875
Can you...

423
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,458
I can.

424
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,458
English fiIm.
- I do...

425
00:27:13,626 --> 00:27:14,750
Do you understand?

426
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:17,416
Of course, if you watch
you will understand too.

427
00:27:20,584 --> 00:27:22,791
This is why I want to meet Mr.
Vidrohi.

428
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:25,791
How does he know me so well?

429
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:29,208
How would l know?
- Yes, how will you know?

430
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:31,333
Exactly.

431
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:34,791
l can't give you his
phone number and address.

432
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:37,541
And he's not on Facebook,
email, etcetera.

433
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:39,791
You know what...

434
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,625
...write a letter to him.

435
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:45,333
I'll deliver it to him.

436
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,333
And what if he replies.

437
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,458
I'll deliver it to you.

438
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:55,083
That's right.

439
00:27:56,792 --> 00:27:57,625
Add it on my tab.

440
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:58,625
Okay brother.

441
00:28:06,709 --> 00:28:08,750
Bitti is Bareilly Ki Barfi.

442
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,750
That's what she claims.

443
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:15,583
Oh God! Hats off to You...
What did you do?

444
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:18,708
One mango with two seeds.
One Bitti and the other Babli.

445
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,916
Does she know you're the author?

446
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,125
Are you going to tell her?

447
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:30,541
First let me find out whether
she's telling the truth.

448
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,125
What if it's true?

449
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,875
I'll give it a try.

450
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,416
And, what if she's lying?

451
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:44,333
Well then, l am already in exile.
- True.

452
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,000
See...

453
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:48,041
If he was on Facebook
we could've have messaged him.

454
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,416
How about this one?

455
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:55,291
This one.

456
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,666
No...
I look too healthy in this one.

457
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,416
Why are you sending
your photo along

458
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:02,750
Just send the letter.

459
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,291
Well... Romeo should know
how his Juliet looks like.

460
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:13,708
How about this?
My stomach's also visible in this one.

461
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,416
Nice!!

462
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:21,375
Brother, even her stomach's
visible in this one.

463
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,083
She's advanced like
sister-in-law Babli.

464
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:29,958
What has she written in the letter?

465
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:34,583
"Dear Pritam..."

466
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:38,500
"Everyone only sees
the fault side of me."

467
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:42,166
"But, in the same faults
you saw my positives."

468
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,625
"l am really happy to know this."

469
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:46,333
"Even more happier that now
somewhere in this world there's...

470
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,708
...someone who understands me
and likes me for the way I am."

471
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:50,708
"lf you ever come to Bareilly..."

472
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,208
"...then do meet me."

473
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,583
"The sweets from our
shop are also as sweet."

474
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,958
"Your Babli... Bitti."

475
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:05,208
Bro...she's become emotional!

476
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,583
You've become emotional too!

477
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:20,833
'Chirag's pen was no
longer filled with tears...'

478
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,250
'...but joy instead.'

479
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:25,125
'Babli was history...'

480
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:27,000
'...and a new story awaited him.'

481
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,291
Brother Chirag.

482
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,833
Tillu...make one for
brother Chirag as well.

483
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,250
Why did you ask me to stop?
I am in a hurry!

484
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,291
But what's the hurry?
- Need to give her the letter.

485
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:40,500
Ohh...

486
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,291
She wrote to you yesterday and
you're sending her a reply today.

487
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,750
So? - Even the internet
in Bareilly isn't this fast.

488
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,208
You must wait for few days
before sending her a reply.

489
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:49,541
Or else you will get caught!

490
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:50,875
I see.

491
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:57,750
Did he reply?

492
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,500
He will.

493
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:11,833
Did he reply?

494
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,041
He will.

495
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,500
Yes...
- Hello, uncle.

496
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:28,875
Hello. Hello.

497
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:30,458
How can I help you?

498
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:31,916
Uncle, I own a press.

499
00:31:32,376 --> 00:31:34,875
Congratulations.
I have a confectionary shop.

500
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:37,958
By the way, how much do you
charge for pressing a single shirt.

501
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,916
No, uncle, I own a press... 'press'.

502
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:41,666
What can I do, son?

503
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,208
Papa, he's Mr. Chirag.
From Good Luck Printing Press.

504
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,375
Hello.
- l see... l see...

505
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,791
Hello. You did tell me about him.
- Sit down.

506
00:31:50,084 --> 00:31:50,875
Yes.

507
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:53,250
So what brings you here?

508
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:56,000
Well, our shop will
soon be completing 50 years.

509
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,333
So, is he buying our shop?

510
00:31:57,584 --> 00:32:00,000
No... if we print some
golden jubilee pamphlets...

511
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,833
...we will get some publicity.
Hello. - Hello.

512
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:03,791
And uncle, I'll print
1000 pamphlets for only 500.

513
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,416
In golden ink... no extra charge.

514
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,333
Very good.
- What's your name, son?

515
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:09,583
Chirag Dubey.

516
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:10,916
Are you married?

517
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:14,166
No, aunty. I am still single.
- How about some juice?

518
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:15,541
Let it be, no need...

519
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:17,166
I can't let you leave just like that.

520
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:18,875
Forget her.

521
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,916
Print 1200 for 400 rupees.

522
00:32:21,584 --> 00:32:23,250
We're like family...
it will be done.

523
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:26,041
I'll 'WhatsApp' you
when the job's done.

524
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:26,875
Just keep your 3g on.

525
00:32:26,876 --> 00:32:29,916
Sushila, give him my phone number.
l don't remember it.

526
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:31,541
How can I know your number?

527
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,291
I don't call you myself,
how can I remember.

528
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:35,500
Write down mine.
- Yes.

529
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:38,041
Why? He will give you a missed call
- Papa, I'll give him my number.

530
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,375
Take down my number.

531
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,583
Why don't you feed it yourself.

532
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,000
Okay
- Son, juice.

533
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,041
Thank you.

534
00:32:46,917 --> 00:32:48,458
Oh, benevolent Lord.

535
00:32:49,917 --> 00:32:50,833
Great.

536
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:53,916
See you, uncle.

537
00:33:18,459 --> 00:33:24,000
"Stay with me...
like the hum on my lips..."

538
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:29,791
"...and I'll stay with
you like your dreams."

539
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:35,833
"Dwell in my soul...like love..."

540
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:41,916
"...l run in the direction...
the trumpets blare."

541
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:11,500
"Hold my hands...
sweetheart, l promise."

542
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:17,333
"Now you're my desire, my intent."

543
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:22,833
"Say my name, beloved...
l am your world."

544
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:28,833
"The rains follow
you wherever you go."

545
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,333
"The rains follow..."

546
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:37,458
"Stay in my breath...
like the sweet fragrance."

547
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:43,166
"And...I'll pray for your grace."

548
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:49,291
"Dwell in my soul...like love..."
- Sometime talk to us also.

549
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:55,166
"...l run in the direction...
the trumpets blare."

550
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:15,250
"Your love-letter...is still
stored in my heart, sweetheart."

551
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:17,958
"Your love-letter sweetheart."

552
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:23,875
"...l wonder what lies in my fate."

553
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:26,916
She's exactly like
sister-in-law Babli.

554
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:33,958
95%
- "...I wonder what lies in my fate."

555
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:37,625
"Stay with me..."
- Except for the mole on her back.

556
00:35:40,792 --> 00:35:43,625
"...like the hum on my lips..."

557
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,666
I like you.

558
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,375
What did I do?

559
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:15,833
Actually, I've always come across
stubborn and chauvinistic type of boys.

560
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,041
God knows what they
think of themselves...

561
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:19,958
...and treat other women like dirt.

562
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:25,166
And me?

563
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:27,750
You...

564
00:36:30,584 --> 00:36:35,208
You're like a...Libran.

565
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:37,208
Libran.

566
00:36:37,751 --> 00:36:39,708
What a lucky guess.
- You are.

567
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:41,166
I am a Libran.

568
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,875
See.
- A pure Libra.

569
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:49,041
Librans always maintain a balance.

570
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,000
Like my father.

571
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:57,250
Always maintaining a
balance between me and my mother.

572
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:04,416
Then your birthday must be nearing!

573
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,333
It's closing in 23 minutes...

574
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:12,083
Today is your birthday!

575
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,250
Get up.

576
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,208
Where?
- Get up...I said get up.

577
00:37:18,417 --> 00:37:20,000
Let's go, I’ll tell you on the way.
- Why?

578
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:21,916
Come on...
- That's expensive stuff.

579
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:23,833
Here...here...

580
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:29,625
Lovely Sweets...
- Lovely sweets.

581
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,625
The 'y' fell off in the last monsoon.

582
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,291
Come on, we don't have much time.

583
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:36,416
How will you open the lock?
You don't have the key.

584
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,750
This is only to keep the thieves away.

585
00:37:39,376 --> 00:37:42,166
Are you crazy?
- Yeah...don't you know.

586
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:56,583
What are you doing?

587
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,208
Happy Birthday Mr. Chirag.

588
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:26,208
How is it?

589
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:30,375
Spicy.

590
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:39,875
"Stay with me...like the hum on my lips..."
- Now?

591
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:45,708
"...and I'll stay with
you like your dreams."

592
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:51,583
"Dwell in my soul...like love..."
- Bye.

593
00:38:51,876 --> 00:38:57,666
"...I run in the
direction...the trumpets blare."

594
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:02,208
Son...

595
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:16,416
He looks okay...got a long nose.

596
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,875
No moles on his face either.

597
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,208
But even moles can be cut
off with horse's hair.

598
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:26,875
He owns a printing press,
so must be earning well too.

599
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,625
Also, he has a motorcycle.

600
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:31,625
Let's assume that even if his
press shuts down, then...

601
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:34,375
We still have the confectionery shop.

602
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:37,083
The least he can do
is shoo away the flies.

603
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,916
Isn't it?

604
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:49,333
l know what Vidrohi
writes in his letters.

605
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:52,083
I see...
So tell me, James Bond.

606
00:39:53,126 --> 00:39:57,375
That you say such cute things.
You have a nice handwriting.

607
00:39:58,001 --> 00:39:59,125
And whenever he opens his letter...

608
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,041
...he can smell your faint fragrance.

609
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,625
That's nothing new.
The entire neighborhood can.

610
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:05,833
Guess what do I write in the letter?

611
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,791
You're dying to meet him, right?

612
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:17,791
What happened?

613
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,625
Tell me...

614
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,500
I've written to him thrice...

615
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:25,791
...that l want to meet him.

616
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,250
But he ignores my requests.

617
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,875
Maybe he doesn't want to meet you.

618
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:34,500
Fine, then...

619
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:37,583
...I'll stop writing to him.
- Maybe he does.

620
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:39,625
I don't know.

621
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:41,833
I want to meet him only once.

622
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:46,208
l have a right to meet the
man who knows so much about me.

623
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:47,583
Isn't it?

624
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:53,625
Only you know him...
please introduce us once.

625
00:40:55,251 --> 00:40:58,458
What if you don't like him?
- Doesn't matter.

626
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,875
And, what if you do?

627
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:06,291
If I do, then even my
mom and dad should like him.

628
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:10,375
If they do, Hi ...otherwise, bye.

629
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:14,583
Please help me meet him once ...
I'll do anything you say.

630
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,041
please...just once.

631
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,166
Just once.

632
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:23,416
Just once.

633
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,166
But, how will you make them meet?

634
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,291
Vidrohi ran away years ago.

635
00:41:31,626 --> 00:41:33,333
Who knows whether
he's still alive or dead?

636
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,583
Who's introducing her to Vidrohi?

637
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:37,291
Then?

638
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:42,625
Who's the real author of the book?
- You?

639
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,083
And who wrote the letter?
- You?

640
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,250
So who will go to meet her?

641
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:48,916
You!

642
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:52,458
Brother, hang it on this.

643
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:56,875
Take brother.

644
00:41:56,876 --> 00:41:58,041
Let's meet in the evening.

645
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,458
It's your turn today.

646
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:04,958
See, Bareilly Ki Barfi.

647
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:07,958
This book is messing her mind.

648
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:11,958
It says here if she smokes,
she's good.

649
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,208
If she watches English films, she's sweet.
- So what's wrong?

650
00:42:15,209 --> 00:42:17,416
Do you want to know what's wrong?
See...

651
00:42:17,417 --> 00:42:18,916
There's that boy, Chirag.

652
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,916
He's so well-mannered, talented.

653
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,208
And look at him...wretch.

654
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:23,666
Don't call him wretch.

655
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,333
Why not?

656
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:29,375
I would poison his juice.

657
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,500
Son, you?

658
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:33,916
I was passing by and
heading towards Ghanta Ghar...

659
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,666
...and thought I should
stop and pay you a visit.

660
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:38,083
I'll get some juice for you.
- No, no, aunty.

661
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,041
I guess you guys are busy
in some kind of family discussion.

662
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,958
I’ll leave.
Your Bareilly Ki Barfi.

663
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,833
Here.
- Groundnuts.

664
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:46,291
Thank you.
- Bless you.

665
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,125
On one side is the girl...

666
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:56,875
...who's head-over-heels
in love with the author.

667
00:42:58,084 --> 00:43:01,750
And on the other side is her mother,
who's willing to take his life.

668
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,916
So what are you planning to do now?

669
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,333
This is love, Munna...

670
00:43:08,626 --> 00:43:10,000
...it demands sacrifice.

671
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:16,708
Then chalk-out another
name in the name of love.

672
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:20,708
Don't you have any brains?

673
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:23,583
Why?
- Whose name is on the book?

674
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,083
Pritam Vidrohi.
- And the photo on the book?

675
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:27,708
Pritam Vidrohi.

676
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:30,416
So who will make the sacrifice?

677
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,208
Pritam Vidrohi.

678
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:38,458
Brother, your first love
made him flee from the city.

679
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:42,250
What if your second
love demands his life?

680
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:45,416
No-no...one should not
treat someone so badIy.

681
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,041
Forget it, let's do it.

682
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:57,708
It's going to be fun.

683
00:44:03,334 --> 00:44:04,791
But where is he these days?

684
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,958
Hello, son.

685
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:19,458
Sit down, it has been really long.
Sit, son.

686
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:20,833
Have some tea.

687
00:44:21,001 --> 00:44:23,208
Aunty, no need for these formalities.

688
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:25,291
So, what brings you here?

689
00:44:25,501 --> 00:44:26,625
What can I say, aunty?

690
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,500
I was going through my old album...

691
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:32,000
...and noticed
Vidrohi's innocent face.

692
00:44:32,667 --> 00:44:35,041
And then...I really
started missing him.

693
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,208
Where is he these days?

694
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:41,291
He's become a big man now.

695
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:43,208
Works at a really big company, as a...

696
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:46,208
What is it called? Sales Manager.

697
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:47,458
Get it?

698
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:49,458
Those guys who sell stuff.

699
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:51,458
That's what he does now.

700
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:57,208
Wait. Look..

701
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:59,083
He gave me this ATM card.

702
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,291
I can withdraw any amount I want.

703
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:03,750
But I don't need it.

704
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:06,541
See...last month he sent this TV.

705
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:09,416
It's too thin,
but the image's really clear.

706
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,166
And this fan too.

707
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,125
Even in a slow speed,
you feel cold in minutes.

708
00:45:14,126 --> 00:45:16,333
But where is he these days?

709
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,166
In Lucknow.

710
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:19,958
Patrakarpuram

711
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:21,833
Thank you.
- Have some cashews, son.

712
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:23,125
Take it.

713
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:25,791
Let's go, you glutton.
- l eat every day, son.

714
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:28,166
That's enough, son...

715
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:32,791
Thank you.

716
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:35,083
Why?

717
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:36,750
For every thing, you're doing.

718
00:45:40,459 --> 00:45:41,458
Why are you doing it?

719
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:50,708
Climb aboard, brother.
You've got our tickets.

720
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,166
Goodbye.

721
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:55,875
See you later.

722
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,250
See you later.
- Brother, the train's leaving.

723
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:00,791
Take care of yourself.

724
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:12,875
'Now, according to
Vidrohi's mother...

725
00:46:13,959 --> 00:46:15,500
'...he's this successful.'

726
00:46:15,501 --> 00:46:16,708
And that's not all, sir.

727
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:20,250
This 400 N/m beast comes
with six airbags, ABS...

728
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:22,333
...which is your Anti
Lock Braking system.

729
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:24,000
Fraction control...

730
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,375
Well, if you ask me
I think this is your car.

731
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:28,666
Good.

732
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,083
I think we'll take it.
- Okay.

733
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:33,416
Pack the blue one.

734
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,583
'But the reality is...'

735
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,958
Pack the blue one.

736
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:39,125
Show that one..
- Take a look, sister-in-law.

737
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,833
This comes with a blouse-piece
attached to it.

738
00:46:41,292 --> 00:46:43,125
There is two types of fading in this sari.
- Really.

739
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:44,416
Front and back.

740
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:46,041
See.

741
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:49,000
In fact, it's got extensive
intricate work done on the borders.

742
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,750
Sales Manager is selling saris.

743
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:52,375
Should I order tea or something else?
- No.

744
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,000
Do come again.
- Sure.

745
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:56,500
Congratulations for your wedding, brother.
- Come on.

746
00:47:01,417 --> 00:47:04,375
Brother, do you have anything in Chanderi?
- Yes, we...

747
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:07,041
Unbelievable, dude...

748
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:09,541
You're selling saris in an age where
you should be taking them off.

749
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:13,458
Brother, you...

750
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,583
What are you doing here?

751
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:19,500
Order some Cola...and
we'll talk in detail.

752
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:29,583
So you won't come along?

753
00:47:31,334 --> 00:47:32,500
No, brother.

754
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:37,916
Because of you...I lost my degree,
fled from my city.

755
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,666
I cannot afford to lose this job now.

756
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:45,125
Pritam, who's going
to look after the customers?

757
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:46,083
Get back inside.

758
00:47:49,376 --> 00:47:51,166
We have a huge variety in Chanderi.

759
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:54,000
Look at the borders,
it's got a beautiful border.

760
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:55,916
You can get these in different colors.

761
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,833
I’m telling you,
brother, I cannot do this.

762
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:03,375
Look, brother, I’ve found
true love almost a decade later.

763
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:06,125
But the girl loves the
author of 'Bareilly ki Barfi'...

764
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:08,041
...and according to the book,
that's you.

765
00:48:09,126 --> 00:48:10,250
That's really nice.

766
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,791
You created this problem,
now it's come back to haunt you.

767
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:15,416
Brother, you got to explain
him the way he understands best.

768
00:48:15,417 --> 00:48:16,625
Listen...

769
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:18,875
The girl wants to meet you once.

770
00:48:18,876 --> 00:48:20,333
Meet her. Break her heart.

771
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:21,333
I will make mine
Then get lost.

772
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,000
You find your way.
I'll find my way.

773
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,291
Yes...this is the border.
It's very nice.

774
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:30,708
Don't mind brother,
but can I say something...

775
00:48:31,626 --> 00:48:33,166
Everything that happened
with me in the last five years...

776
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,666
...did it make any difference to you?

777
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:37,625
So, now I don't care whether
your heart break or aches.

778
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,041
Look, bro...

779
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,583
lf l am heartbroken,
then so will be your mother.

780
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:45,208
Why mother?

781
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:48,416
When your mother finds out
that his dear, beloved, son is a liar.

782
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:52,250
And sells saris to women,
by draping them on his body.

783
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:53,750
She will be heartbroken.

784
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,666
Right, Munna?
- Yes, brother.

785
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:57,625
She won't stop wailing.

786
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:04,166
This isn't right...it's blackmail.

787
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:07,666
Correct answer. And, you win a
gift voucher from your own shop.

788
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:11,125
Brother!

789
00:49:11,417 --> 00:49:13,333
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

790
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:17,416
"The kid has turned stylish
and will now be menacing."

791
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,583
"With time his coolness
keeps oh so increasing."

792
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:25,166
"Coolness keeps oh so increasing."

793
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:29,291
Bitti hates chauvinists
men and bullies

794
00:49:29,917 --> 00:49:32,375
She's right...
they are worth being hated.

795
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:35,250
Always bullying people around.

796
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:38,333
You must become like them.

797
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,833
What?
- "The kid has turned stylish..."

798
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,666
Brother, this is one's too tight.
- "...and will now be menacing."

799
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:46,375
"With time his coolness
keeps oh so increasing."

800
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:49,041
"The simple guy's
good time sure has come."

801
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:50,583
"His super smart ways will now..."
- Yes Bro..

802
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,166
"...get the whole world watching."
- Hey Bro...

803
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:53,875
I can't do that.

804
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,458
He cannot do it, brother.
Listen to me...

805
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,291
I am right here to teach you.

806
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:00,083
Yes, but...

807
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,500
You know what,
just take me the way l am.

808
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:09,416
No one likes me anyway,
except for my mother.

809
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:10,916
She won't either.

810
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:12,500
Let's do that.

811
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,416
We can't take a chance now.

812
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,250
"With style more than
he himself could handle."

813
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:17,791
Keep this.
- lt's for me, brother.

814
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:19,375
Lets go.

815
00:50:19,709 --> 00:50:22,250
Give it here... Leave.
- Bro, gave it to me.

816
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:23,541
Should it take the call.

817
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:27,041
Yes, brother Chirag.

818
00:50:27,334 --> 00:50:29,583
Curb your emotions.

819
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:31,916
Say it with attitude.

820
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:35,125
Who is this speaking?

821
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:36,833
I’ll throw this sweet
corn soup on your head.

822
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,333
'Who is speaking?'

823
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:42,833
You call me.

824
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,541
My prepaid balance is low.

825
00:50:52,376 --> 00:50:53,166
Brother...

826
00:50:56,084 --> 00:50:57,375
Take your time.

827
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:01,083
Hello...

828
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:04,625
Go on...

829
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:07,958
"His attitude has no boundaries,
no barriers."

830
00:51:07,959 --> 00:51:12,000
"Everyone better get in his good
books before he gets even bigger."

831
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:13,375
Hello...

832
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:16,250
Y... Go on...

833
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:19,708
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

834
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,625
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

835
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,750
"I'm not the swag...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

836
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:29,125
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

837
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:34,166
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

838
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:37,333
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

839
00:51:38,084 --> 00:51:40,375
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

840
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:42,875
Don't try to act too smart.

841
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,000
Otherwise....

842
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:51,125
Let's imagine someone's
calling you from the back.

843
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:53,541
How will you look?

844
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:57,125
You mean, with attitude.
- Yes.

845
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:00,958
Call me once.

846
00:52:01,209 --> 00:52:02,583
Munna.

847
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:05,375
Vidrohi.

848
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,291
Vidrohi.

849
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:12,375
Vidrohi!

850
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:14,666
Bullies never look back.

851
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:17,750
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

852
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:20,958
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

853
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:24,083
"I'm not the swag...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

854
00:52:24,084 --> 00:52:27,416
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

855
00:52:27,626 --> 00:52:29,833
So time for your final test.

856
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:33,416
What are you saying?
This is Lucknow.

857
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:34,916
People shoot at first
sight and think later.

858
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:37,250
And l don't like sour betel-leaf.

859
00:52:37,459 --> 00:52:38,791
But you must today.

860
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,125
I'll get one for you.

861
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:41,583
What do you think,
we're on a morning walk?

862
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:44,333
Get on your bike.

863
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:49,333
Take a long run-up...
and speed away like a bullet.

864
00:52:49,501 --> 00:52:50,458
Come on.

865
00:52:53,709 --> 00:52:55,125
Lift the stand.

866
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:03,083
What do you think? Can he do it?

867
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,291
Here.

868
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,333
Hey bro, why are you parking
in the middle of the road?

869
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:29,958
Who the hell is he?
- Move your bike.

870
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:33,375
Move it...are you deaf?

871
00:53:33,542 --> 00:53:36,333
One sweet betel leaf.
- Listen.

872
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:39,000
Move your bike. What a strange guy.

873
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:40,958
Parked his bike in the middle.
- Hey Hero...

874
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:42,125
Hey man... you

875
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:43,416
How much?

876
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:44,625
10 Rs

877
00:53:44,834 --> 00:53:47,125
Move your bike,
- We can't move our car.

878
00:53:47,709 --> 00:53:49,250
Come on.

879
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:51,708
Move your bike.

880
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:55,000
Get lost with your bike.

881
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:57,125
Do you think you own the road?

882
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:58,375
Move your bike.

883
00:53:59,959 --> 00:54:02,458
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

884
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:06,000
"Coz I'm a bad...
bad Bada** babua (Boy)."

885
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:09,166
"The kid has turned stylish
and will now be menacing."

886
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:12,208
"With time his coolness
keeps oh so increasing."

887
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:15,208
"The simple guy's good
time sure has come ."

888
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:18,541
"His super smart ways will
now get the whole world watching ."

889
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:22,166
There's a power cut
in the entire city...

890
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,125
...but it will be
restored soon enough.

891
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:24,625
We regret the inconvenience caused.

892
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:26,250
It's me.

893
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:29,250
Is your phone in the
Lost and found department

894
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:30,541
No.

895
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,875
Oh! The battery's dead.

896
00:54:34,626 --> 00:54:36,541
Well, let me recharge you.

897
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:37,916
Hold my hand.

898
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:39,750
I've found Vidrohi?

899
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:41,958
Are you serious?

900
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:45,458
How is he?
- See for yourself.

901
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:46,500
Lets go.

902
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:48,500
I'm bringing him along.

903
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:52,250
Great...see you tomorrow.

904
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:56,541
Gopal, get me some tea.

905
00:54:57,792 --> 00:55:02,458
'One is not a schemer
and other is not a bully.'

906
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:04,750
'But...strange are the ways of love.'

907
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:06,750
'One's hatching schemes...

908
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:08,541
...and, the other is
emerging with an attitude.'

909
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,708
Yellow suits you.

910
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:12,750
This one?
- No.

911
00:55:13,584 --> 00:55:17,541
You're acting more
snooty than a heroine.

912
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,333
The one you're wearing also looks nice.
- Be quiet.

913
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:22,041
This?
- Blue buttons don't suit you.

914
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,000
It's from your shop.
- Boutique.

915
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:25,041
Right...boutique.

916
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:27,250
Your phone's ringing.

917
00:55:27,917 --> 00:55:28,875
Hello Madam,

918
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:30,916
You haven't left yet?

919
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:31,958
I'm just leaving.

920
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:33,416
You're really unbelievable.

921
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,291
You took four days to find Mr.
Vidrohi.

922
00:55:35,501 --> 00:55:37,708
I can at least take
2 hours to get ready right!

923
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:39,333
Let him wait, I am coming.

924
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,291
Okay.

925
00:55:41,584 --> 00:55:42,875
She’ll be here any minute.

926
00:55:44,876 --> 00:55:48,083
I'll be fine...but, isn't this too much?
- No.

927
00:55:48,376 --> 00:55:49,916
Just remember what l said.

928
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:53,250
And, brother...my voice...

929
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:55,208
From the stomach...

930
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:57,333
Like Mr. Bachchan.
- Hello.

931
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:00,208
Hello.

932
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:02,083
Name...what was her name?

933
00:56:02,334 --> 00:56:04,375
Bitti.
- Bitti...

934
00:56:04,584 --> 00:56:06,750
Dimwit...don't foil the plan.

935
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:09,125
I will try my best.

936
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:13,166
This is it.
We've arrived.

937
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:17,041
She's here.

938
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:21,583
Hi.

939
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:23,083
Hello.

940
00:56:23,251 --> 00:56:24,958
It's me...

941
00:56:25,542 --> 00:56:27,458
Now just repeat after me.

942
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,083
What can I do?

943
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:31,416
Tell him it's Vidrohi's work.

944
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,750
Who? Vidrohi!

945
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:36,041
If he still doesn't listen,
give him one tight slap.

946
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:39,750
And don't call me again
for such trivial matters.

947
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,500
Hang up...

948
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,875
So...what was your name?
Guddi?

949
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,791
Which one is Guddi?
- It's Bitti. I'm Bitti.

950
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:51,625
Bitti...right.

951
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:55,291
Rama. Best friend.
- Best?

952
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:56,958
Wait a minute,
how could you not recognize me.

953
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,541
I sent you my photo.
- Photo.

954
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,541
Yeah, I sent my photo
along with the letter.

955
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:02,791
Letter?

956
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,166
The one in the sari.
- Sari?

957
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:09,375
Yes...
- Right, your photo...

958
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:12,833
Say something.
- So many people send their pictures.

959
00:57:13,501 --> 00:57:15,375
He's a public figure.
- Yeah.

960
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:19,333
Hey..

961
00:57:19,501 --> 00:57:21,250
Son, come here.

962
00:57:23,751 --> 00:57:24,625
Yes, sir.

963
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:25,833
What will you have?

964
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:27,416
What, sir?

965
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:30,125
Who's going to ask
what we'll have, huh?

966
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,041
Sorry, sir.
What will you have?

967
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:33,916
Chow-mien for everyone.

968
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,166
Okay, sir.
- No, we're leaving.

969
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:38,083
Okay.
- But, you just got here.

970
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:41,291
We need to take Rama's
brother to the doctor.

971
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,458
We do, don't we?

972
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:46,375
Yes.
- So get up.

973
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:46,750
Lets go.

974
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:48,625
Invite him for lunch tomorrow.
- Why?

975
00:57:48,959 --> 00:57:49,583
It's a Sunday.

976
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:51,500
You can introduce Mr.
Vidrohi to your parents.

977
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:56,583
lt's a Sunday.
Fine, I'll meet her parents.

978
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:57,750
Okay, Bye...

979
00:57:58,251 --> 00:58:00,500
By the way, you write really nicely.

980
00:58:00,751 --> 00:58:02,208
You look really nice.

981
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:03,541
Thank you.
- Lets go.

982
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:10,416
Okay...
- You were amazing.

983
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:12,625
And the waiter...
- They are coming back.

984
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:15,583
Fine, then get going.

985
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:17,625
What's wrong?
Don't feel like leaving?

986
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:18,958
Sit down and eat.

987
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:21,083
No, Thank-you, I had left my purse.
- Okay.

988
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:22,750
Wait...wait...

989
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:25,083
I'll see you out.
- No...

990
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,541
Come on.
- Let him go along.

991
00:58:26,542 --> 00:58:28,500
Let's go.
- Okay, bye.

992
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:37,250
So arrogant.

993
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:39,375
I wanted to slap him.

994
00:58:39,751 --> 00:58:41,416
"Which one is Guddi?"

995
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,083
Who does he think he is,
Guddi's uncle.

996
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:44,916
He wasn't that bad though...

997
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:47,708
Every successful
man is a bit arrogant.

998
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:49,458
Tell me...

999
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:51,625
Have you ever heard a beggar say...

1000
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:56,125
"Spare me some change...
or get lost."

1001
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:57,166
Have you?

1002
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:59,083
Wise guy's has even self invited
home tomorrow.

1003
00:59:00,542 --> 00:59:03,083
Listen, l am coming too.

1004
00:59:04,084 --> 00:59:06,000
You're having this special interest?

1005
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,291
I like him.

1006
00:59:09,126 --> 00:59:10,250
I am warning you...

1007
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:13,416
If he tries to act smart tomorrow...
- Then you can slap him.

1008
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:15,375
Let him come home first.

1009
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:17,416
What do you think?

1010
00:59:18,084 --> 00:59:18,833
We'll see...

1011
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:26,583
Brother, when sister-in-law
is over Vidrohi...

1012
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:28,708
...then why give her another dose.

1013
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,083
Every antibiotic needs
to be taken for three days.

1014
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:34,500
The effect is never
seen in the first dose.

1015
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:37,041
If you don't complete the course...

1016
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:39,625
...then, there's a chance
of the sickness coming back.

1017
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:44,375
You mean...the next
two doses are her parents.

1018
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,958
Why did you get this sari?

1019
00:59:50,667 --> 00:59:53,000
My mother always says never
go to any house without a gift.

1020
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:54,833
You're not going there as a suitor.

1021
00:59:55,542 --> 00:59:57,000
Fine, then you can give her this.

1022
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:58,708
You bought it, so you give it.

1023
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,083
In fact, you can drape
it on yourself as well.

1024
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,625
"See sister-in-law...it's got
three different kinds of shades."

1025
01:00:02,626 --> 01:00:04,708
"Front and back..."

1026
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,708
Fine, pack it.

1027
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:11,166
And no need to make a feast.

1028
01:00:11,459 --> 01:00:12,791
He's not coming over
to ask for marriage.

1029
01:00:13,334 --> 01:00:17,333
Dear daughter! I am not so lucky, that a
guy will meet and ask you for marriage.

1030
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:18,583
Don't keep your hopes high.

1031
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:21,541
I am going to stay right here, dancing
on your head for the rest of your life.

1032
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:24,291
Go take a look, must be Chirag.

1033
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:28,750
I'll go answer the door.
- I’m going to call Rama.

1034
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:35,750
Hello uncle.
- Bless you, son. And, who are you?

1035
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:37,500
Come in, uncle.
This is your home only, isn't it?

1036
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:39,500
Come in...don't be shy.

1037
01:00:39,834 --> 01:00:42,000
Why would I be shy?
- Hello, uncle.

1038
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:43,750
First, you touched my feet
and now you're greeting me again?

1039
01:00:43,751 --> 01:00:45,375
That's me.
- It's him.

1040
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:46,750
Hello, aunty.
- Hello, son.

1041
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,666
Chirag, who is he?
- He's my friend.

1042
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:49,875
Papa, that's Mr. Vidrohi.

1043
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:51,916
Remember I told you about
him yesterday.

1044
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,875
So he's this guy who
wrote that absurd book.

1045
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:56,500
I'm sure you liked it.

1046
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:58,916
Happy birthday, Whenever it is!

1047
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:01,416
Chanderi.

1048
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:03,416
What would you like to have, son?

1049
01:01:03,584 --> 01:01:07,416
Buttermilk, juice, tea, coffee.
- I'll have tea, aunty, Hot.

1050
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:09,541
And you'll have juice only!
- Yes.

1051
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:16,041
Vidrohi, do you write to make
a living, or is it just a hobby.

1052
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:20,041
With the grace of Goddess,
I've enough money...

1053
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,958
...to buy your shop
and gift it back to you.

1054
01:01:23,209 --> 01:01:27,083
Me?
- Writing is just a hobby.

1055
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,708
What's wrong with your neck?

1056
01:01:30,209 --> 01:01:31,791
This body has grown old son...

1057
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:35,041
It always needs some repair or other.

1058
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,708
Just last week he
was cured of his piles.

1059
01:01:38,334 --> 01:01:39,125
It's nothing serious, uncle.

1060
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:41,166
Add some basil seeds in
water and drink it at night.

1061
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:43,708
It will fix your all your problems.
- Those things don't work.

1062
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,791
Allow me.
- No...no...

1063
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:46,875
Don't do Vidrohi.

1064
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:48,875
Let me...
- Let it be.

1065
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,000
Don't break his neck instead.

1066
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:54,250
Leave me.
- What are you doing?

1067
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:56,250
Quiet!

1068
01:01:59,042 --> 01:01:59,791
Hold this.

1069
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:01,291
Hail Bajrang Bali!

1070
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:03,125
Be gentle, son.

1071
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:05,375
One..

1072
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,666
Two... three... done.

1073
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:09,791
Papa, are you alright?

1074
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,291
Bitti, Shall l turn?

1075
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:12,708
Yes turn.
- Careful.

1076
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:21,041
Wow! l can see everything
from the loo to Sushila.

1077
01:02:21,042 --> 01:02:23,291
Bitti, I can even
see the pots behind me.

1078
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:24,458
Wow.

1079
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:28,416
Since when did you start doing this?
- Just now.

1080
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:30,083
Your father's my first customer.

1081
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:31,625
Hello...call now.
- Bitti....

1082
01:02:31,834 --> 01:02:33,291
...give him 10-20 rupees
as a token of appreciation.

1083
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:35,791
Give him money.
- Uncle, I have a lot of money.

1084
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:39,333
Are you married, son?
- No, aunty.

1085
01:02:39,709 --> 01:02:41,000
I knew it.

1086
01:02:41,751 --> 01:02:42,583
Answer the phone.

1087
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:45,083
Phone ringing
( ring tone 'hey listen')

1088
01:02:45,084 --> 01:02:46,083
Hold on.

1089
01:02:47,959 --> 01:02:48,875
Hello.

1090
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:50,833
Listen....
- You listen up.

1091
01:02:51,626 --> 01:02:53,291
Next time if you call me...

1092
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:56,458
...I'll kick you so hard,
you'll get a dimple on your a**

1093
01:02:57,751 --> 01:02:58,875
Hang on now.

1094
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:00,250
Hot...

1095
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:02,375
The tea is hot, son.

1096
01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:05,291
We'll be leaving, aunty.
- Okay, son. You can leave.

1097
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:08,916
But you stay, son. I won't let
you go without having lunch.

1098
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,500
I really like you, son.
- Okay.

1099
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:13,500
Eat.

1100
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:15,916
They are very famous, taste it.
- I know.

1101
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:19,583
'In a brief moment...'

1102
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:25,166
'...he turned papa's neck straight,
and turned the game around.'

1103
01:03:27,459 --> 01:03:30,083
I told you...send him back.

1104
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:32,625
But you wanted to complete the course.

1105
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:33,958
Now it's an overdose.

1106
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:35,791
That was too much man!

1107
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:38,791
Were you trying to be a hero?

1108
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:44,375
I did exactly like you taught me.

1109
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:46,000
And, what were you
saying on the phone?

1110
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:49,041
You'll make a dimple on my a**
- No, I...

1111
01:03:49,209 --> 01:03:52,791
I was only sticking to my character.

1112
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:57,041
My performance will go weak
if you keep changing the script.

1113
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,500
Why did you have to
fix her father's neck?

1114
01:04:01,709 --> 01:04:03,416
An old man was in pain...

1115
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:06,083
...so I thought I should fix his neck.

1116
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:09,041
He is your father-in-law after all.

1117
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:11,333
I was just helping you out.
- Mr. Helping hand...

1118
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,500
You were supposed to depress her,
but you've impressed her instead.

1119
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:18,333
Fine, I'll go back then.

1120
01:04:18,334 --> 01:04:20,333
Right, go on...
- You cannot leave like this.

1121
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:23,083
You must first clean
up the mess you have made.

1122
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:35,416
This new hairstyle really suits you.

1123
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:36,791
Have another one.
- No...

1124
01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:38,291
Take it.
- l don't want it.

1125
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,458
I've been eating since morning.

1126
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:43,625
You must eat properly.

1127
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:46,791
You've become so scrawny.

1128
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:51,208
Will a wedding dress
look nice on this body?

1129
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:58,333
All the faults are with me, right mom?

1130
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:03,375
You can wear my wedding dress.

1131
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:09,791
Uncle.
- Yes dear.

1132
01:05:15,959 --> 01:05:17,166
Mr. Vidrohi.

1133
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:23,666
Bitti...at this hour?

1134
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:26,958
Yeah... If papa doesn't eat a sweet
betel-leaf after dinner he gets bitter.

1135
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:28,083
What are you doing here?

1136
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:30,291
Well...l have a similar habit.

1137
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:33,083
If I don't eat a dessert
after dinner I get bitter too.

1138
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:34,625
I see...

1139
01:05:35,084 --> 01:05:36,791
You should eat more sweets...

1140
01:05:37,209 --> 01:05:38,708
It will cure your bitterness.

1141
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:42,291
Am I that bitter?
- No...

1142
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:45,333
...but, you're not like
I thought you would me.

1143
01:05:45,334 --> 01:05:46,666
I mean, Rama and me.

1144
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:51,791
What did you and ... Rama think?

1145
01:05:52,459 --> 01:05:56,333
You see...your letters were filled
with the fragrance of romance.

1146
01:05:57,126 --> 01:05:58,791
But you turned out to
be the fragrance of bullies

1147
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:00,375
So I...

1148
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:02,875
Don't get me wrong.

1149
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,875
You're not that bad person.

1150
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:14,541
It's the conditions
That make people bad.

1151
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,625
You are right.

1152
01:06:18,376 --> 01:06:20,625
It's the conditions and
people who made me bitter.

1153
01:06:22,292 --> 01:06:24,791
But even bitter people have a...

1154
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:25,833
Huh?

1155
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:30,083
Heart...and it's not bitter at all.

1156
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:32,458
Bitti...

1157
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,208
Vidrohi, Are you okay.

1158
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:44,000
Sweetmeat...

1159
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,500
Make that two.

1160
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:55,166
You didn't tell me...
did you like Vidrohi?

1161
01:06:55,334 --> 01:06:56,250
You never asked.

1162
01:06:56,251 --> 01:06:59,416
From the time he is here
you don't even miss me.

1163
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:03,958
You could've at least called.
- You could've too.

1164
01:07:04,709 --> 01:07:06,916
Yes, l could.
- So...

1165
01:07:07,959 --> 01:07:10,833
So tell me, how did you like Vidrohi?

1166
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:14,041
You know, when we met first...

1167
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:16,125
...I wanted to claw his face.
- I knew it.

1168
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,541
No...but, when he came home...

1169
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:20,500
...I realized, he's not that bad.

1170
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:22,833
And, mom and dad
are completely floored.

1171
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:25,125
I see...

1172
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,125
So, what's the plan?

1173
01:07:27,751 --> 01:07:28,708
What's the plan?

1174
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,041
We've just met twice.

1175
01:07:30,751 --> 01:07:32,250
We'll first get to know each other.

1176
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:34,708
Meet few more times.

1177
01:07:36,334 --> 01:07:38,291
You've met me many times.

1178
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,250
So?
- What do you think about me?

1179
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:42,875
What's to think?

1180
01:07:43,084 --> 01:07:45,041
That You're my very good friend.

1181
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:48,583
No one does what you did for me.

1182
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:53,000
She just friend-zoned me.
- They are here.

1183
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:56,625
You're here.

1184
01:07:56,626 --> 01:07:57,625
Brother...

1185
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:00,583
Vidrohi, Remember we
must close this chapter today.

1186
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:02,916
I've by-hearted everything,
brother, don't worry.

1187
01:08:03,626 --> 01:08:06,041
How are you?
- Great.

1188
01:08:06,251 --> 01:08:07,208
Hello.

1189
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:11,791
We're early.
- You're half an hour late.

1190
01:08:12,626 --> 01:08:14,750
This place is for boozing at night.

1191
01:08:14,751 --> 01:08:16,208
And you guys are eating groundnuts.

1192
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:17,791
Yeah, right.
Looking at the way you drink...

1193
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,541
...you would hardly have any
place in your stomach for groundnuts.

1194
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:21,708
You're absolutely right.

1195
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:25,250
This is exactly what I say
to myself every night when I drink.

1196
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:27,708
And forget in the morning.

1197
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:31,291
He's also got memory loss.
- Yeah...

1198
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:34,958
Oh yes...

1199
01:08:35,584 --> 01:08:37,791
And I've also been to jail
once because of this mix-up.

1200
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:38,791
I see...

1201
01:08:38,959 --> 01:08:42,500
Oh, God...jail...criminal...
this is really serious.

1202
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:43,833
It's nothing serious.

1203
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:46,083
Lord Krishna was also born in a jail.

1204
01:08:46,834 --> 01:08:48,958
And, one should not
remember everything.

1205
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:50,625
Wow...

1206
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:55,291
What if I forget you tomorrow?

1207
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:58,125
It's not that easy
to forget Bitti Mishra.

1208
01:08:58,459 --> 01:08:59,625
Let's make a bet.

1209
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,875
And you'll definitely not forget
me until tomorrow.

1210
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,416
What is there tomorrow?
- What?

1211
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:05,375
How can you forget?
You printed all those pamphlets.

1212
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:08,333
Golden Jubilee Celebrations
of Lovely Sweets.

1213
01:09:08,834 --> 01:09:12,458
How can you not come?
- He can't come.

1214
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:14,625
Why not?
- He's leaving for Lucknow tonight.

1215
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:16,791
Bagh Express... Northern Railway.

1216
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,125
Happy journey.
- But...

1217
01:09:19,876 --> 01:09:22,791
Going back... Yeah, I'm going back.

1218
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:26,541
How can he come?
He's leaving, he can't come.

1219
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:28,625
Hold this. Show me the ticket.

1220
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:32,333
I see...

1221
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:34,208
And, what if it gets torn?

1222
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:37,958
No, no, Bitti...

1223
01:09:38,209 --> 01:09:39,333
No, Bitti...

1224
01:09:39,334 --> 01:09:41,708
I swear I'll never talk to you again.
Return the ticket.

1225
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:43,833
Tell her.
- Yeah, l won't either.

1226
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:45,791
No chance.
- Fine, leave.

1227
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:47,791
Give me your phone.

1228
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:49,250
I'm low on balance.

1229
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:52,625
Delete my number, and l will too.

1230
01:09:53,084 --> 01:09:54,250
Because you're leaving.

1231
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:55,625
Go on...
- Great.

1232
01:09:55,834 --> 01:09:59,000
So Mr. Vidrohi,
you've to pack your bags...and

1233
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:00,791
Lets go
- Brother, keys.

1234
01:10:02,209 --> 01:10:05,125
Don't be sad, Bitti.
- Doesn't matter.

1235
01:10:05,126 --> 01:10:06,000
Please, leave.

1236
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,041
This is no time to get emotional,
Vidrohi.

1237
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:11,833
l had a hard time getting
this ticket...through VIP quota.

1238
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:13,166
With recommendations from Mr. Vishnoi.

1239
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,708
Let's go.
- Bitti...

1240
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:19,500
No...the trains are packed.

1241
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:26,125
'Vidrohi's revolt... Fantastic.'

1242
01:10:26,876 --> 01:10:28,250
I can't go back breaking your heart.

1243
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:32,250
'But soon he was hit...
l mean got ditched.'

1244
01:10:32,417 --> 01:10:35,166
You cannot leave Bitti.
- Listen to me.

1245
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:37,750
You tore up the ticket.

1246
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:39,625
I like Rama, Brother. If I die,
Bitti won't wait for 14 years.

1247
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:42,916
Just kill him.

1248
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:44,833
I like Rama.

1249
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:51,541
I like Rama.

1250
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:55,375
Bitti's my sister-in-law.

1251
01:10:57,417 --> 01:10:59,208
The question is whether
Rama likes you too.

1252
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:00,625
Don't know.

1253
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:03,583
But I tore up the ticket to find out.

1254
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,458
I'll stay here for another
week and test her.

1255
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:09,791
lf she's the one for me,
then we'll leave together.

1256
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:12,916
Sorry.
- Huh!

1257
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,416
Sorry.

1258
01:11:15,126 --> 01:11:17,458
There's water in this ear,
say it in this one.

1259
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:21,125
Sorry.
- Fritters...

1260
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:23,500
Yes 'Lorry'

1261
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:27,416
ok now you focus all
your attention on Rama.

1262
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:30,000
Okay.
I will support you in this love story.

1263
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:33,916
Buy a really nice gift for Rama.

1264
01:11:34,084 --> 01:11:36,291
There's no need for this.
- It's love after all.

1265
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,833
I've told you a thousand times...

1266
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:38,958
...don't bathe at night.

1267
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:40,708
See aunty,
He took a bath with his clothes on.

1268
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:56,166
"Abracadabra...
my beloved's so handsome."

1269
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:59,625
"Always dressed smartly,
whether it's Delhi or Agra."

1270
01:11:59,626 --> 01:12:03,166
"Your earrings make
my heart skip a beat."

1271
01:12:03,334 --> 01:12:07,125
"When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts."

1272
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:18,083
"Your earrings make
my heart skip a beat."

1273
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,750
"When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts."

1274
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:23,625
"Stop taunting me...

1275
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:25,333
Don't be a wise guy."

1276
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:27,125
"l am not Juliet,

1277
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:29,625
And you're not my Romeo."

1278
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:34,166
"O Sweety..."

1279
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:38,333
"O Sweety your drama,
creates a stir."

1280
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:41,916
"This is unfair."

1281
01:12:42,084 --> 01:12:45,750
"Believe it or not,
we're crazy about you..."

1282
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:49,250
"Listen O,
sweetheart, we're your beloved."

1283
01:12:49,251 --> 01:12:50,000
"DJ."

1284
01:12:52,459 --> 01:12:53,333
"Crazy"

1285
01:13:04,209 --> 01:13:06,041
"Don't make a commotion..."

1286
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:07,916
"...everyone's watching."

1287
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:11,625
"What do you get from making a scene."

1288
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:15,291
"Don't ignore me...
I am not useless."

1289
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:18,583
"Teach me the language of love."

1290
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,833
"Stop taunting me...

1291
01:13:20,834 --> 01:13:22,750
Don't be a wise guy."

1292
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:24,583
"l am not your Juliet,

1293
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:26,833
And you're not my Romeo."

1294
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:31,416
"O Sweety..."

1295
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:35,500
"O Sweety your drama, creates a stir."

1296
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:39,333
"This is unfair."

1297
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:43,000
"Believe it or not,
we're crazy about you..."

1298
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:46,791
"Listen o sweetheart,
we're your beloved."

1299
01:14:01,709 --> 01:14:05,375
"Abracadabra...my
beloved's so handsome."

1300
01:14:05,376 --> 01:14:08,958
"Always dressed smartly,
whether it's Delhi or Agra."

1301
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:09,958
Bravo, Mr. Mishra.

1302
01:14:10,876 --> 01:14:13,458
The 'Pukhraj-gem' has
started to show effect.

1303
01:14:14,459 --> 01:14:16,583
We were trying to
find one suitor for Bitti...

1304
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,458
...but, now we found two.

1305
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:21,125
Now, choose what you want.

1306
01:14:21,626 --> 01:14:25,416
And, it's not like we've
to choose between good or bad.

1307
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:30,625
One's good...and the
other's a slightly better.

1308
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:32,916
Both are well suited.

1309
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:36,791
That's the problem.
Who do we choose?

1310
01:14:37,292 --> 01:14:38,458
Right?

1311
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:47,708
'On one side, Mr. Vidrohi was
making his impression'

1312
01:14:48,042 --> 01:14:51,625
...while on the other Mr.
Chirag was breaking his head

1313
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:55,916
Hello, aunty.
- Hello-hello.

1314
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:02,458
Your spectacles were broken,
weren't they? I got it fixed.

1315
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:04,791
That's a big help, son.

1316
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:08,166
It's hard to read anything without it.

1317
01:15:09,126 --> 01:15:11,166
Everything's so clear now.

1318
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:17,541
Son, you care so much for everyone.

1319
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:21,708
Can I say something?
- Please do.

1320
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,916
I’ve been thinking about
something for the past few days.

1321
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:28,500
About Bitti's marriage.

1322
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:31,041
Oh, Aunty,
Bitti is a really nice girl.

1323
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:32,958
She will get married sooner or later,
don't worry.

1324
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:34,291
Yeah...

1325
01:15:34,709 --> 01:15:37,625
Actually, I already know
who's best groom for her.

1326
01:15:39,376 --> 01:15:41,125
I will convince Bitti...

1327
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:43,416
And you...
- What?

1328
01:15:43,959 --> 01:15:45,833
You convince Vidhrohi.

1329
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:55,125
Vidrohi...for Bitti?
- Yes.

1330
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:58,958
Did Bitti say that?
- She doesn't have to.

1331
01:15:59,251 --> 01:16:01,541
They look like a match made in heaven.

1332
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:03,875
You just be like God Hanuman

1333
01:16:03,876 --> 01:16:06,416
...and take this burden off my chest.

1334
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:09,333
'When a lover feels
the storm in the sea.

1335
01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:12,041
'...he finds different ways to
to save himself from loosing his Iove.

1336
01:16:12,042 --> 01:16:14,416
What happened?
- What can l say, aunty?

1337
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,416
Vidrohi is a divorcee.
- Huh?

1338
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:20,291
Hmm...

1339
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:27,375
Brother Chirag.
- This way, Vidrohi.

1340
01:16:27,959 --> 01:16:28,916
Brother...

1341
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:31,750
What's wrong?
Why did you call me suddenly?

1342
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:34,125
What's happening, isn't good for you.

1343
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:36,708
What happened now?

1344
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:40,833
That seed of love,
you sowed in Rama's heart...

1345
01:16:41,126 --> 01:16:42,666
...was reaped by someone else.

1346
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:44,500
What do you mean?
- It means...

1347
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:46,458
Someone came to see Rama yesterday.

1348
01:16:46,459 --> 01:16:48,291
And they really liked Rama a lot.

1349
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:49,625
Liked her?

1350
01:16:49,626 --> 01:16:50,708
Total.

1351
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:53,583
Did Rama say yes?

1352
01:16:54,334 --> 01:16:55,541
She didn't say no either.

1353
01:16:57,626 --> 01:17:00,583
Who...who is the guy?
Tell me his name.

1354
01:17:00,584 --> 01:17:02,416
There's nothing you can do.

1355
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:04,708
He's a goldsmith,
he's got a shop of his own.

1356
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:08,083
He can melt silver,
and make jewelry for Rama.

1357
01:17:08,251 --> 01:17:11,458
Even his security guard makes
more money than you.

1358
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:15,958
But...

1359
01:17:18,376 --> 01:17:20,375
I’ve seen love in
Rama's eyes for you.

1360
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:24,208
Yeah...so did l.
In fact, I've seen it more often.

1361
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:25,916
Honestly?

1362
01:17:28,417 --> 01:17:30,000
So, what should l do, brother?

1363
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:32,833
My advice is that you
should tell her tomorrow.

1364
01:17:33,292 --> 01:17:35,458
Tomorrow is also lucky Wednesday.
- Yes.

1365
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:39,958
I will if you say so.
- And, listen...

1366
01:17:40,376 --> 01:17:43,333
Say it in front of everyone.
- Why?

1367
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:46,833
Huh! You only kiss in private.

1368
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:50,500
...but in front of everyone
you openly express your love.

1369
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,500
You're right, brother. I will try.

1370
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,291
And, write down a few lines,
so you can propose to her.

1371
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:57,250
Have you heard
AItaf Raja's(Singer) songs?

1372
01:17:57,876 --> 01:17:59,750
You'll get lots of ideas from him.
- Okay.

1373
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:01,250
Okay, brother.

1374
01:18:07,001 --> 01:18:08,833
What do you think, brother?
Will Rama say a yes?

1375
01:18:09,001 --> 01:18:10,291
Who cares?

1376
01:18:11,709 --> 01:18:14,166
The neighbor's kid
has climbed up the tree.

1377
01:18:14,542 --> 01:18:16,250
If he hikes down safely,
we'll get to eat mangoes.

1378
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:18,791
And, if he falls down and dies,
we'll get to eat at his funeral.

1379
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:21,875
In this situation,
whether Rama says yes or no...

1380
01:18:21,876 --> 01:18:24,250
... Bitti is sure to get heartbroken.

1381
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:27,083
Can l say something, brother?

1382
01:18:27,376 --> 01:18:28,541
You're such a villain.

1383
01:18:35,876 --> 01:18:38,708
This lake is where love was born!

1384
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:41,125
The film was called 'Jawani Diwaani'.

1385
01:18:41,334 --> 01:18:44,708
Vinod Khanna and Dharmendra
waged a fierce war.

1386
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:46,666
And the reason was
Hema Malini, mister.

1387
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:48,708
Say it.
- "Dream Girl..."

1388
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:52,208
"The queen of my dreams...
Dream girl."

1389
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:56,000
Turn your head that side...and
enjoy the view from this side.

1390
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:57,833
Mister.
- Yes, mister.

1391
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,125
Can you stay quiet, mister?
- Why, mister?

1392
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:01,125
Would you like one, mister?

1393
01:19:01,126 --> 01:19:02,541
Why are you getting angry?

1394
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,041
It was so much fun.

1395
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:07,666
Turn your head that side...
and enjoy the view from this side.

1396
01:19:08,501 --> 01:19:11,083
Mr. Vidrohi wants to say something.
- Really...

1397
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:12,333
Speak up..

1398
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:16,250
Don't be shy.

1399
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:19,291
Oh no...I am not shy.

1400
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:23,875
"Your heart has stolen my heart."

1401
01:19:23,876 --> 01:19:26,208
"And stolen my peace and sleep."

1402
01:19:26,209 --> 01:19:28,083
"Don't make any excuses."

1403
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:29,625
"I've made up my mind
to make you my wife, Rama."

1404
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:30,541
"Will you marriage me?"

1405
01:19:31,459 --> 01:19:33,250
"Will you marry me?"
- "Will you marriage me?"

1406
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:51,125
Look...Vidrohi, you're a great guy.

1407
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:55,708
And l like you too.
- Thank you.

1408
01:19:56,417 --> 01:20:00,000
But, I cannot marry a divorcee.

1409
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:04,375
It's against our culture.
- You've great values.

1410
01:20:05,626 --> 01:20:07,083
Divorcee...

1411
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,708
Hold on...who's a divorcee?
- Me...

1412
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:16,958
Me?

1413
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:18,041
What are you saying?

1414
01:20:18,459 --> 01:20:20,041
I've never even been engaged.

1415
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:21,833
I mean, I've never even...

1416
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,416
You...

1417
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:25,833
Say something.
- What will he say?

1418
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:27,916
He's the one who told me.

1419
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,708
And that's Suicide Point...

1420
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:40,166
Every year 72 lovers
drown to death here.

1421
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,500
"Dreamgirl..."

1422
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:43,291
Your game's up, brother!

1423
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:45,666
And, I will make you pay for this.

1424
01:20:45,959 --> 01:20:48,708
You will have to
clean up all this mess.

1425
01:20:49,126 --> 01:20:51,583
And you can tag in too.
- Stay in your limits, okay.

1426
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:53,041
You mind your limits, understood.

1427
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:55,750
Or else, l will really kick your a**

1428
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:56,875
Sit down.

1429
01:20:56,876 --> 01:20:58,125
Slap him, brother.
- Shut up.

1430
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,916
You've turned my life into a big joke!

1431
01:21:09,251 --> 01:21:10,666
I've no place!

1432
01:21:15,001 --> 01:21:18,166
I was quietly making
a road for myself.

1433
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:20,500
But you just ruined everything.

1434
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,250
You made me divorcee...
- Quiet!

1435
01:21:23,709 --> 01:21:25,458
Bitti's mother wants
to make you her son-in-law.

1436
01:21:25,459 --> 01:21:27,166
What else could I do? Tell me.

1437
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:29,333
Helped you instead.

1438
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,583
I did what l thought was
right at that moment, that's it.

1439
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:36,791
What about my heart
that got shattered?

1440
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:38,708
What about that?

1441
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:41,041
Who told you to lock eyes with Rama?

1442
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:44,208
Just help me get my love, and then...

1443
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:46,208
...you can go anywhere you want,
I don't care.

1444
01:21:47,584 --> 01:21:50,250
You...you're such a selfish man.

1445
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:53,583
I mean...you can ruin anyone's
life for the sake of your life.

1446
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:58,916
I am done with being exploited.

1447
01:21:59,459 --> 01:22:01,958
I tried my best to be your friend.

1448
01:22:04,334 --> 01:22:06,083
Now, I will show you.

1449
01:22:07,084 --> 01:22:08,083
Just watch...

1450
01:22:08,292 --> 01:22:10,791
Tell me what you can do.

1451
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,583
Nothing much.

1452
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:15,916
I will steal Bitti
from right under your nose.

1453
01:22:18,626 --> 01:22:19,541
Just watch.

1454
01:22:19,959 --> 01:22:22,666
This hair style l gave
you is really amazing.

1455
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:25,208
But, have you seen
your face in the mirror?

1456
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:27,958
You can't even woo a boy.

1457
01:22:29,459 --> 01:22:31,250
If girls only cared about looks...

1458
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:34,333
...then half of the boys in lndia
would've still been bachelors.

1459
01:22:34,334 --> 01:22:35,291
Understood.

1460
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:39,708
l will take away Bitti
from you...it's a dare.

1461
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:42,791
Let's imagine that you
do get married to Bitti...

1462
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:45,875
...then, I'll play the
trumpet at your wedding.

1463
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:48,000
And I’ll decorate the flowers.
Now get lost.

1464
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:51,666
Better start preparing.

1465
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:01,958
Brother,
he turned out to be a traitor.

1466
01:23:02,292 --> 01:23:03,625
Trying to foil our plans.

1467
01:23:04,667 --> 01:23:07,250
Bitti will apply henna on her hands.
Not cow dung.

1468
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:09,541
There's nothing he can do.

1469
01:23:11,459 --> 01:23:12,458
Aunty, where is Bitti?

1470
01:23:12,792 --> 01:23:14,000
She is upstairs.

1471
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:17,958
Chirag, come here. Sit.

1472
01:23:19,584 --> 01:23:23,125
Son, where does Bitti
keep wondering at nights?

1473
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:26,166
She's a girl after all, not a witch.

1474
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,916
Why don't you talk to her?
- Don't worry, aunty.

1475
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:30,250
I'll talk to her.

1476
01:23:30,501 --> 01:23:33,083
Just make some tea. Hot...

1477
01:23:33,292 --> 01:23:34,166
Okay.

1478
01:23:39,126 --> 01:23:40,083
How are you, Rama?

1479
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:42,541
It's entirely my fault.

1480
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:44,250
I shouldn't have brought
that imbecile here.

1481
01:23:44,834 --> 01:23:45,708
All he did was write a book...

1482
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:46,916
...and now he think's
he's Ghalib (Poet)!

1483
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:48,791
Thank God Rama rejected him.

1484
01:23:49,084 --> 01:23:50,250
Good for nothing...

1485
01:23:50,834 --> 01:23:52,666
Letters for you...
and proposal for Rama.

1486
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:54,083
This is not the way.

1487
01:23:55,292 --> 01:23:57,291
You don't have to be sad, Bitti.

1488
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:00,291
Why would I be sad?

1489
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:05,333
He's just a divorcee
and not a murderer.

1490
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,625
Maybe she was a b***

1491
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:11,875
I didn't know Rama
would be such a fool.

1492
01:24:11,876 --> 01:24:14,250
And, you're siding with Vidrohi instead.
- What else?

1493
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:17,041
Humiliate him like Rama did.
- How can you say that?

1494
01:24:17,042 --> 01:24:18,333
Do you know everything that happened?

1495
01:24:18,501 --> 01:24:19,583
No, you don't.

1496
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:22,291
A lot of people think
I am wrong, but...

1497
01:24:22,292 --> 01:24:23,541
...does that make me wrong too?

1498
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:28,833
You're not wrong for me, Bitti.

1499
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:30,958
So Vidrohi isn't wrong either.

1500
01:24:40,834 --> 01:24:41,833
Fine.

1501
01:24:46,251 --> 01:24:48,625
Tea, son.
- Tea won't help anymore, aunty.

1502
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:49,875
Then why did you ask me to make one.

1503
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,750
Milk has become so expensive.

1504
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:56,500
I wonder what Bitti
likes about that oaf.

1505
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:59,333
This is a one-sided competition,
brother.

1506
01:25:04,334 --> 01:25:05,375
You didn't go to the office today.

1507
01:25:05,376 --> 01:25:07,000
I took an off for Vidrohi.

1508
01:25:07,209 --> 01:25:08,125
Come on.

1509
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:10,083
There goes your queen.

1510
01:25:10,626 --> 01:25:12,000
Wow...amazing.

1511
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:13,958
Come on, let's end this game.

1512
01:25:13,959 --> 01:25:18,166
Just to be on the safer side,
you should say 'I love you'.

1513
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,791
You see, sometime even a rat...

1514
01:25:22,709 --> 01:25:25,083
...can create obstacles
in a snake's path.

1515
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:28,916
Sari...but I don't
know how to wear this.

1516
01:25:29,417 --> 01:25:30,541
I know how to drape it.

1517
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:37,958
I never imagined that
sari draper will put one on me.

1518
01:25:39,376 --> 01:25:40,541
Okay, brother.

1519
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:42,291
Hello.

1520
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:45,500
Vidrohi has opened
sari shop in Bareilly.

1521
01:25:51,501 --> 01:25:53,083
Hello.
- Hello, Listen...

1522
01:25:53,251 --> 01:25:54,708
You are fire from job.
Don't come now.

1523
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:57,958
You can't fire me...l fire
you from the post of my boss.

1524
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:01,208
You can keep the money you
owe me and eat a cake.

1525
01:26:01,501 --> 01:26:04,291
I should have told
Bitti the truth...

1526
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:08,958
..that I am the author
of Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1527
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,083
And I wrote those letters.

1528
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:13,375
Hello son...

1529
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:21,666
You look smarter than
that Vidrohi, brother.

1530
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:30,458
Actually you look smart anyway,
brother.

1531
01:26:31,334 --> 01:26:33,333
Whether in a group or solo.

1532
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:37,000
You look handsome from every angle.

1533
01:26:39,209 --> 01:26:41,291
You shouldn't make a noise
while eating, it's bad manners.

1534
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:42,958
Quite.

1535
01:26:43,209 --> 01:26:45,708
The real fun in eating a malai malpuha
(Indian sweet) is when you make a noise.

1536
01:26:48,584 --> 01:26:50,750
Up up chap chap (sounds)

1537
01:26:52,209 --> 01:26:53,291
Together now... Chap haa...

1538
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:54,416
Vidrohi.

1539
01:26:55,042 --> 01:26:57,166
Does it matter whether
I am a virgin or not?

1540
01:26:57,667 --> 01:27:00,125
Virgin? What's that?

1541
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:02,125
And, when l don't even
know what it means...

1542
01:27:02,126 --> 01:27:03,208
...how can it bother me?

1543
01:27:04,834 --> 01:27:05,958
Cheers to that.

1544
01:27:07,209 --> 01:27:08,666
Do you like watching films?

1545
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:10,833
I like watching English films.

1546
01:27:11,042 --> 01:27:12,500
I see...
- Yes.

1547
01:27:13,209 --> 01:27:14,750
Do you know English?

1548
01:27:16,459 --> 01:27:17,750
I did once...

1549
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:19,958
...but, l didn't like it.
So, I sent it back.

1550
01:27:24,251 --> 01:27:25,291
Hold it properly.

1551
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:30,416
The time to say
'I love you' is gone.

1552
01:27:32,042 --> 01:27:34,791
We just need to wait
and see who Bitti chooses.

1553
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:37,291
Me...

1554
01:27:39,751 --> 01:27:40,791
...or him.

1555
01:27:41,667 --> 01:27:43,416
You had a problem when l was single.

1556
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:44,958
And now, when l want to get married...

1557
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:45,833
...you still have a problem.

1558
01:27:45,834 --> 01:27:47,833
There is no problem, dear.

1559
01:27:48,376 --> 01:27:52,166
I never stopped you before, and
I won't stop you now either.

1560
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:57,250
But...think before
you take any decision.

1561
01:27:57,251 --> 01:27:58,541
What's to think?

1562
01:27:59,334 --> 01:28:02,291
She's marrying a boy.
That's all that matters to me.

1563
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:04,250
Yeah, of course, you'll be happy.

1564
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:05,416
Finally, you're getting
rid of this headache.

1565
01:28:05,584 --> 01:28:06,916
I have every reason to be happy.

1566
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:11,500
When your daughter's
staying with you...

1567
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:13,291
...you keep thinking
when she will leave.

1568
01:28:14,876 --> 01:28:16,750
And, when she's about to leave...

1569
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,291
...you can't stop thinking how
you're going to live without her.

1570
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:26,541
Papa, I won't go if you start crying.

1571
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:28,208
Don't listen to him.

1572
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:30,583
He has tears even
if someone pinches him.

1573
01:28:30,876 --> 01:28:32,208
What's wrong?

1574
01:28:33,084 --> 01:28:35,041
Fine, I'll get some
tea for you with sugar.

1575
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:36,666
Move, son.

1576
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:44,791
Do you have a cigarette?

1577
01:28:52,459 --> 01:28:54,166
That you want to spend
the rest of your life with him.

1578
01:28:55,834 --> 01:28:57,291
All he did was write a book.

1579
01:28:58,001 --> 01:29:00,291
Well, it did matter before.

1580
01:29:01,209 --> 01:29:04,291
But now, it doesn't matter
whether he wrote that book or not.

1581
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:10,125
AIl that matters now is that
Vidrohi is not a bad guy.

1582
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:14,625
He loves me and...
I'll be happy with him.

1583
01:29:16,334 --> 01:29:17,208
Right?

1584
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:20,875
Judging by the way you are, Bitti...

1585
01:29:21,626 --> 01:29:26,083
...you'll come across many more
people in life, who'll love you.

1586
01:29:27,251 --> 01:29:28,458
Will you marry anyone?

1587
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:31,833
Which people are you talking about?

1588
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:35,041
Do you know how many
times I've been rejected?

1589
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:38,791
Who is willing to marry me?

1590
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,750
You've too have known
me for a long time now.

1591
01:29:45,501 --> 01:29:46,958
But you didn't fall in love.

1592
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:53,541
I know I've certain faults, Chirag.

1593
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:58,750
But if Vidrohi still likes me,
then what's the problem?

1594
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:01,750
Why would I have a problem?
- Then...

1595
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:07,375
My only advice is that
you shouldn't be hasty.

1596
01:30:07,626 --> 01:30:09,500
What hasty?

1597
01:30:11,042 --> 01:30:13,708
Look, I’ve thought this through,
before making a decision.

1598
01:30:16,209 --> 01:30:18,541
And please don't think I
am making a compromise.

1599
01:30:29,459 --> 01:30:30,541
Catch.

1600
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:37,125
I told you I'll steal Bitti
from right under your nose.

1601
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:39,625
And I did.

1602
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:46,541
Our engagement's been fixed.

1603
01:30:51,417 --> 01:30:52,250
See you.

1604
01:30:53,292 --> 01:30:54,958
Regards to your mother.

1605
01:30:56,709 --> 01:30:58,958
Stop it...
Let me catch my breath.

1606
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:02,000
I've been holding myself
back for a long time.

1607
01:31:02,001 --> 01:31:03,625
lf l let go,
you'll have nothing to hold on to.

1608
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:05,583
Bloody Vidrohi...
- Move.

1609
01:31:08,292 --> 01:31:10,500
I'm destined to kill a bearded guy.

1610
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:13,458
So stay away.

1611
01:31:15,126 --> 01:31:19,750
You knew...how much I love Bitti.
l loved her a lot.

1612
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:23,250
You used to call her sister-in-law.

1613
01:31:24,292 --> 01:31:25,625
Why did you betray me?

1614
01:31:27,251 --> 01:31:28,291
Why did you do it?

1615
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:30,166
Did Bitti love you?

1616
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:32,000
Huh?

1617
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:37,375
I loved Rama...but she didn't.

1618
01:31:37,834 --> 01:31:38,791
So, what should l do?

1619
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:41,416
Sit in a corner and cry like a woman?

1620
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:44,041
Get this through your skull...

1621
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:47,250
Bitti loves me.

1622
01:31:48,584 --> 01:31:49,625
Okay?

1623
01:31:50,876 --> 01:31:54,250
Now, find someone else
for your ailing heart.

1624
01:31:55,334 --> 01:31:58,125
Because, if anyone now tries
to come between Bitti and me...

1625
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:02,250
...I swear, I will make him pay.

1626
01:32:08,251 --> 01:32:09,958
Do show up for the engagement, brother

1627
01:32:13,209 --> 01:32:14,833
We haven't called
for the musical band.

1628
01:32:16,584 --> 01:32:17,500
Listen...

1629
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:23,333
This attitude you're showing off...

1630
01:32:25,334 --> 01:32:27,083
It's my gift to you.

1631
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,291
And, when Bitti learns the truth...

1632
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:33,250
...she will kick you out.

1633
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:35,041
I see...

1634
01:32:36,501 --> 01:32:38,083
And, who's going to tell Bitti?

1635
01:32:38,917 --> 01:32:41,833
Your...best friend, or you?

1636
01:32:42,084 --> 01:32:43,125
Who's going to tell her?

1637
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:48,250
Look...if I'm heartbroken

1638
01:32:50,459 --> 01:32:52,041
I'll break everyone's heart.

1639
01:32:54,209 --> 01:32:55,541
I won't let it happen again.

1640
01:32:58,376 --> 01:32:59,875
You will never change, brother.

1641
01:33:02,792 --> 01:33:03,958
Fine, go tell her.

1642
01:33:11,876 --> 01:33:14,000
Why isn't the light glowing?

1643
01:33:14,292 --> 01:33:16,666
The light glowing, uncle.
- Then, why can't l see it?

1644
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:18,666
Lt dim light uncle.
Will shine clearly in the night.

1645
01:33:18,834 --> 01:33:20,416
I see, it will look better at night.

1646
01:33:20,834 --> 01:33:22,833
Then keep them closer,
show I've spent money.

1647
01:33:23,001 --> 01:33:24,750
The lights should shine bright, ok .

1648
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:28,500
Put it up there...stop bothering me.

1649
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:29,958
Yes, there.

1650
01:33:31,042 --> 01:33:34,083
Aunty, where is Bitti?
- She must be in the room upstairs.

1651
01:33:35,334 --> 01:33:37,541
Why is he looking so dull today?

1652
01:34:02,126 --> 01:34:03,291
How am I looking?

1653
01:34:05,667 --> 01:34:07,041
Very beautiful.

1654
01:34:15,459 --> 01:34:16,833
What's wrong with you?

1655
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:18,583
What can be wrong with me?

1656
01:34:19,126 --> 01:34:20,375
You don't look happy.

1657
01:34:21,292 --> 01:34:22,833
You look really happy.

1658
01:34:23,626 --> 01:34:24,750
I am very happy.

1659
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:31,458
You had something to say?

1660
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,291
Chirag.

1661
01:34:36,751 --> 01:34:39,958
Yes, aunty.
- Come down, son. l need you here.

1662
01:34:44,501 --> 01:34:48,000
Listen, son. Come here.

1663
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:50,958
Such a pretty ring.

1664
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:52,291
Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

1665
01:34:52,459 --> 01:34:55,333
I really like it a lot.

1666
01:34:55,334 --> 01:34:57,083
Give me your hand, son.

1667
01:34:57,084 --> 01:35:00,000
Let's see how it looks on Vidrohi's finger?
- Aunty...

1668
01:35:00,001 --> 01:35:02,708
Aunty, why...
- Let me see, son.

1669
01:35:03,209 --> 01:35:05,541
Oh my, it looks so pretty.

1670
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:07,791
See, Rama, how does it look?

1671
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:09,500
It really looks good, aunty.
- It does, doesn't it?

1672
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,125
Even I like it a lot.

1673
01:35:11,126 --> 01:35:13,083
Now, this is one good thing that happened.
- Have some more.

1674
01:35:13,084 --> 01:35:15,166
Come on, son, keep it back in the box.

1675
01:35:20,334 --> 01:35:21,791
What happened?
- lt's stuck, aunty.

1676
01:35:22,001 --> 01:35:25,750
How can it be stuck? Turn it around.
- What have you done?

1677
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:28,375
Turn it around.
- Pull it out, aunty.

1678
01:35:28,542 --> 01:35:31,916
How did it get stuck?
- I’ll hold his hand and you pull it out.

1679
01:35:31,917 --> 01:35:33,666
I can't get it out.
- Try to remove it.

1680
01:35:33,667 --> 01:35:35,875
Someone get butter.
- Pull.

1681
01:35:35,876 --> 01:35:38,833
Get some soap.
- What happened?

1682
01:35:39,042 --> 01:35:41,041
What are you doing?
- Pull, aunty.

1683
01:35:41,209 --> 01:35:43,791
The ring is stuck on the finger.
- How can it get stuck?

1684
01:35:44,001 --> 01:35:46,041
What's wrong?
Why are you all screaming?

1685
01:35:46,334 --> 01:35:49,833
I only wanted to see how it looked,
but I didn't know...

1686
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:51,708
She'll get it out...you go.

1687
01:35:52,042 --> 01:35:53,250
Be quiet, she'll do it.

1688
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:15,541
"You're untouched by
the norms of the world."

1689
01:36:15,959 --> 01:36:21,541
"You're the grace in my eyes."

1690
01:36:21,751 --> 01:36:25,458
"Every breath l take..."

1691
01:36:25,459 --> 01:36:28,375
"...and in all my dreams..."

1692
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:33,625
"l see your prints everywhere l look."

1693
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:39,125
"O wanderer... I am in love..."

1694
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:42,375
"Love with you."

1695
01:36:45,834 --> 01:36:51,083
"O wanderer... I am in love..."

1696
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:54,250
"Love with you."

1697
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:11,916
"You're like the shadow
of a soaring bird."

1698
01:37:12,084 --> 01:37:17,458
"The boat that floats carelessly."

1699
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:24,208
"You cannot settle down..."

1700
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:30,208
"...because,
you're like the caravan of a nomad."

1701
01:37:30,501 --> 01:37:36,500
"l am treading...on the footsteps,
you've left behind."

1702
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:42,583
"Wondering whether we'll ever meet."

1703
01:37:42,751 --> 01:37:48,083
"O wanderer... I am in love..."

1704
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:50,625
"Love with you."

1705
01:37:54,792 --> 01:37:59,875
"O wanderer... I am in love..."

1706
01:38:00,084 --> 01:38:03,125
"Love with you."

1707
01:38:03,334 --> 01:38:09,166
"Love with you."

1708
01:38:09,334 --> 01:38:12,458
"Love with you."

1709
01:38:12,626 --> 01:38:15,208
"Love with you."

1710
01:38:17,251 --> 01:38:20,583
"Love with you."

1711
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:36,666
What did sister-in-law say?

1712
01:38:39,042 --> 01:38:40,500
I couldn't gather
the courage to tell her.

1713
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:41,583
Why?

1714
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:44,875
She's very happy with Vidrohi.

1715
01:38:47,251 --> 01:38:48,958
How could I break her heart?

1716
01:38:54,417 --> 01:38:56,250
I was very selfish, Munna.

1717
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:03,416
I couldn't see anything beyond
my happiness alone.

1718
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,250
Well...

1719
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:11,291
Love taught me to
be happy in other's happiness.

1720
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:20,000
And Vidrohi's not a bad guy either.

1721
01:39:23,876 --> 01:39:26,083
You're not a villain, brother.

1722
01:40:01,917 --> 01:40:03,000
How are you, brother?

1723
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:07,083
Fine.

1724
01:40:08,376 --> 01:40:09,541
Sorry, man.

1725
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:14,333
It was entirely my fault.

1726
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:19,958
I troubled you without a reason.

1727
01:40:29,792 --> 01:40:30,875
It's okay.

1728
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:38,541
Here.

1729
01:40:39,209 --> 01:40:40,333
What's this?

1730
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:44,958
I've written something...for Bitti.

1731
01:40:45,792 --> 01:40:47,500
It's from you...

1732
01:40:49,834 --> 01:40:52,875
...because you're a really bad writer.

1733
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:59,250
Read this out at your engagement.

1734
01:41:00,292 --> 01:41:01,583
She will like it.

1735
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,583
Please come to my engagement, brother.

1736
01:41:07,792 --> 01:41:09,208
It will make me really happy.

1737
01:41:11,709 --> 01:41:13,250
I don't have any choice now.

1738
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:19,500
Even today, there's not a
single dull moment in Mishra Sadan.'

1739
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:23,666
'Poor Romeo...is making sweets.'

1740
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:26,000
Listen...
- Greetings, uncle.

1741
01:41:26,001 --> 01:41:27,833
Congratulation.

1742
01:41:27,834 --> 01:41:29,125
Chirag.

1743
01:41:29,126 --> 01:41:31,875
Pour some milk in that coffee machine.

1744
01:41:32,126 --> 01:41:34,125
Yes, uncle.
- Look here...

1745
01:41:34,126 --> 01:41:37,875
Hello, sister. Hello...
- Bless you son..

1746
01:41:39,917 --> 01:41:41,291
Upstairs, go on...
- Yes.

1747
01:41:41,292 --> 01:41:44,375
Look here,
your friend is making sweets.

1748
01:41:44,584 --> 01:41:45,375
Go... go.

1749
01:41:45,834 --> 01:41:46,833
Come, son.

1750
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:49,250
The function is upstairs.
- There's a problem, brother.

1751
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:50,500
What's wrong with your voice.

1752
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:51,666
That's the problem.

1753
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:53,958
My mother made tea
from curdled milk...

1754
01:41:54,209 --> 01:41:56,750
And this is what happened.
- What now?

1755
01:41:57,834 --> 01:42:04,000
Now, who's going to read this letter?
- Who?

1756
01:42:04,542 --> 01:42:05,958
Munna, you read it.
- No...

1757
01:42:06,626 --> 01:42:08,375
You read it then.
- How can l read it?

1758
01:42:08,376 --> 01:42:09,666
What are you saying?

1759
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:12,375
Hello...Thank you for coming.

1760
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:14,291
Be happy son.

1761
01:42:14,292 --> 01:42:16,083
You read it.
- Let's go upstairs.

1762
01:42:16,084 --> 01:42:17,083
Please read it.

1763
01:42:17,459 --> 01:42:20,208
Please read it. Brother.
- Fill it with clarified butter.

1764
01:42:20,209 --> 01:42:21,625
Bitti...

1765
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:26,416
Look now, your electricity
department is betraying us.

1766
01:42:29,876 --> 01:42:31,708
Lallan, coffee.

1767
01:42:31,876 --> 01:42:33,791
Coffee...
- Here she is.

1768
01:42:34,001 --> 01:42:37,291
Papa
- Wow... so beautiful.

1769
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:43,833
That way, dear. That way.
- You're looking so beautiful, my child.

1770
01:42:43,834 --> 01:42:45,458
That way?
- Let's go.

1771
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:48,708
Sit here.

1772
01:42:51,167 --> 01:42:52,708
Sit here.
- Yes

1773
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,333
So beautiful.
The curly hair looks so nice.

1774
01:42:55,334 --> 01:42:58,250
Don't touch it.
- Don't touch her hair, you'll ruin it.

1775
01:42:58,417 --> 01:43:00,250
Excuse me...
my dear brothers...

1776
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:05,333
...and sisters, except for one.
- What's wrong with his voice?

1777
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:07,083
Don't know.
- Mothers and Fathers...

1778
01:43:07,084 --> 01:43:08,958
On the auspicious
occasion of my engagement...

1779
01:43:09,501 --> 01:43:12,958
...I've written something for you,
Bitti, straight from my heart.

1780
01:43:13,792 --> 01:43:15,583
But if l read it out in this voice...

1781
01:43:15,584 --> 01:43:17,250
...then, you'll all get depressed.

1782
01:43:18,001 --> 01:43:24,333
So, my best friend Chirag
will read it out for me.

1783
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:25,875
Come on, Chirag.

1784
01:43:26,209 --> 01:43:27,625
I'll go sit there.
- Yeah...

1785
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:30,333
It's hard to hear anything from here.
- He's written a letter...for you.

1786
01:43:30,334 --> 01:43:32,291
Come sister-in-law
- Sit here...

1787
01:43:33,167 --> 01:43:34,166
Move aside.

1788
01:43:43,501 --> 01:43:45,041
"Bareilly Ki Barfi...Bitti!"

1789
01:43:47,917 --> 01:43:49,041
"You must be wondering..."

1790
01:43:49,292 --> 01:43:51,291
"I've already written
so much about you..."

1791
01:43:51,292 --> 01:43:53,125
"...that what do I have left to say."

1792
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:57,041
You wouldn't have
the slightest clue..."

1793
01:43:57,042 --> 01:44:00,958
"...but I've enough to say about you
which can last an entire lifetime."

1794
01:44:04,501 --> 01:44:06,166
"Some think you're short-tempered."

1795
01:44:07,084 --> 01:44:08,416
"Some think you're spoilt."

1796
01:44:09,376 --> 01:44:10,875
"Your mother amusingly says that..."

1797
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:13,041
"...when you wander out at nights,
you look like a witch."

1798
01:44:14,334 --> 01:44:16,208
"Some times you're odd..."

1799
01:44:17,251 --> 01:44:18,875
"...and some times
you're very interesting."

1800
01:44:23,376 --> 01:44:26,250
"But l swear,
I like everything about you."

1801
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:30,166
Oh, God. What just happened?

1802
01:44:33,417 --> 01:44:35,416
Oh no, not another power-cut.

1803
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,833
He was reading
such a romantic letter.

1804
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:39,541
See...

1805
01:44:39,751 --> 01:44:41,041
There's a power cut
in the entire city...

1806
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:42,125
...but power will be
restored soon enough.

1807
01:44:42,126 --> 01:44:43,583
We regret the inconvenience caused.

1808
01:44:48,334 --> 01:44:49,625
You're very strange.

1809
01:44:53,001 --> 01:44:54,958
Every time you laugh,
your front tooth's visible.

1810
01:44:57,042 --> 01:44:59,000
Even your gums light up.

1811
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:02,541
Every time you cry,
your nose starts running.

1812
01:45:04,584 --> 01:45:05,625
You get happy without a reason...

1813
01:45:05,626 --> 01:45:07,375
...and lose your temper
over trivial things.

1814
01:45:10,792 --> 01:45:12,625
It's not easy to love you.

1815
01:45:15,084 --> 01:45:18,250
But, it's harder to not love you.

1816
01:45:28,001 --> 01:45:31,958
You're like this light in my life.

1817
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:42,416
And no one in this world,
can love you as much as I do.

1818
01:45:46,209 --> 01:45:47,500
Let's make a bet.

1819
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:53,000
And, if I lose...you
can take anything you want.

1820
01:45:57,167 --> 01:45:58,583
Will you marry me?

1821
01:46:20,417 --> 01:46:21,500
Yes.

1822
01:46:23,209 --> 01:46:24,708
Come, Vidrohi.

1823
01:46:31,792 --> 01:46:33,583
How long are you going to hide it?

1824
01:46:38,251 --> 01:46:41,041
I know who wrote Bareilly Ki Barfi.

1825
01:46:43,001 --> 01:46:44,458
Along with all those letters.

1826
01:46:46,501 --> 01:46:47,791
I know everything.

1827
01:46:49,584 --> 01:46:51,041
But, who told you?

1828
01:46:55,292 --> 01:46:56,250
Munna?

1829
01:46:56,417 --> 01:46:57,666
I am not a traitor, brother.

1830
01:46:57,667 --> 01:46:59,375
I am on your side.
l don't know.

1831
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:03,708
Yes, son,
I just found out a few days ago.

1832
01:47:04,001 --> 01:47:06,666
And we started preparing since then.

1833
01:47:07,917 --> 01:47:09,000
Then...

1834
01:47:11,167 --> 01:47:12,375
Vidrohi.

1835
01:47:13,417 --> 01:47:15,041
Vidrohi got emotional.

1836
01:47:16,167 --> 01:47:18,500
When I tried to console him,...

1837
01:47:19,667 --> 01:47:20,958
...he spilled out everything.

1838
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:23,375
'Chirag is the author
of Bareilly Ki Barfi'.

1839
01:47:23,376 --> 01:47:24,958
'These two got me in this mess.'

1840
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:30,541
You could've told
me if you already knew.

1841
01:47:30,792 --> 01:47:32,541
But I didn't know...

1842
01:47:33,167 --> 01:47:38,916
...whether you really love me,
or maybe because...

1843
01:47:38,917 --> 01:47:40,625
...you see Babli in me.

1844
01:47:42,042 --> 01:47:44,666
And it was very important
for me to find out.

1845
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:48,958
Hence I played this charade.

1846
01:47:54,376 --> 01:47:56,500
Through Mr. Bishnoi we booked...

1847
01:47:56,876 --> 01:47:58,833
Oh no...

1848
01:48:01,834 --> 01:48:03,291
'Cheers to that.'

1849
01:48:04,501 --> 01:48:05,583
You didn't fall in love with me.

1850
01:48:05,751 --> 01:48:07,875
I tested you at every step.

1851
01:48:08,084 --> 01:48:10,125
But you passed every test.

1852
01:48:11,417 --> 01:48:13,291
I troubled you a lot, didn't I?

1853
01:48:15,251 --> 01:48:17,291
Sorry.
- Don't say sorry.

1854
01:48:19,292 --> 01:48:21,333
Bitti, here you go.

1855
01:48:21,834 --> 01:48:22,708
Adorn it.

1856
01:48:23,584 --> 01:48:27,375
But, I don't have one.
I didn't come prepared.

1857
01:48:27,542 --> 01:48:28,958
What will he adorn?
- Brother Chirag.

1858
01:48:29,292 --> 01:48:30,375
Look at him.

1859
01:48:42,334 --> 01:48:47,458
Like I said...
Bitti's my sister-in-law.

1860
01:48:47,459 --> 01:48:49,083
I will slap you..

1861
01:48:52,542 --> 01:48:55,625
I troubled you a lot.
- It's alright.

1862
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,458
Adorn it.

1863
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:15,541
I'm going to frame this.

1864
01:49:15,834 --> 01:49:17,250
I'll never forget this ever.

1865
01:49:21,334 --> 01:49:22,291
Papa.

1866
01:49:39,917 --> 01:49:41,291
But this didn't fit.

1867
01:49:41,292 --> 01:49:43,750
We took your measurement
yesterday, son.

1868
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:46,625
You guys really made
me dance to your tunes.

1869
01:49:52,334 --> 01:49:53,583
Coffee's here...

1870
01:49:55,959 --> 01:49:58,791
There's never a power
cut when you need one.

1871
01:50:11,251 --> 01:50:13,458
'A story with a name
like 'Barfi' (sweet)...'

1872
01:50:13,876 --> 01:50:16,333
'...will always have a happy ending.'

1873
01:50:17,792 --> 01:50:18,750
How is it?

1874
01:50:20,501 --> 01:50:21,291
Spicy.

1875
01:50:23,667 --> 01:50:26,666
They are now made for each other.'

1876
01:50:35,459 --> 01:50:38,000
'Oh...we completely forgot
to offer you sweets.'

1877
01:50:38,334 --> 01:50:42,625
'Now Vidrohi explains English
films to Rama in his own style.'

1878
01:50:43,334 --> 01:50:46,000
'But unfortunately, in theatres,
the corner seat is a rarity....

1879
01:50:46,001 --> 01:50:48,166
'...when their mother's
sticking around.'

1880
01:50:48,334 --> 01:50:50,458
'Chirag, Munna, and Vidrohi...'

1881
01:50:50,709 --> 01:50:53,458
'...have become more
than just best friends.'

1882
01:50:54,292 --> 01:50:55,708
'Well, there's just Mr.
Mishra left now.'

1883
01:50:56,167 --> 01:50:58,250
'During the day,
he listens to his wife...'

1884
01:50:58,251 --> 01:51:00,250
'...and at night,
he talks to the fan.'

1885
01:51:00,667 --> 01:51:02,125
'If you visit Bareilly again...'

1886
01:51:02,292 --> 01:51:05,208
'...then, instead of wasting
time looking for the earrings...'

1887
01:51:05,501 --> 01:51:07,708
'...opt for 'Barfi'
(sweets) instead.'

1888
01:51:07,709 --> 01:51:11,041
"Your earrings make
my heart skip a beat."

1889
01:51:11,209 --> 01:51:14,791
"When you shake the waist,
it steals millions of hearts."

1890
01:51:14,792 --> 01:51:16,666
"Stop taunting me...

1891
01:51:16,667 --> 01:51:18,541
Don't be a wise guy."

1892
01:51:18,542 --> 01:51:20,416
"l am not Juliet,

1893
01:51:20,417 --> 01:51:22,625
And you're not my Romeo."

1894
01:51:24,292 --> 01:51:27,291
"O Sweety..."

1895
01:51:27,626 --> 01:51:31,458
"O Sweety your drama,
creates a stir."

1896
01:51:31,459 --> 01:51:35,208
"This is unfair."

1897
01:51:35,209 --> 01:51:38,833
"Believe it or not,
we're crazy about you..."

1898
01:51:38,834 --> 01:51:42,333
"Listen o sweetheart,
we're your beloved."

1899
01:51:42,334 --> 01:51:43,208
"DJ."

1900
01:51:45,542 --> 01:51:46,291
"Crazy"

1901
01:51:57,292 --> 01:51:59,166
