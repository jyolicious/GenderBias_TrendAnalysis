00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,135
How many stars
spa_le in the sky?

2
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:53,967
Ever tried countinQ them?

3
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:01,906
lt would take 6,OOO years to
count those in our Qalaxy alone

4
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,534
How many such galaxies exist?

5
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:08,569
Scientists reckon
mo billion more

6
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:14,303
lsn't it possible that amongst
these billions oF celestial bodies

7
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:18,069
a planet with people
like us exists?

8
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:22,169
As we explore space
IookinQ For them,

9
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:26,869
couldn't they be cominQ here,
IookinQ For us?

10
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:57,829
Hindi pop sonQ

11
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:20,669
What the thief stole was the
gadget to r_all his spaceship

12
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,336
Without this remote
he could not return home

13
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:29,103
He neither knew our language,
nor had a friend here

14
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:33,302
Alone, anguished,
his only thought was...

15
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,667
.. how will l return home?

16
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:03,537
On the pathway of Time
LiFe is but a brieF name

17
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:09,603
In its Iuminous mist
We wish, we dream, we exist

18
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,834
But on a beautiFul bend

19
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,868
A stranger may we rmet

20
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:19,101

where Papa was headed

159
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,304
Since childhood one Face had
surrounded us: His Holiness

160
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,134
Bye Mom

161
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,602
from bags to bathr_m walls,

162
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,002
he was omnipresent

163
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:33,936
Even For a root canal
he would set the auspicious time

164
00:17:35,432 --> 00:17:40,403
He had Qined Papa a God box
with a deity for evey task

165
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:45,369
Goddess of Wealth
For the stock ma_et

Web-based worship and
sacred sweets by courier

were his innovations

169
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:05,468
Hail, Your Holiness

170
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,000

Why this fatal infatuation?

173
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,435
Pick up a pen and write

174
00:18:30,933 --> 00:18:32,234

00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:07,272
Histoy stands witness:
these people scheme and betray

185
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:11,136
He will pursue
carnal pleasures

186

But will never mary you.
He'll vanish

187
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:19,470
Come home now! One more
night there, and you're dead to us

191
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:35,833
Hello!

192
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,467
What happened?

193
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:42,833
Do you love me?

194
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,000
Of course l do. Why?

195
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,802
- Will you mary me?

196
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:49,933
Yes or no, Sa_araz?

197
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,100
- Yes, but...

198
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:53,333
Tomorrow?

199
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,167
Tomorrow we get married

200
00:19:57,332 --> 00:20:00,868
His prophecy is wrong.

201
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:17,034
Mr James Herrick and
Miss Oprah Brown, you're next

He said: marriage isn't just
bemeen individuals, but Families

211
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,368
Our Faiths, countries,
cultures are diFferent

212
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:50,334
We can never be happy
iF our Families are unhappy

217
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:26,770
l came back to my city, but
my parents refused to see me

218
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,901
l joined a news channel
as a repo_er

219
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,333
Today's stoy:
a depressed dog

220
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:33,000
That's our breaking news!

221
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:36,902
Some days we had news,
some days we fabricated it

222
00:21:57,265 --> 00:22:00,401
Missing: God

223
00:22:01,332 --> 00:22:04,101
lf found, contact Tipsy

224
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:10,268
There's a stoy in this man.
l'll see you at office

225
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,267
Don't be late!

226
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,934
Excuse me?

227
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,933
Why are you
handing these out?

228
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,667
l have a case
pending with Him

229
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:33,867
He neither solves it,
nor meets me

230
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:36,367
My life is kaput

231
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,201
He's gone into hiding

232
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,901
Have you seen Him around?

233
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:46,700
No

234
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:57,840
Hail Goddess,
Hail Holy Mother

235
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,270
Hail Goddess,
Hail Holy Mother

236
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:04,868
By the way,
what's with the helmet?

237
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:07,134
Got the idea from taxi-tops

238
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:10,234
Yellow yells out from miles

239
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:13,668
Taxis are spotted
easily in traffic

240
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:17,601
- So?
- So God can spot me easy!

241
00:23:17,866 --> 00:23:21,970
How else will he spot me
in this crowd?

242
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:32,700
A bit to your left - pe_ect!

243
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:34,166
Ok, background?

244
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:36,100
Cue Jaggu

245
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,802
They say
animals are not suicidal

246
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:44,236
Here's Nikku.
Mr Sweetie Singh's dog

247
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:48,335
Nikku has attempted
suicide thrice

248
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,137
Jumping off a roof, licking sleeping
pills, hopping onto a gas burner

249
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,634
What's wrong with Nikku?

250
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:59,869
ls Nikku prey to a
mental problem?

251
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,867
ls Nikku...

252
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,767
What's wrong Jaggu?

253
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:07,900
What is this shit, Mitu?

254
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:15,635
Our chat with famed industrialist
Mr Ratan continues

255
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,534
right after this break

256
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,068
Going well, Ratan?
Some coffee?

257
00:24:21,532 --> 00:24:22,799
Get him some coffee

258
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:25,034
- Chery...
- Oh no!

259
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,635
What's your guess? This dog has
depression, anxiety disorder,

260
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:32,069
schizophrenia, or ADHD?

261
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,200
Whatever,
why would l care?

262
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:35,532
Exactly

263
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:40,537
Why would anyone care?
Then why do we air such bull?

264
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,067
What would you rather air?

265
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,534
Hold him please

266
00:24:47,232 --> 00:24:48,266
See this?

267
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,735
l met a guy distributing
these pamphlets

268
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,868
- He is searching for God.
- Found Him?

269
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:57,033
No... but

270
00:24:57,132 --> 00:25:01,469
Searching for God - that's religion.
Finding God - that's news

271
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,968
lf he finds God, get him.
l'll put him on air

272
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,034

273
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,768
No news on religion,
no news on God. Finished

274
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,667
Man, you've changed!

275
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:13,100
Where's the fighter,
Chery Bajwa?

276
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,968
You wanna see the fighter?

277
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,067
Take a good look

278
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:21,001
There are three marks here

279
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:23,000
These aren't birthmarks

280
00:25:23,132 --> 00:25:27,536
l ran a show against His Holiness,
your Dad's Guru

281
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,035
His devotees shoved a trident
right here in my bum

282

Anchor cominQ to you
in 10 seconds

283

00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,634

That's it

285

Welcome back from the break

290
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:48,002
We were chatting with
famed industrialist Mr Ratan...

291
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:51,068
The boss killed my stoy

292
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,469
But it came back to liFe
mo weeks later

293
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,734

He's stealing

00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,034
Don't let him go!

297
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:19,034
Lifting from the

298
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:19,832
Yes

299
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,667
He's no thief!

300
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,403
While donating
my wallet fell in the box

301
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:27,767
He was getting it out for me

302
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:29,633

Why the stickers then?

- Wait.

00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:13,300
Hi

363
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:18,803
l want your stoy.
Will you share it?

364
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:20,533
Why?

365
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,102
l'm a N reporter.
It's my job

366
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:41,470
- Go on, ask.
- Awesome!

367
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:48,500
Your name?

368
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:51,267
Don't have a name

369
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:54,068
They call me Tipsy here.
Beats me why

370
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:56,501
And what do you do?

371
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,135
l'm an astronaut

372
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:04,300
Astronaut!

373
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,001
Those who shoot off
to the moon?

374
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,502
Been there once.
It's kaput

375
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:13,699
Sure!

376
00:33:14,366 --> 00:33:16,167
So what's your
favorite planet?

377
00:33:16,232 --> 00:33:19,201
- My own.
- l meant besides Earth?

378
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,467
Earth is mega-kaput

379
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,268
l meant my own planet

380
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,003
lt'll show up there at night

381
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,701
We went bananas,

382
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:40,103
when we found another planet
with people like us

383
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:43,235
l was sent here
on a research mission

384
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:45,267
Boy, what a welcome l got!

385
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:47,700
My remote got robbed

386
00:33:48,532 --> 00:33:52,068
Without it,
l can't signal my people

387
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:55,268
and without a signal
they won't come for me

388
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,235
They'll think
it's a perilous planet

389
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,034
That l'm dead as a dodo

390
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:06,266
Hello!

391
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,933
- Listen...
- What?

392
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,667
Let me out.
l want to go home

393
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:14,069
Your Highness, convicts
don't decide that. Cops do

394
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,600
l'm not a thief

395
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:17,334
So say all the thieves

396
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:17,632
Where's officer Pandey?

397
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,467
Out on his rounds

398
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,934
Officer Pandey!

399
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:25,499
Officer Pandey!

400
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,635
Shut up, or you get
a knuckle sandwich

401
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:51,202
You think
l'm talking baloney?

402
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,401
Obviously!

403
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:56,101
ls Hindi the official language
of your planet?

404
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,000
On our planet...

405
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:01,268
.. there's no language!

406
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,268
We read minds.
There's no confusion

407
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:07,468
Here, you utter something
and mean something else

408
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:09,901
A two-letter word can have
four different meanings

409
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:15,136
When you nod and say ''oh'',
it means ''Oh, that's cool''

410
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:19,602
When your eyes pop out,
''oh!'' means bad news

411
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:22,868
''Your mother-in-law
is moving in.'' ''Oh!''

412
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:26,335
When angy, you thunder

413
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,069
''Oh! You'll pay
for that blunder!''

414
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:33,301
And when your thought is deep,
your ''oh'' is long!

415
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,467
''Ohhhhhhh! l see!''

416
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:40,602
As you hear the words,
you gotta watch the expression

417
00:35:40,866 --> 00:35:42,867
to get the real meaning

418
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:47,070
lt's torture!
Took full 6 hours to learn Hindi

419
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,302
A whole language in 6 hours?

420
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:52,968
No one let me hold hands

421
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,534
Finally, a nice lady
Ient her hand

422
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,469
l held it and transferred
her language into my system

423
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:04,403
Man, there's no limit
to your whoppers!

424
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:07,034
ls your hand a USB cable,

425
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:11,036
that transfers files
between computers?

426
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:15,069
And your clothes? Are faded jeans
the rage on your planet too?

427
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,800
Noooo!

428
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:18,199
On our planet...

429
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:22,469
.. no one wears clothes.
There we go bare

430
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:25,802
Here, at first l thought

431
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:29,802
your skins were
different from ours

432
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,467
Some had spa_ly hides,

433
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,401
some jet black

434
00:36:36,466 --> 00:36:39,435
Some hides were colo_ul,
some white

435
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:44,369
Some hides sticky-tight,
some baggy

436
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:49,301
Then one day
l Found a car

437
00:36:49,532 --> 00:36:50,900
A dancinQ car

438
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:02,471
That day l reali_ed
our skins were the same

439
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:07,737
but yours are covered
with a thing called fashion

440
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,769
Radio Commercial

441
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,202
Now l could minQle

442
00:37:19,466 --> 00:37:23,203
Yet l was mocked

443
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,303
Look here -
half man, half woman!

444
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:30,067
Slowly l got it

445
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,235
There's man - fashion
and woman - Fashion

446
00:37:34,032 --> 00:37:35,299
There was day fashion...

447
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,234
.. and night fashion

448
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:38,967
Spo_inQ Fashion...

449
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,768
.. and serving fashion

450
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:47,736
With the clothes,
l Found some photos

451
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:05,404
lt hit me - these photos
meant su_ival

452
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:09,001
You could
swap them for food

453
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:12,668
So l built a po Molio
of this old man's photos

454
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:30,000
What's this?

455
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:36,400
What are these for?

456
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:42,002
Why are you giving me
this junk?

457
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,001
Right! Now we're talking!

458
00:38:47,265 --> 00:38:49,033
Here you go

459
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:54,169
l got it: this photo had value
on just one kind oF paper

460
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,903
On any other paper,
it was wo_hless

461
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,669
For cash and clothes,
dancing cars were widely available

462
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:07,868
They were my bank,
they were my tailor!

463
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:12,001
Once, l got
such magnetic attire

464
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:15,201
that no photos
were n_ed

465
00:39:15,265 --> 00:39:17,600
Food was pulled to me

466
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:19,601
For you, Sir

467
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:25,803
Now, to find my remote, l had to
Iearn this planet's language

468
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:29,069
Without it,
evey task was a trial

469
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,133
Like telling this gentleman

470
00:39:31,265 --> 00:39:34,901
there was a defect
in his Fashion

471
00:39:41,766 --> 00:39:45,035
l felt l had spoilt his fashion

472
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:49,735
So l put it back
where it was

473
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:16,705
[Radio Announcement]

474
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,067
Found him on the road

475
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,801
Some scumbag
hit him and bolted

476
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,634
Seems pretty okay,

477
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,901
but isn't responding

478
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,035
Has his eardrum
called it a day?

479
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,267
Are you deaf?

480
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:40,202
Can hear alright,
but isn't talking

481
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:43,101
Seems in a state of shock

482
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:46,601
Memoy loss, l'm afraid

483
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:00,068
Remember the scumbag
who hit you?

484
00:41:02,265 --> 00:41:04,667
Remember the license plate?

485
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:09,002
Remember anything at all?

486
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:40,735

One knock took your memoy away,

Seen it in the movies

491
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,068
To figure what he was
yappinQ about,

492
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:04,503
l had to hold his hand
and transfer his language

493
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:08,467
Hey!

494
00:42:10,032 --> 00:42:13,468

sense went for a toss?

500
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:29,803

544
00:48:20,766 --> 00:48:22,801
Pepper sat patiently all night

For Full 6 hours,
l transferr_ her language files

546

First time?... Kaput before you kicked off?

548
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,767
Y...y... yes!

549
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:00,600
Where are you from?

550
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,135
Far, far away

551
00:49:07,032 --> 00:49:10,068
From an unheard of village

552
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:12,700
But you speak my lingo!

553
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:18,070
Because l learnt it from you,
Sister

554
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:22,068
Sister! You think
this is a convent? Out!

555
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,033
Bro!

00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:28,233
Bro, wake up!

557
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,400
Bro, wake up!

558
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,066
Bro!

559
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,000
You're talking!

560
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:37,634
Bro, l need your help

561
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,035
Pepper cleared up your throat!

562
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:42,000
Bro, come with me quick

00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,467
lt's urgent, bro!

566
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:53,700
Okay, let's go

567
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,334
Stop... stop!

568
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,400
Stop, bro!

569
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,670
The jerk robbed me
right here

570
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:15,034
l need my chain, bro.
l must get it back

571
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,100
- Precious?
- It's priceless!

572
00:50:17,632 --> 00:50:20,334
The thief must be a local

573
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:23,501
But he'll sell
the loot in Delhi

574
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:27,268
lf he sold pricey stuff here,
he'd get caught

575
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:30,167
Then l must go

576
00:50:30,432 --> 00:50:32,133
Where?

577
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,034
Delhi

578
00:50:57,966 --> 00:50:59,434
- Officer!
- Yeah?

579
00:51:00,032 --> 00:51:03,101
- My remote control is stolen.
- Are you tipsy?

580
00:51:03,366 --> 00:51:06,302
Expect the police force
to track your N remote?

581
00:51:06,966 --> 00:51:09,635
- It's not a N remote!
- Then?

582
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,035
Can't tell you.
But it's like a chain

583
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:15,500
Really precious

584
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:18,435
- Where was it stolen?
- In Mandawa

585
00:51:19,432 --> 00:51:23,369
And you're searching
in Delhi, you idiot?

586
00:51:23,966 --> 00:51:25,634
The thief came to Delhi

587
00:51:25,933 --> 00:51:27,934
- So?
- So where's the thief?

588
00:51:27,966 --> 00:51:30,935
Blockhead!
It's a city of 15 million

589
00:51:31,065 --> 00:51:36,036
Police are human,
not God

590
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:41,068
Only God can help you

591
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:47,570
Surrender to God,
you'll succeed

592
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,304
Only God knows

593
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:56,236
Ask God, not me!

594
00:51:57,132 --> 00:52:00,502
Trust in God, my child

595
00:52:00,966 --> 00:52:06,338
Who was this God chap?
All said only He could help

596
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,002
What l saw blew my mind

597
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:14,102
Earthlings had figur_ out
who had manuFactured them!

598
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:18,870
Their creator lived with them.
He had millions oF houses

599
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:25,438
Ea_hlinQs took their problems to Him,
which He solved For a small Fee

600
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:29,536
My planet had no such Facility

601
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:34,904
l could not believe it!
So decided to test it

602
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:38,900
One take-away God

603
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:42,303
Which one?
Rs 20, 100, 500?

604
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:46,169
Any difference?
In the Rs 20 and Rs 500 ones?

605
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:48,434
Just the size.
Othemise ditto

606
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:52,102
Rs 20 God is
equally efficient?

607
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:56,869
OK, gimme Rs15!
Nothing less

608
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:13,936
God, l am famished.
Get me some food please

609
00:53:25,899 --> 00:53:27,400
l went bananas

610
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:31,936
God actually wo_ed!
Now l could Qo home

611
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,002
God, my remote is stolen

612
00:53:35,232 --> 00:53:38,368
Please find it.
l want to go home

613
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:55,903
God's battey died.
Worked once, then kaput

614
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,400
What do you mean?

615
00:53:57,466 --> 00:53:59,935
Stick a new battey in.
Where does it go?

616
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,103
- It needs no battey.
- Then why is it off?

617
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:07,102
- Manufacturing defect?
- l make no defective stuff

618
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:12,936
- You made this God?
- Of course! With my own hands

619
00:54:13,432 --> 00:54:16,401
You made God,
or God made you?

620
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:21,771
He made us all -
l only make His statues

621
00:54:21,899 --> 00:54:24,067
Why the statues?

622
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:28,002
To worship Him.
To voice our problems

623
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:32,770
ls there a transmitter inside?
How can He hear us?

624
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:38,337
God needs no transmitter.
He hears directly

625
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:41,368
Directly?
Then why the statue?

626
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:44,235
What's with him?

627
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:48,968
Want to bust my business?
What's your problem?

628
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,734
My remote is stolen, Sir

629
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:55,168
l'm requesting God.
But He doesn't reply

630
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,701
- Are you tipsy?
- Meaning?

631
00:54:57,733 --> 00:55:00,869
You're overloading
this pint-sized God

632
00:55:00,899 --> 00:55:03,668
His itty-bitty feet
can't chase the thief

633
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:06,802
Bother the big God
inside the temple

634
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:09,701
He'll run fast

635
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:13,303
Offer Him coconut and money -
He'll deliver

636
00:55:13,366 --> 00:55:15,301
That'll be Rs 20O

637
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:25,037
Earthlings waited with fees
to Qet their wo_ done

638
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:28,168
Full 2 hours later
l got the appointment

639
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:29,833
God,

640
00:55:31,366 --> 00:55:34,869

00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:02,636
Lady, please!
Where will l get my stuff?

Get out!

657
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:18,933

00:56:31,332 --> 00:56:34,635
Someone's taken them.
Now you take your pick

661
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,869
Rotation is routine
at temples

662
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,770
He took the payment,
didn't deliver

663
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,933
What's his name?

664
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,135
- They call Him God
- Real name?

665
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,033
No idea

666
00:57:06,699 --> 00:57:07,866
Where does he live?

667
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:10,633
ln that temple

668
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:14,636
- You handed him the cash?
- No. Put it in His box

669
00:57:14,699 --> 00:57:17,268
- Said he'd do the job?
- He says nothing

670
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:19,033
ls he mute?

671
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:20,900
Perhaps... maybe

672
00:57:21,532 --> 00:57:23,066
Oh...

Yes.
How do you all know?

Think l'm a jackass?
20 years a cop!

00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:17,835
God was crucified for your sins.
Ungrateful man!

691
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:22,402
Crucified! When?

692
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:26,036

Wine!
Now l got it!

701
00:59:48,699 --> 00:59:51,435
God was bored of

Now He preferr_ wine.
But wine was expensive

703
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:57,734
So l had to muster money

704
00:59:59,466 --> 01:00:03,970

Widow?

721
01:02:08,399 --> 01:02:10,400
Eveything is fine.

722
01:02:11,532 --> 01:02:13,467
Just relax. Smile.

723
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:17,502
So sory

01:02:17,566 --> 01:02:18,900

How do l know?
You are clad in white

726
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:24,267
Brides wear white!

727
01:02:24,332 --> 01:02:26,934
No, widows wear white

728
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:28,700
Widows wear black,
stupid!

729
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:31,902
Now don't
stress her out. Go!

730
01:02:41,899 --> 01:02:44,401
All three lost your husbands?

731
01:02:44,733 --> 01:02:46,935
l'm alive you moron!
Want a whack?

732
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,734
A_er many whacks,
l learnt

733
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,402
there wasn't one God.
There were many Gods

734
01:02:54,499 --> 01:02:56,801
Each with His own
set of rules

735
01:02:57,265 --> 01:02:59,533
Each God had noated
His own Company

736
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:02,200
They called it religion

737
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:05,635
Each Company had
its own agents

738
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:10,871
All Earthlings belonged to
some rgligion

739
01:03:11,332 --> 01:03:15,836
and Followed the God
of that religion alone

740
01:03:16,499 --> 01:03:20,202
What was my rgligion,
who was my God?

741
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:23,535
To find the remote
l had to know my God

742
01:03:39,366 --> 01:03:41,301
What are you doing?

743
01:03:41,532 --> 01:03:43,200
Where is the label?

744
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:45,234
What label?

745
01:03:45,699 --> 01:03:47,367
The Religion label

746
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:50,834
How do you know which
Company he belongs to?

747
01:03:51,466 --> 01:03:53,935
Where does God
Iabel them?

748
01:03:54,632 --> 01:03:55,599
Security!

749
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:05,634
finding my rgligion
was tough

750
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:11,136
So l decided to
worship all Gods

751
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:15,135
One oF them would be
my God, who'd help me

752
01:04:15,332 --> 01:04:21,638
lt's You who governs
The world l hear

753
01:04:22,132 --> 01:04:27,804
Do listen to my plea
My home beckons me

754
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:33,470
God where are You

755
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:40,837
Tell me where are You

756
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:48,638
You Quide back to sanity
Those who've lost their way

757
01:04:48,699 --> 01:04:54,771
l too am completely lost
Guide me too, l pray

758
01:04:55,265 --> 01:05:00,303
God where are You

759
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:07,638
Tell me where are You

760
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:38,368

762
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:48,170
Or to a Qurudwara
would You like me to Qo

763
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:55,405
Temples and churches,
l looked eveywhere

764
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:01,571
My hope now,
has turned to despair

765
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:07,503
My hope now,
has turned to despair

766
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:15,170
My hope now,
has turned to despair

767
01:06:19,299 --> 01:06:25,204
Not a single ritual
Did l ever nout

768
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:32,171
Like millions around

769
01:06:32,532 --> 01:06:37,503
God where are You

770
01:06:39,232 --> 01:06:44,303
Tell me where are You

771
01:07:12,632 --> 01:07:19,171
You have many names
And many Faces too

772
01:07:19,466 --> 01:07:25,538
l've walked each of the myriad
paths which lead to You

773
01:07:26,232 --> 01:07:32,371
ln no shrine did l Find You

774
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:38,071
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

775
01:07:39,566 --> 01:07:45,038

Your evey whim and Fancy
In more than ample measure

779
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:14,436
God where are you

780
01:08:16,499 --> 01:08:21,036
Tell me where are you

781
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:28,470

Tell me where are you

783
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:48,468
God - l'm all confused

784
01:08:50,299 --> 01:08:55,070
What's my fault?
Why can't my voice reach you?

785
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,134

head to the ground?

790
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:18,968
Do l wake you
with temple bells?

791
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:21,267
Or call out on a loudspeaker?

792
01:09:22,299 --> 01:09:27,804
The Geeta, the Quran,
the Bible - what do l read?

793
01:09:28,232 --> 01:09:32,235
Your different managers
say different things

794
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:37,370
Some insist fast on Monday,
others urge on Tuesday

795
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:42,803
Some forbid food after sunset,
some after sunrise

796
01:09:43,432 --> 01:09:47,369
Some say, worship the cow.
Others say slaughter her

797
01:09:48,099 --> 01:09:53,504
Some send me barefoot to the temple,
some wearing shoes to the church

798
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,802
What is right,

Both are centuries old.

Oh God, save me please...

01:14:04,165 --> 01:14:06,534
Dazzling light!

and invoked God

''God, enlighten me,''

What is this
miraculous object,

855
01:14:26,532 --> 01:14:29,701
that is warm
even in this biting cold?

856
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,533
God said,

857
01:14:31,566 --> 01:14:36,270
it's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's necklace

858
01:14:36,532 --> 01:14:42,271
Take it and enshrine it

Listen. You need to see
a psychiatrist

01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:28,270
Then go back to
the suicidal dog, Nikku

899
01:18:28,699 --> 01:18:31,301
That's the stoy for you

900
01:18:37,866 --> 01:18:41,569
l need to go back in
for 2 minutes

901
01:18:42,366 --> 01:18:45,535
Quit these enty - exits

902
01:18:45,933 --> 01:18:50,737
Another Rs 500,
he's all yours

903
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:54,603
When did l mention Nikku,
the suicidal dog?

904
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,634
You didn't

905
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,800
So how do you know?

906
01:18:59,265 --> 01:19:03,936
When you held my hands,
l read your thoughts

907
01:19:04,933 --> 01:19:06,701
You thought:
this stoy is dead

908
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:08,467
l got to live with the
Nikku stoy

909
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:11,602
Don't lie!
l must have mentioned it

910
01:19:11,733 --> 01:19:15,203
l cannot lie.
Lies need language

911
01:19:15,366 --> 01:19:18,836
On our planet
we hold hands, read minds

912
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:21,267
- Gimme your hand.
- No way

913
01:19:21,399 --> 01:19:23,601
- Ty it...
- Help me, son

914
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:29,205
My wife's ill. Hospital wants
a deposit of Rs 10,OOO

915
01:19:29,366 --> 01:19:33,570
l'm Rs 500 short.
If you can help...

916
01:19:33,699 --> 01:19:35,367
l'll give you

917
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:37,300
Here

918
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,201
Give your address.
l'll courier a check

919
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:43,368
Courier can't reach my home.
Please keep it

920
01:19:43,532 --> 01:19:45,267
Thank you

921
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,300
Sir...

922
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:50,835
Here's another Rs 100.
For the tip

923
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,234
Bless you

924
01:19:56,332 --> 01:20:00,235
Confirmed.
You are no mind reader

925
01:20:00,466 --> 01:20:05,537
You got conned.
There is no hospital around here

926
01:20:05,733 --> 01:20:07,201
l know!

927
01:20:07,299 --> 01:20:10,201
He's gifting his wife
a five star dinner

928
01:20:10,232 --> 01:20:12,367
lt's her 75th birthday

929
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:15,268
She'd never been
to a fancy place

930
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:18,301
He's been saving from
his pension for months

931
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:21,735
She ordered ice-cream
and his budget went kaput

932
01:20:21,833 --> 01:20:24,769
With a restroom excuse,
he ran out for some bucks

933
01:20:24,799 --> 01:20:26,367
Another yarn!

934
01:20:27,432 --> 01:20:30,635
On our planet, we don't lie

935
01:20:31,566 --> 01:20:33,367
Anyway, it's up to you

936
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:35,334
- Here.
- Thank you Sir

937
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:38,135
One moment. Tip him

938
01:21:38,299 --> 01:21:42,703
Why hold back -
it's your birthday!

939
01:21:42,866 --> 01:21:44,133
Thank you

940
01:22:13,065 --> 01:22:15,100
Address: Stepwell ruins

941
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:42,668
l told you.
On my planet, we don't lie

942
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,101
Hope you haven't told anyone...

943
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:56,067
.. that you're an alien?

944
01:22:56,265 --> 01:22:57,432
No way!

945
01:22:57,599 --> 01:23:02,370
They'd lock me in a lab,
and rip me up for research!

946
01:23:04,299 --> 01:23:07,135
How come you told me?

947
01:23:08,599 --> 01:23:10,300
Ever since
l set foot on this planet

948
01:23:10,499 --> 01:23:13,501
eveyone has taken
money from me

949
01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:17,202
You were the first to give it up
for me - dumping Rs 5,OOO in a box

950
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:21,369
l thought you are a good egg.
l could trust you

951
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:27,268
l'll get your remote back, Tipsy

952
01:23:28,466 --> 01:23:30,034
How?

953
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:34,436
l haven't figured it out yet,
but you'll go back home

954
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:37,168
That's my promise

955
01:24:24,497 --> 01:24:26,565
What are you goggling at?

956
01:24:26,998 --> 01:24:28,032
You

957
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:31,432
Aliens don't drop by eveyday

958
01:24:32,664 --> 01:24:36,801
Eveyone on your planet
has stick-out ears?

959
01:24:38,998 --> 01:24:40,532
Yup, ditto

960
01:24:40,597 --> 01:24:45,635
And they roam around naked?
Isn't it weird?

961
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,867
That crow is naked -
does he look weird?

962
01:24:50,097 --> 01:24:53,467
lf he dons a tie,
he'd look weird

963
01:24:55,497 --> 01:24:58,466
Tipsy, l was awake all night...

964
01:24:59,364 --> 01:25:02,467
.. thinking how to get
your remote back

965
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:03,997
Hello

966
01:25:04,364 --> 01:25:06,966
Connect to Balbir Singh.
Room No. 4

967
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:08,698
Wrong number

968
01:25:09,097 --> 01:25:10,798
lsn't this Fortis Hospital?

969
01:25:11,063 --> 01:25:13,965
Since yesterday you've been
dialing this wrong number

970
01:25:13,998 --> 01:25:18,068
lmpossible!
l can't be wrong evey time!

971
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,799
So how do we get
the remote?

972
01:25:24,998 --> 01:25:27,834
Connect to Balbir Singh.
Room No. 4

973
01:25:27,898 --> 01:25:30,900
Sory, Sir.
You've called too late

974
01:25:31,364 --> 01:25:33,032
Balbir died this morning

975
01:25:33,564 --> 01:25:37,668
Huh! How can a
piles surgey be fatal?

976
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,466
Embarrassing,
but don't wory

977
01:25:40,697 --> 01:25:42,832
Death Certificate
will say heart attack

978
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,998
so the family saves face

979
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:47,533
- Come for the body.
- On my way

980
01:25:47,831 --> 01:25:49,666
Ok, bye

981
01:25:52,531 --> 01:25:53,965
Why did you say that?

982
01:25:54,364 --> 01:25:55,698
Doling out joy

983
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:59,834
When he finds his friend alive,
imagine his joy!

984
01:25:59,898 --> 01:26:00,832
What!

985
01:26:00,964 --> 01:26:05,301
l was sick of his calls.
So l played a prank

986
01:26:05,764 --> 01:26:08,967
- A prank?
- Tipsy, l was just kidding!

987
01:26:15,898 --> 01:26:17,466
l got it!

988
01:26:18,464 --> 01:26:21,700
Someone is playing pranks

989
01:26:21,998 --> 01:26:24,567
When His Holiness dials God,

990
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:28,000
cocking his head,
'God, enlighten me',

991
01:26:28,397 --> 01:26:30,532
his calls are going
to a Wrong Number

992
01:26:30,898 --> 01:26:33,800
Someone out there
plays pranks

993
01:26:33,998 --> 01:26:38,035
The real God won't call
my remote a bead

994
01:26:39,464 --> 01:26:46,304
Looks like the phone lines
to God have gone kaput

995
01:26:46,531 --> 01:26:48,866
All calls to God are going
to a Wrong Number!

996
01:26:49,297 --> 01:26:50,598
As in?

997
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:55,001
Think - would the real God
give such weird solutions?

998
01:26:55,564 --> 01:26:59,434
Like - come rolling to me,
then l'll help you!

999
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:02,233
Aren't we God's children?

1000
01:27:02,397 --> 01:27:07,568
Would a father make his kids
roll for help?

1001
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:13,234
Your Dad ever said - kiddo,
want a new dress? Start rolling!

1002
01:27:13,898 --> 01:27:18,435
Another prank - bathe me
with cow's milk! What bull!

1003
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:24,937
And if these calls went to
the real God, what would He say?

1004
01:27:25,330 --> 01:27:29,934
He'd say - millions of my children
are starving on streets

1005
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:33,366
Give them milk.
Don't give me a lactose shower

1006
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:37,468
l'm sure someone's playing
pranks, like you just did

1007
01:27:37,898 --> 01:27:40,734
Tipsy thought His Holiness
was a victim of pranks

1008
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,932
l didn't clear his conFusion

1009
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:46,233
For a crazy idea was
forming in my head

1010
01:27:46,431 --> 01:27:50,301
An idea that would
get back Tipsy's remote

1011
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:52,431
Who's this Tipsy?

1012
01:27:52,931 --> 01:27:54,832
That's a mystey

1013
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:57,932
But the way he sees
this world is unique

1014
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:01,499
- As in?
- If he saw you smoking,

1015
01:28:01,764 --> 01:28:04,333
he'd call the cops to say
you're attempting suicide

1016
01:28:04,597 --> 01:28:05,297
Why?

1017
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:08,433
The pack says 'Smoking Kills'
yet you puff away

1018
01:28:09,798 --> 01:28:11,766
So what's the big idea?

1019
01:28:13,564 --> 01:28:14,831
Face-off

1020
01:28:15,297 --> 01:28:18,166
Between
Tipsy and His Holiness.

1021
01:28:18,497 --> 01:28:21,266
We'll take
the face-off to N

1022
01:28:21,731 --> 01:28:24,200
Ratings will go
through the roof!

1023
01:28:24,831 --> 01:28:27,667
l have three trident marks
on my right bum

1024
01:28:28,197 --> 01:28:30,732
You want three more on my
Ieft for balance?

1025
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:32,164
Don't wory

1026
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:37,302
Tipsy won't fight His Holiness
but gently explain, that...

1027
01:28:37,631 --> 01:28:40,667
.. his calls to God are going to
a Wrong Number

1028
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:44,199
His Holiness will be stumped

1029
01:28:44,697 --> 01:28:45,497
Chery!

1030
01:28:45,831 --> 01:28:49,367
Tipsy's here.
Just meet him once

1031
01:28:49,697 --> 01:28:52,232
l bet his queries
will baffle you

1032
01:28:52,497 --> 01:28:54,198
Trust me. Please!

1033
01:29:04,664 --> 01:29:06,565
Excuse me,
you dropped this

1034
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:08,132
Oh, thank you

1035
01:29:11,531 --> 01:29:13,699
That's not mine

1036
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,100
Kamasutra condoms,
strawbery flavor

1037
01:29:19,364 --> 01:29:22,366
l hate strawberries, man.
Ask these guys

1038
01:29:22,697 --> 01:29:25,199
lt's not mine.
Buzzed bozo!

1039
01:29:27,364 --> 01:29:29,566
- Ma'am, yours?
- How dare you!

1040
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:34,135
- Check your purse if it's missing.
- Shameless cad!

1041
01:29:35,097 --> 01:29:37,799
- Has to be yours.
- No, not mine

1042
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:39,798
Tipsy, it's his

1043
01:29:40,197 --> 01:29:44,601
Ask him all you want
to know about it. Come on in

1044
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:50,198
What's this?

1045
01:29:51,264 --> 01:29:52,765
lt's a condom

1046
01:29:53,164 --> 01:29:57,835
- What does it do?
- Controls the world's population

1047
01:29:58,464 --> 01:29:59,464
How?

1048
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:04,300
lt has to be worn
while having sex

1049
01:30:06,597 --> 01:30:09,733
How does your wearing it
control the world's population?

1050
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,199
Not just me...
millions wear it

1051
01:30:13,397 --> 01:30:15,365
They all borrow it from you?

1052
01:30:15,564 --> 01:30:17,432
No. Eveyone has it

1053
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:21,601
- l've a question
- Go on Tipsy, shoot

1054
01:30:22,030 --> 01:30:26,200
lf money is dropped,
all run for it

1055
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:31,568
lf a condom is dropped,
all run away from it. Why?

1056
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,465
Sex is a vey private matter

1057
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:36,065
Why?

1058
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:39,567
You don't tell the whole town -
l'm having sex today

1059
01:30:40,063 --> 01:30:45,067
But, then at weddings,
with fireworks and music bands

1060
01:30:45,097 --> 01:30:50,068
why do they tell the whole town -
l'm having sex today?

1061
01:30:52,164 --> 01:30:53,498
What's the matter?

1062
01:30:54,264 --> 01:30:59,235
l have no answer for you
but l have a job for you

1063
01:31:00,164 --> 01:31:01,632
Thank you!

1064
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:06,234
Let's beat it before
he changes his mind

1065
01:31:08,164 --> 01:31:10,599
Shield your holy bum,
Your Holiness

1066
01:31:10,964 --> 01:31:12,965
My trident is on its way

1067
01:31:16,697 --> 01:31:20,267
At this place His Holiness
connects his devotees to God

1068
01:31:20,397 --> 01:31:22,232
for solutions to their woes

1069
01:31:22,564 --> 01:31:25,433
Listen carefully to his calls

1070
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:32,004
lf you think the calls are going
to a Wrong Number, alert him

1071
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:35,966
- Will that get me my remote?
- Once he realises...

1072
01:31:36,030 --> 01:31:40,567
.. the bead stoy is a prank
he'll return your remote

1073
01:31:40,631 --> 01:31:43,700
Good plan. Let's go

1074
01:31:45,164 --> 01:31:48,233
To build a home for someone
is a holy deed

1075
01:31:48,297 --> 01:31:52,968
To build a home for God
is the holiest deed

1076
01:31:53,364 --> 01:31:56,066
So donate for the temple

1077
01:31:56,264 --> 01:31:59,066
And see
your woes flee

1078
01:31:59,898 --> 01:32:03,368
Son, voice your woe

1079
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,631
Your Holiness,

1080
01:32:06,364 --> 01:32:08,966
my wife's been paralyzed
for six months

1081
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:12,967
The doctors have given up.
What shall l...

1082
01:32:14,431 --> 01:32:16,065
God

1083
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:18,165
Enlighten me

1084
01:32:25,230 --> 01:32:26,564
Yes...

1085
01:32:29,998 --> 01:32:32,166
What place?

1086
01:32:36,998 --> 01:32:38,966
What transport?

1087
01:32:41,497 --> 01:32:43,932
Your wish is our command

1088
01:32:46,564 --> 01:32:49,199
Have you heard of
the Rathong glacier?

1089
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:50,465
No

1090
01:32:50,964 --> 01:32:55,368
lt's in the Himalayas.
Take a train to Silliguri

1091
01:32:56,197 --> 01:32:58,966
then a bus to Gangtok

1092
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:04,268
then an eight day trek

1093
01:33:04,898 --> 01:33:09,402
You'll reach a grand temple

1094
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:13,499
Pray there,
your problem will be solved

1095
01:33:13,831 --> 01:33:16,133
Wrong Number!
This is a Wrong Number!

1096
01:33:16,431 --> 01:33:18,299
- What?
- Wrong Number

1097
01:33:18,564 --> 01:33:24,002
Your Holiness, your phone line
to God has gone kaput

1098
01:33:24,831 --> 01:33:26,899
Your calls are going to
a Wrong Number

1099
01:33:27,097 --> 01:33:30,934
and a fake God is
playing pranks

1100
01:33:31,063 --> 01:33:34,266
What are you tying to say?

1101
01:33:34,531 --> 01:33:37,433
l'll explain.
Aren't we God's children?

1102
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:39,097
Yes, so?

1103
01:33:39,297 --> 01:33:43,034
Say your kid's in a jam
and comes to you

1104
01:33:43,364 --> 01:33:46,100
Will you help promptly,
or will you say

1105
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:49,499
kiddo, l've another house
2,OOO miles away

1106
01:33:49,831 --> 01:33:52,867
Come there, tell me
the same problem again

1107
01:33:53,063 --> 01:33:55,432
Then l'll solve it.
What bull!

1108
01:33:55,864 --> 01:34:01,069
lf the call went to real God, He'd
say: Son, tend to your ailing wife,

1109
01:34:01,397 --> 01:34:03,866
don't run after me

1110
01:34:04,063 --> 01:34:07,065
after death
you'll come to me anyway

1111
01:34:07,197 --> 01:34:10,900
give her your time now. Right?

1112
01:34:15,097 --> 01:34:17,532
l can prove it's a prank

1113
01:34:17,864 --> 01:34:21,100
Call this fake God
again and ask

1114
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:23,966
What's the guarantee
she will get well

1115
01:34:24,164 --> 01:34:28,234
Sir, till you get it in writing,
don't leave her side

1116
01:34:28,397 --> 01:34:31,366
Just call
and clear all _oubt

1117
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:35,566
lt's time for His Holiness'
holy silence

1118
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:46,439
Praise be to God
Gloy be to God

1119
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:54,101
This fake God is passing off
my property as a holy bead

1120
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:57,333
He's playing a prank

1121
01:34:58,831 --> 01:35:01,366
He is no God.
He is a fraud

1122
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:04,031
He is a FRAUD

1123
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:07,900
God doesn't talk
to us mortals

1124
01:35:08,464 --> 01:35:12,167
He communicates
through His managers

1125
01:35:12,764 --> 01:35:16,100
- Tipsy has raised a big question.
- What?

1126
01:35:17,497 --> 01:35:20,867
ls God really talking
to the managers?

1127
01:35:20,931 --> 01:35:21,831
No

1128
01:35:21,898 --> 01:35:26,102
So where do the commands
for us come from?

1129
01:35:26,397 --> 01:35:30,067
- From a Wrong Number!
- So what should the public do?

1130
01:35:30,264 --> 01:35:34,067
Till phone lines are fixed,
don't depend on God's managers

1131
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:36,832
Help each other
in difficult times

1132
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:44,203
A great tip from Tipsy:
Don't rely on God's managers

1133
01:35:44,397 --> 01:35:47,399
Rely on each other

1134
01:35:49,497 --> 01:35:53,334
Hail Lord Shiva

1135
01:35:54,764 --> 01:35:59,135
Tipsy says don't make the temple,
the bead belongs to him

1136
01:35:59,264 --> 01:36:01,332
What's in your pocket?

1137
01:36:03,864 --> 01:36:06,700
- Do you smoke?
- Yes

1138
01:36:06,864 --> 01:36:11,001
- You consume alcohol?
- Occasionally

1139
01:36:11,197 --> 01:36:14,400
You smoke cigarettes,
consume alcohol

1140
01:36:14,431 --> 01:36:18,134
despite knowing
their fatal effects

1141
01:36:18,998 --> 01:36:21,200
Governments
permit these poisons,

1142
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:26,902
factories manufacture them,
stores sell them

1143
01:36:26,998 --> 01:36:29,166
Nobody questions this

1144
01:36:29,397 --> 01:36:37,004
But in this sacred land of
Lord Ram and Krishna

1145
01:36:37,097 --> 01:36:39,833
if l wish to build a temple

1146
01:36:40,697 --> 01:36:42,398
why these questions?

1147
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:50,737
Why not question the man
who is tying to stall this temple?

1148
01:36:50,964 --> 01:36:52,699
Who's this Tipsy?

1149
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:55,131
What's his real name?

1150
01:36:56,397 --> 01:37:00,634
Why's he hiding it?
Is he a Muslim?

1151
01:37:01,230 --> 01:37:05,634
lf question you must,
go ask Tipsy

1152
01:37:05,664 --> 01:37:07,265
what is his religion?

1153
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:11,934
Find out his religion,
Find out his faith

1154
01:37:14,831 --> 01:37:17,800
Centuries ago,
Mohammad of Ghazni

1155
01:37:18,664 --> 01:37:20,699
came and destroyed
our temples

1156
01:37:21,164 --> 01:37:25,768
Today another invader
wants to repeat histoy

1157
01:37:25,931 --> 01:37:27,098
But we won't allow...

1158
01:37:53,998 --> 01:37:58,569
Your God asks my religion.
Let's ask Him...

1159
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:00,999
.. the religions of these people

1160
01:38:01,097 --> 01:38:05,568
- What nonsense?
- Call up your God!

1161
01:38:05,597 --> 01:38:10,034
Why bother God?
l'll tell you

1162
01:38:10,264 --> 01:38:12,165
This one is a Hindu.
He's a Christian...

1163
01:38:12,597 --> 01:38:14,198
.. Sikh, Jain and...

1164
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:17,232
.. that one is of your religion

1165
01:38:18,998 --> 01:38:21,700
Enlighten him

1166
01:38:22,097 --> 01:38:25,600
Hello. l'm Sikh

1167
01:38:25,831 --> 01:38:29,100
Gr_tings.
l'm Muslim

1168
01:38:29,564 --> 01:38:31,599
l'm Jain

1169
01:38:31,664 --> 01:38:34,033
Hi
l'm Christian

1170
01:38:34,664 --> 01:38:37,900
Hello! l'm Hindu

1171
01:38:38,564 --> 01:38:39,865
Bamboozled!

1172
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:43,867
l swapped their robes.
Get it?

1173
01:38:44,063 --> 01:38:46,064
Faith is connected
to fashion

1174
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:49,233
Want a demo?
Check the math

1175
01:38:49,898 --> 01:38:52,634
Beard + moustache + turban = Sikh

1176
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:55,732
Minus turban = Hindu

1177
01:38:55,898 --> 01:38:59,067
Minus moustache = Muslim!

1178
01:38:59,798 --> 01:39:02,800
This difference is
made by the fake God

1179
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:05,532
lf real God wanted it,
He'd put a label on us

1180
01:39:05,597 --> 01:39:08,599
- Is there a label on your body?
- Mine?

1181
01:39:08,664 --> 01:39:11,767
Don't gape, strip and check!

1182
01:39:12,063 --> 01:39:13,998
Why be coy?

1183
01:39:14,597 --> 01:39:19,501
Strip eveyone, show His Holiness.
Is there any label?

1184
01:39:19,798 --> 01:39:23,701
Cut the coyness.
OK, l'll go first

1185
01:39:26,063 --> 01:39:28,698
See the bare facts

1186
01:39:29,831 --> 01:39:34,735
ls there a label?

1187
01:39:35,564 --> 01:39:37,032
Nothing! You see!

1188
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:38,931
Check some more...

1189
01:39:39,531 --> 01:39:41,633
Remove this ruffian

1190
01:39:41,998 --> 01:39:45,101
Hey!
l'm proving a point

1191
01:39:45,197 --> 01:39:47,198
Start the chants!

1192
01:39:47,564 --> 01:39:50,066
Praise be to God
Gloy be to God

1193
01:39:50,197 --> 01:39:54,100
That's no divine bead

1194
01:40:01,998 --> 01:40:03,065
Jaggu!

1195
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,665
Stop this farce!

1196
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:07,030
Papa!

1197
01:40:09,464 --> 01:40:13,568
You were all of 40 days, when
His Holiness christened you

1198
01:40:13,697 --> 01:40:17,500
Remember, he who gives you
a name, can ruin it too

1199
01:40:18,063 --> 01:40:20,432
He named me
Jagat Janani

1200
01:40:20,664 --> 01:40:22,098
How can he ruin it further?

1201
01:40:22,497 --> 01:40:25,499
You!
Name your price

1202
01:40:25,731 --> 01:40:26,431
Papa!

1203
01:40:26,597 --> 01:40:29,466
Tying to scare His Holiness
to extort money

1204
01:40:29,631 --> 01:40:30,098
No, no

1205
01:40:30,531 --> 01:40:35,435
You'll burn in Hell!
Fear the wrath of God!

1206
01:40:40,497 --> 01:40:43,032
Thank you Papa!
Thank you

1207
01:40:43,864 --> 01:40:47,500
l'd solved only half the puzzle.
You pieced it together

1208
01:40:47,697 --> 01:40:49,432
Fear is the key

1209
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:54,936
The prankster is
cashing in on fear. Get it?

1210
01:40:55,531 --> 01:40:57,900
Not exactly,
but can you explain to Papa?

1211
01:40:57,998 --> 01:41:01,968
You bet! l can prove it.
Follow me

1212
01:41:03,364 --> 01:41:05,399
l don't have time
for this nonsense

1213
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:09,667
lf it turns out to be nonsense,
l'll call off the show

1214
01:41:22,497 --> 01:41:26,801
Exams are on at this college.
The students are scared stiff

1215
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:31,968
Now, we'll establish our business -
The Fear Factoy

1216
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:45,599
Machine installed

1217
01:41:50,631 --> 01:41:53,500
A little seed capital

1218
01:41:57,364 --> 01:42:00,834
Now the inauguration

1219
01:42:09,931 --> 01:42:14,835
Just watch!
Capital doubles in 15 minutes

1220
01:42:20,764 --> 01:42:22,332
Look there

1221
01:42:24,397 --> 01:42:25,931
The first customer!

1222
01:42:26,631 --> 01:42:29,900
Tea... piping hot tea

1223
01:42:30,397 --> 01:42:32,665
Check the investment
of the tea vendor

1224
01:42:32,964 --> 01:42:36,400
Kettle, tea, sugar, bike,
thermos

1225
01:42:36,731 --> 01:42:40,401
And here -
a rock and a red mark

1226
01:42:40,597 --> 01:42:42,398
Hot and piping tea...

1227
01:42:42,564 --> 01:42:44,732
There, you gotta
woo the clients

1228
01:42:44,964 --> 01:42:47,833
Here you shoo them away

1229
01:42:47,964 --> 01:42:52,335
Hey, scram.
Give others a chance

1230
01:42:54,831 --> 01:42:57,300
There you bow
before the customer

1231
01:42:57,397 --> 01:42:59,665
Here the customer
bows before you

1232
01:43:02,264 --> 01:43:06,334
lf he's in deep trouble,
he goes horizontal

1233
01:43:07,397 --> 01:43:11,768
The Wrong Number guy
trades in fear

1234
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:15,266
He knows - those in dread
to the temple head

1235
01:43:15,864 --> 01:43:18,800
You too seem afraid!
Off with these...

1236
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,665
Do not question religion

1237
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,465
lt's a matter of faith!

1238
01:43:25,664 --> 01:43:28,366
lf God didn't want us
to raise questions

1239
01:43:28,464 --> 01:43:32,501
He wouldn't give us
the power to reason

1240
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:36,701
Guardians of religion use violence
when they can't answer us

1241
01:43:36,864 --> 01:43:40,834
They scare us into silence.
But now we won't be silent

1242
01:43:41,264 --> 01:43:45,835
So far one Tipsy raised questions.
Now there'll be a thousand

1243
01:43:46,297 --> 01:43:48,766
Friends, pick up your phones

1244
01:43:49,230 --> 01:43:53,968
When you spot a Wrong Number,
shoot it and send it to us

1245
01:43:54,497 --> 01:43:56,699
We'll put it on N

1246
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:59,765
Dump your fear,
ask questions

1247
01:44:08,831 --> 01:44:10,766
Holy Sir!

1248
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,498
One question

1249
01:44:12,564 --> 01:44:14,866
lf you can conjure gold
from thin air

1250
01:44:15,264 --> 01:44:17,899
why don't you end
the nation's poverty?

1251
01:44:18,297 --> 01:44:20,232
Answer please

1252
01:44:20,831 --> 01:44:21,831
Holy Sir!

1253
01:44:21,898 --> 01:44:26,769
Since you're a walking gold mine,
why ask us for donations?

1254
01:44:29,297 --> 01:44:31,599
God is great!

1255
01:44:31,831 --> 01:44:34,233
This is a Wrong Number

1256
01:44:34,364 --> 01:44:37,800
- Jaggu... come with me
- Chery give me a moment

1257
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:41,933
Come with me

1258
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:43,965
The Wrong Number idea
is a national rage

1259
01:44:44,531 --> 01:44:47,867
- What!
- It's spread like wild fire

1260
01:44:53,397 --> 01:44:56,233
Guru says - to land a job,
feed a cow

1261
01:44:56,431 --> 01:44:59,801
ls this cow
an employment agent?

1262
01:45:00,164 --> 01:45:03,767
Or posts CVs on Monster.com?
Wrong Number

1263
01:45:03,864 --> 01:45:05,165
Watch this one!

1264
01:45:05,464 --> 01:45:08,266
He says, convert to
Christianity, or be damned

1265
01:45:08,597 --> 01:45:12,300
lf God wanted,
l'd be Christian by birth

1266
01:45:12,664 --> 01:45:15,867
Why convert now?
Wrong Number

1267
01:45:16,397 --> 01:45:18,265
These girls want to
go to school

1268
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:21,634
A new dictat says:
kill them if they do

1269
01:45:21,798 --> 01:45:26,469
ls God so small
He'll deny children kno_ledge?

1270
01:45:27,164 --> 01:45:28,665
Wrong Number

1271
01:45:29,297 --> 01:45:32,633
What God has destined for you
will happen

1272
01:45:33,164 --> 01:45:37,234
He has a master plan
for the Universe

1273
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:39,399
Accept it

1274
01:45:39,597 --> 01:45:44,201
Your disciples say:
to get a male child,

1275
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:48,734
buy this book,
and chant the mantras

1276
01:45:49,164 --> 01:45:52,600
So buy a Rs 10 book

1277
01:45:52,664 --> 01:45:56,501
and bust
God's master plan!

1278
01:46:04,697 --> 01:46:08,834
Tipsy! Your show's a hit!
Messages are pouring in

1279
01:46:09,164 --> 01:46:10,765
Here's one more

1280
01:46:15,731 --> 01:46:17,099
What happened?

1281
01:46:17,798 --> 01:46:21,768
lt's Papa. He's ashamed
l'm his daughter

1282
01:46:25,597 --> 01:46:28,299
l was in tenth grade

1283
01:46:29,497 --> 01:46:32,199
when l wrote my first poem

1284
01:46:32,764 --> 01:46:34,832
For Papa

1285
01:46:35,798 --> 01:46:41,303
They say my Mom l resemble.
l say possible,

1286
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:45,266
but l'm my Daddy's girl

1287
01:46:45,564 --> 01:46:48,099
l recited it
on the Annual Day

1288
01:46:48,564 --> 01:46:50,599
All parents clapped

1289
01:46:51,097 --> 01:46:55,100
but one whistled with joy

1290
01:46:56,230 --> 01:47:00,233
The applause ended,
the whistling continued

1291
01:47:01,197 --> 01:47:02,665
lt was Papa

1292
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:05,265
He was so proud of me

1293
01:47:06,631 --> 01:47:11,202
And now this message.
Ashamed of you

1294
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:17,069
There's a Wrong Number
in your Papa's head

1295
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:23,302
The day he gets rid of it,
he'll whistle for you again

1296
01:47:23,664 --> 01:47:25,399
lt won't happen

1297
01:47:26,063 --> 01:47:29,032
Don't be sad. Come with me

1298
01:47:29,063 --> 01:47:33,267
On my planet when people are sad,
know what they do?

1299
01:47:33,631 --> 01:47:35,132
What?

1300
01:47:35,364 --> 01:47:38,133
Recharge the battey!

1301
01:47:38,364 --> 01:47:41,166
- What!
- Just copy me

1302
01:47:46,297 --> 01:47:48,032
What are we doing?

1303
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:55,631
Shut your eyes!

1304
01:47:55,731 --> 01:47:57,466
How do l copy then?

1305
01:47:57,531 --> 01:47:59,432
Right.
Keep them open

1306
01:49:33,564 --> 01:49:36,566
To steal glances at you all day

1307
01:49:36,964 --> 01:49:39,599
To strain For evey word you say

1308
01:49:40,063 --> 01:49:42,999
To put evey chore aside

1309
01:49:43,264 --> 01:49:46,233
And Follow your evey stride

1310
01:49:46,397 --> 01:49:49,066
That's nothing but a
waste of time

1311
01:49:49,497 --> 01:49:52,333
Love is a waste oF time

1312
01:49:52,898 --> 01:49:55,333
Amorg is nothing morg

1313
01:49:55,898 --> 01:49:58,834
Love is a waste oF time

1314
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:02,232
But my mind and heart insist

1315
01:50:02,431 --> 01:50:05,267
Once in this liFe at least

1316
01:50:05,831 --> 01:50:08,099
l must waste my time

1317
01:50:08,431 --> 01:50:11,167

A zillion peeps into the mirror

A million times
l've styled my hair

1322
01:50:47,330 --> 01:50:52,468
Countless sets of
clothes l've tried

1323
01:50:53,831 --> 01:50:58,235
Emptied pe_ume
bottles with nair

1324
01:50:59,898 --> 01:51:05,770
Dressing up is all l did
Did nothing else worthwhile

1325
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:09,267
Now l understand

1326
01:51:09,497 --> 01:51:12,233

But my mind and heart insist

The donation box is getting
more questions than cash

1346
01:53:47,798 --> 01:53:52,702
Your relics don't sell anymore

1347
01:53:53,097 --> 01:53:57,201
Millions of abuses on
Facebook and Twitter

1348
01:53:58,764 --> 01:54:02,033
- Just five?
- Those are in support

1349
01:54:02,364 --> 01:54:04,332
The abuses are in here

1350
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:11,202
lt's time for action, Sir.
Avoiding the issue can be disastrous

1351
01:54:15,864 --> 01:54:17,365
Missing: God

1352
01:54:17,764 --> 01:54:19,165
Call Chery Bajwa

1353
01:54:19,864 --> 01:54:23,734
Tipsy has asked many questions.
l'll ask him just one

1354
01:54:23,898 --> 01:54:26,834
- Hey Jaggu
- What happened?

1355
01:54:27,798 --> 01:54:31,201
His Holiness wants to come
on the show. To debate with Tipsy

1356
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:34,099
- Tipsy'll rip him!

My pal's become a star!
Hey look, he's a rock star

1361
01:54:53,297 --> 01:54:57,067
Rock star was
roaming butt naked

1362
01:54:57,264 --> 01:55:02,569
l made him a star.
The bloke's on N

1363
01:55:02,998 --> 01:55:09,104
and me - in this shanty town,
this crappy shack

1364
01:55:09,564 --> 01:55:13,901
guzzling booze with
a jackass like you

1365
01:55:13,998 --> 01:55:16,166
Star my foot!

1366
01:55:32,197 --> 01:55:34,766
Tipsy, some
Bhairon Singh for you

1367
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:36,131
Bhairon!

1368
01:55:36,264 --> 01:55:38,099
Take that line

1369
01:55:39,564 --> 01:55:41,866
- Bro!
- You lusty lad

1370
01:55:42,063 --> 01:55:44,031
You're a rock star!

1371
01:55:44,164 --> 01:55:46,566
Bro, where are you?

1372
01:55:46,664 --> 01:55:49,767
ln Mandawa.
Coming to Delhi tomorrow

1373
01:55:49,998 --> 01:55:52,767
With a gift for you

1374
01:55:53,097 --> 01:55:57,501
l've nabbed the thief
who stole your stuff

1375
01:55:57,764 --> 01:56:00,733
He sold it for 40 grand

1376
01:56:01,230 --> 01:56:03,565
- Guess to whom.
- Whom?

1377
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:07,500
His Holiness!

1378
01:56:09,664 --> 01:56:16,637
God said: it's a divine bead
From Lord Shiva's necklace. Take it...

1379
01:56:17,063 --> 01:56:22,868
.. and enshrine it in a grand temple.
Sighting this bead...

1380
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:24,498
Hey,

1381
01:56:25,697 --> 01:56:27,865
what happened?

1382
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:32,033
The thief who stole
my remote is caught

1383
01:56:32,197 --> 01:56:33,698
What! Really?

1384
01:56:33,864 --> 01:56:39,202
Bro said, the thief sold it to
His Holiness

1385
01:56:39,497 --> 01:56:41,198
Then His Holiness is finished!

1386
01:56:41,931 --> 01:56:45,768
We'll tell him -
return the remote,

1387
01:56:46,030 --> 01:56:48,499
or the thief tells all on N

1388
01:56:49,097 --> 01:56:54,669
So he didn't find my remote
in the Himalayas! He's lying

1389
01:56:55,664 --> 01:56:59,768
Wrong Numbers are not
floated by some fake God...

1390
01:57:00,164 --> 01:57:02,533
.. but by His Holiness

1391
01:57:04,864 --> 01:57:07,132
You knew this Jaggu?

1392
01:57:07,431 --> 01:57:09,733
Remember the day
you mentioned Wrong Number

1393
01:57:09,998 --> 01:57:14,969
All his calls are going
to a WronQ Number

1394
01:57:15,164 --> 01:57:19,902
l knew then you were on the
wrong track. But l kept mum

1395
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:23,900
lf you'd called him a fraud,
people would have killed you

1396
01:57:24,063 --> 01:57:26,165
People crave for the unique

1397
01:57:26,497 --> 01:57:28,031
WronQ Number!

1398
01:57:28,431 --> 01:57:31,133
Your Wrong Number
concept was unique

1399
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:34,000
Today the world supports you

1400
01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:38,767
Tipsy, my plan worked!
You're going home!

1401
01:57:43,497 --> 01:57:46,867
You'll fly away tomorrow,
my friend

1402
01:57:47,097 --> 01:57:49,933
Whoosh... gone

1403
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:54,500
We'll never meet again

1404
01:57:55,964 --> 01:57:59,033
There will be such a void

1405
01:58:00,364 --> 01:58:02,999
l'll really miss you

1406
01:58:04,764 --> 01:58:06,832
Shall l stay back?

1407
01:58:09,697 --> 01:58:12,366
How can you?

1408
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:16,466
Simple,
l have a job

1409
01:58:16,931 --> 01:58:20,000
l'll get some ID made
and settle here

1410
01:58:20,497 --> 01:58:24,701
l'll find someone to
'waste time' with me

1411
01:58:25,364 --> 01:58:27,733
l'll mary her

1412
01:58:27,998 --> 01:58:30,734
- Who'll mary you!
- Why not?

1413
01:58:31,030 --> 01:58:35,567
Your wife will go nuts
introducing you -

1414
01:58:36,364 --> 01:58:39,900
Meet my husband.
He's Tipsy!

1415
01:58:40,864 --> 01:58:44,067
That's not my name!

1416
01:58:44,364 --> 01:58:46,966
- Tipsyyy!
- l'll get a real name

1417
01:58:48,364 --> 01:58:54,002
Why don't you suggest one?
A name you love

1418
01:58:54,764 --> 01:59:00,436
A man's name must
match his personality

1419
01:59:00,631 --> 01:59:02,299
Right!

1420
01:59:02,431 --> 01:59:04,933
So how is my personality?

1421
01:59:05,364 --> 01:59:07,299
l'll explain

1422
01:59:07,864 --> 01:59:10,533
A poet once wrote...

1423
01:59:12,297 --> 01:59:15,299
lrony of mismatched names...

1424
01:59:15,464 --> 01:59:18,733
No poety, please!
l've something to say

1425
01:59:19,397 --> 01:59:23,834
Who says
'What's in a name?'

1426
01:59:25,397 --> 01:59:29,033
lf you don't get the right one,
what a pain

1427
01:59:30,030 --> 01:59:33,967
Mr Burns is in fact so cool

1428
01:59:34,431 --> 01:59:37,300
With violence alone
Mr Peace does rule

1429
01:59:38,631 --> 01:59:44,303
His name is Mr Fox
But has no bushy tail

1430
01:59:45,297 --> 01:59:49,868
''l love you Jaggu''

1431
01:59:50,297 --> 01:59:54,300
One whole ton is the
weight of Mr flower

1432
01:59:54,764 --> 01:59:58,567
At his mere sight,
the poor chair does cower

1433
01:59:58,731 --> 02:00:00,432
Vey nice... vey nice

1434
02:00:00,664 --> 02:00:04,267
Here's a bunch of cards
with different names

1435
02:00:04,564 --> 02:00:07,934
Pick the one you like

1436
02:00:08,264 --> 02:00:10,799
Danduram Thatte?

1437
02:00:11,330 --> 02:00:13,732
- Disaster!
- Next!

1438
02:00:14,497 --> 02:00:16,265
Tutari Singh?

1439
02:00:16,564 --> 02:00:18,332
Phooey!

1440
02:00:19,397 --> 02:00:20,898
Sa_araz

1441
02:00:25,397 --> 02:00:27,932
- Sa_araz...
- What happened?

1442
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:30,999
Keep going,
find a good name

1443
02:00:34,464 --> 02:00:35,965
What's the matter?

1444
02:00:36,664 --> 02:00:38,332
Nothing

1445
02:01:30,697 --> 02:01:32,598
''l love you Jaggu''

1446
02:01:46,697 --> 02:01:48,465
Brother!

1447
02:02:21,097 --> 02:02:24,667
God is in His Heaven
We mo_als on Qround

1448
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:28,399
God is in His Heaven
We mo_als on Qround

1449
02:02:29,097 --> 02:02:33,100
Nowadays He doesn't have
Time to look around

1450
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:37,233
God is in His Heaven
We mo_als on Qround

1451
02:02:45,297 --> 02:02:48,733
Whatever may happen here
He does not reprimand

1452
02:02:49,230 --> 02:02:53,233
Thousand evils, million wrongs
He does not take a stand

1453
02:02:53,431 --> 02:02:57,701
Plundering is all around
Bombs come to hound

1454
02:03:45,297 --> 02:03:48,633
A terrorist ou_it has claimed
responsibility for the blast

1455
02:03:49,063 --> 02:03:52,199
They say this was
a mock drill

1456
02:03:52,664 --> 02:03:55,366
Persecute our people,
and real war will Follow

1457
02:03:55,664 --> 02:03:58,633
We shall protect our God

1458
02:04:20,063 --> 02:04:22,231
Where are you
going, Tipsy?

1459
02:04:23,063 --> 02:04:24,264
On the show

1460
02:04:24,531 --> 02:04:26,566
You don't have to

1461
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:31,465
l must.
More than ever

1462
02:04:46,063 --> 02:04:51,301
'The final Question'
Welcome to our special show

1463
02:04:51,497 --> 02:04:53,065
in which we meet Tipsy...

1464
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:55,165
Wait a minute

1465
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:02,965
Bring it

1466
02:05:08,431 --> 02:05:10,232
What is this?

1467
02:05:10,497 --> 02:05:15,168
God says: it's a divine bead
from His necklace

1468
02:05:15,431 --> 02:05:19,067
This man claims,
it's his property

1469
02:05:19,964 --> 02:05:23,300
God says: build a temple

1470
02:05:23,964 --> 02:05:27,334
And this man opposes it

1471
02:05:27,564 --> 02:05:33,036
Who do l listen to?
God, or this gentleman

1472
02:05:33,397 --> 02:05:39,169
who used to hand out these
blasphemous pamphlets?

1473
02:05:40,531 --> 02:05:43,567
First he claimed,
God is missing

1474
02:05:44,264 --> 02:05:46,232
Then said, God is a fraud

1475
02:05:46,464 --> 02:05:50,234
Next he'll say,
God is dead

1476
02:05:51,631 --> 02:05:57,169
What do you want, son?
A world without God?

1477
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:03,934
Do you have any clue
how people suffer?

1478
02:06:04,264 --> 02:06:06,532
No food to eat

1479
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:09,231
No place to live

1480
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:12,932
No friend to talk to

1481
02:06:13,397 --> 02:06:20,036
People kill themselves.
Slit their wrists, jump off buildings

1482
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:24,333
Why?
Because they have no hope

1483
02:06:24,898 --> 02:06:29,335
lf bowing before God,
smearing holy ash,

1484
02:06:30,097 --> 02:06:34,901
wearing amulets,
gives them hope to live,

1485
02:06:35,097 --> 02:06:39,901
then who are you
to snatch away that hope?

1486
02:06:40,364 --> 02:06:48,472
And if you snatch away their God,
how will you fill that void?

1487
02:06:49,397 --> 02:06:53,434
This man rants about
Wrong Numbers

1488
02:06:53,898 --> 02:06:59,570
Today he must tell us:
what is the Right Number?

1489
02:07:07,397 --> 02:07:10,466
You are right, Your Holiness

1490
02:07:11,230 --> 02:07:16,835
There was a time
l too had no food to eat

1491
02:07:17,464 --> 02:07:19,265
No place to live

1492
02:07:19,898 --> 02:07:24,969
l cried a lot
because l had no friend

1493
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:29,533
l had only one hope then -

1494
02:07:32,097 --> 02:07:33,932
God

1495
02:07:34,931 --> 02:07:38,067
Each day l hoped:
tomorrow will be better

1496
02:07:38,364 --> 02:07:41,166
God will find a solution

1497
02:07:42,964 --> 02:07:49,570
l agree
belief in God gives hope,

1498
02:07:50,998 --> 02:07:55,135
the strength to face ordeals

1499
02:07:56,264 --> 02:07:58,833
But l have one question

1500
02:08:01,831 --> 02:08:04,767
Which God shall l believe in?

1501
02:08:05,764 --> 02:08:09,000
You say there is ONE God

1502
02:08:09,931 --> 02:08:11,899
l say no

1503
02:08:12,898 --> 02:08:14,366
There are mO Gods

1504
02:08:15,931 --> 02:08:18,066
One who created us

1505
02:08:19,831 --> 02:08:23,467
And the other
whom you created

1506
02:08:24,397 --> 02:08:27,800
We know nothing about
the God who made us

1507
02:08:28,164 --> 02:08:32,935
But the God YOU made up,
is just like you

1508
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:37,834
Petty.
Takes bribes, makes false promises

1509
02:08:37,931 --> 02:08:41,968
Readily meets the rich,
keeps the poor waiting

1510
02:08:42,297 --> 02:08:45,767
Thrives on flattey.
Makes you live in fear

1511
02:08:47,798 --> 02:08:50,033
My Right Number is simple

1512
02:08:51,464 --> 02:08:56,168
J
The God who created us all
believe in Him

1513
02:08:57,731 --> 02:09:01,034
The God YOU created -

1514
02:09:01,964 --> 02:09:04,166
abolish him

1515
02:09:04,431 --> 02:09:05,899
Yes!

1516
02:09:06,297 --> 02:09:10,300
You'll abolish my God
and l'll keep quiet?

1517
02:09:10,764 --> 02:09:14,801
l know how to
protect my God

1518
02:09:14,964 --> 02:09:16,865
You will protect God?

1519
02:09:17,431 --> 02:09:19,332
You!

1520
02:09:19,731 --> 02:09:21,299
This is a puny planet

1521
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:24,932
Billions of bigger planets
float in space

1522
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:29,968
And you, sitting in a tiny corner of this
puny planet, have the nerve to say

1523
02:09:30,164 --> 02:09:33,867
you will protect Him,
who created the Universe?

1524
02:09:34,931 --> 02:09:39,702
He doesn't need your protection.
He can protect Himself

1525
02:09:43,164 --> 02:09:48,736
Today someone tried to
protect God and my friend died

1526
02:09:49,697 --> 02:09:52,332
This is all that's left -
his shoe

1527
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:55,298
Stop protecting God

1528
02:09:55,864 --> 02:09:59,234
Or this planet will have
no humans, only shoes

1529
02:09:59,664 --> 02:10:01,966
A Muslim terrorist
blows up a train

1530
02:10:02,864 --> 02:10:08,236
and a Hindu guru endures
your sermon. That's nice

1531
02:10:08,631 --> 02:10:13,402
What's this Hindu, Muslim?
Show me the label

1532
02:10:14,664 --> 02:10:17,333
You created these differences.
Not God

1533
02:10:18,097 --> 02:10:24,069
This is the deadliest
Wrong Number of this planet

1534
02:10:24,264 --> 02:10:27,000
lt kills people,
separates them

1535
02:10:27,364 --> 02:10:32,302
Like your Wrong Number
separated Jaggu from Sa_araz

1536
02:10:32,631 --> 02:10:38,636
- What Wrong Number?
- That Sa_araz will betray

1537
02:10:38,864 --> 02:10:41,299
He did betray her

1538
02:10:41,631 --> 02:10:45,935
- What's going on?
- Hold it

1539
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:55,138
You say my prediction
about Sa_araz was wrong?

1540
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:56,564
Exactly!

1541
02:10:56,631 --> 02:11:00,768
Then prove it -
prove my prophecy wrong!

1542
02:11:00,898 --> 02:11:05,302
Failing that,
fall at my feet and admit

1543
02:11:05,664 --> 02:11:09,601
that you are a liar.
You tried to defame me

1544
02:11:10,197 --> 02:11:12,265
What if l prove it?

1545
02:11:12,664 --> 02:11:14,298
Tipsy... don't!

1546
02:11:20,264 --> 02:11:21,999
Then this is yours

1547
02:11:28,030 --> 02:11:29,631
l accept

1548
02:11:30,063 --> 02:11:34,834
Turn the cameras towards
Jagat Janani

1549
02:11:40,998 --> 02:11:47,704
l hope you will answer
my questions truthfully

1550
02:11:50,097 --> 02:11:55,168
ln Belgium you fell in love
with a Pakistani boy

1551
02:11:56,631 --> 02:11:57,832
True or false?

1552
02:11:58,130 --> 02:12:00,532
Please spare my personal life

1553
02:12:00,664 --> 02:12:09,139
On Friday, at 3:21 pm
l predicted this boy will betray you

1554
02:12:09,597 --> 02:12:13,934
The next day you went to the
Marriage Registrar's office

1555
02:12:14,497 --> 02:12:16,165
but he didn't show up

1556
02:12:16,764 --> 02:12:19,133
True or false?

1557
02:12:19,230 --> 02:12:22,600
Yes, he didn't come.
Please stop this

1558
02:12:23,998 --> 02:12:30,137
Now will you come to my feet
or do l walk my feet to you?

1559
02:12:30,564 --> 02:12:34,501
- Sa_araz did not betray.
- Please let it go!

1560
02:12:34,564 --> 02:12:37,066
No. Tell us
what happened that day

1561
02:12:37,497 --> 02:12:38,764
Please!

1562
02:12:38,931 --> 02:12:42,567
Just once,
for my sake

1563
02:12:47,497 --> 02:12:50,533
l was at the Marriage
Registrar's office and

1564
02:12:50,831 --> 02:12:52,666
a letter was brought to me

1565
02:12:52,731 --> 02:12:54,966
Did Sa_araz bring it?

1566
02:12:56,831 --> 02:13:00,968
No.
He sent it through a kid

1567
02:13:01,164 --> 02:13:04,100
- Was it signed?
- No

1568
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:08,101
How do you know
Sa_araz sent it?

1569
02:13:11,164 --> 02:13:15,535
lt could have been
for some other girl

1570
02:13:18,063 --> 02:13:22,734
There was another girl.
With a cat, right?

1571
02:13:24,697 --> 02:13:28,667
She gave you the cat
to hold for a while

1572
02:13:29,631 --> 02:13:33,434
The kid who gave you the letter-
did he know you?

1573
02:13:33,564 --> 02:13:36,433
- No!
- Did you know him?

1574
02:13:36,831 --> 02:13:37,731
No

1575
02:13:37,831 --> 02:13:41,568
Then how would he know
the letter was for you?

1576
02:13:42,764 --> 02:13:49,470
Maybe he was told to give
the letter to the girl with the cat

1577
02:13:51,597 --> 02:13:58,003
You read the letter,
but didn't call Sa_araz

1578
02:13:58,597 --> 02:14:00,832
Did you?

1579
02:14:01,631 --> 02:14:08,771
Because this man planted
a Wrong Number - that Muslims betray

1580
02:14:09,097 --> 02:14:11,466
Sa_araz didn't betray you

1581
02:14:11,597 --> 02:14:12,864
What's going on?

1582
02:14:13,464 --> 02:14:18,435
You expect us to believe
these cat and bull stories?

1583
02:14:18,464 --> 02:14:19,698
One minute

1584
02:14:20,063 --> 02:14:24,133
We'll get to the truth right now.
Call Sa_araz

1585
02:14:24,464 --> 02:14:26,599
Hury up!

1586
02:14:28,697 --> 02:14:32,133
This number does not exist

1587
02:14:32,998 --> 02:14:36,434
Any other number?
Friend, college, something?

1588
02:14:36,631 --> 02:14:39,700
- C'mon Jaggu!
- Belgium University

1589
02:14:44,130 --> 02:14:45,965
- Hello.
- Hello!

1590
02:14:46,030 --> 02:14:50,067
l actually need to get in touch with
one of your grad students

1591
02:14:50,431 --> 02:14:51,899
Sa_araz Yousuf

02:15:32,097 --> 02:15:35,400
A student from Lahore

1607
02:15:35,597 --> 02:15:39,434
- Sa_araz Yousuf.
- Is your name Jaggu?

1608
02:15:42,030 --> 02:15:44,532
Hello... is your name Jaggu?

1609
02:15:44,964 --> 02:15:46,632
How do you know?

1610
02:15:46,998 --> 02:15:50,735
She's called!
The girl from Delhi has called

02:15:50,864 --> 02:15:52,599
Farah, it's Jaggu calling

1612
02:15:52,664 --> 02:15:56,300
Mr Sayyed, hury,

And with impeccable politeness
asks just one question:

1616
02:16:12,898 --> 02:16:17,702
Was there a call for me
from India - from Jaggu?

1617
02:16:17,931 --> 02:16:20,967
We say ''No'',
and he disconnects

1618
02:16:21,364 --> 02:16:23,299
He's driven us crazy

1619
02:16:23,497 --> 02:16:26,066
Wait.
l'll connect you to him

1620
02:16:41,464 --> 02:16:42,565
Hello...

1621
02:16:43,497 --> 02:16:46,700

Please sit down.
You're about to get a jolt

1626
02:17:06,431 --> 02:17:08,466
Pardon me?

Sa_araz...

1631
02:17:30,531 --> 02:17:32,266
Jaggu...

1632
02:17:34,264 --> 02:17:35,698
Hello...

1633
02:17:36,831 --> 02:17:39,967
.. hello Jaggu,
what's the matter?

1634
02:17:41,831 --> 02:17:44,300
Had you come to the
Marriage Registrar's office?

1635
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:48,233
l had,
but you had left

1636
02:17:48,931 --> 02:17:50,766
Why didn't you call?

1637
02:17:50,998 --> 02:17:56,336
l got your letter.
You'd said, 'Don't contact me'

1638
02:17:57,264 --> 02:17:59,733
l knew you were
under family pressure

1639
02:17:59,864 --> 02:18:06,370
But deep down l knew,
one day you would contact me

1640
02:18:08,731 --> 02:18:12,234
What took you so long?

1641
02:18:13,164 --> 02:18:17,401
l am sory.
l had your Wrong Number

1642
02:18:24,664 --> 02:18:29,268
Just got the right number
from a friend

1643
02:18:54,697 --> 02:18:56,398
Thank you son

1644
02:19:31,264 --> 02:19:33,132
Here, hold this

1645
02:19:57,230 --> 02:20:00,533
Tipsy! You're taking
batteries home?

1646
02:20:00,731 --> 02:20:05,502
- Don't get them there.
- So many! For what?

1647
02:20:05,731 --> 02:20:09,668
Back home, l'll listen
to the sounds l've recorded

1648
02:20:10,063 --> 02:20:11,330
What sounds?

1649
02:20:11,597 --> 02:20:16,101
Earth sounds -
crows, traffic honking

1650
02:20:16,230 --> 02:20:18,532
Up there, you'll listen
to cars honking?

1651
02:20:18,764 --> 02:20:23,702
Now and then -
when l miss this planet

1652
02:20:26,130 --> 02:20:29,566
Hey, wait!
There's one more bag

1653
02:20:29,664 --> 02:20:31,232
Forget it, Tipsy!

1654
02:20:31,297 --> 02:20:35,100
You kidding?
It's stuffed with batteries

1655
02:20:35,264 --> 02:20:37,633
Wait!

1656
02:20:40,631 --> 02:20:44,067
Driver... please stop!

1657
02:20:57,564 --> 02:21:01,367
Eveyone on your planet
has stick-out ears?

1658
02:21:02,564 --> 02:21:05,700
And they roam around naked?

1659
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:10,232
Why are you staring?
SomethinQ on my Face?

1660
02:21:14,364 --> 02:21:19,969
l was in tenth grade,
when l wrote my first poem,

1661
02:21:21,497 --> 02:21:23,332
For Papa

1662
02:21:24,397 --> 02:21:29,702
They say my Mom l resemble.
l say possible...

1663
02:21:37,197 --> 02:21:41,034
Poety means
sparse words, soaring thoughts

1664
02:21:43,497 --> 02:21:45,398
Pal, you're really cute

1665
02:21:47,197 --> 02:21:50,633
Here's to the
teetotalercalled Tipsy

1666
02:21:51,531 --> 02:21:55,401
Who says
''What's in a name?''

1667
02:21:56,531 --> 02:22:00,601
No tape had sounds of
crows or traFfic honkinQ

1668
02:22:01,364 --> 02:22:04,500
Evey tape had
just my voice

1669
02:22:12,197 --> 02:22:14,232
''l love you Jaggu''

1670
02:22:18,631 --> 02:22:20,332
Got it!

1671
02:22:25,631 --> 02:22:28,233
He sure made me run!

1672
02:22:31,431 --> 02:22:34,901
Tipsy, what's in these tapes?

1673
02:22:35,330 --> 02:22:38,433
Told you -
crows, traffic honking

1674
02:22:50,898 --> 02:22:55,168
Evey night, when your planet
rises, l'll play these tapes

1675
02:22:56,397 --> 02:23:02,002
And wave at you.
Like this

1676
02:23:04,130 --> 02:23:08,033
Will you wave back...
now and then?

1677
02:23:10,030 --> 02:23:12,999
Haven't you recorded my voice?

1678
02:23:13,364 --> 02:23:15,933
Your voice?

1679
02:23:16,264 --> 02:23:20,434
l think l have...
that one poem you recited

1680
02:23:21,531 --> 02:23:24,333
One poem? That's it?

1681
02:23:27,364 --> 02:23:29,966
l'm not exactly
in love with you...

1682
02:23:30,330 --> 02:23:33,366
.. to waste all my time
over you!

1683
02:23:52,264 --> 02:23:55,467
He didn't look back.
Not once

1684
02:23:55,864 --> 02:23:58,032
He was hiding his tears

1685
02:23:58,931 --> 02:24:03,902
One thing he learnt from us.
One thing he taught us

1686
02:24:04,264 --> 02:24:06,899
He learnt From us
how to lie...

1687
02:24:07,264 --> 02:24:11,434
.. and taught us
how to love

1688
02:24:12,364 --> 02:24:15,366
He loved me enough
to let me go

1689
02:24:16,030 --> 02:24:21,335
He came here naked.
As children do

1690
02:24:22,464 --> 02:24:28,303
Asked a lot of questions.
As children do

1691
02:24:30,431 --> 02:24:33,534
And then one day...

1692
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:38,133
.. he went away

1693
02:24:38,964 --> 02:24:43,401
Four billion miles away

1694
02:24:44,831 --> 02:24:48,968
He left me two parting gifts

1695
02:24:50,831 --> 02:24:53,066
Sa_araz

1696
02:24:53,864 --> 02:24:56,766
and Papa

1697
02:24:58,864 --> 02:25:06,037
Till l live... evey night l'll look
at his planet and wave

1698
02:25:08,063 --> 02:25:12,901
l'm sure,
he'll do the same

1699
02:25:15,831 --> 02:25:18,867
l miss him

1700
02:25:57,431 --> 02:26:01,835
Fellow astronauts,
prepare to land on Ea_h

1701
02:26:01,898 --> 02:26:05,968
Remember the Four
Ea_h Su_ival Commandments

1702
02:26:06,197 --> 02:26:09,066
One:
Do not roam around naked

1703
02:26:09,364 --> 02:26:14,869
Cuddling, making love etc.
must be done in closed rooms

1704
02:26:14,998 --> 02:26:18,935
But fighting, making war etc.
is allowed in the open

1705
02:26:19,230 --> 02:26:22,967
Two: Beware of language,
it's confusing

1706
02:26:23,030 --> 02:26:26,867
lf Earthlings say,
'l love chicken and fish,'

1707
02:26:27,030 --> 02:26:30,700
it doesn't mean
they love animals,

1708
02:26:30,931 --> 02:26:35,268
but that animals are
on the lunch menu

1709
02:26:35,697 --> 02:26:40,334
The gap bemeen thought and
speech is our topic oF research

1710
02:26:40,964 --> 02:26:44,701
Thr_: On landing,
Find dancinQ cars For clothes

1711
02:26:44,764 --> 02:26:51,937
Hide your remotes deep in your
underwear, safe from thieves

1712
02:26:52,164 --> 02:26:55,267
four: the mother commandment

1713
02:26:55,330 --> 02:26:59,801
lf anyone says:
l'll connect you to God,

1714
02:26:59,964 --> 02:27:04,335
dump the research, take a U-turn
and run For your liFe

1715
02:27:16,898 --> 02:27:19,700
Come, don't be afraid

1716
02:27:24,831 --> 02:27:27,633
What are you goggling at?

1717
02:27:28,230 --> 02:27:31,032
- l have a question.
- What?

1718
02:27:32,130 --> 02:27:36,901
On your last visit,
how often were you whacked?

1719
02:27:44,831 --> 02:27:47,633
- What's this?
- Self-defense!

1720
02:27:47,898 --> 02:27:50,000
Safety gadgets?

1721
02:27:50,230 --> 02:27:53,700
- Let's go.
- Not there! This way

1722
02:27:53,831 --> 02:27:54,898
Kaput!
