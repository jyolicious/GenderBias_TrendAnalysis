1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,760
'The producer, the director, the artist,

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,720
'or any other person associated
with the film do not intend'

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,000
'to hurt or disrespect any person,
place, region, country, religion,'

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,240
'community or religious sentiments.'

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,480
'The filmmaker respects the perspectives
and viewpoints of others.'

6
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,840
"O, Sweetheart... "

7
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,240
"This time when I come home, "

8
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,920
"I'll buy you a motorcycle."

9
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,080
"I'll make you wear the helmet
and hop on the back seat"

10
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,760
"and race my motorcycle ahead."

11
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,760
"O, Sweetheart...

12
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,200
"My dear sweetheart."

13
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,640
"O darling,
don't hold on too hard."

14
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,120
"Imagine what the
platoon will say."

15
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,480
"This time if I get promoted,"

16
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,960
"I'll buy a car for you instead."

17
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
Get back.

18
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,680
Get back.

19
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's go... Let's go.

20
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,400
Sartaj.

21
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,160
Sir.

22
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,320
Kailang.

23
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
Kailang accompanied by Ebohal.

24
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,200
Along with 70-80 terrorists of KYKL...

25
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,960
Double of what we had expected.

26
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,400
Sir, shall we radio-in the B-team?

27
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,880
Negative.

28
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,680
They won't get here before dawn.

29
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,560
We'll lose the element of surprise.

30
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,680
We might not get
this opportunity again...

31
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,720
when all the terrorists of Nagaland
and Manipur have assembled in one place.

32
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,720
Karan.

33
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,960
Form an outer perimeter
with 10 commandos.

34
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
Mainly snipers.

35
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,680
Sartaj, the other commandos and I, will
move in from the left and right flank...

36
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,200
for a direct assault.

37
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,200
You will handle any terrorist
who gets out of our circle.

38
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,600
No terrorist gets out alive.

39
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
Copy.
- Copy.

40
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,160
Copy.
- Good. Best of luck.

41
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,480
Best of luck.

42
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
Sartaj.

43
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,360
Anyone spot Kailang?

44
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,480
Negative Sir.

45
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,440
Commandos!
- Yes, sir!

46
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,880
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!

47
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,360
I said how is the spirit?
- High, sir!

48
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,840
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!

49
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,440
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!

50
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
What is Major Vihaan's background?

51
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,800
He's an NDA Topper.

52
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,480
Para-Commando Gold Medallist.

53
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,240
His father; Col. Meher Singh Shergill.

54
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,480
Was martyred in the Kargil war,
in Tololing.

55
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,760
Posthumous, he was
honoured with the Mahavir Chakra.

56
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,960
After being trained
for the Special Forces...

57
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Vihaan was posted in Kashmir,
Jaisalmer, and Manipur.

58
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,840
He was also responsible for the on-ground
planning of the North-Eastern mission.

59
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Boys!

60
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,880
Major Vihaan Shergill.
- Fantastic.

61
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,120
He headed this operation, sir.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

62
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,240
Donor to meet you too, sir.

63
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,800
Major Karan.
- Very proud of you, officer.

64
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
Thank you, sir.
- Well done.

65
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
Capt. Sartaj.
- Sartaj.

66
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,800
Thank you, sir.

67
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,000
Your team's bravery and skill...

68
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,200
has put a stop on the movements
of the North Eastern Terrorism.

69
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
We're very proud of you.

70
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,160
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

71
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,840
We just received a word from RAW...

72
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
that the remaining terrorist groups
want to compromise with us.

73
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,320
After the Special Forces mission,

74
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,080
they have no choice
but to compromise with us.

75
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,040
Vihaan.

76
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,600
General. Arjun mentioned that
you've put in a request for...

77
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,960
pre-mature retirement
on compassionate grounds.

78
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
Why? What's wrong?

79
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,760
Sir...

80
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,920
my mother has Alzheimer's.

81
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,880
Stage 6.

82
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,760
Her memory is fading by the day.

83
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,960
And, she hasn't been
keeping well either.

84
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,880
I've been posted
in the Eastern Command,

85
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,640
and she lives here
in Delhi with my sister.

86
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,800
I would like to spend some time
with her before she forgets me too.

87
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Bravo.

88
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,200
You're a good son who wants
to take care of his mother.

89
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,280
But it's also important to
take care of your country.

90
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,040
After all, this country
is also our mother.

91
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,880
Isn't there a
way other than retirement?

92
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,360
There is.

93
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,880
What if we transfer you
to the Army Headquarters in Delhi?

94
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,520
You'll stay close to your mother,
and us too.

95
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,120
What say?

96
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,920
Right, sir.

97
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,200
Great.

98
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,360
Mr. Govind.
- Sir.

99
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,560
Arrange a nurse for his mother
who will stay with her 24 hours.

100
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,600
Sure.

101
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,440
Well...

102
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,560
Why don't you all
start with dinner..

103
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,080
Everyone must be hungry.

104
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Doesn't matter how many times you
read that report,

105
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
nothing will change.

106
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,960
I have just one request.

107
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
When I get very sick,

108
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,240
don't dump me in some hospital.

109
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,400
Mom, no one's taking
you to any hospital.

110
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,320
I feel very afraid when I am alone.

111
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,440
Take your pills.

112
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,600
Here you go.

113
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Take it.
- Neha's promised me...

114
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Mom...

115
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,200
I am trying my best.

116
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,840
I swear.
- I know.

117
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,640
I know you're trying your best.

118
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,360
Mom, take your pills.

119
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
May I?

120
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,720
Hi, uncle.

121
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,120
What took you so long to open the door?
- Sorry.

122
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,360
These are all of mom's clothes.

123
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,760
The only thing left
now are the books.

124
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,480
I will bring them over later. Okay.

125
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
Oh yes, her medicine.

126
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,560
Did you give her the medicines?
- Just did.

127
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,200
Where is she?
- Inside.

128
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,160
Okay.

129
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Uncle?

130
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,480
At what age did
you get a black belt?

131
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,240
16.

132
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,240
See this?

133
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,200
It's a Green belt.

134
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,040
I'll get my black belt
in a couple of years.

135
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,480
Then you better
be careful around me.

136
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,800
And don't make me lose my temper.

137
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,640
So what are your plans after
getting the black belt, Ms. Karate?

138
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,520
Firstly,
I'll join the army like uncle.

139
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,120
And then become India's
First Female Army General.

140
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,040
Bravo.

141
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,560
Uncle's sycophant!

142
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,720
Because your father's a clown,
isn't he?

143
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,480
You don't think he's
an officer, do you?

144
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,720
Suhana, go get the scissors.

145
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
Scissors.

146
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,000
Vihaan, please go help Karan.
- Why?

147
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,680
He's made a real mess
planning your party.

148
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Oh, God.

149
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,200
Our home looks like a
couple of grenades went off.

150
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Seriously.

151
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,360
Scissors.
- Thank you.

152
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's go meet your papa.
- Come on.

153
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,520
Mom's nurse will be arriving soon.

154
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,640
The guest room is ready for her...

155
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Vihaan.
- Yes, mom.

156
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,800
When did you arrive?

157
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,840
He just arrived today, mom.

158
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,440
He wanted to surprise you.

159
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,840
How long are you planning to stay?

160
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,840
10 days.

161
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,440
He's planning to take
you to aunt Rajni's house.

162
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,920
In Dehradun.

163
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,160
You better leave.
Karan's waiting for you, okay.

164
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,880
Mom, did you watch
your favourite show?

165
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,040
Suhana, go finish your homework.

166
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,920
Did you eat?

167
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
I am really famished. Let's eat.

168
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,600
Uncle. Let's go.

169
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,120
Uncle, Papa taught me
your battalion's war cry.

170
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Really? Tell me.

171
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,480
Courage and competence in war,

172
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,200
sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.

173
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,720
Come on... You call that a war cry?

174
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,800
When you shout out a war cry...

175
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,440
it should make the
soldier's blood boil.

176
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,120
And your enemies should
shiver in their boots.

177
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
That's a war cry.

178
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,920
And start eating
eggs for breakfast.

179
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,760
No more salads like your mom!

180
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Get changed,
And then we can do your homework.

181
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,600
Go.
- Okay.

182
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,240
Sartaj?

183
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,200
Didn't you have a date today?

184
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,440
Why didn't you go?

185
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,880
You didn't hear?

186
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
What happened?

187
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,440
He got all dressed up,

188
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,080
wore Armani perfume...

189
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,800
and was about to leave when he suddenly
gets a message from his girlfriend.

190
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,560
Saying "I am tired of
this relationship, its over."

191
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
I am really sorry, I didn't know.

192
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
I am not finished yet.

193
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,680
A little later she
messaged him again.

194
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
Saying "Sorry sweetheart, this
message got sent to you by mistake."

195
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,680
These uptown girls I tell you...

196
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,160
uptown...

197
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,160
But anyway...

198
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,440
How are you going to
manage staff work in Delhi?

199
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,480
A man like you will go
crazy pushing pen in South Block.

200
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,040
Your planning has never failed
in any of the missions.

201
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,040
Sir, you're needed at the border,
not in Delhi.

202
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,080
Look, every soldier
has to this job as well.

203
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,960
And, you both know
that I have to do this.

204
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,120
Now stop making these sad faces
and pass me the cottage cheese.

205
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,960
Did mom's reports come in?
- They did.

206
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,360
It's spreading aggressively now.

207
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,480
Hope you are having a good time.

208
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,120
Please help yourself, guys.
- Karan.

209
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,400
Here's your drink.
- Thank you.

210
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,080
Cheers.
- Cheers.

211
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,760
This is nothing, Capt. Zeeshan.

212
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,280
Vihaan's dad in fact brewed
the best brandy in the world.

213
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,640
And often after returning from school
we would help ourselves to it..

214
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,800
Soon he found
out and suspected us.

215
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,320
So, in order to save
ourselves from the beating...

216
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,560
we transferred half of the
brandy to our school water bottle.

217
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,360
And, we passed urine in the half empty
brandy bottle to make it look full.

218
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,720
Not us, just him.

219
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,640
And unfortunately, the very same night,
his Titu uncle flew in from abroad.

220
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,480
To try the latest batch of brandy.

221
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,960
He took one sip and, Listen. Listen.

222
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,040
He took one sip and said...

223
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,280
"Exquisite!"

224
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,840
Hello, sir.

225
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,400
When did she fall asleep?
- A little while ago.

226
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,080
Did she take her pills?
- Yes, sir.

227
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,520
She has a habit of waking
up in the middle of the night.

228
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,280
If you need anything,
feel free to tell me.

229
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,760
I'll be right here.
- Yes, sir.

230
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,560
Don't worry, sir. It's my job.

231
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,520
And, in case you want to rest,
there's the guest room.

232
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,360
No problem, sir. I am fine.

233
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,920
Thank you.

234
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,640
What is your name?
- Jasmine.

235
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,480
Jasmine?
- Jasmine Almeida.

236
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Jasmine Almeida. Sit.

237
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
Sit.

238
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,160
Stop spreading these
lies immediately!

239
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,240
You've turned this into a joke.

240
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
Everyone knows that
we're a peace-loving nation.

241
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,640
You blame us for every
trivial attack in your country.

242
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,960
I want evidence!

243
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,920
Evidence!?

244
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,160
What more proof do you need, sir?

245
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,720
What you're saying is baseless.
Absolutely baseless.

246
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,960
Three terrorists infiltrated
our border through the Ravi river.

247
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
They opened fire on
a Punjab Roadways bus.

248
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
Some were injured...

249
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,920
But the driver kept his head
straight and didn't stop the bus...

250
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,600
and drove straight
to the Government Hospital.

251
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,760
Where are the terrorists now?

252
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,400
Right now they are hiding in
an under-construction building...

253
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,640
near Dina Nagar Police Station.

254
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,320
But the Swat Team have
already started their operation.

255
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,960
Keep NSG on standby.
- Okay, sir.

256
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,320
Which terrorist group
do they belong to?

257
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,160
According to our sources,
these men are from Lashkar.

258
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,760
Do we know how many
people have died?

259
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,120
Four civilians are dead.

260
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,120
And 11 are still serious.

261
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,560
Sir. IEDs were discovered
at the Pathankot Railway tracks.

262
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
There's a probability
of finding more.

263
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,120
Sir...

264
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,680
Please excuse me.

265
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,440
Sir.

266
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,360
The Punjab Swat Team
has arrived on the spot.

267
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,440
IEDs were recovered from railway
tracks between Pathankot and Amritsar.

268
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,120
Sorry, sir.

269
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,880
We're doing our best.

270
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,880
Yes, sir.

271
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,440
"O Life..."

272
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,520
"Why was there was
always a rift between us?"

273
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,760
"O Life..."

274
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,160
"Together we took care
of all the complaints we had."

275
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,200
"O Life..."

276
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,080
"Why was there
always a rift between us?"

277
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,520
"O Life..."

278
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:39,600
"Together we took care
of all the complaints we had."

279
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,200
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

280
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,080
"now you must try following me."

281
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,240
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

282
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,400
"now you must try following me."

283
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,320
"And away I go... Away I go..."

284
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,440
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

285
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,720
"And away I go... Away I go..."

286
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,680
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

287
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,880
"A part of me is still here..."

288
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,160
"and other part
is somewhere else."

289
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,160
"We've met countless times before."

290
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,840
"Yet every time we meet
you feel like a stranger."

291
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,480
"My destination is right here..."

292
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,200
"yet my path seems complicated."

293
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,800
"No matter how many times
I try to walk towards you..."

294
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,600
"but the distance
never seems closer."

295
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,240
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

296
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,840
"now you must try following me."

297
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,120
"I always walked down the path
you showed me..."

298
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,320
"now you must try following me."

299
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,320
"And away I go... Away I go..."

300
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,280
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

301
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,720
"And away I go... Away I go..."

302
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,520
"In which direction do you go,
o traveller?"

303
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,360
"A part of me is still here..."

304
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,880
"and other part
is somewhere else."

305
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,920
"A part of me is still here..."

306
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,160
"and other part
is somewhere else."

307
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,960
"O Life..."

308
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,280
It's been more than 16 hours now

309
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,320
and yet there seems
no respite from this encounter.

310
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,600
The ADI building is being targeted
by rocket launchers and grenades.

311
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,240
And Fire has broken out
in one part of the building.

312
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,560
We've learned from our sources that

313
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,560
two soldiers have been injured...

314
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,640
although we have
no confirmed information.

315
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,400
And the sound of the explosions...

316
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,120
Jai Hind, sir.

317
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,480
Why are you here?

318
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,680
Sir, my case is
under investigation.

319
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,400
My first posting was
in Srinagar in July 2014.

320
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,920
I was just getting
to know my work when...

321
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,520
there was a huge deluge
in the first week of September...

322
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,280
and the dam on Jhelum broke.

323
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,600
Water started to
rise at an alarming rate...

324
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,320
in the low lying
areas of Srinagar.

325
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,360
All the MI-17 and Dhruv
pilots immediately...

326
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,120
engaged in a sortie mission.

327
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,360
Without any rest or food, we started
rescuing people from low lying areas.

328
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
On the 7th night at 3 am, we
received a distress call from Rajbagh.

329
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,560
A 7-year-old child
was badly injured...

330
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,640
and stuck on the roof
of her house along with her mother.

331
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,560
There was almost no visibility
due to the rain.

332
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,960
As a result, the Commander cancelled
all rescue missions till dawn.

333
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,920
But somehow I couldn't
get that child out of my head.

334
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,520
I had to do something.

335
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,600
Sabiya and Zooni.

336
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,240
Is anyone from your family
in the Defence forces?

337
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,080
Dad? Mom? Brother?

338
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,000
No, sir.

339
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
My husband was.

340
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,440
Capt. Jaskirat Singh Rangi.

341
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,000
Seasoned Punjab Regiment.

342
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,080
He died in an ambush
at the Naushera Sector.

343
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,680
Jaskirat was a big patriot.

344
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,480
The only thing I
am afraid of now is...

345
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,800
whether I'll ever get to prove
my patriotism to Jaskirat or not...

346
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,880
Mom.

347
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,920
Mom.

348
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,200
Mom.

349
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,800
Mom.

350
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,360
Jasmine.

351
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,840
Yes. Yes.

352
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,800
How's your acidity now?

353
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,800
Are you taking your pills on time?

354
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,280
Okay, I am going to call you back.

355
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,320
Where's mom?
- Inside. Sleeping.

356
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,160
Stay here.

357
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,440
Peaceful-Peacefuller.

358
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,640
More peaceful.

359
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,840
Most Peaceful...
- Neha, did mom come here?

360
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
No.

361
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,600
Oh, God.
- Mom.

362
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,440
I am extremely sorry.

363
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,920
I am sorry.

364
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,200
It was very urgent.

365
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
I wouldn't have if
it wasn't an emergency,

366
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,440
You know me.
I would have never taken that call.

367
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,080
I am extremely...
- I know...

368
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,480
What is your real name?

369
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,200
Jasmine Almeida...
- What is your real name, Jasmine?

370
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,280
Sir, I just told you.

371
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,320
Where's my mom?
- Vihaan...

372
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,920
Relax.
- One second, Neha. One second.

373
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,360
I don't...
- Now you listen to me.

374
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,400
Neither my family, nor
I need protection of any kind.

375
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
I am quite capable of
protecting them &amp; myself!

376
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,440
And I definitely don't need an
incompetent and fake nurse like you.

377
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,720
So tell your Intelligence
Department...

378
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,560
to find my mom
by hook or by crook,

379
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,640
and bring her home.

380
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,640
Do it!

381
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,720
Can I take it?
- Yes, you can.

382
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,320
Hello.

383
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,920
Where?

384
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Okay.

385
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,760
Our agents found Mrs. Suhasini
under the Dwarka bridge.

386
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,160
The day I came here I put
GPS tags on all her clothes...

387
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,120
so that we can track
her every movement.

388
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,680
She should be home soon.

389
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,320
I might be an incompetent nurse,
But I am a damn good agent, sir.

390
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,800
I am sorry.

391
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,320
She should be home soon.

392
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,520
Jai Hind, sir.

393
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,840
Jai Hind.
- There's still time for breakfast.

394
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,120
Can we get tea?

395
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Shaqeel.

396
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,680
Shaqeel.

397
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,320
Shaqeel.

398
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
Let's go there.

399
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,400
That side. Run.

400
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,640
Go on. Go.

401
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,160
They are heavily armed.

402
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,640
Around 4-5 terrorists.

403
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,040
Sir.
- What position?

404
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,400
Two are behind the West Wing.

405
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,440
Major Awasthi's team
has opened counter-fire.

406
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,600
One of them is
on the Admin block...

407
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,160
and the other near the T6 wall.

408
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,040
Sartaj.
- Sir.

409
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,920
Fetch me my Draganov
from the Transit room.

410
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,800
I'll blow their bloody
brains out from right here.

411
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,880
Hurry.

412
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,640
Rohit. Thapa.

413
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,800
Yes sir.
- Sir.

414
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,800
Cover me.

415
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,680
Sartaj, Go through the West Wing
and reach at the fuel depot.

416
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
And you two rendezvous
near the T6 bunker.

417
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,600
Sir.
- Best of luck, guys.

418
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,600
Go. Go. Go.
- Yes, sir.

419
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,480
Stop! Stop!

420
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,800
Stop firing!
- Stop firing!

421
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,640
Courage and competence in war.

422
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,640
Sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.

423
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,960
Sacrifice is the ultimate Dharma.

424
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,120
This is no time to think
about the UN or USA's opinion.

425
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:55,480
It's time we send a message to Pakistan
in the language they understand.

426
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,200
If we don't give a fitting
reply for this cowardly attack...

427
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,480
then it will shatter the morale
of our army and our civilians.

428
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,960
People will lose
faith in our government.

429
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,840
Sir, we can prepare
for war in three days.

430
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,600
I can send our tanks and heavy
artillery under 8 hours to the LC.

431
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,760
I think we should
dishonour the Indus Treaty.

432
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,400
If ISI gets pressurized
by Pakistani citizens

433
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,800
then maybe they will
lessen their terrorist attacks.

434
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,280
Pakistan is under the ISI.

435
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,880
The ISI is not under Pakistan.

436
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,400
They might let their
people starve to death...

437
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,880
But never stop funding terrorism.

438
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,800
We must think of a better option.

439
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,040
Govind.

440
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,160
Govind.

441
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,440
A surgical strike, sir.

442
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,880
Surgical strike.

443
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,960
Infiltrate POK and annihilate
their terrorist launchpads...

444
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,560
their hidden terrorists,
their handlers, and guides.

445
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,880
And looking at Pakistan's
nature they will never admit...

446
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,920
that terrorists
are breeding on their land.

447
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,280
So, if there are no terrorists, then
there's no question of a strike, right?

448
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,120
And, since there's no strike, there's no
point of war or international pressure.

449
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,600
Most important...

450
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,360
this is our biggest opportunity
to strike back for Uri.

451
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,480
Doesn't a surgical strike
sound a bit dangerous?

452
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,160
We can use our jet fighters to bomb
some of their bunkers near the LC.

453
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,520
During the Munich Olympics, PLO
terrorists killed Israeli athletes.

454
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,200
But Israel didn't strike back by
just firing a couple of missiles.

455
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,560
They engaged Operation
'Wrath of God'.

456
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,120
They hunted down every single terrorist,

457
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,920
dragged them from their home
and killed them.

458
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,680
In the history of India, we have
never attacked any country first.

459
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,640
And Pakistan has been taking advantage
of our nature from the beginning.

460
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,720
1947, '65, '71... '99...

461
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,600
In fact, sir. Our tolerance
is being mistaken as our weakness.

462
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,320
This is our chance to
instil fear in their hearts.

463
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,760
Make them believe that India
will not take things lying down.

464
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,040
This is a New India.

465
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,880
We will infiltrate them
and hit them where it hurts.

466
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,960
Ravinder...

467
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,480
We have no enmity with
the Pakistani population.

468
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,400
Our war is against terrorism.

469
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,880
I think Govind is right.

470
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,600
Arjun.

471
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,280
I think it's a good idea, sir.

472
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,720
Fine...

473
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,640
In 10 days we'll carry out the most
lethal surgical strike in Pakistan.

474
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,680
Ravinder, you prepare
a team along with Arjun.

475
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,120
And you will lead this mission.

476
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,960
You will do all the planning.

477
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,280
And you will update
me about their progress every day.

478
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,760
Everyone else keeps the
Pakistani authorities busy.

479
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,120
Give them evidence
of the Uri attack.

480
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,240
Ask them for an explanation.

481
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,560
But at no cost should
anyone get a whiff of our plan.

482
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,920
Remember...

483
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,840
these meetings
shouldn't be logged.

484
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,320
Did you eat?

485
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,960
No, sir. Don't feel like it.

486
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,160
Wait, I'll get something.
- No, sir.

487
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,920
I am in a hurry.

488
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,440
I... have received my orders.

489
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,560
They are planning
an operation in Kashmir.

490
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,640
I don't know the details, but...

491
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,240
I guess...

492
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,760
they are planning
to strike back to avenge Uri.

493
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,600
Karan sir always said...

494
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,200
not a single man can die
when Vihaan's around.

495
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,720
He'll even fight
with Death to save us.

496
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,040
I really wish you were
there to lead us, sir.

497
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,960
I found two dirty shirts
amongst Karan's stuff.

498
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,800
And I don't know what to do.

499
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,520
I don't want to wash them

500
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,520
or hand them over to someone else.

501
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,840
I can still feel his
essence in them, Vihaan.

502
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,360
Sir, you once mentioned
in your lecture...

503
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,200
there exists a thin line between
responsible and irresponsible.

504
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,360
I don't want to be on
the other side of that line.

505
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,640
If I don't fight for my men,
my country now...

506
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,960
then I'll be irresponsible
in my own opinion.

507
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,040
And I won't be able
to live with that.

508
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,360
I promise you, sir, you can send me
to any corner of this world to fight.

509
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,480
I will bring all my soldiers
back safe and sound.

510
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,640
Sir, let me be a part
of this mission in Kashmir.

511
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,400
I request you, sir. Please.

512
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,440
Vihaan,

513
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,120
in 8 days you're going to
conduct a surgical strike in POK.

514
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,720
Tomorrow morning Lt. Gn. Grewal

515
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,240
will brief you about this operation.

516
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,360
You will do the entire
on ground planning with him.

517
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,920
Prepare the best team you can.

518
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,760
And revert back to me by the 23rd night
with each and every detail.

519
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,160
Understood, sir.

520
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,800
I wish you all the best.

521
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,120
Thank you very much, sir.

522
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,760
I've scoured these
hills for 40 years.

523
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
When I close my eyes,
I don't see my children's faces.

524
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,840
I see Kashmir's
territorial map instead.

525
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,200
And that's why Vihaan,

526
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,320
it will be easy to enter POK.

527
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,240
But what will be difficult
is getting out after the attack.

528
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
I understand, sir.

529
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,360
We will plan for everything.

530
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:56,920
Did you finalize the team?

531
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,280
Out of the soldiers
that died in the Uri attack...

532
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,280
most of them belonged
to the Dogra and Bihar Regiment.

533
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,560
My advice is that

534
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,400
we should include this regiment's
special team in this mission as well.

535
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,480
To win a war,
very often a soldier's emotions,

536
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,760
are more important than his training.

537
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,200
I want to put their anger
and passion to the right use.

538
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,840
At ease.

539
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,640
Commandos.

540
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,200
My name is Major Vihaan Shergill.

541
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,840
And that's Capt. Sartaj.

542
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,000
Please take your phones out.

543
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,440
Now send a text to your family.

544
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,200
Saying that you'll be in Udhampur till
the morning of the 29th of September...

545
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,560
for a special tactical training.

546
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,160
And you won't be allowed to communicate
with anyone during this training.

547
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,200
As a result,

548
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,040
you'll keep your phones
switched off for the next 7 days.

549
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,080
Send it.

550
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,400
Is it sent?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,520
Good. Sartaj.

552
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,960
Now you will all put
your phones in this bag.

553
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,760
And your phones will be returned to you
only on the morning of 29th September.

554
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,080
What I am going to tell you next...

555
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,280
shall never be mentioned
again until your last breath.

556
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,240
On the night of 28th September...

557
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,320
I will give you a chance to avenge our
brothers who died in the Uri attack.

558
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,160
Just like those coward
terrorists brutally killed...

559
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,360
our unarmed brothers
in their sleep...

560
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,840
we will give them a fitting reply...

561
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,080
A chance to behead them.

562
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,800
Are you ready for this mission?
- Yes, sir.

563
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,480
Is your blood boiling for revenge?
- Yes, sir.

564
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,920
Commandos.

565
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,440
Who are we?
- Indian army, sir!

566
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,720
The Indian Army did not start this war
but we will bloody hell finish it.

567
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,760
Yes, sir!

568
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,280
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!

569
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,640
How is the spirit?
- High, sir!

570
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,080
I said how is the spirit?
- High, sir!

571
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,080
Good!

572
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,480
Yes, sir.

573
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,280
It's completely our fault.

574
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,560
We'll definitely find out.

575
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,360
We'll have to.

576
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,800
Don't worry.

577
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,440
Goodbye.

578
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,280
You guys are bunch of stupid
lowlife nincompoops.

579
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,200
You don't have kids, right?

580
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,040
Don't even try.

581
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,200
For the past one month
I've been saying...

582
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,560
that there's a mole in our office who
has been syphoning information to India.

583
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,440
And you guys can't find him.

584
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,360
I swear.

585
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,400
I am starting to feel that...

586
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,360
that could it be one of you?

587
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,200
Can you even imagine
the pressure on me?

588
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,600
One week...

589
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,840
If you don't find
that guy in a week,

590
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:48,520
I'll have one of
you for dinner, and...

591
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,960
I won't even burp.

592
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,200
Don't just stand there
staring at my face.

593
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,280
Get lost.

594
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,680
And Karim, give that file to me.

595
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,240
Stupid idiots.

596
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,720
Mother, it's me.

597
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,240
Hello. How are you?

598
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,240
You wanted Bilqis
aunt's number, right?

599
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,280
Take a pen and note it down.

600
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,120
34...

601
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,360
49...

602
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,160
58...

603
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,080
8... 74...

604
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,680
2201...

605
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,440
2

606
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,160
Yes..

607
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,040
No, I'm feeling a little acidic.

608
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,760
The indigestion
is causing me to burp.

609
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,720
My stomach is not doing so well.

610
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,440
Also note down
Munnu uncle's number.

611
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,840
Sir, we got the coordinates.

612
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,840
There's a total of seven locations,
all close to LC.

613
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,560
We'll have to physically find the location
of their launchpads in these areas.

614
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,680
Call Srinivas at ISRO.
- Yes, sir.

615
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,440
The pictures from Tripura, Assam
are not clear due to heavy rains.

616
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,720
Hello.
- Govind speaking.

617
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
Bharadwaj.

618
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,680
Hi, Govind. Tell me.

619
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,280
Listen, I'm sending
you some coordinates.

620
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,440
I want you to position the
RISAT 1 or the RISAT 2 satellite

621
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:46,120
over these coordinates
for the next six days.

622
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,080
And don't move them, come what may.
- Okay.

623
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,400
Secondly, relay all the
images directly to Raisina Hills.

624
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,760
We have only two hours.
- Okay.

625
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:01,240
You will personally scan every
location with the Army Intelligence.

626
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:07,000
only when we have every
detail about the all the locations.

627
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,200
Correct?
- Yes, sir.

628
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,480
Done, sir.

629
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,720
Send this feed directly
to Raisina Hills.

630
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,880
Sir. We have the feed.

631
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,080
Pallavi.

632
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,800
Pallavi Sharma.

633
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,560
You asked me my real name that day.

634
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,800
I am really sorry about that day.

635
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,240
It's okay.

636
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,760
In fact, even I might have reacted
the same way if I was in your place.

637
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,560
How is your mom?

638
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,600
She is...

639
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,000
She is fine.

640
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,160
Neha is staying with her.

641
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,640
We've also appointed a
full-time nurse, so let's see.

642
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,440
I hope she's better than me.

643
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,320
I think its time. We should get going.

644
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,320
I'll look into this.

645
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,360
Sir.

646
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,240
Sir.
- Vihaan. Come, sit.

647
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,880
Have you selected your team?
- Yes, sir.

648
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,920
And what about their advanced
tactical commando training?

649
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,440
It's begun, sir.
- Good.

650
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,960
Pallavi. You can begin.
- Sir.

651
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,440
Sir, we've confirmed 5 launchpads
of Hizbul, Lashkar, and Jaish.

652
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,920
Two in Lipa Valley.
Two in Kel.

653
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,160
And one in Bhimber.

654
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,840
These launchpads were easy to find
because they were in isolated areas.

655
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,200
And the remaining two are...

656
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,720
possibly located in the populated
areas of the Muzaffarabad district.

657
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,840
Identifying the exact
location through satellites

658
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,160
in a crowded area
is a little difficult.

659
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,080
I will check at DRDO tomorrow,

660
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,640
whether they can help us
in finding the launchpads.

661
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,840
And Pallavi, keep giving Vihaan all
the details about these launchpads. - Sir.

662
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,400
Vihaan, any suggestion or question?

663
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,560
Which of these launchpads
were used for the Uri attack?

664
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,800
We believe that the attackers came from
one of the launchpads in Muzaffarabad.

665
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:53,640
And who was the
handler of that attack?

666
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,040
We still don't have any
information on that. Sorry.

667
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,960
These Sigma 5 drones
are our latest invention.

668
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,080
Developed along with...

669
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,360
Israeli intelligence.

670
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,920
Sir,

671
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,360
their range is
close to 50 kilometres.

672
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,320
And they can fly as low
as 2 kilometres above ground.

673
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,480
That's fine, Brian,

674
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,240
but how close can it come to the ground,
without getting detected.

675
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,920
Meaning?

676
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,480
Meaning I want a drone that can
fly outside our enemy's window...

677
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,800
without getting detected.

678
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,320
Sir, that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

679
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,880
I thought as much.

680
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,440
Sir, he's our intern.

681
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,320
What's your name, son?
- Ishaan.

682
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,920
Ishaan Wattal, sir.

683
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,360
What is this?

684
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,640
Sir, it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.

685
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,840
Shaped like an eagle.

686
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,040
What is it called?
- Garuda.

687
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,400
Garuda. Based on Vishnu Puran.
- Ahh... Vishnu Puran.

688
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,880
Sorry, since there are already
so many projects underway...

689
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,720
I use the spare parts
to pass some time. That's it.

690
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,520
Ishaan, make it fly. Come.

691
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:26,960
Sorry, sir.

692
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,880
Sir.

693
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,960
Sir, when I say so
you must run fast

694
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,680
and throw the Garuda
in the air with full force.

695
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,120
Just a minute, sir.

696
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,360
Raise your hand.

697
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,440
Higher, sir.

698
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,160
A little more.

699
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
Sorry, sir.

700
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,440
Sir, 3...

701
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,840
2...

702
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,560
1...

703
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,080
What's the range?

704
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
Sir, it can fly up to
a distance of 12 kilometres...

705
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,360
and its got four hours of
battery backup on a single charge.

706
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,960
Infrared and night vision enabled.

707
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,000
It has a 16-megapixel camera
and 7.2x digital zoom.

708
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,920
And it can also hover at one
place for take-off and landing...

709
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:56,880
Like...

710
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,000
this.

711
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,800
If it can hover at one
place for taking off and landing,

712
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,200
then why did you make Brian run.

713
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,560
Brian.
- Yes, sir.

714
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,640
I need four such
Garudas by tomorrow.

715
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,240
Tomorrow?

716
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,040
Sir, this is just a prototype which
this kid has made just to pass time.

717
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,960
It hasn't been commissioned
yet and the R&amp;D for it...

718
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,720
Can four such Garudas
be made by tomorrow?

719
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,520
We can if the entire team chips in.

720
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,440
Good. Brian, stop everything else

721
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:39,480
and start a separate assembly line, and
put all your technicians to work on this.

722
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,960
Tomorrow afternoon I want Ishaan on a
flight to Kashmir along with four Garudas.

723
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,480
Okay.

724
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,800
You might have just
won us the war, son.

725
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,560
Good job.

726
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,720
Thank... Sorry, sir.

727
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,520
Sir.

728
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,720
Time to prove your
patriotism to Jaskirat.

729
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,280
You're going to be my pilot, Seerat.

730
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,680
Sir...

731
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,360
Excuse me.
- Yes.

732
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,400
Hello. - The army has arrested
two guides in Baramulla.

733
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,200
Chances are they have
information about the Uri attack.

734
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,360
Govind sir wants both of
us involved in the interrogation.

735
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,480
When are you leaving?
- 2 hours.

736
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,560
Palam Air Force Base.

737
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,800
Who was the handler for the
Uri attack?

738
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,320
Where was it planned?

739
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,040
I don't know anything, madam.

740
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,880
I sell nuts in Batmaylu...

741
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,360
Make another excuse
and I will burst your nuts.

742
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,440
Believe me, madam...

743
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,040
Oh Mother...

744
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,400
Oh Mother...

745
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,400
Who was involved in the Uri attack?
I want names.

746
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:44,840
Who was involved?

747
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,480
Who was the handler
for the Uri attack?

748
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,120
Oh Mother...
- Farooq, I need names.

749
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,000
Oh Mother...

750
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,520
Who were they?
- Oh Mother...

751
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,440
Oh Mother...

752
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Who he is?

753
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,760
He's my brother?

754
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,320
What's his name?

755
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,800
Faizal.

756
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
Look Faizal,

757
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,200
we're running out of time.

758
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,160
Your brother has two options.

759
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:35,960
First,

760
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,680
he politely gives us the
name of the handler of the Uri attack.

761
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:41,960
Second,

762
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,720
I can spill your guts out.

763
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,440
Some tea?

764
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,720
No. Stop him, ma'am.

765
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,440
Please stop him, madam.
He's just a kid.

766
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,200
He will die, madam.
He's just a kid.

767
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,600
Madam.

768
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,640
Madam...

769
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,360
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

770
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,400
Idris.

771
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,640
Idris Qayoom Al Baghdadi.

772
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:53,640
He made the plan.

773
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,800
And Jabbar Firozi was the handler.

774
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,360
This is Idris and that's Jabbar.

775
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,480
They were the planners
and handlers for the attack...

776
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,080
on Uri and on
Pampore before that.

777
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,120
Idris is from Sialkot
and Jabbar is from Gilgit.

778
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,800
Seven years ago they met in one of the
training camps of Jaish-e-Mohammad...

779
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,040
and a few years later,
under the supervision of Jaish...

780
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:55,360
they started their own
highly specialized terrorist group.

781
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,400
Sirat-UL-Jannat.

782
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,640
Their B-2 training center and
Launchpad is in the Chakothi village...

783
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,920
which is near the Aman Setu ridge
and Muzaffarabad district.

784
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,400
Their guides use the natural caves
situated in the jungles around them to...

785
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,040
infiltrate the terrorists into India.

786
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,200
We've given the army
the locations of these caves.

787
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,800
They are keeping
a watch on these caves.

788
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,400
Four UAVs will be sent to
Kashmir tomorrow from the DRDO...

789
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,360
for additional surveillance.

790
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,840
You must increase shelling
at the LC from tomorrow.

791
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,800
And keep increasing the intensity
gradually so that on the night of 28th...

792
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:27,960
we reach the
peak of our shelling.

793
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,840
Especially in the areas

794
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,440
from where our soldiers
will infiltrate into POK.

795
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,160
"I will fight."

796
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:48,720
"I will fight."

797
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:53,480
"The fire in my blood
makes me want to fight."

798
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,560
"I will go to any lengths.
That's my heart's desire."

799
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:03,840
"A passionate soul is ready to die
for his country. He is fearless."

800
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,040
"The enemies are afraid of him."

801
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,880
"A soldier fights till his last breath."

802
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:17,400
"He faces death fearlessly
and leaves the enemies trembling."

803
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,720
"I will fight."

804
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,400
There are some boulders
here where you can hide...

805
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,160
but a Pakistani forward post is
at a distance of 60 meters from here.

806
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,040
Take the flight recorders
out of all the choppers.

807
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,760
And color it the same
way as the Pakistani Air Force.

808
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,360
"Our hearts are lit up
with our passion."

809
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,640
"We are not afraid of holding
the flames in our hand."

810
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:58,480
"We will do something admirable."

811
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,520
"And set a good example
for the world."

812
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,440
"I will fight..."

813
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:12,880
"It's the burning desire
of my heart to go to any lengths."

814
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,720
"A soldier never gives up
even till his last breath."

815
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,960
"He embraces danger
and brings down his enemies."

816
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,120
"A brave heart is ready to die
for his country. He is heroic."

817
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:32,800
"He embraces death
and doesn't spare his enemies."

818
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,920
As of 0900 hours,
India has intensified the shelling.

819
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,840
I guess India is still looking

820
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,120
for a befitting reply to our
Prime Minister's speech at the UN.

821
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,840
Sir, I doubt whether this
shelling is for distracting us.

822
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,720
In case if they were
planning another attack...

823
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,560
then our intelligence agency
must have got some kind of news.

824
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,480
India is in no position
to think about another attack.

825
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,960
They are already in a difficult
position with the issue of Kashmir.

826
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,080
This drama will continue
a little longer at the LOC.

827
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,960
Our actors and singers
will be banned.

828
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,640
Trade will get affected.

829
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,400
But soon everything will cool down.

830
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,080
But, we should not make the mistake
of underestimating our enemy.

831
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,480
Zubair.
- Yes.

832
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,680
Afzal.
- Sir.

833
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,400
I should be getting
updates every minute.

834
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,120
Send all the ammunition
you can at the LOC.

835
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,400
We must give a
fitting reply as well.

836
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,720
Is that understood?

837
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,040
Yes, sir.
- Good.

838
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,240
What happened at the meeting today?

839
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,360
You're playing awkward shots today.

840
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,840
There was a strong debate over LOC.

841
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,320
The Indians have made our lives
difficult with their constant shelling.

842
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,960
Some important decisions
were taken today in the meeting.

843
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,760
Forget that.

844
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,000
Watch this shot.

845
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:54,960
Watch this.

846
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,760
No Zameer,

847
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,000
your head's not in the game today.

848
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,400
You know what, come home.

849
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,320
I'll tell Aasma to make your favourite
dish and your favourite dessert.

850
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,440
No. Not today.

851
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,400
I'll have to stay awake
all night with the Minister sir.

852
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,680
And tomorrow we might have
to go on a rendezvous of the LOC.

853
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,560
Maybe some other day.

854
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,480
What are you plans for 28th?

855
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:26,560
28... Yes, 28th is great.

856
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,240
Sure.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

857
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,520
Come let's look for the ball now.

858
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,000
Can you get me a closer shot?
- Yeah, sure.

859
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,880
Slightly to the right.

860
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,040
Good job, Ishaan. Good job.

861
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,200
Hey...

862
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,600
sit down.

863
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,360
Get it out now, Ishaan.
- I am trying.

864
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,360
Ishaan, come on. Come on, Ishaan.

865
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,520
Come on.

866
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,280
A toy.

867
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,960
Yes... yes...

868
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,360
Try.. come on, Ishaan.

869
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,680
Sir this is the B-2 launchpad

870
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,800
where the terrorist responsible
for the Uri attack came from.

871
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,440
A double storied building with 38 highly
trained terrorist and 5 exit points.

872
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,000
Has our intelligence
confirmed these details?

873
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,040
Yes, sir.

874
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,400
I've personally checked
every launchpad.

875
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,680
What is the plan to attack?

876
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,040
Sir, our 80 commandos
are fully prepared.

877
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,720
On the night of 28th, when
our shelling will be at its peak...

878
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:37,680
we'll enter POK in four
low flying MI-17 helicopters.

879
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,560
And we'll start our
attack at exactly 2 am.

880
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,280
These 80 commandos will be
divided into four teams of 20 each.

881
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,320
Every team will have
to destroy two targets.

882
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,080
Team Alpha, Along with
Major Vihaan, will first destroy B-1

883
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:53,600
and theJabbar and Idris' B-2 launchpad.

884
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,320
Similarly teams Bravo,
Charlie, Delta,

885
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:00,200
will destroy their targets
in Lipa, Bimber, and Kel.

886
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,520
On the positive side, all these
targets are quite close to the LC...

887
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,760
which means from landing
to take off, the entire mission...

888
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,120
should last only for 50 minutes.

889
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,000
Which means by 3 am

890
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:13,720
we should be back in our choppers.

891
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,200
And by 5 am...

892
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,760
we'll be at the Srinagar base.

893
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,120
There will be no
meetings here today.

894
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,800
As you've all been told earlier,
we'll spend a normal day tomorrow...

895
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,400
with the press and public.

896
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,640
On the 28th late night, there should
be no one here from the Ministry.

897
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,840
Other than the Army
Intelligence, only

898
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,560
Arjun and Govind will
be allowed to stay here.

899
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,800
Vihaan, when are
you leaving for Kashmir?

900
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,840
Sir, we leave tomorrow
from the Northern Command.

901
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,880
Vihaan, I've heard that you've promised

902
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,240
to bring all your soldiers back safe
and sound.

903
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:51,560
Sir, with your permission.

904
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,680
My commandos &amp; I would like to have
dinner with you on the 30th night.

905
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,640
Jai Hind.

906
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,560
Jai Hind, sir.

907
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:15,640
Capt. Ved.

908
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,600
Akram.

909
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,520
Bali.

910
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,440
You three will lead the Bravo, Charlie,

911
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,320
and Delta, teams.

912
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,120
As soon as we para-drop in POK,

913
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,720
we'll be easy targets.

914
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,280
So we must carefully, and stealthily,

915
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,600
make it to our launchpads.

916
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,840
Once we reach, again...

917
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,880
Outer parameters, Snipers.

918
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:41,800
Inner parameters, Assaulters.

919
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,840
Every team will be
carrying a signal jammer...

920
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:45,760
so that they cannot use radio-signals

921
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:51,240
or mobile phones to call for help...
during the attack.

922
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,760
Remember boys,
our return is the toughest part.

923
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,320
Our backs will be facing the enemy,

924
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,560
and they will be firing at us.

925
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,120
So we have to be quick.

926
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,800
Any questions?
- No, sir.

927
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,480
I've promised that you will all return
with me to India safe and sound.

928
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,920
And I bloody well intend
to keep my promise.

929
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,840
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

930
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,800
Our assets in Muzaffarabad
and Gilgit have sent updates.

931
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,160
It says that India is going to escalate
their shelling at the maximum today.

932
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,280
Excuse me.

933
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,720
Sir.

934
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,600
Commandos.

935
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,160
The time has come

936
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,840
to make them bleed for their deeds.

937
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,360
They want Kashmir
and we want their heads.

938
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,600
Are you ready, boys?
- Yes, sir.

939
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,040
How is the spirit?
- High, sir.

940
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:03,560
How is the spirit?
- High, sir.

941
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,000
Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind!

942
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:05,880
Go. Go. Go.

943
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,280
All the best...
- All the best...

944
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,880
All the best... Go. Go.

945
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,640
It was really dark.

946
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,720
I was really doing her hard.

947
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,440
Little did I know
that she was a virgin.

948
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,240
Aasma.
- Yes.

949
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,760
Get some ice for Zameer.

950
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,680
Here. - Aasma, you've kept yourself busy
in the kitchen...

951
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,280
while we're getting
bored out here.

952
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,840
Come and join us.

953
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:57,960
I can't do two jobs at once especially
when I am cooking this exquisite dish.

954
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,560
I'll join you in a while.

955
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,160
You're looking much better today.

956
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,560
You've been really worried
for the past couple of days.

957
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,160
What can I say?

958
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,640
These Indians have
made my life hell.

959
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,440
I wonder what else they are
planning along with the shelling.

960
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:17,600
But our spies are
no less than them.

961
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,680
We've taken all the precautions.

962
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,240
Did you taste these dates?

963
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,400
Thank God, food is ready.

964
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:08,520
Now make me a large peg,
with lots of ice. - Of course.

965
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,760
So Zameer,
how is your better half?

966
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,120
She's in Birmingham.

967
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,120
For the graduation ceremony
of my youngest daughter.

968
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,640
I was supposed to go as well.

969
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,120
But all thanks to the issues on the
LOC,

970
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,520
which spoiled all my plans.

971
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,480
There's nothing we can do.

972
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:30,920
Well...

973
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,440
Cheers.

974
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,640
Aasma, since when
did you start drinking whiskey?

975
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,600
What?

976
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:51,400
You normally drink wine, don't you?

977
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:59,840
So I thought let's give
whiskey a shot instead.

978
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:05,680
There's something unique about...

979
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,240
women who drink whiskey.

980
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,680
Wow!

981
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,120
Let's go.
- We are taking off.

982
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,160
Salim, Raisina Hills.

983
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,840
Zameer?

984
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,240
Zameer?

985
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,240
Zameer?

986
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,520
Zameer?

987
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,560
Zameer? Zameer?

988
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,120
What was the decision taken
against India in today's meeting?

989
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:21,560
Were the words "Surgical Strike"
used in the meeting today?

990
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,240
Were the words "Surgical Strike"
used in the meeting today?

991
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,440
Zameer?

992
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:33,440
Dear, what are you doing?
- Zameer,

993
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,920
what was the decision
taken in the meeting today?

994
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,800
Zameer?

995
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:39,520
What did the Minister say?

996
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,440
Zameer?

997
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,560
Radar... AEWAC... radar.

998
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,480
We've received some
Intel from our spies.

999
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,200
They have spotted helicopters near
the LOC painted in Pakistani colours.

1000
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,320
Their helicopters were repainted.

1001
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,160
Maybe they are planning to fly low from
the LOC and attack our forward posts.

1002
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,000
Is there any way we can stop them?

1003
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,840
We should launch the AEWAC
radar near the Uri sector.

1004
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,720
If the enemy helicopter comes anywhere
within 20 meters of the LOC...

1005
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,880
then our anti-aircraft missiles
will shoot it down immediately.

1006
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,760
Hello.
- Alpha Team needs to abort the mission.

1007
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,600
I repeat, the Alpha
team must abort the mission.

1008
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:27,640
What?

1009
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,920
Sir.

1010
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,080
We've detected air
activity at the LC.

1011
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:49,880
Keep the anti-aircraft
missiles ready.

1012
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,440
Sir.
- Pallavi,

1013
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:01,720
has Vihaan's chopper taken off?
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,560
They will cross LC in 10 seconds.

1015
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,720
Connect me to Vihaan now.

1016
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,760
Vihaan, I've patched
you with Govind sir.

1017
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,400
Sir, Vihaan is online.

1018
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,720
Vihaan, don't cross the LC.

1019
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,800
I repeat, do not cross the LC.

1020
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,160
Turn your choppers around.

1021
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,520
Turn around! Turn around!

1022
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,080
They have launched the
AEWAC radar in Muzaffarabad sector.

1023
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,680
That means Alpha
team cannot cross by air.

1024
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,360
We'll have to abort your mission.

1025
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,920
Pallavi, listen.

1026
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:58,080
During Farooq's
interrogation he said that...

1027
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,040
he used to bring terrorists
to India through the caves...

1028
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,880
which our army
is keeping an eye on.

1029
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,720
Get me the exact
coordinates to those caves.

1030
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,440
If we can't go through the air,
then we'll go by land.

1031
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,120
But we will complete this
mission today at any cost.

1032
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,840
Bravo, Charlie, Delta,

1033
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,280
you
three will move ahead as planned.

1034
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,640
There will be radio silence
amongst all the teams now.

1035
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,400
We'll only be in touch with
the army intelligence directly.

1036
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,480
They will keep me posted.

1037
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,120
Correct! Bravo, Charlie, Delta...

1038
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,040
Your areas are safe
according to Intelligence.

1039
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:27,520
Move ahead as planned.

1040
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,840
Sir.
- What's the status?

1041
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,240
Sir, we are still figuring out
the coordinates.

1042
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,840
Thank you.
- Welcome sir.

1043
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:58,680
Let's go.

1044
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:03,360
Sir, entering a cave blindly without a
recce and monitoring is way to risky.

1045
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:13,400
There might be Rangers or Terrorists
posted for guarding these caves.

1046
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,560
Vihaan, wait.

1047
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,720
Is Ishaan online? Can he hear us?

1048
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:37,640
Yes, sir. He can.

1049
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,120
Ishaan.
- Sir.

1050
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:42,280
Can you see the GPS location
of all the four teams?

1051
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:43,840
Yes, sir. I can see it.
- Good.

1052
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,400
From now on you're
going to be their eyes.

1053
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,560
Tell the operators
that all the four Garudas...

1054
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,840
will stay a few meters
ahead of the team leaders.

1055
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,120
And you keep tracking
their position through GPS.

1056
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,040
As soon as you sense any danger,
you must inform the team leader.

1057
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,280
Sure, sir.

1058
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:38,160
Sir!

1059
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,280
Sir, we're in Pakistan
Occupied Kashmir.

1060
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,320
Good job, Vihaan.

1061
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,600
The other teams are
soon reaching their targets.

1062
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,480
Bilal? Dawood?

1063
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,400
Say hello to your brothers in hell.

1064
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,040
And ask them to hold on
to the celebrations.

1065
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,240
We plan to send them
a lot more guests tonight.

1066
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:27,520
Sir, the first
operation was a success.

1067
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,080
We've destroyed the B-1 launchpad.

1068
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,760
What is the status
of the remaining teams?

1069
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,560
Teams Bravo and Charlie have
attacked their secondary location.

1070
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:36,360
Team Delta is preparing to return
after completing their mission.

1071
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,480
Not a single casualty.
- Good.

1072
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,840
Let's go.

1073
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,080
Abdullah!
- Yes.

1074
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,160
Come here.

1075
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,760
Take Zameer sir home. He's had
a little too much to drink today.

1076
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,680
Yes.

1077
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,880
Come on... Go out quickly.

1078
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,000
Where is Idris?

1079
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,600
Where is Idris?

1080
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,520
Where is Idris?

1081
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:52,400
Camera!

1082
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,840
Camera!

1083
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,160
Camera!

1084
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,960
Did you find Idris?

1085
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,560
No, sir.

1086
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,000
I don't think he's here.

1087
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:10,920
He's here.

1088
01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:35,680
Sir, someone has informed the Police.
They are just two minutes away.

1089
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:36,720
Vihaan, hurry up.

1090
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,240
Copy, sir.

1091
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,040
But Idris has to die.
- But, Vihaan.

1092
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,680
Sartaj, move.

1093
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:40,920
You barged into my home
and killed my brothers.

1094
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:43,800
Today I barged into your
home and I'm killing your brothers.

1095
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,280
We are the Indian Army.

1096
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,240
Indian Army!

1097
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:18,560
Ishaan, where to?

1098
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:21,800
Sir, lower east side. Out
the small door and into the fields.

1099
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,520
Who's there? I'll shoot.

1100
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:53,640
Sartaj.

1101
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:16,440
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1102
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,880
Boys go faster. Faster. Faster.

1103
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,240
Sir, be ready. We're getting
a Pakistani chopper along with us.

1104
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:19,240
Vihaan, we're sending
jets to give you cover fire.

1105
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:20,880
They will be at your
location in 10 minutes.

1106
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:22,000
Copy, sir.

1107
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:42,960
Sir, we're running
out of ammunition.

1108
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,880
We can't hold them
off for 10 minutes.

1109
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:49,240
Come what may, but every soldier
will make it back home alive today.

1110
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,520
Seerat, now!

1111
02:01:26,120 --> 02:01:28,640
Jaskirat, this is for you.

1112
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,000
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1113
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,160
Sir, we did it.

1114
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,640
Bravo, Charlie, Delta,
what's your status?

1115
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:45,120
Every mission was a success.

1116
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:46,920
Not a single casualty.

1117
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:48,960
I am extremely
proud of you my boys.

1118
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:57,320
Thank you, sir.

1119
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,800

"This is a different experience."

02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:17,200
"This is a different experience."
