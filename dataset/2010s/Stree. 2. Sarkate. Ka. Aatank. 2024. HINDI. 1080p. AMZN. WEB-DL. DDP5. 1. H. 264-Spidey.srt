1
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,050
Attention everyone!

2
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,390
The Mahapooja (grand veneration)
festivities begin today.

3
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,510
The veneration of the Mahapooja

4
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,680
will be carried out by female devotees,

5
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,300
as it was done last time.

6
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,640
And the men are requested

7
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,340
to use a rattle

8
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,510
to entertain themselves
as well as the children.

9
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,760
All the women are requested

10
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,890
to wear red saris

11
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,350
and assemble in the temple courtyard.

12
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,770
"She'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

13
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,300
"Go for it, DJ!"

14
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,180
"She'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

15
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,850
"Yeah, she'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

16
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,970
"In the lonely streets,"

17
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,300
"In the lonely streets,"

18
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,760
"She'd call out to men from behind."

19
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,050
"Yeah, she'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

20
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,720
"With her voice so mesmerizing,
she'd steal their hearts,"

21
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,720
"Yeah, she'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

22
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,970
"And, and, and..."

23
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,720
"And if anyone dared
to turn around and look,"

24
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,010
"She would strip him bare,"

25
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,920
- Oh no!
- Oh God! - What are you saying?

26
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,640
"She would strip him bare,
And take him away fast."

27
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,720
"She'd visit during the grand
veneration festivities, it's true,"

28
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,720
"So in Chanderi,
the men used to not step out of the house,"

29
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,180
"English lyrics, huh?"

30
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760
"Brother Rudra!"

31
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,090
"And those who went out,
they dressed in a sari and blouse."

32
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,890
"It was hard to get rid of Stree,"

33
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,840
"That's why everyone
wrote outside their homes -"

34
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,510
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

35
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,100
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

36
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,970
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

37
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,260
"No, don't come today,"

38
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,090
"O Stree, come tomorrow,"

39
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,350
"Then came the protector of Chanderi,
mighty and bold,"

40
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,850
"He risked it all, made his move,"

41
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,010
"He looked into Stree's eyes,
with affection so true,"

42
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,920
"With love..."

43
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,840
"Stree's strength was in her braid,"

44
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,850
In her braid!

45
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,510
And the protector chopped it off too,"

46
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,420
"Chopped off!"

47
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,930
"He chopped off that braid
and saved all the men,"

48
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,720
"And gave Stree - "

49
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,090
"The love and respect she deserved."

50
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,220
"The love and respect she deserved."

51
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,010
"The love and respect she deserved."

52
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,050
"The love and respect she deserved."

53
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,510
Brother Rudra?

54
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,090
Looks like someone had a little
too much to drink last night, hmm?

55
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,510
Barfing and all?

56
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,220
Knowledge.

57
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,090
Just getting some knowledge out
of my system.

58
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,050
You know, when you've got too much knowledge it overflows,
you've got to find a way to let it all out.

59
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,470
What brings you here?

60
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,050
Oh, I just came by to drop off
this old letter for you.

61
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,550
I found it
when I was cleaning up the place.

62
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,970
Wow, that's pretty quick service, Postman.

63
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,010
A letter that was received
during the Pooja,

64
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,800
is being delivered during
the Mahapooja?

65
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,890
Who sent it?

66
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,260
I was kind of curious myself about
who would bother sending you a letter--

67
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,100
- Hmm, maybe it's a love letter?
- Why do you say that?

68
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,680
Well, look at it! It's got all these drawings
of red flowers and vines on it.

69
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,970
And there's some writing in Urdu, too.

70
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,090
You can't read Urdu, huh?

71
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,680
Unknowledgeable man.

72
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,800
Private and confidential.

73
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,680
For Mr. Rudra's eyes only.

74
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,260
Sounds like it's from Shama.

75
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,880
Come on, open it up, let's take a look!

76
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,970
Why don't you read it?

77
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,300
Nah, I can't read Urdu.

78
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,470
You shouldn't be reading
other people's love letters anyway.

79
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,760
Don't get so excited.

80
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,930
Still delivering letters
in the digital age of emails!

81
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,060
You're going to be out
of a job before you know it, buddy.

82
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,270
Better get moving.

83
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,010
That's the trouble with small towns,

84
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,010
everyone's nosy and wants
to read everyone else's mail.

85
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,260
Trollers.

86
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,220
Huh?

87
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,350
Vicky?

88
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,090
Hi.

89
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
Vicky!

90
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,850
Hi!

91
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,800
You? Is that really you?

92
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,060
Yep, it's me.

93
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,800
I thought you were just...

94
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,060
It's been so long.

95
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,930
I've missed you.

96
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,760
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

97
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,090
Right, right, right!

98
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,890
You...

99
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,800
You are still wearing the same old dress.

100
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,930
Yes.

101
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,050
No worries,
I can make you a new one.

102
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,510
In just 31 minutes flat.

103
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,560
But my measurements have changed.

104
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,300
You can take them again if you want.

105
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,050
Perfect.

106
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,880
Nah, I always mess it up
when it comes to you.

107
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,220
Alright, then just do it without
a measuring tape.

108
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,180
- Can I really do that?
- Go for it.

109
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,890
Okay, I'll give that a shot then.

110
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,680
Did you have a little shot
of rum before coming here?

111
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,300
I've never seen you...

112
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,090
Can you see me now?

113
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,010
Or do you need another smack
to wake you up?

114
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,760
Getting a little handsy there
to take my measurements, huh?

115
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,760
You're trying to stitch me
a new blouse?

116
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
You would've kissed me
if I hadn't stopped you.

117
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,850
Well, I...

118
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,350
What's going on here, Vicky?

119
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,970
- So I...
- Oh Chanderi's Forlorn Lover!

120
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,050
Keep daydreaming like this
and you'll be curing your own nightfall problems!

121
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,970
You dress up and sit here waiting for her,

122
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,510
but she's not coming back.

123
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,220
That unfaithful woman
was just an illusion.

124
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,550
- Alright, that's enough, Brother Rudra.
- Yeah, enough already.

125
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,060
She vanished into thin air
from a moving bus!

126
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,310
I'm telling you, I won't tolerate
you saying a single bad word about her.

127
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,890
Anyway, what brings you here this morning?

128
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,930
Why am I here?

129
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,180
Oh right, to show you this.

130
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,010
Take a look.

131
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,720
- Chanderi Puran?
- Yep,

132
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,220
some torn pages from the Chanderi Puran.

133
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,930
Someone sent them to me
in the mail a couple of months ago.

134
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,840
The postman just delivered them today.

135
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,720
Stree was a prostitute.

136
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,050
She had a lover.

137
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,390
We already knew that part.

138
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,890
But we didn't know this.

139
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,800
The letter also included something else.

140
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,180
He is coming back.

141
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,300
Yes.

142
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,890
Who is coming back?

143
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,260
That's the million-dollar question,
isn't it?

144
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,220
We don't know who exactly is coming back.

145
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,140
- He is coming back?
- We have no idea

146
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,890
who tore these pages,

147
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,220
why they did it,

148
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,680
or why they are sending them to me now.

149
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,010
There has to be some secret
agenda behind this.

150
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,600
Maybe someone's trying to warn us.

151
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,850
- Brother Rudra?
- Hmm?

152
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,090
This chapter is done, okay?

153
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,010
You need to find something better
to do with your time.

154
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,930
And do me a favor - brush
your teeth in the mornings.

155
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,920
Don't come here smelling like that.

156
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,130
He is coming back.

157
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,260
Listen, son,

158
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,630
have you ever thought about your future?

159
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,800
The girls here have become quite modern.

160
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,930
One by one, they're leaving town
and moving to the big cities.

161
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,880
I know, Daddy.

162
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,720
They are doing it for their own good.
So what am I supposed to do?

163
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,470
What if there isn't
a single girl left for you?

164
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,930
If there aren't any left, then so be it.

165
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,840
It doesn't make a difference to me.

166
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,060
What are you saying?

167
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,640
Of course, it makes a difference to you.

168
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,260
Stop! Listen up.

169
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,550
It should make a difference to you!

170
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,970
Have a seat.

171
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,840
- I'm running late, Daddy.
- I told you to sit down.

172
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,970
Remember I told you a young person's body

173
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,270
bustles with vitality?

174
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:38,220
Yeah, like a tank full of energy
or something.

175
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,430
Exactly!

176
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,840
It's craving to come out, right?

177
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,010
Yeah,
but you taught me to be self-reliant.

178
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,340
There's a limit to that as well.

179
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,890
Just get to the point.

180
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,220
A virgin oil is healthy,

181
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,390
but a virgin man is not.

182
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,800
You're being too cool about this, Daddy.

183
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,600
- I'm leaving, I'm late.
- Just hear me out.

184
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,060
Do you want to get married or not?

185
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,560
I don't want to. So?

186
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,260
Then there's only one option left.

187
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,520
What?

188
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,760
Take this.

189
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,050
Go and do it.

190
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,380
Go and do what?

191
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,510
Friendship.

192
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,390
- Daddy!
- Yes!

193
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,510
You never know,
perhaps that will bring about a change?

194
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,220
You are committing a sin here.

195
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,850
I'm fasting,

196
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,350
and you're sitting here
saying these wrong things to me.

197
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,430
There's nothing wrong with it.

198
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,140
- But I'm not like that.
- But...

199
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,840
You keep enjoying your unhealthy habits
in your virgin oil.

200
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,890
Hey!

201
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,390
Hey!

202
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,760
Look, I know you won't go
for the friendship thing.

203
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,220
So, I'll just keep the cash.

204
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,800
Say thanks to Uncle.

205
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,550
Want a burger?

206
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,850
Sure.

207
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,640
Nah, I'm fasting.

208
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,510
It's the girls who fast for the boys,
not the other way around!

209
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,880
He's fasting, he says!

210
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,850
You used to fast until just
a few months ago.

211
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,350
I didn't fast for Chitti,

212
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,680
I did it to stay slim and trim.

213
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,470
- I see.
- Considering your situation,

214
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,630
I'd suggest you do
the Akshay Ekadashi fast.

215
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,550
Why?

216
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,810
To get freedom from that unrequited
love you have for that witch.

217
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,390
Like hell, he's in love!

218
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,430
- What?
- That so-called girlfriend of yours,

219
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,340
the one you've bought 40 teddy bears
for in the last four months -

220
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,260
you used my money for that.

221
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,380
- I'm not giving them back.
- Give them back.

222
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,020
Nope, not happening.

223
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,920
- Give them back.
- I won't.

224
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,260
Give me my money back!

225
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,220
This money is mine.

226
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,800
It was your money, but now it's mine.

227
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,850
- I won't give it back.
- Give them back. Hurry up.

228
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,260
Vicky, please.

229
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,640
First ask nicely, with some love.

230
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,850
Vicky, please.

231
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,640
Is this what you call love?

232
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,590
Hmm.

233
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,760
Forget it.

234
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,390
You should beg for it.
That suits you better.

235
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,260
Vicky, pleaseeeee!

236
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,760
I need to buy a gift for Chitti.

237
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,590
- Pleaseeeee!
- Okay, okay, okay.

238
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,140
Alright, alright.

239
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,680
But first, promise
you'll never call her a witch again.

240
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,510
I won't, I promise.

241
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,220
Apologize.

242
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,090
Sorry.

243
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,430
Apologize to her.

244
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,630
She's here?

245
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,300
Say it from the bottom of your heart,
and she'll hear you.

246
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,430
Okay.

247
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,600
Sorry, witch, I didn't...

248
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,470
Sorry, plain simple sorry.

249
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Thank you.

250
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,350
Now I can get her
a teddy bear this month too.

251
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,810
Hey, your little Miss Katrina is here.

252
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,640
Bits!

253
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Burger?

254
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,300
- Ugh.
- Ew, man.

255
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,270
- No.
- You'll start bloating up again.

256
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,380
Your tummy will stick out,

257
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,050
and you'll make me stand
in front of you in all the pictures.

258
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,380
Nah, Bits.
The frontal is not my best angle.

259
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,350
No, I wasn't having it.
Brother Vicky was having it.

260
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,260
Remember, I'm doing "intimate" fasting?

261
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,420
Hey Vicky!

262
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,180
Yes, it's mine.

263
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,550
How is it going?

264
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,840
Where have you been these days?

265
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,640
Why don't you go come for a jog anymore?

266
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,550
Because he's still stuck
in his unrequited love.

267
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,310
Oh no.

268
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,220
Come on, Vicky,
forget about her already.

269
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,430
You can have anyone you want.

270
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,010
What?

271
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Trust me, you're so handsome and talented.

272
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,680
- Aw, come on now...
- Leave Chanderi.

273
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,260
Get out of this place.

274
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,550
- Remember my friends...
- Yeah.

275
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,390
Shardha, Nikku, and Gauri?

276
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,430
They left the town without
even telling anyone.

277
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,430
Okay.

278
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,510
- You should leave too.
- Leave.

279
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,260
You are right.

280
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,850
I think you should leave too.

281
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,380
What or who do you have here anyway?

282
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,550
I'm here!

283
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,510
Ready-made, top-to-toe.

284
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,890
And I take such good care of her.

285
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,770
I've brought you your protein shake too.

286
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,430
You can have it.

287
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,640
It's Monday today.

288
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,930
We have to do that tonight, right?

289
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,140
Yes, we do.

290
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,510
- Okay, I'm running late, so...
- Okay.

291
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,510
Bye, Vicky.

292
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,130
- Bye.
- Come for a jog, okay?

293
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,260
- Bye, Bits.
- Bye.

294
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,350
Bits.

295
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,970
Short for Bittu.

296
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,050
Thank goodness your name isn't Tittu.

- Yes?

- Nah, I am.
- Nah, it's cool.

317
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,050
I'll call Prathamesh.

318
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,350
Why would you call him?

319
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,350
He puts me to sleep so nicely.

320
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:07,010
No need, I'll put you to sleep.
Don't do that.

321
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,510
Alright, I'll sing, I'll sing it well.

If you hadn't told me to
"come down, come down",

336
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,260
I wouldn't have come down.

- Yeah.

I sing her a lullaby.

because we're friends.

- Uncle, we should go upstairs and check on Chitti.
- What happened?

00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,510
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

358
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,090
- Where is Chitti!
- Chitti!

359
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
What the hell just happened?

360
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,930
Chitti!

361
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,430
The car's trashed too.

362
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,050
- Come on!
- Let's go!

363
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,550
What happened?

364
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,180
- That's Bittu!
- Come on, let's go guys.

365
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,470
Who did this?

366
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,550
Did anyone see anything?

367
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,430
Did she run off to Delhi?

368
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,760
She didn't need to break
the wall for that.

369
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,670
She could've just taken the bus.

370
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,590
I've got a bad feeling about this, Vicky.

371
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,380
What happened, Bittu?

372
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,930
Did you see anything?

373
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,970
- Let's go downstairs and look for her.
- Yeah. Let's go.

374
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,090
O dear lord, I earnestly pray,
please keep the evil away.

375
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,310
Chitti!

376
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,260
- Chitti!
- Hello, Aunty.

377
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,590
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

378
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,600
- Chitti's missing.
- Chitti's missing.

379
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,510
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

380
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,390
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

381
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,010
- Chitti!
- Chitti!

382
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,550
Brother Rudra?

383
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,060
- Come here.
- Let's go, let's go.

384
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,760
- Brother Rudra?
- What are you doing here?

385
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,300
Look at this.

386
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,260
It's a huge footprint.

387
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,850
Looks like a Dinosaur's.

388
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,340
So a dinosaur kidnapped Chitti?

389
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,680
Come on,

390
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,930
how can a Jurassic creature be
in a place without even a jogger's park?

391
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,220
- You are right. But then...?
- Whose footprint is this?

392
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,630
It...

393
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,390
It belongs to a demon.

394
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,760
A demon?

395
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,090
Monster! Ogre! Beast!

396
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,890
Bakasura, Banasura,
Bhasmasur, Narakasura, Talasur...

397
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,090
You can find books
on these legendary beings at my store,

398
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,930
with a 5% discount.

399
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,930
Brother Rudra,
can you promote your store later?

400
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,090
First, let's figure
out where Chitti went!

401
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,720
She didn't go anywhere.

402
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,470
He took her.

403
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,880
Who?

404
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,470
A headless guy.

405
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,310
He had no head.

406
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,140
I saw him.

407
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,060
He went this way.

408
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,270
Where? Here?

409
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
This way?

410
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,130
He took her through the wall.

411
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,130
Shut up, pothead.

412
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,140
Enough of this nonsense.

413
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,060
Don't believe a word this pothead says,

414
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,720
just keep looking for the girl.

415
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm sure she's at her friend's place.

416
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,720
Chitti's ice cream printed sock!

417
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,060
Chitti!

418
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,060
Chitti!

419
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,850
Why are you yelling
her name like that, huh?

420
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,930
Chitti is my love.

421
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,300
If it had been my turn
to help her sleep today,

422
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,350
then I would have saved her.

423
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,420
Vicky...

424
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,430
Ms. Stree?

425
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,810
Ms. Stree? It's me, Vicky.

426
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,430
I thought you'd left for good,
but looks like you are back.

427
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,390
Vicky...

428
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,390
Ms. Stree, we...

429
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,590
we're on the same team now, aren't we?

430
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,100
We are friends now.

431
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,010
Sorry about cutting your braid.

432
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,590
Massage your head with warm oil
and it'll grow back in no time.

433
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,550
Ms. Stree, I'm going to turn around now.

434
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:03,050
Don't take off my clothes, please.

435
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,560
We're friends, remember?

436
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,140
Friends.

437
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,770
Ms. Stree?

438
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,800
What's wrong?

439
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Brother Rudra, why did you ditch
that footprint thing and follow me here?

440
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,090
It's me, not your brother Rudra.

441
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,880
You didn't have your daily dose
of rum earlier or what?

442
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,010
Vicky, it's me.

443
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,130
Wait a second.

444
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,300
Bittu?

445
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,010
Daddy?

446
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,720
Badri?

447
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,430
Whoever you are, just give me
a whack and get this over with.

448
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,220
Wake me up.
Go on, slap me.

449
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,680
Hit me.

450
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,090
Huh?

451
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
You...?

452
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,760
You...

453
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,140
You're really back!

454
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,470
You're really back!

455
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,550
You're really back!

456
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,760
You're back!

457
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,430
You're back!

458
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,310
You're back! You're back! You're back!

459
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,970
I thought about you
from the bottom of my heart.

460
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,800
But you took your sweet time to return.

461
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:41,430
You know the names
they call you behind your back?

462
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,590
What?

463
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,340
They call you an illusion,
a witch, an ogress

464
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,060
and say you're an unfaithful lover
who rejected my love,

465
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,390
and now I'll seek my revenge.

466
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,100
That's not all.

467
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,930
You know what they say about me?

468
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,090
They call me Chanderi's Forlorn Lover,
the Ruined Lover Boy,

469
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,390
Weirdo Vicky, Roadside Romeo,
Love Me No More,

470
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,010
Crazy in Love,
the Latest Loser, Crazy Lover,

471
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,670
the Heartbroken Prince
with unrequited love,

472
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,260
Kabir Singh, the Dry Virgin.

473
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,520
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

474
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,550
And you're still the same too.

475
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,140
Speaking of change,

476
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,310
did you change the bus back then?

477
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,720
The conductor said
you just disappeared from the bus, so...

478
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,300
- Everyone has been...
- Can we discuss this stuff later, Vicky?

479
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,770
First,
I need to tell you something important,

480
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,890
that's why I got you here alone.

481
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,220
Alright, tell me.

482
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,720
I know who took that girl.

483
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,510
Which girl?

484
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,510
Chitti?

485
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,050
Not just Chitti,

486
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,560
I know who took all the girls.

487
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,300
Who?

488
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,510
The one who killed that prostitute
and turned her into Stree.

489
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,350
That's why
he only came back after Stree left.

490
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,340
He laid low until now.

491
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,130
Who is that little girl?

492
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,050
Chitti disappeared.

493
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,470
Then Vicky went missing too.

494
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,970
I'll be damned.

495
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,310
Brother Rudra,

496
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
what if they ran away together?

497
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,100
Never doubt a friend.

498
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,890
But look at the timing.

499
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,220
Brother Rudra,
where's the Chithi (the letter)?

500
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,380
Huh? Chitti is here?

501
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,220
No, Chitti's not here.

502
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,220
You had it.

503
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,550
I had Chitti with me?

504
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,020
Yeah, remember you brought
it up to the rooftop.

505
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:25,920
The rooftop?

506
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:27,180
Yeah, he brought it there,

507
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,220
opened it, showed it to me,

508
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,380
- and then took it with him.
- What?

509
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,970
Oh, I see.
He's talking about the Chithi.

510
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,180
I'm talking about Chitti too.

511
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,390
And I'm talking about the Chithi.

512
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,890
- No, no...
- Why are you talking about Chitti?

513
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,970
Why wouldn't I talk about the Chithi?

514
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,930
Do you have some copyright
over it or what?

515
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,430
Chitti belongs to me,
so of course I'll talk about her.

516
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,510
He's talking about the Chithi.

517
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,420
That's what I'm saying!

518
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,390
- Chitti is mine, why won't I talk about her?
- How can that Chithi belong to you?

519
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,890
- It belongs to him, he has it.
- How can Chitti belong to you?

520
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,390
He's talking about the Chithi!

521
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,510
Chithi - the letter!

522
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,260
"You've got mail!"

523
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,220
Letter, mail, correspondence, missive.

524
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,220
And you're talking about
"I'm your fair lady, get me bangles baby!"

525
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,050
Oh, I see.

526
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,180
T-T-I and T-H-I

527
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,930
- Okay, got it.
- Got it.

528
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,140
I had it. I had received it.

529
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,020
- T-T-I and T-H-I
- I see.

530
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,130
- Give me a second.
- Okay.

531
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,430
What did you think?

532
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,890
I thought that...

533
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,010
I'm not interested in singing lullabies
to your step-girlfriend.

534
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,050
She's not my step-girlfriend!

535
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,060
I just got too emotional, man!

536
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,100
Alright, don't cry. Don't cry.

537
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,010
This is the Chithi, the letter.

538
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,840
We wouldn't have an issue if you were
more familiar with the Hindi alphabets.

539
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,140
It contains the secret
that will tell us who took Chitti.

540
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,470
Then read it quickly.

541
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,510
- May I?
- Brother Rudra,

542
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,090
see what's written in it.

543
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,090
Stree's murderers -

544
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,220
Chandarbhan and the sinful
village council members.

545
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,970
Chandarbhan was the village chief
of Chanderi.

546
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,720
Powerful as a bull, tall as a camel,

547
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,260
and proud like Ravana.

548
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,890
He was a womanizer and a drunk.

549
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,010
Though I'd say drinking
isn't always a bad thing.

550
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,260
Some drink to drown their sorrows,
others to forget about ex-lovers.

551
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,890
As long as it's in moderation...

552
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,100
Brother Rudra,
could you please continue reading?

553
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,220
Yes, of course.

554
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,420
Dushashana was his ideal.

555
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,020
Disrobing women was his hobby for real.

556
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,470
For them, women's duty was to clean up,
keep the family fed,

557
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,420
And warm their beds whenever they said.

558
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,720
Chandarbhan and his friends loved
to watch a prostitute dance.

559
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,020
When that prostitute tried to tie a knot,

560
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,630
these sinners
first slit her lover's throat

561
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,970
and then right in front
of their little girl,

562
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,600
they burnt both of them at one spot.

563
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,380
Then that prostitute came back as Stree,
no wonder,

564
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,890
and she beheaded Chandarbhan
and his friends

565
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,550
and buried them six feet under.

566
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,470
Those headless bodies

567
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,090
still lay buried somewhere.

568
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,100
Oh damn!

569
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,510
Remember the wall at Chitti's place?

570
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,090
Didn't have a head.

571
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,130
Even the pothead said...

572
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,590
What else does it say, Brother Rudra?
Please read.

573
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,470
Give me a minute.

574
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,060
Those headless bodies
still lay buried somewhere,

575
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,430
but nobody knows exactly where.

576
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:15,420
Men used to spend their days eating
carom seeds and lazing around in bed.

577
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,590
- Carom seeds?
- They considered massages

578
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,640
as exercise and pigeons
cradling as an art.

579
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,890
Carom seeds, massages, pigeons?

580
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,390
Looks like the author lost his mind.

581
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,970
The author is trying
to say that after Stree left,

582
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,970
- that headless monster returned
and started taking those girls away.

583
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,010
Yes.

584
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,760
And we all thought our innocent girls
were just skipping town.

585
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,760
You have become quite sharp in my company.

586
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,220
- Thank you.
- Hold on a minute.

587
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,020
How do you know that?

588
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,920
Well...

589
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,220
Well, she told me.

590
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,220
Vicky, please.

591
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,430
She is back, I swear.

592
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,010
Brother Rudra, he's daydreaming again.

593
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,090
- I'm not daydreaming, dummy.
- Really?

594
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,220
If she in fact told you that,
then ask her where he took my Chitti!

595
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,720
In all the excitement,
I forgot to ask her that.

596
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,470
But I'll ask her next time I meet her.

597
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
There's nothing to be excited
about in that.

598
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,890
No, in fact, I'm sad.

599
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,090
Chitti...

600
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,430
"You call for me,"

601
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,550
"And I'll come without a care,"

602
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,770
"I won't be late, I swear,"

603
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,930
You made this in just one day?

604
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,260
Not a whole day - just a few hours,
actually.

605
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,800
You are an amazing artist.

606
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,140
Thank you.

607
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,310
"I'll stop breathing,"

608
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,100
"But my word I'll keep,"

609
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:04,800
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

610
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:14,140
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

611
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:22,880
Even ages seem like moments,
o' my love so true,"

612
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:31,850
"This is how special your love is
for me and you,"

613
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:40,170
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

614
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,810
"You promised long ago, "

615
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,090
"And now you've returned,"

616
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:49,770
"I'm grateful you're here
for my heart has yearned,"

617
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,550
"You're welcome,"

618
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,680
"You're always welcome here,"

619
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,510
"Come and promise
you'll never again disappear,"

620
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:11,100
"It is true love,
that never ends, trust me"

621
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:20,100
"I was, I am,
and yours I'll always be,"

622
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,550
"You promised long ago, "

623
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,770
"And now you've returned,"

624
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,050
"I'm grateful you're here
for my heart has yearned,"

625
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,060
"You're welcome,"

626
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,180
"You're always welcome here,"

627
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,140
"Come and promise
you'll never again disappear,"

628
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,760
- Vicky!
- She bit me!

629
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,380
Hurry up!

630
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,010
- She bit me!
- Vicky!

631
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,050
- Vicky! Vicky!
- My finger!

632
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,390
What happened, Vicky?

633
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,510
What's wrong?

634
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,010
- Love bite.
- Love bite!

635
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,720
Brother Rudra!
Where are you going? Come here.

636
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,600
- Love bite! Love bite!
- What is it?

637
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,890
- Love bite!
- Where is it?

638
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,100
Love bite!

639
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,170
A love bite on a finger?

640
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,800
Where's the love bite?

641
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,970
What?

642
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,130
Well, I got a little carried away so...

643
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,720
She bit me.

644
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,130
Who?

645
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,720
My girl.

646
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,680
Sounds like a repeat performance.

647
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,930
- No! I swear on Daddy!
- Then what?

648
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,680
Candles were burning everywhere,
flowers were raining down.

649
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,510
I was flying around like Superman.

650
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,220
Okay, so then where did the flowers
and candles go?

651
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,890
Where are the candles?

652
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,720
Looks like she packed everything up
and left, huh?

653
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:00,060
I'm sure you must have asked her
where that monster took Chitti, right?

654
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,010
So where did he take her?

655
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,680
Vicky,

656
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,100
honestly, stop daydreaming.

657
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,140
This is no fantasy. It's true.

658
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,930
It's true love.

659
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,060
And where can we find
this true love of yours?

660
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,810
Bittu,

661
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,140
there's a realm beyond right and wrong.

662
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,310
That's where you'll find her.

663
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,050
There's an asylum just
a few blocks from that realm.

664
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,050
That's where we'll find you
in a couple of days!

665
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,350
Idiot!

666
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,680
Hey!

667
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,300
Bittu...

668
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,760
Vicky.

669
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,010
Right.

670
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,760
Vicky,

671
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:41,060
I say this because I'm older and wiser.

672
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,380
What you saw and felt

673
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,390
was just an illusion.

674
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,350
It's not real.

675
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,890
How many more whacks will it take
for you to get that?

676
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,220
Vicky,
we're counting on you

677
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,260
to help us find Chitti.

678
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,260
Come on!

679
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,680
Bittu?

680
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,050
- No, please don't cry.
- Let me go, Vicky.

681
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,140
If you have so much faith in me,
I won't let you down.

682
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,810
I'm Vicky, after all.

683
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,720
I've found a way to get Chitti back
from that headless monster.

684
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,140
What's the plan?

685
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,890
To defeat this headless monster,

686
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,050
we'll have to call Stree back.

687
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,300
Have you lost your mind?

688
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:35,140
"We'll have to call Stree back," he says.

689
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,640
Chanderi got rid
of Stree with great difficulty.

690
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,300
All her power was in her braid
that you had cut off.

691
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,050
So what's the point of calling her then?

692
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,720
Stree can't help us.

693
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,130
She can.

694
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,930
Because she is Stree.

695
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,920
Even without her braid, she's powerful.

696
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,800
She doesn't need the braid to be strong.

697
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,010
So then...

698
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,850
But how will we call her back?

699
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,050
We know someone
who can lead us to Stree.

700
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,180
Anybody home?

701
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,760
What are you staring at?

702
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,720
Jana! Jana! Jana!

703
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,970
I missed you guys so much!

704
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,630
Cut the drama.

705
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,050
We called you so many times.

706
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,100
Sorry, guys.

707
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,600
I used to have seizures.

708
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,970
People thought I was cursed.

709
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,300
So Mom sent me here

710
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,810
and made me delete all contacts.

711
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,140
She made me block your numbers too.

712
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,390
You forget your friends for a woman?

713
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,010
She's my mother, dude.

714
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,430
Sorry.

715
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,760
Jana...

716
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,840
It's time to be a good friend to us now.

717
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,180
Okay?

718
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
Only you can find her now.

719
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,840
Who?

720
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,850
Her!

721
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,340
Her effect still lingers inside you,
correct?

722
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,010
You still get seizures, right?

723
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,260
Yes?

724
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,550
Yes.

725
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,810
- Did you hear that?
- What sound?

726
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,310
- Did you hear that?
- No.

727
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,310
- Are you lying to us?
- No.

728
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,810
- Are you enjoying in private?
- No, man.

729
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,690
- Who is it?
- A special friend, huh? Friendship?

730
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
- No...
- Introduce us, too.

731
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,380
Vicky, please. Vicky, please.

732
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,100
No, dude.

733
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,600
- Tinted room!
- Hear me out...

734
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,720
- Vicky! Here's his lady...
- Hear me out... Don't go in there!

735
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,050
- Your special friend, huh?
- Don't go in there!

736
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,600
- It's my uncle's room. Listen...
- Your special friend!

737
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:48,840
Bhask--

738
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,970
I told you not to go in there.

739
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,140
He took off.

740
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,390
Why don't you ever listen to me?

741
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,180
- You used to be such a scaredy-cat.
- Yes.

742
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,220
How did you end up with
a dangerous dog like that as a pet?

743
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,810
Change, Vicky.

744
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,760
Change is the only constant in this world.

745
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,090
I'm not the same old Jana you knew.

746
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,470
- I'm a changed guy now. For real.
- Don't get all Einstein on us, dude.

747
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,970
Let's talk about why we're here.

748
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,180
What did you want to discuss?

749
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,890
- Well, you see...
- Listen, Jana,

750
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,560
you need to come back to Chanderi with us.

751
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,770
Why?

752
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,260
We need to find Stree.

753
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,850
Has he lost it?

754
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,140
Nah, I have not.

755
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,260
You should do it for Chanderi.

756
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,720
Who in their right mind
would jump into a deadly well?

757
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,760
You got to come with us!
Let's get going.

758
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,170
I need to study for the IAS exam,
got to take care of him.

759
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,680
- To hell with your studies and your dog!
- Did you hear that?

760
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,590
- Bittu! Jana!
- What?

761
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,680
- He's just blowing smoke.
- Yeah, he talks without thinking. Idiot.

762
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,180
- No, we don't need to find Stree.
- Then?

763
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,470
You have a part to play in Stree's play.

764
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,800
- Which play?
- Which play?

765
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,970
The one Brother Rudra's putting on?

766
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,880
- The one where Jana has to be in?
- Yup,

767
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,300
you got to be in Brother Rudra's play.

768
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

769
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,470
- You have an important role in it.
- Yes

770
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,930
- "A special experience."
- Wow.

771
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,140
- For real?
- Yup.

772
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,140
When do I start packing my bags?

773
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,300
Let's go right now.

774
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,600
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

775
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,590
It's in the back. Check there.

776
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:08,890
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

777
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,220
- "I waited all night in the fields"
- What's up?

778
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,180
"but you never came by."

779
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,760
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

780
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,510
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

781
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:24,970
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

782
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:33,560
- Mummy!
- Jana!

783
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,140
- Jana's back! You look great.
- That's enough.

784
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,760
- How have you been?
- I'm doing alright.

785
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,930
- Why'd you come back from Delhi?
- Because of Vicky and Bittu.

786
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,390
- Vicky and Bittu?
- Greetings, Aunty.

787
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,140
- Greetings, Aunty.
- Greetings, Bittu!

788
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,890
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

789
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:52,760
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

790
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,550
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

791
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,720
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

792
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,720
Oh, Jana,
I'm so glad to see you back here.

793
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,060
You still look the same,

794
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,840
like a little cricket.

795
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,220
Thank you, Brother Rudra.

796
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,970
- Cricket!
- Cricket!

797
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,680
Come on, have a seat.

798
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,550
No, not here, go sit over there.

799
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,590
Alright, tell me when do I get
my big moment in the play?

800
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
What play?

801
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,380
Your play.

802
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,510
My play?

803
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Actually, we brought you here
for an important job.

804
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,680
What important job?

805
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,970
Look,

806
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:30,810
there's no need to be scared.

807
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,430
Chanderi's in trouble again.

808
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,720
A dangerous and powerful headless monster

809
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,300
has kidnapped Bittu's step-girlfriend.

810
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,680
No way.

811
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,510
Impossible.

812
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,420
Unbelievable.

813
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:46,010
I couldn't believe it
at first either, Jana.

814
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,350
But it's the truth.

815
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,890
I can accept a headless monster,

816
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,430
but how am I supposed to believe
that Bittu has a girlfriend?

817
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,590
It's a miracle.

818
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,850
Miracles do happen in this world.

819
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,840
Did they even do the "friendship"?

820
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,510
He goes for "friendship",

821
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,430
but just sings her lullabies and leaves.

822
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,390
I'd love to hear that lullaby.

823
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:07,010
Soft Chitti, warm Chitti,
little ball of fur.

824
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,590
- Someone stop him.
- Forget about it. Stop.

825
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,350
The point is,

826
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,880
that this dangerous headless monster
took his girlfriend.

827
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,930
Yes.

828
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:19,800
We need Stree's help to get her back.

829
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,430
And Stree is like a sister to you.

830
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,100
So you'll help us find her.

831
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,720
- No way! Absolutely not!
- We love you.

832
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,130
- Jana!
- I'm not going to help find anyone!

833
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:29,850
- Jana!
- Jana!

834
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,310
No, Brother Rudra, you don't get it.

835
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,720
I have to study for the IAS exams.

836
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,050
- I'm heading back to Delhi.
- Jana!

837
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,470
- Jana!
- Yes?

838
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,880
Look me in the eyes.

839
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,720
- Can you see the truth in them?
- Nah.

840
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,220
Come on, Jana, you can see the truth.

841
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,640
Okay, maybe a little bit.

842
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,130
You don't have to do much.

843
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,100
Disha Batani . (Just guide us.) That's it.

844
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,720
Who is she now?

845
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:48,720
Who's who?

846
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,720
- You just mentioned her.
- Hey! Step side! Move it!

847
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,880
You need to guide us
in the right direction.

848
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,300
No, no, no.

849
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,470
Jana, Stree's effect still lingers in you.

850
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,930
Just tell us where to find her
and we'll handle the rest.

851
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,430
She'll end up handling all of us instead.

852
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,680
There's nothing to be afraid of.

853
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,300
Have I ever let anything
bad happen to you?

854
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,390
You put a frog in my pants
when we were in 5th grade.

855
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,350
Have you forgotten that?

856
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,390
After that?

857
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,100
In 10th grade,

858
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,930
you guys locked me
in the ladies' room and ran off.

859
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,720
After that?

860
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,180
You had me hang upside down
in college to steal a kite.

861
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,390
Where the heck was that kite anyway?

862
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:18,760
- After that?
- After that?

863
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,720
After that?

864
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:20,850
After that?

865
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:21,720
Nothing.

866
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,300
You didn't do anything else after that.

867
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,430
We always step out at night.

868
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:33,510
And I have to lie to my mom.

869
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,550
So what? We are friends, right?

870
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,970
By the way Vicky, you didn't have to lie,
you know?

871
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,140
You committed a sin.

872
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,380
Slow down, Brother Rudra.

873
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:51,810
Ugh,

874
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,010
and now we're back
at this inauspicious place again.

875
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:02,050
You know what, why don't we just come
back here in the morning instead?

876
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,350
- Nah,
- Let's go.

877
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,060
Stree's a nocturnal creature.

878
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,560
She's only going to come out at night.

879
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,890
- Okay.
- Brother Rudra, can I say something?

880
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,680
Come on, Jana,
you've got to save your sister-in-law.

881
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,430
Why do I have to be the one
to do this, though?

882
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,050
She is your younger sister-in-law
after all!

883
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,060
Because there's literally
no one else who can, that's why.

884
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,140
- Alright, let's go.
- Where are we going?

885
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,180
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

886
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,760
Why do I have to lead the way?

887
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,850
- Just go on, lead the way.
- What?

888
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:20,760
- I said, lead the way.
- Why should I have to lead the way?

889
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,010
Just go on, get moving.
Go, call your sister. Call her.

890
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,390
- How do I call her?
- Call her.

891
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,970
Hey Sister?

892
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,850
Stree, my darling sister?

893
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,020
Hello?

894
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,390
Look who's here, Sister.

895
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,680
Call her nicely!

896
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,010
Yes, call her.

897
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,510
"Sister, my darling sister!"

898
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,630
"Sister! My sweet-sweet sister!"

899
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:43,970
Sister...?

900
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,630
Nah, she ain't coming.

901
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,350
She's not going to show up like this.

902
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:50,680
Stree only comes when men are all alone.

903
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,970
Bittu? Brother Rudra?
Can you two come over here for a second?

904
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,510
- Come on.
- No.

905
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:59,640
- This is an adult conversation.
- Okay, you got to step back for this one.

906
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:00,720
- Okay.
- But I'm an adult too, you know!

907
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,380
We'll fill you in on it later.

908
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,640
He's absolutely right.

909
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:09,800
We have to leave him alone if we want Stree
to actually show up and kidnap him.

910
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,180
But what if he scares himself to death?

911
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,680
Nah, he'll be fine.

912
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,050
He's right.

913
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,640
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

914
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,390
So, what were you all talking about, huh?

915
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:19,840
Hey, check it out! A rainbow!

916
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,310
- Where?
- Oh, look at that leaf, it's so green!

917
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,520
Where's the rainbow?

918
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,720
No, there's no rainbow here, silly.

919
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,310
Vicky!

920
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,350
Seriously,
this isn't the time for hide-and-seek!

921
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:35,760
Vicky didn't come with us?

922
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,010
Vicky didn't come with us?

923
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,720
Go check and see where he is.

924
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,430
- Vicky?
- You go check on him.

925
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:43,340
Bittu?

926
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,430
You have the torch. You go check on him.

927
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,890
But I have really bad eyesight, you know.

928
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,720
- You have bad eyesight?
- Yeah.

929
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,340
- Okay, we'll do it together then.
- Sounds good.

930
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,850
Hey, what was that noise?

931
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,470
What noise?

932
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,100
The noise you just made.

933
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,720
No, I didn't.

934
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,380
Where'd that come from?

935
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,300
I heard it too.

936
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,590
Bloody rascals! Left me stranded!

937
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,680
Lied to me about the rainbow!

938
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,520
Vicky! Vicky! Vicky!

939
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,930
Jana!

940
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,640
- Jana!
- Jana!

941
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,050
- Jana!
- Jana!

942
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,310
- Jana!
- Jana!

943
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,640
Hair! Hair! Hair!

944
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,390
- Hair?
- Hair! It touched me.

945
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,720
Wait a second,

946
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,510
you said there was
a rainbow out there, right?

947
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,840
Where exactly was it?

948
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,560
There was one out there, right?

949
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,640
Whose bright idea was it, anyway?

950
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,010
- Bittu?
- Nah, it was all Vicky's idea.

951
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,520
Brother Rudra, I told you this plan
of yours is not looking too good.

952
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,920
Honestly, I didn't expect this from you,
Brother Rudra.

953
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,470
Alright, I'll apologize on his behalf.

954
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,130
Listen up, guys,

955
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:58,880
I know where we can find Ms. Stree.

956
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,180
Then why didn't you tell us sooner?

957
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,050
- I just got the script.
- Okay.

958
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,720
There's a spot around here with
a bunch of statues.

959
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,100
- Okay.
- We have to find that place.

960
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:07,890
Okay.

961
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:09,050
But not alone.

962
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,020
- But we stick together, right?
- No splitting up.

963
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,890
Form a square.

964
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,010
- Form a square.
- Do I have to turn around?

965
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,680
Let's have each other's backs,
and form a square.

966
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
- Just like we used to do when we were kids.
- I know, I know.

967
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,590
- Which way do we have to go? That way?
- No!

968
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,760
- Move anti-clockwise.
- Move anti-clockwise.

969
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,510
- Vicky, give us some direction.
- That way.

970
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:23,760
- Okay.
- That way. Okay.

971
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,880
Easy, Brother Rudra.

972
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:25,930
Don't rush it.

973
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,470
Slow down, I'm an old man!

974
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,630
- You're not that old!
- O' Stree...

975
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,760
Ms. Stree,

976
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,130
I've got some friends here with me.

977
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,760
I am Vicky.

978
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,340
We'd like to have a word with you.

979
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,590
Ms. Stree?

980
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,430
Over here.

981
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,930
- Come stand over here.
- Okay.

982
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,180
And she'll call you from behind.

983
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,890
- Why are we doing this again?
- Oh,

984
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,430
I remember seeing this statue
in the Chanderi Puran.

985
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,380
Did you find out
who sent you those torn pages?

986
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,770
It must've been Mr. Shastri, right?

987
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,420
Mr. Shastri passed away ages ago.

988
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,010
- Huh?
- Oh no.

989
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,420
Jana,

990
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,130
you need to think about Stree--

991
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,130
Huh?

992
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,850
- Jana!
- Jana!

993
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,930
Look, over there! Over there!

994
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:28,840
Oh no!

995
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,850
- Jana!
- Jana!

996
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:30,760
- Jana!
- Jana!

997
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,220
How did he get stuck up there?

998
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,010
Jana! Come on down, Jana!

999
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,430
- Jana!
- Jana!

1000
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,420
- Get down from there!
- He's passed out!

1001
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,890
- Huh? Looks like he's got cataract!
- He's unconscious, look at him!

1002
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,930
- Stree must've hung him up there.
- Oh no.

1003
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,720
We're sorry, Ms. Stree.

1004
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,010
Please forgive us.

1005
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,470
- We apologize.
- Please let our friend go.

1006
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,130
- Okay.
- Ms. Stree, please!

1007
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,640
Jana!

1008
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,850
- Jana!
- Jana!

1009
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:55,340
- Open your eyes, Jana.
- Jana!

1010
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,680
Hey Jana...

1011
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:57,850
Jana?

1012
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,050
Jana? Jana? Wake up. Get up.

1013
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,390
- Jana?
- Jana?

1014
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,930
- Say something.
- Jana?

1015
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,010
Wake up, Jana!

1016
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,720
Brother Rudra, please do something.

1017
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,760
Jana...

1018
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,970
Say something, Jana.

1019
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,140
- He's gone.
- Huh?

1020
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,140
He's gone.

1021
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:17,100
Have you lost your mind?

1022
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:18,350
He's not gone!

1023
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:19,100
Jana!

1024
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,350
Get up, Jana!

1025
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,550
Come on, Jana, get up!

1026
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,140
Open your eyes, Jana! Jana!

1027
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,140
You don't have to find Stree, Jana!
Come on, get up, Jana!

1028
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,800
Come on, get up, Jana! Please, Jana!

1029
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,520
We'll plan a trip to Goa,
we'll go to Goa together...

1030
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,050
Jana...

1031
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,720
Jana...

1032
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,680
Jana, get up!

1033
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,720
Jana...

1034
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,310
Come on, Jana!

1035
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,930
Jana, get up!

1036
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,350
Jana! Wake up!

1037
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:50,720
He's not going to wake up.

1038
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,430
- Jana...
- Jana...

1039
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,010
Jana...

1040
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,590
Run!

1041
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,510
Run!

1042
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,470
This way, Jana! This way!

1043
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,050
This way! We need to go this way!

1044
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,600
Jana is alive!

1045
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,680
Jana! Jana! Jana! Jana!

1046
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,680
You are alive! You are alive!
You are alive, Jana!

1047
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,590
- He is safe!
- We thought you were dead!

1048
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,390
I even gave you a French kiss.

1049
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,430
Thank goodness!

1050
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,340
- We don't have time for this, let's go!
- What for?

1051
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,760
- He's coming!
- Who?

1052
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,170
HE!!!!

1053
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,560
RUN!!!

1054
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,390
- Run!
- Hurry up! Start the bike.

1055
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,350
Hurry up, guys!

1056
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,430
- Come on, Brother Rudra!
- Let's go, guys! Hurry up!

1057
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,640
- Quick, Bittu!
- Yeah, yeah.

1058
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,800
- What's wrong?
- I think we're running out of gas!

1059
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,640
How much did you buy?

1060
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,720
Worth 50 bucks.

1061
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,840
That's hardly enough for a burp!

1062
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:06,060
You cheapskate!

1063
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,430
It's not his fault, Vicky!

1064
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,630
It's his dad's fault.

1065
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,720
Don't drag my dad into this.

1066
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,720
So what do you want us to do?
Drag your bike in this situation!

1067
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,840
- Jana, start pushing.
- Push it.

1068
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,670
Yeah, push it.

1069
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,970
Let's go, guys.

1070
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,840
- Jana...
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

1071
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,850
Let's go, let's go.

1072
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,890
Go, go, go. Hurry up.

1073
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,470
Did you actually see something out there,
or are you just messing with me for kicks and giggles?

1074
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,600
Trust me,
there was definitely someone out there.

1075
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,640
Let's just head back home quickly.

1076
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,050
- Let's go.
- Not home, the fair.

1077
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,350
Let's head to the fair instead.

1078
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,050
Step on it, Bittu! What's wrong?

1079
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,060
What the heck
is that thing behind us, Vicky?

1080
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,560
Look back there.

1081
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,560
What?

1082
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:12,920
What is (that)?

1083
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,800
VICKY!

1084
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,720
Jana! Jana! Behind you!

1085
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,180
What?

1086
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,550
Ouch! He bit me!

1087
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,890
I can't balance.

1088
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:40,010
I'm about to die and you're worried
about the stupid balance!

1089
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,340
We're going to fall!

1090
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:47,310
Let me go! Shoo, let me go!

1091
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,050
Jana, use your elbow!
Hit him with your elbow!

1092
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,850
Mummy! Help me!

1093
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,470
Mummy! Brother Rudra!

1094
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,880
- Here, take this.
- Brother Rudra!

1095
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,520
This is no time to be drinking!

1096
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,630
Throw it at him!

1097
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,970
- Okay, fine.
- Throw it at him!

1098
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,720
I'll throw it at him.

1099
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,300
Take that, you monster!

1100
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,890
- What do I do now?
- Burn him!

1101
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:08,140
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Burn him!

1102
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,890
Dear Lord, I earnestly pray,
please keep all the evil away!

1103
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,050
Burn him!

1104
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,550
Fire!

1105
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,300
Brother Rudra! We did it!

1106
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,970
Vicky! Bittu! Look out!

1107
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,720
What's he doing?

1108
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,130
NOOO!

1109
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,640
Someone's head is stuck in the wheel!

1110
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,680
Stop, Brother Rudra! Wait up!

1111
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,100
Run, Vicky! Run!

1112
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,350
- It's on fire! It's on fire! It's on fire!
- Vicky, don't look behind!

1113
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,890
Run, my brother!
Stop the bike! Stop the bike!

1114
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,020
Stop, stop, stop,
where are you going?

1115
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,630
- Go, go, go!
- Don't look behind.

1116
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,670
Hurry up.

1117
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,430
This way.

1118
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,010
- Turn right.
- Yes, turn right.

1119
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,100
I'm sorry!

1120
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,220
- I'm sorry!
- Jana!

1121
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,470
- I'm sorry!
- Jana!

1122
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,130
Stree, my sister, I'm sorry.

1123
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,100
I'm sorry I came back.
I shouldn't have come back.

1124
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,640
I shouldn't have come back.
I shouldn't have come back.

1125
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,720
I'm such an idiot.

1126
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,470
I'm a fool.

1127
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,970
- I'm so stupid.
- No.

1128
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,680
No, I'm the stupid one. I'm so stupid.

1129
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,140
Why do I always get myself into trouble?

1130
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,680
First the Stree, then the wolf,
and now the head.

1131
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,720
What wolf?

1132
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,630
You came back for your sister-in-law.
You came back to save her.

1133
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,800
Who Sister-in-law? Whose Sister-in-law?

1134
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,970
- To hell with this sister-in-law!
- No, no, no.

1135
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,340
A sister-in-law should be treated
just like a mother.

1136
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,810
- No, I have only one mother.
- Relax.

1137
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:36,600
- Relax.
- Everything's going to be fine, Jana.

1138
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:38,560
There's nothing to be afraid of, okay?

1139
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,770
- No one is going to trouble you, Jana, okay?
- No way.

1140
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,430
We're not going to take you anywhere.

1141
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,680
What?

1142
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,300
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

1143
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,180
He's coming back.

1144
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,010
Who?

1145
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:49,930
HIM!

1146
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:08,470
I told you--

1147
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,800
Vicky?

1148
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:14,970
Vicky? Vicky!

1149
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,140
You guys left me and ran away again!

1150
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,430
What do we do now?

1151
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,100
What?

1152
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,670
- How do we get home?
- What?

1153
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,890
How do we get home?!

1154
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,180
- Don't shout!
- Don't yell!

1155
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,270
- Let's use the elephant.
- Huh?

1156
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:51,840
We'll use this elephant.

1157
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,520
Wrong way.

1158
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,140
- Right.
- No, go left!

1159
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,010
Keep it down.

1160
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,470
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Keep it down.

1161
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,380
- What are you doing?
- What happened?

1162
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:11,850
We have to go left.

1163
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,380
Our left or your left?

1164
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,430
Turn that off.

1165
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,970
Stop that.

1166
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:30,090
Go.

1167
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,090
Go.

1168
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,680
Go see what that is.

1169
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,010
- What happened?
- What is it?

1170
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:53,930
It's the...

1171
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,100
Vicky... check it out.

1172
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,850
I'll check it out! I'll go check it out!

1173
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,140
Nobody is here.

1174
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,680
He was just standing right there!
I swear on my mom!

1175
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,510
- He's there!
- Scaring us for no reason...

1176
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,990
Bow down! Bow down! Bow down!

1177
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,510
Vicky!

1178
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,670
Brother Rudra, he has Vicky!

1179
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,760
He picked him up like a ragdoll!

1180
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,470
- Hold him.
- Let's get him down.

1181
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,310
- Glory to the Goddess!
- Pull him down. Pull him down.

1182
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,140
No, no, no Vicky! Don't go out there!

1183
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,350
- Don't go out there! No, no, no Vicky!
- Where did he go?

1184
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,970
Where did he go?

1185
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,590
Has he left?

1186
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:35,010
Vicky! Vicky!

1187
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,550
Jana...

1188
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:38,640
Take it easy, take it easy.

1189
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,140
- Come on, get up.
- He left.

1190
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,350
Are you hurt?

1191
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,100
- Greetings. Are you okay?
- Thank you for saving us.

1192
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:03,640
OH NOOO!!

1193
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,140
Mummy!

1194
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,350
Mummy!!!!

1195
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,130
Are you okay?

1196
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,930
Mummy!

1197
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,190
He totally smashed it.

1198
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,310
What's that thing exactly?

1199
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,430
A Deadly Corpse.

1200
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,430
A Messenger of Death.

1201
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:00,470
And you, ma'am,

1202
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:06,730
really gave the headless monster a run for his money
with this magical braid of yours.

1203
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,100
Nice work.

1204
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,940
Is this braid hers?

1205
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:14,560
- That...?
- Yes,

1206
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,150
this is Stree's braid

1207
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,020
- that I've been using to boost my powers.
- Oh!

1208
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:25,810
That's how you were able to twirl
it like helicopter blades last night.

1209
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,480
But seriously, Sister,
thanks for last night.

1210
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,560
What?

1211
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,020
- Thank you, Sister.
- Sister?

1212
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,060
Yeah.

1213
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,810
Now that she saved your life,
she's your sister, huh?

1214
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,190
He calls you a witch behind your back.

1215
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,150
And this guy addressing you as 'ma'am'

1216
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,690
calls you an illusion,
an unfaithful lover, and whatnot.

1217
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:43,230
He says that.

1218
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,640
My apologies, ma'am.

1219
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,150
You just disappeared from the bus.

1220
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:49,520
We hadn't heard anything about you
for so long, that's why...

1221
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:51,230
I went to study.

1222
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:53,480
Hear that? She went to study.

1223
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,100
To study black magic.

1224
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,930
To study Black Magic.

1225
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,440
Why'd you get mixed up in Black Magic
and the Red Book stuff?

1226
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:03,640
That doesn't fit your personality at all.

1227
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,810
Anyway, it's time to settle down in life.

1228
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,180
Vicky, now's not the time
to think about all that.

1229
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,970
We need to focus on this headless monster.

1230
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,100
- We have to figure out how to stop him.
- Yes, you're right.

1231
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,680
Only you can stop him.

1232
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,810
You've even taken a course on black magic.

1233
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:23,140
And with your magical braid...

1234
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:28,100
No, my powers are nothing compared to his.

1235
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,850
Last night, you saw how

1236
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:32,890
he picked me up like a ragdoll
and threw me away.

1237
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,640
His powers are at their peak
during the Mahapooja festivities.

1238
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,810
We'll have to stop him
before the very last day, or else...

1239
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,260
Or else what?

1240
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,310
We'll be facing a disaster.

1241
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,100
Argh, you deserve hell
for what you did!

1242
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,390
What kind of friends are you?

1243
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,730
What's wrong? What happened?

1244
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:55,100
Vicky,

1245
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:57,310
my brother,
I haven't slept since last night.

1246
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,560
- Why?
- As soon as I shut my eyelids,

1247
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,100
I see images from that place.

1248
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,510
Which place?

1249
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,850
That place? What place?

1250
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,260
- THAT place!
- Where?

1251
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:06,430
- That place!
- What happened?

1252
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,520
Where?

1253
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,100
- What happened?
- Nah, he means the place you know.

1254
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,680
He just came back from Delhi,
didn't he, Aunty?

1255
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:12,110
So he is having visions of that place.

1256
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,100
The Red Fort, Ring Road, GB Road...

1257
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,430
If that's the only stuff he's seeing,
Why is he so paranoid?

1258
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:18,730
- He didn't sleep a wink last night.
- What's making you lose it, man?

1259
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:20,100
Can you help me get some shut-eye?

1260
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,140
Why would she help you sleep?
Don't make me whack you.

1261
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:23,860
- What the hell is going on with my son?
- Listen, listen, listen!

1262
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,310
Have you got any castor oil on hand?

1263
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,850
Just grab it and dab some on his eyes.

1264
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:30,010
- That will make his vision go away.
- Mummy!

1265
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,100
- But...
- You're doomed, all of you!

1266
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,850
- I mean...
- What kind of friends are you?

1267
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,180
My son was a model student,
studying in Delhi.

1268
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,770
- He would have become an IAS officer!
- Aunty...

1269
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,100
- But you dragged him here
- Aunty...

1270
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,640
and who knows where you took
him that he is so scared.

1271
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,690
He was up all night.

1272
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:46,850
[Gibberish]

1273
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,480
- What the heck?
- Give us two minutes, Aunty. Calm down.

1274
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:52,020
Take a seat.

1275
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:53,520
Sit here.

1276
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:54,850
Sit.

1277
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:14,230
Thank you.

1278
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,260
Now tell us,

1279
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,430
what did you see?

1280
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,480
I saw the place

1281
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:27,140
that the headless monster came from.

1282
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:31,520
What's out there?

1283
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,180
It was a very scary place, Brother.

1284
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,850
That day, I didn't actually die.

1285
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,350
I ended up going there.

1286
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:42,890
It was just darkness all around.

1287
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:44,900
There weren't any leaves
on the trees at all.

1288
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,440
Everything looked all dried up
and withered.

1289
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:49,180
And the rocks were hanging upside down.

1290
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,230
And there was lava, lots of lava.

1291
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,890
Excuse me, Sister? I'm Jana.

1292
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,470
Chitti!

1293
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:02,560
Chitti!

1294
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,760
Who shaved your head?

1295
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:09,060
Chitti's bald!

1296
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,440
Bald?

1297
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,900
They shaved her head, man!

1298
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:17,020
Aw, my Chitti had such amazing silky hair.

1299
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,100
I just got her this fancy shampoo
worth 2500 bucks, what a waste!

1300
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,100
Why'd you have to buy her such
an expensive shampoo anyway?

1301
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:25,930
Come on, Brother Rudra,
love is love, you know.

1302
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:30,900
I can't even imagine
how Chitti must look without hair, it's crazy.

1303
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,720
Stop crying, you big baby.

1304
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:35,150
You're Bittu, not Sneha Kakkar, alright?

1305
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,900
What's his problem with my Chitti,
huh Vicky?

1306
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,190
- What's his issue with her?
- It's not just Chitti,

1307
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:44,260
he's got issues with all the modern girls

1308
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,180
whose thoughts are liberal.

1309
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,730
Hmm.

1310
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:51,180
Most of the girls
who went missing from our town

1311
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,010
were quite modern, you know.

1312
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,060
Correct.

1313
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,270
Yeah.

1314
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,270
Pooja, Poonam, Radhika.

1315
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,970
They had a different way of thinking.

1316
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,730
- Kavita was a taekwondo champion, right?
- Yes.

1317
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:07,560
Nikki used to go to work.

1318
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,760
Yeah.

1319
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,180
And Vidhi had a love marriage
with a guy from another caste.

1320
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,350
- Intercaste marriage, huh?
- Yes.

1321
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:15,100
- Oh.
- Chitti was like them too,

1322
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:16,730
she had so many dreams.

1323
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,560
Not "had", she still HAS dreams.

1324
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,230
Remember, he said he saw them alive?

1325
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:22,770
They're bald, but they're alive.

1326
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,180
- Yes, Brother.
- Thank God.

1327
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,770
If I close my eyes,

1328
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:26,890
I'll see them again,

1329
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:28,230
but I won't do that.

1330
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,760
Perfect.

1331
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:34,190
Alright, then from today,
you're our Sanjay for that hellish place.

1332
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,480
Sanjay Dutt, you mean?

1333
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,560
- Hey, Sanju!
- Sanju!

1334
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:40,810
Were you really trying for the IAS, huh?

1335
01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:42,100
I've been at it for two years.

1336
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,100
That's another issue, I guess,
that I can't seem to clear it.

1337
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,180
No, I mean the Sanjay
from the Mahabharata,

1338
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,900
the one who helped
Dhritarashtra see the war

1339
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,230
through his divine vision!

1340
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,980
Nah, I don't want to show
anyone any divine vision.

1341
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,190
I just want to sleep.

1342
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:54,350
Please, help me out.

1343
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,720
This is no time to sleep, Jana.

1344
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,680
It's time to wake up, got it?

1345
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,190
And Brother Rudra,
it's time to wake everyone up as well.

1346
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:05,360
When we used to write "O Stree (Woman),
come tomorrow" on the wall,

1347
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,690
she would never show up.

1348
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:09,310
Should we try "O Purush (Man),
come tomorrow" now?

1349
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,220
Sister, Stree read it
because she's a woman.

1350
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,930
Do men ever read instructions?

1351
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,110
They pee exactly
where it's explicitly written not to pee.

1352
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,720
But this man is after
the modern girls, right?

1353
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,730
And we're just very simple people.

1354
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,100
Do you watch TV?

1355
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,260
- Yes.
- Listen to music?

1356
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,810
- Yes.
- Are you on social media?

1357
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,140
- Yeah.
- Do you use WhatsApp?

1358
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,860
- Post your pics online?
- Yes.

1359
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,810
Well, you're all on the list then.

1360
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:34,430
But why's he even here, huh?

1361
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,480
To pay his taxes.

1362
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:38,060
- What?
- Yes.

1363
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,440
He is a departed ancestor of Chanderi.

1364
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,020
He is back to reestablish his reign.

1365
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,600
Oh, I see.

1366
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,260
We call upon the Ancestor of Chanderi!

1367
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,810
We call upon the powerful Headless!

1368
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,850
We are here to pay homage to you.

1369
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:56,140
Please come accept the water
we offer you

1370
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,810
and forgive us.

1371
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:01,350
And free this town from your wrath.

1372
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,100
Brother Vicky,
its neckline's a bit too low, fix it up.

1373
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,110
How's this?

1374
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,180
Nah, higher.

1375
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:08,470
Better?

1376
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,270
Will do.

1377
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,310
- Hey! This is a limit.
- We can fight about it later.

1378
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,720
- What's up, Sushma?
- The back's too deep,

1379
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:17,100
add some extra cloth there,
in the sleeves and waist.

1380
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:19,350
But I made this Kareena Kapoor
style blouse just for you!

1381
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:20,260
Like the one from "Bole Chudiyan".

1382
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,480
Fashion's not more important than my life.

1383
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,810
Cover up all the exposed areas quickly.

1384
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:25,100
Like how Nirupa Roy wears them?

1385
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,390
Same to same.

1386
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,230
And I also have...

1387
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:29,520
Yes--

1388
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:31,100
Sister?

1389
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:32,430
Come with me.

1390
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,390
Greetings, Sister.

1391
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,480
To hell with your greetings.
Get up.

1392
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,810
I don't do this stuff.

1393
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:39,270
I have never done "friendship".

1394
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:40,480
Who'd do "friendship" with you anyway?

1395
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,680
- Get up.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

1396
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:44,100
- Come with me without a fuss.
- Sister!

1397
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,310
- Get him on the scooter.
- Where? Huh?

1398
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,890
- Get him on the scooter, quick!
- On this.

1399
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:48,930
I feel sandwiched. Can I drive it?

1400
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,350
Look at him, having a blast.

1401
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,180
Let him have his fun.

1402
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:57,140
When else is he going to get
to have a good time, huh?

1403
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,980
Why are you dragging me into
these sketchy-looking ruins?

1404
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,150
Just come with me,
I'll explain everything.

1405
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,980
Wait a second, is this where you live?

1406
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,140
Let's talk outside, Sister. Please...

1407
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,440
- Come on.
- Sister--

1408
01:12:20,810 --> 01:12:22,020
Aunt Suneeta?

1409
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:23,350
Sister-in-law Anju? Neelam?

1410
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:25,100
What's going on?

1411
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:26,350
Why did you call me here?

1412
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,890
Because you messed up our lives.

1413
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:29,640
Who? Me?

1414
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:30,940
- Yes.
- Yes, you.

1415
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,270
What did I do?

1416
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,270
I was just altering some clothes.

1417
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,810
Why did you have to make
Stree leave Chanderi?

1418
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:38,890
Oh, that!

1419
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,220
Well,

1420
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,270
Ms. Stree would've kidnapped everyone,

1421
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,390
- so I was trying to save everyone's life.
- Not everyone,

1422
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,390
just the men.

1423
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1424
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:50,310
All the men were like tamed cats,

1425
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,140
and we women had so much freedom.

1426
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,980
Then you made Stree leave

1427
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,480
and that headless jerk took her place.

1428
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,850
Sorry, but I didn't know
he'd show up after Stree left.

1429
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,900
It's his own deal,
I can't do anything about it.

1430
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:05,110
Look, you have to fight
that headless monster

1431
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,010
and get our freedom back.

1432
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,310
- Yeah, you're right.
- You'll have to do it.

1433
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:09,470
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

1434
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,060
You have to get rid
of that monster for us.

1435
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:13,110
Have you been hitting the weed or what?

1436
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,220
- Huh?
- Hey!

1437
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,850
Have you even seen him?

1438
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,850
You can't even see him
unless you crane your neck.

1439
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,720
You know how massive he is?

1440
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:20,310
How huge?

1441
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:21,600
Do you have any idea how huge he is?

1442
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,430
How huge?

1443
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,440
Imagine Aamir Khan standing
on top of Mr. Bachchan,

1444
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:26,270
he'd only reach that monster's waist.

1445
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,270
- Oh God.
- Oh no.

1446
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,180
And he's got no head attached.

1447
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,180
He just holds it in his hand.

1448
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,390
And it keeps yelling all day.

1449
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,520
How am I supposed to fight him
with this weak body of mine?

1450
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:44,850
He'll crush me like a bug and eat me.

1451
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:46,980
Then you'll be looking for Vicky forever.

1452
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,270
Just get someone else
to do the alterations.

1453
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,810
Vicky, my son,

1454
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:02,060
just like you made Stree leave,

1455
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:05,890
you have to get rid
of this headless monster too.

1456
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,060
Aunty...

1457
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,640
We're counting on you.

1458
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,520
- Please, don't beg.
- Only you can save us from him, son.

1459
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,640
- Yes, Brother Vicky.
- Yes.

1460
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,400
Long live Brother Vicky!

1461
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,220
Long live Brother Vicky!

1462
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,100
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1463
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,640
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1464
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:20,600
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1465
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,180
- Long live Brother Vicky!
- Hey! No!

1466
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,850
Long live Brother Vicky!

1467
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,930
Long live the protector of Chanderi!

1468
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,850
Long live Brother Vicky!

1469
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:34,850
Long live Brother Vicky!

1470
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:37,390
I think the women are right on this one,
Vicky.

1471
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,230
It's time for you to do or die.

1472
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,730
You want me dead or what?

1473
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:40,730
Vicky,

1474
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,350
you should think about fighting
that monster instead of running away.

1475
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,390
Huh?

1476
01:14:46,730 --> 01:14:47,690
Fight him?

1477
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,680
Come on, how can I fight him?

1478
01:14:51,230 --> 01:14:53,400
Even you couldn't fight him
with that braid thing.

1479
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,020
You forget what Mr. Shastri said?

1480
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,310
In his eyes, love shines.

1481
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:01,720
Right.

1482
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,190
A true artist defined.

1483
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,190
Vicky,

1484
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,310
you're the protector of this town.

1485
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,230
Bingo! She's right.

1486
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:15,180
Every superhero has special powers.

1487
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:17,060
Like Arjuna never missed his mark.

1488
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:19,310
Like Bheem had his insane strength.

1489
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:24,140
Your strength is in your eyes,
the love in them.

1490
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:31,270
Trust yourself.

1491
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,020
If you could stop Stree,

1492
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:36,270
you can beat this headless monster as well.

1493
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:38,520
Look him in the eyes

1494
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,180
and stab him
with this dagger right in the chest.

1495
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,230
- That's it?
- That's it.

1496
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,310
No way, no way!

1497
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:49,850
How can I beat him?

1498
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,520
What's wrong with these women?
Who do they think I am?

1499
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,770
I'm just a tailor, not some superhero.

1500
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,220
I've seen him.

1501
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,850
- I can't do it.
- You can do it.

1502
01:15:57,930 --> 01:15:59,390
- No way, no way.
- You can do it, Vicky. You can.

1503
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,400
She's right.

1504
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,150
Only you can save Chanderi, Vicky.

1505
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,350
- But...
- Yes.

1506
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,060
You know,

1507
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,850
I haven't slept well
since Chitti disappeared.

1508
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,350
You can do it.

1509
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,400
Nah.

1510
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:18,470
Vicky...

1511
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:32,350
But how do we get this headless
monster to show up?

1512
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,600
Well, he was a womanizer.

1513
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:36,770
He likes booze and dance shows.

1514
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:39,220
So, we'll organize a dance show.

1515
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:40,520
But the problem is,

1516
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,390
who would agree to dance there?

1517
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,230
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's a huge issue.

1518
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,720
No local girl would dare dance there.

1519
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,890
They are all terrified.

1520
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,220
I know a dancer.

1521
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,980
She's not from Chanderi, an outsider.

1522
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:55,390
Not her. Someone else.

1523
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:57,230
- Who?
- But...

1524
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,810
why would an outsider
risk her life for us?

1525
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:00,810
Not for you.

1526
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:01,600
Then?

1527
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,640
For me.

1528
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,520
- For you?!
- For you?!

1529
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,230
For me.

1530
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:10,190
- "Love is crazy and wonderful at the same time."
- Stop, stop, stop.

1531
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:11,270
Perfect.

1532
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,400
Come with me. Don't be scared.

1533
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,230
Who's this dancer
that Brother Rudra knows, huh?

1534
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:18,220
I would like to meet your boss.

1535
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,600
And who do we have here?

1536
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,270
He doesn't like to brag about himself.

1537
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,060
Tell my flame her moth seeks her.

1538
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,270
Wait here.

1539
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,980
- Brother Rudra?
- Hmm?

1540
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,760
You dyed your beard, I see.

1541
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,610
And you put on some fancy
'David-On' perfume too.

1542
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,680
Nice.

1543
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:43,270
"The flame tells the moth,"

1544
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:47,100
"Go away, please,"

1545
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:50,720
"You'll burn like me,"

1546
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:54,150
"Don't come here, please."

1547
01:17:54,230 --> 01:18:01,690
He doesn't listen for he desires to burn.

1548
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,640
Aw, you haven't changed a bit,

1549
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,140
my innocent prince.

1550
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,980
The same goes for you,

1551
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,230
my beauty queen.

1552
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:14,470
What have you been up to, Rudra?

1553
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,850
Well, you loved books

1554
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:19,650
so I decided
to surround myself with books.

1555
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:21,980
So, what are you now a junk collector?

1556
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:23,720
Books and emotions
both have the same fate

1557
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:27,020
for those who don't know
their true worth consider it junk.

1558
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:28,400
Jana? Bittu?

1559
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,440
Go.

1560
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,140
- Where?
- Where?

1561
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,850
To jump into the well
and drown in shame.

1562
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,520
Let's go.

1563
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:37,150
I am here to ask for a favor, Shama.

1564
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,060
You can ask for my life.

1565
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:48,180
I want you to do a dance performance
in Chanderi, please.

1566
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,190
So, you are indeed here
to ask for my life.

1567
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,100
You have my word, Shama,

1568
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,980
no harm will come to you.

1569
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:58,310
Ms. Shama, please?

1570
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:03,100
Do this for me?

1571
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,400
Fine.

1572
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,390
Gone are the days when the moth
would die for the flame,

1573
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,350
This flame will put her life at risk

1574
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,520
for the moth today and change the game.

1575
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,970
- Amazing.
- Well said.

1576
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,400
Go tell everyone in Chanderi.

1577
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,640
Won't you come along?

1578
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:25,190
No, I'll come with her.

1579
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:27,640
- This is not right, Brother Rudra.
- Okay, perfect.

1580
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,650
- Let's go.
- But...

1581
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,110
Thank you.

1582
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:36,020
"Just marvel from afar,
for you can't touch this star."

1583
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:39,900
"For you can't touch this star."

1584
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,360
She has come for real.

1585
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:44,270
My Shama.

1586
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:59,430
"Give your arms a rest, my love."

1587
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:08,020
"Give your arms a rest, my love."

1588
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:16,100
"Behold this beauty with your
eyes tonight requests your dove."

1589
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:25,010
"Behold this beauty with your
eyes tonight requests your dove."

1590
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:29,970
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1591
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:34,140
"For my ruin is certain tonight,
my sweetheart."

1592
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:38,270
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1593
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:42,480
"For my ruin is certain tonight,
my sweetheart."

1594
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,430
Vicky, where is she?

1595
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,480
She must be stuck somewhere,
that poor thing.

1596
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:49,850
Damn it.

1597
01:20:55,310 --> 01:21:03,850
"My darling,
try to see the delicacy of the scene."

1598
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:11,860
"You cannot purchase
a lady's consent I mean."

1599
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:20,230
"You cannot purchase
a lady's consent I mean."

1600
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:23,190
"Don't feel so proud,"

1601
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:28,600
"My love,"

1602
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,190
See if you can figure out
if that headless monster is around.

1603
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,730
I'm not sure if I can manage that,
to be honest.

1604
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,720
- Give it a try, at least give it a shot.
- Alright, I'll give it a go.

1605
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,140
"--eyes tonight requests your dove."

1606
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,440
Brother Rudra,
he's somewhere nearby. He's close by.

1607
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,650
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1608
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:56,440
Vicky!

1609
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,150
"For my ruin is certain tonight,
my sweetheart."

1610
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:04,230
"Take my life if you so desire,
my darling."

1611
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,890
"For my ruin is--"

1612
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,720
What happened?

1613
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,230
Why's the power out?

1614
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:12,230
Vicky! Bittu!

1615
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,850
Brother Rudra! What do we do?

1616
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:14,890
Quick, hide Ms. Shama!

1617
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:15,480
Okay.

1618
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,180
Surround her. Surround her.

1619
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:19,060
Surround her, hurry!

1620
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,440
Hey!

1621
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,690
- He's here. He's here.
- Hide.

1622
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,100
Bittu?

1623
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,100
Yeah?

1624
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,650
Make sure Ms. Shama stays protected,
alright?

1625
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:55,310
Okay.

1626
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,060
Be careful, Vicky.

1627
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,600
Vicky...

1628
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,640
Vicky's going over there.
He's walking towards him.

1629
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,060
He'll be fine.

1630
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,060
He's the protector of this town.

1631
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,560
Vicky, my friend...

1632
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:13,060
Daddy...

1633
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,680
'Look him in the eyes'

1634
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:19,100
'and stab him
with this dagger right in the chest.'

1635
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:20,270
Where are you?

1636
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,180
We'll have to do something,
Brother Rudra.

1637
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:23,690
There's nothing we can do.

1638
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,690
Whatever needs to be done,
Vicky will take care of it.

1639
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:26,810
Vicky...

1640
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,220
Where...

1641
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,970
where's your head?

1642
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:37,180
You were supposed to look into my eyes.

1643
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:38,980
You should leave.

1644
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:40,970
I'll kill you.

1645
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,350
You need to leave.

1646
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:46,060
I'll really kill you.

1647
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,770
I'm the protector of Chanderi.

1648
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:50,520
You...

1649
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,230
Brother Rudra, Vicky...!
Brother Rudra, let me go!

1650
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,400
No, no, no!

1651
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:31,270
Help!

1652
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,640
Momma!

1653
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,440
Help!

1654
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,980
Help!

1655
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,180
Let me go.

1656
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,060
I have no reason to live anymore.
He took Shama away.

1657
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,640
Don't say that, Brother Rudra.

1658
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:00,100
Oh God!

1659
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,480
No!

1660
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,480
Brother Rudra!

1661
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,060
- Go.
- Are you okay?

1662
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:07,810
Vicky...?

1663
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:08,810
Vicky...?

1664
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:10,650
Get up, get up.

1665
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:13,480
What's wrong with you?

1666
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,720
What's wrong?

1667
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:18,350
I...I don't know.

1668
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,600
I was about to stab him
with the dagger...

1669
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,140
Okay.

1670
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:22,650
Then he brought his head forward

1671
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:24,230
and everything got foggy.

1672
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:25,890
I know, I saw.

1673
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:28,350
Bittu? Where's Bittu?

1674
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:51,940
- Bittu!
- Bittu!

1675
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,270
Why aren't you answering our calls?

1676
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:55,640
What are you doing here?

1677
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:57,440
I've had a realization
and my eyes have been opened.

1678
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,520
No, your eyes have changed.

1679
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,230
You should change too.

1680
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:03,150
Or else...

1681
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,110
Or else what?

1682
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,310
What will you do?

1683
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,810
Or you'll get beaten up
just like this drum.

1684
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:12,260
That headless monster seems
to have them under his control.

1685
01:26:12,350 --> 01:26:13,310
Yes.

1686
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,940
No, your eyes seem to be fine.

1687
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,350
He has divine powers.

1688
01:26:22,930 --> 01:26:24,430
Opposing him

1689
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,980
is like trying to throw sand over the sun.

1690
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:31,060
That poor guy lost his head.

1691
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,430
He lost his head.

1692
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:38,270
Yet he's protecting our culture.

1693
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,810
The headless man is here!

1694
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:44,310
The headless man is here!

1695
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:48,980
All the females should stay home.

1696
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:52,230
The headless man can show up
anywhere anytime.

1697
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:55,810
All the females should stay home.

1698
01:26:55,890 --> 01:26:59,140
The headless man can show up
anywhere anytime.

1699
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:01,060
Vicky...

1700
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:02,770
You?

1701
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,560
Are you okay?

1702
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:08,060
Where have you been all this time?

1703
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,060
Where did you disappear
to at the last moment?

1704
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:13,440
That monster has like over
a hundred men acting just like him.

1705
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,310
And he took Ms. Shama with him too.

1706
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:16,730
Now you show up here.

1707
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,400
Where were you?

1708
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,730
Why didn't you come there?

1709
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:24,180
I... I was trying to get
to where that headless monster came from.

1710
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:26,190
Why?

1711
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,930
I thought I'd try and free
all the girls while he was busy here.

1712
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,520
But I couldn't get in there.

1713
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,930
You are lying, aren't you?

1714
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,010
Trust me.

1715
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,180
How do I trust you?

1716
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:42,850
I really don't know much about you.

1717
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,600
I don't even know your name
or where you live.

1718
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,310
You just come and go as you please.

1719
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:48,310
I have no idea about your family
or what they do.

1720
01:27:48,390 --> 01:27:49,930
Are you a mountain person
or a beach person?

1721
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,690
Vegetarian or non-vegetarian?
What's your past?

1722
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:53,730
Why did you take Stree's braid?
Why did you disappear from the bus?

1723
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,100
I'm clueless about all of it.

1724
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,180
But you seem to know everything about me.

1725
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,100
You know I'm Vicky, I live with my dad,

1726
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,260
I don't have a mom,
I'm a ladies tailor and I studied home science.

1727
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,060
I love the mountains and I love you--

1728
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,260
I am a crazy fool.

1729
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:10,770
Look, Vicky,
I want to tell you everything about myself.

1730
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:13,270
I've tried many times but couldn't.

1731
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,730
Now is your chance, so tell me.

1732
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,680
There's no better time than right now.

1733
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,150
I'm all ears.

1734
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:20,690
You won't be able to hear it.

1735
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:23,940
Whatever relationship we have,

1736
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,100
it'll end the day I tell you the truth.

1737
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,890
Relationship?

1738
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:33,400
What relationship do we even have, anyway?

1739
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,300
It's like a firefly and light,

1740
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,390
a flower and dew,

1741
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,190
a deer and musk -

1742
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,850
a bond between souls.

1743
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:49,480
It's beyond your understanding.

1744
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,680
It's beyond time itself.

1745
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:55,270
Woah, beyond time?

1746
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,310
Vicky...

1747
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:00,730
Vicky!

1748
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,940
- What is it?
- Come down, quick!

1749
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,140
Coming!

1750
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:06,850
- I'll die. I'll die.
- What are you doing?

1751
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:08,600
- Take care of yourself...
- What is it? What's wrong?

1752
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,520
- What happened?
- Look at his condition.

1753
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:11,720
You...

1754
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,190
You decided to show up today?

1755
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,690
- Where have you been, Sister?
- Jana...

1756
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,350
- Do you know what happened yesterday?
- Jana...

1757
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:18,510
We had a heart-to-heart chat.

1758
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,600
It's not her fault.

1759
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:20,390
Brother Rudra, what's wrong?

1760
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:21,720
Are you having a stroke?

1761
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:23,190
- No... no.
- Are you feeling okay?

1762
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,850
- What happened?
- I'm disturbed,

1763
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:26,480
really disturbed.

1764
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,190
There's like a volcano
of emotions inside me.

1765
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:31,900
I feel so guilty and ashamed.

1766
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,230
Shama...

1767
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:34,730
No.

1768
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:37,310
I had promised her

1769
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,230
no harm would come to her.

1770
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,810
- And I'll keep that promise.
- Okay.

1771
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,930
Even if the moth has
to sacrifice himself today,

1772
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,020
he will reignite the flame.

1773
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,390
- Don't say that.
- Don't get all dramatic on us, Brother Rudra.

1774
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,100
Show him what you came here for.

1775
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,850
What? I had come to show him my pain.

1776
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,760
Did you forget about that document?
He's impossible.

1777
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:56,680
- What is this?
- This...

1778
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:59,930
I got a link that might help us solve
the headless monster's puzzle.

1779
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:00,940
Have a look at this.

1780
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,520
The person who sent the warning

1781
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:08,180
knew the monster would
show up after Stree left.

1782
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:12,480
He might have more information
on that headless monster.

1783
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,690
He might also know

1784
01:30:14,770 --> 01:30:17,190
how to get to where the monster lives.

1785
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:19,810
Well, whatever you need to find out,
you better hurry.

1786
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,220
Otherwise, this monster's going
to set Chanderi back 200 years.

1787
01:30:22,310 --> 01:30:23,640
Brother Rudra, I asked you

1788
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:25,190
to find out who sent that letter.

1789
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:29,150
I couldn't find that out,
but I found out where it was from.

1790
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,560
Look at this stamp.

1791
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:33,680
- Give them the...
- Here.

1792
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:37,350
- Men--
- Mental Asylum, Bhopal.

1793
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,150
Give me your hair!

1794
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:40,800
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1795
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,310
Baldy is pulling my hair!

1796
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:45,100
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1797
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,390
Give me your hair!

1798
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:53,060
Chanderi?
Is anyone from Chanderi out here?

1799
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:54,640
No, nothing.

1800
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,520
Is anyone from Chanderi out here?

1801
01:30:59,140 --> 01:30:59,850
Protect your hair.

1802
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,810
Anyone?

1803
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,930
Is anyone from Chanderi out here?

1804
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,230
He is coming.

1805
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:05,730
- He is coming?
- He is coming.

1806
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:11,140
Stand up, show respect and be alert.

1807
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,770
King of kings,

1808
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:17,600
Emperor of emperors,

1809
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:21,520
The defender and decider of the faith,

1810
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:26,190
King of India the Great,
Get locked up before it's too late,

1811
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:29,180
Husband to Mumtaz Mahal,

1812
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:32,350
Builder of the Taj Mahal,

1813
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,650
For now and forever

1814
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:39,060
Shah Jahan is blessing us
with his presence!

1815
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,260
Let's get started.

1816
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:44,310
Hey!

1817
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:46,520
He's from Udaybhan's family.

1818
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,480
Look at him.

1819
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:49,730
Minister!

1820
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:50,770
Your Highness.

1821
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,300
What's the update
on Taj Mahal's construction?

1822
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:55,390
There's a shortage of marbles,
Your Highness.

1823
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,940
You need to hurry.

1824
01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:01,520
My wife's soul will keep "roaming"
till we don't finish its construction.

1825
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:02,930
Astrologer,

1826
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:07,020
tell me - whose body does
my wife's soul possess these days?

1827
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:11,680
In him, Your Highness.

1828
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:13,400
- What are you doing, Brother Rudra?
- Her soul is in him.

1829
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,480
- Vicky?
- Yes, it's in him.

1830
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,230
Come on.

1831
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:17,560
No, it's not.

1832
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,770
It's not.

1833
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:22,140
What is he looking at?

1834
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:24,600
Mumtaz,

1835
01:32:25,350 --> 01:32:28,810
couldn't you find anyone better
than this mushroom of a person?

1836
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:31,060
What's wrong with your taste?

1837
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,390
Well, I had COVID, you know.

1838
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:33,680
Good Lord!

1839
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,930
Come here, I'll give you the vaccine!

1840
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,110
- What will you give me?
- Go.

1841
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,350
- Go, go, go.
- Go on.

1842
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:39,390
Come here.

1843
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,850
Not there, sit on my lap.
That's where you'll get it.

1844
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,680
- He's going to give me a vaccine.
- Just take it, man.

1845
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:44,940
How are you, my Momo?

1846
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:45,810
Momo?

1847
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:48,180
I guess that's Mumtaz's pet name.

1848
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:50,230
Tell me,
where did you go leaving me all alone?

1849
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:51,230
Chanderi.

1850
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:53,390
She went to Chanderi,
I mean, I went to Chanderi.

1851
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,600
That place is in big trouble.

1852
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,890
The headless monster
has started causing havoc then?

1853
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:02,940
You knew about it?

1854
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:07,600
Dismissed!

1855
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:12,310
Dismissed!

1856
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,690
Leave.
Please leave.

1857
01:33:16,890 --> 01:33:18,220
Everyone, please leave.

1858
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,350
Yes.

1859
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:20,550
Let's go.

1860
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:22,100
Where are you going, Momo?

1861
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:23,270
You stay here.

1862
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:24,720
Don't you dare!

1863
01:33:24,810 --> 01:33:27,100
Don't you dare call me Momo
or kiss me anywhere!

1864
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,720
You wretched woman!

1865
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:35,850
Calm down, Your Highness.
Calm down.

1866
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:38,060
I'm just saying

1867
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:40,930
the Iss Mahal will cost a fortune.

1868
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:44,640
Why not build a public toilet instead?

1869
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,850
A public toilet made of marble?
That's just weird.

1870
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:49,180
People will come and pee
all over our symbol of love.

1871
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,680
Ugh, gross.

1872
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,310
Do you love me, my dear?

1873
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,810
Yes, I do.

1874
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:57,310
Then tell me,

1875
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:00,140
what do you know
about that headless monster?

1876
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:08,680
That headless monster
is an ancestor of mine.

1877
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,770
I have his foul blood in my veins.

1878
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:16,680
That's why you tore those pages
from the Chanderi Puran.

1879
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:20,400
But I sent them back with a warning.

1880
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,470
- He will come back.
- Yes.

1881
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:24,770
He will come back.

1882
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:26,720
But you didn't tell us

1883
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,560
how to deal with this monster
when he comes back.

1884
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:32,470
You just left us to fend for ourselves
with just a warning.

1885
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,350
Your Highness,

1886
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:36,930
you gave us the warning,
didn't you? So tell us,

1887
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,810
how can we defeat this headless monster.

1888
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:44,890
My Queen, I would've gone myself,

1889
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:47,480
to defeat him but

1890
01:34:47,770 --> 01:34:50,650
I keep slipping off elephants these days

1891
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:52,800
because of balancing issues.

1892
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:54,270
Listen,

1893
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:57,260
that monster has kidnapped girls
from our town,

1894
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,930
including Chitti and our Shama.

1895
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,390
Hey... She's mine.

1896
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,690
- My Shama.
- Yeah, yeah, his Shama.

1897
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:06,190
He kidnapped her right
in front of everyone.

1898
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,060
He's even messed with the minds
of every single man in Chanderi.

1899
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:10,690
They've all gone completely bonkers.

1900
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,800
If you know anything that can help us,
please tell us.

1901
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:16,720
Otherwise, our whole town
of Chanderi is doomed.

1902
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,140
Please, my darling.

1903
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:22,680
You have to help us,
for the sake of our love!

1904
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:29,390
In a realm that dwells
in the shadows of the town.

1905
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,350
He can be dealt with only
in his home ground.

1906
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:36,310
Neither by a human nor an animal,
it can be reached.

1907
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,730
Neither by a man nor a woman
it can be breached,

1908
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:41,890
To enter in you have
to be an equal part of each.

1909
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:44,510
But he won't stop nor will his havoc

1910
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,800
Until he does not get what he wants -

1911
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:50,390
A sacrifice!

1912
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:51,690
Sacrifice who?

1913
01:35:51,810 --> 01:35:53,060
Sacrifice a female.

1914
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:55,060
Sacrifice Stree!

1915
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,230
Sacrifice a female.

1916
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:01,470
But if Ms. Stree's not there,
then who's he going sacrifice?

1917
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,690
He's got a whole bunch
of females with him -

1918
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:04,310
He's got my Shama, Chitti,
and other females too.

1919
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:05,770
- Oh shit!
- Oh no!

1920
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:07,930
Today's the last day
of the Mahapooja festivities.

1921
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,520
If we don't do something today,
he's going sacrifice all those women.

1922
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:13,770
We have to find a way to get into
his house, no matter what it takes.

1923
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,230
So what do we know about
this headless monster?

1924
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:18,180
That it doesn't have a head.

1925
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:19,470
Nice work.

1926
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,770
Let's make him an IAS officer right away!

1927
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,390
- Thank you, Brother Rudra.
- Shut up.

1928
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:26,060
What a useless person.

1929
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,600
He can influence people.

1930
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,680
He's changed everyone's minds.
He has influenced them.

1931
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:31,770
What do you mean?

1932
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:34,100
So this headless monster
is basically an influencer.

1933
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,680
He wants to grow his followers.

1934
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:39,020
His powers are in his body,

1935
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:41,310
but it's controlled by the head.

1936
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:43,810
So if we separate the head from the body,

1937
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:44,930
the head will be left helpless.

1938
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,230
Then we can quietly go

1939
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:48,930
and chop it off.

1940
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:50,940
No, not we, Brother, you have to do it.

1941
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,310
You're the protector of this town.

1942
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,430
Yes, right.

1943
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,650
But that's only possible if we reach
the hellish place where he lives.

1944
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,310
And nobody can go there.

1945
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:01,060
Neither humans nor animals.

1946
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:03,680
Hey, I've got another idea!

1947
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,350
Plan B.

1948
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:05,470
We haven't even made Plan A yet
and you're already onto Plan B?

1949
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,560
No, Vicky, what I meant was...

1950
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,270
- Stop.
- Stop it.

1951
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,560
Remember what he said.

1952
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,800
Neither by a man nor a woman
can it be breached,

1953
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:15,680
To enter, you have to have
equal parts of each.

1954
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:17,390
Neither by a man nor a woman
can it be breached,

1955
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:18,930
To enter,
you have to have equal parts of each.

1956
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,930
Hey...

1957
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:22,230
You have to have equal parts of each.

1958
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,480
Let's send Jana then.

1959
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:25,020
What do you mean, Vicky?

1960
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,310
Are you saying I'm half man
and half woman?

1961
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:27,930
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- No, no, no,

1962
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:29,390
I've seen Jana when he was a kid.

1963
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:30,260
What did you see?

1964
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:31,270
What did you see, Brother Rudra?

1965
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,480
I have a lot of respect for you.

1966
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,890
That's no way to talk to me.

1967
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,270
I came all the way
from Delhi just for you guys.

1968
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,520
I even died for three minutes.

1969
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,150
That loafer kept calling me Momo,

1970
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,050
but you didn't stop him.

1971
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,180
- Jana!
- Sister, did you hear what he's saying?

1972
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:40,850
What?

1973
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:42,600
You still have Stree's
lingering effect in you.

1974
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,180
So you have a small
Feminine part inside you. That's why...

1975
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,690
You're saying I have female
parts inside me!

1976
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:47,730
Why don't you just say
you want me to die?!

1977
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:48,730
SILENCE!

1978
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:51,720
Half man, half woman,

1979
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:54,720
I think he was talking
about Ardhanarishvara.

1980
01:37:56,060 --> 01:37:56,980
I see.

1981
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:58,480
Oh, Ardhanarishvara,

1982
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,850
the union of Lord Shiva and Shakti.

1983
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:05,520
Neither a female nor a male can break
the reign of the headless monster.

1984
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:08,600
For that, a man and a woman
will have to become one.

1985
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:09,600
But how?

1986
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:10,930
Leave that to me.

1987
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:13,690
You just think about cutting off his head.

1988
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,350
In one strike.

1989
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,140
One strike?

1990
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,180
May I have your kind attention, please!

1991
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:51,520
The upcoming Mahapooja's veneration

1992
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,640
will be conducted solely by men.

1993
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:06,060
Women are kindly requested
to remain at home for this event.

1994
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:19,650
Perfect.

1995
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,510
Now you look like a real prince indeed.

1996
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:33,270
Vicky?

1997
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,850
Where are you all going,
leaving me by myself?

1998
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,100
You came here to save those girls,
didn't you?

1999
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:41,760
- You won't be able to save them.
- Hey...

2000
01:39:41,890 --> 01:39:43,020
It's just not possible.

2001
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,560
- Go on.
- Go.

2002
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,890
Watch your step.

2003
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:49,100
Hey Bittu...

2004
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:51,010
- Cut it out, Bittu.
- Hey!

2005
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,350
- No.
- Walk properly.

2006
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:53,850
Why did we even bring him along?

2007
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:57,010
Remember we had brought you
along even when you were growling?

2008
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:58,430
- Yeah.
- He's our friend.

2009
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,890
And anyway,
we need one of his men with us.

2010
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:01,890
Why is that?

2011
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:03,480
What if we need to give
and take something?

2012
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:04,640
- Yes.
- Give and take what?

2013
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:06,140
And Jana,

2014
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:09,190
if we take too long to get back then...

2015
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:10,930
Then what? Kill him?

2016
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,110
No, no, no!

2017
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:14,100
Just handle it as you see fit.

2018
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,720
- Okay, fine.
- You'll die! You'll die!

2019
01:40:16,810 --> 01:40:19,890
Brother Rudra, make him on the bed.
Just make him sit there.

2020
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:21,470
You've lost all your manners, Bittu.

2021
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:23,890
- What are you going to do, huh?
- Quiet.

2022
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,060
Don't worry about him, Vicky.

2023
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,140
Brother, when you go in,

2024
01:40:28,270 --> 01:40:30,190
no matter what happens,
don't be scared.

2025
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,140
I've got your back.

2026
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:33,640
And I've got a Plan B.

2027
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:35,350
Spell out B for me, will you?

2028
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:36,680
B?

2029
01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:37,900
- Yeah, B...
- B...

2030
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:40,220
- Vicky!
- Yeah?

2031
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:42,640
- We need to hurry.
- Right.

2032
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,180
I'm ready. I'm ready.
Brother Rudra...

2033
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,480
- Here.
- Yes.

2034
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:47,350
Go and be victorious.

2035
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:49,350
Be the force with you.
(May the force be with you.)

2036
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,100
Just let Shama know
I came here with you.

2037
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,390
- Yeah, I'll let her know. I'll let her know.
- Vicky...

2038
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:55,260
Vicky...

2039
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,100
- Stop.
- Okay, now tell me what we need to do.

2040
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,190
We have to go through this wall.

2041
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,270
- This wall?
- Hmm.

2042
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:06,550
But we didn't bring a drill with us.

2043
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,640
- So how are we going get through it?
- We'll manage.

2044
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,350
We'll have to become one
to cross that wall.

2045
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:12,810
- Huh?
- Yes.

2046
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:15,810
Here? In front of everyone?

2047
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:17,720
Yes.

2048
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:19,260
Let's go.

2049
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:21,140
Okay, okay, okay.

2050
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,470
What does she mean by "become one"?

2051
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:26,480
Well...

2052
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,560
I got it. I got it.

2053
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:28,770
Can you guys...

2054
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:30,270
Come here, Vicky.

2055
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,060
Yes, I'm ready.

2056
01:41:36,810 --> 01:41:38,060
Hey, you can't watch.

2057
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:40,350
I'm ready.

2058
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:41,600
Get closer.

2059
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,560
Even closer.

2060
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,890
Even closer?

2061
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,810
Closer.

2062
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:21,220
She possessed him!
She has taken over my brother's body!

2063
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,560
Mystical powers! Mystical powers!

2064
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,390
She has taken over Vicky's body!

2065
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,390
She is taking my brother away,
Brother Rudra!

2066
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:30,220
She is taking my brother through
the wall, Brother Rudra!

2067
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,640
- Mystical powers!
- Vicky!

2068
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:38,150
Brother Rudra?

2069
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:42,770
Where did he go, Brother Rudra?

2070
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:45,390
She has mystical powers.
Did you break your nose?

2071
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,050
Hello?

2072
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,140
Are you really inside me?

2073
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:57,640
This is the first time

2074
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:00,100
I've had such close contact with someone.

2075
01:43:26,220 --> 01:43:27,140
What were you doing?

2076
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:28,300
I was just...

2077
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,390
Nothing.

2078
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:33,390
Sorry.

2079
01:43:35,180 --> 01:43:36,890
But how did you even
pull off this miracle?

2080
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,300
You entered my body,

2081
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:40,140
then we crossed the wall,
and now you stepped out.

2082
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:41,300
Shh, Vicky.

2083
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,650
Don't worry, I'm here with you.

2084
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:54,140
It's so dark in here.

2085
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,140
Let's wait right here. He'll come.

2086
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:59,680
Let's go.

2087
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:15,390
Oh, damn! What is this place?

2088
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:19,640
I'm sure no one in the Chanderi Tourist Department
knows about this place.

2089
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:21,810
It could really boost tourism
in Chanderi--

2090
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:32,980
Did you see that?

2091
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:37,020
It's... molten lava.

2092
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:54,180
Over there.

2093
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,560
Aren't those the missing girls
from Chanderi?

2094
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,770
Go...

2095
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:02,220
and save those women.

2096
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:04,430
Okay.

2097
01:45:04,970 --> 01:45:06,550
Come on, let's go save them.

2098
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,890
Not me.

2099
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:10,020
Just you.

2100
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,560
And why not you?

2101
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,810
Vicky, the headless monster
doesn't want to sacrifice those girls.

2102
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,720
He wants to sacrifice me.

2103
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:20,810
What?

2104
01:45:21,220 --> 01:45:22,390
He wants to sacrifice you?

2105
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:24,430
No,

2106
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:27,600
that headless monster wants
Ms. Stree's sacrifice, not yours.

2107
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,390
For him, I'm Stree,

2108
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:31,890
because I have her braid.

2109
01:45:34,770 --> 01:45:37,440
Then let's chop that braid off
and give it to him.

2110
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:41,890
Let's deal with this headless
monster first, otherwise.

2111
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:44,020
Like hell, he wants to sacrifice you!
Hey, headless monster!

2112
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,890
No one can do anything.
He's very powerful.

2113
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:49,270
This is the only way to stop him.

2114
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,890
This is why I came here.

2115
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:54,730
And your purpose
is much greater than this.

2116
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,980
You still don't know the powers you have.

2117
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,560
I don't want any powers.

2118
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,010
I WANT YOU!

2119
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:03,350
I'm not going to leave you.
I won't let you sacrifice yourself.

2120
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:04,390
I'm not going anywhere.

2121
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:05,470
Vicky,

2122
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:07,600
you're a protector.

2123
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,100
Don't be so selfish when it comes to love.

2124
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,390
- Go. We don't have much time.
- Yes, I am selfish.

2125
01:46:12,470 --> 01:46:13,600
I'm selfish.

2126
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,720
I'm not going to let you go.

2127
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:17,720
I... I'm going to sit right here.

2128
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:20,060
Let him come, I'll handle him.

2129
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:22,890
I won't let you sacrifice yourself.

2130
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,810
I'm not leaving.

2131
01:46:28,970 --> 01:46:30,390
I'm not going anywhere.

2132
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:31,900
I'm not leaving.

2133
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,890
Vicky, please?

2134
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:36,970
For my sake?

2135
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:40,600
This is cheating.

2136
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:44,110
She is going to sacrifice herself.

2137
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:46,060
- Who?!
- The one who says Vicky please.

2138
01:46:46,140 --> 01:46:47,180
She left my brother.

2139
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:58,770
VICKY!

2140
01:46:58,850 --> 01:47:00,770
No, I'm alright. I'm alright!

2141
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:03,390
I'm alright!

2142
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,690
Be careful.

2143
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:07,770
My vision's all blurry from the tears.

2144
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,390
I'm okay...

2145
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:31,270
Daddy...

2146
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:32,850
Daddy...

2147
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,560
WATCH OUT, VICKY!

2148
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,600
- What happened?!
- He made it. He's safe.

2149
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:38,390
What happened?

2150
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:40,350
He was about to fall into the lava,
but he got through it.

2151
01:47:51,190 --> 01:47:52,310
Let's go.

2152
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:54,770
Let's go, hurry up.

2153
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:09,140
Ms. Shama?

2154
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:11,180
Hey, Ms. Shama?

2155
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,440
Ms. Shama, it's me, Vicky.

2156
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,890
Remember,
I danced with you the other day?

2157
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:20,890
"Behold this beauty
with your eyes tonight, my dove."

2158
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,930
Is Shama alright?

2159
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:25,020
Yeah, she's fine.
She's just a little bald, that's it.

2160
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:25,930
She's not hurt, is she?

2161
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:27,810
Brother Rudra,
you don't want me to see anything else?

2162
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:29,010
Do you really just want me
to keep looking at Shama?

2163
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,140
- No, no, look at everything happening out there.
- Okay.

2164
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,230
Chitti!

2165
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:49,930
Chitti, it's me, Vicky.

2166
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,140
Come on, let's go.

2167
01:48:56,850 --> 01:48:59,980
Soft Chitti, warm Chitti,
little ball of fur.

2168
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,680
Happy Chitti, something Chitti,

2169
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,150
Burr, burr, burr...

2170
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:13,100
Statue over!

2171
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,930
Hey! What's going on?

2172
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,980
Hey, these girls--

2173
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:53,890
You freaky head!

2174
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,680
We did it! We won!

2175
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:34,850
Just wait and watch,
he is going to destroy them.

2176
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:35,720
- Shut it.
- Shut up.

2177
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:37,020
You enemy.

2178
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:40,430
You okay?

2179
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,690
- Okay?
- Yes.

2180
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:42,760
Okay?

2181
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:46,100
You want me to give you mouth-to-mouth?

2182
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:47,850
Why did you come here?

2183
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:50,680
No point sacrificing yourself.

2184
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:53,310
Your Bluetooth's hooked up to those girls.

2185
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:56,350
They would have died too
if you'd done that.

2186
01:50:57,270 --> 01:51:01,150
That's why I chopped
that head off in one go.

2187
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:03,310
You should've seen it!

2188
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:05,140
You missed it.

2189
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:08,520
What?

2190
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:10,730
Huh?!

2191
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,850
I may be wearing a skirt,
but I'm no girl, you creepy head!

2192
01:51:48,850 --> 01:51:51,890
Glory to the Goddess!

2193
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,180
YES!!!

2194
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,730
Oh no, Brother Rudra!

2195
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:19,520
The heads just keep multiplying
when you chop them off.

2196
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,970
Keep that braid swirling.

2197
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:27,180
Keep it swirling.

2198
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,930
Looks like the braid
and dagger don't work on them.

2199
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:32,400
Huh? So what do we do now?

2200
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,730
Look over there.

2201
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:37,110
A sword?

2202
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:38,640
Who left a sword here?

2203
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:39,470
Hey!

2204
01:52:39,560 --> 01:52:41,690
Looks like it's the one Stree used
to behead him.

2205
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:44,230
Then maybe that's what will kill him.

2206
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:45,310
- Yeah?
- Yes.

2207
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:47,060
Go get it.

2208
01:52:47,310 --> 01:52:48,770
Okay, okay, okay.

2209
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,470
Hey freaky head!

2210
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:05,190
If you want to live,

2211
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:06,520
let the girl go.

2212
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,270
Vicky, they're already dead!

2213
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:12,230
Yeah, I mean let the girl go!

2214
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,510
If you think you're man enough,

2215
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:16,350
come fight me.

2216
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,220
Huh?

2217
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,650
Damn it!

2218
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:35,900
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on out or else!

2219
01:53:35,970 --> 01:53:37,550
Shame on you, man!

2220
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:39,310
Time out! Time out! I'm taking it out.

2221
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:41,060
Give me a minute, give me a minute.

2222
01:53:41,140 --> 01:53:42,390
From deep down, Vicky.

2223
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:43,050
What?

2224
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:45,430
Put your whole heart
into trying to pull it out!

2225
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:52,020
"From the bottom of your heart,
I want you to come on out."

2226
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:54,180
Don't sing the song! Put your heart into
it and try to get it out!

2227
01:53:54,270 --> 01:53:55,770
I tried! I just can't get it out!

2228
01:53:58,810 --> 01:53:59,980
Wait a second.

2229
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:06,560
Daddy! Daddy!

2230
01:54:06,640 --> 01:54:10,180
I was just joking when I challenged you!
I was just kidding!

2231
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:20,850
VICKY!

2232
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:38,810
We have to do something or he'll kill them!
Please, Brother Rudra!

2233
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,810
I told you I have a Plan B!

2234
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:02,510
Very good, Bhasky! Very good!

2235
01:56:30,810 --> 01:56:31,640
Are you okay?

2236
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:33,050
- Yeah?
- Yes.

2237
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:35,150
Did... did you see that?

2238
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:37,230
Where the heck did
that shape-shifting dog come from?

2239
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:38,810
He's not a shape-shifting dog,

2240
01:56:38,890 --> 01:56:39,890
he's a wolf.

2241
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:41,430
A wolf?!

2242
01:59:14,930 --> 01:59:18,970
MOTHER!!!!

2243
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:33,850
- What's happening?!
- It's the epic battle, Brother Rudra!

2244
02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:35,560
THE EPIC BATTLE!

2245
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:49,050
We're going to win!
We will win!

2246
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:02,020
Yes!

2247
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,730
No, don't.

2248
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:15,100
If the Stree chapter ends,
so does the world.

2249
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,190
No.
It's not over till it's over, Vicky.

2250
02:01:18,470 --> 02:01:20,430
You're the only one
who can pull that sword out.

2251
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,100
- Just you.
- No.

2252
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,180
No, I can't do it.

2253
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:24,730
You have to recognize your powers.

2254
02:01:24,810 --> 02:01:27,520
Recognize the honesty
and simplicity in your heart.

2255
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:28,890
That's your power.

2256
02:01:28,970 --> 02:01:30,220
Put your heart into trying
to pull it out, Vicky!

2257
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:31,730
Go, give it a shot.

2258
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:33,310
GO!

2259
02:01:52,770 --> 02:01:54,100
Hey!

2260
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:00,470
Ms. Stree!!!

2261
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:05,060
We won!

2262
02:05:05,140 --> 02:05:07,020
We did it! She took him down!
She slayed him!

2263
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:33,650
It's me, Vicky.

2264
02:06:10,520 --> 02:06:12,020
Go, Mother.

2265
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:45,810
Bittu!

2266
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:48,430
Oh, Bittu is fine!
You are back to your usual self, Bittu!

2267
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,230
Thanks to you, Bittu is back!

2268
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:52,230
You know, I jumped

2269
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:53,600
- and chopped his head off in one go.
- Yes, we saw that.

2270
02:06:53,680 --> 02:06:55,850
- And then, Ms. Stree grabbed him by his head
- Yes.

2271
02:06:55,930 --> 02:06:57,890
and tossed him into the lava,
just like that.

2272
02:06:58,930 --> 02:07:01,310
We were all there watching it happen.

2273
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:03,470
Tell me something,
when will Shama be back from there?

2274
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:05,440
And what about Chitti? Where's Chitti?

2275
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:06,900
Aw, my dear lover boys...

2276
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:09,550
Look, there they come -
Shama, Chitti, and all the other women.

2277
02:07:31,180 --> 02:07:33,890
"Through your deeds,
righteousness is shown,"

2278
02:07:33,970 --> 02:07:36,850
"With discipline, courage is known,"

2279
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:40,470
"In success or failure, stay the same,
with a balanced heart and steady aim."

2280
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,230
Yes,

2281
02:08:07,810 --> 02:08:09,310
I'm Stree's daughter.

2282
02:08:10,350 --> 02:08:12,180
But she wanted to kill you.

2283
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:14,430
She doesn't recognize me
in this form.

2284
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:18,390
In her eyes,
her daughter is still the little girl

2285
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:21,350
who was crying as she was killed.

2286
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:24,310
When she was killed?

2287
02:08:25,350 --> 02:08:27,180
But that was like forever ago.

2288
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:28,650
It's part of our scriptures.

2289
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:29,970
Vicky...

2290
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:33,270
Vicky, all I ever wanted was to help

2291
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:35,640
my mother's soul find salvation.

2292
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:37,430
And you were the only one
who could make that happen.

2293
02:08:37,770 --> 02:08:40,980
That's why I reached out to you
and befriended you.

2294
02:08:43,390 --> 02:08:46,350
From helping Stree find salvation
to slaying that headless monster -

2295
02:08:46,890 --> 02:08:48,470
it all happened because of you.

2296
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,310
Because of me?

2297
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:53,890
I don't get it.

2298
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:56,140
You...

2299
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:59,560
Why didn't you tell me
about all this earlier?

2300
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:02,980
How could I have, Vicky?

2301
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,180
How could I tell you that I...?

2302
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:06,970
That you...?

2303
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:10,940
That I am what everyone thinks I am.

2304
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:12,350
What do you mean?

2305
02:09:13,390 --> 02:09:14,430
An illusion,

2306
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,430
a shadow.

2307
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:19,260
You...

2308
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:21,350
You are a ghost?

2309
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:25,810
But aren't you way too pretty
to be a ghost?

2310
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:29,390
And your feet too...

2311
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:36,350
So everything we had was all just a lie?

2312
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:40,890
No, it wasn't a lie.

2313
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:44,350
It's a relationship,
that will always remain.

2314
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:48,270
It's a bond
that one soul shares with another.

2315
02:09:50,060 --> 02:09:51,190
Soul...

2316
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:56,680
Please, don't leave.

2317
02:09:57,180 --> 02:09:59,100
I'll adjust to the fact
that you're a ghost.

2318
02:09:59,180 --> 02:10:00,560
Dad will understand too.

2319
02:10:00,770 --> 02:10:01,690
He...

2320
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:04,350
Please, don't go.

2321
02:10:05,890 --> 02:10:07,220
I have to go.

2322
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,680
I don't even know your name.

2323
02:10:17,180 --> 02:10:18,220
Huh?

2324
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:20,980
Seriously?

2325
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:23,220
Yes.

2326
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,770
Oh, it's nice.

2327
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:26,600
We'll cross paths again, Vicky.

2328
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:29,100
Remember,

2329
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:31,310
we are already one.

2330
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:37,720
I am wherever you are.

2331
02:10:45,390 --> 02:10:46,810
Take care.

2332
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:51,270
And make sure to eat on time...
whatever it is you guys eat.

2333
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:04,560
Huh?

2334
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,220
Oh shit!

2335
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:08,560
She's gone!

2336
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,890
Hey...

2337
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,520
Vicky...

2338
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:40,810
Sorry, we're late.

2339
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:42,100
Sorry, Brother. Really sorry.

2340
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:43,100
Where is she?

2341
02:11:43,180 --> 02:11:45,850
- She's gone.
- Huh?

2342
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:48,220
Oh no, I didn't even get to say goodbye.

2343
02:11:48,310 --> 02:11:49,480
Gone again?

2344
02:11:49,890 --> 02:11:51,520
Did you at least ask
for her name this time?

2345
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:53,230
Yes.

2346
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:54,810
So what did she say it was?

2347
02:11:58,310 --> 02:12:00,770
- What?
- He's trying to remember.

2348
02:12:01,430 --> 02:12:03,310
Tell us, Vicky. Come on, spill it.

2349
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:07,930
What happened, Vicky?

2350
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:10,100
He knows but he's not telling us.

2351
02:12:24,270 --> 02:12:25,850
Bhasky!

2352
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:28,600
Janardhan!

2353
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:29,310
Where are you?

2354
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:30,220
JD!

2355
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:31,390
JD!

2356
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:33,680
- Where were you?
- Where were you hiding?

2357
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:35,020
Here, try these on.

2358
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:36,310
Ugh, gross.

2359
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:39,680
Whose raggedy clothes did you steal?

2360
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:40,690
These are mine.

2361
02:12:40,770 --> 02:12:41,900
You'll look good in them.

2362
02:12:41,970 --> 02:12:44,300
You wear Munni's underwear?!
You pervert!

2363
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:47,890
And what the heck was that, man?

2364
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:49,480
How did that creature
even end up in Chanderi?

2365
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,020
It's a long story,

2366
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:52,730
I'll tell you later.
Let's go home now.

2367
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:54,270
I'll pack and then
we'll hit the road to Delhi.

2368
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:56,270
- Brother, you rock my clothes.
- You can't go to Delhi.

2369
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:57,390
Why not?

2370
02:12:58,520 --> 02:12:59,770
It's dangerous out there.

2371
02:12:59,850 --> 02:13:00,810
Why, because of the pollution?

2372
02:13:00,890 --> 02:13:02,600
Something much worse.

2373
02:13:03,180 --> 02:13:08,680
He sinks his fangs into this vein
and sucks the blood out.

2374
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:10,770
Look JD, I'm a wolf,

2375
02:13:10,850 --> 02:13:12,350
I can handle myself in any situation.

2376
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:14,060
But if he gets you...

2377
02:13:14,140 --> 02:13:16,270
He'll slurp up my blood like a soda.

2378
02:13:16,350 --> 02:13:17,230
Hundred percent.

2379
02:13:17,310 --> 02:13:18,690
You are right.

2380
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:21,150
You should go to Delhi
and give me a buzz if you need anything.

2381
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:22,430
I need you.
I really need you for something.

2382
02:13:22,520 --> 02:13:24,230
I'm always there for you, bro. Always.

2383
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:28,770
You know that chick with the big eyes
and the long braid?

2384
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:31,140
Set me up with her.

2385
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:33,720
Hey, my friend already has
a thing with her.

2386
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:35,350
The one in the frock?

2387
02:13:35,430 --> 02:13:37,220
I bet she would ditch him for me.

2388
02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:39,480
Bhasky, you're a wolf,

2389
02:13:39,680 --> 02:13:40,930
but don't act like a creepy animal.

2390
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:42,520
Okay, what about just an intro?

2391
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,680
She is powerful, and so am I.

2392
02:13:44,890 --> 02:13:47,470
Together, we'd be a power couple.

2393
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,600
Blegh! Let me go, you rascal.
You've changed, Bhasky.

2394
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:51,390
At least tell me where she lives,
what she's into,

2395
02:13:51,470 --> 02:13:53,010
- what she eats, and what she's looking for.
- Disgusting.

2396
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:53,980
Let me at least make a move.

2397
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:55,600
Your buddy won't be able to handle her.

2398
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:56,430
Come on man, you're a wolf!

2399
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:57,650
- Stop behaving like a dirty rabbit!
- Trust me, he won't be able to handle her.

2400
02:13:57,720 --> 02:14:00,430
- I want her! I really want her!
- She is not going to come back.

2401
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:01,940
She was unfaithful.

2402
02:14:02,020 --> 02:14:03,980
She was an illusion.

2403
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:08,720
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

2404
02:14:12,020 --> 02:14:16,060
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

2405
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:20,020
"You made a promise but it was a lie,"

2406
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:23,890
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2407
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:27,560
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2408
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:31,680
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2409
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:43,350
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

2410
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:47,260
"With no blanket to warm me
in the middle of the night,"

2411
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:50,980
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

2412
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:54,850
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

2413
02:14:54,970 --> 02:14:58,970
"I waited all night in the fields
but you never came by."

2414
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:11,430
"All dressed up
I was ready to leave that day,"

2415
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:15,190
"But my mother glared and made me stay."

2416
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:23,150
"She questioned,
"Where are you going, you little brat?"

2417
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:26,300
"Maidens don't roam fields
and that's a fact!"

2418
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:30,770
"She said boys who ask girls to meet
in the fields,"

2419
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:38,060
"She said boys who ask girls to meet
in the fields,"

2420
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:41,970
"They never marry those girls
and their love never seals."

2421
02:15:49,810 --> 02:15:53,440
"I spent the night in the fields waiting,
but you never came by,"

2422
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:57,390
"I spent the night in the fields waiting,
but you never came by,"

2423
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:02,020
"My youth is fading fast while
waiting here for you,"

2424
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:05,940
No, my dear, in love.
Yes.

2425
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:13,060
"My youth is fading fast while
waiting here for you,"

2426
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:16,930
"I never wooed another girl
for I thought I had you."

2427
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:20,810
"I never wooed another girl
for I thought I had you."

2428
02:16:20,890 --> 02:16:24,680
"I never wooed another girl
for I thought I had you."

2429
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:28,220
You've said it three times already,
now move on.

2430
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:32,060
"I spent the night in the fields waiting
but you never came by."

2431
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:35,890
"I spent the night in the fields waiting
but you never came by."

2432
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:39,800
"You said you'd be there
but you never came by."

2433
02:16:39,890 --> 02:16:43,770
"I spent the night in the fields waiting
but you never came by."
