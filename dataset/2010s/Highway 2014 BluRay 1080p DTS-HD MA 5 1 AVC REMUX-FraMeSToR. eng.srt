1
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,946
What was so urgent?

2
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,200
We have the rest of our
lives. We can meet anytime

3
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,118
Let's go

4
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,413
Veera, I think you should
go back. No one saw us

5
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,416
Vinay, I want to breathe.
Wedding traditions

6
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,836
Welcome! The costumes,
the jewelry, etc...

7
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,714
Please let's get away for awhile

8
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,465
Just for an hour

9
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,466
An hour?

10
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:05,676
Start the car

11
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,927
- 15 minutes
- Let's go

12
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,137
15 minutes!

13
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:31,994
5 minutes to go

14
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,996
Time hasn't started

15
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,291
Let's escape these bright
lights. Out in the open

16
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,919
- To the highway?
- Without bodyguards?

17
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,796
Just a glimpse of the highway. Ok?

18
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,402
All the knots in
my brain are untying

19
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,196
Good. Let's head back

20
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,739
Some untying left

21
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,409
A little longer has
become a lot longer

22
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,577
SQ?

23
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,580
Veera, it isn't safe here

24
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,874
You're here

25
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:31,637
Vinay...

26
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:34,807
Let's not go back. Let's run away

27
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,227
Yes! Let's make a run for it

28
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,855
And make a beautiful
home on some mountain top

29
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,067
You can be a shepherd. I can cook

30
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,152
It'll be great fun

31
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,404
I'm turning back

32
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,781
Enough!

33
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,076
Should've turned back

34
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,016
ls it closed?

35
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,648
See!

36
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,944
The air is so
different here. So fresh

37
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,698
Breathing the city
air makes you restless

38
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,199
Why can't it be like this?

39
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,161
If you've had your fun, come back

40
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,787
Come out!

41
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:39,913
Veera, hurry

42
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,376
He's coming from behind

43
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,961
Hey, you scum

44
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,258
Run!

45
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,138
You there, stop!

46
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,142
Stay there, all of you

47
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,394
Swine!

48
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,565
She gets it next

49
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,151
I won't say it again

50
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,447
- What's wrong with the jeep?
- Wasn't it checked?

51
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:22,998
Take this car

52
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,168
I warned you

53
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,472
I'm watching you

54
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,229
Follow me and I'll shoot you

55
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,275
Call Tonk

56
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,452
Tonk, got a car? Where are you?

57
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,539
- Where to?
- Know Mangar back road?

58
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,833
Drive on. I'll tell you

59
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,045
The road behind the
hills. In the fields

60
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,902
Let her go

61
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,191
Open the back door

62
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,517
Tie her hands

63
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:44,616
O beloved, I will carry you
far away from this market place

64
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,039
Far away from all your sorrows

65
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:08,450
Your name?

66
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,286
What's your name?

67
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,038
I want to go home

68
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,875
Name?

69
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,380
Stop!

70
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,007
Speak up!

71
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:26,843
Veera

72
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:27,969
Veera, what?

73
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:29,971
Tripathi

74
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,269
Manek Tripathi's daughter?

75
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,134
I told you a thousand times.
Stay away from the rich

76
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,760
No messing with them

77
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,221
They're linked to big shots

78
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,975
They'll skin you alive
if you mess with them

79
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,977
Now deal with it

80
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,647
He didn't know who she was

81
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,316
Who travels in a
flashy Audi? Tell me

82
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,610
Tripathi's daughter

83
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,570
Yes

84
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,655
Tripathi's daughter

85
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,453
The police, the Home
Guard. BSF, the army

86
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,290
They're crawl up your
backside and exit your mouth

87
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,084
Now save your ass

88
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,506
A man should know his place

89
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,136
Why climb a mountain if
you don't have the balls?

90
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,267
What are you staring at?

91
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,562
What will you do? Eat me?

92
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,693
You're scared shitless.
Pair of eunuchs!

93
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,196
Bhaati!

94
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,783
You shouldn't have said that

95
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,245
I won't forget this

96
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:19,998
No, I won't, Bhaati

97
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,336
Or should I fix you right now?

98
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,632
Put that away

99
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,677
- Easy
- Bullshit

100
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,601
Stay away from the rich

101
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,186
Fear them!

102
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,354
Not a word more

103
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,147
Why should we fear the rich?

104
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,274
Salute them

105
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,860
Open doors for them? Why?

106
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,405
Because they can take
your ass whenever they want

107
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,325
They've got it all. What's left?

108
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,413
We're used to licking ass.
Enjoy getting screwed now

109
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,541
You mother

110
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:03,708
Let's go

111
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,793
Sit!

112
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,631
You're talking about Manek Tripathi

113
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,300
He owns industries around the world

114
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,929
Ministers and politicians are
his mates. Must we take them on?

115
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,430
What will you do?

116
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:18,974
What now?

117
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,767
Call him

118
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,936
Hello, Tripathi-ji

119
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,606
You know what? Your
daughter is in our custody

120
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,733
I am texting you an address

121
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,986
Get there with the ransom, please

122
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:31,987
Yes

123
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,322
That's just what I'll say

124
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,367
And when the girl
gets shot in the leg...

125
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,370
...Tripathi will come
panting with the cash

126
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:45,166
Or I'll sell her off to a
brothel. In some shady street

127
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,044
Vanished. India is too big

128
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,005
A bad omen is shadowing him

129
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,382
He'll land us in trouble too

130
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,634
You'll die a dog's death, Bhaati

131
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,013
A dog always dies a dog's death

132
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,849
What'll they do to me?

133
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,226
Hang me four times?

134
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,396
I've murdered three men already

135
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,275
I'll die as I lived

136
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,111
But this will happen

137
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,571
This I will do

138
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,913
Listen

139
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,166
Wake up!

140
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,839
Gaurav

141
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,218
Don't be scared

142
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,847
They call me Goru

143
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,726
I'll take care of you

144
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,814
No

145
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,193
I'll talk to you later

146
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,072
We have to go now. Too risky here

147
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,908
Get up. Now!

148
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,643
I don't trust any of you anyway

149
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,813
So do what you have to do

150
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,149
Let's go

151
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,238
Switch off your phones

152
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,991
Their woman is in our hands

153
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,743
Today is our day

154
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,289
Hail Baba Kisan Das!

155
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,711
Hail Lakkad Maharaj!

156
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,341
Hail to our villages. Our land!

157
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,927
Long live!

158
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,520
Any new qawali out in the market?

159
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,731
Listen, brother

160
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,150
People don't like
listening to new qawalis

161
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,068
A special recitation

162
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,945
In honor of Khwaja Gharib Nawaz

163
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,364
- Is it old?
- Very old

164
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,617
Then it's fine

165
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,644
You've outdone yourself

166
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,355
Your name will spread far

167
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,440
Couldn't talk on the phone

168
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,070
- I heard today. Tried calling you
- Where will you hide us?

169
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,865
Things have changed

170
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,659
You're famous now

171
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,579
Wherever you go with the girl,
all Ajmer Sharif will know

172
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,749
And we'll all become
famous. You can't stay here

173
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,584
ls it on the news?

174
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,461
Not yet

175
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,006
Everyone knows because
of the damn police

176
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,095
My God

177
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,723
You have M.K. Tripathi's
daughter. Imagine!

178
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,282
It's me

179
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,958
You unwell?

180
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,221
Your lips must be numb

181
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,107
I'm on your side

182
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:10,236
Make sure you never
talk to anyone about me

183
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,614
They're dangerous people

184
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,659
Who knows what they'll do to you?

185
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,538
You couldn't even imagine it

186
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,126
I am here

187
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,380
I'll take care of you

188
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,883
I'll take care of you

189
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,851
You want to return home, don't you?

190
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,937
You want to go home?

191
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,482
Back to your parents?

192
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,234
To your family?

193
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,070
You want to go home?

194
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,822
I'll take you back

195
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,128
You're back?

196
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,255
I gave her some water

197
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,050
We'll feed her later

198
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,135
There's Aadoo

199
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,929
- We're over there
- Sit down

200
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,100
Hey, Aadoo

201
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,310
Hurry UP!

202
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,460
Check the corner

203
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,381
All clear

204
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,459
What is it?

205
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,044
- She wants to run
- So?

206
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,219
Run!

207
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,014
Well?

208
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,267
Run

209
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:14,076
Where are You? Where am I?

210
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:37,850
O Lord, show compassion on me

211
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:43,105
Countless sorrows surround me

212
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:50,112
I believe that You
will restore my world

213
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:55,034
Heed the one who has no one

214
00:33:55,993 --> 00:34:02,041
Where are You? Where am I?

215
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:25,814
How fearsome is the path before me

216
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:31,195
Why have You turned away from me?

217
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,877
Where am I?

218
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,797
Where am I?

219
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:53,175
Darkness descends around me

220
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:56,053
No light to be seen

221
00:34:56,345 --> 00:35:00,391
Body broken, soul defeated

222
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,145
The stars of good fortune have faded

223
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:08,065
Show a ray of hope

224
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,236
There's nothingness everywhere

225
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,087
Get back!

226
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,425
She ran away on her own accord.
She'll return in the same way

227
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,760
Move!

228
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,290
No tea for me?

229
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,754
I'm making paneer. Will you eat it?

230
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,380
We need SIM cards

231
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,716
Take Tonk with you

232
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,509
Send the stuff back with him

233
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,845
- We need other stuff too
- Don't worry

234
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,434
Can you hear me?

235
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:28,979
What is it?

236
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:33,067
Can I come out just
for a little while?

237
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,278
Why?

238
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:40,908
Closed spaces...

239
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:43,702
...make my head spin

240
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,581
I'm feeling ill

241
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:53,712
- Let her out
- I won't try and run

242
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,423
Just for awhile

243
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,439
This is such an odd place

244
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,235
Never seen a place like this

245
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,907
We spend all our time
in hotels on our holidays

246
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:25,536
No point traveling

247
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,207
May as well just check
into a Delhi hotel

248
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:33,335
Hotels are the same everywhere

249
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,380
Why am I talking so much?

250
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,718
It feels so unreal

251
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,971
Like I'm watching a movie

252
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:48,308
I've no control. Words
pour out without my knowing

253
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:54,565
Actually, I haven't said
a word for almost two days

254
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:12,416
Feels good sitting
out here. So thank you

255
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,423
I felt like throwing up inside

256
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,301
That's why I said...

257
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:27,222
Feels better out here.
It's the fresh air

258
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,935
I'm still talking!

259
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,735
I should be tense right now

260
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,321
I am tense

261
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,201
No more talking

262
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,579
- Is the tea ok?
- It's different

263
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,791
It's good. Sugar in
it? Or something else?

264
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,418
Hey! You made the tea

265
00:38:56,877 --> 00:39:00,339
I added sugar, but
maybe some salt fell in

266
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,633
There's salt everywhere

267
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,718
On my face, too

268
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:07,137
I thought it was only me

269
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,389
Everyone's got salt on them

270
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,810
Look at my arm Salt here too

271
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,199
Why did you have to
run away like that?

272
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,160
I told you I'd make some arrangement

273
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,663
Now listen carefully

274
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,083
Has the salt gone?

275
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:38,919
No

276
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:45,509
You better trust me. How
will it work otherwise?

277
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,719
Here's my plan

278
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,721
Panicking won't help

279
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:12,077
I know what you must be
thinking, brother Mahabir

280
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,918
Maybe you misunderstand
the whole thing

281
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,920
That's possible, no?

282
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,590
I'll tell you what's going on

283
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,553
You've it got wrong. Listen

284
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:33,599
She's a consignment. Not a girl

285
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,350
lam not arguing...

286
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,229
End of story

287
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:52,451
And you! Can't you dress decently?

288
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,584
See you

289
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,488
Let's go

290
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,750
We're going now?

291
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:43,877
- Where to?
- No idea

292
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,090
Will Goru tell everyone?

293
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:49,591
Shut her mouth!

294
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,468
Tie her hands. In the truck!

295
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,986
What about the truck papers?
And the state border police?

296
00:42:09,236 --> 00:42:11,321
We need the license
plate registration

297
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,409
Show these papers. They belong
to a junked old truck. Here

298
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:17,202
Well done, brother!

299
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,079
Now what's the plan?

300
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:22,666
- We talk to Tonk in Ajmer
- Shall I switch the phone on?

301
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,793
Throw that SIM card away

302
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:26,837
We'll call from a landline

303
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,933
Stop!

304
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,936
Look away!

305
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,450
Where the hell were you?

306
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:22,744
Where were you?

307
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:25,664
Have you lost your mind?

308
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,624
How dare you ask?

309
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:32,629
You can go and relieve yourself,
don't I have to go, too?

310
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,048
Think about it

311
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:40,929
Come

312
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,657
- What happened?
- Got through?

313
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,493
Tonk will call her
parents from her phone

314
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,662
He'll meet us in two days

315
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:10,667
I'll sit in front

316
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,129
I'll break your bones
if you talk nonsense

317
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:15,964
Ok

318
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:19,926
Break my bones. Satisfy yourself

319
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:21,970
But I will sit in front

320
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,389
No problem

321
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:25,891
I'll sit next to her

322
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:29,144
She'll be sandwiched between us. OK?

323
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,492
I was very rude

324
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,541
I'm never so rude to anyone

325
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,630
I'm usually so well behaved

326
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:59,341
I have good manners

327
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,509
And with you...

328
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:10,435
- I felt like throwing up
- Shut up!

329
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,647
Am I saying sorry?

330
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,733
Are we here to show
off our good manners?

331
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,111
Show them off in your father's house

332
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,495
Hurry UP!

333
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:46,364
Hi, Veera

334
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,036
How are you?

335
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,333
How am I?

336
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,549
I'll think about it and let you know

337
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:37,665
Let me tell you an old tale

338
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:49,844
Bless my words as I tell it

339
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:26,756
My love for Heer dethroned me

340
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:32,762
Destiny turned me into a fakir

341
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,905
Destiny turned me into a fakir

342
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:10,216
The Lord can destroy
kings and princes

343
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:22,770
And create wise men and saints

344
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:16,449
Up!

345
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,039
What happened, sir?

346
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,457
What's inside?

347
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,833
Nothing, sir

348
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:26,876
Nothing?

349
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:28,586
Driving an empty truck?

350
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,880
Just some household goods

351
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,675
Or stolen goods from Rajasthan?

352
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:36,678
I swear on my mother, sir

353
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,346
Get out!

354
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:42,642
Open the back

355
00:51:43,977 --> 00:51:46,813
- May I talk, sir?
- What is it?

356
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:50,108
- We're in a hurry
- So?

357
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,735
Can we work this out?

358
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:56,155
Bribing the police?
You little scumbag

359
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:58,116
Do you have the means?

360
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,118
Open up! Move

361
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,331
Open it!

362
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,459
Open up. Right now!

363
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:10,461
Want a caning?

364
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:20,972
Quick!

365
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:24,767
The other one

366
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:33,443
Step aside!

367
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:56,007
You have a dishonest face

368
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,510
So you confused us. Get going!

369
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,683
You offended?

370
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,435
Should I confiscate it?

371
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:09,312
No, sir

372
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:17,737
Let them go

373
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,599
What happened?

374
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,230
Were you hiding?

375
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:59,696
Did you hide?

376
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,240
Yeah

377
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:04,242
Why?

378
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:08,037
This was your chance

379
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,123
Why did you hide?

380
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,333
Don't know

381
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:14,627
Don't know means?

382
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:16,963
Don't know means don't know

383
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,092
Maybe I've lost my mind

384
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,263
I could've escaped so easily

385
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:31,853
What's wrong with me?

386
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,783
Eat quickly if you want to eat

387
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:48,745
We're not stopping for long

388
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,342
I was nine years old

389
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,597
At home...

390
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:14,395
He used to bring
imported chocolates for me

391
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,983
My uncle

392
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,406
He made me sit on his lap

393
00:55:27,116 --> 00:55:28,659
And loved me

394
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:37,293
And then alone...

395
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:41,506
In the bathroom

396
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:47,595
He would make me
sit on his lap again

397
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,851
And love me

398
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,691
I used to scream

399
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:04,529
But he'd cover my mouth

400
00:56:04,737 --> 00:56:05,571
Like this

401
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,324
Cover my mouth

402
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,079
So my screams could not come out

403
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,624
It hurt so much

404
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,631
"It's all over...

405
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,050
"We're done...

406
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,595
"My doll...

407
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:34,183
"You are the best girl
in the whole world...

408
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,188
"The most beautiful"

409
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,361
He came home again

410
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,657
Again and again he came

411
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,120
Inside I was screaming my lungs out

412
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,545
"Don't tell anyone. Ok?"

413
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:06,966
One day I told Mummy

414
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:10,219
Explained to her

415
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,393
Mummy said...

416
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,276
"Don't tell anyone

417
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,153
"Ok?"

418
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,204
I didn't tell anyone

419
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,963
Then one day it all stopped

420
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,927
But he still visited

421
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,974
With chocolates for me

422
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,145
He comes to the house even now

423
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,359
I sit on his lap

424
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,363
He loves me

425
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,158
I laugh

426
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,871
"My doll...

427
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:24,377
"The most beautiful of all"

428
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,979
The beasts

429
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,192
Manners. Culture

430
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,152
Greet them

431
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:52,363
Touch their feet in respect

432
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:01,622
They're all around you

433
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,293
You have to survive among them

434
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,838
Laugh with them

435
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:12,008
Befriend them

436
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,303
Love them

437
01:01:03,202 --> 01:01:05,996
The place you've got me from...

438
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,417
I don't want to go back there

439
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,134
The place we're going,
don't want to get there

440
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,891
But this road...

441
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,149
It's very good

442
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:40,156
I want this road never to end

443
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:09,643
The case was filed at
Dera Mandi police station

444
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:11,729
All the details are here

445
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,109
This cannot go public

446
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:20,070
The special cell
is handling the case

447
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:24,158
Information will be
shared with caution

448
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:27,912
His name is Mahabir
Bhaati. He's on the run

449
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:31,790
They're not professional
kidnappers, just petty criminals

450
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:34,251
Land grabbing, armed robbery, etc

451
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:38,714
Call from the girl's phone.
Then remove the battery

452
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:41,842
A call from Veera's phone

453
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,056
First let's find out if
it's worth trusting you

454
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:49,475
I'll call later

455
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,311
The call's from Noida. Near Delhi

456
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,996
I came of my own accord to tell you

457
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,623
Why would I lie now?

458
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:16,085
I've no clue where
the swine has taken her

459
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:26,095
I've come from so far
to tell you everything

460
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,307
Hiding is out of question

461
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:32,518
Just ask!

462
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,147
They left this place a week ago

463
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,774
They could be anywhere

464
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:41,860
I'll tell you when to
hand over the ransom money

465
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:45,406
Just relax. And wait

466
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,783
He called from Calcutta

467
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,115
God knows where she is

468
01:04:29,825 --> 01:04:31,744
What they're doing to her

469
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,590
A bite of sweet paan

470
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,258
A cotton Lahori suit

471
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:49,178
In high spirits, the firefly soars

472
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,896
The Lord is your
gardener, 0 green forest

473
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,775
Never mind the cuss words,
He watches your every step

474
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:06,362
Ignore what the world thinks

475
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:10,407
Take the name of God.
Take the name of Ali

476
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:29,343
She has taken the path to Him

477
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,829
Firefly, free spirit, firecracker

478
01:05:57,204 --> 01:06:00,290
Flying about intoxicated

479
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:48,338
Throwing caution to the
wind, I am in Your hands

480
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,651
God's chosen one

481
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:18,076
God will take away the
suffering He inflicts

482
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:28,670
Take His name and dance

483
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:47,564
Growing wild like the peepal tree

484
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:51,276
No one plants her.
No one can cage her

485
01:07:51,485 --> 01:07:55,072
On this endless journey,
like rainwater falling

486
01:07:55,364 --> 01:07:58,867
Soiled if she touches the ground

487
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:02,412
Ali is Your name

488
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:27,437
Throwing caution to the
wind, I am in Your hands

489
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,480
Wow!

490
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:19,489
Unique places in this country

491
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,158
Tell me

492
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:25,871
Why are the rich fascinated
by dirty run-down old ruins?

493
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,126
Step to the side

494
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:33,837
Hold this

495
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,799
Hold it straight. We
need to see the date

496
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:39,760
- What language is it?
- Bengali

497
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:43,680
So they think we're
in Bengal. Smart!

498
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,768
You've been abducted. Look upset

499
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:50,270
Who'd pay ransom for you?

500
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:51,772
Stop laughing

501
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,815
Be serious

502
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,818
How can I be serious,
looking at you, Aadoo?

503
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:01,865
I'll turn around

504
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:06,995
Higher

505
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,625
This place is good

506
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:13,627
The market is nearby

507
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,173
Better buy her clothes

508
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:20,509
She'll stand out like this

509
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,971
Everything will be ok

510
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:26,723
But I'd like to know...

511
01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:30,018
If anything goes wrong,
the ransom, the calls

512
01:10:30,686 --> 01:10:32,562
By the way, are we still...

513
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:37,442
Sticking to our plan?

514
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:39,945
Why?

515
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:41,905
Just asking

516
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,491
We're selling the girl to a brothel

517
01:10:47,536 --> 01:10:49,162
Don't get fond of her

518
01:10:49,496 --> 01:10:50,914
Nothing like that

519
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,250
ls she the only respectable one?

520
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,337
What about the poor?

521
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,716
Women are taken away at night

522
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:03,719
For some big shot

523
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:06,513
A woman is required tonight

524
01:11:07,097 --> 01:11:08,306
And who takes her to him?

525
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,600
Her own husband

526
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,185
Her man

527
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:19,401
He sits outside while his wife
is inside with the big shot

528
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,695
Then the door opens

529
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:25,407
He brings his wife back home

530
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:31,329
And takes out all his
frustrations on the woman

531
01:11:33,248 --> 01:11:37,711
Because the rich can have
us when they feel like

532
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:41,006
To hell with them

533
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,009
To hell with them

534
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:03,278
Drop it

535
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,405
He's not in the mood

536
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:07,157
I'll fix his mood

537
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:23,590
Are you mad?

538
01:12:24,716 --> 01:12:25,675
Never do that

539
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:28,178
Got it

540
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:32,933
What is it?

541
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,607
You bought me clothes

542
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,068
Aadoo told me

543
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:47,197
Stop acting. I look very nice

544
01:12:57,374 --> 01:12:58,750
What is this song?

545
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,503
What is it?

546
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:03,630
I want to hear the song

547
01:13:04,339 --> 01:13:05,465
That's it

548
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:08,510
Go now

549
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,888
Mahabir Bhaati

550
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:32,075
- Where did you hear it?
- What's it to you?

551
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,287
Now I have to know

552
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:37,706
What song was that?

553
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,587
It's not a song

554
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,630
Then?

555
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,174
So where did you hear it?

556
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,469
My mother sang it

557
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:58,268
She sang for you?

558
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,105
Tell me

559
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,565
Yes, she sang it for me

560
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:09,821
When she went to
work, I went with her

561
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:14,326
I'd cry so she'd sing. Ok?

562
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:17,203
You would cry?

563
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,880
Does your mother live with you?

564
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,884
Enough. Go inside!

565
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:32,135
Stand up!

566
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:36,640
You see, I don't feel like going

567
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:38,767
Too smart!

568
01:14:38,767 --> 01:14:39,726
Right!

569
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,479
I'm not scared anymore

570
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,523
Don't get offended, but...

571
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:48,443
I find you really cute now

572
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:53,573
So what made you cry?

573
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:56,409
Who troubled the little one?

574
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,120
I won't ask again

575
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,307
Sleep now

576
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:27,315
Do not cry

577
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:37,742
Look down!

578
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:45,250
Where's your mind?
You burnt the food

579
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:22,328
My adored son, sleep now

580
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:27,709
Your dreams will carry you
to a field of sweet delights

581
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:37,469
The parrot on the
tree tells you to smile

582
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:54,944
The swan wants to befriend you

583
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:00,742
My adored son

584
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:34,400
The night is dark as coal

585
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:41,407
Your eyes fill with sleep

586
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,496
With a blanket of stars covering you

587
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:49,749
Sleep a sweet sleep

588
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:28,329
If you toss and turn

589
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:33,918
The mynah bird will steal you away

590
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:52,270
A star, a little star

591
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,940
A falling star

592
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:59,360
Asks after you

593
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:06,409
Why don't you sleep? Why do you cry?

594
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:12,373
Why did you get so lost?

595
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,715
What upset you? Who upset you?

596
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:26,429
What did you leave behind
in the land you came from?

597
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:46,491
Your mother...

598
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:48,952
What do you call her?

599
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:01,422
Amma

600
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:03,675
So...

601
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:08,930
ls she well?

602
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:16,646
I mean

603
01:20:17,522 --> 01:20:18,773
ls she all right?

604
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:30,243
You have to promise me, Mahabir

605
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,788
Once we're done with all this

606
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:36,124
You'll see her

607
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:39,711
Where is she?

608
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:46,342
In the village

609
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:50,763
So you'll go to the
village and see her

610
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:17,623
Tell me what is in your heart

611
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:23,838
Share your thoughts with me

612
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:07,632
Sleep now, my adored son

613
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:27,819
- It's full English, right?
- Total English, sir

614
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,697
This one

615
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,216
Come

616
01:24:58,636 --> 01:24:59,845
Take your stuff

617
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:12,066
Chandigarh bus station?

618
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,110
I'm proud of you

619
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:19,532
You leaving?

620
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:25,746
Take care of yourself

621
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,540
We'll meet again

622
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:24,096
Look there

623
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,516
A police station. Go inside
and talk to the man in charge

624
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:32,605
Tell him your name and your father's
name. Say you're the kidnapped girl

625
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,523
You know I won't go

626
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,942
Take your phone.
Call your home first

627
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:38,944
Can't you hear me? I won't go

628
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,989
You won't go? So what
will you do with me?

629
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:44,784
Marry me?

630
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:47,078
Raise my kids?

631
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:48,412
What will you do?

632
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,623
What's come over you?

633
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,917
Why make a scene?

634
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:55,127
What will you do with me?

635
01:26:55,795 --> 01:26:56,462
Well?

636
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:58,714
You know who I am

637
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,549
That's just it

638
01:27:01,092 --> 01:27:02,551
I know who you really are

639
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:04,887
I killed three people

640
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:06,347
I have

641
01:27:07,848 --> 01:27:10,226
With these very hands

642
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:18,234
My life is over.
It'll never get fixed

643
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:19,527
Never

644
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:23,364
I will only die. You should go back

645
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:24,949
I Pray for you

646
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:30,996
How did it all happen?

647
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:33,624
I'm telling you to go

648
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:35,668
It'll be a disaster. Go away!

649
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:37,920
What's your story?

650
01:27:38,379 --> 01:27:40,381
- How did this happen?
- Shut up!

651
01:27:41,215 --> 01:27:42,591
Go to the police station

652
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,219
I won't go. What will you do?

653
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:48,597
Let go!

654
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:53,102
Are you that strong? I won't go

655
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:54,645
Don't drive me crazy

656
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:56,522
Kill me too

657
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:01,444
Stop, Mahabir

658
01:28:01,861 --> 01:28:02,862
Don't be childish

659
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,369
What's wrong?

660
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,477
One minute. I have to make a call

661
01:29:12,723 --> 01:29:14,725
Where do I catch the
bus to Chandigarh?

662
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,105
- Reckong Peo bus stand?
- Get in

663
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,544
Get this straight

664
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:28,132
Whatever happens, you
don't decide alone. Got it?

665
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:31,093
Move away. Stand there

666
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:08,756
I was bound to come this way

667
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:17,681
My path is somewhere here

668
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,852
I stand at the crossroad

669
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:30,069
The journey opens its arms to me

670
01:31:34,448 --> 01:31:36,575
Where am I?

671
01:31:55,302 --> 01:31:58,180
Fearsome paths, open roads

672
01:32:01,642 --> 01:32:04,770
Shaky plans, strong bonds

673
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:17,032
Where am I?

674
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,987
A 20-minute stop. Be quick!

675
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:20,512
There's no plan about raising kids

676
01:33:26,602 --> 01:33:28,145
Or marrying

677
01:33:30,773 --> 01:33:31,982
There's no plan

678
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:37,112
All I want is a little more

679
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:39,907
A little longer with you

680
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:45,120
Never felt like this before

681
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:48,624
The way I feel with you

682
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,210
I can do anything

683
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:53,378
Anything I feel like

684
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:55,297
And you'll take care of it

685
01:33:58,217 --> 01:33:59,927
I don't even have to think

686
01:34:03,222 --> 01:34:04,765
I've never felt like this

687
01:34:09,228 --> 01:34:10,896
But I'm being very selfish

688
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:12,773
You'll be in trouble

689
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,567
They thought we were in Calcutta

690
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,487
Now they'll know we're here

691
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:23,408
Nothing can save us now?

692
01:34:28,789 --> 01:34:29,915
All ruined

693
01:34:39,508 --> 01:34:40,300
What now?

694
01:34:44,304 --> 01:34:45,556
We sit on top

695
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:50,018
On the roof

696
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,020
Coming?

697
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:58,777
- Let's decide the next move
- You talk too much

698
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:38,400
Wrapped in clouds of white wool

699
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:47,576
I am like the winter breeze

700
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:52,539
Not caring what's left behind

701
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:55,000
Not seeing what lies ahead

702
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:58,503
I ask myself

703
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:04,927
Where am I?

704
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:37,668
Finding myself amidst lost desires

705
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:50,389
Firm desires, shaky pursuits

706
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:57,020
In all of this...

707
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:02,317
...where am I?

708
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:48,405
What are you staring at?

709
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:52,659
You like the mountains or the sea?

710
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,246
I've never seen the sea

711
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:00,334
I like the mountains more, too

712
01:38:01,585 --> 01:38:02,669
Like that one

713
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,672
It is calling out to me

714
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,467
Wish we could go there

715
01:38:12,846 --> 01:38:13,930
Then come

716
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:18,226
We'll go there?

717
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:20,395
Got other plans?

718
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:24,524
Let's go

719
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:49,299
For one second

720
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:07,359
Are you done? Give it back

721
01:39:09,778 --> 01:39:11,530
Enough. Pass it here

722
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:13,824
It has power, boss

723
01:39:17,285 --> 01:39:19,287
I'll give you a tight slap

724
01:39:22,541 --> 01:39:25,710
It's not a toy. Give it to me

725
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,046
Tell me something

726
01:39:29,423 --> 01:39:31,591
One bullet and one man is finished?

727
01:39:34,177 --> 01:39:35,387
Two are finished

728
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:39,850
The one who gets shot

729
01:39:42,269 --> 01:39:43,687
And the one who shoots

730
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:48,775
It's a bad thing

731
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,862
So why don't you throw it away?

732
01:39:52,571 --> 01:39:53,822
Why keep it?

733
01:39:54,364 --> 01:39:56,366
What the hell do you know?

734
01:39:58,994 --> 01:40:00,287
I can see

735
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,252
We won't fight

736
01:40:08,462 --> 01:40:09,421
No fighting

737
01:40:12,549 --> 01:40:14,634
Don't talk about such things

738
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:17,637
Again?

739
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:21,016
Let's go

740
01:40:23,185 --> 01:40:24,769
Let's race

741
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:33,148
I wanted a home on
a mountain like this

742
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,567
Always wanted one

743
01:42:37,444 --> 01:42:38,320
My home

744
01:42:38,695 --> 01:42:39,738
My dream

745
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,240
Pick any mountain you like

746
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:43,950
They're all ours

747
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:45,452
Really?

748
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:47,537
Yes, they belong to us

749
01:42:48,038 --> 01:42:50,332
They'll be here
whenever you come back

750
01:42:50,707 --> 01:42:53,043
- I'm choosing one
- Sure, go ahead

751
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:39,876
Keep this

752
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,338
This is my dream home

753
01:45:44,047 --> 01:45:46,007
Exactly how I want it

754
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:49,052
We're saved so much work

755
01:45:57,894 --> 01:45:59,229
It's ok?

756
01:45:59,938 --> 01:46:02,899
Be comfortable. The
owners won't be back soon

757
01:46:06,528 --> 01:46:07,445
Hungry?

758
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,407
Ten minutes. I'll make something

759
01:46:11,658 --> 01:46:13,910
Go freshen up and just relax

760
01:46:14,536 --> 01:46:15,954
Leave it. I'll do it

761
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:18,998
This is my home Now out!

762
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:20,500
Who's denying it?

763
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:22,502
Let me clean up

764
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:39,787
Come!

765
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:53,676
- What is it?
- One minute

766
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,464
This can never be mine

767
01:49:14,048 --> 01:49:16,926
I've come so far away

768
01:49:19,887 --> 01:49:21,764
20 years

769
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:31,190
Everything will be all right

770
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:32,942
Amma

771
01:49:33,693 --> 01:49:35,653
Everything is over

772
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:42,035
I was once a mother's adored son

773
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:27,426
Mahabir, where's your gun?

774
01:53:27,677 --> 01:53:29,637
- I threw it away
- Veera Tripathi?

775
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:31,931
Stay away!

776
01:53:33,266 --> 01:53:34,475
Back off!

777
01:53:42,483 --> 01:53:43,359
Get back!

778
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:50,199
It's all ok

779
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:54,870
What the hell did you
shoot? Bastard! Why shoot?

780
01:53:55,121 --> 01:53:56,914
What was he doing?

781
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:01,836
Move back

782
01:54:01,836 --> 01:54:03,713
I'll kill everyone

783
01:54:05,381 --> 01:54:06,799
Veera, there's no time

784
01:54:07,258 --> 01:54:09,260
He'll die. He needs a hospital

785
01:54:09,552 --> 01:54:11,387
Nothing will happen to him

786
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:13,097
We have to take him immediately

787
01:54:18,102 --> 01:54:19,145
Let's go

788
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:27,528
Listen to me. I'll
take you to your village

789
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:30,740
To Amma

790
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:33,284
I said everything
will be ok. Didn't I?

791
01:54:33,826 --> 01:54:35,453
Nothing has changed

792
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:38,205
lam telling you.
Nothing has changed

793
01:54:38,414 --> 01:54:39,874
See for yourself

794
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:53,804
I know what you're thinking

795
01:54:54,138 --> 01:54:56,349
But you know nothing

796
01:54:58,476 --> 01:55:00,311
The important thing
is we save Mahabir

797
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:02,313
Save Mahabir

798
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:04,523
He kidnapped me

799
01:55:04,982 --> 01:55:07,693
But it's not what it
seems. Quite the opposite

800
01:55:07,902 --> 01:55:08,861
What's happened, child?

801
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:10,071
Nothing's happened

802
01:55:11,322 --> 01:55:12,698
I am fine

803
01:55:13,074 --> 01:55:14,575
Who is this man?

804
01:55:15,451 --> 01:55:16,869
I am fine

805
01:55:18,454 --> 01:55:20,164
- Let go
- Easy!

806
01:55:25,127 --> 01:55:27,755
What's that for? An injection?

807
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:30,049
Papa, listen to me. Please

808
01:55:30,633 --> 01:55:32,510
You don't understand

809
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:35,721
Wait. One second

810
01:55:36,097 --> 01:55:38,933
There's something I must tell you

811
01:55:39,767 --> 01:55:41,477
Stop

812
01:55:46,107 --> 01:55:48,234
Why don't you understand?

813
01:55:48,984 --> 01:55:52,238
What have you done? You don't get it

814
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:21,142
He died on the spot. Around 9.30

815
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:23,602
Before we could get
him on the stretcher

816
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:28,399
Can we take Veera back to Delhi?

817
01:56:33,028 --> 01:56:35,823
- Where's the body?
- In the mortuary

818
01:56:36,407 --> 01:56:38,117
- The post-mortem?
- Done, sir

819
01:56:41,996 --> 01:56:43,664
Mahabir Bhaati?

820
01:57:00,055 --> 01:57:02,475
I'll prepare the injection

821
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:36,550
Vinay's mom wants to see you

822
01:57:37,176 --> 01:57:38,802
Be nice

823
01:57:40,596 --> 01:57:41,972
Be pleasant

824
01:57:43,224 --> 01:57:44,642
Like everything was normal

825
01:57:45,142 --> 01:57:46,894
What do you think, Veera?

826
01:57:47,311 --> 01:57:49,563
In which city should
we have the wedding?

827
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,486
Convenient for everyone

828
01:58:14,547 --> 01:58:17,049
Every winter they
say: "It's so cold"

829
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:20,302
Every summer: "Oh
my God. It's too hot"

830
01:58:21,387 --> 01:58:22,972
Why is it such a surprise?

831
01:58:24,431 --> 01:58:25,808
Oh! What is it?

832
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,440
Why are you coming down?

833
01:58:41,574 --> 01:58:43,367
Do join us

834
01:59:07,099 --> 01:59:08,058
And you?

835
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,395
We're fine

836
01:59:11,979 --> 01:59:16,066
Just worried about you.
Hope you'll get better soon

837
01:59:18,861 --> 01:59:20,821
She looks much better

838
01:59:35,961 --> 01:59:39,465
I found my home on a mountain

839
01:59:41,717 --> 01:59:43,302
I cooked food

840
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:46,972
I cleaned my house

841
01:59:50,100 --> 01:59:51,602
Then the bullet was fired

842
01:59:52,728 --> 01:59:54,355
Vinay loves the mountains, right?

843
01:59:55,064 --> 01:59:58,233
That Austrian resort?
You know Veera's favorite

844
01:59:59,401 --> 02:00:04,114
I always said that...
I would run away

845
02:00:05,407 --> 02:00:07,701
I don't want to live in the city

846
02:00:09,286 --> 02:00:10,913
Doesn't everyone say that?

847
02:00:11,789 --> 02:00:13,457
But who runs away?

848
02:00:15,042 --> 02:00:16,627
I wouldn't have either

849
02:00:19,922 --> 02:00:23,050
If Mahabir hadn't kidnapped
me and taken me away

850
02:00:27,346 --> 02:00:28,555
But now...

851
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,102
I'm gone

852
02:00:36,063 --> 02:00:38,065
I cannot come back

853
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:43,112
I think you should rest

854
02:00:44,530 --> 02:00:45,698
It's so strange

855
02:00:48,409 --> 02:00:50,160
I was kidnapped

856
02:00:52,538 --> 02:00:54,498
But I was free there

857
02:00:57,376 --> 02:00:59,002
I'm in prison here

858
02:01:04,049 --> 02:01:04,800
Come, Veera

859
02:01:06,135 --> 02:01:07,594
ls this my home?

860
02:01:13,016 --> 02:01:14,852
No chocolates today, Uncle Shukla?

861
02:01:15,519 --> 02:01:17,354
I'll order some now

862
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:19,356
Where?

863
02:01:22,735 --> 02:01:24,194
Where will you give them to me?

864
02:01:25,821 --> 02:01:27,865
Here? Or in the bathroom?

865
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,742
Enough of this

866
02:01:31,785 --> 02:01:34,621
Yes, Mummy? Something
you want to say?

867
02:01:36,999 --> 02:01:39,835
I don't know what
she's talking about

868
02:01:41,587 --> 02:01:42,588
Can't remember?

869
02:01:43,547 --> 02:01:44,631
Let me remind you

870
02:01:46,008 --> 02:01:47,217
"My princess...

871
02:01:48,302 --> 02:01:51,513
"You're most beautiful
girl in the world. My doll"

872
02:01:53,474 --> 02:01:54,516
Now remember?

873
02:01:55,267 --> 02:01:56,643
With your hands...

874
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:59,938
...how you'd cover my mouth

875
02:02:04,151 --> 02:02:07,863
So my screams could not be heard

876
02:02:12,534 --> 02:02:14,161
All my screams

877
02:02:16,163 --> 02:02:18,540
My cries of pain

878
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:21,919
To keep my screams silent

879
02:02:22,294 --> 02:02:24,922
You forced my mouth shut. Hush

880
02:02:31,136 --> 02:02:32,304
In the bathroom...

881
02:02:33,096 --> 02:02:34,640
Again and again

882
02:02:35,474 --> 02:02:36,683
The running tap

883
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:37,976
Where were you, nurse?

884
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:40,187
She's really gone crazy

885
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:41,605
They are right

886
02:02:41,939 --> 02:02:45,359
I was screaming. I was 9

887
02:02:47,236 --> 02:02:49,404
That hand was over my mouth

888
02:02:50,155 --> 02:02:52,699
My cries were silenced. No one heard

889
02:03:36,535 --> 02:03:37,411
It happens

890
02:03:39,288 --> 02:03:40,956
These things happen all the time

891
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:44,501
So you know what?

892
02:03:45,919 --> 02:03:47,379
I'm not ok with it

893
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:49,840
This world...

894
02:03:51,383 --> 02:03:52,843
...where this happens

895
02:03:54,761 --> 02:03:59,850
Where you can't tell
a lie from the truth

896
02:04:02,144 --> 02:04:03,687
Everything is mixed up

897
02:04:05,606 --> 02:04:07,858
There's so much confusion

898
02:04:32,633 --> 02:04:35,177
Be careful when you go out

899
02:04:36,470 --> 02:04:38,305
Strangers are bad

900
02:04:40,015 --> 02:04:42,351
A girl should always be careful

901
02:04:46,396 --> 02:04:48,106
Why didn't you ever say...

902
02:04:49,149 --> 02:04:52,069
...l should be careful
inside the house too?

903
02:04:54,363 --> 02:04:57,074
That I should also
protect myself from you

904
02:04:58,867 --> 02:05:00,577
Why didn't you ever tell me?

905
02:05:02,704 --> 02:05:05,374
I was so exposed here

906
02:05:05,999 --> 02:05:07,584
Inside my own home

907
02:05:10,253 --> 02:05:12,547
So I don't want to be sensible

908
02:05:13,757 --> 02:05:16,593
I am foolish. I'm bad

909
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:20,180
But I am not one of you

910
02:05:25,435 --> 02:05:27,270
I will not come back

911
02:05:59,302 --> 02:06:01,972
Admire the diamond...

912
02:06:03,265 --> 02:06:06,018
...that endures the
blows of a hammer

913
02:06:18,822 --> 02:06:23,368
The deceitful cannot
hide their flaws

914
02:07:14,002 --> 02:07:17,798
Do not display your diamonds
at a vegetable market

915
02:07:24,096 --> 02:07:29,101
Keep them close to your
heart and go your way

916
02:08:41,256 --> 02:08:45,844
If the sun shines on a rainy day

917
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:51,474
Shadows fall and rise

918
02:08:52,392 --> 02:08:58,982
I make a wish and
you appear before me

919
02:08:59,232 --> 02:09:01,193
Play with me

920
02:09:01,735 --> 02:09:05,113
Distances vanish

921
02:09:05,405 --> 02:09:08,366
You are with me. Day and night

922
02:09:08,617 --> 02:09:11,995
The shadows tell me

923
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:15,540
You are with me. Day and night

924
02:09:17,375 --> 02:09:20,795
0 my companion

925
02:09:21,129 --> 02:09:24,883
You are with me at every step

926
02:09:28,428 --> 02:09:32,140
We are one

927
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:42,192
O companion of mine
