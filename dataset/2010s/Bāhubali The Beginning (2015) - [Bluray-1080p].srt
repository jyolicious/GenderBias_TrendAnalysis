2
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:43,377
"Golden dreams
and great heartache,"

3
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:54,960
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river...called life."

4
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:07,002
"When great mountains lay
in its path,"

5
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:19,502
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock...to keep flowing!.."

6
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:38,377
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life..."

7
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:45,627
"it is called
the river of life."

8
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:37,502
Lord Shiva!

9
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,002
For all the sins
I have committed,

10
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,585
if death is the only redemption,
then take my life!...

11
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:49,502
But this boy should live...

12
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:54,668
He should live for his mother
who is waiting for him...

13
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:57,877
he should live to ascend
the throne Maharishi...

14
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,627
Mandrake Bali should live!

15
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:35,710
Dear me!

16
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:43,252
Hey! What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

17
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,627
Hey! Be careful!

18
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:15,252
What happened?
- I am not sure, master.

19
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:16,668
With all the jewelry on her,

20
00:09:16,668 --> 00:09:18,168
she must have been
a queen or something.

21
00:09:18,168 --> 00:09:20,460
She died with her
hand pointing up!

22
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:25,127
Master!

23
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:29,377
What happened?

24
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:31,168
They must have come
here to kill her.

25
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,752
Looks like she got
the better of them.

26
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,627
Master!

27
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,377
Oh my God! A cave!

28
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:45,752
We never knew this existed!

29
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:50,335
Looks like it goes all the way
to the top of the mountain!

30
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:53,627
If the lady was holding the
baby up, pointing to the top,

31
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,543
Maybe she wanted us
to take it back there!

32
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:57,002
You are out of your mind?

33
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:59,627
They sent soldiers
to kill an infant!

34
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,002
What dangers do
you think await him...

35
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,002
if you send him back there!
- But, Sang..

36
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:06,002
This is my baby.

37
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:08,002
I have no children...

38
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,877
and the river Goddess
has given this boy to me.

39
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:15,002
If anyone of you object,
I will trample upon your necks.

40
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,377
What are you waiting for?
Close the cave.

41
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:30,502
Shiva!

42
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,377
Shiva!

43
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:38,502
What are you doing here,
my dear?

44
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:40,335
What is up there, mother?

45
00:10:48,668 --> 00:10:50,793
There are ghosts
and demons up there!

46
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,918
They prey on
and eat little kids!

47
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,752
But I want to go up there,
mother!

48
00:10:54,918 --> 00:10:57,210
Don't ever say you want
to go up there! Let us go.

49
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:19,252
How many times have I told you
not to climb up there?

50
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:21,002
Why do you keep doing it?

51
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:23,710
You are my darling, right?
You won't do it again, right?

52
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,752
Looks like he will
make it this time.

53
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:20,168
No way!
Look at the water mountain!

54
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,627
It goes way up into the clouds...

55
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:22,877
...And how many times has he fallen
from that hundred feet?

56
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:23,752
He always slips and falls
after the first hundred feet.

57
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,502
Yeah, he slipped and fell
at least a hundred times.

58
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:28,252
Watch!
He is going to come sliding down again.

59
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,502
Shiva!

60
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:08,210
Your mother is up to something there!

61
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:16,335
'Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!'

62
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:18,627
That is fifteen!

63
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,752
Pour another 101 times and
your prayers will be answered!

64
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:27,002
Sage, if I do this,
will my son listen to me?

65
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:29,252
Will he stop trying to climb
up that mountain?

66
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:32,127
Of course!
This is a powerful ritual!

67
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,127
Pour this water over Shiva,
with all your heart,

68
00:13:35,877 --> 00:13:38,627
and He will guide your son
onto the right path.

69
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:40,877
Alright! 0! Sage.
- Hail Shiva!

70
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,627
Mother, you are not
getting younger, are you?

71
00:13:45,377 --> 00:13:47,502
It won't help you if you
run around so much!

72
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:50,002
Out of my way!
- Mother, please listen to me!

73
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,502
Why should I?
Do you ever listen to me?

74
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,377
Father, can you please
tell her to stop?

75
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,377
Sang?
- What?

76
00:13:57,793 --> 00:14:00,043
Where are the flowers?
- Father! Father!

77
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:01,002
Let go of me!

78
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:03,627
Alright! Let me do it on your behalf.
Okay?

79
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:06,502
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

80
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:10,127
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water!

81
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,627
Sire, carry on with what you are doing.
- Hail Lord Shiva!

82
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:16,377
Mother.
- What is it now?

83
00:14:16,668 --> 00:14:18,752
How about I carry you...

84
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,918
and you can pour the water
over Lord Shiva? Fine?

85
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:23,252
No way!
Lord Shiva won't accept it.

86
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:25,752
The one who took the oath
will have to pour the water

87
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:27,877
and she has to walk up
to pour the water!

88
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,627
Sage, are you and your Shiva
planning to kill my mother?

89
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:37,002
How should I know what
the Lord has in store?

90
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:45,627
Lord Shiva!

91
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:48,668
Sang!

92
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,877
See what your lad is up to now!

93
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,752
What is it this time?

94
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,877
Shiva, stop!

95
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:06,752
You will go to hell for this
blasphemy! Shiva, stop!

96
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:13,377
Shiva.

97
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:32,002
Shiva, wait..

98
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:38,877
"The celestial river agitatedly
moving through His matted hair"

99
00:15:39,043 --> 00:15:44,127
"which makes His head shine
with those soft waves."

100
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:53,752
"And His forehead shining
like a brilliant fire"

101
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,002
"and the crescent of moon which
is an ornament to His head"

102
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:59,335
"makes my mind love Him
each and every moment."

103
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:08,585
"Who is he and
where he comes from?

104
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:13,752
"He brought with him eternal
light spreading everywhere."

105
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:18,252
"His strong arms can turn
the tide of history."

106
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:22,043
"River Birthrate, Lord Shiva
head towards you."

107
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:27,002
"Look at this great irony."

108
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:59,877
"The consort of the sportive
daughter of the mountain"

109
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:06,335
"whose mind rejoices
at Her side long glances."

110
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:12,043
"With the stream of merciful
look which removes hardships"

111
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:14,377
"Makes my mind
take pleasure in Him"

112
00:17:14,543 --> 00:17:18,085
"who wears the directions
as apparel."

113
00:17:19,377 --> 00:17:21,918
"With the lustrous gem"

114
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,293
"on the serpent's hood
in His matted locks."

115
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,627
"He, who is with His bride
whose face is decorated"

116
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:30,002
"by the melting of
red saffron vermillion."

117
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:36,543
"And who wears on His shoulder
the hide of the elephant"

118
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:39,043
"which was blind
with ferociousness."

119
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,418
"Makes my mind happy
and contented in Him"

120
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,835
"who is the leader of demons."

121
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:05,877
Mother!

122
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,377
Not just a thousand
showers for your Lord,

123
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:11,877
He will bathe all the time now.
Are you happy now?

124
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,252
Yes..

125
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,752
Sage, it played out
just like you predicted!

126
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:21,502
My son hasn't looked up
at that waterfall since.

127
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:24,502
Do you ever underestimate
Lord Shiva's power?

128
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:28,377
But now he sits staring
at the wooden mask

129
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,502
that fell on the Shambling
from above.

130
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,960
Now what is with that?

131
00:19:35,418 --> 00:19:38,877
Lord Shiva works
in mysterious ways.

132
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,502
Only He would know.

133
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:41,668
A small doubt.

134
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:43,752
Since my son was
the one who made sure

135
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:45,335
the idol is bathed
all the time.

136
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,002
Will his wish of climbing
up the mountain come true

137
00:19:48,168 --> 00:19:49,502
or will Sang’s
wish of him always

138
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,793
staying down here come true?

139
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:54,502
To hell with your doubts.
My son did what he did for me!

140
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:57,752
My wish will be fulfilled.
Isn't that right?

141
00:19:58,502 --> 00:20:03,043
Lord Shiva does whatever
He thinks. Hail Lord Shiva!

142
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,877
Hail Lord Shiva!

143
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:06,752
What did he say?

144
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:15,002
Shiva!

145
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:17,293
How long are you going
to sit holding that wooden mask?

146
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,627
There is somebody up there.

147
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:22,252
Maybe there is, but your mother
is calling out to you.

148
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,752
Let us go home.
- Go ahead. I will come later.

149
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:26,252
Let us go, boys.

150
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:33,085
Who are you?
Why did you come to me?

151
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:48,252
"My heart is lost."

152
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:55,377
"Like a drop in the waves."

153
00:21:55,793 --> 00:22:01,252
"I am the one whose
eyes shine amidst the stars"

154
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,002
"I am the one who
sings amidst the waterfalls"

155
00:22:05,168 --> 00:22:09,877
"My voice echoes through
streams, listen to me!"

156
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:16,335
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

157
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,502
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

158
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:28,752
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

159
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:35,752
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

160
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,752
"I breathe for you..."

161
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,877
"and only you"

162
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:18,752
"Come and let us live together."

163
00:23:19,377 --> 00:23:24,335
"Let me tell you something,
my love."

164
00:23:26,168 --> 00:23:31,752
"I chose you as my soul mate."

165
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:38,627
"Whether I stumble and fall,
with haste I will come."

166
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:43,002
"I am but a sudden gust of wind.
I stop for no one."

167
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:51,127
"I will break free of every
mountain in no time."

168
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:55,835
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

169
00:23:57,377 --> 00:24:02,085
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

170
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:08,252
"He is strong and without an
equal adversary who can fight."

171
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:14,877
"His anger will cause
new fears in his foes."

172
00:24:56,668 --> 00:25:08,585
"You come out of blue
with a gift of love."

173
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:14,627
"Drop a word and I swear"

174
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:20,835
"I will give up my life for you."

175
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:28,627
"Scaling peak impossible, his
blood flows like a rivulet."

176
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:34,835
"His sturdy body, a weapon.
Hail this hero of the world."

177
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:41,252
"Destructive in the air and sky
can win with his roar of war."

178
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:47,460
"A ferocious warrior will become
soft-hearted afterwards."

179
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:50,752
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

180
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:53,877
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

181
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:57,252
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

182
00:25:57,252 --> 00:26:00,002
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

183
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,252
"Killer of fear.
Ocean of wealth."

184
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,918
"Arduous struggle over,
healing calm sets over him."

185
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:10,752
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

186
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:17,335
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

187
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:23,752
"The persevering one, your
bravery will take you forward."

188
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:29,960
"You leap higher and higher,
firm and stable and determined."

189
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,252
"The persevering one.."

190
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:37,252
"Hey, warrior. Come closer!"

191
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:45,502
"Hey, handsome. You are mine."

192
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:48,835
Hey!

193
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:53,377
Hey! Stop!

194
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,627
Stop!

195
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:15,002
Over there!

196
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:37,752
Kasi!

197
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,252
It is a trap. Kill them!

198
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:19,502
Dear God!

199
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:41,168
How come you got this?

200
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:44,418
One of your men,
sneaked into our kingdom.

201
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:48,127
He tried to rescue Devasena.
We killed him.

202
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:51,585
It was tied to his wrist.
I took it from him.

203
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:53,502
I don't know anything else.

204
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,877
Let me go! Let me..

205
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:07,585
Bury the dead
and leave no traces.

206
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:50,377
Dilip too has attained
martyrdom, chief!

207
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:06,877
Don't let the drop of tear
breach your eyelids.

208
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:12,002
That monster from the palace
has imprisoned our princess

209
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,710
and has her shackled
right in the town square.

210
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:26,710
Our Queen Devasena being
treated like cattle in a fair.

211
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:37,793
Our pride and honor is injured
and we suffer in silence.

212
00:31:37,793 --> 00:31:41,085
It is not time to shed tears.

213
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:43,252
It is time to breathe fire.

214
00:31:46,043 --> 00:31:48,377
Have you forgotten
your solemn oath?

215
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:51,293
We will remember it
till our last breath.

216
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:52,377
To meet our goal

217
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,752
we will clash with thunder..
- We won't lose courage.

218
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:57,127
Come hell or high water..
- We will be brave!

219
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:59,293
Or death that splits us in pieces..
- We won't budge!

220
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:00,877
We shall rescue Devasena!

221
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:07,252
If we are to achieve our goal..

222
00:32:20,918 --> 00:32:23,502
"Attachments become
our weakness..."

223
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:26,502
"and there is no place for
joy or celebrations."

224
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,877
"Our body is for our lost
Motherland, Atalanta Kingdom..."

225
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,127
"and soul exists
only to free Devasena."

226
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:40,585
My leader...

227
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,293
I heard many good things
about a warrior...

228
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,210
called Kappa of Maharishi.

229
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:49,335
I heard he is a good man.
Couldn't we ask him to help?

230
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,627
Kalahari Kappa Narmada.

231
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:54,002
He is indeed a good man.

232
00:32:54,752 --> 00:32:57,460
He can help us if he wants to.

233
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,960
But he won't...

234
00:33:02,877 --> 00:33:06,627
Kappa is a slave
the throne of Maharishi.

235
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,877
Kappa.

236
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:21,377
A sword trader, Sheik Slam Khan
from Kabul is here to see you.

237
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:37,127
The ore is extracted from
the depths of Baghdad mines.

238
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,252
Purified in the furnaces
of the Golan mountains.

239
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,752
Crafted by the best
blacksmiths in Persia.

240
00:33:46,543 --> 00:33:48,627
With this in hand...

241
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,627
even a child can slice
through ten banyan trees.

242
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,502
I call this the Islander.

243
00:33:59,127 --> 00:34:00,377
The Pride of Swords.

244
00:34:07,377 --> 00:34:08,960
A wonderful sword.

245
00:34:09,252 --> 00:34:13,127
But forgive me, Slam,
this cannot match our speed.

246
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,252
How insulting!

247
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:24,752
Spoken words and spilled blood
can never be taken back.

248
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:30,377
Duel with my sword and
prove the worth of your words.

249
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,377
Does that prove
my point, Kappa?

250
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,627
I have traveled
across the world

251
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:28,460
China, Persia, Mongolia, Greece.

252
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,127
But never seen
a warrior like you.

253
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:34,960
It will be an honor
to break bread with you.

254
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,960
Please come, Kappa.
- Please forgive me, Slam.

255
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:42,793
Slaves here do not
dine with royal guests.

256
00:35:42,793 --> 00:35:43,877
Slave?

257
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:49,877
You are the head of the armory,
how can you be a slave?

258
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:52,627
Yes, Slam. A slave
like you have never seen before.

259
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:54,710
He forges the weapons for war.

260
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:58,002
During war, he must protect
the king with his own life.

261
00:35:58,418 --> 00:36:01,502
After the war,
he should still lay by his feet.

262
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:08,377
Tell me, what will it cost
to buy your freedom?

263
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:12,627
I will pay 10, even 100 times that
to buy your freedom.

264
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:16,377
You cannot put a price
on this slave, Slam.

265
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:20,627
My ancestors pledged that
everyone born in our clan...

266
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:24,335
will serve the throne
of Maharishi for life.

267
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:27,502
For a pledge that
a long forgotten ancestor made

268
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:29,502
you still..

269
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:31,627
People who made the pledge
might be dead

270
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:35,002
but their word
still lives on, Slam.

271
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:39,752
For this life, these bonds
will stay tied to this land.

272
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:45,585
If loyalty has a face,
it is you, Kappa.

273
00:36:47,168 --> 00:36:48,877
If you ever need anything...

274
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,877
please don't ever forget that
you have a life-long friend.

275
00:37:17,043 --> 00:37:18,252
Alisha.
- Hmm.

276
00:37:20,418 --> 00:37:22,085
Where are you going?
- I will be right back.

277
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:10,877
We have a golden opportunity

278
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:12,752
to fulfill the oath
we have taken.

279
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:16,252
They are celebrating
Bhallaladeva's birthday

280
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:18,210
on the next new moon.

281
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:21,252
The entire kingdom will be busy
with the celebrations.

282
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,752
The opportunity to
free Queen Devasena...

283
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:29,627
Give me the opportunity, sir!
- Chief, let me go!

284
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,127
I offer it to Avanthika,
this time.

285
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:37,710
Avanthika!

286
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:51,127
What is this, Avanthika?

287
00:39:54,502 --> 00:39:55,877
Where did this come from?

288
00:39:57,043 --> 00:40:00,460
You focused on your beauty
more than your oath!

289
00:40:02,252 --> 00:40:06,585
You cannot put your life at stake
since you love yourself so much.

290
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,752
You are not worthy
of this honor. Leave us.

291
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:24,127
These tears are not
a reflection of my cowardice

292
00:40:25,627 --> 00:40:27,960
nor do they come from pain.

293
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:34,502
They are a testament
to my boiling blood.

294
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:39,377
If you can feel their intensity

295
00:40:41,543 --> 00:40:43,085
then let me go.

296
00:40:52,252 --> 00:40:54,835
You have to leave in two days.
So get ready.

297
00:40:55,293 --> 00:40:57,627
Be careful and get
the job done, Avanthika.

298
00:40:57,793 --> 00:41:00,002
If you get caught because
of your own neglect...

299
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:03,460
Bhallaladeva will torture you
mercilessly before he kills you.

300
00:41:32,252 --> 00:41:40,877
"Our Maharishi Kingdom
shall remain unconquerable."

301
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:50,960
"As long as the sun, moon
and stars are shining there."

302
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:09,877
"Felicity and glory
reigns supreme here."

303
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:16,793
"A flourished kingdom,
happy subjects"

304
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:21,377
"and the home of peace."

305
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:40,502
"May the glory of Mahishmathi
soar sky high."

306
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:44,418
"Our flag with the emblem
of the rising sun"

307
00:42:44,418 --> 00:42:48,752
"our golden throne
flanked by to stallions."

308
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:18,043
Your Majesty,
it is just been two days since

309
00:43:18,043 --> 00:43:19,877
we caught that bull
in the forests.

310
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:23,377
We haven't broken it yet.
It is quite dangerous...

311
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:24,960
Minister!

312
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:31,210
It would take 10 such bulls
to intimidate Bhallaladeva.

313
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:33,502
Please come.

314
00:44:35,627 --> 00:44:36,877
Stamp it out, Bhalla!

315
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:41,460
Yes!

316
00:44:47,627 --> 00:44:48,710
Kill him, father.

317
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:02,252
Did you see, grandfather?

318
00:45:02,627 --> 00:45:04,460
His Majesty overpowered
the bull.

319
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:06,627
Glory to the king!

320
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,627
That was a great feat..

321
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:12,627
Bravo, Your Majesty!

322
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,752
Bhallaladeva!

323
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:51,502
Father!

324
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:53,210
He did it!

325
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,502
Have you ever seen a mightier warrior!
- No, Prince!

326
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:07,752
Your loyalty amuses me,
Kappa.

327
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:12,168
I know deep in your heart...

328
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:14,460
you nurture this
desire to kill me.

329
00:46:16,918 --> 00:46:19,960
Yet you put your life
on the line to save mine.

330
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:21,710
How do you do it?

331
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:24,377
How do you manage to do this?

332
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:28,127
Alright! You deserve it!
Ask for a reward.

333
00:46:30,293 --> 00:46:31,877
Ask for anything!

334
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:35,710
Your Majesty!

335
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:41,627
You have been holding Devasena
captive for 25 years.

336
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,627
Please release her.

337
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:53,585
So be it.
Since I have given my word.

338
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:58,002
Go and kill Devasena
and release her!

339
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:06,127
There is no greater liberation
than death! Go and release her!

340
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,627
No?

341
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:13,210
Then let her suffer.

342
00:47:14,377 --> 00:47:17,377
Not just another 25 years,
but till she dies.

343
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:56,585
Hey old hag! Get up!

344
00:48:04,293 --> 00:48:05,585
Hey! Get up.

345
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:49,252
Hey Devasena! I hope there is
nothing lacking in your torture!

346
00:48:52,418 --> 00:48:55,752
You chose him over me.

347
00:48:57,293 --> 00:48:59,460
So where is he now?

348
00:49:01,377 --> 00:49:04,002
Tell me the truth, Devasena.

349
00:49:04,752 --> 00:49:06,543
In all these years...

350
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:11,252
have you ever heard
anyone even utter his name?

351
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:17,585
On those long and dark night,
amid the desperate silence...

352
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:21,002
and in the clunk
of your shackles...

353
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:23,502
did you ever hear his name?

354
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:29,585
No.

355
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:34,127
Maharishi has forgotten him,
Devasena.

356
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:37,085
They neither talk
about him anymore...

357
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,627
and nor do they remember him.

358
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:44,377
There are only two people in
this kingdom that remember him.

359
00:49:45,252 --> 00:49:47,002
You and I.

360
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:51,252
You remember him as you want
to see him before you die.

361
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:55,127
And I remember him
as I want to kill him again...

362
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:56,752
with my bare hands.

363
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:01,877
But both our wishes
will remain unfulfilled.

364
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,627
Lady Devasena!

365
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,710
At least, accept it now.

366
00:51:26,252 --> 00:51:27,627
You just have to say yes...

367
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:30,127
and I will break these shackles
and set you free.

368
00:51:32,543 --> 00:51:34,752
Do you want to be a prisoner
for all your life?

369
00:51:37,252 --> 00:51:38,627
No, Kappa.

370
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:44,460
My son will come
and he will set me free.

371
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:48,960
How can your dead child
come back for you?

372
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:51,252
My son is alive.

373
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:55,252
He will come looking for me!

374
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:57,502
You are suffering
in the name of a son...

375
00:51:57,502 --> 00:52:00,210
who is no longer alive,
My Lady!

376
00:52:01,627 --> 00:52:03,752
Please get a grip on yourself.

377
00:52:03,752 --> 00:52:07,127
I won't get a chance
like this once again.

378
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:11,127
The guards on the night shift
will be here any moment.

379
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,377
Please agree!

380
00:52:13,668 --> 00:52:15,252
Please accept it.

381
00:52:16,543 --> 00:52:20,877
I am begging you and you
keep doing these silly things!

382
00:52:32,418 --> 00:52:37,710
Do you think I am picking twigs
like a mad woman, Kappa?

383
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,877
This is a funeral pyre!

384
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:50,252
This is for a funeral pyre
to burn to ashes...

385
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:55,002
the body and the
blood of Bhallaladeva.

386
00:52:58,293 --> 00:52:59,877
My son will come...

387
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,252
he will drag that animal...
and place him on this pyre.

388
00:53:03,752 --> 00:53:06,252
My son will make me
light the pyre...

389
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:08,627
while Bhalla is still alive.

390
00:53:09,418 --> 00:53:12,127
The death cries of
Bhallaladeva will reverberate...

391
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:16,210
beyond the walls
of Maharishi.

392
00:53:17,418 --> 00:53:19,377
My son will come!

393
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,377
What happened, Avanthika?

394
00:53:34,877 --> 00:53:38,002
Someone right here tattooed
my hand last night.

395
00:53:39,918 --> 00:53:43,127
He will come back
once he sees me.

396
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:31,710
Avanthika?
What is on your shoulder?

397
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:43,793
Avanthi..
- Go ahead, I will see you later!

398
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:45,085
Avanthi, listen!

399
00:56:10,877 --> 00:56:13,377
You saw the painting on your shoulder?
Did you like it?

400
00:56:15,418 --> 00:56:17,877
Why that sour face?
Can you smile a little?

401
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:32,127
Oh My God!

402
00:56:32,418 --> 00:56:34,377
Hey! What is with the arrows?

403
00:56:34,377 --> 00:56:36,085
You want to kill
this hunk of a man!

404
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:41,127
Who are you?
- That is better.

405
00:56:41,127 --> 00:56:43,168
My name is Shiva.
I come from village Ambuli.

406
00:56:43,168 --> 00:56:44,752
I climbed this huge
mountain just for you..

407
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:51,335
What a girl!

408
00:57:16,418 --> 00:57:20,752
See, you should listen.
Now you are in a hole.

409
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:25,252
Avanthika?

410
00:57:34,543 --> 00:57:37,877
Now tell me who are you?
- I am telling the truth.

411
00:57:37,877 --> 00:57:39,335
I climbed up the mountain..
- Shut up.

412
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:42,377
It is possible only for the
likes of the great Lord Shiva!

413
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:44,127
That is what I am saying.
I am Shiva!

414
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:51,710
I will tell you.
I will tell you everything.

415
00:57:53,752 --> 00:57:57,543
But before that I have
to ask you one thing. - What?

416
00:57:57,543 --> 00:58:02,252
Who are you? Who are you?

417
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:10,502
You got a sword in your hand.

418
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:14,085
Not to mention body armour, anger
sparks flying from your eyes.

419
00:58:14,793 --> 00:58:17,335
I am not asking about
this mask of yours!

420
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:21,377
I want to know the one
that is hidden beyond it.

421
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,210
Shall I tell you?

422
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:33,210
You are a woman and I am a man.

423
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:37,627
I have come here to love you.

424
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:18,960
Now that hurts.

425
01:01:29,377 --> 01:01:30,627
This is mine.

426
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:33,960
I dropped it near the waterfall.

427
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:41,710
Did you really scale
the mountains to reach me?

428
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:45,085
Just for me?

429
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:50,127
I came all the way just to see
the smile behind the mask.

430
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,877
I still don't see it.

431
01:02:18,377 --> 01:02:23,627
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

432
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:29,377
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

433
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:36,252
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

434
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:41,502
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

435
01:02:41,502 --> 01:02:46,502
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

436
01:02:46,502 --> 01:02:51,127
"But now I want to live for you."

437
01:02:51,543 --> 01:02:56,502
"I made a pact with my heart."

438
01:02:56,668 --> 01:03:01,877
"I will be born a hundred times
for you."

439
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:06,752
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

440
01:03:06,918 --> 01:03:12,752
"Let there be thirst for love
and let our love grow",

441
01:03:33,668 --> 01:03:38,377
"I will write our love saga
on the skies."

442
01:03:38,793 --> 01:03:43,377
"Let us be together for
the rest of our lives."

443
01:03:43,627 --> 01:03:53,627
"Write it with your eyes and
make my heart your canvas."

444
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:57,752
"Being in love is so lovely."

445
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:03,127
"The life I lived all
these years has no value"

446
01:04:03,127 --> 01:04:08,168
"But now I want to live for you."

447
01:04:08,168 --> 01:04:17,877
"I made a pact with my heart. I will be
born a hundred times for you."

448
01:04:18,543 --> 01:04:23,418
"Birds chirp and ask you
to take me along."

449
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:28,502
"I am growing thirsty for love,
let there be love."

450
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:33,877
"Listen to what
my heart echoes."

451
01:04:33,877 --> 01:04:39,627
"Let the time stand still
and while love makes us alive."

452
01:05:01,918 --> 01:05:05,627
This is something
the world has never seen.

453
01:05:05,793 --> 01:05:08,585
A hundred foot
tall golden statue.

454
01:05:08,918 --> 01:05:11,585
Even the Gods don't
get this honor.

455
01:05:12,002 --> 01:05:13,835
Once this is erected,

456
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:17,002
your son,
our King Bhallaladeva's prestige...

457
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:19,335
will live on forever
in the entire world.

458
01:05:21,043 --> 01:05:24,918
Are all the arrangements done?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

459
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:27,002
There will be celebrations galore.

460
01:05:27,168 --> 01:05:30,877
The applause and the din
will be unprecedented, My Lord!

461
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:56,627
Avanthika..

462
01:06:34,543 --> 01:06:35,835
Frisk her!

463
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:12,752
Attack!

464
01:08:13,252 --> 01:08:14,835
Baahubafin

465
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:21,627
My Lord! Forgive me, My Lord!
Please don't kill me!

466
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:25,752
My Lord! Forgive me, my Lord.

467
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:34,960
Forgive me.

468
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:14,002
Shiva!

469
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:06,335
Please forgive me, Shiva.

470
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:09,002
I didn't know what else to do.

471
01:11:10,168 --> 01:11:13,460
I cannot let go of you
nor can I abandon my duty..

472
01:11:14,043 --> 01:11:15,877
You are mine, Avanthika.

473
01:11:16,877 --> 01:11:19,002
Everything that is yours
is mine.

474
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,127
I also share your obligation.

475
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,752
I don't know who Devasena is.

476
01:11:36,377 --> 01:11:38,460
If your goal is to free her

477
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,335
then I will bring her back!

478
01:11:44,418 --> 01:11:45,752
This is my word.

479
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:55,752
"The pyre is lit and
I feel choked."

480
01:11:55,752 --> 01:11:59,627
"Nevertheless there is a
yearning in my heart"

481
01:12:00,502 --> 01:12:09,877
"Will there be sunrise again,
ask these shackles of mine?."

482
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:14,460
"O Kingdom! see who
comes your way."

483
01:13:14,168 --> 01:13:17,877
Maharishi,
you can breathe now.

484
01:13:18,918 --> 01:13:20,835
My son is back.

485
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:23,502
Bali is back!

486
01:14:44,377 --> 01:14:45,668
When the king's statue
is erected...

487
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:47,002
everyone must applaud!

488
01:14:48,043 --> 01:14:49,168
When the king's statue
is erected

489
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:50,585
everyone must applaud!

490
01:15:36,043 --> 01:15:37,460
No worries!

491
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:39,877
It is a hundred foot statue.

492
01:15:39,877 --> 01:15:42,502
Won't it take a sacrifice
of a hundred heads?

493
01:16:45,002 --> 01:16:46,127
Thank you.

494
01:16:57,002 --> 01:16:58,460
Baahubafin

495
01:16:59,793 --> 01:17:03,043
Baahubafi?
- Bali.

496
01:17:03,043 --> 01:17:05,627
Bali!
- Bali!

497
01:17:05,627 --> 01:17:13,127
Bali! Bali!

498
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,543
Move it!
- Bali! Bali!

499
01:17:15,543 --> 01:17:25,002
Bali! Bali!

500
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:28,585
Bali! Bali!

501
01:17:33,627 --> 01:17:37,585
Bali! Bali!

502
01:17:40,043 --> 01:17:41,252
Hey!

503
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:43,127
Who was that?

504
01:17:47,418 --> 01:17:49,877
Bali! Bali!

505
01:17:50,043 --> 01:17:52,752
Bali! Bali!

506
01:18:23,377 --> 01:18:25,627
Bali! Bali!

507
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:37,627
Bali! Bali!

508
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,377
Bali!

509
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:07,002
Bali! Bali!

510
01:19:07,168 --> 01:19:09,877
Bali! Bali!

511
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:13,127
Bali! Bali!

512
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:53,710
It is been fifteen days
since my son left! - Hold this.

513
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:55,627
He hasn't returned yet.

514
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:57,627
I wonder if he is alright.

515
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,502
Our son carried Lord Shiva's idol
all by himself,

516
01:19:59,668 --> 01:20:00,502
What can happen to him?

517
01:20:00,752 --> 01:20:03,002
If he is alright,
why isn't he back?

518
01:20:03,168 --> 01:20:05,627
Maybe he found his family.

519
01:20:05,793 --> 01:20:07,877
He must have realized
we are his foster parents.

520
01:20:08,043 --> 01:20:10,835
Will he never come? Will he not
call me mother again? - Sang.

521
01:20:11,043 --> 01:20:12,877
People, hurry up, will you?

522
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:28,002
Come on.

523
01:20:36,543 --> 01:20:38,127
Earlier you saw the fire
in my eyes and

524
01:20:38,293 --> 01:20:40,210
trusted me to
carry out the mission.

525
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,502
Once again I request you
to have that belief in me.

526
01:20:44,293 --> 01:20:48,460
I know Shiva will rescue
Queen Devasena. Come with me.

527
01:20:51,252 --> 01:20:51,752
Alright!

528
01:20:56,668 --> 01:21:00,752
"Mahasena!"

529
01:21:05,752 --> 01:21:07,252
Who says that Bali,

530
01:21:07,418 --> 01:21:10,002
the one who showed us the
righteous path is no more?

531
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:19,127
I am nothing, but a living dead.

532
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:24,460
You are dead and yet you are
alive in people's heart.

533
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:33,752
Bali! Bali!

534
01:21:34,918 --> 01:21:38,585
The echo still lingers
in these walls.

535
01:21:39,377 --> 01:21:44,752
It felt like it was his statue
that was being erected!

536
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:48,252
Did the people express their
bottled-up feelings?

537
01:21:52,502 --> 01:21:54,752
Or did they see someone?

538
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:57,585
No! Impossible!

539
01:21:59,168 --> 01:22:01,585
Let us question the soldiers on duty...

540
01:22:01,752 --> 01:22:02,960
as to who uttered the name
and why they did so!

541
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,210
Then the truth will come out,
grandfather.

542
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:46,210
What are you doing here?

543
01:22:46,377 --> 01:22:48,210
L.. - The king has ordered us
to come. Let us go.

544
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:04,627
Who first uttered the
name of Bali in the crowd?

545
01:23:09,502 --> 01:23:12,210
Am I talking to these walls?

546
01:23:12,418 --> 01:23:15,627
Speak! Or I will have
your tongues cut!

547
01:23:16,293 --> 01:23:20,252
I didn't see who, My Lord!
- Stop it!

548
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,835
Bunch of idiots as you are!
Didn't anyone of you see him?

549
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,460
I saw him, My Lord!

550
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:17,585
I have seen those eyes before!

551
01:24:18,793 --> 01:24:22,877
Bhadra! I want him alive.
- Let us go!

552
01:24:37,252 --> 01:24:38,877
Hey, who are you?

553
01:24:55,543 --> 01:24:57,127
He is here! Catch him.

554
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:09,377
Catch him..

555
01:25:33,877 --> 01:25:34,960
That way..

556
01:26:32,293 --> 01:26:33,460
Sound the alarm!

557
01:26:50,543 --> 01:26:52,127
I have come to rescue you.

558
01:26:54,043 --> 01:26:56,752
Kappa, a marauder
has entered the palace

559
01:26:57,002 --> 01:26:58,585
and he set fire
to the King's chambers!

560
01:26:58,752 --> 01:27:00,252
You head north.

561
01:27:18,627 --> 01:27:21,752
Kappa, Chop off his legs and hands
but I want him alive.

562
01:27:22,002 --> 01:27:24,627
As you say, My Prince!
- I want him alive!

563
01:27:27,502 --> 01:27:28,710
Come on!

564
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,002
The alarm!

565
01:28:47,293 --> 01:28:48,502
Attack!

566
01:29:50,293 --> 01:29:52,710
Get up!

567
01:29:55,043 --> 01:29:57,002
You lousy old hag!

568
01:29:59,418 --> 01:30:01,210
All these years of punishment...

569
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:03,127
for your infidelity
and still no shame!

570
01:30:05,627 --> 01:30:09,627
The moment you see a man,
you take off with him!

571
01:31:17,002 --> 01:31:19,460
Kappa! He is going to kill me!
He is going to kill me!

572
01:31:19,627 --> 01:31:21,002
My Prince!

573
01:31:21,168 --> 01:31:23,460
It is my duty to protect you!

574
01:31:25,918 --> 01:31:28,460
To get to you,

575
01:31:30,752 --> 01:31:32,335
he has to go through me first!

576
01:32:39,668 --> 01:32:40,877
Kappa!

577
01:32:42,252 --> 01:32:43,460
Kappa!

578
01:32:54,377 --> 01:32:55,502
Devasena!

579
01:32:58,668 --> 01:32:59,835
Attack!

580
01:33:00,002 --> 01:33:02,502
They are going for Devasena.
Stop them.

581
01:33:02,668 --> 01:33:04,335
Hail Maharishi!

582
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:37,627
Shiva!

583
01:33:43,043 --> 01:33:44,377
Siddha!

584
01:33:56,793 --> 01:34:00,002
"Mahasena!"

585
01:34:03,627 --> 01:34:06,627
"Mahasena!"

586
01:34:11,543 --> 01:34:14,377
"Mahasena!"

587
01:35:13,293 --> 01:35:14,710
Anila!

588
01:35:58,502 --> 01:36:02,502
Bali!

589
01:37:27,377 --> 01:37:30,002
You resurrected our lost hope.

590
01:37:30,252 --> 01:37:31,710
You made a great
warrior out of him

591
01:37:31,877 --> 01:37:33,002
and brought him back to us.

592
01:37:33,168 --> 01:37:38,377
Kingdom of Maharishi will be
eternally grateful to you.

593
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:57,877
My mother looks at me

594
01:37:58,752 --> 01:38:00,877
with this sadness and
not the usual affection.

595
01:38:04,502 --> 01:38:06,127
I don't know
who they are...

596
01:38:06,293 --> 01:38:08,002
and yet they look at me like
lam their God!

597
01:38:10,627 --> 01:38:12,752
And when I see the wounds
that fester on that lady...

598
01:38:13,293 --> 01:38:15,127
I have never met before,

599
01:38:16,793 --> 01:38:21,127
my blood boils and
my soul hurts! Why?

600
01:38:22,502 --> 01:38:23,752
Who am I?

601
01:38:25,168 --> 01:38:29,877
You are the son of our savior (God)
Amarendra Bali.

602
01:38:31,293 --> 01:38:34,085
You are the balm
for your mother Devasena

603
01:38:34,293 --> 01:38:36,002
who awaited your return
for 25 years.

604
01:38:37,877 --> 01:38:39,502
You are the fruit of our

605
01:38:39,668 --> 01:38:43,377
Queen Mother Sivagami's
ultimate sacrifice.

606
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:47,377
<i>The story you need to know
began 50 years ago, my son.</i>

607
01:38:47,627 --> 01:38:49,877
<i>This kingdom of Maharishi
was established</i>

608
01:38:50,043 --> 01:38:53,002
<i>by your grandfather
Maharaja Vikramadeva.</i>

609
01:38:53,168 --> 01:38:56,085
<i>Though elder,
Bijjaladeva was not crowned</i>

610
01:38:56,252 --> 01:38:58,252
<i>because of his conniving nature.</i>

611
01:38:58,418 --> 01:39:03,627
<i>But Bijjaladeva blamed it only
on his physical disabilities</i>

612
01:39:04,127 --> 01:39:07,210
<i>and it caused
great turmoil in him.</i>

613
01:39:08,627 --> 01:39:12,210
<i>The King died.</i>

614
01:39:12,793 --> 01:39:15,877
<i>He was survived by his subjects</i>

615
01:39:16,043 --> 01:39:19,210
<i>and the queen
who was six months pregnant.</i>

616
01:39:19,377 --> 01:39:23,127
<i>Three months passed by and
Maharishi continued to mourn.</i>

617
01:39:23,377 --> 01:39:26,835
<i>The King's sister-in-law
and Bijjaladeva's wife, Sivagami</i>

618
01:39:27,002 --> 01:39:30,627
<i>took up the reins of the kingdom.</i>

619
01:39:31,752 --> 01:39:33,210
<i>Being an astute woman</i>

620
01:39:33,377 --> 01:39:35,252
<i>she focused on
the welfare of the people</i>

621
01:39:35,418 --> 01:39:37,502
and defense
of the kingdom.

622
01:39:38,668 --> 01:39:41,502
<i>She could hear
the howls of the jackals</i>

623
01:39:41,668 --> 01:39:44,127
<i>making their move
towards the throne.</i>

624
01:39:45,252 --> 01:39:50,752
<i>It was a dark new moon night.
The queen was in labour.</i>

625
01:39:57,877 --> 01:40:00,002
We could not save the queen,
My Lady!

626
01:40:05,043 --> 01:40:06,252
It is a boy!

627
01:40:31,668 --> 01:40:32,877
Bali!

628
01:40:38,668 --> 01:40:43,127
The empty throne reminds
me of a widow's forehead.

629
01:40:43,293 --> 01:40:46,502
So, I will take the throne and
restore it to its former glory!

630
01:40:46,668 --> 01:40:48,502
Hail him!

631
01:40:48,752 --> 01:40:52,752
You all swore a solemn oath
to be loyal to this throne.

632
01:40:52,918 --> 01:40:55,377
A revolt at a time
when the kingdom mourns

633
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:58,335
goes against every tenet
of being a Kshatriya, Marthanda!

634
01:40:58,502 --> 01:41:00,252
Being a leader
is the first tenet

635
01:41:00,418 --> 01:41:02,127
of being a Kshatriya,
Minister.

636
01:41:12,418 --> 01:41:13,835
Lady Sivagami?

637
01:41:34,043 --> 01:41:38,085
All those who support this
royal family step to one side.

638
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:41,127
Who will support a woman,
Sivagami?

639
01:41:52,293 --> 01:41:53,627
Kappa!

640
01:41:57,752 --> 01:42:00,835
They have soiled Maharishi
with their revolt.

641
01:42:01,543 --> 01:42:03,460
Wash it off with their blood!

642
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:13,877
How can you stand and watch...

643
01:42:14,043 --> 01:42:15,585
while our people
are being hacked to death?

644
01:42:18,418 --> 01:42:22,460
Move! Kill that
slave and Sivagami!

645
01:42:23,793 --> 01:42:25,710
Kill Kappa!

646
01:42:44,127 --> 01:42:48,335
You bribed and bought my people!
How conniving!

647
01:42:51,627 --> 01:42:55,710
Not conniving, Marthanda.
It is called the statecraft!

648
01:43:11,377 --> 01:43:14,210
Lady, you are a born
statesman and a warrior

649
01:43:14,377 --> 01:43:15,877
and we had the privilege to witness it.

650
01:43:16,043 --> 01:43:19,627
Please ascend the throne
and rule Maharishi!

651
01:43:19,793 --> 01:43:23,002
No, Minister.
That is not my place.

652
01:43:23,168 --> 01:43:26,627
Then whose is it? O!Lady!
- What kind of a question is that, minister?

653
01:43:26,793 --> 01:43:31,377
It belongs to my son,
Bhallaladeva.

654
01:43:31,543 --> 01:43:33,002
Tell him, Sivagami!

655
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:57,377
Both my sons have
a right to the throne.

656
01:43:58,002 --> 01:44:03,752
The one with more valour,
compassion and wisdom

657
01:44:03,918 --> 01:44:05,877
will be crowned
the king of Maharishi.

658
01:44:07,793 --> 01:44:11,002
This is my word
and my word is the law!

659
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:26,210
"You found in her
an ocean of affection."

660
01:44:27,627 --> 01:44:38,002
"May you live long,
my dear Bali."

661
01:44:48,418 --> 01:44:53,752
"Ambrosia and venom."

662
01:44:55,543 --> 01:45:02,877
"Mind is where
they both get churned."

663
01:45:15,168 --> 01:45:19,127
"The scion of Mahishmathi"

664
01:45:19,293 --> 01:45:23,877
"the heir to the throne
the only one.. Bali."

665
01:45:27,043 --> 01:45:31,002
"He roars like a lion in the
battlefield." - Rest for now.

666
01:45:31,252 --> 01:45:34,710
"He is nothing,
but a thunderstorm."

667
01:45:42,043 --> 01:45:44,210
Kappa! I am very hungry.

668
01:45:44,418 --> 01:45:45,835
Can I have some?

669
01:45:46,002 --> 01:45:47,252
My Prince!

670
01:45:48,043 --> 01:45:50,127
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

671
01:45:52,752 --> 01:45:54,085
Now give me some.

672
01:45:55,127 --> 01:45:57,835
My Prince!, your mere
presence here is wrong.

673
01:45:58,002 --> 01:45:59,960
And then to sit with us
to break bread?

674
01:46:00,918 --> 01:46:03,460
I am hungry.
Your lectures won't help me.

675
01:46:04,293 --> 01:46:05,627
There is a spread
of delicacies ready

676
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:07,085
for you in your
royal chambers.

677
01:46:07,293 --> 01:46:09,877
I know. What is wrong
with this food?

678
01:46:10,043 --> 01:46:12,085
Just the aroma is
making my mouth water.

679
01:46:12,252 --> 01:46:14,502
You know what is wrong,
My Prince.

680
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:17,710
You are royalty
and we are slaves.

681
01:46:17,877 --> 01:46:21,377
Alright! As the Prince
of Mahishmathi, I command you.

682
01:46:24,043 --> 01:46:25,252
Feed me, uncle.

683
01:47:00,877 --> 01:47:03,127
"Now has risen the sword
that will condemn."

684
01:47:03,293 --> 01:47:05,502
"Now flies the arrow
that will pierce."

685
01:47:05,668 --> 01:47:07,835
"His enemies remain astonished."

686
01:47:08,002 --> 01:47:14,877
"They don't know where
to run or hide."

687
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:47,627
Bhallaladeva!

688
01:47:59,127 --> 01:48:00,585
Great Bhalla!

689
01:48:01,668 --> 01:48:04,627
When I become the King,
you will be my commander!

690
01:48:28,418 --> 01:48:30,502
Both the princes
have excelled

691
01:48:30,668 --> 01:48:32,127
in their training as
warriors and scholars.

692
01:48:32,293 --> 01:48:34,085
They stand as equals.

693
01:48:34,377 --> 01:48:39,710
How are you going to decide who
will be crowned, Queen Mother?

694
01:48:41,793 --> 01:48:44,835
God has blessed both my
children with equal strengths.

695
01:48:45,002 --> 01:48:47,002
Now he is testing me

696
01:48:47,168 --> 01:48:50,877
with the difficult decision
I have to make!

697
01:48:51,043 --> 01:48:54,752
Make their next challenges
much more difficult.

698
01:49:06,793 --> 01:49:09,710
<i>Before she could decide
on who will ascend the throne</i>

699
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,877
<i>the Queen Mother was
faced with a new crisis.</i>

700
01:49:13,043 --> 01:49:16,252
<i>In the form of one
of their trusted Saketa.</i>

701
01:49:19,043 --> 01:49:23,002
Saketa killed the guards
and stole our military secrets.

702
01:49:25,418 --> 01:49:27,752
Call for the Princes!
- As you wish.

703
01:49:28,418 --> 01:49:31,002
<i>The young Princes searched</i>

704
01:49:31,168 --> 01:49:34,002
<i>for the traitor
in neighbouring kingdoms.</i>

705
01:49:34,168 --> 01:49:36,627
<i>Finally they found out
that he was hiding</i>

706
01:49:36,877 --> 01:49:38,752
<i>in a den of thieves
called Singapuram.</i>

707
01:49:38,918 --> 01:49:40,335
<i>It is a lawless place
where bandits</i>

708
01:49:40,502 --> 01:49:41,752
<i>thieves and murderers
gathered and mingled.</i>

709
01:49:41,918 --> 01:49:44,252
<i>Strangers who drew
attention to themselves</i>

710
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:47,502
<i>were in mortal danger.</i>

711
01:49:57,168 --> 01:49:59,960
I have never seen you before.
- I just got here.

712
01:50:00,127 --> 01:50:02,377
A hidden dagger! What is it for?

713
01:50:02,543 --> 01:50:03,877
Are you a SPY?

714
01:50:10,418 --> 01:50:12,627
If our guards were this good..

715
01:50:12,793 --> 01:50:14,002
We wouldn't have
had the opportunity

716
01:50:14,168 --> 01:50:15,627
to see so many
different Kingdoms.

717
01:50:18,293 --> 01:50:19,960
Swords or smarts?

718
01:50:20,127 --> 01:50:21,585
Whichever is sharper.

719
01:50:29,627 --> 01:50:30,960
Do you have a drink?

720
01:50:38,418 --> 01:50:39,502
Big one?

721
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:50,377
Much bigger?

722
01:50:58,002 --> 01:50:59,252
Do you have money?

723
01:51:08,293 --> 01:51:11,377
I need something large enough
for all my brothers!

724
01:51:31,043 --> 01:51:33,002
Look what is happening there..

725
01:51:33,168 --> 01:51:34,335
Come on!

726
01:51:39,168 --> 01:51:42,210
Not just booze.
There is a lot more here.

727
01:52:06,293 --> 01:52:11,335
"Intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

728
01:52:12,293 --> 01:52:17,335
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

729
01:52:18,293 --> 01:52:24,085
"Let your lips find mine."

730
01:52:24,293 --> 01:52:30,002
"Come and steal
myself from me."

731
01:52:30,252 --> 01:52:34,710
"You are the charming one."

732
01:52:36,168 --> 01:52:41,002
"You are the charming one."

733
01:52:42,293 --> 01:52:45,127
"Your words are as
intoxicating as a bunch"

734
01:52:45,293 --> 01:52:48,127
"of ripe grapes
soaked in honey."

735
01:52:48,293 --> 01:52:53,710
"You know way to my heart,
you are the key to my soul."

736
01:52:54,293 --> 01:52:56,877
"Let me drink
this love potion."

737
01:52:57,043 --> 01:53:00,127
"You are mine, just mine."

738
01:53:00,293 --> 01:53:05,252
"intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

739
01:53:06,293 --> 01:53:12,002
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

740
01:53:48,293 --> 01:53:53,960
"Take me in your strong arms,
I want to live."

741
01:54:00,252 --> 01:54:05,877
"You got the magic,
no one has."

742
01:54:12,293 --> 01:54:18,127
"You are something
I want to lose myself in."

743
01:54:18,293 --> 01:54:24,252
"I want to be your
and make you mine, too."

744
01:54:24,668 --> 01:54:28,377
"Come and enjoy me."

745
01:54:30,168 --> 01:54:34,502
"You are the charming one."

746
01:54:34,668 --> 01:54:35,960
"Yes, I am."

747
01:54:36,127 --> 01:54:41,127
"You are the charming one."

748
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:45,127
"Don't shoot me
with love daggers."

749
01:54:45,293 --> 01:54:47,627
"Please listen to me, my love."

750
01:54:48,377 --> 01:54:51,127
"Let me drink
this love potion."

751
01:54:51,127 --> 01:54:54,293
"You are mine, just mine."

752
01:54:54,293 --> 01:54:59,752
"intoxication tonight,
your magic gets me high."

753
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:05,752
"Your love surrounds me,
my love."

754
01:56:13,668 --> 01:56:16,752
Instead of being
tortured by you, I should..

755
01:56:16,918 --> 01:56:18,002
Bhalla!

756
01:56:51,252 --> 01:56:53,085
Kappa..

757
01:57:23,252 --> 01:57:26,877
Who did you sell our secrets to?
Tell me!

758
01:57:27,377 --> 01:57:28,877
Kalakeya!

759
01:57:32,752 --> 01:57:35,085
The Kalakeyas don't believe
in tactical attack.

760
01:57:35,668 --> 01:57:38,210
There is no limit
to their morbidity.

761
01:57:39,418 --> 01:57:41,627
If they barge into the kingdom

762
01:57:42,627 --> 01:57:45,002
they will kill every
innocent child

763
01:57:46,293 --> 01:57:49,377
and violate every woman.

764
01:57:50,543 --> 01:57:53,252
They will destroy
and burn everything.

765
01:57:54,377 --> 01:57:57,210
This talk might scare
some small kingdoms.

766
01:57:57,543 --> 01:57:59,377
We have a standing
army of 25,000 soldiers.

767
01:57:59,543 --> 01:58:00,877
Why should we be scared?

768
01:58:01,502 --> 01:58:05,585
How big is the Kalakeya army?
- One hundred thousand.

769
01:58:42,293 --> 01:58:44,460
When wild bulls barge into the crops

770
01:58:44,627 --> 01:58:49,460
and lands that the Kalakeyas
plunder, are both left barren.

771
01:58:58,418 --> 01:59:00,877
We have to defend our kingdom

772
01:59:01,627 --> 01:59:03,752
and we have to attack our
enemies at the same time.

773
01:59:04,293 --> 01:59:06,502
What military strategy
should we use to attack?

774
01:59:07,418 --> 01:59:08,752
"The trident strategy".

775
01:59:12,418 --> 01:59:17,085
It is one for the textbooks.
No one has ever used it.

776
01:59:17,293 --> 01:59:19,627
You want to go to war
with something untested?

777
01:59:19,793 --> 01:59:21,460
If no one has used it

778
01:59:21,627 --> 01:59:23,835
the Kalakeyas wouldn't
expect it either.

779
01:59:24,002 --> 01:59:26,210
That is why
we should implement it.

780
01:59:26,377 --> 01:59:29,627
I second the plan.
- I approve it.

781
01:59:30,752 --> 01:59:34,502
It is the only way
into our kingdom.

782
01:59:34,668 --> 01:59:40,002
Kappa, how big a force
do you need to stop them?

783
01:59:40,543 --> 01:59:42,210
Five thousand, Your Highness!

784
01:59:42,918 --> 01:59:47,085
I will use armour and spears
to erect a wall of iron.

785
01:59:47,252 --> 01:59:49,835
I will turn it into an
impregnable fortress.

786
01:59:51,793 --> 01:59:54,585
I will command the forces
to the north.

787
01:59:57,293 --> 01:59:59,877
I will take responsibility
for the south.

788
02:00:02,168 --> 02:00:03,585
According to our sources,

789
02:00:03,752 --> 02:00:06,127
the Kalakeya chief
will stand back

790
02:00:06,293 --> 02:00:08,585
and send half
his army forward.

791
02:00:09,418 --> 02:00:12,335
Our military formation
and our weapons...

792
02:00:12,752 --> 02:00:15,960
will repel that kind
of attack for three hours.

793
02:00:16,418 --> 02:00:20,960
But we have to kill
the chief during that time.

794
02:00:21,127 --> 02:00:24,460
Their army,
without a chief, will scatter!

795
02:00:24,627 --> 02:00:27,127
In the middle of that battle

796
02:00:27,293 --> 02:00:29,502
both princes with
their cavalry

797
02:00:29,668 --> 02:00:32,502
will attack the Chief
from two sides.

798
02:00:32,668 --> 02:00:35,710
It will take them
at least three hours

799
02:00:36,252 --> 02:00:38,460
by the time they launch
a counter attack on us.

800
02:00:38,627 --> 02:00:41,127
That will be enough, mother.
Victory will be ours.

801
02:00:41,293 --> 02:00:45,002
Half that time will be enough
to behead him.

802
02:00:45,168 --> 02:00:48,252
Great! This will also
solve the conundrum

803
02:00:48,418 --> 02:00:50,502
of who should be the king.

804
02:00:52,793 --> 02:00:55,627
Yes! The one who kills
the Kalakeya chief

805
02:00:55,793 --> 02:00:58,002
will ascend the
throne of Mahishmathi!

806
02:00:59,793 --> 02:01:02,502
My Lord has
the perfect solution. - Yes.

807
02:01:05,752 --> 02:01:09,335
Divide the rest of the army
equally between the Princes!

808
02:01:11,418 --> 02:01:13,252
Bhalla, Baahu.

809
02:01:13,793 --> 02:01:16,835
This is the opportunity to
pay tribute to your motherland!

810
02:01:17,377 --> 02:01:18,627
Accept it.

811
02:01:20,043 --> 02:01:22,877
Hail Maharishi!
- Hail Maharishi!

812
02:01:27,043 --> 02:01:30,002
Your uncle has
treated you unfairly.

813
02:01:30,168 --> 02:01:34,335
He has only given you
tools to breach a fort.

814
02:01:34,793 --> 02:01:37,752
Of what use will those
be in an open battlefield?

815
02:01:38,793 --> 02:01:40,877
The arrow-machines
and the swords' chariot,

816
02:01:41,043 --> 02:01:43,002
all went to Bhallaladeva!

817
02:01:45,127 --> 02:01:47,252
You should have objected, Baahu!

818
02:01:50,793 --> 02:01:53,460
Your son shall ascend
the throne of Mahishmathi.

819
02:01:53,918 --> 02:01:57,085
You brilliantly hoodwinked
Bali! - What hoodwink?

820
02:01:57,543 --> 02:02:01,752
If he can't even demand the
right army, the right weapons

821
02:02:02,627 --> 02:02:05,002
what is he going to do
on the battlefield tomorrow?

822
02:02:06,543 --> 02:02:08,877
I made the strong one
even stronger.

823
02:02:09,627 --> 02:02:12,877
It is not cheating,
it is statecraft!

824
02:02:13,627 --> 02:02:16,252
Hey! Who is it?
- Forgive me, My Lord!

825
02:02:16,418 --> 02:02:17,835
The younger Prince
asked us to pull out

826
02:02:18,043 --> 02:02:19,585
the tents and
bring them to him.

827
02:02:52,293 --> 02:02:56,752

02:02:57,127 --> 02:03:02,377

(Sanskrit chants)

831
02:03:28,043 --> 02:03:31,252
Welcome, Bhallaladeva!

832
02:03:31,418 --> 02:03:34,127

(Sanskrit chants)

835
02:03:59,377 --> 02:04:02,377
Invincible!
- Invincible!

836
02:04:02,543 --> 02:04:05,252
Invincible!
- Invincible!

837
02:04:05,918 --> 02:04:08,127
Welcome, Bali!

838
02:04:13,168 --> 02:04:18,627
Bali! Bali!

839
02:04:18,793 --> 02:04:22,960
Bali! Bali!

840
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:25,252
Bali! Bali!

841
02:04:39,918 --> 02:04:42,960
Bahu, it is
a time-honored ritual.

842
02:04:43,127 --> 02:04:43,960
If you don't
sacrifice the animal

843
02:04:44,168 --> 02:04:46,252
the soldiers will read it as a bad omen.
- Yes, My Prince!

844
02:04:46,418 --> 02:04:48,502
If you don't offer the sacrifice

845
02:04:48,668 --> 02:04:50,002
the Goddess will be angry.

846
02:04:50,168 --> 02:04:51,835
Why quench the
Goddess's thirst with

847
02:04:52,043 --> 02:04:53,710
the blood of
this innocent animal

848
02:04:54,127 --> 02:04:56,502
when my own blood
can be offered?

849
02:04:59,293 --> 02:05:01,835
Hail Maharishi!
- Hail Maharishi!

850
02:05:02,002 --> 02:05:05,502
Hail Mahishmathi!
Hail Mahishmathi!

851
02:05:05,668 --> 02:05:07,960
Hail Mahishmathi!

852
02:05:08,168 --> 02:05:10,252
Hail Mahishmathi!

853
02:05:10,418 --> 02:05:13,877
Hail Mahishmathi!

854
02:05:21,793 --> 02:05:23,960
Mahishmathi will be
forgiving and benevolent!

855
02:05:26,627 --> 02:05:28,127
This is your last chance.

856
02:05:28,293 --> 02:05:31,585
Drop your weapons and run
and we will spare your lives.

857
02:05:46,668 --> 02:05:48,627
I heard that you promised
both your sons that

858
02:05:48,793 --> 02:05:51,335
the one who kills me
would be made king.

859
02:05:56,793 --> 02:05:59,502
And if both of them
die at my hands?

860
02:06:16,877 --> 02:06:19,502
I will conquer you
and your kingdom

861
02:06:19,668 --> 02:06:20,960
and then I will have
a son with you.

862
02:06:21,127 --> 02:06:22,710
You can make him the king!

863
02:06:31,627 --> 02:06:33,252
I want him alive.

864
02:06:34,293 --> 02:06:37,585
I want him to be alive
even after his arms and legs

865
02:06:37,752 --> 02:06:40,377
are cut off and he
lies in a pool of blood!

866
02:06:47,293 --> 02:06:52,127
When the vultures pluck out
his eyes and feast on his guts.

867
02:06:52,793 --> 02:06:54,752
He should be alive.

868
02:06:56,252 --> 02:06:58,085
Kappa!
<i>'</i> My Lady!

869
02:06:58,252 --> 02:07:00,335
Blow the conch
to begin the battle.

870
02:07:31,502 --> 02:07:32,752
It is ready.

871
02:07:32,918 --> 02:07:33,835
Arm the weapon.

872
02:07:39,627 --> 02:07:40,877
Fire!

873
02:07:46,793 --> 02:07:48,335
Baahubali's command!

874
02:08:15,918 --> 02:08:17,002
Get ready!

875
02:08:18,377 --> 02:08:20,210
Arm the weapons.

876
02:09:27,168 --> 02:09:28,335
Attack!

877
02:10:27,252 --> 02:10:29,377
Attack!

878
02:12:10,043 --> 02:12:12,835
Well done, Bali!
- Well done.

879
02:12:42,293 --> 02:12:44,252
Soldiers. Attack.

880
02:12:44,418 --> 02:12:45,960
Attack!

881
02:13:05,168 --> 02:13:07,752
Hold! Hold strong!

882
02:13:23,918 --> 02:13:25,752
Swords group, step forward!

883
02:15:29,918 --> 02:15:32,127
Trident strategy begins!

884
02:18:01,293 --> 02:18:02,585
Stop.

885
02:18:08,793 --> 02:18:10,002
Bhallaladeva!

886
02:18:15,752 --> 02:18:17,002
My Prince?

887
02:18:28,418 --> 02:18:30,335
My Prince!
- Army!

888
02:20:02,252 --> 02:20:05,252
Hold your lines!

889
02:20:13,043 --> 02:20:15,877
Hold your lines! Hold them!

890
02:20:59,918 --> 02:21:01,877
Our defenses are in tatters.

891
02:21:02,293 --> 02:21:04,460
We are seeing an enemy
flag on Maharishi soil...

892
02:21:04,627 --> 02:21:05,627
for the first time!

893
02:21:05,793 --> 02:21:08,210
This is the death of us. Death!

894
02:21:08,793 --> 02:21:11,460
Death! Death!

895
02:22:01,877 --> 02:22:03,127
Death!

896
02:22:06,418 --> 02:22:07,835
Death!

897
02:22:11,293 --> 02:22:12,627
Soldiers!

898
02:22:20,502 --> 02:22:22,085
What is death?

899
02:22:23,752 --> 02:22:26,085
To think that the
enemy is stronger

900
02:22:26,252 --> 02:22:27,877
than our resolve, is death!

901
02:22:29,752 --> 02:22:34,127
Cowardice on the battlefield
is death!

902
02:22:36,043 --> 02:22:40,502
The cruel man insulted our
mother and he is still alive.

903
02:22:42,418 --> 02:22:45,502
Instead of presenting his
decapitated head at her feet

904
02:22:45,668 --> 02:22:48,002
we are turning our backs
to him and that is death!

905
02:22:53,043 --> 02:22:56,127
I will ride on to annihilate
that death!

906
02:22:57,252 --> 02:23:01,335
No rogue can ever harm
my mother or my motherland.

907
02:23:01,543 --> 02:23:05,752
I am about to rip them apart
and proclaim my war cry!

908
02:23:11,168 --> 02:23:13,252
Who is with me?

909
02:23:15,293 --> 02:23:16,627
Me!

910
02:23:16,793 --> 02:23:19,627
Who will die with me?
- Me!

911
02:23:19,877 --> 02:23:24,627
Who will vanquish that
death and live on? - Me!

912
02:23:26,377 --> 02:23:27,627
Me!

913
02:23:27,793 --> 02:23:30,252
Hail Mahishmathi!

914
02:23:30,418 --> 02:23:32,377
Hail Mahishmathi!

915
02:23:32,627 --> 02:23:36,752
Hail Mahishmathi!

916
02:23:47,377 --> 02:23:49,002
Hail Mahishmathi!

917
02:23:50,543 --> 02:23:54,085
Hail Mahishmathi!

918
02:24:20,543 --> 02:24:21,752
Sethupathy!

919
02:29:13,793 --> 02:29:16,085
<i>I want him alive when
the vultures pluck out his eyes</i>

920
02:29:16,252 --> 02:29:18,752
<i>and feast on his guts.</i>

921
02:29:19,543 --> 02:29:24,252
<i>His limbs are to be cut off
and his blood should flow!</i>

922
02:29:48,668 --> 02:29:50,002
MY son!

923
02:29:51,627 --> 02:29:54,627
Bhallaladeva! Bhallaladeva!

924
02:30:17,752 --> 02:30:19,127
MY son!

925
02:30:19,877 --> 02:30:26,252
My brave son killed
Kalakeya and won the battle!

926
02:30:31,502 --> 02:30:35,502
To the future king,
Bhallaladeva!

927
02:30:35,668 --> 02:30:39,002
Hail Bhallaladeva!
Hail Bhallaladeva!

928
02:30:40,502 --> 02:30:42,877
Bhallaladeva's valour
will be told in Maharishi

929
02:30:43,043 --> 02:30:45,127
for generations to come!

930
02:30:45,752 --> 02:30:51,377
Tales of his victory will be
etched on shrines and temples.

931
02:30:51,918 --> 02:30:54,252
Today, I proclaim
my son Bhallaladeva

932
02:30:54,418 --> 02:30:57,752
as the commander of the
armed forces of Mahishmathi!

933
02:31:01,168 --> 02:31:05,127
I proclaim Bali
as the King of Mahishmathi!

934
02:31:13,793 --> 02:31:17,127
Sivagami,
What sort of a decision is this?

935
02:31:17,293 --> 02:31:22,252
My son, our son,
killed the Kalakeya chief!

936
02:31:22,418 --> 02:31:24,710
You saw it with your own eyes!

937
02:31:25,543 --> 02:31:29,085
He has to be the King! Only he!

938
02:31:29,543 --> 02:31:31,877
The merits of a King
are evaluated not

939
02:31:32,043 --> 02:31:33,835
by the number
of enemies he has killed

940
02:31:34,002 --> 02:31:36,502
but by the number of
his own people he has saved.

941
02:31:37,043 --> 02:31:38,002
During the battle

942
02:31:38,168 --> 02:31:41,127
Bhallaladeva's focus was
only in vanquishing the enemy.

943
02:31:41,377 --> 02:31:44,377
Bali,
while killing the enemy

944
02:31:44,543 --> 02:31:47,002
also managed
to save his subjects.

945
02:31:48,002 --> 02:31:50,877
That is the difference
between a soldier and a king.

946
02:31:53,168 --> 02:31:56,627
If you kill a hundred men you will
be called a great warrior.

947
02:31:57,293 --> 02:32:01,627
But if you save one life,
you will be called God!

948
02:32:05,377 --> 02:32:07,002
So, saving a couple
of common men

949
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:08,585
is now the
qualification to rule?

950
02:32:08,752 --> 02:32:11,127
Bali will be
crowned the King of

951
02:32:11,293 --> 02:32:13,377
Maharishi on
an auspicious day.

952
02:32:14,418 --> 02:32:17,877
That is my word
and my word is law!

953
02:32:22,168 --> 02:32:24,585
Bali! Bali!

954
02:32:25,168 --> 02:32:27,627
Bali! Bali!

955
02:32:27,793 --> 02:32:30,002
Bali! Bali!

956
02:32:30,252 --> 02:32:32,210
Bali! Bali!

957
02:32:32,377 --> 02:32:36,627
Bali!
-Bali!

958
02:32:36,793 --> 02:32:39,960
Bali! Bali!

959
02:32:40,127 --> 02:32:42,210
Bali! Bali!

960
02:32:52,752 --> 02:32:55,002
Amarendra Bali!

961
02:32:56,168 --> 02:32:59,752
Glory to him!

962
02:33:03,418 --> 02:33:06,627
Amarendra Bali!

963
02:33:07,252 --> 02:33:11,002
Glory to him!

964
02:33:11,252 --> 02:33:14,377
Glory to him!

965
02:33:16,627 --> 02:33:19,627
My Shiva is the son
of such a great king!

966
02:33:20,752 --> 02:33:23,460
We are so glad
to hear about him.

967
02:33:24,418 --> 02:33:27,627
I wish we can
see the great man once!

968
02:33:30,168 --> 02:33:31,585
He is no more.

969
02:33:33,293 --> 02:33:35,127
The saviour is no more!
(That God is no more!)

970
02:33:42,418 --> 02:33:44,627
You said no enemy
could come near him.

971
02:33:45,127 --> 02:33:47,377
You said the weapons
were afraid to touch him?

972
02:33:48,918 --> 02:33:51,002
How did such
a great warrior die?

973
02:33:52,918 --> 02:33:56,460
More grievous than
the wound of a sword or a spear

974
02:33:57,377 --> 02:33:59,127
is a stab in the back, Mandrake.

975
02:33:59,543 --> 02:34:02,252
Who? Who was it?

976
02:34:05,502 --> 02:34:06,877
That traitor...

977
02:34:09,127 --> 02:34:10,335
was me!

978
02:34:27,543 --> 02:34:38,502
"Golden dreams
and great heartache."

979
02:34:41,377 --> 02:34:51,502
"churn in the depth of the soul
of this river called life."

980
02:34:52,918 --> 02:35:02,835
"When great mountains
lay in its path."

981
02:35:04,627 --> 02:35:15,877
"it cuts deep gorges through
the rock to keep flowing!"

982
02:35:17,168 --> 02:35:33,377
"This unstoppable, inexhaustible
river called life."

983
02:35:35,127 --> 02:35:41,627
"it is called
the river of life."

984
