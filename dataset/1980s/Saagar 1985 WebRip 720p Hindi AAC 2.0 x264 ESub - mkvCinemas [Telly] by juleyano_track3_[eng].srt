1
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:04,105
Can't see Raja anywhere.
Where can he be?

2
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:08,685
Was I keeping a watch on him
all night at sea? He'll come.

3
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:11,106
There he comes, sir.

4
00:03:12,283 --> 00:03:13,639
Hey, Raja...

5
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,936
I was just asking about you.

6
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:18,324
Where were you?

7
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,950
Everybody came home, except you.
- Look over there, sir.

8
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,409
Nobody must've got such a haul!

9
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,757
Nobody's as good as you either.

10
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,120
Come and unload this stuff.
- Coming, sir.

11
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,445
Hey! Take your money.

12
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:37,724
You total it. I'll take it later.

13
00:03:40,727 --> 00:03:43,155
Cheena, what are you doing here?

14
00:03:44,616 --> 00:03:45,695
Have you eaten anything, or not?

15
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,689
Here, take this. Eat something.

16
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:59,065
Hi Johnny!
- Raja!

17
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:02,337
Your wedding, eh?
- Must come.

18
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:07,104
I'll just have a wash and come.
- Your house is this way.

19
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,512
I'll have a cup of tea first.

20
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:12,750
Hey! Come fast. We'll have fun!

21
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,148
What's this here?

22
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,732
You rascal!

23
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:17,821
Raja!
- Yes!

24
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:23,616
Come on... Come on now...
- I've come...

25
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,869
He ran away, damn it!
Did you have to come now?

26
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,518
You only called me.

27
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:36,452
I called the mouse, not you! Well?

28
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:40,133
Nothing. Just a cup of tea.
- No way!

29
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:41,384
Why not?

30
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:43,820
I've to get ready for
Maria's wedding as yet.

31
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,548
Even I've to go to it.
- Hey...

32
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:47,949
What?

33
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,899
I just cleaned up the place.
And look what you're doing.

34
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:53,076
Sorry.

35
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:57,805
I've been sitting up all night
in a little boat at sea...

36
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,501
And you... you refuse me
a cup of tea?

37
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,383
Okay. I'll just...

38
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,281
Alright. I'll give it to you.

39
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:09,262
Now sit properly first. Come on.

40
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:18,256
I won't spare you today.
I'll just get the poison.

41
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,245
Down! Get down! The other side!

42
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:27,981
You always bug me! Here!

43
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,604
Clean it up!

44
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,488
Mona...
- Don't ask for anything else.

45
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,346
Okay.

46
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,263
Papa!

47
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,318
What are you doing here, Raja?
Miss Joseph's looking for you.

48
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:44,515
I know.
We've to go to the wedding.

49
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,093
Oh no!
- Sorry.

50
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:47,532
What's that?
- Poison!

51
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,614
Poison?
- For the rats!

52
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,797
Mona, this...
- What is it?

53
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,385
The tea's fine, but without sugar.

54
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:58,125
Look you...
- No sugar in it...

55
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,988
What's the matter with me?
All this work together!

56
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:09,920
Johnny in the kitch. You're to get
wed. The mice want sugar. Mad!

57
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:15,310
Johnny in the kitch? I'm getting
married and mice want sugar?

58
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:20,381
Great! She's mixed all the 3
like milk, tea and sugar!

59
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,943
Sugar!
- Don't need it now.

60
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:40,977
This...

61
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:44,339
How did this get empty?
- It had sugar. I put it in tea.

62
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,397
This...

63
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:51,856
Why are you so worried?
I just put it in my tea.

64
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:56,428
And you... you drank it all up?

65
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:00,806
Then? Should I wash my face
and hands with it? Honestly!

66
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,493
But they adulterate even
the sugar nowadays!

67
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,931
Raja!

68
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,369
For God's sake! Go get ready.
I'll also go and get dressed.

69
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,586
This wasn't sugar, it was poison!

70
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,901
Poison?

71
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:18,866
No!

72
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,343
Mona.
- Yes.

73
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:24,256
You're not telling the truth
by any chance, are you?

74
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:29,985
That's what I was trying to say.
You drank poison!

75
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:34,191
Papa.
- Mona.

76
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:35,243
Raja!

77
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:39,872
I can't see properly...

78
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:43,955
But, I'm alright. Don't
you worry. I'm fine.

79
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:46,736
Raja.
- Mona.

80
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:49,129
Where are you?
- I'm here.

81
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,485
Raja!

82
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:57,605
Help! Mona, I'm feeling giddy.

83
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,816
Raja!

84
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,771
Raja!
- Help!

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,231
Help!

86
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,227
Sit.

87
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:12,157
Raja!
- This isn't the time to sit. I'm going...

88
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,551
I'm going...
- But where are you going?

89
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,987
Good bye, Mona!
- Good bye!

90
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,433
Hello God!

91
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,391
Raja!

92
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,135
Papa!

93
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:27,346
What's the matter, dear?
- What's happened, Raja?

94
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:33,262
Get up. Say something. The tea
had rat poison in it.

95
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:36,747
But what was it doing in the tea?
Mice don't drink tea!

96
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,930
Listen. I was in a hurry.
He asked for tea. So I...

97
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,895
I see.

98
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,998
You were in a hurry. He asked for
the tea, so you poisoned him!

99
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:49,921
What the hell have you done?
- I didn't poison him!

100
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,844
Who'll believe you?
The court needs proof.

101
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:57,746
It wants witnesses. And where
will we find a witness?

102
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:01,309
There's nobody here!
- I'll be a witness.

103
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:02,354
Will do.

104
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:05,558
He seems to be fine.
Raja... you're alright?

105
00:09:05,638 --> 00:09:08,117
You're safe?
- Yes, because...

106
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,996
the poison is in my hankie, not tea!

107
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,240
I'll not spare you today.

108
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,575
Mona, It was just a prank.
- Just you wait!

109
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,266
I'll teach you a lesson!

110
00:09:20,736 --> 00:09:22,869
I'll not spare you today.
I'll break your legs.

111
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,176
No!

112
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:58,022
"O Maria, O Maria..."

113
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,609
"O Maria, O Maria..."

114
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:09,465
"when Johny proposed
marriage to you..."

115
00:10:09,545 --> 00:10:13,531
"did he go down on his knees?
Tell me..."

116
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:18,928
"O Maria, O Maria..."

117
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,006
"O Maria, O Maria..."

118
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:29,731
"when Johny proposed
marriage to you..."

119
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:33,398
"did he go down on his knees?
Tell me..."

120
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:39,815
"O Maria, O Maria..."

121
00:10:40,196 --> 00:10:44,485
"O Maria, O Maria..."

122
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:20,900
"A spark must certainly been
ignited in your body?"

123
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:26,540
"Johny's word must surely have made
your heart skip a beat?"

124
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:31,210
"Were you quiet,
when he spoke...?"

125
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:36,409
"I'll ask Mummy"
Is that what you said?

126
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:41,225
"O Maria, O Maria..."

127
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:45,743
"O Maria, O Maria..."

128
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:52,349
"when Johny proposed
marriage to you..."

129
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:57,132
"did he go down on his knees?
Tell me..."

130
00:11:57,643 --> 00:12:01,734
"O Maria, O Maria..."

131
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:07,105
"O Maria, O Maria..."

132
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:27,776
"When Johny proposed to you..."

133
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:33,613
"were they days of summer?
Or nights of winter?"

134
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:38,232
"Did he say something weird?"

135
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,404
"Like being locked up
in a room together?"

136
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:48,678
"O Maria, O Maria..."

137
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,053
"O Maria, O Maria..."

138
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:59,670
"when Johny proposed
marriage to you..."

139
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,501
"did he go down on his knees?
Tell me..."

140
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,674
"O Maria, O Maria..."

141
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:13,725
"O Maria, O Maria..."

142
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:40,399
"Were you lost in thoughts,
as to how the wedding would go?"

143
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:45,311
"Or did Johny take
your hand in his?"

144
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:50,059
"When you said yes,
did he get closer..."

145
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:56,009
"and give you a tight hug,
with "Oh my darling...?"

146
00:13:56,233 --> 00:14:00,030
"O Maria, O Maria..."

147
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:05,124
"O Maria, O Maria..."

148
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,672
"when Johny proposed
marriage to you..."

149
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:16,100
"did he go down on his knees?
Tell me..."

150
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:21,220
"O Maria..."

151
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:26,237
"O Maria..."

152
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:31,268
"O Maria..."

153
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,031
"O Maria..."

154
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:41,802
Thank you.

155
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,002
Maria's married too!

156
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,842
One by one all the girls
are getting married!

157
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:51,396
You'll get married too some day.

158
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,817
Tomorrow, when Raja goes
fishing I'll tell him.

159
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,813
What?

160
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:04,059
To net a groom for me!

161
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,830
What's wrong with Raja himself?

162
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,214
Raja!

163
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:07,720
My glasses... what's this?

164
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:08,903
That...

165
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,285
Not that, this!
- This!

166
00:16:11,365 --> 00:16:17,803
That's a hankie. With which one
wipes sweat, cleans nose.

167
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:21,421
I've reared you since
you were this small.

168
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:25,642
You try to be smart, with me?
I know everything!

169
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,257
You know everything? What?

170
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:30,414
Why don't you marry her?

171
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:34,109
Marry? Whom?
- Mona of course. Who else?

172
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:40,889
Honestly, Miss Joseph you
misunderstand things.

173
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:47,079
Okay. I thought you would
open your heart to me.

174
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,291
But if you want to hide it,
who am I to probe?

175
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:55,802
No, Mrs. Joseph. Don't say
who are you to question.

176
00:16:56,603 --> 00:17:01,358
If you won't ask me, who will?
Is there anybody else?

177
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,481
Then tell me, when you have
so much fun with her...

178
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:08,680
...why don't you pop the question?

179
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,528
Because this is not a joke.

180
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:17,506
I know, that when I ask her,
she won't refuse.

181
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,738
But let me become capable
of doing so first!

182
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,083
After all, what do I own?

183
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,032
The boat belongs to a contractor.

184
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:31,576
So do the nets I use. Even
the fish I catch, is his!

185
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:36,784
I do make some money, but how will
I keep her happy on this small sum?

186
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:41,568
You mean all your life, you'll...
- No, Mrs. Joseph.

187
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,234
I'll see good days too.
Then I'll go to Mona.

188
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,377
When I own a boat.

189
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:50,658
When I work for myself.

190
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:53,331
When I earn for you, and Mona.

191
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:00,183
Mrs. Joseph... you'll see.

192
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:04,994
One day, your Raja,
in these very waters...

193
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,445
...will ply his very own boat.

194
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:30,629
These small boats really
look fantastic.

195
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,147
I mean they look really good.
How do you feel about it?

196
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:40,759
If you think they're nice, you
better feast your eyes on them.

197
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:46,178
They won't be seen after a few days.
- That's fantastic, sir.

198
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:51,475
They'll not be seen at all.
My eyesight is getting weaker.

199
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:57,811
Even now, though out of focus,
I can see the boats hazily.

200
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,556
You're a born ass! I wasn't
talking about your eyes.

201
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,738
I meant the policy of
Kamladevi's company.

202
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:11,311
We don't want these small fishermen
casting their nets here.

203
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,822
They sell their stuff in the same
market as our company does.

204
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,922
And this affects our
prices very severely.

205
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,264
I feel they'll not listen to you
by you not letting them fish.

206
00:19:24,344 --> 00:19:28,112
They'll have to give in, the way
we're giving to convince them!

207
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:33,024
Get me?
- Of course. It's like, big fish...

208
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,868
...devouring small fish!
Isn't that what you mean?

209
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,614
That's the first time I'm hearing
you talk some sense!

210
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:41,652
Thank you, sir.

211
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:44,406
Captain! Let's turn back.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:19:44,545 --> 00:19:49,676
Madam has called me at 10 sharp.
- 10 o'clock? Then we have to turn back.

213
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:53,053
Because her clock strikes ten,
exactly at ten!

214
00:19:53,937 --> 00:20:00,413
But I do feel one thing, sir.
I'm your humble servant, no doubt.

215
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:03,139
So I'll address her as `Madam'.
But you, sir...

216
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:10,530
You're her late brother's son.
So she's your Aunty.

217
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,053
Why don't you call her that?
- Because, my dear man...

218
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,945
...I want to remain her G.M.!

219
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,823
Kamladevi is `Madam' to one and all.

220
00:20:20,868 --> 00:20:22,189
Including me!

221
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:40,254
Why isn't the work finished yet?
- That land is at a low-level.

222
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:44,589
And now it's flooded due to rains.
That's why I had to halt everything.

223
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:49,433
Don't worry though. I'll try to
finish the work by 26th instant.

224
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:53,917
You don't get paid
just to try your best.

225
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:58,649
If that work is not done by 26th,
you better send your resignation!

226
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:02,235
Good morning, madam.

227
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:07,218
The estimate for the three
Japanese trawlers, is ready.

228
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:08,757
Vikram.
- Yes.

229
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,505
I haven't called you now
to discuss those trawlers.

230
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,073
Ravi's coming!

231
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,017
And as you know...

232
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:21,300
...this property, this
widespread business...

233
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,472
...he has to manage some day.

234
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:27,239
Of course! Why not?

235
00:21:28,944 --> 00:21:31,706
If he stays with you, he'll
learn the ropes by and by.

236
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:35,891
After all, he's your grandson.

237
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:40,136
He has your blood in his veins!

238
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:41,764
True.

239
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,515
But his veins...

240
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:49,662
...also carry blood of an ordinary
girl from an ordinary family!

241
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,860
With whom my son was...

242
00:21:53,802 --> 00:21:54,594
Anyway...

243
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,767
Why recall all these memories
after so many years?

244
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:04,308
I wish, when Ravi comes,
by and by...

245
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,208
put some responsibilities
on his shoulders.

246
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:08,071
Right.

247
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:16,883
Greeting, sir!

248
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,319
Come.

249
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:21,738
Is Gran at home?

250
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:24,982
No. She's busy in the office now.

251
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:37,111
Thank you.
- Sir.

252
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,920
How do you like the bungalow?

253
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,764
It's lovely.

254
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:44,707
And your room?

255
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:46,722
That's lovely too.

256
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,952
It can be developed a lot.

257
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:53,701
We've started fisheries, and
now I've other plans too.

258
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:57,493
Just take interest in work,
and you'll soon know everything.

259
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:03,387
What did you do after college?
Just roamed here and there.

260
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:08,529
You stay here now. I've spoken to
Vikram, to teach you the ropes.

261
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,201
Okay.

262
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,266
And you must get married too.

263
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:15,127
Your father spoilt his life!

264
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,814
But I won't let you do the same.

265
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,971
My father hadn't spoilt his own life.

266
00:23:23,591 --> 00:23:24,887
He led it according to his wish.

267
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:29,132
According to his own wish,
or that woman's wish?

268
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:32,530
Before you go any further, Gran.

269
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:35,586
Remember it's my mother you speak of!

270
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:45,365
If I'm really doing so,...

271
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,880
...then I shouldn't be.

272
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:53,840
Because I don't want to talk
about her at all!

273
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:59,001
You haven't finished
your soup as yet.

274
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,077
Excuse me.

275
00:24:17,146 --> 00:24:20,517
Do you live in this lighthouse?
- Yes.

276
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,220
I've not seen you around before.

277
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,688
Are you a stranger here?

278
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:28,393
Correct.

279
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,449
Must be taking your morning walk.

280
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:32,412
Yes.

281
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:37,946
The sea looks so beautiful
so early in the morning.

282
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:44,421
Why just morning? The sea has a
lovely look each moment of the day.

283
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:49,735
Blue, or aqua or silver.

284
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,544
Sometimes it's bright red too.

285
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,757
And then it roars...

286
00:24:54,837 --> 00:24:57,032
...as though an army's marching in.

287
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,877
And sometimes it's so quiet...

288
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:03,626
...as if a friend's chatting,
his hand on the shoulder.

289
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:07,424
There are countless forms of the sea.

290
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:11,036
If you look carefully, son...

291
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,368
What's your name?
- Ravi.

292
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:16,261
What's your name, Pop?

293
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:19,117
They all call me `Pop' only.

294
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,384
Pop?

295
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:24,608
Okay then, I'll go now. See you.
- Most certainly.

296
00:30:03,377 --> 00:30:07,911
Aren't you going to work today?
- Yes, I'm going.

297
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:13,058
You see her photos before
you go to work.

298
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:17,936
And go straight to see her after
you return. What all this?

299
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:23,963
I don't know. But it's something.
May I go now? I'm late.

300
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,137
Hey look! The company's boats.

301
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:33,235
They aren't company's boats, son.

302
00:30:33,315 --> 00:30:38,184
That's a kick from the rich, which
will hit our stomachs one day!

303
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,760
We're ready, sir. Shall we go back?
- Okay.

304
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:51,633
Why do you always take
such a long detour?

305
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:58,911
I think because the fishermen have their
nets spread over there one has to do it.

306
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,849
Is the sea their private property.

307
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,620
...for them to spread their nets
wherever they please?

308
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,651
Captain Sharma!
- Yes, sir.

309
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:09,006
Today, take this boat straight!

310
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:11,524
But sir, that boat, the net...

311
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:14,109
Do as I say! Take the boat ahead...

312
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,275
Yes, sir.

313
00:31:32,895 --> 00:31:34,517
Hey! He's coming straight at us!

314
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,648
Don't come this way...
There's a net spread here.

315
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,562
Can't you hear me?

316
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:57,847
Go the other way.
- Don't come this way.

317
00:31:58,185 --> 00:31:59,297
Sir, I feel...

318
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,332
Have you gone deaf?

319
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:08,751
There's a net here. Don't come
this way. Go from there.

320
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:13,543
I say stop! We've cast a net here.

321
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,997
Don't come this way.

322
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,373
We poor have suffered huge loss.
Let us go in.

323
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,958
Get lost! I told you before.

324
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:37,839
If we can't come in, we won't
let you come out either!

325
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:44,686
What is it? Why this noise?
- I'll tell you why!

326
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:47,431
Sir, they want to barge in!

327
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:50,099
What do you want?
- Hey, come here.

328
00:32:51,057 --> 00:32:53,963
Your boat destroyed his net.

329
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:57,478
We want money for it.
- Yes! Money!

330
00:32:58,413 --> 00:32:59,592
What money?

331
00:33:00,306 --> 00:33:02,299
Had we told him
to spread his net there?

332
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:05,996
And listen. We'll ply our boat
whichever way we wish.

333
00:33:06,262 --> 00:33:08,487
The sea is not your property.

334
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,271
Okay, we agree we don't own it.

335
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:16,135
Neither does it have your company
stamp on it to do as you please!

336
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:21,165
You have caused him loss.
You'll have to pay him.

337
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:24,519
Look, if you want to start a fight...
- One minute, uncle.

338
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:28,626
What's going on here?

339
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,734
Nothing. They are local fishermen.

340
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:35,439
Their net came in front of our boat.
And now they demanding money.

341
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,412
Our net didn't come in your way.

342
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,026
You deliberately went over it!

343
00:33:43,531 --> 00:33:45,944
If you've done it, why lie?
Tell him.

344
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:50,186
You mean your net is useless now?
- It's wrecked. It belonged to him.

345
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:54,323
He had borrowed money on interest.
Now what will he earn and eat?

346
00:33:55,215 --> 00:33:58,827
Ravi, why do you listen to such lot?
They're just...

347
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:04,792
They may be anything, but
whatever happened, wasn't nice.

348
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:09,237
This man must be compensated today.
Just now!

349
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:11,534
But if Madam.
- Don't worry about her.

350
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:14,674
I'll talk to her. You just pay him.

351
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,393
Okay.

352
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:24,866
Take this man to the office,
and pay his dues.

353
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:26,181
Yes, sir.

354
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:39,202
Have this chilled beer.
It's a fantastic thing.

355
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,219
You will feel cool.

356
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:47,416
I heard that Ravi behaved
like a damn fool today.

357
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:52,038
I don't know about your feelings,
but I felt very bad, sir.

358
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:58,556
After all I'm your sycophant, sir.
So naturally I'll feel bad.

359
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:02,825
But what can we do?
He's Madam's grandson.

360
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:07,717
He's her heir!
- Heir, my foot!

361
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:11,649
Even his father,
Arun was her heir.

362
00:35:12,064 --> 00:35:15,316
Madam's only son.
But what happened?

363
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:21,275
He lived like a beggar all his life!
So what if he's her heir?

364
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:25,306
Exactly! What a fantastic
thing you said.

365
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:30,408
But sir, one thing really hurts me.

366
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,573
When Madam had asked her
own son to get out...

367
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:37,610
...how did this grandson come in?

368
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,174
He was 7 years old.

369
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:43,214
When he lost his parents
in a road accident.

370
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:46,549
Then Madam brought him here.

371
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,760
Lived all his life in a hostel.

372
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,721
Now she has called him here to stay.

373
00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:55,371
What the son couldn't be...

374
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:57,502
...she wants her grandson to be!

375
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,609
Damn fool.

376
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,816
But take my word...

377
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:06,019
...all this estate, this business,
will one day belong to me!

378
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,242
The son didn't get a penny.
Neither will the grandson!

379
00:36:11,657 --> 00:36:17,048
Let's sit in the Giant wheel.
- No! No.

380
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:19,678
What's the matter?
- I get very scared.

381
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,673
Please come on. Let's go.
- No, please.

382
00:36:23,393 --> 00:36:25,766
No! I get so dizzy.

383
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:15,470
Come on, sir. Get down.

384
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:23,920
Come along you folks.
- My name is Ravi.

385
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:29,046
What's yours?
- Come on. I'm famished!

386
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:54,999
Hey! Where are you?

387
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:40,527
"A face as radiant
as the moonlight..."

388
00:38:40,607 --> 00:38:44,496
"your tresses remind me
of dusk..."

389
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:48,449
"your eyes are as deep
as the oceans..."

390
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:52,133
"but could you tell me
what is your name?"

391
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:00,468
"A face as radiant
as the moonlight..."

392
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:04,464
"your tresses remind me
of dusk..."

393
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:08,373
"your eyes are as deep
as the oceans..."

394
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:11,807
"but could you tell me
what is your name?"

395
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:28,487
"How would you know
how my heart pines for you"

396
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:36,007
"How would you know what
dreams I see for you"

397
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:48,345
"Now that you are with me,
I wish this moment would freeze"

398
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:56,679
"As the oceans flow,
I wish they would freeze too"

399
00:39:56,759 --> 00:40:00,602
"You've driven me crazy..."

400
00:40:00,682 --> 00:40:04,527
"how is my poor heart to blame?"

401
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:08,449
"Your eyes are as deep
as the oceans..."

402
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:12,168
"but could you tell me
what is your name?"

403
00:40:20,266 --> 00:40:28,575
"Even if I'm away from you
and we're complete strangers..."

404
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:36,203
"if I don't have you,
I shall be heart-broken"

405
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:29,076
"I wish there was no noise..."

406
00:41:29,156 --> 00:41:32,805
"and we rejoiced the solitude"

407
00:41:33,151 --> 00:41:37,137
"I wish there were no one else
in the world..."

408
00:41:37,217 --> 00:41:40,899
"there were only you and I"

409
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:45,041
"I dream of you..."

410
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:48,951
"I have nothing else to do"

411
00:41:49,031 --> 00:41:52,903
"Your eyes are as deep
as the oceans..."

412
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:56,363
"but could you tell me
what is your name?"

413
00:41:56,942 --> 00:42:00,851
"A face as radiant
as the moonlight..."

414
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:04,873
"your tresses remind me
of dusk..."

415
00:42:04,953 --> 00:42:08,713
"your eyes are as deep
as the oceans..."

416
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:12,423
"but could you tell me
what is your name?"

417
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,259
Mona!

418
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:58,291
Mona!

419
00:43:04,686 --> 00:43:05,373
Mona!

420
00:43:22,553 --> 00:43:23,715
Caught you!

421
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,076
What had you come to steal?

422
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:31,112
See? Honesty has no value here.

423
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:33,287
I was going to my contractor.

424
00:43:35,352 --> 00:43:38,701
Thought I'd ask...
- Spray it.

425
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,075
...if you wanted anything.
- No, nothing.

426
00:43:41,584 --> 00:43:43,881
Nothing.
- Oh Yes! Raja...

427
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:48,292
I had bought this dress material.
I want some buttons for it.

428
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:51,861
Sure.
- Blue. Big ones.

429
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,321
Thank you.

430
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,940
Anything else?

431
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,209
So sweet.

432
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,580
It was a wise move to be
friends with you.

433
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:07,922
It came in handy today.
- Bringing buttons is work?

434
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:11,444
I'm willing even to take life...
I mean stake my life for you.

435
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,204
Really? Is that so?

436
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:17,573
Then come here.

437
00:44:20,168 --> 00:44:23,829
Now jump off the balcony.
- Jump? Off this balcony?

438
00:44:25,786 --> 00:44:26,754
Okay.

439
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,819
Raja!

440
00:44:34,442 --> 00:44:36,178
Come on, Ramsingh. Start.

441
00:44:49,881 --> 00:44:54,214
Don't worry. I'll get your
big, blue buttons!

442
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:57,838
So what you're saying is...

443
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:01,554
...we reduce our prices
in the market, by and by.

444
00:45:02,087 --> 00:45:03,042
Yes.

445
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,802
And what about the loss?

446
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:11,644
We can afford the loss
But the local fishermen...

447
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,766
...it'll break their backbone.

448
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,374
That's because...

449
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:22,615
...every man has borrowed money
on interest for his boat and nets.

450
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:26,524
Or, got them from a contractor,
either on commission, or on hire.

451
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:29,430
If the prices are reduced
like this, then...

452
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:34,294
...the men will never repay their
debts and lose their daily wages.

453
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:39,367
Then we'll have a monopoly
over the market.

454
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,421
Start reducing the prices.

455
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:50,459
Quiet! Quiet! Shut up!
- But these company people...

456
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,763
I know why they've reduced the rates.

457
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:56,285
Just to devastate us!

458
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:59,446
But how will shouting help us?
- Then do we keep quiet?

459
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:01,425
No. I'm not suggesting that.

460
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:06,476
Look... we've to unite and think cool.

461
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,211
What's there to think now?

462
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,847
If you listen to him, you'll
just sit and think.

463
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,746
Oh yes? Then what do you suggest?

464
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:18,562
I suggest there's only one way.

465
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:22,056
Burn the company boats
and burn their godowns!

466
00:46:22,136 --> 00:46:24,657
And then you all go to jail...

467
00:46:24,737 --> 00:46:26,534
...and your kids starve and die!

468
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:28,532
So? They'll starve as it is.

469
00:46:28,612 --> 00:46:31,386
I think what he says is right.
- Yes, he's correct.

470
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:35,347
Correct, my foot...
- Raja, forget it.

471
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:47,722
Okay, if that's how you feel.
Do as he says.

472
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,905
Get lost! You're all `yes' men!
Go and listen to them all.

473
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:24,884
May I've one feni?
- Sorry, but the bar is closed.

474
00:47:24,964 --> 00:47:28,749
Closed? But they're all drinking.

475
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:30,943
True.
- Then?

476
00:47:31,476 --> 00:47:33,531
It's closed just now.

477
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:39,143
Wait, sir.

478
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:43,973
Uncle. Let him have a drink.

479
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:55,778
Make another one like this.

480
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:01,500
How much?
- Rs. 5/-.

481
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:03,333
Thank you.

482
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:11,420
For you.

483
00:48:22,996 --> 00:48:23,944
Hold on, Sir!

484
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:31,945
Uncle, two more.

485
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:38,304
Look sir... you're a big shot.

486
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:43,278
We're simple folk... fishermen.

487
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:46,473
Have a drink with
our hard-earned money too!

488
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:22,105
Now 2 more, on me.

489
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:27,238
Uncle! Two more please.

490
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,452
What's your name, Sir?

491
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:35,293
I'm no `Sir', and my name is...
"Ravi", Raja.

492
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,146
"Ra-ja".

493
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:51,560
He's a Company man,
not a friendly soul.

494
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:56,879
Ravi is my guest.
Get one more bottle.

495
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:01,980
Raja, you don't know it, but
The Company is your foe!

496
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,515
They had enough.
Please give it to me.

497
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:06,861
Uncle.

498
00:50:08,052 --> 00:50:10,058
No more after this.

499
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:12,134
Why?
- You both have taken enough.

500
00:50:13,082 --> 00:50:14,514
Who has taken too much?

501
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,507
Enough.

502
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,645
Well uncle, you think that...

503
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:26,835
Careful.

504
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:28,150
No!

505
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:34,438
Okay.

506
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:41,669
Well, Uncle, you really think
we're drunk?

507
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,780
Get up.
- Go away.

508
00:50:54,147 --> 00:51:02,182
We've finished just 1-2 bottles.
And why not, boys?

509
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:06,192
We're just...
What is it?

510
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,956
Making merry...

511
00:51:10,713 --> 00:51:15,487
We're just `high'... Okay?

512
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:12,146
"Let's keep singing..."

513
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:15,320
"and smiling"

514
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:23,458
"Come, let's sing and dance
and make merry... c'mon"

515
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,805
"Let's keep singing..."

516
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:35,290
"and smiling"

517
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:43,419
"Come, let's sing and dance
and make merry... c'mon"

518
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:42,556
"Let's drink all night"

519
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:46,042
"Let's let our hair down"

520
00:53:47,113 --> 00:53:49,863
"For my sake, my friend..."

521
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,296
"forever be my friend"

522
00:53:54,334 --> 00:53:59,981
"So let's sway and sing now...
c'mon"

523
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:08,111
"Let's keep singing..."

524
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,329
"and smiling"

525
00:54:11,717 --> 00:54:19,104
"Come, let's sing and dance
and make merry... c'mon"

526
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,466
"Love makes the world
so beautiful"

527
00:55:46,158 --> 00:55:49,073
"There's no bigger kick than love"

528
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:52,488
"I'll go wherever my love takes me"

529
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:56,710
"Here it is that you will
find your love, my friend"

530
00:55:57,022 --> 00:56:02,548
"So let's freak out here in
these lanes and sing... c'mon"

531
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,990
"Let's keep singing..."

532
00:56:12,408 --> 00:56:14,440
"and smiling"

533
00:56:14,614 --> 00:56:21,403
"Come, let's sing and dance
and make merry... c'mon"

534
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:52,829
Sir! Sir! Sir!

535
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:58,136
You seem to be very happy.
- I've got a fantastic news.

536
00:56:58,216 --> 00:56:59,996
You always think I'm...

537
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:01,920
...an absolute fool, Sir.

538
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,282
But this time I proved you wrong.
- Really?

539
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:10,111
What news have you brought?

540
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:13,945
Last night, Ravi was seen dancing
and singing with the fishermen, Sir.

541
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:15,587
Singing and dancing.

542
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,882
And also, ... drinking, Sir.

543
00:57:17,962 --> 00:57:19,370
Very good.

544
00:57:39,649 --> 00:57:41,344
This ...
- My mother.

545
00:57:56,993 --> 00:57:57,829
Shall we go?

546
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:03,447
How old were you,
when your mother...

547
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:05,079
12 years old.

548
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:07,321
Lucky.

549
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,328
You've enjoyed your mother
5 more years than me.

550
00:58:12,778 --> 00:58:15,114
I was just 7 when...

551
00:58:16,171 --> 00:58:17,809
both my parents passed away.

552
00:58:20,766 --> 00:58:22,648
My Dad... who was the only
son of a millionairess.

553
00:58:24,148 --> 00:58:26,030
They fell in love and married.

554
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,217
My grandma was so furious...

555
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:33,890
...that she never saw
her son ever again!

556
00:58:38,435 --> 00:58:41,391
Ravi, just remember this.

557
00:58:42,793 --> 00:58:44,752
That how good your parents were.

558
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,923
How much they loved each other.

559
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,797
And forget the bitter things.

560
00:58:50,877 --> 00:58:54,505
I remembered it all because
the history's going to repeat!

561
00:59:01,252 --> 00:59:02,824
You didn't say anything, Mona.

562
00:59:06,498 --> 00:59:07,389
What shall I say?

563
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,370
What your heart wishes.

564
00:59:14,662 --> 00:59:16,677
One doesn't always get
what one's heart wishes.

565
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:21,148
Life has its stark realities too.

566
00:59:22,902 --> 00:59:27,441
Like this reality that we both
come from two different worlds.

567
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:33,352
But our worlds are not so apart
that we cannot bridge the gap.

568
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:39,075
But... You hardly know me! And...

569
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:42,163
Yes. I don't know much about you.

570
00:59:43,857 --> 00:59:47,565
But I want to know.
I want to know everything!

571
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,081
Your every idiosyncrasy...
every bit about you.

572
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:57,231
I wish that we sit together.

573
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,512
And you talk about yourself.

574
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:02,312
While I listen and look at you.

575
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:05,921
And if possible,
let the life thus go by.

576
01:00:08,578 --> 01:00:11,933
No, Ravi. I'm a poor girl.

577
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:15,226
Don't show me such dreams.

578
01:00:16,526 --> 01:00:17,761
It's me who's poor, Mona.

579
01:00:18,901 --> 01:00:21,148
I don't have a dime
of anyone's love.

580
01:00:22,842 --> 01:00:25,388
If you can, give me some,
from your treasure of love.

581
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:29,341
If you refuse, I'll go away.

582
01:00:30,786 --> 01:00:31,982
Exist somehow, somewhere.

583
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:36,172
But I swear, I'll miss you
every moment in my life.

584
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:45,267
"Here, on the seashore..."

585
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:49,396
"my heart calls out to you..."

586
01:01:49,812 --> 01:01:55,745
"I have no one, except you"

587
01:01:57,328 --> 01:01:59,966
"Here, on the seashore..."

588
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,518
"Here, on the seashore..."

589
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:09,721
"my heart calls out to you..."

590
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:16,243
"I have no one, except you"

591
01:02:18,006 --> 01:02:20,920
"Here, on the seashore..."

592
01:02:42,483 --> 01:02:46,020
"The sights have come alive..."

593
01:02:46,306 --> 01:02:49,429
"there's mischief
in the air"

594
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,247
"The sights have come alive..."

595
01:02:57,602 --> 01:03:00,750
"there's mischief
in the air"

596
01:03:01,425 --> 01:03:07,522
"When love awakened...
it awakened everything"

597
01:03:08,846 --> 01:03:15,400
"Not for a moment has my heart
let me go to sleep"

598
01:03:16,404 --> 01:03:19,336
"Here, on the seashore..."

599
01:03:20,045 --> 01:03:22,631
"my heart calls out to you..."

600
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:29,540
"I have no one,
except you"

601
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:34,134
"Here, on the seashore..."

602
01:03:59,366 --> 01:04:05,593
"On the waves sing
fairies of light..."

603
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:16,612
"On the waves sing
fairies of light..."

604
01:04:18,126 --> 01:04:24,328
"I'm as lost as the river
that flows into the sea"

605
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:31,541
"You're not the only one
who feels lost"

606
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:36,046
"Here, on the seashore..."

607
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:39,523
"my heart calls out to you..."

608
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:45,811
"I have no one, except you"

609
01:04:47,766 --> 01:04:50,853
"Here, on the seashore..."

610
01:05:15,228 --> 01:05:16,944
What are you watching so intently?

611
01:05:18,246 --> 01:05:19,104
That boat.

612
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:22,399
You didn't come here yesterday.
Where were you?

613
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:23,938
Yesterday?

614
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:29,811
I feel nice when I come here.

615
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:32,645
The vast open sea. The open sky.

616
01:05:33,786 --> 01:05:35,259
Large-hearted people.

617
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,761
The more I breathe fresh air here...

618
01:05:38,087 --> 01:05:40,368
The more I feel suffocated
in my grandmother's mansion!

619
01:05:42,903 --> 01:05:45,743
Look! See how that boat
is swaying on the waves.

620
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:51,843
As though the waves are heartbeats
and the boat, a desire.

621
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,728
Wow! How beautifully you put it.

622
01:05:56,447 --> 01:05:58,882
Being educated, you can express.

623
01:05:59,507 --> 01:06:00,664
With me...

624
01:06:00,908 --> 01:06:04,257
I can talk nineteen to a dozen,
but I can't express inner feeling.

625
01:06:04,787 --> 01:06:07,201
Why? Are you keeping something
hidden in your heart?

626
01:06:07,281 --> 01:06:08,412
Buddy...

627
01:06:08,878 --> 01:06:10,776
...what kind of a heart is that,
which harbours no feelings?

628
01:06:10,856 --> 01:06:11,574
Really?

629
01:06:12,322 --> 01:06:13,916
But how to express one's feelings.

630
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:15,205
Teach me that.

631
01:06:15,285 --> 01:06:19,041
Okay, I will. And you teach me
how to row that.

632
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:21,050
This thing?

633
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,618
No great shakes.
I'll teach you right now!

634
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:28,798
Like this...
- Like this, eh?

635
01:06:29,463 --> 01:06:30,646
Yes.

636
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:34,856
You're getting the hang of it.

637
01:06:36,471 --> 01:06:40,041
Yes, I'll learn it soon.
- Sure you will.

638
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:43,106
But I think I won't learn
how to open my heart.

639
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:44,601
So what?

640
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:47,443
Tell me what to say, to whom...
and I'll tell it for you.

641
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:53,131
Really? You'll tell?
- Of course I will.

642
01:06:53,211 --> 01:06:55,172
But whom do I tell it to.
Tell me that first.

643
01:06:56,631 --> 01:06:58,382
Shall I tell you?
- Yes.

644
01:07:00,056 --> 01:07:01,336
Well then...

645
01:07:03,507 --> 01:07:04,482
Shall I really?

646
01:07:05,056 --> 01:07:07,796
What nonsense is this? Tell me...

647
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:14,910
What nonsense is this? Tell me...

648
01:07:16,406 --> 01:07:19,278
That's why I told you to sit.
But you...

649
01:07:19,555 --> 01:07:21,743
You said it was easy.

650
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:24,954
Raja!

651
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,073
Hurry! Drink it up.

652
01:07:30,758 --> 01:07:37,487
Did you get hiccups on the way?
- Why?

653
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:43,740
Because we were talking about you.
He's Ravi. My friend.

654
01:07:43,945 --> 01:07:44,858
God bless you.

655
01:07:44,938 --> 01:07:46,886
Thought I'd show him our house.
- What's that?

656
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:49,778
It's just a glass...

657
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:55,127
Did you offer him something to eat or
drink? Or were you just badmouthing me?

658
01:07:55,348 --> 01:07:59,174
No I didn't, but I was going to.
- "Was going to" indeed! Heathen!

659
01:07:59,741 --> 01:08:04,590
Sit down, son. I'll get some tea.
- No, Aunty. Don't bother yourself.

660
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:09,918
I was just leaving. Sit please.
- I know, I know.

661
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:14,140
When you both were alone,
you had a lot to talk about.

662
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:17,751
Now that an old woman is here,
he's wanting to run!

663
01:08:17,952 --> 01:08:20,803
No, Aunty.
It's not like that.

664
01:08:21,743 --> 01:08:23,687
The things he told me about you.

665
01:08:24,296 --> 01:08:26,309
The way you showered love on him.

666
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:28,468
If I could...

667
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:31,734
... I'd have exchanged
places with Raja anytime.

668
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:35,636
No! I'll not give you
my precious Miss Joseph.

669
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:37,725
Let go!

670
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:46,429
God bless you.
- Thank you.

671
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:51,244
Okay then. I'll go now.
- Keep sitting. - It's okay.

672
01:08:55,397 --> 01:09:01,154
I didn't know that the rich
were also good human beings.

673
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:04,738
Why? Weren't they also made
by God?

674
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:07,111
He's a very nice boy.

675
01:09:07,617 --> 01:09:10,467
He has to be nice!
Whose friend after all.

676
01:09:15,815 --> 01:09:20,007
Here's your mutton-patties
and this too.

677
01:09:20,438 --> 01:09:22,652
Don't shout!
I'll just get it for you.

678
01:09:23,405 --> 01:09:25,853
Here's you keema-pav and omelette.

679
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:27,513
Mona, why's it taking ages
for the soda?

680
01:09:27,593 --> 01:09:29,917
Tony, give him a soda.

681
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:32,611
No tea for the past 1/2 hour.
- Please wait.

682
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:37,644
Listen.
- Yes, what do you want?

683
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:39,236
May I have one plate of Time?

684
01:09:41,622 --> 01:09:43,784
Just a plate of Time.

685
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:45,826
I've run out of it!

686
01:09:45,906 --> 01:09:47,816
Mona...
- Yes, Papa.

687
01:09:48,556 --> 01:09:51,075
You'll only get it tomorrow now.
- Hey, listen...

688
01:09:56,431 --> 01:10:00,534
One tea, Mona.
- One cup of friendly look...

689
01:10:02,527 --> 01:10:05,834
And 2 tea-spoons
of sweet nothings.

690
01:10:08,372 --> 01:10:13,312
Sorry. Out of stock.

691
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:20,468
See how habits are formed.
You didn't come yesterday...

692
01:10:20,548 --> 01:10:22,797
...and one day seemed incomplete.

693
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:25,399
Yes, I couldn't make it.

694
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:30,193
We had gone to that village fair.

695
01:10:31,653 --> 01:10:32,837
Mona and I.

696
01:10:33,832 --> 01:10:36,108
This life is also a fun fair, son.

697
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,593
Where people meet...

698
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:44,646
...and where a hand, held
in the crowds, just slips away.

699
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:47,607
This hand will never slip away.

700
01:10:48,237 --> 01:10:49,358
I'll won't let it!

701
01:10:49,438 --> 01:10:52,091
Have you spoken to your Grandma?

702
01:10:52,171 --> 01:10:53,841
Not as yet. But I will.

703
01:10:55,025 --> 01:10:57,010
I'm not worried about her.

704
01:10:57,426 --> 01:10:59,612
But I must speak to Mona's father.

705
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,608
I don't know how I'll...

706
01:11:04,379 --> 01:11:07,022
I think I'll get cold feet.

707
01:11:07,102 --> 01:11:09,098
Then have someone else tell him.

708
01:11:09,327 --> 01:11:10,303
But who?

709
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:14,613
Anyone who knows you and Mr. D'Silva.

710
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:19,381
I just know Raja...

711
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:21,553
That's it! Raja!

712
01:11:21,809 --> 01:11:25,282
Thank you very much. I'll go right now...
- Where?

713
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:28,644
Don't leave anything for tomorrow.
Do it now! I'll go right now...

714
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:31,017
...and tell Raja
to speak to Mr. D'Silva.

715
01:11:31,924 --> 01:11:32,879
Raja!

716
01:11:34,713 --> 01:11:39,168
What's all this you've bought?
- Not all, son.

717
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:43,043
Didn't you say the house needs
to be painted? Hold this.

718
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:46,330
Here you are.
I'll get some more if you need it.

719
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:52,198
This is fine.
But, what's this? Red?

720
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,640
If I use red colour, people will
think I used blood to paint it!

721
01:11:57,808 --> 01:11:59,780
Blood. You know...

722
01:12:07,763 --> 01:12:08,822
Mona!

723
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:10,344
Raja!

724
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:11,935
I've come, Mona.

725
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,672
Papa!

726
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:19,325
What happened?
- Don't know. It's very cold.

727
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:28,114
They were four, and
I was all alone.

728
01:12:28,194 --> 01:12:29,325
What?

729
01:12:29,654 --> 01:12:34,462
But I risked my life for you.

730
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:35,595
For me?

731
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:38,968
Yes, Mona... for you.

732
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:46,293
There were 4 hooligans
behind your house.

733
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:50,280
4 hooligans? What do you mean?

734
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,446
They were planning to kidnap you!

735
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:58,947
I heard them talk. And they saw me!

736
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:02,511
Then what happened?
- Fighting began...

737
01:13:05,062 --> 01:13:09,559
They boxed. I kicked.
They used Judo. I, Karate.

738
01:13:10,138 --> 01:13:15,545
Then those 4 drew knives!

739
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,854
Oh my God! Four knives!

740
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,270
Yes. One knife per head...

741
01:13:25,213 --> 01:13:29,468
Raja, you're not up to
one of your pranks, are you?

742
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:33,752
Raja!

743
01:13:33,832 --> 01:13:36,194
Raja!
- Miss Joseph!

744
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,104
Raja!

745
01:13:38,184 --> 01:13:41,411
I'm dead now!
- No! Don't die.

746
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:45,971
What shall we do about him?
What's happened to him?

747
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:48,822
Look dear, he left this tin
of red colour open in the sun.

748
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:50,994
Red colour?

749
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:56,058
This tin of red colour... that...
- What the hell are you up to?

750
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,292
Why have you put this red colour
on your clothes?

751
01:13:58,372 --> 01:14:01,233
I'll tell you.
But first, I'll show him!

752
01:14:05,163 --> 01:14:06,630
She'll kill me.

753
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:10,506
Ravi! Help! Save me!

754
01:14:10,586 --> 01:14:13,114
Ravi! Help! Save me!

755
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:17,724
I'm being murdered! Help me!

756
01:14:17,804 --> 01:14:18,776
Rascal!

757
01:14:18,856 --> 01:14:21,170
Raja, what happened to you?

758
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:24,180
Where are you running off to? Ravi!

759
01:14:41,249 --> 01:14:45,103
Then I just dropped dead,
with this knife in my back.

760
01:14:45,183 --> 01:14:48,354
Tell me. How do you think
of such pranks?

761
01:14:48,434 --> 01:14:54,582
When Ms Joseph brought the tin,
I just casually remarked...

762
01:14:54,886 --> 01:15:00,261
"Blood"! You should've seen Mona!
Scared to death she was!

763
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:05,588
Naturally! With that knife...
You are the limit, I tell you!

764
01:15:05,754 --> 01:15:09,428
That I am! I've been
telling lies since morning.

765
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:12,715
Then finish your week's quota today.

766
01:15:13,034 --> 01:15:14,466
Say whatever you want to.

767
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,009
Okay.

768
01:15:17,912 --> 01:15:19,082
Shall I say whatever I want to?

769
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:22,756
Yes. Because I've something
important to say too.

770
01:15:22,836 --> 01:15:23,781
Then listen.

771
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:29,440
I love a girl very very much.
And I'm telling you the truth.

772
01:15:31,481 --> 01:15:36,939
But who's that girl.
- She's a very very nice girl.

773
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:42,465
And the day's not far
when we'll get married.

774
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:44,031
Okay, but...

775
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:51,399
But who is she? What's her name?

776
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:54,659
Name? Her name is...

777
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:56,986
Mona!

778
01:15:57,066 --> 01:15:59,114
Mona!

779
01:16:06,924 --> 01:16:08,836
Mona!

780
01:16:13,229 --> 01:16:14,950
Mona!

781
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:22,743
Why alone? I'm here to help.
- What will I do without you?

782
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:28,052
I don't know. But if you come to
the club tonight, we'll have fun.

783
01:16:28,132 --> 01:16:33,052
There's a party there at 10/- each.
Haven't danced for ages.

784
01:16:33,132 --> 01:16:36,632
Let's dance tonight.
- I'm dancing since morning, you...

785
01:16:36,712 --> 01:16:41,120
Hurry up, Mona! I've to go to work.
- Even I had to go some place.

786
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:45,532
But I couldn't. Can't you see I'm
alone. You're lucky to get this!

787
01:16:45,752 --> 01:16:46,547
Hurry up.

788
01:16:46,699 --> 01:16:47,876
Tony.
- Coming.

789
01:16:47,956 --> 01:16:50,221
No 5 and 7 table.
- Here's the money from No.3.

790
01:16:51,253 --> 01:16:55,757
What happened to our drink?
- Hold on. I'll send it across.

791
01:16:56,829 --> 01:16:58,596
Mona. Mona...

792
01:16:58,676 --> 01:17:00,787
What is it?
- Come with me.

793
01:17:01,506 --> 01:17:04,198
How can I? I don't have time
to scratch my head!

794
01:17:04,278 --> 01:17:07,256
I'll scratch it for you.
We've to go in the evening.

795
01:17:07,394 --> 01:17:08,993
Take this.
- I thought...

796
01:17:10,674 --> 01:17:12,424
...I'd call Ravi too.

797
01:17:14,203 --> 01:17:15,766
Hey, Mona... Please come.

798
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,447
Okay. After 7 O'clock.
Papa will return by then too.

799
01:17:19,828 --> 01:17:22,616
That's more like it.
Tonight, at 7 p.m. then.

800
01:17:24,166 --> 01:17:27,570
Listen! Ravi...
- I'll call him.

801
01:18:47,028 --> 01:18:50,744
Ravi... What are you doing here?

802
01:18:52,114 --> 01:18:55,822
There were so many girls there.
Why didn't you dance?

803
01:18:59,095 --> 01:19:03,191
Just like that...
- I'm tired.

804
01:19:03,633 --> 01:19:07,985
This Raja...
He's got wings on his feet! Right?

805
01:19:09,314 --> 01:19:10,019
Yes.

806
01:19:10,524 --> 01:19:12,157
He is so good.

807
01:19:12,829 --> 01:19:17,091
But let me tell you one thing.
No other girl can dance with him.

808
01:19:18,142 --> 01:19:21,477
We were dancing so well.
And you didn't even see.

809
01:19:22,052 --> 01:19:24,308
I saw as much as I could.

810
01:19:25,346 --> 01:19:27,048
Others come in between.

811
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:33,366
Never mind. Where's Raja?
- He went off to drink beer!

812
01:19:34,252 --> 01:19:35,248
Mad!

813
01:19:37,871 --> 01:19:42,202
Mona, why doesn't he get married?

814
01:19:42,721 --> 01:19:43,842
Because...

815
01:19:46,464 --> 01:19:47,467
Never mind.

816
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,972
You don't even have a drink?

817
01:19:50,914 --> 01:19:54,412
Later. But you didn't answer me.

818
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:59,836
Whether he tells me anything
or not, I can sense it.

819
01:20:01,414 --> 01:20:04,132
He thinks, what does he have
at this moment?

820
01:20:04,906 --> 01:20:06,556
Why should he share his poverty
with anyone?

821
01:20:08,216 --> 01:20:09,766
He'll think of marriage...

822
01:20:11,205 --> 01:20:12,450
...when he achieves something.

823
01:20:13,977 --> 01:20:17,890
And you also think he shouldn't
marry before that happens.

824
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:19,983
I don't think so.

825
01:20:20,464 --> 01:20:21,898
But who'll convince him?

826
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:25,496
That if he wants he can easily
have a girl of his choice.

827
01:20:26,116 --> 01:20:29,016
But he's waiting
for such a day...

828
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:33,444
...which I doubt will ever come.
- That shouldn't happen.

829
01:20:33,753 --> 01:20:37,420
Yes. That shouldn't happen at all.

830
01:20:40,175 --> 01:20:42,949
But what can I do?
It's happening.

831
01:20:43,822 --> 01:20:46,887
When it shouldn't be happening.
- What shouldn't be happening?

832
01:20:49,203 --> 01:20:52,178
That there's a party going on inside
and you both are standing here.

833
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:58,079
Now that you came, she left me.
- What else could I do? You...

834
01:20:58,805 --> 01:21:03,628
It's all in the past now.
Come, let's dance.

835
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:04,694
Come on.

836
01:21:06,535 --> 01:21:09,877
Where are you dragging me?
My shoes!

837
01:21:09,957 --> 01:21:10,894
Want some beer?

838
01:21:10,974 --> 01:21:13,557
Ravi, say something.

839
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:18,588
Ravi, please come.

840
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:26,137
Raja is a very hard working
and an honest man.

841
01:21:26,975 --> 01:21:30,835
When he starts working, I'm sure
he'll return your money too.

842
01:21:31,797 --> 01:21:33,831
If not, I'm responsible.

843
01:21:34,004 --> 01:21:36,419
No. I'm not worried about that.

844
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:41,428
I owe a lot to your father.

845
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:47,855
One thing, whenever you meet Raja.

846
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:51,017
He mustn't know I've put in a word...

847
01:21:52,144 --> 01:21:55,112
In fact, he mustn't even know
that you know me.

848
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,855
Resham Singh.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:21:59,118 --> 01:22:01,595
Give this letter to Mr. D'Silva's
daughters in the village.

850
01:22:01,675 --> 01:22:02,529
Okay, sir.

851
01:22:10,511 --> 01:22:11,971
Where were you, son?

852
01:22:13,403 --> 01:22:15,790
She comes and waits for you every day.

853
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:18,510
I'm going away from here.
- Where to?

854
01:22:20,433 --> 01:22:21,616
Very far away.

855
01:22:22,661 --> 01:22:24,349
That's all I know for the moment.

856
01:22:24,429 --> 01:22:26,245
But suddenly, like this?

857
01:22:27,269 --> 01:22:29,061
Have you thought about Mona?

858
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:32,520
Whom will I think of except her?

859
01:22:33,835 --> 01:22:35,509
The more I thought, I realised,...

860
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,201
There's more in her life than me.

861
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:42,670
And you?

862
01:22:42,988 --> 01:22:46,856
I'll manage to live on her memory.

863
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:52,876
Thought I'd meet you
before I leave.

864
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:56,937
Okay then. I...

865
01:23:00,637 --> 01:23:02,235
"...that I'll have to forget you.

866
01:23:03,882 --> 01:23:05,585
I can't forget you of course..."

867
01:23:06,242 --> 01:23:10,642
"But yes. I can go away from you.
So. I'm going."

868
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:15,386
"But wherever I go, I'll always
have your memories with me"

869
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:18,583
"Your flower-life face will
always bloom in my eyes"

870
01:23:19,431 --> 01:23:22,426
"The scent of your hair will always
be found lingering on my shoulder"

871
01:23:23,843 --> 01:23:26,439
"If you can, take my helplessness
as infidelity."

872
01:23:27,225 --> 01:23:28,764
"It may ease things".

873
01:24:14,754 --> 01:24:18,236
"On the seashore..."

874
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:23,880
"all day and night..."

875
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:29,155
"there is a mellow light..."

876
01:24:30,426 --> 01:24:33,989
"and a shade of darkness"

877
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:44,526
"So why this distance between us?
What holds you back?"

878
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:47,735
"How do I convince my heart?"

879
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:54,558
"My love for you is still very deep,
I'm very lonely without you..."

880
01:24:54,638 --> 01:24:57,672
"How do I tell anyone?"

881
01:24:58,588 --> 01:25:02,869
"You are not with me..."

882
01:25:03,613 --> 01:25:07,331
"so what do I ever possess?"

883
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,606
"Just one dream..."

884
01:25:13,748 --> 01:25:17,285
"just one hope"

885
01:25:20,468 --> 01:25:23,643
"Your memories..."

886
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:29,334
"the things you said..."

887
01:25:29,879 --> 01:25:37,481
"I can't spend my days,
I can hardly wait through the nights"

888
01:25:39,072 --> 01:25:46,284
"I'm so crazy about you,
I haven't slept in days"

889
01:25:48,197 --> 01:25:51,103
"Here, on the seashore..."

890
01:25:52,755 --> 01:25:55,937
"my heart calls out to you..."

891
01:25:57,313 --> 01:26:03,829
"I have no one except you"

892
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:46,244
No, Mona. This isn't proper.

893
01:26:47,226 --> 01:26:48,665
What has happened to you?

894
01:26:51,599 --> 01:26:56,199
If you've decided to leave me,
then I can't stop you.

895
01:26:57,681 --> 01:27:00,711
But surely I can ask
what wrong I've done.

896
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:03,666
You're not in the
wrong, Mona. I am.

897
01:27:05,582 --> 01:27:10,149
I didn't know I was snatching you
from somebody else!

898
01:27:11,678 --> 01:27:13,048
Whom are you talking about?

899
01:27:14,702 --> 01:27:16,079
I'm talking about Raja.

900
01:27:16,771 --> 01:27:17,740
Raja!

901
01:27:21,047 --> 01:27:25,572
I didn't know that Raja loved
you and you too loved him.

902
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:29,329
Raja loves me?

903
01:27:31,398 --> 01:27:32,858
And I reciprocate?

904
01:27:34,532 --> 01:27:37,715
How did you come
to that conclusion?

905
01:27:37,902 --> 01:27:41,395
Mona, what I've told you is what
Raja told me himself.

906
01:27:41,475 --> 01:27:42,585
What!
- Yes.

907
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:51,447
If Raja thinks it's like this,
then he shouldn't!

908
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:54,181
I'll tell him.

909
01:27:54,595 --> 01:27:57,716
But why punish me for it?

910
01:27:58,248 --> 01:28:02,088
Ravi! I love you. Only you.

911
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:10,813
Then forget me. Dump me and go.

912
01:28:13,049 --> 01:28:16,824
Even if you don't ever meet me,
I'll still be yours.

913
01:28:19,631 --> 01:28:21,220
I can't belong to anyone else!

914
01:28:24,707 --> 01:28:29,013
Please don't go away... I'll die!

915
01:28:42,302 --> 01:28:46,411
What the hell...
Put me down. Else I'll fall.

916
01:28:47,678 --> 01:28:51,477
I'm feeling dizzy...
- It's me who's feeling dizzy today.

917
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:55,711
I've scored a jackpot!
- Let go of me!

918
01:28:56,438 --> 01:28:58,873
What's the matter? Tell me.
- Then listen.

919
01:28:59,578 --> 01:29:00,637
Sorry.

920
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:05,743
Today, what I wanted,
has happened!

921
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:09,949
I was mending my old nets
and what do I see?

922
01:29:10,406 --> 01:29:15,270
A big car stopped before me
and a man in a suit got down.

923
01:29:15,755 --> 01:29:19,373
Who was that man?
- Obviously a rich man.

924
01:29:19,691 --> 01:29:22,355
R.C. Shukla. R.C...
- Shukla.

925
01:29:22,494 --> 01:29:25,497
He must've heard somewhere,
that I'm the best fisherman here.

926
01:29:26,576 --> 01:29:30,112
I didn't say it, somebody else
must have. And I am the best.

927
01:29:31,053 --> 01:29:34,478
Listen. He wants to invest money.

928
01:29:34,782 --> 01:29:40,885
He's willing to put in such a large
sum that I can buy 4-5 boats!

929
01:29:41,058 --> 01:29:45,645
Buy nets. Do my own work,
start my own company...

930
01:29:45,725 --> 01:29:47,084
Joking again?

931
01:29:47,562 --> 01:29:49,160
No. It's the truth.

932
01:29:50,647 --> 01:29:54,569
Is it really? I can't believe it.

933
01:29:56,029 --> 01:29:59,357
Even I didn't believe it for
some time, that my dream...

934
01:29:59,787 --> 01:30:02,963
...would come true one day.
But it has come true!

935
01:30:04,361 --> 01:30:08,948
He has called me after
4 days in his office.

936
01:30:12,773 --> 01:30:15,423
Do you remember?
- What?

937
01:30:15,672 --> 01:30:16,814
What I had said?

938
01:30:17,499 --> 01:30:23,151
That one day you'll see Raja
in his own boat in these waters!

939
01:30:23,594 --> 01:30:28,776
I remember everything. You had said
something else too. Remember?

940
01:30:30,389 --> 01:30:34,230
Yes. I remember it all.

941
01:30:35,441 --> 01:30:36,617
But for now,...

942
01:30:37,877 --> 01:30:40,727
I'll go to Mona and say...

943
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,044
What will I say?

944
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:48,973
That... The day I was waiting for...

945
01:30:50,053 --> 01:30:51,603
...is here at last, Mona.

946
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:55,941
I can give you a good life.

947
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,210
And I'll also tell her...

948
01:31:00,735 --> 01:31:04,554
Okay. When I say all this...

949
01:31:05,917 --> 01:31:07,536
...what will Mona say?

950
01:31:07,616 --> 01:31:09,398
How do I know, silly!

951
01:31:09,758 --> 01:31:14,421
Why not go and ask her?
- Yes, why not? Stupid!

952
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:18,586
I'll go and meet her now,
and tell her everything.

953
01:31:22,335 --> 01:31:25,047
Hey! Wish me luck at least.

954
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:27,408
God bless you.
- Yes. Thank you.

955
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:29,220
Wipe the powder properly...

956
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,500
What are you doing?

957
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:50,219
Cheena!

958
01:31:51,534 --> 01:31:53,769
Mona! Mona!

959
01:33:25,945 --> 01:33:29,155
Raja, get up! It's very late.

960
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,246
Raja!

961
01:34:11,098 --> 01:34:12,858
I want to say something to you.

962
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:18,668
Yes?

963
01:34:18,848 --> 01:34:19,533
Raja...

964
01:34:23,137 --> 01:34:25,427
I don't know,
what I want to say...

965
01:34:28,022 --> 01:34:31,136
...but keeping quiet will also
not be proper.

966
01:34:33,149 --> 01:34:34,159
Raja...

967
01:34:35,308 --> 01:34:37,861
It's not that I don't like you.

968
01:34:39,252 --> 01:34:40,483
You're very nice.

969
01:34:41,715 --> 01:34:42,864
My bum-chum.

970
01:34:45,105 --> 01:34:49,858
And I always looked upon you
as a very good friend.

971
01:34:50,591 --> 01:34:53,234
Who always laughed,
made others laugh.

972
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,679
I couldn't think of you
as anything else.

973
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:03,231
When you told Ravi...

974
01:35:05,484 --> 01:35:09,919
...whatever you told him.
After that he stopped meeting me.

975
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:13,296
And when he did meet me,...

976
01:35:15,635 --> 01:35:17,614
He told me all this,
after I questioned him.

977
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,773
He doesn't wish to be a
hinderance in your way.

978
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:28,520
And he said, had he known before...

979
01:35:29,776 --> 01:35:32,483
...he'd have never become
so close to me.

980
01:35:35,185 --> 01:35:39,192
Raja, I don't want to hurt you at all.

981
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:44,428
I want you to be happy in every way.

982
01:35:46,482 --> 01:35:47,622
But you only tell me.

983
01:35:48,575 --> 01:35:49,587
What should I do?

984
01:35:51,691 --> 01:35:52,942
Shall I lie to you?

985
01:35:54,935 --> 01:35:57,176
Because...the truth is...

986
01:35:58,051 --> 01:35:59,960
...I love Ravi.

987
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:21,592
Raja!

988
01:36:26,251 --> 01:36:29,980
If you can... please forgive me.

989
01:36:51,043 --> 01:36:54,662
What happened? Why are
you laughing like this?

990
01:36:57,789 --> 01:37:00,203
"If you can... please forgive me."

991
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:16,277
But, what is it?

992
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:19,980
I wasn't going to tell you.

993
01:37:20,777 --> 01:37:24,397
But now that you became emotional,
I'll tell you.

994
01:37:25,326 --> 01:37:28,833
The thing is you are an idiot.

995
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:31,012
A stupid fool.

996
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:36,875
Silly girl. Is there anything
up here, or not? No?

997
01:37:38,536 --> 01:37:39,755
What do you mean?

998
01:37:40,932 --> 01:37:42,316
What I mean is...

999
01:37:42,517 --> 01:37:47,393
...you think if you don't tell me
about Ravi and yourself...

1000
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:49,402
I won't know anything!

1001
01:37:52,148 --> 01:37:53,332
Am I blind?

1002
01:37:55,070 --> 01:37:56,670
I knew everything.

1003
01:37:57,749 --> 01:38:01,579
I said, "Okay, since both
are keeping me in the dark..."

1004
01:38:02,181 --> 01:38:06,006
"...I'll make them tell me.
I'll spin such a yarn..."

1005
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:10,353
Listen. First I cornered Ravi.

1006
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:13,507
And the idiot believed it immediately.

1007
01:38:13,906 --> 01:38:17,708
But I was scared that when
he tells you, you'd guess.

1008
01:38:19,317 --> 01:38:22,004
But you turned out to be
even a bigger fool than him.

1009
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:25,759
See how I took you both for a ride?

1010
01:38:26,535 --> 01:38:29,817
You mean this was all a joke?

1011
01:38:30,737 --> 01:38:34,340
Then what else? You only said...

1012
01:38:34,472 --> 01:38:38,219
...I was your bum-chum, who
laughs; makes others laugh.

1013
01:38:38,589 --> 01:38:42,270
It was just a small prank,
and you started weeping...

1014
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:43,864
Does anyone play such a prank?

1015
01:38:44,363 --> 01:38:46,931
Then how does one play it?

1016
01:38:52,326 --> 01:38:55,475
I won't leave you today!
- Not this... not this...

1017
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:56,649
I won't spare you.

1018
01:39:05,754 --> 01:39:07,010
I won't spare you today.

1019
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:11,958
You coward! Just you wait...
- I explained and you throw shoes...

1020
01:39:12,506 --> 01:39:15,611
Shoes? I'll break your head!
- No...

1021
01:39:18,209 --> 01:39:20,175
I won't let you get away.

1022
01:39:20,255 --> 01:39:23,363
What should I do?
Help! This girl is crazy...

1023
01:39:25,256 --> 01:39:31,487
You fraud, rascal...
Let go of me! Let go!

1024
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,853
Either get angry, or laugh.

1025
01:39:39,561 --> 01:39:40,654
Silly girl!

1026
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:43,741
You're very bad!

1027
01:39:44,773 --> 01:39:46,993
That I am. But can't help it.

1028
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:54,014
But there's one thing.
Here, hold my hand.

1029
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:05,440
Just because I told you everything
don't go and tell it to Ravi.

1030
01:40:06,027 --> 01:40:07,893
We'll needle him a bit more.

1031
01:40:09,105 --> 01:40:10,550
He's bugged as it is!

1032
01:40:11,103 --> 01:40:12,326
Only for 5 minutes.

1033
01:40:13,565 --> 01:40:14,346
No...

1034
01:40:15,187 --> 01:40:16,128
Two minutes? Okay?

1035
01:40:17,574 --> 01:40:18,371
Yes.

1036
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:22,256
But, don't stretch it too far, okay?

1037
01:40:33,868 --> 01:40:36,534
I don't understand, Raja.

1038
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:39,388
Mona, you said...
- I'll explain.

1039
01:40:41,884 --> 01:40:48,575
It's better you forget Mona.

1040
01:40:52,705 --> 01:40:55,943
She'll never be happy with you.

1041
01:40:56,773 --> 01:40:57,990
It's different with me.

1042
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,530
We're from the same place.

1043
01:41:00,813 --> 01:41:03,297
Our way of life is
also similar, and...

1044
01:41:03,809 --> 01:41:06,853
You better explain it to him.

1045
01:41:11,433 --> 01:41:14,128
What Raja says is true.

1046
01:41:15,552 --> 01:41:18,690
I've also come to this
decision, that I...

1047
01:41:24,948 --> 01:41:29,094
Mona... - Oh Lord! Can't you
control yourself a bit?

1048
01:41:29,464 --> 01:41:33,776
Bungled it, didn't you?
- I couldn't stop myself...

1049
01:41:38,028 --> 01:41:40,950
See his face? That's what
you also looked like!

1050
01:41:41,437 --> 01:41:46,645
Why are you laughing?
- This was all his idea.

1051
01:41:47,751 --> 01:41:49,987
It was this prankster's joke.

1052
01:41:51,459 --> 01:41:55,805
But it wasn't a joke that day.
He wasn't joking. Ask him!

1053
01:41:58,141 --> 01:41:59,248
He is also laughing.

1054
01:42:00,410 --> 01:42:03,688
Listen to me, Mona.
- You don't know him.

1055
01:42:03,915 --> 01:42:06,156
See how seriously he
was talking just now?

1056
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:11,006
Had I not burst out
laughing, this man...

1057
01:42:11,086 --> 01:42:14,361
No... I was going to
tell him today.

1058
01:42:16,358 --> 01:42:18,611
Look Ravi, this is all a joke!

1059
01:42:19,292 --> 01:42:20,127
Silly...

1060
01:42:21,335 --> 01:42:24,268
Remember? We had come to this
very place that day.

1061
01:42:24,578 --> 01:42:26,122
Yes.
- And what had I said?

1062
01:42:26,438 --> 01:42:29,017
I'm going to lie all day.
And you said...

1063
01:42:29,432 --> 01:42:34,165
"Finish your quota for the week.
Do what you like". Am I right?

1064
01:42:34,801 --> 01:42:36,047
Yes.

1065
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:39,417
And I said all this after that.
And you didn't get it?

1066
01:42:42,257 --> 01:42:45,639
Yes... yes you did.
- Now he's saying "Yes"...

1067
01:42:54,908 --> 01:43:00,066
You're dangerous! You nearly...
- Put you through an acid test?

1068
01:43:00,146 --> 01:43:00,841
Yes.

1069
01:43:02,053 --> 01:43:05,695
If you hide something from a pal,
you'll be punished!

1070
01:43:05,775 --> 01:43:08,518
I wanted to tell you that day.
- Why didn't you?

1071
01:43:08,598 --> 01:43:10,665
With you...

1072
01:43:16,392 --> 01:43:19,033
We laughed so much today! Right?

1073
01:43:19,941 --> 01:43:22,116
Yes, and while laughing,
tears filled our eyes.

1074
01:43:24,506 --> 01:43:27,766
Forget it. May I say something?

1075
01:43:29,886 --> 01:43:31,254
I bless you with all my heart.

1076
01:43:33,273 --> 01:43:34,624
Be happy, always.

1077
01:43:38,127 --> 01:43:39,162
I know it for sure.

1078
01:43:40,203 --> 01:43:42,124
She loves you very much.

1079
01:43:45,487 --> 01:43:50,882
Promise, you'll never ever
leave her.

1080
01:43:53,794 --> 01:43:56,389
Raja... I promise.

1081
01:43:58,285 --> 01:44:02,007
I promise Mona, and you too.

1082
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:07,121
See this ring.

1083
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:10,372
It's my mother's.

1084
01:44:12,433 --> 01:44:16,861
And you're a witness. I want to
put it on her in your presence.

1085
01:44:23,414 --> 01:44:26,724
This ring is an assurance
of my love...

1086
01:44:27,638 --> 01:44:29,171
...and a lifelong promise too.

1087
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,777
We'll always remember today. Right?
- It'll be remembered alright.

1088
01:44:42,857 --> 01:44:44,676
Let's have a celebration then.

1089
01:44:46,514 --> 01:44:49,215
Tell him. He made our life hell.

1090
01:44:49,896 --> 01:44:53,090
His punishment is, that
he'll throw a party for us.

1091
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:56,722
That's no punishment.

1092
01:44:58,564 --> 01:45:00,081
Right
you sit, and I'll go now.

1093
01:45:00,613 --> 01:45:01,293
Where to?

1094
01:45:01,373 --> 01:45:04,559
There's a party.
Must make arrangements.

1095
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:07,388
Tonight, at my place, okay?

1096
01:45:11,595 --> 01:45:12,331
Ravi...

1097
01:45:13,964 --> 01:45:16,527
His one prank may have
made us very unhappy...

1098
01:45:17,989 --> 01:45:19,583
But he's such a wonderful friend.

1099
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:21,957
Isn't he?

1100
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:49,464
"It's true, my love,
true love is something..."

1101
01:46:49,544 --> 01:46:54,871
"that is requitted
by the woman you love"

1102
01:46:54,951 --> 01:47:02,698
"Everything else is meaningless,
my dear friend"

1103
01:47:03,173 --> 01:47:08,145
"It's true, my love,
true love is something..."

1104
01:47:08,819 --> 01:47:14,052
"that is requitted
by the woman you love"

1105
01:47:14,132 --> 01:47:21,491
"Everything else is meaningless,
my dear friend"

1106
01:48:00,782 --> 01:48:05,963
"When you see someone
holding her hand..."

1107
01:48:06,282 --> 01:48:10,650
"you know that's the lucky guy"

1108
01:48:11,713 --> 01:48:15,908
"What distances,
what goals...?"

1109
01:48:17,145 --> 01:48:21,668
"they mean nothing when
your companion is with you"

1110
01:48:22,774 --> 01:48:27,436
"When she makes Lady Luck
smile upon you..."

1111
01:48:28,017 --> 01:48:35,446
"she's the woman for you,
my dear friend"

1112
01:49:00,835 --> 01:49:05,411
"I was always told
that life..."

1113
01:49:06,196 --> 01:49:10,219
"was about joys and sorrows"

1114
01:49:11,672 --> 01:49:15,712
"What I have seen, however..."

1115
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:20,823
"that life is a game..."

1116
01:49:22,668 --> 01:49:27,294
"in which one wins and the
other loses all he has"

1117
01:49:28,003 --> 01:49:35,415
"As for me, I stand to lose,
my dear friend..."

1118
01:49:36,334 --> 01:49:41,419
"It's true, my love,
true love is something..."

1119
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:46,781
"that is requitted
by the woman you love"

1120
01:49:47,144 --> 01:49:55,041
"Everything else is meaningless,
my dear friend"

1121
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:34,803
We had fun at Raja's
house last night.

1122
01:50:37,488 --> 01:50:43,057
I hear he and Miss Joseph
have left for Goa.

1123
01:50:44,421 --> 01:50:47,057
Miss Joseph's sister lives there.
- Yes.

1124
01:50:52,259 --> 01:50:57,496
This chap Ravi... don't know much
about him, but he seems nice.

1125
01:50:58,852 --> 01:51:01,606
Papa. Why don't you ask
what you want to know?

1126
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:04,000
Me? I don't want to ask anything.

1127
01:51:05,994 --> 01:51:10,028
Okay, don't ask anything,
but I'll answer you anyway.

1128
01:51:11,474 --> 01:51:12,173
Yes!

1129
01:51:13,674 --> 01:51:18,344
Ravi and I love each other.

1130
01:51:19,876 --> 01:51:21,329
We want to get married.

1131
01:51:23,066 --> 01:51:26,137
And he wants to talk to you
about this personally.

1132
01:51:28,169 --> 01:51:28,988
My dear!

1133
01:51:31,766 --> 01:51:33,421
You're being so childish.

1134
01:51:35,342 --> 01:51:39,271
Have you ever thought, who
he is and what we are?

1135
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:43,013
They're very different from us.

1136
01:51:44,026 --> 01:51:46,793
We are poor people.

1137
01:51:48,277 --> 01:51:49,378
The lower class.

1138
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,117
No, Papa.

1139
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,139
Being rich and poor doesn't decide
whether a man is high class or not.

1140
01:52:00,038 --> 01:52:03,304
Neither Ravi believes in it,
and nor do I.

1141
01:52:05,203 --> 01:52:09,210
Tell me the truth.
Don't you approve of Ravi?

1142
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:11,800
Nothing like that, my dear.
I just...

1143
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:16,638
Your choice, is my choice.

1144
01:52:17,319 --> 01:52:18,210
Papa!

1145
01:52:20,695 --> 01:52:23,402
My dear... I just want...

1146
01:52:24,183 --> 01:52:25,893
...you to be happy.

1147
01:52:28,085 --> 01:52:29,839
Does his Grandmother know you?

1148
01:52:33,957 --> 01:52:35,767
Ravi's taking me to meet her today.

1149
01:52:37,334 --> 01:52:40,802
And listen...
You're looking beautiful.

1150
01:52:40,882 --> 01:52:42,642
Listen to me, Ravi.

1151
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:44,237
Greetings, sir.
- Resham Singh.

1152
01:52:44,317 --> 01:52:46,788
Where's my Grandma?
- She has gone to Palnagar.

1153
01:52:46,868 --> 01:52:49,350
When?
- Just now at 4 o'clock.

1154
01:52:49,782 --> 01:52:52,062
Said she'll return tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

1155
01:52:55,499 --> 01:52:56,252
Okay.

1156
01:52:57,447 --> 01:53:00,048
If it's okay, then...
shall we go back?

1157
01:53:00,609 --> 01:53:02,832
Okay. What's your hurry anyway?
We'll go back.

1158
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,048
Listen Resham Singh...
It's a day off for you servants.

1159
01:53:10,969 --> 01:53:13,039
It was Resham Singh calling.

1160
01:53:14,406 --> 01:53:16,288
You didn't believe me did you?

1161
01:53:16,941 --> 01:53:18,928
Well, go and see for yourself.

1162
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:23,406
You're here, 50 miles away,
in Palnagar.

1163
01:53:24,325 --> 01:53:26,966
And there, Ravi has sent the
servants home.

1164
01:53:27,901 --> 01:53:28,881
And right now...

1165
01:53:29,201 --> 01:53:32,749
Ravi and that girl are all
alone in the bungalow!

1166
01:53:34,715 --> 01:53:38,783
My car! I'll go home, now!
- Yes, Ma'am.

1167
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:42,799
Mona!

1168
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:45,872
Mona!

1169
01:53:46,246 --> 01:53:47,193
Mona!

1170
01:53:47,919 --> 01:53:49,269
Listen to me.

1171
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:53,336
I am not doing anything.
- Ravi, leave me.

1172
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:54,837
Ravi, what are you doing?

1173
01:53:55,218 --> 01:53:56,305
Ravi!

1174
01:54:35,754 --> 01:54:39,442
"Let me go, please"

1175
01:54:40,044 --> 01:54:43,482
"Come closer, please"

1176
01:54:44,202 --> 01:54:47,516
"Let me go, please"

1177
01:54:48,388 --> 01:54:51,944
"Come closer, please"

1178
01:54:52,513 --> 01:54:56,089
"Don't touch me..."

1179
01:54:56,169 --> 01:54:59,543
"don't touch me, please"

1180
01:55:00,612 --> 01:55:03,556
"Let me come closer"

1181
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:08,366
"Let me go, please"

1182
01:55:08,913 --> 01:55:12,670
"Come to me, come to me..."

1183
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:16,275
"come to me, please"

1184
01:55:17,083 --> 01:55:20,985
"Let me go, please"

1185
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:24,991
"Let me come closer, please"

1186
01:55:46,571 --> 01:55:50,016
"The story of my thirsty lips..."

1187
01:55:54,748 --> 01:55:58,380
"The story of my thirsty lips..."

1188
01:55:58,885 --> 01:56:02,199
"I've got to get closer
to tell you"

1189
01:56:07,084 --> 01:56:10,702
"They're things beyond
my comprehension..."

1190
01:56:11,207 --> 01:56:14,957
"don't get closer,
I may fall"

1191
01:56:15,037 --> 01:56:18,306
"Come to me, come to me..."

1192
01:56:18,652 --> 01:56:22,638
"come to me, please"

1193
01:56:23,384 --> 01:56:26,920
"Let me go, please"

1194
01:56:27,487 --> 01:56:30,801
"Come closer, please"

1195
01:56:48,564 --> 01:56:52,155
"I toss and turn all night..."

1196
01:56:56,522 --> 01:57:00,044
"I toss and turn all night..."

1197
01:57:00,589 --> 01:57:04,311
"my body's on fire"

1198
01:57:09,202 --> 01:57:12,600
"Desires that are awakened
in your heart..."

1199
01:57:13,305 --> 01:57:16,315
"mustn't be allowed to
burn out"

1200
01:57:17,104 --> 01:57:20,584
"Don't touch me, don't touch me..."

1201
01:57:20,664 --> 01:57:24,645
"don't touch me, please"

1202
01:57:25,415 --> 01:57:28,729
"Come to me, please"

1203
01:57:29,254 --> 01:57:33,530
"Let me go, please"

1204
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:37,128
"Come to me, come to me..."

1205
01:57:37,208 --> 01:57:40,670
"come to me, please"

1206
01:57:41,902 --> 01:57:45,715
"Let me go, please"

1207
01:57:45,964 --> 01:57:49,500
"Come to me, please"

1208
01:58:16,119 --> 01:58:19,108
Grandma... she's Mona.

1209
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:24,112
I had brought her to meet you,
but you weren't here. So...

1210
01:58:28,845 --> 01:58:32,416
Where do you live?
- I...

1211
01:58:32,496 --> 01:58:35,674
Here... in the village.

1212
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,693
It's late. Go and leave her home.

1213
01:58:42,254 --> 01:58:45,824
It's late no doubt, but I...

1214
01:58:47,705 --> 01:58:50,341
Okay. Some other day I'll...

1215
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,344
Some other day.
- Shall we go?

1216
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:11,823
May I bring Mona to meet you
whenever you say so?

1217
01:59:11,903 --> 01:59:15,587
No need. I've seen her.

1218
01:59:16,991 --> 01:59:22,442
Heard about her from you, so,
it's not necessary to meet her.

1219
01:59:22,522 --> 01:59:26,975
But, just once...
- Tell her father...

1220
01:59:27,284 --> 01:59:30,702
...to come and meet me.
Isn't that what you wanted?

1221
01:59:31,436 --> 01:59:35,283
Okay. Send him to me.
Tomorrow morning.

1222
01:59:35,489 --> 01:59:36,292
Right.

1223
01:59:36,963 --> 01:59:38,195
At 10:30 sharp!

1224
01:59:42,865 --> 01:59:44,609
Do you think I should go there?

1225
01:59:49,078 --> 01:59:51,375
Something tells me
they are not like us.

1226
01:59:51,527 --> 01:59:52,703
Papa!

1227
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:57,084
There you go again!
Why should we care about them?

1228
01:59:57,582 --> 02:00:01,664
Ravi's like us, isn't he?
That's fine. Now get up.

1229
02:00:02,086 --> 02:00:03,767
You've to reach there at 10:30.

1230
02:00:03,975 --> 02:00:05,926
Okay. Okay.

1231
02:00:12,027 --> 02:00:13,349
Good morning.

1232
02:00:18,774 --> 02:00:22,157
I'm...
- You! You're that girl's father.

1233
02:00:22,385 --> 02:00:27,460
What do you think?
Will they be talking now?

1234
02:00:29,972 --> 02:00:33,888
What does that mean? They are
either discussing or not discussing.

1235
02:00:34,337 --> 02:00:35,624
They must be discussing.

1236
02:00:36,337 --> 02:00:38,544
Throw him out of the house!

1237
02:00:38,624 --> 02:00:43,560
Let me go! And you...
Show the money-power to others!

1238
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:47,636
My daughter will spit on your
money! You talk about her?

1239
02:00:47,716 --> 02:00:52,971
So what if we're poor? We're
much better than you at least.

1240
02:01:00,998 --> 02:01:03,454
Okay then. May I go now?

1241
02:01:03,904 --> 02:01:06,720
Wait, Ravi. Papa may have returned.

1242
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:10,803
Make way... make way.
Get a cot, somebody.

1243
02:01:10,883 --> 02:01:11,931
Papa!

1244
02:01:13,252 --> 02:01:14,345
Papa!

1245
02:01:15,209 --> 02:01:16,814
Papa!

1246
02:01:17,298 --> 02:01:20,086
What happened to him?

1247
02:01:21,214 --> 02:01:25,282
Open your eyes, Papa.
Why doesn't he speak?

1248
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:27,995
What's wrong with Papa?

1249
02:01:28,624 --> 02:01:30,361
Papa!

1250
02:01:30,441 --> 02:01:34,781
What happened to D'Silva?
- Kamladevi's men beat him up!

1251
02:01:34,861 --> 02:01:35,833
Really?

1252
02:01:36,616 --> 02:01:40,414
Grandma! Who the hell
do you think you are?

1253
02:01:41,639 --> 02:01:45,666
Who are you anyway? Don't
you have any decency?

1254
02:01:46,164 --> 02:01:48,426
You had called him over yourself.

1255
02:01:49,748 --> 02:01:54,321
I never thought you were calling
that gentleman over, to insult him!

1256
02:01:56,093 --> 02:01:57,809
Don't be stupid.

1257
02:01:59,303 --> 02:02:01,109
Only they feel insulted...

1258
02:02:01,883 --> 02:02:03,475
...who have any respect!

1259
02:02:03,555 --> 02:02:05,550
In your eyes, only you have it!

1260
02:02:05,743 --> 02:02:07,383
Because you have money!

1261
02:02:08,587 --> 02:02:10,400
But you better understand one thing.

1262
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:14,454
He hadn't come begging to you.
You had no right to treat him so...

1263
02:02:16,137 --> 02:02:19,576
"Insultingly" is a very mild world.
- And this mild word...

1264
02:02:19,656 --> 02:02:22,772
...is so appropriate for
a lowly man like D'Silva!

1265
02:02:23,706 --> 02:02:25,664
He doesn't know how to tack!

1266
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:28,286
I just said something to him...

1267
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,466
...and he lost his control.

1268
02:02:30,693 --> 02:02:33,217
You must've insulted him cheaply.

1269
02:02:33,297 --> 02:02:36,793
One has to talk in that manner,
when one speaks the truth about them.

1270
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:42,803
Such people have no control over
their tongue. He began to shout.

1271
02:02:43,085 --> 02:02:46,855
So my servants came and...
- How dare the servants manhandle...

1272
02:02:46,935 --> 02:02:49,008
My servants are loyal to me!

1273
02:02:50,027 --> 02:02:53,984
And they can't bear any one
speaking in a raised voice to me!

1274
02:02:57,283 --> 02:03:01,511
You'll have to apologise
to Mr. D'Silva and Mona.

1275
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:03,736
You're not on your senses
at this moment.

1276
02:03:04,356 --> 02:03:06,958
Because only a mad person
would talk to me like this.

1277
02:03:08,082 --> 02:03:10,113
I've not heard such a thing
from anyone else before.

1278
02:03:11,198 --> 02:03:15,516
Then I'll say something which you
have heard before from your son.

1279
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:18,422
I'm leaving your house!

1280
02:03:19,159 --> 02:03:21,981
I advise you to drop this idea.

1281
02:03:23,929 --> 02:03:26,636
Because when your father
had left this house...

1282
02:03:27,112 --> 02:03:28,778
...I had totally forgotten him.

1283
02:03:29,907 --> 02:03:32,331
But maybe I made a mistake.

1284
02:03:33,006 --> 02:03:35,862
Had I tried later on,
I may have saved him.

1285
02:03:36,487 --> 02:03:39,111
If you go, I'll keep you in mind.

1286
02:03:39,726 --> 02:03:42,416
I know that girl's not worthy of you.

1287
02:03:43,286 --> 02:03:48,600
Live wherever you want to. I won't
let that girl mar your life.

1288
02:03:52,521 --> 02:03:56,777
Grandma, this world has seen
many people like you before too.

1289
02:03:57,436 --> 02:03:59,766
Who tried to become God!

1290
02:04:00,275 --> 02:04:02,827
But neither they, nor you are God!

1291
02:04:03,546 --> 02:04:06,801
You are God in your company,
and in the 4 walls of this house.

1292
02:04:07,395 --> 02:04:09,738
And today I'm going out
of these 4 walls.

1293
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:40,148
Where do you think you're going?

1294
02:04:40,439 --> 02:04:42,681
I'm going in to see D'Silva.

1295
02:04:42,809 --> 02:04:49,141
Aren't you satisfied even now?
We know who beat him and why.

1296
02:04:49,296 --> 02:04:52,972
Try to understand me. I came here...
- Get going!

1297
02:04:53,621 --> 02:04:56,671
If I see you anywhere near here
I'll kill you!

1298
02:04:56,751 --> 02:05:00,850
Why you do you think the girls from
our village have no self-respect?

1299
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:07,185
You call people home and hit them?
- I've nothing to do with that.

1300
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:10,181
Ravi!

1301
02:05:10,261 --> 02:05:11,821
Where are you going?
You shameless girl?

1302
02:05:12,215 --> 02:05:13,163
Mona!

1303
02:05:13,642 --> 02:05:14,646
Ravi!

1304
02:05:14,826 --> 02:05:19,120
Stop? Let go of me!

1305
02:05:21,041 --> 02:05:21,923
Ravi!

1306
02:05:22,003 --> 02:05:26,299
Stop! Look don't hit him. Please.

1307
02:05:26,723 --> 02:05:29,819
He's not at fault at all.
- Get up!

1308
02:05:29,899 --> 02:05:34,410
Your father's lying unconscious,
and you're out to humiliate us?

1309
02:05:34,490 --> 02:05:36,133
Get inside!
- Why don't you understand?

1310
02:05:36,213 --> 02:05:37,364
Ravi!

1311
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:39,806
Mona!

1312
02:05:40,726 --> 02:05:41,583
Get inside!
- Leave me.

1313
02:05:41,663 --> 02:05:42,932
Mona!
- Ravi!

1314
02:05:46,067 --> 02:05:47,126
Mona

1315
02:05:48,807 --> 02:05:49,852
No!

1316
02:05:50,723 --> 02:05:52,889
No! No! No!

1317
02:05:54,149 --> 02:05:55,131
No!

1318
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,115
Take the rascal away!

1319
02:06:07,191 --> 02:06:09,100
Let me meet Mona. Please.

1320
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:11,840
Upstairs, girl.
- Maria!

1321
02:06:13,355 --> 02:06:14,580
Tell them to let Ravi go.

1322
02:06:14,912 --> 02:06:16,109
Look, listen to me.

1323
02:06:18,690 --> 02:06:19,735
Mona!

1324
02:06:19,949 --> 02:06:24,445
Why don't you all listen?
- We'll see to her. Let her go.

1325
02:06:24,525 --> 02:06:25,941
Maria, please.

1326
02:06:26,315 --> 02:06:27,394
Mona!

1327
02:06:28,868 --> 02:06:29,809
Mona!

1328
02:06:30,583 --> 02:06:33,918
Ravi!
- Let go of me! Let go, I say.

1329
02:06:33,998 --> 02:06:34,769
Mona!

1330
02:06:35,559 --> 02:06:39,503
I've left that house for good.
Why don't you all understand?

1331
02:06:39,710 --> 02:06:43,059
I've nothing to do with all this.
I had come to apologise to D'Silva.

1332
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:45,363
No!

1333
02:06:45,957 --> 02:06:49,839
Throw him outside the town.
- No, please don't be so cruel.

1334
02:06:50,663 --> 02:06:56,709
I beg you!
Leave him alone. Let him go.

1335
02:06:58,425 --> 02:06:59,331
Ravi!

1336
02:07:01,496 --> 02:07:03,530
This work must be done
within 2 days!

1337
02:07:05,244 --> 02:07:09,401
All the loan papers
of all the village fishermen...

1338
02:07:09,866 --> 02:07:13,486
...whatever is with the village
moneylenders and contractors, buy it.

1339
02:07:13,566 --> 02:07:17,721
But, those people may not
be willing to sell, Madam.

1340
02:07:17,801 --> 02:07:19,765
We'll give them 4 times the amount.

1341
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:22,338
Who can refuse such an offer?

1342
02:07:23,479 --> 02:07:26,988
How many more to go?
Give them the Court Order...

1343
02:07:27,531 --> 02:07:28,970
And finish this matter.

1344
02:07:29,363 --> 02:07:31,749
Mancha Ram! Who's he?

1345
02:07:33,979 --> 02:07:36,436
What's all this, Bosco?

1346
02:07:36,862 --> 02:07:38,639
Why is the police here?

1347
02:07:38,783 --> 02:07:44,351
It's all over. There's not a single
man here, who has a boat now.

1348
02:07:44,854 --> 02:07:48,447
We've all got Court Orders.
- Court orders, my foot!

1349
02:07:48,735 --> 02:07:52,128
I won't give them my boat!
- Your name's been called too.

1350
02:07:52,208 --> 02:07:56,650
What! Sir! Won't part with my boat.

1351
02:07:57,232 --> 02:08:00,863
Sir, if we give our boats,
how will we earn our living?

1352
02:08:00,996 --> 02:08:04,760
Why don't you also tell him?
- Just give me the papers.

1353
02:08:05,531 --> 02:08:07,922
What's your name.
- Surkiya.

1354
02:08:08,354 --> 02:08:10,496
Is this your signature?
- Yes.

1355
02:08:11,044 --> 02:08:14,769
You owe money to a money-lender.

1356
02:08:15,638 --> 02:08:19,347
You haven't paid him interest either.
And it clearly says here...

1357
02:08:19,545 --> 02:08:21,582
...that he can confiscate
your boat any time he likes.

1358
02:08:22,928 --> 02:08:25,629
But that's between him and me.

1359
02:08:26,038 --> 02:08:27,228
Who are you people?

1360
02:08:27,583 --> 02:08:31,485
That man has sold these papers,
that is your boat, which you claim...

1361
02:08:31,844 --> 02:08:36,017
...your own, to Kamladevi.
- How can he do that?

1362
02:08:37,102 --> 02:08:39,953
Let's see how anyone
takes away my boat!

1363
02:08:40,033 --> 02:08:43,312
Do things within the law.
Else you'll be jailed!

1364
02:08:43,578 --> 02:08:47,364
Make him understand. Next!

1365
02:08:48,111 --> 02:08:51,372
I told you.
I can't do anything.

1366
02:08:51,576 --> 02:08:57,299
But if you take away a boat
from a fisherman, he'll be ruined.

1367
02:08:57,379 --> 02:09:00,438
Look, only Madam can help you
in this matter.

1368
02:09:00,892 --> 02:09:03,471
Then shall we meet Madam?
- No!

1369
02:09:04,965 --> 02:09:05,917
But yes...

1370
02:09:07,047 --> 02:09:11,071
If D'Silva's daughter meets Madam,
Then Madam may agree.

1371
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:13,590
What's happened?

1372
02:09:15,554 --> 02:09:17,480
All of you here. Like this.

1373
02:09:21,050 --> 02:09:21,808
Mona!

1374
02:09:22,034 --> 02:09:25,184
No! I didn't call you.

1375
02:09:27,244 --> 02:09:29,142
The villagers have sent you!

1376
02:09:29,889 --> 02:09:32,042
But why would you do that?

1377
02:09:33,109 --> 02:09:34,759
What do you have against them?

1378
02:09:36,037 --> 02:09:38,616
You live in this village!
- I ...

1379
02:09:41,661 --> 02:09:44,749
Look, Madam, I love Ravi.

1380
02:09:46,066 --> 02:09:49,326
And if this is a crime,
then let me be punished.

1381
02:09:50,337 --> 02:09:51,280
Why should others suffer?

1382
02:09:52,431 --> 02:09:53,614
They are not at fault.

1383
02:09:54,367 --> 02:09:55,292
I see!

1384
02:09:56,182 --> 02:09:58,489
So you do sympathise with them.

1385
02:10:00,536 --> 02:10:04,923
If you wish, that
I let them live...

1386
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:09,567
...then you'll have to promise me,
that from this very moment...

1387
02:10:09,647 --> 02:10:13,498
...you won't meet Ravi again!
- What are you saying?

1388
02:10:13,918 --> 02:10:18,557
Don't say that. Listen to me...
- You're wasting my time now.

1389
02:10:18,983 --> 02:10:22,409
And you're ruining my life!

1390
02:10:23,428 --> 02:10:24,850
Don't you care about that?

1391
02:10:25,763 --> 02:10:29,483
And are you bothered, that because
of you, a village will be ruined?

1392
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:33,789
Then... then what shall I do?

1393
02:10:38,113 --> 02:10:40,106
I'll give you 7 days.

1394
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:43,018
Marry somebody else by then.
- What!

1395
02:10:44,706 --> 02:10:46,610
So that Ravi will believe...

1396
02:10:46,965 --> 02:10:50,103
...that you're out of his life...
Forever!

1397
02:10:51,918 --> 02:10:54,420
No! This cannot be.

1398
02:10:54,713 --> 02:10:55,875
If it can't be...

1399
02:10:56,047 --> 02:11:00,253
...then every man in the village
will be homeless and out of job!

1400
02:11:01,028 --> 02:11:03,961
And you'll be responsible for this.
Not me, but only you!

1401
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:07,287
Don't say that. Don't be so cruel.

1402
02:11:07,902 --> 02:11:11,522
I'll do as you say. I promise.

1403
02:11:12,104 --> 02:11:13,631
I'll never utter Ravi's name.

1404
02:11:13,941 --> 02:11:18,346
I won't talk with him, but,
marrying somebody else...

1405
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,439
I beg you!

1406
02:11:21,773 --> 02:11:23,107
I won't be able to do it.

1407
02:11:24,412 --> 02:11:25,967
I can't do it...

1408
02:11:30,163 --> 02:11:33,207
And another thing...
Don't come here again.

1409
02:11:33,622 --> 02:11:39,752
I'll know if you're married or not.
And so will the villagers.

1410
02:11:45,824 --> 02:11:48,276
"If you refuse, I'll go away."

1411
02:11:49,665 --> 02:11:55,128
"I'll live somehow, but I swear,
I'll miss you every moment of it"

1412
02:11:56,612 --> 02:12:01,124
"Life will go on without you,
but it won't be worth living!"

1413
02:12:35,029 --> 02:12:35,959
No!

1414
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:39,346
This cannot be.
I just don't believe it.

1415
02:12:39,834 --> 02:12:43,006
But the sad part of
it is that it's true.

1416
02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:46,482
Mona will be married
in a few days now.

1417
02:12:52,149 --> 02:12:54,546
But with whom?

1418
02:12:55,067 --> 02:13:00,083
I couldn't find that out, but
the villagers say...

1419
02:13:00,664 --> 02:13:03,556
...that this is all due
to your grandma's pressure.

1420
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:26,850
Hats off, Grandma...

1421
02:13:29,625 --> 02:13:32,586
You'll dictate my life.

1422
02:13:34,149 --> 02:13:37,096
And what you don't want,
shall never happen.

1423
02:13:39,262 --> 02:13:43,067
If you don't wish it,
I can't meet Mona.

1424
02:13:45,536 --> 02:13:51,417
My life is firmly in your hands,
and it shall always be so.

1425
02:13:52,234 --> 02:13:57,000
If you come back, I'll
give you back your life.

1426
02:13:57,080 --> 02:14:00,211
No, no... No Grandma.

1427
02:14:00,902 --> 02:14:03,089
I've not come to return to you.

1428
02:14:04,071 --> 02:14:08,064
I've came just to tell you...

1429
02:14:08,983 --> 02:14:11,439
...that my life may be in your hands...

1430
02:14:13,274 --> 02:14:16,139
...but my death is in my own hands.

1431
02:14:19,342 --> 02:14:22,863
I agree that Mona will get married.

1432
02:14:24,752 --> 02:14:25,748
But that day...

1433
02:14:26,516 --> 02:14:29,124
That day will be the last day
of my life.

1434
02:14:31,988 --> 02:14:34,576
If my life is in your hands...

1435
02:14:35,849 --> 02:14:39,474
...then, the day Mona marries,
your hands will become empty.

1436
02:14:42,913 --> 02:14:44,332
You've won, Grandma.

1437
02:14:46,166 --> 02:14:47,556
But I won't lose either.

1438
02:15:02,631 --> 02:15:07,232
How are you, Cheena?
All well?

1439
02:15:10,692 --> 02:15:13,466
D'Silva wants to see you.

1440
02:15:17,299 --> 02:15:24,003
Raja, who else will I think
of except you, Raja?

1441
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:28,183
You know each other since
you both were kids.

1442
02:15:30,038 --> 02:15:32,888
And I always wished,
that you two would...

1443
02:15:35,719 --> 02:15:40,700
But now, the ball's in your court.
What do you say?

1444
02:15:47,979 --> 02:15:51,770
Okay, I'm ready for the marriage.

1445
02:15:52,252 --> 02:15:54,958
Yes, son Raja has come back.

1446
02:15:56,193 --> 02:16:00,980
He can help you. Shall
I go and talk to him?

1447
02:16:01,435 --> 02:16:05,000
No, don't.
I'll go myself. I'll...

1448
02:16:07,815 --> 02:16:12,094
But now, how can he help me?
- He'll do something.

1449
02:16:12,830 --> 02:16:14,341
He's your friend.

1450
02:16:15,105 --> 02:16:15,830
Raja!

1451
02:16:24,127 --> 02:16:27,182
Papa said you wanted to see me.

1452
02:16:28,478 --> 02:16:30,510
Oh yes. Come on in.

1453
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:35,343
Here, take this. Sit down.
- No thanks.

1454
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:47,321
I wanted to hear you say, that
you're willing for this marriage.

1455
02:16:51,494 --> 02:16:52,407
Is it true?

1456
02:16:53,071 --> 02:16:57,422
Raja. - Had you regarded me, a friend,
you wouldn't hide your pain from me.

1457
02:16:58,046 --> 02:17:00,155
I've come to know everything.

1458
02:17:01,783 --> 02:17:04,390
And I won't let you become
a sacrificial lamb.

1459
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:06,360
You're wrong.

1460
02:17:07,933 --> 02:17:09,920
I'll do it. I want to do it.

1461
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:11,835
Look at me!

1462
02:17:13,828 --> 02:17:15,240
Look into my eyes.

1463
02:17:16,268 --> 02:17:18,698
And now say that you
don't love Ravi.

1464
02:17:19,212 --> 02:17:22,788
That you can live without him.
And that you don't care for him.

1465
02:17:25,053 --> 02:17:25,922
Go on, say it!

1466
02:17:40,175 --> 02:17:40,867
Sit down.

1467
02:17:46,685 --> 02:17:50,022
Mona, did you give
a thought to Ravi?

1468
02:17:50,531 --> 02:17:56,059
He made everybody his foe, for you.
And you gave in so easily?

1469
02:17:56,847 --> 02:18:00,237
I'm not giving in, Raja.
But what can I do? Tell me.

1470
02:18:01,054 --> 02:18:04,465
If I don't marry somebody else,
the company people will...

1471
02:18:05,775 --> 02:18:08,144
You think if you ruin your life...

1472
02:18:08,576 --> 02:18:11,349
...the Company people will allow
this village to live freely?

1473
02:18:13,597 --> 02:18:16,088
If they can ruin this town...

1474
02:18:16,509 --> 02:18:20,904
...even if you kill yourself, they'll
do it. If not now, then later.

1475
02:18:21,237 --> 02:18:26,230
But, we'll fight. And this
fight will continue.

1476
02:18:29,939 --> 02:18:33,371
Look. Don't spoil your own life.

1477
02:18:34,456 --> 02:18:36,393
Whatever may happen,
I'll see to it.

1478
02:18:41,248 --> 02:18:44,364
Now wipe your tears. And listen.

1479
02:18:45,466 --> 02:18:47,442
Tonight I'm taking you to Ravi.

1480
02:18:48,975 --> 02:18:51,228
You both go away
very far from here.

1481
02:18:52,202 --> 02:18:55,108
Let's see who stops you!

1482
02:18:56,953 --> 02:18:57,595
Now, come.

1483
02:18:57,675 --> 02:19:00,983
And remember, don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

1484
02:19:06,578 --> 02:19:10,018
I thought Gods existed
only in stories.

1485
02:19:14,277 --> 02:19:15,013
Mona!

1486
02:19:17,271 --> 02:19:19,546
Everyone is not blessed
to be a human-being.

1487
02:19:20,498 --> 02:19:24,445
Some people have to become God!

1488
02:19:26,828 --> 02:19:27,859
Now go.

1489
02:19:29,256 --> 02:19:30,495
Go on, go...

1490
02:19:40,034 --> 02:19:44,268
But why are you doing this?
So okay, friendship is fine.

1491
02:19:44,677 --> 02:19:48,115
But I won't let you
risk your life like this.

1492
02:19:49,609 --> 02:19:54,072
I know you're feeling
very bad for me.

1493
02:19:54,535 --> 02:19:56,210
That's why you're saying this.

1494
02:19:57,047 --> 02:19:58,396
But whatever I'm doing...

1495
02:19:58,846 --> 02:20:01,870
...had Ravi been in my shoes,
he'd have done the same.

1496
02:20:04,548 --> 02:20:07,122
And when I had told him about
my love, accidentally...

1497
02:20:09,121 --> 02:20:10,519
...he had done the same.

1498
02:20:12,699 --> 02:20:13,972
May be, even more.

1499
02:20:14,166 --> 02:20:15,840
What can be more than this?

1500
02:20:17,728 --> 02:20:22,073
Don't I know, how you,
laughed off your lifelong love...

1501
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:24,785
...in a mere moment?

1502
02:20:25,809 --> 02:20:27,006
And those two...

1503
02:20:27,650 --> 02:20:31,428
...thinking it a joke,
have already forgotten it!

1504
02:20:36,936 --> 02:20:39,662
Why don't you also take it
as a joke, and forget it?

1505
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:43,751
You're telling me this?
Will you be able to forget?

1506
02:20:48,372 --> 02:20:49,147
No.

1507
02:20:51,887 --> 02:20:53,859
I love Mona, even today.

1508
02:20:53,939 --> 02:20:58,211
...and I'll always love her.
It has gone waste but hasn't ended.

1509
02:20:58,543 --> 02:21:01,816
It's a fact that I'll never
forget my love for Mona.

1510
02:21:03,406 --> 02:21:06,208
But neither can I forget
the love of Mona and Ravi.

1511
02:21:09,148 --> 02:21:12,517
Today I'll bring them
together... for good.

1512
02:21:16,178 --> 02:21:19,928
It's expected of me
and I'll do it.

1513
02:21:29,267 --> 02:21:32,581
But I think you should
take it easy.

1514
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:36,718
Ravi will himself apologise.
- He'll not come.

1515
02:21:39,492 --> 02:21:41,935
He has his father's blood in him!

1516
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:44,813
He'll give his life for her.

1517
02:21:45,089 --> 02:21:47,788
He'll commit suicide, but
he'll never come back!

1518
02:21:50,653 --> 02:21:53,261
I lost my own son once, like this.

1519
02:21:54,942 --> 02:21:58,623
But now, I can't lose Ravi too.

1520
02:22:00,379 --> 02:22:04,205
Go and tell him, I agree
to whatever he says.

1521
02:22:06,102 --> 02:22:08,693
He has won. And I have lost.

1522
02:22:15,322 --> 02:22:16,845
This is...

1523
02:22:16,925 --> 02:22:19,169
How was I to know that
the old hag will suddenly...

1524
02:22:19,249 --> 02:22:23,929
...get a spurt of love for Ravi?
- And what a fantastic spurt too!

1525
02:22:24,009 --> 02:22:29,824
But this doesn't mean I'll let my
lifelong hopes be drowned like this.

1526
02:22:30,350 --> 02:22:34,543
Kamladevi's property and
wealth, should come to me!

1527
02:22:34,896 --> 02:22:36,238
Only me!

1528
02:22:37,491 --> 02:22:39,476
And this will be decided...

1529
02:22:40,328 --> 02:22:42,833
...tonight itself!

1530
02:22:54,206 --> 02:22:56,635
You're not leaving forever.

1531
02:22:57,196 --> 02:23:01,119
One day you'll come to meet
us all, with Ravi. Isn't it?

1532
02:23:04,315 --> 02:23:08,148
If anyone sees you leaving
the village... Come on!

1533
02:23:45,592 --> 02:23:48,879
Well? Where are you taking her?

1534
02:23:50,506 --> 02:23:54,332
Look. Today I'm in a hurry.

1535
02:23:55,882 --> 02:24:00,137
And you people too...
- Hey, you girl...

1536
02:24:00,372 --> 02:24:01,431
Hold on.

1537
02:24:03,603 --> 02:24:04,731
You go, Mona.

1538
02:24:09,934 --> 02:24:12,833
Raja!
- You go to Ravi.

1539
02:24:12,913 --> 02:24:14,494
I'll tend to these people.

1540
02:24:45,461 --> 02:24:49,075
I should have gone away
much earlier. Anyway...

1541
02:24:49,302 --> 02:24:52,507
If not then, now at least.
- But, Ravi, you...

1542
02:24:55,589 --> 02:25:00,809
If it's Raja, I'm not here.
I've already gone.

1543
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:14,969
Where is Ravi?
- But, who are you?

1544
02:25:15,049 --> 02:25:18,606
Don't ask questions, old
geyser. Just answer us.

1545
02:25:18,911 --> 02:25:20,605
Where's Ravi?
- Here I am.

1546
02:25:23,825 --> 02:25:24,650
What do you want?

1547
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:25,690
Ravi...

1548
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:27,224
Uncle...

1549
02:25:39,384 --> 02:25:40,131
Vikram!

1550
02:25:40,563 --> 02:25:41,974
Yes, Ravi. It's me.

1551
02:25:44,133 --> 02:25:45,660
But why be so surprised?

1552
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:48,019
No, I'm not surprised.

1553
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,834
I know you're a swine.

1554
02:25:51,175 --> 02:25:54,197
But I never knew you were
a rascal, and so cheap too.

1555
02:25:54,912 --> 02:25:59,583
Call me anything you wish,
but the fact remains...

1556
02:25:59,663 --> 02:26:03,353
...that the real heir to
Kamladevi's estate...

1557
02:26:04,111 --> 02:26:04,930
...is me.

1558
02:26:06,448 --> 02:26:08,186
But that adamant hag...

1559
02:26:08,762 --> 02:26:12,166
...wants to hand over all
her estate and wealth to you.

1560
02:26:13,157 --> 02:26:15,091
Because you are her blood!

1561
02:26:16,175 --> 02:26:17,830
Mona...
- Ravi...

1562
02:26:17,910 --> 02:26:20,841
Why do they want to kill you?
Don't kill him.

1563
02:26:21,028 --> 02:26:22,794
You're very lucky, Ravi.

1564
02:26:24,056 --> 02:26:26,630
Even your last wish is fulfilled.

1565
02:26:28,218 --> 02:26:31,550
Before dying, meet your beloved too.

1566
02:26:32,945 --> 02:26:36,775
Now you shouldn't feel
so very bad to die!

1567
02:26:37,599 --> 02:26:42,542
What are you saying? What do you
have against him? Why kill him?

1568
02:26:42,818 --> 02:26:46,571
Don't kill him... I beg you.
Don't kill him.

1569
02:26:46,651 --> 02:26:47,717
No, Mona...

1570
02:26:59,401 --> 02:27:02,701
My heart has melted
seeing your love for him.

1571
02:27:03,262 --> 02:27:06,645
Okay. I won't kill him.

1572
02:27:08,009 --> 02:27:09,310
Don't believe me?

1573
02:27:17,426 --> 02:27:20,567
Ravi, your Grandma thinks...

1574
02:27:21,204 --> 02:27:24,160
...that you love this girl
so much, that for her...

1575
02:27:24,942 --> 02:27:28,789
...you'll even commit suicide!

1576
02:27:33,217 --> 02:27:36,656
If you can really do it, then...

1577
02:27:38,213 --> 02:27:42,060
Turn around. Go to that revolver...

1578
02:27:43,623 --> 02:27:47,436
...pick it up;
Aim it at your temple...

1579
02:27:49,456 --> 02:27:53,269
And pull the trigger. Else...

1580
02:27:54,645 --> 02:27:55,454
No!

1581
02:29:35,354 --> 02:29:37,665
Raja!
- Mona, you're alright, aren't you?

1582
02:29:43,889 --> 02:29:45,976
But where's Ravi?
- Ravi?

1583
02:29:48,516 --> 02:29:49,446
There he is!

1584
02:29:51,406 --> 02:29:53,100
Come on, let's not waste time.

1585
02:29:53,321 --> 02:29:56,116
Before any further trouble,
you both get out of here.

1586
02:29:56,277 --> 02:29:59,072
And you?
- Forget it.

1587
02:29:59,853 --> 02:30:03,135
Look Ravi, you both
better get out of here, very fast.

1588
02:30:04,065 --> 02:30:06,434
Yes. I'm going.

1589
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:08,676
But alone.

1590
02:30:09,511 --> 02:30:10,303
Ravi!

1591
02:30:10,823 --> 02:30:12,617
This afternoon I had
been to your house.

1592
02:30:13,718 --> 02:30:15,821
I heard you talking to Miss Joseph.

1593
02:30:21,504 --> 02:30:22,323
Raja...

1594
02:30:24,466 --> 02:30:26,237
What did you and Miss Joseph
talk about?

1595
02:30:26,786 --> 02:30:28,208
Nothing.

1596
02:30:28,580 --> 02:30:33,323
What matters is that you love...
- There's another matter too Mona.

1597
02:30:34,718 --> 02:30:37,358
Which if I hide from you, will
seem very dishonest of me.

1598
02:30:38,865 --> 02:30:41,909
Raja loves you.

1599
02:30:43,670 --> 02:30:46,681
Long before I ever did, and may
be much more than I do.

1600
02:30:48,229 --> 02:30:50,989
No. This is not true. Not true!

1601
02:30:51,069 --> 02:30:53,133
It is true, Mona.
The only truth!

1602
02:30:54,351 --> 02:30:58,502
We were lost in our happiness
and never knew Raja's heartbreak.

1603
02:30:59,636 --> 02:31:01,940
We laughed, and
he laughed with us.

1604
02:31:03,358 --> 02:31:07,793
We never saw that his laughter
crossed many a sea of sorrow.

1605
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:15,059
You are Raja's hope, desire, life.
Only you, Mona.

1606
02:31:16,884 --> 02:31:21,444
But see, today also, he's handing
over his life to me!

1607
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:22,765
No...

1608
02:31:25,463 --> 02:31:26,792
Make him understand, Mona.

1609
02:31:28,106 --> 02:31:30,936
It's not like that. Tell him, Mona.

1610
02:31:31,704 --> 02:31:35,191
I'm nothing in your eyes.
We're poles apart, Mona.

1611
02:31:36,083 --> 02:31:39,162
How can I even dare
to think that you...

1612
02:31:40,823 --> 02:31:43,314
And even if I did dare...
So what?

1613
02:31:47,071 --> 02:31:49,092
If a child cries for the moon...

1614
02:31:50,573 --> 02:31:52,753
...he hardly gets to hold it.

1615
02:31:57,312 --> 02:31:58,323
Raja...

1616
02:31:59,637 --> 02:32:02,024
One shouldn't be so very nice...

1617
02:32:03,636 --> 02:32:05,705
...as to make others feel
so very ashamed.

1618
02:32:08,963 --> 02:32:11,862
What didn't you do for me?

1619
02:32:13,592 --> 02:32:14,575
And I...

1620
02:32:16,871 --> 02:32:18,414
I just made you sad.

1621
02:32:20,628 --> 02:32:23,084
Why did you oblige me so?
- But I haven't...

1622
02:32:24,143 --> 02:32:26,384
I've not obliged anybody.

1623
02:32:27,906 --> 02:32:30,169
I just did what my heart dictated.

1624
02:32:31,366 --> 02:32:34,293
Now you also listen to your
own heart. Go with him.

1625
02:32:34,922 --> 02:32:40,463
Start a new life, with...
- We can't do that, Mona!

1626
02:32:41,153 --> 02:32:42,620
When I know everything.

1627
02:32:45,403 --> 02:32:48,741
Even if I get you, this guilt
will never let me live...

1628
02:32:50,057 --> 02:32:53,982
Forget me, and think of yourself.
Will you be able to crush his dream?

1629
02:32:54,154 --> 02:32:57,945
Will you be happy by making him sad,
and face yourself in the mirror?

1630
02:32:58,025 --> 02:32:59,595
No! No! No!

1631
02:33:00,331 --> 02:33:01,167
No!

1632
02:33:05,721 --> 02:33:07,741
What's wrong with you two?

1633
02:33:08,366 --> 02:33:10,508
Now that your goal is near...

1634
02:33:10,588 --> 02:33:13,387
...why are you punishing
yourselves in this manner?

1635
02:33:13,951 --> 02:33:14,648
Go...

1636
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:41,416
Raja!

1637
02:33:42,511 --> 02:33:44,019
Raja!

1638
02:33:50,314 --> 02:33:51,525
Vikram!

1639
02:34:41,935 --> 02:34:42,883
Raja!

1640
02:34:43,754 --> 02:34:48,433
Come, Mona.
- No... Listen to me.

1641
02:34:48,513 --> 02:34:50,492
Oh no...
- No...

1642
02:34:52,828 --> 02:34:57,558
What life couldn't decide,
Death has decided.

1643
02:34:57,638 --> 02:35:01,502
No, Raja, No!
- You'll be fine, Raja.

1644
02:35:02,764 --> 02:35:03,906
Raja!

1645
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:09,546
Son!

1646
02:35:15,293 --> 02:35:16,420
Miss Joseph!

1647
02:35:17,174 --> 02:35:18,129
Raja!

1648
02:35:19,424 --> 02:35:22,122
What happened to you, son?
What's wrong?

1649
02:35:22,586 --> 02:35:23,728
What's wrong?

1650
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:41,714
The arms that gave me life,
let death too come in them!

1651
02:35:42,593 --> 02:35:45,520
What more can I want?
- No, my son.

1652
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:49,553
Don't say that... Don't!

1653
02:35:50,211 --> 02:35:51,906
Don't say that.

1654
02:35:54,202 --> 02:35:55,330
Miss Joseph!

1655
02:35:58,438 --> 02:35:59,960
Make the villagers understand...

1656
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:10,787
Don't separate these
two from each other.

1657
02:36:13,319 --> 02:36:18,905
They both... love each other...

1658
02:36:20,626 --> 02:36:21,958
...very much...
