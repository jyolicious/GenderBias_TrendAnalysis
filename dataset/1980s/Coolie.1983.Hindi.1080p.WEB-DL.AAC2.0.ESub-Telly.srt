1
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:16,818
Dear.
- Yes.

2
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:17,861
Come here.

3
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,847
What is this?

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,689
A dress for you on
this festival of Eid.

5
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,030
Gorgeous!

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,639
You're looking like a newly wed.

7
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:34,099
Stop it! Wear it for some
more time, mom.

8
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:38,696
I couldn't see you wearing these
clothes at your wedding,

9
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:40,523
because I wasn't there.

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,147
Let me watch you now.

11
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:43,766
I'll slap you.

12
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:47,183
My nephew is absolutely correct.
Why are you scolding him?

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:50,673
Greetings Mr Maruti! Come in.
- Greetings!

14
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:53,170
You really look wonderful!

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,422
Keep it here.

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,775
Even your wife is beautiful.
- That's what I'm saying.

17
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:02,649
Look at my kid.
He looks like his mother.

18
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,509
What are you saying?
- Quiet!

19
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,266
God has tattooed
my complexion on his sole.

20
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:12,919
If he would've taken my
complexion even by mistake,

21
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,152
we had to mark twice for
removing to prevent bad luck!

22
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,679
A black mark is very auspicious.

23
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:22,898
Auspicious? His soles have wheels.
He moves so quickly!

24
00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:27,392
I'll always cherish this day.

25
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,942
No one would forget
such an auspicious day.

26
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,690
Maruti, are you in Mumbai now?

27
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,418
I have a good hold over Mumbai.

28
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,111
The train won't move
until I reach the station.

29
00:01:37,424 --> 00:01:38,654
Give brother too.

30
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,256
Have it brother.

31
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,467
It's time to leave for duty.

32
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:46,921
I'll go with you too.
- Yes! Quickly eat!

33
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:48,919
Wrap him tight.

34
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,799
You promised to take me.
- I'll take you!

35
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:55,159
We'll leave to catch our train.
- So early?

36
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,797
I'll drop her at Kolhapur
and leave for Mumbai.

37
00:01:57,887 --> 00:01:59,649
Come along, brother, I'll drop you
at the bus stop. - Let's go.

38
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:00,830
Bye, dear.
- Bye.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,706
Come son.

40
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:03,995
Good bye sister!
- Okay.

41
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:08,946
'CENTRAL JAIL'

42
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:13,770
Welcome sir.

43
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:16,290
Congratulations on your
release after 10 long years.

44
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,159
Just one garland?

45
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:21,249
Where's the second one?
- Second?

46
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,631
The other garland that I was
supposed to offer Salma?

47
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:28,855
Why are you quiet?

48
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,057
It's too late.

49
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:31,809
Salma..
- What happened?

50
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,675
Salma got married
after you were jailed.

51
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:35,747
No!

52
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:38,379
She can't get married
to someone else.

53
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:44,109
It would be my defeat and
I've never learnt to accept defeat.

54
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:50,385
Recognize me?
- Zafar?

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,307
Did you think I would
never return from jail?

56
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:57,014
That you got your daughter
married to someone else.

57
00:02:57,501 --> 00:02:59,883
We learnt your true colours.

58
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:03,786
You're a murderer!
You've cheated people of millions!

59
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:08,466
I did all that for your daughter.

60
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:11,409
And you got her married
to a beggar!

61
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:14,909
Listen! You still have a chance.

62
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,592
Get her divorced
and married to me.

63
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:18,874
Divorce?

64
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,003
Impossible!

65
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,323
I prefer my daughter to die,

66
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:30,658
rather than getting her married
to a devil like you.

67
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:36,773
I'll kill your son-in-law and
forcefully take Salma away.

68
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:40,133
No, I won't let that happen.

69
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,598
Move!
- Zafar!

70
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:46,443
Zafar, it's a crime!

71
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,363
At least fear god.

72
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:51,862
I am god,
I'm not scared of any other god.

73
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:18,767
Let's go, Goga.

74
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:30,322
Allah Rakha...

75
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:41,646
You have stayed with us for years.
You must look after my family.

76
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:44,095
It is your responsibility.

77
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,745
Deliver this message to Salma.

78
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,520
Fly away!

79
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,186
You?

80
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,052
Why are you here?

81
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:21,253
To take Salma
whom I was to marry 10 years ago.

82
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,491
Have some shame.
I'm a married woman.

83
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:28,416
I don't follow
the rules of society.

84
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:32,678
The world knows
I acquire what I want.

85
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,781
I'm stubborn by birth.

86
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,971
How many doors will you close?

87
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,434
I'll break open
all the doors of the world.

88
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,882
Be afraid of God and His wrath.

89
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:49,678
Neither do I believe in God,
nor His wrath.

90
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,094
I'm a disaster for the one
who doesn't listen to me.

91
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:07,087
Wait, Zafar!
I'll make this fire a pyre for you.

92
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,219
Don't be a fool.

93
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,594
Look at his hut.

94
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:14,046
I'll keep you in a palace
and bathe you in gems.

95
00:06:14,136 --> 00:06:16,094
For an Indian woman like me,

96
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:19,136
a husband's house is a palace,

97
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:24,980
this scarf she wears
is as good as silk

98
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:31,052
and the dust of my husband's feet
is more than your gems.

99
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,678
Really?

100
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:35,136
What if I kill your husband?

101
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,720
There'll be
two dead bodies lying here,

102
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:40,052
one, my husband's and mine.

103
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:44,177
Get out or I'll call
the entire neighbourhood.

104
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:47,553
They'll drive you out
after a good thrashing.

105
00:06:49,177 --> 00:06:50,177
Good.

106
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,136
I'm leaving this place right now,

107
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,636
but I'll leave this city
only with my Salma.

108
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,469
What's the matter, Allahrakha?

109
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:46,400
He's the one.

110
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:19,749
Dad!

111
00:08:22,494 --> 00:08:24,261
Dad!

112
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:29,805
Dad! Let me go.

113
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:31,848
Dad!

114
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:23,764
Oh, lord!

115
00:09:24,387 --> 00:09:26,122
Mom!

116
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,977
Goga!

117
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,557
Mother!

118
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,349
Take us too!

119
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,696
Get lost!

120
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,306
Apply a black mark on him
once you reach Kolhapur.

121
00:10:51,396 --> 00:10:53,063
Stop!

122
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,270
Why did you stop the cart?

123
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:59,556
Can't you see the water ahead?

124
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,640
It's risky to proceed.

125
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,344
He's correct, let's not go.

126
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:06,142
Don't get scared by his warnings.
- You don't worry.

127
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:11,098
We'll miss the bus.
Take Rs. 20 and let's go.

128
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:14,689
Come on! Move!
- They only want money.

129
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:19,049
No, please listen to me.

130
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,407
My son! Save my son.

131
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:34,145
Parvati!
- Save my son.

132
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,938
My son!

133
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:41,406
Parvati!
- Help!

134
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:48,489
Parvati!

135
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,261
My son! Help!

136
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:53,051
Parvati!

137
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:57,347
No! My son!

138
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:01,345
My, son! Please someone
save my son.

139
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,390
Parvati!

140
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,305
I'm an orphan now.

141
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:25,719
I have no one now!

142
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,015
God, despite your presence,
you made me an orphan.

143
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,107
Uncle!

144
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,125
You lost everything,
so did I.

145
00:12:49,345 --> 00:12:53,633
We have to support each other.
Let's go.

146
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:56,811
The accident
has left her traumatised.

147
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,398
She has lost her speech.

148
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,145
Can she never speak?

149
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,603
Did she have a child?
- Yes, but...

150
00:13:02,693 --> 00:13:05,750
Get him. We can't treat her
unless he's here.

151
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,651
How can we find her child?
- I'm sorry.

152
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,379
It's necessary to get her child.

153
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:12,321
Doctor!
- Coming!

154
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,553
But doctor...

155
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:15,512
Why are you worried?

156
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,121
We'll get a kid somehow.

157
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:22,088
Today's breaking news!

158
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,345
America created a hydrogen bomb!
Aeroplanes are on a 7-day strike.

159
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,806
Today's breaking news!

160
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:29,804
Uncle Rahim!

161
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,361
It's a one-day journey...

162
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:32,762
When you reach...
- Hello, Uncle Rahim.

163
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,414
Greetings, son.

164
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,480
Are you going to Ajmer Sharif?
- No.

165
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,609
Today's breaking news. America...
- Hey, paper boy.

166
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:44,720
Today's...

167
00:13:45,261 --> 00:13:48,829
Are you going to Ajmer Sharif?
- No!

168
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:54,326
Sir, be seated.
I'll be back with the change. - Okay.

169
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,921
Bob, I've established
a chit fund office

170
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,879
for you in Mumbai too.
- Okay.

171
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:05,558
But make sure my name
doesn't appear in these matters.

172
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,762
Understand?

173
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,536
Come.

174
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:13,487
Sir.

175
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:16,553
Sir.

176
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,208
Madam, are you going to Ajmer?

177
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,914
Will you offer a sacred sheet
at the shrine?

178
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,172
Pray that I get my mom back.

179
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,178
Mother!

180
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:39,879
Mom, where were you?

181
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,046
This is my mom!

182
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,795
I'm her son, Iqbal!
- Get out!

183
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:46,932
Get out!
- Let go of me! Mother!

184
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,545
Nurse, bring the child.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,053
Madam, this is your son.

186
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:56,753
Get out!

187
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:58,755
What happened?

188
00:14:58,845 --> 00:15:00,637
Thank God,
Salma lost her memory,

189
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,885
or this boy
would've taken her away.

190
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:04,804
Do I kill him?
- Kill him.

191
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:06,921
Mom!

192
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,386
Come on, silly kid!

193
00:15:09,512 --> 00:15:10,969
Stand still.

194
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,608
Bob!
- Let go! Mother!

195
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,553
Mom!

196
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,637
Leave me!

197
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,063
Mom!

198
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:26,755
Don't go away, mom,
I'm your son, Iqbal.

199
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:29,795
Don't leave me!

200
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,588
For God's sake,
don't leave me!

201
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:34,921
I'm your son!
Stop, mother!

202
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:38,755
For God's sake, don't leave me!
Stop, mother!

203
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:40,755
Don't leave!

204
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,423
I'm your son.

205
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:47,595
Why don't you speak, mom?

206
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:53,011
Don't leave me!

207
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:08,885
Mother!

208
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,594
Leave me!

209
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:24,068
Uncle!

210
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,668
You scoundrel!

211
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:43,545
Uncle!

212
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,466
Scoundrel!

213
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:30,676
Don't worry, uncle,
I'm your right hand from today.

214
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,212
We'll share all our troubles!

215
00:17:36,824 --> 00:17:41,753
Allah Rakha, both of us will
take care of porters from now on.

216
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,834
'415 Express train...'

217
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:55,027
'arriving by...'

218
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,155
'INDIAN RAILWAYS'

219
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,188
Porter!

220
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:20,034
Come.

221
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:25,970
'Brother!'

222
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:30,586
Hurry up!

223
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,957
Quickly!

224
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:38,215
You dropped the dog!

225
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:42,406
You scoundrel! You dropped
my dog.

226
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,644
Bloody fool!

227
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,346
Sir, why are you beating a porter?

228
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,430
What's the matter, uncle?

229
00:18:56,871 --> 00:18:58,758
Hey, he is bleeding!

230
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:07,042
Sir, you can't
beat them up like this.

231
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:10,542
You dog! How dare you touch me!

232
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,625
Don't move!

233
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:20,042
I'll suspend you! I'm a member
of the railway advisory board.

234
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,845
You thrashed our colleague
and we...

235
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:26,667
Don't you dare move
or else I'll shoot.

236
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:29,375
What can you do?

237
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,272
What's the matter, Allahrakha?

238
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:50,619
Really?

239
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,750
Let's see.

240
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:27,696
Who are you?

241
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:34,326
Open the window for a while.

242
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,251
My introduction is very lengthy.

243
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,125
I've the blessings of God
right from childhood,

244
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,667
and I've got Allahrakha with me.

245
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,618
I've got badge no. 786,
I smoke cigar no. 20, I'm a porter

246
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,482
and my name is...
- Iqbal!

247
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,942
The one whom I hit on the head,
becomes bald.

248
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,084
What do you want?

249
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,750
A worker should get his wages
before his sweat dries.

250
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:01,209
But he got a thrashing.

251
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:04,332
It's better
that you apologize to him.

252
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:05,332
Never.

253
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:07,750
No?

254
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,667
Think about it.

255
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:16,375
If a porter, who lifts others'
burdens becomes a burden on you,

256
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:18,583
you'll have a tough time.

257
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,251
Seems you'll leave
only after a good fight.

258
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,251
Where will I go?

259
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,009
The railway platform is our home.
What say, brothers? - Yes!

260
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,708
These are the guests.
- Yes.

261
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,058
So house owners will...
- Stay back!

262
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,105
And guests...
- Will leave!

263
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,209
What say, brother?

264
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,995
Would you like to try?

265
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,625
Allarakha, watch the fun.
- Come.

266
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:45,667
Don't you dare!

267
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,625
Move away!

268
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,881
Police!
- Catch him!

269
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,506
Arrest him.

270
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:54,143
Sir, please arrest the bearded man.

271
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,110
Leave me!

272
00:22:58,262 --> 00:23:00,256
What have I done?

273
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:01,756
He did everything!

274
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,047
Me?
- Yes!

275
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:04,826
One minute!
Leave me.

276
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:16,250
Sir, our presence
doesn't create a fuss.

277
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,917
But a fuss is created
if we're absent.

278
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:22,440
Do you want to see how?

279
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,445
Strike!

280
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:43,244
Strike!

281
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,445
Hello, sir.

282
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,819
Why did you stop the train?

283
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:15,403
To register a complaint.

284
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:16,693
A complaint?
- Yes.

285
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:20,612
The chairman's son hit an
old porter, he's in the hospital.

286
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:24,612
We raised a voice, but the
police arrested our leader, Iqbal.

287
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,777
Please give us justice.

288
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:29,653
PA!
- Yes!

289
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,629
Call a board meeting
and call their leader too.

290
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,762
I'll investigate this.

291
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:39,570
A board member is the culprit,
how will you investigate?

292
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,361
Spare time for the poor as well.

293
00:26:44,614 --> 00:26:48,736
You have no idea
how we live in pain, in tears.

294
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:51,903
No one listens to the poor!

295
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:55,153
They apply bandages to dogs,

296
00:26:55,944 --> 00:26:58,278
but for us, they have no balm,

297
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:01,612
no bandage, no provident fund
or hospitals.

298
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:06,861
We shoulder the burden of the world
but no one shoulders our burden.

299
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:16,693
We have concluded, that
the mistake is yours, Mr Puri.

300
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:18,320
What?
- You have to apologize to him.

301
00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:21,194
Do I have to say sorry to him?
No!

302
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:23,111
Well then, please resign.

303
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,111
He has heart trouble.

304
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:34,693
A person without a heart
can't have heart disease.

305
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,641
It's epilepsy.
Smell my shoes!

306
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,612
Stop that nonsense!

307
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:43,578
See, it's neither heart disease,
nor epilepsy.

308
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:44,736
Quiet!

309
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:49,693
I'd rather resign
than apologize to him!

310
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:52,438
There he goes.

311
00:27:52,528 --> 00:27:55,861
Mr. Puri has resigned.
Can you call off the strike?

312
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:59,320
As you wish, sir.
When I say it's over, it's over.

313
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,710
'19483' 'N U D S 4B'

314
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:42,013
"Porter!"

315
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,332
"Porter!"

316
00:28:44,105 --> 00:28:48,798
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

317
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:53,881
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

318
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:58,131
"We lift it."

319
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:03,297
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

320
00:29:03,387 --> 00:29:07,547
"People arrive and depart,"

321
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:12,214
"but we remain here."

322
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:17,556
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

323
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:56,721
Idiot!
- I'm not an idiot, I'm Iqbal.

324
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:57,987
Wow!

325
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:02,881
I think God has created you giving
special instructions to angels.

326
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:05,381
Shameless!
You ruined my dress!

327
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:08,033
Your dress is ruined but

328
00:30:08,637 --> 00:30:11,707
your face is blooming like a rose.

329
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,721
Let's go, porter.

330
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:24,429
"You give a one-time charge
for work by four."

331
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:29,121
"You give a one-time charge
for work by four."

332
00:30:29,211 --> 00:30:31,547
"Don't suck our blood."

333
00:30:31,637 --> 00:30:34,102
"Or take away something else."

334
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:36,387
"You have paid one rupee less."

335
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:43,159
"I swear on God
that we work hard."

336
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:47,679
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

337
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:52,798
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

338
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:31,672
"We quench our hunger and thirst,
having water and praying to God."

339
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:40,631
"We quench our hunger and thirst,
having water and praying to God."

340
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:45,171
"We work
in every situation."

341
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:49,756
"We enjoy one holiday,
on the festival of Eid."

342
00:31:49,846 --> 00:31:54,090
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

343
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,063
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

344
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:33,547
"Our life is difficult,"

345
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:38,090
"even we have a heart."

346
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:46,013
"We are humans
and we have aspirations too."

347
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:51,013
"Our life is difficult,"

348
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:56,131
"even we have a heart."

349
00:32:56,221 --> 00:33:04,429
"We are humans
and we have aspirations too."

350
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:09,261
"When we are sad, we enjoy."

351
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:15,512
"When we are sad, we enjoy,"

352
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:20,013
"smoke a cigar
and eat betel leaves."

353
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:24,923
"We lift the weight
of the entire world"

354
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:29,096
"People arrive and depart,"

355
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:33,471
"but we remain here itself."

356
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:37,888
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

357
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:42,846
"We lift the weight
of the entire world."

358
00:34:32,074 --> 00:34:33,178
Here you go!

359
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:39,376
Mom, this is
my last application for a job.

360
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:45,367
If I don't get a reporter's job,
I'll start selling newspapers.

361
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:48,653
Mr Sunny,
Mr Iyengar is calling you. - Yeah?

362
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:52,109
I think I got a job!

363
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,307
Look after my belongings.

364
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:56,616
Come in.

365
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,122
Hello, sir.
- Where?

366
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:13,443
I'm here!
Greetings! What?

367
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,742
Hello.
- Greetings.

368
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:17,650
I'm Sunny.
- Okay.

369
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:21,836
I've studied journalism in London.
- Very good!

370
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,740
I'm a son of a rich man too.
- Really?

371
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,992
My dad can buy such presses
if he wants.

372
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:32,075
Then do buy them.
- No.

373
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:37,526
I want to stand on my own two feet,
without my dad's support.

374
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:40,652
What are you standing on
right now?

375
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:46,332
If you want to stand on your feet,
make our press stand first,

376
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,867
because our newspapers get printed,
but they don't sell.

377
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:57,199
Bring front page news,

378
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:00,645
that our paper gets sold
before it's even printed.

379
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:05,925
Anna, I'll bring front page news!
- Very good God!

380
00:36:06,115 --> 00:36:10,199
Thank you very much, God!
You're great.

381
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:13,864
Savitri!
- I'm coming. What's the matter?

382
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:19,116
Savitri, tomorrow the advocate's
family is coming to see Deepa.

383
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:21,971
Yes! - I bought
a beautiful sari for her.

384
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,285
Look, it's lovely!

385
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,950
What's the use of a sari
if our daughter is absent?

386
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,115
Where is our daughter?
- She must've gone there.

387
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,034
Catch them!
- Police!

388
00:37:07,629 --> 00:37:09,495
'MUNICIPAL GENERAL HOSPITAL'

389
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:14,616
I'll provide you news,
but what will I get in return?

390
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:17,505
Here.

391
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:20,924
Wow! I saw...
- Speak in Hindi!

392
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:25,044
Last night, one lady gave birth
to 7 children.

393
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:27,658
7 children?

394
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:30,902
The 8th kid is to be born!
Call the doctor!

395
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:33,158
God!
It's hurting!

396
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:51,483
No. 7!

397
00:37:53,158 --> 00:37:56,158
It's a fact!

398
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:02,325
Madam, 7 at a time at one go?

399
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:07,068
Fantastic!
Congratulations, madam!

400
00:38:07,158 --> 00:38:10,700
Madam, 1 photograph please.
Thank you.

401
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:12,533
Smile!

402
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:14,658
Okay!

403
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,241
That's it!
Very good!

404
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:19,443
This is our daughter Deepa.

405
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,394
Hello.
- Hello!

406
00:38:21,788 --> 00:38:23,831
Deepa, have a seat.

407
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:27,491
Sit.
- Walk properly!

408
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:30,950
Get them married
as early as possible.

409
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,658
I'll print the news of
their marriage on the front page.

410
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,491
Like this.

411
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:42,735
Oh God!
- Oh God!

412
00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:48,000
Why are you so shocked?
I won't charge you for that.

413
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:49,443
It's my press.

414
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:50,818
Have a glance at the paper.

415
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:53,575
No need to see the paper!

416
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,930
Shut up!
Whose daughter is this?

417
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:57,867
Is she the neighbour's?

418
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:00,408
She's definitely our daughter!

419
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:02,034
Whose 7 kids are these?

420
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:08,988
This girl is ours,
but the 7 kids aren't hers.

421
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:10,521
See that!

422
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:13,616
Listen to me!
- Move!

423
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:26,435
Father!

424
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,626
Mother!

425
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:31,372
Close the door! Let's go!

426
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,425
Deepa!

427
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:40,491
Deepa!

428
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:41,950
Deepa!

429
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:43,476
Deepa, why are you crying?

430
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:47,325
Why didn't you tell me
that you're leaving school?

431
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:52,564
We're going to London for my mom's
treatment and will stay there.

432
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:56,325
Even my parents
wanted me to go to another school,

433
00:39:56,415 --> 00:40:00,783
but I refused, for you.
And you're leaving me?

434
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:03,699
I'll return
once I complete studying.

435
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:06,401
Write to me
and I'll stay in touch too.

436
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:07,575
Sunny!

437
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,783
Yes, coming.

438
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:16,158
Keep my photo with you
and I'll keep yours with me.

439
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,283
Let's go.

440
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:28,950
I'm in this state today
because of you.

441
00:40:29,366 --> 00:40:31,783
Why did you go away?

442
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:36,658
I haven't been able to forget you.

443
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:39,783
I haven't forgotten.

444
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:44,181
Mr Iyengar!
- News reporter! Come here!

445
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:47,191
Come here!
- I knew you'd go crazy

446
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,742
and you've indeed gone crazy.

447
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:55,385
I was printing, composing
and developing all night.

448
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:58,408
I kept on walking back and forth.

449
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:02,806
I didn't have liquor,
didn't shave and didn't even eat.

450
00:41:03,034 --> 00:41:05,075
You didn't eat.
- No!

451
00:41:05,491 --> 00:41:08,116
Would you like to?
- If you offer with love.

452
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:11,241
I'll feed you with great love.
Have a seat.

453
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,283
Wow!
Hot food!

454
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:16,416
Did all your papers sell?

455
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:20,075
There are a few left.
- Oh no!

456
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:24,116
Whose picture did you publish
in our newspaper?

457
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:25,258
That girl's.

458
00:41:25,408 --> 00:41:27,992
And her dad's photo?
- I'll do it!

459
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:31,985
I'm the father of that girl.
Print my picture!

460
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:35,025
Congratulations!
You're a grandpa of 7 kids!

461
00:41:35,115 --> 00:41:36,158
Shut up!

462
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:40,408
That girl is unmarried!
How can she have kids?

463
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,700
You've created a problem,
you broke her engagement.

464
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:47,783
Now eat this paper up!

465
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:49,533
Eat this.

466
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:51,498
How can I eat paper?

467
00:41:51,658 --> 00:41:55,526
I'll add salt and spices to it.

468
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:58,860
I'll pour curry on it.
Here!

469
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,700
I'll wash my hands.
- Sit!

470
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,950
Eat.

471
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:04,825
Eat it up!

472
00:42:05,575 --> 00:42:08,825
I've heard that each grain is
destined to be in someone's name.

473
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:12,441
It seems the one
who has the paper, consumes it.

474
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,199
Have it!
- Eat!

475
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,366
Eat! - Curry and paper!
Never heard of it.

476
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,867
Eat!
It's very tasty!

477
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:26,528
I can't gulp it.
- You surely can!

478
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,235
Ate it?

479
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:31,325
He ate it! Now eat this.
- Gulped it?

480
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:34,079
It'll go down fast!
Eat!

481
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:38,777
Again!

482
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:42,451
Kick him and throw him out!

483
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:44,932
I might as well eat well.

484
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:50,115
Hurry up! Get out!
- Don't hit me! Let me eat!

485
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:57,827
Iqbal!
- Yes, uncle!

486
00:42:57,998 --> 00:42:59,861
Look at the beautiful Eid moon.

487
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:09,247
Happy Eid!

488
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,831
I'll first greet mom on Eid.

489
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:19,372
Mom, happy Eid.

490
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:25,636
One should see an auspicious face

491
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:27,390
after seeing the Eid moon.

492
00:43:28,998 --> 00:43:32,084
For me,

493
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:36,624
you come after God.

494
00:43:37,593 --> 00:43:39,812
Only you.

495
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:45,678
But you didn't fulfil
even a single wish of mine.

496
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:49,428
On every Eid,

497
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:55,100
mothers get new clothes stitched,

498
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,706
prepare sweets

499
00:43:57,121 --> 00:43:59,247
and hug their children.

500
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:01,414
But...

501
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:06,289
But you never blessed me,

502
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:08,748
for a longer life.

503
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,456
That all my wishes are fulfilled.

504
00:44:11,737 --> 00:44:12,831
You never did.

505
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:15,789
Well,

506
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:21,164
may God keep you in good health,
wherever you are.

507
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,914
Enough!

508
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:36,606
Stop it!

509
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:44,831
Goga.
- Yes.

510
00:44:45,581 --> 00:44:48,520
When did you last give her a shock?
- 15 days back.

511
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,372
I told you
to give her shock treatment daily!

512
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:55,783
I'm sorry.

513
00:44:55,873 --> 00:44:58,205
If she gains her memory back,
I'll kill you!

514
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,914
She should forget her past!

515
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:05,331
Since you've brought her,
she's in the same condition.

516
00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:07,539
She's like a moving dead body,

517
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:11,331
whom you've kept alive.

518
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:13,873
Why don't you kill her?
- No!

519
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:18,164
She is an emblem of my victory,

520
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,331
whom I've brought home like a prey,
just to decorate my house.

521
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:24,456
And...

522
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:26,122
This is her punishment.

523
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:28,247
Sir, she's all right!
- Out!

524
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:37,040
Salma!

525
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:42,664
You mustn't think a lot.

526
00:45:43,105 --> 00:45:45,121
The doctor said
that it's bad for your health.

527
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:48,998
Here's a letter from your son
from India.

528
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:50,955
Here.

529
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:54,309
He wrote that he'll soon
get a job as a reporter.

530
00:45:55,178 --> 00:45:58,643
And that
he'll quit drinking forever.

531
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:17,324
"I am not a drinker."

532
00:46:17,414 --> 00:46:21,873
"I drink to keep worries away."

533
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:27,879
"I am not a drinker."

534
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,706
"I drink to keep worries away."

535
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:38,831
"To keep away your memories."

536
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:43,824
"To keep away your memories."

537
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:48,331
"I drink to keep worries away."

538
00:46:49,247 --> 00:46:54,414
"I am not a drinker."

539
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:59,040
"I drink to keep worries away."

540
00:46:59,956 --> 00:47:05,040
"To keep away your memories."

541
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:10,205
"To keep away your memories."

542
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:14,831
"I drink to keep worries away."

543
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:20,699
"I am not a drinker."

544
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:25,409
"I drink to keep worries away."

545
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,247
Sunny!

546
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:28,121
"I lost the book,"

547
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:34,122
"to which this tale belongs."

548
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:38,622
"I lost the book,"

549
00:48:39,456 --> 00:48:44,414
"to which this tale belongs."

550
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:49,456
"One part is with me"

551
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:55,121
"and one part is with you."

552
00:48:55,211 --> 00:49:04,456
"How do I join these hearts?"

553
00:49:05,414 --> 00:49:10,706
"I am not a drinker."

554
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:14,998
"I drink to keep worries away."

555
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:45,289
"If we could have met,"

556
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:50,372
"water would also
have caught fire."

557
00:49:50,998 --> 00:49:55,581
"If we could have met,"

558
00:49:56,164 --> 00:50:01,040
"water would also
have caught fire."

559
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:06,539
"The friendship of childhood,"

560
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:11,414
"blossoms during youth."

561
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:16,789
"It has turned into a need."

562
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:22,247
"It has turned into a need."

563
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:26,581
"A need for this friendship."

564
00:50:27,622 --> 00:50:32,414
"I am not a drinker."

565
00:50:32,673 --> 00:50:36,998
"I drink to keep worries away."

566
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:43,121
"I am not a drinker."

567
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:47,706
"I drink to keep worries away."

568
00:50:57,289 --> 00:50:58,269
Police.

569
00:51:00,331 --> 00:51:02,247
The police will capture me.

570
00:51:05,664 --> 00:51:06,589
You!

571
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,943
The police are after me!
Hide me somewhere.

572
00:51:10,497 --> 00:51:11,423
Hide you?

573
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:14,239
I published your photo
and your dad fired me!

574
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:18,706
If I hide you,
the police will arrest me.

575
00:51:18,796 --> 00:51:22,081
You lost the job because of me.
- Yes!

576
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:23,831
Look at this!

577
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:26,882
MISSING!

578
00:51:27,664 --> 00:51:28,831
Rs. 5000!

579
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:31,610
Take me home
and you'll be rewarded Rs. 5000.

580
00:51:31,831 --> 00:51:33,252
We'll split the money.

581
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:36,205
I'll run away again.
You take me home!

582
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:38,873
Half will be yours and half, mine.
Next week...

583
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:40,574
Sir!

584
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,247
Here is your reward.

585
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:44,331
Good bye! See you again!
- Thank you!

586
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:46,620
Hey man!

587
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:48,122
Give my share!

588
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:51,991
You caught me,
I won't spare you!

589
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:55,456
I'll get you!
- Shut her in the room!

590
00:51:56,741 --> 00:51:58,481
'MISSING MS DEEPA IYENGAR'

591
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:05,664
She's 5 feet 2 inches tall
and belongs to an Iyengar family.

592
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,247
Stand straight!

593
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,081
5 feet 2 inches.

594
00:52:10,723 --> 00:52:14,247
She has a wheatish complexion
and her name is Deepa.

595
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:19,411
Don't you know that Tamilians
are great? - Hurry up.

596
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:24,402
This time they're going to give
a special reward to a Tamilian.

597
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:25,438
Oh!

598
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,552
It takes 5 minutes to become
a Punjabi, Gujarati or Marathi.

599
00:52:28,642 --> 00:52:31,581
It takes time
to become a Tamilian.

600
00:52:31,706 --> 00:52:34,372
I'll go there and say,
'Mr Iyengar, hello!'

601
00:52:34,497 --> 00:52:37,366
I risked my life
to save your daughter!

602
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:39,436
I can win Rs. 5000!

603
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:42,576
'I belong to the brave

604
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:45,703
'Kattaboman's royal family.'

605
00:52:45,873 --> 00:52:48,748
'I fought exactly like him
with the sword.'

606
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:53,497
Oh! So, you are the missing girl!
- That is not me.

607
00:52:53,622 --> 00:52:55,873
Come on!
- No!

608
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,257
Sit!
- Save me!

609
00:52:58,414 --> 00:52:59,783
Where are you?

610
00:52:59,873 --> 00:53:04,799
Save me!
- Where are you taking the girl?

611
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:06,873
Hey tall guy!

612
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,456
What, shorty?

613
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:11,804
Why are you taking her?
- For a reward.

614
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:16,247
I told her dad
that I'm bringing his daughter.

615
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,409
Tell him that a tall guy
is taking her home.

616
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,497
Okay.
Tall guy!

617
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:30,115
"Hey tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

618
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:35,205
"Hey tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

619
00:53:35,831 --> 00:53:40,247
"Don't block my path."

620
00:53:40,414 --> 00:53:44,831
"Don't block my path."

621
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:52,497
"Don't touch this girl."

622
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:57,264
"Hey shorty."
- "Speak tall man."

623
00:53:57,354 --> 00:54:02,081
"Hey shorty."
- "Speak tall man."

624
00:54:02,831 --> 00:54:07,205
"Don't block my path."

625
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:11,664
"Don't block my path."

626
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:19,665
"Don't touch this girl."

627
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:24,164
"Hey shorty."
- "Speak tall man."

628
00:54:24,289 --> 00:54:29,121
"You tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

629
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:38,957
Yeah, boy!

630
00:54:59,094 --> 00:55:03,372
"I saw her first."

631
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,831
"I found her first."

632
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:12,289
"I saw her first."

633
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:16,956
"I found her first."

634
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:22,040
"But she prefers me."

635
00:55:22,164 --> 00:55:27,997
"It's my reward."

636
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:32,998
"You tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

637
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:38,247
"Don't try to make me angry."

638
00:55:38,337 --> 00:55:45,998
"Don't touch this girl."

639
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:51,456
"You tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

640
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,168
Oh, boy!

641
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:32,366
'Tam dhitam...' 'Tam Dhitam...'
Oh, boy! -Go!

642
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:36,732
"I have come
to Bombay from Madras".

643
00:56:36,914 --> 00:56:41,247
"So you became tall on the way."

644
00:56:41,372 --> 00:56:45,610
"You are trying to fly high
though you are so short."

645
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:51,374
"Height doesn't make
any difference".

646
00:56:51,464 --> 00:56:56,748
"You tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

647
00:56:57,018 --> 00:57:01,331
"Don't boast about your height."

648
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:09,074
"Don't touch this girl."

649
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:14,289
"You tall man."
- "Speak shorty."

650
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:58,634
"I have brought her."

651
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:03,491
"Her father will decide that."

652
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:06,998
"I have brought her."

653
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:12,121
"Her father will decide that."

654
00:58:12,211 --> 00:58:16,605
"We should be
sharing the reward."

655
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:20,172
"We should
split the money equally."

656
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:22,635
Equally?
- Our reward.

657
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:27,122
I'm fed up with this girl.
She keeps running away!

658
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:31,491
We have no money.
One of you marry her as a reward!

659
00:58:31,581 --> 00:58:33,950
Only one! C'mon!
- C'mon!

660
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,463
"You tall man."
- Speak shorty."

661
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:44,031
"This girl
is not a gold mine at all."

662
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:51,449
"Don't touch this girl."

663
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:56,121
"Don't touch this girl."
- "Don't touch this girl."

664
00:58:56,247 --> 00:58:58,241
"Shorty!"
- "Tall man!"

665
00:58:58,414 --> 00:59:00,282
"Shorty!"
- "Tall man!"

666
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:02,332
"Shorty!"
- "Tall man!"

667
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,083
"Shorty!"
- "Tall man!"

668
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:26,247
Hello!
- Yes?

669
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:28,629
Could I meet Mr. Chopra?

670
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:31,539
He doesn't work here anymore.
The owner has changed.

671
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:35,831
But they're giving us houses today.

672
00:59:35,956 --> 00:59:36,867
You can go.

673
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,016
C'mon!
Let's go.

674
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:43,456
Stand in one place!

675
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,542
Hello, sir.

676
00:59:48,477 --> 00:59:49,291
You?

677
00:59:49,456 --> 00:59:51,956
I'm the owner.
What are you doing here?

678
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:57,581
The map lying in front of you
shows where our houses stand.

679
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,831
Give us the charge of those houses.

680
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,288
Have you paid the advance?
- Yes! Here is the receipt.

681
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:08,372
Where is the balance?

682
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:13,574
Here. You promised us
to give houses at Rs. 5000.

683
01:00:13,664 --> 01:00:15,873
Houses for Rs. 5000!
Nonsense!

684
01:00:16,121 --> 01:00:17,914
Vicky?
- Yes, dad?

685
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:23,366
Where are the contract papers?
- Here.

686
01:00:23,456 --> 01:00:24,414
Show them.

687
01:00:24,748 --> 01:00:26,414
Houses for Rs. 5000.

688
01:00:26,622 --> 01:00:31,247
Advance of Rs. 1000 and Rs. 49,000
before buying the houses.

689
01:00:31,372 --> 01:00:32,824
49,000?

690
01:00:32,914 --> 01:00:36,331
Rs. 1000 less than Rs. 50,000.
Read this!

691
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:40,788
(Stamp Paper)

692
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,153
No... No, no!

693
01:00:42,662 --> 01:00:44,789
This is a lie, it's injustice.

694
01:00:44,956 --> 01:00:50,616
We had agreed on Rs. 5000!
You added a zero.

695
01:00:50,706 --> 01:00:52,828
What do you mean?

696
01:00:52,998 --> 01:00:55,622
You can't get
doors and windows with Rs. 5000.

697
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:58,120
Get the money and then speak!
Get out!

698
01:00:59,081 --> 01:01:01,115
Get him out!
Throw him out!

699
01:01:01,205 --> 01:01:03,503
This isn't right!

700
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:07,461
Be ready to face the consequences!

701
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,664
We'll surely voice this out.
- Out!

702
01:01:10,456 --> 01:01:12,608
He spoke of Rs. 50,000!

703
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,998
Let's go to Iqbal!

704
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:19,040
See how we've taken
a hold of her property.

705
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:22,289
Now the question of
Julie's remaining property...

706
01:01:22,916 --> 01:01:24,331
I remember...

707
01:01:24,754 --> 01:01:26,372
Did you speak to her
about marriage?

708
01:01:27,164 --> 01:01:28,710
Yes, daddy.
- What did she say?

709
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:30,831
She declined.

710
01:01:31,081 --> 01:01:32,372
Declined?

711
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:38,884
Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.

712
01:01:40,414 --> 01:01:42,121
We'll have to make her agree,

713
01:01:43,331 --> 01:01:46,164
so that we'll have
half of the share in her property.

714
01:01:46,664 --> 01:01:47,664
How?

715
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,414
Daddy, have water.

716
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:53,456
What happened, uncle?

717
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,313
Julie, good you're here.

718
01:01:56,403 --> 01:01:59,497
Dad had a heart attack.
I'll call a doctor.

719
01:02:00,459 --> 01:02:02,664
Uncle!

720
01:02:05,465 --> 01:02:06,414
Uncle!

721
01:02:08,081 --> 01:02:12,914
My child, I wanted to talk to you.
Good that you came.

722
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:16,873
Your father
had promised me something.

723
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:19,587
Will you fulfil it?
- Yes.

724
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:22,926
Please marry him.

725
01:02:23,998 --> 01:02:25,121
That's impossible.

726
01:02:26,436 --> 01:02:31,914
I want to avenge
my father's death.

727
01:02:32,289 --> 01:02:34,950
Avenging your dad's death
is your wish.

728
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,966
But your marriage

729
01:02:39,164 --> 01:02:41,914
was your dad's wish.

730
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:45,998
Uncle, why don't you understand?

731
01:02:46,873 --> 01:02:48,272
I can't get married!

732
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:51,706
Why don't you get engaged?
- Uncle!

733
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,129
Let me die in peace.

734
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:59,789
I raised you like my daughter
since you were 5 years old.

735
01:03:00,164 --> 01:03:04,833
With the hope that you would
fulfil my last wish. - Uncle!

736
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:09,873
Okay.

737
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:11,822
Bless you!

738
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:15,625
I will die happy,
seeing my daughter-in-law.

739
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:18,414
Father, doctor is here.
- Send him back.

740
01:03:18,581 --> 01:03:20,866
Now that you're getting engaged,
I feel perfectly fine.

741
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,003
Julie agreed to get engaged.

742
01:03:23,164 --> 01:03:24,956
Really, Julie?

743
01:03:25,956 --> 01:03:29,164
Print cards!
Invite people for the engagement.

744
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:33,914
Your engagement has been fixed
for the 2nd of next month.

745
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:40,062
Where is the department of printing
wedding and engagement cards?

746
01:03:44,806 --> 01:03:46,353
Hey, you!

747
01:03:48,553 --> 01:03:50,730
Hello, sir!
- Interrupting my drinking!

748
01:03:52,243 --> 01:03:54,315
Hey, shorty!
- Tall guy!

749
01:03:54,405 --> 01:03:57,344
Here for the reward?
- No! I'm not here for the reward.

750
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:03,763
Is the engagement card of
Mr Vicky's son being printed here?

751
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:06,337
Yes!
Do I print them for you too?

752
01:04:06,571 --> 01:04:09,433
Yes, but not a card!

753
01:04:09,523 --> 01:04:10,609
Listen...

754
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:12,769
What's the date
printed on the card?

755
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:15,271
2nd.
- That's it.

756
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,670
Take with this hand
and return with that hand.

757
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,847
What?

758
01:04:23,062 --> 01:04:24,164
Excuse me!

759
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,604
Yes?

760
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,072
Who are you?

761
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,976
Didn't you recognize me?
- No.

762
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:35,284
Didn't you recognize
the famous reporter of Rigby?

763
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:36,889
My card?

764
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:38,578
Move it!
- Okay, sir.

765
01:04:38,668 --> 01:04:42,488
I want to print your picture on
the front page and show the world!

766
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:43,592
Bad shot!

767
01:04:43,862 --> 01:04:45,140
Good try!

768
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:49,892
I'll write that
you're a generous person.

769
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,284
Till now, rich people invite
only the rich for the parties,

770
01:04:54,374 --> 01:04:59,622
but you will be the first person to
invite the poor, that too, porters.

771
01:04:59,922 --> 01:05:01,501
Porters?
- Nonsense!

772
01:05:02,452 --> 01:05:04,236
Porters at our party?

773
01:05:04,326 --> 01:05:07,056
The porters who insulted you.

774
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:09,724
Don't you believe this?
Have a look.

775
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:35,919
What do you think of the fun
these porters are having?

776
01:05:36,303 --> 01:05:37,287
Shut up!

777
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,812
What are you up to?

778
01:05:51,927 --> 01:05:53,359
Who sent you inside?

779
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,563
That's strange! First, you invite us
and then you forget.

780
01:05:56,749 --> 01:06:01,749
We've got an invitation card
for the engagement.

781
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,749
Look.
- What misbehaviour is this?

782
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,081
Drive them out!
Michael!

783
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:08,733
You want Michael?

784
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:11,749
There's Michael and party.

785
01:06:12,124 --> 01:06:14,917
Excuse me.
They're your guests.

786
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:17,285
You invite them
and then drive them out?

787
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,624
This isn't good.

788
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,026
Bad publicity.

789
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:24,833
Vicky, call the other people
and ask why they aren't here.

790
01:06:26,658 --> 01:06:28,749
One pose please.
- Of course.

791
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:30,770
Put your arm around him.
- Why not?

792
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:34,624
Smile please.

793
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,542
Hello.
- Hello, Uncle Zafar, I'm Vicky.

794
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:49,375
Vicky, I have an invitation
to your engagement.

795
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,835
What happened?
- What?

796
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:52,749
Today is the 2nd, my engagement.

797
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:54,707
Today?
- Today's the 2nd.

798
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:55,874
'Engagement ceremony
of Shri Vicky with Julie.'

799
01:06:55,964 --> 01:06:58,958
The date printed is the 20th.
- How did it change?

800
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,521
Like 5 changes to 50.

801
01:07:03,231 --> 01:07:06,707
You taught this to us
and we used it on you.

802
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:10,833
So, you did this?
- Yes.

803
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:14,797
Thank you.

804
01:07:14,941 --> 01:07:17,999
We did this, thanks to you.

805
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:23,707
Till you don't give us houses,
we'll stay in your house.

806
01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:26,213
We'll consider it our own.

807
01:07:26,303 --> 01:07:27,879
What do you say?
- Yes!

808
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:30,999
Excuse me, could you
throw some light on this?

809
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:33,583
Is this your way to get the houses?

810
01:07:33,934 --> 01:07:34,916
Sir,

811
01:07:35,431 --> 01:07:39,041
you took our money in your way,
we'll get the houses, our way.

812
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:42,083
You want houses, right?
- Yes.

813
01:07:42,223 --> 01:07:43,293
You'll get them.

814
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:49,583
Excuse me!

815
01:07:50,353 --> 01:07:54,041
They have a right to the houses
and you've grown pale.

816
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,999
Do you want to say something?

817
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,624
They'll get the houses
that they have a right on. - I see.

818
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:19,932
You want a house, right?

819
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,224
Here.

820
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,307
Happy?

821
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:29,141
What happened?
Are they small?

822
01:08:32,749 --> 01:08:35,099
It's bigger than your heart.

823
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:38,455
We'll provide what's necessary

824
01:08:39,763 --> 01:08:44,587
for rich people like
you in this house.

825
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,932
Move away!

826
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:53,766
What are you doing?

827
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,890
I'm trying to decrease the size
of this chandelier,

828
01:08:57,558 --> 01:09:00,766
or it won't fit in this house.

829
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:02,474
Iqbal.
- Yes!

830
01:09:02,564 --> 01:09:06,210
Could you throw some light
on the chandeliers and the houses?

831
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:09,031
I'm about to throw many things.

832
01:09:09,572 --> 01:09:10,717
Wait and watch.

833
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:13,391
Do you know how costly that was?
- Excuse me!

834
01:09:13,779 --> 01:09:16,635
What do you think about the
chandelier in pieces? - Shut up!

835
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:17,502
I will.

836
01:09:17,641 --> 01:09:19,447
Iqbal...
- What?

837
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:21,684
I use a plate as a mirror.

838
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,994
You want a mirror?
You'll get it.

839
01:09:32,605 --> 01:09:34,224
I would've photographed it,
had I known.

840
01:09:34,582 --> 01:09:36,766
Binbal?
- Yes, Iqbal.

841
01:09:37,391 --> 01:09:41,474
Can you see yourself?
- Yes. It's great.

842
01:09:41,613 --> 01:09:42,766
Excuse me!

843
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:46,059
It's unlucky for a mirror
to break during an engagement.

844
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,057
What do you think about it?

845
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:54,344
A clock is necessary
for us to reach on time. - Yes!

846
01:09:54,516 --> 01:09:57,294
Just a moment!
Smile!

847
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:00,425
Now break it.
- There we go!

848
01:10:03,683 --> 01:10:05,321
Uncle!
- Yes!

849
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:10,141
Friends, take your share.

850
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:14,641
Your misbehaviour...
- This pendulum moves,

851
01:10:14,932 --> 01:10:19,599
it keeps moving.
This time belongs to us now. - I...

852
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:22,951
What's your opinion
about this moving pendulum?

853
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,103
Shut up!

854
01:10:24,193 --> 01:10:25,849
Vicky, call the police!

855
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:28,849
Wait a minute!

856
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,349
Now break it!

857
01:10:33,931 --> 01:10:34,932
Hello!

858
01:10:37,141 --> 01:10:40,433
I want a fan.
- I want it.

859
01:10:44,659 --> 01:10:45,849
Hold it!

860
01:10:47,307 --> 01:10:49,063
Thank you. Your turn.

861
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,278
'Yeah, so what was I saying?'

862
01:10:57,312 --> 01:10:59,184
What's all this?

863
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:00,849
Who are these people?

864
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,890
So you've reached here too.

865
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:07,806
We're guests.
We received the invitation cards.

866
01:11:07,932 --> 01:11:11,141
Uncle Ramu, did you get everything
or is there anything left?

867
01:11:11,266 --> 01:11:13,222
He only wants a wife now.

868
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:14,683
A wife?

869
01:11:15,806 --> 01:11:17,474
A wife!
- Let go!

870
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:18,759
Uncle.

871
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:21,141
Look at yourself and me.

872
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:22,641
Does this girl suit you?

873
01:11:23,711 --> 01:11:26,932
I'm keeping her for me.

874
01:11:27,022 --> 01:11:30,759
He's holding my hand
and you aren't doing anything.

875
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:33,307
He's come with so many men.

876
01:11:33,849 --> 01:11:36,141
I would've dealt with him
if he was alone.

877
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,755
Consider me alone.

878
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:43,558
I need to settle
a few matters with you.

879
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,849
Do I settle them now?
- Sure.

880
01:11:46,532 --> 01:11:47,683
Leave him.

881
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:46,228
In a minute this iron
will pierce your chest!

882
01:12:46,384 --> 01:12:49,039
We are workers and
our chest is an iron wall!

883
01:12:49,503 --> 01:12:51,138
And these are our tools.

884
01:12:51,783 --> 01:12:55,473
They help us sustain our livelihood
and can destroy you as well.

885
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,209
Hey, excuse me. Hello!

886
01:14:05,593 --> 01:14:07,581
Smile, smile smile.
- No!

887
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:14,817
Your body is sinking
because of the eagle's weight.

888
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:16,680
Do you have anything to say?

889
01:14:17,989 --> 01:14:20,736
Oh I forgot.
You can't speak.

890
01:14:20,826 --> 01:14:23,840
Cheers for Iqbal!

891
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,256
What are you doing?
- C'mon!

892
01:14:25,346 --> 01:14:28,470
Just a moment Iqbal, smile!
- Leave me.

893
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:31,846
Uncle, call the police.
- What are you doing?

894
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:33,346
Uncle, call the police.

895
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:37,478
She will stay with us
till we get our homes.

896
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,898
Any comments? I'll be back
in a while. Let's go guys! -Uncle!

897
01:14:41,451 --> 01:14:42,848
Uncle! Uncle, call the police.

898
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:47,435
So, these porters defeated
and embarrased you...

899
01:14:47,697 --> 01:14:49,107
What is your opinion on this?

900
01:14:49,623 --> 01:14:50,786
Shut up!

901
01:14:50,876 --> 01:14:52,533
You shut up!

902
01:14:56,705 --> 01:15:00,538
Leave me! I said leave me!
- Don't move your legs.

903
01:15:00,628 --> 01:15:03,903
Shut up and sit here.

904
01:15:04,081 --> 01:15:08,442
Sit! Lie down!

905
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:15,893
I'm warning you, let me go!
I'll send you to jail.

906
01:15:15,983 --> 01:15:19,106
I'll handcuff you now.

907
01:15:19,196 --> 01:15:23,792
Next I'll send your partner
to jail.

908
01:15:23,882 --> 01:15:25,583
Leave me!
- Shut up!

909
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:32,083
Or I'll break you like
I broke your house at the party.

910
01:15:33,131 --> 01:15:34,953
Big talks.

911
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:37,375
Will you have food?
- No.

912
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:40,127
Don't eat.
I'm telling you to sing.

913
01:15:49,363 --> 01:15:52,516
Water is leaking!

914
01:15:52,606 --> 01:15:58,554
Look ma'am, you get water through
taps, we get it from the roof.

915
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:01,785
I can't cook here now.

'Break it and put it in the pan.'

970
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,292
Break it...

971
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,159
'Now do a headstand.'

972
01:19:14,444 --> 01:19:18,827
'A headstand. Slowly!'
- Headstand.

973
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:21,873
Okay.
- Slowly, slowly...

974
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,042
'Look at the omelette cooking.'

975
01:19:26,132 --> 01:19:27,459
Madam, can you see it?

976
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:28,792
How is it?

977
01:19:31,177 --> 01:19:32,792
Great!

978
01:19:32,882 --> 01:19:37,417
It's good, right? After so much
hard work it has to be good!

979
01:19:38,109 --> 01:19:40,708
'Keep your legs down.'

980
01:19:41,131 --> 01:19:46,417
'Now slowly stand up.
Slowly.'

981
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:49,244
'Be seated'
- Again!

982
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:53,804
'and place your right leg

983
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,570
on your neck.'

984
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,467
Right leg.
- 'Slowly.'

985
01:19:57,666 --> 01:20:00,750
'Don't do it in a hurry.'

986
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:05,334
'Place your right leg
on your neck.'

987
01:20:05,583 --> 01:20:07,000
Oh God!

988
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:10,792
The spices used in the omelette
are wonderful. - What's happening?

989
01:20:11,249 --> 01:20:15,846
I'm stuck! I'm locked!

990
01:20:16,062 --> 01:20:19,792
Let me go!

991
01:20:21,311 --> 01:20:25,250
The keys!
No!

992
01:20:26,502 --> 01:20:31,107
Madam, please unlock me too.

993
01:20:32,232 --> 01:20:33,417
Please!

994
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:36,000
Oh, God!

995
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:41,792
Sir, your neck is trapped
with your legs. - Yes.

996
01:20:41,986 --> 01:20:44,792
What is your opinion on this?
- Very bad.

997
01:20:45,332 --> 01:20:46,397
Hey! Hey!

998
01:20:46,487 --> 01:20:48,167
Thank you.
- Okay.

999
01:20:48,257 --> 01:20:52,042
Please help me!
Help!

1000
01:20:52,568 --> 01:20:55,569
Help!
Help!

1001
01:20:56,301 --> 01:20:58,375
Allahrakha...

1002
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:01,471
Don't try to run away!

1003
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:05,243
Or Allahrakha
will gouge your eyes out!

1004
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:12,875
Come here and help me
get rid of this situation.

1005
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:15,000
Come!

1006
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:18,417
My neck!

1007
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:24,042
My body is aching!

1008
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:26,501
'Your French omelette is ready.'

1009
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:31,459
'Eat it and...'
- I'll show it! I'll hit it!

1010
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:34,666
Hey girl!
Hold this!

1011
01:21:36,881 --> 01:21:41,074
I'm going to the railway station.

1012
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,906
When I return,

1013
01:21:42,996 --> 01:21:47,224
keep the French omelette ready.

1014
01:21:47,314 --> 01:21:48,459
Understood?!

1015
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:55,750
Keep a watch on her, Allahrakha.

1016
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:23,250
Don't be afraid, dear.

1017
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,958
Whenever the train passes,
the houses of the poor shake.

1018
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:30,542
I'm returning
from a pilgrimage to Shirdi.

1019
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,833
I heard that
Iqbal brought you here forcefully.

1020
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,375
The donkey!

1021
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:39,750
No decision
can be taken in a hurry.

1022
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,375
You can go.

1023
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,334
It...
- Shut up.

1024
01:23:00,118 --> 01:23:02,083
You have troubled me a lot.

1025
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:05,334
I won't spare you.

1026
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:12,292
You wanted
a French omelette, right?

1027
01:23:12,792 --> 01:23:15,417
Why are you killing
a dead person?

1028
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,583
He wished to have
a French omelette made by you.

1029
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:24,250
When he was
walking towards the station,

1030
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,792
the train broke him
into little pieces.

1031
01:23:29,949 --> 01:23:33,666
Every piece
was yelling out your name.

1032
01:23:37,391 --> 01:23:39,941
'IQBAL COOLIE MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT'
- Why did you leave us like this, Iqbal?

1033
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,520
But there was no such news
in today's paper.

1034
01:23:43,797 --> 01:23:48,401
No one prints news
of a poor person like him.

1035
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:53,603
If a person like your uncle had
died, they would've printed it.

1036
01:23:54,213 --> 01:23:56,667
If you don't believe me,
check for yourself.

1037
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:59,396
Porters have erected a statue
in his memory at Rani Baug.

1038
01:24:00,773 --> 01:24:02,106
He died for you.

1039
01:24:02,481 --> 01:24:05,356
So you can express your love...
- What?

1040
01:24:05,648 --> 01:24:08,481
Tell his statue
what you feel for him.

1041
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:12,190
So that at least his statue
will rest in peace.

1042
01:24:15,648 --> 01:24:21,105
I can't stand to know of the death
of such a great young man.

1043
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:28,710
I shiver with fear
when I think of this.

1044
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:33,610
Will you come?

1045
01:24:34,231 --> 01:24:35,899
Iqbal!

1046
01:24:37,079 --> 01:24:38,356
'What are you thinking about?'

1047
01:24:38,559 --> 01:24:41,398
'If you have feelings for him, go.'

1048
01:24:41,745 --> 01:24:43,190
'If you don't, don't go.'

1049
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,339
How long
should I hold you like this?

1050
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:51,132
Hold me until the girl comes.

1051
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,365
Here she is!
Jump!

1052
01:24:59,506 --> 01:25:00,769
Jump!
- Hold this.

1053
01:25:00,859 --> 01:25:03,381
Umbrella!

1054
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:22,132
She's also carrying two candles.

1055
01:25:22,222 --> 01:25:25,298
Candles? For whom?

1056
01:25:25,769 --> 01:25:27,465
Only she knows.

1057
01:25:32,222 --> 01:25:33,414
Come.

1058
01:25:48,103 --> 01:25:50,255
The craftsman has created
such a lovely statue.

1059
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:53,158
Feels like he will speak any time.

1060
01:25:53,339 --> 01:25:57,928
He's unable to speak right now,
as it's just a statue.

1061
01:26:01,762 --> 01:26:06,631
I wish you had waited
for a few days.

1062
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:12,798
We could've got to know
each other better.

1063
01:26:16,118 --> 01:26:18,298
The moment I saw you
on the railway station,

1064
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:20,965
my heart started beating.

1065
01:26:21,214 --> 01:26:22,298
What happened?
- What?

1066
01:26:23,574 --> 01:26:27,640
What happened?
No need to be shy.

1067
01:26:28,339 --> 01:26:33,247
I thought you would reach my home
in my search.

1068
01:26:33,423 --> 01:26:35,007
I didn't know the address.
- What?

1069
01:26:35,465 --> 01:26:38,381
He didn't have the address.
How could he reach your place?

1070
01:26:39,298 --> 01:26:40,798
You troubled me a lot.

1071
01:26:41,339 --> 01:26:44,381
You carried me away like luggage
in front of many people.

1072
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:50,174
I liked that attitude,
your bravery.

1073
01:26:50,465 --> 01:26:51,715
You should've said that before.

1074
01:26:52,548 --> 01:26:54,715
You should've said it before.

1075
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:57,423
Why are you interrupting?
- I am not!

1076
01:26:57,513 --> 01:27:00,339
I cried a lot
seeing your photo in the newspaper

1077
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,838
and I didn't know
whether it was sympathy or love.

1078
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:07,899
They say that love can make

1079
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,423
a dead person alive with its power,

1080
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:14,833
I wish my love had that power.

1081
01:27:14,923 --> 01:27:16,798
See, here I turn alive!

1082
01:27:22,912 --> 01:27:26,048
Are you alive?

1083
01:27:27,197 --> 01:27:29,512
Was it an act?
- It wasn't an act.

1084
01:27:29,816 --> 01:27:32,950
The power of your love did this.
- Who said I love you?

1085
01:27:33,132 --> 01:27:36,881
When I was a statue,
you loved me.

1086
01:27:37,048 --> 01:27:39,673
As I turned alive,
you started hating me.

1087
01:27:39,763 --> 01:27:41,296
I don't care about you!

1088
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:44,339
I don't have any feelings for you.
You're a cheap person!

1089
01:27:47,092 --> 01:27:48,184
She's gone.

1090
01:27:49,084 --> 01:27:50,465
Hey, Sunny!

1091
01:27:51,715 --> 01:27:53,798
Hey, Sunny...

1092
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:57,339
Where have you escaped?

1093
01:27:57,843 --> 01:28:02,090
The train has lost its track!

1094
01:28:20,797 --> 01:28:21,725
You?

1095
01:28:25,726 --> 01:28:28,798
Don't keep staring.
Clear the water.

1096
01:28:32,381 --> 01:28:33,339
You?

1097
01:28:35,095 --> 01:28:37,798
What are you doing?

1098
01:28:38,048 --> 01:28:40,756
Can't you see?
I'm clearing the water.

1099
01:28:41,118 --> 01:28:43,255
How will I cook
the special omelette?

1100
01:28:44,298 --> 01:28:47,840
What are you doing here
at this hour?

1101
01:28:48,298 --> 01:28:49,923
I'm here of my own will.

1102
01:28:50,298 --> 01:28:52,255
I've also decided that,

1103
01:28:52,548 --> 01:28:57,298
I won't move
until the porters get their houses.

1104
01:28:58,050 --> 01:29:00,015
Hey, hey, hey!

1105
01:29:01,798 --> 01:29:06,298
Such heavy rainfall...

1106
01:29:08,423 --> 01:29:11,631
Water-logging...

1107
01:29:12,174 --> 01:29:15,324
Are you here

1108
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,440
to give us the houses?

1109
01:29:19,923 --> 01:29:22,381
No, I'm here

1110
01:29:24,048 --> 01:29:25,174
to create my own home.

1111
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:27,923
Oh Lord.

1112
01:29:29,048 --> 01:29:32,660
"Allahrakha!"

1113
01:29:36,882 --> 01:29:40,452
"Allahrakha!"

1114
01:30:06,215 --> 01:30:12,091
"Two souls
are heartily celebrating."

1115
01:30:13,499 --> 01:30:17,840
"Two souls
are heartily celebrating."

1116
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:21,376
"It's neither your mistake,
nor mine."

1117
01:30:21,548 --> 01:30:25,255
"Neither did you see a signal,
nor did I."

1118
01:30:25,345 --> 01:30:29,016
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1119
01:30:29,106 --> 01:30:33,572
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1120
01:30:35,289 --> 01:30:39,298
"Two souls
are heartily celebrating."

1121
01:30:39,388 --> 01:30:43,017
"It's neither your mistake,
nor mine."

1122
01:30:43,174 --> 01:30:46,715
"Neither did you see a signal,
nor did I."

1123
01:30:46,805 --> 01:30:50,631
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1124
01:30:50,721 --> 01:30:52,590
"It led to an accident..."

1125
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:59,255
"We made an agreement
and it was permanent, oh God!"

1126
01:31:22,773 --> 01:31:28,856
"Two crazy people,
we didn't look back or forward."

1127
01:31:28,946 --> 01:31:33,381
"We placed the train of our heart
on the track."

1128
01:31:36,565 --> 01:31:42,626
"Two crazy people,
we didn't look back or forward."

1129
01:31:42,716 --> 01:31:46,882
"We placed the train of our heart
on the track."

1130
01:31:48,104 --> 01:31:51,675
"Neither did you see the signal,
nor did I see the flag."

1131
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:55,676
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1132
01:31:55,766 --> 01:31:57,671
"It led to an accident..."

1133
01:31:57,761 --> 01:32:04,129
"We made an agreement
and it was permanent, oh God!"

1134
01:32:12,013 --> 01:32:15,965
"Allahrakha!"

1135
01:32:35,127 --> 01:32:42,665
"The paths were misty,
youth blossomed."

1136
01:32:42,755 --> 01:32:46,716
"You were unveiled."

1137
01:32:46,806 --> 01:32:50,840
"You were unveiled."

1138
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:54,756
"The ambience was playful."

1139
01:32:54,846 --> 01:32:58,465
"The ambience was playful."

1140
01:32:58,555 --> 01:33:02,208
"Neither did you notice
the danger?" - "Nor did I."

1141
01:33:02,298 --> 01:33:06,048
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1142
01:33:06,138 --> 01:33:09,973
"It led to an accident."
- "We made an agreement."

1143
01:33:10,063 --> 01:33:14,256
"It was permanent, oh God!"

1144
01:33:41,614 --> 01:33:47,965
"We'll have to
make up for the loss."

1145
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:52,325
"We have to fall in love."

1146
01:33:55,545 --> 01:34:01,548
"We'll have to
make up for the loss."

1147
01:34:01,638 --> 01:34:06,090
"We have to fall in love."

1148
01:34:07,011 --> 01:34:10,631
"Neither did you whistle,
nor did I."

1149
01:34:10,721 --> 01:34:14,336
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1150
01:34:14,426 --> 01:34:18,673
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1151
01:34:18,865 --> 01:34:22,750
"Two souls
are heartily celebrating."

1152
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:26,254
"It's neither your mistake,
nor mine."

1153
01:34:26,344 --> 01:34:29,974
"Neither did you see a signal?"
- "Nor did I."

1154
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:33,869
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1155
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:37,763
"It led to an accident, oh God!"

1156
01:34:37,853 --> 01:34:41,597
"It led to an accident."
- "We made an agreement."

1157
01:34:41,687 --> 01:34:45,965
"It's permanent, oh God!"

1158
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:50,148
"Allahrakha!"

1159
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:57,819
"Allahrakha!"

1160
01:35:00,938 --> 01:35:04,965
"Allahrakha!"

1161
01:35:13,055 --> 01:35:15,726
Do I offer them houses
at Rs. 5000?

1162
01:35:15,959 --> 01:35:19,100
They should get them at Rs. 5000
or I won't marry.

1163
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,839
Why do you care?

1164
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:24,061
Because the way they live,
they should get houses for free.

1165
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,276
But the houses...
- Just a minute.

1166
01:35:27,028 --> 01:35:31,798
If we agree
to offer them houses at Rs. 5000,

1167
01:35:31,962 --> 01:35:33,994
will you agree to get married?

1168
01:35:34,084 --> 01:35:36,381
Yes, but keep in mind,

1169
01:35:36,784 --> 01:35:40,090
I'll get married only when
the porters get their houses.

1170
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:43,722
Listen, all my brothers!

1171
01:35:43,812 --> 01:35:47,427
Keep your money ready!
We'll be getting our houses soon!

1172
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:49,298
Yes!

1173
01:35:52,482 --> 01:35:57,090
Let's go to the chit fund
to withdraw the money.

1174
01:35:57,306 --> 01:35:59,123
'BOB CHIT FUND'

1175
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:03,878
Welcome, Goga.

1176
01:36:03,968 --> 01:36:06,519
The police has raided
our Madras Fund. - What?

1177
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:11,298
Zafar told us to vacate this place
before the police reach here!

1178
01:36:21,608 --> 01:36:25,007
Hurry up Bob,
we should leave as soon as possible

1179
01:36:25,097 --> 01:36:26,710
and burn all the documents!

1180
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:28,840
So the police won't get
any evidence when they arrive...

1181
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:48,132
You're a spy?
Take him inside! Quiet!

1182
01:36:48,329 --> 01:36:51,172
Sunny?
- Be ready to go to jail.

1183
01:36:51,262 --> 01:36:53,864
You, dad and his followers!

1184
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,087
Take him upstairs!
- Tie him!

1185
01:36:57,177 --> 01:36:58,763
We'll decide about him
when Zafar comes.

1186
01:36:58,853 --> 01:37:01,985
You won't decide!
I'll show you!

1187
01:37:02,075 --> 01:37:05,682
I was on this case for a while!
Now I have proof!

1188
01:37:05,772 --> 01:37:09,118
All your bad deeds
will soon be exposed.

1189
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:12,255
Thief! Do you think
it's your money?!

1190
01:37:16,882 --> 01:37:17,965
Come on, boys!

1191
01:37:23,246 --> 01:37:24,673
The goods seem to be heavy.

1192
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,965
Do you need a porter?

1193
01:37:28,256 --> 01:37:30,381
Will you stop us?
- Yes.

1194
01:37:30,631 --> 01:37:33,043
Because the money is ours.

1195
01:37:33,133 --> 01:37:34,183
C'mon!

1196
01:37:41,659 --> 01:37:46,103
You have no place to run.
We've surrounded the place!

1197
01:38:38,423 --> 01:38:41,074
One hand of Maruti
is enough for you.

1198
01:38:41,381 --> 01:38:43,642
I made a mistake
by cutting only one hand.

1199
01:38:44,806 --> 01:38:46,876
I will cut the second one too.

1200
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:49,144
Give me the axe!

1201
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:00,598
How dare you shed
the blood of porters in my absence?

1202
01:39:01,573 --> 01:39:05,255
You burnt all the documents and
tried to run away with the fund?

1203
01:40:33,733 --> 01:40:34,827
Iqbal!

1204
01:41:04,884 --> 01:41:05,878
Did you see that, Iqbal?

1205
01:41:06,086 --> 01:41:07,711
My dad's acquaintances
tried to kill me

1206
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:09,822
but my mom saved me.

1207
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,836
That's why I always carry
my mom's photo with me.

1208
01:41:13,848 --> 01:41:15,503
That's what a mother is.

1209
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:19,461
Whenever I'm sad,

1210
01:41:21,483 --> 01:41:24,851
I pour out my heart
sitting in front of my mom's photo.

1211
01:41:25,848 --> 01:41:29,719
When I am happy, I go to
my mom's photo to express my joy.

1212
01:41:30,811 --> 01:41:35,961
You're fortunate
to have a mother and her picture.

1213
01:41:37,399 --> 01:41:39,560
I am so unfortunate
that I only have my mom's picture.

1214
01:41:40,256 --> 01:41:42,256
I don't have a mother.
- Why?

1215
01:41:44,161 --> 01:41:45,211
We were separated.

1216
01:41:46,165 --> 01:41:47,113
How?

1217
01:41:50,029 --> 01:41:51,044
A long time ago,

1218
01:41:53,545 --> 01:41:54,711
when I was eight years old,

1219
01:41:58,315 --> 01:42:00,049
there was a flood

1220
01:42:02,269 --> 01:42:03,336
that destroyed the entire village.

1221
01:42:05,783 --> 01:42:08,255
Mom and dad...

1222
01:42:10,521 --> 01:42:14,512
They all drowned.

1223
01:42:15,966 --> 01:42:20,480
After a while,
I saw my mom on the train.

1224
01:42:22,367 --> 01:42:26,882
I was telling her
that I'm her son.

1225
01:42:30,288 --> 01:42:33,266
But she was looking at me
with clueless eyes.

1226
01:42:35,246 --> 01:42:38,944
It was like
she didn't recognize me!

1227
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:42,599
I'll write about her in the paper.

1228
01:42:42,779 --> 01:42:44,345
We'll find her!

1229
01:42:44,615 --> 01:42:45,628
What's her name?

1230
01:42:50,909 --> 01:42:51,836
Salma.

1231
01:42:52,943 --> 01:42:54,003
Salma?

1232
01:42:54,809 --> 01:42:56,051
My mother's name is Salma.

1233
01:42:56,525 --> 01:42:57,587
Where is she?

1234
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:00,211
I've heard that she was abroad.

1235
01:43:01,295 --> 01:43:02,469
Abroad?

1236
01:43:35,755 --> 01:43:36,788
Mom!

1237
01:43:40,358 --> 01:43:41,395
Mom!

1238
01:43:41,894 --> 01:43:45,104
I am Iqbal, your son.

1239
01:43:46,311 --> 01:43:47,728
I'm here to take you along.

1240
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:52,146
Try to remember mom,

1241
01:43:53,311 --> 01:43:55,187
we were so happy!

1242
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:00,146
A flood
took all the happiness away.

1243
01:44:01,813 --> 01:44:02,770
Once...

1244
01:44:03,944 --> 01:44:07,020
Just once address me as your son
and embrace me.

1245
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:11,562
Or else I'll die at your feet.

1246
01:44:14,902 --> 01:44:16,603
Right from childhood,

1247
01:44:17,881 --> 01:44:19,854
not one day has passed

1248
01:44:21,698 --> 01:44:26,562
when I didn't miss you
and didn't cry.

1249
01:44:28,801 --> 01:44:30,020
Today...

1250
01:44:31,419 --> 01:44:34,854
After years,
fate is on my side.

1251
01:44:37,469 --> 01:44:38,895
Now, with a mother,

1252
01:44:39,764 --> 01:44:41,669
my life's goal is achieved.

1253
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:48,520
Let's go, mom.

1254
01:44:49,505 --> 01:44:50,562
Come with me.

1255
01:44:50,981 --> 01:44:53,478
I've come to take you with me.

1256
01:44:56,489 --> 01:44:59,812
Hey mister, you're under arrest.

1257
01:45:00,755 --> 01:45:01,799
For what offence?

1258
01:45:02,228 --> 01:45:03,854
Trying to kidnap this lady.

1259
01:45:04,451 --> 01:45:07,146
She's my mom.
- He's lying.

1260
01:45:07,854 --> 01:45:10,020
She isn't his mom
nor is he, her son.

1261
01:45:10,619 --> 01:45:12,227
You can ask the lady!

1262
01:45:12,923 --> 01:45:15,311
Is he your son?

1263
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:18,779
She can't speak.
She's lost her memory.

1264
01:45:20,228 --> 01:45:21,979
What's the proof
that she's your mother?

1265
01:45:22,697 --> 01:45:25,703
If you look into my heart,
you'll find my mother's image.

1266
01:45:26,183 --> 01:45:27,869
The law doesn't accept this!

1267
01:45:27,959 --> 01:45:31,228
Then even I don't believe
in your law.

1268
01:45:33,329 --> 01:45:34,409
She's my mother!

1269
01:45:35,141 --> 01:45:39,545
I'm taking my mom
and no one can stop me.

1270
01:45:40,811 --> 01:45:41,753
Come.

1271
01:45:46,228 --> 01:45:47,231
Leave my hand!

1272
01:46:13,687 --> 01:46:14,744
Mom!

1273
01:46:15,227 --> 01:46:16,895
Mom!

1274
01:46:29,305 --> 01:46:30,533
Stay there.

1275
01:46:46,018 --> 01:46:47,443
Hit him!

1276
01:47:03,267 --> 01:47:04,318
Don't talk nonsense.

1277
01:47:04,765 --> 01:47:06,193
He isn't Salma's son.

1278
01:47:06,412 --> 01:47:08,818
He wanted to run away
with our wealth.

1279
01:47:09,269 --> 01:47:12,443
You stole his biggest wealth,
his mom.

1280
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:15,893
Stealing at a thief's place
can't be called stealing.

1281
01:47:15,983 --> 01:47:17,568
Sunny!
- Don't shout!

1282
01:47:18,616 --> 01:47:22,193
I know what you do
and what your business is!

1283
01:47:23,356 --> 01:47:27,318
How you cheated the poor of
their money through the chit fund.

1284
01:47:28,636 --> 01:47:33,027

1289
01:47:50,876 --> 01:47:52,568
Then I won't publish it.

Zafar here.
- Yes, sir.

1299
01:48:17,503 --> 01:48:19,687

Salma, we have
so many business rivals.

1303
01:49:19,927 --> 01:49:25,774
They couldn't stand our progress
and wanted to kill our son.

1304
01:49:31,854 --> 01:49:34,984
I'll take you to the shrine today.

1305
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:39,817
You can read the holy book

for saving our son's life.

And you are
taking her to the shrine?

1310
01:49:58,469 --> 01:49:59,774
Where is the shrine?

1311
01:50:00,324 --> 01:50:01,609
In front of the jail.

1312
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:06,526
Then, after he leaves jail...

1313
01:50:10,817 --> 01:50:13,624
She's here to thank God
for saving her son's life.

1314
01:50:13,942 --> 01:50:16,817
May God give your son a long life.

May He keep you and your husband
in good health.

from all the perils.

Dear Julie!

1334
01:52:03,743 --> 01:52:06,304
I was waiting for this opportunity
for 14 long years.

1335
01:52:06,765 --> 01:52:11,797
To kill you
the day you stepped out of jail.

1336
01:52:11,887 --> 01:52:17,637
My child, I swear
that I didn't murder your father.

That'll be decided right away.

I'll pray to God before dying.

1339
01:52:46,558 --> 01:52:49,150
You had 5 chances
to prove yourself innocent.

1340
01:52:50,752 --> 01:52:52,954
I think you're innocent.

1341
01:52:53,179 --> 01:52:56,595
I said the same thing
insistently in the courtroom,

1342
01:52:57,472 --> 01:53:00,513
that I am innocent.

1343
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:06,113
But this wealthy world
didn't allow me to speak.

1344
01:53:07,978 --> 01:53:09,887
Who is the murderer of my dad?

1345
01:53:13,137 --> 01:53:15,262
When I was drowning,

1346
01:53:15,916 --> 01:53:20,637
there was one gentleman
who saved me.

1347
01:53:21,604 --> 01:53:25,105
That gentleman was your dad.

1348
01:53:26,095 --> 01:53:28,887
I had parted from my wife and son.

1349
01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:32,304
If it wasn't for his support...

1350
01:53:32,939 --> 01:53:36,804
He gave me a job in his mill.

1351
01:53:37,499 --> 01:53:40,513
Once the workers
got a bonus of 6 months,

1352
01:53:41,242 --> 01:53:44,095
but his partner
gave us a bonus of 1 month.

1353
01:53:44,262 --> 01:53:46,887
He got the documents
signed by us.

1354
01:53:47,513 --> 01:53:51,358
When my master found out,
he called his partner

1355
01:53:51,703 --> 01:53:53,054
and talked to him.

1356
01:53:54,072 --> 01:53:55,845
He denied the accusations.

1357
01:53:56,361 --> 01:54:00,262
Then he said, that whatever
has to be done, will be done.

1358
01:54:00,854 --> 01:54:05,546
When my master tried to
call the police, he shot him!

1359
01:54:05,762 --> 01:54:11,637
Before I could do something,
he threw the gun at me.

1360
01:54:11,911 --> 01:54:17,637
When I rushed to inform the police,
I bumped into his partner Mr. Puri.

1361
01:54:17,727 --> 01:54:21,500
I was pleading
that I was innocent.

1362
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:24,429
Suddenly you came down
on hearing the sound of the pistol.

1363
01:54:25,087 --> 01:54:27,577
And, found your father's dead body.

1364
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:32,625
That mean partner picked up a gun
lying on the ground as evidence

1365
01:54:33,015 --> 01:54:37,702
and started saying
that I had killed your dad.

1366
01:54:38,564 --> 01:54:41,109
Even you considered me
to be a murderer.

1367
01:54:42,753 --> 01:54:44,367
What's the name of the partner?

1368
01:54:44,457 --> 01:54:47,498
His name is Zafar.

1369
01:54:48,075 --> 01:54:49,095

1372
01:54:53,827 --> 01:54:56,601
Zafar, friendship and business
are two different matters.

1373

1375
01:55:02,907 --> 01:55:05,540
I tried doing many businesses
and I lost.

1376
01:55:05,743 --> 01:55:08,323
This was the only business left,
so I tried it.

1377

all the tenders in your name.

who will vote for you?

1380
01:55:19,829 --> 01:55:21,829

Julie, are you happy now?

1390
01:55:50,704 --> 01:55:53,102
Let's go.
I'm doing this for you.

1392
01:55:56,746 --> 01:55:58,854
Promise?
Which one?

1393
01:55:59,526 --> 01:56:01,120
That of getting married.

1394
01:56:01,686 --> 01:56:04,722
Marriage! Sure.

1395
01:56:04,812 --> 01:56:06,004

1399
01:56:14,706 --> 01:56:15,991
Yes, dad!

02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:38,937
but the poison
has spread throughout her body.

1443
02:01:39,237 --> 02:01:40,947
Her condition is very critical.

1444
02:01:41,037 --> 02:01:42,207
I can't predict anything.

1445
02:01:44,624 --> 02:01:47,849
How's mom? - It's difficult
to predict anything.

1446
02:01:50,766 --> 02:01:52,634
Sunny!

1447
02:01:53,136 --> 02:01:58,758
Iqbal, save my mother!
Please save my mother.

1448
02:02:00,126 --> 02:02:02,334
I'm taking an oath.

1449
02:02:02,424 --> 02:02:06,936
Once my mother is saved,
I'll never have liquor again.

1450
02:02:07,026 --> 02:02:08,926
I'll never drink!

1451
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:15,054
Don't be afraid, Sunny.

1452
02:02:16,404 --> 02:02:19,092
God is great

1453
02:02:20,484 --> 02:02:23,358
and listens to everybody.

1454
02:02:30,342 --> 02:02:31,169
What's the matter, Allahrakha?

1455
02:02:31,259 --> 02:02:38,419
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1456
02:02:38,509 --> 02:02:43,196
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1457
02:02:43,286 --> 02:02:48,005
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1458
02:02:48,529 --> 02:02:49,675
I got it.

1459
02:02:52,410 --> 02:02:53,484
I got it, Allahrakha.

1460
02:02:53,574 --> 02:02:55,467
You're telling me
to go for the pilgrimage.

1461
02:02:57,235 --> 02:02:59,467
Maybe God created you for this.

1462
02:03:00,983 --> 02:03:05,799
Now obeying your orders,
I'll go for the pilgrimage.

1463
02:03:07,845 --> 02:03:09,759
On behalf of the committee,

1464
02:03:09,849 --> 02:03:13,800
we welcome those who are
proceeding for the pilgrimage.

1465
02:03:14,047 --> 02:03:19,117
We request you all to keep

1466
02:03:19,433 --> 02:03:23,319
your passports, tickets
and doctor's certificate ready,

1467
02:03:23,409 --> 02:03:27,176
to get them checked
at the entrance.

1468
02:03:27,450 --> 02:03:31,094
You have fever.
Proceed for a medical check-up.

1469
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:37,162
You have high fever.

1470
02:03:37,252 --> 02:03:39,164
Don't worry, let me go.

1471
02:03:39,254 --> 02:03:41,407
We'll have to do a blood test.

1472
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:44,001
You might be suffering
from malaria, typhoid etc.

1473
02:03:44,263 --> 02:03:48,530
You can't travel until we're done
with the medical test.

1474
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:52,467
Even major diseases fade away
during the pilgrimage.

1475
02:03:52,557 --> 02:03:54,829
You're right, sir,
but I'm helpless.

1476
02:03:54,919 --> 02:03:58,940
We need to take care of formalities
in two countries.

1477
02:03:59,442 --> 02:04:00,492
I'm sorry.

1478
02:04:09,448 --> 02:04:11,315
Where is the priest?
- There.

1479
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:13,770
Greetings.

1480
02:04:14,834 --> 02:04:16,860
Hello.
- Greetings.

1481
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:18,076
What's the matter?

1482
02:04:18,166 --> 02:04:20,386
Please tell them to let me go.

1483
02:04:22,726 --> 02:04:26,754
My mother is critically ill.

1484
02:04:26,994 --> 02:04:30,286
I'm going on this pilgrimage
with great hope.

1485
02:04:30,488 --> 02:04:35,183
I'm ready
to knock the doors of God.

1486
02:04:35,439 --> 02:04:38,476
I'll pray a lot for my mom.

1487
02:04:38,566 --> 02:04:41,557
Please tell them to allow me,
it's the last boat.

1488
02:04:42,135 --> 02:04:45,982
My child, it's God's wish.

1489
02:04:46,912 --> 02:04:52,859
No one can go there
until He calls.

1490
02:04:54,953 --> 02:04:56,247
Look at that old man

1491
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:01,375
who has been
lying there for 15 days.

1492
02:05:01,956 --> 02:05:07,384
He says that he wants to go,
or he'll kill himself.

1493
02:05:08,022 --> 02:05:09,884
All his documents are ready.

1494
02:05:10,169 --> 02:05:12,447
But he doesn't have money
for a ticket.

1495
02:05:12,947 --> 02:05:16,381
You've got a ticket,
but you can't go.

1496
02:05:19,135 --> 02:05:20,793
Why don't you make an exchange?

1497
02:05:21,501 --> 02:05:22,467
Exchange?

1498
02:05:22,557 --> 02:05:24,075
Send him on your behalf.

1499
02:05:24,795 --> 02:05:27,705
Your pleas
will reach there through him,

1500
02:05:28,197 --> 02:05:30,417
and your mom will get a new life.

1501
02:05:31,875 --> 02:05:33,015
Bless you.

1502
02:05:42,579 --> 02:05:43,773
Uncle...

1503
02:05:47,961 --> 02:05:50,849
Uncle.
- Who's that? Oh, God.

1504
02:05:53,347 --> 02:05:54,689
What's wrong?

1505
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:57,150
Do you want to
go on the pilgrimage?

1506
02:05:58,755 --> 02:05:59,967
Yes.

1507
02:06:01,027 --> 02:06:04,009
He keeps testing all of us.

1508
02:06:04,342 --> 02:06:07,926
Now even I need to test Him.

1509
02:06:08,676 --> 02:06:12,096
Let's see if He wants to
shower his favours on the poor

1510
02:06:12,577 --> 02:06:14,856
and whether He wants to call us.

1511
02:06:14,946 --> 02:06:17,800
He has called you, uncle.

1512
02:06:18,755 --> 02:06:20,342
You'll surely go.

1513
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:22,130
Me?

1514
02:06:22,309 --> 02:06:23,344
Yes, uncle.

1515
02:06:24,483 --> 02:06:26,396
I want to send you in my place.

1516
02:06:27,671 --> 02:06:31,425
But you'll have to ask God

1517
02:06:31,758 --> 02:06:35,419
for a favour on my behalf.

1518
02:06:37,084 --> 02:06:40,466
Tell him to save my mom's life.

1519
02:06:41,171 --> 02:06:45,498
Pray to Him to save my mother!

1520
02:06:52,397 --> 02:06:53,842
Many years back,

1521
02:06:54,925 --> 02:06:57,955
my son promised to take me
on the pilgrimage.

1522
02:06:59,028 --> 02:07:02,667
Today, I feel as if

1523
02:07:03,559 --> 02:07:06,566
he's fulfilling that promise.

1524
02:07:15,014 --> 02:07:18,649
Praise...
- The Lord!

1525
02:07:18,818 --> 02:07:20,102
Happy pilgrimage.

1526
02:07:20,192 --> 02:07:23,432
May God keep you
and your mother happy.

1527
02:07:29,416 --> 02:07:36,113
"My eyes keep searching,"

1528
02:07:36,592 --> 02:07:43,780
"for God every day."

1529
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:53,863
"With Your grace,
I'm searching for God."

1530
02:07:56,136 --> 02:08:01,153
"Happy Hajj pilgrimage to you all."

1531
02:08:01,243 --> 02:08:05,905
"Happy Hajj pilgrimage to you all."

1532
02:08:05,995 --> 02:08:10,196
"I wasn't fortunate enough
to see Madina."

1533
02:08:10,286 --> 02:08:17,648
"Convey my prayers to Him."

1534
02:08:17,738 --> 02:08:23,061
"Convey my prayers to Him."

1535
02:08:23,151 --> 02:08:27,988
"Even the sea cried
seeing my agony."

1536
02:08:28,078 --> 02:08:32,786
"Even the sea cried
seeing my agony."

1537
02:08:32,876 --> 02:08:37,030
"I wasn't fortunate enough
to see Madina."

1538
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:42,030
"Convey my prayers to Him."

1539
02:08:42,153 --> 02:08:47,321
"Convey my prayers to Him."

1540
02:08:47,583 --> 02:08:54,240
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1541
02:08:54,676 --> 02:08:59,585
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1542
02:08:59,675 --> 02:09:04,138
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1543
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:38,776
"Everyone is equal over there."

1544
02:09:38,866 --> 02:09:43,738
"All possess equal status."

1545
02:09:43,828 --> 02:09:48,453
"Everyone is equal over there."

1546
02:09:48,543 --> 02:09:53,439
"All possess equal status."

1547
02:09:53,529 --> 02:09:58,321
"The one who goes
on the pilgrimage..."

1548
02:10:00,728 --> 02:10:09,837
"The one who goes on the pilgrimage
achieves victory."

1549
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:14,923
"He achieves victory."

1550
02:10:15,013 --> 02:10:18,987
"I wasn't fortunate enough
to see Madina."

1551
02:10:19,077 --> 02:10:23,869
"Convey my prayers to Him."

1552
02:10:24,030 --> 02:10:29,330
"Convey my prayers to Him."

1553
02:10:29,494 --> 02:10:36,196
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1554
02:10:36,559 --> 02:10:41,314
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1555
02:10:41,404 --> 02:10:45,613
"O my Lord,
here I am at Your service."

1556
02:11:19,709 --> 02:11:24,594
"I'm far away from the holy land."

1557
02:11:24,684 --> 02:11:29,404
"I'm far away from the holy land."

1558
02:11:29,494 --> 02:11:34,279
"Bless me here itself."

1559
02:11:34,369 --> 02:11:39,063
"Forgive me
as I'm fighting with time."

1560
02:11:39,153 --> 02:11:43,696
"I am helpless in my agony."

1561
02:11:43,786 --> 02:11:48,500
"Everyone
was blessed with fortune,"

1562
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:53,404
"but I just got thorns."

1563
02:11:53,494 --> 02:11:57,986
"I need not speak,
as You already know everything."

1564
02:11:58,076 --> 02:12:03,237
"Send me a sign of mercy."

1565
02:12:07,315 --> 02:12:12,227
"I understand that the stars
don't favour me right now."

1566
02:12:12,317 --> 02:12:17,513
"But don't separate
a son from his mother."

1567
02:12:19,381 --> 02:12:25,249
"If death is destined,"

1568
02:12:26,487 --> 02:12:32,178
"take my life but spare my mother."

1569
02:12:35,936 --> 02:12:41,613
"Oh king of heavens
and king of Madina..."

1570
02:12:45,245 --> 02:12:50,654
"Oh king of heavens
and king of Madina..."

1571
02:12:54,648 --> 02:13:00,237
"Oh king of heavens
and king of Madina..."

1572
02:13:09,671 --> 02:13:11,651
Mother!

1573
02:13:12,402 --> 02:13:13,408
Nurse!

1574
02:13:17,868 --> 02:13:20,097
Iqbal,
mom has regained consciousness.

1575
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:27,477
Your mom is fine now.
Don't talk too much, let her rest.

1576
02:13:27,634 --> 02:13:28,780
Just a moment.

1577
02:14:07,512 --> 02:14:10,072
Drinking has ruined
both his kidneys.

1578
02:14:11,128 --> 02:14:13,565
One kidney is enough to survive.

1579
02:14:14,127 --> 02:14:17,063
But he needs a kidney
of a living person

1580
02:14:17,447 --> 02:14:22,422
and I suppose as a father,
you'll donate one kidney to him.

1581
02:14:24,236 --> 02:14:25,309
Doctor,

1582
02:14:25,999 --> 02:14:27,780
never ever talk about this,

1583
02:14:28,632 --> 02:14:31,886
in front of him or my wife.

1584
02:14:32,659 --> 02:14:36,481
Even if he had been my son,
I wouldn't have donated my kidney.

1585
02:14:36,838 --> 02:14:39,488
Isn't he your son?
- No.

1586
02:14:40,484 --> 02:14:42,720
My wife was ill at that time,

1587
02:14:43,544 --> 02:14:45,481
a doctor like you advised me that,

1588
02:14:45,914 --> 02:14:50,842
if she had to recover, let
her embrace any child as her own,

1589
02:14:51,607 --> 02:14:57,405
so I brought an orphan
from an orphanage.

1590
02:14:58,463 --> 02:15:00,930
Neither is he, my child,
nor am I his father.

1591
02:15:09,982 --> 02:15:11,010
C'mon.

1592
02:15:14,249 --> 02:15:15,356
Sunny?

1593
02:15:15,742 --> 02:15:16,859
Where did he go?

1594
02:15:17,833 --> 02:15:23,164
Take everything,
my hat, coat and shoes.

1595
02:15:24,228 --> 02:15:26,808
This bottle has gone empty.

1596
02:15:29,921 --> 02:15:32,044
Sunny, what are you doing?

1597
02:15:32,524 --> 02:15:34,231
I went to the hospital
and I found that you escaped.

1598
02:15:34,636 --> 02:15:35,710
You're sick, let's go.

1599
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:39,111
Who are you to take me away?
- Your elder brother!

1600
02:15:39,856 --> 02:15:44,303
Did you listen?
He's my elder brother.

1601
02:15:45,390 --> 02:15:49,460
I don't know who my parents are
and he says he's my elder brother.

1602
02:15:49,882 --> 02:15:53,739
What's bothering you? Tell me,
I'll drink your sorrows away.

1603
02:15:53,829 --> 02:15:56,898
But don't ever say
I'm not your brother.

1604
02:15:57,177 --> 02:16:00,914
Our fortune has been written
by some inauspicious pen.

1605
02:16:01,086 --> 02:16:04,071
Don't say that.
- Let go!

1606
02:16:05,203 --> 02:16:07,115
You have a mom,
still, you didn't get her.

1607
02:16:08,151 --> 02:16:11,314
I lost her although I have her.
Mother!

1608
02:16:11,744 --> 02:16:12,686
Sunny!

1609
02:16:12,776 --> 02:16:13,985
Let go!

1610
02:16:15,735 --> 02:16:20,617
Even the bond of brotherhood
that we had, has been broken.

1611
02:16:21,525 --> 02:16:23,603
Go away, my brother.

1612
02:16:23,693 --> 02:16:25,612
Sunny!

1613
02:16:26,699 --> 02:16:28,079
I promise that
I'll break all my relations,

1614
02:16:28,169 --> 02:16:31,318
but I'll never
break our brotherhood. - Let go!

1615
02:16:32,110 --> 02:16:34,315
An orphan has no relations.

1616
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:38,910
I'm an orphan brought
from an orphanage in Kanpur!

1617
02:16:40,155 --> 02:16:42,270
Sunny!

1618
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:44,627
Go away!
- No, I won't leave!

1619
02:16:44,717 --> 02:16:46,265
Leave at once!

1620
02:16:52,607 --> 02:16:54,925
Sunny!

1621
02:16:56,636 --> 02:16:59,141
Uncle, call a taxi.
- Taxi!

1622
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:02,193
I was right.
He was drinking inside.

1623
02:17:02,501 --> 02:17:04,541
We need to take him
to the hospital.

1624
02:17:07,818 --> 02:17:08,860
Careful!

1625
02:17:09,544 --> 02:17:11,277
Why does he drink so much?

1626
02:17:11,546 --> 02:17:15,561
He found out that Mr Zafar brought
him from an orphanage in Kanpur,

1627
02:17:15,651 --> 02:17:16,818
he started drinking.

1628
02:17:29,212 --> 02:17:30,387
My son!

1629
02:17:30,570 --> 02:17:33,788
Iqbal, he's my son!
I recognize the mark on his foot.

1630
02:17:33,878 --> 02:17:35,320
He's my lost child.

1631
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:36,762
Your child?
- Yes!

1632
02:17:36,852 --> 02:17:39,064
We need to rush to the hospital.

1633
02:17:39,154 --> 02:17:40,804
I'll donate my kidney!

1634
02:18:09,257 --> 02:18:10,679
What's this in your hand?

1635
02:18:11,417 --> 02:18:14,921
You can't take that with you
to the operation theatre.

1636
02:18:15,011 --> 02:18:16,376
What's the matter?

1637
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,220
Sunny.
- Iqbal.

1638
02:18:20,043 --> 02:18:21,679
This is the girl I love.

1639
02:18:22,316 --> 02:18:23,959
I lost her in childhood.

1640
02:18:26,217 --> 02:18:29,969
If something happens to me...

1641
02:18:30,942 --> 02:18:32,679
You keep saying foolish things!

1642
02:18:34,301 --> 02:18:36,053
You'll be back shortly.

1643
02:18:37,170 --> 02:18:38,568
Go.

Where is Sunny?

1647
02:18:49,506 --> 02:18:50,862
In the operation theatre.

1648
02:18:52,830 --> 02:18:54,304
Why are you crying?

1649
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:56,679
What's wrong?
- He's crazy.

1650
02:18:58,182 --> 02:19:01,068
He said that I should burn this
photo if something happens to him.

1651
02:19:04,008 --> 02:19:06,684
Nothing will go wrong.

This...
This is my photograph!

Your photo?
- Yes.

1654
02:19:20,616 --> 02:19:23,694
Sunny and I used to
study in the same school.

1655
02:19:24,312 --> 02:19:25,512
Look!

1656
02:19:26,070 --> 02:19:30,540

There's going to be a programme
held for the minister.

Shall we also get married
on the same day?

1663
02:19:58,208 --> 02:19:59,554
Nice idea.

1664
02:20:00,676 --> 02:20:03,557
But I need to
get revenge on someone.

1665
02:20:03,737 --> 02:20:06,095
You have an entire life
to do that.

1666
02:20:06,399 --> 02:20:12,090
But we just have
a short span of time,

1667
02:20:12,494 --> 02:20:17,947
or else we'll never
be able to get married.

1668
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:20,920

I'm not educated!

I don't know how to give a speech.
- Right!

He keeps chatting
and says he can't give one.

1733
02:26:10,771 --> 02:26:14,939
But it requires money.
Where will we get that?

1734
02:26:15,771 --> 02:26:18,064
We don't need to buy votes.

What say, Allahrakha?

1738

You'll be the emblem of our party.

02:27:27,138 --> 02:27:29,638
I've been looking for you
since you were released...

1756
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:31,888
To apologize for my ill deeds.

1757
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:34,095
I've got good news.
- What?

1758
02:27:34,185 --> 02:27:36,360
Your wife and son are alive.

1759
02:27:37,763 --> 02:27:39,263
Alive?
- Yes.

1760
02:27:40,138 --> 02:27:42,276
Where are they?
- Let's meet them.

1761
02:27:42,618 --> 02:27:43,890
Iqbal!

1762
02:29:03,091 --> 02:29:04,376
Oh, God!

1763
02:29:06,263 --> 02:29:08,125
Iqbal!

1764
02:29:17,222 --> 02:29:18,422
'YOUR CANDIDATE, ZAFAR KHAN'

1765
02:29:32,292 --> 02:29:33,501
Zafar!

1766
02:29:34,459 --> 02:29:38,000
I won't let you
reach the election platform.

1767
02:30:36,056 --> 02:30:37,264
Stop!

1768
02:30:42,051 --> 02:30:46,269
Three cheers for Iqbal!

1769
02:30:46,359 --> 02:30:49,863
Three cheers for Iqbal!

1770
02:30:49,953 --> 02:30:53,265
Three cheers for Iqbal!

1771
02:30:53,355 --> 02:30:55,306
Three cheers for Iqbal!

1772
02:30:59,133 --> 02:31:00,930
Three cheers for you!

1773
02:31:01,659 --> 02:31:03,181
Because you,

1774
02:31:03,603 --> 02:31:06,429
in order to show the rich people,

1775
02:31:06,963 --> 02:31:10,065
took me to an election platform
from a railway platform!

1776
02:31:13,299 --> 02:31:18,111
You can ask any question
that you wish to ask.

1777
02:31:18,513 --> 02:31:23,139
Can an uneducated poor person
fulfil the needs of poor people?

1778
02:31:23,483 --> 02:31:25,430
Can you solve their grievances?

1779
02:31:25,685 --> 02:31:28,817
Can you provide them
food and shelter?

1780
02:31:28,907 --> 02:31:33,741
No one can do that,
because it's God who does that.

1781
02:31:34,453 --> 02:31:40,198
He has given us two hands
to earn our livelihoods.

1782
02:31:41,057 --> 02:31:43,816
You rich people...

1783
02:31:44,097 --> 02:31:47,847
You rich people
take away our share of food too!

1784
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:49,889
You suck our blood!

1785
02:31:49,979 --> 02:31:53,264
If you could,
you'd sell our souls too.

1786
02:31:57,299 --> 02:32:00,639
Do you think you're the ones who
shoulder all the responsibilities?

1787
02:32:01,394 --> 02:32:05,014
You need the rich to fulfil
the needs of so many people!

1788
02:32:05,474 --> 02:32:06,764
You'll have to agree,

1789
02:32:07,094 --> 02:32:10,348
nothing can happen
without rich people.

1790
02:32:10,537 --> 02:32:11,930
How's that possible?

1791
02:32:12,936 --> 02:32:16,097
Have you ever heard of rich people
sacrificing their lives at war?

1792
02:32:16,813 --> 02:32:18,342
It's the poor man

1793
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:21,180
who sacrifices his life
and makes his nation proud.

1794
02:32:24,096 --> 02:32:27,840
The world keeps moving
because of us.

1795
02:32:28,386 --> 02:32:30,828
Right from the Taj Mahal
to the smallest hut...

1796
02:32:30,990 --> 02:32:36,124
Every building has been
created by people like us.

1797
02:32:38,704 --> 02:32:43,767
The rich have created everything
by resorting to corruption.

1798
02:32:44,637 --> 02:32:46,264
These people buy votes for Rs 10...

1799
02:32:46,865 --> 02:32:48,889
Get approvals for Rs. 100...

1800
02:32:49,228 --> 02:32:51,722
Pay thousands to pass an exam...

1801
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:54,389
Shell out millions
to get tenders passed.

1802
02:32:54,479 --> 02:32:59,656
Only if the corrupt fail
will the nation progress.

1803
02:33:01,993 --> 02:33:04,970
Stop him
or I'll get a heart attack!

1804
02:33:05,060 --> 02:33:06,430
Where is Zafar?
- Dad!

1805
02:33:06,597 --> 02:33:09,389
Do I have to answer that?
- No!

1806
02:33:11,139 --> 02:33:13,389
I'll answer this question.

1807
02:33:15,728 --> 02:33:16,930
Move!

1808
02:33:21,854 --> 02:33:22,972
Brothers...

1809
02:33:23,852 --> 02:33:26,264
This blood and injuries,

1810
02:33:26,918 --> 02:33:28,930
were caused by this porter!

1811
02:33:29,732 --> 02:33:32,014
He didn't want me to come here,

1812
02:33:32,462 --> 02:33:35,847
so he shot me
by sending his girlfriend.

1813
02:33:35,937 --> 02:33:37,076
Lies!

1814
02:33:37,166 --> 02:33:40,056
Then check who's arrested
at the police station!

1815
02:33:41,132 --> 02:33:46,330
But I'll shower flowers on the one
who tried to do this.

1816
02:33:53,426 --> 02:33:55,056
Don't look there.

1817
02:33:55,954 --> 02:33:57,847
Listen to me first
and then look over there.

1818
02:33:58,796 --> 02:34:02,748
Your father, Mr. Aslam is alive
and he's in my custody.

1819
02:34:04,172 --> 02:34:06,097
My father?
- Yes.

1820
02:34:06,902 --> 02:34:09,790
The person
who's coming to that platform.

1821
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:24,847
Your father's life
is in danger right now.

1822
02:34:25,522 --> 02:34:28,936
So you better quit
the elections, or...

1823
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:36,972
What's the matter, son?

1824
02:34:39,430 --> 02:34:40,354
Uncle.

1825
02:34:41,775 --> 02:34:45,212
Is the person standing there,
my dad?

1826
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:56,805
Aslam!
Yes, he is your dad!

1827
02:35:02,061 --> 02:35:04,972
Welcome, Mr. Zafar.

1828
02:35:06,472 --> 02:35:12,156
Zafar has done great work
while offering a garland to me,

1829
02:35:13,521 --> 02:35:17,082
that I can't say anything,
nor defeat him.

1830
02:35:18,448 --> 02:35:19,513
My...

1831
02:35:21,006 --> 02:35:25,513
The answer to my prayers
is with him.

1832
02:35:27,312 --> 02:35:32,956
I withdraw my name
from the election

1833
02:35:34,389 --> 02:35:35,709
and apologize to all.

1834
02:35:35,799 --> 02:35:37,639
No...

1835
02:35:55,293 --> 02:36:00,264
He hasn't decided to step down

1836
02:36:00,555 --> 02:36:03,222
because of good work by Zafar.

1837
02:36:03,312 --> 02:36:06,907
Zafar must have blackmailed him!

1838
02:36:06,997 --> 02:36:11,430
This woman will voice out
all his bad deeds.

1839
02:36:24,204 --> 02:36:25,472
My husband,

1840
02:36:26,214 --> 02:36:27,472
Iqbal's father,

1841
02:36:28,356 --> 02:36:29,847
greetings to you!

1842
02:36:30,617 --> 02:36:32,597
Greetings to you, dear!

1843
02:36:32,756 --> 02:36:35,306
My brothers...
- How did she speak?

1844
02:36:36,695 --> 02:36:39,513
Mom, don't say anything
against Zafar.

1845
02:36:39,717 --> 02:36:40,972
Father's life is in danger.

1846
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:46,143
The Almighty who united
both of us,

1847
02:36:46,885 --> 02:36:48,889
will save his life.

1848
02:36:52,353 --> 02:36:56,597
Mr Zafar, you must be
very surprised to hear my voice.

1849
02:36:57,258 --> 02:37:03,011
It's God's miracle that
he returned my memory and speech.

1850
02:37:03,319 --> 02:37:05,197
Cut the wire of the microphone.

1851
02:37:05,287 --> 02:37:10,855
My brothers, this person who's
trying to collect your sympathies,

1852
02:37:10,945 --> 02:37:13,207
is a rascal and a cheat!

1853
02:37:13,297 --> 02:37:14,779
He has destroyed many...

1854
02:37:20,502 --> 02:37:24,942
You can't stop me
by cutting an electric wire.

1855
02:37:25,032 --> 02:37:29,226
I'll make sure that my voice
reaches every soul.

1856
02:37:29,389 --> 02:37:32,139
He killed my father!

1857
02:37:33,590 --> 02:37:37,930
He kept giving me electric shocks
for 20 long years,

1858
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:41,882
so that I don't recall
my husband and son.

1859
02:37:41,972 --> 02:37:44,975
This is injustice!

1860
02:37:45,065 --> 02:37:47,805
My brothers, I used to give her
electric shocks,

1861
02:37:47,895 --> 02:37:51,680
at the advice of a doctor
and not at my own will,

1862
02:37:52,176 --> 02:37:54,014
as she was mentally ill.

1863
02:37:54,306 --> 02:37:56,847
You can ask him if you want!

1864
02:37:58,359 --> 02:38:00,472
My dear brothers,
what shall I say?

1865
02:38:00,951 --> 02:38:04,597
Mr Zafar has spent his life
looking for her husband.

1866
02:38:04,989 --> 02:38:09,181
When he found him alive,
he brought him here,

1867
02:38:09,657 --> 02:38:15,097
so that he could unite them
in front of everyone!

1868
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:21,014
If you curse him, it'll be
as good as cursing humanity.

1869
02:38:22,097 --> 02:38:25,680
Mr. Aslam, proceed.
Your wife is waiting for you.

1870
02:38:32,358 --> 02:38:33,455
What are you doing?

1871
02:38:33,887 --> 02:38:35,680
I'm doing the right thing.

1872
02:38:35,770 --> 02:38:38,306
We could lose a lot
if we don't do this.

1873
02:38:38,555 --> 02:38:42,139
If the public gets violent,
we'll be done for.

1874
02:38:42,229 --> 02:38:45,597
I don't care about the public,
money and an election.

1875
02:38:46,406 --> 02:38:48,014
I've never learnt to accept defeat.

1876
02:38:48,795 --> 02:38:52,306
If I don't get Salma,
she can never be with anyone else!

1877
02:39:03,863 --> 02:39:07,385
Let's go! I think
something will go wrong here!

1878
02:39:14,597 --> 02:39:16,138
Uncle!
- Father!

1879
02:39:17,616 --> 02:39:18,805
Uncle!
- Father!

1880
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:23,847
I'll go on.

1881
02:39:24,714 --> 02:39:25,930
I've received the signal.

1882
02:39:28,008 --> 02:39:29,348
Iqbal...

1883
02:39:30,745 --> 02:39:33,174
He...
- Father!

1884
02:40:21,661 --> 02:40:23,715
We have to break the stage!

1885
02:40:34,333 --> 02:40:35,593
Move back!

1886
02:40:39,700 --> 02:40:42,297
Sunny!

1887
02:40:46,356 --> 02:40:48,738
Don't block my way,
or I'll kill everybody!

1888
02:40:50,744 --> 02:40:53,237
Leave me!
Let me go!

1889
02:42:17,967 --> 02:42:19,851
Come on.
- Leave me!

1890
02:42:20,310 --> 02:42:21,351
Zafar!

1891
02:42:22,523 --> 02:42:27,332
It's a holy shrine
and you can't enter it.

1892
02:42:27,422 --> 02:42:29,836
No one can stop Zafar!
- No!

1893
02:42:32,561 --> 02:42:34,534
Let go of me!

1894
02:42:36,041 --> 02:42:37,819
Leave my hand!

1895
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:43,234
God.
- Come on!

1896
02:42:49,194 --> 02:42:50,701
Oh, Lord! Please perform a miracle!

1897
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:04,442
How long will you survive?

1898
02:43:05,102 --> 02:43:07,150
There are three bullets left!

1899
02:43:07,442 --> 02:43:08,682
Shoot me!

1900
02:43:09,852 --> 02:43:13,914
If you have the weapons to kill
I have God with me!

1901
02:43:15,108 --> 02:43:20,613
Let's see if this sheet saves me
or becomes my shroud.

1902
02:43:21,484 --> 02:43:22,502
Shoot me!

1903
02:43:26,853 --> 02:43:32,830
'Nothing except Allah is worthy
of worship!'

1904
02:43:41,234 --> 02:43:49,812
'Peace and blessings be upon, Mohammad,
the messenger of God.'

1905
02:44:20,790 --> 02:44:28,730
'Nothing except Allah is worthy
of worship!'

1906
02:45:21,590 --> 02:45:26,564
"Allah is great."

1907
02:45:27,694 --> 02:45:29,053
Iqbal!
My son!

1908
02:45:29,475 --> 02:45:31,502
My, son!

1909
02:45:31,998 --> 02:45:35,549
My son.
- Enough, enough mother!

1910
02:45:36,909 --> 02:45:40,841
Mom, I'm alive
just to listen to this word.

1911
02:45:42,084 --> 02:45:47,444
Please call me your son once more.

1912
02:45:48,378 --> 02:45:52,068
