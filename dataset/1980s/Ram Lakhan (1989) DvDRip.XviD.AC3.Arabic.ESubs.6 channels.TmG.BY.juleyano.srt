00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:43,553
You've come here in this storm?

3
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:47,259
I've been watching you for 17 years.

4
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:51,699
Every morning you come here
to offer milk to Lord Shiva.

5
00:00:52,536 --> 00:00:55,596
Whether heat or cold,
hail or storm.

6
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,635
There must be something.

7
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:03,307
There has to be a story hidden
behind your mute worship.

8
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:07,743
Story? Ask him.
http://tamercome.blogspot.com

9
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:09,920
...who has written it.

10
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:12,755
But I want to hear it from you.

11
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:15,550
This story is incomplete.

12
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:20,931
When it is completed,
I'll definitely tell you.

13
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:29,701
It's raining heavily.
Why don't you wait for awhile?

14
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:35,311
Shut the windows.
Or the water will seep in.

15
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,650
The nursemaid is here.
Everything will be fine.

16
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,651
- Obeisance grandfather.
- Live long Ram. Sit here.

17
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:29,289
Will my little brother come today?

18
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,898
Yes, your little brother,
Lakhan, will come today.

19
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:37,398
The sun has risen but
Pratap hasn't returned.

20
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,910
Even I am worried about him.

21
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,706
The poor guy must be worried.

22
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,875
I'll be destroyed, ruined!

23
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,941
The court has sentenced Bhanu and
Bishambar to 4 years imprisonment.

24
00:02:49,387 --> 00:02:51,582
But who will pay their debts?

25
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,551
- You'll have to clear it.
- No, I've never taken loans.

26
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:02,729
By law, if one partner is imprisoned,
the other repays his debts.

27
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,529
The loans were taken
in the name of your company.

28
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:16,776
Scoundrels! What was our fault?

29
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:20,680
That we gave you refuge in our
house because you're my cousins?

30
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,608
Made you partner in the business?

31
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,448
Was that my fault? Answer me!

32
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:29,990
You kept gambling and smuggling!

33
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,692
Took loans in the company name!

34
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,592
You should have been
sentenced to a dog's death!

35
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:40,128
Quiet down. Or you too
will be caught by the law!

36
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,576
They have committed a sin
by betraying our trust.

37
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,809
That is why they are being punished.

38
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,681
We will bear the punishment.

39
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:58,017
You've committed a grave sin by
making them partners in our business.

40
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:00,690
How will we repay all the loans?

41
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,852
Who will rescue this house
from being mortgaged?

42
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,965
Grandfather, my Lakhan has come!

43
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:17,602
Lawyer uncle, my Lakhan has come!

44
00:04:22,913 --> 00:04:24,403
Show me my little brother!

45
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,083
Mother, see my little brother!

46
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:35,722
My two precious jewels.
One is Ram, the other Lakhan!

47
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,791
How did you let them in this house?

48
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:54,400
Despite knowing what difficulty and
shame we're borne, due to them!

49
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,534
I know my son. I know all.

50
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:03,009
But you must also not forget
they are my late brother's sons.

51
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:07,409
They have endured prison.
They must have changed.

52
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:09,545
They are demons not humans!

53
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:15,719
Whatever it be. I've given them
permission to stay here for a month.

54
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,719
- Sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

55
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,421
What are you doing?

56
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,660
You're a goddess! Uncle allowed
us to stay here because of you!

57
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:29,103
How can we repay your obligation?

58
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:32,540
You are elder to me.
Brothers in this house.

59
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:36,572
Go upstairs. Your wife
and son are waiting for you.

60
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:40,543
Look, I've waited for 4 years!

61
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,014
Now my parents won't
keep me at home longer!

62
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:48,952
Why do you worry? We've arranged
to stay here for another month.

63
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:55,889
- But after that?
- This house will be ours!

64
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:56,960
Really?

65
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:00,303
Pratap is my son. All my property...

66
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,966
Including the fields, house, godown.

67
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:09,277
Pratap and his sons Ram, Lakhan
will inherit everything.

68
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:16,817
But it is my desire that
out of the 105 acres land I own...

69
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:22,624
25 acres should be given to
Bishambar and Bhanu.

70
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,994
- Play with us.
- I will.

71
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,821
I've written down
everything in your will.

72
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:31,292
Here, sign it.

73
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,870
You wrote this in English.

74
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:39,399
- I can't read it.
- But you can sign in any language.

75
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,137
- I'll read it if you don't trust...
- No son.

76
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:45,643
No need for that. What you've
written must be right.

77
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,177
I want you to trust in me completely.

78
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:54,856
Don't talk like this.
You are Sharma's son.

79
00:07:55,392 --> 00:08:02,696
He wasn't just our lawyer
but almost a family member.

80
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,605
You forgot these sweets.

81
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,146
No!

82
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:39,464
This is a lie! Deception, conspiracy!

83
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:43,864
I won't let your plan succeed!

84
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:49,345
This is no plan. Here is the
will written by your father.

85
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,214
- Signed.
- What's the matter?

86
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:58,715
Did you hear? They are
showing me a will written by Dad!

87
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:01,790
According to which all this
property, this house...

88
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:05,252
...goes to Bishambar and you and
I get that ramshackle cottage.

89
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:13,329
And 5 acres of land!

90
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,737
You tell me if this is true.

91
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,370
Yes. He himself called me
and asked me to write this.

92
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:26,315
Do you mean Dad wished to
throw his own son on the road?

93
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,511
I won't believe it even if
God himself comes and tells me!

94
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,751
You have to accept
what's in the will.

95
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:38,322
You have to leave this house.

96
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:23,032
We must celebrate Debu's
birthday next week.

97
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,304
It will be celebrated!

98
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,273
And with great pomp!

99
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:55,198
Mother, I'm very hungry.

100
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,034
It's English.

101
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,472
Should I get milk for
brother from there?

102
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:05,237
No.

103
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:11,582
I'm going to get milk.

104
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,918
My stomach is paining.

105
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,489
Wait, I'll come with you.

106
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:22,760
I'll be back soon.

107
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,967
Have fun!

108
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:32,271
Sister-in-law!

109
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:37,543
See what this is.

110
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:43,015
- These ornaments lying...
- Shall I take some?

111
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,981
They aren't ours.
I'll keep it there.

112
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,555
Good grief! You in my room?

113
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,029
These are my ornaments!

114
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:02,728
Did you hear? She's robbing you
in bright daylight!

115
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,903
- Listen to me.
- Why are you yelling? What's it?

116
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:11,277
What is to happen? She was
running away with my ornaments.

117
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:13,615
...That I caught her.
- No.

118
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,247
I was putting them away safely.

119
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:21,222
That's what you'll say
now that you're caught!

120
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:25,693
You are telling lies.
My mother didn't steal.

121
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,888
There speaks the son of a thief!

122
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:33,027
Hold her while I call the police!

123
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:38,932
Have you all gone mad?
Would I steal?

124
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:45,141
In a condition like yours women
sell themselves not just steal!

125
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:51,014
May you be ruined!

126
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:58,584
First she tells lies.
Then she abuses my mother!

127
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,656
- Hitting a woman!
- Hitting a child!

128
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,395
Listen to this rascal!

129
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,902
- Give this to me. Get out!
- No! Let go!

130
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,905
Bitch went into my wife's room
and was stealing her ornaments!

131
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,346
Don't you dare step
in this house again!

132
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,578
Understood, you witch!

133
00:13:59,956 --> 00:14:04,256
How dare you! Bastard!

134
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:06,891
You hit my wife! Let go of me!

135
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:11,191
Rascal! Scoundrel!
Fight with a man!

136
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:14,795
If I don't rip you to pieces,
I'm not worthy of my name!

137
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:18,232
No, don't do this!

138
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:22,404
For my sake, let's go home.

139
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:27,277
It was my mistake that I went there.

140
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,353
Ram is very unwell. Come home.

141
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:36,081
I don't want there to be
bloodshed in this house.

142
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,661
For the sake of our children,
let's go home!

143
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:45,831
I'll show you the result
of what you accused us of!

144
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:49,261
You threw Dad's daughter-in-law
out of the house! Remember that!

145
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,106
Both of you keep in mind
I will avenge this!

146
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:13,623
It's scotch. Gulp it down.

147
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,524
Rascal!

148
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:25,073
The one who used to sell country
liquor now sells scotch!

149
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:29,275
He has bought a few trucks.

150
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,516
One gets so much fare in
ferrying liquor and drugs...

151
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:43,654
...that you claim the value
of the truck in just 6 months!

152
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:50,026
Why don't we sell the fields
and buy 25 trucks?

153
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,927
No, this property is Pratap's.

154
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:57,133
God will never forgive my sins.

155
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:03,344
I'll tell everyone tomorrow that
I made a wrong will by mistake.

156
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:06,043
I got him to sign it in Hindi.

157
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:12,551
He failed.

158
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,750
So we'll pass him.

159
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,338
Scoundrel! I'll just get the police!

160
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:55,896
He has failed.

161
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,335
Now he has passed.

162
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:07,500
Come on bad men!

163
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:35,427
No!

164
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:06,163
What kind of anger is this that
for property you kill the lawyer...

165
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:09,197
- And commit suicide thereafter!
- Suicide?

166
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,802
What else, he has committed suicide!

167
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,243
The poor man had gone mad.

168
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:32,157
What are you doing?

169
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,363
I'm collecting the
mortal remains of your Dad.

170
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,860
- Why?
- According to Hindu religion...

171
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:42,064
A man's remains are offered in
the Ganges after he is no more.

172
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:45,837
Only then will his soul attain peace.

173
00:18:50,313 --> 00:18:53,373
Sister, these are Pratap's remains.

174
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:02,952
These can only be immersed in
the Ganges by Ram and Lakhan.

175
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,588
I know.

176
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:40,118
I won't immerse my husband's
mortal remains in the Ganges.

177
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:47,525
I will make these remains a
live Thakur Pratap Singh.

178
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,794
And keep him with me.

179
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:52,265
Like a secret.

180
00:20:53,703 --> 00:20:57,161
I'll come to you everyday
wherever you are.

181
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,202
I'll wait for your justice.

182
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:02,945
Justice! Justice!

183
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,204
This is my pledge!

184
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,500
Where are we going?

185
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,635
We're going to our
clerk's uncle's house.

186
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,074
But don't go there and steal.

187
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,271
Your father is a thief!

188
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:39,775
Leave him!

189
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:43,946
Leave me. I'll show him!

190
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:52,624
Thank god the children didn't
see their Dad's terrible death!

191
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:57,598
Otherwise who knows what they
would do when they grew up.

192
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:02,598
But how did he die suddenly?

193
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:06,069
Don't ask how he died.

194
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:10,845
Ask how we have to live.

195
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:16,849
How do we turn Ram Lakhan
into Ram and Laxman.

196
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:40,339
You'll get a thrashing from me!

197
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,674
- Mother, he's beating me.
- He's refusing to go to school.

198
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:50,982
I just exercised.
My arms are hurting here.

199
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:55,251
You must go to school.
The teacher must be waiting.

200
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:58,183
He knows nothing.
Just keeps doing this.

201
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,587
Dear kids.

202
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,728
Why have you locked this?
What does it contain?

203
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,857
Nothing!

204
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:09,667
It has your father's things.

205
00:23:10,073 --> 00:23:13,565
And my matrimonial chain.
Never open this.

206
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,575
Go to school.

207
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:25,681
- Here's a kilogram of sugar.
- Here's a kilogram of sugar.

208
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:31,382
Feels lighter than a kilogram.

209
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:36,093
Lightweight! If your hands are
so light, the sugar will feel light!

210
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,366
See this weight for yourself.

211
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:41,259
And if you still don't believe me,
check the government seal.

212
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:42,629
Check it.

213
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:51,575
What are you doing here? Scoot.

214
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,506
- What have you stuck here?
- Keep quiet.

215
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:57,352
- I'll tell everyone.
- Run off now!

216
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,547
I'll tell everyone that
uncle is cheating!

217
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:04,721
Come here.

218
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:10,329
This boy is a complete
loss in my horoscope.

219
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,402
It's afternoon.
And you're still here?

220
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,146
I stayed back because of the storm.

221
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:44,851
I was thinking of old times.

222
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:50,281
Forget the past. Your penance
has borne fruit, hasn't it?

223
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,097
Yes. Some path has been decided.

224
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:56,622
Let me tell you one thing.

225
00:26:56,666 --> 00:27:00,693
The path of Ram is full of danger.

226
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:02,898
I see enemies all around.

227
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:10,908
I've sent my Ram to
face those enemies!

228
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:13,141
Every car and truck
must be checked.

229
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,678
Who dares to stop B B Trucks?

230
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:28,490
Please stop the car.

231
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,662
- We have to search the car.
- What nonsense!

232
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:36,701
You haven't recognized him.
He's a well-known man in this city.

233
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:38,268
But we have our orders.

234
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:43,270
For 15 years, nobody dared to
search our trucks or our car!

235
00:27:43,613 --> 00:27:47,549
We own 4000 trucks that ply
all over the country today.

236
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,641
- I know that.
- Doesn't matter.

237
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:52,915
Where is the commissioner?

238
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:55,153
- He's a good friend.
- Very good friend.

239
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:02,591
Tell them there are no friends or
relatives in the police force.

240
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:04,531
Son Ram!

241
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,128
Get them off the car
and search it thoroughly.

242
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,004
And if we refuse to get off?

243
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,241
Then the police will do its' job.

244
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:20,148
Will they push us out?
Or remove our clothes? What?

245
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:22,542
Keep quiet.

246
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,090
- What's the matter?
- You're in time.

247
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:35,886
- Tell him something.
- Let him search the vehicle.

248
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:38,097
This officer of mine
is very stubborn.

249
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:40,867
If he had his way,
he'd even search my vehicle!

250
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,094
We are decent people.

251
00:28:44,573 --> 00:28:47,440
Then why should you object
to being searched?

252
00:28:48,077 --> 00:28:52,309
The truth is in this area,
Sir John and Kesariya Vilayati...

253
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:56,174
...openly carry on smuggling.
So Ram and I pledged...

254
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:58,986
We'll give them good!

255
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:08,153
That pup of a dog!

256
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:11,092
He has started growling
in my presence!

257
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,266
I am your well wisher.

258
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:19,801
I feel for a couple of months
you should have no deals...

259
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:24,613
...with people like Sir John.

260
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:26,642
Should we suffer losses of crores?

261
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,615
It's better than going to prison.

262
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,110
Who will send us to prison?
That nincompoop?

263
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,381
Ram will take revenge
because of old times.

264
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,790
Let him! I'll set him right!

265
00:29:41,464 --> 00:29:44,194
Kesariya Vilayati and
his boss Sir John.

266
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:47,997
Once he is caught,
everyone will be caught!

267
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:51,663
- Brother!
- Now what is wrong?

268
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,168
Sir John's partner.

269
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,152
Bishambar here.

270
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:07,253
Biliya here.

271
00:30:09,158 --> 00:30:13,185
Sir John wants to know why our goods
haven't reached their destination.

272
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:19,365
We've worked with you for years.
Has such a delay ever taken place?

273
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:22,368
This time we're facing
some problems.

274
00:30:23,372 --> 00:30:27,934
Erase the problems.
You know Sir John

275
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:34,174
He considers anyone giving him
losses as his enemy.

276
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,517
Do something about Ram Pratap!

277
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:43,221
Sir John will chop off our head!

278
00:30:43,726 --> 00:30:45,785
- Don't think of it.
- What else do I think?

279
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:51,089
Listen to me and do as I say.

280
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,229
Everything will work out fine.

281
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,593
Should we fight?

282
00:30:55,271 --> 00:31:01,073
Don't you know how to
please a woman?

283
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:08,348
Brother of mine, come here.

284
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:13,244
Over a period man
realizes his mistake.

285
00:31:13,923 --> 00:31:16,687
There is blood relation between
Bishambar, Bhanu and Ram Lakhan.

286
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:20,127
There may have been enmity
in this relationship.

287
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,693
But in the end it turns to love.

288
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,491
That is why my sister
and her husband...

289
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,170
...have hesitatingly sent
these saris as gifts for you.

290
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:36,575
Even they are terribly happy
to see Ram progressing.

291
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:38,440
After all they are his uncles.

292
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:41,211
Keep them here.

293
00:31:44,553 --> 00:31:45,645
- You may go.
- Look...

294
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:50,218
By meeting each other, the
misunderstandings will be cleared.

295
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:52,761
Debu is to shortly
return from America.

296
00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,426
- May I leave? - Yes.

297
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:15,306
She didn't even ask
your brother for tea!

298
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,184
- Not even water.
- But she kept the saris.

299
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:22,749
- Let's see the effect.
- What effect will it have?

300
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,892
Brother!

301
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:58,615
Stop right there.

302
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,595
Listen to me carefully.

303
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:14,006
My husband...

304
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,068
...lives for me even today.

305
00:33:18,013 --> 00:33:22,143
I still have the pot
containing his mortal remains.

306
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:28,418
I haven't immersed them
in the Ganges as yet.

307
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:34,622
The splatter of blood
on my scarf...

308
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:37,597
I still haven't removed the stains.

309
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:44,166
So you've come to threaten us?

310
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,599
No. To explain.

311
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:51,504
To explain that the relations
you have already killed...

312
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:56,345
Don't try to give them life
by the clatter of your wealth.

313
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:01,985
Don't try to add fuel to the
fire flaming within a widow.

314
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,092
Ram and Lakhan are the two
weapons of a wounded woman.

315
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:09,755
Stay away from them.

316
00:34:10,232 --> 00:34:14,498
Or you'll meet the same fate
as the King of Lanka, Ravana!

317
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:19,434
Because his killers too
were named Ram-Lakhan!

318
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:39,193
The serpent has started
displaying her fangs.

319
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:57,444
What's the matter?
You sit in this temple for hours.

320
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,840
Nothing at all.
I just feel better.

321
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,748
What's in this box that you
never open nor let us touch?

322
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,918
I told you, things
belonging to your Dad.

323
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:17,257
My matrimonial necklace,
symbols of my marriage.

324
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:19,491
What do you keep thinking?

325
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,562
- Do you ever think of
what I think? - About what?

326
00:35:24,073 --> 00:35:28,601
- Lakhan who hasn't yet got a job.
- Everything will be all right.

327
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:34,579
Today is Shivratri. I had to go
to the temple but he vanished.

328
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,717
Must be with his friends.
Doing 1 +2=4, 4-2= 1.

329
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:44,120
- What does that mean?
- It means cheating.

330
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:45,524
Why do you say that?

331
00:35:47,162 --> 00:35:50,996
You will see someday my Lakhan
will prove to be Ram!

332
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,498
I too want my brother
to be greater than me.

333
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:58,033
- But...
- But what?

334
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,273
- Yes mother? - I met Geeta.
- What did she say?

335
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:16,738
She's looking for a job for Lakhan.

336
00:43:17,546 --> 00:43:20,174
- He can never get a job.
- Why?

337
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,410
The man who wants to become a
millionaire overnight...

338
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,615
...is not interested in any job.

339
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:29,686
That's because he's the
son of a millionaire.

340
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:35,121
Your heart is like an
umbrella over all his antics.

341
00:43:43,471 --> 00:43:46,998
Did you give him some money?

342
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:50,167
I have no money to give him.

343
00:43:57,352 --> 00:44:01,254
Mister Fraud, get up.
It's morning.

344
00:44:02,858 --> 00:44:06,191
- Good morning brother.
- Touching one's feet means...

345
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:08,695
...obeying elders.

346
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:10,988
Following their ideals.

347
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,395
Don't start this Ramayana
early in the morning!

348
00:44:15,003 --> 00:44:16,300
Are you annoyed with God?

349
00:44:17,372 --> 00:44:23,242
Not angry but today is
the time of Ravana not Ram!

350
00:44:23,945 --> 00:44:28,314
- Like?
- Like Bishambar and Bhanu!

351
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:32,544
Where are they and
where the hell are we!

352
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:35,019
It's a matter of time son.

353
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:40,423
Our time will also come.
Where can it go?

354
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,359
- Do you know what people say?
- What?

355
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:48,635
If I was the police officer
instead of you and...

356
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,800
...this treasure chest of a
police station was in my hands...

357
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:58,411
Then the vault keys of men like
Bishambar would be in my hands!

358
00:45:00,582 --> 00:45:05,178
Did you see the DSP's bungalow?
Did you?

359
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:10,515
- What a house! - Did you see
the handcuffs being made for him?

360
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:14,620
That we'll see when he wears them
But his bungalow got made!

361
00:45:16,698 --> 00:45:18,256
So you're planning
on building a bungalow?

362
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:24,370
Bungalows are not in our stars.
I don't even have a job!

363
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:28,201
If you don't have a job,
how do you have 600 bucks?

364
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:31,510
I found them in your purse.

365
00:45:33,081 --> 00:45:37,575
These? This is the donation
for yesterday's song and dance.

366
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:40,648
Swear by your brother and say
that this money is donation.

367
00:45:41,523 --> 00:45:44,981
I've often told you not to
put me in such dilemmas!

368
00:45:46,027 --> 00:45:48,086
The truth is this is no donation.

369
00:45:49,064 --> 00:45:51,965
- Then where did you get it?
- Somebody gave it. - Who?

370
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,699
The owner of Jeeva Transport.

371
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:55,495
- Shall I tell mother?
- No.

372
00:45:55,904 --> 00:45:58,236
- Shall I slap you?
- Yes.

373
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:03,142
For the last time get this clear...

374
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:07,843
If you try to spoil
my innocent brother...

375
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,611
I'll spoil your life!

376
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:14,253
Here are your 600 bucks!

377
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:21,417
So there's no chance of
my becoming a millionaire.

378
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:26,594
Neither will you become rich
nor will you marry Radha.

379
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:28,933
But the poor thing loves him.

380
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:32,063
- You are here?
- What's wrong?

381
00:46:32,574 --> 00:46:35,099
- Did you give my letter to her?
- I couldn't.

382
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,946
Her father has locked her in.

383
00:46:39,347 --> 00:46:40,609
The poor thing was crying hard.

384
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,175
Give me my magician's bag.

385
00:46:45,453 --> 00:46:47,921
- What will you do with this?
- What will I do?

386
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:07,003
He has come.

387
00:47:09,878 --> 00:47:14,542
Why do you start chanting prayers
the moment you see Lakhan?

388
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:19,519
Face turns red, chest blue and
hands yellow! What's the matter?

389
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:20,780
Do your work!

390
00:47:22,657 --> 00:47:26,388
I'm holding this since morning.

391
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:29,424
No customer came this way.
Only Lakhan has come.

392
00:47:36,504 --> 00:47:38,062
He is praying.

393
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,433
- At this hour? - He starts
praying the moment he sees you!

394
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:54,349
Radha isn't at home. Go away.

395
00:47:55,356 --> 00:47:57,620
I haven't come to see her.

396
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:01,759
I want to buy vegetarian eggs.

397
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:08,763
Eggs? You know it's a sin to even
talk of eggs, fish and meat out here!

398
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:11,869
Vegetarian eggs? What are they?

399
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:13,635
- Shall I show you?
- Yes.

400
00:48:15,176 --> 00:48:16,108
Like this.

401
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:19,269
Keep them away!

402
00:48:20,582 --> 00:48:23,210
You are a stigma on the name of
Lord Rama and the Hindu culture!

403
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:36,057
Stupid girl! How many times have
I told you to keep the window shut?

404
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:40,131
When I'm soft, I'm very soft.
But when I'm angry I spout fire!

405
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:47,237
Sir! Sir!

406
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:58,782
I kept telling you, 'Sir! Sir! '

407
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:05,950
Stupid oaf! Couldn't you have said
' Egg! Egg! ' instead of 'Sir! Sir! '

408
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:08,626
You just said it's a sin
to even mention its' name!

409
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,933
- What's the matter?
- He is sitting on eggs.

410
00:49:15,303 --> 00:49:18,238
Sitting on eggs? Is he a hen?

411
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,946
Is the egg outside?

412
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:34,620
I mean get up and see
the condition of the eggs.

413
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:39,358
What condition?
The egg must have broken.

414
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:42,329
Go and wash it off.

415
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:46,162
- Go and have a bath.
- Yes sir.

416
00:49:46,868 --> 00:49:50,201
Hope the eggs haven't
hatched under you.

417
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:54,872
People will make up all kinds
of stories about you.

418
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:58,145
Just check if there is
any egg on my backside.

419
00:49:58,513 --> 00:50:01,949
No sir but there is
a yellow colored flag.

420
00:50:04,886 --> 00:50:07,150
You have violated my sanctity!

421
00:50:08,323 --> 00:50:10,791
I will sort you out! I will!

422
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,923
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

423
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:16,190
Why are you creating a scene?
This happens sometimes.

424
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,289
Man eats in excess sometimes.

425
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:22,734
- He gets a stomach upset.
- And he does it in his clothes!

426
00:50:23,371 --> 00:50:25,305
What are you watching? Go home.

427
00:50:26,641 --> 00:50:29,542
I'll look after the shop.
You go home and have a wash.

428
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:34,010
Why don't you go home?
He will now go upstairs.

429
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:37,677
Wear new clothes. Everybody
does it including yourselves.

430
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:41,779
Vegetarian eggs.

431
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,482
What's the matter? You entered
and started bathing with cold water?

432
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:47,354
Let me at least warm up water.

433
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:51,389
To hell with the water! I'm in
trouble! Get my clothes, fast!

434
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:52,495
I'm bringing it.

435
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,970
- Go away or Dad will beat me!
- I haven't come to go away.

436
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,934
I've come here to stay.

437
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,743
Go away or father will thrash me!

438
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:12,016
Don't you love me?

439
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:18,019
See what I've bought for you.

440
00:51:18,793 --> 00:51:21,762
- Bangles!
- I'll slip them on your wrists.

441
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:23,797
- Are they nice?
- Very nice.

442
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:31,560
Do you know...

443
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:34,638
...that day when
I came to meet you...

444
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:37,838
My father thrashed me.

445
00:51:41,215 --> 00:51:43,979
Someday I'll hang
your Dad upside down!

446
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:49,783
Don't ever do that or
he won't let us get married!

447
00:51:50,558 --> 00:51:52,992
How will he stop us?

448
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:56,425
His father can't stop us!

449
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:01,997
Towel! Keep the towel ready!

450
00:52:03,571 --> 00:52:05,732
Should I show your Dad some magic?

451
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:10,036
Now he's crying.
Suddenly he'll start laughing.

452
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:13,008
- How?
- Like this.

453
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:22,786
I won't spare him!
I'll send him to prison!

454
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:36,898
Dad started laughing!

455
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:41,736
You're such a cute boy!
You're as naughty as ever!

456
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:46,875
- Magic! - When will you
stop these cute antics?

457
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:50,516
When you stop your stupid antics.

458
00:52:53,488 --> 00:52:56,150
Is this real or false?

459
00:52:56,657 --> 00:52:59,888
Go close and check.
You'll know if he stings you.

460
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:10,128
This is a cobra with mystical power.

461
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:12,798
And he wishes to ask you something.

462
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:15,502
What does the king of
snakes wish to ask me?

463
00:53:15,877 --> 00:53:21,008
He wishes to ask if
you will ever lock Radha up?

464
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:24,284
- No! - Will you beat her?
- Never!

465
00:53:24,752 --> 00:53:29,621
- Will you stop Lakhan from
meeting Radha? - Sometimes.

466
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:31,048
Never!

467
00:53:32,727 --> 00:53:35,992
- Your mother has come!
- No more magic!

468
00:53:37,732 --> 00:53:40,667
Now I'll tell your mother!

469
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:45,169
If you ever complain to my mother...

470
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:48,599
I have another kind of magic.

471
00:53:49,343 --> 00:53:52,005
By which I'll turn you
into a pigeon!

472
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:58,044
- Explain to him.
- Turn me into a pigeon!

473
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:01,187
Don't challenge him!

474
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:08,153
You don't know, Lakhan and his
friends know a lot of magic.

475
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,460
God forbid if they really
turn you into a hen...

476
00:54:13,868 --> 00:54:18,862
I'll have to sell eggs laid
by you in your own shop!

477
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:27,679
You should be ashamed.
You have grown up.

478
00:54:28,082 --> 00:54:29,640
Yet you behave like a kid!

479
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:33,516
I just went to meet him out of love.

480
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:35,949
Yes, I know your love.

481
00:54:36,457 --> 00:54:41,360
- And for whom.
- Then why don't you get them married?

482
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:47,802
First let him find a job, let Ram
get married. Then I'll think of it.

483
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:51,830
- Then get Ram married.
- He should like a girl for that.

484
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:53,401
There is a girl.

485
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:57,606
- Who?
- The commissioner's daughter.

486
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:05,675
Her love story with brother
is going on for a year now!

487
00:55:06,187 --> 00:55:07,814
Shut up! Shameless!

488
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:11,959
Is it possible that he likes
somebody and I don't know about it?

489
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:14,921
It is possible.
It is happening.

490
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,456
- Do you have any proof?
- I have proof.

491
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:20,198
- Show me.
- Reward?

492
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,398
You'll get whatever you want.

493
00:55:22,837 --> 00:55:27,137
Then you will talk to Devdhar uncle
about Radha and me, won't you?

494
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:29,238
Yes I will.

495
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:32,139
- First the proof.
- In a minute.

496
00:55:34,982 --> 00:55:39,078
Drop mother home. Now I'll return
only after getting the proof.

497
00:55:39,487 --> 00:55:43,184
Now see how he manages to
get things by fraud.

498
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:49,521
- Sir, call for you.
- Who is it?

499
00:55:49,864 --> 00:55:52,128
It's a girl, for you.

500
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,971
Sir, I'm Shantabai.

501
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:05,879
- Yes? - My mistress, Geeta
wants you to come home immediately.

502
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,308
She had a fall. She's badly hurt.

503
00:56:12,386 --> 00:56:13,410
I'll be there soon.

504
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:20,220
Shantabai here.

505
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:24,559
Dev Anand here.

506
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:30,196
Ram's assistant. How are you?
Are you fine?

507
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:34,905
Tell your mistress that
my sir has said what?

508
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,975
Get ready, to go out.

509
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:42,271
Time is short, destination
is far but have to go.

510
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:53,990
Call up the office and find out
if Mr. Ram has left or not.

511
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:57,462
What does he think of himself?
No sign of him for four days!

512
00:56:57,898 --> 00:56:59,661
Not a care about how I am!
And today!

513
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:04,333
Suddenly he misses me so
he asks Dev Anand to call me up!

514
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:09,162
Long live brother Ram!

515
01:03:09,737 --> 01:03:12,763
Long live sister-in-law Geeta!

516
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:10,396
This is India not America.
Ride the horse slowly.

517
01:04:15,302 --> 01:04:17,133
God knows where he has gone.

518
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,296
God knows what he has
eaten and grown up!

519
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,558
A pearl in the sea!

520
01:04:57,211 --> 01:05:02,308
Thakur Bishambarnath's son, Debu.

521
01:05:17,131 --> 01:05:18,325
Who is Lakhan?

522
01:05:24,705 --> 01:05:25,399
Who are you?

523
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,538
The son of the witch my Dad
threw out of the house!

524
01:05:35,549 --> 01:05:36,538
She had committed theft!

525
01:05:39,553 --> 01:05:40,713
Scoundrel!

526
01:06:02,609 --> 01:06:04,042
I'll set you right!

527
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:29,795
Save him!

528
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:50,953
Somebody save him!

529
01:07:03,403 --> 01:07:04,495
Son of a rascal!

530
01:07:06,707 --> 01:07:08,106
You abused my mother!

531
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,246
Lakhan is beating him up! Stop him!

532
01:07:19,386 --> 01:07:22,321
Bastard! I won't spare you!

533
01:07:28,161 --> 01:07:30,186
Take him away!

534
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,322
I won't spare you!

535
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:55,050
Don't hold me back!
This dog abused mother!

536
01:08:05,699 --> 01:08:09,692
You won't hit him. For my sake!
For your brother's sake!

537
01:08:11,605 --> 01:08:12,970
Calm down.

538
01:08:15,309 --> 01:08:17,004
This was not good.

539
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:23,043
The entire village is witness
that Lakhan hit Debu!

540
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:34,519
My baby! Open your eyes my love!

541
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:41,467
God knows what revenge
the rascals have taken!

542
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:45,469
Kill the rascal!
Or complain to the police!

543
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:50,400
No! This is no police matter.

544
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:54,276
This is a family feud.

545
01:08:56,650 --> 01:09:02,646
Just call that grocer here.

546
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:28,541
Exquisite!
I approve of your choice.

547
01:09:34,354 --> 01:09:40,156
My son wishes to marry your daughter.

548
01:09:41,128 --> 01:09:45,064
It's my good fortune that
my daughter, in this huge house...

549
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:50,635
But the problem is the girl
is slightly underage.

550
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:56,970
That's no problem.
Debu will wait for a year.

551
01:09:57,444 --> 01:10:01,540
For her, I'll wait for many years!

552
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:07,185
- So the girl is ours.
- Absolutely!

553
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:10,985
We'll get them married
whenever we wish.

554
01:10:11,191 --> 01:10:14,160
As you wish. My Radha will
only become your daughter-in-law.

555
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,462
Hey you! Here, eat this!

556
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:30,599
Look, now you're going to be
the bride of a respected family.

557
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:35,681
Not the beloved of that
hooligan, ruffian, loafer Lakhan!

558
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:40,745
Understood? Here.

559
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:45,757
- Open your mouth.
- Eat it. He's giving it with love.

560
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,919
Eat it.

561
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:28,090
They want to ruin my life!

562
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:30,601
I have understood.

563
01:11:31,671 --> 01:11:37,007
By buying Devdhar, they have thrown
another stone at our happiness!

564
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:38,837
I'll set their house aflame!

565
01:11:39,513 --> 01:11:43,108
- Will you do just what they did?
- Then what do I do?

566
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,675
The brave don't lower their heads.

567
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,282
Make yourself so big that their eyes
automatically close by your glitter.

568
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:55,289
But in the meanwhile at least
talk to Radha's father.

569
01:11:56,162 --> 01:12:01,691
Your mother may have carried
the stigma of poverty for 17 years.

570
01:12:02,168 --> 01:12:06,662
But she never let go of the
rag of her self-respect.

571
01:12:07,374 --> 01:12:11,105
We have to make others bend,
not bend before others.

572
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:18,546
Becoming a big man
means becoming rich.

573
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:21,181
And there are only
2 ways of doing it.

574
01:12:21,755 --> 01:12:24,189
Either become a smuggler
or a police officer.

575
01:12:24,558 --> 01:12:31,361
- Meaning? - Simple. Pocket what
men like Bishambar make.

576
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,294
But how do I become
a police officer?

577
01:12:35,702 --> 01:12:39,103
Why don't you meet Daddy for a job?

578
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:43,465
- How can I?
- Meet him, do something.

579
01:12:43,843 --> 01:12:48,280
Create such an aura that
everyone is left agape!

580
01:13:00,527 --> 01:13:02,552
- You haven't eaten anything.
- Water.

581
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:07,631
We've just got news that Kesariya
Vilayati is hiding in our area.

582
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,464
If we don't nab him now,
our image will take a beating.

583
01:13:11,905 --> 01:13:13,429
- How are you son?
- Fine uncle.

584
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:21,906
Can I become a police officer?

585
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,450
Sure. Why not?

586
01:13:25,251 --> 01:13:28,220
To serve the country
or to earn money?

587
01:13:28,588 --> 01:13:31,989
Both. Can I?

588
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:42,332
Yes sir, all efforts
are on to nab him

589
01:13:46,272 --> 01:13:51,039
Only one man can tell us his
whereabouts. The barber, Dhondhu.

590
01:13:52,712 --> 01:13:58,309
A lion is hiding in a stable!

591
01:13:59,386 --> 01:14:02,753
Even the police's grandfather
can never guess this place!

592
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:20,167
The brave don't attack
an unharmed dacoit!

593
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,265
Who the hell are you?

594
01:14:22,942 --> 01:14:26,878
Great man, I'm the
grandson of Sultana.

595
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:29,606
The police is chasing me.

596
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:50,760
Sultana's son, a bad man?

597
01:14:51,771 --> 01:14:53,966
Good man not bad man!

598
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:57,939
- The police?
- My private police!

599
01:15:01,981 --> 01:15:07,112
I'm Ram's brother Lakhan.
Let's go to the police station!

600
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:14,423
What? Kesariya is caught!

601
01:15:15,662 --> 01:15:18,756
Lakhan caught him?
Are you sure?

602
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:24,898
That was terrific!

603
01:15:25,405 --> 01:15:30,138
What my force couldn't do in 10 days,
you've managed in 8 hours!

604
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:38,713
Actually, sir, your force
is becoming somewhat lazy.

605
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:44,488
If they use some brains,
a little guts and some courage...

606
01:15:44,824 --> 01:15:46,758
What are these criminals?

607
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:50,628
We catch such men everyday!

608
01:16:15,088 --> 01:16:21,721
Seeing your bravery and intelligence,
a thought comes to mind.

609
01:16:22,962 --> 01:16:24,987
Why don't you join the police?

610
01:16:30,637 --> 01:16:36,701
Sir, this used to be my dream,
to serve the nation and its' people.

611
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:42,504
But my brother doesn't believe
that I'm capable of anything.

612
01:16:43,216 --> 01:16:46,185
If I say I want to become a
police officer, he'll say. ' No! '

613
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,652
I too have some qualities.

614
01:16:56,763 --> 01:17:01,723
And I recommend your name for
the special training force.

615
01:17:02,068 --> 01:17:03,194
You get ready to leave.

616
01:17:05,338 --> 01:17:06,896
Sir are you pulling my leg?

617
01:17:08,908 --> 01:17:14,039
Then should I go and tell mother
I have become a police inspector?

618
01:17:14,647 --> 01:17:16,808
Not become, but will become.

619
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:33,260
Now he'll tell you the same things
about me that I already told you,

620
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:44,100
I've heard everything. What
you're about to do is not right.

621
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:48,271
He's very childish. He doesn't know
the responsibility of an officer.

622
01:17:49,148 --> 01:17:51,139
He's my brother.
I know him very well.

623
01:17:51,784 --> 01:17:53,684
Once he becomes an officer,
there will be total chaos!

624
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:59,217
You're saying the same things
he told me you'd say.

625
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:02,027
- But sir...
- No buts.

626
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:06,263
He's your darling brother.
And seems like a child to you.

627
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:10,032
But look at him from my eyes.
I recognize the diamond well.

628
01:18:10,637 --> 01:18:12,161
- After all I did find you too.
- But sir...

629
01:18:33,259 --> 01:18:35,750
I too will cry if you cry.

630
01:18:36,396 --> 01:18:38,956
I'm only going for
a 6-month training.

631
01:18:39,365 --> 01:18:41,799
She's crying as if
I'm going to war!

632
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:45,904
And I'll never return.
Brother why is everyone crying?

633
01:18:46,339 --> 01:18:50,503
Son, everyone is worried
that you might fail.

634
01:18:52,345 --> 01:18:55,678
Laxman can't fail when
he has Ram's blessings with him.

635
01:18:56,082 --> 01:18:57,447
And I have it.

636
01:19:01,254 --> 01:19:06,988
I pray to God that when you return
you're wearing... not this cap...

637
01:19:07,727 --> 01:19:10,252
But a police officer's cap!

638
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:15,098
And you become the greatest
police officer in India!

639
01:19:19,472 --> 01:19:21,201
Hurry up or you'll miss the train!

640
01:19:23,609 --> 01:19:24,405
I'm going.

641
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,569
He still has to meet Radha.

642
01:19:30,249 --> 01:19:32,740
What will happen to me?

643
01:19:33,586 --> 01:19:34,712
They will take me away!

644
01:19:35,588 --> 01:19:38,250
I'm going away to become
a weapon for the enemy.

645
01:19:39,459 --> 01:19:42,986
If they get me married
behind your back?

646
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:48,858
- But we're already married.
- When?

647
01:19:49,836 --> 01:19:54,671
- In a previous birth, in heaven.
- Heaven?

648
01:19:55,441 --> 01:19:57,170
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes. Where is it?

649
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:02,013
There, in the moon.

650
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:06,148
- Can you see it?
- I can't.

651
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:10,520
Look at the moon.

652
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:13,116
At the moon, not me.

653
01:20:14,327 --> 01:20:15,055
Shut your eyes.

654
01:20:16,763 --> 01:20:20,961
Say, Om 3 times. Stretch it.

655
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:58,504
I'll fulfill my word.

656
01:21:00,006 --> 01:21:01,166
Wait for me.

657
01:21:14,554 --> 01:21:18,490
Debu says he wants to
go out with Radha.

658
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:23,060
I told him in our family girls don't
go out before they are married.

659
01:21:23,563 --> 01:21:26,964
So he immediately agreed.
This is called family upbringing.

660
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:34,131
A husband should be like this.

661
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:39,744
Yes a husband must be like him.

662
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:51,119
Lakhan still hasn't returned.

663
01:21:54,927 --> 01:21:58,863
Bishambar and Bhanu have invited
both of us for Debu's birthday.

664
01:21:59,866 --> 01:22:00,764
You may go. I won't.

665
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:03,965
You'll have to go. For Radha.

666
01:22:04,737 --> 01:22:07,365
She has nobody else.
Lakhan too isn't here.

667
01:22:11,477 --> 01:22:16,915
What? You invited Ram for
Debu's birthday party?

668
01:22:19,485 --> 01:22:22,852
I've even sent his
mother an invitation.

669
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:31,525
So that she comes and sees
how her honor, her arrogance...

670
01:22:31,931 --> 01:22:34,399
...is being crushed under my shoe!

671
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:40,304
- I haven't understood.
- Radha was to marry Lakhan.

672
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,571
The whole city knows that.

673
01:22:43,476 --> 01:22:53,078
That same Radha in public, will put
her arms around Debu not Lakhan!

674
01:22:54,253 --> 01:23:00,123
I'll make the wretch dance
amidst the prostitute's.

675
01:23:00,493 --> 01:23:02,461
No, I won't go there.

676
01:23:03,162 --> 01:23:05,824
I don't want to go there!

677
01:23:06,532 --> 01:23:15,372
A woman's struggle is fought with
her determination not her tears.

678
01:23:16,642 --> 01:23:22,808
If you have the determination
and true love in your heart...

679
01:23:23,349 --> 01:23:26,011
It won't take long
for them to crash down.

680
01:23:28,354 --> 01:23:32,222
The whole world will watch.

681
01:23:33,893 --> 01:23:40,196
Whichever song you sing should be
in praise of Debu and this family.

682
01:23:51,077 --> 01:23:52,840
Welcome!

683
01:23:53,012 --> 01:23:57,506
This party lacked the sun and moon.
They too have arrived!

684
01:23:57,984 --> 01:24:00,646
Blessed are we that Ram came here!

685
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,185
Please come in.

686
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:13,930
Take a seat. This is a special
seat for special guests only.

687
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:15,827
See, Ram has come.

688
01:24:26,712 --> 01:24:27,474
Brothers...

689
01:24:28,214 --> 01:24:36,679
Shastri's daughter, on the occasion
of our son, Debu's birthday...

690
01:24:36,956 --> 01:24:40,119
...will sing a melodious song.

691
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:51,427
Some people may appreciate
her song and dance.

692
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:55,868
And some may not like it.
But those who don't approve...

693
01:24:56,442 --> 01:24:59,172
...should keep sitting
in their seats.

694
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:05,747
They mustn't leave because even if
prostitutes are singing, dancing...

695
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:09,313
The party is of decent people.

696
01:25:12,591 --> 01:25:18,996
Gifted girl, get up.
Everybody's eyes are on you.

697
01:25:19,565 --> 01:25:23,729
Begin your song before us.

698
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:28,668
Come on. Get up.

699
01:25:32,912 --> 01:25:35,608
See how pretty she is.

700
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:38,183
Sit in front of Debu.

701
01:30:58,437 --> 01:31:00,428
Which Lakhan are you talking about?

702
01:31:58,864 --> 01:32:00,229
I'll kill you!

703
01:34:01,299 --> 01:34:03,995
Have you explained our
problem to Sir John?

704
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:06,661
- Yes.
- She's told him.

705
01:34:07,272 --> 01:34:11,902
You will be punished because
you cheated Sir John in business!

706
01:34:13,345 --> 01:34:15,745
Not me sir. That was Shankar.

707
01:34:16,015 --> 01:34:17,346
- Whose man was he?
- Mine.

708
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,940
- Who made this promise?
- I did.

709
01:34:20,752 --> 01:34:21,878
Then who should be punished?

710
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:27,283
Take the body away!

711
01:34:34,566 --> 01:34:39,196
If you say, we'll come another day.

712
01:34:39,738 --> 01:34:41,205
Don't be afraid. Come with me.

713
01:34:51,616 --> 01:34:52,742
How are you?

714
01:34:53,685 --> 01:34:56,313
Bibiya must have told you everything.

715
01:34:59,257 --> 01:35:02,658
Sir John feels it's more important
to release Kesariya from prison...

716
01:35:02,994 --> 01:35:05,554
Rather than kill Ram and Lakhan.

717
01:35:05,864 --> 01:35:09,027
- Why? - Because our
goods worth 26 crores...

718
01:35:09,267 --> 01:35:13,636
Only Kesariya knows where
it is hidden across the border.

719
01:35:14,072 --> 01:35:19,203
Our problems have increased since
Lakhan became a police officer.

720
01:35:21,413 --> 01:35:26,715
But we've heard that Inspector
Lakhan wants to shake hands with you.

721
01:35:27,085 --> 01:35:29,519
This is his trick.

722
01:35:29,988 --> 01:35:33,583
You have to make Lakhan your arrow

723
01:35:33,859 --> 01:35:37,761
An arrow before which
even Ram is helpless.

724
01:35:38,163 --> 01:35:41,496
If we play games, so will they.

725
01:35:44,169 --> 01:35:45,864
Let them play.

726
01:35:47,205 --> 01:35:49,867
We'll play later.

727
01:35:53,345 --> 01:35:55,438
It's thanks to your devotion that...

728
01:35:55,814 --> 01:35:59,147
Ram is a senior inspector today.

729
01:35:59,484 --> 01:36:02,146
And Lakhan too is in the force.

730
01:36:03,789 --> 01:36:06,986
I've heard you're going
on a 2 month pilgrimage.

731
01:36:08,059 --> 01:36:13,691
Yes, it was my desire...

732
01:36:14,366 --> 01:36:22,501
The day my sons would be settled,
I'd go on a pilgrimage to Amarnath.

733
01:36:24,075 --> 01:36:28,603
I can understand what
a struggle it must have been.

734
01:36:29,714 --> 01:36:34,879
The struggle is over not the war.

735
01:36:36,822 --> 01:36:38,756
The battle is about to begin.

736
01:36:39,057 --> 01:36:41,992
I have to win this war.

737
01:36:43,628 --> 01:36:46,426
I've seen enough poverty in my life.

738
01:36:47,365 --> 01:36:53,326
But if you keep giving me
these little boxes of chocolate...

739
01:36:54,472 --> 01:36:57,168
Then what will happen to my
program of poverty eradication?

740
01:36:58,977 --> 01:37:02,310
First let the job get done.
Then you'll get big boxes too.

741
01:37:06,484 --> 01:37:07,746
Come in brother.

742
01:37:09,254 --> 01:37:11,950
Just to remind you that we have to
go to the station to drop mother.

743
01:37:12,257 --> 01:37:14,748
I know. You go ahead. I'm on my way.

744
01:37:18,029 --> 01:37:23,558
I mean does anybody bring
chocolates to the police station?

745
01:37:24,035 --> 01:37:27,527
Call me home. We'll eat there.
We'll fill our stomach.

746
01:37:27,873 --> 01:37:32,640
And as you've given this with love,
let it remain close to my heart.

747
01:37:33,345 --> 01:37:34,073
Your job will be done.

748
01:37:44,356 --> 01:37:45,846
Live long my children.

749
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:51,160
Always love each other like this.

750
01:38:22,427 --> 01:38:25,089
- Brother?
- Have you eaten?

751
01:38:25,797 --> 01:38:28,288
Would I have eaten without you?

752
01:38:29,034 --> 01:38:32,936
Thought I'd play the tambourine.
I'll warm up dinner.

753
01:38:38,009 --> 01:38:39,237
Come and sit here.

754
01:38:41,112 --> 01:38:47,881
When you were born, I ran
and shouted at the top of my voice...

755
01:38:48,353 --> 01:38:51,914
My brother has come!
My Lakhan has come!

756
01:38:53,124 --> 01:38:54,489
Yes, mother did tell me.

757
01:38:55,527 --> 01:38:59,258
She must have also told you
why Dad named us Ram and Lakhan.

758
01:39:00,231 --> 01:39:02,324
To destroy the evil!

759
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:09,201
To follow the ideals
of Lord Ram and Laxman.

760
01:39:10,675 --> 01:39:16,011
These are old tales. These days
Ramayana is just a book.

761
01:39:16,414 --> 01:39:18,143
It's just a drama, a TV serial.

762
01:39:18,683 --> 01:39:20,708
Everybody enjoys watching it
but following it is different.

763
01:39:21,286 --> 01:39:23,083
Times have changed.

764
01:39:23,455 --> 01:39:26,754
Times keep changing and
will continue to change.

765
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:31,527
But the ideals of Ramayana
existing for thousands of years...

766
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:36,357
...has never been and can never be
changed by a man living for 80 years!

767
01:39:37,135 --> 01:39:39,160
You and I are nothing at all!

768
01:39:39,738 --> 01:39:41,365
I don't understand you.

769
01:39:41,606 --> 01:39:44,939
I'll explain.

770
01:39:46,745 --> 01:39:50,545
The chocolate you were trying
to eat in uniform today...

771
01:39:50,915 --> 01:39:55,249
...can turn into poison tomorrow.

772
01:39:56,121 --> 01:40:00,182
And neither can Mother bear
to see you consume poison...

773
01:40:00,525 --> 01:40:02,288
Nor me.

774
01:40:03,028 --> 01:40:06,259
- I did nothing of that sort.
- Nor will you do it!

775
01:40:06,898 --> 01:40:09,992
Don't make me promise.
I put you under oath!

776
01:40:10,301 --> 01:40:11,359
Or you'll see me dead!

777
01:40:11,836 --> 01:40:12,996
No promises!

778
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:35,817
Sir, these trucks of BB Roadways
without any checking, openly...

779
01:40:37,462 --> 01:40:41,228
The rope should be left slack
before you catch the big elephant.

780
01:40:45,136 --> 01:40:48,401
Let them go. The owners of
BB Roadways are related to me.

781
01:40:48,706 --> 01:40:54,440
Will you shame me by stopping them?

782
01:40:55,613 --> 01:40:56,807
Well done nephew.

783
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:01,109
You've cleared our test.

784
01:41:02,954 --> 01:41:04,888
There will be chaos!

785
01:41:05,623 --> 01:41:08,990
Uncle a businessman!
Nephew a policeman!

786
01:41:09,761 --> 01:41:12,229
Peace all around!

787
01:41:12,964 --> 01:41:15,228
- My first fee.
- How much?

788
01:41:15,967 --> 01:41:17,264
A lakh.

789
01:41:20,071 --> 01:41:22,835
Give him a lakh.

790
01:41:27,912 --> 01:41:31,245
Let the relation be sealed.
Eat a sweetmeat my kid.

791
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:36,051
Sweetmeat? Of love?

792
01:41:37,222 --> 01:41:39,918
- Eat one uncle.
- No, I'm diabetic.

793
01:41:40,058 --> 01:41:44,051
The doctor has prohibited me.
I will die if I eat it.

794
01:41:44,462 --> 01:41:45,656
- For my sake.
- I will die.

795
01:41:47,098 --> 01:41:48,429
Eat it dear uncle.

796
01:41:57,208 --> 01:41:58,402
He ate it!

797
01:42:03,014 --> 01:42:07,348
I'll pay them back for
everything they did to you!

798
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:11,018
Everything they have is ours.

799
01:42:12,223 --> 01:42:13,622
And I will get it back.

800
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:21,558
If I lose your support
in this war, I will die!

801
01:42:21,866 --> 01:42:26,997
No, I am with you.

802
01:42:27,906 --> 01:42:29,635
These are your 2 lakhs.

803
01:42:38,449 --> 01:42:41,850
- Brother?
- We want to search your bag.

804
01:42:42,453 --> 01:42:45,183
There's nothing in this.
Just something for the house.

805
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:47,421
Search this bag.

806
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,625
What are you doing?

807
01:42:58,036 --> 01:42:59,333
- Sir, this bag?
- Quickly open it.

808
01:43:01,806 --> 01:43:02,500
Get married soon.

809
01:43:09,714 --> 01:43:11,181
I don't understand one thing.

810
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,813
By some way Lakhan has
become an inspector.

811
01:43:15,186 --> 01:43:16,949
But how has he got so much money?

812
01:43:17,589 --> 01:43:20,990
He wields a lot of clout.

813
01:43:21,426 --> 01:43:23,690
He locks up anyone.

814
01:43:24,195 --> 01:43:26,720
He has turned crazy!

815
01:43:27,465 --> 01:43:30,366
You know the owner of BB Roadways?

816
01:43:30,702 --> 01:43:33,262
He lost his tongue before him!

817
01:43:33,538 --> 01:43:36,735
Sit up! I don't lose my tongue
before anybody at all!

818
01:43:38,176 --> 01:43:39,768
- You've lost it!
- What? - Hour tongue!

819
01:43:40,245 --> 01:43:41,473
How?

820
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:50,578
Surround the shop!

821
01:43:50,955 --> 01:43:54,118
Keep sitting! People manipulate
things in changing positions!

822
01:43:54,792 --> 01:43:56,589
- You've been raided!
- What?

823
01:43:56,861 --> 01:44:01,161
From today I'm not brother
but Inspector Lakhan Pratap Singh!

824
01:44:04,302 --> 01:44:08,261
Read out the public's complaints.

825
01:44:08,706 --> 01:44:12,904
Complaints against you.
Listen! Report number 1

826
01:44:13,278 --> 01:44:15,337
He mixes stones in the rice.

827
01:44:15,613 --> 01:44:17,877
- Report 2? - He sticks extra
weight to the bottom of the scale.

828
01:44:18,182 --> 01:44:21,379
- Report number 3?
- He stocks oil in the room inside.

829
01:44:22,887 --> 01:44:24,752
The punishment for
adulteration and hoarding?

830
01:44:25,123 --> 01:44:27,614
3 years imprisonment.

831
01:44:27,892 --> 01:44:30,122
And a fine of 50000 rupees!

832
01:44:31,562 --> 01:44:33,154
Sound!

833
01:44:34,032 --> 01:44:38,526
- Listen, son. - Do law keepers
listen to the people or criminals?

834
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:42,801
I find you very cute
when you scold me.

835
01:44:46,044 --> 01:44:48,911
This is your own shop,
your own house my son.

836
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:54,244
Will you raid your own house?
My sister, Sharda...

837
01:44:57,188 --> 01:44:59,418
You may go. I'll follow.

838
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:05,960
This miser is making me
emotional by taking mother's name.

839
01:45:06,564 --> 01:45:09,727
He's not a miser.
He is Radha's father.

840
01:45:12,937 --> 01:45:17,601
Have you forgotten your childhood?
You'd call me uncle then.

841
01:45:17,942 --> 01:45:22,777
Radha is waiting for you.
We were just talking about you.

842
01:45:23,181 --> 01:45:26,912
Lakhan hasn't come... is what we said.

843
01:45:27,151 --> 01:45:29,847
Have tea before you leave.
Meet Radha too.

844
01:45:32,156 --> 01:45:35,091
She has made sweetmeats for you.

845
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:38,796
On one condition.

846
01:45:41,432 --> 01:45:45,493
Only if Uncle himself
will make me tea!

847
01:45:47,071 --> 01:45:49,335
Today even his Pop will do this!

848
01:45:49,841 --> 01:45:53,038
In the meantime, come up
and meet Radha. What sir?

849
01:45:53,411 --> 01:45:54,810
Yes, yes.

850
01:46:05,523 --> 01:46:07,718
Eat the sweetmeat.

851
01:46:09,093 --> 01:46:12,358
Do you recall when I was small
Radha would feed me sweetmeats?

852
01:46:12,663 --> 01:46:16,394
Not only that, I remember
everything. You were so cute!

853
01:46:16,901 --> 01:46:22,203
Then even today I will only eat
when Radha feeds it to me.

854
01:46:23,975 --> 01:46:26,205
Feed him dear.

855
01:46:26,611 --> 01:46:28,135
The enemy has now become an inspector!

856
01:46:34,585 --> 01:46:39,682
Didn't you tell Uncle of
all the scoundrels I arrested?

857
01:46:40,091 --> 01:46:43,288
Yes, you did. Except for one.

858
01:46:43,561 --> 01:46:47,463
- Whom? - Sir, I'm ashamed
to take your name.

859
01:46:48,733 --> 01:46:55,866
I mean first of all,
he raided Seth Dhaniram.

860
01:46:56,707 --> 01:47:00,302
The second was Dinaram.
He had him hung upside down.

861
01:47:00,645 --> 01:47:03,375
And hit him in this very spot
that the sky turned red.

862
01:47:03,748 --> 01:47:06,410
I've brought gold bangles for you.

863
01:47:09,954 --> 01:47:16,917
- What will happen to us?
- Whatever I wish!

864
01:47:17,528 --> 01:47:20,122
Lakhan has manipulate little things.

865
01:47:21,232 --> 01:47:25,726
But he can't release a prisoner
like Kesariya from prison.

866
01:47:26,571 --> 01:47:29,699
To top it that case is in Ram's hands.

867
01:47:30,441 --> 01:47:33,535
Whoever's hands it be in,
I want Kesariya!

868
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:36,744
At any cost.

869
01:47:37,381 --> 01:47:42,182
What's the relation between Bishambar
and Sir John. Where's his hideout?

870
01:47:45,256 --> 01:47:50,421
I told you a hundred times I don't
know where Sir John's hideout is!

871
01:47:50,862 --> 01:47:53,262
Where is Sir John's hideout?

872
01:47:53,364 --> 01:47:56,822
Have you heard, Biliya has
called Lakhan to her house.

873
01:48:01,205 --> 01:48:03,435
We are fully confident...

874
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:08,338
...that you can release
Kesariya from jail.

875
01:48:09,313 --> 01:48:12,146
And we'll give you a
bungalow worth 12 lakhs.

876
01:48:12,483 --> 01:48:14,280
And 2 lakhs in cash.

877
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,855
You want to be richer than Bishambar

878
01:48:19,257 --> 01:48:20,315
I even know this.

879
01:48:22,994 --> 01:48:26,225
How did you find out all this?

880
01:48:27,899 --> 01:48:32,461
Here's your advance of 2 lakhs.

881
01:48:34,605 --> 01:48:38,200
But there's only one way to
become richer than Bishambar.

882
01:48:38,976 --> 01:48:40,967
You must appease Sir John.

883
01:48:41,913 --> 01:48:44,404
Sir John will take you to the skies.

884
01:48:44,782 --> 01:48:49,981
I know that Sir John is the one
who took Bishambar to the skies!

885
01:48:52,523 --> 01:48:56,391
But some people forget their
position once they hit it rich.

886
01:48:56,727 --> 01:48:58,888
They also forget humanity.

887
01:48:59,363 --> 01:49:03,766
They think the ones
on the ground as corpses!

888
01:49:05,403 --> 01:49:09,032
By the way we think alike.

889
01:49:14,178 --> 01:49:16,442
I will positively keep my word to you.

890
01:49:26,224 --> 01:49:30,593
If Lakhan makes place in Bibiya's
heart, he'll ruin all of us!

891
01:49:30,995 --> 01:49:33,828
Then he'll sit in Sir John's
lap and shoot at us!

892
01:49:35,132 --> 01:49:38,124
This key can open
any lock in this world.

893
01:49:38,769 --> 01:49:40,134
It's called master key, my friend.

894
01:50:01,559 --> 01:50:06,622
Tell me where is Sir John's den!

895
01:50:12,436 --> 01:50:18,068
If you think you're a master
and you'll find some such key...

896
01:50:18,609 --> 01:50:23,444
...using which you'll break
out of here, you're wrong!

897
01:50:40,898 --> 01:50:42,263
Sir, Kesariya has run away!

898
01:50:42,566 --> 01:50:46,366
- What?
- I want to know how he escaped!

899
01:50:51,509 --> 01:50:54,672
I'm very pleased to meet
a player like yourself.

900
01:50:57,381 --> 01:50:59,542
He's a very capable hero.

901
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:06,812
Sir John is hosting a grand party
in your honor for freeing Kesariya.

902
01:51:09,694 --> 01:51:12,857
May I also call my poor friends?

903
01:51:13,331 --> 01:51:16,960
- Absolutely not!
- They dance very well.

904
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:20,834
We've seen them dance
This is western dance.

905
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:24,835
Not what beggars dance in streets.

906
01:51:25,943 --> 01:51:29,242
Debu has called dancers from
America especially for this party.

907
01:51:30,114 --> 01:51:36,815
When my son sings and dances
even Bibiya will be astounded.

908
01:51:38,389 --> 01:51:42,689
Then why not call both parties
and have a competition?

909
01:51:43,361 --> 01:51:47,320
And I'll give the winner
anything he desires.

910
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:52,358
Do you understand the meaning
of a reward you desire?

911
01:51:52,837 --> 01:51:54,805
He could even ask for your Radha.

912
01:51:56,507 --> 01:52:00,136
I won't even give him half a Radha!

913
01:52:00,778 --> 01:52:07,081
If you lose tonight,
we're all destined to ruination!

914
01:52:07,752 --> 01:52:11,449
I've danced for 12 years in America!

915
01:52:12,223 --> 01:52:14,714
What will these Indian fools
dance in comparison to me!

916
01:52:18,696 --> 01:52:24,362
Debu added some pills to the betel
leaf they're eating to turn them mad!

917
01:52:28,506 --> 01:52:30,906
There's something fishy in the betel.

918
01:52:33,611 --> 01:52:38,048
Be careful. The enemy is
out to destroy us.

919
01:52:39,183 --> 01:52:41,708
It must be one of our own men
who helped Kesariya escape.

920
01:52:42,753 --> 01:52:44,152
And you have to find this Ram.

921
01:52:45,389 --> 01:52:49,257
Don't forget if I don't
find him in thirty days...

922
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:52,222
I'll have to resign.

923
01:52:52,897 --> 01:52:55,195
Who could have betrayed us?

924
02:01:14,865 --> 02:01:19,063
Hearsay can be wrong but not
what you see for yourself!

925
02:01:19,469 --> 02:01:22,905
You were drunk and happy
in Sir John's party!

926
02:01:23,206 --> 02:01:25,766
Yes. I don't deny that.

927
02:01:26,376 --> 02:01:28,742
One has to be part of the gang
before one can blow its' cover.

928
02:01:29,246 --> 02:01:32,773
This was my secret mission.
I wanted to reach Sir John's house.

929
02:01:33,116 --> 02:01:35,607
Did you take the commissioner's
permission for this mission?

930
02:01:36,186 --> 02:01:37,448
Did you take help
from any other officer?

931
02:01:37,788 --> 02:01:42,248
Ram sir's method of working
is different from mine.

932
02:01:43,527 --> 02:01:47,691
Yes, they are all trying to
understand your way of working.

933
02:01:48,665 --> 02:01:53,659
How can an officer possess a house,
TV, fridge, etc. In a short while?

934
02:01:54,304 --> 02:01:58,604
Everybody knows I won a lottery.
I have proof.

935
02:01:59,743 --> 02:02:04,976
These days only people *******
win lotteries, never the poor!

936
02:02:05,449 --> 02:02:09,112
So you mean to say I'm the king
of all these nefarious activities!

937
02:02:09,186 --> 02:02:13,953
Maybe not but you are the soldier
who shuts his eyes while on duty.

938
02:02:14,992 --> 02:02:18,587
Does business and steals with
people like Jeeva and Bishambar!

939
02:02:20,263 --> 02:02:21,855
- Brother...
- Don't call me brother!

940
02:02:23,033 --> 02:02:25,501
Right now you are in a police
station, talking to your senior!

941
02:02:27,237 --> 02:02:32,140
Under such circumstances,
wouldn't it be better if...

942
02:02:32,442 --> 02:02:35,639
...such an officer is transferred
or removed from the department.

943
02:02:37,180 --> 02:02:41,514
Only my enemy can think of
removing or transferring me out.

944
02:02:41,918 --> 02:02:47,550
Or the person who envies me
my fame, my progress, my money!

945
02:02:48,458 --> 02:02:50,085
Who is jealous of my success!

946
02:02:52,162 --> 02:02:54,653
You mean I'm jealous of you?

947
02:02:55,298 --> 02:02:58,995
Bishambar and Bhanu always
told me but I never believed them!

948
02:02:59,469 --> 02:03:01,164
How can a brother be
jealous of his own sibling?

949
02:03:01,571 --> 02:03:06,565
But today I'm convinced in
matters of business and career...

950
02:03:06,877 --> 02:03:08,469
A brother can be jealous!

951
02:03:12,416 --> 02:03:13,678
You mean to say that...

952
02:03:15,052 --> 02:03:18,044
I am jealous of you?

953
02:03:18,388 --> 02:03:21,414
Yes, you are jealous of me.

954
02:03:24,494 --> 02:03:28,362
- I'm jealous of you?
- Yes, you are jealous!

955
02:03:29,933 --> 02:03:33,733
- I'm jealous of you?
- Yes, you are jealous!

956
02:03:34,371 --> 02:03:36,566
Will I be jealous of you?
Of my own brother?

957
02:03:37,574 --> 02:03:38,973
Will I be jealous of your success?

958
02:03:52,456 --> 02:03:56,051
I'm surprised that a man like you
can suddenly become so emotional!

959
02:03:57,894 --> 02:04:00,624
Yes sir, I became emotional.

960
02:04:11,441 --> 02:04:18,677
Now watch how the old woman
loses both her weapons!

961
02:04:28,425 --> 02:04:29,756
This journey is very long.

962
02:04:30,961 --> 02:04:34,260
Who knows when we'll reach home.

963
02:04:37,267 --> 02:04:40,600
We will make it with
the help of this stick.

964
02:04:41,972 --> 02:04:43,735
Someday we will reach there.

965
02:04:44,641 --> 02:04:47,109
Great! This is how
one should make progress.

966
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:50,673
My best wishes on buying
this new bungalow.

967
02:04:51,381 --> 02:04:54,441
- All your blessings.
- Now do one more thing.

968
02:04:55,719 --> 02:04:59,416
Get a pretty little bride
to adorn this new house.

969
02:05:00,223 --> 02:05:02,851
Just what I wanted to do.

970
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:06,787
I can't even imagine you'd make
a house with your sinful earnings.

971
02:05:07,464 --> 02:05:11,662
- Who told you this?
- Brother Ram told my Dad.

972
02:05:12,335 --> 02:05:14,030
What you are and what you'll become!

973
02:05:14,571 --> 02:05:19,873
- What will I become?
- You'll go to prison!

974
02:05:20,877 --> 02:05:26,008
You've let me down! I don't want
your love! Take back your bangles!

975
02:05:26,816 --> 02:05:27,578
And forget me.

976
02:05:41,498 --> 02:05:43,090
You are great.

977
02:05:43,767 --> 02:05:46,759
Your formula number
34 fit beautifully!

978
02:05:53,710 --> 02:05:55,268
What are you doing here?
Where's Lakhan?

979
02:05:55,912 --> 02:05:58,608
- Didn't he meet you?
- What do you mean?

980
02:05:59,649 --> 02:06:02,709
- He... home...
- What? Home?

981
02:06:02,986 --> 02:06:06,012
He left home.

982
02:06:09,859 --> 02:06:13,625
He took his things
and mother's temple.

983
02:06:19,369 --> 02:06:22,304
We pay you for your chair.

984
02:06:22,973 --> 02:06:25,271
- Not for being Ram's brother!
- Meaning?

985
02:06:25,875 --> 02:06:30,403
Your brother has sworn to have
you removed from your chair!

986
02:06:31,014 --> 02:06:34,609
- Who told you this?
- We have our own CID.

987
02:06:36,119 --> 02:06:40,453
Enough. Our job is done.

988
02:07:06,216 --> 02:07:10,812
Do whatever you please.
Now I'll never come in your way.

989
02:07:13,423 --> 02:07:18,861
Before leaving mother left the
responsibility of this temple to me.

990
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:22,054
And I've come to take this back.

991
02:07:24,034 --> 02:07:26,468
This temple will stay here only.

992
02:07:27,137 --> 02:07:29,401
It will stay where mother stays.

993
02:07:30,106 --> 02:07:32,870
Mother will stay here, with me!

994
02:07:33,777 --> 02:07:37,508
Mother will decide where she
will stay, not you.

995
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:43,544
So till she returns,
her temple will be here.

996
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:50,084
Mother's temple will be here where
everything stinks of sinful earnings?

997
02:07:50,727 --> 02:07:54,356
Sin and virtue are words made
by old fashioned people like you!

998
02:07:54,831 --> 02:07:58,028
Who walk around with the arrogance
of virtue and righteousness!

999
02:07:58,401 --> 02:08:01,165
Who neither understand anyone's
feelings nor their pain!

1000
02:08:01,805 --> 02:08:03,238
Whose pain are you talking about?

1001
02:08:04,741 --> 02:08:08,040
The one whose temple
you want to take away.

1002
02:08:08,945 --> 02:08:10,674
Have you ever thought of her pain?

1003
02:08:11,381 --> 02:08:13,110
Have you ever felt her past wounds?

1004
02:08:19,889 --> 02:08:23,518
You are talking of the old wounds
that I know very well.

1005
02:08:24,828 --> 02:08:29,162
But I'm thinking of the
wounds coming her way

1006
02:08:29,666 --> 02:08:32,226
...which will be worse
than the old wounds!

1007
02:08:33,370 --> 02:08:35,861
When she returns to see your true self

1008
02:08:36,606 --> 02:08:39,268
A thief hidden behind a uniform!

1009
02:08:40,377 --> 02:08:43,471
The law keeper who one day
will be in the hands of the law!

1010
02:08:44,381 --> 02:08:48,112
Have you ever thought
wounded she will be?

1011
02:08:48,685 --> 02:08:53,486
What will she feel when
she sees her two sons...

1012
02:08:53,923 --> 02:08:56,721
...who were her hopes,
her weapons, her strength...

1013
02:08:57,193 --> 02:08:59,718
...are now broken, fragmented!

1014
02:09:00,663 --> 02:09:02,722
You are responsible for this.

1015
02:09:04,067 --> 02:09:05,329
- I?
- Yes, you!

1016
02:09:07,103 --> 02:09:09,571
You always considered your
little brother too little!

1017
02:09:10,173 --> 02:09:13,233
Whenever I wanted to proceed,
you kept some hurdle in front of me!

1018
02:09:13,643 --> 02:09:16,874
You always tried to break
the ladder that was taking shape!

1019
02:09:18,715 --> 02:09:21,548
You told Devdhar! Commissioner!

1020
02:09:21,985 --> 02:09:25,386
Slapped and insulted me in
front of the police department!

1021
02:09:25,755 --> 02:09:30,522
You took my childhood love,
Radha away from me!

1022
02:09:32,595 --> 02:09:33,994
Now what do you want?

1023
02:09:35,632 --> 02:09:38,066
You want to take my mom away from me!

1024
02:09:39,569 --> 02:09:42,231
I have only one support.
Do you want to snatch that too?

1025
02:09:42,739 --> 02:09:45,105
Yes, I want to take away everything!

1026
02:09:45,642 --> 02:09:48,304
Because I'm your enemy not brother!

1027
02:09:49,546 --> 02:09:53,539
I'm a scoundrel! A stigma on
the name of a brother like Rama!

1028
02:09:54,751 --> 02:09:56,241
Is this what you wish to say?

1029
02:09:57,153 --> 02:10:01,590
I can take no more!

1030
02:10:02,559 --> 02:10:05,153
Waiting here for one moment
will be worse than a storm!

1031
02:10:09,299 --> 02:10:11,426
You won't take this temple.

1032
02:10:12,602 --> 02:10:13,159
Move out!

1033
02:10:16,873 --> 02:10:18,465
You've hit me enough!

1034
02:10:19,309 --> 02:10:22,039
But today I won't take it!

1035
02:10:22,846 --> 02:10:25,280
Will you beat me?

1036
02:10:26,416 --> 02:10:28,577
I won't hold my hand back
if the need arises!

1037
02:10:29,252 --> 02:10:33,086
Lift your hand! Hit me!

1038
02:10:40,363 --> 02:10:41,295
You hit me!

1039
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:45,599
Go away or it will be calamitous!

1040
02:10:46,002 --> 02:10:47,993
It won't be calamitous!
The calamity has occurred!

1041
02:10:48,605 --> 02:10:52,268
- I won't let you take the temple
- I'll see how you stop me!

1042
02:11:02,552 --> 02:11:04,076
Let go!

1043
02:11:26,876 --> 02:11:28,104
You'll hit your brother!

1044
02:11:54,270 --> 02:11:56,261
Leave Lakhan alone!

1045
02:11:58,007 --> 02:11:59,804
You're bound by your mother!

1046
02:12:03,079 --> 02:12:04,774
For your mother's sake!

1047
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:08,642
Drown yourselves!

1048
02:12:09,819 --> 02:12:12,117
Your mother has gone thousands
of miles away on a pilgrimage!

1049
02:12:12,522 --> 02:12:16,481
To ask God for a boon of love
for you! For unity and success!

1050
02:12:17,193 --> 02:12:21,254
And here, you have
turned into enemies!

1051
02:12:22,031 --> 02:12:23,328
That too in front of her temple!

1052
02:12:27,837 --> 02:12:29,270
Give it a thought!

1053
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:34,271
If you can't think of yourself,
think about mother!

1054
02:12:35,945 --> 02:12:38,311
Where must she be?
What must she be doing?

1055
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:13,239
The Lord of Lords!

1056
02:13:14,517 --> 02:13:19,181
Just as you gave Lord Rama
and Laxman the boon...

1057
02:13:19,522 --> 02:13:24,186
...of courage and strength
to destroy the demons.

1058
02:13:25,395 --> 02:13:29,422
Give my Ram and Lakhan
the same boon

1059
02:13:30,233 --> 02:13:35,136
So that I can offer my
husband's remains to the Ganges.

1060
02:13:35,538 --> 02:13:37,665
And fulfill my pledge!

1061
02:13:45,915 --> 02:13:50,579
Tomorrow is going to be
a terrible night for all of us!

1062
02:13:52,588 --> 02:13:55,284
We will need you.

1063
02:13:56,225 --> 02:14:01,390
Our goods worth 51 crores will be
unloaded at the Dinapur border.

1064
02:14:02,765 --> 02:14:08,397
And Lakhan and his men will
mislead the Border Security Force.

1065
02:14:09,238 --> 02:14:13,937
So Sir John has decided to give you
5 crores for doing this job.

1066
02:14:15,244 --> 02:14:17,769
You can enjoy your life with this.

1067
02:14:18,181 --> 02:14:20,945
Put your heart into this last dive!

1068
02:14:21,751 --> 02:14:24,743
One should have a heart
in his chest to do so.

1069
02:14:25,388 --> 02:14:29,791
I mean my heart is
in your partner's fist.

1070
02:14:30,860 --> 02:14:33,090
Tell him to open his fist.

1071
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:36,064
And return my heart, my love.

1072
02:14:37,066 --> 02:14:40,524
Sure. But who is your love?

1073
02:14:41,204 --> 02:14:47,609
The name of my love is...

1074
02:14:52,682 --> 02:14:54,172
Lakhan is our hero.

1075
02:14:55,284 --> 02:15:00,722
Hurting him now means
we'll hurt our own business.

1076
02:15:01,023 --> 02:15:02,786
No harm in promising.

1077
02:15:05,061 --> 02:15:09,964
All right sir.
We accept if you say so.

1078
02:15:11,834 --> 02:15:14,302
But our promise will only be kept...

1079
02:15:14,971 --> 02:15:18,737
...when our contraband reaches
Surya Mansion in Dinapur.

1080
02:15:21,077 --> 02:15:24,478
Yes, Surya Mansion.

1081
02:15:25,014 --> 02:15:28,245
The one next to the railway line.
There is its' picture.

1082
02:15:40,696 --> 02:15:43,995
Why did the smile on your face
vanish on seeing the picture?

1083
02:15:45,768 --> 02:15:49,704
Now only Bishambar uncle can
return my smile to me.

1084
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:51,538
How is that?

1085
02:15:52,308 --> 02:15:54,902
Sir I don't want money in
return for tomorrow's job.

1086
02:15:55,244 --> 02:15:57,974
I want something else.

1087
02:16:00,082 --> 02:16:03,108
Your pen, Bibiya's blank paper.

1088
02:16:03,452 --> 02:16:07,013
And Bishambar uncle's signature.

1089
02:16:07,690 --> 02:16:09,214
Signature? For what?

1090
02:16:09,659 --> 02:16:15,825
Surya Mansion will be mine
from the day after tomorrow.

1091
02:16:17,033 --> 02:16:17,965
How dare you!

1092
02:16:20,136 --> 02:16:22,400
This house is in ruins.

1093
02:16:22,872 --> 02:16:24,601
It's not a ruin!

1094
02:16:26,042 --> 02:16:28,943
It's the sweat and blood of
my father and grandfather!

1095
02:16:29,478 --> 02:16:32,845
- My mother's dream!
- You won't get it at any price!

1096
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:35,317
And I want it at any cost!

1097
02:16:35,785 --> 02:16:37,980
- What are you saying?
- I'm making a deal.

1098
02:16:38,521 --> 02:16:40,079
We're giving you 5 crores!

1099
02:16:40,756 --> 02:16:43,725
I don't want 5 crores.
I only want this house!

1100
02:16:46,896 --> 02:16:49,296
Sit down, we'll sit and decide.

1101
02:16:50,700 --> 02:16:53,635
You will also get the mansion.

1102
02:16:53,970 --> 02:16:55,369
That's my property sir!

1103
02:16:55,905 --> 02:17:01,036
People who sell diamonds don't
care for the cost of wood.

1104
02:17:02,411 --> 02:17:03,435
Give him that ruin.

1105
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:07,347
Give him paper for the signature.

1106
02:17:12,922 --> 02:17:13,650
Sign it.

1107
02:17:17,159 --> 02:17:22,461
Lakhan will get this paper
only when we get our stuff.

1108
02:17:24,634 --> 02:17:25,532
Is the deal okay?

1109
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:33,064
I will definitely answer the
game that rascal played with us!

1110
02:17:34,477 --> 02:17:39,176
Watch how I make him play!

1111
02:17:46,422 --> 02:17:48,014
They've come from the
CBI department, from Delhi.

1112
02:17:48,391 --> 02:17:53,419
I'm Bedi, CBI officer.
We have urgent matters to discuss.

1113
02:17:57,366 --> 02:17:59,027
You didn't go to the
station to pick up mother.

1114
02:17:59,669 --> 02:18:00,966
No, Lakhan has gone.

1115
02:18:11,881 --> 02:18:17,046
- How are you mother?
- I'm fine.

1116
02:18:18,521 --> 02:18:21,957
Do you know what boons
I've asked for both of you?

1117
02:18:25,728 --> 02:18:26,558
Where is Ram?

1118
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:32,797
He's been put on some duty.
I'll get your luggage. Let's go.

1119
02:18:33,602 --> 02:18:35,229
Bring mother's luggage in.

1120
02:18:35,638 --> 02:18:39,802
- Where are we going?
- Come in mother.

1121
02:18:46,949 --> 02:18:48,416
Where have you brought me son?

1122
02:18:48,784 --> 02:18:50,411
- Home.
- Home?

1123
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:53,447
Your house, our house.

1124
02:18:55,558 --> 02:18:58,618
Bring some orange juice for mother.

1125
02:19:02,465 --> 02:19:03,864
But where is Ram?

1126
02:19:07,303 --> 02:19:09,771
Sit down mother. You are tired.

1127
02:19:10,473 --> 02:19:14,500
Have a bath. I've installed a hot
water machine in the bathroom.

1128
02:19:15,778 --> 02:19:17,473
I asked where Ram is.

1129
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:24,777
He's in his house.

1130
02:19:25,588 --> 02:19:29,217
- The old house?
- Yes mother.

1131
02:19:31,193 --> 02:19:37,189
Now brother and I have
decided to live separately.

1132
02:19:47,476 --> 02:19:52,345
Someday we have to be separated.

1133
02:19:53,716 --> 02:19:56,378
We did so today instead of tomorrow

1134
02:19:59,422 --> 02:20:06,726
You had promised me that when we
split, you'll always be with me.

1135
02:20:09,598 --> 02:20:12,328
Has the house been made or split?

1136
02:20:13,502 --> 02:20:17,461
This building, destroying...
is all in brother's hands.

1137
02:20:18,207 --> 02:20:20,869
For no reason he got angry
with me, lost his temper!

1138
02:20:21,143 --> 02:20:25,011
- Why?
- Why? Because I'm a police officer!

1139
02:20:26,449 --> 02:20:29,748
And I started earning money
soon as I become an officer.

1140
02:20:30,486 --> 02:20:32,420
I even won a lottery!

1141
02:20:33,355 --> 02:20:35,721
I became rich. And that's no crime!

1142
02:20:36,725 --> 02:20:40,058
Whatever I am today is
because of my hard work.

1143
02:20:40,796 --> 02:20:43,822
I played footsie with the world
and kept earning money!

1144
02:21:25,608 --> 02:21:30,204
Have this orange juice.

1145
02:21:34,817 --> 02:21:40,084
First of all I want to meet Ram.

1146
02:21:42,858 --> 02:21:48,057
- First drink this.
- I said I want to meet Ram first.

1147
02:21:53,135 --> 02:21:55,968
You will come back after seeing him?

1148
02:21:56,972 --> 02:22:00,032
Yes. I will come.

1149
02:22:02,545 --> 02:22:04,410
He can be arrested at any time.

1150
02:22:08,250 --> 02:22:12,778
But it's better if you stay with him.

1151
02:22:15,391 --> 02:22:16,824
He loves you a lot.

1152
02:22:18,994 --> 02:22:25,900
And you too have always
loved him more than me.

1153
02:22:28,137 --> 02:22:33,131
Doesn't matter if
we couldn't get along.

1154
02:22:33,475 --> 02:22:34,737
You will get along.

1155
02:22:36,412 --> 02:22:37,674
You are a mother.

1156
02:22:39,248 --> 02:22:40,306
Yes I know mother...

1157
02:22:42,151 --> 02:22:44,415
I know I'm your heart.

1158
02:22:46,055 --> 02:22:47,579
But I also know that...

1159
02:22:48,557 --> 02:22:52,015
Lakhan is your heartbeat.

1160
02:22:53,195 --> 02:22:55,595
Of what use is just the heart?

1161
02:22:59,268 --> 02:23:00,496
Where is the temple?

1162
02:23:06,308 --> 02:23:10,802
Take me to Lakhan.

1163
02:23:12,681 --> 02:23:15,673
Yes, I want to go to Lakhan.

1164
02:23:46,482 --> 02:23:47,710
Now what are you waiting for?

1165
02:23:50,219 --> 02:23:51,277
Nothing at all.

1166
02:24:01,430 --> 02:24:03,261
Mother has already given her decision.

1167
02:24:05,801 --> 02:24:09,259
If you wish you too
can come to this house.

1168
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:20,714
- No!
- Mother!

1169
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:27,882
Move aside Ram! I hold you by oath!

1170
02:24:34,396 --> 02:24:39,095
No! No!

1171
02:25:01,690 --> 02:25:04,454
This is not the result of my penance!

1172
02:25:05,461 --> 02:25:06,826
This is not justice!

1173
02:25:07,663 --> 02:25:10,029
This is injustice, not justice!

1174
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:14,230
This is not what I'd asked for!

1175
02:25:15,003 --> 02:25:18,666
I'd wanted a war with
Bishambar and Bhanu.

1176
02:25:19,308 --> 02:25:21,435
Not between Ram and Lakhan!

1177
02:25:22,644 --> 02:25:25,408
Ram and Lakhan were my weapons.

1178
02:25:26,448 --> 02:25:28,848
And you broke my weapons!

1179
02:25:30,152 --> 02:25:33,883
Lakhan who is my own son!

1180
02:25:34,990 --> 02:25:37,652
And you cut away a part of my heart!

1181
02:25:38,293 --> 02:25:41,126
You cut a mother's heart!

1182
02:25:46,668 --> 02:25:51,105
Have mercy on me Lord!

1183
02:25:52,174 --> 02:25:55,200
Have mercy on a grief-stricken woman!

1184
02:26:11,460 --> 02:26:19,299
Your mortal remains...
will they never...

1185
02:26:19,701 --> 02:26:24,331
...be immersed in the Ganges?

1186
02:27:13,155 --> 02:27:20,425
Will your mortal remains never
be immersed in the Ganges?

1187
02:27:32,207 --> 02:27:35,643
These bones are the mortal remains
of my husband Thakur Pratap Singh.

1188
02:27:36,111 --> 02:27:41,378
He was murdered before my eyes
by Bishambar and Bhanu.

1189
02:28:08,143 --> 02:28:10,668
He is Kuldeep Bedi from
The Delhi CBI Department.

1190
02:28:11,246 --> 02:28:13,874
There are some charges on you.

1191
02:28:15,284 --> 02:28:16,546
Hence you are under arrest.

1192
02:28:17,886 --> 02:28:19,319
Here is your arrest warrant.

1193
02:28:27,062 --> 02:28:27,653
Come on.

1194
02:28:33,568 --> 02:28:37,197
Call him sir!

1195
02:28:37,773 --> 02:28:40,708
Called us home for dinner
and going out on duty?

1196
02:28:41,243 --> 02:28:42,369
Do me a favor.

1197
02:28:43,378 --> 02:28:46,040
Give mother's temple back to her.

1198
02:28:46,815 --> 02:28:52,219
And tell her Lakhan will return
only after completing your pledge!

1199
02:28:53,355 --> 02:28:58,759
Forgive me but mother's pledge
is more important than your duty!

1200
02:28:59,428 --> 02:29:01,919
Walk me till there.

1201
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:08,830
I promise to come to you
after I finish my job.

1202
02:29:11,173 --> 02:29:12,606
Stop!

1203
02:29:14,643 --> 02:29:16,406
What are you saying?
Follow him!

1204
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:21,274
What are you saying?
He'll be ruined this way.

1205
02:29:22,050 --> 02:29:24,450
And where's Ram? I'm on my way.

1206
02:29:28,156 --> 02:29:30,556
- What's the matter?
- Lakhan ran away from police custody.

1207
02:29:30,892 --> 02:29:33,986
Stupid boy! Ram is worried so am I.

1208
02:29:35,464 --> 02:29:40,595
The fool says his mother's pledge
is more important than police duty!

1209
02:30:01,957 --> 02:30:04,187
Welcome my nephew!

1210
02:30:06,328 --> 02:30:07,295
You are warmly welcomed.

1211
02:30:11,199 --> 02:30:13,690
Come in. Sir John is waiting for you.

1212
02:30:36,024 --> 02:30:37,355
The mines are laid
all around the mansion.

1213
02:30:39,995 --> 02:30:42,429
Both of you go home.

1214
02:30:53,175 --> 02:30:54,164
What's going on?

1215
02:31:02,718 --> 02:31:05,050
What's all this sir?

1216
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:08,150
This is in your honor.

1217
02:31:09,124 --> 02:31:12,150
You've taken the cash.
And you'll get this mansion.

1218
02:31:12,627 --> 02:31:15,323
As well as the queen of your dreams!

1219
02:31:15,697 --> 02:31:17,858
She'll come breezing in.

1220
02:31:18,767 --> 02:31:21,395
But do you remember your promise?

1221
02:31:22,070 --> 02:31:26,404
You have to take our trucks across
the border before the sun rises.

1222
02:31:28,176 --> 02:31:29,438
Yes sir. I am ready.

1223
02:31:29,945 --> 02:31:32,345
Give him his uniform.

1224
02:31:40,622 --> 02:31:41,884
I'll go without my uniform.

1225
02:31:43,024 --> 02:31:44,582
Because everybody there recognizes me.

1226
02:31:44,926 --> 02:31:47,451
There will be no fun
without the uniform.

1227
02:31:48,430 --> 02:31:50,227
- But sir I...
- Wear the uniform.

1228
02:31:55,003 --> 02:31:58,803
Now I can't wear this uniform.

1229
02:32:01,476 --> 02:32:04,104
Don't play games with me.
Wear the uniform.

1230
02:32:04,613 --> 02:32:05,841
Wear it son.

1231
02:32:07,082 --> 02:32:10,313
- Wear the uniform.
- Wear it bad man.

1232
02:32:10,919 --> 02:32:11,851
I said I won't wear it.

1233
02:32:12,354 --> 02:32:15,050
- Wear it.
- I said I won't wear it!

1234
02:32:16,958 --> 02:32:19,153
Son wear the uniform!

1235
02:32:25,233 --> 02:32:26,962
So you won't wear the uniform!

1236
02:32:28,303 --> 02:32:29,133
You won't wear it?

1237
02:32:34,609 --> 02:32:35,769
Even your Pop will wear it!

1238
02:32:36,645 --> 02:32:37,669
You will have to wear it!

1239
02:32:41,449 --> 02:32:44,009
They know that the
police is behind you.

1240
02:32:44,553 --> 02:32:47,522
Also why you have come here!
Why did you tell lies?

1241
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:57,726
He too has failed.

1242
02:32:58,433 --> 02:33:01,061
So we'll have to pass him too.

1243
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:03,497
Before that...

1244
02:33:04,005 --> 02:33:09,238
At least let him see the
queen of his dreams once.

1245
02:33:12,347 --> 02:33:15,009
Sure. Why not?

1246
02:33:31,132 --> 02:33:33,100
Congratulations.

1247
02:33:33,735 --> 02:33:36,465
Best wishes on your fifth wedding.

1248
02:33:37,706 --> 02:33:41,938
This is a beautiful present
from us for you.

1249
02:33:44,613 --> 02:33:47,173
Bastard! Scoundrel!

1250
02:33:53,688 --> 02:33:54,416
Beat the rascal!

1251
02:33:57,726 --> 02:33:59,318
Beat the living daylights out of him!

1252
02:34:07,903 --> 02:34:11,839
My brother has committed crimes
but somebody else is behind it.

1253
02:34:12,641 --> 02:34:16,372
Yes, a conspiracy. You have seen
the plant but the root is elsewhere.

1254
02:34:20,148 --> 02:34:21,137
Sir John here.

1255
02:34:22,751 --> 02:34:25,379
Your brother is with us,
pleading for his life.

1256
02:34:26,221 --> 02:34:29,987
We thought the job that Lakhan
couldn't complete will be done by Ram.

1257
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:33,086
You can save your
brother's life if you wish.

1258
02:34:34,029 --> 02:34:35,963
My men will explain everything to you.

1259
02:34:37,098 --> 02:34:41,797
You will come alone to check post
number 7. You means only you.

1260
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:45,603
So now we have to work with the
scare of Sir John's threats!

1261
02:34:45,907 --> 02:34:47,807
The entire police department
is put to shame like this.

1262
02:34:48,043 --> 02:34:49,806
This will never happen.

1263
02:34:50,745 --> 02:34:53,213
Does this mean we leave
Lakhan there, to die?

1264
02:34:54,082 --> 02:34:56,312
- Are you in your senses?
- What else do we do?

1265
02:34:56,851 --> 02:35:00,378
- Do we bend before them?
- Yes. Ram will have to bend.

1266
02:35:01,289 --> 02:35:03,689
Because I know Lakhan is his life.

1267
02:35:04,259 --> 02:35:06,659
And Ram can't live without Lakhan.

1268
02:35:07,062 --> 02:35:09,462
I'll stay without him.
I'll manage to survive!

1269
02:35:10,265 --> 02:35:13,257
Will he test me each time?
Give me sorrow?

1270
02:35:14,402 --> 02:35:15,664
I'll live without him.

1271
02:35:31,953 --> 02:35:35,684
You didn't believe what I said.
Now see it for yourself.

1272
02:35:38,526 --> 02:35:40,460
It's just love.

1273
02:35:42,230 --> 02:35:44,755
Lakhan will marry Bibiya.

1274
02:35:50,338 --> 02:35:52,329
It's been 9 hours
since they took Radha.

1275
02:35:52,774 --> 02:35:54,366
- Who took her?
- Bishambar and Debu.

1276
02:35:55,276 --> 02:35:59,679
They said they want to show her
birth chart to some holy man.

1277
02:35:59,981 --> 02:36:02,176
I think they pulled
wool over your eyes.

1278
02:36:02,584 --> 02:36:05,985
Tell him about Lakhan.

1279
02:36:06,821 --> 02:36:11,918
Before you do any drama
in tonight's party...

1280
02:36:13,061 --> 02:36:15,529
I ask you for the last time.

1281
02:36:16,798 --> 02:36:19,323
Do you object to marrying me?

1282
02:36:24,639 --> 02:36:27,631
No. I accept.

1283
02:36:30,045 --> 02:36:30,943
But on one condition.

1284
02:36:34,215 --> 02:36:37,878
You'll have to bring Lakhan before
me just once before the wedding.

1285
02:36:38,887 --> 02:36:42,516
- Why?
- Will you have him freed?

1286
02:36:42,991 --> 02:36:44,288
Or killed?

1287
02:36:46,194 --> 02:36:48,059
You'll get the answer only then.

1288
02:36:52,434 --> 02:36:53,799
The game will be interesting.

1289
02:36:54,069 --> 02:37:00,304
Ram will have our cocaine
taken out of the border today.

1290
02:37:00,909 --> 02:37:05,369
Till then you hear the wedding drums!

1291
02:42:14,989 --> 02:42:16,786
- Where's my Lakhan?
- What did you say?

1292
02:42:17,725 --> 02:42:19,556
Sharda has taken both
of them to Lakhan?

1293
02:42:20,528 --> 02:42:24,020
- Now she'll kill them all!
- No, she can't.

1294
02:42:24,665 --> 02:42:28,192
- How?
- If you do as we say.

1295
02:42:29,537 --> 02:42:33,769
I've done your job. As per your
word, now tell me where Lakhan is.

1296
02:42:35,910 --> 02:42:37,275
Wait.

1297
02:42:38,646 --> 02:42:42,946
- Who cheated me?
- This is my childhood habit.

1298
02:42:48,890 --> 02:42:50,824
Sir we're on our way.

1299
02:46:18,666 --> 02:46:20,759
- A shot has been fired!
- Stop this nonsense!

1300
02:46:21,235 --> 02:46:21,826
Stop the band.

1301
02:46:23,804 --> 02:46:24,771
What nonsense is this?

1302
02:46:25,973 --> 02:46:29,568
- Problem.
- What problem?

1303
02:46:31,245 --> 02:46:32,109
Are you all right?

1304
02:46:34,715 --> 02:46:35,773
What drama is this?

1305
02:46:36,984 --> 02:46:42,752
Tell him what will happen if
we tell him about the drama.

1306
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:45,850
They will break out in sweat,
do it in their pants, like you!

1307
02:46:46,660 --> 02:46:49,788
Don't tell them.
Swear by me, you won't.

1308
02:46:50,064 --> 02:46:51,759
No my child.

1309
02:46:52,633 --> 02:46:56,694
My heart says I should
give them a warning.

1310
02:46:58,906 --> 02:47:04,742
Brother, don't let blood...
don't let your blood boil!

1311
02:47:07,415 --> 02:47:08,814
Come here.

1312
02:47:11,018 --> 02:47:13,009
In front of everyone
tell us the warning.

1313
02:47:14,555 --> 02:47:15,317
Who is he?

1314
02:47:16,590 --> 02:47:17,648
He is my friend.

1315
02:47:19,226 --> 02:47:20,454
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1316
02:47:21,162 --> 02:47:22,652
But he looks like a smuggler.

1317
02:47:23,931 --> 02:47:28,868
If you're his friend,
explain to him...

1318
02:47:29,170 --> 02:47:31,138
...not to pick bones with smugglers!

1319
02:47:31,906 --> 02:47:37,310
- Which smuggler?
- Some squint-eyed rascal Sir John.

1320
02:47:38,379 --> 02:47:42,008
I'm going to be related to you,
so I've come to explain to you.

1321
02:47:42,550 --> 02:47:45,678
Don't play the game you
plan to with Sir John.

1322
02:47:46,020 --> 02:47:47,578
- We'll all be ruined!
- What game?

1323
02:47:48,089 --> 02:47:51,547
Let me tell him everything.
He is your friend, isn't he?

1324
02:47:52,093 --> 02:47:56,029
He'll pretend to get my daughter
married to Sir John but all false.

1325
02:47:56,430 --> 02:47:58,625
And then Sir John will be killed!

1326
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:03,728
You tell me has Sir John worn
bangles? He too will rise in revolt!

1327
02:48:04,138 --> 02:48:06,163
And he'll hit you first
as you're his friend!

1328
02:48:06,307 --> 02:48:09,470
And then you because you're
his friend. And then me too!

1329
02:48:10,010 --> 02:48:12,843
Don't ' Devdhar' me! I won't let
you kill that bastard Sir John!

1330
02:48:14,014 --> 02:48:15,242
This is Sir John.

1331
02:48:17,618 --> 02:48:19,347
Sir John is a great scoundrel!

1332
02:48:19,653 --> 02:48:20,915
- Sir!
- He's a dog!

1333
02:48:21,288 --> 02:48:23,950
- He's a fool! And squint-eyed!
- Master!

1334
02:48:24,458 --> 02:48:28,019
What, ' master! ' It's our duty
to save the lives of relatives.

1335
02:48:28,529 --> 02:48:30,861
I won't let him murder Sir John!

1336
02:48:31,432 --> 02:48:33,297
Murder? Who will murder me?

1337
02:48:33,934 --> 02:48:36,994
Nobody is murdering you.
I mean Sir John's murder.

1338
02:48:37,771 --> 02:48:40,262
That blind man with a stone eye!

1339
02:48:40,608 --> 02:48:43,839
I am he!

1340
02:49:01,128 --> 02:49:02,254
The player had feet of clay.

1341
02:49:02,997 --> 02:49:06,091
- Listen...
- Shut up you fool!

1342
02:49:09,803 --> 02:49:12,465
Priest, begin the marriage ceremony.

1343
02:49:12,773 --> 02:49:13,671
Put tilak to the groom.

1344
02:49:18,946 --> 02:49:20,971
Now it's my turn Sir John!

1345
02:49:21,882 --> 02:49:24,180
- Devdhar Shastri.
- Long live!

1346
02:49:29,456 --> 02:49:33,722
That's wonderful! You look
just like James Bond!

1347
02:49:34,328 --> 02:49:36,660
You haven't recognized me.

1348
02:49:37,264 --> 02:49:40,097
The lion whom other lions fear.

1349
02:49:40,834 --> 02:49:42,734
His name is Devdhar.

1350
02:49:44,238 --> 02:49:47,264
This is the time for action
not dialogues.

1351
02:49:47,741 --> 02:49:50,301
- Action one.
- Bring Lakhan here.

1352
02:49:50,778 --> 02:49:52,643
- Action two.
- Send Radha with us.

1353
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:54,877
I'll say the next.

1354
02:49:55,749 --> 02:50:00,277
Your story finishes here
and my story begins.

1355
02:50:01,322 --> 02:50:08,592
Hunting lions is neither a
grocer's job nor his destiny!

1356
02:50:09,630 --> 02:50:10,221
Look here.

1357
02:50:13,567 --> 02:50:17,503
If anybody moves an inch,
Radha will be blown to smithereens!

1358
02:50:18,539 --> 02:50:25,707
You did play your hand
but not with finesse.

1359
02:51:19,366 --> 02:51:24,895
See who is standing before you.

1360
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:27,737
Your death!

1361
02:51:28,809 --> 02:51:31,175
Who has come at the appointed hour!

1362
02:51:32,079 --> 02:51:37,016
This is the mother of that Ram
whose brother you snatched away!

1363
02:51:38,952 --> 02:51:44,584
This is the mother of Lakhan whom
you threw down the drain of corruption

1364
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:47,554
This is the wife of
Thakur Pratap Singh.

1365
02:51:48,062 --> 02:51:52,260
Whose stains of blood are
still on my clothes!

1366
02:51:54,635 --> 02:51:56,159
Can you see these stains?

1367
02:51:56,904 --> 02:52:02,365
Can't you see them?
Then here, have a look!

1368
02:52:12,386 --> 02:52:15,549
Take Radha away.

1369
02:52:21,695 --> 02:52:25,426
Where is my Lakhan?

1370
02:52:33,674 --> 02:52:35,869
Find the old woman! And kill her!

1371
02:52:42,649 --> 02:52:44,241
No sound.

1372
02:52:54,128 --> 02:52:54,594
Who?

1373
02:52:59,199 --> 02:53:03,465
- Did you bring the stuff?
- Kesariya never fails.

1374
02:53:05,172 --> 02:53:08,903
- Give me the money!
- No! Let it be there.

1375
02:53:09,643 --> 02:53:12,203
Mother, wait here.
I'll go and look for Lakhan.

1376
02:53:13,514 --> 02:53:15,277
First tell me who
switched off the lights?

1377
02:53:15,883 --> 02:53:22,345
If I wouldn't switch off the
lights, all of you would be fused!

1378
02:53:23,357 --> 02:53:25,655
Brother-in-law, switch on the lights.

1379
02:53:27,461 --> 02:53:31,363
No! Crush the serpent in the dark!

1380
02:54:09,803 --> 02:54:11,270
You and here?

1381
02:54:12,039 --> 02:54:14,564
Wherever the devil, Ram will be found.

1382
02:54:57,618 --> 02:54:58,846
Here is mother's sari.

1383
02:55:00,754 --> 02:55:06,556
The color of whose blood
is spreading all around this house.

1384
02:55:08,162 --> 02:55:09,026
Take this.

1385
02:55:10,797 --> 02:55:13,732
Today you have to fight but remember...

1386
02:55:14,434 --> 02:55:18,768
Not as Lakhan, but as
Inspector Lakhan Pratap Singh!

1387
02:55:20,841 --> 02:55:23,173
Here is the paper of this mansion.

1388
02:55:25,212 --> 02:55:28,272
Our victory lies in yours.

1389
02:55:31,485 --> 02:55:34,352
But I will be victorious
in this game.

1390
02:55:55,342 --> 02:55:59,574
Death stands behind you!

1391
02:56:09,189 --> 02:56:14,627
You love to make me wear
my uniform? Now put it on me.

1392
02:56:26,740 --> 02:56:27,297
Come on!

1393
02:56:46,727 --> 02:56:48,126
Take mother out.

1394
02:56:50,264 --> 02:56:51,822
It's pitch dark outside.

1395
02:56:52,399 --> 02:56:54,299
- Where is Radha?
- She left with Shiva.

1396
02:56:59,106 --> 02:57:00,664
No!

1397
02:57:20,794 --> 02:57:22,352
Take Radha out.

1398
02:57:22,863 --> 02:57:25,491
Go and switch on the explosives.

1399
02:57:29,803 --> 02:57:33,762
Any sign of Lakhan?

1400
02:57:36,476 --> 02:57:38,569
Your Lakhan is alive.

1401
02:57:52,959 --> 02:57:53,653
These wounds?

1402
02:57:54,461 --> 02:57:59,228
The punishment for my deeds.

1403
02:58:01,968 --> 02:58:02,593
This uniform?

1404
02:58:04,071 --> 02:58:10,840
I now wish that when I die and
my brother gets my dead body...

1405
02:58:11,144 --> 02:58:12,839
It is of an honest inspector
Lakhan Pratap Singh!

1406
02:58:13,347 --> 02:58:17,681
And not of the cheat Lakhan
whom everyone was ashamed of!

1407
02:58:36,570 --> 02:58:38,765
See where your actions
brought all of us!

1408
02:58:40,407 --> 02:58:42,272
Is this what you wanted?

1409
02:58:45,045 --> 02:58:46,069
Were these your dreams?

1410
02:58:48,715 --> 02:58:50,046
You set off to change the world.

1411
02:58:52,719 --> 02:58:56,348
Stupid boy! You're saying sorry!

1412
02:59:06,833 --> 02:59:08,266
Go upstairs. I'll go down.

1413
02:59:14,808 --> 02:59:16,673
Blow up this mansion!

1414
02:59:28,989 --> 02:59:34,256
My son, Lakhan! I'm your uncle.

1415
02:59:35,095 --> 02:59:39,896
Uncle isn't this the room?

1416
02:59:40,367 --> 02:59:43,825
...from where you
dragged my mother out?

1417
02:59:44,704 --> 02:59:48,140
Come on! Now it's your turn!

1418
03:00:35,155 --> 03:00:39,387
Brother he's the devil
who killed our Dad!

1419
03:00:58,879 --> 03:01:02,371
Take us also.

1420
03:01:02,883 --> 03:01:07,149
You failed everything.
Now you think of me!

1421
03:01:11,958 --> 03:01:13,516
I'll get them back!

1422
03:01:23,570 --> 03:01:24,901
Surrender to the police!

1423
03:01:34,214 --> 03:01:36,614
Save her if you can.

1424
03:01:51,131 --> 03:01:52,826
Let them go.

1425
03:02:28,168 --> 03:02:30,466
Sir there's a message from the
mansion that Geeta has been kidnapped

1426
03:02:44,384 --> 03:02:48,718
Bring her here and tie her
to this same railway line.

1427
03:02:49,522 --> 03:02:52,184
Where we cut her husband to shreds!

1428
03:02:55,996 --> 03:02:58,988
Serpent! Out to sting us?

1429
03:03:16,483 --> 03:03:19,509
If you try to kill me,
keep this in mind...

1430
03:03:20,553 --> 03:03:24,649
You'll also get their dead bodies!

1431
03:03:25,725 --> 03:03:26,419
Stay put!

1432
03:03:47,747 --> 03:03:52,047
Stop. Surrender to the law.

1433
03:05:00,587 --> 03:05:01,554
You were right.

1434
03:05:02,889 --> 03:05:07,986
The ideals of Ramayana written
long ago have never changed.

1435
03:05:08,361 --> 03:05:10,522
Neither can we ever change them.

1436
03:05:16,703 --> 03:05:20,195
Do you know what I feel today?

1437
03:05:20,573 --> 03:05:24,942
I feel my Lakhan

1438
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:28,862
