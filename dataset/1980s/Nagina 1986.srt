Janardhan -Yes, madam

1
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,837
Why is this vase empty?
- I am just putting them in.

2
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:17,036
Decorate aII the fIower vases with fIowers
FIowers shouId be seen everywhere.

3
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,403
Don't worry. I wiII put them right now

4
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,647
Hey Chanda! -Yes?
My son is coming back from abroad.

5
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,487
He won't Iike aII these. Keep these inside.

6
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:29,126
And take out the bone china dinner-set from inside..

7
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:41,240
I just rememberthis smaII chiId. 15 years have passed.

8
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:45,047
And each year passed as if 15 ages have passed.

9
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:49,196
Sister-in-Iaw! What is this? You have tears in your eyes!

10
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:53,443
Today you shouId be happy. After 15 years your son..

11
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:54,283
is returning home. -Yes brother.

12
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:57,316
They are the tears of happiness.
I am a mother.

13
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,523
That is why I'm
Ionging to see my son.

14
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:05,482
You aIso did a strange thing !
God had given you onIy one son.

15
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:11,680
Mr. Raja is aIso no more. Even then, you kept
your son awayfrom yourseIf so many years

16
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:16,927
It was Mr. Raja's decision.
ActuaIIy, at the age of 6..

17
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:18,883
I don't know what happened
to Raju suddenIy!

18
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,202
He used to be scared at night and
used to get up...shouting in his sIeep

19
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,525
Then used to run out of the paIace!

20
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,476
Moreover, he used to get scared of his own shadow too!

21
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:31,124
Many doctors treated him

22
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:35,117
We aIso tried othertreatments But it was of no use!

23
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,957
Then one doctortoId us that if
he goes somewhere far away

24
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:42,165
from here, then maybe he wouId be aIright

25
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:46,324
Those days my brother had come from the U.S

26
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:52,278
That's it. With a heavy heart, I sent Raju with him.

27
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,240
After going there, he became aIright.

28
00:03:55,727 --> 00:04:00,881
And today, after compIeting his studies, he is
coming back after 15 years

29
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,727
Hasn't Vijaya come? - How can this be possibIe, aunt?

30
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:08,727
I have been here since a Iong time.
It was me who made the gardener pIuck..

31
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:09,047
I have been here since a Iong time.
It was me who made the gardener pIuck..
the fIowers and
make the bouquets.

32
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,639
the fIowers and
make the bouquets.

33
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:15,727
Even I was thinking that some beautifuI girI
must have onIy decorated such beautifuI fIowers!

34
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:15,767
Even I was thinking that some beautifuI girI
must have onIy decorated such beautifuI fIowers!
The young master has come, mistress.

35
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:16,995
The young master has come, mistress.

36
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,437
What? My son has come.

37
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:34,159

38
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:37,843

39

You have grown so much! Where have you Ieft my IittIe Raju?

40
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:50,403

sent me so far away

41
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:55,801
WeII said! Son, he is Mr. Ajay
Singh Yourfather's friend.

42
00:04:56,247 --> 00:04:59,205
After him, he has onIy taken
care of the entire business.

43
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,487

by him .and it's us who reap the benefits!

47
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,276

She has just finished her
studies from Shantiniketan.

50
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,837
She used to spend time with
me in her chiIdhood.

51
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:18,158
RecentIy when I was iII, she
reaIIy took a Iot of care of me...

52
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:20,642

64
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:00,647

I wiII get one bottIe.
And my wife wiII get one bottIe.

66
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,403
Mr. Munshi, why did you
carry this Iuggage?

67
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,607
Where are the servants? - They have gone to carry
the oId Iuggage. I don't I get to carry such new..

68
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:11,807
Where are the servants? - They have gone to carry
the oId Iuggage. I don't I get to carry such new..
and shining Iuggage !
- Mr. Munshi, it is very heavy.

69
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:12,842
and shining Iuggage !
- Mr. Munshi, it is very heavy.

70
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,876
I have the habit of carrying weight 10 times

71
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,447
greaterthan this. - Ok, Mr. Munshi, so
it means that you..do weight Iifting !

72
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:19,927
greaterthan this. - Ok, Mr. Munshi, so
it means that you..do weight Iifting !
No. I do wife Iifting.

73
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:22,077
No. I do wife Iifting.

74
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:27,161
Wife Iifting? - Bringing up
a fat wife is not Iess than..

75
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,966
weight Iifting. - So Mr. Munshi, you
consider yourwife..as a burden?

76
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:33,244
Not a burden,
my chiId. Weight Iifting.

77
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:37,639
It so happened that one day, a
sIim and trim, attractive woman...

78
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,599
was waiting for a bus.

79
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,764
I was traveIIing by Queen
mother's car and snoring away.

80
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,486
I gave that waiting
girI Iift in the car.

81
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,916
This weight Iifting
turned into Iove.

82
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:53,127
Love turned into marriage.
And my wife Bhanumati..

83
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:53,487
Love turned into marriage.
And my wife Bhanumati..
started becoming fat. She
bIoated up Iike an eIephant.

84
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,559
started becoming fat. She
bIoated up Iike an eIephant.

85
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:59,480
In oIden days, the kings and
emperors used to tie..

86
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,564
eIephants in their courtyard. I tied
a she-eIephant in my own house.

87
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:07,606
Even today, I have to take 10
kiIos of sweets. That too..'motichoor Iaddoo

88
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,606
Bhanumati has set up her home..in such a haphazard way !

89
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:13,480
Where did I go and
break my head?

90
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,287
Ok, sister-in-Iaw. We wiII Ieave now.
- Ok brother.

91
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:17,687
Ok, sister-in-Iaw. We wiII Ieave now.
- Ok brother.
Ok aunty.

92
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,358
Ok aunty.

93
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:22,082
Leave Vijaya here onIy. Tomorrow
when Raju comes there..he wiII drop her.

94
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:27,287
As you wish ! Ok Raju.
- Ok daddy.

95
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,681
Why did you choose
onIy Shantiniketan for...your studies?

96
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:35,678
From the beginning itseIf, I was
interested in music and art

97
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:40,119
And where otherthan..Shantiniketan
couId I get both these things?

98
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,199
Ok. ShaII I ask you one thing?
-Yes.

99
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:47,407
15 years is not a very short
time. After spending so..

100
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:47,767
15 years is not a very short
time. After spending so..
many years in London,
how come you decided..to return?

101
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,998
many years in London,
how come you decided..to return?

102
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,879
This I had decided from the beginning
itseIf, that after

103
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,202
hat after compIeting my studies, I wiII return to my country.

104
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,722
To my house, to my mother.

105
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:03,121
TeII me, that the tree
which has it's roots here..

106
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:07,962
how can it bIoom
far away? -You are right.

107
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:11,801
Mother, father, you. Finding
so many of your own peopIe..

108
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,685
even I am forgetting
Shantiniketan sIowIy.

109
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,923
That means you are not
pIanning to do M.A.

110
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:20,437
If you teII me to, I wiII
definiteIy do it. I have.. .

111
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:23,885
Raju, it's too Iate at
night. Come inside.

112
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:24,797
Let's go.

113
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,522
You had gone for horse riding
earIy in the morning?

114
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,115
Yes. I am very fond of riding.
Are you aIso fond of it?

115
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:10,559
No.

116
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:22,402
The vehicIes are ready, master. -Yes.
Mr. Munshi, what is this caravan?

117
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:27,047
Master, what does this man
know that which vehicIe..does the rider Iike?

118
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:27,207
Master, what does this man
know that which vehicIe..does the rider Iike?
In the morning, you
had gone on horseback.

119
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:28,686
In the morning, you
had gone on horseback.

120
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,240
These are horses made of iron.

121
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:34,320
This is an open-air horse..

122
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,927
just Iike fIying
in a fIying chariot.

No one can catch it ! PIease come.

125
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:43,716
This is a jeep. A hunter's vehicIe.
CIimbs mountains and..surges ahead !

126
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,367
And this an ambassador.

00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:49,687
And this an ambassador.
Mother's ambassador!
And many ghosts

128
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,598
And many ghosts
are scared of it !

129
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:56,927
And this is Maruti. The son of
the wind. It goes Iike the wind.

130
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:03,243
And this is the Victoria beIonging to
Queen Victoria's era.Victoria No. 203.

131
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:06,484
I had searched for a diamond
in it. But I didn't get it.

132
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,405
You may Iook for it.
Maybe you'II get it.

133
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:13,163
Mr, Munshi, I have traveIed a Iot in
cars. This wiII be something unusuaI!

134
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:16,046
Ms. Vijaya, wouId you Iike

135
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:21,239
I am ready to go with you

136
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:22,965
Let me cIimb up.

137
00:10:24,287 --> 00:10:24,878
Wow!

Such a beautifuI weather.
Such a beautifuI journey.

139
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,484
The companion is beautifuI.
Even the horses know this.

140

00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:39,276
It so happened that a
snake tried to bite him.

164
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:43,207
It was good that he had worn
Iong boots. Otherwise..

165
00:13:43,207 --> 00:13:43,607
It was good that he had worn
Iong boots. Otherwise..
..I don't know what wouId

172
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,478
These girIs can't even keep

173
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:00,241
Such smaII incidents keep
happening in Iife.

174
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,085
Now you onIy teII me that

186
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:44,685
Oh! Come on, mom! It's nothing
Iike that. You don't worry.

187
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:50,363
Mr. Munshi, caII up Mr. Ajay Singh.

188
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:51,516
car and take Raju and
Vijaya with him.

189
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:56,802
Son, the farms that you can see
aII spreading out in the distance...

190
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:01,722
..aII those beIong to you. And that
one. That factory is the sugarfactory.

191
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,725
That too is yours. Since the
Iast many years we have been..

192
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:08,727
getting awards from the government for..
.the highest production of sugar.- Look at this.

193
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:09,087
getting awards from the government for..
.the highest production of sugar.- Look at this.
But since the Iast 2 years,
the production decreased

194
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:12,397
But since the Iast 2 years,
the production decreased

195
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,156
very much. Last year it did not rain. And this year..

196
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,681
..the insects ate away
the sugarcane crop.

197
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:20,601
What is yourfauIt in it ? As it
is, you have done so many..

198
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:22,399
favors for us that it is
difficuIt to repay you.

199
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,604
No son. It was my duty. Now
since you have come, you can..

200
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,607
.take care of your business.

00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:24,002
This driver does not check
whetherthere is water..in the car or not.

221
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:02,042
Today when I saw those ruins,
I feIt something strange.

222
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:08,561
I feIt as if an unknown thing was puIIing me towards it
With which I have a deep reIationship.

223
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:13,004
I didn't even come to know when my feet took me there.

224
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:17,007
ActuaIIy, there was no one
there. But I couId hearthe..

that I feIt that someone was..waIking with me.

227
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,047
Maybe
it is my imagination but then..

228
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:24,367
Maybe
it is my imagination but then..

278
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:23,077
Don't you remember anything?
-What are you saying?

279
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:25,206
I don't understand anything.

280
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:27,320

00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,717
No, no. It's dead.

293
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:04,884
What's the matter?

294

297
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:31,522
and went to
an unknown worId.

298
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:34,557
Where everything
was new for you.

299
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:40,367
But I had onIy this pIace with

For me, time stopped where it was..

303
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:46,961
For me, time stopped where it was..

304
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:51,276
As time passes, oId
memories can sureIy fade..

305
00:28:52,407 --> 00:28:53,760

But why are you asking this?

593
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,607
the circumstances were such that
I had to transferthe entire property.

in my name because you
had ordered me to so

596
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:28,281
But even then, I had signed
a document which said that..

597
00:47:28,607 --> 00:47:30,120
that in spite of this IegaI action..

601
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,961
WeII ! Hey! Its so Iate

Very good! Today I won't
Iet you go away so easiIy.

614
00:48:39,047 --> 00:48:41,561
Today is a very big day in our Iives.

615
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:49,483
When you go home..mother

618
00:48:55,447 --> 00:49:00,567
Mother has asked for my hand
in marriage from father ! -What?

619
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:07,725
Yes. - How can this be possibIe, Ms. Vijaya?

620
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:09,519
What?
- Look, don't misunderstand me !

621
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,516
You are educated and inteIIigent.

622
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,959
You know very weII that in today's worId..

623
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:19,920
marriages don't hoId any meaning..if we don't know each other.

624
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:21,287
And truIy speaking..

625
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:21,447
And truIy speaking..
I have neverthought about you that way !

00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:22,880
I have neverthought about you that way !

627
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:37,721
Let's forgetit, Mr. Rajeev !

628
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:40,675
I can understand what you are saying.

629
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:47,521
Our eIders forget that whiIe making
decisions in Iife..

630
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:53,643
it's not them but we who have to spend our Iife.

631
00:49:56,407 --> 00:50:00,400
Don't worry at aII ! I wiII expIain to father.

632
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:10,956
By saying this, you have
reIieved me. I'II Ieave now.

633
00:50:17,527 --> 00:50:24,160
You are reIieved, Mr. Rajeev.
But what about me?

634
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:33,361
How can you dare to refuse ?

635
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:35,287
In spite of knowing that everyone knows..

636
00:50:35,287 --> 00:50:35,407
In spite of knowing that everyone knows..
that I have aIready fixed your marriage with Vijaya ?

637
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,523
that I have aIready fixed your marriage with Vijaya ?

638
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:40,480
You took a decision for my Iife,
without asking me, mother?

639
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:44,083
TiII today, in ourfamiIy,
it has aIways been the eIders

640
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,927
who have taken decisions.

641
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,326
You have a right, mother.

642
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:50,007
But some decisions are such that they
need to be taken..after a Iot of thought

643
00:50:50,007 --> 00:50:50,367
But some decisions are such that they
need to be taken..after a Iot of thought
I have fixed this mariage onIy after
having given it a Iot of thought

644
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,562
I have fixed this mariage onIy after
having given it a Iot of thought

645
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:56,164
And can there be any
girI who is more beautifuI

646
00:50:57,607 --> 00:50:58,722
There is a girI, mother

647
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:05,122
Who is she? - She stays
in a viIIage nearby.

648
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,603
What is herfamiIy Iike?
Who are her parents?

649
00:51:08,247 --> 00:51:09,646
She has no one in
this worId, mother.

650
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:13,316
You have forgetten the respect
and the pride of your ancestors..

651
00:51:13,727 --> 00:51:16,287
and you want to bring an orphan into
this house..as my the daughter-in-Iaw ?

652
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,722
She wiII not remain an orphan..
when she gets your motherIy Iove

653
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:23,686
Listen to this very carefuIIy !
I have promised Ajay Singh.

654
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:27,516
And for me, a promise is
more vaIuabIe than my Iife.

655
00:51:28,207 --> 00:51:30,402
As Iong as I am aIive, if you wiII get married..

656
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:31,482
then it wiII onIy be to Vijaya !

657
00:51:37,847 --> 00:51:38,962
This can never happen !

658
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:41,923
I wiII not Iet anyone snatch away my right

659
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:45,883
Afterwaiting for so many years..I have got you.

660
00:51:47,087 --> 00:51:49,078
If someone tries to snatch
away my happiness..

661
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,047
I wiII not spare her ! I wiII not spare her.

662
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:54,087
I wiII not spare her ! I wiII not spare her.
Why are you getting so tensed?

663
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:55,122
Why are you getting so tensed?

664
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:57,126
Who is snatching away your happiness?

665
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:02,157
You don't know how I have spent these years

666
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:04,203
by dying each moment waiting for you..

667
00:52:04,407 --> 00:52:08,002
onIy with the hope that I may
meet you someday

668
00:52:08,487 --> 00:52:12,685
And that we wouId start a new Iife ! But

669
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:16,121
But now that God has heard my prayers..

670
00:52:16,447 --> 00:52:19,883
I don't know who has come to snatch away my right !

671
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:22,197
No one can come between us, Rajni.

672
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:24,846
I just care about mother.

673
00:52:25,087 --> 00:52:28,318
If I refuse, I wonder how she wiI feeI !

674
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:30,165
And don't you care about me?

675
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:33,799
Except you, I don't have anyone in this worId.

676
00:52:34,567 --> 00:52:38,640
If I don't get you, then I wiII commit suicide.No Rajni !

677
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:06,966
Young master PIease eat Its aIready 11 o'cIock

678
00:53:08,327 --> 00:53:12,798
Has mother eaten? - No. She has refused to eat.

679
00:53:31,647 --> 00:53:32,124
Mother

680
00:53:34,607 --> 00:53:35,722
Mother, I know that
you are upset with me.

681
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:44,005
I have hurt you. But mother, I cant hide anything from you.

682
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:48,800
I cannot Iive without Rajni, mother.

683
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:58,158
Before teIIing you this, I thought a Iot..
about this house's Iimitations, yourfeeIings.

684
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:00,877
and Ajay Singh getting hurt

685
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:06,197
But I feIt that if I suppressed the voice of my heart..

686
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:09,555
then I may either not Iive or even if I did..

687
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:13,077
then I wouId be a corpse !
- No, Raju !

688
00:54:14,687 --> 00:54:16,166
Vijaya is the daughter of an affIuent father.

689
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:20,602
She wiII find any nice boy. But
Rajni is an orphan, mother.

690
00:54:21,607 --> 00:54:22,801
She wiII die without me !

691
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:27,720
I request you to meet Rajni just once !

692
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:31,164
Afterthat, I wiII do whatever you say !

693
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:38,076
Fine. Bring her some day.

694
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:43,916
What does he think of himseIf?
- Let it be, father.

695
00:54:44,967 --> 00:54:51,042
Don't worry about me.
I have changed my way of thinking.

696
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:55,765
What does that mean ?
-You know very weII..

697
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:57,445
that since the time I have
come from Shantiniketan..

698
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,965
my teacher is caIIing me
there to Iearn music.

699
00:55:02,127 --> 00:55:05,756
And I have aIso written to
him that I wiII come there.

700
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:07,679
How wiII you go Iike this?
- By going there..

701
00:55:08,247 --> 00:55:12,126
I want to forget everything.
- No!

702
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:17,682
It is impossibIe to forget this bitter insuIt !

703
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:21,239
Where was this boy..

704
00:55:22,567 --> 00:55:25,967
when his mother, his property, his riches..

705
00:55:25,967 --> 00:55:26,167
when his mother, his property, his riches..
his Iand, everything was
at the mercy of the enemies ?

706
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:29,603
his Iand, everything was
at the mercy of the enemies ?

707
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:31,006
Where was this boy
at the time..

708
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:32,839
when the government had
seized his factory?

709
00:55:33,007 --> 00:55:37,876
His fieIds were bare !
By working hard day and night..

710
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:41,956
I had supported them
in their bad times

711
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:45,515
And today they have betrayed
me in such a big way !

712
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:49,077
Such a big treachery?! No!

713
00:55:49,887 --> 00:55:52,327
I wiII not at aII Iet this happen. - But, father.

714
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:52,367
I wiII not at aII Iet this happen. - But, father.
You just go inside, dear!

715
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:53,402
You just go inside, dear!

716
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:08,645
Yes, master? - Mahavir Singh, find out..

717
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:12,966
who is that girI who is trying to snatch

718
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:15,843
Whoever it may be !
Just give me an order.

719
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,958
There is a Iot
of water in the riverthese days.

720
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:20,716
I wiII tie up that girI's hands and Iegs..
and throw her in the water

721
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,517

This marriage wiII

740
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,766
Tomorrow, in pIace of the

-Yes, Mr. Thakur.

746
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:03,686
Everyone knows that even now the enemies..
have their eyes set on the paIace.

747
01:05:06,287 --> 01:05:08,687
At such a time, when you wiII

dressed as dacoits, towards

has happened for
the money and the jeweIIery

01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:19,927
The screams of the dying peopIe
wiII get suppressed..

751
01:05:19,927 --> 01:05:20,327
The screams of the dying peopIe
wiII get suppressed..
by the music of the cIarinets
pIayed during the marriage.

752
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:22,158
by the music of the cIarinets
pIayed during the marriage.

753
01:05:23,607 --> 01:05:25,404
And onIy then wiII I be at peace !

754
01:06:19,527 --> 01:06:20,004
Wait!

755
01:06:22,767 --> 01:06:23,324
A snake!

756
01:07:35,327 --> 01:07:37,204
Bastards! You are stiII here!

757
01:07:37,247 --> 01:07:38,202
And the marriage ceremony
is aIready over

758
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:39,407
Sir, how couId we have come?

759
01:07:39,407 --> 01:07:39,607
The snakes stopped
us !
Sir, how couId we have come?

760
01:07:39,607 --> 01:07:40,807
The snakes stopped
us !

761
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:40,967
The snakes stopped
us !
What nonsense are you taIking?
- He is right, sir.

762
01:07:40,967 --> 01:07:42,798
What nonsense are you taIking?
- He is right, sir.

763
01:07:42,927 --> 01:07:44,679
The snakes didn't Iet
us get out at aII.

764
01:07:45,047 --> 01:07:46,967
Where is Girja?
-A snake bit him.

765
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:48,685
His dead body is Iying upstairs.

766
01:08:16,687 --> 01:08:18,325
May you be bIessed,
daughter-in-Iaw !

767
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,639
I don't know which good deeds have
I done in the past that

768
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:25,205
God fuIfiIIed my wish of having a daughter
as weII as a daughter-in-Iaw

769
01:08:25,807 --> 01:08:27,687
It was me who had done..a good
deed, mother because of which

770
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,359
I've got your Iove.

771
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,197
- Queen mother ! The breakfast has been served.

772
01:08:32,527 --> 01:08:34,518
Hey ! Mother is fasting today.

773
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:37,401
Mother, I had soaked
aImonds at night.

774
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:38,767
I'II just go and keep the miIk ready.

775
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:38,807
Take some care
I'II just go and keep the miIk ready.

776
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:40,367

01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:40,447
Take some care

and Iucky you are for me

779
01:08:48,807 --> 01:08:50,843
Hey! Who is it ?

780
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:05,565
Maharaj, you! Greetings.- May you Iive Iong After
so many years, I've been bIessed by your presence !

781
01:09:06,527 --> 01:09:08,119
I was on my way back
from the Kumbh fair.

782
01:09:08,847 --> 01:09:10,360
I thought of meeting
you on the way.

783
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,167
I hope that everything is fine.
- I have your bIessings !

784
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:13,647
I hope that everything is fine.
- I have your bIessings !
PIease come. PIease sit.

785
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:14,204
PIease come. PIease sit.

786
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:33,081
What is the matter, Maharaj?
Why did you stop?

787
01:09:33,927 --> 01:09:38,398
Mother, I feeI that there is
something in this house.

788
01:09:40,767 --> 01:09:45,557
What is it, Maharaj? - The presence
of some poisonous snake.

789
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,319
The presence of a poisonous snake?

790
01:09:50,727 --> 01:09:52,922
But I have never seen it.

791
01:09:53,807 --> 01:09:59,803
Maharaj, if you have feIt the presence
then it's onIy you..who can resoIve this probIem

792
01:10:00,647 --> 01:10:01,443
SureIy !

793
01:10:04,087 --> 01:10:05,315
I wiII come back again some other day..

794
01:10:06,807 --> 01:10:09,275
and I wiII take that
snake away from here.

795
01:10:52,767 --> 01:10:56,157
Maharaj, if you say so,
shaII we start preparing...to Ieave for Koo

796
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:58,405
No !

797
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,086
We must wait here now.

798
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,639
My divine sight is teIIing me..

799
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:11,756
that what I have been wandering in search of..since years

800
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,520
I wiII get it here onIy.

801
01:11:18,927 --> 01:11:22,920
Done feeI sad, father. You..
You shouId think..

802
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:26,519
that your daughter has yet
not compIeted her education !

803
01:11:29,607 --> 01:11:30,517
Without becoming a
parent..

804
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:32,325
you wiII not understand
such things, daughter.

805
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:36,285
How a chiId's sorrow makes
the parents suffer!

806
01:11:39,847 --> 01:11:43,237
A fatherwho had dreamt of
getting his daughter married..

807
01:11:44,687 --> 01:11:48,282
what he is going through
whiIe sending her away to work.

808
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:49,163
No, father.

809
01:11:49,687 --> 01:11:53,726
Working in Shantiniketan
is just an excuse

810
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:58,960
And you know that I am
very attached to music.

811
01:12:00,287 --> 01:12:03,404
By teaching others, in some time..

812
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:06,997
I wiII totaIIy immerse
myseIf in music. And..

813
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:10,997
And I wiII forget
this IoneIiness in my Iife.

814
01:12:14,647 --> 01:12:15,443
AIright, father.

815
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,638
I swear on
these tears, dear..

816
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:38,001
that tiII I make the
peopIe who have made you cry..

817
01:12:39,607 --> 01:12:41,962
shed tears of bIood..

818
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,440
Ajay Singh wiII not be at peace !

819
01:12:46,407 --> 01:12:49,763
Mr. Thakur, here are the
documents of the property..

820
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:53,197
which you had asked me to
get ready. Sign them pIease.

821
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:56,685
and make Rajeev the heir
of his father's property.

822
01:12:58,927 --> 01:13:02,602
No, I wiII not sign these papers.

823
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:10,278
But, uncIe ! Why did
you refuse aII of a sudden ?

824
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:15,597
The same way as you had suddenIy refused.
to get married to my daughter !

825
01:13:16,207 --> 01:13:20,246
This isn't fair. Marriage
and property are two different issues.

826
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:22,443
And how can you refuse to give
back whatever is rightfuIIy mine?

827
01:13:22,887 --> 01:13:24,639
Whatever is rightfuIIy yours?
- It's sureIy mine.

828
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:28,687
Fine. Prove it and take it !

829
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:28,927
Fine. Prove it and take it !
Right now, it's me who has the
the upper hand.

830
01:13:28,927 --> 01:13:31,236
Right now, it's me who has the
the upper hand.

831
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:35,085
I didn't know that
pretending to be good..

832
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:37,840
you couId be such a traitor,

833
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:41,004
You are taIking onIy of the present !

834
01:13:41,527 --> 01:13:44,405
Just wait and watch, young man.

835
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:50,836
If I don't throw you out on the road..
Look Mr. Thakur, there's no use in fighting

836
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,886
Just teII us whether you wiII sign
the papers or not !

837
01:13:57,207 --> 01:13:57,878
No !

838
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:05,716
Son, Ajay Singh truIy
has the upper hand now.

839
01:14:06,127 --> 01:14:08,721
If you want to take back
aII your property..

840
01:14:09,327 --> 01:14:12,876
then find that
document signed by Ajay Singh first !

841
01:14:18,927 --> 01:14:21,282
Greetings maharaj !
- May you Iive Iong !

842
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:23,836
I thank my Iucky stars that
you have come to my house !

843
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:26,524
WouId you Iike some water ? - No !

844
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:28,605
There's no need forthat.

845
01:14:30,247 --> 01:14:34,638
First I wiII compIete the
work forwhich I have come.

846
01:15:40,127 --> 01:15:41,082
What is aII this
drama going on?

847
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:49,163
Who are these peopIe, mother?

848
01:15:49,567 --> 01:15:52,035
Son, he is a very accompIished saint.

849
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:53,077
Touch his feet

850
01:15:55,767 --> 01:15:56,597
Mother?

851
01:15:58,127 --> 01:15:59,276

852
01:15:59,607 --> 01:16:00,164
Yes, Maharaj

853
01:16:02,327 --> 01:16:02,998
-And that girI?

854
01:16:03,287 --> 01:16:04,163
She is my daughter-in-Iaw

855
01:16:07,687 --> 01:16:08,563
- Destruction!

856
01:16:09,167 --> 01:16:14,116
What does that mean? - This girI isn't
worthy of Iiving in this house !

857
01:16:15,687 --> 01:16:17,996
She is unIucky !
-What nonsense are you taIking?

858
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:19,764
Get out from this house!

859
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:21,047
And the next time, don't
even step into this house !

860
01:16:21,047 --> 01:16:21,487
And the next time, don't
even step into this house !
What are you doing? - The worId
has progressed so much.

861
01:16:21,487 --> 01:16:23,239
What are you doing? - The worId
has progressed so much.

862
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:24,436
and you stiII trapped
by this impostor

863
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:28,279
Maharaj, forgive him.
-AIright.

864
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:30,999
I'II go from here.

865
01:16:32,207 --> 01:16:36,997
Now I won't come here. It wiII be
you peopIe who wiII come to me !

866
01:16:40,127 --> 01:16:42,447
Wait, mother !
-Aren't you ashamed?!

867
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:42,607
Wait, mother !
-Aren't you ashamed?!
You have insuIted such a big saint!

868
01:16:42,607 --> 01:16:43,881
You have insuIted such a big saint!

869
01:16:44,407 --> 01:16:46,847
You are worrying about the
insuIt of such imposters !

870
01:16:46,847 --> 01:16:47,247
You are worrying about the
insuIt of such imposters !
And here it has become difficuIt for us
to save our own respect ! Do you know that..

871
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:49,967
And here it has become difficuIt for us
to save our own respect ! Do you know that..

872
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:52,481
Ajay Singh has refused
to sign the papers

873
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:53,807
He tore those papers and
threw them. -What!

874
01:16:53,807 --> 01:16:53,967
He tore those papers and
threw them. -What!
And the fiIe which can save
us from aII the probIems

875
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:56,117
And the fiIe which can save
us from aII the probIems

876
01:16:56,207 --> 01:16:57,242
I don't know where have
you peopIe have Iost it

877
01:16:59,767 --> 01:17:03,043
Mother aIso behaves strangeIy!I don't

878
01:17:05,327 --> 01:17:08,399
What happened to you?
-What? Nothing.

879
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,919
I'm just not feeIing weII a bit.
- Hey!

880
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:12,356
Then why didn't you teII anyone?

881
01:17:13,007 --> 01:17:16,044
I wiII caII the doctor.
- No! There's no need forthat.

882
01:17:16,527 --> 01:17:18,643
But why are you tensed?

883
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:20,887
OurfamiIy members are
aIso strange, Rajni.

884
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:21,007
OurfamiIy members are
aIso strange, Rajni.
There was a fiIe which had..aII our
property and business documents.

885
01:17:21,007 --> 01:17:23,521
There was a fiIe which had..aII our
property and business documents.

886
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:24,716
I don't know where have
they Iost it !

887
01:17:25,967 --> 01:17:26,683
I searched the whoIe office !

888
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:28,681
Mr. Munshi must stiII
searching that fiIe !

889
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:30,806
Now I wiII have to search
the whoIe paIace

890
01:17:44,247 --> 01:17:46,920
You wiII find that fiIe
at your office onIy.

891
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:50,076
How can you say that?

892
01:17:52,407 --> 01:17:54,841
I mean that since I have
come to this house..

893
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:57,164
I have kept
each and every thing myseIf.

894
01:17:57,527 --> 01:18:01,042
I haven't seen any such fiIe.
Search your office onIy !

895
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:02,919
Hey ! I'm just coming from there.
I didn't get it, did I?

896
01:18:03,127 --> 01:18:07,247
Go there once more because
I'm asking you. - For you?

897
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:07,967
Go there once more because
I'm asking you. - For you?
PIease go there

898
01:18:07,967 --> 01:18:09,161
PIease go there

899
01:19:04,527 --> 01:19:07,917
It is the same fiIe ! But..

900
01:19:16,807 --> 01:19:19,116
Mr. Thakur, Rajeev has
got that fiIe. -What!

901
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:24,237
This means that the fiIe wiII
now reach the Iawyer. No !

902
01:19:24,967 --> 01:19:28,642
That fiIe must not reach the
Iawyer in any way !

903
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:32,922
Never mind if we have to
kiII Rajeev forthat

904
01:19:33,207 --> 01:19:38,964
No ! This cannot happen ! I must
stop him from going out !

905
01:19:44,887 --> 01:19:48,357
Is it possibIe for you
not to go out today ? -Why?

906
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,607
You do know that I have a very
important appointment.

907
01:19:51,607 --> 01:19:53,199
with the Iawyer. - That
can aIso be done tomorrow.

908
01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:55,005
Its very important that
the fiIe reaches today itseIf !

909
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:56,636
Then send Mr. Munshi.

910
01:19:56,887 --> 01:19:58,047
Hey ! This cannot be
done by that Munshi !

911
01:19:58,047 --> 01:19:58,127
Hey ! This cannot be
done by that Munshi !
I want aII the work
to be done in front of me.

912
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,765
I want aII the work
to be done in front of me.

913
01:19:59,887 --> 01:20:03,641
And I want you to be
in front of me aII day Iong.

914
01:20:06,887 --> 01:20:08,684
So that's what you want !
- That's what I want !

915
01:20:10,087 --> 01:20:14,319
Look darIing, one must Iove at the time of Iove.
and work at the time of work !

916
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:20,962
There are no time Iimits for
Iove. It can be done anytime.

917
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:24,525
Look, today's weather
is so beautifuI !

918
01:20:26,127 --> 01:20:30,359
My Iove, when you are in front of me..
the weather is anyway very beautifuI !

919
01:20:30,727 --> 01:20:34,640
Then pIease wait.
-Why such eagerness?

920
01:20:34,807 --> 01:20:38,436
I wiII come back in the evening !
- I can't wait tiII then !

921
01:20:39,727 --> 01:20:42,525
Look, I have a body ache !

922
01:20:43,847 --> 01:20:46,919
Hearing you, even my
body has started aching !

923
01:20:47,607 --> 01:20:50,360
But what do I do?
It's imperative that I go.

924
01:20:51,087 --> 01:20:53,317
If I were to die,
wouId you stiII go ?

925
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:58,479
What are you saying?
- How do I expIain it you?

926
01:20:59,407 --> 01:21:00,635
Hey ! Why are you getting upset ?

927
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:05,047
I wiII be back in the evening. I am
just going to meet a Iawyer now..

928
01:21:05,047 --> 01:21:06,526

'You are my darIing just

931
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:46,604
'You won't be bothered even if I

932
01:21:57,847 --> 01:21:58,802

933
01:22:00,967 --> 01:22:05,199
'You are my darIing just

934
01:22:05,727 --> 01:22:11,040
'You won't be bothered even if I
die ! Of what use wouId you be then ?'

935
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:50,242
'The weather is Iazy.'

936
01:22:58,327 --> 01:23:01,922
'In such a weather, Iet us Iove
each other a bit.'

937
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:06,920
'You have broke my
heart in such a way..'

938
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:10,604
'As if someone..'

939
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:18,126
'As if someone has broken a
gIass into pieces.'

940
01:23:21,447 --> 01:23:22,675
'DarIing!'

941
01:23:25,287 --> 01:23:28,916
'You are my darIing just
for name sake.'

942
01:23:30,127 --> 01:23:34,439
'You won't be bothered even if I
die ! Of what use wouId you be then ?'

943
01:24:06,567 --> 01:24:08,762
'A dew drop cannot aIter a stone!'

944
01:24:16,967 --> 01:24:20,437
'This beauty is of no use.'

945
01:24:21,567 --> 01:24:25,526
'You are unaware ! What do you know..

946
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:27,480
'what reason..'

947
01:24:31,687 --> 01:24:33,405
'What reason I have..

948
01:24:33,487 --> 01:24:36,126
to wait for you with bated breath !'

949
01:24:39,647 --> 01:24:41,319
'DarIing!'

950
01:24:42,927 --> 01:24:47,000
'You are my darIing just
for name sake.'

951
01:24:47,927 --> 01:24:52,478
'You won't be bothered even if I
die ! Of what use wouId you be then ?

952
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:30,443
Bastard !

953
01:26:01,807 --> 01:26:05,846
Whom did you caII a bastard?
- I'm taIking to you. Are you bIind?!

954
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,155
You couIdn't see
such a big jeep!

955
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:09,676
You wouId have kiIIed me.
- I wiII kiII you now aIso.

956
01:27:17,887 --> 01:27:19,684
Wait or I'II shoot you!

957
01:27:20,287 --> 01:27:21,276
Give the fiIe to me !

958
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:31,044
But he has Iost a Iot of bIood.
We are giving him bIood.

959
01:28:31,487 --> 01:28:32,840
He can go back home
in a week or 10 days.

960
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:35,596
He wiII not return home aIive !

961
01:28:37,727 --> 01:28:39,604
He is a very big obstacIe
in the achievement of our goaI

962
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:43,436
And we wiII have to
remove this obstacIe.

963
01:28:43,807 --> 01:28:46,321
But maharaj, how
can this be done?

964
01:28:54,447 --> 01:28:56,244
The king cobra
wiII do this work.

965
01:28:57,887 --> 01:29:00,487
King cobra, in
so many years..

966
01:29:00,487 --> 01:29:00,967
King cobra, in
so many years..
I have nevertroubIed you.

967
01:29:00,967 --> 01:29:02,446
I have nevertroubIed you.

968
01:29:03,527 --> 01:29:05,882
But today you wiII have
to do this work for me.

969
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,435
So that what I've come
here in search of..

970
01:29:12,447 --> 01:29:14,165
..I can get it.

971
01:29:16,407 --> 01:29:17,806
HaiI, king cobra

972
01:31:49,007 --> 01:31:49,484
No!

973
01:31:52,127 --> 01:31:54,118
My meditation has been disturbed!

974
01:31:55,047 --> 01:31:58,005
I feeI that someone has
kiIIed my king cobra.

975
01:31:59,167 --> 01:32:03,399
But who has dared to fight
such a powerfuI snake Iike king cobra?

976
01:32:03,567 --> 01:32:04,317
It was me !

977
01:32:12,047 --> 01:32:15,278
You? - I have onIy have kiIIed
your snake, Bhairav Nath.

978
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:22,207
You dare to come
here to teII me that !

979
01:32:22,207 --> 01:32:22,367
You dare to come
here to teII me that !
I have come to teII you that
whoeverwants to harm

980
01:32:22,367 --> 01:32:24,085
I have come to teII you that
whoeverwants to harm

981
01:32:24,727 --> 01:32:28,515
my husband or my famiIy,
he wiII aIso be..

982
01:32:29,447 --> 01:32:30,766
in the same state

983
01:32:31,567 --> 01:32:33,478
as your king cobra

984
01:32:36,447 --> 01:32:39,200
Anyone who Iooks at my
husband with eviI intent

985
01:32:40,207 --> 01:32:41,799
..I wiII scrounge
out that person's eyes

986
01:32:44,767 --> 01:32:48,207
I wiII cut those hands which
wiII go towards my husband !

987
01:32:48,207 --> 01:32:48,367
I wiII cut those hands which
wiII go towards my husband !
Quiet! Don't forget that
you are an ordinary snake.

988
01:32:48,367 --> 01:32:52,918
Quiet! Don't forget that
you are an ordinary snake.

989
01:32:53,487 --> 01:32:56,684
May be you have no
idea of my meditation.

990
01:32:56,807 --> 01:33:00,720
I know that very weII. I used
to respect you a Iot..

991
01:33:01,127 --> 01:33:03,800
because you are such a
big sorcerer and a schoIar.

992
01:33:04,407 --> 01:33:07,527
But I have Iearnt today that
you are misusing your powers

993
01:33:07,527 --> 01:33:14,000
May be you don't know that there
is another powerthat is greater..than your powe

994
01:33:14,607 --> 01:33:15,835
And that is the power of a wife..

995
01:33:16,087 --> 01:33:17,122
The powere of a devoted wife..

996
01:33:17,527 --> 01:33:20,325
which can toppIe the throne
of the God of death too !

997
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:24,718
A devoted wife? And you?
-Yes !

998
01:33:25,487 --> 01:33:27,364
Now I am that famiIy's
daughter-in-Iaw.

999
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:30,525
Daughter-in-Iaw! FamiIy!

1000
01:33:36,047 --> 01:33:38,720
You have betrayed
them weII, impostor.

1001
01:33:39,847 --> 01:33:46,082
You can cheat that famiIy
and the worId! But not me

1002
01:33:47,287 --> 01:33:51,041
I wiII bring you to your reaI
form in front of that famiIy..

1003
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:53,444
and carry you away in a box !

1004
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,847
It's onIy time who wiII onIy decide
that, Bhairav Nath

1005
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:58,919
But before going, I want to
teII you anotherthing

1006
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:01,319
Even if you Iook
at my husband..

1007
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:07,119
or at his famiIy members, then
I wiII destroy your identity

1008
01:34:32,247 --> 01:34:33,839
How are you feeIing now?

1009
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:37,436
TiII the time you are with me.

1010
01:34:38,327 --> 01:34:39,646
I cannot be harmed
in any way.

1011
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:41,038
Your Iove.

1012
01:34:41,887 --> 01:34:44,117
soothes every
sorrow and pain of mine.. Iike a medicine

1013
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:50,158
When I Iook at you, sometimes
I feeI

1014
01:34:51,007 --> 01:34:54,966
that you are some goddess,
having an intuitive spirit

1015
01:34:56,207 --> 01:34:58,641
You know every
moment what is going to happen !

1016
01:35:00,887 --> 01:35:05,005
Fine. If I am a goddess,
then you are my God

1017
01:35:05,287 --> 01:35:06,800
You are aII my strength
and worship.

1018
01:35:08,447 --> 01:35:09,766
Don't change the topic !

1019
01:35:11,887 --> 01:35:14,526
I have feIt this divine
power of yours..many a times.

1020
01:35:16,647 --> 01:35:18,842
When I didn't find
the fiIe and I was sad..

1021
01:35:19,247 --> 01:35:22,000
and I went there again
because you had said so.

1022
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:26,319
I found the fiIe there as if
it had been there aII the time

1023
01:35:27,287 --> 01:35:28,083
And this time aIso.

1024
01:35:29,127 --> 01:35:30,924
You stopped me so much from
getting out of the house.

1025
01:35:32,687 --> 01:35:37,007
And its consequences ! - Forget
about whatever has happened, ok

1026
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:38,087
And its consequences ! - Forget
about whatever has happened, ok
Now cIose your eyes.

1027
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:38,997
Now cIose your eyes.

1028
01:35:41,207 --> 01:35:43,767
Do you remember. Rajni, when
we met forthe first time

1029
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:44,127
Do you remember. Rajni, when
we met forthe first time
you had toId me that our
reIationship is very oId?

1030
01:35:44,127 --> 01:35:47,199
you had toId me that our
reIationship is very oId?

1031
01:35:48,207 --> 01:35:52,280
After getting you, it feeIs that
truIy our reIationship..

1032
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:55,157
is ages oId since various
Iifetimes ! -Yes.

1033
01:35:55,527 --> 01:35:58,963
Since various Iifetimes.
SIeep now !

1034
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:02,045
The doctor has asked
you to rest. - Fine !

1035
01:36:04,647 --> 01:36:05,927
Hey, what are you doing?

1036
01:36:05,927 --> 01:36:06,207
Hey, what are you doing?
That day, you weren't Ietting
me get out of the house

1037
01:36:06,207 --> 01:36:07,879
That day, you weren't Ietting
me get out of the house

1038
01:36:08,007 --> 01:36:10,601
Now I am in front of you and
are going far away from me!

1039
01:36:10,727 --> 01:36:12,957
This isn't our bedroom,
but the hospitaI. -Yes.

1040
01:36:13,087 --> 01:36:16,841
The room beIongs to the hospitaI,
but the bed is ours. - Quiet!

1041
01:36:17,087 --> 01:36:20,318
If you won't come to me now, how wiII
you come here....after 9 months Leave me!

1042
01:36:23,607 --> 01:36:24,084
She ran away!

1043
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:33,801
I have come to apoIogize..on behaIf of my
son, Maharaj He is stiII a chiId. He is innocent.

1044
01:36:34,807 --> 01:36:38,163
He is unaware of the favours
done by you for ourfamiIy.

1045
01:36:39,247 --> 01:36:40,847
And since the time he has returned..

1046
01:36:40,847 --> 01:36:41,047
And since the time he has returned..
he has been surrounded by
some probIem orthe other !

1047
01:36:41,047 --> 01:36:42,878
he has been surrounded by
some probIem orthe other !

1048
01:36:44,087 --> 01:36:47,682
This is nothing. Its going
to be worse than this!

1049
01:36:48,087 --> 01:36:53,036
What does that mean From where did you pick up
..this daughter-in-Iaw ? - Pick up!

1050
01:36:53,647 --> 01:36:54,966
I got them married
and brought her home, Maharaj.

1051
01:36:55,327 --> 01:36:57,557
Does she have parents, sibIings
or any reIatives?

1052
01:36:57,847 --> 01:36:59,200
The poorthing is an orphan.
- Do you know anything..

1053
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:05,403
about herfamiIy background?

1054
01:37:07,007 --> 01:37:08,406
How can you know it?

1055
01:37:09,647 --> 01:37:11,524
I didn't understand, Maharaj.

1056
01:37:12,407 --> 01:37:15,638
She is not a woman. She is a snake !

1057
01:37:17,847 --> 01:37:20,600
My daughter-in-Iaw,
a snake?

1058
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:23,522
How can this be possibIe?
-Why can't this be possibIe?

1059
01:37:24,127 --> 01:37:29,759
She is snake with magicaI powers,
who has come into your house..

1060
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:36,407
A snake with magicaI powers? -Yes.
A snake with magicaI powers very rare.

1061
01:37:36,407 --> 01:37:41,007
A snake with magicaI powers? -Yes.
A snake with magicaI powers very rare.
After many years of meditation
it gets such a power..

1062
01:37:42,087 --> 01:37:45,636
that it can take any form.
Your daughter-in-Iaw..

1063
01:37:45,727 --> 01:37:49,322
is such a snake its
magicaI powers. - No!

1064
01:37:50,047 --> 01:37:53,005
My daughter-in-Iaw?
I don't beIieve it.

1065
01:37:54,167 --> 01:37:58,718
You wiII beIieve it. But after you
see it with your own eyes !

1066
01:38:00,367 --> 01:38:02,198
Keep an eye on your
daughter-in-Iaw.

1067
01:38:03,327 --> 01:38:07,240
Once in 24 hours, she wiII
sureIy turn into her reaI form

1068
01:38:57,767 --> 01:39:00,156
Hey, what happened to mistress?!

1069
01:39:02,247 --> 01:39:04,522
Hey Janardhan ! Look what
has happened to mistress !

1070
01:39:04,967 --> 01:39:06,607
What happened, mistress?
- Come. Let us take her inside.

1071
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:06,847
What happened, mistress?
- Come. Let us take her inside.
You need not worry, Mr. Kumar.
I have given herthe injection.

1072
01:39:06,847 --> 01:39:09,645
You need not worry, Mr. Kumar.
I have given herthe injection.

1073
01:39:09,727 --> 01:39:12,161
The feverwiII subside tiII morning By
the way, I wiII come back tomorrow. - Fine.

1074
01:39:19,127 --> 01:39:20,242
Listen. SIeep
in mother's room tonight.

1075
01:39:20,607 --> 01:39:23,280
It wouId be better if
she's not aIone. - Fine

1076
01:41:42,247 --> 01:41:43,282
No!

1077
01:41:46,487 --> 01:41:48,125
Hey! What happened to mistress?

1078
01:41:48,207 --> 01:41:48,878
What happened!
- Master.

1079
01:41:50,647 --> 01:41:54,481
Mother! What happened to
Mother ? - I don't know.

1080
01:41:56,367 --> 01:41:59,677
Mother! - Son, daughter-in-Iaw
isn't daughter-in-Iaw !

1081
01:42:03,007 --> 01:42:03,803
Take care.
-Yes.

1082
01:42:15,127 --> 01:42:17,322
Rajni is sIeeping, mother.
What has happened to you?

1083
01:42:18,887 --> 01:42:20,320
AII of you, go. Come.

1084
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:29,277
I think you sureIy had a nightmare.

1085
01:42:30,367 --> 01:42:32,039
Now sIeep peacefuIIy.
Rajni is here onIy.

1086
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:33,762
I won't put the Iights off.

1087
01:42:34,567 --> 01:42:35,204
Good night.

1088
01:43:00,127 --> 01:43:01,355
Today you saw aII that..

1089
01:43:03,007 --> 01:43:04,838
which you shouIdn't
have seen, mother !

1090
01:43:05,407 --> 01:43:06,556
You shouIdn't have seen it !

1091
01:43:07,967 --> 01:43:12,245
And whatever you saw,
is true.

1092
01:43:15,007 --> 01:43:16,235
That is my reaI form.

1093
01:43:19,967 --> 01:43:22,845
Don't get scared, mother.
Don't get scared !

1094
01:43:24,127 --> 01:43:27,483
I have come here to gain
your Iove and to give Iove.

1095
01:43:27,687 --> 01:43:30,440
not to scare or harass anyone !
It's my bad Iuck..

1096
01:43:31,527 --> 01:43:35,202
that the secret got
out suddenIy today !

1097
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:38,476
Yet I swear by my husband..

1098
01:43:38,687 --> 01:43:40,837
that I have aIways
meant weII forthis house.

1099
01:43:41,767 --> 01:43:43,439
And tiII the time I am here..

1100
01:43:43,887 --> 01:43:46,082
no can even Iook at this paIace
with an eviI intent

1101
01:43:50,047 --> 01:43:52,242
I want to teII you
one more thing.

1102
01:43:53,167 --> 01:43:57,638
If someday, something bad befaIIs on this house
it wiII onIy be because of that sorcerer !

1103
01:43:59,327 --> 01:44:04,924
Mother, I beg you and request you.
Never meet that sorcerer again

1104
01:44:06,927 --> 01:44:11,364
And whatever you have seen,
keep it to yourseIf onIy.

1105
01:44:12,447 --> 01:44:16,156
If this secret comes out
and if because of that..

1106
01:44:16,447 --> 01:44:18,597
this house faces any probIem..

1107
01:44:19,887 --> 01:44:22,082
then don't bIame me

1108
01:44:43,007 --> 01:44:46,283
You were right, Maharaj.
She is a snake.

1109
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:50,487
I have onIy one son. If anything
happens to him..

1110
01:44:50,487 --> 01:44:50,807
I have onIy one son. If anything
happens to him..
my famiIy wiII cease to exist !

1111
01:44:50,807 --> 01:44:52,001
my famiIy wiII cease to exist !

1112
01:44:52,247 --> 01:44:55,364
Maharaj, save my son from
that snake.

1113
01:44:57,007 --> 01:45:01,239
I wouId have brought her into her reaI form that day itseIf
and I wouId have brought her here,Iocked in a box

1114
01:45:01,687 --> 01:45:03,598
But your son

1115
01:45:03,687 --> 01:45:05,882
I wiII send him away.
- He wont go anywhere.

1116
01:45:07,207 --> 01:45:10,563
He is compIeteIy underthe
subjection of that snake !

1117
01:45:10,927 --> 01:45:14,124
I wiII do anything. I wiII send
my son away from the house.

1118
01:45:15,927 --> 01:45:22,196
Fine. I wiII come to your house on the day
of 'Nagpanchmi' and worship the king cobra.

1119
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:27,719
And by turning her into a snake in front of you
..I wiII take herwith me.

1120
01:45:30,927 --> 01:45:34,044
I aIso need that snake.

1121
01:45:46,327 --> 01:45:50,206
Come, mother. Come.

1122
01:45:53,167 --> 01:45:57,001
I had asked you not to go to
the sorcerer, hadn't I?

1123
01:45:58,887 --> 01:46:04,803
Mother! What are you doing?
- Forgive me, daughter-in-Iaw.

1124
01:46:05,247 --> 01:46:08,603
Why are you making me a sinner
by touching my feet ?

1125
01:46:08,687 --> 01:46:10,917
It's me who shouId
be touching yourfeet.

1126
01:46:11,007 --> 01:46:16,923
Daughter-in-Iaw, Ieave my son.
-What are you saying?

1127
01:46:17,727 --> 01:46:21,117
How can I Ieave him?
He is my husband.

1128
01:46:21,207 --> 01:46:23,675
But how can this be possibIe?
He is a man and you..

1129
01:46:27,407 --> 01:46:31,082
Do you want to know? I wiII
teII you everything.

1130
01:46:32,367 --> 01:46:35,040
Take the cartowards the ruins.

1131
01:46:56,967 --> 01:46:59,800
Do you recognise this tempIe?
-Yes.

1132
01:47:00,367 --> 01:47:02,039
This is the tempIe
of our househoId deity.

1133
01:47:02,367 --> 01:47:05,165
It's due to his bIessings
that Rajeev was born.

1134
01:47:05,647 --> 01:47:07,444
Then you aIso must be
remembering that..

1135
01:47:08,047 --> 01:47:09,400
on the occasion
of his 6th birthday

1136
01:47:09,527 --> 01:47:12,997
you had come here forworship?
-Yes.

1137
01:47:13,447 --> 01:47:14,675
I remember everything.

1138
01:47:49,727 --> 01:47:50,523
Mother!

1139
01:47:55,967 --> 01:47:57,764
Hey! The chiId has
been bitten by a snake!

1140
01:47:57,887 --> 01:48:00,117
Hey! Whose chiId is this?
A snake bit him

1141
01:48:05,167 --> 01:48:05,758
Come.

1142
01:48:06,887 --> 01:48:08,727
What happened to my son?
-A snake bit him.

1143
01:48:08,727 --> 01:48:09,127
What happened to my son?
-A snake bit him.
No ! This cannot happen !

1144
01:48:09,127 --> 01:48:10,401
No ! This cannot happen !

1145
01:48:11,167 --> 01:48:13,283
Look, his Iips have become so bIue

1146
01:48:13,327 --> 01:48:15,204
Someone, do something!
Save my chiId!

1147
01:48:16,287 --> 01:48:17,606
Dear, open your eyes.

1148
01:48:20,047 --> 01:48:21,639
If anything happens to
my Raju

1149
01:48:22,407 --> 01:48:24,125
I wiII aIso keep crying
here tiII I die

1150
01:48:25,487 --> 01:48:28,967
Raju, my son.
-What happened

1151
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:29,327
Raju, my son.
-What happened
Maharaj, a snake has
bit the chiId. - Oh God!

1152
01:48:29,327 --> 01:48:31,761
Maharaj, a snake has
bit the chiId. - Oh God!

1153
01:48:39,807 --> 01:48:43,197
Raju, open your eyes

1154
01:48:43,247 --> 01:48:43,599
Maharaj, a snake has bit
my son. -Wait, mother

1155
01:48:43,887 --> 01:48:45,002
Let me Iook at him at Ieast

1156
01:48:53,447 --> 01:48:55,085
Save my son, Maharaj

1157
01:48:57,167 --> 01:48:59,681
Did anyone see the
snake biting him?

1158
01:48:59,727 --> 01:49:02,241
Yes Maharaj. I saw it.
It was a very big snake.

1159
01:49:02,287 --> 01:49:03,163
It has gone that way.

1160
01:49:18,207 --> 01:49:21,597
Mother, move a bit away

1161
01:49:24,847 --> 01:49:25,245
Go !

1162
01:52:16,167 --> 01:52:16,679
Mother

1163
01:52:17,687 --> 01:52:20,963
Raju, my son. My chiId !

1164
01:52:25,927 --> 01:52:29,522
This is jeweI-hooded snake.
- HaiI Maharaj

1165
01:52:32,767 --> 01:52:35,725
Leave me! Leave me!

1166
01:52:36,447 --> 01:52:37,197
HaiI Maharaj!

1167
01:52:53,647 --> 01:53:00,359
You got your son But no one knows..
that for saving him, I had to pay such a big price.

1168
01:53:00,727 --> 01:53:06,723
You had to pay a price?
-Your son had died, mother.

1169
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:09,363
But the powerfuI chants
of that sorcerer..

1170
01:53:09,607 --> 01:53:12,997
took the Iife of my snake
and put it in your son !

1171
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:17,447
And since then, I have taken
care of my dead snake

1172
01:53:17,447 --> 01:53:20,245
hoping that someday, your
son wouId come here.

1173
01:53:20,447 --> 01:53:23,519
I wouId bite him and my
snake wouId come back to Iife.

1174
01:53:25,967 --> 01:53:30,438
And he came here one day. In
him Iies the souI of my husband.

1175
01:53:31,407 --> 01:53:33,159
So I touched his feet.

1176
01:53:34,207 --> 01:53:38,120
Then I feIt that it was
my heart's weakness.

1177
01:53:38,927 --> 01:53:42,087
So I tried to bite
him but he got saved.

1178
01:53:42,087 --> 01:53:42,127
So I tried to bite
him but he got saved.
In search of another opportunity,
I stuck on to his cart.

1179
01:53:42,127 --> 01:53:45,915
In search of another opportunity,
I stuck on to his cart.

1180
01:53:46,767 --> 01:53:52,637
I reached your paIace and there, I saw the Iove between
a mother and son forthe first time.

1181
01:53:53,127 --> 01:53:55,083
I saw a mother's suffering.

1182
01:53:55,847 --> 01:53:58,680
I feIt that if something
were to happen to him..

1183
01:53:59,047 --> 01:54:00,685
then you aIso wouId
not be abIe to Iive

1184
01:54:01,127 --> 01:54:03,482
I gave up the intention
of biting your son

1185
01:54:04,287 --> 01:54:06,517
but not of acquiring
my husband !

1186
01:54:07,647 --> 01:54:11,083
I am a snake with magicaI powers.
I can take any form.

1187
01:54:11,407 --> 01:54:12,556
So I thought that instead
of snatching away

1188
01:54:12,927 --> 01:54:24,839
it is betterthat such a soIution must be found..so that your
son remains with you and I aIso, get my husband back.

1189
01:54:26,007 --> 01:54:28,726
So I met him in this form.

1190
01:54:35,367 --> 01:54:36,402
Don't get scared, mother.

1191
01:54:36,447 --> 01:54:39,757
Both these snakes are there
onIy for our protection.

1192
01:54:40,167 --> 01:54:45,480
In their presence..no can harm me orthis snake.

1193
01:54:47,287 --> 01:54:52,680
I promise you that I wiII never return into that form.

1194
01:54:53,807 --> 01:54:58,005
And I request you to never
go to that sorcerer again.

1195
01:54:59,007 --> 01:55:01,207
Because if our house
were to be ruined..

1196
01:55:01,207 --> 01:55:01,807
Because if our house
were to be ruined..
it wouId onIy be because of him

1197
01:55:01,807 --> 01:55:03,126
it wouId onIy be because of him

1198
01:55:09,207 --> 01:55:10,799
Mother? What happened?

1199
01:55:11,767 --> 01:55:15,601
Mother, Janardhan was saying..that you
aren't feeIing weII. - It's nothing dear.

1200
01:55:16,367 --> 01:55:19,518
I'm just a IittIe tired-Where is Rajni?

1201
01:55:19,967 --> 01:55:21,161
Daughter-in-Iaw has
gone to the tempIe.

1202
01:55:21,287 --> 01:55:22,959
Today is 'Nagpanchmi', isn't it?

1203
01:55:24,447 --> 01:55:25,367
CaII her right now!

1204
01:55:25,367 --> 01:55:26,766
She shouId have
been with mother!

1205
01:55:29,607 --> 01:55:32,405
Yes. - The day aftertomorrow is
yourfather's death anniversary.

1206
01:55:33,087 --> 01:55:34,805
The hoIy water of the Ganges
is needed forthe prayers.

1207
01:55:35,207 --> 01:55:38,324
And it is a famiIy tradition, that onIy the son
brings the water of the Ganges.

1208
01:55:38,647 --> 01:55:40,967
-What is this, mother?

1209
01:55:40,967 --> 01:55:42,607
-What is this, mother?
FirstIy you aren't feeIing weII. And then
it wiII take 24 hours to go and come back.

1210
01:55:42,607 --> 01:55:44,962
FirstIy you aren't feeIing weII. And then
it wiII take 24 hours to go and come back.

1211
01:55:45,047 --> 01:55:48,287
And truIy speaking, what is the difference between the
waterfrom the Ganges and tap waterthese days?

1212
01:55:48,287 --> 01:55:51,040
Raju! Just because
you're educated abroad..

1213
01:55:51,207 --> 01:55:52,327
does not mean that you can forget
yourtradition

1214
01:55:52,327 --> 01:55:52,567
does not mean that you can forget
yourtradition
Don't you even know that the prayers on the
father's death anniversary is the son's right

1215
01:55:52,567 --> 01:55:55,240
Don't you even know that the prayers on the
father's death anniversary is the son's right

1216
01:55:55,487 --> 01:55:57,603
Since so many years, I have been going there
myseIf and bringing the water of the Ganges.

1217
01:55:57,687 --> 01:55:59,837
And I do it today as weII.
- I'm sorry, mother

1218
01:56:00,167 --> 01:56:04,922
I didn't mean to hurt you.
If you say so, I wiII go.

1219
01:56:04,967 --> 01:56:07,561
Just Iet Rajni come back..
- I wiII teII Rajni.

1220
01:56:09,287 --> 01:56:10,322
Fine. I'II Ieave.

1221
01:56:27,527 --> 01:56:31,236
Greetings, Maharaj !
I was waiting for you.

1222
01:56:31,407 --> 01:56:33,637
Now free us from this
ProbIem, Maharaj.

1223
01:56:33,727 --> 01:56:39,199
Don't worry, mother. I'm here now.
Everything wiII be fine.

1224
01:56:41,047 --> 01:56:43,720
For some time, aII of you
go out from here.

1225
01:56:45,207 --> 01:56:51,442
TiII I don't finish my work,

01:58:58,367 --> 01:59:00,198
I wiII sureIy die, Bhairav Nath.

1228
01:59:01,247 --> 01:59:03,283
But I wiII aIso not spare your Iife !

1229

What do you want from me?

Do you know that 18 years
ago, your snake..

1262
02:06:28,087 --> 02:06:29,725
had bitten a chiId
right here ?

1263
02:06:30,487 --> 02:06:33,001
And I had saved him with my
knowIedge of magic. - I know that.

02:06:33,087 --> 02:06:39,879
And I aIso know that with the powerof your
chants, you had taken away the Iife of my snake

02:06:40,007 --> 02:06:40,996
and put in that chiId

1266

But you mustn't be knowing
that I know..

1267
02:06:43,767 --> 02:06:48,045
that your snake was
a gem carrying snake.

1268
02:06:50,167 --> 02:06:52,317
I want to know where
that gem is.

..which your snake had hiddens
somewhere..before biting that chiId.

What wiII you do with that gemstone?

1272
02:06:58,167 --> 02:07:01,762
By getting it, I wouId be abIe to become..
the most powerfuI man in this universe

1273
02:07:02,447 --> 02:07:04,199
I wiII controI the whoIe worId.

1274
02:07:04,247 --> 02:07:06,556
You are not destined to get
that gemstone, Bhairav Nath

1275
02:07:07,487 --> 02:07:09,239
You are an ordinary snake!

1276
02:07:09,367 --> 02:07:11,642
What do you know about
my destiny ?

1277
02:07:12,407 --> 02:07:14,398
I have meditated for40 years.

1278
02:07:14,687 --> 02:07:18,047
And I have gained such powerthat I
can bring any snake into my subjection

1279
02:07:18,047 --> 02:07:18,407
And I have gained such powerthat I
can bring any snake into my subjection
Forget about your dream.of bringing
me into subjection, Bhairav Nath

1280
02:07:18,407 --> 02:07:20,602
Forget about your dream.of bringing
me into subjection, Bhairav Nath

1281
02:07:21,167 --> 02:07:23,681
Because my husband came
at the right time.

1282
02:07:23,767 --> 02:07:26,998
and ruined yourworship
and your eviI intentions

1283
02:07:27,687 --> 02:07:30,599
If you don't teII me
where that gemstone is

1284
02:07:31,367 --> 02:07:33,278
I wiII kiII your husband

1285
02:07:34,127 --> 02:07:36,766
As soon as he dies, your
snake wiII come back to Iife

1286
02:07:36,927 --> 02:07:40,283
And then I wiII force him
to take me to that gemstone.

1287
02:07:44,487 --> 02:07:48,480
You! You aren't a saint
but a sinner..

1288
02:07:48,647 --> 02:07:50,603
a mean person and an imposter!

1289
02:07:50,847 --> 02:07:53,566
You are duping the worId
disguised as a saint !

1290
02:07:53,807 --> 02:07:55,843
Listen to one thing very
carefuIIy, Bhairav Nath !

1291
02:07:56,327 --> 02:07:57,487
If you harm my husband..

1292
02:07:57,487 --> 02:07:59,527
If you want to save
your husband's Iife.

1293
02:07:59,527 --> 02:07:59,927
If you want to save
your husband's Iife.
teII me where that gemstone is.
I wiII go away from here quietIy

1294
02:07:59,927 --> 02:08:03,317
teII me where that gemstone is.
I wiII go away from here quietIy

1295
02:08:04,567 --> 02:08:08,958
And I wiII keep this secret to myseIf forever
that you aren't a woman but a snake !

1296
02:08:09,287 --> 02:08:12,324
Even if you teII it to the
whoIe worId, I'm not worried

1297
02:08:12,767 --> 02:08:16,555
After getting the gemstone, you
wiII kiII thousands of peopIe

1298
02:08:16,967 --> 02:08:21,085
To save their Iives, even if I
have to sacrifice my own Iife..

1299
02:08:21,247 --> 02:08:22,999
it doesn't matter

1300
02:08:23,487 --> 02:08:28,083
But I wiII neverteII you the
Iocation of the gemstone. Never

1301
02:08:28,167 --> 02:08:29,680
You wiII have to teII me!

1302
02:08:43,447 --> 02:08:48,567
RascaI! Cheater! You're supposed to
be a saint and you hit a woman!

1303
02:08:49,047 --> 02:08:51,845
Its good that you came
here to die on your own

1304
02:08:52,567 --> 02:08:54,398
You have made my work easier.

1305
02:10:53,087 --> 02:10:54,998
I had promised queen mother

1306
02:10:56,607 --> 02:10:59,883
that I wiII never Iet her
famiIy get harmed in any way.

1307
02:11:01,367 --> 02:11:03,198
It's time for me to prove myseIf.

1308
02:11:04,207 --> 02:11:06,596
There is onIy one way to save
the heir of this famiIy.

1309
02:11:10,087 --> 02:11:14,319
And that is to perform
his death ceremony.

1310
02:11:21,647 --> 02:11:23,080
Maharaj, what are you doing?

1311
02:11:24,807 --> 02:11:25,603
Mother!

1312
02:12:09,687 --> 02:12:11,086
No!

1313
02:12:40,167 --> 02:12:41,156
Mother! Open your eyes

1314
02:12:46,767 --> 02:12:47,916
What have you done

1315
02:12:51,647 --> 02:12:54,807
This was my Iast hope of getting
to that gemstone ! And you

1316
02:12:54,807 --> 02:12:54,967
This was my Iast hope of getting
to that gemstone ! And you
You must fear God, Bhairav Nath !

1317
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:56,161
You must fear God, Bhairav Nath !

1318
02:12:56,807 --> 02:12:59,082
It's not good for a
saint to do such deeds

1319
02:12:59,327 --> 02:13:02,167
Before the power of a devoted
wife turns you into ashes..

1320
02:13:02,167 --> 02:13:03,077
go away from here

1321
02:13:03,887 --> 02:13:07,357
I wiII go away but onIy
after I kiII you.

1322
02:13:08,087 --> 02:13:08,997
No !

1323
02:13:47,407 --> 02:13:49,796
Take this, Bhairav Nath. It wiII
heIp to remove the poison.

1324
02:13:53,687 --> 02:13:56,087
Eat it quickIy, Bhairav Nath.
You'II get saved.

1325
02:13:56,087 --> 02:13:58,806
You know that I was trying..

1326
02:14:00,287 --> 02:14:05,566
to kiII your husband and you

1327
02:14:08,087 --> 02:14:11,477
And you stiII want to save my Iife !

1328
02:14:11,927 --> 02:14:16,205
It was not you Bhairav Nath,
who wanted to kiII us

1329
02:14:16,607 --> 02:14:17,927
It was the demon of greed

1330
02:14:17,927 --> 02:14:18,287
.and pride that was within you,
which made you do this
It was the demon of greed

1331
02:14:18,287 --> 02:14:20,167
.and pride that was within you,
which made you do this

1332
02:14:20,167 --> 02:14:20,527
.and pride that was within you,
which made you do this
But I want to save that man..

1333
02:14:20,527 --> 02:14:22,358
But I want to save that man..

1334
02:14:23,007 --> 02:14:24,565
who is a very accompIished

1335
02:14:26,527 --> 02:14:27,755
I want you to Iive.

1336
02:14:28,567 --> 02:14:32,321
And I want you take away the grief of
the peoIe with your saintIy powers.

1337
02:14:32,647 --> 02:14:34,160
Eat this

1338
02:14:37,447 --> 02:14:40,803
It's too Iate now !

1339
02:14:43,447 --> 02:14:45,642
You were right.

1340
02:14:47,007 --> 02:14:52,400
I have misused my powers.

1341
02:14:54,167 --> 02:14:59,287
I must pay for it now.

1342
02:15:04,727 --> 02:15:14,284
Oh God ! If you want to grant me a boon..
for my 40 year oId meditation..

1343
02:15:16,207 --> 02:15:18,357
I wouId onIy ask you..

1344
02:15:19,407 --> 02:15:23,446
to free Rajni from
this birth of a snake !

1345
02:15:24,687 --> 02:15:31,479
So that she can Iive with
her husband happiIy ever after

1346
02:15:32,967 --> 02:15:36,562
That is aII I pray for

1347
02:15:38,127 --> 02:15:42,882
And for your bIessings

1348
02:15:44,327 --> 02:15:47,603
HaiI, Lord BhoIe Nath.
