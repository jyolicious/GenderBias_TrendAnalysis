1
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,328
Hey,even I'm coming...

2
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:20,774
How far...?

3
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:24,106
Yes,the path of love is
always like this

4
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:28,937
The more longer the way is the
more closer the traveler's come

5
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:40,118
And what's this-

6
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:45,293
Why do we always keep roaming in the
deserted ruins and broken building

7
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,132
Do you know

8
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:51,126
Every pillar,each and every
stone of this place

9
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:54,137
It's like... it's like revealing
a story

10
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:56,309
What happened?

11
00:01:57,845 --> 00:01:58,311
A thorn...

12
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:00,971
One minute... one minute...

13
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,312
Sapna,we'll not marry

14
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,490
Hey,but why,Is all your
love over?

15
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,158
It's not like that,if
we get married

16
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:17,490
Even we'll be left with no identity
of our own like other people

17
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,325
Who don't have any relation
among themselves

18
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:22,597
Who don't have any turn
in their lives

19
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,232
And,if we don't marry,then?

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,732
The love was left incomplete,only
then our story will be built

21
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:34,910
Hey what,should our story only be
built,why not our history?

22
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:39,643
Wow!whose Hero will be me and
whose Heroine will be you

23
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:34,627
Hey madam,don't you have eyes
Is there no humanity in you?

24
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:36,955
Don't you see,I'm chanting
hymns over here

25
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,889
And you're throwing the
peels of egg

26
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,563
Sinner... Sinner...
a great sinner...

27
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:41,062
What...?

28
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,168
What...? your head...

29
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,771
What... what's it,whom
are you threatening?

30
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:50,508
This is the same Maxim,you were
chanting hymns by closing your eyes

31
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,269
They came flying through the air
what can I do in that?

32
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,204
For your sake,should we stop
having eggs?

33
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:56,041
And start having grass
like you?

34
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:59,309
Even we don't have grass,only
your wisdom has it

35
00:05:59,486 --> 00:05:59,884
What...?

36
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,784
Oh God,if she's shouting
like that

37
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:04,820
Why are you also shouting
like this,you come in

38
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:07,583
Am I shouting,she's only shouting
after throwing the peels of the eggs

39
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:10,159
Hey Mr. what do you think?

40
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:12,628
Will I not understand anything
if you abuse me in Tamil?

41
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,528
I'm not going to lose
to you

42
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:17,067
Even,I'll abuse you one after the
other from the Terrace

43
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,736
What do you think?

44
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:21,438
Did you see...?

45
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:25,036
Oh madam,we're not
abusing you

46
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:28,840
I was just telling,why is this
fight required,you come in...

47
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:32,348
Yes... oh God! this is the
same Maxim

48
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:34,281
If they don't want to be
our neighbours

49
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,783
Let them go and settle down
in a forest

50
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:38,047
Again the same blabberings
the same old non-sense

51
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:41,618
You keep sticking your butt on
the chair like a pumpkin

52
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:42,920
By not uttering a word

53
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:45,624
Didn't you hear the way he
was shouting in Tamil?

54
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:50,259
Let him shout... He's a
Tamilian...

55
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:52,904
You say that you don't shout
but you always keep shouting

56
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:57,338
Yes... If they shout,will I remain
quiet,will I not swallow them up?

57
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:02,114
I know,if they are a brick
you're a stone

58
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,441
It is better to break my head
with a stone

59
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:06,615
Than to talk to you
since when I'm talking...

60
00:07:22,335 --> 00:07:24,462
The moment I start speaking,she
stops me by ringing an alarm

61
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,298
My daughter has found out
a good way

62
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,486
What do you want?

63
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,488
Have the notes of professor
Munshi Ram come?

64
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:47,493
No... If you want,I have
"Love's labour lost"

65
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:48,486
I don't want that

66
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:49,491
Sapna,one minute...

67
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:57,492
Look at this,it's a very interesting
book,just look at it...

68
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,348
What? why... how's the photo?

69
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:10,683
Is it your Mother's?

70
00:08:32,739 --> 00:08:36,539
Sir,haven't you seen the board
can't you get up?

71
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,374
Even if a woman comes and
stands next to you

72
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,210
Wow! If we say something
they'll start shouting

73
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:46,041
We'll damage the bus,burn the
bus and so on... get up...

74
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,721
I think,this poor man
doesn't know Hindi

75
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,391
Is it... sir... this seat is not meant
for men but only for ladies

76
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,225
The seat is vacant
come on...

77
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,069
It's on my head,that's
already gone...

78
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:12,905
Further,it's Dholapur,get down
there itself

79
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:16,912
This Isn't your Father's bus,that you
can make it stop as & when you feel like

80
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:20,916
Hey,this bus will not stop here
you'll have to go till Dholapur

81
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,930
Hey,why are you shouting,has
anybody committed a murder?

82
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,272
Don't know,from where he has come
the son of Tarzan?

83
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:00,626
Son,what's this,you've come
without any intimation?

84
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:03,129
First,I've come,the letter
is coming behind

85
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,797
Come my son,come...

86
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:07,800
Mr. Jagannath,what's this
why are you staring?

87
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:08,626
What?

88
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:10,636
Have you got lot of jokers?

89
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:14,466
No... sir,it's been 1 year since
I've had the glimpse of a joker

90
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:16,634
Look,who has come?

91
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,303
Hey what's this,all
of a sudden?

92
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:19,971
Who's he?

93
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:21,314
He's my son

94
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:22,310
Oh! your son

95
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:23,975
Hey,have you come on leave?

96
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,142
No...

97
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,487
What about the job?

98
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:32,325
What's the name of
your son?

99
00:10:36,363 --> 00:10:38,831
My name is Jagannath
I'm the owner of this house

100
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:41,167
I come for collecting the rent
but I go after paying

101
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:43,666
In the cards,I don't have
any other work

102
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,334
Very good,I didn't understand
a bit

103
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:46,163
Good,he has understood

104
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,507
Come on,play your card

105
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:53,342
How can I play,this Mr. has
quit his job

106
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:00,512
What an empty-pride?

107
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,189
Father,I don't have an empty-pride
my boss has it,he...

108
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:05,191
Will you keep quiet
for a while?

109
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:08,027
He badly scolded me,I told him
to take a long walk,and I quit

110
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,526
Hey,now-a-days,where it's so difficult
getting a job,have you got brains?

111
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,697
Father,I've brains...

112
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:14,700
Oh God! why all this fight when he's
just entered,you come in,my son...

113
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,027
I'll brush my teeth
- come...

114
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:21,203
Such a handsome boy
and your son...?

115
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:24,035
What handsome... my foot
he's a snake gourd...

116
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,042
Did you see,what times
have come

117
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,708
I educated him till B.Com,got him a
decent job in a good company

118
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:33,552
The boss must've spoken a
little harsh to him

119
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,888
Our man quit the job
and came off

120
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:38,050
Father is great fief
Isn't it

121
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,058
He's on his father,Isn't it

122
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:41,553
You've heard that saying
Isn't it

123
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,558
Like father,like son...

124
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,224
If not much,but at least
a little bit

125
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:12,249
What a strange man
you are?

126
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,252
Even after seeing me,you're
pretending as if you haven't

127
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:17,430
No talk,no shriek how's
your neighbour?

128
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,756
Whose leg you broke
out of anger

129
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,097
Poor soul,you didn't even think,that
he is the only son for his parents

130
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:24,429
That person,who's following me
to get rid of him

131
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:25,604
I'm posing my association
with you

132
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,269
Even you don't take it
in a wrong way

133
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:32,270
Our Goa boys are really very good
born volunteers...

134
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:34,613
They consider helping girls
as their prime duty

135
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:39,278
There are exceptions like him too
he's more like a beast than a human

136
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,119
I feel like hitting a stone
on his head

137
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:45,283
He ran away,bloody coward...

138
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,295
Probably,he got scared of you
thank you so much

139
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,627
Had you not been there,don't know
what would've happened?

140
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:57,133
I don't like coming by this way
but what to do,it's a short-cut

141
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,135
That's my college,okay...

142
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:02,975
But why were you running
like this?

143
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:06,645
Are you a dumb?

144
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:10,475
Even the God has strange
plays

145
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:12,651
You can not speak...?

146
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:17,145
I don't know Hindi
- Then?

147
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,158
Whatever you may be,but you're
a messenger of God for me

148
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:26,161
"Messenger of God"

149
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:41,506
That's why,I say,to teach
a lesson to such Rowdies

150
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:43,682
It's very important that
girls learn Karate

151
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:46,181
Just imagine,if there's
a rowdy come for somewhere

152
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,348
You see him and vice-versa
he stops and you too

153
00:13:50,723 --> 00:13:51,849
He takes a step forward
towards you

154
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:54,189
And you start...

155
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:57,363
Karate was introduced only
for self-protection

156
00:13:57,897 --> 00:13:59,865
I don't know,whether karate
was born in Japan

157
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:00,862
Or it was imparted
from India

158
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:04,036
You have seen that, Bruce Lee's
Enter the Dragon, isn't it

159
00:14:47,447 --> 00:14:51,907
My name is Vasu,what's
your name?

160
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:05,931
Greetings sir...

161
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:06,757
Greetings...

162
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,616
Hey,the visiting hours got over
long back

163
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,447
Haven't you people
still gone?

164
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:32,955
We're going... we don't want to stay
the whole night at your hospital

165
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:37,122
My dear,I'll leave,tomorrow
morning I'll come with a coffee

166
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,297
Come with a good coffee

167
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:41,800
Here,no body even knows to make
coffee,I'll leave...

168
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:54,806
You save this thanks for that
girl who has sent these flowers

169
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:56,315
I've only brought them

170
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:22,506
Your name is very good,my name
is Sapna,how's it?

171
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:53,530
This is my Veedu(House)

172
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,040
What?

173
00:16:58,578 --> 00:16:59,203
That's my house

174
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,547
No... my veedu(House)

175
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:03,716
Oh! that Non-veg. family

176
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,389
We've come so closer
to each other...

177
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,387
What do you do?

178
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,336
Are you fine?

179
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,004
Meaning?

180
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:12,503
Meaning?

181
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:20,348
It means...

182
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,710
Mr. Jagannath,did you see...
our noses have got burnt

183
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:57,214
Because of the bad smell
of their food

184
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:00,552
One day,they have eggs,one day
mutton,one day chicken...

185
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:05,557
Don't they get the taste in their food
unless they commit a murder?

186
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:07,899
Mr. Jagannath,you yourself
tell-

187
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,235
Should we stay in this house
or vacate it?

188
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:11,570
I can't tolerate any more

189
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:13,398
Good,let them vacate,we'll
get rid of them

190
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:17,231
This is the same Maxim,they
are Tenants and we're the Owners

191
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,578
In my house,I'll do anything
which I feel like

192
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:23,074
What's an egg,out of anger,I may even
fry my husband and eat

193
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,579
Who's he to ask?

194
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,920
Madam,you eat your husband
however you feel like

195
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,916
But let us live,why can't you
change the direction of your kitchen?

196
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,919
Why can't you chop your head
and keep it in a cupboard?

197
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:36,261
The kitchen will be
very much there

198
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,590
Should we change our kitchen
for these Tamilians? never...

199
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:43,590
You always bring South Indians &
North Indians as the bone of contention

200
00:20:44,136 --> 00:20:46,263
I know,all North Indian
are not like you

201
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,267
Even I know that all South Indians
are not like you

202
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:27,639
Even if we don't call a Rose
as a Rose

203
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:29,982
Will Rose become some
other flower?

204
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,978
What's there in a name
it's all in our mind-

205
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:40,653
It's not a part of our body,like
Head,Hand,Leg,Nose,Ear...

206
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:46,160
When you address
yourself as"I"

207
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,667
A lot of things are included
in this"I"

208
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:53,494
Body,Soul,Heart,Brain
name is just a mere label

209
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,668
Like,even if we don't call
Romeo as Romeo

210
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:59,671
But still,he'll remain only as
Romeo,Juliet's lover

211
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:04,171
Leave all this,your mother never
addresses me by my name

212
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:07,512
But this doesn't mean that
I'm no more her husband

213
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:21,199
What's the meaning of this?

214
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:27,362
It means,good night
Daddy,I'm feeling sleepy

215
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,566
What's it?

216
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:56,230
What's it?

217
00:22:58,437 --> 00:22:59,233
No...

218
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:02,741
"Love"

219
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:06,745
What account is this?

220
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:13,074
This is the account
of the heart

221
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:31,098
Now, where has the love
disappeared?

222
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:33,100
It has got merged with the sand

223
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:34,268
In this?

224
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:51,119
What's this, is this a rehearsal of
getting burried alive like Anarkali?

225
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:56,951
No... I'm just seeing,that is
there any other lover like us inside?

226
00:23:57,329 --> 00:23:59,456
Here,you'll not find lovers
but you'll find only crabs

227
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:00,298
What?

228
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,468
A crab... is crawling on my hand

229
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,979
It's not a crab, it's my hand
it's my finger...

230
00:24:29,862 --> 00:24:31,830
Oh God... DOG...

231
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:35,500
DOG... DOG

232
00:24:37,036 --> 00:24:38,833
It's only a DOG,Isn't it
what can it do?

233
00:24:39,371 --> 00:24:42,829
What the DOG's generally do,if it
thinks us to be a lamp post,then?

234
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:44,839
Yuck...

235
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:54,352
When ever you meet me,you say
"Are you fine"

236
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:55,349
What's the meaning
of this?

237
00:24:56,055 --> 00:24:58,523
Meaning... Are you fine?

238
00:24:59,058 --> 00:25:02,357
I see... how to say in Tamil
that"I'm fine"?

239
00:25:03,229 --> 00:25:05,026
I'm fine

240
00:25:05,564 --> 00:25:06,531
" NALLA IRUKEN"(I AM FINE)

241
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:10,194
Not like that
like this...

242
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:10,868
Oh! like this...

243
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:16,705
Are you fine? I'm fine...

244
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:18,710
Why have you come here?

245
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:22,039
I was seeing how beautiful
you are

246
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:23,545
Yuck... run from here

247
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,219
Mother... Are you fine?

248
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:32,716
What?

249
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:45,069
Learn Tamil in 30 days,do
you have this book?

250
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:45,896
It's there

251
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,907
What can I do for you?

252
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,573
Learn Tamil in 30 days
do you have this book?

253
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:54,075
Pregnancy in 10 days,I've
this book-

254
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,578
How can a woman experience motherhood
how fast can she experience?

255
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,417
What is the way if she
doesn't want to experience?-

256
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:00,585
That book contains
all these

257
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:03,080
Tamil is the language
confined only to Madras city

258
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:05,753
But sex is a universal
language

259
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:11,422
That day,you had told that
this is my Mother's photo

260
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:17,258
Now,look at it,how's it?

261
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:47,552
What is this strange bond that
we share between ourselves?

262
00:27:53,232 --> 00:27:58,363
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

263
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:44,246
One string pulls and the
second comes running

264
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,421
It'll come tied by the pull
of brittle strings

265
00:28:56,795 --> 00:29:05,601
Like a mad lover

266
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:28,626
Oh! Is it like that?

267
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:31,625
Oh! as if you've understood
everything

268
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:57,986
I'll wear bracelets from
your hands

269
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:08,993
The final destination of my Bridal cart
will be at your courtyard

270
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:21,640
Let the world do anything...

271
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:41,866
Hey,you're extremely
beautiful

272
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:44,862
What's all this?

273
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,901
People speak so many
different languages

274
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:31,079
But there's only one language of "Love"
in the world

275
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:39,922
Which the candle stick speaks
to the winged white Ant

276
00:31:50,802 --> 00:31:52,599
Not bad,you sing
pretty well

277
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:53,596
What?

278
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:54,768
You...

279
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,011
What you did was
not love

280
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:17,184
The one which can not rise
above sex and lust

281
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:20,684
That's not true love,you're
not fit for that

282
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,188
I thought you as my friend
as my companion

283
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,358
But you too turned out to be
an ordinary man like others

284
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:30,034
And an ordinary man is just
slightly superior to an Animal

285
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:36,370
This is our last meeting
we'll never meet up again

286
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:39,870
Now,I regret,why
I met you?

287
00:33:58,597 --> 00:33:59,393
What's all this?

288
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:01,725
Old news papers and
waste papers

289
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,560
I was told to sell it
to a junk dealer

290
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:04,727
Who?

291
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:06,070
Sapna madam

292
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:08,740
And even that?

293
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:44,621
Why,have I committed
any mistake?

294
00:37:46,992 --> 00:37:52,294
No... only the place of
your kiss was wrong

295
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:10,140
So,the separation of these 7 days
has still brought us closer

296
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,983
There are 2 things very
exiting in love

297
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:18,822
Separation and...

298
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:20,983
Waiting...

299
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:28,159
This rock is a memorial for the
await of a girl called Donapoala

300
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:32,169
History itself is like this

301
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:36,173
A portuguese girl fell in love
with a Goan boy

302
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:37,667
Like us...?

303
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:39,670
Yes,exactly like us

304
00:38:40,378 --> 00:38:43,347
One day,the boy had to go
very far across the Sea

305
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:44,340
But...

306
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,178
He had to go across
the Sea...

307
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:50,513
But he never returned

308
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,688
Why,what happened to him
no body knows

309
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,025
But the girl kept constantly
waiting for him...

310
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,697
Then,after standing on
this Rock

311
00:39:01,566 --> 00:39:02,863
She herself became a Rock

312
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,698
And one day,even
If I go

313
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,197
Will you also wait for me
on this Rock?

314
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,536
No need of all this
Rubbish things

315
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:12,376
First I want to make good
the loss for 7 days

316
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:13,703
When how and where?

317
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:18,204
Okay,for 7 days,I'll
sit besides you

318
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:19,041
Is it okay?

319
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,052
Even 7 days are not required
only 24 hours

320
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:26,216
Should we go somewhere for a hitch-hiking
I'll show you the entire Goa

321
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,222
What okay... what about
your Mother?

322
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:31,729
Keep quiet man

323
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,394
Just watch,how I'll manage
with my Mother

324
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:39,619
We are made for each other

325
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:54,472
I swear upon him,even if I stay
for a moment away from him

326
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:29,170
You are stupid,accept it,you are
handsome,understand it

327
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:40,351
Leaving all other things
recognise the eyes

328
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:44,525
Eyes have made such promises
to each other

329
00:43:36,507 --> 00:43:41,638
There is no way of
expressing love

330
00:43:42,013 --> 00:43:44,811
That's why poet Ghalib
has told this

331
00:43:45,183 --> 00:43:53,648
We are made for each other
understood?

332
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:46,036
Madam, why are you crying?

333
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:48,208
If you cry will you reach
home early?

334
00:44:48,913 --> 00:44:51,711
Then tell me, how will we go
the watch is showing 11 o'clock

335
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,543
The board is showing 16 kms.

336
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:56,049
The petrol is over and we
are also financially broke

337
00:44:56,254 --> 00:45:00,213
I spoke a lie at home and came
now,it's mid-night

338
00:45:00,758 --> 00:45:02,225
The watch is 5 minutes
fast

339
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:16,903
Sir,will you give us lift
till PANJIM?

340
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,407
Husband wife and the motorcycle
had gone to Vasco-Da-gama for honeymoon

341
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:27,743
But there was a pick pocket
the petrol is exhausted

342
00:45:48,306 --> 00:45:50,274
Even I had gone to Vasco-Da-gama
on a marriage

343
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:52,443
In the mean time,you even
got married to him?

344
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:54,607
What's your name?

345
00:45:54,812 --> 00:45:56,780
Why do you need name,you can
abuse me just like that

346
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,107
So much of haughtiness?-

347
00:45:58,316 --> 00:46:00,784
Making a young girl speak a
lie at home and bringing her out

348
00:46:00,985 --> 00:46:02,612
And making her roam like a
Vagabond,Is this a joke?

349
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:07,116
In future,if you look at our house
I'll not only abuse you,but...

350
00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:11,787
Sapna,get into the car
come...

351
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:17,468
Poor soul,Vasu...

352
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:20,296
He'll come back running behind
the car, he's a hero, isn't it

353
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:22,465
Driver,start the car
- Sir...

354
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:24,300
Are you deaf,start
the car

355
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:34,144
We are made for each other
understood?

356
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:21,361
Sorry Vasu,you came walking all
the way in the night

357
00:47:21,566 --> 00:47:23,363
Walking... and me...? Never...

358
00:47:23,568 --> 00:47:25,195
Then,how did you come?
- On the motor bike

359
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:26,028
And petrol?

360
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:27,363
Why is petrol required?

361
00:47:27,572 --> 00:47:29,699
I was on the motorbike
the motorbike was on the lorry

362
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:32,205
And the lorry charges
were on my father

363
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,379
You had to take so much
of trouble for my sake

364
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,376
Trouble...?

365
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:39,883
I can do anything for you

366
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:41,210
Anything

367
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:44,388
Everything,our's is an
Immortal love,Isn't it

368
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:45,715
Now,tell me,what
should I do?

369
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:48,392
Do you know swimming?

370
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:50,385
What is that?

371
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:55,055
Jump... let me see...?

372
00:47:58,936 --> 00:47:59,800
It's an Immortal love
Isn't it?

373
00:48:22,593 --> 00:48:25,926
Someone please save... somebody
is drowning in the water...

374
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:33,268
He doesn't know swimming,someone
please save... please save...

375
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:45,908
I went to catch fish
I caught him

376
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:47,448
Just see,if he's breathing
or not?

377
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:49,345
Vasu,regain consciousness

378
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:59,192
Vasu, I accept that your Love
for me is immortal

379
00:49:11,742 --> 00:49:12,800
Hey,don't shake!

380
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:16,609
What are you writing?

381
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:20,313
I saw your back as shining
as a Glass

382
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:22,508
I thought,let me write
a Love letter

383
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:26,146
Are you writing some joke,it's
making me laugh

384
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,151
Hey,wait for sometime

385
00:49:33,698 --> 00:49:34,357
It's over...

386
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:35,657
What have you written?

387
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,723
Read it yourself

388
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,535
Hey,tell me,what have
you written?

389
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:45,500
I'll not tell

390
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,843
You'll not tell
- No

391
00:49:48,212 --> 00:49:50,703
Alright,I'll tell someone
else to read it

392
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:53,413
Will you make someone else
read a love letter?

393
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:58,512
I'll not tell it to a stranger
I'll tell my mother to read it

394
00:49:58,856 --> 00:49:59,515
To Mother...?

395
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:07,363
Mother...

396
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:13,361
What do you want?

397
00:50:14,905 --> 00:50:16,338
It's been how many years since
you've come to North India?

398
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,672
It's been 6 years
but why?

399
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:23,470
It's been 6 years,Isn't it
do you know to read & write Hindi?

400
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:25,108
Hey,what's this,today you
are speaking in Hindi?

401
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,580
First tell me,can you
read Hindi?

402
00:50:28,152 --> 00:50:28,743
Little bit

403
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,745
Only little bit,Isn't it,okay
then read this little bit

404
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:39,893
I Love you,"a mad girl"

405
00:50:40,364 --> 00:50:42,264
Oh!God,who's that mad girl?

406
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:45,125
The adjacent house mad girl
Sapna...

407
00:50:45,936 --> 00:50:48,962
That Girl...?who are they
and who are we?

408
00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:50,240
Is it Practically possible?

409
00:50:50,474 --> 00:50:51,406
How's this possible?

410
00:50:51,942 --> 00:50:56,345
If you think,it's possible,Oh God!
Mother... where are your feet?

411
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:00,078
Oh!God!...

412
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:02,916
What...?- Turn back...
- But why?

413
00:51:03,287 --> 00:51:06,120
Mangalam,what are you doing?

414
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:07,952
I'm oil massaging the child

415
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:10,757
You're applying oil,let 10 more
years pass off

416
00:51:11,629 --> 00:51:13,597
Mr. Jagannath,come here
- Coming

417
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,600
Look,what's going on
over here?

418
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:21,933
She's oil massaging a 20 years
old Donkey

419
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:27,438
If he's given such a Royal treatment
will he ever go out for work?

420
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:30,644
You get him a job,is he
refusing for it?

421
00:51:32,817 --> 00:51:33,283
Wow!

422
00:51:47,498 --> 00:51:47,987
Stop!

423
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:52,997
Sapna,I never expected
this from you

424
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:55,638
I never ever thought that you'll
turn out to be such a girl

425
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,838
Daddy,what type of a Girl?

426
00:51:58,175 --> 00:52:00,973
The way you are
you know my anger

427
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:04,474
I'm watching the drama going
on between father & daughter

428
00:52:05,182 --> 00:52:06,979
Father,is uttering false words
of displease

429
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,852
And the daughter is pretending
to be innocent

430
00:52:10,287 --> 00:52:11,549
Mother,what do you
want to say?

431
00:52:12,123 --> 00:52:14,819
I don't want to say but I want to
ask you,what's all this?

432
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:21,557
Now,why have you become
speechless?

433
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:22,332
Come on say!

434
00:52:23,834 --> 00:52:27,326
The photo is good,give him Rs. 10
and ask him to get out

435
00:52:28,572 --> 00:52:30,233
Had it been in colour,it would've
still been better

436
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,100
Shameless,now tell me,how many
colours are you able to see?

437
00:52:33,844 --> 00:52:36,278
I'm asking her about the photo
she's giving me all stupid answers

438
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:38,241
Has she become so great?

439
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:42,218
Only now,I've come to know,what
you do staying outside so late

440
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,354
She's born only to put a blemish
on our forehead

441
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,187
From tomorrow,if you don't
come straight home after college

442
00:52:48,392 --> 00:52:49,256
I'll break your legs
understood?

443
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:54,763
She-devil,what are you looking at
me for,get away from my sight

444
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:23,920
I'll come in the evening to
pick you up,understood

445
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,758
Vasu,why did you come here?

446
00:53:57,962 --> 00:53:59,589
What other way is there
to meet you?

447
00:53:59,964 --> 00:54:01,261
Your mother has become
your Body-Guard

448
00:54:01,966 --> 00:54:03,934
She always conceals you
in her saree

449
00:54:04,134 --> 00:54:05,328
Vasu,what can I do?

450
00:54:05,536 --> 00:54:07,436
I can do,come with me
- Now...?

451
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:11,498
But mother...?

452
00:54:12,676 --> 00:54:13,938
Mother comes only in the evening
Isn't it...

453
00:54:25,856 --> 00:54:27,289
The food was too good
my stomach is dead

454
00:54:28,158 --> 00:54:28,783
What,stomach...?

455
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:29,625
Is dead!

456
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:34,223
Not dead,but fully filled

457
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,797
Hindi is a very difficult
language

458
00:54:38,669 --> 00:54:40,466
Are you not having
the ice-cream?- No

459
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:43,638
My hair has become full

460
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:45,475
Hair...?

461
00:54:46,176 --> 00:54:46,642
Yes...

462
00:54:48,846 --> 00:54:49,870
You mean to say,stomach
Isn't it

463
00:54:50,114 --> 00:54:50,546
Yes...

464
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:57,152
Not Hair... but stomach

465
00:54:57,955 --> 00:54:59,149
What's there to laugh
on this?

466
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:02,358
What you said was hair

467
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:06,993
Tamil is a very difficult
language

468
00:55:22,746 --> 00:55:24,771
What's this,why have you stopped
the lift in between?

469
00:55:26,517 --> 00:55:30,009
To be with you for a
very long time

470
00:55:30,754 --> 00:55:33,052
I have my Hindi
poetry class

471
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:38,691
It's Hindi Poetry class,Isn't it
I'll teach you

472
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:40,863
You?... and Hindi Poem...?

473
00:55:42,966 --> 00:55:44,763
Do you think,I don't
know Hindi Poem?

474
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:55,541
My life partner,keep loving!

475
00:55:56,814 --> 00:56:01,376
Youth is mad,beautiful
obstinate female neighbour

476
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:03,885
TRUTH,POWER and BEAUTY

477
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:06,222
Benhur!... that's an
English Movie...

478
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:29,746
My life partner,keep loving...
Wow!... wow!

479
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:47,253
Youth is mad,beautiful
obstinate female neighbour

480
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:57,771
TRUTH,POWER and Beauty

481
00:57:00,477 --> 00:57:01,444
Bloody lier...

482
00:57:01,812 --> 00:57:02,608
Bloody lier?...

483
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:08,611
Yuck 420,Vagabond

484
00:57:09,486 --> 00:57:14,788
It's only my heart...
I'm the lover of beauty

485
00:57:15,092 --> 00:57:18,459
Our dreams,infront of
your house

486
00:57:18,762 --> 00:57:22,220
Face to face,after marriage

487
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:24,128
After marriage,Oh!God!

488
00:57:26,336 --> 00:57:29,134
Our's...
- What...?

489
00:57:29,706 --> 00:57:36,635
Baby,Guddi,Tinku,Mini,Shin
Shinati Babla Boo,out of play...

490
00:57:37,014 --> 00:57:39,141
Shout...

491
00:57:41,785 --> 00:57:42,217
Have you forgotten?

492
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:49,491
My name is Johnny-I see...
Robbing is my profession...

493
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:51,152
Ram and Shyam

494
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:52,486
Yuck... good for nothing

495
00:57:52,696 --> 00:57:56,860
Girl... Meeting...
keep singing a song...

496
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:57,658
Shameless

497
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:01,696
The season of love
- Shameless...

498
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:19,681
Go... Go...

499
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:04,095
Love... Love... Love...

500
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:14,741
These paths are of love
by walking my companion

501
00:59:14,945 --> 00:59:15,411
What?

502
00:59:15,779 --> 00:59:22,082
Companion,you're mad in love
mad,care-free,fraud,unknown

503
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:23,743
Bloody,mad man...

504
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:29,284
Fraud,unknown,lover,stranger
Loafer,stupid

505
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:36,261
The one which grows is a Beard
the one which moves is a vehicle

506
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:41,264
When some one falls in love
my lover...

507
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:46,608
When we get some one's
remembrance,my lover

508
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:47,276
Really?

509
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:51,102
Bond,Bracelets,a Sandal Wood Swing
Sandal,Bracelets,a Bond Swing

510
00:59:51,315 --> 00:59:54,614
A swing of Bond,A Bracelet of Swing
A swing of Sandalwood,swing... swing...

511
00:59:54,818 --> 00:59:58,185
I lend my heart,I took the pain
The sound of tinkling Anklets...

512
00:59:58,422 --> 01:00:03,121
With the sound of the tappings
The stones sang a song,the 7 notes...

513
01:00:03,894 --> 01:00:14,293
TRUTH,POWER and Beauty...

514
01:00:20,043 --> 01:00:20,805
Go... Go...

515
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,189
Wow!what an excellent duet
they sang

516
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:25,033
What's your father's name?

517
01:01:27,577 --> 01:01:28,043
Sir,I forgot...

518
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:31,374
Bloody rascal,you're not worthy
of finding a job for yourself

519
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:32,548
Why do you want love...?

520
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:33,382
Love?...

521
01:01:34,384 --> 01:01:36,079
We love each other

522
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,216
Did you see,he's wantonly
replying in Hindi

523
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,619
We're not left worthy of
showing our face outside

524
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,789
In broad day light and
that too in a public place

525
01:01:44,161 --> 01:01:45,958
Why do you need to sing a song
Just like in a movie...

526
01:01:46,797 --> 01:01:48,594
We love each other

527
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,230
Didn't you feel ashamed?

528
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:54,163
For so long,you were inside
the lift with a stranger

529
01:01:54,604 --> 01:01:56,401
First,give me an answer
then,you go in

530
01:01:57,174 --> 01:01:58,573
We both love each other

531
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:04,645
Let your love get ruined...
this is the same Maxim

532
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:07,312
Where has that Rascal come from
to put us to shame?

533
01:02:07,517 --> 01:02:09,747
He should die of cholera
he should die a Dog's death

534
01:02:12,889 --> 01:02:15,915
I'm asking you,what's your age... that
you're roaming around with a stranger?

535
01:02:16,293 --> 01:02:16,759
Tell me...?

536
01:02:17,194 --> 01:02:18,593
We both love each other

537
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:21,420
But,who's this Mr. Haribabu?

538
01:02:21,932 --> 01:02:23,661
Mr. Haribabu is a very good
friend of mine

539
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:27,002
Yes... he's a very big
Auditor in Hyderabad

540
01:02:27,204 --> 01:02:28,831
So,will Vasu work
in Hyderabad?

541
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,097
Yes... yes

542
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,108
I'll not got to Hyderabad
- Why?

543
01:02:33,877 --> 01:02:35,936
I'll not go,that's it,get me
some job in Goa itself

544
01:02:36,713 --> 01:02:37,611
That's all,I'll not go

545
01:02:38,482 --> 01:02:40,279
Son,you should go...

546
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,448
Why, son...?

547
01:02:41,918 --> 01:02:44,716
He doesn't want a job
he only wants a girl

548
01:02:46,223 --> 01:02:47,986
Why are you talking like this
- You, keep quiet

549
01:02:49,659 --> 01:02:51,718
Jullie,the only difference
between us is that

550
01:02:53,163 --> 01:02:55,961
You have a collar around your
neck and I don't have

551
01:02:57,067 --> 01:03:00,901
If I keep watching at you like this
I think,one day,I'll go mad

552
01:03:01,705 --> 01:03:04,139
And probably,I'll start
barking like you

553
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:07,969
This dog's face is thousand times
better than that Rascal's

554
01:03:08,645 --> 01:03:09,805
Mother,it's okay,if it's
only the Dog

555
01:03:10,213 --> 01:03:12,477
But,I've to see even your face
for all the 24 hours

556
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,885
You'll go mad by looking
at that Dog

557
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:24,093
This is the same Maxim

558
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:27,494
Look,how that loafer is taking
circles around our house

559
01:03:28,031 --> 01:03:30,158
He should die of cholera,only then
we can get rid of him

560
01:03:41,478 --> 01:03:43,742
Do you want to show the entire
city the act of your shamefulness?

561
01:03:44,047 --> 01:03:47,346
Come... come and sit
there properly

562
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:52,053
Otherwise,I'll cut you into pieces and
throw it down to that Dog,understood...

563
01:04:25,989 --> 01:04:28,549
Sapna,why were you not seen
the entire day?

564
01:04:33,697 --> 01:04:35,187
Have your family members
house arrested you?

565
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:36,899
Tell me?

566
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:41,094
Did they beat you?

567
01:04:48,345 --> 01:04:51,837
Sapna,don't cry,no body
can separate us

568
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:53,406
The entire world...

569
01:04:55,518 --> 01:04:56,917
Let the entire world
turn against us

570
01:04:57,387 --> 01:04:58,581
Even then,we both
will be one

571
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,753
What are you looking at?

572
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:06,522
Let me see,what these
people can do?

573
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:14,733
Got ruined... we are
left no where

574
01:05:14,938 --> 01:05:16,929
My daughter's life has
got ruined

575
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,108
The respect of this family
has gone to Dogs

576
01:05:19,342 --> 01:05:20,741
Is there no one,who can
stop him?

577
01:05:20,944 --> 01:05:24,175
Is there no respected person who
can save someone else's respect?

578
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:25,436
Hey,where are you?

579
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:35,549
In the world's history of Love
this chapter is not for the first time

580
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:37,620
This comes everytime

581
01:05:38,862 --> 01:05:41,228
The young love understands
only one language

582
01:05:42,132 --> 01:05:42,962
The language of Love

583
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:46,302
The old wisdom,burried into
the grave of time

584
01:05:46,503 --> 01:05:48,266
Only know to create the
walls of separation

585
01:05:49,072 --> 01:05:51,905
Some times,the walls of languages
sometimes,the walls of caste

586
01:05:52,676 --> 01:05:55,907
Sometimes,the walls of wealth
sometimes,the walls of hatred

587
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,214
From the time,History
is in practice

588
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:03,317
From then,this fight between the
young & old is also being practiced

589
01:06:04,354 --> 01:06:06,481
Neither,the old has taken
it's last breath

590
01:06:07,324 --> 01:06:09,315
Nor the young has accepted
it's defeat

591
01:06:13,997 --> 01:06:20,425
We Love each other,we'll get
married,nobody can stop us

592
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:25,832
After this... now you can say
whatever you feel like

593
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:31,006
You people are elder to us
in age and also in experience

594
01:06:31,381 --> 01:06:34,873
But still,there is not even one
who can peep into our heart's

595
01:06:35,285 --> 01:06:36,115
And try understand us

596
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:39,177
They don't understand us,because
we respect them

597
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:40,554
We treat them as
our elders

598
01:06:40,957 --> 01:06:42,891
Had Vasu stealthily eloped
with me

599
01:06:43,226 --> 01:06:44,523
Then,what you people could
have done?

600
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:48,622
What ever we have done

601
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:50,691
We've confined ourselves to the
limitations of respect

602
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:52,591
Had we crossed those limits

603
01:06:52,802 --> 01:06:54,861
You couldn't have uttered a
word out of shame, isn't it

604
01:06:55,238 --> 01:06:56,205
Scoundrel,shut your mouth

605
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,265
Having born in a orthodox
brahmin family

606
01:06:59,776 --> 01:07:02,244
Do you want to marry a girl who
eat's non-veg?

607
01:07:02,979 --> 01:07:03,775
Aren't you ashamed of it?

608
01:07:04,914 --> 01:07:06,575
I'll stop eating non-veg.

609
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:09,780
Oh! such a big sacrifice?

610
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:15,053
Oh God!...

611
01:07:15,525 --> 01:07:16,549
Then,will you be satisfied?

612
01:07:16,893 --> 01:07:18,861
Did you listen,this is all the
tricks of these Tamilians

613
01:07:20,196 --> 01:07:21,220
This is the same Maxim

614
01:07:21,464 --> 01:07:24,194
Why should we get our daughter
married to these Tamilian's Son?

615
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:26,232
Do we fall short of boys
in our city?

616
01:07:28,638 --> 01:07:29,832
Again the same old fight
of language?

617
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:33,071
If language is the only
objection for you people

618
01:07:34,544 --> 01:07:36,569
Then give me 1 month's time

619
01:07:37,113 --> 01:07:39,411
I'll learn Hindi and I'll also
be able to teach you

620
01:07:39,749 --> 01:07:43,241
I'll even write poetry in
Hindi and show you

621
01:07:43,953 --> 01:07:44,749
Oh yes... poem...

622
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:52,385
Son,you'll definitely write,but with
cowdung on our forehead

623
01:07:52,762 --> 01:07:55,253
Your parents have given you birth
only for this Auspicious deed

624
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:55,931
Listen...

625
01:07:56,266 --> 01:07:57,062
Please be quiet for
some time

626
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:01,433
Look,they are anyways children
but,we're elders...

627
01:08:01,638 --> 01:08:03,538
What,even if we don't
behave as elders?

628
01:08:04,507 --> 01:08:07,067
We must think as to what
has to be done

629
01:08:07,644 --> 01:08:08,770
What should we do?

630
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,945
First,take your hands off
first take your hands off...

631
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:19,453
What's the love at this age
It's only Lust

632
01:08:20,123 --> 01:08:21,112
Lust!... my foot...

633
01:08:22,192 --> 01:08:25,161
This word,every father,since
generations in repeating it

634
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:27,955
Even this mistake,every son since
generations is making it

635
01:08:28,164 --> 01:08:31,327
But every father forgets the fact
that he was also a son

636
01:08:31,901 --> 01:08:33,892
You'll not understand this till
you become a father

637
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:37,001
That's why,I'm asking you to
get me married

638
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,570
Bloody Rascal,I'll break
your jaw

639
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:42,439
He's speaking to me
in Hindi?

640
01:08:44,747 --> 01:08:47,545
Why all this is required
our's is true love

641
01:08:47,884 --> 01:08:50,375
Tell us,what are we supposed
to do to prove it?

642
01:08:50,587 --> 01:08:51,747
We are ready to do

643
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:04,593
Look sir,If you agree,I'll give
you all a suggestion

644
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:07,563
Separate both of them
for a year

645
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:10,940
And even after that,If they want
to marry each other

646
01:09:11,141 --> 01:09:14,406
Then,we'll agree,that their love
is only love and not Lust

647
01:09:20,183 --> 01:09:21,810
Why,what do you think?

648
01:09:22,118 --> 01:09:25,246
I see... after that,will we
have to get them married?

649
01:09:25,622 --> 01:09:26,350
Go...

650
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,515
Not only 1 year,even after
100 years

651
01:09:29,826 --> 01:09:31,191
I'll not agree for their marriage

652
01:09:31,394 --> 01:09:32,224
It's impossible

653
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:37,557
Wo are you to say this,first I'm
telling,that I don't agree for this proposal

654
01:09:37,767 --> 01:09:39,029
It's impossible by me

655
01:09:39,335 --> 01:09:42,099
How is this Jagannath affected by it
he'll blabber,whatever he feels like

656
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:44,739
He has no one around him,he
has no children... and so on...

657
01:09:45,008 --> 01:09:48,808
Sister,don't refuse so early
give a little more thought

658
01:09:50,613 --> 01:09:53,241
Yes my dear,we should definitely
give a due thought

659
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:56,210
Even Jagannath's suggestion
looks practical

660
01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:58,553
Why Vasu,Is it okay?

661
01:09:58,755 --> 01:10:00,382
It's not okay,mother,why
all this is required?

662
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,716
Is this any kind of examination?

663
01:10:01,925 --> 01:10:03,552
We outrightly refuse it

664
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:09,057
Vasu,why don't we agree,are we
scared of their examination?

665
01:10:10,099 --> 01:10:12,397
Let them try their best,our love
for each other will not decrease

666
01:10:13,436 --> 01:10:17,065
Our love will not diminish
this is my firm belief

667
01:10:17,273 --> 01:10:21,232
Is it,then for 1 year they
can-not meet with each other...

668
01:10:22,278 --> 01:10:24,075
They can not talk
to each other

669
01:10:24,447 --> 01:10:25,243
Alright

670
01:10:25,448 --> 01:10:27,245
They can't even exchange letters
between themselves

671
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:28,246
Alright

672
01:10:29,118 --> 01:10:31,586
They shouldn't even stay in
the same city

673
01:10:32,455 --> 01:10:33,922
I'll send him to Hyderabad

674
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:36,091
Oh! so finally,you found
an opportunity

675
01:10:37,293 --> 01:10:39,420
You've decided among yourselves
that's all...

676
01:10:39,963 --> 01:10:40,930
We...

677
01:10:42,966 --> 01:10:47,426
Vasu,what's there in it,why are you
so obstinate about it?

678
01:10:47,971 --> 01:10:48,767
Agree...

679
01:10:52,141 --> 01:10:52,937
You don't understand

680
01:10:53,142 --> 01:10:55,110
No Vasu,I only...

681
01:10:55,478 --> 01:10:58,606
You leave about their opinion,first,we'll
have to take a decision,come

682
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,612
Why,can't you take the decision
over here?

683
01:11:00,817 --> 01:11:04,617
No.. here,It'll end up
in smoke

684
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:12,616
I hate this business of
proving something

685
01:11:12,996 --> 01:11:15,123
Who are others to make us
prove our love?

686
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:19,961
Vasu,they are not other's,they are our
parent's,who gave us birth

687
01:11:20,169 --> 01:11:22,137
Who brought us up

688
01:11:22,505 --> 01:11:24,302
Their blessings will definitely
be good for us

689
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:25,637
It'll not be bad

690
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:27,806
Vasu,listen to me
carefully

691
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,976
There are 3 things very
important for love

692
01:11:31,514 --> 01:11:34,972
Good manners,little patience and
a lot of mental balance

693
01:11:35,685 --> 01:11:36,811
Vasu,agree to their conditions

694
01:11:37,687 --> 01:11:40,315
I have full faith,by the
grace of this God

695
01:11:40,857 --> 01:11:42,324
We'll come out with flying colours
in this examination

696
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:43,321
But...

697
01:11:44,694 --> 01:11:45,661
Agree for my sake...

698
01:11:50,033 --> 01:11:53,992
But these elder's are too clever
they can even deceive us in the end

699
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,338
That's why,it's has to be written
black & white on a paper

700
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:58,507
That after 1 year,they'll get
us married

701
01:11:58,708 --> 01:12:00,676
And on that,their...

702
01:12:01,878 --> 01:12:03,004
We should even take their
signatures

703
01:12:03,212 --> 01:12:04,008
You mean to say,an agreement?

704
01:12:04,213 --> 01:12:06,010
Yes,and that too on a
stamp paper

705
01:12:20,396 --> 01:12:23,854
Vasu,now we'll meet up
after 365 days,till then...

706
01:12:29,906 --> 01:12:31,203
Our agreement has started...

707
01:14:12,008 --> 01:14:14,977
Vasu,why have you come back?

708
01:14:18,181 --> 01:14:19,148
No Vaus,no...

709
01:14:19,348 --> 01:14:20,815
Sapna,without seeing you...

710
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:29,324
Vasu,please go...

711
01:14:31,027 --> 01:14:34,155
Still not even a few hours have elapsed
that our agreement has started

712
01:14:34,697 --> 01:14:36,494
Why should we give people a chance
to point their fingers on us

713
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:40,002
That their love was so
feble,week

714
01:14:40,536 --> 01:14:42,504
Which couldn't even bear the
separation of few hours

715
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:45,666
And there are thousand's of
hours in a year

716
01:14:46,209 --> 01:14:50,669
Vasu,we should keep up our promise
we'll have to abide by the agreement

717
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:53,177
Vasu,go... please go...

718
01:14:55,718 --> 01:14:57,185
What's my fault,what's
my crime?

719
01:15:01,057 --> 01:15:02,354
I stayed away from you only for
a few hours

720
01:15:02,725 --> 01:15:05,523
But I couldn't stay,how am I
going to stay for a year?

721
01:15:05,728 --> 01:15:07,025
And why the hell
should I stay?

722
01:15:08,397 --> 01:15:10,365
In this city,people who know you
people who don't know you

723
01:15:10,566 --> 01:15:14,696
Animals,Birds,Trees,and more over...
the smallest of all the Ant can see you..

724
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,698
Only I can't see you...?

725
01:15:20,243 --> 01:15:22,711
If this is Justice,then it's also
justified to break this agreement

726
01:15:23,746 --> 01:15:25,043
Vasu,why don't you try
to understand?

727
01:15:25,248 --> 01:15:25,873
What should I understand?

728
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:30,215
Our agreement is not a matter
of court case

729
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,219
This has been given birth to
strengthen our Love and belief

730
01:15:35,591 --> 01:15:36,387
Vasu,do one thing

731
01:15:36,592 --> 01:15:37,217
What?

732
01:15:37,927 --> 01:15:40,555
You arrest me into your eyes
for a year

733
01:15:41,597 --> 01:15:42,894
But,don't come and meet me

734
01:15:44,267 --> 01:15:47,896
Think,that these 365 days
never came in our lives

735
01:15:49,105 --> 01:15:51,403
After that,you'll always
see me

736
01:15:52,275 --> 01:15:53,572
You'll keep seeing me
for life long

737
01:15:54,944 --> 01:15:57,913
Forgive me,if I've hurt
your feelings

738
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:00,408
But,Vasu,now you go...

739
01:16:01,784 --> 01:16:03,251
You can understand my
condition

740
01:16:03,953 --> 01:16:06,751
Even,I can't stay for a minute
away from you

741
01:16:07,623 --> 01:16:10,251
And today,when you've come
to meet me

742
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:12,423
I'm asking you to go

743
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:16,090
How much I would have felt
while saying this?

744
01:16:16,632 --> 01:16:17,758
How sorry and sad
I would have felt?

745
01:16:18,968 --> 01:16:21,596
But,we'll have to bear
this sorrow

746
01:16:22,305 --> 01:16:24,273
Vasu,we'll have to bear
go...

747
01:16:34,817 --> 01:16:35,784
Sapna,forgive me

748
01:16:53,336 --> 01:16:57,136
Sapna,forgive me,I lost my
senses out of enthusiasm

749
01:16:58,507 --> 01:17:03,809
Now,I promise to fulfill that
agreement for your Love

750
01:17:05,014 --> 01:17:06,311
Now,I'm leaving this city

751
01:17:08,517 --> 01:17:11,645
But Sapna,how can I stay
without remembering you?

752
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,824
That's why,I'll daily write
you a letter

753
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:17,651
But,I'll not post it

754
01:17:18,861 --> 01:17:22,319
And all those remembrances
of your's for these 365 days...

755
01:17:23,032 --> 01:17:28,993
I'll place all that on your feet
after 1 year

756
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:34,839
Now,I'm going,your Vasu

757
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:16,878
Okay,you know Hindi,Isn't it

758
01:18:17,253 --> 01:18:17,878
Little bit

759
01:18:18,087 --> 01:18:20,885
Hey,watch Hindi movies
you'll learn more

760
01:18:21,424 --> 01:18:22,049
Okay,where will you stay?

761
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:24,052
Actually,you can even
stay with me

762
01:18:24,427 --> 01:18:25,894
Because,I'm absolutely
all alone

763
01:18:26,095 --> 01:18:28,563
I'm a chornic Bachelor
since my birth

764
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:31,232
Neither wife... nor that...
nor a concubine

765
01:18:34,603 --> 01:18:36,730
Come... this is your room

766
01:18:37,273 --> 01:18:40,071
If you look out from this window
you can see Rama Krishna Theatre

767
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:41,910
Hey,there's a Telegu movie
playing in it

768
01:18:45,948 --> 01:18:47,074
Don't look through that window

769
01:18:47,283 --> 01:18:49,080
The opposite house's bathroom
is seen

770
01:18:49,618 --> 01:18:51,916
Okay,today you take rest,come
to the office from tomorrow

771
01:18:53,537 --> 01:18:56,166
And if you find time,roam around
Hyderabad, look at the city's charm

772
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:58,843
Look at the beauty
you'll enjoy

773
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:00,336
And if possible,go on a
blind date...

774
01:19:04,716 --> 01:19:07,514
In the evening,go for a movie
have you seen the film Pakizah?

775
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:08,344
No...

776
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,517
You haven't seen?Hey,what
are you upto?

777
01:19:10,722 --> 01:19:12,349
Hey,that's a poem

778
01:19:12,891 --> 01:19:13,516
Poem...?

779
01:19:18,563 --> 01:19:19,188
Brother, where are you lost?

780
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,548
Aunty... I've come...

781
01:19:44,923 --> 01:19:47,892
Aunty... where are you?

782
01:19:48,259 --> 01:19:49,726
Hey,Chakravarthy,come...

783
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:53,389
Where are your Lotus feet,they
are here,one minute...

784
01:19:53,765 --> 01:19:56,393
Let me cleanse this birth of
mine by touching your Lotus feet

785
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:57,727
And brighten the next birth
of mine

786
01:19:57,936 --> 01:19:58,903
God bless you...

787
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:02,068
How is everyone in Lucknow,your
mother,your father...?

788
01:20:02,273 --> 01:20:03,570
Hey,leave all those
oldies aside

789
01:20:04,108 --> 01:20:05,075
Where's Sapna baby?

790
01:20:05,276 --> 01:20:10,578
Hey,since morning,she's standing
on one leg and waiting for you

791
01:20:12,951 --> 01:20:13,576
Look, she's here...

792
01:20:14,786 --> 01:20:15,912
Sapna,look,who's come?

793
01:20:16,454 --> 01:20:17,580
Come Chakravarthy,come...

794
01:20:18,122 --> 01:20:20,920
Since morning, I've been waiting
only for you standing on one leg

795
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,586
Don't you have manners
of speaking?

796
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:35,428
Wow! I think you're a new Piegon
who has entered this hotel

797
01:20:37,809 --> 01:20:41,768
My name is Baby, I stay
downstairs

798
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:42,947
My name is Vasu
- What?

799
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:44,948
My name is Vasu

800
01:20:49,487 --> 01:20:51,284
Your moustache is really
wonderful

801
01:20:52,824 --> 01:20:53,950
Will you come for a movie
with me in the evening?

802
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,627
I don't understand Hindi
very well

803
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:59,789
Boss,who goes to a movie
to understand it?

804
01:21:00,164 --> 01:21:01,791
I think,I'm too fast
for you

805
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:04,464
I shouldn't have asked you
so early for a movie

806
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:08,464
I'll again ask you after
2 days

807
01:21:10,675 --> 01:21:13,303
Chakravarthy,you should show
your Manliness

808
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:17,477
Aunty,then you yourself suggest
what should I do?

809
01:21:19,517 --> 01:21:20,984
First,you stop sneezing

810
01:21:21,519 --> 01:21:24,488
After you have come,Sapna should
slowly forget Vasu

811
01:21:25,189 --> 01:21:27,987
And not only that,Vasu's name should
get erased from Sapna's heart

812
01:21:46,377 --> 01:21:47,002
How's it?

813
01:21:48,546 --> 01:21:50,013
Very good,my lord,very good

814
01:21:51,049 --> 01:21:54,018
But,what if we change it's
alignment a little,then?

815
01:21:55,887 --> 01:21:56,512
How?

816
01:22:03,227 --> 01:22:03,693
That's all

817
01:22:04,228 --> 01:22:06,856
It means,that's all madam
full stop

818
01:22:08,232 --> 01:22:12,191
Enough of match stick play,please
come to the movie

819
01:22:12,904 --> 01:22:14,531
Really,it'll be very
enjoyable

820
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,202
If it's not palatable
for madam

821
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:18,534
Then,madam can watch
the movie inside

822
01:22:19,077 --> 01:22:21,705
And your slave will watch
the posters outside...

823
01:22:21,913 --> 01:22:25,940
I'll wait for the lady

824
01:22:26,384 --> 01:22:28,375
No Chakran,I've lots to do

825
01:22:28,586 --> 01:22:29,553
What work do you have?

826
01:22:32,223 --> 01:22:33,087
This one

827
01:22:41,766 --> 01:22:43,131
Sir
- Yes!

828
01:22:43,334 --> 01:22:44,392
I've a small doubt

829
01:22:44,769 --> 01:22:45,565
About what?

830
01:22:46,237 --> 01:22:47,602
About an agreement

831
01:22:48,406 --> 01:22:49,873
There're 1 Lakh agreements
in the office-

832
01:22:50,074 --> 01:22:51,006
Which one are you referring to?

833
01:22:51,509 --> 01:22:52,737
Love agreement,sir

834
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:56,640
It's most important

835
01:22:56,848 --> 01:22:59,373
Wonderful,I haven't seen such an
agreement in a movie also

836
01:22:59,584 --> 01:23:02,781
I can't meet Sapna,I can't even
write a letter to her

837
01:23:03,554 --> 01:23:06,421
If,I send her an
empty envelope

838
01:23:06,691 --> 01:23:07,851
Then,what can happen?

839
01:23:13,331 --> 01:23:14,992
Your love is very sincere

840
01:23:17,235 --> 01:23:18,725
Love makes the world beautiful

841
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:43,026
Hey,what's all this?

842
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:47,130
You had rubbed off
only one name

843
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:49,866
See how many more have
appeared

844
01:23:50,535 --> 01:23:51,832
What to do now,mother

845
01:23:52,937 --> 01:23:54,165
Darling!

846
01:23:54,372 --> 01:23:55,270
Daddy has seen

847
01:23:57,442 --> 01:23:58,204
Shameless!

848
01:23:58,776 --> 01:24:01,142
My forehead is blank,write
on that too

849
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:09,447
Dear sir

850
01:24:10,354 --> 01:24:11,150
I drink

851
01:24:12,023 --> 01:24:14,514
You all know & the entire
Town knows

852
01:24:15,259 --> 01:24:17,659
But,I've a unique way
of drinking

853
01:24:18,529 --> 01:24:20,861
Before 9 'o' clock I drink
as much as I can

854
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,566
But exactly at 9 'o' clock
my party gets over

855
01:24:24,202 --> 01:24:28,502
It's neither at 8.59
nor at 8.61

856
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,140
9 'o' clock means exactly
9 'o' clock

857
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:34,108
I don't compromise on
this matter

858
01:24:34,512 --> 01:24:36,639
This fact,you & the entire
city knows

859
01:24:40,651 --> 01:24:43,916
Hey,Samba.. Oh Samba brother
- What is this?

860
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:46,954
Till now neither the glasses nor
the heads have broken

861
01:24:47,425 --> 01:24:49,325
Why has the party not
bloomed till now?

862
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:08,469
He is simple and an
innocent boy

863
01:25:10,982 --> 01:25:13,610
Oh! meet Mr. Ram Singh
he also stays in Goa

864
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:14,713
I see!

865
01:25:15,019 --> 01:25:16,043
Where do you stay in Goa?

866
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,811
Panaji,near palm beach
light house

867
01:25:19,123 --> 01:25:21,956
So cheers to our simpleton
friend

868
01:25:46,951 --> 01:25:48,248
Have you come for the party?

869
01:25:48,753 --> 01:25:51,221
No,I've escaped from
the party

870
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:55,756
Have you also escaped from
the party?

871
01:25:58,763 --> 01:26:00,492
Mr. Danny is my elder brother

872
01:26:02,733 --> 01:26:04,200
In Mr. Hari's company,I'm...

873
01:26:06,904 --> 01:26:09,236
I'm the new employee
in his company

874
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:13,602
My name is Vasu

875
01:26:15,913 --> 01:26:16,675
Please sit down

876
01:26:23,754 --> 01:26:24,812
My name is Vasu

877
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:35,092
Why are you telling your name
again and again?

878
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,691
So that you tell me
your name

879
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:42,531
My name is Sandhya

880
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:45,141
Your name is very 'ACHHI' (Nice)

881
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:49,746
Achhi (Nice) not Achhi
but Achha (Nice)

882
01:26:50,281 --> 01:26:52,044
Nice! Nice!

883
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:55,741
I don't know Hindi properly,that's why
I make grammatical mistakes

884
01:26:57,288 --> 01:26:58,585
Where do you come from?

885
01:26:58,789 --> 01:27:00,882
I'm a Tamilian and Tamil is
my Mother tongue

886
01:27:03,294 --> 01:27:04,192
Okay,tell me...

887
01:27:04,395 --> 01:27:06,295
Why the swimming pool is
like this?"TANNl EllAME"

888
01:27:11,869 --> 01:27:14,064
Some people have similar
lives

889
01:27:14,805 --> 01:27:17,399
Like this pool... empty

890
01:27:18,509 --> 01:27:22,445
I know only two words of Tamil
Greeting and Food

891
01:27:25,016 --> 01:27:27,712
I was in Madras for a week
with my husband

892
01:27:27,985 --> 01:27:30,146
Oh! are you married?

893
01:27:31,155 --> 01:27:31,644
Yes

894
01:27:32,423 --> 01:27:35,358
It was performed & it
has also ended

895
01:27:36,494 --> 01:27:37,119
In air...

896
01:27:38,896 --> 01:27:43,697
My husband died in an
air crash

897
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:53,476
When a person starts life...

898
01:27:54,178 --> 01:27:55,145
He forgets

899
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:57,576
That death is not very far

900
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,177
Whenever the lotuses of
happiness bloom

901
01:28:00,518 --> 01:28:03,112
Usually they bloom in the
lake of tears

902
01:28:03,754 --> 01:28:05,016
These are God's divine
plays

903
01:28:05,956 --> 01:28:10,416
God gives smiles and also tears

904
01:28:12,463 --> 01:28:14,158
Your Hindi is very sweet

905
01:28:14,965 --> 01:28:16,364
Hindi is really sweet

906
01:28:19,804 --> 01:28:20,361
Sweet...

907
01:28:21,706 --> 01:28:22,900
Will you teach me Hindi?

908
01:28:26,143 --> 01:28:27,405
Oh! so many names

909
01:28:27,978 --> 01:28:29,912
How many will they be?

910
01:28:31,382 --> 01:28:35,045
May be in thousands! because
Vasu is one among thousands

911
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:38,647
Madam,Vasu is one among thousands
I agree

912
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:44,384
But among these thousands you can
accord second place to me!Isn't it

913
01:28:44,929 --> 01:28:45,588
Meaning?

914
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:46,820
I request you!

915
01:28:47,131 --> 01:28:50,498
Look there! I've written my
name just once

916
01:28:50,968 --> 01:28:52,993
With so much of love Chakram

917
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:58,197
Please don't erase that or else
all my desires will be erased

918
01:28:59,477 --> 01:29:01,604
After one year,If Vasu doesn't
come,then...

919
01:29:01,812 --> 01:29:03,074
No,no just in case

920
01:29:03,814 --> 01:29:07,011
Then,atleast you can give some
thought to my name

921
01:29:18,262 --> 01:29:19,559
Forgive me Sapna

922
01:29:20,331 --> 01:29:22,299
I lost my balance in my
over enthusiasm

923
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,833
Now I promise

924
01:29:25,369 --> 01:29:26,427
For your love

925
01:29:26,971 --> 01:29:29,030
I'll definitely culminate
that agreement

926
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:34,742
I'm leaving this city
but Sapna..

927
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:56,828
Are you real mother or
step mother?

928
01:29:57,635 --> 01:29:59,728
Step mother will not worry
about your welfare

929
01:30:00,337 --> 01:30:04,273
I'm your real mother,I can even
kill you for your welfare

930
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:06,843
If your madness continues
like this...

931
01:30:07,211 --> 01:30:09,179
Then,I'll kill you with my
own hands,got it

932
01:30:09,547 --> 01:30:12,675
You can kill me but you can't
erase my memories

933
01:30:13,551 --> 01:30:14,677
They are not in your
hands

934
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:19,353
Where are you going?

935
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,688
Why? Will you also come
with me?

936
01:30:24,562 --> 01:30:27,861
Where ever my heart
& memories will go

937
01:30:28,899 --> 01:30:31,527
Can you go every where
come

938
01:30:38,576 --> 01:30:53,048
Let the ocean & all the
rivers try

939
01:30:53,424 --> 01:30:59,385
Love can't be subdued

940
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:07,063
Every spark gets extinguished

941
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:14,900
Vasu,what happened.. please
tell me,what happened?

942
01:31:35,633 --> 01:31:39,592
You naughty,rascal...

943
01:31:40,638 --> 01:31:44,768
Hey,where are you running away?
- Do sit ups

944
01:32:16,507 --> 01:32:31,821
Salutations to the
sweet sixteen

945
01:32:32,022 --> 01:32:37,824
Salutations to the first sight
of love

946
01:32:38,195 --> 01:32:45,328
Salutations to the first sight
of love,salutations

947
01:32:47,871 --> 01:32:58,679
The first one in the world who
kindled love in this heart

948
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:10,518
Salutations to first sweet heart
of the world

949
01:33:11,395 --> 01:33:17,698
Thanks to the paths shown
by love

950
01:33:17,901 --> 01:33:23,362
Salutations to the path which
reaches the heart

951
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:15,581
The place where this maiden got
calumniated

952
01:34:21,632 --> 01:34:27,434
Salutations to that Town,that Street
& that House

953
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:33,432
The one who united us &
separated us

954
01:34:33,644 --> 01:34:39,276
Salutations to that Time,to that Moment
& to that Chime

955
01:35:14,685 --> 01:35:20,317
We were meeting here
it is written here

956
01:35:20,524 --> 01:35:26,156
Salutations to this Writings &
it's Punctuations

957
01:35:27,865 --> 01:35:33,326
On the sands of shore,where the
heart quavered like this

958
01:35:33,704 --> 01:35:39,165
Salutations to every Wave which
swelled in the sea

959
01:35:41,044 --> 01:35:46,676
In the depths of the enchanting
lake of the eyes

960
01:35:46,884 --> 01:35:52,345
Salutations to that Whirlpool
which drowned us

961
01:35:52,723 --> 01:35:58,855
Defying the veil,the thing
that slipped away

962
01:35:59,062 --> 01:36:04,694
Salutations to that Green wicked
upper cloth

963
01:36:05,068 --> 01:36:16,036
The enemies of love tried
their best

964
01:36:16,413 --> 01:36:21,874
Salutations to the Look which
wasn't deterred

965
01:37:14,471 --> 01:37:16,939
When 2 of us meet

966
01:37:17,808 --> 01:37:18,274
Both

967
01:37:18,976 --> 01:37:21,103
When both of us will meet

968
01:37:21,478 --> 01:37:22,775
Both
- Yes both

969
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:25,606
When both of us will meet

970
01:37:25,816 --> 01:37:26,612
Yes,then

971
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:29,778
We'll make a new history

972
01:37:30,153 --> 01:37:31,950
M- A-K-E

973
01:37:32,656 --> 01:37:33,782
Create will be better
Isn't it?

974
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:36,785
Not only better,but
beautiful

975
01:37:38,829 --> 01:37:40,956
C- R-E-A-T-E

976
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,293
And,if we don't meet,then...?

977
01:37:47,004 --> 01:37:49,472
And,if we are not able to
meet,then...?

978
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:50,966
No... no...

979
01:37:51,508 --> 01:37:54,966
And,if we are not able to meet,then
.. yeah-Yes

980
01:37:55,178 --> 01:37:57,976
If we are not able to meet,then
- Yes,further

981
01:37:59,016 --> 01:38:01,985
Even then,we'll create a
new history

982
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:07,320
Wonderful! Even then we'll
create a new history

983
01:38:14,531 --> 01:38:14,997
Listen Postman

984
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:17,826
The letter which you gave that
house,where did it come from?

985
01:38:18,035 --> 01:38:19,332
I don't know
- Is it from Hyderabad?

986
01:38:19,536 --> 01:38:20,662
I told you,I don't know

987
01:38:22,706 --> 01:38:24,333
What kind of a Postman is he?
he does not know anything

988
01:38:32,549 --> 01:38:35,177
Daughter,in the morning,you
were asking the Postman -

989
01:38:35,886 --> 01:38:38,184
Yes,this is Vasu's letter only!
he is alright

990
01:38:38,555 --> 01:38:40,182
Job is also good,and
in Hyderabad...

991
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,856
Enough... Enough...

992
01:38:41,058 --> 01:38:43,686
It's in Hindi,see
- I don't want to see anything

993
01:38:43,894 --> 01:38:46,362
I know that you'll only
talk about Vasu-

994
01:38:46,563 --> 01:38:49,361
And put the blame on me
I've broken the agreement

995
01:38:50,067 --> 01:38:52,865
I beg of you! I don't want to
know about Vasu

996
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:56,870
Nor about Hyderabad
nor about his job

997
01:38:57,407 --> 01:38:59,875
For God sake,in future
don't meet me

998
01:39:00,077 --> 01:39:02,875
Don't see me & don't
talk to me also

999
01:39:08,251 --> 01:39:10,219
Hello,Mr. Hari,are you fine?

1000
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:13,048
Come.. come the devotee of
Lord Hanuman!

1001
01:39:14,091 --> 01:39:14,887
How are you?

1002
01:39:15,258 --> 01:39:16,384
Nothing new about me!

1003
01:39:25,602 --> 01:39:27,729
Neither wife nor that and
nor concubine

1004
01:39:29,773 --> 01:39:30,899
How is my son?

1005
01:39:31,942 --> 01:39:32,909
How is Sapna?

1006
01:39:35,612 --> 01:39:38,240
Did you see Mr. Hari,he's
asking straight away

1007
01:39:38,448 --> 01:39:39,244
How is Sapna?

1008
01:39:39,783 --> 01:39:41,250
He didn't even ask
how is mother?

1009
01:39:42,452 --> 01:39:44,920
Okay,how is mother?
- Enough!

1010
01:39:45,288 --> 01:39:46,585
Now tell me,how is Sapna?

1011
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,916
She is like a Pumpkin

1012
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:49,755
Mr. Hari,did you see his
mentality?

1013
01:39:51,128 --> 01:39:53,926
I don't want anything
but I wish that-

1014
01:39:54,131 --> 01:39:56,929
He should forget Sapna completely

1015
01:39:57,634 --> 01:39:59,761
One girl is staying in
this city

1016
01:40:00,137 --> 01:40:01,263
She's from our Madras

1017
01:40:01,638 --> 01:40:04,436
Caste and Race
matches perfectly

1018
01:40:04,641 --> 01:40:08,941
I want that some how Vasu should
get married to her

1019
01:40:09,813 --> 01:40:12,782
Mr. Shivaram,caste and Race
are now outdated

1020
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:14,276
This is modern time

1021
01:40:14,985 --> 01:40:17,283
First love and later on
marriage

1022
01:40:17,487 --> 01:40:17,782
But...

1023
01:40:18,655 --> 01:40:20,282
We'll play a game
- What?

1024
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:22,458
In this Love story,we'll
change the girl

1025
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:23,785
How come?...

1026
01:40:24,161 --> 01:40:27,460
I'll appoint that girl as a typist
in my office

1027
01:40:27,998 --> 01:40:28,965
Then? -Then what?

1028
01:40:29,332 --> 01:40:34,292
Their eyes will meet and
they'll fall in love

1029
01:40:34,671 --> 01:40:36,639
Then...?- Love marriage

1030
01:40:37,507 --> 01:40:40,476
Then?... but how is it possible?

1031
01:40:40,677 --> 01:40:41,803
What is the guarantee?

1032
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:44,647
What guarantee? I've seen
many such cases...

1033
01:40:44,848 --> 01:40:45,974
It's a small matter

1034
01:40:46,183 --> 01:40:47,650
Is it a small matter?- Yes

1035
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:49,648
What's the name of the girl?

1036
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:50,986
Tulasi

1037
01:40:51,354 --> 01:40:54,482
What's your age?-
Equal to Actress Hellen?

1038
01:40:56,026 --> 01:40:58,824
Zeenataman?.. Teenamuneem?

1039
01:40:59,696 --> 01:41:00,663
Who are they?

1040
01:41:00,864 --> 01:41:03,492
Oh! My god!don't you
watch Hindi movies?

1041
01:41:03,867 --> 01:41:05,994
I watch only Tamil films

1042
01:41:06,203 --> 01:41:07,170
Only Tamil movies?

1043
01:41:10,540 --> 01:41:12,337
Have you seen a Tamil movie
"Kadhalika Neramilai"

1044
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:13,835
So,you've seen

1045
01:41:16,379 --> 01:41:17,846
What's the meaning of
that title?

1046
01:41:18,381 --> 01:41:19,848
There is no time to love

1047
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,677
Here,you'll get lot of time!

1048
01:41:42,739 --> 01:41:45,037
Oh! No.. Aunty,what are
you burning?

1049
01:41:56,253 --> 01:42:00,553
Come.. come,your father laid a bet
that this photo can't be burnt

1050
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:02,058
I'm proving that it can
be burnt

1051
01:42:02,592 --> 01:42:05,220
But,Mr. Professor,when did you
indulge in the dirty bet

1052
01:42:05,428 --> 01:42:06,224
Stop blabbering!

1053
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:25,737
Atlast,I've won the bet

1054
01:42:30,453 --> 01:42:31,420
Sir,your Tea

1055
01:43:20,337 --> 01:43:21,133
Now,who has won?

1056
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:35,648
Oh! you are here?

1057
01:43:38,521 --> 01:43:40,148
Swimming Pool which is filled
with water-

1058
01:43:40,357 --> 01:43:42,825
Is pleasant to look at
Isn't it?- Yes

1059
01:43:44,194 --> 01:43:45,661
I wanted to ask you
Something

1060
01:43:46,696 --> 01:43:48,163
Do you know,how to dance?

1061
01:43:49,032 --> 01:43:51,000
Before,I used to dance
but not now

1062
01:43:51,201 --> 01:43:51,496
Why?

1063
01:43:54,704 --> 01:43:56,171
Everything has got over
with him

1064
01:43:56,706 --> 01:43:57,832
But,why did you ask?

1065
01:43:58,041 --> 01:44:00,509
I thought you can teach
me dance-Yes?

1066
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:02,678
Why?Am I not fit for it?

1067
01:44:03,046 --> 01:44:04,013
Yes! why not?

1068
01:44:04,547 --> 01:44:06,515
But,why do you want to
learn this?

1069
01:44:06,716 --> 01:44:09,514
I want to tire myself so much
by this practice

1070
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:11,186
So,that the storm inside me
may mitigate

1071
01:44:12,055 --> 01:44:14,853
Oh! you want to meditate
- No,I want to forget

1072
01:44:15,725 --> 01:44:16,350
Will you teach me?

1073
01:44:16,559 --> 01:44:19,027
Why not?but it will be
very experience

1074
01:44:20,730 --> 01:44:23,198
Fees for Teacher
- We'll talk about it later

1075
01:44:23,566 --> 01:44:24,533
Then,what now?

1076
01:44:24,901 --> 01:44:29,031
First,you've to touch
Teacher's feet

1077
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:31,365
Bless me!

1078
01:45:28,331 --> 01:45:33,428
When we both come together

1079
01:45:33,803 --> 01:45:43,769
When we both come together
we'll create a new History

1080
01:45:44,147 --> 01:45:48,777
Even,if we both don't
come together

1081
01:45:49,319 --> 01:45:59,456
Even,if we both don't come together
we'll create a new history,even then

1082
01:46:17,514 --> 01:46:23,146
How many people had loved
in this world?

1083
01:46:25,021 --> 01:46:31,324
Don't know how many,lover's blood
had this world sucked?

1084
01:46:32,028 --> 01:46:37,330
Why doesn't the thirsty sword stop?
why doesn't it's thirst gets subside?

1085
01:46:37,534 --> 01:46:41,493
We'll subside this world's
thirst!

1086
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:52,511
We'll create a New History!

1087
01:47:26,082 --> 01:47:35,389
My heart is agitated
all night!

1088
01:47:36,593 --> 01:47:45,058
When the heartless world
tells us...

1089
01:47:45,602 --> 01:47:50,403
How many names are there in the books
who had been restricted to meet?

1090
01:47:50,607 --> 01:47:55,408
Why should we enter our names
in that list?

1091
01:48:00,617 --> 01:48:05,247
We'll create a new History!

1092
01:49:19,028 --> 01:49:20,655
Cholera in Hyderabad!

1093
01:49:35,545 --> 01:49:37,672
Let him die with cholera
and die a Dog's death

1094
01:49:43,553 --> 01:49:45,521
"Are you fine"?

1095
01:49:50,059 --> 01:49:53,358
Whenever you meet me,you'll always
ask me,"Are you fine"?

1096
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:55,026
What does it mean?

1097
01:49:55,999 --> 01:49:58,365
Means... are you fine?

1098
01:50:17,086 --> 01:50:18,053
Her highness!

1099
01:50:19,756 --> 01:50:21,053
Why're you sitting alone here?

1100
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:24,217
Sir,will you do a favour
to me?

1101
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:25,051
Order me!

1102
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:27,895
I've written Vasu's name all over
my room's wall,Isn't it?

1103
01:50:28,097 --> 01:50:28,392
Yes... Yes!

1104
01:50:28,598 --> 01:50:30,896
Can you count them and tell me
how many Vasu's are there?

1105
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:32,067
Immediately!

1106
01:50:39,442 --> 01:50:41,569
I'm fine!

1107
01:50:44,447 --> 01:50:46,574
I'm fine!

1108
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:56,422
72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80...
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86...

1109
01:51:01,664 --> 01:51:02,255
Where did I leave it?

1110
01:51:07,637 --> 01:51:08,763
Surprise,Seethuram

1111
01:51:09,072 --> 01:51:10,767
When ever I want to send you
on an inspection

1112
01:51:11,007 --> 01:51:12,440
It'll always be invariably your
mother's death Anniversary

1113
01:51:12,642 --> 01:51:14,439
I want to ask you,how many
mother's do you've?

1114
01:51:15,812 --> 01:51:18,440
Why have you become a deaf like
Sanjeev Kumar of film'Koshish'?

1115
01:51:18,648 --> 01:51:19,114
Come on tell!

1116
01:51:19,649 --> 01:51:21,947
Last time it wasn't my mother's,it was
my grandma's Death Anniversary

1117
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:24,119
Grandma's Death Anniversary?

1118
01:51:25,088 --> 01:51:28,785
Whose will it be next time?
your's?... Mine?... Whose?

1119
01:51:29,025 --> 01:51:29,957
Come on tell

1120
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:33,958
I had arranged everything for
your Mangalore trip

1121
01:51:34,163 --> 01:51:36,131
Whom shall I send at
this last minute?

1122
01:51:37,667 --> 01:51:39,134
Did you see the film?

1123
01:51:39,669 --> 01:51:42,297
Sir,if you permit,shall
I go?

1124
01:51:42,572 --> 01:51:44,130
What do you know about
this work?

1125
01:51:44,507 --> 01:51:45,474
I'll leave,Sir!

1126
01:51:45,708 --> 01:51:48,302
Alright! do you want to
help Seethuram?

1127
01:51:48,678 --> 01:51:51,977
No sir,it'll be a great help
for myself

1128
01:51:52,348 --> 01:51:54,316
Someone has to go there
you can go!

1129
01:52:40,563 --> 01:52:42,190
Who's car is that one
with stickers?

1130
01:52:44,167 --> 01:52:46,362
Oh! that Hazel,H belongs
to Chakravarthi

1131
01:52:46,769 --> 01:52:49,863
He has come from Goa,he had
enquired about students group

1132
01:52:50,072 --> 01:52:50,868
.. And took up a room in
this Hotel only

1133
01:53:20,102 --> 01:53:21,228
Have you come here to
spy on me?

1134
01:53:21,771 --> 01:53:25,571
You don't get angry my highness
it was Aunty's order to watch over you

1135
01:53:25,808 --> 01:53:27,400
She doesn't have any faith
on you,Isn't it?

1136
01:53:27,677 --> 01:53:30,237
When she doesn't have faith on me
why didn't she stop me there itself?

1137
01:53:30,446 --> 01:53:33,415
Does she consider,am I so shameless
to elope with anyone at midnight?

1138
01:53:33,616 --> 01:53:35,413
No.. No..! No.. No!

1139
01:53:36,619 --> 01:53:39,247
I've not come alone,I've come with
100 fellow students!

1140
01:53:39,455 --> 01:53:41,753
So many girl students,Teachers
have come with me

1141
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:44,422
What'll they think about me,if
they see you spying me?

1142
01:53:44,627 --> 01:53:49,758
You don't worry,my highness! neither
I'll chase you nor I'll watch you

1143
01:53:50,166 --> 01:53:52,259
It was aunty's order
that I had to...

1144
01:53:53,302 --> 01:53:54,269
After all,she's my
mother-in-law

1145
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:55,095
Mother-in-law?

1146
01:53:55,638 --> 01:53:56,605
If the agreement breaks down...

1147
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,298
If her highness permits me
shall I go for a bath?

1148
01:55:07,243 --> 01:55:27,393
What is this strange,bond that
we share between us?

1149
01:55:28,064 --> 01:55:34,367
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

1150
01:56:26,288 --> 01:56:39,099
One string pulls and the second
comes running!

1151
01:56:39,802 --> 01:56:45,934
It'll come tied by the pull
of brittle strings

1152
01:56:46,642 --> 01:56:56,608
Like... like a mad lover!

1153
01:57:03,492 --> 01:57:09,795
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

1154
01:57:54,710 --> 01:58:01,013
Neither I'm getting sleep
nor peace

1155
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:14,351
Even after a Herculian effort
I'm unable to stop it

1156
01:58:14,964 --> 01:58:24,862
...You are coming into
my dreams

1157
01:58:31,747 --> 01:58:37,708
It's neither known to me
nor known to you

1158
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:11,185
Where did she go away?

1159
01:59:23,832 --> 01:59:25,561
Are you a Tourist guide?

1160
01:59:26,535 --> 01:59:27,263
Where's Sapna?

1161
01:59:27,670 --> 01:59:29,194
She has gone out

1162
01:59:30,973 --> 01:59:31,701
Who are you?

1163
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:34,204
Me?... I'm her husband

1164
01:59:35,344 --> 01:59:35,969
Husband?

1165
01:59:36,512 --> 01:59:37,376
Almost!

1166
01:59:38,881 --> 01:59:39,779
I mean would-be husband

1167
01:59:41,784 --> 01:59:44,651
I thought,before I get married,I
shall get trained in family life

1168
02:00:08,377 --> 02:00:10,470
Sapna has gone with her would-be
husband in car

1169
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:12,977
Both would enjoy their
journey back

1170
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:17,344
Let them enjoy,both are going
to be husband & wife

1171
02:00:17,553 --> 02:00:19,350
Let them do anything,how're
we concerned with it?

1172
02:00:19,755 --> 02:00:20,744
Who are you?

1173
02:00:53,889 --> 02:00:55,379
When did you come back
from Mangalore?

1174
02:00:58,394 --> 02:00:59,383
What happened to you?

1175
02:01:01,563 --> 02:01:02,495
...Say something

1176
02:01:05,501 --> 02:01:06,399
...Let it play on

1177
02:02:46,235 --> 02:02:47,964
You're dancing like a
typhoon?

1178
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:49,228
What happened to you?

1179
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:55,373
I don't want to get drowned in
tears,that's why!

1180
02:02:56,545 --> 02:02:58,775
I was in such a deep
trance of sleep

1181
02:02:59,281 --> 02:03:02,148
...That even,if my eye was pierced
by thorn,I wouldn't have realised it

1182
02:03:03,852 --> 02:03:06,582
But now,I've come out of
the trance

1183
02:03:07,122 --> 02:03:11,149
And the truth has come infront of me
in it's true disposing form

1184
02:03:12,594 --> 02:03:15,290
You always tried to hide
a pain from me

1185
02:03:15,531 --> 02:03:20,298
Even when it tried to come out
you always stopped it in throat

1186
02:03:21,436 --> 02:03:24,894
Can't you share your pain
with me?

1187
02:03:26,809 --> 02:03:28,777
This is not pain..
it's poison

1188
02:03:29,077 --> 02:03:32,444
Neither can I swallow it
nor spit it out

1189
02:03:33,282 --> 02:03:37,218
In front,till my vision sees
I find only sea of darkness

1190
02:03:37,419 --> 02:03:38,818
Sandhya,I feel,I may get
drowned in it

1191
02:03:44,259 --> 02:03:45,954
I need a companion

1192
02:03:53,702 --> 02:03:55,636
I never saw you in such
a condition

1193
02:03:56,438 --> 02:03:59,635
Your eyes are burning like
Embers

1194
02:04:00,075 --> 02:04:03,602
Not just eyes,my entire body
is burning

1195
02:04:03,812 --> 02:04:05,746
My soul is also burning

1196
02:04:06,915 --> 02:04:11,648
I need such a cool shadow... under which
I can forget all my memories

1197
02:04:12,254 --> 02:04:13,778
All my memories

1198
02:04:14,256 --> 02:04:16,884
Why can't you be that
shadow?

1199
02:04:39,815 --> 02:04:42,249
I'm Siramakrishnan speaking
how are you?

1200
02:04:42,818 --> 02:04:44,251
Is my son there?

1201
02:04:44,453 --> 02:04:49,481
No,it's 6 P.M now,everyone has left
the office,I'm alone in the office

1202
02:04:49,858 --> 02:04:51,621
I've some personal work

1203
02:04:52,561 --> 02:04:55,962
How's Thulasi,have they started
meeting or not?

1204
02:04:56,164 --> 02:05:01,397
You're talking about meeting,she
has stuck,such that

1205
02:05:01,603 --> 02:05:04,902
If sensor people see it,they'll
cut them for obscene

1206
02:05:07,142 --> 02:05:09,872
Very good.. very good
how are you?

1207
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:14,276
What could be sensational for me?neither
wife nor concubine or any woman

1208
02:05:26,461 --> 02:05:27,792
Do you love him?

1209
02:05:35,103 --> 02:05:37,537
Do you want to marry him?

1210
02:05:39,508 --> 02:05:40,998
Come on tell

1211
02:05:41,576 --> 02:05:45,034
If you permit me
by saying Yes to it

1212
02:05:47,883 --> 02:05:52,616
How eagerly I was waiting
to hear this Yes from you?

1213
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:58,058
If you settle again in life
with this marriage

1214
02:05:58,961 --> 02:06:02,397
There Isn't any happiness which
is bigger than this for me

1215
02:06:15,010 --> 02:06:20,414
Sandhya,come whatever may,your
marriage will take place

1216
02:06:21,516 --> 02:06:22,540
...Definitely it'll...

1217
02:06:39,935 --> 02:06:42,199
You?... In Hyderabad?

1218
02:06:43,538 --> 02:06:45,733
I've a book stall in this
Exhibition

1219
02:06:46,408 --> 02:06:48,569
Do you want to know
who is she?

1220
02:06:49,311 --> 02:06:50,869
She's my future wife

1221
02:06:51,947 --> 02:06:55,144
Go and tell in Goa,that
I too can marry

1222
02:07:03,392 --> 02:07:05,019
Time?... Yes

1223
02:07:06,595 --> 02:07:07,823
I met him in Hyderabad

1224
02:07:08,296 --> 02:07:10,594
And he introduced me to his
future wife also

1225
02:07:10,799 --> 02:07:11,766
She's from Hyderabad

1226
02:07:12,667 --> 02:07:17,468
What a great beauty?!what a
youthfulness? what an eyes?

1227
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:22,336
What great style,what great lips
what great colours?

1228
02:07:39,027 --> 02:07:41,461
Oh! Sapna! Is it you?...
come.. come..

1229
02:07:43,331 --> 02:07:44,389
How are you,my child?

1230
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,197
I've come to ask you about
an important matter?

1231
02:07:48,103 --> 02:07:50,435
First time,you've come to our house
just wait for a minute

1232
02:07:57,546 --> 02:07:59,514
Child,have this sweet

1233
02:08:00,482 --> 02:08:02,541
Is it for Vasu's
Engagement?

1234
02:08:02,751 --> 02:08:03,410
What did you say?

1235
02:08:03,618 --> 02:08:05,449
Vasu is marrying some one else
Isn't it?

1236
02:08:05,654 --> 02:08:06,382
Who said that?

1237
02:08:06,621 --> 02:08:07,383
Come on tell

1238
02:08:07,722 --> 02:08:08,950
Is it true or not?

1239
02:08:09,291 --> 02:08:10,451
This can't be true

1240
02:08:10,659 --> 02:08:13,025
Without intimating us,how
can Vasu marry?

1241
02:08:13,395 --> 02:08:14,760
Then what I had heard
just now?

1242
02:08:15,030 --> 02:08:15,860
It's a lie

1243
02:08:16,064 --> 02:08:18,589
That's not a lie! you're lying

1244
02:08:18,967 --> 02:08:20,434
...For your son's love

1245
02:08:20,569 --> 02:08:22,833
You've gone mad in love

1246
02:08:23,038 --> 02:08:25,598
Did you understand my son
only this much?

1247
02:08:25,974 --> 02:08:28,306
Vasu will renege his promise

1248
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:34,573
No.. no.. I've known Vasu since his
birth,are you teaching me about him?

1249
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:36,950
Yuck! go away,you mad girl

1250
02:08:45,727 --> 02:08:48,787
You seem to be a man of
great conduct

1251
02:08:49,397 --> 02:08:53,925
I didn't know that you too have the
habit of keeping false promises

1252
02:08:54,469 --> 02:08:59,463
An experienced woman could
manage very well

1253
02:08:59,908 --> 02:09:02,809
Are you marrying that widow
with these ideas?

1254
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:12,042
I don't know,what do you men
see in a woman?

1255
02:09:12,287 --> 02:09:14,346
That you're ready to die
immediately

1256
02:09:14,556 --> 02:09:17,548
Is there any custom & tradition
for it or not?

1257
02:09:17,759 --> 02:09:22,560
A big house... large eyes.. If one has
large front & back enough

1258
02:09:22,764 --> 02:09:23,662
...Is it enough?

1259
02:09:24,366 --> 02:09:27,597
But,Baby! I've not seen anything
big in you

1260
02:09:27,936 --> 02:09:29,528
Except,your big dirty mouth

1261
02:09:39,414 --> 02:09:41,678
Did Vasu give you an
invitation or not?

1262
02:09:44,786 --> 02:09:48,779
Unable to understand... what's that
big in you?

1263
02:09:49,024 --> 02:09:50,753
Which Vasu likes in you!

1264
02:09:51,993 --> 02:09:53,858
Except that big vermillion

1265
02:11:19,714 --> 02:11:21,648
You're Sapna,Isn't it?
- Yes and you

1266
02:11:21,850 --> 02:11:22,874
I've something to discuss
with you

1267
02:11:23,084 --> 02:11:25,678
It's time for my college
mother is inside,you may meet her

1268
02:11:26,988 --> 02:11:29,718
My name is Sandhya!- Is it
- I've come from Hyderabad

1269
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:31,649
I'm Vaus's friend

1270
02:11:39,701 --> 02:11:40,531
Come in

1271
02:11:40,902 --> 02:11:41,834
What about your college?

1272
02:11:42,971 --> 02:11:44,438
Today,it's leave

1273
02:11:52,881 --> 02:11:56,612
Come Vasu,do something helpful
for your marriage arrangements?

1274
02:11:57,018 --> 02:11:58,144
Write atleast addresses
on these cards?

1275
02:11:59,888 --> 02:12:00,752
Isn't Sandhya there?

1276
02:12:00,955 --> 02:12:01,717
She has gone out of station

1277
02:12:02,457 --> 02:12:04,618
To personally invite her friends
for the marriage

1278
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:08,029
Can't they be invited by post?

1279
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:09,526
It's a normal practice now!

1280
02:12:11,399 --> 02:12:12,024
Come in!

1281
02:12:28,917 --> 02:12:29,542
Please sit down!

1282
02:12:33,755 --> 02:12:36,553
Who wrote all this?

1283
02:12:36,925 --> 02:12:37,550
It's me!

1284
02:12:38,426 --> 02:12:41,554
It was mother's order not to
utter even Vasu's name

1285
02:12:42,931 --> 02:12:44,057
For that order...

1286
02:12:44,933 --> 02:12:46,059
...This was my reply!

1287
02:12:47,435 --> 02:12:50,734
Mother is the biggest hurdle
in our love

1288
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:51,734
Yes!

1289
02:12:53,441 --> 02:12:54,908
Vasu told me everything

1290
02:12:56,778 --> 02:13:01,909
Did Vasu tell you everything?

1291
02:13:02,283 --> 02:13:04,751
If he hadn't told me
how could I know all this?

1292
02:13:05,453 --> 02:13:08,911
Whenever we meet,it's always
about you,we discuss

1293
02:13:15,630 --> 02:13:18,599
Are you both so close?

1294
02:13:18,967 --> 02:13:19,262
Yes!

1295
02:13:23,471 --> 02:13:26,440
So,close... that you both touch
each other also?

1296
02:13:27,976 --> 02:13:30,274
Whenever we meet
we shake hands!

1297
02:13:41,156 --> 02:13:42,453
How is my Vasu?

1298
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:46,127
This is 30th time,you're
asking this!

1299
02:13:46,494 --> 02:13:49,952
Don't count!I'll ask
millions of times

1300
02:13:50,832 --> 02:13:51,958
How's Vasu?

1301
02:13:53,501 --> 02:13:57,460
Our agreement will not break,Isn't it
If I ask like that?

1302
02:14:10,518 --> 02:14:13,817
Poor man!he Isn't a bad man
but he's a simpleton

1303
02:14:14,022 --> 02:14:17,822
He has come from Lucknow with a
fond hope that I'll marry him

1304
02:14:18,193 --> 02:14:19,660
If the agreement fails

1305
02:14:20,528 --> 02:14:22,496
This agreement will never fail

1306
02:14:25,033 --> 02:14:25,658
Look at her!

1307
02:14:27,202 --> 02:14:28,169
...Hey!...

1308
02:14:33,041 --> 02:14:33,837
Is she Vasu's mother?

1309
02:14:34,209 --> 02:14:34,675
No!

1310
02:14:35,376 --> 02:14:36,343
My mother-in-law!

1311
02:14:36,945 --> 02:14:39,505
Sapna,I'm going back by
tonight's flight

1312
02:14:39,714 --> 02:14:40,681
So early?

1313
02:14:40,882 --> 02:14:43,510
The work for which I'm here
is over

1314
02:14:43,718 --> 02:14:44,514
What work?

1315
02:14:45,887 --> 02:14:46,683
Do you want me to tell
the truth?

1316
02:14:46,888 --> 02:14:47,513
Definitely!

1317
02:14:48,556 --> 02:14:50,683
I had come to decide about
my marriage

1318
02:14:50,892 --> 02:14:52,689
What did you decide?

1319
02:14:54,562 --> 02:14:57,531
Oh! this is Coffee!I had
ordered for Tea

1320
02:14:59,234 --> 02:15:02,362
May be my cup of coffee
has come to you

1321
02:15:09,744 --> 02:15:11,371
...I didn't defile your
cup of Coffee

1322
02:15:28,096 --> 02:15:29,063
When did you come back?

1323
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:30,055
This morning!

1324
02:15:33,768 --> 02:15:35,235
You didn't even inform me
before going!

1325
02:15:44,946 --> 02:15:47,915
Got the Ticket?have you sent it?
alright

1326
02:15:51,452 --> 02:15:52,919
Do you want to go to
office early?

1327
02:15:53,288 --> 02:15:53,754
No!

1328
02:15:54,122 --> 02:15:55,749
But,why did you call me
so urgently?

1329
02:15:55,957 --> 02:15:58,755
Madam,a flight Ticket,that travel agent
brought & gave it

1330
02:15:59,127 --> 02:15:59,593
Alright!

1331
02:15:59,961 --> 02:16:02,259
Abdullah! what's the date
today?

1332
02:16:02,463 --> 02:16:03,259
18 December!

1333
02:16:03,464 --> 02:16:04,260
And year?

1334
02:16:04,632 --> 02:16:06,099
Madam?- Come on tell

1335
02:16:06,467 --> 02:16:07,593
1979!

1336
02:16:08,803 --> 02:16:10,600
Isn't it 18th December 1979!?!

1337
02:16:10,805 --> 02:16:12,602
Now,you can go,look here

1338
02:16:12,974 --> 02:16:13,599
What are they?

1339
02:16:13,808 --> 02:16:16,106
They're marriage Invitations
I'm going to post them

1340
02:16:16,311 --> 02:16:17,938
Not necessary!- Go!

1341
02:16:25,486 --> 02:16:26,953
I'm unable to understand anything

1342
02:16:27,155 --> 02:16:29,123
Your silence is making
me go mad

1343
02:16:42,503 --> 02:16:51,468
We are made for each other

1344
02:17:01,856 --> 02:17:02,481
Understood!

1345
02:17:07,195 --> 02:17:09,493
Oh alright! then,you went to
go to Goa,Isn't it?

1346
02:17:12,533 --> 02:17:15,832
Alright! did you meet Sapna?

1347
02:17:17,538 --> 02:17:18,505
Yes,I did meet her!

1348
02:17:20,708 --> 02:17:25,008
Oh! that's why,this new behaviour
this new style

1349
02:17:27,548 --> 02:17:28,515
What did Sapna tell you?

1350
02:17:29,217 --> 02:17:30,844
Sapna told me everything!

1351
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:34,017
About your love...

1352
02:17:35,056 --> 02:17:36,353
About those places...

1353
02:17:37,225 --> 02:17:40,023
.. Where you both used to roam around
with hands on each other's shoulders

1354
02:17:40,728 --> 02:17:42,195
She told about those
day's matters

1355
02:17:42,897 --> 02:17:46,355
.. Which used to come after
a long time of interval

1356
02:17:46,734 --> 02:17:48,201
.. But used to get over
very quickly

1357
02:17:48,903 --> 02:17:51,201
And about your long
live agreement

1358
02:17:51,572 --> 02:17:53,540
...It's big clauses!

1359
02:17:57,412 --> 02:17:59,209
Sapna has told me
everything

1360
02:18:02,250 --> 02:18:02,875
Is it so?

1361
02:18:04,252 --> 02:18:06,379
Didn't she tell about
her marriage?

1362
02:18:07,088 --> 02:18:12,890
Before the agreement could end
she's marrying a rich Bastard

1363
02:18:14,762 --> 02:18:16,389
If I had the rights,which I
had on you till yesterday

1364
02:18:16,764 --> 02:18:20,723
I would've slapped you for
uttering such dirty words

1365
02:18:21,602 --> 02:18:24,901
You met same Tom,Dick & Harry
did you believe whatever said by him?

1366
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:27,908
The man you met in Manglore...

1367
02:18:28,776 --> 02:18:29,902
He likes Sapana.

1368
02:18:30,278 --> 02:18:31,745
But,Sapana doesn't like him.

1369
02:18:35,783 --> 02:18:37,580
There is a big difference
like earth & sky!

1370
02:18:38,119 --> 02:18:39,916
The difference between
Sapna and you

1371
02:18:40,788 --> 02:18:42,756
Sapna Isn't weak minded
like you.

1372
02:18:43,791 --> 02:18:45,759
She never forgot you even
for a moment.

1373
02:18:46,294 --> 02:18:50,594
She's counting every day,every
minute,waiting for you.

1374
02:18:51,799 --> 02:18:52,925
You just tell me only
this much!

1375
02:18:53,801 --> 02:18:55,598
When is your agreement
going to elapse?

1376
02:18:56,304 --> 02:18:58,272
When are you both going
to meet again?

1377
02:18:59,807 --> 02:19:00,273
Come on tell!

1378
02:19:01,476 --> 02:19:04,274
19th December 1979.

1379
02:19:04,812 --> 02:19:05,779
That means... tomorrow?

1380
02:19:06,981 --> 02:19:11,611
Waiting for this day,her eyes
have developed wounds!

1381
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:14,447
How easily you could
forget her?

1382
02:19:14,822 --> 02:19:16,790
And were about to marry me?

1383
02:19:17,158 --> 02:19:20,127
It seems you had once jumped into the
river on a request from Sapna!

1384
02:19:20,495 --> 02:19:22,463
Is it to leave her in the
middle of the stream?

1385
02:19:23,331 --> 02:19:27,290
You know that!

1386
02:19:28,169 --> 02:19:31,969
When I get angry,I lose
my senses

1387
02:19:33,841 --> 02:19:34,967
This is my weakness

1388
02:19:36,844 --> 02:19:38,812
But neither such thing ever
occurred in my life!

1389
02:19:39,013 --> 02:19:41,641
Nor my anger has ever
let me down

1390
02:19:43,017 --> 02:19:44,644
Whatever I heard in Manglore
on that day!

1391
02:19:44,852 --> 02:19:48,151
It didn't even have proper means
to clarify it with Sapna

1392
02:19:48,523 --> 02:19:50,150
What was the necessity
to clarify?

1393
02:19:50,525 --> 02:19:52,993
Couldn't you wait till the
lapsing of the agreement?

1394
02:19:53,361 --> 02:19:54,658
Is that all your care?

1395
02:19:55,196 --> 02:19:57,494
If your heart get's shaken so
much for trivial matters...

1396
02:19:57,865 --> 02:20:01,824
Neither you've any right to
love nor be loved

1397
02:20:03,037 --> 02:20:07,167
Now,you only tell me,what
am I do?

1398
02:20:09,710 --> 02:20:11,007
You want me to tell you
even that

1399
02:20:15,716 --> 02:20:18,514
Take this Ticket to Goa
you leave immediately

1400
02:20:21,556 --> 02:20:23,023
After so much has happened

1401
02:20:24,725 --> 02:20:25,521
...Thank God

1402
02:20:26,394 --> 02:20:28,521
Before that could happen,this
had happened

1403
02:20:29,564 --> 02:20:32,863
That's why,I stopped posting of
wedding Invitations also

1404
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:51,040
Me?.. I'll remain myself

1405
02:20:52,753 --> 02:20:54,050
My loneliness

1406
02:20:54,922 --> 02:20:56,389
...They were with me
earlier also

1407
02:20:58,426 --> 02:20:59,393
Now also,they'll be with
me only

1408
02:21:01,762 --> 02:21:03,559
Nobody will lose anything

1409
02:21:06,934 --> 02:21:07,901
If true love wins

1410
02:21:09,437 --> 02:21:10,404
What more can I ask?

1411
02:21:11,939 --> 02:21:15,568
But,leaving a Goddess
like you...

1412
02:21:16,777 --> 02:21:18,904
Will Sapna forgive me
for this?

1413
02:21:19,447 --> 02:21:23,577
Only if Sapna had known
all this?

1414
02:21:27,121 --> 02:21:28,588
Didn't you tell anything
to Sapna?

1415
02:21:38,633 --> 02:21:45,596
You've become so great,that I can't
look into your eyes & talk

1416
02:21:49,644 --> 02:21:51,771
Alright!where's sir?

1417
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:55,448
No need to talk with my
brother regarding me

1418
02:21:56,484 --> 02:21:58,611
But,Sandhya,how can I
... No..

1419
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:02,619
My marriage will not take place
with you,I'm saying it myself

1420
02:22:03,824 --> 02:22:06,122
Go,Vasu,it's your time
for your flight

1421
02:22:07,161 --> 02:22:07,957
Remember it

1422
02:22:08,829 --> 02:22:11,957
If you don't go today,you'll never be
able to meet Sapna again

1423
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,969
Sapna(dream) will remain a
distant dream for you

1424
02:22:17,171 --> 02:22:17,796
Go!

1425
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:25,301
I don't know,why,but,I feel even now
I may not be able to meet Sapna

1426
02:22:27,515 --> 02:22:32,145
Just tell me only this much,what
did she say before you came back?

1427
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:33,816
Before I came!

1428
02:22:37,358 --> 02:22:38,825
First,she kissed me here

1429
02:22:39,694 --> 02:22:40,661
...That was for me

1430
02:22:41,862 --> 02:22:42,487
Then,here...

1431
02:22:43,698 --> 02:22:44,665
...That was for you

1432
02:23:55,770 --> 02:23:57,897
What happened to the Red vermellion
on your head?

1433
02:24:00,441 --> 02:24:04,070
Fate cried so much,that it got
washed away in it's tears

1434
02:24:04,445 --> 02:24:06,743
Then,whatever I had heard
was true?

1435
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:15,589
He has gone away!and you
didn't even tell me

1436
02:24:18,459 --> 02:24:21,917
Even if,I told you,could you've
changed my fate's path?

1437
02:24:23,130 --> 02:24:23,596
Brother!

1438
02:24:25,132 --> 02:24:31,435
Today,once again,it has been proved that
family life,Isn't written in my fate

1439
02:24:46,987 --> 02:24:48,614
Yes... yes,he has cheated and
escaped from here

1440
02:24:49,156 --> 02:24:51,124
He's reaching Panjim by
morning flight

1441
02:24:51,826 --> 02:24:54,124
I've heard,that he's coming
there to meet some girl

1442
02:24:54,829 --> 02:24:57,798
Come whatever may,don't allow
them to meet

1443
02:24:58,499 --> 02:25:00,296
Break his hands...
break his legs

1444
02:25:01,001 --> 02:25:02,798
If possible,do away with
his life also

1445
02:25:03,003 --> 02:25:03,970
Mr. Belli

1446
02:25:04,505 --> 02:25:08,134
Every drop of whisky,that's flowing
in my veins

1447
02:25:08,342 --> 02:25:09,809
They're always loyal to you

1448
02:25:10,344 --> 02:25:12,642
Can I ever forget your favours?

1449
02:25:13,013 --> 02:25:17,313
Cheating my sister here,and enjoying
with some other girl there

1450
02:25:23,023 --> 02:25:23,648
Understood?

1451
02:25:25,192 --> 02:25:27,319
Take it,as your job is done

1452
02:25:32,867 --> 02:25:33,993
Today,you got up very early?

1453
02:25:34,368 --> 02:25:35,665
I'm waiting for the Sun

1454
02:25:36,036 --> 02:25:36,661
Why?

1455
02:25:37,037 --> 02:25:38,004
Is it Solar Eclipse today?

1456
02:25:38,873 --> 02:25:40,841
It was Eclipsed all the
365 days

1457
02:25:41,375 --> 02:25:43,172
And I couldn't forget
even a day

1458
02:25:44,044 --> 02:25:46,012
It was a year long of
one dark night

1459
02:25:46,714 --> 02:25:48,181
But,today the Eclipse
has got over

1460
02:25:48,883 --> 02:25:51,681
Today's Sun will come
with my life

1461
02:25:52,386 --> 02:25:53,011
...With my Vasu

1462
02:25:53,387 --> 02:25:55,514
Even I too wish,that your
Vasu must return

1463
02:25:56,724 --> 02:25:58,521
But,God's record is there
till now

1464
02:25:59,059 --> 02:26:01,527
He has always been ruthless
with True lovers

1465
02:26:02,396 --> 02:26:06,355
That's why!I'm still with
a hope

1466
02:26:07,234 --> 02:26:07,859
No... NO...

1467
02:26:08,569 --> 02:26:10,036
...My number will always be
second

1468
02:26:11,071 --> 02:26:12,038
First is he...

1469
02:26:13,574 --> 02:26:14,700
Look,Sun has come

1470
02:26:16,577 --> 02:26:18,204
Your Vasu will also
definitely come

1471
02:26:20,247 --> 02:26:25,207
I whole heartedly wish,that you both
should live happily forever

1472
02:26:29,423 --> 02:26:30,890
Has the marriage date
been changed?

1473
02:26:33,093 --> 02:26:34,060
Who told you?

1474
02:26:35,763 --> 02:26:36,730
Senior Boss,was saying...

1475
02:26:37,765 --> 02:26:38,231
With whom?

1476
02:26:39,433 --> 02:26:41,560
He was talking on phone with
Goa's Ram Singh

1477
02:26:43,604 --> 02:26:46,732
He was very angry
... and also over drunk

1478
02:26:47,608 --> 02:26:52,068
I came to know this also...
he was ordering to kill Vasu

1479
02:26:57,284 --> 02:27:02,244
No Sandhya!I'm not so heartless
to take anyone's life

1480
02:27:03,791 --> 02:27:06,589
Last night,in that inebriated mood
don't know,what I told him

1481
02:27:08,295 --> 02:27:11,093
Could I tell him to take
Vasu's life?

1482
02:27:11,465 --> 02:27:12,932
You're a drunkard

1483
02:27:14,134 --> 02:27:18,093
In your drinking binge,you'll not
know what you're doing...

1484
02:27:18,305 --> 02:27:19,272
And what you're blabbering?

1485
02:27:21,642 --> 02:27:24,110
Don't know,which beast wakes
up in you at that time?

1486
02:27:24,979 --> 02:27:26,105
And the man in you sleeps

1487
02:27:32,987 --> 02:27:34,113
What's Goa's Ram Sing's
phone number?

1488
02:27:35,990 --> 02:27:37,617
He has left home early
morning itself

1489
02:27:38,325 --> 02:27:39,451
It seems,he has left home...

1490
02:27:39,994 --> 02:27:41,461
Tell me,what are we
supposed to do now?

1491
02:27:42,329 --> 02:27:44,797
Look,we've to talk with him
regarding a very important matter

1492
02:27:44,999 --> 02:27:46,125
Is there any way that I can get
in touch with him?

1493
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:47,467
Or could you send him
a message?

1494
02:27:48,168 --> 02:27:49,465
Do you know anything about
his whereabouts?

1495
02:27:50,004 --> 02:27:51,130
All I know is,once he
leaves home...

1496
02:27:51,505 --> 02:27:55,965
Even Police can't search
& find him

1497
02:27:56,510 --> 02:27:59,968
Can you give your neighbour
Mr. Sivaram's phone number?

1498
02:28:00,347 --> 02:28:02,474
How can they've phone
at home?

1499
02:28:02,850 --> 02:28:04,818
You may've at least his office
phone number?

1500
02:28:05,853 --> 02:28:06,649
I don't know

1501
02:28:06,854 --> 02:28:08,321
This really is a bad thing

1502
02:28:08,856 --> 02:28:10,824
Vasu has left for home
from here

1503
02:28:11,692 --> 02:28:13,990
But... but...

1504
02:28:14,528 --> 02:28:16,155
His life is in danger

1505
02:28:16,697 --> 02:28:17,493
Oh!God!

1506
02:28:17,698 --> 02:28:18,164
Yes!

1507
02:28:19,033 --> 02:28:19,658
I've understood

1508
02:28:20,034 --> 02:28:21,831
No need to plead so much!

1509
02:28:22,036 --> 02:28:24,334
This is my duty,I'll personally
go & inform them

1510
02:28:25,039 --> 02:28:26,165
You don't worry

1511
02:28:26,707 --> 02:28:27,503
Who's Telephone was it?

1512
02:28:30,878 --> 02:28:34,006
Stop... stop... stop...
enough...

1513
02:28:37,051 --> 02:28:38,177
Take this.
- Sir, I don't have change.

1514
02:28:38,385 --> 02:28:39,181
Keep it with you

1515
02:28:44,558 --> 02:28:45,354
Vasu has come

1516
02:28:46,727 --> 02:28:47,352
Vasu has come

1517
02:28:50,564 --> 02:28:53,692
Hey!Mr. Sivaram!your son is coming
where are you going away?

1518
02:28:54,068 --> 02:28:55,035
...I know it!

1519
02:28:55,569 --> 02:28:56,365
...Why don't you keep quiet
for sometime?

1520
02:28:59,073 --> 02:29:01,041
Son,what's this,you've become
so thin in one year?

1521
02:29:02,076 --> 02:29:02,542
Greetings!

1522
02:29:02,743 --> 02:29:03,539
Wait!I'll get some coffee
for you

1523
02:29:04,078 --> 02:29:06,876
Greetings!son... greetings
are you fine?

1524
02:29:07,414 --> 02:29:09,382
First,I'll greet you by
folding my both hands

1525
02:29:09,917 --> 02:29:12,215
Then,I'll ask,how's your
health keeping now a days?

1526
02:29:13,087 --> 02:29:14,213
Please sit,sir!

1527
02:29:15,255 --> 02:29:19,715
Wow!Great son!you've started
speaking chaste Hindi

1528
02:29:20,260 --> 02:29:21,056
Where's father?

1529
02:29:22,096 --> 02:29:22,721
He has gone inside

1530
02:29:24,765 --> 02:29:26,062
How did you come to
know about it?

1531
02:29:26,266 --> 02:29:28,564
May be,he's feeling embarassed
to show his face to me

1532
02:29:30,270 --> 02:29:31,237
Leave it!I'll be back
in a minute

1533
02:29:32,106 --> 02:29:32,572
Alright!... alright!

1534
02:29:47,121 --> 02:29:48,748
Vasu,where's he?

1535
02:29:49,123 --> 02:29:52,422
Are you both father & son
playing hide & seek?

1536
02:29:52,626 --> 02:29:55,925
No,I thought of giving him sweets
as soon as he comes in

1537
02:29:56,463 --> 02:30:00,263
Greetings mother-in-law
how are you?

1538
02:30:01,301 --> 02:30:03,098
Why're you looking at me like
that?I'm Vasu

1539
02:30:03,804 --> 02:30:06,272
The barrier of time which you
had built,its over now

1540
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:08,107
I've come to marry your
daughter

1541
02:30:08,976 --> 02:30:11,274
But,I don't find any receiptions
for your son-in-law

1542
02:30:11,478 --> 02:30:12,274
Isn't there any grand welcome
for me?

1543
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:17,276
I seek your blessings
Mr. Professor

1544
02:30:17,985 --> 02:30:19,111
How's your health?

1545
02:30:19,653 --> 02:30:20,620
Let my health go to hell

1546
02:30:21,321 --> 02:30:24,119
First,tell me,how could you learn
such good Hindi?

1547
02:30:24,658 --> 02:30:25,784
Firing like a stengun

1548
02:30:26,493 --> 02:30:29,291
It was Mother-in-law's wish, isn't it?
That I must learn Hindi

1549
02:30:29,663 --> 02:30:31,961
Come on tell me,which region's
Hindi shall I talk?

1550
02:30:33,167 --> 02:30:34,293
Delhi's slang?

1551
02:30:35,335 --> 02:30:36,962
Meerut-Moradabadi slang?

1552
02:30:37,838 --> 02:30:39,465
Mathura-Brindavan's Brij slang?

1553
02:30:39,673 --> 02:30:42,801
Ayodhya's Awadhi?Bihar's Bhojpuri?
or Punjab's Punjabi

1554
02:30:44,344 --> 02:30:47,643
Oh!My handsome,my butter sweet
How are you?

1555
02:30:48,515 --> 02:30:50,642
Say something!Oh!uncle
open your mouth

1556
02:30:52,352 --> 02:30:53,649
Uncle,Isn't it Punjabi?

1557
02:30:57,691 --> 02:31:00,319
Mister!why're you staring
at me like this?

1558
02:31:01,028 --> 02:31:04,987
Go inside and inform the bride
that Groom has arrived outside...

1559
02:31:05,365 --> 02:31:06,992
...To marry her

1560
02:31:07,534 --> 02:31:08,660
1000/0 Urdu!

1561
02:31:09,036 --> 02:31:10,333
Great 1000/0 Urdu

1562
02:31:14,875 --> 02:31:16,672
Get up,Mother-in-law,get up

1563
02:31:17,544 --> 02:31:19,512
A heart is beneath your leg!

1564
02:31:20,881 --> 02:31:22,849
It'll be a kind consideration

1565
02:31:23,383 --> 02:31:24,179
This is Lucknow Urdu

1566
02:31:24,718 --> 02:31:25,514
Greetings... greetings!

1567
02:31:27,221 --> 02:31:30,520
Hey!fool!what are you
hearing?

1568
02:31:31,725 --> 02:31:34,193
Won't you go inside and
call my Bride?

1569
02:31:35,395 --> 02:31:37,863
Oh!My God!even we too don't
know such a slang

1570
02:31:38,565 --> 02:31:39,361
Which region's language?

1571
02:31:39,566 --> 02:31:40,032
Avadh!

1572
02:31:42,569 --> 02:31:45,037
Still,you're standing here
come,go away from here

1573
02:31:48,575 --> 02:31:49,371
...Bombay's local slang

1574
02:31:52,412 --> 02:31:57,213
Mother-in-law!you've become
so thin

1575
02:31:58,252 --> 02:31:59,549
Is it yearning for me?

1576
02:32:00,587 --> 02:32:02,714
Wood will burn and become
Charcoal

1577
02:32:02,923 --> 02:32:04,550
Charcoal will burn and
become ash

1578
02:32:04,925 --> 02:32:08,053
I got so much burnt that neither
there was charcoal nor Ash

1579
02:32:10,097 --> 02:32:14,056
Professor!Is it enough,or do you
want anymore Hindi?

1580
02:32:15,102 --> 02:32:17,900
Enough of Hindi!Truely
enough of Hindi

1581
02:32:18,438 --> 02:32:19,735
Firing like a stengun

1582
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:23,398
Professor,tell me only this
why Isn't Sapna seen till now?

1583
02:32:23,944 --> 02:32:26,572
Is she getting dressed
up inside?

1584
02:32:43,130 --> 02:32:45,428
But,you must agree
one thing,sir

1585
02:32:45,966 --> 02:32:48,764
You're the best choice
for Sapna

1586
02:32:49,303 --> 02:32:50,770
But,where's Sapna!

1587
02:32:51,138 --> 02:32:52,264
Don't you know?
- No

1588
02:32:52,806 --> 02:32:53,431
I know!

1589
02:32:55,976 --> 02:32:57,773
Ask me!- Where?

1590
02:33:04,151 --> 02:33:07,279
Isn't there your Love spot?
... near the Sea shore

1591
02:33:07,988 --> 02:33:09,114
There's a mount near
the shore

1592
02:33:09,489 --> 02:33:10,956
There's a temple on the
top of the mount

1593
02:33:11,325 --> 02:33:12,121
And inside the Temple...

1594
02:34:01,375 --> 02:34:03,502
After so many days,I've got
a chance

1595
02:34:05,712 --> 02:34:07,179
God promise!I can't leave it

1596
02:34:40,414 --> 02:34:41,381
No... No...

1597
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:52,618
No... leave me... leave me...

1598
02:36:14,174 --> 02:36:15,141
Leave me!

1599
02:36:18,011 --> 02:36:18,636
No!

1600
02:36:23,016 --> 02:36:23,641
No!

1601
02:37:58,778 --> 02:38:00,746
Police?... Run... Run...

1602
02:39:22,362 --> 02:39:26,492
What happened to you,Vasu?
... You're in such a bad shape...

1603
02:39:28,034 --> 02:39:33,165
This is price of our Love
and our meeting

1604
02:39:36,543 --> 02:39:40,172
I feel,that the entire world
has become our enemy

1605
02:39:45,385 --> 02:39:47,353
What happened to you,Sapna?

1606
02:39:48,221 --> 02:39:54,683
.. My Love,My body...
My chastity...

1607
02:39:55,228 --> 02:39:57,196
Considering all three
as your property...

1608
02:39:57,397 --> 02:39:58,694
...How safely I had gaurded
it for you?

1609
02:39:59,899 --> 02:40:03,357
But,you've come at such a time
when,I'm about to die...

1610
02:40:04,571 --> 02:40:10,373
I'm also holding the last few
breaths only for you

1611
02:40:11,077 --> 02:40:12,374
...Just to meet you

1612
02:40:13,913 --> 02:40:15,881
Come on tell me,what happened?

1613
02:40:16,082 --> 02:40:17,049
Yes... yes!

1614
02:40:18,918 --> 02:40:23,378
My entire pain,all my tears
that's inside my eyes

1615
02:40:23,923 --> 02:40:26,050
Some how, I wished, it
reaches you

1616
02:40:32,265 --> 02:40:34,893
You're disappearing from
my eyes

1617
02:40:35,435 --> 02:40:36,231
No!

1618
02:40:36,603 --> 02:40:39,572
My eyes are getting closed.
I'm dying!...

1619
02:40:39,939 --> 02:40:42,908
No... Vasu... No!
Don't leave me and go away!

1620
02:40:43,610 --> 02:40:49,242
Did we both separate from each other to
meet like this in the embrace of death?

1621
02:40:51,451 --> 02:40:54,249
Before death engulfs me
somehow take me away with you

1622
02:40:54,788 --> 02:40:56,255
Take me away with you

1623
02:40:58,792 --> 02:40:59,759
Come Sapna!

1624
02:42:20,707 --> 02:42:22,504
Love's Language is different

1625
02:42:23,710 --> 02:42:25,007
One who loses in it...

1626
02:42:25,712 --> 02:42:27,179
...They say he has won!

1627
02:42:28,381 --> 02:42:31,680
And one who wins in it...
they say he has lost

1628
02:42:33,219 --> 02:42:35,346
Those who win in this,marry

1629
02:42:36,222 --> 02:42:40,022
And those who lose,give their
lives for one another

1630
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:42,357
And become Immortal!
