1
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,340
(Foot steps)

2
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,370
She is calling you.
There's very little time, please hurry.

3
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,270
(Bird chirping)

4
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,890
(Gasping)

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,260
(Foot steps)

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,840
(Gasps)

7
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,920
As per Ms. Bhavna's will...

8
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,600
...her son, Rahul's inheritance
has been entrusted to you.

9
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,810
Are you her relative?

10
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,320
No.

11
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,980
Did you know her since long?

12
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,800
Since the time she was in school.

13
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,650
The inheritance she's left for
her son has been put in a Trust.

14
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,550
Once all the documents are ready,
they will be sent to you.

15
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,090
Where will you take the child now?

16
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,380
Nainital!

17
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,010
Does your family live there...

18
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,470
No. I live alone.

19
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,310
Will you look after a small child
in this old age?

20
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,550
I mean...

21
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,490
...doesn't he have a father?

22
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,110
Anyway, once the documents are
ready, we will send them to you.

23
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,090

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,350

(Shouting)

31
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,660
Take him away!
...Mummy! Take him away!

32
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,510
(Shouting)

33
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,650
- What's the matter?
- Sister, take the dog away!

34
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,290
How cute!

35
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,550
- Who brought it?
- Dad did.

36
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,930
- You're scared of a tiny dog?
- No way! I'm not scared.

37
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,890
You aren't, right? Now watch!

38
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,430
No! I'll tell mummy!

39
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,930
You aren't scared, right? Look!

40
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,230
(Glass breaks)

41
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,250
DK: It's not possible to have a
cantiliver projection over here.

42
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,730
This point here...
Please let there be light.

43
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,250
You had to provide ramps
from here to this point.

44
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,020
Where is it?

45
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,590
And what are these proportions!
Are you making a theatre?

46
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,420
Cancel it.

47
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,030
CHILDREN: Talking Indistinctly
Dk. Dog's name?

48
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,060
What?

49
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,470
Speak softly, my dear.
What's the matter?

50
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,360
What did the dog do?

51
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,270
I'll be home soon.
Is your mummy there?

52
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,660
DK: No? Thank God!

53
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,130
And listen! If she
returns soon, don't tell her.

54
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,140
I'll be there before she does.
Yes, my dear!

55
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,990
(Reciever sound)

56
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,710
MAN 4: My wife loves dogs, sir.

57
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,610
My wife hates them.

58
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,620
(Bird Chirping)

59
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,560
You get dead tired, going out
in this city in the traffic!

60
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,930
I left at 4 O'clock!

61
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,630
Here are your colour pencils.
Don't lose them again.

62
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,610
Where has the flower vase gone
from here? Who has removed it?

63
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,320
Abdul, get me some water.

64
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,940
(Crow croaking)

65
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,230
- Where has the flower vase gone?
- I don't know.

66
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,220
Nobody in this house ever knows anything!

67
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,730
Here are your pencils.

68
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,110
Hey! Who's kept a cactus
in place of the photo frame?

69
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,180
Bela?

70
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,560
She's always missing!
She's never at home!

71
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,600
Why all of you are sitting so quietly?

72
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,910
C

73
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,100
Can't we sit quietly at home?

74
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,560
(Crow croaking)

75
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,570
Indeed! I know what it means
when all of you sit quietly!

76
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,890
Dad, mummy is going to
the bathroom to wash her face.

77
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,530
Oh! We'll be damned!

78
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,930
Indu... uh... are you
going to the bathroom?

79
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,100
- What!
- Am...

80
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,330
Are you going to wash your face?

81
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,870
- Why?
- For no reason.

82
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,090
I've heard that washing the face
too much spoils the skin.

83
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,480
Where did you hear that?

84
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,020
Well... Mini was saying so.

85
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,650
No, dad! Sister said so.

86
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,410
No! Even I didn't say so!
Mummy, I'd heard it on the radio.

87
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,770
- Yes! We'd heard it on the radio.
- What's wrong with all of you?

88
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,520
MINI: Dad?
- Yes?

89
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,700
We are doomed now!

90
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,710
Yes.

91
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,490
(Dog barks)

92
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,680
(Indu shouts)

93
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,190
INDU: Dk... Dk...

94
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,570
(Dog barks)

95
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,640
Hush...

96
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,600
Take this dog away!
Who brought it here?

97
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,380
I said, take the dog away!

98
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,470
Who brought it here?

99
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,160
I asked, who brought it here?

100
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,130
(Crow Croaking)

101
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,120
Let's go.

102
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,220
(Dog whines)

103
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
I knew it!

104
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,660
- Please let the dog stay here.
- Quiet!

105
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,700
The dog broke a photo frame,
a flower vase and tore a curtain!

106
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,810
These were the disasters
struck on the very first day!

107
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,210
It'll destroy the whole house in
no time! Who'll take care of it?

108
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,610
We'll put a leash around it.

109
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,730
There's no need!
Who asked you to get it?

110
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,190
Bela is not yet here!
She is always missing!

111
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm warning you, I will not keep the dog!

112
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,330
How often have I said,
throw away those glasses!

113
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,230
Hey! How will I read then!

114
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,570
- You look just like a peon!
- So what?

115
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,850
How's your backache?

116
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,610
It's okay now but I had to
stand in the site for 2- 3 hours.

117
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,690
I'll massage it.

118
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,020
(Grunts)

119
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,680
Why do you have to work so much?

120
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,700
(Background music)

121
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,580
Come off it! I work for
you and your children.

122
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,730
Stop it!
You are fond of working!

123
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,710
We have everything.

124
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,330
Everything is what we don't have.

125
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,130
What do we lack?

126
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,460
(Background Music)

127
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,130
A diamond necklace.

128
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,210
Well, who wants one!

129
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,900
Oh really! Then, why were you
lustily eyeing Kanta's necklace?

130
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,850
Nonsense! I was looking at it
because it was so ugly!

131
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,870
I see.

132
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,850
Forget the necklace but you'd
surely want a husband like hers?

133
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,850
Get me the most precious gem,
yet I wouldn't want a man like Suri.

134
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,770
What kind of a husband do you want?

135
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,550
(Background music)

136
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,730
I have one.

137
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,090
Yes, you do. But do sing praises
about him sometimes!

138
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,610
- Indu?
- Yes?

139
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,410
Shall I say something?

140
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,170
Let's keep the puppy at home?

141
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,930
You sly monkey!

142
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,420
(Bird chirping)

143
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,810
Yuck! I'm not going to drink this!
There's cream in it!

144
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,800
Nothing doing! Drink the milk!

145
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,670
Keep your hand down!

146
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,330
How will I drink my coffee then?

147
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,770
Use the other hand.

148
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,690
Keep dad's name as puppy.

149
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,890
Stupid! Keep the puppy's
name as dad!

150
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,840
You stupid!

151
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,510
Stop fighting early in the morning!

152
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,450
- Allow me to take the coffee.
- No!

153
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,970
The puppy drinks milk, not coffee.

154
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,090
I'm not talking about
the puppy... but about dad.

155
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,010
Shall we name him also Mini?

156
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,150
Stupid.

157
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,370
Is that a name!

158
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,680
Naming him Mini will create a problem.

159
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,250
If we call the puppy,
you'll come running...

160
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,220
...and if we call you,
it will come running!

161
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,060
Come on.
Let's go.

162
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,430
When there will be no dog,
what's the use of finding a name?

163
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,460
(Bird chirping)

164
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,490
Have you had your vitamins?

165
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,730
- Have you?
- Yes, dad.

166
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,450
- I'm asking you also.
- Yes, even I've had it.

167
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,060
Dad, you lie?

168
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,030
(Background music)

169
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,420
(Kids are laughing)

170
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,460
Don't forget we have to go to
Mr. Suri's party in the evening.

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,910
- Bye.
- Bye.

172
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,690
There's a tank filled with hot water.

173
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,850
In it, your host, his wife
and you are almost naked!

174
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,930
The pressure of the hot water
massages your body!

175
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,730
And you get tickled all over.

176
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,420
Right.

177
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,920
- Adjust your tie properly!
- What's wrong with it?

178
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,610
- You've come for a party.
- It's okay.

179
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,340
Hey, you Late Kate!

180
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,710
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm fine. What about you?

181
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,570
By the grace of God you came atleast.

182
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,660
Namaste Mrs. Indu.

183
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,890
- Suri, how are you?
- Absolutely fine.

184
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,690
Mr. Suri, DK will not
drink too much today.

185
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,170
- The question does not arise!
- Indeed! He gets high with 2 pegs!

186
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,100
- Suri, no drinking today.
- No drinking today.

187
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,770
And listen... please don't
recite couplets either!

188
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,310
I can't promise that.

189
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,190
But no drinking. That's a promise.

190
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,200
All right! But do everything
within your limits, DK!

191
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,810
Let's have a very large peg.

192
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,700
Come on. You start.

193
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,050
I had no idea that
there'd be so many people.

194
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,810
Bring a glass of champagne for him.

195
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,040
We'll have a large peg later.

196
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,980
Dk, I want you to meet
the chairman of FDCC.

197
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,280
(Indistinct)

198
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,960
Why should I meet him.

199
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,260
Contacts mean contacts.

200
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,260
Dk, contacts.
Contacts mean contracts. Right?

201
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,720
Listen to what I say!

202
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,390
(Foreign language)

203
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,330
Son, he makes films. Deliver
the dialogues from Sholay'.

204
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,450
"How many men were there?"
"Two, sir."

205
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,530
"And you were three.
Yet, you returned empty-handed!"

206
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,810
He's good, isn't he?

207
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,940
- INDU: Hello, Chanda.
- Hi.

208
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,410
You were to phone me
day before yesterday!

209
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,750
I was busy, I had to go out.

210
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,770
You are always busy with your work!

211
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,290
You were going to
quit smoking, weren't you?

212
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,810
- From tomorrow.
- Tomorrow indeed!

213
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

214
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,940
- Hello Sir, I want you to me my child.
- Hello.

215
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,070
This is my brother, DK Malhotra.

216
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,440
- How do You do.
- I'm fine.

217
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,410
Hadn't you worn the
same one for Sheetal's party?

218
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,610
They are very beautiful.

219
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,450
- Hasn't Ratna come?
- I did call her.

220
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,810
But you know her condition.

221
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,330
Idiot! She keeps crying, and that
too away from her husband's eyes.

222
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,650
She doesn't protest by
either fighting or crying!

223
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,750
Meaning?

224
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:06,550
(People chattering)

225
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,610
(Sighs)

226
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,930
Remember, DK, in those days,
your athleticism...

227
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,770
And my naughtiness...

228
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,930
How many girls went crazy!

229
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,770
Any letters from the Major?

230
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,290
It's a thing of the past.
Forget it!

231
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,850
Have you forgotten?

232
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,730
Why do you worry?
Don't I look fine?

233
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,770
"Raise not your hands and arch backwards"

234
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,010
"Take a look at your bosom"

235
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,570
"As slowly slides down your veil"

236
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,390
Wow! What a couplet!

237
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,370
Remember, there was a song...

238
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:07,080
"O' lovely maiden, walk not
with your nose in the air"

239
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,010
Should we sing?

240
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,310
Will you sing?

241
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,610
You start.

242
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,850
(Coughs)

243
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,300
Ok. (Coughs)

244
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,580
- Suri!
- YEs.

245
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,010
I have a bad throat.
Why don't you begin?

246
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,650
- Putting up your price, huh?
- No way!

247
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,860
- Your voice is better.
- I've got a better voice?

248
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,330
You start, I'll join you.

249
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,230
(Humming)

250
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,860
What are you doing!

251
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,990
- Alaap?
- Yes.

252
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,010
It was kind of that.

253
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,670
(Coughs)

254
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,340
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

255
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,780
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

256
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:18,410
"Please don't stroll
in such a carefree manner."

257
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,030
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

258
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,540
"Please don't stroll
in such a carefree manner."

259
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:36,860
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

260
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,840
"If a teaser grips
the corner of your 'dupatta'."

261
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,750
"If a teaser grips
the corner of your 'dupatta'."

262
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,240
"Just think what you would do then."

263
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,840
"If he adorns your hair with flowers.."

264
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,620
"If he adorns your hair with flowers.."

265
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,080
"Will you jerk them off your tresses?"

266
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,710
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

267
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,310
"Please don't stroll
in such a carefree manner."

268
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:48,300
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

269
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,790
"How lovely is your laughter."

270
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:31,410
"How lovely is your laughter."

271
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:37,250
"But don't scatter
these pearls thoughtlessly."

272
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,730
"For the wind might take them away
with a strong gust."

273
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:48,600
"For the wind might take them away
with a strong gust."

274
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,990
"Take care not to sway
your sensual body."

275
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,220
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

276
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,020
"Please don't stroll
in such a carefree manner."

277
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,920
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

278
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:33,910
"Everything about you is exquisite,
however."

279
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,170
"Everything about you is exquisite,
however."

280
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,440
"Had you a heart,
how wonderful it would have been."

281
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,470
"Then a tale of love would have been
written on you."

282
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,960
"Then a tale of love would have
been written on you."

283
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,510
"A tale that would have made it
a meeting with you."

284
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,980
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

285
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,930
"Please don't stroll
in such a carefree manner."

286
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,200
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

287
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:28,850
"Please don't stroll
in such a carefree manner."

288
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:35,950
"O highness, please don't walk
with such an attitude."

289
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,130
- How is Ratna now?
- I don't know.

290
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,980
Ratna!

291
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,220
(Sobbing)

292
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,390
Lie straight.

293
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,760
(Gasping)

294
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,740
No, Ratna, don't cry.

295
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,740
(Sobbing)

296
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,090
Was your problem solved by
swallowing sleeping pills? No!

297
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,410
You should have given them
to your husband instead!

298
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,410
Or to his mistress!

299
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,460
What will you gain by dying?

300
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,680
Quiet, Chanda! Is this
the time to scold her?

301
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,210
(Door open sound)

302
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,070
(Grunts)

303
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,290
You're here?

304
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,010
What have you come to take now?

305
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,440
You've put Ratna in this state!
What more do you want to do?

306
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,100
- Please be quiet, Chanda.
- Why should I?

307
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,560
Somebody has to speak!

308
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,010
Should everyone be quiet like her
and let this man do as he please?

309
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,010
Let's go... We'll leave now.

310
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,290
Come on.

311
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,930
Think and talk!

312
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,000
If you were in her shoes,
would you think and talk?

313
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,120
Sleeping pills do not solve problems.

314
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,020
(Dk sighs)

315
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,890
But her husband is also crazy.

316
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,810
How can he change,
even after having children?

317
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,450
If you can't bear the
responsibility, why get married?

318
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,170
Mummy, if I were not born,
what would have happened?

319
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,450
Then there would have been
a baby boy in your place!

320
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,900
My brother.

321
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,570
- Not yours but mine!
- He'd have been my brother too.

322
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,470
How would he, stupid!
You wouldn't be born!

323
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,770
(Background music)

324
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,260
You, stupid!

325
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,930
Don't! Does one talk this way
with an elder sister?

326
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,210
Does one speak this way
with a younger sister?

327
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,510
I'll beat you!
You call me stupid!

328
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,140
Hey, you'll fall!

329
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,420
(Laughs)

330
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,900
That's enough now!

331
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,110
(Sighs)

332
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,320
Go to your room.

333
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,710
Indu, suppose you had a baby boy, then?

334
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,720
I have one.

335
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,690
Where is he?
Have you hidden him?

336
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,090
Here he is!
Isn't he enough for me?

337
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,610
(Sighs)

338
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,430
But, lucky, Indu!

339
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,730
Why?

340
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,450
You have one, I don't.

341
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,570
You don't even tell me whether
I've received a reply or not.

342
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,490
If there was, then I'd have
come to you immediately.

343
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,900
Why do you worry when I'm around?

344
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,800
(Bird chirping)

345
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,950
Worried, I certainly am.

346
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,730
About this boy.
After all, I'm getting older.

347
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,410
Here, send him a telegram this time.

348
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,700
(Bird chirping)

349
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,930
Get yourself treated properly.

350
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,050
- Is there a cure for old age?
- Why do you talk like this...

351
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,440
Go and send a telegram immediately.

352
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,770
(Passing car sound)

353
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,210
- There's a telegram.
- From whom?

354
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,110
Gurudayal Singh!

355
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,750
Gurudayal Singh?

356
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,530
From Nainital?

357
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,930
He's asked you to come at once,
as there's some important work.

358
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,560
- Who is he?
- The headmaster of my old school.

359
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,090
Gurudayal Singh!

360
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,570
- Anything important?
- I don't know.

361
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,530
He has never before...

362
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,720
- I haven't met him since years.
- Then?

363
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,720
I'll phone him from office.

364
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,780
(Sighs)

365
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,020
(Typewriter sound)

366
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,470
(People chatting)

367
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,220
Two photocopies!

368
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,940
No, not you.

369
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,140
(Bell ringing)

370
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,270
(Typewriter sound)

371
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,290
- Gupta, check this.
- Morning, sir.

372
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,770
- Sir!
- Yeah?

373
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,410
Bring it in.

374
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,970
Mr. Dhawan is waiting for you.

375
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,970
- Is the new client here?
- Yes.

376
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,010
- What's his name?
- Mr. Bansal.

377
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,090
Listen... get me a trunk call
to Nainital. This is the number.

378
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,520
- It's urgent. Thanks
- Okay. Okay.

379
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,950
This is the International Trade Centre.

380
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,010
And this is the embassy.

381
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,830
And yes! This is Neelkamal
Building, of which you mentioned.

382
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,090
These are its schematic designs.

383
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,080
(Door knock)

384
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,110
Come in!

385
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,930
DK. We were waiting
for you... This is Mr. Bansal.

386
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,490
- Mr. Malhotra, my junior partner.
- How do you do, sir?

387
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,930
Please sit, DK.

388
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,030
Mr. Bansal, DK is my brightest architect.

389
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,370
He wants to build a complex.
Bansal Bhavan... is that the name?

390
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:27,860
BANSAL: Yes.

391
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,690
He wants us to give him a proposal.

392
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,890
You will be giving
the first presentation.

393
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,710
I was showing him the schematic
designs of Neelkamal Building.

394
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,940
(Grunts)

395
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,450
- You explain to him.
- Sure.

396
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,570
No. Mr. Gurudayal has retired.

397
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,430
- Please give me his phone number.
- He doesn't have a phone.

398
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,130
Who's speaking?

399
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,930
DK from Delhi. I've received
a telegram from Mr. Gurudayal.

400
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,130
- Are you DK Malhotra?
- Yes. Who are you?

401
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,300
- My name is Tiwari.
- DK: Tiwari

402
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,370
I had sent you the telegram.
The master had sent a letter too.

403
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,250
- I haven't received the letter.
- You haven't?

404
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,770
But I did get his telegram.
Mr. Tiwari, what work did he have?

405
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,450
It's something very personal...

406
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,620
- Hello! Hello...
- Hello!

407
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:14,850
- What work did he have?
- Are you really DK Malhotra?

408
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,620
(Tch)

409
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,810
Yes, I am DK speaking!
What work did he have?

410
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,630
He's asked you to come
to Nainital. Your son...

411
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,060
- Hello! Hello!
- Hello!

412
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,560
- Mr. Tiwari! Hello!
- Yes.

413
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,800
What did the master say?

414
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,530
He says he has very little time, and...

415
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,660
All right! But what
work does he have with me?

416
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,660
He wants you to take away
your son from here.

417
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,780
Son!

418
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,430
Whose son?

419
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,650
I have no son.
What are you talking about?

420
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:44,870
Hello!

421
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,140
Hello?

422
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,030
(Taps phone)

423
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,540
- Hello!
- Hello!

424
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,550
Hello!

425
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,540
Hello! Operator? Hello! Hello!

426
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,490
Hello, Mr. Tiwari? Hello!

427
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,250
What is the matter? Do you know
what else the master has said?

428
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,730
Yes. A small boy
lives in his house.

429
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,010
Since the time his mother
left him with the master...

430
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,740
Hello! Who's left him?

431
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,530
His mother Bhavna.

432
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,160
Bhavna?

433
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,100
(Background music)

434
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,820
Bhavna!

435
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,770
I see.

436
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,350
I need just a minute.

437
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,030
Yes, Mr. Tiwari?

438
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,770
Hello! Hello!

439
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,160
Hello! Mr. Tiwari? Hello!

440
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,810
Bastard! Hello!

441
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,770
- Worked up about something?
- No.

442
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,130
Did you phone Nainital?

443
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,930
Yes. The master was not there but
I spoke to a man named Mr. Tiwari.

444
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,850
Indu, he said...

445
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,180
What did he say?

446
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,120
He said that the master was unwell...

447
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,220
The line was bad,
I couldn't hear properly.

448
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,730
But he did say that
the master was unwell.

449
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,160
Send him some money for his treatment.

450
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,750
- Indu, that's not all.
- Then what is it?

451
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,100
Leave me alone, Indu.

452
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,270
Please.

453
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,930
I have some problem.

454
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,450
What is that problem
of yours which isn't mine?

455
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,160
(Background music)

456
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,400
What is it?

457
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,890
Nothing.

458
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,930
It's an office problem.

459
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,940
(Background music)

460
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,560
Okay.

461
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,640
(Telephone ringing)

462
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,940
DK.

463
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,660
- It's me.
- Yes, Indu?

464
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,810
There's a letter from Nainital.
Shall I read it?

465
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,940
- Have you read it?
- No. I've not even opened it.

466
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,630
- Shall I open it?
- No, don't.

467
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,100
I'll come home in the evening
and read it. Okay?

468
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:22,140
Or I'll send the office peon.
Give it to him.

469
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,930
- Okay?
- Okay.

470
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,710
(Reciever sound)

471
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,400
(Background music)

472
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,330
DK: Anita, cancel all appointments.

473
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,250
- That Mr...
- I said cancel them!

474
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,690
But, sir...

475
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,370
(Car engine starts)

476
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,670
(Gear sounds)

477
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,350
MASTER JI: DK, she never wanted you
to know about this child.

478
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:04,090
When I learnt about it
after the child was born...

479
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,970
...Bhavna had said
just one thing.

480
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:12,610
Do not tell DK, since he has
his own life... his own family.

481
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,110
(Car horn) (Tire scratches)

482
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:22,050
That child neither laughs nor cries.

483
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,830
He keeps staring out
of the window all day long.

484
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,450
Waiting for, I wonder, whom.
(Background music)

485
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,090
It appears as if his childhood
is vanishing at such a young age.

486
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,890
I cannot give him anything in my old age.

487
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:40,810
He needs a mother,
a father... a family, DK.

488
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,420
He asks me questions whose
answers I can't say, but you can.

489
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,610
(Cars horn)

490
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,800
(Background music)

491
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,250
Son, I won't live very long now.

492
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,250
Before I die, I want
to send your son to you.

493
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,240
- "So sing, may peace"
- (Singing along)

494
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,160
- "Be with everyone"
- (Singing along)

495
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,540
- "So sing, may peace"
- (Singing along)

496
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:15,560
- "Be with everyone"
- (Singing along)

497
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,940
- "Peace be with everyone"
- (Singing along)

498
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,050
Mummy, shout at her!

499
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,460
Stupid, shut it!

500
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,210
You stupid! They are
showing Chintu's songs!

501
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,580
- "So sing, may peace"
- (Singing along)

502
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,910
- Mummy, ask her to shut it!
- Concentrate here!

503
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,190
- "May peace"
- (Singing along)

504
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,690
What to do about this?

505
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,570
- Make blocks of these sums.
- How do you do that?

506
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,140
That's what I don't know,
so I'm asking you.

507
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,450
Oh, God! Your New Math is tough!

508
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,210
Mini, stop your chorus!

509
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,360
They are showing Chintu's songs.

510
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,200
Is Chintu your uncle?

511
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,270
- "Peace be with everyone"
- (Singing along)

512
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,970
Shut it!

513
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,290
Mummy, please! They're showing
Uncle Chintu's songs!

514
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,370
It's disturbing.

515
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,380
- Forget that. Mummy, first tell me...
- Mummy, please.

516
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,830
Stop it, Mini!

517
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,850
Mummy, I stand first in all the
other subjects except Maths...

518
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,650
- Mummy! You tell me first...
- Oh DK!

519
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,480
Mummy!

520
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,370
Dad, you're here!

521
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,960
Dad, they were showing Uncle
Chintu's songs but mummy shut it!

522
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,090
Who's Uncle Chintu?

523
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,020
Damn! How many times have I
told you about Uncle Chintu!

524
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,740
Quiet! ...Dad, I just
cannot solve this sum.

525
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,170
Ask mummy.

526
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,800
She doesn't know.
You explain, dad.

527
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,930
Indu?

528
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,230
No way! Thank God, you've come.
You handle them!

529
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,410
Will you have tea?

530
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,650
- Yes.
- Dad, please explain!

531
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,500
- Add little sugar.
- Dad, solve the sum first.

532
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,670
Fine.

533
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,970
Doing Winky's homework is beyond me.

534
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,360
In any case, I was weak in Math.

535
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,410
And I don't know about these new
blocks to be made in New Math.

536
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,730
From now on, you manage her.

537
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,210
If that fatso stands first in
class, Winky will not forgive me!

538
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,110
Get up!

539
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,300
Won't you change your clothes?

540
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,470
Indu?

541
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,680
I want to tell you something.

542
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,410
Go ahead.

543
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,090
You won't like it.

544
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,060
(Background music)

545
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,330
What's it?

546
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,330
Let it be.
I'll tell you some other time.

547
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,860
(Stammers)

548
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,210
It's nothing.

549
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,980
Please, DK! Don't say this.

550
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,850
(Dog barks in distant)

551
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,150
What is it?

552
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,300
Indu?

553
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,040
There was another girl in my life.

554
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,610
- Don't joke about such matters.
- DK: I am not joking, Indu.

555
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,870
(Sighs)

556
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,790
(Background music)

557
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,580
I am not joking.

558
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:11,020
(Background music)

559
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,950
When I... had gone... there...

560
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,800
- Where?
- To Nainital.

561
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,440
For the school's Old Boys' function...

562
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,280
At that time...

563
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,420
...Winky was going to be born.

564
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,290
Yes.

565
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,460
I met her there.

566
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,010
Who?

567
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,680
Bhavna... that girl.

568
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,720
Indu?

569
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,280
(Stammers)

570
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,900
I...

571
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,370
I don't know...
how I couldn't control myself.

572
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,700
Perhaps because I was alone,
and... so was she.

573
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,220
(Sobbing)

574
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,310
I went to her house once and...

575
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,690
...at her insistence,
I stayed back at night.

576
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,340
I shouldn't have stayed back...
I shouldn't have stayed...

577
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,850
- but...
- Oh DK!

578
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,870
(Sobbing)

579
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,020
Stop it!

580
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,970
Stop it!

581
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,540
(Background music)

582
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,260
Indu?

583
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,140
I never ever saw her
after that... I swear!

584
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,580
And even then, I shared
nothing special with her.

585
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,920
You shared nothing special?

586
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,980
What can be more special than this, DK?

587
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,280
(Sobbing)

588
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,400
So, what does she want now?

589
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,410
Nothing. She's dead.

590
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,870
She's dead.

591
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,040
Then?

592
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,680
Indu...

593
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,890
She has a son from me.

594
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,160
Oh God, DK!

595
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,350
No! Don't say that!

596
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,340
(Sobbing)

597
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,810
What's happening!
Please don't say that!

598
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,240
(Sobbing)

599
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,100
I'm very scared.

600
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,340
(Sobbing)

601
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,680
- DK: Please!
- PINKY: Mommy!

602
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,300
(Sobbing)

603
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,410
Mommy!

604
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,770
(Background music)

605
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,610
(Sobbing)

606
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,720
Winky dear, go and sleep.

607
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:38,840
(Background music)

608
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,610
(Indu crying)

609
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,270
(Vessels sound)

610
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,530
(Vessels sound)

611
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,680
"Tayyab Ali, love's enemy!"

612
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,730
"Love's enemy, life's enemy!"

613
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,130
"Tayyab Ali, love's enemy!"

614
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,350
- "Love's enemy, life's enemy!"
- Mumma?

615
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,770
Hi, there, stranger!

616
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:42,860
- Hi, DK!
- Hi, Suri!

617
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,580
You said you've been busy.
So what brings you here today?

618
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,930
I want to talk to you...
There's a big problem.

619
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,640
(Gasps)

620
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:55,010
With Bansal? If you want, I'll
phone him now and fix matters.

621
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,650
- No. Listen to me.
- Tell me something.

622
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,670
(Grunts)

623
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,490
If your company acquires that
contract, what'll be your share?

624
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,010
- That's not the problem.
- Then?

625
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,250
- It's something else.
- Then, let's solve the problem!

626
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,110
Mr. Suri, how was the game?

627
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:13,210
Please don't joke. Doing business
and drinking whisky is my forte.

628
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,650
Else, even I would be preparing
for Wimbledon like my son!

629
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,170
- Right?
- Oh no!

630
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,450
(Sighs)

631
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,950
DK, the joy of watching your son grow!

632
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,530
It wasn't the same even in my youth!

633
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,110
You must have a son, dude!

634
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,890
A son is important.

635
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,650
Your son must be handling
your business now, right?

636
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,810
I'll leave now.

637
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,210
Hey, you wanted to discuss
a problem. What is it?

638
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,420
(Background music)

639
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,070
- What's it?
- We'll talk later.

640
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,300
- Okay.
- Okay, okay. Bye.

641
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,860
He's my brother.

642
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,470

643
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,740

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,800
Yes, I will inform him.

647
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,040
(Typewriter sound)

648
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,480
(Stammers) Hello!

649
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,230
(Stammers)

650
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,590
Hello!

651
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,020
Hello, Mr. Malhotra!

652
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,410
BOSS: Mr. Bansal, this is
a foundation problem.

653
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,450
As per Mr. Malhotra's
original estimates...

654
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,150
...you'll find mica content
at a depth of 40 feet.

655
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,280
- But as per the...
- Oh, God!

656
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,150
Sorry, sir.
I have to go home. Excuse me.

657
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,730
(Car engine starts)

658
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,770
- Indu, where are you going?
- Anywhere! I don't know!

659
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,770
Please listen to me!

660
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,290
I don't want to listen!

661
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:03,710
Please listen to me for a minute!

662
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,960
(Sighs)

663
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,820
Please!

664
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,510
(Sighs)

665
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,390
(Car door shuts)

666
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,220
I didn't know that the boy
was going to come here.

667
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,220
- Stop lying!
- I swear, I didn't know!

668
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,810
Come what may, that boy is
not going to come to this house!

669
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,310
- Do you need the taxi or not?
- We don't want it!

670
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,540
(Bird chirping)

671
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,860
Take this.

672
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,370
Indu, listen! (Car engine starts)

673
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,690
Just for a few days!

674
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,130
Please, Indu! What can I
do now if he's coming here?

675
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,930
Do what you want, but he
is not going to come here!

676
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:39,250
I promise he won't stay here
for more than 2- 3 days.

677
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,730
I promise.

678
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,610
I do not trust you anymore!

679
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,740
You'd said, my problem is yours too.
Won't you help me this time?

680
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,890
Mummy, ask sister to return
my scented rubber!

681
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,850
Quiet! It was my rubber!
So what if I took it?

682
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,230
What do you want? That you
do any wrong and I endure it?

683
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:04,040
I'm also human, I have feelings.
Have you ever thought about that?

684
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,820
And these children...
what will you tell them?

685
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:10,130
I'll beat you!
Mummy, just look at her!

686
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,490
Mummy, two of my sums were wrong!

687
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,940
Come on, I'll show you.

688
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,660
Come on, mummy!

689
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,640
(Gasping)

690
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,850
Dad, please carry me.

691
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,280
(Bird chirping)

692
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,260
(Tch)

693
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,040
Now take me inside.

694
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,500
(Bird chirping)

695
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,340
Mini and Winky, please come here.

696
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,190
What's it?

697
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,520
A boy will be coming
to stay in our house.

698
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,010
- Who is he?
- His name is...

699
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,620
(Background music)

700
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,210
His mummy is dead,
so he's coming to stay with us.

701
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,290
But who was his mummy?

702
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,490
She was our distant relative.

703
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,710
Mummy, how old is he?

704
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,200
He...

705
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,360
(Background music)

706
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,480
He is 8- 9 years old.

707
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,220
Such a small boy! My exams are
nearing, he won't let me study!

708
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,210
No. He'll play with me.

709
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,420
Where is his father?
Why doesn't he go to him?

710
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:32,730
His father has gone away.

711
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:34,730
Leaving him behind?

712
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,130
My dad would have never done that!

713
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,250
INDU: Children, go to
your room and sleep.

714
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,980
- Good night, dad!
- Good night, dad!

715
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,780
- MINNI: Good night, mommy!
- INDU: Good night!

716
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,920
PINKY: Good night, mommy!

717
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:51,800
- Come on, hurry.
- Indu?

718
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,940
Now we'll have fun.

719
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:54,210
It will be no fun!

720
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,670
Thank you, Indu.

721
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,250
You took care.

722
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,200
I was taking care of my children!

723
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,300
(Train engine sound)

724
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:21,810

(Car honks)

727
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,530
Shall I roll the window down?

728
00:45:55,360 --> 00:46:01,780
(Background music)

729
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,390
(Grunts)

730
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,690
Look, that's the old Fort.

731
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:26,170
It's a... very old... fort!

732
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,370
It was built by Sher Shah Suri
...or perhaps Humayun...

733
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:34,930
There's a big zoo inside now.
There are many animals and a...

734
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,440
Did you know my mummy?

735
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,180
(Background music)

736
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,810
Y... y... yes. Yes, I did know her.

737
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,850
And dad?

738
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,640
Not dad.

739
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,330
(Background music)

740
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,610
Mummy used to say that
I'll surely find my dad.

741
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:59,910
Even mummy is no more. If dad
does come, how will he find me?

742
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,840
He will, son... he will find you.

743
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,490
Mini, he is Rahul.

744
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,140
Rahul, this is Minni.

745
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,500
- Hi!
- Hello!

746
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,960
Pinky, come here!

747
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,330
Rahul, she is Winky.

748
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,870
- Pinky, he is Rahul.
- Hello.

749
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:30,700
Hello!

750
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,510
She is my mummy...
Mummy, he is Rahul.

751
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,690
Greetings!

752
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,800
Hello!

753
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,680
Will Rahul sleep in my room?

754
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,280
No. His bed has been
put in the study.

755
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,520
But I study there.

756
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,080
My dear, it's a matter
of only a few days.

757
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:55,260
Abdul, keep his baggage in the study.

758
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:04,530
Both of you come upstairs.

759
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,160
(Background music)

760
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,130
Get up, this is my place.
I sit with dad.

761
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,520
Go and sit there.

762
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,950
Abdul... has not brought the rice.

763
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,840
I had a puppy whose name was also Mini.

764
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,040
Eat quietly, Mini.

765
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,280
When dad used to call
the puppy, I'd come running.

766
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,080
And when he'd call me,
the puppy would come running.

767
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:26,830
Mini!

768
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,960
Mummy is upset today.

769
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,020
Indu, aren't you going to eat?

770
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:05,000
"Two eyes and one story."

771
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:17,230
"Two eyes and one story."

772
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,860
"A little bit of cloud."

773
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,110
"Little bit of water."

774
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,550
"And one story."

00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:33,430
"Two eyes and one story."

00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:36,140
"A little bit of cloud."

00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,820
"Little bit of water."

778
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,930
"And one story."

00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:50,270
"Two eyes and one story."

780
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,160
"This is small in two parts."

781
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,240
"It keeps on flowing."

782
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,250
"This is small in two parts."

783
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,100
"It keeps on flowing."

784
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:37,580
"Let someone listen or not."

785
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,380
"It keeps on narrating."

786
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:48,460
"Sometimes in writing sometimes orally."

787
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,770
"A little bit of cloud."

788
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,330
"Little bit of water."

789
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:58,570
"And one story."

"Two eyes and one story."

791
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,730
"It is kind of old one.."

792
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,970
"..but still new."

793
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,890
"It is kind of old one.."

794
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,880
"..but still new."

795
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:55,480
"Where the tears stop.."

796
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,310
"..is the full stop to the story."

797
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,340
"It is new but still old one."

798
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,500

"If this gets over.."

803
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,150
"..the others get into remembrance."

804
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,650
"If this gets over.."

805
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,960
"..the others get into remembrance."

806

"Then again the lips narrate
the forgotten things."

00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,800
"And one story."

811
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:38,910
"Two eyes and one story."

812
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,820
(Crickets chirping)

813
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,800
Son.

814
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,360
What are you doing all alone here?

815
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,440
Gazing at the stars.

816
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,520
Why?

817
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,350
Mummy used to say that
if you see a shooting star...

818
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,520
...your wish gets fulfilled.

819
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,770
Look, uncle, a shooting star!

820
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,110
- Where is it?
- It's disappeared.

821
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,910
- Did you wish for something?
- Yes.

822
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,350
- What?
- I can't tell you.

823
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Why?

824
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,600
I see... Should we go inside?

825
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:30,520
Yes, son?

826
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,000
Shall I tell you what I wished for?

827
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,120
I prayed that I'd find my dad.

828
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,460
(Background music)

829
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,840
Come on, dad, it's getting late.

830
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,840
Dad, come on.
It's getting very late.

831
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,430
He's taking so long.

832
00:55:56,530 --> 00:55:58,640
(Birds chirping)

833
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:03,080
(Crow croaking)

834
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,240
The children are getting late.

835
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:15,350
(Background music)

836
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,830
Did you know my mummy?

837
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,250
No!

838
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,080
But uncle knew her.

839
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,890
I know!

840
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,820
What is it? Why are you
looking at me that way?

841
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,600
Even my mummy used to wear
a similar floral print sari.

842
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,860
Fine... Let me work now.

843
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,560
And how have you let
that boy stay in your house?

844
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,440
I haven't. He just came home.

845
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,600
What could I do?

846
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,620
Whenever I see him,
I think of DK and that girl.

847
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,510
Chanda, it seems as if
all relationships are a farce.

848
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,840
(Background music)

849
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,010
It seems as if...

850
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,420
(Sighs)

851
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,480
...such incidents occur
only in other people's lives.

852
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,170
I feel... cheated Chanda.

853
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,840
I don't know what to do now.

854
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,000
(Sobbing)

855
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,210
I... sorry Chanda!

856
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,720
Indu, the weaker you become,
the more you will have to endure.

857
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,070
Yes, I'll be there.

858
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,580
I'll be back in a jiffy.

859
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,490
You know very well, I do not like
incompetence of any kind, at all.

860
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,890
Just don't forget!

861
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,470
When the Major left me,
even I'd felt defeated like you.

862
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,360
But look at me now.
What do I lack?

863
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,400
I work, I live for myself,
...the way I want to!

864
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,430
Like a free woman.

865
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,610
And don't you miss your son?

866
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,640
25+...

867
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,990
- Shall I recite a poetry for you?
- No need! I'm studying!

868
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,160
Please.

869
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,900
I said, I'm studying!

870
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,250
"Who created
the sparrows that fly?"

871
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,650
MINNI: Mummy!

872
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,640
- All right, I'll go.
- I'll beat you!

873
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,140
MINNI: Mummy!

874
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,950
Brother Rahul.

875
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,720
Shall I recite a poetry for you?

876
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,480
Yes, please.

877
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:59,940
"Who created
the sparrows that fly?"

878
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:07,640
"Who created you and me?"

879
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,410
"The Lord is present in everything"

880
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,200
Whose picture is this?

881
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,520
My dad's.

882
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,120
Is this how your dad looks?

883
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,880
I don't know.
Perhaps this is how he looks.

884
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,560
Where's he?

885
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,760
He must be dead.

886
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,590
No! Mummy used to say that
he has gone very far away.

887
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,760
And that he'd surely return someday.

888
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:44,000
I'd seen another child's father
go somewhere far away, on TV.

889
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,280
His mummy too had said that
his father would return.

890
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,360
But he was dead.
And the boy didn't even know!

891
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:52,410
Films are not reality.

892
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,320
Yes, indeed. They are films.

893
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,360
I'll tell dad.
He'll find your father.

894
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,120
How will he find him?

895
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,880
My dad is very clever.
Watch, he will find your father!

896
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,310
Mini! ...What are you doing here?

897
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,470
Playing with Brother Rahul.

898
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,700
Go and sleep.

899
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:14,810
(Dog barks at distance)

900
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,180
Since when did Rahul become your brother?

901
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,380
What's that you're swallowing?

902
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,680
Sleeping pills.

903
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,860
Will taking sleeping pills
solve anything?

904
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,740
(Background music)

905
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,640
How often have I apologised to you!

906
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:46,170
How often have I admitted
that I've indeed made a mistake!

907
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,440
Can't you forget it?

908
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,140
How can I?

909
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,480
I was leading a farcical
relationship for 10 years!

910
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,540
You cheated me for 10 years!

911
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:59,920
You call this relationship a farce?

912
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,450
Are you calling those
two children a farce?

913
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,380
- If our children are...
- Even she had a child.

914
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,850
Will you call that a farce?

915
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:17,070
(Background music)

916
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:22,650
Believe me, I didn't know about this child.

917
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,110
- If I had known...
- What would you have done then?

918
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,700
Left us?

919
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,220
Indu.

920
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,390
Don't touch me!

921
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,800
(Dog barks at distance)

922
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:47,940
(Background music)

923
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,700
Hello. Is that
Mr. DK Malhotra speaking?

924
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,090
My name is...

925
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,980
Hey, I'm Suri here.

926
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,410
You've become very lazy!
Do you know it's Sunday today?

927
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,120
Do you have to visit sites today?
Aren't you coming to the farm?

928
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,480
No, Suri. I can't come.
I am not in the mood.

929
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:18,330
Not in the mood?
I'll take care of your mood!

930
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:23,160
Suri, listen! I think
even Indu isn't in the mood.

931
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,320
Are you Indu's uncle?
Give the line to her.

932
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,230
Well, Mr. Moody? Moods become
all right when with friends.

933
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,700
Hello! How're you brother!

934
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:37,200
Come, Brother Rahul.
...Come on.

935
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,540
(People chatting at distance)

936
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,780
Hello, Uncle Suri!
How are you?

937
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,930
(Tch)

938
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,400
Hello, child!
How were your exams?

939
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,270
They haven't begun as yet.

940
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,960
Hey! Whose cute child is this?

941
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,050
My word! He is so sweet!

942
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,760
Whose son is he?

943
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:54,980
(Birds chirping)

944
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,160
Well, who is he?

945
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,390
He's Brother Rahul. His mother is
dead and his dad has gone away.

946
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,470
(Birds chirping)

947
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,880
Why didn't you come for Chulbul's party?

948
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:21,300
(Indistinct)

949
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,560
- Don't hit the plants!
- Why not?

950
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,080
They belong to my father!
I will break them!

951
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,440
They also have life,
they too will get hurt.

952
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,030
Rubbish! Who says so?

953
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,570
My mother used to say that.

954
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:33,960
- Your mother is dead!
- Don't!

955
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,440
Dad! Dad!

956
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,460
- Here, brother, it's a good one...
- Dad!

957
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,120
Dad, Babbu hit Brother Rahul.

958
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,240
Babbu hit Rahul? Impossible!

959
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,810
I saw Babbu hit him.

960
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,370
Babbu! Babbu!

961
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,210
Come here.

962
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,780
(Birds chirping)

963
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,360
- Did you hit Rahul?
- No, I didn't hit him.

964
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,160
I told you so.
My Babbu never hits anybody.

965
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,180
- He's lying. He hit him.
- All right. Let's go.

966
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,140
Come, son.

967
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,250
- What will you drink?
- Thumps up.

968
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:15,310
(Indistinct)

969
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,360
Rahul, did Babbu hit you?

970
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,600
No, he didn't.

971
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,680
Who will play cricket?
Come on, everyone!

972
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,470
- My turn first!
- Let's toss.

973
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,940
- Give it to him.
- My turn first.

974
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,640
- Kids after the elders.
- No. Elders after the kids.

975
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,980
(Cheering)

976
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,540
- Clean bowled!
- Good bowling!

977
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,180
The kids have finished their
turn. Now it's the elders' turn.

978
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,920
DK, bowl a googly!

979
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,100
(Indistinct)

980
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,920
Watchman! What are you doing?

981
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:56,310
(Indistinct)

982
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,660
Leave me! ...This is cheating!

983
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,910
(Grunts)

984
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:01,300
(Indistinct)

985
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,740
I made it!

986
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:03,710
(Gasps)

987
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,410
Mr. Umpire, your place is here!

988
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,390
(Birds chirping)

989
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,200
- Aunt Kanta! Run!
- Where do I throw it?

990
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,600
Here!

991
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,150
Kanta, here!

992
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,260
(Grunts)

993
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:20,120
- Wow! Good throw, my lioness!
- Naturally!

994
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:22,760
Inswinger, son.

995
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,650
Howzzat!

996
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:26,880
Not out!

997
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,190
- Not out!
- Not out!

998
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,210
- Not out?
- No!

999
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:30,260
Not out!

1000
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,200
You're cheating!

1001
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,580
He's not out. I am the umpire.

1002
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,720
Mummy! Move a little there.
...That's right.

1003
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,560
Watchman! Move behind... Further!

1004
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,240
- Here?
- That's fine!

1005
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,080
A little more.
Yes... That's fine.

1006
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,600
Come, son!
It's only cricket!

1007
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,660
(Indistinct)

1008
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,380
It's my turn to bat!

1009
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,200
Hadn't I told you he'd
grow up to be like Kapil Dev!

1010
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,630
Dad, not out!

1011
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:02,020
(Indistinct)

1012
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,040
(Birds chirping)

1013
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,250
Catch!

1014
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,080
- Aunt, take the catch!
- Go take your run!

1015
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,480
Our fielding isn't tight.

1016
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,840
It's a tough game!

1017
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,510
Mr. Umpire, keep this here.

1018
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,850
Just a minute!

1019
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,120
(Grunts)

1020
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,520
Ah! Come on, Suri!

1021
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,840
Come on!

1022
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,910
Sixer! Sixer!

1023
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,610
(Indistinct)

1024
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,180
Didn't I tell you he'd
become a Gavaskar someday!

1025
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,040
With bowlers like me, he will
surely become a Gavaskar!

1026
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:39,970
Over up!

1027
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,670
- Over up!
- Over up!

1028
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,280
- Come, Rahul. You bowl too.
- No.

1029
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,720
No problem. Play underarm.

1030
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,560
Give it a try, Rahul.

1031
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,640
- He's going to bowl fast!
- You're sacred!

1032
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,520
Come on, my lion!

1033
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,320
Get in there!

1034
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,640
Come on!

1035
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,740
(Indistinct)

1036
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,520
Well, Mr. Lion Suri!!

1037
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,920
Saw how amazing my...

1038
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:29,200
(Background music)

1039
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,450
These crockery and cutlery...

1040
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:42,680
...have been bought from
Harrod's store in London.

1041
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,420
And these idiots levy
a duty of 150% on it.

1042
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,800
I could never tolerate
cheap spoons in college...

1043
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,520
...so I can't possibly
tolerate them now!

1044
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,520
You have a mania for imported items.

1045
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,480
You should have got
an imported wife, too!

1046
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,480
Take some.

1047
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,740
(Sighs)

1048
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:05,000
Wife? Well, you don't get
wives at the Harrod's store.

1049
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,260
Or else, I would have surely got one.

1050
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,920
But once in New York...

1051
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,800
Tell your wife.
Don't hide things from Kanta.

1052
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,600
No. There's nothing to hide.

1053
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:22,520
Trixie came into my life
before Kanta did.

1054
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,200
Trixie? Who's she?

1055
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,000
Trixie means full of tricks.

1056
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,480
Kanta, don't take him seriously.
He loves to tease you.

1057
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,400
There is nothing to tease about.

1058
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:37,810
If I have ever met anyone else
after marrying you, then...

1059
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,240
...have I ever told you about it?

1060
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,410
If there is another woman, then remarry!

1061
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:46,040
He is joking, Kanta. Would he
ever leave you to remarry?

1062
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,340
(Crickets chirping)

1063
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:52,350
One can form relationships,
even without getting married.

1064
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,410
- Indu, what are you saying?
- The truth.

1065
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,080
Indu, you may say
whatever you like about me.

1066
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,620
But there is no need to
speak about DK this way.

1067
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,790
There was a need, so I spoke.

1068
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,320
Meaning?

1069
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,280
You can ask him that!

1070
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,590
Hey! What's wrong
with her? ...Indu!

1071
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,980
(Dog barks at distance)

1072
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,010
What's the matter?

1073
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,080
I've been observing this tension
between you since morning.

1074
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,930
And the way Indu was
talking to that boy Rahul...

1075
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,750
Who is Rahul?

1076
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,120
- He is my son.
- What!

1077
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,000
He is my son

1078
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,350
(Sighs)

1079
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,970
When I went to Nainital in 1973...

1080
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:52,370
(Cheering)

1081
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,720
- No, I won't have.
- You're grown up now!

1082
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,320
- You're going to be a father!
- Get lost!

1083
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,480
Well... but you aren't
even married as yet!

1084
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,200
(Indistinct)

1085
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,070
In the midst of the din, she too
was there... lonely and quiet.

1086
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,120
Her name was Bhavna.
I knew her from my school days.

1087
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,680
She used to be so lively.
But now...

1088
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,700
This girl has been through a big tragedy.

1089
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,920
She lost her family in a car
accident while still in school.

1090
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,680
The master said that Bhavna had
completely withdrawn since then.

1091
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,520
The master knew Bhavna and
her family since a long time...

1092
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:38,430
...so, in a way,
her responsibility fell on him.

1093
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,510
He wanted Bhavna to
somehow overcome her grief.

1094
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,080
Or that someone explain to her.

1095
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,400
DK, show me your hand.

1096
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,690
(Grunts)

1097
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,030
(Grunts)

1098
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,970
This is your marriage line.

1099
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:01,620
How deep and strong it is!

1100
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,600
Indu and you are very happy, aren't you?

1101
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,800
Yes, very much so.

1102
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,960
Look, how strong
it is all throughout. But...

1103
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,190
(Wind blowing noise)

1104
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,210
- But at one point...
- At one point? What?

1105
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:23,280
Never mind. Since you don't
believe in it, forget it.

1106
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,920
But what did you see?

1107
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,010
Nothing. Never mind.

1108
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,930
Tell me one more thing.

1109
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,920
Will we get a baby boy or a baby girl?

1110
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,700
You do have a boy. But I'm
not sure if it will be this time.

1111
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:48,510
I want a son!

1112
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,880
Then you'll surely get a son.

1113
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:53,580
(Deep breath)

1114
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,020
Show me your hand.

1115
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,240
- What will you do looking at it?
- At least show it.

1116
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:58,980
(Laughs)

1117
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,610
Now I'll tell you your future.
...Show me your hand.

1118
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,040
(Sighs)

1119
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,800
Where is your marriage line?

1120
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,960
- Oh yes! ...The left hand.
- It's this one.

1121
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,520
It's incomplete.

1122
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,500
But there is a faint line all along.

1123
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,550
Yes. I can't understand.

1124
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,250
There is a marriage line,
and yet there isn't.

1125
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,920
Let me see.
Where is your life line?

1126
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,550
Here it is.

1127
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,680
This one? It's rather short.

1128
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,720
I know.

1129
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,640
You do?

1130
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,240
I see! That means,
you have decided to die soon!

1131
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,960
I haven't decided that.
...I know it.

1132
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,730
She knows!

1133
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,270
DK: And she is dead.
I can't believe it!

1134
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,830
She had a strange blind belief.

1135
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,480
On meeting Bhavna,
I was surprised to see...

1136
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:06,090
...that a person could bottle up
one's grief for so long.

1137
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,280
As though sorrows had become
the sole purpose of her life.

1138
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:11,550
Suri...

1139
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,320
I was sympathetic towards Bhavna.

1140
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:17,780
And Bhavna needed that.

1141
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,320
It was plain sympathy, which one
can feel towards anybody.

1142
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,800
Nothing more.

1143
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,080
Forget all this, Bhavna.
These things are useless.

1144
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:35,640
Fate and destiny are all rubbish!
Lead the life of a normal girl.

1145
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:38,690
Please don't scold me, DK.

1146
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,100
Please come and sit next to me.

1147
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,560
DK: She asked me to sit next to her,
and I did not refuse.

1148
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:47,980
(wood sound)

1149
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,200
DK: What happened after that...

1150
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,000
I can't explain to anyone.

1151
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,870
I myself don't understand.

1152
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:02,580
Suri!

1153
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,500
Indu and my children...

1154
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,580
(Background music)

1155
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,860
...mean the world to me.

1156
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:18,250
My... My home is
breaking apart, Suri.

1157
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,160
What do I do?

1158
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,120
How do I explain to Indu?

1159
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,000
My home is breaking apart.

1160
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,160
You will have to do one thing.

1161
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,120
You will have to send that boy away.

1162
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,270
I know that.

1163
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,720
But where will I send him?

1164
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,220
To a boarding school.

1165
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:54,610
(Background music)

1166
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,870
He too has a right.

1167
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,270
(Sighs)

1168
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,430
Where will he go?
How is he at fault?

1169
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,200
What has that innocent child done?

1170
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,530
Mummy, I can't solve
these sums. Please help me.

1171
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,560
Winky, don't disturb me.
I can't solve your sums.

1172
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,990
What's the matter with
you these days, mummy?

1173
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,100
Suppose that fatso stands first
in class again, then?

1174
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,780
- May I help you?
- Do you know to solve them?

1175
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,780
Yes, I do.

1176
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,970
Show me.

1177
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,510
Mini!

1178
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,320
Mini, what are you doing!
...How do you know this, Rahul?

1179
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,360
I always stood first in Math.
But I was a bit weak in Hindi.

1180
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,280
Won't you study further?

1181
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,440
Stay back in Delhi.
Study here.

1182
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,800
- Shall I stay here?
- Yes! Stay here.

1183
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,080
I'll have to ask aunty.

1184
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,320
Why ask mummy?
She loves all children.

1185
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,440
Yes! Mummy loves children!

1186
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,640
Me, too?

1187
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,200
Yes! She is a little shy of you.
You're still new.

1188
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,460
Gupta was saying that a lot
remains to be done on the design.

1189
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,770
Yes, sir. That's right.

1190
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,490
We have a presentation at
Mr. Bansal's office within a week.

1191
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,100
He has already called twice.
What's the matter with you?

1192
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:40,980
I'm sorry, sir.

1193
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,950
It's a personal problem.

1194
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,730
Work is work, DK.
Hmm. Okay?

1195
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,330
Okay, sir.

1196
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,490
I'll take this home.
I'll try to finish it there.

1197
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,800
(Door open sound)

1198
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,520
(Foot steps)

1199
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:13,050
(Background music)

1200
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,260
For how long will you
continue to have sleeping pills?

1201
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,900
Till I don't get sleep!

1202
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:59,800
(Background music)

1203
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,930
"Respected Master,
I am absolutely fine here."

1204
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,250
"Is there been
any letter from my father?"

1205
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,410
It should be Has there been
any letter' and not Is there'.

1206
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,840
Okay?

1207
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,450
"Any news about him?
Uncle loves me a lot."

1208
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,890
"There is an aunty too. Even she
loves me but is a little shy."

1209
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,570
"Are you all right?"

1210
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,690
(Birds chirping)

1211
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,680
- Brother Rahul, who's drawn this?
- I have.

1212
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:41,680
- But who are they?
- This is your Dad...

1213
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,760
...your mother,
your sister and you.

1214
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,880
Where is mummy's bun?

1215
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,760
It's behind. You can't see it.

1216
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:52,990
That's right. You can't see it.
But where are you?

1217
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,120
I'm sitting right here.

1218
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:57,300
- Where are you in this picture?
- I'm not here.

1219
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,880
- Shall I draw myself here?
- Please do.

1220
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,280
It's mummy's birthday
the day after tomorrow.

1221
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,170
I forgot to get bangles for her.

1222
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,460
Brother Rahul, what
will you get for mummy?

1223
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,040
RAHUL: Me...

1224

(Paper sound)

1225
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,950
Shall I make a bangle box for aunty?

1226
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:22,430
I've composed a poem.
Shall I recite it?

1227
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,900
Forget it!

1228

01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,560
Happy birthday aunty.

1286
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,830
Thank you.

1287
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,440
Move aside.

1288
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,600
- Let me also do something.
- Quiet! Don't harass us!

1289
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:46,960
Let her do it.

1290
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,760
She won't do a thing. She will
only spoil my handwriting.

1291
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,850
I'll also write.

1292
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,690
Don't write anything.
You don't know anything!

1293
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,960
What are you doing, children?

1294
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:59,280
Please go away!

1295
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,080
Mummy is coming!

1296
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,120
- Please come, mummy.
- What's the matter?

1297
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:09,420
Nothing. Please be seated
and have your breakfast.

1298
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:10,430
(Paper sound)

1299
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,390
- What's this?
- Your birthday present.

1300
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:17,000
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

1301
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:20,410
- What is it?
- Open it and have a look.

1302
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,900
(Sighs)

1303
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,650
- That's beautiful!
- There're bangles in there, too!

1304
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,680
It's lovely!

1305
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,040
- Did you get it, Winky?
- No.

1306
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:31,390
I don't think Mini must
have got it. Who bought it?

1307
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,520
Brother Rahul has personally
made it for your birthday.

1308
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:42,170
Dad, look what
Brother Rahul made for mummy.

1309
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,490
Dad, look what Rahul
made for mummy... Look, Dad.

1310
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:49,930
(Paper sound)

1311
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,250
Very good.

1312
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,600
Have you made this?
It's lovely!

1313
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,540
Didn't aunty like it?

1314
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,500
- Of course, she did.
- She liked it very much.

1315
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,560
Yes! She liked it very much.

1316
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:24,110
(Background music)

1317
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:57,440
(Background music)

1318
01:28:52,210 --> 01:28:53,110
(Sighs)

1319
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,360
- What happened?
- Take your son away!

1320
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,650
(Dog barks at distance)

1321
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,940
Mumma!

1322
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:57,490
(Sobbing)

1323
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,520
Abdul!

1324
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:10,840
- Mummy!

1325
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,640
(Grunts)

1326
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:13,040
(Glass breaking sound)

1327
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,560
I am not your mother!
Don't you dare call me mummy again!

1328
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:29,880
(Background music)

1329
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:34,460
Yuck! I don't like brinjal!

1330
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,880
Stupid! You don't like anything!

1331
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:40,040
You stupid!
You brinjal! You pumpkin!

1332
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,760
- Mummy, tell her.
- Winky, have your dinner quietly.

1333
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,040
Brother Rahul, please
pass me the cauliflower.

1334
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,970
Blood! Dad, Brother Rahul's
hand is bleeding!

1335
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,430
Mummy, look!
Brother Rahul's hand is bleeding!

1336
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,940
What happened?

1337
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:04,510
(Background music)

1338
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,150
What's happened?

1339
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,540
Indu, how did he hurt himself?

1340
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,510
(Vessels sound)

1341
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:19,120
Indu! How did he hurt himself?

1342
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,000
How should I know?
He didn't tell me!

1343
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,440
A child gets hurt at home,
and you aren't even aware!

1344
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,700
Don't scream at me
in front of the children!

1345
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,450
Just because he is not your child?

1346
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,650
Let the one who has sinned
take care of him! Why bother me?

1347
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:41,820
(Background music)

1348
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,540
Indu!

1349
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,210
Aren't you ashamed of speaking so?

1350
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,840
I have not been as shameless
as you! Are you ashamed?

1351
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:52,990
So what should I do?

1352
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,020
Tell me, what should I do?

1353
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,310
Should I kill myself?

1354
01:31:58,870 --> 01:32:02,170
(Background music)

1355
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:04,800
You want to go on leave?
What's wrong with you, DK?

1356
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,310
The other architects have
already sent their proposals!

1357
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:09,500
No, DK. I'm sorry, you cannot go!

1358
01:32:10,450 --> 01:32:12,530
Sir, if I don't get leave,
I will have to resign.

1359
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,080
Resign! Will you will have to resign!
What nonsense you speak!

1360
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,160
This is too much!
A height of negligence!

1361
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,820
You should have informed me
earlier that you can't work!

1362
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,960
Sir, I'd told you earlier
that I have a personal problem!

1363
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:25,300
Even I have a problem!

1364
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:31,390
Look, I have to run the company.
I can't possibly do it alone.

1365
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,420
Tell me what the matter is.

1366
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,480
All right... You may go!

1367
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:49,200
You know your responsibility.
...You may go.

1368
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:55,320
(Background music)

1369
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,200
- Uncle, will you take me boating?
- Sure.

1370
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,840
- What about riding?
- I'll take you riding too.

1371
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,040
- What about China Peak?
- You want to go there?

1372
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:04,650
- Yes.
- Walking?

1373
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:07,910
Yes. That's the master's house.

1374
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,100
Sir!

1375
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,620
Sir?

1376
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:22,930
Sir!

1377
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:24,800
Sir!

1378
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:28,570
Sir...

1379
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:34,830
(Birds chirping)

1380
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,860
Mr. Tiwari?

1381
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:38,560
- When did you come?
- This morning. Good you found us.

1382
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:42,700
We were going to come to school
at 2 p.m. for Rahul's admission.

1383
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,150
- The Principal told me.
- Son, greet him.

1384
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:45,910
Hi.

1385
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:48,180
- How are you, son?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1386
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:49,440
Absolutely fine.

1387
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,430
Where is the master?

1388
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:53,930
(Birds chirping)

1389
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,180
He passed away.

1390
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:59,060
What! When?

1391
01:34:01,830 --> 01:34:05,470
He suffered a heart attack
a few days ago.

1392
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:12,140
(Background music)

1393
01:34:20,630 --> 01:34:24,470
Uncle, do you think my mother
may have lied to me?

1394
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,600
Why?

1395
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:29,820
Maybe, my father isn't alive?

1396
01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:46,030
He'll be here soon.

1397
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:52,350
Please understand,
even I have some problems.

1398
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,640
- I understand...
- No, but...

1399
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:03,540
Mr. Tiwari, will I get admission here?

1400
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:06,150
Yes, son. We are trying.

1401
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,510
(Birds chirping)

1402
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,790
Will I have to stay here then?

1403
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:17,050
Yes. You can stay
in the hostel here.

1404
01:35:18,310 --> 01:35:19,100
Right?

1405
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,930
So, we can send the boy out
to ten days on 27th?

1406
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:24,290
- Thank you very much, father. It's...
- Close the door, please.

1407
01:35:24,330 --> 01:35:25,010
Oh, sorry.

1408
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,980
Where do I get his books?

1409
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:29,990
You'll get the list from office.

1410
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:33,650
- Do I get his uniforms or...
- They will be made here.

1411
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:37,210
Rahul, come here.
Meet your Principal.

1412
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,970
This is the boy.

1413
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:40,800
How will you send him?

1414
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,740
I will be going to Delhi,
so I'll fetch him.

1415
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:45,200
Mr. Tiwari will bring him here.

1416
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:51,090
So now you're going to join our school.

1417
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:55,060
Thank him, son. He has
agreed to give you admission.

1418
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:56,820
Say thank you.

1419
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:02,430
Can I send you a cheque for the fee?

1420
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:03,000
Come.

1421
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:07,300
You can sign the papers after
2 days when the office opens.

1422
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:08,900
All right.

1423
01:36:09,610 --> 01:36:11,200
Okay, brother Burke, thank you...

1424
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:14,740
Send him after ten days.
And do not be late.

1425
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:18,130
I don't like boys who come late.
...Do you understand?

1426
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:22,660
Let's leave, Rahul.
...Thank you, Brother.

1427
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:31,780
Uncle, the string has gone in.

1428
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:37,540
The string has gone in?

1429
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:41,170
Tie it around from outside.

1430
01:36:43,310 --> 01:36:44,110
Come here.

1431
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:46,160
(Crickets chirping)

1432
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:48,010
Oh... shit.

1433
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,380
- Sleep the way it is.
- No. It will fall.

1434
01:36:53,460 --> 01:36:55,740
It won't fall.
Take a blanket to sleep.

1435
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,220
(Gasps)

1436
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:58,900
Go to sleep.

1437
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:03,060
What's the time?

1438
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,580
It's 8:30. Why?

1439
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:10,020
Mini must be in the bathroom
brushing her teeth...

1440
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:12,830
...and Winky must be
banging loudly at the door.

1441
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,800
(Door knocks)

1442
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,140
Hurry up, Mini!

1443
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:16,750
(Door knocks)

1444
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:20,060
Hurry! ...Hurry up, stupid!

1445
01:37:21,170 --> 01:37:23,270
(Indistinct)

1446
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,020
Yuck!

1447
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:27,910
Why is there so much of noise?

1448
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,820
Mummy, tell Mini. She occupies
the bathroom for so long.

1449
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,820
Dirty girl!
Go wash your face.

1450
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:37,340
One more thing... Both of you
can sleep with me tonight.

1451
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,620
Are you afraid of being alone, mummy?

1452
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:45,970
(Gasps)

1453
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,210
(Rahul chuckles)

1454
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,560
Slow down!

1455
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:49,720
(Pants)

1456
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:50,690
(Laughs)

1457
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,370
(Grunts)

1458
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,260
(Gasping)

1459
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:03,170
Uncle, I like you very much.

1460
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,240
- Really?
- Yes.

1461
01:38:05,910 --> 01:38:09,800
Son, even I like you very much.

1462
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,700
When my Dad comes, I won't stay with him.

1463
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:18,020
(Birds chirping)

1464
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,450
- Why not?
- I will stay with you.

1465
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:28,180
(Birds chirping)

1466
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,750
Will I be able to call you Dad then?

1467
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:42,000
"I'm not frustrated with you, my life."

1468
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:49,550
"I'm just surprised.
Oh, just surprised I am."

1469
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:58,600
"With your innocent questions,
I'm tired now."

1470
01:38:59,220 --> 01:39:03,840
"Oh, I'm tired now."

1471
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:10,150
"I'm not frustrated with you, my life."

1472
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:17,150
"I'm just surprised.
Oh, just surprised I am."

1473
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:26,420
"With your innocent questions,
I'm tired now."

1474
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:31,240
"Oh, I'm tired now."

1475
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:57,010
"Never thought that to live.."

1476
01:39:57,050 --> 01:40:00,810
"..I would need to go through pain."

1477
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:10,950
"Never thought that to live.."

1478
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:14,670
"..I would need to go through pain."

1479
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:23,970
"Whenever I smile, there is a debt that
needs to paid for it."

1480
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:29,100
"And I when I smile, I feel.."

1481
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:33,040
"..I carry that debt on my lips."

1482
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:38,680
"I'm not frustrated with you, my life."

1483
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:45,560
"I'm just surprised.
Oh, just surprised I am."

1484
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:19,860
"Life, the trials you threw my way
have taught me relationships anew."

1485
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:33,730
"Life, the trials you threw my way
have taught me relationships anew."

1486
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:43,100
"The comforts of shade I only found
under the bright scorching sun."

1487
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:52,830
Thank you, brother. Thank you very much.

1488
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:55,590
(Cloack sound)

1489
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,540
I don't want to stay in this school!

1490
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,020
Why not?

1491
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,840
I don't like it!

1492
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:08,110
Stay here for a few days
and you will begin to like it.

1493
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:09,840
There are many other children
also who stay here.

1494
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,120
- Can't I stay in Delhi?
- No!

1495
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:15,690
You have to stay here for a while
in the hostel. Understand?

1496
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:18,150
Why can't I stay in your house?

1497
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:23,680
"I'm not frustrated with you, my life."

1498
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:30,720
"I'm just surprised.
Oh, just surprised I am."

1499
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:05,310
"If today, they've swelled up.."

1500
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:09,240
"..droplets will start falling."

1501
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:19,100
"If today, they've swelled up.."

1502
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:23,350
"..droplets will start falling."

1503
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:28,480
"What may come tomorrow for them.."

1504
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:31,940
"..eyes would suffer."

1505
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:37,500
"Don't know when and where I lost it.."

1506
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:41,060
"..one teardrop I had hid and kept."

1507
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:44,280
Very good.

1508
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:47,010
(Crickets chirping)

1509
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:48,090
And who is this?

1510
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:51,940
That's me and my Dad.

1511
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,820
- Does your Dad wear spectacles?
- Yes.

1512
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:03,540
"I'm not frustrated with you, my life."

1513
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:10,710
"I'm just surprised.
Oh, just surprised I am."

1514
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:19,560
"With your innocent questions,
I'm tired now."

1515
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:24,240
"Oh, I'm tired now."

1516
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:28,820
"Oh, I'm tired now."

1517
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:34,260
"Oh, I'm tired now."

1518
01:44:41,630 --> 01:44:43,510
Dad and Brother Rahul are back!

1519
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:45,900
Rahul is back?

1520
01:44:50,030 --> 01:44:51,750
Mummy! Dad is back!

1521
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:03,990
Dad is back!

1522
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:06,950
(Indistinct)

1523
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:08,810
Dad, what have you got for me?

1524
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:10,760
(Indistinct)

1525
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:12,950
- Did you get my badminton racket?
- Yes!

1526
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,860
(Background chattering)

1527
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:21,270
Just a minute. I'll be back.

1528
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:24,250
- Hello Rahul.
- Hello.

1529
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:25,920
Hello Minni.
(Minni giggles)

1530
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:30,400
She was screaming a while ago,
"Brother Rahul is back!"

1531
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:31,750
And now you're not even talking to him.

1532
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:34,420
No, I wasn't screaming.

1533
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:38,880
She's so shy of you now,
but soon she will be after you!

1534
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:39,830
No!

1535
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:44,370
Here it comes on you, Mini!

1536
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,120
Rahul.

1537
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:56,620
- Did you get your admission?
- Yes.

1538
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:00,030
- So you'll go away?
- Yes.

1539
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:18,880
Indu?

1540
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:20,660
(Sighs)

1541
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:22,740
Chanda?

1542
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,440
What happened?

1543
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:36,110
Major and I have once again...

1544
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,340
You've understood what
I am trying to say, right?

1545
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:46,580
Yes.

1546
01:46:46,660 --> 01:46:47,540
(Sighs)

1547
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:50,890
Oh, Indu, this is the
happiest day of my life!

1548
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:52,210
(Gasps)

1549
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:57,190
But you would always say
that you don't need any support.

1550
01:46:57,790 --> 01:46:59,440
That you don't need a family.

1551
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:02,760
And that you are an independent woman.

1552
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,320
I know, Indu. I know.

1553
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:08,830
It would be fine if I were just a woman.

1554
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,780
But I'm a mother too.

1555
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:16,120
When my child held my hand and said...

1556
01:47:16,780 --> 01:47:18,080
"Please come home, mummy"

1557
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:20,190
...I couldn't hold myself back.

1558
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,650
l just couldn't hold myself back, Indu.

1559
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:31,320
Shall I say something, Indu?

1560
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:35,820
A woman has no say when the
motherly feelings in her arise.

1561
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:39,680
(Background music)

1562
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,280
Mummy.

1563
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,550
- Mummy!
- Hey!

1564
01:47:43,710 --> 01:47:46,790
- Hello, aunty.
- Hello.

1565
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:48,390
- You tell her!
- You tell!

1566
01:47:48,410 --> 01:47:51,370
- What happened?
- Sister has stood first in class.

1567
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:53,600
She defeated that fatso!

1568
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:55,340
Very good! Well-done!

1569
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:59,060
If Brother Rahul had not taught
her, it would've been impossible.

1570
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,300
- Who's Rahul?
- Brother Rahul!

1571
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,730
The boy whom I spoke to you about.

1572
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,620
It's good that the kids have
mingled with each other so well.

1573
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,390
Anita just look in that yellow file.

1574
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:25,590
It's not in this either.
They are my personal papers!

1575
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:27,950
They are Rahul's Nainital papers.
Where are they?

1576
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,580
I had told you to keep them
in a personal file!

1577
01:48:30,870 --> 01:48:31,780
So, just look for them!

1578
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:33,240
I have to send them
with Rahul to Nainital.

1579
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:35,710
Look in that drawer, the lower one.

1580
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:39,280
(Typewritter sound)

1581
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:44,860
SECRETARY: Sir, are these the papers?

1582
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:49,590
Yes. Where were they? Can't you
even file them properly?

1583
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:50,730
Thanks.

1584
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:54,030
- Rahul, take care of these.
- All right, uncle.

1585
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:56,040
They are your papers.
Take them home.

1586
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,520
- Are you being naughty?
- No.

1587
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:00,210
Sit in my cabin.

1588
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,080
I'll go meet Mr. Dhawan.

1589
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,900
Hello.

1590
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,490
(Typewriter sound)

1591
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:25,190
Son.

1592
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:29,390
This letter must have fallen
from those papers. Keep it there.

1593
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:32,020
- Whose letter is it?
- To Mr. Malhotra...

1594
01:49:32,230 --> 01:49:34,400
from Gurudayal Singh, Nainital.

1595
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:35,390
Give it to me.

1596
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:44,340
(Background music)

1597
01:49:56,710 --> 01:49:57,670
Oh, I see.

1598
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:58,940
I see.

1599
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:03,190
You wanted a proposal from the
best architect. It had to be good.

1600
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:04,890
I think we'll clinch the deal.

1601
01:50:05,660 --> 01:50:08,120
Yes... All right,
I'll call you tomorrow.

1602
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,840
Fine... after 2-3 days.
Bye, Mr. Bansal. Thank you.

1603
01:50:12,690 --> 01:50:15,790
DK, I think Mr. Bansal has
liked your proposal very much.

1604
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,430
DK I'm certain our conversation with him,

1605
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,160
- that this contract is...
- That's great, sir.

1606
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,240
Now, what we got to ensure is
when the first presentation...

1607
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:23,280
Sir, excuse me. One minute.

1608
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:26,070
Come on.

1609
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,860
Come on!

1610
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:32,880
Don't forget the papers.

1611
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,070
That's... come on!

1612
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,000
Who's this smart boy, DK?

1613
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,000
This is... Rahul, sir.

1614
01:50:50,980 --> 01:50:52,150
Wish him, Rahul.

1615
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:54,170
Wish him.

1616
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:55,320
Hello, son!

1617
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:58,380
- Whose son is he?
- My friend's.

1618
01:50:59,810 --> 01:51:01,880
He's a very cute child.
Where does he study?

1619
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:05,320
He'll be going to a
boarding school in Nainital.

1620
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:13,280
(Crickets chirping)

1621
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:26,680
(Wood sound)

1622
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:49,920
(Smashing sound)

1623
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:51,440
(Dog barks at distance)

1624
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:52,400
(Whistles)

1625
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,920
(Whistles)

1626
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:06,170
(Background music)

1627
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:30,710
DK!

1628
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:33,390
Rahul is not at home!

1629
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:36,470
- What!
- I searched everywhere.

1630
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:38,530
And the front door was open.

1631
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:48,490
Rahul!

1632
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:50,510
Rahul!

1633
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:52,440
Rahul!

1634
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,020
- Rahul!
- Rahul!

1635
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,280
Mummy!

1636
01:52:58,950 --> 01:52:59,820
Rahul!

1637
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:01,060
Mummy!

1638
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:04,860
Rahul!

1639
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,480
Mummy! Mummy!

1640
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,920
Dad!

1641
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:11,950
Stay with the children.
I'll take a look outside.

1642
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:19,070
What happened, mummy?
Where is Rahul?

1643
01:53:19,110 --> 01:53:19,550
(Gasping)

1644
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:21,720
- It's nothing.
- Why was Dad shouting his name?

1645
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,460
(Sobbing)

1646
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,290
(Indistinct)

1647
01:53:26,130 --> 01:53:27,510
Mummy.

1648
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:28,780
It's okay. It's okay.

1649
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:31,060
Rahul!

1650
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:54,630
- Watchman, did any child pass by?
- No.

1651
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:56,590
- Light skinned with blue eyes?
- No, sir.

1652
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,980
(Background music)

1653
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:02,410
Rahul.

1654
01:54:04,820 --> 01:54:05,830
Rahul.

1655
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:17,190
What happened?

1656
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:20,350
He's nowhere to be seen.
Call the police, I'll take the car.

1657
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:26,370
DK: Wait, Indu...
Don't call the police.

1658
01:54:27,010 --> 01:54:28,840
Give the phone here.
I'll call Suri.

1659
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:32,940
(Dialing sound)

1660
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:42,910
Come on!

1661
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:44,880
Come on!

1662
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,490
MALE: - Hello?
- Come on, come on!

1663
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:52,090
- Please call Mr. Suri.
MALE: - He's sleeping.

1664
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:53,950
I know that, but wake him up.

1665
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,790
MALE: - Who's calling?
- I'm DK Malhotra.

1666
01:54:55,810 --> 01:54:58,530
- Call Mr. Suri. It's urgent.
MALE: - But he is sleeping.

1667
01:54:58,570 --> 01:55:00,320
I know he's sleeping!
I say, wake him up!

1668
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:06,500
Indu, ask Suri to stay ready.
I'll pick him up.

1669
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:17,040
(Tyre screech)

1670
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:19,230
Come on, come on, Suri. Hurry up.

1671
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:22,260
Okay. Let's go.

1672
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,840
- ...DK!
- Rahul!

1673
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:45,160
There he is!

1674
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:46,510
Rahul! There.

1675
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:48,660
Rahul!

1676
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:52,330
(Foot steps)

1677
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:59,890
Rahul, where are you running?

1678
01:56:00,530 --> 01:56:01,530
Wait, Rahul!

1679
01:56:09,190 --> 01:56:10,390
Suri, it's not him.

1680
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:14,020
Damn!

1681
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:17,570
Where the hell is he?
Where could he have disappeared?

1682
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:20,130
- Where do I look for him?
- Come on, now!

1683
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:24,290
What's the use of looking for
him here? It wasn't that boy.

1684
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:27,500
- What do I do?
- Let's go to the police station.

1685
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:31,230
So how are you?
How is everything else?

1686
01:56:33,470 --> 01:56:36,590
I'd called you the other day
but you didn't come.

1687
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,880
Yes.

1688
01:56:39,350 --> 01:56:43,240
Well, I don't get the time... Bye.

1689
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:46,870
(Sighs)

1690
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:48,910
(Indistinct)

1691
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:50,510
Could you please hurry?

1692
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:53,010
(Indistinct)

1693
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:56,320
Ramu, take him inside.

1694
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:58,270
Father's name?

1695
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,400
Father's name!

1696
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,550
Come on.

1697
01:57:01,730 --> 01:57:03,730
What will you do with the father's name?

1698
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:07,620
You have the child's name
and his entire description.

1699
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:09,580
On finding him, will you
ask him his father's name?

1700
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:10,680
Father's name?

1701
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:14,340
(Stammers)

1702
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,430
D.K. Malhotra.

1703
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:16,570
Louder.

1704
01:57:16,610 --> 01:57:21,010
DK Malhotra! Can't you hear?
DK Malhotra!

1705
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:22,800
Calm down.

1706
01:57:25,150 --> 01:57:29,900
DK, any news? Did you find him?
Where are you calling from?

1707
01:57:30,130 --> 01:57:33,020
I'm calling from a petrol pump
near the police station.

1708
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:37,200
We have filed a report at the
police station. But of no avail.

1709
01:57:38,680 --> 01:57:42,410
There's no news of him.
I wonder what's happened to him.

1710
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:43,940
(Sobbing)

1711
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:45,850
DK?

1712
01:57:46,930 --> 01:57:47,690
DK.

1713
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,800
Come home.

1714
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:54,210
It's no use sitting there.

1715
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:00,490
(Background music)

1716
01:58:00,530 --> 01:58:01,690
What is she saying?

1717
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:07,950
Excuse me!
Any news of the boy?

1718
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:09,740
None, yet.

1719
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:14,060
Of what use is such a big unit?
Can't you find even a child?

1720
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:15,560
What are you here for?

1721
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:17,670
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1722
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:19,550
You can't even find a...!

1723
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:20,700
Come on!

1724
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,120
(Door bell)

1725
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:40,250
We found this boy.
Is he yours?

1726
01:58:43,340 --> 01:58:45,580
We found this letter in his pocket.

1727
01:58:45,620 --> 01:58:49,250
He refused to say where he lives.
This letter had your address.

1728
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:52,220
Please sign here.

1729
01:58:54,450 --> 01:58:57,930
(Background music)

1730
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,800
Where did you go?

1731
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:06,950
I asked, where did you go?

1732
01:59:14,980 --> 01:59:17,480
I am asking you something!
Where did you go?

1733
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:24,990
Aren't you ashamed? You are
a guest at somebody's house!

1734
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:26,700
We're doing so much for you!

1735
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:29,780
Instead of being grateful,
this is what you do!

1736
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:34,130
Now, what's the use of standing
in front of me like a statue?

1737
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,180
You don't even have
the courtesy to apologise!

1738
01:59:38,290 --> 01:59:41,180
I am glad you're leaving!
We'll be rid of you!

1739
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:45,070
There has been no peace in the
house ever since you've come!

1740
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:47,560
Do you know how worried
Mini and Winky have been for you?

1741
01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:49,580
Mini hasn't stopped crying!

1742
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,830
And I've been in and around
the house looking for you!

1743
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:56,880
What would we have done
if you were harmed in any way?

1744
01:59:59,030 --> 02:00:02,350
Does one walk out
at midnight in this city!

1745
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:04,940
They kidnap small children!

1746
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:07,690
The entire police force of the city
is in search of you!

1747
02:00:08,700 --> 02:00:10,830
If something were to happen
to you, your father and me...

1748
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:15,300
I mean, your uncle and I...

1749
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:18,870
- I know.
- What do you know?

1750
02:00:19,980 --> 02:00:23,770
That he's my Dad.
It is written in the letter.

1751
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:33,110
(Background music)

1752
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:04,190
Rahul?

1753
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,050
(Sobbing)

1754
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,070
DK, wait.

1755
02:01:09,740 --> 02:01:10,440
Just a minute.

1756
02:01:21,310 --> 02:01:23,560
- He knows.
- What?

1757
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:29,080
About your relationship with him.

1758
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:32,900
How?

1759
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:37,560
He had this with him.

1760
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:42,840
Go to him.

1761
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:08,260
(Background music)

1762
02:02:14,290 --> 02:02:15,840
(Sobbing)

1763
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:18,770
Rahul...

1764
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,880
Rahul!

1765
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:40,380
Listen.

1766
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:47,300
Son, you shouldn't do this.
Where did you go?

1767
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,980
Uncle Suri and I
looked for you everywhere.

1768
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:07,600
Rahul!

1769
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:10,270
Are you angry with me?

1770
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,610
What happened?

1771
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,080
Nothing.

1772
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:30,580
What does he say?

1773
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:35,390
- Hmm? What?
- Doesn't talk...

1774
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:36,290
He isn't saying a word.

1775
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:39,300
I can understand.

1776
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:44,190
I just can't.

1777
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:46,190
I can understand.

1778
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:56,630
Imagine a child who is trying to
trace his father since years...

1779
02:03:56,690 --> 02:03:59,020
...and when he finally
does find him...

1780
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:01,530
...his father does not accept him.

1781
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:06,900
He keeps him apart
and sends him far away.

1782
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:14,690
You can imagine what that
child must be going through.

1783
02:04:17,230 --> 02:04:19,660
Sorry about saying all this.

1784
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:20,220
Good night.

1785
02:04:20,260 --> 02:04:21,270
(Foot steps)

1786
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:23,860
Let's go to sleep.

1787
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:29,620
Carry on. I'll come later.

1788
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:50,790
Indu, drop the children to school
by taxi in the morning.

1789
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:53,640
I'll take Rahul to the station.

1790
02:05:02,170 --> 02:05:10,600
"Life, the trials you threw my way
have taught me relationships anew."

1791
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:24,670
"Life, the trials you threw my way
have taught me relationships anew."

1792
02:05:25,730 --> 02:05:34,010
"The comforts of shade I only found
under the bright scorching sun."

1793
02:05:44,570 --> 02:05:57,420
"I am not angry with you, Life.
Simply baffled."

1794
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:11,170
Sorry, aunty.

1795
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:26,090
"Today my eyes have
welled up with tears."

1796
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:36,500
"Today my eyes have welled up
with tears."

1797
02:06:36,710 --> 02:06:40,550
"Soon they will burst forth, I'm sure."

1798
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:46,000
"Tomorrow, who knows,
these sore eyes perhaps."

1799
02:06:46,100 --> 02:06:49,590
"Will long for the sight of more."

1800
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:55,070
"Where have I lost that
lone drop of tears."

1801
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,810
"Which I had tucked away so safely?"

1802
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:11,530
"I am not angry with you, Life
Simply baffled."

1803
02:07:14,690 --> 02:07:16,400
(Birds chirping)

1804
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:18,900
- Bye-bye, Rahul.
- Bye-bye.

1805
02:07:24,550 --> 02:07:25,550
Come on, Mini.

1806
02:07:26,890 --> 02:07:29,210
Come, Mini.
We are getting late.

1807
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:44,580
(Background music)

1808
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:52,730
(Car door opens)

1809
02:07:53,870 --> 02:07:55,280
(Car door shuts)

1810
02:08:12,450 --> 02:08:14,850
Mummy, why had Rahul run away?

1811
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:16,140
I don't know.

1812
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:22,180
Won't he ever return now?

1813
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:24,270
I don't know.

1814
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:27,990
- Whom will he stay with?
- With his Dad.

1815
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:31,440
But he doesn't have a Dad.

1816
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:36,190
He does. He had drawn his Dad's
picture and showed it to me.

1817
02:08:36,230 --> 02:08:37,290
(Papers sound)

1818
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:39,780
(Grunts)

1819
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:42,340
Hey, this is Rahul's sketch book.

1820
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,480
Yes. He gave it to me.

1821
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:50,110
This is mummy, me, you,
Dad and Brother Rahul.

1822
02:08:50,650 --> 02:08:53,520
This is Brother Rahul and his Dad.

1823
02:08:56,510 --> 02:09:01,340
(Background music)

1824
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:09,390
Did you strike off Rahul's picture?

1825
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:10,560
No.

1826
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:19,080
(Background music)

1827
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:01,460
Abdul!

1828
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:05,450
- Where is sir?
- He's taken Rahul to the station.

1829
02:10:05,790 --> 02:10:09,230
(Station announcements)

1830
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:16,330
Mr. Tiwari! Here.

1831
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:17,630
DK sir!

1832
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:19,680
- How are you?
- Let's go, Rahul.

1833
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:20,920
The train is about to leave.

1834
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,480
- I'll carry it.
- No, allow me.

1835
02:10:24,730 --> 02:10:26,370
- How are you, Rahul?
- This way, Mr. Tiwari.

1836
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:29,960
(People chattering indistinctly)

1837
02:10:30,030 --> 02:10:32,670
The seat numbers are 55 and 56.

1838
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,480

(People chattering indistinctly)

1841
02:10:52,820 --> 02:10:55,050
Come on, Rahul.
The train is about to leave.

1842
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:38,590
Will you come to meet me?

1843
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:45,870
Yes, son. I will surely come.
Whenever you say so.

1844
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:49,620
You won't forget me again, will you?

1845
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:53,080
No, son. I will never forget you.
...Not this time.

1846
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:56,950
You won't forget me, will you?

1847
02:11:57,880 --> 02:12:02,280
How can I forget you?
After all, you are my Dad.

1848
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:07,140
Yes... Yes, son. I'm your Dad.

1849
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:11,510
I am your Dad.

1850
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:17,660
Rahul...

1851
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:21,270
I'm sorry.

1852
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:25,960
(Sobbing)

1853
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:35,240
Come on, Rahul, hurry up.
The train is about to leave.

1854
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,280
Write to me once you get there.

1855
02:12:44,220 --> 02:12:46,660
- Mr. Tiwari...
- I've made all the arrangements.

1856
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:48,290
- Are you sure?
- I've taken care of everything.

1857
02:12:49,590 --> 02:12:52,430
- What about the food?
- I'll arrange it in the train.

1858
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:54,750
Don't let him have water from outside.

1859
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,240
- Have you kept his water bottle?
- It must be with him.

1860
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:59,360
- Son, where is your bottle?
- It's in the car.

1861
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:02,670
- I'll go get it.
- But the train is about to leave!

1862
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:05,200
Mr. DK, please! The train
is about to leave. Mr. DK!

1863
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,300
Excuse me! Ticket!

1864
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,130
Sorry.

1865
02:13:20,590 --> 02:13:22,350
I'll be back in a moment.
I have to get something.

1866
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:24,280
- Fine, but where's your ticket?
- I have it.

1867
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,320
But where?

1868
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:29,390
My child is in the train. I have
to get his bottle. I'll be back.

1869
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:32,300
- Come this side.
- I repeat, I do have the ticket!

1870
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:33,760
I say, stand aside!

1871

Whose car is this?

1874
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:56,200
- Whose car is this?
- That's the person, sir.

1875
02:13:57,340 --> 02:13:58,380
Aye!

1876
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,960
Move your car! Is this how
you park? I can't open my car!

1877
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:08,700
- Hurry up!
- I'm moving it away.

1878
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:10,460

(Traffic noices)

1882
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:52,240

(Indistinct)

1888
02:16:25,950 --> 02:16:27,310
Now, will you keep sitting here...

1889
02:16:29,570 --> 02:16:30,730
...or come home?
