1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,440
<span style="style.center_1">Far from human habitat,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">deep in the jungle, amid animals</span>

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,800
<span style="style.center_1">live seven brothers.</span>

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,000
<span style="style.center_1">This could be the reason</span>
<span style="style.center_1">for their animalistic demeanor.</span>

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,440
<span style="style.center_1">Here, headbutts are used to express</span>
<span style="style.center_1">happiness, and punches, to express love.</span>

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,240
Wake up!
These rascals plan to sleep all day.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,240
Get up!

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,120
I'll count to three and
if you aren't up,

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,400
I will force... every single one of you...

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,000
to take a shower!

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
Alright.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,640
One!

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,040
Two!

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
-No!
-We're up!

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,760
Open your eyes and look at me.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,400
And listen carefully.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,640
Som, you'll milk the cow today.

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,240
-What if she refuses to yield?
-I'll milk you!

18
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,400
-Chop the wood and load the warehouse.
-The axe is blunt.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
Use a razor then.

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
Yes, Budh.

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,160
Clean the stables and the chicken coop.

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,440
Why? I love the scent
of cow dung in the morning.

23
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,440
Sniff your clothes
if you miss the scent.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,680
-Irrigate the field.
-What's the point?

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,520
We can eat at the hotel
and be happy.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,440
I'll beat the hell out of you!
Just follow my instructions.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Yes?

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
You'll cook... but first do the dishes.

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,880
Why would I touch the water?

30
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,840
Because if you don't,
I'll drown you in it.

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,800
Cut the grass and store
it in the backyard.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
Why should I do that?
Let the grass grow.

33
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
The cattle can graze in the field itself.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,240
Grains grow in the field as well.
Why do we cook it?

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
Why don't we eat it
directly in the field?

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,160
Go!

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,120
This is unfair.
You order us around every day.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,600
"Milk the hens...

39
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Chop the horse's wood
and clean the stable of the field."

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,480
And all you do is sit comfortably
in your chair and watch us!

41
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm your elder brother.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,640
An elder brother is like a father
and the sons must obey their father!

43
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,160
Does fatherhood prohibit a father
from helping his children out?

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,200
What is fatherhood?

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,720
It's similar to motherhood!

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Tell me, does it stop you?

47
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Yes, it does.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
Of course it does.

49
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
Because I'm your commander.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,440
The commander plans the war.
He doesn't fight the battle himself.

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,280
Fine, each one of us should
get a chance to be the commander!

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Right, brothers?

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,360
-That's right!
-Just a minute...

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,960
Who wants to be what?

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,320
Each of us wants to
be the commander for a day.

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
All those who wish to be the
commander, step forward.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
Stand in line.

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,400
-So, you want to be the commander?
-Yes!

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,760
-What if I don't let you?
-We'll protest!

60
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
We'll raise our voice against injustice!

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,960
-Fulfill our demands!
-Fulfill our demands!

62
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,040
Now tell me, what is your response?

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,240
-You want an answer?
-Yes.

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,280
It's pretty simple.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
One for all, all for one!

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
Go ahead.

67
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
These rascals wish to be the commander!

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Lunch is ready!

69
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,760
Brother isn't here yet.
You'll get us all beaten up.

70
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,880
-I'm hungry!
-Get lost!

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,600
Are you alright?

72
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,240
I mean, is this all you'll eat?

73
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
This is for you guys.

74
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,520
I'll starve to death!

75
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,320
Fire!

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,600
Fire!

77
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,440
We must teach Shani a lesson!

78
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
We always forgive him
because he's the youngest!

79
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes.

80
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,640
He fools us every day.
Sometimes he faints...

81
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,040
At times, he fakes
a stomachache.

82
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,240
He fakes fever with
an onion under his arm.

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,240
-What will you do?
-You tell us.

84
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,120
What are you mumbling?

85
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,760
We have such a heavy head.
It must contain a small brain!

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,480
-Think!
-Brother, thinking is not our cup of tea.

87
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,080
-Try...
-I can't.

88
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,680
I got it! Come here.

89
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,520
Bravo! Bravo!

90
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,480
He's coming.

91
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,320
<span style="style.center_1">The flame has ignited, my heart beats</span>

92
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,440
I can't believe Ravi would
give us such a great opportunity.

93
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,560
Why won't he?
We're his younger brothers after all.

94
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,760
We may look different
but our hearts are one.

95
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,280
Yes, you are right.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120
-What is the matter?
-I'll tell you.

97
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,280
Ravi has placed a bet.
The one who wins it...

98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,480
He gets a break of seven days.

99
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,360
He'll get milk and cream
every hour and sweet fruits...

100
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,080
He gets to hog all day.

101
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,440
-Yes, eat to your heart's content.
-What's the bet?

102
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,840
-Very simple, tame an ordinary horse.
-Milk and cream.

103
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,520
That's it? Which horse?

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
Hope you don't mean
that white wild horse?

105
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,440
-Yes...
-Yes, that's the one.

106
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,280
But Ravi has prohibited
us from going near him.

107
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
He has asked us to stay away from
him until he is fully trained.

108
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,360
-He can break our bones!
-If I could get a week off...

109
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,680
I'd never get out of bed.

110
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
I'd neither wash my face nor
rinse my mouth or change clothes.

111
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
I'd eat there...

112
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,560
drink there, and I'd...

113
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
do everything right there.

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
I'd dream, get up and eat...

115
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,000
Go back to sleep, dream again
get up, eat and go back to bed.

116
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,880
But how can we get
a break for seven days?

117
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,840
How?

118
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,280
-It's my fault.
-I tricked him...

119
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm to be blamed.

120
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,360
Get a wet cloth.

121
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Open your eyes, my boy.

122
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,560
Who did this?

123
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
Who asked Shani to ride Raja?

124
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,240
Answer me!

125
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,240
Listen to me carefully.
If anything happens to my Shani...

126
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,040
I won't spare you!

127
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,040
If you hate your little brother
so much, I'll take him and leave!

128
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
You may keep this house,
farm, field! I want nothing!

129
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,800
I'll only take my Shani and leave.

130
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,960
Son... open your eyes.

131
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,160
-This...
-I'm absolutely fine.

132
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,360
Nothing is wrong with me.

133
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,360
Your little brother won't
die even if an elephant crushes him.

134
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,960
The horse is nothing.

135
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,160
Then why did you get us slammed?

136
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,600
Forgive me.
Actually, I was testing Ravi.

137
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,040
I was just checking the love he has
for us in his tender heart,

138
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,720
hidden beneath his tough exterior.

139
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,280
There is love. Loads of it.

140
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,840
But Ravi doesn't love us.

141
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,480
Yes, I don't love you.
Go die under the horse's foot...

142
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,480
then you'll see how much I love you.

143
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Come here...

144
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
My sturdy brother cries like a girl.

145
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,080
Don't ever say you'll leave us.

146
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,240
You won't go? Right?

147
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,640
Where can I go?

148
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,320
Can the body leave the soul?

149
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
You are my soul.

150
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:49,440
<span style="style.center_1">We'll lead our lives together...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Singing our hearts out</span>

151
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:57,600
<span style="style.center_1">We're the colors of a rainbow</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That brighten up the world</span>

152
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:05,480
<span style="style.center_1">We'll lead our lives together...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Singing our hearts out</span>

153
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:13,640
<span style="style.center_1">We're the colors of a rainbow</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That brighten up the world</span>

154
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,160
<span style="style.center_1">We're the base of melody</span>

155
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,080
<span style="style.center_1">The verses are sung about us</span>

156
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,800
<span style="style.center_1">The sky sways</span>

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,920
<span style="style.center_1">We are the seven wonders of the world</span>

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,760
<span style="style.center_1">The world exists for us</span>

159
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,440
<span style="style.center_1">We're the base of melody</span>

160
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,720
<span style="style.center_1">The verses are sung about us</span>

161
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,040
<span style="style.center_1">The sky sways</span>

162
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,240
<span style="style.center_1">We are the seven wonders of the world</span>

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,680
<span style="style.center_1">The world exists for us</span>

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:24,360
<span style="style.center_1">We'll lead our lives together...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Singing our hearts out</span>

165
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:32,400
<span style="style.center_1">We're the colors of a rainbow</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That brighten up the world</span>

166

<span style="style.center_1">We share joy</span>

167
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,520
<span style="style.center_1">We share our sorrows</span>

168
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,760
<span style="style.center_1">Why would tears blind us?</span>

169
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:16,480
<span style="style.center_1">We'll go on with each other's support</span>

170
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,320
<span style="style.center_1">We share joy</span>

171
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,360
<span style="style.center_1">We share our sorrows</span>

172
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,360
<span style="style.center_1">Why would tears blind us?</span>

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,920
<span style="style.center_1">We'll go on with each other's support</span>

<span style="style.center_1">Singing our hearts out</span>

175

<span style="style.center_1">That brighten up the world</span>

<span style="style.center_1">Singing our hearts out</span>

<span style="style.center_1">That brighten up the world</span>

178
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,960
-Hello...
-Good day to you Ravi.

179
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,200
10 tins of kerosene, 1 sack of sugar,
5 kg tea, 2 tins butter...

180
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,200
Ravi, one minute.

181
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
By the time you get your stuff packed...

182
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,800
-may we go for a ride?
-Okay.

183
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Listen... no liquor, right?

184
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,280
-Not at all. We're going to have milk.
-Okay.

185
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,160
Come on!

186
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,640
Where was I...?
Yes, 10 kg of salt, 2 of red chili...

187
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,440
1 kg of coriander,
1 kg of cumin, 1/2 kg of bleak pepper...

188
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,320
Bleak pepper?
What's bleak pepper?

189
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,080
Go to the milk bar next door
and get 2 bottles of milk. Take it.

190
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,560
Milk?

191
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,360
-But sir...
-No...

192
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,200
When we go there,
we'll ask for your stuff.

193
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,520
Get 2 bottles of milk.

194
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,240
Need nipples?

195
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,720
Did you say something?

196
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,960
I said if kids ask for milk
in a bottle, give them a nipple.

197
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,960
Because either they don't have
teeth or the teeth won't stay.

198
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,600
Let it be.

199
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,720
They're kids.

200
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,800
Forget it or we'll
be cremated right here.

201
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,120
They are six and we're two.

202
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,080
No!

203
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,240
Not two, there's three of us.

204
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,760
One, two and three.

205
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,720
The 7-foot fellow has here!

206
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,640
Now turn into lions, you rats.

207
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
Grass eating lions.

208
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,640
No, milk suckling calves!

209
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,640
The bull...

210
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,920
The bull doesn't care about
the whimpering of small fry.

211
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,440
They have to clear the path for the bull.

212
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,840
But you look more like a
buffoon than a bull.

213
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,120
Buffoon.

214
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,320
-What do I look like?
-Buffoon!

215
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,960
-Whom did I ask?
-Him.

216
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,600
I asked him. You shut up.

217
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,800
-So, what do I look like?
-Baf--

218
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
They were calling a bull, a buffoon.
They see no difference between the two.

219
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,920
A bull is a bull while
a buffoon is a buffoon.

220
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,960
A bull is a bull whereas
a buffoon is a buffoon.

221
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,920
-Mr. Bull, would you like some milk?
-Yes.

222
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,240
Open it.

223
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,600
Open it, fast.

224
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,000
What are you doing?

225
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,760
Leave me.

226
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,280
Ravi! Help!

227
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,600
Get some milk, Shani.

228
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,240
Scoundrel! I'll...!

229
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,360
Ravi... Milk!

230
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,320
-You drink it.
-Who can win against sorrows?

231
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
What did you say?

232
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,920
Who can win against me?

233
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,680
Not against me...

234
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,320
Shekhar?
What have you done to yourself?

235
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,960
-What is this, what's wrong?
-There's this girl I love...

236
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,840
with all my heart.
But she doesn't.

237
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,840
-Who?
-The one I pledged my life, my faith to.

238
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
But what happened? Where did she go?

239
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,640
No clue.
I have only loved two things in my life.

240
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,920
One the girl, and the other was my job.

241
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,120
-I've lost both.
-You can always get a new job

242
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,880
but you want the same girl, right?

243
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,200
Give me her name and address.
Let me handle it.

244
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,360
What the... who are you?

245
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Later. First tell me
who do you think you are?

246
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,640
What?

247
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,320
What do you think of yourself?

248
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,760
Have you descended from the sky?

249
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,800
Are you the daughter of an emperor?
A princess?

250
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,320
Why are you so arrogant? Just because
you're blessed with a pretty face?

251
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
What right do you have
to play with a man's life?

252
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,040
I'm asking you.

253
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,200
-<span style="style.center_1">He's must be crazy...</span>
-The poor guy is a gentleman.

254
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,560
If it was me, I'd have wrung your
neck like a chicken and dumped you!

255
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,880
-Who are you talking about?
-You made him an alcoholic!

256
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,920
The one who is drinking
his life away because of you.

257
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,920
I'm referring to my childhood
friend, Shekhar! Who else?

258
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,760
Yes! Go and see how he has
tortured himself!

259
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,280
Beggars give him alms when
they pass him on the streets!

260
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,920
Each time he'd meet me he'd say,
Sheela is my life.

261
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,720
Sheela has changed my entire life.

262
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,280
Sheela this and Sheela that!
And you cheat! Haughty woman!

263
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
You left him because he lost his job!

264
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,360
What are you glaring at?
Do you have an answer?

265
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,800
-You want an answer?
-Yes!

266
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,960
Now listen to me. If you say a word,
I'll throw the bed, chair...

267
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,720
and disfigure your face!
Firstly, I'm not Sheela!

268
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,040
Secondly, my name is Indu!
Understood?

269
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,880
I overheard everything.

270
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,320
I have realized my mistake. I'd like
to meet Shekhar and apologize.

271
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,960
-Where is he?
-Sorry...

272
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,080
He's drinking bar on
the hill at Alcohol Road.

273
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,120
What?

274
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,200
I mean he's drinking
alcohol in a bar at Hill Road.

275
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,520
Excuse me...

276
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,600
this friend of yours who just went...
Where's her room? I'd like to meet her.

277
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,280
-Even after that hard slap?
-Because of that hard slap!

278
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,960
The last room in this corridor, it's
hers.

279
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,840
Okay.

280
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
Thanks.

281
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,440
What is it?
Watermelon? Who sent it?

282
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,160
There's a tall man standing down.
He sent it for you.

283
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,520
-He also sent a letter.
-You may go.

284
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,280
This time I want to meet
you for my sake, not Shekhar's.

285
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,240
Please accept this small
token of our friendship.

286
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,360
Hello... I've come...

287
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,880
Is this the first gift you give a girl?
A watermelon?

288
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,400
What's wrong? Melons are healthy.

289
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,600
Strength won't help you
in winning her over.

290
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,440
Send her flowers.

291
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,160
-What?
-Flowers...

292
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,520
Flowers.

293
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,720
Watchman!

294
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,600
-Yes, madam?
-If I see this fool here once more...

295
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,600
-you'll lose your job! Understood?
-Yes.

296
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,560
Did you hear that?

297
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,000
Get out. Have you seen my staff?

298
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,200
Quiet! Repeat what
you said down there.

299
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,280
I was kidding. Put me down.
I'll lose my job if anyone sees me.

300
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,360
The flowers didn't work.

301
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,160
I must think of something else...

302
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,840
So, the patient is your brother?

303
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,120
-Yes, my elder brother.
-What's his problem?

304
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,680
He has many problems, sister.

305
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,600
First it was only his
heart that was affected.

306
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,520
-Now his whole body is affected.
-What do you mean?

307
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,120
I mean...

308
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,880
he fell in love and kept
his heart at the girl's feet.

309
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
But the girl kicked it
away like it was a football!

310
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,960
The innocent man's heart was smashed.

311
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,280
In the heat of the moment,
he tried to kill himself!

312
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,680
He jumped... from a high mountain!

313
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
What? What happened next?

314
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,280
Thank God, he's alive.

315
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,560
Did this affect the girl?

316
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,760
That's what we want to know.
Would it affect you?

317
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,120
Of course. I'm a human
I'd appreciate the person...

318
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,200
I'd have accepted his love
and apologized to him.

319
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Ravi's job is done.

320
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,720
She's here! Go to your rooms
and don't come out till I say so!

321
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,160
Why should we go to the room,
if a girl is coming over?

322
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,440
It's a girl, not the military!

323
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,160
-Who is the girl?
-Yes.

324
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,720
Quiet! Get inside or be thrashed.

325
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
Wait.

326
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,640
Nobody will step out of their rooms.

327
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,880
-Okay.
-No.

328
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,560
Nobody, nobody will make a sound.

329
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,640
-Not a sound. Okay?
-Yes!

330
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,880
We'll shove a silencer down our throats.

331
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,880
-Your house is beautiful.
-You can't see it from here.

332
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,920
You should see our backyard, we have
such lovely trees and gardens...

333
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,840
-You'll be amazed at the flowers.
-Really?

334
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,720
Come.

335
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,280
-Now let's go.
-Son of a gun!

336
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,600
-Is she here for a guided tour?
-Even the cauliflower...

337
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh my God!

338
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,200
-What was that?
-Your brother is in pain.

339
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,320
-Yes.
-Let's see him first.

340
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,240
Okay. Let's go.

341
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,680
-Please help me!
-Come in.

342
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,240
Oh my God!

343
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,440
Are you in a lot of pain?

344
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,360
My treatment will help you with the pain.

345
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,000
You'll should be able to move around soon.

346
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,000
-What's this?
-He's in a lot of pain.

347
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,640
If anyone touches him,
he trembles from head to toe.

348
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,240
Don't worry. I'll help him with it.

349
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,240
You're a man and you've
let a girl do this to you!

350
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,040
-What's he saying?
-He says...

351
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,600
If I don't get that girl,

352
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,600
I'll cut myself into tiny
pieces and throw at her feet.

353
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,240
How will that help?

354
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,760
What good is ruining
your life for another?

355
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,600
The real deal is, when you live
and she lives with your love.

356
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,440
-What is he saying?
-My brother says...

357
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,240
Thank you, but why are you
empathizing with a poor guy like me?

358
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,880
Why not? I am a human, too.

359
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,480
I have a heart and I know
what he must be feeling.

360
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,080
Can your heart really
understand what my heart says?

361
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,920
-You!
-Yes, I've gone completely mad!

362
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,880
I don't know what's happening.
I can't sleep...

363
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,920
like an owl, I stay up nights.

364
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,520
I sleep in the day
and see you everywhere!

365
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,040
In the doors, windows, pot...

366
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,760
I see you in the bread too.

367
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,240
That day, it wasn't just a melon,
I gave you my heart.

368
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,120
Cheat! Fake! Fraud!

369
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,400
You used suicide and this dramatic
brother of yours to get me here!

370
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,560
Do I look dramatic?

371
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,080
Quiet! What do you think?

372
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,360
I'd sympathize with you
on hearing about suicide?

373
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,760
I'd start liking you!

374
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,640
You can jump off from the sky
instead of mountain and die...

375
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,400
It won't affect me at all!

376
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,040
You're treating me like trash.

377
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,320
Trash! Trash is better than you!

378
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,720
Take a look at yourself
if you have a mirror at home!

379
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,920
If you don't, I'll lend you some money
to buy a mirror to look into!

380
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,120
Your face will scare you!

381
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,280
Filthy! Smelly!
Haven't showered for months!

382
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,080
I get scared as soon as you come close.
It is like if you've come from a stable!

383
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,080
Do you think a girl will like you
or fall in love with you?

384
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,120
You're not something to be loved,

385
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,840
You're something to be scared off!

386
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,159
-But...
-If you dare to follow me...

387
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
Or you try to trouble me...

388
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,080
I'll have you sent to prison!
Understood?

389
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,199
Don't!

390
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,440
You want to bring
a girl here to order us around!

391
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,120
We won't let this happen!

392
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,480
Have you ever thought,

393
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,000
if a girl joins this house,
our lives will be a living hell.

394
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,640
No way. We won't let
a girl enter our home? Never.

395
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,440
-We don't want her.
-Stupid jerks!

396
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,120
Can't you see I'm doing
this for you?

397
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,840
How is this gonna help us?

398
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,760
If a woman comes here,
she'll make tasty food for you.

399
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,400
She'll do the dishes
and sweep and swab...

400
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,360
-She'll cook...
-Yes.

401
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,680
-And clean too?
-Yes.

402
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,640
-Sweep...?
-Obviously.

403
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,520
That means no problems.

404
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,440
No problems at all.

405
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,040
We never thought of that.

406
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,040
Do something. She came in like
a cool breeze and left like a storm!

407
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,160
Don't worry,
I'll talk to her and get her back.

408
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,640
-Like the cool breeze...
-Really?

409
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,600
Yes. But for the
time being you get lost.

410
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,000
Let me think of a plan to coax her back.

411
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,440
-Go...
-Come on.

412
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,360
Ravi, what are you doing?

413
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,560
Deceiving a simple girl...
isn't the right thing to do.

414
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,160
I am a great actor, aren't I?

415
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,800
I said all this bullshit to stop
our army from revolting.

416
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,520
The truth is... I really love her.

417
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,160
You're looking exquisite. Beautiful.

418
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,680
The moon itself
won't be able to withstand such beauty.

419
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
I fear for your poor husband.

420
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,640
This is Indu, my best friend.

421
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,120
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

422
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,040
Your best friend is
here but my best friend...

423
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,120
How has a flower bloomed
in the midst of a desert?

424
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,080
The suit, the perfume...
the clean-shaven look...

425
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,560
-Neat and tidy... Terrific!
-My good man.

426
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,440
Somebody told me that...

427
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,080
the beauty of one's heart doesn't matter,
what matters is the beauty of their body.

428
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,880
One's thoughts don't matter...

429
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,320
if the clothes they wear are smart.

430
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,680
So, I decided to give it a try.

431
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,440
-You seem to be in love?
-I tried giving a girl my heart, but...

432
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,520
she dumped it as if it were a watermelon.

433
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:03,000
<span style="style.center_1">My beloved,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">How long will you torment me?</span>

434
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:10,600
<span style="style.center_1">I'll light a fire in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Your heart that will melt you</span>

435
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,480
<span style="style.center_1">My beloved,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">How long will you torment me?</span>

436
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:25,680
<span style="style.center_1">I'll light a fire in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Your heart that will melt you</span>

437
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,440
<span style="style.center_1">One day... you will fall in love</span>

438
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,840
<span style="style.center_1">I'll light a fire in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Your heart that will melt you</span>

439
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,320
<span style="style.center_1">When you think of me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">In your lonely moments...</span>

440
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,160
<span style="style.center_1">You'll be surrounded by my memories</span>

441
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,880
<span style="style.center_1">When you think of me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">In your lonely moments...</span>

442
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,080
<span style="style.center_1">You'll be surrounded by my memories</span>

443
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:35,360
<span style="style.center_1">Your heart will beat</span>
<span style="style.center_1">With anticipation and passion</span>

444
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:42,680
<span style="style.center_1">My beloved,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">how long will you torment me?</span>

445
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:51,200
<span style="style.center_1">I'll light a fire in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">your heart that will melt you</span>

446
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,880
<span style="style.center_1">You'll bloom when our hearts unite</span>

447
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,920
<span style="style.center_1">You'll be swinging in my arms</span>

448
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,600
<span style="style.center_1">You'll bloom when our hearts unite</span>

449
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,280
<span style="style.center_1">You'll be swinging in my arms</span>

450
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,120
<span style="style.center_1">You won't be in your senses</span>

451
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,160
<span style="style.center_1">You will fall in love</span>

452
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,840
<span style="style.center_1">My beloved,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">how long will you torment me?</span>

453
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,560
<span style="style.center_1">I'll light a fire in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">your heart that will melt you</span>

454
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:23,000
<span style="style.center_1">One day... you will fall in love</span>

455
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,520
<span style="style.center_1">I'll light a fire in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">your heart that will melt you</span>

456
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,680
Congratulations.

457
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,680
Yes?

458
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,320
One minute.

459
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,520
Congratulations.

460
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,320
Come.

461
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,720
What was that?

462
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,560
Nothing, I was just looking
for the firecrackers.

463
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,640
Why do you need firecrackers?

464
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,760
Use your brain sometimes.

465
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,040
Our brother is bringing
his wife home for the first time.

466
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,480
We must arrange a grand welcome.

467
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm so happy.

468
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,240
I had never imagined
I'd find a man like yourself.

469
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,440
You and your younger brother...

470
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,400
just three of us...

471
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,800
far from the bustling city.

472
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Peace and quiet all around.

473
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,520
Can't you see? Are you blind?

474
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,600
-Donkey...
-Mind your tongue!

475
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,320
I hate noise and yelling.

476
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,040
I see. You hate yelling.

477
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,160
Yes.

478
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm in trouble...

479
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,400
How dare you beat up my little brother!

480
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,040
Why are you quiet? Say something.

481
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,720
What can I say?
Your thoughts worry me a little.

482
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,200
-Worry?
-Yes... worry with a little bit of joy.

483
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,240
Like tears of joy...
it's worry with joy.

484
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,000
You like cleanliness,
tranquility, hate fights...

485
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,880
and most importantly you're
happy that there's just the three of us.

486
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,800
I'm doomed.

487
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,800
What?

488
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,680
Groom... I can't believe I'm finally
a groom.

489
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,640
Sister-in-law, your dramatic
brother-in-law welcomes you.

490
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,520
Hello.

491
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,360
You know him... Shani,
my little brother.

492
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,320
And this is our home,
our little heaven, our--

493
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,600
Sister-in-law.

494
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,320
My brother.

495
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,360
This is my second
scoundrel... my brother...

496
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,880
Hello.

497
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,080
He's the third.

498
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,600
Hello, sister-in-law.

499
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,240
Let me show you my farm.

500
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,240
No... why would we go around...
our clothes have gotten a little dirty.

501
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,480
Mine too.

502
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,240
-Shall we... go in?
-Welcome.

503
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,680
Sister-in-law.

504
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,400
Come.

505
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,960
This is the living room where
this is where we--

506
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,880
He's my fourth brother, Som.

507
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,400
And the fifth...

508
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,800
-Hello sister-in-law.
-He's my...

509
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,680
I know!

510
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,600
-Your sixth brother.
-Yes, Budhu...

511
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,480
-Budh.
-Yes.

512
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,800
Is that all?
Or do you have a few more?

513
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,400
-There's just seven of us.
-Just seven?

514
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,320
My father wanted a family
big enough to pack stadiums.

515
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,480
But...

516
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,040
He named us after days.

517
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,920
Shani is the youngest and I'm the eldest.

518
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,840
Had you been more than seven...?

519
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,480
-January. February. March. April. May.
-Wow! Amazing!

520
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,400
What a calendrical family!

521
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,640
What is special about our bond
is the love that we share...

522
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,760
-I cannot explain it.
-I'm not asking for an explanation.

523
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,960
-We'd die for each other.
-I can see that.

524
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,240
What?

525
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,320
What is this?

526
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,120
-Kitchen!
-More like a mad house!

527
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,800
Whatever. This is all we have.
Call it whatever you like.

528
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,080
But make it as beautiful as you are.

529
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,520
Don't be romantic.
My head is reeling.

530
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,400
Let me clean up. Go out.

531
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,360
Listen to me, Indu.

532
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,360
Rustle up such a meal
that we eat up the plates too.

533
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,160
We haven't eaten well since mother died.

534
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,520
All we make is either under-cooked
or overdone. Salt in place of sugar...

535
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,760
Chili instead of salt.
Kerosene instead of oil...

536
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,960
Forget it. Go and relax.

537
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,200
I'll call you soon as food is ready.

538
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
Where do I begin?

539
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,040
Dinner is ready. Be quick.

540
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,320
What are you waiting for? Dig in.

541
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,760
I see... thank God,
you have some manners.

542
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,600
Stop it! I say, stop!

543
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,600
Animals! You are all animals!

544
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,800
Is this the way to eat?

545
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,760
I cooked for you with
such love and cleanliness!

546
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,880
And you're devouring the food like
animals.

547
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,400
You don't deserve it!

548
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,360
You're all animals!
That is what you'll always be!

549
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,680
Is she here to cook or to dominate us?

550
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,560
You said you were getting a maid?

551
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,040
Don't touch me! Go away!

552
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,280
You're a cheat! You lied to me!

553
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,520
You'd told me Shani
is the only family you have.

554
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,440
You feigned innocence
and brought me here!

555
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,520
You told your brothers that
you're getting them a maid!

556
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,720
She will cook and clean the house.

557
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,360
Am I here to be their maid?

558
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,040
I quit my job, my city

559
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,640
and followed you here to this madhouse!

560
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,800
This is very wrong. You cheated me.

561
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,120
You broke my heart. Ruined my life!

562
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,000
You are right.

563
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,680
I admit my fault.

564
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,680
I lied to you, deceived you.

565
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,560
I did try to tell you the
truth but didn't have the guts.

566
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,040
If I'd told you about my brothers,
you'd want to meet them.

567
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,480
You would never marry me
after meeting them.

568
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,800
I would have lost you.

569
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,120
I did this to win your love.

570
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,360
Really...

571
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,080
We are animals.

572
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,480
There's no difference between us but...

573
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,400
What could we do?

574
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,960
We were very young
when our parents died.

575
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,920
We were never scolded by a father
nor were we pacified by a mother.

576
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,920
There was nobody to hold
our finger and show us the path.

577
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,040
We just held each
other and came this far.

578
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,280
Living on this farm with the
cows and goats, we have become animals.

579
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,360
I realize my mistake.

580
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,000
I don't want to ruin
your life along with mine.

581
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,000
Tomorrow...

582
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,920
I'll take you back to the city.

583
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,360
You can go back to the
world of honor and etiquette.

584
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,600
You won't have to live with these animals.

585
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Stay here... just for the night.

586
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,240
I'll take you back tomorrow.

587
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Sister-in-law.

588
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,160
Sister-in-law.

589
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,480
Sister-in-law.

590
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,360
Please forgive your younger brothers.

591
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,240
We've all come to beg for forgiveness.

592
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,800
If our words have hurt you,
please hit us!

593
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,520
Beat us black and blue!

594
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,760
But don't leave us!

595
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,920
If you leave,
we'll all be lonely, very lonely.

596
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,320
Nobody has ever helped us.

597
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:13,040
Honestly. And we just look big,

598
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,920
but we're children at heart.

599
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,560
Won't you forgive your children?

600
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:29,040
If you leave, Ravi too will leave us.

601
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,680
Without both of you, we'll be orphaned.

602
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,760
Sister-in-law, please.

603
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,520
Forgive us!

604
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,400
Looks like my animals can cry.

605
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,400
Wipe your tears. Men don't cry.

606
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,160
I forgive all of you.

607
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,560
Now go and tell your
28 feet tall brother...

608
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,320
If he has any sense,
he must come up immediately.

609
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,400
It's our first day of marriage.
He must come with a smile.

610
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,000
Go on.

611
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,360
Get up! Wake up you bull!

612
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,680
-Thief!
-Get up.

613
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,280
Get up, you hippo!

614
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,240
Why are you yelling early in the morning?

615
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,280
I've been dreaming for six days.

616
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,880
Each time I'm about to grab the girl,
somebody wakes me up!

617
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,520
Take look around our room
and you'll all scream!

618
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,960
-Look...
-Our clothes!

619
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,640
Strut around in your underwear now!

620
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,400
-Hold on... where's Shani?
-Not here.

621
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,280
-No?
-He's behind this!

622
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,480
-Are you awake?
-Sister-in-law!

623
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,440
Yes. We are ready.

624
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,280
Get up. Your brother
is taking us for a picnic.

625
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,440
Yes.

626
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,720
We would get ready but that rascal
Shani took our clothes.

627
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,840
Shani didn't do it,
I took all your clothes.

628
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,720
Sister-in-law, you?

629
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,800
What will you do with our clothes?

630
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,720
I'll wash them.

631
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:02,160
Why are you ruining them?
Clothes should never be washed.

632
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,640
Your clothes were
so filthy and stinky...

633
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,360
that a rat would fall dead after
sniffing them!

634
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,720
I washed them in boiling
water yet they're dirty.

635
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:17,080
You have ruined our clothes.

636
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
Come out, shower and get ready.

637
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,720
-What?
-Shower and shave...

638
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,800
wear clean clothes and
join us for the picnic like humans.

639
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,760
Water makes me sick.

640
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,080
I faint if I see anyone showering.

641
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,880
God has graced us with such lovely hair,
why should we shave it off?

642
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,360
-Sister-in-law.
-Sister-in-law.

643
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,480
Will you come out or should I come in?

644
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,400
She's bluffing. We're in such a
shabby state. She won't come in.

645
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,000
Yes, you are right.

646
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,400
I'm asking for the last
time, are you coming out or...

647
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,240
-No! We won’t!
-Okay, then I'll come in.

648
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,160
No!

649
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,560
-Come out fast.
-Oh my God!

650
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,960
Sister-in-law...

651
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,400
Only you can change these beasts.

652
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,760
What I couldn’t do for years,
you did it in just two days.

653
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,080
I'm here to change all
seven not just these five.

654
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,280
What are you waiting for?
Out.

655
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,080
-Where to?
-Go take a shower.

656
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,000
I dry cleaned myself
the day we got married.

657
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,240
You'll have to jump
in the water and bathe.

658
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,440
Quiet.

659
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,680
Come on. Come on.

660
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,120
Come on. Come on.

661
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,200
What are you looking at? Come on.

662
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,680
<span style="style.center_1">Clean and smooth</span>

663
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,560
<span style="style.center_1">It's a Topaz shave</span>

664
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,560
Nose.

665
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,800
<span style="style.center_1">Look at my face, Topaz, Topaz</span>

666
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,960
<span style="style.center_1">Topaz</span>

667
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,200
All ready? Let's get started.

668
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,880
Ravi, what happened?

669
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,640
Stomach... ache!

670
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,000
Press his stomach!

671
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,880
-What are you doing?
-Your leg ached the other day.

672
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,440
It was better once we pressed it.
So we're pressing your stomach!

673
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,160
Stop! Will you press
my neck if it hurts?

674
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,160
Yes.

675
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,480
Move aside...

676
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,640
-What's going on?
-His stomach aches.

677
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,440
No... everything seems fine.

678
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,360
I'm not faking it.
I can feel the pain deep inside my body.

679
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,200
Get the bags.
We'll cancel the picnic.

680
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,840
Don't cancel the picnic.
I'm feeling better.

681
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,480
No, Ravi.

682
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,040
We can't go leaving you here like this.

683
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,000
My sweets, my baby...

684
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,640
You go on.
Yes. Indu will take care of me.

685
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,240
How can we leave you here like this?

686
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,560
-They are right.
-You're funny.

687
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,000
They've really been looking forward
to the picnic.

688
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,280
Let them go. How can I stop them?

689
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,040
Leave right now! Go!

690
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,440
-Yes, let's go.
-Come on.

691
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,160
-Good.
-Come on.

692
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,200
Are you alright?

693
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,040
-Yes. I am fine.
-Let's go.

694
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,960
Finally.

695
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:43,160
-Your stomach...
-Excuse to get rid of them.

696
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,360
If the battalion stays here...

697
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:51,360
how can the commander enjoy himself?

698
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,880
Come here.

699
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,240
What a relief!

700
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,640
Girls!

701
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:50,200
<span style="style.center_1">Glorious weather, unknown destination</span>

702
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,480
<span style="style.center_1">Glorious weather, unknown destination</span>

703
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,920
<span style="style.center_1">There's a tale waiting</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To be told at some curve</span>

704
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,320
<span style="style.center_1">Glorious weather, unknown destination</span>

705
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,480
<span style="style.center_1">There's a tale waiting</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To be told at some curve</span>

706
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,960
<span style="style.center_1">Often, my heart starts pounding</span>

707
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,000
<span style="style.center_1">The glow of youth torments me</span>

708
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,720
<span style="style.center_1">Often, my heart starts pounding</span>

709
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,640
<span style="style.center_1">The glow of youth torments me</span>

710
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,360
<span style="style.center_1">When will my heart</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Belong to another?</span>

711
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,200
<span style="style.center_1">When will my heart</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Belong to another?</span>

712
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,520
<span style="style.center_1">For the time being it's mine</span>

713
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,920
<span style="style.center_1">Glorious weather, unknown destination</span>

714
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,800
<span style="style.center_1">There's a tale waiting</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To be told at some curve</span>

715
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:17,840
<span style="style.center_1">Certain thoughts scare me</span>

716
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,000
<span style="style.center_1">Nights full of</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Love are around the corner</span>

717
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:27,520
<span style="style.center_1">Certain thoughts scare me</span>

718
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:32,520
<span style="style.center_1">Nights full of</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Love are around the corner</span>

719
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:37,000
<span style="style.center_1">Everyone knows fools fall in love</span>

720
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,840
<span style="style.center_1">Everyone knows fools fall in love</span>

721
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,560
<span style="style.center_1">Have no fears for it is inevitable</span>

722
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,400
<span style="style.center_1">Glorious weather, unknown destination</span>

723
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,800
<span style="style.center_1">There's a tale waiting</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To be told at some curve</span>

724
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,760
You fool! Why didn't you run
when you saw the boulder?

725
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:57,000
These rich people need maids
to help them escape death too!

726
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:57,960
You are right.

727
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:03,480
Excuse me but she's not one of
those who can't move without maids.

728
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,360
In fact, she's one of those rich people...

729
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,800
...who can't move at all.

730
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,720
Can't move? Her feet seem alright.

731
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,000
Is she a cripple? Is she handicapped?

732
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,319
You are right. She can't walk.

733
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:24,399
We're sorry. We shouldn't have said
the things we did.

734
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,279
We didn't know about you.
We spoke nonsense.

735
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,680
Doesn't matter.
A cripple...

736
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:37,000
gets used to bitter medicines
as well as bitter words.

737
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,920
I'm used to it.

738
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:43,760
The thing is... we're all idiots.

739
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,760
There's no connection between our tongue
and our brain. The wiring is messed up.

740
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,479
Please smile...

741
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,960
What are your names?

742
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,520
I am Seema. This is Madhu.

743
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,120
This is Rachna.

744
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,359
This is Prema.

745
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:16,240
I am Guru.

746
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:20,439
We're so glad to meet you.

747
01:09:21,479 --> 01:09:26,040
The Red Cross Society is having
a program on Sunday. You must come.

748
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,479
Of course.

749
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:34,240
Should I...

750
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,279
We... did it!

751
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,279
Quiet! I don't want
to hear you excuses!

752
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,040
All of you are useless!
Good for nothing!

753
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,920
I do everything for you!
I provide you with every possible comfort!

754
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,080
But the six of you can't
look after my poor niece!

755
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,720
-Shame on you!
-It's not their fault.

756
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,120
-I asked them to go.
-But why did they leave you?

757
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,320
They should always be
with you. That's their duty!

758
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,320
God forbid, if the
boulder would have touched you...

759
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,320
how would I face the world?

760
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:22,040
Everyone would say an uncle
got his rich niece killed...

761
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,560
because she's going to be 21...

762
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,560
and she's going to inherit millions.

763
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,480
None of you know...

764
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:44,640
how difficult it is to
be a trustee to a wealthy heiress.

765
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,360
People suspect you all the time.

766
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:56,040
I pray to God that you
complete your 21st birthday...

767
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,960
I'll hand over every
penny of your inheritance...

768
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,200
and...

769
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,200
I'll go far away.

770
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,680
If I have hurt you...

771
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,640
It's not my fault.

772
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,640
I swear, I did my best!

773
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,880
But...

774
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,800
I hate unprofessional men.

775
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,360
-Had it not been for the boys...
-Whatever, the girl is still alive!

776
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,640
Isn’t she?

777
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,000
Get out.

778
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:05,200
But darling,
we have time on our hands.

779
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,640
And she lives with you,
crushing her should be an easy task.

780
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:12,880
-Isn't it?
-No.

781
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,520
You are wrong.

782
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,560
-I can't do this at home.
-Why?

783
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,840
If she is killed outside,
they cannot blame me.

784
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,280
Only Babu can do this.

785
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,440
Who’s Babu?

786
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,880
A devil in a human form.

787
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,120
Where is he?

788
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,200
Serving his sentence in a prison.

789
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,320
Once Babu is released from the jail...

790
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,080
he'll release Seema from this earth.

791
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,200
No. No way!

792
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,600
None of you will go
to the Red Cross party!

793
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:01,640
Why not? The poor girls have invited us
so decently, with such love.

794
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,840
With love? With decency?

795
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,840
Do you know what love or decency is?

796
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,520
-Of course, we do.
-What is decency?

797
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,880
Decency... it means...

798
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,640
What is it? It's...

799
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,040
It's very nice.

800
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,000
Why are you looking at me?
Talk to her.

801
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,200
Don't embarrass yourself. Sit tight.

802
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,440
Have you seen how you walk?

803
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,480
You look like seven prisoners
released after life imprisonment!

804
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,720
When you speak, it sounds
as if somebody is throwing vessels!

805
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,560
If you open your mouth in the city,
all the girls will flee!

806
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:00,560
So the best thing is
to sit at home quietly.

807
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,840
Sister-in-law.

808
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:07,440
Nobody learns everything in the womb.

809
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,800
You learn it after birth.

810
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:14,160
From your own people
and all we have...

811
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,520
is you. Please teach us.

812
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,520
-Please...
-Very well. I'll try.

813
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,680
-Hey sister-in-law!
-Please teach us!

814
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,560
Play some tune.

815
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,640
Bow respectfully and ask her...

816
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:46,000
Not like this.
Please act it out.

817
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,200
<span style="style.center_1">Bow respectfully and ask her...</span>

818
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,680
<span style="style.center_1">Bow respectfully and ask her...</span>

819
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,240
<span style="style.center_1">When she asks you, how do you do...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Just say...</span>

820
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,920
Did you get it?

821
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,320
<span style="style.center_1">Bow respectfully and ask her...</span>

822
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,920
<span style="style.center_1">When she asks you, how do you do...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Just say...</span>

823
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,120
Really?

824
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,360
Let me see how you do it.

825
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,240
Not so soon, my love.

826
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,240
<span style="style.center_1">She'll blush, if she likes you</span>

827
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:16,920
<span style="style.center_1">That's how, you'll know...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">If the fish has taken the bait</span>

828
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:22,280
<span style="style.center_1">She'll blush, if she likes you</span>

829
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,840
<span style="style.center_1">That's how, you'll know...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">If the fish has taken the bait</span>

830
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,680
<span style="style.center_1">Look into her eyes and</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Tell her that she's cast a spell on you</span>

831
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,120
<span style="style.center_1">When she asks you,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What's the spell?</span>

832
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,840
<span style="style.center_1">Tell her...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Why are you quiet?</span>

833
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,520
<span style="style.center_1">Yes.</span>

834
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,120
Now you're getting it!

835
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,960
-Shall we proceed?
-Just a minute.

836
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,920
Shut up!
I've some serious doubts.

837
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,680
What if she doesn't blush?

838
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,680
Silly.

839
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:02,000
If she doesn't blush, some other girl
will.

840
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,720
-Really?
-Yes!

841
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:31,720
<span style="style.center_1">Hold her hand lovingly</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And take her to a corner</span>

842
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:37,440
<span style="style.center_1">She'll be a little scared</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Just like you</span>

843
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:43,760
<span style="style.center_1">Hold her hand lovingly</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And take her to a corner</span>

844
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,400
<span style="style.center_1">She'll be a little scared</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Just like you</span>

845
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:54,320
<span style="style.center_1">Hold her and say...</span>

846
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,560
Don't be silent.

847
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:02,680
-Where did I go wrong?
-At this point... say... I love you!

848
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:55,880
<span style="style.center_1">It's a fair of fairies</span>

849
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,840
<span style="style.center_1">Every heart is alone</span>

850
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,600
<span style="style.center_1">It's a fair of fairies</span>

851
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,720
<span style="style.center_1">Every heart is alone</span>

852
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:05,520
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here</span>

853
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,440
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here</span>

854
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,280
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here</span>

855
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:17,520
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here</span>

856
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,360
<span style="style.center_1">Glorious weather</span>

857
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,960
<span style="style.center_1">Unknown is the destination.</span>

858
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:45,880
<span style="style.center_1">A tale waits to unfold</span>

859
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,960
<span style="style.center_1">It's a fair of fairies</span>

860
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,960
<span style="style.center_1">Every heart is alone</span>

861
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,960
<span style="style.center_1">It's a fair of fairies</span>

862
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:44,040
<span style="style.center_1">Every heart is alone</span>

863
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,720
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here.</span>

864
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,280
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here.</span>

865
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:55,400
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here.</span>

866
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:00,280
<span style="style.center_1">Let the hearts meet, the spring is here.</span>

867
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,400
You think this is bad?
I've seen worse.

868
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,680
Sit tight! One word from you...

869
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,160
I'll burn your back with a flaming log!

870
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,040
I know you have a strong body!

871
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,360
I had taught these fools everything!

872
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,520
And you ruined it!

873
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,000
Those city boys... bred in the gutter!

874
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,680
I should have watched
them beating up my brothers!

875
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:20,240
-What honor would we have left with?
-Great. After what you've done...

876
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:23,600
the entire city must
be gossiping about you!

877
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:28,040
The cops could have locked all of us up.

878
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:32,640
What do you mean? We should have been
humble boys and asked them...

879
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,720
"Brothers, beat us up. You own us.

880
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,840
Tell us when you are tired
so that we can drop you off home."

881
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,800
What nonsense!

882
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,640
Fine. Do as you please.

883
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,880
And I'll do as I please.

884
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:50,840
-Don't say that...
-Let go. I'm furious!

885
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:54,160
If you get furious, what will we eat?

886
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,160
-Stop kidding.
-You were there.

887
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:03,000
Tell us did we pick a
fight or did they force us?

888
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,720
But I want to know why did you fight?

889
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:12,320
They were present. How could
we get thrashed in front of them?

890
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,320
-Who?
-They...

891
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:21,680
From the day we met those girls,
we feel something.

892
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,840
You guys have lost it!

893
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,600
You were already good for nothing
now you're doomed!

894
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,240
Is this how you read a book?

895
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,320
-I...
-No need to explain.

896
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:45,040
Everyone is lost. One meeting
with the boys has changed everything!

897
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:46,600
Where's Shobhini?

898
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,640
Madam, please add salt to the lentils.

899
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,040
Why are we suddenly leaving for Pune?

900
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,880
Tomorrow is the 3rd.
Babu will be released.

901
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,880
He'll do our job on the 4th.

902
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:15,680
And I'll be talking to the

903
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:21,680
lawyer regarding Seema's property.

904
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,440
If anyone suspects me of killing Seema...

905
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,760
the lawyer will testify
that I was with him.

906
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:34,160
Seema's inheritance will
be mine on the 5th.

907
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:53,520
Is this supposed to be
another one of your protests?

908
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,680
Why are you looking at me like
dumb fools?

909
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,080
Get on with the job or
you won't get food!

910
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,880
They're not moving
even after I mentioned food!

911
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,320
-What is it?
-Something’s happened.

912
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,680
Something has happened to the boys.
Are they drunk?

913
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,360
Have you seen them? They look sick!

914
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,680
As if they have no life!

915
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,800
What a great brother you are!
Don't you know anything?

916
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,000
-What is it?
-They are in love.

917
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,640
What does that mean?

918
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:39,720
What a nuisance!
You're equally dumb!

919
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,880
They are in love.

920
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:51,520
In love?

921
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,120
<span style="style.center_1">It was a spark in</span>

922
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:02,200
<span style="style.center_1">you that made me love you</span>

923
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:13,440
<span style="style.center_1">Explain it to me for I do not understand</span>

924
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:27,000
<span style="style.center_1">When one falls in love...</span>

925
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:36,560
<span style="style.center_1">the heart beats faster</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And one feels restless</span>

926
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:45,200
<span style="style.center_1">When somebody counts</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The stars at night...</span>

927
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:53,720
<span style="style.center_1">assume the man is in love</span>

928
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:07,880
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to you</span>

929
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:16,160
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs...</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide</span>

930
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:25,680
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to us</span>

931
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,280
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs...</span>

932
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:34,520
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide me</span>

933
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,240
<span style="style.center_1">Switch off the lights</span>

934
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,440
<span style="style.center_1">Switch off the light</span>

935
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:19,000
<span style="style.center_1">Switch off the lights</span>
<span style="style.center_1">For I can't fall asleep</span>

936
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:26,640
<span style="style.center_1">Switching the lights</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Off will not help me to sleep</span>

937
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:37,400
<span style="style.center_1">When will the girl come</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Who will switch off the light?</span>

938
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:47,640
<span style="style.center_1">Don't make noise</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Or you'll wake up my wife</span>

939
01:33:55,040 --> 01:34:02,920
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to you</span>

940
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,280
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs...</span>

941
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:09,600
<span style="style.center_1">Somebody please tell me the future</span>

942
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:20,200
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to us</span>

943
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,040
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs...</span>

944
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:28,920
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide</span>

945
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,200
Want my guidance?

946
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,240
Let's get the girls.

947
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:50,000
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to you</span>

948
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,680
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs...</span>

949
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:56,320
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide</span>

950
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:03,240
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to us</span>

951
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,160
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs...</span>

952
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:11,200
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide</span>

953
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:21,240
<span style="style.center_1">Things aren't so bad</span>

954
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:27,440
<span style="style.center_1">When the hearts are one</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Why should there be distance</span>

955
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:34,520
<span style="style.center_1">We'll get them</span>
<span style="style.center_1">If we have the guts...</span>

956
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:40,440
<span style="style.center_1">Even if the family doesn't allow</span>

957
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:47,800
<span style="style.center_1">We'll get them</span>
<span style="style.center_1">If we have the guts...</span>

958
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:53,800
<span style="style.center_1">Even if the family doesn't allow</span>

959
01:35:55,480 --> 01:36:01,560
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to us</span>

960
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,920
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs</span>

961
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,600
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide</span>

962
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,560
<span style="style.center_1">Look what love has done to us</span>

963
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,520
<span style="style.center_1">The heart sighs</span>

964
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,400
<span style="style.center_1">Wishes somebody could guide</span>

965
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,160
You!

966
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,560
Why aren't you sleeping?
It's pretty late.

967
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:34,320
I stayed up
to witness your deeds.

968
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,080
Let the girls go.

969
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,480
Untie them.

970
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:48,400
Save us!

971
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:54,200
These boys have kidnapped us.

972
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,640
Don't worry. I'll handle them.

973
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,200
So, this was your plan.

974
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,400
What were you thinking when
you kidnapped these girls?

975
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,760
I thought they were girls.

976
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,240
Do you know what a
grave crime you've committed?

977
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,960
Why are you standing with heads lowered?

978
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,640
-Answer me!
-Answer what?

979
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:20,920
You are the reason why
all this has happened!

980
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:22,880
What did I tell you?

981
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:25,400
I had asked you why the boys look lost.

982
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,040
You said they were
in love... with the girls.

983
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,600
-Yes.
-Quiet!

984
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:37,120
But is it right to forcibly
kidnap somebody from their homes?

985
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,480
We didn't force them.
We brought them with care.

986
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:44,120
What else could I do?
Look at my brothers.

987
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,880
Faces hanging down to their knees.

988
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:48,800
They neither eat nor
drink nor sleep or work.

989
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:52,000
I too have a duty towards my brothers.

990
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,720
Bravo! What a duty you've performed!

991
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,720
You should get a reward
from the government.

992
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:01,960
Quiet. Now hear me carefully.

993
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:05,080
It's late so the girls
will stay here tonight.

994
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,080
Inside. With me.

995
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,840
I'll take them back tomorrow morning.

996
01:40:10,120 --> 01:40:14,880
And you'll sleep out in the stable.

997
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,520
Come on in.

998
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,880
-One for all, all for one!
-One for all, all for one!

999
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,560
I think the night's episode scared her.

1000
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,000
I can't let her go in this state.

1001
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,080
Let's inform her family.

1002
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,400
Whom can we inform?

1003
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,440
She has an uncle who has already
left for Pune for a week.

1004
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,360
-Call the servant.
-Okay but with the boys...

1005
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,960
How can we stay here?

1006
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,920
With me around,
you need not worry.

1007
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:58,600
As long as you're here,
none of the brothers will step in.

1008
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,440
Not even my husband.

1009
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,640
We'll send a telegram to Seema's uncle.
What is the Pune address?

1010
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:13,840
Now I know why Babu couldn't do the job.

1011
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:14,960
What do you mean?

1012
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,520
How could he kill Seema,
when she wasn't home?

1013
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,880
She's gone to the farmhouse
with her friends.

1014
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,680
-They have sent a telegram.
-Now what?

1015
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:31,680
I will have to meet Babu and
plan ahead.

1016
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:36,960
But first I must go
and meet my sweet niece.

1017
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,560
-No fever.
-But I feel weak.

1018
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,320
Live here for a few
days in this fresh air...

1019
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,320
eat the fresh produce
of this farm that I cook.

1020
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,280
And you'll be fine.

1021
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:01,200
Please don't tell your uncle
that my husband

1022
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:06,640
and his... stupid clan kidnapped you.

1023
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:09,200
No. Why would I tell him?

1024
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,240
Actually, they're not dangerous,
they're just silly.

1025
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,680
Tell him, he's not allowed inside.

1026
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,280
He must leave or
there would be consequences.

1027
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,360
Did you hear?

1028
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,800
Tell this guard that I don't
harbor any desire to come in.

1029
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,200
I'm going to the city for a few days,
so I wish to speak to my guests.

1030
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,400
All that happened
yesterday was my mistake.

1031
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:49,040
I saw my brothers were sad...

1032
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,000
and made this stupid mistake.

1033
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,840
So please forgive me.

1034
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,360
The children aren't at fault.
It was my mistake.

1035
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:08,840
You might not be here when I will return.

1036
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,160
You would have gone home.

1037
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,120
So, I came here to apologize.

1038
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:18,720
If possible, forgive
this elder brother of yours.

1039
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,640
Listen...

1040
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,400
I'll be waiting for you.
Make sure you're back by Friday.

1041
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:37,280
If I inadvertently hurt
you or your feelings...

1042
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,400
forgive me...

1043
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,800
The Devil is here.

1044
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,600
Thank God, she's fine.

1045
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,720
Her health is my biggest worry.

1046
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:09,760
She's my elder brother's
child but I love her a lot.

1047
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,360
-Thank you so much...
-What for?

1048
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:16,720
She's like my younger sister too.

1049
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,720
Seema hasn't recovered yet.
I'd like her to rest here.

1050
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,880
But I can't stop you
from taking her home.

1051
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:30,360
If she's not well, let her be here.
I won't let her move.

1052
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,680
I can bear to be away from her.

1053
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:37,080
But I can't bear that she's unwell.

1054
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,160
You may keep her here for a few days.

1055
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,840
If you need anything,
I'll send it from town.

1056
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,160
By the grace of God,
we have everything we need.

1057
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,840
Just send them some
clothes and medicines for the girls.

1058
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:51,160
-I'll get them tomorrow.
-No, please...

1059
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,880
my husband is in town.
He'll return in a couple of days.

1060
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:57,080
-Give it to him.
-Where in the town?

1061
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:00,040
He's with his friend, Shekhar.

1062
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:05,720
Hello.

1063
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:07,960
Speaking.

1064
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,520
-Ranjit Singh here.
-Sorry, do I know you?

1065
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:14,960
Seema is staying at
your farm with her nurses.

1066
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,680
Yes, of course.

1067
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,000
I'm her uncle.

1068
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,080
Oh! What can I do for you?

1069
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:27,360
I'd gone to the farm. Your wife
asked me to send some items.

1070
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,080
I'll come to your home tomorrow
and pick them up then.

1071
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,120
-Something wrong?
-No.

1072
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,720
I hope you had no problems getting here.

1073
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:02,920
No.

1074
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,720
Have a seat. Drink?

1075
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:15,440
Why were you staring at me?

1076
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,800
You remind me of a very dear friend.

1077
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:23,120
He's very much like you.
Tall and broad shouldered...

1078
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:25,360
Young, handsome.

1079
01:46:30,520 --> 01:46:32,680
Are you left-handed?

1080
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:37,640
You use your left hand?

1081
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,320
Yes. My Dad would say...

1082
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,000
use your left hand if you
want the world to treat you right.

1083
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,560
No... this is too much.

1084
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:57,240
I'm not used to drinking.
I don't drink.

1085
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:01,680
You know why?
Because it ruins the liver.

1086
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,520
-Here...
-I see.

1087
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,960
So, I don't drink but that
day at a friend's marriage...

1088
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:12,240
they forced me to gulp four bottles.

1089
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,320
You told me about the farm
house but not your brothers.

1090
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:25,120
My brothers! Each one is a gem!

1091
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,480
I love them a lot.

1092
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,680
The youngest is...

1093
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,120
My youngest brother is so cute!

1094
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,320
I love him a lot.
He's very hard working.

1095
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:46,720
He works the hardest at the farm.

1096
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,200
-Know why?
-Why?

1097
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,960
Doesn't drink liquor.

1098
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,560
Liquor ruins the liver.

1099
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:57,400
I'm not used to drinking.
I went to this friend's wedding...

1100
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:00,800
They forced me to drink four bottles...

1101
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:05,000
-The others?
-What?

1102
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:11,240
Shukra is elder to Shani.

1103
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,960
He is sweet as sugar.

1104
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:16,560
He's very strong.

1105
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,440
He punches straight through the wall.

1106
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:24,440
Very strong. He is a man of steel.

1107
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,440
You know why?
Because he doesn't drink liquor.

1108
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:30,600
-Liquor--
-Ruins the liver.

1109
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:33,880
You're not used to it
but at this friend's wedding...

1110
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,400
-you were forced to drink four bottles.
-Right.

1111
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:40,840
You're too much.
I must kiss you.

1112
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:44,760
Very good.

1113
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,640
-The one elder to him?
-Elder to what?

1114
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,400
Guru is elder to Shukra.

1115
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:57,440
And Budh.

1116
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,400
This brother of mine is a fool.

1117
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:07,000
Like a cow. He's so docile.

1118
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:09,120
Not a cow... buffalo.

1119
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,920
No, buffaloes are black.
Cow, he's a cow.

1120
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:23,040
He knows nothing about any vice.

1121
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:28,920
You know why?
Because he doesn't drink.

1122
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,880
Liquor ruins the liver.

1123
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,520
-I'm not used to--
-Went to a friend's wedding

1124
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,240
and he forced you to drink four bottles.

1125
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:44,520
How do you know?
You're great! I must kiss you!

1126
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,880
Wonderful...

1127
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:51,440
-Who is elder to him?
-What?

1128
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,880
Elder to the Budh... is...

1129
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,880
Hangal is elder to Budh.

1130
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,800
Not Hangal.

1131
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,800
He stammers a bit.

1132
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,360
Very strong... yes.

1133
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:18,680
He can hit a coconut and
break it in five pieces.

1134
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,080
-You know why?
-Because he doesn't drink.

1135
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,800
-Liquor ruins the liver.
-Liver.

1136
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:29,360
You're not used to it but
you went to a friend's wedding...

1137
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:31,120
and he forced you to drink four bottles.

1138
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:35,520
-Kiss...
-You're terrific!

1139
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,840
-Good?
-Yes.

1140
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:44,600
-Who is elder to him?
-Som is elder.

1141
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,040
He talks a bit loudly.

1142
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:53,880
But he's soft.

1143
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,120
Soft nose, soft heart.

1144
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:00,800
Soft...

1145
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:01,680
that's it.

1146
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:07,680
He too is very strong.
You know elephants?

1147
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,120
-May I?
-Yes!

1148
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:13,120
He flies and kicks elephants.

1149
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:17,400
Elephant skull cracks,
the brains spill out.

1150
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:22,200
You know why?
Because he doesn't drink.

1151
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:23,960
Liquor ruins--

1152
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,400
Hey driver, stop!

1153
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,160
Here is Ravi's chain.

1154
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,640
Why are you here?

1155
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,080
Take him away and tie him up.

1156
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:11,440
Did you really think breaking into
our house would be a piece of cake?

1157
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:13,360
Do you think we would never know?

1158
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:17,800
What... what do you mean?

1159
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,080
We know everything about you.

1160
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:37,600
-What do you know?
-Drop the act.

1161
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,960
You know what we mean.

1162
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:46,320
No, I don't know.
What are you guys saying?

1163
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,200
Today is your birthday.

1164
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,720
Where are you taking me?

1165
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:06,400
Listen... wait.

1166
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,960
Look at this!

1167
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:11,440
Ravi gets a chance to go
in because it's his birthday!

1168
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:14,720
-Go in.
-What's inside?

1169
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,320
Your birthday gift.

1170
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:17,600
-Gift...
-Yes.

1171
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:20,400
You and your wife had a squabble
because of us.

1172
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:23,760
As it's your birthday,
it's time for a fresh start.

1173
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,280
The court exonerates you!

1174
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,600
-But...
-Go in.

1175
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:30,960
Open the door!

1176
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:43,880
RAVI

1177
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:04,440
On your birthday, I give you

1178
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:08,400
the best gift a wife,
could ever give her husband.

1179
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:15,680
I'm a bit shy to look you in the eye
and say this.

1180
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:19,080
Hence, I'm writing it.

1181
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:24,160
I am expecting a child...

1182
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:28,120
-Child...
-Yes.

1183
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,520
Why are you running away?

1184
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:47,720
No... people say when
the hearts are one...

1185
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,800
physical distance doesn’t matter
and our hearts are already one.

1186
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,600
-Shall I switch off the light?
-What...?

1187
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:56,560
Yes?

1188
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,640
They can see our shadow downstairs.

1189
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:03,880
No... I haven't come here for that.

1190
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,080
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

1191
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:12,320
-I must write accounts--
-Accounts?

1192
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:18,760
Every moment is difficult
when you go out to work.

1193
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,000
And you'll write accounts
the moment you get back!

1194
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:27,360
Don't you care about my heart,
my feelings?

1195
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,240
I do but...

1196
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,440
-Down with Ravi and Indu!
-Down with Ravi and Indu!

1197
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:33,000
-Down with Ravi and Indu!
-Down with Ravi and Indu!

1198
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,640
-Down with Ravi and Indu!
-Down with Ravi and Indu!

1199
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,440
-Down with Ravi and Indu!
-Down with Ravi and Indu!

1200
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,760
-Down with Ravi and Indu!
-Down with Ravi and Indu!

1201
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:41,880
-You stay in!
-While we are out!

1202
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,680
There's some protest...

1203
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:49,480
It's right. I'm in here comfortable...

1204
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:54,880
they're down there battling mosquitoes...

1205
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,840
it's not fair. Injustice...

1206
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:03,920
I think I should be down there with them.

1207
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:05,920
Your wish.

1208
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:12,080
We won't tolerate any injustice.

1209
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:15,720
Quiet! I'm coming.

1210
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:20,160
I'm coming.
And I have some good news.

1211
02:00:27,560 --> 02:00:31,840
It would have been really shameful that
I sleep inside peacefully

1212
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:36,320
while you're out here in the open.

1213
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:43,280
So I've decided as long as
the girls are here, nobody goes in.

1214
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,560
Come.

1215
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:54,400
You had some good news.
What... is that?

1216
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:57,360
I forgot...

1217
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:02,200
all of you
are going to be uncles.

1218
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,920
When I first got here,
this wasn't a home.

1219
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:16,520
It was an asylum.
I went berserk trying to clean it up.

1220
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,880
The eating habits of--

1221
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,200
-Who is it?
-It's me.

1222
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:26,480
What is it? Why have you come in?

1223
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:30,240
We are freezing out here...

1224
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,800
-Is it?
-May I have a blanket?

1225
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:37,880
-Stand there, I'll get it.
-Please, let me do it.

1226
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:42,160
So, where was I?

1227
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,640
Is it really freezing?

1228
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:50,120
Now that I've seen you...
I feel much better.

1229
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:54,320
Coming.

1230
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:10,840
So, I was telling you about the way
these brothers ate--

1231
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,600
-Now who is it?
-It's me...

1232
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:17,360
-What do you want?
-Girl...

1233
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,280
Girl?

1234
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:23,440
I mean a splinter hit
me while I was chopping wood.

1235
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:26,840
-Want the first aid box?
-Yes. May I come in to take it?

1236
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:29,480
No. Stand there, I'll get it.

1237
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:32,560
Please let me do it.

1238
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:34,960
-You remain seated.
-No, I'll give it.

1239
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:39,520
-The first aid--
-Yes, come out.

1240
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:45,200
I see. This is what they are up to.

1241
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,280
What are you doing here?
You'll never learn!

1242
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:53,880
We're thirsty.
Can we get some water?

1243
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:56,080
-Water? In here?
-Yes.

1244
02:02:56,720 --> 02:03:01,520
If you knock again,
I'll throw you down the well!

1245
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,840
You'll be drinking water
all your lives! Get it?

1246
02:03:03,960 --> 02:03:07,400
Get lost! If anyone
turns, I'll break your legs!

1247
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:09,280
-Come. Let's go.
-We’ll drink water from the well.

1248
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,640
What have you got today?

1249
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:25,840
<span style="style.center_1">This is how things are. Everything's</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a mess. The girls are equally stupid.</span>

1250
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,760
<span style="style.center_1">What more can I do?</span>

1251
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:19,120
You're making a mistake.
Indu is sleeping upstairs.

1252
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:24,680
I thought she's probably here.

1253
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,920
Forgive me.

1254
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:32,920
What's the matter?
What is he doing here at midnight?

1255
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:36,280
He's freezing too,
wanted to borrow a blanket.

1256
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,720
But he's in the wrong room,
asking the wrong girl.

1257
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:51,080
Water.

1258
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:53,280
Water.

1259
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:10,800
Looks like, he's run out of juice.

1260
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:25,280
Why don't you kill Ravi?
His life could put us at risk.

1261
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:26,720
No.

1262
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:28,640
Ravi is useful if he’s alive.

1263
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,640
The moment Babu returns
after killing Seema

1264
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:39,280
I'll send Ravi back and he'll
be charged with killing Seema.

1265
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:52,720
You... Indu isn't here.

1266
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:54,640
She might be outside.

1267
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:57,960
What's wrong?

1268
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

1269
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:06,040
Why... don't you say something?

1270
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:23,160
You...

1271
02:07:23,320 --> 02:07:25,600
you're scaring me.

1272
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:29,280
Stop right there!

1273
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:32,880
Stop right there... please.

1274
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:44,320
Why don't you speak?
What do you want?

1275
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,280
What do you want?

1276
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,320
It's alright.

1277
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:44,960
What's going on?

1278
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:58,480
How did you leave
the chair and come here?

1279
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:18,880
How are you standing on your feet?

1280
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:26,520
That's Ravi's magic.
He scared her with that knife.

1281
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:32,320
-She ran out of her chair. Great.
-You're fantastic!

1282
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,360
He's performed a miracle!

1283
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:37,240
We'd thought Seema would
never walk in her life.

1284
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,920
Brother, you're amazing!

1285
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,360
We only loved you but

1286
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:47,360
now we respect you.

1287
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:54,160
Why are you crying?
You should be happy.

1288
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:57,320
You can go anywhere on your own.

1289
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,480
You are no more dependent on the chair.

1290
02:10:00,200 --> 02:10:03,960
Pray to God to give
you a husband like him.

1291
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:09,880
Who sympathizes with others'
pain and fills their life with joy.

1292
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:19,400
Forgive me.
You came to give me life,

1293
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:23,240
and I thought you wanted to kill me.

1294
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:28,200
I'll never be able to repay this debt!

1295
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:32,520
You're an angel!

1296
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,240
May God give you
all the happiness you deserve.

1297
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:39,840
I pray that all your troubles come to me.

1298
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:46,200
This family should always be happy!

1299
02:10:57,880 --> 02:10:59,000
Enough.

1300
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:05,080
Enough, stop crying.

1301
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:11,040
All your problems...

1302
02:11:11,120 --> 02:11:14,040
your struggle is now over.

1303
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:20,520
Any obstacle in your path
will first have to face me.

1304
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:26,880
I'll give my life to ensure your safety.

1305
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:30,880
No sorrow will torment you.

1306

<span style="style.center_1">Nothing matters</span>

1361
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:29,880
<span style="style.center_1">Whatever be the cards</span>

1362
02:16:29,960 --> 02:16:32,080
<span style="style.center_1">An ace or another card</span>

1363
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:33,879
<span style="style.center_1">Whatever be the cards</span>

1364
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,520
<span style="style.center_1">An ace or another card</span>

1365
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:39,320
<span style="style.center_1">If you look carefully,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Each one is merely a card</span>

1366
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,080
<span style="style.center_1">Finally it matters not</span>

1367
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:42,920
<span style="style.center_1">Finally it matters not</span>

1368
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,719
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing matters</span>

1369
02:16:44,799 --> 02:16:46,639
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing matters</span>

1370
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:48,480
<span style="style.center_1">Finally it matters not</span>

1371
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:50,400
<span style="style.center_1">Finally it matters not</span>

1372
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:51,959
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing matters</span>

1373
02:16:52,360 --> 02:16:53,920
<span style="style.center_1">Nothing matters</span>

1374
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:22,559
-Where are you taking me?
-Come along.

1375
02:17:22,639 --> 02:17:23,840
-What's the matter?
-Come on

1376
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:25,160
At least tell me what’s the matter?

1377
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:32,760
Today is <span style="style.center_1">Karva Chauth.</span>

1378
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:34,920
-<span style="style.center_1">Karva Chauth?</span>
-What?

1379
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:38,840
Today, wives pray for their husband's
life.

1380
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:41,879
May God keep her husband well.

1381
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:08,160
No... I don't deserve it.

1382
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:13,520
What are you saying?

1383
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:14,760
The truth.

1384
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:20,440
I'm not who you think I am.

1385
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:27,280
I'm a criminal who spent
most of his life in jail.

1386
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:33,360
I'm neither anyone's brother
nor anyone's husband.

1387
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:37,719
This isn't true.

1388
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:41,040
I’m not Ravi... I'm Babu.

1389
02:18:48,559 --> 02:18:50,879
If you don't believe me... have a look.

1390
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,320
My name is Babu.

1391
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:06,719
I resemble Ravi.
That's why I was sent here.

1392
02:19:09,879 --> 02:19:14,879
I must kill Seema the
moment I find an opportunity.

1393
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:17,559
-Kill me?
-Yes.

1394
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,440
Your uncle Ranjit Singh has paid

1395
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,480
me one lakh rupees to kill you.

1396
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:30,959
You die and he inherits all your property.

1397
02:19:31,879 --> 02:19:33,240
It'll all be his.

1398
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:38,559
Cheat! Scoundrel!

1399
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:44,080
You pretended to be our brother
and took advantage of our love!

1400
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:46,639
-Don't spare him. Beat him up!
-Thrash him!

1401
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:50,680
-Beat him up!
-Thrash him!

1402
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,960
-Beat him up!
-Thrash him!

1403
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:55,480
Get up, you impostor!

1404
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,720
Don't spare him!

1405
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:05,080
Beat him up!

1406
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:15,840
-Stop...
-You stay out of this!

1407
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,280
I say stop it.
I know he is our enemy.

1408
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,640
He lived in our home and deceived us.

1409
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,680
But he didn't cheat me.

1410
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,160
He didn't deceive my duty, my honor.

1411
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:31,240
He never touched me.

1412
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:37,760
Don't think of what he's done.
Imagine what he could've done.

1413
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:42,680
He lived with us but
never came close to me.

1414
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:48,000
He could have easily gotten away
with anything he wished to do.

1415
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:58,360
A sister-in-law is like mother
and you honored our mother.

1416
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:03,440
Hence, we forgive you but

1417
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:07,000
tell us where our brother is.

1418
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:13,080
I will tell you but I have a request...

1419
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,560
this story began with me
and I will bring it to an end.

1420
02:21:19,480 --> 02:21:22,280
Babu is your brother till Ravi returns.

1421
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:24,040
He is with you.

1422
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,360
I beg your forgiveness for my actions.

1423
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:44,040
The truth is that my
origins are disgraceful.

1424
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,320
I grew up in an environment
of deception and perfidy.

1425
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:52,360
I stole to fill my stomach,
cheated to survive...

1426
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:54,360
because that's what my world taught me.

1427
02:21:56,720 --> 02:22:00,400
A family, a sister...

1428
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:07,040
a brother or a sister-in-law,
I've never known these relations.

1429
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:13,400
After living with you for
a few days, for the first time,

1430
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:15,320
I felt I was human too.

1431
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:19,520
Apart from strength,
there's a heart in the body.

1432
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,320
And the heart told me...

1433
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,480
Babu, these people are like you.

1434
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:30,920
Don't deceive them.

1435
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:38,800
You have given me a new form, a new life.

1436
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:41,400
I can never forget that.

1437
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:46,160
I must say this,

1438
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:51,000
whether Babu survives or not...

1439
02:22:52,120 --> 02:22:54,920
your husband will live.

1440
02:22:56,600 --> 02:23:00,560
I promise your love will live.

1441
02:23:27,240 --> 02:23:31,680
There's only one way to get in.
You wait here. I'll be back.

1442
02:24:11,320 --> 02:24:13,640
Your job is done. Seema is dead.

1443
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:17,120
Now you may send Ravi
back to his right place.

1444
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:24,360
Ravi is in his right place now.

1445
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:28,960
Not only Ravi,
your right place is here too.

1446
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:32,120
What do you mean?

1447
02:24:33,320 --> 02:24:35,400
Do you think I'm a fool?

1448
02:24:36,280 --> 02:24:39,800
If I can send you in Ravi's place...

1449
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:43,200
Can't I send somebody
to keep an eye on you?

1450
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:50,600
Now your life and Ravi's
will end right here.

1451
02:25:18,920 --> 02:25:19,920
Turn around.

1452
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,520
Get him and Ravi upstairs.

1453
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:11,560
Just a minute! Hold it!

1454
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:16,680
Don't kill me, it's not my fault.
I don't know them!

1455
02:26:16,840 --> 02:26:19,480
He brought me here. Don't kill me!

1456
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:24,560
I know nothing.
I don't want to die!

1457
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,000
It's not my fault...

1458
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:01,280
Stop!

1459
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:03,880
Nobody will touch him!

1460
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:06,560
He's my prey.

1461
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:13,560
Promise me, you won't intervene.

1462
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:16,480
No matter what.

1463
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:21,640
Come on.

1464
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:36,200
One for all... all for one!

1465
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:41,080
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1466
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:45,480
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1467
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:50,080
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1468
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,440
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1469
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:57,280
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1470
02:28:57,480 --> 02:29:01,160
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1471
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:04,520
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1472
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:08,280
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1473
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:11,600
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1474
02:29:12,280 --> 02:29:15,400
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1475
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,160
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1476
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:21,040
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1477
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:23,880
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1478
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:26,200
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1479
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:29,080
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1480
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,880
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1481
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:40,040
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1482
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:51,040
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1483
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:57,720
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1484
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:03,720
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1485
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:11,480
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1486
02:30:14,720 --> 02:30:21,040
-One for all... all for one!
-One for all... all for one!

1487
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,360
-Yes!
-Fantastic!

1488
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:39,520
Are you leaving?

1489
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:45,480
-Why?
-I've fulfilled my duty.

1490
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:49,480
Take care of yourself.

1491
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:55,880
If you've some respect
for me in your heart...

1492
02:31:56,520 --> 02:31:58,360
never sit on this chair again.

1493
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:01,880
Get up.

1494
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:05,360
I say, get up.

1495
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:13,000
No, I believed that my life
had finally turned around.

1496
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:15,400
And I was happy.

1497
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:20,080
But now I feel that it was all a lie.

1498
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:27,920
I think I am destined to
be in this chair forever!

1499
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:41,560
Get up!

1500
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:20,160
<span style="style.center_1">Come into my arms, my love!</span>
