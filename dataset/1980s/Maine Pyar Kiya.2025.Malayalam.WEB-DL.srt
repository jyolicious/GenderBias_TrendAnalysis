1
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,542
- Bro...
- What's it?

2
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:26,292
- Bro, can we get a room?
- No rooms available.

3
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:29,042
Somebody booked all
the rooms for one week.

4
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,209
Bro, we're really tired.

5
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,459
We can't find a room anywhere.
Give us just any room.

6
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,876
Hey! I already told you!

7
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,834
Please, bro! Just for one night.

8
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:37,959
We'll pay you extra.

9
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,417
Call him.

10
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,209
Reached Madurai?

11
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,375
Yes, bro.

12
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,500
We're near to Mellore.

13
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:52,042
The newspaper will
arrive by 4 or 4:30.

14
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,584
Take a photo and send it.

15
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:54,626
Okay?

16
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,542
Hey, vacate by noon.
The person who booked will be here.

17
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,292
Bro, today's newspaper.

18
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,876
- Hello?
- We'll meet at 8 PM tonight.

19
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,959
- I'll tell you the location later. Okay?
- Okay, bro.

20
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,417
I called Maari but
he didn't pick up.

21
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:35,792
Palani is waiting for
some Kerala gang.

22
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,250
That's why he's late.

23
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:47,834
You sit here.

24
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,542
Get out.

25
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:58,042
Hey, you brought this whole crowd
just for a bunch of kids?

26
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,709
Greetings, bro.

27
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,667
Haven't seen you around before.

28
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,334
Are you new to the field?

29
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,334
First time in Madurai, bro.

30
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,709
But we have plenty of clients in
Trichy, Pudukkottai, and Dindigul.

31
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:14,500
Hmm...

32
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,250
How old?

33
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,417
14 months?

34
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,709
Hmm...

35
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:21,709
Can I see the item?

36
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,000
Sure, but you need to
show the money first.

37
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,209
What?

38
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,375
Say that again!

39
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,042
The money's my responsibility.

40
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:35,250
I won't cheat you,
now show me the item first.

41
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:38,626
Althaf!

42
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,626
The item's safe.

43
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,792
But we'll hand it over
only after you settle the money.

44
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,584
This is Kalidasan's area.

45
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,584
We're with him.

46
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,542
His son, Maari.

47
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,125
Ever since he came back to town,
everything's gone downhill.

48
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,375
His dad died because of him.

49
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,083
That guy is a real psycho.

50
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,042
His father had an enemy...

51
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,083
Ramana.

52
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,542
A hot-tempered guy.

53
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:29,000
A worthy rival.

54
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,167
He could bring down anyone alone.

55
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,167
He didn't even know what fear was.

56
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,167
The whole town
trembled at his name.

57
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:39,000
But Maari burned Ramana's
family to ashes.

58
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,959
Now he acts like a
decent man and

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,667
tells me not to file a
case or go to court.

60
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,751
Why should we listen to him?

61
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,292
Who does he think we are, his slaves?

62
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:47,918
Don't we need money?

63
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,167
Of course we do!

64
00:06:49,584 --> 00:06:50,751
Don't we?

65
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:52,834
That's why we're doing this

66
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:54,083
snake,

67
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:55,876
tortoise

68
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,792
and rat business.

69
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,125
Even if one of these go missing,

70
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,042
you can't go and file a case
in court, can you?

71
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,125
Right?

72
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,083
Get out!

73
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,125
Come on!

74
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,375
Hey! Hey!

75
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,792
Why are you beating the kid?

76
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,000
Ask him nicely.

77
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:17,834
Poor kid.

78
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,584
Go on!
Go and get it.

79
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,292
What are you glaring at?

80
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,334
Please, bro...

81
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,709
Don't hurt us.

82
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,834
Maari's ass!

83
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,292
Hey, get in.

84
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:45,667
Who's that?

85
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,334
Tell me!

86
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,500
It's a rubber snake.

87
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,709
You thought we came to fool around
in Madurai, huh?

88
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,584
- Move!
- How dare you talk!

89
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,500
- Let him go!
- Feeling like a mass hero, huh?

90
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,209
Go on, say another mass dialogue.

91
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,959
Althaf! Grab everything!

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,209
Give it! Hand it over!

93
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,667
- Come on, give it!
- Give it here!

94
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,792
Give it to me!

95
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,500
Get it, man!

96
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:17,792
Move!

97
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,209
Hey!

98
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,876
Catch him!

99
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,042
Hey, hey!

100
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:42,250
Why do you need all
this decoration, huh?

101
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:49,375
Alright, then!

102
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,000
Hey!

103
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:52,709
Here's the magazine!

104
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:54,834
- Grab them!
- Manish...

105
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:55,918
Run!

106
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,667
Come on!

107
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,792
Catch them!

108
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:01,876
Go!

109
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,542
Bro! Bro!

110
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:05,834
Bro! Come on, carry him!

111
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,250
Get in, fast!

112
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,626
Quickly start the car! Get in! Get in!

113
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:11,959
Don't let them go!

114
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,292
Go and catch them!

115
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,876
- Bro...
- Careful, man!

116
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,167
Bro... Bro...

117
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:18,042
Quick, quick!

118
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,042
Speed up!

119
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,042
Step on it!

120
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,125
Move it!

121
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,918
Fire up the engine!
They're behind us!

122
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,542
Get out and run, Althaf!

123
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:13,584
Run!

124
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,584
They've escaped!

125
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,250
Run! Faster, faster!

126
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,334
Just shoot him!

127
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,042
I fired all three bullets we had!

128
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,626
What will I shoot with?

129
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:37,417
Hey!

130
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,584
Did you find those boys?

131
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:40,959
No, we're still searching, bro.

132
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:47,125
Chop off the arms and legs of those
three Malayali boys, piece by piece.

133
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,167
When Palani opens his eyes,
it should all be laid out in front of him.

134
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,959
If he dies before that,

135
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:55,500
throw the pieces to the hunting dogs

136
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:58,250
before they light his pyre.

137
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,250
Get going!

138
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,417
They're over here! Come on!

139
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,876
"June melts into July"

140
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,584
"If you leave me, I have Julie"

141
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,209
"It hurts, yet brings a
strange sense of joy"

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,667
"Once love is gone, it's gone for good"

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,459
"No need of assurances"

144
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,167
"It's tough, yes, even a bit cliché"

145
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,334
"Hakuna matata"

146
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,292
"Let's eat, drink, keep on living"

147
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,209
"We're always so high"

148
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,250
"I'm a lonely Dzouza"

149
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:28,209
"Can't even blink my eyes"

150
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,209
"It's an unknotted knot"

151
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,167
"Can't bow down to others"

152
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,542
"Everybody's so jealous of me"

153
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm leaving, Mom.

154
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,542
Do you realise
your dad's getting older?

155
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:40,959
Well Dad also should realise that.

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,167
Even studying, you couldn't manage.

157
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:45,417
Told you to find a job
and you won't even do that.

158
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:46,500
How would you?

159
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:47,876
You're not even scared of your father.

160
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:50,542
She's yelling at me thanks to you.
Go find a job, man!

161
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:10,751
"It's nothing but the echo of a big bang"

162
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,500
"Slice it up, fry it down"

163
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:16,417
"In different sizes"

164
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:18,667
"It's a great cult, boom boom!"

165
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,417
"Our troubles vanish in a game of football"

166
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,459
"Sorrows glowing brighter, set alight"

167
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:28,417
"O dear, it's my turn
My days shine in light"

168
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,209
"Though my nights burn in
sorrows and pain"

169
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,834
"I've tasted it all by now"

170
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:39,667
"My doomed fate
feeds on cheap fish"

171
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:44,209
"The road of life sparkles with promise"

172
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,959
Yet I can't bear the weight anymore.

173
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,209
Are you really going to marry her?

174
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,876
What kinda question is that?

175
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,667
- Hard to tell with you.
- Huh?

176
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,918
People say you went to Canada,
married some girl

177
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,167
and even have a kid now.

178
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:02,125
People in this town are nuts.

179
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:03,542
To be honest,

180
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:06,876
I only learned what love is
after she came into my life.

181
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,834
"June melts into July"

182
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:11,792
"If you leave me, I have Julie"

183
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:14,918
"It hurts, yet brings a
strange sense of joy"

184
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,834
"Once love is gone,
it's gone for good"

185
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:19,626
"No need of assurances"

186
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,584
"It's tough, yes, even
a bit cliché"

187
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:25,500
"Hakuna matata"

188
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:27,500
"Let's eat, drink, keep on living"

189
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:29,417
"We're always so high"

190
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,375
"I'm a lonely Dzouza"

191
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,375
"Can't even blink my eyes"

192
00:14:33,417 --> 00:14:35,375
"It's an unknotted knot"

193
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,334
"Can't bow down to others"

194
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,500
"Everybody's so jealous of me"

195
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:55,417
Aparna went to Germany?

196
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,792
Eh?! Did she?

197
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:58,417
Mm-hmm...

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No limits.

199
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,209
A flying bird!

200
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,626
By the way...

201
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:08,209
weren't you in love with
Balan sir's daughter?

202
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,417
What happened to that?

203
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,626
Don't you know?

204
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,792
They both were in a relationship
from 5th to 12th grade.

205
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,918
Only two people in Unnikulam
didn't know about that relationship.

206
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,667
One was you and the other was her.

207
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:21,042
How come?

208
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,125
I didn't want her to know.

209
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,918
Oh, please! Not because you don't
have the guts to tell her you love her.

210
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:27,250
Don't have to make
it such a big deal.

211
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:32,959
The moment we feel a girl is ours,
courage just starts flowing through us.

212
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:36,375
And then, it turns into a flood...
one that carries us away with it.

213
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:57,918
Come here, here...

214
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,000
Mark that player.

215
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,209
Stand closer.

216
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,876
Just fix that cooler for us.

217
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,292
We can have chilled beer from time to time.

218
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:04,375
- Hey, you!
- Eh?

219
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,500
Get off that phone!

220
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,417
It's about the car, let me speak, man!

221
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,375
Keep that phone away, man!
I'll call you back.

222
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,292
I'll call you right back.
You guys will see!

223
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:12,792
Is he ever going to buy a car?

224
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:13,834
Who knows?

225
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,500
Shine, get him!

226
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,626
- Hand, hand!
- No. No, no!

227
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,918
- Didn't you see?
- It didn't touch.

228
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,542
- It touched his hand.
- Thank to you jokers and your foul play

229
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:26,083
whenever we play,
we lose in the first round itself!

230
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,375
Neither your strategy nor
your game works.

231
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,709
To top it, a stupid captain!

232
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,209
If this is how it is,

233
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,626
my Benz Electronics and I
have pulled out of this sponsorship.

234
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,417
First, learn to respect
the captain's strategy.

235
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,167
That's why we come back
with empty goal buckets every time!

236
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,876
If you can't respect his strategy,
don't play.

237
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,375
You switched teams for banana fritters!

238
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,250
- What's happening here?
- I don't know, man.

239
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,751
What a messy team! Come with me!

240
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:48,000
Our stock market thing, right?

241
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:49,876
It was a fraud app, man.

242
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:52,167
- It's gone...
- 50000 rupees gone, huh?

243
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:53,834
But good thing we lost it.

244
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:55,417
- Eh?
- Not like that.

245
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,709
We'll go to Switzerland.

246
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:59,042
There, it's six months of work
and six months off.

247
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,834
Did you see this in some reel content?

248
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,792
No, man. We go to Switzerland.

249
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,500
It snows there for six months

250
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,167
and at that time, we'll clear
the snow off the highways.

251
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,751
Then it's summer there
for six months.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,250
So, no work.

253
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,459
We get a salary equivalent
to 3–4 lakh rupees.

254
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,417
Then we come back here on
leave and have a blast!

255
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,667
Just think about it.

256
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,083
Putting up posts and stories on Instagram.

257
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,584
I don't have my 10th or 12th certificates.

258
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,334
They're all at the college.

259
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,542
Let us just apply and keep.

260
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,584
Only when we get an appointment,
we'll need the certificates.

261
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:31,709
Don't think that'll work out.

262
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,209
We've got 4–5 days.

263
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,667
Now go and get it from your college.

264
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,709
Go!

265
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:37,542
- Hey...
- What's up?

266
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:39,042
Tell me the truth.

267
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,876
Is my captaincy that pathetic?

268
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,667
Do you think there's a better
player than you here?

269
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:43,500
Nope.

270
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,542
Do you think there's a better coach
or manager than you?

271
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:46,918
Tell me, do you think?

272
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,250
You know Pep Guardiola?

273
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,584
You should've been a bigger manager
than Pep Guardiola.

274
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:52,417
- But you got stuck in Unnikulam.
- That's right!

275
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:53,876
Go and tell them that.

276
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

277
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,083
Wonder which one is this Guardiola?

278
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:58,417
Sir...

279
00:17:58,459 --> 00:17:59,918
It has been so long...

280
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,417
Please forgive...

281
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,459
And forget...

282
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,000
No matter how many years pass,

283
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,667
I'll never forget you.

284
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,167
Come on, sir. He's just a kid.
Just hand it over and let him go.

285
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,209
Who are you?

286
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:10,918
- Me?!
- Yes, you!

287
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:15,751
I am the captain cum manager
of Athletico Unnikulam.

288
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:20,167
I myself came here, skipping practice
because he's our marquee player.

289
00:18:20,459 --> 00:18:22,751
He studied at this college
for only three months.

290
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:26,500
But the damage he caused
in those three months was massive.

291
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,876
Unless he makes up for that damage,
I won't give back the certificate.

292
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,334
So, why don't the manager
and his star player get going?

293
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,125
Sir...

294
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,250
Please, sir...

295
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,042
Go on!

296
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,751
Shall I just thrash him?

297
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,542
Shush! Stop it!

298
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:45,918
Wait...

299
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,125
Tell the truth,
did you steal anything from here?

300
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,292
Get lost!
What could I possibly steal from here?

301
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,292
He's asking for 3 lakhs as compensation

302
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,918
for the fight with the seniors.

303
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,375
Three lakh rupees?!

304
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,918
What a pain!

305
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,417
Call Nixon and tell him
we need his car's spare key.

306
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,209
Hm?

307
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,918
Gotta do something.

308
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,209
There is!

309
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,626
Come... come on!

310
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,125
Sir, this car is worth
30 lakh rupees.

311
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,209
You can keep this key
as a token of trust.

312
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,584
Please give me those certificates, sir.

313
00:19:17,626 --> 00:19:18,959
I need to take photocopies.

314
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,792
It's to apply for a job, sir.

315
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:22,709
Please, sir.

316
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,375
Sir?

317
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,334
His original certificates
are here in the office.

318
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,375
Will check, sir.

319
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:33,000
He wants photocopies
to apply for a job.

320
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,500
Find it and give it to him.

321
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,959
Admission number?

322
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:39,834
- Listen...
- Yes?

323
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:41,542
Where did you say your car was?

324
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,584
Downstairs, sir.

325
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:43,918
Do one thing.

326
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,417
- Take this key when you go.
- Okay.

327
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,209
And arrange for someone else in
the office to give him the certificates.

328
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,000
- Okay, sir.
- And you sit in that car yourself.

329
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,209
Get out of the car only after he
returns those certificates in the office.

330
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,375
Okay, sir.

331
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,918
Plan flopped. It won't work!
Let's go.

332
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,042
What do we do?

333
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,292
How about we bring your dad?

334
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,083
There's no point.
Either I bring 3 lakh rupees

335
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,626
or I forget about those certificates.

336
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,792
What ill-fated time
did I join this college?

337
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,334
Bro, come with me!

338
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,751
- Where to?
- Come, come!

339
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,459
Don't pull me! I'm coming!

340
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,292
That one won't work out for you.

341
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:44,500
Come...

342
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,292
Hey.

343
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,292
Come here.

344
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,334
Hi...

345
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,042
Dude, what's her name?

346
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,417
Oh! Nidhi.

347
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,500
Nice...

348
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,792
She's not a Malayali, bro. She's Tamilian.

349
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,000
Tamilian?

350
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,250
Tamilian...?

351
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:26,626
Don't fall for her, okay?
It's not going to work out.

352
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,250
Anyway, he's good for nothing...

353
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:29,292
Oh, no... Teacher!

354
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,334
Run!

355
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,083
Bro...

356
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,000
Ah!

357
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,876
I didn't believe
what you said the other day,

358
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:37,042
but you really are awesome!

359
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,584
What's it? Tell me the matter.

360
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:40,042
You told me the other day about how

361
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,042
the moment we see a girl and
feel she is ours,

362
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,250
that feeling…

363
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:45,167
- Mm-hmm...
- I felt it today, bro!

364
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:47,834
- Really?
- I was just flowing...

365
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,459
That girl is from Tamil Nadu.

366
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,792
Language isn't a problem...

367
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,042
Do you know Tamil?

368
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:56,667
I do... I know enough...

369
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:57,751
Really?

370
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:01,417
Friends who live in my heart,
my dear friends.

371
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,751
Vijay bro is my life!

372
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,167
You still haven't said a word to her,
have you?

373
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:07,250
Nah.

374
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,834
Describe her to me.

375
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:10,459
How are her eyes?

376
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:12,876
Round eyes.

377
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:13,918
Nose?

378
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,125
Sharp nose.

379
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,334
Pointy chin, right?

380
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,375
Yes.

381
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,459
It's going to be hard.

382
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:24,000
These kinds of girls are super bold.

383
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,042
But they're also drawn to guys
who are bold.

384
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,626
The moment you see her...

385
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,167
just propose.

386
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,834
- Do you think I'm bold enough to do that?
- Tea?

387
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:39,292
No, thanks.

388
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:42,083
Come on, we'll sort it out.

389
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:46,292
There's a chance
she could be in a relationship.

390
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:49,167
Or she's already got
tons of guys after her.

391
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:52,167
When love hits,
don't hold back, just say it.

392
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,375
It's out of respect for them.

393
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:57,292
And if they don't get it,
we should just tell them to beat it.

394
00:22:58,584 --> 00:23:01,083
Love is not for the faint-hearted!

395
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:05,792
You said she's a Tamilian, right?

396
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,417
That's where all the romance happens!

397
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:13,459
Gautham Menon, AR Rahman,
Ilaiyaraaja, Mani Ratnam.

398
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,959
Watch their films, then go for it!

399
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,375
You'll nail it!

400
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:18,667
Okay.

401
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,000
Can Aryan do it?

402
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:54,167
Both legs aimed at those eyes!

403
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,250
The heartbeat races just for him.

404
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:59,876
Only 10 metres left for Aryan Vishwam
to seal the win!

405
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:03,959
Excuse me.

406
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:10,918
Sha...

407
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,542
I don't love you but...

408
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,375
Hi Sha... Ahem...

409
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,042
Hi Nidhi.

410
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:20,264
If you don't mind

411
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,729
I don't love you.

412
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:23,270
I don't think you're beautiful.

413
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:26,802
But I'm scared all that might happen.

414
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,568
Think it through and let me know.

415
00:24:31,593 --> 00:24:32,676
Bye, then.

416
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:33,951
Thank you, sir.

417
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:43,696
A rainbow from Madurai
lights up the blue skies of Unnikulam!

418
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:45,696
Aryan, once a coward in love,

419
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,904
now charges forward with courage
to claim victory!

420
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,237
YAY!

421
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:51,988
Yes!!!

422
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,279
What the hell, man?

423
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:55,612
Correct.

424
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:58,570
When she sees you tomorrow,
she'll be stunned all over again.

425
00:24:58,612 --> 00:25:02,487
Since you got a yellow card,
stay away from her class, okay?

426
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,988
Go into defence mode.

427
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:16,904
Hi Nidhi.

428
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:18,862
I am Aryan.

429
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:22,320
Let's look at the next question.

430
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:30,195
And I don't need a doctor.

431
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,237
I need some oxygen.

432
00:25:34,237 --> 00:25:37,404
Sho... I can't even sit...

433
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,404
Nidhi...

434
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:40,696
I am in love with you.

435
00:25:40,737 --> 00:25:42,404
Don't take it lightly.

436
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,821
Ever since I met you...

437
00:25:44,946 --> 00:25:46,654
Pounding heartbeat...

438
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:49,445
Just like when my dad saw my mother.

439
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:50,654
Same feel...

440
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:52,070
Something wrong...

441
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:53,320
Ah!

442
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:54,904
How do I say this...

443
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,153
Everything in just a second...

444
00:25:58,153 --> 00:25:59,654
I am in love with you, Nidhi.

445
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:02,070
What's going on?

446
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,029
I love you.

447
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,779
It's not love.
It's obsession.

448
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,112
Why bring me into this?

449
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,737
I mean... I... I... love you...

450
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,570
You think you can come
into someone's life

451
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,570
by talking movie dialogues
and impress them?

452
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:15,404
It's not right.

453
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:21,029
Uh-oh!

454
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:24,570
Only Tamil movie dialogues, huh?

455
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,654
You think she'd fall for it
if it was Malayalam?

456
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:28,362
I doubt she'd understand.

457
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:31,487
But now she knows
you're a total goner.

458
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:34,487
If I'd studied CBSE,

459
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:36,654
my English would shoot like bullets.

460
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,445
Did you notice something?

461
00:26:38,821 --> 00:26:41,737
She looked at your face
for 40 seconds straight and talked to you

462
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:44,362
And your "I love you"!

463
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,237
It really packed a punch!

464
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,320
Yeah, man!

465
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,654
Seriously!

466
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:50,404
She's yours!

467
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:35,654
Niju! Put petrol in the bike and go home.
I'll catch up.

468
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,112
Here, here! Right here!

469
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:40,862
Here?

470
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:42,070
Thank you, bro!

471
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:22,237
Hi.

472
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,821
What's your intention?

473
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,737
I am in love with you.

474
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,737
I've made it clear.
Please leave from here.

475
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:34,362
I want to... to...

476
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,487
That... tha... the...

477
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:39,029
Spit it out in Malayalam itself.
I can understand.

478
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:43,654
When I see you, it feels like
a band is playing in my heart.

479
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:44,904
Are you not normal?

480
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:46,029
Are you nuts?

481
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,612
Don't you ever think?

482
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:48,654
I do.

483
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,862
I only think about you.

484
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:52,779
You're standing in front of my house.

485
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:54,570
This is not love, it is harassment.

486
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:57,404
Can I ask you one thing?

487
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,946
Are you in any relationship?

488
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,237
Argh!

489
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,696
Just look at my fate.

490
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:05,988
I'm standing here
talking to an idiot like you.

491
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,904
Please just leave from here.

492
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:19,821
- Get out!
- Just one more thing, Nidhi.

493
00:29:19,862 --> 00:29:22,696
After chasing you so much
and if you're in another relationship,

494
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,737
I won't be able to bear it.

495
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:26,237
Get out, you!

496
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,029
Who are you?

497
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:38,237
I... I am...

498
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,821
Ask Nidhi, she'll tell you.

499
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,988
What?

500
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,445
Mom... just listen to me, Mom...

501
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:51,612
Who's that boy?

502
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:53,029
What's he doing here?

503
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:00,696
I'll call you later.

504
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:07,029
No matter who stands against us,
it won't affect us.

505
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,904
I just need to talk to your dad
and everything will be settled.

506
00:30:10,237 --> 00:30:13,404
You don't know my family the way I do!

507
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:17,237
Just stop crying, will you?

508
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:21,862
Argh!

509
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:30,904
Come.

510
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,279
Come on!

511
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:33,946
Got something to tell you.

512
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:35,821
Where is your house?

513
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:37,320
- Unnikulam...
- Unnikulam.

514
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:38,821
- What's your name?
- Aryan.

515
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:40,153
Aryan...

516
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,070
Idiot!

517
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:46,946
If I find out you even dare to
go after her again...

518
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,362
this won't be the worst you face.

519
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:49,445
Got it?

520
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:51,237
He's on the hunt for love.

521
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:58,570
Dude, everything was fine...

522
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,445
until you barged into her house like that.

523
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:02,320
That was very lame.
Isn't that right?

524
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:03,529
Barged into her house?

525
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,696
Yes.

526
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,029
Bro...

527
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:08,946
I chased Aparna for seven years.

528
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:13,487
You all laughed at me
because I never told her how I felt.

529
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:18,487
Ever since I saw her...

530
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:22,487
I can't eat... I can't sleep...

531
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:24,862
Listen... you focus on the game.

532
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:27,320
And fall in love with football instead.

533
00:31:28,362 --> 00:31:31,362
Tony bro, at least he tried
for a girl at this age

534
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:34,029
but you even at this age,

535
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:35,904
have you ever gone after a girl?

536
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:37,654
You won't understand the pain.

537
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,988
It's when I feel sad
that I go play as a guest.

538
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:42,362
I always knew it!

539
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:42,988
Right?

540
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:44,529
Incoming puke alert!

541
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,946
Use this.

542
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,153
A puke missile!

543
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:59,070
Where are those red peanuts from?

544
00:31:59,112 --> 00:32:00,946
He's got no manners.

545
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:06,153
Are you okay?

546
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:07,404
Okay, okay...

547
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:09,237
Bro...

548
00:32:11,654 --> 00:32:13,237
- When I saw her face...
- Hm?

549
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,696
Poor fellow...

550
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:17,487
I felt like whatever I did was wrong.

551
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:19,529
It wasn't wrong, dear... You were right!

552
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,821
- You were right!
- Dude...

553
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:22,821
Since you are feeling so bad...

554
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,904
have two more shots
and blackout completely!

555
00:32:24,946 --> 00:32:25,988
Shut up!

556
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,112
- What?
- Get lost!

557
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,279
You can't stand here and smoke.

558
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,779
Fine, I'll sit and smoke!
Get going, man!

559
00:32:29,821 --> 00:32:31,029
- Such guys!
- Sorry, bro!

560
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:40,862
Dear son, I'll never tell you not to drink.

561
00:32:40,904 --> 00:32:43,029
It's okay to have a drink
or two once in a while.

562
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,779
But don't drink to run away
from your problems.

563
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:47,737
That will only ruin your life.

564
00:32:48,112 --> 00:32:50,779
No matter what happens,
we have to face our problems head on.

565
00:32:50,821 --> 00:32:51,862
Okay?

566
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,070
Good morning.

567
00:32:55,612 --> 00:32:56,779
Nidhi.

568
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,237
I am sorry.

569
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,654
I don't even know who you are.

570
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,195
You embarrassed me in
front of my class.

571
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:13,737
Then you came to my
house and did the same.

572
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:15,821
I'm going for my exam now.

573
00:33:16,112 --> 00:33:18,988
I'm only talking to you so that you
don't come there and cause trouble.

574
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:28,529
Is it right to say you love a girl without
even respecting her personal space?

575
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,696
Don't behave like this.

576
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,654
Bye.

577
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:48,279
Nidhi.

578
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:49,904
Please let me talk.

579
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,195
What's it?

580
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:52,570
That is...

581
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:55,862
I studied in a boy's school
from 5th to 12th grade.

582
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,737
And because of that,

583
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:00,029
I'm not really familiar with love and all.

584
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:03,612
That's when I met a girl
in my tuition class and fell in love,

585
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:07,112
but I didn't even have the guts
back then to tell her.

586
00:34:07,153 --> 00:34:09,237
I was afraid this would
turn out like that too.

587
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,112
That's how I ended up doing all this.

588
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:13,195
Sorry.

589
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:14,445
It's alright.

590
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,153
Listen...

591
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,570
As an apology for all the trouble I caused,

592
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:21,737
can I buy you a coffee?

593
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:23,070
No, no. It's fine.

594
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:24,195
Listen...

595
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:29,070
At least to make up for the beatings
I took from your family...

596
00:34:29,654 --> 00:34:31,029
can I buy you a coffee?

597
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,237
Who beat you up?

598
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,279
If someone hit me
and told me not to talk to you,

599
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,237
it must've been your family, right?

600
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:42,821
Did you see a doctor?

601
00:34:42,862 --> 00:34:44,612
No... So...

602
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,779
my friends and I went to the bar,
had a few drinks and slept it off.

603
00:34:50,862 --> 00:34:51,988
By the way,

604
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:54,195
how long has it been
since you came to Kerala?

605
00:34:55,112 --> 00:34:56,612
It has been three years.

606
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,988
Oh?

607
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,362
My mother works as a superintendent
in the Railways.

608
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:04,029
You can speak Malayalam quite well.

609
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,821
I love Tamil

610
00:35:06,362 --> 00:35:08,029
Vijay bro is my life.

611
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,029
I watch every Vijay bro movie
at least five times.

612
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,529
I'm a die-hard fan.

613
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:20,279
I hope you won't just stay silent
the next time you see me.

614
00:35:20,362 --> 00:35:21,529
Right?

615
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,237
Let me be clear.

616
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:30,696
Anyone can tell someone
they love them.

617
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,612
That's your right.

618
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:34,904
And I have the freedom
to respond or not.

619
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:37,904
The reason I'm sitting here
with you, having coffee,

620
00:35:37,946 --> 00:35:39,570
is simply out of respect.

621
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:41,487
There's no extra meaning to it.

622
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:44,112
Even if you come after
me or talk to me,

623
00:35:44,153 --> 00:35:46,153
I won't feel anything for you.

624
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,237
You're just wasting your time.

625
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,612
My parents have had my whole life planned
since the day I was born,

626
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:53,904
where I'll study, what job I'll do,
who I'll marry

627
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,404
and even when I'll retire.

628
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,696
You're not even
an option for me.

629
00:35:57,904 --> 00:36:00,821
So please, don't come
and talk to me again.

630
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,153
Do you understand?

631
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,696
Or I can explain it in Malayalam.

632
00:36:13,195 --> 00:36:14,904
We're an orthodox family.

633
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:18,487
Me, my brother, my wife
and our extended family.

634
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,862
We have to discuss with everyone
before making a decision.

635
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,362
Mine's an orthodox family too.

636
00:36:23,404 --> 00:36:25,404
I can have my father talk to you.

637
00:36:25,821 --> 00:36:27,862
It's not going to happen, Nixon.

638
00:36:31,362 --> 00:36:33,737
You know I can't live without you, Nichu.

639
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:37,654
And I can't live as another man's wife
in this lifetime.

640
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:41,779
So, Nichu, find another girl
and live happily with her.

641
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:45,195
Let them suffer
seeing me live like this my whole life.

642
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,112
I was the one
who chased after you for love.

643
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,821
I won't let you suffer because of that.

644
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,195
Bro, think it over one more time
before you decide.

645
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:01,904
We can sort it out. Tell him, man!

646
00:37:01,946 --> 00:37:03,862
This isn't like going on a trip to Munnar.

647
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:05,195
Are you sure?

648
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:07,279
Shouldn't we at least
do something for love?

649
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:09,279
Bye, then.

650
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,862
Listen, don't give up
just because she said no.

651
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:13,946
Try harder!

652
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:15,237
She's your girl!

653
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:17,821
Also, I haven't told Suhana.

654
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,862
Let it be a surprise for her!

655
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,654
Not just her,
all of Unnikulam will be surprised.

656
00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:26,195
'SUPER FAST TO PONNANI'

657
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,654
This love is something else, right?

658
00:37:53,779 --> 00:37:54,946
- Excuse me.
- Hm?

659
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:56,821
May I speak with her for
a moment, please?

660
00:37:57,946 --> 00:37:59,029
Thank you.

661
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,570
Babe, I thought a lot.

662
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:06,445
And I've decided that
not talking to you is…

663
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:07,862
just so bad, so bad, babe!

664
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:08,988
Don't call me babe.

665
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:10,862
Babe... what I mean is...

666
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:13,445
I mean, babe--

667
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,029
I said don't call me babe!

668
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,529
What's your problem, huh?

669
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:22,029
Babe, when I first saw you...

670
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:25,529
it felt like I was transported to
another world!

671
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,195
I have a habit of drinking.

672
00:38:30,362 --> 00:38:34,779
My stupid brain keeps wondering
if you're in another relationship.

673
00:38:36,153 --> 00:38:38,195
I am so madly in love with you, babe.

674
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:39,737
I already told you, didn't I?

675
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:41,445
Don't come and talk to me!

676
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,612
Whatever you're thinking
is not going to happen.

677
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,362
You're just wasting your
time and energy.

678
00:38:45,404 --> 00:38:47,946
As it is, whatever I want never happens.

679
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,570
And time and energy…

680
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:52,320
I have plenty to waste.

681
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,904
But don't you worry about that.

682
00:38:53,946 --> 00:38:55,279
Just forget it, babe.

683
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:58,070
I just want to know...

684
00:38:58,362 --> 00:39:00,070
if you're in a relationship or not...

685
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:01,487
Is there a rule that if I'm single,

686
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:03,279
I have to fall for you?

687
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,946
No, nothing like that.

688
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:07,279
If you're not single,

689
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,362
I'll just say 'okay, bye' and walk away.

690
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:12,988
And you're the one
who makes the rules, babe.

691
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:14,654
Didn't I tell you not
to call me 'babe'?

692
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,570
What else can I call
you other than babe?

693
00:39:17,612 --> 00:39:20,779
You're like a baby
who only listens to her parents

694
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:24,487
and walks around
like an outdated version of herself?

695
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:28,570
What's your biggest wish in life?

696
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:30,821
That would be...

697
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,696
I want to go to Barcelona,

698
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,529
watch the Barcelona vs Real Madrid match
and have a blast.

699
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,404
Do you know what my wish is?

700
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:38,737
Hm?

701
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:42,029
I want to go to a hotel, sit by myself,
order and enjoy a meal.

702
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:45,570
I want to go to the beach at night
and stand in the water.

703
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:49,153
I want to go on a solo drive
to somewhere far away.

704
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:51,153
And before that,
I want to learn how to drive.

705
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:55,445
I want to have pani puri
from a roadside stall.

706
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:57,487
How can you even call these wishes?

707
00:39:58,821 --> 00:40:00,487
That is the difference
between you and me.

708
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,779
Listen... Babe...

709
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,821
This is why I said
you're an outdated version.

710
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:11,779
Narayani chechi's shop is 5 km away.

711
00:40:12,112 --> 00:40:15,362
I'll buy you special puttu steamed
in a coconut shell, with duck roast.

712
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:17,737
Pani puri is nothing next to that!

713
00:40:18,362 --> 00:40:20,029
Pani puri, it seems! What nonsense!

714
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:34,279
Bhel puri!

715
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,362
Pani puri!

716
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:36,654
Masala puri!

717
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:45,320
Those who've eaten, those
who want to eat

718
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,570
and those who've never eaten,
free puri for all!

719
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,946
Pani puri! Dahi puri! Sev puri!

720
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:55,279
Bhel puri! Masala puri! All puri! Free pu--

721
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,404
You!

722
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,862
- Sir...
- You think this campus is your playground?

723
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,153
It's about your certificates, right?

724
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:02,904
I've told the office.
You'll get it tomorrow.

725
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:05,320
Not even your shadow should fall
on this campus after that!

726
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,570
- Sorry, sir.
- Scram with your bhel puri, pani puri!

727
00:41:07,612 --> 00:41:08,654
Sorry.

728
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,185
[Indistinct chatters]

729
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,405
I can't unable to push.

730
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:16,704
Aryan!

731
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:17,771
Here she comes!

732
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,195
Why was the principal scolding you?

733
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:21,737
Oh, he wasn't scolding.

734
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,529
He sweetly said he'd return
my certificates he'd confiscated.

735
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:25,612
Nothing else.

736
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,654
- What?
- You go, I'll come.

737
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:29,237
Ah, okay. Bhai, let's go.

738
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,112
I had to go to that Bhai's house

739
00:41:31,153 --> 00:41:32,654
and play with his kid for five hours

740
00:41:32,696 --> 00:41:34,195
to get this stall here.

741
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,654
I thought you'd at least buy a pani puri.

742
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,320
Why go through all this effort?

743
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,821
This is no effort at all.

744
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:40,988
If I've to go Barcelona,

745
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:42,570
I'll need to buy a ticket, get a visa,

746
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:43,904
need money in my bank account...

747
00:41:43,946 --> 00:41:46,070
compared to that your wish is so simple.

748
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:48,946
We have to try and get it done.
Am I right?

749
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,904
Doesn't matter if it's Barcelona
or this stall.

750
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:54,112
It's a wish... Right?

751
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,153
A wish is a wish, after all.

752
00:41:56,195 --> 00:41:57,487
Alright, then. I'm off.

753
00:41:57,821 --> 00:41:58,904
Hey!

754
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:01,570
That day you said...

755
00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:03,779
About puttu and steam?

756
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:06,112
Where can I get that?

757
00:42:12,195 --> 00:42:13,570
Hey, dear... I am...

758
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:18,362
You take a bus and go home.

759
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,070
Something came up.

760
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:21,362
- Bus?!
- Yes.

761
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:10,279
"A thorn struck me,
Not my eyes, but deep in my soul"

762
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,404
"Splintering, my spirit falls apart"

763
00:43:15,404 --> 00:43:17,029
"Something shattered within"

764
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:29,612
"Blue waves roll up and kiss our feet"

765
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:35,029
"We're bound together
By a magician's unseen thread"

766
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,487
"Is my heart swimming in delight,"

767
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:39,737
"Or fluttering like a pigeon in a cage?"

768
00:43:40,654 --> 00:43:45,029
"Did a dragonfly drop a rock
On my chest?"

769
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:10,654
"Don't set my heart ablaze with desire"

770
00:44:10,696 --> 00:44:15,029
"Don't slay me with
Sharp, piercing glances"

771
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:18,153
"Don't shine too fiercely,
I might burn to ash"

772
00:44:18,195 --> 00:44:20,737
"Don't wilt, you're a delicate feather"

773
00:44:20,779 --> 00:44:25,404
"A gentle blossom,
Shaped from my very rib"

774
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:30,570
"Blue waves roll up
and kiss our feet"

775
00:44:31,153 --> 00:44:36,153
"We're bound together
By a magician's unseen thread"

776
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:41,237
"Is my heart swimming in delight,
Or fluttering like a pigeon in a cage?"

777
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:45,904
"Did a dragonfly drop a rock
On my chest?"

778
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,821
"A thorn struck me,
Not my eyes, but deep in my soul"

779
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:55,487
"Splintering, my spirit falls apart"

780
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,779
"Something shattered within"

781
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,029
Today was really nice.

782
00:45:16,279 --> 00:45:17,612
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

783
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:22,843
Can you give me your number?

784
00:45:22,868 --> 00:45:24,367
9994924-

785
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:26,612
- Shall I dial for you?
- Yes.

786
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:27,679
Yes, of course.

787
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,190
Lock.

788
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:44,506
- Hello?
- Is this Nidhi Sathyaprakash's guardian?

789
00:45:44,531 --> 00:45:46,970
- Yes.
- I'm calling from RMV College.

790
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:50,392
Ma'am, this coming Friday there's
a compulsory parent-teacher meeting.

791
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,892
There was a student strike against
the management in the college today.

792
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,249
And none of the students
have attended their classes.

793
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:58,774
No, no, she must be in the class only.

794
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:00,142
I'm sorry, ma'am.

795
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:02,478
- Please ensure you attend the meeting.
- Okay.

796
00:46:02,783 --> 00:46:04,140
Yes, we will attend.

797
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:05,612
Nidhi.

798
00:46:05,654 --> 00:46:07,237
Didn't you go to college today?

799
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:09,404
Why? What happened?

800
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:10,821
I got a call from your college.

801
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:12,529
Apparently, you didn't attend class?

802
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,487
You said you were late today
because of the extra class, right?

803
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:16,988
No... I did attend, Mom.

804
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:19,570
Hm... why this confusion?

805
00:46:20,029 --> 00:46:22,279
Friday there is a meeting in
the college, it seems.

806
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,445
Management said parents
must attend.

807
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:27,112
I'll call your dad right away
for the meeting.

808
00:46:27,153 --> 00:46:28,153
Okay.

809
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:36,904
Oh!

810
00:46:41,737 --> 00:46:42,821
Ha...

811
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:44,612
Hel...

812
00:46:46,279 --> 00:46:47,487
Hi Nidhi.

813
00:46:47,696 --> 00:46:49,029
I told a lie.

814
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:50,696
Huh?

815
00:46:50,737 --> 00:46:51,862
And now I'm in trouble.

816
00:46:51,904 --> 00:46:53,404
What's the problem, Nidhi?

817
00:46:53,445 --> 00:46:55,988
They called from college
because I didn't attend class.

818
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,570
There's a parent-teacher
meeting on Friday.

819
00:46:58,612 --> 00:46:59,821
My mom will come.

820
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:01,279
My dad will come too.

821
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,112
I'm going to be dead!

822
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,404
Don't worry! Just calm down.

823
00:47:05,445 --> 00:47:07,279
We'll talk it out and sort it, okay?

824
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,362
Our--

825
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,404
Argh!

826
00:47:40,737 --> 00:47:41,779
Hey!

827
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:42,821
Give me that phone.

828
00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:43,904
Just give it!

829
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:45,237
We'll sort it out right away.

830
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:51,362
- Hello.
- Hello Usha?

831
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:52,696
- Yes?
- It's me, Tony.

832
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:53,862
Tony, dear!

833
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,195
Why don't you call me
like you used to?

834
00:47:56,237 --> 00:47:57,237
Dude...

835
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:58,696
If her parents come to college,

836
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:00,696
she'll probably just get a punishment.

837
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:02,696
If you make him handle
this kind of responsibility,

838
00:48:02,737 --> 00:48:03,862
dismissal is guaranteed.

839
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,112
By the way, could you
do me a favour?

840
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:07,320
Of course!

841
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,153
- Hello?
- Hello.

842
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:19,696
Is this Nidhi Sathyaprakash's mother?

843
00:48:19,737 --> 00:48:20,737
Yes.

844
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,487
Nidhi.

845
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,070
Sorry, Nidhi.

846
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,529
It was nothing.

847
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,279
Looks like the college staff
called by mistake.

848
00:48:31,696 --> 00:48:33,029
Sorry, dear.

849
00:48:39,737 --> 00:48:40,904
Nidhi!

850
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:47,779
Hello, Aryan.

851
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:49,195
Thank you.

852
00:48:49,237 --> 00:48:50,445
Thank you so much.

853
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:52,862
Mom spoke very sweetly to me.

854
00:48:52,904 --> 00:48:54,529
I feel like there's someone

855
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,320
who'll help me if I
ever have a problem.

856
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,612
Aryan, I've a doubt...

857
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:00,612
Put her on speaker.

858
00:49:00,654 --> 00:49:03,445
Hope she won't find out
it was a fake call?

859
00:49:03,737 --> 00:49:05,612
Will Mom get a call again?

860
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:07,612
No, no.

861
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,153
No, no, she won't get any call.

862
00:49:10,195 --> 00:49:11,529
I've also got such calls

863
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,904
from college many times.

864
00:49:12,946 --> 00:49:14,237
Don't take it too seriously.

865
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:16,279
There won't be any more calls.

866
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:17,779
Thank you.

867
00:49:18,445 --> 00:49:19,737
Thank you so much.

868
00:49:20,112 --> 00:49:21,320
Okay.

869
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:22,696
Good night.

870
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:23,696
Good night.

871
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:24,904
Bye.

872
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,320
Bro! Thank you!

873
00:49:30,195 --> 00:49:31,821
You're so damn powerful!

874
00:49:32,029 --> 00:49:34,279
That number you called before,
just delete it.

875
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:50,029
Aha!

876
00:49:58,445 --> 00:49:59,779
Hey! Get in.

877
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:05,612
How's it?

878
00:50:06,779 --> 00:50:07,988
World class!

879
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:09,988
- Really?
- Of course!

880
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,029
- Shine! Come on, man!
- Get lost!

881
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:24,153
We need to go on a long drive with this car
and have a blast.

882
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:25,320
We shall!

883
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,445
Just amazing!

884
00:50:31,029 --> 00:50:32,904
Hey! Close it gently.

885
00:50:34,112 --> 00:50:35,320
Why are you so sad?

886
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:37,112
He didn't let me take the car for a spin.

887
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:38,821
But the car is right here, no?

888
00:50:38,862 --> 00:50:41,153
I don't think he'll get out of it
for at least a year.

889
00:50:41,195 --> 00:50:43,737
The family group is flooded with pictures
of Chachan's car.

890
00:50:44,821 --> 00:50:46,195
Goodnight, Tina.

891
00:50:46,237 --> 00:50:47,195
Okay.

892
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:49,112
Also, Shine... there's something...

893
00:50:49,612 --> 00:50:50,821
I'll tell you tomorrow.

894
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:53,779
Look at this.

895
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,153
I don't wanna see it!

896
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,737
- Dude!
- Dude...

897
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:02,153
He gave you the car?

898
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:03,445
Yes, I made it happen.

899
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:05,153
Where're you off to with the helmet?

900
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:07,988
I am off to collect my certificates
from college.

901
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:09,153
College?

902
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:10,821
She called me last night and was all...

903
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:12,320
I miss you... I love you...

904
00:51:12,988 --> 00:51:15,570
She said now there's someone
who looks after her.

905
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:17,862
I've got a feeling
this is gonna work out, dude.

906
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:20,237
Leave the bike and get in the car.

907
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:21,821
No, it's okay. I'll take the bike.

908
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:23,946
I haven't had a chance
to take this one for a spin.

909
00:51:23,988 --> 00:51:26,070
Let's go through MC Road
and fly this beast.

910
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:29,237
Let her know that you've
rich friends too.

911
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:30,904
Park it and come.

912
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:33,279
- Come on, quick!
- Alright, I will.

913
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,195
There's a mirror, you can comb your hair.

914
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:38,737
Nidhi.

915
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,487
Where were you yesterday?

916
00:51:40,696 --> 00:51:41,988
- You know Aryan, right?
- Yes.

917
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:44,696
I went out with him
and ate a lot of spicy food.

918
00:51:44,737 --> 00:51:45,696
Great!

919
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:47,904
I had gone to the staff room
to submit the draft.

920
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:50,195
They were discussing about you.

921
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:54,237
The management is already really angry
about calling the strike yesterday.

922
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,696
And on top of that,

923
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,487
the teachers were saying the students

924
00:51:57,529 --> 00:51:59,988
called the strike just to roam around
and take rooms.

925
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:01,487
Why did you make a fake call?

926
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:03,779
That fake call was the biggest problem.

927
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:07,279
The teachers have called your mom
to inform her about it.

928
00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:40,529
Stop, stop here!

929
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:43,946
Isn't that Mary's sister?
She's grown up so fast!

930
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:45,279
Who cares?

931
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,570
What do you mean?

932
00:52:46,612 --> 00:52:47,737
Huh!

933
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:49,279
Nidhi!

934
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,779
- What's happening?
- Can you start the car? Please.

935
00:52:51,821 --> 00:52:53,029
Please, please.

936
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:55,112
Start the car.
It's okay, we'll see.

937
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:56,279
We'll go now.

938
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,529
Go where?

939
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:03,237
This is my friend.

940
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:04,445
Shine.

941
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,112
Nidhi... what's it...

942
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,445
What happened?

943
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:22,029
Can you please stop that music?

944
00:53:33,195 --> 00:53:34,946
Chachan is calling me,
I need to go soon.

945
00:53:35,696 --> 00:53:37,320
- Look, he's calling.
- Just calm down!

946
00:53:40,153 --> 00:53:41,237
Ugh!

947
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:45,988
Chachan and Mom are
calling me non-stop.

948
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:48,404
I stepped out saying
I'll go bless the car and be right back.

949
00:53:48,445 --> 00:53:50,529
Tell me where to go, I'll drop you.

950
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,029
I'm going for a smoke,
be right back.

951
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:57,029
Do you have cigarettes?

952
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:58,195
Nidhi.

953
00:53:58,487 --> 00:53:59,862
What happened?

954
00:54:01,654 --> 00:54:03,404
I'll only know if you tell me.

955
00:54:04,612 --> 00:54:06,904
My family found out about the fake call.

956
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:10,153
They called the college
and informed Mom.

957
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,445
Oh, no...

958
00:54:11,487 --> 00:54:14,237
My mom is in college
for the parent-teacher meeting.

959
00:54:14,696 --> 00:54:17,070
I don't know how to face Mom.

960
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:18,946
I feel so ashamed.

961
00:54:19,737 --> 00:54:22,195
Oh, no... I don't know what to do...

962
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:24,988
Nidhi...

963
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:27,821
The blessing is over, Mom.
I'll light two candles and come.

964
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:29,862
Joy has been ready since morning.

965
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,404
Just make him understand, Mom.

966
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:33,112
Two have shown up early
in the morning to flirt.

967
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,862
I'm getting worried seeing you worried.

968
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,237
Please calm down.
We will figure something out.

969
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:40,237
- What are you doing in the car?
- Get out!

970
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:42,153
- Get out!
- What's it?

971
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,570
Wait a minute.
What is the problem?

972
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:45,029
- What were you doing?
- Brother...

973
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:46,570
Hang on! Wait a minute.

974
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:47,988
Just a minute... Let me speak.

975
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:49,029
You stop acting smart!

976
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:50,988
Stop pushing me! Just talk it out.
What's wrong?

977
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:53,904
Go get a room!
Don't create nuisance for people!

978
00:54:53,988 --> 00:54:54,988
Who are you--

979
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:56,153
Give your father's number.

980
00:54:56,195 --> 00:54:57,529
Give your parents' number.

981
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,529
- Why Dad's--
- Say it!

982
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:01,904
Hello.

983
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,279
We found your son and a girl
in a compromising situation in a car.

984
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,821
If you don't raise them properly,

985
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:08,445
the townsfolk will tear them apart.

986
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:09,821
Townsfolk will tear them apart?!

987
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:11,862
- Which bloody townsfolk, huh, you moron?
- Eh?

988
00:55:11,904 --> 00:55:15,529
We live in a democratic country
where we vote.

989
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:17,487
If something happens to my kids…

990
00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:19,737
bloody moral policing scumbags.

991
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:21,445
Hang up, you moron!

992
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:22,612
Get lost!

993
00:55:26,529 --> 00:55:27,696
Well, it is his dad after all.

994
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,737
Clearly, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

995
00:55:29,862 --> 00:55:31,320
Give me your father's number.

996
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:34,362
We already gave you the number.
Why are you simply creating an issue?

997
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:35,404
Move aside, you!

998
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:36,570
Who are you people?

999
00:55:36,612 --> 00:55:38,029
Move aside!

1000
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:40,565
95552

1001
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:43,320
- Bro...
- 626

1002
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,073
Hello.

1003
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:48,737
Oh, Tamil, huh?

1004
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,195
We found your daughter

1005
00:55:51,237 --> 00:55:53,320
and a guy in a compromising situation.

1006
00:55:53,404 --> 00:55:54,529
This is the last warning.

1007
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:55,988
You'd better advise your daughter.

1008
00:55:56,029 --> 00:55:57,862
We better not see them
around here again.

1009
00:55:58,237 --> 00:55:59,320
Hey, hey!

1010
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:01,570
You dare wear those Kunnamkulam crocs
and step on a 15-lakh car?

1011
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:02,696
Move your damn feet!

1012
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:04,821
- Shine, don't... don't...
- Who the hell are you, huh?

1013
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,737
Who are you, huh?

1014
00:56:08,153 --> 00:56:09,195
Who the hell are you guys?

1015
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:10,737
Move! Shine...

1016
00:56:12,612 --> 00:56:13,696
His bloody...

1017
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:14,696
Oh, no!

1018
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:17,404
Get the hell out of here
with your damn car!

1019
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,029
I said get going!

1020
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:21,153
Get inside the car.

1021
00:56:21,696 --> 00:56:23,988
Was this car part of your
dad's dowry, you pig?

1022
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:25,862
- It hasn't even been blessed yet!
- Move away!

1023
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:27,988
- Who are these jerks?
- Get inside the car!

1024
00:56:28,029 --> 00:56:29,487
I know how to get into my car, man!

1025
00:56:29,529 --> 00:56:30,529
Get going!

1026
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:31,904
We're going, man!

1027
00:56:32,904 --> 00:56:34,195
Don't dare come here again!

1028
00:56:55,654 --> 00:56:57,320
Dude, where are you?

1029
00:56:57,737 --> 00:56:59,070
Is Nidhi with you?

1030
00:56:59,237 --> 00:57:00,279
What's the problem?

1031
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,737
It's a huge issue in college now.

1032
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:02,988
Nidhi's parents are here.

1033
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:04,821
Apparently, she ran away with someone.

1034
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,946
They're heading to the police station.

1035
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:09,070
And they're saying it's you.

1036
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,988
Tell me the truth.
Is she with you?

1037
00:57:14,112 --> 00:57:15,654
I'll call you back, okay? I'll call.

1038
00:57:23,696 --> 00:57:24,988
Haven't they had enough?

1039
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:27,112
Didn't you get enough?

1040
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,112
Use her to the maximum!

1041
00:57:29,153 --> 00:57:30,279
We're leaving, bro! We are!

1042
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,279
- Shine!
- Go quickly!

1043
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,529
Get going!

1044
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:39,779
Shine...

1045
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:41,195
What are you doing?

1046
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,821
Sir, this guy had intruded
into our house once.

1047
00:57:49,654 --> 00:57:51,362
I let him off with a warning.

1048
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:54,404
I suspect he's under the influence of
weed or drugs.

1049
00:57:55,195 --> 00:57:56,737
Reduce the speed, Shine!

1050
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:58,487
- Be quiet!
- Calm down, dude.

1051
00:58:04,237 --> 00:58:05,821
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

1052
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,237
- Is this Chandran?
- Yes.

1053
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:09,362
I'm calling from
Chooravattom police station.

1054
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:11,404
- What's this regarding, sir?
- Isn't Aryan your son?

1055
00:58:11,445 --> 00:58:13,988
- -Yes.
- We've got a complaint against his name.

1056
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:14,988
What complaint?

1057
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,404
He has kidnapped a girl called Nidhi.

1058
00:58:17,445 --> 00:58:19,862
We tried calling their number
but it is switched off.

1059
00:58:19,904 --> 00:58:21,612
You will need to come to the station.

1060
00:58:21,988 --> 00:58:23,904
- I'll come.
- Don't be late.

1061
00:58:24,612 --> 00:58:26,029
- Okay, sir.
- Okay.

1062
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:29,279
Joy!

1063
00:58:33,487 --> 00:58:35,112
Dude, just switch it off.

1064
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:36,696
He keeps calling.

1065
00:58:36,737 --> 00:58:38,237
- Who?
- Chachan!

1066
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:47,779
- Joy!
- Yes.

1067
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:49,779
His phone is switched off now.

1068
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:51,904
Idiot took my car and went!

1069
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,112
Why are you staring at the road
so early in the morning, Mary?

1070
00:58:55,153 --> 00:58:56,654
What happened?

1071
00:58:56,696 --> 00:58:59,737
Shine left early in the morning
with the car to bless it.

1072
00:59:00,029 --> 00:59:02,320
His phone was ringing just a while ago.

1073
00:59:02,362 --> 00:59:03,946
Now it says it's switched off.

1074
00:59:04,153 --> 00:59:05,862
So sad, Joy bought a car

1075
00:59:05,904 --> 00:59:07,529
and can't even use it himself.

1076
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:09,029
What about his course?

1077
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,029
He's saying he doesn't want to
do that course.

1078
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:13,195
He's saying he'll do some other course.

1079
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,988
I feel some peace
thinking about Aryan now.

1080
00:59:16,029 --> 00:59:18,320
He's saying he wants to work,
go abroad and all.

1081
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,320
He went to college to meet the principal
and get his certificates.

1082
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:22,445
It's such a relief.

1083
00:59:22,487 --> 00:59:23,570
Hey!

1084
00:59:24,195 --> 00:59:25,237
How come you're here?

1085
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:27,279
- Go and get the car keys.
- Why?

1086
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,529
Need to go to the police station.

1087
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,195
Apparently, Aryan has kidnapped a girl.

1088
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,320
A girl?!

1089
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:33,320
- I'll be there soon.
- Oh, dear goodness!

1090
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:39,153
I always told you
not to spoil these kids too much!

1091
00:59:39,195 --> 00:59:40,070
What happened?

1092
00:59:40,112 --> 00:59:42,529
- Aryan ran away with some girl.
- I knew this would happen!

1093
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:44,654
Shine took the car early morning.

1094
00:59:44,988 --> 00:59:47,237
He's not back yet
and his phone is switched off too.

1095
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:51,070
- Joy!
- Yes.

1096
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:53,821
I'll go get ready and come.
We need to go to the police station.

1097
00:59:56,654 --> 00:59:57,821
- Listen...
- Hm?

1098
00:59:57,862 --> 00:59:59,279
The petrol tank is almost empty.

1099
00:59:59,821 --> 01:00:01,862
Brand new car
and the petrol's already over?

1100
01:00:01,904 --> 01:00:03,904
Chachan said the
Unnikulam pump has dirty fuel,

1101
01:00:03,988 --> 01:00:05,862
so he wanted to go to town to fill up.

1102
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,195
What a pain!

1103
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:09,904
How much cash do you have with you?

1104
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:12,195
Less than 100.

1105
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:15,029
Pull over to the side somewhere.

1106
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:16,529
I won't need to pull over.

1107
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,946
It stopped.

1108
01:00:17,988 --> 01:00:19,737
Get out and push,
I'll steer it to the side.

1109
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,946
- What a task!
- Get out and push!

1110
01:00:31,237 --> 01:00:32,445
I'm at the station now.

1111
01:00:32,737 --> 01:00:34,029
I've filed a written complaint.

1112
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:36,362
We are investigating in our own way.

1113
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:38,946
I had given him a good thrashing before.

1114
01:00:39,195 --> 01:00:40,946
He's such a total loser.

1115
01:00:43,195 --> 01:00:45,029
Where did you find this crazy girl?

1116
01:00:45,404 --> 01:00:46,445
Dude...

1117
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:49,570
What terrible timing on my part
to take you into the car!

1118
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,153
I told you I'll take my bike!

1119
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:52,821
You're the one who
dragged me into the car.

1120
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,237
You're the one who said highway
and dappankutthu dance.

1121
01:00:55,279 --> 01:00:56,612
As if she's my aunt's only child

1122
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,654
for me to take her on
a family trip in my car!

1123
01:00:58,904 --> 01:00:59,946
Hmph!

1124
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:01,862
Just tell her to leave right away!

1125
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:03,320
She's the girl I love, dude.

1126
01:01:03,404 --> 01:01:05,529
If you love her,
take her to your house, man!

1127
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:09,487
Dude, please calm down.

1128
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:12,153
I don't want to hear anything.
Ask her to leave immediately.

1129
01:01:13,696 --> 01:01:15,237
Go and have a lime juice.

1130
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,821
His bloody lime juice!

1131
01:01:17,862 --> 01:01:19,529
- Cool down, man.
- Get lost!

1132
01:01:23,153 --> 01:01:25,279
Nidhi, we can explain it
to your dad and mom.

1133
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,904
We can tell them what happened.

1134
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:29,029
No, no.

1135
01:01:29,737 --> 01:01:31,404
I can't face them.

1136
01:01:32,779 --> 01:01:35,070
You don't have to go through
all this trouble for me.

1137
01:01:35,112 --> 01:01:36,195
I can take care of it.

1138
01:01:37,153 --> 01:01:38,195
Nidhi... Nidhi...

1139
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:39,279
Please, sit.

1140
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,029
Stay seated, please...

1141
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:56,445
Nidhi.

1142
01:01:56,487 --> 01:01:58,029
You must understand our situation.

1143
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:00,988
We can somehow convince your parents.
Please...

1144
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,737
I said I'll go, right?

1145
01:02:03,529 --> 01:02:06,112
You can't even cross the road
on your own, so where will you go?

1146
01:02:10,612 --> 01:02:12,696
Nidhi, his uncle bought this car
after wanting it forever.

1147
01:02:12,737 --> 01:02:14,862
He got it yesterday and now
we're stranded without petrol.

1148
01:02:14,904 --> 01:02:16,612
We don't even have money for that.

1149
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:20,237
Please try to understand.

1150
01:02:23,737 --> 01:02:24,862
What is the problem, sir?

1151
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:26,320
If the kids have gone out,

1152
01:02:26,445 --> 01:02:28,029
they'll be back by evening, right?

1153
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:29,862
Would you be okay if it was your daughter?

1154
01:02:29,904 --> 01:02:31,821
What else do I say, sir?

1155
01:02:31,988 --> 01:02:34,445
This isn't a place where kids
aren't allowed to roam, right?

1156
01:02:34,612 --> 01:02:36,570
Do you have any number
where we can reach Aryan?

1157
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:38,237
No, sir. There is no other number.

1158
01:02:38,737 --> 01:02:39,821
Who's that?

1159
01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:42,195
Sir, this is Joy, our neighbour.

1160
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:43,404
Are you a member?

1161
01:02:43,445 --> 01:02:45,696
A lot of people have invited
but I haven't joined.

1162
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:47,487
I'm not interested in politics, sir.

1163
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:49,862
Sir, Joy's nephew, Shine.

1164
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:52,946
He's also been missing since this morning.

1165
01:02:52,988 --> 01:02:54,946
Joy bought a new car.

1166
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:58,237
We think they all left in that car.

1167
01:03:00,112 --> 01:03:01,153
Car.

1168
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:02,195
Friend.

1169
01:03:18,487 --> 01:03:19,362
Hello.

1170
01:03:19,404 --> 01:03:21,988
I am SI Shaji from
Chooravattom Police Station.

1171
01:03:22,737 --> 01:03:23,862
SI?!

1172
01:03:23,904 --> 01:03:25,737
Shine, I'll give you two hours.

1173
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:26,821
For what?

1174
01:03:26,862 --> 01:03:29,779
You, Aryan and that girl
should come here and surrender.

1175
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,279
Or we'll catch you and lock you up.

1176
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,112
Or else I'll charge you with
every possible offence

1177
01:03:35,153 --> 01:03:36,279
and throw you in jail.

1178
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:38,362
It's more complicated than you think.

1179
01:03:38,404 --> 01:03:41,362
That girl's family
is very strong politically.

1180
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:43,612
So, you, him, and that
girl should come to this station

1181
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,779
within 2 hours and present yourselves.

1182
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:47,946
We'll be there, sir.

1183
01:03:48,237 --> 01:03:49,821
Promise, sir. I swear on my mother.

1184
01:03:50,862 --> 01:03:52,112
Dude...

1185
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:53,654
- Full problem.
- What happened?

1186
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,988
The police just called me.

1187
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:57,696
They're saying her dad
is some big influencer.

1188
01:03:57,737 --> 01:03:59,279
We can't go back now.

1189
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,279
They're going to beat us up
and throw us in jail.

1190
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,195
Stop shivering like this,
we can figure something out.

1191
01:04:03,237 --> 01:04:04,279
Figure what out?

1192
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,195
We've got no money
and the car's running on empty.

1193
01:04:06,237 --> 01:04:07,487
Hey!

1194
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:13,112
This must be our fate.

1195
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:15,195
Shouldn't we help her
get out of this misery?

1196
01:04:18,737 --> 01:04:19,737
The highway isn't safe.

1197
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:20,988
Let's take the coastal route.

1198
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:22,279
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1199
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,195
What was wrong with me! Damn!

1200
01:04:24,654 --> 01:04:26,821
Bro, is there any finance place?
To pawn a gold chain.

1201
01:04:26,862 --> 01:04:29,112
There's one over there.
And on that side too.

1202
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,946
"O introvert enchantress,
You cast a silent spell of magic"

1203
01:04:44,988 --> 01:04:49,821
"You are the soft mist
That drifts beneath moonlight"

1204
01:04:49,862 --> 01:04:54,612
"Your lilting melody calms
The deepest storms inside me"

1205
01:04:54,696 --> 01:04:59,779
"Petite as a deer,
You are my tender beloved"

1206
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:01,362
Hey! Switch off your phone!

1207
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:03,112
You look straight and drive.

1208
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:04,153
Get lost!

1209
01:05:04,195 --> 01:05:05,862
Haven't you done enough?

1210
01:05:05,904 --> 01:05:07,070
"I've fallen in love"

1211
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,696
His bloody photography.

1212
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:11,904
"What sorcery has changed me?"

1213
01:05:12,237 --> 01:05:14,320
"I wander as a Romeo"

1214
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:16,696
"I've fallen in love"

1215
01:05:16,904 --> 01:05:18,862
"Lost in the universe of you"

1216
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:21,529
"What sorcery has changed me?"

1217
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,612
"I wander as a Romeo"

1218
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,570
"Is it fate's quiet conspiracy"

1219
01:05:36,612 --> 01:05:38,904
"Ripples of our love circling the world?"

1220
01:05:38,988 --> 01:05:41,320
"You shine like a star
Glinting beyond reach"

1221
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:43,862
"This love is a fever without remedy"

1222
01:05:43,904 --> 01:05:45,737
"A gentle blossom
That scorches with longing"

1223
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:46,862
Come on, let's go.

1224
01:05:46,904 --> 01:05:48,821
"Leaving only ache behind"

1225
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,904
"A distant frenzy"

1226
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,153
"Come, sit beside me
As the journey begins"

1227
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:55,737
"All doors knocked, all dreams pursued"

1228
01:05:55,779 --> 01:05:58,029
"Nothing gained but a lost soul"

1229
01:05:58,112 --> 01:05:59,696
"Weary and adrift,
I wandered without compass"

1230
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:01,320
Call him and...

1231
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:03,029
"No complaints left, no one to hear them"

1232
01:06:05,904 --> 01:06:07,696
Or I should...

1233
01:06:11,112 --> 01:06:12,153
Brother...

1234
01:06:12,529 --> 01:06:14,112
Eh? Brother?!

1235
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,237
Why did that boy's parents
speak so rudely?

1236
01:06:17,279 --> 01:06:18,529
Which boy?

1237
01:06:18,904 --> 01:06:20,153
Friend...

1238
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:22,112
That's because at midnight... Ugh!

1239
01:06:22,153 --> 01:06:24,570
How am I going to explain it in English?

1240
01:06:24,988 --> 01:06:26,029
Sister...

1241
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:28,654
If a girl travels with two guys at night,

1242
01:06:28,696 --> 01:06:30,237
people in Kerala don't like it.

1243
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,279
You may sleep.

1244
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:35,153
What's so wrong about that?

1245
01:06:35,195 --> 01:06:37,320
There's nothing wrong... You please rest.

1246
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:39,737
Wrong, it seems!

1247
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:44,153
Also, would you just get into
any car like that?

1248
01:06:44,195 --> 01:06:45,696
What is this behaviour?

1249
01:06:46,153 --> 01:06:47,237
How shameful!

1250
01:06:47,487 --> 01:06:48,570
Yuck!

1251
01:06:50,195 --> 01:06:52,029
Why did I even bring these
two into my car?

1252
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:55,153
This is like losing the car you want
and wrecking the one you have.

1253
01:06:59,904 --> 01:07:00,737
Hello.

1254
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:02,112
Dude, where are you?

1255
01:07:02,153 --> 01:07:03,487
We are in...

1256
01:07:04,112 --> 01:07:05,112
Ottapalam.

1257
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:07,279
Dude, there's nothing to worry.
Just come home.

1258
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,904
All the problems here are sorted.

1259
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:11,529
They're saying they'll get them married.

1260
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,570
Married?!

1261
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,029
Yes, marriage.

1262
01:07:14,112 --> 01:07:16,112
Her family is embarrassed
because she ran away.

1263
01:07:16,153 --> 01:07:18,237
Everyone here is upset about it.

1264
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:20,112
I'm more worried than they are, dude!

1265
01:07:20,153 --> 01:07:22,404
One guy kicked
and broke Chachan's car tail lamp.

1266
01:07:22,445 --> 01:07:24,570
If he sees that, he'll definitely kill me.

1267
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:27,779
Chachan loves you more
than his car.

1268
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:28,696
Eh?

1269
01:07:28,737 --> 01:07:30,737
He's been waiting here
without even eating,

1270
01:07:30,821 --> 01:07:32,112
just to see you.

1271
01:07:32,153 --> 01:07:34,112
Everyone is upset, you guys come back.

1272
01:07:34,153 --> 01:07:35,195
Come soon.

1273
01:07:35,237 --> 01:07:36,821
- Did Chachan really say that?
- Yes.

1274
01:07:36,862 --> 01:07:38,487
Also, don't switch off your phone, okay?

1275
01:07:38,529 --> 01:07:39,737
I won't!

1276
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,529
Sister!

1277
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,696
You're getting married!

1278
01:07:44,612 --> 01:07:45,779
Aryan!

1279
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:47,029
My dear Aryan!

1280
01:07:53,404 --> 01:07:54,570
Why didn't you go along too?

1281
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,696
Just missed it.

1282
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:58,237
Hey!

1283
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,320
Advance happy married life, dude!

1284
01:08:09,487 --> 01:08:11,029
They've fixed your wedding with her.

1285
01:08:11,612 --> 01:08:13,112
- Fixed our wedding?!
- Yep!

1286
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:14,821
They're under pressure and embarrassed.

1287
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:16,320
So, they're getting you two married.

1288
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:19,195
- Who told you?
- Niju called and said.

1289
01:08:19,237 --> 01:08:20,279
Niju?!

1290
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,237
- Get lost, man!
- I swear on my mother!

1291
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:23,696
Why will he lie?

1292
01:08:25,612 --> 01:08:26,612
For real!

1293
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:44,404
Dude, I can't keep living like this.

1294
01:08:44,445 --> 01:08:46,029
I need to find a job

1295
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:47,279
and take good care of her.

1296
01:08:48,195 --> 01:08:49,362
You've finally become a man!

1297
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:50,570
- Of course, you should!
- Let's go?

1298
01:08:50,612 --> 01:08:52,279
Come.
Let's go back home straight.

1299
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,487
Then we will tell her.

1300
01:08:59,737 --> 01:09:01,029
Nidhi... Frooti!

1301
01:09:01,612 --> 01:09:03,029
- I don't want.
- Biscuit?

1302
01:09:03,445 --> 01:09:04,570
No.

1303
01:09:05,404 --> 01:09:06,404
Let's go.

1304
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:11,279
Nidhi, I know the husband
of your dreams

1305
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,237
is well-settled, well-educated,
well-standard and all.

1306
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:17,279
But I'm going to try to be like that now.

1307
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:18,570
Wow!

1308
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,862
Bravo!

1309
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,487
You know, I never thought
I'd get married before my brother.

1310
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:26,612
But Nidhi...

1311
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:29,195
Everything happens for a reason.

1312
01:09:29,237 --> 01:09:30,529
Yes.

1313
01:09:32,654 --> 01:09:33,821
Don't worry, don't worry!

1314
01:09:33,862 --> 01:09:34,904
Dude, it's the police!

1315
01:09:34,946 --> 01:09:36,195
I'll deal with them.

1316
01:09:36,904 --> 01:09:38,320
Why are the police here?

1317
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:39,904
Sir, we're a family, sir. Family...

1318
01:09:39,988 --> 01:09:41,487
- Whose family?
- Sister... sister...

1319
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:43,237
- Sister...
- Whose sister?

1320
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:44,529
But sir...

1321
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,237
- Get out...
- Family... We're going home, sir.

1322
01:09:47,237 --> 01:09:48,612
Shine, you said the marriage was fixed?

1323
01:09:48,696 --> 01:09:50,153
Sir, it wasn't just me.
They were on it too!

1324
01:09:50,195 --> 01:09:51,862
He's the groom, not me.

1325
01:09:51,904 --> 01:09:53,404
Aryan!

1326
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,279
Aryan!

1327
01:09:55,737 --> 01:09:57,862
Isn't it morning for you yet?

1328
01:09:57,904 --> 01:09:59,654
What world are you living in?

1329
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,862
You'll be walking in and out of courts
for a while now.

1330
01:10:01,904 --> 01:10:03,112
I'll make sure of it.

1331
01:10:03,153 --> 01:10:04,195
Please sir, please, please...

1332
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:05,654
You don't worry.

1333
01:10:05,696 --> 01:10:07,946
We've asked your parents
to come to the station.

1334
01:10:07,988 --> 01:10:09,112
Stay strong.

1335
01:10:11,153 --> 01:10:13,404
This isn't such a big deal.

1336
01:10:14,988 --> 01:10:17,904
Her parents will definitely
get you both married.

1337
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:21,821
You two can live happily ever after
once you're married.

1338
01:10:24,029 --> 01:10:25,195
Aryan...

1339
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:27,237
Can you pass me that Frooti?

1340
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:05,153
Dude, give me some.

1341
01:11:07,195 --> 01:11:09,153
- Give me...
- Drink water or something else.

1342
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:11,237
Just give me some, dude...

1343
01:11:13,612 --> 01:11:14,737
Give...

1344
01:11:15,112 --> 01:11:16,904
Hey, get in!

1345
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:21,654
They kept the bar
open past 11 till 12.

1346
01:11:21,696 --> 01:11:22,862
- Sit over there.
- Sit down.

1347
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,779
And purposely targeting
people with money.

1348
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:26,195
What kind of ethics is this!

1349
01:11:27,237 --> 01:11:28,445
What a pain!

1350
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:30,404
Aren't you tired of sitting
so close to him?

1351
01:11:30,445 --> 01:11:31,737
Move over!

1352
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:33,612
Do you want something to drink?

1353
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:36,612
- No...
- Don't want anything?

1354
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:39,904
- Anything to drink?
- Can I get a tea?

1355
01:11:39,988 --> 01:11:41,195
One tea for me too.

1356
01:11:41,237 --> 01:11:42,362
Be quiet!

1357
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:45,487
Do you want something to drink? No?

1358
01:11:45,696 --> 01:11:47,862
I want a double large on the rocks.

1359
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:49,112
- Hey!
- Yes, sir.

1360
01:11:49,153 --> 01:11:50,404
Lock him up.

1361
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,862
We'll serve him his drink over there.

1362
01:11:52,904 --> 01:11:54,195
- Get up.
- I'm okay!

1363
01:11:54,237 --> 01:11:55,570
Get up, man! What okay?

1364
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:58,195
- I'm an NRI!
- You come to the cell, you bloody NRI!

1365
01:11:58,237 --> 01:11:59,737
- Walk, man!
- Let me go, sir!

1366
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:08,904
Sir, we got hold of those kids.

1367
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,570
We've informed them.

1368
01:12:11,612 --> 01:12:14,029
It'll take at least 5 to 6 hours
to get here from Kottayam.

1369
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:15,445
Alright, sir.

1370
01:12:15,737 --> 01:12:16,862
Okay, sir.

1371
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:47,612
Hey, hey! Get up!

1372
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:48,696
Aryan...

1373
01:12:48,737 --> 01:12:50,529
- Get up! Wake up!
- Open your eyes.

1374
01:12:55,612 --> 01:12:56,612
Hey...

1375
01:12:57,195 --> 01:12:58,404
Aryan!

1376
01:13:02,029 --> 01:13:03,737
Don't worry too much.

1377
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,570
We can work out a compromise.

1378
01:13:05,612 --> 01:13:06,821
Did you have something?

1379
01:13:07,529 --> 01:13:08,612
Aryan...

1380
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:09,988
Dad!

1381
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:15,529
Dad! What happened to you?

1382
01:13:15,696 --> 01:13:17,862
Oh, no... I don't know what to do...

1383
01:13:18,237 --> 01:13:20,029
Eh? Is this for testing in the lab?

1384
01:13:21,737 --> 01:13:22,862
Aryan...

1385
01:13:22,904 --> 01:13:24,404
Can you pass me that Frooti?

1386
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:32,195
Hey...

1387
01:13:32,237 --> 01:13:34,404
Chettan, she's had the same thing too.

1388
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:38,279
- What's happening?
- Look, Dad...

1389
01:13:39,612 --> 01:13:41,570
- It's nothing. You're okay.
- What's happening to you?

1390
01:13:41,612 --> 01:13:43,153
- What happened?
- Sir, come fast.

1391
01:13:43,195 --> 01:13:44,696
What did you all do to them?

1392
01:13:44,737 --> 01:13:46,153
Stop staring and go get some water!

1393
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:47,320
Prakash! Nidhi!

1394
01:13:47,404 --> 01:13:48,404
Nidhi, what happened to you?

1395
01:13:48,445 --> 01:13:50,487
- Sir, come fast.
- Water, water.

1396
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:51,529
Drink some water, dear.

1397
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,320
- Aryan, drink some water, son.
- Nidhi, open your eyes.

1398
01:13:53,404 --> 01:13:54,612
- Nidhi, look at me.
- What happened?

1399
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,529
- Looks like they took poison.
- Poison?!

1400
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,529
Is it poison?

1401
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,070
- Speak up!
- Aryan...

1402
01:13:59,112 --> 01:14:00,445
Bro!

1403
01:14:01,112 --> 01:14:02,112
Joy...

1404
01:14:02,153 --> 01:14:03,570
Ask that jeep to come back.

1405
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:05,404
- Take him to the car.
- Slowly, carry her.

1406
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,654
- Carry her.
- Sir, ask them to start the jeep.

1407
01:14:07,696 --> 01:14:10,153
- Start the car!
- Come on.

1408
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,737
Quick, let's go.

1409
01:14:11,821 --> 01:14:13,445
Start the car, soon!

1410
01:14:13,487 --> 01:14:14,737
- Put her in.
- Careful...

1411
01:14:15,404 --> 01:14:16,487
Quickly, put her in.

1412
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:17,862
Let's go fast.

1413
01:14:17,904 --> 01:14:19,904
- Come on, let's go quickly!
- Get in! Get in!

1414
01:14:19,946 --> 01:14:20,862
Nidhi...

1415
01:14:20,904 --> 01:14:23,737
Do you love me so much that
you don't want me to have poison?

1416
01:14:25,112 --> 01:14:27,153
- Get going!
- Hang on!

1417
01:14:45,612 --> 01:14:46,988
How's Aryan?

1418
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:48,195
He's okay now.

1419
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:50,112
He was in critical condition
when they brought him in.

1420
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:51,904
Nothing to worry, she's fine.

1421
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,112
You take rest.

1422
01:15:01,612 --> 01:15:08,696
"My heart disappearing at intervals"

1423
01:15:09,153 --> 01:15:13,570
"With memories chasing after"

1424
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,654
"Wandering all around"

1425
01:15:36,988 --> 01:15:38,070
How's he now?

1426
01:15:38,112 --> 01:15:40,862
He's alright now.

1427
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:43,320
He's tired because he was in the hospital
for so many days.

1428
01:15:45,529 --> 01:15:46,946
Got some work at home. Alright, then.

1429
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:48,237
Alright.

1430
01:15:48,445 --> 01:15:50,112
Wish I could see him.

1431
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,404
This is what you call true love.

1432
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:01,904
Aryan...

1433
01:16:02,445 --> 01:16:03,904
Why did you do that?

1434
01:16:05,737 --> 01:16:07,612
Why are you so obsessed with me?

1435
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:13,237
I drank poison because I didn't know
how else to handle that situation.

1436
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,445
But...

1437
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,862
Why would you die for me?

1438
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:20,279
I feel so much respect for him now.

1439
01:16:20,487 --> 01:16:21,737
Why? For taking poison?

1440
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,195
Don't do stupid things like this again.

1441
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:26,404
I've already told you...

1442
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:30,612
My choices or decisions
have no value.

1443
01:16:30,988 --> 01:16:32,404
I also had someone.

1444
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:34,445
She changed her WhatsApp picture
without asking me.

1445
01:16:34,487 --> 01:16:35,862
I dumped her right then and there.

1446
01:16:35,904 --> 01:16:37,779
You need to be more serious.

1447
01:16:37,821 --> 01:16:39,654
Don't waste your life like this.

1448
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,654
His is what you call true love.

1449
01:16:42,696 --> 01:16:44,529
Look at what happened to Nixon.

1450
01:16:47,529 --> 01:16:50,237
That guy threw away assets
worth millions for a girl.

1451
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:06,904
- As-salamu alaykum, Uppa.
- Wa ‘alaykum as-salam wa rahmatullah.

1452
01:17:07,153 --> 01:17:08,404
Suhana?

1453
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:11,112
Suhana...

1454
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:14,237
Dear, she has been
missing since yesterday.

1455
01:17:15,404 --> 01:17:17,570
We received a phone call
at 8.30 this morning.

1456
01:17:17,779 --> 01:17:21,362
Apparently, she ran away with someone
and got married.

1457
01:17:21,445 --> 01:17:23,445
She betrayed both you and us,
then just left, dear.

1458
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:25,654
You know I can't live without you, Nichu.

1459
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:29,070
And I can't live as another man's wife
in this lifetime.

1460
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:32,654
So, Nichu, find another girl
and live happily with her.

1461
01:17:32,696 --> 01:17:37,404
Let them suffer
seeing me live like this my whole life.

1462
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:39,821
This love is something else, right?

1463
01:18:01,654 --> 01:18:03,112
Keep an eye on him.

1464
01:18:03,487 --> 01:18:05,320
When I keep checking on him,

1465
01:18:05,404 --> 01:18:06,696
he will feel bad.

1466
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:07,862
Okay.

1467
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:14,362
Son, are you okay?

1468
01:18:14,445 --> 01:18:15,445
I'm okay.

1469
01:18:15,529 --> 01:18:16,737
Okay.

1470
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:20,237
'The little time I spent with you'

1471
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,529
'are the happiest moments of my life.'

1472
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,195
Hey...

1473
01:18:25,654 --> 01:18:26,612
Are you okay?

1474
01:18:26,654 --> 01:18:28,821
Why does everyone keep asking if I'm okay,
over and over?

1475
01:18:28,862 --> 01:18:30,529
Why would I not be okay?!

1476
01:18:37,988 --> 01:18:39,112
Listen...

1477
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:41,779
Your life isn't meant to be ruined
for someone else.

1478
01:18:41,821 --> 01:18:42,946
Come to the ground.

1479
01:18:43,362 --> 01:18:44,487
Everything will be fine.

1480
01:18:44,612 --> 01:18:46,195
Hey... I'm sorry...

1481
01:18:46,237 --> 01:18:48,362
At the station, they said they'd let me go
only if I said all that.

1482
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:50,445
- Sorry...
- I can understand... no worries...

1483
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,445
Don't be sad.

1484
01:18:54,612 --> 01:18:55,946
We're there for you.

1485
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:03,112
Don't waste water, man.

1486
01:19:03,153 --> 01:19:04,988
There's something powdery in the water.

1487
01:19:27,946 --> 01:19:29,029
Hello.

1488
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:30,654
Why weren't you answering?

1489
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:32,112
'I was sleeping.'

1490
01:19:32,737 --> 01:19:35,029
I can hear the sound of water
in the background.

1491
01:19:37,654 --> 01:19:39,279
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

1492
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:41,279
'I cannot sleep, dude.'

1493
01:19:41,445 --> 01:19:43,988
When I close my eyes,
all I think about is her.

1494
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,445
'Her face won't leave my mind.'

1495
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:49,195
And on top of that, all these people here.

1496
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:50,445
Dude...

1497
01:19:50,737 --> 01:19:52,237
They're driving me crazy

1498
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:54,779
with all this self-care
and counselling stuff.

1499
01:19:54,821 --> 01:19:57,904
Dude, I'm not in a position
to help you out.

1500
01:19:58,195 --> 01:19:59,988
Just think about poor Nixon.

1501
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:02,362
They won't even let him back
into his own house.

1502
01:20:02,487 --> 01:20:04,487
Compared to him, you're so lucky!

1503
01:20:11,529 --> 01:20:15,112
Do you know how many poor people
are dying in Somalia

1504
01:20:15,153 --> 01:20:18,779
every single day
without even a drop of water?

1505
01:20:20,029 --> 01:20:21,779
Who am I talking to?

1506
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:23,862
And here, rivers of alcohol are flowing.

1507
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:26,404
Our youth is getting ruined.

1508
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:28,696
You're wearing a football jersey.

1509
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:29,737
But what's the use?

1510
01:20:29,779 --> 01:20:31,737
Our youth don't even get to play.

1511
01:20:31,779 --> 01:20:34,153
There's no ground here. We must protest!

1512
01:20:34,237 --> 01:20:35,612
Random people are leading us.

1513
01:20:35,654 --> 01:20:37,029
Let the youth take the lead!

1514
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:40,821
It's when the youth lead that
new changes happen in the world.

1515
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:43,237
That's when real developments take place.

1516
01:20:43,362 --> 01:20:44,779
Don't we need development?

1517
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:46,195
Please somehow get a bottle, dude.

1518
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:49,404
- Want to get him drunk and knock him out.
- Your silence is the curse of this nation!

1519
01:20:55,195 --> 01:20:57,153
'She stopped coming to classes.'

1520
01:20:57,362 --> 01:20:59,320
'I think they took her back to Madurai.'

1521
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,153
'She is not in contact with anyone.'

1522
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:11,153
Son, did you eat?

1523
01:21:11,362 --> 01:21:12,362
Yeah.

1524
01:21:15,654 --> 01:21:16,862
Kochumon...

1525
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:20,029
Everyone was making fun of us
at the function.

1526
01:21:22,112 --> 01:21:23,362
Running away...

1527
01:21:23,946 --> 01:21:25,279
that's not the problem.

1528
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:27,279
You should've just brought her home.

1529
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:28,654
What was the issue?

1530
01:21:28,862 --> 01:21:30,862
But... you taking poison...

1531
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:33,904
that really broke me.

1532
01:21:35,529 --> 01:21:37,696
It's alright.
Don't do such things, okay?

1533
01:21:43,445 --> 01:21:45,696
[in unison] Happy Birthday to you, Tony!

1534
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:47,070
Thank you.

1535
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:48,612
Play music.

1536
01:21:53,946 --> 01:21:55,862
Hey, didn't you invite Aryan?

1537
01:21:56,696 --> 01:21:57,821
Go and call him!

1538
01:21:58,570 --> 01:22:00,612
I'll go get him.
Please don't finish the drinks.

1539
01:22:05,779 --> 01:22:06,821
Hello.

1540
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:09,445
You said you'd come
for Tony's birthday today.

1541
01:22:09,487 --> 01:22:10,946
No... I'm not coming today.

1542
01:22:12,195 --> 01:22:14,612
It has been a while
since we all got together. Come soon.

1543
01:22:18,195 --> 01:22:19,362
Super!

1544
01:22:21,612 --> 01:22:23,696
From today onwards
our team isn't Unnikulam.

1545
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:25,320
- It is Funnykulam.
- Hey, bro!

1546
01:22:26,487 --> 01:22:27,612
Dude!

1547
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:31,946
Have a drink, dude.

1548
01:22:32,195 --> 01:22:33,529
No need, bro.

1549
01:22:33,696 --> 01:22:34,779
No mood.

1550
01:22:35,112 --> 01:22:37,696
Not as bad as the poison you downed.
Come on, drink.

1551
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:39,612
Enough, enough.

1552
01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:42,654
Happy Birthday, Tony.

1553
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:44,362
- Forgot to wish you.
- Thank you, dear.

1554
01:22:44,904 --> 01:22:45,904
Dear...

1555
01:22:46,112 --> 01:22:47,904
Let go of all this love nonsense.

1556
01:22:48,737 --> 01:22:50,445
Come back as the old Aryan.

1557
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:52,445
Girls will come and go.

1558
01:22:53,862 --> 01:22:56,404
Look at him! Look how cool he is.

1559
01:22:58,529 --> 01:23:00,779
- Chug it!
- Look at him dance...

1560
01:23:01,988 --> 01:23:03,279
Look at him sing...

1561
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:06,362
Lost his tip and his chick, Suhana.

1562
01:23:06,696 --> 01:23:08,445
Still... look at him celebrating.

1563
01:23:09,153 --> 01:23:13,821
"Today's the little one's birthday
What a fine and happy day"

1564
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:19,153
"Wonder who poured it out"

1565
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:46,904
Next time, we cut the cake first.

1566
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,279
And only then, the alcohol.

1567
01:23:48,362 --> 01:23:50,362
Now there's no one here
when I'm cutting the cake.

1568
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:53,445
I can't believe I was praising this whiner
just a while ago.

1569
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:55,696
You drank like a fish!

1570
01:23:55,862 --> 01:23:56,904
Nixon...

1571
01:23:56,946 --> 01:23:57,988
Hey...

1572
01:23:58,362 --> 01:23:59,862
- You don't know, man...
- I don't...

1573
01:23:59,988 --> 01:24:02,779
You don't know how my dad looked after me.

1574
01:24:03,195 --> 01:24:04,779
After my mother died,

1575
01:24:05,153 --> 01:24:07,779
he took such great care of us.

1576
01:24:07,862 --> 01:24:08,862
Bad upbringing.

1577
01:24:08,904 --> 01:24:10,654
I left him and...

1578
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:12,529
Don't ruin your birthday.

1579
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:13,988
I've everything, man...

1580
01:24:14,696 --> 01:24:16,195
Get up you sigma male.

1581
01:24:16,237 --> 01:24:18,487
And despite all that... all for her...

1582
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:20,195
- It's okay...
- Just think about it...

1583
01:24:20,237 --> 01:24:22,404
What all I did for her...

1584
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:24,570
I went and told her the day after you left

1585
01:24:24,612 --> 01:24:27,946
that you'd given up your house,
car and all assets for her.

1586
01:24:27,988 --> 01:24:28,946
Did you?

1587
01:24:28,988 --> 01:24:31,195
You think she thought
you gave up everything

1588
01:24:31,237 --> 01:24:33,029
and would come back as a beggar?

1589
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:36,404
Get up now.

1590
01:24:39,821 --> 01:24:40,862
Dear...

1591
01:24:40,904 --> 01:24:42,696
I'm telling you again...

1592
01:24:43,029 --> 01:24:45,445
Love is nothing but politics.

1593
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:50,029
It's got caste, religion,
money and all that nonsense.

1594
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,487
No girl will stand by you...

1595
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:53,445
Correct.

1596
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:54,821
You better watch out!

1597
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:57,696
And look who's giving advice!

1598
01:25:01,779 --> 01:25:03,445
Are you drinking poison again?

1599
01:25:05,153 --> 01:25:07,279
Are you itching to go to the ICU again?

1600
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,821
It's okay, dude...

1601
01:25:10,237 --> 01:25:11,279
Let it go.

1602
01:25:11,362 --> 01:25:13,404
When will I see her again?

1603
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:19,862
Even my dad gave me
the sad look and cried.

1604
01:25:19,946 --> 01:25:23,445
We'll start a relationship
only after signing an agreement!

1605
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:25,153
I want to see her.

1606
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:27,237
I need to see her.

1607
01:25:29,112 --> 01:25:32,112
Let it all out! It'll be fine.

1608
01:25:32,404 --> 01:25:34,654
Why are you wailing, dude?

1609
01:25:34,779 --> 01:25:37,696
Guys even go to Nagaland
for the woman they love.

1610
01:25:37,779 --> 01:25:38,696
Really?

1611
01:25:38,737 --> 01:25:39,779
Don't you know?

1612
01:25:39,821 --> 01:25:41,737
If you catch a bus
from Kottayam in the morning,

1613
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:43,195
you'll be in Madurai by evening.

1614
01:25:43,237 --> 01:25:44,779
I'll come with you.

1615
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:46,946
Sibi...

1616
01:25:46,988 --> 01:25:49,070
You're the one who
motivates him for no reason

1617
01:25:49,112 --> 01:25:50,362
and gets him into trouble.

1618
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,988
You go to Nagaland alone!
Why'd you wanna take him?

1619
01:25:53,279 --> 01:25:54,988
His stupid Nagaland.

1620
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,153
Huh?

1621
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:10,153
Your motivation boost is peaking right now.

1622
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:12,153
I haven't been able to sleep since.

1623
01:26:12,445 --> 01:26:13,862
Motivation...?

1624
01:26:13,946 --> 01:26:15,070
You were right.

1625
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:17,112
I've to go to Madurai and see her.

1626
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:18,988
That was the booze talking, dude.

1627
01:26:19,029 --> 01:26:21,153
Why would you listen to that
and get all set to go?

1628
01:26:21,237 --> 01:26:22,862
Go and pack your bags. Let's go.

1629
01:26:22,946 --> 01:26:24,737
I'll pack... For now, you just wait here.

1630
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:26,070
Go and come back in the morning.

1631
01:26:26,112 --> 01:26:27,904
If you sleep it off now,
your problem will be gone.

1632
01:26:27,946 --> 01:26:28,988
I promise you...

1633
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:30,779
- You should come...
- Just go, dude...

1634
01:26:30,862 --> 01:26:33,320
- You're the one who motivated me.
- It was an honest mistake. Just go!

1635
01:26:33,362 --> 01:26:35,279
- You said you'll come.
- Let me sleep. You're mad!

1636
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,696
- Sibi...
- Good night.

1637
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:54,737
No chance.

1638
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:56,404
You won't get an address from college.

1639
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,404
'Looks like they've blocked everything,'

1640
01:26:58,445 --> 01:27:00,153
thinking you might go looking for her.

1641
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,029
Hey, I'll break your bones
if you do anything stupid.

1642
01:27:04,112 --> 01:27:06,529
There's no place in Madurai
I don't know, no one I don't know.

1643
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:07,737
Where will you hide, huh?

1644
01:27:08,112 --> 01:27:09,320
You better be here!

1645
01:27:09,362 --> 01:27:10,404
Greetings, bro.

1646
01:27:10,445 --> 01:27:11,529
Bro, my name is Aryan.

1647
01:27:11,612 --> 01:27:12,821
Do you have an address?

1648
01:27:12,946 --> 01:27:13,779
No address.

1649
01:27:13,821 --> 01:27:15,529
How will we find her without an address?

1650
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,946
It's going to be very difficult.

1651
01:27:17,362 --> 01:27:19,570
Her name is Nidhi Sathyaprakash.

1652
01:27:20,029 --> 01:27:22,279
Her mother works in Railways.

1653
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,112
- Where are you from?
- Unnikulam.

1654
01:27:24,153 --> 01:27:25,279
Unnikulam?!

1655
01:27:25,946 --> 01:27:28,362
This isn't like Unnikulam,
it's a huge city.

1656
01:27:28,487 --> 01:27:30,112
A 10- day celebration is happening here,

1657
01:27:30,153 --> 01:27:31,654
the Meenakshi Temple festival.

1658
01:27:32,195 --> 01:27:34,445
The whole city will gather here
to pray to the Goddess.

1659
01:27:34,487 --> 01:27:35,737
- Ah, okay.
- Got it?

1660
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:37,529
There's a chance your girl will also come.

1661
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:38,570
You can look for her.

1662
01:27:38,612 --> 01:27:40,821
If you find her, call it destiny
and take her with you.

1663
01:27:40,862 --> 01:27:45,487
"I search for your glances"

1664
01:27:47,237 --> 01:27:52,862
"Wandering lost and alone"

1665
01:27:55,195 --> 01:27:58,779
"This too shall pass"

1666
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:02,404
"The endless chatter will return"

1667
01:28:02,529 --> 01:28:06,904
"Please come back,
Grant me that moment once more"

1668
01:28:08,487 --> 01:28:12,237
"I search for your glances"

1669
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,612
"Wandering lost and alone"

1670
01:28:16,153 --> 01:28:19,404
"In the midst of my pain"

1671
01:28:19,904 --> 01:28:23,153
"My vision and voice tremble
Along the way"

1672
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:27,070
"I search for your glances"

1673
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:30,821
"Wandering lost and alone"

1674
01:28:31,404 --> 01:28:34,696
"In the midst of my pain"

1675
01:28:35,195 --> 01:28:38,821
"My vision and voice tremble
Along the way"

1676
01:28:56,029 --> 01:28:59,612
"Don't fade away"

1677
01:28:59,696 --> 01:29:02,862
"Don't vanish into
The earth's deep shadows"

1678
01:29:03,696 --> 01:29:07,529
"Don't wither"

1679
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:11,070
"Don't disappear like a bird
Caught in flight"

1680
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,404
"I am the burning sun"

1681
01:29:15,862 --> 01:29:19,279
"You, the soothing raincloud"

1682
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:23,487
"As the world's sorrows shake us"

1683
01:29:24,404 --> 01:29:26,612
"We fall together as rain, in rhythm"

1684
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:30,029
"Don't fade away"

1685
01:29:30,195 --> 01:29:33,570
"Don't vanish into
The earth's deep shadows"

1686
01:29:34,237 --> 01:29:37,529
"Don't wither"

1687
01:29:38,029 --> 01:29:43,279
"Don't disappear like a bird
Caught in flight"

1688
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:16,029
"Here in this corner, I wait alone,
Still searching for you,"

1689
01:30:16,153 --> 01:30:23,696
"While clouds drift by
On our path, indifferent"

1690
01:30:24,612 --> 01:30:32,029
"Like seagulls casting
Fleeting shadows on the sea"

1691
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:40,279
"Will we bloom as a flower
Opening in the night?"

1692
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:51,237
'It's been almost
four days since you left.'

1693
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,029
Your mom is quite worried here.

1694
01:30:54,487 --> 01:30:56,904
'Come back once you've sorted things out.'

1695
01:30:57,029 --> 01:30:59,195
I'm guessing you don't have much
cash on you.

1696
01:31:00,029 --> 01:31:01,195
I'll put some cash.

1697
01:31:01,445 --> 01:31:02,779
No, Dad. No need.

1698
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:03,904
'I've got money.'

1699
01:31:03,988 --> 01:31:05,279
Try to come back soon, okay?

1700
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,070
No, Dad. I'll only come back
once I see her.

1701
01:31:07,112 --> 01:31:09,362
Alright, you take care, okay?

1702
01:31:25,237 --> 01:31:26,237
What the hell, man!

1703
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:27,988
What a crappy place this is!

1704
01:31:28,029 --> 01:31:29,487
Couldn't you stay in a better place?

1705
01:31:29,529 --> 01:31:30,904
- What's this, man?
- Ugh!

1706
01:31:35,445 --> 01:31:38,112
We came here because your dad
told us to.

1707
01:31:38,404 --> 01:31:41,779
People say you ended up like this
because of me.

1708
01:31:42,112 --> 01:31:43,779
That's ruined my reputation now.

1709
01:31:44,862 --> 01:31:46,821
Let's catch the bus back tomorrow morning.

1710
01:31:47,112 --> 01:31:48,112
I'm not coming.

1711
01:31:48,153 --> 01:31:48,988
Huh?

1712
01:31:49,029 --> 01:31:50,279
I'll only come after I see her.

1713
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,529
So, you haven't seen her yet?

1714
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,153
What have you been doing all this time?

1715
01:31:53,445 --> 01:31:55,029
I was searching for her address.

1716
01:31:55,821 --> 01:31:57,612
Pick up that phone and call her.

1717
01:31:57,654 --> 01:31:58,862
I don't have her number.

1718
01:31:59,696 --> 01:32:00,862
Man...

1719
01:32:01,445 --> 01:32:03,153
You don't have her number,

1720
01:32:03,237 --> 01:32:04,404
or her address

1721
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:06,404
and she hasn't called you even once.

1722
01:32:06,612 --> 01:32:09,029
She must have long forgotten you
and moved on by now.

1723
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:10,988
Look at you wandering around aimlessly!

1724
01:32:11,112 --> 01:32:13,404
You will end up looking like a clown.

1725
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:18,153
So I've become a joker to you, huh?

1726
01:32:18,195 --> 01:32:20,153
A joker before my family and friends.

1727
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:21,821
A joker who eloped
in the name of love.

1728
01:32:21,862 --> 01:32:23,195
A joker who drank poison.

1729
01:32:24,153 --> 01:32:26,320
A joker who's doing something and all!

1730
01:32:26,821 --> 01:32:27,904
A clown...

1731
01:32:28,195 --> 01:32:29,320
Mmm...

1732
01:32:29,946 --> 01:32:31,904
But I won't be at peace until I see her.

1733
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,612
That's all there is to it.
I'll come home only after I see her.

1734
01:32:41,862 --> 01:32:42,946
Nixon bro!

1735
01:32:43,195 --> 01:32:44,654
I can't find him here.

1736
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:48,445
You shouldn't have told him
all that yesterday.

1737
01:32:48,779 --> 01:32:51,320
After all, you do have a part to play
in his current situation.

1738
01:32:52,988 --> 01:32:54,529
He keeps cutting the call.

1739
01:33:00,404 --> 01:33:01,529
Hello bro!

1740
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:04,445
Over here, bro!

1741
01:33:04,988 --> 01:33:06,029
How are you, bro?

1742
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:07,862
I'm good. How are you?

1743
01:33:08,904 --> 01:33:09,946
How's your dad?

1744
01:33:10,029 --> 01:33:11,029
He's good.

1745
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,821
Are you here for purchasing?

1746
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:14,862
No, now we courier everything.

1747
01:33:14,946 --> 01:33:16,195
Oh, is it! Good, good.

1748
01:33:16,237 --> 01:33:19,195
- Bro, I wanted a help.
- Tell me.

1749
01:33:19,237 --> 01:33:21,570
A friend of mine from my hometown
has a lover.

1750
01:33:21,612 --> 01:33:23,779
So, we wanted to find her...

1751
01:33:24,529 --> 01:33:27,279
We've been roaming around
for a few days now.

1752
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:29,029
Do you've an address?

1753
01:33:29,445 --> 01:33:30,445
No, bro.

1754
01:33:30,487 --> 01:33:31,529
Any other details?

1755
01:33:31,654 --> 01:33:33,487
No other details, bro.

1756
01:33:33,821 --> 01:33:35,529
- Do you've a photo at least?
- Nope.

1757
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:37,529
Nothing?

1758
01:33:38,904 --> 01:33:39,988
What the...

1759
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,153
There's a guy called Lara here.

1760
01:33:42,362 --> 01:33:44,946
He knows every girl,
from the little ones to the big ones.

1761
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:48,654
He's like an encyclopaedia
when it comes to girls.

1762
01:33:48,737 --> 01:33:50,362
- But the timing is bad.
- Why?

1763
01:33:50,404 --> 01:33:53,612
There's a major conflict brewing
between two gangs right now.

1764
01:33:53,654 --> 01:33:54,487
Oh...

1765
01:33:54,529 --> 01:33:55,696
One gang is Maari's.

1766
01:33:55,904 --> 01:33:57,195
The other belongs to Ramana.

1767
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:00,487
This Lara caused Maari some trouble.

1768
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:02,988
And now Lara is in hiding.

1769
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,487
So, there's this guy who's Lara's friend.

1770
01:34:06,529 --> 01:34:07,570
Let me call him.

1771
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:09,320
He'll definitely help you for my sake.

1772
01:34:10,529 --> 01:34:12,821
- Tell me.
'- I need a small help.'

1773
01:34:12,862 --> 01:34:13,862
What's it?

1774
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:15,362
A few guys I know have come here.

1775
01:34:15,404 --> 01:34:16,654
Okay. Anything bothering them?

1776
01:34:16,904 --> 01:34:18,404
Yes, it is quite urgent.

1777
01:34:18,529 --> 01:34:19,862
They're very close to me.

1778
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,153
Alright, we'll see.

1779
01:34:21,195 --> 01:34:22,487
Send me the details.

1780
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,654
- I've told him.
- Okay.

1781
01:34:25,362 --> 01:34:26,779
I've told him everything.

1782
01:34:26,988 --> 01:34:28,904
He'll take care
of whatever problem there is.

1783
01:34:29,237 --> 01:34:30,737
Come, let us take a selfie together.

1784
01:34:31,029 --> 01:34:31,988
Selfie?!

1785
01:34:32,029 --> 01:34:33,612
- Fine... I guess...?
- Come closer?

1786
01:34:33,946 --> 01:34:35,612
Come on, smile.

1787
01:34:36,112 --> 01:34:37,195
Give a good smile!

1788
01:34:37,487 --> 01:34:38,696
Alright, then.

1789
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:40,529
Thank you. See you.

1790
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:45,696
Greetings!

1791
01:34:45,737 --> 01:34:47,237
He will definitely help us out.

1792
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:48,946
We'll see.

1793
01:34:54,529 --> 01:34:58,362
Whatever happens we will leave Tamil Nadu
only after finding his girl!

1794
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,153
Hey!

1795
01:35:02,654 --> 01:35:04,404
Yes, you. Come here.

1796
01:35:04,654 --> 01:35:05,779
Take this.

1797
01:35:08,279 --> 01:35:09,570
Are you from Kerala?

1798
01:35:09,612 --> 01:35:10,737
Yes, sir.

1799
01:35:10,779 --> 01:35:12,195
Are those your friends?

1800
01:35:12,612 --> 01:35:13,654
Yes, yes.

1801
01:35:13,737 --> 01:35:14,737
Come, come.

1802
01:35:15,529 --> 01:35:16,612
Come on.

1803
01:35:16,696 --> 01:35:18,153
Is this Ranga bro with a beard?

1804
01:35:18,195 --> 01:35:19,237
Sit down.

1805
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,487
You also sit.

1806
01:35:21,696 --> 01:35:23,737
Dear, don't smoke cigarettes.

1807
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:27,029
Your lifespan will be cut short
by 25 years.

1808
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:28,862
You won't live as long as you should.

1809
01:35:30,029 --> 01:35:31,195
Drink this.

1810
01:35:34,195 --> 01:35:35,612
Is it a love issue?

1811
01:35:35,654 --> 01:35:37,904
Yeah, it's my friend's love issue.

1812
01:35:38,362 --> 01:35:40,904
Grandpa... my... our friend...

1813
01:35:40,946 --> 01:35:42,737
He came here to search for his lover.

1814
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,404
And we came searching for him.

1815
01:35:44,988 --> 01:35:47,112
But he doesn't have her
address or anything.

1816
01:35:49,988 --> 01:35:52,654
Around 35 years back,

1817
01:35:53,029 --> 01:35:55,279
if I had friends like you...

1818
01:35:56,237 --> 01:35:58,237
I wouldn't have lost my love.

1819
01:35:58,654 --> 01:36:02,237
My girlfriend's family killed her...

1820
01:36:03,445 --> 01:36:04,737
right before my eyes...

1821
01:36:06,779 --> 01:36:08,279
Get me a piece of paper.

1822
01:36:14,529 --> 01:36:16,320
Go and drop this off at that place.

1823
01:36:16,445 --> 01:36:17,862
Go right away!

1824
01:36:18,821 --> 01:36:20,570
Don't wait for anyone.

1825
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:25,612
Sir.

1826
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:26,654
Greetings.

1827
01:36:26,696 --> 01:36:27,821
Sit down.

1828
01:36:29,654 --> 01:36:30,821
Give it.

1829
01:36:30,988 --> 01:36:33,153
Sir... someone gave this.

1830
01:36:33,904 --> 01:36:35,029
What is this?

1831
01:36:37,654 --> 01:36:38,779
Muthu bro!

1832
01:36:38,821 --> 01:36:40,779
Bring the bundle from B shelf.

1833
01:36:40,821 --> 01:36:41,821
Will get it now.

1834
01:36:47,445 --> 01:36:48,529
This...

1835
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:50,112
I've seen him somewhere...

1836
01:36:50,487 --> 01:36:52,279
Sir, who is on that flex?

1837
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,237
You don't know him
but you took the paper he gave you?

1838
01:36:55,779 --> 01:36:57,195
He's our party leader.

1839
01:36:57,237 --> 01:36:58,445
He was a former MLA.

1840
01:36:58,487 --> 01:36:59,654
Party leader?!

1841
01:36:59,696 --> 01:37:02,779
He doesn't even know who the leader is
and he brought his letter!

1842
01:37:03,112 --> 01:37:04,362
Here you go, bro!

1843
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:08,612
This is Madurai's latest voters list.

1844
01:37:08,654 --> 01:37:09,821
Take a look at this.

1845
01:37:09,862 --> 01:37:11,696
If not,
I'll ask him to get the next bundle.

1846
01:37:11,737 --> 01:37:12,946
Whoa...

1847
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:20,112
Bro, where's KK Road...

1848
01:37:20,153 --> 01:37:21,779
Do you know KK Nagar?

1849
01:37:22,737 --> 01:37:23,696
Tell him the address.

1850
01:37:23,737 --> 01:37:25,445
- Bro...
- This girl was studying in Kerala.

1851
01:37:25,487 --> 01:37:28,362
Do you know this address?

1852
01:37:28,654 --> 01:37:29,696
This one...

1853
01:37:29,737 --> 01:37:32,070
If you go straight and turn left,

1854
01:37:32,362 --> 01:37:34,029
- ...there will be a large pavilion.
- Okay.

1855
01:37:34,112 --> 01:37:35,779
Today is their child's function.

1856
01:37:35,821 --> 01:37:36,779
Function?

1857
01:37:36,821 --> 01:37:38,237
Yes, it's the child's function.

1858
01:37:38,279 --> 01:37:39,696
That's why they have installed a pavilion.

1859
01:37:39,737 --> 01:37:40,779
What function?

1860
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:41,821
Ceremony.

1861
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:43,362
Don't you know what a function means?

1862
01:37:43,570 --> 01:37:45,362
Where do we go search now?

1863
01:37:45,529 --> 01:37:47,237
- There's a small problem.
- What?

1864
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:48,404
It's her wedding.

1865
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:49,362
- Wedding?
- Yes.

1866
01:37:49,404 --> 01:37:50,946
- Who said?
- That guy.

1867
01:37:51,112 --> 01:37:52,153
- Got the house?
- Yes.

1868
01:37:52,195 --> 01:37:53,279
Let's go and look.

1869
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,612
- Who are you?
- We're college friends.

1870
01:38:13,737 --> 01:38:14,654
Eh?

1871
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:16,153
We're Nidhi's friends.

1872
01:38:16,195 --> 01:38:17,237
Oh...

1873
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:19,529
We're from Kerala, friends of the bride.

1874
01:38:21,988 --> 01:38:23,862
Sister, please come to the side.

1875
01:38:25,988 --> 01:38:28,153
We're her friends.

1876
01:38:28,195 --> 01:38:30,445
So, we wanted to wish her.

1877
01:38:30,946 --> 01:38:32,153
Facebook friends?

1878
01:38:32,195 --> 01:38:33,612
No, college friends.

1879
01:38:34,862 --> 01:38:36,988
I don't know
which girl you're talking about.

1880
01:38:37,029 --> 01:38:38,112
What happened?

1881
01:38:38,779 --> 01:38:40,404
What's it? Who are you guys?

1882
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:44,029
Bro, we studied with the girl
who lives here.

1883
01:38:45,737 --> 01:38:47,696
We wanted to give her certificates

1884
01:38:47,737 --> 01:38:49,279
as well as wish her.

1885
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,404
How are you, Tamil sir? All okay?

1886
01:38:52,112 --> 01:38:53,237
Enough... enough...

1887
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:54,404
Oh, no!

1888
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:02,570
Which college is giving what certificate
to a 13-year-old, huh?

1889
01:39:02,654 --> 01:39:04,737
You guys are thieves, aren't you?

1890
01:39:04,779 --> 01:39:05,946
Come out!

1891
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:09,029
Why aren't you saying anything?
Come on, come outside!

1892
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:10,570
We're very hungry, bro.

1893
01:39:10,779 --> 01:39:12,279
We thought it's a wedding ceremony.

1894
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:13,821
We're sorry, bro.

1895
01:39:14,904 --> 01:39:15,946
Right, guys?

1896
01:39:16,029 --> 01:39:17,195
Sorry... sorry...

1897
01:39:17,237 --> 01:39:18,654
Say something, you dogs!

1898
01:39:22,445 --> 01:39:24,612
They've printed a photo of that girl,
like a bride.

1899
01:39:25,029 --> 01:39:26,737
Whatever! Let us just eat and go.

1900
01:39:26,779 --> 01:39:27,821
Walk fast, uncle!

1901
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:30,195
How do you come up with
lies like this, man?

1902
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:31,445
I don't know, bro.

1903
01:39:31,612 --> 01:39:33,696
I'm full of lies,
right down to my fingertips.

1904
01:39:35,362 --> 01:39:37,404
Even her address was fake.

1905
01:39:37,696 --> 01:39:39,195
They're totally prepared.

1906
01:39:39,737 --> 01:39:41,195
They have shifted her from here.

1907
01:39:41,612 --> 01:39:43,737
Find a way to get him out of here.

1908
01:39:44,362 --> 01:39:46,237
You think he'll come!

1909
01:39:46,279 --> 01:39:48,029
We'll drag him out of here if we have to!

1910
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:53,404
What's the situation?

1911
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:55,153
You look for our return tickets.

1912
01:39:55,195 --> 01:39:56,862
We'll find a way to convince him to leave.

1913
01:39:56,904 --> 01:39:58,654
But he just cannot understand.

1914
01:40:07,153 --> 01:40:08,153
Nidhi!

1915
01:40:08,696 --> 01:40:09,696
Look!

1916
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:12,195
- Is that Nidhi?
- Yes.

1917
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:14,237
And you dragged us to that house!

1918
01:40:14,279 --> 01:40:15,988
That guy said so! What can I do?

1919
01:40:17,237 --> 01:40:18,404
- Come on.
- Let's go.

1920
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:19,779
Save us, O Jesus!

1921
01:40:21,654 --> 01:40:22,862
You sure this is her house?

1922
01:40:22,904 --> 01:40:24,404
Didn't you just see her go back in?

1923
01:40:24,445 --> 01:40:25,696
Shall I call him?

1924
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:27,696
No, first let's plan.

1925
01:40:27,737 --> 01:40:29,570
We talked it all through
and took an advance.

1926
01:40:29,862 --> 01:40:31,153
How can you say this now?

1927
01:40:31,195 --> 01:40:32,279
Who's that?

1928
01:40:32,779 --> 01:40:34,946
Looks like some Gounder,
a community leader.

1929
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:36,779
You're right, he does.

1930
01:40:38,153 --> 01:40:39,320
I'm hanging up.

1931
01:40:39,362 --> 01:40:40,654
He looks like Mafia Shashi.

1932
01:40:40,696 --> 01:40:41,862
Oh, he's coming this side.

1933
01:40:41,904 --> 01:40:42,904
Who are you lot?

1934
01:40:43,153 --> 01:40:45,029
We were looking for a house.

1935
01:40:45,112 --> 01:40:46,279
Real estate.

1936
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,445
Bro, ask them to come in.

1937
01:40:50,445 --> 01:40:51,445
Come in.

1938
01:40:52,404 --> 01:40:53,445
Come...

1939
01:40:54,737 --> 01:40:56,237
Hello, brothers.

1940
01:40:56,487 --> 01:40:57,696
Be seated.

1941
01:41:02,404 --> 01:41:04,529
Why have you guys come here?

1942
01:41:04,696 --> 01:41:06,362
As if the trouble there wasn't enough,

1943
01:41:06,404 --> 01:41:08,487
you had to come here too?

1944
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:11,404
Open your mouth and say something.

1945
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,153
Hey!

1946
01:41:18,404 --> 01:41:19,821
Oh, no...

1947
01:41:21,737 --> 01:41:23,529
Everyone, please step out.

1948
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:28,570
Why have you come to see Nidhi?

1949
01:41:28,696 --> 01:41:30,946
Aryan committed suicide five days ago.

1950
01:41:31,029 --> 01:41:32,404
- Huh?
- What?

1951
01:41:34,988 --> 01:41:35,988
Yes, sir.

1952
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:39,029
He came to Madurai searching for Nidhi.

1953
01:41:39,696 --> 01:41:41,737
He tried hard to find her.

1954
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:43,153
But he couldn't...

1955
01:41:43,445 --> 01:41:44,487
Overwhelmed by sadness,

1956
01:41:44,529 --> 01:41:46,946
he went home and
committed suicide five days ago.

1957
01:41:52,988 --> 01:41:55,112
Aryan really loved Nidhi.

1958
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:58,737
Come on, get up.

1959
01:42:01,696 --> 01:42:03,737
We just wanted to let you know, uncle.

1960
01:42:04,988 --> 01:42:06,612
We shall take your leave, uncle.

1961
01:42:08,153 --> 01:42:09,487
Please let everyone know.

1962
01:42:10,279 --> 01:42:11,696
He was very innocent.

1963
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:13,570
Please...

1964
01:42:13,904 --> 01:42:15,279
don't curse him...

1965
01:42:15,988 --> 01:42:17,195
Walk, you dog!

1966
01:42:17,445 --> 01:42:18,696
Alright, then.

1967
01:42:22,404 --> 01:42:23,654
Why'd you say he died?

1968
01:42:23,696 --> 01:42:24,821
Let me go! I'll tell you!

1969
01:42:24,862 --> 01:42:25,904
Tell what?

1970
01:42:25,988 --> 01:42:26,988
Calm down!

1971
01:42:27,112 --> 01:42:28,904
Why did you say such unnecessary things?

1972
01:42:28,946 --> 01:42:30,570
If I hadn't said that, you'd be done for.

1973
01:42:30,612 --> 01:42:32,320
He signalled with his eyes for the machete.

1974
01:42:34,696 --> 01:42:36,320
You don't know her well enough.

1975
01:42:36,362 --> 01:42:37,988
I suffered a lot in the car that day.

1976
01:42:38,029 --> 01:42:39,237
She's a complete lunatic.

1977
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:41,153
I'm sure she has already taken poison.

1978
01:42:41,404 --> 01:42:43,070
Now everything will be on our head.

1979
01:42:44,029 --> 01:42:45,237
Let us do one thing.

1980
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,237
We'll go to the lodge and see him.

1981
01:42:47,904 --> 01:42:49,153
Come.

1982
01:42:55,529 --> 01:42:56,529
Hey!

1983
01:42:56,737 --> 01:42:58,362
Why didn't you answer your phone?

1984
01:43:02,612 --> 01:43:04,946
I've almost figured out the area
she lives in.

1985
01:43:05,195 --> 01:43:06,529
I'll meet her tomorrow.

1986
01:43:07,404 --> 01:43:09,529
Yeah, right!
We're coming back from her house.

1987
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:10,612
Eh... And...

1988
01:43:10,696 --> 01:43:11,779
Did you meet her?

1989
01:43:11,821 --> 01:43:13,279
We met her and her dad.

1990
01:43:13,612 --> 01:43:14,904
Did she ask anything about me?

1991
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:16,821
Yes, and he told her you died.

1992
01:43:17,237 --> 01:43:19,821
If I hadn't said that,
they'd have chopped us up.

1993
01:43:20,029 --> 01:43:21,612
Her family is a terror.

1994
01:43:22,946 --> 01:43:24,320
Nixon bro... Shine...

1995
01:43:25,362 --> 01:43:26,570
I want to see her.

1996
01:43:26,696 --> 01:43:27,946
Go walk right in.

1997
01:43:27,988 --> 01:43:29,612
Her dad will chop you into pieces.

1998
01:43:42,487 --> 01:43:43,654
That was meant for you.

1999
01:43:43,737 --> 01:43:45,445
Now we're not going back
without seeing her.

2000
01:43:45,487 --> 01:43:46,654
Come on.

2001
01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:51,904
Auto, auto!

2002
01:43:54,737 --> 01:43:56,821
Those boys beat us up and escaped.

2003
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:04,112
They're over here! Come on!

2004
01:44:04,946 --> 01:44:05,946
Hey!

2005
01:44:31,029 --> 01:44:33,279
Good thing you didn't find her house.

2006
01:44:33,612 --> 01:44:35,737
They'd have cut you up and boxed you.

2007
01:44:43,237 --> 01:44:45,195
Hey, where does that bus go?

2008
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,029
It goes to Mellore GT bus stand.

2009
01:44:47,112 --> 01:44:48,696
- Is that so?
- Mellore GT last bus.

2010
01:44:48,779 --> 01:44:50,279
Kani's there now.
Ask him to find out.

2011
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,320
Okay.

2012
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:55,195
- 9, 10, 11...
- Hey!

2013
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:57,612
Weren't there three Kerala guys
at Mellore sugarcane farm?

2014
01:44:57,654 --> 01:44:58,654
No.

2015
01:44:58,696 --> 01:44:59,737
He says no.

2016
01:45:00,821 --> 01:45:02,153
From Mellore,

2017
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:03,862
a boy from Kerala had got in.

2018
01:45:03,904 --> 01:45:05,320
He kept talking in Malayalam

2019
01:45:05,362 --> 01:45:06,570
but I couldn't understand.

2020
01:45:06,946 --> 01:45:08,195
Tell me their description.

2021
01:45:08,279 --> 01:45:10,320
'One of them is short and fair.'

2022
01:45:11,112 --> 01:45:12,612
Was there a short, fair guy?

2023
01:45:12,696 --> 01:45:13,696
No.

2024
01:45:13,779 --> 01:45:15,487
And another one is short and dark.

2025
01:45:16,445 --> 01:45:17,821
Was there a short dark guy?

2026
01:45:17,862 --> 01:45:19,029
No.

2027
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:21,570
Hey, I don't think they got on this bus.

2028
01:45:21,612 --> 01:45:23,237
There was a fair handsome guy.

2029
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:27,654
'His t- shirt had a teddy bear on its back.'

2030
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:30,904
Below it...

2031
01:45:31,112 --> 01:45:32,404
A bear chasing someone...

2032
01:45:32,445 --> 01:45:34,445
I think there was a teddy bear.

2033
01:45:34,737 --> 01:45:36,029
Dad... I don't know...

2034
01:45:36,362 --> 01:45:37,362
Mom is in the Railways.

2035
01:45:37,404 --> 01:45:39,279
Bro, did we reach GT stand?

2036
01:45:39,445 --> 01:45:41,195
Wait! It's the last stop.

2037
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:42,946
We've found him!

2038
01:45:43,362 --> 01:45:45,487
What if you got slashed on the head?

2039
01:45:45,529 --> 01:45:47,946
What would we tell your parents?

2040
01:45:57,654 --> 01:45:59,362
Hey, found him.

2041
01:45:59,570 --> 01:46:02,153
Ask them to finish him off right there!

2042
01:46:07,112 --> 01:46:08,654
We found one of them!

2043
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,696
Come on!
The others must be there itself!

2044
01:46:18,362 --> 01:46:20,946
Look out for the one wearing
a black t- shirt with a teddy bear.

2045
01:46:20,988 --> 01:46:22,654
He's the one who slashed Palani bro.

2046
01:46:22,696 --> 01:46:24,029
Finish him!

2047
01:46:30,654 --> 01:46:31,862
It wasn't just one guy.

2048
01:46:31,904 --> 01:46:32,946
What are you saying?

2049
01:46:33,029 --> 01:46:34,237
There were four of them.

2050
01:46:34,279 --> 01:46:35,487
Four people?!

2051
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:38,153
They beat us both up and escaped.

2052
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,654
'- What's it?'
- A few guys I know have come here.

2053
01:46:41,696 --> 01:46:43,195
Okay. Anything bothering them?

2054
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:44,654
'Yes, it quite urgent.'

2055
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:51,404
Get out.

2056
01:46:54,821 --> 01:46:56,362
Kani, did you get them?

2057
01:46:56,404 --> 01:46:58,362
It's not three, there were four people.

2058
01:46:58,404 --> 01:46:59,904
- Four people?
- 'I didn't see.'

2059
01:46:59,988 --> 01:47:02,112
By then they beat our guys and got away.

2060
01:47:02,153 --> 01:47:03,779
We need to find that satchel!

2061
01:47:05,237 --> 01:47:06,362
Lara.

2062
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:07,988
Something important has come up.

2063
01:47:08,029 --> 01:47:09,029
Where are you?

2064
01:47:13,904 --> 01:47:15,570
It's her dad's goons.

2065
01:47:16,946 --> 01:47:18,946
Bro, we found those boys.

2066
01:47:19,487 --> 01:47:20,487
'Careful.'

2067
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:21,988
'They got a gun.'

2068
01:47:23,362 --> 01:47:24,404
Gun?!

2069
01:47:35,612 --> 01:47:36,821
Run!

2070
01:47:40,195 --> 01:47:41,988
What the hell is happening!

2071
01:47:42,404 --> 01:47:44,195
You understood her dad's range, right?

2072
01:47:44,237 --> 01:47:46,112
This is beyond our control.

2073
01:47:46,779 --> 01:47:48,612
When I saw her trembling
with fear back then,

2074
01:47:48,654 --> 01:47:50,362
I knew her dad was a gangster!

2075
01:47:50,404 --> 01:47:52,362
Whatever happens,
I'm definitely going to see her!

2076
01:47:52,404 --> 01:47:53,570
Shut up, you idiot!

2077
01:47:57,445 --> 01:47:58,737
Run!

2078
01:48:00,029 --> 01:48:01,570
Hey, Niju!

2079
01:48:02,487 --> 01:48:03,821
Nixon bro!

2080
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:14,779
Come on!

2081
01:48:15,029 --> 01:48:16,487
Run! Come!

2082
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:31,153
The meeting with Kalaidas was at 5.

2083
01:48:32,112 --> 01:48:34,946
The last thing he said on the phone
was that he had returned safely.

2084
01:48:35,487 --> 01:48:38,821
Palani has attended another meeting
after meeting Kalaidas.

2085
01:48:39,487 --> 01:48:42,570
He was dealing a red sand boa
with three Malayali boys.

2086
01:48:45,612 --> 01:48:48,696
But during the deal, it turned
out they weren't there for business.

2087
01:48:50,821 --> 01:48:53,029
Maari, they've planned something big.

2088
01:48:59,988 --> 01:49:00,988
Maari.

2089
01:49:01,946 --> 01:49:03,279
Maari, listen to me.

2090
01:49:03,487 --> 01:49:04,487
Hey...

2091
01:49:04,862 --> 01:49:06,320
Where's it? Where's the item?

2092
01:49:06,362 --> 01:49:07,988
Where's it, huh? Where?!

2093
01:49:08,029 --> 01:49:10,195
Those Kerala boys took it.

2094
01:49:11,737 --> 01:49:13,487
What they hell were you all doing, huh?

2095
01:49:13,862 --> 01:49:16,654
It's going to be a big problem
if we don't find it.

2096
01:49:16,696 --> 01:49:17,988
I need it!

2097
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:20,070
- I need that satchel!
- We'll find it, Maari, you go now!

2098
01:49:20,112 --> 01:49:21,570
Come on, start the car!

2099
01:49:23,529 --> 01:49:24,612
What's happening?

2100
01:49:24,696 --> 01:49:25,946
Did you find those boys?

2101
01:49:25,988 --> 01:49:28,696
No, they're hiding somewhere near GT stand.

2102
01:49:28,779 --> 01:49:30,237
Our men are looking for them.

2103
01:49:30,279 --> 01:49:31,279
We'll find them!

2104
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:33,696
Search every nook and corner.

2105
01:49:33,737 --> 01:49:35,696
No one should leave our area and get away!

2106
01:49:35,737 --> 01:49:36,779
We'll nab them.

2107
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:38,779
We'll definitely catch hold of them.

2108
01:49:54,445 --> 01:49:55,696
Hey, stop!

2109
01:49:56,904 --> 01:49:57,904
Reverse, reverse!

2110
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:05,529
Look if anyone's there.

2111
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,612
Hey! Wha...

2112
01:50:21,904 --> 01:50:23,029
Who are you!

2113
01:50:25,988 --> 01:50:27,112
Get in!

2114
01:50:39,153 --> 01:50:40,279
Run!

2115
01:50:43,112 --> 01:50:44,487
Hey, come on!

2116
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:49,904
- Go quickly!
- Hey, come this way!

2117
01:50:51,029 --> 01:50:52,112
Where to...

2118
01:50:52,237 --> 01:50:54,529
Call everyone we know in Madurai

2119
01:50:54,570 --> 01:50:56,404
and ask them to come out and search!

2120
01:50:56,445 --> 01:50:57,988
Tell them to check every single place.

2121
01:50:58,029 --> 01:50:59,237
Kill if they have to!

2122
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:00,862
I need that satchel!

2123
01:51:07,946 --> 01:51:10,404
Why did that guy
make such a stupid decision?

2124
01:51:11,029 --> 01:51:13,696
Does he have no responsibility
towards his family or what?

2125
01:51:16,445 --> 01:51:19,029
What makes you think
you can talk about responsibility?

2126
01:51:20,737 --> 01:51:22,821
You're talking about his parents' feelings.

2127
01:51:24,112 --> 01:51:26,404
Do you not value my feelings?

2128
01:51:29,195 --> 01:51:31,570
Mom, why didn't you try for
another child after having me?

2129
01:51:31,737 --> 01:51:32,779
Tell me!

2130
01:51:32,821 --> 01:51:33,821
Tell me why, Mom!

2131
01:51:33,946 --> 01:51:34,946
Tell me, Dad!

2132
01:51:34,988 --> 01:51:35,862
Tell!

2133
01:51:35,904 --> 01:51:37,445
I was a burden for you.

2134
01:51:37,487 --> 01:51:38,654
It's not what you think!

2135
01:51:38,696 --> 01:51:40,029
Don't lie!

2136
01:51:41,529 --> 01:51:42,570
Nidhi...

2137
01:51:43,988 --> 01:51:46,612
I've been listening to everything
you said since I was 13.

2138
01:51:47,487 --> 01:51:49,904
Go there, go here! Sit here, sit there!

2139
01:51:50,487 --> 01:51:51,988
So that everyone in the family says,

2140
01:51:52,029 --> 01:51:54,487
"Wow, what a disciplined child!"

2141
01:51:55,529 --> 01:51:57,570
You don't care about anything else!

2142
01:51:59,029 --> 01:52:00,320
Even my studies...

2143
01:52:00,988 --> 01:52:02,862
I'm doing what you like!

2144
01:52:07,821 --> 01:52:09,946
You only think about yourselves.

2145
01:52:10,404 --> 01:52:12,779
You don't care about anyone else.

2146
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:36,404
Hey!

2147
01:52:36,487 --> 01:52:38,696
I know you guys are here.

2148
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:42,195
If you come out yourselves, I'll talk.

2149
01:52:42,487 --> 01:52:43,570
If not...

2150
01:52:43,696 --> 01:52:45,445
I'll come catch you myself...

2151
01:52:46,612 --> 01:52:48,654
and cut off your tongues first!

2152
01:52:48,862 --> 01:52:50,445
And then only I'll talk!

2153
01:52:56,029 --> 01:52:57,445
Hey...

2154
01:52:59,779 --> 01:53:01,029
Do you know Palani?

2155
01:53:01,946 --> 01:53:02,988
Hey, you!

2156
01:53:03,029 --> 01:53:04,696
Do you know Palani?

2157
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:07,862
There's a big gang after him.

2158
01:53:08,362 --> 01:53:10,862
How did you barge in so easily
and attack him?

2159
01:53:14,696 --> 01:53:15,988
I'm a very valuable person here!

2160
01:53:16,029 --> 01:53:17,445
Do you know, huh?

2161
01:53:28,696 --> 01:53:30,529
Where's the satchel that you stole?

2162
01:53:32,195 --> 01:53:33,612
Where's the satchel, huh?

2163
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:35,570
Don't stay silent, spit it out!

2164
01:53:37,445 --> 01:53:38,654
They're going to kill him.

2165
01:53:39,112 --> 01:53:41,320
Speak up! Stay silent and you die!

2166
01:53:44,696 --> 01:53:45,737
Where's the satchel?

2167
01:53:46,445 --> 01:53:47,570
That boy, Aryan...

2168
01:53:48,029 --> 01:53:50,237
The love you two never gave me...

2169
01:53:50,445 --> 01:53:51,988
In that short time...

2170
01:53:52,404 --> 01:53:54,654
I got so much love from him.

2171
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:58,946
Actually, I've no feelings for him at all.

2172
01:54:00,946 --> 01:54:03,737
I didn't get into his car to go
roaming around town.

2173
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:05,946
I didn't have the courage...

2174
01:54:06,195 --> 01:54:08,029
to face my parents...

2175
01:54:09,904 --> 01:54:10,904
That's why...

2176
01:54:10,946 --> 01:54:13,362
I went along with him, my head blank...

2177
01:54:16,988 --> 01:54:18,153
Where's the satchel?

2178
01:54:18,195 --> 01:54:20,946
Bro...
it was three of my friends who went...

2179
01:54:20,988 --> 01:54:22,279
I didn't even go.

2180
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:24,904
Where are your friends?

2181
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,237
Where are you lot hiding, huh?

2182
01:54:44,445 --> 01:54:46,904
I last saw him in the ICU.

2183
01:54:50,029 --> 01:54:51,988
And I could see it in his eyes...

2184
01:54:53,112 --> 01:54:54,946
The love he has for me...

2185
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:57,237
Bro... I know...

2186
01:54:57,612 --> 01:54:59,112
Her dad sent you all, right?

2187
01:54:59,195 --> 01:55:01,279
I wanted to see her until now...

2188
01:55:01,487 --> 01:55:03,279
Now I don't wanna see her anymore!

2189
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:04,529
Nothing! Please, bro...

2190
01:55:04,862 --> 01:55:06,195
I'll go back.

2191
01:55:06,237 --> 01:55:08,696
He gave up his life for me...

2192
01:55:09,862 --> 01:55:12,445
What have you guys given me?

2193
01:55:12,529 --> 01:55:13,946
No, dear... not like that...

2194
01:55:14,988 --> 01:55:16,946
- Tell me, Mom...
- It's not like that, dear...

2195
01:55:18,195 --> 01:55:19,487
Tell me...

2196
01:55:19,696 --> 01:55:20,696
Tell...

2197
01:55:20,737 --> 01:55:22,112
- Tell!!!
- No, Nidhi.

2198
01:55:24,612 --> 01:55:26,195
- Please hear us out, Nidhi...
- Please, dear...

2199
01:55:26,237 --> 01:55:27,237
Hello.

2200
01:55:27,696 --> 01:55:29,029
Sorry for the disturbance.

2201
01:55:29,153 --> 01:55:30,195
Yo!

2202
01:55:30,279 --> 01:55:32,112
Are you such bad parents?

2203
01:55:32,612 --> 01:55:34,612
If not you, who else will take care of her?

2204
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,612
Look how she is crying.

2205
01:55:37,904 --> 01:55:40,029
Aunty, even you're a woman.

2206
01:55:41,779 --> 01:55:44,696
Lara, we've found a way
to save you from Maari.

2207
01:55:45,195 --> 01:55:47,445
The four Malayali guys who killed Palani

2208
01:55:47,487 --> 01:55:48,988
came here searching for a girl.

2209
01:55:49,029 --> 01:55:50,153
You nab that girl.

2210
01:55:50,195 --> 01:55:52,404
That way, we can hand those boys
over to Maari.

2211
01:55:52,445 --> 01:55:53,487
This is a great chance.

2212
01:55:53,529 --> 01:55:56,029
You and Maari can leave everything behind
and be at peace.

2213
01:55:57,362 --> 01:55:58,362
Let's go?

2214
01:55:59,612 --> 01:56:00,612
Hey!

2215
01:56:01,029 --> 01:56:02,904
The girl those boys were searching for,

2216
01:56:03,029 --> 01:56:04,445
she's with me.

2217
01:56:04,529 --> 01:56:05,737
Tell Maari.

2218
01:56:11,112 --> 01:56:13,946
Call those boys
and tell them to come to your house.

2219
01:56:14,529 --> 01:56:16,153
Keep an eye on them.

2220
01:56:16,445 --> 01:56:17,654
We found that girl.

2221
01:56:17,696 --> 01:56:19,362
'I'll come to your house with her.'

2222
01:56:23,195 --> 01:56:24,070
Okay

2223
01:56:24,112 --> 01:56:26,404
Lara, for now just take that girl
around the city.

2224
01:56:26,487 --> 01:56:28,737
When I say so,
bring her to the address I send.

2225
01:56:41,237 --> 01:56:43,279
Come to the tractor mill near GT stand.

2226
01:56:44,612 --> 01:56:46,029
We've found them.

2227
01:56:50,279 --> 01:56:52,904
Do you have any idea where you are
or who you just laid hands on?

2228
01:56:57,153 --> 01:56:58,279
Where's the satchel?

2229
01:56:58,320 --> 01:56:59,362
Where's the satchel?

2230
01:56:59,404 --> 01:57:00,696
Where's the satchel?

2231
01:57:00,779 --> 01:57:03,404
Bro, please let go... please...

2232
01:57:04,237 --> 01:57:05,612
Give me that knife!

2233
01:57:08,404 --> 01:57:09,696
Please don't....

2234
01:57:09,737 --> 01:57:11,237
No...

2235
01:57:17,153 --> 01:57:18,362
Where's the satchel??

2236
01:57:21,404 --> 01:57:22,612
You!

2237
01:57:23,862 --> 01:57:25,445
Open your mouth and speak!

2238
01:57:26,988 --> 01:57:29,153
Nixon bro,
I think he's asking about the guy

2239
01:57:29,195 --> 01:57:31,195
you beat up and threw in the gutter.

2240
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:34,862
Hey, you!

2241
01:57:34,904 --> 01:57:35,946
Tell me where!

2242
01:57:35,988 --> 01:57:38,779
Bro, he came to slash me for no reason.

2243
01:57:39,195 --> 01:57:40,904
That's why I beat him up.

2244
01:57:40,988 --> 01:57:42,904
- Sorry, bro...
- No, no!

2245
01:57:42,946 --> 01:57:44,320
The satchel! The satchel!

2246
01:57:44,362 --> 01:57:45,696
The bag! The bag!

2247
01:57:51,946 --> 01:57:53,112
Isn't that Balu's vehicle?

2248
01:57:53,195 --> 01:57:54,862
- Yes.
- Go upstairs and check.

2249
01:58:02,445 --> 01:58:04,529
Watch him die right in front of you!

2250
01:58:04,988 --> 01:58:05,988
Bro...

2251
01:58:06,029 --> 01:58:07,404
After hitting him...

2252
01:58:07,696 --> 01:58:10,195
we took an auto
and left that place immediately.

2253
01:58:10,237 --> 01:58:11,612
I don't know anything else.

2254
01:58:14,779 --> 01:58:16,654
- Tell me.
- Ravi has caught those boys.

2255
01:58:16,696 --> 01:58:17,904
They're at GT mills right now.

2256
01:58:17,946 --> 01:58:19,279
- Found them?
- Yes!

2257
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:21,320
- Coming!
- Come quick.

2258
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:24,779
Come on.

2259
01:58:25,654 --> 01:58:26,946
Hey... Upstairs...

2260
01:58:27,112 --> 01:58:28,612
- Up...
- What's upstairs?

2261
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,612
Hey...

2262
01:58:36,029 --> 01:58:38,570
Maari's gang, all mighty and strong!

2263
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:40,696
Yet four guys attacked their very core.

2264
01:58:41,237 --> 01:58:42,946
And they're just kids in diapers!

2265
01:58:43,029 --> 01:58:45,487
You needed Ravi to nab them!

2266
01:58:45,988 --> 01:58:47,029
Got it now?

2267
01:58:53,237 --> 01:58:55,029
- Who are these people?
- What do you mean who?

2268
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:56,404
Hey, hey!

2269
01:58:58,612 --> 01:59:02,153
The Madurai gang who killed Palani
and ran away with his satchel.

2270
01:59:02,279 --> 01:59:03,237
Boys!

2271
01:59:03,279 --> 01:59:04,320
The boys!

2272
01:59:05,862 --> 01:59:07,195
Now do you realise...

2273
01:59:08,737 --> 01:59:09,946
that this Ravi...

2274
01:59:10,112 --> 01:59:11,570
is so damn valuable!

2275
01:59:11,654 --> 01:59:12,779
Stupid moron!

2276
01:59:13,279 --> 01:59:16,070
This is why everyone calls you Moron Ravi!

2277
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,279
These guys weren't the ones who were there.

2278
01:59:23,612 --> 01:59:24,320
What?

2279
01:59:24,362 --> 01:59:26,529
Giri, come to Vasantham Lodge quickly.

2280
01:59:26,654 --> 01:59:29,195
- Why?
- Those guys have been hanged.

2281
01:59:33,029 --> 01:59:34,029
What are you saying?

2282
01:59:34,112 --> 01:59:36,320
Something feels very off.

2283
01:59:39,988 --> 01:59:41,029
Hey!

2284
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:42,612
Shucks!

2285
01:59:45,988 --> 01:59:47,988
Go and look for it!

2286
01:59:48,195 --> 01:59:49,862
I don't care how, I need that satchel.

2287
01:59:49,904 --> 01:59:52,696
- Ask everyone to be present there!
- Search everywhere!

2288
01:59:52,737 --> 01:59:54,112
Everybody, come to Vasantham Lodge.

2289
01:59:54,153 --> 01:59:55,737
That satchel should be there itself.

2290
01:59:55,862 --> 01:59:57,362
This doesn't feel normal at all.

2291
01:59:57,445 --> 01:59:59,153
This seems like a big sketch.

2292
01:59:59,362 --> 02:00:00,612
Be alert!

2293
02:00:03,737 --> 02:00:05,029
Come quickly.

2294
02:00:09,737 --> 02:00:11,612
Looks like we got the wrong guys.

2295
02:00:12,195 --> 02:00:13,195
Get going!

2296
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:14,862
Everyone, back in the cars.

2297
02:00:15,237 --> 02:00:16,612
Look everywhere!

2298
02:00:16,654 --> 02:00:18,112
Check the other room.

2299
02:00:18,654 --> 02:00:19,654
Bro...

2300
02:00:19,904 --> 02:00:21,029
Hm?

2301
02:00:24,487 --> 02:00:25,654
Niju...

2302
02:00:27,362 --> 02:00:30,487
We came here looking for a friend.

2303
02:00:35,029 --> 02:00:37,529
Why'd you beat us up so mercilessly?

2304
02:00:39,946 --> 02:00:42,237
Go and look!
Search every single room!

2305
02:00:46,029 --> 02:00:47,195
Sorry... Go on now.

2306
02:00:47,821 --> 02:00:50,153
You treated us like dirt, huh!

2307
02:01:10,112 --> 02:01:11,320
I can't breathe!

2308
02:01:12,487 --> 02:01:13,487
You!

2309
02:01:14,487 --> 02:01:15,654
Ravi anna!

2310
02:01:16,362 --> 02:01:18,237
Looks like it is poisonous gas!

2311
02:01:18,445 --> 02:01:19,946
Get out! Go, go!

2312
02:01:20,445 --> 02:01:22,988
You went after her because I told you to!

2313
02:01:23,112 --> 02:01:24,654
And I'm telling you again!

2314
02:01:24,696 --> 02:01:26,570
Even if we don't get to see her...

2315
02:01:26,612 --> 02:01:28,237
We'll only step back in Unnikulam

2316
02:01:28,279 --> 02:01:29,946
after we've beaten those who beat us.

2317
02:01:29,988 --> 02:01:31,737
Come and beat the hell out of them!

2318
02:01:33,654 --> 02:01:34,946
Beat them!

2319
02:01:45,612 --> 02:01:47,237
Chop off their heads!

2320
02:02:27,570 --> 02:02:28,946
Throw it!

2321
02:02:36,029 --> 02:02:36,904
Tell me.

2322
02:02:36,946 --> 02:02:38,779
'Looks like those boys planned something.'

2323
02:02:38,988 --> 02:02:40,112
'Don't go inside.'

2324
02:02:40,445 --> 02:02:42,029
'Whatever happens, don't go inside.'

2325
02:02:42,279 --> 02:02:43,946
I'm already inside the lodge.

2326
02:03:08,988 --> 02:03:11,570
You lot look like school boys!

2327
02:03:12,112 --> 02:03:14,112
Where's the satchel
you stole from Palani's car?

2328
02:03:14,279 --> 02:03:16,279
We didn't want to steal the satchel
from the car,

2329
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:18,237
it was a bait to get you here.

2330
02:03:18,279 --> 02:03:19,445
You!

2331
02:03:27,821 --> 02:03:30,529
I hit those four boys
without knowing who they were.

2332
02:03:32,737 --> 02:03:33,737
But now...

2333
02:03:34,029 --> 02:03:36,362
They're hitting me even though
they know who I am!

2334
02:03:38,529 --> 02:03:39,862
Don't let them go!

2335
02:03:40,029 --> 02:03:41,529
Grab all of them!

2336
02:03:41,821 --> 02:03:42,821
Come on!

2337
02:03:42,862 --> 02:03:44,779
Where the hell is my satchel?

2338
02:04:31,195 --> 02:04:32,195
Hello.

2339
02:04:32,362 --> 02:04:33,654
I'm at the end of the street.

2340
02:04:36,237 --> 02:04:37,821
I'll check and tell you.

2341
02:04:39,195 --> 02:04:40,279
Here...

2342
02:04:41,696 --> 02:04:42,862
Take that knife.

2343
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:44,654
Take it!

2344
02:04:47,821 --> 02:04:48,821
Take it, man!

2345
02:04:55,612 --> 02:04:57,029
Does it hurt?

2346
02:04:58,445 --> 02:04:59,904
Tell me where's the satchel?

2347
02:04:59,946 --> 02:05:01,570
Damn it, just say it!

2348
02:05:01,654 --> 02:05:03,153
Where have you kept that satchel?

2349
02:05:03,195 --> 02:05:04,362
Tell me!

2350
02:05:14,237 --> 02:05:15,404
Hold him!

2351
02:05:16,988 --> 02:05:17,779
Tell me.

2352
02:05:17,821 --> 02:05:20,279
Ramana has been here for the past 14 days.

2353
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:23,029
He has booked the whole of
Vasantham Lodge for some work.

2354
02:05:23,153 --> 02:05:24,821
He has come here with a team.

2355
02:05:25,112 --> 02:05:26,279
Ramana?

2356
02:05:26,696 --> 02:05:27,821
How's that possible?

2357
02:05:29,112 --> 02:05:30,904
He died and turned to ashes.

2358
02:05:37,946 --> 02:05:38,946
Hey...

2359
02:05:43,029 --> 02:05:44,029
Whoa...

2360
02:05:44,153 --> 02:05:45,153
It was you...

2361
02:05:46,696 --> 02:05:48,362
So, this was your sketch.

2362
02:05:50,946 --> 02:05:53,112
Your life is my mercy.

2363
02:05:53,946 --> 02:05:56,279
That mercy is gonna go waste now.

2364
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:02,904
That day, in that incident...

2365
02:06:03,904 --> 02:06:05,153
I died...

2366
02:06:06,112 --> 02:06:07,612
What remains now is just a shell.

2367
02:06:09,779 --> 02:06:12,153
You tortured my 12- year old daughter...

2368
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:15,737
I can still hear the sound
every single day.

2369
02:06:18,153 --> 02:06:20,195
You destroyed my whole family...

2370
02:06:20,862 --> 02:06:21,946
You!

2371
02:06:24,153 --> 02:06:25,988
You shouldn't die so easily!

2372
02:06:28,612 --> 02:06:31,195
I'll cut your head off
and hang it for my whole village to see!

2373
02:06:32,821 --> 02:06:35,070
Only then will the souls
of my wife and kids find peace.

2374
02:06:40,779 --> 02:06:42,654
Come on, fast!

2375
02:06:46,279 --> 02:06:47,404
Close the door.

2376
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,153
Where's all this confidence from?

2377
02:06:51,529 --> 02:06:53,237
You think you can get out of here alive

2378
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:54,946
after taking down all my men?

2379
02:06:54,988 --> 02:06:55,988
You!

2380
02:06:56,946 --> 02:06:59,320
To kill your Palani, steal that satchel

2381
02:06:59,362 --> 02:07:01,612
and wipe out all your men,
I just need four guys!

2382
02:07:05,821 --> 02:07:06,988
What are you looking at, huh?

2383
02:07:08,404 --> 02:07:10,153
That there are only three of them?

2384
02:07:11,320 --> 02:07:12,696
It's not just three of them.

2385
02:07:12,946 --> 02:07:13,946
There's one more guy.

2386
02:07:15,779 --> 02:07:17,153
Who's that?

2387
02:07:23,696 --> 02:07:24,862
His name is Danny.

2388
02:07:24,946 --> 02:07:26,570
He's quite a troublesome guy.

2389
02:07:33,529 --> 02:07:35,404
These boys are from Angamaly.

2390
02:07:45,696 --> 02:07:47,279
Their first attempt...

2391
02:07:49,029 --> 02:07:50,320
was a perfect attempt!

2392
02:07:59,612 --> 02:08:02,654
Be it them or anyone else
who comes for you,

2393
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:05,237
no one can escape my area!

2394
02:08:05,570 --> 02:08:07,195
Not this area, not any area…

2395
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:09,529
And after all this,
you still don't believe?

2396
02:08:10,696 --> 02:08:11,696
No...

2397
02:08:11,737 --> 02:08:12,779
I need his head.

2398
02:08:13,946 --> 02:08:16,029
Drag him down!

2399
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:24,153
Come on! Hit them!

2400
02:08:40,445 --> 02:08:41,529
Run!

2401
02:08:41,570 --> 02:08:42,737
Don't let them escape.

2402
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:44,279
- Kill all of them.
- Run

2403
02:08:50,445 --> 02:08:51,821
Open the door.

2404
02:08:53,570 --> 02:08:55,195
What the hell do you want, huh?

2405
02:08:58,904 --> 02:09:00,445
Oh, no! Which way?!

2406
02:09:00,487 --> 02:09:02,195
Run till you reach the bus stand!

2407
02:09:27,862 --> 02:09:29,029
Hey!

2408
02:09:29,612 --> 02:09:31,487
Why won't he answer his phone!

2409
02:09:31,946 --> 02:09:32,946
Ugh!

2410
02:09:37,529 --> 02:09:38,570
Hey dude.

2411
02:09:39,404 --> 02:09:41,779
You think I'm kidnapping you?

2412
02:09:42,029 --> 02:09:43,237
Nope!

2413
02:09:43,612 --> 02:09:45,654
I liked you the moment I saw you.

2414
02:09:48,904 --> 02:09:50,029
Aren't you sleepy?

2415
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:52,570
Wait.

2416
02:10:04,279 --> 02:10:05,362
Jump!

2417
02:10:29,821 --> 02:10:31,570
"Listen..."

2418
02:10:42,237 --> 02:10:44,529
Hey, what happened to your Maari?

2419
02:10:44,821 --> 02:10:46,904
Three small boys are carrying him upstairs.

2420
02:10:46,946 --> 02:10:48,279
Should I attack?

2421
02:10:48,487 --> 02:10:49,487
Don't.

2422
02:10:49,529 --> 02:10:51,195
Those boys aren't what you think they are.

2423
02:10:51,237 --> 02:10:52,737
'They're very dangerous.'

2424
02:10:52,779 --> 02:10:54,821
I'm also looking for a way to escape.

2425
02:10:54,862 --> 02:10:56,445
We unnecessarily got into this mess!

2426
02:10:56,862 --> 02:10:57,862
Hey!

2427
02:10:58,029 --> 02:11:00,320
I think I'm in love with this girl.

2428
02:11:00,696 --> 02:11:01,904
- That's why...
- You!

2429
02:11:02,195 --> 02:11:04,195
You feel the same with everyone you see.

2430
02:11:04,237 --> 02:11:05,237
Stupid guy!

2431
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:06,529
'Don't jump into trouble!'

2432
02:11:06,612 --> 02:11:08,237
Those boys are very dangerous.

2433
02:11:08,279 --> 02:11:10,904
Try to escape or you'll be done for!

2434
02:11:12,112 --> 02:11:13,153
Shucks!

2435
02:11:13,237 --> 02:11:15,279
What unlucky moment did my dad conceive me!

2436
02:11:15,904 --> 02:11:17,320
No girl ever falls for me!

2437
02:11:17,404 --> 02:11:18,404
Pah!

2438
02:11:21,029 --> 02:11:22,946
You won't leave this place alive...

2439
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:24,862
- Shut up!
- You'll die.

2440
02:11:37,570 --> 02:11:38,570
Hey...

2441
02:11:38,612 --> 02:11:40,696
You ended up falling in love
with these guys of all people!

2442
02:11:40,737 --> 02:11:43,029
I thought this is a love story
but it's full of violence!

2443
02:11:43,112 --> 02:11:44,654
Get going! Go, go!

2444
02:11:48,404 --> 02:11:49,570
I'll take it off.

2445
02:11:50,988 --> 02:11:53,487
Uncle, can you drop me home?

2446
02:11:53,654 --> 02:11:54,696
Uncle?!

2447
02:11:54,737 --> 02:11:56,445
You think I brought you here for a tour?

2448
02:11:56,487 --> 02:11:57,529
Get lost!

2449
02:11:58,570 --> 02:12:00,112
Hey, go that way!

2450
02:12:00,445 --> 02:12:01,612
Get out and close the door.

2451
02:12:03,029 --> 02:12:04,404
All the feelings

2452
02:12:04,612 --> 02:12:06,529
I had for her face have vanished.

2453
02:12:11,487 --> 02:12:12,529
Let's go!

2454
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,737
Get in! Get in!

2455
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,654
Go!

2456
02:12:34,237 --> 02:12:36,445
"I've fallen in love"

2457
02:12:36,696 --> 02:12:38,779
"Lost in the universe of you"

2458
02:12:39,112 --> 02:12:41,153
"What sorcery has changed me?"

2459
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:43,821
"I wander as a Romeo"

2460
02:12:47,029 --> 02:12:49,029
"My lovely angel"

2461
02:12:49,404 --> 02:12:51,362
"After I saw you"

2462
02:12:51,779 --> 02:12:53,779
"Longing my heart"

2463
02:12:54,487 --> 02:12:56,320
"To go close to you"

2464
02:12:56,612 --> 02:12:58,445
"The swift of breeze"

2465
02:12:58,988 --> 02:13:00,988
"Is entering into my heart"

2466
02:13:01,404 --> 02:13:03,404
"And encircling me"

2467
02:13:03,779 --> 02:13:05,821
"You are my lovely angel"

2468
02:13:25,487 --> 02:13:27,195
Hey, drive carefully!

2469
02:13:40,237 --> 02:13:43,029
This marriage such a nerve- wracking thing.

2470
02:13:45,988 --> 02:13:47,862
That's why I don't even think about it.

2471
02:13:49,445 --> 02:13:50,445
Here you go.

2472
02:13:53,821 --> 02:13:56,362
- Yes, bro... tell me.
- Need to hit the gym and work on my body.

2473
02:13:56,404 --> 02:13:58,904
- Yes, man...
- The girl in green salwar was eyeing me.

2474
02:14:09,862 --> 02:14:12,195
- Nice...
- Bro, got the house keys?

2475
02:14:12,237 --> 02:14:13,696
It's next to the shoes.

2476
02:14:13,779 --> 02:14:15,821
It's time for the ceremony.
Where are you going?

2477
02:15:19,029 --> 02:15:20,237
You idiot...

2478
02:15:21,195 --> 02:15:22,737
I loved you to live with you,

2479
02:15:22,779 --> 02:15:24,487
not to die with you...

2480
02:15:37,737 --> 02:15:39,362
You look amazing in this dress.

2481
02:15:41,112 --> 02:15:42,737
How are you? Good?

2482
02:15:43,612 --> 02:15:44,862
I'm great.

2483
02:15:45,362 --> 02:15:47,487
I was on an all- India trip
for the last 40 days.

2484
02:15:48,487 --> 02:15:50,487
Since none of us knew each other,

2485
02:15:50,862 --> 02:15:52,862
it felt like we'd known
each other for years.

2486
02:15:53,029 --> 02:15:55,237
Seeing this place on the list,
you came to mind first.

2487
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:58,195
But I never thought I'd get to meet you.

2488
02:15:59,029 --> 02:16:00,320
How are you?

2489
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:04,279
Hey...

2490
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,821
Why are you so quiet?

2491
02:16:06,362 --> 02:16:09,737
Did the stalker Aryan I knew
lose all his energy in that accident?

2492
02:16:09,862 --> 02:16:10,862
Huh?

2493
02:16:11,862 --> 02:16:13,112
You've changed a lot.

2494
02:16:15,237 --> 02:16:16,570
You've also changed, Nidhi.

2495
02:16:18,696 --> 02:16:19,696
What did you say?

2496
02:16:19,737 --> 02:16:20,737
Repeat it.

2497
02:16:20,946 --> 02:16:22,570
You've become someone else.

2498
02:16:24,487 --> 02:16:25,737
Oh, that...

2499
02:16:27,988 --> 02:16:31,362
I always kept my dreams
and happiness to myself.

2500
02:16:32,737 --> 02:16:34,862
Now I'm living for my
dreams and happiness.

2501
02:16:35,487 --> 02:16:36,988
Maybe, that's the reason.

2502
02:16:38,737 --> 02:16:41,237
Was I ever a part of your dreams
and happiness?

2503
02:16:42,029 --> 02:16:43,696
Wait, wait... Speak slowly.

2504
02:16:45,112 --> 02:16:46,862
Did you ever love me?

2505
02:16:54,862 --> 02:16:55,946
Nope.

2506
02:16:59,029 --> 02:17:01,487
I used to wonder
if you'd ever come looking for me.

2507
02:17:02,112 --> 02:17:03,737
But thank God you didn't.

2508
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:06,988
You hold a big space in my life, Aryan.

2509
02:17:08,237 --> 02:17:10,445
But I don't know if it's love.

2510
02:17:12,862 --> 02:17:14,362
I did think about it.

2511
02:17:16,612 --> 02:17:19,153
But I realised my life
is more important than you.

2512
02:17:20,737 --> 02:17:22,862
The last sound I ever heard was of yours.

2513
02:17:24,362 --> 02:17:26,487
You were the one who told me to live.

2514
02:17:29,029 --> 02:17:30,237
I'm living.

2515
02:17:32,362 --> 02:17:34,487
I lost my hearing in the accident.

2516
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:46,320
Even with all this noise around,

2517
02:17:46,362 --> 02:17:48,237
I can only feel the vibration.

2518
02:17:50,362 --> 02:17:52,112
Still I'm very happy.

2519
02:17:54,487 --> 02:17:55,570
It's like I...

2520
02:17:55,737 --> 02:17:57,988
I found a new world!

2521
02:18:00,112 --> 02:18:02,112
If you hadn't come into my life...

2522
02:18:02,988 --> 02:18:05,112
I'd still be that old Nidhi.

2523
02:18:07,612 --> 02:18:09,362
Even though I lost my hearing...

2524
02:18:10,737 --> 02:18:12,696
I like this Nidhi better.

2525
02:18:14,862 --> 02:18:16,195
Thank you, Aryan.

2526
02:18:17,029 --> 02:18:18,487
Thank you for everything.

2527
02:18:19,570 --> 02:18:21,362
Thank you for all this happiness.

2528
02:18:21,904 --> 02:18:23,904
I'm so happy I got to see you.

2529
02:18:25,070 --> 02:18:26,570
I hope you are happy too.

2530
02:18:29,654 --> 02:18:32,529
The best feeling is seeing
the people we love happy...

2531
02:18:33,529 --> 02:18:35,654
isn't that the greatest happiness?

2532
02:19:30,279 --> 02:19:31,696
If you don't die here...

2533
02:19:31,737 --> 02:19:32,988
remember one thing...

2534
02:19:35,529 --> 02:19:37,487
Don't bottle up your dreams...

2535
02:19:37,529 --> 02:19:39,153
because you're afraid of your parents.

2536
02:19:40,029 --> 02:19:41,737
Live for yourself...

2537
02:19:42,862 --> 02:19:44,029
Okay?

2538
02:19:49,029 --> 02:19:50,029
Nidhi...

2539
02:19:51,487 --> 02:19:53,612
I promise I won't come after you again...

2540
02:19:56,862 --> 02:19:58,320
But I will wait...

2541
02:20:03,362 --> 02:20:04,529
'Nidhi...'

2542
02:20:05,404 --> 02:20:07,654
'I was searching for you
to tell you all this...'

2543
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:11,612
'But this is how we ended up meeting...'

2544
02:20:26,821 --> 02:20:27,946
Like everyone else,

2545
02:20:27,988 --> 02:20:29,988
I dreamed of living my life
with the girl I loved.

2546
02:20:30,737 --> 02:20:32,779
But even though
that dream never came true...

2547
02:20:33,404 --> 02:20:34,862
I am genuinely happy.

2548
02:20:35,904 --> 02:20:38,362
Love isn't just about making her mine.

2549
02:20:39,821 --> 02:20:41,320
I just want her to be happy.

2550
02:20:46,737 --> 02:20:48,696
If you ask me whether my love story

2551
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:51,821
had a happy ending or a sad one...

2552
02:20:53,237 --> 02:20:55,070
For me… it was a happy ending.

2553
02:21:04,821 --> 02:21:07,570
What is this? A protest over
your wedding not happening?

2554
02:21:13,779 --> 02:21:15,320
Brothers and sisters.

2555
02:21:15,404 --> 02:21:17,029
The Word of God says,

2556
02:21:17,070 --> 02:21:19,612
"Love your father and mother."

2557
02:21:19,654 --> 02:21:24,112
Without their blessings,
our lives can never truly prosper.

2558
02:21:24,153 --> 02:21:26,529
Likewise, those who fall
into the trap of marijuana...

2559
02:21:26,791 --> 02:21:28,927
- Hallelujah!
- ...are not only destroying their own lives

2560
02:21:28,952 --> 02:21:30,724
but also the lives of their families.

2561
02:21:30,749 --> 02:21:31,874
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

2562
02:21:31,899 --> 02:21:33,066
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

2563
02:21:33,091 --> 02:21:34,674
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

2564
02:21:35,716 --> 02:21:37,341
Everyone else has moved forward in life.

2565
02:21:37,587 --> 02:21:39,754
Mom has even started talking about
my sister's marriage.

2566
02:21:39,779 --> 02:21:42,254
How long can I keep
living off my brother?

2567
02:21:42,279 --> 02:21:43,570
Now he has a family too.

2568
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:45,947
Shouldn't we at least try to
make it in life?

2569
02:21:47,755 --> 02:21:50,254
Hope is the only thing
stronger than fear.

2570
02:21:51,880 --> 02:21:53,294
You know, right?

2571
02:21:53,319 --> 02:21:55,237
I only buy dresses that are unique pieces.

2572
02:21:55,262 --> 02:21:56,387
Yeah, right.

2573
02:22:01,907 --> 02:22:04,740
Ever since they took that satchel from us…

2574
02:22:04,779 --> 02:22:07,821
everyone's lost their trust, fear
and respect for us.

2575
02:22:08,029 --> 02:22:11,195
Before finishing off Ramana,
I should've taken them out first.

2576
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:13,696
But they got caught in a case
and landed in jail.

2577
02:22:44,112 --> 02:22:45,737
Did you think everything was over?

2578
02:22:47,445 --> 02:22:48,821
Where's that sa-

2579
02:23:21,445 --> 02:23:23,445
Are you here for revenge?

2580
02:23:24,029 --> 02:23:25,529
This ends here!

2581
02:23:25,821 --> 02:23:27,904
This has no prequel and no sequel!

2582
02:23:38,821 --> 02:23:40,821
"Delhi, Bombay, Kalpetta"

2583
02:23:40,862 --> 02:23:42,988
"On the road to Madurai we wander"

2584
02:23:43,029 --> 02:23:44,737
"As I travel these miles"

2585
02:23:44,779 --> 02:23:46,362
"I feel so distant, almost like I'm dead"

2586
02:23:46,612 --> 02:23:48,487
"Delhi, Bombay, Kalpetta"

2587
02:23:48,529 --> 02:23:50,445
"On the road to Madurai we wander"

2588
02:23:50,487 --> 02:23:52,195
"As I travel these miles"

2589
02:23:52,237 --> 02:23:54,487
"I feel so distant, almost like I'm dead"

2590
02:24:10,237 --> 02:24:12,737
"Will you come closer, oh Bella"

2591
02:24:12,779 --> 02:24:14,612
"Graceful as a deer, sweet Stella"

2592
02:24:14,696 --> 02:24:16,445
"Like a blooming rose"

2593
02:24:17,988 --> 02:24:20,487
"Come near me, my dear Laila"

2594
02:24:20,529 --> 02:24:22,320
"You're the endless Nile"

2595
02:24:22,362 --> 02:24:24,029
"I watch you, forever flowing"

2596
02:24:25,112 --> 02:24:26,862
"Life is low, low, low"

2597
02:24:26,904 --> 02:24:28,862
"Something slow, slow, slow"

2598
02:24:28,946 --> 02:24:30,779
"Do you know, know, know"

2599
02:24:30,862 --> 02:24:32,737
"Melting snow, snow"

2600
02:24:32,821 --> 02:24:34,696
"Life is low, low, low"

2601
02:24:34,737 --> 02:24:36,529
"Something slow, slow, slow"

2602
02:24:36,570 --> 02:24:38,445
"Do you know, know, know"

2603
02:24:38,487 --> 02:24:40,487
"Melting snow, snow"

2604
02:24:40,529 --> 02:24:42,404
"Delhi, Bombay, Kalpetta"

2605
02:24:42,445 --> 02:24:44,153
"On the road to Madurai we wander"

2606
02:24:44,195 --> 02:24:46,195
"As I travel these miles"

2607
02:24:46,237 --> 02:24:47,988
"I feel so distant, almost like I'm dead"

2608
02:24:48,029 --> 02:24:49,862
"Delhi, Bombay, Kalpetta"

2609
02:24:49,904 --> 02:24:51,779
"On the road to Madurai we wander"

2610
02:24:51,821 --> 02:24:53,696
"As I travel these miles"

2611
02:24:53,737 --> 02:24:55,612
"I feel so distant, almost like I'm dead"

2612
02:24:56,279 --> 02:24:58,279
"You conquered my heart and held me tight"

2613
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:00,320
"You stood by me like my heartbeat"

2614
02:25:00,362 --> 02:25:01,988
"Like a roaring beam of thunder"

2615
02:25:02,112 --> 02:25:03,821
"You crashed into my soul"

2616
02:25:03,862 --> 02:25:05,904
"Like a roaring beam of thunder"

2617
02:25:05,946 --> 02:25:07,946
"You stood by me like my heartbeat"

2618
02:25:07,988 --> 02:25:09,654
"Like a roaring beam of thunder"

2619
02:25:09,696 --> 02:25:11,445
"You crashed into my soul"

2620
02:25:26,612 --> 02:25:28,404
"Hey, intoxicating girl"

2621
02:25:28,529 --> 02:25:30,404
"Smiling so bright, like milk"

2622
02:25:30,445 --> 02:25:32,445
"Shining from afar"

2623
02:25:32,529 --> 02:25:34,279
"Oh girl, oh girl"

2624
02:25:34,362 --> 02:25:36,237
"With mascara's whisper,
You stole my glance"

2625
02:25:36,404 --> 02:25:38,112
"Took me soaring beyond this world,"

2626
02:25:38,153 --> 02:25:39,904
"To a far- off, foreign land"

2627
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:41,729
"Oh girl, oh girl"

2628
02:25:41,754 --> 02:25:43,587
"Life is low, low, low"

2629
02:25:43,612 --> 02:25:45,570
"Something slow, slow, slow"

2630
02:25:45,612 --> 02:25:47,362
"Do you know, know, know"

2631
02:25:47,387 --> 02:25:49,404
"Melting snow, snow"

2632
02:25:49,445 --> 02:25:51,070
"Life is low, low, low"

2633
02:25:51,112 --> 02:25:53,237
"Something slow, slow, slow"

2634
02:25:53,279 --> 02:25:54,988
"Do you know, know, know"

2635
02:25:55,029 --> 02:25:56,904
"Melting snow, snow"

2636
02:25:56,946 --> 02:25:58,946
"Delhi, Bombay, Kalpetta"

2637
02:25:58,988 --> 02:26:00,821
"On the road to Madurai we wander"

2638
02:26:00,862 --> 02:26:02,612
"As I travel these miles"

2639
02:26:02,637 --> 02:26:04,529
"I feel so distant, almost like I'm dead"

2640
02:26:04,554 --> 02:26:06,596
"Delhi, Bombay, Kalpetta"

2641
02:26:06,621 --> 02:26:08,496
"On the road to Madurai we wander"

2642
02:26:08,521 --> 02:26:10,343
"As I travel these miles"

2643
02:26:10,368 --> 02:26:12,827
"I feel so distant, almost
like I'm dead"
