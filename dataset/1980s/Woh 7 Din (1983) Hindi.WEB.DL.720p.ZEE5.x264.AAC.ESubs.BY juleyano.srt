SANSKRIT CHANTS

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.280
Look at the girl's fate! This
ramshackle house and this car!

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.000
Maya has found a wealthy groom!

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.720
They didn't even
have to give dowry!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.960
Neither a music band,
nor any relatives.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.000
As if it's not a
marriage but a robbery!

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.120
I think something is fishy.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.280
There must a flaw in either the
groom's family or the bride's.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.800
Mr. Anand, you've to
perform a ritual,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.440
..before tying the
nuptial thread.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.840
I'll utter the oaths.
Repeat after me.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.640
I... - I...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.280
This moment onwards...
- This moment onwards...

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.680
Take responsibility
of your livelihood.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800
Take responsibility
of your livelihood.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.640
To fulfil all your wishes and
to always keep you happy.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
To fulfil all your wishes and
to always keep you happy.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.600
I promise you. - I promise you.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.720
Accepting you as my wife,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.320
Accepting you as my wife,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.160
I want to give you
this nuptial thread.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.000
I want to give you
this nuptial thread.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.920
You say now.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.400
I... - I....

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.520
I'll be with you through all
the ups and downs in life.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.800
I'll be with you through all
the ups and downs in life.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.320
Following the religious path
laid down by the scriptures,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.480
Following the religious path
laid down by the scriptures,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.240
I won't tolerate any
unrighteousness.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.520
I won't tolerate any
unrighteousness.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.560
I accept the nuptial thread,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.680
I accept the nuptial thread,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.640
..considering the sacred
fire as the witness,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.680
..considering the sacred
fire as the witness,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.840
..considering God
to be the witness,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.600
..considering God
to be the witness,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.800
..all the celestial
bodies as the witness,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.600
..all the celestial
bodies as the witness,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.800
..saints and sages
as the witness,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.080
..saints and sages
as the witness,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.240
I promise you...
- I promise you,

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.680
..that I'll hold this nuptial
thread dearer than my life.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.240
I'll hold this nuptial
thread dearer than my life.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.000
Now put the nuptial
thread around her neck.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.280
These 7 rounds around the altar
binds you both together,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.000
..as life partners for
7 lifetimes to come.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.600
Dad!

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.600
You are so bad, dad!
You got married alone!

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.600
Why didn't you take me along?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.520
I've brought your mom.
She'll always be with you.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.200
Greet her, dear. - Greetings!

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.240
Savitri!

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.360
Look! Anand has come!

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.120
He has brought lady luck home!

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.400
Come here!

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.080
May God bless you!

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.240
May you lead a good life!

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.600
Listen!

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.000
Anand's room... - It's ready.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.720
Get up. Go and take rest!

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.240
What happened?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.480
Ganesh! - Yes sir!

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.360
Open the dispensary! - Yes, sir!

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.120
Ganesh! - Yes sir!

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.480
What happened?
- I don't know, sir!

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.400
What happened to
daughter-in-law?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:16.640
Nothing.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.520
Son! - You stay here!

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.920
Ganesh, close the door! - Okay!

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.600
What happened to
daughter-in-law?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.160
Is there anything to fear?
Will you say something?

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.680
Nothing serious!

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.480
She fainted due to fatigue
and will be fine by morning.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.200
Don't mention it to mother!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.720
She'll worry for no reason.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.080
Both of you can go to sleep now.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.720
No need to mention
it to anybody!

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.080
How are you feeling now?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.240
Forget that we got
married tonight.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.680
Consider me as your friend and
tell me what the problem is.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.960
Look, I'm a doctor.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.920
I've told everybody that you
fainted due to fatigue.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.400
Nobody knows that you
consumed poison.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.920
If a girl consumes poison
on the wedding night,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.720
..then it's obvious that she got
married against her wishes.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.720
Look, Maya! We have our
entire lives ahead of us!

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.920
Life will be difficult if we
keep each other in the dark.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.680
Don't cry. Tell me
what the matter is.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.520
Have you heard that joke?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.600
A man came beneath a car
with an intention to die.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.520
But he didn't die because
it was an ambulance.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.800
They took him to the
hospital and he was saved.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.720
You consumed poison in the
presence of a doctor?

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.720
It means God doesn't
want you to die now.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.320
You're destined to live
a long and happy life.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600
What's the matter?

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.480
Whatever you tell you. I'll
listen to you patiently.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.160
Tell me!

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.360
Tell me!

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.160
"Between us!"

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.120
"What a strange bond
is this between us?"

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.920
What is strange, boss?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.600
You are from Patiala and
even I'm from Patiala.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.640
This is our bond. What else?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.400
Hadn't I met you, I would've been
running a gambling den in Koliwada.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.800
Laxmikant-Pyarelal have composed
such nice tunes! Great!

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.920
Many have tried their hand,
but none could match them.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.080
Enough! Music won't
fill my appetite.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.200
I want food! Food!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.480
Immediately!

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.000
Since yesterday we've been living
off a loaf of bread and tea.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.600
I can't take it anymore.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.240
Fool! Let's find a house first.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:37.600
Then I'll cook for you myself.
Hot cornbread and spinach!

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.280
Oh my God! When will
you find a house?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.480
When will you cook and when
will I eat? - What to do?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:51.200
Nobody is willing to let out
their house to a bachelor.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.400
Then say that you're married!
This is Mumbai!

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.200
You can't survive
without lies here!

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.600
I'll give you a tight slap!

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.000
We'll begin a new life with a lie!?
No way!

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.760
I'll die! But I won't lie!

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.480
Then we both will die! Finished!

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.800
Heard that? The conch is blowing!
We spoke the truth!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You're so foolish!
It's not a conch!

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.000
It's a factory bell!
- It's all the same!

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.720
We are searching for work and
this is the factory's bell.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.640
Meaning a worker's conch!
Got it? Let's go!

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.000
Didn't I say our work
will be done today? Look!

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.000
There's no bell! What to ring?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.400
Why do you need a bell? Are we
pleaders? Knock on the door.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.120
Shout as well!

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.400
Why don't you call out
with your sweet voice?

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.360
Ma'am!

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.120
Ma'am! Ma'am...

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.920
Greetings! We've
come from Patiala!

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.280
Wait! I'm coming!
- But you are leaving!

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.480
We saw a girl's face.
It's a good sign.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.320
But she went away.
- She will come back.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.480
Don't you have any vessel?

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.600
What is the need for that? My
hand and mouth are sufficient.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.800
Its okay! He's young!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.960
You both sit here and eat in this!
- No! You are mistaken!

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.600
We've come to enquire
about the house on rent.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.240
You've humiliated me. I have some
honour, tradition and values.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.760
You tarnished everything!
- What? You didn't even let me lick i

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.080
We won't stay here. Let's go.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.000
Listen! Grandpa has
called you in.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.080
I told you!

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.080
The second sign is also auspicious.
Let's go.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.000
The drawstring. - What?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.000
The drawstring!

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.200
Greetings!

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.480
Maya! - Yes, grandpa!

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.360
I think you're right, Maya.
They look like them.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.760
Like who? - You're hanging
this box around your neck.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.240
So it looks as if
you're begging.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.280
I won't answer back since
you're elder to me.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.000
Even I have honour,
tradition and values.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.800
Talk to me respectfully.
- What do you want?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.920
Respect or room? - I'm already
respected. I need a room.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.320
Look, I'm giving only
one room on rent.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:32.320
This box won't even help
you to feed yourself.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.720
How will you pay the rent?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.840
Grandpa, I don't beg. I've come
here to be a music director.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.440
Have you ever seen the
big music directors,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.000
..playing music on the streets?

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.440
Is he your son?

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.080
No! - Yes!

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.000
What's this? One is saying no.
The other is saying yes.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.920
What is this?
- Actually we desperately need a room.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.920
Nobody is willing to give me a
room because I'm a bachelor.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.480
And...
- Bachelors first take a room on rent.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.280
Then they escape with,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.840
..the landlord's daughter
and the rent as well!

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.760
Many even run away
with the wives.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.960
Do you think I'm such a man?
- You don't look like one.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.280
I'm telling you all this because
women live in this house.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.520
No such behaviour will
be tolerated here.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.120
Not at all! The
question doesn't arise.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.600
Then listen. You won't enter the
house after 10 o'clock at night.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.120
Then where will I go?
- You will come before 10 o'clock.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.840
You won't cook in the room.
- Will we have our meals with you?

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.000
Shut up! You can have your meals
anywhere but not in the room.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.760
60 Rupees is the rent and the
deposit is 300. -300 rupees?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.200
We're leaving, grandpa.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.760
Fine! I want to see the room.
- I want the advance first.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.840
Where is the bathroom? - There.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.800
Hey, you! Where is he going?
- To bring the advance.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.200
Advance? In the bathroom?
- Yes! My boss is very smart!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.120
His mother told him to beware
of the thieves in Mumbai.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.600
So he doesn't keep the
money in his pocket.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.840
He keeps it underneath.
- Meaning?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.480
Here. In his underwear. How
will the thief steal it now?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.840
Please take this. - Drawstring.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.520
What? - Drawstring!

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.760
Keep it here!

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.000
Who knows what kind
of business he does!

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.560
Can I see the room now? - There!

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.640
How will we go up? By flying?
- Hey, fool! Don't fly!

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.720
Maya! - Yes!

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.720
How is it? - Good. Will do.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.920
What? - This stairs.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.640
Patiala guy! Talk to me clearly!

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.600
Else I will not spare you!
Got it?

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.400
Show them the room and
come down quickly!

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.600
Look how she's opening the door.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.920
Here's the room. Buy a new lock.
- No. Give me this key.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.520
I too will practice with this.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.560
Get another lock. You will get
the key. - Give this to me!

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.720
The boss won't go to the
toilet again for 5 bucks.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:24.280
I will teach you a lesson!
You've humiliated me once again!

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.360
Come!

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.800
Boss, the luggage is outside!
No!

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.720
Boss, it's better if you
shorten this drawstring.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.120
If grandpa sees it
again, he'll pull it.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.720
Don't taunt me early in the morning!
I warn you!

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.120
Chotu!
- What happened, boss? Who bit you?

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.080
Chotu, there is a hole.
But no latch!

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.960
Boss, hold it from inside with
the drawstring. - Shut up!

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.600
Guard the door.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.720
You know that I
bathe in the nude.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.600
How do I know? When did
you take a bath with me?

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.400
Don't talk too much!
Just do as I say!

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.720
Remain seated!
- What if I stand?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.800
Don't let anybody in
under any circumstance.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.800
I'll be in trouble
if anybody comes in.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Naked?

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.080
Boss, its better if I
inform everybody that

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.720
..there's no latch
in the bathroom,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.240
..and the boss is bathing naked.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.160
Don't be a fool! Remain seated!

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.760
And don't move! If
you dare to move...

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720
Chotu!

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.720
Boss! No! I won't do it! Sorry!
Boss! Forgive me!

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.000
The guy is one in a million!

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.200
He has his own house. 3 bedroom
and a hall. Attached bathroom!

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.000
As far as good deeds
are concerned,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.920
..not just his father, but even his
ancestors were social reformers.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.480
His age is around
25 to 26 years.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.160
The dowry is only
25,000-30,000 rupees.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.160
They're demanding a dowry
despite being social reformers?

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.000
Being social reformers won't change
the outlook of the scoundrels.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.560
I'm against dowry!

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.000
This is what I'm saying!
She is a girl,

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.000
You would've demanded a dowry
if you had a grandson.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.600
What did you say, Gangu?

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.200
She is such a virtuous girl!

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.960
She's my eldest granddaughter, Maya.
I was talking about her.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.360
God bless you!

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.520
She is the other granddaughter.
- God bless you!

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.800
She is my daughter!
- God bless you!

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.000
Gangu, you are blessing everybody
as if you'll even get me married.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.720
That's what I'm trying to tell you!
Why not?

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.640
Dye your hair! Shave
off your moustache!

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.920
Remove your spectacles.
You'll look like a hero.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.120
Shut up! Come!

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:58.160
Age is 49 but not yet 50.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.720
Right eye is working fine.
All his 32 teeth are intact.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.960
That too golden!
Maya will be rich!

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:15.640
Are you mocking me?
- Sir, I'm not mocking you.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.240
You are mocking yourself.
Look at your state!

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:28.000
Your son-in-law left your
daughter and children,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.360
..at your house and went away.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.760
This house is mortgaged.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.960
How much money do you earn?
Not much.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.840
You can't afford to give dowry
but you want a nice groom.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.920
Lower your expectations
and then talk.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.640
I'll lessen the amount if you
compromise with the situation.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.400
Are you Ganga Prasad?
- Why? Any objections?

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.200
No. The postman was asking. I
think it was your money order.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.400
My money order?

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.520
I told him there's no
Ganga Prasad here.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.400
Where did the postman go? - He must
be at the corner of the street.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.800
Oh my God! Postman! - Listen!

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:08.960
Your album!
- You have put me in trouble! Postman!

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.720
What is this, Maya?

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.920
I neither like this man nor
the alliances that he brings.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.480
Sheela has not even
completed her education.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.560
She has to learn typing
and shorthand as well.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:26.320
How can I marry until she gets
a job and Prakash is cured?

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.120
Don't worry about these never
ending household problems.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.200
I said what I had to say!
I won't marry now!

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.720
"What are you doing
in my courtyard?"

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.240
"What are you doing
in my courtyard?"

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:53.080
"What are you doing
in my courtyard?"

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.680
"What are you doing
in my courtyard?"

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.720
Chotu! Quickly get limestone!

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.200
Can I get some limestone?
To apply on boss's thumb.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.200
Apply some ointment!
Limestone won't heal it.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.160
I don't know that but the boss will
only apply limestone as it's free.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.640
Fire is free too.
Shall I give that?

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.480
I've seen many misers!
But none like your boss.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.600
Ma'am, you don't know the boss.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.400
He doesn't talk about his problems.
But I'll tell you.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.120
The boss' family is in Punjab.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.600
He has an old mother
and young siblings.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.800
She works as a
maid to feed them.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.920
But boss has to bear other expenses.
Do you know what he did?

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:45.520
He donated blood a few days
ago and sent the money home.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.600
Chotu! Knock the door.
- You do it.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.080
Chotu! Look my thumb...

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.240
What happened? - We have come!

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.160
So what should I do?
- Move aside and let us go in.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.480
Grandpa had asked you to
be back home by 10pm.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.120
My watch is not working.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.360
So I didn't know the time and
I forgot that grandpa...

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.360
You won't forget it if you
sleep outside for a night.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.720
We're sorry! It
won't happen again.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.680
Good! You go in!

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.720
Apologise and I'll let you in.
- Fine. I apologise.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.080
It won't happen again. Sorry!

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.760
Don't say it with a sullen face.
- Sorry!

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.600
The first one was better.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.760
I need a needle and thread
to stitch boss' pants.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.360
I'll stitch it.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.040
How is your boss's thumb?
- Not good!

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.800
The thumb has swollen badly.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:15.960
Move!

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.960
Take this! Tell him to apply it.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Else he might have to amputate it
in his bid to save a few pennies.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.400
Miser! The milk's getting burnt!

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:29.480
Boss!

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.520
Did you get the needle and the thread?
- I got it stitched, boss.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.320
Great!

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.320
Who gave you this?
- This? That...

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.240
What joke is this! I don't like it!
Let me tell you!

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.040
Where are all the family members?
Why don't you come out?

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.680
What happened? Why
are you shouting?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.400
Look at her shamelessness! She
dares to ask what happened!

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.640
Why did you send
your stuff to me?

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.400
You are a strange man!
It's for your own good!

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.240
You will feel better
after using it!

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.200
Will I use this? Am I a
woman that I'll use this?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.120
What happened? Why
is he yelling?

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.080
Do you expect me to be quiet?

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.920
Prem Pratap from Patiala
won't tolerate this!

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.280
Beware if you uttered a single word!
I'll burn this ladder!

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.080
You'll hang there like a
monkey all your life.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.720
Hey you! Why are you getting angry?
What happened?

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.720
What happened? Why
is he yelling?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320
He was saying,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.960
..that he was a high and low jump
champion in school. – Really!

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.400
So he's going to jump. - Great!

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.200
Will you jump from this height?
Jump!

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.040
Yes! Jump! Please jump!

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.520
You! - Boss, let it be!

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.600
I think he's mad!

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.160
"Call me lovingly!"

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:12.520
Wow!

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:15.920
Chotu!

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.760
Hey! What are you doing here?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.200
I'm returning from office. But
why are you wetting that cloth?

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.080
This? This is my boss's lunch.
Midday meal.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.080
Midday meal? - Yes.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.480
Different types of hunger
in the world have,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.080
..different ways
of satiating it.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.520
My boss knows all these
tricks very well.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.840
When you're hungry and you
don't have anything to eat,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.480
..the only solution
is to wet a cloth,

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.640
..and tie it tightly
around the stomach.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.760
Your hunger vanishes
in 3 minutes.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.320
This is the boss'
lunch thrice a week.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.200
Then why is he in Mumbai?

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.720
Tell him to return to his
village and do farming.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:13.200
Tell me something, Chotu.
Does he know music?

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.320
What does that girl think?
She's no match to me!

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.600
I am Prem Pratap from Patiala!
My family...

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.800
Now what to say, boss?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.640
I told her that my boss is
not less than any Beethoven.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.240
Beethoven is nothing. I'm no
less than his father too!

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:35.360
I'll mesmerise her with my music.
Pick up that drum!

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.800
1, 2, 3, 4!

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.400
"Don't fall in love with me,"

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.000
"Don't fall in love with me,"

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.280
"if the heart starts
beating, what will happen?"

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.360
"if the heart starts
beating, what will happen?"

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.920
"There's a delicate
veil in between,"

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.680
"There's a delicate
veil in between,"

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.320
"There's a delicate
veil in between,"

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.080
"what will happen if it slips?"

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.000
"what will happen if it slips?"

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.520
"Don't fall in love with me,"

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.680
"Don't fall in love with me,"

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:12.200
"The heart is a sinner,."

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.400
"the body is wounded!"

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.240
"The anklet is tinkling!"

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.920
"The heart is a sinner,."

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.920
"the body is wounded!"

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.680
"The anklet is tinkling!"

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.800
"If any bell of your anklet...."

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:39.480
"What will happen if the bells
of your anklet tinkle?"

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.320
"What will happen
if it tinkles?"

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.720
"Don't fall in love with me,"

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.880
"Don't fall in love with me."

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:26.480
"I'm afraid of your
kohl and the clouds,"

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.920
"I'm afraid of your
kohl and the clouds,"

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.800
"the thunder in the clouds...."

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:47.280
"What'll happen if the thunder
in the clouds struck?"

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:51.080
"What will happen
if it strikes?"

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.320
"Don't fall in love with me."

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.520
"Don't fall in love with me."

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.040
"Don't tease me,"

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.800
"my desires might get aroused!"

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.400
"Don't tease me,"

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.200
"my desires might get aroused!"

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.000
"My heart is a glass,
it's brittle,"

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.640
"My heart is a glass,
it's brittle,"

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.760
"what'll happen if it shatters?"

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.200
"Don't fall in love with me!"

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.320
"Don't fall in love with me!"

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:16.480
What happened?

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.480
Take this. Give this to your boss.
- What is this?

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:22.800
Snacks. The sauce
is packed inside.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:31.200
It smells nice! How many? 100 or 200?
- Shut up!

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.520
Give it to your boss. Ask him
whether he liked it or not.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.960
No, ma'am! If boss loses his temper
he'll throw the snacks on my face.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.560
Nothing will happen. Tell him that
I've made it especially for him.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.440
What are you saying, ma'am?
You don't know.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.560
Boss will starve. But he won't beg
to anybody. - You are a fool!

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.320
It's right that you shouldn't
take anything from others.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.520
But what's the harm
taking it from one's kin?

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.920
Kin? What do you mean?

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.200
I mean to say that
I'm not a stranger.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.600
Look, isn't boss like your
elder brother? - Yes.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.000
So that makes me your sister-in-law.
- What?

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.160
What are you? My sister-in-law?

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.680
So what will be your
relation with the boss?

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.240
I mean to say...

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.400
I see! So this is the issue!

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.200
I'll tell him! Sister-in-law!

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.800
Snacks?
- Rice cakes weren't available.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.200
I gave you the money
for just 2 rice cakes.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.080
Where did you get so
many snacks from?

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:49.280
I didn't bring it from the hotel boss.
Sister-in-law gave this.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.080
Sister-in-law? Who?

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.320
The girl downstairs!

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.400
No, boss! I didn't accept it
willingly! she didn't listen.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.760
She said boss won't
say anything.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.080
What is this? - Snacks!

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.800
I don't like it!
Let me tell you!

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.680
If you don't like it then throw this on
that fool's face who gave it to you.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.600
That's what I'm doing! Your dear
granddaughter has sent these!

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.200
Ask her!

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.240
Maya!

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.280
Grandpa, what happened is that
the small boy came to me...

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.840
Not in Marathi! - Shut up!

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.120
How did the snacks go up?

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.600
Look, grandpa! Don't
abuse me in Marathi!

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.720
If I start abusing in Punjabi,

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.520
..you won't be able to
understand anything!

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
What nonsense is this! You came to
give me alms as if I'm a beggar!

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.760
I forgave her
thinking she's a kid!

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.920
Today again you sent it!
This is the limit!

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.960
I live in your house and pay the rent.
I don't live here for free.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.800
I admit that I'm poor.
I don't have money.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.320
But I toil! I don't come to
you for alms! - Listen to me!

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.000
I'm telling you and her
for the last time!

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.000
Prem Pratap from Patiala has some
honour, tradition and values.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.120
If you do it again, I won't
tolerate it. Beware!

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.120
So you had given him snacks!

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.960
No, grandpa. Chotu
was very hungry.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.080
I took pity on him
and gave him some.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.000
Maybe he gave it to his boss too.
This fool got infuriated.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.480
Look at this! We're giving
him food with love,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.760
..and he's abusing us!
That too in Punjabi!

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.640
I see! He doesn't
have a single penny,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.080
..but talks like the king of Patiala.
I'll teach him a lesson!

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.560
You! - Let it be, grandpa!

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.000
Shut up! I won't spare him!

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.520
Let it be, grandpa. He's mad!
He doesn't understand anything.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.000
You'll tell him
something in Marathi.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.880
He won't be able to understand
anything. Sit down!

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.560
Have your breakfast.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.920
He will pay for this.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.600
Did you see? The fruits of your
honour, tradition and values.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.320
This banana! If you had
listened to that producer,

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.000
..we would've had good
food and ice-cream to eat.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.680
But what did you do?
You refused!

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.800
If he wanted a film song, then
you should've given it to him.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.040
Why do you act so smugly?

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.720
Why will I sell
somebody else's music?

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.960
Boss, we all are in
the same profession.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.480
Give and take goes
on in business.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.840
Just think. You ask for
sweets from a vendor.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.000
He gives you snacks instead.
Will you take it? - Why will I?

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.920
Don't I know the difference
between sweets and savoury?

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.640
Won't I throw the savoury on
that shopkeeper's face? - Yes!

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.040
Similarly the producer threw
the offer on your face.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.800
Look, Chotu! I can't
imitate anybody!

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.080
We can't starve all
our life either!

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.840
Let it be! Knock the door!

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.840
No, boss. You shouldn't wake
up the sleeping serpent.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.080
She'll bite you. Listen to
me and sleep here only.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:13.080
Am I scared? I pay the rent.
I'll daringly knock on the door.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.360
Praise the almighty!

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.400
Chotu went in!
- Let him! You talk to me.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.120
Are you nuts?

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.520
Don't you even understand,

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:32.480
..why a girl secretly
sends snacks to a guy?

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.560
I can't make music secretly. How
can I eat snacks sent secretly?

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.400
Lower your voice.
You'll wake up grandpa.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.680
I'm not scared of your grandpa. As
if he is not grandpa but a lion.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.800
Call your grandpa! Call him!
Call everybody! What is this?

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.400
At times you send snacks,
at times something else.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.480
Don't lock horns with
Prem Pratap from Patiala!

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.840
I have honour,
tradition and values!

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:13.800
Wow! What a scene! What form!
I'm blessed!

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:36.200
CHANTS

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.160
Wow! Beautiful!

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.960
Lovely! Beautiful!

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.200
Look this is 'Danashvi' raga.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.760
You shouldn't use 'Shuddevat'
in this Use 'Kovatdevat'.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.480
If you will use 'Shuddevat',
it will change the raga.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.920
Stop that!

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.080
Stop that noise, I'm trying
to teach music here.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:53.000
"The anklet is tinkling!"

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.920
Stupid! Fool! Idiot!

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.720
"The anklet is tinkling!"

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.720
Don't be angry! Use 'Shuddevat'!
It's okay!

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.080
"Fool!"

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.480
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.920
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.720
"If the tracks are damaged...."

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.480
"If the tracks are damaged,
the train will be derailed!"

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:57.520
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.080
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.000
"People who don't have a heart,"

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.720
"People who don't have a heart,"

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.800
"Why should I meet such people?"

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.280
"Such people..."

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.120
"Why should I meet such people?"

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.520
"If you meet such people...."

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:56.240
"If you meet such people,
the meeting is ruined!"

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:03.600
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:34.000
"If the light and
the wick stay away,

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.800
"how will there be light?"

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:42.520
"There will be darkness
the whole night,"

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.520
"There will be darkness
the whole night,"

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:48.960
"the oil will be wasted!"

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:56.520
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.200
"The bird is eager to fly,"

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.560
"how to open the cage?"

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.960
"The bird is eager to fly,"

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.480
"how to open the cage?"

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.240
"If the prisoner ran away,"

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.320
"If the prisoner ran away,
what'll be the use of the cage?"

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.720
"Fool!"

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.560
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.800
"When a fool plays a
game, he ruins it!"

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.960
Idiot! - You are right!

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.560
I've been observing your
attempts for a long time.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.400
Had a girl been
after me like this,

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.000
I would've already
roamed around with her,

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.720
..and took her to a
nice restaurant.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.400
Shown her a movie and
settled the matter.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.920
Aren't you ashamed to talk
like this at this age!

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.800
Aren't you ashamed to talk about
this to an innocent child?

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.120
What can I do? I can only
tell you my problems.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.600
Do one thing, Chotu! Convey
my feelings to your boss!

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.320
I'll do that. What's the big deal?
I'll quickly tell boss.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:48.480
Boss too will come down quickly
and tell your grandpa.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.480
Will that be fine with you?
- No.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.560
That fool is unpredictable! He'll
surely do something like that.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.520
Then grandpa will thrash him.
What's the use?

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.000
What is this? Can't you
talk from a distance?

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.200
I won't bite you! Why are
you so scared of me?

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.520
Scared? Why will I
be scared of you?

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.240
I've already paid the
rent to your grandpa.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.520
I haven't come to
ask for the rent.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.200
Will you be able to
compose the music,

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.800
..if someone gives
you the lyrics?

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.640
Again the same thing!
Do you see this, Chotu?

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.640
This Marathi girl is again challenging
Prem Pratap from Patiala!

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.760
Boss, you're always
eager to fight.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.200
You should first ask
which song it is.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.120
Tell me. Which is the...

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.200
Is this a song or a horoscope?

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.600
Won't you read what's written?

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:08.600
I don't want to read it. You read it.
I'll understand.

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:15.600
Look, I want you to hear it properly.
Understand it properly.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.400
Engrave it in your
heart and your mind.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Let it course through your veins.
Let it be a part of your blood.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.600
Chotu! Look what she's saying.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:32.840
Boss, she's telling you to
understand it properly.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.880
Once you understand the meaning,
everything else will be fine.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.280
Fine! Read it out!

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.920
This is a love song. We
both love each other a lot.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.800
I understood!

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.480
Really? - Yes!

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:57.480
A girl and a boy are
best of friends.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.200
Not a girl and a boy!
You and me!

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.800
Fine! What's the situation?

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:12.840
It's midnight. Everybody at
home is in deep slumber.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.080
Only I can't sleep.
Because I love you a lot.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.720
I can't live without
you even for a moment.

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.840
So I quietly get up and come
to meet you on the roof.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.120
You are here all alone.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.400
It's a moonlit night. There
is silence all around.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:42.080
I run to you and embrace you. You
hug me tightly in your arms.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.000
Warm breaths, fast
beating hearts,

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.600
Smouldering bodies,
souls in pain!

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:58.560
Actors like Amitabh and Rekha
will be apt for this song.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.720
Why did they come in between
you and me! You ***!

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:06.400
Just watch! Their
acting and my music!

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.000
The song will be a super hit!

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.200
Even the children will sing it!
Chotu, pick up the drum!

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.240
Read it.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.240
I can't live without you.
You can't live without me.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.920
Love can't exist without us.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.200
Without love, we can't exist.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.080
What? Repeat it. Let me
understand the meaning.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.800
Boss, the meaning is that you and
Maya are made for each other.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:43.600
Made for each other! - I see!

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.000
Meaning without me,
even you can't live!

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.560
Now you've understood it boss!
Just look there.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.200
Fine! Start the beat!

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:15.920
"I can't live without you,
you can't live without me!"

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:22.000
"I can't live without you,
you can't live without me!"

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:27.200
"Love can't exist without us,
without love, we can't exist!"

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:35.120
"I can't live without you,
you can't live without me!"

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.600
Liked the tune?

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:41.720
Nice.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.840
Chotu, I have a doubt.

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.720
When you, me or
love doesn't exist,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.200
..who's singing this song?
Why is he singing and where?

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:59.720
What do I care? Continue!

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:05.400
Boss, you are a fool! Stupid!

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.800
Are these the words?

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:12.280
No, the actual words
are I'm a fool.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:17.640
I'm stupid, idiot.
Sing it like this.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.160
Let's start. 1-2-3-4!

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:29.280
"I'm a fool, stupid an idiot!"

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.080
"I am a fool!"

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.320
"I am a fool!"

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.720
"I am a fool!"

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.600
"I am a fool!"

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.920
"I am a fool!"

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.800
"I am a fool!"

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:53.920
Prem Pratap!

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.480
Prem Pratap!

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.000
Prem Pratap from Patiala!

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.640
Why are you screaming?

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:02.280
Will you hear it if I
say call out softly?

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.960
Here's your money order receipt.

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:07.920
Money order? I didn't send any money.
What is this receipt for?

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.920
Is your name Prem Pratap? - Yes!

00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.160
Do you recognise the
signature of the receiver?

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:16.840
This is my mother's signature.

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.800
Chotu! I didn't send
money to mother.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.080
Then how come this receipt?

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.200
Boss, what do I know
who sent the money?

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.000
Where are the bangles? Why
don't you say anything?

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.200
I gave my necklace and
made bangles for you.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.600
So that it'll prove
useful in your marriage.

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.240
But you don't even bother to
tell me where you lost it!

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.720
Why are you yelling? Had I known,
I would've brought it myself.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:47.800
I'll teach you a lesson! Where
are your bangles? Tell me!

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.680
Go and bring Maya's bangles.
- What bangles, boss?

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.600
Give it to Maya.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.480
Didn't you hear what I said?

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.720
I won't go! Go and give
it if you want to.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.200
Chotu! - Are you a man?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.400
You always talk about music!

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.600
But you can't understand
what's in a girl's heart.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.800
How can you become
a music director?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.800
Fine! Now go and return it!
- Return it!

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.960
Will returning the bangles
set everything right?

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.720
Will her wounds heal? Will
she be relieved of the pain?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:53.960
If you want to return, then
return her smile, her love.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.320
Have you ever thought why that
girl mortgaged her bangles?

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.400
For your sake!

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.400
Why did she send money to your mother?
For your sake!

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.160
Why did she quietly endure the
beatings? For your sake, boss!

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.920
Poor girl! She fell
in love with a fool.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.160
Shall I tell you
the truth, Chotu?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.800
Even I love Maya a lot.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.280
But I don't express my love.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.840
I can't tell it to anybody.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Because Maya's family
won't accept my love.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.800
I'm a poor man, unemployed too.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.800
There's only one option left.
To elope with Maya.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.800
Do you know the consequences
of that, Chotu?

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.920
Maya's humiliation. Her
family's humiliation.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.080
She has a younger sister, too.
Who will marry her?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.600
Maya is a nice girl. She's
beautiful and virtuous.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.920
If she gets married
in a rich family,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.400
..all the problems of this
family will be solved.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:03.080
I keep quiet because of all this.
- Forgive me, boss.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.120
That poor girl asserts her
love for me in different ways.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.800
But I feign ignorance.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.120
I even sing that I'm
a fool, stupid.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.880
What to do? I'm helpless.

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.320
And you...

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.120
I heard your helplessness
and your heart too.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.120
Your helplessness is
true like your heart.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.920
But even I'm helpless.
Hear it out.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.800
No girl should fall in
love before marriage.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.320
But I've committed that mistake.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.120
Now I can't love anyone else.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.360
If I marry someone else,

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.480
..my life will become miserable.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.880
"If I could keep
quiet, I would have,"

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.800
"but it's difficult
to keep quiet!"

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.920
"Read my eyes and understand
what lies in my heart,"

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.640
"it's difficult to express it!"

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.000
"I'm innocent, I don't know
the language of eyes!"

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.720
"Innocent!"

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.880
"Bangle!"

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.480
"Bangle!"

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.800
"Damsel, your bangles
stole my slumber,"

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.640
"Bangle!"

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.960
"Damsel, your bangles
stole my slumber,"

01:04:52.080 --> 01:05:01.120
"Beloved! Some day I'll come
to your house wearing this!"

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.200
"Beloved!"

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.400
"Forget this fervour,"

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:45.280
"talk to me comfortably!"

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:54.720
"Who told you to
love me so much?"

01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:01.680
"We can't control love!"

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.680
"Bangle!"

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.800
"Damsel, your bangles
stole my slumber,"

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.000
"Bangle!"

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:12.640
"If we can't unite in this
world, let's die together!"

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:21.600
"Flowers will blossom through
this earth, if we die together!"

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.720
"My heart is tormented,"

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.680
"I can't sleep the whole night!"

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:32.520
"Bangle!"

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:37.640
"Damsel, your bangles
stole my slumber,"

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:41.400
"Beloved!"

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.520
"Someday, I'll come to
your house wearing this!"

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.320
"Beloved!"

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.920
Datta, the guy looks
like a Prince!

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:19.800
He's a rich doctor. This
family will prosper.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.840
It's fine. But Gangu, it's
the guy's second marriage.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.320
So my heart doesn't agree.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.520
Let me see! His first wife
is not alive, father!

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:37.120
His age is also around 30.
- That's what even I'm saying.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.360
Only you can make Datta see
reason now. - Shut up!

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.640
Father, I think the guy is fine.
He's rich too.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.760
It'll be good for our children.
- That's what I'm saying.

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.160
The guy's mother is
on her death bed.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:59.080
She'll soon die. Maya is
going to rule after that.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.400
Then you go and fix the alliance.
- The guy's family is in a hurry.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.160
Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.600
The marriage can be conducted
tomorrow. If it's acceptable to you.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.720
How many times should
I say that its fine!

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.280
That's what even I'm saying. It's
great! Congratulations Datta!

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:24.240
Wow! The girl too has arrived.
It's a good sign for the marriage.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.520
God bless you!

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.000
What was he saying? What good sign?
Whose marriage?

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.480
Your marriage, dear. The
date is fixed for tomorrow.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:43.600
So suddenly? How can you fix
my marriage without asking me?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.200
We've confirmed it after taking
everything into consideration.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:49.320
Yes, Maya! We've thought
well and selected this guy!

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.320
No matter what your decision is!
I won't marry!

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.400
What did you say?

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.280
Have you gone mad? We've
fixed everything!

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.520
Your marriage is tomorrow.
- I don't want to marry!

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.680
Aren't you ashamed
to disgrace us?

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.800
We've given our word! If you refused,
our image will be tarnished!

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.040
Let me be! Listen to me!
I won't marry!

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.200
How can you refuse?
- Come inside! I'll make sure you do!

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:19.200
Come in! - Come!

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.000
Chotu! - Yes!

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.200
Go and see what Maya is doing.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I've checked 5 times
since evening.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.480
She's sitting on the window
sill like a prisoner.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.320
She's crying inconsolably.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.160
I'll wait at the corner of the street.
Quickly bring Maya.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.320
What's in this bag?

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.760
Some clothes, money that I've
saved and some jewellery.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
We are not eloping, Maya. We'll
get married in the temple.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.400
Then we'll take our
elders' blessing.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.880
Go and keep the luggage.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.560
No, Prem. You are naive.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.480
If you returned, grandpa will
behave very badly with you.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.800
It's okay. We're not
doing anything wrong.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.480
I don't fear anybody except God.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.600
But Prem...
- Go and keep the luggage.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.320
Look, Chotu. The shops
will open by 4:30.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:50.680
Buy two garlands and thread and
come directly to the temple.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.600
By then, the priest
too will wake up.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.080
Maya!

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.680
I know that every girl desires
her marriage to be conducted,

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.080
..with great pomp and show.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:18.640
She should wear the bridal attire.
Henna should adorn her hands.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.560
But you have to get married like this.
Secretly! Covertly!

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.840
But Maya, if everybody's
desires got fulfilled,

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.360
..then temples
wouldn't be built,

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.960
..and nobody would
come here to pray.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.960
No, Prem. I have no
complains with God.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:48.560
I have no complains with you, too.
I'm angry at myself.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.160
Because of me, your image
is being tarnished.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.280
A self-respecting man like you,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.000
..has to secretly accept an
unfortunate female like me.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.320
Instead of my family's blessings
you'll only get their curses.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.320
Maya, you shouldn't say that.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.080
Elders do get annoyed
with children.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.960
But they never curse them.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.800
Your family will forget
all this very soon.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.680
They'll shower their
blessing on us.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840
Prem. – Beat him!

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.200
You come with me.
- Don't beat him!

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.520
Want to do love marriage?

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.080
Don't beat him!
- Keep quiet! Come!

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.200
I’ll teach you a lesion.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.120
Please don't beat Prem! No!
Please don't beat Prem!

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.320
Take this medicine.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.400
Take this medicine
and try to sleep.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.120
You need rest.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:14.400
Please.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.800
Have it. It'll flush out
the remaining poison.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.320
But I don't want to live.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.400
I don't have the courage
to lead dual lives.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.400
Get some poison for me.
I want to die.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.680
Look, I told you that I'm a doctor.
It's my profession to fight death.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.280
It's very easy to poison
somebody to death.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.480
But it's difficult to
save somebody from death.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.880
Death can't solve any problem.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.840
I won't pressurise you.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.720
But I too have a problem.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.400
Hear it out. Then you can
do whatever you want.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.680
Shanta, my first wife, died
while giving birth to Chanda.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.320
Her photo is still in this room.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:18.680
This is proof enough
that I still love her.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:24.160
She died 6 years ago. But
I didn't marry again.

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.480
My mother was very
worried for me.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.640
Gradually this sorrow took a toll on
her health and she got bedridden.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:39.680
She had only one wish. She
wanted a daughter-in-law.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.720
So that the motherless
Chanda gets a mother.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.280
You've seen how ill mother is.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.640
As a son, I want my mother
to live a long life.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:03.400
But as a doctor, I know that she
won't live for more than a few days.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.080
I agreed to get married to
give some happiness to,

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.680
..my mother during
her last days.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.800
When mother applied
vermillion on your forehead,

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.320
I saw the joy on her face.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.960
I hadn't seen such happiness on
mother's face for the past 6 years.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.480
I know that I'll never
get to see it again.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.400
In order not to hurt my
mother during her last days,

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:47.680
I request you to live in this
house for a few days, as my wife.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.960
I promise you that
I'll find your Prem.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.800
I'll hand you over
to him respectfully.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.840
I don't want you to
stay here forcefully.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.800
If you live as my
wife for a few days,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.520
I'll forever remain
indebted to you.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.840
I hope you'll think
calmly about this,

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.840
..and reach the right
decision by morning.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.080
I'll take leave now. Goodnight!

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:46.720
Dad! Grandpa said that from today
my new mother will look after me!

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.400
Then why are you
giving me a bath?

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.120
Dear, this house is
new for your new mom.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.000
She doesn't even know
where the bathroom is,

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:59.160
..where the soap is, where
Chanda's clothes are.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.800
After she learns all this,
she'll look after you.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.480
Don't trouble your new mom.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:10.800
First find out whether she's
in a good mood. - But...

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.800
But why will her
mood be bad, dad?

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.480
I've brought her here away
from her home, her mother.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.880
So she must be missing them.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.320
I see! Then send new mom
back to her house, dad!

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:32.800
I'll send her, dear. In a week or
so, I'll send her back to her home.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.560
How are you feeling now?

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.680
You didn't take the tablets.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.920
Please don't be careless.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.920
You've to take it twice, in
the morning and evening.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.480
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll find out about him.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.680
He must be somewhere
in the city.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:08.000
We'll find him and all your
problems will be solved.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:09.800
I'm leaving.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.920
I have a small request.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.480
Mother must be eagerly waiting
for her daughter-in-law.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.360
If not as a daughter-in-law,
then for the sake of humanity,

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:36.520
..if you sit with my dying
mother for sometime,

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.800
I'll be indebted to you.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.480
What is this, son?

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:59.120
It hasn't been a day since your marriage,
and you're going to the hospital?

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.800
What will that poor girl think?

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.400
It's important to go, father. I
have to perform 2-3 operations.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.800
Why should the patients suffer
because of my marriage?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.320
Why to put their life in danger?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:21.400
Anand, you refused for 6 years.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:27.000
But you've finally married again
for the sake of your mother.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.000
Because I won't live for long.
Am I right?

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.000
Don't say that, mother.
You're getting better.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:40.800
In a week's time you'll
start walking, too.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:46.080
Talk to your mother like a
son, not like a doctor.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.800
Tell me. Did you like the girl?

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.200
She's good. She was
about to come down.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.160
She saw some books lying around.
So she started arranging them.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.600
She'll come to meet you
after taking a bath.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:09.000
Have you both gelled well? Have
you both liked each other?

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:11.520
Yes.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.400
Son, I know that you can
never forget Shanta.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.320
I don't say that you should
forget people after their death.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.600
But you should not
hurt those who're,

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.280
..alive by mourning
for the deceased.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.000
What have I done, mother?

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:46.680
Promise that you'll
always keep her happy.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.920
Promise me. - Yes, mother.

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.200
I'll do everything for
Maya's happiness.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.720
I promise you that I'll
fulfil all her wishes.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.200
I heard that day before, a
couple came here to get married.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.200
Yes. I'm asking about them.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.800
Can you tell me where that guy is?
- I told you. I don't know anything.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:11.000
Kishan! Was there a
fight here that night?

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.200
Sir, it was great! They bought
two garlands from my shop!

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.720
That guy was a Punjabi!

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:22.320
Look at his guts! He was flirting
with a girl from my locality!

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.240
People thrashed him
black and blue!

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.640
I quietly watched
from behind the door.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.800
Nowadays people shouldn't interfere
in all this. - Then what happened?

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.920
Sir, I fled. Who'd want to
get involved with the law?

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.520
Wait! I'll answer it! Go!

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.400
Hello! This is Chanda
Anand speaking!

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.000
Hello, Ms. Anand. This is Dr.
Anand speaking.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.320
Yes, doctor.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:54.560
Did mom have her breakfast?
- No!

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.520
No? Did she have her medicine?
- No!

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.320
Did she go down to meet grandma?
- No!

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.480
I see!

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.200
Listen, dear.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.600
Tell mom it's fine if she doesn't
want to go to meet grandma.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.720
But ask her to take her medicine.
Fine?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.840
Oh! I see!

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:49.240
Dad called up and said its okay if
you don't want to meet grandma.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.120
But have your breakfast and
do take your medicine.

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.640
That is most important.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.080
'Mother must be eagerly waiting
for her daughter-in-law.'

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.320
'If not as a daughter-in-law,
for the sake of humanity,'

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.120
'if you sit with my dying
mother for sometime,'

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.600
'I'll be indebted to you.'

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.600
Did you like this house, dear?

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.080
And my son?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.600
Did he talk to you?

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.120
His nature is a bit
different, dear.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:05.240
He doesn't talk too much.
Don't feel disappointed. Ok?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.480
The honour, respect, peace
and harmony of this house,

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:19.920
I'm handing over
everything to you, dear.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.480
The day I had come in this
house as a daughter-in-law,

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.760
..my mother-in-law had given
me this responsibility.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.480
I'm doing the same thing today.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:43.080
Though you're young,
but from today,

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.800
I'm giving you the responsibility
of three children.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.160
Father, son and granddaughter.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.800
You'll have to be the
mother of all three.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.200
Anand didn't marry for
6 years fearing that,

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.080
..maybe the step-mother won't
take good care of the child.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.600
But I judged you at first sight.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.200
That you are not
such kind of a girl.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.160
Promise me dear, that
you'll look after Chanda.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.480
I knew that you'll
be kind at heart.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:32.160
Your arrival will bring back
the happiness of this house.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.360
Mom, dad had called again!

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.320
He was asking whether
mom had her breakfast.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.520
I said mom hasn't even
touched her breakfast.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.960
So dad said, I see!

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:54.520
So Chanda, tell mother
to have her breakfast.

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.360
I can't eat so much!

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
The other plate is mine, mom.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.200
I thought if I eat,
you won't eat at all.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.800
So I too didn't eat.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.080
If I starved my whole life
will you do the same?

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:17.320
Yes! But mom, I'm famished!
- Is that so? Come!

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.120
You are very sweet, mom!

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.200
Now you eat, mom! - Okay.

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:25.800
Maya!

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.400
Chotu will wake up! - Boss, I won't
wake up. I'm in deep slumber.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:36.360
He's talking in his sleep.
- Yes. I'm talking in my sleep, boss.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:39.360
Leave! - C'mon!

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.640
What? What are you doing?
Leave my hand!

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.800
Otherwise I'll raise commotion!
- What commotion?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.080
My honour is at stake!
Won't I raise a commotion?

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.400
Then shout! Whom will you call?
Chotu?

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.400
Why have you come up alone
so late in the night?

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.000
Should I bring grandpa along?
Fool!

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:59.600
Fool? Have you come at midnight
to tell me that I'm a fool?

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:03.400
Then what! Guys plead so much!

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.360
They implore so much! Only then
does the girl agree to meet!

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:11.160
Does a girl come all
alone at night?

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.280
Then why have you come?

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:17.000
I've been mad enough to
fall in love with you.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.080
Had it been some other guy then...
- What would he do?

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.120
He would take advantage
of this opportunity.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.160
It's a cold moonlit night.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:37.400
We should hold each
others hands and romance.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.360
Talk romantically now!
- Oh my God!

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:50.600
Look, I've already
crossed my line.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.920
Now if we are caught, we'll
be thrashed black and blue.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.040
We won't be thrashed any
less if we sit apart.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.520
Sitting close won't help us escape
a good thrashing as well. Got it?

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.880
What should I do now?

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:10.800
Now you'll place your
head on my lap and rest.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:18.000
No! Not on your lap.
- Look! Just do what I say!

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.720
Otherwise I'll scream
and tell every one,

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:29.160
..that you called me here and
you're trying to rape me.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.840
No! - Now quietly lie down here!

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.000
This is my knee, not my lap!

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.000
Now turn your face!

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.760
What happened?

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.320
Maya, I'm telling you!
Go away otherwise...

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.000
Otherwise what?
- You'll catch cold!

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.000
You could catch cold if you stayed
out in the moonlit night for long!

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.200
Sit properly!

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.960
Tell me! - Kiss me!

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.640
What? - A kiss!

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.600
No, Maya! - Yes fool!

01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.720
Look, if you don't kiss me,
I'll stay here the whole night.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:32.920
Kiss me!

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:39.320
Where? - Kiss me here!

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:42.120
No. – Its fine. Do it here.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.520
Will you leave if I kiss you?

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:51.680
First kiss me, I'll think about it!
- Then I won't kiss you!

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.720
Fine! Give me a kiss!

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:54.920
Look at your face!

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:05.800
Are you loving me or drinking poison!
Smile!

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.800
Is this a smile!
Do it with style!

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:34.920
Maya!

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.520
Now the boss will be thrashed!

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:47.080
Father! Get up! Look!
Maya is not in her bed!

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.840
Look down. Maybe she
fell down in her sleep.

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.520
Don't joke, father! I'm worried!

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:59.920
Don't worry. She's not a kid. I
mean she must be in the bathroom.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.240
Go and find her! This
house is not a Taj Mahal!

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:05.920
Go! - How do I go? Mother
is standing down there.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:07.320
Then go from here!

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.160
Climb down! - How? Shall I jump?

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.360
Jump! - Jump!?

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:23.640
I'll break my bones? - Grandpa is
going to break your bones anyway.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:28.760
Father! She's not in the bathroom too!
God knows where she has gone!

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.320
She is not a child to get lost!

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:33.200
Search properly! She
must be here only. Go!

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:36.840
What are you doing?

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:50.800
Why are you looking
at me like this?

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.200
Aren't you ashamed! My
honour is at stake!

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.120
What are you doing? I'll die!

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.360
You are not even
telling me to stay.

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.240
Let mother come! Let
any storm arrive!

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.360
I can fight the whole world!
Just hold my hands!

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.000
Right now you are
holding my wraparound.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.760
Has Maya gone up?

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.080
She must have gone to dry chillies.
- Are chillies dried at night?

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:26.560
You mean to say that guy from
Patiala That music director!

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:31.200
He's a young guy. Maya is a child.
Did that loafer entice her?

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.320
I'll thrash that ***! You go up!

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.000
I can't climb the
stairs in this old age!

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:49.760
Maya!

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:56.000
My wraparound! Give my wraparound!
- Don't shout!

01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:02.320
My wraparound! Give my wraparound!
Throw it up!

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.160
Where are you taking my wraparound?
Give it back!

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.000
Oh my God! Why did I see this?

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.120
Doctor! - Yes, sister.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.120
I've called all the hospitals
and nursing homes.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.360
Mr. Prem has not been
admitted anywhere. - I see!

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.360
Sister, do one thing. Call up all
the charitable homes and lodges.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:43.920
He must be somewhere.

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.720
I'm very happy today, dear!

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.120
It's a full moon day today
and a Thursday too.

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:55.600
The priest says that today
is an auspicious day.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.600
We'll replace your nuptial
thread with a necklace.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.120
Till now you were a
guest in this house.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:07.760
Today, you'll bond with
this family for a lifetime.

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:13.920
These are our
ancestral jewellery.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.760
You might find it old-fashioned.

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.400
But wear it for
sometime for my sake.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:24.520
Touch Anand's feet and
take his blessing.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.520
No! I don't like this old
tradition of touching one's feet!

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.680
Anand! Look, don't leave.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Daughter-in-law, wear this
dress and the jewellery.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.280
No! It's not necessary
for you to obey mother.

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:36.760
Prem Pratap from Patiala.
6/26, Old Colony, Patiala.

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.200
Sir! The photo has arrived!
Shall I hang it in the hall?

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.000
No! The frame is not right.
I'll have to change it.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.960
Keep it aside for now. I'll
decide later. - Okay, sir.

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.800
Hello! 7468! Patiala!
Is Dr. Singh there?

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.560
Hello, Mr. Singh! This
is Anand from Mumbai!

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.080
Yes! Everything is fine! I
troubled you for an urgent work.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.600
I want to find Mr. Prem Pratap!

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.360
Yes, I'll give you the address.
Send somebody to find him!

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:22.480
Book the ticket and send him
to Mumbai on the first flight.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.800
No! He hasn't stolen my things.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:30.000
Actually I have something
that belongs to him!

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.840
I want to return his belongings!
Please write it down!

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:40.920
Prem Pratap from Patiala!
6/26, Old Colony, Patiala.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.120
I came to Mumbai 25 years ago.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.680
I looked so fine at that time!
So many girls flirted with me.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.520
But I too didn't budge! I
didn't look at anybody!

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:53.400
Otherwise would I
have had this garage,

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:55.800
..this truck and 6 cabs today?

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.920
But sir, you came here
to earn your livelihood.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:02.400
My boss came here for love.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.800
This love affair has been going
on since we arrived in Mumbai.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.480
Snacks were sent in the morning,

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.320
..and the girl would
come upstairs at night.

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.240
He's giving her bangles.
They are singing songs.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.800
Romantic! - Shut up, Chotu!

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:17.840
You brought the snacks! You
made me compose songs!

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Now you're acting smart!

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.280
You are the root cause of all
the problems! Wait! Come here!

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.200
Stop fighting and
concentrate on your work!

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:26.680
What work do you do?
- He's a musician.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.160
That's fine! But
what work do you do?

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.800
Isn't composing music
for movies, work?

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.400
Arrange for your
basic needs first.

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:37.800
You can pursue music after that.
Find a good job first.

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:40.920
Nurse!

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.120
Mangala! Laxmi!

01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:51.120
Nurse!

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.600
Mangala!

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:56.640
Laxmi!

01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.560
Where's Mangala?!
- What's the matter, mother?

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.120
Where has everybody gone?
Please call the nurse.

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:10.520
Nurse has taken a leave. Tell me.
What do you want? - No! I...

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.280
Tell me!
- The bedpan... I'll take it.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:20.480
No, daughter-in-law! Let it be!

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:29.400
Thank you Maya. Thank
you very much!

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.480
Even the real daughter-in-law
of this house,

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:34.520
..would've hesitated to do this job.
But you...

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:38.640
Mr. Prem is a lucky man.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.120
Boss, let's begin!

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.240
You look there. I'll look here.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.400
Let's see who is
destined to find work.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.120
Buy this! At a cheap price! Only 50
paisa! You won't get it tomorrow!

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.560
It's a steal! Have tea in this!
The tea will taste delicious!

01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:22.120
You'll look like a hero if you use
this comb! At throw away price!

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:56.800
Mom!

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.120
What happened, Chanda?
How did you fall?

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.800
I climbed up to
switch on the geyser.

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.720
The bucket slipped and I fell down.
- Come!

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.480
Who told you to climb up? What
if you had hurt yourself?

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:20.560
Why didn't you call me?
- Dad wants me to do my own work.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.600
Because you'll return to
your house in a week's time.

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.280
As long as I'm here, I'll
do your work. Understand?

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.240
Thank you, mom.
You're very sweet!

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.160
Good morning, boss! No need to
get dazed! This is our own shop!

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.800
It was difficult keeping
the goods on the street.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:17.800
So I made a new arrangement.
Sit here.

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:23.120
Quickly get 2 cups of tea.
My boss has come!

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.400
I will just get it! - Sit boss!

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.840
Don't call me your boss!

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.080
I'm ashamed to think that you've
learnt this after being with me!

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:33.680
To steal and cheat!

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:39.800
You've started preaching again!
Look, boss. No man is a born thief.

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:42.600
This merciless world,
merciless situations,

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:45.680
..turn a boy like
me into a thief.

01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.480
This is the norm of the world.

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.760
Commit sins and then
pray in the temple.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.120
All your sins will be cleansed.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.120
I'll slap you back
to your senses!

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.360
Fine, boss. Nobody
can reform you.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
You have capability, but
only to face rejections.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.720
You turned out to be so stooped!

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:12.080
My servant is coming. Don't
talk like this for sometime.

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:17.880
It will tarnish my image. Talk
to me respectfully for now.

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.000
Here! - Give it to boss.

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:22.400
Sir!

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.120
Boss!

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.160
Ganesh! - Yes sir!

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.480
Where's Chanda?
- She's in madam's room, sir!

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:48.600
Chanda!

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:50.920
Chanda!

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.680
Chanda! Get up, dear!
Dad is calling you.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.480
Dear, come and sleep in your room.
- I'll sleep here with mom!

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:07.400
Don't trouble your mom! Get up!
Go to your room!

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.800
I'll be no problem to mom, dad!

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.200
Am I right, mom? You too
come and sleep with us.

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.200
Don't talk rubbish! Quickly
get up and come with me!

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:20.320
I won't come! - Chanda!
Didn't you hear what I said!?

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.120
Didn't you hear what I said!
- Shameless!

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.800
How dare you mimic me! Get up! Come
to your room! - No, I won't go!

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.000
I'll sleep with mom!
- Chanda, keep quiet!

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:32.560
Now come!

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:35.480
Dad, I'll sleep with mom!
- Listen!

01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:39.760
Was it necessary to vent
out my anger on the child?

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:41.400
Yes!

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.400
Because she was insisting for
something which I couldn't give her.

01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:49.200
If Chanda gets used
to a mother's love,

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:53.120
..then how will I give it
to her after you leave?

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.120
I can't marry again.

01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.320
My time's bad! I'm being
forced to listen to you.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:08.200
Boss, you've ruined your life
and now you are wailing.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.480
If you couldn't take any responsibility
then you should've told me before.

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.400
I went to have lunch and here
you played the harmonium.

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.720
All the goods disappeared and
you didn't even realize it.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.680
Amazing!
- Stolen goods are bound to be stolen!

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:22.840
What else will be the outcome?

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.680
You say that your entire
goods are stolen.

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.920
Look at this! Was this drum stolen?
No! What does this mean?

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:33.240
It means, no matter
how much I try,

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:36.080
.. I won't reach great heights
till you are with me.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:45.080
Chotu, it means you share
a deep bond with music.

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.160
It's an unbreakable bond. That's
why your drum wasn't stolen.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.320
Oh my God! - There's never a
loss in honest deals, Chotu!

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.000
Forget this shop
and come with me.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.800
I'll take you to the
glamorous world of music.

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.800
Oh my God! What sin
have I committed?

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.400
We haven't committed
any sin, Chotu!

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:13.000
So someday we'll surely shake
up the world of music.

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:19.160
Even children will take Prem
Pratap from Patiala's name.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.240
Mr. Prem.

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.800
Greetings! How do
you know my name?

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.760
Not just yours, I even
know Chotu's name...

01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.400
I know Chotu's name, too. I
was looking for you people.

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.800
Did I steal your goods?

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.240
Actually, I'm a film producer.

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:46.840
I know you are the musician who had
refused to steal somebody's music.

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:48.920
I'm Anand.

01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:54.600
I want you to compose
music for my movies.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.400
Give me your address. I'll
send a car to pick you up.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.040
We can give an address
only if we have a house.

01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:06.920
For the moment, the
footpath is our address.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.920
Fine! No problem!

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.000
I'll arrange for your accommodation.
Come with me.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.960
I won't be able to come today.
Cancel all my appointments.

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.000
If there is any urgent
work, call me on 545281.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.440
This is our first chance.

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.280
I'll play such tunes
for the producer,

01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:32.760
..that he'll sign us as the music
director for all his movies.

01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:35.560
Boss, don't worry. I'm with you.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:42.320
So will you play something?
- What do you want to hear?

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.400
Anything. A love song?

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:48.320
Look how can I play anything?

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.120
I should know what the story is,
what the situation is. - Fine!

01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:03.160
The situation is that a girl
and a boy love each other.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.760
The girl's family forced her
to marry some other guy.

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:15.280
Wow! Your movie is a hit! What
a story! People will go crazy!

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:17.920
Shut up! Fool!

01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.640
What's so great
about this story?

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.880
It's a common story. This
happens in all the movies.

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:30.160
This isn't the whole story.
This is just the beginning.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:37.000
The heroine consumes poison on
the first night of her wedding.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:40.000
You mean to say the heroine
dies in the first reel itself.

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:44.640
No. She was saved because
her husband is a doctor.

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.120
On asking the reason
for consuming poison,

01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.520
..the heroine speaks the truth.

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.800
She was forced to get married and
that she loves somebody else.

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.240
Wow! The girl is so courageous!

01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:03.400
Her husband promises the heroine
that he'll find her love anyhow.

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:09.360
He'll unite both of them again.
- Wow! Great!

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:15.080
That husband is not human.
He's God!

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.320
But this husband
too has a problem.

01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.120
His mother is sick.
She's on her death bed.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.800
So he requests the heroine,

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:41.280
..to play the charade of being the
daughter-in-law for 6-7 days.

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:45.000
On one hand, is the mother who
will live for 6-7 days only,

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.080
..on the other hand, the wife
who is eager to meet her lover.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:55.000
In all this, what must
be the husband's plight?

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.600
Then what happened?
- The end has to be written.

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:05.600
I'll narrate it to you
as the story progresses.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.080
You've left me in suspense. When
will your story get completed?

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:13.800
Very soon.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.720
Till then, you
compose a love song.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:21.480
For the beginning, when the
hero and the heroine meet.

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.480
Such a serious story,
such painful turns,

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:26.960
..and you're asking me
to compose a love song?

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:28.120
Fine!

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:51.520
"You don't..."

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:29.280
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:34.000
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:39.960
"You don't give your
heart, it gets stolen!"

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:45.080
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:56.520
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.720
"You don't give your
heart, it gets stolen!"

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.240
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:12.640
"You don't give your
heart, it gets stolen!"

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:45.800
"There's no pressure on love,"

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:51.240
"You lose your sleep over it!"

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:57.000
"Listening to the heart,"

01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:01.840
"in long twilights,"

01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:07.600
"lovers don't sleep!"

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:13.120
"That's why it's said,"

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.880
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:24.160
"You don't give your
heart, it gets stolen!"

01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:59.400
"The bond of the heart is such,"

01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:04.720
"The bond of the heart is such,"

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:10.520
"don't ask about the
plight of my heart!"

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:16.320
"I'm in grave trouble,"

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:21.200
"I miss you!"

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.480
"I miss you!"

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:33.400
"Tears brim in my eyes!"

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:38.800
"That's why it's said,"

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.680
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.800
"You don't give your
heart, it gets stolen!"

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:09.200
"In the season of
these flowers,"

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:20.080
"in the season of
these flowers,"

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:25.520
"love pierces thorn, and
it hurts the heart!"

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:31.600
"We endure everything
with a smile!"

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:36.800
"That's why it's said,"

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.320
"You don't fall in love
deliberately, it just happens!"

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:47.800
"You don't give your
heart, it gets stolen!"

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.120
Nurse! - Yes, doctor.

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.600
Quickly arrange for the glucose.
Tell Saxena to come here quickly.

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.280
Arrange for the oxygen, too.
- Okay.

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:57.360
You're a doctor yourself. You know
what the patient's condition is.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:01.080
The effect of the tranquilizer
given will last for sometime.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.000
It's difficult to say what will be the
patient's state after she wakes up.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:07.600
Anyway. Let's hope for the best.

01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.720
If possible then get out
from this atmosphere.

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:41.520
Boss, the producer has come.

01:58:43.800 --> 01:58:49.000
You've kept me in suspense. You
narrated half the story and left.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:51.600
Here, I'm tensed thinking
what will happen next.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.960
I shouldn't interfere
in your matter.

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:58.560
But I think till the time
the mother doesn't die,

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.120
..your story won't proceed.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:05.160
After the mother dies, the
doctor will face the real test.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.920
Anand speaking.

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:38.120
This is Ganesh speaking, sir.
Your mother is no more.

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.800
Just 5 minutes ago. Sir, we
are waiting for you only.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:44.680
Hello! Doctor!

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:10.400
You didn't tell me. Did
the mother die? Tell me!

02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:15.640
I think she should die!
What do you say?

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:20.400
She died. - What?

02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:28.560
Yes. She died.

02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:31.320
Wow! Now there will be
a twist in the story!

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:35.160
But don't add a song here. Everybody
adds songs on the mother.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.080
But in this situation, I'll give
such a background music that,

02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:39.640
..everybody will tear up.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.560
I'll play it. Come on, Chotu!
Pick up the drum!

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.160
Look, this is a sad tune.

02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:47.920
I'll thrash you if you laugh. Got it?
- Fine.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.920
Not so fast. Play it slowly.

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:14.000
Boss! Boss!

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.720
The producer is crying.

02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:27.400
This is the effect of our tune.

02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.280
I've only played the harmonium.

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.280
Watch the effect when it's
played with 50 piece orchestra.

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:36.280
Each person in the theatre will cry.
Come on!

02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:10.000
Prem Pratap from Patiala!
Music director!

02:03:10.480 --> 02:03:13.120
Hello, Mr. Prem.
- Greetings, sir.

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.760
I was waiting for you since morning.
- Do one thing.

02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:21.840
Take a cab and come to
my house immediately.

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:27.160
The address is Savitri villa.
10th Road, Juhu Parle Scheme.

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.400
I'll come immediately, sir.

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:31.840
But at least tell me. What have
you decided about the climax?

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:35.800
Mr. Prem, I'll decide the climax
after taking your opinion.

02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.600
So please come here immediately.

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.640
Dad, what is a climax?

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:50.160
Separating two bodies
and uniting two souls.

02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:58.400
Greetings! - Greetings!

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.160
I've come to meet Mr. Anand.

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.400
Prem Pratap from Patiala.
Music director.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:03.200
Come, have a seat.

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:19.560
The producer is rich.
He's an influential man.

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:24.120
He'll surely complete the movie
by selling his house if needed.

02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:30.800
Sit. You've reached
the right place.

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:53.720
Greetings, sir! - Greetings!

02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:56.160
I was waiting for you.

02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:04.320
Sir, you look tired. Are you fine?
- Yes. Just like that. Come.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.800
I understand, sir. I
understand your dilemma.

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:11.600
When a man is in deep thought
and he can't decide anything,

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.080
..he feels distressed.
- Come. Sit down.

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:16.960
To tell you the truth. I'm too
thinking about the climax.

02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.000
I can't even eat properly.
- Please sit.

02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.480
Then you must have
reached some conclusion.

02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:27.640
What should be the climax of
this story according to you?

02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:31.320
Look, sir. There are only
two ends to this story.

02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:35.560
One is that the heroine
forgets her lover and,

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:38.800
..spends her life happily
with her husband.

02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:40.800
The happy ending.

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:46.400
The other end is that the
heroine forgets her,

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:48.480
..lover and her husband
and leaves this world.

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:52.400
Again she consumes poison.
The sad ending.

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:56.800
Mr. Prem, I think you're
a heartless man. - What?

02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:01.000
You're forcing that girl to
spend her life with a man,

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.120
..she married
against her wishes.

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:10.080
This is injustice! This
happens in all the movies.

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:15.000
Secondly, why should she
consume poison again?

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:17.120
What is her fault?

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:24.360
But sir, there can't be a third
climax to this story. - Why not?

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:30.480
If that husband is a noble man, he
can unite the separated lovers.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.640
No, sir! That's
absolutely wrong!

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:35.960
Even I thought of this.

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:39.400
But people won't accept this climax.
- Why?

02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:45.720
Because sir, we have some
tradition, values and feelings.

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:51.160
According to that, once a
man marries a woman and,

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.600
..gives her the nuptial thread,
then she belongs to him.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.640
That woman becomes his wife
for the rest of her life.

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:03.800
Once the 7 nuptial rounds of the
fire are taken with the oath,

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:05.560
..it can't be broken.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:08.800
If 2 people married
according to the rituals,

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:11.280
..can't maintain the
relation for some reason,

02:07:11.840 --> 02:07:15.000
..then the law gives them the
permission to seek divorce.

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.400
Foreigners resort to a divorce, sir!
We are Indians!

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:22.320
In our country, a
woman has to spend,

02:07:22.440 --> 02:07:24.400
..her life only with her
husband once marriage.

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.480
So Mr. Prem, why doesn't this rule
apply on the men of our country?

02:07:30.800 --> 02:07:33.000
Even after marriage, many
marry for the second time,

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:36.360
..or have extra-marital affairs.

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:40.640
Then how does your tradition and
value accept them in the society?

02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:46.240
Why only women have to
obey the marriage rituals?

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:51.240
Why not men?
- Sir, you have confused me.

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:54.280
You have put me in a dilemma.

02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.800
My intention was not to
put you in a dilemma,

02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:01.000
..but to solve this problem.
Sit.

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:06.160
Killing that girl or
forcing her to live,

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:13.840
..with someone she doesn't
love is sinful! It's wrong.

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:20.760
The right thing to do is to unite
that girl with her lover again.

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:24.920
Am I right? - Okay.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.240
Very good, sir!

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.600
Are you saying it for my sake or
do you really think so? - No, sir!

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:36.280
You've explained everything
so clearly that,

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:37.800
I think this is the
right thing to do.

02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:42.160
It will be a new climax.
Novelty!

02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:45.160
Very good, sir! It
will be revolutionary!

02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:47.160
People won't even be able
to think of this climax!

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:52.480
Good that you agreed with me.

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:56.120
Come upstairs.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:08:59.280
Upstairs?

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:06.120
You have given your consent. Now
let me fulfil my duty too. Come.

02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:09.560
Sir, do you mean
advance payment?

02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.520
Yes! Assume it's an advance.
Come.

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:21.480
Advance? Good! Very good, sir!

02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:25.360
You have thought of a fine climax!
Very good!

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:29.000
Lovely story! Unexpected twists!

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.560
Your movie is a hit!

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.800
With Goddess Saraswati's grace,

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:36.560
..the music will complete
a silver jubilee.

02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:41.080
Why silver jubilee?
Golden jubilee, sir!

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:44.000
Sir, it has really been
a pleasure meeting you!

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:47.720
What character! What a
theme for the story, sir!

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:48.800
Wonderful! Beautiful...

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:10.200
I'm sorry, Mr. Prem.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.960
But if I had told
you this earlier,

02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:15.760
..that Maya is the girl
who had consumed poison,

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:17.560
..on the first night
of the wedding,

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.440
..and that I am her husband,

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:24.200
..we wouldn't have been
able to talk clearly.

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.000
We would've never been able
to reach the right decision.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:29.600
That's why I had to
play this drama.

02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:35.960
Forgive me if I have hurt you.

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:44.320
Maya, I'm fulfilling my promise.

02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:48.160
Though for my own
selfish reasons,

02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:56.120
I made you stay in this house for 7
days. I'm sorry for hurting you.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:02.600
The sad story that began
with this marriage,

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.400
..has now become the happy
story of two lovers' union.

02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.800
I'm happy. My best
wishes are with you.

02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:16.240
Goodbye! Good luck! - Sir! Sir!

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:19.360
This isn't right!

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:22.320
Your climax is not right! It's wrong!
- Why?

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:24.960
Just a while ago you
only had accepted it.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.200
Yes! Everything is fair in movies.
But this is real life.

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.280
Such endings can't
happen in life, sir!

02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:36.200
But Mr. Prem, stories,
novels, movies,

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:38.920
..all this should
portray real life.

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:41.400
I don't want to argue whether they
should or shouldn't portray life.

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:45.080
I accepted your climax because

02:11:45.240 --> 02:11:47.800
I didn't want to lose my chance
of being a music director.

02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:51.400
Otherwise I can never accept
such a derogatory thing.

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:57.400
Maya is your wife. She has
to spend her life with you.

02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:01.560
But how do I accept your climax, Mr.
Prem?

02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.720
Knowing that the girl who
has come in my house,

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:07.920
..as my wife loves
somebody else.

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:09.920
She loves you.

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:14.920
I can't torment myself
by making her my wife.

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:20.160
Life will become hell. For
me as well as for Maya.

02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.760
There's only one solution to this
problem. Take Maya with you.

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.480
No, sir. This isn't possible.

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:35.200
If you will leave her here, she'll
surely consume poison again.

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:36.760
Will that be acceptable to you?

02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:43.960
Can you let your beloved die?

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:48.160
What kind of a man are you?
What kind of a lover are you?

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:01.200
Fine, sir.

02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:04.480
I'll take Maya with me.

02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:07.160
But not this Maya,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.160
..return the same Maya, I
had fallen in love with.

02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:18.160
Mr. Prem, do you doubt me? - No,
sir! I am not such a stooped man!

02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:19.600
I'll never doubt you!

02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:25.200
I mean to say that Maya is wearing
the nuptial thread given by you.

02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:29.600
If I touch her, I'll feel as
if I am committing a sin.

02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:32.840
As if I have brought home
somebody else's wife.

02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:38.680
If this nuptial thread is
removed, I'll get my Maya back.

02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:46.080
Maya, give this nuptial thread back
to the doctor and come with me.

02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:53.640
What happened, Maya?

02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:57.080
A nuptial thread is nothing but
an ordinary yellow thread.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.480
It's like a golden license.

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.000
Remove it and come with me.

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:14.200
Why are you thinking so much?
It's just a display.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.720
Remove it! Remove this worthless
thing! What does it have?

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.120
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:31.120
'I accept this nuptial thread,'

02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:33.800
'considering the sacred
fire as the witness,'

02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.960
'considering God
as the witness,'

02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:39.120
'the celestial bodies
as the witness,'

02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:42.400
'considering the saints and
sages as the witness,'

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.400
'I give this oath,'

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:48.800
'that I'll hold this nuptial
thread dearer than my life.'

02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:52.280
'I'll uphold its
dignity all my life.'

02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:08.200
Dad called and said its okay if
you don't want to meet grandma.

02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:12.000
But have your breakfast and
do take your medicine.

02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:13.560
That is most important.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.800
If Chanda got used
to mother's love,

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.840
..then how will I give it
to her after you leave?

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:30.160
Today you're going to bond with
this family for a lifetime.

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:34.520
Maya is an Indian girl with
orthodox thinking, sir.

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:39.720
She's still in a dilemma
about the nuptial thread.

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:44.800
She doesn't know of this new
world and the new revolution.

02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:49.280
You explained that to me
and I've understood too.

02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:54.800
Sir, I think you should do it.

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:59.200
You remove the nuptial thread.
Do it!

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.760
You are a man. What
are you afraid of?

02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:11.480
You have the right to
disobey this old tradition.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.960
Pull out this nuptial
thread from Maya's neck.

02:16:16.440 --> 02:16:18.080
So that I can take her with me.

02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:27.480
What are you thinking, sir? These
orthodox rituals are of no use!

02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.560
Break these bonds! Go ahead!

02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:39.240
Yes, mother.

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:41.600
I'll do everything for
Maya's happiness.

02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:45.720
I'll fulfil all her wishes.
I promise you.

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:08.800
No!

02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:34.280
No!

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.360
This is our story, sir.

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:48.400
The story of our country's
tradition and values.

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:52.000
I'm not an educated man.

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:58.480
But I do know that my lover
may become somebody's wife,

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:02.120
..but somebody's wife
can never be my lover.

02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:05.280
The heart of an unmarried
woman is like a mirror.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:11.560
It reflects the one
who stands before it.

02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:17.400
But after marriage, that reflection
gets converted into an image, sir.

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:23.200
A husband's image. Your image.

02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:25.800
This will never change.

02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:30.080
This can be the only
climax to this story.

02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.760
Nothing else. Never!

02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.360
You might find my
thinking orthodox.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.400
It is very old. But
sir, old is gold.

02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:45.560
I'll take your leave now.

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:47.760
Goodbye, Mr. Anand.

02:18:48.600 --> 02:18:52.640
Sorry, Mrs. and Mr.
Anand. Goodbye!
