How will you go on?

518
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Today's bus strike.

519
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,291
Every girl has to seek to lift his fellow boy.

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,416
it was in the paper today.

523
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,625
Special radio news came today.

524
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:23,708

00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,541
If bus will nt come today then todays

534
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,291
Come sit on the scooter.

535
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,500
I do not sit on the scoote

536
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,500
I will go away on foot.

537
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,666
If you go away on foot,

538
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,333
you will be late in reaching college.

539
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,500
And if you arrive late in college

540
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,375
your class necessary will be missed

541
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,416
And if you have to miss a class

542
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,083
then you will fail.

543
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,125
Lets go.

544
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:04,500
Lets go.

545
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,291
Scooter is my new

546
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:08,458
very fast runs

547
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:09,500
Hence the fear of falling.

548
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,166
Just do hold me tight.

549
00:29:12,666 --> 00:29:16,166
And, and, a little closer

550
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:20,708
If you do that

551
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:21,500
then I will go off the scooter

552
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,500
Oh, no, no, hold it up.

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,666
Otherwise you will fall.

554
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,666
Let's go.

555
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:38,500

00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:40,458
I was waiting for.

558
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:41,083
Why?

559
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:41,916
Why not?

560
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,333
I had gone to the front

561
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:44,500
If anything happens to you

562
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,208
and all the blame falls on me

563
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,333
Oh how that could be?

564
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,250

Tell me

568
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,500

Oh God, which has been written

586
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,416
and will remain in coincidences

587
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:54,583
Do not think such stupid things

588
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:58,500
Sit and read.

589
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,416

592
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,333

593
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:13,500
Yes son

594
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,958
You can go city at any sitiuation

595
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,458
and son bring him to somehow bail

596
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,000
i Also agree he is dirty and

597
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,166
But looking his grandmother face

598
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,083
something will have to do for him.

599
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,416
Go son.

600
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,541
The sergeant to release me, right?

601
00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:31,250
I knew

602
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,041
because the freedom fighters

603
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,875
Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar, , Mahatma Gandhi

604
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:37,916
was in jail

605
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,541
Then came the revolution in the country.

606
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,625
People were eating chestnuts on

607
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:48,208
Government had created panic among the tents.

608
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:49,500
So when

609
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,958
you do not have the freedom of the city

610
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:54,500
in the country and the revolution comes

611
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,375
Spherical moving,

612
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,500
dump bodies

613
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,625
fire, strike, neither, not knowing what is happened

614
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,583
Nothing happened.

615
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:02,500
Come on

00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,583

618
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,500
Rambabu,

619
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,500

after today

621
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,208
should remember one thing,

622
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:20,375
the country's central Madan is not alone.

623
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,500
The lawyers of the line is

624
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,458
Rambabu

625
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,166
We both belong to the same village

626
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,750
You did very well that, today

627
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,041
If God willing

628
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,500
God would surely

629
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,625
tomorrow I will come to rescue you on bail

630
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,916
No.

631
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,750
A great favor to me and the villagers.

632
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,041
It is true.

633
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:44,500
But Ram Babu

634
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,125
what it case on me

635
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,125
, I am going to Bajaru woman

636
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,000
police terrible mistake.

637
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:51,666
How?

638
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:53,166
Such that,

639
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,916
I'd just damage good girls

640
00:32:56,416 --> 00:33:00,041
Which is poorly bad, i never touch them.

641
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,500
How's my this dialog?

642
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,666
Raghu uncle you recite the dialog

643
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:06,500
you will repair the poles.

644
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,791
Raghuveer?

645
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,833
You are the name of your family to be a stigma.

646
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,083
Did you just spit on the face of his family and the entire village is not.

647
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,041
Black mouth reaches notoriety.

648
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,833
If that's the case, I put away out of the village

649
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,500
to give me a share of property

650
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,625
I go out of the village rushed to

651
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,875
You get nothing until your grandmother is alive

652
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,125
All his life he had this old heart and flesh is real butter

653
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:30,291
Very strong

654
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,500
not easily going to die so soon

655
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,375
Easy Rider is somewhere waiting for my death.

656
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,708
Remember you will not be penniless.

657
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,500
How would not?

658
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,875
Within a week

659
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,916
if the property has not been decided and I did not get my share,

660
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,500
I am outraged at this village,

661
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,875
Sataunga people, lift up sleeping

662
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,583
People will cry

663
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,791
and then he moved to take my complaint come to you

664
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,958
Will you be forced to give my share

665
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:02,958
If it was, I do not sit in peace

666
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,083
What do you think about this drama?

667
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:28,166
Do not you ever forget this again.

668
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:29,500
You know

669
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,791
I was so nervous?

670
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,208
Hey I just wanted to see that

671
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,541
if something happens to me

672
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,916
it would have some effect on you or not.

673
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:42,875
What do you think if something happens to you

674
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,041
will be alive Lalita

675
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,500
If I died,

676
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,666
I will die.

677
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,000
If I fell into the river,

678
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,166
So I will go with you fall into the river.

679
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:51,791
If I committed suicide,

680
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,416
So I'll take himself.

681
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,708
If I may take the puppy to hold you tight.

682
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:58,083
I'll take the puppy grabs.

683
00:34:58,583 --> 00:34:59,750
So why the delay has hurry

684
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,041

692
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:18,875
Otherwise my sister will kill me.

693
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,500
Hey you, do not worry about your sister.

694
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,083

Do not increase or hit the Go.

697
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,291
It will not do everything in front of my sister

698
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:30,750
Tomorrow, I shall assume that you own

699
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,375
Ram Babu is the brain, the mind of a lawyer

700
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:37,500
Yes yes see.

701
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,833
Is it what are you saying?

702
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,500
Janaki, a teacher of Lalita was

703
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,500
Well, he told me

704
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,833
he is good in every subject

705
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,666
expect botany.

706
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:53,250
What Botany?

707
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,416
He will fail if he dont have

708
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:58,833
Oh you do not know about Botany?,

709
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:00,291
Botany is a Botany

710
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,916
if she has failed in botany

711
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,791
she want homework again from children's class

712
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,291
How many years will be wasted.

713
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,500
And will lose money.

714
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
So my friend advised to me

715
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,500

I was the champion of Botany,

718
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,041
When I was in college

719
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,500
people would say to me

720
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,208

730
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,416
when given a little time to teach her

731
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,500
Well, when you're doing such a recommendation

732
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,375
then i have to do something.

733
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:46,166
But first ask her that

735
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,500

And i studied science.

753
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:24,291
Maybe they do not know

754
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,500
Do not know a word

If I had to say, i cant speak looking to you,

1171
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:42,500
So you have to close your eyes.

1172
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,500
And, if I had to speak

1173
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,375
so you have to shut your eyes to you

1174
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:51,375
otherwise I will not even speak.

1175
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,708
Hey where is this money?

1176
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,458
It has stuck anywhere?

1177
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:06,500
I do not know where did it go?

1178
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,000

No, not, say.

01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:24,916

01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:50,416
Parvati aunt asked me about this relationship

1189
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:53,500
How could I deny?

1190
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,750

1194
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,291
And their attitude seems to me he too.

1195
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:22,708
Truly speaking after seeing them in

1196
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,500
It is often used to think

1197
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,291
if alive, I could not become her,

1198
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:32,291
I can not become someone

1199
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:36,833
I will give my life.

1200
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:44,916

01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:12,375
Have you had your eyes closed?

Do not try to play me.

1277
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:19,500
Fate is playing me, kamesh.

1278
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,791
The hands of fate to become a toy,

1279

Me, I'm ready to marry you.

1284
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:33,583
Lalita,

1285
01:08:34,083 --> 01:08:35,583

1286
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:37,583
You speak so I jumped down

1287
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:40,000
Do you know, I went inside to give soda bottle.

1288
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,750
Am ready to marry you, Lalita.

1289
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:44,916
But on the condition.

1290
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:47,625
I accept all your conditions.

1291
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,666
Listen first, kamesh.

1292
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:55,083
I will not ask you anything about your past today.

1293
01:08:55,583 --> 01:09:02,333
Neither you ask me about my past tomorrow

1294
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:04,833
I want only flowers smell

1295
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:06,125
i dont want to know Who hit plant?

1296
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:08,208
Who gave the water, who is the gardener?

1297
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,958
That means nothing to me, Lalita.

1298
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:14,166
I just care about the future,

1299
01:09:14,666 --> 01:09:18,166
which was not your past.

1300
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,500
We both got married.

1301
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,416
No

1302
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,958
It can not be.

1303
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:13,666
That's a lie.

1304
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,750
It's a lie, right?, Lalita.

1305
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,750
No

1306
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,750
It is true, sister.

Today, we are husband and wife.

01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,708
Beware, which again came the

It can not be your husband.

1310
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You can not wear this necklace.

1311
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,875
It's a lie, is false.

1312
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,500

1313
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,333

But murder is a crime,

1524
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,041
Do it by kamesh.

1525
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:29,166
Therefore, the court sentenced him to

01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:30,875
Lalita

1527
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,708
I know, you are very sorry.

1528
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:36,500
After the wedding, we could not spend

But you do not worry.

1530
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,291
It's a matter of just 7 years.

1531
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:43,291
And it will fly away like 7 years 7 minutes.

1563
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:20,333
And they had agreed happily.

1564
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,375
Janaki

1565
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,500

1566
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,375

Tell me something good,

1570
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:47,500
promiscuous before marriage,

1571
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,708
or any incident that you recall.

1572
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:55,500
On the night before she was married,

1573
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,416
also with me.

1574
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:02,416
We talked for a long time.

1575
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:15,500
Such a long time has passed.

1576
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,791
Bus,

1577
01:26:17,291 --> 01:26:18,875

1579
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:25,250
I did not understand until now,

1580
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:28,375
Lalita why doing it?

1581
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:30,500
But I have understood,

1582
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,875
you are thinking absolately right, Ram.

1583
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:36,458
Your idea is absolutely correct.

1584
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,500
Lalita when she know

1585
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,083

01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,416
So she, her sister's wedding to

1587
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,916
that married kamesh Jalil. And

1588
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:49,291
herself, in the eyes of the world has dropped.

1589
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:51,916
She had sacrificed so much.

1590
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,666
And could not understand any

1591
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:58,083
But uncle, how can I live without her

1592
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,291
What is left in my life?

1593
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:01,625
Janaki was the same question,

1594
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:03,250
What you're doing.

1595
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,500
He also wanted to finish her life.

1596
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,500
Lalita but not such a big compromise

1597
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,500
You guys were disappointed with life have committed suicide

1598
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,750
But because of that,

1599
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,458
You get another one.

1600
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:19,458
Be each other's support.

1601
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,625
You have to respect the sacrifice of Lalita,

1602
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:25,500
For which he killed himself alive,

1603
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,583
Cancer deaths do not desire and rejected.

1604
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:32,125

01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,291
Yes, Janaki.

1624
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:17,958

01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:33,166
But God does not give me children, why?

Why do I still not have children?

01:31:56,875 --> 01:31:57,666
Then I'll tell you mom

1686
01:31:58,166 --> 01:31:59,916
your son will get the first prize

1687
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:03,916
And could not find anyone.

1688
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:06,625
Yaronar,

1689
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:07,916
today your criminal law

1690
01:32:08,416 --> 01:32:09,500
one person is saying to you criminal.

1691
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,875
Today is the person whom you stayed

1692
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:11,500
Who made the perpetrator?

1693
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,458
The condition, his poverty

1694
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:14,500
his helplessness

1695
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,333
and society by increasing unemployment.

1696
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:17,500
If he is a criminal,

1697
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,541
your society is also criminal.

1698
01:32:20,041 --> 01:32:22,333
Only give the punishment crime will not be over.

1699
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:23,958
Crime is a poisonous tree

1700
01:32:24,458 --> 01:32:28,041
its root begins on biting. cutting

1701
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:30,166
accept it and I would dont say anything.

1702
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:34,166
That solve yaronar.

1703
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:43,500

1709
01:32:55,708 --> 01:32:57,750
Hey sister, you have said many times

1710
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,875
the children do not fast-worship,

1711
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,250
But you did not listen.

1712
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:03,291
The Look

1713
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:04,125

And saying that's going to happen

1716
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:14,750
Really Sundari? You are so lucky.

1717
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:16,333
Lucky?

1718
01:33:16,833 --> 01:33:18,500
Oh my bad luck started.

1719
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,750
Atmaram you're saying is like

1720
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:21,125
it's full blame of her

1721
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,125
all blame of her

And I will be bulldozed child

1728
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:34,541
I'll be the cause,

1729
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:35,500
I will be bulldozed.

1730
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,333
Sir, the decision to terminate, and you're generating.

1731
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:39,125
Wait,

1732
01:33:39,625 --> 01:33:41,083

01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:41,958

01:33:48,625 --> 01:33:50,375
the child will remain in any case

1739
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,750
What have you decided?

1740
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,625
I? Can not fight fate therefore,

1741
01:33:56,125 --> 01:33:57,083
I have decided

1742
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:59,958
We will adopt the child

1743
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:02,125
we'll take it.

1744
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:05,250
Oh wow that looks like the

1745
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:06,500

I am very happy with this decision

1749
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:19,500
Sister-in-law, what you are saying?

1750
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,041
Yes're right.

1751
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:23,000
You will give birth to my children,

1752
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,083
But the child will adopt.

1753
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:28,625
But in return we give you this ? 10000.

1754
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,125

Oh God, it looks like today, you have the

Ray my Dhanlakshmi

1757
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:39,500
so I think today was

1758
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,333
You did nothing but damage the stomach

1759
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:44,500
Today, I feel that after finding ? 10000,

1760
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,791
not a Baby in your womb, its lottery ticket.

1761
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:48,250
Sister-in-law, sister-in-law,

1762
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,208
let's get you booked on the next year.

1763
01:34:50,708 --> 01:34:53,500
What rubbish that you do not feel ashamed to live?

1764
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,416
Sister, I understand your feelings.

1765
01:34:57,916 --> 01:35:01,083
You want a child in your lap empty.

1766
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:04,416
And I'm glad that my child would

1767
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:08,416
Sister-in-low, I'm moving market.

1768
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:10,125
Not today you will not market,

1769
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:12,500
No household will work,

1770
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,291
Despite such a big lawyer

1771
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:15,958
took the trouble to come here and for him

1772
01:35:16,458 --> 01:35:17,375
thank you very much

1773
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:18,125
It's All Right,

1774
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:20,500
Anandpur which is your real estate

1775
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,500
you have the papers?

1776
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:33,458
May i come in sir?

1777
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:55,000
When she works here?

1778
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,500
In the past 5 years this branch of Mumbai

1779
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,958
was very smart and hardworking girl

1780
01:36:00,458 --> 01:36:01,708
We've got here is the transfer.

1781
01:36:02,208 --> 01:36:03,791
It is fortunate that

1782
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,500
as soon as it has found a place in

1783
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,291
But as far as, its own life is concerned,

1784
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:11,041
Poor very unlucky.

1785
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:12,041
Why?

1786
01:36:12,541 --> 01:36:14,041
The day got married

1787
01:36:14,541 --> 01:36:16,791
her husband was arrested the same night

1788
01:36:17,291 --> 01:36:18,500
Before the wedding

1789
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,208
the husband had cheated on a girl.

1790
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:22,666
Her life was ruined,

1791
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:25,208
The girl's brother attacked him

1792
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:29,208
and killed him by her husband in

1793
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:42,291
Gopi Hey, you here?

1794
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:43,791
We live here,

1795
01:36:44,291 --> 01:36:46,000
Today we are going to leave the house

1796
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,125
Then I thought

1797
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:51,125
I meet my friends.

1798
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,500
You saw me today after long years

1799
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:21,375
And after see decided the

1800
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:26,500
Once the storms and hurricanes that

1801
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:32,708
she changed back to the home before

1802
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:35,000
before you go

1803
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,708
Get answers only one question,

1804
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:41,625
I only love you have for life,

1805
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:43,625
obsessed with love.

1806
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:46,333
And you have murdered the love,

1807
01:37:46,833 --> 01:37:48,375
And by making the blood vermilion blood

1808
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:50,666
filled her sister in demand.

1809
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:54,541
Who gave you the right?

1810
01:37:55,041 --> 01:37:57,000
Came out of my own life,

1811
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,416
And your sister were left in my life.

1812
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:03,166
Who gave you that right?

1813
01:38:03,666 --> 01:38:06,500
Without asking me

1814
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,083
my dreams shattered,

1815
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:10,500
Killed my hopes,

1816
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,500
who gave you this freedom?

1817
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,500
Right, Authority, freedom,

1818
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,250
when something in my life has been

1819
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:29,833
The right to decide about his

1820
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:35,250
Right, Authority, freedom

1821
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:38,291
Your love and your innocence

1822
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:41,208
I was convinced.

1823
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:45,500
And in that moment

1824
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,583
What, it was my fault

1825
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:55,625
My sister is in love with you,

1826
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:57,458
Even

1827
01:38:57,958 --> 01:38:59,041
if you do not meet him,

1828
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:02,500
she is giving up her life so

1829
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,500
I was forced,

1830
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I felt my sister's funeral

1831
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,833
how could your wedding vows?

1832
01:39:11,333 --> 01:39:12,916
My sister is a goddess and goddess

1833
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:20,583
like you that only God can give all

1834
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:26,791
So I love you in the light of his life filling

1835
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:30,500
went into a different world.

1836
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
You brought light into the lives

1837
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,791
But got lost in the oblivion.

1838
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:40,833
A fallen human being married skunk variety.

1839
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:42,375
And then,

1840
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:44,416
it has undergone a life of loneliness

1841
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:46,083
Like this, to be alone in the world

1842
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:48,500
No one in this world of yours.

1843
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:52,208
No Lalita, there is a limit to everything.

1844
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:54,500
Now I will not let you spend this life.

1845
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:55,791
Come with me

1846
01:39:56,291 --> 01:39:59,541
now and at this time, come to my house.

1847
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:04,333
No, it's impossible,

1848
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:06,583
And this home

1849
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:08,500
not mine, my sister is right.

1850
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,458
If she know that,

1851
01:40:11,958 --> 01:40:14,166
I did everything for her happiness,

1852
01:40:14,666 --> 01:40:15,625
So,

1853
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,791
then, it will bear the shock.

1854
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:20,500
Yourself will end

1855
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,750
It is not alive and I'll never,

1856
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:27,916
He never knew that

1857
01:40:28,416 --> 01:40:31,750
I am here in this city,

1858
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:35,916
Therefore, I am going to leave this house

1859
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:40,000
and go away from here, Ram Babu.

1860
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,500
So you want us to leave,

1861
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,125
By now that movement we were

1862
01:40:45,625 --> 01:40:46,791
are leading a peaceful life

1863
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,708
If the mind was understood,

1864
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:50,041
Now

1865
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:55,625
after knowing what your reality will

1866
01:40:56,125 --> 01:40:58,083
And in my situation to see

1867
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:02,583
what your sister will not get in Happiness

1868
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:04,666
So what did you sacrifice?

Tell me, will you be able to keep this secret.

1878

The meeting

1884
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:29,208

Convergence

1886
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,875

1887
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:41,916
The love of centuries

1888
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:46,416
To be done in moments

1889
01:43:46,916 --> 01:43:50,416
Not knowing about the future

1890
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:03,500
The meeting

1891
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,500
Of waves with waves

1892
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:53,125
If a thirsty person doesnt drink water

1893
01:44:53,625 --> 01:44:57,500
The river levels will drop

1894
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,916
If someone doesnt pick the flowers

1895
01:45:02,416 --> 01:45:05,875
Its fragrance will spread

1896
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:14,583
The gifts of nature are for the whole world

1897
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:23,333
The showers of love

1898
01:45:23,833 --> 01:45:27,500
The love of centuries

1899
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,250
To be done in moments

1900
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:36,250

The meeting

1902
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,500
Of waves with waves

1903
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,333
The winds do not have enough power

1904
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:50,416
To blow away a butterfly from a flower

1905
01:46:50,916 --> 01:46:54,625
Even tornados cannot stop

1906
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:58,791
The determination of love

1907
01:46:59,291 --> 01:47:03,375
The seasons are singing

1908
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:07,500
The music of happiness

1909
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:15,958
Then why is there loneliness in the heart

1910
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:20,208
The love of centuries

1911
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:24,875
To be done in moments

1912
01:47:25,375 --> 01:47:28,875
Not knowing about the future

1913
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:41,291
The meeting

1914
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:45,500
Of waves with waves

1915
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,708
Convergence

1916
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:52,708
Of clouds with clouds

1917
01:48:07,708 --> 01:48:11,208
Rambabu, Rambabu help me

1918
01:48:37,625 --> 01:48:41,125

Lalita?

1922
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,333
In those stormy Waves deep water flowing

1923
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:01,583
I was scared,

1924
01:49:02,083 --> 01:49:03,125
I think

1925
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,083
You will not be saved.

1926
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:10,166
If I would have died by drowning?

1927
01:49:10,666 --> 01:49:12,333
Who stays here alive?

1928
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:15,500
I would have died by drowning in the same Waves.

1929
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,500
Lalita Yes, now is sworn,

1930
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,416
You are alive, then I am.

01:49:24,916 --> 01:49:28,416
You do not, then I can not.

1932
01:49:28,916 --> 01:49:32,416
Rambabu

1933
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:02,125
I want to ask you one thing?

1934
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:03,500
What?

1935
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,500
Who is Gopi's father?

1936
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,041
Why not speak? why are you quiet?

1937
01:50:14,541 --> 01:50:17,583
This is not the time these things.

1938
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:19,875
If you will wait here for long

1939
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:26,166
in the minds of those who doubt the

1940
01:50:26,666 --> 01:50:28,500

02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,500
So Ram babu is the husband of Janaki Devi.

2236
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
That is my Sadu, When one a Sadu, is Rich

2237
02:07:56,500 --> 02:08:02,875
The second can turn the broom

2238
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:03,833
What is it?

2239
02:08:04,333 --> 02:08:05,333
What is it?

2240
02:08:05,833 --> 02:08:08,916
Oh my Gul kulcha, you, you are my earning spouse

2241
02:08:09,416 --> 02:08:12,291
I, over alcohol, I need the money.

2242
02:08:12,791 --> 02:08:13,833
Is the last day of the month,

2243
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:16,125
I have no money.

2244
02:08:16,625 --> 02:08:17,500
So what happened?

2245
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,958
You Sister a lot of money to do so,

2246
02:08:21,458 --> 02:08:22,500
sister?

2247
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,750
Demand for her and take

2248
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:28,750
How do you know, my sister,

2249
02:08:31,375 --> 02:08:32,708
I know everything.

2250
02:08:33,208 --> 02:08:34,500
I am a little bit punk,

2251
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,875
Many times I have been in prison

2252
02:08:36,375 --> 02:08:38,041
and came out of jail several times.

2253
02:08:38,541 --> 02:08:41,791
That's my job is to keep people

2254
02:08:42,291 --> 02:08:43,750
I know that your sister is here.

2255
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,500
Her husband is a lawyer and has a lot of money

2256
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,500
But you did not tell me yet?

2257
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Anyway, leave it,

2258
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:55,083
You, you go to your sister,

2259
02:08:55,583 --> 02:08:56,791
And bring me the money

2260
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:59,333
No

2261
02:08:59,833 --> 02:09:02,416
Are you or I go to your sister

2262
02:09:02,916 --> 02:09:08,958
No, not even my sister to run that,

2263
02:09:09,458 --> 02:09:10,250
for God's

2264
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:11,500
You do not go there.

2265
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,500
Why?

2266
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:23,500
Ram Babu knows that, Lalita is here,

2267
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,500
However, she should not know that her sister,

2268
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,500
But why?

2269
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:40,375
No, you're lying, it can never be.

2270
02:09:40,875 --> 02:09:44,375
I have these stupid things,

2271
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,291
Ram Kali, the personification of this

2272
02:09:52,791 --> 02:09:55,750
And that the worship of Ram Avatar also do

2273
02:09:56,250 --> 02:09:59,500
I understand my wife Devi

2274
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,166
and the Devi temple

2275
02:10:01,666 --> 02:10:02,333
which means that her home is here,

2276
02:10:02,833 --> 02:10:05,500
In the same city, you do not know

2277
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,250
No,

2278
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:13,666
I unite my heart, my sister

2279
02:10:14,166 --> 02:10:19,500
I do not want to meet me but

2280
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,166
You lie

2281
02:10:21,666 --> 02:10:22,291
go away from here,

2282
02:10:22,791 --> 02:10:24,500
No

2283
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,541
Your eyes to see, and so

2284
02:10:29,041 --> 02:10:29,791
So lets go my house

2285
02:10:30,291 --> 02:10:31,708
and see with your own eyes

2286
02:10:32,208 --> 02:10:37,375
Your god Ram And My Godesss

2287
02:10:37,875 --> 02:10:41,375
Come with me,

2288
02:10:44,708 --> 02:10:48,208
My God, it's not true, do lie out, God.

2289
02:10:58,708 --> 02:11:00,291
I can not afford that,

2290
02:11:00,791 --> 02:11:02,500
You live a life terrified with him

2291
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,833
Come on, you leave the house today.

2292
02:11:06,333 --> 02:11:09,083
No, do not rush,

2293
02:11:09,583 --> 02:11:11,875
Everything slowly comes automatically

2294
02:11:12,375 --> 02:11:16,333
itself in front of the world, the better

2295
02:11:16,833 --> 02:11:18,500
you have a request

2296
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,500
you did not come here every day

2297
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,500
Otherwise it would be wrong

2298
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,833
Sister finds out,

2299
02:11:25,333 --> 02:11:28,333
Your built home will be consumed

2300
02:11:28,833 --> 02:11:32,500
Well done, very good drama is going on

2301
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,500
Janaki, how come you here?

2302
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,500
Why, I came to become clogged in the

2303
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,250
I destroy to be here, ruined or environment?

2304
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:52,125
I just had to know the truth,

2305
02:11:52,625 --> 02:11:56,500
And it was known,

2306
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,500
I, I always thought your goodness

2307
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,791
Oh, God was worshiped

2308
02:12:04,291 --> 02:12:06,583
then never asked for anything

2309
02:12:07,083 --> 02:12:10,416
Just been praying for happiness

2310
02:12:10,916 --> 02:12:11,791
And instead of you

2311
02:12:12,291 --> 02:12:13,875
trying to ruin my own home continued,

2312
02:12:14,375 --> 02:12:16,375
My only demand is to devour dreaming

2313
02:12:16,875 --> 02:12:17,916
No Sister,

2314
02:12:18,416 --> 02:12:20,500
Beware ever told me sister,

2315
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,875
Shameless

2316
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:28,583
your tongue protruding from it was

2317
02:12:29,083 --> 02:12:29,250
And now

2318
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:32,750
now I have grown to hate this term.

2319
02:12:33,250 --> 02:12:35,500
While your husband is

2320
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,250
my husband wants to snatch the

2321
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:39,416
Enough, enough

2322
02:12:39,916 --> 02:12:41,500
you have to give a lot of abuses, to Lalita,

2323
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,500
You do not know your sister, Janki

2324
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:44,833
It is a goddess

2325
02:12:45,333 --> 02:12:48,958
who give you pleasure yourself

2326
02:12:49,458 --> 02:12:50,500
It has the gives you life

2327
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,375
which God did not want to give you.

2328
02:12:52,875 --> 02:12:54,500
How are Lalita

2329
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,541
To learn is very important to know the truth.

2330
02:12:57,041 --> 02:12:56,958
Lalita,

2331
02:12:57,458 --> 02:13:00,958
Rambabu,

2332
02:13:06,625 --> 02:13:07,875
What is the truth?

2333
02:13:08,375 --> 02:13:09,375

2334
02:13:09,875 --> 02:13:12,083

2335
02:13:12,583 --> 02:13:13,666

Shut up here to visit you everyday,

2337
02:13:16,541 --> 02:13:18,166

2338
02:13:18,666 --> 02:13:20,500
If you are raising a son

2339
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,541
And bringing our house kept lying to me,

2340
02:13:23,041 --> 02:13:24,500
The big businessman's son,

2341
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:25,958
it is the truth

2342
02:13:26,458 --> 02:13:27,541
And if it is false

2343
02:13:28,041 --> 02:13:30,000
then why not tell me till now?

2344
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:32,041
That she is here, in this city

2345
02:13:32,541 --> 02:13:34,416

2346
02:13:34,916 --> 02:13:35,500
Say, why be silent?

2347
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,416
Silent,

This time you will not understand.

2349
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:42,500
But one day come that

2350
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,250
Truth will automatically come to your self,

2351
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:48,500
And then you will repent on their behavior

2352
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:49,500
Come on, Let's go here,

02:19:05,875 --> 02:19:07,500
who had been impressed my mind

2411
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,041

I love her sank.

2413
02:19:13,458 --> 02:19:16,500
And after that I visited Lalita another,

2414
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,583
As my wife

2415
02:19:19,083 --> 02:19:21,500
went to a desolate world.

2416
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,083
I was outraged that,

2417
02:19:24,583 --> 02:19:26,500
And then

2418
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,833
I saw the true face of Lalita,

2419
02:19:30,333 --> 02:19:36,000
That Lalita, who lives quietly

2420
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:40,750
And who sacrificed herself for.

2421
02:19:41,250 --> 02:19:46,666
Then she appeared as a

2422
02:19:47,166 --> 02:19:49,500
and now,

2423
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,625
and now,

2424
02:19:52,125 --> 02:19:57,916
And now the same as Lalita who are

2425
02:19:58,416 --> 02:20:01,416
Who murdered her husband and

2426
02:20:01,916 --> 02:20:07,583
Standing in front of you in the

2427
02:20:08,083 --> 02:20:09,500
My death is waiting.

2428
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,791
Lalita No, I will not let you die.

2429
02:20:14,291 --> 02:20:17,208
I will fight your case,

2430
02:20:17,708 --> 02:20:19,500
You help me, just so,

2431
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,500
These two papers signed

2432
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,500
No Ram Babu,

2433
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,958
Now I do not want to live,

2434
02:20:27,458 --> 02:20:31,208
Because if I'm alive,

2435
02:20:31,708 --> 02:20:36,500
Then my Life set lamp will be fire to

2436
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:44,500
So let me hang,

2437
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,458
let me die.

2438
02:20:46,958 --> 02:20:49,458
If your life was extinguished lamp

2439
02:20:49,958 --> 02:20:53,458
So is the life and the darkness,

2440
02:20:53,958 --> 02:20:56,125
and he is your son, Gopi.

2441
02:20:56,625 --> 02:21:00,583
You have to live for him.

2442
02:21:01,083 --> 02:21:02,000
Right now I have it, but also get

2443
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:08,625
Asks the same question, where is

that she will never come

2446
02:21:13,291 --> 02:21:14,791
then what would become of him

2447
02:21:15,291 --> 02:21:18,791
he would be crazy,

2448
02:21:20,458 --> 02:21:21,500
Please do not be obstinate

02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:25,500
and sign two papers.

2450
02:21:34,541 --> 02:21:35,833

2460
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:15,250

I do not understand,

2497
02:24:36,083 --> 02:24:38,166
For all this only responsible of Lalita.

2498
02:24:38,666 --> 02:24:40,625
Truth is thst

2499
02:24:41,125 --> 02:24:43,875
Lalita burned her dreams

2500
02:24:44,375 --> 02:24:46,916
And she brought light into the world,

2501
02:24:47,416 --> 02:24:49,500
And you're saying the same Lalita vile,

2502
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,250
But first, know the truth

2503
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:57,125

Lalita has killed her husband,

2506
02:25:06,791 --> 02:25:07,750
But She,

2507
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:12,083
And to save her child's life, forcing

2508
02:25:12,583 --> 02:25:14,500
Therefore, in the eyes of the law

2509
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:15,500
not the murderer,

2510
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,083

Otherwise, life is what you are spending

2517

you would not even dream of luck

2518
02:25:40,833 --> 02:25:42,458
Before your marriage

2519
02:25:42,958 --> 02:25:45,625
Rama and Lalita loved each other,

2520
02:25:46,125 --> 02:25:47,708
Wanted to marry,

2521
02:25:48,208 --> 02:25:49,875

I do not deserve this

2605
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,041
But can you forgive me?

2606
02:31:26,541 --> 02:31:27,958
Sorry, for what?

2607
02:31:28,458 --> 02:31:30,833
Do not cry, do not talk.

2608
02:31:31,333 --> 02:31:34,458
No Lalita

2609
02:31:34,958 --> 02:31:37,541
I did not recognize my sister

2610
02:31:38,041 --> 02:31:40,500
She loved me

2611
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,500
and I doubt her

2612
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,916
Forgive me

2613
02:31:47,416 --> 02:31:48,458

2614
02:31:48,958 --> 02:31:52,458
Bring My child

2615
02:31:55,666 --> 02:31:59,166
Give to Lalita

2616
02:32:01,333 --> 02:32:03,416
Lalita

2617
02:32:03,916 --> 02:32:07,041
we have spent a childhood without a mother.

2618
02:32:07,541 --> 02:32:09,500
We know that

2619
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
do not mother's lap

2620
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:14,916
then fashioned childhood sun burns

2621
02:32:15,416 --> 02:32:17,125
I do not want that

2622
02:32:17,625 --> 02:32:20,500

2623
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,125
So again it's do not Happened,

2624
02:32:24,625 --> 02:32:29,500
Give my child the edge of the Support,

2625
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Understand that

2626
02:32:32,500 --> 02:32:35,666
it's not my,

2627
02:32:36,166 --> 02:32:41,791
To diverge from your sister,

2628
02:32:42,291 --> 02:32:46,750
Starting today, you're her mother,

2629
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:48,666
Yes Lalita

2630
02:32:49,166 --> 02:32:54,500

02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,375
Unneccesory I came in,

2632
02:32:57,875 --> 02:33:00,375
This story upset,

2633
02:33:00,875 --> 02:33:02,500
So

2634
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,375
So I am leaving in the middle of the story

2635
02:33:06,875 --> 02:33:08,375
But Lalita

2636
02:33:08,875 --> 02:33:14,708

2637
02:33:15,208 --> 02:33:16,958

02:33:22,125 --> 02:33:26,500
who is not widow

2640
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:30,500
So

2641
02:33:52,166 --> 02:33:53,625
So Lalita

2642
02:33:54,125 --> 02:33:59,500

What is the only wish

2648

I have thought that I leave this

2649
02:35:06,416 --> 02:35:09,916
We will meet again in the next birth,

2650
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,500
Thats a promise

2651
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:29,375
