1
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:42,196
At least you could have told me that
you wouldn't be having dinner!

2
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:50,204
How can one know about meetings
fixed at the last moment?

3
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,218
What happens during these
meetings and discussions?

4
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,216
Only talks, right'?

5
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:01,223
And that too on a subject that
has been discussed repeatedly!

6
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,229
Slowly!

7
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,240
If you aren't very tired"

8
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,243
"read this letter!

9
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,241
So that explains it! - It's a
very important letter, lnder!

10
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,250
Read it, please!

11
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,253
What must have been written is that..

12
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,270
"The job is gone, right'? Good!

13
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,274
Why should you be upset?

14
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:53,275
We'll have to vacate this flat in 3
months! Isn't that reason to be upset?

15
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:59,273
No! - After 3 months we will
once again be on the streets!

16
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,287
Maybe, that too isn't
a matter of concern!

17
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,291
Till when will this go on, lnder'?

18
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:10,295
From the time we've married,
wherever we've stayed"

19
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,299
...we had this perennial fear!
Where to, from here'?

20
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:21,295
In all these years, we don't even
have a house to call our own!

21
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:27,301
I promise, Pooja, very soon you'll
have a house of your choice..

22
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,310
...your very own house!

23
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,318
DreamsL. Dreams, once again, lnder'?

24
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,323
Pooja, whenever there's any
problem related to the house"

25
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,321
...you think that the world has ended!

26
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,329
Don't talk like lnder, Aparna!

27
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:47,328
You're my childhood friend, know very
well what a house means to me!

28
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,335
I've not been brought up in
the laps of luxury like you!

29
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,333
I'm an orphan! Stayed in an orphanage!

30
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:56,338
Since childhood all that
I've dreamt of is my own house.

31
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,345
After marrying lnder I thought
that he would fulfill my dream!

32
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,348
But, he can't work anywhere
for more than 6 months!

33
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,346
Keeps on picking up
fights all the time.

34
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,349
Due to this house problem I
haven't become a mother yet!

35
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,350
What'?

36
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:16,350
Listen. As long as you two love
each other, it doesn't matter!

37
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:25,359
Is my lunch ready?
- I'll just lay the table.

38
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,368
How's your cough?
- Better than before!

39
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:32,366
What's the matter, Pooja, you
look worried'? - Nothing!

40
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,376
She has to find a new
house in 3 months time!

41
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:40,382
In 3 months? Well, in 3 months
I'll find 300 houses for you!

42
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,388
I'm jealous of you! - Why'?

43
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,384
Why don't we trade places?
- Pooja, please agree!

44
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,399
Well, I'm not at home!

45
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,406
Hello, lnder, how are you'?

46
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:05,407
You have a long life!
We were talking about you.

47
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,413
No, actually I was defending you!

48
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:13,415
Yes, she's here. Well, you
don't trouble my friend!

49
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,422
Well, here, talk to her.

50
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:23,417
Tell. Yes" What'?

51
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,432
But how is this possible, lnder'?

52
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,436
But?" Where are you'?

53
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,440
Okay, I'm coming.

54
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:40,434
What's the matter, Pooja'? - We'll
have to vacate the house today!

55
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,451
Wh at n ow'?

56
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,456
Take this.

57
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,461
You think it's a joke, lnder'?

58
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,468
I feel that you're turning mad!

59
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,469
No place to stay and you're giving
me these books on interiors!

60
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,470
Who told you that there's no house?

61
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,472
There is a house! - lnder, please!

62
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:18,483
Your house!

63
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,534
You don't believe it, even now, right'?

64
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,539
Can you read English?

65
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,545
See this, what's written in it'?

66
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,590
Mad!

67
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:05,639
28 years!" After 28 years, my own
house..l just can't believe it!

68
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,656
Hey Pooja, have you gone mad'?

69
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,655
I havant gone mad! I can't
believe it as yet!

70
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,664
Tell me, how did you manage
to buy such a big flat'?

71
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,662
From where did you get so much money'?

72
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,664
Robbed the bank!

73
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,671
Tell me the truth!

74
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,669
This is a perfect example of
underestimating your own!

75
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:32,674
I'm your husband and that's why
you underestimated this genius"

76
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,675
...but the world spotted the
diamond among the stones!

77
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:35,676
What do you mean?

78
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,679
It means that I've got a partner!

79
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,687
He'll invest his money and
I'll use my brains!

80
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:46,688
We will be making films. We have
started our own film company too!

81
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,694
Henceforth I won't be
working for anybody else"

82
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,692
"but for my ownself!

83
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,706
This is for you!

84
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,711
Don't try to cut out on expenses
to furnish this house..

85
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,709
...no compromises, please!

86
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,716
Whatever you had wished for,
Make all your dreams come true!

87
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:20,714
And when I return" - Return!'?
Where are you going?

88
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,728
Goa! - Why?

89
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,733
I have to work on three
films out there.

90
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:34,728
Film star, Kavita is working
in one of the films!

91
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,737
When are you going? - Today!

92
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,744
No, not today!

93
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,739
To gain something, one has to
lose something too!

94
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,749
You wanted a house, right.
You've got it!

95
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,747
Now in the bargain you'll have to
stay away from me for a few days!

96
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,762
And then, you'd be involved
in doing up the house!

97
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,765
Curtains, beds, cupboards"
all these things won't give you..

98
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,763
"Any time to think about me!

99
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,762
Inder, the bedroom is small, but
I'll put up a very big bed!

100
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,776
The walls will be of cream color!

101
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,774
Curtains too of the same color!

102
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,776
How will a red carpet look'?

103
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,784
All the furniture would be of cane!

104
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,787
I'll put a lot of plants
all around the hall..

105
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,786
"As if the greenery from outside
has found it's way inside!

106
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:47,812
Is Mrs. Malhotra in'? - Yes, speaking.

107
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,810
Please hold. There's a call from Goa.

108
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:01,815
Pooja! How are you! - I'm fine,
when are you coming back?

109
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,820
May be tomorrow evening. What can
I do, Pooja, work isn't over!

110
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,835
Pooja, are you listening?

111
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,834
Inder, I was just having a dream!

112
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,842
Our child! Just like you!

113
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,846
Inder, you're alone there, right'?

114
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,841
Wh.. what do you mean? - I mean, is
there anybody else in the room'?

115
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,856
Yes" Me and my solitude!

116
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,852
Inder, is Harish there? - Who'?
- Harish! Your assistant.

117
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,861
No. Why'?

118
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,863
You tell him to get me some
plants from there.

119
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,870
I'll get them!

120
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:51,865
I'm hanging up. Bye Pooja! - Bye!
Don't forget to get my plants!

121
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,943
The water in the tub is
getting cold. You..

122
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:07,952
Inder.. lnder!

123
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,955
What will happen, Kavita'?

124
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:16,950
What will happen? - I don't know!
lnder, I love you!

125
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,997
You're stinking! Go and have a bath.

126
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,998
Go!

127
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:23,076
A forehead like yours" my eyes"

128
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:30,083
...your nose" and this, my nose!

129
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:44,098
My lips! Your skin color and mine!

130
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,112
That's some comparison!

131
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,116
Your brains and"

132
00:17:56,142 --> 00:18:01,114
...your hearL. just like you!

133
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,132
Inder, I want a child!

134
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,140
I wish we'd met earlier!

135
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,138
We would have been married by now!

136
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,147
And we would have had a lot of kids!

137
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,153
Inder, we'll have
our children, right'?

138
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,158
We'll have them, right'?

139
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,155
We'll have!

140
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:44,157
Hey.. how will we look
when we grow old'?

141
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:52,176
Kavita, how are you'? - lnder!

142
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,180
I'm very tired! - I'm tired too!

143
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,189
Hey.. madam is here!

144
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,184
The watchman informed that you
were on the lookout for a maid!

145
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,192
Come!

146
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,204
What work can you do'?

147
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:24,205
Utensils, clothes, sweeping
and swabbing. Anything!

148
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,211
I'm not afraid of work!

149
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,209
We're just two of us,
me and my husband!

150
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,216
There's work in the morning
for a couple of hours and"

151
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,214
...in the evening too for a
couple of hours. That's all!

152
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,223
There's house work in the
afternoon. will do!

153
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,224
What would be your salary?
- You tell me!

154
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,231
I'll give 5O now, will increase
it later on seeing your work.

155
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,235
Will do! - What's happened
to your eyes?

156
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,241
Husband beat me! - Why'?

157
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,244
From the time he's involved
with the other woman"

158
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,242
"creates some problem everyday!

159
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,241
Has he remarried? - Not married,
madam.. just kept her!

160
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,250
Had a good job in the municipality"

161
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,257
"lost that due to
his drinking habits!

162
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,255
I've been looking after the
house for the past one year!

163
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,263
Gives him money for his drinks too!
Beats me inspite of that!

164
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,258
How many children do
you have'? - Just this one!

165
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:30,263
Madam, she'll be with me..
won't trouble you!

166
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,280
I don't want to keep her
alone with my husband!

167
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:41,274
All right.. take your thumb out of
the mouth, you'll spoil your teeth!

168
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,284
No one would marry you then!

169
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,297
Let me have a drag!

170
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:02,295
Harish, these past few days, have
you met Pooja by any chance?

171
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,302
Inder, I'm your assistant! Just
come back from Goa alongwith you!

172
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,318
For the past few days, lying
for you, I've become an expert!

173
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:20,324
What's the harm if you lie for
your friend at some times?

174
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,322
Why do you feel so bad'?

175
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,324
Inder, I respect Pooja and
I don't like this relationship"

176
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,326
"that you share with Kavita!

177
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:36,329
Inder, what I fear is the day
when Pooja finds out the truth!

178
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,345
If I was in your place,
I'd have left him and gone!

179
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,343
How can you tolerate all this?

180
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,341
What'? Leave" that thought
never crossed my mind!

181
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,355
It's a bond for a lifetime!
Can't snap off just like that!

182
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:58,351
He beats me, thrashes me..l scream"
but he's my husband after all!

183
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,360
And that other woman, she's amazing!

184
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,362
Doesn't she know that
he's your husband?

185
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:07,368
She's aware of it, madam"
but she too has problems!

186
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:11,375
Last night, in a drunken state,
he beat her too! Beat her a lot!

187
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:17,370
That's our story! Work whole day
and then get beaten up at night!

188
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,384
Move aside!

189
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,387
I'm not afraid of work, madam!

190
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:27,388
My mom has been working alongwith
her mother since childhood!

191
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:32,385
And I've been working with
my mother since my childhood!

192
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,394
This has been going on!

193
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:39,392
But I've decided that my daughter
won't continue this tradition!

194
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:45,398
She'll study, go to an English
school" be like you!

195
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,417
Madam, you do me a favor!

196
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:57,418
You keep my salary in the
bank, in my daughter's name!

197
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,420
I've not told my husband
that I work over here.

198
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,427
He only knows about the other
two places that I work.

199
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,430
Will you do that for me'?

200
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:13,426
Well, will you go
to an English school!'?

201
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,440
Just find out who's come.
- I'll check up.

202
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,454
Shameless! - There's madam inside!

203
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,459
Who are you'? - I'm her husband!

204
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:41,454
This bitch lies to me,
lies to her husband!

205
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:45,469
Told me that she works
only at two places"

206
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:49,470
"and is the earnings of the third
house for some lover of yours?

207
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,474
You go inside.

208
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:55,476
Why have you come here'?
- I'm her husband, madam!

209
00:23:55,668 --> 00:24:00,481
So what? - What do you mean, this
bitch eats at three houses..

210
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,483
"And I'm hungry since
yesterday night!

211
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:06,486
Give me 1O rupees advance.
- I won't give you a single penny!

212
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,488
You go from here or
I'll call the watchman.

213
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,490
You go home, I'll come at night.

214
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,492
If you don't give the wife's
earnings to the husband"

215
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,494
...who would you give it to'?

216
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,496
Give me the money! - Are you
leaving or should I..

217
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,498
What would you do'?
- Hey, you leave!

218
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,500
What do you think?

219
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,502
Inder, see this man,
he's drunk and misbehaving.

220
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,504
Hey, what's happening? Who are you'?

221
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:28,509
Don't catch me, Sir, I'm
asking my wife for 1O rupees.

222
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,509
So what are you doing here'?

223
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,510
Inder, I'll take care of
him, you go in.

224
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,512
I didn't ask you for it!

225
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,513
Hey, you misbehave after
having a drink!

226
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,515
Don't touch me! - Will you
beat me'? - I can hit too!

227
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,517
Throw him down!

228
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,524
You move in, I'm coming.

229
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,527
Hey, you, take him away.

230
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,530
You come home.. - Yeah, I'm coming.

231
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,533
Get lost!

232
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,537
You go too! - Well.. she's innocent!

233
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,535
You shouldn't keep such
people in the house!

234
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,538
It was her husband who was drunk
and beating her up. You go in.

235
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,540
Scolding her for no reason!

236
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,547
Do you know, that lady he'd
come with, that's his mistress!

237
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,545
Inspite of her, she tolerates him!

238
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:08,552
If it was my husband, I would
have left him a long time back!

239
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:11,551
Let it be, Pooja. By the way
I should appreciate your taste!

240
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,553
You've done up the house
beautifully, isn't it, lnder'?

241
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,555
By the way, lnder, we'll
shoot our next film here!

242
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:17,557
Beware if you.. - I was joking!

243
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,559
Don't you ever think about it.

244
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,572
Some of your books are
still locked in the suitcase.

245
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,576
I'm leaving, Pooja.

246
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,574
Well, you just came and
are leaving so soon?

247
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,576
I've got a lot of work, Pooja.

248
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:37,577
Have to show the film
to the client tomorrow.

249
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,579
That's why I'll have to
work overtime tonight!

250
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,584
I've invited Anil and Aparna for
dinner! - Work has to be done!

251
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,585
How bad would they feel? They're
coming to our house for the first time"

252
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,587
"and you wouldn't be at home.

253
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:50,594
All right, I'll try to come early!

254
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,604
Inder, mom will be
very happy to see you!

255
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,614
Madam, talk to your mom!

256
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:17,610
Mom, hello mom, this is Kavita!

257
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,620
How are you'? I'm fine, how are you'?

258
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:26,619
Health? What?"
Pickle.. Yes I got it.

259
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,635
You listen to me first.

260
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,640
Listen, you used to pester
me to get married, right'?

261
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,638
I'm about to get married!

262
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,646
Yes! He's good, very good!

263
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:47,651
No, he's not an actor. She
thinks that you're an actor.

264
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:51,655
Not at all, well, you talk to him.

265
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,653
Talk to him at least!

266
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:54,654
Fast!

267
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,663
Greetings, mother!

268
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,667
Well, my name" didn't
even tell her my name?

269
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:04,664
Talk, please!

270
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:06,669
Well, lnder!

271
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,674
That's right! Why don't you come here'?

272
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:11,671
To meet Kavita.

273
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,673
What's left over there?

274
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:19,683
Well, she seems to be
very happy these days!

275
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,687
You don't worry, I'll take care of her!

276
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,691
I promise you that
I'll take care of Kavita.

277
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,696
Well, talk to Kavita.

278
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,702
No, I don't get scared now!

279
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:44,697
Being with lnder I feel just like I
used to feel when I was with dad!

280
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,711
You don't worry at all!

281
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:53,706
You come fast. come fast!

282
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,718
Mom?

283
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:14,738
What's the time'?

284
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:17,740
2:30!

285
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,742
I'm leaving! - Why'?
You leave at 4 everyday?

286
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,756
I'm very tired today!

287
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,754
And there's lots of work
in the morning too!

288
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,770
Won't you come with me to the door?

289
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,779
Seeing you go out of this house"

290
00:28:56,802 --> 00:29:00,773
...l feel scared of
the vaccum created!

291
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,796
Pooja has got a house now, right'?

292
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,801
You had told me that
whenever she gets a house"

293
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,799
...you'll stay here!

294
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,830
You must have not told
Pooja about me as yet!

295
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:50,834
And neither will you tell!

296
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,833
If, by tomorrow morning you
don't tell her about me..

297
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,840
...I'll call her up and tell her!

298
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:36,869
All the money is over and the middle
room still needs to be done up!

299
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,883
Your writing table itself
will cost Rs. 1000!

300
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,887
What are you thinking about?

301
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,897
I want to talk to you!

302
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:58,899
What'?.. What's the matter, lnder'?

303
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:05,898
Madam, I'll get the wheat flour.
The flour-mill will be closing!

304
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,924
What's the matter, lnder'?

305
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,923
Pooja, I was thinking of letting
the middle room be as it is.

306
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,930
For work, I have the office!

307
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,933
Was that all you
wanted to talk about?

308
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,931
Yes! Why'?

309
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,939
See this! How fast
my heart is beating?

310
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,937
I thought you'd tell
me something bad!

311
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,939
What bad things can
I talk to you about?

312
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,950
I can't understand.

313
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:52,956
But, Sir, I had informed
you about today's show!

314
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,954
Maybe you've forgotten!

315
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,957
Forgotten? So what" can't
I forget, that you remind me'?

316
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,966
Which movie are you
watching? - lnder's film.

317
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,969
That movie which stars Kavita Sanyal'?

318
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,983
Madam, don't go in, please!

319
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,031
Fantastic! Fantastic! Very good!

320
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:23,046
But.. where is the product?

321
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,049
Where is our product?
I want the product!

322
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:32,044
Dilip, this film has Kavita, who'll
remind the viewer of the product!

323
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:40,052
We have given Kavita Sanyal
80,000 rupees for this film..

324
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,067
"It's the costliest film in
the world of advertising!

325
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,062
But, we have made this film, not for
Kavita Sanyal but for our product!

326
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,072
Something which isn't there!
- Dilip, you don't understand!

327
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,070
Inder, this film publicises your
romance and not our product!

328
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,082
I invested for my product and
not for your extravagance!

329
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,110
Inder, you leave, you have my oath!

330
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,114
Harish, stop him!

331
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:37,109
Come on!

332
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,126
Bloody swine"

333
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,131
Madam, did you call me'?

334
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:53,125
Gulshan, call up at lnder's
place, I want to talk to Pooja.

335
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,131
Sorry, madam, I think" - Do exactly
as I tell you to! - Yes, madam.

336
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,171
Don't know who it was!

337
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:44,187
How is this nameplate of ours'?

338
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,191
Put it up!

339
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:52,195
Here! A bit here!

340
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,201
Not there!.. Just a nail here!

341
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:03,206
Why don't you take a leave for a
few days'? Anil was saying that if..

342
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:07,207
You could get a leave for a week,
all four of us could go to Goa.

343
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,213
Would be good for you!

344
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,212
I'm telling! I'm telling!
I'm telling! I'm telling!

345
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,231
Pooja, I love somebody else!

346
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,236
I love Kavita Sanyal!

347
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,240
Well, Pooja, please try to understand.

348
00:36:38,263 --> 00:36:42,234
Initially, we were very
good friends and then"

349
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:48,248
"what happened, how it happened,
nothing was in control!

350
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,257
It's necessary to tell you all this.

351
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,255
This is pricking my conscience!

352
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:00,263
Neither can I work, nor can I sleep"

353
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:04,267
"stay awake the whole night like mad!

354
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:09,269
I'll burst open.. I can't bear
it any more! Can't bear it!

355
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,385
Nothing!

356
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:40,423
Don't touch me!

357
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,455
Come! - Well, I just wanted a minute"

358
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,458
Come in, buddie.. come in!

359
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:20,452
Sit. What is it, you look worried!

360
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:23,466
Madam walked out of the shooting.

361
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,465
"Seemed very scared
after talking to you!

362
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:32,464
So what's new'? it happens
all the time! You know it!

363
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,478
Where is she now'?

364
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:39,478
Down in the car. Wants to
see you for a minute.

365
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,501
I'll just be back.

366
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:41,534
Where have you been'? - Aparna,
you come over immediately.

367
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:45,548
This very moment! - What's
the matter, Pooja'?

368
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:51,543
You come over, I'll tell you!

369
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,560
Yes, I'm coming.

370
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:16,568
I can't believe it!
Can lnder do that'?

371
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,584
Nothing's gonna happen if
you take things lightly!

372
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,587
Pack up your belongings
and move out with us.

373
00:42:24,776 --> 00:42:25,584
He'll come to his senses
in a couple of days.

374
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,586
"Then he'll come searching for you!

375
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,588
No, Aparna, she shouldn't
do that! - Why'?

376
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,590
Because this is her own house!

377
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,597
That's why she shouldn't do it!

378
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:40,592
Pooja, these relations
don't last long!

379
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,606
Give lnder some time!

380
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,610
I'm sure.. he'll
come to his senses!

381
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:50,613
And he'll come back home!

382
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:55,618
He.. will he come back?

383
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,624
Pooja, the walls of the
house aren't so brittle..

384
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:04,627
"They don't break so easily!

385
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,630
This relationship between the
two of you is seven years old!

386
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,634
Have faith!

387
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:17,629
But Anil, I can't leave
Pooja alone like this!

388
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,644
Madam, I'll stay with her!

389
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:31,653
I'll leave!

390
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:35,655
Inder, please, let me apply the
medicine, you may leave after that.

391
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:44,657
What's happened to me'? it's just
a minor cut! You're simply"

392
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:48,671
You have my oath, please"

393
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,677
Take, do whatever you want to do!

394
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:28,711
Do you want anything, madam?

395
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,713
Did the doorbell ring'? - No!

396
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,731
Does she suck her
thumb in her sleep too'?

397
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:55,738
Don't worry madam, God will
take care of everything!

398
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:01,744
Go to sleep!

399
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,751
Get up! It's 4!

400
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,761
No, PoojaL. No, no Pooja!

401
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:46,122
Inder, you go.. you 9°-

402
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,125
In spite of being with me,
you were with your wife!

403
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,123
Only your body was lying over here!

404
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:57,122
I don't want it! I don't
want your body alone!

405
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,130
You go!

406
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:31,156
This two-faceted life!
No! Not any more!

407
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:41,166
Kavita, I'll stay here.. with you!

408
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,180
Maybe, this decision"

409
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,178
...would be best for all of us!

410
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:39,235
Take me to Kavita SanyaPs house.

411
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,238
I want to meet lnder!

412
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,242
You too, kept this fact
hidden from me! You too!

413
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,249
Shall we go'?

414
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,254
Pooja, why do you want
to affront yourself?

415
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:03,258
You stay here, I'll call lnder.

416
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,259
I don't want your false sympathies!
I want to meet my husband!

417
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:25,281
I was trying to tell you
right from the beginning..

418
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,278
...only if you had listened to me..

419
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,286
I feared this day,
lnder.. this very day!

420
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,289
Where's Pooja'?

421
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,287
Outside in the taxi!

422
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,307
What hae you done'?
Why did you get her here'?

423
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:55,307
What else could I do'? Have
you seen her state? She"

424
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,313
She would have come up!

425
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,312
What do you expect of me'?
What can I do'?

426
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,314
Inder, get over this
madness and come home!

427
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,316
Please, it's too much!

428
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,330
No, Harish, I've made a decision!

429
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,334
You go and tell Pooja
about your decision!

430
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:30,335
Harish, take Pooja to the office.
I'm coming there. Please!

431
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,370
Harish, Dilip will be coming.
Discuss it out with him.

432
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,368
These daily nuances should be over!

433
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:11,376
What was my fault,
lnder'? Where did I err'?

434
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:17,381
I had never thought that one
fine day you'd stop loving me!

435
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,398
I've not stopped loving you, Pooja..

436
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,402
...the only difference is
that I love Kavita too!

437
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:36,401
Suddenly I felt as if I was
back to the orphanage!

438
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,414
I'm feeling very scared, lnder!

439
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,411
Pooja, you're not alone,
I'm with you!

440
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,427
You have a house,
money in the bank"

441
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,422
"and then we' re still
friends and will be, always!

442
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:01,437
Inspite of Kavita our
friendship won't suffer!

443
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:12,437
Inder, forget whatever
has happened!

444
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:17,442
Let's go away from
here, somewhere far"

445
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,453
"start our life in a new way!

446
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,460
Whatever I lacked in,
whatever my drawbacks"

447
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:28,464
...I'll try to eliminate them!

448
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,466
Give me one more chance, lnder!

449
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:39,463
No, Pooja, I've made up my mind.

450
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:47,471
I'll stay with Kavita. That
would be ideal for all of us!

451
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,516
Kavita, this is Pooja.

452
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,521
Don't hang up.

453
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,524
I want to talk to you!

454
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,531
Don't tell lnder that I'd called up.

455
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:42,527
You're listening, aren't you'?
- Yes, go ahead.

456
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:50,534
Well, you're a woman, would
understand what I've to say!

457
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:59,544
Kavita, I'm all alone.

458
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:07,551
Other than lnder,
I don't have anybody.

459
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,561
You' re listening, right'?

460
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:19,565
Kavita, please, don't
snatch my lnder from me..

461
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:25,569
"Without him, what will
I do, where will I go'?

462
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,584
You're listening, aren't you'?

463
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:41,586
Kavita, I beg of you,
please leave lnder for me!

464
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,591
He's all that I have.
Without him I'll..

465
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:06,611
It's been 2 weeks, lnder hasn't
come home, hasn't phoned up too..

466
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:10,625
...l feel very lonely!

467
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,629
Pooja don't brood over it so much!

468
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:17,632
You should be relaxed sometimes"

469
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:23,628
"living like this, all hassled
you'll..- I've tried a lot but..

470
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,636
"Nothing is in my control!

471
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,644
Pooja, it's impossible to try within
the confines of that house..

472
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:32,648
"Everything in that house
will remind you of lnder!

473
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:38,643
Why don't you decide to go out
for a few days, meet new people!

474
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:41,657
Try to be cheerful!

475
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,655
That's right, Pooja. We've an
invitation to a party tonight..

476
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,657
...there'll be very good
people out there too..

477
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,659
...will be some change for you.

478
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:52,664
No, Aparna. - Yes, Pooja,
you're going for this party!

479
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:57,669
That's decided. What you
do is, go home by our car..

480
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,670
"Have a change of dress
and reach the party.

481
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,677
We have to go to the
airport to receive someone"

482
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,675
...will come over for
the party from there.

483
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,683
Yes, Pooja!

484
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,689
Where have we met before?

485
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,693
As a matter of fact,
we've never met before!

486
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,697
Aparna and Anil..
Mr. and Mrs. Mehra have"

487
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,701
So, you're Mrs. Pooja Malhotra!

488
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:28,704
Mrs. Mehra just called,
should be here any moment.

489
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:45,721
Have you come alone? Where's lnder'?

490
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,725
Inder is busy with some editing!

491
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,731
Come, have a seat!

492
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:02,726
She's lnder Malhotrds wife, one
who's having an affair with Kavita!

493
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,736
Yes, the same guy's wife!

494
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,751
If you're tired, you may stop
smiling" anyway no one is watching!

495
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:33,757
Discard this smile from your face to
find out the relief that you get!

496
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:39,775
My name is Raj" and what's yours?

497
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:55,779
Poojaji, I've a problem..

498
00:56:56,814 --> 00:57:00,785
...do you think all these people
would appreciate my 'ghazal"?

499
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,791
I'm a professional singer"
don't believe it, right'?

500
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:12,796
Poojaji, an artist has to
struggle a lot in life!

501
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:19,811
A talented singer like me has to
sing at such places!" for money!

502
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,817
Yesterday, I sang at
a tonsure ceremony!

503
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:39,834
Poojaji, if I don't
raise this hand"

504
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,833
"can this blemish in
my dress be seen?

505
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,849
Well, drinks would be
after the song, all right'?

506
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:10,045
That was fantastic!

507
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:13,048
Come on, I'll introduce
you to Kavita!

508
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:17,051
You sang very well!

509
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,061
Hello, you sing well!

510
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:31,066
What happened?

511
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,076
How did you like the tune'?

512
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:53,088
Can't you even face me'?

513
01:01:55,112 --> 01:02:01,085
When you have the courage to
brazenly walk into a crowded..

514
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:05,096
"Gathering, hand in hand
with your mistress"

515
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:11,094
...you should also have a little
courage to say hello to your wife!

516
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,109
Why did you run away after seeing me'?

517
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:29,113
My name is Pooja Malhotra..
Mrs. Pooja Malhotra!

518
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:33,128
The wife of your lover!

519
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:37,132
Please, I'll come to meet you!

520
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:47,130
Inder, what is it that
Kavita has that I lack?"

521
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:52,147
"that you were forced to desert me!

522
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:59,143
Yes, there is.. Kavita, you
do have something special!

523
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,157
According to our preachings, a wife,
while serving her husband"

524
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,155
"has to sometimes assume
the role of a mother"

525
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,163
"sometimes that of a sister"

526
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:11,166
"and in bed, has to assume
the role of a prostitute.

527
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,163
"Something that she's
taking care of!

528
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,171
Give me one more chance, lnder,
I'll try to make up for that too!

529
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:23,167
Why are you running away?
Why don't you face the truth?

530
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,187
These things do happen.

531
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,184
Please leave her alone!

532
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:35,185
Please leave her alone!

533
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,187
You go and sing!

534
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,195
I told you to leave her alone.

535
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,192
You raise your hand on me.. you swine!

536
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,201
Leave me.. I'll take care of him..

537
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,224
I'm all right now, thank you!

538
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:43,258
Left me..

539
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:51,266
In bed, has to assume
the role of a prostitute"

540
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,263
"something that she's
taking care of!

541
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:57,268
In bed, has to assume
the role of a prostitute"

542
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,269
"something that she's
taking care of!

543
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,294
What happened to you'?

544
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,297
Who are you calling up'?

545
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:29,292
Doctor, this is Kavita. - Yes,
Kavita, what's the matter?

546
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:34,298
I'm feeling scared, once
again. I feel very scared.

547
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,312
Who are you afraid of'?

548
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,310
Who are you afraid of'? Tell me!
- I'm afraid of myself"

549
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:45,308
...of everybody, I'm afraid
of everything!

550
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,316
Where's lnder'?

551
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:49,319
Inder can't do anything!
He himself is scared.

552
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,322
You come over please! - Kavita,
what has happened to you'?

553
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,329
Kavita, give the phone to lnder.

554
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,327
You come over, please.

555
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,330
Inder, this is Dr. Puri.
Give Kavita two sleeping pills.

556
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:11,346
Not more than that, it could be fatal.

557
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:17,340
And.. don't leave her alone at all!
I'll be there as soon as possible.

558
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:31,365
Kavita, take this, have these pills.

559
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:36,371
Sit while I get the water.

560
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,377
In bed, has to assume
the role of a prostitute"

561
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,374
"something that she's taking care of!

562
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,379
In bed, has to assume
the role of a prostitute"

563
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:52,384
"something that she's taking care of!

564
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:20,403
Kavita, what's this madness!

565
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:24,419
Spit them out!

566
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,428
Kavita, stop this madness!

567
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,461
Last night, due to your
disgusting behaviour"

568
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:08,458
...do you know what happened?

569
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:12,464
Kavita.. that poor girl
tried to commit suicide!

570
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:19,463
If anything had happened to Kavita,
I would have never forgiven you!

571
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:22,476
Wouldn't have looked at your face!

572
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,480
What is her fault in this?

573
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:30,481
Just that she loves me..
much more than you!

574
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:33,488
If, by mistake I've married you,
it doesn't mean that you..

575
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,485
...go around insulting Kavita!

576
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,486
That would be enough!

577
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,489
Don't mention your mistress
repeatedly in my presence!

578
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,497
This is my house. At least
respect my house!

579
01:08:44,521 --> 01:08:47,502
House! Your house!

580
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,505
Do you want to know the truth?

581
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:56,499
The house that you call your
own, is due to Kavita!

582
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:02,506
These things, all of them,
are all due to her.

583
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,520
The very Kavita whose name
you don't want to hear"

584
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,517
...all this has happened
with her money!

585
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,519
Feel like listening
to something more'?

586
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,521
That's a lie.. a lie..

587
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:15,530
Sir,

588
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,538
Don't ever try to meet me again"

589
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:30,533
"and if you need money,
send a message through Harish.

590
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:52,566
Come on, we' re going..
- ls this any time to go'?

591
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:59,573
What' s the matter?

592
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:01,571
Madam has given this!

593
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:18,582
Inder, I apologize for
whatever happened yesterday.

594
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:21,596
Something like this never
happened in 7 years.

595
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:25,600
I can't understand how
I stooped so low.

596
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:29,604
I'm sending the chequebook, the
keys and whatever cash I had.

597
01:10:31,628 --> 01:10:35,599
Your Kavita wants to have a
clear conscience by favoring me..

598
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,608
"But I'll not give her that chance.

599
01:10:38,635 --> 01:10:40,615
Let her live with that guilt.

600
01:10:41,638 --> 01:10:44,619
The 2000 rupees that were in
the account before our marriage"

601
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:46,450
...I've kept that.

602
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,452
I'm going.

603
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:50,454
Will try to live a respectful life!

604
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:55,452
I'm going from your Kavita's
house" not from your life!

605
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:59,467
Living away from you.. that's
something I've never learnt!

606
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,470
As and when you feel
that you need me..

607
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:06,471
...I'm there! Will be
always there. Pooja!

608
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,481
Tell your madam to
stop this nonsense.

609
01:11:14,504 --> 01:11:16,484
A lone woman doesn't get
shelter so easily in this world!

610
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,488
Sir, madam wouldn't come
to that house now!

611
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,493
All right, you go!

612
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,500
What type of a woman are you'?

613
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:35,499
Steal the house, the
clothes or the food"

614
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:36,500
"but why do you steal the man.

615
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:37,501
Beware of what you speak!

616
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:41,506
God will never forgive you!

617
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:49,506
Over here, only those girls get
accomodation who are into service!

618
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:52,515
Do you work'? - Yes, I do!

619
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:56,524
Do you have any certificate or
your company's appointment letter?

620
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:01,518
Well, I don't have
it right now, but..

621
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:04,532
No problem, you may give
it in a couple of days.

622
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,539
Write your name and
sign over here.

623
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,546
Are you Pooja Malhotra'? - Yes!

624
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,543
Well, I don't like
this at all'? - What'?

625
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,552
Don't leave your suitcase
open in the room..

626
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,551
You may say that your bra is robbed
or that your pantie is robbed..

627
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:29,553
...or that your costly saree is
robbed and then you'll blame me.

628
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,551
If you want to stay in my room,
learn to keep everything locked..

629
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:36,560
"The way I keep it, do
you understand? - Yes!

630
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,571
Brinjal vegetable once again
today! Eeks, who wants it'?

631
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,569
Who's Pooja Malhotra'?

632
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:47,574
Yes!

633
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:50,578
You work, right'? - Yes!

634
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,581
So, why haven't you given
the certificate till now'?

635
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:57,585
I should get the
certificate by tomorrow.

636
01:12:57,774 --> 01:12:59,583
Or else you will be expelled.

637
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:01,588
Mrs. Bhalla! - Yes!

638
01:13:01,778 --> 01:13:03,587
You shouldn't be giving
rooms to anyone like this!

639
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,589
This is against the rules.
I need her certificate by tomorrow.

640
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,596
All right!

641
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:16,593
You don't have a job, right'?

642
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:21,609
I have! - You're lying!

643
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:23,607
I'm telling you the truth!

644
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,609
No, you don't work. I know it!

645
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:30,618
Don't be afraid. I won't rat on you!

646
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:37,614
Fact of the matter is that..
even I don't work!

647
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:40,624
But I had given the
appointment letter!

648
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:43,631
HOW!

649
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:49,634
I have a lot of rich friends,
one of them gave me a letter.

650
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,640
Tonight, I'm going to meet him.

651
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:56,641
If you wish, I can talk to
him about a job for you.

652
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:03,640
Now tell me the truth, is
there, or isn't there a job'?

653
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:09,657
Well, get ready. The job
will be taken care of.

654
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:15,652
5.. 6.. 7..

655
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:22,659
8.. 9.. 10..

656
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:27,664
Open your eyes! - You're so good!

657
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,679
And this!

658
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:39,687
Did you see that.
He's not stingy like you.

659
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,686
I asked you for your Walkman for
some time and you didn't give.

660
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:48,685
The day you fulfil my wishes,
whatever you want.

661
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,694
...you'll get all of it
without even asking for it!

662
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,710
Can you arrange for a job
for my friend Pooja'?

663
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:04,708
She's quite upset!

664
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:08,716
She's told the hostel people that
she's working but she isn't!

665
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,719
At least arrange for an
appointment letter from somewhere.

666
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,722
Yes, sure, why not! I'll arrange
for it tomorrow itself.

667
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:25,722
I'll go and get the cigarettes.
Can I take your vehicle'? - Why not'?

668
01:15:26,756 --> 01:15:28,736
Come, I'll take you for a ride!
- No, I won't come.

669
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:35,732
You want the Walkman, right'? Come!

670
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:41,749
Pooja, we' re just coming.

671
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,747
You may discuss things with
him in the meantime.

672
01:16:05,795 --> 01:16:10,767
You'll get the letter" by the way,
what type of a job do you want'?

673
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,781
Something in the office!

674
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:25,793
Leave me!

675
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,837
You're awake'?

676
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:14,831
How was your meetiing'?
ls the job taken care of'?

677
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:19,847
What do you think I'm'? Am
I something that can be bought?

678
01:17:20,036 --> 01:17:21,845
Something for the purpose
of an exhibition?

679
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:26,843
What do you think? I thought
you were a good girl!

680
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:29,853
That you wanted to help me..

681
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:35,852
"But you're a dirty and sick woman
and consider others to be the same!

682
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:37,861
How dare you took me over there?

683
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,868
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

684
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:46,863
How pure you try to be'?
You feel great, right'?

685
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:48,872
You consider yourself
to be great, right'?

686
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,880
By calling me bad you
consider yourself good!

687
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:55,883
But how did you get the
right to call me bad'?

688
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:58,882
You didn't do me a favor
by coming with me.

689
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,889
I went out of the way
because you needed it.

690
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,888
If you can't take care of
yourself, why blame me'?

691
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:07,895
It's not as if some major
calamity has befallen you!

692
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,893
What must he have done'?
Must have wanted to kiss you!

693
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:11,895
Must have asked you
to sleep with him!

694
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:15,900
So, what's the big deal?
Nothing comes free in this world!

695
01:18:16,926 --> 01:18:20,897
Be it desire or need, to get
something you have to lose something!

696
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:24,912
And then, what do we women
have besides our body to offer'?

697
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:27,915
Even in a pure relation like
marriage, what is in it'?

698
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:30,918
The same give and take business!

699
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:34,919
The day the husband is tired of the
same old skin, he stops giving!

700
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:37,925
Goes far away in search of a new body!

701
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:42,919
Who else would know this better
than you, Mrs. Pooja Malhotra'?

702
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:04,952
Give me some more jam.
Will you give me so little?

703
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,968
Last night, when I was
in bed with Uday..

704
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:23,971
Please, I don't want to
know about your nights.

705
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:27,972
Well, listen. Last night,
when I was in bed with Uday..

706
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:33,970
...he spoke about a girl he
had bedded many times.

707
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:36,984
She is a receptionist
in a record company.

708
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,987
She's going to Australia.

709
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,991
Before the company guys release
an ad in the papers"

710
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,989
...why don't you go and try'?

711
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:56,003
Don't think that I'm staying
idle and giving you this job.

712
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:59,006
I'm not so great!

713
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:06,002
9 to 6 every day, 6 days a
week and just 900 Rs]?

714
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:13,020
I want a lot more from life!

715
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:18,014
And to get this lot more..
I'm ready to give a lot more!

716
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:26,033
This is the address of
the record company.

717
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:35,042
Go, try for the job.

718
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:40,036
This is my first class pass,
your money will be saved!

719
01:21:02,091 --> 01:21:05,072
Others may not meet
but we will meeL.

720
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,070
"Maybe that's what is
written in our destiny!

721
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:11,078
Have you come for an interview?

722
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,076
I have an audition here.

723
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,083
How are you'?

724
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:20,087
You're smiling again!

725
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,090
I'm sorry for the scene
I made the other night!

726
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,087
No need to be sorry.

727
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:28,091
Whatever you did the other night
requires lots of guts!

728
01:21:28,284 --> 01:21:32,096
I was floored! Really!

729
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:38,094
By the way, you owe me
Rs. 11.40 - What'?

730
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:41,108
That's because I had to
reach you home that night".

731
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:43,106
"Had to take a cab.

732
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:50,117
Instead of paying back the
money and repaying me..

733
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:52,115
...why don't you treat me for lunch'?

734
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:54,117
That's if you get a job!

735
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:06,133
I'll be waiting outside
for you after the interview.

736
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:13,140
Is it Miss or Mrs.
- I beg your pardon!

737
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:16,143
I mean, are you married?

738
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:25,152
We don't hire married woman for
the job of a receptionist over here.

739
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:29,156
One who is a wife today would
be a mother in the future!

740
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:32,155
We don't have provision
for maternity leave.

741
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:37,164
But Sir, I promise you that
nothing of the sorL.

742
01:22:37,353 --> 01:22:39,162
How can you guarantee that'?

743
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:49,176
One look at you tells me
that there's no lunch for me!

744
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,180
These unmelodious chaps failed
me in the audition too!

745
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:57,181
Didn't like my songs! Ignorant
lot! All of them!

746
01:22:58,207 --> 01:23:04,180
But, Pooja, there's no law that says
that one can't celebrate defeat!

747
01:23:05,214 --> 01:23:07,194
I'll treat you to lunch! - No, I..

748
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:12,199
Come along, my house is nearby.

749
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:20,207
You must be wondering as to
how a person like me..

750
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:22,205
"Can afford a house like this!

751
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:27,214
As a matter of fact,
this house doesn't belong to me.

752
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:30,213
It belongs to Pestonji Ghodewala!
- Who's he'?

753
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:34,218
A person whose first love is
racing and second love is music!

754
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:38,225
What an amazing combination!
He's the owner of 6O horses!

755
01:23:38,414 --> 01:23:40,223
This is your grand lunch!

756
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:47,223
Once at a party, at the request
of some drunkards, I sang"

757
01:23:47,423 --> 01:23:51,235
...he happened to be there,
went crazy over my voice..

758
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:57,241
...he was drunk and getting emotional
handed over the house keys.

759
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:01,248
But I've heard that this would
be broken down to make way"

760
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:03,246
...for stables for the horses.

761
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:08,255
Eat it!.. I'll be homeless very soon!

762
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:12,259
What are you thinking about?

763
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:17,253
I was thinking about where I would
go tonight after leaving the hostel.

764
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:23,259
You have a house, right'?
- I had a house! Don't have now!

765
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:25,268
That's funny. You had a house
which you don't have now..

766
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:27,270
"And I have one which I wouldn't
be having in the future!

767
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:29,272
Our problems are so similar!

768
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:34,281
Eat it!

769
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:42,289
So you want an appointment letter?
- Yes!

770
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:44,287
Today itself? - Yes!

771
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:48,295
You have your coffee. I'll be
back in 2O minutes and 13 seconds.

772
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:51,294
But where are you going?
- To solve your problem.

773
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:57,293
But how can I give this fake
appointment letter to them?

774
01:24:58,327 --> 01:25:01,308
Besides us, who else knows
that this letter is fake'?

775
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:06,310
But this is illegal!
- A lie which helps someone isn't a lie..

776
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:08,311
"And neither is it illegal!

777
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:13,309
Think of a nice name!
- What'? - Name!

778
01:25:13,509 --> 01:25:17,321
What could be the name of your boss'?

779
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:20,327
I can't think of anything!

780
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,343
Take this!

781
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:41,348
You won't agree!

782
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,355
This is really illegal!

783
01:25:48,544 --> 01:25:50,353
If it is illegal,
I will be handcuffed, not you!

784
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,360
Shall we go'? I have to
return this typewriter!

785
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,366
One more drink!

786
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:03,370
Well, it's your birthday today,
it's not everyday that"

787
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:10,366
How was the party, lnder'?
- Good! Very good!

788
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:15,371
We were five of us.
Today is Harish's birthday!

789
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:24,391
How is Pooja, lnder'?

790
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:37,394
Who'? - Your wife, Pooja!
Wasn't she at the party'?

791
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:45,402
Do you think that all the time
that I'm out of this house I'm with Pooja'?

792
01:26:47,436 --> 01:26:50,417
What has happened to you'?
Ask Harish if you want.

793
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,412
Why should I ask him'? He would be
very happy if you go back to Pooja!

794
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:10,426
That's some style of
dealing with guests!

795
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:17,433
I should thank you for affronting
my friend! Thanks a lot!

796
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:31,448
You're sick and slowly but
surely you're turning mad!

797
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:34,461
You've gone mad!

798
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:53,469
You're right lnder, I've gone mad!

799
01:27:53,669 --> 01:27:55,478
Do you know why'?
That's because inspite of being mine..

800
01:27:55,671 --> 01:27:57,480
...you don't belong to me!

801
01:27:57,506 --> 01:27:59,315
Inspite of leaving Pooja,
you haven't left her!

802
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:01,317
No, Kavita, that's not the truth!

803
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:04,324
That's a fact, lnder!

804
01:28:04,513 --> 01:28:06,322
That's why you haven't
divorced her yet!

805
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:09,329
Neither will you marry me
nor will you divorce her!

806
01:28:10,352 --> 01:28:12,332
This is a game you're playing lnder!

807
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:15,335
Inspite of staying in this house,
you'd leave the doors of that..

808
01:28:15,524 --> 01:28:17,333
"House open for you!

809
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:20,336
So that when you're through with
me you can go back to that house!

810
01:28:21,363 --> 01:28:29,339
Kavita, you know very well
that I haven't come here to return!

811
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:33,350
No, lnder! - Yes" Yes, Kavita!

812
01:28:34,376 --> 01:28:37,357
So divorce her.
Divorce her and marry me!

813
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:42,351
Marry me!..
Marry me!.. Marry me!

814
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,360
I'll do that!

815
01:28:50,392 --> 01:28:53,373
Pooja, what was it
in the morning? - What'?

816
01:28:54,396 --> 01:28:56,376
Didn't you see'?
- What didn't I see'?

817
01:28:57,399 --> 01:28:59,379
What time did you get up'?
- 7 o'clock! Why'?

818
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:03,383
That's the reason why
you didn't see it!

819
01:29:03,572 --> 01:29:05,381
What didn't I see'?

820
01:29:05,574 --> 01:29:07,383
Pooja, this morning I
accidentally got up at 6..

821
01:29:07,576 --> 01:29:09,385
...l saw that there was a lot of
light in the room, I was afraid"

822
01:29:10,412 --> 01:29:13,393
...l opened the window and saw
that a big sun was shining"

823
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:15,391
...opened the other window and
saw that there was another sun"

824
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,393
...when I opened the door,
there was a third sun.

825
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,400
Why were there three suns
in the sky today?

826
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:25,394
Why'? - That's because today's
18th September! Your birthday!

827
01:29:26,428 --> 01:29:29,409
How did you know'?
- ls the answer yes or no'?

828
01:29:30,432 --> 01:29:32,412
But, how did you know'?
- Tell me, yes or no!

829
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:37,417
Yes, but who told you'?

830
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:41,421
The other day when you
were filling up the form..

831
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:43,419
I read your birthdate.

832
01:29:52,454 --> 01:29:57,426
Well, Pooja, we get very less
opportunities to smile in life!

833
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:05,434
This life is full of tears,
sorrows and sadness!

834
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:09,449
That's why, whenever one
gets a chance to be cheerful"

835
01:30:10,472 --> 01:30:14,443
...one should make the most of it,
laugh to his heart's content!

836
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:19,459
What do you want'?

837
01:30:19,648 --> 01:30:23,460
I'd like to celebrate your birthday
at my place, at my cost!

838
01:30:24,486 --> 01:30:26,466
So if you could come at around 7..

839
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:32,461
No! - At 7.30! - No!

840
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:38,478
8 o'clock!

841
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,522
How are you'?

842
01:31:23,545 --> 01:31:27,516
Fine! How are you'?

843
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:30,530
I'm fine!

844
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:34,533
Sit!

845
01:31:42,564 --> 01:31:44,544
How come you came'?

846
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,549
Kavit isn't well! - Who'?

847
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:53,552
Kavita!

848
01:31:56,578 --> 01:31:58,558
What happened?

849
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:02,562
She's afraid that..

850
01:32:05,587 --> 01:32:10,559
She thinks that once I leave
the house, I wouldn't return!

851
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:15,575
Her insecurity is the
cause of her sickness!

852
01:32:17,599 --> 01:32:19,579
She thinks that
when I'm not with her..

853
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:23,583
...I'm with you!

854
01:32:25,607 --> 01:32:27,587
With me'?

855
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,586
Acts like a child!

856
01:32:33,615 --> 01:32:35,595
She's sick!

857
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:39,599
What do you want from me'?

858
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:46,606
What is this?

859
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:48,604
Request for a divorce!

860
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:54,603
This is just an excuse to
allay Kavita's fears!

861
01:32:54,803 --> 01:32:57,613
She'll feel relieved when
she sees your signatures on these.

862
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:02,611
She's very sad, sick.

863
01:33:02,811 --> 01:33:06,623
This is just a game,
a pretence put on for Kavita..

864
01:33:06,815 --> 01:33:08,624
...believe me there's
nothing between us thaL.

865
01:33:08,817 --> 01:33:10,626
Where should I sign?

866
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,640
Here!

867
01:33:29,671 --> 01:33:34,643
Will the signature be in the
name of Mrs. Pooja Malhotra'?

868
01:33:36,678 --> 01:33:41,650
Yes! The date would be 18th September!

869
01:33:44,686 --> 01:33:50,659
18th September?
- It's 18th September, right'?

870
01:34:03,705 --> 01:34:05,685
Your COPY!

871
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:24,693
Your house is as it is!
If you.. - If I..

872
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:29,709
If you need money..

873
01:34:40,742 --> 01:34:45,714
Poor Kavita! Wants to be tied to
you by the holy sacrament of matrimony"

874
01:34:46,748 --> 01:34:48,728
...which can be broken
by a mere signature!

875
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:47,086
Pooja, I want to tell you something!

876
01:40:53,114 --> 01:40:55,094
There's not much of a change, Pooja!

877
01:40:56,117 --> 01:40:58,097
Just by striking off Malhotra
from the name Pooja Malhotra..

878
01:40:58,286 --> 01:41:00,095
...Pooja isn't incomplete!

879
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,097
She is complete by herself!

880
01:41:03,124 --> 01:41:05,104
That's the real Pooja!

881
01:41:05,293 --> 01:41:07,102
That real Pooja is born today!

882
01:41:08,129 --> 01:41:11,110
In future, Pooja will
be standing on her own feet!

883
01:41:12,133 --> 01:41:14,113
She herself will make a
place for herself in this world!

884
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:22,121
On this, your new birth,
here's a small gift from me.

885
01:41:23,144 --> 01:41:27,115
No, what's the" - Keep it with you,
there's a big surprise in it!

886
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:29,124
Open it only when I leave!

887
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,160
But this is sheer childishness!

888
01:42:01,349 --> 01:42:04,159
Inder came with the divorce
papers and you signed them!

889
01:42:06,187 --> 01:42:08,167
What else could I do'?

890
01:42:08,356 --> 01:42:11,166
I have told you before too!
You wait and watch"

891
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:13,168
...lnder will come to you one fine day!

892
01:42:14,195 --> 01:42:17,176
Inspite of signing on
the divorce papers? - Yes!

893
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:20,179
Is he going to get
his divorce tomorrow?

894
01:42:21,202 --> 01:42:23,182
Will take at least 6 months!

895
01:42:24,205 --> 01:42:27,186
Pooja, I've handled many cases.
In 6 months"

896
01:42:27,374 --> 01:42:30,184
...there is always a compromise
between the husband and the wife!

897
01:42:31,212 --> 01:42:33,192
And the same will happen in your case!

898
01:42:36,217 --> 01:42:38,197
Yes Pooja!

899
01:42:52,233 --> 01:42:54,213
What's the matter, Raj'?

900
01:43:04,245 --> 01:43:07,226
But the fear refuses to leave, Pooja!
- What fear'?

901
01:43:08,249 --> 01:43:10,229
What fear'?

902
01:43:13,254 --> 01:43:16,235
Pooja, do you know that my
first record is being made today!

903
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:22,241
In some days, this record will
reach all the shops in this city.

904
01:43:23,264 --> 01:43:25,244
People will hear me
for the first time!

905
01:43:25,433 --> 01:43:27,242
If they happen to like my voice
and songs and if my records sell"

906
01:43:27,435 --> 01:43:31,247
...I'd be a star or else
back it's back to square one!

907
01:43:34,275 --> 01:43:36,255
I'm sure that your records
will definitely sell!

908
01:43:37,278 --> 01:43:39,258
Really, Pooja?

909
01:43:39,447 --> 01:43:42,257
Pooja, pray that my records
sell and that I become a star!

910
01:43:43,284 --> 01:43:50,259
I pray that success touches
your feet and that you become..

911
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:53,268
...a very famous singer!

912
01:44:01,302 --> 01:44:03,282
And don't forget to get that perfume!

913
01:44:06,307 --> 01:44:08,287
Can you call Pooja'?

914
01:44:08,476 --> 01:44:10,285
Quick please, my name is Raj!

915
01:44:14,315 --> 01:44:17,296
She's just gone to the
dining room to eat! - Food!

916
01:44:21,322 --> 01:44:23,302
No, Pooja! - What happened?

917
01:44:23,491 --> 01:44:26,301
You can't eat this food! You can't
eat this, haven't I told you'?

918
01:44:26,494 --> 01:44:28,303
Come!

919
01:44:37,505 --> 01:44:39,314
You will get me expelled from this hostel!

920
01:44:40,341 --> 01:44:42,321
Barged into the dining room! Don't you
know that this is a ladies' hostel?

921
01:44:43,344 --> 01:44:45,324
What's the reason for this madness?

922
01:44:48,349 --> 01:44:50,329
See this! - What'?

923
01:44:50,518 --> 01:44:53,328
This is my car! Mine! - Means?

924
01:44:58,359 --> 01:45:00,339
This is the reason for the madness!

925
01:45:02,363 --> 01:45:10,339
And today, your lunch partner would
be the new star on the horizon, Raj!

926
01:45:15,376 --> 01:45:20,348
Achieving so much success in such
a short time, how do you feel?

927
01:45:21,382 --> 01:45:24,363
Success is an amazing
thing, Pooja! - Why'?

928
01:45:25,386 --> 01:45:28,367
The success of just one record
changes the life of the singer!

929
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:32,371
Suddenly a lot of people want to
do a lot of things, give many things"

930
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:37,373
"see this, someone gave the car keys
for a mere stage performance!

931
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:40,379
Another guy wants to take
me on a tour of Europe..

932
01:45:41,402 --> 01:45:43,382
"And he'll give me a big,
well furnished room in return!

933
01:45:44,405 --> 01:45:46,385
And two rival record
companies are fighting"

934
01:45:46,574 --> 01:45:48,383
...for the rights of my records!

935
01:45:48,576 --> 01:45:50,385
Doesn't all this give you happiness?

936
01:45:51,412 --> 01:45:53,392
I feel very happy, Pooja but..

937
01:45:54,415 --> 01:45:56,395
...for the past few days,
the heart is longing for something else!

938
01:45:56,584 --> 01:46:00,396
And it looks like this success,
wealth and fame may not live up..

939
01:46:00,588 --> 01:46:02,397
...to the demands of my heart!

940
01:46:07,428 --> 01:46:10,409
After getting all this what
else does your heart long for'?

941
01:46:22,443 --> 01:46:25,424
Who says that I can't
get drinks? Call the manager.

942
01:46:27,448 --> 01:46:30,429
Get the bar opened.
Can't get the drinks!

943
01:46:40,461 --> 01:46:42,441
Leave me. I'm all right!

944
01:46:46,467 --> 01:46:48,447
How are you'? - I'm fine!

945
01:46:51,472 --> 01:46:54,453
You're fine! Happy!

946
01:46:56,477 --> 01:46:58,457
Inder, this is Raj!

947
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:01,460
We've met before!

948
01:47:03,484 --> 01:47:06,465
Yes, at the party!
You sing very well!

949
01:47:07,488 --> 01:47:10,469
Shall we go'?
Aparna will be waiting!

950
01:47:16,497 --> 01:47:18,477
Inder, have you gone mad'?

951
01:47:20,501 --> 01:47:23,482
Pooja, give my love
to Aparna and Anil!

952
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:31,489
Harish was getting
so embarrased!

953
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:33,488
You two will you
stop your whispering?

954
01:47:34,515 --> 01:47:36,495
Do you know
that we' re about to record'?

955
01:47:36,684 --> 01:47:38,493
Pooja was telling me that she
bumped into lnder at the restaurant!

956
01:47:38,686 --> 01:47:40,495
How is he'?

957
01:47:41,522 --> 01:47:44,503
Was drunk! Tiredness and worries
writ large on his face!

958
01:47:45,526 --> 01:47:49,497
On seeing Raj with me, might
have thought that he's my lover!

959
01:47:50,531 --> 01:47:54,502
Pooja, how do you know that
what he thought isn't true?

960
01:51:23,744 --> 01:51:25,724
L.\ \ \ \, I?' \ > \ K \ k - \ !

961
01:51:31,752 --> 01:51:37,725
Pooja, I didn't mean to
disturb you! I spoke the fact!

962
01:51:38,759 --> 01:51:47,736
Pooja, I.. - Raj, you're a very
good man, gentle and honest but..

963
01:51:48,769 --> 01:51:50,749
...l can't give you anything!

964
01:51:51,772 --> 01:51:53,752
I'm not asking anything
from you, Pooja..

965
01:51:54,775 --> 01:51:56,755
"Just want to make you
realize that I love you!

966
01:51:57,778 --> 01:52:01,749
Love! I don't know the
meaning of this word!

967
01:52:02,783 --> 01:52:04,763
It's not necessary to know
and understand love, PoojaL.

968
01:52:05,786 --> 01:52:07,766
...It needs to be felt!

969
01:52:08,789 --> 01:52:10,769
But I don't want to feel anything!

970
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:12,767
I'd like to live
without any feelings!

971
01:52:13,794 --> 01:52:15,774
Let me live, Raj!

972
01:52:16,797 --> 01:52:19,778
Henceforth, we'll not meet!

973
01:52:42,823 --> 01:52:44,803
Hey, you, here'?

974
01:52:44,992 --> 01:52:46,801
You haven't stopped sucking
your thumb till now'?

975
01:52:46,994 --> 01:52:48,803
How are you'?

976
01:52:48,996 --> 01:52:53,809
Madam, you're strong-hearted!
You live alone here'?

977
01:52:54,835 --> 01:52:58,806
Is everything all right'?
- I'm fine! Very fine!

978
01:52:59,006 --> 01:53:01,816
I tried to find you
for quite some time.

979
01:53:02,009 --> 01:53:07,823
Got your address from Aparna
madam. I used to worry about you!

980
01:53:08,014 --> 01:53:10,824
She used to inquire
about you everyday!

981
01:53:12,853 --> 01:53:14,833
Used to pester me to
take her to your house!

982
01:53:15,022 --> 01:53:16,831
Where would I search for you'?

983
01:53:17,858 --> 01:53:19,838
Has she got admission
in an English school?

984
01:53:20,861 --> 01:53:22,841
I've come for that
very reason, madam!

985
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:24,839
The admissions have
started today.

986
01:53:25,866 --> 01:53:28,847
You please come with me.
People over there talk in English!

987
01:53:29,036 --> 01:53:30,845
I can't understand anything!

988
01:53:31,872 --> 01:53:33,852
And then there are all rich
people's children over there.

989
01:53:34,041 --> 01:53:36,851
They might not admit
her after seeing me!

990
01:53:37,878 --> 01:53:39,858
There wouldn't be
any problems if you come!

991
01:53:40,046 --> 01:53:43,858
Which school? - The one next
to the old house" which one'?

992
01:53:46,887 --> 01:53:49,868
All right, let's go!

993
01:53:52,893 --> 01:53:57,865
Is the child's mother a maid?
- How does it matter?

994
01:53:58,899 --> 01:54:01,880
She has passed all
the tests for admission!

995
01:54:02,903 --> 01:54:05,884
That's fine but our new building
wing is taking shape in our school!

996
01:54:06,073 --> 01:54:08,883
And the requirement of admission
is a donataion of Rs. 1000.

997
01:54:09,076 --> 01:54:11,886
She wouldn't be able to give that!
- I'll give it, madam!

998
01:54:12,913 --> 01:54:14,893
I'll give a 1000 Rs.!

999
01:54:15,916 --> 01:54:18,897
As soon as we get the 1000 Rs.
we'll admit her child.

1000
01:54:28,929 --> 01:54:30,909
Why are you troubling me'?

1001
01:54:34,935 --> 01:54:36,915
What do you want'?

1002
01:54:37,104 --> 01:54:40,916
Pooja, I want to talk to you.
I can't do so here!

1003
01:54:41,942 --> 01:54:43,922
What do you want to talk'?

1004
01:54:48,949 --> 01:54:50,929
Tell me, what do you want to say'?

1005
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:55,931
Well, Pooja, any relation,
no matter how big, how deep..

1006
01:54:56,123 --> 01:54:59,935
...It's a part of life!
Life isn't a part of any relation that..

1007
01:55:00,127 --> 01:55:01,936
"The end of one relation
means the end of life!

1008
01:55:02,963 --> 01:55:05,944
By grieving for the lost relation,
you can't stop living!

1009
01:55:06,967 --> 01:55:09,948
Where have I stopped living?
I'm working, living well!

1010
01:55:10,971 --> 01:55:13,952
You may think that way in spite
of not being able to look..

1011
01:55:14,141 --> 01:55:15,950
"Yourself in the eye, not me!

1012
01:55:16,142 --> 01:55:17,951
Why don't you have the
courage to ask yourself"

1013
01:55:18,145 --> 01:55:20,955
"as to what you want'?
Why are you lying to yourself?

1014
01:55:21,982 --> 01:55:25,953
I'm lying to myself because"

1015
01:55:26,987 --> 01:55:28,967
...I'm tired of the truths of life!

1016
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:32,971
I've heard some bitter truths, Raj!

1017
01:55:35,996 --> 01:55:41,969
I know, Pooja, but all the
truths of life aren't bitter!

1018
01:55:44,004 --> 01:55:46,985
It is a fact that I love you a lot!

1019
01:55:48,008 --> 01:55:50,989
It is a fact that your heart
too has a lot of love for me!

1020
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:52,986
And it is also a fact that
life can't be spent imprisoned"

1021
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:54,989
.by one's sorrows!

1022
01:55:57,017 --> 01:56:01,989
Pooja, whether there is any meaning
in your life, your very being..

1023
01:56:02,189 --> 01:56:04,999
"That's not for me
but for you to decide!

1024
01:56:07,027 --> 01:56:10,998
Don't misunderstand me.
The gap between our friendship won't.

1025
01:56:12,032 --> 01:56:16,003
"Lessen till such time
that you decide for yourself!

1026
01:56:18,038 --> 01:56:20,018
I can't promise you anything, Raj!

1027
01:56:21,041 --> 01:56:24,022
I don't expect any promise
from you, I only wish that..

1028
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:26,020
...you give yourself
one more chance!

1029
01:56:27,047 --> 01:56:30,028
Maybe you'll once again
start believing in life!

1030
01:56:31,051 --> 01:56:34,032
Well, Raj, maybe,
what you say is right.

1031
01:56:35,055 --> 01:56:38,036
"But it's not so easy
for me to agree to all this!

1032
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:43,041
I'll think over it!
- Will you'?

1033
01:56:46,066 --> 01:56:48,046
I'll leave!

1034
01:57:04,084 --> 01:57:06,064
Pooja, this is Kavita's mother!

1035
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:13,071
I'm Dr. Puri, her psychiatrist!

1036
01:57:15,095 --> 01:57:17,075
What' s the matter?

1037
01:57:18,098 --> 01:57:21,079
Well, Kavita is very sick and
the sickness is of the mind!

1038
01:57:22,102 --> 01:57:26,073
The patient has a
variety of hallucinations"

1039
01:57:26,273 --> 01:57:30,085
"and a lot of unfounded fears!

1040
01:57:34,114 --> 01:57:37,095
Whatever medicine we've given
her till now has had no effect!

1041
01:57:37,284 --> 01:57:40,094
Electric shock is
the only treatment left!

1042
01:57:40,287 --> 01:57:43,097
Electric shock is
very painful, child!

1043
01:57:44,124 --> 01:57:46,104
Only you can save her from that pain!

1044
01:57:48,128 --> 01:57:51,109
What Kavita did to you wasn't right!

1045
01:57:53,133 --> 01:57:55,113
She destroyed your well-settled life!

1046
01:57:57,137 --> 01:58:00,118
She's suffering because of that!

1047
01:58:02,142 --> 01:58:07,114
Forgive her, child!
She's only afraid of you!

1048
01:58:09,149 --> 01:58:11,129
Inspite of separating lnder
from you she isn't at peace!

1049
01:58:13,153 --> 01:58:15,133
Her conscience pricks
her all the time!

1050
01:58:17,157 --> 01:58:19,137
She's not mad, child!

1051
01:58:21,161 --> 01:58:25,132
You meet her once,
she'll get rid of all her fears!

1052
01:58:25,332 --> 01:58:27,141
She'll be at peace!

1053
01:58:29,169 --> 01:58:31,149
Will you come with me'?

1054
01:58:32,172 --> 01:58:34,152
She wants to meet you too!

1055
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:00,177
Sit!

1056
01:59:05,205 --> 01:59:07,185
How is your health now'?

1057
01:59:19,219 --> 01:59:22,200
Health? What's happened to me'?

1058
01:59:23,223 --> 01:59:27,194
Do I look sick? Do I look mad'?

1059
01:59:29,229 --> 01:59:34,201
No! - Now what have you
thought of to frighten me'?

1060
01:59:35,235 --> 01:59:36,213
What'?

1061
01:59:43,243 --> 01:59:45,223
What game would you play
at night to frighten me'?

1062
01:59:47,247 --> 01:59:49,227
Are you afraid of me'?

1063
01:59:51,251 --> 01:59:53,231
Why, Kavita'?

1064
01:59:55,255 --> 01:59:58,236
For the past few days,
you have made life miserable for me!

1065
01:59:59,259 --> 02:00:01,239
You come over every night and cry!

1066
02:00:03,263 --> 02:00:07,234
And cry so very cleverly
that only I can hear!

1067
02:00:09,269 --> 02:00:12,250
What do you get by coming
to my house and crying?

1068
02:00:15,275 --> 02:00:17,255
Does crying lessen sadness?

1069
02:00:23,283 --> 02:00:25,263
Are you trying to
nullify your deeds?

1070
02:00:27,287 --> 02:00:29,267
Trying to tell me that
it's my imagination!

1071
02:00:33,293 --> 02:00:37,264
It could be so! Could be!

1072
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:44,271
So how do I get your
smell from my bedsheets'?

1073
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:54,292
Why do you sleep between
lnder and me like a wall?

1074
02:00:54,481 --> 02:00:56,290
Aren't you ashamed?

1075
02:00:57,317 --> 02:01:01,288
Inder is now mine!
He was your husband sometimes!

1076
02:01:02,322 --> 02:01:04,302
And now he has divorced you too!

1077
02:01:06,326 --> 02:01:09,307
Well, Pooja, we' re getting married!

1078
02:01:11,331 --> 02:01:14,312
How can you sleep with
some other woman's husband?

1079
02:01:14,501 --> 02:01:16,310
Aren't you ashamed?

1080
02:01:17,337 --> 02:01:22,309
And why did you throw your
marriage ritual chain here?

1081
02:01:23,343 --> 02:01:30,318
So that the small black beads
pierce into my legs all the time!

1082
02:01:31,351 --> 02:01:36,323
I get tired cleaning this
floor from morn to night!

1083
02:01:37,357 --> 02:01:40,338
Don't know how they manage
to come under my feet even then!

1084
02:01:41,361 --> 02:01:43,341
Don't know!

1085
02:01:44,364 --> 02:01:46,344
See this!

1086
02:01:49,369 --> 02:01:53,340
Do you recognize this?
This isn't my imagination, right'?

1087
02:01:58,378 --> 02:02:04,351
Pooja, I'm tired!
I can't bear it any more!

1088
02:02:06,386 --> 02:02:08,366
You take my life
if you so desire!

1089
02:02:09,389 --> 02:02:12,370
But don't take your revenge
by frightening me like this!

1090
02:02:13,393 --> 02:02:18,365
Please, Pooja, forgive me!

1091
02:02:22,402 --> 02:02:24,382
Do I still look like mad to you'?

1092
02:02:25,405 --> 02:02:27,385
No, Kavita!

1093
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:38,386
You're not mad!
- So leave! Go from here!

1094
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:47,395
I'm going, and I'd like you
to be safe in the knowledge that..

1095
02:02:48,428 --> 02:02:50,408
...l will never come here again.

1096
02:03:03,443 --> 02:03:08,415
Pooja, I never wished ill for you!

1097
02:03:10,450 --> 02:03:14,421
I liked lnder, not your husband!

1098
02:03:15,455 --> 02:03:21,428
I wanted to settle my house,
not destroy yours!

1099
02:03:21,628 --> 02:03:25,440
Forget it, Kavita.
I never had a house"!

1100
02:03:25,632 --> 02:03:29,444
So you never destroyed anything!
Take care of yourself.

1101
02:03:48,488 --> 02:03:50,468
I'll leave!

1102
02:03:52,492 --> 02:03:55,473
Inder, don't leave me alone!

1103
02:03:58,498 --> 02:04:00,478
Pooja, your phone!

1104
02:04:00,667 --> 02:04:02,476
You leave, I'll join you!

1105
02:04:17,517 --> 02:04:19,497
Tell him I'm coming.

1106
02:04:23,523 --> 02:04:28,495
Anil, this is Pooja.
That maid of mine..

1107
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:32,510
"She has murdered her husband!

1108
02:04:32,699 --> 02:04:35,509
You come to Khar Police
Station immediately.

1109
02:04:37,537 --> 02:04:39,517
Is this her own statement?
- Yes!

1110
02:04:47,547 --> 02:04:50,528
She has written in her
statement that her husband"

1111
02:04:50,717 --> 02:04:55,530
"stole the money she'd kept
aside for her child's education.

1112
02:04:55,721 --> 02:04:59,533
In the morning when she found
the money missing she went in search"

1113
02:04:59,726 --> 02:05:02,536
...of her husband and found
him at his mistress' place.

1114
02:05:03,563 --> 02:05:05,543
He was inebriated.
They had a fight.

1115
02:05:07,567 --> 02:05:12,539
And then, she has written that
she killed her husband with a knife.

1116
02:05:22,582 --> 02:05:24,562
You may meet her.

1117
02:05:32,592 --> 02:05:33,570
Madam!

1118
02:05:36,596 --> 02:05:39,577
I toiled to save that money!

1119
02:05:42,602 --> 02:05:49,577
He spoilt my life..
didn't even think about his daughter!

1120
02:05:54,614 --> 02:05:56,594
What will happen of her, madam?

1121
02:05:58,618 --> 02:06:00,598
She hasn't got anyone of her own!

1122
02:06:01,621 --> 02:06:05,592
Now it's sweeping and cleaning
utensils in her destiny too!

1123
02:06:07,627 --> 02:06:10,608
I haven't taught her that too!

1124
02:06:14,634 --> 02:06:20,607
What all had I dreamt of!
Can't do anything!

1125
02:06:25,645 --> 02:06:29,616
What will happen of
my daughter, madam?

1126
02:06:32,652 --> 02:06:37,624
Don't worry, I'm there!

1127
02:06:45,665 --> 02:06:49,636
Harish, you know that the court
has accepted my divorce request!

1128
02:06:50,670 --> 02:06:56,643
I'm getting married to Kavita.
I'll get some cards from the house.

1129
02:06:56,843 --> 02:06:58,652
As you're going to the city,
distribute them among our clients.

1130
02:07:03,683 --> 02:07:05,663
Inder, I want to tell
you something! - What'?

1131
02:07:10,690 --> 02:07:14,661
Inder, 7 years back, I had
decorated your marriage venue!

1132
02:07:15,695 --> 02:07:17,675
The one where your marriage
to Pooja took place!

1133
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:21,678
So?

1134
02:07:24,704 --> 02:07:27,685
Inder, these hands haven't
changed as much as you've changed!

1135
02:07:30,710 --> 02:07:32,690
That's why..

1136
02:07:35,715 --> 02:07:39,686
"Take this! - What's this?

1137
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,700
My resignation letter.

1138
02:08:07,747 --> 02:08:09,727
Who tore these wedding cards'?

1139
02:08:09,916 --> 02:08:15,730
Me! - But why'?

1140
02:08:18,758 --> 02:08:20,738
What has happened to you'?

1141
02:08:21,761 --> 02:08:26,733
I came to my senses!
After tearing the first card"

1142
02:08:27,767 --> 02:08:31,738
...l felt a different
sense of satisfaction.

1143
02:08:36,776 --> 02:08:40,747
After meeting Pooja,
a question cropped up in my mind!

1144
02:08:42,782 --> 02:08:47,754
A marriage which couldn't give
her any security in 7 years"

1145
02:08:50,790 --> 02:08:52,770
"what security will it give me'?

1146
02:08:53,793 --> 02:08:55,773
What have you decided to do now'?

1147
02:08:57,797 --> 02:08:59,777
What do you want Kavita'?

1148
02:08:59,966 --> 02:09:02,776
What I want is something
I haven't found out till now.

1149
02:09:03,803 --> 02:09:08,775
But today I've found out
what I don't want!

1150
02:09:09,809 --> 02:09:13,780
Inder, I don't want to live
this life of lies and deceit!

1151
02:09:14,814 --> 02:09:17,795
I don't want to live off the
alms given to me by Pooja!

1152
02:09:18,818 --> 02:09:20,798
Don't want a married life
living in the shadows of the curses"

1153
02:09:20,987 --> 02:09:22,796
...of a married woman!

1154
02:09:24,824 --> 02:09:29,796
Inder, you left Pooja for me!

1155
02:09:31,831 --> 02:09:35,802
You may desert me for somebody else!

1156
02:09:36,836 --> 02:09:38,816
No, Kavita!

1157
02:09:42,842 --> 02:09:44,822
I can't live with this new fear!

1158
02:09:48,848 --> 02:09:51,829
What has happened to you
all of a sudden?

1159
02:09:53,853 --> 02:09:56,834
I've noticed the flaws
in this relationship!

1160
02:09:57,857 --> 02:09:59,837
You leave!

1161
02:10:01,861 --> 02:10:06,833
No! No, Kavita!
- lnder, you leave!

1162
02:10:07,033 --> 02:10:08,842
You can't do this to me!
- You go!

1163
02:10:09,869 --> 02:10:11,849
You can't do this to me, Kavita!

1164
02:10:12,872 --> 02:10:17,844
Inder, you leave!

1165
02:10:21,881 --> 02:10:23,861
Ma, is Kavita all right'?

1166
02:10:24,050 --> 02:10:26,860
She's all right. For the first
time she's made the right decision!

1167
02:10:27,887 --> 02:10:30,868
Let her go! - Ma!

1168
02:10:31,891 --> 02:10:36,863
You go to Pooja,
that would benefit everybody!

1169
02:10:37,063 --> 02:10:43,878
It isn't your right any more but chances
are that Pooja will forgive you!

1170
02:10:46,906 --> 02:10:48,886
Please go! Go!

1171
02:11:15,935 --> 02:11:17,915
Why are you standing outside?
Come in!

1172
02:11:18,938 --> 02:11:20,918
I want to talk to Pooja!

1173
02:11:21,941 --> 02:11:24,922
Aparna, you go!
- Come, child!

1174
02:11:25,945 --> 02:11:27,925
She'll just come!

1175
02:11:34,954 --> 02:11:35,932
Say!

1176
02:11:36,956 --> 02:11:38,936
Pooja, I..

1177
02:11:43,963 --> 02:11:46,944
There's nothing between
Kavita and me now!

1178
02:11:47,967 --> 02:11:49,947
Really!

1179
02:11:51,971 --> 02:11:54,952
Just consider that
she has rejected me!

1180
02:11:58,978 --> 02:12:01,959
Pooja, anyway she could
never get me away from you!

1181
02:12:02,982 --> 02:12:06,953
I'm very sorry, lnder,
but I can't help you in any way!

1182
02:12:07,987 --> 02:12:12,959
Pooja, I've not come
to you for any help.

1183
02:12:13,993 --> 02:12:15,973
What then?

1184
02:12:18,998 --> 02:12:22,969
I've lost, I'm tired, Pooja.

1185
02:12:26,005 --> 02:12:27,985
It's true that I've given
you a lot of troubles"

1186
02:12:28,174 --> 02:12:31,986
"and it's also a fact that
I will never ever go back to Kavita.

1187
02:12:34,013 --> 02:12:36,994
I want to start
life all over again!

1188
02:12:38,017 --> 02:12:39,997
Wilh you!

1189
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:44,991
I promise, Pooja, assure you
that I will never ever..

1190
02:12:45,191 --> 02:12:49,003
...give you any reason for complaints!

1191
02:12:49,195 --> 02:12:52,005
Really, POOP!

1192
02:12:53,032 --> 02:12:55,012
Tell me one more truth, lnder!
- What?

1193
02:12:58,037 --> 02:13:02,008
Whatever you did to me,
if I had done the same thing"

1194
02:13:03,042 --> 02:13:08,014
"and had come back to you like this,
would you have accepted me'?

1195
02:13:18,057 --> 02:13:19,035
No!

1196
02:13:49,088 --> 02:13:51,068
I met Aparna and Anil.

1197
02:13:52,091 --> 02:13:56,062
They told me about this child.

1198
02:14:03,102 --> 02:14:06,083
Pooja, by supporting this
child you have" - No, Raj.

1199
02:14:07,106 --> 02:14:11,077
I haven't given her support
but have got something from her!

1200
02:14:13,112 --> 02:14:19,085
A chance to be a mother!
A chance to share my solitude!

1201
02:14:25,624 --> 02:14:26,602
And now'?

1202
02:14:29,629 --> 02:14:34,601
Raj, legally Malhotra isn't
a part of my name any more.

1203
02:14:36,635 --> 02:14:44,611
I'm fully aware of my own self today!
- I can see that!

1204
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:47,624
I can feel that too!

1205
02:14:49,649 --> 02:14:53,620
One day you had said that
I'm complete by myself"

1206
02:14:55,655 --> 02:15:01,628
...I'd like to separate my name
from all other names and live as Pooja!

1207
02:15:08,667 --> 02:15:10,647
Don't misunderstand me, Raj.

1208
02:15:10,836 --> 02:15:15,649
I'm grateful to you that
you have always helped me!

1209
02:15:15,842 --> 02:15:22,657
You've supported me but today
your support will weaken me!

1210
02:15:22,848 --> 02:15:24,657
Very weak!

1211
02:15:28,687 --> 02:15:31,668
I will never forget you, Raj!

1212
02:15:31,857 --> 02:15:35,669
If ever I have to return
I'll come back to you!

1213
02:15:36,696 --> 02:15:41,668
But, let me go today!

1214
02:15:45,705 --> 02:15:47,685
Go, Pooja!

1215
02:15:51,711 --> 02:15:53,691
The courage that
has awakened within you..

1216
02:15:53,879 --> 02:15:55,688
"That's the true
meaning of life!

1217
02:15:57,716 --> 02:16:02,688
Now you will never
need any Malhotra or Raj!

1218
02:16:07,726 --> 02:16:09,706
I'll not stop you
for my selfish motives!

1219
02:16:11,731 --> 02:16:12,709
