1
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:23,324
What is this! Not again!

2
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:25,371
You see, Savitri..

3
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:28,138
How long will you go on risking
your life for your employer?

4
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,378
Look Savitri, we are
deeply indebted to him.

5
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:37,371
Even if I were to die for him,
I wouldn't be able to repay him.

6
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:42,273
Why risk your life like this?
Why not inform the police?

7
00:00:42,553 --> 00:00:48,971
Not now. I suspect his step brother
Girdhar. But I don't know for sure..

8
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:52,376
You look for some other job.

9
00:00:55,945 --> 00:01:02,661
Remember when Arjun was sick?
The doctors here had given up.

10
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,359
And he flew in doctors from America.
He spent hundreds of thousands!

11
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:11,402
Can we ever forget
what he did for us?

12
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:12,973
What a thing to say!

13
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:19,245
lf my son is alive today,
it's all because of Savitri.

14
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,309
No money is enough to
pay for a mother's milk.

15
00:01:25,42 --> 00:01:29,274
Were it not for you and Savitri,
I would've been without an heir.

16
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,876
Why did you take the
trouble of coming here?

17
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:36,411
You could've called me over.
- The matter deserved a visit.

18
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:42,490
I have appointed Savitri
as the trustee of my will.

19
00:01:43,176 --> 00:01:45,34
I?

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,179
Yes, my sister.

21
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:53,25
We live in the shadow of death.
Should anything happen to us..

22
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:56,678
..there should be
someone to look after my son.

23
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:00,619
In any case, my Raju has
taken to you like his own mother.

24
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:08,295
Mr. Mehta. - Yes. - Handover the
trust's papers to sister Savitri.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,566
Till things change for the better..

26
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:14,39
..send Raju to live with
my friend Mathur, in London.

27
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:19,66
You've placed a grave
responsibility on our shoulders.

28
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:22,245
People might misconstrue it
and say that for your money..

29
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:25,296
I don't care what they say.

30
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,430
I thought it over before I did it.

31
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:30,882
Besides, who do I have but you?
- Fire..

32
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,67
Sir!

33
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:03,608
Savitri.. you have
to fulfill my duty.

34
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,972
You will have to take care
of sir's son, Rajkumar.

35
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,334
And you will have to bring him up..

36
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:14,189
..as your own. Even if you have to..

37
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,553
..sacrifice the
interests of your own son, Arjun.

38
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,569
I promise!

39
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:22,702
I will care for him
more than my own son!

40
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,717
Mr. Mehta, take Raja away from here!

41
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:28,729
But in this condition?

42
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,880
Just do as I say! Go away!

43
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:41,403
And that money! You
must never touch it!

44
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,315
Never!

45
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:59,634
Send Arjun away to his grandfather
Dashrathh Singh in Lakhanpur.

46
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:00,949
Lakhanpur?

47
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:04,248
You must complete
my responsibility!

48
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,942
No.

49
00:04:24,43 --> 00:04:25,489
Let go of me.

50
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:41,758
I am opening it.

51
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:46,764
Dashrath Singh?
- Yes.

52
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:52,165
Your grandson. Arjun.

53
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:59,18
His father has been murdered.

54
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,273
Bhim Singh?

55
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:03,797
Killed?

56
00:05:04,71 --> 00:05:07,813
Who killed him? Tell me!

57
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:15,421
Now I have
delivered your heir to you!

58
00:05:16,3 --> 00:05:18,882
Where is his mother?

59
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:22,842
She..
- Tell me!

60
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:38,144
You shameless woman!
You are a slur on womanhood!

61
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:44,46
A woman prays to God
for her husband's life!

62
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:48,683
And you! You killed your
husband for the sake of money!

63
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:52,221
No! That isn't true!

64
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:53,729
Just get out of here!

65
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,195
Get out of here before
I start cursing you!

66
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,739
Go away! Get out, I say!

67
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:07,992
lf this be my fate,
I have to go away.

68
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:17,653
But for once! Please!
Let me embrace my son!

69
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:22,978
I won't let you go anywhere
near him! He isn't your son!

70
00:06:23,58 --> 00:06:25,248
He's my heir! My blood!

71
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:29,558
You killed my son!
And I gave him to you!

72
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,907
Now you want my heir!

73
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:37,504
And who will give my
son back to me? Tell me!

74
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:45,586
As of today, I
cannot prove my innocence.

75
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:50,376
Let it be as you wish.

76
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:58,369
But some day, you will
know for sure. I am innocent.

77
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:03,685
But if this is what you wish..

78
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:10,584
..then I will make a sacrifice
my love for your happiness.

79
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:16,385
For your sake I will
forget that I ever bore a son!

80
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:22,436
What greater test
for a mother than this?

81
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:27,19
Then promise me that you'll never
tell him that you are his mother.

82
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:31,758
All right.

83
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:41,398
I swear on Arjun. I will never
tell him that I am his mother.

84
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:47,765
lf he ever asks for his mother..

85
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:54,469
..tell him that his mother is dead.

86
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:00,360
What brings you so early,
Mr. Mehta?

87
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,397
Have you seen the newspaper?
- Newspaper?

88
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:08,661
No. What is it?
- Bad news. But for us, it's good.

89
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:13,429
Plane crash? - Yes. Girdhar
died in the Pune plane crash.

90
00:08:13,906 --> 00:08:15,820
Now there's no
threat to Raju's life.

91
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,224
lf you so wish, we can
call Raju back from London.

92
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:24,879
No. I want to give him
the best of education.

93
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,193
Let him take his education.
Let him stay there till..

94
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:32,298
..he is mature enough to
assume his father's mantle.

95
00:08:33,73 --> 00:08:35,645
You'll fall asleep in a minute now.

96
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,462
Sleep.

97
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:43,474
Sleep, come into the eyes.

98
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:46,954
Sleep, come slowly.

99
00:08:47,35 --> 00:08:51,141
Sleep, come into the eyes.

100
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:55,701
Wake up, the sacred one.

101
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:58,256
Wake up, the sacred one.

102
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:01,214
Arjun! Arjun!

103
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:06,339
The sun is up! Get up. Hey Arjun.

104
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,396
No! I won't let you go!

105
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:14,468
You are my whole life!
I'm not letting you go!

106
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:18,302
I'm not letting you go!
- Hey Arjun! - I'm not letting..

107
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,760
Grandpa you?

108
00:09:29,63 --> 00:09:31,247
So it was a dream!

109
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,699
Who were you dreaming about?

110
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:36,701
Go on. Tell Grandpa.

111
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't feel shy!

112
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,261
Who did you see in your dream?

113
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:42,624
You.

114
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,847
Me.
- Yes.

115
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:48,263
In the dream, I saw
Grandpa is leaving me.

116
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:51,582
And I'm screaming,
grandpa don't leave me!

117
00:09:51,662 --> 00:09:54,468
You are my whole life!
I'll die without you!

118
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:56,601
Oh no!

119
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:59,264
I thought you were
going ahead in life!

120
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:01,139
But you're just the same.

121
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:03,798
You're a young man.
And you dream of me!

122
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,225
There's lot more to dream about!

123
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,364
Lot more to dream about.. about?

124
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:13,421
You're everything to me!
I listen to you! Look up to you!

125
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:16,47
And you are all I have!

126
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,356
Who else can I dream about?

127
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:22,861
All of 25 years, and still a baby!

128
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:25,876
At your age, they dream of mermaids!

129
00:10:26,41 --> 00:10:29,750
They sing songs, and their
eyes are bright with desire!

130
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,602
What about you?

131
00:10:32,38 --> 00:10:33,99
I do too.

132
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,989
What? I like mermaids.

133
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,721
I love songs. And I'm
bright with desire too.

134
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:44,65
Desire? What?

135
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:47,743
Oh I want to take care of you!

136
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:52,337
And I want a big house.
And a large farm.

137
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,863
And I am going to feed you!

138
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:57,595
lf that's what you
dream in your youth..

139
00:10:57,675 --> 00:11:00,368
..then something is
seriously wrong! - What's so wrong?

140
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:05,65
Nothing! Just get out bed.
- Remember when I was a kid?

141
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:08,707
You used to pick me out
of bed. Go on. Pick me up.

142
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,133
Good God! Don't
people get older with age?

143
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:20,261
I know. It must be that song.
Now on, I'll play another song.

144
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,936
Which one?
- Wake up to a beautiful morning!

145
00:11:24,16 --> 00:11:25,932
What a shame! At your age!

146
00:11:26,12 --> 00:11:28,260
What the hell do you mean?!

147
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:31,576
Never mind. Now get out of bed.

148
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:36,519
Now take you. You were a
Private when you joined the army.

149
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:39,962
And when you retired,
you were a an officer.

150
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,616
You've seen many lands.

151
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,528
You've fought so many wars.

152
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,16
And you've seen the world.

153
00:11:46,97 --> 00:11:49,894
But your Arjun hasn't seen
anything in the village!

154
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:53,963
That's what I want to consult
you about. What do I do with him?

155
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,702
Send him to the city
to live with my son.

156
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:57,650
The city!

157
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:02,569
No! I've already
Lost a son in the city!

158
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:04,714
It's going to break my heart!

159
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:10,602
Sometimes you have to accept
sorrows for the sake of happiness.

160
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,19
You will have to bear with it.

161
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,584
Besides, my son
Bhairav is also in the city.

162
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:22,44
I'll write to him.
He'll find a job for Arjun.

163
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:23,511
You send him to the city.

164
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,65
All right.

165
00:12:42,907 --> 00:12:45,170
I heard everything!

166
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,170
You want me to go to the city!

167
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,657
And Bhairav is
going to give me a job!

168
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,265
I'm not going anywhere!

169
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,747
You cared for me all my life.
And now that I'm grown up..

170
00:12:56,963 --> 00:13:01,123
..you want to kick me out!
No way! I'm not going.

171
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:03,355
I can never leave you!

172
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,104
You want to be a
liability to me all your life?

173
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,203
Sure! I've been a
liability all my life!

174
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:12,858
Why do you want to
throw me out of the house?

175
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:14,553
Do you want me to get
Lost in the big bad city?

176
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,600
Six-foot four! And
he talks like a sissy!

177
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:22,397
How long are you going to
rot here? Go to the city.

178
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:26,26
Stand on your own feet!
- But I'm standing on my own feet!

179
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:27,199
Look at my legs!

180
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:34,105
Have you no brains?

181
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:38,40
A man is born twice.

182
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:41,348
First he is born of his mother.

183
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:47,483
Second, he goes out to the world.
And he makes a name for himself.

184
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:51,578
You must make a name for yourself.

185
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:56,639
Make me proud of my grandson!

186
00:13:57,56 --> 00:14:00,5
Go on. Do something
while I'm still alive!

187
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,223
I haven't much time left.
My time is nearly up.

188
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:06,439
No! Don't say that!

189
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,333
lf your time to die comes,
I will go instead of you!

190
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:09,938
I'll tell him that I am grandpa!

191
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,665
You want me to go to the city?

192
00:14:12,823 --> 00:14:13,831
All right. I'm going.

193
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,135
I'll make a name for myself.
And I'll stand on my own feet!

194
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:18,700
Happy?

195
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:24,36
God bless you, son!
- But don't talk of dying!

196
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,502
God bless you, dear.

197
00:14:28,123 --> 00:14:31,406
Its time I told you a
well-preserved secret of my life.

198
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:33,934
You must always keep this in mind.

199
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:40,136
Son, 20 years ago, you
were in boarding school.

200
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,310
I was coming back to
Bombay after seeing you.

201
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:48,680
At Pune airport, I saw a man.

202
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,934
He was pleading desperately with
an officer for a ticket to Bombay.

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,134
A dying relative in
Bombay or something like that.

204
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,146
But the flight was full.

205
00:15:02,70 --> 00:15:05,210
I took pity on him and
I gave him my ticket.

206
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,410
He thanked me profusely and he
boarded the flight to Bombay.

207
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,454
The flight took off on
what was it's last flight.

208
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:15,35
A few minutes later..

209
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:21,772
..the flight crashed against
the mountains of Panvel.

210
00:15:23,69 --> 00:15:26,252
Everyone on board died.
And there I was. Alive.

211
00:15:27,74 --> 00:15:30,325
Maybe because of that one
good deed I ever did in my life.

212
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:32,852
That ticket, you know.
I gave it to a man in need.

213
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:37,540
But my name was on the
list of the casualties.

214
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:41,437
And I took full
advantage of the slip.

215
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:43,706
To the world, I was dead.

216
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:48,633
Understood? That was the
first part of the story.

217
00:15:50,97 --> 00:15:50,987
Come.

218
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:57,704
Here's the second
part of the story, son.

219
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,674
Daddy, this is my boss!

220
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:02,636
Not your boss! She is your servant.

221
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:04,143
No more than a servant.

222
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:09,754
This is the Sanyal hotel in
Bombay where you work as a manager.

223
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:15,982
Singapore, Hong Kong,
London, America.

224
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:19,494
You own half of all this property.

225
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:23,268
Half! What are you saying,
daddy? I own half of all this?!

226
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:25,636
No daddy. Don't joke with me!
I'm going to go insane!

227
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:30,277
Don't. And listen to me carefully.
The person who owned all this..

228
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,651
..was my brother.
Sanyal. He was my elder.

229
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,773
This is his photo.

230
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:38,834
My uncle?

231
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,372
He was my stepbrother.

232
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,938
I tried to kill him. I
also tried to kill his son.

233
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:49,383
Sanyal died. And that Bhim Singh..

234
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:54,35
..died trying to save his boss.
Bhim Singh was very loyal.

235
00:16:55,67 --> 00:16:57,741
Savitri was Bhim Singh's wife.

236
00:16:58,34 --> 00:17:00,178
She's the woman you call boss!

237
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,773
She sent my nephew into hiding.
To a place safe enough.

238
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,521
So that when he grows up he
can assume his father's mantle.

239
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:09,731
But she doesn't know
that I have a son too.

240
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:13,483
Daddy, I get it!

241
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,875
I won't spoil the opportunity
you've waited for all you life.

242
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,637
Till today, I've been
managing their hotel in Bombay.

243
00:17:21,66 --> 00:17:25,909
But now, I'm going to
start eating at its roots.

244
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:28,500
Not as easy as you think.

245
00:17:29,92 --> 00:17:32,832
Rajkumar is expected to return.
Find him before he can come back.

246
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:35,32
Find him before he
assumes his father's mantle.

247
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:39,330
Find him. And kill him.

248
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,930
Stand in a row.

249
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:41,839
Take this.

250
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,109
Aunt, why the sweets?

251
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,346
It's my son's birthday today.
- Where's your son?

252
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,661
Excuse me.

253
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:53,604
Greetings, can you tell
me where this place is?

254
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,979
I've just come to town.
This is my friend's address.

255
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:01,257
First right off the main road.
It's the first house.

256
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,233
Thanks.
- Listen.. - Yes?

257
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:08,405
Have this.
- What's this?

258
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:14,266
A sweet. For my son's birthday.
- Great! It's my birthday too!

259
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:15,160
Really?
- Yes!

260
00:18:15,364 --> 00:18:18,344
But my mother is dead.

261
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:22,171
Well, never mind that.
You're just like my mother.

262
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:24,790
Thank you, mother.

263
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,702
Cab!

264
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,752
So one more adds to
the millions unemployed.

265
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:37,764
But you told me to come here
as I am educated and a grown up!

266
00:18:37,844 --> 00:18:39,511
And here I am.

267
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,650
Very nice. But why didn't
you write to me before coming?

268
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,144
I hadn't a chance!
Grandpa was after my life.

269
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:49,540
He wanted me to come to
the city to stand on my feet!

270
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,256
So here I am. To stand on my feet.

271
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,780
Very good. - You'll find me a job,
won't you? - Now that you're here..

272
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,310
I guess something has to
be done.

273
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:02,13
I have a friend, he's a manager in
a big hotel. It's a five star hotel.

274
00:19:02,93 --> 00:19:04,93
Look, I don't care.
I just want a job.

275
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:07,469
Well all right. But what
kind of a dress is this?

276
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:12,237
You forgot! I had worn this on
Rao sir's daughter's marriage too!

277
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,636
What could be better than this?

278
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,511
I guess I'm paying for your clothes!

279
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:20,314
No matter. Now go and take a wash.
I'll talk to him about you.

280
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,543
Here comes Arjun Singh!

281
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:25,937
Who the hell?

282
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,146
The moustache-man!

283
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:41,115
So you were taking snaps when
I was with that fatso's wife?

284
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:45,186
Not my neck! I don't mean ill!

285
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,446
Let go of my neck!

286
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,721
Give me the negatives.
- What negatives?

287
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:51,187
The snaps you took.

288
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,166
Where are the negatives?
- Inside the camera.

289
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:58,741
Where's the camera?
- On the table!

290
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:01,985
Where's the table?
- In that corner!

291
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:06,726
Which corner?
- That corner!

292
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,546
I'll see.

293
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:13,547
Oh my God. What are you doing?

294
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:17,175
My roll! No! Don't expose it!

295
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:19,880
What have you done!
- If you ever try..

296
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:24,167
..to shoot me while
I'm with a woman..

297
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:27,508
..I'll bury you alive!

298
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,636
Fool. Get it?

299
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:44,821
Just joking. Like old friends!

300
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:58,784
Greetings, sir. - Oh God,
I am done for. Greetings, sir.

301
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:01,213
Did you get the snaps?
- Yes.

302
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:05,754
Give them to me.
I'll fix my wife now.

303
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,420
And I'll fix that moustache-man!

304
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,398
That fellow has an eye
for other men's wives.

305
00:21:11,657 --> 00:21:12,749
What a profound thought!

306
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:18,447
Stop staring and give me the snaps.

307
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:22,426
I got them. But something went wrong.
The snaps didn't come through.

308
00:21:22,506 --> 00:21:27,646
What do you mean? I've sued my
wife on the basis of those snaps!

309
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:30,713
I've paid the lawyers!
And I paid you in advance!

310
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,435
And now you tell me
something went wrong!

311
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:35,355
Not my fault. The
camera malfunctioned.

312
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:37,820
Where's the lousy camera?
- On the table!

313
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,528
Where's the table?
- In that corner!

314
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:41,304
Which corner?
- That corner!

315
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,453
So is this the camera?
- Yes.

316
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,449
I'll make sure the camera
doesn't give you the slip!

317
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:50,554
Smashed my camera!
- Shut up! You idiot!

318
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:55,685
lf I ever see you here,
I'm going to break your legs!

319
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,544
Just joking. Like old friends!

320
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:09,637
Now don't get angry!
And don't go back. Please!

321
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,772
Or I'll be exposed.
Grandpa will get angry with me.

322
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,686
I'll get you a good job.

323
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,562
Look, there is a party today.
Now get dressed.

324
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:18,996
We're partying tonight.

325
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:02,600
Hello Tom.. Tom..

326
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:09,317
Fabulous!

327
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:11,187
Fantastic!

328
00:23:12,16 --> 00:23:14,253
What is it?
- Talk in whispers here!

329
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,546
This is a big hotel!

330
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:22,55
Bhairav, I hope no one
is going to bash you up?

331
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:25,983
Not here! No one dares
lift a finger against me!

332
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,985
lf you get bashed up once again,
I'm getting into the act.

333
00:23:29,215 --> 00:23:36,252
And I'll make sure I write home.
- Please! Don't do anything here!

334
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:39,793
People respect me here.
- Respect you?

335
00:23:40,122 --> 00:23:44,453
Is that clear?
- Yes.

336
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,183
Come with me.

337
00:23:56,899 --> 00:23:58,348
Being educated,
you've ruined everything.

338
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:01,456
Why? What happened?
- You were supposed to take a glass.

339
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:05,855
Not the whole tray. - I didn't
know that! What do I do now?

340
00:24:06,45 --> 00:24:07,146
Give it back.

341
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:12,480
Believe me, darling! I

00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:57,266
Sing.. - What's he saying?
- He wants.. - Actually..

356
00:27:57,346 --> 00:28:00,907
I have a sore throat. I can't sing.

357
00:28:01,156 --> 00:28:04,419
I touched your hand. You
are a very strong man.

358
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:06,972
I want to hear you!
I want to hear your voice!

Arjun. Give him a
big hand. A big hand!

You're singing!

366
00:28:29,81 --> 00:28:31,848
No, no. I am not singing.

00:28:31,928 --> 00:28:35,275

There are big people here.
You might land a job!

375
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,523
Am I going to get the job?
- As good as done.

376
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:18,86
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend
is going to sing now.

I am here. Start singing.

378
00:29:20,496 --> 00:29:23,35
Yes, orchestra! Ready?

379
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:57,712
Old people told us
to stand on our feet.

380
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,335
Then you will
rule over this world.

381
00:30:02,83 --> 00:30:07,695
Go hand in hand with
the upcoming generation.

382
00:30:08,63 --> 00:30:14,128
Then you will be able
to anything you want to.

383
00:30:14,895 --> 00:30:23,128
Then, look here. I am
standing on my feet.

384
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:25,836
And I've begun to get
in sync with the world.

385
00:30:27,58 --> 00:30:32,60
The whole world will be amazed.

386
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:40,694
The world will be
astonished to see us.

387
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:42,772
Wonderful. Wonderful.

388
00:30:43,70 --> 00:30:52,598
Thank you. Anklets in the feet.

389
00:30:55,988 --> 00:31:01,275
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

390
00:31:06,31 --> 00:31:10,462
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

391
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:15,705
I danced without anklets.

392
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:20,64
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

393
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:28,961
The arrow is of no use,
which misses its target.

394
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:33,621
With anklets in her feet.

395
00:31:34,10 --> 00:31:40,510
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

396
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:45,869
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

397
00:32:44,31 --> 00:32:49,599
You seem a double faced man to me.

398
00:32:50,85 --> 00:32:55,16
You look like a thief to me.

399
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:59,351
You've spent your life in robbery..

400
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:04,670
..and have kept all your
happiness in locker of sins.

401
00:33:08,88 --> 00:33:15,94
I feel your dream is.. praise
the lord and fill your pockets.

402
00:33:15,174 --> 00:33:22,521
I feel your dream is.. praise
the lord and fill your pockets.

403
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:27,815
lf you live in this country,
be honest to it.

404
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:32,928
Be an example of
honesty for everyone.

405
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:38,530
Don't look at other's
money or other's wife.

406
00:33:38,941 --> 00:33:43,495
It is a bad habit, so change it.

407
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:53,698
Because, this habit
ruins your house one day.

408
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:57,967
With anklets in her feet.

409
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:04,782
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

410
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:09,901
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

411
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:39,646
You are my little love.

412
00:34:43,284 --> 00:34:47,261
Little, little love.

413
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:21,144
I am the desire
mesmerized in love.

414
00:35:22,84 --> 00:35:29,944
I feel we are made for each other.

415
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:37,582
I feel, I am not thinking wrong.

416
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:46,825
I feel, you are my
own and not a stranger.

417
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:53,333
You are carved marble statue.

418
00:35:54,583 --> 00:36:00,978
You are very
charming and beautiful.

419
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:10,48
You are very auspicious.
People crave for you.

420
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:19,569
I'll tear open my chest to
show your beautiful face.

421
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:29,352
Don't you think we've met before?

422
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:34,157
Your beauty, your youth,
your name are wonderful.

423
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:41,762
Why should I
bother about all that.

424
00:36:41,842 --> 00:36:43,777
Listen to me.

425
00:36:44,86 --> 00:36:52,807
When we meet our Romeo and
Juliet stories will begin.

426
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:57,168
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

427
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:02,87
I danced without anklets.

428
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:07,286
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

429
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:12,901
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

430
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:18,393
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

431
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:23,863
Meera danced with
anklets in her feet.

432
00:37:50,75 --> 00:37:54,696
Hey Arjun, come here.
- Is my job done?

433
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:56,714
I've recommended you.
You're going to be interviewed.

434
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:59,791
I've set everything.
Now don't be nervous.

435
00:38:00,38 --> 00:38:03,925
And make sure you give smart
replies to all his questions.

436
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:05,620
Don't worry at all.

437
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:12,87
Greetings, sir.

438
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:20,660
Are you out of your mind?
Who is this?

439
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:24,217
This is too much. Sir, it is me..

440
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:27,584
I'm Arjun Singh. Son of Bhim Singh.
Grandson of Dashrath Singh.

441
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:31,655
Of Lakhanpur. Intermediate passed!
I topped the exams from the village.

442
00:38:32,33 --> 00:38:34,851
Back home, my grandfather
and I are the most educated.

443
00:38:34,931 --> 00:38:36,151
The rest are uneducated louts.

444
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,910
Before I came to the city,
Grandpa taught me three lessons.

445
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,580
Do not covet another man's money
Do not covet another man's wife.

446
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:45,154
Be loyal to your employer.

447
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:48,17
And don't bow before injustice.

448
00:38:48,97 --> 00:38:51,587
Isn't grandpa right?
- Absolutely right.

449
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:55,266
But now you're in the city.
How about a spattering of English?

450
00:38:56,153 --> 00:39:01,249
In English, I can
leave the English behind!

451
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:05,53
Look, sir. I can talk English, I can
walk English, I can laugh English..

452
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:07,328
..because English is a
very funny language.

453
00:39:07,689 --> 00:39:10,856
Bhairav becomes Barren and
Barren becomes Bhairav..

454
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:12,509
..because their
minds are very narrow.

455
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:14,254
In the year 1979, sir..

456
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:17,442
..when India was playing against
Australia in Melbourne city..

457
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,354
..Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare..

458
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:21,906
..at the crease and Vijay Merchant
told Vijay Hazare look Vijay Hazare..

459
00:39:22,89 --> 00:39:23,784
..this is a very
prestigious match..

460
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,301
..and you should consider
this match very carefully.

461
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:26,523
So, considering the consideration..

462
00:39:26,603 --> 00:39:28,254
..that Vijay Hazare
gave Vijay Merchant.

463
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:31,605
Vijay Merchant told Vijay Hazare
that ultimately we must take a run.

464
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:33,642
When they were striking
the ball on the left side, sir.

465
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:35,414
The consideration became..

466
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:37,331
..into an ultimatum. And ultimately
Vijay Hazare went to Vijay Merchant..

467
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:38,470
Shut up!

468
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,887
Listen to me, sir.
In the year 1979..

469
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:44,176
..when India was
playing against Pakistan..

470
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,268
..in Wankhede stadium in Bombay..

471
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,382
..Wasim Raja and Wasim Bari
they were on the crease.

472
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:49,982
Wasim Bari gave the same
consideration to Wasim Raja.

473
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,247
Wasim Raja told Wasim Bari..

474
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:53,382
..look sir.. this ultimately has
to be added as an consideration..

475
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:54,771
..which I cannot consider.

476
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:56,786
Therefore, the consideration
that you are giving me..

477
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,404
..must be considered
very ultimately.

478
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:01,287
Therefore, the run they were
taking, Wasim Raja told Wasim Bari..

479
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,789
Wasim Bari you take a run and
ultimately both of them ran and..

480
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,852
..considerately, they got out.

481
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:12,359
Your kind comments
on my commentary, sir?

482
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:17,949
What? - He means he'd
like your comments if any?

483
00:40:18,29 --> 00:40:22,788
Not at all. Your English is fine.
And your general knowledge is okay.

484
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,901
Arjun Singh. Son of Bhim Singh.
Grandson of Dashrath Singh.

485
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:27,13
Okay. - May I have the job?

486
00:40:27,93 --> 00:40:30,593
Sure. Now please stand outside.
Let me talk to Bhairav.

487
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:32,285
Hail the motherland.
- Hail the motherland.

488
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,63
Yes, sir. Someone new? A trainee?

489
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:39,814
Okay, sir. I'll show him around.
Okay, thank you.

00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,913

I feel we are made for each other.

493
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:06,390
I feel, I am not thinking wrong.

494
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:08,267
Listen..

495
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:13,283
Ms Poonam, Mr. Ranjit has
sent him for job.. - I know.

496

00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:23,178
Not with standing, I need to
take care of my stomach.

00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:25,885

Every morning?
- Yes.

00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:51,303
People who stay here must be dirty!

What?
- Why change every day?

506
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,827
What do they need fresh
sheets and towels every day?

507

Shall we?

508
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:07,166

who buzz you on this board.

513
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:33,205
And you ask him very politely,
What can I do for you, sir?

514
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:36,714
A buzz. - Here's a buzz. From room 666.

515
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:40,920
Come. I'll show you
how to go about it.

516
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:45,580
I think the man in this room is
like his room number. Come on.

517
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:57,194
What a surprise! I
wanted to meet you!

518
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,409
So I'm here.

519
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,66
And what can I do for you, sir?

520
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,976
So much!

521
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,790
But as of now, keep
standing and let me admire you!

522
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:15,547
Mister, I told you already.
For me, you're just a number.

523
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:17,197
666.

524
00:43:17,496 --> 00:43:20,457
And I work in this hotel.
I don't work for you. Got it!

525
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:23,986
No. Don't go away. I
have a gift for you.

526
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,71
Look at this. Such
a pretty nose ring.

527
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:29,280
Go on. Put it on.

528
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:33,679
I'm sure you have many sisters.
Just like me.

529
00:43:33,963 --> 00:43:36,398
Give it to one of them.
They will thank you.

530
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,5
lf you don't have sisters,
give it to your mother.

531
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:45,911
She will keep blessing you! Till
the day she dies! Understood Mr. 666!

532
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:49,494
Let's go, Ms. Poonam.

533
00:43:51,676 --> 00:43:54,337
You must take good
care of this room.

534
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:58,44
Is it for someone special?
- Someone very special.

535
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:04,482
In fact, the most
special man in this city.

536
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:08,248
And who is he?

537
00:44:09,19 --> 00:44:11,288
Mr. Raja. He owns the hotel.

538
00:44:11,897 --> 00:44:15,517
The owner himself!

539
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:17,870
Am I glad to be of service to him!

540
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,672
I'm going to make this room
the best one in this hotel!

541
00:44:24,347 --> 00:44:27,906
Where does he live?
- Abroad. - Okay.

542
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:29,633
That's him in the photograph.

543
00:44:36,403 --> 00:44:38,971
Greetings Boss!
- Good morning, dear Raja.

544
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:42,752
Good morning, Mr. Mathur.

545
00:44:43,101 --> 00:44:47,701
You're going to win the race
this time too. I'm confident.

546
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:55,34
And I'm sure. No one can beat me.

547
00:44:56,101 --> 00:44:58,575
The medal goes to mummy of course.

548
00:44:58,655 --> 00:44:59,616
Oh, I am sure.

549
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,500
Yes, Mr. Ranjit.

550
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:05,114
You know Rajkumar?
- Very well. He is here.

551
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:08,9
Finish him!
- Done.

552
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:11,695
But, price?
- 500,OOO. - 500,OOO?

553
00:45:11,781 --> 00:45:13,697
Accepted?
- Okay.

554
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:16,208
Okay.
- Did you get it? - Good.

555
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:21,458
You tracked the quarry in no time.
You're a hunter, I say.

556
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:22,484
Thank you, daddy. Thank you.

557
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:30,642
I want to down two birds at a go.
Rajkumar and Ms. Savitri.

558
00:45:30,723 --> 00:45:35,407
Good, good. Very good.
That's like my son.

559
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:40,538
The race is ready to go.

560
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,837
3, 2, 1, go!

561
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:14,596
Why do you want to kill me?

562
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:15,817
Speak!

563
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:20,465
Speak!

564
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:28,654
Who are you? Who sent you? Speak up!

565
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:32,238
The letter..
- Letter?

566
00:47:51,16 --> 00:47:54,800
Who were they Raja
who wanted to kill you?

567
00:47:57,147 --> 00:47:58,930
Uncle Mathur, the answers
to all your questions are here..

568
00:48:00,195 --> 00:48:01,146
..in this letter.

569
00:48:10,832 --> 00:48:11,772
Savitri!

570
00:48:14,865 --> 00:48:18,442
Mr. Mathur, why are you silent?

571
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:25,881
Tell me one thing, can a mother
ever want to kill her own son?

572
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:31,669
You'll be sorry to hear this.
Savitri isn't your mother.

573
00:48:33,38 --> 00:48:33,914
What?

574
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:39,201
Yes Raja. Savitri has fostered you.

575
00:48:41,6 --> 00:48:44,325
Fostered me? Only that?

576
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:47,243
Now I understand it all.

577
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,591
Why are you laughing, Raja?

578
00:48:56,671 --> 00:49:02,606
Uncle Mathur, I want to see the woman
who wants to kill her foster-son.

579
00:49:03,60 --> 00:49:07,428
Please send a telegram soon.
I'm going over.

580
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:12,542
My son is coming back after years.
I need leave. For 2 days.

581
00:49:12,909 --> 00:49:13,958
Give the application to me.

582
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:19,821
It is accepted.
- Thank you.

583
00:49:20,238 --> 00:49:22,589
What are you doing? Hurry up!?
- Okay, ma'am.

584
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:25,240
Nothing must be left wanting.

585
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,947
Everything will be in order.
I'm looking into every detail.

586
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:31,856
Hey, there on the table.

587
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:35,108
Ranjit, check the room once again
before you leave. - Okay, ma'am.

588
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,725
Mother, I don't get this.
You have a palatial house.

589
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:49,504
And your son wants
to live in a hotel?

590
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:54,961
My son is a bit moody.
He's a bit odd.

591
00:49:55,41 --> 00:49:57,559
He'll even go hunting
tigers without a gun!

592
00:49:57,905 --> 00:50:04,521
He loves to eat ice
cream when it's snowing!

593
00:50:04,737 --> 00:50:10,86
Is he kind of eccentric?

594
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:14,397
Not at all. He's slightly moody.
And I thought what if..

595
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:17,493
..he wants to come to the
hotel in the middle of the night?

596
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:20,172
My word!

597
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:25,661
Raja. - Homes are for the homely
types. I'm the footloose type.

598
00:50:26,67 --> 00:50:29,245
Where else but a hotel for me?

599
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:32,909
Raja! My son!

600
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,543
Not too hard, mother.

601
00:50:36,758 --> 00:50:37,893
You could kill me.

602
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,346
What a thing to say!

603
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:44,12
Can a mother's embrace kill?

604
00:50:44,596 --> 00:50:48,174
Everything is adulterated nowadays.

605
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,638
Friendship and even
love is adulterated.

606
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:58,185
What do you mean, Raja?
- Leave it mummy.

607
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,552
You just said I'm moody.

608
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,323
Never mind. I don't
care what people say.

609
00:51:06,865 --> 00:51:08,120
Who are these girls?

610
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:12,520
These? They are my friends.

611
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:14,542
Friends.

612
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:15,955
Yes mummy. Friends.

613
00:51:16,316 --> 00:51:19,116
What's life without friends?

614
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:22,219
I want to live it up.

615
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,524
Who knows when time's up?

616
00:51:25,84 --> 00:51:28,109
A man needs a few friends.
To give him a decent funeral.

617
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:33,899
What are you saying?
What's gotten into you?

618
00:51:34,727 --> 00:51:38,593
You see your mother after years!
And this is what you have to say!

619
00:51:39,656 --> 00:51:45,428
Have you changed so much? Tell me!

620
00:51:46,617 --> 00:51:52,190
I have come home after years!
And you greet me with tears!

621
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:55,536
Never mind all that.
Let's change the subject.

622
00:51:56,33 --> 00:52:01,252
It's my birthday tomorrow. Tomorrow.
The 13th. What an ugly date to be born.

623
00:52:02,296 --> 00:52:06,897
No fault of mine, is it?
Anyway, we must celebrate.

624
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:10,977
Well mummy, what's my birthday gift?

625
00:52:11,58 --> 00:52:15,486
Whatever you want. And
whatever there is, is yours.

626
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:21,431
As long as I am alive. Afterwards,
it's yours.

627
00:52:21,712 --> 00:52:24,15
Raja..
- Hey..

628
00:52:28,772 --> 00:52:31,259
Yes boss?
- Who are you?

629
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:34,469
I'm just an ordinary man.

630
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:38,653
And what do you do?

631
00:52:38,847 --> 00:52:41,139
I'm your loyal servant, sir!

632
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:43,592
Loyal?
- Yes, sir!

633
00:52:43,672 --> 00:52:47,757
What's all this loyalty about?

634
00:52:48,306 --> 00:52:50,631
No loyalties here.

635
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:53,928
This is a selfish world.

636
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:57,874
Given a chance, people will kill.

637
00:52:58,47 --> 00:52:58,836
Right, mummy?

638
00:52:59,42 --> 00:53:02,78
Well Mr. Loyalty, you
can do something for me.

639
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:03,225
Sure sir!

640
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,640
4 bottles of champagne. Chill them.

641
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:14,609
Chill? - Chill! - Chill? - Chill.
- Chilled. - Understood?

642
00:53:16,37 --> 00:53:18,511
Put them in ice.
- Okay, sir.

643
00:53:19,42 --> 00:53:20,524
Well mummy, see you tomorrow.

644
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:25,680
But you were supposed
to be here tomorrow!

645
00:53:26,69 --> 00:53:30,674
Are you in trouble seeing me here
today? Has the atmosphere changed?

646
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:32,663
Yes sir, no sir, I mean sorry sir.

647
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:37,53
And who are you?
- I'm Ranjit. Your manager.

648
00:53:37,399 --> 00:53:39,766
My manager?
- I mean I manage your hotel, sir.

649
00:53:40,814 --> 00:53:42,846
Very smart.
- Thank you, sir.

650
00:53:43,30 --> 00:53:44,717
Manager, do one thing, give the
best suites for my guests here.

651
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:51,190
And the best hospitality.
- Understood sir!

652
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:56,765
Please come.
- Very smart. - Please. - Idiot.

653
00:53:59,204 --> 00:54:02,659
May I say something, madam?

654
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:07,562
I didn't quite understand
the mother-son exchange.

655
00:54:09,432 --> 00:54:12,752
Do you have a mother?
- No.

656
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:18,211
Then you needn't bother.
And mind your own business.

657
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:22,502
My son mustn't have any complaints.

658
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:27,540
Yes ma'am.

659
00:54:28,16 --> 00:54:30,326
Sir, many, many happy
returns of the day. - Thank you.

660
00:54:30,406 --> 00:54:31,416
Please cut the cake.

661
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:36,379
I'm in no hurry. 2 minutes 45
seconds to go before I was born.

662
00:54:37,432 --> 00:54:39,799
It was up in no time. Come on now.

663
00:54:40,26 --> 00:54:42,696
Come.
- You leave, I'll be there.

664
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:57,182
Owner of the dog!
- What did you say?!

665
00:54:57,409 --> 00:54:59,690
I mean, is the dog yours?
- Yes.

666
00:55:00,57 --> 00:55:01,596
This isn't your
dog's birthday party!

667
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:02,923
He's eating the cake!

668
00:55:03,96 --> 00:55:05,723
He has ruined the party!

669
00:55:05,896 --> 00:55:08,971
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Sorry doesn't get the cake back!

670
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:13,712
Why didn't you train
your dog not to eat cake?

671
00:55:14,16 --> 00:55:14,964
Lousy dog!

672
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,903
Manager, whose birthday
is it? Mine? Or the dog's?

673
00:55:19,327 --> 00:55:22,677
It's your birthday sir, but..

674
00:55:22,757 --> 00:55:29,296
But sir it has turned
out to be his death day!

675
00:55:37,34 --> 00:55:37,660
What happened to it?

676
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:41,520
It ate your birthday cake and..

677
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:51,919
You've killed my dog!
The cake is poisoned!

678
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:53,520
No more partying with dogs!

679
00:55:54,526 --> 00:55:57,370
Thank God the dog ate
your cake, otherwise..

680
00:55:58,148 --> 00:56:01,200
Anyway I'll make the
baker close his shop!

681
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,789
I'll ruin his business!
I'll destroy his family!

682
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:04,466
I'll hang him for this!
I'll give him to the police!

683
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:11,810
Manager, the dog is dead now.
Stop barking. - Sorry sir.

684
00:56:12,384 --> 00:56:13,928
Who ordered the cake?

685
00:56:15,326 --> 00:56:17,834
Your mother told me..
I mean I ordered it.

686
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:20,199
You say you manage this hotel?
- Yes, sir.

687
00:56:20,591 --> 00:56:22,781
Brilliant management!
- Thank you, sir.

688
00:56:23,88 --> 00:56:26,601
Shut up.
- Sorry, sir. - Nonsense.

689
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:30,796
Get hold of another cake. And
send it to my room. - Yes, sir.

690
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:34,465
Make sure this one
doesn't go to the dogs.

691
00:56:35,67 --> 00:56:41,234
You will eat it. Before I do.
- No, sir. Yes, sir.

692
00:56:44,212 --> 00:56:47,637
Saw that mummy? I told
you 13th is ominous!

693
00:56:49,628 --> 00:56:51,618
That cake wasn't meant for the dog.

694
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,24
I'm the one who was
supposed to die. Like a dog.

695
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:57,584
Anyway, I'm ready
for any eventuality.

696
00:56:58,201 --> 00:57:01,644
Come on, mother. Cheer up.
It's nothing. Cheers everyone!

697
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:04,75
Let's have fun. The
party continues in my room.

698
00:57:04,155 --> 00:57:06,374
Come on, everyone
into my room. Come on.

699
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,536
Don't weep, mother.

700
00:57:17,197 --> 00:57:23,93
That was a perfect plot. To
kill him. And implicate you.

701
00:57:23,879 --> 00:57:29,663
God willing, I will
never let that happen to you.

702
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:48,600
What do you mean?
- Ma'am it is very clear.

703
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:56,285
Give everything to me
that you've stolen inside.

704
00:57:56,536 --> 00:58:00,169
You mean I'm a thief!
- Worse. You're a pickpocket!

705
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,118
Just give it to me.
Else, I'll thrash you!

706
00:58:03,198 --> 00:58:07,272
Arjun Singh, why are you screaming?
- Sir, this..

707
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:11,989
Look Mr. Raja, your man
was trying to molest you!

708
00:58:12,69 --> 00:58:16,761
What?
- Idiot! How dare you?!

709
00:58:18,815 --> 00:58:20,32
Boss!

710
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:26,156
I'm working for you. And I am loyal.

711
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:30,102
That's why my hands are tied.

712
00:58:30,512 --> 00:58:33,798
Else I could've given
you a fitting reply.

713
00:58:36,47 --> 00:58:38,618
Now how about a sample
of her lady-like virtues?

714
00:58:39,334 --> 00:58:41,875
See her wonders too. Come here.

715
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:47,803
There you see?

716
00:58:50,555 --> 00:58:53,908
These dare-bare dresses conceal..

717
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:58,663
..more than meets the eye!

718
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,418
Are you leaving, Arjun Singh?
- Yes.

719
00:59:14,23 --> 00:59:21,985
What if I won't let you leave?
- No. I won't do this job.

720
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:26,67
Even grandpa hasn't ever slapped me.

721
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:30,514
And you slapped me!
For that disgraced woman!

722
00:59:31,558 --> 00:59:33,277
It was my humanity that
I didn't give a fitting reply..

723
00:59:33,357 --> 00:59:35,421
..otherwise I could
have hit you back too.

724
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:40,114
You cannot appreciate loyalty.

725
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:43,903
Besides, I wouldn't like to
serve a man who has scant respect..

726
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:48,550
..for his mother. - She's not my
mother. She is just my foster-mother.

727
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:52,566
Fostered you? The woman
who has fostered you..

728
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:55,637
..has given you more
than the woman who bore you.

729
00:59:57,296 --> 01:00:01,960
The one who has kept you alive
is the mother who fostered you.

730
01:00:02,756 --> 01:00:07,946
Lord Krishna was born of Devki.
But Yashoda reared him.

731
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:11,274
That's why so much is spoken
of Lord Krishna's foster mother.

732
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:12,973
We are just humans.

733
01:00:13,448 --> 01:00:15,535
She wants to kill me for my money.

734
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:21,395
Will a mother who has given
you this priceless gift of love..

735
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,930
..ever yearn for your riches?

736
01:00:25,406 --> 01:00:30,657
No one else gains from my death.
Who else might want to kill me?

737
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:34,334
Several attempts have been
made on my life already.

738
01:00:35,654 --> 01:00:38,566
Do you remember? That
cake laced with poison.

739
01:00:40,518 --> 01:00:44,21
You don't understand anything.
- Boss!

740
01:00:45,416 --> 01:00:51,612
Boss, I think I'm
beginning to understand.

741
01:00:52,163 --> 01:00:58,211
Where are you going?
- I'm not going anywhere..

742
01:00:59,39 --> 01:01:04,207
..until I have found out
who wants to kill you.

743
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:09,375
Arjun Singh, now onwards,
consider yourself my friend..

744
01:01:10,262 --> 01:01:14,121
..and not an employee.

745
01:01:23,735 --> 01:01:24,651
Hello!

746
01:01:25,62 --> 01:01:26,813
C'mon Ms. Poonam,
I'll drop you home.

747
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:30,533
I don't think I've
forgotten my way home.

748
01:01:30,926 --> 01:01:33,288
Or maybe you want to know?

749
01:01:33,808 --> 01:01:39,628
Nothing like that.
- Then please don't waste my time.

750
01:01:41,227 --> 01:01:43,846
Someone is waiting for me. Get it?

751
01:02:15,45 --> 01:02:17,532
It's about to rain.
Come. Let me drop you home.

752
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:19,299
Not necessary, thank you.

753
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,441
What's unnecessary for you,
might be necessary for me.

754
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,447
Think about me from
your heart sometimes!

755
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:28,679
Mind your language.

756
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:33,13
I can control my language but
how do I control my desires?

757
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,562
Come.
- Hey, let go of her.

758
01:02:40,345 --> 01:02:43,241
Hey, come on.
- Help.

759
01:02:43,923 --> 01:02:47,80
You aren't hurt, are you?
Did he hit you?

760
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:52,544
You should use the stick on him.
- Please! Help Poonam!

761
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:01,209
Rajesh.
- Poonam, Poonam!

762
01:03:01,504 --> 01:03:02,605
Are you all right, Poonam?

763
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,368
I'm fine. Are you all right?

764
01:04:04,22 --> 01:04:07,752
Got you at last!
A ladies' man, are you?

765
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:10,941
You broke the lamp post.

766
01:04:11,21 --> 01:04:12,728
Now municipality people
will apprehend you.

767
01:04:14,595 --> 01:04:15,837
On your feet, you fatso.

768
01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:24,606
Hey, where are you taking that
cart? Want to go there, okay. Go.

769
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:29,179
You've ruined all the oranges.

770
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:35,341
What's this?

771
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:44,821
I see!

772
01:04:44,901 --> 01:04:49,589
Mr. Nathulal! This is
that same nose ring, right!

773
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:55,298
Want me to put it on your nose?

774
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:56,968
Passed out!

775
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:00,863
Come in.
- Please come in.

776
01:05:01,307 --> 01:05:03,890
This is our home.

777
01:05:05,437 --> 01:05:07,307
This is the first time
this gentleman has come home.

778
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:11,599
How about tea and snacks?
- All right, brother.

779
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:13,427
Come.

780
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:17,568
Brother?

781
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:29,924
I should be leaving.

782
01:05:30,5 --> 01:05:32,375
Please stay for tea.

783
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:40,618
I'm quite full. Excuse me.

784
01:05:40,908 --> 01:05:43,600
Please be seated.

785
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:46,248
Please tell Poonam I'll
be here some other time.

786
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:54,475
Why did he leave all of a sudden?

787
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,772
I don't know.

788
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:57,210
But he's a fine gentleman.

789
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,31
Hey, no!

790
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:28,754
lf I am bowled over today,
don't wake me up.

791
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:33,66
lf I slip today, don't pick me up.

792
01:07:33,146 --> 01:07:37,177
lf you do so.

793
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,220
lf you do so, then
you'll be bowled over.

794
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,706
Even you'll slip.

795
01:07:43,786 --> 01:07:51,2
lf I am bowled over today,
don't wake me up.

796
01:08:10,874 --> 01:08:15,372
This rain is unique.

797
01:08:15,452 --> 01:08:19,544
It has rained like
this for the first time.

798
01:08:19,624 --> 01:08:23,948
This rain is unique.

799
01:08:24,29 --> 01:08:28,139
It has rained like
this for the first time.

800
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:32,450
The breeze is
lighting fire in water.

801
01:08:32,635 --> 01:08:36,323
My body is craving.

802
01:08:36,754 --> 01:08:41,13
Your wet body makes
me yearn for you.

803
01:08:41,93 --> 01:08:44,947
I am getting intoxicated.

804
01:08:45,131 --> 01:08:49,965
I don't know where I am.

805
01:08:53,555 --> 01:08:57,750
Don't get me into
senses if I get intoxicated.

806
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,948
Don't get me into
senses if I get intoxicated.

807
01:09:02,28 --> 01:09:06,216
Even if you do so..

808
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:10,486
Even if you do so, then
you'll get intoxicated too.

809
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:18,108
lf I am bowled over today,
don't wake me up.

810
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:52,812
The lightening struck
many times in the sky..

811
01:09:52,892 --> 01:09:57,193
..but this is the first time,
it struck to my heart.

812
01:09:57,273 --> 01:10:01,427
The lightening struck
many times in the sky..

813
01:10:01,507 --> 01:10:05,936
..but this is the first time,
it struck to my heart.

814
01:10:06,16 --> 01:10:14,81
Scared girl, she has come
close to me and has embraced me.

815
01:10:14,498 --> 01:10:18,584
You are enjoying it.

816
01:10:18,664 --> 01:10:22,443
I am very restless.

817
01:10:22,524 --> 01:10:26,783
Beloved, where are
you going stealthily?

818
01:10:31,40 --> 01:10:35,450
Don't explain if I am confused.

819
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:39,781
Don't explain if I am confused.

820
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:43,996
lf you do so..

821
01:10:44,76 --> 01:10:48,303
lf you do so, then
even you'll be confused.

822
01:10:48,383 --> 01:10:55,710
lf I am bowled over today,
don't wake me up.

823
01:11:24,612 --> 01:11:28,826
The clouds are raining liquor.

824
01:11:28,906 --> 01:11:33,111
The breeze is raining youth.

825
01:11:33,191 --> 01:11:37,369
The clouds are raining liquor.

826
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:41,726
The breeze is raining youth.

827
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:45,965
The drops are chiming.
The rain is singing a song.

828
01:11:46,46 --> 01:11:49,893
It is making me yearn.

829
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:54,453
Our hearts united. The
environment became colourful.

830
01:11:54,533 --> 01:11:58,145
You hearts met each other.

831
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:02,513
Whatever had to happen has
happened, why do you fear?

832
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:11,212
Don't save me if I drown.

833
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:15,298
Don't save me if I drown.

834
01:12:15,378 --> 01:12:19,549
lf you do so..

835
01:12:19,721 --> 01:12:23,835
lf you do so, then
even you'll drown.

836
01:12:23,995 --> 01:12:30,218
lf I am bowled over today,
don't wake me up.

837
01:12:30,298 --> 01:12:34,789
lf I slip today,
don't pick me up.

838
01:12:50,298 --> 01:12:53,178
Are you blind? Can't you see?!

839
01:12:55,799 --> 01:12:58,337
Boss!

840
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:01,610
Bravo Arjun Singh, great!

841
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:04,321
Get on with it!

842
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:10,63
After the formalities.

843
01:13:10,459 --> 01:13:11,315
Let me drop you.

844
01:13:11,395 --> 01:13:14,695
No! This trailer is
good enough for us.

845
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,153
Let's go, Poonam.

846
01:13:16,233 --> 01:13:21,815
What a time to go on an inspection!
We are leaving, sir.

847
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,404
Arjun Singh! Arjun Singh!
Arjun Singh!

848
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:28,421
Who is this Arjun Singh?
He's becoming an obstacle!

849
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,59
He has bashed up Devaa!

850
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:34,752
He stopped Rajkumar just when
he was about to eat the cake!

851
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:38,599
He reminds me of Bhim
Singh and his loyalty.

852
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:42,621
Forever trying to
protect Sanyal like a shield!

853
01:13:43,348 --> 01:13:45,207
It's as if Bhim Singh has
been born all over again!

854
01:13:45,485 --> 01:13:48,36
Daddy, please relax.
You need not worry.

855
01:13:48,497 --> 01:13:50,371
I've come up with such a plan..

856
01:13:50,856 --> 01:13:52,818
..that not even Arjun's father
can save Rajkumar!

857
01:13:52,898 --> 01:13:56,1
Keep your plans to yourself!
And pay attention!

858
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:59,857
Just look how
easily I kill Rajkumar!

859
01:14:00,507 --> 01:14:04,320
lf not by the sword,
he will die for love.

860
01:14:04,623 --> 01:14:09,120
I don't understand, daddy.
- There's a beauty.

861
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:13,367
She specializes in seduction.
A honey-trap to death.

862
01:14:14,41 --> 01:14:17,944
What? Another prey?

863
01:14:18,24 --> 01:14:20,262
Not another prey. Another kill.

864
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:25,407
What?
- This one is to be killed.

865
01:14:25,952 --> 01:14:27,725
You mean, finish him.

866
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:32,15
Yes.
- But mummy, we've never done that.

867
01:14:32,95 --> 01:14:33,191
Let's do it now.

868
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:41,979
Don't know why mother..

869
01:14:45,43 --> 01:14:47,657
..every night is a horror for me.

870
01:14:47,952 --> 01:14:52,890
Not to be afraid.
There's always a tomorrow.

871
01:14:54,101 --> 01:14:55,830
Time to get into the act.

872
01:14:59,936 --> 01:15:03,250
Sir, this lady is a
famous cabaret artiste.

873
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,896
Every hotel she has worked in
has turned out to be a winner.

874
01:15:07,238 --> 01:15:10,431
She's coming to us. We're lucky!

875
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:17,210
Here comes a dancing girl who
promises to seduce her audience.

876
01:15:17,538 --> 01:15:20,7
And you say this is lucky for us?
- Yes, sir.

877
01:15:20,87 --> 01:15:21,392
The hell with it!

878
01:15:22,83 --> 01:15:23,670
Do we depend on
dancing girls for luck?

879
01:15:24,474 --> 01:15:29,344
Let her come. Let her dance.
And let her move on.

880
01:15:29,923 --> 01:15:33,99
That was a cheap thing to say.

881
01:15:33,564 --> 01:15:34,379
Go away.

882
01:15:37,356 --> 01:15:38,357
I told you to leave!

883
01:15:38,859 --> 01:15:43,386
Excuse me, sir. But she is here.
- Who is here?

884
01:15:43,927 --> 01:15:47,499
Miss Nisha.
- Is that why you're so effusive?

885
01:15:48,718 --> 01:15:51,896
Please meet her. For once.

886
01:15:52,584 --> 01:15:55,998
You don't seem to understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

887
01:15:56,684 --> 01:16:00,360
A matter of mere formalities, sir.

888
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:04,900
Well all right. I'll deal with your
mere formalities. - Thank you, sir.

889
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:06,765
Give her the flowers.

890
01:16:07,9 --> 01:16:10,226
Not you. You've gone
overboard already.

891
01:16:11,852 --> 01:16:13,199
You.. what's your name?
- Arjun Singh, sir!

892
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:19,56
Yes Arjun Singh. Deliver the
flowers to that dancer. - Okay, sir.

893
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:20,588
And why are you still here?

894
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:23,944
Get me the London call, quick.
- Right. - Hurry up. - Right, sir.

895
01:16:53,254 --> 01:16:55,61
Who are you?
- What?

896
01:16:56,99 --> 01:17:00,933
I'm Arjun Singh. Son of Bhim Singh.
Grandson of Dashrath Singh.

897
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,33
You don't know what you should
do before entering someone's room?

898
01:17:05,113 --> 01:17:06,619
No I don't know what is
to be done before..

899
01:17:06,699 --> 01:17:07,911
..or after entering
someone's rule.

900
01:17:07,992 --> 01:17:09,365
You should knock the door.

901
01:17:11,596 --> 01:17:16,80
Those doors that are
already ajar cannot be knocked.

902
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,439
Besides how could I when
my hands are occupied.

903
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:23,291
What is this?

904
01:17:23,584 --> 01:17:24,936
Bouquet.
- For whom?

905
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:25,781
For you.

906
01:17:25,861 --> 01:17:27,251
From whom?
- The boss.

907
01:17:27,595 --> 01:17:30,632
Doesn't he have any etiquette?

908
01:17:31,134 --> 01:17:33,823
He sends a servant with flowers!

909
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:38,484
Are flowers any less fragrant
because they are sent by a servant?

910
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:40,50
Take it!

911
01:17:40,352 --> 01:17:44,846
It's the whole bunch of them.
People get away with less.

912
01:17:45,308 --> 01:17:48,278
A whole bunch of flowers for you.

913
01:17:49,943 --> 01:17:50,800
Wait.
- Yes.

914
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:56,421
You wait here.
- Yes.

915
01:18:08,589 --> 01:18:10,693
For your boss. From me.

916
01:18:12,74 --> 01:18:13,57
Sure.

917
01:18:13,311 --> 01:18:16,932
Listen..
- Yes. - Give this to him too.

918
01:18:19,312 --> 01:18:20,124
Okay.

919
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:33,717
I see!
- And a letter.

920
01:18:34,80 --> 01:18:36,284
A letter too?
- Letter.

921
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:43,865
After searching for so many years,
I've found this from garden of life..

922
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:46,498
..if you want I'll present..

923
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,749
..a few thorns for you.
With best regards.

924
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:53,980
You sent me what you had.
I'm sending you what I had.

925
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,686
I must say I like this!

926
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,143
Arjun Singh. - Yes boss? -
You just met her, didn't you?

927
01:19:01,789 --> 01:19:09,233
What does she look like? - Sir,
as far as looks are concerned..

928
01:19:10,23 --> 01:19:14,130
..she's just what I thought.
- Just what you thought?

929
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,885
Then she must be pretty.
I'll make sure I see her.

930
01:19:18,525 --> 01:19:20,219
What time is her show?
- At nine.

931
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:21,803
At nine?

932
01:19:29,2 --> 01:19:32,199
Hello. I want to kill you.

933
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,286
I will kill you.

934
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:25,53
Young beloved and
beautiful girlfriend.

935
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:28,503
When they unite, they
fall for each other.

936
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:31,741
Young beloved and
beautiful girlfriend.

937
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:35,34
When they unite, they
fall for each other.

938
01:20:35,284 --> 01:20:38,503
The hunter is here but
prey is already dead.

939
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:41,844
What an injustice is this?

940
01:20:41,925 --> 01:20:45,185
How and when did it happen?

941
01:20:45,351 --> 01:20:49,744
Neither I know nor him.

942
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:54,6
Young beloved and
beautiful girlfriend.

943
01:20:54,86 --> 01:20:58,165
When they unite, they
fall for each other.

944
01:21:35,344 --> 01:21:40,436
Your beloved has come from..

945
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:44,199
..a long distance.

946
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:50,532
Your beloved has..

947
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:53,428
..been depressed.

948
01:21:53,594 --> 01:21:59,72
Their eyes met.

949
01:22:00,237 --> 01:22:06,43
The effect was intoxicating.

950
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:10,128
There eyes met and
everything changed.

951
01:22:10,277 --> 01:22:14,110
I've been hit by my own arrow.

952
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:21,305
How and when did it happen?
Neither I know nor him.

953
01:22:22,142 --> 01:22:25,476
Young beloved and
beautiful girlfriend.

954
01:22:25,556 --> 01:22:28,915
When they unite, they
fall for each other.

955
01:22:29,53 --> 01:22:32,335
The hunter is here but
the prey is already dead.

956
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:38,900
What an injustice is this?

957
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:43,200
How and when did it happen?
Neither I know nor him.

958
01:23:27,162 --> 01:23:32,994
Look, what state you..

959
01:23:33,74 --> 01:23:36,632
..come to in love.

960
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:45,130
Look, what state
you come to in love.

961
01:23:45,427 --> 01:23:50,947
Found a beloved.

962
01:23:52,83 --> 01:23:57,139
What an injustice.

963
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:02,338
Enemy became my beloved.

964
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:06,702
I love the one I used to hate.

965
01:24:07,132 --> 01:24:13,48
How and when did it happen?
Neither I know nor him.

966
01:24:13,975 --> 01:24:20,583
Young beloved and
beautiful girlfriend.

967
01:24:20,824 --> 01:24:24,173
When they unite, they
fall for each other.

968
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:27,424
The hunter is here and
the pre is already dead.

969
01:24:27,504 --> 01:24:30,904
What an injustice is this?

970
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:36,799
How and when did it happen?
Neither I know nor him.

971
01:24:45,393 --> 01:24:48,589
Fabulous!

972
01:24:49,474 --> 01:24:50,540
You sing very well.

973
01:24:52,539 --> 01:24:55,348
I don't want to prolong
this conversation unnecessarily..

974
01:24:55,428 --> 01:24:57,171
..by thanking you.

975
01:24:58,165 --> 01:25:01,555
But the fact is that
I do sing very well.

976
01:25:02,53 --> 01:25:06,443
May I see you to your room?
- No thank you.

977
01:25:07,643 --> 01:25:10,534
That pretext may be used
to get inside my room.

978
01:25:11,814 --> 01:25:13,288
I'm used to living alone.

979
01:25:14,97 --> 01:25:17,244
I feel suffocated when
someone else enters my room.

980
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:21,117
Very well. What are you
doing tomorrow evening?

981
01:25:22,836 --> 01:25:26,310
Do you want to interview me
for a magazine or a newspaper?

982
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:32,951
I was just asking..

983
01:25:34,232 --> 01:25:35,526
It is better if you do not ask.

984
01:25:36,584 --> 01:25:38,240
I'm here to perform.

985
01:25:38,895 --> 01:25:41,25
Not to tell you how I
occupy myself in the evenings.

986
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,795
Before we part.. how about
a good night or something?

987
01:25:49,688 --> 01:25:52,850
I would've wished you if there
was anything good about the night.

988
01:25:55,341 --> 01:25:59,447
Who knows what the night holds?

989
01:26:04,543 --> 01:26:10,914
Boss! Maybe you need this?
- You.. - Take this, sir.

990
01:26:11,828 --> 01:26:14,648
Arjun..
- Come, sir. Come.

991
01:26:17,4 --> 01:26:20,68
One minute. One minute. Move back.

992
01:26:22,27 --> 01:26:24,80
Open sesame!

993
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:33,569
Come. Careful. One minute.

994
01:26:36,126 --> 01:26:38,860
Close sesame!

995
01:26:43,668 --> 01:26:44,647
Let's go, sir.

996
01:26:47,992 --> 01:26:49,840
Arjun Singh, did you see that?

997
01:26:50,47 --> 01:26:54,221
I saw it all. And what I saw
is more than what meets the eye!

998
01:26:54,869 --> 01:26:57,290
Such grace!
- That is what I'm saying!

999
01:26:57,603 --> 01:26:59,671
Such poise!
- That is what I'm saying!

1000
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:01,540
Brilliant danseuse!
- That is what I'm saying!

1001
01:27:01,621 --> 01:27:04,612
What?
- Hey.. - Yes.

1002
01:27:04,938 --> 01:27:08,487
lf you're the one who says all that,
I'll have very little else to say!

1003
01:27:09,144 --> 01:27:11,311
That is what I'm saying, sir!
- What?!

1004
01:27:11,684 --> 01:27:14,310
I'm saying what you said and
you are saying what I said!

1005
01:27:15,137 --> 01:27:16,308
Yes?
- Yes!

1006
01:27:17,627 --> 01:27:18,49
Yes!

1007
01:27:22,684 --> 01:27:26,316
Beautiful. Good decoration. Good..

1008
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:28,846
Good food,
marvelous, beautiful hotel.

1009
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:34,937
Good evening sir. - I want a
room that's as beautiful as you are.

1010
01:27:35,657 --> 01:27:37,347
Excuse me sir, do you
have a reservation, sir?

1011
01:27:37,427 --> 01:27:39,16
Grandpa!

1012
01:27:39,96 --> 01:27:41,262
Hey, my grandpa.

1013
01:27:41,342 --> 01:27:43,206
Hey, who are you?
- How did you come here, grandpa?

1014
01:27:43,287 --> 01:27:44,264
My grandpa is here!

1015
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:46,676
My grandpa is here!

1016
01:27:46,756 --> 01:27:48,71
My grandpa is here!

1017
01:27:48,151 --> 01:27:50,202
Hey move, move! What are you doing?

1018
01:27:50,355 --> 01:27:53,25
Grabbing my feet
and grabbing my neck!

1019
01:27:53,317 --> 01:27:57,226
Sweety, is this the way you greet
your guests who come to your hotel?

1020
01:27:57,306 --> 01:27:59,101
Only he embraces and not some girl?

1021
01:27:59,246 --> 01:27:59,744
Sorry sir,.

1022
01:27:59,882 --> 01:28:00,596
Arjun, what are you doing?

1023
01:28:00,852 --> 01:28:04,90
Grandpa! It's me! It's me! It's me!

1024
01:28:04,345 --> 01:28:05,840
That I can see.

1025
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,913
It is you! It is you! You!

1026
01:28:08,126 --> 01:28:10,497
But the question is
who the hell are you?

1027
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:12,229
I am your grandson, grandpa.

1028
01:28:12,309 --> 01:28:14,441
Grandson! What's this now?

1029
01:28:14,578 --> 01:28:16,915
Never mind. What
happened to your big moustache?

1030
01:28:16,995 --> 01:28:20,777
Next you'll ask me
what happens to my tail!

1031
01:28:20,857 --> 01:28:23,176
Stop joking. Now where are you
coming from? From the village?

1032
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:26,298
Village. Oh! You mean village.

1033
01:28:26,378 --> 01:28:28,615
Oh idiot, where are your spectacles?

1034
01:28:28,695 --> 01:28:30,237
Do I look like I'm
coming from a village?

1035
01:28:30,317 --> 01:28:31,784
Does my luggage look
like it is from village?

1036
01:28:31,864 --> 01:28:35,172
I am coming to India all the way
from France, Japan, and Italy.

1037
01:28:35,252 --> 01:28:36,611
Now get lost.

1038
01:28:36,827 --> 01:28:40,690
Sweety, I called you from
Delhi asking for a reservation.

1039
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,987
Enough is enough, grandpa.
It's too much now. Stop joking.

1040
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:48,177
Let go of me! Are you drunk?
Crazy guy, making a scene here.

1041
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:50,388
Stop it, Arjun! Now
don't create a scene.

1042
01:28:50,468 --> 01:28:53,206
He's the one who
is creating a scene!

1043
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:55,571
He dyes his hair and he wears a suit
and he pretends to be someone else!

1044
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:58,151
But he's really my grandfather!
- I'm nobody's grandfather!

1045
01:28:58,231 --> 01:28:59,389
What grandfather? Whose grandfather?

1046
01:28:59,469 --> 01:29:02,150
Neither am I your
grandfather nor anyone else's.

1047
01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:04,425
Is that clear?

1048
01:29:04,745 --> 01:29:05,885
Excuse me sir! Your name please!

1049
01:29:06,53 --> 01:29:08,281
Dashrath Singh. Son
of Sankata Prasad.

1050
01:29:08,361 --> 01:29:15,85
I'm no Prasad. I have not come here
from a temple. Take my name down.

1051
01:29:15,282 --> 01:29:20,699
San Francisco Albert
Contino D'costa Rodrigo.

1052
01:29:23,349 --> 01:29:25,896
Here you are, sir. Room number 616.

1053
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:30,61
Arjun, he's your guest.
Take his luggage.

1054
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:33,376
It means, he will be on
the same floor where I am.

1055
01:29:34,143 --> 01:29:36,431
Oh mister, this is the last warning.

1056
01:29:36,592 --> 01:29:42,52
Don't you ever call me
grandpa again. Get it?

1057
01:29:42,481 --> 01:29:44,313
I get it, sir. I get it.

1058
01:29:49,608 --> 01:29:51,386
Oh Sweety!

1059
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:56,436
Bye, bye. Bye.
- Bye.

1060
01:29:57,835 --> 01:29:59,484
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you.

1061
01:30:02,858 --> 01:30:04,664
This is your room. Your
bedroom is over there.

1062
01:30:04,802 --> 01:30:05,916
I'll get your luggage.

1063
01:30:05,997 --> 01:30:07,473
Thank you. Very good.

1064
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,767
Radio.

1065
01:30:08,953 --> 01:30:10,206
Good, good.

1066
01:30:18,924 --> 01:30:19,796
Keep it there.

1067
01:30:26,626 --> 01:30:31,537
Sir. Sir, what are you doing?
You might get a slip disc.

1068
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:37,135
Who me? But the
girls just love my style!

1069
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:43,342
But your music is third class.
Not worth a jive.

1070
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:45,133
Please check your
Luggage and let me leave.

1071
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:50,177
I haven't ever counted my millions.
And you want me to check my luggage?

1072
01:30:50,426 --> 01:30:52,48
As you please, sir.
- Listen.

1073
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,850
What is it grandpa?

1074
01:30:54,30 --> 01:30:54,874
Sorry.

1075
01:30:54,954 --> 01:30:59,53
What's on the menu? - Punjabi
rolls. Kashmiri flavoured rice.

1076
01:30:59,207 --> 01:31:00,189
South Indian dishes.
- What a shame!

1077
01:31:00,269 --> 01:31:05,332
And Shammi Kebabs a from Lucknow.
- I don't want that junk.

1078
01:31:05,412 --> 01:31:07,595
I want inter-continental dishes.

1079
01:31:07,675 --> 01:31:09,756
So that..

1080
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:14,519
Please use your phone.

1081
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:19,429
Dial 3. For room service.
Please ask for anything you want.

1082
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:23,23
Listen.
- Yes?

1083
01:31:23,566 --> 01:31:27,68
What about something to drink?
- Tea, coffee and yogurt-shake.

1084
01:31:27,216 --> 01:31:29,739
Yogurt-shakes are meant
for doddering old men!

1085
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:31,480
I want something for
the younger generation!

1086
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:33,59
Whiskey, rum, gin!

1087
01:31:33,139 --> 01:31:34,830
Call the police station
for doorstep deliveries.

1088
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:38,104
Police station?
- I mean the bar. - Listen.

1089
01:31:41,415 --> 01:31:42,187
Yes.

1090
01:31:44,146 --> 01:31:45,722
What about the other thing?

1091
01:31:48,548 --> 01:31:49,587
What?

1092
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:54,75
The other thing!
- Which thing? Who?

1093
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,254
This!

1094
01:31:56,359 --> 01:31:59,654
You mean snuff? It's available
at the tobacconists' downstairs.

1095
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:01,284
I'll have it sent up.
- Listen!

1096
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:07,870
I don't need old age stuff.
What I need is a young girl.

1097
01:32:09,421 --> 01:32:10,254
Girl?
- Yes.

1098
01:32:11,157 --> 01:32:12,528
You want a girl?
- Yes.

1099
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:16,976
Feel ashamed. Look at you!
You want a girl!

1100
01:32:17,56 --> 01:32:18,374
I'm about as old as your grandson!
And you're old enough..

1101
01:32:18,454 --> 01:32:19,833
..to be my grandfather!
- Not again!

1102
01:32:20,124 --> 01:32:22,545
How many times have I told you
not to mention your grandfather!

1103
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:26,391
And I won't! I won't bring
my grandfather to shame!

1104
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:29,549
My grandfather is a million
times better than you are!

1105
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:30,696
Shut up!
- You shut up!

1106
01:32:30,776 --> 01:32:34,404
I care two hoots for the likes
of you! Get it you old fool?

1107
01:32:34,484 --> 01:32:37,392
Old fool?
- Yes! A drunken old fool!

1108
01:32:37,472 --> 01:32:40,1
You're just a
dirty old man! Old man!

1109
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:42,921
You could never be my
grandfather you lousy old fool!

1110
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:48,650
Wait.

1111
01:32:51,9 --> 01:32:52,279
Wait.

1112
01:32:52,871 --> 01:32:57,717
Knocking at 3 a.m. Is
this a hotel or hermitage?

1113
01:32:59,644 --> 01:33:00,394
Wait.

1114
01:33:03,891 --> 01:33:08,858
It's 3 a.m. Is this any time
to come knocking? What is it?

1115
01:33:11,876 --> 01:33:13,545
You can't be my grandfather.

1116
01:33:15,785 --> 01:33:17,79
Yes, it is me.

1117
01:33:17,438 --> 01:33:19,756
No. Please don't take any action.
I'll be up directly.

1118
01:33:21,915 --> 01:33:22,904
Sir, I am really sorry.

1119
01:33:23,102 --> 01:33:26,891
I apologize on Arjun's behalf
if he has given you any trouble.

1120
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:28,839
No! Call the manager! The manager!

1121
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,705
lf you complain against him,
he will be fired.

1122
01:33:31,785 --> 01:33:36,22
He deserves to be fired!
- Please! Arjun is a very nice man.

1123
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:40,972
lf you stay here for a few days,
you too will begin to like him.

1124
01:33:42,393 --> 01:33:43,87
You too!

1125
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:47,155
What do you mean by 'too?'

1126
01:33:47,806 --> 01:33:51,874
I mean you will have a
soft corner for him.

1127
01:33:53,902 --> 01:33:56,331
So you have a soft
corner for him 'too?'

1128
01:33:56,566 --> 01:33:57,673
Yes, I mean no.

1129
01:33:58,593 --> 01:34:01,769
But he's very sympathetic.
No one can dislike him.

1130
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:10,209
Who can dislike someone who
is upright and loyal? Right?

1131
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:14,599
So who do you have at home?

1132
01:34:14,973 --> 01:34:18,19
My brother and I. He's blind.

1133
01:34:20,162 --> 01:34:22,686
And you take care of your brother?

1134
01:34:23,54 --> 01:34:27,19
Who else is there? And women
are born to care for others.

1135
01:34:28,465 --> 01:34:31,868
My work is done. Wonderful.

1136
01:34:32,27 --> 01:34:37,426
I'll tell my grandson I want him
to find a girl who's just like you!

1137
01:34:37,506 --> 01:34:43,716
lf he marries anyone else,
I'll beat him very badly!

1138
01:34:43,796 --> 01:34:45,404
Thank you, dear. You can go.

1139
01:34:45,484 --> 01:34:48,21
I won't complain
against that tall man.

1140
01:34:48,586 --> 01:34:50,52
Thank you so much, sir.

1141
01:34:50,759 --> 01:34:52,261
Listen.
- Yes.

1142
01:34:59,602 --> 01:35:00,681
God bless you!

1143
01:35:02,735 --> 01:35:03,772
Thank you, sir.

1144
01:35:07,987 --> 01:35:08,901
Good morning, sir.

1145
01:35:10,366 --> 01:35:12,562
Where's that tallish captain?

1146
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:14,311
You mean Arjun Singh?
- Yes.

1147
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:15,987
It's his birthday today.

1148
01:35:16,883 --> 01:35:17,907
Birthday?

1149
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:24,874
But how can it be his birthday?
- It is. He's celebrating.

1150
01:35:24,954 --> 01:35:27,125
Where?
- In the staff quarters.

1151
01:35:27,314 --> 01:35:28,664
I see. You may leave.

1152
01:35:33,532 --> 01:35:37,59
Where does Arjun Singh live?
- You want a drink?

1153
01:35:39,252 --> 01:35:43,371
I am asking you, where does
Arjun Singh live? - The girls?

1154
01:35:43,451 --> 01:35:45,491
They are in there. With Arjun.

1155
01:35:46,113 --> 01:35:47,226
Are you invited too?

1156
01:35:47,306 --> 01:35:48,455
Shut up!

1157
01:35:48,596 --> 01:35:50,920
Julie! I've warned you!

1158
01:35:51,1 --> 01:35:55,79
To love me and enjoy..

1159
01:35:55,273 --> 01:35:56,795
..but don't become pregnant!

1160
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:59,377
Why the hell are you pregnant?

1161
01:35:59,457 --> 01:36:01,798
What's going to happen to me?
You'll marry me, won't you?

1162
01:36:02,61 --> 01:36:04,172
Marry! Marry! Marry!

1163
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:09,977
Get this clear! As long as
that grandpa of mine is alive..

1164
01:36:10,57 --> 01:36:13,160
..I can never marry one of you!

1165
01:36:13,547 --> 01:36:20,605
Just wait for him to die.
I'll inherit his property.

1166
01:36:20,685 --> 01:36:22,903
And then I'll sell the land.

1167
01:36:22,983 --> 01:36:25,441
And build a four-storied house
with the money. For you girls!

1168
01:36:25,635 --> 01:36:29,640
The first floor is for Julie.
The second floor is for Rano.

1169
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,920
The third floor is Sheela's.
The fourth is for Jawano!

1170
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,671
And the ground floor
is going to be mine!

1171
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:39,122
Everything in the house
is going to be automatic!

1172
01:36:39,305 --> 01:36:41,78
And we'll have fun!

1173
01:36:41,158 --> 01:36:44,918
Just wait for that old fool to die!

1174
01:36:46,39 --> 01:36:49,248
What's the guarantee that he'll die?

1175
01:36:50,267 --> 01:36:52,199
Full guarantee!

1176
01:36:52,834 --> 01:36:59,751
What if he still doesn't die?
- He will! For sure he will!

1177
01:36:59,903 --> 01:37:01,120
He will surely die.

1178
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:05,285
I have faith in God! Trust in me.

1179
01:37:05,432 --> 01:37:08,318
Grandpa has never
denied me anything.

1180
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:11,838
And you girls choose this
day to pick a fight with me!

1181
01:37:12,25 --> 01:37:15,830
Have you forgotten
that today is my birthday!

1182
01:37:15,911 --> 01:37:18,711
You mean, birthday?
- Yes, it is my birthday.

1183
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:20,719
Happy birthday.
- It is my birthday.

1184
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:22,733
Happy birthday.

1185
01:37:22,813 --> 01:37:24,119
Thank you.

1186
01:37:25,928 --> 01:37:29,574
You aren't going to drink tonight.
- Why not?

1187
01:37:29,796 --> 01:37:32,604
I'm going to get drunk
and make others drink too.

1188
01:37:32,756 --> 01:37:37,232
Julie! Get the bottle!
Sheela! The soda!

1189
01:37:37,385 --> 01:37:42,387
Rano! Fetch water.
And Jamalo! The ice!

1190
01:37:42,467 --> 01:37:43,496
Quick!

1191
01:37:46,423 --> 01:37:48,809
Bobby!
- Yes, ma'am.

1192
01:37:49,10 --> 01:37:50,435
Whisky!
- Soda!

1193
01:37:50,515 --> 01:37:52,13
Water!
- Ice!

1194
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,462
On the double!
- Coming up!

1195
01:37:56,933 --> 01:37:58,646
Listen.
- Yes.

1196
01:37:59,105 --> 01:38:04,4
On a man's birthday, you
have to feed him fruit..

1197
01:38:04,170 --> 01:38:06,841
..butter and buttermilk.

1198
01:38:07,56 --> 01:38:08,927
Why whisky?

1199
01:38:10,371 --> 01:38:11,490
Oh I forgot!

1200
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:12,908
I'll get it right now.

1201
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:22,734
I am just drunk a bit.
Haven't done any crime.

1202
01:39:26,843 --> 01:39:34,398
I am just drunk a bit.
Haven't done any crime.

1203
01:39:34,478 --> 01:39:40,529
O Julie, O Sheila, O Rano, Jamalo.
Somebody stop me and support me.

1204
01:39:40,609 --> 01:39:45,73
See that I don't fall.

1205
01:39:46,92 --> 01:39:53,732
I am just drunk a bit.
Haven't done any crime.

1206
01:39:54,140 --> 01:40:01,665
O Julie, O Sheila, O Rano, Jamalo.
Somebody stop me and support me.

1207
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:04,683
See that I don't fall.

1208
01:40:05,343 --> 01:40:13,208
I am just drunk a bit.
Haven't done any crime.

1209
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:59,467
I too know that drinking is bad.

1210
01:40:59,751 --> 01:41:03,625
Why shouldn't I,
this night is exotic?

1211
01:41:07,483 --> 01:41:10,910
I too know that drinking is bad.

1212
01:41:11,374 --> 01:41:14,840
Why shouldn't I,
this night is exotic?

1213
01:41:15,352 --> 01:41:20,575
When surrounded
by beautiful girls.

1214
01:41:20,797 --> 01:41:28,446
O Julie, O Sheila, O Rano, Jamalo.
Somebody stop me and support me.

1215
01:41:28,527 --> 01:41:31,334
See that I don't fall.

1216
01:41:31,846 --> 01:41:39,553
I am just drunk a bit.
Haven't done any crime.

1217
01:42:14,349 --> 01:42:17,962
My ways are different
from that of the world.

1218
01:42:18,155 --> 01:42:21,987
I have nothing to
do with this world.

1219
01:42:25,797 --> 01:42:29,284
My ways are different
from that of the world.

1220
01:42:29,674 --> 01:42:33,171
I have nothing to
do with this world.

1221
01:42:33,839 --> 01:42:38,835
Don't know why
people are angry with me.

1222
01:42:38,915 --> 01:42:46,382
O Julie, O Sheila, O Rano, Jamalo.
Somebody stop me and support me.

1223
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:48,976
See that I don't fall.

1224
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:53,459
I am just drunk a bit.

1225
01:42:53,675 --> 01:42:57,887
Haven't done any crime.

1226
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:17,900
I am done for.

1227
01:43:35,135 --> 01:43:38,325
Little intoxicated by your youth.

1228
01:43:38,878 --> 01:43:42,407
Besides intoxication of your love.

1229
01:43:46,469 --> 01:43:50,5
Little intoxicated by your youth.

1230
01:43:50,382 --> 01:43:53,679
Besides intoxication of your love.

1231
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:59,236
This intoxication
has taken me high.

1232
01:43:59,395 --> 01:44:06,750
Don't stare at me
and make me restless.

1233
01:44:06,889 --> 01:44:09,233
See that I don't fall.

1234
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:17,453
I am just drunk a bit.
Haven't done any crime.

1235
01:44:17,862 --> 01:44:25,528
Beloved, listen to me,
don't get angry. Come embrace.

1236
01:44:27,251 --> 01:44:31,562
See that I don't fall.

1237
01:44:34,222 --> 01:44:37,420
I've fallen.

1238
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:44,424
Listen.

1239
01:44:46,594 --> 01:44:50,153
Julie.
- Hi Arjun! Happy birthday.

1240
01:44:50,429 --> 01:44:51,612
I came uninvited.

1241
01:44:51,913 --> 01:44:54,317
It was your birthday and you
didn't invite me, did you?

1242
01:44:54,629 --> 01:44:56,573
Not really my birthday.

1243
01:44:56,767 --> 01:45:00,766
As of now, was celebrating my
birthday and now it's my funeral.

1244
01:45:01,157 --> 01:45:03,581
Everything kind of misfired.

1245
01:45:04,45 --> 01:45:08,2
It's love, it's a bit
painful in the beginning.

1246
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:10,326
And afterwards?

1247
01:45:10,993 --> 01:45:12,242
It's worse.

1248
01:45:14,152 --> 01:45:16,937
Why are you weeping?
Arjun just put up that act.

1249
01:45:18,125 --> 01:45:19,264
Just an act?

1250
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:24,921
He was singing and dancing with
them! And you say it's an act?

1251
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:28,169
That's just what it was. For me.

1252
01:45:28,487 --> 01:45:30,874
To irritate me.
To draw me out in the open.

1253
01:45:33,257 --> 01:45:34,190
In the open?

1254
01:45:36,104 --> 01:45:41,874
I've been putting up an act.
As Alberto D'costa Rodriguez.

1255
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:47,978
I'm no Alberto etc. I'm his grandpa.

1256
01:45:49,16 --> 01:45:49,728
Grandpa?

1257
01:45:51,147 --> 01:45:52,359
I'm his grandfather.

1258
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:57,28
For him, I am a mother.
And a father.

1259
01:45:58,184 --> 01:46:02,937
I mean everything to him. And he's
my sole support. The apple of my eye.

1260
01:46:03,635 --> 01:46:05,74
I love him so!

1261
01:46:05,234 --> 01:46:08,299
Then why did you do all this?

1262
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:15,503
He is very innocent. He
doesn't know the ways of the world.

1263
01:46:16,491 --> 01:46:18,570
I wanted him to see
what the world is like.

1264
01:46:19,576 --> 01:46:22,170
I wanted him to stand on his feet.

1265
01:46:23,319 --> 01:46:25,561
As between us, we can't
live without each other.

1266
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:31,31
But life teaches otherwise.
In the end, we always part.

1267
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:33,477
How long can I possibly live?

1268
01:46:35,311 --> 01:46:37,786
But now I know that my boy has
learnt the ways of the world.

1269
01:46:38,106 --> 01:46:41,831
He is able enough.

1270
01:46:42,651 --> 01:46:46,346
All I want to do is take
him back to the village.

1271
01:46:46,782 --> 01:46:49,744
I'll give you a grand marriage!

1272
01:46:50,961 --> 01:46:53,27
The house feels so empty.

1273
01:46:53,535 --> 01:46:55,977
With you and Arjun around,
things will be livelier.

1274
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,306
God bless you!

1275
01:46:57,386 --> 01:46:59,465
Ms. Poonam..
- Yes.

1276
01:46:59,624 --> 01:47:00,760
That tallish man who
works in your hotel..

1277
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:02,358
Yes. What is it?
- He has been run over by a bus.

1278
01:47:02,575 --> 01:47:03,540
My boy!

1279
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:04,710
My boy!

1280
01:47:11,455 --> 01:47:13,898
Tears in your eyes, sir?

1281
01:47:14,589 --> 01:47:21,237
Look son, play any joke. Not this.
Not this joke with an old man!

1282
01:47:21,403 --> 01:47:28,41
But you aren't old! You're young,
Mr. Albert D'costa Rodriguez!

1283
01:47:28,801 --> 01:47:31,901
And what are you doing in here?
Just sauntered in, have you?

1284
01:47:32,102 --> 01:47:38,32
You know what my grandpa says?
Two men can't share one woman.

1285
01:47:38,447 --> 01:47:41,415
It's either Mr.
D'costa or I. Choose.

1286
01:47:41,706 --> 01:47:44,677
Aren't you ashamed to talk like
this in front of your grandfather?!

1287
01:47:44,757 --> 01:47:50,337
What grandfather? Whose grandfather?
What's this about your grandfather?

1288
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:55,513
All right. You win. I lose.

1289
01:47:57,160 --> 01:48:01,215
San Francisco Albert Coutinho
D'costa Rodriguez? Or aren't you?

1290
01:48:01,700 --> 01:48:04,378
He's dead! Run over by your bus.

1291
01:48:05,193 --> 01:48:06,508
I'm your grandpa!

1292
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:07,733
What about whisky?

1293
01:48:08,65 --> 01:48:09,973
I've never sipped
a drink in my life!

1294
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:13,240
I was drinking sacred
water by mixing color in it.

1295
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:18,430
Dear, this old man has
been suffering within.

1296
01:48:19,60 --> 01:48:23,87
Come to me, son. Let me embrace you.

1297
01:48:23,167 --> 01:48:25,833
For once! Let me embrace you!

1298
01:48:27,958 --> 01:48:28,995
Grandpa!

1299
01:48:31,549 --> 01:48:34,834
Did you ever think of
the quandary I was in?

1300
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,762
You walk into that hotel
and you start asking..

1301
01:48:37,842 --> 01:48:41,62
..for whisky, you ask me for girls!
And all night I didn't sleep!

1302
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:44,472
I was so disturbed!

1303
01:48:46,63 --> 01:48:51,542
Back home, every time I had a cold,
you'd call all the doctors!

1304
01:48:52,546 --> 01:48:54,109
Everyone in the
village used to be worked up!

1305
01:48:54,445 --> 01:48:55,894
My dear!

1306
01:48:56,614 --> 01:49:00,239
And you come here, and you
don't even ask about my welfare!

1307
01:49:03,34 --> 01:49:04,509
That's when I swore it.

1308
01:49:05,265 --> 01:49:09,679
lf you're the grandpa, then
I'm the grandson! No less!

1309
01:49:12,56 --> 01:49:16,309
I took it as a challenge to
bring you out in the open.

1310
01:49:21,307 --> 01:49:22,802
You've made me feel
so miserable, grandpa!

1311
01:49:23,549 --> 01:49:24,636
You've made me cry.

1312
01:49:30,67 --> 01:49:34,446
So that you won't be
miserable ever again!

1313
01:49:36,315 --> 01:49:40,942
Let's go back home now.
I came here empty-handed.

1314
01:49:41,594 --> 01:49:45,614
I'm going back with
my grandson's bride!

1315
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:47,507
Not now.

1316
01:49:47,587 --> 01:49:49,38
Why not?

1317
01:49:50,373 --> 01:49:53,132
You told me that I must be loyal.

1318
01:49:54,137 --> 01:49:55,822
My boss is in danger.

1319
01:49:56,330 --> 01:49:59,572
I can't go back till
I have repaid him.

1320
01:50:00,53 --> 01:50:02,364
lf that be the case,
then I'm with you!

1321
01:50:10,221 --> 01:50:13,523
Mummy!
- Take her mother away.

1322
01:50:17,393 --> 01:50:19,890
You see, the matter
is out of your hand.

1323
01:50:20,323 --> 01:50:22,182
There's no going back now.

1324
01:50:22,766 --> 01:50:24,333
Do what I want you to do.

1325
01:50:24,545 --> 01:50:26,42
I'll let her go.

1326
01:50:26,496 --> 01:50:28,63
Else she dies.

1327
01:50:28,378 --> 01:50:30,31
Raja dies too.

1328
01:50:30,111 --> 01:50:32,64
And you're going to be framed.

1329
01:50:32,329 --> 01:50:34,409
So what do you think?

1330
01:50:36,265 --> 01:50:37,323
Good.

1331
01:50:38,53 --> 01:50:40,931
Greetings, miss Nisha!

1332
01:50:41,275 --> 01:50:43,47
Mr. Raja sends you this bouquet.

1333
01:50:43,501 --> 01:50:44,572
Didn't he come along?

1334
01:50:44,652 --> 01:50:45,859
No, Mr. Raja is
running a temperature..

1335
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:48,462
..401 degrees. So, he couldn't come.
- 401 ?!

1336
01:50:48,984 --> 01:50:50,390
I meant 104. 104!

1337
01:50:53,222 --> 01:50:56,584
What is the matter? You look sad?

1338
01:50:57,423 --> 01:51:01,968
Does Mr. Raja's
absence spoil your party?

1339
01:51:02,303 --> 01:51:04,726
I mean, look at this.
Such a grand party!

1340
01:51:05,28 --> 01:51:10,574
It's all a waste, is it?
- Not at all. The party goes on.

1341
01:51:10,833 --> 01:51:12,790
What does Mr. Raja
think of himself?!

1342
01:51:13,233 --> 01:51:16,363
So what if he's rich? He's
is flying in the fifth heaven!

1343
01:51:16,575 --> 01:51:19,929
Ms. Nisha, it is actually the
seventh heaven. - Shut up, please.

1344
01:51:20,153 --> 01:51:23,62
Now don't lose your temper.
He's just joking.

1345
01:51:23,483 --> 01:51:26,402
How could I not come?
You invited me!

1346
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:29,712
For you, I'd walk out of my grave!

1347
01:51:30,728 --> 01:51:33,506
Have you had your say?
Anything else?

1348
01:51:33,787 --> 01:51:37,603
The hangman would talk like that.
Asking for a last wish.

1349
01:51:38,122 --> 01:51:41,517
Lots more. There's more to life!

1350
01:51:41,597 --> 01:51:42,902
Then there is death.

1351
01:51:43,138 --> 01:51:45,73
I have a lot to say!
And a lot to hear!

1352
01:51:47,182 --> 01:51:48,45
But now..

1353
01:51:48,126 --> 01:51:49,334
Well what?

1354
01:51:54,848 --> 01:51:58,105
The night is still alive..

1355
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:04,198
..and so is our conversation.

1356
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:15,192
Let anything happen.

1357
01:52:58,437 --> 01:53:04,512
The night is still alive
and so is our conversation.

1358
01:53:04,592 --> 01:53:10,956
Let anything happen.

1359
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:16,92
Don't think, just see.

1360
01:53:16,172 --> 01:53:21,558
Beloved, just
look at me with love.

1361
01:53:23,303 --> 01:53:33,163
Don't think, just see.
Beloved, just look at me with love.

1362
01:53:33,768 --> 01:53:37,18
The night is still alive..

1363
01:53:37,374 --> 01:53:40,173
..and so is our conversation.

1364
01:53:40,253 --> 01:53:47,93
Let anything happen.

1365
01:54:43,388 --> 01:54:48,486
Heart, full of desires
struggles to contain its emotions.

1366
01:54:50,372 --> 01:54:55,713
The destination
of love is nearing.

1367
01:54:57,626 --> 01:55:02,620
Heart, full of desires
struggles to contain its emotions.

1368
01:55:02,847 --> 01:55:07,723
The destination
of love is nearing.

1369
01:55:10,18 --> 01:55:13,491
Come, see..

1370
01:55:13,664 --> 01:55:16,536
..the fun of..

1371
01:55:16,617 --> 01:55:20,37
..losing your heart in love.

1372
01:55:20,630 --> 01:55:24,177
The night is still alive..

1373
01:55:24,257 --> 01:55:27,27
..and so is our conversation.

1374
01:55:27,108 --> 01:55:33,284
Let anything happen.

1375
01:55:34,959 --> 01:55:38,376
Don't think, just see.

1376
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:45,404
Beloved, just
Look at me with love.

1377
01:56:29,664 --> 01:56:31,144
No!

1378
01:56:31,475 --> 01:56:33,91
I won't let Raja die!

1379
01:56:34,518 --> 01:56:37,680
Whom? What happened to you?

1380
01:56:39,610 --> 01:56:41,402
You're sweating.

1381
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,165
Whose death is it?

1382
01:56:44,681 --> 01:56:47,633
Mine? My life and my
death are in your hands.

1383
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:51,276
People in love
aren't afraid of death.

1384
01:57:11,245 --> 01:57:16,693
The beginning is so beautiful,
why fear the result.

1385
01:57:18,545 --> 01:57:23,591
Lovers don't fear death.

1386
01:57:25,536 --> 01:57:30,426
The beginning is so beautiful,
why fear the result.

1387
01:57:30,757 --> 01:57:35,763
Lovers don't fear death.

1388
01:57:37,861 --> 01:57:40,758
Come, beloved..

1389
01:57:41,727 --> 01:57:47,382
..embrace your lover.

1390
01:57:48,477 --> 01:57:51,503
The night is still alive..

1391
01:57:52,228 --> 01:57:54,606
.. and so is our conversation.

1392
01:57:54,779 --> 01:58:00,881
Let anything happen.

1393
01:58:02,564 --> 01:58:04,607
Don't think, just see.

1394
01:58:04,687 --> 01:58:12,554
Beloved, just
Look at me with love.

1395
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:16,692
Don't think, just see.

1396
01:58:16,910 --> 01:58:22,559
Beloved, just
Look at me with love.

1397
01:58:24,248 --> 01:58:27,334
The night is still alive..

1398
01:58:27,550 --> 01:58:30,276
..and so is our conversation.

1399
01:58:30,378 --> 01:58:36,826
Let anything happen.

1400
01:58:43,972 --> 01:58:47,193
Raja sir, please to step aside.

1401
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:51,486
What is it?

1402
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,492
The night is alive and
so is the conversation.

1403
01:58:55,43 --> 01:58:58,654
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

1404
01:58:59,22 --> 01:59:03,43
Stay here. Let me find out more.

1405
01:59:03,443 --> 01:59:09,399
lf I don't come back alive,
don't tell grandpa I'm dead.

1406
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:40,927
Arjun Singh!

1407
01:59:41,825 --> 01:59:43,313
Arjun Singh!

1408
01:59:44,409 --> 01:59:47,83
Manager, what's going on?
Come with me!

1409
02:01:20,802 --> 02:01:22,143
Miss Nisha!

1410
02:01:23,90 --> 02:01:27,295
lf anything happens to Arjun Singh,
I'm going to kill you!

1411
02:01:27,511 --> 02:01:28,580
Boss!

1412
02:01:29,117 --> 02:01:31,859
Boss, nothing happened to me!

1413
02:01:32,135 --> 02:01:35,540
Something could've happened.
But I didn't let it happen!

1414
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,790
Here you are.
- Who is he?

1415
02:01:44,317 --> 02:01:47,922
A crocodile! Son of a crocodile!

1416
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:51,871
He was waiting for you.
With a knife.

1417
02:01:52,197 --> 02:01:55,997
And there I transpire.
And he takes me for you.

1418
02:01:56,964 --> 02:02:00,275
My leg was in his hand and
his neck was in my hand.

1419
02:02:01,31 --> 02:02:03,545
He grabs my foot! I grab his neck.

1420
02:02:03,997 --> 02:02:05,631
Sometimes I over him and..

1421
02:02:05,788 --> 02:02:06,990
..sometimes he's over me.

1422
02:02:07,512 --> 02:02:10,398
Sir, in this chaos..

1423
02:02:10,478 --> 02:02:11,730
..I ripped his mask off!

1424
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:13,991
And then I ask him, who are you?

1425
02:02:14,610 --> 02:02:17,485
Where have you come from? Are
you amphibious, or terrestrial?

1426
02:02:17,802 --> 02:02:19,925
But he's dumbstruck.

1427
02:02:21,297 --> 02:02:23,721
And when I was bringing him to you..

1428
02:02:25,264 --> 02:02:27,471
..he took out a pill from somewhere.

1429
02:02:29,264 --> 02:02:30,322
And this is the result!

1430
02:02:31,635 --> 02:02:34,290
Who might it be?

1431
02:02:34,776 --> 02:02:36,205
Sir, this..

1432
02:02:36,351 --> 02:02:41,526
No. How do I tell you? His
soul has already departed.

1433
02:02:41,976 --> 02:02:50,36
That leaves your friend. Your
well-wisher. The light of your eyes!

1434
02:02:50,117 --> 02:02:52,409
Miss Nisha! She is the
only one who can tell us.

1435
02:02:52,916 --> 02:02:58,984
It was her party after all.

1436
02:02:59,64 --> 02:03:00,191
And..

1437
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,992
So this is what you really are!

1438
02:03:04,917 --> 02:03:07,272
But you aren't going to kill me.

1439
02:03:08,272 --> 02:03:11,722
I fell in love with you. And
in you, I looked for life!

1440
02:03:12,417 --> 02:03:18,736
But you were for sale!
Going to the highest bidder!

1441
02:03:19,887 --> 02:03:23,490
And you're fascinated
with death, aren't you?

1442
02:03:24,134 --> 02:03:27,605
Take this and shoot yourself.

1443
02:03:28,989 --> 02:03:31,598
Set the good soul free
from these evil trappings.

1444
02:03:31,988 --> 02:03:37,898
lf you can't help yourself,
I will have to.

1445
02:03:39,68 --> 02:03:39,879
Mr. Raja.

1446
02:03:41,371 --> 02:03:44,452
All I want to hear from you is
the passing of your last breath.

1447
02:03:44,532 --> 02:03:51,702
I am not sorry to die. What makes
me sad is that I found the man..

1448
02:03:51,782 --> 02:03:58,615
..I looked for all my life. In you.
And all of a sudden, I lose you!

1449
02:04:00,226 --> 02:04:06,432
I know you don't believe me.
But this is for your sake.

1450
02:04:07,329 --> 02:04:10,442
Let me live a while longer.
I will protect you.

1451
02:04:10,523 --> 02:04:14,237
I guess I'm destined to kill you.

1452
02:04:15,80 --> 02:04:18,581
I will not let you commit the sin.

1453
02:04:29,849 --> 02:04:31,329
Arjun Singh! What is this?!

1454
02:04:31,739 --> 02:04:35,505
Bullets. I emptied her gun.

1455
02:04:36,1 --> 02:04:40,345
Otherwise, she wouldn't
have spilled the beans.

1456
02:04:41,47 --> 02:04:42,236
By now, she'd be gone.

1457
02:04:42,442 --> 02:04:45,555
And with her the names of
those who intend to kill you.

1458
02:04:47,223 --> 02:04:50,993
You know Miss Nisha, Grandpa says..

1459
02:04:52,103 --> 02:04:57,317
..don't kill a sinner.
Slay the Satan within.

1460
02:04:58,397 --> 02:05:02,434
And you know the
names of these Satans.

1461
02:05:02,753 --> 02:05:07,367
The ones who want to kill Raja.
Please give us the names.

1462
02:05:07,814 --> 02:05:10,334
Your demons will be exorcised.

1463
02:05:10,805 --> 02:05:15,333
Believe me! I know nothing!
I haven't met them.

1464
02:05:16,335 --> 02:05:20,21
All I've heard is a voice.
A woman's voice.

1465
02:05:21,634 --> 02:05:23,461
A woman's voice?

1466
02:05:23,772 --> 02:05:26,375
Yes. - Hear that?! A woman's voice!

1467
02:05:26,659 --> 02:05:28,594
It's Savitri mother!
Who else can it be?!

1468
02:05:28,674 --> 02:05:29,771
Boss!

1469
02:05:30,215 --> 02:05:32,576
Boss, I don't know why
this happens to me..

1470
02:05:32,656 --> 02:05:36,182
..every time you mention my mother!
The effect is electric!

1471
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:42,587
Do me a favor. Don't accuse
her until you have the evidence!

1472
02:05:43,114 --> 02:05:44,918
You want evidence?! Okay.

1473
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:50,584
Here's proof. I found it on a
man who was about to kill me.

1474
02:05:50,952 --> 02:05:54,108
It explains itself.

1475
02:05:54,433 --> 02:05:56,293
Read it! Have you
anything else to say?

1476
02:06:05,757 --> 02:06:06,821
Mother!

1477
02:06:29,354 --> 02:06:32,569
What? But how could it be?!

1478
02:06:32,924 --> 02:06:38,668
No, no Mr. Mehta! I
couldn't be! He's still alive!

1479
02:06:39,44 --> 02:06:41,259
Find out, why is he alive till now.

1480
02:06:41,339 --> 02:06:42,676
Okay.
- Yes.

1481
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:45,643
You?

1482
02:06:45,914 --> 02:06:51,514
I'm here at an inappropriate
moment? You thought I'm dead.

1483
02:06:51,594 --> 02:06:53,382
Mission accomplished, did you think?

1484
02:06:54,874 --> 02:06:58,41
But I'm alive. Sorry to
have ruined your plans.

1485
02:07:00,555 --> 02:07:06,714
Who were you shouting at?
Who is this assassin?

1486
02:07:07,323 --> 02:07:10,452
Every time you wag a finger,
he's after my life!

1487
02:07:11,237 --> 02:07:17,929
Tell him if he's man enough,
he will face me!

1488
02:07:18,664 --> 02:07:19,710
Call him!

1489
02:07:20,437 --> 02:07:27,151
What are you saying, Raja?
You expect me to kill you?

1490
02:07:28,632 --> 02:07:31,885
Can a mother kill her son?

1491
02:07:31,966 --> 02:07:33,708
Whose mother?

1492
02:07:34,784 --> 02:07:40,891
I know everything! Stop acting.

1493
02:07:41,308 --> 02:07:42,836
My mother is dead.

1494
02:07:43,74 --> 02:07:45,495
And you are the one
who killed my father!

1495
02:07:46,15 --> 02:07:48,988
You must've seduced him and..

1496
02:07:49,68 --> 02:07:51,972
Raja, what did you say today!

1497
02:07:53,59 --> 02:07:55,43
You've insulted me!

1498
02:07:56,686 --> 02:07:59,268
You insult my loyalty!

1499
02:08:00,58 --> 02:08:02,350
You've humiliated me today.

1500
02:08:03,86 --> 02:08:07,302
I sacrificed so much
to live to this day!

1501
02:08:07,897 --> 02:08:12,264
My husband gave his life!
My family was destroyed!

1502
02:08:12,815 --> 02:08:14,717
My son taken away from me!

1503
02:08:14,797 --> 02:08:16,165
For the money!

1504
02:08:16,977 --> 02:08:18,825
I know everything about you!

1505
02:08:19,426 --> 02:08:21,824
What did you and
your husband sacrificed?

1506
02:08:22,444 --> 02:08:24,187
Your husband, that Bhim
Singh deserted his father!

1507
02:08:24,416 --> 02:08:29,474
He left his home in Lakhanpur.
And why did he marry you?

1508
02:08:30,52 --> 02:08:33,867
Because you and your
husband wanted to loot my father!

1509
02:08:34,753 --> 02:08:38,587
My husband was loyal.
When he was dying..

1510
02:08:38,667 --> 02:08:42,306
..he extracted a promise from me.
That I must protect you..

1511
02:08:42,929 --> 02:08:45,408
..be it even at the
cost of my own son!

1512
02:08:46,133 --> 02:08:47,760
Give him his rights.

1513
02:08:49,55 --> 02:08:52,690
Because of you, my
father-in-law hates me.

1514
02:08:53,634 --> 02:08:55,587
He took my son away from me.

1515
02:08:55,667 --> 02:08:56,908
He threw me out!

1516
02:08:57,877 --> 02:09:02,521
And he made me promise
that I must never reveal..

1517
02:09:02,601 --> 02:09:09,356
..the secret to my son! I
cannot tell my son who he is!

1518
02:09:11,765 --> 02:09:16,987
And all my life, I
have lived for you!

1519
02:09:17,650 --> 02:09:25,289
And today, you call me greedy!

1520
02:09:26,90 --> 02:09:27,520
Go, my son.

1521
02:09:28,122 --> 02:09:29,909
Lord, preserve you!

1522
02:09:31,40 --> 02:09:33,46
I was born poor.

1523
02:09:33,937 --> 02:09:35,925
I've worked for a living.

1524
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:38,271
Wealth means little to me.

1525
02:09:38,855 --> 02:09:44,705
Everything here, all
this wealth belongs to you!

1526
02:09:44,785 --> 02:09:46,282
May the fires of Hell
consume the wealth..

1527
02:09:46,363 --> 02:09:49,180
..that threatens my own life!
I don't want anything!

1528
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:51,245
I'll sell everything!

1529
02:09:51,429 --> 02:09:55,299
Each and every thing!
I'll sell it all!

1530
02:10:04,693 --> 02:10:06,164
Madam..

1531
02:10:07,677 --> 02:10:12,66
Arjun! Raja wants to
sell everything off!

1532
02:10:12,456 --> 02:10:14,348
He has a death wish!

1533
02:10:14,834 --> 02:10:16,240
Stop him, Arjun!

1534
02:10:16,588 --> 02:10:20,166
He won't listen to me! He hates me!

1535
02:10:20,679 --> 02:10:23,377
Don't let him sell anything!
It'll be the end of everything!

1536
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:26,512
I won't be able to keep my promise!

1537
02:10:27,45 --> 02:10:29,450
I beg of you!
- Hey Mother..

1538
02:10:30,37 --> 02:10:31,218
What are you doing?

1539
02:10:31,608 --> 02:10:34,566
No mother, these
hands are not to beg.

1540
02:10:34,847 --> 02:10:36,795
Your hands are to be
raised in blessing!

1541
02:10:38,136 --> 02:10:43,593
Mother. I remember telling
you that my mother is no more.

1542
02:10:44,374 --> 02:10:46,101
I was mistaken mother!

1543
02:10:46,697 --> 02:10:49,746
My mother is standing
right in front of me!

1544
02:10:50,397 --> 02:10:52,570
You had promised your husband.

1545
02:10:52,907 --> 02:10:55,3
Today, your son is promising you.

1546
02:10:55,930 --> 02:10:57,603
I will not let him
sell anything, mother.

1547
02:10:58,674 --> 02:11:00,536
I won't let him
sell anything, mother.

1548
02:11:01,244 --> 02:11:03,106
I won't let the boss sell anything!

1549
02:11:03,964 --> 02:11:07,225
I swear it by my father! I
won't let him sell anything!

1550
02:11:07,537 --> 02:11:08,903
I will not let him sell anything!

1551
02:11:08,983 --> 02:11:10,511
I won't let him
sell anything, mother.

1552
02:11:10,591 --> 02:11:15,114
Yes, I lied to you till
now that your mother is dead.

1553
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,240
You want to know the truth?
- Then listen.

1554
02:11:19,274 --> 02:11:23,575
She took my son away
from me! Your father.

1555
02:11:25,376 --> 02:11:28,996
No, Grandpa. My mother
could never do that.

1556
02:11:31,60 --> 02:11:33,578
The woman who has sacrificed
everything for the sake of others..

1557
02:11:34,735 --> 02:11:35,848
..could never have done this.

1558
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:39,394
It's nothing more than hearsay.

1559
02:11:41,264 --> 02:11:45,440
Why, Grandpa? Why did you
take me away from my mother?

1560
02:11:46,264 --> 02:11:49,336
You have denied me my
mother's love! Tell me.

1561
02:11:50,161 --> 02:11:56,695
Have I not given you love?
- Yes. You gave me all your love.

1562
02:11:58,212 --> 02:12:06,454
But today.. I heard
someone speak ill of my mother.

1563
02:12:07,336 --> 02:12:12,40
And she wept! And I
couldn't even console my mother!

1564
02:12:12,615 --> 02:12:18,36
And all this because of what
you taught me. About loyalty.

1565
02:12:19,330 --> 02:12:22,540
All I could do was watch silently.

1566
02:12:23,261 --> 02:12:26,454
But let me tell you something.
After what I've seen and heard..

1567
02:12:27,216 --> 02:12:31,992
..in my place you would
begin to respect her too.

1568
02:12:38,725 --> 02:12:40,439
Let Rajkumar sell his hotels..

1569
02:12:40,519 --> 02:12:45,861
..why are you so worried?
- We might lose the hotels.

1570
02:12:45,941 --> 02:12:50,81
And who do you think is
going to buy the hotels? Our men.

1571
02:12:51,16 --> 02:12:53,540
Nice to know you gentlemen.

1572
02:12:54,248 --> 02:12:57,607
You are here to bid
for this hotel? - Yes.

1573
02:12:58,524 --> 02:13:03,446
You see, my boss is a bit eccentric.

1574
02:13:03,739 --> 02:13:09,246
Before you, there have
been men of wealth and worth..

1575
02:13:09,327 --> 02:13:15,432
..who wanted to buy this hotel.
But the boss shooed them out.

1576
02:13:16,348 --> 02:13:20,859
But this hotel is unique, for sure.

1577
02:13:21,473 --> 02:13:25,182
So I guess you will have to put
up with Mr. Rajkumar's tantrums.

1578
02:13:25,262 --> 02:13:26,982
And what are we expected to do?

1579
02:13:27,595 --> 02:13:29,714
Just do as he does.

1580
02:13:30,415 --> 02:13:32,314
Stand up if he stands up.

1581
02:13:32,902 --> 02:13:34,881
When he pulls this chair back,
you pull your chairs back too.

1582
02:13:35,849 --> 02:13:37,835
When he sits down, you sit down too.

1583
02:13:38,278 --> 02:13:39,634
lf he sneezes, you sneeze too.

1584
02:13:39,870 --> 02:13:41,461
When he scratches his nose, be
sure to scratch your nose too!

1585
02:13:41,541 --> 02:13:44,55
And when he clears his throat..
- We do too!

1586
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:45,764
Mr. Arjun, sir is here.

1587
02:13:45,844 --> 02:13:48,179
Sir is here, so
everyone be ready now.

1588
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:57,938
Hello!
- Hello!

1589
02:13:58,508 --> 02:14:00,245
How are you?
- How are you?

1590
02:14:00,638 --> 02:14:02,776
Fine, thank you.
- Fine, thank you.

1591
02:14:28,158 --> 02:14:30,5
Strange!
- Strange!

1592
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:32,426
Arjun Singh! What's going on?

1593
02:14:32,506 --> 02:14:33,845
Arjun Singh! What's going on?

1594
02:14:33,925 --> 02:14:35,118
Please go ahead, sir.

1595
02:14:35,539 --> 02:14:36,646
Yes.
- Yes.

1596
02:14:37,441 --> 02:14:40,383
Let's cut the
drama and start eating.

1597
02:14:40,576 --> 02:14:43,497
Let's cut the
drama and start eating.

1598
02:14:45,268 --> 02:14:47,903
Please go ahead.
I'll take care of them.

1599
02:14:56,475 --> 02:14:57,908
A fly?
- A fly!

1600
02:14:58,558 --> 02:15:01,271
Arjun Singh! You know I hate flies!

1601
02:15:01,351 --> 02:15:03,885
Arjun Singh! You know I hate flies!

1602
02:15:03,966 --> 02:15:06,702
Not to worry, sir.
I'll take care of the fly.

1603
02:15:11,60 --> 02:15:12,167
Got her, Boss!

1604
02:15:12,666 --> 02:15:16,322
I caught it. Where is it?

1605
02:15:20,47 --> 02:15:22,68
Shameless, idiot.
- What nonsense!

1606
02:15:22,149 --> 02:15:24,989
Sir, not you, but was
telling it to that fly.

1607
02:15:25,364 --> 02:15:27,714
This man doesn't tolerate
the hair on his own head!

1608
02:15:27,795 --> 02:15:29,798
And you dare sit
right on top of his head!

1609
02:15:30,39 --> 02:15:32,303
Don't you move, sir! Don't move.

1610
02:15:32,632 --> 02:15:37,384
This fly is an insult!
I'll break her head!

1611
02:15:40,179 --> 02:15:48,518
Oh no! There she is! The bitch!
You know what you're sitting on?

1612
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:51,578
That's Mr. Talwar's nose!

1613
02:15:51,899 --> 02:15:53,689
Mr. Talwar!

1614
02:15:54,46 --> 02:15:59,893
You know what will happen
to you if you annoy him?

1615
02:16:00,132 --> 02:16:02,499
Sir, don't move. Not even a bit.

1616
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:04,12
I'll take her!

1617
02:16:10,266 --> 02:16:11,764
Now where is she?

1618
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:17,242
You're going to find
me wherever you go!

1619
02:16:21,512 --> 02:16:23,571
Look at her now!

1620
02:16:25,905 --> 02:16:33,784
Mr. Kirorimal's whiskers
are worth a million each!

1621
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:43,210
Does she think it's a
place to go picnicking?

1622
02:16:43,409 --> 02:16:44,938
Don't you move, sir!

1623
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:46,478
Don't move.

1624
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:51,618
I caught it.

1625
02:16:51,713 --> 02:16:54,347
I caught it.

1626
02:16:56,494 --> 02:16:57,609
I caught it.

1627
02:17:08,250 --> 02:17:09,573
A tooth!

1628
02:17:11,630 --> 02:17:16,309
Sir.. take it, your property..

1629
02:17:18,714 --> 02:17:20,38
But where's the fly?

1630
02:17:25,858 --> 02:17:27,362
There you are!

1631
02:17:29,855 --> 02:17:32,118
Beware! Don't you move, sir!

1632
02:17:32,335 --> 02:17:36,832
No matter what, but today
I'll surely kill that fly.

1633
02:17:53,545 --> 02:17:55,360
That's how they run scoundrel!

1634
02:17:55,440 --> 02:17:57,324
They want your hotel, do they?

1635
02:17:57,496 --> 02:18:03,153
Sir. If this hotel goes on the
block, I'll be ashamed of myself!

1636
02:18:03,233 --> 02:18:05,462
Arjun singh!
- Sir! Don't you move!

1637
02:18:05,635 --> 02:18:06,846
I won't move, sir.

1638
02:18:08,558 --> 02:18:11,524
Sir, don't sell the hotel!

1639
02:18:13,12 --> 02:18:15,113
Poonam, tell me fast! Do you
recognize the handwriting?

1640
02:18:15,857 --> 02:18:17,224
I think I know.

1641
02:18:18,62 --> 02:18:23,355
It looks just like the manager's.
It's Mr. Ranjit's handwriting.

1642
02:18:23,528 --> 02:18:27,665
Give it to me.
That's half the job done!

1643
02:18:34,234 --> 02:18:35,549
Arjun Singh!

1644
02:18:40,28 --> 02:18:41,906
Tell me, Mr. Zalim(cruel) Singh.
- Zalim Singh?

1645
02:18:42,546 --> 02:18:43,748
Are you out of your mind?

1646
02:18:44,34 --> 02:18:47,475
I'm Ranjit Singh!
- Never mind your name.

1647
02:18:47,556 --> 02:18:50,865
I'd rather call you Mr. Villain.
- Just a little thing.

1648
02:18:50,945 --> 02:18:52,180
What nonsense!

1649
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:58,157
No nonsense, Mr. Villain. I
appreciate your handwriting.

1650
02:19:00,509 --> 02:19:03,9
It's beautiful! Excellent!

1651
02:19:04,489 --> 02:19:08,321
Whether it's a note in
a file, or a letter..

1652
02:19:09,193 --> 02:19:10,682
..the handwriting remains the same!

1653
02:19:11,651 --> 02:19:13,951
But.. wonderful!

1654
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:21,26
The letter is signed by the lady.
But it's the villain's handiwork!

1655
02:19:28,357 --> 02:19:31,338
Now what, Arjun Singh?
- Here..

1656
02:19:32,467 --> 02:19:33,629
You can have another.

1657
02:19:35,11 --> 02:19:38,452
Burn as many as you want.
And I'll produce more.

1658
02:19:39,49 --> 02:19:43,408
But take care, you
might burn your fingers..

1659
02:19:43,901 --> 02:19:50,726
..your hopes of making it rich
quick might be dashed! - Yes.

1660
02:19:51,833 --> 02:19:53,478
What do you want?

1661
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:58,850
All I want you to understand is..

1662
02:19:59,919 --> 02:20:05,505
..I want to become
rich too. Just like you.

1663
02:20:06,59 --> 02:20:08,464
So I came here looking for a deal.

1664
02:20:10,107 --> 02:20:10,963
What deal?

1665
02:20:11,128 --> 02:20:14,622
Rajkumar's death.

1666
02:20:16,205 --> 02:20:19,959
You have been trying to kill him.
And I have always saved him.

1667
02:20:20,918 --> 02:20:26,297
Pardon me for saying this,
you couldn't even touch him.

1668
02:20:26,653 --> 02:20:30,626
lf I was in your shoes, I would
see that even you would be benefited.

1669
02:20:30,942 --> 02:20:35,648
Yes. So it's best
for us to join hands.

1670
02:20:36,876 --> 02:20:40,24
Partnership. Fifty-fifty.

1671
02:20:41,962 --> 02:20:46,268
Arjun Singh, if I accept
your proposal, what do I gain?

1672
02:20:46,709 --> 02:20:48,897
At last you speak your mind!

1673
02:20:48,977 --> 02:20:51,457
Yes.. right said.

1674
02:20:51,537 --> 02:20:53,405
The thing is.. excuse me.

1675
02:20:56,101 --> 02:20:58,172
Sir, listen to my plan too.

1676
02:21:02,614 --> 02:21:07,189
I started planning the very
day I set my foot in here!

1677
02:21:08,495 --> 02:21:12,345
Why do you think I risked
my life to save Mr. Raja?

1678
02:21:13,97 --> 02:21:19,939
So that when I kill him,
no one would suspect me.

1679
02:21:21,435 --> 02:21:30,750
And after he is dead, we
divide his millions. Fifty-fifty.

1680
02:21:30,941 --> 02:21:35,420
I started planning the very day,
I set my foot in here!

1681
02:21:35,835 --> 02:21:39,969
Why do you think I risked
my life to save Mr. Raja?

1682
02:21:41,84 --> 02:21:46,386
So that when I killed him,
no one would suspect me.

1683
02:21:46,948 --> 02:21:52,120
And after he is dead,
we divide his millions.

1684
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,539
Fifty-fifty.

1685
02:21:54,619 --> 02:22:00,8
You are a different kind of man.
Like a mug without the bottom.

1686
02:22:01,54 --> 02:22:03,856
You make a deal with me.
And then you sell me out!

1687
02:22:03,936 --> 02:22:05,145
Then this is true!

1688
02:22:05,225 --> 02:22:10,584
Sir. The evidence is here.
How can I lie?

1689
02:22:10,664 --> 02:22:12,894
Scoundrel! Traitor!

1690
02:22:13,924 --> 02:22:17,150
Listen, sir. Use your mouth.
Not your hands.

1691
02:22:18,196 --> 02:22:20,350
Sir.. I am warning you.

1692
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:23,91
Enough of bossing over me!

1693
02:22:24,329 --> 02:22:28,318
You have raised your hand. This
is the end of the relationship.

1694
02:22:29,155 --> 02:22:32,995
lf you raise your hand,
I'll send you to heaven.

1695
02:22:33,167 --> 02:22:36,402
You think you can kill me?
What are you doing, sir?!

1696
02:22:36,938 --> 02:22:40,286
You want to kill a mere
servant and go to jail.

1697
02:22:40,366 --> 02:22:48,337
He can't take any risks.
To do that, you need guts.

1698
02:22:48,417 --> 02:22:50,585
Arjun Singh! Go away! Or else..
- What can you do?

1699
02:22:51,355 --> 02:22:57,608
lf you are born out of wedlock
you'll see me outside the hotel!

1700
02:22:57,688 --> 02:23:00,308
Arjun Singh!
- Sir, what are you doing?

1701
02:23:00,388 --> 02:23:03,149
Hey you! Let go of me!
- Sir, calm down!

1702
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:05,90
Let go of me!
- No, sir.

1703
02:23:05,170 --> 02:23:08,680
Mr. Raja, what you saw was loyalty.

1704
02:23:09,459 --> 02:23:10,928
Now wait till you
see what treachery is!

1705
02:23:11,702 --> 02:23:15,400
lf I don't ruin you,
I'm not Arjun Singh!

1706
02:23:15,884 --> 02:23:17,761
Whom do you want to ruin?

1707
02:23:18,219 --> 02:23:21,552
My son? My Raja?

1708
02:23:21,722 --> 02:23:23,217
How dare you?!

1709
02:23:23,382 --> 02:23:24,583
You scoundrel!

1710
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:36,726
Father! You!

1711
02:23:55,474 --> 02:24:00,164
All my life, you have
put me to test, Lord!

1712
02:24:01,133 --> 02:24:04,609
I have gone beyond the call of duty!

1713
02:24:05,414 --> 02:24:09,310
And You have a duty too.
Your duty towards me!

1714
02:24:14,372 --> 02:24:16,769
What more do you
want to extract from me?

1715
02:24:17,129 --> 02:24:19,41
Dear, I didn't come to
extract anything from you.

1716
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:22,244
I am here to apologize.

1717
02:24:23,247 --> 02:24:28,247
I have erred. I cannot
give those years back to you.

1718
02:24:28,809 --> 02:24:32,422
But by apologizing,
I can lessen my sins.

1719
02:24:33,525 --> 02:24:40,238
What can I give you? A human
does what is written in his destiny.

1720
02:24:40,873 --> 02:24:44,609
Were it not destined,
I'd never have promised.

1721
02:24:45,99 --> 02:24:51,89
And I'd never have kept my promise.
I wouldn't have abandoned my son.

1722
02:24:51,487 --> 02:24:56,710
Then put an end to this.
Embrace your son.

1723
02:25:16,61 --> 02:25:17,101
Arjun!

1724
02:25:18,629 --> 02:25:19,540
My son!

1725
02:25:21,140 --> 02:25:22,144
My son.

1726
02:25:27,858 --> 02:25:28,657
Mother!

1727
02:25:29,746 --> 02:25:32,532
Son! - Mother!
- My son..

1728
02:25:39,614 --> 02:25:43,174
My son! I slapped you!

1729
02:25:43,455 --> 02:25:44,432
No!

1730
02:25:45,332 --> 02:25:46,576
Enough, mother.

1731
02:25:47,87 --> 02:25:50,572
That is all I ever wished!
How I wished for a mother..

1732
02:25:50,652 --> 02:25:53,789
..who would scold me,
who would slap me!

1733
02:25:54,525 --> 02:25:56,234
A mother who would embrace me!

1734
02:25:57,404 --> 02:25:59,955
Don't say that, my son!
Don't say that.

1735
02:26:00,206 --> 02:26:02,161
Let me say it, mummy! Let me!

1736
02:26:02,853 --> 02:26:06,536
I have never spoken to my mother!

1737
02:26:08,327 --> 02:26:12,385
How unfortunate are these people
who are denied a mother's love!

1738
02:26:13,664 --> 02:26:17,79
How lucky I am! I
have found my mother!

1739
02:26:17,890 --> 02:26:21,333
She hit me. I got her love.

1740
02:26:21,957 --> 02:26:25,511
No son, I slapped you!

1741
02:26:26,558 --> 02:26:32,706
For your sake, I would even die!

1742
02:26:43,99 --> 02:26:44,370
What? What are you saying?

1743
02:26:45,71 --> 02:26:47,657
Yes. Savitri is
Arjun Singh's mother.

1744
02:26:48,90 --> 02:26:48,816
Mother?

1745
02:26:48,896 --> 02:26:49,586
Yes.

1746
02:26:49,923 --> 02:26:52,113
But she admonished him in public.

1747
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:55,650
Yes, this all was a melodrama.

1748
02:26:55,794 --> 02:26:57,534
She played it front of everyone.

1749
02:26:57,719 --> 02:27:00,10
People will do anything for money.

1750
02:27:00,91 --> 02:27:01,538
All she did was to slap him.

1751
02:27:01,923 --> 02:27:03,597
She has her eyes on your money.

1752
02:27:04,294 --> 02:27:10,905
So! - I bet I know who is
behind these attempts on your life.

1753
02:27:11,63 --> 02:27:13,855
It's Savitri. But everyone
seems to think so highly of her.

1754
02:27:14,773 --> 02:27:17,46
You don't believe me,
do you? Then ok.

1755
02:27:17,685 --> 02:27:18,479
Bhairon!

1756
02:27:20,991 --> 02:27:23,50
This is Bhairon.

1757
02:27:23,294 --> 02:27:26,951
He's from Arjun's village.
He's Arjun's childhood friend.

1758
02:27:27,405 --> 02:27:32,495
Bhairon, tell him how Ms.
Savitri and Arjun are related.

1759
02:27:33,11 --> 02:27:34,502
They..
- Tell it!

1760
02:27:34,936 --> 02:27:36,333
They are mother and son.

1761
02:27:36,639 --> 02:27:38,821
Did you hear that? You may leave.

1762
02:27:41,98 --> 02:27:43,64
Where is Arjun Singh?

1763
02:27:43,869 --> 02:27:47,352
Not to worry, sir.
Wherever he is, I will find him.

1764
02:27:47,932 --> 02:27:49,419
Sir, let go of him.

1765
02:27:50,23 --> 02:27:51,116
Brother.

1766
02:27:51,197 --> 02:27:54,27
For the last time,
where is Arjun Singh?

1767
02:27:55,13 --> 02:28:01,204
For the first time, here I am.

1768
02:28:02,361 --> 02:28:03,550
Leave it!

1769
02:28:05,315 --> 02:28:06,517
Arjun!

1770
02:28:10,461 --> 02:28:10,954
Thank you!

1771
02:28:11,34 --> 02:28:13,521
Yes. Mr. Zalim Singh..

1772
02:28:14,283 --> 02:28:17,561
..you always miss your target.

1773
02:28:18,54 --> 02:28:21,62
Missed your aim on the
owner as well as his servant.

1774
02:28:21,305 --> 02:28:23,744
And that's because you're
basically a rotten fellow.

1775
02:28:24,289 --> 02:28:32,886
Look here. See? The ace villain that
you are, I took a few tips from you.

1776
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:41,413
So first you pay up for my dress.

1777
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:43,411
And then you take a lashing.

1778
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:47,000
Because, the bullets that
you shot here and there..

1779
02:28:47,458 --> 02:28:50,321
..if by mistake you
would've hit here.

1780
02:28:50,401 --> 02:28:52,24
Like the one that I
am going to shoot now.

1781
02:28:52,266 --> 02:28:53,252
Then you would stand to gain.

1782
02:28:53,468 --> 02:28:56,858
You understand at last, don't you?

1783
02:28:57,135 --> 02:29:05,551
Yes. Now tell me, who
is pulling the strings?

1784
02:29:06,735 --> 02:29:10,801
A moron like you can never
hatch such a sinister plot.

1785
02:29:11,311 --> 02:29:19,130
This must be the handiwork
of some big-time villain!

1786
02:29:20,20 --> 02:29:23,4
Speak up, my boy. Who is it?

1787
02:29:23,687 --> 02:29:24,938
Who?

1788
02:29:25,492 --> 02:29:26,671
My dad?

1789
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:31,375
Yes. Ultimately, the
cat's out of the bag!

1790
02:29:31,977 --> 02:29:35,329
So, you even have a father.

1791
02:29:35,868 --> 02:29:36,876
How many fathers do you have?

1792
02:29:37,30 --> 02:29:38,761
I mean.. where is your father?

1793
02:29:40,526 --> 02:29:42,514
Come with me, I'll show it to you.
- Let's go.

1794
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,426
Come, son.

1795
02:30:03,28 --> 02:30:04,32
Where's your daddy?

1796
02:30:06,713 --> 02:30:07,587
Where is he?

1797
02:30:14,333 --> 02:30:17,707
You have a lot of daddies!
- Not at all. Not at all.

1798
02:30:18,632 --> 02:30:22,15
Dear, everyone has only one father.

1799
02:30:22,337 --> 02:30:25,422
Not only his, but
even you have a father.

1800
02:30:25,869 --> 02:30:27,522
But I must give you credit.

1801
02:30:27,859 --> 02:30:33,495
To reach me, you've
used my son as a pretext.

1802
02:30:34,456 --> 02:30:39,311
When your father couldn't do
anything to me, who are you?

1803
02:30:41,136 --> 02:30:42,252
Look. Over there.

1804
02:30:46,766 --> 02:30:48,556
Don't be surprised, dear.

1805
02:30:48,636 --> 02:30:51,272
Let me introduce you, son.

1806
02:30:58,537 --> 02:31:06,35
Dear, this is your mother
and this is your grandpa.

1807
02:31:08,812 --> 02:31:11,268
This is your childhood friend.

1808
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:13,596
Nisha's mother.

1809
02:31:17,971 --> 02:31:21,578
She is your master's.. Ms. Nisha.

1810
02:31:23,723 --> 02:31:25,625
So you've seen it all.

1811
02:31:26,871 --> 02:31:29,188
Now you decide.

1812
02:31:30,521 --> 02:31:33,184
Give the revolver to my son.
And let's strike a deal.

1813
02:31:34,24 --> 02:31:37,440
Else, your family is dead.

1814
02:31:39,331 --> 02:31:45,881
Arjun Singh, I'm running out of time!
Give the revolver back or.. - Wait!

1815
02:31:48,908 --> 02:31:53,975
Here.
- Smart kid. Give me.

1816
02:31:54,572 --> 02:31:57,270
Good. Smart kid.

1817
02:31:57,742 --> 02:32:00,480
Not stubborn like daddy.
Your daddy was a fool.

1818
02:32:01,147 --> 02:32:04,743
You can have the
deal your daddy missed.

1819
02:32:06,507 --> 02:32:11,582
I want Rajkumar to
sign these papers.

1820
02:32:13,165 --> 02:32:15,225
And then, I'd like to see him dead.

1821
02:32:17,861 --> 02:32:19,599
You can take your family home
as soon as you've done the job.

1822
02:32:19,807 --> 02:32:22,593
No.. I can't do this.

1823
02:32:22,673 --> 02:32:25,343
I can't kill Mr. Raja!

1824
02:32:25,423 --> 02:32:28,862
At least you can get him to sign.

1825
02:32:29,338 --> 02:32:31,380
My son will do the rest of it.

1826
02:32:33,308 --> 02:32:34,899
You will hang for it.

1827
02:32:36,6 --> 02:32:37,286
Tell me. Do you agree?

1828
02:32:38,713 --> 02:32:39,803
Think it over.

1829
02:32:42,909 --> 02:32:44,283
Raja sir. Yes.

1830
02:32:45,19 --> 02:32:46,783
Mr. Raja, it's been two days,
and there's no news of your mother.

1831
02:32:47,129 --> 02:32:49,890
I think.. - What can I do?
Why have you come here?

1832
02:32:50,915 --> 02:32:53,104
Call the police if
you want to find her.

1833
02:32:53,779 --> 02:32:57,542
Fine. If I don't find them,
I'll go to the police station.

1834
02:32:59,99 --> 02:33:00,527
As of now, take this testament.

1835
02:33:01,115 --> 02:33:02,610
And please relieve me
of this responsibility.

1836
02:33:03,337 --> 02:33:05,517
Testament? Whose?

1837
02:33:06,832 --> 02:33:10,248
Your mother wrote
this will 15 years ago.

1838
02:33:10,775 --> 02:33:14,615
She told me that in the
eventuality of her death..

1839
02:33:15,13 --> 02:33:18,949
..I am to hand it
over to her son.. Raja.

1840
02:33:23,197 --> 02:33:28,23
Mother has willed me everything!

1841
02:33:28,887 --> 02:33:30,582
And I have been cursing her!

1842
02:33:31,369 --> 02:33:33,108
Mother..
- Sir..

1843
02:33:33,642 --> 02:33:36,732
Please step outside, sir! I want
to talk to you! It's urgent! Ok.

1844
02:33:43,919 --> 02:33:45,277
So what have you decided?

1845
02:33:45,744 --> 02:33:50,408
For the last time, will you do it?

1846
02:33:50,977 --> 02:33:51,980
Or should I?

1847
02:33:52,60 --> 02:33:54,3
No. I'll do it.

1848
02:33:55,111 --> 02:33:57,49
I'll do whatever you say!
- No, dear.

1849
02:33:57,542 --> 02:33:58,657
You must never do it!

1850
02:33:58,737 --> 02:34:02,867
lf you do it, the sacrifices
your father and I have made..

1851
02:34:02,948 --> 02:34:07,452
..will have been for nothing!
Don't do it, son! Don't do it!

1852
02:34:07,781 --> 02:34:09,787
And what have you gained?

1853
02:34:10,332 --> 02:34:12,857
You left your family!
You abandoned your son!

1854
02:34:13,56 --> 02:34:15,141
And what has Raja given
you for what you did for him?

1855
02:34:15,296 --> 02:34:16,714
He insulted you!

1856
02:34:17,71 --> 02:34:20,995
There's no question of being
loyal to a man who is selfish.

1857
02:34:21,75 --> 02:34:25,224
I say, you should always
cheat people like these.

1858
02:34:25,725 --> 02:34:26,985
Don't talk like that!

1859
02:34:27,65 --> 02:34:30,172
We are indebted to them!
You mustn't betray him.

1860
02:34:30,845 --> 02:34:36,69
Keep your lessons to yourself. See
what your principles have led to?

1861
02:34:36,312 --> 02:34:39,859
And this is what happens
to you and to my mother.

1862
02:34:40,124 --> 02:34:41,48
Stop, son!

1863
02:34:41,128 --> 02:34:42,415
I bind you with my oath.

1864
02:34:42,799 --> 02:34:47,113
You owe your life to the
father of the man you want to kill!

1865
02:34:47,487 --> 02:34:49,804
No! Don't stop me!

1866
02:34:50,30 --> 02:34:51,915
After so many years, I
have found my mother.

1867
02:34:52,365 --> 02:34:54,312
I don't want to lose my mother.

1868
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:59,378
I'll sacrifice Mr. Raja
for your love and affection.

1869
02:34:59,725 --> 02:35:01,552
Don't stop me.
- Stop!

1870
02:35:02,389 --> 02:35:05,353
My son goes with you. Go on, son.

1871
02:35:06,375 --> 02:35:09,272
And listen! If you
try to get smart..

1872
02:35:09,352 --> 02:35:13,951
..there will be no one
left to give them a funeral.

1873
02:35:14,572 --> 02:35:15,849
Yes sir, Raja speaking.

1874
02:35:16,709 --> 02:35:17,409
Yes.

1875
02:35:17,660 --> 02:35:18,939
My mother has been
missing for two days!

1876
02:35:19,19 --> 02:35:22,804
Please, do something and
find her out. Thank you.

1877
02:35:24,267 --> 02:35:26,83
The mother whom you were
cursing till yesterday..

1878
02:35:26,163 --> 02:35:27,857
..today you are very
concerned about her.

1879
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,451
Her life is in danger!
- I know.

1880
02:35:31,22 --> 02:35:33,727
And until you have
signed these papers..

1881
02:35:33,807 --> 02:35:35,694
..she continues to be in danger.

1882
02:35:36,237 --> 02:35:37,279
Arjun, what..

1883
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:40,302
Don't waste time. Just
do as I say. Come on.

1884
02:35:41,98 --> 02:35:41,975
Use the pen.

1885
02:35:43,149 --> 02:35:43,832
Go on.

1886
02:35:43,912 --> 02:35:45,17
Wait.

1887
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:47,18
Don't shoot him before
he signs the papers.

1888
02:35:47,98 --> 02:35:48,146
Come on.

1889
02:35:48,492 --> 02:35:49,167
Yes.

1890
02:35:49,964 --> 02:35:50,663
Here.

1891
02:36:07,139 --> 02:36:09,586
Give me..
- No..

1892
02:36:10,62 --> 02:36:13,269
Mr. Raja, we don't need you anymore.

1893
02:36:14,687 --> 02:36:16,201
Don't shoot him!

1894
02:36:18,233 --> 02:36:19,816
No!

1895
02:36:47,717 --> 02:36:50,251
Now you are left out..

1896
02:36:51,193 --> 02:36:54,194
Thanks. Mister.. give it to me.

1897
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:56,289
Give it to me.

1898
02:36:57,85 --> 02:36:58,545
What is the meaning of this?

1899
02:36:59,117 --> 02:37:00,596
Mr. Giridhar.

1900
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:08,405
You wanted to kill my family.
I wanted to kill yours.

1901
02:37:08,977 --> 02:37:11,295
This son of yours is a two-timer.

1902
02:37:12,748 --> 02:37:14,305
He killed Raja.

1903
02:37:14,385 --> 02:37:15,637
No!

1904
02:37:15,717 --> 02:37:16,917
And after that, he tried to kill me.

1905
02:37:17,228 --> 02:37:19,303
That means, my son..
- Yes.

1906
02:37:19,383 --> 02:37:23,791
Your son shot Mr. Raja.

1907
02:37:24,665 --> 02:37:27,190
He killed my Raja.
- Yes, mother.

1908
02:37:39,456 --> 02:37:41,392
The condition was Mr. Raja's death..

1909
02:37:41,472 --> 02:37:43,408
..will be the cause
for their release.

1910
02:37:44,523 --> 02:37:45,863
I'm holding the price.

1911
02:37:46,209 --> 02:37:47,230
You must let them go.

1912
02:37:47,310 --> 02:37:50,438
Yes, but the papers.
- You'll get it.

1913
02:37:51,165 --> 02:37:53,379
Give and take.

1914
02:37:54,409 --> 02:37:55,672
Untie them.

1915
02:37:55,931 --> 02:37:57,82
Fine.

1916
02:37:57,782 --> 02:37:58,829
Untie them.

1917
02:38:15,324 --> 02:38:15,737
Mother.

1918
02:38:15,817 --> 02:38:17,358
Don't you call me mother!

1919
02:38:17,633 --> 02:38:18,565
I'll explain later.

1920
02:38:18,922 --> 02:38:21,276
Bhairon, you take all of
them and leave. - Wait!

1921
02:38:21,548 --> 02:38:23,384
What is it now?

1922
02:38:23,464 --> 02:38:25,704
The signatures have disappeared.

1923
02:38:25,784 --> 02:38:27,539
This is too much.

1924
02:38:27,714 --> 02:38:30,438
God must have decided
not to answer your prayers!

1925
02:38:30,518 --> 02:38:32,738
I went through all this!
And to no avail!

1926
02:38:32,928 --> 02:38:35,237
You must be a sinner!
- Shut up!

1927
02:38:35,317 --> 02:38:36,758
Son! Look. What do we do now?

1928
02:38:36,839 --> 02:38:38,955
But he signed it.
Right in front of me!

1929
02:38:40,434 --> 02:38:47,188
Now which one of you goes to
heaven to get Raja's signature?

1930
02:38:47,570 --> 02:38:52,101
You're the one who goes, son!
- No!

1931
02:38:54,316 --> 02:38:56,573
Who shot the bullet?

1932
02:38:56,653 --> 02:38:58,60
We didn't.

1933
02:38:59,63 --> 02:39:00,26
It was me.

1934
02:39:04,97 --> 02:39:05,178
Rajkumar?

1935
02:39:10,450 --> 02:39:14,338
About turn! Hands up.

1936
02:39:16,814 --> 02:39:22,199
So you are the evil uncle!

1937
02:39:22,444 --> 02:39:26,756
Son! He's alive! But
you said you killed him!

1938
02:39:26,836 --> 02:39:31,26
When you are alive even
after you are dead for all..

1939
02:39:31,311 --> 02:39:33,333
..I never died.

1940
02:39:34,615 --> 02:39:35,878
You don't get it?

1941
02:39:36,81 --> 02:39:37,619
Arjun Singh!
- Yes boss?

1942
02:39:37,850 --> 02:39:39,638
Please explain.
- Yes boss!

1943
02:39:40,660 --> 02:39:43,964
So, Mr. Giridhar. The thing is..

1944
02:39:44,309 --> 02:39:47,250
..your son shot him..

1945
02:39:47,528 --> 02:39:49,136
The pistol was real, but..

1946
02:39:49,517 --> 02:39:54,126
..the bullets inside the pistol..

1947
02:39:54,206 --> 02:39:56,711
..Were.. Were..

1948
02:39:57,850 --> 02:39:59,118
You get it?

1949
02:39:59,489 --> 02:40:00,319
Or don't you?

1950
02:40:00,630 --> 02:40:06,822
Look! Now how about me
shooting your son? No!

1951
02:40:09,841 --> 02:40:13,560
See? The scoundrel that
he is, he's still alive.

1952
02:40:13,742 --> 02:40:15,757
And you think Raja could die?

1953
02:40:17,201 --> 02:40:22,753
And because, this was the same
revolver used by Mr. Vijay Merchant..

1954
02:40:22,834 --> 02:40:24,302
..and Mr. Vijay Hazare.

1955
02:40:24,960 --> 02:40:27,396
Didn't get it.
Hey!

1956
02:40:28,862 --> 02:40:31,7
Yes, Mr. Rajkumar.

1957
02:40:31,807 --> 02:40:35,179
Every dog has its day.

1958
02:40:35,259 --> 02:40:41,839
Now there aren't any fakes.
No dud bullets. No dud pens.

1959
02:40:42,261 --> 02:40:45,623
Time to sign up. Come on.

1960
02:40:46,55 --> 02:40:47,28
Come on.

1961
02:40:48,596 --> 02:40:51,558
In any case, I stand to inherit
the property after you're gone.

1962
02:40:54,660 --> 02:40:56,125
Go on. Sit here, and sign it.

1963
02:40:56,775 --> 02:40:58,828
Let's finish off with
this legal things first.

1964
02:40:59,936 --> 02:41:02,940
So that there are no
hazels after you die.

1965
02:41:15,401 --> 02:41:16,519
Sir!

1966
02:41:26,616 --> 02:41:30,75
I have an old score
to settle. For my son!

1967
02:41:31,594 --> 02:41:33,125
Sir! Where are you going?

1968
02:41:33,205 --> 02:41:35,110
Not here, go there.

1969
02:41:35,590 --> 02:41:36,649
Poonam!

1970
02:41:36,729 --> 02:41:39,567
Will you tell it to me or not?

1971
02:41:40,432 --> 02:41:42,626
Yes, where were we?

1972
02:41:55,423 --> 02:41:57,140
Isn't that Mr. Talwar?

1973
02:41:58,431 --> 02:42:03,686
Dear, your name doesn't
suit your personality.

1974
02:42:04,100 --> 02:42:07,809
There won't be any
cause and no effect.

1975
02:42:10,431 --> 02:42:11,642
Get lost!

1976
02:42:14,637 --> 02:42:15,771
Poonam, I was telling you that..

1977
02:42:15,851 --> 02:42:18,173
..you did a very good
thing by saving Mr. Raja..

1978
02:42:18,365 --> 02:42:19,503
Hey, what are you doing?

1979
02:42:19,583 --> 02:42:22,170
Hey, don't pull me so hard.

1980
02:42:23,770 --> 02:42:26,540
Hey, hold me.

1981
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:29,435
You missed your target again.

1982
02:42:30,764 --> 02:42:31,806
Take this.

1983
02:42:34,378 --> 02:42:36,40
Yes, nice position.

1984
02:42:36,473 --> 02:42:38,170
Poonam, so where were we?

1985
02:42:44,862 --> 02:42:47,635
Yes! So you wanted this signed?

1986
02:42:47,911 --> 02:42:49,208
Why are you standing there? Come.

1987
02:42:49,288 --> 02:42:51,104
Don't be shy. Come here.
He's an old friend!

1988
02:42:51,184 --> 02:42:53,571
Yes, you want this to be signed?

1989
02:42:53,651 --> 02:42:55,442
Take this. I'll tear this will.

1990
02:42:55,727 --> 02:42:57,265
Here are your signatures.

1991
02:42:57,345 --> 02:42:59,103
Come on, on your feet.

1992
02:42:59,611 --> 02:43:00,703
Get up.

1993
02:43:04,511 --> 02:43:07,587
Here you are, you useless guy.

1994
02:43:10,678 --> 02:43:12,612
Take this.

1995
02:43:15,403 --> 02:43:18,408
Get up! Take this!

1996
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:21,908
Take this!

1997
02:43:24,235 --> 02:43:28,214
Finally, take this.

1998
02:43:31,102 --> 02:43:32,316
The Boss!

1999
02:43:37,619 --> 02:43:39,826
Arjun Singh!

2000
02:43:40,343 --> 02:43:41,421
Arjun Singh!

2001
02:43:41,501 --> 02:43:42,430
Boss.

2002
02:43:45,897 --> 02:43:46,834
Arjun Singh, what is this.

2003
02:43:48,149 --> 02:43:50,948
Breastplate, boss!

2004
02:43:55,69 --> 02:43:58,722
Arjun Singh, stop fooling!
- I'm sorry, boss!

2005
02:44:06,227 --> 02:44:07,394
Wait, brother.

2006
02:44:13,24 --> 02:44:14,410
Mr. Kirorimal!

2007
02:44:14,694 --> 02:44:18,571
Where is your big moustache?

2008
02:44:19,247 --> 02:44:20,410
What is the matter?

2009
02:44:23,449 --> 02:44:28,522
Mr. Kirorimal, now it
is not going to work.

2010
02:44:29,46 --> 02:44:30,702
I want all your teeth. Come here.

2011
02:44:30,988 --> 02:44:32,895
Please stand in front
of me. Right in front!

2012
02:44:40,865 --> 02:44:41,729
Oh God!

2013
02:44:43,124 --> 02:44:45,135
Forgive me. I'm not a pervert.

2014
02:44:45,215 --> 02:44:47,632
But you could dress properly,
you know. What?

2015
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:50,561
Wait!

2016
02:44:50,641 --> 02:44:53,438
There is a glass here.

2017
02:44:57,749 --> 02:45:00,304
That's what is
called through-the glass

2018
02:45:00,384 --> 02:45:02,941
I don't spare traitors!

2019
02:45:13,866 --> 02:45:16,725
Don't do what I told you.
This road leads nowhere.

2020
02:45:19,968 --> 02:45:21,968
Mr. Raja needs you.

2021
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:28,525
Don't leave him. Ever.

2022
02:45:32,66 --> 02:45:33,848
Stop right there, Arjun Singh!

2023
02:45:34,823 --> 02:45:39,441
lf you hit my daddy,
I'll behead her!

2024
02:45:44,56 --> 02:45:46,272
Your turn Mr. Raja. Come here.

2025
02:45:46,824 --> 02:45:49,148
You are all I need.

2026
02:45:49,699 --> 02:45:51,418
You have to sign the papers.

2027
02:45:51,775 --> 02:45:53,169
Come on!

2028
02:45:55,688 --> 02:45:57,504
No, sir. You mustn't!

2029
02:45:57,688 --> 02:46:00,88
No Arjun Singh,
Poonam is in danger!

2030
02:46:01,666 --> 02:46:02,856
That's good.

2031
02:46:03,991 --> 02:46:04,856
Come.

2032
02:46:11,403 --> 02:46:13,148
Come on..

2033
02:46:13,547 --> 02:46:15,255
Come, Mr. Raja.

2034
02:46:15,709 --> 02:46:17,331
Don't try to get smart.

2035
02:46:17,980 --> 02:46:21,222
Hands up. That's good.

2036
02:46:23,81 --> 02:46:24,400
Now get up in there.

2037
02:46:25,806 --> 02:46:30,941
Latch the other
cuff on the handlebar.

2038
02:46:32,616 --> 02:46:34,249
Throw me the keys.

2039
02:46:34,811 --> 02:46:35,579
Over here.

2040
02:46:35,784 --> 02:46:36,865
Yes.

2041
02:46:37,49 --> 02:46:39,16
Don't you move!

2042
02:47:16,782 --> 02:47:22,175
So Mr. Villain,
please take the cuffs off.

2043
02:47:22,683 --> 02:47:29,625
Else, you know what
happens to your daddy.

2044
02:47:30,425 --> 02:47:33,550
Let him go! Son! Let him go!
- Yes.

2045
02:47:33,723 --> 02:47:35,85
The keys are under the seat.

2046
02:47:49,984 --> 02:47:51,11
Come.

2047
02:47:52,531 --> 02:47:53,616
Come.

2048
02:47:54,524 --> 02:47:55,703
Come, come.

2049
02:47:56,826 --> 02:47:58,437
Thank you, boss!

2050
02:47:58,633 --> 02:48:00,135
Boss?
- Yes.

2051
02:48:00,215 --> 02:48:02,449
How about trading places?

2052
02:48:02,687 --> 02:48:06,190
From now, you're the boss.

2053
02:48:06,270 --> 02:48:07,163
Order me, boss.

2054
02:48:07,358 --> 02:48:10,731
So boss.. I mean Raja..

2055
02:48:11,357 --> 02:48:15,43
..first of all, you tie
the villain to his father.

2056
02:48:15,843 --> 02:48:16,762
Alright.

2057
02:48:16,978 --> 02:48:21,919
So that both the donkeys
are together when they die.

2058
02:48:22,395 --> 02:48:23,768
What next, boss?

2059
02:48:24,103 --> 02:48:25,519
The next is..

2060
02:48:26,222 --> 02:48:29,390
Deflate all the tires on
this truck. - Sure, boss.

2061
02:48:34,438 --> 02:48:40,179
Now you rascals, you'll tell me how
far the nearest police station is?

2062
02:48:40,600 --> 02:48:42,450
Two miles.
- Two miles.

2063
02:48:42,914 --> 02:48:44,298
And what do we have around here?

2064
02:48:45,22 --> 02:48:47,336
It is a jungle.
- Jungle.

2065
02:48:47,416 --> 02:48:50,319
And what do you find
in the jungles? Tigers.

2066
02:48:53,325 --> 02:48:56,175
What do we do now?
- What do we do now?

2067
02:48:56,255 --> 02:49:01,194
You don't need to do a thing.
Leave it to the tigers. - Yes.

2068
02:49:01,391 --> 02:49:05,183
I hope the tigers find
you before the cops.

2069
02:49:05,817 --> 02:49:06,680
Greeting.

2070
02:49:13,686 --> 02:49:17,886
Son, I have kept my promise.
And I have done my duty.

2071
02:49:18,450 --> 02:49:20,712
But I have a lot more to do in life.

2072
02:49:21,638 --> 02:49:23,484
I want your leave. For
a few days at least.

2073
02:49:23,801 --> 02:49:27,249
No, mother. You aren't
going anywhere alone.

2074
02:49:27,904 --> 02:49:29,335
We are all coming with you.

2075
02:49:29,415 --> 02:49:31,487
Oh! Thank God!

2076
02:49:31,567 --> 02:49:35,952
I came to town to see my grandson.
I had one. You've given me two.

2077
02:49:36,32 --> 02:49:37,541
And two brides to boot!

2078
02:49:37,621 --> 02:49:42,438
Let's hope I live to see the day
when you become grandfathers. Yes.

2079
02:49:43,392 --> 02:49:47,202
Tell me something,
grandpa. How did you get here?

2080
02:49:47,282 --> 02:49:51,157
Yes. Ask him.
- What's it, Bhairon?

2081
02:49:51,526 --> 02:49:53,644
Why should I tell you
that I sent him a letter!

2082
02:49:53,839 --> 02:49:55,720
Just a minute, please.
Let's have a family photo.

2083
02:49:55,800 --> 02:49:57,974
Come on. Arjun, you go behind.

2084
02:49:58,175 --> 02:50:00,694
Yes. Ready, smile.

2085
02:50:01,224 --> 02:50:05,516
Arjun, it is dawn, wake up.

2086
02:50:05,765 --> 02:50:07,398
Arjun! Get out of bed!

2087
02:50:07,523 --> 02:50:09,645
No! I won't let you go!

2088
02:50:09,726 --> 02:50:11,618
I will

2089
02:50:11,698 --> 02:50:14,96
You are my whole life!
- Daughter-in-law!

2090
02:50:14,176 --> 02:50:15,246
Daughter-in-law!

2091
02:50:15,326 --> 02:50:17,268
Come here quickly.

2092
02:50:17,349 --> 02:50:21,225
You wake him up from now on.
I will not do that.

2093
02:50:21,305 --> 02:50:24,490
lf I knew this would happen..
- You're old! At last!

2094
02:50:24,570 --> 02:50:26,257
It is you, your father, your..
