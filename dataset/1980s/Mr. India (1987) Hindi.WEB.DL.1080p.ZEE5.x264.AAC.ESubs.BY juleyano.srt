1
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,211
Please sit.

2
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:27,836
Gentlemen,

3
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:31,544
you are responsible officers
of all the defence services,

4
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,251
the police and intelligence
department.

5
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:38,430
The problem we're going to discuss
in this meeting is very serious.

6
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:44,051
Very dangerous. All that we speak
about it is insufficient.

7
00:02:44,483 --> 00:02:46,252
According to this
report of the CBI,

8
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:51,461
the powers spreading violence
and vandalism are on the rise.

9
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:55,252
Business groups who indulge
in black marketing.

10
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:00,340
And smugglers today smuggle
drugs as well as weapons.

11
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:05,371
They don't work separately.
It's a huge organization.

12
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,487
And there's a power outside
our country funding it.

13
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,573
Hail Mogambo!
- Hail Mogambo!

14
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:02,899
Hail Mogambo!

15
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,037
Hail Mogambo!
- Hail Mogambo!

16
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,483
Hail Mogambo!

17
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:42,712
Mr. Mogambo, after burning down
the government warehouses,

18
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:46,057
wherever there was shortage
of grains in the country,

19
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:49,932
adulterated goods has been
dispatched at black rates.

20
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:52,752
Mr. Mogambo,

21
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:58,893
about 100,000 gambling dens
and pubs have been opened!

22
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:04,540
We are making millions in profits
from the adulteration business.

23
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:20,965
Mogambo is pleased!

24
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,500
Daga! Teja!

25
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:33,254
Use this money to destroy and ruin
other things in the country.

26
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:37,441
These riots, killings, stabbings,

27
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,800
lootings and all this confusion!

28
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,204
If it continues
in this vein in India.

29
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:48,763
The day is not far,

30
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:52,975
when Mogambo's dream
will be realised!

31
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,332
Captain Zoro.

32
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,693
We want such a place on the
seacoast of Mumbai

33
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:03,509
from where we can send weapons
whenever and wherever we want.

34
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:06,348
Will it... be arranged?

35
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:07,550
Yes definitely
- Yes Sir.

36
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,690
Mogambo is pleased.

37
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:16,876
Senseless and illiterate Indians!

38
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:21,619
Till date they have learnt
nothing from their history!

39
00:06:22,812 --> 00:06:24,453
Whenever they fought
amongst themselves,

40
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,120
an outsider
was able to enslave them.

41
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:33,022
And still they fight amongst
themselves. So let them!

42
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:37,043
Let them fight in the name
of religion, caste and creed!

43
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,332
Mogambo will provide them
weapons to kill each other.

44
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,065
And when these Indians,

45
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:47,577
destroy the very
foundations of their country,

46
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:52,150
then I'll take my next step.

47
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,328
That day the whole country
will be at my feet!

48
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,536
And every Indian my slave!

49
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:01,953
All will say,
Hail Mogambo, the king of India!

50
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:04,798
Hail Mogambo, the king of India!

51
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,352
Hail Mogambo!
- Hail Mogambo!

52
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:10,894
Hail Mogambo!
- Hail Mogambo!

53
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:14,286
Mogambo is pleased!

54
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,369
You.

55
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,174
You.

56
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,531
You.

57
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:50,602
Hail Mogambo!

58
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:03,007
Jump.
- Hail Mogambo.

59
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:05,226
Jump.
- Hail Mogambo.

60
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:08,109
Jump.
- Hail Mogambo.

61
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,534
Mogambo... is pleased.

62
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,519
That's it!

63
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,602
The day I get the formula.

64
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:30,166
What formula?
- With the help of it,

65
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:35,611
a person becomes invisible!

66
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:40,110
Think! These soldiers
who obey my orders loyally,

67
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:44,124
who can confront them
if they can't be seen?

68
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:46,845
A formula which
renders a person invisible?

69
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:49,518
Doctor Fumancho!

70
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,685
20 years ago an Indian scientist
had invented this formula.

71
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,433
He died but never gave
that formula to anyone.

72
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,708
A formula which renders
a person invisible?

73
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:02,313
How is it possible?

74
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:06,397
And why not? Science has
progressed in leaps and bounds.

75
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:09,928
It's wrong to say what's impossible
today will always be impossible.

76
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:13,742
I am not going too far in history,
about 100-150 years.

77
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:18,786
Those days if someone claimed
that steel planes would fly...

78
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:22,423
Going 1000 miles in a few hours
people would call him crazy.

79
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,366
But planes were made,

80
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,168
and no one questions
their existence.

81
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,690
If King Akbar would have been told

82
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,803
about telephones, radios,
motor cars...

83
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,331
he would not believe it.

84
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:41,681
The fact is, we are unwilling to
believe which we haven't seen.

85
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:43,425
If somebody said,

86
00:09:43,821 --> 00:09:47,265
that it was possible to take
pictures of your insides,

87
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:51,162
then people laughed as you do now.

88
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,740
But X-rays are quite normal today.

89
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,505
Sir.
- Yes Raman.

90
00:09:56,808 --> 00:10:00,523
Just as X-rays help you to look
at the insides of a person.

91
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:05,891
Can science invent something which
will turn a person invisible?

92
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,320
What...

93
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,191
What a stupid question?
You can't make such a thing!

94
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,754
But sir you said science...
- Please sit down!

95
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,083
This is no time for jokes.
Sit down!

96
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:33,075
Doctor Jagdish Varma we want,

97
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:36,700
you to give us the formula.
- No way!

98
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:42,060
Don't be stupid!
If you remain adamant,

99
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:46,902
your assistant Professor Sinha
will give it to us at any cost.

100
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,534
That's why don't be so foolish!

101
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:54,210
Give us the formula
and we'll pay you in millions.

102
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,455
You can't buy me out!
I'll call the police right now!

103
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,357
No!
- Mr. Sinha?

104
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:04,006
Catch him! Don't let him escape!

105
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,268
Sir!

106
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,856
Raman? What's the matter?

107
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:22,464
I upset you in class today,
so I...

108
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:24,189
No, it's not a big deal.

109
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,105
Actually I made a mistake.

110
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,564
Your question was right.

111
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,314
But only he has
the right to answer it.

112
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:36,064
Who is he?

113
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,689
He was a great scientist.

114
00:11:40,537 --> 00:11:44,558
You might recall I had
introduced you to his son, Arun.

115
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,272
He is Arun's father.
Do you remember?

116
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:50,822
Sir the one with many kids.
- Yes that's him.

117
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,358
He spent his
childhood without parents.

118
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:55,981
He feels their pain.

119
00:11:56,773 --> 00:12:01,610
When he sees an orphan,
he takes them home with him.

120
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:05,049
His house is but a mini hostel.

121
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,910
Calendar, oh! Calendar

122
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,713
Oh no the egg... Calendar!

123
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,669
Hey Calendar.

124
00:12:12,272 --> 00:12:13,454
What's the matter Arun brother...

125
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:17,485
What is it Arun brother, like a
madman are you yelling for me?

126
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:23,031
I don't understand why did your
parents named you Calendar.

127
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,454
They wanted to keep a name
in English.

128
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,978
If your name would have been Queen
Elizabeth instead of Calendar...

129
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,573
then too you would
have been a cook.

130
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:32,943
Where did you vanish?

131
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,564
Well I vanished in my room.

132
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,698
Vanish wherever you want.

133
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:40,763
But inspite of you being here, why
do I have to cook all the time.

134
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,004
Why Calendar?

135
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,004
Come on... tell me...
Answer me.

136
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,411
Your luck is such Arun brother.
I don't there is anybody's mistake.

137
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,588
The mistake is - you do not know
difference between sleep and death.

138
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,421
People who sleep, wake up
You refuse to wake up.

139
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,986
Look Calendar, If you get up late
tomorrow morning...

140
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,305
Then something or the other would
surely get cut from your salary.

141
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,560
Sure... Please cut it.

142
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,805
Atleast I will get a salary
because of this.

143
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,171
By god, its been five years,
years,

144
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,644
that I haven't got my salary.

145
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:11,271
How does it look like?
Its purple like a brinjal.

146
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,190
Really?

147
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,425
Big brother let me tell you the
morning news before you leave.

148
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,633
The groceries are on the verge of
being extinct ib the house.

149
00:13:16,753 --> 00:13:19,959
We will bring some
from the grocers.

150
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,144
Second news,

151
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:23,494
landlord came for rent.

152
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,967
We will give it too,
We aer not running away anywhere.

153
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:28,845
The kids have showered?
Yes, did so yesterday, right now

154
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:31,840
they must be sleeping in their beds
sweet dreams.

155
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,260
Good morning children!

156
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,384
Good morning children!

157
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:44,836
Good morning children!

158
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:29,898
Good morning children!

159
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,663
Good morning! Good morning!

160
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:35,323
Children get up quick! Come down!

161
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:36,891
Good morning!
- Breakfast is ready!

162
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:39,687
Go to the bathroom,
one by one. Get ready.

163
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:41,750
Brush your teeth, c'mon,

164
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,459
C'mon Jugal. Hurry up!

165
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:46,339
Brother Arun, wouldn't it be
better if there were,

166
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,626
no rains every morning?

167
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,844
It's even better if you wake on
your own to get ready for school.

168
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:56,894
Why do we have school
so early in the morning?

169
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:59,212
Because everything starts
early in the morning.

170
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,911
Life sleeps all night
and awakes in the morning.

171
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:05,084
If we have to keep pace with life,
we have to get up early!

172
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:08,822
Brother Arun, why Monday
always follows Sunday?

173
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:13,124
Just as sorrow
follows joy and vice versa,

174
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:15,226
the day follows the night,

175
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:17,246
that's why Sunday
is followed by Monday.

176
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,805
And Saturday is followed by?
- Sunday!

177
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,800
Sunday!

178
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:52,364
"Life's like that."

179
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:57,446
"You win only after you've lost."

180
00:15:57,566 --> 00:16:02,214
"Life's like that."

181
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:06,853
"You win only after you've lost."

182
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:12,291
"Some tears and a few smiles."

183
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:17,238
"If there's sorrow today,
tomorrow will be bright."

184
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:22,247
"Life's like that."

185
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,025
"You win only after you've lost."

186
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:32,150
"Some tears and a few smiles."

187
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:37,133
"If there's sorrow today,
tomorrow will be bright."

188
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:42,247
"Life's like that."

189
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:47,233
"You win only after you've lost."

190
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,023
"Life is night also
Life is day also."

191
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:30,144
"Life is night also
Life is day also."

192
00:17:30,264 --> 00:17:35,041
"Life is a journey,
Life is also a abode."

193
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:40,741
"Life is a journey,
Life is also a abode."

194
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:45,106
"One moment there is pain
from a wound."

195
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:50,046
"The next moment there is a
shade of happiness."

196
00:17:50,408 --> 00:17:55,153
"In every new moment there
is a new song."

197
00:17:55,462 --> 00:18:00,707
"This is the way of life."

198
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:44,862
"When sorrows bother you."

199
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:49,751
"You should keep on smiling."

200
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:54,201
"When sorrows bother you."

201
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:59,756
"You should keep on smiling."

202
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:09,529
"There should always
be hope in your eyes."

203
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,550
"For today's loss
will be tomorrow's gain."

204
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,568
"Fortune changes in no time."

205
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:24,512
"Time is your friend."

206
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:29,445
"Life's like that."

207
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:39,165
"Life's like that.
You win only after you've lost."

208
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:44,227
"Some tears and a few smiles."

209
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:49,123
"If there's sorrow today,
tomorrow will be bright."

210
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:58,719
"Life's like that.
You win only after you've lost."

211
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:04,475
Budhwa, you lazy bones,
carry all those sacks in quickly!

212
00:20:04,595 --> 00:20:05,823
Why are you working so slowly?

213
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:11,006
Good day Mr. Roopchand!
- I'm doomed!

214
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:13,529
You're back! Again?

215
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,527
You'll shutdown my shop
by taking things on credit!

216
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:19,202
I'll be ruined if this goes on.

217
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:24,423
May your rivals get ruined!
I always pray that you prosper.

218
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:26,029
I'm doomed!

219
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:26,979
Hi Roop.

220
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,368
Oh hi.

221
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:31,796
I thought I'd make
all your payments together.

222
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,380
What do you think?

223
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,681
Full payment?

224
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:37,327
You?

225
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:45,077
He's laughing! He started laughing
when you speak of money.

226
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:48,611
Don't stand there. Take the rice,
wheat and everything you want.

227
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,762
It's Roopchand's shop.

228
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,830
Accountant, add it to my account.

229
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,921
Every month I think I should
stop giving you things on credit.

230
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:00,659
But my heart is so soft..
- You've a big heart!

231
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,077
Else who gives food-grains as
cheap as pebbles and stones?

232
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,374
1 kg of rice contains
half a kg of stones.

233
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:10,150
The price for rice, wheat and
pebbles is the same in your shop.

234
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,902
Isn't that wonderful?
- I'm doomed!

235
00:21:14,277 --> 00:21:18,734
You find pebbles in my rice
and wheat? Go to another shop!

236
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:22,901
Mr. Roopchand, how can we go?
We are used to it.

237
00:21:23,112 --> 00:21:27,085
Until we gnash a couple of pebbles,
we don't relish the meal.

238
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:31,150
Brother Arun, we must go home.
I have to cook.

239
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,960
Before cooking I've to pick
the rice out of the pebbles.

240
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,631
Ok Mr. Roopchand,
full payment in a couple of days.

241
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,609
Shall I leave?
I've to go for music tuitions.

242
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,860
Bye Roop, thanks.

243
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,563
I'm doomed!

244
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:17,568
This is the house.

245
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:19,610
I see! This is it.

246
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,401
Mr. Teja, we must
have this house at any cost.

247
00:22:23,588 --> 00:22:24,949
Why? Why this house?

248
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:26,984
Mr. Mogambo had said,

249
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:31,064
he wants a place where he can send
any amount of weapons to India.

250
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,037
C'mon.
- Don't worry Mr. Daga.

251
00:22:33,157 --> 00:22:35,109
I'll get it vacated in no time.

252
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,026
How?
- Wait and watch.

253
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:39,109
I've a pawn in this locality.

254
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,727
Mr. Teja consider it done.

255
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,002
Curse me if I can't do it.

256
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:45,007
Tolaram!

257
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:50,526
Have you got black pebbles to mix
in the black lentils? - Yes.

258
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,364
Black pebbles for black lentils,

259
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:54,156
white pebbles for rice

260
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,010
and brown for the wheat.

261
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,846
We've got 100 sacks of each.

262
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:03,644
The Boss'business is doubling
everyday By the grace of God.

263
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:05,538
Why? Aren't you benefiting too?

264
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:08,815
With your grace, yes l am.

265
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:12,119
Sir shall I take your leave?
- Yes leave.

266
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:14,323
Yes.
- But I want the house vacated.

267
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:17,078
The owner, Maniklal works for us.

268
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:21,370
We'll get him round. You want
the house and you'll get it.

269
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,585
Vacate the house?
Mankilal, what are you saying?

270
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,864
You've heard me right.

271
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:29,875
Just think it over.
We've been living here since years.

272
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:34,787
Why should I? Why shouln't I think
about the rent you haven't paid?

273
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:38,744
I'll pay the rent but..
- You've to pay it!

274
00:23:39,188 --> 00:23:40,537
Look at this notice.

275
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:44,287
Pay up all that you owe me
or vacate the house.

276
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:46,287
You're doomed now!

277
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:49,916
You can't pay that much money.
You'll have to leave the house!

278
00:23:50,036 --> 00:23:51,329
Let's go Mr. Maniklal.

279
00:23:52,954 --> 00:23:54,037
Take this.

280
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:55,162
Get it?

281
00:23:57,774 --> 00:24:00,281
If we don't pay our dues,

282
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,329
we'll really lose this house.

283
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:06,030
And these kids?
Where do I take them?

284
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:09,722
Brother Arun I've an idea.

285
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,841
What if we rent out the room on the
top floor? I mean paying guest!

286
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:16,745
Sounds good.
- Of course!

287
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:20,130
I'll give an
advertisement right away.

288
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:22,448
**Typewriter clicking... office
chatter**

289
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:24,175
How can l tolerate this?

290
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:27,579
Still you don't know,
how to use the grammar.

291
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,238
You have been in this office since
10 years but...

292
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:33,013
You don't know anything...
you don't have any sense at all.

293
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,754
Hello.
- Ruby Talkies?

294
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,149
What? No need to print

295
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,490
No need to print.
- Look mam I am not talking to you.

296
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,612
Listen, can you book tickets for
my matinee show.

297
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,699
I cannot book the tickets
for your matinee show.

298
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,239
Its Ruby Talkies right?

299
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,493
Look this is not Ruby talkies, this
is Crime's of India paper office.

300
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:51,875
Why don't you try to understand?

301
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:53,882

Now please for god's sake,
Please for god's sake.

00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:25,990
Hari Om

00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,492
Did she come?

00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,714
That girl... what's her name?

312
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,829
Its that girl
- Which girl Sir?

313
00:25:32,111 --> 00:25:33,738
That same girl you fool...

314
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,731
Crime times of India.

315
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,848
Type this and send it to the
editor's table today itself.

316
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,134
Sorry...

317
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:44,220
Sorry is like an escape for some.
Ruin everything and say sorry.

318
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:48,140
Mr. Gupta... why is this news item
still lying on my table.

319
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,673
Why didn't you give it to me
along with the other papers.

320
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:50,612
I am sorry

321
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:51,675
Again Sorry!

Sorry... sorrry... sorry
Ecxcuse me.

324
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,985
Good morning Sir.
- Come in Seema please come.

325
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:04,138
I have brought the article which
you gave me to write.

326
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,818
You brought it... good.

327
00:26:06,422 --> 00:26:07,991
Oh but, why did you keep it on the
chair.

328
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:09,511
You are sitting on the table.

329
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,766
So I thought of keeping the papers
on the table.

330
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,009
I am sorry.

331
00:26:16,716 --> 00:26:18,129
My Pajamas are not washed properly.

332
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:21,624
Okay so if your Pajamas are not
washed properly, what shall I do?

333
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:23,782
This is not any Bharat Laundry...
Its a wrong Number.

334
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,643
But... you this

335
00:26:29,193 --> 00:26:32,129
This article can't be
printed this Sunday.

336
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:36,193
You've delayed it.
- Obviously, it is delayed.

337
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,561
The landlord of the house
where I live, has kids.

338
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:41,385
And I can't work around kids.

339
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:43,609
I'm looking for a new house.

340
00:26:43,806 --> 00:26:44,666
Please have a sit.

341
00:26:44,786 --> 00:26:46,081
Sir, Why do kids even exist?

342
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:48,769
Hoe could it would have been.
If everybody were born as an adult,

343
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:57,897
I agree with you.

344
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,131
Now do you have some work for me?

345
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,619
Yes, there's a job for you.
Very interesting job.

346
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:07,077
A criminal has just
been released from jail.

347
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:10,499
He's 25 but has been
to jail 50 times!

348
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:12,166
What's his name?
- His name is Manglu.

349
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:13,985
I've sent Khanna
to get him to the office.

350
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:17,661
Take his interview, readers will
read it with great interest!

351
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,215
Hello, Crimes of India.
- Sir!

352
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:21,912
Yes!

353
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,834
Madam!
I've a house with a spare room.

354
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,465
I want to give an advertisement.
- Go to that room.

355
00:27:28,318 --> 00:27:30,536
Give me 4 copies of this.

356
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,862
So, It's you?

357
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:40,591
Yes it's me.

358
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:42,006
Please sit down.

359
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:45,514
Please!

360
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:48,786
Pencil!

361
00:27:48,966 --> 00:27:50,591
Speak your mind.

362
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:53,174
Don't be scared.

363
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,466
Why should I be?
It's a matter of joy.

364
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:58,758
Good!

365
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,215
Well.

366
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:02,388
Sorry.

367
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:06,598
Ok tell me one thing, since
when have you been like this?

368
00:28:07,226 --> 00:28:08,883
I've been like this
since childhood.

369
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,851
Since childhood?

370
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:14,302
I see.

371
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:18,232
Why do you do what you do?

372
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,059
For money! Simple!

373
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,501
Actually I'm not happy.

374
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:25,895
But sometimes one has to go
against his wishes to earn money.

375
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,177
Helplessness you know.

376
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:30,588
You think all those
who are helpless become thieves?

377
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,308
No, many are honest.

378
00:28:32,528 --> 00:28:36,380
You get all types of people.
That's life.

379
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:42,916
Ok. What was your age
when you first went to prison?

380
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:45,361
I must've been...

381
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,634
What are you saying? Me? Prison?

382
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:52,158
Haven't you been
imprisoned 50 times?

383
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,118
50? Who told you?

384
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:56,371
So how many times have you been
there

385
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:58,553
I did not go to the jai
even once.

386
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:00,586
But why do you want me to send me
to the jail.

387
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,810
Is this a newspaper office or a
police station? - Don't shout.

388
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,638
What do you mean?

389
00:29:04,758 --> 00:29:06,359
Look Manglu.
- Manglu?

390
00:29:06,922 --> 00:29:09,167
What Manglu? Who Manglu?
Whose Manglu?

391
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:11,710
My name is Arun Varma!
- Arun?

392
00:29:12,491 --> 00:29:15,536
If you're not Manglu then
what are you doing in this room?

393
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:18,952
You too are here and I don't
think you're Manglu either.

394
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,501
I'm the crime reporter.

395
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,353
Who are you? Why are you here?

396
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:26,001
What do you want? - To print an
advertisement about a room on rent.

397
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,253
But now I want to leave! Goodbye!

398
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:31,367
One...
- Careful.

399
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,986
What are you doing? - Does
the lady in red-white work here?

400
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:36,308
Come here.
- She's back again.

401
00:29:36,428 --> 00:29:37,317
Are you married?

402
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:39,918
I didn't come here
to advertise in the matrimonies.

403
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:41,701
I know that, sorry.

404
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:45,234
I just want to know
if you have kids.

405
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:46,626
I'll have kids when I marry.

406
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,758
Of course.
- Sir, make her understand.

407
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:50,827
Listen! Just listen to me.

408
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:54,251
Give me the room
you want to rent out.

409
00:29:54,781 --> 00:29:55,764
Yes.

410
00:29:56,923 --> 00:29:58,089
Then say so.

411
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,545
Madam, what a room!

412
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,473
Lovely room.
A balcony in front of it.

413
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,167
A garden in front of the balcony
and then the sea.

414
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,837
Cool breeze all day long.
Madam, that too absolutely free!

415
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:11,791
I've taken it.
- Without taking a look at it?

416
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,704
The moment you said no kids,
I decided. Here's Rs. 500.

417
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,292
But the kids?
- You don't have any, do you?

418
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:22,834
That's why I'm taking it.

419
00:30:25,661 --> 00:30:29,074
Fine, the room is yours.
God will take care of the rest.

420
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,556
Here we are!

421
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:36,303
Madam have a look!
I was talking about this.

422
00:30:36,512 --> 00:30:38,345
"Build a beautiful bungalow."

423
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:40,347
Calendar!
- Calendar?

424
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,352
Calendar the cook.

425
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:48,545
Did you notice it? It's so
beautiful and peaceful around here!

426
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,774
Calendar, have all
the arrangements been made?

427
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:52,718
Yes the kids...

428
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:54,349
Kids?
- Not the kids.

429
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:58,506
I meant all the bags.

430
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,313
I've arranged all the small
and big suitcases.

431
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:05,113
Enter madam. Enter!

432
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:09,755
Thank god!

433
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,924
Brother Arun the coast is clear!

434
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:12,880
What?

435
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,803
He is speaking about
the cleanliness in your room.

436
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:21,404
What a beautiful? what a lovely?
What a peace.

437
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,135
What a peaceful house?

438
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:29,500
And its so quiet here

439
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:34,294
What do you think?
- Yes

440
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:36,702
If there is peace where I live,

441
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,188
it would help my work a lot.

442
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:45,232
You have come at the right place,
here you will crave to hear humans.

443
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:52,256
Shall we go upstairs?
I'll show you your room.

444
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,737
What happened?
- Shall we go upstairs?

445
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:01,898
Yes.

446
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,696
Can you see this?
These stairs go up.

447
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:11,237
Then they also come down.

448
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:13,352
It's amazing! Very nice.

449
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:15,482
Everything is looked after.

450
00:32:15,774 --> 00:32:17,799
C'mon madam.

451
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,315
Calendar!
- Yes brother Arun.

452
00:32:24,582 --> 00:32:27,048
Have you kept all the bags
in the right place? - Yes.

453
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,237
But what about
the little bags downstairs?

454
00:32:31,357 --> 00:32:33,987
Something will be done.
- Yes.

455
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:37,732
Take care. It's in your hands now.

456
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,238
Madam!

457
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,898
How is the room?

458
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:44,232
Madam!

459
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,246
Nice.

460
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:50,130
I can write ghost stories here!

461
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:53,947
What's wrong?

462
00:32:58,232 --> 00:33:00,737
What happened?
- Cockroach!

463
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:03,813
Cockroach!
- Cockroach!

464
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,555
Where is the cockroach?

465
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:08,107
Where is the cockroach?

466
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,148
It's looking at me!

467
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,767
You're scared of a cockroach?

468
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:18,360
I'm not scared of lions.

469
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,689
But yes, I fear cockroaches!

470
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,950
I'm not scared.
Why get scared of a cockroach?

471
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:29,806
Call somebody who will kill it!

472
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,369
I will but they're all kids!

473
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:35,640
Call them! At least
we'll get rid of this pest!

474
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,640
The cockroach will die!
But the kids will remain.

475
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,676
Whatever it is, just think.
- Quickly call somebody!

476
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:44,600
Children! Help!

477
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:46,430
Cockroach!

478
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,265
Cockroach!
- Children! Help!

479
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:53,418
Help!

480
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,052
Children! Help!

481
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:02,367
Cockroach!

482
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:12,040
My god!

483
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,748
Madam take care.
- What's going on?

484
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:19,503
What are kids doing here?
- Killing the cockroach.

485
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,051
O god you fraud!

486
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:23,553
You said, you don't have kids!
- I was right.

487
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:25,505
They're not mine.
- You rogue!

488
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:29,590
I'll report you to the police!
Take you to Supreme Court!

489
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,095
Sure!

490
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:34,875
Look, how much trouble these
little kids are taking for you.

491
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,608
They will not spare the pest!
They've caught!

492
00:34:40,597 --> 00:34:43,514
You took 500 bucks then

493
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,042
and a deposit later.

494
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:51,585
I want all my money back.
Right now!

495
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:53,872
But we spent that money.

496
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:01,717
Cockroach!

497
00:35:01,837 --> 00:35:05,075
Deepu, Tina! Kids run!

498
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:06,743
Get lost!

499
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:08,385
Madam!

500
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:11,844
You cheat! - Stay here until
you get your money's worth.

501
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,629
If you want you can stay longer!

502
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,884
The room is not so bad.
Room with a balcony.

503
00:35:17,004 --> 00:35:20,129
A garden beyond the balcony
and then the sea.

504
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,266
Mr. Sinha, you always used to say
that dad was a great scientist.

505
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,765
And he had made something which is
one of it's kind in the world.

506
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:38,390
What was it?

507
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:41,349
What was it?

508
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,891
I don't tell people because
I know they won't believe me.

509
00:35:46,682 --> 00:35:50,682
But since you're his son,
I'll tell you.

510
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,099
He had created a gadget.

511
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,974
Wear it on the wrist, switch it on
and the person becomes invisible.

512
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:01,891
Person becomes invisible?
How is that possible?

513
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:05,629
Why don't you see someone in the
dark? - If there's no light then..

514
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,022
Why can he be seen
only when there's light?

515
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:10,515
I'll tell you.

516
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:14,950
When light reflects from a body
and enters our eyes,

517
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:17,437
we are able to see the person.

518
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:20,973
If something can create
a reaction in our body,

519
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:24,509
whereby instead of reflecting,
light goes through the body

520
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:26,308
then a person can't be seen.

521
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:32,687
Didn't understand?
For example a glass.

522
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:37,432
Light goes through the glass
so you can't see it.

523
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:42,774
I think you don't believe me.

524
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:46,257
No, Mr. Sinha! If you are saying..

525
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:51,666
But where's the gadget that sends
light through our bodies?

526
00:36:53,898 --> 00:36:57,865
Your dad knew
that it could be misused.

527
00:36:58,056 --> 00:37:01,593
So he burnt the formula.

528
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:04,704
But where is the gadget?
You have it?

529
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,786
Forget it.

530
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,750
You were looking
for a paying guest.

531
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:10,468
Found anyone?

532
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,531
We've found a girl.

533
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:15,967
And what a girl! Wonderful.

534
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:34,899
Stop it... Stop it
- (Children screaming and playing)

535
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:39,202
If you don't stop making noise now,
I will file a complaint against you

536
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,786
You would land up in jail,
wearing handcuffs.

537
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:43,872
What do you mean by jail?

538
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:50,979
Welcome, You have come at the right
look whats happening over here.

539
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,933
Arun brother,
we will be wearing a handcuff.

540
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,932
What happened Madam?
- You are asking me, what happened?

541
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:04,044
When you told me there is a room,
a balcony and a garden outside it.

542
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:07,418
You didn't tell me that there
would be kids playing football too

543
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:10,665
I am sorry Madam, they won't make
any noise.

544
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,701
Thank you very much... Thank you!

545
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,505
I told you right?... that don't
make noise over here.

546
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,009
But brother we also stay here,
shouldn't we play here?

547
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:21,922
What does she think of herself?,
that she is warning us like this.

548
00:38:22,072 --> 00:38:24,372
What does she think of us...
Its not done.

549
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:26,714
She is always yelling at us.

550
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:28,724
I don't mean to say that,

551
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:30,809
but don't play here,
go to the beach.

552
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:33,432
Infact I will also come
with you guys to play on the beach.

553
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:37,235
Yay!!... hey catch it... lets go
- (Cheers)

554
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,961
Madam... I am sorry Madam.

555
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:53,894
Its my fault.

556
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:55,879
Madam...
atleast listen to me once Madam.

557
00:38:57,223 --> 00:38:59,522
Madam, this time its not the kids.

558
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:02,942
But it was me... who... i did...
- Yes... Yes I know very well.

559
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,906
All of this is a plot against me,
a scheme, a plan

560
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,457
this plan
would not be successful even

561
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,498
if kids around the world unite

562
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:13,861
Mr. Arun Verma...
I will sue you for this.

563
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,973
Now this football will be presented
in the court

564
00:39:16,093 --> 00:39:19,337
But why in the court, football
isn't played in the court.

565
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:22,851
I will see...
I will see you in the court

566
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:25,353
Madam...
madam atleast listen to me.

567
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,207
I won't... I won't spare you now.

568
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,142
Won't spare you at all.

569
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:34,104
How dare you?

570
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,460
I will drag him in the court.

571
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:44,024
"We don't want gold or silver,
we don't want a apology."

572
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:47,485
"Look we hold our ears
to say you sorry."

573
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,909
"We don't want gold or silver,
we don't want a apology."

574
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:57,890
"Look we hold our ears
to say you sorry."

575
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:03,766
"Our ball that you are holding,
is very dear to us."

576
00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:08,800
"Our ball that you are holding,
is very dear to us."

577
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:17,552
"Come on now give it, give it to
us, that football oh dear sister."

578
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:28,233
"Come on now give it, give it to
us, that football oh dear sister."

579
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:33,560
"Give that football, back to us."

580
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,050
"Give that football, back to us."

581
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:45,261
"All of you keep irritating me,
all day and night."

582
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:50,176
"Even if you try to request
touching my feet today."

583
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:55,777
"I won't give you the football."

584
00:40:55,897 --> 00:41:02,274
"I won't give you the football."

585
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:10,326
"All of you keep irritating me,
all day and night."

586
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:16,651
"Sorry, sister now we will never
make any nose."

587
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:20,624
Not nose dear...
its noise... noise.

588
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:26,792
"Sorry, sister now we will never
make any noise."

589
00:41:26,912 --> 00:41:33,361
"But if kids don't play, they will
get bored."

590
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:41,778
"Sorry, sister now we will never
make any noise."

591
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:48,002
"But if kids don't play, they will
get bored."

592
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:09,767
"Oh stop it now stop it,
I know this is a drama of yours."

593
00:42:10,158 --> 00:42:14,386
"This is all a fake story."

594
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:19,008
"Girl you too are not that
innocent..."

595
00:42:19,128 --> 00:42:23,454
"You are the head of
their regiment."

596
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:28,005
"I know this is a drama of yours."

597
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:35,411
"Between you and my kids."

598
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:41,030
"What kind of a fight is this..."

599
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,541
"What kind of a fight is."

600
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:51,765
"What's this affair about, please
do let me know too."

601
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:57,226
"What's this affair about,
please do let me know too."

602
00:42:57,346 --> 00:43:07,232
"Between you and my kids,
What kind of a fight is this..."

603
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:15,482
"Oh our cap wearing brother,
help us get the ball."

604
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:23,382
"Oh our cap wearing brother,
help us get the ball."

605
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:30,509
"Don't know why this sister is
annoyed at us."

606
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:38,044
"Get us our ball."

607
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:46,052
"Oh our cap wearing brother,
Oh our cap wearing brother."

608
00:43:46,297 --> 00:43:50,679
"Oh our cap wearing brother."

609
00:43:51,717 --> 00:43:57,665
"My name is calendar,
I will go now into the kitchen."

610
00:45:56,816 --> 00:45:57,807
I got the ball.

611
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:01,249
Yay!... Lets go.

612
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:49,273
Welcome Mr. Maniklal.

613
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:51,107
I've come.

614
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:56,232
But remember one thing that today
the period of grace expires.

615
00:46:56,427 --> 00:47:00,177
Either pay me the rent
or vacate the house right now.

616
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:02,142
Either pay the rent?

617
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,148
Or vacate?
- Yes.

618
00:47:04,457 --> 00:47:08,335
In that case if I've to choose,
I'll pay the rent.

619
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:09,690
What?
- Ok.

620
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,070
Entire amount!
- Anything to drink?

621
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,895
Goodbye.

622
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:21,959
You mean you couldn't
vacate the house?

623
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:26,017
Roopchand, why shouldn't
I empty your shop?

624
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:28,093
Now I'm doomed!

625
00:47:28,283 --> 00:47:30,967
Teja darling,
your blood pressure will rise.

626
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:33,022
Mr. Teja,
you're needlessly getting worried!

627
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:35,424
Karga runs a gambling
den for us in that area.

628
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:37,947
He'll take some men
and what's his name?

629
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:40,835
He'll beat him
and his kids and throw them out.

630
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:44,570
What is the problem?
- Sir, wait for a few days.

631
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,882
Why? What will you do?

632
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:50,815
I'll strangle him
so bad that he'll leave!

633
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:54,967
If they starve,
they'll surely vacate the house!

634
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:58,197
Calendar! Give us food!

635
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:01,295
Calendar! Give us food!

636
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:04,579
Calendar! Give us food!

637
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:07,658
Calendar! Give us food!

638
00:48:07,778 --> 00:48:10,729
Quiet children!

639
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:13,215
Why are you raising hell?

640
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:17,360
Calendar, we'll scream
until we get food.

641
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,768
Am I right brothers?
- Yes!

642
00:48:18,888 --> 00:48:21,868
Calendar! Give us food!

643
00:48:21,988 --> 00:48:23,454
Jugal!
- Shut up!

644
00:48:23,574 --> 00:48:26,131
Change yourself!
I swear, I'm right.

645
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:30,036
If you instigate people like this,
someday you'll become a leader!

646
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:32,099
Thank you Calendar.
- Shut up!

647
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:35,838
We are hungry.
- But I just have two hands.

648
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:37,707
It takes time to cook.

649
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,330
Calendar give us food!

650
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,089
Calendar! Give us food!

651
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:44,731
Kummi, help me out in the kitchen.

652
00:48:44,851 --> 00:48:46,747
Can't you all keep quiet?

653
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:49,960
Can't you all keep quiet?
- Calendar give us food!

654
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:54,141
Look at this!

655
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:57,860
There's neither flour nor rice
or lentil.

656
00:48:58,606 --> 00:49:01,046
How do I explain to you kids?

657
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:06,560
Isn't there anything?
- Can't you see these empty tins?

658
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:10,100
I swear, I can't tolerate
to see the kids like this!

659
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:13,239
Now something can be done
only when Arun returns.

660
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:18,125
Can't we stay hungry for a day?

661
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:28,257
If there's nothing here why don't
you get it from Roopchand's shop?

662
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,623
I had gone there this morning...

663
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,040
but only brother Arun
can convince him.

664
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:35,376
You won't die
if you don't eat for a day.

665
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:37,710
And if I die?

666
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:42,212
Tina, we'll eat goodies
when brother Arun returns.

667
00:49:42,332 --> 00:49:43,312
Ok.

668
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:55,848
Brother Arun!

669
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:01,215
Brother Arun I won't die.

670
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,793
If I don't eat for a day,
I won't die.

671
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:09,332
You didn't have your meal?
- Calendar didn't serve us.

672
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,316
Calendar!

673
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,024
Calendar!

674
00:50:23,211 --> 00:50:24,113
You're too much!

675
00:50:24,233 --> 00:50:26,558
The kids haven't eaten
and you didn't serve them!

676
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:28,392
I couldn't help it.

677
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:30,389
Thought I'd bring groceries
from Roopchand.

678
00:50:30,509 --> 00:50:32,470
But he said..
- He might have asked for money!

679
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:37,274
No problem kids. I've the money.

680
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:39,565
I've got the tuition fees.

681
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,646
Just wait for 15 minutes.

682
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:46,481
I'll go and get lots to eats. Ok?

683
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,410
What do you mean?
What sin have I committed?

684
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:53,029
I'm running a
business not charity!

685
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:56,018
Want something?
Pay up and take the groceries.

686
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,634
I've the money, here!

687
00:50:57,974 --> 00:50:59,527
I'm doomed.

688
00:50:59,647 --> 00:51:02,774
I've always paid
you sooner or later.

689
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:05,947
But the children were hungry
because I wasn't home.

690
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,124
The entire sum.
- Yes it is.

691
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,699
That clears our account to date.

692
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:15,031
Thank you very much.

693
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,279
What are you waiting for?
Get lost!

694
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,348
Give me the groceries!

695
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:21,669
Got money for it?

696
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,649
I cleared all your dues.

697
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:26,499
So that you could
take credit again?

698
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:30,712
I want cash or else
I won't give you anything!

699
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:33,084
Don't do this.

700
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:35,634
The kids are hungry at home.

701
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,445
What can I do? Let them die today
instead of tomorrow! Swines!

702
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:39,407
Roopchand!
- Help!

703
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:41,693
I'm doomed!
Raghu! Bansi! Help me!

704
00:51:41,813 --> 00:51:42,671
Let me go!

705
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,096
If you abuse my kids I'll...

706
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:47,923
Throw that rascal out!

707
00:51:48,043 --> 00:51:52,155
Strides into my shop
as if it were his own!

708
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,860
I gave him groceries on credit
and now he attacks me!

709
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:07,439
Have I ever denied you,

710
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,850
but the fact,
I don't have money today.

711
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:11,715
That's the issue in giving a job,
to people like you.

712
00:52:11,835 --> 00:52:14,038
Take all your stuff out of here,
we don't want your tuitions.

713
00:52:14,158 --> 00:52:17,349
Leave your car in the garage,
If it sells then we will pay you.

714
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:19,484
I just can't you an advance,
for a crap like this.

715
00:52:39,106 --> 00:52:41,263
Arun Brother hasn't come yet.

716
00:52:45,805 --> 00:52:48,060
My dear, let's wait for some time.

717
00:52:48,852 --> 00:52:50,072
He must be on his way.

718
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:52,111
Come on.

719
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:41,569
The fairy wielded her magic
wand and the door opened.

720
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:45,510
You know what happened later?
The fairy took the prince.

721
00:53:46,028 --> 00:53:48,275
I don't want to hear this story!
I'm hungry.

722
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:50,975
Tina not again!
- Brother Arun..

723
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:05,405
Brother Arun I'm hungry.

724
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:09,950
Tina then the fairy
flew with the prince.

725
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:14,666
Went to the stars.
She hid behind the moon.

726
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:17,870
Then it started raining.

727
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:20,488
It rained heavily.

728
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:23,583
Then there was a loud noise.

729
00:54:23,703 --> 00:54:27,537
And she got scared.
So scared that...

730
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:11,376
Brother Arun we are not hungry.

731
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:16,451
We are just feeling sleepy.
- Really, we aren't hungry.

732
00:55:16,805 --> 00:55:19,226
Even I'm not hungry.

733
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,747
I promise you brother Arun,
we're not hungry.

734
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:00,801
I have failed today.

735
00:56:02,532 --> 00:56:06,469
I spent my entire childhood,
without my parents.

736
00:56:07,923 --> 00:56:10,810
Helpless, alone.

737
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,297
I brought you all...

738
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:19,234
one by one in this house...

739
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:23,764
so that you won't experience...

740
00:56:24,863 --> 00:56:26,514
the pain that I went through.

741
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:31,182
So that I could give you the joy,

742
00:56:31,651 --> 00:56:32,802
Which I didnt get.

743
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:36,064
But...

744
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:38,900
I couldn't do much.

745
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:42,195
I have failed.

746
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:44,976
I have failed today.

747
00:56:46,265 --> 00:56:47,146
I failed.

748
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,620
Calendar!

749
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,037
Calendar!

750
00:58:35,263 --> 00:58:38,784
Yes madam?
- Why is everyone quiet today?

751
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:42,707
What happened?
Why are the kids so quiet?

752
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:46,709
They haven't eaten since 2 days.
What noise will they make?

753
00:59:34,514 --> 00:59:35,806
Good morning.

754
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,303
Good morning.

755
00:59:44,925 --> 00:59:48,507
You've a holiday on Sunday.
I too have a holiday.

756
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,156
Why not give our war a break?

757
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:56,504
I thought we'd have a picnic here.

758
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:11,085
Let me tell you, you don't look
good when you're quiet.

759
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,848
You look nice when you make noise.

760
01:00:17,536 --> 01:00:20,581
Make noise later. First let's eat.

761
01:00:20,966 --> 01:00:23,692
I'm very hungry.

762
01:00:26,682 --> 01:00:29,086
What will you eat?

763
01:00:29,648 --> 01:00:31,003
Chips? Snacks?

764
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:35,627
Pastries?

765
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,976
Chocolates?

766
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,170
Tina, what will you have?
First of all.

767
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,218
Snacks?

768
01:00:58,003 --> 01:00:59,503
Here eat it.

769
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,086
Eat it.

770
01:01:10,777 --> 01:01:13,503
Let's make friends.

771
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:22,378
Tina will you be my friend?

772
01:01:29,305 --> 01:01:30,491
Yes.

773
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:50,627
Calendar,
serve everybody and me too.

774
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:54,266
I'm really terribly hungry!

775
01:01:55,497 --> 01:01:56,479
Really?

776
01:01:57,596 --> 01:01:58,575
Madam!

777
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:02,003
I gave you 3 months'advance.

778
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,923
But I love this place.

779
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:09,122
The balcony and the garden.
And the sea beyond.

780
01:02:10,825 --> 01:02:13,268
So if you want,
you can take 6 months'advance.

781
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:16,565
And if again the football hits
my face...

782
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:19,450
then you will never get it back,
Understand?

783
01:02:27,705 --> 01:02:30,124
Daga and teja...

784
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:34,757
The future Knights
of my future empire.

785
01:02:36,098 --> 01:02:38,342
Are such fools
and good-for-nothing,

786
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:41,627
that you cannot even find a place
on the seacoast of Mumbai

787
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:44,071
from where I can smuggle
all my weapons into India

788
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:45,732
But Mr.
Mogambo, the thing is that...

789
01:02:45,852 --> 01:02:48,292
Mogambo doens't want to hear
any clarifications...

790
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:53,924
but just wants to see his victory,
his rule and his monarchy.

791
01:02:54,044 --> 01:02:56,727
Mogambo's intentions are even
higher than the sky.

792
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:58,421
And you.

793
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:02,439
The place that you wanted on the
seacost of Mumbai, will be arranged.

794
01:03:03,582 --> 01:03:05,521
Mogambo... is pleased.

795
01:03:05,641 --> 01:03:08,964
Hey... hey... ohh... you crushed my
head.

796
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,865
Wait you little girl,
now i won't spare you.

797
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:22,938
Who are you? What do you want?

798
01:03:23,105 --> 01:03:24,146
Calendar!

799
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:27,525
Leave the kids alone!

800
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,777
Leave me I said,
What do you want man?

801
01:03:33,634 --> 01:03:35,610
You scoundrel, let me go.

802
01:03:37,424 --> 01:03:40,456
Let me go! Who are you?

803
01:03:40,855 --> 01:03:42,307
Brother!
- Calendar!

804
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:46,024
Let me go!

805
01:03:52,446 --> 01:03:54,351
Leave my children alone!

806
01:03:56,954 --> 01:03:59,912
Please don't beat brother Arun!

807
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:11,611
Brother!

808
01:04:21,854 --> 01:04:24,043
Leave my children alone!

809
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:28,869
Now you're really doomed!

810
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:31,413
My children!

811
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:39,266
Greetings Mr. Daga and Mr. Teja.

812
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:40,857
Welcome.
- Come in.

813
01:04:43,438 --> 01:04:44,572
Is he the man?

814
01:04:46,246 --> 01:04:48,727
Whatever your name be, listen.

815
01:04:49,676 --> 01:04:50,994
Vacate this house within 2 days.

816
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:52,989
Sir, it's best
he leaves this place.

817
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:58,187
Tells the world our
grains contains pebbles.

818
01:04:58,307 --> 01:04:59,370
Really?

819
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:06,219
All these businesses
and men are ours.

820
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:09,742
Wherever you go,
if you utter a word against them,

821
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:12,233
I'll be very severe on you.
Understood?

822
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:13,780
Let's go Mr. Teja.

823
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:20,648
Two days.

824
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,262
Get up brother Arun please.

825
01:05:30,382 --> 01:05:35,396
Get up brother Arun please.

826
01:05:38,113 --> 01:05:44,382
Get up brother Arun please.

827
01:05:49,351 --> 01:05:51,619
Uncle, they are very
dangerous people.

828
01:05:51,745 --> 01:05:55,148
Yes I do felt that Arun
is worried since some days.

829
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,505
But I didn't know such type
of scoundrels would be after him.

830
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:02,436
You did a good thing informing me.

831
01:06:02,647 --> 01:06:06,153
Just ask Arun to meet me,
May be I can be of help to him.

832
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:09,434
Now son you go home,
I have to go somewhere.

833
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:13,118
Go safely son... go.

834
01:06:29,273 --> 01:06:31,098
Sinha! Driver stop!

835
01:06:31,576 --> 01:06:34,189
That's professor Sinha!
Reverse the car!

836
01:06:35,064 --> 01:06:37,254
Take it back! C'mon!

837
01:06:37,772 --> 01:06:39,898
Take it back! C'mon!

838
01:06:41,356 --> 01:06:42,420
Sinha!

839
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,784
He's Sinha! Catch him!
He shouldn't escape.

840
01:06:44,904 --> 01:06:46,814
Get him! Get out!

841
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:49,748
C'mon get him!

842
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,302
Catch him!

843
01:06:55,564 --> 01:06:56,633
Sir, can I make a call?

844
01:06:56,753 --> 01:06:59,037
Yes but where?
- In the Press.

845
01:06:59,344 --> 01:07:01,830
Oh I mean to say from
where will you do it.

846
01:07:01,966 --> 01:07:02,921
Where is the phone?

847
01:07:03,425 --> 01:07:05,002
This... Its here.

848
01:07:05,265 --> 01:07:07,508
This is not a phone,
This is a radio Seema.

849
01:07:08,243 --> 01:07:09,536
Either wrong numbers ring up,

850
01:07:09,656 --> 01:07:12,764
or when you dial up, then other
ongoing calls can be heard.

851
01:07:12,884 --> 01:07:15,067
A unique program keeps airing on it
all the time. - What program?

852
01:07:15,222 --> 01:07:18,887
Sometimes two women gossip about
their mother in laws.

853
01:07:19,142 --> 01:07:22,148
Or sometimes two traders have
a discussion on various spices.

854
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:27,352
Or sometimes out of love two crazy
one's talk about their crazy love.

855
01:07:27,996 --> 01:07:29,632
Mr. Malhotra don't talk.

856
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,582
Hello!
- Yes Mr. Daga.

857
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:39,443
What do you want? Gold?

858
01:07:39,652 --> 01:07:40,547
Silver?

859
01:07:40,667 --> 01:07:41,996
Guns? Rifles?

860
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,723
Bombs? Hand grenades?

861
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:47,111
Thank you Mr. Walcott.
Come over this evening.

862
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:51,168
We'll discuss this
and entertain you.

863
01:07:51,705 --> 01:07:55,770
How? - You must know the famous
dancer, Hawahawai, from Havana?

864
01:07:56,336 --> 01:07:59,441
She'll entertain you this evening.

865
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,534
Ms. Hawahawai! I've heard of her.

866
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:03,636
So have I.

867
01:08:04,062 --> 01:08:06,229
So come over. We'll see her too.

868
01:08:06,354 --> 01:08:09,812
But where do I come?
- Powai lake, cottage no 24.

869
01:08:10,027 --> 01:08:11,734
Cottage no 24, right.

870
01:08:13,104 --> 01:08:15,039
Ms. Hawahawai!

871
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:19,540
Brother Arun, good I met you here.

872
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:21,617
There's a letter for you.

873
01:08:23,075 --> 01:08:24,575
Letter from Mr. Sinha?

874
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,825
'Arun, I'm going faraway.'

875
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:34,516
'But before I leave I want to tell
you the secret I never did.'

876
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:14,992
Looks like there's no electricity.

877
01:10:23,334 --> 01:10:27,505
'Whoever wears this gadget
and switches it on,'

878
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,542
'he will become invisible.'

879
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:36,792
'In this case, a person can only be
seen in red light or red goggles.'

880
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:40,042
'This gadget has no effect
on red colour.'

881
01:10:40,209 --> 01:10:41,876
'Otherwise in any coloured clothes'

882
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:45,834
'or any other coloured light, the
moment you switch the gadget on,'

883
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:48,667
'the person will be
completely invisible'

884
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:51,709
'and no eye will
be able to see him.'

885
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:25,048
Jugal, what do you say?
What do we do with this?

886
01:11:25,763 --> 01:11:28,629
Sinha's words turned true.

887
01:11:30,027 --> 01:11:31,167
Should I wear it?

888
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:34,037
Yes.

889
01:11:39,861 --> 01:11:42,879
Shall I switch it on?
- Yes.

890
01:11:50,419 --> 01:11:52,790
Brother Arun the light.

891
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:55,856
Brother Arun!

892
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,010
Where are you?

893
01:11:59,373 --> 01:12:00,902
I'm here Jugal.

894
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:04,902
I can't see you.

895
01:12:05,218 --> 01:12:08,015
Can't I be seen?
- No.

896
01:12:08,278 --> 01:12:09,986
Not at all?
- No.

897
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:14,162
I can't believe
that I'm really invisible!

898
01:12:16,342 --> 01:12:21,112
Jugal! I can't be seen
even in a mirror!

899
01:12:21,763 --> 01:12:23,329
Come look!

900
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:29,381
Even I know that.
But how will you come back?

901
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:31,704
Shall I press the button again?

902
01:12:33,997 --> 01:12:36,702
Brother Arun you've come back!

903
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:39,543
I've come back!

904
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:44,335
Then I couldn't see you.
Now I can!

905
01:12:44,524 --> 01:12:46,487
This is amazing!
- Amazing, isn't it?

906
01:12:46,985 --> 01:12:48,991
Yes.
- Shall I vanish again?

907
01:12:49,249 --> 01:12:51,798
Yes. No!
Brother Arun please come back!

908
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:54,920
I'm scared.
Brother Arun please come back!

909
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,610
You are my sweet brother, please.

910
01:12:58,934 --> 01:13:00,992
I can be seen!

911
01:13:01,112 --> 01:13:02,945
Look, I can be seen!

912
01:13:03,065 --> 01:13:05,368
Should I vanish again?
- Yes!

913
01:13:10,788 --> 01:13:14,724
Come back my nice brother!

914
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:19,193
Yes!
- Jugal! What's happening?

915
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:22,760
I'll go crazy!

916
01:13:24,706 --> 01:13:27,052
Come back.

917
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:28,841
Once more.

918
01:13:29,847 --> 01:13:31,598
Come.

919
01:13:38,153 --> 01:13:41,040
Isn't that amazing.

920
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,599
Brother Arun,
don't do this! I'll fall!

921
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,532
Please!
Put me down! I'll fall!

922
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:55,409
I won't talk to
you if you do this!

923
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:57,532
Then I'll vanish forever!

924
01:13:58,818 --> 01:14:00,304
Jugal look behind you.
- Yes.

925
01:14:00,499 --> 01:14:04,730
There are some red glass pieces
lying there. Get some here.

926
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,451
Look at me through it.

927
01:14:09,604 --> 01:14:12,983
I can see you through
the red glass!

928
01:14:14,052 --> 01:14:16,414
And now?
- Now I can't see you.

929
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:19,622
Can you see me?
- Yes.

930
01:14:23,246 --> 01:14:25,776
Beware of the red colour.

931
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:28,409
I'll stay away from red.

932
01:14:28,863 --> 01:14:34,300
But wherever Daga and Teja are,
they can't escape from me!

933
01:14:34,561 --> 01:14:36,182
Good
- Very good.

934
01:14:36,361 --> 01:14:39,572
Ah Ms. Hawa hawaiii,
Please come in.

935
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:43,191
Hello... You

936
01:14:43,425 --> 01:14:44,334
You Mr. Dhaaga?

937
01:14:44,454 --> 01:14:47,050
Not Dhaaga, Daaga.

938
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:49,582
Dhaaga... Ouiuiuiui.

939
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,659
This is Mr. Teja.

940
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,243
Pager... Funny name.

941
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,920
Teja... Pager?

942
01:14:55,132 --> 01:14:56,293
Teja... Pager right?

943
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:59,467
Ms. Hawahawai one of our esteemed
guests Mr. Wolcott is here. - Yes.

944
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,172
Wallclock?
- You have to entertain him.

945
01:15:01,292 --> 01:15:02,870
Oh really... I don't mind.

946
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:05,335
But for changing costume,
i need one loo.

947
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:08,155
Ya room... room?
- Room

948
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:10,670
Ya... ouiuiuiui.

949
01:15:10,818 --> 01:15:13,203
Gyan Singh. Just take madam to her
dressing room.

950
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:15,223
Thank you Mr. Pager.

951
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:18,375
Pager.
- Have a banana... Pager right!

952
01:15:21,106 --> 01:15:24,933
Daaga Sir.
Why did she call me Pager?

953
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:30,035
Madam this is your room.

954
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:31,603
Wow.
- Thank you!

955
01:15:36,014 --> 01:15:36,960
Thank you!

956
01:15:40,737 --> 01:15:42,153
Don't worry Mr. Daga,

957
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:45,996
I'll give you as much gold
as you want. - Good.

958
01:15:46,304 --> 01:15:49,617
And I can also
give you guns and drugs.

959
01:15:49,737 --> 01:15:53,952
Fine Mr. Wolcott, we'll take the
gold, drugs, as well as the guns.

960
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:56,906
But first I want one thing.
- What?

961
01:15:58,278 --> 01:15:59,445
A golden Hanuman.

962
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:02,272
Let me see.
- Recognise it?

963
01:16:02,496 --> 01:16:03,983
This statue?

964
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:06,737
It's in the big temple in the city.

965
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,276
It has a high value in our country.

966
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:13,532
Mr. Wolcott we will get it for you.

967
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:15,576
First, let us start the business.

968
01:16:16,344 --> 01:16:17,928
Where is Mr. Daga. Mr. Daga!

969
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,783

"Hawahawaiii ouiuiuiuiui."

971

972
01:17:44,579 --> 01:17:49,201
"I'm the princess of dreams,
I've charmed every heart."

973
01:17:49,325 --> 01:17:54,081
"My tresses, the clouds.
My squirms, lightning."

974
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:58,526
"I'm here to cast my spell."

975
01:17:58,711 --> 01:18:03,434
"I'm here to cast my spell."

976
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:07,040
"They call me Hawahawai."

977
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,331
"Hawahawai!
- Hawahawai!"

978
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:10,360
"Hawahawai!"

979
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,127

Where is she going? What's wrong?

01:21:30,436 --> 01:21:34,567
"I bring colourful stories."

987
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:39,071
"You too hear, madman."

988
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:44,396
"Let me make your heart restless.
Let me drive you crazy."

989
01:21:44,516 --> 01:21:49,105
"In my eyes, magic.
In my breath, fragrance."

990
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:53,438
"When I sway my body,
everybody is floored."

991
01:21:53,558 --> 01:21:58,479
"Everybody is floored."

992
01:21:58,599 --> 01:22:02,564
"My face, unparalleled."

993
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:07,896
"My face, unparalleled."

994
01:22:08,016 --> 01:22:12,521
"They call me Hawahawai."
- "Hawahawai!"

995
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:14,938
"Hawahawai!"
- "Hawahawai!"

996
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:18,850
"Hawahawai!"

997
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:23,821
"I'm here to cast a spell."

998
01:22:24,256 --> 01:22:28,820
"I'm here to cast my spell."

999
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:32,218
"They call me Hawahawai."

1000
01:22:32,338 --> 01:22:33,456
"Hawahawai!"

1001
01:22:33,576 --> 01:22:35,646
"Hawahawai.
- Hawahawai!"

1002
01:22:35,766 --> 01:22:38,891
"Hawahawai!"

1003
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:41,599
"Hawahawai!"

1004
01:22:42,309 --> 01:22:44,016
"Hawahawai!"

1005
01:22:44,613 --> 01:22:46,348
"Hawahawai!"

1006
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:48,641
"Hawahawai!"

1007
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:28,003
Who are you?

1008
01:23:30,336 --> 01:23:31,252
Who are you?

1009
01:23:33,711 --> 01:23:36,121
She can be anyone.

1010
01:23:37,297 --> 01:23:40,432
Police informer, CID agent.

1011
01:23:41,411 --> 01:23:43,544
Or a spy of our enemy!

1012
01:23:44,674 --> 01:23:48,602
Whoever she is, she'll tell us.

1013
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:54,960
Jhonny... go to my room.

1014
01:23:55,566 --> 01:23:59,434
You will find
a soft leather hunter kept there.

1015
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:00,856
Get it.

1016
01:24:23,829 --> 01:24:25,815
Did you hear the sound?

1017
01:24:26,413 --> 01:24:28,495
Now this whip
will hear your screams!

1018
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,954
What did you come
here to find out?

1019
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:34,787
Whatever you came here for,
I'll tell you myself!

1020
01:24:37,381 --> 01:24:39,912
We're involved in smuggling,
black marketing, adulteration,

1021
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:44,079
gambling, drugs, liquor or
anything you can think of.

1022
01:24:45,168 --> 01:24:50,787
Before you die, you will tell us
who sent you here?

1023
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:58,495
I got it. Now this whip
will loosen your tongue.

1024
01:25:26,964 --> 01:25:28,341
I fainted!

1025
01:25:28,895 --> 01:25:30,038
Move!

1026
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:38,542
Doesn't matter.
I'll deal with Miss Hawahawai!

1027
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:11,793
Mr. Daga what's going on?

1028
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:22,499
Mr. Daga grab it stealthily.

1029
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:25,736
What?
- Grab it stealthily!

1030
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:38,989
Mr. Teja did you see that?

1031
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:42,917
His is my whip! My own!

1032
01:26:48,814 --> 01:26:50,024
Who slapped me?

1033
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:57,413
Who is slapping me?

1034
01:26:58,596 --> 01:27:00,113
Who is slapping me?

1035
01:27:00,293 --> 01:27:04,296
So Mr. Teja.
What did the girl reveal?

1036
01:27:05,073 --> 01:27:06,114
Who is she?

1037
01:27:06,683 --> 01:27:07,879
What is the matter?

1038
01:27:11,335 --> 01:27:14,614
Mr. Daga what are you doing?

1039
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,065
What happened?

1040
01:27:17,252 --> 01:27:19,198
Who is slapping me?

1041
01:27:19,425 --> 01:27:22,642
What nonsense?
You've had a drink too many.

1042
01:27:22,895 --> 01:27:24,655
No.
- Who will slap you?

1043
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:27,860
There is nobody here.
- Somebody.

1044
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:31,586
Mr. Teja it's all
because of liquor.

1045
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,877
Because of liquor.

1046
01:27:36,368 --> 01:27:37,649
Girl!

1047
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:40,371
Cheers!

1048
01:27:48,274 --> 01:27:51,209
Beware!
- What happened to you?

1049
01:27:51,329 --> 01:27:53,707
Beware!

1050
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,114
I will kill you.

1051
01:28:00,783 --> 01:28:02,236
The situation is under control!

1052
01:28:02,356 --> 01:28:04,433
Everything is under control!

1053
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,751
I'm here!

1054
01:28:11,299 --> 01:28:12,704
Mr. Daga!

1055
01:28:12,865 --> 01:28:14,185
Mr. Daga!
- I'm here.

1056
01:28:14,393 --> 01:28:16,214
Somebody slapped me!
- You too?

1057
01:28:17,221 --> 01:28:18,303
Mr. Daga...

1058
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,912
Why don't I shoot both of you?

1059
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:40,283
Who are you? What are you?
- Where are you?

1060
01:28:40,403 --> 01:28:44,259
I'm no ghost or shadow or spirit.

1061
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:48,026
I'm a victim of the atrocities
of men like you.

1062
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:50,082
An ordinary Indian.

1063
01:28:50,771 --> 01:28:52,970
My name is Mr. India.

1064
01:28:53,718 --> 01:28:54,661
Mr. India!

1065
01:28:55,203 --> 01:28:57,460
Oh my god!
This is front page news!

1066
01:28:58,106 --> 01:29:02,494
Mr. India, why are you invisible
if you are an ordinary Indian?

1067
01:29:02,943 --> 01:29:06,323
Because your eyes
are filled with greed!

1068
01:29:06,602 --> 01:29:09,494
Until today you never
saw an ordinary Indian.

1069
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:11,246
How can you see him today?

1070
01:29:11,507 --> 01:29:15,371
What do you want, Mr. India?
- To explain to you.

1071
01:29:15,755 --> 01:29:19,204
If you try to throw
those children out of their house.

1072
01:29:19,597 --> 01:29:21,595
I'll remove you from this world!
- Excuse me!

1073
01:29:21,715 --> 01:29:24,703
Excuse me, Mr. India.
I want to ask some questions.

1074
01:29:24,823 --> 01:29:26,161
Pen!

1075
01:29:26,766 --> 01:29:27,815
One minute!

1076
01:29:27,935 --> 01:29:29,400
Excuse me, thank you.

1077
01:29:30,293 --> 01:29:32,704
Mr. India you...
- I'm here.

1078
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:35,447
Were you invisible
since childhood?

1079
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:39,377
Since when are you in this
not to be seen profession?

1080
01:29:39,837 --> 01:29:40,869
You know what I mean?

1081
01:29:41,056 --> 01:29:42,657
Do you want to give a message
for our readers?

1082
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:46,413
Ms. Hawahawai,
you forget where you are. - Where?

1083
01:29:46,702 --> 01:29:48,246
Oh my god you are right!

1084
01:29:48,422 --> 01:29:50,669
Mr. India these men...
- Don't be afraid.

1085
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:53,287
I'll drop you home.
- Thanks a lot.

1086
01:29:53,606 --> 01:29:57,321
Daga and Teja! This is my first
and last warning to you!

1087
01:29:57,441 --> 01:29:59,251
I'll never venture
near that house!

1088
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:02,620
It's not just a matter of the house
but of the whole nation.

1089
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:06,413
You were heating the market
of dishonesty and atrocities.

1090
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:10,537
But now your atrocities and sins
have gone over the top!

1091
01:30:10,866 --> 01:30:13,419
You'll pay for every crime!

1092
01:30:13,881 --> 01:30:16,461
This is not a threat
but my promise!

1093
01:30:16,724 --> 01:30:18,569
Let's go madam.
This is enough for today.

1094
01:30:18,689 --> 01:30:19,683
Ok.

1095
01:30:46,615 --> 01:30:48,728
Mr. India?

1096
01:30:50,687 --> 01:30:54,245
Mr. India?

1097
01:30:57,164 --> 01:31:01,984
Mr. India?

1098
01:31:05,265 --> 01:31:08,480
Why are you worried?

1099
01:31:09,492 --> 01:31:11,870
This is great news!

1100
01:31:12,593 --> 01:31:14,823
Because if there is a Mr. India.

1101
01:31:15,353 --> 01:31:21,089
It means the formula
which I was looking for,

1102
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:26,476
will sooner or later
be in Mogambo's hands!

1103
01:31:27,822 --> 01:31:30,678
Mr. India.
- Mr. India?

1104
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,450
Is he a body builder?

1105
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:38,363
Sir you don't understand.
He is an amazing man.

1106
01:31:38,634 --> 01:31:40,467
He can't be seen.

1107
01:31:40,734 --> 01:31:42,634
Can't be seen?
- Yes.

1108
01:31:43,092 --> 01:31:44,592
Where does he vanish?

1109
01:31:45,217 --> 01:31:48,037
Even Malhotra is not to be seen.
Doesn't he want his job?

1110
01:31:50,467 --> 01:31:52,932
Hello. Yes! Fire brigade? No sir.

1111
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:57,766
Sir, this Mr. India is invisible.

1112
01:31:58,384 --> 01:32:00,942
He'll be in front of you
but you won't be able to see him.

1113
01:32:01,259 --> 01:32:03,262
But you'll hear his voice.

1114
01:32:04,134 --> 01:32:08,431
He picks up a thing, you'll see it
being picked but you won't see him.

1115
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:10,842
I've seen him with my own eyes.

1116
01:32:11,034 --> 01:32:13,445
I mean I haven't seen him.

1117
01:32:13,998 --> 01:32:16,507
But I've seen him.

1118
01:32:17,261 --> 01:32:20,195
Sir, I hope you understand.
Invisible!

1119
01:32:23,087 --> 01:32:26,509
Seema, you haven't gone
on leave since a while.

1120
01:32:27,011 --> 01:32:29,043
You need the rest very badly.

1121
01:32:29,634 --> 01:32:32,722
No problem, go and take rest.
- You think I'm wrong?

1122
01:32:32,842 --> 01:32:34,200
There'll be chaos,

1123
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,759
when his interview
is printed on the front page!

1124
01:32:36,883 --> 01:32:37,932
What?

1125
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:38,972
In my newspaper?
- Yes.

1126
01:32:39,092 --> 01:32:40,194
Front page?
- Mr. India.

1127
01:32:40,314 --> 01:32:42,987
An interview with Mr. India
who can't be seen?

1128
01:32:43,259 --> 01:32:45,569
You weren't here
so I gave it to the press.

1129
01:32:45,689 --> 01:32:46,514
Oh god!

1130
01:32:46,634 --> 01:32:49,763
You'll close down my business with
your trash! - What do you mean?

1131
01:32:49,883 --> 01:32:52,307
My writing is trash?
- Of course it is!

1132
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:54,306
You are fired.

1133
01:32:54,426 --> 01:32:56,389
Sir...
- You are fired!

1134
01:32:56,509 --> 01:32:57,521
You're not going to believe me!

1135
01:32:57,641 --> 01:33:02,889
Just like he can't be seen, you
become Miss India and just vanish.

1136
01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:04,718
Out! Go away!

1137
01:33:04,925 --> 01:33:06,736
All right I'm leaving!

1138
01:33:06,856 --> 01:33:08,050
Sorry madam.

1139
01:33:10,227 --> 01:33:11,712
Malhotra...
- Yes Sir.

1140
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:14,343
Follow this lady and whatever
she said,

1141
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:16,662
just stop that from getting printed
in the paper... Go. - Ok Sir.

1142
01:33:18,059 --> 01:33:20,538
Hello... What... Yes.

1143
01:33:21,731 --> 01:33:23,952
Yes... you dialled
the right number.

1144
01:33:24,837 --> 01:33:26,700
Yes is hospital?

1145
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:31,515
Now pls send all the crazy ones in
your family.

1146
01:33:31,635 --> 01:33:34,196
I will make all of them a Crime
Reporter for sure.

1147
01:33:34,316 --> 01:33:35,902
My editor says I'm crazy!

1148
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:39,636
But those who don't
believe me are crazy!

1149
01:33:39,756 --> 01:33:44,251
I'm telling all of you
there is a Mr. India!

1150
01:33:44,448 --> 01:33:46,758
There is a Mr. India!

1151
01:33:46,905 --> 01:33:50,078
Yes he exists!
- But why have you brought us here?

1152
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,369
Because Mr. India is going
to come here very shortly.

1153
01:33:53,489 --> 01:33:57,427
He'll come here?
- Yes right here!

1154
01:33:58,507 --> 01:34:02,676
Nobody is ready to believe me.
I even told Arun!

1155
01:34:02,796 --> 01:34:05,169
To come here.
But he didn't want to come.

1156
01:34:05,628 --> 01:34:08,615
There is a Mr. India!

1157
01:34:08,735 --> 01:34:11,370
He won't understand
what Mr. India is.

1158
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:14,097
You tell me what he is.

1159
01:34:14,355 --> 01:34:17,423
He is a friend of the weak.
Enemy of the evil.

1160
01:34:17,691 --> 01:34:20,014
He says in this world...

1161
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:22,010
But why are you asking?

1162
01:34:22,347 --> 01:34:24,474
You don't believe that
Mr. India exists.

1163
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:27,306
You didn't want to come here.
Why did you come?

1164
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:31,805
I thought Mr. India won't be
coming here, so I might as well.

1165
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:34,556
I wasn't even talking to you.

1166
01:34:34,681 --> 01:34:36,520
You interfered and now you...

1167
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,443
This is strange!

1168
01:34:37,563 --> 01:34:40,984
If we don't want to talk about
Mr. India, you feel bad.

1169
01:34:41,104 --> 01:34:42,847
And if we do, you feel bad!

1170
01:34:43,132 --> 01:34:45,181
Jugal, what does any one do?

1171
01:34:46,095 --> 01:34:49,014
Do whatever you want
but leave me alone.

1172
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:50,835
That's enough! My god!

1173
01:34:51,139 --> 01:34:53,596
Brother Arun she's leaving!

1174
01:34:53,716 --> 01:34:56,037
She is furious! You wait here.

1175
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,640
Madam! Wait! Listen!

1176
01:34:57,812 --> 01:34:59,564
Please!

1177
01:35:00,052 --> 01:35:02,566
You're unnecessarily getting angry.
I'm your well wisher.

1178
01:35:02,753 --> 01:35:04,815
Take my advice
and forget Mr. India.

1179
01:35:04,935 --> 01:35:06,929
How can you trust
a man who can't be seen?

1180
01:35:07,049 --> 01:35:08,473
I completely trust him.

1181
01:35:08,675 --> 01:35:11,847
In just a couple of days, Mr. India
has became so important to you?

1182
01:35:12,108 --> 01:35:13,573
He has brain washed you!

1183
01:35:13,693 --> 01:35:15,887
If I meet him,
I'll teach him a lesson!

1184
01:35:17,454 --> 01:35:18,756
So this is it.
- What?

1185
01:35:18,876 --> 01:35:21,017
Now I know why you hate him.

1186
01:35:21,137 --> 01:35:22,523
Why will I hate him?
- You envy him!

1187
01:35:22,706 --> 01:35:25,017
Why should I?
- Because you..

1188
01:35:25,228 --> 01:35:26,937
You know why.
- I know?

1189
01:35:27,453 --> 01:35:28,889
What do I know?

1190
01:36:10,674 --> 01:36:15,846
"I'm in love with Mr. India."

1191
01:36:15,966 --> 01:36:20,836
"I wish to meet him
a hundred times."

1192
01:36:21,132 --> 01:36:26,138
"I'm in love with Mr. India."

1193
01:36:26,258 --> 01:36:31,138
"I wish to meet
him a hundred times."

1194
01:36:31,258 --> 01:36:33,799
"Will you meet someone
who can't be seen?"

1195
01:36:33,924 --> 01:36:36,345
"The poor thing can only be heard."

1196
01:36:36,465 --> 01:36:41,296
"What's the big deal
about such a Mr. India?"

1197
01:36:41,507 --> 01:36:46,387
"I'm in love with Mr. India."

1198
01:36:46,507 --> 01:36:51,470
"I wish to meet
him a hundred times."

1199
01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:56,595
"I'm in love with Mr. India."

1200
01:36:56,715 --> 01:37:02,097
"I wish to meet
him a hundred times."

1201
01:38:45,395 --> 01:38:48,539
"He's the prince of my dreams."

1202
01:38:50,477 --> 01:38:53,807
"Silly! It's time you
came to your senses."

1203
01:38:55,416 --> 01:39:00,396
"He's so brave!
- Someday he'll bite the dust."

1204
01:39:00,516 --> 01:39:05,624
"He's beyond compare!
- Don't put him on a pedestal."

1205
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:10,701
"He's no ordinary man,
someday I'll show you."

1206
01:39:10,821 --> 01:39:18,038
"Someday you'll find
out his greatness."

1207
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:22,943
"No use meeting Mr. India."

1208
01:39:23,063 --> 01:39:27,989
"Stop meeting Mr. India."

1209
01:39:28,109 --> 01:39:32,646
"No use meeting Mr. India."

1210
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:37,562
"Stop meeting Mr. India."

1211
01:39:37,682 --> 01:39:42,545
"I'm in love with Mr. India."

1212
01:39:42,665 --> 01:39:47,419
"I'll meet him a hundred times."

1213
01:39:47,663 --> 01:39:52,384
"I'm in love with Mr. India."

1214
01:39:52,648 --> 01:39:57,587
"I'll meet him a hundred times."

1215
01:39:58,264 --> 01:39:59,904
Someone is drowning!

1216
01:40:03,022 --> 01:40:06,592
Could it be Mr. India?
- Shut up! He can't be seen!

1217
01:40:07,463 --> 01:40:10,899
Somebody help him!
- C'mon hurry up!

1218
01:40:11,569 --> 01:40:13,307
Arun brother!
- Tina!

1219
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:17,533
Put him here. Poor guy is alive.

1220
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,442
This is Mr. Baburam.

1221
01:40:21,406 --> 01:40:27,151
I know suicide is cowardice.

1222
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:30,973
But I had no other option.

1223
01:40:32,535 --> 01:40:34,681
My daughter's marriage
had been fixed.

1224
01:40:35,502 --> 01:40:38,009
The groom's family
was to come in just 4 days.

1225
01:40:39,263 --> 01:40:44,376
I scratched and scrimped
to save money.

1226
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:46,633
No sir let me go!

1227
01:40:46,753 --> 01:40:50,509
This money is
for my daughter's wedding.

1228
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:53,341
Wants to get his daughter married,
scoundrel!

1229
01:40:53,461 --> 01:40:55,551
Let go!
- My money!

1230
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:58,753
For my daughter's marriage!

1231
01:40:59,254 --> 01:41:01,205
Your daughter,
Sarla is like our sister.

1232
01:41:01,368 --> 01:41:04,212
I'll arrange for something
by evening. Trust me.

1233
01:41:04,456 --> 01:41:08,426
You've said it but
what will you do by evening?

1234
01:41:09,650 --> 01:41:13,478
I'll have to think.
- Think! You keep thinking.

1235
01:41:14,437 --> 01:41:17,045
But I'm going to that rascals den!

1236
01:41:17,388 --> 01:41:21,087
If I don't get Baburam's money
back then shame on me!

1237
01:41:21,878 --> 01:41:24,753
Aunt, I'll take you to his den.

1238
01:41:25,527 --> 01:41:26,711
Ok, let's go.

1239
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:42,958
Good morning. Good afternoon.

1240
01:41:43,078 --> 01:41:43,916
Good evening!

1241
01:41:44,036 --> 01:41:47,821
Who are you?
- Who am I?

1242
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:50,679
Charlie!
- Charlie, who?

1243
01:41:51,112 --> 01:41:53,422
You don't know about
Charlie Chaplin? How funny!

1244
01:41:53,612 --> 01:41:54,916
Your name?
- Dabarcha.

1245
01:41:55,036 --> 01:41:56,057
Dabarcha.

1246
01:41:56,395 --> 01:41:58,254
Who are you?
- My name is Karga.

1247
01:41:58,613 --> 01:41:59,910
Ghurka (security guard)?
- Karga!

1248
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:00,863
Good name!

1249
01:42:01,988 --> 01:42:06,413
Come gentlemen, try your luck.
Put your money and take it all!

1250
01:42:06,533 --> 01:42:07,451
Hurry up, try your luck.

1251
01:42:07,571 --> 01:42:09,119
This is roulette!

1252
01:42:09,239 --> 01:42:11,464
No fights please.

1253
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:13,398
Brother please. Come one by one.

1254
01:42:13,643 --> 01:42:16,064
Sister Seema, he has an eye on us.

1255
01:42:17,947 --> 01:42:20,279
Gentlemen try your luck.

1256
01:42:23,446 --> 01:42:27,514
Now we'll have to play
to save our skin.

1257
01:42:30,215 --> 01:42:33,034
This.
- There, not here.

1258
01:42:34,556 --> 01:42:38,035
50 bucks on number 7.

1259
01:42:38,155 --> 01:42:40,538
Number 7, turn around.
- C'mon!

1260
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,778
The number is coming.

1261
01:42:45,546 --> 01:42:48,205
Number 3. Number 7!

1262
01:42:48,325 --> 01:42:50,527
Number 7.
- 7!

1263
01:42:51,512 --> 01:42:55,995
My lucky number. Money please!

1264
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:04,716
On number 5!

1265
01:43:04,836 --> 01:43:06,660
Number 5! Excuse me.

1266
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,410
Number 5!
- Number 5!

1267
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:10,688
We told you number 5!

1268
01:43:10,808 --> 01:43:15,077
Number 5! C'mon!

1269
01:43:15,197 --> 01:43:17,037
The number is coming.

1270
01:43:17,197 --> 01:43:20,827
The number... Number...

1271
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:24,011
Number 5!

1272
01:43:24,286 --> 01:43:26,955
Number 5!

1273
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:28,940
Number 5!

1274
01:43:30,018 --> 01:43:32,235
Number 5!

1275
01:43:33,613 --> 01:43:36,780
Excuse me!
I think 200 has become 2000.

1276
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,674
Thank you.

1277
01:43:42,476 --> 01:43:44,070
Sorry brother, you hit the wrong
number...

1278
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,221
Okay so now who is next?

1279
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:47,763
Anybody?
- Excuse me, these are two thousand

1280
01:43:47,883 --> 01:43:49,244
How much?
- On the Number 4.

1281
01:43:49,364 --> 01:43:50,482
Two thousand?
- Yes on the number 4.

1282
01:43:50,602 --> 01:43:51,683
On Number 4?

1283
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:58,174
Hey come on move,
- Get out of here.

1284
01:43:58,369 --> 01:44:00,028
Hey, what number did she bid on?
- Number 4.

1285
01:44:00,148 --> 01:44:01,237
Shut up.

1286
01:44:07,672 --> 01:44:11,130
Hey you bid on number 4,
you lost your money!

1287
01:44:14,002 --> 01:44:15,999
Twenty thousand out of two
thousand.

1288
01:44:16,119 --> 01:44:17,552
Money... Money... money please.
- Money Money.

1289
01:44:17,692 --> 01:44:19,350
Money... Money... Please.
- Money.

1290
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:20,830
Hey, Don't give her.

1291
01:44:21,104 --> 01:44:22,543
You have cheated.
- What are you saying?

1292
01:44:22,663 --> 01:44:25,214
What... Charlie and cheating.

1293
01:44:26,354 --> 01:44:28,358
What's going on dear?

1294
01:44:28,578 --> 01:44:32,235
Okay... Okay Mr. Gurkha...
I will hit this target again.

1295
01:44:32,517 --> 01:44:34,265
You just wait here... Okay.

1296
01:44:34,792 --> 01:44:36,200
Such a freak.

1297
01:44:36,838 --> 01:44:38,461
Take it... Come on hit it.

1298
01:44:38,665 --> 01:44:39,440
Number 4?
- Yes.

1299
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:41,317
Hit it... Hit it Boss.

1300
01:44:42,774 --> 01:44:43,923
Hey.
- What?

1301
01:44:44,043 --> 01:44:46,786
Not on number 4, you must hit on
Number 7 now.

1302
01:44:47,076 --> 01:44:50,016
Yes on the number 7... its my lucky
number 7. - Yes.

1303
01:45:19,531 --> 01:45:21,015
My Twenty Thousand.

1304
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:34,224
Nab these rascals!
Don't let them escape!

1305
01:45:34,344 --> 01:45:35,975
My god! Run!

1306
01:45:36,095 --> 01:45:38,843
My money!

1307
01:45:43,486 --> 01:45:45,197
Catch the ***!

1308
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:58,175
Thrash both of them.

1309
01:46:49,408 --> 01:46:52,012
Guys... Don't let her go.
She ruined everything.

1310
01:46:54,049 --> 01:46:55,368
Catch her.

1311
01:47:50,055 --> 01:47:53,681
Yahoo Mr. India!
Now put me down.

1312
01:47:54,971 --> 01:47:56,458
You...

1313
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:52,745
Hurry up!
- This way.

1314
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:55,002
Not that way.
This way, the bus has arrived!

1315
01:49:58,868 --> 01:50:00,050
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1316
01:50:01,425 --> 01:50:04,400
Take this Mr. Baburam.
All this money is yours.

1317
01:50:04,895 --> 01:50:07,036
Get your daughter married grandly.

1318
01:50:08,220 --> 01:50:12,196
How can I thank you?
- Thank Mr. India.

1319
01:50:12,402 --> 01:50:13,536
It's his doing.

1320
01:50:13,859 --> 01:50:17,667
It's your generosity.
She risked her life and gambled.

1321
01:50:17,787 --> 01:50:19,722
And gives the credit
to some Mr. India!

1322
01:50:19,842 --> 01:50:23,122
Is it necessary to say this?
- Not really, yet..

1323
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:26,765
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1324
01:50:27,214 --> 01:50:28,958
Goodbye!

1325
01:50:30,654 --> 01:50:31,536
Goodbye!

1326
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,404
Well done Seema!

1327
01:50:38,295 --> 01:50:42,405
Mr. India! - What you did
for Baburam's family,

1328
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:44,363
I liked it very much.

1329
01:50:44,694 --> 01:50:46,655
Thank you Mr. India!

1330
01:50:47,064 --> 01:50:49,691
But if you had not come
to Karga's den,

1331
01:50:50,019 --> 01:50:53,007
I'd be in serious problem.

1332
01:50:53,271 --> 01:50:56,244
You won't face any problems
while I'm around.

1333
01:50:56,682 --> 01:50:57,775
So sweet of you.

1334
01:50:57,949 --> 01:51:01,402
I've heard your editor
has fired you?

1335
01:51:02,018 --> 01:51:04,446
Editor? Don't mention him!

1336
01:51:04,803 --> 01:51:06,339
What does he think of himself?

1337
01:51:06,537 --> 01:51:09,137
Seema don't worry.
- Why not?

1338
01:51:09,292 --> 01:51:10,981
He thinks I'm crazy!

1339
01:51:11,262 --> 01:51:13,952
He's not willing to believe
that you actually exist.

1340
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:19,273
Tell him I'll meet him
tomorrow in his office at 5.00.

1341
01:51:20,665 --> 01:51:22,727
Promise?
- Promise.

1342
01:51:25,353 --> 01:51:28,525
Hello... Hello... No... No...
Sorry, wrong number.

1343
01:51:28,645 --> 01:51:30,640
No... this is not a hospital.
- Okay boss.

1344
01:51:31,951 --> 01:51:34,944
So you mean to say that the door
open at exact 5:30 pm.

1345
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:36,623
But there would be nobody... right?

1346
01:51:36,743 --> 01:51:39,727
But somebody... I mean
Mr. India will come in. - Right.

1347
01:51:40,017 --> 01:51:42,771
And the chair will move by itself,
he will sit.

1348
01:51:43,056 --> 01:51:46,695
And will call me, Hello
Mr. Gaitonde, how are you?

1349
01:51:46,886 --> 01:51:49,110
And I will say Hello Mr. India,
please have a cigar.

1350
01:51:49,230 --> 01:51:52,828
And all by itself the cigar will
go up in the air.

1351
01:51:53,062 --> 01:51:54,751
And he will smoke.

1352
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:55,911
It could be.

1353
01:51:56,049 --> 01:51:57,531
Yes it could be...
definitely it could be.

1354
01:51:57,651 --> 01:52:03,169
That you suddenly open your eyes
and you realise you were dreaming.

1355
01:52:07,668 --> 01:52:10,252
Hello Seema.

1356
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:12,624
Hello Mr. India!

1357
01:52:26,191 --> 01:52:29,339
Hello Mr. Gaitonde. How are you?

1358
01:52:29,842 --> 01:52:34,674
I'm fine. I'm actually fine sir.

1359
01:52:38,671 --> 01:52:39,664
Thank you.

1360
01:52:58,329 --> 01:53:01,457
Why do you seem so shocked?
- Nothing at all.

1361
01:53:01,672 --> 01:53:04,526
Actually, it's nothing.

1362
01:53:05,263 --> 01:53:07,583
The strange thing is,
I can't see him.

1363
01:53:07,848 --> 01:53:10,681
And he asks me why I'm shocked!

1364
01:53:14,382 --> 01:53:17,345
Cigar Mr. India.
- Thank you Seema.

1365
01:53:18,748 --> 01:53:21,291
Do you have a match or a lighter?

1366
01:53:21,531 --> 01:53:23,509
Yes I've a lighter.

1367
01:53:26,745 --> 01:53:28,656
Sorry! Very sorry sir.

1368
01:53:40,776 --> 01:53:42,507
Thank you.

1369
01:53:44,208 --> 01:53:45,720
Editor!

1370
01:53:46,894 --> 01:53:51,784
I've heard that
you've fired Seema Soni.

1371
01:53:52,223 --> 01:53:55,448
No! Who told you?

1372
01:53:55,699 --> 01:53:56,720
It's not possible.

1373
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:00,501
Please tell him. Our staff,

1374
01:54:00,711 --> 01:54:04,569
it's like a small family.

1375
01:54:04,823 --> 01:54:06,333
No injustice done here.

1376
01:54:06,658 --> 01:54:10,159
We live in harmony and love!

1377
01:54:10,824 --> 01:54:13,792
Why will I fire her?
It's her own newspaper.

1378
01:54:14,048 --> 01:54:17,196
Why should you ask me?
You may interview him and print it.

1379
01:54:17,316 --> 01:54:18,776
Strange!

1380
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:21,626
Actually I had not seen you.

1381
01:54:21,908 --> 01:54:25,924
Now that I've seen you.
Haven't seen you.

1382
01:54:26,068 --> 01:54:28,475
Then I knew you can't be seen.

1383
01:54:35,805 --> 01:54:37,189
Call for you.

1384
01:54:46,925 --> 01:54:49,717
Ok Mr. Gaitonde, I must leave.

1385
01:54:51,675 --> 01:54:53,353
Ok bye Seema.
- Bye Mr. India.

1386
01:54:53,473 --> 01:54:56,891
I will meet you tomorrow at 7 pm
at the same place. - Okay.

1387
01:55:02,714 --> 01:55:04,184
The phone is in your handsSir.

1388
01:55:04,304 --> 01:55:06,524
What.
- Phone Sir... in your hands.

1389
01:55:06,997 --> 01:55:08,603
Oh Yes.

1390
01:55:09,355 --> 01:55:13,449
Hello... Hello... Hello...

1391
01:55:16,567 --> 01:55:19,757
What's happening Seema,
this isn't working.

1392
01:55:20,329 --> 01:55:24,481
He is not visible.

1393
01:55:38,407 --> 01:55:39,711
No!

1394
01:55:44,148 --> 01:55:46,236
She is crying a lot.
- Don't take my baby away!

1395
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:49,618
She hasn't eaten anything
since morning. - Enough!

1396
01:55:49,738 --> 01:55:53,174
How much will you cry?
- No!

1397
01:55:53,385 --> 01:55:55,020
Laxmi enough!

1398
01:55:56,106 --> 01:55:59,100
What harm had my baby done?

1399
01:56:11,741 --> 01:56:14,750
The poor woman has gone mad
because of her son's death.

1400
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:18,600
I saw him this morning,
playing in the lane.

1401
01:56:18,825 --> 01:56:22,338
What happened suddenly?
- He came home ate lunch

1402
01:56:22,458 --> 01:56:24,016
and died within 15 minutes.

1403
01:56:24,274 --> 01:56:25,940
This is a common scene.

1404
01:56:26,263 --> 01:56:30,396
Countless people are dying everyday
because of adulterated food.

1405
01:56:31,598 --> 01:56:33,947
Let me go! Let go!

1406
01:56:34,273 --> 01:56:37,258
It's in the newspapers.
It's happening everywhere.

1407
01:56:37,378 --> 01:56:41,490
What kind of people
indulge in adulteration?

1408
01:56:41,886 --> 01:56:45,394
Whoever they are. Let me tell you.

1409
01:56:46,351 --> 01:56:48,446
They will pay for their crimes!

1410
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:55,765
Move!
- Sir my kids are starving!

1411
01:56:55,885 --> 01:56:58,939
They haven't eaten since days!

1412
01:56:59,059 --> 01:57:01,014
Sir please!

1413
01:57:10,343 --> 01:57:13,713
Anything else sir?
- Ask madam.

1414
01:57:13,987 --> 01:57:20,479
Neelam darling, anything else?
- You know that I'm on a diet.

1415
01:57:21,895 --> 01:57:25,276
You know how little I eat.
Isn't it?

1416
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:30,540
People tell me,
there's shortage of food in India.

1417
01:57:31,398 --> 01:57:33,625
Tell them to come
and look at this table.

1418
01:57:33,745 --> 01:57:34,767
Where's the shortage?

1419
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:38,225
Fantastic food!
Mr. Teja it's wonderful!

1420
01:57:38,459 --> 01:57:40,561
Have some soup please!

1421
01:57:40,748 --> 01:57:44,605
I'll drink poison
if you want me to.

1422
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:47,631
How sweet!

1423
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:50,951
What are you doing?

1424
01:57:51,452 --> 01:57:52,993
I'm so sorry Mr. Teja!

1425
01:57:53,410 --> 01:57:55,494
It's all right.

1426
01:57:55,743 --> 01:57:59,243
I don't know, my hand...
This spoon! In your ear?

1427
01:57:59,684 --> 01:58:02,202
Darling I don't eat with my ear.
Never!

1428
01:58:02,327 --> 01:58:03,852
I'm sorry.

1429
01:58:03,993 --> 01:58:07,035
But now I must feed my Teju.

1430
01:58:07,910 --> 01:58:10,442
Take this.

1431
01:58:11,826 --> 01:58:15,026
What's going on? I'll go mad!

1432
01:58:15,285 --> 01:58:17,542
Can I help you sir?

1433
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,773
No, we were just talking.
You may go.

1434
01:58:23,575 --> 01:58:24,590
Neelam!
- Yes.

1435
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:26,160
Are you all right?

1436
01:58:27,024 --> 01:58:31,240
Believe me, on both occasions
I felt someone holding my hand.

1437
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:33,870
Oh god!

1438
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:36,281
Got it! C'mon let's leave!

1439
01:58:36,993 --> 01:58:38,404
Sit down Mr. Teja.

1440
01:58:38,615 --> 01:58:41,050
You'll leave only
after you finish your dinner.

1441
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:44,202
No.
- Where are you going madam?

1442
01:58:44,961 --> 01:58:49,123
You'll feed Teja
with your pretty hands.

1443
01:58:49,243 --> 01:58:53,355
I've brought special your dinner.

1444
01:58:53,785 --> 01:58:57,588
White pebbles,
which you mix in rice.

1445
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:01,309
Black ones for the lentils.

1446
01:59:02,543 --> 01:59:05,736
And the brown ones for the wheat.

1447
01:59:06,075 --> 01:59:08,903
You've to eat this today.

1448
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:12,191
She'll feed you
with a silver spoon.

1449
01:59:12,554 --> 01:59:15,272
Start feeding madam! C'mon.

1450
01:59:17,133 --> 01:59:19,327
Pick up the spoon!
- Yes.

1451
01:59:20,929 --> 01:59:24,575
Mr. Teja. Please.
- Open your mouth Teja!

1452
01:59:26,569 --> 01:59:28,407
Please, I'm sorry.

1453
01:59:33,737 --> 01:59:36,710
Now feed him the lentils.

1454
01:59:38,803 --> 01:59:40,046
Very good.

1455
01:59:40,479 --> 01:59:42,870
Mr. Teja open your mouth.

1456
01:59:48,846 --> 01:59:51,371
You'll be glad to hear that.

1457
01:59:51,648 --> 01:59:54,874
I've got the addresses of all
your warehouses and offices.

1458
01:59:55,458 --> 01:59:56,863
Keep chewing!

1459
02:00:00,118 --> 02:00:04,363
The police is raiding
all your warehouses at this minute.

1460
02:00:04,809 --> 02:00:06,724
You are ruined!

1461
02:00:41,632 --> 02:00:44,655
Who are you?
- An Indian.

1462
02:00:45,418 --> 02:00:49,271
Who knows what hunger feels like.

1463
02:01:00,568 --> 02:01:02,702
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1464
02:01:02,822 --> 02:01:04,596
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1465
02:01:04,716 --> 02:01:06,962
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1466
02:01:07,082 --> 02:01:08,584
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1467
02:01:08,704 --> 02:01:10,616
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1468
02:01:10,736 --> 02:01:14,673
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1469
02:01:14,793 --> 02:01:18,611
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1470
02:01:18,731 --> 02:01:22,933
Mr. India...
- Long Live.

1471
02:01:23,184 --> 02:01:28,716
There are protests everywhere apart
from bombay, kolkata and bangalore.

1472
02:01:29,309 --> 02:01:31,804
Today a government speaker gave us
an information

1473
02:01:31,924 --> 02:01:36,623
that Mr. India has helped raid
illegal godowns and factories

1474
02:01:36,743 --> 02:01:38,608
and helped the government a lot.

1475
02:01:38,824 --> 02:01:40,654
But, Who is Mr. India?

1476
02:01:40,774 --> 02:01:43,944
Nobody can tell this with
conviction even today.

1477
02:01:44,749 --> 02:01:47,128
In the Parliament session today,
the opposition party.

1478
02:01:47,248 --> 02:01:51,111
Demanded the ruling party to give
all the information about Mr. India.

1479
02:01:51,385 --> 02:01:54,447
Arun bro, I know who is Mr. India.
- Hey, shut up.

1480
02:01:54,567 --> 02:01:56,004
Hey Shut up.
- Tell me who is it?

1481
02:01:56,292 --> 02:01:58,757
My classmates were discussing
that Mr. India is in the Army.

1482
02:01:58,962 --> 02:02:00,504
In the Army?
- Yes.

1483
02:02:00,624 --> 02:02:03,524
And that's why he is fighting with
our nation's enemies. - Just shut up.

1484
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:06,499
Ohhh. - Arun bro,
I know who is Mr. India?

1485
02:02:06,703 --> 02:02:09,588
My teacher says, he is a Doctor.
- A Doctor?

1486
02:02:09,791 --> 02:02:12,710
- Yes, and that's why he help raid
the illegal food godowns.

1487
02:02:13,517 --> 02:02:17,399
That's enough Arun bro, Switch off
the TV and let's get out of here.

1488
02:02:17,519 --> 02:02:19,595
Or else Sister Seema will come and
catch us red handed.

1489
02:02:19,768 --> 02:02:22,384
But how will she come...
Today evening...

1490
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:26,037
Oh... I didn't even realise that.

1491
02:02:26,693 --> 02:02:32,087
Mr. India,
you've so much love for people.

1492
02:02:32,304 --> 02:02:35,791
Just for people? Not you?

1493
02:02:36,388 --> 02:02:40,304
How would I know?
You never said anything.

1494
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:42,722
Does it have to be told?

1495
02:02:43,353 --> 02:02:44,304
No.

1496
02:02:44,555 --> 02:02:48,181
Some matters are best
said through the eyes.

1497
02:02:49,931 --> 02:02:52,639
But even that can't be done.

1498
02:02:52,931 --> 02:02:58,014
What you couldn't hear
till today nor see.

1499
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:01,264
I'll come close to you and say it.

1500
02:03:01,597 --> 02:03:02,920
Very close!

1501
02:03:03,775 --> 02:03:07,055
Touching you!
Taking you in my arms!

1502
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:12,014
I'll say it in such a way,
you can feel it with your lips.

1503
02:03:44,725 --> 02:03:47,607
"I love you."

1504
02:03:48,512 --> 02:03:51,939
"These days and nights
are tough to spend."

1505
02:03:52,059 --> 02:03:55,478
"Wanting to pour
my heart out to you."

1506
02:03:55,598 --> 02:03:58,897
"These days and nights
are tough to spend."

1507
02:03:59,017 --> 02:04:02,486
"Wanting to pour
my heart out to you."

1508
02:04:02,606 --> 02:04:07,072
"Let me say it to you tonight."

1509
02:04:07,767 --> 02:04:11,160
"I love you."

1510
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:14,573
"I love you."

1511
02:04:14,808 --> 02:04:17,963
"I love you."

1512
02:04:18,348 --> 02:04:21,558
"I love you."

1513
02:04:22,059 --> 02:04:25,009
"I love you."

1514
02:04:25,308 --> 02:04:28,605
"In solitude
with only you beside me."

1515
02:04:28,725 --> 02:04:32,146
"I wished to let
a secret out to you."

1516
02:04:32,266 --> 02:04:35,813
"In solitude with
only you beside me."

1517
02:04:35,933 --> 02:04:39,384
"I wished to let
a secret out to you."

1518
02:04:39,558 --> 02:04:44,132
"I shall say it tonight."

1519
02:04:44,642 --> 02:04:47,266
"I love you."

1520
02:04:48,100 --> 02:04:51,183
"I love you."

1521

"I love you."

1523
02:04:58,558 --> 02:05:02,366
"I love you."

1524
02:07:41,577 --> 02:07:45,150
"Full of fragrance.
- Is your body!"

1525
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:48,657
"Totally ecstatic.
- Is my heart!"

1526
02:07:48,777 --> 02:07:52,240
"Full of fragrance.
- Is your body!"

1527
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:55,782
"Totally ecstatic.
- Is my heart!"

1528
02:07:55,902 --> 02:07:59,437
"Oozing with desire.
- Is your beauty!"

1529
02:07:59,604 --> 02:08:03,031
"Slowly but surely.
- I'm being intoxicated."

1530
02:08:03,151 --> 02:08:06,498
"Oozing with desire.
- Is your beauty!"

1531
02:08:06,618 --> 02:08:10,270
"Slowly but surely.
- I'm being intoxicated."

1532
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:16,983
I'm being intoxicated."

1533
02:08:17,103 --> 02:08:20,650
"Now that I'm so close to you."

1534
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:24,051
"I must tell you my secret."

1535
02:08:24,228 --> 02:08:27,595
"Now that I'm so close to you."

1536
02:08:27,715 --> 02:08:31,365

1537
02:08:31,485 --> 02:08:36,449

02:09:31,193 --> 02:09:34,421
"I love you."

1553
02:09:34,978 --> 02:09:38,393
"I love you."

1554
02:09:38,885 --> 02:09:43,062
"I love you."
- love you.

1555
02:10:09,673 --> 02:10:10,487
Tongue.

1556
02:10:12,001 --> 02:10:12,931
Teeth!

1557
02:10:13,472 --> 02:10:14,360
Broke.

1558
02:10:14,556 --> 02:10:15,584
Next!

1559
02:10:16,597 --> 02:10:17,834
Nails!

1560
02:10:18,984 --> 02:10:20,430
Teeth!

1561
02:10:21,472 --> 02:10:23,370
Next! Come Tina.

1562
02:10:24,931 --> 02:10:27,312
Tongue! Teeth!

1563
02:10:28,305 --> 02:10:32,097
Nails! At the back
of the palm not in front.

1564
02:10:32,347 --> 02:10:34,640
Didn't cut your nails?

1565
02:10:35,097 --> 02:10:36,380
I did.

1566
02:10:37,597 --> 02:10:41,556
But they grow back.
- Really? Kummi cut her nails.

1567
02:10:41,889 --> 02:10:44,054
Nails!
- Arun!

1568
02:10:44,472 --> 02:10:47,264
Did you hear? Lord Hanuman's idol
has been stolen from the temple!

1569
02:10:47,472 --> 02:10:49,312
Who could've done this?

1570
02:10:49,764 --> 02:10:53,889
I know. Daga the big businessman
of the city has stolen it.

1571
02:10:55,950 --> 02:10:57,847
Where can I find Mr. India now?

1572
02:11:01,243 --> 02:11:04,131
Fantastic!

1573
02:11:10,303 --> 02:11:13,090
You've got
what you wanted Mr. Walcott.

1574
02:11:13,413 --> 02:11:16,007
In return what we want..
- You'll get it!

1575
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:17,409
Johnny!

1576
02:11:24,369 --> 02:11:26,651
Good! Very Good!

1577
02:11:27,916 --> 02:11:31,138
Vinod!
Store everything in the basement.

1578
02:11:31,507 --> 02:11:35,122
Tomorrow I'll take the golden idol
out of India in my private jet.

1579
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:36,757
Sure why not?

1580
02:11:37,158 --> 02:11:43,628
Soon Indians won't need a temple,
or a place to worship or

1581
02:11:43,863 --> 02:11:46,814
a god or goddess to pray to.

1582
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:48,932
Because the day
is nearing Mr. Walcott,

1583
02:11:49,181 --> 02:11:53,132
when the 80 crore
population will bow,

1584
02:11:53,611 --> 02:11:56,750
only to Mogambo! And before us!

1585
02:11:57,390 --> 02:11:59,299
That day is not too far,

1586
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:04,138
when the life and death of Indians
will be in our hands!

1587
02:12:04,693 --> 02:12:09,587
And then the population of India
will only worship us. Only us!

1588
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:15,252
We'll be the new gods
of this nation Mr. Walcott!

1589
02:12:20,643 --> 02:12:21,764
Indian god hits too!

1590
02:12:22,373 --> 02:12:23,757
***! Shameless!

1591
02:12:24,169 --> 02:12:28,866
On one hand you sell these pure
idols to these foreigners.

1592
02:12:29,021 --> 02:12:30,197
On the other hand,

1593
02:12:30,523 --> 02:12:34,299
you ruin the lives of poor Indians
for your own selfish needs!

1594
02:12:34,818 --> 02:12:40,754
If you had your way, you'd sell
our lives, souls and our country!

1595
02:12:41,048 --> 02:12:43,598
I won't allow this to happen!

1596
02:12:51,013 --> 02:12:52,377
It also laughs!

1597
02:12:52,576 --> 02:12:55,462
Wait! You're my Hanuman!

1598
02:13:26,822 --> 02:13:29,825
You want to be the new god
of this country? - Yes!

1599
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:31,657
Yes?
- No!

1600
02:13:33,764 --> 02:13:37,147
Daga you're the devil not god!

1601
02:13:37,601 --> 02:13:39,338
No!
- The devil!

1602
02:13:39,458 --> 02:13:40,970
No!
- Traitor!

1603
02:13:41,090 --> 02:13:42,203
No!

1604
02:13:57,663 --> 02:14:01,638
Good god!
- Now you take my name!

1605
02:14:01,758 --> 02:14:04,426
Hail lord Hanuman!

1606
02:14:05,570 --> 02:14:07,418
Hail lord Hanuman!

1607
02:14:07,538 --> 02:14:11,038
You Englishman!
Where are you fleeing?

1608
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:16,716
I didn't know you
were holy for the Indians.

1609
02:14:16,836 --> 02:14:19,371
I'm a donkey!

1610
02:14:19,788 --> 02:14:22,080
I'm a fool! You are god!

1611
02:14:22,454 --> 02:14:26,116
I know it.
- Will you steal idols?

1612
02:14:27,246 --> 02:14:28,871
No lord Hanuman!

1613
02:14:35,538 --> 02:14:37,795
What happened O lord?

1614
02:14:38,038 --> 02:14:41,038
What crime have I done?

1615
02:14:41,329 --> 02:14:46,923
Will you sell guns to
these traitors? - No lord Hanuman!

1616
02:14:47,551 --> 02:14:50,002
Hail lord Hanuman!

1617
02:14:50,122 --> 02:14:52,003
Hail lord Hanuman!

1618
02:14:52,163 --> 02:14:54,871
Hail lord Hanuman!

1619
02:14:55,122 --> 02:14:56,579
Hail lord Hanuman!

1620
02:14:58,579 --> 02:15:01,209
Sorry lord Hanuman!

1621
02:15:01,329 --> 02:15:03,751
No lord Hanuman!

1622
02:15:03,871 --> 02:15:06,165
O lord Hanuman!

1623
02:15:06,955 --> 02:15:09,376
Say Mr. Walcott!
Hail lord Hanuman!

1624
02:15:09,496 --> 02:15:11,830
What did you say?
- Hail lord Hanuman!

1625
02:15:11,955 --> 02:15:13,693
Hail lord Hanuman!?

1626
02:15:14,813 --> 02:15:16,788
Hail lord Hanuman!?

1627
02:15:16,913 --> 02:15:18,705
Say it again!
- Hail lord Hanuman!

1628
02:15:18,955 --> 02:15:20,669
Louder!
- Hail lord Hanuman!

1629
02:15:20,955 --> 02:15:24,460
From your heart!
- Hail lord Hanuman!

1630
02:15:27,004 --> 02:15:29,525
Hail Mother Goddess...

1631
02:15:29,645 --> 02:15:32,160
Hail Mother Goddess...

1632
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:34,114
Hail Mother Goddess...

1633
02:15:51,422 --> 02:15:54,173
Sir there's the lord Hanuman
idol which was stolen.

1634
02:15:54,293 --> 02:15:55,501
Yes!

1635
02:16:02,250 --> 02:16:03,376
Drugs?

1636
02:16:06,386 --> 02:16:08,096
Oh my god bombs!

1637
02:16:08,216 --> 02:16:10,281
This is just the tip
of an iceberg officer.

1638
02:16:10,498 --> 02:16:14,792
If you search this house,
you'll find out about a gang,

1639
02:16:14,917 --> 02:16:17,126
who wants to destroy India.

1640
02:16:17,299 --> 02:16:21,084
Mr. India?
- Yes I had called you.

1641
02:16:21,667 --> 02:16:24,950
Thank you very much Mr. India.

1642
02:16:25,240 --> 02:16:28,625
No officer,
I've done nothing as yet.

1643
02:16:29,198 --> 02:16:32,541
My work is incomplete.
It'll finish on the day,

1644
02:16:32,834 --> 02:16:37,056
when the enemy of India,
Mogambo meets his end.

1645
02:16:42,852 --> 02:16:44,923
By defeating Daga and Teja,

1646
02:16:45,043 --> 02:16:47,792
does Mr. India think
he's the protector of India?

1647
02:16:48,298 --> 02:16:51,466
Does he think he
can clash with me?

1648
02:16:52,288 --> 02:16:54,950
With me? With Mogambo?

1649
02:16:59,388 --> 02:17:01,771
And these *** Indians!

1650
02:17:02,431 --> 02:17:05,220
Let's see how he helps them!

1651
02:17:05,667 --> 02:17:06,667
Captain Zorro!

1652
02:17:06,875 --> 02:17:11,876
Bombs must explode in various
cities, roads, markets of India!

1653
02:17:12,126 --> 02:17:14,751
In transistors, books, toys!

1654
02:17:15,084 --> 02:17:20,209
Spread such fear that every person
will think before leaving his home

1655
02:17:20,990 --> 02:17:23,756
that this might be his last step!

1656
02:17:24,243 --> 02:17:27,304
Run...

1657
02:17:39,714 --> 02:17:41,676
Round and round!

1658
02:17:41,796 --> 02:17:44,339
Hold it! Don't let it go!

1659
02:17:46,120 --> 02:17:49,095
Cheeku hold tight!
Don't fall off!

1660
02:17:49,633 --> 02:17:50,880
Round and round!

1661
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,244
C'mon children!

1662
02:18:01,229 --> 02:18:04,065
Brother Arun put me down.
I want to go there.

1663
02:18:04,185 --> 02:18:06,172
Ok go, take care.

1664
02:18:13,499 --> 02:18:15,094
Kummi!
- Tina.

1665
02:18:15,214 --> 02:18:16,741
Tina.

1666
02:18:16,861 --> 02:18:19,421
What is that?

1667
02:18:20,208 --> 02:18:21,706
Kunnu.

1668
02:18:21,941 --> 02:18:24,000
Kummi what is that?

1669
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:27,438
Tina!

1670
02:19:31,122 --> 02:19:34,336
Sister! Hurry! Move aside!

1671
02:19:35,466 --> 02:19:36,490
Move please.

1672
02:19:36,915 --> 02:19:40,179
Tina... Tina... Nothing will happen
to you Tina.

1673
02:19:40,299 --> 02:19:42,761
I am here... we all are there with
you.

1674
02:19:43,884 --> 02:19:45,169
Please Move.

1675
02:19:45,289 --> 02:19:47,884
Doctor our Tina is badly hurt!

1676
02:19:48,004 --> 02:19:50,123
Prepare for operation!
- Ok doctor.

1677
02:20:08,929 --> 02:20:11,161
Give this to me... and go quickly
bring the glucose.

1678
02:20:47,417 --> 02:20:49,810
Tina!

1679
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:19,893
Tina!

1680
02:21:23,833 --> 02:21:25,435
Tina!

1681
02:23:34,915 --> 02:23:37,878
He may try hard but Mr. India
can't change Indian's fate!

1682
02:23:37,998 --> 02:23:41,956
Hail Mogambo! - Indian people
are fated to be Mogambo's slaves!

1683
02:23:42,082 --> 02:23:45,331
But first they'll
face destruction!

1684
02:23:46,662 --> 02:23:47,952
Hail Mogambo!

1685
02:23:49,335 --> 02:23:53,213
Dr. Watson are the missiles
ready to attack India?

1686
02:23:53,390 --> 02:23:56,005
Yes Mr. Mogambo.
We're only waiting for your orders.

1687
02:24:12,086 --> 02:24:15,318
I want to look at my missiles.

1688
02:24:18,359 --> 02:24:22,329
These buttons will get the missiles
out of the underground bunkers.

1689
02:24:49,208 --> 02:24:51,488
Mogambo is pleased!

1690
02:24:52,362 --> 02:24:54,663
Dr. Watson next.

1691
02:24:54,917 --> 02:24:56,799
This button starts the countdown.

1692
02:24:56,937 --> 02:24:58,630
Missiles would be ready
for take off Sir.

1693
02:24:58,750 --> 02:25:01,611
Press the button!
- But sir!

1694
02:25:01,817 --> 02:25:03,305
Press the button... Dr Watson.

1695
02:25:08,363 --> 02:25:11,936
60 seconds after the countdown
begins, there will be a blast.

1696
02:25:12,056 --> 02:25:13,608
And the missiles will take off.

1697
02:25:13,802 --> 02:25:16,345
They can be stopped
while there are 20 seconds left.

1698
02:25:16,535 --> 02:25:19,653
After that if you try to stop them
there will be an earthquake here.

1699
02:25:19,773 --> 02:25:23,206
Missiles will explode
and the island will be destroyed!

1700
02:25:25,959 --> 02:25:29,064
And if they aren't stopped.
- These missiles will take off.

1701
02:25:29,332 --> 02:25:31,430
Travelling hundreds of miles,

1702
02:25:31,776 --> 02:25:34,463
they'll explode
in various cities of India.

1703
02:25:34,824 --> 02:25:36,676
Indian cities will be destroyed!

1704
02:25:36,914 --> 02:25:40,317
But Mr. Mogambo
Mr. India will also die,

1705
02:25:40,437 --> 02:25:42,460
with him that formula
will also be destroyed.

1706
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:46,447
Dr. Fumancho you are a fool!

1707
02:25:47,668 --> 02:25:53,387
Why haven't I launched these
missiles on India until now?

1708
02:25:53,956 --> 02:25:57,535
Captain Zorro,
according to our computers,

1709
02:25:58,014 --> 02:26:01,241
Mr. India loves the entire country.

1710
02:26:01,771 --> 02:26:05,324
Specially those orphan children.

1711
02:26:05,790 --> 02:26:09,715
Who live with
that good-for-nothing violinist.

1712
02:26:10,557 --> 02:26:12,706
You know what you've to do.

1713
02:26:21,407 --> 02:26:23,719
Put them all in the vehicle!
C'mon!

1714
02:26:23,839 --> 02:26:25,802
Hurry up!
- Brother Arun!

1715
02:26:40,289 --> 02:26:42,912
Hail Mogambo!

1716
02:26:43,032 --> 02:26:45,442
Hail Mogambo!

1717
02:26:45,562 --> 02:26:47,803
Hail Mogambo!

1718
02:26:47,923 --> 02:26:51,728
Hail Mogambo.

1719
02:26:59,295 --> 02:27:04,439
So these are the lowly children,
Mr. India loves so much?

1720
02:27:09,647 --> 02:27:12,096
If you value your lives,

1721
02:27:13,338 --> 02:27:17,889
tell me who he is
and where can I find him.

1722
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:23,008
If you don't answer me,

1723
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:26,002
I'll throw all of you
into this acid!

1724
02:27:26,122 --> 02:27:28,157
You'll crumble to the bones!

1725
02:27:28,449 --> 02:27:29,656
Captain Zorro!

1726
02:27:30,315 --> 02:27:33,677
One by one, take the kids.
- No!

1727
02:27:34,490 --> 02:27:36,203
No!

1728
02:27:36,323 --> 02:27:38,781
Not the kids! No!

1729
02:27:39,381 --> 02:27:40,883
Mogambo!

1730
02:27:42,003 --> 02:27:45,609
Listen to me!

1731
02:27:49,619 --> 02:27:52,198

1732
02:27:53,727 --> 02:27:56,382
Spare him Mogambo.
- No.

1733
02:27:58,513 --> 02:28:00,686
Mogambo spare him Mogambo.

1734
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:03,306
Brother Arun
- Mogambo.

1735
02:28:03,518 --> 02:28:05,017
I'm Mr. India.

1736
02:28:05,751 --> 02:28:08,789
Mogambo I'm Mr. India.

1737
02:28:12,122 --> 02:28:13,601
I'm Mr. India.

1738
02:28:14,437 --> 02:28:16,312
No, he's lying!

1739
02:28:16,644 --> 02:28:18,677
Just to save the kids
and Mr. India.

1740
02:28:18,854 --> 02:28:21,104
He was easily beaten up by my men.

1741
02:28:21,229 --> 02:28:23,764
I slapped him in his house
and he did nothing.

1742
02:28:24,068 --> 02:28:25,396
He can't be Mr. India!

1743
02:28:26,793 --> 02:28:27,817
Silence!

1744
02:28:41,065 --> 02:28:45,174
So you are Mr. India?

1745
02:28:46,065 --> 02:28:47,607
Let's see you disappear!

1746
02:28:47,732 --> 02:28:51,196
Untie my hands and I'll show you.

1747
02:28:54,774 --> 02:28:57,761
You can't fool Mogambo.

1748
02:28:58,491 --> 02:29:00,168
Take them away and lock them up!

1749
02:29:00,328 --> 02:29:02,815
Listen to me!

1750
02:29:22,424 --> 02:29:26,011
Seema... untie my hands just once.

1751
02:29:26,131 --> 02:29:29,850
You think lying like this you can
win... you can save all of us.

1752
02:29:37,238 --> 02:29:39,979
Please untie my hands.

1753
02:29:42,656 --> 02:29:44,693
I'm not lying. I'm Mr. India.

1754
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,236
Look!

1755
02:29:51,486 --> 02:29:52,735
Where is it?

1756
02:29:59,014 --> 02:30:02,344
So you are him?
- Yes.

1757
02:30:04,489 --> 02:30:06,034
Arun!

1758
02:30:11,186 --> 02:30:14,781
I wish Mr. India would really come.

1759
02:30:15,508 --> 02:30:17,467
There's no Mr.
India other than me!

1760
02:30:19,018 --> 02:30:22,043
Jugal, how do I explain to them?

1761
02:30:23,925 --> 02:30:25,319
I'm telling the truth children.

1762
02:30:26,065 --> 02:30:30,146
Don't be under false hopes that
Mr. India will come to save you.

1763
02:30:31,176 --> 02:30:32,739
Because I'm Mr. India!

1764
02:30:32,982 --> 02:30:36,190
But I don't have any proof
to make you believe me.

1765
02:30:36,428 --> 02:30:38,517
I believe you! You are Mr. India.

1766
02:30:38,637 --> 02:30:41,306
I believe it too.
- So do I.

1767
02:30:41,458 --> 02:30:42,933
Me too.
- In you, I believe.

1768
02:30:43,053 --> 02:30:45,566
Me too, we know you never lie.

1769
02:30:53,624 --> 02:30:55,770
Madam don't expect anyone.

1770
02:31:03,272 --> 02:31:05,913
Ronnie, what's round your neck?
- Magnet!

1771
02:31:09,566 --> 02:31:10,798
Remove your belts.

1772
02:31:10,953 --> 02:31:14,548
The time is not far off
when Mogambo will be crowned.

1773
02:31:14,668 --> 02:31:17,341
Captain Zorro get my crown.

1774
02:31:20,632 --> 02:31:23,506
Where did the bracelet fall?

1775
02:31:24,215 --> 02:31:26,965
Now I recall.
When I barged into the trolley,

1776
02:31:27,257 --> 02:31:29,007
it would've fallen into it.

1777
02:31:34,114 --> 02:31:36,089
Take this Crown along to
show Mr. Mogambo.

1778
02:31:38,423 --> 02:31:40,226
Oh no.

1779
02:31:40,667 --> 02:31:42,890
Let us try one more time... Yes.

1780
02:31:43,146 --> 02:31:44,596
Yes!

1781
02:32:22,289 --> 02:32:24,961
Hurry up!

1782
02:32:25,081 --> 02:32:28,944
Not this way that way, c'mon.

02:32:30,247 --> 02:32:33,039
Let's go madam hurry up.

1784
02:32:36,296 --> 02:32:40,251
C'mon on hide.

- Hail Mogambo!

1786
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:49,266

1787
02:32:50,037 --> 02:32:51,446

02:32:58,407 --> 02:33:01,290
Calendar, you, the kids
and madam go this way. - But you.

1790
02:33:01,489 --> 02:33:02,727
I'll get the bracelet.

1791
02:33:02,847 --> 02:33:05,990
Where will you hunt for it?
Where could the trolley be?

1792
02:33:06,416 --> 02:33:08,816
No matter what, the bracelet
shouldn't fall in their hands.

1793
02:33:08,936 --> 02:33:10,649
They will misuse it.

1794
02:33:10,769 --> 02:33:11,579
Go on, I'll follow.
- Ok.

1795
02:33:11,699 --> 02:33:12,911
C'mon hurry up.
- Come with me.

1796
02:33:15,935 --> 02:33:17,407
Go madam.

1797
02:33:17,811 --> 02:33:20,239
You've supported me so many times.

1798
02:33:21,207 --> 02:33:25,057
Do you think
I'll leave you alone now?

1799
02:33:29,681 --> 02:33:33,360
No Mr. India. I can't do this.

1800
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:49,997
"I love you."

1801
02:33:50,282 --> 02:33:53,837
"I love you."

1802
02:33:54,122 --> 02:33:57,680
"I love you."

1803
02:34:19,532 --> 02:34:20,615
Who are you?

1804
02:34:21,198 --> 02:34:22,282
Hail Mogambo!

1805
02:34:23,490 --> 02:34:24,777
Hello?

1806
02:34:30,059 --> 02:34:31,864
Come take some rest.

1807
02:34:36,321 --> 02:34:37,595
Come on.

1808
02:34:37,715 --> 02:34:39,459
Arun bro... its you.
- Why are you running this way?

1809
02:34:39,579 --> 02:34:41,213
We ended up running where we
started from.

1810
02:34:41,333 --> 02:34:43,023
By god, these ways are
very confusing

1811
02:34:43,143 --> 02:34:45,177
Run... quickly...

1812
02:34:47,272 --> 02:34:49,479
Come on get in...

1813
02:34:49,599 --> 02:34:51,807
You all wait here...
Calendar I will come in a while.

1814
02:34:53,464 --> 02:34:56,989
Oh my gosh...

1815
02:34:57,203 --> 02:34:58,392
Calendar What is this?

1816
02:34:58,666 --> 02:35:00,180
What is this Calendar?
- Stop all of this.

1817
02:35:00,655 --> 02:35:02,139
What is this Calendar?
- Its my head.

1818
02:35:02,259 --> 02:35:03,850
Here our live are in danger...

1819
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:07,522
and you are asking what is this
and what is that?

1820
02:35:08,097 --> 02:35:09,827
What is this?

1821
02:35:11,452 --> 02:35:15,101
My name is Calendar.
- What your name is please?

1822
02:35:19,355 --> 02:35:23,563
My loyal men who bow before me!

1823
02:35:24,578 --> 02:35:27,563
My missiles are ready.
My army is ready.

1824
02:35:27,687 --> 02:35:31,483
Many of India's enemy
nations are ready to support me.

1825
02:35:31,603 --> 02:35:35,977
Captain Zorro.
Bring Mr. India's fans here.

1826
02:35:36,896 --> 02:35:39,787
Everything is happening
the way Mogambo wanted.

1827
02:35:40,603 --> 02:35:45,693
Only the invisibility formula
which makes man invisible,

1828
02:35:46,563 --> 02:35:48,854
will soon be at my feet.

1829
02:35:55,916 --> 02:35:58,473
What are you doing here?
- Waiting for Seema.

1830
02:35:58,593 --> 02:36:00,836
Strange! She went away
and made me wait...

1831
02:36:07,503 --> 02:36:09,550
Calendar they have caught Arun.

1832
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:11,836
We can't keep quiet.
We'll have to do something.

1833
02:36:12,158 --> 02:36:14,371
*** Indian!

1834
02:36:14,549 --> 02:36:19,141
Do you think you can succeed
in escaping my confinement?

1835
02:36:19,545 --> 02:36:24,628
Where will you escape? Now your
whole country will be mine!

1836
02:36:24,961 --> 02:36:28,420
The time of your death has arrived.

1837
02:36:29,086 --> 02:36:34,169
It's the royal tradition that
a death man's wishes are granted.

1838
02:36:35,545 --> 02:36:38,253
Tell me if you've a last wish.

1839
02:36:43,978 --> 02:36:48,378
Tell me.
- Mr. Mogambo my last wish is,

1840
02:36:49,262 --> 02:36:53,211
that I acknowledge before death
that I was mistaken.

1841
02:36:53,885 --> 02:36:58,967
I want to do this by touching
the feet of the great Mogambo.

1842
02:36:59,445 --> 02:37:01,113
Mogambo is pleased!

1843
02:37:01,364 --> 02:37:04,614
Just once I want to fall
at your feet and say.

1844
02:37:04,895 --> 02:37:06,932
Hail Mogambo!

1845
02:37:07,132 --> 02:37:10,491
I want to say
Mogambo has the right,

1846
02:37:10,672 --> 02:37:14,125
to rule over the whole world!

1847
02:37:14,309 --> 02:37:16,293
Mogambo is very pleased!

1848
02:37:16,413 --> 02:37:19,712
I want to say that death
at the feet of,

1849
02:37:19,963 --> 02:37:26,841
the great and noble Mogambo
is better than life!

1850
02:37:27,573 --> 02:37:29,368
Mogambo,

1851
02:37:32,235 --> 02:37:34,040
is very pleased!

1852
02:37:36,565 --> 02:37:38,376
God like Mogambo.

1853
02:37:39,589 --> 02:37:45,434
I offer myself and my life,
at your feet.

1854
02:37:45,658 --> 02:37:51,204
At your feet.

1855
02:37:55,868 --> 02:38:02,184
How easily
these Indians accept defeat?

1856
02:38:02,386 --> 02:38:04,259
Today just this Indian.

1857
02:38:04,972 --> 02:38:08,382
Tomorrow all of India
will bow at my feet!

1858
02:38:08,981 --> 02:38:11,815
You'll get to see it!

1859
02:38:12,564 --> 02:38:17,273
Tomorrow the whole
of India will bow at my feet.

1860
02:38:17,512 --> 02:38:18,940
Just as this...

1861
02:38:19,864 --> 02:38:21,425
Where is he?

1862
02:38:25,924 --> 02:38:27,632
Mr. India?...
- Mr. India.

1863
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:30,227
Guards
- Mr. India is here.

1864
02:38:30,533 --> 02:38:31,638
Fire!

1865
02:38:33,055 --> 02:38:36,293
Stop! Stop!

1866
02:38:45,344 --> 02:38:46,663
Fire

1867
02:38:49,341 --> 02:38:51,687
Stop Stop Stop Stop!

1868
02:39:26,207 --> 02:39:27,755
Oh god!
- Very good!

1869
02:39:29,130 --> 02:39:32,470
Mr. India your game is up!

1870
02:39:32,921 --> 02:39:35,505
Show up! Else the girl..

1871
02:39:36,130 --> 02:39:37,464
Captain Zorro!

1872
02:39:41,755 --> 02:39:42,713
Stop!

1873
02:39:46,629 --> 02:39:48,338
Mr. India!

1874
02:39:49,921 --> 02:39:51,671
The formula?

1875
02:40:30,332 --> 02:40:33,001
Ms. HawaHawaiii...

1876
02:41:21,936 --> 02:41:24,353
Block all the gates!
Let nobody in!

1877
02:41:24,518 --> 02:41:27,154
Let me see
how Mr. India saves India!

1878
02:41:27,936 --> 02:41:31,572
Switch on all the red lights.
Keep the guns ready.

1879
02:41:31,692 --> 02:41:34,894
I've found out Mr. India
can be seen in red light.

1880
02:41:58,394 --> 02:42:01,274
Mr. India!
Wherever you are, hear this.

1881
02:42:01,394 --> 02:42:03,518
You've lost this war with Mogambo.

1882
02:42:03,936 --> 02:42:09,518
My finger is on the button
which will send the missiles off.

1883
02:42:09,727 --> 02:42:12,774
And destroy every corner of India!

1884
02:42:12,894 --> 02:42:16,477
It would be better
if you surrender to us.

1885
02:42:16,852 --> 02:42:18,061
Mr. India!

1886
02:42:18,269 --> 02:42:22,315
If you don't hand yourself over
to my men within one minute.

1887
02:42:22,435 --> 02:42:24,602
This button will be pressed.

1888
02:43:12,644 --> 02:43:17,163
Mr India. now nobody can save your
India from me.

1889
02:43:17,533 --> 02:43:18,807
Who is it?

1890
02:43:24,794 --> 02:43:25,726
Mr. India?

1891
02:43:25,846 --> 02:43:27,309
No Mogambo.

1892
02:43:27,917 --> 02:43:32,694
I am not Mr. India but a common
and simple Indian.

1893
02:43:33,401 --> 02:43:35,847
Who resides in every city of India.

1894
02:43:36,090 --> 02:43:41,208
Is in every home, walks every city.

1895
02:43:48,655 --> 02:43:52,732
Mogambo, I'll take you
on not as Mr. India.

1896
02:43:53,407 --> 02:43:55,863
But as an ordinary Indian.

1897
02:43:56,524 --> 02:43:59,363
Because an ordinary Indian
is enough for you.

1898
02:43:59,593 --> 02:44:06,307
Then I'll crush this ordinary
Indian like a pest!

1899
02:46:41,411 --> 02:46:44,764
Don't think you've won Mr. India.

1900
02:46:45,028 --> 02:46:48,139
I've pressed the button.
In a few seconds,

1901
02:46:48,533 --> 02:46:53,688
my missiles will take off
to destroy India!

1902
02:47:18,961 --> 02:47:22,922
No! You can't do anything now!
The missiles have been charged!

1903
02:47:23,289 --> 02:47:28,592
Now if you stop them,
the missiles will explode here.

1904
02:47:28,820 --> 02:47:32,839
Save yourself now!

1905
02:47:34,632 --> 02:47:37,940
Or your India!

1906
02:48:00,739 --> 02:48:02,852
The missile is going to blast...

1907
02:48:02,972 --> 02:48:06,493
This island will burn into ashes...
- Run...

1908
02:48:44,783 --> 02:48:46,091
Seema!

1909
02:48:47,613 --> 02:48:48,941
Seema!

1910
02:48:53,493 --> 02:48:54,645
Seema!

1911
02:48:58,171 --> 02:49:00,307
C'mon hurry up!

1912
02:49:01,625 --> 02:49:05,002
Calendar, are the children ok?

1913
02:49:45,412 --> 02:49:48,664
Brother Arun!

1914
02:50:03,108 --> 02:50:06,101
C'mon hurry up.
The island is going to blow up.

1915
02:50:06,361 --> 02:50:07,897
Come Chikoo.

1916
02:50:24,502 --> 02:50:27,069
Hail Mogambo.

1917
02:50:46,871 --> 02:50:48,272

- Give me too...

1918
02:50:49,172 --> 02:50:50,681
Oh Seema.

1919
02:50:50,801 --> 02:50:53,452
Now atleast tell me that
who is Mr. India.

1920
02:50:53,572 --> 02:50:55,102
Where can I find him?
I have a lot of work with him.

1921
02:50:55,222 --> 02:50:57,236

1922
02:50:57,356 --> 02:50:59,123

1923
02:50:59,243 --> 02:51:01,480
Atleast... okay... if you insist

1924
02:51:01,755 --> 02:51:03,529

1925
02:51:03,649 --> 02:51:05,032

02:51:05,334 --> 02:51:07,075
Okay so atleast tell me
who is Mr. India.

1927
02:51:07,195 --> 02:51:09,188
What is so important that you want
to meet Mr. India.

1928
02:51:09,308 --> 02:51:11,263
Hey look, Please try to
understand my problem.

1929
02:51:11,669 --> 02:51:13,996
He has fixed a lot of world's
major problems.

1930
02:51:14,116 --> 02:51:15,712
Can't he fix my telephone?

1931
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:19,098
This thing is difficult even
for Mr. India.

1932
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:38,237
"I'm in love with Mr. India."
