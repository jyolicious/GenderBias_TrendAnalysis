1
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:45,470
'Praise and disgrace are the result
of your own deeds.'

2
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:51,095
'Your shadow will always follow you.'

3
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:49,823
"Days, months and..

4
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:59,571
..years will pass."

5
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,829
"But my love will.."

6
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:12,992
"..never ebb."

7
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:17,781
"..never ebb."

8
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,474
Abdul!

9
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:21,789
Start the car.

10
00:03:30,864 --> 00:03:32,156
You're terrific!

11
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:39,972
It's not the flush of youth
that works here. But of experience.

12
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,144
Guy's a wizard!

13
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:48,571
Forget touching any car, he goes
close and they sway like lovers!

14
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:49,743
You are right, friend.

15
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:55,420
- Good day sir.
- Good day.

16
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:58,331
- Good news for you.
- Good news?

17
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:03,382
Your overtime for today is sure.
he is Sitaram.

18
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,969
He's Laxminarayan's driver.

19
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:10,230
Their car is not working.
Go with him to their house.

20
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,885
You'll get the price you quote.

21
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:17,411
I won't work overtime today.

22
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:22,019
What? You're the king of overtime.

23
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,558
And you're refusing a party.
Are you feeling well?

24
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:29,032
I sell my time everyday.

25
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:32,824
But I've kept this evening for myself.

26
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,271
I want to live for myself.

27
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:40,235
Excuse me for today.
I'll be there in the morning.

28
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:41,259
Okay!

29
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:49,347
Radha.

30
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:07,189
Congratulations on our
25 years of marriage.

31
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,059
To you too.

32
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:15,121
What's in this?

33
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:20,878
What are you doing?
The children are watching.

34
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:23,027
Children?

35
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,496
- Where's everybody?
- Gone for a film.

36
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:35,885
Film?

37
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,489
So only the two of us are at home?

38
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,784
This auspicious day...

39
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,364
And this solitude.
Good God you are great!

40
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,447
- What are you looking at?
- The lines of your destiny.

41
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,469
...which have grown dull thanks
to mundane household chores.

42
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:21,273
They are more deeply etched.

43
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:26,102
My destiny is shining
on your forehead.

44
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,548
25 years have gone by.
But it feels like yesterday.

45
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:18,045
"Day, months and years...

46
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:23,676
...will pass...

47
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:30,345
...but my love will never ebb."

48
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:33,545
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

49
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:39,289
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

50
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:45,754
"Day, months and years will pass...

51
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:51,345
...but my love will never ebb."

52
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:54,385
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

53
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:59,785
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

54
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:05,588
"Day, months and years will pass...

55
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:11,923
...but my love will never ebb."

56
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:14,891
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

57
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:20,387
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

58
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:26,581
"Day, months and years will pass."

59
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:59,159
"Know one thing that
I consider you as God..."

60
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:04,526
"Know one thing that
I consider you as God..."

61
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:10,370
"...I don't know anything
other than this."

62
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:16,059
"You have to know what
to tell and what not to."

63
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,188
"Now you know it."

64
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:23,987
"I'll do whatever you tell."

65
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:29,941
"But my love will never ebb."

66
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:32,865
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

67
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:38,545
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

68
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,619
"I want to share all
my joys and sorrows with you."

69
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:22,742
"I want to share all
my joys and sorrows with you."

70
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:30,008
"I've accepted you as my life-partner."

71
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:35,977
"You are my anchor."

72
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,482
"You are my anchor."

73
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:44,045
"Our love will only grow."

74
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,368
"But my love will never ebb."

75
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:52,530
"But my love will never ebb."

76
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:55,436
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

77
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,203
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

78
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:04,318
- "We'll see that.
- Sure, do so!"

79
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:29,845
Rascal! Scoundrel!

80
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,973
Despite so many warnings,
you haven't learnt a lesson!

81
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:35,497
- Daddy.
- Shut up!

82
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,577
He has forgotten his position
because you encourage him!

83
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,906
A pauper mechanic.
Who looks at our cars for his bread.

84
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:49,233
He dare do this! Rascal!

85
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,180
Do you know the consequences
of playing with my reputation?

86
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,084
I will wipe you out completely!

87
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,928
Come!

88
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,127
Open the door!

89
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:26,157
Sir...

90
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,818
...where is my Radha?

91
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,184
I've come to take her.

92
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:38,635
Don't be foolish. Talk sense.

93
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,330
You can write your
own destiny if you wish.

94
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,111
I haven't understood.

95
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,288
Come with me.

96
00:12:55,776 --> 00:13:00,754
Money can buy every feeling,
every moment of life.

97
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,166
This little scrap of paper can
buy humans not Just love.

98
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:11,252
It's a blank cheque.
Fill whatever you desire.

99
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,059
Can I fill in whatever I wish?

100
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,451
Yes, whatever you desire.

101
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:25,871
Jugal Kishore's cheque
is never dishonoured.

102
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:04,988
Here. Sir, honour your cheque.

103
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:12,418
Scoundrel! How dare you?

104
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:22,418
You said I could write
whatever I desired.

105
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:28,457
Honour your cheque now!
Give me my Radha!

106
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:29,447
Veeru.

107
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:34,612
Throw this dog out of the house!

108
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:25,907
Radha!

109
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:27,537
You...

110
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:29,707
You've come here?

111
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:36,337
I've left everything and come to you!

112
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:39,433
I've come home.

113
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:43,424
I've come to my own house!

114
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:33,730
You serve me like a devotee.

115
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:39,950
Silly boy, people don't give
so much respect to God these days!

116
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,527
You are my God.

117
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:49,268
What was our relationship?
I was an orphan.

118
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:54,256
In this crowd of unknown faces,
you held my hand.

119
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:57,233
Or I'd be lost long ago.

120
00:16:57,592 --> 00:17:03,184
If I can spend my life at these feet,
who can be luckier than me?

121
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:04,329
Me!

122
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,311
Sewak...

123
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,053
...God knows what relation we share.

124
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,624
Father.

125
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:19,868
Get my towel.

126
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:23,649
Mother, make cauliflower
stuffed pancakes today.

127
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,071
- I'll have brunch not breakfast
before I leave for college. - Okay.

128
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,926
Towel.

129
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,563
- Sewak.
- Yes mistress?

130
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,907
- Put some oil in the stove.
- Okay.

131
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:41,121
Ramesh. Daughter-in-law!
Are you still sleeping?

132
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:58,305
- Get my sari from the laundry.
- Sure.

133
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:02,577
- Good morning.
- Live long.

134
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:08,261
- Sewak.
- Coming!

135
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,765
- What is it?
- Iron these quickly.

136
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:14,977
I only see Sewak in this house.

137
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,804
he too has limited
horse power like any car.

138
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,922
If you put too much load,
it will suffer a breakdown.

139
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:24,946
If he is laid up in bed,
nobody will get anything done!

140
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:29,514
That is why I sleep on
the floor not on the cot!

141
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,071
- Chander.
- Yes.

142
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,586
How was the movie last night?

143
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,844
Very good till the interval!
After that she fell flat.

144
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:42,617
Fell flat? That's where the
directors of today lose out.

145
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:43,781
Take this!

146
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:58,827
In these times of inflation,
I somehow buy almonds for you.

147
00:18:59,032 --> 00:19:00,663
And you give them to the boys!

148
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:04,106
It's their time to
eat almonds not mine!

149
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:08,773
Open your mouth! Eat this.

150
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,076
- Ramesh.
- Yes.

151
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:14,782
- When is your Job interview?
- At 11 this morning.

152
00:19:15,494 --> 00:19:19,208
My blessings are with you.
God will give you success.

153
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,237
Thank you.

154
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,593
Let's go.

155
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:37,497
Found anything? Mr...

156
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:38,349
Avtaar Kishen.

157
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,985
It packs up every other day.

158
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,176
I've checked it out and
understood the problem.

159
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:49,287
- Hi, Daddy. Very good morning to you.
- Good morning, dear.

160
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:51,153
Come. Let's have some breakfast.

161
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:54,611
Have breakfast alone.
I'm very late for college.

162
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:58,218
- Get the car out.
- Your car is ready.

163
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,699
Wow! My car is ready.

164
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,757
That's nice.
Thank you very much, mechanic.

165
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,995
No need to thank me. It's my duty.

166
00:20:17,393 --> 00:20:19,469
Hello Chander.

167
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:27,497
What's wrong with my sleep
that it keeps me awake?

168
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:32,051
And your memory that never goes away!

169
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,681
"Betel from Banaras,
Pune, Mandwa or Bengal,"

170
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:47,323
"Which one will you have?"

171
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:50,125
"Apply some more lime."

172
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:53,369
Here you are.

173
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,965
Good day brother.

174
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:01,353
Good day. Add it to my account.

175
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,224
I certainly will.

176
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:09,959
- Good day to you.
- Good day Rashid!

177
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:13,053
Quickly give me some betel leaf.

178
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:16,413
Where are you these days?
You're like the elusive moon!

179
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:18,683
Even forgotten your friends!

180
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:22,217
I can forget myself not you!

181
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:27,233
As regards meeting you,
I have no time to breathe!

182
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,663
No point hiding from you.
Remember my son, Anwar?

183
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:34,511
- The one who is abroad?
- Yes.

184
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:39,216
He hardly writes letters
but sends draft after draft!

185
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,323
2000, 5000, 10000!

186
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:46,933
Meaning you're having a ball daily!

187
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:52,745
That is fine. May the Lord
grant him more prosperity!

188
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,964
But my life is miserable!

189
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,552
So much of running around!

190
00:21:58,928 --> 00:22:03,167
Bank accounts, household expenses,
house rent, groceries...

191
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:06,597
Everything is on my head!

192
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:10,542
- And your daughter-in-law?
- She's one of God's creations!

193
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:14,753
She won't spend a penny
without asking me!

194
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:19,259
If she goes shopping, it's with me!
If she wants to go out, it's with me!

195
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:21,919
You'll be shocked to hear this.

196
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:25,363
Even her Jewelry is of my choice!

197
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:29,357
By the grace of God,
I've got a good daughter-in-law!

198
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:32,314
What else do you need?
Your old age is great!

199
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:38,113
You maybe old! I am still young!

200
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,709
I was passing by the confectioner's
he was frying piping hot sweetmeats.

201
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,628
My mouth watered, so I bought
the whole lot. Everybody start!

202
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,595
- What's in this?
- Just a minute.

203
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,449
This is for my daughter-in-law.

204
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:54,678
Thank you, father.

205
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:57,582
- This is for Ramesh.
- And me?

206
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:58,511
Be patient.

207
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:03,550
This pant piece is for you
And this shirt piece for Sewak.

208
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:04,581
Thank you.

209
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:08,728
And this is for my only wife.

210
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:11,730
At least say thanks.

211
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:14,526
- Where's yours?
- That's a surprise.

212
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:18,475
When I wear it on Diwali,
people will watch agape.

213
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:23,744
Dad, these are great!

214
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:26,237
Let's have tea.

215
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:35,392
- Chander...
- So you'll wear this for Diwali?

216
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:38,653
I wait for your new clothes.
Get something for yourself too.

217
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:43,160
I spend the day in uniform
and night in a night suit.

218
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:47,121
It's their time. They go places.

219
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,371
They are Avtaar Kishen's sons
not some nincompoop's!

220
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:51,405
Mother!

221
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,977
Mother! Dad! I've got a Job!

222
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,138
Congratulations!

223
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:59,077
Congratulations, brother!

224
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,797
- When do you Join?
- On the first.

225
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:09,288
But we'll have to pay 5000 rupees
as security deposit within 2 days.

226
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:12,200
Five thousand rupees!

227
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:15,031
Where will we get so much money?

228
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:21,282
Why do you worry? God is with us.
Everything will work out fine.

229
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:23,815
Everything will work out fine.

230
00:24:28,056 --> 00:24:32,965
Good day! how did you come by today?

231
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:40,618
- I have some work.
- Command your slave.

232
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:43,954
I need 5000 rupees.

233
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:47,684
Ramesh has got a Job.
he has to pay security deposit.

234
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:50,102
- By which date?
- Tomorrow.

235
00:24:50,728 --> 00:24:53,103
Rustom has gone to Ahmedabad.
I'll return it soon as he comes.

236
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:59,376
You're a little late.

237
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,081
By God, 10000 rupees
were lying in the house.

238
00:25:03,381 --> 00:25:06,790
Then Amjadbhai came,
my brother-in-law...

239
00:25:06,894 --> 00:25:09,102
...he needed it so I gave it.

240
00:25:12,295 --> 00:25:13,879
This is very difficult.

241
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:18,884
Look there's only one solution.

242
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:22,087
I'll go to Amjad and
get the money back.

243
00:25:22,248 --> 00:25:25,165
Let him arrange from elsewhere.
But your Job must be done!

244
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:29,095
No way! he's your relative.
Don't worry about me.

245
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:32,939
Lord will make some
arrangements for me.

246
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:37,165
Okay, I'll take leave.

247
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:45,153
At least have tea.

248
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,835
Some other time. Good bye.

249
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:50,253
Oh Lord!

250
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:51,869
Dad!

251
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,601
- What is it daughter-in-law?
- What is this you've picked up?

252
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:00,423
Vegetables that resemble you!
And that mince...!

253
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:04,212
how often have I told you
to get fine mince!

254
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:06,888
The mince is quite fine.

255
00:26:06,977 --> 00:26:09,181
Is that fine? God what a shame!

256
00:26:09,374 --> 00:26:13,970
While eating eye sight is sharp
but weakens when buying groceries!

257
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:20,657
You do one odd Job but ruin 10 others!

258
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:31,056
Where are you going?
One rupee is short in the account.

259
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:35,173
I got some betel leaf
and tobacco for myself.

260
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,307
Lord bless us!
he's got the world's vices!

261
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:42,294
What expenses you pile up!

262
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:46,400
I'm fed up! Your son
is sitting cool in Dubai.

263
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,979
And tied this pain round my neck!

264
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:40,376
I'm so stupid!
I forgot to tell you the good news.

265
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:44,047
- Good news?
- I've got a whole month's leave.

266
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:48,743
Start preparations.
First we'll go to Shimla.

267
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:52,622
Then Red Fort in Delhi, Taj Mahal
in Agra and Charminar in Hyderabad!

268
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,447
I've been watching them from here.

269
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,044
Whenever you need something,
you take me on a tour of India!

270
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,478
What is it?

271
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:03,010
Actually...

272
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:09,142
Give me these bangles.

273
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:13,717
- Bangles?
- Yes, I'll return them in a month.

274
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:16,592
No, I won't give these.

275
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:19,292
- Listen...
- Absolutely not!

276
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:22,493
These are mother's bangles.

277
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,688
Ramesh too is our child.

278
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,556
Silly woman! For whom do I need this?

279
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:31,473
Remember his condition?

280
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:35,578
That little baby was
almost breathing his last.

281
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,446
How terrifying that night was!

282
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:57,344
Doctor.

283
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,392
I am sorry. I can do nothing.

284
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:04,244
No. This can't be true!

285
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:07,673
My baby! You can't leave me!

286
00:29:10,968 --> 00:29:13,148
Do anything but save my child!

287
00:29:13,189 --> 00:29:16,009
If anything happens to him,
I'll never forgive you!

288
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:20,924
What haven't I done?
Consulted doctors, physicians.

289
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:25,228
I went everywhere.
Where do I go now?

290
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:28,665
- Knock at mother's door.
- Mother's door?

291
00:29:28,706 --> 00:29:31,782
Knock at Vaishnodevi's door.

292
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:35,771
Take him to her refuge without
eating or drinking anything.

293
00:29:36,094 --> 00:29:38,682
Nobody returned
disheartened from her temple.

294
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:51,215
"Whom the Goddess invites...

295
00:29:51,256 --> 00:30:00,064
...different are those people."

296
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:08,491
"Whom the Goddess invites...

297
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:15,926
...lucky are those."

298
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:32,310
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

299
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:37,450
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

300
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:42,855
"Let's go, call has come."

301
00:30:42,896 --> 00:30:51,778
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

302
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:53,122
"Glories to the Goddess!"

303
00:30:53,163 --> 00:31:02,514
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

304
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:13,653
"Sitting on high mountains,
the Goddess beckons."

305
00:31:13,694 --> 00:31:22,520
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

306
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,940
"Glories to the Goddess!"

307
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:32,832
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

308
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:50,035
"This is the only place in the world...

309
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:54,234
...where all sorrows are forgotten."

310
00:31:54,278 --> 00:31:56,778
"This is the only place in the world...

311
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:59,990
...where all sorrows are forgotten."

312
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:09,551
"The Goddess is waiting
for her dear ones."

313
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:15,059
"The Goddess is waiting
for her dear ones."

314
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:24,821
"The cool breeze is blowing
carrying her message."

315
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:34,149
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

316
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,261
"Glories to the Goddess!"

317
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:36,488
"Glories to the Goddess!"

318
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:37,876
"Glories to the Goddess!"

319
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:40,431
- "Keep saying...
- Glories to the Goddess!"

320
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:43,015
- "Glories to the Goddess!"
- "Glories to the Goddess!"

321
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:45,514
"Keep saying...
- Glories to the Goddess!"

322
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:50,504
"Keep saying Glories to the Goddess!"

323
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:55,754
"Keep walking and don't see
the blisters on your feet."

324
00:32:55,803 --> 00:33:00,817
"Keep walking and don't see
the blisters on your feet."

325
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:06,168
"The one who has
endured so much pain...

326
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:10,674
...gets that much of happiness too."

327
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:19,449
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

328
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,933
"Glories to the Goddess!"

329
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:46,655
"In Vaishnodevi's temple..."

330
00:33:47,913 --> 00:33:53,680
"In Vaishnodevi's temple..."

331
00:33:54,232 --> 00:34:00,201
"...prayers are answered."

332
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:07,936
"Devotees come in tears but
go back with a smile on their lips."

333
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,923
"Devotees come in tears but
go back with a smile on their lips."

334
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:23,687
"Let me also ask for a boon,
all prayers are answered."

335
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:32,499
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

336
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,981
"Glories to the Goddess!"

337
00:35:03,383 --> 00:35:08,967
"I am also a mother, Goddess."

338
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:13,248
"Only a mother can
recognize another mother."

339
00:35:13,336 --> 00:35:19,030
"I am also a mother, Goddess."

340
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:23,428
"Only a mother can
recognize another mother."

341
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:33,187
"Nobody else can understand
a child's suffering."

342
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:43,343
"How can I see the one in
trouble whom I've given birth to?"

343
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:52,381
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

344
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:03,187
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

345
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:08,174
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

346
00:36:08,215 --> 00:36:12,977
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

347
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:18,359
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

348
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:31,466
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

349
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:33,889
- "With love say...
- Glories to the Goddess!"

350
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,303
- "All of you say...
- Glories to the Goddess!"

351
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:39,053
"Glories to the Goddess!"

352
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,190
- "Queen of mountains.
- Glories to the Goddess."

353
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:43,648
- "Merciful.
- Glories to the Goddess."

354
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:45,881
- "Naïve.
- Glories to the Goddess."

355
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,274

- Glories to the Goddess."

357
00:36:50,774 --> 00:36:52,959
- "Eases the pain.
- Glories to the Goddess."

358
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:55,258
- "Glories to the Goddess."
- "Glories to the Goddess."

359
00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:01,109
- "Glories to the Goddess."
- "Glories to the Goddess."

360
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:07,252
- "Glories to the Goddess."
- "Glories to the Goddess."

361
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:13,280
- "Glories to the Goddess."
- "Glories to the Goddess."

362
00:37:13,382 --> 00:37:18,170
- "Glories to the Goddess."

365
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:32,358
- "Glories to the Goddess."
- "Glories to the Goddess."

366
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,686
Mr. Ramesh, hearty congratulations.

367
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:22,658
- You are appointed.
- Thank you so much, sir.

368
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:27,827
I am confident you will do your
duty with honesty and dedication.

369
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:29,583
I will try my best, sir.

370
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,418
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.

371
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:38,299
Dear friend, my landlord.
here's the rent for this month.

372
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:41,361
The same 80 bucks
for the past 15 years!

373
00:38:41,693 --> 00:38:45,568
Neither can I throw you out of
the house nor from my heart!

374
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,357
Why don't you buy this house?

375
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:51,780
- Buy it?
- Yes.

376
00:38:54,393 --> 00:38:59,638
- Why do you pull my leg?
- No Jokes. I'll sell it dirt cheap.

377
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,773
Give me 30000 and become a landlord.

378
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:04,528
I was born a landlord.

379
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:08,089
The country was divided. Land got
left behind and the lord came here.

380
00:39:11,777 --> 00:39:15,220
Now I have but one desire.
To make Radha a landlady.

381
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:16,618
God willing!

382
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:19,350
The moment I win a lottery,
I'll come over with the cash.

383
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:22,655
Till then my friend,
make do with the rent.

384
00:39:23,438 --> 00:39:25,563
Good day.
Goodbye, sister-in-law!

385
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,248
Whose telegram is it?

386
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:38,996
From him. he is coming.

387
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:41,935
Anwar is coming? When?

388
00:39:42,062 --> 00:39:44,941
- Around Eid.
- Good gracious!

389
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:48,394
I'll see my son after a whole year!

390
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:50,943
First see the condition of the house!

391
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:55,459
What will he say? Stains on the
walls and cobwebs hanging too!

392
00:39:55,658 --> 00:39:58,849
Don't worry. I'll get a labourer.

393
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,638
You want an excuse to splurge!

394
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:05,676
A two room house and
you can't clean it!

395
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:08,326
By God you eat like a horse!

396
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,754
Get a broom not a labourer!

397
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:19,935
Why are you standing? If the mill
closes, you'll have to sleep hungry!

398
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:28,355
As if she feeds me a proper meal!

399
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,630
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

400
00:40:32,671 --> 00:40:35,610
- Hello, father!
- Seeing you after very long.

401
00:40:35,664 --> 00:40:38,166
He's always studying.

402
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:40,941
Brilliant boy! Sit!

403
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:46,482
I've often told you to
introduce us to your family.

404
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,434
In a day or two.

405
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:51,568
You always say this.

406
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:55,347
Scold him hard Dad.

407
00:40:56,344 --> 00:41:00,115
Meeting each other
will strengthen bonds.

408
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:03,652
Now go home and tell your Dad...

409
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:07,921
...that he and his family will
eat dinner with us tomorrow.

410
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:11,490
This is my request and order too!
Understand?

411
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:13,529
Come!

412
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,495
This is my mother.

413
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,531
- Greetings!
- Bless you!

414
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:12,048
That is my Dad.

415
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:19,248
And she is Laxminarayan's
only daughter.

416
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:24,417
- How is sir?
- He is fine.

417
00:42:26,374 --> 00:42:29,688
My Dad told Chander
and Chander told me.

418
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:33,716
And I'm telling you, my Dad has
invited all of you for dinner.

419
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:40,544
Tell Renu to tell her Dad...

420
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:42,547
...Avtaar Kishen said to tell her Dad...

421
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:48,673
...that he will come with his
family for dinner tomorrow night!

422
00:42:52,443 --> 00:42:54,340
- The meal was delicious.
- Sit.

423
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,857
The effort with which you've educated
your sons and made them capable...

424
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:03,505
It's really your courage.

425
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:06,828
You may call it courage.

426
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:12,242
You may call it duty.
But I call it love.

427
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:15,099
I appreciate this love.

428
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:22,045
You've done a lot.
Now let me do something.

429
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:26,146
I want to take over all of
Chandar's responsibilities.

430
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:29,170
His management course.

431
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,028
Training, business.
Leave it all to me.

432
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,623
Assume you're free from his side.

433
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:39,365
I haven't understood.

434
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:43,581
I don't see any difference
between a son and son-in-law.

435
00:43:44,445 --> 00:43:46,568
Renu is my only child.

436
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:52,380
Chander can stay here and look
after my house, business, everything.

437
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:58,310
So you want to make
him a house husband?

438
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:01,146
I want to make his future.

439
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,429
Thank you very much sir.

440
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:09,458
Chander's father is alive as yet.

441
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:11,525
What are you saying?

442
00:44:14,923 --> 00:44:17,287
Avtaar Kishen lives by his own efforts.

443
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:21,853
Your wealth can never
wield power over his poverty.

444
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:27,295
In your false pride,
you're losing a good opportunity.

445
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:29,744
You'll regret it someday.

446
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,388
Sir, it's the needy who regrets!

447
00:44:34,887 --> 00:44:35,818
Avtaar Kishen.

448
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,313
The one you want to buy with wealth,
has this written on his forehead...

449
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,089
'Not for sale.'

450
00:44:42,526 --> 00:44:44,934
Money can buy everything.

451
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,948
But I'll never sell my wealth!

452
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:48,895
Father!

453
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:53,804
Understand one thing clearly.

454
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:56,380
Renu will come to my house
as my daughter-in-law.

455
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:59,185
My son won't stay here
as a house husband!

456
00:45:00,108 --> 00:45:01,090
Goodbye!

457
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:12,326
Yes, I know wealth is great.

458
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:15,779
But relations and feelings that
aren't sold in the market are greater!

459
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,974
Laxminarayan must be thinking
what a man he has encountered!

460
00:45:21,448 --> 00:45:26,060
But you did speak a lot.
In a way you insulted him.

461
00:45:27,807 --> 00:45:28,897
Insult?

462
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:32,075
Whatever it be, he is a big man.

463
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:36,261
A big man is one who
doesn't consider others small.

464
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,302
You're still a child. The fangs
of these wolves are hidden.

465
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:45,678
As regards your love,
look at your mother.

466
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:50,248
Her Dad could buy 10 Laxminarayans!
But she left everything and came to me

467
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:53,974
If Renu's love is true,
she too will come.

468
00:45:57,203 --> 00:46:00,465
Now all that remains is your studies.
Leave that to me.

469
00:46:00,877 --> 00:46:03,146
What is 15000 rupees?

470
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,857
I'll work night and day, slog my
guts out but you'll do the course!

471
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:12,413
First I trust the Lord.
Then this hand of mine!

472
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,287
From where did you get this Junk?

473
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:27,224
From the Junkyard of my destiny!

474
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,529
What will you do with it?

475
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:36,563
I've got Ramesh fixed up with a Job.
Now I'm only worried about Chander.

476
00:46:36,692 --> 00:46:40,197
he wants to do a course
and I will see that it is done!

477
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:44,561
This will be the last test of my life.

478
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:48,744
But son, every bone in this is broken!

479
00:46:49,232 --> 00:46:51,658
I'll fix its' bones with my sweat.

480
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,712
I'll put life into it.
And sell it as brand new.

481
00:46:56,181 --> 00:47:00,369
Just be kind enough to give me
some space in your garage.

482
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,156
I'll do your work during the
day and mine at night.

483
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:06,072
Who has stopped you? Go right ahead!

484
00:48:41,714 --> 00:48:45,487
Take him to the hospital! Fast!

485
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:30,221
My hand!

486
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:35,072
What has happened to my hand?

487
00:49:39,124 --> 00:49:41,845
- Doctor...
- I am sorry...

488
00:49:43,323 --> 00:49:46,237
...this hand will have no sensation.

489
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:47,795
No.

490
00:50:00,481 --> 00:50:03,731
Good God! What has happened!

491
00:50:04,478 --> 00:50:06,362
Who has cast an evil eye on us?

492
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,577
Our own.

493
00:50:09,244 --> 00:50:13,297
I used to work a lot.
Now I've got a break.

494
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,043
Don't cry silly woman.
So what if I've lost an arm?

495
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:21,367
I have two arms left.
Ramesh and Chander!

496
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:24,476
With them around, why should we worry?

497
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,005
Don't cry.

498
00:50:31,005 --> 00:50:32,683
Be brave.

499
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:41,864
This watch is for you.

500
00:50:43,396 --> 00:50:44,416
Perfumes.

501
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,297
- Saris.
- Nothing for my sister?

502
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:50,357
- I've bought 2 saris for her.
- And my brother?

503
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:52,941
This suit length for him.

504
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:54,875
For whom is this?

505
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:58,274
I bought this for Dad.

506
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,304
Good you did that.
he will be pleased.

507
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:04,434
If not you who else
will bring for him?

508
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:07,453
Anwar. Anwar.

509
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:11,312
Where are you son?
have some sweets.

510
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:18,578
I'd asked God to send you.
I'm really relieved you came.

511
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:21,148
After ages, I'm at peace.

512
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:26,265
Found peace? So long
you were sleeping on thorns!

513
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:31,890
Walking on fire! I swear,
complain to your son about me!

514
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:34,570
Tell him I wouldn't feed you!

515
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:37,992
Made you work like a
slave day and night!

516
00:51:38,377 --> 00:51:40,255
- Tell him.
- Yes! Yes!

517
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:44,203
You are right!
You've made me a servant!

518
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:49,820
Since the day you left,
this woman has made my life hell!

519
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:55,687
Both father and son slaughter me!
Let your heart be at peace!

520
00:51:55,914 --> 00:52:00,023
God is witness that I considered
him more than my own Dad!

521
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:02,654
But what did I get in return?

522
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:09,561
What are you watching?
Throw me out by my hair!

523
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:17,150
Dad this poor thing
serves you night and day.

524
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:19,291
And you are maligning her?

525
00:52:20,143 --> 00:52:21,698
It's very sad.

526
00:52:23,538 --> 00:52:25,165
I didn't expect this from you.

527
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:29,513
Come, Zubeida.

528
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:54,730
Rice pudding.

529
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,991
I love it.

530
00:53:30,452 --> 00:53:33,256
- Avtaar Kishen!
- Welcome, sir!

531
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:35,647
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

532
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,528
Greetings!

533
00:53:37,912 --> 00:53:40,506
- How are you?
- Everything is fine.

534
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:46,053
Son, you left the garage
and the life went out of it.

535
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,787
Sir!

536
00:53:49,221 --> 00:53:52,746
People leave the world but
the world still gets by.

537
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:55,850
But how did you come by?

538
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:58,574
Good news for you.

539
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:00,787
Good news.

540
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:05,006
15000 from your provident fund.

541
00:54:05,751 --> 00:54:09,077
You met with an accident
during working hours.

542
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:13,716
Compensation for that 20000.
And your Junk car...

543
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:19,795
...that you repaired and dressed up
I even sold that for 20000.

544
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:28,623
- Really?
- That accounts for 55000.

545
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:31,788
Mr. Mehta, give him the money. Take it.

546
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:39,455
- Is this all mine?
- Yes, yours.

547
00:54:55,925 --> 00:55:02,334
Mother, I may forget you but
you don't forget me for a moment.

548
00:55:03,572 --> 00:55:05,761
You made all my dreams
come true in one flash!

549
00:55:06,668 --> 00:55:08,528
You've made me so rich...

550
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:10,736
..that there's no worry of the future!

551
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,897
Didn't I say I would see
that you did the course?

552
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,248
Take this and catch hold
of Khan uncle today itself.

553
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:27,129
And get the papers made for the house.

554
00:55:27,896 --> 00:55:34,748
The house should be registered
in your mother's name, not mine.

555
00:55:37,995 --> 00:55:42,848
Congratulations!

556
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,614
Today you have become a landlady!

557
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:52,170
I won't let this Joy go unnoticed.

558
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:55,148
I'll celebrate it grandly!

559
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:17,350
"Lord..."

560
00:56:17,635 --> 00:56:19,870
"Lord..."

561
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:21,896
"Lord..."

562
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,196
"Lord..."

563
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:29,541
"Lord, you are too good!"

564
00:56:29,656 --> 00:56:34,292
"Lord, you are too good!"

565
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:39,026
"You keep giving!"

566
00:56:39,392 --> 00:56:43,909
"Lord, you are too good!"

567
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:48,070
"You keep giving!"

568
00:56:48,111 --> 00:56:53,174
"Your benevolence is endless."

569
00:56:53,215 --> 00:56:57,417
"Lord, you are too good!"

570
00:56:57,743 --> 00:57:01,628
"You keep giving!"

571
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:04,024
"O Lord..."

572
00:57:08,678 --> 00:57:11,085
"O Lord..."

573
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:39,597
"You gave me such a loving wife
and such a wonderful family."

574
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:43,831
"You gave me such a loving wife
and such a wonderful family."

575
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:48,182
"You are happy under
all circumstances."

576
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:51,620
"And are smiling like
the flowing waters."

577
00:57:53,118 --> 00:58:02,372
"Not you or you,
it's me who is the father of two sons."

578
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,253
"That is my greatest wealth."

579
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:11,317
"Lord, you are too good!"

580
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:15,651
"You keep giving!"

581
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,714
"O Lord..."

582
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:45,160
"If you take away something...

583
00:58:45,938 --> 00:58:49,138
...you compensate for it
in a thousand other ways."

584
00:58:50,643 --> 00:58:53,000
"If you take away something...

585
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:55,307
...you compensate for it
in a thousand other ways."

586
00:58:55,348 --> 00:59:00,522
"I had so many dreams.
You have been very kind to me."

587
00:59:01,896 --> 00:59:06,189
"Some people crib for shoes."

588
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:10,829
"Some people crib for shoes."

589
00:59:11,045 --> 00:59:15,853
"But there are some
who don't even have feet."

590
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:20,782
"I'm not in such a pitiable condition."

591
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:25,181
"Lord, you are too good!"

592
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,156
"You keep giving!"

593
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:31,528
"O Lord..."

594
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:08,110
"What can I say about your glory..."

595
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:11,993
"...you've given me so much money
in my bad days?"

596
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:14,877
"What can I say about your glory..."

597
01:00:14,918 --> 01:00:17,184
"...you've given me so
much money in my bad days?"

598
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:22,669
"You gave me encouragement
and the fruits of my labour."

599
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:27,627
"Good and bad days are
the two sides of a coin."

600
01:00:27,868 --> 01:00:32,532
"Good and bad days are
the two sides of a coin."

601
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:37,282
"In a garden of blooms..."

602
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:42,391
....there are thorns
also along with roses."

603
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,665
"Lord, you are too good!"

604
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:50,573
"You keep giving!"

605
01:00:50,703 --> 01:00:55,941
"Your benevolence is endless."

606
01:00:55,982 --> 01:01:00,027
"Lord, you are too good!"

607
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:03,988
"You keep giving!"

608
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:06,781
"O Lord..."

609
01:01:10,649 --> 01:01:13,406
"O Lord..."

610
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,123
Come on.

611
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:42,657
Okay kids begin.

612
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:59,758
"Let's go, the Goddess' call has come."

613
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,299
How time flies.

614
01:02:04,465 --> 01:02:07,093
We took Ramesh when he was tiny
to the Mother Goddess' temple.

615
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,249
And today he is 25 years old.

616
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,523
But you didn't let me
fulfil my promise.

617
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:16,832
You were involved in
your own running around.

618
01:02:16,971 --> 01:02:20,952
Now there's no running around,
Just time to while away.

619
01:02:21,773 --> 01:02:23,273
We can leave whenever you wish.

620
01:02:24,171 --> 01:02:25,714
- Ramesh.
- Yes, father?

621
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:33,773
On this Ashtami day, your mother
wishes to go on a pilgrimage.

622
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:38,007
Looks like Mother has called her.

623
01:02:38,776 --> 01:02:42,812
Today is Saturday. Get 2 tickets
of the Super fast for Monday.

624
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:43,949
Okay, father!

625
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:47,413
"Glories to the Goddess!"

626
01:02:47,454 --> 01:02:50,962
"Let's go, call has come."

627
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:56,702
Despite what you say,
I won't give you a penny.

628
01:02:57,737 --> 01:03:01,429
If they are fond of loafing,
let them arrange it themselves.

629
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:09,054
Ramesh, how is this set?
It has Just come today.

630
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:11,945
It is beautiful.

631
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,507
Keep this coat for sir.
It will be very cold there.

632
01:03:23,476 --> 01:03:26,156
You are always worried about him.

633
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:30,662
Ramesh...

634
01:03:35,487 --> 01:03:37,570
What time is the train?

635
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,195
- I ...
- What is it?

636
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:44,749
- I couldn't get the tickets.
- Why?

637
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:51,606
I couldn't arrange money.

638
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:53,589
You couldn't arrange for the money?

639
01:03:54,185 --> 01:03:56,634
Yes mother I tried a lot.

640
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:59,796
I asked the bank for advance
but I didn't get it.

641
01:03:59,898 --> 01:04:02,604
We didn't want thousands!

642
01:04:03,114 --> 01:04:08,554
You know Chander is studying.
Dad too is out of work.

643
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:13,202
The house is running only on my salary.

644
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:20,991
Why don't you go on the
pilgrimage next year?

645
01:04:22,161 --> 01:04:24,047
By then I'll arrange something.

646
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:36,296
He is right. We'll go next year.

647
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:43,281
No. Once you've thought about it
you must definitely go.

648
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:49,960
By the grace of your kindness, I've
saved some money in the post office.

649
01:04:50,742 --> 01:04:53,752
Rupees 500. I'll get that.

650
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,498
Sewak.

651
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:03,054
My child! You're offering this...
Our pilgrimage has been successful.

652
01:05:03,992 --> 01:05:07,273
- Mistress!
- My child!

653
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:15,288
- Hello!
- Hello, Mr. Rashid!

654
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:18,359
- Hello Uncle!
- Bless you, son!

655
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,775
- All fine?
- Absolutely.

656
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:22,746
Uncle...

657
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:29,234
If you could open a little account
with 10000 rupees in my bank...

658
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:33,632
Why didn't you say so earlier?
Anyway no problem. It will be done.

659
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:36,163
I don't need to take permission.

660
01:05:36,243 --> 01:05:38,452
- Thank you! Bye.
- Bye.

661
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,726
- Is the betel leaf ready?
- Sure but I won't give it.

662
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:47,232
All right. Let's hear it.

663
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:52,976
Who belongs to whom?
It's all fate.

664
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:58,702
When a dear one thinks of us,
a pain is close to the heart.

665
01:05:58,749 --> 01:06:01,030
Amazing!

666
01:06:01,171 --> 01:06:03,287
This reminds me of one.
Goes like this...

667
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:04,436
Yes, please.

668
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:08,320
What does beauty know?
What does love understand?

669
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:12,890
What does beauty know?
What does love understand?

670
01:06:13,008 --> 01:06:15,845
The world lies at the feet
of us who lick the dust!

671
01:06:15,925 --> 01:06:20,508
- Beautifully spoken!
- Thank you.

672
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:25,918
- Goodbye!
- See you!

673
01:06:29,274 --> 01:06:33,543
- Radha, where are you?
- What's wrong? I'm here.

674
01:06:34,502 --> 01:06:37,251
What Joy is it that
you can't even see me?

675
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:40,507
- Chander has got through!
- Chander got through!

676
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:42,966
After all whose son is he?

677
01:06:43,136 --> 01:06:44,319
Radha-Kishen's!

678
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:47,608
But where is he?

679
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:51,195
Daddy! Daddy!

680
01:06:51,236 --> 01:06:53,423
By the grace of your blessings
I have got through!

681
01:06:55,273 --> 01:06:58,702
This is no great news for me.

682
01:06:59,397 --> 01:07:01,432
This is the beginning of your success.

683
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:06,359
It's my heartfelt desire to send
you to America for higher studies.

684
01:07:09,782 --> 01:07:10,888
America!

685
01:07:11,623 --> 01:07:14,248
But you won't go alone.

686
01:07:15,544 --> 01:07:17,091
Renu will go with you.

687
01:07:20,952 --> 01:07:23,417
Every Joy of life will be at your feet.

688
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:27,519
Studies and honeymoon,
both together.

689
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:35,214
I can never forget your obligations.

690
01:07:36,889 --> 01:07:41,257
Young man, one has to lose
something in order to gain something.

691
01:07:41,726 --> 01:07:42,788
What?

692
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:47,819
The need of today has reduced
the importance of relations.

693
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,042
Nobody thinks about anybody else.

694
01:07:51,503 --> 01:07:53,686
Man has to think for himself.

695
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:56,503
I haven't understood.

696
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:06,444
It's plain and simple. On one hand
you have status, position, future.

697
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,897
And on the other side is your family.

698
01:08:12,257 --> 01:08:14,956
You can choose whichever one you want.

699
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,865
The choice is yours.

700
01:08:28,054 --> 01:08:33,079
What? You will leave home?

701
01:08:33,302 --> 01:08:36,171
Mother every man has the right
to think for himself.

702
01:08:36,257 --> 01:08:39,063
What is wrong if I think for myself?

703
01:08:39,266 --> 01:08:41,108
I'm making my future.

704
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:46,350
But... you are our future, son.

705
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,866
We raised you with our blood and sweat

706
01:08:49,122 --> 01:08:51,593
Made you capable enough
to be noticed by others.

707
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:54,975
And you will leave us?

708
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:58,112
Is this how you repay your
Dad for his sacrifices?

709
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,764
Sacrifices?
What have you done for me?

710
01:09:02,131 --> 01:09:06,272
Educated me? Paid my school
and college fees?

711
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:09,163
This is the duty of every parent!

712
01:09:09,374 --> 01:09:12,021
That is what you have done
What else have you done?

713
01:09:13,169 --> 01:09:14,460
What are you saying?

714
01:09:14,593 --> 01:09:16,113
I am right, mother.

715
01:09:16,675 --> 01:09:19,811
What do you want?
Should I let this opportunity go?

716
01:09:20,168 --> 01:09:25,147
Don't weigh your parents'
love with wealth son.

717
01:09:25,188 --> 01:09:28,944
Love! Wealth is even bigger.

718
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:33,077
You left everything and came here.

719
01:09:33,308 --> 01:09:36,514
What did you get in return?
Stove, grinding stone, smoke!

720
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,421
Your hair has turned gray
doing the dishes!

721
01:09:39,564 --> 01:09:42,171
You spent your whole life
in Just 2 pairs of clothes!

722
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:45,577
- Shut up!
- No, Radha.

723
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:47,667
No, Radha.

724
01:09:51,235 --> 01:09:52,849
He is right.

725
01:09:54,968 --> 01:09:57,030
What have we done?

726
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:05,350
We have done what every
parent does for their children.

727
01:10:06,353 --> 01:10:08,679
Chander! Chander!

728
01:10:13,152 --> 01:10:14,337
Radha!

729
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,502
Radha!

730
01:10:15,857 --> 01:10:16,857
Radha!

731
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:19,002
Radha!

732
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,391
Radha!

733
01:10:35,593 --> 01:10:37,314
Mr. Avtaar Kishen?

734
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:42,987
A father has come to your door
as a beggar not Avtaar Kishen.

735
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:45,011
What are you saying?

736
01:10:45,663 --> 01:10:49,011
You seem somewhat upset.

737
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:52,839
Tell me how I can help you.

738
01:10:53,397 --> 01:10:57,519
Have mercy on this poor man
and give my son back to me.

739
01:10:57,861 --> 01:11:01,370
Say whatever you have to Chander.

740
01:11:02,096 --> 01:11:03,925
I don't want to come
between father and son.

741
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:06,714
You are already between us.

742
01:11:07,338 --> 01:11:11,253
I'm not one of those rich men
whose wealth lies in banks and lockers

743
01:11:11,877 --> 01:11:14,891
My wealth is my children.

744
01:11:15,251 --> 01:11:17,246
You locked that up in your vault.

745
01:11:17,326 --> 01:11:18,465
Avtaar Kishen!

746
01:11:18,617 --> 01:11:22,348
I faced mountains of difficulties
but never lost courage.

747
01:11:23,308 --> 01:11:26,449
But today the sorrow of
a child broke my back!

748
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:31,988
I suffered, lived in abject misery
but I never stretched out my hand!

749
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,344
Today I put out my hand before you.

750
01:11:36,721 --> 01:11:39,488
Put my earnings of 22 years
in my lap as charity!

751
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:42,012
I'll be eternally obliged.

752
01:11:42,263 --> 01:11:46,956
Don't accuse me unjustly.
I haven't tied up your son.

753
01:11:47,525 --> 01:11:53,362
You've come here of your own will.
I haven't forced you.

754
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:55,824
You may leave with
your Dad if you wish!

755
01:11:59,132 --> 01:12:02,175
Come home son. I've come to take you.

756
01:12:02,216 --> 01:12:04,633
I won't go back to that hell!

757
01:12:05,658 --> 01:12:08,667
Have pity for your mother, if not me.

758
01:12:08,965 --> 01:12:11,012
Come and see how she pines for you.

759
01:12:11,053 --> 01:12:14,191
For me both my parents are dead!

760
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:25,974
No.

761
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:11,980
Ramesh has closed your account.

762
01:13:15,294 --> 01:13:18,964
He said if I give you cigarette...

763
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:21,902
...I must take the money from you.

764
01:14:19,137 --> 01:14:23,262
You went out and the
mistress fell very ill.

765
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,346
- What happened?
- She fainted all of a sudden.

766
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:32,081
I called the doctor.
He gave an injection. Now she's better.

767
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:34,766
Radha...

768
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:40,175
- Now how are you?
- Did you go for the wedding?

769
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:44,474
Yes, I did.

770
01:14:48,274 --> 01:14:51,581
Why didn't you come for the wedding?
Everybody was waiting for you.

771
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:02,003
Mr. Laxminarayan has sent
these for both of you.

772
01:15:04,622 --> 01:15:06,101
Sewak!

773
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:09,162
What happened?

774
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:14,386
Who broke the lock to my room?

775
01:15:15,723 --> 01:15:18,437
- I broke it.
- Why?

776
01:15:18,699 --> 01:15:22,003
The mistress suddenly fell ill.
Nobody else was at home.

777
01:15:22,629 --> 01:15:26,482
- There was no money at home...
- So you broke the lock for money?

778
01:15:26,665 --> 01:15:29,215
You worthless boy! how dare you!

779
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:31,527
You have pampered him too much!

780
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,816
Today he stole money.
Tomorrow he may steal ornaments!

781
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:37,652
He has not stolen anything.

782
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:40,363
What is breaking a lock
to take money if not theft?

783
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:45,285
I have taken 50 rupees of yours.

784
01:15:45,868 --> 01:15:47,902
I'll take it out from my savings
and replace it by morning.

785
01:15:48,668 --> 01:15:51,252
Stay in your place, rascal!

786
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,462
Why did you stop? Hit me!

787
01:15:57,655 --> 01:16:01,980
He lifted his hand on his
daughter-in-law for a servant!

788
01:16:02,344 --> 01:16:05,808
- Is this the respect we get?
- Please forgive Sewak.

789
01:16:06,064 --> 01:16:09,081
Whatever he did was for me.

790
01:16:09,723 --> 01:16:13,089
As if you were so sick?
We were on our way.

791
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,244
You wouldn't have died in that time!

792
01:16:24,422 --> 01:16:25,550
Ramesh...

793
01:16:28,332 --> 01:16:32,847
Once the peace of the house
is lost, it will only worsen.

794
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:40,644
Now you earn your living so make
arrangements to live elsewhere.

795
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,107
Why?

796
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:48,074
I want you as well as us
to live in peace.

797
01:16:49,736 --> 01:16:53,535
That is why vacate this
house as soon as possible.

798
01:16:53,726 --> 01:16:57,753
Vacate the house?
Who are you to throw us out?

799
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:03,464
The owner of this house!

800
01:17:03,973 --> 01:17:06,973
I am the owner of this house not you!

801
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:11,628
What is she saying?

802
01:17:12,537 --> 01:17:18,051
Father, I got the house registered...

803
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:20,800
...in her name not mother's.

804
01:17:29,934 --> 01:17:32,601
Well done son!

805
01:17:33,703 --> 01:17:35,684
You've done very well.

806
01:17:36,937 --> 01:17:42,535
One son stabbed in the chest
the other in the back!

807
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:52,980
How does it matter
whose name the house is in?

808
01:17:53,462 --> 01:17:55,995
You can stay here as long as you wish.

809
01:17:57,980 --> 01:18:02,206
I don't want to die before my death!

810
01:18:02,585 --> 01:18:06,062
In fact I want to
live even after I die!

811
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,619
Let's go Radha.

812
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:15,221
Let's go.

813
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:25,855
I only have 500 rupees now.

814
01:18:26,227 --> 01:18:30,152
I swear by God I'll pay the
remaining 200 very soon.

815
01:18:30,193 --> 01:18:32,761
Do you think sir is running a charity?

816
01:18:32,965 --> 01:18:35,714
First bring the full amount
Then you'll get the key to the room

817
01:18:37,668 --> 01:18:43,089
Sir, my parents have
no roof over their head.

818
01:18:44,056 --> 01:18:45,574
Have mercy on me.

819
01:18:47,494 --> 01:18:50,089
Give him the key.

820
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:56,136
Thank you very much sir.

821
01:18:56,395 --> 01:19:00,566
I can never forget your obligation.

822
01:19:35,629 --> 01:19:37,136
What are you thinking of?

823
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:41,886
What is left to think about?

824
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:46,441
I don't understand what will happen

825
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:51,097
So what if our kids deceived us..

826
01:19:51,944 --> 01:19:54,081
My experience will never let me down.

827
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:58,144
I am a skilled worker.
Once I get the tools...

828
01:19:58,939 --> 01:20:01,178
I will write my own destiny.

829
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:04,769
But where will you get the tools?

830
01:20:06,087 --> 01:20:07,659
That's what I'm thinking of.

831
01:20:14,029 --> 01:20:16,779
No! No Radha!

832
01:20:18,102 --> 01:20:21,644
I'm already indebted to you.

833
01:20:22,832 --> 01:20:24,710
These things come handy in bad times.

834
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:29,128
A woman's bad time starts
when her husband is no more.

835
01:20:29,307 --> 01:20:32,033
I am alive!

836
01:20:32,612 --> 01:20:35,072
I'm alive. Don't you worry.

837
01:20:35,737 --> 01:20:39,181
Everything will be fine.

838
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:41,017
Everything will be fine.

839
01:21:39,957 --> 01:21:41,039
Next.

840
01:21:41,326 --> 01:21:42,545
Your name?

841
01:21:43,067 --> 01:21:44,234
Bahadur Singh.

842
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,641
Got in the line again!

843
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:49,709
No, I've Just come.

844
01:21:50,148 --> 01:21:52,660
You've already donated once
and you say you've Just come!

845
01:21:53,085 --> 01:21:54,633
Throw him out!

846
01:21:56,099 --> 01:21:58,831
What's the matter?
Why are you beating him?

847
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:04,222
For them selling blood is business!
he drinks and gambles with the money!

848
01:22:05,845 --> 01:22:10,574
What's this child?

849
01:22:11,808 --> 01:22:15,120
Sir, I...

850
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,790
Sir!

851
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:22,292
See what I've brought!

852
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:46,944
Sewak...

853
01:22:47,916 --> 01:22:49,574
Where did you get these from?

854
01:22:49,977 --> 01:22:51,905
I...

855
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:56,674
Did you steal?

856
01:22:56,757 --> 01:23:00,805
- No, I didn't steal.
- Then where did you get money?

857
01:23:02,984 --> 01:23:04,686
I asked where did you get the money?

858
01:23:05,738 --> 01:23:07,502
I met Chander.

859
01:23:08,044 --> 01:23:09,298
Sewak!

860
01:23:11,309 --> 01:23:13,870
You've begged that rascal,
Chander for charity!

861
01:23:14,418 --> 01:23:16,497
Get out of my sight!

862
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:18,750
No Avtaar!

863
01:23:19,516 --> 01:23:22,668
He didn't ask Chander for money.
He is lying.

864
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:26,433
Look at this! And this!

865
01:23:27,446 --> 01:23:31,980
Not once, this poor boy sold
his blood twice to buy these!

866
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:58,053
Forgive me.

867
01:23:59,058 --> 01:24:01,541
Forgive me my son.

868
01:24:04,725 --> 01:24:05,860
Sewak!

869
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:26,026
Why didn't you take
birth from my womb?

870
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:28,546
- Mistress!
- Sewak.

871
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:31,395
"Life is to be enjoyed."

872
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:39,033
"Life means youthfulness."

873
01:25:39,248 --> 01:25:42,496
"A drink, a message."

874
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:45,112
"Life..."

875
01:25:57,271 --> 01:26:04,008
"Life is to be enjoyed."

876
01:26:04,572 --> 01:26:10,790
"Life means youthfulness."

877
01:26:11,537 --> 01:26:14,829
"A drink, a message."

878
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:18,319
"Life..."

879
01:26:18,702 --> 01:26:27,655
"No, life means hard work."

880
01:26:27,842 --> 01:26:36,784
"Time is short and
there is lot's to do."

881
01:26:36,907 --> 01:26:45,321
"Time is short and
there is lot's to do."

882
01:26:45,362 --> 01:26:49,055
"Life..."

883
01:27:20,548 --> 01:27:28,688
"All the joys are within my reach."

884
01:27:32,204 --> 01:27:39,157
"All the joys are within my reach."

885
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:45,853
"Sorrow is a far fetched thing."

886
01:27:46,381 --> 01:27:49,613
"A drink, a message."

887
01:27:49,654 --> 01:27:53,151
"Life..."

888
01:27:53,873 --> 01:28:02,319
"What tradition is this
in the norms of society?"

889
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:11,389
"The tree bears the heat of
the sun and people enjoy its shade."

890
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:20,132
"The tree bears the heat of
the sun and people enjoy its shade."

891
01:28:20,373 --> 01:28:24,037
"Life..."

892
01:28:57,857 --> 01:29:05,663
"I feel like showering my love for you
and giving my life for you."

893
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:15,985
"I feel like showering my love for you
and giving my life for you."

894
01:29:16,031 --> 01:29:23,079
"Life is to sacrifice it for others."

895
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,315
"A drink, a message."

896
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,112
"Life..."

897
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:39,613
"Man dies and takes birth
for thousand times."

898
01:29:39,685 --> 01:29:48,696
"Man dies and takes birth
for thousand times."

899
01:29:48,824 --> 01:29:57,562
"But only the brave and
courageous survive."

900
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:05,829
"But only the brave and
courageous survive."

901
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:10,181
"Life..."

902
01:30:45,689 --> 01:30:49,150
I enjoyed it. The food was great!

903
01:30:49,338 --> 01:30:53,816
We didn't get such food abroad.
Our country is our own after all!

904
01:31:13,496 --> 01:31:14,665
Okay, we'll take leave.

905
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,445
- Okay! Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

906
01:31:48,215 --> 01:31:49,509
Hello, father!

907
01:31:51,267 --> 01:31:54,900
Dad, I've been searching for you.
Finally I found you today.

908
01:31:56,598 --> 01:32:00,442
Why all this? For what?

909
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:08,939
Mother, why does Dad need
to work when we are here?

910
01:32:09,853 --> 01:32:14,556
You'll stay in a hut when we are alive!
I can't tolerate this!

911
01:32:14,773 --> 01:32:20,385
Instead say, you can't bear to see
this hut near your friends' palace?

912
01:32:20,563 --> 01:32:24,689
And you can't bear to see a crippled
man in the hut because he's your Dad!

913
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:27,611
A dirty stain on the
pristine sheet of your honour!

914
01:32:27,735 --> 01:32:30,189
- What are you saying?
- The truth!

915
01:32:30,675 --> 01:32:33,400
You're scared to see us.
What will people say?

916
01:32:33,853 --> 01:32:38,025
Mr. Laxminarayan's son-in-law
is the son of this shabby man?

917
01:32:38,362 --> 01:32:41,248
Who is sitting on the footpath
with a screw driver and plier!

918
01:32:41,776 --> 01:32:44,392
That's not right Dad.

919
01:32:44,442 --> 01:32:48,853
It is! Take your fraud
face away from here!

920
01:32:49,127 --> 01:32:51,775
I've seen its' ugliness. Go away!

921
01:34:26,705 --> 01:34:30,001
- 50 rupees, please.
- What?

922
01:34:30,156 --> 01:34:33,266
I've stopped working for free!

923
01:35:17,017 --> 01:35:19,930
Radha! Sewak!

924
01:35:19,971 --> 01:35:22,138
I've reached my aim!

925
01:35:22,179 --> 01:35:24,385
I've achieved what I wanted!

926
01:35:24,827 --> 01:35:27,811
I've achieved what I wanted!

927
01:35:32,304 --> 01:35:34,275
By inventing this new carburetor...

928
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:39,563
Avtaar has solved the petrol
problem to quite an extent.

929
01:35:40,057 --> 01:35:45,355
A car that ran 10 kilometers
on 1 liter of petrol...

930
01:35:45,644 --> 01:35:49,264
... runs for 15 kilometers
with this new carburetor.

931
01:35:50,455 --> 01:35:51,468
It is a great achievement.

932
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:55,633
Congratulating you on this invention..

933
01:35:56,064 --> 01:36:00,549
We approve of your carburetor.
And recommend it for registration.

934
01:36:02,112 --> 01:36:04,503
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.

935
01:38:04,039 --> 01:38:05,181
Radha.

936
01:38:25,953 --> 01:38:27,405
Wishes on our wedding anniversary.

937
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,098
You too.

938
01:38:31,328 --> 01:38:36,491
I'm very happy to see happiness
on your face after years.

939
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:41,570
The greatest happiness is...

940
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:47,530
...with every passing year,
our love too is growing old.

941
01:38:48,895 --> 01:38:52,898
See what I've brought for you.

942
01:39:06,385 --> 01:39:09,890
Bangles! My gold bangles!

943
01:39:12,494 --> 01:39:16,494
I thought there would be
diamonds and pearls in this.

944
01:39:17,406 --> 01:39:23,788
But I never imagined you would
give me such a precious gift!

945
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:26,866
Time had stolen this.

946
01:39:28,306 --> 01:39:30,288
Today I stole it back from time!

947
01:39:31,557 --> 01:39:34,530
Silly woman! This is your principal.

948
01:39:35,717 --> 01:39:37,714
I have to pay the interest.

949
01:39:40,588 --> 01:39:47,241
On every curve in life,
you have given me something.

950
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:50,069
You never asked for anything.

951
01:39:51,354 --> 01:39:53,067
The need never arose.

952
01:39:54,366 --> 01:39:56,343
When the time comes, I'll ask.

953
01:39:57,598 --> 01:40:00,905
I'll wait for that time.

954
01:40:01,769 --> 01:40:04,890
But now dinner is waiting for you.

955
01:40:09,476 --> 01:40:10,938
Sewak.
- Yes?

956
01:40:11,335 --> 01:40:13,585
Is the order for Universal
Trading Company ready?

957
01:40:14,194 --> 01:40:17,999
They are working double shift.
It will be completed in 2 days.

958
01:40:19,429 --> 01:40:21,851
And what about the
complain about the radiator?

959
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,749
We've asked for the damaged
ones to be sent back.

960
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:27,102
And we've replaced them with new ones.

961
01:40:27,214 --> 01:40:30,905
At least eat dinner in peace.

962
01:40:31,195 --> 01:40:33,067
I am eating peacefully.

963
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:35,211
Sewak, what about Mr. Kapoor's...

964
01:40:35,252 --> 01:40:41,017
That's enough. God has given us
much more than we had desired.

965
01:40:41,434 --> 01:40:42,917
Now take it easy.

966
01:40:45,618 --> 01:40:48,942
Even the government retires men at 55.

967
01:40:50,813 --> 01:40:55,468
Man should retire the day
his call comes from above.

968
01:41:15,503 --> 01:41:16,908
Beautiful, Sudha.

969
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:18,782
Your taste is exquisite.

970
01:41:19,619 --> 01:41:22,456
You've decorated the house so well
it can't be recognised.

971
01:41:22,497 --> 01:41:25,544
Now we need 2 things.
A video and a car.

972
01:41:25,758 --> 01:41:28,015
They too will come.

973
01:41:28,282 --> 01:41:30,949
- Sir dinner is laid.
- Come on.

974
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,235
Please come.

975
01:41:40,190 --> 01:41:42,155
- Take a seat.
- Come.

976
01:41:52,235 --> 01:41:54,449
Take. Start eating!

977
01:41:55,087 --> 01:41:56,460
Mr. Ramesh.

978
01:41:58,047 --> 01:41:59,268
Excuse me.

979
01:42:04,889 --> 01:42:05,953
Welcome.

980
01:42:07,084 --> 01:42:08,962
What happened to our installment?

981
01:42:09,192 --> 01:42:11,745
It will come to you this month.

982
01:42:12,045 --> 01:42:13,644
Every month you put
me off with promises.

983
01:42:13,685 --> 01:42:16,722
And use our refrigerator,
television and furniture.

984
01:42:16,957 --> 01:42:22,581
- This is not right.
- We had some unforeseen expenses.

985
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:24,738
I don't like to repeat myself.

986
01:42:24,969 --> 01:42:28,191
You are the son of a wealthy man.
It doesn't speak well of you.

987
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:30,485
Don't worry, Mr. Taneja.

988
01:42:30,991 --> 01:42:33,488
You won't have reason
to complain henceforth.

989
01:42:34,165 --> 01:42:35,030
Okay!

990
01:42:35,933 --> 01:42:37,683
Dinner is turning cold.

991
01:42:42,362 --> 01:42:44,439
Sir Gopal has come.

992
01:42:54,866 --> 01:42:55,900
Greetings, sir!

993
01:42:59,368 --> 01:43:00,371
Gopal...

994
01:43:01,558 --> 01:43:05,290
I am sorry that you lost a leg
while working in my factory.

995
01:43:07,664 --> 01:43:11,814
If one part is damaged,
the entire machinery is ruined.

996
01:43:13,189 --> 01:43:19,482
I've experienced this.
And so I can sympathise with you.

997
01:43:19,569 --> 01:43:23,384
That you say this is enough for me.

998
01:43:24,182 --> 01:43:30,095
You will get your dues
from the company.

999
01:43:30,902 --> 01:43:32,530
From my side...

1000
01:43:33,998 --> 01:43:35,501
I give you 30000.

1001
01:43:36,508 --> 01:43:38,133
Thirty thousand!

1002
01:43:39,488 --> 01:43:40,923
Are these mine master?

1003
01:43:42,557 --> 01:43:48,103
Did you see children
how generous my master is?

1004
01:43:48,747 --> 01:43:53,876
What a generous heart he has!
he has made a cripple man wealthy!

1005
01:43:55,286 --> 01:43:59,564
This money will be useful in bad times

1006
01:44:00,844 --> 01:44:02,511
Keep them carefully.

1007
01:44:03,014 --> 01:44:08,049
No Gopal! Don't make this mistake!

1008
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,375
Don't ruin your life yourself!

1009
01:44:12,353 --> 01:44:14,785
This world is very cruel, unmerciful!

1010
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:17,514
They will cut off your other leg too!

1011
01:44:18,076 --> 01:44:23,079
This crutch is more dependable
compared to blood relations!

1012
01:44:29,275 --> 01:44:30,780
Sorry Gopal.

1013
01:44:32,568 --> 01:44:36,993
I have no right to interfere
in your personal matters.

1014
01:44:38,946 --> 01:44:40,056
Forgive me.

1015
01:45:07,603 --> 01:45:09,071
I want it done at once.

1016
01:45:09,112 --> 01:45:12,232
But sir our products are
much more superior to theirs.

1017
01:45:12,742 --> 01:45:16,439
Why do we need to sell them cheap?
We will suffer losses.

1018
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:20,259
Sharma...

1019
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:25,808
What you consider a loss,
is the biggest profit of my life.

1020
01:45:27,425 --> 01:45:31,415
Wipe out Laxmi Enterprise and
Chander International from the market

1021
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:34,778
At whatever cost!

1022
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:47,220
Yes, daddy.

1023
01:45:48,598 --> 01:45:51,712
Why are our orders getting cancelled?

1024
01:45:52,534 --> 01:45:54,900
Ball-bearings,
pistol-rings, clutch plates.

1025
01:45:55,296 --> 01:45:58,165
They were in demand till yesterday
Why aren't they being sold today?

1026
01:45:58,762 --> 01:45:59,759
That...

1027
01:46:01,337 --> 01:46:02,193
What's the matter?

1028
01:46:02,994 --> 01:46:08,509
Our competitor, Avtaar Enterprises
is selling its' products very low.

1029
01:46:21,008 --> 01:46:25,609
"Kashi, Kolkatta and Patna rock."

1030
01:46:25,650 --> 01:46:29,414
"When you dance,
the whole world rocks."

1031
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:48,176
- Good day sir!
- Don't abuse our friendship.

1032
01:46:49,158 --> 01:46:51,398
One doesn't make fun of friends.

1033
01:46:59,558 --> 01:47:02,031
Not this, my brand.

1034
01:47:10,503 --> 01:47:11,796
Write it in my account.

1035
01:47:12,947 --> 01:47:15,726
You are great.
You haven't changed one bit.

1036
01:47:18,876 --> 01:47:20,875
We always talked about you.

1037
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,767
Neither have I forgotten.

1038
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:29,062
I missed you badly today.
So I came to meet you.

1039
01:47:50,109 --> 01:47:54,161
- What are you doing?
- Washing grandpa's clothes.

1040
01:47:54,247 --> 01:47:58,239
- Grandpa's clothes?
- Yes, he is unwell.

1041
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:01,578
So what if he's unwell?
You'll wash his dirt? Get up!

1042
01:48:01,846 --> 01:48:04,257
Stupid! You're washing
his dirty clothes!

1043
01:48:04,624 --> 01:48:08,195
But you make him
wash your dirty clothes.

1044
01:48:14,177 --> 01:48:15,403
Shameless!

1045
01:48:23,617 --> 01:48:27,242
Daughter-in-law, aren't you
ashamed to hit the child?

1046
01:48:27,533 --> 01:48:31,992
You should be ashamed!
You made him wash your dirt!

1047
01:48:32,084 --> 01:48:34,445
Tomorrow you'll make
him beg and steal!

1048
01:48:34,671 --> 01:48:38,867
I won't let his horrible
shadow fall on my child!

1049
01:48:39,073 --> 01:48:43,336
I swear by God, either I will
stay in this house or him!

1050
01:48:43,662 --> 01:48:45,450
Come inside!

1051
01:48:50,002 --> 01:48:52,648
Dad, this is too much!

1052
01:48:53,062 --> 01:48:58,828
Let us live in peace.
For God's sake go somewhere else...

1053
01:48:58,877 --> 01:48:59,814
Anwar...

1054
01:49:00,663 --> 01:49:02,156
Where can I go son?

1055
01:49:02,892 --> 01:49:05,351
I have nobody in
this world but for you.

1056
01:49:06,191 --> 01:49:08,304
Don't throw me out of the house.

1057
01:49:09,852 --> 01:49:15,218
I did everything for this house.
Washed clothes and dishes.

1058
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:21,067
Swept and swapped. Stayed hungry,
listened to your wife's abuses!

1059
01:49:22,334 --> 01:49:25,132
But I never let the world
hear about our family problems.

1060
01:49:25,793 --> 01:49:27,826
I kept up this false appearance.

1061
01:49:29,328 --> 01:49:30,850
Don't throw me out son!

1062
01:49:33,185 --> 01:49:37,117
Tomorrow if I wander in the streets
nobody will say this is Rashid.

1063
01:49:38,090 --> 01:49:41,153
Everybody will say,
this is Anwar's father!

1064
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:46,187
Don't take the family honour
on to the streets my son.

1065
01:49:47,681 --> 01:49:48,857
Anwar...

1066
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:55,054
Whenever you take me
out of this house...

1067
01:49:56,908 --> 01:49:59,051
...take me out on your shoulders.

1068
01:50:22,813 --> 01:50:24,024
Avtaar.

1069
01:50:27,085 --> 01:50:29,117
I had fallen in my eyes.

1070
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:33,593
Today I fell in your eyes too!

1071
01:50:48,462 --> 01:50:50,898
Everything is in the open!

1072
01:51:19,417 --> 01:51:21,125
Eat something.

1073
01:51:21,633 --> 01:51:25,925
No, I can't eat.

1074
01:51:29,055 --> 01:51:32,951
Rashid, have a bite or two.

1075
01:51:34,969 --> 01:51:39,005
No. I'm not hungry at all.

1076
01:51:40,681 --> 01:51:42,120
It won't go down my throat.

1077
01:51:53,106 --> 01:51:54,875
- Eat one morsel.
- No.

1078
01:51:59,531 --> 01:52:01,489
For the sake of my friendship.

1079
01:52:18,711 --> 01:52:21,710
God knows how many Avtaar
Kishens exist on this earth!

1080
01:52:22,498 --> 01:52:26,382
How many Rashids!
This is a problem.

1081
01:52:27,149 --> 01:52:28,624
An issue.

1082
01:52:29,378 --> 01:52:33,203
A problem, an issue!

1083
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:45,914
Friends this is not
an orphanage or an inn.

1084
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:49,875
This is our house, yours and mine.

1085
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,437
It's a place of relations
based on feelings.

1086
01:52:53,608 --> 01:52:58,656
It's for those who are alone
despite being crowded by relatives.

1087
01:53:00,687 --> 01:53:05,318
This house is not for those
whom society has shunned.

1088
01:53:05,919 --> 01:53:10,125
But those shunned by their own!

1089
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:15,756
What is this injustice that after
life long hard work and experience..

1090
01:53:15,781 --> 01:53:20,734
People retire and are thrown away
like useless, discarded parts.

1091
01:53:21,751 --> 01:53:24,697
The oil is present but
the lamp is extinguished!

1092
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:30,343
We will light these lamps again!
Muster up your courage.

1093
01:53:30,897 --> 01:53:33,139
Create the desire to live.

1094
01:53:33,571 --> 01:53:35,554
And proceed forward.

1095
01:53:37,808 --> 01:53:41,115
Friends, get up, walk and run.

1096
01:53:41,546 --> 01:53:44,489
Don't give up living before you die!

1097
01:53:55,258 --> 01:53:56,566
"Friends..."

1098
01:53:56,753 --> 01:53:59,461
"Friends..."

1099
01:53:59,502 --> 01:54:03,812
"Friends, get up and run..."

1100
01:54:03,853 --> 01:54:07,867
"Friends, get up and run..."

1101
01:54:07,908 --> 01:54:12,007
"...don't stop living before death."

1102
01:54:12,048 --> 01:54:13,407
"Friends..."

1103
01:54:13,516 --> 01:54:16,225
"Friends..."

1104
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:20,296
"Friends, get up and run..."

1105
01:54:20,337 --> 01:54:24,593
"Friends, get up and run..."

1106
01:54:24,634 --> 01:54:30,961
"...don't stop living before death."

1107
01:54:31,002 --> 01:54:33,005
"Friends..."

1108
01:54:54,461 --> 01:55:02,320
"We are no less than these youngsters."

1109
01:55:02,367 --> 01:55:06,143
"We are no less than these youngsters."

1110
01:55:06,168 --> 01:55:12,554
"We are not dependent on them."

1111
01:55:12,595 --> 01:55:14,343
"We are not dependent on them."

1112
01:55:14,384 --> 01:55:20,539
"So, shatter their illusion."

1113
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,489
"Friends..."

1114
01:55:22,530 --> 01:55:26,648
"Friends, get up and run..."

1115
01:55:26,689 --> 01:55:30,656
"...don't stop living before death."

1116
01:55:30,697 --> 01:55:32,519
"Friends..."

1117
01:56:03,445 --> 01:56:06,804
"Why are sitting so listlessly?"

1118
01:56:06,845 --> 01:56:10,007
"Why are sitting so listlessly?"

1119
01:56:10,048 --> 01:56:13,398
"You are such an experienced man."

1120
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:17,398
"You are such an experienced man."

1121
01:56:17,630 --> 01:56:24,023
"Play your innings;
don't run away from the field."

1122
01:56:24,064 --> 01:56:25,947
"Friends..."

1123
01:56:25,988 --> 01:56:30,179
"Friends, get up and run..."

1124
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:34,211
"...don't stop living before death."

1125
01:56:34,252 --> 01:56:36,248
"Friends..."

1126
01:57:05,315 --> 01:57:08,884
"We've made the decision..."

1127
01:57:08,925 --> 01:57:13,729
"We've made the decision..."

1128
01:57:13,754 --> 01:57:17,472
"...not to give in."

1129
01:57:17,535 --> 01:57:21,539
"Not to give in."

1130
01:57:21,594 --> 01:57:25,665
"Not to give in."

1131
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:31,667
"Live respectfully
not on their crumbs."

1132
01:57:31,692 --> 01:57:33,589
"Friends..."

1133
01:57:33,652 --> 01:57:37,777
"Friends, get up and run..."

1134
01:57:37,808 --> 01:57:41,875
"Friends, get up and run..."

1135
01:57:41,916 --> 01:57:47,589
"...don't stop living before death."

1136
01:57:47,614 --> 01:57:49,701
"Friends..."

1137
01:58:07,461 --> 01:58:09,828
No problem. You can call everybody.

1138
01:58:13,781 --> 01:58:17,740
But how did this happen?
I don't understand a thing.

1139
01:58:19,347 --> 01:58:23,453
What's the matter?
Nobody is seen in the factory.

1140
01:58:23,582 --> 01:58:25,902
All the workers have left.

1141
01:58:26,311 --> 01:58:28,957
Left work? Why?

1142
01:58:29,698 --> 01:58:32,106
They have been employed at
double the salary elsewhere.

1143
01:58:32,248 --> 01:58:33,469
Double the salary!

1144
01:58:34,117 --> 01:58:36,180
Who is paying them double?

1145
01:58:37,409 --> 01:58:38,437
Dad.

1146
01:58:39,128 --> 01:58:41,670
Why is he out to ruin us?

1147
01:58:42,778 --> 01:58:44,138
After all what does he want?

1148
01:58:53,822 --> 01:58:54,669
Yes.

1149
01:58:58,693 --> 01:59:00,560
No, that's not the case.

1150
01:59:01,167 --> 01:59:04,099
I'll be there at sharp 4.

1151
01:59:04,736 --> 01:59:05,740
Bye.

1152
01:59:06,092 --> 01:59:07,833
Good day sir.

1153
01:59:14,961 --> 01:59:16,435
- Miss Amy.
- Yes, sir?

1154
01:59:17,866 --> 01:59:20,974
Why do you send anybody
without an appointment to me?

1155
01:59:23,906 --> 01:59:26,802
Don't you recognise me?

1156
01:59:28,948 --> 01:59:33,544
Mr. Laxminarayan,
how can I ever forget you?

1157
01:59:36,580 --> 01:59:38,466
You seem upset.

1158
01:59:40,867 --> 01:59:44,770
So how can I help you?

1159
01:59:45,722 --> 01:59:50,653
You've taken away everything from me!
You've erased my name from the market

1160
01:59:51,818 --> 01:59:54,692
You gave me such a kick in
business, that it broke my back!

1161
01:59:58,216 --> 02:00:00,937
Somebody's profit, somebody's loss.

1162
02:00:01,464 --> 02:00:03,918
Somebody's loss is somebody's gain.

1163
02:00:04,444 --> 02:00:06,694
This is the world!

1164
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:10,168
Today you had my factory shut down.

1165
02:00:11,374 --> 02:00:14,598
You grabbed all my workers, my talent.

1166
02:00:17,184 --> 02:00:18,181
Talent?

1167
02:00:19,605 --> 02:00:22,301
Once you too had
snatched somebody's talent!

1168
02:00:23,892 --> 02:00:24,978
Laxminarayan!

1169
02:00:27,540 --> 02:00:29,067
I will be ruined Dad.

1170
02:00:30,085 --> 02:00:32,602
My blood and sweat too
is mingled in that business.

1171
02:00:33,228 --> 02:00:35,481
At least think of my future.

1172
02:00:36,122 --> 02:00:39,246
I have no interest in anyone's future!

1173
02:00:41,081 --> 02:00:42,597
Mr. Chander Kishen...

1174
02:00:43,628 --> 02:00:47,028
...today every man has the
right to think for himself.

1175
02:00:48,098 --> 02:00:50,950
If I think about myself,
what's wrong with it?

1176
02:00:51,764 --> 02:00:53,333
Don't waste my time. You may go.

1177
02:01:13,895 --> 02:01:17,786
After every kind of inquiry,
it has been proved...

1178
02:01:18,323 --> 02:01:20,622
..that Ramesh has misappropriated
50000 rupees belonging to the bank!

1179
02:01:20,834 --> 02:01:24,559
This is wrong. I did nothing.

1180
02:01:24,903 --> 02:01:26,850
I did not misappropriate funds.

1181
02:01:27,159 --> 02:01:30,098
I am innocent!

1182
02:01:30,545 --> 02:01:32,004
That will be decided by the court.

1183
02:01:32,307 --> 02:01:33,901
You are under arrest, Mr. Ramesh.

1184
02:01:33,989 --> 02:01:34,473
Sir.

1185
02:01:34,514 --> 02:01:35,389
Tukaram.

1186
02:01:36,170 --> 02:01:37,014
Sir.

1187
02:01:51,828 --> 02:01:52,769
Daughter-in-law!

1188
02:01:55,317 --> 02:01:56,460
You and here?

1189
02:02:03,283 --> 02:02:07,481
Mother, I am ruined! A mountain
of difficulties fell on us!

1190
02:02:08,010 --> 02:02:10,434
The bank people acted mean with us.

1191
02:02:10,773 --> 02:02:14,700
They accused my husband of
misappropriation and had him arrested.

1192
02:02:15,056 --> 02:02:15,976
What?

1193
02:02:18,172 --> 02:02:21,859
Ramesh arrested!
Did you hear?

1194
02:02:24,490 --> 02:02:25,652
I am listening.

1195
02:02:28,231 --> 02:02:33,214
What's surprising about it?

1196
02:02:34,192 --> 02:02:37,317
He is innocent. He has been framed.

1197
02:02:38,562 --> 02:02:40,465
Save him father!

1198
02:02:41,373 --> 02:02:44,622
Or he will be imprisoned!
We will be destroyed!

1199
02:02:46,173 --> 02:02:49,012
Nobody supports criminals.

1200
02:02:50,178 --> 02:02:51,848
You've come to the wrong door.

1201
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:02,194
Mother, please do something.

1202
02:03:02,465 --> 02:03:05,101
Pay the bail and save your son.

1203
02:03:10,122 --> 02:03:11,425
Come with me.

1204
02:03:21,125 --> 02:03:22,025
Radha...

1205
02:03:24,255 --> 02:03:26,503
You won't pay the bail.

1206
02:03:29,168 --> 02:03:30,936
I bind you by oath!

1207
02:04:16,744 --> 02:04:17,549
Sir...

1208
02:04:19,466 --> 02:04:21,840
This is between you and me.

1209
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,012
Don't worry, I will pay
bail for Ramesh tomorrow morning.

1210
02:04:26,666 --> 02:04:28,825
What is the need for money?

1211
02:04:29,661 --> 02:04:30,984
There is need.

1212
02:04:31,957 --> 02:04:34,166
I don't trust Ramesh at all.

1213
02:04:35,444 --> 02:04:42,497
And I'm not paying this bail for
Ramesh but for the sake of Radha.

1214
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:48,793
I can't bear to see my life cry.

1215
02:04:56,814 --> 02:04:59,036
Release Ramesh Kishen.
- Okay, sir.

1216
02:04:59,931 --> 02:05:01,488
Thank you, inspector.
- It is alright.

1217
02:05:04,859 --> 02:05:05,987
Sir...

1218
02:05:06,976 --> 02:05:09,564
We are obliged to you
for paying the bail.

1219
02:05:10,258 --> 02:05:12,083
We can't forget it all our lives.

1220
02:05:13,702 --> 02:05:15,128
Strangers are better than family.

1221
02:05:23,697 --> 02:05:25,949
You are an angel.

1222
02:05:26,271 --> 02:05:29,559
I've done nothing son.
It's all God's doing.

1223
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:30,876
Come, let's go.

1224
02:05:31,862 --> 02:05:32,693
Come.

1225
02:05:38,561 --> 02:05:40,057
Is Rashid Anwar at home?

1226
02:05:43,985 --> 02:05:46,869
- he doesn't live here.
- Then where does he live?

1227
02:05:47,356 --> 02:05:53,612
- What's the matter?
- He has won the Provident Fund case.

1228
02:05:54,034 --> 02:05:56,375
That had been going on for 5 years.
His draft for 37500 rupees is with me.

1229
02:05:57,242 --> 02:06:00,614
37500!

1230
02:06:01,638 --> 02:06:05,752
Why are you standing outside?
Please come inside.

1231
02:06:05,793 --> 02:06:09,691
- Did you hear?
- What's the matter?

1232
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:13,098
- Remember Dad's case?
About Provident Fund? - Yes.

1233
02:06:13,139 --> 02:06:17,211
He won the case! Lord Almighty
has answered our prayers!

1234
02:06:18,945 --> 02:06:21,296
Brother don't feel offended.

1235
02:06:21,562 --> 02:06:29,177
Somebody keeps coming to pester Dad
so I said he doesn't live here.

1236
02:06:29,218 --> 02:06:30,115
Then call him.

1237
02:06:32,616 --> 02:06:35,653
God! he's Just had lunch and gone out

1238
02:06:35,995 --> 02:06:39,302
- he'll return by evening.
- Okay, I'll come later.

1239
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:43,927
Why bother cosign again?
You can give the draft to me.

1240
02:06:44,558 --> 02:06:48,053
- I'm his only son.
- And I'm his only daughter-in-law.

1241
02:06:48,409 --> 02:06:52,255
Sorry its government work.
I can't give the draft to you.

1242
02:06:56,184 --> 02:06:58,561
This happened because of you!

1243
02:06:58,759 --> 02:07:01,701
I ask, in which house
don't people fight?

1244
02:07:01,841 --> 02:07:07,436
It doesn't mean you forget him!
Wasn't it your duty to bring him back?

1245
02:07:07,931 --> 02:07:12,256
God forbid! Nobody should
get such a useless son!

1246
02:07:15,124 --> 02:07:19,022
God knows what
condition Dad must be in!

1247
02:07:25,936 --> 02:07:29,045
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem.

1248
02:07:29,478 --> 02:07:31,772
This is the result of the
35 years of service you put in.

1249
02:07:32,071 --> 02:07:35,225
You deserve it. I must go.

1250
02:07:35,468 --> 02:07:36,930
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1251
02:07:47,079 --> 02:07:50,996
How did you come here?

1252
02:07:51,284 --> 02:07:54,334
Dad and Mom are here to meet you.

1253
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:10,544
- Greetings, father!
- Greetings, father!

1254
02:08:12,173 --> 02:08:15,084
How did you come here?

1255
02:08:16,164 --> 02:08:17,197
Is everything fine?

1256
02:08:18,022 --> 02:08:23,108
Dad, you left home and happiness
and prosperity left with you.

1257
02:08:25,202 --> 02:08:29,702
If we made a mistake,
please overlook it.

1258
02:08:31,733 --> 02:08:33,959
May the Lord punish me!

1259
02:08:34,222 --> 02:08:39,201
If one cruel word escapes my lips,
you may pull out my tongue!

1260
02:08:39,818 --> 02:08:44,803
For the sake of God, spit out
your anger and come back home!

1261
02:08:45,806 --> 02:08:50,420
To grind flour?
To wash clothes? To be scolded?

1262
02:08:50,508 --> 02:08:54,012
- I swear by God...
- Don't take false promises.

1263
02:08:54,426 --> 02:08:57,084
You'll face the Almighty
with the face of a pig!

1264
02:08:57,723 --> 02:09:01,311
Hen-pecked! You ruined
everything for one woman!

1265
02:09:01,368 --> 02:09:01,988
Father...

1266
02:09:02,029 --> 02:09:03,833
Wipe those crocodile tears!

1267
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:08,336
I understand everything.
This is the miracle of money!

1268
02:09:08,769 --> 02:09:12,433
My Provident Fund is
dripping down your eyes!

1269
02:09:13,187 --> 02:09:16,209
As if it's a bone not cash,
that you smelt and came here!

1270
02:09:16,821 --> 02:09:20,286
Hear this carefully!
You won't get a single penny!

1271
02:09:21,379 --> 02:09:24,236
Don't be so cruel-hearted!

1272
02:09:24,277 --> 02:09:26,531
Take her away from my sight!

1273
02:09:27,021 --> 02:09:29,794
The Rashid who lived off your
leftovers is dead and gone!

1274
02:09:32,204 --> 02:09:36,177
Keep one thing in mind, God forbid...

1275
02:09:36,658 --> 02:09:39,685
...if your son throws you out of the
house when he grows...

1276
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:44,340
...come here with my name.
You'll get place to stay.

1277
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:08,317
We've interviewed you.
We'll let you know later.

1278
02:10:08,576 --> 02:10:09,353
Thank you, sir.

1279
02:10:09,865 --> 02:10:10,481
Next.

1280
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:14,942
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1281
02:10:15,623 --> 02:10:17,206
Your name?

1282
02:10:17,323 --> 02:10:18,732
Ramesh Kishen.

1283
02:10:19,436 --> 02:10:20,990
- Age?
- 26 years.

1284
02:10:21,953 --> 02:10:26,029
- .Qualifications.
- Cheating, deception.

1285
02:10:27,045 --> 02:10:30,841
Swindling, craftiness,
misappropriation.

1286
02:10:31,078 --> 02:10:32,926
- Father.
- Mr. Gupta...

1287
02:10:33,333 --> 02:10:37,262
We don't want such a qualified
and educated man for this Job!

1288
02:10:38,124 --> 02:10:39,214
Father.

1289
02:11:07,759 --> 02:11:08,607
Chander!

1290
02:11:12,036 --> 02:11:15,814
- What is this?
- He is in difficulty.

1291
02:11:15,870 --> 02:11:17,706
I want to help him.

1292
02:11:17,863 --> 02:11:22,068
If you want to help them do it
with money earned yourself!

1293
02:11:22,572 --> 02:11:26,161
Our money is not for charity!
That you distribute to beggars!

1294
02:11:26,257 --> 02:11:29,513
Aren't you ashamed to insult them?

1295
02:11:29,648 --> 02:11:32,865
You should be ashamed.
You've started stealing!

1296
02:11:33,078 --> 02:11:38,075
- You're crossing all limits!
- You are crossing limits not me!

1297
02:11:38,597 --> 02:11:41,951
Don't quarrel because of us.

1298
02:11:42,387 --> 02:11:45,769
We came to you as we're family.

1299
02:11:45,982 --> 02:11:47,974
I hate family!

1300
02:11:48,316 --> 02:11:52,482
Go away from here.
I don't want to see your faces!

1301
02:12:00,838 --> 02:12:05,959
- This was very bad!
- No it was good!

1302
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:08,917
Shut your mouth!

1303
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:11,300
I've been tolerating you for long!

1304
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:15,638
If you want to live off us,
you'll have to put up with more!

1305
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,358
- Renu!
- Shameless! How dare you!

1306
02:12:19,031 --> 02:12:22,286
See how unjustly she behaved me!

1307
02:12:22,699 --> 02:12:25,435
- I'm her husband!
- I made the same mistake.

1308
02:12:26,154 --> 02:12:29,476
Money can change the
clothes not the body!

1309
02:12:29,594 --> 02:12:31,238
You are right.

1310
02:12:31,834 --> 02:12:34,997
Your father earned some money
and forgot himself and his place!

1311
02:12:35,431 --> 02:12:38,880
he blocked our means of livelihood!
And you're responsible for it!

1312
02:12:39,131 --> 02:12:42,904
- What's my fault?
- The fault is of the cheap blood!

1313
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,700
The way your scoundrel of a
father behaved with us..

1314
02:12:47,234 --> 02:12:50,982
I should have thrown you out
of the house at seeing that!

1315
02:12:52,421 --> 02:12:55,357
But I'm not depraved.
I won't do that.

1316
02:12:55,967 --> 02:13:02,055
But you may leave if you want to.
The door is open. Come dear.

1317
02:13:15,567 --> 02:13:19,301
Two bars of Lux, one cream
and one toothpaste.

1318
02:13:19,342 --> 02:13:23,011
Excuse me first clear the old account.

1319
02:13:23,535 --> 02:13:27,848
It's been 3 whole months.
You owe me 450 rupees.

1320
02:13:29,062 --> 02:13:31,504
I'll clear the debt. Trust me.

1321
02:13:32,721 --> 02:13:35,207
The days of trust have gone sir.

1322
02:13:36,234 --> 02:13:39,262
These days I'm little hard pressed.

1323
02:13:39,939 --> 02:13:42,762
I'm not running a factory.
I have a small business.

1324
02:13:42,849 --> 02:13:47,004
If everyone takes credit,
my whole business will flop!

1325
02:13:47,169 --> 02:13:50,676
- But...
- I will give no credit now!

1326
02:13:51,058 --> 02:13:53,705
Times change a bit and you turn away!

1327
02:13:53,942 --> 02:13:56,879
have you forgotten you've taken
thousands of rupees from these hands?

1328
02:13:57,151 --> 02:14:00,933
But in return for goods.
That was not charity!

1329
02:14:01,273 --> 02:14:02,731
Neither have you done me any favours!

1330
02:14:02,947 --> 02:14:06,319
When I don't have money, you stop
giving credit! Is this decency?

1331
02:14:06,485 --> 02:14:09,311
I know how decent you are!

1332
02:14:09,352 --> 02:14:13,225
Have you forgotten it was you who...

1333
02:14:13,324 --> 02:14:15,435
...closed your Dad's cigarette
credit when he fell on bad times?

1334
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:16,543
Ramdulare!

1335
02:15:58,014 --> 02:15:58,751
Kishen...

1336
02:16:00,849 --> 02:16:01,891
Forgive them.

1337
02:16:03,285 --> 02:16:05,030
It is your own who are forgiven.

1338
02:16:07,603 --> 02:16:08,772
I have forgotten them.

1339
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:12,724
I can't forget.

1340
02:16:17,059 --> 02:16:20,707
My children ...will stay with me.

1341
02:16:21,318 --> 02:16:22,537
That's impossible!

1342
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:27,217
Why not? Don't I have any worth,
any respect in your eyes?

1343
02:16:27,258 --> 02:16:28,894
Can't I do anything?

1344
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:32,850
Who was your partner in Joy
and sorrow? It was me.

1345
02:16:33,555 --> 02:16:36,780
I walked with you with a heavy heart.

1346
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:39,662
I never turned to look at the kids.

1347
02:16:40,422 --> 02:16:44,240
Because I had the assurance that
they are happy where they are.

1348
02:16:44,824 --> 02:16:47,708
But today they are homeless,
with no support.

1349
02:16:48,151 --> 02:16:49,491
They are broken in every way.

1350
02:16:49,568 --> 02:16:54,311
Whom are you mourning for? The ones
who're perpetual wounds for parents?

1351
02:16:55,023 --> 02:16:57,523
They cannot stay in my house!

1352
02:16:58,601 --> 02:17:01,990
This is also my house!
I too have some right over it!

1353
02:17:02,535 --> 02:17:05,757
You have a right
over my body and soul.

1354
02:17:06,496 --> 02:17:11,209
You are everywhere but I have
no place for your maternal love!

1355
02:17:12,418 --> 02:17:15,428
Because today you have name!

1356
02:17:16,476 --> 02:17:18,790
You have been blinded by
the glitter of wealth!

1357
02:17:19,164 --> 02:17:20,923
So blind that you can't
see your own blood!

1358
02:17:21,911 --> 02:17:26,314
Don't be so cruel!
They are repenting for their deeds.

1359
02:17:26,788 --> 02:17:30,645
And even God forgives all sins
for one tear of repentance!

1360
02:17:31,882 --> 02:17:33,636
I am not God!

1361
02:17:36,921 --> 02:17:37,862
Kishen!

1362
02:17:43,086 --> 02:17:46,950
One day you said I never
asked you for anything in life.

1363
02:17:47,744 --> 02:17:49,722
And I said I will ask for it
when the time comes.

1364
02:17:50,535 --> 02:17:54,098
And you said you'd wait for that day.

1365
02:17:56,764 --> 02:17:58,950
The day has come.

1366
02:18:04,625 --> 02:18:06,878
Give me my children!

1367
02:18:21,241 --> 02:18:23,029
- Hello.
- Kishen...

1368
02:18:24,108 --> 02:18:26,887
It's quite late.
You're still in the office.

1369
02:18:28,491 --> 02:18:29,791
When are you coming home?

1370
02:18:30,666 --> 02:18:35,193
I may not be able to come home.

1371
02:18:36,563 --> 02:18:39,733
I have an important meeting going on.

1372
02:20:13,756 --> 02:20:14,656
Kishen!

1373
02:20:22,007 --> 02:20:27,069
You came here in this storm?

1374
02:20:27,852 --> 02:20:30,116
No storm could stop me today!

1375
02:20:31,768 --> 02:20:33,998
Why aren't you coming home?

1376
02:20:36,769 --> 02:20:39,788
There's no time. Work has increased.

1377
02:20:41,048 --> 02:20:44,380
Work hasn't increased.
It has got spoilt.

1378
02:20:44,863 --> 02:20:49,217
Whom are you making excuses to?
Showing this anger? To me?

1379
02:20:50,834 --> 02:20:54,858
You know I don't get angry.

1380
02:20:56,292 --> 02:21:00,358
It would be better if you would.
You could hit me and be relieved!

1381
02:21:00,633 --> 02:21:04,686
I would be at peace!
But why are you burning me within?

1382
02:21:08,452 --> 02:21:10,234
What are you saying?

1383
02:21:10,554 --> 02:21:12,684
I know you better than I know myself.

1384
02:21:13,312 --> 02:21:16,355
I supported my children
so you left my side!

1385
02:21:16,784 --> 02:21:18,506
You are punishing me so severely.

1386
02:21:23,464 --> 02:21:25,693
You couldn't spend a minute without me

1387
02:21:26,159 --> 02:21:30,037
Today it is 4 days and
I am tossing on live embers.

1388
02:21:30,148 --> 02:21:31,815
But you don't give a damn!

1389
02:21:32,504 --> 02:21:35,779
You broke all relations, gave up
your rights and came here.

1390
02:21:36,416 --> 02:21:39,771
I'm living for you.

1391
02:21:43,905 --> 02:21:46,140
You have enough people.

1392
02:21:47,438 --> 02:21:51,337
A thorn pricked your heart Just
because motherhood beckoned me!

1393
02:21:51,378 --> 02:21:52,836
And you're sulking with it.

1394
02:21:53,967 --> 02:21:56,952
Why don't you think of
the cross roads I am at?

1395
02:21:57,221 --> 02:21:59,873
Wherever I go, I am incomplete!

1396
02:22:00,143 --> 02:22:02,741
Even a stone would melt at my state!

1397
02:22:07,054 --> 02:22:10,694
But you are not even a stone!
You are a lifeless soul!

1398
02:22:11,427 --> 02:22:13,824
No love, emotions, feelings!

1399
02:22:13,896 --> 02:22:15,536
You have no heart!

1400
02:22:15,764 --> 02:22:18,466
You are heartless!

1401
02:22:27,223 --> 02:22:29,174
You have no heart!

1402
02:22:31,144 --> 02:22:32,445
You are heartless!

1403
02:22:34,539 --> 02:22:35,847
You are heartless!

1404
02:22:37,171 --> 02:22:38,790
You have no heart!

1405
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:41,444
You are heartless!

1406
02:22:42,911 --> 02:22:44,482
You have no heart!

1407
02:22:44,551 --> 02:22:47,180
You are heartless!

1408
02:23:55,991 --> 02:23:59,457
Avtaar! Avtaar!

1409
02:24:03,929 --> 02:24:05,202
Come, sir!

1410
02:24:05,783 --> 02:24:07,904
Where is Avtaar?

1411
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:14,463
What's the matter?
Is everything all right?

1412
02:24:15,297 --> 02:24:19,772
When we were with you,
we were really happy.

1413
02:24:20,836 --> 02:24:24,834
But now he's not the same.

1414
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:29,920
He has changed totally.
Today he has forgotten me!

1415
02:24:29,961 --> 02:24:32,610
No! What are you saying?

1416
02:24:32,823 --> 02:24:36,773
He can forget himself not you.

1417
02:24:39,349 --> 02:24:42,250
I will always remember that night.

1418
02:24:43,858 --> 02:24:50,829
And I'm giving this bail
for Radha not Ramesh.

1419
02:24:52,196 --> 02:24:56,945
I can't bear to see my life cry.

1420
02:24:57,835 --> 02:24:58,804
What?

1421
02:25:00,452 --> 02:25:04,859
Meaning.. the bail was paid by..

1422
02:25:31,288 --> 02:25:31,866
Hello.

1423
02:25:32,426 --> 02:25:35,885
Mistress! Come fast!
Sir has suffered a stroke!

1424
02:26:11,703 --> 02:26:13,513
Forgive me.

1425
02:26:14,570 --> 02:26:16,155
Forgive me.

1426
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:19,292
Don't cry silly.

1427
02:26:21,697 --> 02:26:23,140
I am fine.

1428
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:29,747
Radha.

1429
02:26:34,290 --> 02:26:36,445
So far I was on duty.

1430
02:26:38,055 --> 02:26:42,279
Looks like it's time for me to retire.

1431
02:26:42,633 --> 02:26:47,492
Don't say that!

1432
02:27:19,413 --> 02:27:20,684
Radha...

1433
02:27:22,142 --> 02:27:24,000
I have only one request.

1434
02:27:26,253 --> 02:27:35,555
After me make one Apna Ghar
centre in every city of the country.

1435
02:27:36,656 --> 02:27:38,718
Make my dream come true.

1436
02:27:45,944 --> 02:27:49,343
From my property...

1437
02:27:50,468 --> 02:27:53,031
...I leave 2 lakhs to Ramesh Kishen.

1438
02:27:53,888 --> 02:27:57,101
And 2 lakhs to Chander Kishen.

1439
02:27:58,708 --> 02:28:02,195
Not because they are my sons.

1440
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:10,594
But because their behaviour gave me
a new direction, showed me a new path.

1441
02:28:14,236 --> 02:28:18,442
Sewak, who all his life...

1442
02:28:19,405 --> 02:28:23,233
... served me selflessly.

1443
02:28:24,308 --> 02:28:28,552
I wish to put one
more burden on him.

1444
02:28:30,903 --> 02:28:34,146
If something happens to me..

1445
02:28:35,350 --> 02:28:36,709
Then my body should be...

1446
02:28:38,431 --> 02:28:42,062
...torched and cremated by Sewak.

1447
02:28:46,986 --> 02:28:48,225
Sir!

1448
02:28:51,045 --> 02:28:51,933
Sir.

1449
02:29:21,553 --> 02:29:30,243
"The world never stops moving."

1450
02:29:32,385 --> 02:29:39,089
"The world never stops moving."

1451
02:29:39,372 --> 02:29:46,145
"The world is a stage."

1452
02:29:46,365 --> 02:29:53,006
"Friends, bid me a cheerful farewell."

1453
02:29:53,298 --> 02:30:00,553
"Leave my hand and let me go now."

1454
02:30:03,969 --> 02:30:11,053
"Don't cry and break my promise."

1455
02:30:11,094 --> 02:30:17,881
"Leave my hand and let me go now."

1456
02:30:18,321 --> 02:30:21,670
"Leave my hand, friends."

1457
02:30:22,502 --> 02:30:25,456
"Friends."
