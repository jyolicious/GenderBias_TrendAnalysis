1
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:56,888
Return this and my love to him.

2
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,292
Here is your ring! This is
what you wanted. Take it!

3
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:10,734
Now you must be feeling great!
Shame on you!

4
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,379
The girl who was your life,
your love...

5
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:17,443
The one you were living for...
You broke off with her!

6
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,542
May l know the reason?

7
00:01:20,285 --> 00:01:21,980
Why dig up the past?

8
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:27,017
l know you loved her a lot.

9
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:31,828
Shall l tell you something? She'll
always remember the pain you gave her.

10
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:36,199
So l've kept both the rules of love.

11
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:40,629
You were ready to fight
the world and die for her!

12
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:43,166
l don't understand why you did this.

13
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:45,576
Do you really want to know?

14
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:49,879
Because l am shattered.

15
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:52,944
You know the people in this house.

16
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,149
There's no place
in their hearts for her.

17
00:01:56,955 --> 00:02:00,755
lf there was anyone who
could fight for her it was me.

18
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:06,286
lf there was anyone who could hold
her hand and stand by her, it was me.

19
00:02:07,332 --> 00:02:11,029
As long as l was on my feet,
l was a shield for her.

20
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,366
But today that shield is broken.

21
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:18,641
What am l today?
An incomplete cripple!

22
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,042
Who can do nothing without support!

23
00:02:23,816 --> 00:02:30,380
That is all right but
did you have to break her heart?

24
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:36,223
Till l wouldn't break
her heart, make her suffer...

25
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:40,228
Till l humiliated her,
she wouldn't have left me!

26
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,795
l didn't want to ruin her life.

27
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,832
And your own life?

28
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:51,937
What about me?
l lost everything.

29
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,646
A gust of wind took away everything.

30
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:59,047
Now even Chandni has gone.

31
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,507
You didn't inform us
that you were coming.

32
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:31,744
- l'd have come to the station.
- l didn't want to bother you.

33
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,719
Aren't you ashamed to say this?

34
00:07:35,393 --> 00:07:38,885
- She will stay with us.
- No need to say that.

35
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,198
Who else does she have in Bombay?

36
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,694
One who doesn't have anyone
has to stay in my house, is it?

37
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:45,159
This won't do.

38
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:51,405
l need a little space for shelter.

39
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:53,208
l will be very grateful.

40
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:57,211
The rent is 100 bucks.

41
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:02,083
- Water, electricity separate.
Acceptable? - Yes.

42
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:05,620
l have no extra room.
Manage here somewhere.

43
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:13,628
How did this happen?

44
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:21,161
Just assume somebody
cast an evil eye.

45
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,708
God knows why l couldn't be happy.

46
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:30,278
Now l can neither
forget nor remember.

47
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:38,080
Yet whenever l remember,
it brings tears to my eyes.

48
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:47,631
l'm telling you
today you will get a job!

49
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,393
Pay obeisance to Lord Ganpati
before you leave. You'll get the job

50
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,805
Drink this tea and get ready.

51
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:38,379
Hey! What are you doing?

52
00:09:38,683 --> 00:09:44,713
This is an emergency.
Don't look at me. Just drive.

53
00:09:51,996 --> 00:09:57,764
- You...? - l've come
from Delhi, new to your city.

54
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:02,002
l'm looking for a job.
l have an interview.

55
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:07,934
l'm already late. l'll be obliged
if you could take me to this place.

56
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,013
Do you know where l have to go?

57
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,021
Do you follow?
Why don't you say anything?

58
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:24,388
- Get off.
- Are you offended?

59
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,227
No l meant get off.
This is the place you have to go to.

60
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:38,432
Listen...l'm sure you'll get the job.

61
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,635
Go in from this door.

62
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:27,552
- You... sir?
- Surprised to see me?

63
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,793
l was nervous before l came here.

64
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,754
But seeing you has
given me confidence

65
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:39,659
This is a travel agency.

66
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:43,438
We take people around the world.

67
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:48,042
You mean you fulfill people's dreams.

68
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:56,846
Nobody ever described this
profession so beautifully.

69
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:06,125
lt will be done. Not to worry.

70
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:11,192
We have to complete the
formality of the interview.

71
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:16,067
My name is Chandni Mathur.
l have completed B.A.

72
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,139
l know shorthand and typing.

73
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:23,003
l have no experience of work
but l promise that...

74
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:28,278
lf you employ me, l'll work
with dedication and sincerity.

75
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,254
l believe it if you say so.

76
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,051
Come in.

77
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:41,825
She is Miss Chandni Mathur.
She'll work in our office.

78
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,631
Explain to her about my personnel
files and ticket reservation.

79
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:57,578
What is wrong with you?

80
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:02,008
l'm very happy today. - Why?
By the grace of God l've got a job!

81
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:08,882
Now l can breath, l can live.

82
00:13:09,794 --> 00:13:11,659
l can be alive.

83
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,476
Some of my clients
are coming this evening.

84
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:33,583
l am very busy today and
they are our important clients.

85
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:36,849
l want you to take them out
to dinner and entertain them.

86
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,453
l can't do this.

87
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:48,090
Can't do it? l don't understand.

88
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:52,302
This is not my job.

89
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:59,770
Will you tell me what's your duty?

90
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:04,070
You promised to do any job given
to you with full dedication.

91
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,543
Every job in this office
is part of your duty!

92
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,388
But l don't consider it good.

93
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,896
She doesn't think it's good!

94
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,990
This is the problem with
you middle class girls!

95
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:27,763
You decide before hand what is
good and what is not!

96
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:30,105
The dirt lies in your minds.

97
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:35,578
lf our clients are happy,
it improves our efficiency.

98
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,447
We get business from them.
This office runs because of them!

99
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:42,150
You are paid because of it!

100
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,615
This is my order.

101
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:55,223
- l can't do this.
- Then just get lost!

102
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:52,552
Madam sir has sent this.

103
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:10,767
What does he think of himself?

104
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,192
Big reception party.
ls this for me?

105
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,190
The colony was raided today.

106
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,830
lt's a government colony. You can't
keep illegal tenants like us.

107
00:17:12,336 --> 00:17:16,898
- Now what? - Nothing. Spend the
night somewhere and return by morning.

108
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,576
- The raid will finish by then.
- l have never seen Bombay.

109
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:22,239
So let's see Bombay.

110
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:31,785
We must have parties like this.

111
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:36,024
Don't worry. The government is
kind. This will be repeated.

112
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:40,321
Let's get wet.

113
00:17:45,469 --> 00:17:48,768
l'm already wet.

114
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:04,985
What are you doing?

115
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:13,227
Aren't' you ashamed? ln the office
you're the embodiment of decency.

116
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:15,790
And now alone in the middle
of the night on the footpath!

117
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:23,603
Come here.

118
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,635
She's my friend Kiran.

119
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,003
And her husband.

120
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:34,342
- We're paying guests in a colony.
- lt has been raided today.

121
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:37,313
So we're having a forced picnic.

122
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:40,881
Tonight we're helpless, constrained.

123
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:44,952
Then come home with me.

124
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:47,586
Your house?

125
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:53,760
My mother will be happy to meet you.

126
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,241
Come in.

127
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,339
Meet my mother. They are..

128
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,545
She is Chandni, works in my office.

129
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:16,992
And this is her friend. Her husband.

130
00:19:19,763 --> 00:19:23,028
Since when have you become so good?

131
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,934
Feeling sorry for mother's
loneliness, he brought guests.

132
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:32,206
l am trying to be nice
plus they had a problem.

133
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:34,408
Thank you very much sir.

134
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:40,147
Consider this your own house.
l'll change and join you.

135
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:46,347
- Will you have coffee?
- On one condition.

136
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:49,284
l'll make it and
everybody will drink.

137
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:54,695
Brace yourself for the worst
coffee you ever had in your life!

138
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:57,700
- l'm witness to that!
- don't ruin my reputation.

139
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,269
The kitchen is there.

140
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:04,674
There's a room here if
you want to wash up.

141
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:14,345
Tell me don't you feel as if
we own this place.

142
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:17,050
- And you're the guest.
- Absolutely.

143
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,888
- Come here.
- Will you beat me?

144
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:27,324
Yes l will! Come here.

145
00:20:30,534 --> 00:20:31,865
Such a dear child.

146
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:43,841
Sir, may l say something
if it would offend you?

147
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,915
You are something in the office
and another at home.

148
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:56,192
One form is for the world
but one is for yourself.

149
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:11,600
Do you like the rain?

150
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:22,350
l love the rains!

151
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:30,892
l'm enjoying myself!

152
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:35,329
Let's go. Goodbye.

153
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,207
Couldn't sleep or l woke you?

154
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,907
lf l'd slept tonight,
l'd have lost something.

155
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:45,311
Even l have lost something.

156
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,047
And l'm searching for it.

157
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:51,921
Do you stay awake like this?

158
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:57,985
Staying awake is in my stars.

159
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:04,093
lt sounds as if you
asked for this sorrow.

160
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:11,074
When there's no cure for the pain
one must consider pain the cure.

161
00:26:12,142 --> 00:26:17,011
Do you believe that sorrow
is reduced by sharing?

162
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:27,791
To share pain one has to
undertake a long journey.

163
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:32,327
Every moment has to be relived.

164
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:37,123
lt's very difficult to embark
on a journey filled with pain.

165
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:43,367
From where do l begin?

166
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:59,084
What are you talking about?

167
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,150
What do you think?

168
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:11,165
- Let's play a game.
- What game?

169
00:27:12,102 --> 00:27:15,902
l'll make 3 guesses about you
and you do the same with me.

170
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:24,145
The first, you've
never fallen in love.

171
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:30,851
You've taken over a huge
business at a young age.

172
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:34,250
Are you a detective
or an astrologer?

173
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:39,761
Some terrific incident is
going to occur in your life.

174
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:42,424
That has already happened.

175
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:47,636
Now you make 3 guesses about me.

176
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:53,933
One guess out of the three
is that my life is stark.

177
00:27:55,545 --> 00:27:58,514
Fill it with the colors
of your love.

178
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:05,945
l want to see this world
with you, through your eyes.

179
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:12,193
For how long will you be away?

180
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,866
- Why do you ask?
- We've just met and you're going!

181
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,802
lt's just a few days.
What should l get for you?

182
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:26,167
One condition.
His name is Lalit.

183
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:31,411
Tell him life is
terrible without him.

184
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:36,241
Bring him back with you
as soon as possible.

185
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,820
You don't worry about that.

186
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:46,222
lf he's careless about you...

187
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:50,790
l'll carry him on my shoulders
and drop him at your feet!

188
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:55,270
His place is in my heart not feet!

189
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:04,670
Will you do one thing for me?

190
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:09,747
- Why do you ask?
- First promise me.

191
00:29:11,154 --> 00:29:12,746
l promise.

192
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:17,916
Promise to take care of yourself.

193
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,332
And when the time comes,
you'll marry a beautiful girl.

194
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,865
More beautiful than me.

195
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:28,768
Why are you punishing me?

196
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:35,311
Life is very beautiful and
l don't have the time.

197
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,277
For me, my love.

198
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:48,215
Yes l promise. For the sake
of your love and you...

199
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:54,525
Now l want nothing from life.

200
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,598
Now my life is fulfilled.

201
00:30:01,738 --> 00:30:06,801
And in a flash she had
left my hand and gone forever.

202
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:14,915
l still feel the warmth of her
palm in mine, her breath on mine.

203
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:21,514
Whenever l recall her smiling
face vibrating with life...

204
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:25,724
The burden of the pain increases.

205
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:31,633
ls this any life?

206
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,594
ls this life worth living?

207
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:43,471
Just think it's a habit to live.

208
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:45,906
And nothing else.

209
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:48,979
And nothing at all.

210
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:09,101
l like Chandni very much.

211
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:12,774
Mother you like every girl.

212
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:18,073
Seeing her has raised
some hope in my heart.

213
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:20,609
l liked her very much.

214
00:31:26,122 --> 00:31:28,556
ls there any point in this?

215
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:35,191
People who have to die do die
but the others have to live.

216
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,033
l accept this.

217
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:41,762
One has to live whether
one wants to or not.

218
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:46,040
Look at me. Your Dad is no more.

219
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,904
Am l not alive?

220
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:55,541
Son, now l live only for you.

221
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:57,986
Even l only live for you mother.

222
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:00,621
And after me?

223
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,786
Don't say this early in the morning!

224
00:32:04,694 --> 00:32:09,461
Okay. You are sensible.
You're also my son.

225
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:13,594
lf you live for me
then listen to me.

226
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:15,670
lsn't it?

227
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:20,367
Come here.

228
00:32:44,668 --> 00:33:00,505
Book a first class ticket to
Zurich and prepare the visa papers.

229
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,276
This should be done soon.

230
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,010
ln which name should the ticket be?

231
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:11,554
Are you going out?

232
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:14,158
There's a conference.
Have to go for 10-12 days.

233
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:16,394
Can you answer one question?

234
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,467
After seeing you home last night
why did l feel you were no stranger?

235
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:25,567
There can be one reason for that.

236
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:31,914
When you meet the first time,
you are strangers.

237
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:40,849
Sometimes l see the shadows of
my sorrow in your eyes.

238
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:52,261
l feel in today's world,
every man is lonely.

239
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:56,602
He wants a companion, a destination.

240
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:00,668
Yesterday this town was new to me

241
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:04,874
And after spending some time
in your house l felt...

242
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:08,741
That l have somebody in this city.

243
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,180
l know nothing about your life.

244
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:19,687
My name is Chandni Mathur.

245
00:34:20,964 --> 00:34:24,525
l have completed B.A.
l work in Hansa Travel Agency.

246
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:29,569
After that life has come to a halt.

247
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:32,473
lt's better if life goes on.

248
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,485
l've been waiting
for you since ages.

249
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:54,062
We're having our office annual
party l want your contribution.

250
00:34:59,002 --> 00:35:03,769
Here are 100 rupees.
You'll remember me!

251
00:43:02,451 --> 00:43:04,112
How long will you deceive yourself?

252
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:09,051
You live for her memories.
You still feel warm with her breath!

253
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:13,085
Her fragrance, the glow in her
still exists within yourself.

254
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:16,530
Not one moment goes by
when you haven't thought of her!

255
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:20,196
To hear her voice you call
her up in the nights!

256
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:24,369
Your heart beats only
because of her memories!

257
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:27,470
You are right.

258
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:30,835
She is still my life.

259
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,648
My heart beat, my love.

260
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:40,749
- But today... - Even today
she'll come running back to you!

261
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:43,592
Yes!

262
00:43:47,363 --> 00:43:50,628
l remember when l first met her.

263
00:43:52,034 --> 00:43:53,126
l went to call her.

264
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:56,133
l'd swept her off her feet.

265
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,665
l want to do the same today.

266
00:44:02,044 --> 00:44:03,773
l want to get well.

267
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:06,539
l want to get better.

268
00:44:13,189 --> 00:44:15,885
Whatever you want will be done.

269
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,152
Don't worry. l'll call the
hospital in Switzerland.

270
00:45:19,488 --> 00:45:20,716
Did you talk to Chandni?

271
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:24,318
- Not yet.
- Why not?

272
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:27,721
- What's the hurry?
- l'm in a hurry not you.

273
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,597
l've waited enough.
lf you won't ask her, l will.

274
00:45:32,334 --> 00:45:37,397
Mother these days
you behave like a child.

275
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:40,439
l tell you l'll ring up
and call her just now.

276
00:45:40,776 --> 00:45:43,244
And ask her when she'll
come here as a bride.

277
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:48,146
l'll ask her soon as l return

278
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:50,409
No, today and just now!

279
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:54,179
- You are blackmailing me!
- So be it.

280
00:45:55,691 --> 00:46:01,527
Okay. l'll ask her as soon as
l get a chance at the party.

281
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:26,447
Aren't you dancing?

282
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:30,256
l can't dance.

283
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:32,654
But why aren't you dancing?

284
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:36,058
lf l say l too can't dance?

285
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:38,796
Then l'll believe it.

286
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:41,594
There's one thing common in us.

287
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:44,569
Both of us lie well.

288
00:46:45,441 --> 00:46:46,806
Another thing in common.

289
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,604
Both of us talk well.

290
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,009
Then let's go and talk.

291
00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:59,714
l'll win in talking.

292
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:01,986
How can you say that?

293
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:07,391
Looking at you l feel
either you don't have a tongue..

294
00:47:07,663 --> 00:47:10,097
Or it has become silent
after talking too much.

295
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:20,565
- My mother is very fond of you.
- Even l like her a lot.

296
00:47:22,177 --> 00:47:28,116
- Meet her in my absence.
She'll like that. - So would l.

297
00:47:34,623 --> 00:47:38,457
There's a desire in my heart.

298
00:47:39,295 --> 00:47:43,322
- Just name the desire.
- l am frightened.

299
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:45,494
Why sir?

300
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:49,037
Because l maybe turned down.

301
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:05,545
l wish you could come with me.

302
00:48:07,056 --> 00:48:11,425
To the airport. To see me off.

303
00:48:12,261 --> 00:48:18,666
That's all? l was feeling generous
today. You'd have got anything at all.

304
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,704
l'd only want you to be happy.

305
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:30,078
Because you spread joy
wherever you go.

306
00:48:32,615 --> 00:48:33,980
Don't curse me sir.

307
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:37,451
l'm frightened of my joys.

308
00:48:38,754 --> 00:48:43,157
lt is said the moonlight
remains for only 4 days.

309
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:48,387
l wish l could prove
this saying wrong.

310
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:51,426
l'll change this saying
if l get the opportunity.

311
00:48:55,638 --> 00:49:00,075
lt's time for your flight.
l'll see you to the airport.

312
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:04,444
Stay here and look after the
staff. Chandni will drop me.

313
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:09,951
Here one gets the feeling
that everyone is leaving the country

314
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:11,808
You too come with me.

315
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:16,117
l mean it.

316
00:49:20,763 --> 00:49:23,288
Why do you think like that?

317
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:26,968
l've seen life closely.

318
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,302
l have a name.

319
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:38,779
- l'll have to muster up
some courage. - Then do it.

320
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,219
Without the formality.

321
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:48,921
That will take some time.

322
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:59,492
What shall l get for you?

323
00:50:00,569 --> 00:50:02,093
Just get back.

324
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:10,338
- l don't need anything in life.
- But still...

325
00:50:10,979 --> 00:50:14,847
All right. Eiffel Tower from
Paris, Big Ben from London.

326
00:50:15,184 --> 00:50:16,947
And Statue of Liberty
from New York

327
00:50:18,053 --> 00:50:21,784
There's no place in
my suitcase for all these!

328
00:50:26,662 --> 00:50:29,688
Will you miss me?

329
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:35,532
l... you...

330
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,400
At least try.

331
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:49,077
Your flight has been announced.

332
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:22,580
You still haven't told me your choice

333
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:26,952
My choice? What can l say?

334
00:51:28,157 --> 00:51:29,749
l want to know your choice.

335
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:34,451
l am sure your choice
will be the same as my son's.

336
00:51:41,503 --> 00:51:44,563
lf you take so long to buy
one thing, l will...

337
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:48,102
l have lots of shopping to do.

338
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,305
l want to buy a sari for you.

339
00:51:50,746 --> 00:51:53,078
For me? No, mother...please.

340
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:57,207
lf you don't listen to me,
you'll get a thrashing.

341
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:36,221
- On vacation?
- No, business conference.

342
00:52:37,025 --> 00:52:40,358
- And you?
- Treatment.

343
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:44,922
Hearing one's mother tongue
abroad feels very good.

344
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:47,402
One misses one's country abroad.

345
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:51,034
And one's countrymen.

346
00:52:52,074 --> 00:52:53,234
Are you here since long?

347
00:52:53,575 --> 00:52:57,375
lts 4 months and 10 days.

348
00:52:57,946 --> 00:53:01,848
But it feels like a century.

349
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:04,883
Have you left somebody behind?

350
00:53:05,387 --> 00:53:10,381
Think of it like this,
l've left my life behind.

351
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,556
Let's do one thing. Today we have
the time and the weather is with us.

352
00:53:16,965 --> 00:53:20,264
Let's hear from and tell
each other about ourselves.

353
00:53:24,006 --> 00:53:25,496
From where do l begin?

354
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:30,606
When l fell in love,
my life was full of happiness!

355
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,879
We broke all shackles,
even got engaged.

356
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:40,481
- Then?
- The relation ended.

357
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,650
l ended the relation.

358
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,426
l don't understand.

359
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:49,397
l met with an accident.

360
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:52,326
l became a cripple.

361
00:53:53,001 --> 00:53:56,732
My life was ruined. Why spoil hers?

362
00:53:57,472 --> 00:53:59,770
That is why l broke the relation.

363
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:05,138
Now l wait for the moment
when we will confront each other.

364
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:08,380
Time will stand still.

365
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:14,520
Tell me about yourself.

366
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,392
My story is of few words.

367
00:54:21,396 --> 00:54:26,459
The first love they say,
can never be forgotten.

368
00:54:27,402 --> 00:54:35,036
Even today when l shut my eyes,
l feel her lashes on my face.

369
00:54:36,712 --> 00:54:43,174
But there were very few moments
of joy destined in my life.

370
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,656
She fell so sick that
she never recovered.

371
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:53,658
After her, l forgot to smile.

372
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:56,360
l forgot to live.

373
00:54:57,799 --> 00:54:59,494
l even lost the will to live.

374
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:04,662
But again the desire
to live has been awakened.

375
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:08,634
A girl has entered my life.

376
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:12,279
Life seems good.

377
00:55:13,515 --> 00:55:18,953
How do you feel when you see a ray
of light after ink jet darkness?

378
00:55:19,955 --> 00:55:22,253
l can understand.

379
00:55:23,225 --> 00:55:25,022
Tell me who the girl is.

380
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:31,863
You started it. First you tell me.

381
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:30,856
You could say it's the result of
somebody's love and prayers.

382
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,329
- When do you get back?
- Come to Bombay on 28th.

383
01:00:35,704 --> 01:00:38,867
- Don't tell the family.
- Okay, l'll come.

384
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,506
- How far has your love reached?
- l haven't even said l love you.

385
01:00:44,245 --> 01:00:47,510
Live in the jet age
and couldn't do this?

386
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:52,148
ln the olden days,
flowers did the trick.

387
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:54,717
But these days ''l love
you'' doesn't work

388
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:58,116
Buy her a gift.

389
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,723
The more expensive the gift,
the easier it is to say, l love you.

390
01:01:20,081 --> 01:01:22,845
- Take this.
- What is it?

391
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:26,120
lt's not a tip,
but to say l love you.

392
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:28,546
There's a pay phone there.
Go and call her up.

393
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:31,821
Time waits for none my friend.

394
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:35,128
Before time changes its' mood,
go and tell her you love her.

395
01:01:35,497 --> 01:01:38,625
And call her to the airport.
Let me also see your choice.

396
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:58,547
Can you guess who this is?

397
01:01:59,954 --> 01:02:02,650
l recognize your voice.

398
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:05,391
Doesn't my voice convey something?

399
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:12,327
- Where are you calling from?
- You're evading the topic.

400
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,328
From Geneva airport.

401
01:02:17,205 --> 01:02:22,939
- When will you get back?
- Today. The flight is almost due.

402
01:02:23,645 --> 01:02:25,636
Tell her you love her! Come on!

403
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:29,407
l have something important to tell you

404
01:02:30,385 --> 01:02:35,015
- We can talk when you return.
- l may not be able to say it then.

405
01:02:39,894 --> 01:02:43,694
- Don't feel shy. Tell her.
- l will.

406
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:49,495
- Whom are you talking to?
- l've found a friend. Very dear.

407
01:02:50,104 --> 01:02:55,804
- You'll like him.
- l'd be happy to meet your friend.

408
01:02:56,644 --> 01:02:58,475
He wants to partake in our joy.

409
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:03,514
What are you talking about?

410
01:03:04,085 --> 01:03:06,144
That's why l called you.

411
01:03:17,432 --> 01:03:20,731
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

412
01:03:24,906 --> 01:03:30,208
The flight has been announced.
l want you to meet me at the airport.

413
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:37,314
- Will you come to the airport?
- Yes.

414
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:50,255
l told her! l love you!

415
01:03:50,732 --> 01:03:54,600
And do you know she'll be at
the airport to receive me!

416
01:03:56,504 --> 01:03:58,028
So even l get to see
who has made your life!

417
01:03:59,774 --> 01:04:04,074
Your job is done.
But mine is annoyed with me.

418
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:10,509
lf things go well, we'll make a
foursome. We meet with our dates.

419
01:04:32,073 --> 01:04:35,634
l'm Chandni. l want to talk to Rohit

420
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,905
How dare you call here!

421
01:04:38,346 --> 01:04:40,314
Aren't you satisfied
by ruining our house?

422
01:04:40,882 --> 01:04:42,213
l want to talk to Rohit.

423
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,511
Don't you dare take his name!

424
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:47,354
You'll deal with me
if you dare call again!

425
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:04,832
Why didn't you go to the airport?

426
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:09,509
- Purposely.
- You don't want to forget your past

427
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:14,078
What has this love
you talk about given you?

428
01:05:14,515 --> 01:05:17,541
Unhappiness, problems.

429
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:24,289
Has he ever turned round
and asked you... just once...

430
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:30,425
How are you Chandni?
Are you alive or dead?

431
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:36,403
How long will you live like a
living corpse for this hollow love?

432
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:38,832
How long will you live like this?

433
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:45,610
And his family..!
Do you have that strength?

434
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,478
To go through another
ordeal by fire?

435
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,350
Hear their taunts, abuses!

436
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:56,389
Learn to look life in the eyes!

437
01:05:58,126 --> 01:06:02,927
Rohit was your past,
Lalit is your present.

438
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:15,066
Just a minute. Do you have
lndian currency, 50 paise?

439
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:32,126
Chandni hasn't come.

440
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:47,637
- Why is nobody picking it up?
- l too will call up.

441
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:07,127
- What's the matter?
- Nobody is picking the phone.

442
01:07:07,595 --> 01:07:08,459
Mine is engaged.

443
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:18,496
Won't you say anything?

444
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:23,336
l've forgotten everything
on seeing you.

445
01:07:29,016 --> 01:07:35,580
l pray to God to give you a
long life and fulfill your dreams.

446
01:07:40,461 --> 01:07:45,899
Meet him. He is Lalit.
Two friends but one heart.

447
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,133
And he's my brother-in-law.

448
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:57,544
- Mother!
- Felt like seeing you so l came.

449
01:07:58,146 --> 01:08:02,139
This is Rohit. Think of him
as your younger son.

450
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:07,921
- And this is his brother-in-law.
- Good day.

451
01:08:08,689 --> 01:08:10,520
Okay, l'll take leave.

452
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:14,492
Don't forget about the meeting.

453
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:21,127
- How was your trip?
- Very good.

454
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:24,638
Did you talk to her?

455
01:08:31,179 --> 01:08:33,773
lt's great that you left home.

456
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:36,776
After this trip you're really flying!

457
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:40,821
- Chandni was to come?
- Must be feeling shy.

458
01:08:41,222 --> 01:08:44,658
What shame? We'll land up
with our bag and baggage!

459
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:46,653
Does she know you're coming?

460
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:49,757
lnforming reduces the romance.

461
01:08:50,198 --> 01:08:52,189
l want to give her a surprise.

462
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:58,197
- First ask her. - What for?
Just tell her to call her parents.

463
01:08:58,573 --> 01:09:01,701
Before the family lands up,
let's organize the wedding.

464
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:04,441
l can't wait for the wedding!

465
01:09:05,012 --> 01:09:09,073
What is auspicious day?
Every day is auspicious.

466
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:12,451
The day Chandni marries you
will be an auspicious day.

467
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:15,514
The day she'll be mine is auspicious!

468
01:09:15,857 --> 01:09:17,825
- Did she come to meet you?
- Everyday.

469
01:09:18,192 --> 01:09:20,422
- How is she?
- See for yourself.

470
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:22,795
We've done a lot
of shopping for you.

471
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:25,463
- Shopped a lot?
- What else did l do?

472
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,234
l've even bought the
ring she'd returned.

473
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:29,968
This ring is for her.

474
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:35,867
- Very pretty.
- Watch and perfumes.

475
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:40,677
- For me?
- Your daughter-in-law.

476
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,181
First tell me why you
didn't come to the airport?

477
01:09:44,886 --> 01:09:45,910
Just like that.

478
01:09:47,922 --> 01:09:50,618
What's the matter?

479
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,022
l want to talk to you.

480
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,725
You've told me everything
about yourself.

481
01:10:02,603 --> 01:10:06,232
But you know nothing about me.

482
01:10:07,108 --> 01:10:09,269
l don't want to know.

483
01:10:11,145 --> 01:10:13,409
l have a past.

484
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:17,813
l have also loved somebody.

485
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:25,724
l don't want to know
about your past.

486
01:10:26,227 --> 01:10:27,592
But ...

487
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:32,799
l want to tell you something.

488
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:37,702
Don't know why l'm scared.

489
01:10:38,606 --> 01:10:41,074
What is it?

490
01:10:42,343 --> 01:10:48,179
What my eyes kept telling but
my tongue couldn't dare.

491
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:56,288
l want to marry you.

492
01:11:01,128 --> 01:11:02,060
Are you angry?

493
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:09,628
- No.
- Are you willing?

494
01:11:14,308 --> 01:11:17,835
Yes.

495
01:11:20,147 --> 01:11:23,446
You don't know how
happy you've made me!

496
01:11:24,318 --> 01:11:28,277
And mother too will be thrilled.

497
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:34,284
l've never seen Lali so happy.

498
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:37,493
lt looks as if he's
got the full world!

499
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:42,469
l gave birth to him but
you've given him a new life!

500
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,067
l've be forever obliged.

501
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:49,465
l want his life to be
filled with happiness!

502
01:11:49,877 --> 01:11:52,038
And l trust you completely.

503
01:11:52,346 --> 01:11:54,473
You'll keep him very happy!

504
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,981
What will happen to me!

505
01:12:00,855 --> 01:12:03,449
l'm very nervous!

506
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,983
See how l'm sweating!

507
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:11,957
What will she say on seeing me?
Will l be able to say a word?

508
01:12:14,301 --> 01:12:17,464
l might faint on seeing her!

509
01:12:17,805 --> 01:12:20,467
lt's also probable that she might
faint with joy on seeing you!

510
01:12:56,077 --> 01:12:58,477
What are you staring at? lt's me.

511
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:05,778
Not a ghost but your
very own live Rohit.

512
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:11,783
You're looking good.

513
01:13:15,396 --> 01:13:18,991
Dazed? Shall l show you some magic?

514
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:31,170
Shocked out of your wits?
Extraordinarily amazed?

515
01:13:32,113 --> 01:13:33,876
Look carefully!

516
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:38,040
l can dance, turn around.

517
01:13:38,285 --> 01:13:40,583
l can do sit-ups, l can dance!

518
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:44,985
So how is it?

519
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:51,357
Ask me in.

520
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:03,265
You've forgotten me.

521
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:07,878
You never thought about me,
whether l'm alive or not.

522
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,678
This is where you were wrong.

523
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:15,146
People in love do not die.

524
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:20,353
lf love exists in their hearts..

525
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:25,927
No power, no pain can separate them.

526
01:14:27,735 --> 01:14:29,202
Honestly...

527
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:35,706
Just the thought of seeing you,
the desire to meet you...

528
01:14:36,076 --> 01:14:37,907
Gave me the strength to get well.

529
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:43,680
lt saved me. l stand before you
only because of your love.

530
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:50,589
l swear by you if l've ever
been away from you for a moment.

531
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:53,884
lf a moment went by
without me thinking of you.

532
01:14:55,029 --> 01:15:01,025
l've been cheated once.

533
01:15:01,402 --> 01:15:06,567
But not again. Ramesh and l
have arranged our wedding.

534
01:15:07,274 --> 01:15:11,108
And before there are any other
obstacles let's get married.

535
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:13,570
Yes or no?

536
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:22,613
You're not saying anything.
l didn't give you a chance.

537
01:15:23,324 --> 01:15:27,090
Tell me something about yourself.

538
01:15:27,328 --> 01:15:31,025
You must have cried for me.
Cursed and abused me.

539
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:35,700
Say something.

540
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:42,102
What do l say?

541
01:15:49,683 --> 01:15:55,121
The phone is ringing.
Not used to attending it?

542
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:58,485
l kept calling from the airport.
Nobody attended to it.

543
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:05,390
Lalit here.

544
01:16:09,136 --> 01:16:10,569
You like the rain don't you?

545
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,840
lt's raining outside
so l thought of you.

546
01:16:17,945 --> 01:16:21,711
Look at the rain fall in the lawn,

547
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:27,081
You'll see the face dearest
to you in every falling drop.

548
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:30,921
Did you see? Can you see me?

549
01:16:34,962 --> 01:16:37,157
What miracle have you
worked on mother?

550
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:40,192
She's thrilled to bits!

551
01:16:43,804 --> 01:16:47,365
l told you l'd introduce you to a
pal of mine. We'll meet tomorrow.

552
01:17:09,697 --> 01:17:11,927
The rain here is wonderful.

553
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:16,101
What's the matter?

554
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:28,012
l hope in my absence you
haven't found a rival!

555
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:44,693
There's somebody else in my life.

556
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:48,267
l am marrying him.

557
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:03,875
What do you mean?

558
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:07,417
This is not possible!

559
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,623
You are only mine!

560
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:21,759
You can't punish me and yourself!
You can't punish our love!

561
01:18:22,302 --> 01:18:23,894
You can't belong to anybody else!

562
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:30,799
You were mine, you are mine
and you'll always remain mine!

563
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:33,904
Rohit's Chandni!

564
01:18:35,682 --> 01:18:41,314
Where was your Chandni
when you broke her heart?

565
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:46,826
When you insulted her love? Did you
ever try to find if l was alive?

566
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:51,295
How l spent each
moment since that day...

567
01:18:52,533 --> 01:18:54,467
Today again l ask you...

568
01:18:54,868 --> 01:18:57,200
What would you do in my place?

569
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:11,975
You are right. l have
given you a lot of pain.

570
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:16,883
l thought l could get you back
whenever l felt ready.

571
01:19:17,424 --> 01:19:19,051
l never thought you would..

572
01:19:22,729 --> 01:19:28,224
l've lost you once again.
This time it is forever.

573
01:19:29,703 --> 01:19:31,227
You be happy.

574
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:58,531
Tell me what happened.

575
01:20:01,235 --> 01:20:02,497
There's another man.

576
01:20:06,507 --> 01:20:08,737
- Do you know who he is?
- No.

577
01:20:10,377 --> 01:20:16,282
- Does he know about you?
- Don't know. lt's not his fault.

578
01:20:17,251 --> 01:20:20,084
His fault is he's
between both of you.

579
01:20:21,788 --> 01:20:25,280
l feel stifled in this city.

580
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:27,793
l'll return by the evening train.

581
01:20:28,228 --> 01:20:31,755
What? Won't you
wait for my wedding?

582
01:20:32,266 --> 01:20:34,962
l'm getting married in 2 days.
You have to attend it.

583
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:40,530
l won't listen to a word.
You will have to stay.

584
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:00,455
This is my fiancee.

585
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:05,194
My friend Rohit.
Won't you greet each other?

586
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:16,339
l asked him to stay for our
wedding. But he doesn't agree.

587
01:21:21,114 --> 01:21:23,639
lt's not his fault. He is sad.

588
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:28,387
The girl he loved is
marrying somebody else.

589
01:21:31,959 --> 01:21:34,951
But l won't like it if
he doesn't stay for our wedding.

590
01:21:36,597 --> 01:21:38,224
He might listen to you and stay.

591
01:21:43,337 --> 01:21:49,970
We would be happy if you
stayed for your friend's wedding.

592
01:21:53,747 --> 01:21:57,274
lf you want me l will stay.

593
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:19,461
You're not yet ready?

594
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:26,635
lt's my friend's wedding. Everybody
will watch when l get dressed!

595
01:22:26,913 --> 01:22:29,473
Everybody will watch the
drunken scene you'll create.

596
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:37,490
lf we'd get married together,
we'd have a real ball!

597
01:22:38,425 --> 01:22:42,361
lf not mine at least your wedding!

598
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:51,398
Sometimes l feel you're saying
something but l don't understand.

599
01:22:52,539 --> 01:22:53,836
Even l don't understand.

600
01:22:54,174 --> 01:22:58,042
They must be looking for
the groom downstairs.

601
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:01,637
- Go ahead.
- Come soon.

602
01:23:08,221 --> 01:23:12,590
Friend you punish me but
not give me the time.

603
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,159
You've become a scene!

604
01:23:35,382 --> 01:23:37,407
- What's wrong? Everybody
is waiting. - Come on.

605
01:24:56,596 --> 01:24:58,564
Save my Rohit!

606
01:24:59,366 --> 01:25:07,364
Save my Rohit! Or l will die!

607
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:13,305
Go and call the doctor!

608
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:21,413
Open your eyes! Call the doctor!

609
01:25:55,856 --> 01:25:57,915
ls everything all right?

610
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:01,025
The blood pressure and ECG are fine

611
01:26:01,428 --> 01:26:05,262
lt's a mild concussion.
He'll be fine in a day or two.

612
01:26:05,966 --> 01:26:07,024
No cause for worry.

613
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,871
People who love don't die.

614
01:26:17,911 --> 01:26:21,608
There's another man.

615
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:29,622
You are mine, only mine!
You can't belong to anybody else!

616
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:33,420
l also loved somebody.

617
01:26:37,697 --> 01:26:42,066
l want to marry you.

618
01:26:43,103 --> 01:26:45,298
But you know nothing about me.

619
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:49,568
Rohit was your past.
Lalit is your present!

620
01:26:50,076 --> 01:26:51,703
l like Chandni a lot.

621
01:26:52,112 --> 01:26:54,672
Seeing her, l have some dreams.

622
01:26:59,653 --> 01:27:03,145
l gave birth to him but
you gave him life!

623
01:27:03,957 --> 01:27:05,948
l'll be grateful forever.

624
01:27:11,097 --> 01:27:14,032
The day Chandni becomes
your wife will be auspicious.

625
01:27:28,715 --> 01:27:31,684
Vermilion adorns
your hair beautifully.

626
01:27:32,953 --> 01:27:35,046
ls the suite booked?
The honeymoon suite?

627
01:27:36,923 --> 01:27:40,689
Decorate the entire room with roses.

628
01:27:42,562 --> 01:27:45,122
There should be nothing lacking.

629
01:27:45,799 --> 01:27:48,199
One gets married just
once in his lifetime.

630
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,571
Two tickets, first class.

631
01:27:57,243 --> 01:28:01,009
What time is the flight?
lt's on time?

632
01:28:09,456 --> 01:28:12,550
l've never seen such a
beautiful bride in my life!

633
01:28:15,562 --> 01:28:17,359
Driver get the car.

634
01:28:19,032 --> 01:28:20,499
Keep the bags in the car.

635
01:28:23,636 --> 01:28:26,969
- Where are you? Not dressed?
- l'm ready since ages.

636
01:28:27,273 --> 01:28:29,867
Where will l go? l am here.

637
01:28:30,276 --> 01:28:31,504
lt's time for the flight.

638
01:28:31,845 --> 01:28:37,078
Where are you leaving me?
l'm also waiting in the flanks.

639
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:40,046
You take so long
dressing up like girls!

640
01:28:40,286 --> 01:28:42,186
Don't get hot. l'll change slowly.

641
01:28:43,623 --> 01:28:46,524
You're looking beautiful.

642
01:28:48,094 --> 01:28:51,291
Let's go. lt's getting late.

643
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,209
You've given me lots of love.

644
01:29:03,676 --> 01:29:06,076
Live long, be happy.

645
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:17,380
Mother l'm your other son.

646
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:21,458
- Don't forget me.
- Can a mother forget her child?

647
01:29:21,928 --> 01:29:23,725
You're my younger son.

648
01:29:37,277 --> 01:29:38,505
Go and be happy.

649
01:29:58,264 --> 01:30:01,893
Why did you do this son?

650
01:30:06,306 --> 01:30:08,831
Mother this was a compromise,
not love.

651
01:30:09,943 --> 01:30:12,309
And one can't live life
with a compromise.

652
01:30:15,215 --> 01:30:17,649
Maybe you're not fated the
joys of a daughter-in-law.

653
01:30:18,718 --> 01:30:23,519
And love is not in my destiny.
