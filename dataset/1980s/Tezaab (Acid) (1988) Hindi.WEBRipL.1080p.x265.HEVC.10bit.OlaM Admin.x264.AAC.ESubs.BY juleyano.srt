1
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,820
Who?
-

2
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,700
Who are you people?

3
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,580
What are you people doing in my
house at this time of the night?

4
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,580
Lotia Pathan has sent us.

5
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,700
Today was the last day
for you to repay the debt.

6
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,340
But you did not repay so
we have come to remind you.

7
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,940
Yes, there is no need to remind me.

8
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,300
When I have the money I'll repay it.

9
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:01,604
You had said that when
your daughter will start...

10
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,917
...dancing on the stage the
money will start showering.

11
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,866
She has already done
twenty five shows.

12
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,500
But you have not
paid us a single penny.

13
00:02:10,571 --> 00:02:12,691
Do not talk too much.
And get lost from here otherwise...

14
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,077
...I'll call the Police and...

15
00:02:16,885 --> 00:02:21,525
Listen Shyamlal, if by 12 o'clock
tomorrow the does not reach us...

16
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:26,053
...then remember we'll not spare you.

17
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,540
You are threatening me,
you scoundrels.

18
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,500
It is not a threat
but it is a warning.

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,940
And tomorrow this
threat will be carried out.

20
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,100
And we will not spare
you till your last breath.

21
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,260
Wow! Get on! Come on! 2... 3... Dip!

22
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,900
Hello! Oh! God! What
are you saying, daddy?

23
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,180
I've already given the number 1
and the number 2 money to you...

24
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,604
...and now you are demanding
50 thousand more?

25
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,220
Commitment is commitment, sir.

26
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,020
Krishnamurthy,
I do not know all that.

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,060
I am very frank, that if I don't get
50 thousand rupees...

28
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,420
...then Mohini will not
come for the rehearsal.

29
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,876
What are you saying, sir?
- What's the matter, Krishnamurthy?

30
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,580
You are looking quite hassled?
All is okay?

31
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:34,996
Sir, Shyamlal is demanding
50 thousand rupees more.

32
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,795
What? - And sir,
he is threatening to cancel the show.

33
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,580
Really?

34
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,940
Yes, Mr. Shyamlal,
now 50 thousand is nothing...

35
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,004
...in front of a great
artist like your daughter.

36
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:47,260
You can take it whenever you want.

37
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,620
This is absolute blackmail, sir.
- Shut up, Krishnamurthy!

38
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Is this the way to talk to
a man like Mr. Shyamlal?

39
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,420
You go and get 50 thousand rupees.

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,380
Mr. Shyamlal you bring Mohini to my
residence and I will pay you the...

41
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,060
...50 thousand rupees there itself.

42
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,340
Here are your 50 thousand rupees.

43
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:02,540
At least count the money.

44
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:05,747
Saxena, Shyamlal does
not do the duty of a clerk.

45
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,380
If it is more or less
then I swear by Kashi's Vishwanath...

46
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:09,956
...you will repent a lot.

47
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,260
Okay then, I will take your leave.

48
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:14,107
Oh! Mr. Shyamlal, how can go
without taking any drinks?

49
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,220
Let Mohini go to the rehearsals,
but you sit down with me.

50
00:04:17,477 --> 00:04:19,197
We will have a few drinks.

51
00:04:31,956 --> 00:04:33,076
I'll be right back.

52
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,060
Dear Mohini! Dear Mohini...

53
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,940
...you go to the
rehearsals and I'll just...

54
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
And you'll sit down
here drinking liquor...

55
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,149
...and I'll dance there.

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,260
If someone else had said this to me,
I'd have killed that person.

57
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,731
You cannot kill me.

58
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:54,124
Because your liquor,
your gambling and enjoyment...

59
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,740
...is all because of me.

60
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,733
I am your source of income, father...

61
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:01,716
...and you do not have
the guts to kill me.

62
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,940
Come on Saxena, give me the glass.
Wow! Cheers! - Cheers!

63
00:05:16,644 --> 00:05:18,724
- You scoundrel!

64
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:20,764
If you don't get the money then...

65
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,685
...Mohini will not come
for the show, is it?

66
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:23,988
Fifty thousand?

67
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,540
Lock up this old man.

68
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,108
And when the show starts throw him...

69
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:33,921
...backstage to hear
his daughter's song.

70
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:42,081
"Mohini! Mohini! Mohini! Mohini!
Mohini! Mohini!"

71
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,570
"Greetings!
- Greetings!"

72
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,090
"Tell me, what would you like to hear?"

73
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,842
"First you tell us,
where were you?"

74
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:14,547
"I? I was waiting for somebody."

75
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,555
"Who is it?"

76
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:21,930
"The one whom I love."
- "Oh! No!"

77
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:27,018
"And I plead with him again and again."
- "How?"

78
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:28,531
"Like this!"

79
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:05,435
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

80
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,810
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

81
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,730
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

82
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,010
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

83
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,810
"I wait for you..."

84
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,490
"I count the days, one
by one waiting for you."

85
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:24,762
"Come darling the
spring has come."

86
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,530
"I count the days, one
by one waiting for you."

87
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,890
"Come darling the
spring has come."

88
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:36,082
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

89
00:07:36,184 --> 00:07:39,210
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

90
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:43,173
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

91
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:46,395
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

92
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:15,362
"On the fourteenth day
I received your message."

93
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:18,882
"On the fourteenth day
I received your message."

94
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,604
"Said you'll come on
the fifteenth day."

95
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:26,092
"Neither did you come on the
fourteenth nor on the fifteenth."

96
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:29,482
"What did you gain
by torturing me?"

97
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,100
"On the sixteenth day too..."

98
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,459
"On the sixteenth day too...

99
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,035
...I'd adorned myself
with sixteen ornaments."

100
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,971
"Come darling the
spring has come."

101
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,210
"I count the days, one
by one waiting for you."

102
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:45,355
"Come darling the
spring has come."

103
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:49,834
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

104
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:53,042
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

105
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,186
"On the seventeenth day
I thought it was all over."

106
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:38,626
"On the eighteenth that
my heart was broken."

107
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:42,306
"I cried all day on the nineteen."

108
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:45,571
"On twentieth day the heart
was broken into twenty pieces."

109
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:47,546
"But still, no..."

110
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:51,281
"But still your love
did not go from my heart."

111
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:54,266
"Come darling the
spring has come."

112
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,290
"I count the days,
one by one waiting for you."

113
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:01,322
"Come darling the
spring has come."

114
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,730
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

115
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,010
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

116
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:55,072
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

117
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,000
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

118
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:00,019
"The days turned into weeks."

119
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,779
"The weeks turned into months."

120
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,130
"And the months
turned into years."

121
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:08,661
"You come and see for yourself."

122
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:12,012
"What is my state?"

123
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:15,606
"I am wandering
around like a crazy woman."

124
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:19,132
"Neither I am dead nor alive."

125
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:22,636
"In the lonely
nights I keep suffering."

126
00:11:22,755 --> 00:11:26,035
"Come, come, come, come, come."

127
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:30,253
"Come, I am counting the days."

128
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:35,812
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

129
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:38,907
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

130
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:42,827
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

131
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,796
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

132
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,140
"I count the days,
one by one waiting for you."

133
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:52,412
"Come darling the
spring has come."

134
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:56,117
"I count the days, one
by one waiting for you."

135
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:59,261
"Come darling the
spring has come."

136
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,280
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

137
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:06,558
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

138
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:10,357
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

139
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:13,455
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

140
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,219
Stop! Leave me, I said leave me.

141
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,284
Where did these goons come from?

142
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:48,707
Krishnamurthy, call the Police.

143
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:00,996
Leave me!

144
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,749
Brother Munna is coming.

145
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,595
Brother Munna is here.

146
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,770
Greetings, brother Munna.
- Greetings, brother Munna.

147
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,090
Greetings, brother Munna.

148
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,490
Greetings, brother!

149
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,577
Please sit here, brother Munna.

150
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,074
There was a Police raid at
Patil's den but still I could save...

151
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,490
...this material and come.

152
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,602
This is your share for today.

153
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,594
Today in the entire
day I could sell only ...

154
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:26,771
150 bottles, brother Munna,
that is why...

155
00:15:29,418 --> 00:15:32,258
You know it is the end of
the month so nobody comes...

156
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:35,345
...to play three cards game.

157
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,572
The distance between your
life and death is not more...

158
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:54,116
...than the width of the
sharp edge of Munna's dagger.

159
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:57,107
If you ever tell a lie again...

160
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,436
...then you won't have any hands to
deal the cards with.

161
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:02,890
Come on, stand straight.

162
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:04,666
You jerk, Munna
does take money but...

163
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,250
...he also saves us from
all other hassles too.

164
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,890
Come on hurry up. Do not waste time.

165
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,130
I have to go to report
to the Police Station.

166
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,299
Hey you, Pakya!
You all are still here.

167
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,194
Are you all on strike or the
railways has gone on a strike?

168
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,562
Come here.
You are bruised very badly.

169
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,290
Were you involved in a fight?
- I'll tell you, brother Munna.

170
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:30,834
A new gang is operating in our area.

171
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:34,489
They roam in the Hanuman Lane near
the station and they rob your goods.

172
00:16:34,546 --> 00:16:36,626
The same gang bashed up
Toped very badly and...

173
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,370
...snatched away all the
money from that poor fellow.

174
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,513
Whose gang is it?

175
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,139
There's a man called Mukut Bihari.

176
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:42,713
He has come from some other
town after committing a murder.

177
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,090
He is their leader.

178
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,130
Do you know their whereabouts?

179
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,065
No, I could not see
their faces in the dark.

180
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,330
And nowadays the Dandiya
 dance of the...

181
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,530
...'Navratri' festival is
on at the Hanuman Lane.

182
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,354
So it is very difficult to recognize
anyone in so much of a crowd.

183
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,250
Dandiya!

184
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,140
Hey! Come here.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:29,756
Give me the yellow ice-cream.

186
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:44,044
Papa! Papa!! My ear.

187
00:17:44,124 --> 00:17:45,364
What happened? Oh! No!
Somebody has snatched...

188
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:47,692
...away my daughter's ear ring.
Please help. Catch him! Catch him!

189
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:51,364
What happened? - Oh! No!
My daughter is bleeding profusely.

190
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:53,021
Somebody has snatched
her ear ring. Look around.

191
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:54,012
Oh! No! Where is my bag?

192
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:55,997
Where is my bag?
There was my salary in it.

193
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,085
He looks like a very rich man.

194
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:28,644
If this intoxicated man keeps
throwing around all his money...

195
00:19:28,716 --> 00:19:30,236
...then we will incur a big loss.

196
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:12,380
Is it all over?
- Yes.

197
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,300
It is done for the night?
- Yes.

198
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:17,484
Either come to some
other place for Dandiya...

199
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,780
...or everybody go home.
- Let's go.

200
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,020
"Oh! I've forgotten
my paternal home."

201
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,140
"I'm in love with
my husband's house."

202
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:50,860
"Oh! I've... Oh! I've forgotten
my paternal home."

203
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,740
Who is Mukut Bihari amongst you?

204
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,708
He is not drunk at all.

205
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,210
To bring cowards like
you out of your hideouts...

206
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:04,108
...I have many more ideas.

207
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,980
Who is Mukut Bihari amongst you all?

208
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,620
Oh! So you want Mukut Bihari, right?

209
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,220
Hey Rashid! Give him the
address of Mukut Bihari.

210
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:34,203
Try once again.

211
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,260
Now I'll make you dance the Dandiya.

212
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Now tell me,
why were you looking for me?

213
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,940
Mukut Bihari, you silently
transfer your ration card from here.

214
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,778
And you should not be seen
here after this morning.

215
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:46,555
Oh! Child, in my ration card
there are 12 murders registered.

216
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,506
How many? Twelve.

217
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,500
And the thirteenth will be yours
and then your thirteenth day...

218
00:22:57,051 --> 00:23:00,691
Oh! Munna, you should've
come with some dangerous weapon.

219
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,100
Now listen carefully to what
I've to say, Mukut Bihari.

220
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:12,643
Otherwise, you'll not be
capable of hearing anymore.

221
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,540
Tell them to throw
down their weapons.

222
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,580
Whatever you've looted in my area.

223
00:23:28,191 --> 00:23:29,562
Here it is, brother.

224
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:35,971
Come on! Walk ahead. Come on.

225
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,580
No acting smart.

226
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,700
Look there is brother Munna!
- Brother Munna is here.

227
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,700
Brother Munna has come.

228
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:50,875
Stop. Looks like their train has arrived.
-

229
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,146
Pakya, come on get onto it.
- I'll go right now, brother Munna.

230
00:24:00,955 --> 00:24:02,475
Come on.

231
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,620
Now put them in the
Buffaloes' compartment.

232
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,020
And sent them to their
home town and how...?

233
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:12,164
As wedding guests.
- Yes. Come on.

234
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,380
Be careful.
After all they are our guests.

235
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,380
Come on shove them in. Oh! Oh!

236
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,890
All the purses and the wallets
that are in this bag return them.

237
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,858
Brother Munna!
- What is it?

238
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,467
There is a telegram for you.

239
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,220
Brother Munna,
please come home quickly.

240
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:56,731
There is a very big problem.

241
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,411
60 men, 16 women and
40 children are injured.

242
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:02,283
3 persons were killed
and 4 2 shops were looted.

243
00:25:02,386 --> 00:25:03,786
And till date our police
force has not been able to find...

244
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,980
...out who they were.

245
00:25:05,114 --> 00:25:07,074
We could only find out
that it was a gang of a...

246
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,643
...dangerous criminal named Lotia.

247
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,403
He is already wanted by the Police.

248
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:12,043
But where has he taken Mohini...

249
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,300
...we could not find out at all.

250
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:15,219
The motorcycles which were
apprehended from there...

251
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,660
...did you find out about their owners?

252
00:25:16,802 --> 00:25:18,722
Sir, all those
motorcycles were stolen.

253
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:21,163
Sir, we've received a
message on the wireless.

254
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,851
A banished criminal has
entered our city limits.

255
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,620
Who is he?
- His name is Munna.

256
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,860
He was banished
from here a year ago.

257
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,154
This is his file.

258
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,443
He is Mahesh Deshmukh!

259
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,200
How did he become Munna?

260
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,600
Sir, he is known as
Munna in this area.

261
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,360
Before this he has served a years jail
for committing a murder.

262
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,128
The file says that he
is a dangerous criminal.

263
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:54,128
But my memory says that he
was an innocent, sentimental...

264
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,080
...but a zestful young man,
who was even ready to die for his country.

265
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,008
Do you know him, sir?
-

266
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,520
I knew him. Two years ago
I was posted at Nasik.

267
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,920
A bank was situated in the deserted
lane opposite to my police station.

268
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,960
Both his parents
were employed there.

269
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,960
I still remember that day
when I met Mahesh for the first time.

270
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,920
Daddy!

271
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:25,304
Daddy, I had told you that
I'll win the best Navy Cadet's Cup...

272
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,921
...and show you. Look at this.

273
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,311
The best Navy Cadet Cup?

274
00:26:28,368 --> 00:26:30,008
Yes mother,
the best Navy Cadet's Cup.

275
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,688
I've done it dad, I've done it.

276
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,777
My dear son, I am proud of you.

277
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:38,272
Mother!
- Bless you son.

278
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,120
Inspector, our son Mahesh.

279
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:41,584
Congratulations!
- Mr. Deshmukh...

280
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,185
...now you'll have to give us sweets.

281
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:45,265
Your son has fulfilled
your heart's desire.

282
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:49,495
Yes my desire is fulfilled now
let Mahesh's dream come true.

283
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:50,896
What do you want to become Mahesh?

284
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,736
I want to join the Navy,
sir and become an Admiral.

285
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:55,551
Is it? That's very good.

286
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I don't know what has taken over him.
Since his childhood...

287
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:01,431
...he has always been
talking of serving the country.

288
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,544
Definitely he must've been a
freedom fighter in his previous birth...

289
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,560
...who become a Martyr.

290
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,440
Mahesh, I am very happy to meet you.

291
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,560
Wish you all the best.

292
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:11,536
Thank you, sir.
- Bye! Bye! Deshmukh.

293
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:14,809
Bye. I had promised you that
I'll buy a bicycle for you?

294
00:27:14,951 --> 00:27:16,231
Here is the money.

295
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,760
Thank you daddy,
thank you very much.

296
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,960
Ok. Mother, I'll leave now.

297
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,736
I'll see you at home at night.
- Yes.

298
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:40,361
Beware! I'll shoot everyone!

299
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:48,312
Give me the safe keys
you old man, you scoundrel!

300
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:50,961
I will not give you the keys.

301
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:53,304
Why do you want to invite your death,
come on give them to me.

302
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,080
Look here, I am working
here since the last 20 years.

303
00:27:57,624 --> 00:28:00,144
It is my duty to
protect their money.

304
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:04,256
And I don't care even if I lose
my life in carrying out my duty.

305
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:33,984
That woman is going
inside the bank, sir.

306
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,000
And she also has a
small child with her.

307
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,760
Their life could be in danger sir.

308
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,360
You do one thing, you go from here.

309
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,592
And if on the way you meet
the Police then send them here.

310
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,689
Sir, my mother
and father are also trapped inside...

311
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
...and I should go from here?

312
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,111
Look, they are armed with guns.

313
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:50,417
They can shoot at anytime.

314
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,256
And your life could be
in danger, understood?

315
00:28:53,104 --> 00:28:56,344
Why is it that only the
uniformed forces have the right...

316
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,760
...to fight against crime and
cruelty, and not us, sir? Why sir?

317
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,440
By the way I had written off
my name for the sake of...

318
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:05,304
...my country the day
when I wore this uniform.

319
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,680
Sir, it is very necessary
to stop that woman and...

320
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:10,057
...her child from going inside the bank.

321
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,680
If the dacoits see your
uniform they might start shooting.

322
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:14,872
I'll go and bring back that woman.

323
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:19,359
Sir, you order me. Sir! Please sir!
Please try to understand, sir!

324
00:29:19,449 --> 00:29:21,489
Please sir. Give me the order.
Time is running out, sir.

325
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:23,266
Sir, order me. Give me the orders.
Please sir, please.

326
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,647
Ok. You may go.

327
00:29:34,944 --> 00:29:36,344
Please, give it to me.

328
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,880
May God bless you!
- Ma'am...

329
00:29:37,936 --> 00:29:39,376
Otherwise the youngsters these days.
- I want to tell you...

330
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,416
They do not bother to respect elders.
- Please listen to...

331
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,040
My Child!

332
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:03,144
My Child!

333
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,640
Move away...!

334
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,810
Please somebody save my child.
Please save my child.

335
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,221
Take this, sir!
-

336
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:24,032
Mother.

337
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,800
My mother.

338
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:29,976
What have they done!

339
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:37,911
Sir. Look sir,
what they did to my mother?

340
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,096
Mahesh.

341
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:44,969
Father.
- Mahesh.

342
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,632
Inspector. Take him to hospital.

343
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,919
No, son. I don't have that much time.

344
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:01,528
If you want to do something
for me then fulfill my dreams.

345
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:04,304
You dream has become my dream.

346
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:08,601
Father. I will be very lonely without you.
- No, son.

347
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:13,728
The entire country is with you.

348
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,200
Take care of Jyoti.
- Father.

349
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:28,401
'The happiest day in Mahesh's life...'

350
00:33:28,912 --> 00:33:31,552
'...had become the most sorrowful day
in just a few moments.'

351
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,240
'I've never seen life playing
a bigger joke than this...'

352
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:36,048
'...with anyone before.'

353
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:40,288
Mahesh went to Mumbai
along with his sister.

354
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:43,401
But after that day I felt
that my power of tolerating...

355
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:46,528
...pain has increased.

356
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,850
Anyway, search every
nook and corner of the city.

357
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,210
And block all the roads
going out of the city.

358
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,970
It is very important for me
that this man is arrested.

359
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:06,522
Because I want to know how did
he become Munna from Mahesh.

360
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,130
Jyoti.
- Brother...!

361
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,947
Brother...!
- Jyoti.

362
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,314
Jyoti.

363
00:34:57,122 --> 00:34:58,442
What has happened?

364
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,850
What happened?

365
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:08,114
Has Lotia harassed you?
- No.

366
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,730
I am seeing you after
one year that is why.

367
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,930
Jyoti, there are four more days to
go before one year is completed.

368
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:24,410
I still have the stigma
of 'Banished' on myself.

369
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,450
And the Police are
hunting me like dogs.

370
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,770
And you are aware that
until I serve my sentence...

371
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,426
...I cannot come back to Mumbai.

372
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:39,099
Tell me, why have you called me?

373
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:40,185
For Mohini.

374
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,450
What has happened to Mohini?

375
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,370
Lotia Pathan's goons
have kidnapped her.

376
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,810
Then what should I do?

377
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:59,626
Who else can I tell if not you
to free Mohini from Lotia Pathan?

378
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,810
There are millions
of girls in his city.

379
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:03,674
I have not taken
everybody's responsibility.

380
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,626
But Mohini was the only
one amongst them who had...

381
00:36:05,699 --> 00:36:08,059
...helped you in saving my honour.

382
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:10,865
Look Jyoti,
I am a banished criminal,...

383
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:13,121
...so I do not want to get
involved in any such thing.

384
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:16,362
This is the Police or
her father's job. Not mine.

385
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:20,266
So being her father he can
get her married to Saxena too.

386
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:22,754
Saxena? That theatre man?

387
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:25,554
Yes him. He wants to
get married to Mohini.

388
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,650
Let him marry,
she is not related to me or you.

389
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:30,387
As far as I am
concerned I have accepted...

390
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,163
...her as my sister-in-law.

391
00:36:32,675 --> 00:36:34,235
She cannot become your
sister-in- law.

392
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:36,434
Unless you don't
marry someone else or...

393
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:38,594
...she doesn't marry
someone else till then...

394
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,530
...I have given this right to Mohini.

395
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:42,123
And as far as you are concerned...

396
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,627
...look into my eyes and
tell me that...

397
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:46,273
...you don't have any relation
with Mohini.

398
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:48,371
Then you can go from here.

399
00:36:55,394 --> 00:36:59,834
Crazy! Go and bring a cup of tea for me.
- I will bring it just now.

400
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:01,818
Don't make me more furious, Saxena.

401
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,530
All this is because of you.
You are the root cause of all this.

402
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:07,666
Mohini is not going to come back
by blaming each other. - Leave it!

403
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:09,896
It is better that you
cool down Mr. Shyamlal and...

404
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,250
...think about Mohini's release.

405
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,410
We will find out some or the
other solution to this problem.

406
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,330
Shyamlal, the solution has
come to your door steps.

407
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:18,875
Lotia Pathan has imprisoned
your daughter in that place...

408
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,850
...where the crime is at its peak.

409
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,850
The police can't reach there but I can.

410
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:29,513
How can a young boy like you
lock horns with Lotia Pathan?

411
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:31,762
They will slash you and
throw you in the drainage.

412
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:35,626
Shyamlal, you have become so
blind in your selfishness...

413
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:37,602
...that you can't see your benefit.

414
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,394
My benefit! Listen to this!
He will be benefiting me.

415
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:44,314
Look Shyamlal, if I am not
able to bring your daughter...

416
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,458
...then think that one of
the thorn in your life...

417
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:47,763
...has gone out permanently.

418
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,306
Because you think
that Lotia and his men...

419
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:52,634
...will not allow me
to come back alive.

420
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,370
Yes, I think the same way.

421
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:57,425
And if I bring Mohini back...

422
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,730
...then you will get your daughter back.

423
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:03,794
Wow Saxena, wow! It is like
the story of the neighbour's son.

424
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:06,474
If he climbs on the tree,
then we will get mangoes to eat.

425
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,930
And if he falls down and
dies then we will get...

426
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,970
...the meal of the religious
ceremony after his death. Very good.

427
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:12,514
But what will you get by
endangering your life?

428
00:38:12,578 --> 00:38:14,818
I will get fifty thousand.
- Fifty thousand!

429
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:16,666
You are going to strike a
deal with me for my daughter.

430
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,019
You scoundrel! Go away from here, go.
- Think properly.

431
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,767
Wait!

432
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,250
I will pay you the money.

433
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:28,321
Mr. Shyamlal, everything will
come back if Mohini comes back.

434
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,090
What will come back, Saxena?

435
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,530
What if she refuses to dance?

436
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:33,362
I am ready to take
this responsibility.

437
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,890
I will pay your debt
and not only that...

438
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,050
...I will make arrangements for you
to stay luxuriously the whole life.

439
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:45,456
Look dear,
I don't understand one thing.

440
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,377
He wants money in
exchange of my daughter but...

441
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,930
...what do you want
in exchange of money?

442
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,130
Mohini.

443
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,170
If you give us the blessings.

444
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,610
Why not Saxena?
I swear upon Kashi Vishwanath...

445
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,602
If I get a good amount
then I am ready to...

446
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,650
...sell my blessings too. Yes!

447
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,450
Okay Munna, we accept your deal.

448
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,610
So brother, what will you have?

449
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,770
One 'handi biryani',
one 'dandi Kebab'...

450
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:21,322
...one liver and fish fry
and the rest...

451
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,250
I understood.
- I hope you have understood!

452
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,050
What will you have brother?
- An Ice cream along with 'Pulav'.

453
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:28,106
Chocolate Ice cream, isn't it?
- Yes.

454
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:32,105
And you brother.
- One 'Chicken tikka'...

455
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,328
...one chicken Tandoori
and one butter chicken.

456
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,650
So brothers, we require
720/- rupees to...

457
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,314
...celebrate Chandi's birthday.

458
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,890
Then do something,
my hair has started graying...

459
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,170
...because of empty stomach.
See this! - Yes, my friend!

460
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:48,825
Then give some of it,
everyone will be able to have food.

461
00:39:48,921 --> 00:39:51,801
Look at this! I have heard
that we find hair in food but...

462
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,490
...I have heard this
for the first time that...

463
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,370
...we will get food
because of the hair.

464
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,970
Do something quickly,
I am very hungry.

465
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,570
It seems that there is a party
in your destiny today, come.

466
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:15,944
Hey, clean the table over here.
- One minute!

467
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,098
Where are you going?
- To wash my hands.

468
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,426
Hey sit down! Clean it
with your neighbour's shirt.

469
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:24,049
But what if he
comes to know about it?

470
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,200
Did you come to know about it?
-

471
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,930
Don't make fun, I will beat you...

472
00:40:29,259 --> 00:40:32,370
These boys that you can see are mine.
Let them eat whatever they want.

473
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,530
I will pay the bill.
- No problem.

474
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,570
Hey waiter, come here!

475
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,530
Hey waiter, come here.
- Yes sir.

476
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,130
Bring one cup of tea fast with
less of water in it. Go. - Yes sir!

477
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,650
I saw it first.
- I too saw it.

478
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,610
We will share it.
- This is Mumbai.

479
00:41:28,826 --> 00:41:31,546
The one who has the note
is the owner of the note.

480
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,890
Okay, then this note should
go to the owner of the hotel.

481
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:40,306
Hey manager.
- Can't we compromise?

482
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,210
Compromise!

483
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:50,930
It is possible, just pay my bill.
- Yes, I will pay it.

484
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,770
Then it is okay.

485
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:59,787
Hey, move from here or
else all of you will...

486
00:41:59,866 --> 00:42:02,506
...have to wash utensils
on Chandi's birthday.

487
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:11,984
Manager, my uncle will pay the bill.

488
00:42:12,226 --> 00:42:14,426
What do you say uncle?
- Yes, I will pay the bill, let him go.

489
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:16,923
And uncle, don't leave it, catch it.

490
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:18,673
He loves me a lot.
- No problem.

491
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:24,633
This cock is very nice.
How much is the bill?

492
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:27,017
Hey Pandu, how much is the
total bill of all of them?

493
00:42:27,223 --> 00:42:28,946
Six chicken soups of
48/- rupees.

494
00:42:29,011 --> 00:42:32,211
Six vegetable 'Pulav',
Six chicken chilli.

495
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:36,554
Six 'Boti Masala',
six chicken special.

496
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:38,096
Twelve custard...

497
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:43,433
...and one fainted 'Marwadi'.

498
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:48,762
Today is okay but what
about tomorrow, bother?

499
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:52,338
There are many gullible
people wandering in this city.

500
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,923
We will get at least one in a day.

501
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:57,778
"The owner of the chickens,
save your chickens..."

502
00:42:57,835 --> 00:43:00,315
"The owner of the chickens,
save your chickens..."

503
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:03,243
Hey, this is Munna's cycle. Munna!

504
00:43:03,546 --> 00:43:06,866
Take this advance, I return the
vehicle in two days. - No problem.

505
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,990
My friend,
I am very happy to see you.

506
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:19,210
But how did you come so suddenly?

507
00:43:19,594 --> 00:43:22,074
There are few more days left
for your punishment to get over.

508
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,250
I had to come.

509
00:43:24,546 --> 00:43:25,906
Have you come for Mohini?
- Yes.

510
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,330
Any information about Lotia Pathan?

511
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:31,113
His hideout is in the
slums of Kasara Ghat.

512
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:34,074
But how did you
come to know about it?

513
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,930
One can get the
address of every hooligan...

514
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:37,690
...of Mumbai in
Kafoor smoker's place.

515
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,538
Give anyone of them 10- 15
rupees to smoke drugs over there...

516
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:42,970
...and you will
automatically get the information.

517
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:48,274
But we will have to go there fully
prepared. There may be a brawl.

518
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,442
Just tell me when we have to go.

519
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:52,914
Just now. At this moment.

520
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:58,379
How is your life going on?

521
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,050
"The owner of the chickens,
save your chickens..."

522
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:05,715
"The owner of the chickens,
save your chickens..."

523
00:44:39,122 --> 00:44:40,442
Sir, you and here.

524
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,090
Though you have changed
your path and profession.

525
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:47,003
But I am still walking
on the same path...

526
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:48,746
...and my profession too is the same.

527
00:44:50,467 --> 00:44:52,987
Mahesh, you are under arrest.

528
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:59,499
What is my crime?
- If you are banished my court then...

529
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,970
...surely you must have
committed some crime.

530
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,978
The law might have thought
of keeping you far from...

531
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:07,610
...the society for the
welfare of the society.

532
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:09,722
The same society had
banished Lord Ram too...

533
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,290
...for 14 years for their benefit.
What was his crime, sir?

534
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,610
But you are a
criminal in the eyes of law.

535
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:27,107
Don't you know what
are the consequences...

536
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:28,642
...of showing a knife to a police?

537
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:32,131
I know it, sir. Imprisonment
of 1 or 2 years, what else?

538
00:45:32,781 --> 00:45:37,130
I am ready for it but now it is
important that I should go, sir.

539
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,170
Let's go, Baban.

540
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:45,218
Mahesh! Wait! My duty says
that I should arrest you.

541
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:48,003
And if necessary
then I should shoot you.

542
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,930
Then shoot me.
- No, I am not going to do so.

543
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,330
Because I what to know that
how the one who had taken...

544
00:45:56,394 --> 00:45:59,714
...an oath to die for the country
has become its enemy?

545
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:03,010
I have forgotten my past life.
- You will have to remember it.

546
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:06,707
Because my duty is not only
to stop the criminals but...

547
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,810
...it is to stop the crime also.

548
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,970
And if I come to know
that how a talented youth...

549
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:14,378
...like you become criminals
then it is possible that...

550
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:19,506
...I might stop some youths
from becoming criminals in future.

551
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:21,937
You are talking about
stopping the criminals.

552
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,866
Your police made me a criminal, sir.

553
00:46:25,738 --> 00:46:29,378
How? - I don't have the time
to state it now, sir.

554
00:46:29,643 --> 00:46:31,763
You give me time of only one day.

555
00:46:32,106 --> 00:46:35,146
I will surrender myself
to you within 24 hours.

556
00:46:35,386 --> 00:46:37,466
And then I will tell you everything
that you want to know, sir.

557
00:46:37,811 --> 00:46:40,611
And then you can give me
whatever punishment you want.

558
00:46:41,722 --> 00:46:45,322
Look Mahesh, I cannot give you time.

559
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:48,778
But I can come with you.
- That is okay.

560
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:58,810
Yes Mahesh, tell me
that how you got banished.

561
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:03,522
After coming from Nasik
I joined a college here.

562
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,850
And started working in
Boat club's swimming pool.

563
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:14,450
One day I met a girl there.
Her name was Mohini.

564
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:16,179
Lift up your legs!

565
00:47:17,241 --> 00:47:19,601
Isn't there any
lady teacher to teach?

566
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,435
Why are you trying to
terminate me from my job?

567
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:25,343
If you paddle your legs on the
water, you will learn to swim.

568
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:29,390
I would like to drown
before a man touches me.

569
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:33,575
As you wish, but I don't have
any problem in touching girls.

570
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,030
Come on girls, time is up. Come on.

571
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,360
Look at the attitude of this queen.

572
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,480
I would like to drown
before a man touches me.

573
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:50,184
In the swimming pool of his heart.

574
00:47:51,672 --> 00:47:56,112
Wait fatso, I will show you
in whose swimming pool. Wait.

575
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
Someone help her.

576
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,880
Help...

577
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:07,888
Help...

578
00:48:11,784 --> 00:48:13,624
Help me...

579
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,960
Help...

580
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:43,632
Come... let's see what has happened.

581
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,480
Not the learner but at
least the one who is drowning...

582
00:49:09,552 --> 00:49:12,832
...should not have the
problem that the one who...

583
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,800
...saved her was a man or a woman.

584
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,000
Thank you for getting saved.

585
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,920
- Let's go!

586
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,846
Thank God!

587
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:36,232
Hey brother! How are you.

588
00:49:36,828 --> 00:49:37,588
Hi!

589
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:39,447
You!

590
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:41,144
Hey guy, has the
college not started yet?

591
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,360
There is a lot of time left.

592
00:49:42,432 --> 00:49:44,312
Take us to drink tea.
- Yes, sure.

593
00:49:44,474 --> 00:49:47,000
What happened?
- Someone stole my purse.

594
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:49,086
How will you have a purse?

595
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,720
I had stolen someone's in the morning.
-

596
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:52,816
You found me only?

597
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,362
Look that is Guldasta,
let's praise him...

598
00:49:58,455 --> 00:50:00,135
...we will get
breakfast along with tea.

599
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,400
That is good! Fantastic!

600
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:12,080
"The wind is blowing,
remembering of someone..."

601
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,880
"The wind is blowing..."
- Wow...

602
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:24,359
Great Guldasta!
- Please sit!

603
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:28,750
We want tea today.
- What a nice voice.

604
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,110
What will you have?

605
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,790
My heart is filled with joy!
- Have something.

606
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:38,422
Have something... Tea...
- Tea. - Tea.

607
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,950
What will you eat?
- To eat?

608
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:44,110
No brother, how is it possible?
- Okay!

609
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,494
Guldasta!
- Yes sir!

610
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:48,132
Sometimes it is
difficult for us to decide...

611
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:49,988
...whether your tea is more
sweet or your voice is sweet.

612
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:51,910
How come your tea is so sweet?

613
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:57,093
"You called me and I came
after you with my life in hands..."

614
00:50:57,233 --> 00:51:01,710
I think we will not drink tea from
Guldasta's hands for a long time now.

615
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:03,983
If Laxmikant sees you.
- Not sees but hears...

616
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:08,743
If he hears you then you will
directly go to the HMV studio.

617
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,158
Look, one day we will sit here
at this tea stall...

618
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,430
...and listen to Guldasta's song.

619
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,350
Your friend is a music director,
isn't it? - Who?

620
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,870
I see, that one. - The one who
arranges programme in TV's.

621
00:51:20,942 --> 00:51:23,542
The same one who give
chance to new comers. - Yes!

622
00:51:23,606 --> 00:51:26,446
Introduce him with him.
- Yes.

623
00:51:27,445 --> 00:51:30,645
How much should I pay?
- Don't make me feel embarrassed.

624
00:51:30,693 --> 00:51:32,373
How can I take money from you?
- What else will you take?

625
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,100
No! At least once introduce me to
that music director, please!

626
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,830
Hey Guldasta!
- Problem is created.

627
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,030
Yes, sir. - Keep this sugar
and tea powder inside.

628
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,750
And listen! Keep in mind
to take money from them.

629
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,070
You always forget to
take money from them.

630
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,910
Actually sir, they are
the real appreciators.

631
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,190
And there are very few
in this world who...

632
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:50,325
...appreciates the real art.

633
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,134
Keep quiet!
Go and take money from them.

634
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,710
Sir, deduct money from my salary.

635
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:59,670
What did you say?

636
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,190
Hey, my band of boys.

637
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,710
Hi!

638
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,134
So boys, what is going on?

639
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,990
We are trying to impress the girls.
-

640
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:21,054
What will you impress girls?
You are just fooling around.

641
00:52:21,142 --> 00:52:22,702
Just saying that red one is
mine and yellow one is mine.

642
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:24,910
If you have the guts
then go and talk to her.

643
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:27,622
Hey Munna master,
you go and propose a girl.

644
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,950
The Mumbai girls are very strict.

645
00:52:29,998 --> 00:52:33,318
Girls are girls whether it
is Nasik or it is Mumbai.

646
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:35,181
One doesn't need a license
of the city to impress girls...

647
00:52:35,246 --> 00:52:37,006
...he should have brains.

648
00:52:37,078 --> 00:52:39,198
You are wrong at that point,
brother Munna.

649
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:42,894
One needs a heart to
love not the brains.

650
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:44,358
Do you remember Anand Bakshi's song?

651
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:50,910
"Love is not done! - It happens!"
"You cannot give your heart..."

652
00:52:50,974 --> 00:53:00,574
"What is a heart,
take away my life..."

653
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,030
"Enough..."
- Enough. -

654
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:06,214
You all watch so many films
then too you don't understand.

655
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,110
The way situations
are created in films...

656
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:10,967
...to make one laugh or cry...

657
00:53:11,046 --> 00:53:13,886
...the same way we can make one
to love us in life.

658
00:53:14,045 --> 00:53:17,925
Oh! You mean, we can
make someone love us...

659
00:53:17,996 --> 00:53:19,236
...by doing a drama.

660
00:53:19,548 --> 00:53:23,988
No doubt of it. - Hey brother,
this is neither Nasik nor a drama.

661
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:27,045
You will have to get beaten up
with sandals.

662
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,680
No master, decision
cannot be made this way.

663
00:53:30,736 --> 00:53:32,896
Show us the way to
use your psychology...

664
00:53:32,952 --> 00:53:35,192
...then only we will know about it.

665
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:37,225
Not free of cost, if you
are ready to bet then talk.

666
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,577
Yes...
- Bet!

667
00:53:38,642 --> 00:53:40,642
How much?
- Hundred rupees. - Hundred rupees.

668
00:53:40,745 --> 00:53:42,705
Hey Baban, he is betting with me.

669
00:53:42,777 --> 00:53:44,697
Yes, done.
- Done.

670
00:53:46,586 --> 00:53:47,746
Do you know what she started
saying?

671
00:53:47,928 --> 00:53:48,768
She started saying that wait...

672
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,065
Hi girls.
- ...I am Mrs. Singh. Hi.

673
00:53:51,137 --> 00:53:53,937
What is the name of
the girl who was the...

674
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:55,866
...college queen last year?
- Nikita.

675
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:58,474
Yes, Nikita...
In which class does she study?

676
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,890
In my class.
- And in which class do you study?

677
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:03,595
In Nikita's class.
-

678
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,120
I mean I study
in your sister Jyoti's class.

679
00:54:07,568 --> 00:54:09,728
It means that I will
have to talk to Jyoti.

680
00:54:09,903 --> 00:54:12,303
You do one thing,
if you find Jyoti then...

681
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,215
...ask her to meet me in
canteen during lunch time.

682
00:54:14,279 --> 00:54:15,879
I have an urgent work her, okay.
- Okay.

683
00:54:15,944 --> 00:54:17,304
Bye.
- Bye.

684
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,000
I will go now.

685
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:25,744
Why have you come so late brother?

686
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,903
You wanted some money,
didn't you? Keep this!

687
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:30,742
Money! When did I ask for money?

688
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,560
You had not asked.
- Hi. - Hi.

689
00:54:34,118 --> 00:54:36,558
Then you might have told
me about going for a movie.

690
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,520
Come we will go!

691
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,400
Why are you
buttering me so much today?

692
00:54:40,551 --> 00:54:41,991
What is the matter?

693
00:54:42,087 --> 00:54:45,607
Actually Jyoti, the one...
that girl in your class...

694
00:54:45,776 --> 00:54:48,576
...who has blue eyes,
the one with brown hair.

695
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,080
The same one who was
the queen last year.

696
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,440
Nikita.
- Yes...

697
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,424
Introduce me to her, please.

698
00:54:55,512 --> 00:55:00,552
Ouch! I am asking.
I will introduce you to Nikita.

699
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,040
But you too will have
to do one thing for me.

700
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,976
What are you saying?
Who else will come to help...

701
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:08,072
...except brother to sister
and sister to brother. Tell me.

702
00:55:08,424 --> 00:55:10,944
She is my friend Mohini,
she has some work with you.

703
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:12,390
Tell him.

704
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,280
Speak up.

705
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,640
I wanted your notes
of psychology and...

706
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,080
...if you teach it yourself then...

707
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,000
Actually there is no
problem in teaching.

708
00:55:30,158 --> 00:55:31,878
But the problem is of time.

709
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,680
He is going on doing the drama.

710
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,040
He is acting too smart.

711
00:55:35,174 --> 00:55:37,574
There she is. Nikita!

712
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,240
Hi.
- Hi!

713
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,080
Hi!

714
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:46,017
Hello... Hi!

715
00:55:49,129 --> 00:55:50,649
What she is looking!

716
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,520
I am sorry, I am really sorry.

717
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:59,049
There is no need for sorry,
I really enjoyed it.

718
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,120
Did you get hurt somewhere?
- No.

719
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,158
Will you please sit there?
- What?

720
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:10,035
There.

721
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,335
Sit...
- Thank you.

722
00:56:14,415 --> 00:56:15,935
Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

723
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,960
Nikita, he is my brother Mahesh.

724
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,600
Hello, I am Nikita Sharma.
- I am Mahesh Deshmukh.

725
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,880
You are the one who passed
with first class in psychology.

726
00:56:26,928 --> 00:56:29,688
Yes. - I was thinking that
if you teach it to me then...

727
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:30,769
Why not?

728
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,288
You've made my life.

729
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,920
I didn't understand.

730
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,440
Actually Nikita, I am very much
interested in teaching psychology.

731
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:45,015
And if I get a student like you then...
Did you understand it?

732
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,880
But do you have so much time for me?

733
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:54,057
Time, we don't have time
but we have to find time.

734
00:56:54,151 --> 00:56:56,671
Thank you... thank you very much.

735
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,640
Why don't we start
from today onwards?

736
00:56:58,774 --> 00:57:02,480
Far from this crowd,
somewhere in isolation.

737
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,125
The place where
there would be no one...

738
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:06,831
...except me, you and psychology.

739
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,480
Let's go to such place.
- You are gone Mohini.

740
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,160
Now go to Badri Nath
and worship god.

741
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:16,696
Let's go.
- Yes.

742
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,960
Your book.

743
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,160
Brother, what about us?
- Try to understand.

744
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,079
Bye.
- He has gone. Let's go.

745
00:57:41,656 --> 00:57:43,616
It seems that she is
waiting for Munna.

746
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:45,662
It looks like they have made
plans to go out somewhere.

747
00:57:45,767 --> 00:57:47,127
I will teach her a lesson now.

748
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:09,794
Nikita.
- Hi.

749
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:11,257
Shall we go?
- Yes.

750
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:15,305
The tyre of your car is punctured.

751
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:20,241
Oh God! What will happen now?

752
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:21,696
What is the problem in it Nikita?

753
00:58:21,768 --> 00:58:24,488
We have this Indian
Impala, we will go in it. Sit.

754
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,351
Should I sit?
- Yes, sit.

755
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,200
Shall we go?
- Yes.

756
00:58:57,944 --> 00:59:04,784
He doesn't look over me.
I think he must about Nikita.

757
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,880
What are you thinking Mohini?
Just jump.

758
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:12,463
What if he doesn't come?

759
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,600
So what! The one to give up
their life for love create history.

760
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,880
Jump Mohini, jump...

761
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:36,168
Help me, help me...

762
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,840
You come here to
practice swimming or...

763
00:59:38,936 --> 00:59:40,456
...to practice how to drown.

764
00:59:41,216 --> 00:59:42,656
If you drown a few more times then...

765
00:59:42,736 --> 00:59:44,456
...you will get the
practice to drown.

766
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:45,807
Munna!

767
00:59:50,016 --> 00:59:52,416
Hi!
- Hi! -

768
00:59:52,577 --> 00:59:57,577
Help me. Help me.
-

769
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,064
Stand straight!
You just stand straight!

770
01:00:03,272 --> 01:00:05,952
You are in just two foot
of water, only two foot.

771
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,736
When did you come?
- Just now.

772
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,312
I teach swimming over here.

773
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Is that so? How many of
them have you drowned?

774
01:00:16,465 --> 01:00:19,425
Just 30 to 40 of them.
-

775
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,840
How come you are here?
- I didn't swim for long time.

776
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,320
But when I found out that
you teach swimming here...

777
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,560
...I decided to start again.

778
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,761
Why not? Why not?
- Can you teach me, diving?

779
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:30,816
Diving! I got 30-40 medals in diving.
Come on.

780
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,360
Come on.
- Ok. Let's go.

781
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:38,641
First raise your hand and then...

782
01:01:10,296 --> 01:01:12,456
Hi, Jyoti. - Hi.
- Hi, Mohini.

783
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,040
'Here comes the spoilsport.'
Hi, Nikita. - Hi.

784
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,160
Have you finished your lunch?

785
01:01:17,224 --> 01:01:19,024
Yes! We are just
waiting for my brother.

786
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,360
Shall I join you?
- Why not? Sit.

787
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:23,953
We will not be able to digest
our food if you don't sit here?

788
01:01:24,064 --> 01:01:26,064
Yes, it is my affect.

789
01:01:26,136 --> 01:01:29,096
Hey you,
Did you find this table only in...

790
01:01:29,176 --> 01:01:30,536
...this canteen to show your affect?

791
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:32,121
If you want to show
your affect then...

792
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:33,401
...give everyone a bit of
opportunity to show the affect.

793
01:01:33,513 --> 01:01:36,633
If you have any problem then...
I thought that Munna was here...

794
01:01:36,713 --> 01:01:40,153
Munna, look how much
pain she has for him.

795
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,240
When that poor
hungry Munna comes here...

796
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,240
...then make him sit in
front of you and feed him.

797
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,640
Both of you will be satisfied.

798
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:47,048
You are crossing
your limits, Mohini.

799
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:49,473
You are talking about limits.

800
01:01:49,577 --> 01:01:51,817
Even a witch leaves nine
houses before she attacks.

801
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:56,192
And you act as my friend,
talk very sweetly with us.

802
01:01:56,256 --> 01:01:58,296
Hi Jyoti! Hi Mohini!

803
01:01:58,368 --> 01:02:01,368
And on the other hand you
stick like a fly to jaggery.

804
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:04,672
In my culture, I don't give
answer to such cheap questions.

805
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,520
Who is asking for the answer?

806
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:09,592
I didn't swim for many days so
I thought of starting it again.

807
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,160
I do not know psychology,
teach it to me. -

808
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:15,568
Learn as much
psychology as you want.

809
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:17,424
If possible then learn psychology...

810
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:19,121
...for your next seven births,
so that you are fully satisfied.

811
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,113
If I would have known that
there are ill mannered...

812
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,410
...stupid and crazy girls like
you in this college then...

813
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:25,296
...I would have never
come here to study.

814
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:35,714
Munna, I am going.
- You are leaving the college.

815
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:40,208
No! I am leaving this city.
- Leaving this city.

816
01:02:40,767 --> 01:02:42,207
You are leaving this
city just because...

817
01:02:42,264 --> 01:02:43,664
...of some crazy girls foolish words.

818
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:45,808
Munna, after being
humiliated so much...

819
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,080
...I am not in a position
to show my face to anyone.

820
01:02:49,168 --> 01:02:51,448
Nikita, how should I explain to you.

821
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,560
There is no need to
take it so seriously.

822
01:02:54,769 --> 01:02:57,969
This is far more
serious than you think.

823
01:02:58,617 --> 01:02:59,817
I am going.

824
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,720
Nikita, when will you meet me again?

825
01:03:05,872 --> 01:03:08,592
Never.
- Not even by coincidence?

826
01:03:08,728 --> 01:03:11,008
No, not even by coincidence.

827
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:15,927
I have stopped the love this
time which Mohini has awakened...

828
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,720
...in my heart for you. But I won't be
able to stop it the next time.

829
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:29,414
What? Nikita went away.

830
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,080
I wanted to ask for forgiveness.

831
01:03:34,392 --> 01:03:36,432
I said a lot of
rubbish to her yesterday.

832
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,440
Munna, What is this that I have done?

833
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,120
I myself didn't know
what I was saying.

834
01:03:43,632 --> 01:03:48,752
I only knew so much that I
started loving you. - With me.

835
01:03:50,144 --> 01:03:54,224
Yes Munna, I love you.

836
01:03:55,175 --> 01:03:57,655
And I can do anything to get you.

837
01:03:57,727 --> 01:04:03,127
Mohini, I cannot believe that
a girl could love me so much.

838
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,424
And that too a girl like you
for whom...

839
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:08,752
...any boy from the college would
be ready to commit a murder too.

840
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:11,703
You just smile,
that is enough for me.

841
01:04:13,911 --> 01:04:18,591
Mohini, I cannot believe
that the love for which...

842
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,960
...I was wandering around so
much would be so close to me.

843
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:27,952
That means... Munna, you
will accept me, won't you?

844
01:04:28,184 --> 01:04:29,384
Yes, Mohini.

845
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,400
Look there.

846
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:46,999
"Heer got crazy calling Ranjha..."

847
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:49,263
"She got involved in
love in such a way that..."

848
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:51,440
"...she was neither able
to sleep or remain awake."

849
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:55,256
"She does not remember
anything except name..."

850
01:04:55,313 --> 01:05:00,233
So Baban, saw how I enticed her?
- How you did it?

851
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:02,968
Not this way, first catch your ears.

852
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:04,223
We caught our ears.

853
01:05:04,344 --> 01:05:06,704
And repeat along with me.
- What?

854
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,960
Whether it is Nasik or Mumbai.

855
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:10,550
Whether it is Nasik or Mumbai.

856
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,560
The girls are girls, one
should know how to impress them.

857
01:05:13,616 --> 01:05:16,776
The girls are girls, one
should know how to impress them.

858
01:05:17,031 --> 01:05:19,351
Love doesn't happen,
it is made to happen.

859
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,655
Love doesn't happen,
it is made to happen.

860
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,320
Hail to psychology!

861
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:28,896
Hey Kaichi, where are you going?

862
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,600
Give me the money of betting.

863
01:05:30,673 --> 01:05:32,713
Take it.
- Give it.

864
01:05:32,816 --> 01:05:34,336
I am not running.

865
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:36,008
Now tell us the formula.

866
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:37,575
Will you give me a
party at Golden gate?

867
01:05:37,623 --> 01:05:39,223
He is a greedy man.
- Do you agree?

868
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,240
Agreed.

869
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,960
Hello. - Mohini, I wanted to
tell you that Munna is fooling you.

870
01:05:48,439 --> 01:05:50,199
What Munna?

871
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,200
He is using you just to...

872
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,120
He is playing with your feelings.

873
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:56,168
What is this fun going on?

874
01:05:56,241 --> 01:05:58,361
If you don't believe
your well wishers...

875
01:05:58,513 --> 01:06:00,673
...then go the
Golden gate hotel and...

876
01:06:00,784 --> 01:06:03,344
...see it with your own eyes.
- But you...

877
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,760
So this is formula no. 46.
And its name is...

878
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,720
"See somewhere
and hit somewhere..."

879
01:06:17,784 --> 01:06:21,464
"See somewhere
and hit somewhere..."

880
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,240
If you want to impress a
girl by this formula then...

881
01:06:25,303 --> 01:06:30,183
...give importance to
her friend so much that...

882
01:06:30,248 --> 01:06:31,648
...she gets jealous.

883
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,880
And after that, when the
iron is really very hot...

884
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:38,391
...at that time...
- Strike the hammer!

885
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,520
Munna, leave this
thing and tell me...

886
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,320
...what had happened in
swimming pool? - Yes.

887
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:49,512
At the swimming pool,
she told me very openly.

888
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,560
What did she say?
- Munna, I really love you very much.

889
01:06:54,624 --> 01:06:56,144
She said that?

890
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,840
Master, I too placed a
dialogue at that time.

891
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,600
What?
- Tell Munna...

892
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,600
Mohini, I don't believe it.

893
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,120
This is as if you got to eat
sweets by acting as a fool.

894
01:07:12,176 --> 01:07:15,536
You spoke a bit more.
- Then?

895
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,240
And then I praised her a lot.

896
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:23,680
Praised her? - I told her that
I had never dreamt that...

897
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:26,289
...any girl would love me so much.

898
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:29,783
And that too a girl like you
for whom any boy...

899
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,240
...in college would commit a murder.

900
01:07:31,304 --> 01:07:33,944
You have really
praised that female so much.

901
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:38,513
Then she said that Munna,
you just smile...

902
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:39,920
...once for me, that's
is enough for me. - Up!

903
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:43,607
Then I thought that I should do
full and final of that girl. - Yes!

904
01:07:43,657 --> 01:07:48,159
You are great enticer.
- I caught her and said...

905
01:07:48,392 --> 01:07:52,792
Mohini, I was blind till now,
I did not know that the love for which...

906
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:58,000
...I was wandering
around is so close to me.

907
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,720
Hey Munna, I am not Mohini I am Baban...
- She was so close to me...

908
01:08:02,215 --> 01:08:04,175
Not in search of love, Munna.

909
01:08:07,527 --> 01:08:10,207
And this girl who is standing in
front of you, Mahesh Deshmukh.

910
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:13,089
The girl who loves you.

911
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:16,288
You used her like an animal?

912
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,200
Just to win a
hundred rupees bet you...

913
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,880
...slashed her feelings
just to prove your formula.

914
01:08:27,664 --> 01:08:30,224
You have no value for my love.

915
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,000
You too are one of them whom I hate.

916
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:44,804
But... but the day you understand the...

917
01:08:44,863 --> 01:08:47,063
...difference between an animal
and a human being...

918
01:08:48,097 --> 01:08:51,457
...that day you will
hate yourself the most.

919
01:09:41,038 --> 01:09:45,838
Mohini... just listen to me.

920
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,960
I was craving from a long
time to meet you to talk to you.

921
01:09:50,192 --> 01:09:53,432
Since the incident at the Golden Gate,
I have been waiting for you...

922
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,920
...outside the college everyday for you.

923
01:09:56,009 --> 01:09:57,649
And then in the evening...

924
01:09:57,777 --> 01:09:59,537
...the whole night I was waiting in
front of your house.

925
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,992
But you must have not
come out of your room.

926
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:03,984
Don't talk to me.
- Why should I not talk to you?

927
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:05,423
There my sister Jyoti
too is not talking to me.

928
01:10:05,504 --> 01:10:09,104
And my friends... they too have
vanished without telling me.

929
01:10:09,176 --> 01:10:12,696
Mohini... how should I tell you that...

930
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,240
...what I am going
through after that day.

931
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,400
Get side.

932
01:10:15,456 --> 01:10:17,736
Mohini, I have
started hating myself but...

933
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:20,832
...I have really started loving you, Mohini!
- Shut up!

934
01:10:20,897 --> 01:10:22,017
Mohini!
- All are watching!

935
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:24,481
Mohini, I know that after that day
you must have felt bad, very bad.

936
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,790
Please forgive me, Mohini...

937
01:10:27,553 --> 01:10:29,353
Leave me! Let me go.

938
01:10:29,409 --> 01:10:31,569
Mohini, how should I
make you understand that...

939
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:33,113
...how much I love you.

940
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:36,528
Should I kill myself?

941
01:10:36,624 --> 01:10:39,144
I swear, I can kill myself
by jumping from this building.

942
01:10:39,304 --> 01:10:41,344
Just say and see,
if you don't say then too...

943
01:10:41,432 --> 01:10:43,192
...I will jump and kill myself.

944
01:10:43,465 --> 01:10:47,985
Look, how dangerous it is.
If I die then there will be a problem.

945
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:49,257
You won't get the
chance to say sorry.

946
01:10:49,305 --> 01:10:50,625
You will not be able
to forgive yourself.

947
01:10:50,744 --> 01:10:52,224
If you are so much
interested in committing suicide...

948
01:10:52,343 --> 01:10:53,783
...then jump from anywhere,
either from a six storied building...

949
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:55,112
...or from the Qutub Minar.

950
01:10:55,344 --> 01:10:57,144
I have nothing to do
with your feelings.

951
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:01,289
Mohini, this is not
a hobby, it is love.

952
01:11:01,936 --> 01:11:04,496
Look at me, this is not a joke.

953
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,600
How should make you understand?

954
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,800
You don't have to
make me understand.

955
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,480
There is no need to
explain anything to me.

956
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:12,108
Okay.

957
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:19,128
Get back! Munna.

958
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,960
Now tell me that you love
me as you loved me before!

959
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,880
Munna, come down.

960
01:11:25,936 --> 01:11:27,976
Or else I will jump from here.

961
01:11:28,103 --> 01:11:30,223
Munna, you are simply
wasting yours and my time.

962
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,440
Mohini! I will count till three
and if you still don't agree...

963
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,000
...then I will kill
myself by jumping from here.

964
01:11:39,273 --> 01:11:43,473
You can count up to hundred,
I don't have anything to do with it.

965
01:11:43,695 --> 01:11:46,295
One... Two,...

966
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,990
Go back! Come down!

967
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,200
Three...

968
01:13:00,632 --> 01:13:07,152
"Tell me that you
are mine or else..."

969
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:14,280
"I don't want to live,
I want to die..."

970
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:19,920
"Tell me that you
are mine or else..."

971
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:24,344
"I don't want to live,
I want to die..."

972
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:28,881
"Look, don't ever
say such things..."

973
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:33,280
"Look, don't ever
do such things..."

974
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,160
"Your these
qualities are a torment..."

975
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,520
"Listen, you have my oath..."

976
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,840
"Tell me that you
are mine or else..."

977
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,040
"I don't want to live,
I want to die..."

978
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:41,584
"I had hurt your
feelings the other day..."

979
01:14:41,656 --> 01:14:47,216
"I am still sad because of it..."

980
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:57,921
"Forgive me thinking that
this is my first love, dear..."

981
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:00,800
"It is my love, dear..."

982
01:15:00,879 --> 01:15:05,279
"These qualities of
yours is a torment..."

983
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,680
"Listen, you have my oath."

984
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,040
"Tell me that you
are mine or else..."

985
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,000
"I don't want to live,
I want to die..."

986
01:15:51,288 --> 01:15:56,088
"Promise me one thing today..."

987
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:01,400
"You won't make
mischief in future..."

988
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:12,600
" As much as I love you,
you too will love me that much..."

989
01:16:12,664 --> 01:16:15,304
"You will love me..."

990
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:19,992
"These qualities of
yours is a torment..."

991
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:24,391
"Listen, you have my oath..."

992
01:16:24,545 --> 01:16:28,985
"Tell me that you
are mine or else..."

993
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,080
"I don't want to live,
I want to die..."

994
01:17:12,992 --> 01:17:17,592
"Complaint and Criticism...
Complaint and Criticism..."

995
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,080
"Complaint and
Criticism are story of past..."

996
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:26,600
"Now I will never
be angry with you..."

997
01:17:26,656 --> 01:17:30,936
"Now I am yours, just yours..."

998
01:17:31,008 --> 01:17:35,328
"I will die but won't
separate from you..."

999
01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:39,344
"Now I will never
be angry with you."

1000
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,360
"Now I will not be a betrayer..."

1001
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:47,840
"These qualities of
yours is a torment..."

1002
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,920
"Listen, you have my oath..."

1003
01:17:52,343 --> 01:17:56,663
"Tell me that you
are mine or else..."

1004
01:17:56,736 --> 01:18:01,136
"I don't want to live,
I want to die..."

1005
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:05,560
"Look, don't ever
do such things..."

1006
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,920
"Look, don't ever
say such things..."

1007
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:14,504
"These qualities of
yours is a torment..."

1008
01:18:14,584 --> 01:18:18,944
"Listen, you have my oath..."

1009
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,360
"These qualities of
yours is a torment..."

1010
01:18:23,433 --> 01:18:27,713
"Listen, you have my oath..."

1011
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,960
Mohini!
- Yes!

1012
01:18:42,001 --> 01:18:45,641
We should stop these daily meetings.

1013
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,240
Why? I have heard
that the wife looks...

1014
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,160
...boring after seven
years of marriage.

1015
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,080
And you have got bored now itself?
- Exams are nearing.

1016
01:18:54,504 --> 01:18:56,864
And if I get a first
class this time then...

1017
01:18:56,952 --> 01:18:59,352
...I will easily get a
job in the Navy this time.

1018
01:18:59,888 --> 01:19:01,528
You want to become a Navy officer.

1019
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,640
Yes, it was my father's dream.

1020
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,960
Mohini, this job is not
just a basic need but...

1021
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,640
...a reason to attach
and serve my country.

1022
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:16,384
And what if you become
a Traffic constable?

1023
01:19:16,488 --> 01:19:18,688
Then I will stop the
traffic and say that...

1024
01:19:18,775 --> 01:19:22,295
...wait, madam Mohini
is passing this way.

1025
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:24,648
Shall we move?
- Yes.

1026
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,360
Don't you feel ashamed to
wander about with scoundrels?

1027
01:19:40,432 --> 01:19:43,392
Father, you can abuse
me in any way you want.

1028
01:19:43,944 --> 01:19:46,144
This is not a mark of decency to...

1029
01:19:46,231 --> 01:19:47,431
...talk such rubbish
about unknown people.

1030
01:19:47,504 --> 01:19:49,104
Then is it a mark of decency to...

1031
01:19:49,176 --> 01:19:50,381
...fool around with
girls from good families?

1032
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:53,190
You should be ashamed
to talk such things...

1033
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:55,039
...with your daughter.
- Just keep quiet!

1034
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:57,981
I used to feel like an orphan
even though my father being alive.

1035
01:19:59,744 --> 01:20:02,304
But I got peace
when Munna touched me.

1036
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,680
I feel safe under his shelter.

1037
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,520
Do you know the
status of the one with...

1038
01:20:09,183 --> 01:20:11,263
...whom you are in love with?
-

1039
01:20:11,552 --> 01:20:14,952
His father was a simple clerk.

1040
01:20:15,992 --> 01:20:18,752
He has a broken house to live.

1041
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,960
To look after the expense
he works in swimming pool...

1042
01:20:22,024 --> 01:20:24,544
...for 500 rupees, just 500 rupees.

1043
01:20:25,384 --> 01:20:29,944
And his friends, all of them
are unemployed and loafer. Shame!

1044
01:20:31,177 --> 01:20:33,657
His father was a
clerk but he used to...

1045
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,752
...feed his wife and
children with his own earnings.

1046
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,510
He did not survive on
his children's earnings.

1047
01:20:39,697 --> 01:20:43,337
He has a broken rented house,
but it is better than...

1048
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:45,656
...this bungalow which is mortgaged.

1049
01:20:46,192 --> 01:20:48,672
He works for just
rupees five hundred.

1050
01:20:48,737 --> 01:20:52,057
But it is better than the
one who is drowned in debts.

1051
01:20:53,264 --> 01:20:55,744
His friends are
unemployed and loafers but...

1052
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:57,750
...they are not gamblers.

1053
01:21:00,161 --> 01:21:04,681
You taunt me.
How does it concern your father...

1054
01:21:04,769 --> 01:21:06,649
...if I gamble or drink liquor.

1055
01:21:06,712 --> 01:21:09,592
Yes, it does not concern my father...

1056
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:10,856
...but it concerns my mother.

1057
01:21:11,007 --> 01:21:13,567
Shut up, first tell me that...

1058
01:21:13,647 --> 01:21:15,087
...why didn't you go
to your dance classes?

1059
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:16,631
I won't go?
- Why will you not go?

1060
01:21:16,815 --> 01:21:18,895
I don't like these things.
I want to study.

1061
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:20,999
Let your studies be aside,
you have to get ready for...

1062
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:22,750
...the stage show within
six months, understood.

1063
01:21:23,976 --> 01:21:25,456
I do not want to do the stage show.

1064
01:21:26,872 --> 01:21:28,632
It seems that you won't
understand in this manner.

1065
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:45,208
Keep in mind that if you
meet that guy again then...

1066
01:21:45,366 --> 01:21:47,766
...I will do the same thing that
I did to your mother. Understood!

1067
01:21:59,758 --> 01:22:01,758
You all go to the
office and sit, I am coming.

1068
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:07,271
Lotia, I don't understand one thing.

1069
01:22:08,192 --> 01:22:10,632
You do not drink,
you do not smoke and...

1070
01:22:10,878 --> 01:22:12,118
...neither you go to the dance bar.

1071
01:22:12,167 --> 01:22:14,047
You do not have a bungalow,
you do not have cars and...

1072
01:22:14,104 --> 01:22:15,824
...neither you have
any luxurious items.

1073
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,040
You have so much money that
it seems as it is pouring.

1074
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,960
Why do you need so much money?

1075
01:22:20,678 --> 01:22:24,518
Money is not my need,
it is my weapon, Shyamlal.

1076
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:25,869
Tell me, what you want?

1077
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:27,957
My bottle is empty,
I need some money.

1078
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:30,580
You have not paid the earlier debt.

1079
01:22:30,636 --> 01:22:31,836
Lotia, I will pay everything to you.

1080
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:35,260
Just as soon as my daughter
Mohini starts dancing on stage.

1081
01:22:35,363 --> 01:22:38,163
I will pay all your debts,
believe me.

1082
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:42,620
Lotia never depends on the
promise of his debtors, Shyamlal.

1083
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:45,380
When Lotia gives,
he doesn't make any favours.

1084
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,660
And when he takes he
doesn't spare anyone.

1085
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:49,939
From when is your daughter
going to start her stage shows?

1086
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:52,291
Lotia, if it had been in
my hands then I would...

1087
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:54,380
...have made her dance now itself.

1088
01:22:54,429 --> 01:22:57,709
But what can I do? From the day
that guy is behind my daughter...

1089
01:22:57,796 --> 01:22:58,996
...her behaviour has
completely changed.

1090
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:00,860
I don't want to fall in any trouble.

1091
01:23:00,954 --> 01:23:03,674
I want to live happily with
on my daughter's earnings.

1092
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:04,740
So what is wrong in it?

1093
01:23:04,804 --> 01:23:07,444
You tell me, what is my mistake if
I got a daughter instead of a son?

1094
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,140
You are absolutely right, Shyamlal.

1095
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,300
Go and take money from inside, go.

1096
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:12,940
Chhote Khan!

1097
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,100
Chhote, give him
twenty thousand rupees.

1098
01:23:17,519 --> 01:23:19,260
Write it in his account.

1099
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,420
Who is this sir?
I had never seen him before.

1100
01:23:22,554 --> 01:23:24,674
He is my brother, Chhote Khan.

1101
01:23:24,715 --> 01:23:26,555
I see... I am happy to meet you.

1102
01:23:26,588 --> 01:23:28,188
He just got released from jail.

1103
01:23:28,268 --> 01:23:29,748
He was caught in a bank
robbery case at Nasik.

1104
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:30,877
He was caught? Oh my God!

1105
01:23:30,934 --> 01:23:33,454
There is no law left
in the country nowadays.

1106
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:36,212
The visits to the jail and
out keep happening, Shyamlal

1107
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,172
I am not worried about it.

1108
01:23:38,748 --> 01:23:41,468
I am worried that Chhote Khan
is the first Pathan...

1109
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:44,597
... in our family to
become a drug addict.

1110
01:23:44,997 --> 01:23:46,957
He cultivated this bad habit in jail.

1111
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:51,740
I will surely take revenge
from the one who sent him to jail.

1112
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:54,501
Who is that unlucky person?
- His name is Munna.

1113
01:23:55,389 --> 01:23:58,949
Munna! Mahesh Kumar
alias Munna, the one...

1114
01:23:58,989 --> 01:24:02,309
...whose parents were killed
in Nasik bank robbery. - Yes!

1115
01:24:02,892 --> 01:24:04,892
Lotia, it means that our
enemy is one and the same.

1116
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:07,260
He is that same Munna
who is after my daughter.

1117
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:08,349
And he has made my life miserable.

1118
01:24:08,469 --> 01:24:09,549
Do you know his address?

1119
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:10,869
Yes, I know it, I will just show you.

1120
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,780
Come, you have done a
great favour on me by coming.

1121
01:24:38,021 --> 01:24:40,021
I was waiting you
from last three days.

1122
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:41,580
I never waited like this
for anyone till today.

1123
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:44,253
But like a crazy person
I used to stand here for 4 hours.

1124
01:24:44,483 --> 01:24:46,083
You should have at least called up...

1125
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,540
...or should have informed Jyoti.

1126
01:24:50,275 --> 01:24:53,035
Munna, this is our last meeting.

1127
01:24:53,884 --> 01:24:55,084
I will not be able to
meet you after today.

1128
01:24:55,133 --> 01:24:57,653
What? What did you say?

1129
01:24:57,732 --> 01:25:00,332
I can't marry you, so
I have decided that...

1130
01:25:00,436 --> 01:25:03,116
Decision! This is the
decision of both our lives...

1131
01:25:03,173 --> 01:25:04,613
...then how did you decide it alone?

1132
01:25:04,677 --> 01:25:07,117
Don't forget that this is the
decision of my life too...

1133
01:25:07,445 --> 01:25:09,325
...and I have the right take it.

1134
01:25:10,468 --> 01:25:12,908
What do you think of yourself?
You have made a joke of it?

1135
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:16,236
I will slap you in such a way that
you will come back to your senses.

1136
01:25:17,141 --> 01:25:19,981
Munna, there is no use of
these things now. I am going.

1137
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,555
I will slash you into pieces and...

1138
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:24,490
...I will slash myself too into pieces.

1139
01:25:24,547 --> 01:25:25,907
What do you think I am?

1140
01:25:26,076 --> 01:25:28,836
You will go away from my life
and I will just keep watching.

1141
01:25:29,274 --> 01:25:31,645
You rich girl,
if I can die for you then...

1142
01:25:31,764 --> 01:25:33,244
...I can even kill you too.

1143
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:36,837
But I won't allow you to
go away from me at any cost.

1144
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:11,693
I wanted to see this
side of your nature too.

1145
01:26:15,932 --> 01:26:20,012
I wanted to see whether the fear
I have of separating from you...

1146
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,100
...do you too have the same?

1147
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:27,188
I wanted to see whether you
are equally craving for me...

1148
01:26:27,684 --> 01:26:29,524
...as I am for you.

1149
01:26:29,588 --> 01:26:33,868
I wanted to see
whether you have got bored...

1150
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,460
...of our daily meetings.

1151
01:26:53,412 --> 01:26:56,532
What happened?
- Nothing.

1152
01:27:12,676 --> 01:27:15,996
Who beat you, Mohini? Who?

1153
01:27:17,028 --> 01:27:20,228
Father.
He punished me for meeting you.

1154
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,500
So I was testing you, Munna.

1155
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:27,230
I have left everything
and come to you, Munna.

1156
01:27:29,797 --> 01:27:32,957
That hell which I
thought was my house.

1157
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,060
Everything,
which I considered as mine.

1158
01:27:36,108 --> 01:27:37,948
I have left
everything and come to you.

1159
01:27:38,029 --> 01:27:40,549
I don't have anything
except these clothes.

1160
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:44,389
I can't give you a
luxurious life but...

1161
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:47,741
...I earn so much that we
can live our livelihood.

1162
01:27:49,372 --> 01:27:53,532
And if we can live our livelihood
then our life too would run.

1163
01:27:58,516 --> 01:28:00,116
Mohini, you have
taken such a big step...

1164
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:01,651
...surely there might
be something important.

1165
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:06,053
Does your father want
you to marry someone else?

1166
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,915
What will he get me married?

1167
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:12,468
He will never allow me to get married.
- Why?

1168
01:28:13,628 --> 01:28:15,468
He wants to make me a singer.

1169
01:28:16,116 --> 01:28:17,636
He wants to live
happily with my income...

1170
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,900
...by making me dance on stage.

1171
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:21,980
He did the same
thing with my mother too.

1172
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:23,772
She used to sing and dance on stage.

1173
01:28:23,828 --> 01:28:25,148
And father used to play the drums.

1174
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:27,100
They fell in love
and then got married.

1175
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:30,188
After marriage he
never played the drums.

1176
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,820
He left the habit of
playing the drums but...

1177
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:33,549
...he got into the habit
of drinking and gambling.

1178
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,308
Whatever mother used
to earn by dancing...

1179
01:28:35,365 --> 01:28:37,365
...he used to spend it on
drinking and gambling.

1180
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,460
Whenever mother used to
fight with father because of it...

1181
01:28:39,556 --> 01:28:41,796
...he used to shut her
mouth by slapping her.

1182
01:28:42,213 --> 01:28:46,133
She used to live with the claps on
the stage and the slaps at home.

1183
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,540
One day God knows how she
suddenly got the strength...

1184
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,116
...to leave the house.

1185
01:28:50,196 --> 01:28:52,756
I am going, I will not
stay even for a second here.

1186
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:55,100
Go, go away, the devils
in human disguise are...

1187
01:28:55,165 --> 01:28:57,685
...waiting outside
for a woman like you...

1188
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,750
...who is alone and helpless. Go.

1189
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:02,508
There are only devils present
in the world created my men whether...

1190
01:29:02,565 --> 01:29:03,725
...it is inside the
house or outside the house.

1191
01:29:03,789 --> 01:29:06,349
The devils inside the house
can protect you from the outside devils.

1192
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:08,373
What is the guarantee?
The devils inside the house...

1193
01:29:08,407 --> 01:29:09,967
...can sell me to the outside devils.

1194
01:29:10,062 --> 01:29:11,822
I am not such a downtrodden person.

1195
01:29:12,287 --> 01:29:16,522
Until I can sell your art there
is no need for me to sell you.

1196
01:29:16,596 --> 01:29:19,036
What about the day when my
art will not be sold? Then?

1197
01:29:19,085 --> 01:29:22,965
Then? Then for that day my
beautiful Mohini is there.

1198
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:25,411
How can my daughter bear to
see her father wandering...

1199
01:29:25,469 --> 01:29:27,429
...here and there and begging.

1200
01:29:27,516 --> 01:29:29,356
Don't leave me and go my child.

1201
01:29:29,444 --> 01:29:32,764
Beware, don't even try to
look at my child. Come, Mohini!

1202
01:29:33,876 --> 01:29:35,636
Beware, if you take
even a single step ahead.

1203
01:29:37,896 --> 01:29:39,096
Do you know what this is?

1204
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:53,349
It is called an Acid. Acid.

1205
01:29:54,245 --> 01:29:56,125
If you take even a step ahead...

1206
01:29:56,485 --> 01:30:00,485
...then I'll not leave you in a condition
to sell your body or your art.

1207
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:04,820
You can't do that as
I am your source of income.

1208
01:30:04,877 --> 01:30:07,517
The place from where
you get your liquor...

1209
01:30:07,636 --> 01:30:10,036
...and all the luxurious items.

1210
01:30:10,308 --> 01:30:12,708
You don't have that
much guts to finish me.

1211
01:30:15,236 --> 01:30:17,636
I will show you my guts.
-

1212
01:30:36,381 --> 01:30:37,581
Mother!

1213
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:43,878
-

1214
01:30:52,885 --> 01:30:55,165
When the door of
her room was opened...

1215
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:59,820
...in the morning she
had committed suicide.

1216
01:31:01,397 --> 01:31:03,997
But her death didn't
have any effect on father.

1217
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:10,070
My mother's journey had got
over but mine was started.

1218
01:31:12,996 --> 01:31:20,236
I want to end this
journey of yours now itself.

1219
01:31:21,824 --> 01:31:24,940
You go home and come to
the temple along with Jyoti.

1220
01:31:25,909 --> 01:31:27,949
I will call Baban and
my other friends to...

1221
01:31:28,268 --> 01:31:29,628
...make the other preparations.

1222
01:31:30,006 --> 01:31:35,726
But why?
- Why! Idiot, it is our marriage today.

1223
01:31:36,172 --> 01:31:40,532
Now itself, let's go.

1224
01:31:57,613 --> 01:31:58,813
Tell me, where is Munna?

1225
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,980
If he had been in the house...

1226
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,660
...you would have been in hospital,
isn't it?

1227
01:32:06,484 --> 01:32:08,244
Take her to the 'Bangarkhana'.

1228
01:32:08,821 --> 01:32:11,381
Move.

1229
01:32:14,873 --> 01:32:15,873
Leave me.

1230
01:32:18,236 --> 01:32:19,916
They kidnapped Jyoti. Who were they?

1231
01:32:20,517 --> 01:32:22,237
I don't know about it but
it must be my father's move.

1232
01:32:22,293 --> 01:32:23,693
Do you know anything as to
where they have taken her?

1233
01:32:23,892 --> 01:32:24,972
Tell me, where have they taken her?

1234
01:32:25,084 --> 01:32:26,524
They were talking
about some Bangarkhana.

1235
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,780
Baban, you go to the
police station along with her.

1236
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,060
I will look after them.

1237
01:32:50,749 --> 01:32:54,749
Jyoti!

1238
01:32:57,164 --> 01:33:00,084
Jyoti!

1239
01:33:00,293 --> 01:33:07,253
No, leave me.

1240
01:34:19,508 --> 01:34:20,788
You are under arrest.

1241
01:34:20,891 --> 01:34:24,171
This is not a murder, My Lord!
But just an accident...

1242
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:26,900
...which took place while
saving my sister's honour.

1243
01:34:26,956 --> 01:34:30,996
The court and you
Mahesh Deshmukh alias Munna...

1244
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,540
...would be happy to hear
that according to the...

1245
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:37,621
...medical report no rape
took place on your sister.

1246
01:34:38,653 --> 01:34:43,693
You mean that when some
scoundrel tries to rape your...

1247
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:48,820
...sister you should wait until
your sisters virtue is spoilt.

1248
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:51,260
So that you can show
her tarnished virtue...

1249
01:34:51,324 --> 01:34:53,604
...in front of the court as witness.

1250
01:34:55,132 --> 01:34:56,372
Shut up.

1251
01:34:56,868 --> 01:34:58,668
The court doesn't
believe in such speeches but...

1252
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,380
...it believe in evidences.

1253
01:35:01,069 --> 01:35:03,429
Where were you when
your innocent sister...

1254
01:35:03,501 --> 01:35:04,941
...was kidnapped from your house?

1255
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:08,460
I was on the bed
along with your sister.

1256
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,100
You scoundrel!

1257
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:20,060
If the Public Prosecutor can get
so furious just at the thought of...

1258
01:35:20,117 --> 01:35:21,917
...his sister getting raped.

1259
01:35:22,371 --> 01:35:25,131
So can a brother
not commit a murder...

1260
01:35:25,573 --> 01:35:27,453
...when he sees his
sister being raped?

1261
01:35:33,032 --> 01:35:35,740
The court does not have
any doubt that Chhote Khan...

1262
01:35:35,828 --> 01:35:38,868
...was killed my Mahesh
Deshmukh alias Munna.

1263
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:42,340
But taking into consideration
the age of the culprit and...

1264
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:44,276
...the situation when
the murder took place...

1265
01:35:44,325 --> 01:35:46,925
...the court declares one
year imprisonment to Munna.

1266
01:35:47,028 --> 01:35:49,628
And releases the rest
of the associates of...

1267
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:52,341
...the late Chhote Khan
on the basis of doubt.

1268
01:35:52,564 --> 01:35:56,844
This is a sheer injustice.
You are releasing the criminals...

1269
01:35:56,916 --> 01:35:59,076
...and punishing
an innocent man, judge sir.

1270
01:35:59,141 --> 01:36:00,981
What type of justice
is this, judge sir?

1271
01:36:01,069 --> 01:36:03,589
Do not add the stigma of
murderer on my name, judge sir.

1272
01:36:03,652 --> 01:36:07,852
Don't spoil my life,
don't ruin my career, judge sir.

1273
01:36:07,964 --> 01:36:13,284
Take back your judgment,
don't go... Judge sir.

1274
01:36:15,717 --> 01:36:16,397
Brother!

1275
01:36:26,484 --> 01:36:28,164
What will happen now, brother?

1276
01:36:28,581 --> 01:36:30,981
I had asked the same
question to myself...

1277
01:36:31,812 --> 01:36:34,092
...when mother and
father passed away.

1278
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:37,221
And the passing time
gave me its answer.

1279
01:36:37,924 --> 01:36:42,644
How will I live without you
for one year?

1280
01:36:42,693 --> 01:36:46,373
This is just an imprisonment.
Tomorrow they can kill me.

1281
01:36:46,468 --> 01:36:49,388
What will you do then?
Till when will you keep crying?

1282
01:36:49,709 --> 01:36:52,029
Now stop this crying,
you are not a small child...

1283
01:36:52,117 --> 01:36:54,517
...that you always need me.
Be brave, be tough.

1284
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:58,365
Learn to live alone.
- Who will teach me to live alone?

1285
01:36:58,461 --> 01:37:01,821
Life. Life, teaches everything.

1286
01:37:02,478 --> 01:37:04,398
Jyoti, the days of love
and affection have passed.

1287
01:37:04,797 --> 01:37:07,277
You will have to
live and fight against...

1288
01:37:07,342 --> 01:37:09,782
...injustice, betray and crime.

1289
01:37:10,685 --> 01:37:13,525
This is my punishment but
it is yours examination.

1290
01:37:14,133 --> 01:37:15,145
Good luck.

1291
01:37:24,821 --> 01:37:27,061
Just imprisonment of one year.

1292
01:37:27,693 --> 01:37:30,053
Advocate, only one
year imprisonment...

1293
01:37:30,189 --> 01:37:32,189
...for the one who killed
my brother whom I had...

1294
01:37:32,444 --> 01:37:34,444
...nourished for 26 years
as my child.

1295
01:37:34,756 --> 01:37:37,716
This is an injustice,
sheer injustice.

1296
01:37:37,918 --> 01:37:39,758
The punishment for this
murder in your court...

1297
01:37:39,845 --> 01:37:41,605
...might be just one year.

1298
01:37:41,685 --> 01:37:45,125
But only one law rules
in Lotia Pathan's court.

1299
01:37:45,868 --> 01:37:49,548
Eyes against eyes,
hands against hands...

1300
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:55,352
...life against life and
sister against brother.

1301
01:38:30,812 --> 01:38:32,012
Amar! Amar!

1302
01:38:32,069 --> 01:38:35,669
Jyoti... what happened?
-

1303
01:38:35,733 --> 01:38:37,613
They.
- Who?

1304
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:41,276
Idiots, get away.

1305
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:45,653
Scoundrels, don't run,
I will not spare even one of you.

1306
01:38:48,004 --> 01:38:49,684
Cowards.

1307
01:38:57,005 --> 01:38:58,885
While going to jail
Munna had asked me to...

1308
01:38:59,324 --> 01:39:02,724
...take care of you so I came here.

1309
01:39:03,412 --> 01:39:07,852
Don't worry, someone will be
here everyday for your protection.

1310
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:12,780
But bother, we can't stay
24 hours along with Jyoti.

1311
01:39:12,844 --> 01:39:16,644
And Lotia Pathan's men
can do anything at anytime.

1312
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:22,820
There is only one solution for this Lotia.
- What solution?

1313
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:26,340
Shut down all his
business and then...

1314
01:39:26,404 --> 01:39:27,964
...he will automatically run
away from here.

1315
01:39:28,037 --> 01:39:31,997
How is it possible? It is heard
that he runs many casinos.

1316
01:39:32,444 --> 01:39:34,524
The police too don't
know its whereabouts.

1317
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,195
Then how can we find it out?

1318
01:39:40,404 --> 01:39:42,164
We will find out about that too.

1319
01:40:01,612 --> 01:40:04,212
Idiot! He said that to me.

1320
01:40:04,812 --> 01:40:07,932
Don't you have casino,
the place where cards are played.

1321
01:40:08,099 --> 01:40:10,579
Where is the casino in your hotel?

1322
01:40:10,620 --> 01:40:12,100
We don't have a casino in our hotel.

1323
01:40:22,724 --> 01:40:25,004
Sheikh is asking to me
buy this hotel.

1324
01:40:25,077 --> 01:40:28,157
He told me to buy this hotel
and build a casino over here.

1325
01:40:28,236 --> 01:40:31,636
He will play here.
- Sorry sir, it is not possible.

1326
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:33,140
How is it not possible?

1327
01:40:33,356 --> 01:40:37,356
I will slap you with my slipper.

1328
01:40:37,436 --> 01:40:39,316
Hey, this Arab speaks Telugu.

1329
01:40:39,365 --> 01:40:42,525
My some friends are Telugu.
Go and do your work. -

1330
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:56,020
Brother, can I help you?

1331
01:40:56,485 --> 01:41:00,165
I will take you to such a place where
all your desires will be fulfilled.

1332
01:41:00,284 --> 01:41:01,404
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1333
01:41:02,529 --> 01:41:03,597
Come.

1334
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:10,140
Where have your brought us?
It looks like a hospital.

1335
01:41:10,211 --> 01:41:12,651
Prepare a casino,
where is the casino?

1336
01:41:12,732 --> 01:41:14,292
Sir, we will surely
play in the casino, come.

1337
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:18,260
Brother, have patience, there is
a solution for everything here.

1338
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:21,220
Someone might be
winning at every table.

1339
01:41:21,268 --> 01:41:22,988
This is our special room.

1340
01:41:23,045 --> 01:41:25,725
You can play how much you want,
there is no limit over here.

1341
01:41:25,843 --> 01:41:28,603
The Khan says that
this is simply great!

1342
01:41:28,676 --> 01:41:30,356
Great! Great!

1343
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:37,300
Sheikh says that he will play here,
he will play now.

1344
01:41:38,989 --> 01:41:41,789
Sir, this currency
is from your country.

1345
01:41:41,900 --> 01:41:43,500
This currency will
not do in our country.

1346
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:46,196
What are you saying?
This currency will not work?

1347
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,220
You are insulting us, this
currency won't work here?

1348
01:41:49,324 --> 01:41:50,844
No, it won't work.

1349
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:53,516
Come to the hotel at
11:00 am, we will bring...

1350
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:55,805
...Indian currency
and will play here.

1351
01:41:56,236 --> 01:41:57,916
Yes, I will surely come, sure.

1352
01:42:03,612 --> 01:42:06,212
No one will go out. Understood.

1353
01:42:12,317 --> 01:42:14,917
No one will try to run from here.

1354
01:42:17,893 --> 01:42:20,893
It means that my doubt was right.

1355
01:42:20,997 --> 01:42:23,757
Catch him.
- What will you catch me?

1356
01:42:25,949 --> 01:42:28,229
Pandey, run from here.
There is a problem.

1357
01:42:28,305 --> 01:42:31,748
Hello, police station,
there is some fight going on...

1358
01:42:31,805 --> 01:42:34,445
...behind Jetabhai's store
near Hanuman street...

1359
01:42:34,525 --> 01:42:35,725
...you all come immediately.

1360
01:43:06,196 --> 01:43:08,196
Run away, the police have come.

1361
01:43:12,788 --> 01:43:16,828
Till now, I have seen the police
running behind thieves many times...

1362
01:43:16,908 --> 01:43:18,508
...but it is for the time
I am seeing that the...

1363
01:43:18,596 --> 01:43:20,236
...police is running
behind the police.

1364
01:43:20,309 --> 01:43:21,669
Move.

1365
01:43:21,756 --> 01:43:24,556
Hey, lift me.
- Fatty, you always...

1366
01:43:24,644 --> 01:43:26,044
Baban come, fast...

1367
01:43:32,821 --> 01:43:35,141
Yesterday
Chandanwadi police raided...

1368
01:43:35,228 --> 01:43:38,108
...many unauthorized casinos
and found 25 casino machines...

1369
01:43:38,173 --> 01:43:40,213
...and many other
unauthorized materials.

1370
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,180
Lotia Pathan, the owner of
these casinos has escaped.

1371
01:43:43,268 --> 01:43:46,588
Police are searching for him in every
corner of the city. -

1372
01:43:46,677 --> 01:43:47,997
The news ends.

1373
01:44:03,324 --> 01:44:06,164
Lotia king, these
boys have destroyed us.

1374
01:44:06,228 --> 01:44:07,788
Where will we go now king?

1375
01:44:08,044 --> 01:44:10,844
They have ruined us completely.

1376
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:13,756
Whatever Baban did
is my debt on him.

1377
01:44:14,053 --> 01:44:16,293
And Pathan can
leave this world but...

1378
01:44:16,373 --> 01:44:18,173
...cannot leave his debt behind.

1379
01:44:18,292 --> 01:44:21,161
Baban will have to pay this
debt by shedding his blood.

1380
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:29,940
Mohini... whenever I go
to jail to meet Munna...

1381
01:44:30,036 --> 01:44:31,200
...he always asks about you.

1382
01:44:31,277 --> 01:44:34,197
Really.
- He is eager to meet you.

1383
01:44:34,292 --> 01:44:37,452
Mohini, you will
meet him, won't you?

1384
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:13,220
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1385
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:16,420
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1386
01:45:16,564 --> 01:45:20,204
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1387
01:45:20,292 --> 01:45:23,372
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1388
01:45:23,573 --> 01:45:29,093
"I was... I was counting
the days for your return."

1389
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:32,740
"Come my beloved it's spring time."

1390
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:36,300
"I was... I was counting
the days for your return."

1391
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:39,740
"Come my beloved it's spring time."

1392
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:43,780
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1393
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:46,820
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1394
01:45:47,093 --> 01:45:50,893
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1395
01:45:50,996 --> 01:45:53,796
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1396
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:19,460
"I had informed
you on fourteenth..."

1397
01:46:19,733 --> 01:46:23,253
"I had informed you
on the fourteenth..."

1398
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:25,013
"That I would be
coming on fifteenth..."

1399
01:46:25,108 --> 01:46:26,868
"And I had come..."

1400
01:46:26,902 --> 01:46:30,342
"But you didn't come
out on the fifteenth and...

1401
01:46:30,429 --> 01:46:33,869
...I was scared after
not seeing you..."

1402
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:39,270
"On the sixteenth... I was eager
on sixteenth too from morning..."

1403
01:46:39,364 --> 01:46:42,484
"Come my beloved it's spring time."

1404
01:46:42,988 --> 01:46:46,308
"I was counting the
days of your return..."

1405
01:46:46,388 --> 01:46:49,708
"...come back my love
it's the time of spring..."

1406
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,780
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1407
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:56,820
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1408
01:47:11,771 --> 01:47:15,131
"I was not able to sleep for
the whole night on Seventeenth..."

1409
01:47:15,196 --> 01:47:18,916
"You were not seen
on Eighteenth too..."

1410
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:22,556
"I got crazy on the Nineteenth..."

1411
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:26,060
"And I went away from the
house on the Twentieth..."

1412
01:47:26,117 --> 01:47:31,277
"The voice of a crazy man
resonates in streets..."

1413
01:47:31,341 --> 01:47:34,821
"Come my love, its spring..."

1414
01:47:34,933 --> 01:47:38,333
"I was counting the
days of your return..."

1415
01:47:38,412 --> 01:47:41,932
"...come back my love
it's the time of spring..."

1416
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:45,830
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1417
01:47:45,957 --> 01:47:48,780
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1418
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:23,700
Mohini... listen to me.
- This is a library and you are shouting.

1419
01:48:23,771 --> 01:48:24,588
Okay...

1420
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:35,460
"You didn't come on the Twenty
first nor on the Twenty second..."

1421
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:39,100
"You did not meet me on the
Twenty third and Twenty fourth..."

1422
01:48:39,156 --> 01:48:42,436
"Everyone explained
me on Twenty fifth..."

1423
01:48:42,524 --> 01:48:46,004
"Not to allow
Twenty Sixth to pass..."

1424
01:48:46,076 --> 01:48:51,236
"There are only four days
in this world left for me..."

1425
01:48:51,316 --> 01:48:54,596
"Come my love its spring..."

1426
01:48:54,692 --> 01:48:58,292
"I was counting the
days of your return..."

1427
01:48:58,348 --> 01:49:01,708
"...come back my love
it's the time of spring..."

1428
01:49:01,788 --> 01:49:06,188
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1429
01:49:06,269 --> 01:49:08,549
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1430
01:49:16,069 --> 01:49:17,589
"The days were
converted into week... '

1431
01:49:17,693 --> 01:49:19,333
"The weeks were
converted into month..."

1432
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:22,940
"The months were
converted into year..."

1433
01:49:22,981 --> 01:49:29,941
"Just come and see my condition..."

1434
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:33,363
"I am wandering
like a crazy man..."

1435
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:37,060
"Nor I am living nor I am dead..."

1436
01:49:37,132 --> 01:49:40,612
"I am spending a lonely night..."

1437
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:47,460
"Come... Come as I am
counting the days..."

1438
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:56,350
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1439
01:49:56,517 --> 01:49:58,997
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1440
01:49:59,286 --> 01:50:03,046
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1441
01:50:03,173 --> 01:50:06,253
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1442
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:09,853
"I was counting the
days of your return..."

1443
01:50:09,925 --> 01:50:13,205
"...come back my love
it's the time of spring..."

1444
01:50:13,285 --> 01:50:16,925
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1445
01:50:16,966 --> 01:50:19,686
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1446
01:50:46,637 --> 01:50:48,837
Saxena is waiting for
you for the practice.

1447
01:50:48,998 --> 01:50:50,158
All the girls have come.

1448
01:50:50,316 --> 01:50:51,716
And for whom are you waiting here?

1449
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:54,900
Is your husband going to come?
- You are absolutely right.

1450
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:57,740
Munna is being released from jail
today. He will directly come here.

1451
01:50:57,796 --> 01:50:59,636
He will not remain
alive if he comes here.

1452
01:50:59,708 --> 01:51:03,148
Get ready to go.
- I will die but I won't move from here.

1453
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:06,980
You can die for your love but
you can't live for your father.

1454
01:51:07,093 --> 01:51:09,133
I will see how you do not come.
- I am not going to dance today.

1455
01:51:09,197 --> 01:51:11,037
How come you will not dance,
your father too will dance.

1456
01:51:11,148 --> 01:51:13,148
Leave me.
- Move.

1457
01:51:15,189 --> 01:51:18,469
Munna will never reach up
to this house, understood.

1458
01:51:21,917 --> 01:51:26,397
You will rot here until
you don't agree to dance.

1459
01:51:26,843 --> 01:51:28,309
I will see how many
days will you survive...

1460
01:51:28,389 --> 01:51:29,989
...without food and water.

1461
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:50,480
Mohini!

1462
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,920
Hey, how did you come inside?

1463
01:51:52,015 --> 01:51:53,575
What do you want? Get out.

1464
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:54,720
Get side.
- Don't show your hooliganism here.

1465
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:56,551
Mohini!
- I will trap you in such a way that...

1466
01:51:56,632 --> 01:51:57,872
...you will remember me.

1467
01:51:57,944 --> 01:52:02,064
Move from my way, take your money.
- My money...

1468
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,080
Mohini!
- Why are you shouting?

1469
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:06,040
You will never get Mohini.
- Mohini!

1470
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:07,880
Why are you shouting for Mohini?

1471
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:09,480
Answer me, Mohini.

1472
01:52:10,072 --> 01:52:12,832
Shout loudly.
- Mohini!

1473
01:52:13,057 --> 01:52:14,417
Mohini.

1474
01:52:16,714 --> 01:52:19,074
Mohini!
- Money...

1475
01:52:21,073 --> 01:52:25,753
Shyamlal, you can't keep us
away for long from each other now.

1476
01:52:25,825 --> 01:52:28,825
Even if you have
hidden her underground...

1477
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:31,800
...then too I will tear off
the ground and find her.

1478
01:52:36,129 --> 01:52:40,729
Munna, you have come.
I knew that you would come.

1479
01:52:41,849 --> 01:52:45,009
Father used to say that you
would never be able to find me.

1480
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:50,280
But I was sure that
you would find me.

1481
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:55,400
Munna, you won't
leave me alone, will you?

1482
01:52:55,767 --> 01:52:58,912
You stupid girl, your Munna
is never going to come back.

1483
01:52:59,368 --> 01:53:00,488
What has happened to my Munna?

1484
01:53:00,592 --> 01:53:03,312
It is heard that someone has
killed him mercilessly. - It is a lie.

1485
01:53:03,376 --> 01:53:05,176
Munna is dead.
- No.

1486
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:07,160
First of all his fingers
were slashed one by one.

1487
01:53:07,264 --> 01:53:09,264
If you had been there
you would have seen that...

1488
01:53:09,313 --> 01:53:11,193
...instead of his finger
there was only flesh. - No.

1489
01:53:11,257 --> 01:53:13,057
Then his legs were slashed,
he was crying for mercy...

1490
01:53:13,122 --> 01:53:15,602
...to not to make him disabled.

1491
01:53:15,689 --> 01:53:17,369
But just with a single
shot of an axe the...

1492
01:53:17,449 --> 01:53:19,809
...five feet ten inch Munna turned into
three feet and two inch. - No.

1493
01:53:19,881 --> 01:53:22,521
And at last when the axe was
slashed on Munna's chest...

1494
01:53:22,609 --> 01:53:24,689
...he was in agony and was
taking only one name and...

1495
01:53:24,754 --> 01:53:26,274
...that is Mohini...
- No.

1496
01:53:26,361 --> 01:53:28,521
If you had been there
you would have seen that...

1497
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:30,730
...the blood from his
body spread on the road...

1498
01:53:30,857 --> 01:53:32,177
...and was wasted.

1499
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,560
I removed him from here.
- Why?

1500
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:41,880
That scoundrel destroyed my shop.

1501
01:53:42,545 --> 01:53:45,265
Everyone used to praise
him and used to have...

1502
01:53:45,376 --> 01:53:47,576
...tea and snacks free of cost.

1503
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,240
He spent my hundred
and forty five rupees.

1504
01:53:50,616 --> 01:53:53,456
If I see him here,
I will break his legs.

1505
01:53:53,528 --> 01:53:56,928
Munna brother.
- You came back here again.

1506
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,600
Look sir, I am here
as a customer and...

1507
01:53:59,664 --> 01:54:02,584
...If I ask for tea then I
am ready to pay for it too.

1508
01:54:02,657 --> 01:54:04,137
Take the money.
- Give.

1509
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:07,135
Won't you have some breakfast, sir?

1510
01:54:07,183 --> 01:54:09,423
Give me two omelets.
- Ten rupees.

1511
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,520
You will not get breakfast or tea.

1512
01:54:12,729 --> 01:54:15,329
Now the balance left is
one hundred and thirty five rupees.

1513
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,360
Munna brother, I was searching you.

1514
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,840
I had even gone to your house.
- Why?

1515
01:54:26,264 --> 01:54:29,304
You are searching for Mohini, isn't it?
- Yes.

1516
01:54:29,384 --> 01:54:31,824
I know where Mohini is.
- Mohini!

1517
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,200
How did you come to know?

1518
01:54:35,272 --> 01:54:38,232
They have imprisoned
Mohini in the house...

1519
01:54:38,304 --> 01:54:40,544
...next to the place where I work.

1520
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,080
Throw the card!

1521
01:54:45,528 --> 01:54:48,408
Take this brother.
- What is the point?

1522
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:53,120
Twenty thousand cash... Credit
doesn't work while playing cards.

1523
01:55:18,258 --> 01:55:19,618
You have come here again to beat me.

1524
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,840
Why don't you kill me?

1525
01:55:22,896 --> 01:55:27,656
I want to die...
Why don't you kill me?

1526
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,680
The way you killed my Munna.

1527
01:55:31,066 --> 01:55:35,906
But I am not going to dance...
Kill me.

1528
01:55:36,115 --> 01:55:39,875
I don't want to live
without Munna, kill me.

1529
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:46,321
I don't want to live,
I beg of you, kill me.

1530
01:55:46,691 --> 01:55:50,171
I don't want to live, I want to die.

1531
01:55:50,227 --> 01:55:53,187
Mohini...
- Don't touch me.

1532
01:55:53,323 --> 01:55:54,923
Mohini, I am Munna.

1533
01:55:54,986 --> 01:55:58,146
Don't touch me, leave me.
- I am your Munna, Mohini...

1534
01:55:59,728 --> 01:56:03,688
Munna! You are Munna.
- Yes.

1535
01:56:03,745 --> 01:56:04,585
Munna.

1536
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:09,040
Munna.

1537
01:56:13,258 --> 01:56:15,138
I thought that they killed you.

1538
01:56:23,987 --> 01:56:26,707
But how did you come to
know that I am trapped here.

1539
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:30,670
That Guldasta... that man from
the canteen told me about you.

1540
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,680
That singer.
- Yes.

1541
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:36,640
But few days ago I saw him
talking to my father.

1542
01:56:38,281 --> 01:56:39,961
Guldasta.
- Yes.

1543
01:56:41,425 --> 01:56:46,105
Open the door.
- It seem that there is some danger here.

1544
01:56:46,184 --> 01:56:48,424
It is surely some one's plan.
- Wait I will see.

1545
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:49,960
No...
- I will break the door.

1546
01:56:51,025 --> 01:56:54,305
I am scared. I have passed
one year in very difficulty.

1547
01:56:54,689 --> 01:56:57,929
If something happens to you then
I won't be able to live alone.

1548
01:56:58,208 --> 01:56:59,968
I will kill myself.

1549
01:57:00,111 --> 01:57:02,391
But how can I...
- I don't want to listen to anything.

1550
01:57:02,472 --> 01:57:06,312
Go, please. You have
my oath, go from here.

1551
01:57:08,857 --> 01:57:11,177
Hey girl, open the door.
- Go.

1552
01:57:16,025 --> 01:57:18,385
You go away.
-  Constable, break the door!

1553
01:57:18,449 --> 01:57:19,689
I will come back, Mohini.

1554
01:57:22,944 --> 01:57:25,144
You have literally
killed me, Mr. Shyamlal.

1555
01:57:25,216 --> 01:57:26,816
I did many things for you.

1556
01:57:26,849 --> 01:57:29,049
I continuously gave you
news about Munna and Mohini.

1557
01:57:29,145 --> 01:57:30,225
I trapped Munna.

1558
01:57:30,273 --> 01:57:32,393
But leave alone
Laxminikant Pyarelal...

1559
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:34,458
...you didn't even
introduced me to an Orchestra party.

1560
01:57:34,545 --> 01:57:36,985
I will introduce you.
- What are you going to introduce now?

1561
01:57:37,105 --> 01:57:39,225
Yesterday night Munna
fooled the police and escaped.

1562
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:41,759
It is heard that he is
after me to kill me.

1563
01:57:41,823 --> 01:57:43,743
Why are you so scared?

1564
01:57:44,217 --> 01:57:46,897
A case of robbery has
been filed against him.

1565
01:57:46,977 --> 01:57:48,297
And police is after him.

1566
01:57:48,705 --> 01:57:50,185
And if you are so scared then...

1567
01:57:50,312 --> 01:57:52,563
...take this money
and go to your village.

1568
01:57:52,618 --> 01:57:56,458
No Shyamlal, Guldasta will
not go to his native place...

1569
01:57:56,521 --> 01:57:58,121
...but he will be going
to the police station.

1570
01:57:58,209 --> 01:57:59,729
You have ruined me.

1571
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,200
He is the proof that I am innocent.

1572
01:58:04,689 --> 01:58:06,889
Ask him what the truth is.

1573
01:58:07,639 --> 01:58:11,399
What is this?
- Sir, don't beat me. I am singer.

1574
01:58:11,457 --> 01:58:17,177
Sir, I will tell you everything.
Shyamlal has done all this.

1575
01:58:17,272 --> 01:58:18,512
Ask him...

1576
01:58:18,601 --> 01:58:21,001
Raj Gopal.
- Yes sir.

1577
01:58:21,064 --> 01:58:22,344
Take his statement.

1578
01:58:22,825 --> 01:58:24,825
Come...
- I will tell you everything.

1579
01:58:24,999 --> 01:58:28,719
Where are you taking me? - Have a seat.
- Sir, you don't know...

1580
01:58:29,936 --> 01:58:32,736
...what a rogue this Shyamlal is.
- Is it?

1581
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,080
Last year he...
-

1582
01:58:41,753 --> 01:58:45,033
Inspector sir, this
is Guldasta shouting.

1583
01:58:45,121 --> 01:58:48,441
Don't shout! This is a police station
not a college canteen.

1584
01:58:48,537 --> 01:58:51,177
They are beating him,
this is wrong, sir.

1585
01:58:51,233 --> 01:58:54,593
We know very well that what
is right and what is wrong.

1586
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:57,400
But is this a new law to
beat a witness while...

1587
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:58,904
...taking his statement?

1588
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,280
Shut up.
- How can you do this to him? How?

1589
01:59:02,368 --> 01:59:05,288
Sir, this is his statement.
And he has accepted his crime.

1590
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:11,992
And this is the money which he stole
from Munna and Shyamlal's house.

1591
01:59:12,056 --> 01:59:13,856
What is this going on, Sir?
- Keep quiet.

1592
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,920
Put this rogue behind the bars.

1593
01:59:15,992 --> 01:59:20,192
Idiot. - You scoundrel, you are
trying to trap me in a crime...

1594
01:59:20,264 --> 01:59:22,064
...which I have not committed.

1595
01:59:22,129 --> 01:59:24,769
You have taken bribe from Shyamlal...

1596
01:59:24,809 --> 01:59:27,049
...you have taken the bribe
from Shyamlal. Get side.

1597
01:59:27,106 --> 01:59:30,306
Tell me, whether you
have taken the bribe or not.

1598
01:59:30,577 --> 01:59:37,097
People like you are
destroying this country... Get side.

1599
01:59:37,953 --> 01:59:41,793
Inspector... I won't leave you.
- Leave him.

1600
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:45,730
I won't leave you.
- Leave me.

1601
01:59:45,849 --> 01:59:49,609
Get side. Leave me.

1602
01:59:53,720 --> 01:59:54,800
I won't leave you.

1603
01:59:54,864 --> 01:59:57,064
Shut up, tie him up.

1604
01:59:57,144 --> 02:00:00,344
Inspector, you come out ...
You come out.

1605
02:00:00,432 --> 02:00:03,112
I will go out, you rascal!

1606
02:00:03,168 --> 02:00:06,848
Shut up! You come out and then I
will show you. - Get back.

1607
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,760
I will show you, you are
raising your hands on me.

1608
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,440
Tie him up.

1609
02:00:17,721 --> 02:00:19,361
You are raising your
hands on the police?

1610
02:00:19,441 --> 02:00:23,841
You scoundrel, you are
going to beat me with belt.

1611
02:00:27,833 --> 02:00:32,953
After the statement of witness,
evidences and investigations...

1612
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:35,065
...the court has
reached the conclusion that...

1613
02:00:35,121 --> 02:00:39,001
...Mahesh Deshmukh alias Munna
reached Mulchand Kochar's house...

1614
02:00:39,089 --> 02:00:42,569
...on the night of 14th
February with an intension to rob,...

1615
02:00:42,945 --> 02:00:46,305
...where he
deceived the police and escaped.

1616
02:00:46,408 --> 02:00:51,048
Then on the 15th February in
broad day light he robbed...

1617
02:00:51,097 --> 02:00:55,097
...Shyamlal's house along with his
friend Abbas Ali alias Guldasta.

1618
02:00:55,400 --> 02:01:00,120
The court gives one
year imprisonment to...

1619
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:02,880
...Abbas Ali alias Guldasta.

1620
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:07,560
And Munna the one who is
a terror to this city...

1621
02:01:07,687 --> 02:01:10,527
...is ordered to be banished.

1622
02:01:10,721 --> 02:01:13,281
He will not be allowed
to enter this city...

1623
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:15,920
...during this one year period.

1624
02:01:28,561 --> 02:01:30,561
Now at least you believe me that...

1625
02:01:31,353 --> 02:01:33,553
...why I don't have faith
in your profession.

1626
02:01:38,361 --> 02:01:42,504
But I will be happy
if I bring back your faith.

1627
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,560
But you will have to
pay a price for it...

1628
02:01:44,608 --> 02:01:47,648
I am ready to pay anything
to convert banished Munna...

1629
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,760
...into Mahesh Deshmukh again.

1630
02:01:50,008 --> 02:01:52,288
Then give me twenty four hours time.

1631
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:56,040
You have faith in me and
I will have faith in you.

1632
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:02,240
Okay, I will wait for you.
Stop the vehicle.

1633
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:06,586
Best of luck.

1634
02:02:41,107 --> 02:02:44,067
It is very difficult to find
Mohini in such a big place.

1635
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,180
I don't know in which
dark cell will she be?

1636
02:02:47,837 --> 02:02:51,557
We will do one thing,
we all will spread in this area.

1637
02:02:52,266 --> 02:02:54,746
The one who will first
get information about...

1638
02:02:54,980 --> 02:02:56,820
...Mohini will inform all of us.

1639
02:03:56,409 --> 02:03:58,066
- What is going on?

1640
02:03:58,133 --> 02:04:00,175
Sir, this boy tried to run
from here yesterday night...

1641
02:04:00,242 --> 02:04:02,042
...and was saying that
he won't lift the load.

1642
02:04:03,432 --> 02:04:06,872
You scoundrel, you
are beating a child.

1643
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,960
They have found Mohini!

1644
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:18,720
Catch him.

1645
02:04:26,556 --> 02:04:28,356
You wait here, I will just be back.

1646
02:05:27,125 --> 02:05:29,725
Pascal! Anthony!

1647
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:10,120
Run childrens, run with me fast...

1648
02:06:19,574 --> 02:06:20,974
She might be somewhere over here.

1649
02:06:21,053 --> 02:06:24,373
If she runs from here then
I won't leave any of you. Go.

1650
02:06:48,202 --> 02:06:50,122
Come out...

1651
02:06:57,610 --> 02:07:02,290
You will not be able to
go alive from my place.

1652
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:07,368
I will go, I will surely go and
you will take him out from here.

1653
02:07:07,483 --> 02:07:08,538
Come...

1654
02:07:19,565 --> 02:07:22,765
Hey, get back,
if you show your smartness then...

1655
02:07:22,854 --> 02:07:26,982
...I will kill the Pathan
with this knife. Move!

1656
02:07:27,054 --> 02:07:29,014
Hey boys, run from here.

1657
02:07:37,685 --> 02:07:41,165
Munna, your enemy too
will praise your bravery.

1658
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:43,760
Because not even a needle
can go out of this city...

1659
02:07:43,804 --> 02:07:47,204
...without my permission
and you are taking this girl.

1660
02:07:48,182 --> 02:07:50,582
I am not only taking
this girl from here...

1661
02:07:53,441 --> 02:07:57,441
I will burn your kingdom to
ashes and then go from here.

1662
02:07:59,462 --> 02:08:01,102
Stop him.

1663
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:25,920
The vehicle is not working,
it would had been better...

1664
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,880
...if someone had
pushed it from back.

1665
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:31,840
We have won, Hail to children's...

1666
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:46,520
Is it so?

1667
02:09:39,427 --> 02:09:42,587
Go, you all are free, go fast...

1668
02:09:51,106 --> 02:09:55,004
There will be only one aim
in Lotia Pathan's life...

1669
02:09:55,093 --> 02:09:59,693
...from today and
that is Munna's death.

1670
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:09,300
Munna!

1671
02:10:13,389 --> 02:10:15,534
I will not let you separate from me.

1672
02:10:15,623 --> 02:10:18,183
Not even for a moment.

1673
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:20,040
You don't know how...

1674
02:10:20,232 --> 02:10:23,792
...tough it was for me
to pass this one year.

1675
02:10:24,255 --> 02:10:26,655
I was not able to
sleep even for a moment...

1676
02:10:27,215 --> 02:10:32,015
...as I got the habit of
fainting after the beatings.

1677
02:10:32,166 --> 02:10:36,495
I want to leave everything,
that dance, that song...

1678
02:10:36,575 --> 02:10:38,775
...that house, that fame,
that money everything.

1679
02:10:38,877 --> 02:10:40,517
Have you gone crazy?

1680
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:43,960
There is nothing in you except...

1681
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:47,360
...your fame, money and house
that I should take you with me.

1682
02:10:50,495 --> 02:10:52,615
What are you saying, Munna?

1683
02:10:52,675 --> 02:10:54,275
The same thing that
you are listening.

1684
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:56,880
If you can't give me a
luxurious life then...

1685
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:58,480
...what is the use of your love?

1686
02:10:59,040 --> 02:10:59,960
What?

1687
02:11:00,714 --> 02:11:02,354
Is it for this why you loved me?

1688
02:11:02,469 --> 02:11:05,909
If your own father
has the greed of money.

1689
02:11:06,618 --> 02:11:08,658
Then what is wrong if
even I have the lust for it?

1690
02:11:10,025 --> 02:11:11,006
What do you want?

1691
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,940
The same thing what
your father wants.

1692
02:11:13,222 --> 02:11:15,622
You should dance,
sing and earn money.

1693
02:11:15,736 --> 02:11:18,896
I will have the right on
it as much I have on you.

1694
02:11:19,002 --> 02:11:25,362
You are lying.
- What is there to lie? This is the truth.

1695
02:11:26,453 --> 02:11:29,533
After completing one year
punishment of banishment...

1696
02:11:29,612 --> 02:11:32,052
...and staying along with rogues...

1697
02:11:32,158 --> 02:11:34,478
...I have understood the real
kind of this world, Mohini.

1698
02:11:35,612 --> 02:11:38,092
Nor the love and nor the
dreams come in use in this world.

1699
02:11:39,693 --> 02:11:43,293
I too loved my dreams
but what did I find.

1700
02:11:43,869 --> 02:11:46,004
I used to think that my
dreams are in my clutches.

1701
02:11:46,501 --> 02:11:49,781
But I didn't know when it
slipped out of my hand as sand.

1702
02:11:50,287 --> 02:11:55,247
This is the truth. The same
way your Munna too has changed.

1703
02:11:55,536 --> 02:11:58,096
His dreams have also changed,
this is the truth.

1704
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,840
Now his dream is to be rich,
and to get all the...

1705
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:03,160
...luxuries of this world.

1706
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:07,560
And he will do anything to get this.

1707
02:12:34,782 --> 02:12:41,302
"The world is tranquil...
the sky is tranquil."

1708
02:12:41,365 --> 02:12:47,725
"The world is tranquil...
the sky is tranquil."

1709
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:56,792
"All the destinations
have become quiet."

1710
02:12:56,878 --> 02:12:59,038
"This path too is silent."

1711
02:12:59,674 --> 02:13:06,074
"The world is tranquil...
the sky is tranquil."

1712
02:13:06,312 --> 02:13:15,072
"All the destinations
have become quiet."

1713
02:13:15,152 --> 02:13:17,352
"This path too is silent."

1714
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:25,040
"The world is tranquil...
the sky is tranquil."

1715
02:14:04,360 --> 02:14:09,080
"As the night came, the
one who had shelters...

1716
02:14:09,134 --> 02:14:12,894
...went to sleep"

1717
02:14:14,318 --> 02:14:20,398
"As the night came,
loafers like us came out...

1718
02:14:20,530 --> 02:14:24,130
...and were lost..."

1719
02:14:25,837 --> 02:14:32,117
"This street, that street...
This place, that place..."

1720
02:14:32,522 --> 02:14:38,242
"Where could we go even
if we would like to go..."

1721
02:14:38,338 --> 02:14:47,418
"All the destinations
have become quiet."

1722
02:14:47,667 --> 02:14:50,067
"This path too is silent..."

1723
02:14:50,775 --> 02:14:57,055
"This world is tranquil...
The sky too is tranquil..."

1724
02:14:57,313 --> 02:15:03,633
"This world is tranquil...
The sky too is tranquil..."

1725
02:16:06,459 --> 02:16:12,299
"Listen something about me...
Tell something about yourself..."

1726
02:16:12,974 --> 02:16:19,494
"Don't be quiet
when close to me..."

1727
02:16:19,617 --> 02:16:26,097
"I am close to you
and even far from you..."

1728
02:16:26,175 --> 02:16:32,735
"I am free too and
even helpless too..."

1729
02:16:32,859 --> 02:16:39,219
"Why this season of
love passed away..."

1730
02:16:39,322 --> 02:16:45,882
"Why has the world
won against us..."

1731
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:52,560
"My heart is always sad..."

1732
02:16:52,958 --> 02:17:05,318
"And the life is in
complete darkness..."

1733
02:17:05,407 --> 02:17:14,687
"All the destinations are quiet"

1734
02:17:15,046 --> 02:17:17,646
"This path too is silent..."

1735
02:17:18,094 --> 02:17:24,583
"This world is tranquil...
The sky too is tranquil..."

1736
02:17:24,642 --> 02:17:31,042
"This world is tranquil...
The sky too is tranquil..."

1737
02:17:49,859 --> 02:17:53,579
Hey, old man, take your girl.
- My dear has come.

1738
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:56,760
And give me my money.
- Money? Which money?

1739
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:58,680
Cash Fifty thousand.

1740
02:18:00,845 --> 02:18:02,885
Do you remember it or will I
have to make you remember?

1741
02:18:02,965 --> 02:18:04,365
What will you make me remember?

1742
02:18:04,436 --> 02:18:07,236
Shyamlal, there is no use of
quarrelling with such people.

1743
02:18:07,291 --> 02:18:10,251
Give him the money.
- Money! I should pay it.

1744
02:18:10,565 --> 02:18:11,445
From where should I bring the money?

1745
02:18:11,498 --> 02:18:13,498
That day I had given you
fifty thousand rupees...

1746
02:18:13,561 --> 02:18:16,121
...as he was going to
come with Mohini and...

1747
02:18:16,219 --> 02:18:17,579
...we had to pay him or
else he would fight.

1748
02:18:17,693 --> 02:18:18,653
Didn't I give you the money?

1749
02:18:18,692 --> 02:18:20,212
You might have given
but I have spent I now.

1750
02:18:20,342 --> 02:18:21,582
I don't have it now,
we will pay you...

1751
02:18:21,627 --> 02:18:22,747
...as we get it,
now you go from here.

1752
02:18:22,844 --> 02:18:25,644
Hey Shyamlal, enough of this drama.

1753
02:18:25,996 --> 02:18:28,916
You daughter has come,
now give me my money quietly.

1754
02:18:29,013 --> 02:18:31,373
What will you do if I don't pay you?

1755
02:18:39,071 --> 02:18:42,951
Unless I don't get the money
this girl will stay with me.

1756
02:18:43,369 --> 02:18:44,889
Give me the money and take her away.

1757
02:18:45,027 --> 02:18:46,947
Someone stop him.
- Wait.

1758
02:18:48,030 --> 02:18:51,830
I will pay you the money,
take this and count it.

1759
02:18:52,343 --> 02:18:55,023
You amount will never
be wrong, Saxena sir.

1760
02:18:56,846 --> 02:18:58,629
Do call me if you
have any other work.

1761
02:18:58,726 --> 02:18:59,766
Sure, why not?

1762
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:10,480
You disgraced yourself so
much in front of Mohini.

1763
02:19:10,605 --> 02:19:12,525
Why are you
punishing yourself brother?

1764
02:19:12,579 --> 02:19:14,859
What else would I have done?
- You could have accepted her.

1765
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:17,010
She would have got a house and I
would have got a sister-in-law.

1766
02:19:17,107 --> 02:19:18,187
This is impossible, Jyoti.

1767
02:19:18,268 --> 02:19:20,068
Okay, I will make it
possible which you...

1768
02:19:20,156 --> 02:19:21,316
...feel is impossible.

1769
02:19:21,404 --> 02:19:24,604
I will tell her the truth and
then I will see how you ignore her.

1770
02:19:26,847 --> 02:19:30,407
Don't act like a fool, you
want to give her a house.

1771
02:19:30,916 --> 02:19:32,596
Saxena too can give that to her.

1772
02:19:32,685 --> 02:19:35,365
I am banished, police is after me.

1773
02:19:35,462 --> 02:19:37,662
I don't have enough
space to run then...

1774
02:19:37,733 --> 02:19:39,173
...how come will I give her a house?

1775
02:19:40,916 --> 02:19:42,596
I will always regret that...

1776
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:44,960
...I was not able to
give you a sister-in-law.

1777
02:19:45,491 --> 02:19:48,171
And what about love?
- There will be love...

1778
02:19:48,294 --> 02:19:52,374
As hatred in her heart
and as a wound in my heart.

1779
02:20:04,827 --> 02:20:05,865
Sir.

1780
02:20:14,452 --> 02:20:16,292
Sir, I have fulfilled my promise.

1781
02:20:20,149 --> 02:20:23,520
My lord, the one who
has been brought...

1782
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:27,880
...in front of you has not
only violated the rule of...

1783
02:20:28,062 --> 02:20:32,302
...banishment order, but he
has done many other crimes too.

1784
02:20:33,451 --> 02:20:36,996
My lord, Munna has not
learnt a lesson even after...

1785
02:20:37,068 --> 02:20:39,254
...being imprisoned for
one year in a murder case.

1786
02:20:39,924 --> 02:20:43,244
An unsuccessful robbery in
Mr. Kochar's farm house.

1787
02:20:43,956 --> 02:20:46,116
Robbery in Mr. Shyamlal's
house along with his...

1788
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:47,880
...companion Guldasta.

1789
02:20:49,125 --> 02:20:53,445
An attack on the
capable Inspector Gupta.

1790
02:20:53,943 --> 02:20:57,623
It seems that this
man is in a war with...

1791
02:20:57,693 --> 02:21:01,082
...the innocent and
good people of this city.

1792
02:21:01,198 --> 02:21:03,878
These murderers are of
such a type that their...

1793
02:21:03,926 --> 02:21:05,735
...customs and
traditions is to perform crime.

1794
02:21:05,965 --> 02:21:10,005
My lord, such murderers should
be kept far from the society.

1795
02:21:10,307 --> 02:21:13,707
He is such an acid that
if he comes out then...

1796
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:16,280
...he will burn the whole society.

1797
02:21:16,325 --> 02:21:20,445
Yes, I am an acid...

1798
02:21:23,410 --> 02:21:25,610
I accept that I am an acid
but I want to ask that...

1799
02:21:25,751 --> 02:21:28,871
...from where did
this acid come from?

1800
02:21:29,080 --> 02:21:31,160
To you, to the
public prosecutor and...

1801
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:34,400
...all of you who are sitting here.

1802
02:21:34,445 --> 02:21:37,885
I want to ask that where
did this acid come from.

1803
02:21:39,276 --> 02:21:42,676
My lord, this acid did not
take birth in my mother's stomach.

1804
02:21:42,782 --> 02:21:45,142
The one who had
taken an oath to die...

1805
02:21:45,213 --> 02:21:47,613
...for the society and
country in the uniform of NCC...

1806
02:21:47,676 --> 02:21:50,876
...the one who had fulfilled
those promise even after...

1807
02:21:50,956 --> 02:21:53,796
...endangering his life and
losing his parents that acid is me.

1808
02:21:54,218 --> 02:21:58,138
Mahesh Deshmukh was
not an acid, My Lord.

1809
02:22:10,582 --> 02:22:14,782
Julie, give me a glass,
here is mine move of Five hundred.

1810
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:20,360
What is going on Gupta?
- Nothing, just a time pass.

1811
02:22:20,587 --> 02:22:22,107
When a duty becomes time pass and...

1812
02:22:22,179 --> 02:22:24,419
...a gambler instead of
being scared of a policemen...

1813
02:22:24,516 --> 02:22:26,516
...plays along with him,
then not only money...

1814
02:22:26,862 --> 02:22:31,822
...is placed in the bet but
the fate of the country too is placed.

1815
02:22:32,485 --> 02:22:35,485
What do you want to prove Gagan Singh?
- Nothing.

1816
02:22:37,601 --> 02:22:39,161
You had shown the
power of the police and...

1817
02:22:39,294 --> 02:22:40,934
...had proved the truth as lie.

1818
02:22:41,005 --> 02:22:42,885
Today I am going to
show the same power and...

1819
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:44,320
...prove the lie as truth.

1820
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:46,440
Which lie, which truth?

1821
02:22:48,219 --> 02:22:51,459
Look at this belt, do
you remember anything?

1822
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:11,600
I don't remember anything, pack.
I will move now.

1823
02:23:11,724 --> 02:23:15,844
Wait Inspector,
you will remember everything.

1824
02:23:16,596 --> 02:23:19,156
This belt will make
you remember everything.

1825
02:23:19,236 --> 02:23:21,316
Inspector, I too have a belt.

1826
02:23:21,413 --> 02:23:24,213
Only a belt is not enough,
the hands which are...

1827
02:23:24,423 --> 02:23:28,783
...used to taking bribe
and betraying their duty...

1828
02:23:28,873 --> 02:23:32,353
...don't have the
power to lift their belt.

1829
02:23:35,287 --> 02:23:39,207
Which innocent boy you had
beaten with this belt? - Munna.

1830
02:23:39,987 --> 02:23:43,987
What you had done with him?
- I had trapped him.

1831
02:23:44,068 --> 02:23:47,228
How did you trap him?
- By false witness.

1832
02:23:47,351 --> 02:23:48,951
Whose false witness?

1833
02:23:52,256 --> 02:23:56,016
Guldasta's. - How did you
made him give false witness?

1834
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,200
By beating him.

1835
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:05,300
Gupta, you memory is sharper
than a wild elephant.

1836
02:24:05,852 --> 02:24:08,612
Keep this memory intact
till you reach the court.

1837
02:24:08,745 --> 02:24:10,465
It will be better for you.

1838
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:15,040
My lord, I have told you
everything that I remembered.

1839
02:24:15,637 --> 02:24:18,557
Munna... is innocent.

1840
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:23,320
But I proved him
criminal for the greed of money.

1841
02:24:23,934 --> 02:24:28,174
Taking into consideration the
witness of Inspector Gupta...

1842
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:31,720
...the court takes back the
allegations made on Munna...

1843
02:24:31,782 --> 02:24:34,102
...alias Mahesh Deshmukh.

1844
02:24:34,246 --> 02:24:39,813
And orders to take action
against Inspector Gupta.

1845
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:46,920
Look Munna, this country,
society is yours even after...

1846
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:50,920
...all the injustice is done to you.

1847
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:53,440
Your father sacrificed
his life for this country.

1848
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:57,440
You can't go anywhere by
getting upset with it.

1849
02:24:57,587 --> 02:25:00,587
What can I do alone?
- Everything can be done alone.

1850
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:02,400
Everyone waits that
someone else will do it...

1851
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:03,840
...some organization will do it,
some society will do it...

1852
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:04,840
...government will do it or
some society will do it.

1853
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:06,960
And no one do
anything except waiting.

1854
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,840
How is it possible for me
in this city along with...

1855
02:25:10,626 --> 02:25:12,866
...the stigma of murder,
robbery and banishment.

1856
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:16,720
Not here, In Goa, my friend
has a shipping factory there.

1857
02:25:16,773 --> 02:25:18,733
I have spoke to him about you.

1858
02:25:18,874 --> 02:25:22,554
You go there and start a new life.

1859
02:25:22,711 --> 02:25:25,991
Come on Mahesh, cheer up.
That's better, come.

1860
02:25:29,979 --> 02:25:33,139
Guldasta you, come, come inside.

1861
02:25:35,002 --> 02:25:36,762
How come you came here?

1862
02:25:37,880 --> 02:25:39,400
I have come here to
ask for forgiveness.

1863
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:42,200
Baban said that you are
leaving this city and...

1864
02:25:42,739 --> 02:25:43,764
...are going to Goa.

1865
02:25:46,205 --> 02:25:48,165
This city gave me the name Munna.

1866
02:25:48,952 --> 02:25:52,072
The same city gave
another name of Banished.

1867
02:25:52,556 --> 02:25:56,636
Getting free from that,
I am going to start...

1868
02:25:57,494 --> 02:25:59,574
...a new life with a new name.

1869
02:25:59,644 --> 02:26:03,924
Leaving Mohini!
- Everything which this city had given me.

1870
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:06,480
Friends too and enemies too.

1871
02:26:07,071 --> 02:26:11,791
I won't let you go
without Mohini, no way.

1872
02:26:18,494 --> 02:26:21,254
Only relations stop a human being.

1873
02:26:21,870 --> 02:26:23,630
And I don't have any relation.

1874
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:29,440
You have one relation
and I will surely try to save it.

1875
02:26:30,694 --> 02:26:33,694
There is nothing in
between me and Munna...

1876
02:26:33,765 --> 02:26:35,245
...to be saved, understood.

1877
02:26:35,623 --> 02:26:39,943
No Mohini, I have
seen in Munna's eyes...

1878
02:26:40,406 --> 02:26:42,246
...whatever is left
between you and him.

1879
02:26:42,380 --> 02:26:44,780
What did you see?
The desire for money.

1880
02:26:45,526 --> 02:26:48,686
I am not Mohini for him,
I am a girl of an old man.

1881
02:26:48,801 --> 02:26:51,201
And he made a deal with
my father for my release...

1882
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:53,504
...and threw me from one
hell to the other hell.

1883
02:26:54,869 --> 02:26:59,909
I gave up myself to
him with lots of faith.

1884
02:27:00,868 --> 02:27:02,828
I loved him forgetting myself.

1885
02:27:03,575 --> 02:27:07,175
But he used me for his profit.

1886
02:27:07,477 --> 02:27:09,957
He trampled my feelings.

1887
02:27:10,046 --> 02:27:13,446
I hate him, I hate his thought.

1888
02:27:13,526 --> 02:27:15,766
I hate him.
-

1889
02:27:16,340 --> 02:27:20,700
This is what he wanted that
you should start hating him.

1890
02:27:21,949 --> 02:27:26,869
Yes Mohini, he knew that
how much he loved you...

1891
02:27:27,123 --> 02:27:29,243
...that much you too loved him.

1892
02:27:30,253 --> 02:27:35,053
And he knew that you
won't marry someone else...

1893
02:27:35,444 --> 02:27:37,764
...unless you don't hate him.

1894
02:27:38,566 --> 02:27:42,206
He was ready to see you as
a queen in Saxena's palace.

1895
02:27:42,466 --> 02:27:44,906
But he was not ready
to see you wandering...

1896
02:27:45,003 --> 02:27:47,723
...here and there with a
banished person like him.

1897
02:27:48,748 --> 02:27:54,828
Saxena! - Yes, he had come to
know that Saxena wants to marry you.

1898
02:27:55,043 --> 02:27:57,403
And what about the money
which he took in front of me?

1899
02:27:57,674 --> 02:27:59,994
He distributed it.
He distributed everything...

1900
02:28:00,091 --> 02:28:01,891
...between his unemployed friends.

1901
02:28:02,411 --> 02:28:04,251
I can't change
whatever had happened.

1902
02:28:04,873 --> 02:28:08,442
But I can try to stop the
wrong which is going to happen.

1903
02:28:09,296 --> 02:28:11,936
Mohini, when Lotia kidnapped you...

1904
02:28:12,034 --> 02:28:15,034
...there was only one man
in this city to release you.

1905
02:28:15,537 --> 02:28:16,737
It was Munna.

1906
02:28:17,626 --> 02:28:22,786
He is leaving this city
permanently to live an anonymous life.

1907
02:28:23,309 --> 02:28:27,069
And now there is only one hand
in this city to be with him.

1908
02:28:27,917 --> 02:28:28,717
And it is yours.

1909
02:28:30,919 --> 02:28:33,639
The only aim of my life is to
bring both these hands together.

1910
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:37,400
And if required then
the aim of my death too.

1911
02:28:45,414 --> 02:28:47,590
Go Mohini, go.

1912
02:28:47,888 --> 02:28:50,888
Wait Mohini, you won't
go anywhere. Go inside.

1913
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:55,000
Shyamlal, she won't stop now.
- Get aside you thief.

1914
02:28:58,768 --> 02:29:03,328
My body is not very strong Shyamlal.

1915
02:29:04,500 --> 02:29:10,300
But I have made my soul
strong by living in jail.

1916
02:29:11,372 --> 02:29:16,011
And sometimes the soul
is stronger than a body.

1917
02:29:16,531 --> 02:29:17,851
Go Mohini, go.

1918
02:29:20,995 --> 02:29:22,635
Where are you going?

1919
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:27,810
Go Mohini go, no one
will stop you today.

1920
02:30:28,791 --> 02:30:32,631
Hey Baban, look the
customer is coming, turn it here...

1921
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:35,500
Baban it is your old customer.

1922
02:30:35,623 --> 02:30:41,263
Hey Marwadi, don't leave
your vehicle, catch it properly.

1923
02:30:41,389 --> 02:30:45,349
Run away from here or else
he will sell away my vehicle.

1924
02:30:50,404 --> 02:30:53,164
Hey boys, don't look at my face,
get on with your work.

1925
02:30:53,253 --> 02:30:54,653
Lots of work is pending.

1926
02:30:54,707 --> 02:30:57,187
Take it... - Where is the
screw which I had kept here?

1927
02:30:57,223 --> 02:30:59,863
Nut bolt... - Take it from
here and place it over there.

1928
02:30:59,986 --> 02:31:03,047
Baban brother... A great
wonder happened. - What happened?

1929
02:31:03,126 --> 02:31:05,806
Lotia Pathan is back and he
is hiding in the dockyard.

1930
02:31:05,843 --> 02:31:08,083
And he was saying that he
will kill Munna brother.

1931
02:31:08,862 --> 02:31:13,182
Before killing Munna,
he will have to kill me.

1932
02:31:16,874 --> 02:31:19,554
Munna brother you.
- Hey Chandi, where is Baban?

1933
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:22,100
Lotia Pathan is hiding in
the dockyard to kill you.

1934
02:31:22,284 --> 02:31:23,804
Baban has gone to
compromise with him.

1935
02:31:36,822 --> 02:31:39,382
I had to take
revenge with you too Baban.

1936
02:31:39,782 --> 02:31:41,622
It's good that you
came here yourself.

1937
02:31:41,797 --> 02:31:44,837
To stop you from reaching Munna...

1938
02:31:44,935 --> 02:31:49,455
...this Baban can
reach anywhere, Lotia.

1939
02:31:49,573 --> 02:31:50,973
Don't spare those scoundrels.

1940
02:32:31,089 --> 02:32:35,649
Wait, I have to take
my revenge with him.

1941
02:33:31,308 --> 02:33:35,068
Lotia, you are finished now.
- No Baban, no...

1942
02:33:35,135 --> 02:33:40,855
Leave me... I won't leave him,
I will kill him...

1943
02:33:40,905 --> 02:33:44,385
No Baban... he has enmity
with me, leave that knife...

1944
02:33:44,491 --> 02:33:46,251
Munna, your life has
just started now...

1945
02:33:46,305 --> 02:33:47,865
...you go away from here.

1946
02:33:47,954 --> 02:33:50,914
Baban, your life too
is waiting for you.

1947
02:34:07,922 --> 02:34:09,682
Munna!

1948
02:34:11,217 --> 02:34:14,537
Baban! Baban!

1949
02:34:15,083 --> 02:34:18,643
Baban! Baban!

1950
02:34:18,732 --> 02:34:22,372
Baban! Baban!

1951
02:34:22,452 --> 02:34:25,772
No Baban no...
- Munna, I had told you...

1952
02:34:25,869 --> 02:34:28,549
No Baban no...

1953
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:32,660
No Baban no...
- Munna.

1954
02:34:53,123 --> 02:34:55,843
Lotia!

1955
02:34:58,032 --> 02:35:00,392
Lotia!

1956
02:35:12,677 --> 02:35:13,917
Lotia!

1957
02:35:16,163 --> 02:35:18,283
Learn to bow before the law.

1958
02:35:18,469 --> 02:35:20,409
Inspector, you are
showing me an act of bravery...

1959
02:35:20,514 --> 02:35:22,034
...by disarming me.

1960
02:35:22,530 --> 02:35:25,110
If you dare then keep
aside that pistol then...

1961
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:29,200
...I will show you that how a
law can bend Lotia Pathan.

1962
02:35:30,554 --> 02:35:33,886
To bend a traitor like
you in front of the law...

1963
02:35:34,003 --> 02:35:37,563
...one doesn't need an
uniform or this pistol.

1964
02:35:38,216 --> 02:35:42,096
The youth of this country is
more than a match for you.

1965
02:35:46,366 --> 02:35:47,606
Mahesh.

1966
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:27,280
I know that I allowed
you take law in your hands.

1967
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:30,580
It is a crime but still I did it.

1968
02:37:31,571 --> 02:37:35,131
Because I felt that
this is the only way...

1969
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:37,010
...to bring out the
acid present inside you.

1970
02:37:37,055 --> 02:37:38,575
Now my aim has been completed.

1971
02:37:38,690 --> 02:37:40,290
I am ready to bear any punishment...

1972
02:37:40,482 --> 02:37:42,042
...that law is going to give me.

1973
02:37:50,843 --> 02:37:54,763
-

1974
02:38:04,308 --> 02:38:08,108
"One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten...

1975
02:38:08,195 --> 02:38:11,395
...eleven, twelve and thirteen."

1976
02:38:11,595 --> 02:38:17,035
"I was... I was counting
