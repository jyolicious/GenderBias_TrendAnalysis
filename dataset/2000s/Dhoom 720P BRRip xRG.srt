Some malfunction

Find a computer expert.
Check out the signal

61
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,400
May have been tampered
by someone in that gang

62
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,942
Not tough. Little chip.

63
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,817
Anyone can reset timings

And you'll make out thieves?

68
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:19,275
Who are the guys
who'd use bikes like those?

Why won't ladies give me looks?

82
00:14:56,233 --> 00:15:00,525
They're just sisters
cheering their loser brothers

83
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,983
Rotten bad luck.
God gives everything

84
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:06,942

115
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,983
Not for charity

116
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,733

Who do you think you are?

126
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:53,108
One lifetime in jail...

127
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,983
then you might improve

128
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:55,692

What'd you do after it got hurt?

133

God! Will you ever change?

197
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,317
You're always suspecting everyone

198

00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:46,858
Quick on bikes

203
00:22:49,108 --> 00:22:51,150

You never told him...?

Yaks crap

Then you're also a biker?

224
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:15,692
Biker? He makes a bike fly.

225
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,775
No touchdowns, Ali's bikes fly

226
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:21,067
He just won a race.

227
00:24:21,358 --> 00:24:22,358
On that bike...

228
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:24,650
2 km lead... left the rest clutching

229
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:33,317

Want a bike?

236
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:05,317
Why not?

237
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:09,108
But l want a new bike. Fast

238
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,442
Fast, like this

239
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,483
New, but... no papers
Will do?

240
00:25:16,817 --> 00:25:17,817
No papers? Means?

241
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:19,775
You want to ride a bike or papers?

242
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:21,275
Takes two minutes to make paper

243
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:25,442
But where's the bike?

244
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,817
Right here. You'll find anything

245
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:29,525
Hi Rafik, all fine?

246
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:32,233
lf you're new in Mumbai
you won't know.

247
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:33,983
Here's Flea Market

248
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:36,067
Only name more famous than mine

249

Out of my way

250
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,358
Stay here. Be quiet.
- Why?

251
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,650
Around here everyone's a
loose cannon

252
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:59,400
Speak no evil, hear no evil.
- And you?

253
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:03,358
l got source codes, my settings

254
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,275
No one's afraid of the police?

255
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:14,692
Bloody copper who walks in here
leaves his neck behind

256
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,067
Afraid? Worry not.

257
00:26:19,358 --> 00:26:21,233
So long as you're staring
at only dirt...

258
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:23,733
nothing happens to you.
l'll be back

259
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:45,775
Sharp?

260
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,942
Or blind?

261
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,442
Who are you eyeballing?

262
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,067
Eyes down... Down

263
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:56,358
ln dirt Don't...turn me on

264
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,192
One flick Lands you over there

265
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,400

266
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:04,275

He's mad !

269
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,650
Doesn't know who he's taking on

l'll save him after the first few
Stay right here

271
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:52,025
Want to take on Mad Anwar?

272
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,567
lf you're not a bastard son.
you'll wait.

273

Run

276
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:23,525
Run

277
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:06,025
You're in Shetty's gang?
- Who...?

278
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:08,817
Or Manchekar? Rodrick's? Billu?

279
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:12,733
Which gang do you work for?
- Copper gang

280
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:17,442
Cop... you? Shrunk him in one swipe

281
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,733
... no such spunk in cops

282
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:23,150
Ever faced off cops?

283
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:26,608
Spent my life making ass of cops

284
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,358
Whatever you want to make,
never make a cop

285
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,650
One quirk. How you got this
interest in bikes?

286
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:39,317
Come clean, yes?
Any idea on bank-loot?

287
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,608
No! Too scared of the police

288
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,983
Cops? Can never catch up.

289
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:47,900
Never fear so long as
Ali rides even a bicycle

290
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:51,317
ls it! Some faith in yourself

291
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:56,108
l trust a cop not to catch a thief
when he knows a thief.

292
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:00,275
Stupid

293
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:06,233
These policemen are so stupid...
so damn stupid

294
00:31:06,442 --> 00:31:09,025
Go right in
- They're fun.

295
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:12,858
Once l conned this one
... shined him bright

296
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,317
That was one solid wallop,

297
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:17,358
l'll give you that

298
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:18,400
Pull over

299
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:27,150
What's this joint?

300
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:29,608
My office

301
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,025
You're police?

302
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,525
No. Hitter

303
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,983
Scribble
- What?

304
00:31:54,775 --> 00:31:55,942
How long you've been stealing,

305
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,358
dens, hideaways, accomplices, etc.,
come on

306
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:02,817
Right from start
l had doubts about you.

307
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:06,192
l save you and you give me
a back-kick?

308
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,692
We're both short of time

309
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,942
Admit your guilt

310
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,400
l'll try a plea bargain

311
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,942
Hey sahib...wrong rhyme.
l'm no thief

312
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:22,650
Look, l'm being even with you.

313
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,317
Just tell me what you're planning

314
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:27,067
Who are the others in your gang?

315
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:29,817
Only Chhotu, Munna and Vinod

316
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:32,275
Vinod is green,
can't even ride a bike,

317
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,233
how can l pull off a heist?

318
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:36,608
Look you can't harass me
Not like this...

319
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:38,358
why is he taking off his specs?

320
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:41,483
Stop him, no illegal act

321
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:43,067
Stop chatting the phone.
- Ali...

322
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:49,483
Look l'm losing my mind Your plans
Next robbery. When?

323
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:51,025
No idea, sahib

324
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:56,233
Next heist
- Happened

325
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,150
Next robbery...
- Just happened

326
00:32:58,358 --> 00:32:59,025
What?

327
00:32:59,775 --> 00:33:02,150
A robbery. A while ago. ln Andheri

328
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:10,733
Taking the highway

329
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:40,067
Welcome to Pizza Place

330
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:41,733
What will you have?

331
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:47,942
Good evening sir

332
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:59,858
Any leads Jai? Any clues?

333
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:07,400
Camera locations, police positions,

334
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,150
our reaction times,
they knew everything

335
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:12,108
They left no clues

336
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:14,025
They're professionals

337
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,067
Jai, what's happening?
This is too much

338
00:36:19,983 --> 00:36:23,567
Getting away with daylight robbery

339
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,942
... it's a slur on us

340
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,442
Sir, l think we're going wrong.
- How?

341
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,442
All along we were thinking
like policemen.

342
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:39,650
Now...we got to think like thieves.

343
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:44,733
lf they're sharp,
we got to get sharper

344
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
They use bikes for getaways

345
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:53,733
We use bikes to get them
But our riders are on it.

346
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:55,275
Not our men

347
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,983
Someone else.
- Who?

348
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,858
Jai hit you?
- Who else?

349
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:11,275
And l tell you this,
please don't mind.

350
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:13,108
For what law-abiding
policeman he is...

351
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:14,483
he's really a hood

352
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:17,608
Such a terrible grinding.
- Don't be afraid

353
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:19,692
l'll give him a hollering.
Let him come

354
00:37:19,942 --> 00:37:20,567
l'm not staying on.

355
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,317
He'll put me through the grind again

356
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:24,567
lf he lets go, l lose face value.
l'm quitting

357
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,900
My home is no jailhouse.

358
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,650
He'll face me if he touches you

359
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:33,150
Meanwhile, carrot souffle. Excuse me

360
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,567
l knew l'd find you here

361
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,608
Just returning the box. Bye.

362
00:37:41,817 --> 00:37:43,525
Come. Where're you going?

363
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:44,650
Carrot souffle before you leave?

364
00:37:45,983 --> 00:37:46,942
What's coming over you?

365
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,817
Not another con?

366
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:51,692
Who is it?

367
00:37:53,483 --> 00:37:57,067
Shall l tell Sweety that you
fence stolen bikes?

368
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:02,442
She despises thieves.

369
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:07,442
lf she knows, no more carrot,
only stick

370
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,692
No entry for you in here
- Who's there?

371
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:12,775
Jai...

372
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:15,858
big brother

373
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,650
Jai, what's this l hear?
You hit Ali?

374
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:23,317
l... can l hit anybody?

375
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:29,108
l hit you?
- No

376
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:32,025
l fell off the bike

377
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:35,858
Why would l hit this poor guy?

378
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,442
He didn't get what l was getting at

379
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,567
l took him to the police station
because he's working for me

380
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:45,233
Yes, l was telling him
how he can help us

381
00:38:45,442 --> 00:38:46,608
For that l took him to the
police station

382
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,858
But poor guy got me all wrong

383
00:38:50,983 --> 00:38:52,358
How wonderful Ali,

384
00:38:52,567 --> 00:38:53,900
you're scared for nothing

385
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:56,150
Great Jai

386
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:59,275
See Ali? Jai isn't all that ugly

387
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:01,025
he'll take good care of you

388
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,442
Darling, let's go inside

389
00:39:06,275 --> 00:39:07,275
Good care of me....

390
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:13,358
sums all my fears
Working for you? Doing what?

391
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:14,567
l'm doing nothing

392
00:39:15,317 --> 00:39:16,858
You guys work life's dangers.

393
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,067
l'm not into it

394
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,192
For you

395
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,525
Sweety gets to see it; then others

396
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:34,900
Getting at what, big brother?
For a minimum of 3 years...

397
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,400
your boys get to manage your garage.

398
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:41,358
Why are you after me?

399
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:45,525
Don't peel the specs.
You're fine how you are

400
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:48,983
Tomorrow you're on the job, correct?

401
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,483
6 am sharp

402
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:53,692
Six am...?

403
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:55,775
Morning prayers?

404
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:57,858
l'll give you a rosary.

405
00:39:58,067 --> 00:40:00,650
And l'll take off my specs, go

406
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:02,733
Photo...?
- Glasses?

407
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,983
Say bye to Sweety.
- Out

408
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:16,275
There he is!

409
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,108
So that's your surprise?

410
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:22,692
Grand car, no?

411
00:40:23,442 --> 00:40:28,983
Get in and you're getting looks.
- Not him, the car

412
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:34,858
Price? Never mind.
Only takes... a couple of jobs

413
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:46,150
Yes Kabir? Nice?

414
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:11,900
3000 cc Zero to hundred
ln ten seconds

415
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:19,692
You should buy a car... like this

416
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:23,525
Careful

417
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,775
Good brakes too
Stops in 5 seconds

418
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,192
This is scary

419
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:47,358
Jump
- What?

420
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:49,775
Jump

421
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,525
What have you done?

422
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:14,608
Are you mad?

423
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:16,192
Brand new car

424
00:42:17,275 --> 00:42:18,442
You're very lucky Rahul.

425
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,275
You could've been in that car
- What?

426
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:26,275
lt's no waiter's car

427
00:42:28,233 --> 00:42:31,983
We bandits got to vanish like smoke

428
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:37,400
The day cops get wind, it's all over

429
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:41,025
No one bends my rules

430
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:44,358
Not even l

431
00:42:56,525 --> 00:42:57,192
Colour

432
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,733
Oh Daddy l got a trio

433
00:43:02,442 --> 00:43:03,108
Thank you Mummy

434
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:05,192
l got some luck, no?

435
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:06,942
One more, one more

436
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,692
We're raising stakes now.

437
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,400
Per head... 500

438
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:11,650
Quick

439
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,567
lf hotshot Robin Hood finds out

440
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:19,442
he'll grill me. He puts me off

441
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,317
Tenner?

442
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:29,358
Big brother
- For Band Aid

443
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,233
Next heist is here. This area

444
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,692
How can you be so sure Jai?

445
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:39,942
There's a pattern

446
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:43,067
November 20, Borivali
November 26, Kandivali

447
00:43:43,483 --> 00:43:45,692
November 30, Malad
December 5, Andheri

448
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,775
December 8, Vile Parle

449
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:50,192
ln each of the five heists

450
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,692
the robbers and their bikes
vanished without a trace

451
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:56,275
All in a trice. But how?

452
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:58,900
Five incidents... one common factor

453
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,900
Western Express Highway

454
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:05,858
Always...

455
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:09,150
within a 2 or 3 minute drive
from the highway.

456
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,025
So l think, the next target... is here

457
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:16,275
Any intelligence?

458
00:44:16,483 --> 00:44:19,400
On identities or
allegiances to gangs?

459
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:20,983
This gang works for themselves.

460
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,067
No past record or history

461
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:27,733
ln this city... they can be
anyone, anywhere

462
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,817
They can only be caught in the act.

463
00:44:30,025 --> 00:44:31,900
Because after the hits...

464
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:34,692
how they masquerade
we shall never know

465
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,108
How to know when next?

466
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:38,858
Soon enough, sir.

467
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,483
Five hits in 20 days

468
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:46,692
They're rewing up for a finale
before they go extinct

469
00:44:47,067 --> 00:44:48,067
l think that's their plan

470
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:52,400
But this time,
we'll be staking it out

471
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,775
Shekhar come in

472
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:19,192
Shekhar here sir

473
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,483
Shekhar, cover my position. Copy?

474
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:24,067
Copy that sir

475
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:41,233
You're here, l know it
Show yourself once

476
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,942
Flower wallah Make me a nice
bouquet for 10 bucks.

477
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,067
A whole bouquet for a tenner?

478
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:29,567
Okay, for whom? - Now you're asking
For my wife to-be.

479
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:31,317
l got to be a family wallah

480
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:34,608
No joking on duty. lf the boss gets
to see, we'll have a problem

481
00:46:34,817 --> 00:46:36,358
Who's scared of your boss?

482
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:38,067
Mind your business. Sell me a bouquet

483
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:42,400
Make do with this rose.
- One rose for 10?

484
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:47,108
Just...

485
00:46:48,025 --> 00:46:51,817
Shekhar, you take a break.

486
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:53,567
Get back at six tomorrow
- Okay sir

487
00:46:58,608 --> 00:46:59,650
Me too

488
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:09,525
Home. Sweety has cooked chicken

489
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:16,775
Until we've caught them
you aren't going anywhere, got it?

490
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:19,942
We stay rooted even if
they don't turn up for a week?

491
00:47:20,192 --> 00:47:22,067
You are too busy?

492
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:24,150
Want to inaugurate a jail?

493
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:26,400
But Sweety's chicken...

494
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:30,900
Never heard of contact lenses?

495
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:37,358
l'll eat on time

496
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,067
Okay. Bye

497
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:45,317
Sweety, l'm working

498
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,108
Okay

00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,775
Yes l love you too. Bye

500
00:47:58,567 --> 00:47:59,608
What?

501
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:04,108
Go on

502
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:08,608
First, promise
- What?

503
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:12,442
Not to hit me
- No

504
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:19,900
What no? You won't hit me
or you won't promise me?

505
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,358
Can't promise l won't hit you

506
00:48:24,817 --> 00:48:26,192
Then l'm not telling

507
00:48:33,525 --> 00:48:34,358
Okay, you can tell me

508
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:43,192
You ought to know,
Sweety would've married me, - What?

509
00:48:44,983 --> 00:48:47,733
That's if l had met her before
... but it's okay

510
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:51,025
She was more ravishing then or now?

511
00:48:53,317 --> 00:48:55,192
You want a bashing now or later?

512
00:48:56,608 --> 00:48:58,483
Must've been arranged marriage

513
00:48:59,775 --> 00:49:03,900
lt was arranged for you, yes? Admit it

514
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,650
Hello sweety

515
00:49:08,108 --> 00:49:10,150
There's an envelope on the table

516
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:14,650
My photos inside it?
No please, Sweety mustn't see

517
00:49:14,858 --> 00:49:17,275
lt's there?

518
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:21,275
Big brother... My reputation

519
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:24,567
She won't see my face
- Who?

520
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:27,858
Sweety... your wife
What else?

521
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,817

00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,025
Don't cry for me, Mummy.

524
00:49:49,442 --> 00:49:54,442
His heart has turned to stone
- Will you shut up?

525
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:52,150
Sit tight
- What?

526
00:50:52,817 --> 00:50:59,983
l mean... public Public distress.
And sleeping police?

527
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:01,525
This is catastrophe

528
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:04,150
Public help! lt's a police slogan.

529
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:06,400
You're making her helpless

530
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,525
Some guy, by God

531
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,483
Okay you sit tight.
Let me help

532
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,275

533
00:51:15,817 --> 00:51:17,858
Starting up stalled cars
... is religion

534
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:18,900
Excuse me

535
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,858

547
00:53:52,108 --> 00:53:55,483
My home's lovely; my heart's lonely

548
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:58,608
My dreams... so far they seem...

549
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:02,442
in a life, without wife

550
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:04,692
You're lonely

00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:10,067
You're lively, So hopefully...

553
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:56,858
But your lies are lovely

554
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:07,275
You're silly

555
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,900
But you pack your lies lovely

556
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:18,233
Still how can l fall for you?
l still don't know you

557
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:24,817
Wait for another day
l'll decide what to say

558
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:25,692
Fast girl

559
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,483
Gone. Back to work

560
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:14,692
Yes sir, hello sir

561
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:17,817
Over here.
- No pranks

562
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,900
You'll do one turn for me.
- Which?

563
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:25,108
l got to find this sweetheart.
- You need addresses, photos

564
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:27,400
Given all that, even l can find her.

565
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,650
You police guys are hopeless, really

566
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:31,358
l warn you

567
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:36,775
Take the left gate.
Post me every 5 minutes

568
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,608
One question, sir

569
00:56:46,025 --> 00:56:48,942
l got to improve my general knowledge

570
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:51,900
and you're what a walking law school

571
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:54,650
Shut up

572
00:56:55,233 --> 00:56:56,400
No, shut up

573
00:56:57,317 --> 00:56:59,358
Keep shut, do the job

574
00:57:04,775 --> 00:57:07,525
Bikes. Coming

575
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,442
Not coming...
moving away from us

576
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:37,108
Go. Get them
Don't let them escape

577
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:45,442
At 260...
l'm doing full throttle

578
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:47,067
He's over 300

579
00:59:59,108 --> 01:00:00,108
Serve table 12

580
01:00:01,192 --> 01:00:02,358
Must do something about him

581
01:00:03,942 --> 01:00:04,608
Not here

582
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:06,858
Rohit is my brother.

583
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,608
He could've died

584
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:10,525
l said, not here.

585
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:14,358
Fetch the order for table 12
- Damn table 12

586
01:00:14,733 --> 01:00:16,442
l'm not sparing that cop

587
01:00:19,775 --> 01:00:21,483
l'll do what's to be done.

588
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:24,067
You don't tax your brains

589
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:31,567
Good evening sir. - Good evening.
Table for 2 please.

590
01:00:37,692 --> 01:00:39,900
Rohit, upstairs

591
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:49,608
Fighting the spurt in crime...
is supercop Jai Dixit

592
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:52,567
You're on TV

593
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,067
You solved your cases
in record time

594
01:00:56,275 --> 01:00:59,192
Except this bike gang
What's taking you so long?

595
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:01,442
You've seen rats stealing?

596
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,442
He grabs a steal...
and runs for his hole.

597
01:01:05,983 --> 01:01:08,233
That's how this bike gang is
...like rats

598
01:01:09,317 --> 01:01:11,692
They wear masks
Then they vanish

599
01:01:12,275 --> 01:01:15,192
We foiled one of their operations

600
01:01:15,733 --> 01:01:19,525
Hopefully... this gang
won't bother us for long

601
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,442
A message for the audience?

602
01:01:21,817 --> 01:01:25,400
You'll see the defeat
on their faces soon

603
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:28,025
For the gang...
what's your message?

604
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,650
Maybe they're watching
TV right now - No madam

605
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:32,192
l don't talk to criminals

606
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:35,275
Thank you sir.
- That was supercop Jai Dixit

607
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,942
For rest of the news,
watch 'Aaj Tak'

608
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,108
l feel... like...
- Be cool

609
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:50,817
Don't bill him. Men like him don't
drop in every day.

610
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:53,733
Take care of him
- Yes boss

611
01:01:55,858 --> 01:01:57,067
Must take care of him

612
01:02:00,233 --> 01:02:01,233
l'll take good care of him

613
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:03,650
Well done Jai

614
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:06,442
So what if we didn't
catch the thieves,

615
01:02:06,983 --> 01:02:08,692
their loot... we retrieved

616
01:02:09,442 --> 01:02:13,025
That bike will tell us
why they're so fast

617
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:14,775
Hold

618
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:16,858
Dr. Ali's operation successful.

619
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,525
Wonderful engineering
Main thing, nitrous oxide cylinder

620
01:02:20,733 --> 01:02:22,067
Know what it does?

621
01:02:22,275 --> 01:02:25,025
Flick of a switch...
bike becomes a rocket

622
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,275
Another highlight
Trigger for timer.

623
01:02:27,525 --> 01:02:29,900
what's more...
- Good, very good

624
01:02:31,692 --> 01:02:37,025
Jai, what's our next step?
- They've taken a beating

625
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:39,442
lt's their turn to make a move

626
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,650
For you

627
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:46,400
Didn't call for hello-hi
- Who?

628
01:02:46,817 --> 01:02:48,858
lf l'm telling it all,
what're you doing?

629
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:51,817
How will you give
grand TV interviews?

630
01:02:52,192 --> 01:02:59,108
Then you heard me.
l don't talk to criminals

631
01:03:01,067 --> 01:03:03,608
See you in jail
- Thanks for the offer

632
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:06,567
But l'm not destined for jail

633
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,358
Got yourself one grand destiny,

634
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:15,608
great brains too; but...
future looks somewhat shady

635
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:16,317
Really?

636
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:19,775
Yes. You took the pains to call me

637
01:03:19,983 --> 01:03:21,858
lt's my duty to keep you warned

638
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:26,025
l like your style

639
01:03:27,483 --> 01:03:30,192
Perhaps you're too confident, no?

640
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,733
Tell me your address.

641
01:03:34,942 --> 01:03:38,192
l'll deliver the bike and the money
Will help your confidence too

642
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,442
Say what you will

643
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,192
you'll never catch me

644
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:45,858
Don't play hero. You're a thief.

645
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,775
You'll run, l'll catch you

646
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:51,400
l'll walk right through you
you won't even recognise me

647
01:03:52,317 --> 01:03:56,108
For once, show up. You won't be
worth recognising anymore

648
01:03:56,483 --> 01:03:58,692
l'll come right up to you.

649
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:02,025
l'll even tell you about my next hit

650
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,775
Where will you find thieves like me?

651
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,275
You find thieves only in jails.

652
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:11,733
l'll see you right there

653
01:04:12,317 --> 01:04:16,442
My next time, my next target
you'll know beforehand

654
01:04:17,858 --> 01:04:20,233
lf you nab me, it's my neck

655
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,608
lf l escape...
- lmpossible

656
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:27,733
l love the impossible Mr. Dixit

657
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:30,150
But one little clause

658
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:34,317
lf you fail...
you'll drop the case

659
01:04:36,442 --> 01:04:40,942
What happened? Afraid?
- Where?

660
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,317
Oh, l'm sorry.
- lt's okay.

661
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:05,900
Where are you headed?

662
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:09,025
Up ahead

663
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:15,108
l'll take you

664
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:17,733
l'll manage. Don't waste your time.

665
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:22,067
Helping is no waste of time. Careful

666
01:06:23,858 --> 01:06:25,733
Very few like you around nowadays

667
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:29,358
Untrue

668
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:32,858
Not exactly the age of good Samaritans

669
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:40,317
No matter how rapid the evil strides

670
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:42,733
the good is always a march ahead

671
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,050
Saying something?
- But how, Kabir?

672
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,633
The police will be there in force;

673
01:08:20,425 --> 01:08:23,008
politicians are coming
lt's a high security zone

674
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:27,008
Getting inside will be tough,
as for pulling it off...

675
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:35,508
We steal

676
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
Right in front of everyone

677
01:08:40,258 --> 01:08:41,758
And we'll make a getaway in public

678
01:08:43,008 --> 01:08:43,508
Trust me

679
01:08:44,925 --> 01:08:47,508
Bullets... can outspeed our bikes

680
01:08:48,217 --> 01:08:51,675
Not in bullets.
Speed is a shooter's spunk

681
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:32,642
Rock

682
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,308
Love Want it?

683
01:09:36,517 --> 01:09:38,725
Make. Love Do or die

684
01:09:38,933 --> 01:09:41,350
Love ls liveliest

685
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:45,850
Love. Just do it

686
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,308
Love. To do or die for

687
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,892
Love. Never comes again

688
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:55,767
Love... is life

689
01:09:55,975 --> 01:10:02,725
Love is... joy. Give in to love...
and swing

690
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:05,100
Pump the rock

691
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,183
Rock

692
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:57,308
What's in love?

693
01:10:58,183 --> 01:11:01,975
Ask someone. Who's wild

694
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:04,600
Sways you? Why?

695
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:06,850
Makes a smile? Why?

696
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:12,058
Ask fireflies Why

697
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,142
Love's life is short

698
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,558
Begin with a flirt...

699
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:41,600
Then give in to the spell
kiss... and

700
01:11:41,808 --> 01:11:43,892
Pump the rock

701
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,725
Rock

702
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:45,225
Lonesome lives go unlived

703
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,892
Every soul here knows

704
01:12:50,475 --> 01:12:54,933
Dear stranger, you don't know
What desires you stir in my core

705
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:59,642
For one lively sin...
l'll ask you for more

706
01:13:19,808 --> 01:13:22,017
Make every loving moment rock

707
01:13:22,267 --> 01:13:29,475
Love's rhythm makes your heart rock
Up love's blind alley... come...

708
01:13:29,558 --> 01:13:46,892
pump the rock...

709
01:13:53,558 --> 01:13:56,767
Over? No, won't do.
l've only arrived

710
01:13:58,058 --> 01:13:59,225
Guys... what's the vote?

711
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:01,975
Once more - Once more

712
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:20,017
Ladies & gentlemen

713
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:25,100
The proceeds from this show goes to the
Chief Minister's Relief Fund

714
01:15:25,642 --> 01:15:29,767
The amount is... 42,50,000.
Have a look

715
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:39,683
The money...?
- Where is it?

716
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,642
Sweetheart... Ambulance

717
01:18:28,808 --> 01:18:30,517
What happened sir?

718
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:35,892
l saw them in Pizza Place. 
They were waiters.

719
01:18:38,558 --> 01:18:40,100
Are we going there?

720
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:44,767
No use. We won't find anyone there

721
01:18:47,433 --> 01:18:49,975
How much did you sell out for?

722
01:18:50,183 --> 01:18:51,725
This sweetheart... she swooned

723
01:18:51,933 --> 01:18:55,017
How much money?
- Not my fault

724
01:18:56,267 --> 01:18:57,767
l tell you...

725
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:03,350
No discounts on courtesy

726
01:19:05,683 --> 01:19:07,892
Brother, if l let go

727
01:19:08,433 --> 01:19:09,600
you'll get a changed face

728
01:19:18,517 --> 01:19:21,267
On the bike lt's your job

729
01:19:21,808 --> 01:19:23,017
Not the girl

730
01:19:35,392 --> 01:19:37,267
Once again...
the mysterious bike gang

731
01:19:37,475 --> 01:19:40,225
has struck... sending the
city into a tizzy.

732
01:19:40,433 --> 01:19:44,558
Sources indicate that... the police were
tipped off... well in advance

733
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:47,350
As usual they could achieve nothing

734
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:50,808
Jai Dixit, despite all your efforts...

735
01:19:51,017 --> 01:19:53,058
the bike gang got away with it?

736
01:19:53,642 --> 01:19:54,808
Not because they're exceptional.

737
01:19:55,017 --> 01:19:55,850
The mistake was mine

738
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:57,600
l made a very big mistake

739
01:19:58,142 --> 01:19:59,517
Therefore on moral grounds

740
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,100
l am dropping this case
And l'm resigning

741
01:20:02,308 --> 01:20:04,725
And that mechanic?
- He's no longer on the team

742
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:08,475
Clarify l think you know
Excuse me

743
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:12,725
That's Jai Dixit

744
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:16,933
Rahul

745
01:20:19,392 --> 01:20:20,517
Where are you going?

746
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:26,767
Not a cop any longer,
so no sparing him

747
01:20:27,017 --> 01:20:30,975
Foolish. Killing him
won't bring back Rohit

748
01:20:31,683 --> 01:20:34,933
We've lots more to do.
Get on the job

749
01:20:38,975 --> 01:20:40,142
Who does Rohit's job?

750
01:20:41,267 --> 01:20:43,100
Without him, the next job
isn't getting done

751
01:20:48,892 --> 01:20:50,433
Get ready to quit this city.

752
01:20:52,183 --> 01:20:53,350
l'll take care of loose ends

753
01:21:04,517 --> 01:21:07,267
What's wrong with Ali Bhai?
- Very early lead

754
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:24,142
Too late... the race is on.
What are you racing for?

755
01:21:48,517 --> 01:21:49,350
Who's that?

756
01:21:51,808 --> 01:21:52,808
He's fast

757
01:23:04,975 --> 01:23:05,975
Sorry guys

758
01:23:06,517 --> 01:23:08,225
Never mind, happens.

759
01:23:08,433 --> 01:23:10,142
We've made loads out of you

760
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:13,267
One race makes no difference.
- Still, you lost money

761
01:23:13,642 --> 01:23:15,350
Luckless day

762
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,475
Scrapped with Jai; then Sweetheart
vanishes from the hospital

763
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:21,975
Made me want to burn the track.
Here, l'm run out

764
01:23:22,183 --> 01:23:24,058
l really want to wreck
that guy in black

765
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:30,975
What man?

766
01:23:32,058 --> 01:23:37,100
l don't take charity
- l'm not racing for money

767
01:23:39,183 --> 01:23:41,433
What l'm looking for money won't buy

768
01:23:47,683 --> 01:23:49,392
Am l game? No way

769
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,808
l don't fancy getting
shot by the police

770
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:54,683
The police can't even touch you

771
01:23:55,558 --> 01:23:59,350
and you know it.
Or are you scared?

772
01:24:00,725 --> 01:24:05,183
lf l could, l would drown
every cop in the sea...

773
01:24:05,517 --> 01:24:06,600
beginning with Jai;

774
01:24:06,892 --> 01:24:09,100
after pumping him so hard

775
01:24:11,475 --> 01:24:13,017
Harder than l care to tell you

776
01:24:14,975 --> 01:24:15,975
Then why hesitate?

777
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:22,392
How to find confidence in you?

778
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,808
You can be a cop

779
01:24:35,933 --> 01:24:37,850
Not a copper has set sight
on this face.

780
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:40,475
Never will you might not think so

781
01:24:42,725 --> 01:24:46,392
but l know you're worth millions

782
01:24:48,267 --> 01:24:49,600
Don't waste your life, Ali

783
01:24:52,142 --> 01:24:54,808
lf l tell the cops that
l've seen you

784
01:24:55,933 --> 01:24:57,767
l'm up for the reward

785
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:03,017
l think you already got a reward
for working with the police

786
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,975
l'm sure you aren't going
anywhere near them

787
01:25:07,808 --> 01:25:09,267
6 am tomorrow, Khopoli.

788
01:25:09,475 --> 01:25:11,183
At the crossroads

789
01:25:11,975 --> 01:25:13,058
See you

790
01:25:15,725 --> 01:25:17,767
l'm not an early riser

791
01:25:17,975 --> 01:25:22,267
Your luck is changing
You'll change

792
01:26:04,892 --> 01:26:09,392
Mummy was always telling me Ali,
you're smart and you're fast

793
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:12,350
You want to be smart and fast?
- Sure

794
01:26:12,558 --> 01:26:13,017
Just open up

795
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:16,517
Now close it

796
01:26:17,225 --> 01:26:18,058
Tony Bhai

797
01:26:19,142 --> 01:26:20,683
Ali, something's odd about my bike.

798
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:21,725
What?
- The firing.

799
01:26:22,267 --> 01:26:24,683
l'll change my name
if l can't fix it

800
01:26:25,392 --> 01:26:33,183
What will you name yourself? Rohit?
- Mummy gave me a great name

801
01:26:33,392 --> 01:26:36,308
So why change it. Sorry Tony,
no changing names. Rahul is right

802
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,808
Rahul Bhai, you can tell me
whenever your bike sneezes

803
01:26:40,017 --> 01:26:40,850
Don't touch it

804
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:45,017
You'll take Rohit's place?
He's dead. Because of you.

805
01:26:45,225 --> 01:26:46,933
l'm on your side now, brother

806
01:26:47,142 --> 01:26:47,767
l'm no brother

807
01:26:49,058 --> 01:26:51,767
l fly off my handle,
you end up a sissy

808
01:26:52,183 --> 01:26:53,017
You bloody

809
01:26:53,225 --> 01:26:53,683
Boys

810
01:26:55,475 --> 01:26:56,308
Take it easy

811
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:02,225
l don't like his face

812
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,558
And l don't like your face
Nor you like mine

813
01:27:07,975 --> 01:27:12,975
We're not friends
But we need each other

814
01:27:13,558 --> 01:27:14,558
That's it

815
01:27:16,683 --> 01:27:18,392
After we're done this time,

816
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:21,517
no one will have any need left

817
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,350
Neither to steal nor
to tolerate each other

818
01:27:28,558 --> 01:27:30,725
So stop the infighting

819
01:27:33,183 --> 01:27:37,475
l want all six of us
over here at sunset

820
01:27:38,225 --> 01:27:39,558
Let's get down to some serious work

821
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,433
Kabir Bhai, listen...

822
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:52,892
you're a great guy.
But one little mistake

823
01:27:53,517 --> 01:27:57,225
We're five of us, not six.
Mannu, Tony, myself

824
01:27:57,808 --> 01:28:02,100
Mr Boom-bastic and you. Five.
- Not five. Six

825
01:28:02,892 --> 01:28:05,225
Start counting
Mannu, Tony, myself...

826
01:28:05,433 --> 01:28:06,475
Look

827
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:15,767
Thank you, Mummy

828
01:29:21,392 --> 01:29:24,308
Topclass acting.

829
01:29:24,683 --> 01:29:27,767
Dance, romance, works
l sent you on an ambulance ride

830
01:29:27,975 --> 01:29:30,725
And l find you riding waves

831
01:29:30,933 --> 01:29:31,600
Wonderful sweetheart

832
01:29:35,767 --> 01:29:36,600
My name is Sheena

833
01:29:37,392 --> 01:29:41,142
And whatever l did with you
was part of my job

834
01:29:42,225 --> 01:29:45,350
My job. So you and me...

835
01:29:46,475 --> 01:29:47,433
Never think of it

836
01:29:52,392 --> 01:29:53,683
What Mummy...

837
01:29:53,892 --> 01:29:55,392
you send me one girl
and she's a hood

838
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:59,392
Too many hassles in life

839
01:30:00,642 --> 01:30:04,100
Taj Exotica. Largest,
grandest hotel in Goa

840
01:30:05,683 --> 01:30:07,392
Yes lovely hotel

841
01:30:08,642 --> 01:30:11,058
But we're thieves, not tourists

842
01:30:12,808 --> 01:30:14,017
What the hell are we doing here?

843
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:20,933
Look at it through a thiefs eyes...

844
01:30:22,892 --> 01:30:25,475
and you'll see 180 million bucks

845
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,767
lndia's biggest casino

846
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,558
Fortunes are made
everyday and... lost

847
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:44,933
Whatever a gambler's luck...

848
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:47,600
the casino is always...
on a winning spree

849
01:30:51,225 --> 01:30:55,183
Last year, December 31 ...
raked in... 16 crores

850
01:30:55,767 --> 01:30:57,642
Takings Trucked away

851
01:30:57,850 --> 01:31:03,517
To a special vault once every
hour under tight security

852
01:31:04,767 --> 01:31:06,808
They are so confident
about the security system

853
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,225
No video cameras are installed

854
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:16,433
This year on December 31
the management expects...

855
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,142
the casino will rake in
180 million, minimum

856
01:31:29,808 --> 01:31:30,808
180 million

857
01:31:33,308 --> 01:31:34,475
Six thieves

858
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:37,933
Split evenly

859
01:31:38,142 --> 01:31:40,183
How much for the two of us
put together, sweetheart?

860
01:31:41,225 --> 01:31:43,683
l'm bad at arithmetic

861
01:31:46,308 --> 01:31:50,975
lt's our final hit
Afterwards, we're free

862
01:31:52,350 --> 01:31:54,433
We will never see one another again

863
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,725
nor will we try to contact each other

864
01:31:58,475 --> 01:32:02,433
Nice idea. But it's a hotel, not a bank.

865
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,183
Teeming with people. So more risk

866
01:32:04,392 --> 01:32:09,558
Mannu says that the security system
was designed by an lsraeli company

867
01:32:10,017 --> 01:32:14,100
Opening the safe won't be easy.
- lnfrared alarm at main door

868
01:32:15,225 --> 01:32:18,433
Goa police will be after
us in 30 seconds

869
01:32:18,808 --> 01:32:21,225
Kabir must've worked all that out

870
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:25,725
What l want to know is
How we go about it.

871
01:32:26,725 --> 01:32:28,517
l'll second that question

872
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:35,808
Whatever we do...
we do in style

873
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:46,058
Four-stroke joint

874
01:32:56,017 --> 01:32:58,600
We got reservations
- Name?

875
01:32:58,808 --> 01:33:02,058
Prince Ali Akbar Fateh Khan
of Secunderabad

876
01:33:02,308 --> 01:33:03,600
Of course

877
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:05,350
Suite 101?

878
01:33:11,892 --> 01:33:13,350
Hi Austin... Austin Powers.

879
01:33:13,558 --> 01:33:14,392
You lodged a complaint?

880
01:33:14,933 --> 01:33:19,058
There's a virus in the system.
- l'm here to fix it

881
01:33:19,308 --> 01:33:19,933
This way, please

882
01:33:26,558 --> 01:33:28,558
We offer a choice of suites

883
01:33:29,267 --> 01:33:34,892
Any reason for your choice?
- We're honeymooning

884
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:39,933
Royal astrologer says, book into room
101 for Baby-Prince-coming-fast

885
01:33:49,225 --> 01:33:51,392
Listen... l want my money back.
- What?

886
01:33:52,142 --> 01:33:54,183
lt's my money.
- lt's Kabir's money

887
01:33:54,767 --> 01:33:57,308
Then give me a loan

888
01:33:57,517 --> 01:34:03,392
Why on earth did Kabir take him on?
- Because he knows you love me secretly

889
01:34:05,183 --> 01:34:08,017
Keep that gibberish here.

890
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:10,683
Downstairs, remember you're a Prince

891
01:34:14,058 --> 01:34:15,725
Exhausted your English vocabulary?

892
01:34:15,933 --> 01:34:17,475
Should've saved some for tonight

893
01:34:17,725 --> 01:34:18,517
Hello Room Service

894
01:34:19,267 --> 01:34:21,642
101 . Room service order.
- Got it

895
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:27,017
Good you're here

896
01:34:27,267 --> 01:34:29,475
Taking charge of the bar?
What's your name?

897
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:42,517
You play like a seasoned gambler.

898
01:34:42,725 --> 01:34:44,767
lf you're so good who needs thieving?

899
01:34:45,308 --> 01:34:47,725
Ali, you're a prince. Don't forget

900
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:50,308
Sweetheart, no yakking.

901
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:51,725
Daddy is eavesdropping

902
01:34:52,975 --> 01:34:55,892
Good evening. Everything okay?
- Yes yes. Thank you. Very okay

903
01:34:56,850 --> 01:35:01,267
One problem. We're leaving tonight.
- At 13 past 12

904
01:35:01,642 --> 01:35:04,225
Have we caused anything?
- No, not yet

905
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:07,892
Royal astrologer called
and Daddy insists. So...

906
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:10,308
got to go.
- We're back next week

907
01:35:10,683 --> 01:35:11,683
Wonderful

908
01:35:12,267 --> 01:35:13,267
Our luggage is packed.

909
01:35:13,475 --> 01:35:15,517
Please have it put in the car
- Don't worry my dear

910
01:35:16,767 --> 01:35:19,183
Your luggage will be in your car
at quarter past twelve

911
01:35:23,725 --> 01:35:25,433
By then we've robbed the place

912
01:35:26,058 --> 01:35:28,892
l told you. Never use the word

913
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:31,683
Who have we to fear?

914
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,933
No cops around

915
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:38,100
One whisky please

916
01:35:48,058 --> 01:35:48,725
What are you drinking?

917
01:35:52,767 --> 01:35:54,100
Forgot

918
01:35:56,767 --> 01:35:59,308
Anything will do
Make it quick

919
01:35:59,517 --> 01:36:02,975
Else, my wife will find out

920
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:13,558
Will you have a drink?
- No thanks

921
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:14,767
l don't drink

922
01:36:15,058 --> 01:36:18,267
What? Really?

923
01:36:20,017 --> 01:36:27,808
You... a bartender
who doesn't drink? How?

924
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:32,308
With... all the booze around

925
01:36:32,558 --> 01:36:34,058
Very bad

926
01:36:34,475 --> 01:36:37,725
All around, money's flying too.
But l never steal

927
01:36:38,808 --> 01:36:43,183
Very good

928
01:36:47,683 --> 01:36:50,933
You know...

929
01:36:52,392 --> 01:36:53,892
Was

930
01:36:56,892 --> 01:36:58,058
Never tell anyone.

931
01:36:59,058 --> 01:37:00,475
They'll run scared

932
01:37:00,725 --> 01:37:06,558
l won't tell anyone that you've had
a drink and you're a police officer

933
01:37:08,017 --> 01:37:12,808
Was
- Okay. Was

934
01:37:16,517 --> 01:37:17,017
Thanks buddy

935
01:37:17,225 --> 01:37:21,683
Happy New Year

936
01:37:22,267 --> 01:37:23,058
Now...?

937
01:37:25,392 --> 01:37:26,725
At midnight, no?

938
01:37:26,933 --> 01:37:28,100
ln case we don't meet

939
01:37:29,017 --> 01:37:30,017
Happy New Year in advance

940
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:39,225
No my friend
Of course we'll meet

941
01:37:40,517 --> 01:37:43,600
ln Happy New Year

942
01:37:46,142 --> 01:37:47,058

My drink

944
01:37:56,350 --> 01:38:00,433
Was... what l was

945
01:38:06,558 --> 01:38:08,267
Jai Dixit is in the hotel

946
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,350
How could this happen?
Now what to do?

947
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,600
l warned you

948
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:19,392
lt's serious Kabir

949
01:38:21,683 --> 01:38:22,350
Where is Ali?

950
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:27,183
Let's get our luggage
- What?

951
01:38:27,433 --> 01:38:31,183
Let's slip out quietly

952
01:38:32,267 --> 01:38:38,475
Kabir Bhai, you start out first.
- Relax Ali

953
01:38:39,225 --> 01:38:44,600
lt's time we ran. No one knows
that psycho more than l know

954
01:38:44,808 --> 01:38:47,017
He'll crunch every bone

955
01:38:47,225 --> 01:38:48,600
Alone, he's no threat to us

956
01:38:50,433 --> 01:38:51,725
Don't underestimate him.

957
01:38:51,933 --> 01:38:53,267
He's the last samurai

958
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:54,642
l don't give a damn

959
01:39:01,142 --> 01:39:07,350
Anyway, it's New Years Eve, the whole
world is here, maybe he's just a guest

960
01:39:08,017 --> 01:39:12,767
So, we change plans?
- No Sheena

961
01:39:16,142 --> 01:39:18,308
l waited a whole year for tonight

962
01:39:20,058 --> 01:39:23,350
My plans. Mine

963
01:39:24,433 --> 01:39:25,267
No change

964
01:39:35,767 --> 01:39:39,683
180 million. And steal
it all by myself

965
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:43,517
Anyone who isn't with me
isn't coming with me

966
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:38,767
Take in this wonderful night

967
01:40:39,142 --> 01:40:42,600
lt's all in this moment
it'll never come one more time

968
01:40:51,142 --> 01:40:54,933
To another night...
to another time...

969
01:40:55,142 --> 01:40:59,100
to a new tomorrow

970
01:40:59,308 --> 01:41:06,933
Cheers

971
01:42:20,975 --> 01:42:28,058
lt's wild tonight...
in drunken delight

972
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:32,767
Earth spins at our feet

973
01:42:32,975 --> 01:42:36,392
We're so full of life

974
01:42:37,142 --> 01:42:44,558
You've only so long as you're
still young only so much fun

975
01:42:45,308 --> 01:42:49,267
Just a little flip

976
01:42:49,475 --> 01:42:52,558
Get a taste of the real thing

977
01:42:53,308 --> 01:42:57,267
To another night,
to another time

978
01:42:57,475 --> 01:42:59,183
To a new tomorrow

979
01:42:59,392 --> 01:43:01,100
Who cares what the world thinks

980
01:44:02,642 --> 01:44:06,267
We're carefree

981
01:44:06,808 --> 01:44:09,892
Who cares where

982
01:44:10,808 --> 01:44:14,600
This trip ends

983
01:44:14,808 --> 01:44:18,058
We're wild and free

984
01:44:18,308 --> 01:44:22,767
We're free, we're different

985
01:44:22,975 --> 01:44:26,767
We can do what we want

986
01:44:26,975 --> 01:44:29,017
Whatever you hear

987
01:44:29,183 --> 01:44:30,725
Whatever they say

988
01:44:31,142 --> 01:44:34,225
Nothing's stopping us today

989
01:44:34,975 --> 01:44:38,767
To another night, to another time

990
01:44:38,975 --> 01:44:42,392
To a new tomorrow

991
01:44:43,017 --> 01:44:45,017
Cheers

992
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:32,267
Been a pleasure having you here

993
01:45:32,475 --> 01:45:33,517
Same here

994
01:45:33,725 --> 01:45:34,558
Everything to satisfaction?

995
01:45:34,767 --> 01:45:36,267
Privacy etc?

996
01:45:36,517 --> 01:45:37,142
Yes

997
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:38,183
Your luggage

998
01:45:45,683 --> 01:45:47,933
Congratulations boys.
We've done it

999
01:46:33,475 --> 01:46:34,517
Like l said

1000
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,933
we meet in the new year

1001
01:46:40,267 --> 01:46:41,267
Happy New Year

1002
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:44,767
Now...?
- Your wish

1003
01:46:45,975 --> 01:46:51,642
You can try running, then chasing,
then blood and gore

1004
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:55,267
Or we can depart peacefully.

1005
01:46:55,892 --> 01:46:59,350
Get in my car, then jail sweet jail

1006
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:01,100
lt's upto you

1007
01:47:04,433 --> 01:47:04,933
Let's walk

1008
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:26,058
You do a good bit of acting.
- And you're good at stealing

1009
01:47:27,183 --> 01:47:30,267
But the good is one
march ahead of evil

1010
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:32,017
You're good

1011
01:47:33,267 --> 01:47:36,725
Were you a thief, we'd be friends

1012
01:47:42,308 --> 01:47:45,225
Kabir you break my heart

1013
01:47:45,767 --> 01:47:48,017
l thought we're friends enough

1014
01:47:48,392 --> 01:47:50,433
for you to write me letters from jail

1015
01:47:52,225 --> 01:47:53,392
Between friends...

1016
01:47:55,142 --> 01:47:56,142
you got me

1017
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:58,267
but what about the loot?

1018
01:47:59,017 --> 01:48:00,350
You don't have the money

1019
01:48:04,558 --> 01:48:05,058
l do

1020
01:48:08,725 --> 01:48:14,767
Right now Ali is
delivering the cash, nice?

1021
01:48:19,642 --> 01:48:23,225
You're wasting your time
with the police

1022
01:48:24,892 --> 01:48:25,392
You're very good

1023
01:48:26,975 --> 01:48:31,808
Ali was with you.
You planted him

1024
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:34,017
Don't blame me.

1025
01:48:35,308 --> 01:48:36,642
You took him on

1026
01:48:40,892 --> 01:48:45,350
That fight was a sham?

1027
01:48:47,142 --> 01:48:51,767
He took real blows.
Sorry if that hurts you

1028
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:05,183
After Rohit, l'd go to Ali looking
for another rider. You knew it?

1029
01:49:05,975 --> 01:49:07,642
No. l hoped

1030
01:49:10,433 --> 01:49:11,433
Mind blowing

1031
01:49:12,142 --> 01:49:14,017
Ali and you

1032
01:49:15,267 --> 01:49:16,308
You got me man

1033
01:49:18,475 --> 01:49:21,850
lt was a perfect plan - Not was

1034
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,517
lt is a perfect plan

1035
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,267
One thing Jai

1036
01:49:31,975 --> 01:49:37,850
Nothing is permanent
Not you, not l

1037
01:49:39,058 --> 01:49:43,392
Neither plan, Nor time

1038
01:49:53,350 --> 01:49:54,350
See?

1039
01:49:54,642 --> 01:49:56,100
Time changes

1040
01:50:00,308 --> 01:50:01,308
What happened to the lights?

1041
01:50:01,517 --> 01:50:02,850
Check the lights

1042
01:50:10,933 --> 01:50:12,433
Run Kabir

1043
01:50:14,392 --> 01:50:15,392
Run for your life

1044
01:50:30,558 --> 01:50:31,892
True sweetheart

1045
01:50:33,683 --> 01:50:35,183
There's lots of money in crime.

1046
01:50:36,433 --> 01:50:37,808
But respectability? Not a shred

1047
01:50:42,892 --> 01:50:46,308
Kabir won't spare you
- Kabir has become mincemeat

1048
01:50:46,517 --> 01:50:50,475
You know Jai?
One danger-full guy

1049
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:56,558
For a 3000 buck job...?
- Please sweetheart

1050
01:50:56,767 --> 01:50:58,308
Not just for the money.

1051
01:50:58,517 --> 01:51:00,058
The starched uniform is a perk

1052
01:51:01,642 --> 01:51:05,100
After being with Jai, l admit.
lt's a respectable job

1053
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:09,600
Once we're mister-missus...
you will...

1054
01:51:09,808 --> 01:51:11,183
say it with pride.
My husband, police

1055
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:15,308
Just say you love me
before you run for it

1056
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,100
l'm not running

1057
01:51:18,308 --> 01:51:23,475
Even if l run
l won't come back to you

1058
01:51:24,767 --> 01:51:29,225
Guarantee! Our marriage certificate
was stamped up above. You will come

1059
01:51:29,642 --> 01:51:32,517
Mummy has even thought up names
for our kids. Want to hear?

1060
01:51:34,308 --> 01:51:37,058
Sweetheart, here comes
their Uncle Jai

1061
01:51:54,475 --> 01:51:56,517
Kabir bhai, happy new year

1062
01:51:57,683 --> 01:52:02,767
You took long
l was just telling Sheena

1063
01:52:03,517 --> 01:52:05,558
You're late. She went off to sleep

1064
01:52:05,767 --> 01:52:06,767
Bored

1065
01:52:10,475 --> 01:52:11,308
What...?

1066
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:14,767
Everyone warned me.
l never heeded

1067
01:52:30,350 --> 01:52:32,683
First ever time l failed
to make out a man

1068
01:52:47,142 --> 01:52:52,142
Sheena, l guess you hate him the most

1069
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:19,058
Sweetheart. You'll kill me?

1070
01:53:44,808 --> 01:53:48,267
Not here. Let's move out.

1071
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:51,558
Come on Sheena
Come on let's go

1072
01:53:51,767 --> 01:53:53,308
She isn't coming

1073
01:54:02,475 --> 01:54:10,850
Sweetheart... they're gone
You didn't

1074
01:54:24,267 --> 01:54:27,017
Now l'm relaxed

1075
01:54:30,642 --> 01:54:34,475
Move Ali
- Now...?

1076
01:54:34,725 --> 01:54:37,850
No l'm staying here

1077
01:54:41,267 --> 01:54:42,642
Crazy

1078
01:54:45,808 --> 01:54:52,558
l'll be back
Sweetheart, don't vanish again

1079
01:55:14,308 --> 01:55:16,892
Yes yes. Thank you

1080
01:55:17,808 --> 01:55:19,350
Very okay very okay

1081
01:55:20,933 --> 01:55:22,267
Your timing's all out.

1082
01:55:22,517 --> 01:55:24,725
First time in life...
l start on a love scene.

1083
01:55:24,933 --> 01:55:25,933
And you get shooting

1084
01:55:26,142 --> 01:55:28,725
l could've been shot.
- Were you?

1085
01:55:28,933 --> 01:55:32,017
Where we you when he was
grinding me at gunpoint?

1086
01:55:33,808 --> 01:55:37,392
Didn't l save you?
- My good luck. Mummy's blessings

1087
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,433
Thank you Mummy

1088
01:55:39,017 --> 01:55:40,683
You didn't take the bullet.
- lf l did...

1089
01:55:41,267 --> 01:55:42,600
l'd end up in a police station.

1090
01:55:42,808 --> 01:55:44,517
Martyr in a photo frame

1091
01:55:44,725 --> 01:55:49,558
Police station?

Until we've caught them,

You swim?

Hold on

1101
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:09,267
Buck up

1102
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:21,267
Boating on streets
Needs a driving lesson

1103
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:40,933

1104
01:58:46,850 --> 01:58:47,600

1111
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,142
You're blocking my view

1112
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:34,850
Why aren't you stopping? Stop

1113
02:02:35,058 --> 02:02:36,933

You'll never catch me

1123
02:05:04,933 --> 02:05:06,392
What a waste of life

1124
02:05:08,267 --> 02:05:12,933
lf you weren't a thief
we would've been friends

1125
02:05:19,808 --> 02:05:22,183
Now l'm a policeman?

1126
02:05:22,392 --> 02:05:27,392

02:05:38,267 --> 02:05:42,642
Okay don't send Sheena to jail.
- Why? She isn't a thief?

1132
02:05:43,058 --> 02:05:47,142
But she's marrying a policeman.
She deserves a discount?

1133
02:05:47,767 --> 02:05:53,475
A reservation in ladies' jail.
- Only if l'm posted there

1134
02:05:54,058 --> 02:05:55,558
Yes...?
- Shut up
