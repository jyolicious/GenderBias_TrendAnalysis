1
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,710
Keep it.

2
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,169
Is the cocaine in the case?

3
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,043
No TJ.

4
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,170
I'm here to give you
my birthday card.

5
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,426
Where is my money?

6
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,259
Right here.

7
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:36,799
Here's your full and final payment.

8
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,250
Now...

9
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,756
Put your hands up.

10
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:42,717
No...

11
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:43,550
Put them up.

12
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,218
Relax sweetheart!

13
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,177
I said 'No' because TJ...

14
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,797
...forgot to say 'Please'.

15
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,007
Please... put your hands up.

16
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:59,011
You think you're very smart.

17
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,333
But not this time.

18
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,136
This time I keep the case for free.

19
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:07,592
And because I know that you will
want to avenge this day...

20
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,880
...you'll have to die.

21
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,375
TJ!

22
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:17,376
Do you know that there are
36 points on the human body...

23
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,131
...if struck right...

24
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,555
...could prove fatal.

25
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,583
Is that so?

26
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,593
Its just that I'm in a
dilemma now.

27
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:26,334
About what?

28
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,150
About who, between
the two of you...

29
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:29,792
...I should I kill first!

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,877
I always liked you Don.

31
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,458
Me too, TJ.

32
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,083
I've also always...

33
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,750
...liked me.

34
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,459
Don't shoot don't shoot...

35
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,418
If you kill me...

36
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,506
...my men won't let you live long.

37
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,083
You will get caught.

38
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,418
No, TJ.

39
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,518
Not only is it difficult to
catch Don...

40
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,668
It's Impossible!

41
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,710
I want to thank you...

42
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,173
...for your help on behalf
of our government.

43
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,844
We know the gang
we're looking for...

44
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:27,170
...has made Kuala Lumpur its base.

45
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,005
Our Chief Investigating Officer Mr. De Silva
will give you all the details.

46
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,125
Sir...

47
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Thank you Verma.

48
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,923
Gentlemen I'll come to the point.

49
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,667
Firstly, let me tell you all we know
about this gang.

50
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,083
Verma...

51
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:57,969
When the Soviet Union split up in 1990,
a number of small nations were born.

52
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,795
Selling arms to terrorists and
fundamentalist groups...

53
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,716
...became a lucrative business for
a few people in these countries.

54
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:10,547
One of the new empires built with this money
was headed by a man named Boris.

55
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,043
Verma...

56
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,584
When these empires crumbled under
international pressure...

57
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,798
...Boris disappeared.

58
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,268
And when he wasn't found
after years of searching...

59
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,841
...he was presumed dead.

60
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,880
But Boris was not dead.

61
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,884
He had gone to India.

62
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:37,261
He invested the money he made
selling arms into drugs.

63
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:42,752
He bought drugs in bulk from
Afghanistan, Pakistan and India...

64
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,424
...and started distributing
them in Europe.

65
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,751
His two invaluable lieutenants
in this business...

66
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,421
...Vardhaan and Singhania.

67
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,591
We don't have a single
photograph of Vardhaan.

68
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,545
Nor do we know who or
where he is.

69
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,376
Reason?

70
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,885
This is Singhania.

71
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,626
It is rumoured that Boris wanted to
hand over the business to Vardhaan...

72
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,711
...but Singhania murdered Boris.

73
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,131
Did he kill Vardhaan too?

74
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,092
Perhaps he did...

75
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:25,047
Because there's been no trace
of Vardhaan since then.

76
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,506
And this is Don.

77
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,921
...who manages Singhania's
business here.

78
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:37,592
Given the information we have,
it is clear...

79
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:42,547
The most dangerous and cunning
criminal among them all...

80
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,922
...is this man.

81
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,755
Good shot.

82
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,131
Yeah, Narang.

83
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,292
Hello Anita.

84
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,377
Mr. Singhania had called.

85
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,548
He wanted to know how the
police knows so much...

86
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,589
...about our operation.

87
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,300
It's hard to say.

88
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,135
All our men are very loyal.

89
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,926
Is that so?

90
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,628
What madness is this, Don?!

91
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,632
Narang... this is a good shot.

92
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,627
Did you see Kumar's feet?

93
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,006
Terrible shoes!

94
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,006
I didn't like his shoes!

95
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,752
Ramesh...

96
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,507
This loyal man of yours was
actually a police informer.

97
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,594
The next time before you
recruit anyone...

98
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,671
...please get him to meet me once.

99
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,795
Or check his shoes, at least.

100
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,250
Kumar.

101
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,797
I don't understand.

102
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,215
How did they find out
he was our informer!

103
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:19,583
Good question!

104
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,333
You...

105
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,298
Vishal Malik. I'm with the Interpol.

106
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,750
I see.

107
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,840
- I am...
- DCP De Silva. I know.

108
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:38,969
And now I'd like to know how a fact that
only top Indian officers knew...

109
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,176
...came to Don's knowledge?

110
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:43,667
I don't know.

111
00:11:45,042 --> 00:11:46,259
By the way...

112
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,752
Who told you?

113
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,089
Excuse us.

114
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,802
I'm sorry, Mr. De Silva.
I wasn't pointing a finger at you.

115
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,544
Then who?

116
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,252
Inspector Verma.

117
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,426
See... he is young.

118
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,127
Recently inducted into the force.

119
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,542
Newly married.

120
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:12,213
Its quite possible...

121
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,008
Mr. Malik. I wonder if you're
actually drinking coffee?

122
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,501
Just checking.

123
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,298
I trust Inspector Verma.

124
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:26,375
Anything else?

125
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:31,093
Yes. I too am involved in this
investigation from now.

126
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,835
Hi Kamini.

127
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,176
That's great news.

128
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,925
Where are the two of you?

129
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,625
That was quick.

130
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,510
I am so happy, Kamini.

131
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:58,047
If my brother wants a better life today,
it's all because of you.

132
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,130
Thank you.

133
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,002
Anyways, our hero is in a
pretty bad mood.

134
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,417
Why?

135
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,005
Hi Roma.

136
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,094
I know a lot about them.

137
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:16,501
If Don even suspects that
I am leaving him...

138
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,210
...he'll kill me.

139
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,042
Ramesh...

140
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,380
By the time Don finds out
we'll be long gone.

141
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,129
Anyway, I am gonna see you
at the airport tonight, okay?

142
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:54,422
I know that after Mom
and Dad died...

143
00:14:55,792 --> 00:15:00,298
...whatever you did was, to an extent,
for my happiness.

144
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,969
But I wasn't happy...

145
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,667
...nor did I feel that what you
were doing was right.

146
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:11,167
...until today.

147
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,464
I am proud of you.

148
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,718
Yes, Narang.

149
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,835
Poor... Ramesh.

150
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,127
Ramesh...

151
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,877
Very sad...

152
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,833
Very sad.

153
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,802
I always thought of you as reliable.

154
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,463
But unfortunately, you didn't
think the same of me.

155
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:18,422
All you had to do was tell me
you wanted out...

156
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,667
...and I'd have arranged it
all for you.

157
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,250
Don! I...

158
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,426
Don, I...

159
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,669
Yes... what?

160
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,797
I made a mistake.

161
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,419
Why are you saying that?

162
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,881
Your love for that girl...

163
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,551
What's her name?

164
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:47,875
Kamini.

165
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:49,714
Kamini!

166
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:54,838
Your love for Kamini isn't a mistake?

167
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,125
Anyway...

168
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:02,295
I am here to say goodbye.

169
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,172
Ramesh...

170
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,922
Have a nice life.

171
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,833
Yeah.

172
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:17,089
One dirty fish can make the
entire pond dirty.

173
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,005
But if that pond...

174
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,260
...is to become mine.

175
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,585
It becomes necessary to kill it.

176
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,208
Ramesh...

177
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,801
People don't leave Don.

178
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,301
They leave this world.

179
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,844
Kamini, I need to ask you a
few questions.

180
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,589
What do you want to know?

181
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:23,045
Ramesh was always with Don.

182
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,750
Is that true?

183
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes.

184
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:31,126
Do you remember any particular place
that Ramesh used to go often?

185
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,583
Yes.

186
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,958
Tell me.

187
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,552
This information can help me
to catch Don.

188
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,003
It's not my desire to
get him caught, Officer.

189
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,003
Kamini, don't do anything that...

190
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,380
...could put your life at risk.

191
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,340
I don't care whether
I live or die now.

192
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,960
But the police department cares.

193
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,718
I'm trying to quit...

194
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,669
It kills you.

195
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,252
This camera... this pistol...

196
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,801
Why do you need
all this security?

197
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,008
Because a "Do Not Disturb" sign
doesn't work in this hotel.

198
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,134
What are you thinking?

199
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,708
I'm thinking that...

200
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,295
...I don't like two types of girls.

201
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,717
One, who take too long
to succumb to me.

202
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,005
The second, who succumb
too quickly.

203
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,211
And I succumbed too quickly.

204
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,218
What did you say your name was?

205
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,798
Sonia.

206
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:11,044
Sonia, the time between us meeting
and you being in this hotel room...

207
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,919
...is just half an hour.

208
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,753
That's because, when I
saw you I felt...

209
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,920
...it was you I've been
searching for.

210
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:27,466
Romantic talk bores me, Sonia!

211
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,296
Shall I get it?

212
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,001
No...

213
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,672
It's mine.

214
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,797
Why don't you go inside...

215
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,960
...and get into something more...

216
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,717
...comfortable.

217
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,208
Sure!

218
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,459
Yes... Anita.

219
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,458
Kamini...

220
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,214
Thank God you're okay.

221
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,583
Where are you?

222
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,085
There isn't anything else to wear.

223
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,167
I know.

224
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,209
Who were you talking to?

225
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm sorry!

226
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,130
Oh that!

227
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:25,755
To my Aunt.

228
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,629
She worries needlessly,
if I'm slightly late.

229
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,051
I can't tell her the truth,
can I...

230
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:33,589
...about where I am...

231
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,380
...and who I'm with.

232
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,552
Bring your Aunt along next time.

233
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:42,255
She's not your type, Don.

234
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:43,839
Oh... yes.

235
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,135
Why the hurry?

236
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:53,626
Why else would I want
to be here?

237
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,094
This heart of mine,

238
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:38,918
is crazy for my love.

239
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,548
His love is like a flame...

240
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,719
...burning in my heart.

241
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:51,383
I am willing to let this
flame engulf me.

242
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:59,117
You can't escape from
it's intensity either.

243
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:04,302
This heart of mine,

244
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:06,926
is crazy for my love,

245
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:11,136
This heart of mine,

246
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,960
is crazy for my love.

247
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:43,470
My heart always gets
what it craves for.

248
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:50,004
But my love can take my life
if my lover requests it.

249
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:57,129
My heart always gets
what it craves for.

250
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:03,753
But my love can take my life
if my lover requests it.

251
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:10,549
I gift you my life
in return for yours.

252
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,173
This heart of mine,

253
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:16,197
is crazy for my love.

254
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,010
His love is like a flame...

255
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,878
...burning in my heart.

256
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,836
Every moment that passes,

257
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,136
A storm rages in my heart.

258
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,216
As the goal I desire...

259
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,003
...is coming closer.

260
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,795
Every moment that passes,

261
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:14,253
A storm rages in my heart.

262
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,174
As the goal I desire...

263
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,961
...is coming closer.

264
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,052
You will never forget the day...

265
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,879
...our hearts collided.

266
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,093
This heart of mine,

267
00:26:31,117 --> 00:26:33,117
is crazy for my love.

268
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,010
His love is like a flame...

269
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:41,045
...burning in my heart.

270
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:48,385
I am willing to let this
flame engulf me.

271
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,634
You can't escape from
it's intensity either.

272
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,298
This heart of mine,

273
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:01,322
is crazy for my love.

274
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,215
This heart of mine,

275
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,239
is crazy for my love.

276
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,675
Your Aunt is outside, along with
a bunch of uncles!

277
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:38,087
May I know the reason
for this family reunion?

278
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:40,465
Ramesh was my fiance.

279
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,548
He had never mentioned you.

280
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,844
I can understand why.

281
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,927
It's been a pleasure
meeting you.

282
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:53,218
The pistol is empty.

283
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,089
You're right!

284
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,344
Let's go. The police are
waiting for you.

285
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,632
The police of many countries are
waiting for me. But...

286
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,092
Sonia...

287
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:08,801
Not only is it difficult to
catch Don...

288
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:10,792
It's Impossible!

289
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,167
Really...

290
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
You know what!

291
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,798
You know this pistol is empty.

292
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,881
I know the pistol is empty but...

293
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:23,386
The police don't know
the pistol is empty.

294
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,006
And wait for my call,
is that understood.

295
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:26,841
Sir...

296
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,208
Verma...

297
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,297
Hold it right there.

298
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,919
Surprise... surprise...

299
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:37,547
Officers, please. Put your
guns down. Or else...

300
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,542
It would be wise to
surrender, Don!

301
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,297
I don't think so.

302
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,969
It'd be wiser for you
to move back.

303
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,002
I'm asking for the last time.

304
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,375
Or I'll be forced to...

305
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,708
Stop.

306
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:52,633
Okay...

307
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,501
Down...

308
00:28:53,792 --> 00:28:54,258
Good.

309
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,005
Come nice and easy
everyone down...

310
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:58,465
...and move back. A little more.

311
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,585
I just want to get out of here.

312
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:03,219
If you help me, this girl...

313
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:06,636
...will be grateful to you
all her life.

314
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:08,042
Thank you.

315
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:09,751
Good night... Gentlemen.

316
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,210
Listen to me... Don.

317
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,461
First, call the lift.

318
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,333
For the lady.

319
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,458
Go on.

320
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:22,759
Quickly.

321
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,339
Don, I'm unarmed.

322
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:30,008
I can't stop you even if I want to.
Let the girl go.

323
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:34,713
Of course I will. Once
I get out of here.

324
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,667
Trust me.

325
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,635
No...

326
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,342
Damn it...

327
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:45,708
Verma...

328
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,745
What's going on!
Who are you?

329
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,172
Questions later.

330
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,155
I have to get out of here first.

331
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,090
Put the pistol down.
You have no idea who I am?

332
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,801
Mr. Narang, Police...

333
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,834
Move...

334
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,708
Stop that car.

335
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,251
Put your hands up.

336
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,385
And step out of the car.

337
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,339
Out... of the car!

338
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,047
Wait, Vikram!

339
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,669
Let's go.

340
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,875
Go.

341
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:31,542
Who is this girl?

342
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,083
Roma.

343
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,010
She can be useful to us.

344
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:38,091
Or is she useful?

345
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:43,468
If you had seen her shoot
two cops a while ago...

346
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,157
...you wouldn't be asking that.

347
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,501
Really...

348
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,335
Yes, Vikram...

349
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,800
I'll be there right away.

350
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:58,588
Come, Roma.

351
00:32:58,792 --> 00:32:59,793
Go ahead Narang.

352
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:03,335
I'm in no danger from this girl.

353
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,127
So, the police is after you.

354
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,625
Why?

355
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,426
I'm charged with murder.

356
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,924
But as usual, the truth is
somewhat different, right!

357
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,594
Wrong. The charge is true.

358
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:25,259
What was his name?

359
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:26,884
Rajiv.

360
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,676
He was my sister's husband.

361
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,253
Your sister must have
felt terrible.

362
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,426
My sister is dead.

363
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,542
He killed her.

364
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,253
So you killed him. Good!

365
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:42,835
What do you want from me?

366
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,708
Nothing.

367
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:46,583
Narang Saheb said...

368
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,385
Oh, Narang...

369
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:53,714
Come closer.

370
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,333
Come on.

371
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,835
You know, what I think...

372
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:05,583
I think...

373
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:12,546
I think Narang wants to start
a new sort of 'trade' which...

374
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:17,635
Very good.

375
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:22,677
I like wild cats a lot.

376
00:34:29,292 --> 00:34:31,090
Wild... cats...

377
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,296
What happened?

378
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,876
What did you think?

379
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,627
She tried to kill me.

380
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:41,794
Relax... Narang.

381
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:46,052
You will work with us
from today.

382
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,627
Thank you Don.

383
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,585
Jairaj called from India.

384
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,756
He wants more cocaine.

385
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,547
I know.

386
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:10,927
Did you speak to Jairaj?

387
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:13,259
Yes...

388
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,757
I didn't say anything
to him. but...

389
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:22,085
...you are asking for more money
than Mr. Singhania had said.

390
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:25,052
This deal will bring us
profits in millions.

391
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,715
Don't you like such a huge sum?

392
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:33,803
It's not that but it's not your job
to make this decision...

393
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,593
...it's Mr. Singhania's!

394
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,469
Singhania makes the decision.

395
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,423
I do the work.

396
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,627
So what do you do?

397
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,131
I don't talk like a child.

398
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,960
Such arrogance isn't good.

399
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,708
Don't forget, this business
was set up by him.

400
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,127
Then tell him to come here
and manage it.

401
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:00,375
What's this?

402
00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:02,590
Your wedding DVD!

403
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:06,417
This disc has information of all
our business and contacts.

404
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:12,135
The next time Mr. Singhania is here,
you can give it to him!

405
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:18,303
Don, I'm not saying your
intentions are wrong.

406
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,218
All I'm saying is...

407
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,298
...you're moving very fast.

408
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,419
For what I want to achieve...

409
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:31,462
...this speed is essential!

410
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,299
But turning your friends into
enemies for this quest...

411
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,093
...would be a big mistake.

412
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,632
The biggest mistake, Don's
enemy can make...

413
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,801
...is to make an
enemy of Don!

414
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,419
You have forgotten
what happened yesterday.

415
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:57,792
If I ever find out that
your memory has returned...

416
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,550
Then remember this too...

417
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,298
The bullets will be real
next time.

418
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:08,334
Yes... Verma.

419
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,340
I just got information that
Don is going to India.

420
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,750
When?

421
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:13,875
Day after tomorrow.

422
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,085
For a deal with someone
named Jairaj.

423
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,173
We'll leave tonight.

424
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,336
And find out where
we can find Jairaj.

425
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,968
Deepak, come here.

426
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:47,636
It's not nice seeing you
empty-handed, Jairaj.

427
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:49,625
Where's the money?

428
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:50,708
In the car.

429
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,544
Hand over the case to me.

430
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,302
Nobody says please anymore.

431
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,130
As you like...

432
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:03,759
Here you go!

433
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,797
Sir, he's driving very fast.

434
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,628
Sir, he's very close but
he's moving very fast.

435
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:10,052
Sir, we can't see him any more.

436
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:25,216
Get out of the way, damn it!

437
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:13,758
Sir...

438
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:14,917
Come on...

439
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,377
Enough. You've run
quite a lot.

440
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:57,089
You!

441
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,177
Still angry about the
girl's death, Officer!

442
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,630
Shut up.

443
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,719
If you want to shoot...

444
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:12,294
...go ahead.

445
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:17,084
...but don't even think
about arresting me.

446
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,089
All right.

447
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,505
Have it your way.

448
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,950
Any luck... Verma?

449
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,375
No Sir.

450
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,131
This place is so huge that Don
could be hiding anywhere.

451
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:38,002
Sure, but for how long?

452
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:41,101
All the highways and stations here
must be under strict surveillance.

453
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,503
Have our men posted in
the hospitals nearby.

454
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:46,268
He won't be able to get out of here
even if he wants to.

455
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:46,838
Is that understood?

456
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,167
Right Sir.

457
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,261
No one knows where Don is
after the police encounter.

458
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,256
Not even the police.

459
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,176
I'm afraid that Don...

460
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,589
Don what?

461
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,550
I think he is dead.

462
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,335
Or, do you hope he is dead?

463
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:09,708
You know Mac...

464
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,003
I feel that he wanted something
to happen to Don!

465
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:15,003
- Oh! calm down Anita.
- No, I will not calm down.

466
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,127
What was your problem with him?

467
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:21,792
Was it that Don had become more
important to Singhania than you?

468
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,833
Mac...

469
00:43:23,208 --> 00:43:24,208
Take her away from here.

470
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:25,669
I'll go myself.

471
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,752
But remember...

472
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:29,843
If what you're saying
turns out true.

473
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,753
I'll hold you responsible.

474
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:41,933
- Good morning Sir...
- Good morning Feroz.

475
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,292
Feroz!

476
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,125
Yes... Sir.

477
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,333
Come here.

478
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,761
Perhaps you remember.
It was about a year ago...

479
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:55,467
A man had barged into my office
along with a small boy.

480
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:58,511
The boy's parents had
disappeared and...

481
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,169
...he found him on the street.

482
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,235
I had asked you to
file the report.

483
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,375
Yes Sir.

484
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,458
Bring me that file.

485
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,042
Yes Sir.

486
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,292
Vijay...

487
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:24,500
Every moment, every day...

488
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:30,884
...I long for you.

489
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:37,757
O Lord!

490
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,425
You must reveal your glory,
once again.

491
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:46,713
You must return next year,
once again.

492
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:59,383
You must reveal your glory,
once again.

493
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:03,672
You must return next year,
once again.

494
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:07,717
I will wait for you
with longing eyes.

495
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,674
Heed me, heed my plea.

496
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,718
Come back again.

497
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,627
Hear your devotee's plea.

498
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:18,169
Only when I look upon you...

499
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:20,381
...will my heart be at peace.

500
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:24,883
Lord O mine...

501
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,084
Dear Lord O mine!

502
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:03,342
Be it happy times
or days of sorrow...

503
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:07,633
Our hearts chant just one name.

504
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:16,092
Because of you,
life is comfortable.

505
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,129
You dwell in our whole being.

506
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:21,667
Every second...

507
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:23,926
...I think of you.

508
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:26,381
I am your fan.

509
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,715
I chant your name in prayer.

510
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,466
Heed me, heed my plea.

511
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,468
Come back again.

512
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,423
Hear your devotee's plea.

513
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,877
Only when I look upon you...

514
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:41,090
...will my heart be at peace.

515
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:45,592
Lord O mine...

516
00:47:46,208 --> 00:47:49,758
Dear Lord O mine!

517
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,421
You must reveal your glory,
once again.

518
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,880
You must return next year,
once again.

519
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:17,756
One, two, three, four!

520
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,798
Hail Lord Ganesha's glory!

521
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,085
Five, Six, Seven, Eight!

522
00:48:22,417 --> 00:48:24,511
Lord Ganesha is with us!

523
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:54,085
Lord O mine, Ganpati!

524
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:56,085
May the next year
bring you soon!

525
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:16,884
Is it fresh?

526
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:19,968
Here you go, Deepu.

527
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:21,292
Done counting?

528
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,126
Yes, uncle.

529
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,840
How much is it? Grand total?

530
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,756
3000 Rupees including the
last three days.

531
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:30,625
Yuck! What are you doing?

532
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,218
Sorry very much.

533
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,510
What is the world coming to'?

534
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,682
My voice has gone hoarse singing
for three days and what do we get?

535
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,627
3000 Rupees!

536
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:42,423
- Don't worry, Vijay Uncle.
- How can I not!

537
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:45,546
We'll make a lot of money over
the 9 days of Navratri festival.

538
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,630
Wow, Deepu...

539
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,049
We'll have to make money...

540
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:57,632
I worry constantly about enrolling
you into a good school.

541
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,044
Just want you to
pass high school!

542
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,458
But what can I do?

543
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:05,968
There's no money left after
rent and stuff, is there?

544
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,461
Hey, don't feel sad.

545
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:14,591
Imagine what your Daddy
would say if he met me?

546
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,130
"Why thank you! You've got my son
onto the street!" Isn't that right?

547
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:24,130
You don't know my Papa.
He'd never ever say that.

548
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,051
Really! Then what will he say?

549
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,333
Vijay...

550
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,260
How does your he know my name!?

551
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Vijay!

552
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,135
Oh! I don't want Ice cream
Please go!

553
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,627
I'm not selling Ice cream!

554
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:44,208
DCP Saheb.

555
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,594
I consider myself pretty smart.

556
00:50:48,333 --> 00:50:49,676
Actually I am.

557
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:53,007
But when you are keeping things
even from your own department...

558
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,301
...why are you telling me?

559
00:50:55,917 --> 00:50:58,090
I mean... this Don Sir?

560
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,844
What's he got to do with me?

561
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:05,710
Look at this first.

562
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,465
You'll understand everything.

563
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:09,792
Okay.

564
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,794
This is ME!

565
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,174
You're joking, aren't you?

566
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:18,625
No.

567
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,469
No! You're... not joking!

568
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,252
So then?

569
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,385
In that case I'm feeling...

570
00:51:31,625 --> 00:51:36,506
...that you want me to
take Don's place...?

571
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,125
Yes.

572
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,168
Don't mind please.

573
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:43,171
Okay.

574
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,751
You just told me...

575
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:47,761
...Don Sir killed one
of your informers.

576
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:52,967
To say yes to this job
after hearing all this...

577
00:51:53,792 --> 00:51:56,466
...you get what I'm saying?

578
00:51:58,792 --> 00:51:59,918
DCP Saheb.

579
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,031
Look at Don Sir! He uses his
gun without thinking twice...

580
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,467
...and me?

581
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:06,334
Forget a gun!

582
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,710
I can't even use a bicycle!

583
00:52:10,458 --> 00:52:12,335
Vijay, I agree this job
is dangerous.

584
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,750
You don't say?

585
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,799
But if we plan
each move carefully...

586
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,380
...it can be easily done.

587
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,464
Sure... sure...

588
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:26,717
Sir, I'm not afraid of jumping
into this well, but...

589
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:29,965
...you tell me...

590
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,256
If something happens to me?

591
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:36,880
Where will Deepu go?

592
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:41,256
I understand Vijay.

593
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:46,669
You must understand.

594
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,878
The people I want to catch
with your help...

595
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,544
...find it easiest to get kids,
like Deepu, hooked onto drugs.

596
00:52:57,417 --> 00:52:59,590
God forbid, if tomorrow...

597
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,504
...he gets addicted to this poison...

598
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,176
...how will you forgive yourself?

599
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,003
Look Vijay. If you agree...

600
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:21,885
I'll take full responsibility for
this boy's education.

601
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,629
It will give Deepu the choice
to be whatever he wants...

602
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:30,167
...a doctor, an engineer...
or a police officer like me.

603
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:36,377
All this is possible
if you want it.

604
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,300
Okay, DCP Saheb.

605
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:49,176
But tell me something...

606
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:53,004
If Don Sir's gang find me out
and you find me in a coffin...

607
00:53:53,792 --> 00:53:58,298
Deepu's name won't be cut from
the school register, will it?

608
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,631
Deepu education will be
looked after.

609
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:02,167
I promise.

610
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,005
Ok... ok...

611
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,343
One more question...

612
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,004
The fact I am Vijay...

613
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,627
...not Don Sir.

614
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,049
You alone will know that, right?

615
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:21,708
May God give you a long life
but what if you pop it...

616
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
I mean...

617
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:27,631
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

618
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Stop... Papa.

619
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:24,750
Where's Mummy?

620
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,125
Making breakfast.

621
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:28,302
And she sent you as her
alarm clock, did she?

622
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,684
Well, where's the button to
switch this alarm off?

623
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:31,834
No...

624
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,375
Thank you Sir.

625
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,089
So... what's the problem?

626
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,002
Just a moment, Sir...

627
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,006
Sir, is this the password
you entered?

628
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:56,208
That's the one.

629
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,218
F09AK74.

630
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:02,716
If you remember, while installing
the program I had told you...

631
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:07,923
...the password recorded in this folder
will be shown backwards for safety reasons.

632
00:56:08,458 --> 00:56:09,618
So your actual password is...

633
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,585
...47KA90F.

634
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,801
Oh God! Yes... I'm sorry.

635
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,584
Will that be all, Sir?

636
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:17,668
Stop! right here.

637
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:42,005
Is anybody there?!

638
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,253
Hello Jasjit.
I hope you are comfortable.

639
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,750
Who is this?

640
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,261
The man who can rescue you.

641
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,392
But you will have to
do me a small favor!

642
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,873
This is a strange way of asking
someone for a favor!

643
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,797
I like you, Jasjit.

644
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,505
Tell me something...

645
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:08,834
Isn't it true that Joshi's computer alone,
can unlock his safe?

646
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,208
I don't know.

647
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,458
Oh really!

648
00:57:12,875 --> 00:57:15,298
That means you were lying to Joshi...

649
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:17,635
...or are you lying to ME!

650
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:19,339
Look...

651
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,593
Think what you want.

652
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:24,760
But, just get me out of here.

653
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Why?

654
00:57:26,917 --> 00:57:28,464
Is it very suffocating?

655
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:33,630
If you want, we can send your
wife Geeta to be with you.

656
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:42,465
Take it easy Jasjit. Relax!

657
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:45,469
All you need to do is one job.

658
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:48,777
There are diamonds worth
10 million dollars in Joshi's safe.

659
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,427
Get them and I'll release her.

660
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,048
I want to talk to Geeta.

661
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:57,668
Of course.

662
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:00,800
Jasjit...

663
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:01,875
Geeta...

664
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,844
I am so sorry... Geeta.

665
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,761
This is all my fault.

666
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:11,669
Forgive me.

667
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,467
I love you.

668
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,043
I love you too.

669
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,128
That's very sweet but
I've got diabetes.

670
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,876
Now lets talk business.

671
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,710
The diamond company
Joshi works for...

672
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:27,927
...is on the 25th floor
of Belcourt Towers.

673
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:34,465
The security on the entire floor is the kind
required to safeguard diamonds worth 10 million.

674
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:39,175
We can get you to the roof
via the service lift.

675
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,426
Rest... is up to you.

676
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:27,542
Hold it.

677
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:28,667
Right there!

678
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:33,086
Take the bag off your shoulder
and put it down.

679
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:40,466
You must be wondering how
the police got here.

680
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:42,833
I'll tell you.

681
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,753
Mrs. Wadia lives in the
building across the road.

682
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,549
She and her husband
quarrel pretty often...

683
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:54,338
...and the poor lady comes out
to her balcony to calm down.

684
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,927
Guess what she saw
from her balcony tonight?

685
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:05,007
Inspector De Silva, please listen
to me very carefully.

686
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:08,136
I'm being forced to do this.

687
01:01:08,917 --> 01:01:11,466
Some people have
kidnapped my wife.

688
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:12,964
You think I am a fool...?

689
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:15,960
What's your name?

690
01:01:17,833 --> 01:01:18,833
Jasjit.

691
01:01:20,583 --> 01:01:21,960
You're under arrest.

692
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:23,708
Shinde...

693
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,255
Jasjit... Stop.

694
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:04,292
Inspector...

695
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:08,717
They will kill my wife!
I must go. Do you understand?

696
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:10,718
I'm telling the truth!

697
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:12,542
May be...

698
01:02:13,667 --> 01:02:16,796
But I am not authorized
to sympathize with you.

699
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,130
Take him away.

700
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:36,919
Any idea where Deepu is?

701
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,084
De Silva...

702
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,299
Your days are numbered!

703
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,209
Wow! Isn't this something?!
He's handsome!

704
01:03:19,625 --> 01:03:23,710
You know, sir... seeing a picture is one thing.
To be face to face like this...

705
01:03:24,792 --> 01:03:27,545
...Don Sir is alive, isn't he?

706
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,125
Yes.

707
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,211
The doctors have kept him in
a sedated state.

708
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:36,102
I personally believe that a person
like Don has no right to live.

709
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:39,636
But I need him now.

710
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:44,050
Vijay, I want you to study
him properly...

711
01:03:44,792 --> 01:03:45,792
...understand him...

712
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:48,711
Learn his habits,
his mannerisms, everything!

713
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,128
I will learn everything.
What's the big deal?!

714
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:53,465
Let him wake up at least!

715
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,004
As soon as your work is done,
I'll hand him over to the police.

716
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:00,214
I get it.

717
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:04,375
First...

718
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:06,844
All the marks and scars that
were on Don's body...

719
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:08,714
...need to be made on you.

720
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,750
Sure.

721
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:11,958
On me...!!

722
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:13,792
Yes.

723
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,085
The doctors here can
do it painlessly.

724
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:22,927
How can it be painless?!

725
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:32,583
Hi... Ashok.

726
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:34,625
He's all yours.

727
01:04:35,333 --> 01:04:36,835
Vijay, this is Dr. Ashok Khilwani.

728
01:04:37,292 --> 01:04:38,669
He will operate on you.

729
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:42,334
Everything ready as plan?

730
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:44,881
Yes, just a few
preliminary tests and...

731
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,510
...we are ready to get started.

732
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,750
I'll check everything.

733
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:49,917
Thanks Ashok.

734
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:56,292
What's the matter?

735
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,339
I've never heard that a
bullet mark on a shoulder

736
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:03,784
or a scar on the head
can be made painlessly.

737
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,840
- Don't be afraid.
- How can I not be!!

738
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:08,718
I was about to tell you...

739
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,959
I got Deepu admitted to
Malaysia's International School.

740
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:15,006
Inter... Int...

741
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,669
With that name, it must be good.

742
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,252
- It's one of the best.
- Best.

743
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,132
Now you stop worrying about Deepu
and concentrate on your work.

744
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:23,458
Okay... okay...

745
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:29,252
Look, I'll tell you all I know
about Don.

746
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,594
Besides that, I've thought of
another plan.

747
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:36,048
When Don, that means you...

748
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:41,631
...go back to your companions,
you'll be ill and wounded.

749
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:45,378
You will have lost your memory.

750
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:50,592
The more you learn about
Don's life...

751
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,379
...the closer I'll get to
regaining my memory.

752
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:55,667
Thank you.

753
01:05:56,417 --> 01:05:58,920
You think exactly like the
comic book hero, Chacha Chaudhary!

754
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:00,880
You Know Chacha?

755
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,428
Brain working faster
than the computer.

756
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:07,801
I'll tell you a
great story. Listen...

757
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:10,920
One day, Chacha Chaudhary took
his dog Rocket out for stroll...

758
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:12,833
You want it?

759
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,802
- Don never ate paan (betel leaf).
- Never ate paan!!

760
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,924
That wasn't very
nice of him, was it!

761
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:25,458
Well, I guess that
I must quit too.

762
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,297
Fine.

763
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:30,958
Come on Vijay.

764
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,426
Is this a binocular?

765
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:38,708
Neha...

766
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:39,699
Yes Doctor...

767
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,476
Start monitoring the blood
pressure of the patient.

768
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:42,592
- Why?
- Yes Sir.

769
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,801
Anand...

770
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,130
Patch me through the face map.

771
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,583
Doctor... sir...

772
01:06:46,875 --> 01:06:48,969
...it won't be too painful, will it?

773
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,583
No, it...

774
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:01,968
How long, before he comes?

775
01:07:03,208 --> 01:07:06,758
Well... Just another 48 hours, Mr. De Silva
and then he is all yours.

776
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,627
Good job Ashok.

777
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,427
Doctor, please come
immediately to room no. 2.

778
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,630
It's an emergency.

779
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:14,346
My God!

780
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:15,246
What happened Ashok?

781
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:16,452
Don is admitted in that room.

782
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,083
What happened?

783
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:19,172
Heart seizure, doctor.

784
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:21,059
Have you given the patient
anything to stabilize him?

785
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:22,403
Yes Doctor... 2 ml of adrenaline.

786
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:24,044
Get me a cardiac injection, Quick.

787
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,677
- What's the blood pressure?
- 210 by 120 doctor.

788
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,255
I said hurry up.

789
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,297
No...

790
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,464
God damn it...

791
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,250
Ashok...

792
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:51,550
You and your team know
nothing about this incident.

793
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,252
This operation never happened.

794
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:55,964
Is that understood?

795
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,125
OK.

796
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:03,050
The success of my plan is linked to
this secret remaining a secret.

797
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:05,542
Ashok...

798
01:08:06,792 --> 01:08:08,112
It's only a matter of a few days.

799
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:52,917
Hello...

800
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,625
Yes...

801
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,343
Where have you seen him?

802
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:04,033
- Where did you see him?
- Over there.

803
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:13,006
The doctors are saying that
he has lost his memory.

804
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,424
He doesn't remember anything.

805
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,093
Still, we must get him back
at any cost.

806
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:25,007
You're right... but how?

807
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:28,503
The passport they found in his
car was Malaysian...

808
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:32,257
...and they must send Don back.

809
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:34,760
Don't worry, Mr. Singhania.

810
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,208
It will be done.

811
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:26,542
Go back!

812
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Welcome back, Don.

813
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:21,625
That's right.

814
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:23,301
Your name is Don.

815
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:25,259
I am Narang.

816
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:28,380
She is Roma.

817
01:12:29,417 --> 01:12:33,172
All of us here, work with you...
and you work for Mr. Singhania.

818
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:36,256
You remember Mr. Singhania
at least?

819
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,376
I don't believe it!

820
01:13:10,917 --> 01:13:14,592
In spite of all the security,
they took Don away!

821
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,424
Don's testimony could have exposed
the entire crime ring.

822
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:28,796
But what can he tell us when he
doesn't remember anything?

823
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:32,632
I don't think he's of any use
to them now either.

824
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:33,922
Who is them?

825
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:41,171
Mr. Malik, whoever did this either
works for Singhania or for his enemy.

826
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:42,534
Like who?

827
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:43,625
Like...

828
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,255
...Vardhaan.

829
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:48,918
Vardhaan...

830
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:50,968
Where is Vardhaan?!!

831
01:13:52,167 --> 01:13:53,168
Have you seen him?

832
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:55,210
Do you know where he's hiding?

833
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,094
Do we even have a single
picture of him?

834
01:13:58,708 --> 01:13:59,708
No.

835
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:02,293
Please...

836
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,752
And by the way Mr. De Silva.

837
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:11,008
Memory isn't something that
once lost, can't be found.

838
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:13,673
It's just a matter of time.

839
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:19,918
Is this...

840
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,125
...mine?

841
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:23,667
Yes...

842
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:28,794
For me, Don isn't Don...

843
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:31,418
...without this.

844
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,333
How do I look?

845
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:49,422
You look very dangerous.

846
01:14:55,583 --> 01:14:56,675
Mr. Mallik...

847
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,673
It's been 3 weeks since
Don's escape.

848
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,173
Why can't the police catch him?

849
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:05,299
You tell us where he is and
we'll go catch him!

850
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,500
Please... Mr. Malik...

851
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:10,126
Look, until we get the right information,
or a witness comes forward...

852
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:12,590
...we must follow police procedure.

853
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,426
What's in it?

854
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:32,215
Our contacts, bank account numbers
and passwords are all recorded in this.

855
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,800
You had made it yourself
and put it in the safe.

856
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,467
Yes.

857
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,250
Yes, Vijay. Tell me.

858
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:51,467
De Silva Saheb...

859
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:55,421
I know enough about Don...

860
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:58,841
...my memory can return now.

861
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:00,125
Good.

862
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,798
We must do this with
utmost care.

863
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:04,419
I agree.

864
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:08,834
If you can't lose your
memory without reason...

865
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:13,087
...then it shouldn't come back
without reason either.

866
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:15,835
I've got a solution for that.

867
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,797
Tomorrow, make some excuse...

868
01:16:18,292 --> 01:16:20,294
...and come to the place I've fixed.

869
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:35,385
Who are you waiting for?

870
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,252
Maybe... you.

871
01:16:47,458 --> 01:16:48,584
Oh that...

872
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:52,795
You have done a lot for me...

873
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:55,794
I won't forget that.

874
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,377
There's a lot more left to do.

875
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,042
That there is.

876
01:18:02,792 --> 01:18:03,792
Don...!

877
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:17,468
It was like this the
other day too.

878
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:19,592
I was in my car...

879
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,843
...and the police
were chasing me.

880
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,048
They were shooting at me...

881
01:18:26,417 --> 01:18:27,634
And then I...

882
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:33,003
I remember everything.

883
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:34,792
Who I am!

884
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:36,635
Who all of you are!

885
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:38,630
I remember each and everything!

886
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,875
Mac...

887
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:44,171
Remembering your friend's
names is one thing...

888
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:50,838
...in our business, it's important to
remember our enemy's name.

889
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:53,295
Which enemy are you
talking of, Narang?

890
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,379
Vardhaan or that officer De Silva?

891
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:02,216
Maybe TJ is the one you
were thinking about...

892
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:07,672
...or the man who betrayed
us all... Ramesh?

893
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:16,338
I really enjoyed killing them all.

894
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:22,133
- This calls for a celebration.
- Oh yes, it does.

895
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,085
I am... back.

896
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:08,667
The people in this world...

897
01:20:09,125 --> 01:20:12,755
...have clutched their hearts again!

898
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,885
I have returned...

899
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:16,794
...bringing back with me...

900
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:20,633
...a lot of excitement!

901
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:32,383
Look who's here.

902
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:36,467
Back to rule your world.

903
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:40,467
Who's got you mesmerized?

904
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:44,342
For whom do you wait
with open arms?

905
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:50,007
Who is this charming man?

906
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:55,924
Recognize me.

907
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:59,011
I am Don.

908
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,796
I bid my life...

909
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:26,800
...and gamble with death.

910
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,885
I have no regret...

911
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:30,797
...nor do I care...

912
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:34,500
...who I make my enemy.

913
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:38,417
No enemy of mine,

914
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:46,542
will live too long.

915
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:50,171
I am very dangerous.

916
01:21:56,833 --> 01:22:00,087
I am very dangerous...

917
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:03,958
...and forever cunning.

918
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:09,335
Who is back to win
the world over?

919
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:15,420
Recognize me.

920
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:19,963
I am Don.

921
01:23:03,375 --> 01:23:04,877
Their eyes inviting...

922
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:10,715
...many women have
wanted me for themselves.

923
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:14,965
That are glancing into mine...

924
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,219
...have mesmerized me.

925
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:20,502
These eyes...

926
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:25,006
...tell me...

927
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,923
...that they are hiding
an intoxicating secret.

928
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,378
I am getting addicted to them...

929
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:43,761
I am getting addicted to them...

930
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,837
...and my heart is falling
under it's spell.

931
01:23:48,917 --> 01:23:53,844
Who is here that has
fallen under this spell?

932
01:23:56,667 --> 01:23:59,750
Recognize me.

933
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:03,963
I am Don.

934
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:33,083
Yes, Vijay?

935
01:24:33,667 --> 01:24:36,546
A deal is on at 7 tomorrow morning,
outside the city.

936
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:39,422
If you could come there...

937
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:43,427
...I'll bring the disc with me.

938
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:46,625
I'm sure...

939
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:51,004
...it has all the information
the police wants.

940
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:52,797
Can you come there alone?

941
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:54,759
Rest assured.

942
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:57,464
There'll be no one with me.

943
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:49,425
Mr. Narang, don't you think it's
unsafe for Don to go alone?

944
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:53,425
I mean, this deal could
also be a setup.

945
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:55,918
Don won't go alone.

946
01:25:58,417 --> 01:25:59,464
You will go with him.

947
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:01,252
Don't be silly Narang...

948
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:05,458
Are you telling me that
I can't do this job alone?

949
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,795
No. I know that you can
do it alone.

950
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:13,967
But Mr. Singhania has personally
ordered me to do this.

951
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:15,625
Mr. Narang...

952
01:26:15,917 --> 01:26:18,340
Can't Vikram or Mac do this job?

953
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:20,835
Why is it important for Roma
to go with Don?

954
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:23,840
Because Mr. Narang knows
me very well...

955
01:26:24,875 --> 01:26:29,005
...and when, where and
who to shoot...

956
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,377
...is something
I know very well.

957
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:11,009
Singhania...

958
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,094
Your time is up.

959
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:19,422
Tomorrow, the disc will be mine
and you'll be finished!

960
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:23,627
Tomorrow...!

961
01:27:24,792 --> 01:27:28,717
This one word separates me
from my success.

962
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,592
And don't worry.

963
01:27:38,792 --> 01:27:41,636
The police will never find out
that I have the disc.

964
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:45,302
Because neither do they know
that I am Vardhaan.

965
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,837
Nor is my photograph in
any of their records.

966
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:03,067
Is this a joke?!

967
01:29:03,067 --> 01:29:04,067
No, its not!

968
01:29:04,483 --> 01:29:05,400
What is this madness?

969
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,902
I have felt this mad since...

970
01:29:07,483 --> 01:29:10,987
...you killed my brother Ramesh
and his fiancée.

971
01:29:11,567 --> 01:29:13,911
Ramesh! Your brother?

972
01:29:14,275 --> 01:29:15,275
Yes...

973
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:18,741
And I didn't kill you
till now because...

974
01:29:19,483 --> 01:29:21,986
...I wanted you to remember
why you were being killed!

975
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,440
You don't know this but...

976
01:29:25,067 --> 01:29:26,364
I didn't kill your brother.

977
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:28,150
Good bye Don.

978
01:30:19,608 --> 01:30:20,860
Stop! That's enough...

979
01:30:21,317 --> 01:30:23,365
Look! Look at me.

980
01:30:23,983 --> 01:30:25,530
Listen carefully.

981
01:30:26,358 --> 01:30:27,459
You didn't kill me
all these days...

982
01:30:27,483 --> 01:30:29,643
...and for that, I thank you.
Thank you very very much.

983
01:30:32,275 --> 01:30:33,822
Now listen to the truth.

984
01:30:34,942 --> 01:30:36,489
The truth is...

985
01:30:38,650 --> 01:30:40,197
The truth is...

986
01:30:41,025 --> 01:30:42,025
He...

987
01:30:42,733 --> 01:30:43,733
...is not Don.

988
01:30:52,983 --> 01:30:55,111
Who can say that he is not Don!

989
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:57,780
Besides Vijay and me now...

990
01:30:58,733 --> 01:31:00,280
...only you know the truth.

991
01:31:08,858 --> 01:31:09,934
Where is the disc?

992
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:21,018
Vijay...

993
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:23,226
I'm sorry.

994
01:31:23,733 --> 01:31:24,829
I thought that...

995
01:31:24,942 --> 01:31:26,034
No, it doesn't matter.

996
01:31:27,817 --> 01:31:29,285
Anyone in your place...

997
01:31:30,858 --> 01:31:32,280
...would have been deceived.

998
01:31:34,775 --> 01:31:35,867
Mr. De Silva...

999
01:31:36,525 --> 01:31:37,617
Your work is done?

1000
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:38,900
No...

1001
01:31:40,317 --> 01:31:42,035
My work isn't done yet.

1002
01:31:43,983 --> 01:31:45,075
That too will happen.

1003
01:31:45,483 --> 01:31:46,575
Singhania is coming here.

1004
01:31:48,483 --> 01:31:49,483
Singhania?

1005
01:31:50,067 --> 01:31:51,067
Yes, sir.

1006
01:31:51,275 --> 01:31:53,322
He is coming to Kuala Lumpur
for a meeting.

1007
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:56,824
I'll inform you of the location
as soon as I know.

1008
01:31:59,442 --> 01:32:00,493
Good.

1009
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:02,638
Vijay...

1010
01:32:03,192 --> 01:32:05,786
You may have done this
for Deepu's sake but...

1011
01:32:07,025 --> 01:32:12,202
...neither me nor the police
will ever forget this favor.

1012
01:32:14,067 --> 01:32:15,114
Who is Deepu?

1013
01:32:28,733 --> 01:32:29,780
Vijay uncle...!

1014
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:39,826
Don't you recognize me?

1015
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,199
How can I not recognize you?

1016
01:32:43,608 --> 01:32:44,825
My... Deepu!

1017
01:32:45,358 --> 01:32:47,031
But, honestly...

1018
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:49,035
...for one second
I did wonder,

1019
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:51,991
"who is this smart young gentleman
running towards me?".

1020
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:54,201
This new uniform!

1021
01:32:54,817 --> 01:32:55,817
New shoes.

1022
01:32:56,067 --> 01:32:58,570
Well uncle, you aren't the
same either!

1023
01:33:00,525 --> 01:33:01,822
What can I say, Deepu?

1024
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:03,951
Your Vijay uncle...

1025
01:33:04,858 --> 01:33:05,858
...had to change.

1026
01:33:06,233 --> 01:33:07,233
But what about your paan?

1027
01:33:07,442 --> 01:33:09,160
Paan is gone!

1028
01:33:09,942 --> 01:33:10,888
Just a minute...

1029
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:12,277
Roma, this is Deepu.

1030
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:13,900
Hi Deepu.

1031
01:33:14,025 --> 01:33:15,151
Nice to meet you.

1032
01:33:15,692 --> 01:33:16,784
Hello... me too...

1033
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:19,244
And Deepu, this is Roma aunty.

1034
01:33:19,567 --> 01:33:25,370
- Uncle, is she your aunty too?
- Hey! Is that anyway to speak!

1035
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,900
Vijay...

1036
01:33:31,608 --> 01:33:33,326
The things you are doing
for this boy...!

1037
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:36,952
Who does this in today's time?

1038
01:33:39,442 --> 01:33:41,282
If anything would have
happened to you today...

1039
01:33:42,608 --> 01:33:44,281
...I would never forgive myself!

1040
01:33:44,817 --> 01:33:47,115
Please forget all about it.

1041
01:33:50,275 --> 01:33:51,275
Anyway...

1042
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:52,650
...I don't know...

1043
01:33:53,942 --> 01:33:57,617
Should I be grateful to Don for
making it possible to meet you...

1044
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:00,531
...or I should hate him.

1045
01:34:02,192 --> 01:34:03,318
Because I wonder...

1046
01:34:04,692 --> 01:34:07,195
...how you can even
sit beside a man...

1047
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:11,028
...who constantly reminds you
of your brother's death.

1048
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:18,192
I can't punish you for a crime
committed by someone else.

1049
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:23,650
And please.

1050
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,947
Stop addressing me so formally.

1051
01:34:27,483 --> 01:34:29,326
What do I call you then?

1052
01:34:29,942 --> 01:34:30,943
Aunty?

1053
01:34:53,442 --> 01:34:54,442
Excuse me...

1054
01:34:55,775 --> 01:34:56,396
Hello...

1055
01:34:56,483 --> 01:34:59,627
There is some Mr. Jasjit Ahuja
here to see you sir.

1056
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,401
Jasjit...

1057
01:35:02,067 --> 01:35:03,410
Jasjit...

1058
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,118
- How are you, Haatim?
- Very well.

1059
01:35:12,608 --> 01:35:13,608
What a surprise?

1060
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:15,675
My God, it's been ages
since we met!

1061
01:35:15,817 --> 01:35:16,817
Bangalore 2002.

1062
01:35:17,692 --> 01:35:18,864
Before you came here.

1063
01:35:19,775 --> 01:35:20,775
Really! .

1064
01:35:20,942 --> 01:35:22,364
How time flies!

1065
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:24,151
Unbelievable!

1066
01:35:24,858 --> 01:35:25,950
What brings you here?

1067
01:35:27,192 --> 01:35:29,536
DCP De Silva is in this
city right now.

1068
01:35:33,942 --> 01:35:34,989
Yes...

1069
01:35:36,483 --> 01:35:38,281
I heard about what
happened to you...

1070
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,400
...I'm sorry.

1071
01:35:41,775 --> 01:35:43,015
I couldn't do anything for you.

1072
01:35:43,192 --> 01:35:44,785
But you can now.

1073
01:35:45,983 --> 01:35:47,109
I want his address, Haatim.

1074
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:49,367
What do you plan on doing?

1075
01:35:52,692 --> 01:35:53,989
What time is the meeting?

1076
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,493
And Singhania will be there?

1077
01:35:58,942 --> 01:36:00,084
Good... I'll see you then.

1078
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:01,108
Vijay...

1079
01:36:02,275 --> 01:36:03,346
Well done!

1080
01:36:55,108 --> 01:36:56,280
Welcome back!

1081
01:37:00,442 --> 01:37:01,864
Perhaps you don't know
who I am'?

1082
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:04,114
I know you very well.

1083
01:37:04,817 --> 01:37:06,160
DCP De Silva.

1084
01:37:08,983 --> 01:37:09,984
Who are you?

1085
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:11,944
Think back!

1086
01:37:12,733 --> 01:37:14,406
9th January, Belcourt Towers?

1087
01:37:16,108 --> 01:37:17,930
10 million dollars worth
of diamonds?

1088
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:19,776
No!

1089
01:37:20,817 --> 01:37:23,286
Well, maybe a bullet could help
sharpen your memory.

1090
01:37:23,358 --> 01:37:24,405
Hang on!

1091
01:37:28,442 --> 01:37:29,694
Jasjit?

1092
01:37:30,608 --> 01:37:31,800
Yes...

1093
01:37:32,025 --> 01:37:33,117
Jasjit.

1094
01:37:34,317 --> 01:37:35,318
What do you want?

1095
01:37:38,317 --> 01:37:39,944
I want to kill you!

1096
01:37:41,192 --> 01:37:42,990
I hope you won't mind too much!

1097
01:37:43,317 --> 01:37:44,443
Look, Jasjit...

1098
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,948
Maybe what happened
to you was wrong...

1099
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:50,197
I was only doing my duty.

1100
01:37:51,067 --> 01:37:52,489
I'm a police officer...

1101
01:37:53,608 --> 01:37:55,952
...and right now it's crucial
for me to be somewhere.

1102
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:59,448
Or else some big criminals
will get away.

1103
01:38:01,192 --> 01:38:02,338
Let me go!

1104
01:38:03,317 --> 01:38:04,443
How can I let you go?

1105
01:38:07,442 --> 01:38:08,694
Look at these faces!

1106
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,993
One of them is my wife...

1107
01:38:12,108 --> 01:38:13,781
...who is dead because of you.

1108
01:38:14,775 --> 01:38:16,618
The other is my innocent son!

1109
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:18,447
Who knows where he is now?

1110
01:38:19,358 --> 01:38:20,575
Look at them...

1111
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:26,509
This boy...

1112
01:38:28,358 --> 01:38:29,504
Deepu...

1113
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:32,572
Is your son?!

1114
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:37,239
You know Deepu?

1115
01:38:37,525 --> 01:38:39,118
Yes. I also know
where he is...

1116
01:38:40,858 --> 01:38:43,452
...but will tell you that,
only after I come back.

1117
01:38:46,858 --> 01:38:47,858
Wrong!

1118
01:38:48,233 --> 01:38:49,826
You will tell me right now!

1119
01:38:50,942 --> 01:38:52,364
Jasjit...

1120
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:55,695
You can kill me and
take your revenge...

1121
01:38:57,108 --> 01:39:00,032
...but then give up the hope that
you'll see your son again!

1122
01:39:10,692 --> 01:39:12,615
I don't hate you as much...

1123
01:39:14,233 --> 01:39:16,486
...as I love my son.

1124
01:39:17,483 --> 01:39:18,529
Go.

1125
01:39:19,692 --> 01:39:21,410
I will wait for you here.

1126
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,526
Leave that here.

1127
01:39:28,983 --> 01:39:30,405
You do have to come back,
don't you?

1128
01:40:41,525 --> 01:40:46,452
Night and wine have met
we are intoxicated.

1129
01:40:48,692 --> 01:40:53,949
Body and heart
are both ready to melt.

1130
01:40:55,775 --> 01:41:00,326
Celebration surrounds us...

1131
01:41:02,733 --> 01:41:07,910
...but yet I am anxious.

1132
01:41:09,233 --> 01:41:11,782
Why does my heart beat faster?

1133
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:15,491
Why does my heart say...

1134
01:41:16,608 --> 01:41:21,819
"you fools do not know this yet?".

1135
01:41:22,483 --> 01:41:24,781
Tonight...

1136
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:27,698
Who knows what will happen?

1137
01:41:29,775 --> 01:41:32,494
What will we gain?

1138
01:41:33,108 --> 01:41:35,452
What will we lose?

1139
01:41:36,608 --> 01:41:38,861
Tonight...

1140
01:41:40,108 --> 01:41:41,701
Who knows what will happen?

1141
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,619
What will we gain?

1142
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:49,577
What will we lose?

1143
01:42:09,317 --> 01:42:14,528
What will happen
in just a few moments?

1144
01:42:16,317 --> 01:42:21,528
What was always mine
will be mine again.

1145
01:42:23,317 --> 01:42:28,528
The night will decide
who resides in who's heart.

1146
01:42:29,775 --> 01:42:32,278
The decision has been made...

1147
01:42:33,483 --> 01:42:35,986
...that I will be victorious.

1148
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:42,407
You fools do not know this yet.

1149
01:42:43,192 --> 01:42:45,490
Tonight...

1150
01:42:46,692 --> 01:42:49,241
Who knows what will happen?

1151
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,153
What will we gain?

1152
01:42:53,817 --> 01:42:56,161
What will we lose?

1153
01:42:57,317 --> 01:42:59,615
Tonight...

1154
01:43:00,817 --> 01:43:03,286
Who knows what will happen?

1155
01:43:04,525 --> 01:43:07,278
What will we gain?

1156
01:43:07,942 --> 01:43:10,286
What will we lose?

1157
01:43:58,067 --> 01:44:02,652
Come, let me tell you
something, secretly.

1158
01:44:05,108 --> 01:44:11,036
Soon, the night is going to
change its hue, secretly.

1159
01:44:12,192 --> 01:44:17,028
Then I will take you away
with me, secretly.

1160
01:44:18,442 --> 01:44:21,241
Where will you go?

1161
01:44:21,942 --> 01:44:24,786
Look! Here I am.

1162
01:44:25,817 --> 01:44:31,028
You fools do not know this yet.

1163
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,198
Tonight...

1164
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,869
Who knows what will happen?

1165
01:44:39,108 --> 01:44:41,907
What will we gain?

1166
01:44:42,525 --> 01:44:44,869
What will we lose?

1167
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,801
Move it...!

1168
01:47:30,983 --> 01:47:33,611
Put your gun down.

1169
01:47:37,358 --> 01:47:39,406
Open the door.

1170
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:43,246
Let him go.

1171
01:47:43,275 --> 01:47:44,367
Shoot, Mr. Malik!

1172
01:47:44,817 --> 01:47:46,164
- Mr. Malik! Shoot him!
- Shut up.

1173
01:47:46,233 --> 01:47:47,860
Let him go. Put your gun down.

1174
01:47:48,025 --> 01:47:49,192
Shoot, Mr. Malik!

1175
01:47:49,192 --> 01:47:50,284
Get into the van. Move!

1176
01:47:50,567 --> 01:47:51,864
Malik! Shoot him.

1177
01:47:54,525 --> 01:47:55,726
Do you want me to shoot him?

1178
01:47:55,817 --> 01:47:56,817
Relax...

1179
01:47:57,733 --> 01:47:58,733
Malik...

1180
01:48:00,858 --> 01:48:01,858
Close the door.

1181
01:48:02,025 --> 01:48:03,117
Shut the door.

1182
01:48:05,192 --> 01:48:06,192
Stop!

1183
01:48:07,817 --> 01:48:08,734
Turn the engine off!

1184
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:09,775
Now...!

1185
01:48:12,275 --> 01:48:13,275
I mean it.

1186
01:48:13,942 --> 01:48:14,942
Now!

1187
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:12,650
Yes...

1188
01:49:12,692 --> 01:49:13,692
OK... Thank you.

1189
01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:19,993
What do you think, Verma?

1190
01:49:21,817 --> 01:49:24,195
Is this man telling the truth
that he is not Don?

1191
01:49:26,233 --> 01:49:27,985
Don is very clever, sir.

1192
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:31,904
Claiming that he is Vijay,
Mr. De Silva's informer...

1193
01:49:32,692 --> 01:49:34,740
...is surely a plan to
escape punishment.

1194
01:49:40,858 --> 01:49:42,030
Hmm? Lets do this...

1195
01:49:42,608 --> 01:49:44,451
Bring Narang and Mac here.

1196
01:49:44,983 --> 01:49:47,202
Let them hear what he's saying.

1197
01:49:48,025 --> 01:49:49,402
Perhaps his words...

1198
01:49:50,567 --> 01:49:51,989
...can break them.

1199
01:49:52,817 --> 01:49:55,536
Mr. Malik, how many times do
I have to tell you I'm not Don!

1200
01:49:56,150 --> 01:49:57,670
I'm Vijay...
De Silva Saheb's informer.

1201
01:49:58,233 --> 01:50:01,237
If Singhania's men are behind bars
today, it's all due to me.

1202
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:04,323
And why don't you go ask
De Silva Saheb who I am?

1203
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:07,028
DCP De Silva is no
longer with us.

1204
01:50:07,608 --> 01:50:08,608
He's dead.

1205
01:50:08,733 --> 01:50:09,733
Dead?

1206
01:50:17,108 --> 01:50:18,109
Just a minute!

1207
01:50:18,983 --> 01:50:19,983
Then...

1208
01:50:20,567 --> 01:50:22,114
Where's the disc I gave him?

1209
01:50:22,525 --> 01:50:23,525
What disc?

1210
01:50:24,483 --> 01:50:28,683
I had given him a disc that contained information
of Singhania's contacts and bank accounts.

1211
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,529
I'm sorry but he didn't mention
any such disc.

1212
01:50:32,942 --> 01:50:34,034
But it must be somewhere!

1213
01:50:34,442 --> 01:50:36,661
...In his apartment or
somewhere here...

1214
01:50:37,858 --> 01:50:39,326
...in his desk... or...

1215
01:50:40,025 --> 01:50:41,142
Mr. Malik!

1216
01:50:41,775 --> 01:50:43,118
If I were Don...

1217
01:50:43,608 --> 01:50:46,031
...how would I know that
he had this disc?

1218
01:50:58,358 --> 01:51:02,909
DCP De Silva's informer has
told us quite a lot about you.

1219
01:51:04,275 --> 01:51:07,449
Now if there is anything,
you two would like to say?

1220
01:51:07,942 --> 01:51:09,569
What are you saying, Mr. Malik?

1221
01:51:10,442 --> 01:51:11,489
This man is Don.

1222
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,823
And he is doing what
he knows best.

1223
01:51:15,150 --> 01:51:16,426
What's that?

1224
01:51:17,442 --> 01:51:19,615
Making police officers like you
look like fools.

1225
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:20,716
Shut up.

1226
01:51:21,775 --> 01:51:22,921
Take them away.

1227
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,655
Verma, take a small team to
DCP De Silva's apartment.

1228
01:51:39,608 --> 01:51:41,030
If that disc is there...

1229
01:51:41,817 --> 01:51:43,697
...it's possible this man is
speaking the truth.

1230
01:51:44,108 --> 01:51:45,781
He is telling the truth.

1231
01:51:46,817 --> 01:51:47,864
He is not Don.

1232
01:52:10,192 --> 01:52:11,819
Malik Saheb, I'm telling the truth...

1233
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:14,070
I gave De Silva Saheb the
disc with my own hands!

1234
01:52:21,025 --> 01:52:23,073
You don't believe me, do you?

1235
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:25,448
Don, I gave you a chance...

1236
01:52:26,067 --> 01:52:28,820
But now even you can't deny
the fact that you are Don.

1237
01:52:29,025 --> 01:52:30,025
I'm sorry.

1238
01:52:30,233 --> 01:52:31,576
Verma... just send
the guards in!

1239
01:52:31,608 --> 01:52:32,608
Wait...!

1240
01:52:32,817 --> 01:52:34,034
There is another proof...

1241
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,697
Dr. Ashok Khilwani!

1242
01:52:38,358 --> 01:52:40,952
He operated on me to
make me look like Don.

1243
01:52:41,275 --> 01:52:42,475
Please...! He knows the truth.

1244
01:52:42,608 --> 01:52:44,030
Please... Sir...

1245
01:52:50,233 --> 01:52:51,530
Thank you, Feroze.

1246
01:52:59,525 --> 01:53:00,525
Malik Saheb...

1247
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,197
...did you talk to
the doctor?

1248
01:53:02,608 --> 01:53:04,451
- He is not alive.
- Not alive?!

1249
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:08,029
Last month, he and his assistant
died in a car accident.

1250
01:53:08,442 --> 01:53:09,442
Malik Saheb...

1251
01:53:09,483 --> 01:53:10,683
Please believe me.
I'm not Don!

1252
01:53:11,108 --> 01:53:12,826
The Court will decide
this matter.

1253
01:53:13,025 --> 01:53:14,025
Please listen to me!

1254
01:53:15,067 --> 01:53:16,444
I'm Vijay, Malik Saheb!

1255
01:53:16,608 --> 01:53:17,860
I'm not Don, I'm Vijay!

1256
01:53:18,817 --> 01:53:20,660
Try and understand...

1257
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:29,867
Hello Vijay!

1258
01:53:33,567 --> 01:53:34,568
We heard everything.

1259
01:53:36,525 --> 01:53:38,118
Don't be silly, Mac.

1260
01:53:39,733 --> 01:53:40,733
I am Don.

1261
01:53:44,525 --> 01:53:46,573
I only said that to
confuse them.

1262
01:53:49,317 --> 01:53:50,534
What's happening?

1263
01:53:51,567 --> 01:53:52,108
Stop it.

1264
01:53:52,192 --> 01:53:53,163
Narang...!

1265
01:53:53,192 --> 01:53:55,286
- Please make them understand.
- Shut up.

1266
01:53:56,442 --> 01:53:57,442
You are Vijay...

1267
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:00,948
But if they attack you here...

1268
01:54:02,067 --> 01:54:03,660
...the police will realize...

1269
01:54:04,483 --> 01:54:05,826
...are not Don.

1270
01:54:06,733 --> 01:54:07,733
Get back.

1271
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:09,150
Get back...!

1272
01:54:16,483 --> 01:54:17,483
So...

1273
01:54:18,483 --> 01:54:20,281
Behaving a bit too smart,
weren't you, boy?!

1274
01:54:22,275 --> 01:54:24,152
Now get ready to die.

1275
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:28,699
The punishment for selling
drugs in Malaysia...

1276
01:54:29,650 --> 01:54:30,650
...is death...

1277
01:54:30,983 --> 01:54:34,066
...and the court will surely give
Don the death sentence.

1278
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,822
If it doesn't...

1279
01:54:39,983 --> 01:54:44,944
...we'll kill Vijay in jail.

1280
01:54:59,442 --> 01:55:00,442
What happened, sir?

1281
01:55:01,192 --> 01:55:03,695
They say that, till we
get a date in court...

1282
01:55:04,358 --> 01:55:08,568
...it's not safe to keep these
dangerous criminals here.

1283
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:10,572
So what is their intention?

1284
01:55:10,942 --> 01:55:15,698
They have a high security jail on
an island, five miles off the coast.

1285
01:55:17,442 --> 01:55:19,740
They'll all be flown there
first thing tomorrow.

1286
01:56:16,692 --> 01:56:17,692
Excuse me...

1287
01:56:19,608 --> 01:56:21,952
I need to use the
toilet please...!

1288
01:56:22,442 --> 01:56:23,785
Very badly...!

1289
01:56:26,525 --> 01:56:27,525
Hey...

1290
01:56:33,525 --> 01:56:34,525
Okay.

1291
01:56:39,025 --> 01:56:40,026
Come through!

1292
01:56:44,067 --> 01:56:45,067
- Hey... hey...
- Easy!

1293
01:56:45,233 --> 01:56:46,405
Okay... okay...

1294
01:56:47,358 --> 01:56:48,358
Sorry.

1295
01:56:59,567 --> 01:57:00,567
Come through.

1296
01:57:03,067 --> 01:57:04,067
Hi...

1297
01:57:08,192 --> 01:57:09,444
Give me your gun, Please!

1298
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:12,447
Just stay there.

1299
01:57:13,192 --> 01:57:14,192
Come on...!

1300
01:57:15,483 --> 01:57:16,530
Now the handcuffs...

1301
01:57:16,942 --> 01:57:17,942
Go on...!

1302
01:57:19,692 --> 01:57:20,692
Quick!

1303
01:57:23,858 --> 01:57:24,575
The other one...!

1304
01:57:24,858 --> 01:57:25,858
Quick...

1305
01:57:33,942 --> 01:57:35,142
Now give me his gun, Please...

1306
01:57:35,317 --> 01:57:36,864
Quick... quick...!

1307
01:57:43,317 --> 01:57:44,443
Take him with the others.

1308
01:57:44,650 --> 01:57:45,650
Move it!

1309
01:57:49,442 --> 01:57:50,442
Fast...!

1310
01:57:50,775 --> 01:57:51,776
Go on...!

1311
02:00:11,483 --> 02:00:13,406
No...!

1312
02:00:58,775 --> 02:01:00,322
Congratulations! Jasjit.

1313
02:01:02,733 --> 02:01:04,030
The information on this disc...

1314
02:01:05,067 --> 02:01:06,944
...is like a winning lottery ticket.

1315
02:01:10,233 --> 02:01:15,114
I know a man who can get you
a lot of money for this disc.

1316
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:29,197
Jasjit...

1317
02:01:33,025 --> 02:01:35,778
De Silva said that he knew
where Deepu was.

1318
02:01:36,650 --> 02:01:42,032
Perhaps, the buyer we find
may have known De Silva?

1319
02:01:44,692 --> 02:01:45,763
Haatim...

1320
02:01:45,983 --> 02:01:50,193
If he can lead me to Deepu,
I'll let him have all that money.

1321
02:01:56,275 --> 02:01:57,292
I see...

1322
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:00,369
And you have this disc.

1323
02:02:02,608 --> 02:02:03,608
No problem.

1324
02:02:03,775 --> 02:02:04,822
It'll be done.

1325
02:02:09,608 --> 02:02:10,608
Malik...

1326
02:02:14,608 --> 02:02:15,700
What!

1327
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:24,493
What happened, sir?
Who was that?

1328
02:02:27,233 --> 02:02:30,692
An incident on board forced the
pilot to make an emergency landing.

1329
02:02:33,192 --> 02:02:34,409
Don has escaped!

1330
02:03:07,983 --> 02:03:09,029
Thanks...

1331
02:03:11,150 --> 02:03:12,151
Thanks for coming!

1332
02:03:12,775 --> 02:03:13,867
Thank God you're all right!

1333
02:03:14,983 --> 02:03:16,610
You call this being all right?

1334
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:19,071
Vijay...

1335
02:03:19,942 --> 02:03:21,034
I know what the truth is.

1336
02:03:23,192 --> 02:03:24,209
The truth...?

1337
02:03:26,692 --> 02:03:28,911
Why will the police
believe you, Roma?

1338
02:03:34,608 --> 02:03:37,532
Only the disc can prove
my innocence now.

1339
02:03:38,233 --> 02:03:39,701
We'll get the disc.

1340
02:03:42,733 --> 02:03:44,735
The man who stole the disc...

1341
02:03:45,733 --> 02:03:49,067
...cannot be honest enough
to return it to the police.

1342
02:03:50,567 --> 02:03:52,535
He's sure to try and sell it.

1343
02:03:55,525 --> 02:03:56,526
Just a minute, Roma.

1344
02:03:58,025 --> 02:03:59,402
Singhania has an agent here...

1345
02:03:59,817 --> 02:04:03,572
...who kept him informed about
the cops and our enemies.

1346
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,198
He could be of use.

1347
02:04:08,275 --> 02:04:11,324
Try and contact him somehow.

1348
02:04:14,442 --> 02:04:16,285
But if you are found meanwhile...

1349
02:04:17,358 --> 02:04:20,282
I mean, the police will be
searching everywhere for you.

1350
02:04:20,692 --> 02:04:22,114
I know!

1351
02:04:24,692 --> 02:04:26,285
But where can I go?!

1352
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:29,822
There is one place.

1353
02:04:36,192 --> 02:04:37,192
Where is Ramesh's place?

1354
02:04:37,317 --> 02:04:38,318
Close by. To the right.

1355
02:04:56,108 --> 02:04:57,109
Stop please.

1356
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,617
Yours, sir?

1357
02:05:09,733 --> 02:05:10,733
All units respond...

1358
02:05:11,067 --> 02:05:12,067
Wait...

1359
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:13,447
We have a fugitive situation.

1360
02:05:13,733 --> 02:05:14,733
Suspect's name is Don.

1361
02:05:14,858 --> 02:05:17,361
Last seen wearing a dark jacket,
trousers and a grey shirt.

1362
02:05:17,775 --> 02:05:18,947
He is of Indian origin.

1363
02:06:10,567 --> 02:06:12,240
Who are you, Saheb?
What do you want?

1364
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:15,697
How does one explain who he is?

1365
02:06:16,567 --> 02:06:18,444
Just know that we are
in big trouble...

1366
02:06:19,608 --> 02:06:22,031
...and need shelter for a while,
that's all.

1367
02:06:22,858 --> 02:06:25,907
It's not a police affair, eh?

1368
02:06:29,442 --> 02:06:30,864
Should we tell them?

1369
02:06:32,150 --> 02:06:33,150
Uncle...

1370
02:06:33,942 --> 02:06:36,411
It's a police affair and...

1371
02:06:37,150 --> 02:06:38,350
...an affair of the heart too!

1372
02:06:39,817 --> 02:06:41,819
Well! I get it now.

1373
02:06:42,817 --> 02:06:43,818
You've run away?

1374
02:06:44,192 --> 02:06:46,570
No, uncle. I haven't run away...

1375
02:06:47,567 --> 02:06:49,569
I've been kidnapped!

1376
02:06:52,358 --> 02:06:53,358
That's great!

1377
02:06:54,442 --> 02:06:56,820
Where do we witness
love like this nowadays?!

1378
02:06:57,192 --> 02:06:59,695
Come this way, Saheb.
Come, madam.

1379
02:07:01,900 --> 02:07:03,117
Sit down, Saheb.

1380
02:07:04,483 --> 02:07:05,483
Uncle...

1381
02:07:08,025 --> 02:07:10,306
Saheb! Bhaang! (Milk brewed
with Marijuana plant extract).

1382
02:07:10,608 --> 02:07:11,434
Bhaang?

1383
02:07:11,442 --> 02:07:13,168
Tonight is Mahashivratri...
(Indian festival in honor of Lord Shiva)...

1384
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:15,786
...it is a holy offering
to Shiva. Drink!

1385
02:07:16,150 --> 02:07:18,528
Oh, the lord will bless you for
drinking his favourite brew!

1386
02:07:18,942 --> 02:07:20,364
You also try it.

1387
02:07:20,525 --> 02:07:21,697
Cheers...

1388
02:07:29,733 --> 02:07:31,610
Happy Mahashivratri everyone.

1389
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,529
It's all right, brother!

1390
02:08:13,275 --> 02:08:15,073
Honestly speaking, uncle...

1391
02:08:16,192 --> 02:08:19,867
If I had listened to my mother
when I was a boy...

1392
02:08:20,525 --> 02:08:22,778
I wouldn't be seeing these days!

1393
02:08:23,733 --> 02:08:27,613
Why? What did she say?

1394
02:08:28,733 --> 02:08:33,284
When I never listened to her,
how can I tell you what she said!

1395
02:08:36,442 --> 02:08:38,740
If you're done,
can we please leave?

1396
02:08:39,108 --> 02:08:41,861
Leave! But where do we go?

1397
02:08:43,025 --> 02:08:44,072
De Silva...

1398
02:08:45,733 --> 02:08:47,781
DCP Saheb!

1399
02:08:49,442 --> 02:08:53,868
You set up a good way to get me
up there before you left"!

1400
02:08:54,317 --> 02:08:55,317
Well done!

1401
02:08:56,150 --> 02:08:57,150
Saheb... paan!

1402
02:08:57,525 --> 02:09:00,244
Hey buddy!
I don't want it!

1403
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:03,952
Eat it. It's from Benaras.

1404
02:09:05,775 --> 02:09:07,027
Really?

1405
02:09:08,233 --> 02:09:12,033
But Don didn't eat paan.

1406
02:09:13,108 --> 02:09:14,108
Never...

1407
02:09:14,358 --> 02:09:16,531
Don, who?

1408
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:19,277
Don... Who??!

1409
02:09:21,067 --> 02:09:24,947
Don means me, meaning Vijay
a.k.a Don, meaning...

1410
02:09:25,733 --> 02:09:26,780
- Paan!
- Pawn!!

1411
02:09:27,692 --> 02:09:29,069
I didn't understand a thing.

1412
02:09:30,775 --> 02:09:33,198
How do I tell you, brother?

1413
02:09:34,067 --> 02:09:37,571
The plight I am in.

1414
02:09:38,775 --> 02:09:39,822
Tell us... tell us...

1415
02:09:40,317 --> 02:09:43,036
I set out to eat "halwa"...
(hot Indian dessert)...

1416
02:09:43,692 --> 02:09:45,945
...and ended up burning my mouth!

1417
02:09:53,358 --> 02:09:54,450
What can I say?

1418
02:09:55,108 --> 02:09:56,234
How can I explain?

1419
02:09:56,942 --> 02:09:58,068
I'm in a bad situation...

1420
02:09:58,567 --> 02:09:59,819
...that's hard to escape.

1421
02:10:00,317 --> 02:10:01,443
It's like a violent storm!

1422
02:10:01,983 --> 02:10:03,109
It's like a raging wind!

1423
02:10:03,692 --> 02:10:04,944
I've had to...

1424
02:10:05,275 --> 02:10:06,697
...run for my life!

1425
02:10:07,233 --> 02:10:08,359
Along and winding...

1426
02:10:08,942 --> 02:10:10,068
...chase has been on!

1427
02:10:10,817 --> 02:10:12,410
Day and night,
I've been awake...

1428
02:10:12,983 --> 02:10:14,781
...running helter skelter.

1429
02:10:15,650 --> 02:10:16,776
Sometimes this way!

1430
02:10:17,733 --> 02:10:18,859
Sometimes that way!

1431
02:10:19,442 --> 02:10:20,962
Sometimes this way!
Sometimes that way!

1432
02:10:21,233 --> 02:10:22,673
Ran this way once
and that way next!!

1433
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,060
Then you gave me this paan...

1434
02:10:24,608 --> 02:10:27,612
...and life has returned
to my tired body!

1435
02:10:32,525 --> 02:10:36,735
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1436
02:10:39,525 --> 02:10:42,779
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1437
02:10:43,317 --> 02:10:46,196
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1438
02:10:46,817 --> 02:10:49,821
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1439
02:10:50,233 --> 02:10:52,952
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1440
02:10:53,650 --> 02:10:56,654
Now watch the things I'll do...

1441
02:10:57,150 --> 02:10:59,994
...to straighten up everyone.

1442
02:11:00,442 --> 02:11:01,442
This boy...

1443
02:11:02,025 --> 02:11:03,025
This boy...

1444
02:11:04,108 --> 02:11:06,861
...this boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1445
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:15,278
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1446
02:11:16,317 --> 02:11:19,321
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1447
02:11:42,775 --> 02:11:45,654
I've been cursed!

1448
02:11:46,192 --> 02:11:48,615
...to be caught up in
this maze, alas!

1449
02:11:51,483 --> 02:11:53,611
My life is in limbo...

1450
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:57,528
...I'm at the hangman's mercy, alas!

1451
02:11:58,817 --> 02:12:01,570
So honest and simple,
So innocent... yes I am.

1452
02:12:05,058 --> 02:12:08,111
So honest and simple,
So innocent... yes I am.

1453
02:12:09,275 --> 02:12:12,028
Don't know how I ended up
amid this educated lot!!

1454
02:12:12,275 --> 02:12:13,572
With a sweetened knife...

1455
02:12:13,983 --> 02:12:17,032
With a sweetened knife
they've slit my throat!

1456
02:12:17,567 --> 02:12:20,320
This boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1457
02:12:25,775 --> 02:12:29,029
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1458
02:12:29,567 --> 02:12:32,446
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1459
02:12:43,983 --> 02:12:47,533
A lovely lass,
unique and desirable...

1460
02:12:48,858 --> 02:12:51,941
...her enrapturing charm
turns all heads...

1461
02:12:53,317 --> 02:12:54,864
...wherever she goes...

1462
02:12:55,525 --> 02:12:58,244
...and her body sparkles
like precious stones.

1463
02:12:58,608 --> 02:13:00,328
Her dazzling eyes carry
a world of dreams...

1464
02:13:00,442 --> 02:13:01,864
...her lips, youth's nectar.

1465
02:13:03,067 --> 02:13:04,489
A flirtatious swagger
in her walk...

1466
02:13:04,817 --> 02:13:07,195
...sprinkles the air with her
sandalwood-scented body.

1467
02:13:07,650 --> 02:13:10,620
The vision of her
sets your heart aflame.

1468
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:12,985
Her face is moon-bright.

1469
02:13:13,983 --> 02:13:15,860
Her eyes like a gazelle.

1470
02:13:17,650 --> 02:13:18,867
Her face is moon-bright.

1471
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:20,526
Her eyes like a gazelle.

1472
02:13:21,192 --> 02:13:22,193
She is beautiful...

1473
02:13:22,858 --> 02:13:24,030
...as sweet as honey.

1474
02:13:28,567 --> 02:13:30,490
A beautiful maiden...

1475
02:13:31,817 --> 02:13:33,660
...has fallen for me, alas!

1476
02:13:37,025 --> 02:13:39,244
A sweetened skewer...

1477
02:13:40,567 --> 02:13:42,945
...has pierced my heart, alas!

1478
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:47,904
So bright and fair
she's a spicy lass.

1479
02:13:51,233 --> 02:13:54,442
So bright and fair
she's a spicy lass.

1480
02:13:54,942 --> 02:13:57,570
A fighting spirit to match
she stole my heart.

1481
02:13:57,858 --> 02:13:59,201
Now that I have her love...

1482
02:13:59,650 --> 02:14:02,699
Now that I have her love
my life has blossomed!

1483
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:05,869
This boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1484
02:14:11,108 --> 02:14:14,362
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1485
02:14:14,900 --> 02:14:17,779
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1486
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:21,404
Eating a paan from Benaras...

1487
02:14:21,817 --> 02:14:24,536
...unlocked my benumbed brain.

1488
02:14:25,233 --> 02:14:28,237
Now watch the things I'll do...

1489
02:14:28,733 --> 02:14:31,577
...to straighten up everyone.

1490
02:14:32,150 --> 02:14:33,150
This boy...

1491
02:14:34,025 --> 02:14:35,025
This boy...

1492
02:14:35,692 --> 02:14:38,445
...this boy from the
banks of the Ganges!

1493
02:14:54,483 --> 02:14:55,304
Yes...

1494
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:56,622
Yes, it's me.

1495
02:14:57,317 --> 02:14:59,570
There's a buyer for the disc here.

1496
02:15:01,358 --> 02:15:03,952
Yes, ready to pay in dollars.

1497
02:15:05,567 --> 02:15:06,609
Just a minute.

1498
02:15:06,775 --> 02:15:07,867
You should speak directly.

1499
02:15:22,317 --> 02:15:23,409
We have Deepu.

1500
02:15:23,983 --> 02:15:25,826
If you want to see him alive,
bring the disc...

1501
02:15:30,733 --> 02:15:31,759
Jasjit...

1502
02:15:32,233 --> 02:15:34,577
If you want to see your
son alive...

1503
02:15:35,608 --> 02:15:40,284
...bring that disc at 5 pm sharp
to this address.

1504
02:15:51,233 --> 02:15:52,325
Jasjit...

1505
02:16:06,775 --> 02:16:08,243
- Haatim Qureishi?
- Yes?

1506
02:16:08,525 --> 02:16:09,822
May I come inside?

1507
02:16:17,025 --> 02:16:18,247
Who are you?

1508
02:16:18,900 --> 02:16:20,698
I've nothing personal
against you.

1509
02:16:21,650 --> 02:16:23,652
But if you don't hand over
the disc to me...

1510
02:16:24,483 --> 02:16:25,559
...I'll be forced to...

1511
02:16:26,650 --> 02:16:28,869
...change my mind.

1512
02:16:30,817 --> 02:16:31,888
What disc?

1513
02:16:33,942 --> 02:16:35,785
The one you wanted
to sell Roma...

1514
02:16:36,358 --> 02:16:37,434
Remember?

1515
02:16:43,150 --> 02:16:44,321
Sorry...

1516
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,152
The disc is with my friend, Jasjit.

1517
02:16:50,358 --> 02:16:53,862
And where is your friend, Jasjit?

1518
02:17:17,358 --> 02:17:18,429
Where's the disc?

1519
02:17:18,567 --> 02:17:19,638
Where's Deepu?

1520
02:17:19,817 --> 02:17:20,864
Deepu will come.

1521
02:17:22,192 --> 02:17:23,910
Call me when he does...

1522
02:17:24,817 --> 02:17:27,661
...you already have
my phone number!

1523
02:17:32,608 --> 02:17:33,608
Jasjit...

1524
02:17:35,442 --> 02:17:37,365
Seeing your punctuality...

1525
02:17:38,025 --> 02:17:39,072
I must say...

1526
02:17:39,775 --> 02:17:41,493
...I'm very impressed!

1527
02:17:45,192 --> 02:17:46,192
De Silva...?!

1528
02:17:46,650 --> 02:17:47,650
No...

1529
02:17:48,983 --> 02:17:49,983
Vardhaan.

1530
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:51,447
Vardhaan...?

1531
02:17:52,442 --> 02:17:54,160
But you...
...are dead?!!

1532
02:17:55,442 --> 02:17:56,442
Right?

1533
02:17:57,567 --> 02:18:01,526
For a man who can keep the
police in the dark for years...

1534
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:08,657
...creating the drama of a mere
accident is no big deal!

1535
02:18:11,275 --> 02:18:12,395
Do you want me to shoot him?

1536
02:18:12,567 --> 02:18:13,588
Relax...

1537
02:18:14,525 --> 02:18:15,596
Malik...

1538
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:18,492
Shut the door.

1539
02:18:19,942 --> 02:18:20,942
Let's go.

1540
02:18:23,192 --> 02:18:24,192
Stop!

1541
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:28,192
Turn the engine off.

1542
02:18:29,692 --> 02:18:30,692
I mean it.

1543
02:18:31,108 --> 02:18:32,284
Come on.

1544
02:18:50,650 --> 02:18:51,776
You're very cunning.

1545
02:18:52,817 --> 02:18:53,959
Thank you.

1546
02:18:54,525 --> 02:18:56,448
Now all I want is the disc...

1547
02:18:57,317 --> 02:18:58,694
...which you will give me.

1548
02:18:59,858 --> 02:19:00,858
I don't believe it.

1549
02:19:02,983 --> 02:19:04,155
Now I get it!

1550
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:08,733
Why the police didn't find
the diamonds in that basement.

1551
02:19:09,983 --> 02:19:11,485
I recognise that ring.

1552
02:19:12,942 --> 02:19:13,942
What did you think?

1553
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:16,152
I brought the disc with me!

1554
02:19:17,733 --> 02:19:19,827
Do you think I am a fool'?

1555
02:19:21,150 --> 02:19:22,150
Remember?

1556
02:19:22,775 --> 02:19:26,109
That night, you had asked me
the same question!

1557
02:19:27,192 --> 02:19:29,286
You have a very good memory.

1558
02:19:31,275 --> 02:19:33,152
It'll help in
recognizing your son.

1559
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:34,650
Daddy...

1560
02:19:39,192 --> 02:19:40,192
Deepu...

1561
02:19:43,942 --> 02:19:44,942
Vardhaan...

1562
02:19:45,442 --> 02:19:46,313
If anything happens...

1563
02:19:46,358 --> 02:19:47,358
Relax Jasjit!

1564
02:19:48,067 --> 02:19:49,785
I don't enjoy bloodshed.

1565
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:53,152
All I want is...

1566
02:19:54,775 --> 02:19:55,775
...the disc.

1567
02:19:56,275 --> 02:19:57,275
All right...

1568
02:19:58,442 --> 02:19:59,442
You'll get it.

1569
02:20:09,817 --> 02:20:10,817
Jasjit here.

1570
02:20:11,858 --> 02:20:12,858
Bring the disc.

1571
02:20:15,233 --> 02:20:16,450
My man will reach here at 7.

1572
02:20:18,858 --> 02:20:20,360
You and your son will...

1573
02:20:22,483 --> 02:20:23,700
...remain my guests till then.

1574
02:20:34,525 --> 02:20:35,572
Phone please?

1575
02:20:44,275 --> 02:20:45,275
Take him away.

1576
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:55,948
Kill them when you
have the disc!

1577
02:21:09,858 --> 02:21:10,858
Are you okay, son?

1578
02:21:15,233 --> 02:21:16,233
Deepu...

1579
02:21:16,483 --> 02:21:17,700
Listen carefully.

1580
02:21:18,858 --> 02:21:21,862
As long as they do not get
what they want...

1581
02:21:22,317 --> 02:21:23,660
...our life is not in danger.

1582
02:21:24,067 --> 02:21:26,536
- But daddy! At 7, when your...
- Nothing will happen at 7.

1583
02:21:27,442 --> 02:21:28,694
Nobody is going to come.

1584
02:21:30,067 --> 02:21:32,536
That phone call was
to buy us time.

1585
02:21:34,025 --> 02:21:35,698
I'm scared, daddy.

1586
02:21:38,442 --> 02:21:39,739
Don't be, my son.

1587
02:21:40,358 --> 02:21:41,701
I'm with you now.

1588
02:21:42,942 --> 02:21:44,022
Nothing will happen to you.

1589
02:21:44,942 --> 02:21:45,989
Nothing will happen.

1590
02:22:16,275 --> 02:22:17,275
Yes, Mr. Vardhaan.

1591
02:22:19,525 --> 02:22:21,118
Nobody has come so far.

1592
02:22:24,775 --> 02:22:25,775
Okay.

1593
02:22:36,942 --> 02:22:37,989
Find them.

1594
02:22:45,317 --> 02:22:48,116
- Now where, daddy?
- Keep it down!

1595
02:22:57,275 --> 02:22:58,275
Just a minute.

1596
02:22:58,650 --> 02:22:59,650
Let me see.

1597
02:23:14,858 --> 02:23:16,781
They must be hiding close by.
Keep looking.

1598
02:23:40,567 --> 02:23:41,567
There, he is.

1599
02:23:41,817 --> 02:23:42,292
Don't shoot.

1600
02:23:42,358 --> 02:23:43,735
Only he knows where the disc is.

1601
02:24:03,025 --> 02:24:04,948
Daddy...

1602
02:26:48,067 --> 02:26:49,067
Vijay uncle...!

1603
02:27:11,358 --> 02:27:12,358
Daddy, stop!

1604
02:27:13,317 --> 02:27:14,317
This is Vijay uncle.

1605
02:27:14,483 --> 02:27:16,986
He took care of me when
you went away.

1606
02:27:17,775 --> 02:27:20,028
Vijay uncle, this is my Daddy.

1607
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:34,650
Take it.

1608
02:27:35,525 --> 02:27:36,525
Vijay...

1609
02:27:36,650 --> 02:27:40,325
But for you, I don't know
where Deepu would be today.

1610
02:27:40,608 --> 02:27:41,608
Please Jasjit...!

1611
02:27:42,733 --> 02:27:44,610
Whatever I did for him...

1612
02:27:50,358 --> 02:27:52,360
Deepu is a lovable boy.

1613
02:27:54,525 --> 02:27:56,448
Anyway, why do you need
this disc so badly?

1614
02:27:57,483 --> 02:28:01,568
Just know that the only way
out of the mess I'm in...

1615
02:28:02,983 --> 02:28:04,030
...is this disc...

1616
02:28:04,942 --> 02:28:06,444
...and your testimony.

1617
02:28:07,025 --> 02:28:08,025
I don't understand.

1618
02:28:09,233 --> 02:28:11,110
Your testimony will prove...

1619
02:28:12,733 --> 02:28:14,986
...that this disc was
with DCP De Silva.

1620
02:28:15,608 --> 02:28:16,905
DCP De Silva?!

1621
02:28:17,317 --> 02:28:18,317
Yes.

1622
02:28:18,650 --> 02:28:20,850
He was the only one in the
police department who knew...

1623
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:23,073
...that he is not Don,
but Vijay.

1624
02:28:23,525 --> 02:28:24,526
But after he died...

1625
02:28:24,733 --> 02:28:25,733
He is not dead!

1626
02:28:28,775 --> 02:28:30,448
His real name is Vardhaan.

1627
02:28:31,358 --> 02:28:33,076
And just a little while ago...
I met him!

1628
02:28:33,233 --> 02:28:34,233
No!

1629
02:28:36,942 --> 02:28:38,194
This can't be.

1630
02:28:40,650 --> 02:28:41,947
I mean...

1631
02:28:42,525 --> 02:28:43,965
...your eyes must have
deceived you!!

1632
02:28:44,275 --> 02:28:45,902
No, I have not been deceived.

1633
02:28:47,233 --> 02:28:48,951
DCP De Silva is Vardhaan!!

1634
02:29:04,900 --> 02:29:07,949
He made me pose as Don...

1635
02:29:09,192 --> 02:29:10,865
...obtained the disc...

1636
02:29:13,317 --> 02:29:16,070
...and a chance to kill Singhania.

1637
02:29:17,567 --> 02:29:20,946
Then faked his own death...

1638
02:29:21,858 --> 02:29:24,532
...and left me to die as Don.

1639
02:29:24,983 --> 02:29:29,033
DCP De Silva... Vardhaan!

1640
02:29:35,983 --> 02:29:37,985
You've played a big move!

1641
02:29:38,942 --> 02:29:40,615
But he must never have thought...

1642
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:43,447
...that I'd steal the disc.

1643
02:29:47,817 --> 02:29:50,570
Give the disc to Vardhaan!

1644
02:29:52,692 --> 02:29:53,784
Vijay! What are you saying?

1645
02:29:54,067 --> 02:29:55,389
Yes, Roma.

1646
02:29:58,483 --> 02:30:03,694
A final meeting with DCP De Silva
is very important.

1647
02:30:15,733 --> 02:30:16,950
Don't worry, darling.

1648
02:30:17,983 --> 02:30:20,452
Today will be the last day
of Vijay's life.

1649
02:30:39,733 --> 02:30:41,781
I've reached the place
you told me to...

1650
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:43,451
...alone.

1651
02:30:43,525 --> 02:30:44,525
Good.

1652
02:30:45,275 --> 02:30:48,119
Buy a ticket from the counter.
There's a bridge on level one...

1653
02:30:48,483 --> 02:30:49,600
...come there.

1654
02:30:49,733 --> 02:30:50,779
And yes...

1655
02:30:51,150 --> 02:30:52,868
...don't forget the money...

1656
02:30:53,692 --> 02:30:55,786
...or you'll have to
buy the ticket again.

1657
02:31:52,983 --> 02:31:54,451
You seem to be in a great hurry.

1658
02:31:55,233 --> 02:31:56,450
Now where do I go?

1659
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:00,401
Throw the bag down.

1660
02:32:01,858 --> 02:32:02,859
What!?

1661
02:32:03,150 --> 02:32:04,823
Throw the bag down.

1662
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:19,493
I can see you, Jasjit...

1663
02:32:20,483 --> 02:32:21,905
...but I don't see the disc.

1664
02:32:23,692 --> 02:32:25,114
You'll get what you want.

1665
02:32:25,733 --> 02:32:26,859
Throw it.

1666
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:47,401
Looks good.

1667
02:32:48,275 --> 02:32:49,292
Where's the disc?

1668
02:32:49,900 --> 02:32:52,323
Upper viewing platform.
Silver briefcase.

1669
02:33:18,525 --> 02:33:19,526
Damn!

1670
02:33:29,275 --> 02:33:32,324
Poor DCP De Silva!

1671
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:34,150
You!

1672
02:33:35,275 --> 02:33:36,527
What are you doing here?

1673
02:33:37,067 --> 02:33:39,570
I should be asking you that!

1674
02:33:40,317 --> 02:33:41,534
You're dead, remember?

1675
02:33:41,858 --> 02:33:43,658
- What do you want?
- Answers to some questions.

1676
02:33:44,358 --> 02:33:46,281
Please! This is no time
for interviews!

1677
02:33:46,567 --> 02:33:49,070
All right then. Here's
the second reason.

1678
02:33:49,483 --> 02:33:51,201
I'm going to kill you today.

1679
02:33:58,108 --> 02:33:59,610
You have the guts to shoot?

1680
02:33:59,858 --> 02:34:01,735
You've trained me pretty well.

1681
02:34:03,483 --> 02:34:05,110
What will you gain
by killing me?

1682
02:34:06,275 --> 02:34:09,449
There are some deeds in which
profit and loss doesn't matter.

1683
02:34:10,025 --> 02:34:13,029
They just have to be done.

1684
02:34:13,692 --> 02:34:14,944
Very good!

1685
02:34:16,317 --> 02:34:19,992
But how will you prove your
innocence, if you kill me?

1686
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:22,494
Only I know your real identity.

1687
02:34:22,817 --> 02:34:25,366
Perhaps that disc can be of use.
What do you think?

1688
02:34:27,442 --> 02:34:29,115
You have the disc?

1689
02:34:29,692 --> 02:34:30,692
No...

1690
02:34:31,483 --> 02:34:33,810
It was my love for you that
dragged me here!

1691
02:34:35,650 --> 02:34:37,118
Give me the disc.

1692
02:34:38,192 --> 02:34:41,036
I'm ready to send you to
any corner of the world.

1693
02:34:42,525 --> 02:34:43,667
Think it over.

1694
02:34:44,150 --> 02:34:47,154
You must be exhausted
running from the police!

1695
02:34:47,692 --> 02:34:49,945
Not as much as from thinking
over and over...

1696
02:34:51,483 --> 02:34:53,360
...why you betrayed me?

1697
02:34:53,650 --> 02:34:54,822
Come on, get over it.

1698
02:34:55,567 --> 02:34:56,609
What betrayal?!

1699
02:34:56,692 --> 02:34:57,739
This is the real world.

1700
02:34:58,275 --> 02:35:02,234
You think Singhania asked me
before seizing Boris' entire empire?

1701
02:35:02,733 --> 02:35:06,237
I created the entire business!
With my intelligence and guts.

1702
02:35:06,567 --> 02:35:10,276
And now to get it back,
I can use thousands like you.

1703
02:35:13,525 --> 02:35:14,576
All right.

1704
02:35:15,233 --> 02:35:16,530
I betrayed you.

1705
02:35:17,692 --> 02:35:18,784
You want an apology?

1706
02:35:18,808 --> 02:35:20,808
I'm so sorry, Vijay!

1707
02:35:22,483 --> 02:35:23,504
Happy?

1708
02:35:23,733 --> 02:35:24,950
Feel any better?!!

1709
02:35:25,942 --> 02:35:27,194
Use your head, Vijay.

1710
02:35:28,025 --> 02:35:29,072
There's still time...

1711
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:31,197
Join me.

1712
02:35:32,108 --> 02:35:33,325
You will gain from it...

1713
02:35:34,983 --> 02:35:36,155
...and so will I.

1714
02:36:10,233 --> 02:36:11,233
That's the signal!

1715
02:36:12,817 --> 02:36:13,817
All teams move in.

1716
02:36:13,983 --> 02:36:15,063
I repeat all teams move in.

1717
02:36:16,900 --> 02:36:18,527
Good boy! Come...

1718
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:38,576
Put your gun down.

1719
02:36:38,650 --> 02:36:39,822
This is the police.

1720
02:36:40,025 --> 02:36:41,076
I repeat...

1721
02:36:41,108 --> 02:36:42,230
Put your gun down.

1722
02:38:21,358 --> 02:38:22,429
Stop, Vijay!

1723
02:38:26,983 --> 02:38:29,577
Don't make this mistake.
Hand him over to us.

1724
02:38:30,733 --> 02:38:31,859
Please kill me!

1725
02:38:32,733 --> 02:38:36,317
You will be making a huge
mistake if you let me live.

1726
02:38:36,775 --> 02:38:39,528
Don't listen to him!
He is trying to set you up!!

1727
02:38:39,817 --> 02:38:40,868
Shut up!

1728
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:45,030
Remember! Wherever you go...
someday I will find you...

1729
02:38:45,442 --> 02:38:47,945
And that day will be the
last day of your life!

1730
02:38:48,067 --> 02:38:49,319
Don't listen to him, Vijay.

1731
02:38:49,650 --> 02:38:52,119
After that, Roma.
Then, Deepu.

1732
02:38:53,025 --> 02:38:54,868
I'll kill them both...

1733
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:57,744
...unless you kill me now.

1734
02:39:01,483 --> 02:39:03,281
In that case, Vardhaan...

1735
02:39:04,317 --> 02:39:06,285
...I'll be waiting for you.

1736
02:39:17,525 --> 02:39:18,701
Hurry up!

1737
02:39:22,608 --> 02:39:23,825
Take him quickly!

1738
02:39:34,233 --> 02:39:35,250
Vijay?

1739
02:39:35,817 --> 02:39:36,989
Hold on please.

1740
02:39:39,650 --> 02:39:41,072
You finally did it.

1741
02:39:42,067 --> 02:39:44,115
You proved your innocence.

1742
02:39:45,233 --> 02:39:47,327
It wasn't possible without you.

1743
02:39:48,442 --> 02:39:49,518
Thank you.

1744
02:39:52,275 --> 02:39:54,494
Sir, we must take you to
the hospital right away.

1745
02:39:55,275 --> 02:39:56,021
Yes, of course!

1746
02:39:56,025 --> 02:39:56,867
Come with me Roma.

1747
02:39:56,942 --> 02:39:57,942
Excuse me?

1748
02:39:58,025 --> 02:39:59,317
Can't she come along with us?

1749
02:39:59,358 --> 02:40:00,150
I'm sorry sir.

1750
02:40:00,233 --> 02:40:01,359
Ma'am, please step aside.

1751
02:40:02,358 --> 02:40:03,008
Don't worry,

1752
02:40:03,025 --> 02:40:04,277
I'll see you at the hospital.

1753
02:40:05,775 --> 02:40:06,826
Vijay!

1754
02:40:09,983 --> 02:40:11,075
I love you.

1755
02:40:20,525 --> 02:40:23,119
Even I like wild cats a lot.

1756
02:40:51,025 --> 02:40:52,197
Come closer.

1757
02:40:58,525 --> 02:41:00,948
I like wild cats a lot.

1758
02:41:04,567 --> 02:41:05,910
Wild cats!

1759
02:41:10,233 --> 02:41:12,543
- Mr. Malik, where's that ambulance going?
- One minute sir...

1760
02:41:12,567 --> 02:41:13,876
To the hospital.
Why, what's the matter?

1761
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:15,026
He is Don!

1762
02:41:16,525 --> 02:41:18,573
"I like wild cats a lot...".

1763
02:41:19,150 --> 02:41:21,619
Don had said that to me...
whispered it in my ears!

1764
02:41:23,067 --> 02:41:26,492
If this is Vijay,
how did he know it?

1765
02:41:41,900 --> 02:41:44,153
Diazepam (a sedative)?

1766
02:41:44,608 --> 02:41:45,951
Yes Sir, Giving it right now.

1767
02:41:46,317 --> 02:41:47,333
Good.

1768
02:41:50,525 --> 02:41:53,028
The doctors have kept him in
a sedated state.

1769
02:42:04,025 --> 02:42:07,108
All the marks and scars
that were on Don's body...

1770
02:42:07,733 --> 02:42:08,780
...need to be made on you.

1771
02:42:08,983 --> 02:42:10,075
Sure.

1772
02:42:11,067 --> 02:42:12,284
On me!

1773
02:42:31,442 --> 02:42:32,964
I was about to tell you...

1774
02:42:33,317 --> 02:42:36,651
I got Deepu admitted to
Malaysia's International School.

1775
02:42:38,192 --> 02:42:40,615
When Don, that means you...

1776
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:42,868
...go back to your companions...

1777
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:45,777
...you'll be ill and wounded.

1778
02:42:46,858 --> 02:42:48,781
You will have lost your memory.

1779
02:42:49,858 --> 02:42:53,442
The more you learn
about Don's life...

1780
02:42:54,067 --> 02:42:57,526
...the closer I'll get to
regaining my memory.

1781
02:42:57,942 --> 02:42:58,993
Thank you.

1782
02:42:59,733 --> 02:43:02,612
You think exactly like the comic book
hero, Chacha Chaudhary!

1783
02:44:23,608 --> 02:44:25,781
Weren't you trying to quit?

1784
02:44:26,358 --> 02:44:27,701
What all can I quit?

1785
02:44:28,483 --> 02:44:31,407
I've quit everyone...
except you.

1786
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:33,321
Really Don.

1787
02:44:33,483 --> 02:44:35,360
I thought that you would
get caught today...

1788
02:44:36,650 --> 02:44:37,902
...or that I'd lose you.

1789
02:44:38,275 --> 02:44:40,073
To whom... Roma?

1790
02:44:42,108 --> 02:44:44,688
- What about the disc that the police...
- That's fake.

1791
02:44:44,858 --> 02:44:46,110
What's on it means nothing!

1792
02:44:47,817 --> 02:44:49,069
Don't worry, sweetheart.

1793
02:44:49,442 --> 02:44:52,036
Now the reins of Asia's
underworld is in my hands!

1794
02:44:52,275 --> 02:44:54,152
I am the king!

1795
02:44:55,858 --> 02:44:57,576
As for catching me...

1796
02:44:57,942 --> 02:45:00,036
Always remember this!

1797
02:45:00,358 --> 02:45:01,610
Please...

1798
02:45:02,942 --> 02:45:05,360
Not only is it difficult to catch Don...
