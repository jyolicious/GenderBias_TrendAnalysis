1
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,665
You and I..

2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,249
Because I love you

3
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,165
Boys get together and go out
Girls get together and chat

4
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,165
How will we get together?

5
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:19,040
Deep in my heart you and I

6
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:28,707
You and I..

7
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:36,415
Daylong of longings
whenever you're nowhere near

8
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,040
Who all were you with?

9
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,290
So if you love me?

10
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,749
Why didn't you profess your
love and you fought me off?

11
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,165
Now come into my arms

12
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:54,790
Boys get together and go out
Girls get together and chat

13
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:05,790
Deep in my heart you and I

14
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,999
First of all God created the word.

15
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,790
Then he went off to sleep over it..

16
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,415
and He conjured up a
guy and He was glad..

17
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,040
..that he rested for some more days-

18
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,999
That's when He made
His biggest mistake

19
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:25,832
He created a Girl-

20
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,749
Which done He lost his sleep.
So we lost our sleep too. For good

21
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:33,957
And the world was
split into two halves

22
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:38,290
girls and guys like you and I

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,624
You and I..

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,957
So what do we do about .. you and I?

25
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:56,707
Renowned cartoonist Karan
Kapoor's debut novel "Hum-Tum".-

26
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,665
is a national bestseller

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,332
First week sales crossed 10 000 copies

28
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:05,499
Publishers say that they have
orders of ten thousand more.

29
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:11,290
Karan Kapoor joins the press in
a first look after this grand success

30
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,082
Vedika from Mumbai for NDTV India-

31
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,665
How does a cartoonist
turn into an author?

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,207
Tried cartoons now I'm trying words

33
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,540
hoping to understand .. women someday

34
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,832
Come to grips with that understanding?

35
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,832
Hopefully after a few more books

36
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,874
And you'll write only on women?

37
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,665
Anything better more interesting?

38
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,332
Notwithstanding your digs at girls..
- indeed..

39
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:57,957
I think your novel is woven around..
your real life experience.

40
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:03,457
Look.- when love is requited..
there's no story left to be told.

41
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,124
A failed romance
isn't worth talking about

42
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,332
And unrequited love..?

43
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,707
True love never goes unrequited

44
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,249
it's consummated one day or another-

45
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,040
Because life's a long while

46
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,999
Many such romances in your life?

47
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,290
Only one object of romance-

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,082
But the romances she sparked were many

49
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,957
Mamma!
- Silence

50
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,374
Mamma enough
- Rhea stop it

51
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,790
My daughter is going abroad.-

52
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,915
Who else in the family ever went?

53
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,374
Who else in our colony?

54
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:59,540
And listen.. I've packed
lots of snacks for you

55
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,832
Spiced grams pickles sweets

56
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,790
Eat almonds every day
sharpens your brains

57
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,207
I'll miss you Mamma

58
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,582
I will also child

59
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,749
Your attention please..

60
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,457
..this is the last and final call
for passengers traveling..

61
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,707
Hey gorgeous

62
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,749
Karan where have you been?

63
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,290
Well.- - Something forgotten back
in the car? - Yes

64
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,832
Oh car keys

65
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:32,582
You see.-
- Don't even start

66
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,165
I don't care whoever she was.

67
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,415
Who said I was with any girl?

68
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,249
Hey who said I was with some girl?

69
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:41,665
Karan listen have you kept
your passport and tickets carefully?

70
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,874
Mom I'm going to America. To study.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,624
I think I can take care of myself

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,832
Rubbish

73
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,082
Oh no! Hey brother

74
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,624
Don't hey brother me okay?

75
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,999
I got your passport tickets

76
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,499
What would I do without you Mihir?

77
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,374
Grow up okay?

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,082
Sure Karan grows up someday

79
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,957
Hear that?

80
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,790
Thank God Shalini is in New York.

81
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,999
She'll take care of you

82
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:07,207
Don't remind me.
- She's your girlfriend

83
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,999
So? Never take girls too seriously

84
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,207
Girls are like buses.

85
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,415
There's one every two minutes
traffic permitting

86
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,165
Karan I have told you many times.-

87
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,957
..I disapprove of your
attitude towards girls.

88
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,582
And I've told you that before Girls.-

89
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,040
Are mothers sisters- I know.
But not my sisters

90
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,499
Karan You will learn to
show respect to women.

91
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,374
Says who that I don't respect women?

92
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,207
I respect you
I respect Indira Gandhi

93
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,332
Mother Teresa
Mother India Miss India

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,540
Miss India. Ooh miss India.

95
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,207
Keep Him on your desk.

96
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,290
Lord Ganesha Thank you for
sparing me that melodrama

97
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,457
Look

98
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,790
One minute Rhea..

99
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,249
Mamma enough. I'm off
- Listen

100
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,249
I'll be late for my flight

101
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:02,499
You always do that- - if you
won't stop I'll beat you. Wait.

102
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,999
Oblations from our Goddess of Succour.

103
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,957
Give it to the poor in America

104
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,915
Mamma!
- Never argue my child.

105
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,582
Do one good deed then
you'll deserve a good in turn

106
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,999
My tigress- Bye wish you good luck-

107
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,540

Your dad

110
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,540
I wish you'd mention him with a smile

111
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,749

What is with you guys man? Hey dad..

115
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,582
..I was thinking
this time for a change

116
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,707
..why not holiday with me in New York?

117
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,624

The way he talked

121
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,207
in all these seven years

122
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,790
did he care to call me up even once?

123
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,374
Anyway Better for you if
you stay out of this mess.

124
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,082
Concentrate on your studies-
- Yes studies

125
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,915
Bye mom-
- Bye dear. Take care.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,999
Mihir you'll take care of mom?

127
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,874
Like you always take care of her?

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,665
Come on. You make
nice-sounding parting shots

129
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,374
like take care of Ma etc.. etc.

130
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,457

I love you too mom. I love you-
- Yes yes. I love you- - I love you.

133
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,749
I hope he does fine

134
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,665
You're worrying about him?
I pity the girls out there

135
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,457
They don't know
what's coming their way.

136
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,790
Not bad. Do good and get good.

137
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,749
All the best Karan.

138
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,999
There is vermillion on your forehead-

139
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,749
Thanks.

140
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,624
Don't say hi out of the blue

141
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,915
Wait a minute in fact
don't even glance at her.

142
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,874
She might be watching you only.

143
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:25,499
Oh my oh god shit.

144
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,290
Praise the name of The Lord
Preserve the name of The Lord

145
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,915
Whatever hundred sardars say-

146
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,165
Sorry

147
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,624
Not one nice airhostess

148
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,249
Boring.

149
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:58,707
"I.. I and you.-"

150
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,332
Excuse me-
- Sorry sorry.

151
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:17,165
you know beer-dinner-playing
hard to get was a waste of time

152
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,582
When it's too late to even say hi..

153
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,874
Then you ask for a magazine

154
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,040
Excuse me can I
have a magazine? Please.

155
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,290
Yes sure-

156
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,249
Thank you.

157
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,957
Know what for three hours we've been

158
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,582
only two inches from each other..

159
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,374
..without knowing each other's names.

160
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,790
Strange?

161
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,707
Why didn't you ask before?

162
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,957
Rhea Prakash

163
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,915
Bond James Bond. No sorry.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,665
Karan Kapoor You can call me Karoo

165
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,082
Hi!

166
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,540
The makings of a highly
interesting acquaintance?

167
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,540
You and I

168
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:11,040
Not as in yourself and me You and I-

169
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,874
My cartoon character.

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,374
Excuse me sir- Would you
like to have tea or coffee?

171
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,999
Let's make a guess.
You're the tea type

172
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,415
One tea for the lady.
- Okay sir.

173
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,082
One coffee please with very
little sugar brown sugar..

174
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,249
..and just about two spoons of milk.

175
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,915
Okay madam I'll just get it for you.

176
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,915
Nice you avoid tea.
You know tea types?

177
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,624
My mother prefers tea

178
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,082
Correct.

179
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,165
Just what I was
about to say. Tea types

180
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,249
are conservative mothers
grandmothers

181
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,540
Coffee- Coffee is
a modern girl's drink.

182
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,582
Today's woman prefers coffee not tea

183
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,040
I am glad you are a modern girl.
I like modern girls.

184
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,415
Modern girls are modern you know.

185
00:12:54,708 --> 00:13:01,332
Hello.- sleeping beauty. Do you
want to come to Khandala? Hello..

186
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:14,040
Excuse me- Hi-
- Hi.

187
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,665
Our New York fight is six hours away

188
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,707
Airport squatting is boring.

189
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,082
Let's take a tour of Amsterdam

190
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,415
You got a visa-
- How did you know?

191
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:31,915
I checked your passport.
- What? You rifled my bag?

192
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,874
You were asleep. I was bored-

193
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,624
So I thought how I'd kill some time

194
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,957
How dare you.

195
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,457
You don't open a lady’s handbag-

196
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,832
Why what's inside a lady's handbag?

197
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,457
Okay I stand corrected.
I'd never do it again

198
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,790
I am sorry.

199
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,915
I can't believe you rifled my bag-
- I said I'm sorry

200
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,790
Where are you headed?
- I thought we'd sight see Amsterdam

201
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,707
"I and you.."

202
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,207
So where does our story end?
- Story? Ours?

203
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,040
Yes Everyone has a story-

204
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,915
So when we meet others
our stories meet

205
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,249
We'll spend lots of time together and

206
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,165
We'll look each other up in New York

207
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,624
Or we might say
goodbyes and never meet again

208
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,207
Yes..

209
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,624
No matter how long or how short
There's a tale of the two of us

210
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,082
Keep. Euro 1 .40
- What was that?

211
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:46,457
My fare.
- Don't be silly. Only 75 Rupees

212
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,082
Fifty-fifty- Why must
you spend on my tickets?

213
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,290
Yes how are we related?

214
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,207
it was a bad joke-
- Very-

215
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,499
No. I was about to
tell one more bad joke.

216
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,832
Here's where we are.

217
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,915
And there's where we're headed

218
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,874
Sorry

219
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,665
Why do people smoke?

220
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,874
You don't know. Oh come on Rhea.

221
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,874
Unless you try how will
you know? it's amazing

222
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,415
You are right.

223
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,790
Why do people smoke?

224
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,249
Can I have some gum?

225
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,249
Only one.
- Can I have one more?

226
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,790
"I and you.."

227
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,332
I thought we're
taking this tour together

228
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,082
So? - Why do you guys
always walk ahead of girls?

229
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,999
Why are girls always a step behind?

230
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:16,915
We walk ahead to show you the way

231
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,999
and we follow so we can support you

232
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,624
Okay that is quiet sad.

233
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,374
"I and you.."

234
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,999
Museum!
- Oh no Rhea.

235
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,040
We decided not to see boring museums.

236
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,124
Excuse me- When did we decide?

237
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,165
Okay we're deciding now.

238
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,582
Oh come Rhea don't be such a girl.

239
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,957
Museums are for kids
school teachers and old people.

240
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,540
Okay I am going. You are on your own.

241
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,499
You'll leave me all alone?

242
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,082
You will leave a girl
all alone in Amsterdam?

243
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,165
How will I get to
the airport on my own?

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,665
Fine.
- Fine. - Fine.

245
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:11,082
You go your way. I'll go mine.

246
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,415
it is an art dear. it is good-

247
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,249
Done with your museum?

248
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,832
Now let's do something.. Fun.

249
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,457
God
- What have I done?

250
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,374
Why were you staring at that girl?

251
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:48,165
Your x-ray eyes see through dresses?
- I wish

252
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,207
What? Rhea man..

253
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,707
Karan how would you feel if
you were ogled at by a girl?

254
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,874
Wait don't even bother to answer me-

255
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,582
Thank God not all guys think like you

256
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:11,540
Okay what? Rhea.. Not all guys think
like that? You seriously think so?

257
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,790
You mean every guy is looking
for the same thing from a girl?

258
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,124
Right.

259
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,957
And what if he doesn't get it?
- We cover up with lies

260
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,499
Lies?

261
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,915
So what's your lie?

262
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,165
Your lies

263
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,790
When a girl smiles at me..

264
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:42,415
I tell my friends look she
gave me her telephone number

265
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,707
When she gives me her
telephone number

266
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,749
I'll tell that I took her out

267
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:51,207
When I take her out
I'll say that I held her hand

268
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,707
When she holds my hand I'll say..

269
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,082
I kissed her

270
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,457
After I've kissed her I'll say..

271
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,332
We've done something. You know what.

272
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,082
And talking about us what
lies will you tell your friends?

273
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:12,082
I didn't mean you. I meant.-
- You guys are sick-

274
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,790
You guys are sick!
- But I didn't mean you-

275
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,790
Why does she take
everything so seriously?

276
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:26,874
You'll never figure why..?

277
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:52,082
She thinks harder
but she knows lesser

278
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:57,082
Whatever her heart tells
she'll do quite something else

279
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:07,624
I'll never figure why
she isn't like a guy

280
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:18,499
She thinks harder but she knows lesser

281
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:22,999
Whatever her heart tells
she'll do quite something else

282
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:33,915
I'll never figure why
she isn't like a guy

283
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,999
There's romance lurking in her heart
but she wants you to make a start

284
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,832
And when she's ratted

285
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,290
it's her locks that she ruffled"

286
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:55,832
I mean you're all the same

287
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,957
We're nice friends I
never thought of you that way

288
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,874
Sounds fine but it
never came to my mind

289
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,957
Up close she says you're so special

290
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:12,124
and soon nothing
about you is good enough"

291
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,707
What an awful shirt What a haircut

292
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,499
Stop speeding

293
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,957
Stop hogging

294
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,249
Give me a break

295
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:24,832
Up close she wants to change your life

296
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,957
the spell she casts
can ruin your life"

297
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:34,832
You'll fall for her
words then you'll know why..

298
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:39,874
what started with a
laugh ends in a cry

299
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:51,040
And you'll never figure
why she's so unlike a guy

300
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:26,290
if happiness is being alone
what makes you such a flirt?

301
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:31,624
The thousand gifts you shower on
her for what were all those flowers?

302
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:34,124
You didn't tell me your name

303
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,540
How about a coffee?

304
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,207
Can I drop you home?

305
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,207
When do I get to see you next?

306
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:44,165
it's a wayward life you've
lived living like a tramp

307
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:49,457
But you'll insist you're
different why are you so vain?

308
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,582
That wet towel on the floor

309
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,415
Cap of the toothpaste tube missing

310
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,374
Wear used socks inside out

311
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,290
Never knows how time flies?

312
00:22:57,583 --> 00:23:02,249
How to live a life she shows you

313
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:07,415
She makes something human out of you

314
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,415
Not one moment can
you live without her

315
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,165
And she knows what you can't tell her

316
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:28,165
That's just why no
girl’s are like a guy

317
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:38,249
All sorts of strange dates
she'll always call to mind

318
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:43,499
Love can be forgotten but
forgetting a date is crime

319
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:47,582
On 1st March we looked at each
other. 4th April I went to meet you

320
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,790
May 21 . You touched me

321
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,790
June 6. I felt something stirring

322
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:56,290
Can't trust a guy
these guys are so fast

323
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:01,457
Now he's here now he's gone
no telling how long he'll last

324
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:05,165
Your Mummy-Daddy aren't at home?
Great! Can I come over?

325
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:08,790
Your friend is going home alone.
Poor thing shall I escort her?

326
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:14,457
She'll lead you up the
street before she says yes

327
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:19,665
She's enjoying herself
while you're getting harassed

328
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:25,207
She's shy that's why she hides.."

329
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:29,624
But if she said yes ever
she's is avowed forever

330
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:45,165
That's just why a
girl’s different from a guy

331
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:50,915
That's just why a girl's different
from a guy - Someone shut her up

332
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,832
All right what's the quarrel?

333
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,582
Like a bee he comes singing his song

334
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,457
then he's busy I got the
timing wrong" - Oh come on Rhea

335
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,790
Please I'm busy or I'd never..

336
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:04,624
So what you'll live
in my heart forever

337
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,999
The beauty he fell for once is now so
boring..- I am not listening to you.

338
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,624
and before you know it his..

339
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,040
..eyes have begun philandering
- I am not listening to you.

340
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,582
You can't live on love and fresh air.

341
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,957
Why not take up interior decoration?

342
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,165
Okay that's it.

343
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,999
"I and you.."

344
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:57,332
Rhea hey wait up dear-

345
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:03,707
Rhea come on stop. Look.-

346
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:08,582
..I kissed you. You
slapped me. Scores settled?

347
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,707
Come on dear.

348
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,415
Now you're going to listen

349
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,665
I thought you're a nice guy only a
little stupid but a respected guy.

350
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:21,582
And you got me all wrong

351
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:25,124
Because it was I who
broke the ice on the plane?

352
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,915
I went out with you in Amsterdam
tried puffing a cigarette..

353
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,624
you thought I was
all laid out for you?

354
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,915
How true. Guys like you expect
only one thing from any girl

355
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,249
You are sick. You have
no respect for woman.

356
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,665
Such strange notions

357
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,457
You wanted to know?

358
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:46,915
How our story ends?
There's no story about us

359
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,999
There's only "The
End" and this is the end

360
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,874
Understand and good bye.

361
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:56,665
No bye's Rhea-

362
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,082
Life's a long while

363
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,499
You and I.. unlike other
guys and girls we won't fight

364
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,374
Okay cool.
- I like that.

365
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:28,457
Stop whistling- it's not nice

366
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,499
I'm not whistling at a girl

367
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,624
You go whistling after girls?

368
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:35,415
Gosh you are sick-

369
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:40,624
You go whistling at
girls and you say I'm sick?

370
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:46,832
I never whistled at anyone and
I didn't say I wouldn't fight

371
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,707
You girls are totally
confused silly girls.

372
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,749
No point telling the truth to girls
- Meaning?

373
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,540
For example in that
dress you don't look fat

374
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:59,165
What? I look fat in this dress?

375
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,040
I don't look fat for the dress.

376
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,999
it's the pink. Pink makes me look fat

377
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,749
Neither you nor your
dress is to blame.

378
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:10,957
Pink takes the blame.

379
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:12,915
Oh God.

380
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,874
I'm serious. I look slim in blue

381
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,332
I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

382
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,249
Where am I going.. hot dog

383
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:57,582
Hot dog? One for me.
- Okay

384
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,624
I knew! it's.- you

385
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,332
I knew too. I'm avoiding you

386
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,999
Avoid? What do you mean avoid?

387
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,790
You're still angry? Rhea I was only..

388
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:28,915
You transpired. it's bound to happen-
- Forget it. Now we meet..

389
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:33,332
After 6 months in New York.
Like I told you..

390
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:37,040
between us there's a story.
- And what about your other story?

391
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,957
Which story?
- The one behind the tree.-

392
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:42,332
in which you were doing whatever..
- Who me..?

393
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:45,332

397
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,457
Rhea have you met my boyfriend?

Karan is your boyfriend?
- Yes- Ever since college. in Delhi

399
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:04,124
Rhea and I were classmates in school.

400
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,999
Your friend from school? That's nice

401
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:10,374
We never saw each other
after we went to college

402
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,999
How do you know each other?

403
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,540
Karan. He's your boyfriend

404
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,665
Rhea is your friend from school

405
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:25,040
if one of you doesn't
tell me How you met up

406
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,874
No baby no
- I'll scream- Right now

407
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,957
Excuse me
- Come darling I'll tell you

408
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:35,040
When we met in Amsterdam.-
Shalini was still your girlfriend?

409
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,040
You went to Amsterdam?
- I.. I..

410
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,874
Come I'll tell you everything

411
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,207
Wait a minute wait a minute.

412
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:48,082
Shalini I'll tell you
how we met up in Amsterdam

413
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:52,540
I've got some work. I'll see you.
- What work..? Karan!

414
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,124
I'll tell you when I remember
- Come here

415
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,707
He's a real jerk. I swear! He
actually kissed me. I slapped him

416
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:05,040
What?
- He is there.

417
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,582
Look dear I am sorry.
I hardly met this girl-

418
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,207
Listen!

419
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,707
Thanks.

420
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,457
Somebody has told it right that..

421
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,999
..behind every
successful man there's a woman

422
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,332
Of course

423
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,790
That's because girls never run
after guys who don't succeed

424
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:26,707
You must rig the tent in four days

425
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:30,832
Mr. Mishra we've organized
so many weddings together..

426
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:34,707
I've given you so much business.
And today on the right time..

427
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:38,040
no you must do something. Please

428
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,832
Assurances and assurances-
Nothing ever seems to happen

429
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:46,832
Why are you staring at me?
Get on with your jobs

430
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:51,040
Good morning mom.

431
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,957
Nothing for breakfast?

432
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,874
I only got to ask for
breakfast and you break into tears?

433
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,707
The tent isn't up- Mr.
Sharma's wife is in labour

434
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:08,540
And even that cow is sick!!!
Why haven't you taken a haircut?

435
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,874
This is my Tom Cruise look
- Tom Cruise look!

436
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:19,082
I told you stop organising weddings.
- Karan please leave me alone

437
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,457
Ok I'll make myself breakfast.
You want anything?

438
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:28,624
Karan what are you doing next week?
- Next week?

439
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:33,999
I don't know about today and
you ask me about a week ahead

440
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,582
I've never planned so long ahead

441
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,749
Wait a minute. Why?

442
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:45,415
Because you're going to
help me out with this wedding

443
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,249
Oh come on mom. Am I
supposed to organise weddings?

444
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,415
- I'm not asking- I'm ordering you.
Do you understand? That's it-

445
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:55,249
No way! I can't do all this
I won't get into all this

446
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,249
I am sorry but the answer is No.

447
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:08,540
Sahib what goes in between?
white flowers? Greens or marigolds?

448
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:12,249
What do you feel?
- Marigolds could be better

449
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:16,374
I used marigolds for my wedding.
- Then go ahead why ask me?

450
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:22,290
Oye! - Not Oye. My name is
Jhallo Ram. - Take your basket away

451
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,124
Hello! Susie don't believe Natasha

452
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,374
She and I are just friends.
Nothing happened between us

453
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,707
I don't care. I just called to say
that boss has cancelled your leave

454
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:46,707
if you don't report for
work today you're fired

455
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,040
Let him do that

456
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:51,207
He was very serious
- Even I'm very serious

457
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,124
The Times of India
has made me an offer-

458
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,457
They'll carry my
Hum-Tum cartoons daily

459
00:34:55,958 --> 00:35:00,415
And the money is good. So who
cares for this nine-to-fiver?

460
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:02,957
Right Tuka Ram?
- No. Jhallo Ram

461
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,749
The bride's people have arrived

462
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,624
Susie the bride's people have arrived

463
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,290
Suji.. the stuff for
making sweets? (Suji: semolina)

464
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,749
Jhallo Ram- Unload the stuff

465
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:20,707
Where is the electricity generator?
Nothing's on time if I'm not around

466
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,415
This is nice.

467
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:27,124
Remove that basket

468
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,165
Nice venue for a wedding

469
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,415
Thank you very much.

470
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:36,540
A wedding villa is a fun place-
How far away is your bridegroom?

471
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:43,332
Hum-Tum! I always browse the
strip in the Sunday Times of India

472
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,790
Hey that's cool.

473
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:52,915
My Hum-Tum is so popular among girls?
- Yours? Hum-Tum are very cute

474
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,332
Right. You and I are cute

475
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,082
Hi I am Pooja.

476
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,415
Hi Karan.

477
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,207
Karan Kapoor?
- That's right.

478
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,249
No way. Rhea.

479
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,290
Hey well done dear-

480
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,832
You are looking like a girl.
- Don't touch me.

481
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,165
Damn tent. Oh Jesus.

482
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:24,749
Something awful always
happens whenever I see you

483
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:31,415
Whatever happened to your hair?
- it's my Tom Cruise look

484
00:36:31,916 --> 00:36:35,040
You won't understand. Not
your level- This is fashion

485
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,249
What? - You loser!

486
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,790
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

487
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,082
I'm in charge of wedding plans here

488
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:49,832
That's obvious.
- Actually it's my Ma- I'm helping her

489
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,582
That's so sweet.
- Right? See so sweet

490
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:58,082
What are you doing here?
- You're organising the wedding?

491
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:02,415
And you don't know who the bride is?
- Who..?

492
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,624
No way you.

493
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,415
You're marrying so late?

494
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:11,915
You could've mothered
three kids by now. Have you?

495
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,915
Come on tell me how many.
- You are really a loser Karan.

496
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:19,249
3 years on I thought my
slap would’ve mended your mind

497
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,832
I guess I was wrong-

498
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,832
Some guys never change

499
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,249
My bags are inside the car.
Have them delivered to my room

500
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,957
You think I'm a porter?
- Likewise

501
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,207
Bye Karan-

502
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:34,582
I hate that chick-

503
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:45,165
What's up?
- How many kilos of candies?

504
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:50,040
Who wants candies?
I hate them. Who asked for it?

505
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,832
The bride's mother.
- Who chooses sweets for the wedding?

506
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:55,374
The bride's mother? Or I..?
- You're the boss

507
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,915
Get ten kilos of pastries-
- Done

508
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,249
Greetings.
- Greetings

509
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:08,124
I'm the bride's mother. Sorry
you should've said you hate candies

510
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,540
I'd never have asked for those

511
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:10,874
Aunty I was only..

512
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,999
Aunty? How can you call me aunty?

513
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,374
Jhallo Ram where are you going?
- To buy your pastries

514
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:20,499
I was just joking. What did
the bride's mother ask for?

515
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,415
Candies.
- Then candy it is

516
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:25,249
Buy 10 kilos. No 15 kilos

517
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,540
5 kilos from my side

518
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:28,082
Many thanks

519
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:30,249
You're Anju's son?
- Yes Aunty

520
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,957
What's this cursed Aunty-Aunty?

521
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:36,332
in our times we married
early we had our babies fast

522
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,249
if you insist..

523
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,249
..you can add a Bobby with Aunty.

524
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:43,165
The name's Mrs. Parminder Prakash

525
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,749
But everyone calls me
Bobby Aunty- it is my pet name

526
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,249
if I may say so

527
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,082
you're as beautiful as the
legendary danseuse Umrao Jaan

528
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:56,249
I've been noticing you all along.
Your poise your grace..

529
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,749
today's girls have none of it.
Now take your daughter

530
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,332
Son.. even I've been
noticing you all day

531
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:08,957
striding like a tiger.. showing off
your stripes to the girls.- Not I.-

532
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,040
Come off it. Wish you good luck

533
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,790
Please..
- Karan..

534
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,624
Yes Bobby Aunty..?
- Shut up

535
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:18,082
I think this shut up
problem is from their ancestors.

536
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,707
Hey hi Priya.
- Hi.

537
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,415
Not Priya. Pooja

538
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,332
I think Priya suits you more.
- No

539
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,165
Can I call you Priya?
- No.

540
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,415
Thank you.

541
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:36,790
Jhaloram. Hey Jhalo.. tell any
of your friend to get me a car.

542
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,082
Your friends and family
just hijacked all the cars

543
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,540
And my designer wants me to
try out my wedding gown right now

544
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:44,957
Get me a cab

545
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,082
Here's a village.

546
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:50,249
You won't spot a cab
in a 12 mile radius

547
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:56,124
Well! There's a way

548
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,582
Why aren't you attending the ritual?

549
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,540
You aren't supposed to meet your
fiancé two days before the wedding

550
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,915
Obviously you don't know.

551
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,832
is it an arranged match? Or love?

552
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,457
What do you think?
- I don't know arranged?

553
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,874
Oh love.
- No both.

554
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,957
What do you mean by both?

555
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,165
Sameer and I went to college together

556
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,624
We became good friends.

557
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,290
He proposed.

558
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:35,415
I said okay.
- Just like that you said okay-

559
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,707
He's smart sensitive successful
mature..

560
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:43,707
unlike you- Find-my-towel-type.
- What's find-my-towel-type?

561
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,999
Like someone who'd
scream from the bathroom..

562
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:50,040
Where's my towel my shoes.-
where's the newspaper?

563
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:52,415
Just peas and potatoes?

564
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,832
in short find-my-towel-type.

565
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:56,915
You expect your Sameer..

566
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,832
..won't ask you to find
his towel after the wedding?

567
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:03,082
Oh you poor thing.

568
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:09,582
in New York you lived with Sameer?
- Before my wedding? Are you mad?

569
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,957
Oh come on Rhea..

570
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,332
Don't tell me you never..?
- What..?

571
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,915
You know what I mean ding dong?

572
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,832
Why should I tell you that?

573
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:22,540
That means no.
I knew it no ding dong.

574
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,874
You don't know anything ding dong?

575
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:31,165
Rhea this looks fantastic on you.
- Thanks Mailni..

576
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,999
..but don't you think it should be
slightly more fitted here.

577
00:41:33,083 --> 00:41:34,790
Just a little from here perfect.

578
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:38,832
Rhea Pooja said your
Sameer is some computer engineer

579
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,374
Sounds quite serious and quite boring

580
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,957
Being a computer engineer
doesn't make him serious and boring

581
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,124
Unlike you he isn't an immature fool

582
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,624
Had I been more mature
you would've considered me..?

583
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,207
Shut up Karan- I'm getting
married in two days. You're sick

584
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:04,290
Did I ask you to marry me? She
takes everything so seriously

585
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:06,874
Hello.
- Hi.

586
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:10,915
I don't see your husband.
He's in the catering business?

587
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,790
You're in the weddings' business
he's in the catering business..?

588
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,624
Wonderful! Wish you good luck.
- No he's a photographer

589
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,540
Even better! He's going to
shoot the wedding photos?

590
00:42:20,791 --> 00:42:24,290
No he's a fashion photographer.
Besides he doesn't live in India

591
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:28,624
in fact we've separated.
- So what?

592
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,707
I've separated from my husband too.
it was a matter of life and death

593
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:40,332
Bobby you're a
wonderful example of perseverance

594
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:44,540
Somewhat true- But Anju
you've got it going for you

595
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:46,707
You run a thriving wedding business.

596
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:47,999
And all you have is one son

597
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,374
You haven't a worry in life

598
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:53,165
Of course I worry. Mention
marriage and Karan runs scared

599
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,624
Oh! Why..?

600
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,707
Marriage is the end
of love and romance

601
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,332
Taking a potshot at marriage? Does
he know what love and romance is?

602
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:04,415
What would she know?
She's getting hitched

603
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:07,290
You tell me did Adam and Eve marry?
- No..

604
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:11,374
They didn't and they
basked in their un-marital bliss

605
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,332
Look at legends. Romeo
and Juliet- Did they marry?

606
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:17,582
No.
- They didn't

607
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,415
Did Heer marry Ranjha?
- No

608
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:22,124
Did Shirin and Farhad marry?
- No

609
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,207
Ever wondered why?
- Why..?

610
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,499
I'll tell you why.

611
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:28,957
Marriage would’ve
spelled doom for their romance

612
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,999
They could never have
become legendary lovers

613
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:35,415
So I tell you if you wish
to find true love never marry

614
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,040
Fall in love like me

615
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,874
What rubbish Nonsense

616
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:45,249
Yet every romantic legend
stopped short of a wedding? How come?

617
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,624
You ever heard a story told about
the romance of any married couple?

618
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,332
Of course. And
everyone in the world knows

619
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,707
Emperor Shah Jahan
gave his wife Mumtaz..

620
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:01,165
..the finest tribute
to love. Taj Mahal

621
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:27,499
Chocolate heroes

622
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,124
They're screaming for love..

623
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,915
these roadside romeos.-

624
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:40,874
They're screaming for love..

625
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:45,415
these roadside romeos.-

626
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,249
but they'll duck the wedding

627
00:44:52,375 --> 00:45:08,790
Chocolate heroes

628
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,124
Deep down inside whatever he is..

629
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,749
he'll put up a heroic posture

630
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:41,165
All day he's ogling books..

631
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,374
full of girlie posters

632
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:48,540
He'll say life's a carnival.-

633
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,999
but marriage is trouble

634
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,415
So show him the door

635
00:45:56,875 --> 00:46:20,374
Chocolate hero

636
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:25,040
Chocolate heroes

637
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:28,582
Talk of marrying..

638
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:33,374
and he throws a fit
- Really?

639
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,915
Talk of living-in.-

640
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:42,790
you'll find he swears by it

641
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,707
in every girl he finds romance

642
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:48,082
But commitment not a chance

643
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:53,707
He'll never find Juliet
so Romeo loses his shirt

644
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:56,040
Chocolate heroes

645
00:46:56,125 --> 00:47:05,582
Chocolate hero

646
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:10,040
Chocolate heroes

647
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,457
He'll grow up to
become an ageing beast..

648
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,499
and the coughing will
rack his ancient chest..

649
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,999
he won't find a helping hand..

650
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,707
then he'll miss love’s caring wand

651
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:54,749
When he is abandoned
then he will repent

652
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:59,832
And then finally he will remember me

653
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:04,707
Chocolate hero

654
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:07,749
Chocolate heroes

655
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:12,207
They're screaming for love..

656
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,874
these roadside romeos.-

657
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:23,874
but they'll duck the wedding

658
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:35,832
Chocolate hero

659
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:40,457
Chocolate heroes

660
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:58,374
The bridegroom has come.

661
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,707
What's all this excitement over?
fetching the bridegroom?

662
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,124
He's bound to turn up isn't he?
if he fails to turn up.-

663
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:06,124
then you've reason for excitement..
the bridegroom is missing..

664
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:39,790
Come on Rhea come on.

665
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:43,499
What a naughty boy

666
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,165
Where ends our story?

667
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,290
Story? Ours?
- Yes

668
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:14,624
A story is happening around every one.

669
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:19,207
When we meet others our stories meet"

670
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,124
There's no story about us.

671
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,290
There's only The End.
The end. This is the end-

672
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,124
Bye
- Bye-

673
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,290
I wish Mamma was here

674
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:26,999
You know she's busy at home.
if she could’ve come she would

675
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,207
Carrying prayer candles

676
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,624
What.-?- Always
transpires with prayer candles

677
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:39,374
Mamma? Mamma! Mamma I
thought you wouldn’t make it

678
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,624
Yes dear-

679
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,540
Actually I was totally stuck.

680
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:49,374
I thought I'd miss your flight.
But Karan took care of everything

681
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:52,457
He is a very helpful boy dear-
- Karan?

682
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,832
Friend's colony? I
live in Friends Colony too

683
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:03,082
is it? Which block?
- 'M' I am in K 42

684
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:06,374
Sorry I lied. Actually
I live in Kailash Colony

685
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,499
But now that we've
met Let's meet up more

686
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,665
Yes sure-
- Nice meeting you. - Yes- - Bye-

687
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:16,915
K 42 in friends colony. Yes.

688
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,082
No use

689
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:24,374
No use. You'll end up taking her out

690
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,249
You'll spend money take
her for a long drive..

691
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:27,707
..and when you're dropping her home-

692
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,165
you'll hope she asks you in for coffee

693
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,707
She won't

694
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,874
How can you say?

695
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:46,040
Even I did my bit- But don't worry

696
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,040
my success rate wasn't hundred percent

697
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,499
Many a times I was
left thirsting for coffee

698
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:56,374
What happened? You think
I don't think like you?

699
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,957
For you as many girls as you wish?

700
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,624
For me only one for a whole lifetime?

701
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:08,040
Don't worry Rhea
didn't make a wrong decision

702
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,874
No boring scenes as
in when I suddenly..

703
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,582
..realise that
you're in love with Rhea

704
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:16,915
No!
- Even if he does too bad

705
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:23,332
We need women more than they need us

706
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,707
And somewhere inside all of us guys ..

707
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:28,374
..there's a kid who refuses to grow up

708
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,999
No matter.- how
feeble she might seem.-

709
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:40,124
..but in here we're far weaker.-

710
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,999
But you won't understand now

711
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:50,582
The day you find
your Rhea you'll know..

712
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,332
Take care.
- Bye bye.

713
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:41,957
You always appear just when
I've forgotten all about you

714
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,040
Which means you think of me
all the time when I'm away

715
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,540
I never meant that

716
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:52,457
if you wish never to see me again.-

717
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,415
you must think of me always

718
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:58,499
Because when you've
forgotten all about me..

719
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:02,457
I'll make my appearance
- Yes

720
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:08,290
But if you're thinking of me always
you're actually wishing you'd see me

721
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,624
Right? Yes.. no.-

722
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:16,165
That's why a boy and a girl
can never be friends- Why?

723
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:21,415
Because you girls always
end up talking about love

724
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:25,749
Then you and I will never be friends

725
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:29,665
Too bad.
- Too bad. - Bye. - Bye.

726
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:04,374
Dad will you ever be on time..?

727
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,415
Excuse me madam- - Yes please- -
Can I get a beer? - Yes sure.

728
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:17,332
And one Cognac-

729
00:56:26,791 --> 00:56:35,540
I'm no poet

730
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:40,624
But my pretty one..

731
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:44,999
..ever since I've seen you..

732
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:49,874
poetry just dawned upon me

733
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:55,707
I'm no poet

734
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,290
He is my son. Cheers-

735
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:10,207
I had heard of love no doubt

736
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:15,082
But I didn't know what love was

737
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:20,082
I remained confused as
confusions generally are..

738
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:25,124
and remained an enemy among friends

739
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,832
Yet I'm no foe..

740
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:34,624
..but dear pretty one..

741
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:38,707
..having seen you.-

742
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:43,915
I've learnt to make friends

743
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:49,249
And I was no poet

744
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,915
Hi dad-
- My dear son. - Thank you.

745
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:00,457
Wow!
- is it good or bad?

746
00:58:00,916 --> 00:58:03,707
Dad it is in the front
cover of Vogue. Mind blowing.

747
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,374
Your Dad isn't an international
photographer for nothing

748
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,707
I am so proud of you dad.
- Thank you.

749
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,124
Could I find her phone number?

750
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:19,540
Now Paris? Aren't you tired of
shifting base every year or two?

751
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,040
What's tiring about it?

752
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:26,332
in the last eight years I've
done New York Milan and now Paris

753
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,832
Who are you running from?
- Your mother

754
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,124
Okay done dear-

755
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,707
I won't talk ill of your
mother in front of you

756
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,999
Dad! Not even behind my back

757
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:39,707
A man has a right to
live his life no?

758
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,915
if not my wife whom do I criticize.-

759
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,582
..my neighbour's wife?

760
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:47,165
Even after all these
years of living apart?

761
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,124
You still consider her your wife?

762
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,082
There is something.

763
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,332
I don't know but I love Bombay.

764
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:58,082
Mom was upset when
we shifted from Delhi.

765
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,999
She's settled down.

766
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:04,165
Hey nice house dad-

767
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,040
Your room is over there-
- Thanks

768
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,374
Wow amazing dad-

769
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:18,624
Nice pictures dad-

770
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,082
Nice pictures.
- Relax boy relax.

771
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,290
Part of my last
year's photo exhibition

772
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:24,624
That is why they are there.

773
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:26,665
Snacks?
- Yes please

774
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,874
Your wife is fine Dad-

775
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:33,874
Did I ask how she is?

776
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,832
Not in many words.

777
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,332
Good day mister- Coffee or tea?

778
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:50,874
How are you?

779
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:53,999
Nothing thank you.

780
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,999
Good day madam. Coffee or tea?
- Coffee.

781
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,165
Milk very little just
about two spoons. Sugar.-

782
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,540
..brown sugar. That's it.

783
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,082
Like I said life's a
long while. We keep meeting

784
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,415
Karan.
- Hi.

785
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,707
I am sorry madam.

786
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:32,582
That was bound to happen

787
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:35,040
Oh come on how can you forget?

788
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,499
Every time we meet
something always goes wrong

789
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,665
You haven't changed a bit

790
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:44,832
What are you doing in Paris?
- I run a little boutique here

791
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,457
Nice.
- What are you doing here?

792
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,040
I'm pursuing love between" You and I"

793
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:55,290
Remember my cartoon
characters Hum-Tum?

794
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:59,707
You won't believe it the whole
country is raving about Hum-Tum

795
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:03,707
I mean from like newspaper clippings
T-shirts caps no words dear.

796
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:06,124
I mean it is really very successful.

797
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,457
Very good-
- Thank you.

798
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:12,665
Publishers wanted me to write
a novel about Hum-Tum.. in which..

799
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,540
they fall in love-

800
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:17,290
Because Paris is the most
romantic city in the world..

801
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:19,707
here I am catalysing their romance.

802
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,915
And it's so awful you're walking out?

803
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:26,999
No it's my station. All the
best for your Hum-Tum Bye.

804
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,582
Hey Riya! Say hi to Sameer.

805
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,832
Sameer is no longer part of my life

806
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,999
I just want to talk to her.

807
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:24,165
Have your food is
it to eat or to see?

808
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:27,874
Should I call her up Dad?
- Certainly not

809
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,249
Wait till the next summer

810
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:32,540
I want to talk to her-

811
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,749
I want to know what happened to her

812
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,790
I just want to make her feel better-

813
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:38,832
She isn't the same old Rhea

814
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,374
But I haven't left a good impression

815
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,332
Hope she doesn't get me wrong

816
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:47,915
if you wish to do good
do it. Don't hesitate

817
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,624
Take my mobile and call up.

818
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:53,624
if you keep mulling over it
you'll end up nowhere? Now be a man.

819
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:57,457
You keep thinking just do it.

820
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:03,624
Who will eat that food? Your Dad?
Not a bad idea who wants to diet?

821
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:11,707
Hello Can I speak to Rhea?

822
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:17,874
Who's calling? I'm
hearing Hindi after ages

823
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,124
By the way who are you?

824
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,082
Umrao Jaan is that you?
- Umrao Jaan?

825
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:28,957
Aunty I'm Karan- Karan Kapoor-
Mrs. Kapoor's son

826
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:33,082
is that you Tiger?
Where are you calling from?

827
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:36,374
I'm calling from Paris.
You needn't raise your voice

828
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:40,415
Shut up I'm tired of
talking in hushed tones

829
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:43,374
Blast their diction they always
seem to be conspiring in whispers

830
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:46,332
if you're in Paris aren't
you coming over to see us?

831
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:49,582
Give me your address and
I'll be over in a flash

832
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:52,874
Address? You know
how these names sound

833
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:56,790
.. I went to school till 8th standard

834
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:57,999
Yes I can manage English

835
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,290
But it is not like that.

836
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,874
but this language..
never heard anything like it

837
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:06,499
French.. never speak what they write.
More like they are gargling.

838
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:08,749
Aunty address.

839
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:13,290
I'll give it a try. Write.

840
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,707
Apartment
- Red brick building..

841
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:27,624
it's a red building on the street.
I can't manage the name of the house

842
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:32,165
Made of olden type red bricks

843
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:44,749
Sometimes in life some things
happen and you lose faith in God

844
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:48,999
Did Sameer and Rhea hurt anyone?

845
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,957
Just after their first anniversary..

846
01:04:57,291 --> 01:05:00,790
..like everyday Sameer
was leaving for work

847
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:05,874
Some college students jumped a
traffic signal for the fun of it

848
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:11,874
And in a moment's time
Rhea's life changed forever

849
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:19,415
There was a time when she lit up
my life whenever she came home

850
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,790
Nowadays she's so quiet.-

851
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:27,749
Sometimes I don't realize
that we are in the same room.

852
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:35,165
She left America
India.. and now she's here..

853
01:05:36,416 --> 01:05:39,790
where she knows that no one knows her

854
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:44,207
I think she wants to
get lost in the crowd

855
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:53,790
Now it's as if Rhea has lost herself

856
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,999
My Rhea lived life on her own terms;

857
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,582
in life’s hands she
suffers her defeat

858
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:21,665
Just met your mother

859
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:26,499
Can I share your umbrella? Thanks.

860
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:41,665
You know Rhea..

861
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,915
Sometimes whatever happens to us.-

862
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,749
God what am I saying.-?

863
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,624
Whatever I say what use..

864
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:18,374
You're home

865
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:24,040
And you couldn’t even say
how you liked the conversation

866
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:33,415
Thank you Karan
- What for?

867
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:38,874
For what you've been
trying to say Bye-

868
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:45,499
Hey Rhea can I borrow your umbrella?

869
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,915
Oh sure-

870
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:50,749
Thanks bye.

871
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:15,207
"You looked at me and gifted me.."

872
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:17,749
Mamma phone.

873
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:23,582
Hello. - Hello could I

874
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:27,165
One minute.. your phone.

875
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:29,082
Who is it?
- No idea

876
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,749
Hello!
- This is such a problem.

877
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,165
I grasp Neither the
language nor the cuisine

878
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,249
I end up eating what I never ordered.

879
01:08:38,708 --> 01:08:41,332
Listen have lunch with me tomorrow-

880
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:45,582
And I get to return your umbrella

881
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,749
No Karan. Not lunch.
I'm busy tomorrow

882
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:53,415
Are you sure.
- Yes-

883
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,749
Anyway thanks bye.

884
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,707
He only asked you out for lunch

885
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:08,415
You could've said dinner

886
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:12,040
All day you sit at home.
You could do with an outing

887
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,457
What a life. Home-to-boutique-to-home

888
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:17,082
Mamma.
- What am I saying?

889
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:21,540
I'm only watching my
movie 'Teesri Manzil.'

890
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:24,832
Shammi Kapoor is a star

891
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,749
My darling baby

892
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,999
What do you think about this?

893
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:34,874
it is good.
- it is very soft..

894
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:37,290
..and this color
looks very nice on you.

895
01:09:38,875 --> 01:09:39,957
it is so soft.

896
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,790
Finding that Chinese
restaurant was tough. - Karan.

897
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:46,040
You said you'd be busy.

898
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:48,665
So I thought let’s have lunch here

899
01:09:48,916 --> 01:09:51,124
Would you like to join us?
- No thanks I will have it later-

900
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,124
I want this.
- You want to take this?

901
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:57,457
Come on I am famished

902
01:09:58,041 --> 01:10:00,165
You want to eat this?
- Why are you doing this Karan?

903
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:07,290
Why this expression of sympathy?

904
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,207
This is the reason

905
01:10:09,541 --> 01:10:11,707
why I didn't return to
India after Sameer died

906
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,457
I hate seeing people pitying me

907
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:17,665
Why can't you people
be just normal with me?

908
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:22,832
The food bill. 32 Euros

909
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:28,332
Your share is 16 Euros-
Remember? You only said fifty-fifty

910
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:38,207
Can we eat? I'm really hungry

911
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:47,082
Lovely food

912
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,874
How did you find out I like Chinese?

913
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:53,249
I never knew- I love Chinese

914
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,124
Come on start eating.

915
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:59,874
Excuse me- Oh I am sorry I didn't
know you were closed for lunch-

916
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:01,374
No no it is fine-
Come I'll help you.

917
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:04,415
Eat in peace. Let me take care of her

918
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,832
Hi I am Karan-
- Hi I am Nicole.

919
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,874
Hey nice doggy.
- Thank you.

920
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:14,665
I want an overcoat.
- Okay what type?

921
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:28,082
Pretty child.
- Thank you

922
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:33,999
Something about me?
- I only said she's a pretty child

923
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:40,999
Not bad. You picked up French so fast?

924
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,874
Must know the language where you live

925
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:49,457
I seem to be able to make do
with Hindi anywhere in the world

926
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:53,207
if they don't know Hindi I
make sure I teach them some

927
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:54,832
Hey look at them.

928
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,999
if I don't teach Hindi
to those French kids..

929
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:06,040
..you can change my name to
something French All right.

930
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:12,915
But if I succeed you'll do as I say.
- Do what..?

931
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:27,124

932
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:33,915

Chuck it I am with you-

What are you doing? My bags..

979
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:54,249
I don't run a hotel.

980
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,415
if you're living with me
you'll socialize with me

981
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:58,749
if you're seeing only
Rhea find someplace else

982
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:01,999
Get lost don't stay with me. Out!
Dare don't stay with me!

983
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:10,332
Dad- These dramatics
don't suit you. Open the door

984
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,499
Spending so much time with a
girl doesn't suit you either

985
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:15,832
By the way is it serious?

986
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:20,624
What an awkward monologue with a door.

987
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,874
Please open the door.

988
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,540
On one condition.
You'll introduce e to Rhea

989
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:27,082
Rhea has invited us to lunch tomorrow-

990
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:31,499
Really? Come in.
- But.. - Come in-

991
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,332
The door was open?
- Then what?

992
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:41,124
You think I'm a bad dad who'll
lock his son out in the cold?

993
01:17:41,416 --> 01:17:42,707
No I am not so bad.

994
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,790
I'm a bad boy

995
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,332
Excuse me..

996
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,082
is Karan in?

997
01:17:53,958 --> 01:17:59,832
I am Arjun Kapoor- Good day.
- Good day. I'm Nicole

998
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,957
Nicole-
- Welcome

999
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:10,415
Greetings. - Greetings. - My father.
- Greetings uncle.

1000
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:16,415
So you are Karan's "bau'ji"..
- "Bau'ji"..? - Dad?

1001
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:21,207
Myself Mrs. Parminder Prakash.
You can call me Bobby

1002
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:24,290
I'd rather call you Dimple
the actress who played Bobby

1003
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:30,082
Your Bau'ji is very colourful Karan.
- Dad..

1004
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:36,332
Flowers for my Umrao Jaan.
- Lovely flowers. Nice boy

1005
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,540
I wish I had carried those flowers

1006
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,707
Oh chocolates for you.
- Thank you.

1007
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:46,165
Please come in
- Do come inside

1008
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,165
Nice house.
- Thank you

1009
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:49,999
So you've taken after your father

1010
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:57,124
Son..

1011
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,207
I want to see Rhea married again

1012
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,499
You ought to talk to my mother

1013
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:07,290
She organizes weddings

1014
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:10,582
Silly I didn't mean that

1015
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:17,915
You aren't talking about me..?
- I love my daughter dearly

1016
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,082
Would I ever want her to
marry someone like you?

1017
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,332
Thank God. I was scared

1018
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:29,332
Life is meant to be lived..
to the fullest

1019
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:36,749
I know what loneliness means

1020
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,124
At least I had Rhea

1021
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:43,499
After I'm gone who stays with Rhea?

1022
01:19:45,583 --> 01:19:48,082
Everyone of us needs someone..

1023
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:54,707
For company love support

1024
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:00,874
But I have a feeling That
Rhea will refuse to agree

1025
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:04,207
That's why she is living here.
But whom will she find here?

1026
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:12,165
But son if we can find a
nice boy I think it'll work out

1027
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:16,707
So you're looking for
someone conservative homely..

1028
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:20,415
in other words a very boring guy.

1029
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:25,290
Because interesting boys like
you Never make for good husbands

1030
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:27,874
Thanks aunty. I am not interested.

1031
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:31,124
Okay now give me a nice smile.
Smile smile. Hold it there!

1032
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,082
What happened uncle?

1033
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:39,874
Nothing just remembered someone

1034
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,707
I met her a few years ago.
She's very beautiful

1035
01:20:48,416 --> 01:20:51,582
The only beauty I could
never capture in my camera

1036
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:53,915
nor into my life

1037
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:58,249
I should not be asking but..
- Then don't ask

1038
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:01,874
Caught you.
- Come in I'll tell you

1039
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:04,582
I was just back from London
after a course in photography

1040
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,957
You know I was part of
this very glamorous life..

1041
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:11,082
Then I met Anju

1042
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:13,999
Anju's world was very
different from mine.

1043
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:18,624
She was a plain simple girl.
With a strong mind

1044
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,999
That's the quality in
her that sets her apart

1045
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:26,582
You may have conquered
the word but..

1046
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:28,582
..you want to come back home
to a woman like this.

1047
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:30,499
We married

1048
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:35,082
To make each other happy
initially we made our compromises

1049
01:21:35,833 --> 01:21:37,415
Then followed the questions..
Like where-are-you-going..

1050
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,207
..who-is-she? Maybe I was
not prepared for marriage

1051
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:43,457
Afterwards questions that had
never been raised cropped up

1052
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:47,540
I guess I was not ready for marriage.

1053
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:51,624
With time there was more work
more quarrels. in a fit of rage..

1054
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:56,707
I took up a six-month
assignment in America

1055
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:01,124
She didn't ask questions
I gave no answers

1056
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,082
For six months I
waited for a call from her;

1057
01:22:05,833 --> 01:22:07,249
maybe she waited for mine

1058
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:13,874
Then six months became a
year and years became ages.

1059
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:19,207
We never.. On one
count I'm grateful to her

1060
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:24,165
She never let Karan feel
the distance between us

1061
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:30,082
I don't know why I'm telling you this

1062
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:35,374
.. I never even confided in myself

1063
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:37,415
Neither to me

1064
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:41,957
Wish you had tried at least once..

1065
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:50,915
So neither have you
been able to forgive me

1066
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:56,249
I forgave you long ago Dad.

1067
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:01,915
But I never got over what you did

1068
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:08,624
I am sorry son. I am
really very sorry.

1069
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:18,540
Maybe you ought to say
sorry to someone else

1070
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:22,457
I am sorry Rhea.

1071
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,332
You must think I'm evil.

1072
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:32,874
No one's evil. Evil
are the times that befall

1073
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,665
You're saying I've
fallen into evil times

1074
01:23:37,041 --> 01:23:40,624
There you are. Come inside.
I don't serve a bad lunch

1075
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:44,040
Come inside first eat and see. Come.
- Come please.

1076
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:50,082
I never could bring up
this topic with my dad

1077
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:54,499
Thanks Rhea.
- it is okay.

1078
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:59,540
if you tell anyone I cried

1079
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:06,207
I'll kill you. No I am serious.
I'll kill you. Remember it.

1080
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:10,290
Okay thank you very
much for the lunch.

1081
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,207
Wish you good luck.

1082
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,332
Thank you very much.

1083
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,540
You are here again?
- Hello is it Karan's dad? - Hi.

1084
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:19,165
Hi Nicole hi sweety.

1085
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:21,124
Hi do you stay here?

1086
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,457
The one with the dog?

1087
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:26,040
No no she is saying
she loves your dog.

1088
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:30,249
Thanks.
- Welcome. - Have fun. - I'll try.

1089
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:35,749
You are a brat you'll never progress.
- Aunty don't say that. Greetings.

1090
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:37,290
Bye dad see you.
- Bye.

1091
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,415
I wonder what her mother's like.
- What..?

1092
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:45,040
Bye uncle.

1093
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:50,874
Rhea father and son will
never progress. Come on let's go.

1094
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,790
Mamma.
- is that son and father..

1095
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:55,165
Let's go in.

1096
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:04,749
Karan.
- Just 2 seconds Rhea. Coming.

1097
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:11,874
You aren't dressed yet? Not
going to the airport? Get dressed

1098
01:25:12,833 --> 01:25:15,457
Spare me.
- Why?

1099
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,915
I can't bid goodbyes

1100
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:22,332
Sorry.

1101
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:29,374
Getting late I should make a move

1102
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:32,915
Take care of yourself.

1103
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:38,332
I love you.

1104
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:53,665
Have a nice flight bye bye.

1105
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:02,999
Remember we met at the airport

1106
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:07,832
After that first meeting..
I really hated you.

1107
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:11,332
I know same here.
- Not at all.

1108
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:13,665
I really hated you.

1109
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:15,165
You hated me.

1110
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:17,124
That's why you tried to kiss me

1111
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:22,749
Only tried?
- Shut up. - Thank you.

1112
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,540
Then I hated you so much all because..

1113
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:31,290
you didn't know how to talk
you had no respect for women..

1114
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:34,415
..you were so ill-mannered
and irritating - Not Bad.

1115
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:39,207
After all these years you
remember everything about me?

1116
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,540
Did you hit upon a
story for your Hum-Tum?

1117
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:57,290
I have something in mind. in the end
who knows Hum-Tum may fall in love

1118
01:26:59,625 --> 01:27:01,790
All the best.
- Thank you.

1119
01:27:02,625 --> 01:27:08,374
You know Karan I didn't think
I would ever admit this to you.

1120
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:10,999
I think I'll miss you

1121
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:19,374
We're going to see each
other very soon. Guess why?

1122
01:27:20,583 --> 01:27:22,290
Because though life's a long while

1123
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:24,499
we have very little time

1124
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:55,457
Are we going to be friends now?

1125
01:27:55,791 --> 01:28:00,082
Friends? But you always said
you'd never make friends with girls

1126
01:28:01,208 --> 01:28:03,332
Pretty girls are the exception

1127
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:07,790
And I am not pretty!
- When did I say that?

1128
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:10,540
Are you saying I'm pretty?

1129
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:17,582
Actually..
- listen. - Yes. - Shut up! - Okay.

1130
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:34,207
Rhea is coming after 3 days?
- Yes

1131
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,874
Whose friend is she yours or mine?
- Mine

1132
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:40,499
And am I your chauffeur or secretary?
- Neither

1133
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:47,540
Then why do you want me to
pick her up from the airport?

1134
01:28:47,666 --> 01:28:49,665
Because I want you to marry her

1135
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:58,207
You want me to marry Rhea..?
- Exactly

1136
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:03,624
Come on Mihir you're
perfect for each other

1137
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:06,624
if Rhea is perfect why
don't you marry her?

1138
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:10,874
Hey don't talk rubbish
dude. I can't marry Rhea. - Why?

1139
01:29:12,333 --> 01:29:17,749
I'm the sort a mother
would warn her daughter about

1140
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,624
You agree with me
thank you very much.

1141
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:26,082
I know Rhea. She needs a mature
experienced guy

1142
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:29,332
Which is you so shut up
and trust me. - I trust you.

1143
01:29:31,875 --> 01:29:36,665
in three days Rhea is coming.
Pick her up at the airport

1144
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:39,999
if you don't like her you
needn't see her ever again

1145
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,207
Okay so you are going
to pick her up. Thanks.

1146
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:47,707
When did I say yes?
- You didn't say no

1147
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:55,332
I can't believe it ..
I'm doing your bidding

1148
01:29:55,458 --> 01:29:57,999
Oh come now Mihir stop all this.

1149
01:29:58,333 --> 01:30:01,290
if Rhea realizes that I'm
introducing the two of you

1150
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:03,082
She will kill me alright?

1151
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:05,915
After the wedding can I
tell her we're married?

1152
01:30:06,291 --> 01:30:11,790
Not bad! Already
contemplating the marriage?

1153
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:15,832
Rhea is putting up with her aunt.
She knows the address all right

1154
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:20,624
Come on I'm busy. Hang up

1155
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:27,290
Nice sport. Australia fields
so well even in video games

1156
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:42,874
You Rhea.
- Yes.. you..?

1157
01:30:43,166 --> 01:30:47,415
Hi I am Karan sorry Mihir.

1158
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:52,374
So you are Mihir. Myself Mrs.
Parminder Prakash

1159
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,290
How handsome You're just
like Karan described you

1160
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:58,874
Karan described..?

1161
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:05,915
No.. he didn't. He only said
Mihir would receive us instead of him

1162
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:12,624
You couldn't tell me that before?
- Such a long fight. I'm at wits' end

1163
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:16,790
Sorry I mean.
- Hi hello.

1164
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:20,957
Something cropped up suddenly.
Karan is busy.. so I had to come

1165
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:26,415
Suddenly? But you said Karan
informed my Mummy about you..

1166
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:31,249
Really? The car is
parked outside. Shall we..?

1167
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:33,624
Which car do you have?

1168
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:37,665
Just asking because
we've got so much luggage.

1169
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:41,082
Don't mind.
- Come.

1170
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:44,832
No no it is okay. Please..
- Good manners.

1171
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,915
Come come let's go.

1172
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:51,249
There's something about India

1173
01:31:51,791 --> 01:31:53,499
The country has a smell of its own..

1174
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:57,040
look kids defecating along the kerb

1175
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:59,665
Nice to be here

1176
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:06,457
Son what do you do?
- I run a business in computers

1177
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:09,707
I see. How much turnover?

1178
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:16,332
Mamma! - Rhea is also a
computer buff - Really?

1179
01:32:16,916 --> 01:32:20,582
Not much except office computing

1180
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,707
Karan says you run a store in Paris.

1181
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:29,874
Not store. Boutique of Indian designs

1182
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:33,290
Boutique is a store no..?

1183
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:37,332
You come into India and you
grab a paper! Always reading

1184
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:40,290
Times of India carries
Karan's Hum-Tum

1185
01:32:44,041 --> 01:32:45,624
This Karan is..

1186
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:51,082
Yes Karan..
- Yes this Karan is..

1187
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,832
I just joined the chorus

1188
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,249
in Bombay you don't
disconnect phones at night?

1189
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:24,957
Yes Karan.
- Hey hi Rhea.

1190
01:33:25,375 --> 01:33:26,874
Don't tell me hi. I am okay.

1191
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,540
You're angry? Okay I'm going home.
- What?

1192
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:33,165
I'm standing outside your house

1193
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:39,415
I'm famished. Can I
find something to eat?

1194
01:33:42,208 --> 01:33:43,915
it is nice to be back in India.

1195
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:47,290
Mamma is right. Your
country is your own

1196
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:50,207
Who told you to live in Paris?

1197
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,707
I am sorry I didn't mean..
- No no.

1198
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:59,707
Don't be sorry. Karan
actually the thing is..

1199
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:02,249
if I stayed in India..

1200
01:34:02,833 --> 01:34:07,290
..everyone would've begun
to insist that I marry again

1201
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:13,832
After Sameer died
I wasn't interested anymore

1202
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:22,582
You can't stop loving someone because
he's dead. I'll always love Sameer

1203
01:34:23,541 --> 01:34:24,665
I will always love him.

1204
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:27,582
Yes I can understand that Rhea but..

1205
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:31,874
..does it mean that you can't
pick up the threads of your life?

1206
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:33,874
You can't stop living.

1207
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:41,624
True. But to start afresh
one needs a good companion

1208
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:44,082
Not someone in an arranged marriage.

1209
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:45,957
What if you might find someone?

1210
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:48,332
What rubbish. Hey tell me.

1211
01:34:48,458 --> 01:34:50,249
I think arranged marriages work

1212
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:52,665
I know much about arrange marriage.

1213
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,290
What are you talking?
- I am serious dear..

1214
01:34:54,416 --> 01:34:58,457
Let's pretend I'm here to
look up an arranged match

1215
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:00,665
Pretences at 2 am!

1216
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,165
Hello Rhea I'm Champak Bhumiya

1217
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:06,457
Your aunt's niece's
daughter' friend speaks highly of you

1218
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:10,499
She says we're perfect for
each other. Made for each other

1219
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:14,374
Made for each other Rhea. - Why not.
- Come on Rhea don't be a fool.

1220
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,957
Not Champak Bhumiya. if
a genuine smart guy..

1221
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:22,082
asks you whether after
so many years in Paris..

1222
01:35:22,208 --> 01:35:24,790
will you be able to adjust
to Bombay life? With me?

1223
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:26,832
Sandwich.
- Thank you.

1224
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:30,624
Hey Rhea come on just sit down.
- Come on Karan. it is not funny.

1225
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:34,665
it is funny. it is really funny.
Remember fun.. come on. - Okay.

1226
01:35:35,625 --> 01:35:39,040
Okay what were you asking?
- After Paris..

1227
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:41,665
will you be able to adjust in Bombay?

1228
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:46,082
More important than the city..

1229
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:49,290
..is adjustment between people.
if two people are happy together..

1230
01:35:49,416 --> 01:35:51,082
Bombay or Paris what difference?

1231
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:54,790
10/10 it is a perfect answer.
- Thank you.

1232
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,874
After the marriage will you work?

1233
01:35:57,208 --> 01:35:59,374
You don't want me to work afterwards?

1234
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,915
No no I think it is great.

1235
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:03,915
I think every woman should work.

1236
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:07,790
Not as a pass time.
Serious work. Like you Really

1237
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:10,790
Now that is a perfect answer 10/10.
- Thank you.

1238
01:36:11,125 --> 01:36:14,332
Now what about kids.
- What about kids..?

1239
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:19,415
Not you. Aren't you supposed
to ask me? whether I love kids?

1240
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:22,999
Yes do you love kids?
- Of course

1241
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,832
First I want a daughter.
Beautiful intelligent. Like you

1242
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,499
I'll make a fine daddy

1243
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:32,790
if I find someone like me
flirting with her I'll break his legs

1244
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:38,374
You think that will
make you a fine daddy?

1245
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:40,957
Look you'll make a fine mother

1246
01:36:41,333 --> 01:36:43,749
What harm if I spoil
the kids a little bit?

1247
01:36:44,166 --> 01:36:47,040
So I do all the hard work
and you have all the fun?

1248
01:36:47,166 --> 01:36:50,040
Yes look at it from my point of
view and it's a wonderful marriage

1249
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:56,332
A puppy is all it'll take to
complete the family portrait

1250
01:36:56,583 --> 01:36:59,415
Let's call him Tommy.
- Awful name

1251
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,374
Okay Tommy. On one condition.
You take Tommy out for walks

1252
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:05,999
I can't do all this.
- Done.

1253
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:11,582
I'll only feed him morsels
from my plate. "Tommy take"

1254
01:37:11,708 --> 01:37:12,874
That's all I am going to do.

1255
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,082
Apart from spoiling the kids
and Tommy what else will you do?

1256
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:19,832
What else is left to be done?
I'll live happily ever after..

1257
01:37:19,916 --> 01:37:23,832
with my kids and Tommy ..
and of course you. Sorry

1258
01:37:23,916 --> 01:37:25,790
So I come after the kids and Tommy.

1259
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:29,832
And yes.. with you too.
- I come after the kids and Tommy?

1260
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:31,374
No Rhea it is.. I am sorry.

1261
01:37:33,333 --> 01:37:36,207
Mention me after the kids and Tommy

1262
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,332
and I'll hack you into small bits..

1263
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:44,665
and I'll feed you to Tommy. - Okay
I'm sorry. No more kids-or-Tommy

1264
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,207
I'll always love you
more than anyone else

1265
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:57,832
See how easy it is to
discuss an arranged marriage..?

1266
01:37:58,416 --> 01:37:59,749
We almost got married

1267
01:38:12,291 --> 01:38:17,332
Rhea!
- Hi aunty. - Hi dear. - How are you?

1268
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,165
You look gorgeous.
- I ought to be telling you that

1269
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:24,124
You have not changed.
- is it?

1270
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:31,332
Sit. How about coffee tea juice..?
- Just coming from our place

1271
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:34,207
And you know Mamma never
let’s me leave before breakfast

1272
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:36,582
How is she?
- She is okay. - Great.

1273
01:38:37,833 --> 01:38:38,915
Aunty this is for you.
- For me?

1274
01:38:46,791 --> 01:38:47,832
it is pretty.

1275
01:38:48,291 --> 01:38:51,082
But Rhea these formalities..

1276
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:54,707
Actually Karan's dad
has sent it for you

1277
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:01,457
He's fine.

1278
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:11,249
Rhea I'm the one who makes
your Ma laugh all the time

1279
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:14,624
And you make my Mom
upset as soon as you step in

1280
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:15,957
Sorry aunty.

1281
01:39:16,083 --> 01:39:17,415
Don't fall for what she says

1282
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:21,582
She is a very bad girl.
- Karan shut up!

1283
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:32,707
I hope they send 150 pieces. I'll pay
after I've checked the consignment

1284
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:35,249
if I find a one-piece short in
the shipment..- God! One piece..

1285
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:38,290
how much poorer will it make you
how much richer will he become?

1286
01:39:38,791 --> 01:39:41,249
You women are forever
cribbing over one Rupee..

1287
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:44,415
..one potato one coriander leaf..

1288
01:39:45,375 --> 01:39:50,999
why fight over trivia?
- it isn't about money. it's principle

1289
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:52,415
it is about principles.

1290
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:55,415
But why discuss principles with you?

1291
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:58,207
Rhea shut up.

1292
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:04,665
Yes Mihir come over park the car

1293
01:40:06,958 --> 01:40:09,915
Mihir is coming?
- Yes.. I forgot to ask you..

1294
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:13,790
How did you find Mihir?
- Okay.

1295
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:17,999
But what is Mihir doing here?
- I thought we'd have lunch together

1296
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:23,415
Hey. - Hi Karan. - How are you?
- Good. - Tell him hi. - Hi.

1297
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:24,999
So how was your shopping?

1298
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,165
I wasn't shopping. it was business

1299
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:32,082
I'm hungry. Where
are we going for lunch?

1300
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:36,582
Oh! No.
- What happened? - Lunch reminds me..

1301
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:40,332
I have to meet Diana.
- Who's this lady?

1302
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:44,207
Just a friend. Met her a
week ago. Strictly business

1303
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,915
She is damn hot Mihir
you should meet her. Okay.

1304
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:51,415
Not your first lunch date with Diana?
- Lunch yes. For the first time

1305
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,082
Couple of days ago
we went out for dinner

1306
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:55,707
You go ahead and have lunch.

1307
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:57,874
I'll see you afterwards
for coffee. Got to run

1308
01:40:57,958 --> 01:40:59,874
Karan!

1309
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,707
I know a great joint for grilled fish.

1310
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:16,665
Rhea.
- Yes sorry.

1311
01:41:16,791 --> 01:41:19,040
I know a great joint for grilled fish.

1312
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:21,999
I don't like grilled fish

1313
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:26,165
Where to? China garden? Delhi Durbar?

1314
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:32,374
I forgot.. Mamma has cooked lunch

1315
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:34,374
Will you drop me home?

1316
01:41:34,958 --> 01:41:36,165
Yes sure why not.

1317
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:40,832
Next to your place
there's a Dosa Diner

1318
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:49,665
Today's my birthday.

1319
01:41:50,625 --> 01:41:55,165
Strange! Karan never told me.
- Karan must've forgotten

1320
01:41:57,791 --> 01:42:01,290
Karan is such a.. he is such a..

1321
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:11,457
Anyway happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1322
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:24,290
Happy birthday to you.

1323
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:30,874
Happy birthday dear Mihir.
Happy birthday to you.

1324
01:42:33,166 --> 01:42:36,874
Strange you never
reminded me it's your birthday

1325
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:42,540
Sorry I forgot that you forget.
- Never mind. Eat cake

1326
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,582
Something tells me I'm
forgetting something

1327
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:51,624
How dare you?
- Daina. - Daina.

1328
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,874
You are a very bad boy.
- Listen I am really very sorry.

1329
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,790
Enough of your apologies!
You forget that you invited me?

1330
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:01,790
I waited for you for ages

1331
01:43:02,541 --> 01:43:03,874
You must be Rhea.

1332
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:07,290
Don't ask me how I know you're Rhea

1333
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:10,165
And you are Mihir.

1334
01:43:10,583 --> 01:43:11,874
Happy birthday.

1335
01:43:12,625 --> 01:43:14,457
What sort of birthday..?
No champagne?

1336
01:43:16,625 --> 01:43:21,540
To new friends.
- I don't drink. - Wow.

1337
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:24,374
A man who doesn't drink and
is man enough to admit to it..

1338
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,624
I am impressed. Karan
I really liked your friend.

1339
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,040
I think he is cute.
- Cute?

1340
01:43:31,416 --> 01:43:33,207
Mihir you didn't tell me what you do.

1341
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:36,124
- I run a computer company.
Micro India

1342
01:43:36,375 --> 01:43:38,082
We design computer systems

1343
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:43,332
Really? All the computers in
my office were sourced from you?

1344
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:47,665
Wiz Entertainment.
- You're Diana Fernandez?

1345
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,957
Right. - No wonder your
voice sounded familiar.

1346
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:52,540
We've spoken several
times on the phone

1347
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,290
You actually spoke to her
or you heard

1348
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:57,332
of her conversations over the phone?

1349
01:43:57,916 --> 01:44:01,915
After so many
conversations now we meet.. amazing

1350
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:04,415
How amazing

1351
01:44:05,166 --> 01:44:08,249
Karan what a boring song.
- Awful song

1352
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:10,249
No way I love this song.

1353
01:44:10,708 --> 01:44:13,249
For the first time I
danced with a girl to that song

1354
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:15,665
So sweet.
- Close dance.

1355
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:20,665
How cute. Me and you Mihir
come let's dance.

1356
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:26,082
Just calm down.

1357
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:50,624
How strange. For the many times that

1358
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:53,915
they talked business they never met

1359
01:44:54,375 --> 01:44:56,790
One chance meeting and
they've taken to each other

1360
01:44:57,250 --> 01:45:00,999
Somewhat too fast. Who'll
say it's their first meeting?.

1361
01:45:01,125 --> 01:45:03,832
Karan shut up.

1362
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:18,874
Sometimes the first look is enough.
Sometimes it takes so many meetings

1363
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:21,290
What..?
- True

1364
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,374
Wow

1365
01:45:43,291 --> 01:45:44,832
I mean Mihir and Diana..

1366
01:45:46,166 --> 01:45:51,665
you know.. Mihir and Diana
they're so unlike

1367
01:45:52,416 --> 01:45:54,290
I don't know how they liked each other

1368
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:55,874
They're so different

1369
01:45:55,958 --> 01:45:59,874
Karan. Have you heard that phrase
that opposites attract? - Yes.

1370
01:46:00,875 --> 01:46:02,707
it's widely accepted that

1371
01:46:02,916 --> 01:46:07,749
the more varied the match the
better it is for the relationship

1372
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:10,749
She makes up for her husband's flaws;

1373
01:46:11,041 --> 01:46:13,332
he makes up for his
wife's shortcomings

1374
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:15,665
Which makes for a perfect marriage.

1375
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:18,124
Wow Rhea you ought
to be writing a book

1376
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:20,707
Principles of Marriage by Rhea

1377
01:46:22,166 --> 01:46:26,540
Seriously.
- Good evening everybody.

1378
01:46:29,916 --> 01:46:33,499
Tonight I'm happy.. elated

1379
01:46:34,916 --> 01:46:36,165
Guess why?

1380
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,415
I just got engaged Mihir and I..

1381
01:46:44,416 --> 01:46:50,665
..and the person instrumental
in getting us together..is..

1382
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:57,457
Rhea. Cheers.

1383
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:07,499
if Rhea liked Mihir
if Mihir liked Rhea..

1384
01:47:08,333 --> 01:47:10,415
then you and I
wouldn’t have been here today

1385
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:15,749
Karan tried his best to make
Rhea and Mihir fall in love

1386
01:47:16,416 --> 01:47:22,415
Then I materialized
I guess I got lucky

1387
01:47:23,041 --> 01:47:28,332
So.. cheers to Rhea once
again Oh Mihir I love you

1388
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:37,832
Please give me a chance to explain

1389
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:40,457
Rhea.
- How dare you Karan?

1390
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:43,332
You've no right to scorn me.

1391
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:46,332
Scorn? I was arranging your marriage.
- Marriage?

1392
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:48,749
You know because of all this..

1393
01:47:48,833 --> 01:47:50,124
I went away to Paris to avoid this

1394
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:51,499
You know it..

1395
01:47:51,666 --> 01:47:52,832
..because out there no one
would be arranging weddings for me

1396
01:47:52,916 --> 01:47:54,415
I don't get it!

1397
01:47:54,541 --> 01:47:57,665
Why won't people leave a girl
in peace until she's married?

1398
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,207
is marriage the sole
purpose of life for us?

1399
01:48:00,541 --> 01:48:04,249
Without a man in her life a
woman's life is incomplete?

1400
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:07,082
What tangent are you getting at?
- And you Karan..?

1401
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,707
I never expected you
to behave like this

1402
01:48:10,958 --> 01:48:13,374
How could you be one of them?
- Come on Rhea..

1403
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:15,749
..over something so little..
- it's nothing so little

1404
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:18,832
it is about my life. My personal life.

1405
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:21,665
Not everything in life is a joke

1406
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:25,207
So what now? Do we
sit down for a quarrel?

1407
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:29,415
Forget it You don't
get what I'm saying

1408
01:48:29,541 --> 01:48:31,624
Of course I don't
understand what you say.

1409
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:34,499
I thought you and Mihir..
- What about Mihir and I..?

1410
01:48:34,625 --> 01:48:35,749
What is wrong with you?

1411
01:48:35,875 --> 01:48:40,582
How can you think like this?
Did you ever ask me what I want?

1412
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:42,832
I only want to see you happy

1413
01:48:42,916 --> 01:48:44,707
You think I'll be happy with Mihir?

1414
01:48:44,833 --> 01:48:47,040
Will you be happy with a guy like me?

1415
01:48:48,458 --> 01:48:50,499
Come on tell me.

1416
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,249
Now why are you quite?

1417
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:03,290
Enough is enough..

1418
01:49:03,916 --> 01:49:05,832
Listen Rhea.
- Don't follow me Karan!

1419
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:24,540
Love is the problem isn't it?

1420
01:49:27,916 --> 01:49:31,874
Karan was right. A boy and
a girl can never be friends

1421
01:49:32,625 --> 01:49:35,290
Because love always comes in the way

1422
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:38,499
Come on Rhea.

1423
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:41,790
How long will you hide
your feelings from each other?

1424
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:47,457
if you expect Karan to
make the first move forget it

1425
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,457
That fool doesn't even
realize he's in love

1426
01:49:52,125 --> 01:49:53,999
No one knows Karan more than I

1427
01:49:54,125 --> 01:49:56,790
Every year he forgets
my birthday but

1428
01:49:56,875 --> 01:49:58,790
..each little word
about you he remembers

1429
01:49:59,708 --> 01:50:01,874
if not love what else is it?

1430
01:50:04,083 --> 01:50:07,540
He loves you Rhea. He
loves you very much.

1431
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:13,540
True love is so hard to come by
it happens only once in a lifetime

1432
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,124
You are lucky.

1433
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:18,874
To have found this
joy twice you're lucky

1434
01:50:37,166 --> 01:50:40,874
Simple. I'm not a nice guy

1435
01:50:42,458 --> 01:50:47,040
Not a nice guy and
when it comes to girls..

1436
01:50:47,166 --> 01:50:51,124
first class scoundrel.
- He's one of us

1437
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:52,999
You get it?

1438
01:50:53,750 --> 01:51:00,499
For the first time in my life
I wanted to do good for a girl

1439
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:04,832
Did I do anything wrong?
- No

1440
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:08,749
I did.
- You did..? - Big mistake I did

1441
01:51:10,833 --> 01:51:15,124
Big mistake.. I broke her heart

1442
01:51:16,666 --> 01:51:23,499
The tears.. welled up from her heart.

1443
01:51:24,208 --> 01:51:26,582
I made her cry.
- Made her cry?

1444
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:28,915
Very bad.

1445
01:51:29,416 --> 01:51:35,624
When her tears stream down here..

1446
01:51:36,833 --> 01:51:39,082
..why do I ache in here?

1447
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:43,207
Her eyes her tears

1448
01:51:44,625 --> 01:51:45,832
And here it aches?

1449
01:51:48,166 --> 01:51:50,540
is this any justice?
- No

1450
01:51:50,666 --> 01:51:55,499
Oh yes it's justice This is justice

1451
01:51:56,833 --> 01:51:58,582
if the burden of both tears and pain

1452
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:02,457
were hers what justice would it be?

1453
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:13,624
Were her tears and her pain to
be mine justice would be done.

1454
01:52:14,583 --> 01:52:15,707
Understood?

1455
01:52:15,833 --> 01:52:19,540
Understood.
- What can you understand?

1456
01:52:20,541 --> 01:52:23,874
She says I don't understand anything.

1457
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:30,249
if I never understood anything..
how come I understand

1458
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:35,165
What am I and what is she?

1459
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:39,874
Understand?

1460
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,915
Understood. She's coming for you

1461
01:52:46,083 --> 01:52:50,707
She isn't after me.
- Behind you

1462
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:57,749
Hide the glasses.
No drinking in front of a lady.

1463
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,499
But I can drink because I'm
not a nice guy. Pass my glass.

1464
01:53:04,875 --> 01:53:07,457
Karan come home.

1465
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:11,624
Rhea I'm not a nice guy.

1466
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:13,832
I'll leave brother.

1467
01:53:17,375 --> 01:53:18,790
I am not a nice man.

1468
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:37,249
"I and you.."

1469
01:53:48,916 --> 01:54:06,374
Let our sighs caress

1470
01:54:06,708 --> 01:54:12,582
Let subdued heartbeats race

1471
01:54:12,875 --> 01:54:18,415
This moment craves.. a tryst..

1472
01:54:18,541 --> 01:54:29,249
"I and you.."

1473
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,415
Your eyes let me enchant

1474
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:41,832
in your arms take me as I relent

1475
01:54:41,916 --> 01:54:47,457
This moment craves.. a tryst..

1476
01:54:47,583 --> 01:54:58,540
"I and you.."

1477
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:07,082
Let our sighs caress

1478
01:55:25,875 --> 01:55:37,374
Slumber's caress
smears the kohl in your eyes

1479
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:48,124
Oh was it a fleeting
carnival of dreams..?

1480
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:54,582
Let desire consume us body and soul

1481
01:55:54,833 --> 01:56:00,790
Leave yourself to rock
amid abandon and ecstasy

1482
01:56:01,125 --> 01:56:06,582
This moment craves.. a tryst..

1483
01:56:06,708 --> 01:56:17,749
"I and you.."

1484
01:56:18,208 --> 01:56:26,082
Let our sighs caress

1485
01:56:53,916 --> 01:56:59,749
Caress me..

1486
01:56:59,833 --> 01:57:04,832
like symphony's strings

1487
01:57:05,541 --> 01:57:11,374
Darkness hidden in your tresses..

1488
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:16,499
let loose liberate my nights

1489
01:57:16,916 --> 01:57:22,332
Wait till night's veil
slips away from her bosom

1490
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:28,582
Wait for dew to moisten her petals

1491
01:57:28,916 --> 01:57:34,332
But this moment craves.. a tryst..

1492
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:45,582
"I and you.."

1493
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:51,707
Let our sighs caress

1494
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,790
Let subdued heartbeats race

1495
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:03,707
This moment craves.. a tryst..

1496
01:58:03,833 --> 01:59:23,124
"I and you.."

1497
01:59:37,416 --> 01:59:40,874
Calm down.

1498
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:44,374
Don't take God's name in vain

1499
01:59:46,708 --> 01:59:49,499
Where's Rhea?
- She isn't coming

1500
01:59:50,833 --> 01:59:52,540
You had a fight with her?

1501
01:59:53,250 --> 01:59:55,207
No she is just busy.

1502
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:58,082
My ring. Come on.

1503
02:00:01,291 --> 02:00:04,707
I left it in the car

1504
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:06,499
You don't say shit inside a church

1505
02:00:16,333 --> 02:00:19,832
We were supposed to come together
no? I waited for you.

1506
02:00:20,083 --> 02:00:23,332
I got busy over here.

1507
02:00:25,333 --> 02:00:26,707
Just a second.

1508
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:29,874
I can't even face her

1509
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:33,332
idiot even his tie isn't matching

1510
02:00:39,583 --> 02:00:41,290
What must she think of me?

1511
02:00:42,708 --> 02:00:46,374
Why did we take so long to
know each other's minds?

1512
02:00:49,666 --> 02:00:51,374
Whatever happened was wrong

1513
02:00:51,875 --> 02:00:53,749
Why does it feel so perfect?

1514
02:00:55,166 --> 02:00:56,290
Friends.

1515
02:00:56,708 --> 02:00:58,165
We are gathered together..

1516
02:00:58,291 --> 02:00:59,707
I've lost her forever

1517
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:02,082
I don't want to lose him ever

1518
02:01:02,208 --> 02:01:06,457
On the eve of Mihir
and Diana Fernandez.

1519
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:08,457
is this the end of our relationship..?

1520
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:10,915
The beginning of a new relationship..?

1521
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:13,749
As long as you both shall live.

1522
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:18,207
I do.

1523
02:01:53,208 --> 02:01:56,249
How can I start this conversation?
Please say something Karan

1524
02:01:57,833 --> 02:01:59,165
I am sorry Rhea.

1525
02:02:03,166 --> 02:02:04,707
I am really really sorry.

1526
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:08,332
Whatever happened should
never have come to pass

1527
02:02:08,458 --> 02:02:11,415
I mean I should never have done that

1528
02:02:13,083 --> 02:02:14,207
I am sorry.

1529
02:02:17,208 --> 02:02:18,790
We ought to get married.

1530
02:02:21,166 --> 02:02:26,499
Yes we ought to get married.
- Why?

1531
02:02:31,833 --> 02:02:33,915
Why do you want to marry me Karan?

1532
02:02:36,458 --> 02:02:39,749
Don't get me wrong Rhea
- You're getting me wrong

1533
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:46,915
Do you feel that
whatever happened was wrong?

1534
02:02:50,250 --> 02:02:53,124
Yes Rhea. The mistake was mine

1535
02:02:58,166 --> 02:03:00,540
Then we ought not to
commit another mistake

1536
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:06,249
We ought not to make another mistake
by marrying for the wrong reasons

1537
02:03:06,833 --> 02:03:08,249
Don't get me wrong.
- Enough Karan

1538
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:12,749
You need not say anything more

1539
02:03:14,458 --> 02:03:15,915
Need not say anything more

1540
02:03:17,458 --> 02:03:47,374
"I and you.."

1541
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:54,290
From the outset
I never liked that Mihir

1542
02:03:54,416 --> 02:03:57,915
He was always evading
questions How annoying

1543
02:03:59,458 --> 02:04:02,082
What makes you laugh?
- I'm not laughing Bobby

1544
02:04:02,208 --> 02:04:05,790
You've been laughing at me
forever on the sly. Sarcastically

1545
02:04:06,833 --> 02:04:09,915
Where are you going with those
Huge bags? Our fight is next week

1546
02:04:12,625 --> 02:04:13,999
What happened my child?

1547
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:26,499
I'm leaving

1548
02:04:29,208 --> 02:04:33,582
I don't know where .. for how long

1549
02:04:35,833 --> 02:04:43,624
For four years I kept you away
from your country your relatives

1550
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:46,582
Away from everybody.

1551
02:04:48,458 --> 02:04:52,415
This time I want to go away alone

1552
02:04:55,208 --> 02:05:03,165
I want to come to terms with
my life with myself on my own

1553
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:09,040
Let me be on my own Mamma please

1554
02:05:17,625 --> 02:05:20,165
Rhea my child..

1555
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:25,415
home for me is wherever you are

1556
02:05:25,833 --> 02:05:31,415
I'll never even ask you
why we're going or where

1557
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:36,249
But don't tear yourself away from me

1558
02:05:38,458 --> 02:05:40,915
I'm coming with you. Period

1559
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:43,165
Wait I'm coming

1560
02:05:45,791 --> 02:05:47,874
My darling baby

1561
02:05:49,416 --> 02:05:54,874
God can't be everywhere.
That's why He made mothers

1562
02:05:58,541 --> 02:06:01,332
Love you dear. I love you.

1563
02:06:03,458 --> 02:06:06,207
Karan. Have you
finished your breakfast?

1564
02:06:07,291 --> 02:06:10,165
What's the matter? it's been two days

1565
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:12,374
and you're completely uncommunicative

1566
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,040
And there's no news of Rhea.
Have the two of you had a fight?

1567
02:06:18,833 --> 02:06:21,165
Karan can you pick
up the phone please.

1568
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:25,415
This boy is too much

1569
02:06:27,208 --> 02:06:31,124
Hello hi Sheila how are you? Yes.

1570
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:36,165
Just a minute Sheila. Sheila
I'll have to call you back later.

1571
02:06:37,458 --> 02:06:40,582
You're not listening
you aren't talking

1572
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:43,207
you aren't answering phones
doorbells

1573
02:06:43,541 --> 02:06:44,999
Just like your Daddy

1574
02:06:46,541 --> 02:06:47,999
Whose son is he after all?

1575
02:06:49,375 --> 02:06:50,624
You..?

1576
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,165
Can I come in?

1577
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,707
Karan.
- Dad.

1578
02:07:06,083 --> 02:07:07,624
What are you doing here?

1579
02:07:08,208 --> 02:07:10,040
Coming directly from
the airport to see you.

1580
02:07:11,833 --> 02:07:14,457
How have you been?
- I'm fine

1581
02:07:15,125 --> 02:07:18,040
it shows. How's Rhea?

1582
02:07:20,166 --> 02:07:21,457
What do you want to ask?

1583
02:07:25,041 --> 02:07:30,040
I want to know why you're running
away from your life. Like I did

1584
02:07:32,458 --> 02:07:33,540
What..?

1585
02:07:34,250 --> 02:07:38,374
in my personal life..
I took a lot of wrong decisions

1586
02:07:38,833 --> 02:07:40,332
which I have come to regret

1587
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:46,290
I had the loveliest the most
loving wife in the whole word

1588
02:07:47,125 --> 02:07:48,665
But I never could understand her

1589
02:07:51,041 --> 02:07:56,832
Finally I realised how much I
had been given and what I had lost

1590
02:08:03,166 --> 02:08:07,165
Every father wants his son
to follow in his footsteps.

1591
02:08:08,375 --> 02:08:12,332
I must be.. the first father in
the whole world who prays everyday..

1592
02:08:12,708 --> 02:08:14,707
may my son never become like me

1593
02:08:16,458 --> 02:08:20,415
But sometimes when I look at you..

1594
02:08:20,875 --> 02:08:23,749
I fear I may have passed on
to you my legacy of failures.

1595
02:08:24,375 --> 02:08:27,749
I fear.. you may lose faith
in relationships because of me

1596
02:08:29,541 --> 02:08:33,165
But then I look at Rhea
and my fears are allayed

1597
02:08:33,833 --> 02:08:35,749
I feel she's the one who
can extricate my son..

1598
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:37,582
..from the orbs of my shadows

1599
02:08:38,833 --> 02:08:43,665
Rhea called me in Paris yesterday to
tell me that she's leaving forever

1600
02:08:45,833 --> 02:08:48,957
She'd say no more but I realised

1601
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:51,749
you've proven that you're my son

1602
02:08:52,291 --> 02:08:56,040
No one else could ever
break a heart so full of love

1603
02:08:56,708 --> 02:09:04,707
Dad I'm in love with Rhea. But
how can she love a guy like me

1604
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:07,499
it's what we fail to
grasp about women.

1605
02:09:07,875 --> 02:09:10,499
How can they love morons like us?

1606
02:09:11,833 --> 02:09:14,832
17 years ago
I broke someone's heart..

1607
02:09:15,125 --> 02:09:16,874
..someone I ought to have worshipped

1608
02:09:17,416 --> 02:09:19,540
God never gave me a second chance

1609
02:09:22,458 --> 02:09:24,415
You're about to make the same mistake.

1610
02:09:24,541 --> 02:09:27,290
Know it He won't
give you a next chance

1611
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:44,957
Karan where are you going?

1612
02:09:46,083 --> 02:09:47,374
After all I'm your son Dad.

1613
02:09:48,083 --> 02:09:50,082
in matters of the heart
I'm slow on the uptake

1614
02:09:50,833 --> 02:09:54,999
But now that I know I'm not
wasting 17 years trying to find her

1615
02:10:05,625 --> 02:10:10,749
The second chance God never gives.
We ought to seize it ourselves..

1616
02:10:11,708 --> 02:10:13,582
like my son is doing

1617
02:10:15,833 --> 02:10:17,207
Like our son..?

1618
02:10:25,458 --> 02:10:28,165
For 3 hours we've
been only 2 inches apart

1619
02:10:28,458 --> 02:10:29,874
and we don't know each other"

1620
02:10:29,958 --> 02:10:31,999
You rifled my bag?

1621
02:10:32,125 --> 02:10:33,290
Rhea Rhea Prakash.

1622
02:10:33,416 --> 02:10:36,457
Why must you spend on my tickets?
- Yes how are we related?

1623
02:10:36,583 --> 02:10:39,040
Karan Kapoor.

1624
02:10:39,458 --> 02:10:44,915
You're organising the wedding and
you don't know who the bride is?

1625
02:10:45,041 --> 02:10:46,540
Sameer is no longer part of my life

1626
02:10:51,041 --> 02:10:54,915
But to start afresh one
needs a good companion

1627
02:10:55,041 --> 02:10:59,165
in the end Hum-Tum might
end up falling in love

1628
02:10:59,291 --> 02:11:01,415
Have you heard of the phrase opposites attract...

1629
02:11:01,541 --> 02:11:05,415
I only want to see you happy.
- You think I'll be happy with Mihir?

1630
02:11:05,541 --> 02:11:07,374
Will you be happy with a guy like me?

1631
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:10,582
Mention me after the kids and Tommy

1632
02:11:11,041 --> 02:11:14,874
and I'll hack you into small bits..
and I'll feed you to Tommy."

1633
02:11:14,958 --> 02:11:18,999
Okay I'm sorry. No more kids-or-Tommy

1634
02:11:19,416 --> 02:11:22,165
I'll always love you
more than anyone else

1635
02:11:22,416 --> 02:11:25,415
I'll always love you
more than anyone else.

1636
02:11:25,708 --> 02:11:27,540
Tea or coffee sir.
- No thanks.

1637
02:11:28,833 --> 02:11:30,582
Okay I'll have a cup
of coffee with.. - Okay.

1638
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:34,207
With very little milk.
- Just about two spoons of milk.

1639
02:11:34,833 --> 02:11:37,749
A teaspoon of sugar.
- Brown sugar. - Brown sugar.

1640
02:11:38,208 --> 02:11:40,249
You know why?
- Why sir.

1641
02:11:40,625 --> 02:11:41,749
Because she loves me.

1642
02:11:52,833 --> 02:11:54,749
Sometimes the first look is enough.

1643
02:11:55,625 --> 02:11:57,915
Sometimes it takes so many meetings"

1644
02:11:58,041 --> 02:11:59,582
I think I'll miss you.

1645
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,040
Words..

1646
02:12:26,083 --> 02:12:28,082
my eyes spoke..

1647
02:12:28,208 --> 02:12:33,374
had you read..

1648
02:12:34,625 --> 02:12:40,874
you'd never lose me..

1649
02:12:40,958 --> 02:12:46,040
Wait..

1650
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:52,415
if that word.. you ever said..

1651
02:12:53,208 --> 02:12:59,624
in loneliness we wouldn't walk

1652
02:12:59,750 --> 02:13:05,582
Once a moment craved.. a tryst..

1653
02:13:05,708 --> 02:13:11,165
yours and mine

1654
02:13:11,916 --> 02:13:17,249
I and you.

1655
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:54,249
Only problem with Hum-Tum..
without you I'm incomplete

1656
02:14:13,041 --> 02:14:19,665
Many relationships fall apart because
people can't express themselves..

1657
02:14:20,166 --> 02:14:22,124
they can't talk their hearts out.

1658
02:14:22,833 --> 02:14:24,999
if you got something to tell someone..

1659
02:14:25,125 --> 02:14:29,832
just go ahead and say it.
Don't wait it might be too late

1660
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:35,249
Rhea couldn’t
understand my love because..

1661
02:14:35,375 --> 02:14:38,165
I was the one who
couldn't fathom my love.

1662
02:14:39,333 --> 02:14:40,624
Now she's gone..

1663
02:14:42,416 --> 02:14:44,582
and I never got
a chance to express myself.

1664
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:48,832
Out of this book..

1665
02:14:49,541 --> 02:14:53,124
I seek no riches no fame.

1666
02:14:54,583 --> 02:14:59,165
I only want to tell her..
how much I love her

1667
02:15:02,625 --> 02:15:03,790
That's it.

1668
02:15:05,291 --> 02:15:07,957
You believe you'll meet her again?

1669
02:15:08,958 --> 02:15:13,707
She will meet me. I'm sure..
because life’s a long while

1670
02:15:37,458 --> 02:15:39,040
Rain in January..?

1671
02:15:39,458 --> 02:15:41,665
it doesn't rain in January

1672
02:16:00,833 --> 02:16:02,665
it was bound to happen yes Karan?

1673
02:16:03,916 --> 02:16:05,374
Because whenever we've met..

1674
02:16:05,958 --> 02:16:07,665
something always happens

1675
02:16:11,333 --> 02:16:12,749
You read the book?

1676
02:16:15,083 --> 02:16:16,415
How did you like it?

1677
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:20,457
Reminded me of a friend

1678
02:16:23,458 --> 02:16:27,082
Ever told you about
this friend of mine?

1679
02:16:28,375 --> 02:16:29,707
Never

1680
02:16:31,041 --> 02:16:32,999
I met him many years ago

1681
02:16:33,291 --> 02:16:34,749
And you kept seeing him..

1682
02:16:35,916 --> 02:16:38,457
till he became my best friend

1683
02:16:38,958 --> 02:16:44,749
Then he fell in love with you.
Why did you walk away?

1684
02:16:45,208 --> 02:16:46,999
Because he didn't stop me

1685
02:16:49,666 --> 02:16:51,915
I don't like your friend one bit

1686
02:16:52,541 --> 02:16:56,082
Not a word against my friend

1687
02:16:57,583 --> 02:16:58,915
Then what do I say?

1688
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:02,957
What you've never said

1689
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:07,999
That I'll love you more
than the kids and Tommy?

1690
02:17:08,333 --> 02:17:12,624
You better! Else I'll
cut you into little bits..

1691
02:17:22,250 --> 02:17:23,707
I love you Rhea.

1692
02:17:50,750 --> 02:17:58,207
I told you there's one story about
us. - is this the end of our story?

1693
02:17:58,458 --> 02:18:01,165
No now's when our story begins

1694
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:07,707
Where are you going? You
didn't hear what he said?

1695
02:18:07,916 --> 02:18:10,165
Story isn't over

1696
02:18:31,916 --> 02:18:34,082
Who's this guy?

1697
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,915
Why is his cot so
close to my daughter's?

1698
02:18:39,125 --> 02:18:42,957
He's a new-born!
- You never know these guys

1699
02:18:43,083 --> 02:18:46,874
No sooner than they're born they
start flirting with pretty girls

1700
02:18:50,041 --> 02:18:51,624
Saw that..?

1701
02:18:52,125 --> 02:18:55,332
He's using kids' sign
language to call my daughter

1702
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:02,290
if he's like that I
wonder what his mother's like

1703
02:19:02,916 --> 02:19:06,082
When did you see his mother?
- Just a joke

1704
02:19:06,208 --> 02:19:07,582
When did you see his mother?

1705
02:19:10,083 --> 02:19:11,499
Look your baby is cute.

1706
02:19:15,416 --> 02:19:18,999
When did you see his mother?
- I saw his dad. Doesn't resemble him

1707
02:19:19,125 --> 02:19:20,624
I thought he must resemble his mother

1708
02:19:28,375 --> 02:19:34,290
You and I..

1709
02:19:41,541 --> 02:19:43,832
Because I love you

1710
02:19:53,250 --> 02:19:57,874
Boys get together and go out
Girls get together and chat

1711
02:20:00,083 --> 02:20:01,790
How will we get together?

1712
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,040
Deep in my heart you and I
