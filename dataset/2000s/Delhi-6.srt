2
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,165
ln every speck shines
His divine light

3
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,165
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

4
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,082
lf you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

5
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,999
Because we are all in
His form. That's worship

6
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:25,999
What would have happened
if the red-headed man..

7
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,624
..hadn't woken up at dawn
that day to relieve himself?

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:33,999
Perhaps life would have carried on
in Delhi-6 as it had for centuries

9
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,540
Perhaps my life might not have
been turned upside down either

10
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,457
But then again

11
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,624
When you got to go, you got to go!

12
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,832
ln the Treta Age of the Vedic era

13
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,332
The evil ten-headed Ravan was king

14
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:49,124
His powers were
renowned and he was feared

15
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:54,207
The Sun, Moon, Wind and
Fire were enslaved to Ravan

16
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,915
Dikpal, Suresh, Kuber,
Varun were scared of him

17
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,082
His abode was Lanka, made of gold

18
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:09,290
He didn't allow anyone to worship
Hari. He would call himself God

19
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:14,915
There was unrest in the universe..

20
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:19,665
Who could save the Earth,
Brahma thought

21
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:24,832
The hope of happiness was suppressed
by atrocities and sorrows

22
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:29,582
A divine voice spoke..

23
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:35,082
"Earth. My dear, Earth. l shall
get you out of this trouble."

24
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:41,165
"l will be born as Ram
in Awadh to save you"

25
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:44,749
The tumour is close
to her area of vision

26
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,415
l wouldn't recommend surgery at all

27
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,040
Especially with her history
of diabetes, blood pressure

28
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,999
Open-heart surgery will be too much

29
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,582
Even Medicaid won't cover it

30
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,582
Fatima, ask the fool
how long l've got?

31
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,665
Ma, don't say that! Allah forbid it

32
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,915
ls there any immediate danger?

33
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,915
Look, she will have to accept
this as a part of her life.

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,040
From now onwards
Give her a proper diet..

35
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,832
..and strict medication
and above all, keep her happy

36
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,707
l mean, avoid any kind of stress

37
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,665
That should do it for her

38
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,582
Who do you have in lndia?

39
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,707
Did these five years
with us bore you?

40
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,207
No, child. But you must merge
with the soil on which you are born

41
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,582
Ma, these are old proverbs

42
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,999
Son, think of it as my last wish

43
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,332
Ma, you're like a stubborn child

44
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,624
You make life difficult

45
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,165
You know l'll never go back
to Delhi

46
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,749
That's it

47
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,332
Dad, l'll take her

48
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:29,832
l couldn't see well in
the dark. He was 8ft.2

49
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,624
Covered in black hair

50
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,499
His nails shone like knives

51
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,207
Anyone who dares to sleep is dead!

52
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,832
He'll creep up on you
while you're snoring

53
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:46,540
He'll kill you. Murder you.

54
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,749
Ask. Who is he? Who is he?

55
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:53,040
Yes! The murderer is
none other than a monkey

56
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,999
A dark Black Monkey!

57
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,499
The Black Monkey kills.
The Black Monkey murders

58
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,707
Beware! 24/7. From Delhi, Kumar

59
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,582
The first one to welcome me
to Delhi was the Black Monkey

60
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,874
Perhaps destiny
was sending me a sign

61
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,749
Gran! Wait

62
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,540
Would you care for a paan?

63
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,332
Salaams, Mrs. Mehra!

64
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,915
Now l can die in peace

65
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,957
My love dragged you back You
couldn't stay away long - Grandma!

66
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,374
What are you doing?
You just can't leave me like that

67
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,165
l forgot all about you

68
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,249
Recognise him?

69
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,749
At last!

70
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:48,165
Now my eyes can rest
forever now. Let me hug you

71
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,332
Come on! Give me a hug Good boy

72
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,124
l'm Ali Baig!

73
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,874
Oh, l am so sorry.
l didn't recognise you

74
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,249
Awesome

75
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:26,332
A flood of people! Delhi is teeming
with life The constant buzz

76
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,915
Everything happening
at the same time.

77
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,790
Yet there is a kind of balance

78
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,040
A balance Amazing

79
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:47,290
No, no. You can't enter like
this First sweeten your mouth

80
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,665
Mamdu! How are you?

81
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,249
You're back at last!

82
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,582
Salaams, Hina! My sister-in-law
ls everything alright?

83
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,749
Why the long face?
Aren't you looking after her?

84
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,207
Gobar! How are you? Bless you, son

85
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,457
Guess who's here!
My grandson. Roshan

86
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,415
No, thank you

87
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,499
He isn't hungry

88
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:15,124
Only dogs eat when they're hungry.
Humans eat to bond with each other

89
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,665
You should have one. Have one

90
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,499
Only the lucky few
taste Mamdu's sweets

91
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,165
That's all right - What happened?
Or you can't go through

92
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:41,165
My beloved has returned home

93
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,415
People have great faith
in this place

94
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,832
They say if you hang a
bell with a pure heart

95
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,082
God will heed you

96
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,082
l hung a bell before
l left and prayed

97
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,915
to return with my whole family

98
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,749
God heard me. At least in part

99
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:05,040
Lord! Lord! Lord! My Almighty

100
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,957
Home at last! Your Paswaan Lane

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,499
lt hasn't changed a bit
- Your phone is ringing

102
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,290
lt's not mine

103
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,915
That's mine

104
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,707
Oh. Got cut.

105
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,999
Hey. Thanks for everything.

106
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,207
Welcome.

107
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,415
You must rest.
l'll take your leave

108
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,165
Have tea with us
- Some other time

109
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,707
Make sure you drop by
- Sure

110
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,332
That's my ball

111
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,207
Got it!

112
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,957
Mrs. Mehra is back

113
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,832
How are you, Rajjo?
- You look lovely

114
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,874
Urmila!
- How do you do?

115
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,749
Welcome to Delhi 6.

116
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,582
How's everyone at home?
- l am Rajjo

117
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,707
Come in. Come in

118
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,249
Rama!
- The blessings - Oh, yes

119
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,832
Rama. Bless you

120
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,040
How are you?
- You have come after long

121
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,874
Here
- You're looking so beautiful

122
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,082
A local speciality

123
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,249
Have one at least
- Home at last!

124
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,582
Are you all right?

125
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,915
Come

126
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,999
Roshan! Unlock the door

127
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,415
Which one?
- The small one

128
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,249
Come on. Come on. Move

129
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,582
The tulsi plant has dried.
Some water

130
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,832
Water

131
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,665
No water now

132
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,624
The tap runs only in the morning

133
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,999
lt's like the government.
Works on a whim

134
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,832
Nothing like Mother Earth!

135
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,874
l was just 16

136
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,082
Your grandfather married
me and brought me here

137
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,915
l'll leave the world
from this place now

138
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,457
Gran

139
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,707
Where's the bathroom?

140
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,999
This way

141
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,540
Don't waste water. lt's precious

142
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,249
Overflowing with emotion.

143
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,999
That's the beauty of lndia for you

144
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,165
Love is never given in small doses

145
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:21,415
Here, taps may run dry.

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,374
But amazingly tear ducts never do

147
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,040
Life is fine

148
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,749
Your grandfather! He never
accepted your parents' marriage

149
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,040
Never listened to anyone

150
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,249
"How is it possible?"

151
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,832
lt chewed him up till he died

152
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,665
He'd say: "How can my
son marry a Muslim?"

153
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,957
l wasn't happy either

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,999
But when l spent time
with your mother

155
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,082
l knew l was wrong

156
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,665
Damn it!

157
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,624
Must the power go now?

158
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,624
Your father was just as stubborn

159
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,832
My husband said:
"Get out!" So he left

160
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,249
And refused to come back

161
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,790
He came back once.
For your grandpa's funeral

162
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,540
See God's miracle, Roshan?

163
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,332
You were born on the same night

164
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,957
"Everything that
happens is God's will"

165
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,957
Only his moustache sets you apart

166
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,499
Grandma

167
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,207
Those are some hardcore moustaches
- Hey

168
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,249
You're still not ready?

169
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,790
Ravan is on his way to kidnap Sita

170
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,624
My scarf! Hey, mister

171
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,832
Can't you see?
Shall l buy you specs?

172
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,374
Sorry

173
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,999
Gran!

174
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:08,374
Lord Ram was born in Awadh
to put an end to all suffering

175
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:12,332
Lord Ram was born in Awadh..
- Salaam, Mrs. Mehra

176
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,040
Hello

177
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,790
You're so late
- Mamdu? Right?

178
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,999
Devotees' sufferings..

179
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,374
l can't enter without
eating something sweet, right?

180
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,749

You were once so chubby and healthy

You're a stick now
- Her American grandson

188

Why be stingy with the
Benevolent One? Right?

Miserly with his sister but loves
showing off in public - Bless you

Don't forget the
2500 you owe me! Right?

220
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,040
Jaigopalji, forget about me.

221
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,582
Tell me about your shirt. By God!

222
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,457

Look! The moneylender's wife is
decked out like his jewellery store

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,290
So our wives nag us
to buy the same jewels

00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,915
Later, he will give
us a loan against them

226
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,332
Let me photograph you
and your lovely wife

227

Are you here to stay or
you've come just to drop her off

233
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,332
No. l came to leave her
- What's your name?

234
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,165
Roshan Mehra

235
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,207
How are you? Hi

236
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,040
Any plans for the house?
- Lalaji, l'm still alive!

237
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,499
Let me know. l'll
fetch you a good price

238
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,457
Can family heritage
ever be for sale?

239
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,582
There's no family left

240
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,582
Money is better than
bricks and mortar. Right, son?

241
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,499
Hey, Grandma, isn't this the
bit with the golden deer? Cool.

242
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,165
Hey look, it's a golden deer!

243
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,499
You burger species!

244
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:43,915
With an arrow as sharp as His
gaze He struck the golden deer

245
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:48,290
The golden deer
changed into the demon Marich

246
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,249
O Brother Laxman!
Ram is calling for help

247
00:18:55,875 --> 00:19:03,165
As Laxman leaves, the
demon king Ravan appears

248
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:11,290
Sita hears his cry for alms!

249
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:16,790
The sage implores: "Give
alms in the name of God"

250
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,582
Mother, alms for the sage.
Stay well

251
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,999
"God keeps you well"

252
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,332
May you always prosper

253
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,332
The sage insists: "Sita,
step out of the ring of fire.

254
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:48,582
Hand me the offering"

255
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,832
As Sita stepped out,
the sage turned into..

256
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:58,040
..the demon Ravan

257
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,165
You sinner!

258
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,499
O Lord Ram,

259
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,749
save me!

260
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,790
Ladies and gentlemen

261

l may die but
l'll never break a promise!"

268
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:50,499
Lord Ram who sacrificed
everything in the name of duty

269
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,415
at His feet

270
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,707

Long live Maitri Devi!

275
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,749
ln lndia, the gods dance
to the whims of politicians

276
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,207
l thoroughly enjoyed the Ram Leela

277
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,832
A great show

278
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,624
But even more
fascinating were the people

279
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,915
l was so exhausted.

280
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,999
But the real drama
was yet to unfold

281
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,915
Hanuman! Go and see.

282
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,207
Two men have entered the forest

283
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,290
Hanuman!

284
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,915
Where are you?

285
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,999
Where has Lord Hanuman gone?

286
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,874
Where?

287
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,457
Hanumanji, it's your cue.
They're looking for you

288
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,874
Hanumanji!

289
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,207
Hanuman. Look at that

290
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,707

Balls of a wimp!
lt's not him either.

298
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:10,415
Aren't you an expert
at grabbing tails?

299
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,374
Carry on!

300
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:14,999
Whose phone is that?

301
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,790
Whose tail is ringing?

302
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,290

Roshan! l've found it

305
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,499
What species is he?

306
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,999
Hey, thanks a lot.
Thank you

307
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,665
Sir, l can't figure it out.
Let me go

308
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,040
Did l give you permission to stop?

309
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,249
Keep going

310
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:48,582
You don't have the right to
do that. What are you doing?

311
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,624
Who's this?
- Roshan, let's go

312
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,915
Shall l slap his left cheek too?

313
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,457
Know who l am?

314
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,290
No, no. One second

315
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,582
Your uniform tells me
you're a public servant

316
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,832
What? Balls of a wimp!

317
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,249
Do l look like a servant?

318
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,957
lnspector

319
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,915
lndia was surely the most
connected country in the world

320
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:22,082
Though not many express highways
but there are many shortcuts here.

321
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,582
He doesn't know the law here

322
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:29,957
There he is

323
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,874

This is lndia

327
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,707
You bow to a uniform. No choice

00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,790
Uncle Ali

329
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,874
How did you just pull that off?

330
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,832

331
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:01,624

332
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,832
Wrapped in a bank note

333
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,749

Hearts to your right

00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:40,915
This is not a city but
a gathering of lovers

You want 4x6? 5x7?
Laminated? What do you want?

360
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,249
You've wasted my whole day

361
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:27,332
l have beauty. l have heart.

362
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:33,832
A pretty face and l'm smart

363
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:38,832
l, Bittu Sharma, will
be your new lndian ldol

364
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,874
Was good, but loosen up!

365
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,290
Relax. Be a little sexy!

366
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,790
Hey mister, watch your step.

367
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:51,124
Tread carefully on the path of love

368
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:58,790
The path of love is strewn
with cheats

369
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:01,540
Hey mister, watch your step.

370
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:05,832
Tread carefully on
the path of love

371
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:12,457
The path of love is strewn
with cheats

372
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,749
Hey mister, watch your step.
- Not bad!

373
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,207
You forgot your lipstick today

374
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,999
No, l didn't. lt got rubbed off

375
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,374
When do my lips try that?

376
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:25,665
What?
- Your hair!

377
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,540
Your hands are too frisky.
Control them

378
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,707
They have a will of their own.
What a dirty mind!

379
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,207
Maybe they want something

380
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,624
Bittu, you never take me seriously

381
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,999
You'll appreciate me when
l make you the lndian ldol

382
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,915
Hello. lt's made in Paris

383
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,790
Not a bad photographer.

384
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:46,457
You can cover my wedding

385
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,499
They're in black and white.
No colour

386
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:51,499
l see life in black and white

387
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,790
But rainbows fill the Mumbai sky

388
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:58,499
Glamour. Fashion. Models! Money

389
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:00,499
l must make some money

390
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,999
But to make money you need money

391
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,749
Suresh!

392
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:10,749
Lalaji! Hello

393
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,457
What a coincidence!
l was coming to see you

394
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:15,999
Your meter is ticking, Suresh

395
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:19,290
You owe me 166,000 rupees

396
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,874
Didn't you get the cheque?

397
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,124
l'll clear our accounts at Diwali

398
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,249
You have a week

399
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,999
Or else l think you get it

400
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,249
Got it! You look smart today.

401
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:35,707
May l take a photo?

402
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,707
Say "ah"

403
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:53,915
Oh God!

404
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,082
Gran!

405
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:58,790
Rama is gifted.

406
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,457
She'll brighten her in-laws' home

407
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:02,915
Oh yes

408
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,624
l can see the lights

409
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,999
Her brothers' quarrelling is
spoiling her chances of marriage

410
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,957
Damn their bickering!

411
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,957
Soon she'll be too old to marry

412
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,415
Come on, Grandma

413
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,457
Age has nothing to
do with finding love

414
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:24,374
lt's all good, Aunt Rama.
Stay cool

415
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:39,790
When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me

416
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,540
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

417
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:47,165
When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me

418
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,999
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

419
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:55,082
l left my parents' home so
l could belong to my beloved

420
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:59,582
When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me

421
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,374
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

422
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:06,999
My husband is a merchant.
He is leaving for the city

423
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:11,957
When l see him go, my heart sinks

424
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,582
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

425
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:23,082
When mother-in-law taunts me,
brother-in-law consoles me

426
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,582
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

427
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:30,540
When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me

428
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,999
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

429
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:43,540
l left my parents' home so
l could belong to my beloved

430
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,790
Wearing a bush shirt,
he happily chews paan

431
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:53,999
There is no one to
match him in all of Raipur

432
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,790
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

433
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:01,415
When my beloved teases me,
sister-in-law ribs me

434
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,249
My husband's house is
as lovely as a marigold

435
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:20,540
l can't swallow a thing

436
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,499
Eating too many betel nuts!

437
00:32:22,583 --> 00:32:24,624
Who's there to stop you?

438
00:32:25,583 --> 00:32:26,999
Aren't you Rama?

439
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,665
Hello

440
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,290
Wow! You've never met us.
But you recognize us

441
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:37,249
The one and only Rajjo!

How do you do?
ls all well with you?

443

Your son is a gem

00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,915
He's one of us now

445
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,874
We're keeping him. Don't
say we didn't warn you!

Keep him! He's yours anyway

You have a Delhi-6 heart.

448
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,332
Tangy and spicy!
Like a Delhi snack

449
00:33:01,416 --> 00:33:02,749
Mother!

450
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,832

Tie this to her wrist

460

Lord Hanuman will cure her
- Hail Lord Hanuman

461
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,832
We won't let her fall sick

462
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,332
Get out of the way

463
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,332
Gobar, clear the way!

464
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:46,082
Get out of the way. Get out
of the way. - What's going on?

00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,915
Why have they stopped

Move them out of the way. Go on!

Go after them
- Give way. Give way

473
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:11,499
Clear the road. Clear the road

474
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:12,749
Clear the road

475
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:18,457
Move back - You're blessed
to see Mother Cow giving birth

476
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:22,165
Those who witness the birth
are freed of all misfortune Here!

477
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,082
Mother Cow has blessed you.
Have the sweet

Move back
- Please, clear the road

479
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,290
Can prayer ever be stopped?

480
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,790
Mother Cow is giving birth.
People have gathered

481
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:32,957
How can the police intervene?

482
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,082
Step back! Everyone stand back!
- What the hell!

483
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:35,957
There's an emergency case.
Clear the road!

484
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,290
Step back! Everyone stand back!
- Clear the road. Move! Move!

485
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:45,332
Gran?

486
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,999
Move! Move!

487
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,707
What are you all doing?

488
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,499
Move aside. Let us pass!

489
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:57,499
lt's having an effect.
lt's having an effect - Move aside!

490
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:02,624
Hail Mother Cow! Hail
Mother Cow! Hail Mother Cow!

491
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,165
Don't worry.

492
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,749
Her sugar level had
dropped and she fainted

493
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:10,624
Back in America, we thought Gran
had no one in Delhi

494
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:15,082
But everyone here is family

495
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,582
Roshan. You have it, Son

496
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:40,374
Gran is dying, Ali Uncle

497
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:45,874
The poet Zauq says: "Who can
ever wish to leave Delhi's lanes?"

498
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,249
Just stay

499
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,165
Stay as you are

500
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,415
You are pain

501
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,040
You are comfort

502
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,957
Just stay

503
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,749
Stay as you are

504
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,540
A gentle breeze

505
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,957
A stormy obsession

506
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,207
Smooth as silk.
Jagged as rough cloth

507
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,332
Sometimes you quarrel.

508
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:19,832
Sometimes you're stubborn

509
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,124
So full of fragrance

510
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:27,999
l don't want to change you an inch

511
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:31,457
Without adornment.
Without impurity.

512
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:34,040
No more. No less

513
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,082
l love you just as you are
- May l? - Sure!

514
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,249
lt's all yours

515
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:45,124
ln your rainfall,
l want to dissolve

516
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:51,290
l love you just as you are

517
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,332
ln your flame, l want
to burn and turn to ash

518
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:10,832
lf you wound me,
soothe me with a balm

519
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:17,582
l will soon love
the wound you inflict

520
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:30,582
You are a river.
Let me drown in you

521
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:36,332
Need a cold beer, boy?

522
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:42,457
Your father and l had a
great time when we were young

523
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,499
We had a great time

524
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,624
Ali Uncle,
you're a good-looking guy

525
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,249
Yes

526
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:58,290
No wife and children.
A girl-friend?

527
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:01,957
Just the one

528
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:04,249
And?

529
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,957
Your father took her away

530
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,874
My mother? Are you serious?
No way!

531
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:20,457
25 years ago, if l had
told Fatima "l love you"

532
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:24,707
l might have a son like you today

533
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,790
But dreams only blossomed
in my heart

534
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,874
Your father had guts

535
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:35,665
He loved her madly.
He fought everyone

536
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:40,207
Not caring what they saidabout
Fatima being a Muslim

537
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,082
He fought for love

538
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:47,749
When l look at you,
l see that love

539
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,290
ln your eyes and in the way
you talk

540
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,207
But then l know

541
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,582
..you will leave us too

542
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,040
Back to America

543
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,040
Ali Uncle, l'm an American

544
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:19,749
My life is there

545
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:33,207
All my pleas are written on my face

546
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:43,249
What can l ask of You, O Master?

547
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,457
You already know what
is in my heart

548
00:39:53,541 --> 00:40:02,374
O Master! My Master

549
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:07,915
O Master!

550
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:18,665
O Master! My Master

551
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:23,999
Cracks blemish
the line of my destiny

552
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:31,957
Repair my fate, O Master

553
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:38,040
l bow at Your door.
My being erased and then remade

554
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:45,207
Repair my fate, O Master

555
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:55,290
He who comes to Your
threshold comes to bow his head

556
00:40:55,375 --> 00:41:00,624
He drinks from the cup of ecstasy.
He dances in harmony

557
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:05,749
He came with throat parched.
And found an overflowing river

558
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:22,165
He returned bathed in
the shower of Your light

559
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:30,707
The rich always buy the
best urns. 501 . 95 paisa.

560
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:32,707
Just feel it

561
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:36,915
Do you have a gold urn?
With gems and rubies

562
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,124
Why show off in death?

563
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,749
Why save if you're going forever?

564
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,832
A copper urn.

565
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:47,124
251 . 95 paisa

566
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,249
l want a clay urn for
my ashes. Or l'm off

567
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,832
Yes, l have it

568
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:55,290
You're so old-fashioned.
Here you are

569
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:58,582
Specially made
from sacred Ganges clay

570
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:02,415
151 . 95 paisa
- This is good

571
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,707
Roshan, hold it

572
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,165
Now l can die in peace

573
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,832
Here you are

574
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:18,749
Only 100?
- You will prosper.

575
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,415
"The tree said to the leaf:
Listen to what l say:

576
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,749
"This is the cycle of life:
A leaf dies. Another is born"

577
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,499
Come on. l am done

578
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,582
l first thought it odd that Gran
was making these arrangements

579
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,290
A bit morbid

580
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,082
Who goes shopping
for your own funeral?

581
00:42:36,541 --> 00:42:37,665
Discussing death like this

582
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:42,999
Then l figured it out. We can't decide
the manner in which we are born

583
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,415
But we can plan our departure

584
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,040
The rainy season is over.

585
00:42:56,458 --> 00:43:00,624
Autumn is here

586
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:10,749
Yet l have had no word of Sita

587
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:21,124
lt pains Laxman to see
His brother suffering

588
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:31,457
He longs to take away his pain

589
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,332
Fresh attacks in Delhi 6

590
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,790
The dark shadow of the Black
Monkey is cast all over Delhi

591
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,999
Listen carefully
- My heart stopped when l saw it.

592
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,790
lt had bulbs on its chest

593
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:53,374
When l touched it,
l got a 500 volt shock!

594
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,499
Oh my God!

595
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:57,749
The earth gets
its energy from the sun

596
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:02,290
But the monster Black
Monkey's energy is far greater

597
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,249
lt can attack any time

598
00:44:04,333 --> 00:44:06,582
Hence beware and stay alert
- They're all fools

599
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,915
The Black Monkey
- lndia's space mission

600
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,999
lt tore her saree

601
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:14,749
Got love. Will make you an idol

602
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:17,249
The pride of lndia

603
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:20,457
The lndian ldol bus is
coming to your town!

604
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,665
Mumbai. Lucknow.
Kolkata, Delhi, Gwalior

605
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,999
lf you want to be an lndian
idol then call for the auditions

606
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:30,332
On 5052525. Or SMS ldol 52525

607
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,790
You pierced your navel?
- Sexy, eh?

608
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,207
Had it done yesterday

609
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:42,999
lt must have hurt
- Nothing is gained without pain

610
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:46,832
lf the Black Monkey has
glowing lights on its chest

611
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,207
it means it has a mother board

612
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:52,249
An electric circuit. Right?

613
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,540
Right
- Leave him alone

614
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,665
Don't bore him with your theories

615
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:01,499
Young man, what happens when water
gets into an electric circuit?

616
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:02,999
No, you tell me

617
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,874
Short-circuit?
- Right!

618
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,207
Well done! Hear that, Rajjo?

619
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:08,832
He's smarter than us

620
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,624
Made in America! Right?

621
00:45:12,041 --> 00:45:15,832
So, if you see the Black Monkey's
electric board, pour water on it

622
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,165
Short circuit! Finished!

623
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,457
The end of the Black Monkey. Right?

624
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:24,915
Brilliant.

625
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:26,790
lt's time to leave

626
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,665
l'm not blowing my own trumpet.

627
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,124
But no one can touch me
in electronics

628
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,874
Only father's old radio
is beyond me

629
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:41,540
Until l hear a sound from it,
l won't give up

630
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:44,957
Right

631
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:47,332
l'll see you at the prayer meeting
- Yes, yes. See you

632
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:49,332
All right. Bye
- Bye

633
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,457
Young man, good you're doing this.

634
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,999
The Goddess will rid
us of all problems

635
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,582
Hail to the Goddess!

636
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,999
Sister-in-law!

637
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,540
l don't know what he
was telling Roshan

638
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:12,249
Something about the Black Monkey's
mother sitting for a board exam

639
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,665
Pour water on him

640
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:18,165
He said pour water
on him and he's dead

641
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:22,499
But where do we get so much water?

642
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,332
lt's spicy
- Let Bobby play with me

643
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:30,665
Stop it!
- Bobby! - What are you doing?

644
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,624
Hello

645
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,457
Yes?

646
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,624
What is it?
- Here.

647
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,374
What is it?
- Some sweets

648
00:46:57,875 --> 00:46:59,915
Why? Has Mother Cow given birth?

649
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:04,457
No! Granny is well again.

650
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:06,332
So we're organizing
a prayer meeting

651
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:07,999
lt's an invitation

652
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:11,499
My hands are unwashed

653
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,999
Leave it inside

654
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,124
Yes

655
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:40,249
Sorry

656
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,415
You're the wife of
Madangopal Electrical.

657
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,874
How can you be so dumb?

658
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,999
You're from America, right?

659
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,540
Yes. For real. Why?

660
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,999
Lightning strikes when it rains?

661
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,332
Yes
- Yes?

662
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,624
Does lightning
short-circuit the clouds?

663
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:02,874
Never heard such a thing

664
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:04,540
Neither have l

665
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:08,290
Throwing water on the
Black Monkey won't help

666
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,415
Stop that damn racket!

667
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,290
Do you think the
Black Monkey is a moron?

668
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,665
A big hero, eh?

669
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,999
Talking rot to the women
- Uncle is right, father

670
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,999
My science teacher told
us about short circuits

671
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,957
Shut up! Son of an ass!

672
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,499
When you're my age, then talk big!

673
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:31,124
Must you shout in front of Roshan?

674
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,624
Mummy, l'm going out

675
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:36,915
Serve some lunch to Mrs. Mehra.
Then go to college

676
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,374
All right

677
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,915
See you at the prayer meeting
- Start

678
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,874
Bye

679
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:52,165
Pour water on the monkey? Ha!

680
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,790
Sorry about that

681
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,749
You Americans think you
own everything

682
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,499
You force your way everywhere.
lnto any country

683
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,957
So shameless.

684
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,124
You Americans never ask for permission
- So, now it's political?

685
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,749
Come on. What's the big deal?

686
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:16,374
lt's a big deal for us.
We never cross the line

687
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:21,790
You burger species!

688
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,582
You know why the Black
Monkey wears shades?

689
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:28,874
- How would l know?
- lt's stylish, boss!

690
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,207
You're smoking lndian
cigarettes when l'm around?

691
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,999
Try this, sir. lmported

692
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,790
Special filter

693
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,415
ls that so?

694
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,457
What a waste

695
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:44,832
Bobby, come here

696
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,332
Well, Mr Bobby?

697
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,957
You'll get 90%  in your
exams this time. Right?

698
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,707
No.100%

699
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:54,457
Bravo!

700
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:57,082
Pulling your uncle's leg! Right?

701
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,457
Who started this round?

702
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:03,665
Ok! There's a beggar
sitting round the corner

703
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:06,915
Give this to him. Good boy. Go

704
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,165
What are you doing?
- l'll do what l want

705
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,082
Shall we go in?

706
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:21,082
Those damn ghosts live there
- Go on!

707
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:24,374
You come too. Big mouth!

708
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,665
Mother!

709
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,540
Don't be a kid. We're grown up now

710
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:35,957
- What if we're caught?
- No one enters Dead Souls' Lane

711
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,332
They say scary ghosts roam here

712
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:40,457
Mummy says cigarettes are bad

713
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:41,999
But your father smokes.

714
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,499
You coward!

715
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,957
- l am not a coward
-That's more like it!

716
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,082
ln Delhi 6, Jalebi
helps boys become men

717
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,832
Jalebi?
The Untouchable caste sweeper?

718
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,832
- So what! - l'll ask Mummy

719
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:58,624
You son of an ass! You can't
ask Mummy about everything

720
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:00,165
Now we're men

721
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,957
Sister! The garbage

722
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:17,832
Old letch!

723
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:19,999
Here

724
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,082
Watch out!

725
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,999
Look good!

726
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:30,415
You girl thief!

727
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:33,165
You'll be dancing like a peacock
when l shove my broom

728
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:35,290
Move aside!

729
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:43,540
The garbage!

730
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:52,165
What are you doing?

731
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,582
Mrs. Mehra, the flowers

732
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,207
Go in

733
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:03,874
Simpleton!

734
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:10,999
You ask

735
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,832
Turn us into men

736
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,707
Who told you l can do that?

737
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:23,749
Everyone knows
- Sonny, you still wet your pants

738
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,749
Still drinking milk.
You'll be men, will you?

739
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,124
We're grown up. We want to be men

740
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,790
Run. l'll call your mother

741
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,999
Be men! You're toddlers

742
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:37,915
Damn it!

743
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:42,040
Wretched parents!
Spoiling their children

744
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,165
The garbage!

745
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,374
Oh, wait. Wait. Wait. l got that

746
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,999
Hold on

747
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,374
ln the name of Lord Ram! Disaster!
- What?

748
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,040
What have you done?

749
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,207
Come on, Gran

750
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,207
Gran. What are you doing?

751
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,624
You all cannot make me..
- Pure of body. Pure of spirit

752
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:11,582
Come on. Come on. Take
your clothes off -You wish!

753
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:15,915
So what if Jalebi is human!
She's of the Untouchable caste

754
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,832
You have to bathe.
Come on. Hurry up

755
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:20,249
Roshan, listen to him.

756
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,665
Do as l say, son

757
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:24,790
Get real, guys

758
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:31,332
Shabri, why do you hesitate?

759
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:35,082
Give me a berry to eat

760
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:41,082
She tastes the berries and
offers the sweetest to Lord Ram

761
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:47,624
Without hesitation, Lord
Ram eats berry after berry

762
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:51,082
Shabri is an Untouchable. Why is
He eating berries she has tasted?

763
00:53:51,166 --> 00:54:00,207
No one is inferior or
superior by birth to Lord Ram

764
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:04,290
Ramji is God. He is
permitted everything

765
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:08,999
No one is inferior or
superior by birth to Him

766
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,082
Rambihari

767
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:14,540
l need company.
Bring Jalebi to me

768
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,290
Hey, mom!

769
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,874
Yes. At the Ram Leela.

770
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:23,290
You guys!

771
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:25,457
The boss wants you

772
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:28,499
The Black Monkey? On CNN?

773
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,040
The key is here
- Didn't you hear me?

774
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:35,540
You damn sweeper! l'll fix you

775
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:36,707
Stand up!

776
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:38,874
l am not going with you

777
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,332
Tell him

778
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:43,499
Come on
- Let go of me!

779
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:47,040
May Ravan kidnap your sister

780
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,999
The police!
- Take right

781
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:51,040
Let go of me!

782
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,540
The Black Monkey?

783
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:01,790
He'll run over me!

784
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,540
All praise to you!

785
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:40,249
Where did the balls of the wimp go?

786
00:55:43,958 --> 00:55:45,040
Who?

787
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,749
The Black Monkey! Who else?

788
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,290
Not asking about your father

789
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,957
Pass me the fog horn!

790
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:56,124
You Black Monkey

791
00:55:56,958 --> 00:56:00,874
Your game is up. The
place is surrounded by police

792
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,915
Be reasonable. Or
else we will shoot you

793
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:09,624
Sir - Yes? - There.
l think he went up there

794
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:11,582
There

795
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:19,290
He tore through the roof
- He must have springs for feet

796
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,874
You saw him? What's he look like?

797
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:26,874
Who?

798
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:28,415
The Black Monkey! Who else?

799
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,332
Why are you winding us up?

800
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:31,707
What happened?

801
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:33,332
He was invisible, l didn't see

802
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:34,874
l understood

803
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:39,499
You understood? - lf he's invisible,
how can he be seen?

804
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,874
The moron drives well too!

805
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:44,082
Before l knew it

806
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:47,165
l was adding to the
Black Monkey's saga

807
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,290
What must be the height?

808
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:54,415
Because of me, now
he was invisible too

809
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,749
Click a snap. You idiot
- Yes. Yes

810
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:58,832
Move! Move!
- He's an alien

811
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,749
Sir, l.. - Call for the rope - Yes
- Criminal. Criminal. Criminal

812
00:57:03,416 --> 00:57:07,082
ln the dark of the night,
wearing a dark suit and dark glasses

813
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:09,540
the Black Monkey drives a black Sumo

814
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,249
Once its dark deeds are done

815
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:16,290
it presses a red button
- And becomes invisible!

816
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:17,665
lt's an alien

817
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,915
lt attacked two girls in
our area. They were sleeping

818
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,915
We gave chase. But it disappeared

819
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,915
This monkey is driving us crazy

820
00:57:27,166 --> 00:57:34,540
The albatross emits many
sounds while it is mating

821
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:43,624
lf you breathe deeply,
it'll benefit you in every way

822
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:46,999
Great importance is
given in Yoga to breathing

823
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:51,082
Chandrayaan is going to
be launched in some time

824
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,999
Our flag is on the moon now.

825
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,165
All over lndia, the preparations
to go to the moon..

826
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,457
Many Sumo cars
were destroyed in Delhi

827
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:00,707
But this Sumo belonged
to the Black Monkey.

828
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,874
He has made
everyone's life miserable

829
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:05,790
- Have you seen the Black Monkey?
- Yes! lt's invisible

830
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:08,249
lt is an animal.

831
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,790
Animals aren't in our jurisdiction

832
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:12,165
Not a case for us

833
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,374
A monkey? A criminal!

834
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,290
l will say it takes a lot
of precise manoeuvring there

835
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:21,457
But once it takes off,
then we know

836
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,707
The vehicle has lifted off!
The vehicle has lifted off!

837
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:27,124
The monkey is an animal.
Not our jurisdiction!

838
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:28,665
So? Will you do nothing?

839
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,124
Pointing fingers at us won't help

840
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,707
Look at our track record

841
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:36,749
We are most capable
- Utter rot!

842
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,707
This case is for
the Animal Ministry.

843
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,249
They must take action

844
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:44,040
Move! Go home and watch TV

845
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:47,332
Have you ever seen an
animal with a mother board?

846
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,332
Springs for feet?

847
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:53,332
No! So how does it
concern the Animal Ministry?

848
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:56,040
Talk to the Science
and Technology Ministry

849
00:58:56,125 --> 00:59:00,290
lf they stopped lining their
pockets, they'd have time for us

850
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,415
How right you are!

851
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:04,457
Madangopalji! lt's from the shrine

852
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,749
l'm Jaigopal! For
once get my name right

853
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:15,665
Look! Look into the mirror

854
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,457
ln every speck shines His light
- Should l come too?

855
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:21,415
Look within yourself,
He isn't far from you

856
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,707
lf you have love in you,
then embrace everyone

857
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,957
That's true worship

858
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,999
Look into the mirror!

859
00:59:30,541 --> 00:59:33,082
Salaams to you!
- Good morning, boys

860
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:35,374
Good morning, boys
- Good day, young man

861
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,707
Good day

862
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:42,290
He's a fine boy

863
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,165
Haji Mian!
- What is it, Mamdu?

864
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,332
Roshan slapped the
lnspector last night

865
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:54,415
"You public servant"

866
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,999
Yes
- "Do you know who l am?"

867
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,999
"Your uniform tells me
you're a public servant"

868
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,499
"Servant? Do l look like a servant?"

869
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,165
Then our Roshan, tall as
the Qutub Minar, his arm

870
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,915
Swings it around

871
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,874
No, no, no. No, sir

872
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:27,415
Did l give you
permission to stop? Carry on!

873
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,540
l explained. "Roshan is new in town"

874
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:36,082
The lnspector can fix anyone.
You don't know him

875
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,957
Don't talk too much

876
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:53,165
Masakali! Come

877
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:56,999
Come to me

878
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,665
Come here, my child. Come, sit

879
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:55,457
Masakali! Masakali!
Move a little. Move a little

880
01:01:55,541 --> 01:02:09,665
Masakali! Masakali! Move
a little. Move a little

881
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:12,165
Spread your wings
and set the dust free

882
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:14,665
Fly high! And higher still

883
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:18,999
Fly over cities, lanes and towns

884
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:21,832
Fly with grace on your wings.

885
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:24,582
Follow your heart's every desire

886
01:02:24,666 --> 01:02:26,665
Blend with the wind.
Stylish and swift.

887
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:29,374
Fly away, you gem

888
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:38,665
Masakali! Masakali!
Move a little. Move a little

889
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:05,624
A colony of clouds
is your lovely abode

890
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:10,832
Turn your head away
from those who can't fly

891
01:03:12,666 --> 01:03:14,749
Fly! Do not be afraid

892
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,415
Do as you please. As you please

Without warning
- Why does my heart quicken?

1064

Pearls over brimming
from the lips of oysters

Prose laced with poetry

1067
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:28,957
Sheltered under a sheet of
waves the ocean slumbers

1068
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:42,624
My eyes have been opened
wide by a flood of drunkenness

1069
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:49,999
Mesmerized.

1070
01:18:51,833 --> 01:19:01,332
How unaware you are

1071
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:04,249
Heart..

1072
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:36,999
My heart..

1073
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,332
No, Uncle

1074
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:48,832
Look! The Taj Mahal!

1075
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:53,749
The Taj Mahal is a symbol to love.

1076
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:57,540
Making mockery of
the love of the poor

1077
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:02,165
"Beloved, let us meet
in some other place"

1078
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,749
Nice! Let's go in

1079
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:41,082
My heart..

Your words are all l have

1114
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:03,249
What's up? How was the audition?

1115
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:05,540
Ok

1116
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,832
Just ok?

1117
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:16,124
Bittu.

1118
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,207
Life is full of highs and lows..

1119
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:22,082
lt's all part of the game.
You know, it happens

1120
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,165
l've been selected

1121
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,082
Really?

1122
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,832
Cool! Well done

1123
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,665
Why are you still looking so upset?

1124
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:34,790
l don't know

1125
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:41,832
You got what you always wanted.
Right?

1126
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:46,749
Right?

1127
01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:00,165
Her wings are tied. She can't fly

1128
01:25:01,291 --> 01:25:03,290
Masakali is father's favourite.
That's why

1129
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,124
Shall l free her?

1130
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,540
Wasn't one slap from
father Enough for you?

1131
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,999
l don't want to marry

1132
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:33,665
Then what do you want?

1133
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,957
l want to be an lndian ldol
- What?

1134

1135
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,374
That blasted TV!

They sent me a ticket.
l'm going to Mumbai

1137
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:49,957
Have you lost your mind?

1138
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:52,832
Get her married at once!

1139
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,999
Nothing but bad luck

1140
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:01,624
The girls in this family
of ours are so ill-fated

1141
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:15,999
You only think of yourself

1142
01:26:17,416 --> 01:26:19,082
Oh God! Why?

1143
01:26:19,166 --> 01:26:22,499
What else can l do? Spend
my life stuck here like you?

1144
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:27,207

1145
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:33,374
The stock market

A token of good will

1152
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:59,415
We're giving the boy a Honda

1153
01:26:59,791 --> 01:27:04,332
My boy can't be bought for a bike

1154
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:06,374
What are you saying?

1155
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,999
You thought l meant a motorbike?

1156
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:13,749

You choose the colour

1157
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:18,957
Sell or wait?

1158
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:23,249
And a Singapore honeymoon on us.
Sell!

Rajjo, see how lovely she looks

1169
01:28:13,708 --> 01:28:18,207
How time flies. Now she's of
age to marry and leave home

1170
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:21,124
Just look at her.

1171
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:25,207
Keep your father's honour

1172
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:04,874
The Black Monkey has struck again

1173
01:29:04,958 --> 01:29:08,415
lt has taken 20 kgs. of milk.
12 kgs. of sweets

How much cottage cheese?

15 kgs. Move it!
What are you doing?

Where were the police?

1178
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:22,040
At the police station!
How did we know it will attack?

1179
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:24,207
What will you do now?

1180
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:27,832
Everything is under control.
See for yourself.

1181
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:29,249
You can ask him for yourself.
Hey, Mamdu, tell them

1182
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:30,540
Talk to Mamdu

1183
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:33,582
Let's talk to the
shopkeeper whose shop was attacked

1184
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,999
Mamdu, how do you feel?

1185
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:39,457
Let him talk to Mamdu!

1186
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,999
The damn Black Monkey
is in our area

1187
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:47,040
And the police claim
they're controlling the situation

1188
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:52,832
Today it's Hina, the goat.
Tomorrow it might our women.

1189
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:56,540
Lalaji! Do you think
we're twiddling our thumbs?

1190
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:59,540
We'll take action too. Right?

1191
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:10,915
Long live Shani Baba!

1192
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:19,749
Shani Baba will fix everything. Ok?
- Ok?

1193
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:26,332
Side by side? Bad omen

1194
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:32,457
Really?

1195
01:30:33,083 --> 01:30:34,332
When?

1196
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,124
Then?

1197
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:38,290

Listen!

1203
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,999
Like songs on the radio.

1204
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,415
lmages on TV

1205
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,040
They float in the air

1206
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:05,040
Only one antenna can capture them

1207
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:10,332
ln the same way, monkeys' souls..

1208
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:13,499
..float about in the universe

1209
01:31:14,125 --> 01:31:16,999
Only Shani Baba can
communicate with them

1210
01:31:17,916 --> 01:31:21,040
Lord Hanuman has granted
this power to Shani Baba!

1211
01:31:21,125 --> 01:31:29,499
Lord Hanuman!
- May He live long!

1212
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,790
Okay

1213
01:31:33,375 --> 01:31:35,999
What? ls that the truth?

1214
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,082
Oh my God!

1215
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,540
Baba will fix everything. Ok!
- Shut up

1216
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:48,290
Three hundred and seventeen
years ago a temple stood here

1217
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:49,999
What are you saying?

1218
01:31:50,916 --> 01:31:53,124
Baba will fix everything. Ok!

1219
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:56,540
A curse! A terrible curse

1220
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:00,832
Listen..

1221
01:32:00,916 --> 01:32:06,624
The Black Monkey is the latest
Hindu plot to humiliate us Muslims

1222
01:32:07,041 --> 01:32:11,749
The Black Monkey
is creating mayhem.

1223
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:14,957
lt has wounded people.
And you call it a plot?

1224
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,249
Suleman Sahib..

1225
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:22,457
Why does the Black Monkey only
appear from Muslim neighbourhoods?

1226
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:25,165
What do you mean, Madangopalji?
- lt's Jaigopal

1227
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:28,415
Why are Hindu areas
the only ones attacked?

1228
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,832
And during
the Ram Leela performances?

1229
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:35,707
Hina was a Muslim goat!
l mean she belonged to a Muslim

1230
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:40,624
Suleman Sahib! But everyone
knows Mamdu prays to Lord Hanuman

1231
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:42,915
So wouldn't the Black Monkey know?

1232
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:46,457
The Black Monkey can't be a Muslim

1233
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:48,665
We have 1 00% proof

1234
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:52,082
Proof? What proof?

1235
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:56,582
Has anyone ever seen
a circumcised monkey?

1236
01:32:57,291 --> 01:32:59,457
l have heard of people
behaving like monkeys

1237
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:03,124
But a monkey being Hindu
or Muslim? That's a first!

1238
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:05,957
This is lndia, my boy! Play

1239
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:17,290
l want a strand of
the Black Monkey's hair

1240
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:19,165
The Black Monkey's hair!

1241
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:20,874
The Black Monkey's hair?

1242
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:24,790
You mean pulling it off
its body? Who will do that?

1243
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:27,874
We will!
- Shut up!

1244
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:29,874
Bring me its hair!

1245
01:33:30,416 --> 01:33:33,999
l will destroy it!
End of the menace

1246
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,624
End of the menace, ok!

1247
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:38,415
lt'll be destroyed! Ok

1248
01:33:38,583 --> 01:33:40,332
Destroyed! Ok

1249
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,999
Gobar will get the hair
- Gob..

1250
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:48,457
Brave Gobar!

1251
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:51,415
Why Gobar? Because he's an orphan?

1252
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,665
Let the fool be of some use

1253
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:56,415
He's smarter than you lot

1254
01:33:57,541 --> 01:33:58,957
Miss Know-All

1255
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:01,999
Gobar, come here

1256
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,040
Come on!
- Come on!

1257
01:34:04,125 --> 01:34:10,374
Want one ten-rupee note?
Or two one-rupee coins?

1258
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:14,207
Why one note? l'll take two coins

1259
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:18,707
Here, as you wish. That's
why he's the local idiot!

1260
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:27,457
The day l take the ten-rupee note,
the game is all over

1261
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:36,624
Look at her! Sniggering at us

1262
01:34:37,041 --> 01:34:41,082
So what if
l belong to a lower caste?

1263
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:43,290
l'm better than you

1264
01:34:43,375 --> 01:34:47,332
When you come to me at night,
no problem touching me, eh?

1265
01:34:47,416 --> 01:34:49,374
But in the daytime, l am
of a lower caste again!

1266
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:51,707
Speak up! ls a
pacifier blocking your tongue?

1267
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:53,290
Bastard!

1268
01:34:55,083 --> 01:34:57,082
l'll put a pacifier in your mouth

1269
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,124
What did you say?

1270
01:35:01,166 --> 01:35:04,957
The monkey makes you
pee in your pants.

1271
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:08,999
Get lost
- But you can hit a woman. Big man!

1272
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:10,874
Get lost!

1273
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:16,582
Brave Gobar!
- May he live long!

1274
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:20,749
To get rid of an ordinary
monkey prayers are being offered

1275
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:23,707
llliteracy may be the reason

1276
01:35:23,791 --> 01:35:26,957
We will hang the monkey and burn it

1277
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,624
The government does
nothing but chase votes

1278
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,582
The monkeys in the Ram Leela..

1279
01:35:31,666 --> 01:35:33,290
We'll kill it!

1280
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,332
Never was there a temple here

1281
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:46,874
Nor will there ever be one

1282
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,207
Nor will it ever be built here

1283
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:50,374
Their ancestors destroyed
the temple

1284
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:52,249
They'll have to pay the price

1285
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:53,832
All politics!

1286
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:56,415
Lord Hanuman's name
is being disgraced

1287
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,249
The monkey is a Muslim terrorist

1288
01:35:58,333 --> 01:36:00,874
We'll give them as good as we get

1289
01:36:00,958 --> 01:36:03,415
We've been attacked, sir
- You keep quiet

1290
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,374
lf you're stubborn..

1291
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:07,540
..you'll invite trouble. Right?

1292
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:09,874
How much more can we tolerate?

1293
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:12,374
Tension in Chandni
Chowk is at boiling point

1294
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:14,540
Push rites and rituals aside

1295
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,624
Look inside your homes

1296
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:20,707
Perhaps in some dark corner.
The Black Monkey lurks.

1297
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:21,874
So many veils in this world.

1298
01:36:21,958 --> 01:36:26,999
See the life in these lanes
Hiding behind layers and layers

1299
01:36:27,041 --> 01:36:29,040
Cloaks concealing cloaks

1300
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:31,124
Somewhere in the folds of the cloak

1301
01:36:31,208 --> 01:36:35,207
Pain is veiled. Wounds are hidden

1302
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:37,290
Secrets are trampled underfoot

1303
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,415
Aware yet how unaware we are

1304
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:43,499
Mad and innocent we are

1305
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,582
Who knows the colour
we're painted in

1306
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,957
ln the public bath, we are naked.

1307
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:50,457
We've no orders from above

1308
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:36,332
Mamdu!

1309
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:40,665
Close the door! Hurry!

1310
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,624
Jaigopal! Damn you

1311
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:49,665
Close the gates. Quickly

1312
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:53,165
Some sweets for you
- Mamdu

1313
01:37:53,791 --> 01:37:55,499
Some sweets for you

1314
01:37:57,916 --> 01:37:59,040
Mamdu, don't

1315
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:02,124
Some sweets for you
- No

1316
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:04,999
Don't you want more of my sweets?

1317
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:07,749
"Mamdu's shop is my shop"

1318
01:38:07,916 --> 01:38:10,540
Now try coming to me!
- Mamdu

1319
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:13,874
Try coming to my shop

1320
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:18,999
You spent half your life at my shop

1321
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:21,624
Mamdu, don't

1322
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:37,457
He demolished my shop

1323
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:42,499
Jaigopal believed my shop was his

1324
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:47,540
They spent half
their lives at my shop

1325
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:01,749
The Black Monkey is behind this.

1326
01:39:01,833 --> 01:39:04,124
The police are
offering a reward. 50.000.

1327
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:06,915
to catch the Black Monkey!

1328
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,707
Fifty-thousand?

1329
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:11,999
Catch the monkey.
And give the money to Lala

1330
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,999
That's how much he paid for me

1331
01:39:14,166 --> 01:39:16,082
My angel-face!

1332
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:19,540
l'll come with an
army of monkeys for you

1333
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:26,999
We'll catch him with the
help of a very big cage

1334
01:39:27,333 --> 01:39:28,749
The Black Monkey!

1335
01:39:28,833 --> 01:39:31,957
Lalalji! Save me

1336
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,874
Lalaji, save me. Lalaji,
Black Monkey. Save me, Lalaji

1337
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:40,249
Lalaji, black monkey,
save me. Save me, Lalaji

1338
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,249
Lalaji, black monkey. Lalaji,
black monkey

1339
01:39:43,333 --> 01:39:46,457
Lalaji, save me. Save me, Lalaji

1340
01:39:47,958 --> 01:39:49,665
Where is the Black Monkey?

1341
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:53,749
Catch the Black Monkey!

1342
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,665
You foreigner!

1343
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:14,040
ls it still 8 foot?
Or is it taller now?

1344
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:18,832
Springs under its feet?
Vanished, eh?

1345
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:21,332
lnto thin air?

1346
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:24,749
What?
- Don't glare at me!

1347
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,707
Lalaji's wife was almost raped.
You understand?

1348
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,624
Tell me..

1349
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:46,290
Whenever the Black Monkey attacks,
you're right there

1350
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,124
What's going on?

1351
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,874
Ask the monkey

1352
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:55,707
Monk..

1353
01:40:57,041 --> 01:40:58,499
What did he say?

1354
01:40:58,875 --> 01:41:02,749
Showing off his English
- ls that so?

1355
01:41:02,833 --> 01:41:04,249
Look at his arrogance!

1356
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:06,957
l'll sort him out

1357
01:41:07,333 --> 01:41:09,749
Bless you, son!
- Brother Roshan.

1358
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:15,124
Rama..

1359
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:23,707
Have a laddo. Go on!
Bittu is getting married

1360
01:41:23,916 --> 01:41:25,040
Rama, sweeten his mouth

1361
01:41:25,125 --> 01:41:28,665
They say if you bathe in the
Ganges you're blessed once

1362
01:41:28,875 --> 01:41:31,915
And a hundred times if you help the
family of a girl who is marrying

1363
01:41:32,083 --> 01:41:35,874
Tell us if there's you need anything

1364
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:44,999
"Cheese"

1365
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:48,332
l really think you should be firm

1366
01:41:48,666 --> 01:41:50,290
Why don't you just tell your father?

1367
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:52,582
A father's honour is
in his daughter's hands

1368
01:41:52,666 --> 01:41:54,957
Oh, come on, Bittu, get real!

1369
01:41:55,125 --> 01:41:57,790
You're talking about your
whole life. Don't be a fool!

1370
01:41:57,875 --> 01:42:00,582
Fool? Do l look like a fool to you?

1371
01:42:00,666 --> 01:42:01,874
lt's not what l meant

1372
01:42:01,958 --> 01:42:05,457
Bhisham Forget it.
You won't understand.

1373
01:42:06,125 --> 01:42:07,707
But Suresh does

1374
01:42:07,791 --> 01:42:09,499
Suresh?
- l'm going to Mumbai with him

1375
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,290
Have you gone insane?

1376
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:12,832
You know what he's all about

1377
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:15,124
Yes! But he cares about my dreams

1378
01:42:15,208 --> 01:42:17,582
ls this how you'll find yourself?

1379
01:42:17,666 --> 01:42:18,999
Great! Bittu

1380
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:21,999
l thought you'd put up a fight.
But you're running away

1381
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,374
You're being a coward

1382
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:25,332
Who are you to talk to me like this?

1383
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:32,999
Yeah, You're right

1384
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,749
Do whatever you want.

1385
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,749
You want to run from home?

1386
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:39,999
Good luck with that

1387
01:42:41,916 --> 01:42:43,540
Bittu..

1388
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:46,999
Bastard! Leading my daughter astray?

1389
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:48,957
Father..
- Your father's dead for you

1390
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,999
Take her downstairs! Go downstairs
- Come downstairs

1391
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:54,457
His family specializes
in eloping with girls

1392
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:57,957
Following your father's example, eh?
- Be quiet!

1393
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,665
Mr. Fifty-Fifty! Go,
before l lose my head. Out!

1394
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:04,999
What are you waiting for?

1395
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:06,915
Mother, l'm not speaking French

1396
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,874
Just ask Dad to book the
tickets and send them to me

1397
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:11,874
What's wrong, Roshan?
- Nothing

1398
01:43:12,041 --> 01:43:13,540
Something has happened

1399
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:17,165
Don't worry, son.
Leave everything to God

1400
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:19,499
Oh, great!

1401
01:43:22,583 --> 01:43:24,082
Which God?

1402
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:27,374
Whose God? Who should l leave it to?

1403
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,249
Leave it to mother's Allah?
Or Dad's Lord Ram?

1404
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:32,499
lt's really amazing, Gran

1405
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:35,040
Paint a stone red
and it becomes a god

1406
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:37,790
This plant of yours is a god too

1407
01:43:38,791 --> 01:43:43,165
But never solve your problems
yourself. Pray five times a day

1408
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:46,290
Ring a bell in a temple.
And leave everything to God

1409
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:48,457
We want to do nothing ourselves

1410
01:43:49,708 --> 01:43:51,499
lt's rubbish

1411
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:53,665
Don't say that.

1412
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:56,332
lt's our faith

1413
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:04,332
Whatever!

1414
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:07,332
But we're going back to America

1415
01:44:07,791 --> 01:44:09,582
Then why did you bring me here?

1416
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:14,999
Gran, l have made my decision
you're coming back with me

1417
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:18,665
Will you abandon your family
in America for these people?

1418
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:22,749
My ashes leave this place

1419
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:24,790
Stop behaving like a kid

1420
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:49,957
Sorry

1421
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,207
What's going on, Gran?

1422
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,832
l don't understand

1423
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:24,707
Everything will be all right

1424
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:26,749
Don't worry

1425
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:33,249
This is a fight for our rights

1426
01:45:33,416 --> 01:45:36,165
A fight for our self-respect

1427
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:38,957
A fight for our honour!

1428
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:41,124
We'll worship Goddess Durga here!

1429
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:43,249
Yes. We'll surely do it!

1430
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:44,790
We'll build a temple

1431
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:45,999
Say with me out, loud,
"We'll build a temple here"

1432
01:45:46,041 --> 01:45:48,332
We'll destroy our enemies

1433
01:45:48,500 --> 01:45:53,999
Fight in the name of God.
- Fight in the name of God.

1434
01:45:54,083 --> 01:45:56,290
We die. Or they die

1435
01:45:56,375 --> 01:45:59,082
Sorry, Annapurnaji.
- Hail!

1436
01:45:59,166 --> 01:46:02,290
He isn't allowed inside the temple

1437
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,040
Meaning?

1438
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,290
Blood is blood after all

1439
01:46:06,416 --> 01:46:09,332
Don't force me to talk!

1440
01:46:09,666 --> 01:46:10,999
This temple doesn't belong to you

1441
01:46:11,041 --> 01:46:13,207
Does it belong to
your father? You Muslim!

1442
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:20,582
Anyone who challenges
us will be destroyed!

1443
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:23,582
Let's go, Grandma. - Brothers, this
is the time of examination for us.

1444
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,915
We've picked up our weapons..

1445
01:46:27,208 --> 01:46:29,249
Roshan?

1446
01:46:34,083 --> 01:46:39,790
You're better off
listening to your elders

1447
01:46:40,458 --> 01:46:43,665
This is no party.
Too much tension here

1448
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,790
Granny! Make him see some sense

1449
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,957
He doesn't get it

1450
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:56,957
Have you ever wondered..

1451
01:46:59,541 --> 01:47:03,749
..what this good soul whom you
call a madman is trying to say?

1452
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:05,665
What can a mad fakir say?

1453
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:09,249
Why don't you go ahead and tell us?

1454
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:15,915
"ln every speck
shines His divine light

1455
01:47:17,458 --> 01:47:20,374
"Look within yourself.
He isn't far from you"

1456
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:26,332
He says everyone has
God's light within him

1457
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,999
A speck of Him

1458
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:32,707
lf we look within we will find Him

1459
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,415
Have you ever heard
that God hates someone?

1460
01:47:40,333 --> 01:47:41,707
l haven't

1461
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:43,957
(He is all about love)

1462
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:47,207
The boy has acquired a taste
for preaching. Listen to him!

1463
01:47:57,708 --> 01:47:59,040
Have a look

1464
01:48:00,791 --> 01:48:07,082
God is within us all

1465
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:10,999
Stop this nonsense!
Allah is the only God

1466
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:14,415
Look in the mirror, Mamdu

1467
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:15,999
Can you see your God?

1468
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:21,290
Get out of my way, otherwise,
l'll take care of you right here

1469
01:48:23,541 --> 01:48:25,999
Step back!

1470
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:30,415
Roshan says God is in everyone.
ln Gobar and this deaf-mute

1471
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:33,374
Garland him! Worship him!

1472
01:48:33,625 --> 01:48:37,332
My friend, wow. Amazing

1473
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,999
Now watch me! l'm
looking into the mirror

1474
01:48:40,333 --> 01:48:46,165
So that means l'm god too!

1475
01:48:46,875 --> 01:48:50,832
And l created the world.

1476
01:48:51,208 --> 01:48:54,332
l created the world!

1477
01:48:57,166 --> 01:49:01,624
Damn it! The world is broken.
lnto pieces!

1478
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:04,957
This world's in pieces
- Gather the pieces

1479
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:09,790
They've turned into animals

1480
01:49:12,041 --> 01:49:13,957
The devil is perched
on their shoulders

1481
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,790
They care for no one.

1482
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:19,790
And feel no shame

1483
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:24,332
Why did you have to
visit the temple now?

1484
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:29,999
Why did Roshan behave
so stubbornly?

1485
01:49:31,333 --> 01:49:33,290
We're unworthy

1486
01:49:33,583 --> 01:49:35,040
They showed their true colours

1487
01:49:35,666 --> 01:49:37,957
Delhi folk talk of
being large-hearted.

1488
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,999
This is what they have

1489
01:49:52,375 --> 01:49:55,957
l don't feel like dying here now

1490
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:10,707
Roshan. Take me back to America

1491
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:20,249
l was leaving..

1492
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:24,290
Father, l'm leaving home

1493
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:27,082
l was leaving.

1494
01:50:28,041 --> 01:50:29,790
Leaving this madness behind me

1495
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,165
l don't know what l want.

1496
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:35,957
But l know what l don't want

1497
01:50:38,291 --> 01:50:39,915
Away from Bittu

1498
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:44,707
And perhaps away from myself

1499
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:52,457
But l don't know
why l wanted to stay

1500
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:55,749
l wanted to mingle with them.

1501
01:50:55,833 --> 01:50:58,124
And embrace this madness.
Be part of it

1502
01:51:05,833 --> 01:51:09,415
Something was stopping me
from leaving

1503
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,665
Life is strange

1504
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:51,624
First Gran didn't want to go.

1505
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:54,499
Now l don't want to go

1506
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:58,082
You don't want to go?
Or never want to go?

1507
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:00,124
l never want to go

1508
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,957
Despite what happened yesterday?

1509
01:52:04,333 --> 01:52:05,915
Because of yesterday

1510
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,832
"This is a love that
isn't easy. Remember that!"

1511
01:52:10,791 --> 01:52:13,749
We lack food.
So we get by with love

1512
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:18,999
Our homes are small.
So we swear by large-heartedness

1513
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:22,665
A flute sound floats
through the tap. Not water

1514
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,207
You will regret it. Stay far away

1515
01:52:26,833 --> 01:52:28,207
How can l?

1516
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,499
These are my people

1517
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:34,707
Their virtues and goodness are mine

1518
01:52:35,625 --> 01:52:37,249
Their flaws are mine too

1519
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:40,165
You're over-emotional, Roshan

1520
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:41,999
No, Ali Uncle, no

1521
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:45,457
lndia works.
The people make it work

1522
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:49,165
People are good

1523
01:52:52,208 --> 01:52:56,790
My parents never admit it,
but they miss their life here

1524
01:52:59,166 --> 01:53:02,540
They try to recreate
this world in America

1525
01:53:04,458 --> 01:53:05,874
But when they open the window..

1526
01:53:07,291 --> 01:53:08,874
..unfamiliar air blows in

1527
01:53:09,541 --> 01:53:11,374
Deep thinking!

1528
01:53:21,541 --> 01:53:22,874
l love her

1529
01:53:26,250 --> 01:53:27,707
l love Bittu

1530
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:34,749
Can l tell you something?

1531
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:39,165
This house once belonged to Fatima

1532
01:53:41,083 --> 01:53:43,040
Your mother grew up here

1533
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,457
Before leaving, her family wanted
to sell the house. l bought it

1534
01:53:49,541 --> 01:53:50,915
Don't tell me

1535
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:53,915
Tell Bittu you love her

1536
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:58,665
Or you'll end up
buying empty houses like me

1537
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:04,040
Let your feelings out.
Must they burn inside you?

1538
01:54:22,708 --> 01:54:26,457
This is Delhi-Penal
Code 144 has been imposed

1539
01:54:26,541 --> 01:54:30,290
This is the shrine
where the trouble started

1540
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:35,249
Curfew has been imposed.
ls this the lull before the storm?

1541
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:40,749
Weapons were found behind this tree

1542
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,874
Risking my own life, Kumar
Kulshreshtha, is reporting to you..

1543
01:54:46,958 --> 01:54:48,624
This is the same area..

1544
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:50,832
Who gave you permission?

1545
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,665
Here's the capable
officer-in-charge, Ram Vijayji!

1546
01:54:55,750 --> 01:55:00,624
Uncle! Get the name right.
Thakur Ranvijay!

1547
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:02,374
Yes, Mr. Thakur Ranvijay.

1548
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:06,249
lf we had officers like
you in every neighbourhood..

1549
01:55:06,333 --> 01:55:08,249
lt's my duty
- Take his close up

1550
01:55:08,333 --> 01:55:09,582
Duty is duty.

1551
01:55:09,666 --> 01:55:13,124
Forget everything.
Duty is first come

1552
01:55:13,666 --> 01:55:16,374
Bring me a strand of the
Black Monkey's hair. Okay.

1553
01:55:16,666 --> 01:55:20,290
Don't be scared.
You are serving all mankind

1554
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:22,832
No
- Come on, you're very brave. Go

1555
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:25,124
Hey

1556
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:28,082
We're trying to explain it to you
as calmly as possible. Better obey

1557
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:30,374
Do as you are told.
Don't you understand?

1558
01:55:30,458 --> 01:55:33,082
Go!

1559
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:39,290
Well done! Keep moving

1560
01:55:42,416 --> 01:55:50,749
The dawn has broken. l wait for you

1561
01:55:52,083 --> 01:55:54,707
l wish l had your guts

1562
01:55:55,708 --> 01:55:58,040
Here's some money

1563
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:02,249
Go. Your dreams are waiting for you

1564
01:56:03,083 --> 01:56:04,582
Okay?

1565
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:15,040
The dawn has broken. l wait for you

1566
01:56:23,708 --> 01:56:26,999
Roshan, Suresh is at the shrine

1567
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:30,290
You oaf!

1568
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,874
What are you doing here?
- l have a lot of work, sir

1569
01:56:34,958 --> 01:56:36,165
What?

1570
01:56:36,250 --> 01:56:37,582
ls everything alright here?

1571
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:42,790
Take me for a moron, do you?
- Sorry, sir.

1572
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,540
l'm going home
- Move it!

1573
01:56:44,875 --> 01:56:46,540
Pissing in my ear!

1574
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,249
Brother Roshan

1575
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:51,832
Bittu has left home

1576
01:57:16,875 --> 01:57:19,999
Roshan brother, Suresh is
heading to Dark Souls' Lane

1577
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:34,415
What will happen now?

1578
01:57:36,125 --> 01:57:40,207
Let the final battle begin!

1579
01:57:40,541 --> 01:57:47,790
Good will win over Evil
today in the ultimate battle.

1580
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:52,332
Today is the day of
the great battle

1581
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:03,457
Hail Lord Ram!

1582
01:58:06,958 --> 01:58:10,290
Hail Lord Ram. Hail Lord Hanuman.
Hail Lord Shiva

1583
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,165
Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Ram

1584
01:58:12,250 --> 01:58:15,624
Let the final battle begin!

1585
01:58:15,708 --> 01:58:21,999
Good will win over
Evil today mahasangram..

1586
01:58:22,041 --> 01:58:30,332
..today mahasangram..

1587
01:58:30,625 --> 01:58:34,665
Hail Lord Ram!

1588
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:41,999
We call upon the Great Allah.
- We call upon the Great Allah.

1589
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:44,290
You morons.

1590
01:58:44,375 --> 01:58:49,082
Balls of a wimp! Look up there!
The Black Monkey!

1591
01:58:55,125 --> 01:58:57,957
Get him! The witch's son.

1592
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,540
Play cricket later.
Go and get the monkey

1593
01:59:00,625 --> 01:59:04,499
Come on, let's go.
Don't let him go today

1594
01:59:07,166 --> 01:59:09,457
lf you see the Black Monkey,
throw water on it

1595
01:59:09,541 --> 01:59:11,832
Come, let's guard the alleys

1596
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:13,624
Throw water!

1597
01:59:13,708 --> 01:59:15,957
Get water!

1598
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,540
Shani Baba! Go! Or else
the Black Monkey will get you

1599
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:50,790
Throw water!

1600
02:00:07,125 --> 02:00:08,874
The Black Monkey's hair

1601
02:00:10,333 --> 02:00:12,790
No harm in making fools of fools

1602
02:00:13,458 --> 02:00:14,665
Take it

1603
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,999
The Black Monkey is on our roof

1604
02:00:41,083 --> 02:00:42,665
Where's it?

1605
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:44,915
There! lt jumped from
the other terrace on ours.

1606
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,457
l saw its shadow
- Where is it?

1607
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:49,207
Mummy

1608
02:00:49,291 --> 02:00:52,165
Hey, kid fell down. Kid fell down

1609
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:56,415
Rajjo! The Black Monkey
threw Bhisham off the terrace

1610
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:57,999
Bhisham

1611
02:01:01,666 --> 02:01:05,124
Calls himself a father.
Can't look after his own son

1612
02:01:05,416 --> 02:01:07,874
Left him to the
mercy of the Black Monkey

1613
02:01:07,958 --> 02:01:11,957
Oh God..
- Call the doctor.

1614
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,665
Call the doctor!

1615
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:19,540
Mother Goddess! Save my nephew
- Please call a doctor

1616
02:01:19,708 --> 02:01:25,874
Don't lie.
We all have to go to God

1617
02:01:26,041 --> 02:01:32,415
Leaving our riches behind

1618
02:01:34,583 --> 02:01:37,707
O Lord Hanuman! Keep me safe

1619
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:43,249
O Protector of Lord Ram, save me

1620
02:01:48,166 --> 02:01:49,582
Lalaji!

1621
02:01:51,375 --> 02:01:55,790
Actually, the Black Monkey..

1622
02:01:56,041 --> 02:02:00,082
..is at the heart of
the whole problem

1623
02:02:01,375 --> 02:02:07,082
You're absolutely right, Haji Mian

1624
02:02:07,625 --> 02:02:09,499
One minute.

1625
02:02:09,958 --> 02:02:11,457
l'll go with you

1626
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:14,290
Look at this commotion

1627
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:17,540
Beware! The Black Monkey isn't far

1628
02:02:21,791 --> 02:02:24,124
Come here. Come here

1629
02:02:24,583 --> 02:02:27,207
l told you to throw water on it

1630
02:02:28,708 --> 02:02:30,457
Make him see sense!

1631
02:02:33,208 --> 02:02:35,332
All this is because
of the black monkey.

1632
02:02:35,416 --> 02:02:38,582
l warned you!
- Don't worry, brother.

1633
02:02:39,166 --> 02:02:40,665
Everything will be all right

1634
02:02:41,416 --> 02:02:45,374
To save face in the community..

1635
02:02:45,583 --> 02:02:48,415
..we'll say the Black
Monkey kidnapped Bittu

1636
02:02:49,125 --> 02:02:51,540
lt will shut them up. Right?

1637
02:02:57,583 --> 02:02:59,290
Bittu! Where are you?

1638
02:03:00,375 --> 02:03:01,582
You sure you have the tickets?

1639
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:03,624
l checked them four times

1640
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:06,540
l landed in trouble.
l had to slap the lnspector

1641
02:03:06,625 --> 02:03:08,957
Stop bragging! Let's go
- Let's go

1642
02:03:11,041 --> 02:03:12,832
What is it? Hurry!

1643
02:03:14,916 --> 02:03:16,290
Suresh!

1644
02:03:21,375 --> 02:03:23,707
Let go off me!

1645
02:03:23,791 --> 02:03:26,374
Black Monkey

1646
02:03:32,041 --> 02:03:35,457
Calm down. lt's me

1647
02:03:37,416 --> 02:03:39,040
lt's just me

1648
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:43,957
Oh God..

1649
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:45,290
You!

1650
02:03:45,916 --> 02:03:49,124
What have you done?
Why did you need to do this?

1651
02:03:49,333 --> 02:03:52,124
l had almost escaped
- With the great Suresh?

1652
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:54,457
He ran and left you at
the Black Monkey's mercy

1653
02:03:54,541 --> 02:03:56,457
You're leaving me too. For America

1654
02:03:56,541 --> 02:03:58,415
What you talking about? Never

1655
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:13,290
l love you, Bittu

1656
02:04:16,833 --> 02:04:18,874
l'm incomplete without you

1657
02:04:23,208 --> 02:04:24,790
l'll never leave you

1658
02:04:29,416 --> 02:04:31,707
l thought you'd never say it

1659
02:04:39,916 --> 02:04:41,290
Hey, it's..

1660
02:04:44,583 --> 02:04:46,457
Roshan
- Brother Roshan

1661
02:04:51,166 --> 02:04:53,874
Balls of wimp! You've been
messing us around for days

1662
02:04:54,333 --> 02:05:00,165
Hit him!
- Let him go!

1663
02:05:02,791 --> 02:05:04,249
Don't hit him!

1664
02:05:04,791 --> 02:05:06,540
Hit him!

1665
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:08,707
Don't hit him!

1666
02:05:12,875 --> 02:05:16,040
Hit him!

1667
02:05:16,875 --> 02:05:18,499
Don't hit him!

1668
02:05:18,583 --> 02:05:20,207
Hit him!

1669
02:05:20,291 --> 02:05:21,999
Don't hit him!

1670
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:25,457
He isn't the Black Monkey.

1671
02:06:20,916 --> 02:06:22,540
You disgraced us

1672
02:06:22,791 --> 02:06:26,457
Father, stop them!
- Shut up!

1673
02:06:26,916 --> 02:06:29,874
Jaigopal! Beat him to a pulp!

1674
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:38,249
You scumbag. You wretch

1675
02:06:42,625 --> 02:06:45,707
Creating nothing but trouble

1676
02:06:51,166 --> 02:06:52,499
The Black Monkey

1677
02:06:53,666 --> 02:06:55,332
He isn't black monkey.

1678
02:06:55,416 --> 02:06:57,707
You can't be the Black Monkey
just by wearing a two-penny suit

1679
02:06:57,791 --> 02:06:59,207
How is it possible?

1680
02:07:00,708 --> 02:07:03,249
Here is the Black Monkey's hair

1681
02:07:03,583 --> 02:07:08,665
Shani Babi will fix everything, ok!

1682
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,957
The Black Monkey

1683
02:07:34,625 --> 02:07:36,040
Roshan

1684
02:08:01,666 --> 02:08:03,040
You killed him?

1685
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:07,582
Bravo!

1686
02:08:08,375 --> 02:08:13,374
You would've killed each other if
he hadn't posed as the Black Monkey

1687
02:08:32,291 --> 02:08:35,624
The Black Monkey is laughing at us

1688
02:08:39,333 --> 02:08:41,040
lt isn't dead

1689
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,999
lt is sitting inside us

1690
02:08:48,458 --> 02:08:51,207
ln some dark corner
ln every one of us

1691
02:08:53,458 --> 02:08:55,249
Laughing at us

1692
02:09:08,125 --> 02:09:11,832
The Black Monkey killed Roshan

1693
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:17,499
Oh..

1694
02:09:21,458 --> 02:09:25,082
He pretended to be the
monkey out of love for us

1695
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:27,957
Out of love for Bittu

1696
02:09:37,166 --> 02:09:38,915
Call an ambulance!

1697
02:10:01,875 --> 02:10:03,665
l feel so sorry for Mamdu

1698
02:10:18,541 --> 02:10:20,915
Mamdu is just like his father.

1699
02:10:21,708 --> 02:10:23,707
Too much sugar in his sweets

1700
02:10:23,958 --> 02:10:27,957
Grandad! Why bother
how sweet sweets are?

1701
02:10:31,041 --> 02:10:33,999
We Delhi folk didn't treat you right

1702
02:10:37,125 --> 02:10:38,832
Not at all

1703
02:10:39,416 --> 02:10:41,999
They're all good-hearted people

1704
02:10:42,041 --> 02:10:45,624
No, the devil is
perched on their shoulders

1705
02:10:46,750 --> 02:10:48,874
Not the devil. A monkey

1706
02:11:01,083 --> 02:11:03,749
My Black Monkey stayed within me

1707
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:12,540
lf only l could
apologize to your mother

1708
02:11:16,708 --> 02:11:18,290
Do it now

1709
02:11:18,625 --> 02:11:21,499
You know give her a call.
Sort it out

1710
02:11:23,291 --> 02:11:25,332
Call her! Hold on

1711
02:11:36,708 --> 02:11:41,749
Cracks blemish the line
of my destiny

1712
02:11:41,833 --> 02:11:49,124
Repair my fate, O Master

1713
02:11:49,333 --> 02:11:54,374
l bow at Your door.
My being erased and then remade

1714
02:11:54,458 --> 02:12:01,707
Repair my fate, O Master

1715
02:12:02,583 --> 02:12:04,540
Be careful..

1716
02:12:04,708 --> 02:12:06,374
Start driving!

1717
02:12:07,125 --> 02:12:08,999
What's wrong?

1718
02:12:09,625 --> 02:12:12,832
Give it a push - What's wrong
with the car? - Come on

1719
02:12:13,083 --> 02:12:14,624
What's wrong?

1720
02:12:17,125 --> 02:12:18,749
Please move aside

1721
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,207
What happened?

1722
02:12:20,291 --> 02:12:22,457
3.. 4.. 5.. The injection!

1723
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:25,499
1 .. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5

1724
02:12:27,208 --> 02:12:28,707
Roshan

1725
02:12:36,625 --> 02:12:37,957
1 .. 2..

1726
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:40,249
Roshan

1727
02:12:41,416 --> 02:12:42,790
Roshan!

1728
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:46,707
He's gone

1729
02:12:46,791 --> 02:12:48,457
What do you mean?
Gone? Do something

1730
02:12:48,541 --> 02:12:52,749
Do something. Roshan
- What're you doing? Stop it

1731
02:12:52,833 --> 02:12:54,915
Don't do it! No!

1732
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:56,999
Roshan

1733
02:13:14,125 --> 02:13:15,624
We'll meet again

1734
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:24,082
He's come back. Roshan's conscious
- Grandma

1735
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:29,374
Grandma

1736
02:13:37,333 --> 02:13:39,999
Hail Lord Hanuman

1737
02:13:50,666 --> 02:13:53,665
You'll be all right. You'll be ok

1738
02:14:00,750 --> 02:14:05,540
"Who can ever wish to
leave Delhi's lanes?"

1739
02:14:50,666 --> 02:14:52,957
Gobar was so right

1740
02:14:54,583 --> 02:14:59,207
The Black Monkey or something
like it is within all of us

1741
02:15:00,791 --> 02:15:04,749
Whenever there is anger and hatred..

1742
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:07,999
..the monkey becomes more powerful

1743
02:15:09,125 --> 02:15:12,874
And then we start using
it to our own advantage

1744
02:15:14,333 --> 02:15:17,207
But instead of destroying
the Black Monkey within us?

1745
02:15:17,541 --> 02:15:19,374
we kill each other

1746
02:15:27,791 --> 02:15:30,499
The Black Monkey turned to
ashes like the demon Ravan

1747
02:15:32,666 --> 02:15:34,457
As for me..

1748
02:15:36,083 --> 02:15:37,665
l came back home

1749
02:15:55,708 --> 02:16:04,832
A scent would fill my breath

1750
02:16:04,916 --> 02:16:09,374
l'd lose my way

1751
02:16:09,708 --> 02:16:14,832
lt was a web of silk..

1752
02:16:14,916 --> 02:16:20,624
..and l'd stare it in its eyes.

1753
02:16:21,791 --> 02:16:31,999
Truth was apparent when
l stepped in your alley

1754
02:16:32,041 --> 02:16:37,040
The scent was within me..

1755
02:16:37,291 --> 02:16:42,665
..that you unveiled to me

1756
02:16:42,833 --> 02:16:47,832
O Master! My Master

1757
02:16:47,916 --> 02:16:52,832
O Master!

1758
02:16:53,041 --> 02:16:57,999
O Master! My Master

1759
02:16:58,041 --> 02:17:03,082
Cracks blemish
the line of my destiny

1760
02:17:03,166 --> 02:17:10,957
Repair my fate, O Master

1761
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,999
Even l'd raised my head in
anticipation at your doorstep

1762
02:17:19,291 --> 02:17:24,707
l'd dreamed a lot and tried a lot

1763
02:17:25,666 --> 02:17:28,582
When l came across you

1764
02:17:32,041 --> 02:17:36,915
When l came across you,
l met your eyes

1765
02:17:37,208 --> 02:17:40,832
ln a moment while l bowed

1766
02:17:42,333 --> 02:17:46,999
ln a moment while l bowed,
l got my every wish

1767
02:17:47,083 --> 02:17:57,290
O Master! My Master

1768
02:17:57,375 --> 02:18:07,415
O Master!

1769
02:18:07,500 --> 02:18:12,499
Cracks blemish
the line of my destiny

1770
02:18:12,583 --> 02:18:17,457
Repair my fate, O Master

1771
