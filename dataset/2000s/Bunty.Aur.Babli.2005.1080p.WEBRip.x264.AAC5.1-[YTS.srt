1
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:03,004
This is India..

2
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:05,805
the land that glistens, shines..

3
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:09,307
..the land bedecked with
the glitter of dreams..

4
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:12,429
..beckoning you..

5
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,931
if you nurse a hunger,
she says, here..

6
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:17,102
you'll find what
satisfies it. Come..

7
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:18,973
rub your shoulders.
till they're blue..

8
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:20,564
with fame, wealth, power, glory..

9
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:22,435
..and your life becomes..

10
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:25,267
..a sunlit dream you
never want to wake out of

11
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:31,611
Yes, this is India.. a dream..

12
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,483
..that Bunty and Babli
dreamt every night of their lives

13
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:39,656
And this is the India they live in..

14
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,157
..an India that says..

15
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:44,619
your dreams should end
where your arms do..

16
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,411
and you should feel only as
much hunger as you can satisfy..

17
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,622
step forward..

18
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,334
but only when. you're in
step with the others..

19
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:56,246
float to the top but not
at the cost of anyone else

20
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:58,958
love, compassion, honesty, respect..

21
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:00,839
..are what matter most..

22
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,922
this too is India..

23
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:10,345
the India Bunty and Babli grew up in

24
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,217
but didn't feel
like they belonged to

25
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:18,140
This world we live in
has two kinds of people

26
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:22,352
One, the kind that does just
one thing all their lives and..

27
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,303
the kind that does..

28
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,854
..just about everything in one life

29
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:30,227
I didn't say that, they did and they
didn't just say it, they lived it

30
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,358
And how! No one ever lived life..

31
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,019
..like they lived
theirs and perhaps..

32
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,771
..no one ever will

33
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:40,403
So much excitement.. so
much adventure, so many joys..

34
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:42,735
..all in one single lifetime..

35
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:47,568
no one could have imagined
it possible, not even them.

36
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,660
Or then again maybe they could have

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,923
Small town cocoons
These dull afternoons..

38
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:16,135
I want to pack them up
and go away.. away..

39
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:22,549
The rains come slow
The river lies low..

40
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,592
The sea will carry me away

41
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,975
Small town cocoons
These dull afternoons..

42
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:35,267
I want to pack them up
and go away.. away..

43
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:39,480
The rains come slow
The river lies low..

44
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,192
The sea will carry me away

45
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:52,488
Going away, I'm going
away Oh Ram Chand re..

46
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:56,490
Dhadak'dhadak
Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow

47
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,743
Dhadak'dhadak
Dhadak'dhadak Hear the whistle blow

48
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:05,166
Dhadak'dhadak
Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow

49
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:09,958
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Call me, oh, watch me go..

50
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:43,229
Stand aside, make way for me
Those clouds are mine to hold

51
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:50,944
Burnt in black on a white sheet sky
I'll write my name, big and bold

52
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,986
On the street that
curves around the moon..

53
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:59,319
At the bend is where I'll stay

54
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:08,154
On the street that curves around
the moon I'll stay far, far away

55
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:16,579
Going away, I'm going
away Oh Ram Chand re..

56
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,962
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Watch the smoke billow

57
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:25,085
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Hear the whistle blow

58
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:29,467
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Watch the smoke billow

59
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:33,920
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Call me, oh, watch me go..

60
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:06,860
Small town cocoons
These dull afternoons

61
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,073
I want to pack them up
and go away.. away..

62
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:15,326
Small town cocoons
These dull afternoons..

63
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:19,448
I want to pack them up
and go away.. away..

64
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:23,701
The rains come slow
The river lies low..

65
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:27,253
The sea will carry me away

66
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:36,959
Going away, I'm going
away Oh Ram Chand re..

67
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:40,961
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Watch the smoke billow

68
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:45,264
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Hear the whistle blow

69
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:49,387
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Watch the smoke billow

70
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:54,219
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Call me, oh, watch me go..

71
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,032
When I ride l carry in my hair..

72
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:18,905
The cool whispers of the wind

73
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:26,789
Ride across the earth, the sky
Leave the world behind, unhinged

74
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,832
My forehead adorned, my jewel,

75
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:35,165
the moon I can't walk
unnoticed amidst the stars

76
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:43,840
moon I can't live
unnoticed up here with stars

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:52,805
Going away, I'm going
away Oh Ram Chand re..

78
00:07:52,886 --> 00:08:01,011
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Watch the smoke billow

79
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,313
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Hear the whistle blow

80
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:10,066
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak
Call me, oh, watch me go..

81
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:29,368
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak

82
00:08:30,699 --> 00:09:05,550
Call me, oh, watch me go..

83
00:09:08,932 --> 00:09:10,853
It's not going to come.
- It will

84
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,355
It won't.
- It will

85
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:16,897
Boy, go down to the
tap and have your bath

86
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,358
Or you'll be standing at
the end of a very long line

87
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,191
No dearth of people
wanting to get into a line

88
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,442
What do you mean?
- What I mean Ma is..

89
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:31,316
this world has two kinds of people,
one, those who line up before taps..

90
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:33,658
and two, those who make themselves..

91
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:35,319
..taps so they won't
need to stand in any line

92
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,661
I happen to belong to the latter.
- You don't belong anywhere

93
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,662
You've already spent forty
rupees on this gibberish

94
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:45,495
How much more will you blow up?
- Ma, how many times do I tell you..

95
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:48,417
I'm not spending anything.
This is an investment

96
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:52,039
For fifty bucks, this shower is up
and running.. then l'll fix it..

97
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,290
..to the community tap and everyone's
willing to part with fifty paise..

98
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,673
..to bathe in a shower. If five
people use it everyday, that's 2.50

99
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:02,175
In twenty days, fifty bucks are back

100
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:05,507
That's 2.50 in profits
everyday from each shower

101
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:07,839
Stop. You're making my head spin

102
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,893
The problem with this Fursatganj,
talking sense sends heads spinning

103
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:18,805
Anyway, do you
remember my chit fund idea?

104
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:21,397
A finance company in Lucknow..
- I don't want to know anything!

105
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:25,349
If you don't stop now you'll
surely go to jail some day

106
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,066
There.. l told you it'll come

107
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,528
Of course it will. Why won't it?

108
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:41,489
How else will he drown his future?

109
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:48,073
Why.. oh today was your interview
for the railway job! You didn't go?

110
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:51,575
I went! Pandey'ji
called to say that..

111
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,417
before I recommend my
son for another interview..

112
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,248
..I should at least make sure

113
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,330
that he drags himself
there on his own two legs

114
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,001
I've lain my' five years
in the service on the line..

115
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:04,083
..and made him agree for
another chance tomorrow

116
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:07,215
Thank God he agreed

117
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:12,879
How does that matter?
I need to agree too

118
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:16,841
Rakesh, we're trying
to be serious here

119
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,972
I told him I don't want
to be a ticket collector

120
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:23,265
So what do you want to be? The
maker of failed schemes, for life?

121
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:26,807
All of Fursatganj thinks
you're a deluded Don Quixote

122
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:29,389
You want them to coin new
euphemisms for you? Everyone..

123
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,730
Fursatganj is packed with asses.

124
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:34,442
And all asses can do is..

125
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,313
..chew the cud and bear the burden.

126
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,315
I wasn't born to do either

127
00:11:40,906 --> 00:11:43,487
Oh you'll become a
Birla-Tata-Ambani? - Why can't l be?

128
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:48,030
They didn't fall out of the sky. They
too were born here on this earth

129
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,451
At least they were born here.

130
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,362
You belong to a
different planet altogether!

131
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:56,405
Dad, don't get me started again.
I've made up my mind

132
00:11:56,495 --> 00:11:59,657
I'm not going to waste my
entire life trapped in a job

133
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:00,828
Look here

134
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,579
I've spent thirty
five years in this job..

135
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:05,211
..You think my
life's been a total waste?

136
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,757
After a lifetime of service,
does the government even bother..

137
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:20,420
about your opinion?
After thirty five years of..

138
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,632
shuttling up and down that same train
route, does even one passenger..

139
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,973
from all those
thousand trips remember..

140
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,725
..what you look like
in your shabby coat?

141
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:34,269
When you die, will anybody
except Ma and I, shed a single tear?

142
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,270
Will the railways take a day off?

143
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:40,813
Dad your life means nothing.

144
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,275
There's no respect,
no fun, no meaning

145
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:58,033
When I walk wearing this shabby coat,
that seems to embarrass you so much..

146
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:04,447
..people stop in their
tracks to pay me their respects

147
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:12,502
Shopkeepers are up on their feet
to attend to Mr. Ticket Collector

148
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:21,758
Why? Because my poor
black cotton coat..

149
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:29,462
is untainted by ill-gotten gain

150
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,926
it is the mark of my esteem

151
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:39,889
Rakesh..

152
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,061
the interview is at 9
o'clock tomorrow morning

153
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:48,644
Get there in time. Or get lost

154
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:55,188
Find a meaning for your life wherever
you want, however you want to

155
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:02,903
Because we can't live up
to your high expectations..

156
00:14:07,996 --> 00:14:09,617
we're sorry

157
00:14:35,963 --> 00:14:37,464
There's something about you baby

158
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:39,466
You too

159
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,057
You're not half bad either

160
00:14:42,557 --> 00:14:44,559
Go easy on the lipstick..

161
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,811
it shouldn't look too tacky.
And one thing you ought to know

162
00:14:48,891 --> 00:14:52,564
A ragged skirt doesn't make you sexy

163
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:57,817
It's what's in your eyes..
like in mine.

164
00:14:58,437 --> 00:14:59,568
Dear God..

165
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,190
my daughter has gone insane!
- If worshipping my beauty..

166
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,573
..is tantamount to being insane,
then I plead insanity

167
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:12,156
If craving for fame is
insane then I plead insanity

168
00:15:12,406 --> 00:15:14,577
If the desire to renounce
this pigeon-hole Pankinagar..

169
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:18,700
..for the great wide
marvellous world outside is insane..

170
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,912
then I plead complete insanity

171
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,084
And you are driving me nuts.
Take off that shirt

172
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:29,126
I'm sorry, I don't believe
beauty needs cheap exposure

173
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,748
One tight slap and all
your beliefs will change

174
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:34,339
You've ruined all his best shirts

175
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:40,343
Ruined? These shirts will fetch
millions. There'll be grand auctions

176
00:15:40,423 --> 00:15:45,216
Supermodel Vimmi's shirts! The ones
she wore when she dreamt of success

177
00:15:45,506 --> 00:15:52,350
Ladies and gents, do I hear a
hundred thousand.. One.. Two.. Three!

178
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,262
Jassi, where's my shirt?

179
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:56,353
Right here..

180
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:00,185
What's she up to now?
- She's just fooling around..

181
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:03,557
Fooling around? Go on,
enjoy yourself..

182
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:06,109
till the time you can

183
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,023
What are you trying to do?
- Trying to be coy about my marriage

184
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:14,944
But doesn't seem to be
coming too naturally

185
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,657
Your father isn't joking. You
won't find a man like Surinder..

186
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:22,739
..even if you turn Kanpur and Lucknow
inside out. Count your blessings..

187
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:24,740
..a head clerk has
fallen into your lap that..

188
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,822
..too in a place like Pankinagar

189
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:30,744
Papa'ji, I think..
I'll run away from home

190
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:33,706
Listen to her!

191
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:36,788
I kept telling you we
shouldn't allow cable tv in her room

192
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:39,379
All day-and-nights she's whispering
to those naked witches on her walls

193
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,632
And now she even wants to run away.
- No harm in that, no?

194
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:48,135
You go ahead, run away

195
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:53,048
But see, it's 1 1 o'clock.
Eat lunch before running

196
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:55,469
What are you saying?
- I don't want a weight on my mind..

197
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,841
..my daughter running
away on an empty stomach?

198
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,182
I'm warning you,
I'll really run away..

199
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,093
..if you even think
of marrying me off..

200
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:04,645
to that.. that ten out of ten!
- Ten out of ten?

201
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:05,936
That ass always got ten out of..

202
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:08,227
..ten in every
godforsaken subject.. what a nerd

203
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:14,021
Who wouldn't want to marry such a
man? - Then why don't you? Spare me

204
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:18,773
Now get out of that outfit and
help your mother with the cooking

205
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:23,406
I've called them to lunch tomorrow

206
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:27,779
I want things to be finalised before
the evening tea hits the table

207
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,412
Enough. Don't make me hurt you

208
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:53,005
Why are you taking them off?
- You don't know why?

209
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:58,628
It's time you realised that you
can't live like you want to anymore..

210
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:02,260
..You'll have to adjust
to your new family's ways

211
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,344
You'll eat, drink, walk,
sleep the way they want you to

212
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:16,019
Look, l'm your mother. All
I want is to see you happy

213
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:20,391
Forget all of this

214
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:28,606
You're leaving this for a new world.
- It feels like I'm leaving the world

215
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:34,650
The more you think about it,
the more you'll hurt

216
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,453
Just do as I say.
You'll learn to be happy

217
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:49,119
Mummy, if I request Papa'ji
not to marry me offjust yet..

218
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:50,710
..will he listen?

219
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:58,045
The facial cream is on the
washbasin. Don't forget to apply it

220
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:25,231
Tea.. piping hot tea..

221
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:28,643
A little extra milk
never killed a cow. - Sir?

222
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:32,025
I said, two extra
teaspoonfuls of milk never killed..

223
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,987
..the calf's mother. Pour

224
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,899
There's more milk than water in it,
sir. - More milk, I said..

225
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:39,280
..Hey give back my glass

226
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,573
Catch it if you can

227
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,081
Your name sir? - I'm what
you'd call Raj Kapoor Tiwari

228
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:06,086
Where's your seat here, show me..

229
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,919
I'm not on your list..
the other one.

230
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:15,512
I talked to the
ticket checker, paid him

231
00:20:16,973 --> 00:20:20,055
Oh, so you've paid him a bribe

232
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:22,516
No, no..
- Give me your address

233
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:25,308
Why do you need my address?

234
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,679
Do you see that berth number?

235
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,681
Take a look.
- Number seven

236
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:32,813
Coach FC 1, berth number 7

237
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:34,974
Always reserved for..

238
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:38,686
the Fursatganj staff
going to Lucknow. I've been..

239
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,818
..using this berth for 3 years

240
00:20:41,988 --> 00:20:47,612
The entire railway
division knows that.

241
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:49,323
How could anyone
have given it to you?

242
00:20:50,284 --> 00:20:51,985
Could you tug that
chain for me please?

243
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:37,433
You think you're the first
person to come up with this idea?

244
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:41,065
We spend eight hours a day in offices
like this, chewing tobacco, eh?

245
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:43,766
200 out of every 100 finance companies
dream of a scheme like this..

246
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,268
but trip over their own two feet..

247
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:53,482
..trying to find 500 investors
to chip in a thousand rupees each

248
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:55,984
The answer to my next
question is on your face but..

249
00:21:56,114 --> 00:22:00,907
I'll ask you anyway.. Mister,
where are your 500 investors?

250
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:03,909
What if I tell you I have them?

251
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,740
Where?

252
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,451
Here

253
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,124
I've slogged it out
for a whole year, sir

254
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,336
I've gotten together 500 investors..

255
00:22:15,456 --> 00:22:17,627
..from my town and
the neighbouring ones..

256
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,169
..willing to put up a thousand rupees
each in any good finance company

257
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,251
Where are you from?

258
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,042
Fursatganj

259
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:31,466
Fursatganj! Where l was once

260
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:34,007
Not one finance company..

261
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:39,221
..will waste five minutes
over a list like this one.

262
00:22:39,511 --> 00:22:41,972
Talk of investments

263
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:47,145
Small town-guys have a habit of
dreaming big. No ban on dreaming..

264
00:22:47,225 --> 00:22:48,896
..Indulge yourself

265
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:51,558
But next time, come up
with a scheme that..

266
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:58,522
..a thousand others haven't thought
up before you. Get it? Now excuse me

267
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:14,702
Where are you going, lady?
- To enter the contest

268
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:17,744
You can't go in.
- If l can't go inside..

269
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:19,165
..how do I take part
in the competition?

270
00:23:19,285 --> 00:23:20,876
Let me in. l've come really far

271
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,748
I said, you can't go in.
- I say, I have to enter

272
00:23:30,502 --> 00:23:33,464
Can l help you?
- Yes, myself Vimmi Saluja..

273
00:23:33,544 --> 00:23:35,675
I've come to enter the contest.
- You're too late

274
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:39,007
What?
- The entries closed two days ago

275
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:41,469
You mean the contest's begun?
- No, not yet

276
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,431
Oh, that's a relief.
- I said, entries have closed

277
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:48,263
But the contest hasn't begun!
- I said "the-entries-have-closed"

278
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:50,554
So open up for two minutes,
I'll quickly squeeze in!

279
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:53,646
You're from some village?
Miss Quickly-squeeze-in!

280
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:57,689
This is no village fair to
squeeze-in-slip-out when-you-wish

281
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,101
This is the Miss lndia contest,
but what would you know?

282
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,442
Oh c'mon Pammi, forget it

283
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:07,155
One minute.. would I know what?
- The desire and the ability..

284
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:10,487
..to become Miss lndia are two
very different things. So go home..

285
00:24:10,567 --> 00:24:15,910
..and start a beauty parlour.
- Why not beauty-parlour yourself?

286
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,911
Excuse me?
- Ever watched your figure?

287
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:19,862
At least ten kilos overweight..

288
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:22,414
Ever watched your figure? At
least ten kilos overweight..

289
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:26,246
..with miles-thick lipstick.
You know all about make-up.

290
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:28,117
Beauty parlour's for you

291
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,168
What a bitch

292
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:30,709
You bitch

293
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:46,889
-=Deathracer=-

294
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:00,978
Listen..

295
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:06,731
Yes?
- Please come with me to the toilet

296
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:12,855
It's right at the end of the
platform and it's really dark

297
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:19,199
Come

298
00:25:25,613 --> 00:25:28,324
Weren't you on the
Jhansi Mail this morning?

299
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,247
Returning? Here on business?

300
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:37,870
Yes I came for the
Miss India contest

301
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,464
So how was it?

302
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:48,337
Good.. very good

303
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:52,049
I got through the first round

304
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,921
Good.. good.. Miss India!

305
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:02,425
And you? Here on business too?
- Oh no.. no..

306
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:07,058
Work is something I
don't really believe in

307
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,390
I came here for a meeting

308
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,313
There's a finance company here,
they want to buy my scheme

309
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:21,067
I had to come personally you see,
it's a matter of millions

310
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:29,362
So, you're becoming a model soon?
- I guess so

311
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:35,496
You'll become famous.
- Yes.. I guess so

312
00:26:36,656 --> 00:26:39,448
People will buzz around
you like bees around honey

313
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,950
Yes.. I guess they will

314
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,626
Why are you crying?

315
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,707
I didn't mean to insult you

316
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,588
No, don't take me otherwise

317
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,093
I belong to a decent family,
I wouldn't dream of it

318
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:07,175
Calm down, everyone's watching

319
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:11,558
Poor thing.. she's in grieving

320
00:27:11,848 --> 00:27:13,559
I was only sympathising..

321
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,852
Everything's fine

322
00:27:17,982 --> 00:27:19,853
Mummy.

323
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,978
You'll be the first girl to cry after
making it to the Miss India contest

324
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,735
I didn't make it anywhere

325
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:43,868
Aren't you ashamed of lying?

326
00:27:51,162 --> 00:27:53,744
Actually, I lied too..

327
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:57,836
..the manager of the finance
company didn't quite buy my scheme..

328
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:00,338
I think he doesn't have the drive

329
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:03,250
Bloody idiot

330
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,923
Foulmouthing.. me?

331
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:10,554
Escort her to the loo
and then get abused for it?

332
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:14,637
I escorted you! Who
do you think you are?

333
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:27,144
You mean if you go back now?
- Wedding bells..

334
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:31,437
That's too bad.
- Very

335
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,358
Then?

336
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,442
I'll run away.

337
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:45,196
You already have

338
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:52,870
So, what'll you do now?
- What'll you do?

339
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:59,664
Whatever I do, I'm not giving up.
And l'm not going back home

340
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:01,035
Then, where will you go?

341
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,339
Kanpur

342
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:11,292
Why Kanpur? - The
company has a head office there

343
00:29:11,422 --> 00:29:15,544
I'll show my scheme to senior
officers, I'm sure they'll get it

344
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,717
Why don't you come along to Kanpur?
- Who me?

345
00:29:21,098 --> 00:29:24,510
Miss India contests
are held all over.

346
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,301
Maybe they'll allow
you to enter there

347
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:30,724
You got to find a
way into the contest..

348
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:32,395
..else what use was running away?

349
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:36,267
Kanpur!

350
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,952
So long, l guess the next
time I see you it'll be on TV

351
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:07,286
I guess so. Thank you. And
good luck for your big meeting

352
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:10,328
Thanks but that was superfluous.

353
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:13,250
I only need to make a
presentation and voila!

354
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,422
I'll have 100 finance
companies running rings around me

355
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,463
See you

356
00:30:23,846 --> 00:30:30,891
Unbelievable. Got to admit..
very few people have brains as sharp

357
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:38,095
I say, just once in a whole year,
let me meet just one such person

358
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:44,099
But two in a single day,
unbelievable!

359
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:49,482
Would you believe..

360
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:54,525
just half an hour ago, another man
came to me with an identical scheme

361
00:30:56,196 --> 00:31:00,489
Who?
- Manager of our Lucknow branch..

362
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:06,112
Mr Qureishi! Imagine.. a rare
gem lay buried in my own backyard

363
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,075
He got a 10,000 bonus on the spot!

364
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:16,208
..He even had a
list of 500 investors.

365
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:18,710
Unbelievable! What a man!
- Where's he staying?

366
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,373
Landmark Hotel.
- In Landmark! And why not?

367
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:27,005
The 10,000 bonus!

368
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:34,049
Give me as much l'll go
to live in a five star too

369
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:36,301
Next?
- Vimmi Saluja

370
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:39,843
Address?
- 2/5 Ballygunj, Pankinagar

371
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,637
One minute..

372
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:53,351
Doesn't Pankinagar fall
within the Lucknow district?

373
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:56,603
It does?
- Yes, Lucknow district

374
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:59,645
You didn't fill up
the form in Lucknow?

375
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:03,237
What difference, here or there?

376
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:05,859
I was passing through Kanpur so
I thought I'll get it over with

377
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,530
Very good

378
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,362
Please step outside

379
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:17,156
Sir'ji, just a matter of an address..
- Go away! Rules are rules

380
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:19,457
Please..
- Get lost

381
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,959
Oversmartness

382
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:34,967
Look, l can't bend the rules

383
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:39,840
But if you wish..

384
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,421
I can forget rules for a while

385
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:47,805
Yes sir!
- But nothing comes for free

386
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:51,057
Sir, I'll do whatever you wish!

387
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:55,349
Very good! Once you're Miss India..

388
00:32:55,439 --> 00:33:01,273
..you'll have all the wealth, all
the fame your heart ever desired

389
00:33:02,854 --> 00:33:07,357
But I? I'm still stuck to
the same.. chair and table

390
00:33:07,857 --> 00:33:10,319
Oh sure..

391
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,820
I have nothing right now..

392
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,783
but I promise, when l'm Miss India..

393
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:20,535
I'll pay you..
everything you'll ever want

394
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:28,870
You're mistaken. You have everything
I'll ever want.. right now

395
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,664
I won't force you.
Registration closes in five minutes.

396
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:37,916
Think it over

397
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:41,168
You'll find me at the same table

398
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:25,074
What's your name?
- Jajjan

399
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:28,577
You make tea?
- No, I serve tea

400
00:34:34,951 --> 00:34:38,743
This world we live in boy,
has two kinds of people

401
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:43,336
One, those who serve tea.
And those to whom tea is served

402
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,627
The faster you
become one of the latter..

403
00:34:45,707 --> 00:34:47,458
..the better the
life that you'll live

404
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,550
Has somebody hurt you?

405
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,966
Two teas and chips

406
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:02,097
Two?

407
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:06,600
Why? Problem?
- No. But who's the second cup for?

408
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,722
If l drink two cups,
will it start a war?

409
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:14,475
God, this world we live in!
Get a hold on this kid

410
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:20,108
It's no use.
- What?

411
00:35:21,229 --> 00:35:23,150
No use being earnest,

412
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:26,072
unwitting fools getting
shoved in stinking little towns

413
00:35:26,322 --> 00:35:27,403
Then?

414
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:29,984
Bombay..

415
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:34,827
..the only city in all of lndia where
a man is recognised for his worth..

416
00:35:36,158 --> 00:35:38,910
the only place where you can start..

417
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,742
..from the pavement
and end up in palaces..

418
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:45,204
where ambition isn't pushed around,
but cheered, egging you on

419
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,665
How're you so sure?
- How..

420
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:52,668
if Dhirubhai Ambani, Ratan Tata,
Birla had been in Lucknow-Kanpur..

421
00:35:52,748 --> 00:35:55,380
..they'd be swatting flies in Ambani
General Stores, Tata Flour Mills..

422
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,922
..And Birla Tobacco Stall.

423
00:35:58,382 --> 00:36:00,883
Bombay.. gave them the
recognition they deserved

424
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:02,594
Look where it got them..

425
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:07,758
So you want to go Bombay?

426
00:36:09,889 --> 00:36:12,681
You can come along too.
What'll you do here?

427
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,763
All the top models are in Bombay.

428
00:36:16,103 --> 00:36:19,145
Damn this
narrow-minded small-town mob

429
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:23,397
It's the place for Miss lndia, no?
- Yes

430
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:29,561
A ticket to Bombay,
how much would it cost?

431
00:36:31,402 --> 00:36:33,403
Not that I have that kind of cash

432
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:43,370
I got the cash, don't worry.
- What?

433
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,201
We've seen where
truth has landed us.

434
00:36:46,281 --> 00:36:48,743
Now let's say what they want to hear

435
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:52,995
And what's that?
- Oi Jajjan, where's Landmark Hotel?

436
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,378
One whiskey..
- Which one sir?

437
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:01,080
Imported. How much for a
Black Label? - Four hundred, sir

438
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,882
For a bottle?
- No. 30 ml

439
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,422
Small peg

440
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:09,966
I'll try an Indian whiskey for a
change. And don't forget the peanuts

441
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:17,220
Some pretty suave people you
got walking into this Gazal Bar

442
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:25,395
One Black Label
- Sir

443
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:31,649
Sir! You here?

444
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:35,812
Fursatganj! All of Lucknow seems
to be pouring into Kanpur today

445
00:37:35,902 --> 00:37:39,814
Slick! What are you doing here?
- You'll be seeing more of me here

446
00:37:40,064 --> 00:37:43,907
What do you mean?
- My scheme got rocking

447
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,739
Which.. the same one?
- No.. it was unworkable

448
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:51,862
You tipped me off in time. I
could've wasted another good year

449
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:56,494
This is another scheme.
- Which is this?

450
00:37:56,745 --> 00:38:00,037
I explained this scheme..

451
00:38:00,127 --> 00:38:03,249
..they offered me a two
per cent stake in the channel

452
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:06,501
What channel?
- A news channel

453
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,082
News channel

454
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:16,087
Nowadays this news channel business
is taking off like a rocket

455
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:20,089
In 3 months, they're giving
investors a 300 per cent..

456
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:21,380
..return on investment

457
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,512
Cigarette?
- Really?

458
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:28,764
How much.. is the investment?
- At least 100,000

459
00:38:29,014 --> 00:38:35,348
Won't they take a little less?
I mean, I could invest too?

460
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:38,230
Why don't you have a chat?

461
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,734
Give me an introduction

462
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:55,401
This is Mr. Qureishi
- Q.Q. Qureishi

463
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:59,033
Q.Q. Qureishi, a very dear friend.

464
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:04,576
Whatever I am
today is because of him

465
00:39:05,747 --> 00:39:09,039
Hello.
- Hello

466
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:18,875
Mr. Qureishi would like
to invest in the channel

467
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:20,966
How many millions?

468
00:39:23,008 --> 00:39:26,920
He's not like other investors..
this is just a friendly gesture..

469
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,131
about ten thousand?
- Ten

470
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,423
Ten?

471
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:33,804
Fifteen?
- Fifteen?

472
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:38,427
But you're aware, it
should be at least..

473
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:43,850
Ok, all right, now
how can l refuse you?

474
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:48,984
One request..

475
00:39:49,234 --> 00:39:55,147
..this remains between us..
let this be our little secret

476
00:39:55,237 --> 00:39:58,780
No, no!
- Promise

477
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:03,533
We must be in Delhi by morning

478
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:08,115
So you take the cash from him..

479
00:40:08,456 --> 00:40:11,247
..and fetch us a
receipt from my room. - Okay.

480
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,909
In the meantime, if
he has no objections..

481
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:18,292
..Mr. Qureishi can give me company
- Yes?

482
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:23,705
Well?
- No.. l mean no problem

483
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,919
Ten?

484
00:40:35,552 --> 00:40:37,964
Fursatganj, don't forget the receipt

485
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:48,270
Would you like to dance with me

486
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:53,353
Mr Q.Q. Qureishi?

487
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:57,396
Yes, .

488
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:05,531
You dance really well.
- Thank you

489
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:11,114
Where's the ladies'?
- Thank you

490
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:16,908
The washroom.. where is it?
- Bartender, where's the washroom?

491
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:31,126
Run

492
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,886
What d'you think of my acting?
Better than yours?

493
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:52,600
Who conned him to your table?
- Who made the sucker dance?

494
00:41:56,812 --> 00:42:02,065
I'd love to see Q.Q.
Qureishi dancing

495
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:08,820
Hey, the cash

496
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,611
Some sample

497
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,904
Your share.
- You keep it

498
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:19,276
It's your share.
- Not a gift

499
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:23,118
Just bank it for me till Bombay.
I can't manage money

500
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,701
We had fun though, no?

501
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:33,245
Lots..

502
00:42:50,425 --> 00:42:52,967
Move it. Sit in the bus

503
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:58,260
Passengers for Dehradun and Ambala,
your bus is leaving

504
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,763
Name?
- Bunty

505
00:43:04,434 --> 00:43:05,645
And the Mrs?

506
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:08,016
Babli

507
00:43:08,106 --> 00:43:12,479
Bunty.. Babli.. seats 21 and 22

508
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,150
Get inside

509
00:43:19,273 --> 00:43:25,197
Bunty.. Babli.. what the hell?
- Nothing.. move on. 21 and 22

510
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:30,320
What do you mean nothing?
- Sit down, I'll explain

511
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:36,243
When I was a kid I always blamed
Bunty for all the mischief I did

512
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:40,376
And we've just stolen money. So..
- But.. what the hell is Babli?

513
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:43,378
Why, what's wrong? I don't
have a problem with Bunty

514
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:47,710
You look like your Bunty! But
Babli.. she sounds like a fat slob

515
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:53,634
Fat or thin, now it's sealed.
- You could've asked me

516
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,716
Ask my wife her name in
front of a bus conductor?

517
00:43:56,796 --> 00:44:01,719
Who are you calling your wife?
- I didn't say that, he thought so

518
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:08,303
And you let it pass! Now everyone
in this bus thinks I'm Bunty's wife

519
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:15,898
What are you doing? Everyone
will think Bunty's wife is a shrew

520
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:19,190
Stop it!
- You stop it

521
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,522
I'm not talking.
- Suits me

522
00:44:22,612 --> 00:44:24,103
Babli, big deal

523
00:44:48,708 --> 00:44:52,370
At least we managed
enough to get us to Bombay

524
00:44:55,582 --> 00:44:58,374
This stash won't
last us a week in Bombay

525
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:00,425
And?

526
00:45:02,006 --> 00:45:09,551
And.. l think we'll need lots
more if we want to make it in Bombay

527
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:13,633
Where will we get so much money?
- The same place we got this from

528
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,594
You mean another?

529
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:23,229
Are you mad? What are you saying?
- I'm not saying a thing. Bunty is

530
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:30,854
And l'm doing what Bunty's saying?
- Who are you to do? Babli will

531
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,145
Babli?

532
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,449
But I am Babli!
- Sure

533
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:44,362
You are when you are

534
00:45:45,413 --> 00:45:46,864
You aren't when you aren't

535
00:45:49,535 --> 00:45:52,577
Say, what are you now?

536
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,959
Bunty. You?

537
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,041
Babli?

538
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:13,760
Babli Bose, Food Inspector.
I'll inspect your kitchen

539
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,422
We hear, the beer
is adulterated here.

540
00:46:17,132 --> 00:46:19,634
Tony, a chilled beer for the sahib

541
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:23,096
One step, two step, he steps it up
swings it, pumps it, struts his stuff

542
00:46:23,186 --> 00:46:24,557
Meet Bunty

543
00:46:27,188 --> 00:46:30,681
Minute by minute, she turns it up
spins it so you can't get enough

544
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:32,061
Meet Babli

545
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:42,068
Spinning like tops,
orchestrating rip-offs..

546
00:46:42,148 --> 00:46:46,941
they'll clean your pockets,
cock a snook and be off

547
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:53,445
There ain't a legit soul
from who they never stole

548
00:46:53,535 --> 00:46:57,117
When they dig, they dig so deep
you can't get out of that hole

549
00:46:57,207 --> 00:47:01,700
Swings it, pumps it,
struts his stuff Oye Bunty

550
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,623
Bunty Saluja, Tourism department.
Unclean rooms. Got to inspect

551
00:47:06,753 --> 00:47:10,045
Unclean? How many days
of inspection? - Three

552
00:47:10,125 --> 00:47:15,258
She turns it on, spins it so
you can't get enough. Oye Babli

553
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,552
Bunty And Babli

554
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:23,423
They maybe two..

555
00:47:23,513 --> 00:47:25,304
but they're too much

556
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,719
Bunty Aur Babli.. Bunty and Babli

557
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:36,561
They maybe two but they're too
much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

558
00:47:44,606 --> 00:47:51,480
Consider it your's. Take it away..

559
00:47:56,864 --> 00:48:00,536
What model number is this?
- Model number can take a hike!

560
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:05,619
Why isn't your man back yet?
- What man?

561
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:12,743
Man.. means husband. - Husband!
What crap. You bloody fool

562
00:48:15,915 --> 00:48:20,838
Love is wild like pigeon wings

563
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:29,214
Tantrums trip on diamond rings

564
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:32,676
Don't you blink

565
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:36,468
You might see their shadows pass

566
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:40,310
Tea cups clink. Tea cups crash.
Forgive, forget, they have a fight..

567
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,512
wipe their mouths
and take full flight..

568
00:48:43,602 --> 00:48:49,436
come, come, come on, come on,
one step, two step, swing it Bunty

569
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:58,231
She turns it on, spins it so
you can't get enough. Oye Babli

570
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:02,734
Bunty Aur Babli.. Bunty and Babli

571
00:49:02,824 --> 00:49:06,526
They maybe two but they're too
much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

572
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:13,991
Bunty Aur Babli.. Bunty and Babli

573
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:17,873
They maybe two but they're too
much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

574
00:49:22,746 --> 00:49:25,458
Bulandshahr is abuzz with
the amusing misadventures..

575
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:29,501
of this daring duo who call
themselves Bunty and Babli

576
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:35,294
People seem to be in awe of
their ingenuity and audacity

577
00:49:46,471 --> 00:49:48,392
Would you like a room or a suite?

578
00:49:49,973 --> 00:49:53,645
No, I don't want just a room

579
00:49:54,146 --> 00:49:59,109
I want the hotel.. we're
here to buy this place

580
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:03,562
I never thought I'd sell this
place. But your strong background..

581
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:08,314
and this mind blowing offer..
I'd have to be a lunatic to refuse

582
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:10,486
How long are you here?

583
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:14,618
A week maybe..
- Stay here then.. as our guests

584
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,620
This hotel's as good as yours.

585
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:20,622
We'll discuss
details over the weekend

586
00:50:20,832 --> 00:50:25,705
No, doesn't look good. We can't stay
before we've signed the dotted line

587
00:50:25,785 --> 00:50:30,288
I won't take no for an answer

588
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:34,581
Well if you insist.. champagne?

589
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:20,239
Searched every inch of
Mussoorie sir, l can't find them

590
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,821
What do you mean? And their stuff?
- They even stole ours

591
00:51:24,912 --> 00:51:26,322
Damn them

592
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:36,869
Come away, come away

593
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:44,374
All our sparkles fly
right across the sky

594
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:51,678
Then we sight the
morning light Float up high

595
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,090
Witness the magic of Guru'ji

596
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,723
People running after you
like this.. it's a heady feeling

597
00:51:59,803 --> 00:52:02,515
What? - Makes me feels
like I'm an achiever

598
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,393
They walk wrapped in perfume mists

599
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:24,238
Hold the world in love-locked fists

600
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:31,072
You won't see them flit about till
they want you to, and when you do..

601
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:35,155
he slides with a swagger.
- He's Bunty

602
00:52:35,245 --> 00:52:38,707
She glides zig-zagger.
- She's Babli

603
00:52:38,787 --> 00:52:43,160
Their tales are lore.. been
told a score times and more

604
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,082
And will be sung forever more

605
00:52:47,923 --> 00:52:50,624
Their tales are lore.. been
told a score times and more

606
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:54,086
And will be sung forever more

607
00:52:55,337 --> 00:52:59,840
I can't see any tunnel here..
- We've paid a hundred bucks apiece

608
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:02,421
Where's that Bunty guide?

609
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:06,764
Spinning like tops,
orchestrating rip-offs..

610
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:12,177
they'll clean your pockets,
cock a snook and be off..

611
00:53:13,598 --> 00:53:18,021
there ain't a legit soul
from who they never stole..

612
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:21,813
and they dig so deep you
can't get out that hole

613
00:53:21,893 --> 00:53:23,354
One step, two step

614
00:53:23,444 --> 00:53:26,937
Swings it, pumps it,
struts his stuff Oye Bunty

615
00:53:29,028 --> 00:53:34,361
She turns it on, spins it so
you can't get enough. Oye Babli

616
00:53:36,863 --> 00:53:40,405
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli

617
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:44,287
They maybe two but they're too
much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

618
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,662
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli

619
00:53:51,872 --> 00:53:55,454
They maybe two but they're too
much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch

620
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:18,428
I'm so hungry I can't think straight

621
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:26,183
And you will shut up and eat
whatever's available. No tantrums

622
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:29,685
Makes you cry?

623
00:54:32,357 --> 00:54:35,979
What's to cry about?
- None of your business

624
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,984
Look, what I meant was you
can't get pizzas out here

625
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,579
All right, I'll get
whatever you feel like

626
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,661
Tell me what you want

627
00:54:59,003 --> 00:55:03,296
Who?
- I want my mummy

628
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:10,420
But..

629
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:13,092
Out here?

630
00:55:13,632 --> 00:55:15,593
I miss her

631
00:55:21,807 --> 00:55:23,058
You miss her a lot?

632
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,351
Go on, get it over with

633
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:37,147
Mummy.

634
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:54,617
Mummy

635
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,742
Over?

636
00:56:05,244 --> 00:56:10,707
Not over! I'm missing her,
not laying an egg! Over!

637
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:21,214
What do you miss?

638
00:56:23,215 --> 00:56:24,886
When I was little..

639
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:28,258
Papa'ji would talk about
taking us for a holiday..

640
00:56:28,808 --> 00:56:31,550
..far away from Pankinagar

641
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:38,604
But in all my years of waiting, we
never saved up enough for a holiday

642
00:56:43,477 --> 00:56:45,058
You want to send some money home?

643
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:50,812
Do you want to call them?

644
00:56:56,075 --> 00:56:57,236
Come..

645
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:11,825
Hello!

646
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:16,077
No one's saying anything

647
00:57:16,168 --> 00:57:18,999
Then why are you
wasting your breath?

648
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,502
- I don't know why..
I think it's Vimmi

649
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:30,887
Who's this?

650
00:57:32,257 --> 00:57:33,428
Some nut

651
00:57:34,259 --> 00:57:35,339
Papa'ji

652
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,891
It's me.. Papa'ji

653
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:42,594
Vimmi, my child..
where did you disappear?

654
00:57:43,724 --> 00:57:47,557
I'm okay Papa, I'm fine

655
00:57:48,147 --> 00:57:50,519
Vimmi my child, where are you?

656
00:57:50,729 --> 00:57:55,692
I can't tell Mummy, but l'm fine

657
00:57:57,113 --> 00:57:58,193
Look dear..

658
00:57:58,273 --> 00:58:04,948
No Papa'ji, don't ask me to come
back now.. I don't want to come back

659
00:58:05,738 --> 00:58:10,951
But I really love both of you

660
00:58:11,031 --> 00:58:17,415
No, my child, listen to me..
- No Papa'ji. I'm hanging up now

661
00:58:19,126 --> 00:58:21,117
I love you both very much

662
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,500
Bye..

663
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:41,260
You want to call home too?

664
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:44,302
No

665
00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:49,385
Folks at home must be
worried about you too

666
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:01,562
No one worries about me

667
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:14,860
What are you doing here?

668
00:59:18,072 --> 00:59:24,957
Wondering where he's now..
how he's doing

669
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:29,540
Do you think l was too harsh on him?

670
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:33,542
You were right in whatever you did

671
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,754
Have your tea, it's
time to go to work

672
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,309
Enough? Satisfied?

673
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,232
If you manage money like this in
Bombay in no time, you'll be back..

674
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:09,564
in your punk-whatever-town.
- Pankinagar, you bloody idiot

675
01:00:09,644 --> 01:00:13,146
Wherever, but you're finished.
- What's left to count?

676
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:15,108
You've blown it all up.

677
01:00:16,448 --> 01:00:20,691
I have, have I?

678
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:24,693
Expensive dresses, shoploads of
makeup just fell out of the sky?

679
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:29,036
They came from the same place as
your watch, designer shirt, jeans..

680
01:00:29,406 --> 01:00:32,038
and.. this deodorant that
smells like turnip pickle gone bad

681
01:00:32,118 --> 01:00:33,829
They fell off the sky, they did

682
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:38,002
Now what?

683
01:00:46,087 --> 01:00:47,507
I've been thinking..

684
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:51,420
Let's.. do it one more time?
- No..

685
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:54,212
we've pooled enough
to get us to Bombay.

686
01:00:55,672 --> 01:01:01,766
has two kinds of people.

687
01:01:02,477 --> 01:01:04,638
One.. those who
collect enough and those..

688
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:07,180
who'll never have enough.

689
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:11,222
Myself and Tata-Birla-Ambanis
are the other kind

690
01:01:11,312 --> 01:01:16,856
That's why they're where they are
today. And once we're in Bombay..

691
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:19,437
we won't get another chance.

692
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:26,692
So.. let's take one
last crack. Just once more

693
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:30,904
You think so?

694
01:01:31,995 --> 01:01:33,286
I know so. So I say so

695
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:36,538
Who says so? You or Bunty?
- Bunty's always saying so

696
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:41,160
Today a little of me is with Bunty.

697
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:45,373
Oye Rakesh.. my sweet bloody idiot

698
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:49,416
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli

699
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:53,588
They are coming to your town.
They hustle then, they hustle now.

700
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,673
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli

701
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:05,716
Making money all around.
Never do they settle down.

702
01:02:10,348 --> 01:02:12,850
This one.
- No problem

703
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,641
There's just one problem

704
01:02:14,721 --> 01:02:18,603
Just tell me.
- I'm leaving for Mussoorie tonight

705
01:02:18,684 --> 01:02:21,315
Oh, that is a beautiful place
- I know

706
01:02:21,725 --> 01:02:24,647
Tomorrow I have an inauguration.
- Your inauguration?

707
01:02:24,727 --> 01:02:26,608
Not mine.. my hotel's

708
01:02:26,688 --> 01:02:27,979
Oh, I see

709
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:30,401
Look Mrs..
- Miss..

710
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:37,275
Miss.. earliest we can deliver
would be by tomorrow morning

711
01:02:37,985 --> 01:02:45,200
It's closing time, you see? And
we can't stay open for one machine

712
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:49,032
No, no.. not one machine.
- Then?

713
01:02:49,492 --> 01:02:52,084
All.
- All?

714
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:55,086
But if the mall isn't open..

715
01:02:55,166 --> 01:03:00,709
No.. l'll open up myself.. l mean..

716
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,340
I'll open it up myself for you

717
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:04,422
Lovely

718
01:03:08,594 --> 01:03:11,426
Sixty thousand
- Sixty thousand

719
01:03:11,886 --> 01:03:17,300
You take cash don't you?
- I take anything you say

720
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,483
Let's shop

721
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:46,237
Easy brother, easy. The
stuff inside is real precious

722
01:03:47,618 --> 01:03:49,319
Hi!
- Hi!

723
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:55,033
Sorry for troubling you so much.

724
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,284
You can trouble me
as much as you wish

725
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:01,167
Please visit our hotel sometime.
- Sure

726
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:04,328
Your machines are now yours

727
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,131
Here's the balance amount

728
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:13,294
Thank you very much
- Mention not

729
01:04:13,674 --> 01:04:17,837
May God send customers
like you my way every day

730
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:22,640
I pray we come by
shops like yours everyday

731
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:30,184
Driver!
- I have the same..

732
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:36,058
We seem to share similar tastes.
- I wish we find more in common

733
01:04:48,446 --> 01:04:51,407
Mehmood! Let her rip.

734
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:54,239
You sound like he's after us already

735
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:58,412
If he isn't, then he soon will

736
01:05:00,283 --> 01:05:02,784
Oye Bunty, you gave him a licking?

737
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:26,679
300,000 worth of shades

738
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,762
400,000 in watches

739
01:05:30,842 --> 01:05:32,723
Bunty and Babli.

740
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,634
700,000 in electronic items

741
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:36,345
Deal

742
01:05:39,307 --> 01:05:41,348
Time for a Chinese lunch. Come

743
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:46,101
I can't count any more

744
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:49,273
The incredible
incident at the renowned..

745
01:05:49,353 --> 01:05:50,944
..Center One Mall in Bareilly..

746
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:55,447
has confounded the police.
Sources say,

747
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:58,108
..the perpetrators
of this heist are..

748
01:05:58,198 --> 01:06:04,452
Bunty and Babli whose capers have
already made headlines in many cities

749
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:06,283
Even as investigations proceed..

750
01:06:06,364 --> 01:06:11,617
..by now Bunty and
Babli must be far far away

751
01:06:12,457 --> 01:06:15,209
Tomorrow morning! Bombay.
- That soon?

752
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:19,832
Before you've brushed your teeth.
This train gets there like a bullet

753
01:06:20,082 --> 01:06:23,584
Good. We can get to work
the minute we get there

754
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:28,587
You're hunting for the top models?

755
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:31,419
Like you're
catching your Tata-Birlas

756
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:36,012
Your share

757
01:06:37,132 --> 01:06:40,595
Always splitting cash at the
drop of a hat? What's with you?

758
01:06:40,685 --> 01:06:44,557
Let's just get it over with,
no? So tomorrow..

759
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:46,888
you get on with your life,
I'll get on with mine

760
01:06:46,978 --> 01:06:51,601
What'll you do without me? I mean,
on your own.. in Bombay?

761
01:06:52,352 --> 01:06:54,023
Hog the whole bathroom?

762
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:02,108
You'll have complete freedom too, no?
Nobody will be getting on your nerves

763
01:07:02,988 --> 01:07:08,692
Well you didn't bug me that much.
- Really now?

764
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:12,694
The way you fought, I would have
to be the meanest man in the world

765
01:07:14,455 --> 01:07:17,998
I can't believe, by
tomorrow morning I'll be in Bombay

766
01:07:18,578 --> 01:07:22,330
All these dreams, all these years..
is everything finally coming true?

767
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:30,045
Flap your wings, come on let's fly

768
01:07:33,087 --> 01:07:39,091

Balle-Balle on a Sundae-Sunday

772
01:08:05,607 --> 01:08:07,648
Balle-Balle

773
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:12,781
Balle-Balle on a Sundae-Sunday

774
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:14,903

Let's set the
streets of Juliet on fire.

780
01:08:33,954 --> 01:08:37,376
Dance with Romeo in
the streets of desire

781
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:41,839
We explode with the light

782
01:08:42,259 --> 01:08:44,421
Burn the dance floor, girl

783
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:45,962

Get into the groove.

Love to watch you baby, turn around

Get into the groove

Get into the groove.

Round. Round. Round. Round.

The red carpet of dreams
unfurls for us to walk on..

801
01:09:37,203 --> 01:09:40,585
Fate's now a little toy,
to toss, to roll, to rock on

802
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:47,590
Take your bets now, gamble your life.
Fate's at my feet. Ready to ride?

Then come take my hand, love.

Day doesn't sink into night here

823
01:11:17,855 --> 01:11:21,017
These roads stay awake, alight here

824
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:28,061
Tip-toeing upon my eyelids

Flap your wings, come on, let's fly.

844
01:12:36,443 --> 01:12:39,645
Flap your wings,
let's taste the sky.

845
01:12:39,695 --> 01:12:42,947
Let's set the
streets of Juliet on fire.

846
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:46,570
Dance with Romeo in
the streets of desire.

847
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:50,492
We explode with the light.

848
01:12:50,572 --> 01:12:54,995
Burn the dance floor, lad.
- Burn the dance floor, lass.

849
01:12:55,075 --> 01:12:56,866
Dance, buddy.

850
01:12:56,956 --> 01:13:00,368
Want bangles on your wrist, love?
- Dance, buddy.

851
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:04,000
Want jewels in your hair, love?
- Dance, buddy.

852
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,873
Want anklets around your feet,
love? - Dance, buddy.

853
01:13:08,963 --> 01:13:11,165
Dance, buddy.

854
01:13:11,255 --> 01:13:14,757
Give me bangles on my wrist, love.
- Dance, buddy.

855
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:18,379
Weave jewels into my hair, love.
- Dance, buddy.

856
01:13:18,469 --> 01:13:23,842
I want anklets around my feet,
love. - Dance, buddy.

857
01:13:24,723 --> 01:13:28,555
Train from Delhi to
Bombay is arriving on..

858
01:13:28,635 --> 01:13:34,519
..platform 36 instead of platform 12

859
01:14:01,576 --> 01:14:03,117
Bombay's really crowded, no?

860
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:05,698
Everyone's here to make
their dreams come true, no?

861
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:08,750
What's this stench?
Must be fish, no?

862
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:10,661
Where do you think
fashion shows happen here?

863
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,452
Let's get you into a taxi

864
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,754
And.. you?

865
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,667
I'm going back.
- What!

866
01:14:21,298 --> 01:14:26,461
Look, l don't want to stay
in Bombay. - What do you mean?

867
01:14:29,053 --> 01:14:35,427
I just.. wanted to be really famous.

868
01:14:36,517 --> 01:14:37,888
a name to be reckoned with..

869
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:40,390
a name in the headlines

870
01:14:43,642 --> 01:14:47,774
Vimmi, for the first
time in my life l think..

871
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:51,566
..I have a talent no one else has

872
01:14:54,568 --> 01:14:59,191
I realise now, I never was Rakesh.

873
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:02,943
I've always been Bunty..

874
01:15:03,824 --> 01:15:05,615
I've always enjoyed being him

875
01:15:07,946 --> 01:15:14,410
To tell you the truth, I never
had the perseverance it takes..

876
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:19,333
to become a Tata or Ambani,
nor the calibre

877
01:15:21,505 --> 01:15:25,958
Anyway, doesn't matter now. I
think I've discovered my destination

878
01:15:26,418 --> 01:15:27,999
And l'm on my way towards it

879
01:15:31,461 --> 01:15:32,712
Look..

880
01:15:34,553 --> 01:15:39,556
this is what I want to do..

881
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:42,308
all my life, freely

882
01:15:43,678 --> 01:15:48,812
But you please become
a model, a supermodel..

883
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:56,016
so take care

884
01:15:57,227 --> 01:15:59,608
All this.. you did it all alone?

885
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:03,771
That's not what l meant.
- Then?

886
01:16:05,152 --> 01:16:08,614
Without you..
- You can't walk one step, you know?

887
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:14,117
Wants himself in headlines!
Who wants to read about you?

888
01:16:14,447 --> 01:16:19,080
No one's interested in reading
or publishing a Bunty-minus-Babli

889
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:26,245
Truth is.. without me, you could've
done nothing and you never will

890
01:16:29,837 --> 01:16:31,248
Your taxi..

891
01:16:31,338 --> 01:16:33,669
Tell me.. can you?

892
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,791
Yes

893
01:16:39,673 --> 01:16:40,794
No

894
01:16:40,844 --> 01:16:42,505
Can you live without me?

895
01:16:43,255 --> 01:16:44,466
Yes

896
01:16:49,849 --> 01:16:52,851
Then why are you screaming
taxi-taxi? - Because you need to go

897
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:56,103
Yes..
- So tell me.. where?

898
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:57,474
Where you want to go

899
01:17:11,072 --> 01:17:16,065
Who says so?
- You or Babli?

900
01:17:17,986 --> 01:17:22,319
What do you think?
- Must be you

901
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,991
So will you do something about it?

902
01:17:29,203 --> 01:17:32,455
If that's the case then I
must do something about it, no?

903
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:38,079
What the hell! I didn't mean that

904
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,582
Wasn't me. lt was Bunty.
- Everyone's staring

905
01:17:45,924 --> 01:17:47,254
We're in Bombay.

906
01:17:49,636 --> 01:17:51,177
No one looks at anyone here

907
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,301
Think it over

908
01:17:58,051 --> 01:18:02,844
I won't let you rule
over the bathroom. - Done

909
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:07,017
No more sleeping alone on
the floor. - Sounds good

910
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:09,058
What about all the modelling dreams?

911
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,020
That's Vimmi's problem

912
01:18:13,561 --> 01:18:14,691
But you?

913
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:18,484
I've become Babli

914
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:20,565
Forever

915
01:18:41,498 --> 01:18:45,620
You know what it's worth?
Not five paise. lt's a fake

916
01:18:58,638 --> 01:19:01,470
Who?
- What?

917
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:07,224
What's your name?

918
01:19:08,184 --> 01:19:09,725
Mehmood

919
01:19:10,896 --> 01:19:12,187
You're a comedian?

920
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:16,850
Let's start by making you laugh?

921
01:19:18,651 --> 01:19:20,602
Okay, two jokes for you

922
01:19:21,943 --> 01:19:23,103
One

923
01:19:24,104 --> 01:19:26,566
Mrs and Mr Flea come
out after a matinee show

924
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:29,447
Mrs Flea says, l'm tired today

925
01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:32,489
Mr Flea says, honey don't worry,
I'll hail us a dog

926
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:50,710
You are that dog.. the
one they rode for the hike

927
01:19:52,171 --> 01:19:54,373
Now spill it, did you go to
Center One that night or no?

928
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,124
No sir

929
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:03,168
This here, is my second joke

930
01:20:08,631 --> 01:20:10,052
Where are those two now?

931
01:20:10,132 --> 01:20:12,974
Long time.. gone

932
01:20:15,265 --> 01:20:16,476
Names?

933
01:20:16,556 --> 01:20:19,598
Bunty and Babli

934
01:20:25,312 --> 01:20:26,562
How old are they?

935
01:20:26,642 --> 01:20:29,524
Bunty's around 23-24

936
01:20:31,395 --> 01:20:32,986
Babli is 20-21

937
01:20:33,277 --> 01:20:39,070
She was really sweet, well
mannered and intelligent, sir

938
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:42,992
Even the boy was
all heart, great guy

939
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:44,744
That's quite something, sir

940
01:20:44,824 --> 01:20:46,995
No, you asses are quite something

941
01:20:48,496 --> 01:20:50,947
To think that petty criminals..

942
01:20:51,037 --> 01:20:54,950
booked for cheating, misdemeanour,
malfeasance, fraud and perjury..

943
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:59,373
are quite something

944
01:21:00,373 --> 01:21:02,545
And not just you, the
whole lot of you from..

945
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,045
..this generation is quite something

946
01:21:05,756 --> 01:21:09,379
Right and wrong, good esteem
and bad, good deeds and bad..

947
01:21:09,759 --> 01:21:12,341
you've forgotten
what sets them apart

948
01:21:18,344 --> 01:21:19,965
But I can tell the difference.

949
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,888
And l'm going to teach you fools too

950
01:21:25,349 --> 01:21:29,221
The newspapers say that for boys
and girls in schools and colleges..

951
01:21:29,311 --> 01:21:34,524
these two crooks are role models.
- So they want to be role models?

952
01:21:36,776 --> 01:21:37,976
Fine..

953
01:21:39,988 --> 01:21:42,189
then that's what they'll become..

954
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:51,655
I'll make them a fine example
of a cure for this generation

955
01:21:55,407 --> 01:21:58,199
What did you say their names were?
- Bunty and Babli

956
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,992
This Bunty-Babli
better watch out for me

957
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:23,085
We'll always place each
other before ourselves

958
01:22:23,797 --> 01:22:24,917
Okay

959
01:22:25,338 --> 01:22:27,919
We'll never ever
break each other's hearts

960
01:22:29,961 --> 01:22:31,502
And if we do so accidentally..

961
01:22:31,592 --> 01:22:33,423
..we won't burst into
tears without warning

962
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:39,759
Okay, we will never eat or
drink anything without each other

963
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:43,181
Except early morning tea

964
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:46,064
You wake up like a queen at
noon I can't wait that long

965
01:22:48,315 --> 01:22:50,568
We'll give each other the
same amount of love forever

966
01:22:50,648 --> 01:22:53,149
Why? We can give more! I'll
love you even more tomorrow..

967
01:22:53,649 --> 01:22:58,693
more the day after and so much
more the day after the day after

968
01:23:00,656 --> 01:23:04,449
We'll cut off all ties with
those who don't understand us

969
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:08,621
Except our parents.
- Your parents

970
01:23:12,545 --> 01:23:14,587
We'll be Bunty-Babli
for the rest of our lives

971
01:23:14,667 --> 01:23:18,709
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except..

972
01:23:19,801 --> 01:23:22,963
Except?
- Leave that to me

973
01:23:23,713 --> 01:23:24,885
Okay

974
01:23:28,057 --> 01:23:31,510
Oye Rakesh just married!

975
01:23:50,695 --> 01:23:51,906
Look..

976
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:57,911
right at the outset of this marriage
I want to tell you all about my past

977
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:02,074
I don't want any issues later

978
01:24:04,085 --> 01:24:09,921
In school, when I was in Class Two,

979
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:14,295
Mukesh used to sit behind me

980
01:24:15,465 --> 01:24:18,677
He used to tug at my plaits

981
01:24:22,971 --> 01:24:28,935
And you know.. it used to
make me giggle like crazy

982
01:24:30,057 --> 01:24:32,518
These boys are all scoundrels

983
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:38,353
They'll try their luck
with every cute girl

984
01:24:40,365 --> 01:24:41,696
How true

985
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:48,361
How lucky I am, you
aren't like those boys

986
01:24:49,783 --> 01:24:54,245
Rakesh.. you're such a good boy

987
01:24:54,325 --> 01:24:56,077
Sweet boy

988
01:25:00,081 --> 01:25:03,123
So.. what I was saying was..

989
01:25:05,505 --> 01:25:09,969
..now that you are my wife..

990
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:16,263
my mate in joy and sorrow..

991
01:25:18,555 --> 01:25:20,307
for all my days to come..

992
01:25:22,228 --> 01:25:26,892
and nights.. understand?

993
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:40,323
Asleep? On your wedding night!

994
01:25:52,252 --> 01:25:56,045
This world we live in
has two kinds of people..

995
01:25:58,086 --> 01:26:04,421
those who aren't
married and those who are

996
01:26:06,683 --> 01:26:07,804
So?

997
01:26:09,305 --> 01:26:11,097
So you belong to the latter, no?

998
01:26:13,519 --> 01:26:14,809
So?

999
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:17,892
So marry me now you fool

1000
01:26:57,224 --> 01:27:01,887
Look, above me..

1001
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:10,855
..the sky's soared away.

1002
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:25,987
Look, above me, the
sky's soared away.

1003
01:27:26,077 --> 01:27:43,300
I see my skies breaking free
of the earth at the horizon..

1004
01:27:43,380 --> 01:27:47,133
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1005
01:27:47,213 --> 01:27:50,555
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1006
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:55,309
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1007
01:27:55,349 --> 01:27:58,602
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1008
01:27:59,433 --> 01:28:03,646
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1009
01:28:03,726 --> 01:28:06,649
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1010
01:28:07,029 --> 01:28:15,115
Look, see what I see,
the earth afloat..

1011
01:28:15,195 --> 01:28:23,452
..earth dissolving in water
gushing from who knows where.

1012
01:28:23,542 --> 01:28:32,459
Then my sky breaks free of
the earth at the horizon

1013
01:28:32,549 --> 01:28:36,503
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1014
01:28:36,593 --> 01:28:39,384
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1015
01:28:40,555 --> 01:28:44,719
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1016
01:28:44,809 --> 01:28:47,891
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1017
01:29:23,129 --> 01:29:31,255
No consciousness of what I am
I have no sense of what I'll be

1018
01:29:31,345 --> 01:29:39,302
This time now seems unreal
This can't be happening to me

1019
01:29:39,352 --> 01:29:47,519
You slowly dissolve in
me I slowly fade into you

1020
01:29:47,609 --> 01:29:56,605
Our feet stop and our paths shift.

1021
01:29:57,947 --> 01:30:06,243
The sky rolls over
on its bed of clouds.

1022
01:30:06,323 --> 01:30:14,040
The sky will melt and
pelt the earth with rain.

1023
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:22,717
The earth dips its
toes in the water.

1024
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:30,513
It just might stumble to its
feet and start strolling around.

1025
01:30:31,513 --> 01:30:35,517
Soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit.

1026
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,439
Soft, slow, tip-toeing, love.

1027
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:43,854
Soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit.

1028
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:46,775
Soft, slow, tip-toeing, love.

1029
01:31:24,186 --> 01:31:32,271
Say the word, and I stop.
Say the word, and I move.

1030
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:36,685
If this is
obsession that consumes me,

1031
01:31:36,775 --> 01:31:40,688
let it set the
yardstick for obsession.

1032
01:31:40,778 --> 01:31:48,655
Say the word, and I stop.
Say the word, and I move.

1033
01:31:48,745 --> 01:31:57,623
A stranger to my destinations,
I go where you want me to.

1034
01:31:59,123 --> 01:32:07,419
Look, above me, the
sky's soared away.

1035
01:32:07,509 --> 01:32:15,386
I see the sky breaking free
of the earth at the horizon.

1036
01:32:15,476 --> 01:32:23,643
Look, see what I see,
the earth afloat..

1037
01:32:23,733 --> 01:32:32,109
..earth dissolving in water
gushing from who knows where.

1038
01:32:32,649 --> 01:32:36,733
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1039
01:32:36,823 --> 01:32:39,946
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1040
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:44,830
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1041
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:48,083
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1042
01:32:48,953 --> 01:32:53,167
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1043
01:32:53,257 --> 01:32:56,629
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1044
01:32:57,259 --> 01:33:01,302
soft, slow, on tip-toe
bit by thieving bit..

1045
01:33:01,382 --> 01:33:04,555
soft, slow, tip-toeing my love

1046
01:33:09,429 --> 01:33:16,605
Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's
Each other's forever they'll be

1047
01:33:17,565 --> 01:33:22,399
Babli is Bunty's
and Bunty is Babli's.

1048
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:27,193
Each other's forever..
- They'll be

1049
01:33:32,617 --> 01:33:36,871
They began their lives.. in small
sleepy towns, towns they detested

1050
01:33:37,951 --> 01:33:42,745
So they popped up in big cities
doing the kind of things I detested

1051
01:33:44,047 --> 01:33:48,841
Not for poverty, need or
misfortune. Only for fun

1052
01:33:49,881 --> 01:33:53,545
Turning to crime for fun? I'd
never ever heard that before

1053
01:33:54,465 --> 01:33:57,927
News of Bunty-Babli's capers
poured in from all quarters..

1054
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:02,141
dripping into my ears
like red hot molten iron

1055
01:34:03,643 --> 01:34:04,973
Girls and boys in
schools and colleges..

1056
01:34:05,063 --> 01:34:06,554
..began to idolize
them as new age heroes

1057
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,358
Constantly breathing
down their necks..

1058
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:13,269
..I even started
to think like them..

1059
01:34:13,771 --> 01:34:18,023
what next, their next sharp turn?
My hunches were hitting bull's eye..

1060
01:34:19,735 --> 01:34:24,409
and I was inching closer to
them with every passing day

1061
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:30,704
They took their infamy for success
and quickly jumped from cons to scams

1062
01:34:31,034 --> 01:34:35,327
Scams no one had ever
heard of or imagined before

1063
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:42,633
Okay, how about Kerala?
- Too hot

1064
01:34:42,713 --> 01:34:45,636
Manali?
- No, it is too cold

1065
01:34:46,096 --> 01:34:48,889
Jaipur?
- It's too dusty

1066
01:34:48,969 --> 01:34:52,551
Ladakh?
- It's too lonely, Harry

1067
01:34:52,641 --> 01:34:56,594
How many times am I gonna tell you,
it's a damn historical monument..

1068
01:34:56,644 --> 01:34:59,647
not a hotel which I can rent

1069
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:02,809
That's your problem Harry,
you said if we came to India..

1070
01:35:02,899 --> 01:35:07,152
I could get married wherever
I want. This is what I want

1071
01:35:07,232 --> 01:35:09,235
You are impossible

1072
01:35:09,315 --> 01:35:11,736
Am I.. I am?
- Yes

1073
01:35:11,816 --> 01:35:15,950
Really? Fine!
- Yes

1074
01:35:28,749 --> 01:35:32,332
Do you see what I see?
- I'm not blind

1075
01:35:32,422 --> 01:35:35,625
Do you hear what I hear?
- I'm not deaf

1076
01:35:36,046 --> 01:35:38,217
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1077
01:35:38,547 --> 01:35:41,840
I'm no mind reader. Get to the point

1078
01:35:45,723 --> 01:35:50,887
Protesters.. thirty. Taxi drivers?
- Four

1079
01:35:51,348 --> 01:35:54,811
School children?
- Twenty. With one teacher

1080
01:35:56,562 --> 01:35:58,603
Newspaper?
- Agra Times

1081
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:02,947
Minister's office.
- Very good!

1082
01:36:03,407 --> 01:36:08,491
And a wedding bash.
- Oye Rakesh! A first round knockout

1083
01:36:12,534 --> 01:36:15,747
I want to marry there Harry,
not put it in my living room

1084
01:36:15,827 --> 01:36:18,039
I told you it's not possible Kate

1085
01:36:18,919 --> 01:36:20,831
Selling Taj..
- Never, never

1086
01:36:20,921 --> 01:36:22,662
Government don't be..
- Clever clever

1087
01:36:22,712 --> 01:36:24,503
Selling Taj..
- Never, never

1088
01:36:24,585 --> 01:36:26,376
Government don't be..
- Clever clever

1089
01:36:26,466 --> 01:36:28,217
Selling Taj..
- Never, never

1090
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:30,379
Government don't be..
- Clever clever

1091
01:36:30,469 --> 01:36:34,471
My car.. Mercedes.. Mercedes..
- Mercedes stuck in traffic jam

1092
01:36:35,513 --> 01:36:38,175
Students protesting Taj sale.
- What sale?

1093
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:41,478
The Taj is on sale. Sir this
is my Mercedes. Please sit

1094
01:36:42,598 --> 01:36:46,021
Please sir.. the
government is selling the Taj.

1095
01:36:48,063 --> 01:36:49,775
We won't let them sell it

1096
01:36:59,401 --> 01:37:01,323
Extremely sorry sir, I apologise

1097
01:37:01,403 --> 01:37:03,285
Today's newspaper sir?

1098
01:37:06,538 --> 01:37:08,078
Thank you so much, sir

1099
01:37:17,216 --> 01:37:20,299
Is the Taj Mahal really
up for sale? - Yes sir

1100
01:37:20,379 --> 01:37:21,630
By who?

1101
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,841
By him, sir

1102
01:37:27,424 --> 01:37:28,765
Excuse me

1103
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:33,058
Hold on

1104
01:37:40,685 --> 01:37:45,399
No sir, it is not possible. We cannot
sell Taj Mahal to a foreigner

1105
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:49,691
Even if the price is high?

1106
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:53,905
No price is too high for Taj Mahal

1107
01:37:55,075 --> 01:37:57,488
How about 100 million dollars?
- No sir

1108
01:37:57,578 --> 01:37:59,869
150 million.
- No sir

1109
01:38:01,912 --> 01:38:06,996
175 million.
- Sir, I told you, it's not possible

1110
01:38:07,086 --> 01:38:09,337
200 million.

1111
01:38:11,759 --> 01:38:14,841
Well.. 250 million

1112
01:38:23,678 --> 01:38:25,471
Why don't you speak with her?

1113
01:38:27,772 --> 01:38:29,063
Who?

1114
01:38:31,355 --> 01:38:32,816
Phoolsakhi'ji

1115
01:38:33,776 --> 01:38:35,819
Who is Phoolsakhi'ji?

1116
01:38:35,859 --> 01:38:37,400
Phoolsakhi'ji

1117
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:43,194
Minister in charge of purchase
and selling of the Taj Mahal

1118
01:38:52,952 --> 01:38:55,083
Where's the typist?
She's down with viral fever.

1119
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:56,705
We're getting another typist

1120
01:38:56,795 --> 01:38:59,917
Get her quickly. - l'll be
in the office all day today

1121
01:38:59,997 --> 01:39:01,499
Let's pack in as much
corruption as we can today

1122
01:39:01,589 --> 01:39:04,131
Of course.
- The typist is here madam'ji

1123
01:39:07,754 --> 01:39:08,964
Sit

1124
01:39:13,968 --> 01:39:18,052
My niece's doctoral thesis. I
want it typed out by this evening

How long have you been in
government? - Not very long

1130
01:40:14,557 --> 01:40:18,690
And the minister?
- Not very long either

1131
01:40:24,815 --> 01:40:26,947
Sir..

1132
01:40:27,367 --> 01:40:29,068
You brought the other money?

1133
01:40:32,871 --> 01:40:36,865
I can't believe! Someone is
actually selling the Taj Mahal

1134
01:40:39,787 --> 01:40:42,919
Nor can I believe!
Someone is actually buying

1135
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:45,871
This ass is going to get kicked

1136
01:40:45,921 --> 01:40:47,833
Crowshit on your egghead

1137
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:57,131
He'll be crying for help in two days

1138
01:41:03,095 --> 01:41:05,307
How do I look?
- Very fine

1139
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:26,653
How are you madam?

1140
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:29,116
Would you believe l've
been dying to see you?

1141
01:41:30,997 --> 01:41:34,580
Madam, this is Mr. Harry Epstein

1142
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:36,873
He wants to buy the Taj Mahal

1143
01:41:36,923 --> 01:41:38,373
Exactly

1144
01:41:39,924 --> 01:41:41,335
I'm not selling

1145
01:41:43,588 --> 01:41:46,219
But madam, we had a deal..
- Why are you late?

1146
01:41:46,589 --> 01:41:48,381
But ma'am.. Shut up

1147
01:41:48,882 --> 01:41:51,473
So you can't sell
the Taj Mahal to me?

1148
01:41:53,556 --> 01:41:55,677
It's all a big mistake

1149
01:41:56,517 --> 01:41:58,930
And you have wasted my time

1150
01:42:00,601 --> 01:42:01,771
One minute

1151
01:42:05,815 --> 01:42:12,861
I said l can't sell the Taj Mahal but
it doesn't mean you can't have it

1152
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:14,942
I don't understand

1153
01:42:18,115 --> 01:42:20,907
You can lease it on rent

1154
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,581
For how long?

1155
01:42:26,331 --> 01:42:28,373

01:43:02,991 --> 01:43:05,032
The revolution..

We demand that Ms Kalasakhi..

Tell them!
- You've got the address wrong

1175
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:53,441
She is Ms Phoolsakhi. Now get out.

Okay. Sorry. Fine. Relax. Don't mind

What happened to this elevator?
- Could be stuck somewhere

1183
01:44:24,716 --> 01:44:25,846
It's coming.
- Let's go

1184
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:27,137
Finished?
- Nearly

1185
01:45:15,926 --> 01:45:19,009
It sure is nice of Mr. Bunty to throw
us this wonderful wedding party

1186
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:24,513
And you! Thank you,
it's a dream come true

1187
01:45:29,977 --> 01:45:31,478
Not possible

1188
01:45:31,688 --> 01:45:35,732
What do you mean not-possible,
I own the Taj Mahal

1189
01:45:35,942 --> 01:45:39,065
Is he nuts? He says
he owns the Taj Mahal!

1190
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:42,067
Poor thing, God can
really be cruel sometimes

1191
01:45:43,277 --> 01:45:47,951
Open the gate before I
fire you.. dismiss you

1192
01:45:48,161 --> 01:45:51,074
Dismiss? He says
he'll get us dismissed

1193
01:45:51,374 --> 01:45:54,167
Doctor? You need one?
We call doctor?

1194
01:45:54,207 --> 01:45:58,419
No doctor! You talk to Mr. Bunty

1195
01:45:58,961 --> 01:46:00,792
He wants some Bunty fellow

1196
01:46:01,462 --> 01:46:03,965
What Bunty? Hey wait a
minute are they Bunty and Babli?

1197
01:46:40,363 --> 01:46:41,364
So finally you arrive!

1198
01:46:42,114 --> 01:46:45,457
They sold the Taj and scooted while
you stood by and watched it happen?

1199
01:46:45,958 --> 01:46:49,541
Tomorrow when you sell it
again l'll still be left watching

1200
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:52,162
What!
- Look madam..

1201
01:46:54,085 --> 01:46:55,836
a bull doesn't budge until
he sees red in his face..

1202
01:46:55,926 --> 01:46:59,089
..and it takes a scam to prod me
into action. l just got the news, no?

1203
01:46:59,299 --> 01:47:02,170
That's no way to talk.
- Really? And how did they talk?

1204
01:47:02,721 --> 01:47:07,805
Go on, file your report about
descriptions, characteristics

1205
01:47:08,685 --> 01:47:10,387
Stop staring at me and do it

1206
01:47:16,102 --> 01:47:20,185
No one could've pulled off this
caper without the help of insiders

1207
01:47:20,485 --> 01:47:23,067
Who could it be?
- Could've been you, madam

1208
01:47:23,857 --> 01:47:25,899
You left her alone in
the room at a perfect time

1209
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:32,194
Corruption happens at the top floor.

1210
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:36,698
But one has to climb
from the ground floor

1211
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:43,203
There's a saying amongst us
policemen. Orderlies make more..

1212
01:47:43,333 --> 01:47:46,416
..under the table

1213
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:52,210
See son..

1214
01:47:53,421 --> 01:47:55,763
you shouldn't have
gone to the wedding..

1215
01:47:56,804 --> 01:48:00,387
..that too in a new car. Getting it?

1216
01:48:09,855 --> 01:48:13,477
Hey trumpet.
- Yes sir?

1217
01:48:13,857 --> 01:48:15,229
What's the most
requested song nowadays?

1218
01:48:17,530 --> 01:48:21,484
Babu'ji, slow it down now

1219
01:48:23,405 --> 01:48:24,655
Stand up here

1220
01:48:27,408 --> 01:48:28,739
Play

1221
01:48:39,047 --> 01:48:41,920
I heard you took an
American to his wedding altar

1222
01:48:46,804 --> 01:48:47,754
No sir

1223
01:48:48,715 --> 01:48:53,309
I know their names. I
want to know where they are

1224
01:49:00,895 --> 01:49:05,269
Harry says, he was so smooth,
and convincing. Harry's no fool

1225
01:49:05,779 --> 01:49:07,400
And you believed?
- I did

1226
01:49:07,730 --> 01:49:11,774
It was in the Times of lndia.
- All newspapers say..

1227
01:49:11,864 --> 01:49:14,405
all Americans have sex
all the day, I believe?

1228
01:49:15,697 --> 01:49:20,911
Don't look at it, you
hear me? Don't look at it

1229
01:49:21,161 --> 01:49:24,333
Sir how about leaving? What
can we possibly get to know here?

1230
01:49:24,583 --> 01:49:27,246
Here you learn to what
lengths a man can go..

1231
01:49:27,296 --> 01:49:29,747
..for the smallest of things

1232
01:49:31,299 --> 01:49:34,291
Get the serial numbers
of the currency that..

1233
01:49:34,381 --> 01:49:35,843
..he withdrew from his bank

1234
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:38,635
Tell me joke

1235
01:49:39,425 --> 01:49:40,095
Non-veg

1236
01:49:53,977 --> 01:49:58,560
Tired of turning wheels? Now
watch how the wheels of fortune turn

1237
01:49:59,021 --> 01:50:04,735
I didn't see a thing. What can
I say? I'm a simple honest man

1238
01:50:04,945 --> 01:50:10,531
God! This one turns out to be
honest! Wheel back that car..

1239
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:14,953
go on.. back out..

1240
01:50:15,493 --> 01:50:18,416
go away, far away

1241
01:50:19,247 --> 01:50:21,129
There. Stop

1242
01:50:21,629 --> 01:50:25,381
The longer the distance, the
more it looks like an accident

1243
01:50:25,421 --> 01:50:29,545
Don't move or l'll shoot.
- Sir, what are you saying?

1244
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:34,259
I told you! I saw nothing.
- No one's ever seen..

1245
01:50:34,389 --> 01:50:36,391
what's about to happen right now

1246
01:50:37,602 --> 01:50:40,725
Come on, slam the car.
- No.. please

1247
01:50:40,855 --> 01:50:45,437
Slam him. - Please! No.. I saw,
I saw! I saw everything

1248
01:50:45,517 --> 01:50:46,769
Turn off the engine

1249
01:50:47,269 --> 01:50:49,401
Stand straight

1250
01:50:51,023 --> 01:50:58,158
See no evil. Speak no evil. Hear no
evil but if you can profit, grab it

1251
01:50:58,698 --> 01:51:00,861
Gandhi'ji would've come
here personally to whack you..

1252
01:51:00,951 --> 01:51:02,491
..for being so honest

1253
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:07,746
Who else was in it with them?
Go on, give him every detail

1254
01:51:08,326 --> 01:51:12,329
What's wrong? Why are you sulking?
You're upset with me?

1255
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:16,833
Moron, the Taj got sold, not
your taxi. Like some nuts?

1256
01:51:17,423 --> 01:51:17,874
No?
- Suit yourself

1257
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:22,627
There was no corner of the country
Bunty and Babli hadn't been to

1258
01:51:22,888 --> 01:51:26,971
And every newspaper was
cheering their ingenuity

1259
01:51:27,341 --> 01:51:31,845
But I was dying to
see them behind bars

1260
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:36,729
No there's no
mistake about this order.

1261
01:51:36,809 --> 01:51:38,100
Your assignment is being changed

1262
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:42,483
But I've completely
committed myself to the case

1263
01:51:43,154 --> 01:51:45,815
Bunty-Babli's case is being
assigned to the federal agencies

1264
01:51:45,905 --> 01:51:47,817
To whom?
- Federal investigation

1265
01:51:48,198 --> 01:51:49,398
God

1266
01:51:50,659 --> 01:51:52,821
Our politicians have become honest?

1267
01:51:53,072 --> 01:51:54,863
The feds have time
for Bunty and Babli?

1268
01:51:55,113 --> 01:51:57,785
They have your sympathies?
- Not those two

1269
01:51:57,865 --> 01:52:03,120
My sympathies are with the feds.
- You think the feds can't get them?

1270
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:07,333
Why?
- Because they can't think like them

1271
01:52:07,543 --> 01:52:09,374
And you can?

1272
01:52:09,755 --> 01:52:12,507
I'm beginning to feel
we're related somehow

1273
01:52:15,469 --> 01:52:20,423
From tomorrow, you're taking
charge of the gold at the airport

1274
01:52:26,187 --> 01:52:27,269
Very well sir

1275
01:52:28,190 --> 01:52:29,680
You're the boss

1276
01:52:30,521 --> 01:52:33,023
I'll take charge of
hell if you want me to

1277
01:52:33,484 --> 01:52:36,395
Anyway what's the score?
- What?

1278
01:52:37,277 --> 01:52:39,318
I found myself a
night-watchman's job.

1279
01:52:39,568 --> 01:52:41,319
This is how I got to bide my time

1280
01:52:42,451 --> 01:52:44,532
Dashrath Singh..

1281
01:52:46,533 --> 01:52:50,247
If there's anybody who'll lay a
finger on Bunty and Babli, it's me

1282
01:53:04,588 --> 01:53:08,512
You find this funny? You can
do this yourself the next time

1283
01:53:08,672 --> 01:53:10,713
I won't be able to do
this even if I tried, love

1284
01:53:11,805 --> 01:53:14,466
But you can make a
mockery of those who do?

1285
01:53:15,056 --> 01:53:20,931
Ok, I'm sorry - What idiot
could've made you a father

1286
01:53:22,683 --> 01:53:23,934
You

1287
01:53:27,897 --> 01:53:31,279
One rum, large

1288
01:53:31,609 --> 01:53:34,072
You don't need to pay sir

1289
01:53:34,322 --> 01:53:36,693
Did I mention I'm a policeman?
- Hear me out, sir

1290
01:53:37,035 --> 01:53:40,236
The gentleman out there is
hosting food and drinks..

1291
01:53:40,327 --> 01:53:41,787
..for all guests tonight

1292
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:44,950
Who?
- The man in black

1293
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:47,243
They're buying this restaurant

1294
01:53:47,543 --> 01:53:51,795
No way. We're picking up
the tab for everyone tonight

1295
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:54,838
Not tonight. Tomorrow

1296
01:53:55,338 --> 01:53:59,172
From tomorrow, this hotel is
yours to do as you please.

1297
01:53:59,462 --> 01:54:01,923
But tonight's on me

1298
01:54:02,425 --> 01:54:10,601
Friends, cocktails and
dinner for everyone on the house

1299
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:15,605
Vodka
- Yes Sir.

1300
01:54:17,317 --> 01:54:18,357
Vodka.

1301
01:54:19,318 --> 01:54:19,978
Whiskey

1302
01:54:21,819 --> 01:54:24,152
Cocktail?
- Sir.

1303
01:54:24,532 --> 01:54:26,483
Gin
- Okay.

1304
01:54:29,036 --> 01:54:30,026
Gin.

1305
01:54:30,236 --> 01:54:31,327
Rum

1306
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,830
Flying to the moon?

1307
01:54:36,451 --> 01:54:39,033
You're selling the tickets?

1308
01:54:39,874 --> 01:54:41,495
You've just bought
yourself a one-way ticket

1309
01:54:43,707 --> 01:54:47,631
I don't believe much in
buying tickets but yes..

1310
01:54:47,711 --> 01:54:51,213
..I do want to fly to the moon

1311
01:54:51,673 --> 01:54:52,755
You're a man in a hurry?

1312
01:54:54,346 --> 01:54:55,887
Somewhat

1313
01:54:58,009 --> 01:55:01,101
There's this one place in
which men-in-a-hurry usually end up

1314
01:55:07,565 --> 01:55:09,398
You see..
- What?

1315
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:15,272
This world we live in
has two kinds of people

1316
01:55:15,522 --> 01:55:18,695
I see.
- One, the kind that listens

1317
01:55:19,366 --> 01:55:25,370
And the kind that talks.
I belong to the latter

1318
01:55:28,083 --> 01:55:33,787
So sure of yourself?
What do you do? - Cleaning

1319
01:55:36,839 --> 01:55:40,082
I'm in the cleaning business.
We clean out places

1320
01:55:40,752 --> 01:55:43,585
What kind of places?
- Any kind

1321
01:55:45,096 --> 01:55:50,260
So you like tidy places?
- No, I like tidy sums of money

1322
01:55:53,643 --> 01:55:57,845
Interesting man. Where
are you from? - Allahabad

1323
01:55:58,477 --> 01:56:01,939
Aha, you look that type

1324
01:56:02,439 --> 01:56:04,231
Sir, one more large?

1325
01:56:05,482 --> 01:56:07,313
Bring it on then

1326
01:56:08,985 --> 01:56:11,356
What's happening here?

1327
01:56:11,447 --> 01:56:15,990
You're smoking in front of your
baby? - How the hell can he see me?

1328
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:18,573
Babies know everything.
- How can they know everything?

1329
01:56:18,623 --> 01:56:19,783
Stop it

1330
01:56:20,914 --> 01:56:25,288
I get the feeling l'm her baby

1331
01:56:25,878 --> 01:56:27,499
And he who is he?

1332
01:56:27,629 --> 01:56:29,041
I.. am..
- He is..

1333
01:56:29,171 --> 01:56:31,793
Whoever, doesn't matter. Come on

1334
01:56:31,883 --> 01:56:35,756
Women.. are like this only. -
How and how do you think women are?

1335
01:56:36,506 --> 01:56:41,090
Oye, don't stoke my anger.
- Hello, what's happening here?

1336
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:45,554
A fight can't you see?
- That I can, but why?

1337
01:56:45,844 --> 01:56:50,308
Private matters of husband-wife!
How meddlesome

1338
01:56:50,438 --> 01:56:52,269
Please stub that out

1339
01:56:52,599 --> 01:56:54,981
You look like a long lost father!

1340
01:56:55,232 --> 01:56:56,813
Ought to be setting
an example for him

1341
01:56:57,233 --> 01:57:00,736
And you better come along. I'm
checking out the rooms in this hotel

1342
01:57:01,907 --> 01:57:03,489
Don't take too long

1343
01:57:06,951 --> 01:57:09,743
Don't come back in an hour or two.

1344
01:57:09,953 --> 01:57:11,454
Spoilt the mood for
no rhyme or reason

1345
01:57:12,285 --> 01:57:14,577
You seem to be much fallen-in-love

1346
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:22,873
You've never fallen.. in love?

1347
01:57:27,927 --> 01:57:29,589
Once, a little

1348
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,381
What?

1349
01:57:33,591 --> 01:57:35,223
A little

1350
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:46,142
In a summer of Delhi I came upon her

1351
01:57:47,233 --> 01:57:51,526
Every single day on bus number 481 ..

1352
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:54,359
I would fall all over myself
to vacate the ladies' seat..

1353
01:57:54,449 --> 01:57:57,651
and she would sit down
with the sweetest smile

1354
01:58:00,824 --> 01:58:03,695
For a whole year..
- You never spoke?

1355
01:58:04,327 --> 01:58:10,541
When our eyes were saying so much
how could words dare to interfere?

1356
01:58:13,253 --> 01:58:14,335
But..

1357
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:19,549
I can shower her
with gifts, can't l?

1358
01:58:19,919 --> 01:58:25,673
So every week, I'd fall over
myself to give her my gift

1359
01:58:25,724 --> 01:58:27,425
And she..
- Would smile?

1360
01:58:27,515 --> 01:58:29,097
And take it
- Yes.

1361
01:58:29,427 --> 01:58:33,599
And l'm sure that one day, in return
for all my gifts she would give me..

1362
01:58:33,729 --> 01:58:39,855
that one big gift I've been waiting
for. - So did the gift arrive?

1363
01:58:39,985 --> 01:58:41,776
Winter arrived

1364
01:58:44,489 --> 01:58:46,320
On the 21st of December..

1365
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:51,694
wrapped in a maroon
shawl and a warm smile..

1366
01:58:51,744 --> 01:58:54,737
she stepped into the bus. Radiance
on her face and in her hands..

1367
01:58:54,827 --> 01:59:01,662
a Golden Bakery box.
Inside that box..

1368
01:59:02,202 --> 01:59:07,997
were the world's most
beautiful heart shaped.. you know..

1369
01:59:10,089 --> 01:59:12,420
heart-shaped pastries

1370
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:14,001
Wow!
- Yes.

1371
01:59:15,303 --> 01:59:19,597
And then for the
first time in a year..

1372
01:59:21,638 --> 01:59:25,141
she spoke her first words to me

1373
01:59:30,685 --> 01:59:32,516
Please..

1374
01:59:33,777 --> 01:59:37,981
would you distribute these
pastries to all the passengers

1375
01:59:38,071 --> 01:59:40,773
I just got engaged

1376
01:59:47,989 --> 01:59:48,949
Sorry.

1377
01:59:49,039 --> 01:59:51,081
Ei handsome
- Yes!

1378
01:59:52,993 --> 01:59:54,745
What happened?

1379
02:00:18,353 --> 02:00:19,855
She's calling you

1380
02:00:21,606 --> 02:00:22,896
Who is?

1381
02:00:23,227 --> 02:00:26,559
Tonight's your night

1382
02:00:30,403 --> 02:00:36,157
Those pangs you feel in
your heart have pained me too

1383
02:00:38,158 --> 02:00:42,742
Why not drown our pains tonight?

1384
02:00:44,083 --> 02:00:45,705
Nice

1385
02:00:53,501 --> 02:01:00,677
Rare are those moments
in life when desire calls

1386
02:01:03,428 --> 02:01:07,762
Come into my arms, or
come and slit my throat

1387
02:01:20,313 --> 02:01:21,943
Oh forget it..

1388
02:01:22,314 --> 02:01:25,607
this give and take of
hearts takes a lot of heart..

1389
02:01:25,697 --> 02:01:31,571
and doing it so boldly for the world
to see.. it's a woman's art you see

1390
02:01:32,412 --> 02:01:35,455
In this winning and losing
of hearts what are men worth?

1391
02:01:39,207 --> 02:01:45,421
His ruthless gaze..

1392
02:01:45,883 --> 02:01:51,967
tore up the street.. took me apart

1393
02:01:52,718 --> 02:02:04,187
It ran a razor's edge down
the willing side of my heart

1394
02:02:06,349 --> 02:02:12,694
Wow! Wow!

1395
02:02:44,048 --> 02:02:47,632
I fall to restless pieces..

1396
02:02:49,222 --> 02:02:52,515
don't look at me that way

1397
02:02:54,266 --> 02:02:59,310
I fall to restless pieces,
don't look at me that way

1398
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:09,779
A townful of men in ruin
surrenders to what I say

1399
02:03:09,859 --> 02:03:15,033
I fall to restless pieces,
don't look at me that way

1400
02:03:15,113 --> 02:03:20,247
A townful of men in ruin
surrenders to what I say

1401
02:03:20,327 --> 02:03:26,663
I stretch with desire,
I take my bow

1402
02:03:26,753 --> 02:03:29,705
I stretch with desire..

1403
02:03:29,795 --> 02:03:31,045
come touch me now

1404
02:03:31,125 --> 02:03:38,882
Night eyes..

1405
02:03:38,972 --> 02:03:43,766
night eyes.. your night eyes..

1406
02:03:54,274 --> 02:03:59,728
The moon sleeps
inside those night eyes

1407
02:03:59,859 --> 02:04:05,283
Night eyes, your night eyes
Night falls inside those night eyes

1408
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:37,639
These sighs you swore,
wrote them in kohl

1409
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:43,604
Come to life inside these eyes

1410
02:04:43,684 --> 02:04:48,978
That kiss you left
on my handkerchief

1411
02:04:49,648 --> 02:04:53,612
I knot it until it dies

1412
02:04:54,282 --> 02:04:56,905
Oh your words are
wisps from incense bowls

1413
02:04:56,985 --> 02:04:59,576
You waft in lazy
like the warm wind rolls

1414
02:04:59,656 --> 02:05:02,279
Oh your words are
wisps from incense bowls

1415
02:05:02,409 --> 02:05:05,241
You waft in lazy
like the warm wind rolls

1416
02:05:05,331 --> 02:05:09,784
I bow, I stretch.. come touch me

1417
02:05:09,874 --> 02:05:20,673
I stretch with desire,
I take my bow

1418
02:05:20,753 --> 02:05:44,062
night eyes.. your night eyes..

1419
02:05:44,112 --> 02:05:49,236
Night eyes, my night eyes
You're a shadow inside my night eyes

1420
02:05:49,326 --> 02:05:54,870
night eyes.. your night eyes..

1421
02:06:23,683 --> 02:06:32,149
Ask private questions, brook no lies

1422
02:06:34,191 --> 02:06:38,445
Hide under those veil-like lids

1423
02:06:39,446 --> 02:06:43,159
The curtains behind which she shies

1424
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:54,918
No curtains hide my pain,
no lies try to guard me

1425
02:06:55,038 --> 02:06:59,872
I bow, I stretch.. come touch me

1426
02:06:59,962 --> 02:07:10,340
I stretch with desire, I take my bow

1427
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:44,707
night eyes.. your night eyes..

1428
02:07:56,967 --> 02:08:00,340
You are mine in the
memories of old stone cities

1429
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:03,553
Our songs still echo
in those forlorn cities

1430
02:08:03,633 --> 02:08:06,885
From the south gate arch to
where the north gate lies..

1431
02:08:07,015 --> 02:08:10,058
you and I are lore
set in stone cities

1432
02:08:10,138 --> 02:08:14,431
I hear the call of
the saint on the wall

1433
02:08:14,521 --> 02:08:18,855
And swear by the
black beauty of your eyes

1434
02:08:18,945 --> 02:08:23,569
I'm the guardian from
evil your eyes never had

1435
02:08:23,649 --> 02:08:28,111
I'll suffuse them with
smiles so they never look sad

1436
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:30,033
Oh your words are
wisps from incense bowls

1437
02:08:30,154 --> 02:08:31,995
You waft in lazy
like the warm wind rolls

1438
02:08:32,115 --> 02:08:34,287
Oh your words are
wisps from incense bowls

1439
02:08:34,407 --> 02:08:36,698
You waft in lazy
like the warm wind rolls

1440
02:08:36,789 --> 02:08:45,296
Come touch me, oh
touch me, oh touch me now

1441
02:08:45,376 --> 02:09:22,735
night eyes.. your night eyes..

1442
02:09:38,627 --> 02:09:42,631
I love the way you sway

1443
02:09:43,051 --> 02:09:46,634
Madam, I am your only Adam

1444
02:09:46,764 --> 02:09:53,509
Night eyes.. oh the dark
of her nights in my eyes

1445
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:58,063
Why do you dole out free drinks?

1446
02:09:58,563 --> 02:10:06,150
Why give free drinks, you fool!
How will you run your hotel?

1447
02:10:10,153 --> 02:10:11,404
Anyway..

1448
02:10:12,655 --> 02:10:15,617
I enjoyed your company

1449
02:10:17,448 --> 02:10:22,913
I feel satisfied
and a little in love

1450
02:10:23,743 --> 02:10:31,670
And it helped me forget those two

1451
02:10:34,503 --> 02:10:41,678
Forget them.. you've nothing
to do with those scoundrels

1452
02:10:47,182 --> 02:10:49,605
Generally..

1453
02:10:54,267 --> 02:10:57,981
I don't take to strangers too well

1454
02:10:59,733 --> 02:11:02,234
But I don't know..

1455
02:11:04,867 --> 02:11:07,778
I don't know why
the two of you have..

1456
02:11:08,119 --> 02:11:13,663
..touched my heart

1457
02:11:16,416 --> 02:11:20,039
We've done what?
- Touched my heart..

1458
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:26,544
you could've been my children

1459
02:11:28,255 --> 02:11:31,718
You haven't told us your name.
- You haven't told..

1460
02:11:32,388 --> 02:11:34,639
My name is Dashrath

1461
02:11:35,641 --> 02:11:41,305
Dashrath Singh, Deputy
Commissioner of Police

1462
02:11:41,395 --> 02:11:42,976
You're a police' wallah?

1463
02:11:46,189 --> 02:11:50,063
What did you think? Balloon' wallah?

1464
02:11:54,445 --> 02:11:56,407
Why what's come over you?

1465
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:00,201
What's it?
- Rickshaw' wallah..

1466
02:12:00,281 --> 02:12:01,992
Sit in the rickshaw

1467
02:12:02,072 --> 02:12:05,165
Go on, take him home.
- Yes, take me home

1468
02:12:05,245 --> 02:12:07,366
It's very late.
- Very late at night

1469
02:12:07,496 --> 02:12:10,619
Take me to the airport..

1470
02:12:10,709 --> 02:12:14,081
no not there

1471
02:12:14,631 --> 02:12:21,257
I'm going to Police Lines.
- Go on, quick

1472
02:12:29,723 --> 02:12:33,847
Oh my God, the very same Dashrath
Singh the one who's been after us?

1473
02:12:35,559 --> 02:12:40,353
My baby almost had a heart attack!
That was close, let's get out of here

1474
02:12:40,733 --> 02:12:48,198
Get out? The fun's only just begun
- What are you talking about?

1475
02:12:51,201 --> 02:12:57,536
Look, he never knew what we look
like. He still doesn't. But now..

1476
02:12:58,366 --> 02:13:02,790
we know who he is
and we also know that..

1477
02:13:03,751 --> 02:13:08,544
he's in charge of the security
of the gold stashed at the airport

1478
02:13:10,877 --> 02:13:14,419
By God! You are..
- Vimmi, if we don't..

1479
02:13:14,509 --> 02:13:17,091
steal the meat right
from the lion's den..

1480
02:13:17,182 --> 02:13:21,095
what did we achieve?
- Your hunger's getting out of hand

1481
02:13:23,636 --> 02:13:29,431
Now we're a threesome. We'll
need more food.. what do you say?

1482
02:13:31,233 --> 02:13:32,644
You'll get us killed someday

1483
02:13:39,399 --> 02:13:41,941
India's Central Bank doesn't
keep its gold in any one place

1484
02:13:42,071 --> 02:13:45,785
To protect the gold from fires,
floods or earthquakes..

1485
02:13:45,905 --> 02:13:48,246
the cache is split
over four different cities

1486
02:13:48,786 --> 02:13:51,409
Depending on the requirements
of various banks..

1487
02:13:51,499 --> 02:13:55,451
this gold is shuttled by air between
these four cities once every week

1488
02:13:57,123 --> 02:14:01,417
How they cracked this confidential
information, they haven't divulged

1489
02:14:02,508 --> 02:14:07,051
But what they did that day no
one could have ever imagined

1490
02:14:08,092 --> 02:14:09,012
Not even me..

1491
02:14:12,385 --> 02:14:16,809
Delhi-Mumbai, 9.10 pm tonight.
Korpal, Puneet, Mr.

1492
02:14:16,889 --> 02:14:23,564
And Delhi-Calcutta, 9.40 pm.
Sharma, Vandana, Mrs.

1493
02:14:24,685 --> 02:14:27,607
What's this other ticket for?
- Backup

1494
02:14:29,489 --> 02:14:39,497
-=MTR=-

1495
02:14:41,789 --> 02:14:44,991
Why the Air Traffic Control number?
- Backup

1496
02:14:45,661 --> 02:14:51,547
A back up for everything? Oye
Rakesh, is there one for you too?

1497
02:14:53,008 --> 02:14:54,879
Yes
- Who?

1498
02:14:56,551 --> 02:14:57,842
You

1499
02:15:00,093 --> 02:15:01,053
Smart

1500
02:16:46,637 --> 02:16:50,841
Call back the Jet airways flight
to Mumbai. The bomb is ticking

1501
02:16:50,931 --> 02:16:54,594
What nonsense. A bomb on the plane?

1502
02:17:00,609 --> 02:17:03,271
Jet 9W312. Yes Delhi Control?

1503
02:17:03,481 --> 02:17:07,275
Turn back and proceed for
landing on emergency runway number 2

1504
02:17:07,365 --> 02:17:08,856
There is a bomb scare

1505
02:17:08,946 --> 02:17:10,406
Delhi Control is this a joke?

1506
02:17:10,487 --> 02:17:11,567
Bomb on board, he says

1507
02:17:11,657 --> 02:17:13,739
Jet 9W312. Turning back

1508
02:17:20,785 --> 02:17:22,035
The caller's number. Get it now

1509
02:17:22,165 --> 02:17:24,168
Go get the number from them. Now!

1510
02:17:24,248 --> 02:17:26,499
We can't have the number

1511
02:17:26,579 --> 02:17:29,962
It isn't under ourjurisdiction.
- As long as the gold is on board..

1512
02:17:30,082 --> 02:17:32,875
this plane, the bomb, this airport,
everything is under our jurisdiction

1513
02:18:20,082 --> 02:18:23,715
How many people knew about
the gold? - Four bank employees

1514
02:18:23,755 --> 02:18:25,376
Are you implying the news was
leaked? - Give me the key to the box

1515
02:18:25,466 --> 02:18:27,337
But we are not permitted to
open it. - Give me the key

1516
02:18:27,467 --> 02:18:29,970
Now it's your responsibility. - The
bomb might explode any time, sir

1517
02:18:30,050 --> 02:18:33,053
The bomb has exploded.
Send message to headquarters.

1518
02:18:33,383 --> 02:18:35,924
I am assuming command

1519
02:18:51,146 --> 02:18:52,939
DCP Dashrath Singh here..

1520
02:18:53,149 --> 02:18:55,030
Surround the airport area

1521
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:58,533
Locate persons who do not have
any reason to be here at this hour

1522
02:18:59,403 --> 02:19:01,615
Take suspects into
custody and inform immediately

1523
02:19:01,705 --> 02:19:03,827
They received the bomb
scare from this number

1524
02:19:14,716 --> 02:19:16,006
Dial

1525
02:19:20,670 --> 02:19:30,638
Ringing

1526
02:20:38,031 --> 02:20:41,694
Orange Maruti Swift 5700

1527
02:20:47,039 --> 02:20:50,832
Vimmi we'll have to ditch
this car. They've spotted it.

1528
02:20:50,912 --> 02:20:52,373
Get out

1529
02:21:12,809 --> 02:21:14,641
Stop.. taxi

1530
02:21:17,353 --> 02:21:19,645
Stop.. please

1531
02:21:23,437 --> 02:21:25,860
Papa'ji, please help us!

1532
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:28,191
I'll give you more money
than you ever imagined

1533
02:21:28,321 --> 02:21:32,194
Son, for this job, I won't take
money even if you give it to me..

1534
02:21:32,274 --> 02:21:37,028
come my child, get up,
you'll do fine

1535
02:21:37,158 --> 02:21:40,071
Have faith in god. Faith prevails

1536
02:21:40,201 --> 02:21:42,202
Sir, what are you saying?

1537
02:21:42,873 --> 02:21:45,665
Policemen in every
hospital and nursing home?

1538
02:21:45,745 --> 02:21:47,787
We won't have men
for policing the city.

1539
02:21:48,377 --> 02:21:51,830
She's in labour.
She's about to deliver

1540
02:21:53,381 --> 02:21:58,425
Every child born in Delhi
tonight will see a policeman's face..

1541
02:21:58,505 --> 02:22:00,928
before anything else

1542
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:06,892
That Dashrath Singh figured me out.

1543
02:22:07,683 --> 02:22:08,973
How are you so sure?

1544
02:22:09,143 --> 02:22:11,936
I know.

1545
02:22:12,727 --> 02:22:14,267
I saw it in his eyes..

1546
02:22:17,731 --> 02:22:18,851
Then..

1547
02:22:19,151 --> 02:22:23,735
in no time every hospital in Delhi
will be crawling with policemen

1548
02:22:25,197 --> 02:22:28,449
Which hospital do
you want to go to son?

1549
02:22:29,871 --> 02:22:32,612
The biggest.. the
biggest hospital in Delhi

1550
02:22:32,702 --> 02:22:37,746
Not a hospital or nursing home,
they'll go to a nondescript clinic

1551
02:22:38,917 --> 02:22:41,750
If l know that Bunty..

1552
02:22:42,330 --> 02:22:45,833
..he'll definitely take
Babli to the biggest hospital

1553
02:22:51,468 --> 02:22:53,799
Vimmi, don't be afraid

1554
02:22:53,889 --> 02:22:56,682
This hospital is packed choc-a-bloc
with newborns and their mothers

1555
02:22:56,762 --> 02:23:01,346
It'll take them ages to check
each bed. But you please hurry it up

1556
02:23:01,436 --> 02:23:04,477
It isn't in my hands, bloody idiot!

1557
02:23:05,149 --> 02:23:07,850
I told you you'll
get us killed someday

1558
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:09,061
Hush

1559
02:23:09,441 --> 02:23:15,317
But hey, what life did I
have before I met you?

1560
02:23:31,079 --> 02:23:32,960
Is everything all right?
- Yes

1561
02:23:35,293 --> 02:23:36,964
Papa'ji.. if you
weren't here today..

1562
02:23:37,084 --> 02:23:38,665
There would have been someone else

1563
02:23:39,505 --> 02:23:43,008
The Lord up there runs a
regular courier service

1564
02:23:43,719 --> 02:23:47,382
He always provides for ones in need

1565
02:25:22,047 --> 02:25:24,669
Those two have fled the hospital
but they haven't fled Delhi yet

1566
02:25:27,341 --> 02:25:29,133
Seal Delhi, sir

1567
02:25:39,811 --> 02:25:43,894
Papa'ji, all that
you've done for us..

1568
02:25:44,024 --> 02:25:47,267
One honest man would do for another

1569
02:25:49,068 --> 02:25:50,819
Papa'ji, you're kidding me

1570
02:25:52,572 --> 02:25:56,865
By now you must have figured that
we aren't half as honest as we seem

1571
02:25:59,867 --> 02:26:04,030
I don't know what you've done to
make these people hunt you down..

1572
02:26:06,833 --> 02:26:11,247
but I see a simple
honesty in your eyes..

1573
02:26:13,088 --> 02:26:16,421
..take care son

1574
02:26:19,342 --> 02:26:26,299
God bless you.

1575
02:26:51,027 --> 02:26:53,950
For the next week or so
they'll be baying for our blood

1576
02:26:54,030 --> 02:27:00,325
We'll return afterwards.. but
where have you hidden the gold?

1577
02:27:01,285 --> 02:27:03,208
What's your baby, a boy or a girl?

1578
02:27:05,629 --> 02:27:07,001
What will you name your baby?

1579
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:14,176
Before you think of a name you
need to see the baby at least?

1580
02:27:15,757 --> 02:27:20,221
A day has gone by, have you
even taken one look at your baby?

1581
02:27:21,933 --> 02:27:27,187
Did you hold your child in
your arms, even once.. once even?

1582
02:27:34,902 --> 02:27:38,736
Vimmi, you know we didn't
have any time for these.

1583
02:27:40,567 --> 02:27:41,819
Had l stopped for all this..

1584
02:27:41,949 --> 02:27:44,910
all three of us would've
either been jailed or killed by now

1585
02:27:45,661 --> 02:27:47,113
Some reason for celebration!

1586
02:27:47,783 --> 02:27:51,535
The day he is born.. his parents die

1587
02:27:52,167 --> 02:27:56,169
Cursed fate to be born with!
- Not his fault, is it?

1588
02:27:56,329 --> 02:27:59,002
That's what I'm saying!
What wrong has he done..

1589
02:27:59,132 --> 02:28:03,215
to deserve parents who
can go to jail anytime..

1590
02:28:03,676 --> 02:28:05,337
leaving him to rot on the streets

1591
02:28:10,471 --> 02:28:13,473
What are you trying to say?
- Enough

1592
02:28:15,184 --> 02:28:18,307
I won't do this anymore.
Neither will you..

1593
02:28:22,021 --> 02:28:23,231
Then what else can we do?

1594
02:28:24,022 --> 02:28:28,235
Anything, whatever
everyone else does

1595
02:28:30,487 --> 02:28:32,859
If we had to end up doing
what everybody else does..

1596
02:28:32,949 --> 02:28:34,610
why did we ever run away from home?

1597
02:28:37,203 --> 02:28:38,613
Because we were wrong

1598
02:28:44,708 --> 02:28:48,751
Now we're not free
to live as we like.

1599
02:28:49,872 --> 02:28:52,755
Now we're
responsible for one more life

1600
02:28:53,425 --> 02:28:54,966
How's he going to grow up?

1601
02:28:55,426 --> 02:28:57,167
How? With us..

1602
02:28:57,219 --> 02:28:59,010
..that's how With us?

1603
02:28:59,430 --> 02:29:01,761
And which school will he go to

1604
02:29:02,593 --> 02:29:05,765
You know this world we live in
has two kinds of people. One..

1605
02:29:06,055 --> 02:29:09,768
who waste the best years of
their lives in schools and colleges.

1606
02:29:09,938 --> 02:29:12,481
And the kind who school themselves.

1607
02:29:13,021 --> 02:29:15,933
Like us. We taught us
to do what we're doing

1608
02:29:16,313 --> 02:29:18,275
Which is what he'll learn?
- Of course!

1609
02:29:18,565 --> 02:29:20,356
And then he'll go to jail someday?

1610
02:29:20,696 --> 02:29:22,399
Have we ever been to jail?

1611
02:29:23,149 --> 02:29:26,071
We very nearly got thrown into jail

1612
02:29:27,031 --> 02:29:32,155
I don't want my son
growing up behind bars..

1613
02:29:33,327 --> 02:29:35,328
or dying young on the run

1614
02:29:36,709 --> 02:29:42,203
Do you remember agreeing on
all our marriage vows except..

1615
02:29:42,665 --> 02:29:44,666
We'll be Bunty-Babli
for the rest of our lives

1616
02:29:44,796 --> 02:29:48,669
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except..

1617
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:53,053
Except?
- Leave that to me

1618
02:29:53,673 --> 02:29:54,674
Okay

1619
02:29:55,304 --> 02:29:57,265
This is the exception Rakesh

1620
02:29:58,097 --> 02:30:00,968
You're getting over-emotional
about this motherhood business

1621
02:30:04,892 --> 02:30:08,895
But now l am whatever l am.
Now I want to hear your decision

1622
02:30:09,566 --> 02:30:12,357
Choose. lt's either this life..
or a life together

1623
02:30:29,371 --> 02:30:30,792
So what have you decided?

1624
02:30:35,296 --> 02:30:37,127
What'll I do without the two of you?

1625
02:30:44,884 --> 02:30:46,885
Those marriage vows
weren't mere words

1626
02:30:51,679 --> 02:30:53,311
Fursatganj or Pankinagar?

1627
02:30:55,022 --> 02:30:56,513
Is it you that's saying this or?

1628
02:30:59,355 --> 02:31:00,646
Bunty and Rakesh. Both

1629
02:31:08,733 --> 02:31:10,484
What?
- Tickets

1630
02:31:14,617 --> 02:31:17,159
Since when are we buying tickets?
- From today

1631
02:31:18,871 --> 02:31:20,662
Why become so damn honest?

1632
02:31:30,130 --> 02:31:33,001
Oye Rakesh, you're in love

1633
02:31:35,214 --> 02:31:36,795
Oh all right

1634
02:31:39,717 --> 02:31:46,352
Rakesh my boy, this world we
live in has two kinds of men. One..

1635
02:31:46,392 --> 02:31:48,263
the kind that thinks
twice before getting married

1636
02:31:48,433 --> 02:31:51,476
And the kind that thinks
afterwards like you, you idiot

1637
02:31:54,609 --> 02:31:57,771
Two tickets for Fursatganj

1638
02:31:58,151 --> 02:31:59,363
Name?

1639
02:32:00,073 --> 02:32:01,774
Rakesh Trivedi, Vimmi Trivedi

1640
02:32:05,368 --> 02:32:06,949
Bunty and Babli

1641
02:32:09,621 --> 02:32:12,323
You've had a long run.
You must be tired

1642
02:32:44,059 --> 02:32:45,349
Rakesh.

1643
02:32:50,944 --> 02:32:52,275
Can we have some water?

1644
02:32:54,407 --> 02:32:55,567
Die of thirst dog!

1645
02:32:56,908 --> 02:32:58,609
Not for me. For the two of them

1646
02:33:22,338 --> 02:33:23,839
You won't believe me..

1647
02:33:24,761 --> 02:33:26,802
..but we quit being
crooks half an hour ago

1648
02:33:29,475 --> 02:33:31,096
Absolutely right, I
won't believe you.

1649
02:33:33,267 --> 02:33:35,019
- But if l insist
I'm telling the truth?

1650
02:33:35,149 --> 02:33:39,141
I'll start doing right now what I
had planned to do to you in jail

1651
02:33:41,814 --> 02:33:44,697
Why are you looking at me like
that? - He's telling the truth

1652
02:33:45,277 --> 02:33:48,989
Guaranteed by you,
India's biggest bonafide liar?

1653
02:33:50,201 --> 02:33:51,612
I'm not lying

1654
02:33:51,742 --> 02:33:55,075
A dog's tail insists it became
ramrod straight half an hour ago?

1655
02:33:55,245 --> 02:33:56,866
You're as old as my father..

1656
02:33:58,537 --> 02:34:00,749
..no one's had the cheek
to talk to her like that

1657
02:34:01,120 --> 02:34:04,371
So you respect your elders now,
do you? - And why shouldn't we?

1658
02:34:04,463 --> 02:34:07,004
Now don't tell me you pray
first thing every morning too!

1659
02:34:07,084 --> 02:34:08,465
She does

1660
02:34:08,715 --> 02:34:12,338
So?
- So what!

1661
02:34:13,179 --> 02:34:15,091
Now you pray to your
heart's content in jail!

1662
02:34:15,841 --> 02:34:19,303
It's all your fault now suffer.
- My fault?

1663
02:34:19,555 --> 02:34:22,977
Who's idea was it to go straight?
- It was for a good cause..

1664
02:34:23,097 --> 02:34:25,929
do you want your son to go to jail?
- So where's he going now?

1665
02:34:26,310 --> 02:34:32,774
Now I see how the two of you
have been fooling people for years

1666
02:34:36,648 --> 02:34:38,189
Pappu is hungry

1667
02:34:39,279 --> 02:34:42,492
Pappu? When did we
start calling him Pappu?

1668
02:34:42,742 --> 02:34:44,323
Got to call him something no?

1669
02:34:44,533 --> 02:34:47,196
You're thinking of
the gold all the time

1670
02:34:50,539 --> 02:34:56,003
Let's step outside for a while

1671
02:34:58,044 --> 02:35:00,297
I'm not going anywhere.
- Up

1672
02:35:03,469 --> 02:35:08,383
Darned luck. No one ever caught
us when we were in the thick of it

1673
02:35:09,673 --> 02:35:11,305
But the moment we quit..

1674
02:35:13,767 --> 02:35:16,429
Why did you get into all this?

1675
02:35:22,524 --> 02:35:24,395
I wanted to become
someone important.

1676
02:35:26,027 --> 02:35:27,398
And.. you became?

1677
02:35:29,529 --> 02:35:32,322
You won't understand.
- Why..

1678
02:35:33,863 --> 02:35:35,285
why won't I understand?

1679
02:35:36,575 --> 02:35:38,827
Because he never did.
- Who?

1680
02:35:40,579 --> 02:35:41,910
My father

1681
02:35:45,253 --> 02:35:46,743
He's just like you

1682
02:35:50,417 --> 02:35:52,748
You're trying to con me again

1683
02:36:00,635 --> 02:36:03,596
May l?
- A smoke? Sure..

1684
02:36:06,519 --> 02:36:07,600
Where are you going?

1685
02:36:08,811 --> 02:36:10,763
If she sees me smoking she'll scream

1686
02:36:16,067 --> 02:36:18,108
The child will stay with the mother

1687
02:36:27,576 --> 02:36:29,277
What's the use of crying now?

1688
02:36:31,199 --> 02:36:34,031
Should've considered this
beforehand. - What else to do?

1689
02:36:36,833 --> 02:36:39,875
Become a ticket collector and
collect ten rupee bribes all my life?

1690
02:36:49,593 --> 02:36:50,795
You can come in

1691
02:37:09,689 --> 02:37:11,941
We'll have to make a phone
call to your home or mine

1692
02:37:12,652 --> 02:37:15,313
We certainly can't take him with us.

1693
02:37:15,443 --> 02:37:17,315
No, it won't come to that

1694
02:37:17,736 --> 02:37:19,026
I'll figure something.

1695
02:37:19,116 --> 02:37:21,699
And con ourselves
out of this one too?

1696
02:37:21,829 --> 02:37:23,370
What else to do?

1697
02:37:25,201 --> 02:37:27,323
Take with me to jail..

1698
02:37:27,994 --> 02:37:29,705
..the very son for whose
sake I gave up everything?

1699
02:37:34,459 --> 02:37:36,001
What justice!

1700
02:37:38,092 --> 02:37:40,793
Jails are for reforming.

1701
02:37:41,135 --> 02:37:43,296
And here, three
people are being jailed

1702
02:37:43,386 --> 02:37:46,469
Two of whom have reformed and a
third who's completely innocent

1703
02:37:47,850 --> 02:37:50,971
Don't worry Vimmi.

1704
02:37:51,183 --> 02:37:54,014
I'll crack a plan.
- What plan Rakesh?

1705
02:37:54,354 --> 02:37:56,517
We've run out of plans

1706
02:38:03,022 --> 02:38:05,563
Vimmi do you have any
idea what jails are like?

1707
02:38:11,569 --> 02:38:13,610
How will you spend so
many years inside one?

1708
02:38:17,914 --> 02:38:23,618
Let's do something, l'll
take the blame for everything

1709
02:38:25,919 --> 02:38:29,252
Then you're free to go home
to Fursatganj with the baby

1710
02:38:32,465 --> 02:38:34,797
All you wanted was to become a model

1711
02:38:37,339 --> 02:38:39,300
I dragged you into this whole thing

1712
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:49,808
You can't even make a
cup of tea for yourself.

1713
02:38:50,519 --> 02:38:53,021
In jail.. how?
- I'll manage Vimmi..

1714
02:38:53,732 --> 02:38:56,695
..don't worry about me

1715
02:38:57,525 --> 02:39:01,107
Have you ever managed
to do anything alone?

1716
02:39:02,949 --> 02:39:08,073
In any case, Bunty is
nothing without Babli

1717
02:39:32,053 --> 02:39:33,343
Get up

1718
02:39:34,054 --> 02:39:35,345
Unlock yourselves..

1719
02:39:36,685 --> 02:39:38,057
I can't do it..

1720
02:39:39,728 --> 02:39:41,729
We're nearing the railway
signal on the outskirts of Delhi

1721
02:39:43,852 --> 02:39:45,683
The train halts
there for two minutes

1722
02:39:47,775 --> 02:39:49,566
The two of..

1723
02:39:50,196 --> 02:39:54,650
the three of you can get
off and go wherever you wish

1724
02:39:56,071 --> 02:39:58,784
No one recognises
Bunty and Babli except me

1725
02:40:01,745 --> 02:40:03,327
And no one ever will

1726
02:40:23,383 --> 02:40:26,345
Sir..
- Shut up. Not a word

1727
02:40:27,677 --> 02:40:29,558
Or l just might change my mind

1728
02:40:31,059 --> 02:40:32,391
Get going

1729
02:40:35,022 --> 02:40:38,775
That's enough

1730
02:41:02,585 --> 02:41:06,297
Whether it was my
life's biggest mistake..

1731
02:41:06,797 --> 02:41:08,919
..or their best con act,
I didn't know

1732
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:14,304
But policemen are human too,
believe it or not..

1733
02:41:15,674 --> 02:41:17,305
we wear those
uniforms only on our body,

1734
02:41:17,385 --> 02:41:19,928
..at heart we're as
vulnerable as babies

1735
02:41:22,641 --> 02:41:25,892
I believed I had
destroyed Bunty-Babli,

1736
02:41:26,683 --> 02:41:29,145
so l let Rakesh and Vimmi go..

1737
02:41:30,146 --> 02:41:37,693
because l think the law
needs to destroy crime, not lives

1738
02:41:39,153 --> 02:41:42,365
The bank's gold was recovered
from the spot Babli had indicated

1739
02:41:43,327 --> 02:41:47,529
The recoveries continued
for months afterwards..

1740
02:41:47,951 --> 02:41:54,085
monies and valuables
stolen by Bunty and Babli

1741
02:41:54,375 --> 02:41:57,787
I think they had told me
the truth about going back..

1742
02:41:58,089 --> 02:42:02,251
to live respectable,
honest lives like their parents

1743
02:42:10,468 --> 02:42:13,721
Rakesh'ji could you
perhaps increase the pressure

1744
02:42:18,685 --> 02:42:20,356
What a joy

1745
02:42:23,819 --> 02:42:28,193
This world we live in has
two kinds of Pappus. One..

1746
02:42:28,573 --> 02:42:31,024
the kind who obey their
parents and get to eat chocolates

1747
02:42:31,575 --> 02:42:35,868
and the kind that doesn't and
gets locked up inside toilets

1748
02:42:35,948 --> 02:42:37,869
You are?
- The first

1749
02:42:38,831 --> 02:42:40,822
My darling baby

1750
02:42:42,123 --> 02:42:43,785
But he didn't even drink his milk.

1751
02:42:44,625 --> 02:42:45,956
He'll eat the chocolate

1752
02:42:46,587 --> 02:42:49,709
What good are chocolates?
You and your fads

1753
02:42:49,960 --> 02:42:54,043
No, I'm feeling cold..
- Forget the cold. Be fashionable

1754
02:43:00,258 --> 02:43:01,799
What are you teaching Pappu?

1755
02:43:01,889 --> 02:43:07,303
To speak the truth
and pray every morning

1756
02:43:07,393 --> 02:43:10,556
Where's my son? One of his
friends is waiting downstairs

1757
02:43:12,017 --> 02:43:15,600
Friends and folks in
Fursatganj find all the time for fun

1758
02:43:15,730 --> 02:43:19,193
You fix the name of this city.
I'll fix this friend

1759
02:43:23,365 --> 02:43:26,608
My son is genius from..

1760
02:43:27,529 --> 02:43:29,161
childhood

1761
02:43:29,871 --> 02:43:31,112
I am very lucky

1762
02:43:31,662 --> 02:43:34,665
I got a daughter-in-law
who is very very smart

1763
02:43:35,956 --> 02:43:39,919
It's such a joy to know
that our son and his wife..

1764
02:43:39,959 --> 02:43:41,540
..have done things..

1765
02:43:41,630 --> 02:43:44,623
so important that your
department still remembers them

1766
02:43:46,674 --> 02:43:52,299
Never told folks at home
what all you achieved?

1767
02:43:53,549 --> 02:43:56,182
Maybe you should tell us

1768
02:43:58,805 --> 02:44:00,596
Nervous already?

1769
02:44:02,937 --> 02:44:04,519
A scam is in the offing

1770
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:08,521
Huge scam

1771
02:44:11,484 --> 02:44:12,695
Sir..

1772
02:44:14,607 --> 02:44:18,901
I swear by my son, l've given it up

1773
02:44:20,451 --> 02:44:22,953
I've no idea of what
scams are happening

1774
02:44:24,205 --> 02:44:27,036
For three years now, I'm
following a work-home-work routine

1775
02:44:27,116 --> 02:44:30,499
This scam has got to be stopped.
- Then go ahead and stop it

1776
02:44:36,834 --> 02:44:38,255
We cannot stop it

1777
02:44:39,547 --> 02:44:40,968
Who else can?

1778
02:44:44,931 --> 02:44:46,172
You

1779
02:44:51,306 --> 02:44:55,389
Please save us from this life of
honesty and respectfulness. Please.

1780
02:44:55,519 --> 02:44:57,771
Is it just you, or..
- Both of us.

1781
02:44:59,813 --> 02:45:04,737
I'd choose death over
making mango pickle.

1782
02:45:05,107 --> 02:45:06,988
I'd rather die, Rakesh.

1783
02:45:26,214 --> 02:45:29,707
Have faith in God. Faith prevails.

1784
02:45:31,168 --> 02:45:33,379
One step, two steps,
he steps it up, swings it

1785
02:45:33,509 --> 02:45:35,881
pumps it, struts his stuff.
Meet Bunty.

1786
02:45:38,763 --> 02:45:40,965
Minute by minute,
she turns it up, spins it

1787
02:45:41,055 --> 02:45:43,557
so you can't get enough. Meet Babli.

1788
02:45:49,983 --> 02:45:53,315
Swami.. Bunty Ramaswami.

1789
02:45:53,395 --> 02:45:56,568
Mandalam.. Babli Cholamandalam.

1790
02:45:57,238 --> 02:46:00,901
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli

1791
02:46:00,991 --> 02:46:02,322
They maybe two,
but they're too much.

1792
02:46:02,402 --> 02:46:05,535
Once upon a time he told me that
he was in the business of cleaning

1793
02:46:05,615 --> 02:46:08,407
So l put them on the job
of cleaning up society

1794
02:46:08,617 --> 02:46:12,040
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli

1795
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:16,954
They maybe two,
but they're too much.
