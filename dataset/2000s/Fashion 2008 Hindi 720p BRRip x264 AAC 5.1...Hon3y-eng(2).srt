1
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,906
<i>"Let me go home, beloved.
Let me go home. "</i>

2
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>"Let me go home, beloved.
Let me go home. "</i>

3
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,448
Dreams are sold differently
in different cities.

4
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,906
Because the city and it's monotonous
life needs the vision and color...

5
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,906
... of a beautiful dream to make itself big.

6
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,906
A city like this, where a dream of...

7
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,323
... becoming an international super model...

8
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,323
I, Meghna Mathur dreamt and lived.

9
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:26,906
The only difference was that
my dream was bigger than the city.

10
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,573
Since you were tired of eating
the potato pancakes for breakfast...

11
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,906
... so I made radish pancakes today.

12
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,490
- Mother, this has a lot of butter.
- Have it.

13
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,906
I told you I am on a diet.

14
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:40,240
Having one won't make a difference.

15
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,240
Of course, it will.
I am trying to lose two kilos.

16
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:47,240
I got my portfolio done.

17
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:54,323
I was thinking of leaving
for Mumbai on Monday.

18
00:04:56,198 --> 00:05:00,573
Monday reminds me, I have
spoken to Mehra Associates.

19
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:03,906
They have agreed on an
internship with them...

20
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,198
... while you finish your chartered
accountants course.

21
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,573
In fact, you can start with
them from Monday.

22
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:09,449
Papa, you didn't hear me.

23
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,115
I want to go to Mumbai...

24
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:15,240
to become a model.

25
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,906
I don't want to do an internship.

26
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:25,115
Meghna, I've told you earlier also.

27
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:27,990
Never mind.

28
00:05:28,323 --> 00:05:31,532
Listen, dreaming isn't bad but...

29
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:32,656
But what father?

30
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,198
Fulfill only your dreams?

31
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:39,240
Can't I have my own dream?

32
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:43,532
I have decided...

33
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,115
I am going to Mumbai.

34
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:51,990
In that case there is
nothing left to discuss.

35
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,115
Do as you wish...

36
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,531
... but don't expect anything from me.

37
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,115
A little encouragement perhaps...

38
00:05:58,198 --> 00:05:59,906
Encouragement for what?

39
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,656
You have lost your mind after
winning a small beauty pageant.

40
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,573
It was my fault.

41
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:20,906
Wants to be a model!

42
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:33,906
Though I have spoken to
your uncle Baldev...

43
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,240
... call me as soon as you reach.

44
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,324
Father...

45
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,990
Don't worry.
Everything will be alright

46
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:52,449
Love you...

47
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:59,198
You were much younger during
cousin Kuldeep's wedding.

48
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:03,656
Divya is very happy ever since
she learnt you were coming.

49
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:04,990
Sister...

50
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,990
Mother was mentioning
that you want to model.

51
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:11,948
It will be great to watch
her on television.

52
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:13,073
Divya...

53
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:17,407
Come Meghna, I will show
you to your room.

54
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:19,948
Of course and be comfortable.

55
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,073
Thank you.

56
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,906
This is Divya's room...

57
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,449
You will have to share it with her.

58
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,573
Sure.

59
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,989
It's a little small...

60
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,948
... but you won't be here for long.

61
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,989
Maybe a month, until I get work.

62
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:39,573
Alright, freshen up,
till then I will serve breakfast.

63
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:40,948
Thank you.

64
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:06,115
Okay, not today. Alright,
I'll talk to you later.

65
00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:09,449
- Hi.
- Hello gorgeous, welcome to Mumbai.

66
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,907
No, no, darling.
Lesson number one...

67
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,948
... never kiss the cheeks, okay?

68
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,240
Sit.

69
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:22,656
I'm sorry I'm late
but what could I do.

70
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:24,656
Vinay wouldn't let me go.

71
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:27,656
Now before you jump into any conclusions,
Vinay Khosla is my boss.

72
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:29,531
You know the famous
Bollywood designer.

73
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:31,656
This evening we have to
do fittings for Duggu...

74
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,989
- You know last minute changes.
- Duggu?

75
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,199
Duggu... Hrithik.

76
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:40,489
Anyway, enough of blabbering.
You tell me how you are.

77
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:41,656
I'm okay.

78
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:44,656
When I saw you in that silly
beauty contest in Chandigarh...

79
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:47,199
I just knew that you
are going to be a star.

80
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:48,989
Thank you, Rohit.

81
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:51,073
I'm here because you
showed confidence in me.

82
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,115
Now everything is in your hands.

83
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,656
Don't worry, darling.
I am your man.

84
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:57,282
- Do you have your pictures?
- Yes, of course!

85
00:08:57,947 --> 00:08:59,282
Okay, let me have a look.

86
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,115
What's the matter?

87
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:13,947
Nothing. Nothing. Fine.
Interesting, I'll handle it, okay?

88
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:16,989
Who are you looking for?

89
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,324
Your casting agent.

90
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,448
Here?

91
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:26,407
Shomu, hot shot co-ordinator,
a Godmother to the newcomers.

92
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:28,989
Don't be too fussy.

93
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,947
Have you ever travelled by
plane before?

94
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:32,947
I'm sending you to a foreign location.

95
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,324
So what if the role is small?

96
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:35,947
You will suffer one day.

97
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:38,615
And Shweta, you have a two dayjob.

98
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:42,073
No one gives more than 25,000 rupees
for a Punjabi dance number.

99
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:45,615
I would have done it,
if I were taller.

100
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:47,282
Ma'am, you are being called inside.

101
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:48,989
Who is it?

102
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,324
Are you new?

103
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,073
- Are you from the north?
- Yes.

104
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:00,615
What size are you?

105
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,157
Small, medium, large?

106
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:05,448
Listen, I am not interested.

107
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:08,531
It's the client who wants to know.

108
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:11,947
I wasjust about to call you.

109
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:14,531
I'm sending a girl for the catalogue.
Check her out.

110
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,656
What? What is your name?

111
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,656
Meghna... Meghna Mathur.

112
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,531
Her name is Meghna Mathur.

113
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,282
Bye.

114
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:23,947
Okay, listen, You have
an audition tomorrow.

115
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,947
B 409, Adarsh Nagar.
Be there at eleven o'clock.

116
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:28,073
Take the number from this chick.

117
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:29,199
Chick?

118
00:10:29,282 --> 00:10:30,324
An audition? Tomorrow?

119
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:31,947
Yes, and listen if it works...

120
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,615
... I take a twenty per cent cut.
Is that clear?

121
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:35,947
Okay.

122
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:41,947
Stop here, I think this is the place.

123
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,989
How much is it?

124
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,324
Fifteen rupees.

125
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,282
Take this.

126
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,365
I recently did two advertisements.

127
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,531
What about you?

128
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,490
I'm an airhostess.

129
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:08,947
I got bored of serving people...

130
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:11,282
... so now I want to be a model.

131
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,656
Do you have a problem with that?

132
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,365
- No.
- Then stop bothering me.

133
00:11:15,406 --> 00:11:16,947
It is a soap commercial, isn't it?

134
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,074
Alright, I will be there.

135
00:11:18,615 --> 00:11:19,947
I am at Adarsh Nagar right now.

136
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:21,615
I will be at Famous studios in an hour.

137
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,199
Okay, pal, I'll be there, bye.

138
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:32,947
New?

139
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:35,199
Yes.

140
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:36,656
Auditioning for the first time?

141
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,199
How did you guess?

142
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,490
Only novices walk around
with their portfolio.

143
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:47,282
Seasoned models, like us,
send it in earlier or email it to them.

144
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:54,490
- By the way, I'm Manav... Manav Bhasin.
- Hello.

145
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:56,406
A veteran struggler.
Since nine months.

146
00:11:58,074 --> 00:11:59,947
- And you?
- Who is Meghna Mathur?

147
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:01,074
That's me.

148
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,573
- Please, come in.
- Yes.

149
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:04,947
- All the best.
- Thank you.

150
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:07,032
Saira Khan...
give me your left profile...

151
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:08,615
Right profile...

152
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,282
Hi, I am Saira Khan. Age 22...

153
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,490
You can contact me on 98...

154
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:17,947
Hi... my name is Meghna Mathur.

155
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:22,406
My mobile number is 9820131139.

156
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,074
Have patience, darling.

157
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:26,947
You can't be tired in
just three orfour auditions.

158
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:28,947
It takes up to three
hundred auditions at times...

159
00:12:29,032 --> 00:12:30,365
to finally get a break

160
00:12:31,157 --> 00:12:34,157
Nowjust relax, okay?
Have your coffee. It's not easy, dear.

161
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,282
Okay. I'll call you later.

162
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:36,406
One week is over...

163
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,199
Will you do a lingerie advertisement?

164
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,365
Shomu...

165
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:43,615
I have told you a million times,
It's lingerie not lin-guh-ree.

166
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:44,947
The same thing.

167
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:46,074
Will you do it?

168
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:47,948
Shomu, just behave yourself,
okay? Meghna is a star.

169
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:50,406
Meghna won't do such
degrading commercials.

170
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,032
Why are you getting angry?

171
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:53,948
What is so degrading in
a lingerie advertisement?

172
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,698
Haven't you seen commercially
successful models in calendars?

173
00:12:55,948 --> 00:12:57,032
They wear whatever they are told.

174
00:12:57,074 --> 00:12:59,490
Attitude walks in before stardom.

175
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:01,698
And you go to Bandra.
I'll give you an address.

176
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,157
Don't take her seriously.

177
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,157
She just talks nonsense sometimes, okay?

178
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:11,032
Look, just relax, darling.
I've got a surprise for you.

179
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:13,573
- We are going for a fashion show tomorrow.
- Fashion Show?

180
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:16,948
That too Rahul Arora's fashion show.

181
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:20,406
Rahul Arora! I have only
seen him on television.

182
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,365
So tomorrow evening it is
Rahul Arora's fashion show. Live!

183
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:26,948
Love, I have told you so many times
not to keep your phone switched off.

184
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:29,282
Because I get worried.

185
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,406
You know, you are becoming
impossible now.

186
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:35,032
Not the same thing again!

187
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:37,074
I am not being possessive.

188
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,948
I should at least know where you are...

189
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:41,241
... and what you're up to.

190
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,365
That's nonsense and
you know it is not true.

191
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:47,948
We've been together
since six months...

192
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,573
... and I know you quite well.

193
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:53,573
No, I don't want to discuss it?

194
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:55,948
Now what?

195
00:13:57,948 --> 00:13:59,032
Behave...

196
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,948
Come on, Rahul, just once.

197
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:05,948
- No...
- Please baby, say it. Please, darling.

198
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,157
- Not right now.
- Please, darling. Please say it, once.

199
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,365
- Try to understand.
- Darling, please.

200
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,490
Okay, I am hanging up the phone.

201
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:15,948
- One minute. We are meeting tonight, aren't we? - Yes.

202
00:14:16,032 --> 00:14:19,948
- I'll see you soon. Okay? Okay. Bye.
- Rahul...

203
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,074
Yes mother...

204
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,615
What can I say?

205
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,948
The whole world is talking.

206
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,948
Everyone is laughing at me.

207
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:33,241
They say I don't want
you to get married.

208
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,281
Let them talk.
How does it affect us?

209
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:36,948
How can I bear it?

210
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:38,948
We can't go against society.

211
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:40,490
It's high time you got married.

212
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,615
Your uncle Kishen from
London had called.

213
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:45,615
He sent some pictures through email.

214
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,948
Mom! I don't want to see
any pictures of girls.

215
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,448
- At least look at them.
- Mom, please...

216
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,448
At least don't bother me today.

217
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,615
Tomorrow is my show
and I'm really nervous.

218
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:05,573
<i>"I know baby that you need me. "</i>

219
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,281
Oh Jassi, what are you doing?

220
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:10,948
Look straight. Yes.

221
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,032
That's good.

222
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,281
And turn.

223
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:19,365
Make a note. Third sequence.
Dinaz is first.

224
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:22,657
Girls, walk faster,
this isn't a garden.

225
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:24,948
Couturier, lets see it.

226
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:28,157
Now listen quickly get ready for it.
We don't have much time.

227
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:29,698
And please, concentrate.

228
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:31,157
Couturier, what is this?

229
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:33,241
This is the show stopper outfit.

230
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:34,365
Increase the length of the slit.

231
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,490
There are only three hours
left for the show.

232
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:38,157
Please leave.
Don't stress me out.

233
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:39,657
Please, quickly.

234
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,989
Rahul, pay attention now okay?
We have a run through, alright?

235
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:44,365
Yes, but where is Shonali?

236
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:46,573
When is she ever punctual
that today will be an exception?

237
00:15:46,657 --> 00:15:50,116
She is your show stopper
and your favourite.

238
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,365
Why aren't we sitting in the front row?
It's absolutely empty.

239
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,948
Are you nuts?
That's reserved seating, darling.

240
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,573
Just watch what happens
there in a while.

241
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,989
Hi... come on, Jack.

242
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,365
Sir... sir... this is reserved, sir.

243
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:12,948
Are you mad? Listen,
this is not the first row like this.

244
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:14,448
I am leaving, okay?

245
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,989
- You know where?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,365
Now come on, speak to Rahul
and arrange for it fast.

247
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:20,240
Okay, sir. Give me two minutes.
I'll arrange it.

248
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:21,989
Hello, J. P, I have a situation out here.

249
00:16:22,323 --> 00:16:23,365
Relax, dude.

250
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,448
Sweetie, this is my number, call me.

251
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:38,573
Hi.

252
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:44,490
- Meghna...
- Yes?

253
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:45,615
Look there.

254
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:49,573
There in the front row,
that's my boss Vinay Khosla.

255
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:51,948
He is Rahul's biggest rival...

256
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,989
... and his most loyal audience.

257
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:56,116
He doesn't miss a single show.

258
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,365
That guy?

259
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:00,948
- Don't you point!
- I am sorry. - This is cheap.

260
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:04,573
There, right hand corner...

261
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:09,116
That's Ashish Suri...
Rahul's boyfriend.

262
00:17:09,989 --> 00:17:11,032
He is so cute, isn't he?

263
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,032
I hate Rahul.

264
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:17,116
Look, front row center.
That's the fashion power list.

265
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:20,532
She is Shelly Duggal, the editor
of a famous fashion magazine.

266
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:25,989
Sitting to her left, there... can you
see the lady in the animal print?

267
00:17:26,989 --> 00:17:29,989
Anisha Roy, the owner
of Profiles Agency.

268
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:33,989
Every top model since the past
six years is from their agency.

269
00:17:35,657 --> 00:17:38,573
Oh, here come
Mr. and Mrs. Abhijeet Sarin.

270
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:40,989
She is a hi-flying socialite, but he...

271
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:44,157
he is the big daddy of the fashion world.

272
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:45,989
The owner of Panache.

273
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,657
His brand is the biggest
status symbol in the fashion world.

274
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,698
Everyone dances to
his tunes. Everyone.

275
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:57,157
Ladies and gentlemen,
can you take your seats?

276
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,198
The show is about to begin.

277
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,990
<i>"Charm. Charm. "</i>

278
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,573
<i>"Charm. "</i>

279
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:11,323
<i>"C'mon, sing with me!"</i>

280
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,365
- Look my dear.
- Shonali Gulral.

281
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,448
That's right. The Diva.

282
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,323
<i>"Charm. "</i>

283
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:22,198
<i>"The charm is of the body. "</i>

284
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,990
<i>"The charm is of the body. "</i>

285
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,698
<i>"This charm is famous. "</i>

286
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,448
<i>"This charm is also a goal. "</i>

287
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,573
<i>"Get lucky here. "</i>

288
00:18:37,198 --> 00:18:38,240

<i>"Charm. Charm. "</i>

291
00:18:54,074 --> 00:18:55,116
You idiot!

292
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:56,365
I'm in the middle of the show...

293
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:58,532
I told you not to call me.

294
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:02,698
That was Mohsin, isn't it?

295
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,990
God knows how many times
you'll break up and patch up.

296
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:09,656
- Shonali, your next change.
- Yes, I know that.

297
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,323
<i>"The fire in you. "</i>

298
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:16,116
That's Jassi, isn't she?

299
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:19,532
<i>"She walks in style. "</i>

300
00:19:21,407 --> 00:19:26,574
<i>"It lights up fire in love. "</i>

301
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:28,240
<i>"Charm. Charm. "</i>

302
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:29,574
<i>"It's the charm...</i>

303
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,198

00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,574
<i>"It's the charm of fashion. "</i>

306
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,990
<i>"It's the charm of fashion. "</i>

307
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:48,198
<i>"This Charm. " "One's sake."
- Go. Go.</i>

308
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:09,448
<i>"Guess what?"</i>

309
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:20,407
<i>"Charm. Charm. "</i>

<i>"Charm. Charm. "</i>

315
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:39,323
Start dimming the lights.
Now ask them to stand back.

316
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,739
<i>"It's the charm of fashion. "</i>

317
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,448
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands
together for Rahul Arora!

318
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,074
"Charm. Charm."

<i>"It's the charm of fashion. "</i>

323
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:29,990
I would like to thank Mr. Abhijeet Sarin...

324
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:33,032
... and Panache India for showing
so much of confidence in me.

325
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:34,240
And I look forward to this.

326
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,073
What about your next collection?

327
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,614
Well, you will have to wait forthis.

328
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:42,407
Spoke to Manish, you're on
for the Delhi show. Okay?

329
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:44,573
- Hi, Christine. Hi.
- Hi.

330
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:47,614
- The show was fantastic.
- Yes.

331
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:49,656
- We just loved the music.
- Thank you.

332
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:53,407
- Christine, this is Meghna.
- Hi. - Hi.

333
00:21:53,532 --> 00:21:54,656
She is here to be a model.

334
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:57,073
- Isn't she gorgeous?
- Yes, sure.

335
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:59,449
You know, you really must use her.

336
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:01,198
She'll dazzle the ramp.

337
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:02,323
Okay, send me your pictures.

338
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,532
- No. No. It's okay.
- So cute... do it.

339
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,282
Excuse me, girls. Hi.

340
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:08,740
- Hi, lmmi...
- Hi.

341
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,532
- You are looking great.
- Yes.

342
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:12,407
Can I show you my photographs?

343
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:13,740
I have them here with me.

344
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:21,740
- Here.
- Bye.

345
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:23,115
- Okay.
- Okay.

346
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,282
Excuse me.

347
00:22:27,656 --> 00:22:31,032
I agree you may not like the pictures
but you needn't throw them.

348
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:34,032
Attitude! Doesn't come
through in your photographs.

349
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,532
You need a good
photographer, baby.

350
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:39,532
Who would you go to
if you were in my place?

351
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:42,032
Darling, I'd never be in your place!

352
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:47,033
Kartik Suri, he's your man.

353
00:22:50,656 --> 00:22:53,198
You know Rohit, Kartik is
very busy these days.

354
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:56,740
Traveling, international
photo shoots, you know it.

355
00:22:57,115 --> 00:23:01,032
Okay, Come on, Sonu, look at her.
She is a star, you know it.

356
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,073
What difference will
one photo shoot make?

357
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,282
I'm sure if you put in
a word he will agree.

358
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,198
Look, please.

359
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:12,032
He charges 50,000 rupees,
along with make up and styling.

360
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,490
And separate charges for costumes.

361
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:15,282
Can she afford it?

362
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,115
Of course.

363
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,282
But Meghna...

364
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:22,073
- Wait.
- Well then, 10,000 rupees advance.

365
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,115
Will 7,000 rupees do for now?

366
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:25,614
I only have that much
with me right now.

367
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,198
But how did you...

368
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,990
I'm making an appointment for...

369
00:23:31,073 --> 00:23:33,614
... the 20th of next month
at eight in the morning.

370
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:36,740
If you cancel you forfeit
the advance. Okay?

371
00:23:37,614 --> 00:23:38,990
- Yes. That's fine.
- Actually...

372
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:41,032
- Okay.
- Seven... here is the advance.

373
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,032
Manav, I told you earlier as well...

374
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:48,032
... if you want to progress in this industry...

375
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:50,531
... you have to compromise.

376
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:54,990
Come on, do you think
that all the successful models...

377
00:23:55,073 --> 00:23:57,407
... found workjust like that?

378
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:01,073
They also had to compromise.

379
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:06,198
I can't do what others do.

380
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,282
I want to be successful
on my own terms.

381
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,073
Not like this.

382
00:24:12,573 --> 00:24:15,032
Well, suit yourself.

383
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:21,032
Anyway, thank you for your time.
Have a good day.

384
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,615
Hi Amar, where are you?

385
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,240
Hi, Mrs. Agarwal...

386
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:32,032
Rohit here, from
Vinay Khosla's office, ma'am.

387
00:24:32,365 --> 00:24:34,615
Ma'am, I'm here with
the outfits for the trial.

388
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,656
- Yes, that's right.
- Manav!

389
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:39,032
- Yes. Oh hi.
- Ma'am...

390
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:41,615
- Hi, how are you? Good.
- Good, how are you?

391
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,032
What are you doing here?
Did you have a meeting?

392
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,698
- At lunch, ma'am?
- Yes, a kind of... - I didn't do it till now.

393
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:49,740
That's what I came here for,
but it didn't work out.

394
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,198
- Anyway. - I'll see you after lunch.
- I'll see you later.

395
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:55,198
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

396
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:03,032
- Who is that?
- Just a friend... model.

397
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,615
You should have at least
introduced me to him.

398
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:08,324
- He's quite hot.
- Rohit.

399
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,032
- Now what?
- Lunch.

400
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:18,032
Enjoy, Meghna.
I only have mineral water.

401
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:21,365
Especially when someone
else is paying the bill.

402
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:25,407
But how can we eat out here,
it's so expensive.

403
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:26,615
Just relax, okay?

404
00:25:27,073 --> 00:25:30,282
Mrs. Agarwal is an NRI.
She is very rich.

405
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:35,073
She told me to have lunch
and add the bill to her account.

406
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,615
- Shomu called today. Yes.
- What?

407
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,032
She said there is
a party at some hotel.

408
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:44,740
If I have to make contacts,
I must go.

409
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:46,199
Should I go?

410
00:25:46,282 --> 00:25:48,073
Of course, you should go Meghna!

411
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,073
Networking is very important.

412
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,240
What fun!

413
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:55,740
Lunch and dinner both
at a five star hotel.

414
00:25:56,032 --> 00:25:57,073
You are on a roll.

415
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,282
<i>"Hey baby!"</i>

416
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:10,489
Sorry. Hi, Janet here.

417
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,656
Stop fooling around.

418
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,407
The girls have been waiting in
the lobby since long.

419
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:17,032
Listen, there are three girls...

420
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:19,282
... one of them is new.

421
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:22,073
Just explain it to them.
Properly, okay?

422
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,740
Yes, I'll be there in five minutes.

423
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:28,032
Sorry, Sameer, I have to go.

424
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:31,073
Working, you know.
Love doesn't provide food.

425
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,282
Sameer?

426
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:35,573
Not Sameer, honey, Sohail.

427
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:40,073
Oh, it's my fault. Sorry. Bye.

428
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:42,531
- Stay together, okay?
- Okay.

429
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:44,490
Where is Bajaj?

430
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:45,740
- Hello Janet!
- Hello!

431
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:47,531
Welcome to the party,
how are you?

432
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:49,032
- Very well. How are you doing?
- Come. Come.

433
00:26:49,115 --> 00:26:51,073
- Come. Come.
- Let me introduce you to my friends.

434
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:55,240
- Sir... Janet, meet Mr...
- Hi.

435
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,781
A young businessman from Oman.

436
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,407
- Hi.
- And sir, meet Ms. Janet.

437
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,615
She is a very well-known
model from Mumbai.

438
00:27:00,698 --> 00:27:02,032
- Hi... very nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

439
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:03,240
Nice meeting you.

440
00:27:03,448 --> 00:27:06,406
- Meet my friends, Shaheen.
- Hi. - The music video queen.

441
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:08,490
The 'Kanta laga' type.

442
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:11,573
- She is Meghna.
- Hello.

443
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:15,115
The famous super hit
Bollywood item girl.

444
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:20,073
- She is Anita, the famous calendar girl.
- Hello.

445
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,240
Hi!

446
00:27:35,282 --> 00:27:38,324
One vodka with coconut
water on it. Vodka?

447
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,406
No thank you, I don't drink.

448
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:45,615
Drink up. It's free and imported too.

449
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:51,240
Shomu said that I could
make some contacts here.

450
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,615
- Drink ma'am.
- Contacts? And that too here?

451
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:59,782
Just smile and look pretty
for the photographs.

452
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:03,157
And then ourjob is done.
That's it!

453
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:07,240
- Thank you. - Janet!
- Yes Bajaj, coming.

454
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:17,448
Good party, isn't it?
Mukesh Tyagi.

455
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:22,282
I run an ad agency.
Talent Unlimited and you?

456
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:24,074
Meghna Mathur...

457
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,782
You are a model, right?

458
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,698
No, not as yet but hopefully...

459
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:31,282
Come on, you look professional.

460
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,032
Send me some of your photographs.

461
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:36,448
I suggest that you
drop in to my office.

462
00:28:36,573 --> 00:28:39,074
I have good contacts...
perhaps I can help you.

463
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:42,032
- Sure...
- Do one thing, this is my card and...

464
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:46,074
- call me up on my mobile.
- Okay?

465
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,448
Janet, Meet Mr...

466
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:50,782
Mukesh Tyagi.
He runs an ad agency. Yes.

467
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:52,115
Talent Unlimited.

468
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:54,074
<i>"Send me your pictures. "</i>

469
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,199
<i>Or "drop into my office. "</i>

470
00:28:56,406 --> 00:28:57,740
He says he has a lot of contacts.

471
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:00,656
He has been doing the party
rounds since the past five years.

472
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,074
Listen, fraud...

473
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:07,282
- ... with those old lines, you won't
catch any fish. - Go from here.

474
00:29:10,406 --> 00:29:12,573
What's the problem with
you small town girls?

475
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,573
Anyone who speaks halfway decent English,
can get anywhere with you.

476
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:18,115
Come on, let's go.

477
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:19,448
You want to make contacts.

478
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:24,740
Janet, Reema, Meghna.

479
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:30,199
Dolly, that's your 15,000.
I've cut five for the advance.

480
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:31,782
- There are 10,000 in the packet.
- Okay, fine.

481
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,115
And here's your 18,000.

482
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,324
Don't ask for conveyance.

483
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:36,782
We've got a party like this
after a month. Get it.

484
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:40,782
And Meghna...

485
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:43,115
It's yourfirst time so
I'm paying you 12,000.

486
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:46,782
What are you looking at?
Here take it.

487
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:48,157
Don't want it?

488
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:51,282
No... but... money?

489
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,240
You're paid for the work you did.

490
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:56,615
Work?

491
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:58,782
Didn't you pose for the camera?

492
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:02,157
People like having girls
at such parties.

493
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:05,240
Mr. Bajaj is an event manager...

494
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:07,157
... he contacts me for the models.

495
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,032
It's like this...

496
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:12,074
... pretty girls increase the glamour
quotient for such parties.

497
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,657
High society calls this
eye candy, understood?

498
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:15,782
Here take this.

499
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:17,115
Here.

500
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:20,074
And here, Reema.

501
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:22,323
- What's this? Where have you been?
- What do I do?

502
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,074
Don't you want your money?
What should I do?

503
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,032
The world of glamour is strange...

504
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:32,032
... you are so desperate
to achieve success...

505
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:36,698
... that the difference between
what's right and wrong begins to blur.

506
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:39,448
To be honest, there's barely
any time to think about it.

507
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:46,032
As the date for the portfolio got closer...

508
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:49,074
... my hopes began to diminish.

509
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:54,241
Meghna darling,
why are you so tense?

510
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:56,448
Everything will work out,
dear. I promise.

511
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:57,657
How is it possible, Rohit?

512
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:59,032
Only six days to go for the portfolio...

513
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:01,157
... and I still don't have the money.

514
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:02,782
You know what he said...

515
00:31:03,573 --> 00:31:05,032
If I don't pay the entire amount...

516
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,157
... then I forfeit the advance.

517
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,074
And I still have 30,000 to go.

518
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:11,365
Meghna, if you don't mind...

519
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:13,448
Shomu's offer is still open.

520
00:31:14,032 --> 00:31:15,115
I don't know.

521
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:16,448
You could give it a try.

522
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:18,074
It's worth a shot.

523
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:21,157
Lingerie?

524
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:26,157
<i>"Beautiful lady. "</i>

525
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:29,573
<i>"Drive me crazy. "</i>

526
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:35,074
<i>"Beautiful lady. "</i>

527
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,323
Janet, show some more skin.

528
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,698
I've shown enough for
what I've been paid. Get it?

529
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:41,074
Fine, let's get on with it.

530
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,281
<i>"Come on. "</i>

531
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,365
<i>"Beautiful lady. "</i>

532
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,573
<i>"You drive me crazy. "</i>

533
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:53,532
<i>"You drive me crazy. "</i>

534
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:56,657
Don't feel shy.

535
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,032
It's weird for the first ten seconds...

536
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:01,365
... after that, you will get used to it.

537
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,157
Come on madam.
Take off your gown.

538
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,448
There are other models
waiting for the shoot.

539
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:18,781
Quickly, there are three more to go.

540
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,323
Come on madam, make it quick.

541
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,573
Just feel free, do not stress.

542
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:50,615
- Take this.
- Meghna, relax.

543
00:32:50,698 --> 00:32:52,157
Archana... very good.

544
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:55,116
- Have some tea, you will feel better.
- No.

545
00:32:57,615 --> 00:32:58,698
Okay, left profile now.

546
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:01,781
- Janet, your cheque.
- Thank you.

547
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,365
Meghna, that's yours. You remember
my commission, right?

548
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:06,032
Yes, but Shomu are you sure this...

549
00:33:06,116 --> 00:33:09,074
... advertisement won't be released here?

550
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,739
I told you that it won't get released here.

551
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,448
This advertisement is only for Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh. Is that clear?

552
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:18,199
Don't worry.

553
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:19,739
You've done the advertisement now, so...

554
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,448
- Now chin up.
- Just have a smoke and chill.

555
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:26,448
Thanks. I don't smoke.

556
00:33:29,657 --> 00:33:31,573
Meghna, don't think so much.

557
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:35,199
The lesser you think,
the more you will make.

558
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,490
Thanks Janet.

559
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Oh yes. Tomorrow is
your portfolio shoot, isn't it?

560
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:50,199
- Yes. Thanks.
- All the best. I know you'll rock.

561
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:52,074
Okay guys, let's get this done.

562
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:58,074
Alright... just look up a bit.
Relax, yes. Okay.

563
00:33:58,116 --> 00:33:59,281
Now look at me. Smile.

564
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:01,240
Yes, nice. That's good.

565
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,407
Look at me and chin down.
Chin down.

566
00:34:03,448 --> 00:34:07,448
- Chin down.
- Chin slightly down. Relax now.

567
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:09,240
- Okay. Do it again!
- Sorry.

568
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,074
Smile... yes. Much better.

569
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,281
Okay, great.

570
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,781
Look at me. That's a nice smile.
Hold that.

571
00:34:16,074 --> 00:34:17,116
Hold that pose.

572
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:18,407
Superb!

573
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:23,074
Anisha, didn't I mention that...

574
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:26,157
I haven't seen a striking
impressive face recently.

575
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:29,532
And I finally found one.
She is unbelievable.

576
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:34,074
- Irene.
- Yes, ma'am.

577
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:36,448
- Send in the Kartik girl, please.
- Okay.

578
00:34:37,157 --> 00:34:39,116
Meghna Mathur!
That's me!

579
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:41,657
So you want to be a model?

580
00:34:44,074 --> 00:34:45,116
No ma'am.

581
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:47,116
A super model.

582
00:34:49,116 --> 00:34:50,157
Ambitious.

583
00:34:52,116 --> 00:34:54,074
Do you know the city gets
two hundred girls everyday...

584
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:55,407
... who aspire to be a model.

585
00:34:58,198 --> 00:34:59,323
I know.

586
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:02,074
But... how many of them...

587
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:05,116
... get a chance to sit across you?

588
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:12,074
- Kartik was right, you have spunk.
- Thank you.

589
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:14,698
But that will not suffice.

590
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,657
What did you tell me your name was?

591
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,116
- Meghna...
- Yes, Meghna.

592
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:25,074
Meghna, in the fashion industry...

593
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:29,448
... even a little talent will do.

594
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:32,074
But if you have the wrong attitude...

595
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:34,157
... nothing will work.

596
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,781
You have attitude.

597
00:35:39,156 --> 00:35:42,448
Use it with prudence or
it will be mistaken for arrogance.

598
00:35:44,532 --> 00:35:45,615
That won't happen.

599
00:35:47,074 --> 00:35:48,116
Really!

600
00:35:49,323 --> 00:35:50,365
Yes.

601
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:55,323
Won't you be there to guide me?

602
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,116
I like your confidence.

603
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,365
What are you doing tomorrow?

604
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:02,365
Nothing yet.

605
00:36:13,074 --> 00:36:14,156
Not good?

606
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:19,656
Oh, horrible.

607
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,490
Actually, I don't know
a lot about wines.

608
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:26,698
Don't worry there are
very few over here who do.

609
00:36:27,074 --> 00:36:28,282
At least you are honest.

610
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,116
Ross, two glasses of Merlot, please.

611
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:38,365
- Try this, you'll like it.
- Okay.

612
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,198
Still the same.

613
00:36:47,656 --> 00:36:49,074
You've either tried wine for...

614
00:36:49,156 --> 00:36:51,116
... the first time or had a lot of it.

615
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:52,490
That's why you can't tell the difference.

616
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:58,156
- By the way, I am Abhijeet Sarin.
- I know you, everybody knows you.

617
00:36:58,656 --> 00:37:01,156
- I am Meghna Mathur.
- Now I know you.

618
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:03,490
Want to try something more interesting?

619
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:07,656
- Yes... - Come, let's go.
- Okay. Come.

620
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:09,323
Cheers.

621
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:12,823
These models are so thin.

622
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:14,407
I've heard they do drugs?

623
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:18,323
I don't know. Not all of them,
maybe a few.

624
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:20,323
And guess what, Sheetal...

625
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:23,074
I heard that designer
Varun Ramani's wife is...

626
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:26,156
having an affair with her gym instructor.

627
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:27,490
Then you know the latest.

628
00:37:28,282 --> 00:37:32,115
Rajan Sodhi has hidden
cameras in his wife's bedroom.

629
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:35,115
- And?
- And guess what, she got caught.

630
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:37,156
What are you saying?

631
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:43,823
I just don't understand. How can
people get into such situations?

632
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:51,698
Does she know this?

633
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:15,532
You seem quite intelligent.
So what's this craze for modelling?

634
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:21,656
You too are intelligent and
are also in the same business.

635
00:38:22,074 --> 00:38:24,656
So the comparison is with me...

636
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,614
It's not like that...

637
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:29,282
It doesn't matter.

638
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:32,698
I judge people by their ambition.

639
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,323
Really, so what do you think of me?

640
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,157
You've hardly told me
anything about yourself...

641
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:43,073
What can I say?
Like thousands of girls...

642
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:45,490
I too want to be a successful model.

643
00:38:46,739 --> 00:38:49,823
- But there's a small difference.
- What's that?

644
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:55,698
That I'm better than the rest.

645
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,282
That you are.

646
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,698
- Come, let's go.
- Yes.

647
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,073
You know you're very lucky,
Meghna... What?

648
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:16,157
You've been meeting these people...
Kartik... Sarin.

649
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,073
The formula to this business is...

650
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,823
the right timing, knowing the right
people and the right publicity.

651
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,157
I've thought about it.

652
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,698
I will feature you in Leena Mehta's show.

653
00:39:32,823 --> 00:39:35,157
- Really? Yeah.
- It is a big show.

654
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:38,073
Everything is happening so quickly...

655
00:39:38,157 --> 00:39:40,157
... don't get overconfident.

656
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,323
This is just the first step.

657
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,449
Everything depends on what
you make of this opportunity.

658
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,323
And, where you want to go from here.

659
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,698
I know where I want to reach.

660
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:27,323
- Shona...
- Ritu? Why is she calling you?

661
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:29,115
- Shona my phone...
- You told me she doesn't call you.

662
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:30,323
Shona, give me my phone...

663
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:31,449
- Why did you lie to me?
- Leave my phone.

664
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:34,324
- Why is she calling you? You fool! You lied to me?
- She needs help.

665
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:36,365
- Shona, give me my phone.
- Why? - What are you doing?

666
00:40:36,449 --> 00:40:37,490
Are you the only one who can help her?

667
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:40,490
- Shona...
- You bastard, you are doing it again. You are lying to me.

668
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:43,614
- Let me talk to her. I need to talk to her.
- Shona, leave it.

669
00:40:43,698 --> 00:40:44,740
Shona!

670
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,157
You fool! I have a show tomorrow.

671
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:57,449
Come on, Shona. I told you
there is nothing like that.

672
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,240
She just needs help.

673
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,115
This is my Avant-garde collection.

674
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:04,614
It's completely different
from my earlier work.

675
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:08,115
I mean, this collection is inspired
by my childhood memories.

676
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:09,823
My mother, my grandmother!

677
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:13,157
You will see influences
of those images.

678
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:16,115
I don't know how it is going to be...

679
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:18,115
... accepted, but it is very special to me.

680
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:20,115
What's this? Made in Bangkok.

681
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,781
At least she should have taken
off the label before the show.

682
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:25,115
She gets it from the
Indra market in Bangkok...

683
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:27,698
and calls it her
Avant-garde collection.

684
00:41:28,823 --> 00:41:30,115
Some designer.

685
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,531
Darling, you are looking beautiful.

686
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,656
Look here...

687
00:41:35,615 --> 00:41:38,115
- Slowly, it hurts.
- Sorry.

688
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:50,115
Salim, darling.
I am the show stopper.

689
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:53,615
Come overfor my make-up
or should I stop the show?

690
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,115
- Can you just finish it by yourself?
- It is okay.

691
00:41:58,157 --> 00:41:59,240
Thank you.

692
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,531
Yes, darling.

693
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,157
- You look sad.
- Not at all.

694
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,282
Would you like to go back?

695
00:42:09,365 --> 00:42:10,823
No. Let'sjust do your make-up.

696
00:42:23,823 --> 00:42:25,198
Please, show me. Show me.

697
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:27,698
Next... next.

698
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:30,823
- This?
- Yes. Print this.

699
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,781
- Okay.
- Thank you, bye.

700
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:34,115
Okay, ma'am. No problem.

701
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:39,365
Chandu, why are you
clicking a nobody?

702
00:42:39,449 --> 00:42:41,823
Fool, do you know how
big a socialite she is?

703
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:45,448
Socialite? Once upon
a time she was a B-grade actress.

704
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:48,781
Today she is a self proclaimed
socialite and designer.

705
00:42:49,115 --> 00:42:50,157
Are you kidding me?

706
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,240
She is at every function:
Weddings, parties, awards...

707
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:56,115
She doesn't even spare baby showers.

708
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,240
Are you kidding me?

709
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,365
Baby shower?

710
00:42:58,448 --> 00:42:59,489
Yes, even baby showers.

711
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:04,157
Delete her pictures. Terrible!

712
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:09,656
- Oh hi!
- How are you?

713
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:12,407
I am fine. What brings you here?

714
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,282
Well, I came to meet Leena.
Networking, you know.

715
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,656
I got to know that it is yourfirst show so...

716
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:21,656
- I came to wish you luck.
- Thanks.

717
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:24,573
- All the best. - Thanks.
Thank you. - And... - Thanks.

718
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:27,781
Don't be nervous,
you'll bejust fine, okay?

719
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:33,115
Pooja... isn't that Madhur Bhandarkar?

720
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:34,573
What's he doing with Rita?

721
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:36,698
He's probably doing his research.

722
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:38,448
He's making a movie on fashion.

723
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:40,823
He makes realistic films.

724
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,823
He won't even spare
the world of fashion.

725
00:43:43,115 --> 00:43:45,448
Now remember, I want a lot of drama.

726
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:48,698
- Is that clear?
- Look at the clothes. They are so dramatic.

727
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:52,115
No expression. I just want you
to look straight, look strong...

728
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,157
... no smiles. Am I clear?

729
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:58,615
Binal, walk tall and beautiful.

730
00:43:59,282 --> 00:44:02,115
- Meghna. This is a huge show for you.
- Yes.

731
00:44:02,282 --> 00:44:04,656
I want lots of attitude.
Do you understand that?

732
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:08,282
- Yes... yes, ma'am.
- And Shonali... Shonali.

733
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:10,823
Yes, yes. I know, I am listening.

734
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:14,406
Alright. Great. Okay girls,
let's go out there and kill them.

735
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:16,365
Are you ready?
Come on. Let's go.

736
00:44:17,865 --> 00:44:19,823
Okay girls, come on. Stand in a line.

737
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,448
Come on, we are ready
to start the show. Come on.

738
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:25,782
Yes, okay. Okay, she is on. She is on.

739
00:44:25,865 --> 00:44:27,324
- Get out!
- Go Shonali, go.

740
00:44:27,406 --> 00:44:28,490
Please, go.

741
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:23,240
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

742
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:26,199
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

743
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:32,115
<i>"For your love, I shall give up my life. "</i>

744
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:36,199
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

745
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:38,864
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

746
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:44,864
<i>"For your love, I shall give up my life. "</i>

747
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:52,365
<i>"Your Kohl enchants me. "</i>

748
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:58,531
<i>"It's the time to fall in love. "</i>

749
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,448
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

750
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:04,864

751
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:11,115
<i>"For your love, I shall give up my life. "</i>

752
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:17,240

753
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:24,324
<i>"For your love, I shall give up my life. "</i>

754
00:47:01,282 --> 00:47:02,864
That was such an impressive show.

755
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:05,740
You were fantastic as always, Shonali.

756
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,782
Thank you so much.

757
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:09,740
Panache is extremely proud of you.

758
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:11,698
You are the face of Panache.

759
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:14,282
We'll have to extend your contract.

760
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,864
Oh, come on Abhi,
stop discussing work.

761
00:47:17,115 --> 00:47:18,323
Shonali, join us for a drink.

762
00:47:19,323 --> 00:47:20,782
- Come on...
- Yes, come on.

763
00:47:20,864 --> 00:47:22,531
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

764
00:47:24,115 --> 00:47:25,199
No. Really. Really.

765
00:47:25,282 --> 00:47:26,323
Wasn't that amazing?

766
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:27,448
- She just walked on.
- Thank you.

767
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:28,657
And beyond looked at...

768
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,157
- You were fantastic, fabulous.
- Really?

769
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,657
- Really.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

770
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,782
What grace... what poise... oh my God.

771
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:38,531
I was so nervous. Janet Sequeira!

772
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:41,157
- Rahul Arora!
- Oh my God.

773
00:47:44,157 --> 00:47:46,615
- How long it has been?
- Six years.

774
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,490
Look at you.

775
00:47:49,448 --> 00:47:51,157
How much weight have
you lost since college?

776
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:52,282
I had to diet to become a model.

777
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,864
And dieting made me like this.

778
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:56,864
You and diet?

779
00:47:57,282 --> 00:47:59,115
- You know... Rohit, right?
- Yes.

780
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,782
- You know... when we were in college...
- Yes.

781
00:48:00,864 --> 00:48:03,115
During college she used
to carry a box of sugar candy.

782
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,406
Sugar! Calories!

783
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:09,490
We all used laugh at her.

784
00:48:09,864 --> 00:48:11,406
Should I reveal your secrets?

785
00:48:11,448 --> 00:48:13,864
- Oh... no secrets, okay?
- Okay.

786
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:16,782
- Besides I am very upset with you.
- Why?

787
00:48:16,864 --> 00:48:18,782
You are a model now and
you didn't even bother to call.

788
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:20,615
Rahul, you know this business.

789
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:24,323
You are an A list designer
and I'm a struggling B list model.

790
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:25,573
How could I call?

791
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,115
- You know it is not like that with me, right?
- Yes, I know...

792
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,115
- Give me a call.
- I will.

793
00:48:32,365 --> 00:48:34,448
Okay, by the way meet my friend, Meghna.

794
00:48:34,532 --> 00:48:36,406
- Hi... - Nice meeting you.
- Rahul Arora.

795
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,448
- Yes, of course. I've heard...
- You were great on the ramp.

796
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:40,115
Good confidence.
Good presence. Right?

797
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:44,864
- Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye.
- I will. Bye.

798
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,406
- You know him? You never told us.
- Yes. Well...

799
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,448
- Hi Christine.
- Hi, Christine.

800
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:52,241
Well done, Meghna.

801
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:54,115
Such good confidence in yourfirst show...

802
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:57,406
- ... l'm really impressed.
- Really?

803
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,281
I am sure, you'll go a long way. Bye.

804
00:49:02,698 --> 00:49:06,157
Did you hearthat Meghna darling?
You will go a long way.

805
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:07,657
Very well done. Very well done.

806
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,281
- I told you so.
- Imagine.

807
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:35,698
After many trials and troubles
I reached a place...

808
00:49:35,781 --> 00:49:39,864
... where I could see my dream
taking shape clearly.

809
00:49:41,157 --> 00:49:45,406
But myjourney ahead went
through strange phases.

810
00:49:46,657 --> 00:49:49,157
Old relationships though
near seemed far away.

811
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,157
And new relationships
started growing closer.

812
00:49:58,323 --> 00:50:00,240
This restaurant is really posh, Meghna.

813
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:02,157
We are going to get a huge bill.

814
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,781
Just relax and order.

815
00:50:03,864 --> 00:50:05,698
- It's very...
- Its okay.

816
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:10,573
- Hey Rahul! Hi! How are you?
- Hi!

817
00:50:10,657 --> 00:50:12,116
- How are you doing?
- Very well.

818
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,739
- Do you know, Meghna... Manav...
- Hi.

819
00:50:13,823 --> 00:50:14,864
- Rohit...
- Hi.

820
00:50:15,823 --> 00:50:17,781
- Hi... this is Ashish.
- Hi. - Hi. - Nice meeting you.

821
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:19,698
Why don't you guys join us?

822
00:50:20,406 --> 00:50:21,864
Yes, sure. Sure.

823
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:24,448
- Sure.
- Okay.

824
00:50:24,739 --> 00:50:26,157
- Excuse me. Two chairs, please.
- Yes.

825
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:27,281
- Yes.
- Sure, sir.

826
00:50:27,698 --> 00:50:30,323
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Why do you say that?

827
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:34,157
I wasjust being polite and
you actuallyjoined us.

828
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,823
- How rude.
- I can't believe this.

829
00:50:36,864 --> 00:50:39,864
You know, throughout college,
I used to foot her canteen bills.

830
00:50:40,323 --> 00:50:42,739
So I thought it was payback time today.

831
00:50:42,823 --> 00:50:44,281
- To say...
- By the way...

832
00:50:44,365 --> 00:50:45,490
Unfortunately, it's Meghna's treat.

833
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:47,157
- Oh, I am sorry.
- Yes, this is my treat.

834
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,864
Come on, let's order starters guys.

835
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:50,490
- Hi...
- Hi.

836
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:53,698
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure

837
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:57,157
Do you have a brother
or cousin who looks...

838
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:58,657
... just like you do.

839
00:50:58,864 --> 00:51:02,157
- Sorry, bad luck.
- No... - Oh no!

840
00:51:08,448 --> 00:51:10,157
Listen, you do know that...

841
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:12,823
the venue for tomorrows rehearsal has
changed, don't you?

842
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,157
It's Four Seasons now.

843
00:51:15,532 --> 00:51:17,864
- Anyways, thanks for telling me.
- Oh no, not at all.

844
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:19,281
- Bye.
- Bye, take care.

845
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:22,698
- Bye.
- See you. Bye.

846
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:34,490
Santosh...

847
00:51:34,657 --> 00:51:35,864
It's two in the morning, Meghna.

848
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:38,573
You've been coming in late every night.

849
00:51:39,198 --> 00:51:41,157
You should be a little more responsible.

850
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,323
Even the neighbours are complaining.

851
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:46,157
This can't continue here.

852
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:48,823
I'm sorry, aunt, but my job keeps me...

853
00:51:48,864 --> 00:51:50,240
I know what it keeps you at.

854
00:51:52,657 --> 00:51:55,698
Divya brought this to
show us from the neighbors.

855
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:58,157
What influence will it have on her?

856
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:02,157
Meghna, we can't let your career be...

857
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,365
... a negative influence on Divya.

858
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:07,157
I suggest you...

859
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,157
... look for alternate accommodation.

860
00:52:10,157 --> 00:52:11,823
Santosh, it's so late in the night...

861
00:52:11,906 --> 00:52:13,823
She doesn't need to leave immediately.

862
00:52:15,906 --> 00:52:17,157
She can leave after a couple of days.

863
00:52:17,657 --> 00:52:18,698
It's okay aunt...

864
00:52:20,323 --> 00:52:21,448
I'll leave right away.

865
00:52:29,157 --> 00:52:30,657
- Janet.
- Hi, how are you?

866
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:32,157
- Hi... sorry to call you so late.
- What?

867
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,157
I'm on my way to Goa.
Is everything all right?

868
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,864
Anything urgent,
message me, darling.

869
00:52:38,157 --> 00:52:39,282
No. Nothing at all.

870
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,823
- Okay, yes. Bye.
- Okay. Bye. See you.

871
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:52,906
I left home in a huff but
I didn't know where to go.

872
00:52:53,906 --> 00:52:57,407
Janet is in Goa and
Rohit stays with his parents.

873
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,323
I don't know anyone else in Mumbai.

874
00:53:01,198 --> 00:53:02,448
I'm really sorry but...

875
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:03,906
There is no need for an explanation.

876
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:06,698
I'm glad that you called.

877
00:53:08,282 --> 00:53:09,615
It's only fortonight.

878
00:53:09,906 --> 00:53:11,532
I'll look for another place tomorrow.

879
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,198
Meghna, this is Mumbai.

880
00:53:15,156 --> 00:53:16,823
You may find God but not accommodation.

881
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:18,573
That too, a single woman...

882
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:21,698
... a model, no way.

883
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:26,156
Yes, there is one place though...

884
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,407
... where you can share an apartment.

885
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:30,739
- Where?
- Here.

886
00:53:33,698 --> 00:53:36,407
Actually, I was looking
for a room mate.

887
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,156
I don't have regular work...

888
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,198
... and the rent is too high.

889
00:53:42,739 --> 00:53:44,574
So, if you don't mind.
We can share this apartment.

890
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:49,156
But Manav, both of us...

891
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,198
... in the same apartment...

892
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:53,532
... won't it be awkward?

893
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:56,240
Come on Meghna,
this isn't Chandigarh.

894
00:53:57,532 --> 00:53:59,156
I mean, no one cares.

895
00:54:00,656 --> 00:54:05,156
Rent, provisions...
we'll share the expenses.

896
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:08,156
We can share everything...

897
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,823
... but the bedrooms will be separate, right?

898
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,698
Of course! They will be separate,
you can be sure of that.

899
00:54:23,614 --> 00:54:25,614
- Okay.
- Okay.

900
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:28,156
Okay, great! Welcome home.

901
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:30,156
Anisha, I'm sorry I had to call you.

902
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:31,490
Where is Shonali?

903
00:54:31,574 --> 00:54:33,156
The entire unit has been
waiting fortwo hours...

904
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,906
... there is no sign of her.

905
00:54:35,156 --> 00:54:36,240
This has become a habit.

906
00:54:36,282 --> 00:54:38,323
- Please, help me. Please do something now.
- Oh no!

907
00:54:39,156 --> 00:54:41,448
Tony, give me two minutes.

908
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:50,739
- Shonali...
- She is in there.

909
00:54:51,448 --> 00:54:54,698
Shonali... come out of there.

910
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,448
Come out, right now!

911
00:54:58,906 --> 00:55:00,157
What's your problem Anisha?

912
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:02,240
The entire unit has been
waiting fortwo hours...

913
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:04,282
It's a big ad film shoot,
for heaven sake.

914
00:55:04,365 --> 00:55:06,574
And you are back
to this awful habit.

915
00:55:11,365 --> 00:55:12,781
You better buck up, Shonali.

916
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:16,448
This is the third complaint.

917
00:55:16,698 --> 00:55:19,240
Our clients pay a lot of
money for your time.

918
00:55:19,823 --> 00:55:21,157
It's only because of
my agency and my reputation...

919
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,157
... that's the reason you
stand here today.

920
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:25,157
If you don' take control of yourself...

921
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,614
... then there are several others
who are eager to replace you. Got it?

922
00:55:38,157 --> 00:55:39,823
- Don't worry...
- Megha, Gauri...

923
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:42,906
If she misbehaves,
call me up again.

924
00:55:47,698 --> 00:55:50,157
<i>"Temptation next. "</i>

925
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,656
<i>"Temptation next. "</i>

926
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:59,157
No... don't argue Koko.
I know exactly...

927
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,240
... what's going to be good on you,
okay? Trust me.

928
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:04,365
Vinay, isn't this a bit over the top?

929
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:06,157
I mean... just look at this.

930
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,823
You are about to do
Bobby Chopra's film in Europe.

931
00:56:11,365 --> 00:56:15,449
- And today everything is about looking glamorous. Okay?
- Yes, but.

932
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,614
You guys do very realistic films and...

933
00:56:18,323 --> 00:56:22,573
Yes, I mean, this is mainstream
cinema and you have to look hot.

934
00:56:22,906 --> 00:56:26,449
I am the only one who can make
you look hot. Okay? Period.

935
00:56:26,823 --> 00:56:27,906
I don't know, Vinay.

936
00:56:28,323 --> 00:56:30,740
- According to my character graph, I mean...
- Dear, no...

937
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:32,740
Ranveer, just help me. Just look.

938
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:36,157
Koko, the amount the producer is
spending on your clothes...

939
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,157
exceeds the total budget
of this film production.

940
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,823
So if you're done arguing,
can we rehearse?

941
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:43,490
The entire unit has been
waiting fortwo hours...

942
00:56:43,573 --> 00:56:45,157
... and a lot of people work on daily wages.

943
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,781
- Wages.
- Okay, Vinay, whatever.

944
00:56:47,823 --> 00:56:48,906
Come on, roll the camera.

945
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:52,157
- Its fine, I surrender.
- Baby, trust me. You'll rock.

946
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,656
- Really?
- You doubt Vinay Khosla? Come on, baby.

947
00:56:56,157 --> 00:56:57,614
Come on, take it.

948
00:56:57,698 --> 00:57:00,781
Hey Manav, whom are you paired
with in Anamika's show?

949
00:57:01,198 --> 00:57:02,323
I have been paired with Rajneesh.

950
00:57:03,198 --> 00:57:04,240
Not anymore.

951
00:57:04,531 --> 00:57:05,573
What do you mean?

952
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:07,698
Now your entry is along with me.

953
00:57:08,198 --> 00:57:09,365
We open the show together now.

954
00:57:09,781 --> 00:57:11,656
Really? But how come?

955
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:14,157
Because our choreographer believes...

956
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,698
... that we make a great pair.

957
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:17,323
And I agree.

958
00:57:35,407 --> 00:57:39,240
<i>"It's special. "</i>

959
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:42,906
<i>"It's an unusual feeling. "</i>

960
00:57:43,198 --> 00:57:46,906
<i>"Some distance, closeness...</i>

961
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:50,656
<i>... keeps my loneliness away. "</i>

962
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:54,449
<i>"Is it love?"</i>

963
00:57:54,531 --> 00:57:57,906
<i>"Is it trust? Maybe it's love. "</i>

964
00:57:58,198 --> 00:58:02,157
<i>"This is blossoms. This waiting... "</i>

965
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,198
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

966
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:13,740
<i>"It's special. "</i>

967
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,573
<i>"It's an unusual feeling. "</i>

968
00:58:17,656 --> 00:58:21,449
<i>"Some distance, closeness...</i>

969
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:25,157
<i>... keeps my loneliness away. "</i>

970
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,906
<i>"Is it love?"</i>

971
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:32,781
<i>"Is it trust? Maybe it's love. "</i>

972
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:36,615
<i>"This is blossoms. This waiting... "</i>

973
00:58:36,698 --> 00:58:40,531
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

974
00:58:57,906 --> 00:59:05,324
<i>"What to say?"</i>

975
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:13,573
<i>"Show your heart someone close to you. "</i>

976
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:20,907
<i>"I had a condition. "</i>

977
00:59:21,198 --> 00:59:28,573
<i>"I feel I have won this lost round. "</i>

978
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,198
<i>"This is impatient waiting... "</i>

979
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:36,365
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

980
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:39,865
<i>"It's magic. "</i>

981
00:59:39,907 --> 00:59:42,198
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

982
00:59:42,907 --> 00:59:45,199
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

983
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,907
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

984
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:55,407
<i>"Something is special. "</i>

985
00:59:55,573 --> 00:59:59,698
<i>"It's an unusual feeling. "</i>

986
01:00:28,282 --> 01:00:29,907
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

987
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:35,199
<i>"Maybe it's love. "</i>

988
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,240
- Just see...
- Let me read.

989
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,907
Forget what you are reading.
Just look at that.

990
01:00:48,947 --> 01:00:50,240
- Please give me the phone.
- No.

991
01:00:50,282 --> 01:00:51,907
- Give me the phone.
- No way, please.

992
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,573
Forget your phone.

993
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,407
Oh hi, Anisha.

994
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,531
Where are you?

995
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:58,907
At home.

996
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:01,199
Sarin wants to see you immediately.

997
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:03,240
Right now?

998
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:05,199
No questions Meghna.
Please go over right now.

999
01:01:05,282 --> 01:01:07,407
Okay, I'll go. Bye.

1000
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:20,365
- Meghna, please come.
- Oh... come.

1001
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:36,282
Anisha told me... I had to rush...
to come to see you... in the office.

1002
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:40,656
I've brought my portfolio along.
I also have it on CD.

1003
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,906
If you want to have a look.

1004
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:46,656
There's no need forthis.

1005
01:01:48,282 --> 01:01:49,656
Would you like to be a show stopper?

1006
01:01:51,573 --> 01:01:52,740
It's for Vinay Khosla.

1007
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:55,240
The show is in four days.

1008
01:01:57,324 --> 01:01:58,782
You think you'll be able to do it?

1009
01:02:01,947 --> 01:02:03,865
- Vinay Khosla?
- Yes.

1010
01:02:04,573 --> 01:02:07,531
- Oh my God, you mean 'The Vinay Khosla? '
- That's right.

1011
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:12,615
Yes, of course. Thank you.

1012
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,199
For the first time,

1013
01:02:19,282 --> 01:02:22,199
- I don't have a single Bollywood
starlet in the front row. - So sad.

1014
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:23,865
Half of them are doing shows and...

1015
01:02:23,947 --> 01:02:25,199
- ... the other half are abroad.
- Oh what a pity?

1016
01:02:25,947 --> 01:02:28,199
What's happening with
the new girl? Is she ready?

1017
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:31,324
- Just two minutes. - No, no.
You go and check. Go. Go! - Okay.

1018
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:33,199
I've got a very huge offer.

1019
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:38,615
Ladies and gentlemen,
kindly take your seat.

1020
01:02:38,656 --> 01:02:40,740
The show is about to begin.

1021
01:02:41,656 --> 01:02:43,199
Darling, you look gorgeous.

1022
01:02:43,282 --> 01:02:44,324
And you are biased.

1023
01:02:44,864 --> 01:02:47,531
No, no Meghna. It goes over.

1024
01:02:47,823 --> 01:02:49,740
But it looks so much cooler here.

1025
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:54,199
She is an absolute new girl.
And a show stopper?

1026
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:57,448
- And handsome looks. Handsome looks, okay? - Okay.

1027
01:02:57,531 --> 01:03:00,199
- I just hope she is good. I just hope.
- Okay.

1028
01:03:00,282 --> 01:03:02,864
- I am so stressed. I am so stressed. This is not funny. - Relax.

1029
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,448
Sarin's recommendation and all that.

1030
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,199
Anyway, I'll just... where is Rohit?

1031
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,282
- Just you know...
- Where is Rohit?

1032
01:03:10,823 --> 01:03:12,282
Meghna, you should... because...

1033
01:03:12,365 --> 01:03:14,406
- Meghna, I was telling you...
- Rohit.

1034
01:03:16,823 --> 01:03:22,947
Oh what the... who the hell
has done it like this?

1035
01:03:23,657 --> 01:03:25,199
It is supposed to go
above the head, no?

1036
01:03:25,282 --> 01:03:26,740
- Rohit... Duffer...
- Yes...

1037
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,657
You know how particular I am.

1038
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,864
Actually... It's not his fault.
I told him.

1039
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,531
You?

1040
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:33,864
I thought that if...

1041
01:03:33,947 --> 01:03:37,947
Hold it. You thought?
Darling, you are a model.

1042
01:03:38,365 --> 01:03:40,947
You don't need to
use your brains, okay?

1043
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:42,490
Spare me the horror.

1044
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:45,199
- Fix the lousy thing, Rohit.
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1045
01:03:45,282 --> 01:03:47,199
It's such an insignificant thing...

1046
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:52,531
What did you say?
An insignificant thing?

1047
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,282
This is the show stopper outfit.

1048
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,864
Do you understand that?

1049
01:03:57,531 --> 01:03:59,406
The media will be watching.
All of them.

1050
01:04:00,948 --> 01:04:02,199
And even if you sell yourself,

1051
01:04:02,282 --> 01:04:04,406
you can't afford this dress. Alright?

1052
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:08,199
And listen,
I really don't care about...

1053
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:10,698
... your relationship with Sarin.

1054
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:12,864
I don't want supermodel nonsense.

1055
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:14,448
My relationship with Sarin?

1056
01:04:14,822 --> 01:04:17,698
- You have no right to say that.
- Oh yeah? Really?

1057
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,948
I don't have a right?
In my show?

1058
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:24,698
Do you even know, who I am?

1059
01:04:25,864 --> 01:04:28,948
Vinay Khosla...
and nobody talks to me like that.

1060
01:04:31,365 --> 01:04:34,657
Rohit, tell Christina I am
replacing this girl right now.

1061
01:04:34,698 --> 01:04:35,864
Change the whole thing.

1062
01:04:35,948 --> 01:04:38,490
Send four girls in the end.
Change the finale. I don't care.

1063
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:41,323
And you! Out of this outfit and leave! Out!

1064
01:04:42,822 --> 01:04:44,740
- But sir... No... no...
- What! - Nothing, sir.

1065
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:46,740
Come on, now all of you get on with it.

1066
01:04:46,822 --> 01:04:48,199
Come on, back to work.

1067
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,241
No wonder we models are
treated like hangers.

1068
01:05:26,573 --> 01:05:29,948
Okay girls, listen. Quickly listen.
There's been a change, alright?

1069
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:32,615
I want the last four girls
to end the sequence.

1070
01:05:32,698 --> 01:05:34,657
The last four girls being Geeta...
you right?

1071
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,657
- What about that young girl?
- Don't know about her.

1072
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:38,448
Thank you. Excuse me.

1073
01:05:38,532 --> 01:05:40,241
Sir, there is a problem backstage.
I think you should come.

1074
01:05:41,948 --> 01:05:44,199
Okay. Excuse me.

1075
01:05:49,532 --> 01:05:52,698
What the hell.
She has ruined the whole show.

1076
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,241
- What's the problem, Vinay?
- She's arrogant.

1077
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:56,406
Why don't you ask him?

1078
01:05:56,490 --> 01:06:00,906
- Don't believe me, then...
- Alright. - Sarin...

1079
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,781
Meghna!

1080
01:06:14,657 --> 01:06:20,948
Meghna, you still have those bangles...
We need them back...

1081
01:06:25,241 --> 01:06:27,573
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1082
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:30,906
- I am really sorry about this.
- It's okay.

1083
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:13,573
How could he think that I...

1084
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:14,823
Calm down, Meghna.

1085
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:17,698
People say stuff when they're angry.

1086
01:07:19,906 --> 01:07:21,240
You could've controlled yourself.

1087
01:07:23,323 --> 01:07:24,698
So it was my fault?

1088
01:07:26,406 --> 01:07:27,448
Do you even know what he said?

1089
01:07:27,532 --> 01:07:29,323
Listen, I know it wasn't your fault.

1090
01:07:31,323 --> 01:07:34,365
Besides he is a veteran designer
and you are new to modelling.

1091
01:07:35,948 --> 01:07:37,657
Does that mean he can say
whatever he wants?

1092
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:41,240
So what if he is a reputed designer?

1093
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:43,240
I'm no average model either.

1094
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:44,490
Come on, I know, Meghna.

1095
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:47,781
You'll never understand.

1096
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,240
Tell me Anisha...

1097
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,407
... when is Shonali's contract up for renewal?

1098
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,615
There is time yet.

1099
01:08:06,864 --> 01:08:09,323
Five months I think, why?

1100
01:08:09,823 --> 01:08:10,948
Terminate her contract.

1101
01:08:12,948 --> 01:08:14,240
Right now!

1102
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:19,781
But Sarin, we can't do that.

1103
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:21,240
Why not?

1104
01:08:21,281 --> 01:08:23,823
Panache is my company
and I can do whatever I want.

1105
01:08:25,323 --> 01:08:27,407
But... it's a contract.

1106
01:08:27,948 --> 01:08:29,240
I mean...

1107
01:08:29,281 --> 01:08:30,532
... it hasn't expired as yet.

1108
01:08:30,657 --> 01:08:32,448
Give Shonali full compensation...

1109
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:34,240
... in fact give her a little more...

1110
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:35,490
... so that there are no complaints.

1111
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:39,573
- But...
- No questions. Just do it.

1112
01:08:43,615 --> 01:08:45,240
But on what grounds?

1113
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:48,739
Come on, Anisha.
You are smart.

1114
01:08:48,948 --> 01:08:50,948
You'll think of something.
I am sure.

1115
01:08:57,448 --> 01:09:00,407
I don't understand,
why, Anisha? Why?

1116
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,906
I warned you a couple of times earlier...

1117
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:06,240
... but you didn't listen.

1118
01:09:06,991 --> 01:09:08,698
Three official complaints!

1119
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:11,448
Ultimately professionalism counts.

1120
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:16,532
Come on Anisha,
I know this profession.

1121
01:09:17,281 --> 01:09:19,657
Three complaints and I am out?

1122
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:21,906
It's not just that, Shonali.

1123
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,240
Your lifestyle...

1124
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,781
... your boyfriends...

1125
01:09:25,323 --> 01:09:27,948
... your addiction and
misbehaviour at parties.

1126
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:31,407
It's affecting the brands,
especially Panache.

1127
01:09:33,323 --> 01:09:34,864
This was bound to happen someday.

1128
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:41,615
Anyway...
I didn't want to be unfair.

1129
01:09:42,573 --> 01:09:44,240
The compensation is higher.

1130
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:46,240
If there is anything that

1131
01:09:46,323 --> 01:09:48,864
you want to add to the termination
clause, go ahead.

1132
01:10:11,656 --> 01:10:12,781
Just one question.

1133
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:15,240
Who has replaced me?

1134
01:10:16,823 --> 01:10:17,864
Meghna Mathur.

1135
01:10:22,573 --> 01:10:25,991
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
and my friends from the media.

1136
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:28,823
This is the moment we've
all been waiting for.

1137
01:10:29,615 --> 01:10:31,282
Allow me to introduce to you,

1138
01:10:31,365 --> 01:10:35,906
the sensational new face
of Panache... Meghna Mathur.

1139
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,906
- So glamorous. So nervous.
- I know.

1140
01:11:13,698 --> 01:11:15,240
- But he was so good...
- Excuse me.

1141
01:11:15,323 --> 01:11:17,365
I am going to take her
away for a minute.

1142
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:19,240
- Yes, sure. Sure.
- I'll just be back. - Yes, sure.

1143
01:11:19,323 --> 01:11:21,240
- Hi.
- I want to introduce you to...

1144
01:11:22,698 --> 01:11:25,739
- Avantika... Meet Meghna Mathur.
- Yes.

1145
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,323
- This is Avantika Sarin.
- Oh hi.

1146
01:11:27,365 --> 01:11:30,365
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you Meghna.

1147
01:11:30,448 --> 01:11:32,698
All the very best and
welcome to Panache.

1148
01:11:32,781 --> 01:11:33,823
Thank you so much.

1149
01:11:34,865 --> 01:11:38,240
In no time my dreams
turned into reality...

1150
01:11:38,323 --> 01:11:40,282
... and they reached the sky.

1151
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:46,240
My new image as a super
model everywhere...

1152
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:48,365
... gave me a new high.

1153
01:11:50,614 --> 01:11:55,407
I felt like the whole world
was interested in no one but me.

1154
01:11:55,490 --> 01:11:58,240
I got lost in myself.

1155
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:02,240
Knowing what I wear...
what I eat... what I think...

1156
01:12:02,323 --> 01:12:05,365
possibly made people think
that they know me.

1157
01:12:06,698 --> 01:12:08,240
I too was lost in myself.

1158
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,240
But I... I just had one obsession.

1159
01:12:12,323 --> 01:12:15,991
What would be my next
move to attain more success...

1160
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,282
- What's so different in the soup?
- I have no idea.

1161
01:12:21,365 --> 01:12:22,407
On the salad.

1162
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:24,240
- Hey guys. I am really sorry.
- Hi.

1163
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:25,365
- Hi...
- Hi.

1164
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:29,656
You are so late, baby. You knew
this dinner was planned, right?

1165
01:12:29,739 --> 01:12:32,614
Yes, but the campaign is about
to begin and you know how it is.

1166
01:12:32,991 --> 01:12:36,240
I am sorry guys, I'll be right
back from the loo in five minutes.

1167
01:12:36,323 --> 01:12:37,449
There she goes.

1168
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:38,739
Come, come. Sit, sit.

1169
01:12:38,823 --> 01:12:39,991
We'll be here.

1170
01:12:53,906 --> 01:12:54,991
Hi Shonali.

1171
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,365
Congratulations... for Panache.

1172
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,323
Thanks, Shonali.

1173
01:13:17,656 --> 01:13:20,240
Look, I hope you understand,
there's nothing personal.

1174
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:23,991
- I didn't know that, its going to...
- Don't worry.

1175
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:26,656
Neither did I...

1176
01:13:28,532 --> 01:13:30,240
It's this industry...

1177
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,740
... you never know when
the designs are outdated.

1178
01:13:39,490 --> 01:13:44,282
- No thanks.
- Smart, but be careful.

1179
01:13:46,365 --> 01:13:47,407
You're still new.

1180
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,240
Everything feels good in the beginning...

1181
01:13:52,323 --> 01:13:54,614
... the novelty eventually wears out.

1182
01:13:58,948 --> 01:14:00,449
I can see it in your eyes.

1183
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:07,531
You will neither recognise
yourself nor anyone else.

1184
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:11,781
Be very careful.

1185
01:14:17,282 --> 01:14:21,240
Thanks Shonali, but I recognise...

1186
01:14:24,781 --> 01:14:26,323
Myself...

1187
01:14:26,407 --> 01:14:28,407
and others as well.

1188
01:14:33,449 --> 01:14:34,531
We'll see.

1189
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:51,490
- It's really taking... - As I told you,
Meghna, this is just the beginning.

1190
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:52,865
- Yes...
- See, how things go.

1191
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,656
- Hi, Mr. Sarin...
- Nice to meet you.

1192
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:55,865
Our new face of Panache,
Meghna Mathur.

1193
01:14:55,948 --> 01:14:58,282
- Meghna, that is Manohar Grover.
- Hello.

1194
01:14:58,324 --> 01:14:59,573
- Hi.
- Hello.

1195
01:14:59,656 --> 01:15:00,991
- Meet Mr. Stevens. That's his beautiful wife.
- Hello.

1196
01:15:01,282 --> 01:15:02,781
- Hello. - Hi.
- Mrs. Chang, Meghna Mathur.

1197
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:03,906
- Pleased to meet you.
- How are you doing?

1198
01:15:03,991 --> 01:15:05,282
- That's Mr. Harper.
- Hi. - Hello.

1199
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:06,906
- Nice to meet you.
- He's a whiz kid.

1200
01:15:06,991 --> 01:15:08,282
Oh!

1201
01:15:10,614 --> 01:15:11,698
Cheers.

1202
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:14,823
Alright, then.

1203
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:20,948
If we wait any longer...

1204
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:23,282
I'll have to head to
office from here only.

1205
01:15:24,991 --> 01:15:27,282
- Let's go.
- Yes. Come.

1206
01:15:28,282 --> 01:15:29,990
No, that's it. You can stop here.

1207
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:31,781
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1208
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:32,906
I'll get down.

1209
01:15:33,282 --> 01:15:35,656
- Thank you, good night.
- Good night, bye. - Bye.

1210
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,781
Bye.

1211
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:43,698
I know... I know.

1212
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:44,990
Even I know the time.

1213
01:15:45,823 --> 01:15:49,282
- Meghna...
- Look Manav not now, I am really tired, okay?

1214
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:50,990
Meghna, I was worried.

1215
01:15:52,407 --> 01:15:53,573
I tried calling you all night.

1216
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:56,324
The phone was on silent
and in the bag.

1217
01:15:56,407 --> 01:15:57,823
I don't know. Oh God, Manav...

1218
01:15:57,865 --> 01:15:59,990
You knew I was with
Mr. Sarin at a party.

1219
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:02,449
Listen, but you could have
sent me a text message.

1220
01:16:03,282 --> 01:16:05,781
- I would have if I could have.
- You are right.

1221
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,531
Meghna, this is the fourth time.

1222
01:16:10,282 --> 01:16:11,990
I am a model too. I know.

1223
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:15,948
Exactly! You're a model too,
so I thought you would understand...

1224
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,282
but obviously not.

1225
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,282
There were so many people at the party...

1226
01:16:19,324 --> 01:16:21,656
Sarin was introducing me to
the media, so I was... I couldn't.

1227
01:16:23,365 --> 01:16:25,282
And you forgot that
someone's waiting for you...

1228
01:16:25,823 --> 01:16:27,573
Manav, these are really important people.

1229
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:30,282
You won't understand the pressures.

1230
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,282
- Really? So make me.
- How do I?

1231
01:16:33,449 --> 01:16:35,698
You aren't in that league.
You are still struggling.

1232
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:47,324
Meghna, I am really happy
that you are in the big league.

1233
01:16:48,990 --> 01:16:52,407
But have you thought about
the price you're paying for that?

1234
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:53,990
A lecture at four in the morning!

1235
01:16:54,282 --> 01:16:58,282
I am lecturing you because
not everybody can handle success.

1236
01:16:59,656 --> 01:17:00,698
Is that so?

1237
01:17:01,282 --> 01:17:02,324
Then tell me...

1238
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:05,282
... why are those
who preach about success...

1239
01:17:05,324 --> 01:17:07,448
... only those who haven't tasted it yet?

1240
01:17:10,865 --> 01:17:12,990
Because they don't run after it insanely.

1241
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,947
And what if Mr. Sarin were promoting you?

1242
01:17:20,865 --> 01:17:21,907
Why would he?

1243
01:17:22,448 --> 01:17:23,823
He's promoting you, isn't he?

1244
01:17:24,615 --> 01:17:26,282
Who knows what he is getting in return...

1245
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:40,282
I can't believe you just said that.
How typical, Manav.

1246
01:17:43,698 --> 01:17:46,282
I don't know why,
but I thought you were different.

1247
01:17:47,865 --> 01:17:49,656
I'd also thought the same about you.

1248
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:02,740
<i>"Something is special. It's close to me. "</i>

1249
01:18:03,823 --> 01:18:09,407
<i>"It's an unusual feeling. "</i>

1250
01:18:10,615 --> 01:18:16,365
<i>"This closeness has a distance. "</i>

1251
01:18:17,032 --> 01:18:22,656
<i>"There is loneliness in the air. "</i>

1252
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:28,947
<i>"The love we have, the trust... "</i>

1253
01:18:29,531 --> 01:18:35,448
<i>"Maybe it was love. "</i>

1254
01:18:36,032 --> 01:18:42,282
<i>"It was blossom. "</i>

1255
01:18:42,573 --> 01:18:46,032
<i>"Maybe it was love. "</i>

1256
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:54,698
<i>"Maybe it was love. "</i>

1257
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:11,603
For Meghna, I am the final word
Mr. Agarwal. Okay, bye.

1258
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:14,936
So many signatures, Anisha.
Is it necessary to read everything?

1259
01:21:15,353 --> 01:21:18,229
- Just go through it once.
- No way.

1260
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:21,271
No way. It's your agency's
contract. I trust you.

1261
01:21:21,437 --> 01:21:22,936
Where do I need to sign?

1262
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:27,937
Okay. On all these pages, initials.

1263
01:21:28,314 --> 01:21:31,938
- What?
- And here... full signature.

1264
01:21:33,315 --> 01:21:35,607
It is a tough task ahead for you.
I am warning you.

1265
01:21:35,815 --> 01:21:37,899
What's the point?
I am the best.

1266
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:39,274
And you know that.

1267
01:21:40,815 --> 01:21:41,900
- Hello.
- Hi.

1268
01:21:42,775 --> 01:21:45,691
- Oh hi. - Listen, I am sending you a car, come over immediately.

1269
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:46,816
Right now?

1270
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,442
- No questions do as I say.
- Okay.

1271
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:53,902
- Sarin?
- Yes.

1272
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:55,361
Sign it later.

1273
01:21:56,361 --> 01:21:57,443
Thanks.

1274
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:07,820
Come. Come...

1275
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:12,821
This way.

1276
01:22:20,365 --> 01:22:21,447
Come.

1277
01:22:23,782 --> 01:22:24,823
Surprise.

1278
01:22:30,699 --> 01:22:32,241
It's fabulous.

1279
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,991
I hope you like your new house.

1280
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:40,242
It's yours.

1281
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:43,493
I...

1282
01:22:49,328 --> 01:22:51,928
Mr. Sarin. I'll take it.

1283
01:22:58,578 --> 01:23:04,704
<i>"Abode. "</i>

1284
01:23:13,456 --> 01:23:17,998
<i>"Abode. "</i>

1285
01:23:28,334 --> 01:23:32,501
<i>"Abode. "</i>

1286
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:35,336
<i>"I have got it. "</i>

1287
01:23:36,001 --> 01:23:39,336
<i>"The goal of my destiny. "</i>

1288
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:42,878
<i>"Why are you common?"</i>

1289
01:23:43,379 --> 01:23:46,503
<i>"I have no complaints. "</i>

1290
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:53,339
<i>"A little intoxicated is my life. "</i>

1291
01:23:54,672 --> 01:24:01,382
<i>"A little intoxicated is my life. "</i>

1292
01:24:01,464 --> 01:24:05,258
<i>"This is my abode. "</i>

1293
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:08,840
<i>"It's my youth. "</i>

1294
01:24:08,923 --> 01:24:12,675
<i>"I have no time for myself. "</i>

1295
01:24:12,716 --> 01:24:16,342
<i>"I have no time for myself. "</i>

1296
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,898
You should come to the Gurudwara
occasionally, it feels good.

1297
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,441
- Gurpreet?
- Kuldeep?

1298
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:55,608
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

1299
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,817
- Greetings.
- Greetings, dear.

1300
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:02,568
What happened about the photographs
that Mrs. Sethi had sent?

1301
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,819
No aunty, I don't want to
get married right now.

1302
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,610
Don't want to get married?

1303
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:11,279
My daughter mentioned...

1304
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:14,695
that these fashion designers
don't get married.

1305
01:26:14,944 --> 01:26:16,027
Is it true?

1306
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:19,280
So are you also...

1307
01:26:20,945 --> 01:26:23,281
Aunt, these days, people
sayjust about anything.

1308
01:26:24,363 --> 01:26:26,613
How is Dolly, your elder daughter?

1309
01:26:27,363 --> 01:26:28,905
The one that got married in London.

1310
01:26:29,989 --> 01:26:31,614
I heard she is divorced...

1311
01:26:31,823 --> 01:26:33,489
... and now she's living with you.

1312
01:26:34,781 --> 01:26:35,824
Is it true?

1313
01:26:37,782 --> 01:26:39,283
Come on, let's go.

1314
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:45,783
You'll run out of answers
but their questions won't stop.

1315
01:26:47,033 --> 01:26:48,285
- Mom...
- Yes...

1316
01:26:48,367 --> 01:26:49,450
It's your life, your decision.

1317
01:26:49,992 --> 01:26:51,033
Mom?

1318
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:55,034
Rahul, I'm nervous.

1319
01:26:56,034 --> 01:26:59,287
I never thought I'd be the show
stopper for such a big show.

1320
01:27:00,703 --> 01:27:02,453
- And today thanks to you...
- Enough now.

1321
01:27:02,786 --> 01:27:04,828
Now don't get into your
teenage drama queen mode...

1322
01:27:05,036 --> 01:27:06,828
You very well know that you can do it...

1323
01:27:06,911 --> 01:27:07,953
... or you wouldn't have agreed.

1324
01:27:08,828 --> 01:27:11,037
Rahul... you know...

1325
01:27:11,829 --> 01:27:15,455
I agreed because
I can never say no to you.

1326
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,038
Thank you forthat.

1327
01:27:18,456 --> 01:27:22,456
- You look lovely. - Thank you. - Okay?
And you rock! - Thank you.

1328
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:25,457
Ria! How are you doing here?

1329
01:28:54,346 --> 01:28:57,680
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome Rahul Arora.

1330
01:28:57,804 --> 01:29:01,348
Who has brought us
the lovely brand La Perla!

1331
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,016
It was very funny.

1332
01:29:17,559 --> 01:29:19,392
- You're back.
- Yes.

1333
01:29:19,726 --> 01:29:21,726
So, what did you ask of Him?

1334
01:29:22,017 --> 01:29:24,060
I wasn't here to ask.
I came to thank Him.

1335
01:29:26,809 --> 01:29:29,852
Janet, yesterday, backstage
you told me something.

1336
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:31,603
Did you really mean it?

1337
01:29:32,394 --> 01:29:33,478
What?

1338
01:29:34,353 --> 01:29:36,811
That you can never say no to me.

1339
01:29:36,895 --> 01:29:38,936
Of course Rahul, you know that.

1340
01:29:43,355 --> 01:29:47,356
- Janet Sequeira.
- Yes. - Will you marry me?

1341
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:55,565
You are such an idiot.
I thought you were serious.

1342
01:29:55,607 --> 01:29:59,691
I am. I am serious.

1343
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:03,691
Janet, will you marry me?

1344
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:12,360
Listen, I don't know
whether it's right or wrong.

1345
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:14,901
But I do know this...

1346
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:16,611
... if anyone can understand me...

1347
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:19,402
... it's only you.

1348
01:30:24,362 --> 01:30:26,570
What about your boyfriend?

1349
01:30:28,696 --> 01:30:29,946
I have spoken to him.

1350
01:30:33,029 --> 01:30:34,821
When you can't come
out with the truth...

1351
01:30:35,947 --> 01:30:37,572
... it's time to live a lie.

1352
01:30:40,615 --> 01:30:42,948
There are a lot of people
who live like us.

1353
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:45,698
So shall we.

1354
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:49,366
And as they say...

1355
01:30:49,907 --> 01:30:53,367
it is difficult to find
a good friend in a husband.

1356
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:57,575
But you will surely find
a good husband in a good friend.

1357
01:31:01,784 --> 01:31:02,825
So?

1358
01:31:07,035 --> 01:31:08,077
You know my answer.

1359
01:31:13,036 --> 01:31:14,703
You know I can never say no to you.

1360
01:31:16,036 --> 01:31:18,704
Oh God, you scared me.

1361
01:31:28,372 --> 01:31:29,498
How sweet?

1362
01:31:31,914 --> 01:31:34,373
- See you. Let's go.
- Let's go. - Please, come.

1363
01:31:35,457 --> 01:31:37,915
- Hi Leena.
- Hi Leena. - Hi!

1364
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:40,708
- Hi Meghna.
- Hi, Mr. Sarin.

1365
01:31:40,832 --> 01:31:42,708
- Hello Meghna.
- Hi.

1366
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:45,708
So, everyone is talking about you.

1367
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,376
Don't worry, they're
saying good things.

1368
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:54,377
Abhi is taking good
care of you, isn't he?

1369
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:58,628
After all, you are
so important to Panache.

1370
01:32:00,794 --> 01:32:04,378
- Of course. Bye.
- Bye.

1371
01:32:04,462 --> 01:32:06,045
- See you, Meghna.
- Bye.

1372
01:32:06,379 --> 01:32:07,462
Bye.

1373
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:09,712
What was that?

1374
01:32:12,129 --> 01:32:13,380
That it. For you.

1375
01:32:21,381 --> 01:32:24,465
Attention. Attention, please.

1376
01:32:26,798 --> 01:32:27,965
Attention, please.

1377
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:31,383
Ladies and gentlemen,
attention, please.

1378
01:32:34,384 --> 01:32:37,133
I... I want to raise a toast.

1379
01:32:38,676 --> 01:32:40,385
Today is Rahul's wedding...

1380
01:32:41,134 --> 01:32:43,009
... and I'm very happy.

1381
01:32:46,718 --> 01:32:52,595
I want to congratulate Rahul
and his beautiful wife.

1382
01:32:52,679 --> 01:32:53,803
Thank you.

1383
01:32:54,803 --> 01:33:01,596
- Hi wife... wife...
- Janet.

1384
01:33:02,137 --> 01:33:05,514
Janet... Janet, right.

1385
01:33:07,138 --> 01:33:10,473
Janet is a beautiful girl
and Rahul is a great guy.

1386
01:33:10,557 --> 01:33:13,806
- Cheers, guys!
- Cheers!

1387
01:33:18,723 --> 01:33:20,723
Cheers!

1388
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:36,602
Kartik, this is the kind
of look I want, okay?

1389
01:33:37,394 --> 01:33:40,687
Vinay, you will get any look you want,
but please call your model.

1390
01:33:41,395 --> 01:33:42,811
Come on, guys. I am ready.

1391
01:33:42,936 --> 01:33:45,727
- Does anyone want to shoot or not?
- Yes, of course.

1392
01:33:46,937 --> 01:33:48,396
- Vinay.
- Yes.

1393
01:33:49,146 --> 01:33:51,479
I thought of holding
the drape like this.

1394
01:33:52,605 --> 01:33:55,397
I know you are very particular
about your drapes.

1395
01:33:55,938 --> 01:33:59,064
If you don't like it we can change it.

1396
01:33:59,148 --> 01:34:02,398
- No. It is absolutely fine. You are looking gorgeous.
- Thanks.

1397
01:34:02,481 --> 01:34:04,898
- Don't be silly.
- I thought so.

1398
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:08,731
What are you standing here for!

1399
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:11,066
- Go and get the next thing
ready duffer. - Sir... - Go!

1400
01:34:11,608 --> 01:34:13,150
Come on, Vinay, let's hurry up.

1401
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,941
It's been two hours and
we haven't taken a single shot.

1402
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,401
Meghna... darling are you ready?

1403
01:34:18,484 --> 01:34:20,025
Why are you getting
so hyper, Kartik?

1404
01:34:20,484 --> 01:34:22,485
Anyway, what do you have to do?

1405
01:34:23,152 --> 01:34:25,402
Except change the background colours.

1406
01:34:29,403 --> 01:34:32,819
Oh God. Just ignore her, okay?

1407
01:34:32,944 --> 01:34:34,612
Okay guys, come on guys.

1408
01:34:34,945 --> 01:34:36,154
Come on, let's get ready.

1409
01:34:40,028 --> 01:34:41,405
Anybody for some more drinks?

1410
01:34:41,904 --> 01:34:43,405
I think that's enough, baby.

1411
01:34:43,488 --> 01:34:44,530
- Really?
- Yes.

1412
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:58,699
- Shona... Do you love me?
- Yes.

1413
01:34:59,116 --> 01:35:01,616
- Yes, I love you.
- How much?

1414
01:35:01,907 --> 01:35:03,824
- A lot...
- Really?

1415
01:35:04,825 --> 01:35:05,950
She loves me.

1416
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,742
Drink this.

1417
01:35:10,618 --> 01:35:15,034
Come on, drink it.
Come on, Shona.

1418
01:35:15,493 --> 01:35:16,578
Are you joking?

1419
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:21,077
I am serious, Shona.
Come on. Come on.

1420
01:35:21,161 --> 01:35:22,953
- Listen... Come on.
- Please, pal.

1421
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:28,829
She loves me. Don't you, baby?
Come on now, drink it.

1422
01:35:28,912 --> 01:35:31,079
Don't be shy. Drink it.

1423
01:35:31,621 --> 01:35:34,414
Drink it, Shona. Come on. Drink it.

1424
01:35:36,039 --> 01:35:37,080
Get lost from here!

1425
01:35:45,956 --> 01:35:48,458
- Hey!
- Don't touch me, you fool!

1426
01:35:48,499 --> 01:35:51,082
- Stop being a lousy woman! I was joking!
- You were joking!

1427
01:35:51,165 --> 01:35:52,417
You insult me in front of your...

1428
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,042
... friends and then say you were joking.

1429
01:35:54,125 --> 01:35:55,166
You fool!

1430
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,750
Who funds your expenses?
Who pays all your bills?

1431
01:35:57,916 --> 01:35:59,084
Do yourfriends know about this?

1432
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:00,460
Have you told them?

1433
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:02,043
- Or should I tell them?
- Listen man!

1434
01:36:02,626 --> 01:36:05,835
You don't do me any favour
by funding my expenses.

1435
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:08,085
Who gets you your dope?

1436
01:36:08,586 --> 01:36:09,627
I do.

1437
01:36:09,835 --> 01:36:11,961
Who handles your craziness?

1438
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:13,753
I do!

1439
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:16,629
You are a crazy woman,
you know that?

1440
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:18,588
A crazy woman.

1441
01:36:18,962 --> 01:36:21,463
Don't call me crazy, you fool!

1442
01:36:21,837 --> 01:36:22,921
Get lost!

1443
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,468
What rubbish,
I don't need a Bollywood...

1444
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:49,051
... star when I have you, come on.

1445
01:36:49,468 --> 01:36:51,426
This is your place.
Make yourself comfortable here.

1446
01:36:51,509 --> 01:36:53,469
- Okay?
- Thanks Vinay.

1447
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:56,469
- And...
- Oh. - Who has done this?

1448
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:59,470
Sorry, dear. Yes, I've organized
some wine for you, I'll just check.

1449
01:36:59,511 --> 01:37:00,595
Yes? Alright, thanks.

1450
01:37:00,677 --> 01:37:03,470
Salim, leave everything right now
and attend to Meghna.

1451
01:37:03,511 --> 01:37:04,596
Come on, fast.

1452
01:37:04,678 --> 01:37:05,720
- Shonali... you first change.
- Yes.

1453
01:37:05,803 --> 01:37:06,845
- Kuki...
- Hi.

1454
01:37:07,678 --> 01:37:09,928
I told you I want more
options for earrings, right?

1455
01:37:10,513 --> 01:37:11,846
I won't wear such tacky earrings.

1456
01:37:11,929 --> 01:37:14,472
Meghna, everyone has the same look.

1457
01:37:14,513 --> 01:37:16,598
All the models are wearing
the same earrings.

1458
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:21,514
So... I am the show stopper tonight.

1459
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,015
- Make it happen...
- Fine.

1460
01:37:30,475 --> 01:37:32,516
Yes, thank you.

1461
01:38:38,235 --> 01:38:39,486
Move... move... please move aside.

1462
01:38:39,569 --> 01:38:41,694
Shonali is here, help her.
Please, get me a stole. Quickly.

1463
01:38:42,694 --> 01:38:44,487
Please, get me a stole, someone.

1464
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:47,071
Swati, will you please get me a stole?
Right now!

1465
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:50,029
Come Shonali, sit. Sit.

1466
01:38:50,071 --> 01:38:51,820
What's wrong with her?

1467
01:38:53,696 --> 01:38:57,072
Girls, will you please go
for yourfinale? Line up, please.

1468
01:38:57,154 --> 01:38:59,031
Calm down Shonali. Calm down.

1469
01:39:59,916 --> 01:40:02,165
Stop the media from coming inside!

1470
01:40:02,582 --> 01:40:03,624
Just relax.

1471
01:40:04,834 --> 01:40:06,625
- Oh God...
- Calm down, Shonali.

1472
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:08,583
Shonali, please. Just relax.

1473
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:12,084
It will be okay. Just calm down.

1474
01:40:19,044 --> 01:40:20,085
It has to be my rivals.

1475
01:40:20,168 --> 01:40:21,710
They are trying to sabotage my show.

1476
01:40:22,253 --> 01:40:23,711
This is not happening to me.

1477
01:40:24,128 --> 01:40:25,920
No. No. No media bites.

1478
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:28,505
No, please.

1479
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:31,505
I'm not in a frame of mind to comment.

1480
01:40:31,629 --> 01:40:33,505
Spare me the horror.

1481
01:40:33,587 --> 01:40:35,506
Please, no. No.

1482
01:40:35,588 --> 01:40:37,630
The media should
show some restraint.

1483
01:40:38,588 --> 01:40:40,048
Shonali is really disturbed.

1484
01:40:40,131 --> 01:40:41,507
No, I don't think Shonali Gujral...

1485
01:40:41,589 --> 01:40:43,507
... will do something like this for publicity.

1486
01:40:43,589 --> 01:40:46,049
It's very unfortunate,
but it is only an accident.

1487
01:40:46,132 --> 01:40:48,590
There is no need to hype it
and create an issue of it.

1488
01:40:48,632 --> 01:40:51,842
Down with fashion shows!
Don't ruin our culture!

1489
01:40:51,925 --> 01:40:53,842
As far as Vinay Khosla's
show is concerned...

1490
01:40:53,925 --> 01:40:57,591
whether this was an
accident or publicity stunt...

1491
01:40:57,633 --> 01:40:59,134
Only Shonali can confirm.

1492
01:40:59,592 --> 01:41:02,717
You havejust seen what
Meghna Mathur had to say.

1493
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:04,052
She herself is a model
the same Meghna Mathur,

1494
01:41:04,135 --> 01:41:06,511
who is the brand
ambassador of Panache.

1495
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:09,052
Could this be a personal conflict?
Or anything else?

1496
01:41:09,135 --> 01:41:11,512
Let's see again, what
Meghna Mathur has to say...

1497
01:41:11,594 --> 01:41:14,928
... about her rival Shonali Gujral.

1498
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:18,513
Whether this was an
accident or publicity stunt...

1499
01:41:18,637 --> 01:41:22,179
Only Shonali can confirm.

1500
01:41:22,263 --> 01:41:25,638
Only Shonali can confirm.

1501
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:36,608
Did you see the story about Shonali on TV?

1502
01:42:38,066 --> 01:42:41,609
Don't know for how long
she will have to stay there.

1503
01:42:42,192 --> 01:42:44,026
- Really sad.
- Yes.

1504
01:42:46,944 --> 01:42:49,527
Janet, have you given it a thought?

1505
01:42:51,027 --> 01:42:52,737
Rahul, I am still thinking.

1506
01:42:53,862 --> 01:42:56,695
To adopt a child considering our situation?

1507
01:42:57,278 --> 01:42:58,529
Janet, but...

1508
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:01,195
Yes, Rahul.
It's a huge responsibility.

1509
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:03,655
I promise, I'll think it over.

1510
01:43:05,739 --> 01:43:07,155
- Take your time.
- Yes.

1511
01:43:08,739 --> 01:43:09,823
How is Ashish doing?

1512
01:43:13,614 --> 01:43:14,656
Rocking.

1513
01:43:14,906 --> 01:43:16,073
He's gone off to Chennai...

1514
01:43:17,073 --> 01:43:19,198
- ... to do a show with Manish.
- Lovely.

1515
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:27,199
- Your drink.
- Thank you.

1516
01:43:32,576 --> 01:43:34,744
Why can't you come with me
on this three city tour?

1517
01:43:36,827 --> 01:43:39,243
Abhi, after all,
it is a Panache event.

1518
01:43:39,703 --> 01:43:40,953
I mean, we will be together too.

1519
01:43:41,036 --> 01:43:42,536
What's wrong with you, Meghna?

1520
01:43:43,619 --> 01:43:44,703
You know it is not possible.

1521
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:47,037
Where did this come from?

1522
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:53,038
There's something I want to tell you.

1523
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:55,163
Go on...

1524
01:43:58,623 --> 01:44:02,581
- I am pregnant.
- That's all.

1525
01:44:04,624 --> 01:44:06,957
Not to worry, it can be handled.

1526
01:44:14,625 --> 01:44:15,959
And what if I tell you...

1527
01:44:18,584 --> 01:44:19,709
... that I want to keep the baby.

1528
01:44:20,584 --> 01:44:23,209
Sure... I am okay with it.

1529
01:44:26,627 --> 01:44:27,711
I don't have a problem...

1530
01:44:28,836 --> 01:44:30,711
... but Anisha might have a problem.

1531
01:44:32,044 --> 01:44:33,545
You have signed a contract.

1532
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:41,755
Abhi, at times you are really funny.

1533
01:44:42,713 --> 01:44:43,755
I wasjust kidding...

1534
01:44:44,963 --> 01:44:46,714
... and you took it seriously.

1535
01:44:49,714 --> 01:44:51,715
I am a really successful model.

1536
01:44:53,924 --> 01:44:55,256
I won't ruin my career.

1537
01:45:00,925 --> 01:45:02,758
Come, I'll make you another drink.

1538
01:45:12,176 --> 01:45:14,927
Yes, my love.
I'm on my way home.

1539
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,928
No. I dined with the client.

1540
01:45:19,802 --> 01:45:20,928
Have the children slept?

1541
01:45:22,845 --> 01:45:24,720
Yes, see you soon.

1542
01:45:29,137 --> 01:45:31,596
Page 20, clause 22 A.

1543
01:45:32,638 --> 01:45:34,971
We will get twenty percent
of your earnings.

1544
01:45:37,305 --> 01:45:38,847
Clause 31 C.

1545
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:43,932
You can't do any endorsement
or make an appearance...

1546
01:45:43,972 --> 01:45:47,265
... without our permission.

1547
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:51,057
And finally Clause 36.

1548
01:45:51,808 --> 01:45:56,141
Officially you can
neither get married...

1549
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:59,726
... nor get pregnant.

1550
01:46:00,643 --> 01:46:01,975
Till the contract is valid.

1551
01:46:09,185 --> 01:46:11,977
You know what... I don't care!

1552
01:46:13,977 --> 01:46:15,186
Whom are you calling?

1553
01:46:16,854 --> 01:46:17,938
Sarin?

1554
01:46:18,938 --> 01:46:20,145
It is no use, my dear.

1555
01:46:20,938 --> 01:46:23,605
Sarin put in these clauses in
the contract himself.

1556
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:47,609
Are you okay?

1557
01:46:53,693 --> 01:46:55,984
I am fine.

1558
01:47:00,694 --> 01:47:06,070
I went back to being a middle
class girl for a while.

1559
01:47:12,822 --> 01:47:13,863
But I am fine.

1560
01:47:17,072 --> 01:47:18,155
I am fine.

1561
01:47:25,281 --> 01:47:26,615
I am fine.

1562
01:48:32,835 --> 01:48:34,877
Whose pregnancy do you
want to get terminated?

1563
01:48:35,378 --> 01:48:36,627
Mine.

1564
01:48:36,710 --> 01:48:38,210
- Are you married? Okay.
- No.

1565
01:48:39,169 --> 01:48:42,169
- Just fill up this form.
- Can I borrow your pen?

1566
01:49:09,758 --> 01:49:11,258
Stop! Stop!

1567
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:17,175
Madam, you are driving
without the seat belt.

1568
01:49:17,967 --> 01:49:19,050
License?

1569
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:24,218
Listen, I don't have much time, so...

1570
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:25,635
Alright. Take the car aside.

1571
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,302
Sir, license.

1572
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,094
Surekha, take the test.

1573
01:49:34,721 --> 01:49:36,178
I am not going to take that dirty test, okay?

1574
01:49:36,262 --> 01:49:37,762
Who knows how many people
have put it in their mouth.

1575
01:49:37,846 --> 01:49:38,887
Listen madam.

1576
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:41,847
It doesn't matter whether you are
a model, an actor or anybody else...

1577
01:49:42,096 --> 01:49:43,179
I don't care.

1578
01:49:43,722 --> 01:49:45,305
Surekha, take the test.

1579
01:50:00,725 --> 01:50:04,726
Our daughter has done us proud.

1580
01:50:04,809 --> 01:50:07,642
The one who climbed
the stairs of success so soon.

1581
01:50:07,726 --> 01:50:08,767
Why are you crying?

1582
01:50:08,851 --> 01:50:12,727
Look, your daughter is now a super model.

1583
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:19,644
Now our neighbours will come
with flowers, to a proud mother.

1584
01:50:22,854 --> 01:50:26,812
Meghna, your reckless behaviour is
not only damaging your reputation...

1585
01:50:27,062 --> 01:50:28,646
... but Panache's too.

1586
01:50:29,646 --> 01:50:30,771
I know you are upset.

1587
01:50:31,187 --> 01:50:34,772
But learn to keep your personal life
apart from your professional life.

1588
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:40,064
Really?

1589
01:50:43,148 --> 01:50:44,189
Tell me something, Abhi.

1590
01:50:45,982 --> 01:50:47,065
What about our relationship...

1591
01:50:49,733 --> 01:50:51,150
... is it personal or professional?

1592
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:01,276
Don't worry.
You don't have to answer that.

1593
01:51:05,819 --> 01:51:07,985
It is time to get truly
professional Mr. Sarin.

1594
01:51:34,741 --> 01:51:38,657
- Yes... - Had you been to his last season?
- No, I haven't, but I...

1595
01:51:38,741 --> 01:51:40,658
I am telling you, the food should...

1596
01:51:40,742 --> 01:51:43,325
- No thank you.
- Yes, she is very charming.

1597
01:51:43,408 --> 01:51:45,659
- I will.
- Cheers.

1598
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:48,867
That's not fair.

1599
01:51:49,366 --> 01:51:51,660
- Lovely!
- Exactly.

1600
01:51:51,744 --> 01:51:53,702
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- Sure.

1601
01:51:53,744 --> 01:51:56,994
How I managed to put this show together.

1602
01:51:57,077 --> 01:52:00,077
- It was hell...
- Whatever, third big launch of the year.

1603
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:01,202
Thank you very much.

1604
01:52:01,286 --> 01:52:02,828
- Tony...
- Hi.

1605
01:52:04,829 --> 01:52:05,870
Congratulations.

1606
01:52:05,953 --> 01:52:07,369
I am so sorry I came late.

1607
01:52:07,412 --> 01:52:08,954
No, it's alright. You made it at least.

1608
01:52:09,038 --> 01:52:10,663
- Cheers.
- Bye.

1609
01:52:10,747 --> 01:52:11,830
- Excuse me.
- Yes. - See you.

1610
01:52:11,871 --> 01:52:12,954
Johnny, hi.

1611
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:18,831
- Hi Meghna.
- Abhi...

1612
01:52:21,749 --> 01:52:23,956
I think you have taken
my words too seriously.

1613
01:52:24,956 --> 01:52:26,665
You have become so professional...

1614
01:52:26,749 --> 01:52:27,999
... that you are uneasy greeting me.

1615
01:52:28,082 --> 01:52:30,666
Behave yourself. You are drunk.

1616
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:31,833
I am drunk?

1617
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:42,168
- Hello, Meghna.
- Mrs. Sarin.

1618
01:52:42,959 --> 01:52:44,293
So, how are you now?

1619
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,294
I saw all that drama on television.

1620
01:52:47,376 --> 01:52:50,294
What happened?
You look so stressed out.

1621
01:52:53,712 --> 01:52:54,836
Didn't you tell her?

1622
01:52:56,712 --> 01:53:00,337
Actually, I wasn't well.
I was in a clinic.

1623
01:53:02,171 --> 01:53:03,297
I had an abortion.

1624
01:53:07,297 --> 01:53:09,298
Abhi will give you the details.

1625
01:53:11,715 --> 01:53:14,048
After all... he paid the bills.

1626
01:53:23,717 --> 01:53:25,841
Oh! She got offended.

1627
01:53:37,719 --> 01:53:39,678
I'm telling you again Meghna,
it's still not too late.

1628
01:53:40,261 --> 01:53:42,303
Avantika is very upset...

1629
01:53:42,762 --> 01:53:44,094
... but I think we can handle it.

1630
01:53:44,929 --> 01:53:47,763
Just meet her once and apologise.

1631
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:50,221
If she forgives you,
everything will be sorted.

1632
01:53:50,304 --> 01:53:51,387
I should apologise to her?

1633
01:53:52,846 --> 01:53:53,888
Are you kidding me?

1634
01:53:55,764 --> 01:53:57,264
Who is she, Anisha?

1635
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:00,765
Just some lousy trophy wife...

1636
01:54:02,766 --> 01:54:03,890
I don't need her.

1637
01:54:04,724 --> 01:54:07,724
Of course, you need her, Meghna.

1638
01:54:08,306 --> 01:54:10,767
You're in this position due to Panache.

1639
01:54:10,849 --> 01:54:14,058
You are signing brands courtesy of Panache.
You need them!

1640
01:54:14,099 --> 01:54:15,308
Wrong, Anisha.

1641
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:19,267
I am the freaking face of Panache.

1642
01:54:21,309 --> 01:54:25,851
I don't need Panache,
Panache needs me. Okay?

1643
01:54:31,977 --> 01:54:33,062
Anything else?

1644
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:10,984
- Yes.
- What the hell is going on, Anisha?

1645
01:55:11,485 --> 01:55:13,735
- Where the hell have you been?
- Shut up!

1646
01:55:13,943 --> 01:55:14,985
I just read the paper.

1647
01:55:15,985 --> 01:55:17,069
Come on, Meghna.

1648
01:55:17,486 --> 01:55:18,860
This had to happen.

1649
01:55:19,152 --> 01:55:20,402
I told you so.

1650
01:55:20,945 --> 01:55:22,195
Oh, cut the crap, Anisha.

1651
01:55:22,945 --> 01:55:24,861
Gauri Anand is from your agency.

1652
01:55:24,945 --> 01:55:27,780
I've been replaced.

1653
01:55:28,488 --> 01:55:29,738
Don't be such a lousy woman.

1654
01:55:29,821 --> 01:55:31,862
There's no need to get personal, Meghna.

1655
01:55:32,071 --> 01:55:34,863
Personal? I can't believe you did this to me.

1656
01:55:35,988 --> 01:55:37,405
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1657
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:42,322
When we replaced Shonali...

1658
01:55:42,948 --> 01:55:44,741
... you didn't ask me this.

1659
01:55:45,824 --> 01:55:46,865
I really think you should...

1660
01:56:01,867 --> 01:56:03,744
The sound of a shattered
dream never hurts...

1661
01:56:03,827 --> 01:56:05,785
... as much as it's lasting echo.

1662
01:56:06,952 --> 01:56:09,745
My career started falling
like a pack of cards...

1663
01:56:09,828 --> 01:56:11,869
... and I stood there,
a mere spectator.

1664
01:56:12,411 --> 01:56:14,746
Everything changed...
home, relationships...

1665
01:56:14,829 --> 01:56:16,286
... and along with them I changed too.

1666
01:56:17,204 --> 01:56:19,787
Commitment, sincerity, professionalism...

1667
01:56:20,328 --> 01:56:23,163
I ran away from all of them...

1668
01:56:23,205 --> 01:56:26,748
... and reached a place so loud...

1669
01:56:26,831 --> 01:56:29,789
... that I couldn't even hear myself.

1670
01:56:31,164 --> 01:56:35,873
What I was doing, why I was doing it...
I had no clue at all.

1671
01:56:36,957 --> 01:56:41,332
Shonali was right,
I couldn't even recognize myself.

1672
01:56:49,834 --> 01:56:50,918
Go easy, Meghna.

1673
01:56:51,252 --> 01:56:52,752
You've had a lot to drink.

1674
01:56:54,252 --> 01:56:55,752
You're saying that, Janet!

1675
01:56:58,877 --> 01:57:01,086
Look, I don't know how to lecture.

1676
01:57:01,419 --> 01:57:04,336
But I can say this much,
you're ruining yourself.

1677
01:57:04,753 --> 01:57:05,837
You are right.

1678
01:57:05,878 --> 01:57:09,171
You don't know how to lecture,
so please don't try.

1679
01:57:10,838 --> 01:57:14,755
Meghna, everyone I meet is
talking about your arrogance.

1680
01:57:15,964 --> 01:57:18,422
It is not arrogance,
baby. It is attitude.

1681
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,423
It's important to have an
attitude to be successful.

1682
01:57:21,507 --> 01:57:22,881
- Okay?
- Oh, really?

1683
01:57:23,048 --> 01:57:24,840
What about unprofessionalism?

1684
01:57:25,215 --> 01:57:27,049
Is that necessary too?

1685
01:57:28,924 --> 01:57:30,424
Listen, if you continue to...

1686
01:57:30,508 --> 01:57:32,008
... behave like this no one
will want to work with you.

1687
01:57:33,383 --> 01:57:34,758
Unprofessional?

1688
01:57:37,509 --> 01:57:40,759
Did you just call me
unprofessional, Janet?

1689
01:57:42,843 --> 01:57:45,052
What do you know
about professionalism?

1690
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:50,177
You don't become a model by doing
a couple of small assignments.

1691
01:57:53,761 --> 01:57:57,429
Listen... I know I didn't make it big.

1692
01:57:57,762 --> 01:58:00,971
But I have spent more time in this industry.

1693
01:58:03,222 --> 01:58:06,346
I know why your reputation is getting ruined.

1694
01:58:07,097 --> 01:58:08,764
That's why I'm telling you...

1695
01:58:08,848 --> 01:58:11,098
... straighten up before everything crumbles.

1696
01:58:15,099 --> 01:58:16,182
Straighten up?

1697
01:58:17,765 --> 01:58:18,849
How?

1698
01:58:20,265 --> 01:58:22,766
Should I beg Sarin or Anisha?

1699
01:58:25,183 --> 01:58:26,892
I know what I can do.

1700
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:31,851
I should marry a rich gay designer like you.

1701
01:58:33,144 --> 01:58:34,185
How about that?

1702
01:58:36,477 --> 01:58:40,853
Leave. Just leave.

1703
01:59:01,106 --> 01:59:03,398
- Hey.
- Hi babes. Where are you?

1704
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,773
We all are waiting for you.

1705
01:59:04,857 --> 01:59:06,107
Come to Dhiren's party fast now.

1706
01:59:06,190 --> 01:59:08,107
Yes, I'll be there.

1707
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:09,774
- Give me 20 minutes.
- Okay.

1708
01:59:11,108 --> 01:59:15,942
<i>"Charm. "</i>

1709
01:59:19,775 --> 01:59:24,860
<i>"Charm. "</i>

1710
01:59:27,277 --> 01:59:31,402
<i>"It's the charm of the body. "</i>

1711
01:59:31,444 --> 01:59:33,778
<i>"It's the charm of the body. "</i>

1712
01:59:33,862 --> 01:59:35,987
<i>"It's the ladder to success. "</i>

1713
01:59:40,446 --> 01:59:42,279
<i>"Charm. "</i>

1714
01:59:42,779 --> 01:59:46,864
<i>"It's the charm of fashion. "</i>

1715
01:59:46,947 --> 01:59:53,448
<i>"It's intoxicating. "</i>

1716
01:59:54,781 --> 02:00:03,200

1718
02:00:10,951 --> 02:00:17,452
<i>"Charm. "</i>

1719
02:00:17,536 --> 02:00:21,786
<i>"Charm. It's the charm of fashion. "</i>

1720
02:00:21,870 --> 02:00:25,995

1721
02:00:26,078 --> 02:00:30,245

02:01:27,048 --> 02:01:31,089

1727
02:01:31,839 --> 02:01:35,882

1730
02:01:44,884 --> 02:01:49,009
<i>"Charm. "</i>

1731
02:06:36,307 --> 02:06:37,390
Meghna...

1732
02:06:43,474 --> 02:06:44,517
Dear...

1733
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,854
We become totally isolated...

1734
02:07:04,937 --> 02:07:07,604
... when we lose our own company.

1735
02:07:09,188 --> 02:07:10,855
I came back home to Chandigarh...

1736
02:07:10,938 --> 02:07:13,479
... but I could never be myself.

1737
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:16,981
Leaving all my relationships behind...

1738
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:19,940
I descended into my inner darkness.

1739
02:07:21,315 --> 02:07:24,356
I neither felt happy nor sad.

1740
02:07:29,357 --> 02:07:31,859
The psychiatrist advised...

1741
02:07:31,942 --> 02:07:34,859
... that nothing is possible until...

1742
02:07:34,942 --> 02:07:40,860
I rediscover myself and
my inner self confidence.

1743
02:07:42,526 --> 02:07:45,861
But as easy as it is to lose oneself...

1744
02:07:45,944 --> 02:07:48,861
... it is even more difficult to forgive oneself...

1745
02:07:48,944 --> 02:07:51,945
... to find oneself again.

1746
02:07:54,195 --> 02:07:55,946
Have you heard anything about Shonali?

1747
02:07:57,529 --> 02:07:59,446
I heard that she's run away from rehab.

1748
02:08:00,863 --> 02:08:01,989
No one knows her whereabouts.

1749
02:08:02,864 --> 02:08:05,031
Yes, that's really sad.

1750
02:08:10,032 --> 02:08:11,114
Hey Rahul.

1751
02:08:11,865 --> 02:08:14,073
Who is your show stopper for the Delhi show?

1752
02:08:14,532 --> 02:08:18,365
I heard thatjust like Vinay Khosla,
you too have roped in a film star.

1753
02:08:18,866 --> 02:08:21,366
No, no. I like film stars.

1754
02:08:21,408 --> 02:08:23,867
But if there was a model...

1755
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:28,201
- ... for a show stopper for this show... that's best.
- Yes.

1756
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:31,284
You know I... really miss a good model.

1757
02:08:33,243 --> 02:08:35,534
- Like Shonali...
- And, Meghna.

1758
02:09:18,125 --> 02:09:19,209
Meghna.

1759
02:09:24,585 --> 02:09:25,628
Dear...

1760
02:09:27,586 --> 02:09:28,920
... the one who loses...

1761
02:09:28,961 --> 02:09:31,543
... isn't the one who falls.

1762
02:09:33,587 --> 02:09:34,921
But a failure is one...

1763
02:09:34,962 --> 02:09:37,295
... who still doesn't rise to the occasion.

1764
02:09:39,088 --> 02:09:41,922
My daughter is not a loser.

1765
02:09:44,964 --> 02:09:46,089
I'm sorry, my dear.

1766
02:09:50,131 --> 02:09:52,924
It was my fault that I...

1767
02:09:52,965 --> 02:09:56,925
... didn't trust my daughter's dream...

1768
02:09:56,966 --> 02:10:00,257
- ... and how high it could take her.
- Papa...

1769
02:10:03,926 --> 02:10:05,884
I had trust in my daughter...

1770
02:10:05,967 --> 02:10:07,175
... and I still do.

1771
02:10:10,635 --> 02:10:15,094
Go ahead, pursue your dream again.

1772
02:10:16,969 --> 02:10:18,052
Yes, my dear.

1773
02:10:24,095 --> 02:10:25,220
Go back, my dear.

1774
02:10:27,429 --> 02:10:28,596
You will achieve success.

1775
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:34,263
Yes, dear.

1776
02:10:36,972 --> 02:10:38,973
Go dear, go back.

1777
02:11:11,186 --> 02:11:13,979
Thought I'd come and apologise.

1778
02:11:17,938 --> 02:11:19,145
But I can't.

1779
02:11:26,356 --> 02:11:29,022
Look Janet, I know I really hurt you.

1780
02:11:31,398 --> 02:11:32,440
I was wrong.

1781
02:11:35,399 --> 02:11:38,400
But when I decided to come back...

1782
02:11:39,983 --> 02:11:42,108
I couldn't think of anyone else but you.

1783
02:11:47,025 --> 02:11:48,192
So, I came right here.

1784
02:11:54,694 --> 02:11:56,111
I did the right thing, didn't I, Janet?

1785
02:12:05,528 --> 02:12:06,612
Welcome back.

1786
02:12:09,529 --> 02:12:10,613
I am so sorry.

1787
02:12:16,948 --> 02:12:20,990
So, you know what... I've now
specifically told all the actors...

1788
02:12:21,448 --> 02:12:24,657
You may borrow clothes for
a function, but do return them.

1789
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:26,324
Yes, you know theyjust...

1790
02:12:27,950 --> 02:12:28,991
Typical.

1791
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:35,242
Oh my God. Oh my God... listen, listen.

1792
02:12:36,659 --> 02:12:37,951
Guess, who is back in town.

1793
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:40,993
Meghna Mathur.

1794
02:12:43,952 --> 02:12:45,994
- Wow...
- Back from the dead or what?

1795
02:12:47,035 --> 02:12:50,662
Hi Vinay, I am back in town.
I would like to meet you.

1796
02:12:51,161 --> 02:12:52,662
Please, let me know
when I can call you.

1797
02:12:53,953 --> 02:12:55,996
Spare me the horror.

1798
02:12:56,288 --> 02:12:57,954
Who wants to speak to her?

1799
02:13:03,122 --> 02:13:04,538
- Guess what?
- What?

1800
02:13:05,122 --> 02:13:06,163
Same message.

1801
02:13:07,205 --> 02:13:09,039
She's sent it to everyone.

1802
02:13:09,081 --> 02:13:11,455
- Desperate.
- I tell you.

1803
02:13:16,624 --> 02:13:19,040
You know, she always
compared herself to Shonali.

1804
02:13:20,292 --> 02:13:22,457
Mark my words, someday
she will lose it, just like Shonali.

1805
02:14:11,091 --> 02:14:16,009
- Bye... - Bye. I'll see you.
- Yes. - For dinner? - Yes.

1806
02:14:17,592 --> 02:14:19,551
- Manav, that was excellent.
- Thank you.

1807
02:14:19,635 --> 02:14:20,968
- We need a close up.
- Okay.

1808
02:14:21,051 --> 02:14:22,467
- Go to the rest room.
- Alright.

1809
02:14:22,551 --> 02:14:24,593
- Well, be back in half an hour.
- Sure. - Mahesh!

1810
02:14:24,677 --> 02:14:25,969
Set up a trolley.
Make it fast, come on.

1811
02:14:41,554 --> 02:14:43,264
You went through a lot in your life...

1812
02:14:47,347 --> 02:14:49,014
... but the good thing is
that you have come back.

1813
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:56,308
Listen... don't worry.
Everything is going to be okay.

1814
02:14:58,057 --> 02:15:00,141
I am sorry, Manav.

1815
02:15:04,433 --> 02:15:06,392
I know I've hurt you a lot.

1816
02:15:08,476 --> 02:15:09,559
It's okay.

1817
02:15:10,268 --> 02:15:14,728
I'm really happy for you,
today you're in the big league.

1818
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:17,560
- I am really happy...
- Well, hardly.

1819
02:15:17,644 --> 02:15:20,561
- Hi baby.
- Oh, hi.

1820
02:15:20,645 --> 02:15:21,978
Am I disturbing you?

1821
02:15:22,061 --> 02:15:23,395
No, no. Come in. That's fine.

1822
02:15:25,437 --> 02:15:27,979
- Meghna, that's Ria.
- Ria, that's Meghna.

1823
02:15:28,062 --> 02:15:29,104
- Hi... Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1824
02:15:29,188 --> 02:15:30,395
She is my fiancée.

1825
02:15:34,147 --> 02:15:35,480
We just got engaged last month.

1826
02:15:35,563 --> 02:15:38,273
I heard a lot about you.
Nice to meet you.

1827
02:15:39,273 --> 02:15:42,606
Thank you. I... I should go.

1828
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:44,398
- No, no. Please...
- No, really.

1829
02:15:44,482 --> 02:15:45,523
Please stay for a while.

1830
02:15:46,149 --> 02:15:47,191
Some other time.

1831
02:15:47,274 --> 02:15:51,483
- Okay? Congratulations.
- Thanks. - Thanks.

1832
02:16:22,988 --> 02:16:26,989
It is said, the people you meet
on your way up to success...

1833
02:16:27,073 --> 02:16:31,073
... you encounter them again
on your way down.

1834
02:16:34,157 --> 02:16:36,074
It felt really weird.

1835
02:16:38,658 --> 02:16:42,991
The relations I left behind in
arrogance of my success...

1836
02:16:43,075 --> 02:16:48,117
... have left me and gone way ahead in life.

1837
02:16:49,369 --> 02:16:50,660
Everything had changed.

1838
02:16:52,576 --> 02:16:55,994
But thank God...
some relationships in life...

1839
02:16:56,078 --> 02:16:59,745
don't require an invitation for acceptance.

1840
02:17:04,162 --> 02:17:07,080
And this is going to be
your outfit for the show.

1841
02:17:07,246 --> 02:17:08,330
- Nice?
- Nice.

1842
02:17:09,038 --> 02:17:11,080
It's beautiful.

1843
02:17:13,538 --> 02:17:18,455
- Rohit... thank you.
- For what?

1844
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,290
For giving me this opportunity.

1845
02:17:24,373 --> 02:17:26,166
I know that you didn't have to do it.

1846
02:17:28,667 --> 02:17:31,416
And everyone must have
advised you not to.

1847
02:17:32,042 --> 02:17:35,416
Who cares...
No one knows you like I do.

1848
02:17:35,709 --> 02:17:39,168
Look, if I could have my way,
you would be my show stopper.

1849
02:17:40,417 --> 02:17:44,002
But Meghna... the sponsors...
you know how it is.

1850
02:17:44,086 --> 02:17:46,086
I know... Rohit I know.

1851
02:17:47,336 --> 02:17:50,128
The fact that I'm even in
your show, means a lot.

1852
02:17:54,087 --> 02:17:58,129
After all, it is my first show
on comeback and...

1853
02:17:58,213 --> 02:18:02,546
Trust me... you are going to rock. Okay?

1854
02:18:18,423 --> 02:18:19,759
Hey, are you nervous.

1855
02:18:21,508 --> 02:18:22,759
Don't worry... want to drink?

1856
02:18:24,175 --> 02:18:25,218
No thanks.

1857
02:18:34,761 --> 02:18:37,511
<i>"Some distance is...</i>

1858
02:18:37,636 --> 02:18:39,762

1859
02:18:40,261 --> 02:18:41,303

1860
02:18:41,511 --> 02:18:42,762
<i>"Is it trust?"</i>

1861
02:18:45,637 --> 02:18:47,304
- Meghna...
- Hi.

1862
02:18:47,512 --> 02:18:48,553
Meghna, are you okay?

1863
02:18:48,637 --> 02:18:49,722
Yes, of course.

1864
02:18:49,764 --> 02:18:52,554
Look, don't worry.
You'll be absolutely fine. Okay?

1865
02:18:52,722 --> 02:18:53,764
Are you sure?

1866
02:18:54,055 --> 02:18:55,098
You are looking gorgeous.

1867
02:18:55,265 --> 02:18:57,430
- Sir.
- Yes... - Thanks.

1868
02:18:57,639 --> 02:19:00,181
Look, the show stopper has come.
I'll be back in a minute.

1869
02:19:00,306 --> 02:19:01,390
- Okay?
- Bye.

1870
02:19:03,724 --> 02:19:08,432
Hi, Fabiana. You just tell me,
my assistants are there to help you.

1871
02:19:08,599 --> 02:19:10,767
And let's go to the lounge,
yes. Okay, come.

1872
02:19:14,392 --> 02:19:18,059
Guess what? I had no clue
and I walked in and then...

1873
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:19,185
... i was...

1874
02:19:19,518 --> 02:19:21,102
Okay girls, let's stand in order.

1875
02:19:21,310 --> 02:19:24,185
Meghna, you are not here.
You are after Brinal.

1876
02:19:24,269 --> 02:19:25,602
- Brinal, stand here...
- I am sorry.

1877
02:19:25,644 --> 02:19:26,728
Meghna... Sucheta...

1878
02:20:35,321 --> 02:20:36,405
Move... move.

1879
02:20:39,823 --> 02:20:42,614
<i>"Something special. "</i>

1880
02:20:55,159 --> 02:20:57,118
Okay, listen.
Meena is the next girl, right?

1881
02:20:57,285 --> 02:20:59,785
Okay, tell her to come on the head
ramp and take Meghna away.

1882
02:21:21,663 --> 02:21:23,788
Listen, this is second
change for Meghna.

1883
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:25,539
Just leave her,
I'll handle her.

1884
02:21:25,664 --> 02:21:27,789
Okay, just do the same.
I'll handle her.

1885
02:21:29,664 --> 02:21:32,124
Meghna, just relax, okay?

1886
02:21:32,498 --> 02:21:34,832
Meghna, just relax.

1887
02:21:59,170 --> 02:22:01,336
Meghna, it is alright. It happens.

1888
02:22:01,713 --> 02:22:02,754
It's alright?

1889
02:22:04,087 --> 02:22:05,837
I ruined everything, Janet.

1890
02:22:07,838 --> 02:22:09,629
I froze on the head ramp.

1891
02:22:09,714 --> 02:22:11,671
Do you even understand
what it means?

1892
02:22:11,838 --> 02:22:13,173
That means nothing at all.

1893
02:22:14,173 --> 02:22:15,338
It happens sometimes.

1894
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:18,672
It doesn't happen, Rahul.

1895
02:22:22,758 --> 02:22:27,340
I don't think I have
it in me anymore.

1896
02:22:28,382 --> 02:22:29,507
Oh, come on, Meghna.

1897
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:31,092
You were nervous then, that's all.

1898
02:22:31,633 --> 02:22:33,550
I mean, you walked
the ramp after a year.

1899
02:22:33,842 --> 02:22:37,342
Meghnajust think,
how will your dad feel?

1900
02:22:41,384 --> 02:22:45,844
Meghna, relax...
you have to be very strong.

1901
02:22:46,761 --> 02:22:48,510
You have to believe in yourself.

1902
02:22:50,721 --> 02:22:52,095
You know how this industry works.

1903
02:22:52,762 --> 02:22:55,722
There is no room for weakness.

1904
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,554
Alright.

1905
02:23:11,389 --> 02:23:13,849
- Listen... isn't that Shonali?
- The model?

1906
02:23:14,224 --> 02:23:15,307
Just see.

1907
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:17,099
Isn't that Shonali the model?

1908
02:23:18,515 --> 02:23:20,516
- How long have you been here?
- Shut up.

1909
02:23:20,726 --> 02:23:22,142
- Madam.
- Shut up!

1910
02:23:22,225 --> 02:23:23,308
Go away!

1911
02:23:23,391 --> 02:23:25,727
Madam, do you know anyone here?

1912
02:23:26,185 --> 02:23:27,226
Madam, please tell us.
Do you know anyone here.

1913
02:23:35,643 --> 02:23:38,103
People say that she has
been here for the last two days...

1914
02:23:38,187 --> 02:23:39,853
and isn't talking to anyone.

1915
02:23:40,103 --> 02:23:42,103
Shonali Gujral's distressing story...

1916
02:23:42,187 --> 02:23:45,520
highlights another truth
of the fashion industry.

1917
02:23:45,604 --> 02:23:46,645
It is evident...

1918
02:23:46,730 --> 02:23:49,521
that the profession isn't
as glamorous as it seems.

1919
02:23:49,731 --> 02:23:51,105
With cameraman Mahesh Pakhare...

1920
02:23:51,189 --> 02:23:53,855
... this is Umesh Kumawat
for Star News, Mumbai.

1921
02:24:07,399 --> 02:24:08,524
Listen, Inspector...

1922
02:24:08,733 --> 02:24:10,108
... instead of roaming
on the streets...

1923
02:24:10,399 --> 02:24:13,109
... instead of making a mockery
in front of the media...

1924
02:24:13,193 --> 02:24:14,859
... it is better that
we take her along.

1925
02:24:15,275 --> 02:24:17,650
Our NGO will
take good care of her.

1926
02:24:17,859 --> 02:24:19,152
Madam, it's a procedure.

1927
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:21,110
Until her family members don't come...

1928
02:24:21,194 --> 02:24:22,860
And don't take her along or...

1929
02:24:23,735 --> 02:24:24,861
... she doesn't say anything.

1930
02:24:25,444 --> 02:24:27,319
We can't let you take her.

1931
02:24:36,196 --> 02:24:37,863
Madam, do you know her?

1932
02:24:40,404 --> 02:24:41,446
Yes, I do.

1933
02:24:53,865 --> 02:24:56,741
Meghna, it's a huge responsibility.

1934
02:24:57,616 --> 02:24:58,866
You yourself are struggling.

1935
02:24:59,532 --> 02:25:01,742
Can you afford to look
after her as well?

1936
02:25:05,742 --> 02:25:08,743
I haven't thought about it, Janet.

1937
02:25:11,493 --> 02:25:12,535
All I know is...

1938
02:25:14,535 --> 02:25:15,869
I'm not doing it for Shonali...

1939
02:25:17,619 --> 02:25:18,662
... but for myself.

1940
02:25:22,536 --> 02:25:23,870
I really need to do this.

1941
02:25:32,330 --> 02:25:33,413
Okay.

1942
02:25:44,874 --> 02:25:49,125
After bringing Shonali
home I realized...

1943
02:25:49,208 --> 02:25:51,875
... that our lives were quite similar.

1944
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:55,417
Both of us had lost ourselves.

1945
02:25:57,292 --> 02:25:59,168
The happiness I achieved in helping...

1946
02:25:59,209 --> 02:26:01,169
... Shonali come back to a normal life...

1947
02:26:01,210 --> 02:26:05,669
was more important than the happiness
of professional success.

1948
02:26:07,336 --> 02:26:13,879
As she got better, I regained
the self confidence I had lost.

1949
02:26:40,550 --> 02:26:42,551
Listen, listen.
Breaking news.

1950
02:26:42,759 --> 02:26:46,884
My darling Rahul has bagged
the finale at the fashion week.

1951
02:26:47,634 --> 02:26:49,426
- Cheers.
- That's fantastic.

1952
02:26:49,510 --> 02:26:51,177
- Wow, Rahul. That's fantastic.
- Cheers.

1953
02:26:51,301 --> 02:26:53,343
- The biggest show ever.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1954
02:26:53,426 --> 02:26:54,886
In fact everything was
finalised yesterday.

1955
02:26:55,177 --> 02:26:58,886
Tie a line of top models
and a surprise show stopper.

1956
02:26:59,302 --> 02:27:00,345
Who is the show stopper?

1957
02:27:00,512 --> 02:27:01,762
Like Vinay Khosla's...

1958
02:27:02,178 --> 02:27:06,137
Rohit... you know in fact
she is the best right now.

1959
02:27:08,763 --> 02:27:10,304
Ms. Meghna Mathur.

1960
02:27:10,888 --> 02:27:13,430
Surprise!

1961
02:27:14,556 --> 02:27:15,639
Yeah.

1962
02:27:16,889 --> 02:27:21,306
Guys, I don't think that's
a good idea. I mean...

1963
02:27:23,306 --> 02:27:24,891
After what happened
at Rohit's show...

1964
02:27:25,391 --> 02:27:27,891
I don't think that's a good idea.

1965
02:27:28,182 --> 02:27:30,892
We've given this
a lot of thought.

1966
02:27:35,642 --> 02:27:39,560
I know you'll are doing this for me.

1967
02:27:40,309 --> 02:27:43,185
I mean, I really appreciate it.
I do, I am really grateful, but.

1968
02:27:44,644 --> 02:27:46,769
But... I... can't do your show Rahul.

1969
02:27:47,227 --> 02:27:50,436
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1970
02:27:56,563 --> 02:27:58,229
Why don't you want to do the show?

1971
02:27:58,646 --> 02:27:59,771
Please.

1972
02:28:00,772 --> 02:28:04,564
You do know how important
this show is for you, don't you?

1973
02:28:05,772 --> 02:28:06,898
Come on, Shonali.

1974
02:28:07,857 --> 02:28:09,898
You do know what happened
during Rohit's show?

1975
02:28:13,774 --> 02:28:15,440
This show is very
important for Rahul.

1976
02:28:19,233 --> 02:28:21,775
I can't let the same thing
happen to him too, you know.

1977
02:28:24,776 --> 02:28:27,192
Meghna, you aren't
worried for Rahul...

1978
02:28:27,234 --> 02:28:28,901
... but you're afraid of failing again.

1979
02:28:31,902 --> 02:28:34,193
Rahul has so much confidence in you...

1980
02:28:34,235 --> 02:28:36,193
... isn't it fair...

1981
02:28:36,278 --> 02:28:39,652
... to prove him right?

1982
02:28:43,404 --> 02:28:44,445
You can do it.

1983
02:28:52,780 --> 02:28:54,906
We have lost a lot here.

1984
02:28:57,781 --> 02:28:59,322
I know there's no hope for me.

1985
02:29:00,449 --> 02:29:04,907
- Shonali...
- But if this show helps you make a comeback...

1986
02:29:07,283 --> 02:29:08,575
It is worth the risk.

1987
02:29:28,619 --> 02:29:30,745
I have never interfered
in your decisions.

1988
02:29:31,328 --> 02:29:32,412
So why do it now?

1989
02:29:32,661 --> 02:29:33,745
Because, I am concerned.

1990
02:29:33,954 --> 02:29:36,538
To make Meghna the show
stopper for such an important show...

1991
02:29:36,746 --> 02:29:37,788
... it's foolishness!

1992
02:29:38,662 --> 02:29:40,955
And you know
what she did at Rohit's show.

1993
02:29:41,538 --> 02:29:43,247
I don't think she has
it in her, anymore.

1994
02:29:44,873 --> 02:29:46,914
Look Rahul, try and understand.

1995
02:29:47,539 --> 02:29:48,582
The situation is different.

1996
02:29:49,206 --> 02:29:51,957
People from the Paris Fashion
Week are coming to see the finale.

1997
02:29:52,457 --> 02:29:53,957
If there is any problem in this show.

1998
02:29:54,332 --> 02:29:55,791
Then Paris is out of the question.

1999
02:29:56,791 --> 02:29:59,416
It could be disastrous
for you and for my brand.

2000
02:30:00,459 --> 02:30:03,666
Abhijeet, I know you
care about me, but...

2001
02:30:03,876 --> 02:30:04,917
I think you are overreacting.

2002
02:30:05,417 --> 02:30:06,460
Nothing of that sort will happen.

2003
02:30:06,625 --> 02:30:07,667
Maybe you are right.

2004
02:30:07,793 --> 02:30:09,918
But is it necessary to take
such a big risk forthis show?

2005
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:12,461
There are other shows,
give her a chance there.

2006
02:30:12,752 --> 02:30:14,626
No, Abhijeet. It'll be too late then.

2007
02:30:15,544 --> 02:30:17,961
I mean, Meghna needs
our help right now.

2008
02:30:19,545 --> 02:30:22,753
Look, I know what I am doing.
Just trust me.

2009
02:30:23,753 --> 02:30:24,796
You think about it.

2010
02:30:37,298 --> 02:30:38,630
Oh!!

2011
02:30:46,966 --> 02:30:49,632
The Kimaya Fashion Week
has begun with a controversy.

2012
02:30:49,967 --> 02:30:52,216
Bollywood's ace
designer Vinay Khosla...

2013
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:56,968
has accused upcoming designer
Zulfi Khan with stealing his designs.

2014
02:30:57,301 --> 02:30:59,343
Zulfi has copied all my designs.

2015
02:30:59,968 --> 02:31:02,969
I had designed them for a film,
which he has stolen from there.

2016
02:31:03,302 --> 02:31:05,344
I can show you the DVD.

2017
02:31:10,553 --> 02:31:11,970
Side... side, please.

2018
02:31:18,305 --> 02:31:21,972
Rohit's driver will come
to pick you up from the airport.

2019
02:31:22,221 --> 02:31:24,973
- Come directly to the venue. Okay?
- Did you have dinner?

2020
02:31:25,222 --> 02:31:26,806
No, I havejust returned
from a fitting session.

2021
02:31:27,306 --> 02:31:30,681
Okay dear, take care of yourself.
We will be there.

2022
02:31:30,891 --> 02:31:32,432
- Okay.
- Bye. - Bye.

2023
02:31:42,434 --> 02:31:43,476
Shonali!

2024
02:31:53,518 --> 02:31:54,561
Shonali!

2025
02:32:01,312 --> 02:32:02,354
Shonali!

2026
02:32:10,313 --> 02:32:11,355
Oh no.

2027
02:32:16,856 --> 02:32:17,982
Shonali...

2028
02:32:35,859 --> 02:32:37,860
- One second.
- Okay. - Yes, Meghna.

2029
02:32:38,318 --> 02:32:40,234
Janet, Shonali isn't at home.

2030
02:32:40,318 --> 02:32:42,735
The house is a mess.
Don't know what to do?

2031
02:32:42,861 --> 02:32:43,986
Relax, Meghna. Take it easy.

2032
02:32:44,861 --> 02:32:45,986
- What is it?
- We'll be there soon.

2033
02:32:55,570 --> 02:32:56,654
Who are these people?

2034
02:32:56,863 --> 02:32:57,988
Who are they?

2035
02:33:03,864 --> 02:33:04,906
Hi. Biren...

2036
02:33:05,864 --> 02:33:06,990
Hi... have you seen Shonali around?

2037
02:33:08,781 --> 02:33:09,865
Did she come here?

2038
02:33:10,739 --> 02:33:11,781
Why would she come here?

2039
02:33:12,449 --> 02:33:13,532
Desperate woman!

2040
02:33:13,657 --> 02:33:15,698
She hasn't paid me five thousand
for the stuff as yet.

2041
02:33:16,324 --> 02:33:17,657
She's probably lying
around on the streets.

2042
02:33:20,325 --> 02:33:21,992
Okay, thanks.

2043
02:33:23,408 --> 02:33:24,451
Let's go.

2044
02:33:28,910 --> 02:33:30,244
Shinde, pay attention.

2045
02:33:30,576 --> 02:33:32,994
If you get any information,
call immediately.

2046
02:33:33,869 --> 02:33:35,535
Alright.

2047
02:33:36,661 --> 02:33:38,995
We've sent out a search party.

2048
02:33:39,245 --> 02:33:40,870
Look, don't panic.

2049
02:33:40,995 --> 02:33:42,996
We have your number.

2050
02:33:45,538 --> 02:33:47,787
If we get any information...

2051
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:49,330
... we will call you.

2052
02:33:49,413 --> 02:33:50,997
- But...
- Relax.

2053
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:53,998
Sir, please try your best.

2054
02:33:54,456 --> 02:33:56,456
Meghna, let's go.

2055
02:33:57,622 --> 02:33:58,747
- Thank you, inspector.
- Thank you.

2056
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:04,540
Meghna, enter...

2057
02:34:04,958 --> 02:34:09,375
<i>"Don't know ifl am... "</i>

2058
02:34:09,791 --> 02:34:11,541
Walk properly, Meghna.
What are you doing?

2059
02:34:17,961 --> 02:34:19,751
You forgot your turn, Meghna!

2060
02:34:20,293 --> 02:34:21,335
Meghna, come on.

2061
02:34:21,418 --> 02:34:22,460
Concentrate on what you have to do.

2062
02:34:23,543 --> 02:34:24,794
Sorry.

2063
02:34:29,003 --> 02:34:30,670
Don't worry.
We'll find Shonali.

2064
02:34:31,004 --> 02:34:32,462
We've informed the police.

2065
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:34,004
Everything will be alright.

2066
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:36,880
You just focus on the show, okay?

2067
02:34:37,338 --> 02:34:39,546
And I promise everything will be fine.

2068
02:34:39,629 --> 02:34:42,006
- Got it?
- Yes, got it.

2069
02:34:42,297 --> 02:34:43,339
Okay?

2070
02:34:47,297 --> 02:34:48,465
Okay. Full.

2071
02:34:48,548 --> 02:34:50,756
Now where will we...

2072
02:34:50,966 --> 02:34:53,673
No but... that's okay.

2073
02:34:54,299 --> 02:34:56,258
Great... Iook, it looks cute.

2074
02:34:56,549 --> 02:34:57,967
Come on, you can have this straight.

2075
02:34:58,008 --> 02:35:01,884
Okay girls! Ready? Let's line up
and have a great show.

2076
02:35:02,009 --> 02:35:06,343
How is it? Sure?
No, turn around, stand up.

2077
02:35:13,677 --> 02:35:15,802
- Are you okay?
- I am okay.

2078
02:35:15,886 --> 02:35:18,761
- You need something?
- No. - Okay.

2079
02:35:18,803 --> 02:35:21,345
- Janet, please come here.
- I'll just be back.

2080
02:35:30,347 --> 02:35:31,889
Ladies and Gentlemen,
kindly take your seats.

2081
02:35:32,430 --> 02:35:33,555
Go, Diandra!

2082
02:35:35,013 --> 02:35:36,306
Alicia.

2083
02:36:32,773 --> 02:36:38,691
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

2084
02:36:40,442 --> 02:36:43,484
Ask him to call Meghna Mathur.

2085
02:36:43,567 --> 02:36:46,317
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

2086
02:36:46,359 --> 02:36:47,443
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

2087
02:36:47,525 --> 02:36:53,318
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

2088
02:36:54,569 --> 02:37:00,320
<i>"It's difficult. I shall give up my life. "</i>

2089
02:37:02,570 --> 02:37:07,654
<i>"My dreams. "</i>

2090
02:37:08,988 --> 02:37:11,906
Meghna, you are next,
come on. Come on!

2091
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:14,822
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

2092
02:37:15,448 --> 02:37:21,323
Lets go.

2093
02:37:23,323 --> 02:37:28,450
<i>"I shall give up my life. "</i>

2094
02:37:31,325 --> 02:37:33,325
<i>"It's difficult. I shall give up my life. "</i>

2095
02:37:36,326 --> 02:37:37,910
- Ready? You are next.
- Yeah.

2096
02:37:46,327 --> 02:37:47,369
Meghna, your phone is ringing.

2097
02:37:47,661 --> 02:37:48,912
- Hello...
- Are you mad, Shruti?

2098
02:37:48,995 --> 02:37:50,871
- Hello, Miss Meghna.
- Yes.

2099
02:37:51,328 --> 02:37:53,746
This is Inspector Gighe from
Bandra police station.

2100
02:37:55,079 --> 02:37:56,329
There's bad news.

2101
02:37:56,579 --> 02:37:58,329
We've found Shonali Gujral's body...

2102
02:37:58,413 --> 02:37:59,455
... at Khar East.

2103
02:38:00,580 --> 02:38:02,331
We suspect that the cause of death...

2104
02:38:02,414 --> 02:38:04,580
... could be drug overdose.

2105
02:38:05,664 --> 02:38:10,789
Please come to Bhabha Hospital
and claim the body.

2106
02:38:11,457 --> 02:38:13,749
Hello, Ms. Meghna.

2107
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:15,374
Hello, Ms. Meghna.

2108
02:38:19,666 --> 02:38:21,417
30 seconds to go for Meghna.

2109
02:38:21,917 --> 02:38:23,000
30 seconds.

2110
02:38:30,460 --> 02:38:32,878
Ready? Okay? Stand by and send her...

2111
02:38:32,919 --> 02:38:34,878
Go.

2112
02:38:38,794 --> 02:38:39,920
Send her in quickly.

2113
02:38:40,337 --> 02:38:43,921
Meghna, you have to go now.
Come on, go!

2114
02:38:49,463 --> 02:38:50,546
Move.

2115
02:38:51,422 --> 02:38:52,671
Meghna, walk!

2116
02:38:52,796 --> 02:38:54,340
Come now, walk!

2117
02:38:56,882 --> 02:38:58,882
Walk, it's your turn! Go for it!

2118
02:38:59,006 --> 02:39:00,341
Meghna! Walk!

2119
02:39:00,424 --> 02:39:01,883
Come on Meghna, walk!

2120
02:39:04,007 --> 02:39:05,341
Meghna!

2121
02:39:06,633 --> 02:39:07,758
Put the lights.

2122
02:39:13,967 --> 02:39:15,343
Meghna! Walk!

2123
02:39:15,634 --> 02:39:17,927
Come on, Meghna, walk!

2124
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:23,802
Go.

2125
02:39:24,345 --> 02:39:26,345
Meghna walk.

2126
02:39:32,970 --> 02:39:35,012
What are you waiting for?
Go for it!

2127
02:39:35,346 --> 02:39:37,347
Come Meghna, quickly.

2128
02:39:43,097 --> 02:39:44,890
Meghna, now!

2129
02:42:15,413 --> 02:42:18,374
When we dream, nobody tells
us what we'd have to...

2130
02:42:18,456 --> 02:42:20,665
... give up to achieve them.

2131
02:42:21,915 --> 02:42:27,375
I lost Shonali in the same
moment I achieved success.

2132
02:42:29,083 --> 02:42:30,917
I was pained by her loss.

2133
02:42:31,667 --> 02:42:37,376
But I had the feeling that
she gave me a reason to dream.

2134
02:42:48,920 --> 02:42:52,378
Even after everything
I went through...

2135
02:42:52,461 --> 02:42:56,004
life provided me another opportunity.

2136
02:42:56,921 --> 02:42:58,796
To find myself again.
