00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,567
There's a thin line
separating a fool from a moron...

3
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:05,578
...on one end of the line lies the fool
and on the other, the moron.

4
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:11,011
Snap the line
and you don't know who's who?

5
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,187
Thats the million dollar question,
my pretty polly.

6
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:15,853
Let us to see who the pretty groom is?

7
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:19,527
I'll be damned!

8
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:22,029
Is it not Mr. Fool himself?!

9
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:23,529
Ya ya!

10
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:27,291
To become a true moron
you've to at least be married...

11
00:04:27,903 --> 00:04:30,201
and by the look of things,
you're not getting married in a hurry.

12
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,697
Ya ya!

13
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:34,102
Yes Sir! There's been
a change in the schedule.

14
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,108
The half-caste's abducting
your bride even as we chat.

15
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,107
Brother Omi?!

16
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,186
Ya ya!

17
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:54,184
"Hail Friendship"!
As a friend, it was my duty to warn you.

18
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:58,896
Grab that moped and run like the wind.

19
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:02,632
If you've got what it takes,
go save Dolly.

20
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:09,839
Now scurry!
Your wedding march past is over!

21
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,045
Ya ya!

22
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:14,844
Aren't you a charming one?

23
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:18,219
Ya! Right... Liar.

24
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:35,199
If I lie,
then I make love to a filthy bitch

25
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,528
and if not,
then that bitch is your mother!

26
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:57,555
Your wedding march is history!

27
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,849
The marriage party's stopping here!

28
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:34,521
Grab the phones darling!

29
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,191
What the hell could've held them up?!

30
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,497
Can't even get through the bloody phones!

31
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,220
Omi Shukla has abducted Dolly!

32
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,192
Omi Shukla has abducted Dolly!

33
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,758
Omi Shukla has abducted Dolly!

34
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:50,964
Wait! Not the red one, hit the green.

35
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,540
- Screw you!
- Now what?

36
00:07:57,245 --> 00:08:00,214
Come on Langda...

37
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:05,246
be a sport!

38
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:12,482
What happened, big brother?
Forgot your tools at home or what!

39
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:18,163
Your mother's borrowed them... swine!
Stop screwing around now.

40
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,828
I'm sick of your bloody red, blue, yellow!

41
00:08:23,204 --> 00:08:26,935
Decide your colour once and for all...

42
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:30,010
then sit back and watch daddy play!

43
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:36,916
Not bad, champ! Go flick the yellow one.

44
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:48,024
Ringa Ringa Roses!
Pocket full of poses!

45
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,963
Bingo! Go stuff yourself... loser.

46
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:04,541
When it comes to marbles,
No one screws with Langda Tyagi...

47
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,813
Anyone got the guts to doubt that?

48
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,493
Where is Omi?

49
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:25,756
Where the hell is he?

50
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:29,968
You Anglo shit!

51
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,547
Even dogs show more character... Omi!

52
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:21,178
Was my daughter
the only girl left in the province?

53
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:25,119
Actually, it's my fault...

54
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:29,891
had forgotten that you are
a half caste.

55
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:35,164
That bloody slave girl
had borne you... right?

56
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,093
Bloody bastard!

57
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:43,270
You're right as always sir...

58
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:48,942
Wish you knew that your own daughter's
heart beats for this half caste.

59
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,217
Bastard!

60
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:07,533
Bhaisaab's calling... May I?

61
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,129
Regards Bhaisaab, that's right...

62
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:17,537
They here... both of them.

63
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:21,048
Lawyer sir?

64
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:27,544
He's threatening to blow
Brother Omi's brains out.

65
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,922
One shot and... finito!

66
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,563
Ya Bhaisaab... One sec!

67
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,897
So, what's going on over there?!

68
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:41,228
Lawyer sir?

69
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:42,570
Omi?

70
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:52,239
This silence is getting boring friends.

71
00:11:52,614 --> 00:11:54,343
Someone's got to speak up.

72
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:59,585
Big brother, this sonuvabitch abducted
my daughter on her wedding day.

73
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:06,186
So I heard. Now let me update you...

74
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:11,964
Your prime eyewitness Jalaluddin
has returned from Muscat!

75
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:16,203
The case is slated
to be heard next week...

76
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:19,534
So do postpone your shootout
for tonight...

77
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,209
Or meet him up in Court next week.

78
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:24,545
That will be all dears.
Have a good day.

79
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,549
The news is confirmed Bhaisaab...

80
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,145
Indore Singh had gone to Muscat himself.

81
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:35,646
And now Surendra Captain
has become his General.

82
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:41,119
They are hiding him
behind the brick kiln in Pilakhwa.

83
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:45,891
Why in the world is Indore Singh
rushing to his grave?

84
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:56,105
Whenever a bitch goes down to pee,
every dog thinks its his lucky day.

85
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,917
All Visitors are warned
that anybody carrying any kind of...

86
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,743
alcohol, cigarettes, narcotics etc
will be found punishable by law.

87
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:13,120
Any kind of weapon, matchboxes or
mobile sim cards is also prohibited,

88
00:13:13,561 --> 00:13:16,189
strict action will be taken against...

89
00:13:16,564 --> 00:13:19,192
Psst... I happen to be carrying
all of the above.

90
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,131
What are you gonna do?
- Liar!

91
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,936
Get lost sonuvabitch... stamp this!

92
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,546
Have known Omkara
since his childhood...

93
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,780
but never heard anything
about him being a womanizer.

94
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:12,516
You've even known Dolly
since she was a toddler.

95
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:19,186
You think she would've eloped
with this gangster willingly.

96
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,088
Our home fire's
been hushed since yesterday...

97
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,034
the whole community's slandering us...

98
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,939
how can you expect me to hand over
my precious jewel to that monster?!

99
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,978
He's a damned half caste at that!

100
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:48,812
I have no more will to live...
I need justice, Bhaisaab!

101
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,659
Brother Omi! Please come.

102
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:06,164
If I've done this out of lust.
Call me a eunuch.

103
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:12,171
If his daughter says I'm a liar,
Omkara will cut his tongue off...

104
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:15,577
and shine Lawyer sir's shoes with it
for the rest of his life!

105
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:40,533
Don't be scared... speak your mind.

106
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:52,046
Has anyone... and I mean anyone,
forced you into any kind of submission?

107
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,931
I've always followed the tune of my heart.

108
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,501
Papa... please forgive me.

109
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:17,509
I can't live without Omkara.

110
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:51,041
"Don't trust what your eyes say.
Your eyes will betray you."

111
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:37,684
God knows how it all began...
how I lost my heart to Omkara.

112
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:45,062
I was in love... but it was too late.

113
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:25,167
I remember feeling like a blind bird
plunging down an empty well...

114
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,176
everything seemed hopeless...

115
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,985
And then I decided
I'll end my wretched life...

116
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:42,990
But then there was no point to it,

117
00:18:43,357 --> 00:18:46,224
When who I was dying for
didn't even know why.

118
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,200
Rajju will marry me dead.

119
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:04,735
Since you won't in this lifetime,
let me confess...

120
00:19:06,514 --> 00:19:09,005
I'm yours and yours only.

121
00:19:10,184 --> 00:19:13,153
Put me down in your list of slain.

122
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,836
Let bygones be bygones.

123
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,106
Both of you should now
seek blessings from the elders.

124
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:08,538
Now don't you dare get married
before I'm released.

125
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:16,205
See, I'm not averse
to this prison life.

126
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,149
But if that blasted evidence
reaches court...

127
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,289
the Parliament will annul
my election nomination.

128
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,118
And what if they don't see reason?

129
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:32,555
Well then... go ahead.

130
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:55,581
General... may you never forget
the two faced monster a woman can be!

131
00:20:57,057 --> 00:21:02,996
She who can dupe her own father,
will never be anyone's to claim.

132
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,910
Fill in whatever amount you want.

133
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,589
Bloody hell! Got away!

134
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:12,031
Kichlu... me thinks we're not cut out
for these over the table deals.

135
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:18,894
Don't rush to your grave Captain.
Quote your price.

136
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:23,637
The Parliament seat.

137
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:30,106
The one Indore sir's been slogging
his ass off for the last five years.

138
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:34,145
Even if he polishes it
for the next five lives,

139
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:37,152
he won't be able to defeat Bhaisaab.

140
00:22:37,591 --> 00:22:39,559
Truth be said...

141
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:45,098
but only if Tewari Bhaisaab
contests in the first place.

142
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:54,568
It was a small nick...
but its gonna bleed as hell.

143
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,072
Got it?

144
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,537
Omi... Come break bread with us.

145
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,972
Have got special homemade food.

146
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,085
Holy cow!

147
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,737
Bloody hell!

148
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:04,571
How many will you smash, Captain?

149
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,910
Our guys are stationed
outside all TV channels.

150
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,053
Don't miss the climax.

151
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:23,062
Sorry Captain sir! But you should
teach Brother Indore a thing or two.

152
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:26,530
Bastard's not even wearing a condom.

153
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:29,536
Who is this chick by the way?

154
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,063
Indore bro...

155
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:38,142
...pray which meeting
did you attend last night?

156
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:43,071
Hmm... the fund raising one
or the skirt raising one?

157
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,551
Now watch the parliament on the bloody TV
for the rest of your life.

158
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:56,289
Omi brother... hats off to you.

159
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,556
I concede. You are the biggest General
in the province.

160
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:05,094
'Even your pee
can flush out all your foes'

161
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:10,167
But before leaving,
I have a poser for you...

162
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:18,507
Kichlu and I have had a bet...
for 100 bucks.

163
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:29,762
This one says that you'll marry
Raghunath's lass for sure...

164
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:35,866
and I feel that Omi's
still got his wits about him...

165
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,206
he just wants to wham bang her... right?

166
00:25:42,576 --> 00:25:45,010
I win that 100 bucks, sonuvabitch.

167
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:26,911
Grandma! Go tell the village
that Captain's lost his bet.

168
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,051
Take your 100 bucks from Captain.

169
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,510
Let go, Omi!

170
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:08,485
Next time round, bet on horses...

171
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,153
not tigers.

172
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,152
"The drums salute the greatest..."

173
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:19,498
"the greatest warrior
of them all... Omkara!"

174
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:27,159
The battle is over
The tables are turned

175
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:32,733
The righteous is out of prison
And the enemy is burnt

176
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:39,070
As per the high Command's wishes...

177
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,942
...I will be contesting
for a parliament seat this year.

178
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:48,779
I hereby appoint
youth leader Omkara Shukla...

179
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:51,290
...as my successor in the local assembly

180
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:56,058
And Bhaisaab, who will replace Omkara?

181
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,861
Who will be the new General of the party?

182
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:03,031
Hello?

183
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,538
Can't hear a word... Hello?

184
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,874
Bhaisaab?
- What was the question?

185
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,539
Think its disconnected!

186
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,821
Brother Langda! Brother Langda!

187
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,237
Where are your glorious feet?

188
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,140
They walked off
to buy some slippers... Moron!

189
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:26,211
Let me kiss them once.
Please just once!

190
00:31:28,655 --> 00:31:30,885
Don't hold me back!
- Buzz off! You scum!

191
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:39,892
My my! The new General is a tyrant!

192
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:43,795
What?!

193
00:31:55,115 --> 00:32:00,985
Hail General Langda!
Hail General Langda!

194
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:09,527
Hail General Langda!
Hail General Langda!

195
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,193
Kesu Firangi!

196
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,152
All the college students
are under his command.

197
00:34:56,596 --> 00:35:01,056
The elections will be
a cakewalk for us.

198
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:07,266
And Langda?

199
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,503
He's like a brother.
He'll understand.

200
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:20,844
Hail Kesu Firangi!
Hail Kesu Firangi!

201
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,630
Run Golu! They're here!

202
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,797
Move out of the way!

203
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:59,143
Not bad at all!
May you be protected from all evil...

204
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:03,213
Talk about a match made in heaven...
like milk in a pot of coal.

205
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:09,086
Sorry Omi bro! My tongue slipped...

206
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,163
More like a candy in a crow's mouth!

207
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:18,167
OK OK! I give up!

208
00:37:19,105 --> 00:37:21,505
Like sandal shining
in the darkest night!

209
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:25,501
Please brother!
I promise... no more jokes!

210
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:27,847
Please let me go.

211
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:32,842
Like a magic flute
in the hands of the Dark lord.

212
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:47,123
What're you staring at, Grandma?
- Staring at your luck!

213
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:52,195
How in the world did you get such a
fair girl in these parts?!

214
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,924
I said good morning!

215
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:33,106
Bro... Rajju's come to visit.

216
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,912
Let them in... but grab their weapons.

217
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:44,190
Righto.

218
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:00,863
Get going.

219
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:05,811
You wait.

220
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:37,876
When will the priest be here, sis?

221
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:44,513
My high priestess,
this is an inauspicious month.

222
00:39:48,588 --> 00:39:51,216
Our bride-to-be
will have to be more patient.

223
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,028
Not bad at all! That smells good!

224
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:00,522
You turned out to be quite some cook...

225
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:04,865
what's the secret?

226
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,537
My grandma's formula...

227
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:12,105
She told me that the way
to a man's heart is through his belly.

228
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:15,543
What bull! My Grandma

229
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:18,546
always told to me to aim a bit lower.

230
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:38,570
Papa's sent this little gesture
for the elections.

231
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:52,685
But that's a long way off...

232
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,581
Ya ya! It's me who's
stayed away too long!

233
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:03,927
Brother Omi! I had nothing to do
with that marriage fiasco.

234
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:08,628
If I'd had any inkling,
I'd have peed over the holy fires myself.

235
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:29,955
I'll take your leave then.

236
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:37,024
Wait! It'll be dark
by the time you reach.

237
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:42,828
Stay back. We're celebrating
Golu's birthday tomorrow.

238
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,037
Golu's happy birthday!

239
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:48,065
How many years old
will the little man be?

240
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:50,572
Er... Golu?

241
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:53,177
Must be eight... or is it nine?

242
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:57,242
O...! Listen!

243
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,521
Just taste this once...

244
00:42:12,298 --> 00:42:13,925
Sweet enough?

245
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:21,229
Just twirl your finger once more
in the pan, it'll be perfect.

246
00:42:36,088 --> 00:42:40,184
My Romeo! Mix some water
in your booze at least.

247
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:46,360
Here... have a swig.

248
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:57,167
My dear friend...
I gave you one chance...

249
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,570
But alas... you don't have the guts...

250
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:04,047
I do dammit...!

251
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:08,518
That blasted moped got a puncture that day,
else I would have shown you guys.

252
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:24,861
I can lay down my life
for Dolly... understood?

253
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,541
That'll be the day!
Stop drinking now...

254
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:36,211
I'm serious... I can
give up my life for her!

255
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:38,951
Give the bottle first!

256
00:43:41,587 --> 00:43:43,214
I'm not joking... really!

257
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:46,251
I'll jump into the river!
- Ya ya!

258
00:43:48,928 --> 00:43:50,896
I'll really jump!

259
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:54,165
No one's holding you back... sissy!

260
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,233
Go jump!

261
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:02,233
'Dolly' my ass!

262
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:07,709
Jump... chicken shit!

263
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,524
Bloody hell! You don't know how to swim?!

264
00:44:24,564 --> 00:44:26,191
What the...!

265
00:44:31,571 --> 00:44:36,531
What do you have to say now... brother!

266
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:42,239
It's not a question of guts...

267
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:45,879
Its a question of business...

268
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:51,556
if I run amok, my father's
booze contracts will be snatched.

269
00:44:56,596 --> 00:45:01,226
And you, Brother sir Langda?!
Who are you to talk about nerve?

270
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:07,062
What guts did you display when Omi
publicly chose Kesu as his successor?

271
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:13,176
For the last 15 years,

272
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:17,505
you've been faithfully serving
that half caste on a leg and a half...

273
00:45:19,852 --> 00:45:24,812
Hail Langda General!
Hail General Langda!

274
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:35,094
That pretender Kesu
comes out of nowhere...

275
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:39,971
and coolly snatches the
bone out of your mouth.

276
00:45:41,674 --> 00:45:43,972
Where did your guts go walking then?!

277
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:46,534
Company garden?

278
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:02,886
You know Rajju,
you are finally making some sense.

279
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:07,498
Both of us are damned
to lead donkey's lives!

280
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:19,738
God bless your filthy soul...!

281
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:21,278
Good lady!

282
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:27,046
Langda! Help me!

283
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:40,866
Help me please!

284
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,492
Think I've caught the chill.
The water was freezing.

285
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:25,161
Look at it this way...
now you know how to swim.

286
00:48:29,542 --> 00:48:34,036
Now I'll teach you how to fly...

287
00:48:37,783 --> 00:48:39,751
like pigeons in the sky.

288
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:42,521
Bye Bye baby bird...

289
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:50,055
fly away with Dolly.

290
00:48:53,165 --> 00:48:59,035
Far far away!
To a galaxy someday.

291
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,200
Eh? Eh? Eh?

292
00:49:04,577 --> 00:49:06,477
Buzz off... liar!

293
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:11,074
If I lie, then I make
love to a filthy bitch...

294
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:14,145
and if not,
then that bitch is your mother.

295
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:23,825
And isn't it Mr. Busybody himself?

296
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:31,036
Lower your eyes while
addressing the new General.

297
00:49:33,205 --> 00:49:36,732
But of course...
my adorable bastard!

298
00:49:41,213 --> 00:49:43,511
I'll slice your tongue out.

299
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,041
In your dreams!
Won't even let you lick it.

300
00:49:50,556 --> 00:49:53,081
Hey Billo Chamanbahar...

301
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:59,190
You know why I love you Billo baby?

302
00:49:59,832 --> 00:50:00,799
Why?

303
00:50:02,268 --> 00:50:07,729
Cos' you're the biggest tease
in the world.

304
00:50:10,576 --> 00:50:13,101
And you know why
I'm crazy about you?

305
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:14,546
Hmm?

306
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:21,218
Cos' you say this to every
third girl you meet... bloody lech!

307
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:28,021
You still haven't answered.
- What?

308
00:50:29,028 --> 00:50:30,893
Will you marry me?

309
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:36,229
Let go... creep!

310
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:48,569
This house hadn't had an heir for years.

311
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:55,247
Then Pa fell in love and I was born.

312
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:05,052
My mother belonged to a lower caste...
that's why they call me a half caste.

313
00:51:11,337 --> 00:51:19,301
A crescent, though half,
is still called a moon.

314
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:25,884
Ouch!

315
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,685
What happened?

316
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:31,552
My back caught a catch this morning.

317
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:59,981
What is our new General up to?
Seems to have vanished.

318
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:02,847
He's at his usual score...
composing duets inside.

319
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:11,187
General sir!
Grace us with some time please.

320
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:16,022
Do not forget your subjects
in such a hurry.

321
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:23,063
Perch your behind please.

322
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:26,009
What brother Langda?!
Not having any fun?

323
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:31,072
What should your honour be served with?
- No thanks. My tea's on its way.

324
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:34,746
Tea?! No hard stuff for our lord?

325
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:40,886
That's one thing I can't handle, bro.

326
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:43,626
Uh oh...!

327
00:52:46,765 --> 00:52:47,732
Mental...

328
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:53,832
Run and get a bottle of milk
for our General here.

329
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,906
And make sure
its one of those nippled ones!

330
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:24,534
Here... put this on.

331
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,199
Whose jewel is this?

332
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:32,537
It's not a jewel...
its our family heirloom.

333
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:37,071
Its adorned the brides
of this house down the ages.

334
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:40,882
Keep it. It's yours from today.

335
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:45,557
Treasure it with care!

336
00:53:49,261 --> 00:53:51,821
Put it on and show me first.

337
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,333
First shut your eyes.

338
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:13,181
Could we have
that 'beedi' number please?

339
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:19,113
There's a slight problem
with that request.

340
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,228
I've forgotten the words
to that song...

341
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:28,196
We'd love to be of help.

342
00:54:55,861 --> 00:55:01,891
"No quilt in sight... this cold breeze
arouses the hell out of me."

343
00:55:11,643 --> 00:55:16,512
"It's best to share somebody's quilt."

344
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,851
"Go borrow heat
from the next fellow's oven."

345
00:55:29,628 --> 00:55:36,864
"Light your fags with the heat
of my bosom..."

346
00:55:37,903 --> 00:55:40,303
"its burning up inside me!"

347
00:56:01,927 --> 00:56:08,833
"Let smoke not slip out of your lips...
the world's smoked out already!"

348
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:17,163
"No crime's been charged...
why do I still feel sentenced to death?"

349
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:21,498
"Haul me to your court one afternoon."

350
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:25,502
"Handcuff me with my anklets."

351
00:57:25,877 --> 00:57:30,177
"Haul me up in the afternoon"

352
00:57:31,983 --> 00:57:36,181
"Sentence me... punish me severely."

353
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:47,188
"Light your stoves with the heat of
my bosom..."

354
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:50,530
"its burning up inside me!"

355
00:58:35,881 --> 00:58:42,514
"No knife's sharp
enough to match your nibbles."

356
00:58:47,826 --> 00:58:52,854
"The way you leave
your teeth marks behind..."

357
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:58,867
"farmers would forget
how to cut their crops"

358
00:58:59,671 --> 00:59:04,199
"Please Billo... would you settle down
with a brute like this?"

359
00:59:23,528 --> 00:59:28,158
"Nobody warned me...
nobody woke me up."

360
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:36,503
"Suddenly you come into my quilt..."

361
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:43,910
"trying to impress me
with your clove breath."

362
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:53,514
"Burn your coals with the heat of
my bosom..."

363
00:59:54,025 --> 00:59:56,585
"its burning up inside me!"

364
01:00:12,577 --> 01:00:16,536
"It's best to share somebody's quilt..."

365
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:29,891
"go borrow heat from
the next fellow's oven."

366
01:00:35,767 --> 01:00:37,564
Bastard! I'd asked you not to smoke!

367
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:04,288
Let go man... you're piss drunk!

368
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:28,718
Brother Omi...

369
01:02:04,723 --> 01:02:08,591
Is somebody going to bloody own up?

370
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:17,097
Who the hell started
this brawl? Langda?

371
01:02:24,643 --> 01:02:28,807
Let it go Omi bro...
We'll sort it in the morning.

372
01:02:30,582 --> 01:02:34,074
Don't rush to your grave...
answer the bloody question.

373
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:37,254
Whose fault was it?

374
01:02:43,795 --> 01:02:45,763
It was booze.

375
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:52,098
Partly booze... partly my fault!

376
01:02:54,973 --> 01:02:58,932
This poor child had warned me
that he can't hold his drink...

377
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:04,905
I fingered him and he got plastered.

378
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:09,112
I should be punished... not him!

379
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:23,194
General! Its neither booze...
nor Langda!

380
01:03:24,602 --> 01:03:29,062
It's my fault... for having
chosen you as the General!

381
01:03:32,644 --> 01:03:40,551
Stay out of my sight for a few days
else I'll skin you alive.

382
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:03,566
Don't worry.
Omi's anger is like camphor.

383
01:04:05,376 --> 01:04:07,742
It'll vanish in no time... eat something.

384
01:04:11,549 --> 01:04:12,516
Not bad!

385
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:14,912
I've been toiling away
at these chappatis...

386
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,188
and nobody cares a shit!

387
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:20,820
Why are you taking it out on the food?
Eat up now!

388
01:04:23,561 --> 01:04:31,525
If your face stays bloated like this
the fat chappatis will start blushing.

389
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:38,639
Not bad at all!
That's a rare smile in this weather...

390
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:42,202
Don't worry... I'll speak to Brother Omi.

391
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,548
"I'll speak to Brother Omi"

392
01:04:45,884 --> 01:04:48,250
And he'll listen to you?! Surely...!

393
01:04:50,755 --> 01:04:56,887
Now Omi's not going to listen to anyone.

394
01:04:59,597 --> 01:05:02,225
There's only one voice
of reason that can help...

395
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:05,159
Dolly's voice.

396
01:05:07,872 --> 01:05:11,171
And if I'm not mistaken,
isn't she a bum chum of yours?

397
01:05:13,077 --> 01:05:16,911
We're visiting Bhaisaab over the next
2-3 days... some election work.

398
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:20,016
By the time we're back,
get Dolly in the loop.

399
01:05:21,553 --> 01:05:22,520
Cool?

400
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,517
It's cooler than the coolest!

401
01:05:24,823 --> 01:05:27,257
Now... lets see those molars.

402
01:05:30,728 --> 01:05:34,528
Have you ever fed me...
with half this love?

403
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,790
Bugger off!

404
01:05:44,242 --> 01:05:47,040
Don't panic now! I'll be there soon.

405
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:53,546
Auntyji's worried about my safety.

406
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:59,552
The C.I. D says that I might be attacked.

407
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,893
She wants me to come to the capital
for 2-3 days... till it tides over.

408
01:06:10,602 --> 01:06:12,502
2-3 days?!

409
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:16,841
In the meantime, we can start
fund raising by ourselves... right?

410
01:06:23,548 --> 01:06:28,850
Sounds fine.
Then?

411
01:06:32,557 --> 01:06:34,525
Pull the chain son.

412
01:06:45,103 --> 01:06:47,071
Any problem Bhaisaab?

413
01:06:47,572 --> 01:06:52,271
Reverse the train.
These gentlemen have to be dropped back.

414
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:54,538
Sorry?

415
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,945
You heard me!

416
01:06:57,148 --> 01:07:01,551
Golu! When you feel like a glass of juice,
what do you do?

417
01:07:01,953 --> 01:07:03,921
I massage Omi Uncle's head!

418
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:11,092
And Indu, when you want a new sparkler,
what do you do?

419
01:07:11,696 --> 01:07:14,494
Heaven only knows!
Have to massage half a leg all night!

420
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,500
So your job will be done...

421
01:07:21,873 --> 01:07:25,673
But it's not gonna be for free...
What say Kesu sir?!

422
01:07:26,144 --> 01:07:28,112
Whatever her highness demands.

423
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:30,514
It's a deal then?
- Deal.

424
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:42,517
Now you sing.

425
01:07:51,636 --> 01:07:55,538
Everything else's fine...
except its pronounced 'bottom'.

426
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:07,016
That's what I said-'bottom'.

427
01:08:07,952 --> 01:08:11,217
Fine! Will do!
- What now?

428
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:54,958
Shit! Omi bro's back!

429
01:08:55,233 --> 01:08:58,532
Langda said they'll be back in 2-3 days.
I'm screwed now!

430
01:08:58,903 --> 01:09:01,531
Hang on!
Lets sort this once and for all.

431
01:09:01,973 --> 01:09:04,874
No way! He'll skin me alive
and hang it out to dry!

432
01:09:15,186 --> 01:09:17,154
Wasn't that Kesu?

433
01:09:21,192 --> 01:09:24,491
Leave the poor boy alone now.

434
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:30,490
Why in the world would he come
to see Dolly in your absence?

435
01:09:32,537 --> 01:09:34,505
But it did look like his bike.

436
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:36,907
Come on bro, Kesu's our own.

437
01:09:37,108 --> 01:09:39,508
Why would he run
like a thief on seeing us?

438
01:09:42,547 --> 01:09:45,038
He's in town.
I'll just make him speak to you.

439
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:54,620
Hello Mental!
Just pass the phone to Kesu.

440
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:59,662
I see?

441
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:05,269
Fine then... text me later.

442
01:10:11,576 --> 01:10:12,941
What happened?

443
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:15,112
God knows! Sonuvabitch's not starting up.

444
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,878
Not the car... what about Kesu?

445
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,547
Kesu?!

446
01:10:20,952 --> 01:10:22,920
There... its started!

447
01:10:23,821 --> 01:10:27,882
Hey Langda! What's the big secret?

448
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:35,088
Can't believe that was Kesu...

449
01:10:38,603 --> 01:10:44,132
What in the world could he be up to
with Dolly at this hour?

450
01:10:52,617 --> 01:10:53,584
Dolly!

451
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:23,210
What was Kesu doing here?

452
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,463
And why did he take to his heels?

453
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:09,761
What now?

454
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,103
Speak up! What's so funny?

455
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:26,778
Every time I look into your eyes,
this single thought crosses my mind.

456
01:12:26,984 --> 01:12:28,451
What thought?

457
01:12:33,624 --> 01:12:41,588
You're either one hell of a fool...
or one hell of a witch.

458
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:55,810
"O my love..."

459
01:12:57,014 --> 01:13:01,815
"let it last forever today!"

460
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,270
"Come lets still the day!"

461
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:25,238
"Lets chase the sun away!"

462
01:13:25,809 --> 01:13:33,272
"Keep the shadows at bay... O my love!"

463
01:13:39,857 --> 01:13:44,794
"O my love...

464
01:13:47,064 --> 01:13:51,194
"Let me scold you whilst
you pretend to get scared..."

465
01:13:53,337 --> 01:13:56,204
"let my love fall
in sweet tears from your eyes..."

466
01:13:57,174 --> 01:13:59,802
"my body stitched to yours..."

467
01:14:01,011 --> 01:14:03,002
"turn your back and
you will tear me to shreds..."

468
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,148
"I will take you away with me...
my body your soul"

469
01:14:05,382 --> 01:14:08,146
"Where I end and you begin"

470
01:14:11,121 --> 01:14:16,149
"O my love..."

471
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:25,162
"let it last forever today!

472
01:14:29,273 --> 01:14:31,764
Now tell me... why am I a fool?

473
01:14:34,612 --> 01:14:39,242
Cos' what's a gorgeous girl like you
doing with a brute like me?!

474
01:14:41,218 --> 01:14:43,118
And witch?

475
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:51,795
Cos' at times I feel, deep down,

476
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:54,793
...your beauty's all evil and twisted.

477
01:14:55,432 --> 01:15:03,396
"O my love... let it last forever today!"

478
01:15:08,012 --> 01:15:13,746
"Never ever let me out of your sight!"

479
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:13,055
There's an animal caged inside you!

480
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,392
Ravenous!

481
01:18:19,436 --> 01:18:21,233
Ravenous what...

482
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,399
Cheetah?

483
01:18:28,946 --> 01:18:31,073
Wolf?

484
01:18:38,455 --> 01:18:39,752
Serpent?

485
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,256
Chamaeleon?

486
01:18:50,534 --> 01:18:54,436
Nope... You are my bunny rabbit!

487
01:19:05,916 --> 01:19:07,884
What would you like for dinner?

488
01:19:14,091 --> 01:19:16,059
I'd like to drink some blood.

489
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:36,144
"Wake up little princess!"

490
01:19:44,021 --> 01:19:48,754
"Your eyes like sweet petals!"

491
01:19:49,293 --> 01:19:53,161
"Eyes that hold me in their spell."
"May I never be away from their sight!

492
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:06,765
"The dawn blushes pink on your cheek"

493
01:20:09,313 --> 01:20:14,273
"Craving to caress you...
come now wake up...

494
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:24,791
"Your sweet flesh beckons
Comes hither a bee to tickle you"

495
01:20:25,162 --> 01:20:29,792
"Come now my darling wake up."

496
01:20:29,967 --> 01:20:34,802
"Ask for your heart's desire,
I give my word in blood"

497
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:39,138
"Just for this once... open your eyes"

498
01:20:42,346 --> 01:20:44,314
Here! I'm up.

499
01:20:45,115 --> 01:20:47,140
Can I really ask for anything?!

500
01:20:48,986 --> 01:20:50,817
Think again.

501
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,360
Forgive Kesu this one time.

502
01:21:09,006 --> 01:21:12,271
What happened?

503
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:15,776
That's not possible!
- But why?!

504
01:21:18,815 --> 01:21:23,775
If I let him off lightly,
he'll never learn in this lifetime.

505
01:21:24,988 --> 01:21:26,956
So you'll be pissed
with him all your lifetime?

506
01:21:35,165 --> 01:21:38,134
Next time please don't
make any false promises!

507
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,205
"I give my word in blood"

508
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,975
Fine. I'll forgive him
on the wedding day.

509
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,488
Do I call the priest then?
Meanie...?

510
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:12,264
According to the charts, the 3rd month
of our calendar is an auspicious time.

511
01:22:12,936 --> 01:22:15,769
What date will that be?
- The 30th of next month.

512
01:22:21,344 --> 01:22:24,108
Did you hear?!
The 30th of next month is...

513
01:22:24,347 --> 01:22:26,315
...the auspicious date for the wedding...

514
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:32,115
which means Kesu gets your favor
in exactly 5 weeks!

515
01:22:32,522 --> 01:22:34,786
Kesu gets his pardon in 5 weeks!

516
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,295
She seems happier with the forgiving
than with the wedding... isn't it?

517
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:45,791
Dolly really dotes on our Kesu.

518
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:54,136
They've known each other a long time?
- They both went to the same college.

519
01:22:55,378 --> 01:22:58,814
No wonder!

520
01:23:04,387 --> 01:23:06,287
No wonder what?!

521
01:23:07,791 --> 01:23:12,285
Nothing nothing!
Me and my filthy mind... that's all.

522
01:23:14,164 --> 01:23:19,431
Langda! Tell me what's on your mind!

523
01:23:22,227 --> 01:23:26,357
No... its just that
Dolly's such a stunner...

524
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:32,362
and you know how Kesu is!
Bloody flirt!

525
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:37,931
Just wondering if he ever had
any designs on her?

526
01:23:40,378 --> 01:23:43,347
On second thoughts,
what a silly idea!

527
01:23:46,918 --> 01:23:54,882
Kesu is a sweet soul but
he strays around too much... bloody slut!

528
01:23:56,428 --> 01:24:01,559
It won't be a bad idea brother if we keep
a close watch on Dolly till the wedding.

529
01:24:02,734 --> 01:24:08,502
The world is full of big bad wolves
and our Dolly is too too naive!

530
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:28,856
Brother Kichlu!

531
01:25:39,564 --> 01:25:42,226
Patience son...

532
01:25:46,237 --> 01:25:48,228
We should lie low till the polls.

533
01:25:51,076 --> 01:25:53,374
If we keep silent,
we'll be labelled cowards.

534
01:25:54,913 --> 01:25:58,371
Indore Singh's days are numbered!

535
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:08,825
Fine... at least wait till
your wedding's past.

536
01:26:11,229 --> 01:26:12,321
Wedding?!

537
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,830
Hmm... isn't there
a date for next month?

538
01:26:18,203 --> 01:26:20,364
How did you get to know?
- I told him.

539
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:25,500
The way you people dashed off
the other day,

540
01:26:26,211 --> 01:26:28,839
I got really worried.

541
01:26:29,881 --> 01:26:33,840
I called for Kesu and
thankfully he got me here.

542
01:26:44,295 --> 01:26:45,853
Good show!

543
01:27:07,185 --> 01:27:10,313
First stop Kichlu,
then goes Indore Singh.

544
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:15,321
Langda... you hit town
and sniff out Kichlu.

545
01:27:17,062 --> 01:27:24,833
Mental! Take Babulal's help and
get me Indore Singh's final itinerary.

546
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:46,853
Anything for Kesu, bro?

547
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:52,196
Somebody's got to hand out
the wedding invites!

548
01:28:17,322 --> 01:28:19,222
Can't you see...!
I'm on the phone...

549
01:28:51,222 --> 01:28:54,350
Your pain is your own...
for no one else to see...

550
01:28:55,593 --> 01:28:57,857
The truth is no matter
how much I assure you,

551
01:28:58,429 --> 01:29:08,498
I won't be able to understand
your suffering.

552
01:29:12,377 --> 01:29:15,813
Wait a sec!
Bloody mother of...!

553
01:29:16,581 --> 01:29:18,549
What a brainwave, Sir Langda!

554
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:24,987
Why don't you hunt down Kichlu
instead of me?!

555
01:29:27,025 --> 01:29:30,153
Just drop him in Omi's lap.

556
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:38,831
Kichlu's gone underground, but if
you wish, you can get to him in a flash.

557
01:29:40,538 --> 01:29:42,028
Ask how?

558
01:29:42,307 --> 01:29:44,502
Ask how?!
- How?

559
01:29:45,009 --> 01:29:47,307
That Billo Chamanbahar of yours...

560
01:29:47,946 --> 01:29:50,176
She's the ace private dick of our trade.

561
01:29:55,153 --> 01:29:58,020
Had bought it for Indu,
but you gift it to Billo.

562
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:05,359
But this looks very expensive, brother?

563
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:08,862
If it can help a friend,
its worth is priceless!

564
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:13,534
Brother Langda...
you are a true friend...

565
01:30:17,575 --> 01:30:21,534
Come come... Don't be shy!

566
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:25,349
Kesu doesn't hold anything to heart,
likes giving it on the face.

567
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:33,880
Will you have a small one?

568
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:36,889
Moron! Forgotten that
day's thrashing or what?

569
01:30:38,296 --> 01:30:42,392
But what do we do about the wedding cards?
- Rajju will hand them out.

570
01:30:46,604 --> 01:30:48,572
Won't you, pretty polly?

571
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:54,901
And this won't be the first time
you'd be doing it... eh...!

572
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,911
The sun is going to rise
from the south tomorrow.

573
01:31:07,892 --> 01:31:09,860
Why so?

574
01:31:11,262 --> 01:31:18,862
First you took me to the multiplex...
bought me popcorn and lunch,

575
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,868
Then ice cream at the lake...
topped with a walk on the mall road.

576
01:31:24,242 --> 01:31:29,339
Its time to call it a night
yet you're not dragging me to bed...

577
01:31:30,648 --> 01:31:32,548
What's the big idea?

578
01:31:37,989 --> 01:31:39,957
I'm tired Billo.

579
01:31:43,061 --> 01:31:44,892
I've tired you out... no?

580
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:50,399
Nope... its my loneliness...

581
01:31:58,076 --> 01:32:00,044
You haven't answered me yet.

582
01:32:03,381 --> 01:32:04,575
What?

583
01:32:09,153 --> 01:32:11,018
Will you marry me?

584
01:32:19,849 --> 01:32:22,977
Are you nuts?!
All this marriage talk!

585
01:32:23,886 --> 01:32:26,480
Remember the saying 'Horses without reins
don't get lassoed easily!'.

586
01:32:27,256 --> 01:32:34,162
This is not a joke Billo...
I'm tired of all this straying.

587
01:32:35,698 --> 01:32:39,498
It all seems futile.
Just want to settle down with you now.

588
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:50,045
Got something for ya...

589
01:32:57,553 --> 01:33:01,011
Still don't quite get it...

590
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:08,018
Anyway, you've managed to impress me.

591
01:33:13,569 --> 01:33:14,536
Swine!

592
01:33:16,705 --> 01:33:18,468
My adorable swine!

593
01:33:20,709 --> 01:33:23,007
At least now tell me
what your scheme is?!

594
01:33:29,251 --> 01:33:36,987
"My tongue longs to taste the spice...
The spice of your love!"

595
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:15,528
"Lover I can never get enough...
The spice of your love!"

596
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:06,505
"They all tease me...
this gang of rakish cops."

597
01:35:06,715 --> 01:35:12,017
"They spoil me with their gifts...
the grocers on my street."

598
01:35:13,055 --> 01:35:17,788
"Big spender... spend a penny on me."

599
01:35:18,494 --> 01:35:22,794
"A sweet lick of honey from your fingers...
Grant me."

600
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:29,460
"Your spice leaves me gasping...
smoldering me to death."

601
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:49,484
"I spent the night craving...
The spice of your love!"

602
01:36:16,552 --> 01:36:24,459
"My brute... your breath
tunes me up like a flute."

603
01:36:33,302 --> 01:36:40,208
"Your passion can make me
do anything that you can imagine."

604
01:36:48,183 --> 01:36:50,481
"At times they sip from your eyes...

605
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:53,981
Later they want to drink
from your lips."

606
01:36:56,692 --> 01:37:02,494
"Sometimes it feels nice to die...
Sometimes its too painful to live."

607
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:13,506
"I toss and turn all night. Is that
my lover who tiptoes to my bedside?"

608
01:37:15,844 --> 01:37:20,907
Your spice leaves me gasping...
smoldering me to death.

609
01:37:36,165 --> 01:37:43,970
"My lover... let me have a bit
The spice of your love!"

610
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:34,448
Lets go, bro!

611
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:37,516
Lets go!

612
01:39:37,686 --> 01:39:39,654
Take Billo and vanish
for a day or two!

613
01:39:40,255 --> 01:39:42,450
We'll meet directly
at the village for the wedding.

614
01:39:45,727 --> 01:39:47,456
2 am in the morning?

615
01:39:47,663 --> 01:39:50,461
Ya man... middle of the bloody night!

616
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:52,657
Tring Tring... Tring Tring...

617
01:39:53,502 --> 01:39:57,461
I immediately went for my gun...
but the 'General' promptly stops me!

618
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:03,945
Smiling wickedly,
he says "It must be Billo"

619
01:40:05,247 --> 01:40:07,977
And lo and behold! The doors open.

620
01:40:08,183 --> 01:40:14,486
Enters a fuming Billo Chamanbahar...
strung like Lord Rama's bow!

621
01:40:15,324 --> 01:40:19,784
On seeing her temper, I immediately tucked
my head in and pretended to be asleep.

622
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,100
Somebody come and pump this.

623
01:40:27,736 --> 01:40:30,432
But as my good luck would have it,
there was a hole in the quilt.

624
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:36,106
Now I'm human after all...
and a little perverted at that.

625
01:40:39,815 --> 01:40:41,442
It was a cold winter night!

626
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:43,447
Kesu starts getting all horny
but Billo doesn't even let him peck her!

627
01:40:46,488 --> 01:40:48,456
Kesu then takes out this glittering
jewel from the box...

628
01:40:49,491 --> 01:40:51,459
this sparkling gorgeous waistband!

629
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:56,962
Glittering gold jewels!
Never seen anything so beautiful!

630
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:59,463
No way?
- Yeah...!

631
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:06,971
The way the waistband glowed in the dark,
you'd never need a lamp again in your life!

632
01:41:07,175 --> 01:41:09,006
Then?
- What do you think then?!

633
01:41:09,177 --> 01:41:11,475
The waistband was all
she was left wearing!

634
01:41:11,847 --> 01:41:13,815
Both sang nonstop duets till the morning!

635
01:41:14,016 --> 01:41:15,984
Creak! Creak!

636
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:03,457
Forgive Kesu!

637
01:42:03,665 --> 01:42:06,463
I called for Kesu and
thankfully he got me here.

638
01:42:07,502 --> 01:42:09,970
Kesu gets his pardon in 5 weeks!

639
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:19,969
What took you so long?

640
01:42:24,519 --> 01:42:26,487
I had been waiting for you...

641
01:42:28,824 --> 01:42:30,815
Why weren't you taking my calls?

642
01:42:37,265 --> 01:42:40,496
It was on silent mode... sorry...

643
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,839
Want some dinner?
- No!

644
01:42:46,808 --> 01:42:48,833
I'll go get some water.

645
01:42:51,546 --> 01:42:53,514
What happened?

646
01:42:54,883 --> 01:42:56,851
Where is the waistband?

647
01:42:58,086 --> 01:42:59,178
Sorry?

648
01:43:03,892 --> 01:43:05,519
The waistband!

649
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:09,029
Oh... must be lying around here...

650
01:43:10,565 --> 01:43:12,863
Here or elsewhere?!

651
01:43:14,036 --> 01:43:16,004
Must be in the house somewhere.

652
01:43:17,172 --> 01:43:19,640
Fine. Go put it on.

653
01:43:24,646 --> 01:43:26,637
Don't be naughty now!
Wait till the wedding.

654
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:30,480
I asked you to go put it on!

655
01:43:34,523 --> 01:43:37,651
And I... asked you to wait
till the wedding!

656
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:41,487
Now... means now... dammit!

657
01:44:02,884 --> 01:44:06,012
Haven't you kept the token
of my love real carefully?!

658
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:11,191
Maybe the chest gobbled
it up or was it the famished almirah?

659
01:44:17,966 --> 01:44:22,130
A generations old heirloom, and it
takes you precisely three days to lose it!

660
01:44:32,514 --> 01:44:34,982
Sure you haven't gifted it away?

661
01:44:38,687 --> 01:44:40,985
Who in the world
will I gift it to... Omkara?

662
01:44:44,192 --> 01:44:46,160
Who do I have besides you anyway?

663
01:44:53,935 --> 01:44:56,563
Have left my whole world to be with you!

664
01:45:08,083 --> 01:45:16,047
"The wood burns into charred coal...

665
01:45:30,906 --> 01:45:38,870
"My heart burns into emptiness."

666
01:45:41,516 --> 01:45:46,476
"Don't burn my heart away...

667
01:45:49,057 --> 01:45:52,823
"Don't pawn my heart away."

668
01:46:13,848 --> 01:46:19,809
Now what?!
The sun's also started getting up late!

669
01:46:24,693 --> 01:46:28,857
Not bad! Looks like someone
didn't get any rest all night!

670
01:46:33,301 --> 01:46:36,964
Save up some of that passion
for your wedding night, my princess!

671
01:46:41,042 --> 01:46:43,010
What happened now?!

672
01:46:46,248 --> 01:46:48,148
Speak up!

673
01:46:52,854 --> 01:46:55,982
If you keep crying like this,
you'll flood the whole village!

674
01:46:57,692 --> 01:47:03,494
Oh! Missing your papa... are you?

675
01:47:05,967 --> 01:47:07,935
Sober up now dodo!

676
01:47:09,271 --> 01:47:11,239
I'll take care of you.

677
01:47:11,873 --> 01:47:14,501
I'll be your pa, ma, bro, sis...

678
01:47:16,077 --> 01:47:18,443
everything rolled into one...
now stop crying!

679
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,446
What's this now?!

680
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:27,450
Did you fall somewhere?

681
01:47:29,924 --> 01:47:31,892
Did Omi hit...?!

682
01:47:37,532 --> 01:47:39,796
You just wait here!
That sonuvabitch...!

683
01:47:42,971 --> 01:47:45,462
Hit me out of love...

684
01:47:49,811 --> 01:47:53,474
I'll tell you a little secret.

685
01:47:55,517 --> 01:48:02,980
My grandma always told me to keep
these men slightly hungry.

686
01:48:06,795 --> 01:48:12,825
Else the day they get satisfied, they'll
puke you out like nobody's business!

687
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,931
Got that!

688
01:48:18,473 --> 01:48:24,434
Now... that's a rare smile in this weather!
About time! Forever thirsty... this guy!

689
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:24,438
It's Babulal!

690
01:49:38,486 --> 01:49:42,445
Where's he going running off to now?

691
01:49:42,657 --> 01:49:48,960
It's inauspicious to leave
in the middle of the ceremony son...

692
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:01,140
It burns me up!

693
01:50:02,243 --> 01:50:06,475
Ooh! Aah! It burns me up!

694
01:50:07,248 --> 01:50:11,810
The train's left the station.
Indore Singh's in the fourth wagon...

695
01:50:15,056 --> 01:50:16,956
Will you drink some?

696
01:50:19,928 --> 01:50:22,419
What's Kesu up to nowadays?

697
01:50:23,598 --> 01:50:24,792
God only knows!

698
01:50:24,966 --> 01:50:28,766
Every time you call him,
his phone is permanently out of LBW...

699
01:50:31,606 --> 01:50:33,574
But Dolly will surely know
his whereabouts.

700
01:50:34,642 --> 01:50:36,940
They are constantly in touch
over the phone.

701
01:50:40,215 --> 01:50:41,443
Langda!

702
01:50:43,218 --> 01:50:44,947
Yes brother.

703
01:50:46,821 --> 01:50:48,812
Will you tell me the truth?

704
01:50:50,492 --> 01:50:54,451
Ya bro, of course I will!

705
01:50:56,498 --> 01:51:00,457
I want a clear-cut yes or no.

706
01:51:01,836 --> 01:51:03,963
Of course! Please to ask!

707
01:51:08,543 --> 01:51:10,841
Is there anything going on
between Kesu and Dolly?

708
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:20,918
May my tongue fall off
before I utter another word!

709
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:25,923
Yes or no?

710
01:51:27,996 --> 01:51:29,691
I regard you more than my life...
forgive me...

711
01:51:29,864 --> 01:51:31,991
Yes or no?!

712
01:51:34,869 --> 01:51:37,429
Don't be so cold blooded
with your own brother.

713
01:51:39,908 --> 01:51:42,172
Yes or no?

714
01:53:46,701 --> 01:53:48,669
Game, set and match!

715
01:53:50,738 --> 01:53:52,501
Let's leave!

716
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,009
Yes or no?

717
01:54:07,555 --> 01:54:09,523
Yes or no?!

718
01:54:12,927 --> 01:54:18,456
Yes or no?!

719
01:54:19,233 --> 01:54:20,461
No...!

720
01:54:32,046 --> 01:54:35,140
That's what you wanted to hear?! No!

721
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:42,216
Do you have the courage
to hear the truth?

722
01:54:46,594 --> 01:54:48,562
What truth do you want to know?

723
01:54:49,530 --> 01:54:52,829
That during the Kichlu episode,
when I stayed over at Kesu's house...

724
01:54:53,935 --> 01:54:57,496
I heard him mutter in his sleep

725
01:54:57,705 --> 01:55:02,506
"Dolly... if our love has to live,

726
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:06,502
we'll have to hide it
from the entire world."

727
01:55:14,956 --> 01:55:17,857
Was there any other witness there?

728
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,120
No!?

729
01:55:26,667 --> 01:55:28,965
When you see your dreams...
you see it alone.

730
01:55:29,971 --> 01:55:32,462
When you hear your dreams...
you hear it alone.

731
01:55:33,908 --> 01:55:38,868
When I look into Dolly's eyes,
your entire Bible sounds phony!

732
01:55:40,982 --> 01:55:43,815
Now go get some proof before the
wedding... understood?!

733
01:55:44,919 --> 01:55:52,883
And if you don't, I'll wring
your corpse limp... Bastard!

734
01:56:05,673 --> 01:56:08,506
What the...?! Stop this racket!

735
01:56:29,931 --> 01:56:34,459
Who are you playing here for...
is it the Lord's wedding...?

736
01:56:36,504 --> 01:56:38,472
Take all your shebang
and come to our place...

737
01:56:38,973 --> 01:56:40,941
the girl's house.

738
01:56:47,815 --> 01:56:49,612
And isn't it Rip Van Winkle himself?

739
01:56:51,052 --> 01:56:53,020
What do you think you're up to, eh!?

740
01:56:53,688 --> 01:56:55,656
Come home... there's lots to be done.

741
01:56:59,827 --> 01:57:02,489
Get a bath and do something
about your lovely face!

742
01:57:03,798 --> 01:57:06,995
As if it wasn't pretty enough,
Sir's gone and had a facial in the city!

743
01:57:10,905 --> 01:57:12,839
Bitch and a half!

744
01:57:28,656 --> 01:57:30,453
The horse's here.

745
01:57:31,492 --> 01:57:33,460
Start dressing it up.

746
01:57:40,001 --> 01:57:46,133
When I woke up this morning, saw the word
'fool' tattooed on my forehead.

747
01:57:48,042 --> 01:57:53,981
Do what I say... else you'll find the word
'moron' tattooed tomorrow morning.

748
01:58:00,288 --> 01:58:02,483
"Don't you want Dolly... eh...?"

749
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:38,124
That's enough anger
for a lifetime Omi bro!

750
01:58:38,492 --> 01:58:41,950
Today you have to keep
your word and pardon me.

751
01:58:44,999 --> 01:58:48,958
Hey! Don't set up
the barbecue near the loo!

752
01:58:49,704 --> 01:58:54,471
Take it away...
who the hell's in charge here?

753
01:59:04,518 --> 01:59:05,485
Kesu?

754
01:59:05,953 --> 01:59:07,921
Kesu's not here. Who's on the line?
- Billo

755
01:59:08,856 --> 01:59:12,485
Billo ma'am!

756
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:15,820
Kesu's occupied right now.

757
01:59:16,197 --> 01:59:17,926
Call him on the phone

758
01:59:18,132 --> 01:59:21,101
I'm sorry... we're not allowed
to disturb him.

759
01:59:21,469 --> 01:59:23,437
I said just call him

760
01:59:24,205 --> 01:59:26,435
As I've already explained,
we're not allowed inside.

761
01:59:26,807 --> 01:59:28,934
The room is locked tight.

762
01:59:33,647 --> 01:59:35,444
Who's there with him?

763
01:59:38,019 --> 01:59:42,922
Can't tell you the truth.
And my lies won't assure you.

764
01:59:44,825 --> 01:59:50,457
Hello Hello... any message?

765
02:00:57,832 --> 02:01:00,960
Don't be a fool!
It's just a bogus omen.

766
02:01:02,703 --> 02:01:06,799
Don't let it bother you...
stop crying!

767
02:01:08,008 --> 02:01:10,476
It's not nice to be mourning
on your wedding day.

768
02:01:11,879 --> 02:01:13,847
Lets get you dressed now.

769
02:01:15,583 --> 02:01:17,483
Will you get ready now
or should I call Omkara?

770
02:01:18,986 --> 02:01:20,920
Should I?!

771
02:01:22,823 --> 02:01:24,791
Call him if you please!

772
02:01:25,493 --> 02:01:29,759
At least I'll get to know what is the
grave sin that I've committed?

773
02:01:31,665 --> 02:01:36,432
This is not the same Omkara for whom
I gave up home and hearth.

774
02:01:38,873 --> 02:01:42,832
My Omkara used to shield me
in his palms like a precious petal.

775
02:01:48,649 --> 02:01:50,446
What happened... but?

776
02:01:51,652 --> 02:01:55,588
I don't know...
he's always annoyed at me

777
02:01:57,691 --> 02:02:00,455
That day I lied that
he'd hurt me out of love.

778
02:02:05,699 --> 02:02:08,463
He hit me because
I misplaced something.

779
02:02:10,638 --> 02:02:11,696
What thing?

780
02:02:11,906 --> 02:02:16,138
Whatever it is, you don't
have right to hit anyone!

781
02:02:19,847 --> 02:02:23,146
You once lost Golu at the fair!
Did I utter a word?

782
02:02:29,023 --> 02:02:31,491
It's time I had a word with him.

783
02:02:33,527 --> 02:02:35,495
Don't worry

784
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:38,498
Look here dodo!

785
02:02:38,899 --> 02:02:41,993
Men and women have always
had a pan and ladle equation.

786
02:02:42,937 --> 02:02:47,499
Alone, they stay miserable...
and together, they make one helluva racket!

787
02:02:48,075 --> 02:02:51,511
Cling Clang Cling Clang!

788
02:02:54,548 --> 02:02:56,516
Not Bad!

789
02:02:57,985 --> 02:03:00,510
Now... that's a rare smile in this weather!

790
02:03:16,036 --> 02:03:18,129
For our silver jubilee anniversary,

791
02:03:18,505 --> 02:03:23,135
I took my wife to Timbuktu!
- Timbuktu?!

792
02:03:24,511 --> 02:03:26,638
What're you planning now
for the 50th year celebrations?

793
02:03:27,314 --> 02:03:29,475
Thinking of getting her back from Timbuktu!

794
02:03:35,189 --> 02:03:37,089
Now it's my turn to crack one.

795
02:03:37,291 --> 02:03:39,486
Now that's a joke in itself!

796
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:46,158
There was this man who once got married.

797
02:03:49,903 --> 02:03:50,995
Then?

798
02:03:52,773 --> 02:03:54,502
That was the end of it.

799
02:04:03,717 --> 02:04:08,518
You can lie to the whole world but
I don't get fooled that easy.

800
02:04:11,558 --> 02:04:14,186
Your eyes give it away...

801
02:04:17,698 --> 02:04:19,666
Won't share it with your own sister?

802
02:04:21,235 --> 02:04:23,465
What demons are you
carrying around in your head?

803
02:04:34,581 --> 02:04:37,982
Her father's voice keeps ringing
in my ears all the time...

804
02:04:44,525 --> 02:04:50,486
"She who can dupe her own father
will never be anyone's to claim"

805
02:04:58,539 --> 02:05:01,508
Two faced character... no?

806
02:05:07,948 --> 02:05:11,509
When the scriptures themselves
have sullied women,

807
02:05:14,755 --> 02:05:17,451
who can blame mere mortals
like you, brother?

808
02:05:20,994 --> 02:05:28,457
We renounce our homes and walk into
your lives with bare empty hands.

809
02:05:36,176 --> 02:05:38,474
But even after the holy fires
approve us,

810
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:43,481
we're regarded disloyal
sooner than loyal.

811
02:05:48,889 --> 02:05:50,857
There's time yet, brother!

812
02:05:54,862 --> 02:06:00,823
If you have the slightest of doubts,
please do not stoop to attend the marriage!

813
02:06:03,537 --> 02:06:06,506
We'll take care of Dolly...
you don't worry about her fate.

814
02:06:35,502 --> 02:06:40,838
If I don't get the proof I'll make sure
he never misses his father.

815
02:09:44,157 --> 02:09:45,454
Ya?

816
02:09:45,659 --> 02:09:47,627
Billo's looking for you in the village.

817
02:09:52,499 --> 02:09:56,458
At this hour?
- Ya... she seems to be in one foul mood.

818
02:09:57,838 --> 02:09:59,806
I sent her to Langda bro.

819
02:10:01,508 --> 02:10:03,476
I think you should call him.

820
02:10:13,987 --> 02:10:16,751
Ya Kesu?
- Is Billo around?

821
02:10:16,990 --> 02:10:18,958
Ya she's upstairs.

822
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:24,426
Your sweetheart's
not looking very happy, I fear.

823
02:10:24,731 --> 02:10:27,757
God knows why
the bitch's always in heat?!

824
02:10:28,669 --> 02:10:30,762
This blasted affair!

825
02:10:31,605 --> 02:10:33,903
What affair?

826
02:10:35,208 --> 02:10:39,110
This 'love affair'
is a bloody bore!

827
02:10:40,147 --> 02:10:43,947
The 'wham bang' days
were much better!

828
02:10:44,951 --> 02:10:50,947
If she's so turned on before the wedding,
imagine how she'll devour me after?

829
02:10:52,826 --> 02:10:59,789
I told her we should avoid doing it
on the wedding night... but no luck!

830
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:08,808
You here?!

831
02:11:09,509 --> 02:11:11,477
Who are you flirting with...
this late at night?

832
02:11:13,013 --> 02:11:15,846
Don't you dare disconnect!
Finish your damn love chat!

833
02:11:16,049 --> 02:11:17,744
You're misunderstanding the whole thing.

834
02:11:17,984 --> 02:11:23,422
Ya right! I've understood you enough!
You are a compulsive womanizer!

835
02:11:24,458 --> 02:11:27,427
Given a chance, you'd take
Your own mother to bed!

836
02:11:27,728 --> 02:11:30,424
That'll be enough!
Shut your mouth!

837
02:11:32,265 --> 02:11:36,599
Whose wife did you strip this away from?
- Billo... listen to me for a minute!

838
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:38,557
Sorry honey... we're finished!

839
02:12:41,268 --> 02:12:42,895
Don't get crazy, girl!

840
02:12:43,537 --> 02:12:47,496
Wait... listen up please!

841
02:12:50,210 --> 02:12:52,838
Do we have to do this?

842
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:16,198
Lets go now, please!

843
02:13:20,841 --> 02:13:25,471
Won't you wait for dessert, my friend?

844
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:33,850
Go stiff him a couple from point blank,

845
02:13:34,988 --> 02:13:38,151
else the 'ex-General'
will suffer all night.

846
02:13:41,995 --> 02:13:43,826
Go Champ!

847
02:14:18,832 --> 02:14:20,800
Your lover's history!

848
02:14:21,868 --> 02:14:22,960
What?

849
02:14:23,703 --> 02:14:25,466
Your lover...

850
02:14:27,841 --> 02:14:29,468
Kesu...

851
02:14:30,710 --> 02:14:33,474
Poor soul couldn't
even carry your keepsake.

852
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:39,018
Where did you get this
blasted thing?

853
02:14:49,896 --> 02:14:52,490
Hey meanie!

854
02:14:55,902 --> 02:14:57,870
Stop play acting now.

855
02:15:02,075 --> 02:15:04,043
You've been stripped naked.

856
02:15:11,251 --> 02:15:13,219
Your 'innocence' makes me want to puke.

857
02:15:24,831 --> 02:15:26,799
Since when have you been
warming Kesu's loins?

858
02:15:34,174 --> 02:15:42,138
OK... at least tell me when was
the first time you slept with him?

859
02:15:44,784 --> 02:15:47,150
Just for the record?
Are you carrying his baby by any chance?

860
02:15:55,662 --> 02:16:01,828
See... the deal is - accept it,
I'll spare you your life.

861
02:16:16,049 --> 02:16:18,779
Thanks for the offer but...

862
02:16:22,822 --> 02:16:24,790
you are free to take my life.

863
02:16:39,039 --> 02:16:41,007
Did I lack anything?

864
02:16:42,509 --> 02:16:43,476
Huh?

865
02:18:49,569 --> 02:18:52,538
Omi bro!

866
02:18:56,176 --> 02:18:59,145
Omi bro! There's been a lot of bloodshed,
please rush!

867
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:01,647
Omi brother... are you listening?!

868
02:19:38,151 --> 02:19:40,779
She looks so childlike in her sleep...

869
02:19:45,525 --> 02:19:51,953
She who can dupe her own father
will never be anyone's to claim.

870
02:20:02,575 --> 02:20:04,509
Two faced character!

871
02:20:18,658 --> 02:20:20,592
I stole this.

872
02:21:04,971 --> 02:21:06,461
Brother Omi!

873
02:21:20,153 --> 02:21:21,745
Go home.

874
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:25,958
Go home you bitch!

875
02:21:26,993 --> 02:21:28,858
Didn't you hear me... whore?!

876
02:21:29,028 --> 02:21:30,086
Langda!

877
02:21:47,814 --> 02:21:49,441
She's lying Omi bro...

878
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:54,219
God knows why she wants me dead!

879
02:21:55,655 --> 02:21:57,623
Seems she too is having an affair...

880
02:22:01,494 --> 02:22:03,962
I regard you more than God!
I'd never...

881
02:22:17,677 --> 02:22:20,976
Think what you must.

882
02:22:23,583 --> 02:22:28,816
My truth and my lies have
all got blurred.

883
02:22:31,691 --> 02:22:36,993
Go shoot me in the head! Release me!

884
02:22:51,544 --> 02:22:53,512
Death will only help free your body...

885
02:22:56,015 --> 02:22:58,848
...but our souls are forever damned...

886
02:23:02,722 --> 02:23:08,524
We won't find redemption...
not in this life!

887
02:24:31,511 --> 02:24:36,471
"Wake up little princess!"

888
02:24:36,849 --> 02:24:40,808
Your eyes like sweet petals!

889
02:24:42,188 --> 02:24:47,148
"Eyes that hold me in their spell."

890
02:24:47,693 --> 02:24:51,493
"May I never be away
from their sight!"

891
02:24:52,532 --> 02:25:00,496
"My little princess...
my sleeping doll wake up."

892
02:25:06,546 --> 02:25:11,506
"Wake up little princess!"

893
02:25:11,784 --> 02:25:15,515
"Your eyes like sweet petals!"

894
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:35,463
"The dawn blushes pink on your cheek"

895
02:25:38,511 --> 02:25:43,471
"Craving to caress you...
come now wake up...

896
02:25:46,719 --> 02:25:51,486
"Your sweet flesh beckons
Comes hither a bee to tickle you"

897
02:25:52,258 --> 02:25:56,490
"Come now my darling wake up."

898
02:25:57,530 --> 02:26:02,490
"Ask for your heart's desire
I give my word in blood"

899
02:26:02,868 --> 02:26:06,497
"Just for this once... open your eyes"

900
02:26:07,540 --> 02:26:14,503
"My little princess...
my sleeping doll wake up."

901
02:26:15,681 --> 02:26:20,778
"Wake up little princess!
Your eyes like sweet petals!"

902
02:26:40,506 --> 02:26:42,474
Open the door, Omi Bro!

903
02:26:56,689 --> 02:27:00,489
How did you ever think...?

904
02:27:07,900 --> 02:27:09,868
Hush now!

905
02:27:11,871 --> 02:27:13,839
One more word and its all over.

906
02:27:15,541 --> 02:27:22,447
Isn't it all over anyway?

907
02:27:39,298 --> 02:27:42,461
No, it isn't over yet.

908
02:27:44,704 --> 02:27:49,664
Forgotten how I pasted
the Army Guy in court?

909
02:27:53,045 --> 02:27:55,479
Bang on the temple... Boom!

910
02:27:57,516 --> 02:27:59,484
And our friend Indore Singh?

911
02:28:00,219 --> 02:28:04,815
Shoved the gun right
up his mouth and... Boom!

912
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:10,028
And Thakur?

913
02:28:11,530 --> 02:28:13,498
Right through his heart....

914
02:28:15,224 --> 02:30:30,444
