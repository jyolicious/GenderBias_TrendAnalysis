1
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:33,224
"Desires, thousands of them..."

2
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:45,634
"desires I could die for"

3
00:02:55,687 --> 00:03:02,649
"I had so many desires..."

4
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:14,671
"and yet, so few they were"

5
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,140
"Dear Gita, Calcutta was
awe-inspiring"

6
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:46,642
"I'm now back in Delhi,
my beliefs totally strengthened"

7
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:50,642
"We have to change the world.
And change it fundamentally"

8
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:56,823
"I always knew the facts, but when
I met some of the mothers..."

9
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,159
"and widows of thousands of students
who had sacrificed their lives..."

10
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:04,161
"during the Naxalite movement,
I felt completely humbled"

11
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:07,658
"They were the best and
the brightest of Bengal"

12
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,235
"But instead of taking
the comfortable roads...

13
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:14,372
"that their parents
had laid down for them..."

14
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:17,432
"they went down the dirt and
the muddy roads to the villages..."

15
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,776
"to end the vulgarity
of oppression"

16
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:29,177
"The violence of the oppressed
is right"

17
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,322
"The violence of the Oppressor
is wrong"

18
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:34,257
"And to hell with ethics"

19
00:04:34,724 --> 00:04:36,783
"I mean, weren't Bhagat Singh's
actions correct?"

20
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:41,221
"It made me think
of ourselves"

21
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:44,123
"I mean, who do we think
we are?"

22
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,802
"Strutting around, sprouting radical
jargon, a little politics..."

23
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,137
"some rock-n-roll...
but mostly shock value"

24
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,640
"Isn't it shameful that I,
Sidharth Tyebji..."

25
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:56,140
"son of a Muslim father and
a Hindu Bengali mother..."

26
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,279
"neither can speak
Urdu nor Bengali?"

27
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,644
"My parents did not give me the
one thing of value that they could"

28
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,682
"This has to change"

29
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:07,151
"Gita, I have now become
a card-holder of the Party"

30
00:05:07,722 --> 00:05:10,658
"Eventually, you must also.
More when you get back"

31
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,749
"Love - Sidharth"

32
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:36,781
"Dear Gita, first things first.
I still love you"

33
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:40,107
"I'm still stuck in Meerut because
the trains have been cancelled..."

34
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,118
"due to the Hindu-Muslim sibling
rivalry that has flared up again"

35
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,114
"This time it's not so bad.
Only 38 dead"

36
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:50,455
"Two of them were eaten by the
circus lion, when one rioteer..."

37
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,630
"chased his victim into
the lion's enclosure"

38
00:05:53,564 --> 00:05:55,532
"But most of the town
doesn't give a shit"

39
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:00,636
"An announcement:
The town is under curfew"

40
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,306
"Citizens are requested
to stay indoors"

41
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,473
"What really gets everyone here
excited is the news..."

42
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:10,806
"that the local hardware merchant's
daughter ran away with their cook"

43
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,572
"Some of the family members finally
caught him and put him in a pot..."

44
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,086
"and boiled him.
Just kidding; they only castrated him"

45
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,089
"This state of affairs
only worries my father..."

46
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:24,082
"thirty of his Gandhian colleagues,
seventy socialists..."

47
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:26,494
"and a hundred and two others
no end"

48
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,093
"But being worried is my
father's main profession"

49
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:31,629
"He should have been more
worried about us, though..."

50
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,598
"and we wouldn't have been stuck at
the lower-end of great middle-class"

51
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,765
Not now. Go away

52
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:45,099
"Which is why I can't understand
you rich kids playing..."

53
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,110
"the let's-change-the-world game"

54
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,605
"While you're looking for a way out,
I'm looking for a way in"

55
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:55,454
"Into your heart, I mean"

56
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,620
"See you soon.
Love - Vikram"

57
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,631
Is your hero through
Uncle...

58
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,542
Here's some yogurt for luck

59
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,237
Look after yourself

60
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:24,544
Don't worry. It'll be all right.
- It won't

61
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,409
But you concentrate
on your studies

62
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:29,075
Enough of this filial love!
Come on now

63
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:33,580
Move it. If anyone asks, say you're
dropping my nephew at the station

64
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,101
Father, I'm leaving.

65
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:55,107
Why enact this farce?
You know who started it all

66
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,777
If everyone shirks responsibility,
then God help us all

67
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,786
Go on, you're getting late.

68
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,453
Write to your mother as soon as
you reach Delhi

69
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,061
What does he want me to do? Become
a martyr and die in this shit-hole?

70
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,399
What's up? Your wife threw you out
early in the morning?

71
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,405
No, it's because you're
going to Delhi

72
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:34,068
So I thought why should I waste money
mailing this letter?

73
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,574
At least you'll deliver it,
safe and sound

74
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:41,576
Give this letter to Randhir bhaisahab.
Tell him everything is fine here.

75
00:08:57,134 --> 00:09:00,433
St. Stephen's College
New Delhi, 1969

76
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,552
Kiddo! Come on, pick up my bags.

77
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:30,387
Damn you, it's my room too.

78
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:32,464
You haven't even unpacked and
your guests have taken over

79
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:35,568
When you meet someone after a long
time you're supposed to say hello.

80
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,066
I can't even sit alone in my own room?

81
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:43,065
It'll do you more good to sit
with them than to jerk off.

82
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,067
They are Youth Congress...
lots of power, kiddo!

83
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,613
Randhir bhaisahab!
- Hey kiddo!

84
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,089
I've been scratching my balls,
waiting for the last two hours

85
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,588
Where have you been?
- The train was late...

86
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:04,558
Screw the train.
Hows everyone at home?

87
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,756
Fine. The riots are also under control.
- Screw that too

88
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,097
So, where's my letter?
- How did you know about it?

89
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:15,439
Back home, if you shit and don't wipe
your ass, the boss gets to know

90
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,436
Otherwise, he couldn't have
led a political party

91
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:21,109
And engineered the riots too?
- Balls

92
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:24,107
The boss hasn't budged from here
for the last nine days.

93
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:26,611
Now tell me, what's all this?

94
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,120
No Gandhi, no Nehru, no Subhash...?

95
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:35,191
And what's going on downstairs?

96
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:41,120
Some rock show,
your room-mate told me

97
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,133
Saw some weird-Iooking girls...

98
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,606
eminently screwable,
each one of them

99
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:04,147
Wow, what a jeep!

100
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,687
You like it?
- Yes

101
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:10,288
Keep it.

102
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:25,098
To all you fans of Jimi Hendrix
and Bob Dylan...

103
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:27,238
who fought against injustice
in their own country...

104
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:31,436
we want you to think, question.
Don't just listen, not even to us

105
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:36,614
But what would Daddy say?
- Tell Daddy life's not just fun.

106
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:38,646
Tell Daddy there's a famine in Bihar.

107
00:11:38,816 --> 00:11:40,681
Tell Daddy people are dying
in the countryside.

108
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,642
Tell him that he's
responsible for this.

109
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,345
Because he's a collaborator
in a state...

110
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:48,115
which is a state of big landlords
and bourgeois capitalists.

111
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,524
And tell Daddy that life's not just
about getting proper English education...

112
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,129
earning a fat salary
and loving one's parents

113
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:56,158
There are countries in this world...

114
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,459
where people have
established a new order.

115
00:11:58,835 --> 00:12:01,463
China... Vietnam... Telengana!

116
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:29,091
Once upon a time, a princess was
walking down the street all alone

117
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,230
Abandoned by her prince...

118
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:34,596
when a gallant knight rode up
to her on his royal steed.

119
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,766
He swept her off feet and
they rode into the sunset.

120
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:42,442
Not every story has a
happily ever after, Vikram.

121
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:46,101
Well, because every story
has its Sidharth, right?

122
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:50,104
Come on, I'll drop you

123
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:52,581
Your knight in shining armour
will escort you to the lion's lair

124
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:57,248
As long as you don't keep me
from the lion, Sir Knight.

125
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:17,067
Wow, and these guys are
supposed to be Marxists!

126
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:28,412
Ah... come on!

127
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:31,086
Join us for a drink.

128
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,419
No, I'll go upstairs and
meet Sidharth. I'll join you later.

129
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,086
I think I will also
leave in a little while

130
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:40,421
Listen, you have to drop me home!

131
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:10,123
If we are really convinced...

132
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,723
if we are really moved...

133
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:16,327
then let's go and take some
affirmative action.

134
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:19,727
If we want to make a change, we
must go and work in the villages.

135
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:23,068
Look at Castro and what he did
in Cuba

136
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,397
Cuba is small.
We're an enormous country

137
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:30,071
We have Probir-da here.
He has worked in villages all his life

138
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,735
Instead of letting him speak,
we're getting into this intellectual...

139
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,579
Probir da...

140
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,247
Gandhi understood the importance
of villages before much Mao

141
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:42,245
He said no revolution was possible
without organising the rural poor

142
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:44,449
But what social revolution
did he bring?

143
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:50,083
That's exactly why
our party has gone much further

144
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,597
Alongside the worker,
the rural poor must also be armed

145
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:57,759
Did we bring any changes in
those villages.

146
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:01,592
All that M.K. Gandhi did was to become
a guest of big Marwari businessman.

147
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:16,207
Don't you have anything
to say, Gita?

148
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,552
What can I say?
- Why?

149
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,386
I've lived all my life between
England and Delhi.

150
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:27,057
I've never been to a village leave alone
know anything about their problems

151
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:32,062
But you people seem to know
everything. So why ask me?

152
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,400
That's not the attitude to have

153
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,567
How will you ever learn
if you don't discuss...

154
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,442
Do you love me, Sidharth?

155
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:46,067
What?
- Just answer. Do you love me?

156
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,075
Yeah, sure.

157
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,818
Do you really love me?

158
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,083
I just said so.

159
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,089
Say it.

160
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:12,029
I love you.

161
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,034
Sorry.
- It's okay.

162
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:26,578
We're going to join the
University strike tomorrow

163
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,377
You're with us, aren't you?
- I think it's load of shit

164
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:31,553
I don't know what you're
trying to accomplish

165
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,051
We're not trying.
And even if doesn't work...

166
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:37,054
Sidharth says, it's worth it.
At least we're there...

167
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:43,055
Sidharth was born with a silver spoon
in his mouth. His father is an ex-judge.

168
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,534
He can afford to think
the way he does. We can't

169
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:52,069
Why are you so against him?
- I'm not against him

170
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,237
Personally I'm just worried about you;
you're too gullible

171
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:58,072
These guys have
their dads' connections

172
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,074
...and, there's your dad.

173
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:03,743
I appreciate your concern,
but I can take care of myself.

174
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,019
Sorry... sorry.

175
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:16,017
Forgiven?

176
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:20,756
Dad, that's Vikram.
He looked after me last night

177
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:23,501
Ask him in for a cup of coffee.

178
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:29,497
Come inside and have a cup of
good South Indian coffee

179
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,218
These are my uncles.

180
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,555
These are my aunts

181
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,059
Grandma!

182
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:09,066
Is he the one?
- No, grandma, he's not the one!

183
00:18:10,778 --> 00:18:15,477
Political parties are just
interested in getting our votes.

184
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:19,008
They have become pimps
for the management

185
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,018
And let me warn you about one thing

186
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,521
Many parties attach the word
"Socialist" to their names

187
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,522
but that doesn't make them socialist

188
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:32,360
Even Hitler's party was called the
Nationalist Socialist Party

189
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,366
Who's Hitler?
- Who knows? Wasn't from my village

190
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:40,431
See, they don't understand
what's happening here...

191
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:47,034
Until the workers are organised...

192
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:54,210
The management is trying to
intimidate us with strong-arm tactics!

193
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,384
Let's get out of here!

194
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,058
I have to leave.
- Where are you going?

195
00:19:07,765 --> 00:19:09,392
I'll tell you later

196
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,675
Rajan, take the bag.
Leave!

197
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:35,353
Get out of here!

198
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,355
This is preposterous!

199
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:41,187
Only I have a right to question
whom my son brings home

200
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:45,166
And who the hell are you to
talk about my son's character?

201
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,533
It looks ridiculous coming from
people like... anyway, never mind

202
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,104
We've taken enough shit
from you, sir

203
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:55,039
We had information that your son
was hiding anti-social elements

204
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:56,706
We have a search warrant

205
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:59,375
If you still have a problem,
talk to my superiors

206
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,386
What is it?

207
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,590
We've got to search the place.
- Go ahead

208
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,224
Come

209
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:32,500
This son of a bitch
is a total degenerate.

210
00:20:32,676 --> 00:20:34,542
That's an understatement.

211
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:42,082
The jerk's got it all.
- And here we are tickling our balls.

212
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,417
Lucky bastard!

213
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:01,429
Thanks... for stopping the cops.

214
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,604
It's getting chilly, why don't
you take your grandmother inside?

215
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:07,575
She insists on sleeping
in the open

216
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,174
It's an old habit

217
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,710
In her father's house,
the kids always slept on the terrace

218
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,053
What will she do when you leave?

219
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:33,061
So are you serious
about this Bihar thing?

220
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:37,269
I'm serious about going
to Bihar... yes

221
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:40,070
Of all the stupid...!

222
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:43,734
Sorry.

223
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,173
Can I ask, why?

224
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:55,305
You mean you don't know why?
- No, educate me

225
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,472
Because I'm sick of people like you who
sit and pontificate about India...

226
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,973
its problems... the oppressive political
and social systems and...

227
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:08,576
then do nothing about it

228
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:12,907
So you have faith in an ideology
that talks of annihilation...

229
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,236
and the murder of people as an
acceptable way of changing the system?

230
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:21,450
What gives you that right?

231
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:29,017
I met a couple of Englishmen

232
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:31,408
They say a revolution in our country
is just not possible

233
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,609
I told them to come with us
to Calcutta...

234
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,612
where thousands of students have
laid down their lives

235
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:37,920
It's amazing how ignorant they are

236
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:41,249
They'll get a shock when
they see that forty boys come...

237
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:44,422
from a single hamlet in Bihar.
- I talked to the student leader

238
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:47,252
He said that around 15 students
are coming from his college

239
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,922
It's a pity.
- Why?

240
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,921
There's just eight of us.
- So what?

241
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,059
Comrades, Prahlad called...
- Where is he?

242
00:22:56,094 --> 00:22:58,583
He said he's not going...
- What do you mean?

243
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:02,926
The upper-class bastard!
- Look man, things are not easy

244
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:05,254
I mean this whole business
about the cops...

245
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:08,596
Why are you justifying that punk?
- Look, I'm also not going. Okay?

246
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,458
There's this West Indian poet
coming to the British Council...

247
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,188
What...? What?

248
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,853
If my brother finds out I'm going
to Calcutta, I'll get screwed!

249
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,861
So this's the level of your commitment?
- This thing is too dangerous, man!

250
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:22,533
I have to think about my future!

251
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,194
What about documenting our
struggle and all that?

252
00:23:29,936 --> 00:23:31,870
Sidharth, even I'm not going

253
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,530
I know you'll be very upset,
but my parents...

254
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:38,403
Sidharth I'm not going!
- It's okay

255
00:23:38,572 --> 00:23:41,266
Probir-da, we don't need these guys.
Prahlad, Amit... we don't need them

256
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,530
Police!

257
00:24:41,591 --> 00:24:43,820
Hey Vikram.
I just got my U.S. Visa

258
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:48,322
Hey Pablo...
- Got into Brooks, still photography

259
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:51,989
Take care

260
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,161
This is Vikram Malhotra
speaking, sir

261
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:59,828
I'm a friend of Mehmood
Tyebji's son Sidharth

262
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,154
Could you do me a favour, sir?
I wish to speak to the Finance Minister

263
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:09,327
Sidharth would have himself called,
but he's not well

264
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:12,162
Only for five minutes...?
Yes, I'll hold

265
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,403
Hey Sidharth, I'm sorry

266
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:31,971
I wanted to be with you all

267
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:35,772
I still believe in the ideology

268
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:40,263
But my dad's just too rich...
I can't give up all this, can I?

269
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:00,773
So you're leaving on the 17th?
- Yes

270
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,709
I have just applied for my M.A.

271
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:19,042
Good. I mean, that's the
right course for you

272
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:21,179
Good, yes

273
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:27,721
We might not see each other
for some time

274
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:29,715
Maybe

275
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,056
Gita...

276
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:45,160
sweetheart, I'll be back
in about six months time...

277
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:48,358
it's not the end of the world, is it?

278
00:26:52,496 --> 00:26:53,724
No

279
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,197
It's not the end of the world

280
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:10,059
May I have the next dance with you?
- Sure

281
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:13,618
"I'm crazed at heart,
I've lost all sense of reason"

282
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:18,013
"It wakes all night,
my crazed heart"

283
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:35,022
"A thousand desires..."

284
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:44,618
"desires I could die for"

285
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:51,627
"So many desires I had..."

286
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,622
"and yet, so few they were"

287
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:31,566
"My crazed heart,
it won't be placated with you..."

288
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,970
"what does it seek...?"

289
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:06,580
"Dear Gita..."

290
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:09,827
"You'll probably tear this letter
without reading it"

291
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:13,338
"But you have to let me
try and explain myself"

292
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,856
"I know I said I'd be back in
six months and then disappeared"

293
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,877
"But you must realise that
when I left for Bhojpur..."

294
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:24,956
"I didn't really know what
I was getting into"

295
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:28,898
"Bhojpur and Delhi are not separated
merely by a thousand miles..."

296
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:31,448
"but also five thousand years"

297
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:36,429
"You must have heard of exploitation,
disease, lawlessness and apathy"

298
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,380
"There's all that here and much more"

299
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:42,685
"But once you've been here and seen
the despair, you cannot leave"

300
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:45,036
For how long are you going to
take this shit from the landlords?

301
00:30:45,204 --> 00:30:47,508
You can't even sit in their presence
even if you are about to collapse

302
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,190
Raping your womenfolk
is their birthright

303
00:30:50,357 --> 00:30:52,993
"Here, I am on the run.
An extremist in the eyes of the law"

304
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:55,343
"Member of a banned party attempting
to galvanise a people..."

305
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:57,016
"subjugated for centuries"

306
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:06,384
Raise the Red Flag! It's a fight not
just for land, but for our dignity!

307
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:10,398
"It's really complicated.
Let me try and explain"

308
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:14,179
"One day the untouchables in
the village were up in arms"

309
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:17,528
"The landlord's son had raped
one of their girls"

310
00:31:18,472 --> 00:31:21,541
All right, maybe my son
has made a mistake

311
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:24,054
So what are you going to do?
Kill him?

312
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:26,566
"They had all gathered outside the
landlord's house..."

313
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:28,744
"to chop off his balls"

314
00:31:34,536 --> 00:31:36,235
"The feeling was overwhelming"

315
00:31:36,377 --> 00:31:39,616
"To my naive mind it seemed
the revolution was at hand"

316
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:45,609
"Then suddenly, the cursed landlord
had a heart-attack"

317
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,484
Are you okay, saheb?
- My chest is hurting very badly...

318
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:50,599
What happened father?
- Shut up, you bastard

319
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,704
This is all your fault

320
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:55,181
"The lower-caste villagers who had been
screaming for his blood a minute ago..."

321
00:31:55,352 --> 00:31:58,854
"were suddenly overcome by some
ancient dutiful urge to save him"

322
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:03,211
"After all, he and his family had been
their lords and masters for centuries"

323
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,723
"So, a jeep was despatched
to summon a doctor"

324
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:10,569
"Being lower-caste, the only doctor
they knew was also a lower-caste"

325
00:32:13,358 --> 00:32:15,193
"So here's the problem"

326
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:18,671
"The landlord's son did not want a
lower-caste doctor touching his father"

327
00:32:18,913 --> 00:32:21,548
"But the father who was dying,
didn't give a damn"

328
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:25,236
"At that moment, he'd have eaten
goat-shit if the doctor asked him to"

329
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,990
"This strange compassion of the
villagers towards their oppressor..."

330
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,469
"in his moment of need,
taught me something"

331
00:32:35,045 --> 00:32:37,613
"What...?
I'm still trying to decipher"

332
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:44,310
"Please try to understand.
There's no place for you here"

333
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:47,487
"Our paths must necessarily
be different, Gita"

334
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:53,483
"I'll write again, if you do
- Sidharth"

335
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:14,701
New Delhi, 1973

336
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:43,481
I spoke to Daddy about your idea
about the hotel deal

337
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:45,987
He thinks it's a waste of time.
- It's not

338
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:48,500
Converting an old palace into
a hotel is a great idea.

339
00:33:49,675 --> 00:33:51,513
So screw what Daddy thinks

340
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:53,521
It's the deal of the year
if I can clinch it

341
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh, shit!
- What happened?

342
00:33:58,043 --> 00:34:00,542
I just remembered... I've got a
meeting with these Bombay builders

343
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:05,038
And I've given my car for repairs
- That's okay. You can keep the Chevy

344
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:07,578
Dad's going off tomorrow
so the Mercedes is there

345
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,697
Shall we go to Shimla some day?

346
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:15,877
Just you and me

347
00:34:29,872 --> 00:34:31,606
What happened?
Someone died?

348
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:34,619
Your girl ran away...?

349
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,009
What are you giving
cheques like that for?

350
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:50,186
Where is the money
going to come from?

351
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:52,189
We've already paid the prince
50,000 rupees...

352
00:34:52,362 --> 00:34:55,031
to convince his dad about the deal.
But he's not calling!

353
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,883
We're doomed... we're finished!

354
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,739
You worry too much

355
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:07,413
Sometimes, there's nothing to do
but wait for the phone to ring

356
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:10,765
This phone has not rung
for the past two weeks

357
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:13,709
It'll ring, it'll ring
- Yeah? When?

358
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:18,892
It'll ring now...

359
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,739
Just count to three and
this phone will ring

360
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:26,260
One...

361
00:35:27,804 --> 00:35:29,104
two...

362
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:33,961
three

363
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:44,827
If the mountain doesn't
come to Malhotra...

364
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,012
Malhotra goes to the mountain

365
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,386
Tell them I'm busy...
- Are you crazy?

366
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,895
Tell them I'm busy in a meeting!
Ask them to call later!

367
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:05,917
He's a little busy

368
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,934
Will tomorrow be good?

369
00:36:26,136 --> 00:36:28,111
That's the place where
we dispensed justice

370
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,692
Flogging? With whips?

371
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:34,570
No, actually an elephant used to
crush their skulls

372
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:37,145
Much better system, don't you think?
- Why not? Makes it easier for vultures

373
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:40,990
This is not right

374
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:45,011
Vikram, when we make this hotel,
this damn thing has to go

375
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:51,034
Don't tell my father that...
we still have an elephant here

376
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:54,044
If he loses his temper,
there's no saying what he'll do

377
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:57,056
This is the harem

378
00:36:57,429 --> 00:36:59,404
Seven hundred wives,
my great-grandfather had

379
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,076
My father studied in England
and dropped the custom... pity

380
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,234
So, what did the wives do when
the King was not with them...?

381
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,649
They did it with the palace staff...

382
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,126
anyone who got caught
had his balls cut off

383
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,732
So what did they do
with the balls?

384
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,103
Bloody hot, what?

385
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,255
Hello Dad, I've been
taking them around

386
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:32,602
This is Mr. Wadhwani...
- How do you do?

387
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:36,641
Dad, this is Vikram Malhotra.
He's...

388
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,828
What do you do, young man?
- I fix things, sir

389
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:41,502
Oh... a fixer...
- Fixer, dealer, broker, pimp

390
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:45,182
Depends on your point of view, sir

391
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:49,192
Cocky... good for you!

392
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:55,725
Go away... this is my home!
This is my house!

393
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,263
My younger son...

394
00:38:06,505 --> 00:38:08,274
he's not quite... right.

395
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:20,589
But sir, if you take the price of
land itself at about 5 million...

396
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,804
The price of land is not
more than 3 million

397
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:24,774
30? What are you saying?

398
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:29,294
This is royal land, not some
servant's field or something

399
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,640
We're giving you a good deal
at 3, Maharaja

400
00:38:32,074 --> 00:38:37,655
Nonsense! This land is priceless!
History lives in this place.

401
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:41,336
You're right, Maharaja. And we're
willing to pay for that history...

402
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:43,889
for your memories,
for your tradition...

403
00:38:45,528 --> 00:38:47,527
but I'm afraid it's worth
30 million only

404
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:51,385
Enough! I have had enough!

405
00:38:52,423 --> 00:38:54,898
Excuse me...
- Do something, please!

406
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,104
My father's final offer
is 35 million

407
00:39:22,144 --> 00:39:23,114
Done!

408
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:26,790
Good God!

409
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,472
Dad, what happened to you?

410
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,948
That bloody idiot fired a potshot
at me from the roof! Stop him!

411
00:39:33,188 --> 00:39:34,989
Who was it?
- Your brother, you fool!

412
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,002
Brother...!

413
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:47,539
Dhani Singh, go up there
and bring him down safely

414
00:39:50,757 --> 00:39:53,063
Can you give me a job
in your hotel?

415
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,855
Welcome Vikram,
welcome Randhirbhai

416
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:37,209
Randhirbhai is too busy
for us these days

417
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,256
Vikram is the boy
I was telling you about

418
00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:46,108
He got me the hotel contract.
Now we go for the big one!

419
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:48,786
The kid's got real talent!
- What talent?

420
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,965
His job is the most simple one

421
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:54,478
Everyone in this country
is totally corrupt

422
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:56,821
Not everyone, sir.
The trick is to know who is

423
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,164
That's where I come in

424
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:04,850
Come and see me sometime, Vikram

425
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:10,200
Where have you been?
You were supposed to pick me up!

426
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:12,212
I got stuck with these
political types...

427
00:41:12,384 --> 00:41:14,291
I was telling them
how to run the country

428
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:16,968
Now can we dance?
- After you.

429
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:23,255
Howre you doing...?
- With fancy girls, Balbir!

430
00:41:31,595 --> 00:41:34,904
What happened?
- I just remembered something...

431
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:41,264
Excuse me. Can I take this handsome
man away from you for just 5 minutes?

432
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:45,952
Get Anita out of here

433
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,294
You've found someone again?
I'm not doing it!

434
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:50,503
What do you take me for?
A bloody pimp?

435
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,322
Just do it, kiddo

436
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:19,721
Hey, Dumpy, son of a...!

437
00:42:21,729 --> 00:42:23,532
Sorry, I thought you were
an old college friend

438
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:26,377
It's alright
Vikram Malhotra.

439
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:31,067
I say, Paddy Malhotra
from Doon School?

440
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:36,079
No, Vikram Malhotra from
Jabalpur Municipal School

441
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:45,452
I'm Arun Mehta, I.A.S.
Finance Ministry...

442
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:47,799
...junior in the ranks
but getting there

443
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,442
Someone was talking about you

444
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,658
Aren't you the chap who fixed
some deal for Wadhwani?

445
00:42:57,373 --> 00:43:02,188
Jolly good, my man!
We need people like you...

446
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,200
people who can get things done.
Keep it up, my man...!

447
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:08,541
Gita, over here!

448
00:43:12,265 --> 00:43:14,172
Hey, that's Gita Rao!
She was in college with me

449
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:25,712
My God!
You look like an upcoming tycoon!

450
00:43:26,254 --> 00:43:29,233
Well, he is...
Haven't you heard?

451
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:32,713
This is the chap who got
Wadhwani his deal

452
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:35,759
Really...? That's wonderful!

453
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,269
And you look even more beautiful,
if such a thing were possible

454
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,293
Hello, what's this?
An old college romance?

455
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:48,638
Well, we all had a crush on
Gita in college

456
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,316
She didn't have good
taste in men those days

457
00:43:51,857 --> 00:43:54,835
Oh well, all that has changed.
Thank you very much.

458
00:44:00,392 --> 00:44:03,369
I'm going to get a drink.
Anyone...?

459
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,374
I was just going to ask
Gita for a dance.

460
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:07,882
Excellent!

461
00:44:11,771 --> 00:44:13,072
Excuse me

462
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,440
Once upon a time, there was a young boy
who wrote many soulful letters

463
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,817
Once upon a time, there was a girl
who was very lost

464
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:53,001
Between university in England
and a year in Nairobi...

465
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:56,515
she didn't know how to
respond to those letters

466
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:03,543
So what did the young boy do
in the meantime?

467
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:09,559
Oh, he pined and he drank,
and he yearned and he drank.

468
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,019
In the meantime, he decided to make
pots of money anyway he could

469
00:45:19,576 --> 00:45:21,550
I'm sorry

470
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:26,067
So, where did the lost soul
meet her Prince Charming?

471
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,066
England

472
00:45:30,821 --> 00:45:33,594
He had everything a girl
could possibly want

473
00:45:56,055 --> 00:45:58,691
Oh, come on, we're having
such a good time

474
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:01,041
I think we should leave

475
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:03,714
But can we go to the
Narain's party for a bit?

476
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:09,743
Sir, I take your leave.
It was lovely meeting you

477
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:11,406
Nice to meet you too

478
00:46:11,784 --> 00:46:13,760
I'll just say bye to Mrs Wadhwani

479
00:46:19,414 --> 00:46:21,719
I'll see you later.
- Come, I'll drop you

480
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:23,900
Have you been in touch
with Sidharth?

481
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:30,082
Bye Vikram. See you later

482
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:55,025
Hello...?

483
00:46:56,027 --> 00:46:58,003
No, Madam Gita's just left

484
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,882
No, she's not coming in tomorrow,
she's going to Bhojpur

485
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:06,901
Yes, she'll be staying at
the forest rest-house, I think

486
00:47:08,378 --> 00:47:10,353
Who should I say called?

487
00:47:22,601 --> 00:47:26,415
Got word from the District Magistrate
sahab that you'd be coming

488
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,922
We've been waiting for ages

489
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:33,947
If you want anything,
you'd better tell me now

490
00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:36,424
As it is, the sahab
gives us so much work

491
00:47:37,127 --> 00:47:39,101
I shouldn't be doing this

492
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:26,421
I shouldn't be doing this.

493
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:36,463
Sidharth... Arun loves me

494
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:39,136
This is wrong

495
00:49:07,523 --> 00:49:10,261
That's the problem with poverty!
This road is too long

496
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,942
I don't know how long
my struggle will last...

497
00:49:14,315 --> 00:49:16,554
But I'm not running away like Rajan

498
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,562
What are you looking at?

499
00:49:19,437 --> 00:49:21,412
I was thinking...
- What?

500
00:49:21,715 --> 00:49:23,686
You frown too much

501
00:49:33,862 --> 00:49:35,199
Coming

502
00:49:39,992 --> 00:49:42,362
What's this?
I didn't order this.

503
00:49:43,303 --> 00:49:45,421
Just as well,
'coz it's not on the menu

504
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:54,819
So the lost soul continued her search
in the heartland of India...?

505
00:49:55,686 --> 00:49:58,293
Sidharth, no...!
It's Vikram!

506
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:10,807
Are you going to say it...
am I?

507
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:12,888
What the hell are you doing here?

508
00:50:13,099 --> 00:50:16,081
I heard she was here.
I thought I'd stop by

509
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:18,929
Well, thank you very much.
Now get lost

510
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,431
I'm hurt!

511
00:50:23,642 --> 00:50:26,625
After so many years,
such animosity?

512
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,585
Listen, I'm not going to tattle

513
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:38,148
I understand. You guys meet,
old passions ignite and...

514
00:50:43,097 --> 00:50:45,257
Let's get together
and have a drink

515
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:49,799
To pee under the open sky!

516
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,692
If there is bliss...
it is this!

517
00:50:56,911 --> 00:50:58,987
None but this!

518
00:50:59,445 --> 00:51:01,437
I've always wondered...

519
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:04,468
whether this chap was
a clown or an asshole

520
00:51:05,168 --> 00:51:07,578
Now I know. He's both

521
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:17,990
You know something, Sidharth?
You should work on this place

522
00:51:18,246 --> 00:51:20,656
Make it into a home
for retired people

523
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,744
Small cottages, small farmhouses...

524
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:29,031
You do it, Vikram. I have slightly
different ideas about this place

525
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:31,691
What?

526
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:36,162
That all the peasants will rise up
in revolt some day...

527
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:39,496
and there will be peace
and prosperity in the world

528
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:43,875
It's a load of shit!

529
00:51:47,236 --> 00:51:49,319
I'd like to kill him...
maybe I'll just leave

530
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:50,976
So leave!

531
00:51:51,621 --> 00:51:53,403
Who the hell are you anyway?
Bloody coward!

532
00:51:53,859 --> 00:51:57,929
Privileged man's son playing
games with the poor!

533
00:51:58,212 --> 00:52:00,046
Sidharth, wait. I'm coming

534
00:52:06,617 --> 00:52:08,398
Sidharth, I'm sorry.
I got carried away

535
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:13,347
I'll shut up.
I'm sorry, I say

536
00:52:14,447 --> 00:52:17,889
You guys know me. Come on now.
Forget it... come

537
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,818
Forget it

538
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,034
To the revolution!

539
00:52:47,309 --> 00:52:49,092
Had too much to drink
last night, sahab?

540
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,311
Is Madam still sleeping?

541
00:52:57,468 --> 00:53:00,601
She left early. With some asshole

542
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:09,530
Tell me something, what's the
price of land in these parts?

543
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,046
Welcome to India

544
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,247
"Your man is away in Calcutta,
O fair maiden"

545
00:54:07,248 --> 00:54:09,484
I have to go really far.
I'll call you

546
00:54:30,526 --> 00:54:31,669
What happened?

547
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:34,668
The landlord's men have lynched
and hung four lower-caste men

548
00:54:44,676 --> 00:54:49,169
They weren't letting me
into the cinema hall

549
00:54:49,513 --> 00:54:50,986
I wanted to know which jerk
could stop me

550
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:54,010
The cinema was goddamned full.
I asked for the bloody manager

551
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:56,129
I said, "recognise me?"
And he shat

552
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:58,548
One scene was worth the effort

553
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,514
Lighting...!

554
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:01,874
Rain...!

555
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:12,301
A girl... What legs!

556
00:55:13,335 --> 00:55:16,027
Her navel... totally exposed!

557
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,046
She squealed "where are you"?

558
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:23,040
The bastard's telling them
about a movie

559
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,754
The villain jumped on her
and tore her sari

560
00:55:27,243 --> 00:55:29,027
I thought... what a shit film!

561
00:55:29,178 --> 00:55:32,199
But then suddenly,
the real hero appeared

562
00:55:32,686 --> 00:55:37,180
He said, "Hail Mother Goddess"
and charged at the villains

563
00:56:04,209 --> 00:56:08,559
Stop farting around and tell us
how many people can we mobilise

564
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:12,180
Now how many are there
from the cobbler caste?

565
00:56:12,522 --> 00:56:13,997
There are many

566
00:56:14,156 --> 00:56:17,867
People are really charged up.
We just need some more arms

567
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:19,804
I'm not in favour of this, comrade

568
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:22,407
Do you think these people are ready?

569
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:25,009
Can they stand up against the police
and state machinery?

570
00:56:25,312 --> 00:56:28,755
They'll all be butchered, comrade.
And we'll be responsible

571
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:32,081
Fed up of the movement?
- I'm not talking about running away

572
00:56:34,382 --> 00:56:36,164
I haven't come here for this

573
00:56:37,556 --> 00:56:40,689
I'm talking of a different strategy...
of expanding our mass base

574
00:56:42,303 --> 00:56:44,324
We broke away from Somu Chatterjee's
group for precisely these reasons

575
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:46,171
Have you forgotten?

576
00:56:46,171 --> 00:56:47,956
We must prepare the villagers first

577
00:56:48,893 --> 00:56:51,583
Till that happens, will the police
sing hymns in their praise?

578
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:54,755
I'm not against specific actions
for self-defense

579
00:56:56,905 --> 00:56:59,286
But I can't knowingly lead them
towards their death

580
00:57:04,343 --> 00:57:05,641
I'm sorry comrade...

581
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:07,607
it takes time to bring about
a revolution

582
00:57:08,544 --> 00:57:10,327
And I can give that kind of time

583
00:57:10,812 --> 00:57:12,378
The question is whether you can

584
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:19,610
This can't be just our
decision, Sidharth

585
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,297
"Dear Gita..."

586
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:26,458
"I will not be able to meet you
next month"

587
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:29,769
"We have to shift base to somewhere
close to the Nepal border"

588
00:57:30,811 --> 00:57:32,768
"I'll tell you the details later,
but at the moment..."

589
00:57:33,268 --> 00:57:34,752
"things are extremely tense here"

590
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:39,738
"Scores of our comrades have died
and our organised is split"

591
00:57:40,508 --> 00:57:42,727
"Probir-da and some others have
accepted my point of view"

592
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,721
"We have to rebuild
our organisation"

593
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,200
"Till we meet again...
Sidharth"

594
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:01,659
I'm D.K. Manchanda
And you?

595
00:58:02,194 --> 00:58:05,150
I'm a first class gazetted officer
with a bank

596
00:58:05,747 --> 00:58:07,706
Are you married?
- I'm expecting

597
00:58:08,338 --> 00:58:11,554
So friend, all well?
Shall we call your wife?

598
00:58:11,759 --> 00:58:13,718
What did I do?
I'm just reading the paper

599
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:20,522
So, you finally need
me for something?

600
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:27,492
Yes, I need to make use of
your agile mind

601
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:30,147
Let me guess. Something financial?

602
00:58:32,848 --> 00:58:34,808
No... wrong

603
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:39,455
It's just... silly

604
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,265
What are you doing, Vikram?
- You're not saying anything, Gita!

605
00:59:19,742 --> 00:59:23,717
I'm leaving Arun.
It's just not working out

606
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:28,335
And it was all a big mistake

607
00:59:37,676 --> 00:59:40,155
C'mon...
- No

608
00:59:47,506 --> 00:59:50,122
Arun, please... no!

609
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:24,992
Okay, what is it?

610
01:00:26,663 --> 01:00:27,988
Is it my drinking?

611
01:00:28,723 --> 01:00:31,972
Because if it is, I can stop.
I want to stop...

612
01:00:32,143 --> 01:00:35,291
seriously, I can stop...
Listen, please

613
01:00:35,663 --> 01:00:37,622
You don't like my friends,
I know that

614
01:00:37,988 --> 01:00:39,470
I shouldn't have brought
home those bores

615
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:42,432
Please stop torturing yourself.
It's not about you

616
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:47,408
Gita, it's not fair...
you can't do this...

617
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,435
There is nothing wrong
with our marriage

618
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,400
You can't just walk
out of a marriage

619
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,535
Who is it?

620
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:02,361
Who are you screwing with?

621
01:01:12,262 --> 01:01:14,085
Here, householder

622
01:01:14,256 --> 01:01:16,213
From now on, this piece
of shit belongs to you

623
01:01:17,343 --> 01:01:19,302
So here's where the sparrows shit

624
01:01:30,196 --> 01:01:31,680
You can tie your buffaloes here

625
01:01:47,831 --> 01:01:49,789
I don't want to hurt Arun

626
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,117
You bastard!
You're screwing my wife!

627
01:02:57,618 --> 01:02:59,576
I could... I could... kill you!

628
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,515
I don't know if this is
going to comfort you

629
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:18,971
but Gita is not sleeping
with me

630
01:03:20,668 --> 01:03:22,150
Unfortunately

631
01:03:25,914 --> 01:03:27,874
Vikram! How are you?

632
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:31,456
Gita, look who's here...
Mr. Fixit himself

633
01:03:33,486 --> 01:03:35,446
Hi, want some coffee?

634
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,603
Guess what?
Arun paid me a visit

635
01:03:41,158 --> 01:03:42,914
He asked me if I loved his wife...

636
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,198
I said yes

637
01:03:48,764 --> 01:03:52,307
Thanks, Vikram. I was just beginning
to get horribly sentimental!

638
01:03:52,682 --> 01:03:55,795
So, Vikram, wine bottles
instead of commissions?

639
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:57,963
With commissions.
- Lucky. Smoke?

640
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:05,265
Gita, you haven't unpacked yet?
- Actually, I'm not staying

641
01:04:06,531 --> 01:04:09,250
I've just been thinking about it
for some time

642
01:04:09,453 --> 01:04:12,238
I think I'm going to leave

643
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:15,893
Vikram, imagine, actually going
in a village and living there

644
01:04:26,891 --> 01:04:28,848
To a village near a
forest rest-house...

645
01:04:29,745 --> 01:04:32,167
Look Vikram, if I don't go now,
I never will

646
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:36,483
I know you went through so much
trouble to get me all this...

647
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:38,473
I'm really sorry

648
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:40,639
Well, life goes on folks...

649
01:04:45,488 --> 01:04:47,447
I'm getting married!

650
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:50,496
What?
- I'm getting married!

651
01:05:51,778 --> 01:05:53,397
"Dear Vikram..."

652
01:05:54,235 --> 01:05:57,711
"Once upon a time, there was
a girl called Gita. Remember her?"

653
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,707
"She was arrogant, opinionated and
thought she could change the world"

654
01:06:02,738 --> 01:06:07,675
"And so she came here to Bhojpur.
And then... what happened?"

655
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:12,164
"I don't know. It's too
difficult to describe"

656
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:16,650
"Guess what?"

657
01:06:16,785 --> 01:06:19,968
"I've started an adult literacy class
for tribal women here with Darryl"

658
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:25,854
"Remember him,
my editor friend?"

659
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:35,075
"Sidharth says our set-up is
a bourgeois feel-good scheme"

660
01:06:36,115 --> 01:06:40,553
"This naturally forms the basis for most
of the unnecessary tensions in my life"

661
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,547
I haven't seen my husband for months

662
01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:46,867
One of these days, the villagers
will betray the Naxalites

663
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:49,464
Then we'll be there
to perform the last rites

664
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:51,085
What's happening there?

665
01:06:58,167 --> 01:07:01,088
"Our school is serving as a hospital
because of the malaria epidemic"

666
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,080
"14 people have died so far"

667
01:07:04,975 --> 01:07:07,397
"It looks like the worst is over,
but then again..."

668
01:07:07,765 --> 01:07:09,723
"you can't be sure
of anything here"

669
01:07:11,151 --> 01:07:14,865
"You know something Vikram? Nobody
gives a damn about this place"

670
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:17,361
"It's as if it doesn't exist"

671
01:07:17,895 --> 01:07:19,853
"Still people here laugh sometimes"

672
01:07:25,865 --> 01:07:27,485
"Now enough of my rural trivia"

673
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,806
"The major news is that our son
Chetan was born last week"

674
01:07:31,543 --> 01:07:33,298
"By the way, it was
very generous of you..."

675
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:38,351
"to offer that we name the boy after
you, but Sidharth wasn't too keen!"

676
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:53,165
"Well, what about you and Anita?
You better have a large family"

677
01:07:53,363 --> 01:07:57,146
"So you can do justice to the
wealth and fame you've amassed"

678
01:07:57,548 --> 01:07:59,508
"Drop by my father's
house sometime"

679
01:08:00,173 --> 01:08:02,131
"We've sent them a
photograph of Chetan"

680
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:04,654
"It'll be worth the effort for you"

681
01:08:04,953 --> 01:08:09,098
"He looks just like me - ha ha!
I have to go now"

682
01:08:10,467 --> 01:08:12,584
"Be good and write to me"

683
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,648
"Love, Gita"

684
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:01,343
Go and see what's happening

685
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:13,301
When I shove it up your ass,
you'll stop coughing

686
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,290
You think because you keep
changing your names all the time...

687
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:17,941
we don't know who you are?

688
01:09:18,817 --> 01:09:21,273
You're the one who's
instigating the villagers

689
01:09:21,938 --> 01:09:23,897
Troublemaker!
Get the hell out!

690
01:09:26,854 --> 01:09:28,813
Else, I'll shove some
saw-dust up your ass!

691
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:40,031
So, madam?

692
01:09:41,863 --> 01:09:43,847
There's no basis for the arrest
of these men

693
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:47,007
They are simple labourers!

694
01:09:48,806 --> 01:09:51,761
They're not as simple as they look!

695
01:09:55,216 --> 01:09:59,065
These vermin killed a police officer
near the rail track last night

696
01:09:59,134 --> 01:10:02,214
That's ridiculous,
there's no evidence to support that!

697
01:10:09,728 --> 01:10:11,688
So you're going to teach me
about evidence?

698
01:10:14,012 --> 01:10:18,791
You know how serious an offence
killing a police officer is?

699
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,958
Gita, the officer they've accused
the villagers of killing is outside!

700
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:38,909
Bastard, always lying drunk
at that whore's place!

701
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:42,402
The bastard keeps getting suspended,
but it still has no effect

702
01:10:44,103 --> 01:10:47,986
I'll get you transferred this time!
Laxman, take him to the quarters.

703
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,297
You beat up and tortured
an entire village for nothing!

704
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:56,288
Don't show off your English!
Someone was killed, wasn't he?

705
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:58,747
It could've been anybody!

706
01:10:58,915 --> 01:11:00,874
It could've been a guard
who fell off a train!

707
01:11:01,306 --> 01:11:05,246
It could've been anybody!

708
01:11:07,749 --> 01:11:10,363
They're blind!
Blood-thirsty beasts, all of them!

709
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:16,704
Who do you think you are?
God?

710
01:11:23,724 --> 01:11:25,683
Are you sure they
are influential in the government?

711
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:28,501
Go right in.
They're waiting for you

712
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:30,660
We can't be sure of anything

713
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:56,501
Mr. Taneja

714
01:11:58,363 --> 01:12:00,321
I don't want any trouble

715
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,643
There will no trouble

716
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:09,282
Why are you scared?

717
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:12,111
You're doing it for the
interests of the nation

718
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:14,603
We'll get him a medal for this

719
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,917
I came because Mr. Malhotra said

720
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,902
Relax, Mr. Taneja

721
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:26,883
But an overdraft is illegal
- What illegal?

722
01:12:27,455 --> 01:12:30,206
It's just a question of a couple
of months. No one will get to know

723
01:12:32,905 --> 01:12:35,586
As long as we're there,
it'll be okay

724
01:12:38,084 --> 01:12:41,333
That's all right, but...
- But...?

725
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:49,142
Suppose you're not here anymore?
I could be in...

726
01:12:49,341 --> 01:12:53,916
Not here? Do we look like the kind
of people who won't be here?

727
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:02,087
I'll call you

728
01:13:04,452 --> 01:13:08,733
Vikram is a good boy,
not like those other bloody rats...

729
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:11,718
deserting a sinking ship

730
01:13:12,258 --> 01:13:14,046
Is the ship sinking?

731
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,692
Well, that's what they say

732
01:13:18,402 --> 01:13:20,021
That's what they think.

733
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:24,174
By the way, one of the biggest rats...

734
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,996
is your friend Randhir Singh

735
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:32,643
Just in case you ever
thought of denying it

736
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:37,627
He's an old family friend.
- Sure

737
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,015
Besides, I don't agree with him

738
01:14:00,746 --> 01:14:05,457
In the land of Mahatma Gandhi,
in the land of Subhash Chandra Bose...

739
01:14:05,662 --> 01:14:07,780
it's Hitler who rules

740
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:16,413
Friends, don't be blind agents
for that dynastic party

741
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:17,916
Wake up!

742
01:14:18,448 --> 01:14:22,887
Down with corruption!

743
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:27,868
Down with corruption!

744
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:35,351
Long live Randhir Singh!

745
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,824
I wouldn't have missed this
for the world!

746
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:42,326
Stop screwing around with me

747
01:14:45,016 --> 01:14:47,904
Aren't your new colleagues the ones
you were abusing yesterday?

748
01:14:48,271 --> 01:14:51,227
Oh yes. Times change. People change

749
01:14:53,586 --> 01:14:55,543
So you won't be needing
this cheque anymore?

750
01:14:57,902 --> 01:15:05,172
Kiddo, the wheels of progress and
revolution need to be greased

751
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:10,651
So when the revolution arrives...
remember, we too were revolutionaries

752
01:15:12,182 --> 01:15:17,119
That's the problem. You businessmen
think of only your own interests

753
01:15:17,697 --> 01:15:20,121
And we have to think of
the entire country...

754
01:15:20,485 --> 01:15:25,592
we have to awaken people's...
what do you call it... conscience!

755
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,619
What would your kind
know about socialism?

756
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:37,054
Sure, so now Hindu Fundamentalists,
Muslim Fundamentalists...

757
01:15:37,523 --> 01:15:42,030
Capitalists, Socialists and
Communists will all work together

758
01:15:43,303 --> 01:15:45,261
It's possible. Why not?

759
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:49,342
Yes, and a true Congressman
like your father. See

760
01:16:11,627 --> 01:16:15,176
Forget it, father...
You know it's Pablo's birthday

761
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:19,240
Why screw it up for him?

762
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:21,369
Then why do you talk about things
you don't understand?

763
01:16:24,296 --> 01:16:27,811
Who are your friends to talk about
all this? And who the hell is Sadiq?

764
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:32,276
I just know him. Since they run things
in the party now, they want change...

765
01:16:32,443 --> 01:16:34,302
What do you mean?

766
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:36,799
Change doesn't mean that you will
appoint goons...

767
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:38,949
as office-bearers of
the Congress Party

768
01:16:39,193 --> 01:16:43,275
If you must, appoint those
who have worked among the people...

769
01:16:43,483 --> 01:16:46,771
and we willingly step aside.
- Okay, I'll talk to them

770
01:16:47,473 --> 01:16:49,197
You'll talk to them...?

771
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:54,190
So you will now talk
on my behalf?

772
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:56,849
Hey guys, listen to this.
It's finally happened

773
01:16:57,017 --> 01:16:59,669
"It has now been confirmed, that
a state of National Emergency...

774
01:16:59,843 --> 01:17:01,804
has been declared in India"

775
01:17:02,037 --> 01:17:06,119
"In a midnight swoop, all the top
opposition leaders have been arrested"

776
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,651
"This includes the Gandhian leader..."

777
01:17:08,821 --> 01:17:11,644
"who spearheaded the anti-corruption
movement against the congress Party..."

778
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,631
"and its supreme leader
Mrs. Indira Gandhi"

779
01:17:16,003 --> 01:17:19,620
"This follows the Allahabad High Court
judgement against Mrs. Gandhi..."

780
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:22,118
"which indicted her
on corruption charges"

781
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:26,608
"Calling the opposition agitation as a
conspiracy to destabilise the nation..."

782
01:17:26,777 --> 01:17:30,598
"the Congress Party spokesman said it
was necessary to save the country..."

783
01:17:30,967 --> 01:17:35,083
"from total chaos and anarchy. He also
labelled the opposition call..."

784
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:37,976
"to the country's armed and
civil forces an act of treason..."

785
01:17:38,194 --> 01:17:41,153
You're trying to tell me my father's
a threat to national security?

786
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,105
What nonsense!
Just get the hell out!

787
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:48,530
Perhaps, you haven't heard the news.
Send him outside

788
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:52,024
Else, we'll have to use force.
I'm waiting outside

789
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:02,667
Father...!

790
01:18:03,533 --> 01:18:04,825
Give me my diary

791
01:18:04,996 --> 01:18:06,980
Let me talk to Sadiq
and put an end to this nonsense

792
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,477
No photographs!
Confiscate his bloody camera

793
01:18:12,843 --> 01:18:14,804
Get the hell out of here!

794
01:18:18,097 --> 01:18:20,455
Where the hell is everybody?
Can't get through...

795
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:22,918
The bastards have kept
their phones off the hook!

796
01:18:24,017 --> 01:18:27,441
You don't know what you're doing!
You're making a big mistake

797
01:18:28,472 --> 01:18:32,088
You're arresting a man who never
bothered about his own interests

798
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:34,590
He has worked all his life for
the good of the country!

799
01:18:35,023 --> 01:18:37,074
If you want to arrest someone,
I'll tell you whom to arrest

800
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:44,393
Govt. Sterilisation Camp, Bhojpur.
Bihar 1975

801
01:18:50,484 --> 01:18:52,004
What petition has she brought
this time?

802
01:18:52,347 --> 01:18:53,968
She claims we're using unhygienic
equipment to sterilize the men

803
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:14,051
Things are getting
really dangerous, Gita

804
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:44,176
Run"! It's the police!
- Someone has surely tattled!

805
01:19:51,137 --> 01:19:53,495
The police are out there

806
01:19:54,129 --> 01:19:57,882
Now look, this is too much!
- If you go out, you'll be killed.

807
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:09,055
Listen up!

808
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:14,036
You better give up
your urban comrades.

809
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:21,495
I've warned you before no
Naxalite activity in my area!

810
01:20:23,392 --> 01:20:25,410
You've seen for yourself...

811
01:20:26,384 --> 01:20:30,001
the dirty politics of getting
involved in naxalite politics

812
01:20:30,574 --> 01:20:34,395
He lost his life overnight

813
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,390
But you still didn't see sense

814
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:42,375
Your crops were ready
to be harvested

815
01:20:43,010 --> 01:20:44,972
You could have had
your daughters married.

816
01:20:46,403 --> 01:20:49,588
I wanted everything to
go off peacefully too

817
01:20:50,227 --> 01:20:53,276
But you guys have made
life difficult for me.

818
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:57,276
What do you want me to do...?
Beg you with folded hands?

819
01:20:58,906 --> 01:21:02,851
This is a habit you can't
give up easily!

820
01:21:03,894 --> 01:21:06,852
Once something goes wrong...

821
01:21:07,352 --> 01:21:09,245
Just some old crazy women...

822
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:39,269
Listen kiddo, those bastards came to
my house with a warrant yesterday...

823
01:21:40,204 --> 01:21:43,096
- Don't worry...
- What do you mean, don't worry?

824
01:21:43,996 --> 01:21:47,181
If they arrest me...
You don't know them...

825
01:21:47,387 --> 01:21:54,167
Listen... do something... tell them
I'm from the same caste...

826
01:21:55,102 --> 01:21:57,992
from the same village...
my grandfather's uncles

827
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,650
are the Home Minister's third cousins...

828
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:03,242
you talk to him, he'll help me...

829
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:05,964
What happened to your conscience?

830
01:22:06,175 --> 01:22:07,965
To hell with conscience!

831
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,098
Is this any time for jokes?

832
01:22:11,162 --> 01:22:15,607
Why is that cop staring at me?

833
01:22:16,815 --> 01:22:18,005
He's not...

834
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:20,004
He's just here to pray that
he gets transferred...

835
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:21,160
to the Connaught Place
police station.

836
01:22:21,338 --> 01:22:25,919
Never mind. If they agree to
take me back into the party...

837
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:30,570
Listen, I'm not coming empty-handed
I have my entire constituency.

838
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:38,061
Otherwise, I'll tell them about
the funds you gave our party...

839
01:22:42,752 --> 01:22:43,942
Tell them.

840
01:22:44,115 --> 01:22:50,034
Help me... you must...
for old times' sake...

841
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:55,517
I'm like your brother...
I was your father's student...

842
01:22:56,884 --> 01:22:58,505
Don't talk about him.
He's is jail.

843
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,999
But unlike you,
he's not shitting in his pants.

844
01:23:22,954 --> 01:23:24,916
He doesn't wish to see anyone.

845
01:24:01,128 --> 01:24:02,851
He has a slight fever.

846
01:24:07,545 --> 01:24:09,768
He's grown taller,
have you noticed?

847
01:24:42,626 --> 01:24:44,587
I messed up your life, didn't I?

848
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:47,114
I'm sorry, Gita. I...

849
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,098
You could've left me.

850
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:53,093
Sidharth...
it's not only about you.

851
01:24:54,597 --> 01:24:56,558
I want to be here.

852
01:24:57,656 --> 01:24:59,414
I love you.

853
01:25:18,672 --> 01:25:20,362
Time to go.

854
01:25:24,392 --> 01:25:26,013
Say bye to Chetan.

855
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:33,997
I've arranged for him
to go back.

856
01:25:37,693 --> 01:25:39,314
Try and understand.

857
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,181
It's just not fair to keep
Chetan here anymore.

858
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:49,228
I've spoken to my parents, they're
coming to pick him up now.

859
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:50,243
Hello... Mr. Tyebji. This is
Vikram Malhotra speaking.

860
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,748
I was in college with
Sidharth and Gita.

861
01:26:54,455 --> 01:26:56,424
How are you sir...?

862
01:26:57,627 --> 01:27:00,599
I hadn't heard from them
for a long time, so I thought...

863
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:15,215
If you could tell them
that I'd called... Goodbye.

864
01:27:17,965 --> 01:27:21,563
Friends, I have this great
urge to express...

865
01:27:22,272 --> 01:27:24,242
my feelings in a couplet...

866
01:27:33,793 --> 01:27:37,596
I, Jhanda Singh,
Senior Inspector In-Charge,

867
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:40,597
Badhaiya police outpost,

868
01:27:40,972 --> 01:27:46,279
on the day of 7th July,
1975, at 12 noon,

869
01:27:47,451 --> 01:27:50,286
All of us had gone to enquire
after a fellow officer

870
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:54,287
who had diarrohea.

871
01:27:54,497 --> 01:27:57,628
Taking advantage
of our absence,

872
01:27:58,505 --> 01:28:00,474
the local populace attacked
the extremist Naxalities...

873
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:04,812
who were in custody at that time.

874
01:28:11,594 --> 01:28:17,765
Probir Mitra and Sidharth were
badly beaten up by villagers.

875
01:28:18,774 --> 01:28:22,269
Also, Gita Rao who has been carrying on
subversive activities in the name of...

876
01:28:22,448 --> 01:28:29,292
running a school also had to
bear the brunt of the villages' outrage.

877
01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:34,495
Fortunately, we arrived
just in time

878
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:38,803
and prevented the matter
from getting out of hand.

879
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:42,315
Station-in-charge Badhaiya.

880
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:44,316
Jhanda Singh.

881
01:29:06,494 --> 01:29:08,292
Sorry, Mehmood.

882
01:29:08,865 --> 01:29:10,834
Please be sited.

883
01:29:12,337 --> 01:29:16,300
As you know,
we're expecting Madam soon...

884
01:29:16,946 --> 01:29:20,316
Grandpa, Fluffy's
run away again...

885
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:24,314
Oh dear, just a minute,
I'll have him found for you

886
01:29:27,131 --> 01:29:29,728
Hey... is somebody there?

887
01:29:30,370 --> 01:29:32,738
Rashid... come here

888
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:50,699
You know, my son...

889
01:29:53,412 --> 01:29:56,383
the over-zealousness of youth...

890
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:01,892
I tried to stop him
so many times.

891
01:30:02,996 --> 01:30:06,059
Now, I believe
he's been arrested.

892
01:30:13,615 --> 01:30:15,345
Where's he now?

893
01:30:15,853 --> 01:30:20,692
Don't know, in some village in Bihar.

894
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:34,719
Please do something...!

895
01:30:36,624 --> 01:30:39,720
Just 5 minutes,
we'll handle it...

896
01:30:39,929 --> 01:30:44,393
I'll try my best... We don't
control things anymore...

897
01:30:44,905 --> 01:30:49,744
A younger lot has taken over...
They say it's for the better...

898
01:30:51,918 --> 01:30:55,413
All these problems are arising
because...

899
01:30:55,758 --> 01:30:58,422
nowadays, I'm handling
trade unions.

900
01:30:58,864 --> 01:31:00,833
But don't lose hope

901
01:31:05,142 --> 01:31:06,633
Hello, sir.

902
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:09,883
Remember me?
I was in college with Sidharth...

903
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,388
Are you okay, sir.

904
01:31:16,963 --> 01:31:18,933
- How are you?
- I'm fine, sir.

905
01:31:20,871 --> 01:31:23,398
Have you heard from
Sidharth or Gita?

906
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:27,905
They've in jail...
somewhere in Bihar...

907
01:31:36,632 --> 01:31:37,930
I want Gita Rao found.

908
01:31:46,984 --> 01:31:51,857
How ought be every leader?
- Like Indira Gandhi

909
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:09,417
Sorry sir, but we got information
from our local intelligence...

910
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:13,865
Here she is, sir.
Come.

911
01:32:47,994 --> 01:32:49,964
Vikram told me where you were.

912
01:33:21,255 --> 01:33:24,557
Leave me...!
- It's okay.

913
01:33:35,948 --> 01:33:37,918
It's okay, Gita, but I may not
be there the next time.

914
01:33:40,088 --> 01:33:41,717
Look at me!

915
01:33:42,092 --> 01:33:43,924
Do you know what they could
have done to you in there?

916
01:33:44,096 --> 01:33:45,928
You have any idea.

917
01:33:55,817 --> 01:34:01,123
Oh, you poor thing!

918
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:31,109
Arun, will you do something for me?
- What?

919
01:34:33,652 --> 01:34:36,623
Find Sidharth for me... please!

920
01:34:51,184 --> 01:34:53,154
Did you know I'm Married now?

921
01:34:53,422 --> 01:34:55,152
I have a kid.

922
01:34:55,859 --> 01:34:57,657
It's lovely.

923
01:35:00,267 --> 01:35:02,237
But you haven't charged a bit.

924
01:35:10,653 --> 01:35:12,622
New Delhi, 1976

925
01:35:29,353 --> 01:35:31,322
I thought you wouldn't come...

926
01:35:37,367 --> 01:35:38,665
What's up?

927
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:43,010
I just wanted to thank you...
that's all

928
01:35:46,851 --> 01:35:49,185
Give me another...
Howre you?

929
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,692
I'm alright... I'm okay.

930
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:02,035
You?

931
01:36:02,446 --> 01:36:04,712
Me? Well,

932
01:36:05,285 --> 01:36:08,120
acquiring wealth and power
at an alarming rate!

933
01:36:10,294 --> 01:36:12,662
Yes, that figures.

934
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:20,671
So... where's Sidharth?

935
01:36:32,934 --> 01:36:34,699
I don't know...

936
01:37:23,059 --> 01:37:24,721
I'm okay

937
01:37:30,906 --> 01:37:31,896
Come on!

938
01:37:35,181 --> 01:37:36,740
Hurry up!

939
01:37:46,801 --> 01:37:48,771
Gita there is bad news for you.

940
01:37:49,206 --> 01:37:51,768
Sidharth and Kiru were shot at.

941
01:37:52,379 --> 01:37:54,781
Kiru survived... but...

942
01:38:08,274 --> 01:38:09,742
Those bastards...

943
01:39:04,008 --> 01:39:05,977
Call me, if you need something...

944
01:39:14,828 --> 01:39:17,799
Stay... please...

945
01:39:31,057 --> 01:39:34,028
"Vikram, as usual,
thanks for everything"

946
01:39:34,262 --> 01:39:37,234
"I thought about it, but
I'm going back to the village"

947
01:39:37,869 --> 01:39:41,239
"It's for the best.
I will write to you"

948
01:39:41,876 --> 01:39:42,844
"Gita"

949
01:39:44,882 --> 01:39:48,252
What are you guys upto...?

950
01:39:50,626 --> 01:39:56,866
Hey you, stop that! Playing with
the gun will explode in your ass!

951
01:39:57,071 --> 01:40:01,204
Is there a holiday? Some kid is
fiddling with my gun...

952
01:40:01,378 --> 01:40:02,869
and you're sitting pretty here.

953
01:40:03,015 --> 01:40:05,884
Could you please there are patients...
- What please, go, do your work.

954
01:40:07,389 --> 01:40:08,982
So much tension...

955
01:40:18,075 --> 01:40:20,170
The wound is dry now.

956
01:40:20,413 --> 01:40:22,507
You were fortunate that those
cops brought you here.

957
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,856
But these ones are different.

958
01:40:31,566 --> 01:40:34,366
They were talking of finishing you
off on the way to the police station.

959
01:40:38,478 --> 01:40:40,209
Who are you?

960
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,386
Save yourself, Comrade.

961
01:40:50,534 --> 01:40:54,234
Bullet?

962
01:40:55,943 --> 01:40:57,913
Soldier?

963
01:40:59,116 --> 01:41:00,915
Don't want to tell...

964
01:41:01,487 --> 01:41:05,426
I'm on my way... Soon I hope...

965
01:41:27,601 --> 01:41:31,404
Please comrade... call Delhi for me...
my father... the number is 273857...

966
01:41:31,608 --> 01:41:33,908
Tell him he has to get me out of here...
Tell him they're going to kill me...

967
01:41:34,447 --> 01:41:37,418
and give him the district magistrate's
number as well.

968
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,949
- Hello, is Gita there?
- No.

969
01:41:55,652 --> 01:41:58,623
Oh no, sir!
- Who is calling?

970
01:41:59,492 --> 01:42:02,463
I have a message.
Please inform her somehow.

971
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:05,468
Someone just called from
a hospital in Bhojpur.

972
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:07,640
They said the police is going
to kill Sidharth sahab.

973
01:42:11,012 --> 01:42:13,312
What do you mean...?
Is Sidharth alive?

974
01:42:14,085 --> 01:42:15,917
I'm just a servant sir.

975
01:42:16,189 --> 01:42:18,420
Sidharth saheb's father has had
a stroke. They're all at the hospital.

976
01:42:18,961 --> 01:42:20,589
I don't know what to do.

977
01:42:22,299 --> 01:42:24,098
Well, neither do I.

978
01:42:24,337 --> 01:42:26,307
Gita's already left, son.

979
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,272
Please do something...

980
01:42:28,545 --> 01:42:30,104
You have so many contacts...

981
01:42:30,314 --> 01:42:32,284
You only can do something.

982
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:44,972
Just half an hour for the presentation.
What are you doing? Hurry up!

983
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:49,472
Hello, yes Randhir...

984
01:42:49,683 --> 01:42:52,483
find out the Member of Parliament
from Bhojpur, Bihar is...

985
01:44:51,837 --> 01:44:54,637
What are you doing? I don't want
to be treated here...

986
01:44:54,842 --> 01:44:58,645
get me a taxi, bike...
whatever you have.

987
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,148
Look how dirty this is...

988
01:45:02,322 --> 01:45:04,622
I'm going to catch some disease
if you keep me here for another minute.

989
01:45:05,194 --> 01:45:08,428
I want to make a call...
take me to a phone...

990
01:45:08,634 --> 01:45:10,604
Sorry, the phones have
just gone dead...

991
01:45:11,372 --> 01:45:16,109
What do you want? Money?
Here, take as much as you want...

992
01:45:16,448 --> 01:45:17,780
Please Vikram, don't go...

993
01:45:18,151 --> 01:45:20,121
You shut up! Jerk,,
this is all thanks to you!

994
01:45:20,289 --> 01:45:22,121
First, I get the news that you're dead.

995
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:26,120
Then, you're alive.
What was I supposed to do?

996
01:45:28,536 --> 01:45:30,802
Have you checked for
the air bubbles...?

997
01:45:31,842 --> 01:45:33,470
We'll nave to keep you
under observation.

998
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,649
Tomorrow, doctors from the
Bhojpur Hospital will come.

999
01:45:35,849 --> 01:45:37,819
Then it's between you and them.

1000
01:45:47,705 --> 01:45:51,337
I understand why you're
angry with me, but...

1001
01:45:53,381 --> 01:45:55,510
Look at me, man.
I'm in deep shit.

1002
01:45:56,554 --> 01:45:59,651
Don't bloody well faint on me again!

1003
01:46:23,536 --> 01:46:25,164
Hunh...

1004
01:46:25,339 --> 01:46:27,309
We've come to pick you up.

1005
01:46:28,879 --> 01:46:31,851
We're all here, no problem now.

1006
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:36,582
How about the cop?
- One's drunk

1007
01:46:43,806 --> 01:46:45,776
One moment, there's Vikram.

1008
01:46:46,243 --> 01:46:48,213
Let's move, he's not in danger.

1009
01:47:03,274 --> 01:47:05,244
Eh... get up!

1010
01:47:06,381 --> 01:47:07,781
Shit! I took a nap for just
two minutes... goddamned hell!

1011
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:12,185
Who asked you to drink...?
- You needn't say that to me!

1012
01:47:17,801 --> 01:47:21,205
Look they took away the whole bed.

1013
01:47:22,376 --> 01:47:25,211
And nobody is saying anything.

1014
01:47:25,748 --> 01:47:27,377
He was talking to this jerk!

1015
01:47:27,786 --> 01:47:31,225
I've got little kids. There won't be any
complaint against me, I hope...?

1016
01:47:31,492 --> 01:47:33,222
You'll be sterilized!
- But I'm a government employee!

1017
01:47:33,496 --> 01:47:36,228
To hell with you!
Go and ask him where he is...

1018
01:47:40,608 --> 01:47:43,580
Hey, tell me, you bastard...!

1019
01:47:56,404 --> 01:47:57,838
They carried him away

1020
01:47:58,006 --> 01:48:01,672
And this guy was lying here,
sozzled to his eyes

1021
01:48:02,315 --> 01:48:04,285
Save my skin, please!

1022
01:48:24,989 --> 01:48:27,585
I think they must've been
partners or something.

1023
01:48:44,658 --> 01:48:47,687
Move it... c'mon!
- Let me go!

1024
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:52,700
Let me go! Leave me alone!
Where are you taking me...?

1025
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:06,130
The other guy's escaped!

1026
01:49:07,533 --> 01:49:09,263
But his friend is here.

1027
01:49:09,469 --> 01:49:11,769
We'll just shoot him and
throw some acid on his face,

1028
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:15,743
no one will recognise the face...
they don't walk around checking.

1029
01:50:35,925 --> 01:50:37,360
What are you doing?

1030
01:50:38,063 --> 01:50:40,033
Come on, go ahead, shoot...!

1031
01:50:40,534 --> 01:50:42,367
I'm Vikram Malhotra...

1032
01:50:43,072 --> 01:50:46,875
I know your Member of Parliament
Surender Singh, he is my friend...

1033
01:50:47,413 --> 01:50:49,382
I'm not Sidharth
that insurgent...!

1034
01:50:52,823 --> 01:50:54,759
Go on, just shoot...

1035
01:51:07,449 --> 01:51:09,351
It's empty...
- Where are the bullets?

1036
01:51:09,554 --> 01:51:11,523
Shit, my kids must have
taken them to play with...

1037
01:51:13,394 --> 01:51:15,864
Hit him harder... We'll have
to finish him off like this...

1038
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:21,869
Stop!

1039
01:51:31,961 --> 01:51:33,793
What's happening here?

1040
01:51:34,065 --> 01:51:36,797
Not my mistake.
This guy asked me to bump him off

1041
01:51:38,439 --> 01:51:40,409
He was escaping from custody, sir

1042
01:53:01,556 --> 01:53:04,323
I can't fool myself any longer.
I just can't do this.

1043
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:06,999
They would have killed you...
- They should have.

1044
01:53:08,569 --> 01:53:10,334
I mean it, they should have.

1045
01:53:13,511 --> 01:53:15,344
Will you come with me Gita?

1046
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:26,529
"Dear Gita..."

1047
01:53:28,605 --> 01:53:30,370
"what can I say?"

1048
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:33,280
"Sorry"

1049
01:53:36,753 --> 01:53:38,780
"Our parting, I guess,
was inevitable"

1050
01:53:39,158 --> 01:53:41,458
"Maybe, even necessary"

1051
01:53:43,633 --> 01:53:45,226
"You have to, I suppose..."

1052
01:53:46,271 --> 01:53:48,571
"get over your first love,
in order to be free"

1053
01:53:53,784 --> 01:53:55,753
"Thank you for sending Chetan
to London with my father"

1054
01:53:56,723 --> 01:54:00,423
"It was inexplicable, the feeling
of seeing him after all these years"

1055
01:54:01,398 --> 01:54:04,096
"The last time I saw you
at your father's house..."

1056
01:54:04,336 --> 01:54:06,101
"I was too wrought up inside"

1057
01:54:07,142 --> 01:54:10,045
"The world hadn't changed in the ways
that I wanted it to"

1058
01:54:10,481 --> 01:54:13,453
"I know that you're right,
it has"

1059
01:54:13,787 --> 01:54:16,690
"That no one can rape a lower-caste
in those parts that easily anymore"

1060
01:54:17,093 --> 01:54:19,062
"He might get a certain
body part chopped off"

1061
01:54:19,498 --> 01:54:22,469
"And I know that's a leap of
about five thousand years"

1062
01:54:22,636 --> 01:54:24,070
"But still..."

1063
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,472
"Anyway, Probir-da is still there"

1064
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:29,080
"And... you"

1065
01:54:29,516 --> 01:54:32,487
"By the way, please give him
the book I am sending you"

1066
01:54:33,122 --> 01:54:35,490
"And tell him that I'll
write to him soon"

1067
01:54:38,532 --> 01:54:41,732
"As for me, you know
I'm studying medicine now"

1068
01:54:42,138 --> 01:54:44,506
"I'm the oldest student
in my class"

1069
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:48,516
"Maybe the mysteries of the human body
will be less confusing"

1070
01:54:49,151 --> 01:54:54,115
"And someday, I will return...
maybe"

1071
01:55:02,475 --> 01:55:05,140
"Gita, I often think of Vikram"

1072
01:55:06,483 --> 01:55:10,081
"Pablo told me that his wife had put
him in some specialised institution"

1073
01:55:11,124 --> 01:55:13,492
"But when Pablo went to see him,
the authorities told him..."

1074
01:55:13,695 --> 01:55:15,426
"there's no one by that name"

1075
01:55:15,766 --> 01:55:19,102
"I smiled when I heard that"

1076
01:55:20,541 --> 01:55:22,511
"I think I know where he is"
