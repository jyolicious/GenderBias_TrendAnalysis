1
00:01:51,132 --> 00:01:54,101
Prepare profit and loss
statements after taking...

2
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,069
..into account the
following adjustments..

3
00:01:57,472 --> 00:01:58,530
One..

4
00:01:58,606 --> 00:02:02,599
Returns outwards Rs.1000
were wrongly included in sales.

5
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:13,861
Returns outwards Rs.1000
were wrongly included in sales..

6
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,930
In sales.

7
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,042
Included in sales..

8
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,101
"Listen to what I have to say.. "

9
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:58,276
"You know what time is. "

10
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:06,616
"The night is sleeping and
a new day has awakened. "

11
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:14,094
"This ambience is still in slumber. "

12
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:22,401
"Wishes are leading my way. "

13
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:51,063
Returns outwards Rs.7000
were wrongly included in sales..

14
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:17,005
- Bhaiyya.. Bhaiyya!

15
00:04:18,543 --> 00:04:20,033
Bhaiyya! Open the door.

16
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,504
Brother!

17
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,945
What are you doing in there?
Bhaiyya!

18
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,075
Open the door!!

19
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:34,555
Chhotu! Why didn't you
wake me up sooner?!

20
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:37,958
You said you were going to
study all night..

21
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,290
..I thought you'd be up by now.

22
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,028
Did you fall asleep?

23
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,303
You fell asleep! You had 4 cups of coffee
and you still fell asleep!

24
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:50,834
What will you do now?

25
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,868
How will you give your exam now?!  

26
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,113
Shut up! This is all your fault!

27
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,603
Just try not to fail, I guess.

28
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:59,077
Now you sit here and
eat this breakfast! I'm off..

29
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,685
Move.
- Best of luck!

30
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:13,296
The same bloody situation again, Sid..

31
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,067
..you should've at least studied
for this one last exam..

32
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:20,499
Ten questions out of thirty?

33
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:23,168
That's not so bad..
you'll probably pass..

34
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:30,383
Or, maybe you won't..
What are you going to do, Sid?

35
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:32,351
You're never going to do anything,
Sidharth Mehra.

36
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,513
You'll definitely fail in this exam.

37
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,049
Because that's what happens..

38
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:38,824
..when you don't attend
a single lecture the whole year.

39
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:40,975
That's just what you deserve.

40
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,992
But what do you have to worry about, Sid?

41
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:47,526
Who cares if you fail?
Your father will still be loaded..

42
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,139
..and you'll still have the best car
in this college! Right!

43
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,073
Shut up!
- Relax.

44
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:56,575
Don't listen to these losers,
Sid.. don't worry.

45
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:57,938
I'm your friend..

46
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:00,514
..and I know that you're going to pass,
like you always do!

47
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,311
By the way,
where were you last night?

48
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:06,614
I kept calling..
why didn't you answer?

49
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,423
Did you read the notes I gave you?

50
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:11,260
Oh shut up Laxmi..
Can't you at least let him dream in peace?

51
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:14,920
Sid! I'm in the same situation as you.

52
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:17,329
I couldn't study last night either.

53
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,096
I was with Neha, dude..

54
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:27,677
She was studying economics and
I was studying her. All night long!

55
00:06:28,912 --> 00:06:29,909
Anyway don't worry brother..

56
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,607
If we fail, we'll fail together.

57
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,144
We've been together since kindergarten.

58
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:34,775
What's one more year, right?

59
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:35,777
Don't worry, pal.

60
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,061
What the hell is Debbie's problem?

61
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,296
I don't want to go to her farewell party.

62
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:22,626
It'll be bloody boring anyway..

63
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:25,193
Shut up Sid! We have to go!

64
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:29,307
We might never see these people again.
This is it.

65
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,435
College is over.

66
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,210
Where did the last 5 years go?

67
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:36,714
Life is going to change now..
there's so much to do!

68
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,047
You're right, there's a lot to do!

69
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:42,950
Now that the exams are over,
I can finally start my diet!

70
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:52,258
From tomorrow.. I swear!

71
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,800
You don't have to diet.
I'll marry you!

72
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:56,660
Please, don't be silly..

73
00:07:56,837 --> 00:07:57,895
Ok, can we go now?
- Yeah let's go.

74
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,030
Come Rishi.

75
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,137
What is this?

76
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,145
Sid! Give it back! Sid!

77
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,245
What the hell is this?!

78
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:17,884
He bought it for Neha.
I think her name's engraved in there too..

79
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:20,251
Give it back Sid.

80
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,054
Rish, you gotta be kidding me..

81
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,088
Sid, I love her!

82
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,357
Dude, you're pathetic!

83
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:25,525
Don't be an idiot.

84
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,735
Rish.. are you actually
going to propose to Neha?!

85
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,772
Put that ring away!
Have you gone mad?

86
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:34,267
Why are you being so serious?

87
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,678
You know, everyone has
to get serious after college..

88
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,539
..you'll have to do it too.

89
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:42,608
Right, which is why I've made
a really serious plan.

90
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:44,575
What? - Tell me.
- Lets go and get drunk!

91
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,589
Sid! Be serious!
- Be serious.

92
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:48,624
Yeah but I don't want to
be serious right now!

93
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:52,293
We've finished our exams today..
who cares about tomorrow..

94
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:57,599
..as long as we can have
some fun.. tonight? Come on!

95
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:00,745
Let's go!

96
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:04,231
Let's go!
- Yes.

97
00:12:44,937 --> 00:12:46,031
Is that Rishi, no?

98
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,532
Maa! Why don't you knock..?

99
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,201
You are being my son..
Why knocking?

100
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,737
What do you want, ma?

101
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,252
I came to meet you..
So much time not seeing you..

102
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,952
Ma please stop speaking in English..

103
00:13:02,222 --> 00:13:02,980
You don't know how to..

104
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:08,652
How your exam Siddy?

105
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,555
It was Ok..

106
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,226
I'm so proud of you..
You're a graduate now.

107
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:21,774
Now you must learn
some organization Siddy..

108
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,313
What mess.. Why do you keep
ordering pizza all the time?

109
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:29,784
I make such good food at home.

110
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:35,552
And stop playing videogames all day.

111
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,923
You have way too many clothes!

112
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,886
Throw them all away now.

113
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,125
These tiny-tiny tshirts
don't suit you anymore.

114
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:49,198
You are the man now.. Not boy..

115
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:50,563
Be mature.

116
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,171
You should wear shirts..
you'll look handsome..

117
00:13:54,677 --> 00:13:57,641
Maa, I always look handsome!
Stop bugging me!

118
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:02,116
And don't touch my things!
I've told you this before!

119
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:15,231
Ma.. Here, you can fold it.

120
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,031
And don't feel bad now..

121
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,829
Will you eat dinner with us?
I made it myself..

122
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:24,432
Eating? - Yes Ma.

123
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,241
What a car man!

124
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:41,815
Sid, you should join the office.

125
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:46,329
Whoa! Where did the office come from?

126
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:48,292
Your college is over, right?

127
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,701
And you don't have
classes to skip anymore..?

128
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:52,695
No..

129
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,370
Then you're joining the office.

130
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,070
But pa.. what am I going to do there?

131
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:01,411
Work, what else?

132
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:06,574
But pa! Office?!

133
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:11,186
I mean.. our company
manufactures bathroom furnishings!

134
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:13,401
'Flower Showers' for heaven's sake..

135
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,986
It's just.. it's just not my thing!

136
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,155
Just not your thing?

137
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,355
Do you know that 'Bathroom Fittings
and Furnishings Association'

138
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,660
Rated those same 'shower heads'
number 1 last year?!

139
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:26,361
Everyone from millionaires to mailmen are
buying our showers!

140
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:27,831
Do you know what that means?

141
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,769
Our company has taught lndia
how to shower in style!

142
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:35,046
No! - No!

143
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:39,385
No way! I'm not joining the office!

144
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:40,911
Ok then Sid!

145
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,287
Actually, I was thinking that..

146
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:44,721
..this car would look
really good in our garage.

147
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:50,026
You're not serious? Are you?!

148
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,832
Just work at the office for 6 months.

149
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,208
The car is yours..

150
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:57,635
6 months?!
That's too long, pa.. 15 days..

151
00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:01,037
Do I look like an idiot?
At least 90 days..

152
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,042
No pa.. twenty days..

153
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:05,179
Minimum 60 days..

154
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:06,980
No more than 30 days.

155
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:12,044
Thirty days? Ok done!
You can start work tomorrow.

156
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,056
- Tomorrow?! Yeah ok..

157
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:23,959
Pa.. What kind of a deal is this?
A Porsche for a month's work?

158
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:29,233
My son is joining my office.
That's the biggest deal!

159
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,647
Sorry ma, I have to go.
My friends are here.

160
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,718
Eat something before you go..

161
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:44,948
Mother I will be going to office
from tomorrow.

162
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:45,779
Last night of freedom..

163
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:46,814
Bye! Love you.

164
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,128
Friends Hello!
DJ cut the music!

165
00:16:56,756 --> 00:16:58,400
Laila.. got any plans after college?

166
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,669
I'm going for the Miss lndia contest!

167
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:02,095
I've been training for a year now..

168
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,673
Dieting, workouts..
Hey, you wanna feel my abs?

169
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:08,745
Have you seen Taare Zameen Par?

170
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,200
You know, my life is
exactly like that film..

171
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,184
I don't want to be
a journalist anymore.

172
00:17:15,436 --> 00:17:17,450
I can't handle
this tabloid culture..

173
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:21,182
Rishi! This party is so tacky!
I wanna go home!

174
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:26,722
Baby! Not everything can be
as perfect as you, can it? Lemon tart?

175
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,028
I wanna go home, Rishi.
I'm leaving. Bye.

176
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,762
But what about the lemon tart..?

177
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:34,430
Do you love lemon tart more than me?
I'm going home!

178
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,838
Hi everyone.
This song goes up to Aarti.

179
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:41,175
Aarti, I love you.

180
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,498
Stop! Please don't!

181
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:10,332
I hate being photographed..

182
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:11,869
Why?

183
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:16,273
Because.. Because
I don't look good in them.

184
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,747
Not at all, I think you'll look nice.

185
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:29,828
You're not from my college, are you?

186
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:31,689
Nope..

187
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:34,230
Thought as much.. you look
a little older than this crowd.

188
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,933
Thanks! Only a little I hope.

189
00:18:40,258 --> 00:18:41,539
So what are you doing at this party?

190
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,574
I came along with some
girls from the hostel..

191
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:49,505
This girl Debbie,
she's one of the organizers and..

192
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:51,852
Wait a minute..
You came here with Debbie!?

193
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:53,105
Yeah..

194
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,289
Oh God, if she sees you with me, she's..

195
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:02,194
What's WRONG with you?

196
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,459
With me?
She's the one with the problem.

197
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:08,796
That freak! Anyway, you're lucky,
my company is way better than hers.

198
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:10,863
Is that so?
- Yeah, seriously.

199
00:19:12,141 --> 00:19:13,540
Ok.. Iet's find out.

200
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,273
So what do you do?

201
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:19,147
Me? Er.. I spend my dad's money.

202
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:23,044
Nice. And what do plan
on doing after college?

203
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,085
I plan on continuing to
spend my dad's money.

204
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:28,082
Sit.

205
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:34,160
What about you?
What do you do?

206
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,063
I'm new to Bombay.
Here to earn my own money.

207
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:40,363
Oh? So you're not from Bombay?

208
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:43,531
Do you like it here?

209
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,065
Actually I haven't seen much yet.

210
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:50,112
I got off the train and
went to the hostel, and now I'm here.

211
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:53,510
Wait a minute..
You got here TODAY!?

212
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,111
And out of all the places
you could have gone to,

213
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,553
You chose THlS boring party?

214
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,748
Why?

215
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,452
It was too late to go anywhere else..

216
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:09,231
Listen, this is Bombay..
It's never late here..

217
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:15,166
And you know what?
The city is at its best at night.

218
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,269
Less traffic, less heat..

219
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,140
Really, you should have
been out there right now..

220
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,012
So let's go for a walk!

221
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:26,946
Walk?
- Yeah..

222
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,778
When?
- Now..

223
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:41,809
One second, hold on.. I don't want
to give you the wrong idea..

224
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:44,500
But it was your idea..

225
00:20:44,704 --> 00:20:46,554
I know, but I don't
even know you and..

226
00:20:47,273 --> 00:20:48,304
Well, I don't know you either..

227
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:51,402
Yeah but listen, it's not like
I want to sleep with you!

228
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,875
Whoa! Did I say that I wanted
to sleep with you?!

229
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:58,683
It didn't even cross my mind..

230
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,063
Oh come on, be honest.

231
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:03,653
You met a girl at a party,
and you're leaving with her in 5 minutes.

232
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,906
Of course it crossed your mind!

233
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:08,218
Ok, it might have..

234
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,471
But if you have a problem with that,
it won't again.

235
00:21:11,865 --> 00:21:12,900
It's all good.

236
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,037
Really? Ok let's go for that walk then.

237
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:24,436
Ok. Wait a second..
What's your name? I'm Sidharth..

238
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:27,193
I'm Aisha! Hi!

239
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,477
No one.

240
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:35,619
Really? You don't have
any friends here?

241
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:37,483
Family?

242
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,360
Nope. - The you must have a job..

243
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:41,119
Not yet!

244
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,376
You ran away from home, didn't you?

245
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,432
Really Aisha..
why have you come to Bombay?

246
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:49,135
To meet you..

247
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,030
Come on, tell me seriously.

248
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,500
Seriously, to become independent.

249
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,207
I'm from Calcutta, Sidharth.
I've lived there all my life.

250
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,608
I wanted to give my life a new direction,
so I came here.

251
00:22:06,121 --> 00:22:06,948
To try something new..

252
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:09,316
Like a holiday?

253
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:15,320
No Sidharth..!
Not like a holiday.. Iike.. Iife!

254
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:20,523
Do you know the feeling
when you cook your own food..

255
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:22,997
..make your own money, and spend.

256
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,472
Live a life you've made for yourself..?

257
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,371
Independence! Know what I mean?

258
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:31,606
No..

259
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,178
Forget it.

260
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:35,711
But what are you going to do here?

261
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,710
I'll work, what else?
Do you know this magazine?

262
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,589
Mumbai Beat. Of course!
It has great photographs!

263
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:46,958
And good articles too.

264
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,995
I'm going to their office tomorrow,
for an interview.

265
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,837
Aah.. Of course! That diary at the party..

266
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,235
You're a writer, aren't you?

267
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:02,826
Well, not professionally.
But soon, I hope..

268
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,000
So Sidharth,
tell me something about Bombay.

269
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,109
What would you like to know?

270
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,569
If there was one place in Bombay you..

271
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,588
..could show me tonight,
what would that be?

272
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:30,637
The sea has always been really
special for Bombay, hasn't it?

273
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:34,240
I guess I can see why..

274
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:38,076
..In a city where anything
and everything can change,..

275
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,376
..the sea is a constant.

276
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:44,521
It'll always be here. It's beautiful.

277
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:49,900
Actually Aisha, you should see
the sea when it rains.

278
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,100
The Bombay monsoons are to die for!

279
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:56,868
People might complain
about the traffic and the flooding..

280
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,036
but, I just love the monsoons.

281
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:03,626
When it rains,
the sea looks amazing!

282
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:08,636
I can stare at it for hours..
it's really awesome.

283
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:14,081
Wow.. I'm going to remember that..

284
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:20,108
Can I ask you something, Aisha?

285
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,421
How can you still have more questions?

286
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:23,723
Ask..

287
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:27,730
You're all alone here, aren't you scared?

288
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,598
Are you kidding Sidharth? I'm terrified!

289
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,674
I've never lived alone before.

290
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,280
But you know what.. I'll get over it.

291
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:44,009
Coming to Bombay was a dream.

292
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:47,779
And now that it's actually coming true.
I can't let fear stand in my way.

293
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:53,000
There's so much to do that
I won't have time to be afraid!

294
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:58,964
Well.. I think you're
really tough, Aisha.. really.

295
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,005
I can't even imagine doing
what you're doing.

296
00:25:04,441 --> 00:25:06,741
So, I guess, cheers to your dream!

297
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:08,903
Cheers.

298
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:17,215
.. my father made a fortune

299
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:19,231
manufacturing bathroom
furnishings here..

300
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:23,293
It's quite an impressive story,
but 'flower showers'!

301
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:24,627
I mean isn't that ridiculous?

302
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,900
Well this is me..
Single Women's Hostel!

303
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:32,934
So, when can I call you?

304
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:36,366
Actually, I don't have a phone yet.

305
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:39,395
Sidharth, I don't wanna
keep saying this but..

306
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:42,061
I really don't want to
give you the wrong idea..

307
00:25:42,547 --> 00:25:46,108
God, I get it! I have
the same idea as you.

308
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,745
That we should be.. friends.

309
00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:53,468
Friends is great..
Why don't you give me your email lD?

310
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:54,957
Pen?
- Right there..

311
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:58,221
Sidharth..

312
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:01,366
You're my first friend in Bombay.

313
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:05,179
Sid.. friends call me Sid.

314
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:07,900
Thanks for tonight, Sid..

315
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:29,555
What are you doing in there?

316
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,295
Sir got tired of waiting
for you and left already..

317
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:34,057
Stop bugging me, Chhotu!
I just need 5 more minutes, Ok?

318
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:11,234
Yes? How can I help you?

319
00:27:13,442 --> 00:27:14,842
Mr. Ram Mehra..?

320
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:18,677
Sir is out. And you are..?

321
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:22,050
I'm his son.. Sid.. Sidharth..

322
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,835
Oh?! Sorry! I'm really very sorry!

323
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,512
How nice to see you
in the office Mr. Mehra!

324
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:30,184
Er.. call me Sid?

325
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,592
Ok, Mr. Mehra. Please come.

326
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:42,662
You're so whipped, dude!

327
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,907
She's your girlfriend,
not your boss! Be a man!

328
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,912
Oh hi pa! Rishi I'll have
to call you back..

329
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:53,975
Okay, bye.

330
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,006
Can we start work now, Sid?

331
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,859
Of course pa, that's why I'm here..

332
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:04,377
Ok then Sid! This is going to
be your last pizza in my cabin.

333
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:08,989
In fact, you won't even be
allowed in here without my permission.

334
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:10,492
This is not our house Sidharth.

335
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:13,465
This is my office. And we have
rules here. Is that clear?

336
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:18,869
You will work outside,
with rest of my staff.

337
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:22,333
And because you know nothing
about Mehra Furnishings.

338
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:25,043
You'll have to read
company's literature.

339
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:26,550
You will have to read up
on the company's background..

340
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:30,548
..our locations, our turnover,
our clients.. everything.

341
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:31,557
Okay?

342
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:37,702
By next Tuesday, you have to pick
a department to work for.

343
00:28:38,898 --> 00:28:40,589
This might all seem
a little dull to you at first..

344
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:43,391
..but eventually, it'll get interesting.

345
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:46,354
Lastly, you are not
my spoilt son in here Sid..

346
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,170
..but a young boy
with a chance to understand..

347
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:54,179
..the workings of a very big company.

348
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:56,206
Consider yourself lucky.

349
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:26,402
Hello 'my first Bombay friend'.
How are you?

350
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:30,309
I was thinking about you today..
so, here I am!

351
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,267
Anyhow, the news is..

352
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:35,888
I went in to the magazine office
for my first interview today..

353
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:38,552
..and Sid.. it was amazing!

354
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,700
Some places have such character..

355
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:43,723
..that you immediately
identify with them.

356
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,480
Do you know that feeling?

357
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:48,132
I had a meeting
with the Creative Director.

358
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,969
It went off quite well actually.

359
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,281
Amit is also Head Photographer there.

360
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,894
Didn't you say that you liked
the photographs in this magazine?

361
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,437
If I get this job,
you should come visit sometime.

362
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:05,419
My final interview is in a few days.
Keeping my fingers crossed!

363
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:09,618
That's it for now. Aisha.

364
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,056
Hello 'new girl in the city'.

365
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:17,764
Good to know that you had
an interesting day.

366
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:21,062
Because I just had the
worst day of my life!

367
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,706
Dad's office is a prison!

368
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:29,345
The people around me come
to work at the same time..

369
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:31,898
..Ieave at the same time.

370
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,845
I think they even
wear the same clothes!

371
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:37,050
Don't they get bored?!

372
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:40,789
You're so lucky you're not stuck with a
thousand pages of tax returns!

373
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:42,682
Later, Sid.

374
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:48,523
Dear Sid, I'm sorry that
you're not enjoying work

375
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:52,494
But I'm sure it'll get better..
Just keep at it.

376
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:54,329
Take me for instance.

377
00:30:55,006 --> 00:30:58,339
Remember how scared I was
when I first came to Bombay?

378
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:03,205
I couldn't even take
a walk by myself! And now..

379
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:05,742
I've been all over the city, Sid!

380
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:06,626
Everywhere!

381
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:10,400
I wake up and walk out.

382
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,500
Without thinking about
where I'm going or what I'm doing..

383
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,625
just aimlessly walking.

384
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:20,421
And the funny thing is
that I don't feel scared anymore.

385
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,495
In fact, these days,
I feel like I'm finally..

386
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,369
Free!

387
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:28,534
And then.. Iast night..

388
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:45,349
I can't live here anymore!

389
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:49,635
It's time I found
a place of my own. Till then.

390
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:51,021
Aisha.

391
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,291
Ma..

392
00:31:53,901 --> 00:31:57,159
Ma.. do you have a good housing
broker's number?

393
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:02,368
900888000. That's the number
for Prem Dubey

394
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:04,477
The best broker in Bombay.

395
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:07,544
Also, it's time you got a phone..

396
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:11,174
..so I could invite you to
rocking parties! Ok bye!

397
00:32:32,942 --> 00:32:37,903
Sid. It's Tuesday.
I'll see you in my cabin in half an hour.

398
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:38,838
Get up!

399
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:57,991
Thank you so much
for Dube-ji's number Sid.

400
00:32:58,285 --> 00:33:00,629
You're a saviour!
I'm going to look at flats today.

401
00:33:01,004 --> 00:33:01,862
Wish me luck..

402
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:24,788
Make sure everything
is delivered by tomorrow.

403
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:26,161
Yes, sir.
- You can go.

404
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,988
Let's go, Sid..

405
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:31,143
He left, Sir..

406
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,579
Mrs. D'Monte..

407
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:48,411
Yes?

408
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:51,449
I just wanted to see your flat.
Mr. Dubey told me..

409
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,290
So why the hell are
you bothering me?

410
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,110
Didn't Dubey tell you that they
keys are with Sonia on the fourth floor?!

411
00:33:57,696 --> 00:34:00,194
That idiot.
Take them from Sonia!

412
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:02,524
Where do these people come from..

413
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:09,934
Hi? Sid? Sid! Oh my God!
What are you doing here?

414
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,873
Me? I'm.. stalking you!

415
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,240
Shut up! You're kidding, right?

416
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:21,309
Yeah man. I called Dubey
and he told me you'd be here.

417
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:22,446
So I thought I'd come and help you.

418
00:34:22,823 --> 00:34:23,881
Oh how sweet!

419
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:31,221
So this is where Dubey has sent you,
- Yes. - That idiot!

420
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:34,865
This building doesn't
even have a watchman, or a lift!

421
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,997
And this gate,
it belongs in a museum!

422
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:41,573
Aisha? Aisha!

423
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:53,743
Shit! Mrs. D'Monte never
told me Sonia's flat number.

424
00:34:55,924 --> 00:35:03,158
God, I can't climb four
floors again! You do it..

425
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,598
401. Sonia Gill stays in flat 401.

426
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:13,669
You've come to see the flat,
haven't you?

427
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:14,901
Just one minute.

428
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,841
Oh Sanju.. it's you..

429
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,560
Hi.. they've come to see the flat..

430
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,500
Aww.. have they now?

431
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:42,065
Sanju.. Sanju! - Ok, bye. - Get in here!!
Stay away from that tramp!!

432
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:43,729
That old dried-up prune!!

433
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,411
Oh, so you're interested
in the flat, are you?

434
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:01,716
Actually, I am. Hi, I'm Aisha.

435
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,546
Anyway, I should warn you.
The flat's really dirty.

436
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,425
No one stayed here since a year.

437
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:11,131
Mrs. D'Monte can't climb up the stairs..

438
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,161
..so there's been zero maintenance.

439
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,367
Aisha.. it's like a haunted house in here.

440
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,676
Let's go. This place is a 'dump'.

441
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:48,884
Sid.. you're going to
think that I'm crazy..

442
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:50,134
Why?

443
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,007
Because I actually like this flat..

444
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,011
What?! That's impossible!

445
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,138
I'm taking it, Sid..

446
00:36:59,186 --> 00:37:01,077
But Aisha, it's filthy..

447
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:02,894
So we'll clean it..

448
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,400
You know, Chhotu's room is
bigger than this.. I swear..

449
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:08,885
Well, good for Chhotu!
I'm taking this flat.

450
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:11,271
But this is the first flat we've seen.
We could keep looking!

451
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:14,790
Of course we could..
but we won't! I've made up my mind!

452
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:18,096
You know what? You are right..

453
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,030
You really ARE crazy!

454
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,807
Where are you off to now?

455
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:25,437
To check out my building's terrace!

456
00:37:25,763 --> 00:37:26,471
'MY' building?

457
00:37:26,894 --> 00:37:27,572
Aisha wait..

458
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,048
Are you really sure
you wanna live here?

459
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,356
If it's about money,
maybe I can help you..

460
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,848
I'll ask dad for some.

461
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,801
Sid, that's really sweet.
But no thanks!

462
00:37:48,537 --> 00:37:53,016
God,you're so stubborn! Listen, I don't
think this area's very safe.

463
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:56,935
Why don't I do some research
and send you an email?

464
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:01,178
Aisha,listen, you're not from here,
you don't..

465
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,357
What a city!

466
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:18,863
Sid, do you really
want to help me?

467
00:38:19,753 --> 00:38:24,163
Then help me turn
this 'dump' into a home.. Yeah?

468
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,399
Your credit card statement..

469
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:36,702
It's been taken care of.

470
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:01,893
Happy Happy Anniversary
to you Sarita!

471
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:03,062
Thank you so much!

472
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:06,326
You look so gorgeous!

473
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:07,684
This is my wedding saree.

474
00:42:08,658 --> 00:42:10,638
Sorry l' m late.
- Hello Sid.

475
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:16,608
Look at you! How handsome!
You should become a film star!!

476
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,513
You are handsomest,my son!

477
00:42:24,725 --> 00:42:26,852
I'm also feeling that
you should become a film star.

478
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,060
You sit around doing nothing anyway..

479
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:31,628
Ma! Stop it!

480
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:35,027
Congratulations.. On the anniversary..
Madam Mehra!

481
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:39,439
Thanks. - This is my Mrs.
and my daughter Tanya.

482
00:42:41,022 --> 00:42:43,994
Ram, Tanya just
got back from the US.

483
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:47,727
She was getting a design
degree at Parson's University.

484
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:48,927
She's brilliant!

485
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:54,305
I told her to join my company,
but she says she is still thinking..

486
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,023
This generation, I tell you..

487
00:42:57,142 --> 00:43:00,097
Wants to be independent..
right, Sidharth?

488
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:05,291
Sidharth?! Made any plans
for your future yet?

489
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:16,193
Excuse me.. Hello. Aisha?
What's up? When did you get a phone?!

490
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:21,062
Busy man! So, Mehra, your son's
all grown up now, huh?

491
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:23,751
When is he taking
over your business?

492
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:29,281
Who knows?
He's also still thinking..

493
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:39,330
Hi. - Hey, thanks Aisha.. you keep
rescuing me from every boring party.

494
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:43,992
By the way, you were right.
The flat's looking really nice.

495
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:53,578
So Aisha..
it's the middle of the night..

496
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:58,655
you and me.. alone in your apartment..
what's going on?

497
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,191
Sid.. I feel silly saying this..

498
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,951
..but I just didn't want
to be alone tonight.

499
00:44:06,197 --> 00:44:09,524
You see, tomorrow,
well in ten minutes actually..

500
00:44:10,235 --> 00:44:14,704
It's my birthday! I've never been
alone on my birthday before..

501
00:44:16,374 --> 00:44:17,700
Your birthday!?
Why didn't you tell me before?

502
00:44:17,842 --> 00:44:19,800
We would have gone out
and really partied!

503
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:21,169
Well, this is kind of a party, isn't it?

504
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:23,443
You, me and two cups of tea?

505
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,380
Yeah.. but something's still missing.

506
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:30,598
What?

507
00:44:31,624 --> 00:44:33,119
We still have ten minutes
though, don't we? - Yes.

508
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:34,250
Ok then!

509
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:45,006
Sid, this is so stupid!
What are you doing?

510
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:47,130
Don't turn around, Aisha.

511
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,073
You better not be
messing up my kitchen!

512
00:44:52,512 --> 00:44:55,841
No no, it's very clean.
Spotless.. just give me ten seconds

513
00:45:49,822 --> 00:45:50,630
Thank you Sid.

514
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:52,799
What for?

515
00:45:53,993 --> 00:45:55,872
You've done so much for me.

516
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:58,646
If there's ever anything
I can do in return, just ask, ok?

517
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:00,697
Anything?

518
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:04,782
Ok, not 'anything'!
You're a good friend, Sid.

519
00:46:11,127 --> 00:46:12,285
Can I ask you something, Aisha?

520
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:13,687
Ask away..

521
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:19,196
You and l.. we've become friends now,
which is great.

522
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,661
But if you think about it..

523
00:46:23,038 --> 00:46:27,570
..we could've become more than friends..

524
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:30,945
So, why do you think
that never happened?

525
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:37,420
Sid! It just didn't.
We're better off as friends, anyway.

526
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:39,950
Besides, I didn't really think...

527
00:46:40,124 --> 00:46:43,293
I could fall in love with someone
like you.. That's why..

528
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:47,129
Why not?
I mean, I'm kinda perfect.

529
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:52,998
No seriously Aisha..
what's wrong with me?

530
00:46:54,205 --> 00:46:56,039
There's nothing wrong with you..

531
00:46:56,808 --> 00:46:59,971
Sid, I don't want to talk about this.
You'll feel bad..

532
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:03,937
Why would I feel bad?
It's not as if I'm in love with you!

533
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:05,748
Come on, we can talk about this..

534
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:12,990
Ok! I think.. you're still a kid.

535
00:47:14,627 --> 00:47:17,721
A bit immature.. childish.

536
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:20,628
You're just not what I'm looking for.

537
00:47:22,044 --> 00:47:26,100
Ok, this is going to be fun!
What are you looking for, Aisha?

538
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,732
I guess someone who is..
independent, for starters..

539
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:34,570
Someone with a career,
a goal in life.

540
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,273
Somebody I can relate to.

541
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:41,712
In short, a MAN.. not a boy!

542
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,002
Basically, the exact opposite of me!

543
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:50,419
Basically.. You're the
wrong profile for me, Sid.

544
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,663
Actually, you're right.
I'm too young for you.

545
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:03,507
You should go out with
someone your own age.

546
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:05,000
I knew you were going to feel bad!

547
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,213
By the way,
how old do you think I am?

548
00:48:07,795 --> 00:48:08,373
Thirty.

549
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:10,649
Seriously?!
- Yeah..

550
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,716
Look,I'm 27.
And if you bug me any more,

551
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:13,986
I'm throwing you off this terrace..

552
00:48:14,155 --> 00:48:18,658
Relax! I was just kidding!
Come now, make a birthday wish.

553
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:22,253
What birthday wish..
I just hope I get this job..

554
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:28,360
You're next.

555
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:15,743
Vidhi Nayak?

556
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,878
Aisha Bannerjee.

557
00:49:17,304 --> 00:49:22,992
Aisha Bannerjee.. Right.
You've already had an interview here?

558
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:24,549
Then why wait 2 weeks
for the second one?

559
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:27,363
Uhh, you were busy,
Sir.. That's why..

560
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:29,728
Oh yes of course..
I was busy.

561
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:35,763
But, you know.. Well, you should
know that I'm a very busy man.

562
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,271
My last assistant, Edna..

563
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,802
She was brilliant.
Absolutely brilliant.

564
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:43,304
And then she had to go
and get brilliantly pregnant!

565
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:47,797
My bad luck, I suppose.
And your good luck!

566
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:53,790
So, Aisha Bannerjee, your
application letter seems interesting..

567
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:55,224
But your resume is pretty weak.

568
00:49:55,795 --> 00:49:58,260
Two months at the
Calcutta State Library? That's it?

569
00:49:58,397 --> 00:50:01,027
Yeah but I was also the editor
for my college newspaper for 2 years!

570
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:03,592
I'm talking about actual experience.

571
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:05,068
Serious work.. Iike we do here.

572
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:08,572
I am a workaholic. I'm extremely
hard to work for, Ms. Bannerjee.

573
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:10,159
I'm not sure you can keep up.

574
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:11,507
Of course..I can, Sir.

575
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:13,942
I've come here all the way
from Calcutta only to become a writer..

576
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:15,679
I will learn much from you.

577
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:21,812
Writer? Why did you apply for this job
if you wanted to become a writer?

578
00:50:21,988 --> 00:50:24,312
An assistant's work is very clerical.

579
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,153
Cleaning up my desk
doesn't require any creativity.

580
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:29,491
Besides, this is a magazine
about Bombay..

581
00:50:29,563 --> 00:50:30,562
..and you're not even from here..

582
00:50:30,731 --> 00:50:33,129
But, you weren't from Bombay
either when you joined this magazine.

583
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,311
And now you're
the Chief Editor here.

584
00:50:36,837 --> 00:50:38,445
I know everything about you.

585
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:42,238
Actually,I applied for this job
after a lot of deliberation.

586
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:44,211
In fact, I've pictured you giving me....

587
00:50:44,379 --> 00:50:45,523
.. this interview
a thousand times already.

588
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:47,638
I just didn't imagine
that I'd be this nervous..

589
00:50:47,715 --> 00:50:49,172
..and you'd be this good looking..

590
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:59,450
Believe me.. I'll clean your
desk very creatively.

591
00:51:00,996 --> 00:51:03,697
God knows, it needs
a good cleaning.

592
00:51:09,615 --> 00:51:11,266
Sid! I've got it..

593
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,772
The editor's new assistant
at Mumbai Beat is Aisha Bannerjee!

594
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:16,544
I finally have a job!

595
00:51:16,746 --> 00:51:19,881
Aisha.. that's great.. Super!

596
00:51:21,784 --> 00:51:25,215
Can I call you in a bit?
I'm a little busy right now..

597
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:28,215
Okay. Bye.

598
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:40,499
What?! Stressed spelled
backwards is desserts.

599
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,504
I'm stressed!
And where were you guys?!

600
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:43,500
Never on time..

601
00:51:43,707 --> 00:51:48,391
Baby, I passed I passed!
I got more than 40 in every subject!!

602
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:51,476
I thought I'd get like 35!
I'm so happy I passed!

603
00:51:51,749 --> 00:51:53,273
That's like.. third class..

604
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,577
Whatever, at least I passed.
Come on hurry up you guys..

605
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:08,689
Guys,As per plan.. one by one.. 

606
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,358
You go first.

607
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:11,593
Sure? Ok..

608
00:52:14,606 --> 00:52:15,437
Here.. here.

609
00:52:24,116 --> 00:52:26,483
You're a genius Laxmi!
You're probably one of the toppers.

610
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:29,011
I don't know, man.
I could've done better in Economics..

611
00:52:32,324 --> 00:52:33,082
Where's mine.

612
00:52:37,629 --> 00:52:39,159
Please God, let me pass
this one last time.

613
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,390
I'll walk barefoot to the temple
every week if you do. Please..

614
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:48,002
Hey Rishi.. you did it!
You passed!

615
00:52:49,742 --> 00:52:52,267
I passed Sid! I passed!

616
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:56,093
Sid, let's check yours now..

617
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,031
Maybe we're looking at the
wrong number, lets check again..

618
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:18,896
Sid,show me your exam card..

619
00:53:32,018 --> 00:53:33,244
Rishi,where have you been?

620
00:53:33,354 --> 00:53:36,514
Baby you passed!
Aren't you proud of yourself?

621
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:37,289
I know baby.. But..

622
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:48,783
Sid! Don't worry dude.
It's going to be alright.

623
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,603
Sid, listen.

624
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:53,105
These things happen, Sid..

625
00:53:55,644 --> 00:53:59,847
It's just one year, Sid.
You'll pass next year..

626
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:01,510
It's not that big a deal!

627
00:54:01,724 --> 00:54:02,542
Damn you, Rishi!

628
00:54:03,753 --> 00:54:06,620
Don't tell me that its not a
big deal just because you passed!

629
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:08,716
I don't need a lecture from you.

630
00:54:09,692 --> 00:54:11,583
Okay Sid, but relax Sid..

631
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:12,819
How can you tell me to relax?

632
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:14,990
I thought we were in this together.

633
00:54:15,698 --> 00:54:21,200
Now you've gone and passed
and I've.. I'm alone here.

634
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:26,034
Yeah but.. why are you
taking this out on me?

635
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:27,904
Because it's all your fault!

636
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:30,609
You didn't deserve to pass either,
and you know it!

637
00:54:31,715 --> 00:54:33,792
Maybe if I hadn't wasted my time with you,
I would have passed too.

638
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:36,381
Screw you Sid..

639
00:54:36,794 --> 00:54:38,346
You're right,you too Rishi!

640
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:40,454
Stop fighting guys..
Sid we could reevaluate the papers..

641
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:41,683
Laxmi please leave me alone.

642
00:54:56,675 --> 00:55:00,655
Siddy.. me cooking tonight.
Are you eating at home?

643
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,238
What happen, Siddy?

644
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:06,817
Are you in a bad mood?
Do you need money?

645
00:55:12,224 --> 00:55:13,182
What happened?

646
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:17,594
Maa.. My results are out.

647
00:55:27,306 --> 00:55:31,267
Sid? You didn't passed?

648
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:37,673
How could you let this happen,
Sidharth?!

649
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,779
This is because you waste all 
your time roaming around..with your friends!

650
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:46,956
You were such
a good student in school..

651
00:55:47,794 --> 00:55:49,623
What happened in college?

652
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:54,392
We give you everything
you want, don't we?

653
00:55:55,257 --> 00:55:58,506
Then why?
Say something Sidharth..

654
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,354
Did I do something wrong..
you failed.

655
00:56:01,455 --> 00:56:04,933
Shut up Ma! Stop this
stupid melodramatic lecture!

656
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,678
I know exactly what happened.
There's no need to keep reminding me.

657
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,551
I'll pass next year.
Why are you panicking?

658
00:56:12,253 --> 00:56:14,600
Why do you care so much anyway?

659
00:56:14,723 --> 00:56:16,190
You didn't even go to school..

660
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:25,691
Say you're sorry, Sid..

661
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,003
I said apologize, Sidharth.

662
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:31,344
Please don't interfere in this, Dad.

663
00:56:35,411 --> 00:56:36,369
Don't interfere?

664
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,110
And continue to ignore what an ungrateful..
..spoilt brat you've become!

665
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:42,008
How dare you speak
to your mother like that!

666
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:46,779
Her life has revolved around you 
every single day of the last twenty years.

667
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:51,525
She couldn't go to school,
so she wanted you to do well.

668
00:56:52,195 --> 00:56:54,439
So you could get everything
she couldn't have..

669
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,455
Wow! Another lecture..

670
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,934
Sid! Don't you dare walk out!

671
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:04,179
You are going to stand there
and listen to me tonight.

672
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,805
When I was your age
my father was dead,

673
00:57:10,621 --> 00:57:16,598
I was married, and working day and night,
trying to make enough money

674
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,296
so that you can have
everything you have today.

675
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:22,450
This lifestyle.. this arrogance..

676
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,157
So what do you want from me?
Do you want me to be grateful?

677
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:28,321
You're damn right.
The least you can do is be grateful!

678
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:29,860
Thank you so much, Pa.
There, I said it.

679
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:30,526
Now can I go?

680
00:57:30,902 --> 00:57:34,562
I am not done yet!
You can't just walk away from everything!

681
00:57:34,773 --> 00:57:37,298
This is exactly why you failed.

682
00:57:37,592 --> 00:57:39,656
Why you didn't last at the office
for more than a week!

683
00:57:39,794 --> 00:57:40,993
You ran away without
informing anyone.

684
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,470
Oh God.. Not again..
your office.. your company..

685
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:46,684
Can't you see? I don't care
about your stupid office!

686
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:48,683
Then what do you care about Sidharth?

687
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:51,288
What do you care about? 
You don't care about yourself..

688
00:57:51,356 --> 00:57:54,291
..about your family, about your future..

689
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,546
You're wasting your life Sidharth.

690
00:57:57,763 --> 00:58:00,298
Can't you see that today
you've failed your exams..

691
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:01,460
Tomorrow you're going to fail at life?

692
00:58:01,534 --> 00:58:04,159
No I can't see that!
And I don't want to see that!

693
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:05,902
I don't give a damn
about what you think!

694
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:09,273
You'll start caring
when I stop giving you money.

695
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:12,770
Do it then! I don't want
your bloody money anyway!

696
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:17,907
Ok, Sidharth.
Let me clarify one thing.

697
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:24,982
This is MY house,
and if you want to live in it..

698
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:28,750
..you'll have to live by my rules. Ok?

699
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,162
I don't want to live in your
damn house then! I'm leaving.

700
00:59:44,808 --> 00:59:48,403
Sid? What are you doing here?

701
00:59:50,614 --> 00:59:51,808
Can I stay with you?

702
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:58,388
What? Sid?
Ok, why don't come in first..

703
01:00:07,064 --> 01:00:08,326
What's wrong, Sid?

704
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,411
Chhotu! Chhotu!

705
01:01:39,757 --> 01:01:41,418
Shut these bloody curtains, Chhotu!!

706
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:43,452
Chhotu!!

707
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:48,460
Kabir overlooks all the writing..

708
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:50,723
I'm so sorry..

709
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:56,127
So whenever the articles come in..

710
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:03,438
Aisha! Where were you?
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

711
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,808
Were you so busy?

712
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:09,650
I tried and tried and tried..

713
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:17,858
I got so bored today.

714
01:03:19,133 --> 01:03:21,465
And you should really get an AC..
it's so hot in here!

715
01:03:25,174 --> 01:03:26,368
Aisha, you're not even listening to me!

716
01:03:27,444 --> 01:03:30,174
Sid, I was working all day.
I'm really tired, ok?

717
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:35,175
Ok.. Iet's go out for dinner then.

718
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:38,782
I don't want to go, Sid.
I ate at the office.

719
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:40,982
I just need to clean this up, and..

720
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,691
You ate already? Without me?

721
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:48,256
Yeah! You're not my husband!

722
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:51,127
Just cook something for yourself,
I'm going to bed.

723
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,999
You don't know how to cook, do you?

724
01:03:59,445 --> 01:04:03,375
You can't cook anything?
Then what did you eat today?

725
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:07,425
Shit, Sid, you haven't eaten anything all day?!

726
01:04:07,703 --> 01:04:09,034
Why didn't you just order something?

727
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:11,764
I didn't feel like it..

728
01:04:13,543 --> 01:04:14,601
Hungry?

729
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:17,737
Yeah..

730
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,679
You're so silly, Sid!
Why didn't you tell me!

731
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:21,007
I'll make you something.

732
01:04:48,496 --> 01:04:49,732
Aisha, my coffee..

733
01:04:50,114 --> 01:04:51,376
Yes, just a second.

734
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:59,097
Kabir.. If you got a moment..
I wrote this and wanted your feedback..

735
01:04:59,225 --> 01:05:02,022
Aisha, can I please get my coffee?

736
01:05:32,992 --> 01:05:35,486
Sir, your card has been declined..

737
01:05:37,637 --> 01:05:38,855
Are you sure?

738
01:05:39,008 --> 01:05:40,256
Yes sir.

739
01:05:42,668 --> 01:05:44,533
Would you like to pay cash?

740
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:46,162
Yes.

741
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:52,636
Actually..

742
01:05:52,713 --> 01:05:54,580
That's ok.. I'll get it..

743
01:05:56,217 --> 01:05:57,708
Debbie, that's really sweet of you..

744
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,214
Thank you so much.
I'll pay you back..

745
01:06:00,388 --> 01:06:01,446
Sidharth it's Ok.

746
01:06:01,956 --> 01:06:05,284
Save the grateful speech for another time.
It doesn't suit you.

747
01:06:07,395 --> 01:06:11,295
Anyway, I just got a job
so I'm treating all my friends to lunch.

748
01:06:12,834 --> 01:06:15,596
Not exactly friends, are we?

749
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:18,063
No.. Not exactly..

750
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:25,311
I'm sorry that you failed, Sidharth.
Just wanted to say that.

751
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,779
Hey Debbie,
why do you hate me so much?

752
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:37,383
Three years ago,
I came to Bombay to join our college.

753
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:40,729
I had the right grades,
but I was late with my application.

754
01:06:41,848 --> 01:06:44,430
I didn't get in that year. You know why?

755
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,067
Because you took my seat, Sidharth.

756
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:51,739
Your father called a few people,
and you got the last seat in the batch.

757
01:06:54,495 --> 01:07:01,045
I am smarter, I work harder,
and I'm more deserving than you.

758
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:06,345
But life has always been easier for you,
hasn't it?

759
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:09,284
Bye, Sid.

760
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:37,818
But Sid,
you have to go home some time!

761
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,054
He cancelled my credit card, Laxmi.

762
01:07:40,526 --> 01:07:42,084
There's no way l' m going back now.

763
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,258
But he's just angry, Sid.
You need to understand..

764
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,797
You're the one
who doesn't understand, Laxmi!

765
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:47,925
You topped the whole damn college.

766
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,259
How can you know
what it feels like to have failed?

767
01:07:50,736 --> 01:07:51,794
Just leave me alone!

768
01:07:52,472 --> 01:07:56,800
Oh Shut up, Sid!
I don't know what it feels like to fail?!

769
01:07:57,143 --> 01:08:00,010
Look at me.. I'm fat as a whale!

770
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:06,676
I keep trying to lose weight
but I fail every single day!

771
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:10,678
You're not the only one with problems,
so stop being a jerk!

772
01:08:18,832 --> 01:08:21,194
Wipe that silly look off your face!

773
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:29,241
Ok, fine.. I know I'm being a jerk!

774
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:31,302
It's just been tough, you know..

775
01:08:32,513 --> 01:08:36,643
I know. That's why I got this for you.

776
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:40,716
College application form.

777
01:08:43,225 --> 01:08:44,283
And..

778
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,518
Some of your things.

779
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:51,263
I knew you wouldn't go back home.

780
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,897
Just thought I'd try..

781
01:08:56,872 --> 01:09:01,540
Hey Laxmi.. I never knew, you know..

782
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:04,005
That your weight was such an issue
for you..

783
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:05,855
It's ok, Sid.

784
01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:10,842
You know
I don't think you're a whale, right?

785
01:09:14,057 --> 01:09:14,915
Maybe a shark!

786
01:11:04,805 --> 01:11:05,999
Sonia?

787
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:08,399
Yes Sid?

788
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:10,604
Do you know how to make eggs?

789
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:22,533
And call Karan and follow up with Amit.

790
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:23,849
Is that all?

791
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,624
Yeah, just get rid of all this stuff.

792
01:11:30,432 --> 01:11:33,076
Aisha, leave.

793
01:11:57,260 --> 01:11:58,222
You're not going to believe this..

794
01:12:01,598 --> 01:12:04,323
Why are so late today? I was waiting!

795
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:09,800
I made an egg for you!
Sonia taught me.

796
01:12:10,107 --> 01:12:11,074
You were right, she's so cool..

797
01:12:11,542 --> 01:12:14,868
Shut up Sid! Look at this mess..

798
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,679
You made an egg.
Wow! Congratulations!

799
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:21,436
And who is going to do those dishes?!
Your servant?

800
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:23,780
Or did you forget,
you don't have a servant anymore?!

801
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:29,349
This is my home Sid,
and you have turned it into a garbage dump!

802
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:32,521
But Aisha.. I made you an egg..

803
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,296
Sid.. I think you should go back home.

804
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:23,163
Your dad has such a successful company..

805
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:26,726
And you are sitting in my house
making eggs!

806
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:28,944
What are you doing Sid?

807
01:15:31,181 --> 01:15:36,851
You know.. You look at me
and you see my father's success..

808
01:15:38,055 --> 01:15:42,085
But I'm not like him, Aisha..
I went to his office for a week..

809
01:15:42,243 --> 01:15:45,794
But that place.. it just wasn't ME!

810
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:56,596
But I'm beginning to realize
I'm nobody without him.

811
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:04,609
I don't have an identity!

812
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:11,988
Which is why I decided last night
that I want to work.

813
01:16:14,193 --> 01:16:15,892
I know that I can't do anything.

814
01:16:16,428 --> 01:16:17,952
I don't know who would hire me.

815
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:22,498
All I know is that I want to work.

816
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:28,139
Aisha,please don't kick me out right now.

817
01:16:28,995 --> 01:16:31,438
Just give me one more chance. Please.

818
01:16:49,596 --> 01:16:51,687
Aisha, where were you last night?

819
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,858
At Sonia's.

820
01:16:54,969 --> 01:16:58,256
What,you mean.. across the hall?

821
01:17:03,477 --> 01:17:06,375
Sid, about that job.. I've got an idea.

822
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,226
Have you done any kind
of photography course?

823
01:17:15,957 --> 01:17:16,615
No..

824
01:17:17,192 --> 01:17:18,784
Any kind of work experience
with photography?

825
01:17:19,978 --> 01:17:20,586
No..

826
01:17:22,023 --> 01:17:23,215
Any kind of work experience at all?

827
01:17:26,034 --> 01:17:28,348
Amit, Sid's been taking photographs
for many years now.

828
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:31,298
Even as an intern,
he could learn a lot from you.

829
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:33,674
I truly think this is something
he'll be good at.

830
01:17:36,512 --> 01:17:41,313
Ok Sidharth.. Let's try you out
as an intern for a few days..

831
01:17:44,787 --> 01:17:45,345
Thanks Amit.

832
01:17:45,421 --> 01:17:47,386
See you at 10 tomorrow.

833
01:17:49,192 --> 01:17:52,157
But tomorrow is Sunday!
I mean, yeah..

834
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,695
I am going to be working
for Mumbai Beat.

835
01:17:57,968 --> 01:18:02,805
How totally neat! Hey, that rhymed.
Oh what heat!

836
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:05,941
We live together,
now we're going to work together.

837
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,198
Should we just get married?!

838
01:18:07,344 --> 01:18:09,739
Yeah, let's go! Come on!

839
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,309
Go home, you idiot!

840
01:18:12,483 --> 01:18:13,814
4th Road Juhu Scheme please.
- Bye.

841
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:21,553
See you at home darling!

842
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:29,691
Stop here.

843
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,468
Why did you bring me here? I said..

844
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,242
Sorry..

845
01:18:43,481 --> 01:18:45,142
Turn around. We'll go to Chapel road.

846
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,350
One second.
Wait here, I'll be right back.

847
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:18,913
He listened to the conversation between..

848
01:19:19,586 --> 01:19:24,920
The Chief of guards
and the king with great attention.

849
01:19:26,226 --> 01:19:31,430
Why? What did the poor fellow do?
The King inquired.

850
01:19:35,569 --> 01:19:39,505
Hello everybody, welcome to Mumbai Beat!
- Thank you.

851
01:19:40,925 --> 01:19:43,870
The theme of our next issue is
Bazaars of Mumbai.

852
01:19:44,879 --> 01:19:48,262
Now,I'm sure you guys know all these markets..
....well most of them.

853
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,818
The idea is that there will be two interns
for every three articles,

854
01:19:54,022 --> 01:19:57,100
except for the cover story.
So let's give out some work..

855
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,523
You're Ram Mehra's son, right?

856
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:04,026
We met at your parents' anniversary party,
remember?

857
01:20:05,537 --> 01:20:07,134
Oh yeah.. Hi.

858
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:16,736
So, I'm guessing you didn't join
your dad's company then..

859
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,076
Tanya Lathia? Design intern.

860
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:20,206
That's me.

861
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:21,241
Sid Mehra?

862
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:24,682
You two are going to assist me
on the cover story photo spread.

863
01:20:25,755 --> 01:20:27,013
And you are?
- Rasha.

864
01:20:27,106 --> 01:20:29,183
Rasha.. you are also design intern.

865
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:31,189
What do you want to do?
What you want to design?

866
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:35,230
Sid?! Hold on, l' m coming..

867
01:20:40,237 --> 01:20:40,905
Yes.

868
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:43,594
I'm Sidharth's mother.

869
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:48,043
Oh.. Hello auntie..

870
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,238
Can I come in?

871
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:52,114
Of course, please come in.

872
01:21:09,534 --> 01:21:11,165
Actually.. Sid isn't here..

873
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,439
I know. I had asked Chhotu
to call me once he left.

874
01:21:18,176 --> 01:21:21,334
I just wanted to see
where Sid was living these days.

875
01:21:24,249 --> 01:21:26,581
Now that he's staying with you..

876
01:21:27,452 --> 01:21:28,819
I thought you might need some money..

877
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:31,884
No auntie, please..
I can't take money from you..

878
01:21:32,524 --> 01:21:33,582
Thank you.

879
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,108
I brought some mangoes too..
they're Sidharth's favourite..

880
01:21:39,665 --> 01:21:40,623
At least keep those.

881
01:21:41,994 --> 01:21:42,692
Ok.

882
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:46,463
Yes, put it here.

883
01:21:47,567 --> 01:21:51,270
Just don't tell him I got them.
He won't like it.

884
01:21:53,506 --> 01:21:56,108
Ok Aisha, I will take your leave.

885
01:21:58,001 --> 01:21:58,659
Auntie..

886
01:22:01,104 --> 01:22:03,115
I just wanted to say..

887
01:22:04,057 --> 01:22:06,482
I mean,
I hope you don't get the wrong idea..

888
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:12,457
Actually, Sid and l,
there's nothing going on between us..

889
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:16,159
You know,..We're.. we're just friends..

890
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:16,451
Thank God we have tomorrow off.
I really need a break.

891
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:18,520
Let's go out to dinner tonight.

892
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:22,098
I can't tonight.. I already made plans.

893
01:26:22,894 --> 01:26:24,695
Really? What plans?

894
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:27,487
You know Tanya?
I'm going out with her.

895
01:26:28,499 --> 01:26:33,336
Tanya? That design intern?
She's pretty, haan?

896
01:26:34,072 --> 01:26:36,065
Yeah she's pretty.. and fun too.

897
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:39,733
We're going clubbing..
Why don't you join us?

898
01:26:39,811 --> 01:26:40,369
It'll be fun!

899
01:26:40,645 --> 01:26:42,610
No, you go.
I don't want to go clubbing.

900
01:26:45,484 --> 01:26:47,449
But you'll get bored, all alone at home..

901
01:26:47,986 --> 01:26:49,008
I'll just cancel the whole thing.

902
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:50,812
Don't be silly! You should go.

903
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:53,083
Don't worry about me.
I've got a lot going on.

904
01:26:53,158 --> 01:26:54,016
Really!

905
01:26:58,527 --> 01:27:02,024
Up for a drink?
I didn't have anything going on, so..

906
01:27:02,295 --> 01:27:04,795
I'm always up for a drink darling!
Come.

907
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,171
What's up?

908
01:27:08,561 --> 01:27:10,275
Sid, this is my best friend, Saira..

909
01:27:10,543 --> 01:27:13,005
Hello! I've heard a lot about you!
- Oh, you have?

910
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:15,989
Tanya.. Vikram. Come here.

911
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,779
Sid man! - Bro.
- Where have you been?

912
01:27:18,852 --> 01:27:19,810
Back in action now brother..

913
01:27:19,836 --> 01:27:21,180
You totally disappeared..
- Actually..

914
01:27:21,254 --> 01:27:23,313
Sid!! What are you doing here?

915
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:26,791
Wow, he knows everyone here..
Anyway, have you met Rishi?

916
01:27:27,694 --> 01:27:28,920
Tanya! - Hey..
- Hi.

917
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:36,227
Hey Rish..

918
01:27:36,504 --> 01:27:39,771
Hi Sid. Do you want another drink?

919
01:27:48,816 --> 01:27:50,010
What the hell are you watching?!

920
01:27:50,118 --> 01:27:50,776
Hey..

921
01:27:51,002 --> 01:27:54,212
Come, let's gossip..
How's your sex life?!

922
01:27:55,056 --> 01:27:56,114
What?!

923
01:27:56,524 --> 01:28:00,091
Oh don't be such a prude!
What about your boss?

924
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:04,026
How's that going?
Do you still think he's sexy?

925
01:28:04,466 --> 01:28:05,024
Tell me.

926
01:28:05,817 --> 01:28:09,860
Yep, still sexy..
and he's my type too..

927
01:28:10,038 --> 01:28:11,096
Just jump him then!

928
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,170
Sonia! He's my boss!
And I don't even know him..

929
01:28:15,311 --> 01:28:16,069
And Sid?

930
01:28:16,946 --> 01:28:17,804
What about him?

931
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:20,847
You know him, don't you?
At least hook up with him!

932
01:28:21,133 --> 01:28:24,578
Please Sonia! We're just friends.
Plus, he's a kid!

933
01:28:25,254 --> 01:28:28,885
Oh what a cute kid!
I think he's quite sexy..

934
01:28:29,502 --> 01:28:32,525
You know, like those boy band singers..

935
01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:34,256
Sid? And sexy?

936
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:35,092
Yes.

937
01:28:35,765 --> 01:28:36,623
Of course!

938
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,031
Please.. not Sid!

939
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:39,259
Yeah!

940
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:43,366
Guys! Drinks?

941
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,598
Vodka Red Bull!

942
01:28:44,925 --> 01:28:46,033
Oooooh!

943
01:28:46,109 --> 01:28:47,776
Weird! I'll get them!

944
01:28:51,515 --> 01:28:52,939
Sid!!!

945
01:28:54,484 --> 01:28:55,742
Two Vodka Red Bulls please.

946
01:28:59,890 --> 01:29:00,548
Laxmi?

947
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:02,317
Sid?

948
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,688
Where did Rishi go?

949
01:29:05,396 --> 01:29:07,855
Why do you wanna know?
As if you care..

950
01:29:08,249 --> 01:29:09,157
He left.

951
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:11,632
Of course. For Neha's.

952
01:29:12,036 --> 01:29:13,503
No Sid! Why would he go there?

953
01:29:14,873 --> 01:29:15,731
Let it be.

954
01:29:16,374 --> 01:29:17,773
What?
- Nothing..

955
01:29:18,176 --> 01:29:19,234
Tell me.

956
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:28,081
Neha and Rishi broke up.
Nobody knows why or when..

957
01:29:28,347 --> 01:29:30,316
And that stupid Rishi won't talk about it..

958
01:29:31,523 --> 01:29:34,303
Poor thing. He's really upset.

959
01:29:34,593 --> 01:29:35,651
You know Rishi..

960
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,844
Hey Rish..

961
01:29:46,579 --> 01:29:47,617
Why didn't you call me?

962
01:29:51,878 --> 01:29:54,410
Rishi! What happened with Neha?

963
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:58,508
What happened man?!

964
01:30:09,897 --> 01:30:13,032
You gotta be kidding me..
And she said no?

965
01:30:14,935 --> 01:30:19,433
Not only that.. She dumped me, man..

966
01:30:31,603 --> 01:30:32,684
I'm a bloody idiot!

967
01:30:32,854 --> 01:30:34,112
You're a bloody idiot!

968
01:30:34,672 --> 01:30:36,053
You told me this would happen!

969
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:37,589
I told you this would happen!

970
01:30:37,926 --> 01:30:40,156
Then you should've been there
to remind me!

971
01:30:47,169 --> 01:30:50,602
Yeah man. I should've been there.

972
01:30:52,374 --> 01:30:53,632
Sorry.

973
01:31:14,063 --> 01:31:15,154
Sanju, have breakfast.

974
01:31:15,299 --> 01:31:16,157
Come on.

975
01:31:23,473 --> 01:31:25,407
Aisha! Good morning.

976
01:31:25,642 --> 01:31:26,600
Morning Sid.

977
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:36,180
Aisha? Why are we sitting
with the door open?

978
01:31:37,588 --> 01:31:38,682
Cross ventilation, Sid.

979
01:31:39,323 --> 01:31:41,587
There's no electricity in the flat.
It's really hot.

980
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:46,553
Just a few more days..
and the rain will be here.

981
01:31:48,032 --> 01:31:50,066
You don't know
how much you're going to love it.

982
01:31:57,642 --> 01:31:58,500
Aisha?

983
01:31:58,877 --> 01:31:59,795
What Sid?!

984
01:32:01,012 --> 01:32:04,905
This dress really suits you.
You're looking nice today.

985
01:32:07,005 --> 01:32:07,943
Don't I look nice everyday?

986
01:32:09,788 --> 01:32:10,746
Nope.

987
01:32:12,858 --> 01:32:15,558
No seriously..
you look a little extra nice today.

988
01:32:16,605 --> 01:32:17,353
Thanks Sid.

989
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:24,564
Aisha.. Sidharth..
I made my special Sunday breakfast today.

990
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:25,695
Do you want some?

991
01:32:25,772 --> 01:32:28,372
Yes, Mrs. Bapat. I'm always starving!

992
01:32:29,242 --> 01:32:34,739
Umm Sidharth.. will you take
Sanju's photographs today? Please?

993
01:32:35,048 --> 01:32:37,173
Of course, Mrs. Bapat.
Right after I polish off this food!

994
01:32:38,084 --> 01:32:39,042
Tell me if you want more.

995
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:40,377
Sure.

996
01:32:42,989 --> 01:32:44,047
Here.

997
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:45,582
Smile.

998
01:32:47,027 --> 01:32:48,260
Smile for me, Sanju!

999
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,188
Can I go play now?

1000
01:32:51,698 --> 01:32:55,494
Come, we'll play together.
Do you like cricket?

1001
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,637
Show me how you hit the ball!

1002
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:04,008
Lovely! Once again. 1.. 2.. 3! Superb.

1003
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,478
You're welcome, sir.

1004
01:33:15,156 --> 01:33:17,147
Sanju! Take one with just me and him,
Sidharth.

1005
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:18,749
Sure.
- Come.

1006
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:22,520
Sit here.

1007
01:33:24,676 --> 01:33:26,024
Smile Sanju!

1008
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:30,036
What happened?

1009
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,869
Why do you have to be so naughty, huh?

1010
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:36,944
He's taking such nice pictures.

1011
01:33:37,012 --> 01:33:40,575
Always up to mischief, my little brat.

1012
01:34:16,787 --> 01:34:17,567
Hi ma.

1013
01:34:22,359 --> 01:34:25,760
Thought dad would be
on his evening walk now..

1014
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:28,657
I'm going to leave before he gets back.

1015
01:34:30,702 --> 01:34:32,033
And I haven't come back to stay,

1016
01:34:33,171 --> 01:34:36,231
so we're not going to talk about that.
Ok?

1017
01:34:41,313 --> 01:34:44,143
I just.. wanted to see you.

1018
01:34:51,757 --> 01:34:52,615
I miss you ma..

1019
01:34:56,589 --> 01:35:00,665
Siddy.. in shirt you looking so handsome..

1020
01:35:02,108 --> 01:35:07,563
Ma, I always look handsome.

1021
01:35:10,543 --> 01:35:12,137
That's true.

1022
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:26,087
Siddy, you're 4 years old here..
It was your first day of iscool.

1023
01:35:26,613 --> 01:35:29,623
School Ma, not 'iscool', school.

1024
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,213
That's what I said.. Iscool.

1025
01:35:32,232 --> 01:35:34,364
I have no idea
when you'll stop trying to speak English.

1026
01:35:35,369 --> 01:35:39,905
Why should l?
Maybe if I know English like your friends,

1027
01:35:40,123 --> 01:35:42,668
then we can become friends too.

1028
01:35:48,716 --> 01:35:53,146
Look at this one. You were so fat then!

1029
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:04,829
Ma, you look stunning here!

1030
01:36:08,076 --> 01:36:10,061
These photographs are lovely..
who took them?

1031
01:36:10,606 --> 01:36:12,173
Your Dad did, who else?

1032
01:36:13,342 --> 01:36:15,610
Really? I'm surprised he found the time.

1033
01:36:16,362 --> 01:36:18,782
He always had time to take your pictures.

1034
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,274
As soon as he got back from work,
you two would start.

1035
01:36:23,302 --> 01:36:25,716
He'd take pictures, and you would pose.

1036
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:28,423
I thought you'd become an actor!

1037
01:36:30,126 --> 01:36:34,757
Really Sid, your father has really captured..

1038
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:37,165
..your childhood in these albums.

1039
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:47,720
Ma.. I should go..

1040
01:36:54,452 --> 01:36:58,855
Siddy, I hope you're eating properly..

1041
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:01,955
Yes Ma. We're fine, managing.

1042
01:37:03,828 --> 01:37:05,531
And there's always the mangoes
that you send.

1043
01:37:07,498 --> 01:37:08,594
It was kinda obvious..

1044
01:37:17,008 --> 01:37:17,766
Bye..

1045
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:38,719
I really want take a photograph
for the next issue.

1046
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:43,758
I know I'm just an intern,
but I want to prove that I can do better.

1047
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:52,036
'New Girl in the City'. Nice title.

1048
01:37:55,715 --> 01:37:57,847
You read my articles?! All of them?

1049
01:37:58,018 --> 01:38:01,645
I've decided that you're going to write
an article for the next issue.

1050
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,520
If I like it, we'll make it a regular thing.

1051
01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:06,517
Thank you!

1052
01:38:06,693 --> 01:38:07,855
Your writing is fresh.

1053
01:38:08,228 --> 01:38:09,186
Really.

1054
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:12,622
Thanks! Thank you!

1055
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:17,599
Aisha..
- Yes.

1056
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,338
I'm going to a jazz bar
with a couple of my friends tonight.

1057
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,668
There's going to be a live performance.

1058
01:38:23,804 --> 01:38:25,002
It's going to be a nice evening.

1059
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,006
Would to like to join me?

1060
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,508
Yeah sure.

1061
01:38:59,382 --> 01:39:01,372
What could be better than this, Aisha?

1062
01:39:06,139 --> 01:39:07,986
You haven't heard much jazz, have you?

1063
01:39:08,958 --> 01:39:10,821
No.. not really..

1064
01:39:11,247 --> 01:39:12,791
What kind of music do you like?

1065
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:19,193
Umm, I don't know.. Old Hindi Film songs.

1066
01:39:20,403 --> 01:39:22,767
At least they're easy to sing along to.

1067
01:39:25,442 --> 01:39:28,002
You like Film music because it's easy?

1068
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:30,437
Yeah..

1069
01:39:31,815 --> 01:39:32,873
Interesting.

1070
01:39:39,774 --> 01:39:42,020
You know Aisha, there's maturity in your writing..

1071
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,187
But you're still a little childish.

1072
01:39:48,009 --> 01:39:51,394
Anyway, stick around with me
and you'll learn what real music is.

1073
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:07,614
Aisha! Hi!

1074
01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:11,217
Tanya? Hi. What are you doing here?

1075
01:40:11,477 --> 01:40:13,448
I came to drop off some books.

1076
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,892
Thought Sid might need them
for his new assignment.

1077
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:16,121
He's so excited!

1078
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:17,553
What new assignment?

1079
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:18,688
You don't know?

1080
01:40:19,398 --> 01:40:22,061
Amit asked him to take a few photographs
for the next issue.

1081
01:40:22,401 --> 01:40:23,459
Isn't that cool?

1082
01:40:24,003 --> 01:40:25,061
Yeah, it's cool.

1083
01:40:25,104 --> 01:40:26,696
Anyhow, gotta run now. Bye!

1084
01:40:26,873 --> 01:40:27,831
Bye.

1085
01:40:29,275 --> 01:40:31,843
Oh!By the way Aisha,
your place is so cute!

1086
01:40:34,013 --> 01:40:35,171
Thanks.

1087
01:40:56,303 --> 01:41:00,164
I'm starving. I think I'll cook something..
want some?

1088
01:41:00,841 --> 01:41:03,332
I ate already. I made some pasta.

1089
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,238
There's some in the fridge for you.

1090
01:41:06,344 --> 01:41:08,380
Oh God
I hope you cleaned up the kitchen!

1091
01:41:08,749 --> 01:41:11,140
You always make such a mess
when you cook..

1092
01:41:17,909 --> 01:41:19,650
You know,
I'm actually not that hungry.

1093
01:41:21,079 --> 01:41:23,565
I should change though.. it's so hot.

1094
01:41:26,168 --> 01:41:28,058
I haven't done laundry in days..

1095
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:29,396
I don't know what I'm going to wear.

1096
01:41:30,105 --> 01:41:33,664
Aish,I washed your clothes along with mine.

1097
01:41:33,943 --> 01:41:34,808
They're in your cupboard.

1098
01:41:41,484 --> 01:41:43,978
Sid! You should have asked me
before washing my clothes!

1099
01:41:44,103 --> 01:41:46,788
I sleep in this white kurta
and I never wash it!

1100
01:41:46,825 --> 01:41:50,248
Washing ruins it and besides..
I like it being dirty!

1101
01:41:51,394 --> 01:41:52,693
Aisha what's wrong with you?

1102
01:41:53,596 --> 01:41:56,456
Instead of thanking me for washing
your clothes, you're yelling at me?!

1103
01:41:56,599 --> 01:42:00,000
Because I want to wash my own damn clothes
and cook my own damn food!

1104
01:42:00,303 --> 01:42:02,094
This doesn't even feel like
my house anymore!

1105
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:04,702
I don't like it when you do my work or..

1106
01:42:04,821 --> 01:42:07,373
..when you call office girls into my house!

1107
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:13,140
You have lost your mind!
I think the heat has gotten to your head!

1108
01:42:13,217 --> 01:42:15,310
Of course it has!

1109
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,851
So what can I do?
Make the heavens rain for you?

1110
01:42:17,972 --> 01:42:20,063
Why not?-Now that you're so efficient
at everything..

1111
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:21,150
Iets see you do this too!

1112
01:42:21,305 --> 01:42:22,915
Here's your rain!

1113
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,121
I can't believe you just did that!

1114
01:42:28,299 --> 01:42:30,265
Aisha you'll ruin my iPod!!

1115
01:42:52,256 --> 01:42:53,852
Aish.. are you Ok?

1116
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:57,354
I'm sorry, I was just kidding..

1117
01:43:23,924 --> 01:43:24,982
You sure you're Ok?

1118
01:43:25,525 --> 01:43:26,787
Yeah.

1119
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:28,452
Ok then!

1120
01:43:29,396 --> 01:43:32,991
Enough Sid! Don't behave like a kid.

1121
01:44:07,869 --> 01:44:13,295
Sid.. if you keep helping me like this,
I'll get used to it.

1122
01:44:14,009 --> 01:44:14,967
So?

1123
01:44:16,312 --> 01:44:19,670
So it's not right.
What will I do when you're gone?

1124
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:22,308
I'm not going anywhere.

1125
01:44:25,922 --> 01:44:27,649
Come now. The food's getting cold..

1126
01:46:58,547 --> 01:46:59,275
What's up?

1127
01:47:01,183 --> 01:47:04,069
Sid.. I' m really worried about my article..

1128
01:47:06,055 --> 01:47:08,020
Why? I'm sure it'll be great.

1129
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:10,449
How do you know?

1130
01:47:11,427 --> 01:47:12,789
I just know.

1131
01:47:48,756 --> 01:47:52,058
Nice. Just proofread it once
before you submit it.

1132
01:47:52,247 --> 01:47:53,900
Ok. Can I take off now?

1133
01:47:54,172 --> 01:47:59,436
One second, Aisha.
I have two tickets for a jazz concert tonight.

1134
01:47:59,511 --> 01:48:01,273
And you're coming with me.

1135
01:48:09,388 --> 01:48:11,979
No Kabir. I can't come.

1136
01:48:14,993 --> 01:48:20,695
You know, I thought if I spent time with you,
I'd start enjoying jazz..

1137
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:25,935
But actually, I just don't like jazz.

1138
01:48:26,789 --> 01:48:28,206
I'm sorry but it's just not me.

1139
01:48:32,412 --> 01:48:33,638
So.. I'll see you at work tomorrow?

1140
01:48:44,995 --> 01:48:49,519
Sid! I've selected one of your photographs
for the next issue.

1141
01:48:50,631 --> 01:48:52,396
Thanks..
- Thank me later.

1142
01:48:52,656 --> 01:48:53,590
Just get drunk for now.

1143
01:48:55,302 --> 01:48:56,799
Have fun! You're doing well.

1144
01:49:22,397 --> 01:49:25,755
Ladies and gentlemen!
I'm Sidharth Mehra from Mumbai Beat.

1145
01:49:28,603 --> 01:49:32,139
On the drums we have Laxmi..
and this is my friend Rishi.

1146
01:49:32,207 --> 01:49:33,304
Thank you, thank you.

1147
01:49:33,909 --> 01:49:36,405
And this is our favorite song. Hit it!

1148
01:49:36,579 --> 01:49:39,175
Dude, not me not me!

1149
01:49:47,423 --> 01:49:49,291
Sid's crazy, isn't he?

1150
01:49:49,692 --> 01:49:51,159
Oh he was much crazier before!

1151
01:49:51,861 --> 01:49:53,995
You can't even imagine the things
we've done!

1152
01:49:59,903 --> 01:50:01,498
And now?
- Now?

1153
01:50:01,805 --> 01:50:03,333
Now he doesn't have time for us!

1154
01:50:04,508 --> 01:50:09,707
New job.. new friends.. you know?

1155
01:50:24,495 --> 01:50:25,955
Doesn't that make you feel bad?

1156
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:33,034
Are you kidding? Of course it does.
But it's Ok.

1157
01:50:33,998 --> 01:50:38,962
Sid might have changed a lot..
but it's all for the better.

1158
01:50:56,428 --> 01:51:00,856
Sid,you're really drunk.
You should go to bed.

1159
01:51:10,243 --> 01:51:11,201
Sid?

1160
01:51:17,283 --> 01:51:18,541
Are you Ok?

1161
01:53:21,965 --> 01:53:23,804
I know we're not talking to each other..

1162
01:53:25,347 --> 01:53:26,816
And that you're still angry.

1163
01:53:28,787 --> 01:53:34,223
But I thought that you would call one day
and ask me to come back home.

1164
01:53:36,495 --> 01:53:37,753
But.. you never did.

1165
01:53:40,219 --> 01:53:45,938
So I decided that I wouldn't come see you
until you called first.

1166
01:53:50,143 --> 01:53:50,991
But today..

1167
01:54:04,057 --> 01:54:09,422
I got a job, Pa..
As an assistant photographer for a magazine.

1168
01:54:12,633 --> 01:54:14,223
And I want to do this job!

1169
01:54:15,369 --> 01:54:19,362
I've been working really hard this past month
and I'm actually happy!

1170
01:54:21,075 --> 01:54:24,476
I know I never mentioned photography
as a career..

1171
01:54:24,862 --> 01:54:26,479
And that we have a family business
to take care of..

1172
01:54:28,065 --> 01:54:30,515
but I feel like you'll understand.

1173
01:54:32,253 --> 01:54:34,614
Because photography is something
I got from you.

1174
01:54:39,127 --> 01:54:41,180
I'd forgotten that photography
was your passion too.

1175
01:54:42,497 --> 01:54:49,294
You used to take so many pictures..
why did you stop?

1176
01:54:55,911 --> 01:54:57,269
You grew up, son.

1177
01:54:59,131 --> 01:55:01,811
You didn't have time
for my photographs anymore.

1178
01:55:03,519 --> 01:55:05,544
And photography had meant
nothing more to me..

1179
01:55:06,722 --> 01:55:08,556
..than taking pictures of you.

1180
01:55:24,708 --> 01:55:28,276
My first paycheque, Pa. For you.

1181
01:55:38,502 --> 01:55:41,351
Promise me.. that from now on you..

1182
01:55:42,304 --> 01:55:43,652
..will put your heart into everything you do.

1183
01:55:48,533 --> 01:55:49,691
I'm sorry, Pa.

1184
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:53,628
I love you.

1185
01:56:34,664 --> 01:56:37,080
What's going on, Sid?
Why did you ask me to rush home?

1186
01:56:42,589 --> 01:56:46,923
Thank God you're home!
You won't believe what happened today.

1187
01:56:47,544 --> 01:56:48,452
What?

1188
01:56:48,962 --> 01:56:50,224
I went to see Dad today.

1189
01:56:51,298 --> 01:56:52,356
Everything is fine now.

1190
01:56:54,401 --> 01:56:56,032
He asked me to come back home.

1191
01:56:57,004 --> 01:56:59,939
I'm going home, Aisha!
Finally back to my own house

1192
01:57:04,545 --> 01:57:06,877
Aish.. say something.

1193
01:57:08,883 --> 01:57:12,903
That's great, Sid.. that's really great..

1194
01:57:16,144 --> 01:57:17,182
When are you leaving?

1195
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:21,054
Now. Dad's on his way to pick me up.

1196
01:57:24,099 --> 01:57:25,323
You're leaving so soon..?

1197
01:57:29,635 --> 01:57:32,502
Now this garbage dump
will look like a house again.

1198
01:57:40,015 --> 01:57:44,475
Aisha.. you let me stay here for so long..

1199
01:57:45,561 --> 01:57:47,252
Thank you so much for everything.

1200
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:52,184
This is for you.

1201
01:57:56,783 --> 01:57:58,191
I don't want it.

1202
01:58:00,370 --> 01:58:04,656
Aisha, I know it's not much,
but I made it especially for you.

1203
01:58:04,941 --> 01:58:07,141
I don't want your stupid gift, Ok?

1204
01:58:08,705 --> 01:58:10,036
What are you getting so upset for?

1205
01:58:10,531 --> 01:58:12,793
You're so right.
Why am I getting upset?

1206
01:58:13,317 --> 01:58:14,978
After all, I knew this would happen.

1207
01:58:15,252 --> 01:58:16,849
You fought with your parents,
so you moved in.

1208
01:58:16,901 --> 01:58:18,582
Now that you've made up with them,
you're moving out!

1209
01:58:19,123 --> 01:58:21,685
So? I'm moving back to my house.

1210
01:58:22,009 --> 01:58:23,026
I can't stay here forever, can l?

1211
01:58:23,204 --> 01:58:24,488
Why can't you?

1212
01:58:25,496 --> 01:58:26,522
Aisha.. I don't understand..

1213
01:58:26,597 --> 01:58:29,091
Of course you don't!
You never understand anything!

1214
01:58:29,667 --> 01:58:32,707
You didn't even talk to me before taking
such a big decision!

1215
01:58:33,671 --> 01:58:35,905
Didn't even stop to think about
how I might feel!

1216
01:58:36,798 --> 01:58:39,538
How can you be
so thoughtless and immature?!

1217
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:42,405
I should've known.
You're a kid and always will be a kid!

1218
01:58:42,481 --> 01:58:46,911
Damn you Aisha!
Why do you always do this?

1219
01:58:48,187 --> 01:58:50,222
Nothing I do is ever good enough for you!

1220
01:58:51,123 --> 01:58:53,115
Yes, I'm a kid and always will be a kid!

1221
01:58:53,625 --> 01:58:57,753
God, l' m tired of this..
tired of you calling me immature..

1222
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,022
Tired of proving myself to you!

1223
01:59:01,267 --> 01:59:04,930
All these days, I've been trying
to change your opinion of me..

1224
01:59:06,504 --> 01:59:09,034
..hoping that you'll see that
I'm not a kid anymore, but it's useless!

1225
01:59:09,442 --> 01:59:10,968
You just don't see it!

1226
01:59:11,244 --> 01:59:13,403
I'm sick of you Aisha!
I'm just so sick of you!

1227
01:59:32,766 --> 01:59:33,724
Aish..

1228
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:41,307
You're right Sid.
I'm the one who doesn't see it.

1229
01:59:45,947 --> 01:59:50,108
Go home. All the best.

1230
02:01:54,047 --> 02:01:57,378
Hello Ma.. It's me, Aisha.

1231
02:02:01,087 --> 02:02:05,624
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I was just missing you guys..

1232
02:02:06,927 --> 02:02:07,885
Where's Dad?

1233
02:03:21,705 --> 02:03:26,599
Bhaiyya! Wake up Bhaiyya!

1234
02:03:37,655 --> 02:03:41,623
Bhaiyya? Are you Ok?

1235
02:03:42,793 --> 02:03:44,192
Aren't you happy to be back home?

1236
02:03:48,099 --> 02:03:52,830
I'm fine, Chhotu. Now go, don't bug me.

1237
02:03:53,705 --> 02:03:56,502
Make sure you eat your breakfast
before it gets cold.

1238
02:03:56,675 --> 02:03:59,737
And your magazine came this morning..

1239
02:06:29,267 --> 02:06:34,671
Like many others before me,
I came to Mumbai with many dreams.

1240
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:38,157
The biggest one was to become a writer.

1241
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:43,041
With this column, Mumbai has made
that one dream come true.

1242
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:47,609
But, even after a lot of struggle,
I couldn't do it justice.

1243
02:06:48,236 --> 02:06:50,711
Everything I wrote seemed lacking.

1244
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:54,418
What could I say about this city
that hadn't been said before?

1245
02:06:55,614 --> 02:07:00,588
So I tore up my approved article
and began writing again.

1246
02:07:05,608 --> 02:07:06,796
In just two months..

1247
02:07:07,073 --> 02:07:10,871
I've begun to feel a strange love for Mumbai,
as if its my own..

1248
02:07:11,544 --> 02:07:12,502
What lay at the core of this love?

1249
02:07:13,129 --> 02:07:14,337
My exciting new job?

1250
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:17,679
My little flat? Or my independence?

1251
02:07:18,324 --> 02:07:20,443
What has this city given me
that makes me love her so?

1252
02:07:21,454 --> 02:07:24,108
Actually the answer had been
in front of me all along..

1253
02:07:24,858 --> 02:07:26,200
I just didn't see it.

1254
02:07:28,195 --> 02:07:30,685
I met someone the first night
that I was in Bombay.

1255
02:07:31,031 --> 02:07:35,997
A boy, a friend, a room mate,
a companion - just someone.

1256
02:07:38,053 --> 02:07:40,203
He didn't really have
any ambitions or goals..

1257
02:07:40,604 --> 02:07:43,356
.. but he sure knew how to enjoy his life.

1258
02:07:44,612 --> 02:07:45,670
When I look back..

1259
02:07:45,813 --> 02:07:48,213
I wonder if the joy
of making a new home..

1260
02:07:48,382 --> 02:07:49,873
.. would have been the same
without his help..

1261
02:07:50,284 --> 02:07:55,347
I look back upon a lonely night made
less lonely by a shared cup of tea.

1262
02:07:55,724 --> 02:07:58,454
When I had first come here,
I had my goals straight.

1263
02:07:58,927 --> 02:08:02,820
But now I know, that the joy of achieving
these goals is meaningful

1264
02:08:03,098 --> 02:08:04,890
only when shared with someone else.

1265
02:08:05,717 --> 02:08:08,968
Only now do I see that my strange love.

1266
02:08:09,488 --> 02:08:13,338
for this city is actually one with my love
for this person!

1267
02:08:13,976 --> 02:08:15,637
He's the one who taught me
the essence of love.

1268
02:08:17,112 --> 02:08:19,842
Mumbai is as tough as it is beautiful.

1269
02:08:20,182 --> 02:08:21,946
Sometimes, while running after our goals

1270
02:08:22,018 --> 02:08:24,252
we lose sight of the things
that really matter.

1271
02:08:24,687 --> 02:08:28,785
So close your eyes for a second,

1272
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:31,916
Look for your special someone,
and see the city through their eyes.

1273
02:08:32,095 --> 02:08:35,260
You'll see that Mumbai is even more beautiful
than you ever imagined.

1274
02:08:35,532 --> 02:08:38,990
Who knows, you might even get
a companion like me.

1275
02:09:25,684 --> 02:09:27,183
Why did you write such a long article?!

1276
02:09:27,586 --> 02:09:28,694
Couldn't you have told me
all of this at home?

1277
02:09:30,539 --> 02:09:33,007
You know that I'm an idiot!

1278
02:09:37,713 --> 02:09:44,312
Aish.. I love you too! I love you!

1279
02:09:45,017 --> 02:09:46,486
I love you, Sid!
