 That pillar marks the LOC

143
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,743
 That's amazing

00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,579

00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,420

156
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,133
 ...within the framework of
 our composite dialogue

 You were watching our live
 telecast from the Wagah border

 This is a historic day

159
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,317
 Today, lndia and Pakistan
 can hope that these steps...

160
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,987

 that has long divided us

161

00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,762
 l haven't thought about marriage

184
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,763
 So give it a thought now

185
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,102
 Okay, say you'll think of it
 Or is it asking too much?

186
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,774
 No, it's not that

187
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,777
 l'll think about it

188
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,119
 Hi mom

189
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,120
 When did you come?
 - A little while ago

190
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,124
 Dinner?
 - l've eaten

191
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,963
 What're you reading?

192
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,964
 Have a lecture at 9 tomorrow,
 Just making some notes

193
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,142
 Rajiv asked me to marry him

194
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,150
 What did you say?

195
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,320
 What should l have said?

196
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,157
 l think...whatever it was
 you and Karan shared

197
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,166
 ...it's in the past?

198
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,167
 lt's something like that

199
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,171
 What do you think?

200
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,174
 You can't spend the
 rest of your life in mourning

201
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,514
 That's true but...

202
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,850
 But what?

203
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,853
 Nothing

204
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,864
 Come on! Come on

205
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,037
 Good shot

206
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,210
 Well done Karan! Well done

207
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,211
 Come on! Come on

208
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,552
 Hello sir
 - Hi Karan

209
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,556
 You see that?

210
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,557
 Sir

211
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,558
 The snow is melting
 Summer is here

212
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,566
 How cold does it get
 up there in winter, sir?

213
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,235
 Minus forty degree, minus fifty degrees
 - Really

214
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,236
 Yes, it's difficult to stay up there

215
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,906
 Both, the Pakistanis and
 we vacate our posts in winter

216
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,745
 lt's like a gentleman's pact

217
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,746
 that neither of us will
 take advantage of this

218
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,417
 Once the weather changes,
 we man our posts again

219
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,755
 l'd like to go there, sir

220
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,259
 Someday you'll have to

221
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,435
 Check
 - Check

222
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,436
 Sure you aren't a cousin of our
 Grandmaster Vishwanath Anand?!

223
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,608
 Good morning sir
 - Hey morning

224
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,775
 Coffee?

225
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,110
 Why not?

226
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,111
 Ashok, another cup please?
 - Yes, sir

227
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,954
 From home

228
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,624
 Do you like mangoes?
 - Sir?

229
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,959
 Mangoes?

230
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,462
 l like them

231
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,464
 Ever eaten mangoes from Maliyabad?

232
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,465
 l will if you get them, sir

233
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,968
 The fun lies in eating
 them fresh at the orchard

234
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,972
 Hey, Mishra!

235
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,807
 Want to come home and eat
 mangoes next season?

236
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,644
 You plan this every year
 but never take me there!

237
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,645
 l wonder if he really has
 any orchards at all!

238
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,149
 Come on! lt's your move

239
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,150
 Check!
 - Again?!

240
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,822
 Why don't you...

241
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,165
 Hey Karan...

242
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,166
 lsn't she the girl whose
 picture is in your wallet?

243
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,506
 What happened? A tiff?

244
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,513
 Excuse me sir

245
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,725
 Hey Rajiv
 - Hi brother

246
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,892
 What's up?

247
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,061
 Where you coming from?

248
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:47,062
 There

249
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,070
 Where's Romi?

250
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,071
 She's busy preparing
 for tomorrow's protest march

251
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,576
 Protest match? Again!?

252
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,584
 Okay friends, the pamphlets are here

253
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,587
 Now our volunteers must be at
 every gate by 7 in the morning

254
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,426
 Okay?
 - We'll be there

255
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,595
 Every student should
 be given one, Okay?

256
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,263
 and please ask them to read it

257
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,264
 Pamphlets are meant to be read

258
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,769
 ls this poster okay?

259
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,936
 Good

260
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,105
 Where are the Hindi posters?

261
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,441
 Almost complete Don't worry

262
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,442
 Okay l'm going home
 Call me if you need anything

263
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,447
 Or tomorrowat 7A.M, okay?

264
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,616
 Hi Karan

265
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:39,283
 What's going on?

266
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,452
 Preparation for the march

267
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,453
 Put up posters opposite
 the Vice Chancellor's office...

268
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,458
 ...this very night, okay?

269
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,960
 No more of the Vice
 Chancellor's dictatorship!

270
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,630
 No more! no more!

271
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,798
 Uncle, be honest...

272
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,133
 Are all these rallies and
 demonstrations of any use?

273
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,134
 Everyone has a right
 to speak out in a democracy

274
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,475
 But you shouldn't disrupt
 law and order

275
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,811
 Law and order? Hello aunty!

276
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:08,312
 Hello Karan?
 - How are you?

277
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,480
 l am fine!

278
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,649
 Where's Romi?
 - ln her room, Aunty

279
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,650
 Sit please

280
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,653
 The police resorted to using
 water cannons at the last rally

281
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,324
 Water cannons! She was lucky to
 get away...or else she'd be in jail

282
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,831
 Like mother like daughter!

283
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,832
 l remember being arrested
 in my student years

284
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,836
 Aunty! Under arrest!!

285
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,006
 Akhilesh...
 - Yes?

286
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,842
 l'm going to the
 lndia lnternational Centre

287
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:40,843
 Okay - Bye....bye Karan
 - Bye aunty - Bye

288
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,348
 So tell me, what are your plans?

289
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,021
 l'm going home right now

290
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:53,023
 Then l'm meeting
 my friends this evening...

291
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:56,024
 l don't mean your agenda for today

292
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,362
 l'm talking about life

293
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,698
 Life...!?

294
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,699
 You mean life!

295
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,037
 Right uncle! lt's worth a thought

296
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,208
 You know...

297
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:14,209
 Whatever you do in life,
 it's very important to do it well

298
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,213
 You can become a scientist...

299
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,883
 but what's the use
 if you aren't a good scientist?

300
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,884
 Mow lawns, if that's
 what you want to do

301
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,554
 as long as you do it well

302
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,555
 Do you agree?

303
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,894
 You're right, uncle

304
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,061
 Anyway, l should get going

305
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,563
 Aren't you waiting for Romi?

306
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,564
 No problem! l'll call her later

307
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,740
 Has Karan gone?
 - Yes, he had to leave

308
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,411
 That boy is very confused

309
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,416
 That's his only problem, papa

310
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,919
 He just can't decide
 what he wants to do

311
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
 His life doesn't have...
 what's it called...?

312
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,758
 An objective

313
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,759
 Thats it! Objective!
 He has no real objective

314
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,762
 But wait and watch,
 the day he finds his calling

315
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,933
 ...you'll see how far he goes

316
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,609
 Your juice, sir

317
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:24,446
 Switch on the geyser, will you?

318
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,659
 Do meet them
 they're good people

319
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,495
 You're in Philadelphia
 now and they are too

320
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,497
 Sridhar, breakfast
 - Don't mix them!

321
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,833
 Put the clean ones aside!

322
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,336
 You're mixing them again!!

323
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,671
 You should keep in touch
 with family friends, son

324
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,840
 ls that Udesh? Give me
 the phone, please

325
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,675
 You've know them
 since you were a child

326
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,676
 Just a second, mom!
 lt's important give it to me

327
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,015
 Yes!
 - Mom

328
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,016
 Here! Just speak to Karan first!

329
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:06,521
 Udesh! Can you check if the
 Jurassic Park DVD is available

330
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,363
 Just check! lt must be

331
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,364
 Just courier it to me,
 okay, talk to mom

332
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,370
 Hold on, Udesh...Please
 go speak to your father

333
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,040
 About what?!

334
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,041
 He wants to speak to you

335
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,044
 About what?!!

336
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,881
 Hi dad
 - Hi

337
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,219
 You haven't gone to the office today?

338
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,721
 l usually don't on Sunday's

339
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:40,722
 Oh! ls it Sunday?

340
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,393
 How would you know?

341
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,394
 Sunday, Monday,
 it's all the same to you!

342
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,232
 Are you going to do
 anything in life?

343
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,404
 Of course l will, dad

344
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,405
 But whatever l do, it's very
 important to do it well

345
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:58,909
 l could become a scientist...

346
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,910
 but what's the use if
 l'm not a good scientist?

347
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,914
 Mow lawns, if thats
 what l want to do

348
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:06,915
 as long as l do it well

349
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:10,252
 That's what l feel about life

350
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,591
 That's good

351
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,592
 But just thinking won't help,
 you have to do things

352
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,263
 Udesh isjust two years
 elder to you, look at him!

353
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,088
 Parvesh, tell me something

354
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,093
 Parents, especially fathers...

355
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,931
 Why do they always
 ask the samething?

356
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,932
 What do you want to be?
 What do you want to do?

357
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,103
 lsn't there any other topic?

358
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:02,104
 Who'll ask, if not fathers?

359
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,941
 Mine is reverse!

360
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,942
 l've told my parents l'm doing hotel
 management before they could ask me

361
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,448
 Girls have become
 very sensible today!

362
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,952
 Look at Romi!

363
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,454
 She's been clear about wanting
 to be a journalist all along

364
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,455
 Please, her father's the editor
 of a leading daily

365
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,127
 What problem would
 she have becoming a journalist!?

366
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,795
 What're you saying?

367
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,796
 Whatever Romi decides
 to do, she will do well

368
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,799
 She's really different
 and really smart

369
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,469
 How could l forget who l'm talking to!?

370
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,640
 l'm sorry lover boy

371
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:39,641
 Romi is a genius!

372
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,983
 Guess what, guys?

373
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,984
 l haven't told my parents
 yet but l've decided

374
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,155
 What?
 -Army

375
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,658
 Army?

376
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,163
 You! Join the army! You'll be
 court-martialed the first day!

377
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,167
 Ever woken up before noon?

378
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,837
 l will when l need to!
 Why should l for no reason!

379
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,174
 You want to be an engineer

380
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,176
 Did l ever say you won't make it?

381
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:13,844
 Calm down!
 Why are you over reacting?

382
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,345
 Because you always put me down

383
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,346
 But think about it,
 buddy Army life isn't easy

384
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,854
 Nothing is easy in the world

385
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,855
 But l've decided and
 that's that! l'm joining the army.

386
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,197
 l feel my country needs me!

387
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,198
 Aren't Army uniforms
 smart, Ashu?

388
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,203
 You guys are giving me a complex!

389
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,707
 You're joining the army,
 you engineering...

390
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,878
 you, hotel management

391
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,884
 l'm the only one left!

392
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,885
 Sometimes l think l'll do
 this, sometimes that!

393
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,889
 Why am l likethis?

394
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:14,402
 Why am l likethis?

395
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,088
 Why am l the way l am?

396
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,089
 When did l ever know
 what l am supposed to do?

397
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,094
 Looks like l'll be singing
 this song all my life

398
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,433
 What will happen to me?

399
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,936
 Will someone please tell me?

400
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,605
 Why is it so difficult?

401
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,606
 Will someone help me understand?

402
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,296
 Why am l like this?

403
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,479
 Why am l the way l am?

404
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,169
 Now l feel like doing this,
 but then again it's that

405
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,508
 But why? l just don't know...

406
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,178
 What it is that l must do!

407
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,513
 What now looks clear and simple...

408
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,183
 Tomorrow will seem all twisted

409
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,184
 l feel like my life is...
 - Completely upside down!

410
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,022
 Will l ever change?
 Will l ever believe?

411
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,528
 Will l ever improve?

412
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,031
 l don't know if l will

413
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,700
 What's to become of me now?

414
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,036
 What do you think?

415
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,538
 What's to become of me now?

416
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,539
 Will l just remain the way l am?

417
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,552
 When did l ever know
 what l am supposed to do?

418
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:49,224
 Looks like l'll be singing
 this song all my life

419
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,563
 What will happen to me?

420
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,066
 Will someone please tell me?

421
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,568
 Why is it so difficult?

422
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,569
 Will someone help me understand?

423
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,759
 Why am l likethis?

424
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,676
 lt's just the way l am!

425
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:36,099
 l don't know why
 you are the way you are

426
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,668
 l don't know why
 you are the way you are

427
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,669
 You think about it

428
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,047
 Don't you get bored?

429
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,220
 Where's the time to get bored?

430
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,221
 There's so much going on
 in the world...

431
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,058
 ... if a person is interested,
 how can he get bored!!

432
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,062
 Yeah l know

433
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,401
 You are right

434
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,407
 How come a girl like you
 is into someone like me?

435
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,079
 Why do you love me?

436
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,750
 You want to be praised, is it?

437
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,920
 Seriously...

438
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,590
 l've never seen you
 behave small or petty

439
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,928
 l've never heard
 you talk badly of someone

440
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,099
 l respect that about you

441
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,100
 l like that
 - Really?

442
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,773
 You're a good, big hearted person
 that's why l love you

443
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,781
 Thanks

444
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,124
 Know what l think?

445
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,628
 You're not too bad yourself!

446
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,965
 Shut up Karan

447
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:28,311
 Your juice, sir

448
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:31,312
 Switch on the geyser, will you?
 - Yes

449
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,855
 Hello Aunty! ls Parvesh home?

450
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,625
 What happened?

451
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,626
 Romi, you always
 say that l keep drifting

452
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,864
 That my life lacks a...

453
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:21,865
 An objective

454
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,867
 The world is objective
 - Exactly

455
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,868
 Objective! Now listen...

456
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:30,204
 lt's all clear to me now
 l'm joining the army

457
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,078
 You will join the army!?

458
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,414
 Are you serious?

459
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,415
 Romi, l've decided and that's that!

460
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,819
 l'm joining the army!

461
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,088
 l feel my country needs me

462
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,891
 We all must do something
 for our country

463
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,892
 But when do we ever
 realise our responsibility!

464
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,495
 l have realised it!

465
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,496
 The lMA is in Dehradun
 lndian Military Academy

466
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,033
 l have filled out the form
 There's a written exam first...

467
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:02,272
 lf l pass, there'll be an
 interview and a medical test

468
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,940
 l'm sure to be selected

469
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,775
 By the way, guess
 who's coming with me?

470
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,776
 Parvesh!

471
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:11,881
 l'm really stressed, man!

472
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,417
 Remember we had applied
 to lMA last month?

473
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:15,885
 Yes, so?

474
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:18,886
 l got the letter today, for
 the exam, didn't you get it?

475
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,724
 Maybe, l'll check at home, why?

476
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,462
 l don't want to go!

477
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,996
 Don't want to go!!!

478
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,997
 What are you saying?
 l applied because of you

479
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,201
 l told you, this guy in the army?
 He gets up at noon!

480
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,706
 That's not the point!
 My dad told me...

481
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,641
 lf l do an MBA from any
 American university...

482
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,478
 ...l can get a job the
 very next day in the U.S.

483
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,580
 l can't believe you're off
 to the U.S. now!

484
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,082
 What'll l do alone in the army?

485
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,083
 Man! He's so unreliable!

486
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,940
 Tell me something...

487
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,941
 How many years does
 it take to do an MBA in America?

488
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,687
 What is this?

489
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,657
 What is this?

490
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,658
 Did you apply to the lMA?

491
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,063
 Are you planning to
 sit for the exam?

492
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:34,764
 Actually Parvesh and...

493
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,765
 Did you ask us before
 making this decision?

494
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,669
 Answer me! Did you ask
 me or your mother?

495
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,479
 You've lost your mind!

496
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,480
 Think you can do
 whatever you feel like?

497
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,718
 Not in this house!
 You better understand that!

498
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,954
 But Daddy, what have l...
 - Shut up

499
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,955
 l've had enough!

500
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,227
 Shalini, it's all our fault

501
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,063
 He gets whatever he wants!
 l'm here to earn the money!!

502
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:10,064
 Where's the need for
 him to do anything?

503
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:13,269
 Apart from his regular nonsense

504
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,270
 Now see this...
 he wants to join the army!

505
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,807
 Karan, look at me....

506
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,813
 You will do as l say

507
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,814
 Understand that! You will
 do exactly as l say!

508
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,985
 Enough is enough

509
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,062
 He's very upset

510
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,498
 What's gotten into you!
 Just see how Udesh...

511
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,499
 Please mummy, l am not Udesh!

512
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,078
 Karan, don't feel so bad yeah

513
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,079
 Parents say things they
 shouldn't when they're upset

514
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,049
 But they don't really mean it

515
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,854
 How do l know that?

516
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,855
 l hear what you say...
 and l see what you do

517
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,762
 Do you remember how in school...

518
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,697
 ...both your parents
 would come on Parents Day

519
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,698
 My mom would, but did you
 even once see my Dad?

520
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,039
 You will do as l say!

521
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,241
 ...sorry, but l won't!

522
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,242
 l want to join the army and l will!!

523
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,083
 lf you're serious,
 then don't listen to anybody

524
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,123
 Do what your heart tells you

525
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,525
 But if you're being
 stubborn or egoistic

526
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,961
 because your father
 has said not to

527
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:47,096
 then this would be a wrong decision

528
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:50,097
 No, Romi, it's not about
 being stubborn or egoistic

529
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,202
 l want to join the army

530
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,705
 So! lt's decided then

531
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,440
 Now cheer up

532
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,441
 Come on...come on...

533
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,279
 My God! l never knew you could get
 so angry!

534
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,883
 l am really scared now

535
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,948
 How did it go?

536
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,949
 Romi, l'm sad l can't
 show you my papers

537
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,220
 There's just one fear

538
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,722
 What's that?

539
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,723
 l hope they don't think
 l've copied everything

540
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,926
 ...because every answer
 is just perfect!

541
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:56,197
 Very good

542
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,636
 Now that it's clear
 what my future is...

543
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,043
 other thoughts are
 brewing in my mind

544
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,811
 Like what?

545
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,812
 Like, in a couple of years l'll have to
 get married... So what do you say?

546
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,152
 About what?

547
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,153
 About marriage!

548
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,757
 Karan, l knew that someday
 we'd discuss marriage

549
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,329
 But l never thought you'd
 say it in this manner!

550
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,400
 How should l say it?

551
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,401
 l mean...
 Can't you be more romantic?

552
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,172
 l see

553
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,145
 So you'd like me to...

554
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,081
 ...get you flowers..

555
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,082
 ...gaze into your eyes and say...

556
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,695
 Don't be stupid
 l didn't say that

557
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,365
 But it could've been
 said in a nicer way - Really!

558
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,397
 lf l say that l'm in love with you

559
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,535
 you are my only desire
 what will you say?

560
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,611
 lf l say that l'm in love with you

561
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,516
 you are my only desire
 what will you say?

562
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,424
 l will say...

563
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,425
 that if you had said it
 with a little more panache

564
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,464
 anda little more charm

565
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:11,465
 lt would be nice

566
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,377
 lf l say

567
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,715
 that you are as fresh
 as morning dew

568
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,553
 Your lips as luscious
 as flower petals...

569
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,691
 Your eyes twinkle like fireflies...

570
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,396
 that my heart beats faster
 when l think of you...

571
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:47,101
 lf l say

572
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,274
 lf l say

573
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,275
 that the moon is pale in
 comparison to your beauty

574
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,646
 What will you say?

575
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:05,686
 l will say...

576
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:10,157
 Please don't compare
 me to the moon

577
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:14,862
 it has many blemishes

578
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,834
 And not a flower either
 they wither and wilt

579
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,538
 As for fireflies...they just
 vanish without a trace

580
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,544
 lf you'd stop using cliche's

581
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,545
 and say it in a style
 unique and original

582
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,751
 and with a little more charm

583
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,752
 lt would be nice

584
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,490
 lf l say that l'm in love with you

585
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,696
 you are my only desire
 what will you say?

586
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,571
 lf l say

587
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,975
 you have confused
 me with your answers

588
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:39,713
 How should l say
 what l have to say?

589
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,019
 Nothing l say seems to please you

590
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,690
 Because l think you
 don't even believe me!

591
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,261
 lf l say

592
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,134
 lf l say

593
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,135
 Why is it that you don't know...
 ... that you already have my love?

594
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,912
 l will say...

595
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:12,913
 My heart does say
 we are meant to be together

596
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,919
 lf we truly feel it
 in both our hearts

597
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,920
 then words don't matter

598
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,525
 Don't worry, Shalini,
 let him go if he wants!

599
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,997
 He'll be back in no time,
 i'm absolutely sure of it

600
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,434
 But l'm really amazed
 that he got selected!

601
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,448
 Gentlemen Cadets...

602
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,449
 I, Adjutant of the l.M.A,
 Lt.Col. Pratap Singh...

603
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,720
 ...welcome you to the academy

604
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,858
 Today, you are
 stepping into a new life

605
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,859
 And I expect, that with
 every passing day...

606
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:11,498
 ...you will prove worthy of
 this great institution

607
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:14,935
 Know that you are here
 because you are special

608
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,775
 The lndian Military Academy
 is a great institution

609
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,778
 that has since 1932, produced
 countless brave, able officers

610
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,686
 ...who's commitment cannot
 be praised in just words

611
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:37,259
 First, our country...

612
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,061
 second, the army...

613
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,897
 then, his unit

614
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,898
 and finally, concern for himself...

615
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,702
 ...that is the trademark of
 an l.M.A trained officer

616
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,306
 Gentlemen cadets you must preserve
 the honor and traditions of lMA

617
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,982
 So, good luck to all of you

618
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:23,003
 Gentlemen, there are three basic
 rules in handling a weapon

619
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,475
 One, a strong grip

620
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,210
 Two, a focussed mind

621
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,211
 Three, precise trigger operation

622
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:34,414
 You will now learn how
 to acquire a strong grip

623
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,121
 Karan shergill
 - Yes, Sergeant

624
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:58,105

00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:01,241
 Charge!

626
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,216
 Attack!

627
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,717
 Stab!

628
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,654
 Draw!

629
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,323
 Hit!

630
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,091
 Cut!

631
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,092
 Charge!!

632
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,234
 Detail, get ready to charge!

633
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:28,235
 Charge

634
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,681
 What's the matter?

635
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,682
 Where's your energy?
 Didn't your mother feed you?

636
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,851
 You need to have fire in the belly!

637
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,224
 Move out of line and
 watch the others

638
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,225
 Come on, movefast

639
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,729
 Next

640
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,730
 Detail, get ready to charge

641
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,949
 Forward! What're you looking at?

642
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,755
 Why're you scared?

643
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,756
 He's getting nervous for
 no reason, it's very easy

644
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,859
 You're next, we'll see

645
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:02,996
 All right, Rakesh my boy!
 l'll wave to you from the top

646
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:16,276
 Very bad !fail !!

647
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,746
 You had to do it in a minute, next!

648
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,784
 Go up, cross and jump,
 all in a minute! - Sir

649
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:31,058
 Make it fast

650
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:32,895
 Sergeant!
 - Yes, sir?

651
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,463
 All well?
 - Under control, sir

652
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:37,464
 Good carry on
 - Yes sir

653
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:17,606
 Gentleman cadet Karan Shergill
 - Yes sir

654
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,175
 You fell because you
 were not concentrating

655
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,176
 Do you think you can get away
 for lack of discipline? - No sir

656
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,415
 You shall be punished!
 - Yes sir

657
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:29,416
 You will crawl in that trench,
 no stopping till l say so!

658
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,420
 Now, go

659
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:38,158
 You guys think it's a joke!

660
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,464
 How do you like
 the taste of mud, eh?

661
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,405
 Don't get up, go again

662
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,509
 Move it! Fast!

663
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,881
 Hands low G.C.!!

664
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:04,286
 lt's not easy becoming
 an officer, is it?

665
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:06,622
 Come on, hurry up!

666
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,623
 Don't get up

667
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:14,127
 Hurry up

668
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:20,167
 Come on

669
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,837
 Hurry up

670
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:27,307
 Come on, move

671
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:31,645
 Don't get up you will
 stay on your knees all day

672
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,883
 ls that understood?
 - Yes sir

673
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,166
 What are you thinking?
 - Nothing much

674
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,005
 Let it go, man!

675
00:57:57,006 --> 00:58:00,006
 lt was just bad luck the
 Company Commander came by

676
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:03,543
 And you did give him
 reason to punish you

677
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:09,616
 Now forget everything
 and get some sleep

678
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,821
 Tomorrow is a fresh start

679
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,822
 Don't give anyone
 a chance to punish you

680
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:19,526
 Okay? See you in the morning
 - Good night

681
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,566
 Karan, Saket said goodnight,
 at least wish him!

682
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,037
 Good night

683
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,631
 Did you get into a fight there?

684
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,632
 No...l just...

685
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,670
 Sit down

686
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,130
 Whatever l have earned, acquired...

687
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,572
 All that l have...
 who do you think it's for?

688
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,946
 When my father came here
 from Lahore in 1947...

689
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,318
 What did he bring with him?

690
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,622
 My entire family stayed
 in one small room

691
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:01,294
 When l grew up, l'd hear of
 the house we had in Lahore...

692
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,436
 ...the status our family had...

693
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,976
 This would pierce
 my heart like an arrow

694
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,650
 l vowed that...

695
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,651
 l would restore the family
 position to what it once was

696
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:31,324
 And l succeeded

697
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:34,894
 But my father didn't live to see this

698
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,700
 Now all l have is my family

699
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,638
 and if you have no respect
 for what l have done

700
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,644
 then all my effort
 has been in vain

701
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,956
 You must help him, son

702
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,957
 Start going to the office
 from tomorrow, okay?

703
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,831
 All right, go

704
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,117
 Didn't l tell you he'll
 be back in no time

705
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,790
 l know him Shalini,
 he's good for nothing

706
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,793
 Let it be now
 At least he's back

707
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,964
 Only you expect anything from him

708
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:45,801
 l fail to understand...

709
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,802
 Why Karan can't be more like Udesh

710
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:12,928
 What's this?

711
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,597
 You arrived yesterday
 but called me today!

712
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:16,832
 Nice hair style

713
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,501
 Anyway, how long are you here for?

714
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:22,502
 l'm not going back
 - What do you mean?

715
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,445
 You ran away, didn't you!?

716
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,686
 For once you had made
 your own decision

717
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,890
 only to be defeated
 in a few days

718
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,061
 Your parents were upset

719
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,397
 But you said ''lt's my life,
 l'll decide what l want''

720
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:55,635
 ls this what you decided?

721
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:59,706
 l can understand
 you're annoyed, but...

722
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,511
 What do you understand, Karan?

723
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:05,512
 Remember, it was here that
 you said...you wanted to marry me

724
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,185
 Perhaps even that decision
 has changed!

725
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,186
 What are you saying, Romi!
 - What should l say!?

726
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:16,222
 When someone can't respect
 himself or his own decision...

727
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,693
 How can l expect him to respect me?

728
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,694
 Please listen to...
 - Don't touch me

729
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,901
 l don't think l ever
 want to meet you again

730
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:31,633
 You accept that you have done wrong

731
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,634
 You accept that you have
 disgraced this institution

732
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:38,640
 Answer, yes or no?
 - Yes sir

733
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,641
 Are you ready for any punishment
 given to you? - Yes sir

734
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:45,745
 Your act was
 not a minor misdemeanor

735
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,917
 You will undergo a
 28 day restriction period

736
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:51,918
 After that, your plea
 will be considered - Yes sir

737
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,922
 Say it loud and clear
 - Yes sir

738
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:12,872
 This is your path...
 You know it now

739
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:23,049
 This is your dream...
 You realise it now

740
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,069
 This is your path...
 You know it now

741
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:53,413
 This is your dream...
 You realise it now

742
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,822
 Now you have to prove it

743
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,633
 Nothing can hinder you or stop you
 You will fulfill your objective

744
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:23,109
 Your objective...
 must be achieved at any cost

745
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,878
 When you walk with your
 heart full of courage

746
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,649
 The ground will tremble
 beneath your feet

747
01:07:05,821 --> 01:07:08,821
 Distances will not matter

748
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,826
 Your goal will step
 forth and embrace you

749
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:18,566
 When you walk with your
 heart full of courage

750
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:21,002
 The ground will tremble
 beneath your feet

751
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:24,003
 Stride forth, day or night
 lt's not for you to rest or stop

752
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:34,347
 You will fulfill your objective

753
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,851
 Your objective...must be
 achieved at any cost

754
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:07,380
 This is your path...
 You know it now

755
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:17,356
 This is your dream...
 You realise it now

756
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,766
 Now you have to prove it

757
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,956
 You are now officers
 of The lndian Army

758
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:04,897
 Congratulations
 -Thanks mom

759
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,967
 Udesh had called
 He said to salute you on his behalf

760
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,539
 Typical Udesh

761
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,844
 Your father did want to be here

762
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:19,714
 But an important meeting
 came up at the last minute

763
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:22,715
 lt's okay, I understand

764
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,652
 My mom
 - Good morning mom

 and go wherever ordered...

776
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,822
 by land...

777
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,323
 sea...

778
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,292
 or air...

779
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,094
 and that...

01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,030
 l will observe & obey...

781
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,299
 all commands...

782
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,334
 of the President...

783
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:16,104

784
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,405
 and...

785
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,607
 the Commands of...

786
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,643
 any officer...

787
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,811
 set over me...

788
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,812
 even to the peril of my life

789
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:11,057
 Welcome once again to
 ''To each his own view''

790
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:14,128
 For those who have just tuned in...

791
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,464
 our topic for today is...

792
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,465
 Today's Woman in the
 eyes of Today's Man

793
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,635
 Mr. Trivedi, you were
 saying before the break

794
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,306
 Yes, first and foremost...

795
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:28,307
 Woman is a mother,
 wife and homemaker

796
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:31,477
 lf you try changing her role

797
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,480
 it will cause an upheaval in her
 life and in society

798
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,654
 lt's okay, it's your belief

799
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,155
 We'll come back to you

800
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,156
 Mr. Rajiv Kohli you are
 a business executive

801
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,828
 Do you agree with him?
 - No, l don't agree with him

802
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,034
 Today in the corporate or creative world
 or any field, for that matter

803
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:00,506
 Women are not only matching
 strides with men...

804
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,510
 but are gradually going ahead

805
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:09,348
 No, don't clap, it's a fact

806
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:13,519
 Today's woman is a success story

807
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:16,522
 A shining example is with us today
 Miss Romila Dutta

808
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:22,094
 Thank you

809
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,068
 Only soft drinks tonight?

810
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:32,140
 How's it going, kids?

811
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,141
 Call for you
 - l'll be back

812
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:44,218
 Hello

813
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,219
 Hi Romi

816
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,971
 By the way...

817
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,972
 l've got a job as a
 correspondent for Global News

818
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,744
 Why wouldn't you?

819
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,248
 When are you coming to Delhi?

820
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,250
 Why?

821
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,251
 We should meet

822
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:29,361
 You can't make
 all the decisions, Romi

823
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:32,765
 You decided that we should not meet

824
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,136
 Now if we should or should
 not meet l will decide

825
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:43,542
 Okay, bye!

826
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,930
 Hey Karan, where are you going?
 - Home

827
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:41,567
 Fansukh!

828
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:17,770
 One's missing, look over there

829
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,006
 Okay Ashok

830
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:27,875
 Thanks for coming to the airport

831
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,876
 The army has polished
 up your manners, l see!

832
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,513
 You wait and watch

833
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,352
 l'll see you this evening
 l must get to work now

834
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,353
 l'm planning to go &
 meet Romi this evening

835
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:48,193
 When did you last speak to her?
 - Why?

836
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,700
 She's getting engaged today

837
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:42,748
 Reports of intrusion are
 coming in from Drass

838
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:45,751
 Intruders have also crossed
 the LOC into Kaksar and Batalik

839
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:50,089
 Regretable thing is that
 after returning from Lahore

840
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,126
 prospects to peace is
 rendered impossible

841
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,761
 Oh my God!

842
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,762
 What's this new problem?

843
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,833
 Hi mom

844
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:06,105
 Where have you been all evening?

845
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:12,513
 Come in

846
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:15,514
 What's this news from Kargil?
 You're posted there, aren't you?

847
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:21,286
 What news? l haven't heard anything

848
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,457
 Really? There was something
 on the T.V about it

849
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,698
 Hello

850
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:37,302
 Just a moment!

851
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:40,305
 lt's for you

852
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,646
 Hello

853
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:48,647
 Sir!
 Lt.Shergill here Sir

854
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,985
 Yes sir

855
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:56,421
 Sir

856
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:59,424
 Right Sir

857
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:03,328
 My leave is cancelled

858
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,367
 But what's happened?
 You just got here!

859
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:09,368
 lt's this news, isn't it?
 What did he say?

860
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,239
 That l should report back at once

861
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,240
 He must have said more!

862
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:17,044
 What are you hiding?

863
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:20,045
 l don't have anything
 to tell you, Dad!?

864
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:23,215
 l've to go

865
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,508
 Due to commencement of Operation Vijay

866
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:53,779
 you are being made an Acting Captain

867
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:19,471
 Army lntelligence has reported that
 our neighbours...have betrayed our trust

868
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,546
 They have crossed the Line
 of Control and infiltrated....

869
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,547
 regionsfrom Batalik to
 Drass with armed intruders

870
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,088
 Our unit is responsiblefor Peak 51 79

871
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:40,425
 l've called for a briefing
 in the next 15 minutes

872
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,768
 Come what may,
 we must recapture Peak 51 79

873
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:55,941
 At any cost!

874
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,340
 This isthe mountain known
 as Peak 51 79 on the map

875
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,948
 We cannot access it's northern side...
 without crossing the LOC

876
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,287
 And we have been given
 precise orders...

877
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:43,288
 that under no circumstances,
 can we cross the LOC So!

878
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:49,127
 That leaves us with three sides

879
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:53,665
 The western side is a sheer cliff
 850 to 900 feet high

880
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:59,304
 The enemy has a natural defense here

881
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:03,742
 That leaves two sides

882
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,580
 This is the southern side, facing us

883
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,751
 But there's open plain
 from here to there

884
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:14,922
 No cover at all

885
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:16,757
 The enemy perched on the mountain...

886
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,758
 can easily watch our
 movements from his bunker upto 3 km

887
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:26,264
 This means that we are left with
 only one option the eastern side

888
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:32,270
 That's right

889
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:35,607
 We will send a small team

890
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:38,112
 They must move undetected and explore

891
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:41,113
 and chart possible routes
 that will provide us...

892
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:47,619
 with maximum cover

893
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:06,473
 There!

894
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,474
 Their bunkers must
 be across that ridge line

895
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:14,379
 That's the only access to this side

896
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:17,549
 They would've definitely covered it

897
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,898
 Hello, Ghaznavi 1

898
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,903
 Hello, Ghaznavi 3, come in, over

899
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,904
 Sir, l can see lndian soldiers
 one and half kmsaway

900
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,241
 A patrolling party, perhaps

901
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,509
 No firing

902
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:45,412
 Don't reveal your position

903
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,413
 Understood, sir, over

904
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:53,952
 Karan, get back!

905
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:02,694
 Why were you in the open?
 - Sorry, sir

906
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,833
 l felt a presence on the mountain

907
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,436
 l felt like l was being watched

908
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:39,466
 Come on, get the camera, quick!

909
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,835
 Come on... come on... hurry up

910
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:44,836
 Hey, isn't that Romila Dutta?

911
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,340
 You're right

912
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:56,150
 Hello
 - Hi!

913
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,151
 How far is that shelling from here?
 -About 3 kms away

914
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:04,256
 The Pakistanis on the mountain...
 ...are trying to cut off the highway

915
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:07,759
 l see
 - Don't worry, they won't succeed

916
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:11,129
 Where are you going? - Kargil
 Actually we are from Global news

917
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,332
 You don't need an introduction!

918
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:15,369
 Hi

919
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:16,737
 Hello

920
01:26:16,738 --> 01:26:18,939
 Hi

921
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,941
 The shelling you hear
 is from the other side

922
01:26:20,942 --> 01:26:23,942
 Our Artillery will see where best
 to retaliate and then fire back

923
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:43,063
 ln mountain warfare...

924
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:46,064
 the side occupying the
 heights holds the advantage

925
01:26:47,569 --> 01:26:50,569
 Therefore! Before any attack on
 the feature's eastern side...

926
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:57,909
 we need to know...

927
01:26:58,146 --> 01:27:01,146
 the exact position of
 the enemy's bunkers

928
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:05,319
 The strength of their fire power

929
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,320
 An aggressive patrol will
 be sent to accomplish this

930
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:12,090
 What's the plan, sir?

931
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:17,729
 Thank you sir

932
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:22,167
 Four teams! The first from this side

933
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:26,338
 You will lead it. Second team, Kaushal
 - Yes sir

934
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,845
 You will apply pressure on to this area

935
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:34,846
 Third team, Satish and Capt. Ramanna

936
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:37,684
 You will go till here

937
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:40,685
 And Akbar, Karan & Sgt. Dharamvir Singh
 You will position your team here

938
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:45,359
 and open fire

939
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,360
 This will not be an actual attack
 but they should feel that it is real

940
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:56,534
 When they return fire...we'll get to know
 their positions and weapons

941
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:03,341
 Yes sir

942
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:27,225
 Engagement ring! - Congratulations
 -Thank you.

943
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:26,653
 Alright! Here we go....

944
01:30:26,654 --> 01:30:29,654
 Ready Pradeep
 - Yes sir

945
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:35,226
 All teams open fire!

946
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:13,765
 Sir, Oscar Tango 3 degrees,
 distance 800 metres

947
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:17,170
 they have a medium machine gun

948
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,171
 Here! NW of team D!

949
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,011
 Sir!

950
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:27,113
 Hello Tiger!
 This is team 2 here

951
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:28,782
 Hello tiger, there's a bunker
 on the Camel's Hump

952
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:31,783
 Bunker on the Camel's Hump?
 Okay Vinodh!

953
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:35,119
 Hello Tiger - Go ahead Koushal
 - A bunker! On the landing!

954
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:41,459
 Bunker on the landing, mark it!

955
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:45,463
 Oscar Tango 23 degrees,
 distance 650 metres

956
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:47,801
 There's a bunker on the ridge

957
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:50,802
 On the ridge! Return to base

958
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:56,307
 All teams return to base...

959
01:31:57,111 --> 01:32:00,111
 Mission accomplished...
 l repeat, Mission accomplished

960
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,353
 They have a medium and light
 machine gun in these bunkers

961
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:11,858
 There are 4 bunkers up there

962
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,859
 And they have an 81 mm
 Mortar at the top of this feature

963
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:19,030
 Sir...
 - Yes, Pritam Singh, go on

964
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,200
 They have two 81 mm mortars
 up there, not one

965
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,203
 lt takes at least 10 seconds
 to reload this weapon...

966
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,908
 but the second round comes
 in well before that...

967
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,380
 He's right

968
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,381
 Now that's experience

969
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,552
 Hello

970
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:41,553
 Sir, we pushed them back
 - You fool!

971
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:45,723
 They came to check out our bunkers
 and weapons...and succeeded!

972
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,561
 Stay prepared and alert
 The real attack isn't too far now! Over!

973
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:54,465
 Understood, sir! Over!

974
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,239
 Yesterday, at one point
 l thought my gun had jammed

975
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:02,240
 and almost picked up a
 stone to chuck at the bunker

976
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,744
 Sir!
 - Relax...relax

977
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,745
 As per the CO's plan,
 we must shift base today

978
01:33:07,815 --> 01:33:10,750
 The new base will be closer
 to the eastern side

979
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:13,420
 At Soopra village

980
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,421
 Right, sir

981
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:25,563
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

982
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:29,767
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

983
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:38,476
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

984
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,680
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

985
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:47,385
 We must keep moving now

986
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,522
 with one single thought
 in all our minds

987
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,160
 We must keep moving now

988
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,198
 with one single thought
 in all our minds

989
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:04,268
 Come what may! We will melt
 stone with our intensity

990
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,640
 Come what may! We will
 overshadow mountains like clouds

991
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,810
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

992
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,981
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

993
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:30,528
 Lets enter the battlefield
 ready to sacrifice our life

994
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:34,832
 Never rest until we have
 reached our destination

995
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,211
 We have the courage to
 laugh in the face of adversities

996
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:51,516
 We have the strength to
 twist the arm of death

997
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,853
 We are a wall of steel
 guarding our borders

998
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,024
 We are alert and ready
 for any enemy

999
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:04,362
 Come what may! We will melt
 stone with our intensity

1000
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,700
 Come what may! We will
 overshadow mountains like clouds

1001
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:13,071
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

1002
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:16,941
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

1003
01:35:54,648 --> 01:35:57,648
 Keep the flame of fervor
 alight in your heart

1004
01:35:58,953 --> 01:36:01,953
 And you shall sing
 the song of victory

1005
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:06,357
 Keep the flame of fervor
 alight in your heart

1006
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:10,461
 And you shall sing
 the song of victory

1007
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:14,832
 The portrait of victory
 we're out to paint

1008
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:19,337
 will be coloured by our blood

1009
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,441
 We all know, in our hearts now...

1010
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,779
 lt's either do or die!

1011
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:36,020
 Even if fire and lightning
 befall our path

1012
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:42,426
 You will not be alone,
 my brothers in arms

1013
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,699
 Whatever be the hardship
 whatever be the strife...

1014
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,970
 Your comrades are with
 you now and forever

1015
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,475
 Come what may! We will melt
 stone with our intensity

1016
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:01,813
 Come what may! We will
 overshadow mountains like clouds

1017
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:06,484
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

1018
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:10,154
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

1019
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:32,376
 l often think about the one l love
 Her memory torments my heart

1020
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:40,685
 l often wonder,
 that letters from home...

1021
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:45,022
 seem to be written on
 paper, moist with tears

1022
01:37:46,026 --> 01:37:49,026
 Memories are like shadows,
 always with us

1023
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:53,931
 Dreams are like friends,
 travelling with us

1024
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:58,202
 No dream will be shattered
 No promise will be broken

1025
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:02,406
 Maythe one you truly love
 be yours when this is done

1026
01:38:03,444 --> 01:38:06,444
 Come what may! We will melt
 stone with our intensity

1027
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,548
 Come what may! We will
 overshadow mountains like clouds

1028
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:14,819
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

1029
01:38:15,789 --> 01:38:18,789
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

1030
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:23,227
 The valley sare echoing
 the song of our caravan

1031
01:38:28,102 --> 01:38:31,102
 The earth and the
 sky are resonating

1032
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:35,408
 The wind and time are resonating

1033
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:38,409
 Every path, every mountain,
 every plain, echoes and says

1034
01:38:41,849 --> 01:38:44,849
 We shall win, yes we
 shall win, every battle!

1035
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:49,253
 Shoulder to shoulder,
 stride for stride...

1036
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:53,090
 when we move forward,
 the enemy quakes with fear

1037
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:24,457
 Rolling...

1038
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,960
 We are at the army hospital

1039
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:29,961
 Today, the Srinagar-Leh highway
 and Kargil...

1040
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:33,798
 have faced heavy shelling
 from across the LOC

1041
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:36,369
 Many villages and houses
 have been hit by shells

1042
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:39,238
 The number of casualties
 is yet unknown...

1043
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:42,239
 but many wounded have been
 brought to this hospital

1044
01:39:43,377 --> 01:39:46,377
 Villages near the
 LOC are being evacuated

1045
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:51,015
 Alwyn, come on

1046
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:03,796
 l know him!

1047
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:05,565
 Please move out of the way!

1048
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:07,266
 Doctor, ls he alive?

1049
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:10,267
 Cool down, please

1050
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:21,712
 Rakesh
 - Karan, longtime

1051
01:40:21,915 --> 01:40:23,416
 Longtime

1052
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:26,052
 Whereare you posted?
 - Drass

1053
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:27,320
 What brings you here?

1054
01:40:27,321 --> 01:40:30,321
 Bad news! Abeer Saxena died today

1055
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,960
 Abeer? How?

1056
01:40:38,098 --> 01:40:41,098
 Shell hit his truck

1057
01:40:43,937 --> 01:40:46,039
 What's going on, man!?

1058
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,474
 Muskoh, Drass, Kaksar, Batalik

1059
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:50,643
 Same story everywhere

1060
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:53,644
 l don't understand Why do wars happen?

1061
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:56,182
 What are so many people dying for?

1062
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:57,650
 When will we understand...

1063
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:00,651
 that war can't solve issues!
 Only peace can

1064
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:04,722
 Just shut up

1065
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:08,059
 Go give this lecture
 somewhere else! Just go out

1066
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:10,496
 l think you misunderstood us...

1067
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:13,497
 You want peace?
 We want it too

1068
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:17,234
 What should we do?
 Stand by with folded hands...

1069
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:20,938
 ...and gift them our
 country on a platter?

1070
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:24,911
 Peace!

1071
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,912
 Capt. Abeer Saxena also wanted peace

1072
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:32,316
 He didn't go attack another country

1073
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:35,655
 lt was his country that was attacked!

1074
01:41:35,656 --> 01:41:38,656
 The road that he lay dying on...
 is a part of lndia!

1075
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:45,763
 First, go have a look
 at his dead body!

1076
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:49,368
 Then give these lectures!

1077
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:52,369
 Go! Look at him!

1078
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:10,121
 l'm okay

1079
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:18,963
 His dearest friend died today

1080
01:42:20,434 --> 01:42:23,434
 l met Capt. Abeer Saxena once

1081
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:35,546
 Excuse me

1082
01:42:53,433 --> 01:42:55,434
 Any problem

1083
01:42:55,435 --> 01:42:58,435
 Our driver has gone somewhere
 with the car

1084
01:43:01,441 --> 01:43:04,441
 Do you need a ride?

1085
01:43:24,631 --> 01:43:26,632
 Thank you! -Thank you
 - Good night

1086
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:29,633
 Go head Alwin, l'm coming

1087
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:35,306
 Do you remember saying, us meeting
 again would be...your decision

1088
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,981
 Yes

1089
01:43:41,982 --> 01:43:44,817
 So should l assume that
 you have decided?

1090
01:43:44,818 --> 01:43:47,818
 l don't know

1091
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:53,657
 Thanks for the lift
 - You're welcome

1092
01:43:59,499 --> 01:44:02,499
 l should have said this before

1093
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:05,836
 Congratulations, for your engagement
 - Good night

1094
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:41,705
 Are you crazy....
 You're going to Kargil!?

1095
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:45,876
 My boss also said the same thing
 - He was right

1096
01:44:45,879 --> 01:44:48,714
 Why go some place involved
 in a full fledged war?

1097
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:51,715
 Why take needless risks?
 -There's no risk

1098
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:55,721
 And even if there is,
 it's not needless

1099
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:58,722
 Any way... - You should have spoken
 to me first - Why?

1100
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:03,394
 Why! You are my fiancee!

1101
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:07,731
 So?

1102
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:13,904
 See, it's better we get a few things
 clear right now

1103
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:18,577
 lf we want to be together,
 this attitude won't do

1104
01:45:18,578 --> 01:45:21,080
 You'll have to make some changes

1105
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:23,249
 Change what?

1106
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:25,584
 What's so difficult to understand!?

1107
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:28,585
 We'll be married soon
 People marry to settle down

1108
01:45:29,256 --> 01:45:32,256
 That won't happen if you keep
 heading off to war fronts

1109
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:36,762
 You're Vice President Sales
 of your company

1110
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:39,432
 You travel to New York,
 London every other month

1111
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:41,600
 Will you stop going
 after marriage?

1112
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:44,601
 That's myjob!
 - And this is my job

1113
01:45:44,604 --> 01:45:46,939
 To be honest, it's more than a job

1114
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,940
 The mountains that have been occupied
 are a part of lndia

1115
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:51,277
 and l am an lndian

1116
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:54,278
 Come on, give me a break
 l'm an lndian too

1117
01:45:54,781 --> 01:45:57,781
 l haven't lost touch with
 my culture and values

1118
01:45:58,618 --> 01:46:01,287
 And l'm upset with you because

1119
01:46:01,288 --> 01:46:04,288
 those values are still
 alive in me

1120
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:07,291
 l see and what does it say?

1121
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:10,461
 That l must dance to your tune
 if we want to be together, right?

1122
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:14,298
 l didn't say that
 - But that's what you meant!

1123
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:18,471
 Remember when we
 met on that TV show?

1124
01:46:18,472 --> 01:46:20,139
 The things you had said

1125
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,140
 Life is not a TV show!

1126
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:27,978
 You will not go to Kargil!

1127
01:46:35,822 --> 01:46:37,990
 Rajiv, l can't thank you enough...

1128
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:40,991
 ... for telling me how you truly feel

1129
01:46:49,336 --> 01:46:52,336
 Your ring

1130
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:20,030
 At sunset tomorrow at 20.00 hrs,

1131
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,535
 we will launch our first attack

1132
01:47:22,536 --> 01:47:24,870
 This is their false front

1133
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:27,871
 We have to destroy all their
 bunkers here...

1134
01:47:29,376 --> 01:47:32,376
 and convert their false front
 into our firm base

1135
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:37,047
 Attacks on the upper ridges
 will be launched from there

1136
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:47,891
 Everyone must be clear about
 the Operation

1137
01:47:48,228 --> 01:47:51,228
 and the part they have to
 play in it!

1138
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:09,079
 Artillery will start shelling the
 feature at 1600 hours, sir

1139
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:13,085
 Good!

1140
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:16,086
 4 hrs of pounding should soften
 the target

1141
01:48:36,943 --> 01:48:39,943
 Behind me here, our artillery is
 bombarding Peak 51 79..with Bofors guns

1142
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:45,951
 The shelling has been on
 for the past 1 hour

1143
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:48,952
 The lndian army seems to be
 getting ready to attack

1144
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:53,123
 Romela Datta, Global news

1145
01:49:16,816 --> 01:49:19,816
 Fire!

1146
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:46,111
 Alpha company... This isTiger...

1147
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:49,112
 Alpha company here...
 come-in Tiger

1148
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:52,516
 All teams, the time has come!

1149
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:56,853
 l repeat, the time has come!

1150
01:49:57,190 --> 01:50:00,190
 Okay sir

1151
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,400
 Take cover!

1152
01:51:16,269 --> 01:51:19,269
 Come on, fast

1153
01:52:35,014 --> 01:52:36,682
 We will advance to the
 trench up there

1154
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:39,683
 Tarsem Singh, cover us
 - Yes, sir! Let's go

1155
01:53:11,551 --> 01:53:13,385
 Take him to the medic's tent!
 - Yes, sir

1156
01:53:13,386 --> 01:53:16,386
 You'll be all right, sir

1157
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:20,390
 Carefully

1158
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:26,732
 Move forward!

1159
01:53:26,733 --> 01:53:29,733
 Glory be to our true guru! (War cry)

1160
01:53:37,410 --> 01:53:40,410
 Get out of here!

1161
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,800
 Sengupta to Kaushal

1162
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,470
 Kaushal here

1163
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:40,806
 Fire on Bunker 4 with the LMG

1164
01:54:40,807 --> 01:54:43,807
 Okay, we'll fire on
 Bunker 4 with the LMG

1165
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:47,644
 LMG group,
 engage the enemy in Bunker 4

1166
01:54:48,481 --> 01:54:51,481
 Fire!

1167
01:55:00,827 --> 01:55:03,827
 Charge!

1168
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:40,864
 Captain!

1169
01:55:41,034 --> 01:55:44,034
 Hello, Ghaznavi 3
 Why has the firing stopped?

1170
01:55:46,539 --> 01:55:49,539
 Ghaznavi 3, come in
 Why has the firing stopped?

1171
01:55:50,543 --> 01:55:53,543
 The firing has stopped because
 Ghaznavi is dead!

1172
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:57,380
 Leave now...or l swear by Allah,
 we won't spare you!

1173
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:01,051
 Swear by Allah!? Are you Muslim?

1174
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:07,891
 For you l'm lndian!

1175
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:33,251
 Great job!

1176
01:56:33,252 --> 01:56:36,252
 Kaushal, Sudeesh, well done
 -Thank you sir

1177
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:42,592
 Sir, have a look at this!

1178
01:56:43,262 --> 01:56:45,931
 They aren't terrorists

1179
01:56:45,932 --> 01:56:48,767
 but soldiers and officers
 of the Pakistani Army

1180
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:51,269
 See these identity cards

1181
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:54,270
 They're from the Pakistani
 Northern Light lnfantry

1182
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:57,440
 We found a ration card
 and some letters

1183
01:56:58,945 --> 01:57:00,946
 That one there is a Captain

1184
01:57:00,947 --> 01:57:03,947
 This identity card was
 in his pocket

1185
01:57:08,788 --> 01:57:11,788
 Keep this

1186
01:57:24,804 --> 01:57:27,804
 Sir, these weapons are
 from the bunkers

1187
01:57:28,975 --> 01:57:31,975
 They had come
 quite well-prepared, sir

1188
01:57:32,645 --> 01:57:35,645
 l see...

1189
01:57:38,985 --> 01:57:41,653
 l see...

1190
01:57:41,654 --> 01:57:44,654
 Show me that

1191
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:48,493
 We found a fair amount of rations, sir

1192
01:57:48,494 --> 01:57:51,494
 I think they had come to stay here, sir

1193
01:57:52,165 --> 01:57:54,666
 There's a saying in my
 marathi...

1194
01:57:54,667 --> 01:57:57,667
 A person who can't manage
 his own house...

1195
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:01,004
 ... shouldn't set out to
 conquer the world!!

1196
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:04,340
 Sir, a photograph with your unit?
 - Why not? Come on boys

1197
01:58:07,013 --> 01:58:10,013
 Ready sir

1198
01:58:10,016 --> 01:58:13,016
 Thank you sir
 - Right?

1199
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:17,020
 Sahib Dharamvir Singh...

1200
01:58:17,023 --> 01:58:20,023
 Organize some soldiers and
 give them a decent burial

1201
01:58:22,695 --> 01:58:25,695
 Okay sir

1202
01:58:28,701 --> 01:58:31,701
 What's the matter?

1203
01:58:34,373 --> 01:58:36,208
 Pradeep?

1204
01:58:36,209 --> 01:58:38,710
 Sir, I think...

1205
01:58:38,711 --> 01:58:41,711
 everyone is reminded of
 the condition...

1206
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:45,548
 ... in which they've returned
 our dead soldiers bodies

1207
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,220
 l see...

1208
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:57,961
 There's a difference between us & them
 & it should stay that way!

1209
01:58:59,565 --> 01:59:01,066
 lmagine what kind of army refuses
 to accept...

1210
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:04,067
 the bodies of their own officers
 and soldiers!

1211
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:07,405
 Should we become like them?

1212
01:59:07,406 --> 01:59:09,574
 This is the lndian Army

1213
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:12,575
 We maintain decency even
 in our enemity

1214
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:18,581
 Sahib Dharamvir Singh!
 Give them a proper burial -Yes, Sir

1215
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:26,089
 Allright gentlemen, we've made it this far,
 but only half the task is complete

1216
01:59:29,428 --> 01:59:32,428
 We have to reach the upper
 ridges of the feature...

1217
01:59:32,765 --> 01:59:35,765
 from where they are targeting
 our highway

1218
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:38,436
 Pradeep! - Sir!
 - Send for another Company,

1219
01:59:38,437 --> 01:59:41,437
 All these officers and soldiers
 will go back to the base

1220
01:59:47,446 --> 01:59:50,446
 Pradeep told me how you
 saved Ramanna's life

1221
01:59:51,784 --> 01:59:54,784
 Well done!

1222
01:59:54,787 --> 01:59:57,787
 Thank you sir

1223
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:12,604
 Rajtilak Singh, you add plenty of
 spice to everything you say!

1224
02:00:12,605 --> 02:00:14,606


1225
02:00:14,607 --> 02:00:16,107
 Sir, he always exaggerates

1226
02:00:16,108 --> 02:00:19,108
 l swear on my mother

1227
02:00:19,445 --> 02:00:21,780
 He narrowly escaped death
 at least 6 times...

1228
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:24,781
 He was behind a rock and as
 he moved, BANG!

1229
02:00:29,121 --> 02:00:30,455
 A shell landed

1230
02:00:30,456 --> 02:00:33,124
 Bullets and shells landing
 all over... Bang!

1231
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:35,460
 All except where he was standing
 -Then?

1232
02:00:35,461 --> 02:00:38,129
 Then he and Kishorilal
 moved forward...

1233
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:41,130
 Kishorilal was hit by a bullet,
 but not him!

1234
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:45,303
 Have you heard about his luck sir?

1235
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:48,304
 l have now
 - You can have my luck, buddy

1236
02:00:48,975 --> 02:00:51,975
 l'll take it right away!
 - Here you go!

1237
02:00:53,813 --> 02:00:55,480
 Raj Tilak
 - Yes, sir

1238
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:57,649
 Didn't your wife just have a baby?

1239
02:00:57,650 --> 02:00:59,818
 Was it a boy or a girl?

1240
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:02,819
 A Girl, sir
 - You're a lucky man

1241
02:01:05,324 --> 02:01:07,492
 You see that, sir?

1242
02:01:07,493 --> 02:01:10,493
 These soldiers were sad yesterday...

1243
02:01:10,496 --> 02:01:13,331
 grieving for their dead comrades

1244
02:01:13,332 --> 02:01:16,332
 But see, how quickly a soldier
 overcomes his grief

1245
02:01:19,839 --> 02:01:22,839
 What else can he do?

1246
02:01:22,842 --> 02:01:25,842
 People tell us that war is bad

1247
02:01:26,846 --> 02:01:29,846
 l ask them who knows this
 more than a soldier?

1248
02:01:31,183 --> 02:01:34,183
 Then why have wars?

1249
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:37,854
 Sir, the one above made
 only one earth

1250
02:01:38,190 --> 02:01:41,190
 But man divided it with iron and gunpowder

1251
02:01:42,528 --> 02:01:45,196
 This became mine, that became yours

1252
02:01:45,197 --> 02:01:47,866
 l'm glad the moon is up in the sky

1253
02:01:47,867 --> 02:01:50,867
 we would have cut it to bits,
 had it been down here

1254
02:01:53,205 --> 02:01:56,205
 That's so true

1255
02:02:01,347 --> 02:02:04,347
 Sir!

1256
02:02:09,555 --> 02:02:11,890
 l went to the Army hospital

1257
02:02:11,891 --> 02:02:14,891
 Ramanna is out of danger
 - Good news sir

1258
02:02:15,061 --> 02:02:17,228
 He's asked me to give you a message

1259
02:02:17,229 --> 02:02:18,563
 What's that, sir?

1260
02:02:18,564 --> 02:02:21,564
 Thank you

1261
02:02:22,735 --> 02:02:25,735
 Sir, the CO said the work
 is only half done

1262
02:02:26,405 --> 02:02:29,405
 lt'll be complete, soon

1263
02:02:30,576 --> 02:02:32,744
 Take this
 - What's this, sir?

1264
02:02:32,745 --> 02:02:35,080
 The area map of our final objective

1265
02:02:35,081 --> 02:02:37,582
 Keep it with you and study it

1266
02:02:37,583 --> 02:02:40,251
 Every path and trail
 of this mountain

1267
02:02:40,252 --> 02:02:43,252
 should be ingrained in your memory
 - Right sir - Go ahead

1268
02:02:53,766 --> 02:02:56,766
 We are here to meet
 Col. Sunil Damle

1269
02:02:56,936 --> 02:02:59,604
 Do you have permission?
 - No we don't but...

1270
02:02:59,605 --> 02:03:00,772
 Sorry you can't go ahead
 without permission

1271
02:03:00,773 --> 02:03:02,440
 Just for 5 min's only...

1272
02:03:02,441 --> 02:03:05,441
 We are from the press,
 this's my card, please understand

1273
02:03:05,444 --> 02:03:08,279
 Chakradhar!
 - Yes, sir

1274
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:11,280
 Let them in

1275
02:03:15,554 --> 02:03:17,021
 Hi

1276
02:03:17,022 --> 02:03:18,857
 What are you doing here?

1277
02:03:18,858 --> 02:03:20,859
 We need to meet Col. Damle

1278
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:23,027
 Some soldiers of this regiment
 are in the hospital...

1279
02:03:23,028 --> 02:03:25,363
 we wanted to interview them

1280
02:03:25,364 --> 02:03:27,198
 He'll be here soon,
 you can wait for him,

1281
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:30,199
 but no cameras without permission

1282
02:03:31,203 --> 02:03:34,203
 Okay, l'll keep it in the car

1283
02:03:39,879 --> 02:03:42,879
 You can sit over there

1284
02:03:48,554 --> 02:03:50,221
 The people of this villagetoo?

1285
02:03:50,222 --> 02:03:53,222
 Yes, shifted to the camps...

1286
02:03:54,727 --> 02:03:57,727
 For a few days

1287
02:03:58,397 --> 02:04:01,397
 l've seen many empty villages
 near the LOC these days

1288
02:04:03,068 --> 02:04:06,068
 How strange villages look without
 their inhabitants

1289
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:11,240
 That'strue

1290
02:04:14,914 --> 02:04:17,248
 You know

1291
02:04:17,249 --> 02:04:20,249
 Often, l've wondered...what must life
 have been like here

1292
02:04:22,588 --> 02:04:25,588
 And now?

1293
02:04:26,425 --> 02:04:28,593
 Look overthere

1294
02:04:28,594 --> 02:04:31,594
 That's the village school,
 the officers stay there now

1295
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:38,601
 There's the mosque...

1296
02:04:39,939 --> 02:04:42,939
 and the village council...

1297
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:47,610
 Not even a trace of how it was

1298
02:04:49,615 --> 02:04:52,615
 You've changed

1299
02:04:58,123 --> 02:04:58,256
 Haven't you?

1300
02:04:58,257 --> 02:05:01,257
 Haven't you?

1301
02:05:17,576 --> 02:05:20,576
 l can remember so many things...

1302
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:26,415
 the images in my mind as
 vivid as photographs

1303
02:05:29,255 --> 02:05:32,255
 How can l forget them?

1304
02:05:35,261 --> 02:05:38,261
 How can l make my heart understand?

1305
02:05:41,433 --> 02:05:44,433
 l have much to tell you....

1306
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:50,439
 but my words
 can't find their way out

1307
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:56,279
 l hope that someday you'll hear me

1308
02:05:59,451 --> 02:06:02,451
 for today,
 you are as lost as I am

1309
02:06:05,457 --> 02:06:08,457
 Why didn't our story have an end?

1310
02:06:11,297 --> 02:06:14,297
 When did this distance
 come between us?

1311
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:58,341
 Questions lie unanswered
 but yet, we are silent

1312
02:07:01,013 --> 02:07:04,013
 l don't know who is to blame?

1313
02:07:10,356 --> 02:07:13,356
 Webs of confusion have
 filled our minds

1314
02:07:16,028 --> 02:07:19,028
 Is anything to be gained
 by our loss?

1315
02:07:21,867 --> 02:07:24,867
 Why do I feel so helpless?

1316
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:34,210
 How did we lose our way?

1317
02:07:37,049 --> 02:07:40,049
 How did this distance
 come between us?

1318
02:07:43,055 --> 02:07:46,055
 I have much to tell you....

1319
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:52,061
 but my words can't
 find their way out

1320
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:58,067
 I hope that someday
 you'll hear me

1321
02:08:01,073 --> 02:08:04,073
 for today, you are as
 lost as I am

1322
02:08:07,079 --> 02:08:10,079
 I can remember so many things...

1323
02:08:13,085 --> 02:08:16,085
 the images in my mind as
 vivid as photographs

1324
02:08:19,091 --> 02:08:22,091
 How can I forget them?

1325
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:27,930
 How can I make my heart understand?

1326
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:27,790
 The moment you've all been
 waiting for...

1327
02:09:28,127 --> 02:09:31,127
 ...has finally arrived

1328
02:09:31,463 --> 02:09:34,463
 Tonight, we will attack
 the upper ridges

1329
02:09:37,636 --> 02:09:40,636
 But remember, it's going
 to be tougher this time

1330
02:09:43,976 --> 02:09:46,976
 First...
 the mountain paths are steeper

1331
02:09:50,482 --> 02:09:52,817
 And second

1332
02:09:52,818 --> 02:09:55,818
 The enemy who has already lost
 half the feature...

1333
02:09:56,822 --> 02:09:59,822
 will be more alert and
 better prepared

1334
02:10:01,160 --> 02:10:03,995
 No problem sir
 - Good

1335
02:10:03,996 --> 02:10:06,996
 We will move at exactly 2300 hours

1336
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,334
 And finally

1337
02:10:10,335 --> 02:10:13,335
 On the highest point of this peak...

1338
02:10:13,672 --> 02:10:16,672
 l want to see our flag fluttering

1339
02:10:18,844 --> 02:10:21,179
 Tomorrow morning!

1340
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:24,180
 It's so inspiring, the way
 our CO speaks

1341
02:10:25,851 --> 02:10:28,851
 Then we must fly the flag exactly
 where he has said

1342
02:10:29,688 --> 02:10:32,688
 I've done half the work

1343
02:10:32,691 --> 02:10:35,691
 Here is the flag...
 Now all l haveto do is hoist it there

1344
02:10:36,695 --> 02:10:39,695
 l hope l'm there to see that happen

1345
02:10:43,035 --> 02:10:46,035
 You will be, trust me

1346
02:10:46,205 --> 02:10:49,205
 Is that so!
 - You'll see!

1347
02:11:06,225 --> 02:11:09,225
 Dear Karan...
 I hope you are okay

1348
02:11:10,062 --> 02:11:13,062
 We miss you and await your return

1349
02:11:15,567 --> 02:11:18,567
 By the way, Romi is there too
 Have you met her?

1350
02:11:20,072 --> 02:11:23,072
 She broke up with Rajiv...
 just a few days after the engagement

1351
02:11:28,247 --> 02:11:31,247
 I don't know what happened
 between you two...

1352
02:11:32,751 --> 02:11:35,751
 but I feel you guys were
 madefor each other

1353
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:39,924
 Now win the war quickly,
 and come home

1354
02:11:39,925 --> 02:11:42,260
 so we can have a rocking party!

1355
02:11:42,261 --> 02:11:45,261
 Your friend, Ashu

1356
02:11:46,932 --> 02:11:49,932
 Karan & Vishal, let's go

1357
02:12:05,284 --> 02:12:07,451
 Dharamvir Singh!!

1358
02:12:07,452 --> 02:12:09,954
 Advance that way
 There's cover ahead

1359
02:12:09,955 --> 02:12:11,122
 Yes, sir!

1360
02:12:11,123 --> 02:12:14,123
 You three, move forward
 We'll cover fire

1361
02:12:26,805 --> 02:12:29,805
 Tiger, come in!

1362
02:12:29,975 --> 02:12:32,975
 There's heavyfire coming
 from the bunker, sir

1363
02:12:33,979 --> 02:12:36,979
 lt's difficult to moveforward

1364
02:12:40,152 --> 02:12:42,987
 Down! Get down!

1365
02:12:42,988 --> 02:12:45,988
 Kirti!

1366
02:12:47,659 --> 02:12:50,659
 Everybody take cover!

1367
02:12:52,831 --> 02:12:55,831
 Take care of him, Manjit come

1368
02:13:01,506 --> 02:13:03,341
 We're getting bogged down!

1369
02:13:03,342 --> 02:13:05,009
 We can't stay here any longer

1370
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:08,010
 There's no cover on this side, sir

1371
02:13:08,013 --> 02:13:09,680
 Raj Tilak!
 - Yes, Sir

1372
02:13:09,681 --> 02:13:11,015
 Take a soldier along!

1373
02:13:11,016 --> 02:13:13,351
 See if there's a way ahead
 past those rocks!

1374
02:13:13,352 --> 02:13:14,185
 All right, sir

1375
02:13:14,186 --> 02:13:17,186
 Sir, l'll go with him
 - Okay, go!

1376
02:13:30,035 --> 02:13:33,035
 Tarsem!

1377
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:35,706
 Get up!

1378
02:13:35,707 --> 02:13:38,707
 Come here, Tarsem

1379
02:13:44,883 --> 02:13:47,883
 Tarsem! Come here

1380
02:13:56,895 --> 02:13:58,396
 Stop the bleeding first! Quick

1381
02:13:58,397 --> 02:14:01,397
 Painkiller, quick!

1382
02:14:10,742 --> 02:14:13,742
 Stretcher! Take him!

1383
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:22,420
 Gopal Singh!
 - Yes, sir

1384
02:14:22,421 --> 02:14:25,421
 lt's pointless to stay here
 We must advance

1385
02:14:25,424 --> 02:14:28,424
 Take the rest of your men...

1386
02:14:50,082 --> 02:14:53,082
 Sir! You okay?

1387
02:14:54,219 --> 02:14:55,820
 Yes, l'm all right

1388
02:14:55,821 --> 02:14:58,622
 Sir, you can't go forward
 in this state

1389
02:14:58,623 --> 02:15:01,623
 Stay here, sir... l'll get them!
 - No, Listen to me!

1390
02:15:02,494 --> 02:15:05,362
 Give me fire cover when l say

1391
02:15:05,363 --> 02:15:08,363
 l'm going to the other
 side of the bunker

1392
02:15:11,703 --> 02:15:14,703
 Now!

1393
02:15:22,647 --> 02:15:25,647
 Sir!

1394
02:16:05,757 --> 02:16:07,324
 Sir!

1395
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:10,027
 l'm all right...l'm...

1396
02:16:10,028 --> 02:16:13,028
 Hang on, sir... Capt.
 Mishra is down there!

1397
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:17,666
 Ghanshyam, take him!

1398
02:16:20,472 --> 02:16:23,472
 Quickly! Be careful!!

1399
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:35,250
 Sir, l'm sending Ganga Singh
 to get help

1400
02:16:35,754 --> 02:16:38,754
 Don't send him alone.
 You both go!

1401
02:16:38,823 --> 02:16:41,823
 But how can we leave you
 in this condition?

1402
02:16:43,562 --> 02:16:45,329
 lf Ganga Singh gets shot
 on the way...

1403
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:47,431
 ... they won't get the message!

1404
02:16:47,432 --> 02:16:50,401
 Sir, why do you want to
 save my life?

1405
02:16:50,402 --> 02:16:51,902
 l will not leave you here!

1406
02:16:51,903 --> 02:16:54,903
 Jogendra!! l may be wounded but
 l'm still your officer!

1407
02:16:56,408 --> 02:16:59,408
 This is an order! Now, go!

1408
02:17:00,245 --> 02:17:03,245
 Hail lndia, sir
 - Hail lndia

1409
02:17:07,085 --> 02:17:10,085
 Ganga Singh!

1410
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:31,440
 Akbar?

1411
02:17:32,611 --> 02:17:35,611
 Akbar!!

1412
02:17:36,481 --> 02:17:39,481
 Just relax.
 Don't worry, you'll be fine!

1413
02:17:43,722 --> 02:17:46,722
 Don't give up, Akbar
 - No...

1414
02:17:46,958 --> 02:17:49,958
 Mishra... the flag...

1415
02:17:50,128 --> 02:17:52,696
 ...up there! lt must be hoisted!

1416
02:17:52,697 --> 02:17:55,697
 You will do it, you will, Akbar!

1417
02:17:57,636 --> 02:18:00,636
 Forceps! l need the forceps...
 quick.

1418
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:05,540
 Hang on Akbar! We've to
 make that trip to Malyabad,

1419
02:18:07,112 --> 02:18:10,112
 To your mango orchards there?

1420
02:18:10,649 --> 02:18:13,649
 Cotton! Now!

1421
02:18:13,652 --> 02:18:15,886
 Don't give up!

1422
02:18:15,887 --> 02:18:18,887
 You had promised we'd go together

1423
02:18:25,297 --> 02:18:28,297
 Don't give up....
 don't...please Akbar

1424
02:19:41,940 --> 02:19:44,908
 Sir!

1425
02:19:44,909 --> 02:19:47,909
 Are you all right?

1426
02:21:00,285 --> 02:21:03,285
 Alijoo, stop the car

1427
02:21:16,734 --> 02:21:19,734
 You okay?

1428
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:25,440
 You always said...

1429
02:21:28,146 --> 02:21:31,146
 ... that my life lacked
 an objective

1430
02:21:32,851 --> 02:21:35,851
 Do you remember?

1431
02:21:37,722 --> 02:21:40,722
 Now l have one

1432
02:21:45,497 --> 02:21:48,497
 That is my objective

1433
02:22:18,997 --> 02:22:20,397
 Sunil

1434
02:22:20,398 --> 02:22:23,398
 l don't doubt your determination
 and courage

1435
02:22:25,103 --> 02:22:28,103
 But you've lost many men of
 your regiment

1436
02:22:30,108 --> 02:22:31,942
 Many are wounded

1437
02:22:31,943 --> 02:22:34,943
 and the remaining troops...
 must be exhausted

1438
02:22:35,914 --> 02:22:38,914
 l think it's wise to give
 the remaining task...

1439
02:22:40,752 --> 02:22:43,752
 to another Regiment

1440
02:22:48,426 --> 02:22:51,426
 We will succeed

1441
02:22:53,865 --> 02:22:56,865
 l don't have time, Col.Damle!!

1442
02:22:57,402 --> 02:23:00,402
 The intruders are shelling the
 highway from Peak 5179

1443
02:23:02,273 --> 02:23:04,942
 Our convoy of trucks
 can't move ahead

1444
02:23:04,943 --> 02:23:07,943
 Arms, ammunition, medical aid
 all supplies...

1445
02:23:09,447 --> 02:23:12,447
 Unless the peak is cleared...

1446
02:23:12,650 --> 02:23:15,650
 the highway is not safefor us

1447
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:19,389
 Do you understand what l'm saying?

1448
02:23:19,390 --> 02:23:22,390
 l need more time, sir

1449
02:23:38,343 --> 02:23:41,343
 l can give you two days

1450
02:23:43,514 --> 02:23:45,983
 48 hours!

1451
02:23:45,984 --> 02:23:48,984
 You'll be given marching
 orders afterthat

1452
02:23:51,956 --> 02:23:54,956
 Gentlemen, this regiment...

1453
02:23:55,026 --> 02:23:58,026
 has always accepted,
 any challenge offered...

1454
02:23:58,763 --> 02:24:01,763
 and has delivered, whatever
 the cost or sacrifice

1455
02:24:05,703 --> 02:24:08,703
 lf we fail to do so today...

1456
02:24:11,376 --> 02:24:14,376
 ... the reputation of this regiment...

1457
02:24:15,046 --> 02:24:16,713
 ... will forever be tarnished

1458
02:24:16,714 --> 02:24:18,949
 We won't let that happen, sir

1459
02:24:18,950 --> 02:24:21,950
 Give us our orders

1460
02:24:25,556 --> 02:24:28,556
 Our regiment

1461
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:31,559
 will remain on the eastern side

1462
02:24:32,063 --> 02:24:34,765
 We will continue
 shelling from here...

1463
02:24:34,766 --> 02:24:37,766
 but the shelling will
 serve as a decoy

1464
02:24:40,505 --> 02:24:42,372
 Meanwhile, you 4 officers...

1465
02:24:42,373 --> 02:24:45,373
 and 8 soldiers who can rock climb...

1466
02:24:45,743 --> 02:24:48,743
 will, far from the enemy's sight...

1467
02:24:50,181 --> 02:24:53,181
 go up the western side
 of the mountain...

1468
02:24:54,519 --> 02:24:56,586
 and launch a surprise attack

1469
02:24:56,587 --> 02:24:58,422
 How high is the cliff, sir?

1470
02:24:58,423 --> 02:24:59,923
 Approximately 800 feet

1471
02:24:59,924 --> 02:25:02,924
 Pradeep, photographs.

1472
02:25:04,595 --> 02:25:07,595
 This side won't be watched

1473
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:11,800
 because it is impossible to climb it

1474
02:25:11,803 --> 02:25:14,803
 But you must make it possible

1475
02:25:21,045 --> 02:25:23,680
 The team leaves at first light

1476
02:25:23,681 --> 02:25:26,681
 Start the preperation!

1477
02:25:38,129 --> 02:25:39,796
 Yes?

1478
02:25:39,797 --> 02:25:42,797
 Sir, I promise you...

1479
02:25:43,568 --> 02:25:46,568
 Either this mission
 will be successful...

1480
02:25:47,138 --> 02:25:50,138
 or I will not return alive

1481
02:25:51,142 --> 02:25:54,142
 I promise you that, sir.

1482
02:25:58,316 --> 02:26:01,316
 Good luck.

1483
02:26:04,489 --> 02:26:07,489
 We have to report at the
 helipad at 0530 hrs

1484
02:26:31,682 --> 02:26:34,682
 Sir, I...

1485
02:26:35,119 --> 02:26:38,119
 Go....go ahead.

1486
02:26:50,535 --> 02:26:53,535
 Hi
 - Hi

1487
02:27:00,444 --> 02:27:03,444
 l miss you

1488
02:27:04,148 --> 02:27:07,083
 l think of you all the time

1489
02:27:07,084 --> 02:27:10,084
 Me too

1490
02:27:11,556 --> 02:27:14,556
 l'm going on a mission tomorrow

1491
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:17,826
 l'll wait for you

1492
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:22,730
 l might not return

1493
02:27:28,105 --> 02:27:31,105
 Then l'll wait, forever

1494
02:29:03,401 --> 02:29:06,401
 Hello
 - Hello daddy

1495
02:29:12,076 --> 02:29:14,311
 Karan?

1496
02:29:14,312 --> 02:29:17,312
 Where are you? How are you?

1497
02:29:17,481 --> 02:29:20,481
 l can't tell you where l am...

1498
02:29:21,919 --> 02:29:23,987
 but l'm okay, dad

1499
02:29:23,988 --> 02:29:26,823
 Thank God for that

1500
02:29:26,824 --> 02:29:29,824
 Your mother's been praying
 day and night...

1501
02:29:31,562 --> 02:29:34,562
 and when you've called,
 she isn't home

1502
02:29:35,499 --> 02:29:38,499
 This call is for you

1503
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:42,170
 To tell you something
 l have never said

1504
02:29:46,477 --> 02:29:49,477
 You have given me
 so much in life...

1505
02:29:54,051 --> 02:29:57,051
 but all l have given you, is grief

1506
02:29:58,322 --> 02:30:00,924
 Why are you saying this, Karan?

1507
02:30:00,925 --> 02:30:03,925
 Please don't think that
 l'm not aware of this

1508
02:30:07,732 --> 02:30:10,732
 But....l love you dad.

1509
02:30:16,941 --> 02:30:19,941
 l love you too.

1510
02:30:21,178 --> 02:30:24,178
 Now, let me tell you something

1511
02:30:26,183 --> 02:30:29,183
 Not one of my business associate
 or a friend...

1512
02:30:31,489 --> 02:30:34,489
 has a son or a brother out there

1513
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:42,630
 These people just talk big!

1514
02:30:45,469 --> 02:30:48,469
 But l can proudly say, my son
 is on the battlefield

1515
02:30:54,745 --> 02:30:57,745
 There was a time
 l was upset with you

1516
02:30:58,215 --> 02:31:00,617
 but today l'm proud of you

1517
02:31:00,618 --> 02:31:03,319
 Very proud

1518
02:31:03,320 --> 02:31:06,320
 Thank you, dad.

1519
02:31:31,215 --> 02:31:33,216
 For when the mission is successful

1520
02:31:33,217 --> 02:31:34,984
 We shall await your signal

1521
02:31:34,985 --> 02:31:37,985
 Right sir

1522
02:31:40,424 --> 02:31:43,424
 Karan, all the best
 -Thank you sir

1523
02:31:47,431 --> 02:31:50,333
 Sgt. Pritam Singh
 - Sir...

1524
02:31:50,334 --> 02:31:52,802
 l know them from experience

1525
02:31:52,803 --> 02:31:54,370
 lf they lose...

1526
02:31:54,371 --> 02:31:56,606
 they will counter-attack immediately

1527
02:31:56,607 --> 02:31:59,607
 Don't drop your guard if you win

1528
02:31:59,877 --> 02:32:01,611
 Remember my words

1529
02:32:01,612 --> 02:32:02,879
 l will

1530
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:05,880
 Hail lndia, sir
 - Hail lndia

1531
02:32:16,127 --> 02:32:19,127
 l have something to give you

1532
02:32:20,131 --> 02:32:23,131
 This is the flag
 Akbar wanted to hoist

1533
02:32:23,701 --> 02:32:25,401
 Take it

1534
02:32:25,402 --> 02:32:27,570
 On his behalf...

1535
02:32:27,571 --> 02:32:29,205
 on my behalf...

1536
02:32:29,206 --> 02:32:32,206
 on behalf of us all,
 you must hoist it!

1537
02:32:34,578 --> 02:32:37,547
 lt will be hoisted, doctor...

1538
02:32:37,548 --> 02:32:40,548
 lt will be!

1539
02:33:32,069 --> 02:33:33,803
 Karan, are you okay?

1540
02:33:33,804 --> 02:33:36,804
 Yes, Vishal?

1541
02:33:44,582 --> 02:33:47,582
 Sir, you have to go back!

1542
02:33:47,885 --> 02:33:50,885
 Don't worry about me, the mission
 must be successful

1543
02:33:51,388 --> 02:33:53,389
 Where is my gun?

1544
02:33:53,390 --> 02:33:56,390
 Give me, my gun

1545
02:33:57,728 --> 02:34:00,630
 Bhagirath and l will cover you

1546
02:34:00,631 --> 02:34:03,631
 Manjit, you lead one team
 Karan, you the other...understood?

1547
02:34:05,336 --> 02:34:08,336
 Yes sir
 - Go boys

1548
02:36:00,617 --> 02:36:03,617
 We are out of contact
 The radio set is destroyed

1549
02:36:05,322 --> 02:36:08,322
 My God!

1550
02:36:12,830 --> 02:36:15,830
 Okay...Raj Tilak
 - Yes sir

1551
02:36:17,301 --> 02:36:20,301
 Move the bodies there
 with due respect

1552
02:36:20,771 --> 02:36:22,739
 Yes sir

1553
02:36:22,740 --> 02:36:25,141
 You will stay here, Babulal

1554
02:36:25,142 --> 02:36:28,142
 Bhagirath is badly wounded
 Take care of him - Yes sir

1555
02:36:29,613 --> 02:36:32,613
 Leave some painkillers and
 first aid with him - Yes sir

1556
02:36:34,718 --> 02:36:36,285
 lf we don't return

1557
02:36:36,286 --> 02:36:39,286
 it may take two or three days...
 for our regiment to locate you

1558
02:36:41,725 --> 02:36:44,725
 Here's some more water

1559
02:36:52,002 --> 02:36:55,002
 Alright, the 6 of us will have to
 finish this job

1560
02:37:01,512 --> 02:37:04,046
 Let's go
 - Wait!

1561
02:37:04,047 --> 02:37:06,482
 Let's not get carried away
 and do something...

1562
02:37:06,483 --> 02:37:08,818
 that will benefit our enemy

1563
02:37:08,819 --> 02:37:10,620
 What do you mean?

1564
02:37:10,621 --> 02:37:12,488
 Think about it

1565
02:37:12,489 --> 02:37:14,023
 We're half our strength now...

1566
02:37:14,024 --> 02:37:16,325
 and don't know, how many
 intruders are up there!?

1567
02:37:16,326 --> 02:37:18,161
 So!? We'll die trying!

1568
02:37:18,162 --> 02:37:20,096
 l'm not afraid of death!

1569
02:37:20,097 --> 02:37:22,732
 But if they realize that
 this side is accessible...

1570
02:37:22,733 --> 02:37:25,733
 We won't get a second chance!

1571
02:37:26,837 --> 02:37:29,837
 All l'm saying is...
 if we attack, we cannot fail!

1572
02:37:32,676 --> 02:37:35,445
 Why would we fail?

1573
02:37:35,446 --> 02:37:38,446
 You don't understand!!

1574
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:39,582
 Listen to me

1575
02:37:39,583 --> 02:37:42,051
 Col. Damle sent 12 men
 for this mission

1576
02:37:42,052 --> 02:37:43,586
 Now we're only 6!

1577
02:37:43,587 --> 02:37:44,987
 We may be 6...

1578
02:37:44,988 --> 02:37:47,690
 but if each of us do the work of two men...

1579
02:37:47,691 --> 02:37:50,691
 we're no less than 12!

1580
02:37:55,365 --> 02:37:57,600
 All right!

1581
02:37:57,601 --> 02:38:00,601
 You can sit here or go back

1582
02:38:00,804 --> 02:38:03,072
 l'm going on ahead!

1583
02:38:03,073 --> 02:38:06,073
 I will go alone.

1584
02:38:13,050 --> 02:38:16,050
 Whatever has to happen,
 will happen!

1585
02:38:52,623 --> 02:38:54,891
 Come on, keep moving

1586
02:38:54,892 --> 02:38:57,892
 We must reach the feature
 in two hours

1587
02:39:05,202 --> 02:39:08,202
 Tiger den calling Barasingha
 Can you hear me? Over

1588
02:39:16,046 --> 02:39:18,614
 No response, sir

1589
02:39:18,615 --> 02:39:20,917
 Keep trying
 - Right sir

1590
02:39:20,918 --> 02:39:23,918
 Barasingha Come in...
 Do you read me?

1591
02:39:58,455 --> 02:40:01,324
 Climb this sheer cliff at night!?

1592
02:40:01,325 --> 02:40:03,526
 It can't be done!

1593
02:40:03,527 --> 02:40:06,162
 It's not possible
 - So, now what?

1594
02:40:06,163 --> 02:40:09,163
 We must climb it now
 - In the day!

1595
02:40:10,734 --> 02:40:13,734
 He's right, look at this map

1596
02:40:17,608 --> 02:40:20,608
 The Pakistani's can't see this
 side from their area

1597
02:40:22,179 --> 02:40:24,046
 As for those up there...

1598
02:40:24,047 --> 02:40:27,047
 we had assumed they aren't
 watching this side

1599
02:40:32,422 --> 02:40:35,422
 There's a ledge, 100feet
 below the ridge

1600
02:40:35,559 --> 02:40:38,559
 We'll climb till there during the day

1601
02:40:38,595 --> 02:40:41,595
 And when our artillery starts
 shelling the peak...

1602
02:40:41,865 --> 02:40:44,865
 from the other side tonight...

1603
02:40:45,869 --> 02:40:48,869
 we will scale the last 100ft

1604
02:40:49,072 --> 02:40:50,973
 The plan sounds fine

1605
02:40:50,974 --> 02:40:53,974
 but it will take time
 to climb so high

1606
02:40:55,212 --> 02:40:58,212
 What if someone just looks down the cliff?

1607
02:40:58,448 --> 02:41:01,448
 That is a possibility

1608
02:41:01,918 --> 02:41:04,854
 But it's a risk we have to take

1609
02:41:04,855 --> 02:41:07,855
 Ghazanavi one basline calling over
 - Ghazanavi one here, over

1610
02:41:10,494 --> 02:41:13,494
 Ghaznavi one, What's the
 situation there? Over

1611
02:41:13,563 --> 02:41:16,563
 The snake's still under
 the heel....over

1612
02:41:16,566 --> 02:41:19,566
 Good....keep it up...over & out

1613
02:41:22,639 --> 02:41:25,639
 Recognise the voice?
 - lt sounded familiar

1614
02:41:26,843 --> 02:41:29,078
 Brigadier Jamshed Baloch!

1615
02:41:29,079 --> 02:41:32,079
 l've heard this Brigadier
 is quite cunning and cruel

1616
02:41:33,250 --> 02:41:36,250
 You need men like him for
 jobs like this

1617
02:41:38,422 --> 02:41:41,422
 ls that why you're in charge
 of this peak, sir?

1618
02:41:45,562 --> 02:41:48,562
 You could say that

1619
02:41:50,434 --> 02:41:52,568
 Everything okay?
 - Yes, sir!

1620
02:41:52,569 --> 02:41:55,569
 A few more days and we're through

1621
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:58,541
 How is that, sir?

1622
02:41:58,542 --> 02:41:59,942
 There's been news that...

1623
02:41:59,943 --> 02:42:02,943
 Western powers will broker
 a ceasefire soon

1624
02:42:03,413 --> 02:42:06,413
 Then everyone stays put where
 they are now

1625
02:42:06,550 --> 02:42:09,550
 lt can't be that simple, sir

1626
02:42:14,324 --> 02:42:17,324
 That's what happened in 1948

1627
02:42:17,661 --> 02:42:20,661
 You see that highway down there?

1628
02:42:20,764 --> 02:42:23,764
 That road is lndia's neck!!

1629
02:42:24,167 --> 02:42:26,869
 Get a stranglehold on that...

1630
02:42:26,870 --> 02:42:29,870
 and lndia will lose the Siachen Glacier

1631
02:42:31,374 --> 02:42:34,374
 Siachen, today, and Kashmir, tomorrow!

1632
02:42:35,378 --> 02:42:38,378
 Insha Allah

1633
02:42:38,615 --> 02:42:41,317
 To control the highway,
 it's essential that

1634
02:42:41,318 --> 02:42:44,318
 we don't lose this peak!

1635
02:42:44,921 --> 02:42:47,656
 How can we lose it!

1636
02:42:47,657 --> 02:42:50,657
 Who can seize this peak from Maj.
 Shahbaaz Humdani!?

1637
02:42:52,295 --> 02:42:55,295
 They tried from here but failed

1638
02:42:56,166 --> 02:42:59,166
 Not only did we shoot
 the lndian soldiers

1639
02:42:59,636 --> 02:43:02,204
 We took our time to aim...

1640
02:43:02,205 --> 02:43:05,205
 and shoot them here!
 On the forehead!!

1641
02:43:06,042 --> 02:43:09,042
 They don't stand a chance!

1642
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:11,914
 Over here!

1643
02:43:11,915 --> 02:43:14,483
 3 kms of open plain field

1644
02:43:14,484 --> 02:43:17,219
 Even a madman wouldn't come this way

1645
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:20,220
 Behind us is Pakistan
 and there, a cliff!

1646
02:43:20,557 --> 02:43:23,557
 A 1000ft wall

1647
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:30,030
 Where will these lndians come from?

1648
02:45:17,474 --> 02:45:20,474
 lt's not far now, up there

1649
02:45:22,913 --> 02:45:24,980
 l'll try and get to it

1650
02:45:24,981 --> 02:45:27,981
 Okay, be careful

1651
02:48:36,005 --> 02:48:38,173
 Sir?

1652
02:48:38,174 --> 02:48:39,341
 What is it?

1653
02:48:39,342 --> 02:48:42,342
 l feel giddy, looking down

1654
02:48:42,378 --> 02:48:44,179
 Then do one thing.

1655
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:47,180
 Don't look down!
 - Right, sir

1656
02:49:07,704 --> 02:49:09,938
 Barasingha, can you hear me?

1657
02:49:09,939 --> 02:49:12,939
 Barasingha!!

1658
02:49:14,611 --> 02:49:15,711
 Yes, Pradeep?

1659
02:49:15,712 --> 02:49:17,679
 There's been no contact, sir

1660
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:20,482
 We don't know where they are

1661
02:49:20,483 --> 02:49:23,483
 l think we should send out
 a search party, sir

1662
02:49:24,821 --> 02:49:27,821
 Maybe tomorrow

1663
02:49:29,292 --> 02:49:32,292
 Today, we will stick to the plan

1664
02:49:35,698 --> 02:49:38,698
 Shelling starts at 0400 hrs

1665
02:49:39,969 --> 02:49:41,637
 Yes sir.

1666
02:49:41,638 --> 02:49:42,304
 Keep a lookout!

1667
02:49:42,305 --> 02:49:44,973
 They've attacked this side before

1668
02:49:44,974 --> 02:49:47,974
 They'll try again. any movement?
 - None, sir

1669
02:49:49,979 --> 02:49:51,213
 Even so, stay alert!

1670
02:49:51,214 --> 02:49:54,214
 lf they do come,
 it will be from here!

1671
02:49:54,817 --> 02:49:56,151
 Sir!

1672
02:49:56,152 --> 02:49:59,152
 The shelling has stopped

1673
02:50:01,424 --> 02:50:04,424
 Why did this shelling happen?
 Why did it stop?

1674
02:50:06,329 --> 02:50:09,329
 Shelling is done to provide
 cover to one's soldiers

1675
02:50:12,635 --> 02:50:15,635
 lf there's no one coming this way...

1676
02:50:17,307 --> 02:50:20,307
 To the cliff!

1677
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:24,110
 They must have scaled the wall, go!

1678
02:50:33,990 --> 02:50:36,990
 Move forward!

1679
02:51:27,610 --> 02:51:30,479
 Capt. Srivastav needs support!

1680
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:33,480
 Yes, sir!!

1681
02:51:46,129 --> 02:51:49,129
 This is Tiger's den
 Sir...Brig.Puri

1682
02:51:55,605 --> 02:51:57,806
 Yes sir

1683
02:51:57,807 --> 02:52:00,807
 What's the progress on the
 task you took up?

1684
02:52:03,112 --> 02:52:06,112
 Your 48 hr deadline is
 almost through

1685
02:52:08,985 --> 02:52:11,985
 Our team... that had...

1686
02:52:14,457 --> 02:52:16,792
 Sir... - Just a second sir
 Yes, Pradeep?

1687
02:52:16,793 --> 02:52:19,793
 We've heard gun fire on the feature
 - Okay

1688
02:52:21,130 --> 02:52:24,130
 Sir, l will report to
 you in a short while

1689
02:52:24,634 --> 02:52:27,634
 Right sir

1690
02:52:39,215 --> 02:52:42,215
 Grenade!
 - One more!

1691
02:52:56,666 --> 02:52:59,666
 Move forward, l'll cover you
 - Okay? - Sir...go

1692
02:53:40,777 --> 02:53:43,777
 Jai Hind!

1693
02:54:35,431 --> 02:54:38,431
 lt's no use resisting now!
 Vacate the post!!

1694
02:55:15,805 --> 02:55:18,805
 Don't worry, sir, he's breathing

1695
02:55:20,309 --> 02:55:23,309
 He's alive

1696
02:56:15,865 --> 02:56:18,865
 Pritam Singh was right
 They always come back!

1697
02:58:28,664 --> 02:58:31,664
 They have done it
 Our boys have reached!

1698
02:58:50,252 --> 02:58:53,252
 Inform Brigadier Puri

1699
02:58:57,326 --> 02:59:00,326
 Our boys have re-captured Peak 5179

1700
02:59:03,966 --> 02:59:06,966
 Objective achieved

1701
02:59:10,272 --> 02:59:13,272
 And we still have 2 mins left
 for the deadline

1702
02:59:24,253 --> 02:59:27,253
 Well done

1703
03:00:36,458 --> 03:00:39,458
 Well done, my son!

1704
03:00:45,301 --> 03:00:46,835
 Thanks dad

1705
03:00:46,836 --> 03:00:49,836
 Let's go home

1706
03:00:50,706 --> 03:00:53,706
 No, right now he has...
 to be someplace else

1707
03:01:20,736 --> 03:01:23,204
 Hi

1708
03:01:23,205 --> 03:01:25,807
 Hi

1709
03:01:25,808 --> 03:01:28,176
 You've achieved what you wanted

1710
03:01:28,177 --> 03:01:30,545
 Now what?

1711
03:01:30,546 --> 03:01:33,348
 Now l have a new objective
