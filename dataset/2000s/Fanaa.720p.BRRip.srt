00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,791
O Almighty.

3
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,291
"Our lndia is the best.."

4
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,916
"..of all the world by far"

5
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,833
"Our lndia is the best.."

6
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:01,374
"..of all the world by far"

7
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:05,541
"We are its buds."

8
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:10,374
"lt is our garden, all ours, ours."

9
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,374
"Our lndia is the best.."

10
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,458
"..of all the world by far"

11
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,666
This way.

12
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,208
Our tomorrow is based on our today

13
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,499
What we choose to do
today will decide..

14
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,666
..what happens to us tomorrow.

15
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,916
The choice isn't between
good and evil. That's easy.

16
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:44,499
The real choices of
life are choosing..

17
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:50,291
..between the lesser of two evils,
or the greater of two goods.

18
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:54,124
Now what do you choose,
Zooni, what's your choice?

19
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,499
Oh, leave my little girl alone!

20
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,791
Just listen to your heart dear..

21
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,541
..not your father's philosophy!

22
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:07,583
Try and take some decisions from the
heart rather than the brain, Zulfi

23
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,916
lf l'd used my brain you
wouldn't be here, Nafisa my love.

24
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,208
So? Zooni?

25
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,916
Papa, Mama, l really can't decide.

26
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:23,999
l'll do whatever you say.

27
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:30,333
So that's it. lt's decided.

28
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,583
Zooni will not go to Delhi.

29
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:41,416
l found my prince.
When will Zooni find hers?

30
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:46,541
When will some footballer
hit her head with a ball?

31
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,124
Any regrets?

32
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,541
Regrets?

33
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:55,208
l praise God every day that
the great Zulfikar Ali Beg's..

34
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,666
..penalty kick missed the goal..

35
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,333
..and hit me, square on the head.

36
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:02,166
lt was my worst kick ever!

37
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,666
Any regrets?

38
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,041
Regrets?

39
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:09,499
That's why l tended to you
in the hospital for a week.

40
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,041
We must accept that Zooni..

41
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,958
..may have to live her life
without that special someone.

42
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:21,916
That perhaps she will never marry.

43
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,166
And when we're gone who
will look out for her?

44
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:32,833
We must give her the
chance to live her life.

45
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,999
We need to support her independence.

46
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:41,708
Be her strength, not her weakness.

47
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:03,541
Madam Mehbooba

48
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,374
Bobo, the name is Bobo not Mehbooba

49
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,916
Whatever you command your highness.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,958
By the way, your bags
weigh more than your brain!

51
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,833
Obviously! Haven't
you heard that saying?

52
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:16,708
Which one? - "The buffalo
is bigger than the brain."

53
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,041
No dummy, it's "ls the
brain bigger or the buffalo?"

54
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,249
Fatty!
- Not Fatty, Fatima.

55
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,791
Don't know why you girls insist on
distorting perfectly good names.

56
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,291
Yes, Ruby.
- Not Ruby, Rubina.

57
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,249
come on.. take the bags at least!

58
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,541
lf we wouldve forgotten the bags..

59
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,041
l told you girls, no bags
on the births. Now, come on.

60
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,374
Pick it up and put it over here.

61
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:40,249
We have to represent Kashmir,
at a Republic Day performance..

62
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:43,916
..at the President's Palace, in front
of the chief Minister of Delhi..

63
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,499
..and what do l have to pull
this off? A bunch of wild cats!

64
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:50,958
lf we're a bunch of wild cats
what does that make our leader?

65
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:54,041
Who said that? Who said that?

66
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,458
You've carried your knitting?

67
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,833
When we're upset,
we say things to distract

68
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:03,583
Have you taken your knitting?
Kept your ticket safely?

69
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,041
Don't get off at a
station on the way."

70
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,416
God keep you safe.

71
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
Papa.. papa!

72
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,166
When papa's upset,
not just his voice

73
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,624
His walk also changes.

74
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,416
Yes, and he can't even cry
in front of all these girls.

75
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,874
But l have no such problem!

76
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,041
Mother.. mother.

77
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:32,916
l know you have to do this..

78
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,374
..but l don't know why, l'm afraid.

79
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:39,666
Afraid of what ?
Loosing me to some prince?

80
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,041
Oh, l wish! One look at you,
and he'll be on his knees

81
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,374
Heaven forbid! Will he be a porter?
Kneel to get my bags? - Hush!

82
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,333
Not a porter, not your bags,
he'll take your heart away.

83
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,791
With some poetry maybe..

84
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,999
.."Every once in a while
l get this feeling in my heart..

85
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:59,416
..that you were made
for me, all apart."

86
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,083
You were living in the mountains
somewhere before there was me."

87
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:07,291
You have been called down
to this earth, only for me."

88
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,374
l shall leave now.

89
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,416
God keep you safe, my child,
God keep you safe!

90
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,999
God keep you, mama.

91
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,291
Have a safe journey.

92
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,833
Be sure to say a prayer for me
at the Jama Masjid. - Yes, mama.

93
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:26,499
Take Zooni for an eye
test in the big city..

94
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:28,458
..and you, Rubina
take care of my baby!

95
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,708
Relax Aunty. Don't worry,
l'm here aren't l?

96
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:34,916
That's what l'm afraid of Fatima.
- lt's Fatty, aunty.

97
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,916
Bye dear, Bye Zooni!

98
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,124
Mama! Mama!

99
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,333
Yes, my child !

100
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:48,624
lf the Prince recites
poetry what should l say?

101
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,874
May my life's breath
find refuge in your heart..

102
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:56,333
..destroyed in your
love may my life depart."

103
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,499
Bye!

104
00:08:58,584 --> 00:09:00,083
Bye Mama!

105
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,083
Why do you do this?

106
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,124
You can say something as well.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
Rao!

108
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,249
Oh my God, coming maam.

109
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:29,916
Rao!
- Garbage everywhere.. idiot.

110
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,249
Lord Venkateshwa.
Rao at your service madam.

111
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,499
Now listen up, Rao.
We're here for just 7 days.

112
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,041
5 days to the show,
and 2 for holidaying.

113
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,624
l want to sight
- see Delhi, not your bald head.

114
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:43,291
Stand straight like a man!

115
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,791
l'm not even a man any more Madam.

116
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,541
After years of bowing
to government officers..

117
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,791
..l have come to this sorry state.

118
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,291
Today if l have children,
even they will be born bent over.

119
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,124
Oh, please. Shut up.

120
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,249
l have no interest in your
family planning program!

121
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,541
Where is that tour guide?

122
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,958
Hey you, cartoon Network.

123
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:08,999
Aunt.. l am the Balwaan.
Not the cartoon Network.

124
00:10:09,084 --> 00:10:10,874
You are exactly what you look like!

125
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,708
Now tell me what's the problem here?

126
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,624
Where do l start?

127
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,374
From the head light to the exhaust..

128
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,458
..there are problems
and more problems.

129
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:20,999
You think you are very funny?
- Thank you.

130
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,333
ldiot.
- Mention not.

131
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:25,374
l mean your tour guide.
Where on earth is he?

132
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:33,083
Don't look around the city
Forget the wasteland too"

133
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:39,041
Behold God's greatest creation.
Rehan is just above you."

134
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,333
Rehan..

135
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,583
"Marvelous."

136
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:47,041
Rehan.. Rehan Khan.

137
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:54,124
You Mr. Romeo.
Stop this cheap poetry!

138
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,916
l hate late comers.

139
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,499
come on, lets go, girls.
Lets go.

140
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:03,499
You didn't applaud me,
now at least help me

141
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:05,749
Oh, you're blind.

142
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,874
Yes, you didn't see that?
Are you blind too?

143
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,833
Thank God, l'm not.

144
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,249
That's a nice thing to
say to a blind person.

145
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,041
lf l was blind..

146
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:23,249
..l couldn't have seen the most
beautiful thing in the world, you.

147
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:26,416
"Marvelous."

148
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,083
Your beauty made God make a mistake,
what more can i say?

149
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:34,499
So that you don't caste an evil eye
on yourself, he took your eyes away."

150
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,666
"Marvelous."

151
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,416
Zooni, where are you?

152
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,041
l'm coming Fatty.

153
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,458
Fatty? ls that your
name or your dog's?

154
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:44,749
Shut up!

155
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:48,333
come on Balwante hit the gas!

156
00:11:56,584 --> 00:12:00,083
"lll lay my life for you."

157
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:03,666
"lll do such a thing."

158
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,333
"Friends, where will l go?"

159
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,666
..if l dont get
peace even after death."

160
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:14,791
"lll lay my life for you."

161
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,333
"lll do such a thing."

162
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,041
Heavenly!

163
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,916
..if l dont get
peace even after death."

164
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:37,124
lf wish l was a roll of wool..

165
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,124
..wrapped around her fingers..

166
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:45,041
lf you were a roll of wool,
with the needles.. l'd..

167
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:49,166
l wish she'd make a sweater out of
me, wear me, even in the summer.

168
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,958
Wow! What a thought!

169
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,708
Zooni, stop encouraging
his nonsense.

170
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:05,791
l am not the flower jasmine,
l am the flower rose.

171
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,249
l am your lifelong admirer,
not of your friend sitting close."

172
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,624
Hey Mr. Guide, your cheap poetry
is going to get you nowhere.

173
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,541
So, who are you
knitting this sweater for?

174
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,416
She's knitting it for a prince,
not for a devil like you.

175
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,874
And if she was interested in you ..

176
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,291
..she would speak up not sit silent.

177
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,041
Oh, so she does speak?

178
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,416
l knew she was blind,
thought she was mute too

179
00:13:32,542 --> 00:13:36,958
Zooni! Don't talk to him,
You don't know these men..

180
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,749
Looks like you know men very well.

181
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,874
Shut up!

182
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:48,833
lf you sit there in silence,
regret it you will.

183
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:53,458
So often after silence love
has awakened, stronger still."

184
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,958
Wonderful!

185
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:57,124
Bobo!

186
00:13:57,709 --> 00:13:58,958
Tommy, quiet..

187
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:05,249
There is no limit to human desire..

188
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,958
There is no limit to
human desire, no dearth.

189
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,541
After 2 yards of burial cloth,
we still want 2 yards of earth."

190
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,666
Superb!

191
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,458
Superb! Outstanding!

192
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:24,583
l'll look pain square in the eye,
face every test laid out for me.

193
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,708
For the sake of your friendship..

194
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,833
..dear friend,
l'll even love my enemy."

195
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,999
Oh yeah, l love your style!

196
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:43,583
The emperor Shah Jahan once
walked these lanes of the Red Fort.

197
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:48,499
And so did Mumtaz, his very,
very beautiful wife.

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,333
careful!

199
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,333
l can manage myself.

200
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,666
But how will l manage myself,
around you.

201
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,916
Ms. Bobo. Excuse me.

202
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,499
Shall we?

203
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,583
Bobo, tell me,
what does he look like?

204
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:16,916
Killer, girl, a real killer.

205
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:30,208
"Marvelous."

206
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:31,666
He's simply obnoxious!

207
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,166
He looks ok, so l thought
he must be a nice guy..

208
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,124
..but he called me a
stupid girl.. so..

209
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,166
And forget all his sweet talk..

210
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,624
.. the way he looks at women,
its shameful!

211
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,333
And he told me he doesn't believe
in God, can you imagine that?

212
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,499
Look even the crows
are cawing. lt's a sign.

213
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,291
Stay away from that Rehan guide.

214
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,416
How can you stay away
from me and go?

215
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,624
How can your heart forget me so?

216
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,166
That fragrance on your breath is me.

217
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,916
How ever will you stop,
not breathe?"

218
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,624
Great! Fabulous!

219
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,499
come on, let's go.
- come.

220
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:22,499


221
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:42,916
"Marvelous."

222
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:11,666
"lf the moon was to recommend me."

223
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,833
"This is what he'd say to you."

224
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:19,541
"l want to drop
the veil of decency."

225
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,541
"l want to cross
the line with you."

226
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,374
"l insist on destroying myself."

227
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,666
"On destroying myself in you."

228
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:35,249
"lf the moon was to recommend me."

229
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,291
"This is what he'd say to you."

230
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:43,124
"l want to drop
the veil of decency."

231
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,333
"l want to cross
the line with you."

232
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:14,374
"Your charms are
like a gentle breeze."

233
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:17,291
"Let them touch me as you pass."

234
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:22,208
"Your every move a graceful branch."

235
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,958
"Please move into my heart."

236
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:30,333
"come into my arms,
any excuse will do."

237
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:34,083
"For l must,
l must destroy myself in you."

238
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:38,166
"lf the moon was to recommend me."

239
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,416
"This is what he'd say to you."

240
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,166
"l want to drop
the veil of decency."

241
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,333
"l want to cross
the line with you."

242
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:32,749
"Marvelous."

243
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,958
"lf l tell you my true intentions."

244
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,208
"l'm sure they'll make you blush."

245
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:44,916
"lf l make you hear my heartbeats."

246
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,124
"l'm sure they'll
leave you flushed."

247
00:19:49,084 --> 00:19:52,916
"But l cannot hide
my feelings true."

248
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,374
"For l must, l must
destroy myself in you."

249
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,833
"lf the moon was to recommend me."

250
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,916
"This is what he'd say to you."

251
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,666
"l want to drop
the veil of decency."

252
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,916
"l want to cross
the line with you."

253
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,583
"l insist on destroying myself."

254
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:20,333
"On destroying myself in you."

255
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:46,166
Stand straight. Looking at
you l'm getting a backache.

256
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,333
And you Mr. cartoon Network..

257
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,874
..we have to leave for the
rehearsal at exactly 9 AM tomorrow.

258
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,208
So then leave.

259
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,499
lt's me. Rehan.

260
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:05,499
l know. Only you can be so impudent.

261
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:09,416
l want to be even more impudent.

262
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:15,208
l want you to run away with me.

263
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,541
l want to show you Delhi.

264
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:25,166
Without your bodyguards..

265
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,666
..don't say no,
not without thinking atleast

266
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,416
You'll anyway be
thinking about me so..

267
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,916
God forbid, the crows are cawing.

268
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:51,208
l'll wait for you after the
rehearsal tomorrow. With these crows.

269
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,874
"Marvelous."

270
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:04,249
You have had more girls in your life
than there is mileage on my bus.

271
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:07,124
Why do you want this blind girl?

272
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,874
What can l do Balwante,
everyone wants the moon.

273
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:16,999
There's just one headlight in
the sky, that shows us the way.

274
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,166
Now you want that too?

275
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,333
They say in love you
always loose sleep.

276
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:29,541
l wish someone would love me,
l bloody sleep and sleep and sleep."

277
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:32,958
Let's go.

278
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,708
Zooni! You must be tired,
go to sleep.

279
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,958
l feel awake after so many years.

280
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:51,083
l can't sleep now.
l can't sleep now.

281
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,916
l want to be even more impudent,
l want you to run away with me.

282
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,708
Why aren't you concentrating?

283
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,666
can l use your phone?

284
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,541
Pick up, mama!

285
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,541
This is one decision you'll
have to take on your own Zooni .

286
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,374
Oh Lord, how silly of me.

287
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:30,416
Of course there's no point in your
going sightseeing when you can't see.

288
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,958
No maam.
- Whats the point..

289
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,749
..when you cant see the sights.

290
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:36,541
Okay. You can go back to the
hostel after the rehearsal.

291
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,333
1 , 2..

292
00:23:40,959 --> 00:23:43,916
Fine! At least you'll be
away from that Rehan guide.

293
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:54,124
Brother, tell me something.
You stand here all day.

294
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:58,249
Don't you wish you were
inside on the President's chair?

295
00:23:58,334 --> 00:23:59,749
Why should l think that?

296
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:02,333
ln the police department
we regularly get promoted.

297
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:06,124
But once you're President, there's
no scope of promotion at all!

298
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,999
You're a very jolly man!

299
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,916
All thanks to my grandfather.

300
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,499
Grandfather? - My grandfather
worked for the British.

301
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:14,958
All day long he
would hear them say..

302
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:16,208
..'Jolly Good' this and
'Jolly Good' that.

303
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,958
When l was born he
was losing his memory.

304
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,999
All he remembered was 'Jolly Good'.

305
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,958
So that's what he
named me. Jolly Good.

306
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:25,249
Yes, yes have a laugh at me.

307
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:26,916
Even the officers
that pass by here say..

308
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,249
.."Jolly Good..
Singh" laugh and move on.

309
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,874
l think that's great.

310
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:34,291
Thanks to you,
the country is run in good spirits!

311
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,291
Thats Jolly Good Singh.

312
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,083
Rehan..

313
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:47,583
l felt God himself had blessed me.

314
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:52,624
When all she did was to address me.

315
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,749
Jolly Good

316
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,583
Rickshaw!

317
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:04,291
Hello.

318
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:08,708
Look, l sent Rana with
Balwaan and the bus.

319
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,416
No, l'm not coming today.

320
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:13,583
So what if l didn't tell you earlier.
l'm telling you now.

321
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:15,999
Let's go.
- You left work without permission?

322
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,583
So?

323
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,499
My father says that if a person
can't be loyal to their work..

324
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:23,458
..they can't be trusted
for anything.

325
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:24,999
Very good.

326
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:29,291
l've left work for you and you're
giving me a speech on loyalty?

327
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,416
My mother says there is
nothing bigger than loyalty.

328
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,333
lf you're done with your mother
and father's sermons can we go?

329
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,958
Why am l saying all this to you ?

330
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,583
Why are you saying all this to me?

331
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,374
So that l go back to work?

332
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,583
Yes.

333
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,374
Think about it, if l go
today l won't come back tomorrow.

334
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,958
l'll go back to the guest house,
you'll go back to work.

335
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,874
Tomorrow you'll take the day
off and then we'll go, ok?

336
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:04,333
Not okay.

337
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:10,833
You've heard what your
parents have said. Now hear me.

338
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:15,416
lf l go today l will
not come back tomorrow.

339
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,791
You'll come. Let's go.

340
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:28,166
l don't live the life of
the selfless..

341
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,166
..nor do l grab another's wine.

342
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:34,499
lf she has love let
her come and declare it..

343
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:38,541
..to ask her,
to follow her, l decline."

344
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:41,416
God be with you.

345
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:50,416
"Marvelous."

346
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:00,791
Greetings Ms. Zooni.

347
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,999
Greetings Mr. Jolly

348
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:05,416
l am wishing you and
you are wishing me.

349
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,874
Jolly good. Jolly good.

350
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,041
You know what happened yesterday?

351
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,249
Yesterday l said good
morning to 20 people..

352
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:12,666
..and they all said good
evening to me instead.

353
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,374
How can so many people be wrong?

354
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:17,041
lt was my watch that was wrong.
lt stopped in the morning..

355
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,249
..so l said 'good
morning' to people all day long!

356
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,958
l can't see Rehan today.

357
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,958
l can't see him either.

358
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,749
l think he's like me.
completely clean at heart..

359
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,916
..and completely muddled
in the head.

360
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:40,208
l couldn't quench my thirst with
water so l set off for the bar.

361
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,666
l gave up
complaining to God about you..

362
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,499
..for He is most
smitten by you, by far."

363
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,249
Jolly good. Jolly good.

364
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,499
"Marvelous."

365
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:54,958
l'm with you now.

366
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:57,624
So, how are you going to
show Delhi to a blind girl?

367
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,749
can you see me?

368
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,666
No.

369
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:14,499
What's my voice like?

370
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:22,749
Like the thunder before the storm.

371
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,666
What do l smell like?

372
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,916
Like the earth after
the first rain.

373
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,708
What do l feel like?

374
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,833
Like a prince in
a beggar's clothing

375
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:00,124
And just like this
you will see Delhi.

376
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:14,999
Watch out! This is the
Gateway of Blood.

377
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,458
The emperor
Aurangzeb had his brother..

378
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:20,374
..Dara Shikoh beheaded,
and hung his head up here. - there.

379
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,583
Exactly where you are standing.

380
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:25,374
And the British
government killed two sons and..

381
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:28,958
Rehan! -..a grandson of Bahadur
Shah Zafar, right there, behind you.

382
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:30,958
Rehan!

383
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:33,624
Please. That's enough.
Let's leave from here.

384
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,541
This is the bloody history of Delhi.

385
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:43,249
The Mughals, the British, a lot
of bloodshed had happened here

386
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:48,124
That's why, till today, tears
of blood flow from these walls.

387
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,499
Scared? What did you think?

388
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,166
l wouldn't get back
at you for yesterday?

389
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,291
And what did you think,
l'd get scared so easily?

390
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:03,041
When l have never seen any colors
how can the color of blood scare me?

391
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,124
Now you're scared.

392
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:40,541
"O Lord."

393
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,874
l'm going. l'm going to Delhi,
to get her back.

394
00:30:46,917 --> 00:30:49,624
lt's been 4 days. That's enough
to understand life. - Zulfi.

395
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:52,708
What'll be happening to
her without us? Just think?

396
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,874
She's brought up on home food,
she must be starving.

397
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:15,374
The Delhi crowds, who
will look out for her?

398
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,583
l'm not there.

399
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:26,708
"Marvelous."

400
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:29,583
l can't take her agony
any more, l'm going.

401
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:32,249
Are you going for her
sake or for your own?

402
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:08,499
Lets go.

403
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,416
You were right, Rehan.

404
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,416
You did show me Delhi.

405
00:32:24,584 --> 00:32:30,208
"Those people fall in love.."

406
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,124
Here is your rolled bread.

407
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:35,333
They say, the feelings
one gets for the country..

408
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,291
..in front of the
Eternal Soldier Flame..

409
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,874
..one gets for love in
front of the Taj Mahal.

410
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,166
Feelings, love,
that's all just talk.

411
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:52,916
When it comes down to basics
then needs are everything.

412
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:57,166
Needs of the stomach,
needs of the body

413
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,666
So you believe needs
are everything..

414
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,624
..and feelings are nothing?
- Yes.

415
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:05,749
So all this time
you're spending with me..

416
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,208
..is this also to fulfil some need?

417
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:17,874
You shouldn't tease a man
like me. My needs are great.

418
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,083
Even one chicken is not enough.

419
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,458
Even one girl is not enough.

420
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:38,666
So, Mr. Rehan, how
are things with you?

421
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,916
And how are you Zeenat?

422
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,833
Forgotten how l am?

423
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:50,249
come and meet me, l'll remind you.

424
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:56,499
lt's my fault actually.
He's been busy with me.

425
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:59,708
That's what makes
Rehan guide so special.

426
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:04,749
So, when do you plan on
being busy with me again?

427
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:10,999
l can't explain the ways
of this market to you,

428
00:34:12,459 --> 00:34:15,874
He who is sold, can't
ever be a buyer anew."

429
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:21,499
You'll never improve. Ever.

430
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:23,958
Good evening.

431
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,958
You seem to know her very well.

432
00:34:39,709 --> 00:34:40,916
That's me.

433
00:34:42,417 --> 00:34:47,249
l told you l only believe in needs..

434
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,458
..not in feelings or love.

435
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,541
And l only believe in love.

436
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,041
Meeting that guide on the sly.

437
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:10,791
Forget Helen, l can't
believe you lied to me!

438
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,583
This is just why l lied to you.

439
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,708
You're less of a
friend and more of a Hitler.

440
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:17,666
Hitler? l was just protecting you.

441
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,374
Not me. You were
protecting my blindness.

442
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:26,083
Zooni, how do l explain it to you?
He just isn't right for you.

443
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,374
Perhaps, but when l'm with him..

444
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,708
..l feel happy, feel alive.

445
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:38,041
And this feeling is special.
Very special.

446
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,374
But l don't like
that Guide. Not one bit.

447
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:43,958
And l don't care what you say.

448
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,708
l'll never let you
go with him. Never.

449
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,249
Turn off your light.

450
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,124
Good night, Fatty.

451
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:06,083
Hello, dear. good luck.
- Thank you, Mr. Jolly.

452
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:09,374
Jolly Singh! could you please allow
my good luck to come in? Please?

453
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,499
Don't insist. This tough
Sikh has a soft heart.

454
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:15,916
l'm sorry but rules are rules
and rules are never Jolly Good.

455
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:19,916
lt's ok. l know you're
only doing your duty.

456
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,666
But still,
l will be singing for him.

457
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,041
Thats Jolly Good.

458
00:36:23,209 --> 00:36:25,208
Thats Jolly bad, l say.

459
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:27,333
check her properly.

460
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:46,291
People say that after so
many years of lndependence..

461
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:48,874
..our Republic Day
has lost all meaning.

462
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,208
That it's just another holiday.

463
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:55,041
But it's not just a holiday for me.

464
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,416
This day marks the
birth of my country.

465
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,166
They say that the state
of our country is like..

466
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,291
..that of our old monuments.

467
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:07,333
What's beautiful
was only in the past.

468
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:11,874
l am blind so l don't see
the faults in my country..

469
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:16,083
..but why can't those who see,
see the beauty here?

470
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,666
What Emperor Shah Jahan had
said of my home state of Kashmir..

471
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:23,249
..we believe that's
true for all of lndia.

472
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:26,374
lf there is a heaven on earth..

473
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:30,249
..it is here, it is here,
it is here.

474
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:42,958


475
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:07,874
"The earth here
changes color at every step."

476
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:12,333
"The language here has
all the colors best."

477
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:16,874
"The earth here
changes color at every step."

478
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:21,458
"The language here has
all the colors best."

479
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:25,999
"The climes wear green
on their head."

480
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:31,083
"The sky lays a blue
sheet over it's bed."

481

"Golden river, Green ocean,
Every part so dressed."

482
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:53,583

"The sun with its
rose-tinted neck plays around."

485
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:29,249
"The yellow scarf of
flowers covers the shy ground."

486
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:31,958

00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:43,208
"My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color."

489
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:09,666
"Bright red faces all around,
smiling and glowing in fervour."

490
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:15,958
"colorful laughter,
colorful happiness..

491
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:19,416
..relationships full of color."

"color in promises, color in
memories, color, color, more color."

00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:33,291
"My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color."

494
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:15,291
"The color of love here runs so deep,
once its on it's there for keeps."

495
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:24,749
"The color of true love so still
simply glistens does not spill."

496
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:29,333
"color in charm, color in manner,
all colors full of flavor."

497
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:38,374
"My colorful, colorful country,
my country full of color."

504
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,791
Go Zooni, he's
waiting outside for you.

505
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,374
Thanks, Ruby.
- Hes so sweet.

506
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:58,583
He said l am the
cutest of all the girls.

507
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:01,666
After you of course, Zooni. Go.

508
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,666
Stop. You're not going anywhere.

509
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,041
Fatty.

510
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,708
certainly not like this.

511
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,458
With your hair all over the place.

512
00:43:11,542 --> 00:43:13,124
You haven't even worn
your stole properly.

513
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:15,291
l can't let you go like this.

514
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:16,916
You're really..

515
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,666
Ok, Ok, that's enough of that.

516
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,374
Go now.

517
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,499
So sweet, Fatty.
- Bobo.

518
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:31,916
Let's go.

519
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:42,333
The fire is in the sun, but it's
the earth that does the burning.

520
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:45,124
The eyes fall in love..

521
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,583
..but it's the heart
that does the suffering."

522
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:54,333
You're looking exceptionally
beautiful this evening.

523
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,333
Really?

524
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:59,124
You're looking exactly
the same to me.

525
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,874
You have brought me here? You ?

526
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,041
l thought you don't believe in God.

527
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:21,124
Will you just keep quiet for a bit?

528
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,791
Shut your eyes now.

529
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,083
Rehan, my eyes are always shut.

530
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,916
Rest your eyelids

531
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:49,041
They say this blessed
water does miracles.

532
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,916
l hope that's true.

533
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:04,166
No one has ever asked
for such a blessing for me.

534
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:11,124
l'm not asking for you,
l'm asking for myself.

535
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,874
Perhaps if your eyes are open
you'll keep your mouth shut!

536
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,249
lt's so loud!

537
00:45:24,917 --> 00:45:26,041
This is the real Delhi.

538
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,999
The quiet museums, Red Fort,
that's not the real Delhi.

539
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:32,249
This is the sound of Delhi.
the essence of Delhi

540
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:34,458
l wish l was deaf as well ..

541
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,083
Just a minute. Wait here.

542
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,583
Hello.
- Rehan..

543
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:39,999
Yes, it's me.

544
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:41,333
Rehan.

545
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,708
Yes, yes, l got it alright.

546
00:45:45,792 --> 00:45:47,208
Rehan, you're watching me,
aren't you?

547
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:48,833
Rehan..

548
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:52,624
Zooni!

549
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:56,041
What's this madness?

550
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,708
l just wanted to show you.

551
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:00,166
Show what? That you're such a fool?

552
00:46:00,584 --> 00:46:02,208
No..
- l'll call you later.

553
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,541
Boys, and girls you know..

554
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:10,583
..they impress each other on
their first dates. So l too.

555
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:14,708
l am so sorry.

556
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:16,958
Your life is very precious Zooni..

557
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,374
..don't waste it on anyone.
certainly not on me.

558
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:26,208
My mother says, to gain something
you have to loose something.

559
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,958
Oh God!

560
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,708
Mother says this, father says that..

561
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:33,499
..where is Zooni in all this?
What does Zooni say?

562
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,916
Nobody's ever asked Zooni

563
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,124
l'm asking you. Tell me.

564
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,249
l like you.

565
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:50,666
Let's go.

566
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,874
Now you're scared.

567
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:09,874
"O Almighty."

568
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:23,208
Our destiny has brought us
these precious moments today

569
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:34,624
Look at me up close,
imbibe me in every way

570
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,708
You're still scared.

571
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:46,791
Just in case your fate
has another card to play

572
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:51,333
Think we'll never meet again,
just suppose..

573
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,333
..not till this lifetime
is forever closed

574
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,666
l'll manage from here.

575
00:47:59,917 --> 00:48:02,541
come in to my arms, hold me close..

576
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:09,666
..we may never again
have this night's repose

577
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:16,041
Think we'll never meet again,
just suppose..

578
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:21,333
..not till this lifetime
is forever closed

579
00:48:22,834 --> 00:48:25,291
come in to my arms, hold me close..

580
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:32,583
..we may never again
have this night's repose

581
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:38,374
Think we'll never meet again,
just suppose..

582
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:43,583
not till this
lifetime is forever closed

583
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:46,874
"Embrace me."

584
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:48,666
Where is Rehan the gorgeous?

585
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,916
What's the time, Bobo?

586
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:52,499
Ten thirty

587
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:57,374
My watch is fine, why is he late?

588
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:59,041
lt's our last day.

589
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:03,083
Maybe he's getting you
a gift, so he's late.

590
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,499
He himself is a gift.

591
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:08,749
No news?

592
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,374
No.

593
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:22,708
No Fatty. Nothing yet.

594
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:26,583
Mama.

595
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:27,874
Zooni!

596
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:30,499
How are you my child?

597
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:33,666
We saw the performance on TV.

598
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,499
lt was fantastic.

599
00:49:35,584 --> 00:49:39,749
When everyone stood up to clap.
Your father and me..

600
00:49:39,834 --> 00:49:43,583
l want to speak to
you about something.

601
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:44,874
What is it? Tell me.

602
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:48,916
When papa and you first met.

603
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:53,166
After he tended to
you in the hospital..

604
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:57,583
..if he had suddenly disappeared.
What would you have done?

605
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:00,916
l would have asked him
why he was misbehaving.

606
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,041
And told him to stop
his nonsense immediately.

607
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:07,249
Misbehaving? Who is misbehaving?

608
00:50:07,334 --> 00:50:09,124
So is that what l should do?

609
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:11,666
Who is he?
- Who is who?

610
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:14,166
Rehan.

611
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,999
Rehan?
- Rehan?

612
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,666
So, do you love him?

613
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,291
Do you love him? What are
you saying? Give me the phone.

614
00:50:21,375 --> 00:50:23,541
Just a minute. - Give me the phone.
l'll deal with this.

615
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:27,083
Yes.
- So what have you decided?

616
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:32,499
Nothing. l don't think he loves me.

617
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:35,499
Just remember one thing dear..

618
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:38,958
..give your life for the
one who gives you his love..

619
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:42,416
..but give your
self-respect only to..

620
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,791
..the one who is willing to
be destroyed for your love.

621
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:53,999
This is Humayun's tomb.

622
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,249
lt was constructed for
him by his wife Hamida.

623
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:59,166
Take a look at what a
wife made for her husband.

624
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,499
And you can't even
make me breakfast.

625
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:05,916
Don't worry, l'll start
building your tomb right away.

626
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,124
come.. - l am blind and you
are the one who can't see me..

627
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:15,374
lf by mistake l have made a mistake..

628
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,416
..then please consider it
a mistake and forget it.

629
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,291
But only forget the mistake..

630
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,999
..even by mistake
don't ever forget me."

631
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,999
Heard that? Great!

632
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,333
Take them ahead.

633
00:51:35,209 --> 00:51:36,916
Let's go.
- But our guide?

634
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,874
No but! Only Jat!

635
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:45,749
Move it! Look here,
the Qutub Minar.

636
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:53,791
No Zooni, Fatty was right.

637
00:51:55,375 --> 00:52:00,249
You should love a prince,
not a devil like me.

638
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:07,999
lt's too late now. Now
this devil is my prince.

639
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:14,833
l can't give you anything.

640
00:52:16,209 --> 00:52:21,458
Remember l told you, l believe
in needs, not in feelings or love.

641
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:27,999
Women are like cities for me.

642
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:32,041
l spend some time in one.

643
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,666
l get to know it,
get immersed in it..

644
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,583
..and then move to another city.

645
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:42,374
This is me, and l can't change.

646
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:49,374
Look Rehan, all this stuff
about princes is good..

647
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,749
..in dreams and stories.

648
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:55,583
ln reality l have found you.

649
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:59,624
We haven't met by chance,
we've met by destiny.

650
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:02,166
lf not the rest of our lives..

651
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,208
..we can spend the next
1 2 hours together, can't we?

652
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:12,333
Perhaps that's all we have,
just today, just now.

653
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:23,791
Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.

654
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,708
May my life's breath
find refuge in your heart

655
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:38,416
May my life's breath
find refuge in your heart.

656
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:42,291
Destroyed in your love
may my life depart."

657
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:44,416
"O Almighty."

658
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:50,291
How can you love me so much?

659
00:53:52,459 --> 00:53:55,458
How can anyone love
another so much?

660
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:08,333
l promise you this Zooni Ali Beg..

661
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:13,541
..the next 1 2 hours will be
the most beautiful of your life.

662
00:54:32,792 --> 00:54:42,791


663
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,458
"The raindrops have a conspiracy."

664
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:21,333
"They have a silent wish, a plea."

665
00:55:21,417 --> 00:55:24,291
"The raindrops have a conspiracy."

666
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:27,083
"They have a silent wish, a plea."

667
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:37,624
"Look, just see."

668
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:41,166
"Softly, slowly this gentle breeze."

669
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,166
"Says so much, listen please."

670
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:49,833
"Why the distance
between you and me."

671
00:55:50,667 --> 00:56:01,874
"Look, just see."

672
00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:26,333
"Rain."

673
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:38,916
"Never again will the
winds be this shameless."

674
00:56:40,417 --> 00:56:45,083
"Never again will our
steps falter so blameless."

675
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:51,041
"Never again will the
winds be this shameless."

676
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:56,833
"Never again will our
steps falter so blameless."

677
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:03,666
"This rain is not so straight,
it has a twist."

678
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:08,666
"lt's telling us
something as it pours and mists."

679
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:19,874
"Just understand it."

680
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,666
"Softly, slowly this
gentle breeze."

681
00:57:22,834 --> 00:57:25,833
"Says so much, listen please."

682
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:31,708
"Why the distance
between you and me."

683
00:57:31,917 --> 00:57:43,374
"Look, just see."

684
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:29,166
"Desire, like a fire-fly,
glows bright then dim."

685
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:35,083
"lt's such a sweet
predicament that we're in."

686
00:58:35,834 --> 00:58:40,833
"Desire, like a fire-fly,
glows bright then dim."

687
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:46,583
"lt's such a sweet
predicament that we're in."

688
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:53,666
"Don't discard the request
from our lips like this."

689
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:58,249
"Don't call this wish
of our breathe remiss."

690
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:09,666
"Just touch, Feel this."

691
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:12,541
"Softly, slowly this
gentle breeze."

692
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:15,583
"Says so much, listen please."

693
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:21,124
"Why the distance
between you and me."

694
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:45,541
"Look, just see."

695
01:00:08,584 --> 01:00:13,416
Rehan! Wake up. Wake up.

696
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,624
Rehan! Wake up.

697
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:19,624
My train is at 1 0. lf you don't
wake up l'll miss it.

698
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:23,499
l spoke to Fatty and she's
bringing my things to the station.

699
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:27,999
We don't have to go to the
guest house. You Sleep so much!

700
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,624
Wake up! Don't you have
to go to work as well?

701
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,624
And don't you dare miss work today

702
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:35,249
See l forgot, Mama had told
me to get the eye test done.

703
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,624
And Papa has asked for a chess set.

704
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:41,083
can we stop and get one on
the way? Do we have time?

705
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,374
Rehan! Are you listening?

706
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:53,249
Oh, l didn't even say
goodbye to Jolly Good Singh.

707
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,083
You please tell him for me.

708
01:00:56,917 --> 01:01:01,083
Here's my address..

709
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,333
Will you write to me?

710
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:07,208
ls this your wife's first
visit home after marriage?

711
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:28,458
l want to say..

712
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:29,708
No, Rehan.

713
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:34,583
You made no promises and l
will not ask you for anything.

714
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:40,999
l always wanted love to be the
most important thing in my life..

715
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,499
..and now, thanks to you, it is.

716
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,624
You were wrong Rehan.

717
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:55,374
l am not destroyed in
your storm l am rejuvenated.

718
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:07,374
Now your picture will
remain with me always.

719
01:02:15,584 --> 01:02:17,124
And now l can't leave.

720
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,916
Not until you step off my stole.

721
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:40,958
God be with you Rehan, be happy.

722
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:01,166
Zooni!

723
01:03:03,459 --> 01:03:17,166
"O Almighty."

724
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:30,791
Now can l say l told you so

725
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:34,374
No

726
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:37,416
l won't say it. l'll never say it.

727
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:43,708
May my life's breath
find refuge in your heart."

728
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,791
Rehan.

729
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,708
May my life's breath
find refuge in your heart.

730
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:56,291
Destroyed in your love
may my life depart."

731
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,541
Zooni..
- Rehan!

732
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:12,708
Fatty! lf not for me at least
pull the chain for Zooni.

733
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,166
With pleasure.

734
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:23,333
What's going on?
What is the guide doing here?

735
01:04:23,417 --> 01:04:25,624
The brave heart is
taking the bride.

736
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:41,041
"Marvelous."

737
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,583
He wants to marry you?

738
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:45,124
What? Who is he? Where is he from?

739
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:46,874
What does he do? What does he
look like? He wants to marry her!.

740
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,999
They love each other.

741
01:04:49,292 --> 01:04:50,916
So what did you say?

742
01:04:50,959 --> 01:04:54,583
What could l say? l said
he must ask my parents.

743
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:55,749
What did she tell him?

744
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:56,999
She's our daughter..

745
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:59,749
..she wouldn't give any
answer without our consent.

746
01:05:00,042 --> 01:05:04,749
Zooni, l have complete
faith in your choice.

747
01:05:04,959 --> 01:05:07,999
Yes, my darling, tell him yes.

748
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:11,291
And we're coming to Delhi
right away to get you married.

749
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,416
come quickly mama, l miss you.

750
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,416
Now where are you off to?

751
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,458
We're going to Delhi
aren't we? We'll need tickets.

752
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,833
As usual he runs away the
moment there are tears in his eyes.

753
01:05:26,209 --> 01:05:29,416
God keep you mama, God keep you.

754
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:32,041
God keep you my child, God keep you.

755
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,249
Our daughter has found her prince.

756
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:45,041
She has found her prince.

757
01:05:53,959 --> 01:05:56,874
When did you last
get your eyes checked ?

758
01:05:57,542 --> 01:05:59,874
l don't remember.
Many years ago in Srinagar.

759
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:01,124
This is the problem.

760
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:06,583
We doctors go on about
checkups and no one listens.

761
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,416
These days science
has progressed so much.

762
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,749
What was impossible 5
years ago is possible today .

763
01:06:13,167 --> 01:06:14,249
What do you mean?

764
01:06:14,334 --> 01:06:18,374
Retinal replacement can help you.

765
01:06:18,584 --> 01:06:20,124
The chances are very slim..

766
01:06:20,334 --> 01:06:22,166
..l warn you, but
there is still a chance.

767
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,999
Are you saying Zooni
will be able to see?

768
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,041
There's a chance..

769
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:31,749
We'll take the chance doctor.

770
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:34,416
l'll check the first available date.

771
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,666
There won't be any problem doctor?

772
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,708
The operation must go well.

773
01:06:47,959 --> 01:06:51,374
Don't worry our best team is on it.

774
01:06:51,709 --> 01:06:53,916
l'll meet you after the operation.

775
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:55,458
Thank you.

776
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:07,208
Rehan! You're hugging
me for the 1 0th time.

777
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:12,249
l'm not complaining,
but please don't worry.

778
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,208
l'll be fine.

779
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:19,374
lf you're so worried then why
didn't we wait for mama and papa?

780
01:07:20,875 --> 01:07:22,916
We could have done
this after the wedding?

781
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,999
Let's go, it's time.

782
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:34,083
Don't forget to get mama
and papa from the station.

783
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:37,291
And Jolly Good wants to
come here later as well.

784
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,541
You're going to the
President's Palace, right?

785
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:41,083
Yes.

786
01:07:47,834 --> 01:07:49,333
Zooni!

787
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:05,249
l love you very much.

788
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:11,874
l know.

789
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:17,708
After the bomb blast in Peshawar..

790
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,583
..Pakistan the lndependent
Kashmir Front has demanded..

791
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:23,083
..that both lndia and
Pakistan leave Kashmir.

792
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,291
They want an lndependent Kashmir..

793
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:28,541
..or else there will be
many more attacks to come.

794
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:47,749
The chief Minister is alive..

795
01:08:47,834 --> 01:08:51,916
..but as per early reports, 8
security officers have been killed.

796
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,749
And at least 1 5
others are badly wounded.

797
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:57,291
The main building has
not been harmed very much..

798
01:08:57,375 --> 01:09:01,833
..but the left side of it
has been completely destroyed.

799
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:03,791
2 terrorists have been
captured and..

800
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:06,374
..the lKF have claimed
responsibility.

801
01:09:06,459 --> 01:09:08,708
Their demand is that lndia
and Pakistan leave Kashmir.

802
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:10,124
Maam.. move aside.

803
01:09:10,209 --> 01:09:12,499
And let it be
an independent country.

804
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:33,833
Zooni..

805
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:45,916
Mummy.

806
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:47,833
My child

807
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:52,166
Mama l can see, l can see.
- Yes, my darling.

808
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,833
Papa l can see.

809
01:09:58,084 --> 01:10:00,333
You can cry in front of
me now papa.

810
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:04,916
l can see you cry.

811
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:08,999
But where is Rehan?
He's not with you?

812
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,958
Didn't he get you
from the station?

813
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:20,416
Papa, where are they taking us?

814
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,541
Why has your breathing
changed papa?

815
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,624
Why? l don't understand.

816
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:30,416
Mama, where is Rehan?
Why aren't we waiting for him?

817
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:37,541
Mama why are you crying?
Mama? Papa?

818
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:46,708
Why are you crying mama?
Papa where are we?

819
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:47,916
Please let me go from here.

820
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,333
ls it necessary to do this now?
- Yes Ma'am.

821
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,541
What do we have to do?

822
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:53,458
Why can't we wait for Rehan?

823
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,333
Papa, where are we? Papa?

824
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,999
l'm getting suffocated here papa.

825
01:10:57,084 --> 01:10:58,624
Please let's go.
Mama let's go. Please.

826
01:10:58,709 --> 01:11:00,249
The bomb blast
at the President's Palace.

827
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,999
What do we have to do with that?
We don't know anything.

828
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:06,583
You're still crying mama,
please don't.

829
01:11:06,959 --> 01:11:11,249
Please, papa get me out.
- Doctor?

830
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:13,166
Zooni..

831
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:18,458
l was going to identify him, but
his state was such that l could not.

832
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,166
So you have to identify him,
Zooni. ls this Rehan?

833
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:23,749
"O Almighty."

834
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:29,416
No! lt can't be Rehan. lt can't!

835
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:34,916
Please, don't make my
daughter go through this. Please.

836
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:36,541
l am sorry, sire.

837
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,041
lt's compulsory.

838
01:11:50,584 --> 01:11:55,166
Zooni my darling,
even this is life.

839
01:12:03,167 --> 01:12:05,416
lf only l was a roll of wool..

840
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:07,541
..wrapped around her fingers..

841
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,124
'That fragrance
on your breath is me.'

842
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:25,208
'How ever will you stop,
not breathe?'

843
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:33,999
'How can you love me so much?
How can anyone love another so much?'

844
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:37,083
"O Almighty."

845
01:12:40,084 --> 01:12:43,791
'Don't come close to me,
this storm will destroy you.'

846
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:56,958
'Think about it, if l go today
l won't come back tomorrow.'

847
01:12:57,042 --> 01:12:58,333
Rehan!

848
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:09,041
At this time we are at the
Bureau of Military lntelligence.

849
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:13,124
There is not much information
forthcoming on the blast..

850
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:15,541
..but here is the head of
the Anti-Terrorist Unit.

851
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:17,124
Mr. Susheel Rawat. Mr. Rawat.

852
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:19,124
What can you tell us
about the blast?

853
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:22,666
When we know more.
We'll tell you more.

854
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,916
But something to go on,
who is responsible.

855
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:27,249
Thats all l can tell you now.
These media people.

856
01:13:27,334 --> 01:13:30,499
They start 24 hour channels and
then get after us to fill the time.

857
01:13:30,584 --> 01:13:32,666
Dont worry, sir.
Everything is under control.

858
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,749
Sir, Tyagi has been called
from intelligence agency RAW

859
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:40,958
Tyagi? Now things
will be out of control.

860
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,458
So Tyagi, case solved yet?

861
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:56,666
So what does your
psychology mumbo-jumbo say?

862
01:13:58,834 --> 01:13:59,999
This is his work.

863
01:14:00,084 --> 01:14:02,624
Who? Who are you talking about?

864
01:14:03,959 --> 01:14:05,416
These two are telling the truth.

865
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,291
They haven't seen him.

866
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:10,291
They were simply given instructions.

867
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:13,708
The master planner is someone else.

868
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:17,499
Do you need an invitation to
tell me his name? Who is it?

869
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:22,708
This man has changed
the face of the lKF.

870
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:29,249
He has taken a rag-tag group and
made it a professional organization.

871
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:32,166
A group on par with the
most deadly in the world.

872
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:38,916
On par with the best intelligence
agencies in the world.

873
01:14:39,917 --> 01:14:42,041
lt's because of this
man that 8 ships and..

874
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:45,499
..a large part of the
Bombay port are under water.

875
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:48,708
lt's because of this man that
lslamabad airport's new wing..

876
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:51,166
..was destroyed even
before it could be completed.

877
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:56,124
He has changed the face of
terrorism in lndia and Pakistan

878
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,208
Those blood shot eyes and..

879
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:05,833
.. fanatical terrorists
are a thing of the past.

880
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:08,749
This man is a thinker. A planner.

881
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:10,416
No one knows his name.

882
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:15,416
No one knows his past,
or where he comes from.

883
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,124
He can be anyone.

884
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:21,666
The man sitting next
to you on the train..

885
01:15:21,875 --> 01:15:25,583
..or a bank teller, or even
the cigarette seller outside.

886
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:31,458
He is intelligent and he's
dangerous, and he can be anyone.

887
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:33,916
We have to find him.

888
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,083
For if we don't, he can take
terrorism to a level beyond..

889
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:41,416
..our imagination because our
imagination is nothing like his.

890
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,458
l'm sorry Grandfather, the mission
was not entirely successful.

891
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,666
l had set everything.

892
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,541
Those fools just didn't
follow instructions.

893
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:43,499
Not everyone can be like my grandson.
A perfect soldier.

894
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:47,083
But even he slipped this once.

895
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,124
That too for some woman.

896
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,916
lt's very unusual that you
were carried away like this.

897
01:16:55,084 --> 01:16:56,999
And the woman what about her?

898
01:16:57,084 --> 01:16:58,583
She is with God.

899
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,791
Now listen to me.

900
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:04,291
You don't have to worry
about this soldier Sir.

901
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:06,499
My concentration was, is..

902
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:08,374
..and will always
remain on our independence.

903
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,333
l am a soldier and nothing else.

904
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,999
That's all l wanted to hear my son.

905
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,874
Now l'll meet you after
the Bangkok operation.

906
01:17:17,084 --> 01:17:18,541
May God keep you safe.

907
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:31,708
You had taken me to my goal, Zooni.

908
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:34,958
should never have
taken you off that train.

909
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,291
But l became weak.

910
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,374
And l fell in love with you.

911
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:44,666
l hope you can forgive me.

912
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:48,458
l should never have
brought you into my life. Never.

913
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,624
Sorry, l fell in love with you.

914
01:17:56,459 --> 01:17:57,958
Sorry, Zooni.

915
01:18:03,209 --> 01:18:04,916
God be with you, Zooni.

916
01:18:06,375 --> 01:18:19,374
"O Almighty."

917
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:34,332
You are the Defence Secretary.
You must be having some powers.

918
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:36,874
Do something. Get
that Tyagi off my back!

919
01:18:36,958 --> 01:18:39,124
Last year the Al-Qaeda's
attempt on Delhi airport ..

920
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:41,041
..was foiled by Tyagi.

921
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,332
She got lucky, once.

922
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,332
And now she thinks she's a
big shot intelligence officer.

923
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,082
l can't do anything now.

924
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:49,457
The Defence Minister himself
has asked her to be on this case.

925
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:52,124
Sir, it's nothing less
than the Armageddon.

926
01:18:52,708 --> 01:18:55,332
The press shouldn't
even get a whiff of this.

927
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:58,457
This lKF has made our life hell.

928
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:02,416
First the President Palace
bombing then Karachi Oil refinery..

929
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:04,749
..and last year it was
the plane hijacking.

930
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:08,874
And now we hear
they've stolen parts..

931
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:13,166
..from us Pakistan and Russia..

932
01:19:13,917 --> 01:19:16,707
..and are ready with
a nuclear missile!

933
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:20,499
Sir, This is their way of
forcing lndia out of Kashmir.

934
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:23,957
When Kashmir's ruler, Hari Singh,
decided to join lndia in 1 947..

935
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:26,332
..then why this talk
of independence now?

936
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:29,916
But the Kashmiri's had
also been promised a vote..

937
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,916
..a referendum to decide
whether they wanted to stay..

938
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:37,791
..a part of lndia, join Pakistan
or then be independent.

939
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,666
All these years later they are
still to get that referendum.

940
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,457
What referendum
are you talking about?

941
01:19:42,667 --> 01:19:47,457
When half of Kashmir is occupied
by Pakistan, how is it possible?

942
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:49,999
A referendum needs to
include all of Kashmir..

943
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,166
..why should it include only half?

944
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,416
Mr. Rawat.

945
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,749
This is not an lndia-Pakistan
issue any more.

946
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:58,832
lKF wants both lndia and
Pakistan to leave Kashmir.

947
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:02,332
They want a separate country.
An independent Kashmir.

948
01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:06,874
Please, l know the
history of lndia and Pakistan.

949
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:08,832
Tell me about this bomb.

950
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:12,999
How powerful is this bomb,
Mrs. Tyagi, and what are the dangers?

951
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:17,124
ln the last few years over 1 5,000
people have been killed in Mumbai,

952
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:23,207
Oklahoma city, New York, Bali,
Madrid and London.

953
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:25,707
And losses have run into millions.

954
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,624
But if they use this bomb

955
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:32,499
5 million people can die.

956
01:20:33,167 --> 01:20:35,374
An entire city can be destroyed.

957
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:38,832
That city can also be
our capital, New Delhi.

958
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:42,749
We must stop this bomb.
Whatever it takes.

959
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,332
But Sir, this bomb
is useless for them.

960
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:47,874
What do you mean?

961
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:50,457
The missile needs a special,
lndian made trigger.

962
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:54,749
lf they don't have that,
they can't use the bomb

963
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:59,749
Only until they get the trigger.
Only until then.

964
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:03,541
Sir, there's nothing to
worry about. Outside Delhi,

965
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,916
We have 6 triggers at various
military bases around the country.

966
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:08,749
ln Rajasthan, Kutch, Darjeeling,

967
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:11,707
Amritsar, Leh and Kashmir.
They are safe there.

968
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,957
l want all the
triggers brought to Delhi.

969
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:17,499
ln the next 1 2 hours
they will all be here, Sir.

970
01:21:18,042 --> 01:21:20,749
Get me the Defence
Minister of Pakistan,

971
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:23,749
..l want to share this
information with him. - Yes, sir.

972
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,124
We can be sure. Just as we are
taking steps to secure the triggers,

973
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:29,666
lKF's mastermind will be
taking steps to steal them.

974
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,416
Pass. Pass me.

975
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,874
Pass here, come on.

976
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:42,499
captain Ranjeev.

977
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:52,082
Hit! captain Ranjeev!

978
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,624
Major Suraj!

979
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:09,082
Brigadier for you, sir!
- coming!

980
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,916
Yes, sir. l understand, sir.

981
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:14,207
My unit has a 1 00%
success rate on missions, Sir.

982
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:16,624
And l will bring this
trigger to you myself.

983
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,749
Be alert. lKF will be
after you at every step.

984
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,832
lf the weather holds up, the trigger
will be with you in 3 hours, Sir.

985
01:22:22,917 --> 01:22:25,041
Glory to lndia! - Over and out, sir.
Glory to lndia!

986
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:27,207
captain Ranjeev.

987
01:22:28,292 --> 01:22:30,749
This is the day
every soldier lives for.

988
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,874
The last time you
saved me from the lKF.

989
01:22:34,167 --> 01:22:37,291
Today we both must save
the country from the lKF.

990
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,999
This soldier is ready to take
lives or to give his own life.

991
01:22:44,083 --> 01:22:45,666
Anything for his motherland, Sir.

992
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:48,582
Get the boys ready.
- Yes, sir.

993
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:54,291
Good news.

994
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:59,166
The trigger will be with us soon.

995
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,332
God keep Rehan!

996
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:04,916
God is great!

997
01:23:06,042 --> 01:23:07,749
captain Ranjeev.

998
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,624
Thank you.

999
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:15,874
Hi, baby.

1000
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,041
Mummy is fine. How are you?

1001
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,791
Mummy will save the country

1002
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,124
l know you wanted custard.

1003
01:23:23,292 --> 01:23:25,707
But Grandma has made rice pudding
with so much love, so please eat it.

1004
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,832
What have you brought?
Rice pudding or custard?

1005
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,416
We've checked the list of
officers coming from Kashmir.

1006
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,707
Everything is okay.

1007
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:34,957
How can it not be ok?
l have hand-picked these officers.

1008
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:38,832
They are the army's
very best, elite forces.

1009
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:41,332
Ok, so that's where he is.
- Who?

1010
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:43,624
An ace officer from the Jat
Regiment Sir, captain Ranjeev.

1011
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:48,457
His wife reported he hadn't
called her for a couple of months.

1012
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:52,082
She wanted to know if he
was on some secret mission.

1013
01:23:52,125 --> 01:23:54,457
That's wives for you.

1014
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:57,749
Am sure she was after him
with some pudding or such.

1015
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,207
Poor man must have
needed a break from..

1016
01:23:59,292 --> 01:24:00,832
..all that so he
didn't call, understandable.

1017
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:03,541
He didn't call his
wife for two months?

1018
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:06,707
Just find out, was his last
mission to do with the lKF?

1019
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,124
Right, maam.

1020
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:13,624
Yes Ma'am. Major Suraj's
regiment was surrounded by the lKF.

1021
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:17,166
At the last moment captain Ranjeev's
regiment got there and saved them.

1022
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,874
Everyone from captain
Ranjeev's regiment was killed.

1023
01:24:19,958 --> 01:24:22,541
Only he survived.

1024
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,124
Oh my God.

1025
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:28,791
That's him! We have to stop him!

1026
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:37,166
Sounds like the base
is trying to contact us.

1027
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:39,332
The signal is too weak.

1028
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:52,082
Alpha 1 to Eagle. Do you read me?

1029
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,874
lt's amazing isn't it? Such a small
thing can take so many lives.

1030
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:57,582
Our lives too, in it's defence
- So?

1031
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:59,207
l'm not afraid of dying Sir,

1032
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:01,541
But it's better to kill for
your country than be killed

1033
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:05,624
You want to kill people? Make
them eat your wife's cooking!

1034
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:12,082
Santosh!

1035
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,957
Ajay!

1036
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:17,832
Eijaz!

1037
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:28,499
Ranjeev!

1038
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:40,082
You are dying the
death of a brave soldier.

1039
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:43,957
He who dies on the
battlefield goes to heaven.

1040
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:48,374
God keep you.

1041
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:45,541
Grandfather. l am not empty handed.

1042
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:50,207
Praise be to God! You don't have
just a trigger there with you.

1043
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:56,374
lt is our decades long dream.
We have sacrificed so much for.

1044
01:26:57,083 --> 01:27:03,832
You must get that
trigger to us now at any cost.

1045
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:08,082
Kill, or be killed.

1046
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,541
Yes, grandfather.

1047
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:12,249
l will meet you in 3 hours
At Shikara 1 pick up point.

1048
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,082
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1049
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:17,332
l was right. That was no accident.

1050
01:27:17,625 --> 01:27:19,291
He was in the helicopter.

1051
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,582
Jam all the phone lines
in the area,..

1052
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:24,874
..mobiles, satellite, internet,
everything.

1053
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:26,207
l want a communications blackout.

1054
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:31,124
We can't jam radio signals, we have
military operations in that area

1055
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:36,624
lf you can't jam them, you can
at least monitor them, can't you?

1056
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,499
Search the entire area.

1057
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,916
come on, boys. Lets get going!
- Yes, sir.

1058
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,832
How far is the road unit?

1059
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:09,916
No! He's still alive.

1060
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:14,666
l don't care how
many bodies you saw.

1061
01:32:15,042 --> 01:32:18,082
l know Rehan will
reach the pick up point.

1062
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:23,791
l have not given him permission
to die. He cannot die.

1063
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:16,082
Rehan!

1064
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:42,707
Quickly, call Grandpa. Go. Fast.

1065
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:45,124
Papa!
- Grandpa!

1066
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,541
Hand me the scissors, please.

1067
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,041
Who is this, mom?

1068
01:34:02,667 --> 01:34:05,874
Rehan, l don't know. Go,
please sit over there.

1069
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:13,249
ls he also dead like Grandma?

1070
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:15,291
Quiet! Little monkey

1071
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:20,041
His pulse is quite weak.

1072
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:21,874
Try the phone. ls it working now?

1073
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,416
No papa. lt's still dead.

1074
01:34:28,542 --> 01:34:32,332
We've done the best we could.
l'm no doctor.

1075
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,041
What can we do?

1076
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:37,457
You can't go and get a
doctor in this weather.

1077
01:34:37,542 --> 01:34:41,041
Not for 50 kilometers
in this storm. No way.

1078
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:44,041
Mom! Please leave Rehan.

1079
01:34:45,083 --> 01:34:46,874
Rehan!
- Mummy.

1080
01:34:47,417 --> 01:34:49,332
Nothing darling. Nothing

1081
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,041
Now it's up to you young man.

1082
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:59,374
We can only pray you
have some reason to live.

1083
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:06,416
lt can be two days?
lt can be two weeks?

1084
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:09,582
How can you not know
when the storm will pass?

1085
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,041
l want an update every hour,
you hear?

1086
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:15,124
can't you do anything right?

1087
01:35:18,375 --> 01:35:24,291
Till l don't see a body
l can't believe he's dead.

1088
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:39,457
Don't do that Rehan.
What are you up to?

1089
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:42,249
l can't hear his heartbeat.
There is no heartbeat.

1090
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:46,499
Rehan wants to hear his heartbeat,
like he hears Grandpa's.

1091
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:52,666
The heart is not here, it's there.

1092
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:34,624
Forgive me Zooni. l have no choice.

1093
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,749
Do you know the
cricketer Rahul Dravid?

1094
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:45,082
Rahul Dravid is Rehan's father.

1095
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:49,499
Because Rehan's
father is dead you see,

1096
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:53,166
..so mom said Rehan
could choose any father.

1097
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:56,249
So Rehan chose Rahul Dravid.

1098
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,874
Are you Mr.
Dependiddle like Rahul Dravid?

1099
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,499
can you also be completely
trusted like Rahul Dravid?

1100
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,499
That outhouse of
yours is falling apart.

1101
01:39:20,583 --> 01:39:24,374
Look, look the dead man is awake.

1102
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,082
Don't talk like that.

1103
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:31,666
When the weather is better we'll
get it fixed. lt's freezing. - Yes.

1104
01:39:37,042 --> 01:39:41,166
Before you thank me.
come and eat something.

1105
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:13,124
Don't drink so much
you'll become a hittototomas.

1106
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:19,041
Not hittototomas, kid. Hippopotomas.

1107
01:40:19,292 --> 01:40:21,416
And where did you learn this word?

1108
01:40:21,833 --> 01:40:25,207
From colonel uncle. Hitto.
Hittototomas.

1109
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:27,499
Hippopotamus.

1110
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:34,457
Would you like something?
l'm sorry l didn't get your name.

1111
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:36,291
captain Ranjeev!

1112
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:39,332
lndian Army.

1113
01:40:40,792 --> 01:40:43,624
l didn't know there were
military operations here.

1114
01:40:44,125 --> 01:40:47,999
There are such few of us here.
What will the militants do here?

1115
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:50,874
They can hide.

1116
01:40:51,542 --> 01:40:52,624
Rehan.

1117
01:40:55,083 --> 01:41:00,166
The dead man stinks so
Rehan thought.. - Rehan.

1118
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:02,707
So sorry.

1119
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:08,749
Strange, when Zooni couldn't
see she didn't bang into a thing.

1120
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:14,499
And now that she can see, she's
constantly walking into things.

1121
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:19,499
Thank you for saving me.

1122
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:24,666
You were lucky, so you survived.
What did l do?

1123
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:32,999
ls it just the 3 of you here?

1124
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:40,624
Zooni's mother died a
couple of years ago.

1125
01:41:41,917 --> 01:41:43,707
And left me all alone.

1126
01:41:45,167 --> 01:41:50,707
And before that her
husband died in a bomb blast.

1127
01:41:52,042 --> 01:41:56,416
l don't know why, but Zooni
blames herself for his death.

1128
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:09,791
When will this storm end?
l must leave from here.

1129
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:15,041
lt's hard to say. lt might
stop tomorrow or maybe a week.

1130
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:19,416
Don't think of leaving
in this weather though.

1131
01:42:20,792 --> 01:42:24,082
certainly not in your state.

1132
01:42:24,958 --> 01:42:29,082
Rest a while. You are our guest.

1133
01:42:30,792 --> 01:42:33,791
captain Ranjeev..

1134
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:58,707
cheers.

1135
01:42:58,792 --> 01:43:01,207
Dispenser of lndia's destiny.

1136
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,124
You keep teaching me things.

1137
01:43:04,208 --> 01:43:06,707
So boring. Tell Rehan a story.

1138
01:43:06,792 --> 01:43:08,957
..Dispenser of lndia's destiny

1139
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:12,374
You're not a good mother.
You never tell Rehan stories.

1140
01:43:12,458 --> 01:43:14,749
l don't know any stories.
- Bad mummy.

1141
01:43:14,833 --> 01:43:16,749
Not me. You. You're a bad boy.

1142
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:18,541
Go. l'm not talking to you.

1143
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:28,874
Rehan loves you more
than you love Rehan.

1144
01:43:32,292 --> 01:43:36,457
But mom Rehan already
knows the national anthem.

1145
01:43:36,542 --> 01:43:37,624
Let's hear it.

1146
01:43:37,708 --> 01:43:40,041
Thou art the ruler of the
minds of all the people.. Dravid,

1147
01:43:40,083 --> 01:43:43,124
..Orissa and Bengal.
Dravid, Orissa and Bengal.

1148
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:44,957
You and your Dravid fixation.

1149
01:43:45,042 --> 01:43:47,082
Dravid, Orissa and Bengal.

1150
01:43:48,958 --> 01:43:51,166
Do you know the national anthem?

1151
01:43:52,875 --> 01:43:53,999
No.

1152
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:58,749
See even the dead man
doesn't know the national anthem.

1153
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:01,457
Please tell mom,
not to teach Rehan.

1154
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:05,166
The phone's dead.
Tell her not to teach Rehan.

1155
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:10,791
What's this?

1156
01:44:10,875 --> 01:44:12,707
Which soldier doesn't
know the national anthem?

1157
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,124
Why are you lying to the child?

1158
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:16,082
l am not here to teach
him the national anthem,

1159
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:17,832
..and l'm not here
to play with him.

1160
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,582
l don't care if l lied to him..

1161
01:44:19,667 --> 01:44:21,957
..l'm a soldier on a
mission not his father!

1162
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:28,874
come here immediately!

1163
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,082
Why, grandpa.

1164
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:10,832
lf you don't eat vegetables
how will you slay the dragon?

1165
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:13,207
So, you must have it.

1166
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,249
captain Ranjeev, come and join us.

1167
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:20,416
Tell us about your life.

1168
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:24,041
l've heard soldiers have
fascinating stories to tell.

1169
01:45:24,667 --> 01:45:28,624
l'm not hungry thank you.
l'll just go to bed.

1170
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:31,749
Your bed has been made upstairs.
The room on the left.

1171
01:45:44,667 --> 01:45:46,457
Dead man made mom cry.

1172
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:50,874
Eat your food.

1173
01:46:05,333 --> 01:46:06,416
What's this?

1174
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:08,416
Mom has sent it for you.

1175
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:11,624
So you'll get better
faster so you can leave faster.

1176
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:14,541
But what is it?

1177
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:15,791
Poison.

1178
01:46:16,083 --> 01:46:17,624
Milk with turmeric.

1179
01:46:17,708 --> 01:46:21,124
And don't try and throw it
in the Wc, it stinks it up..

1180
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,749
..and mom finds out.

1181
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:26,082
Don't throw it out either,
the snow gets yellow.

1182
01:46:26,167 --> 01:46:30,124
And in the wash basin the color
stains it, you'll get caught.

1183
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:38,666
And yes! lf you find
some other way.

1184
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:41,166
Please, tell Rehan.
Next time Rehan will do the same.

1185
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:43,374
Okay? Goodnight.

1186
01:47:00,583 --> 01:47:02,166
lt really is poison.

1187
01:47:08,667 --> 01:47:18,707
"come closer now, l will not
come back again and again"

1188
01:47:19,458 --> 01:47:29,249
"Put your arms around me,
so l can cry again and again"

1189
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:34,499
"Love from your eyes.."

1190
01:47:34,583 --> 01:47:38,332
'lf only l was a roll of wool..
..wrapped around her fingers..'

1191
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:41,207
"Think we will never meet again.."

1192
01:47:41,292 --> 01:47:50,332
"..just suppose, not till
this lifetime is forever closed"

1193
01:47:52,417 --> 01:47:57,374
"come into my arms, hold me close.."

1194
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:02,791
"..we may never again
have the night's repose."

1195
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:07,499
"Think we'll never meet again,
just suppose.."

1196
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:13,791
"..not till this
lifetime is forever closed."

1197
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:18,374
"Think we will never meet again.."

1198
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:21,582
"..just suppose, not till
this lifetime is forever closed"

1199
01:48:21,667 --> 01:48:34,082
"O Almighty."

1200
01:49:00,083 --> 01:49:01,416
Thank you.

1201
01:49:55,958 --> 01:49:57,291
l am sorry.

1202
01:49:57,625 --> 01:49:59,832
Yesterday l was very rude.

1203
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:06,707
Actually, l'm not
very good with children.

1204
01:50:11,792 --> 01:50:13,832
Am not very good with words either.

1205
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:18,624
But l am good with a hammer.

1206
01:50:18,792 --> 01:50:20,082
Give it to me.

1207
01:50:22,542 --> 01:50:24,749
Not everything can be done alone.

1208
01:50:33,292 --> 01:50:36,166
Rehan doesn't have a father..

1209
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:41,499
..so he sometimes..
he won't trouble you again.

1210
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:44,666
lts okay.

1211
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:47,124
He's a good kid.

1212
01:50:53,458 --> 01:50:55,916
So have you forgiven me then?

1213
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:05,707
Thing is, l spend
so much time alone..

1214
01:51:06,625 --> 01:51:09,207
..that l don't know how to
behave in company any more.

1215
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:11,541
Like this one time l went to..

1216
01:51:11,625 --> 01:51:14,041
..my friend Mihir Wohra's
house for a party.

1217
01:51:14,583 --> 01:51:16,957
l asked his wife how she
likes being wife number 2.

1218
01:51:17,542 --> 01:51:19,582
Turns out she was wife number 1 ..

1219
01:51:19,792 --> 01:51:21,749
..and had no idea
there was a wife number 2.

1220
01:51:26,542 --> 01:51:30,957
After this l decided l
would stick to safe topics.

1221
01:51:31,583 --> 01:51:35,707
So l asked my colonel how
his son was doing at school?

1222
01:51:35,958 --> 01:51:37,541
Now that's safe? Right?

1223
01:51:37,917 --> 01:51:42,207
Wrong. Just that day his son
had been thrown out of school..

1224
01:51:42,292 --> 01:51:44,499
..for biting his teacher's bum.

1225
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:49,957
And not just that.
He was sent back to apologise the..

1226
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,957
..following day and he ended up
biting her other bum.

1227
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:00,416
close your eyes.

1228
01:52:23,542 --> 01:52:26,291
Rehan doesn't want to wash his hair.

1229
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:30,541
You have to wash your hair or you'll
get such big, big insects in it.

1230
01:52:30,625 --> 01:52:33,499
Let them come Rehan will take
the insects for a walk every day.

1231
01:52:33,583 --> 01:52:36,291
Rehan doesn't want to wash his hair.
- May l help?

1232
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:38,749
Give it a try.

1233
01:52:39,208 --> 01:52:41,582
l'm not talking to
you l'm talking to him.

1234
01:52:41,667 --> 01:52:46,416
Dead man is on my side!

1235
01:52:46,917 --> 01:52:51,207
He's such a sweet kid.
Why are you bothering him.

1236
01:52:52,542 --> 01:52:54,332
But he has to wash his hair.

1237
01:52:54,417 --> 01:52:56,791
He'll wash it
when he feels like it.

1238
01:52:58,792 --> 01:53:00,416
cheater!?

1239
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:08,624
Dead man is a cheater!

1240
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:10,749
Rehan! Look up.

1241
01:53:12,167 --> 01:53:15,666
You were right.
Everything can't be done alone.

1242
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:19,666
come on, Rehan.

1243
01:53:28,167 --> 01:53:29,999
Dead man is funny.

1244
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:31,582
Don't call him dead man, son.

1245
01:53:31,667 --> 01:53:33,749
Rehan likes the dead man.

1246
01:53:47,708 --> 01:53:49,666
can l help you?

1247
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:52,791
l'm fine. Thanks.

1248
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:01,541
Everything can't be done alone.

1249
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:09,291
You told us
some good stories today.

1250
01:54:14,042 --> 01:54:16,124
Why have you stopped
telling stories?

1251
01:54:18,125 --> 01:54:21,249
Your father talks a lot
after a couple of drinks.

1252
01:54:24,792 --> 01:54:26,916
Earlier l couldn't see.

1253
01:54:28,542 --> 01:54:33,332
Now l've seen too much
to believe in stories.

1254
01:54:36,583 --> 01:54:38,707
Your family must be worried.

1255
01:54:38,875 --> 01:54:40,999
You've been missing for a few days.

1256
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:44,582
l have no family,
l never met my parents.

1257
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:47,666
They died when l was 3.

1258
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:51,832
l'm sorry you're so lonely.

1259
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:55,791
Not at all. Why do you say that?

1260
01:54:57,875 --> 01:55:00,499
Your smile doesn't
reach your eyes.

1261
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,041
A soldier's life is like that.

1262
01:55:11,292 --> 01:55:15,124
There must be someone else
hidden behind that soldier

1263
01:55:18,042 --> 01:55:19,666
Perhaps.

1264
01:55:20,833 --> 01:55:23,957
But, l don't think
l really understand him.

1265
01:55:25,833 --> 01:55:28,541
Sometimes to understand
yourself..

1266
01:55:29,083 --> 01:55:32,332
..you need to see yourself
from someone else's eyes.

1267
01:55:34,167 --> 01:55:38,207
l could never get
that close to anyone.

1268
01:55:42,542 --> 01:55:46,082
Why? You couldn't trust anyone?

1269
01:55:48,333 --> 01:55:49,916
l don't trust myself.

1270
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:54,957
And then everytime,
a new mission, a new city.

1271
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,749
l couldn't be in any
one place for too long

1272
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:06,624
Sometimes you seem very familiar.

1273
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:52,124


1274
01:56:58,208 --> 01:57:02,416
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief"

1275
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:06,624
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1276
01:57:10,875 --> 01:57:14,999
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief."

1277
01:57:15,083 --> 01:57:18,707
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1278
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:23,374
"A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure."

1279
01:57:23,458 --> 01:57:27,791
"Moon blooms sugar sucking
creams the thieving thief."

1280
01:57:27,875 --> 01:57:31,832
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief."

1281
01:57:31,917 --> 01:57:36,082
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1282
01:57:53,042 --> 01:57:55,082
"Surly Khadak Singh simmers and
stutter sputter go the shutters."

1283
01:57:55,167 --> 01:57:57,582
"Stutter sputter go the shutters
making surly Khadak Singh simmer."

1284
01:57:59,333 --> 01:58:03,457
"Surely Khadak Singh simmers and
stutter sputter go the shutters."

1285
01:58:03,542 --> 01:58:08,082
"Stutter sputter go the shutters
making surly Khadak Singh simmer."

1286
01:58:08,292 --> 01:58:12,874
"A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure."

1287
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:15,124
"Stutter sputter go the shutters."

1288
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,207
"Surely Khadak Singh simmers more."

1289
01:58:17,292 --> 01:58:21,291
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief."

1290
01:58:21,375 --> 01:58:25,457
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1291
01:58:25,542 --> 01:58:29,749
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief."

1292
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:34,041
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
illy sugar sucking ant for sure."

1293
01:58:59,375 --> 01:59:00,707
"Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree."

1294
01:59:00,792 --> 01:59:02,041
"Tree ripe or ripe Papaya?"

1295
01:59:02,083 --> 01:59:03,582
"The ripe tree Pinkoo picks."

1296
01:59:03,667 --> 01:59:04,999
"Pinkoo picks the ripe Papaya."

1297
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:06,207
"Say it."

1298
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:11,082
"Ripe Papaya upon the ripe
tree picks 'Pinkoo ripe kapda'."

1299
01:59:11,125 --> 01:59:12,332
"Kapda? cloth?"

1300
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:19,332
"Ripe Papaya upon the ripe tree,
pick on tree or Papaya ripe?"

1301
01:59:19,417 --> 01:59:24,041
"Pinkoo picks the ripe tree,
pinkoo picks the Papaya ripe."

1302
01:59:24,083 --> 01:59:28,707
"A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure."

1303
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:32,791
"Pinkoo picks the ripe tree
Pinkoo picks the Papaya ripe."

1304
01:59:32,875 --> 01:59:37,082
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
of fright freaks the thieving thief."

1305
01:59:37,167 --> 01:59:41,249
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1306
01:59:41,333 --> 01:59:45,541
"The moon booms, blooms, balloons,
if fright freaks the thieving thief."

1307
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:49,249
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1308
01:59:49,333 --> 01:59:53,999
"A difficult song this is,
can you sing it for me pure."

1309
01:59:54,083 --> 01:59:58,249
"The moon booms blooms, balloons
of fright freaks the thieving thief.

1310
01:59:58,333 --> 02:00:02,332

1311
02:00:02,417 --> 02:00:06,749
"The silly ant sucks sugar,
silly sugar sucking ant for sure."

1312
02:00:23,458 --> 02:00:25,957
Rehan will not call
him dead man any more.

1313
02:00:26,042 --> 02:00:27,582
You're my good son.

1314
02:00:28,042 --> 02:00:34,374
can Rehan call dead man, papa?
Please?

1315
02:00:37,083 --> 02:00:38,249
close your eyes.

1316
02:00:47,875 --> 02:00:55,749
So tell me captain Ranjeev,
have you ever loved..

1317
02:00:56,458 --> 02:01:00,957
..a woman so deeply that
her smile made you breathless?

1318
02:01:02,167 --> 02:01:03,416
l..

1319
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:06,957
l loved my Nafisa like that.
She was..

1320
02:01:08,208 --> 02:01:10,957
Heavenly!
- Papa, you've started again.

1321
02:01:11,042 --> 02:01:14,124
l've told you not to drink
in front of mama's photograph.

1322
02:01:16,042 --> 02:01:19,916
Let me sit and drink
on the Mosque ground..

1323
02:01:20,333 --> 02:01:23,832
..or show me a place
where God is not found"

1324
02:01:24,042 --> 02:01:26,207
Fantastic! Superb!

1325
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:34,541
ln this life without
you l have no..

1326
02:01:34,625 --> 02:01:36,791
complaint."

1327
02:01:36,958 --> 02:01:43,749
No complaint, l have no complaint.

1328
02:01:46,458 --> 02:01:49,332
Enough papa, enough.

1329
02:01:50,083 --> 02:01:52,249
What are you doing?
We're having such a nice time.

1330
02:01:52,333 --> 02:01:53,666
Let's go, papa.

1331
02:01:53,750 --> 02:01:57,041
Let me finish this drink.

1332
02:01:57,167 --> 02:02:04,166
"ln this life without
you l have no complaint.

1333
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:18,874
But this life without
you is no life anyway.."

1334
02:02:19,292 --> 02:02:27,999
l wish l could bury my head in
your veil and cry, just cry.."

1335
02:02:36,417 --> 02:02:42,124
Are you sure your eyes
themselves don't lack in tears..

1336
02:02:42,208 --> 02:02:43,791
..are dry, just dry?"

1337
02:02:46,083 --> 02:02:47,291
The letter 'H'

1338
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:58,749
How do you do, dear one?
How do you think, dear one?

1339
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:02,832
l'm just happy oh ho ho.

1340
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:06,249
So, you've slipped then aa ha ha."

1341
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:16,082
What if l let my
heart live in your eyes?

1342
02:03:16,458 --> 02:03:22,624
What if l close my eyes,
and punish your heart?"

1343
02:03:23,125 --> 02:03:30,249
What can l say in praise
of the one who made you?"

1344
02:03:32,458 --> 02:03:39,541
These nights, this clime,
this river side, this playful breeze"

1345
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:45,416
Time has given us
such beautiful pain.

1346
02:03:45,708 --> 02:03:53,541
..l am not me anymore
and you are not the same.

1347
02:03:56,792 --> 02:04:02,082
Our hearts tremble
now as they meet.

1348
02:04:02,792 --> 02:04:08,832
Like they were never
apart for even a beat.

1349
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:18,082
But you got lost and so did l.

1350
02:04:19,583 --> 02:04:21,999
After our travel together..

1351
02:04:45,083 --> 02:04:46,624
Now you're scared.

1352
02:04:49,375 --> 02:04:51,249
Who are you?

1353
02:04:54,333 --> 02:04:56,541
How do you know all this?

1354
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:01,666
You can't know.

1355
02:05:04,583 --> 02:05:06,791
What's happening to me?

1356
02:05:09,083 --> 02:05:15,582
l hear him in your voice,
your breath, it's all the same.

1357
02:05:19,792 --> 02:05:21,082
Zooni.

1358
02:05:29,583 --> 02:05:32,582
lt's me. Rehan.

1359
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:43,374
Your Rehan.

1360
02:05:56,875 --> 02:06:01,624
What l did to you.
l've never forgiven myself for it.

1361
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:08,541
l promised myself
l'd stay away from you.

1362
02:06:11,125 --> 02:06:13,749
l didn't want to cause
you more pain.

1363
02:06:19,125 --> 02:06:24,874
Perhaps it was God's justice
that l had to die at your doorstep.

1364
02:06:27,083 --> 02:06:29,999
But you kept me alive.

1365
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:36,499
And now l want to live.

1366
02:06:37,625 --> 02:06:42,541
l want to live for you,
for our son.

1367
02:06:47,167 --> 02:06:51,707
Rehan.. You are Rehan?

1368
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:01,166
My real name is Rehan Qadri.

1369
02:07:02,167 --> 02:07:03,832
Kashmiri?

1370
02:07:04,833 --> 02:07:07,291
Yes.
- Go on.

1371
02:07:08,958 --> 02:07:11,582
When l met Zooni
l was on a mission.

1372
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,666
And that's why you fell
in love with my daughter?

1373
02:07:14,958 --> 02:07:16,874
Promised her marriage?

1374
02:07:16,958 --> 02:07:18,832
Was that all a part of
your mission?

1375
02:07:19,958 --> 02:07:22,082
That was my weakness.

1376
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,916
l was not free to love.

1377
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:31,374
l am deeply sorry and
ashamed about my selfish love.

1378
02:07:31,917 --> 02:07:35,624
And you've come back
to repeat that mistake?

1379
02:07:37,625 --> 02:07:41,707
My mission is not complete yet.
After this storm, it will be.

1380
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,124
Then l will stay with
Zooni for the rest of my life.

1381
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:48,749
Mission! Mission! What
is this great mission..

1382
02:07:48,833 --> 02:07:52,166
Because of which you're
playing with all our lives?

1383
02:07:52,708 --> 02:07:54,666
l can't say.
- What?

1384
02:07:56,583 --> 02:07:59,707
l know my silence
can go against me.

1385
02:08:00,542 --> 02:08:04,457
But l do not want to lie and
l cannot tell you the truth.

1386
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,582
All l can say in my
defence is that my love is true.

1387
02:08:18,125 --> 02:08:20,124
l have given you a lot of pain..

1388
02:08:20,208 --> 02:08:23,291
..still l am asking
you to fill my wounds.

1389
02:08:25,042 --> 02:08:27,832
l know l'm not worthy
of your forgiveness..

1390
02:08:29,167 --> 02:08:36,874
..but l stand before you with
the hope that you will forgive me.

1391
02:08:48,833 --> 02:08:52,082
l would not have left
my Nafisa for anything.

1392
02:08:53,292 --> 02:08:56,874
God came in the way otherwise
l would've still been with her.

1393
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:04,082
There is no reason to believe him,
but there is also no reason not to.

1394
02:09:05,167 --> 02:09:09,582
lt was your decision then
Zooni and it's your decision now.

1395
02:09:36,333 --> 02:09:37,916
7 years!

1396
02:09:39,375 --> 02:09:44,832
7 years l have lived with the guilt
that l sent you to your death.

1397
02:09:47,833 --> 02:09:53,666
Every day l curse my
self for sending you there.

1398
02:09:56,250 --> 02:09:59,207
Do you know what it's
like to live with that?

1399
02:10:05,375 --> 02:10:06,666
Look at this!

1400
02:10:08,792 --> 02:10:11,499
When you were off
being a great soldier ..

1401
02:10:12,083 --> 02:10:14,457
..on your missions
this is what l was doing.

1402
02:10:16,167 --> 02:10:19,124
l was taking parts of all these
faces, trying to make one face.

1403
02:10:19,208 --> 02:10:20,666
Your face.

1404
02:10:21,583 --> 02:10:26,082
So l could have something to cry in
front of, something to show my son.

1405
02:10:27,375 --> 02:10:30,541
To tell him this is your father.

1406
02:10:31,792 --> 02:10:39,999
And now you say all those tears,
all that pain was for nothing?

1407
02:10:42,208 --> 02:10:43,457
No!

1408
02:10:46,042 --> 02:10:47,707
Why should l open myself
to pain again Rehan?

1409
02:10:47,792 --> 02:10:49,374
Why should l take you back?

1410
02:10:52,083 --> 02:10:55,416
Give me one good reason..

1411
02:10:57,083 --> 02:11:01,416
..why l shouldn't
believe you are still dead.

1412
02:11:03,917 --> 02:11:05,624
Give me one good reason.

1413
02:11:12,167 --> 02:11:16,291
l don't have a single good reason.

1414
02:11:19,083 --> 02:11:21,791
They are all bad.

1415
02:11:23,417 --> 02:11:25,624
Each and every one.

1416
02:12:00,583 --> 02:12:04,457
l was taking parts of all these
faces, trying to make one face.

1417
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:35,582
Why are you going?

1418
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:50,541
Because l can't play
cricket like Rahul Dra?id.

1419
02:12:50,625 --> 02:12:54,582
Don't worry. Rehan will teach you.

1420
02:12:58,417 --> 02:13:03,291
l am not dependiddle either.
l can't be trusted.

1421
02:13:03,458 --> 02:13:06,666
No you are dependable for Rehan.

1422
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:10,166
See Rehan has learned
how to say dependable.

1423
02:13:10,542 --> 02:13:14,166
Rehan will never trouble you again.

1424
02:13:14,667 --> 02:13:18,791
He won't call you dead man.
He will have a bath himself.

1425
02:13:18,875 --> 02:13:23,582
He will not give you milk and
turmeric, but please don't go.

1426
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:41,291
Rehan loves you more
than you love Rehan.

1427
02:14:10,042 --> 02:14:11,124
Sit properly!

1428
02:14:13,292 --> 02:14:14,499
Eat!

1429
02:14:14,583 --> 02:14:16,582
Why are you venting
your anger on him?

1430
02:14:17,875 --> 02:14:21,666
The one who deserves it has
left without saying a word.

1431
02:14:23,875 --> 02:14:27,749
He must be in his room.
Go tell him breakfast is ready.

1432
02:14:27,833 --> 02:14:30,207
l'm not going to stand around
in the kitchen all day for him.

1433
02:14:30,417 --> 02:14:33,666
He's gone. He said
goodbye to Rehan. Not to you.

1434
02:14:42,292 --> 02:14:46,374
No, he can't go.

1435
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:50,207
He can't go.

1436
02:15:03,042 --> 02:15:04,707
Rehan!

1437
02:15:08,375 --> 02:15:11,582
Stop! Rehan!

1438
02:15:12,417 --> 02:15:15,291
Rehan!

1439
02:15:20,167 --> 02:15:22,332
How dare you leave me again?
How dare you?

1440
02:15:22,417 --> 02:15:24,874
Your life is mine now, do you hear?

1441
02:15:24,958 --> 02:15:30,832
You can never leave me and go.
Never!

1442
02:15:30,917 --> 02:15:43,207
"O Almighty."

1443
02:15:44,208 --> 02:15:54,207


1444
02:16:00,625 --> 02:16:01,707
Papa!

1445
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:06,499
"When l have your hands in mine."

1446
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:11,832
"l have with me the heavens divine."

1447
02:16:11,917 --> 02:16:16,624
"When l have your hands in mine."

1448
02:16:16,958 --> 02:16:21,874
"l have with me the heavens divine."

1449
02:16:22,083 --> 02:16:27,041
"When you're close,
this world is naught."

1450
02:16:27,250 --> 02:16:32,082
"Destroyed in your love,
a triumph sought."

1451
02:16:32,292 --> 02:16:37,082
"When l have your hands in mine."

1452
02:16:37,333 --> 02:16:42,291
"l have with me
the heavens di?ine."

1453
02:16:42,542 --> 02:16:47,457
"When you're close
this world is naught."

1454
02:16:47,667 --> 02:16:52,166
"Destroyed in your love,
a triumph sought."

1455
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:57,582
"When l have your hands in mine."

1456
02:16:57,792 --> 02:17:02,916
"l have with me
the heavens di?ine."

1457
02:17:25,667 --> 02:17:28,624
May my life's-breath
find refuge in your heart.

1458
02:17:29,667 --> 02:17:32,999
Destroyed in your
love may my life depart.

1459
02:17:33,583 --> 02:17:38,499
"As close as
fragrances are to breath."

1460
02:17:38,667 --> 02:17:43,166
"As close as songs are to lips."

1461
02:17:43,792 --> 02:17:48,582
"As close as sleepless
nights to memories."

1462
02:17:48,875 --> 02:17:53,082
"As close as arms are to embraces."

1463
02:17:53,958 --> 02:17:58,749
"As close, as close
as dreams to eyes."

1464
02:17:59,083 --> 02:18:03,374
"Be that close to me,
oh love of mine."

1465
02:18:04,208 --> 02:18:08,874
"When you're close
this world is naught."

1466
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:13,916
"Destroyed in your love,
a triumph sought."

1467
02:18:14,458 --> 02:18:19,041
"When l have your hands in mine."

1468
02:18:19,417 --> 02:18:24,416
"l have with me the heavens divine."

1469
02:18:45,917 --> 02:18:50,291
Let my eyes swell with tears,
let me cry today.

1470
02:18:51,083 --> 02:18:54,332
Take me in your arms,
get drenched today.

1471
02:18:55,458 --> 02:19:00,166
The sea of pain trapped
in my heart will explode.

1472
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:05,166
l have so much pain your
veil will be drenched.

1473
02:19:05,375 --> 02:19:10,582
As close as secrets
are to heartbeats.

1474
02:19:10,667 --> 02:19:15,374
As close as
raindrops are to the clouds.

1475
02:19:15,625 --> 02:19:20,416
As close as the moon
is to the night.

1476
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:25,124
As close as kohl is to the eyes.

1477
02:19:25,875 --> 02:19:30,874
As close, as close as
the waves are to the ocean.

1478
02:19:31,083 --> 02:19:35,791
"Be that close to me,
oh love of mine."

1479
02:19:36,083 --> 02:19:40,957
"When you're close
this world is naught."

1480
02:19:41,167 --> 02:19:45,957
"Destroyed in your love,
a triumph sought."

1481
02:19:46,250 --> 02:19:51,207
"When l have your hands in mine."

1482
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:56,374
"l have with me the
heavens divine."

1483
02:19:57,125 --> 02:20:02,999
My breath was incomplete, heartbeat
incomplete, incomplete was l .

1484
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:06,832
But now the moon is full,
complete in the sky..

1485
02:20:06,917 --> 02:20:08,874
..and now with you complete am l..

1486
02:20:31,167 --> 02:20:34,166
Give us some good news Aakash.
can we go any further?

1487
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:36,582
Sorry ma'am, we'll have to
wait another 2 or 3 days.

1488
02:20:36,792 --> 02:20:40,999
But we have to do something Aakash.
We can't just stand around.

1489
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:47,749
No. Not the press. We can't talk
to the media about the bomb yet.

1490
02:20:47,958 --> 02:20:50,082
The order's come
directly from Delhi.

1491
02:20:50,167 --> 02:20:54,624
We can't talk about the bomb
but we can talk about him.

1492
02:20:55,083 --> 02:21:00,874
Aakash! lnform the press.
Newspaper, Radio, TV.

1493
02:21:01,125 --> 02:21:04,124
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

1494
02:21:04,208 --> 02:21:08,332
This terrorist is badly wounded
and is wearing an army uniform.

1495
02:21:08,417 --> 02:21:10,666
He is also carrying
an electronic part.

1496
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:15,457
lf you have any information
on this man please..

1497
02:21:15,542 --> 02:21:19,541
..contact your nearest
police station immediately.

1498
02:21:23,292 --> 02:21:24,999
come on Rehan, drink your milk.

1499
02:21:27,083 --> 02:21:31,374
Rehan loves you more
than you love Rehan.

1500
02:21:31,583 --> 02:21:37,624
No, l love Rehan much more than
that and he has to drink this milk.

1501
02:21:37,792 --> 02:21:39,291
And what about this Rehan?

1502
02:21:44,625 --> 02:21:45,832
At this time?

1503
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:53,582
colonel? At this time?
What's the matter?

1504
02:21:53,667 --> 02:21:57,166
l have risked life and come
here for a very important reason.

1505
02:21:57,250 --> 02:21:59,166
What? come inside.

1506
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:02,707
l've run out of rum!

1507
02:22:04,083 --> 02:22:06,707
The games destiny plays with us.

1508
02:22:07,417 --> 02:22:09,749
And if one is in the army their..

1509
02:22:10,083 --> 02:22:13,082
..destiny is not in
their hands anyway. cheers!

1510
02:22:17,458 --> 02:22:22,707
Rehan, if you like you can come
to my house and radio your unit.

1511
02:22:22,792 --> 02:22:24,832
You have a radio transmitter?

1512
02:22:24,917 --> 02:22:28,041
Meet the man who lives
in the middle of nowhere..

1513
02:22:28,083 --> 02:22:30,707
..and keeps a radio to
keep in touch with people.

1514
02:22:30,792 --> 02:22:34,249
Always wonder
why he lives out here.

1515
02:22:34,958 --> 02:22:38,082
lt's late today. lt'll be
dark by the time you return.

1516
02:22:38,125 --> 02:22:39,207
lt's dark already.

1517
02:22:39,292 --> 02:22:41,166
Ok, so it's night already.
come tomorrow.

1518
02:22:41,333 --> 02:22:44,541
The weather should be clearer as
well. come and radio your unit then.

1519
02:22:44,708 --> 02:22:47,249
There's no need for that.
- Why not?

1520
02:22:47,333 --> 02:22:48,499
He has just returned after 7 years.

1521
02:22:48,583 --> 02:22:50,374
l don't want him to
disappear for another 7.

1522
02:22:50,708 --> 02:22:53,374
You are trying to guard
a soldier is it?

1523
02:22:53,458 --> 02:22:55,374
Rehan, do you want me
to radio them?

1524
02:22:56,208 --> 02:22:58,124
No, l'll have to do it myself.

1525
02:22:58,375 --> 02:23:00,416
Of course, of course.

1526
02:23:00,625 --> 02:23:02,916
Let him give his
status report then you..

1527
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,207
..can keep him imprisoned
here forever, right Rehan?

1528
02:23:06,292 --> 02:23:08,999
Fine, now no more discussion.
What do they say in Punjabi?

1529
02:23:09,083 --> 02:23:11,166
Let's have a whopper of a drink.

1530
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,499
cheers, pal.
- Excuse me.

1531
02:23:46,042 --> 02:23:50,457
Where's your father? He was
to take me to colonels' house.

1532
02:23:52,917 --> 02:23:54,582
Do you really have to go?

1533
02:23:56,958 --> 02:23:58,416
Just this last bit of work.

1534
02:24:00,875 --> 02:24:05,332
Papa takes a while to get ready.
He'll be down soon. Papa!

1535
02:24:05,417 --> 02:24:06,666
Rehan!

1536
02:24:17,583 --> 02:24:21,582
Once upon a time there was a prince,
and a princess who was blind.

1537
02:24:21,792 --> 02:24:24,082
Mom, you are telling a story?

1538
02:24:26,167 --> 02:24:29,082
One day the princess
met an ordinary man who..

1539
02:24:29,125 --> 02:24:32,791
..followed different
monuments in different cities.

1540
02:24:34,042 --> 02:24:38,041
But the princess saw the
prince hidden in that ordinary man.

1541
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,082
What was the prince's name?

1542
02:24:41,542 --> 02:24:42,666
Rehan.

1543
02:24:52,292 --> 02:24:56,666
The prince saved the
princess from a huge, scary dragon.

1544
02:24:57,208 --> 02:25:02,416
The dragon had a big, red face.
Every time he opened his mouth..

1545
02:25:02,583 --> 02:25:04,999
..gigantic balls of
fire would come out of it.

1546
02:25:05,083 --> 02:25:07,166
What was the dragon's name?

1547
02:25:09,042 --> 02:25:10,457
Grandpa!

1548
02:25:12,667 --> 02:25:18,082
come on Rehan, let's go to the
colonel's and radio your unit.

1549
02:25:18,875 --> 02:25:21,374
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

1550
02:25:21,458 --> 02:25:23,999
This terrorist is
wearing an army uniform.

1551
02:25:24,083 --> 02:25:26,207
He is also carrying
an electronic part.

1552
02:25:26,375 --> 02:25:28,416
Grandpa..

1553
02:25:31,958 --> 02:25:35,332
Grandpa, Rehan loves you very much.

1554
02:25:50,083 --> 02:25:53,457
l will have to go for a couple
of days to hand in my resignation.

1555
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,457
Whether or not you're
on this mission..

1556
02:25:57,542 --> 02:25:59,457
..the lKF will definitely loose.

1557
02:26:00,167 --> 02:26:02,249
Terrorists can never win.

1558
02:26:03,083 --> 02:26:05,082
That's the thing.
These people are not terrorists.

1559
02:26:05,417 --> 02:26:07,082
They are fighting
for their independence.

1560
02:26:07,875 --> 02:26:10,624
And who will run this
country of theirs? The lKF?

1561
02:26:11,083 --> 02:26:15,541
No. Whoever the people of
Kashmir elect. ln fair elections.

1562
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:21,082
lt seems youre not
against the lKF, youre for them.

1563
02:26:46,083 --> 02:26:49,582
You are a traitor. You may
be my daughter's husband,

1564
02:26:50,125 --> 02:26:52,416
..but l'll gladly kill you.

1565
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,666
l was doubtful when l saw the news on
the Tv, but by then it was too late.

1566
02:26:59,750 --> 02:27:03,499
l had my doubts.
But today l was certain..

1567
02:27:03,875 --> 02:27:08,166
..when l found this
trigger in your pocket.

1568
02:27:10,375 --> 02:27:12,999
You can't do anything now.

1569
02:27:13,083 --> 02:27:15,874
l am going to radio the
military and hand you over.

1570
02:27:16,208 --> 02:27:19,624
colonel! colonel!

1571
02:27:21,167 --> 02:27:23,124
Please Sir, give me that trigger.

1572
02:27:23,208 --> 02:27:25,416
No! - All this will be
over in a couple of days.

1573
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:27,707
Then l can stay with
Zooni and Rehan forever.

1574
02:27:27,792 --> 02:27:30,916
l'd rather they be dead.
l'll never give you this. Never.

1575
02:27:32,958 --> 02:27:34,582
No! l wont give you!

1576
02:27:42,542 --> 02:27:44,957
Don't you dare, Rehan!

1577
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:57,916
No!!

1578
02:28:06,333 --> 02:28:14,707
Shalimar 1 Shikara come in.

1579
02:28:14,875 --> 02:28:19,874
Hello, Shalimar 1 we read you.
- Shalimar 1 Shikara come in.

1580
02:28:21,125 --> 02:28:27,624
My son. Rehan! God be praised
a million times. You're alive!

1581
02:28:28,667 --> 02:28:31,041
Do you have what l want?

1582
02:28:32,542 --> 02:28:34,374
Yes, l have it with me.

1583
02:28:34,458 --> 02:28:35,957
What's the matter?

1584
02:28:36,042 --> 02:28:40,791
l'm tired that's all.
l just want all this to end.

1585
02:28:41,083 --> 02:28:43,332
Look here..
- l know what l have to do.

1586
02:28:44,167 --> 02:28:46,541
come here and take
what it is you want.

1587
02:28:47,667 --> 02:28:53,082
The coordinates here
are loc rep 34,74,..

1588
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:57,457
..mount 2730, 500 house.

1589
02:28:59,125 --> 02:29:03,541
That was him. Thank God he
hasn't reached his people yet.

1590
02:29:03,625 --> 02:29:06,832
There is very heavy fog
right now. We'll try and be..

1591
02:29:07,458 --> 02:29:12,041
..there tomorrow morning.
God be with you.

1592
02:29:23,542 --> 02:29:25,541
Sorry ma'am he gave his
location in code.

1593
02:29:25,625 --> 02:29:28,041
We'll need some time to break it.

1594
02:29:28,833 --> 02:29:30,249
Darn! Darn him!

1595
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:33,374
Give Ranade the code to break.
Keep the ground search going.

1596
02:29:33,458 --> 02:29:37,499
And continue monitoring
the frequency he called from.

1597
02:29:37,583 --> 02:29:41,374
We only have till tomorrow morning.
contact the base camp.

1598
02:29:41,458 --> 02:29:44,249
Are they ready with the sketch of
the imposter of captain Ranjeev?

1599
02:30:04,625 --> 02:30:07,207
Papa!!

1600
02:30:10,458 --> 02:30:15,749
Papa! Someone help us please!

1601
02:30:23,167 --> 02:30:26,374
Mom, what's happened?

1602
02:30:30,875 --> 02:30:34,207
Papa! Papa!

1603
02:30:53,583 --> 02:30:55,707
Mom! What happened?

1604
02:30:57,333 --> 02:31:00,624
Nothing, go watch some TV.

1605
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:05,541
Rehan. Papa..

1606
02:31:05,625 --> 02:31:09,666
l've just left him at colonel
uncle's. They're both drinking rum.

1607
02:31:12,083 --> 02:31:15,291
He said he'll stay there tonight.

1608
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,624
The search is on for a terrorist
hiding in the outskirts of Srinagar.

1609
02:31:21,708 --> 02:31:26,082
This terrorist is badly wounded
and is wearing an army uniform.

1610
02:31:26,167 --> 02:31:29,207
He went missing 8 days ago.

1611
02:31:29,292 --> 02:31:31,791
He has an electronic part with him.

1612
02:31:31,875 --> 02:31:34,624
This is a sketch of
him provided by the army.

1613
02:31:34,708 --> 02:31:38,082
lf you see this man anywhere please
don't try and catch him your self.

1614
02:31:38,167 --> 02:31:39,874
He is armed and dangerous.

1615
02:31:39,958 --> 02:31:42,666
Please contact your nearest
police station immediately.

1616
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:44,874
Or call this number.

1617
02:33:08,208 --> 02:33:11,332
colonel uncle!

1618
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,791
Hello! Hello! can someone hear me?

1619
02:34:08,083 --> 02:34:10,499
Ma'am someone is sending an
SOS from the same frequency.

1620
02:34:10,583 --> 02:34:13,832
Hello. Hello. Yes we read you.

Hello, yes, we can hear you.

1623
02:34:18,667 --> 02:34:21,707
l am Malini Tyagi from the
anti terrorist special forces.

1624
02:34:21,792 --> 02:34:23,291
Who is this?

1625
02:34:24,375 --> 02:34:27,416
l am Zooni Ali Beg.

1626
02:34:28,125 --> 02:34:31,707
My husband. l thought he was dead.

1627
02:34:32,458 --> 02:34:35,166
But he came back 9 days ago.

1628
02:34:35,667 --> 02:34:38,582
l think he's the one
you are looking for.

1629
02:34:40,292 --> 02:34:45,291
He may have killed my
father and my uncle. Or not.

1630
02:34:46,417 --> 02:34:48,249
l don't know.

1631
02:34:48,667 --> 02:34:54,124
l don't know. Just please help us.
l am alone. lt's just me and my son.

1632
02:34:54,208 --> 02:34:57,957
Zooni, Zooni don't panic.
And listen to me carefully.

1633
02:34:58,625 --> 02:35:01,999
Does your husband have some
sort of an electronic part?

1634
02:35:02,083 --> 02:35:08,291
Yes, l saw it on TV.

1635
02:35:08,375 --> 02:35:10,749
lt's with me.

1636
02:35:11,333 --> 02:35:16,582
lt's him. Your husband is
the one we are looking for.

1637
02:35:16,875 --> 02:35:18,499
He is the terrorist.

1638
02:35:23,708 --> 02:35:25,874
Listen to me carefully Zooni.

1639
02:35:25,958 --> 02:35:29,582
l am going to tell you the most
important thing you will ever hear.

1640
02:35:30,167 --> 02:35:33,791
lf he leaves with that trigger,
if he joins his comrades they will..

1641
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:38,624
..use a nuclear bomb
over our country.

1642
02:35:38,708 --> 02:35:41,207
Millions of lndians will die.

1643
02:35:42,125 --> 02:35:47,749
One of them can be my daughter.
Another can be your son.

1644
02:35:48,708 --> 02:35:50,707
There will be complete
destruction,..

1645
02:35:50,792 --> 02:35:56,332
..and the only one who
can stop it Zooni, is you!

1646
02:35:58,083 --> 02:36:02,249
But, he is my husband.

1647
02:36:02,417 --> 02:36:05,166
Tell me you will help us Zooni.

1648
02:36:06,125 --> 02:36:08,916
Tell me you will stop him.
Whatever it takes.

1649
02:36:09,708 --> 02:36:11,166
Tell me, Zooni.

1650
02:36:13,667 --> 02:36:16,291
Yes.

1651
02:36:16,667 --> 02:36:19,416
We have your location now Zooni.

1652
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:21,416
We know where you are..

1653
02:36:21,750 --> 02:36:24,582
..we'll be there tomorrow morning.
Ok.

1654
02:36:47,667 --> 02:36:57,707
Zooni!

1655
02:37:21,375 --> 02:37:23,374
Who are you running away from?

1656
02:37:24,708 --> 02:37:28,374
From me? From your Rehan?

1657
02:37:30,083 --> 02:37:34,124
l have only one Rehan. My son.

1658
02:37:37,083 --> 02:37:39,624
Papa? What happened?

1659
02:37:41,542 --> 02:37:44,499
Nothing son. Everything is fine.

1660
02:37:46,292 --> 02:37:47,624
Go to sleep.

1661
02:37:50,292 --> 02:37:54,499
What's the point?
You'll kill him as well.

1662
02:37:56,667 --> 02:37:58,582
l'd rather die first.

1663
02:37:58,667 --> 02:38:01,207
You killed Papa quite easily.

1664
02:38:05,583 --> 02:38:10,874
l didn't kill him.
lt was an accident.

1665
02:38:14,417 --> 02:38:16,166
And colonel Uncle?

1666
02:38:27,458 --> 02:38:29,416
Give me the trigger Zooni.

1667
02:38:30,125 --> 02:38:31,832
No.
- Zooni!

1668
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:37,666
Give me that trigger!

1669
02:38:39,125 --> 02:38:43,957
What will you do?
Kill me as well? Kill me.

1670
02:38:44,583 --> 02:38:49,166
l've already died once because
of you, why not once again.

1671
02:38:51,333 --> 02:38:55,082
Zooni, despite all my lies.

1672
02:38:56,208 --> 02:39:01,082
Despite all the pain
l have given you.

1673
02:39:02,625 --> 02:39:05,374
Do you believe that l love you?

1674
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:10,374
Then for the sake of that love.

1675
02:39:10,917 --> 02:39:15,957
You have to do what l say.
lf you don't give me that trigger..

1676
02:39:16,208 --> 02:39:20,416
..then they will torture and
kill Rehan right in front of us.

1677
02:39:21,542 --> 02:39:23,791
Then they'll kill you
in front of me.

1678
02:39:24,417 --> 02:39:28,582
Then if they have any mercy,
then they will kill me too

1679
02:39:30,125 --> 02:39:33,332
And the person to do all
this will be no stranger.

1680
02:39:33,708 --> 02:39:39,041
My own grandfather will destroy
his family with his own hands.

1681
02:39:40,708 --> 02:39:42,791
l don't care about myself Zooni,

1682
02:39:43,375 --> 02:39:46,499
..but l am not willing
to sacrifice Rehan or you.

1683
02:39:49,542 --> 02:39:52,041
This is the only way.

1684
02:39:52,958 --> 02:40:00,457
This is the only way we'll be able
to live our lives in peace again.

1685
02:40:04,167 --> 02:40:07,832
And what about the lives of those
millions that will die from the bomb?

1686
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,166
No one will use the bomb.

1687
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:12,207
lt's just a threat.

1688
02:40:12,292 --> 02:40:14,124
The governments of lndia and
Pakistan will have no other choice..

1689
02:40:14,208 --> 02:40:15,999
..but to give in.

1690
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:27,457
After all your lies,
how can l believe you now?

1691
02:40:32,125 --> 02:40:33,624
Grandfather

1692
02:40:35,208 --> 02:40:39,749
Or the lndian army whom l called.

1693
02:40:50,083 --> 02:40:52,916
No. Grandfather.

1694
02:40:56,583 --> 02:40:58,374
You can't leave.

1695
02:41:05,417 --> 02:41:09,082
Take care of Rehan and yourself.

1696
02:41:10,500 --> 02:41:12,666
l'll be back tomorrow.

1697
02:41:35,458 --> 02:41:39,582
Rehan! Please for
our son's sake. Stop!

1698
02:42:48,083 --> 02:42:49,791
l love you, Rehan.

1699
02:42:51,625 --> 02:42:52,999
l love you.

1700
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:30,374
Rehan!

1701
02:43:38,375 --> 02:43:40,624
Why Rehan? Why?

1702
02:43:46,375 --> 02:43:50,916
Rehan loves you more
than you love Rehan.

1703
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:55,416
Don't say that. Please don't.

1704
02:44:05,875 --> 02:44:07,957
Now l'm not scared.

1705
02:44:21,583 --> 02:44:22,791
Rehan..

1706
02:44:27,875 --> 02:44:29,957
Rehan!

1707
02:44:30,333 --> 02:44:33,666
"O Almighty."

1708
02:44:38,167 --> 02:44:43,249
"When l have your hands in mine"

1709
02:44:43,333 --> 02:44:48,374
"l have with me heavens divine"

1710
02:44:48,458 --> 02:44:53,416
"When l have your hands in mine"

1711
02:44:53,583 --> 02:44:58,791
"l have with me heavens divine"

1712
02:44:58,875 --> 02:45:03,791
"When you're close
this world is naught"

1713
02:45:03,875 --> 02:45:08,791
"Destroyed in your love,
a triumph sought"

1714
02:45:09,292 --> 02:45:13,082
lt's easy to choose
between right and wrong.

1715
02:45:13,750 --> 02:45:19,082
But to choose the greater of two
goods or the lesser of two evils.

1716
02:45:20,625 --> 02:45:23,374
Those are the choices of our life.

1717
02:45:26,125 --> 02:45:29,082
Was Rehans father a bad man?

1718
02:45:30,375 --> 02:45:34,416
Sometimes, one might be right,
but other might take him to be bad.

1719
02:45:35,958 --> 02:45:39,499
Your father did what he felt right.

1720
02:45:44,375 --> 02:45:47,082
Rehan loves you very much

1721
02:45:50,292 --> 02:45:53,124
And Zooni loves Rehan very much.
