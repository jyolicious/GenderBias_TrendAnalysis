1
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:36,987
Hey, Rahul! Want to be friends?

2
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:21,031
She looks just like her father.

3
00:04:22,032 --> 00:04:22,908
Doesn't she?

4
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:26,662
Tina's condition is very critical, Rahul.

5
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:28,205
She doesn't have much time.

6
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,207
We tried our best.

7
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:35,087
She had severe internal bleeding.
We couldn't do anything.

8
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:40,384
She knew there would be
complications in her delivery.

9
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,888
She also knew how much
you wanted this child.

10
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,642
She loved this baby more than her life.

11
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:53,105
I want my daughter to know me.

12
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:55,774
Who her mother was, what she was like.

13
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,070
l want her to be able to answer
all these questions herself.

14
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:06,452
Mum, I am leaving these
eight letters for her...

15
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:11,415
A letter for each of her birthdays.

16
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:16,754
These letters have everything
that I want to tell my daughter.

17
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,675
These letters are going
to be her memories.

18
00:05:37,524 --> 00:05:38,484
You are very bad.

19
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:44,281
You are very bad.

20
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:54,625
Rahul, hey, Rahul!

21
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,177
Want to be friends?

22
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:17,815
Promise me, you will never cry.

23
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,276
Never.

24
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:32,621
Anyway, you look very bad when you cry.

25
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,718
Will you make me one more promise?

26
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:49,388
Please.

27
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:56,270
You'll name our daughter Anjali.

28
00:06:58,063 --> 00:06:59,189
Promise me...

29
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:08,365
I'm sorry, Rahul.
I'm really sorry.

30
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:14,830
Don't go.

31
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,439
Will you make me one more promise?

32
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:44,276
You'll name our daughter Anjali.
Promise me.

33
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:55,037
Hi! I'm Anjali and you're
watching Channel Anjali.

34
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:59,458
I am going to grow up and become a V.J...
You know, just like Neelam.

35
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:04,213
Hey, cut... cut... cut.
I'll be back after the break.

36
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:07,674
My hobbies are eating chocolates...

37
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:10,469
...beating up boys,
troubling my grandmother...

38
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:13,514
...and reading mom's letters.

39
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:18,769
Hey, I'm late. I have to get dressed
and meet my father.

40
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:22,815
But I'll be back next week,
same time, same place. Watch me.

41
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,484
No... no. I don't want
to hear anything.

42
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,986
-I swear I'll not do it again.
-Leave me, I don't want to hear anything.

43
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,154
-Please.
-No.

44
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:49,550
Hi!

45
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:53,095
Anjali, listen to me. Look...

46
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:58,475
Look, I'm just...
Two hours late.

47
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,895
-Right!
-Okay, I'm sorry. I was busy.

48
00:09:02,062 --> 00:09:03,522
So was I.

49
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:06,066
I haven't even watched
television today...

50
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,694
Because I was supposed to meet you.

51
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:11,071
-To shop for you.
-Yeah.

52
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:12,739
This is too much, Papa.

53
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:16,368
I can't do everything.
I'm your daughter not your wife.

54
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:19,997
Why?

55
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:24,585
If I can be both your papa and mama...

56
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:27,838
Okay.

57
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,055
-What is it?
-Did you feel bad?

58
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:38,765
A bit.

59
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,225
-Sorry.
-Okay.

60
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,438
Okay.

61
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:50,694
That is why one says,
there is only one god in many forms.

62
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:56,658
No matter what form,
he knows our devotion.

63
00:09:57,492 --> 00:10:00,787
It is important to keep
this bond with god.

64
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:02,831
She speaks so well, doesn't she?

65
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,542
So, that's all for today.

66
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,921
Now we'll have...

67
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,381
I got this gift for Valentine's day.

68
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,467
-Roopa?
-Me?

69
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,345
Roopa will chant the divine hymn.

70
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,512
Me?

71
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:19,097
Please begin, Roopa.

72
00:10:20,766 --> 00:10:24,228
-I have forgotten the divine hymn.
-What?

73
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,313
What are you saying, Roopa?

74
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:30,734
Did you hear that, sisters?
She has forgotten the divine hymn.

75
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:34,279
My dear if you don't pay
attention to prayer,

76
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:36,240
what will you teach your children?

77
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:41,620
The way we think and the things we say
have a deep impact on our children.

78
00:10:41,954 --> 00:10:44,665
-Then what will she teach her children?
-Grandma...

79
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:47,209
We were talking about children...

80
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,586
-This is my granddaughter, Anjali.
-Greetings.

81
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:51,838
Hi, sexy!

82
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,843
She has taught
her granddaughter very well.

83
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:59,221
-Who taught you that?
-Papa.

84
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,936
Go get ready for the school function.

85
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,564
Grandma, the letter.

86
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:11,525
-When is your birthday?
-Tomorrow.

87
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:12,651
So?

88
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:14,903
Go...

89
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:19,950
Come on, hurry up.

90
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,035
-Here are our seats.
-Sit down.

91
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:25,038
Mr. Khanna, come, come.
Take your seat.

92
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:26,248
-Greetings.
-Greetings.

93
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:27,958
-Hi, Makhaiya. Hello...
-Hello...

94
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,293
Enough.

95
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,963
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.

96
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:36,008
And welcome to the
just one minute competition.

97
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:37,718
It's a strange competition.

98
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:40,220
Children have to speak on stage...

99
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:44,808
And the topics are given on the spot.

100
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,437
On the spot.

101
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,188
Stop it, Balwir. Control yourself.

102
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:52,316
-Never mind. It's okay.
-Sorry.

103
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,111
But remember, every student
will be given only one minute.

104
00:11:56,236 --> 00:11:57,571
Just one minute.

105
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:01,074
Just one minute?
Only one minute to speak?

106
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:02,993
Exactly. Very unfair.

107
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:07,914
But yet our Jasso wins every year.
She's so talented, you know?

108
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,083
-Best of luck, Jaswinder.
-Same to you.

109
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,462
Our Jaswinder is the best.

110
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:16,340
Actually Anjali is also taking part
in the competition.

111
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:17,591
She'll come second.

112
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:19,259
-You don't worry.
-Thank you very much.

113
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:20,719
Welcome.

114
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,764
Our first contestant is Jaswinder Singh.

115
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:30,062
-Oh, my sweetheart! Come on, go for it!
-Jasso...

116
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:32,606
Come on, go for it.

117
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,780
My topic is Prayer.

118
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:42,949
Every morning we pray to the lord.

119
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:47,537
Papa says prayers will keep god happy...

120
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:50,540
-And he'll protect us.
-Wow!

121
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:54,586
Mum says that by praying
Grandma will be impressed,

122
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,798
and will leave the big
house for us in the will.

123
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:02,552
Prayer...

124
00:13:03,345 --> 00:13:05,764
Pooja Bhatt is my favorite actress.

125
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:08,475
And my best friend's name
is also Pooja.

126
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,476
Okay, thank you.

127
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:12,479
-Wow! She was the best!
-So nice.

128
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:14,856
Next participant is Anjali Khanna.

129
00:13:17,943 --> 00:13:18,985
Pick your topic.

130
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,408
She'll come second.

131
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,178
Your time starts now.

132
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:59,109
Say...

133
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:03,572
Mother...

134
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:16,543
Mother...

135
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:23,884
Mother...

136
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,394
I'm sorry...

137
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:37,230
"Mother!"

138
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,868
A mother is someone who loves us so much,

139
00:14:51,286 --> 00:14:53,747
that we sometimes can't understand it.

140
00:14:55,957 --> 00:15:00,587
A mother is someone who makes
us realize how good we are,

141
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:04,174
and there's no one better than us.

142
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:10,430
Her happiness is in our laughter...

143
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:13,642
...and sorrow in our sorrow.

144
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:18,730
She is someone we can't live without...

145
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,316
Mother...

146
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:23,944
She is everything.

147
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:27,447
Only we don't have her.

148
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:33,119
But we have a father.

149
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:37,791
And he is not that bad...

150
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:42,295
Then you give me a hug.

151
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:45,799
That's number one!

152
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:07,821
By the way, Rahul,
you remember Mr. Sharma?

153
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,115
-He called me.
-Who Mr. Sharma?

154
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:13,577
Our neighbor from Delhi.
He has sent a proposal.

155
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,454
-For whom?
-For me.

156
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,749
-Then get married.
-Shut up.

157
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,044
He was saying that the girl
is beautiful and well-mannered.

158
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,046
I flatly refused.

159
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,674
-I did the right thing, didn't I?
-Yes.

160
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,385
-I did the right thing?
-Yes.

161
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:32,137
Did I do the right thing?

162
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,099
Yes, Mom.

163
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:39,394
Well, I must have done the right thing.

164
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:43,398
l never do anything wrong.
I always do the right thing.

165
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:48,862
So what if the girl is well-mannered
and beautiful.

166
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:51,906
Everyone is beautiful and well-mannered.

167
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:55,535
Who wants to get married?
Mr. Sharma has gone mad.

168
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:58,663
Keeps sending me proposals.

169
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:01,833
Why doesn't he get himself married
and just leave me alone?

170
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:10,759
What's wrong, mom?

171
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:13,553
I don't know, Rahul.

172
00:17:14,471 --> 00:17:17,223
I feel like this family is incomplete.

173
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:19,851
Why?

174
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:24,731
You're here, I'm here and Anjali is here.

175
00:17:26,316 --> 00:17:27,609
I don't feel like that.

176
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:33,156
You know, when I go out with my friends,

177
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:35,784
they always complain about
their daughters-in-law.

178
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,869
-Do they?
-But I can't even do that.

179
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:43,750
This is a big problem!

180
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,839
So you need a daughter-in-law
to complain about.

181
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:54,511
No, son.

182
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:58,306
I just want you to be happy.

183
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,309
I'm happy.

184
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:03,603
Very happy.

185
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,566
So you won't marry again?

186
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:21,371
Mom, we live once, die once,

187
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:24,332
get married once...

188
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,670
And we fall in love only once.

189
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,092
It does not happen often.

190
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:39,848
You are fine, but what about Anjali?

191
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:43,101
Why?

192
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,562
What happened to her?

193
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:49,691
Don't you think she needs a mother?

194
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:57,532
She's fine.

195
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:00,994
She's fine.

196
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:11,713
She's got something even I don't have.

197
00:19:15,383 --> 00:19:16,509
Her mother's letters.

198
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,480
Happy birthday, Anjali.

199
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:53,880
My dear, Anjali.
Happy Birthday, Anjali.

200
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:55,840
You are eight years old today.

201
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:59,344
I'm sure you look just like your dad.

202
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,847
That same smile, those same eyes.
Isn't it?

203
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:05,183
No, I look like you.

204
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,438
Tell me, Anjali, does your father
still sleep with his shoes on?

205
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,982
Old habits die hard.

206
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,444
You're a big girl today, Anjali.

207
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,282
So you will be able to understand
what I have to tell you.

208
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:24,285
Today, I'm going to tell you a story.

209
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,956
This story is about your father, me

210
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:30,291
and Anjali.

211
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,085
Anjali?

212
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:56,943
You're late again.

213
00:20:57,694 --> 00:20:59,612
I can't wake up so early.

214
00:20:59,696 --> 00:21:02,657
Can't wake up or were you scared?

215
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:06,536
Rahul Khanna is not scared of anyone.

216
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:09,581
-"Rahul Khanna is not scared of anyone."
-Yeah.

217
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:14,127
But loses to Anjali Sharma
everyday in Basketball.

218
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:17,463
Don't want to play?

219
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:20,800
What's the point, you lose every day.

220
00:21:21,384 --> 00:21:22,677
I won't lose today.

221
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,263
You say that every day.

222
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,473
We'll see.

223
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:30,810
-Oh, shit.
-We will see.

224
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,697
Anjali, that's wrong. You can't...

225
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:45,825
Anjali! You can't turn that way.
Wait...

226
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,040
Yes!

227
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:53,917
Shit!

228
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,964
You...

229
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:06,095
Come on, come on.

230
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:20,276
Yes!

231
00:22:23,071 --> 00:22:23,988
Come on.

232
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:28,284
Come on... Come... Come.
Come and get it.

233
00:22:29,118 --> 00:22:30,578
Come on... Come on... You...

234
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:32,580
That's... that's cool.

235
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:37,460
Come... Come... Yes... Yes... Yes...

236
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,754
Oh, no!

237
00:22:58,648 --> 00:22:59,774
Yes!

238
00:23:04,737 --> 00:23:06,823
If you can't play, at least don't cheat.

239
00:23:06,906 --> 00:23:09,200
Don't call me a cheater.

240
00:23:09,325 --> 00:23:12,453
That's what you are,
cheater, cheater, cheater!

241
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,455
Anjali, don't call me a cheater.

242
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:20,837
-No, I'm not a cheater.
-Cheater!

243
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:24,549
Silly girl.

244
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,593
Don't scream like a girl.

245
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:29,137
Hey, don't call me a girl.

246
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,639
Actually, you're right,
you're not a girl.

247
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:34,726
At least better than those
girls you run after.

248
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:38,146
Excuse me! I don't run after
them, they run after me.

249
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:40,815
Rahul's right here.

250
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:43,026
Wow! Rahul's so cute.
He's so sweet.

251
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,610
"He's so handsome, isn't he?"

252
00:23:44,694 --> 00:23:47,321
Not as handsome as you,
you have a better mustache.

253
00:23:47,488 --> 00:23:49,323
-Was that a joke?
-What if it was?

254
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,618
-I don't like jokes.
-I don't like you.

255
00:23:55,455 --> 00:23:56,581
Shut up.

256
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,794
Rahul and Anjali have fought again.

257
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:03,629
Rahul and Anjali have fought again.

258
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:05,339
Rahul and Anjali had a fight

259
00:24:05,423 --> 00:24:07,216
Rahul and Anjali have fought again.

260
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:10,303
What sort of a boy is he

261
00:24:13,306 --> 00:24:15,933
What sort of a girl is she?

262
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:21,105
What do I do with him?

263
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:26,903
What do I tell her?

264
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:29,864
He fights with me

265
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:32,408
She's a big snob

266
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,161
He argues
She gets angry

267
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:38,289
He's crazy
She's crazy

268
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,417
But he's your best friend.

269
00:24:42,126 --> 00:24:43,961
But she's your best friend.

270
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:32,135
Oh, my! Oh, my!
This boy oh, my! Oh, my!

271
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:36,139
Why does he play these pranks?
Please ask him why?

272
00:25:36,222 --> 00:25:40,309
Oh, my! Oh, my!
This boy oh, my! Oh, my!

273
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:44,814
Why does he play these pranks?
Please ask him why?

274
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:48,359
Sometimes he fights
And sometimes he argues

275
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:52,238
Stay away from him

276
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:55,908
This boy is crazy

277
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:59,745
Crazy, crazy, crazy

278
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:04,208
This boy is crazy

279
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:08,129
Crazy, crazy, crazy

280
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:12,008
Oh, my! Oh, my!
This girl oh, my! Oh, my!

281
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:15,595
Why does he play these pranks?
Please ask him why?

282
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:19,599
Sometimes she fights
And sometimes she argues

283
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:23,352
Stay away from her

284
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:27,273
This girl is crazy

285
00:26:27,356 --> 00:26:31,194
Crazy, crazy, crazy

286
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:34,947
This girl is crazy

287
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:39,118
Crazy, crazy, crazy

288
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:17,073
Only she understands what she says

289
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:21,285
No one else can understand her

290
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:26,916
She's like this and she's like that
No one can figure her out

291
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:32,630
So run, my friends

292
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:36,092
She might be up to some mischief

293
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:39,845
This girl is crazy

294
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:43,766
Crazy, crazy, crazy

295
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:47,270
This boy is crazy

296
00:27:47,353 --> 00:27:52,066
Crazy, crazy, crazy

297
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:35,401
He teases us as he comes by

298
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:39,363
He does not listen to me

299
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:42,950
Beware, he's crazy

300
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:46,620
Stay away from him

301
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:49,623
He is weird

302
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:54,545
And yet he is dear to me

303
00:28:54,754 --> 00:28:58,299
This boy is crazy

304
00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:01,969
Crazy, crazy, crazy

305
00:29:02,053 --> 00:29:05,890
This girl is crazy

306
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:09,852
Crazy, crazy, crazy

307
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:14,315
Oh, my! Oh, my!
This boy oh, my! Oh, my!

308
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,319
Why does he play these pranks?
Please ask him why?

309
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:21,906
Sometimes she fights
And sometimes she argues

310
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:25,701
Stay away from her

311
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:29,663
This girl is crazy

312
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:33,626
Crazy, crazy, crazy

313
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,046
This boy is crazy

314
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:40,800
Crazy, crazy, crazy

315
00:30:35,938 --> 00:30:37,898
Coming up is the
Rock Stewart classic.

316
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:39,567
The first cut is the deepest.

317
00:30:42,236 --> 00:30:45,489
Oh, God! This room is in a complete mess.

318
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:48,200
These girls will drive me crazy.
Silly girls.

319
00:30:48,409 --> 00:30:51,871
Hey! What is this mountain on your head?

320
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:53,998
These are rollers, Rifat Bi.

321
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:56,250
"These are rollers, Rifat Bi."

322
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,962
Rollers don't impress boys.
You can take that from me.

323
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:04,049
Then what will they fall for, Rifat Bi?

324
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:07,303
Oh, god! What are you wearing?

325
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,346
-You should be ashamed.
-Tell me.

326
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,307
I don't know.

327
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:13,392
-Please, tell us.
-No.

328
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,603
Tell us.

329
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,813
Okay.

330
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:22,151
Boys will fall for a girl's grace
and style.

331
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,906
They'll go crazy over
the way they walk, talk and...

332
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,574
And?

333
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,577
And I don't know.

334
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:33,454
You girls talk too much.

335
00:31:33,537 --> 00:31:37,541
Come on, clean up this mess.

336
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,919
Oh, God! What do I do with this girl?

337
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:43,923
Anjali, what's this?
What are you wearing?

338
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:46,258
-It's cool, Rifat Bi.
-Cool.

339
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:49,595
Try to be feminine once
in a while at least.

340
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:52,431
Not like them, but little bit.

341
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:54,725
Rifat bi, you say the same thing everyday.

342
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:57,436
You know, I beat Rahul
at basketball again.

343
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:01,232
-Rahul? Stay away from that boy.
-Why?

344
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:03,108
He's my best friend.
He's my friend.

345
00:32:03,317 --> 00:32:06,111
You never know when this friend
will turn into a lover.

346
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:08,489
Rahul? Please! Never! Yuck.

347
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,074
Yeah, I know it all.

348
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:12,076
Here I've got you some pudding.
Don't tell anyone.

349
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,371
-Thank you!
-Let me go! Crazy girl.

350
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,041
Hi, Radio Xaviers' wishes you
happy Friendship day.

351
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:23,754
Oh, my God!

352
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:26,966
No short skirts in my college, please.

353
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,177
What a beautiful morning today.

354
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:32,137
Good morning Ms. Briganza.

355
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:34,306
Good morning, boys.

356
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:36,141
Nice color, Piyush.

357
00:32:37,726 --> 00:32:39,562
I'm going to complain to your parents

358
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:42,523
you wear short skirts to
college in order to excite the boys.

359
00:32:42,606 --> 00:32:43,649
Excuse me.

360
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,488
I said, no short skirts
in the college, please.

361
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,493
Miss Briganza.

362
00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:57,246
You were saying something, Mr. Malhotra.

363
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:03,002
I was just saying,
wearing short skirts isn't permitted.

364
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:06,463
What? But this is the latest fashion,
Mr. Malhotra.

365
00:33:06,547 --> 00:33:09,842
This is nothing.
Some girls aren't even wearing skirts.

366
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,221
-Don't tell me that, Ms. Briganza.
-Yes, Mr. Malhotra.

367
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,435
Mr. Malhotra,
don't I look beautiful today?

368
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:22,479
You are very quite.

369
00:33:22,896 --> 00:33:23,856
"Quite"?

370
00:33:24,481 --> 00:33:25,566
Cute.

371
00:33:26,025 --> 00:33:27,818
You're very cute.

372
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:35,451
If you expose like this in college,
these young boys and girls...

373
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:37,161
What do you mean by
young boys and girls?

374
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,954
Do you mean to say I'm not young?

375
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:42,374
You're very young.

376
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:46,378
But, Mr. Malhotra, you wear
very boring clothes.

377
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:48,547
I know.

378
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:50,382
But you know...

379
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,886
When Mrs. Malhotra was alive,

380
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:57,514
I used to wear fancy clothes
for her sometimes.

381
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:00,934
-Really?
-But they're of no use anymore.

382
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:03,103
What do you mean,
"of no use anymore"?

383
00:34:04,855 --> 00:34:09,777
Mr. Malhotra... Ms. Briganza...

384
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,447
Mrs. Malhotra...

385
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:26,585
-Happy Friendship Day
-What are you doing?

386
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:29,421
Sharma. Always scaring me.
What're you doing?

387
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:30,798
This is a friendship band, sir.

388
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:33,717
Now I'm not just your student,
I'm your friend, as well.

389
00:34:34,718 --> 00:34:36,011
Very good.

390
00:34:36,512 --> 00:34:38,889
Sir, you look very happy today.

391
00:34:39,348 --> 00:34:40,474
What do you mean?

392
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:43,811
-No, I'm just asking, generally.
-Generally.

393
00:34:43,894 --> 00:34:46,772
Generally, my daughter
is coming back today, that's why.

394
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:48,899
-Your daughter?
-Yes, Tina.

395
00:34:48,982 --> 00:34:50,943
-She's coming back from London.
-From London?

396
00:34:51,026 --> 00:34:53,612
Yes, she was studying
at Oxford University.

397
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:55,823
Oxford University? Wow!

398
00:34:55,948 --> 00:34:57,574
We all used to live there.

399
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:01,995
But when I lost my wife,
I couldn't stay there anymore,

400
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,039
so I decided to come back to India.

401
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,916
Didn't Tina come with you?

402
00:35:05,999 --> 00:35:08,127
No, Tina wanted to finish her studies.

403
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:12,631
But I yearned to see her.

404
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:15,926
So I told her to finish her final year
in my college.

405
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:19,012
After all our college is no less
than Oxford University.

406
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,264
Yes, sir!

407
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:22,558
My child, you'll take care
of my Tina, won't you?

408
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:23,809
Off course, sir.

409
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:26,270
-Happy "Friendship Day."
-Thank you, sir.

410
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:29,565
-Good.
-Rahul? Unbelievable.

411
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,861
You know, I'm the first girl to get
a friendship band from Rahul.

412
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:35,863
-Wow!
-Isn't it exciting?

413
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:37,072
Of course.

414
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:41,118
-You know, Sonia...
-Yes.

415
00:35:41,368 --> 00:35:44,163
You're the only one
I'm giving this friendship band to.

416
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:46,165
-Really, Rahul?
-Really, Sonia.

417
00:35:46,415 --> 00:35:50,294
Because you're different from others.
And you're the most beautiful girl here.

418
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,546
-Really, Rahul?
-Really Sonia.

419
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:56,550
Oh, Rahul! Are you telling me the truth?

420
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:59,511
-Really, Tania.
-My name is Sonia.

421
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:02,514
Yes. Do you see?

422
00:36:02,848 --> 00:36:05,851
I was so lost in your eyes
that I forgot your name.

423
00:36:06,101 --> 00:36:08,896
-I just can't believe this, Rahul.
-Trust me.

424
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:11,356
-Oh, Rahul...
-Oh, Sonia.

425
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:15,027
Stop it, Rahul.

426
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,245
Oh, Sonia.

427
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:27,623
Oh, Rahul.

428
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:33,045
These fell off.

429
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:34,588
-Not mine.
-You cheat!

430
00:36:34,755 --> 00:36:38,383
-You liar.
-Hey, come on.

431
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:42,304
Oh! No... No... Tania,
what's your name?

432
00:36:42,387 --> 00:36:45,057
-Sonia.
-Go away.

433
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:47,434
Wasted my half-hour.

434
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:50,604
Don't you get tired of chasing
after these stupid girls?

435
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:53,816
-Hey, I don't run after girls...
-I know, I know it.

436
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:59,321
Can't you find one girl
with beauty and brains?

437
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:03,700
Good! Beauty and brains?

438
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,870
Where will I find such a girl?

439
00:37:12,084 --> 00:37:16,296
I'm only passing my time with these girls.
I haven't found her as yet.

440
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,882
-Her?
-Her.

441
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:29,309
I'm looking for a girl who
makes something happen.

442
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,144
Makes what happen?

443
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,898
-Makes something happen in my heart.
-Makes what happen?

444
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:40,863
Something happens.

445
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:43,699
You won't understand.

446
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:52,332
When she walks, the world looks on.

447
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,798
And when she stops, time stops.

448
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:05,679
And when she smiles...

449
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,806
"She, she, she."

450
00:38:08,265 --> 00:38:10,058
What will you do if you find her?

451
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,604
-What will I do if I find her?
-Yes.

452
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:21,236
I'll kneel down in front of her,
spread my arms and say...

453
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:24,823
"Hey! Whoever you are, I love you."

454
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,923
-I love you.
-Sorry.

455
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:43,091
Don't be! I love you.

456
00:38:43,884 --> 00:38:46,094
-Excuse me.
-No... No... Squeeze me.

457
00:38:48,096 --> 00:38:49,681
Tina!

458
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,269
Tina.

459
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,271
-Hi, I'm Anjali.
-Hi.

460
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,815
-Hi, I'm Rahul
-Hi.

461
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:00,651
-Tina, right?
-Yeah.

462
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,986
-How do you know her?
-This morning the Principal...

463
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,948
Don't utter that old man's name
early in the morning.

464
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,492
So, Tina, today's your first day
in the college?

465
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:11,495
-She just came from London.
-How do you know that?

466
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:13,580
Because, Rahul, this morning,
the Principal had...

467
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,707
Didn't I tell you not to utter
that bald man's name? Okay?

468
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,292
-Bald.
-So, Tina,

469
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:20,253
-where were you studying in London?
-At Oxford University.

470
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:22,422
Oxford... How do you know?

471
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:24,216
Because the Principal told me
this morning.

472
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:27,344
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Please, let that bald man be.

473
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:29,012
He's a grouch of a principal.

474
00:39:29,096 --> 00:39:30,931
-And she's his stooge.
-"Grouch"?

475
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:32,641
Grouch, you're, right.
But forget him.

476
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:36,144
-Tell me how is your first day in college?
-Great.

477
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:38,146
Good morning.
All of you go to your classes.

478
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:39,690
Good morning , Archana.

479
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,818
-Feroze! Cut your hair.
-Jealous?

480
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:44,945
Short skirt... Oh, god.

481
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,531
He's that grouch of a principal.
Good morning, sir.

482
00:39:47,823 --> 00:39:49,616
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

483
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:52,285
Good morning, darling.

484
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:54,955
Short skirts are not allowed
in college, you know that?

485
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:57,874
You know I just got back from London
and haven't had the time to unpack.

486
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,001
Excuse me!

487
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:00,585
-Sir, may I...
-No.

488
00:40:00,752 --> 00:40:04,006
Thank you.
Look, today's Tina's first day in college.

489
00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:06,133
She just got back from London
and hasn't had the time to unpack.

490
00:40:06,216 --> 00:40:07,634
She wore whatever
she could get her hands on.

491
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:08,844
How do you know that?

492
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:11,138
-Sir, I've known Tina since childhood.
-Since childhood?

493
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:12,848
-Really?
-Really, Papa.

494
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:14,099
Really, Papa.

495
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,101
-Papa?
-Papa.

496
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:18,395
-Papa!
-Papa, Papa.

497
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:21,815
Mr. Malhotra, I need you here.

498
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:23,817
Not here, sir, she's waiting
for you in the staff room.

499
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,901
In the staff room!

500
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:27,529
Yeah! We've an important meeting
about your future.

501
00:40:27,612 --> 00:40:30,073
-You take care, sir.
-Bye... Bye... Bye...

502
00:40:30,615 --> 00:40:31,700
Shit.

503
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,160
Excuse me.

504
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,953
Yeah.

505
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,749
"He's old and bald.

506
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:41,460
-"And..."
-Very smart.

507
00:40:41,752 --> 00:40:43,128
Sweet! He's sweet, too.

508
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:47,007
"And he's grouchy."
But he isn't that bad.

509
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,886
-Squeeze me.
-Yes.

510
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:54,514
Happy Friendship Day.

511
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:58,852
We've only just met.
Friendship is a long way off.

512
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:05,525
Oh, shit!

513
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,073
-Hey, did something happen?
-No.

514
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,575
-She's not my type.
-Why?

515
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:15,368
She's not an Indian.

516
00:41:15,577 --> 00:41:19,206
She grew up in London,
and Londoners are quite different.

517
00:41:19,623 --> 00:41:22,751
A girl should make you feel like
you can take her home to mom.

518
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:26,963
You know. No... She's not my type.

519
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:29,841
No, she's not my type.

520
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,968
You'll never get a girl
if you behave like this. Got it?

521
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:33,136
Why not?

522
00:41:33,303 --> 00:41:35,097
-What about you?
-Me? Yuck! Never!

523
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,598
"Yuck"?

524
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:38,809
If I don't find any other girl,
I'll marry you.

525
00:41:38,892 --> 00:41:41,103
Anjali, no one would
want to marry you anyways.

526
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:42,562
Just, shut up.

527
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,614
Babe.

528
00:41:59,037 --> 00:42:00,080
Hey, Tina!

529
00:42:00,664 --> 00:42:01,581
Here.

530
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:02,791
Take this.

531
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:05,794
-What's this?
-This is our college sweatshirt.

532
00:42:05,877 --> 00:42:06,711
Thanks.

533
00:42:06,878 --> 00:42:09,297
Anjali. Can I ask you something?

534
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:10,465
Yeah sure.

535
00:42:12,217 --> 00:42:14,177
Why is everyone staring at me?

536
00:42:15,846 --> 00:42:18,807
Why the boys are staring at you,
you know that already.

537
00:42:18,974 --> 00:42:21,893
And the girls want to know
why the boys are staring at you.

538
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:23,895
So, they're also staring at you.
Yeah?

539
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,273
Yeah.

540
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:29,818
Look, if you have any problem,
come to me.

541
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:31,194
Or you could go to Rahul, you know.

542
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:34,030
-Rahul is the one I met yesterday.
-Right! He's my best friend.

543
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:37,450
We sort of rule this college.

544
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:40,662
Hi, guys.

545
00:42:42,622 --> 00:42:44,249
This is Rahul. See.

546
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,335
-Hi.
-Hi.

547
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:50,297
There's a rule in our college.

548
00:42:50,505 --> 00:42:54,301
We make every fresher sing a song.
You know? Do-Re-Mi.

549
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,303
-Right?
-Right.

550
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,847
Rahul, she's the Principal's daughter.

551
00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:02,142
So what? We can't break our rules, can we?

552
00:43:02,392 --> 00:43:03,476
Right.

553
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,896
-But, Rahul...
-Shut up, Principal's sidekick.

554
00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:12,319
Tina. Tina Malhotra.

555
00:43:13,737 --> 00:43:17,532
London... Oxford University and all?

556
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,330
Sing a song in Hindi for us
and the entire college.

557
00:43:23,413 --> 00:43:24,331
Hindi?

558
00:43:24,414 --> 00:43:26,082
I'm really sorry.

559
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,586
What? Have you forgotten Hindi
after going to London?

560
00:43:29,753 --> 00:43:31,671
Sorry! One minute, one minute.
Excuse me.

561
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:34,174
Rahul, how can she sing
a song in Hindi?

562
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:36,509
Is it because she's
Principal's daughter?

563
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:40,222
If he can't teach her,
how can he teach us? And you shut up.

564
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:43,308
So, Tina, I was saying...

565
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,979
You'll sing a song in Hindi,
and immediately.

566
00:43:48,355 --> 00:43:51,024
Normally, we don't have much time, do we?
Right?

567
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:54,110
-Right.
-Okay. Go on.

568
00:44:21,137 --> 00:44:27,060
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

569
00:44:29,938 --> 00:44:35,902
Lord, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

570
00:44:42,284 --> 00:44:47,998
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

571
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,671
Lord, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

572
00:44:56,506 --> 00:45:01,636
The difficulties of Your devotees

573
00:45:02,178 --> 00:45:06,641
The difficulties of Your servants

574
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,980
You remove in an instant

575
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:18,236
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

576
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:24,826
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

577
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:32,292
Om, Victory to You
The Lord of the Universe

578
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:55,023
Living in London and studying and growing
up there has not made me forget my roots.

579
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:58,109
And you don't forget that.

580
00:46:14,918 --> 00:46:16,211
Yeah... Yeah...

581
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:19,381
Okay, catch it.
Okay... Yeah... Sure.

582
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:21,424
Oh, God!

583
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,576
Hey! You're sitting in my place.

584
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,245
-Oh! I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

585
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:51,704
Hey, Adi, move.

586
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:55,625
Morning class. Good morning.

587
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:57,836
-Good morning, Madam.
-Settle down everyone.

588
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:08,346
Anyway...

589
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:10,598
Today, we're going to start a new lesson.

590
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:16,938
An eternal love story.

591
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,274
The eternal love story.

592
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:22,944
Before I start,
I have to ask you all something.

593
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:26,030
What do you know about love?

594
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:29,284
What do you know of love?

595
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:30,910
What's love?

596
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:34,831
Any one... any one... any one.
No one?

597
00:47:36,374 --> 00:47:37,208
Tina.

598
00:47:38,168 --> 00:47:40,962
-You tell me, what's love?
-Me?

599
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:43,173
I don't know.

600
00:47:44,174 --> 00:47:46,468
Anjali, what're you doing?

601
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:49,012
You tell me, what's love?

602
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,306
Love...

603
00:47:55,101 --> 00:47:56,227
Forget it.

604
00:47:57,353 --> 00:47:59,230
Anyone else...

605
00:48:00,899 --> 00:48:01,733
Rahul.

606
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:05,320
What's love?

607
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:08,406
Love?

608
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:11,326
Love is friendship.

609
00:48:14,996 --> 00:48:19,792
If she can't become my friend,
I can never fall in love with her.

610
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:23,129
Because there's no love
without friendship.

611
00:48:23,922 --> 00:48:26,049
Simple! Love is friendship.

612
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:28,176
Okay, Ms. Briganza.

613
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:29,844
Okay, Rahul.

614
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:32,472
What an absolutely
delightful thought.

615
00:48:33,097 --> 00:48:37,685
Love is friendship.

616
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:40,688
Did you hear that class?
Thank you, Rahul.

617
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:44,192
Thanks for sharing this absolutely
delightful idea with us.

618
00:48:44,567 --> 00:48:48,738
Love is a friendship.

619
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:53,868
So?

620
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:58,081
Want to be friends?

621
00:49:03,586 --> 00:49:04,671
Okay.

622
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,939
Something happens...

623
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,694
Happens...

624
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:35,410
My head. My legs.
I was sleeping upside down.

625
00:49:36,286 --> 00:49:37,203
Hello.

626
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:39,789
Sorry Mr. Malhotra, Briganza here.

627
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:43,626
Yes, Ms. Briganza.

628
00:49:44,002 --> 00:49:45,545
I didn't disturb you, did I?

629
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:48,464
I'm sure, even if I had disturbed you,
you don't mind.

630
00:49:52,135 --> 00:49:53,303
Yes, Ms. Briganza?

631
00:49:53,511 --> 00:49:57,473
Anyway, I called to tell you
that we've finished all our rehearsals.

632
00:49:57,557 --> 00:50:01,519
Our college will be the best
in tomorrow's competition.

633
00:50:01,686 --> 00:50:03,771
Students from other colleges
are going to be spellbound.

634
00:50:03,855 --> 00:50:04,981
You know what I mean?

635
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:08,234
This is all because of you, Ms. Briganza.

636
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:10,903
And I've done it for you, Mr. Malhotra.

637
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:13,156
Really, Ms. Briganza?

638
00:50:14,282 --> 00:50:15,575
Really, Malhotra.

639
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,202
Ms. Briganza.

640
00:50:22,373 --> 00:50:23,458
I fell down.

641
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:29,631
And our next college is our college,
St. Xaviers.

642
00:50:29,881 --> 00:50:33,760
Xaviers! Xaviers! Xaviers!

643
00:50:44,062 --> 00:50:44,979
What?

644
00:50:45,063 --> 00:50:47,190
Oh, my God! He can't come?

645
00:50:47,273 --> 00:50:49,817
Ms. Briganza, there is a curfew
in their area.

646
00:50:49,901 --> 00:50:52,820
They can't leave.
Good God! Now what do we do?

647
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:55,531
We want Xaviers! We want Xaviers!

648
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:59,077
Mr. Malhotra.
Let me think, please...

649
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:03,039
-Idea!
-Idea?

650
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:04,999
Yes.

651
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:05,958
-No.
-No.

652
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:09,545
You have to do this or else
you both are going to fail.

653
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:12,840
But, sir, how can we sing
and dance on stage?

654
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:15,343
-We don't know anything.
-And you know about the students.

655
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,011
-They will not spare us.
-Correct.

656
00:51:17,095 --> 00:51:18,054
-It's a bad idea.
-Right.

657
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:20,682
What do you mean it's a bad idea, Rahul?
Of course, it's a good idea.

658
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:22,058
Nothing will happen to you.

659
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,018
The students who were
going to perform today,

660
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:26,354
have recorded a tape of their rehearsals.

661
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:31,943
I'll play the tape
and you just have to move your lips.

662
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:35,905
Like in the films. Okay.

663
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:37,657
It won't work.

664
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:40,660
Why won't it work?
Of course it'll work.

665
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:43,871
My name is Chin Chin Chu

666
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:46,916
Moonlit sky, you and me
Hello Mr. how do you do?

667
00:51:51,129 --> 00:51:53,423
Ms. Briganza, control yourself.
Control.

668
00:51:56,426 --> 00:51:57,385
-No.
-No.

669
00:52:00,138 --> 00:52:01,431
What do you mean by no?

670
00:52:02,306 --> 00:52:03,266
Anjali, you, too?

671
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:06,060
Anjali, you don't have any concern
for the reputation of your college?

672
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:09,355
-I know.
-That's very tragic! Very tragic.

673
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:16,863
Come on Rahul, it is for the college.

674
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:22,160
-Okay.
-Okay. Come on, Mr. Malhotra.

675
00:52:22,493 --> 00:52:24,120
Okay! Come on, Tina, you join us as well.
Come on.

676
00:52:24,328 --> 00:52:25,955
No, no. I'm not coming.

677
00:52:26,205 --> 00:52:28,291
-What are you saying?
-Hey, Anjali.

678
00:52:29,167 --> 00:52:31,127
Why are you asking her? Let's go.

679
00:52:43,681 --> 00:52:45,475
One and only Rahul.

680
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:52,440
Take it from the top. Play.

681
00:52:52,523 --> 00:52:54,442
What do I play? This must be it.

682
00:52:54,525 --> 00:52:58,654
You're a foreigner

683
00:52:58,738 --> 00:53:03,075
You're a foreigner

684
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:07,288
You won't be here with us for long

685
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:11,417
You're a foreigner

686
00:53:13,419 --> 00:53:14,796
Mr. Malhotra, what's this?

687
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,882
Ms. Briganza, I made a mistake.
I played the wrong tape.

688
00:53:18,966 --> 00:53:20,676
Hey, what the hell is happening?

689
00:53:23,221 --> 00:53:24,347
Go...

690
00:53:24,555 --> 00:53:25,640
Okay. Okay.

691
00:53:32,063 --> 00:53:33,272
Switch off the music.

692
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:27,118
I've found someone

693
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:31,581
I've found someone

694
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:36,919
What's come over me?

695
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:09,076
What has happened to me?

696
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:12,663
Why do l feel so lost?

697
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:19,253
Either l was insane earlier
Or I've just become so

698
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:23,466
Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair

699
00:55:23,716 --> 00:55:26,844
What have you done to yourself?

700
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:30,348
I've found someone
I've found someone

701
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:33,976
I've lost my heart
I've lost my heart

702
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,521
What can I tell you, friends?
What can I tell you, friends?

703
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:41,067
I'm all shook up
I'm all shook up

704
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,027
I've found someone

705
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:48,282
Really, I've found someone

706
00:55:48,366 --> 00:55:52,161
I've found someone

707
00:55:52,244 --> 00:55:55,164
What has happened to me?

708
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:58,584
Why have I lost myself?

709
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:02,213
Either I was insane earlier

710
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:06,133
Or I've just become so

711
00:56:06,217 --> 00:56:09,553
Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair

712
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:12,515
What have you done to yourself?

713
00:56:12,682 --> 00:56:16,143
I've found someone
I've found someone

714
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:19,814
I've lost my heart
I've lost my heart

715
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:22,984
What can I tell you, friends?
What can I tell you, friends?

716
00:56:23,067 --> 00:56:25,069
I'm all shook up

717
00:56:25,152 --> 00:56:26,821
I'm all shook up

718
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:29,949
I've found someone

719
00:56:30,032 --> 00:56:32,952
Really, I've found someone

720
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:36,914
Really, I've found someone
I've found someone

721
00:57:30,926 --> 00:57:34,221
I don't know what has happened to me

722
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:37,600
People have begun calling me Romeo

723
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:41,562
And why is that so?
We should also know

724
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:44,398
What's happened to you?

725
00:57:44,523 --> 00:57:48,277
Till yesterday l was quite fine

726
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:52,031
My heart was filled with happiness divine

727
00:57:52,114 --> 00:57:55,743
Why are you restless and perplexed?

728
00:57:55,951 --> 00:57:58,913
Have you lost something?

729
00:57:58,996 --> 00:58:01,874
I've found someone
I've found someone

730
00:58:01,957 --> 00:58:05,586
I've lost my heart
I've lost my heart

731
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:08,798
What can I tell you, friends?
What can I tell you, friends?

732
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:12,635
I'm all shook up
I'm all shook up

733
00:58:12,718 --> 00:58:15,346
I've found someone

734
00:58:15,846 --> 00:58:18,766
I've found someone

735
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:22,937
Really, I've found someone
I've found someone

736
00:59:02,685 --> 00:59:05,980
Who is this disguised as a cloud?

737
00:59:06,063 --> 00:59:09,358
Who has come and taken over my heart?

738
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:11,360
I would like to say it

739
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:15,739
But I can't name it

740
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:19,952
Don't name it but say something

741
00:59:20,286 --> 00:59:23,581
Give us a slight clue

742
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:27,376
It's in my eyes
It's in my heart

743
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,671
What can l tell you friends?

744
00:59:30,754 --> 00:59:33,841
I've found someone
I've found someone

745
00:59:33,924 --> 00:59:37,261
I've lost my heart

746
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:40,890
What can I tell you, friends?

747
00:59:40,973 --> 00:59:44,393
I'm all shook up
I'm all shook up

748
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:47,354
I've found someone

749
00:59:47,563 --> 00:59:50,608
Really, I've found someone

750
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:54,445
Really, I've found someone

751
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:58,032
I don't know what's happened to me

752
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:02,328
Why am I so lost?

753
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:05,789
Either I was insane earlier

754
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:09,501
Or I've become so now

755
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:13,130
Dreamy eyes and unkempt hair

756
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:16,258
What've you done to yourself?

757
01:00:16,425 --> 01:00:19,511
I've found someone
I've found someone

758
01:00:19,595 --> 01:00:23,307
I've lost my heart
I've lost my heart

759
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,727
What can I tell you, friends?
What can I tell you, friends?

760
01:00:26,852 --> 01:00:30,189
I'm all shook up
I'm all shook up

761
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:32,900
I've found someone

762
01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:36,946
Really, I've found someone

763
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:40,449
Really, I've found someone

764
01:00:40,532 --> 01:00:43,911
Really, I've found someone

765
01:00:43,994 --> 01:00:47,498
Really, I've found someone

766
01:01:45,723 --> 01:01:47,725
Anjali, what's wrong?

767
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:54,356
Don't know why, I am missing mom today.

768
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:57,943
How can you say that when I'm here?

769
01:02:03,657 --> 01:02:08,871
Stupid girl, tears don't solve anything.

770
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,421
Yes, good timing guys.

771
01:02:18,922 --> 01:02:20,883
-Hi...
-Hi...

772
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:25,304
Rahul, juice.

773
01:02:25,721 --> 01:02:27,181
Rahul, juice.

774
01:02:34,813 --> 01:02:36,106
Hey, look at her.

775
01:02:36,315 --> 01:02:39,818
Anjali, how long have you known Rahul?

776
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:42,988
From the first day of college.
Do you know what I did?

777
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:45,699
I beat him in arm wrestling.
Since then we have been best friends.

778
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:47,368
Best friends.

779
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:50,829
Rahul is your best friend, isn't he?

780
01:02:51,538 --> 01:02:54,249
No, I'm Rahul's best friend.

781
01:02:56,919 --> 01:02:58,796
Rahul, juice... Juice...

782
01:02:59,004 --> 01:03:00,506
Aren't you in love with him?

783
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:08,180
Hi.

784
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:10,265
-Shall I go?
-Where?

785
01:03:12,684 --> 01:03:14,395
Today is Tuesday, isn't it?

786
01:03:14,603 --> 01:03:18,649
Yes, Rahul goes and visits his relatives
every Tuesday. Yes.

787
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:21,151
But I'll stay if you want.

788
01:03:21,276 --> 01:03:22,986
-No, Rahul, you go.
-No, I've got some time.

789
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:24,822
-Go, Rahul, you'll be late.
-I can stay.

790
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:25,781
-Go... come on, go
-I can stay.

791
01:03:25,864 --> 01:03:26,990
-Come on... Go...
-Okay...

792
01:03:27,074 --> 01:03:28,075
Bye.

793
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,176
God please see that I don't fail
in my exams this time as well.

794
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,513
I am a bit weak in Chemistry.
So, you take care of it. Okay.

795
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:54,476
Hi.

796
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,111
Hey! Look forward.

797
01:04:10,742 --> 01:04:12,911
Rahul...

798
01:04:13,078 --> 01:04:15,414
-Hi...
-Hi... Hi...

799
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:18,625
So, your relatives live here?

800
01:04:18,792 --> 01:04:22,754
Yes, here, not here. Here.
Not here. Here.

801
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:28,552
So, Rahul Khanna comes
to the temple every Tuesday.

802
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:31,096
-Yeah!
-How sweet!

803
01:04:32,723 --> 01:04:34,558
Why did you lie at college then?

804
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:38,020
Actually boys don't go to the temple.
So...

805
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,105
-But you do.
-Yes.

806
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,940
-Do you come every week?
-Yeah.

807
01:04:42,024 --> 01:04:44,568
-How sweet!
-Look, don't call me sweet.

808
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:47,988
Actually, my dad used to say,
"Don't say this to anyone in the college."

809
01:04:48,071 --> 01:04:49,406
-"This"?
-Not this.

810
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,034
"A man should bow
before three women only.

811
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:54,119
"One before Mom..."
That's his mother.

812
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:56,079
"One before Goddess Durga.

813
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:57,122
"And..."

814
01:04:58,665 --> 01:04:59,500
And?

815
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:02,503
And...

816
01:05:16,391 --> 01:05:17,643
Wear it.

817
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:20,521
What's the word you use?
"Cool"? You'll look cool.

818
01:05:20,604 --> 01:05:23,690
I was just trying it out.
Don't know how others wear all this stuff.

819
01:05:23,774 --> 01:05:27,277
There's nothing wrong in looking
girlish once in a while.

820
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:31,323
Take this letter from your mother.
You were missing her, right?

821
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:32,491
Listen.

822
01:05:32,741 --> 01:05:34,660
-And take this as well.
-What's this?

823
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:35,702
Present.

824
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:47,089
Hey.

825
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:50,425
Tina.

826
01:05:51,426 --> 01:05:52,261
-Hey.
-Rahul.

827
01:05:54,513 --> 01:05:56,098
Rahul, what are you doing here,
at this hour?

828
01:05:56,181 --> 01:05:58,642
Actually I couldn't sleep and I
thought even you won't be asleep...

829
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:00,644
And if you're not sleeping,
then you'll just be thinking about me.

830
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:02,187
-So I came.
-What?

831
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:04,064
By the way, what do you prefer,
flowers or chocolates?

832
01:06:04,147 --> 01:06:05,065
What?

833
01:06:05,148 --> 01:06:07,276
I didn't bring anything.
I was just asking.

834
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:10,112
Just kidding.

835
01:06:12,489 --> 01:06:15,325
-Thank you.
-By the way, I have chocolates as well.

836
01:06:17,661 --> 01:06:21,164
Don't you think it's hot here?
Although, I'm okay.

837
01:06:21,623 --> 01:06:22,874
I'm cool.

838
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,043
Come in.

839
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:27,504
If you insist.

840
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:30,799
-May I?
-Yeah, off course.

841
01:06:30,882 --> 01:06:31,883
Thank you.

842
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:33,635
Nice bed.

843
01:06:34,386 --> 01:06:36,013
Why are you standing?
Please come and sit.

844
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:38,181
-Come... Come...
-Thanks.

845
01:06:44,396 --> 01:06:48,900
Isn't this the novel where the
butler murders the married couple?

846
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:52,362
-Thanks.
-Anytime. You're reading such a fat book.

847
01:06:52,446 --> 01:06:53,405
You could've asked me.

848
01:06:53,488 --> 01:06:54,615
Yes, this is that book.
I've read this.

849
01:06:54,698 --> 01:06:57,659
Rahul, you didn't finish your story.

850
01:06:57,743 --> 01:06:58,785
No, it's nothing special.

851
01:06:58,869 --> 01:07:01,496
This couple goes on a holiday and
leave their butler behind...

852
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,873
Later one finds out the butler is...

853
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:04,958
-Not this story.
-Then?

854
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:06,251
The temple story.

855
01:07:06,585 --> 01:07:08,837
Temple? What temple?
I don't know any temple.

856
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,880
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

857
01:07:10,088 --> 01:07:11,256
-Right.
-Right.

858
01:07:11,965 --> 01:07:12,841
The same story...

859
01:07:13,634 --> 01:07:16,511
A man should bow
before three women.

860
01:07:16,803 --> 01:07:19,681
-Before his mother, before Goddess Durga.
-Is it?

861
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:21,099
-And?
-And?

862
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:22,976
-And?
-And?

863
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,853
-Rahul.
-Tina.

864
01:07:25,395 --> 01:07:26,897
-Rahul.
-Tina.

865
01:07:27,564 --> 01:07:29,608
-Papa! Shut up.
-Grouch.

866
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:31,401
-Rahul, Papa will come.
-Congratulations.

867
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:32,861
-Shut up, Rahul! Leave.
-Okay, Bye-bye.

868
01:07:32,944 --> 01:07:34,071
Not that way.
Rahul, go this way.

869
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:35,072
-My ladder is there.
-There's no way out from here.

870
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:36,448
-And I haven't finished my story.
-You go out first.

871
01:07:36,531 --> 01:07:38,617
-A man bows before three women.
-I don't want to hear anything.

872
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,035
Before Mother, before Goddess Durga.

873
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:42,204
And... And... And... Tina!

874
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:02,599
And...

875
01:08:22,577 --> 01:08:26,915
I'll climb the ladder,
and he'll get caught.

876
01:08:26,998 --> 01:08:28,291
-What?
-Torch.

877
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:29,376
Throw it.

878
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:30,544
-Okay...
-Good.

879
01:08:34,214 --> 01:08:35,173
Who hit me?

880
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:39,219
I'll be a ghost.

881
01:08:39,886 --> 01:08:42,264
If any ghost comes,
it'll get scared of me.

882
01:08:42,347 --> 01:08:44,057
Where has the ladder gone?

883
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:45,308
Ladder?

884
01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:47,310
Ladder?

885
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:50,939
Malhotra!

886
01:08:52,315 --> 01:08:55,235
Why are you entering your own house
like a thief?

887
01:08:56,194 --> 01:08:57,404
Why're you giggling?

888
01:09:05,412 --> 01:09:06,413
Rahul, what are you doing?

889
01:09:06,496 --> 01:09:08,707
-I was just coming to see you.
-Why?

890
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:09,875
That's...

891
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,919
-Anjali, look, a shooting star.
-Where?

892
01:09:13,003 --> 01:09:14,463
Not down here, up there.

893
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:17,966
Did you know, they say, if you make a wish
when you see a shooting star,

894
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:19,468
your wish will be fulfilled.

895
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:22,679
-Do you believe that?
-Let's try.

896
01:09:23,013 --> 01:09:23,930
Okay, make a wish.

897
01:10:32,499 --> 01:10:34,960
You came close to me

898
01:10:37,796 --> 01:10:40,131
Smiled ever so sweetly

899
01:10:42,884 --> 01:10:45,303
You came close to me

900
01:10:45,387 --> 01:10:48,306
Smiled ever so sweetly

901
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:53,770
You don't know how many dreams
You have inspired in me

902
01:10:53,854 --> 01:10:56,064
You came close to me

903
01:10:56,314 --> 01:10:58,733
Smiled ever so sweetly

904
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:01,027
You don't know how many dreams

905
01:11:01,194 --> 01:11:03,154
You have inspired in me

906
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:09,369
Now my heart neither
Wakes up nor sleeps

907
01:11:09,578 --> 01:11:15,208
What am I to do?
Something is happening

908
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:19,713
What am I to do?
Something is happening

909
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,340
You came close to me

910
01:11:22,507 --> 01:11:25,010
Smiled ever so sweetly

911
01:11:25,176 --> 01:11:27,429
You don't know how many dreams

912
01:11:27,637 --> 01:11:29,598
You have inspired in me

913
01:11:30,348 --> 01:11:32,726
Now my heart neither

914
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:34,936
Wakes up nor sleeps

915
01:11:35,854 --> 01:11:40,317
What am I to do?
Something is happening

916
01:11:40,525 --> 01:11:45,780
What am I to do?
Something is happening

917
01:12:06,551 --> 01:12:11,556
Oh! What a feeling this is!

918
01:12:11,806 --> 01:12:16,853
What is this unquenchable thirst?

919
01:12:17,062 --> 01:12:22,525
I know not, this drunken stupor

920
01:12:22,776 --> 01:12:25,111
Of love that's consuming me?

921
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,533
No one knows, why one loses
One's peace, when in love

922
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:35,372
What am I to do?
Something is happening

923
01:12:35,914 --> 01:12:41,336
What am I to do?
Something is happening

924
01:13:16,997 --> 01:13:22,043
My prayers have been answered

925
01:13:22,127 --> 01:13:27,549
God knows when and how I fell in love

926
01:13:27,924 --> 01:13:32,429
I wonder how

927
01:13:32,512 --> 01:13:35,557
I found peace in turmoil

928
01:13:35,724 --> 01:13:41,021
I sit alone, weaving memories

929
01:13:41,104 --> 01:13:45,817
What am I to do?
Something is happening

930
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:50,989
What am I to do?
Something is happening

931
01:13:51,448 --> 01:13:54,075
You came close to me

932
01:13:54,284 --> 01:13:56,786
Smiled ever so sweetly

933
01:13:56,911 --> 01:13:59,080
You don't know how many dreams

934
01:13:59,164 --> 01:14:02,083
You have inspired in me

935
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:04,335
You came close to me

936
01:14:04,419 --> 01:14:06,963
Smiled ever so sweetly

937
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,549
You don't know how many dreams

938
01:14:09,799 --> 01:14:12,260
You have inspired in me

939
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:15,346
Now my heart neither

940
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,223
Wakes up nor sleeps

941
01:14:17,766 --> 01:14:22,771
What am I to do?
Something is happening

942
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:25,398
What am I to do?

943
01:14:25,565 --> 01:14:28,109
Something is happening

944
01:14:42,415 --> 01:14:44,417
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

945
01:14:46,127 --> 01:14:46,961
Hi.

946
01:14:48,755 --> 01:14:51,174
The butler committed the murder.

947
01:14:51,424 --> 01:14:54,219
Oh, God! Look there.

948
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:58,389
What is she wearing?

949
01:15:02,769 --> 01:15:04,229
-Hi guys.
-Hi.

950
01:15:04,729 --> 01:15:05,980
How do I look?

951
01:15:08,775 --> 01:15:10,235
Just like Tina, right?

952
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:11,611
My foot.

953
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:15,031
Come on, tell me.

954
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:27,710
Sorry.

955
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:33,383
Stop it, Rahul.

956
01:15:35,135 --> 01:15:37,262
She's looking so funny.

957
01:15:39,514 --> 01:15:41,099
-Shut up, Rahul.
-No... No...

958
01:16:03,496 --> 01:16:04,581
What?

959
01:16:05,373 --> 01:16:06,374
Gone?

960
01:16:10,378 --> 01:16:11,713
I'm crazy, right?

961
01:16:13,423 --> 01:16:16,134
I wanted to look beautiful like you.

962
01:16:17,302 --> 01:16:18,970
But I don't know anything.

963
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:24,225
Anjali, you are beautiful.
Very beautiful.

964
01:16:24,976 --> 01:16:26,186
You're lying.

965
01:16:26,978 --> 01:16:29,189
Didn't you see how they were
laughing at me?

966
01:16:29,272 --> 01:16:31,274
-Oh! They're...
-They're idiots like me.

967
01:16:32,483 --> 01:16:34,110
Actually, you're very beautiful.

968
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:37,155
Because you're different
from all the other girls.

969
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:40,658
At least you're not like
the other stupid girls I go after.

970
01:16:42,452 --> 01:16:46,623
You know,
you can get any boy you want.

971
01:16:47,165 --> 01:16:48,124
Anyone?

972
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:50,084
Anyone.

973
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:51,836
Anyone?

974
01:16:53,213 --> 01:16:54,297
Anyone.

975
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:56,633
Except, he should have poor eyesight.

976
01:17:01,846 --> 01:17:04,349
Okay, tell me where
you got this lipstick?

977
01:17:04,557 --> 01:17:07,352
Babli in our class?
She gave it to me.

978
01:17:08,353 --> 01:17:10,855
Stupid idiot. I'm going to hit her.

979
01:17:26,037 --> 01:17:31,668
Love is madness
Intoxicating, too

980
01:17:33,503 --> 01:17:39,425
It will be different to
Any happiness or sorrow

981
01:17:39,717 --> 01:17:41,844
-Papa.
-Rahul

982
01:17:42,262 --> 01:17:44,055
-Papa?
-What, "Papa"?

983
01:17:45,056 --> 01:17:47,809
You can't hide anything from me.

984
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:51,604
But Rahul?
Couldn't you find any other boy?

985
01:17:51,688 --> 01:17:52,814
Come on, papa.

986
01:17:53,815 --> 01:17:56,859
Actually, if it had been anyone else
in Rahul's place,

987
01:17:57,777 --> 01:18:00,280
even then, maybe I would feel
exactly the same way.

988
01:18:00,363 --> 01:18:01,322
Why?

989
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:04,909
Because I'll have to share
your love with him. That's why.

990
01:18:08,913 --> 01:18:10,039
I love you, papa.

991
01:18:11,332 --> 01:18:13,126
That's the problem.
I love you, too.

992
01:18:15,211 --> 01:18:17,839
Have you told him how you feel?

993
01:18:28,933 --> 01:18:32,437
I just feel that Rahul and Anjali...

994
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,316
I know Rahul only loves you.

995
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:40,528
And Anjali is just his best friend.
That's all.

996
01:18:41,821 --> 01:18:43,114
No, papa.

997
01:18:43,323 --> 01:18:47,493
Somewhere hidden in this
deep friendship is deep love...

998
01:18:48,369 --> 01:18:49,495
And I don't want...

999
01:18:50,038 --> 01:18:52,165
That friendship that might turn into love,

1000
01:18:52,457 --> 01:18:54,334
I don't want to come in between that.

1001
01:18:54,417 --> 01:18:58,713
The entire college knows
Rahul and Anjali are best friends.

1002
01:18:59,172 --> 01:19:00,173
And nothing else.

1003
01:19:00,715 --> 01:19:04,344
Go. Go and tell him
that you love him a lot.

1004
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:09,932
But I don't know whether
he loves me or not.

1005
01:19:10,391 --> 01:19:12,643
Don't keep matters of the heart a secret.

1006
01:19:12,727 --> 01:19:15,021
Go and tell him.

1007
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:34,499
I...

1008
01:19:34,582 --> 01:19:35,666
I love you.

1009
01:19:38,753 --> 01:19:39,712
I love you.

1010
01:19:44,092 --> 01:19:44,967
Shit.

1011
01:19:46,094 --> 01:19:48,846
I never thought I'd say this to someone...

1012
01:19:49,097 --> 01:19:51,557
But I really love you.

1013
01:19:54,602 --> 01:19:55,561
Shit.

1014
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:00,400
I... I hope.
I can say all this to her.

1015
01:20:00,483 --> 01:20:03,236
You know how many times
I wanted to tell her,

1016
01:20:03,361 --> 01:20:05,071
but every time I go to her,

1017
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,990
when I start to say this...
That's all...

1018
01:20:08,574 --> 01:20:09,826
I think, I'll tell her.

1019
01:20:10,618 --> 01:20:12,578
To who?

1020
01:20:13,788 --> 01:20:15,039
Tina, who else?

1021
01:20:16,624 --> 01:20:19,961
Let's do it again.
I'm Rahul and you're Tina. Okay?

1022
01:20:21,003 --> 01:20:22,755
Hey, look up. Up.

1023
01:20:24,298 --> 01:20:25,466
I...

1024
01:20:34,434 --> 01:20:35,560
I love you.

1025
01:20:41,566 --> 01:20:42,733
I love you, too.

1026
01:20:46,696 --> 01:20:48,114
She'll say that, won't she?

1027
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:52,118
-"Love"?
-Yeah.

1028
01:20:52,493 --> 01:20:53,536
Come here.

1029
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,251
Shall I tell her?

1030
01:21:02,837 --> 01:21:04,297
-Yes.
-Right now?

1031
01:21:08,176 --> 01:21:09,427
Okay.

1032
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:22,565
God, never make anyone writhe
In the pain of love

1033
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:47,048
The heart's feelings
Get buried in the heart

1034
01:21:51,802 --> 01:21:57,600
And never come to the lips

1035
01:22:01,145 --> 01:22:05,983
And never come to the lips

1036
01:22:30,466 --> 01:22:35,596
My first love is incomplete, Rifat bi.
My first love is incomplete.

1037
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,823
I love you.

1038
01:22:55,157 --> 01:23:00,746
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1039
01:23:00,955 --> 01:23:06,919
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1040
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:12,842
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

1041
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,637
There's nothing more left to say

1042
01:23:16,762 --> 01:23:21,892
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1043
01:23:22,852 --> 01:23:28,149
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1044
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:31,777
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

1045
01:23:32,194 --> 01:23:34,864
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

1046
01:23:34,947 --> 01:23:38,367
There's nothing more left to say

1047
01:23:38,451 --> 01:23:44,165
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1048
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:50,046
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1049
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,089
Mom...

1050
01:24:03,643 --> 01:24:06,896
I gave all my happiness to you

1051
01:24:10,024 --> 01:24:12,985
I gave my smiles to you

1052
01:24:15,571 --> 01:24:21,327
Your locks enticed me
Bidding messages of faithfulness

1053
01:24:21,869 --> 01:24:27,083
You couldn't care for my love
You couldn't care for my love

1054
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:31,045
There is nothing more left to say

1055
01:24:31,128 --> 01:24:36,509
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1056
01:24:37,343 --> 01:24:42,932
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

1057
01:24:44,308 --> 01:24:45,434
Excuse me... Sorry.

1058
01:24:45,601 --> 01:24:47,728
Anjali, Anjali.

1059
01:24:47,895 --> 01:24:49,188
Sorry, madam.

1060
01:24:49,438 --> 01:24:51,273
-Rahul, you check in the front.
-Yes.

1061
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:53,567
-I'll check that side.
-Yes, check...

1062
01:24:54,652 --> 01:24:55,486
Anjali...

1063
01:25:02,076 --> 01:25:03,244
One minute.

1064
01:25:04,578 --> 01:25:05,538
Where are you going?

1065
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:07,540
-Home.
-What?

1066
01:25:08,416 --> 01:25:11,627
I got a letter from mom.
My father's not well...

1067
01:25:11,877 --> 01:25:13,921
And there is lots of work
in the new house.

1068
01:25:14,004 --> 01:25:16,298
You've lost it...
You're leaving after receiving a letter.

1069
01:25:16,424 --> 01:25:18,759
-You're not going anywhere. Come.
-Rahul, I must go.

1070
01:25:18,843 --> 01:25:20,720
How can you leave the term midway? Come.

1071
01:25:21,095 --> 01:25:23,556
-Rahul, please try to understand.
-Finish the final exams and then go.

1072
01:25:23,764 --> 01:25:25,891
-But, Rahul it's...
-Go after finishing the final exams.

1073
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,727
-Rahul, please.
-Go after the final exams.

1074
01:25:27,935 --> 01:25:30,438
I may not come back
even for the final term.

1075
01:25:35,693 --> 01:25:37,778
I'm not coming back, Rahul.

1076
01:25:38,112 --> 01:25:42,908
Oh! Then you're leaving college.

1077
01:25:44,285 --> 01:25:45,494
You're leaving me.

1078
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:49,707
And you didn't even tell me.

1079
01:25:51,959 --> 01:25:53,043
Okay.

1080
01:25:55,379 --> 01:25:56,630
I don't want to know.

1081
01:25:57,798 --> 01:25:59,550
-Rahul, I'm going.
-Go.

1082
01:26:00,301 --> 01:26:01,886
-Rahul, I'm going.
-Go...

1083
01:26:02,344 --> 01:26:04,805
-Rahul, I'm not coming back.
-I don't care, okay.

1084
01:26:57,274 --> 01:26:58,400
Shit.

1085
01:27:02,988 --> 01:27:05,324
Anjali, Anjali...

1086
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:09,245
Anjali, please don't go.
Who will I play basketball with?

1087
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:10,913
You used to lose every time.

1088
01:27:11,247 --> 01:27:12,706
Then why are you going?

1089
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:14,542
Mom needs me, Rahul.

1090
01:27:14,834 --> 01:27:16,043
Don't I need you?

1091
01:27:17,002 --> 01:27:19,296
Trouble Tina now, I've had enough.

1092
01:27:20,214 --> 01:27:22,341
-I'll fail.
-Then fail.

1093
01:27:22,424 --> 01:27:23,676
Hey, Anjali...

1094
01:27:23,759 --> 01:27:26,053
Stop chasing those stupid girls now.

1095
01:27:34,395 --> 01:27:36,146
I'll miss you, my friend.

1096
01:27:37,106 --> 01:27:38,190
I'll miss you too.

1097
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:21,400
That day, I felt maybe I had
come between Rahul and Anjali.

1098
01:28:22,192 --> 01:28:24,820
Maybe I had come between two friends.

1099
01:28:26,488 --> 01:28:29,283
Anjali's silence told me everything.

1100
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:33,495
And I knew that
she loved your father very much.

1101
01:28:34,246 --> 01:28:37,333
Perhaps even I couldn't love him as much.

1102
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:40,669
Anjali neither called nor wrote.

1103
01:28:41,545 --> 01:28:45,382
She had gone away from our lives. Forever.

1104
01:28:46,383 --> 01:28:49,511
Your father used to say
love is friendship.

1105
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,972
Yes, I became his friend.

1106
01:28:52,723 --> 01:28:55,351
But I could never become
his best friend.

1107
01:28:55,893 --> 01:28:58,938
I know your father very well.

1108
01:28:59,772 --> 01:29:00,773
He's lonely.

1109
01:29:01,065 --> 01:29:02,608
But he'll never say anything.

1110
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:07,029
His life lacks a friend, lacks a love.

1111
01:29:07,404 --> 01:29:10,532
And that friend is Anjali, dear.
And that love is Anjali.

1112
01:29:12,368 --> 01:29:15,329
Bring Anjali back into your father's life.

1113
01:29:17,289 --> 01:29:19,833
Return Anjali's first love to her.

1114
01:29:21,085 --> 01:29:23,462
Anjali and Rahul are made for each other.

1115
01:29:25,047 --> 01:29:27,675
This is the truth,
and this is my dream.

1116
01:29:37,101 --> 01:29:39,561
Will you fulfill your mother's dream?

1117
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:43,649
Bring Anjali back into Rahul's life.

1118
01:29:44,566 --> 01:29:47,027
Bring Anjali back into your father's life.

1119
01:29:47,861 --> 01:29:51,949
Make my dream come true.

1120
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:09,550
Happy birthday. Gimme five, yeah. Sorry.

1121
01:30:35,868 --> 01:30:39,079
Yes, this is Malhotra speaking.
Using STD on my personal phone.

1122
01:30:39,621 --> 01:30:41,373
You're coming tomorrow, aren't you?

1123
01:30:41,498 --> 01:30:42,791
Yes, yes, definitely.

1124
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:45,794
As soon as we reach Delhi
we'll take a train to Faridabad.

1125
01:30:45,878 --> 01:30:47,254
Oh! The 4:00 train!

1126
01:30:47,337 --> 01:30:48,630
Yes, that one.

1127
01:30:48,714 --> 01:30:50,007
What're you doing?

1128
01:30:50,883 --> 01:30:52,051
Me?

1129
01:30:52,342 --> 01:30:54,511
I was dying my hair... Nothing.

1130
01:30:54,595 --> 01:30:56,388
No, no, sorry.
It wasn't meant for you.

1131
01:30:56,513 --> 01:30:57,973
These servants from Bombay are...

1132
01:30:58,057 --> 01:31:01,852
Okay then, I'll come tomorrow
to pick you up.

1133
01:31:02,102 --> 01:31:05,481
You'll come without fail, won't you?
Last time you forgot.

1134
01:31:05,564 --> 01:31:08,150
No, no, last time...
This time I'll definitely make it.

1135
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:13,697
And I will bring those essential items for
the death anniversary, don't you worry.

1136
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:16,075
-Okay then, I'll hang up now.
-So will I.

1137
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:23,165
Hi, guys.

1138
01:31:23,248 --> 01:31:26,794
This is Neelam and you're watching your
favorite show. The Neelam show.

1139
01:31:26,877 --> 01:31:29,713
We're going to do something
new in today's program.

1140
01:31:29,797 --> 01:31:31,256
We're going to play a game.

1141
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:33,884
Would you like to
play this game?

1142
01:31:36,428 --> 01:31:40,390
They say if you play this game,
your true feelings will come out.

1143
01:31:42,935 --> 01:31:44,019
I will say one word.

1144
01:31:44,103 --> 01:31:47,064
Say the first word that comes to mind
when I say it.

1145
01:31:47,147 --> 01:31:48,857
You will say it aloud,

1146
01:31:48,941 --> 01:31:52,402
but you won't be given any time to think.
Okay.

1147
01:31:53,445 --> 01:31:56,240
Okay, we'll start with you. Cloud.

1148
01:31:57,449 --> 01:31:58,575
Sorry! Time is up.

1149
01:31:58,826 --> 01:32:01,286
-Cloud. Okay.
-Rain.

1150
01:32:02,204 --> 01:32:05,290
-Beautiful. Hey, thanks.
-Neelam.

1151
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:08,293
-Heart.
-Love.

1152
01:32:08,627 --> 01:32:10,337
-Okay. Love.
-Seema.

1153
01:32:10,671 --> 01:32:12,172
What? You love me?

1154
01:32:14,133 --> 01:32:16,426
Hey guys, this game
really works.

1155
01:32:17,136 --> 01:32:21,265
Did you see how the true feelings
come out? Now you try this game.

1156
01:32:21,473 --> 01:32:23,934
We'll be back after a break.
Take a break.

1157
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:27,271
Stupid game.
Stupid Neelam.

1158
01:32:27,354 --> 01:32:29,565
Papa, don't call my Neelam stupid, okay.

1159
01:32:30,315 --> 01:32:32,776
Okay, I won't call your Neelam stupid.

1160
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:35,487
Come on, tell me quickly,
what is this game of yours?

1161
01:32:35,737 --> 01:32:38,699
Okay, papa, ready?
Start... Go...

1162
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:40,159
Sexy.

1163
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,493
Grandma.

1164
01:32:41,577 --> 01:32:43,871
-Shut up. Rogue.
-Papa, play seriously.

1165
01:32:43,954 --> 01:32:46,206
-Okay, I'll play seriously.
-Go ahead. Cloud.

1166
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,793
-Papa, you shouldn't take so much time.
-I'm drinking water, aren't I?

1167
01:32:49,877 --> 01:32:52,796
Okay, I won't waste any time.
Let's finally start the game. Tell me.

1168
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,173
-Cloud.
-Wind.

1169
01:32:54,339 --> 01:32:55,465
-Crazy.
-You.

1170
01:32:55,716 --> 01:32:56,842
-Home.
-Us.

1171
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:58,343
-Love.
-Friendship.

1172
01:32:58,552 --> 01:32:59,803
-Anjali.
-Sharma.

1173
01:33:00,721 --> 01:33:01,847
Sharma?

1174
01:33:03,724 --> 01:33:06,518
Who's this Anjali Sharma?

1175
01:33:08,604 --> 01:33:11,732
-Who is she?
-Nobody.

1176
01:33:11,899 --> 01:33:15,194
-Come on papa, it's my birthday.
-Okay, its your birthday.

1177
01:33:15,736 --> 01:33:17,863
Anjali Sharma was my college-mate.

1178
01:33:19,573 --> 01:33:20,574
In college?

1179
01:33:23,243 --> 01:33:24,369
She was my friend.

1180
01:33:24,703 --> 01:33:25,871
Friend.

1181
01:33:26,622 --> 01:33:29,625
-My best friend.
-But her name is very nice.

1182
01:33:29,917 --> 01:33:31,168
What did she look like?

1183
01:33:31,251 --> 01:33:32,878
Anjali.

1184
01:33:35,589 --> 01:33:37,382
She was unlike any other girls.

1185
01:33:38,967 --> 01:33:42,638
She was like... Us boys.

1186
01:33:46,308 --> 01:33:48,644
All the girls used to apply makeup.

1187
01:33:49,394 --> 01:33:54,024
And Anjali... And Anjali used to
play basketball.

1188
01:33:57,653 --> 01:34:00,030
And clothes, she used to wear
clothes like me.

1189
01:34:00,322 --> 01:34:01,240
Yes, seriously.

1190
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:06,370
My Anjali was very naughty.

1191
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,666
Putting on makeup, getting dressed
for occasions, looking beautiful,

1192
01:34:12,125 --> 01:34:13,752
she never knew any of that.

1193
01:34:17,464 --> 01:34:20,050
Is that enough or do you have
more questions?

1194
01:34:20,259 --> 01:34:21,426
Papa, where is she?

1195
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,304
I don't know.

1196
01:34:30,644 --> 01:34:34,439
Oh! I still can't believe
your getting engaged, Anjali.

1197
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:40,404
Listen, Guruji has come to finalize
your wedding date.

1198
01:34:40,612 --> 01:34:41,571
Yes.

1199
01:34:42,072 --> 01:34:43,073
Give me that.

1200
01:34:44,533 --> 01:34:46,201
How much more time will you take
to get dressed?

1201
01:34:46,285 --> 01:34:47,577
Aman is getting restless.

1202
01:34:47,953 --> 01:34:49,288
Tell him to wait.

1203
01:34:49,746 --> 01:34:51,957
This bride will take time.

1204
01:34:56,837 --> 01:35:00,507
Your groom has been waiting for long

1205
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:05,429
Don't delay anymore, come soon

1206
01:35:05,887 --> 01:35:10,892
Your groom has been waiting for long

1207
01:35:11,059 --> 01:35:15,188
Don't delay anymore, come soon

1208
01:35:25,949 --> 01:35:30,579
I've come to your house
To take you with me

1209
01:35:30,662 --> 01:35:35,125
To give my heart as a gift
In return for your heart

1210
01:35:35,459 --> 01:35:39,671
I've come to your house
To take you with me

1211
01:35:39,755 --> 01:35:45,260
To give my heart as a gift
In return for your heart

1212
01:35:45,344 --> 01:35:50,015
Listen to what my every heartbeat
Is saying

1213
01:35:50,223 --> 01:35:54,102
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

1214
01:35:55,103 --> 01:35:59,691
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

1215
01:36:09,743 --> 01:36:14,539
Oh, heart! Silly reasons
Will not work out anymore

1216
01:36:14,706 --> 01:36:19,252
The girl must go to
Her bridegroom's home

1217
01:36:19,628 --> 01:36:24,466
Listen to what the vermilion is saying?

1218
01:36:24,591 --> 01:36:29,054
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

1219
01:36:29,221 --> 01:36:34,017
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

1220
01:37:10,595 --> 01:37:15,267
I've fallen into the trap
Of a madman

1221
01:37:15,475 --> 01:37:19,771
How could I?
Tell me, my friends, tell me

1222
01:37:20,188 --> 01:37:25,026
Oh, dear! Even your friends are
Swooned over my style

1223
01:37:25,318 --> 01:37:29,656
What would they say?
Ask them, ask them

1224
01:37:30,115 --> 01:37:34,744
Go away, you liar
Why are you praising yourself?

1225
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:39,708
Go away, you liar
Why are you praising yourself?

1226
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:44,713
Listen to what your lover is saying

1227
01:37:44,796 --> 01:37:49,468
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

1228
01:37:49,634 --> 01:37:54,431
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

1229
01:38:33,803 --> 01:38:38,308
He's stupid and innocent
It's my benevolence

1230
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,771
To have accepted him
Tell him, tell him

1231
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:48,068
She's teasing me wantonly
In return for her benevolence

1232
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:52,697
I've given my heart to her, tell her
Tell her

1233
01:38:53,156 --> 01:38:57,577
You're ignorant, hearts do
Break sometimes, crazy man

1234
01:38:57,702 --> 01:39:03,041
You're ignorant, hearts do
Break sometimes, crazy man

1235
01:39:03,208 --> 01:39:08,213
Listen to what I am saying

1236
01:39:08,296 --> 01:39:12,676
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

1237
01:39:12,801 --> 01:39:16,930
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

1238
01:39:47,377 --> 01:39:51,548
Applying henna
Jewelry shining

1239
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:56,886
Applying henna
Jewelry shining

1240
01:39:57,053 --> 01:40:00,765
Crying and making everyone cry as well

1241
01:40:00,849 --> 01:40:03,768
You'll go away tomorrow

1242
01:40:03,852 --> 01:40:06,313
You'll make me miss you so much

1243
01:40:06,396 --> 01:40:10,984
You'll go away tomorrow
You'll make me miss you so much

1244
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:15,947
You'll make me miss you so much

1245
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:20,660
Applying henna
Jewelry shining

1246
01:40:20,785 --> 01:40:24,748
Applying henna
Jewelry shining

1247
01:40:24,956 --> 01:40:28,335
Crying and making everyone cry as well

1248
01:40:28,418 --> 01:40:32,964
You'll go away tomorrow

1249
01:40:33,048 --> 01:40:35,717
You'll make me miss you so much

1250
01:40:36,217 --> 01:40:40,597
You'll make me miss you so much

1251
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:45,060
You'll make me miss you so much

1252
01:40:50,482 --> 01:40:55,111
I've come to your house
To take you with me

1253
01:40:55,403 --> 01:40:59,741
To give my heart as a gift
In return for your heart

1254
01:41:00,158 --> 01:41:04,996
Listen to what my every heartbeat
Is saying

1255
01:41:05,163 --> 01:41:09,793
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

1256
01:41:09,959 --> 01:41:14,714
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

1257
01:41:14,839 --> 01:41:19,636
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

1258
01:41:19,803 --> 01:41:24,391
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

1259
01:42:01,177 --> 01:42:04,139
This is the old address.
Where can I get her new address?

1260
01:42:04,222 --> 01:42:06,349
Grandpa, can't you at least
do this for me?

1261
01:42:06,433 --> 01:42:09,144
-Of course I can.
-That's really very bad.

1262
01:42:09,519 --> 01:42:10,979
You're a principal
and you can't that even do that much?

1263
01:42:11,062 --> 01:42:13,898
Why are you bringing me being a principal
into this discussion?

1264
01:42:14,441 --> 01:42:15,525
One minute.

1265
01:42:17,736 --> 01:42:21,990
Where will Anjali Sharma be?
She'll definitely know.

1266
01:42:30,957 --> 01:42:32,500
Forgive me, Principal.

1267
01:42:33,334 --> 01:42:34,836
But I had promised Anjali

1268
01:42:35,086 --> 01:42:37,422
that I'll never reveal
her address to anyone.

1269
01:42:37,505 --> 01:42:39,340
We came with a lot of hope.

1270
01:42:40,049 --> 01:42:43,887
I can understand,
but my promise to Anjali...

1271
01:42:44,262 --> 01:42:47,599
Rifat Bi, I'm also Anjali.

1272
01:42:48,349 --> 01:42:49,768
Won't you tell me?

1273
01:42:54,272 --> 01:42:56,816
Principal, her engagement is today.

1274
01:42:57,567 --> 01:42:59,527
And she will get married this week.

1275
01:42:59,861 --> 01:43:01,863
Anjali's mother has faith in a guru.

1276
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:05,074
He's also going there today
to fix a date for the wedding.

1277
01:43:05,283 --> 01:43:06,659
You've come a little late.

1278
01:43:07,243 --> 01:43:11,831
I was planning to go by train
tomorrow afternoon.

1279
01:43:12,165 --> 01:43:15,502
The wedding will not happen.
My mother told me to...

1280
01:43:16,669 --> 01:43:18,171
It won't take place.

1281
01:43:19,798 --> 01:43:22,842
Guruji, we wanted
to fix a date for the wedding.

1282
01:43:22,926 --> 01:43:24,010
Yes.

1283
01:43:24,803 --> 01:43:27,722
-This is Aman's horoscope.
-Okay.

1284
01:43:28,139 --> 01:43:31,392
Aman wants to go back to London.

1285
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,854
Could you fix the date
for this month itself?

1286
01:43:35,897 --> 01:43:37,357
-This month?
-Yes.

1287
01:43:37,982 --> 01:43:40,860
Principal, if you had come
a little earlier, maybe I could...

1288
01:43:40,985 --> 01:43:42,403
Yes, but we didn't know.

1289
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:10,932
I don't know why, but Anjali may be
experiencing an unlucky period,

1290
01:44:11,015 --> 01:44:14,018
and until that unlucky period elapses,
you can't get her married.

1291
01:44:20,567 --> 01:44:23,987
-Then next month?
-Next month is also not suitable.

1292
01:44:30,326 --> 01:44:32,954
Anjali's wedding can't be fixed
before December.

1293
01:44:44,757 --> 01:44:45,717
Hello!

1294
01:44:58,438 --> 01:45:00,064
I have heard about God's miracles,

1295
01:45:01,608 --> 01:45:02,817
but today I have actually seen one.

1296
01:45:03,818 --> 01:45:05,737
The child's prayers have been answered.

1297
01:45:06,321 --> 01:45:09,032
Anjali can't get married before December.

1298
01:45:16,581 --> 01:45:17,582
Can I ask you something?

1299
01:45:18,166 --> 01:45:19,125
Yes.

1300
01:45:20,793 --> 01:45:21,836
Are you happy?

1301
01:45:28,301 --> 01:45:30,929
What kind of question is that?
Of course I'm happy.

1302
01:45:32,764 --> 01:45:36,434
I'm engaged. Aman is a good man.

1303
01:45:38,269 --> 01:45:39,437
He loves me very much.

1304
01:45:40,605 --> 01:45:42,732
-And he's...
-But do you love him?

1305
01:45:48,571 --> 01:45:49,405
Anjali.

1306
01:45:56,287 --> 01:46:00,625
I have already loved mom.

1307
01:46:03,086 --> 01:46:04,921
Maybe I can't fall in love again.

1308
01:46:07,966 --> 01:46:12,971
-Just think of this as a compromise.
-Compromise?

1309
01:46:15,765 --> 01:46:21,312
I never thought that my daughter would
marry out of compromise and not love.

1310
01:46:23,356 --> 01:46:24,399
I'm also a mother.

1311
01:46:25,358 --> 01:46:27,110
I want you to be happy.

1312
01:46:27,819 --> 01:46:29,278
To start your own home.

1313
01:46:30,697 --> 01:46:34,784
But a home based on a compromise,

1314
01:46:35,702 --> 01:46:39,414
is a house, not a home.

1315
01:46:43,292 --> 01:46:44,502
The rest is upto you.

1316
01:47:25,668 --> 01:47:27,920
Oh! I can't handle this religious stuff...

1317
01:47:30,131 --> 01:47:31,132
I can.

1318
01:47:32,133 --> 01:47:35,178
Today Guruji is going to chant
hymns and read the sacred book.

1319
01:47:35,386 --> 01:47:37,430
Wow! Amazing. Amazing.

1320
01:47:37,805 --> 01:47:38,681
This Guruji...

1321
01:47:39,682 --> 01:47:42,185
Why? He postponed the wedding.

1322
01:47:43,311 --> 01:47:45,438
I can't handle this anymore.

1323
01:47:45,646 --> 01:47:48,691
-Even God gets fed up with so many hymns.
-Why?

1324
01:47:48,775 --> 01:47:52,653
-Don't you want to ask God for something?
-What should I ask for? I've got you.

1325
01:47:52,737 --> 01:47:57,617
Now, I think if we have a few children...
And I'm afraid God can't help with that.

1326
01:47:57,825 --> 01:47:59,619
-Whatever it is, I've to do it myself.
-Behave yourself.

1327
01:47:59,702 --> 01:48:03,164
Hey, Aman... Aman.

1328
01:48:03,664 --> 01:48:05,249
Good morning...
Good morning.

1329
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:08,252
I saw you this morning
in the courtyard, topless.

1330
01:48:08,419 --> 01:48:11,089
-Exercising, what else...
-What are you saying?

1331
01:48:11,923 --> 01:48:15,802
-Hey, fatty... Youth in old age.
-Hey, shut up.

1332
01:48:16,177 --> 01:48:17,553
You are be old.

1333
01:48:18,012 --> 01:48:20,431
Hey, don't tease him.

1334
01:48:20,681 --> 01:48:23,976
What a handsome boy!
Don't you have a brother?

1335
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,103
What are you saying?

1336
01:48:25,186 --> 01:48:27,980
-My Gurpreet is also very pretty.
-What are you saying?

1337
01:48:29,023 --> 01:48:29,982
Forget Gurpreet.

1338
01:48:30,525 --> 01:48:33,444
My Jaspreet is Miss Chandigarh.

1339
01:48:34,070 --> 01:48:37,698
Ms. Chandigarh or Ms. Sector 11.

1340
01:48:38,449 --> 01:48:42,161
Okay come on now, Guruji has started.

1341
01:48:42,495 --> 01:48:44,122
-Greetings!
-Okay, bye Aman.

1342
01:48:45,498 --> 01:48:46,749
Come.

1343
01:48:46,833 --> 01:48:49,085
Anjali, there is a call for you.

1344
01:48:49,752 --> 01:48:50,753
Excuse me.

1345
01:48:51,379 --> 01:48:53,047
Thank you so much,
mother-in-law.

1346
01:48:53,297 --> 01:48:54,298
Welcome, son-in-law.

1347
01:48:55,091 --> 01:48:57,051
Hello? Hello?

1348
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:02,890
-Hello?
-Hello?

1349
01:49:03,182 --> 01:49:04,267
I love you.

1350
01:49:05,518 --> 01:49:06,352
Aman...

1351
01:49:07,979 --> 01:49:10,523
-I have a small problem.
-What?

1352
01:49:11,524 --> 01:49:13,526
Don't leave me like this.

1353
01:49:13,901 --> 01:49:16,154
Aman, don't know who's on the line?

1354
01:49:16,904 --> 01:49:19,824
And anyway you are going to
Shimla for your summer camp.

1355
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:22,368
You're also going to Bombay.

1356
01:49:22,451 --> 01:49:24,912
For 24 hours only
and you're going for a month.

1357
01:49:25,246 --> 01:49:29,625
Aman, I go there every year
to teach singing and dancing.

1358
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:32,253
Now those children have become
a part of my life.

1359
01:49:32,336 --> 01:49:35,298
Okay. They've also become
a part of your life.

1360
01:49:36,048 --> 01:49:37,925
Only I'm left.

1361
01:49:39,886 --> 01:49:40,720
Hello?

1362
01:49:43,097 --> 01:49:45,308
Why do I get the feeling,
you don't love me?

1363
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:47,685
Because I don't.

1364
01:49:48,227 --> 01:49:51,689
-And you don't want to marry me?
-Right, I don't want to.

1365
01:49:53,941 --> 01:49:55,902
Hey! Any tantrums this time...

1366
01:49:56,319 --> 01:49:59,238
...and l'll drag you by the
hand to the marriage pandal.

1367
01:49:59,405 --> 01:50:00,781
You'll force me?

1368
01:50:01,949 --> 01:50:03,075
If need be.

1369
01:50:04,619 --> 01:50:06,162
You have the guts to do it?

1370
01:50:07,747 --> 01:50:08,581
Try me.

1371
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:13,002
I'll stay with your aunts.

1372
01:50:13,377 --> 01:50:15,630
You go to Shimla for your Summer Camp.

1373
01:50:16,339 --> 01:50:17,173
Summer camp?

1374
01:50:19,383 --> 01:50:20,218
Shimla.

1375
01:50:20,551 --> 01:50:23,221
What?
What? Summer camp? In Shimla?

1376
01:50:23,846 --> 01:50:26,807
No, no, no.
You're not going to any summer camp.

1377
01:50:26,974 --> 01:50:29,769
-No way. Too much snow there.
-Papa, it's a summer camp.

1378
01:50:29,852 --> 01:50:32,021
Whatever it may be,
you're not going there.

1379
01:50:32,104 --> 01:50:33,606
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

1380
01:50:33,898 --> 01:50:35,900
Papa, they teach singing
and dancing there.

1381
01:50:36,108 --> 01:50:38,861
And you also know how much
I like to sing and dance.

1382
01:50:39,111 --> 01:50:40,821
When did you start liking
singing and dancing?

1383
01:50:40,905 --> 01:50:43,407
I said no. "No" means no.
That's all.

1384
01:50:44,075 --> 01:50:45,368
Papa, it's not fair.

1385
01:50:45,576 --> 01:50:51,415
-Let her go, son.
-Mom, I'll handle this, okay.

1386
01:50:52,959 --> 01:50:56,587
But, Rahul, try to understand. Why can't
she go? I'll go with her.

1387
01:50:56,754 --> 01:51:01,259
-Papa, I want to go.
-No, Anjali. No.

1388
01:51:01,467 --> 01:51:03,261
-She'll enjoy-
-Shut up!

1389
01:51:04,345 --> 01:51:07,390
When I have said no, then no one
is allowed to go! No need to argue!

1390
01:51:07,765 --> 01:51:09,725
None of you will go
to the summer camp!

1391
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:13,479
All right! Okay! You understand that?

1392
01:51:16,190 --> 01:51:17,024
Good.

1393
01:51:31,872 --> 01:51:32,999
You felt bad?

1394
01:51:35,501 --> 01:51:36,335
I'm sorry.

1395
01:51:38,921 --> 01:51:40,506
-It's okay.
-Okay.

1396
01:51:43,092 --> 01:51:46,345
But this does not mean that you're
going to the summer camp, okay?

1397
01:51:46,429 --> 01:51:48,180
From now on, no one is allowed
to talk about the summer camp.

1398
01:51:48,264 --> 01:51:51,142
I'm going to the conference,
we'll talk after I come back.

1399
01:51:51,225 --> 01:51:53,060
-Papa?
-What is it?

1400
01:51:53,728 --> 01:51:55,479
You haven't worn your pants.

1401
01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:02,445
I don't want to wear it.
Wear it if you want to.

1402
01:52:14,498 --> 01:52:15,624
What is it?

1403
01:52:19,337 --> 01:52:21,380
Driver take out the pant... the car.

1404
01:52:25,176 --> 01:52:30,264
Anjali... How will we make
your father come to the camp?

1405
01:52:30,348 --> 01:52:31,557
Come on, Grandma.

1406
01:52:31,849 --> 01:52:35,561
Do you remember when I was four years old
and Dad was in London?

1407
01:52:35,644 --> 01:52:38,356
And I was down with a cold and a cough.

1408
01:52:38,564 --> 01:52:39,523
Yes, my dear.

1409
01:52:40,024 --> 01:52:43,152
Grandma, papa left everything
and came back immediately.

1410
01:52:43,569 --> 01:52:44,779
Then...

1411
01:52:53,954 --> 01:52:56,749
Look, according to me this export policy
is not going to hold much water.

1412
01:52:57,249 --> 01:53:00,336
-Sorry.
-Don't worry. It's okay.

1413
01:53:00,503 --> 01:53:02,713
Look every expert is going
to ask himself...

1414
01:53:04,882 --> 01:53:07,093
Indian exporter's conference.
Good evening.

1415
01:53:07,176 --> 01:53:09,220
Hello, may I speak with
Aman Mehra please?

1416
01:53:09,303 --> 01:53:11,347
-Whom shall I say is calling?
-Anjali.

1417
01:53:11,555 --> 01:53:12,848
Anjali, right.

1418
01:53:15,518 --> 01:53:17,770
Indian exporter's conference.
Good evening.

1419
01:53:17,853 --> 01:53:20,022
-Hello! Can I speak to papa?
-"Papa"?

1420
01:53:20,189 --> 01:53:22,733
Your father's not a film star.
Tell her his name.

1421
01:53:22,817 --> 01:53:23,901
Yes, I'm sorry.

1422
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:26,695
Hello, may I speak to
Mr. Rahul Khanna please?

1423
01:53:26,862 --> 01:53:28,864
-Whom shall I say is calling?
-Anjali.

1424
01:53:29,281 --> 01:53:30,366
Certainly, Anjali.

1425
01:53:31,534 --> 01:53:32,660
Anjali.

1426
01:53:33,661 --> 01:53:36,789
Quickly tell him we're going
and put the phone down.

1427
01:53:37,289 --> 01:53:40,501
Tracing Mr. Rahul Khanna,
Mr. Aman Mehra. Call for you please.

1428
01:53:41,419 --> 01:53:42,837
Hi! Rahul Khanna...

1429
01:53:45,423 --> 01:53:46,841
-Booth 2, yeah!
-Sure.

1430
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,261
-Sorry.
-It's alright.

1431
01:53:50,344 --> 01:53:51,387
Take care.

1432
01:53:51,887 --> 01:53:53,180
Hi, sweetheart.

1433
01:53:53,681 --> 01:53:55,266
-Hello...
-Hello...

1434
01:53:55,474 --> 01:53:56,725
-Hello?
-Speak...

1435
01:53:56,934 --> 01:53:58,602
I can't hear anything.

1436
01:53:58,686 --> 01:54:00,729
I can hear you. Tell me, what is it?

1437
01:54:01,021 --> 01:54:02,314
Hi, sweetheart.

1438
01:54:03,691 --> 01:54:05,192
I'm really missing you.

1439
01:54:07,945 --> 01:54:10,656
Listen, I'm off to the camp tomorrow.

1440
01:54:10,739 --> 01:54:11,740
Where?

1441
01:54:11,824 --> 01:54:14,034
-Summer camp.
-Again summer camp?

1442
01:54:14,243 --> 01:54:16,829
I have told you once not to go,
so you're not going.

1443
01:54:17,121 --> 01:54:19,373
Okay, listen. I'm feeling very...

1444
01:54:21,167 --> 01:54:22,168
Give me a kiss.

1445
01:54:22,710 --> 01:54:24,378
This is your mother speaking.

1446
01:54:24,837 --> 01:54:26,630
I don't like such jokes.

1447
01:54:26,755 --> 01:54:28,215
It has been 10 years
since my mother died.

1448
01:54:28,507 --> 01:54:31,385
Oh, my God! Why is he killing me
when I am alive?

1449
01:54:31,469 --> 01:54:33,929
No summer camp...
Do you understand that?

1450
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:35,931
Aman, why are you shouting?

1451
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:38,893
I'm shouting because I have
already told you not to go to summer camp.

1452
01:54:39,101 --> 01:54:41,270
Listen, if you ever talk
about summer camp again,

1453
01:54:41,479 --> 01:54:43,522
I will come home and slap you.

1454
01:54:43,606 --> 01:54:45,316
Aman, you've gone mad.

1455
01:54:48,152 --> 01:54:48,986
Anjali...

1456
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:51,739
Your father has gone mad.

1457
01:54:53,532 --> 01:54:54,366
Anjali?

1458
01:54:56,535 --> 01:54:58,704
-Anjali.
-Anjali.

1459
01:54:59,705 --> 01:55:00,748
Yeah, Anjali.

1460
01:55:02,666 --> 01:55:04,001
Confusion.

1461
01:55:04,084 --> 01:55:06,545
-Hi! I'm Rahul Khanna.
-Aman Mehra, how're you doing?

1462
01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:09,298
I think she got confused
because names were the same.

1463
01:55:09,381 --> 01:55:13,552
But I'm sure my Anjali is
way more beautiful than yours.

1464
01:55:14,386 --> 01:55:16,889
-No. My Anjali is very beautiful.
-Maybe.

1465
01:55:17,056 --> 01:55:19,600
But she can't be more beautiful
than my Anjali.

1466
01:55:20,017 --> 01:55:23,354
-My Anjali is my eight-year-old daughter.
-Oh, shit.

1467
01:55:23,479 --> 01:55:25,856
Then your Anjali will be more beautiful
than mine.

1468
01:55:25,981 --> 01:55:27,441
Anyway best of luck
with your Anjali.

1469
01:55:27,566 --> 01:55:28,859
Best of luck to you too.

1470
01:55:28,984 --> 01:55:30,486
-Bye take care.
-Bye take care.

1471
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:35,533
Dear Papa,
sorry we left without informing you.

1472
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:40,371
But you know that I like
singing and dancing very much.

1473
01:55:40,871 --> 01:55:42,706
But I'm really sorry, Papa.

1474
01:55:42,831 --> 01:55:44,792
Don't miss me too much, okay?

1475
01:55:45,251 --> 01:55:46,544
Love you, Anjali.

1476
01:55:47,545 --> 01:55:48,796
I can't do that.

1477
01:55:50,714 --> 01:55:51,549
Anjali.

1478
01:55:52,591 --> 01:55:56,428
Good morning kids, welcome
to camp sunshine.

1479
01:55:56,845 --> 01:55:59,848
I am Colonel Almeida,
manager of this camp,

1480
01:56:00,057 --> 01:56:03,185
I will note down your height and weight.
Okay?

1481
01:56:03,769 --> 01:56:06,981
Twenty-four, very nice.
Eat fruits. Eat food.

1482
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:10,693
That's good. Thirty, very nice. Very nice.

1483
01:56:11,569 --> 01:56:12,778
80, very...

1484
01:56:13,362 --> 01:56:14,405
Who is this child?

1485
01:56:17,324 --> 01:56:19,994
-Who're you?
-Me? I'm a grandma.

1486
01:56:20,369 --> 01:56:23,622
-Whose grandma?
-Anjali's grandma, and who're you?

1487
01:56:24,707 --> 01:56:27,251
-I'm the manager of this camp.
-Hello.

1488
01:56:27,459 --> 01:56:31,547
Hello. Listen, no mummy, daddy,
grandma allowed into this camp.

1489
01:56:31,839 --> 01:56:32,881
Oh, really!

1490
01:56:32,965 --> 01:56:35,843
So I should've let Anjali
come here alone?

1491
01:56:35,926 --> 01:56:36,844
What?

1492
01:56:37,761 --> 01:56:40,764
Have you seen Ms. Anjali? Ms. Anjali?

1493
01:56:42,349 --> 01:56:44,602
What's it? What's it?

1494
01:56:51,817 --> 01:56:56,697
The British flag in my India?
I'll see to this right now.

1495
01:56:58,032 --> 01:56:58,907
One minute.

1496
01:56:59,533 --> 01:57:01,493
-Almeida.
-Go... Go... Go...

1497
01:57:01,869 --> 01:57:02,911
What's it?

1498
01:57:03,162 --> 01:57:07,249
Aren't you ashamed?
You've hoisted the British flag.

1499
01:57:08,334 --> 01:57:13,839
I love England. My father was a tailor
during the British rule.

1500
01:57:14,757 --> 01:57:17,551
It was him who stitched this flag,
you know.

1501
01:57:17,635 --> 01:57:19,637
The British are gone, but left Almeida.

1502
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,180
-That's good.
-You are shameless!

1503
01:57:21,263 --> 01:57:24,558
You must teach children
that India is great.

1504
01:57:24,767 --> 01:57:26,393
Yeah. Who's Bharat?

1505
01:58:13,482 --> 01:58:15,275
-Here you go?
-Thank you.

1506
01:58:16,193 --> 01:58:17,945
Hey, what's your name?

1507
01:58:20,406 --> 01:58:22,282
Sorry.

1508
01:58:23,784 --> 01:58:25,661
-What's your name?
-Anjali.

1509
01:58:25,911 --> 01:58:27,913
That's my name too. Hi.

1510
01:58:29,123 --> 01:58:30,791
Why is your name Anjali?

1511
01:58:33,460 --> 01:58:37,047
Maybe my parents liked this name.
That's why.

1512
01:58:37,339 --> 01:58:38,632
Why is your name Anjali?

1513
01:58:39,007 --> 01:58:42,136
Maybe my parents liked you.

1514
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:50,394
Where is Almeida?

1515
01:58:59,737 --> 01:59:00,612
Greetings.

1516
01:59:10,998 --> 01:59:11,832
Almeida.

1517
01:59:16,253 --> 01:59:20,048
-I need your blessings, mother.
-Almeida.

1518
01:59:20,132 --> 01:59:22,968
Stop following me.

1519
01:59:23,051 --> 01:59:24,678
Tell me, where is the kitchen?

1520
01:59:25,053 --> 01:59:27,055
I want to see how you cook?

1521
01:59:27,639 --> 01:59:29,433
And where is the prayer room?

1522
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:31,393
Pooja has not come for duty today.

1523
01:59:32,519 --> 01:59:35,314
I mean prayer
as in offering prayers to God.

1524
01:59:35,397 --> 01:59:37,816
Oh, madam,
we don't offer such amenities here.

1525
01:59:38,233 --> 01:59:39,234
What?

1526
01:59:39,318 --> 01:59:41,820
Don't you offer prayers to God
early in the morning?

1527
01:59:41,904 --> 01:59:44,364
-Aarthi, who is Aarthi?
-Almeida!

1528
01:59:56,251 --> 01:59:57,836
Are you counting the stars?

1529
02:00:02,132 --> 02:00:03,634
Are you counting the stars?

1530
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,222
Doesn't speak.

1531
02:00:10,766 --> 02:00:13,060
-Good night, Mr. Almeida.
-Good night darling.

1532
02:00:13,268 --> 02:00:16,230
London bridge is falling down
Falling down

1533
02:00:35,749 --> 02:00:37,584
Dear God, how're you?

1534
02:00:39,044 --> 02:00:40,587
Please keep my daddy happy.

1535
02:00:40,796 --> 02:00:43,799
And see to it
that he doesn't miss me too much.

1536
02:00:44,007 --> 02:00:48,887
You know that he can't do anything
without me. Please. Okay?

1537
02:00:49,388 --> 02:00:50,389
Caught you.

1538
02:00:51,974 --> 02:00:54,101
Oh, Miss Anjali. Hi.

1539
02:00:55,978 --> 02:00:59,189
All prayers for papa?
Nothing for mum?

1540
02:00:59,398 --> 02:01:02,317
What can I ask God for mum?

1541
02:01:02,609 --> 02:01:04,403
-Why?
-She is with him.

1542
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:07,406
Whatever she wants,
she can ask for it herself.

1543
02:01:17,833 --> 02:01:18,792
Hey.

1544
02:01:19,376 --> 02:01:22,713
Now go to sleep, okay.
Sweet dreams.

1545
02:01:29,761 --> 02:01:30,596
Miss you, papa.

1546
02:01:31,179 --> 02:01:32,097
Stand by.

1547
02:01:33,015 --> 02:01:33,974
Roll camera.

1548
02:01:35,017 --> 02:01:36,393
Crane up.

1549
02:01:40,063 --> 02:01:42,316
Hi guys, welcome to
The Neelam show.

1550
02:01:42,608 --> 02:01:45,235
Tonight we're coming to you
live from the docks.

1551
02:01:45,527 --> 02:01:47,988
Oh God! There's so much
noise here today.

1552
02:01:48,363 --> 02:01:49,990
You must check it out yourself.

1553
02:02:04,379 --> 02:02:05,797
Hi, guys! This is Neelam.

1554
02:02:05,881 --> 02:02:08,675
And you're watching your favorite
show The Neelam Show.

1555
02:02:08,926 --> 02:02:12,262
As usual, we'll be doing something
new and different.

1556
02:02:12,471 --> 02:02:15,849
The theme of the show today
is "love messages."

1557
02:02:17,893 --> 02:02:20,187
Okay messages...
Messages.

1558
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:22,230
I've a message...
I've a message.

1559
02:02:22,314 --> 02:02:24,274
-We've someone.
-I've a message okay.

1560
02:02:24,483 --> 02:02:26,777
-Who is your message for?
-Suparna.

1561
02:02:27,319 --> 02:02:29,279
-Who is Suparna?
-My girlfriend.

1562
02:02:32,699 --> 02:02:33,825
What is the message?

1672
02:11:47,045 --> 02:11:48,254
Good night, Rahul.

1673
02:11:50,632 --> 02:11:51,841
Goodnight...

1674
02:12:01,142 --> 02:12:02,393
Goodnight.

1675
02:12:12,153 --> 02:12:14,948
-What's the news?
-Very bad news, Grandma.

1676
02:12:15,031 --> 02:12:17,742
They both behaved as if they were
strangers meeting for the first time.

1677
02:12:17,825 --> 02:12:19,953
Good night, Rahul.
Good night, Anjali.

1678
02:12:20,286 --> 02:12:22,413
-What do we do now?
-What do we do now?

1679
02:12:26,167 --> 02:12:30,296
-Do you have any ideas?
-Idea?

1680
02:12:32,715 --> 02:12:36,344
Prayer is the answer, child.

1681
02:12:36,427 --> 02:12:38,221
Come on, Grandma!

1682
02:12:38,513 --> 02:12:42,517
What do we do? You tell me what to do!

1683
02:12:50,483 --> 02:12:51,609
Yes...

1684
02:12:52,777 --> 02:12:56,239
I won't let go of you!
I'll kill you!

1685
02:12:56,990 --> 02:12:59,075
What are you doing?
Have you gone insane?

1686
02:12:59,284 --> 02:13:00,201
Stop it.

1687
02:13:00,285 --> 02:13:01,995
Is this what I have taught you?

1688
02:13:02,078 --> 02:13:04,205
Stop it, Rohan. Big boys don't fight.
She's a girl.

1689
02:13:04,581 --> 02:13:06,666
-Why are you fighting?
-He hit me first.

1690
02:13:06,791 --> 02:13:10,253
I said girls can play
basketball and he said...

1691
02:13:10,336 --> 02:13:12,422
Girls can't play basketball.

1692
02:13:12,505 --> 02:13:14,465
He told you the truth and
you started fighting with him?

1693
02:13:14,549 --> 02:13:17,844
Didn't you lose to Anjali in basketball?

1694
02:13:17,927 --> 02:13:20,013
Keep quiet. Shut up.

1695
02:13:21,055 --> 02:13:24,475
Not every day. Only sometimes
I used to lose, okay. Yeah.

1696
02:13:24,559 --> 02:13:26,686
Rahul, you used to lose every day.

1697
02:13:26,769 --> 02:13:29,480

but you used to lose every day.

1698
02:13:29,564 --> 02:13:30,773
Rahul, you used to lose every day.

1699

1701
02:13:35,528 --> 02:13:39,032
-What? Am I lying?
-Am I lying, you liar?

1702
02:13:40,033 --> 02:13:44,787
-The fact is, you used to cheat and win.
-Don't call me a cheater, okay?

1703
02:13:44,871 --> 02:13:48,166
That's what you are, cheater
cheater, cheater.

1704
02:13:48,249 --> 02:13:49,709
Anjali, don't call me a cheater.

1705
02:13:49,792 --> 02:13:54,255
Rahul is a cheater
He's a cheater

1706
02:13:54,339 --> 02:13:56,049
-Don't listen to her.
-Cheater!

1707
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,259

Okay... Okay...
I'm alright, okay...

I challenge you right now.
Play with me.

02:14:16,569 --> 02:14:18,655
Don't be silly.
Anjali, yeah.

1711
02:14:19,739 --> 02:14:22,700
Why? Are you scared? Rahul.

1712

1713
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:33,086
-We'll see.
-We'll see.

1714
02:14:36,756 --> 02:14:40,051

02:14:50,561 --> 02:14:54,565
Rahul! Rahul! Rahul!

1717
02:15:08,830 --> 02:15:10,289
You are going to lose again, Rahul.

1718
02:15:11,624 --> 02:15:14,752
I'm practicing for the last
eight years. I won't lose.

1719
02:15:17,839 --> 02:15:21,008
Listen, take care of your sari.

-Shut up.

1721
02:15:46,284 --> 02:15:48,035
Oh, you can't... Yeah.

1722
02:15:55,668 --> 02:15:57,962

Come on, come on, try, yeah.

1724
02:16:20,234 --> 02:16:22,695

Cheater.

1732
02:17:26,259 --> 02:17:28,553
Girls can't play basketball.

1733
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:32,515
Girls can't play basketball...

1734
02:17:37,770 --> 02:17:40,398
Hey, give it to me.
Hey, look at the loser.

1735
02:18:48,507 --> 02:18:52,303
There is a strange girl

1736
02:18:52,511 --> 02:18:56,140
She is a dream
Is she for real or a story

1737
02:18:56,390 --> 02:18:59,852
Look at this mad one
She's not changed

1738
02:19:00,353 --> 02:19:03,648
She is still the same crazy one

1739
02:19:12,281 --> 02:19:15,910
There is a strange boy

1740
02:19:16,202 --> 02:19:19,997
He is a dream
Is he for real or a story?

1741
02:19:20,206 --> 02:19:23,668
Look at this mad one
He's not changed

1742
02:19:24,210 --> 02:19:27,338
He is still the same crazy one

1743
02:20:16,053 --> 02:20:19,682
We were close and yet so far

1744
02:20:19,932 --> 02:20:23,227
Those were strange circumstance

1745
02:20:23,978 --> 02:20:27,273
Those were strange times

1746
02:20:27,606 --> 02:20:31,235
When you were so close

1747
02:20:31,777 --> 02:20:35,448
Where are you lost?

1748
02:20:35,531 --> 02:20:38,743
I'm right here if only you would look

1749
02:21:53,067 --> 02:21:56,904
I was lonesome even in a crowd

1750
02:21:57,238 --> 02:22:00,533
You were forever in my memory

1751
02:22:01,075 --> 02:22:05,079
If someone stops me now

1752
02:22:05,162 --> 02:22:08,082
My heart will brim over

1753
02:22:09,041 --> 02:22:12,837
I can't stand steady

1754
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:16,006
Only you can help now

1755
02:22:24,598 --> 02:22:28,227
There is a strange girl

1756
02:22:28,644 --> 02:22:32,439
She is a dream
Is she for real or a story

1757
02:22:32,731 --> 02:22:35,985
Look at this mad one
He's not changed

1758
02:22:36,735 --> 02:22:39,864
He is still the same crazy one

1759
02:23:13,147 --> 02:23:18,360
You gave me dreams

1760
02:23:24,408 --> 02:23:28,329
I am neither awake nor asleep

1761
02:23:31,999 --> 02:23:35,127
Something is happening

1762
02:23:40,049 --> 02:23:43,135
Something is happening

1763
02:23:43,677 --> 02:23:47,306
Something is happening

1764
02:23:47,514 --> 02:23:50,100
Something is happening

1765
02:23:51,143 --> 02:23:54,980
Okay, Nikhil, here's your letter.
And, Mamta, here's yours.

1766
02:23:55,814 --> 02:23:59,944
Okay, kids, listen. All the mothers are
complaining that no one is replying.

1767
02:24:00,194 --> 02:24:03,656
And I've complained to your mother
that you're not saying anything.

1768
02:24:03,822 --> 02:24:07,618
Okay, stop that drawing, stop drawing
Stop drawing, okay.

1769
02:24:08,077 --> 02:24:11,163
All of you will write letters
to your moms, okay?

1770
02:24:11,330 --> 02:24:14,959
Come on, start. Pass it down.
Pass it down.

1771
02:24:15,125 --> 02:24:17,336
Anjali, you also write to your mom.

1772
02:24:50,244 --> 02:24:51,870
If you were here today,

1773
02:24:52,663 --> 02:24:56,875
you could've proudly said that
Anjali is definitely your daughter.

1774
02:25:00,421 --> 02:25:02,214
Because she's very nice.

1775
02:25:05,259 --> 02:25:08,220
And why not?
Her name is Anjali.

1776
02:25:13,225 --> 02:25:17,062
And do you know what's best about her?

1777
02:25:19,398 --> 02:25:21,275
She's exactly like you.

1778
02:25:24,028 --> 02:25:27,698
Same eyes, same face.

1779
02:25:30,409 --> 02:25:31,744
She's just like you.

1780
02:25:49,803 --> 02:25:55,100
Now, I don't feel like
this family is incomplete...

1781
02:25:57,311 --> 02:26:03,233
Hi kids, good morning.
Are you ready? Say cheese.

1782
02:26:05,944 --> 02:26:08,197
Oh, no, you're taking a photograph,
without me?

1783
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:11,158
-Okay, I'll also join you.
-Oh, God!

1784
02:26:11,658 --> 02:26:15,287
-Hello, Mr. Almeida.
-Hello.

1785
02:26:15,579 --> 02:26:18,332
-I look nice, don't I? My sari.
-Very pretty.

1786
02:26:18,415 --> 02:26:20,751
-Shall I sit here?
-Please come, sit.

1787
02:26:22,127 --> 02:26:25,964
-No, not there, a little higher.
-Higher?

1788
02:26:27,508 --> 02:26:31,678
-Not there, a little higher.
-Where are you sending me?

1789
02:26:31,762 --> 02:26:33,764
He is planning to send me
right up to heaven.

1790
02:26:33,847 --> 02:26:36,141
-A little higher.
-Okay.

1791
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,394
-Shall I sit here?
-Okay.

1792
02:26:40,229 --> 02:26:41,605
How do I look?

1793
02:26:41,688 --> 02:26:45,317
-You're fantastic, beautiful.
-Thank you.

1794
02:26:45,692 --> 02:26:47,653
-Okay, ready. I'm ready.
-That's good.

1795
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:53,242
Okay, one, two, cheese.

1796
02:26:53,325 --> 02:26:55,619
Fantastic...

1797
02:26:56,161 --> 02:26:58,247
Yeah!

1798
02:27:02,167 --> 02:27:05,504
That's good. Hold it please.

1799
02:27:06,964 --> 02:27:08,549
What happened, Mr. Almeda?

1800
02:27:08,715 --> 02:27:13,303
Oh, no. I don't know. Something missing.
Something's wrong.

1801
02:27:16,557 --> 02:27:17,683
Is it okay now?

1802
02:27:24,857 --> 02:27:26,984
It's perfect. Take it.

1803
02:27:33,073 --> 02:27:36,368
Please excuse me.
Now just the two of you.

1804
02:27:37,035 --> 02:27:40,164
Thank you very much.
Now a little closer.

1805
02:27:42,541 --> 02:27:44,793
Enough, Mr. Almeda. We're done.

1806
02:27:45,127 --> 02:27:48,922
-Anjali, take one.
-Please, come on.

1807
02:27:49,047 --> 02:27:51,175
Colonel, Colonel, no please.

1808
02:27:51,258 --> 02:27:52,426
Hey, come on Anjali.

1809
02:27:52,759 --> 02:27:55,971
Rahul, Anjali! Rahul, Anjali!

1810
02:27:56,597 --> 02:27:57,431
Come on.

1811
02:28:02,352 --> 02:28:04,438
Look at this mother-in-law,
wow.

1812
02:28:05,397 --> 02:28:09,359
How can someone look so good?
Too good, too good.

1813
02:28:09,443 --> 02:28:12,154
Anjali is looking smashing
in this photo, isn't she?

1814
02:28:12,237 --> 02:28:16,492
-Really? I didn't see her.
-Save it. I know everything.

1815
02:28:16,575 --> 02:28:20,037
She isn't here. You're pleasing yourself
by looking at her photos.

1816
02:28:20,245 --> 02:28:21,872
What can I do, Mother-in-law.

1817
02:28:22,372 --> 02:28:25,167
Aman, the wedding is scheduled
for December, isn't it?

1818
02:28:25,375 --> 02:28:27,169
Why don't you go to London and come back?

1819
02:28:27,252 --> 02:28:30,255
-No. I'm not going anywhere.
-Why?

1820
02:28:31,131 --> 02:28:33,842
Because I don't trust your daughter
at all.

1821
02:28:34,009 --> 02:28:36,845
She's taken forever,
to agree for the marriage.

1822
02:28:37,054 --> 02:28:38,847
Till the circle...
what do you call them?

1823
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:39,848
Tie the knot.

1824
02:28:39,932 --> 02:28:43,227
Unitl we tie the knot,
I'm not going anywhere.

1825
02:28:43,810 --> 02:28:44,728
Mad fellow!

1826
02:28:44,937 --> 02:28:48,607
-You love her a lot don't you?
-No. Yes.

1827
02:28:51,527 --> 02:28:54,655
But I think...

1828
02:28:55,614 --> 02:28:57,908
She doesn't love me.

1829
02:29:01,870 --> 02:29:04,373
She doesn't love me.

1830
02:29:07,084 --> 02:29:10,754
Hey, Mother-in-law, she doesn't, right?

1831
02:29:12,464 --> 02:29:15,259
Aman, you've gone mad.

1832
02:29:22,975 --> 02:29:23,934
She didn't answer.

1833
02:29:25,018 --> 02:29:28,772
Today we are going to play
a new game called charades.

1834
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:33,068
There are two teams
in this game. Team A.

1835
02:29:33,986 --> 02:29:35,070
Thank you...

1836
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:36,613
And this is Team B.

1837
02:29:38,282 --> 02:29:39,366
Okay, enough.

1838
02:29:39,449 --> 02:29:44,788
In this game, one team will tell one
or two players of the other team

1839
02:29:45,163 --> 02:29:47,791
the name of a film, silently.

1840
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,459
Then the player of that team

1841
02:29:49,668 --> 02:29:54,131
will have to describe
the name of the movie to his team

1842
02:29:54,214 --> 02:29:57,509
without talking and only by gestures.

1843
02:29:57,593 --> 02:29:59,761
Remember, you can't utter
a single word, okay?

1844
02:29:59,845 --> 02:30:02,264
Simple? Let's start with the team A.

1845
02:30:09,730 --> 02:30:12,065
-Come on.
-How would I enact it?

1846
02:30:16,445 --> 02:30:18,572
-Come on Miss Anjali.
-Okay... okay...

1847
02:30:20,198 --> 02:30:24,870
-Now, see, it's like, you know...
-You can't talk, it's cheating. Cheating.

1848
02:30:27,247 --> 02:30:29,708
This is cheating,
you're a cheater.

1849
02:30:29,791 --> 02:30:32,169
Okay, okay, okay...

1850
02:30:33,003 --> 02:30:35,881
Hey, come on, my friend.
Can't you even do this? Go on.

1851
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:39,885
Yeah, right.

1852
02:30:46,433 --> 02:30:49,269
Everybody, yeah. She's doing it.
It's working out.

1853
02:31:06,161 --> 02:31:07,287
Close your eyes.

1854
02:31:13,043 --> 02:31:14,503
Rangeela.

1855
02:31:14,878 --> 02:31:16,171
That's right.

1856
02:31:16,338 --> 02:31:19,883
-Rangeela! Yeah... Yeah... everybody.
-Yeah, that's good.

1857
02:31:21,843 --> 02:31:26,682
All right. It was very sexy.

1858
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,187
Thanks.

1859
02:31:34,272 --> 02:31:35,107
Welcome.

1860
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:38,860
No, no, no. I can't do it.
I can't do it.

1861
02:31:38,944 --> 02:31:41,321
Come on, Grandma.
Come on, Grandma.

1862
02:31:43,532 --> 02:31:45,325
No, children. No, no.

1863
02:31:46,702 --> 02:31:48,578
I don't watch Hindi movies, you know.

1864
02:31:48,662 --> 02:31:50,956
-I love Gone with the Wind.
-Keep quiet.

1865
02:31:51,623 --> 02:31:54,418
-Come on, Grandma.
-Come on, Mom.

1866
02:31:56,294 --> 02:31:57,504
Okay, son.

1867
02:31:59,673 --> 02:32:00,716
She agreed.

1868
02:32:00,799 --> 02:32:02,050
You go there, go there.

1869
02:32:02,134 --> 02:32:04,261
-Where? But why?
-There.

1870
02:32:04,344 --> 02:32:07,764
-Because I'm telling you. Go there.
-Grandma, has gone mad man.

1871
02:32:07,848 --> 02:32:10,267
-Yes, now bend.
-Bend?

1872
02:32:10,475 --> 02:32:11,601
-Like this?
-Yes.

1873
02:32:30,036 --> 02:32:32,289
Mummy, Madhuri...
Hum Aapke Hain Koun.

1874
02:32:36,168 --> 02:32:38,128
Okay, its my turn.

1875
02:32:42,883 --> 02:32:43,717
I love you.

1876
02:32:44,092 --> 02:32:46,136
-There's no such film like that.
-Yes, Papa, there is.

1877
02:32:46,219 --> 02:32:47,971
No, no. No such film is there.

1878
02:32:48,054 --> 02:32:50,265
-There is, Papa.
-I haven't seen such a film.

1879
02:32:50,348 --> 02:32:51,433
One minute.

1880
02:32:53,268 --> 02:32:56,271
There is. There is a film by that name.
I've seen it myself.

1881
02:32:56,354 --> 02:32:57,814
What's the name of the film?

1882
02:32:59,024 --> 02:33:00,192
All right, okay...

1883
02:33:09,367 --> 02:33:10,911
Yeah... Okay...

1884
02:33:10,994 --> 02:33:13,163
Three... Three words.

1885
02:33:20,212 --> 02:33:22,339
Yes, I know there are three words. Next?

1886
02:33:24,132 --> 02:33:25,258
I can't do it.

1887
02:33:25,884 --> 02:33:29,179
-Rahul, what are you doing?
-Your son has gone mad.

1888
02:33:32,808 --> 02:33:35,560
Rahul, I can't understand anything.
What are you doing?

1889
02:33:38,522 --> 02:33:41,024
Come on, Rahul,
now... No... Now.

1890
02:33:46,363 --> 02:33:49,282
Yeah, what is it? What?

1891
02:33:56,915 --> 02:34:00,043
I love you. How to act it out?

1892
02:34:06,424 --> 02:34:07,884
Do it again.

1893
02:34:11,888 --> 02:34:13,765
No... No... No... No...
He's doing it wrong.

1894
02:34:13,932 --> 02:34:14,975
I love you.

1895
02:34:20,772 --> 02:34:21,857
I love you.

1896
02:34:22,649 --> 02:34:23,984
You couldn't do that?

1897
02:34:25,110 --> 02:34:26,236
Couldn't...

1898
02:34:26,319 --> 02:34:28,405
If you did, we would have won.

1899
02:34:34,578 --> 02:34:37,414
Oh, God! Come on kids, to the barn.

1900
02:34:37,831 --> 02:34:42,586
Run, Nikhil. Come on.
Come on. Faster.

1901
02:34:48,133 --> 02:34:49,593
Come on, faster.

1902
02:34:56,224 --> 02:34:58,018
Give me that. Okay, thanks.

1903
02:35:06,192 --> 02:35:07,986
Have you gone crazy? Stupid.

1904
02:35:09,404 --> 02:35:10,864
-Anjali.
-Yes?

1905
02:35:11,656 --> 02:35:13,116
I'm feeling very cold.

1906
02:35:16,036 --> 02:35:18,038
Come with me,
I'll take you somewhere.

1907
02:35:18,121 --> 02:35:19,497
But...

1908
02:35:47,025 --> 02:35:48,109
No music.

1909
02:38:31,981 --> 02:38:35,401
I love you. I love you.

1910
02:38:35,485 --> 02:38:40,198
I love you so much. I really love you.

1911
02:38:40,698 --> 02:38:42,617
Hey, I love you, too.

1912
02:38:51,292 --> 02:38:53,920
Almeda, can't you plug
the leakage properly. Go.

1913
02:38:54,337 --> 02:38:57,507
-Anjali.
-Mom. Did Anjali come here?

1914
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:59,968
-She is sitting here.
-Not this one, the other one.

1915
02:39:00,051 --> 02:39:01,845
You help him up there.

1916
02:39:01,928 --> 02:39:03,179
-Rahul.
-Anjali...

1917
02:39:05,807 --> 02:39:06,850
Rahul, I...

1918
02:39:07,183 --> 02:39:10,770
Anjali, I wanted to talk to you.

1919
02:39:11,312 --> 02:39:14,274
Actually, I wanted to talk to you there,
but you suddenly...

1920
02:39:18,611 --> 02:39:20,238
This stable is your summer camp?

1921
02:39:22,615 --> 02:39:26,161
Hi, guys! Hey, I know you.

1922
02:39:26,953 --> 02:39:30,248
From where...
Yes, telephone man.

1923
02:39:30,957 --> 02:39:32,000
Yeah.

1924
02:39:32,625 --> 02:39:33,585
What's up, dude?

1925
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:35,920
But what are you doing in this stable?

1926
02:39:36,796 --> 02:39:40,592
Hey, is this your Anjali?

1927
02:39:46,973 --> 02:39:48,558
This is my Anjali.

1928
02:39:51,477 --> 02:39:54,272
And this is my Anjali.

1929
02:40:11,831 --> 02:40:14,292
Wow... Amazing man, too good.

1930
02:40:14,500 --> 02:40:16,461
Just like Michael Jordan!
My friend, you're too good.

1931
02:40:16,544 --> 02:40:18,129
I'm not that good.

1932
02:40:18,213 --> 02:40:20,131
-I've lost.
-Lost?

1933
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:22,425
I don't believe this, friend,
not possible.

1934
02:40:22,508 --> 02:40:23,801
Okay, tell me, who won?

1935
02:40:24,469 --> 02:40:27,180
-Anjali.
-Your Anjali?

1936
02:40:29,182 --> 02:40:32,560
-Your Anjali.
-My Anjali? In basketball?

1937
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:37,315
Tell me something.
You were with her in college, right?

1938
02:40:38,024 --> 02:40:41,152
How was she?
Who were her friends? I want to know...

1939
02:40:41,236 --> 02:40:45,156
She was the life and pride our college.
Everybody took their problems to her.

1940
02:40:46,032 --> 02:40:47,242
Nothing has changed.

1941
02:40:47,533 --> 02:40:50,245
Even I've come to her with my problem.

1942
02:40:51,871 --> 02:40:52,997
What is your problem?

1943
02:40:55,041 --> 02:40:59,003
My problem is that I love her
very much, you know?

1944
02:40:59,254 --> 02:41:01,881
-I know.
-You know...

1945
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:06,177
What kind of friend are you?

1946
02:41:06,761 --> 02:41:09,138
You didn't even come for our engagement.

1947
02:41:09,222 --> 02:41:10,556
You're engaged?

1948
02:41:12,934 --> 02:41:18,439
Yes, but with great difficulty.
The wedding is in December, I think.

1949
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:25,029
Hey! Tell your friend if she doesn't marry
me in December...

1950
02:41:25,363 --> 02:41:30,410
Then... I'll marry this basketball.

1951
02:41:30,493 --> 02:41:32,036
Marry the basketball?

1952
02:41:32,912 --> 02:41:34,914
-See you, dude.
-Okay, dude

1953
02:41:34,998 --> 02:41:36,541
-Basketball?
-Bye.

1954
02:41:48,428 --> 02:41:51,723
We live once, we die once,

1955
02:41:52,598 --> 02:41:56,394
we get married once, we also love...

1956
02:42:08,906 --> 02:42:09,741
Anjali.

1957
02:42:13,786 --> 02:42:15,580
Men are very weak...

1958
02:42:17,457 --> 02:42:18,750
They are very weak...

1959
02:42:20,793 --> 02:42:22,420
They make principles...

1960
02:42:23,463 --> 02:42:27,425
But they forget that no principle
can override the heart.

1961
02:42:29,135 --> 02:42:33,681
And we make these obstinate,
fragile men realize,

1962
02:42:34,807 --> 02:42:39,103
bonds of the heart are based
on feelings not principles.

1963
02:42:41,647 --> 02:42:43,858
But these bonds
are created by telling the

1964
02:42:43,941 --> 02:42:46,027
other person about one's inner feelings.

1965
02:42:50,823 --> 02:42:53,451
Tell him what you feel, Anjali.

1966
02:42:57,663 --> 02:43:01,709
Sometimes saying what one feels
can break one's heart.

1967
02:43:03,169 --> 02:43:06,172
But by not saying it you won't,
be happy.

1968
02:43:07,507 --> 02:43:08,925
You won't be happy.

1969
02:43:17,266 --> 02:43:20,770
Congratulations and celebrations

1970
02:43:20,853 --> 02:43:24,482
We wish Miss Anjali
A happy wedded life

1971
02:43:24,690 --> 02:43:28,820
Congratulations
Congratulations and celebrations

1972
02:43:31,197 --> 02:43:33,324
What is this, Anjali?
You didn't even tell me.

1973
02:43:33,533 --> 02:43:35,326
Aman told me that you're getting...

1974
02:43:35,868 --> 02:43:38,079
Hey, congratulations.

1975
02:43:39,205 --> 02:43:42,667
You're happy, aren't you?
You're happy, aren't you?

1976
02:43:43,876 --> 02:43:45,753
Having heard this, are you happy?

1977
02:43:46,629 --> 02:43:47,755
I'm very happy.

1978
02:43:49,215 --> 02:43:53,511
-Then how can I be happy?
-I don't understand.

1979
02:43:56,556 --> 02:44:00,518
Something happens, Rahul.
You won't understand.

1980
02:44:09,152 --> 02:44:13,531
Something happens, Anjali.
You won't understand.

1981
02:44:21,247 --> 02:44:22,707
-Uncle?
-Yes?

1982
02:44:22,790 --> 02:44:24,750
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

1983
02:44:25,084 --> 02:44:28,045
Why are you marrying Miss Anjali?

1984
02:44:28,379 --> 02:44:31,841
-What? Why? Anything wrong?
-Yes.

1985
02:44:32,049 --> 02:44:34,260
-See, it's very simple.
-Explain.

1986
02:44:34,844 --> 02:44:36,137
You're so handsome.

1987
02:44:37,930 --> 02:44:39,557
-What happened?
-So good-looking.

1988
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:41,601
Oh! Thank you so much.

1989
02:44:42,268 --> 02:44:45,229
But Miss Anjali doesn't look so good.
Very bad.

1990
02:44:46,439 --> 02:44:50,401
You know you're right.
She's dark, fat, short.

1991
02:44:51,652 --> 02:44:54,614
Yes. You can get any girl you want.

1992
02:44:54,947 --> 02:44:56,908
-I can get any girl I want?
-Yes.

1993
02:44:57,492 --> 02:45:01,287
-Will you marry me?
-Me? No, no, no.

1994
02:45:01,621 --> 02:45:02,830
Why? Am I that bad?

1995
02:45:05,082 --> 02:45:07,710
Then, you'll have to find
a nice girl for me.

1996
02:45:07,919 --> 02:45:09,712
-I've found someone.
-Who?

1997
02:45:09,795 --> 02:45:10,838
That one.

1998
02:45:16,427 --> 02:45:17,553
That MTV girl.

1999
02:45:17,762 --> 02:45:20,223
Hi, this is Neelam show, yo.

2000
02:45:21,724 --> 02:45:25,269
Then what will happen to this Anjali?
You'll have to find someone for her.

2001
02:45:25,353 --> 02:45:27,855
-I've found someone.
-Have you?

2002
02:45:27,939 --> 02:45:29,524
-Should I say who?
-No, no.

2003
02:45:29,607 --> 02:45:31,150
-I'm gonna tell you.
-No, no, no.

2004
02:45:31,234 --> 02:45:34,153
-No, no, I'm gonna tell you.
-No, no, no. Please, no...

2005
02:45:34,237 --> 02:45:37,406
Aman, I want to go back tonight.

2006
02:46:20,741 --> 02:46:22,118
Goodbye, Mr. Almeda.

2007
02:47:02,408 --> 02:47:03,409
You're leaving?

2008
02:47:08,247 --> 02:47:09,790
Please don't go.

2009
02:47:40,071 --> 02:47:40,905
Anjali...

2010
02:48:22,154 --> 02:48:27,118
You gave this to Tina,
when she was going to start a new life.

2011
02:48:30,996 --> 02:48:33,207
You are also starting a new life today.

2012
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,046
I know,

2013
02:48:41,298 --> 02:48:43,759
that you and Rahul
will be very happy together.

2014
02:48:46,512 --> 02:48:49,265
Aman, Aman.

2015
02:48:53,436 --> 02:48:54,270
Aman.

2016
02:48:58,357 --> 02:49:02,528
Oh, my love

2017
02:49:02,611 --> 02:49:07,616
Oh, my love

2018
02:49:07,825 --> 02:49:13,205
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

2019
02:49:14,165 --> 02:49:19,253
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

2020
02:49:20,254 --> 02:49:23,299
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

2021
02:49:23,382 --> 02:49:25,926
My heart cried
And my eyes filled with tears

2022
02:49:26,010 --> 02:49:29,346
There's nothing more left to say

2023
02:49:29,472 --> 02:49:35,227
You did not remember me
There's nothing more left to say

2024
02:49:37,813 --> 02:49:40,274
Please make arrangements
for the wedding.

2025
02:49:40,733 --> 02:49:42,443
I don't want to wait any longer.

2026
02:49:42,777 --> 02:49:46,822
But, Anjali, Guruji said that there's no
auspicious date before December.

2027
02:49:46,906 --> 02:49:48,199
Mom!

2028
02:49:49,116 --> 02:49:52,161
Mother, dates don't bring
happiness, destiny does...

2029
02:49:53,954 --> 02:49:55,915
...and no one can change that.

2030
02:51:15,494 --> 02:51:18,205
Look! Aman's here and
that too on a mule.

2031
02:51:24,086 --> 02:51:27,172
The priest has arrived,
someone, attend to him and...

2032
02:51:29,133 --> 02:51:30,217
Greetings.

2033
02:51:31,552 --> 02:51:33,012
You're Rahul, aren't you?

2034
02:51:33,804 --> 02:51:37,933
Yes. Anjali and I...

2035
02:51:39,059 --> 02:51:40,060
I know.

2036
02:51:40,227 --> 02:51:42,354
Anjali is getting married?

2037
02:51:44,106 --> 02:51:49,278
Yes. Anjali made such a hasty decision
to get married

2038
02:51:49,486 --> 02:51:52,364
that I didn't get time
to fully prepare for it.

2039
02:51:53,949 --> 02:51:58,329
I'm coming. Please sit down.

2040
02:51:59,121 --> 02:52:00,456
I'll join you soon.

2041
02:52:10,507 --> 02:52:11,800
They say,

2042
02:52:11,884 --> 02:52:14,678
if you make a wish
when you see a shooting star,

2043
02:52:14,762 --> 02:52:16,180
your wish will be fulfilled.

2044
02:52:47,294 --> 02:52:48,128
Anjali...

2045
02:54:30,981 --> 02:54:36,487
I had faith in you
But still I was restless

2046
02:54:40,783 --> 02:54:46,163
I had faith in you
But still I was restless

2047
02:54:47,539 --> 02:54:53,045
I waited for you for years

2048
02:54:54,338 --> 02:55:00,052
But still you never
Said anything then

2049
02:55:00,677 --> 02:55:03,764
What you said now

2050
02:55:04,306 --> 02:55:09,978
My heart in a helpless state
Cries quietly

2051
02:55:11,063 --> 02:55:13,315
What am I to do?

2052
02:55:14,191 --> 02:55:16,944
Something is happening

2053
02:55:17,694 --> 02:55:23,283
What am I to do?
Something is happening

2054
02:55:49,226 --> 02:55:52,187
The auspicious time is running
out, please call the bride.

2055
02:55:52,563 --> 02:55:53,397
Anjali.

2056
02:55:57,276 --> 02:56:00,612
The auspicious time is almost
over, please call the bride.

2057
02:56:03,031 --> 02:56:04,241
Anjali, let's go.

2058
02:56:55,083 --> 02:56:58,503
I'll drag you to the marriage
pandal, I told you, didn't I?

2059
02:57:55,394 --> 02:57:56,228
Aman...

2060
02:57:57,771 --> 02:57:58,981
You know,

2061
02:57:59,982 --> 02:58:02,734
I always wanted to see
that love in your eyes...

2062
02:58:03,652 --> 02:58:05,279
...that I have in mine.

2063
02:58:07,239 --> 02:58:08,991
I've seen that love today.

2064
02:58:11,743 --> 02:58:13,328
But it is not for me.

2065
02:58:15,289 --> 02:58:16,415
You're crazy, Anjali.

2066
02:58:18,625 --> 02:58:20,585
You've only loved him.

2067
02:58:22,713 --> 02:58:26,300
Ever since you've understood
and known what love is.

2068
02:58:27,592 --> 02:58:28,885
You've only loved him.

2069
02:58:30,512 --> 02:58:31,805
Rahul is your first love.

2070
02:58:35,642 --> 02:58:39,730
And no one understands first love
more than I do.

2071
02:58:44,443 --> 02:58:48,113
You were going to give this

2072
02:58:49,531 --> 02:58:50,741
Stupid!

2073
02:58:53,368 --> 02:58:55,370
How can l come between this love...

2074
02:58:58,540 --> 02:59:00,834
...that was never mine in the first place?

2075
02:59:05,714 --> 02:59:07,507
And anyway, someone told me that...

2076
02:59:08,508 --> 02:59:10,969
...I'm so handsome, I can get anyone.

2077
02:59:26,109 --> 02:59:27,861
-Aman...
-What are you saying?

2078
02:59:42,751 --> 02:59:43,794
Go.

2079
02:59:50,675 --> 02:59:51,885
Go.

2080
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:23,560
The Groom with a garland of flowers

2081
03:01:23,643 --> 03:01:28,106
The bride's hands are smeared with henna

2082
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:32,986
What is the vermillion saying...
Listen

2083
03:01:33,445 --> 03:01:37,908
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

2084
03:01:38,158 --> 03:01:42,746
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

2085
03:01:42,829 --> 03:01:46,750
The Bridegroom has come home
The Bridegroom has come home

2086
03:01:46,833 --> 03:01:52,506
Why's the bride shy?
The Bridegroom has come home

2087
03:02:45,475 --> 03:02:49,145
There is a strange girl

2088
03:02:49,229 --> 03:02:52,732
She is a dream
Is she for real or a story

2089
03:02:53,316 --> 03:02:56,820
Look at this mad one
She's not changed

2090
03:02:56,903 --> 03:03:00,156
She is still the same crazy one

2091
03:03:08,957 --> 03:03:12,711
There is a strange boy

2092
03:03:13,128 --> 03:03:16,590
He is a dream
Is he for real or a story

2093
03:03:16,965 --> 03:03:21,136
Look at this mad one
He's not changed

2094
03:03:21,219 --> 03:03:24,681
He is still the same crazy one

2095
03:03:32,606 --> 03:03:36,359
There is a strange girl

2096
03:03:36,443 --> 03:03:40,113
She is a dream
Is she for real or a story

2097
03:03:40,739 --> 03:03:44,200
Look at this mad one
He's not changed

2098
03:03:44,326 --> 03:03:47,871
He is still the same crazy one

2099
03:04:20,779 --> 03:04:26,743
You don't know how many dreams
You have inspired in me

2100
03:04:32,123 --> 03:04:35,543
Wakes up nor sleeps

2101
03:04:39,673 --> 03:04:43,426
Something is happening

2102
03:04:47,889 --> 03:04:51,017
Something is happening

2103
03:04:51,810 --> 03:04:55,146
Something is happening

2104
03:04:55,522 --> 03:04:59,234
Something is happening
