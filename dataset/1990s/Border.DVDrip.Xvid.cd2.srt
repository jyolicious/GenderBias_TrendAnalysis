1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,429
Why did you run for the mail?

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,739
Who's going to write to you anyway?

3
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:20,510
Didn't you say you have
no one in the world?

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,146
You're an idiot!
These guys are my family!

5
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,951
- You're right.
- We share the bonds of love.

6
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:30,379
That you certainly do.

7
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,955
When these guys receive
their letters...

8
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:37,251
...some of them have tears in
their eyes, and yet others laugh.

9
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,487
l laugh and cry with them, too.

10
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:50,864
This is funny! ''Everything
else is okay'', she says.

11
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,644
What are you laughing for? ls it
a letter from your wife?

12
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:56,703
Yes, it is.
Let me read it out to you.

13
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,810
lt doesn't have all
the details, does it?

14
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,745
Oh come on! Not with me
here on the borders!

15
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:05,181
She says our uncle in Karnal is
dead... but everything is okay.

16
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,953
The cow had a calf which died;
but everything else is okay.

17
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:14,454
lt's four days since Munni has
been running a fever.

18
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,030
My son has fallen and broken his arm;
but everything else is all right!

19
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,966
My son is now 4 years old.

20
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,272
D'you know what toy he
has asked me to fetch?

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,437
He has asked me to bring an
enemy-tank when l go home...

22
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,781
...so we can both play together.

23
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,850
What does your son write?
His handwriting seems to be good.

24
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:37,653
He writes good things, too.

25
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:42,653
He writes that the people across
the border are just like us.

26
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:47,056
They dress like us and speak
a language similar to ours.

27
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:52,100
lf all this is true, why then
do they fight with us, he asks?

28
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,598
Return home at the earliest,
when the war is over.

29
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,874
l miss you very much.

30
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:03,272
''There has been no letter from you
ever since you have left''

31
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:04,547
''Are you angry with me?''

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,850
''Don't ever be angry, even if
the world is against me''

33
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,816
''Or l'd have had
enough of my life''

34
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:13,286
''l had been to your house.
Your mother is fine''

35
00:02:14,392 --> 00:02:17,725
''She's lonely and keeps
waiting for you...''

36
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:20,163
''...making the wedding gear
for you all the time''

37
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:23,565
''l've told her that
her darling son...''

38
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,733
''...will come to my house,
when he wears the gear''

39
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,096
''Yours, Kamla''

40
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,538
''Dear son, the roof of
our house has been damaged''

41
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,576
''Every time we try to build it,
a storm knocks it off''

42
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:38,573
''lt's very difficult to
stay here when it snows''

43
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:42,509
''lf you could come at the earliest,
the house will have a new roof...''

44
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:44,014
''and we will have our son''

45
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:49,118
''Your mother wishes to see you
happily settled before she dies''

46
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:52,796
''You are undoubtedly doing your duty
in the service of the nation''

47
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,895
'' But you are also the only
support your parents have''

48
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,459
''Do write and tell us
when you're coming home''

49
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,574
What news, Bhairav Singh?

50
00:03:08,246 --> 00:03:10,771
What is this?
Tears in a lion's eyes!

51
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,883
They are tears of joy.

52
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,454
Really? What's the
good news? Tell me!

53
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,719
lt's a letter from my wife.

54
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,883
l'm going to be a father.

55
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,862
Congratulations!

56
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,731
We're going to lay out
a feast today!

57
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:35,502
- Don't forget the porridge!
- Everyone gets booze from me!

58
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,908
Wait and watch! You're going
to have a baby-son!

59
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,156
There's a message
from the Command, sir!

60
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:43,371
Friends! The enemy has
launched an attack!

61
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,609
Have the village vacated.
The enemy has begun the attack.

62
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:51,946
We can't handle the post
and the civilians together.

63
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,390
l entrust this task to you because
you speak their language.

64
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:57,921
Undoubtedly, sir.

65
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,532
Rush to the border pillar...

66
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:06,661
...and keep me informed on
the enemy's movements.

67
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:17,172
Have the soldiers on alert and
ready the post for a battle.

68
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:18,609
Don't you worry, sir!

69
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,169
Come on. Let's march
to the pillar.

70
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,673
Move! The Commander wants
to meet you folks!

71
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,178
What mistake have we made, sir?

72
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,280
They won't even let me
bring my camel back!

73
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,286
What is the matter, sir?
What are your orders?

74
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,620
- Are all the villagers here?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,918
You know you're staying on the border
and since war has broken out...

76
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,859
...the enemy can attack
at any time.

77
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:08,522
So quickly take your children and
things, and leave the village.

78
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,533
- l want the village vacated.
- lt's a fight between the armies.

79
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,131
Why will they target us?

80
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:20,069
The enemy's bombs will not heed names
and things when they explode here.

81
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:01,434
Look after yourself,
Mr. Bhagiram...

82
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:18,018
Have the village vacated!
Quick!

83
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:30,540
They've blown up the barracks!

84
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:37,878
But they couldn't touch
the Goddess's temple.

85
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:45,648
Just you wait and watch!
We're going to win this war, sir!

86
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,288
Because the Goddess protects us!

87
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,881
Get out of the village!
Go on!

88
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,419
We've been asking you to do it!

89
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,092
Move it! Quick!

90
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:32,226
Get out! Hurry up!

91
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,438
Come on... Hurry up!

92
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:52,252
Mother!

93
00:19:56,887 --> 00:20:00,516
They're not our tanks, sir! They're
coming from across the pillar!

94
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,208
A whole regiment of tanks from
Pakistan is headed for Longewala!

95
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:02,147
l see. Which is why they're
using artillery fire...

96
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,884
to drown the noise of the
advancing tanks.

97
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:16,657
Follow them like a shadow...

98
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:01,940
What treasure do you have in there
that you will risk your life?

99
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:03,711
- Go away...
- l can't go, sir!

100
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:06,777
My father gave me the Holy Quran
before he died, sir.

101
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:09,412
l've left it in there
by the oven, sir.

102
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,505
Here you are... now go away.

103
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:44,152
You went in there and
got the Quran for me, sir.

104
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:47,613
But you're a Hindu, aren't you?

105
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:51,459
Yes, l am.
Which itself explains my deed.

106
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:56,332
To render selfless service is what
Hinduism is all about.

107
00:22:57,267 --> 00:23:00,361
This what the true Hindu has
been doing down the ages.

108
00:23:00,804 --> 00:23:02,362
Go on now. Please!

109
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:06,199
Hurry up! Run away... Quick!

110
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:10,870
And there are people who
call the Hindus infidels!

111
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,508
Lay the anti-tank mines
all around!

112
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,751
Don't be scared, Gurmail!
Pick it up!

113
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:24,460
The anti-tank mine won't blow up
under a man's weight.

114
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,863
lt needs thousands of pounds to
explode, that the tanks have.

115
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:30,625
Now lay the mines! Quick!

116
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,739
There's an emergency call for you
from the Air Command.

117
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,476
They want you to call
back immediately.

118
00:24:09,439 --> 00:24:12,499
The Pakistani air-force has
attacked our airbases...

119
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:14,037
...we need to give them
a fitting reply.

120
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,108
Our Prime Minister is likely to
declare an emergency anytime now.

121
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:15,261
As you've heard just now,
the war has broken out.

122
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,103
The enemy has commenced
attacks on our airbases.

123
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:19,571
We've got to give them a reply.

124
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:22,608
At the break of dawn tomorrow,...

125
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,304
...we will storm the
Rahim Yahya airbase.

126
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:27,427
They're heading for an attack
on our post, sir!

127
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,847
There's someone coming
this way, sir!

128
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,746
You will always find the black
sheep returning to you, sir.

129
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:21,983
You're the prodigal son...
You must not even be blamed.

130
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,816
You don't seem to have to
reached your home either.

131
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:26,958
l've returned from half-way
through the journey, sir.

132
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:29,422
l can leave my wife in
any state and condition...

133
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,128
...but l cannot desert
my company and my country.

134
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:36,338
l will obviously get leave after
we have won the war, sir.

135
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:37,735
Certainly.

136
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,068
Put me through to the C.O.

137
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:15,401
This is the Station Commander.
Who's that?

138
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:20,141
What is it, Major?

139
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:25,711
The Pakistani's have surrounded my
post Longewala from all sides, sir.

140
00:29:26,122 --> 00:29:27,282
They can launch an
attack anytime now.

141
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:30,425
They have 40 tanks and
troops of a thousand men!

142
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,225
l have just 120 men...

143
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:40,535
...but unfortunately you cannot
get air support tonight!

144
00:29:41,371 --> 00:29:42,360
Why not?

145
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:45,604
We have only hunter aircraft's.
They can't be used in night-combat!

146
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,104
But l will be there at
the break of dawn.

147
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:53,313
How will we hold fort
till dawn tomorrow?!

148
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,167
lt's hours away to sunrise.

149
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:19,671
- What's wrong, sir?
- Nothing, Harnam Singh.

150
00:30:22,045 --> 00:30:23,273
The hour of our test has arrived!

151
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,303
Blow up every tank you see!

152
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,760
And let's pray for those brave 120
soldiers, who are confronting death!

153
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,991
Have the soldiers
fall in, Ratan Singh!

154
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,108
Tonight is the night when
we are being put to a test!

155
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,677
Because the air-force cannot arrive
to help us till dawn tomorrow.

156
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:44,643
And there's a lot of
time before daybreak.

157
00:32:47,457 --> 00:32:50,585
Soldiers! There is the enemy!

158
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:56,121
We're just 120 men... and
they're a whole tank regiment!

159
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:01,396
We have been asked by the Command
to withdraw from our post.

160
00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:06,140
But they have left the
final decision to me.

161
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,112
And l have decided that,
l, Major Kuldip Singh...

162
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,849
...will not desert my post!

163
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:18,144
l now leave your decision to you!

164
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:24,320
Anyone wishing to leave the post,
is free to do so!

165
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:28,628
Sir! You must listen to my decision
before anyone else's, sir!

166
00:33:29,032 --> 00:33:30,260
Whether someone
stays here or not...

167
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,667
...l will not run away,
leaving my land to the enemy!

168
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:37,935
l'd rather die!
But l will not retrace my steps!

169
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:42,939
Bhairav Singh! Don't you ever
talk of dying again!

170
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:47,478
No dead man has ever
won a battle!

171
00:33:48,952 --> 00:33:51,819
You win a war only by
finishing the enemy!

172
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,187
l didn't reach my house, although
l was given leave, sir.

173
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:58,918
l returned, only to be with my
company in its battle with the enemy.

174
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:04,690
Was it to be told that the Command
has asked me to withdraw?!

175
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:09,369
You might as well shoot me, sir!
But l will not obey this order!

176
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:12,633
l understand how you feel
at heart, Mathura Das!

177
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,305
But the Command must've thought of
something while issuing the order.

178
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:20,545
We're just a hundred and twenty;
and the enemy's troops number 2000!

179
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:22,112
So what's new, sir?

180
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:26,150
The Revered Tenth Guru
of Sikhism,...

181
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,719
...Sri Guru Gobind Singh
has proclaimed...

182
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:32,257
...l will set birds
against even the hawks!

183
00:34:32,595 --> 00:34:34,256
Such will be the glory of Sikhs
in a victory of this kind!

184
00:34:35,932 --> 00:34:38,730
When even birds can
take on hawks, sir...

185
00:34:39,502 --> 00:34:41,436
...we're after all human!

186
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,973
We are not scared!

187
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:46,575
No one will leave!

188
00:34:47,176 --> 00:34:50,771
Do l take it then that all of you
will face the enemy with me?

189
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:52,312
lndeed, sir!

190
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,579
Should anyone of you try to run away
after taking this decision...

191
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,479
...l will personally kill him!

192
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:05,091
God forbid, but if l happen
to waver in my step...

193
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:10,557
...and try to run away, you must
get together and gun me down!

194
00:35:12,535 --> 00:35:14,628
That's an order from your
Commanding Officer!

195
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,831
Blessed is the one
who proclaims...

196
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,641
...in God lies true glory!

197
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:25,907
Victory to the path of righteousness
paved by the Gurus!

198
00:35:28,217 --> 00:35:29,980
Soldiers! Back to your positions!

199
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:54,510
Listen carefully to what
l have to say.

200
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:57,002
The Command is not ignorant
of our weak position.

201
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,515
They want me to decide if we
are to fight or to withdraw.

202
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,085
You're forgetting, sir! l am
Major Vir Bhan's son!

203
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,088
l can't even think of retracting!

204
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,291
That's exactly what
l expected from you!

205
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,080
Come on, you swines!

206
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,633
No one will open fire
till l order it!

207
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:29,462
Let the creeps get a bit closer!

208
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,637
Or whom have we laid
the landmines for?

209
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:48,220
Victory to Mother lndia!

210
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,692
Hold it, soldier! Stay back!

211
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:04,973
The lndians seem to have
laid anti-tank mines for us.

212
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,640
No one will advance any further!

213
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:14,080
'' Blessed is the one who proclaims...
in the Lord's name is glory''

214
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:18,348
''Victory to the path of righteousness
paved by our Gurus!''

215
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,556
We seemed to have got
wrong information.

216
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:27,322
They have a battalion of 600 men.
Not a company of 120 soldiers!

217
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,695
The angels of your death
await you!

218
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:42,205
Either send your guys out...

219
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:45,105
...and surrender with your
hands on your head...

220
00:38:45,815 --> 00:38:48,477
...or say your last prayer!

221
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:55,924
Save your measly band!
You can't escape!

222
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:01,594
You're Ghulam Dastagir, aren't you?
The infamous thug of Lahore?

223
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:06,031
Scum from the rotten gutters
of your city?!

224
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:13,475
Only time will tell if l say
my last prayers or you!

225
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:23,545
Should you set another foot forward
on your silly assignment...

226
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:27,287
...l will send you back to the
gutters you have come from!

227
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:34,658
What makes you shut up?

228
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:48,201
Give him a reply.

229
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:14,911
Mathura Das!
What the hell is wrong?

230
00:43:53,489 --> 00:44:01,589
Come on! Steady...

231
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,793
- Bhagiram! lt's you!
- You're surprised, eh?!

232
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,328
You're handling a gun!

233
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:10,327
What will a soldier handle,
if not a gun?

234
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,825
But l've always seen a
ladle in your hands!

235
00:45:14,803 --> 00:45:17,738
lt's thanks to the ladle that
you're such a strong man!

236
00:45:18,641 --> 00:45:21,235
Now watch me work magic
with these guns!

237
00:45:21,644 --> 00:45:24,374
l will bump off no less than a
couple of the enemy's soldiers!

238
00:45:24,713 --> 00:45:25,907
Damn you...!

239
00:45:26,248 --> 00:45:28,842
Now, buddy... who's going to
feed me if you kick the bucket?

240
00:45:32,588 --> 00:45:36,490
Listen, buddy... l hope you remember
the inn we start after retirement?

241
00:45:37,226 --> 00:45:38,352
We're going to be
equal partners.

242
00:45:39,228 --> 00:45:40,855
- l have a condition.
- What is that?

243
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:45,798
- You will not eat at the inn.
- How can that be?

244
00:45:46,635 --> 00:45:49,103
Then we can't have
an equal partnership.

245
00:45:50,306 --> 00:45:52,706
l will have 90% of the holdings;
you will get just 10%

246
00:45:53,142 --> 00:45:53,767
What for?

247
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:57,178
You're going to eat stuff
worth that much of money!

248
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:31,273
Damn it! The spring is broken!

249
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:53,754
You wanted a spring, Bhairav Singh.
Here it is.

250
00:47:55,097 --> 00:47:57,691
Open fire! Go on!

251
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:06,739
This land is as much my mother
as it is yours, Bhairav Singh!

252
00:48:09,745 --> 00:48:13,408
lf possible, please carry
a message to my wife.

253
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:20,252
Tell her that l am indeed guilty
and answerable to her.

254
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:24,183
l am repaying a debt to my motherland
in this birth of mine...

255
00:48:24,827 --> 00:48:26,624
...l will repay her debt
when l am born again!

256
00:48:27,663 --> 00:48:30,996
l will repay her debt
in my next birth!

257
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:35,398
Das! No...!

258
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,759
Bhairav Singh!
Go and take over the MMG's!

259
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,061
Take charge of the MMG's,
Bhairav Singh!

260
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,561
Take charge of the MMG's, l say!

261
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:15,204
Go and take charge of the MMG's!

262
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:45,269
l'll fix these guys now...!

263
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:14,093
We're returning to
the post, Gurnam!

264
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,569
l need covering fire!

265
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,708
Not one of them must escape!

266
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,048
Dharmveer is returning, sir.
He has asked for covering fire.

267
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:49,527
Officer Dharmveer is returning!
Give him some covering fire!

268
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:33,277
Blow them up!

269
00:52:57,933 --> 00:52:59,161
Go and take charge of the
LMG in the next column!

270
00:53:03,572 --> 00:53:07,531
Remember the great man, Dharmveer!

271
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:10,536
Remember the great
Major Vir Bhan!

272
00:53:12,381 --> 00:53:18,251
lnvoke your father, my dear soldier!

273
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:00,460
''One Sikh shall take on a hundred
and twenty five thousand...''

274
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,830
''...and bring glory
to my revered Guru!''

275
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:17,106
Duck, soldiers!

276
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:36,121
Ratan Singh!
What the hell are you doing?

277
00:54:59,221 --> 00:54:59,880
Bhagiram!

278
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:06,285
You won't have to cook for
10 extra guys anymore!

279
00:55:06,728 --> 00:55:08,696
- Don't say that...
- You remember, don't you?

280
00:55:10,499 --> 00:55:18,133
Ratan Singh... get up!
Don't leave me, my friend!

281
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:20,638
You're my partner!

282
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:24,308
You must start that inn, Bhagiram!

283
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:29,479
l'm game for the 10% share
in the profits!

284
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:35,219
But see that you pay the
profits to my parents.

285
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:39,950
They have no other support...

286
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:41,822
Ratan Singh!

287
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:54,404
They who can set birds
against the hawks, sir...

288
00:55:55,477 --> 00:56:00,141
...will bring glory to
Guru Gobind Singh's name!

289
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,187
How could you do this?
You've left a friend?!

290
00:56:15,564 --> 00:56:17,088
Why doesn't this
bloody night end?!

291
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,917
That MMG gun has
bothered us no end.

292
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:15,648
Blow it up with the tank.

293
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,021
Bhairav Singh!
Are you all right?

294
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:52,516
Watch out!

295
00:58:53,922 --> 00:58:54,854
Beware!

296
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:58,284
Do not let them set foot
on my motherland!

297
00:58:58,593 --> 00:59:02,620
Mother... here l come!

298
00:59:02,964 --> 00:59:04,659
l'm coming!

299
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,458
Bhairav Singh! Come back here!

300
00:59:56,785 --> 00:59:57,843
Mow him down!

301
01:00:00,755 --> 01:00:01,744
Kill the swine!

302
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:29,979
Oh Mother... Goddess Shakti!

303
01:00:30,385 --> 01:00:36,085
Goddess Mother...!

304
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:44,093
Goddess Shakti!

305
01:00:44,399 --> 01:00:46,424
The infidel has an anti-tank mine
in his hands!

306
01:00:48,403 --> 01:00:49,870
Drive the tank backwards!

307
01:00:51,306 --> 01:00:52,898
Backwards, l say!

308
01:00:54,142 --> 01:00:56,804
Drive it back... Quick!

309
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,341
Hurry up! Drive it back...

310
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,607
Assemble here, soldiers!

311
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:16,916
There is the enemy!
We must defeat them!

312
01:02:18,826 --> 01:02:20,316
Go for them in full force!

313
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:26,790
Go for them in your senses!
Charge!

314
01:06:08,489 --> 01:06:12,721
Hold your fire till
our soldiers return!

315
01:06:26,507 --> 01:06:29,670
There's still life in Dharmveer!
Give him covering fire!

316
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:50,558
You asked me to invoke memories
of my father, sir!

317
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:52,655
To invoke memories of the
great Major Vir Bhan!

318
01:07:53,394 --> 01:07:57,524
My father is here, sir...
to take me away.

319
01:08:00,334 --> 01:08:01,494
lt'll soon be dawn!

320
01:08:03,938 --> 01:08:05,803
You must live, Dharmveer!

321
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:36,299
Don't stop me, mother...
Please let me go!

322
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,965
Father is calling me over!

323
01:08:47,114 --> 01:08:47,910
Let me go...

324
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:47,703
He's still alive, sir.

325
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:53,305
Please don't kill me, sir!
For God's sake!

326
01:09:55,249 --> 01:09:58,878
For the sake of the God
you pray to!

327
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,651
ln the name of the Bhagwan
you worship!

328
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,547
Please don't kill me!

329
01:10:04,225 --> 01:10:06,216
l have little kids back home!

330
01:10:08,963 --> 01:10:10,828
What are your children's names?

331
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,962
Khalid... and Asma.

332
01:10:15,536 --> 01:10:19,233
Nice names. Now tell me
the plans of your forces.

333
01:10:20,374 --> 01:10:22,069
l'm an ordinary soldier, sir.

334
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:26,472
lt's the higher-ups
who plan strategy.

335
01:10:27,615 --> 01:10:35,715
All they said was that we'd have
breakfast at Jaisalmer in lndia.

336
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:40,049
That we'd have lunch

337
01:10:41,328 --> 01:10:43,489
And that we'd have
dinner in Delhi.

338

You are a soldier of your nation,

There's still an hour

346
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:48,419
Listen, brave soldiers of Pakistan!

347

You will be conquerors
if you taste victory!

348
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:54,626
And you will be martyrs
should you die!

349
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,034
Do not bother about the
anti-tank mines!

350
01:11:58,606 --> 01:11:59,937
Drive your tanks into their post!

But we're going to
feast on them today!

354
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:34,241
One Sikh is equal to a hundred and
twenty five thousand, said our Guru!

355
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:37,143
lt's time now to prove
His proclamation true!

356
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,050
'' Blessed is the one who
acknowledges the proclamation...''

01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,154
''Glory be to the Lord's
path of righteousness!''

358
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,585
''We tread the path
shown by the Lord...''

359
01:12:55,229 --> 01:12:56,856
''Victory to the Lord''

360
01:15:11,865 --> 01:15:17,064
''What's the fun in being alone?
Be it you or me?''

361
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:38,848
Escape! The lndian aircraft's
have arrived!

362
01:16:05,652 --> 01:16:08,348

They're hovering around us
like flies!

Most of our tanks have
already been destroyed!

366
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:55,659
Sir! We have won the battle!

Sir...?!
