00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,200
You've come after 2 years
You must hear the latest gossip

00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,600
Please spare me

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,080

- What a swinger he used to me
- Enough

6
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Muthiah's wife ran away with
Bahadur's son

7
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,360
They met at the Cinema house

8
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,560
Keep quiet

9
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,280
Sethu had a baby girl, Sixth one

10
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,800
But the speed is not lesser till now

11
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,520
The last monsoon was heavy,
but no great harvest

12
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,680
- In that rain..
- Get lost

13
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,360
You walked out of this house

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,360
Inherited from you

18
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,240
I said I inherited that from you

19
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,880

Who will pay that?
Money doesn't grow on trees?

29
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,080
I've got a job as proof reader
with a Newspaper

30
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,680
That will see me through

31
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,200
So! You don't need your
father's help, right?

32
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
You'll do what you like, but you
won't return to the village, right?

33
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,840
You haven't fallen for a
North India have you?

34
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Nothing like that

35
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,640
We're a respected Pillai family
in this village

36
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't bring home some Gujarati
or Punjab girl

37
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,480
That would be terrible Eat now

38
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
Did I come from Bombay only
to escort you around?

39
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,600
You don't lose anything by doing
that, do you?

120
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,040
What's your name?

121
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Why did you close the door?

I am sure my dad will not sign
in this progress report

128
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,160
There is a chance
I'll discontinue my studies

129
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
I will not come to school tomorrow

130
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Let's exchange bags, quick

131
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,160
What for?

Don't question

133
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,320
What is the need for us
to exchange our bags?

134
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
Who is it?

135
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,160

I don't know how to say it
but I'll tell you anyway

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,080
Don't cry! Why're you crying?

142
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,680
I haven't said anything yet

143
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,360
I saw the red bag and mistook you
for someone else

144
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,960
Come inside

145
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,400

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,920
Don't forget to bring it to
class tomorrow

149
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
They will chop off your hand, Shekhar

150
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,680
Let them I've 2 hands, Isn't it?

151
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,200
Why the hell are you playing with fire?
I'll fix you a better bride

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,200
- Is that Zeenat?
- Who else?

157
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,720
Taking her own sweet time
walk carefully, dear

158
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,040
Zeenat will be engaged soon
No wonder she seems so happy

159
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,960
Careful, or the boat will capsize

160
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
Don't be silly

161
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,760
Is Zeenat so inferior to you?

162
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,640
You said you wouldn't come today

163
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,600
Did you get the signature?

164
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,400
Where's your bag?
How can you forget your bag?

165
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,200
What's the matter?
Screaming like a woman in labor

166
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,120
What happened?
Zeenat, hold her hand

167
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,360
No

168
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,080
Hold her hand tight or
she may fall overboard

169
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
No need

170
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll forsake everything for you
will you come with me?

171
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,520
I Love you all my life

172
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,160
I'll wait for you at the fort tomorrow
Come there, if you love me

173
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,800
Here is kerosene, grandpa

174
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Why're you so late?

175
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,440
The ration shop was crowded

176
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,760
Serve father coffee

177
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,800
- Find some other to send to stores
- Then you find some other house to eat

178
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,720
Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn are...

179
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,360
It seems a deadly wind blowing

180
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,520
It's going to rain

181
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,480
Banu, pour rice into the bowl
Go and keep safe dried savories

182
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,840
Sister Banu, Zeenu was looking for you

183
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:23,640
"Dearest one, come
become one with me"

184
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:32,880
"My beloved, make me
one with you"

185
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:42,120
"Memories, become a part of me"

186
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:51,240
"Oh fair Moon, become
one with the sky"

187
00:21:52,440 --> 00:22:00,440
"If there is love, let it bloom
before my eyes"

188
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:09,720
"If fate intervenes, make me
one with the dust"

189
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:18,960
"Dearest one, come
become one with me"

190
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:28,120
"Memories, become a part of me"

191
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:05,480
"There's life in my body as I
await the breath of my life"

192
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,720
"If my little flower doesn't come I'll
turn to ashes on this mountain side"

193
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,560
"I don't care if I lose my life"

194
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,440
"That's not the reason for this song"

195
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,840
"To have a bright future with you"

196
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,760
"That's what I long"

197
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,400
"Is it the beginning or the end?"

198
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,200
"I've left it in your hands"

199
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:51,080
"Dearest one, today I've become
one with you"

200
00:23:52,280 --> 00:24:00,280
"I've overstepped my limits for
the love of you"

201
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:09,400
"Memories, you've become
a part of me"

202
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:18,720
"Dreams, you've become a part
of my reality"

203
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:27,840
"If there is love, let it bloom
before my eyes"

204
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:37,120
"If fate intervenes, make me
one with the dust"

205
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:46,280
"Dearest one, today I've become
one with you"

206
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:55,520
"Memories, you've become
a part of me"

207
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,800
"Just one look I lost myself"

208
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,680
"How could I stay away from you?"

209
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,880
"When one eye lights up with love"

210
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,000
"Won't the other one will
brighten up too?"

211
00:25:52,040 --> 00:26:00,040
"Like a river flows through the rocks
I came to see my beloved's face"

212
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,400
"Like the gently wafting breeze"

213
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,480
"I came to hear my beloved's voice"

214
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:18,520
"Even my tears taste sweet today"

215
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:27,640
"Dearest one, come
become one with me"

216
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:36,920
"My beloved, make me
one with you"

217
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,080
"Memories, become a part of me"

218
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:55,320
"Oh fair Moon, become
one with the sky"

219
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:04,560
"Like rain come and touch the soil
I've come and mingle with you"

220
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:13,720
"As the consent of my mind willingly
I've come and reached your boundary"

221
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:23,040
"Dearest one, today I've become
one with you"

222
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:32,120
"Memories, I've become
a part in your life"

223
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm Shekhar, Narayan Pillai's
younger son

224
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,280
I know, Sit down

225
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,480
- Serve him some tea
- No thank you

226
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,360
It's Okay. You're our guest.

227
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,800
I work for a newspaper in Bombay
I'm studying Journalism too

228
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,960
I don't know anything about
these things, I'm a Village man

229
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,560
I wish to marry your daughter
Shaila Banu

230
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,240
Get out, How dare you abuse
my hospitality, you dog

231
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,320
I've just finished my prayers
or I'd have killed you

232
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,800
Did you hear? He wants consent
to marry our daughter

233
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,560
Not consent, We wanted to
inform our elders

234
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,920
Get out..Shaila go in

235
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Banu, stay here

236
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
If this Basheer Ahmed gets mad
he will kill you right here

237
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
What audacity to..

238
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,080
Who are you? who are we?
Our blood will never mix

239
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,000
Give me your hand

240
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
Our blood will mix

241
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,520
- Where's he?
- He's inside

242
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,640
What's this?
How did it happen?

243
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,600
It's nothing

244
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,920
Did you tell him about the proposal
for his marriage?

245
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,240
Madhampatti Sivarama's daughter

246
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,640
Why Isn't he answering?

247
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,080
Tell him I'm not interested

248
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,280
How long will he exist on
dry rotis in Bombay?

249
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,240
The girl is nice, from a respectable
family, She will graduate soon

250
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,600
- Ask him to go see the girl
- No

251
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,000
- Why?
- I know when whom to marry

252
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,680
What's all this about?

253
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,680
I've already chosen a girl

254
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,160
Is it so?

255
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,960
Is she from Bombay? Have you now?
Where's she from? Is she a North Indian?

256
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,200
That's why I told you not to send him
to Bombay, you didn't listen

257
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
She's not from Bombay
She lives here

258
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,160
Who's she?

259
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,680
- Who's she? 
- If I tell you you will yell at me!

260
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Tell me, who it is

261
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,120
Basheer Ahmed's daughter

262
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,120
Is he the one who
manufactures bricks?

263
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,200
Convince him

264
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Where's my Elder Son?
Come, let's go

265
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Go and call for Basheer

266
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,360
Tell him Narayana Pillai
wants to meet him

267
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,200
If your daughter comes near my son
there will be a murder here

268
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm poor, but I've my pride

269
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,400
If anything goes amiss, the 2 families
will be wiped out

270
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,776
Are you trying to lure an educated boy
from a well-to-do family?

271
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,200
Who wants money? We've dignity
that's enough for us

272
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,616
- You're calling us shameless, then?
- That's not for me to say

273
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,040
You can't control your daughter
You're a fine one to talk

274
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,680
Why should your boys go after our
girls like dogs in heat?

275
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,520
Who's a dog?

276
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,240
Be grateful, I spared your son
when he came here

277
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,920
- Let's see, who kills whom
- Give me the sickle

278
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,520
Stop it! If you continue to fight
it will go to the village council

279
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,400
Then both the families
will be driven out

280
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,000
- Let's see how it happens
- Say the word I'll finish them

281
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,800
Lay a finger at your own peril

282
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,680
Shut up, you insignificant creep

283
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,760
Stop it Stop it I say

284
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,920
Stop this, we're the parents of the
boy and girl

285
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,160
And you people talk of killing
What's this nonsense?

286
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,720
So, all of you, You too

287
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,160
This is not good, I warn you

288
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,720
Satisfied?

289
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,160
You've disgraced me
Are you satisfied now?

290
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,200
- Nothing bad has happened, father
- Could things get any worse?

291
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,120
Has a day gone by when I haven't
visited the temple?

292
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,800
I've been the temple trustee
for the past 20 years

293
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,080
No decisions are taken without
my consent

294
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm held in such high esteem

295
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,160
During festivals, deity is brought to
our house 1st before Public procession

296
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
How's that possible now?

297
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,960
My son's chasing a Muslim girl her
father's after our blood

298
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,320
What's on earth's happening?

299
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,720
Enough of this nonsense in
the name of education

300
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,480
Shaila Banu's a nice girl, dad she
studies in my school

301
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Shut up

302
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,880
If your brother marries a Muslim girl
who will marry you?

303
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,480
Find her a Muslim boy, then..

304
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,360
I would slap the daylights
out of you

305
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,720
You're not a child anymore

306
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,840
But you're impertinent
Because of your education

307
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,640
So, what if I marry a Muslim girl?
Are Muslims enemies?

308
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,120
Marry her and be happy
But after I'm dead gone

309
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,880
I can't wait for you to die

310
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,920
What did you say?

311
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,440
What on earth is he saying?

312
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,800
Listen, you're very dear to me

313
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,400
If you love me, listen to me

314
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,400
If you love the Muslim girl
more go away

315
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,280
Leave forget all about us

316
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,400
Why do you talk like that?
Beg for your father's forgiveness

317
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,960
Dad, I'm going to Bombay.
I won't return

318
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:18,520
"If there is love, let it bloom
before my eyes"

319
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,800
"If fate intervenes, make me
one with the dust"

320
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:37,000
"Dearest one, come
become one with me"

321
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:46,240
"Memories, become a part of me"

322
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,120
How are you grandma?

323
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,680
- Where's Banu?
- Over there, why?

324
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:32,920
"There's life in my body as I
await the breath of my life"

325
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:42,160
"If my little flower doesn't come I'll
turn to ashes on this mountain side"

326
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,080
"I don't care if I lose my life"

327
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,040
"That's not the reason for this song"

328
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,200
"To have a bright future with you"

329
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,440
"That's what I long"

330
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,840
"Is it the beginning or the end?"

331
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,320
"I've left it in your hands"

332
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,560
Banu! Where's she?

333
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,400
Is your mother telling the truth?
Tell me

334
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,880
Is he writing to you from Bombay?
Answer me

335
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,680
You've disgraced me

336
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,280
I will kill you for this

337
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,200
Couldn't any of you women
bring her up properly?

338
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,760
Stop crying

339
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,880
You were born after my
first visit to Mecca

340
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,880
For whom am I
struggling like this?

341
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,720
For you, And you've disgraced me

342
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,360
Promise me that this won't
happen again

343
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,320
You will be married in 10 days
To a boy of my choice

344
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,840
Shall we get married?

345
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,200
- What?
- Aren't you scared?

346
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,800
I'm terribly scared
but I won't cry

347
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,120
Are you sure I don't cry?

348
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,480
Shall I take off my hand?

349
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,840
- Sit down
- Are you Shekhar?

350
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,040
- Yes, I'm Shekhar Narayan
- Your certificate, please

351
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,160
I registered a month back,
Our names have been on the notice board since then.

352
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,480
- That means..Oh shoot
- Do you have a witness

353
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,080
- Over there
- Who're they?

354
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,200
Those 3 are my friends
They're my colleagues too

355
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,680
- Are you from Madras?
- No, I've never seen Madras

356
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,320
We're from Mangudi,
South of Madurai

357
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,840
Do you know Madurai?
Heard of Tamil Sangam?

358
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,720
We both are from the same place

359
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,960
He's been here for the past few years
I came only this morning

360
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,960
- You're next
- Thank you

361
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,840
- Did I say anything wrong?
- No

362
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,360
- Why did you also stop me then?
- Only if you stop soon, he'll go

363
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,880
Only if he goes will we
get married soon

364
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,880
And I can kiss you

365
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,160
- What's your name?
- Shekhar

366
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,560
- Your father's name?
- Narayan Pillai

367
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,720
- Your name?
- Tell him

368
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,960
What's this?
You've betrayed me

369
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,120
Good gracious!
Did you marry her?

370
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,640
What could I do, grandma?
Her dad brandished a sickle and..

371
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,056
Threatened to cut me up if I didn't
marry her, So I married her

372
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,760
- Don't trust him
- I did, look at my plight

373
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:22,160
I've waited all these years
for him as a young girl

374
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,520
Don't let him escape
Hold on to him

375
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,320
This is my wife
We got married today

376
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,960
You didn't tell us
What's your name?

377
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,080
Sounds like a Muslim name

378
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,800
- Yes, I'm a Muslim
- Are you already married?

379
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,400
- Please keep quiet
- Why should I?

380
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,280
We do worship daily
How can we allow her?

381
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,440
I told you, Let me find out

382
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,680
Please ignore her

383
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,920
Some guests have come
Kids will stay with you

384
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,160
I'll manage

385
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
Please go inside

386
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,160
- What's the matter?
- They've got guests from Sholapur

387
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,760
So the kids will stay with us
for a couple of days

388
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Is that all?

389
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,400
What a wonderful first night

390
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,480
Not just tonight. It'll be so
for a few more nights

391
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,680
- What?
- Shut up go to sleep

392
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,080
- Shekhar, you look odd
- Your eyes are red

393
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,720
- What happened? Are you unwell?
- What's up? You seem tired

394
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,240
Sleepless night?

395
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,000
This is not the time to joke
get going

396
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:26,840
Your eyes are red
Why're you so tired?

397
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,600
Spent a sleepless night?

398
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Mother, you daughter got married..without
fanfare, Without her Mom Dad

399
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,360
Please forgive me

400
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,680
Please break the news
to father gently

401
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,280
However angry he may be, I'm
still his daughter

402
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,200
No one can change that
I'm very happy here, mother

403
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,560
What?

404
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,680
You said you've to attend classes
after work, that you'll be late

405
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,120
I can't even embrace my newly
wedded wife, How...

406
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,760
How can I attend class or study?

407
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,760
Just do what you've been doing
all these years

408
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:40,040
- I wasn't married all these years
- So?

409
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,080
I'm scared, Somebody may see us

410
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,160
So what? After all, we're
husband and wife

411
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,880
Confine that to our room

412
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,520
It's hardly ours now

413
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,520
- Then be patient
- How's that possible?

414
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,840
We've been married 36 hours,
10,000 more couples would've been married after us.

415
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,760
By now, the others...

416
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,360
For you

417
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,560
Mother, forgive me

418
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,520
Your letter

419
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,280
Letter's from home

420
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,560
It's from my father

421
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,400
- Aren't you going to read it?
- It can wait

422
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,440
I can't stand the suspense

423
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,600
If I read it, we'll only fight

424
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
No, we won't

425
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,520
He has sent money

426
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,920
He must've cooled down

427
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,640
I've washed my hands off
my 2nd son

428
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,200
But your mother can't get over it

429
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,720
Your brother took her to the doctor
she has high blood pressure

430
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,920
I don't need to say who's the
cause for this

431
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,440
What kind of a girl.

432
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
Read on

433
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,040
What kind of a girl will
elope with a man?

434
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,600
She is as shameless..
As her parents

435
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,760
My parents are not such
indecent people

436
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,160
That's why I said
I wouldn't read it

437
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,560
Let anyone comment about me
but not about my family

438
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,840
Do we pass nasty comments
about your family?

439
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,240
I didn't write it..He did

440
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,280
Read on

441
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,000
I know she's nice girl
But I never thought you

442
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,680
Don't tell lies..Read
What he's written

443
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,600
I'll send back his money

444
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,920
I know why you got married
in haste

445
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,640
I'm sending Rs.1000
Take her to a good hospital

446
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,400
Get rid of it send her back
to her parents

447
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:24,400
Tell her I'm sorry

448
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:35,520
Tell him it's Okay

449
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,400
- Should I change my religion?
- What?

450
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,200
Should I change my religion?

451
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,000
Should I change my religion?

452
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:01,560
Tell him there's no need

453
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,760
Tell her I love her

454
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:14,600
He says he loves you

455
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,960
You promised to marry me and
ditched me

456
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,920
I didn't, I'll definitely marry
you in my next birth

457
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,600
- What about me?
- You too

458
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,920
- Poor girls
- Are you just teasing or...?

459
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,640
- He says he loves you
- Shut up, fatso

460
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,720
I think our landlady likes us
That's why, she has packed off her guests

461
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,840
What're you waiting out here for?
Go in

462
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,320
"On that shore of Arabian Sea
I saw a beauty""

463
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,880
"I saw that maiden breeze.."

464
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,480
"Disrobing herself!"

465
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,640
"A Lotus of the Mosque"

466
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,040
"I saw your feet.."

467
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,760
"Slowly as your silk half saree
slipped down.."

468
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,040
"I saw rest of it!"

469
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,120
"When the tip of your saree hit me..."

470
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,160
"Oh! What an happiness!"

471
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,880
"When the tender fingers
touched the heart.."

472
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,920
"Oh! What a pleasant feeling!"

473
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,760
"Mind is overcoming with ecstasy
as blood curdles.."

474
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,160
"Are kisses 100's of varieties?"

475
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,240
"When disrobed, will shy, modesty,
ignorance vanish?"

476
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,000
"On that shore of Arabian Sea
I saw a beauty"

477
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,480
"I saw that maiden breeze.."

478
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,320
"Disrobing herself!"

479
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,000
"A Lotus of the Mosque"

480
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,400
"I saw your feet.."

481
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,360
"Slowly as your silk half saree
slipped down.."

482
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,800
"I saw rest of it!"

483
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,400
"After teaching and giving..."

484
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,720
"There're still a few kisses left.."

485
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,456
"After lights are switched off
And earth is overlapped with darkness.."

486
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,960
"Still there's light in the eyes.."

487
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,160
"Even after the earth get's wet
after a rain..."

488
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,720
"Still there're few
showers of merriment left.."

489
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,160
"After urges are pacified and
desires get drowned.."

490
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,520
"Love has blossomed!"

491
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,600
"On that shore of Arabian Sea
I saw a beauty""

492
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,080
"I saw that maiden breeze.."

493
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:34,800
"Disrobing herself!"

494
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,480
- Oh it's you!
- Who else?

495
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,360
I forgot where I was

496
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,800
I got scared

497
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,520
Where're you going? What's this

498
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,560
At this time...

499
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,160
No one need come here claiming
relationship with my daughter

500
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,520
I'm not here for that

501
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,920
I want bricks, Son, ask him if I
can get them or not!

502
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,320
I want a truck load to
send to North India

503
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,480
Why come here for that?
Don't they've bricks in the North?

504
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,200
Why waste words? Ask him the price
and When can I get them?

505
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,320
One brick is 75 paise, one load is
Rs.2000, Tell him that..

506
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,240
There is Rs.1000 as advance.
I want 'Ram' inscribed on every brick.

507
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,040
- Dad, what're you saying?
- You scoundrel

508
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,000
We're building a temple for
Ram in Ayodhya

509
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,320
Each family is contributing
one brick

510
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,040
We're collecting from the villages
and sending it there

511
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,840
I should've finished you off
that day itself

512
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,280
Hold him

513
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,160
Give him Rs.3 must be alert
with this man

514
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,000
I must speak to my wife

515
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,080
I've been promoted from
proof reader to reporter

516
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,960
My pay check is better
My wife brings me luck

517
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,120
This Pankajamma knows
all about you

518
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,360
You're trying to break this
old lady's heart

519
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,440
No, I...
Traitor!

520
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,800
Pankajamma, would I betray you?

521
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,040
Come later

522
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,160
I've something to tell you

523
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
Later..

524
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,560
What can I do, if the
cooker is noisy?

525
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,720
I got scared, It's all a mess

526
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,920
You're the one who scares me

527
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,400
I only asked you for a minute

528
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,120
To tell you something important

529
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,600
I could've told you by now

530
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,400
If I keep it to myself any longer
my heart will burst

531
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,280
What's it?
Tell me

532
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,000
"There's no lock for flowers
There's no route for Air"

533
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,680
"Whom does this earth sky belongs to?
Whom we belong to?"

534
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,040
- How will we care for it?
- Allah's there... for that

535
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,120
Our child has 2 Gods
They will care for it

536
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,120
"It's a joy to talk
It's a joy to lend a hand"

537
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,080
"If we become one
happiness at its best"

538
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,200
"It's a joy to talk
It's a joy to lend a hand"

539
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,840
"If we become one
happiness at its best"

540
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:29,600
"Gardens don't have regrets
Birds never cry"

541
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:36,840
"There are no nights on Sun
There's no restriction for Heaven"

542
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,000
"Eyes are for vision only
not to shed tears"

543
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,720
"No one's ever hurt when
clouds fall on earth"

544
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,400
"Eyes are for vision only
not to shed tears"

545
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,080
"Life's there only to live
not to fall from grace"

546
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,640
"Life's there only to live
not to fall from grace"

547
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,680
"God never differentiated
Men by religion"

548
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,040
Sir wants to talk to you?

549
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,600
- Who?
- The senior

550
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,560
Your daughter's written to us
She's not my daughter

551
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,160
That's what I thought too
But they don't seem to care

552
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,120
They went away and got married

553
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,800
- And she's pregnant now
- She's pregnant?

554
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,600
She's written to us without
my son's knowledge

555
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,760
- No need to claim relationship now
- I have better things to do

556
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,600
I don't want our animosity to affect
the child, That's all

557
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,320
But remember one thing
The child will follow our faith

558
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,600
How can that be?

559
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,200
A child should follow his
father's faith

560
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,440
For you, For us, the mother's lineage
is important, So...

561
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,080
The child will be a pure
Saivite not a Muslim

562
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,400
The child shall grow up a Muslim

563
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,920
Whatever you say, it'll go only
to a temple

564
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,000
I'll make it pray 5 times a day

565
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,800
I'll make it chant our hymns

566
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,320
Let's see how that happens

567
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,040
Big talk, I won't allow him to
carry the child

568
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,960
Wait, What's all this about?

569
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,680
There're formalities to be observed
by a pregnant girl's family

570
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:53,240
Please go away or there will be an
earth quake here

571
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,520
They've come here to pay respect
Why do you send them away

572
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,200
But you don't like

573
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,920
It's not for you or me

574
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,440
It's for the unborn child
Take them inside

575
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,240
Please come in, move out
of the way

576
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,720

It's a joy to lend a hand"

586
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,920
"If we become one
happiness at its best"

587
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:02,200
"It's a joy to talk
It's a joy to lend a hand"

588
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,520
"If we become one
happiness at its best"

589
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,160
- Is your father home?
- Someone to see you, dad

590
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,200
Wait, I will see

591
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,640
We're from the Sakthi Samaj

592
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,760
We're building a Ram temple
at Ayodhya

593
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,400
We're collecting donations from
every Hindu household

594
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,360
If you can contribute
Whatever you can

595
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,280
Please step aside..
It's for the temple I know

596
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:20,840
December 6,1992 - Ayodhya

597
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,880
2 children, Did you see...

598
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,600
Our lives are in danger.
How will we notice anything?

599
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,880
What's your name?
Tell us

600
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,400
Are you a Muslim or a Hindu?

601
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,520
Burn them Give me a match-stick

602
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,960
'Intermission'

603
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,560
What's the matter?

604
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,040
Kamal, what's the matter?

605
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:36,160
What's the matter?

606
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:47,880
Go to sleep, It's just a bad dream
It'll go away

607
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,120
My body's aflame, Daddy

608
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,080
No... Nothing like that

609
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:59,760
They're setting fire to me
My body's burning

610
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,080
They're setting fire to me

611
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,680
Look... your brother's sleeping
Look, mother's here

612
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,280
Nothing will happen
I'm here, It's all over

613
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:16,120
Then why're they chasing
me everyday

614
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:17,840
No one's after you

615
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,000
Am I Hindu or a Muslim?

616
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,120
They ask me that again and again

617
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,160
Tell them not to ask me

618
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,040
It's all over, They won't bother
you again

619
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,600
Is it really over?

620
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:47,160
Dad, I don't want this ever
I beg of you, please

621
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,720
Look who's here!
Please come see.

622
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:26,560
Apart from bringing you into this world,
how've we wronged you?

623
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,680
What happened, father?

624
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,080
It's in the papers everyday

625
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,496
That the whole place is ablaze
that there are riots everywhere

626
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:37,360
Shouldn't we know whether
you're okay or not?

627
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,000
Couldn't you write?

628
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:40,880
No, I did I..

629
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,480
I'm your father, I said many
things in anger

630
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,880
I disowned you in my letter
Does that mean you have to stay aloof

631
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,200
Alright. come in
Don't stand out-side

632
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,240
I haven't come to behave
sentimentally

633
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,440
I only came to see if
my son's alive

634
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,480
I can't face another loss
before I die... So I came

635
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,680
Dad, why do you...
What is this?

636
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,960
I was so frightened

637
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,120
Do you know who this old man is?

638
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,280
You're grandpa... grandpa..

639
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,360
What's your name, little one?
Kabir Narayanan

640
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,440
- And your name?
- Kamal Basheer

641
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,920
- Just a couple of questions
- It's over

642
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,240
- 227 have died since December 6
- 56

643
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,440
Post-mortem reports show 227
Investigations show only 56 dead

644
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,280
Are the hospital reports false then?

645
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,080
Among the casualties, 75% are
innocent people

646
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,800
Don't the police care about this?

647
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,520
This was only reaction to
what happened there...

648
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,960
When the police intervene during riots
there are bound to be casualties

649
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,640
Instead of shooting below the knee
Why did the police fire above?

650
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,400
You saw it? Did you see it?
I did

651
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,360
I saw the corpses piled in the hospital
I spoke to the Doctors too

652
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,320
Police are human too, can they
stand with folded hands...

653
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,720
And watch an incensed mob hurling
petrol bombs?

654
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,920
How many have you killed
under that pretext?

655
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,680
How many lives have been
lost needlessly?

656
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,520
Don't the police care that people are
still mourning their dead?

657
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,640
If the police fire, you people protest
against police brutality

658
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,800
If they don't fire, you accuse
them of inaction

659
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,160
- 227 have died
- Only 56, That's all

660
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,080
- Don't you respect this profession?
- I do, Immensely

661
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,000
My children are alive today thanks
to a police Officer

662
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,440
I don't know whom to ask

663
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,640
I can't speak to him about it

664
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:03,320
So I'll have to ask you

665
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,480
It's taken 6 years for this old man
to hear his daughter-in-law speak

666
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,640
- He I...
- Yes!

667
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,920
Yes... tell me

668
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,040
You won't separate us, will you?

669
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,160
I know, you won't

670
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,400
But you've come after 6 years..

671
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,240
He the children are all I have

672
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,920
Please don't separate us

673
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:58,560
I won't I swear on
my grandchildren

674
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,440
Even If I wanted to
Would I succeed?

675
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:12,400
Go, girl your father-in-law's
hungry give him some food

676
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,400
Go... go my daughter

677
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:31,240
The police came and fired at
some of our comrades

678
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,400
I had painstakingly saved money
for my daughter's wedding

679
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,960
Everything was looted

680
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,720
They killed my husband right
in front of me

681
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,640
Someone's outside to meet you

682
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,800
Someone has come

683
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,280
- Come here, Kamal,
- I'm Kabir

684
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,800
Shaila, there's someone
at the door

685
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:16,600
You ignored me all these years

686
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,720
I've cried everyday these 6 years

687
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,960
Why, mother?

688
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:31,160
Even I was able to live without you
but your father couldn't

689
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,280
Please come in, Dad

690
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:12,000
What're you here for?

691
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,880
The same reason as you

692
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,800
You revealed your true colours
Didn't you?

693
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,280
You've painted the kids foreheads
with stripes

694
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:25,520
Should I hang around till you put
caps on their heads?

695
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,960
Mother wants to know if you want
tea or coffee

696
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,960
Anything is OK little one

697
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,320
Basheer is old, so less sugar
for him

698
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,520
Half their blood is ours
Remember that

699
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:42,720
Half is ours That's pure blood

700
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,960
Oh Allah!

701
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,480
Siva... Siva

702
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,080
This place seems dangerous

703
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,800
I'm thinking of taking them
back to the village

704
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,080
How can you?

705
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:54,480
Why do you think I came here
before you?

706
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,760
Are you fighting?

707
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,040
Nothing like that

708
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,120
We're from the same place
So we're just chatting

709
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,440
Mom, they're not quarreling

710
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:08,760
Let's come to an understanding
We'll take them home

711
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,520
But the children will stay with me

712
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,640
They will grow up weak vegetarians
like you

713
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:18,440
I know how they will grow up
in your house

714
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,200
Dad is here

715
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,080
Other grandpa's here

716
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,720
Both grandpas are secretly fighting

717
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,000
What's your father-in-law
and mine staying

718
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,760
Both of them want to bring
up a child

719
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,160
They're welcome to

720
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,000
How can you say that?

721
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,960
Let them suffer
We can live in peace

722
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,640
What about us then?

723
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:00,120
We can have another child

724
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,480
Oh gawd!

725
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,840
Find some other woman

726
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,240
Just one pretty little girl

727
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,800
Why suddenly?

728
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:14,960
It's been so long since
I saw you round and pregnant

729
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:20,240
I want a little girl at once
What shall we do?

730
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,800
Mom... mom

731
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,640
No hope

732
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,880
Both grandpas are quarreling
It's unbearable

733
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:30,360
You both are welcome to your respective
fathers, we don't want them

734
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,200
Tell her I want a cute little girl

735
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,080
Want a cute little girl

736
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,400
Want a cute little girl

737
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,520
Tell him he won't get one

738
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,440
You won't get one

739
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,920
"Oh! Rakkamma!!
I want a girl child"

740
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,920
"When the world sleeps
When the cock crows"

01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:53,480
"Oh! Rakkamma!!
I want a girl child"

742
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:58,720
"When the world sleeps
When the cock crows"

743
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:09,280
"Slim Rakkamma won't come... she won't
give you a girl child to pamper"

744
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:14,160
"The world has not slept
the Cock has not crowed"

745
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:19,240
"Slim Rakkamma won't come... she won't
give you a girl child to pamper"

746
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:59,000
"Rabbit likes snow the
nightingale likes Sun"

747
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,320
"Deep root likes soil"

748
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:03,640
"Hey! Father likes daughter"

"Crying child likes Milk"

751
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:14,520
"When wife is with her husband
she likes Parrot"

752
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:19,920
"Will the fish in the river shiver even
if it drenches forever"

753
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,840
"Will you get pain if
I hug you?"

754
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,800
"Hey! Give me a girl child"

755
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,640
"Enough... Leave me..."

756
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:31,640
"Hey! Give me a girl child"

757
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:32,960
"Enough... Leave me..."

758
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,640
"Switch on the light
switch your shyness"

759
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,840
"Slim Rakkamma won't come... she won't
give you a girl child to pamper"

760
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:46,080
"The world has not slept

01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:51,040
"Slim Rakkamma won't come... she won't
give you a girl child to pamper"

762
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:56,480
"The world has not slept

763
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,320
"There's no bird without Feathers"

764
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,920
"There's no lamp without vision"

765
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,600
"I'll not stay without you
Don't you understand it?"

766
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,800
"If the soul leaves the body
There won't be any life left"

767
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:59,480
"There's no language without sound"

"If there's no husband, there won't be
life for a wife"

773
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,240
"The desire in my heart"

774
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,760
"Is seen on your forehead"

775
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:21,560
"The desire in my heart"

776
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:22,960
"Is seen on your forehead"

777
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,640
"Your touching will make me to lose
my control... stay away"

778
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:36,120
"Slim Rakkamma won't come... she won't
give you a girl child to pamper"

779
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:41,280
"The world has not slept

780
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:46,600
"Slim Rakkamma won't come... she won't
give you a girl child to pamper"

781
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:51,480
"The world has not slept
the Cock has not crowed"

782
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,600
January 5, 1993 Dongri, Bombay

783
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:42,640
'2 laborers were killed in the
Dongri area in Bombay'

784
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,760
'Their bodies were mutilated
beyond recognition'

785
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,160
'This has sparked communal riots in
several areas in Bombay'

786
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,120
When will this
Hindu-Muslim riots stop?

787
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:19,160
When will this
Hindu-Muslim riots stop?

788
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,240
Why're you asking me?

789
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,040
When will the Hindu-Muslim
riots stop?

790
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,920
We're not responsible for that

791
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,640
I want Hindus and Muslims
to live in Harmony

792
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,360
But who started it all?

793
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,840
They beat up our men

794
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:45,360
Our patience is at an end
We won't remain silent any longer

795
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,640
Who started this fanaticism?
Who demolished the Babri Mosque?

796
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:56,560
If our men demolished the Babri Mosque
I'm proud of that

797
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:03,120
There's no protection for Muslim here
We're orphans

798
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,280
So, we have to take care
of ourselves

799
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,360
They're entering Muslim households
and committing atrocities

800
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,760
If we're to live her
We've to take up arms

801
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:16,160
Tell me one thing

802
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:20,040
Where do these people get
their weapons?

803
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,280
From there

804
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:27,360
80% of the people killed in the
riots were Musilms

805
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,320
The police were watching when
they demolished our mosque

806
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:33,640
While dispersing the crowd here
they shot our men, why?

807
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:39,280
Because 75% of the police belong
to the Shakthi Samaj

808
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:45,080
People who've no respect for India
can leave

809
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:49,040
Innocent people are caught in
the cross fire of ideals

810
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,560
Bombay is burning
When will this end?

811
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:58,840
Innocent people are caught in
the cross fire of ideals

812
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,200
Bombay is burning
When will this end?

813
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:11,160
It'll never end

814
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,560
Then that ogre grew as tall as
four palm trees

815
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,480
The people were frightened and
went to Ram and Lakshmana

816
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,760
They...

817
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,320
Are you feeling sleepy?

818
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,400
Where are you coming from?

819
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,880
From the Hindu prayer meeting?

820
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,680
Why did you come this side, old man?

821
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,120
What's your name?

822
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:45,560
Brothers' wait a minute
What's happening here?

823
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,600
What're you doing?
He's one of us

824
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,800
I'm telling you, he's one of us

825
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:52,840
Go

826
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,520
Let's go
Would they've stabbed us?

827
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,360
Come How can they Basheer?

828
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,440
Threatening an old man child?

829
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:16,320
- Nothing's happened
- How can you say that?

830
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,800
If you hadn't come
They'd have killed us

831
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,400
What did you tell them?

832
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,240
Nothing

833
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,400
Please tell me

834
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:27,320
I said you're my brother Come on

835
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,600
Get water

836
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,600
Get more water

837
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,840

Leave it Let's go

840
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:47,400
Let's go, leave all this

841
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,720
Dad... dad

842
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,240
Where's my father? I'll bring him
You go

843
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,600
Basheer, come

844
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,840
Basheer, come

845
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,560
- My Koran
- I'll bring it, go

846
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,600
My children!

847
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:03,680
Sir, my kids... It's dangerous
I won't go there

848
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:06,120
No, I'm a family man

849
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,840
Sir, have you seen my grandpa?

850
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,400
Sir where is the bus stand?
I don't know, get lost

851
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:41,800
Take us to our father

852
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,400
Wait, I'll send you all inside

853
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,720
Did you search properly?
I did

854
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:36,880
What were they wearing?

855
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,920
Kabir was wearing white
Pyjama Kurta

856
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:41,760
Banu, what was Kamal wearing?

857
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,840
Blue shorts and yellow T-shirt

858
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:47,400
Don't cry, you will definitely
find your children

859
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,480
I know

860
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:53,880
I believe

861
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:14,360
"Stop..stop..stop.."

862
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:20,680
"Stop..stop..stop.."

863
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:24,760
"This is our motherland
This is our lovable country"

864
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:27,760
"Why are you shedding blood
on this land?"

865
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:31,200
"It's not written in religions.
It's not called 'Fate'!"

866
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:34,480
"This foolishness is the brainchild
of misguided people"

867
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,520
"Stop this war!"

868
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,760
"Stop this bloodshed!"

869
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:42,440
"Stop this war!"

870
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:45,840
"Stop this bloodshed!"

871
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:08,520
"You're not a Hindu
you're not a Muslim"

872
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:11,800
"You're an Indian"

873
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,920
"Religion may be different
but blood is the same"

874
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,320
"Bear this in mind be an Indian"

875
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,160
"Stop this fighting"

876
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,640
"Stop this bloodshed"

877
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,000
I've been looking for
you everywhere

878
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,280
Can't you see what's
happening outside?

879
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,080
And you're sitting here

880
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,560
Where're my children?

881
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,000
What are they doing?

882
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,560
They're not here

883
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,680
Your children are somewhere
out there

884
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,680
Get up, come

885
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,960
My children will come here

886
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,320
They will come here looking for me

887
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:17,920
I won't leave this place
without them

888
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:20,840
If we don't have we won't
live to see our children

889
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,920
I want Kamal Kabir

890
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,960
Mother's Saree

891
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:04,960
What happened?
My father

892
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:07,840
What happened to him?

893
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,080
What happened to your father?

894
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,080
Can't you see for yourself?

895
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,200
They saved us, but they're gone

896
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,720
Run away from here

897
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,400
Clear the roads otherwise

898
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,440
We will shoot

899
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,920
Listen carefully!

900
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,160
Anyone stepping out of his house will
be responsible for his own demise

901
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,400
What're you doing here?
Where's your house?

902
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:56,800
You don't come, I'll go

903
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:59,480
I've to look for my children

904
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:01,680
My children Are twins

905
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:03,240
More than 6 children are dead

906
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:06,320
Many are critically wounded.
See if your kids are amongst them.

907
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,840
My children aren't here

908
01:57:57,240 --> 01:58:00,480
So many people's children are...

909
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:05,560
Why's this happening?
Please, don't cry

910
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:07,440
Why should they suffer?

911
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:12,080
Such small children

912
01:58:16,240 --> 01:58:17,760
My babies...

913
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,920
Kill them, don't let anyone escape

914
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:43,200
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

915
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,376
Do you know what you're doing?

916
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,520
He's a Hindu, Shekhar

917
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,240
Kill me too, I am also Hindu

918
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,800
They're destroying our shops
and houses

919
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,640
They want to destroy us
or drive us out of the country

920
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:55,320
Don't talk of your people
and my people

921
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,200
This Hindu-Muslim camaraderie
will never work anymore

922
01:58:58,240 --> 01:58:59,520
Why are you talking like this?

923
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:00,760
He belongs to Sakthi Samaj

924
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,560
Ask him, didn't they seek out
Muslim houses to destroy?

925
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:05,360
Yes, with no regrets

926
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,360
They think they can lord over us

927
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,800
One Law for them, one for others
Enough of this nonsense

928
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:13,280
Politicians are scared of them
They give them minority privileges

929
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,400
This is India, not Pakistan You've to be
put in your places

930
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,680
Stop this!

931
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,080
A true Muslim won't stop

932
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:20,640
A true Hindu won't remain silent

933
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:22,480
You're a true Hindu and
You're a true Muslim

934
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,400
You're not the only one's getting hurt

935
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,040
Look around you

936
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,040
Look

937
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,680
Look around you

938
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:33,280
Why should innocent people like us die
because of fanatics like you?

939
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:34,480
What did we do wrong?

940
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,720
You forget you're a Hindu

941
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:36,720
No, I'm not a Hindu

942
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,200
Your children are half Muslim

943
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,240
No, my children are not Muslims

944
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,160
We aren't anything

945
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:45,360
We're just Indians

946
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,640
Does your Koran tell you to
kill Hindus

947
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,600
Does your Gita tell you to
kill Muslims?

948
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,000
Why all this killing?

949
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:57,640
My children are missing
because of you

950
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,160
If anything happens to them...

951
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:02,920
a Hindu like you Muslim
like you are responsible

952
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:06,600
Get lost both of you

953
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:28,040
Why're Hindus and Muslims
fighting like this?

954
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,600
I don't know, son!

955
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:32,680
They were friends this long

956
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,640
Suddenly they're killing each other

957
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:38,080
Who's at fault?

958
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,760
No one's at fault

959
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:43,120
They rake up some issues
We only get affected

960
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:46,080
We're the victims of the strategies
of the powerful people

961
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:50,640
Here, eat this

962
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:56,560
What does being Hindu
or Muslim mean?

963
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:01,800
You are asking big questions
of this eunuch

964
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,840
I don't know if I'm a
Hindu or Muslim

965
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:10,480
You eat

966
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,600
Religion is one way of reaching God

967
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:22,440
Hinduism is one way

968
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:26,920
Then why're both fighting?

969
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,240
That's what I don't know, son

970
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:43,560
I want my mother

971
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,560
Brother, eat this

972
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:14,640
What's your name?

973
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:16,520
Shaila Banu

974
02:02:17,080 --> 02:02:18,520
What's the matter?

975
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,920
What's the matter?

976
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,040
What's the matter?

977
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:28,960
What's the matter?

978
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,200
My children...

979
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,480
They're asking me to search
among the corpses

980
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:41,040
Look patiently for about 5 minutes

981
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:43,160
Say they aren't there
That's enough

982
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:44,200
Come

983
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,440
Stay here I'll see to it

984
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:03,960
What is all this?

985
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:35,760
"This is our own dear motherland"

986
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:38,680
"What's the reason for all
this bloodshed?"

987
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:40,320
"Religion does not preach it"

988
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:42,000
"Fate does not decree it"

989
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:45,160
"Is this all the devious
work of man?"

990
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,160
"Stop this fighting"

991
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,480
"Stop this bloodshed"

992
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:53,600
"Stop this fighting"

993
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,960
"Stop this bloodshed"

994
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,640
Enough of all this

995
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:56,000
There's only blood and burnt flesh
after the carnage

996
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:02,360
Stop in the name of God

997
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:19,000
I beg of you to stop all this

998
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:24,840
Stop

999
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:28,720
Stop, I'll not spare you

1000
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:35,400
Stop

1001
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:41,800
I beg of you, there are children here
Go away

1002
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:46,560
For God's sake, stop all
this bloodshed

1003
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:49,680
There's been too much of it
Enough of this

1004
02:08:49,720 --> 02:08:51,000
The City has burned enough

1005
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,000
Burn him

1006
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:55,840
Go ahead

1007
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,320
I won't give way
I'll not allow you

1008
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,576
Can't you understand someone's instigating
this unnecessary conflict?

1009
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:05,760
Why do you kill each other then?

1010
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:09,520
Politicians are setting the place ablaze
and watching the spectacle

1011
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:13,440
Hooligans are looting the people

1012
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,040
The bigwigs are causing this
religious conflict

1013
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:18,160
Kill them first then come here

1014
02:09:18,200 --> 02:09:26,200
Throw away these weapons

1015
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:31,080
You're a Muslim too Kill him

1016
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:34,440
Burn this fool first

1017
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:35,960
Yes, burn me

1018
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:39,800
Stop this, please listen to me

1019
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:42,960
Set fire to me

1020
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:47,120
Burn me

1021
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:51,400
You want to kill someone
Kill me, you murderers

1022
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,880
- Burn me
- No

1023
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:56,080
Burn me

1024
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:57,560
No

1025
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,120
Burn me

1026
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:03,640
This is my child

1027
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:07,680
And this is my sister

1028
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,560
Dad!

1029
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,320
Dad!...!

1030
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:18,600
"When flowers are joining together,
why people are fighting with each other?"

1031
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:24,320
"Let the madness of religious
fanaticism be buried"

1032
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:29,480
"Let the world find
solace in religion"

1033
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:38,800
"When flowers are joining together,
why people are fighting with each other?"

1034
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:44,640
"Let the madness of religious
fanaticism be buried"

1035
02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:50,080
"Let the world find solace in religion"

1036
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:56,360
