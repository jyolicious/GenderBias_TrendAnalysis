1
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:24,095
Attention!

2
00:02:29,573 --> 00:02:31,422
Stand at ease!

3
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,787
Major Vijay Malhotra reporting sir.

4
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:37,250
- Come. Sit down.
- Thank you.

5
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:41,817
- Yes Vijay?
- Sir.

6
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,365
The truck carrying arms to the border
Met with an accident last month.

7
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:49,233
And the task to enquire
the fire in the jeep,

8
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,101
I've prepared its' report.

9
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:55,577
- So what's the outcome?
- It was a plan not an accident.

10
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:57,969
The aim of being stealing of arms.

11
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:03,757
Means our people are involved.
Must hand the case to intelligence.

12
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,954
I have a request.
The truck that is to leave tomorrow

13
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,522
give me the responsibility of taking
it to the border security force.

14
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:16,687
If this happens again,
the arms looters will be uncontrollable.

15
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:17,507
Okay.

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Why doesn't this plane fly?

17
00:03:22,727 --> 00:03:26,590
What are you saying, son?
Do toys ever fly?

18
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:28,675
Buy me a flying plane.

19
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:31,567
First grow up. Then you'll see

20
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:36,343
you'll have more planes
than people have cars. Go.

21
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:40,145
For the time being, make do with this.

22
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,727
If you fill A, B, C...
in his mind instead of this

23
00:03:45,377 --> 00:03:47,359
he'd learn to write his name.

24
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:51,695
He will learn.
The alphabets are not leaving India.

25
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,656
But look at his age.

26
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:55,220
He's grown so big.

27
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:58,159
You neither showed him a
book, nor did he see a school.

28
00:03:58,505 --> 00:03:59,678
Aren't you at all worried?

29
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:05,319
Buy a couple of buffaloes with
the money you'll spend on books.

30
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:09,013
The boy will drink milk
and become as tough as us!

31
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:11,694
He'll become as clever as brother.
You won't believe it.

32
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,775
- What is it?
- Sir has called for an urgent meeting.

33
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,268
What meeting?

34
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,179
Nothing as such but he
has called everybody.

35
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,817
BALDEV: Subhedar Pratap Singh has come.

36
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:33,208
That's fine but what about the cash
for the arms we gave last time?

37
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,772
He's given this bag full!

38
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:41,562
- How much is it?
- I can't count much.

39
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,660
I'll weigh it if you say.
Must be 7 or 8 kilos with the bag.

40
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:49,962
No need. You wait at the corner,

41
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,247
- I'll change and come.
- Okay.

42
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,134
Are you doing the duty for which the
government gave you this uniform?

43
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:05,562
Of course! That's what I'm doing!

44
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:08,457
You were but no more!

45
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:11,532
Earlier 3000 rupees used to come
on the first of every month.

46
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:14,457
Now millions come at any date!

47
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,376
I am asking, why? What do we lack?

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,549
What an illiterate woman!
I want to live, enjoy!

49
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,125
By selling your country?

50
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:29,833
Do you want me to spend
all my life carrying a gun?

51
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,991
And die at the enemy's hand someday?

52
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,130
You want to be a widow?

53
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,937
That widow is better than a woman

54
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,101
whose husband is a martyr for the nation.

55
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:43,576
I can bare to see you dying by a bullet.

56
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:47,493
But I can't bare the
stigma of a traitor on you!

57
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,167
- Shanti!
- I am saying it for the last time

58
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,721
don't be loyal to me.

59
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:57,093
But if you're disloyal to your
country, I won't forgive you!

60
00:05:58,293 --> 00:06:00,842
- Mother!
- Don't try to teach me!

61
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:03,329
I can leave my wife for money!

62
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:14,277
Subhedar Pratap Singh has come.

63
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:19,745
What's the matter?
DK always meets after delivery of arms.

64
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:23,330
What meeting is this beforehand?

65
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:39,185
I've called this meeting

66
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:46,917
because the truck of arms which is
going to the border with you tomorrow,

67
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,912
you can't loot it easily.

68
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:58,647
- Why?
- Because... another in charge is coming.

69
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:02,173
Major Vijay Malhotra.

70
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:04,542
How did you find out?

71
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:09,432
From our fourth partner,
Jaswant Dalal, Major's driver.

72
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,335
He is a very strict officer.

73
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:17,011
With him around,
forget trucks we can't steal a nail!

74
00:07:17,052 --> 00:07:20,105
Opportunity never strikes again.

75
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:27,627
The truck carries latest arms worth
10 crores that sell like hot cakes.

76
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:31,879
Each of us 4 partners can earn 2.5 crores.

77
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,027
2.5 crores?

78
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:39,050
Let it happened anything,
we will have those weapons.

79
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,957
Best of luck gentlemen.

80
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:36,598
The soldiers who play
with guns and cannons

81
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:42,702
do not fear the police's
revolver, Mr. Dinesh.

82
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:51,971
I came stealthily yet you found me out.

83
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,429
We soldiers have 4 not 2 eyes.

84
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,303
- Oh brother, you...
- Hello.

85
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,050
How come you came suddenly?

86
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,892
Mr. Dinesh Kapoor.
Sub-inspector of police.

87
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,997
I've come from Delhi to
give you some good news.

88
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:10,947
- What is that?
- Not now.

89
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:15,837
First some good piping hot
breakfast, then the news.

90
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:19,053
- Done.
- The good news is I've been promoted.

91
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,426
I have to join duty in
Bombay Within a week.

92
00:09:22,467 --> 00:09:24,925
- Wow! Congratulations.
- Thank you.

93
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,219
- Dinu. All the best.
- Thank you.

94
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:32,067
And to celebrate we're going
to Simla by evening flight.

95
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,275
Here are the tickets.

96
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,051
Mr. Vijay Malhotra, Mrs. Geeta Malhotra

97
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,902
master Raju Malhotra
and Mr. Dinesh Kapoor.

98
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:41,910
Dinu.

99
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:43,647
We won't be able to go.

100
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:48,027
I'd promised Raju we'll go to a
hill station if he stands first.

101
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,592
Trucks with arms are going to the border.

102
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:55,422
- I'm in charge of it.
- Hand it to somebody else.

103
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:58,535
If it was given by an officer
I would have done this.

104
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:03,061
But I've asked for this assignment.

105
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,867
You've ruined my plan.

106
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,208
Doesn't matter.
I'll go to Bombay today itself.

107
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,425
Jaswant Dalal reporting sir.

108
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,385
- The jeep is ready sir.
- Wait for me.

109
00:10:38,735 --> 00:10:39,349
Stop the jeep.

110
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:43,947
Driver, take it reverse.

111
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:47,783
Sir.

112
00:10:49,512 --> 00:10:50,352
Why have you stopped the truck?

113
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,964
There's an oil leak.
So the wheel is jammed.

114
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,788
I'll try to contact headquarters.

115
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:16,652
Hello. Hello.

116
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:18,298
What's wrong with the wireless?

117
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,096
- Listen.
- Sir.

118
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,395
Some soldiers will remain
here with you for security.

119
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:24,904
Sir.

120
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:27,402
The rest will come with me.

121
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,893
- I'll get help from the nearby station.
- Sir.

122
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,236
- Any doubts?
- No, Sir.

123
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:15,316
Back.

124
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:22,357
Quickly.

125
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,237
Pile it in.

126
00:12:57,553 --> 00:12:58,745
Bastards!

127
00:13:00,618 --> 00:13:04,191
These weapons are not bought from
the gold in a king's treasury!

128
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:12,238
But by the sweat and
blood of 90 crore Indians!

129
00:13:13,348 --> 00:13:16,941
You swore to protect the
country but you loot it!

130
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:22,123
It's a shame for this uniform
to be draped on your body!

131
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:27,965
You'll get only some copper or
bronze medals by arresting us.

132
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,271
Become our partner.
We'll give you one half!

133
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:37,120
You want to buy me off!

134
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:38,638
Bastard!

135
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:43,754
Who are not on sale? Everybody is for sale.
At their own price.

136
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:47,683
What will we soldiers do in this
environment by being honest?

137
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:48,658
Silence!

138
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:52,195
Our nation is safe because of our honesty!

139
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:53,953
Or it would lose its' identity!

140
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:57,223
People don't sleep because the sun sets.

141
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,955
It's because we guard the border
when the country sleeps in peace!

142
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:04,618
If we sell our honesty

143
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,791
another color will fly
in place of our tricolor!

144
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,559
You are under arrest!

145
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,213
Hey, get up.

146
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:54,040
Sir, a fax from Interpol, Australia.

147
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:57,515
Send a message to ACP Dinesh Kapoor.

148
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:59,293
For an urgent meeting.

149
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:05,764
- Good morning sir.
- Morning.

150
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,362
Please sit down.

151
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,523
Jaswant Dalal reporting sir.

152
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:23,100
This is Jaswant Dalal.
We've got a message from Australia.

153
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:25,911
He deals in illegal arms smuggling.

154
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,301
He's coming to Bombay
by a cargo ship today.

155
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:36,651
If we arrest him, we can find out
about illegal arms smuggling here.

156
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:42,523
I've called for a secret meeting
so nobody outside hears about it.

157
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:47,600
Otherwise people attached to
him, who'll suffer by his arrest

158
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,823
will have to kill him.

159
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:55,828
You'll be in charge of the
operation to nab Jaswant.

160
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:00,988
And I want him alive
under any circumstance!

161
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:02,466
Okay, sir.

162
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:47,780
VICKY: Hello.

163
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,921
- Got the fax?
- VICKY: Yes.

164
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:53,488
The police want him alive.

165
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,428
You know what you have to do.

166
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:02,134
Remember he must not get into
the police's hands alive.

167
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:07,461
- DINESH: I cannot help you in this.
- VICKY: All right.

168
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:20,053
- Is everything ready?
- Yes sir.

169
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:21,342
He can't escape.

170
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,533
There are more policemen
than workers here.

171
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:34,352
Sir.

172
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,554
Jaswant has come.
Shall we begin the movement?

173
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:42,914
Yes!

174
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,395
Who are you? What do you want?

175
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:07,845
- To save your life.
- Whom do I fear?

176
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:10,445
Whom every criminal fears.

177
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:13,544
The ones outside are
the police not workers.

178
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,315
Police?

179
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:21,559
The police can be recognized
by their shoes not clothes.

180
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:28,413
If you want to get out of here

181
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,199
do as I say.

182
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:32,124
Okay.

183
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:39,440
Sir. Jaswant is not to be seen.

184
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,327
Nobody here.

185
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:03,454
Hello!

186
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,241
Jaswant is in the container
that is being off loaded!

187
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:09,198
There's another man with him!

188
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:13,111
Should we surround the container?

189
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:15,495
- Hello!
- Hello!

190
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,018
- Yes.
- All units alert!

191
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,658
Surround the container being off loaded.

192
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:32,801
- Stop the container!
- Stop the container!

193
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:43,693
Bring the container down.

194
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,710
Nobody will fire. We want him alive.

195
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:46,051
Good.

196
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:12,779
So far I did what you said.

197
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,119
Now you'll do what I say.

198
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:17,019
Stop the car.

199
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:21,683
Stop.

200
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:30,146
Out.

201
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,296
Come on.

202
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:43,011
Hands up.

203
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,632
Move.

204
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:52,810
Good.

205
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:56,274
You're very useful man but my principle is

206
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:59,521
job finished, man finished.

207
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:26,821
And my principle is man
finished, job finished.

208
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:29,773
I want the killer not your sorry!

209
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:33,924
Seal all the ways of going out.

210
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:39,069
And remember he should not
leave the city! Got it!

211
00:25:02,007 --> 00:25:03,709
- One Minta Car Road please.
- Yes.

212
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,624
- Are you an Indian?
- You recognised me?

213
00:25:10,536 --> 00:25:11,660
- No.
- No?

214
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:15,794
- Now?
- No.

215
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:21,634
No, I didn't recognize you.

216
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,422
- Why you started crying?
- It's a sad story.

217
00:25:34,963 --> 00:25:37,279
Once there was a fair of Kumbh.

218
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,342
- In Australia?
- No, India.

219
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:42,484
I have a twin brother named Sohan.
I'm Mohan.

220
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:45,108
He was left and I right

221
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,658
- and in the center was...
- Your mom.

222
00:25:46,782 --> 00:25:51,512
My dad. We were happily
going when all of a sudden

223
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,397
- he ran away with my bag.
- Who, your Dad?

224
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:54,845
No, a thief.

225
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:56,540
I am helpless.

226
00:25:56,637 --> 00:25:59,210
I screamed, Dad!
He's running away with the bag!

227
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,069
- He ran after him.
- Who, your Dad?

228
00:26:01,222 --> 00:26:03,901
My brother was behind the thief.

229
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:08,495
They were running and I screamed
and he fell with a thud!

230
00:26:08,543 --> 00:26:09,829
- Your brother?
- My Dad!

231
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,952
He was drunk and the police caught him.

232
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:15,717
- The thief?
- My Dad!

233
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:18,642
- And started beating him.
- But why?

234
00:26:18,747 --> 00:26:21,717
They thought he was the thief.
In the meantime he ran away!

235
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,264
- The thief?
- My brother!

236
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,872
Since then I'm looking for him.

237
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,829
- The thief?
- No! My brother!

238
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,656
But if he was lost in India why
are you looking for him here?

239
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,370
That was different. He ran away.

240
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:40,145
He had two hobbies,
to see kangaroos and pick pockets.

241
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:43,474
Tell me, is any place better
than trams to pick pockets?

242
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:45,695
That's why I took this job.

243
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:50,164
I thought someday he'll come here
to pick pocket and I'll see him.

244
00:26:50,457 --> 00:26:52,092
And I'll meet him. It's come!

245
00:26:52,602 --> 00:26:54,372
- Your brother?
- No, your station!

246
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,572
Oh!

247
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,548
Listen! Listen! Listen!

248
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,175
If you ever see that
rascal whom I'm looking for

249
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:07,340
- give him my card.
- Whom? The thief?

250
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,034
To my brother, Sohan!

251
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:12,559
Turned my head round!

252
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,373
- He is turning my head!
- What me?

253
00:27:14,397 --> 00:27:17,096
No! He.

254
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,067
"He appears in my dreams."

255
00:28:37,524 --> 00:28:38,924
"He drives my sleep away."

256
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:41,708
"He appears in my dreams.
He drives my sleep away."

257
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:44,044
"He makes my heart pound,
he drives me out of my senses."

258
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,887
"My beloved."

259
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,272
"My beloved"

260
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:57,497
"will come someday."

261
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,830
"My beloved."

262
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,878
"What mischief has taken over?
I'm dazzled."

263
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:29,204
"Even when I look into... I feel shy."

264
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:33,342
"My beauty has blossomed"

265
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:37,149
"like the Sun coming out
from behind the clouds."

266
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:41,544
"It's the intoxication f a first love"

267
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:45,291
"that clouds my eyes."

268
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:49,096
"He torments me, he drives me wayward."

269
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:51,482
"He torments me, he drives me wayward"

270
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:53,911
"he sets my heart pounding,
he drives me out of senses."

271
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:01,208
"My beloved"

272
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:07,529
"will come someday."

273
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,050
"My beloved."

274
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,301
"To kiss my lips"

275
00:30:49,477 --> 00:30:51,354
"to take my hand"

276
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:55,641
"he will someday come to me."

277
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,795
"My beloved, my sweetheart."

278
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,920
"He will look better than the moon."

279
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:07,915
"I'll ask him to take me away"

280
00:31:08,273 --> 00:31:11,573
"in a bridal palanquin."

281
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:15,528
"He holds me in his arms,
he possesses me in his breath."

282
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:17,917
"He holds me in his arms,
he possesses me in his breath"

283
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,303
"he sets my heart pounding,
he drives me out of senses."

284
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:27,448
"My beloved."

285
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:33,933
"Will come someday."

286
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,328
"My beloved."

287
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:42,142
Who will be Miss Valentine in
today's function at the club?

288
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:43,223
Me.

289
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:46,193
- Why are you laughing?

290
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:47,680
Oh my God! Accident!

291
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,320
- Oh shit!
- My tail light!

292
00:31:52,482 --> 00:31:54,119
This was my new car!

293
00:31:54,143 --> 00:31:57,622
- Cool down. Cool down.
- Oh my God! Oh my God!

294
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:01,200
You damaged my car!

295
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:05,669
Why do you drive abroad
when you don't know driving!

296
00:32:05,863 --> 00:32:07,717
Why don't you drive bullock
carts in your own country?

297
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:11,542
These days Indians drive pilot planes,
jet rockets and space shuttles!

298
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:15,720
You braked and the car stopped.
I braked and my car didn't.

299
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:18,210
- It's a little thing.
- Little thing?

300
00:32:18,252 --> 00:32:22,080
So it may be big. But not so big
that Vicky can't compensate for it!

301
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:26,415
How much? 50, 100, 200, 300 400, 500?

302
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,292
You'll remember you met a wealthy Indian!

303
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:31,945
- Here.

304
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,696
- Thank you.
- You stupid!

305
00:32:34,051 --> 00:32:35,880
How dare you touch me!

306
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,697
Dress like a modern girl
and talk like an old woman!

307
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:46,028
- Police! Police! Police!
- Excuse me.

308
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:50,574
Madam this is Australia not India.
You can't stop and talk midway.

309
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,294
Go and talk about love in a garden
Sing, dance, makes no difference.

310
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,535
Try to understand my problem.

311
00:32:56,632 --> 00:33:00,650
We're not talking about love.
He crashed my car.

312
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,257
- Look. Please arrest him.
- Oh.

313
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,055
Both of you will have to
come to the police station.

314
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:08,032
Preeti? Why are you wasting time?

315
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,526
Officer? We take back our complaint.

316
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,397
- Very intelligent girl.
- Thank you. Thank you.

317
00:33:13,437 --> 00:33:16,394
This is understanding.
You lose some to gain some.

318
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,817
Try to understand my problem. Okay?

319
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:20,326
I'll see you.

320
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,247
When and where?

321
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:22,231
Shut up!

322
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:33,269
She...

323
00:33:33,731 --> 00:33:34,920
- You?
- Yes, me.

324
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:38,429
- You have a twin?
- Yes.

325
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,996
- Who was lost in the Kumbh fair?
- Yes.

326
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:42,757
- I met him.
- Where?

327
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:45,629
He's a tram conductor.
He is Searching you.

328
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:49,756
That tram conducter is me. Mohan.

329
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:55,906
You're talking about Sohan. I thought...

330
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:59,992
He must have graduated
from picking pockets.

331
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:03,676
And he'll steal somebody's car
and break the signal to escape.

332
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:05,429
And I'll catch him.

333
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:07,927
So I became a traffic policeman.

334
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:11,480
Why did you make kumbh fairs, Lord?

335
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:18,787
No! No! No! Yes! Yes! Go! Go! Come, come!

336
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,279
Friends, friends, friends.

337
00:34:26,324 --> 00:34:27,705
Today is Valentine's day.

338
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,722
A day for lovers.

339
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:37,005
You all know, we in India Club
choose a Mr and Miss. Valentine.

340
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,221
And this years' Miss Valentine is.

341
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,778
Ms. Preeti.

342
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:46,507
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

343
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:47,971
Preeti, please come up.

344
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:50,890
- Welcome and congratulations.
- Thanks.

345
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:56,086
Friends, amongst you whoever
answers 3 of Preeti's questions

346
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,048
he will be chosen Mister Valentine!

347
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:03,307
He will get an opportunity to dance

348
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,757
and kiss Miss Valentine's hand!

349
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:12,405
Quiet, quiet, quiet please.

350
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:14,683
She sets one small condition.

351
00:35:15,397 --> 00:35:17,785
If you can't answer her questions

352
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:23,077
you'll have her pretty
sandal not her hands to kiss!

353
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,887
What's the matter?
Can none among you answer her questions?

354
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,207
I'll give answer.

355
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:37,435
- Vicky!
- Well, give him a big hand.

356
00:35:38,978 --> 00:35:42,427
Think again. If you lose
you'll have to kiss her sandal.

357
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:47,467
Don't worry.
One who is kissable from head to toe

358
00:35:48,562 --> 00:35:50,062
her head and toe are the same.

359
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:52,965
Ask the question.

360
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:58,867
First question.
What is her favorite fruit?

361
00:35:59,393 --> 00:36:01,911
The sweetest fruit is of labor.

362
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:05,406
But Miss Valentine is
miles away from hard work.

363
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:09,547
So her favorite fruit can't be
mango, sweet lime or orange.

364
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,072
Because you have to peel it to eat it.

365
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:18,175
Her favorite fruit is one that can
be popped in the mouth and swallowed.

366
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:20,160
That is grapes.

367
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:22,656
Right. Absolutely right.

368
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:27,202
Thank you. Thank you.

369
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:29,143
Next question please.

370
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:34,304
Next question. What's her favorite sport?

371
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,904
Man likes games according to his nature.

372
00:36:38,844 --> 00:36:41,573
And her nature... fight, fight and fight!

373
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:45,667
So she likes WWF wrestling.

374
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:48,810
Wonderful! This is the right answer.

375
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,789
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:54,450
Tell him to answer simply.
Why is he beating round the bush?

377
00:36:54,474 --> 00:36:57,450
So what? He's answering right!

378
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:02,960
Next please.

379
00:37:05,055 --> 00:37:06,884
Now the last question.

380
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,100
Which of the 7 wonders is her favorite?

381
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:15,364
I'll have to answer this
in a roundabout manner.

382
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:16,605
Yes, Yes, It Will do!

383
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:22,345
The wonder she likes is very
different from her nature.

384
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,162
She hates the word love.

385
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:29,152
But likes the wonder
that is a symbol of love.

386
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:31,739
The symbol of love. Taj Mahal.

387
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:32,613
And he is right.

388
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:37,282
This year's Mister Valentine is Vicky!

389
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:39,307
Thank you. Thank you.

390
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:43,245
She asked three ordinary questions.

391
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:48,224
If she had to ask anything today it
should have been of heart and love.

392
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,055
I would even answer that.

393
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:53,127
What's in her heart.

394
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:55,379
My foot!

395
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:59,975
The heart in you is Indian.

396
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,679
And Indian heart is not a loafer.

397
00:38:03,435 --> 00:38:05,257
It likes the whole world.

398
00:38:05,474 --> 00:38:07,235
But belongs to an Indian.

399
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,175
All of you can participate
in today's Valentine Day.

400
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:16,499
Come on Preeti. Come on Vicky.

401
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:04,329
"Oh the colour of your
skin, oh your gait."

402
00:39:04,463 --> 00:39:08,152
"Oh your beauty, oh your cheeks."

403
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:11,666
"One look at you, and I fell in love."

404
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:14,398
"My heart was lost to you."

405
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:18,066
"Oh no."

406
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,404
"No, I don't want your heart."

407
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:24,741
"No, I don't want your heart."

408
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:30,015
"No, I don't want your heart."

409
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:33,344
"You're not the last man for me."

410
00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:37,612
"You're not the last man for me."

411
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:51,042
"Come to me, my love...
that'd be gracious of you."

412
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:01,253
"Liar! You are evil at heart."

413
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:25,818
"Your blouse hugs you
tightly, your scarf flies."

414
00:40:28,982 --> 00:40:32,436
"Your blouse hugs you
tightly, your scarf flies"

415
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:36,348
"come my Indian beauty, become my Queen."

416
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:43,351
"I'm a girl from Punjab,
I flaunt a silk scarf."

417
00:40:45,804 --> 00:40:49,634
"I'm a girl from Punjab,
I flaunt a silk scarf."

418
00:40:49,675 --> 00:40:53,602
"I'll teach you a lesson you
won't forget all your life."

419
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:59,326
"Oh no."

420
00:40:59,365 --> 00:41:02,941
"Oh no, I can't do without you."

421
00:41:02,965 --> 00:41:06,251
"No, I can't do without you."

422
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:09,847
"No, I can't do without you."

423
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:14,812
"The sight of you sends
my spirits soaring."

424
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:18,920
"The sight of you sends
my spirits soaring."

425
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:39,118
"Don't stare at me.
Don't wear your heart on your sleeve."

426
00:41:39,323 --> 00:41:43,052
"Let me go... don't bother me."

427
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:46,339
"He's mad to fall in love."

428
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:49,645
"Take care of him...
he's of no use anymore."

429
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:56,333
"Oh my love, my sweetheart."

430
00:41:56,551 --> 00:42:00,098
"Oh for her consent and for her refusal."

431
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:03,130
"I set my eyes on you and fell in love."

432
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,502
"I've lost my heart to you."

433
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:09,937
"Oh no!"

434
00:42:09,976 --> 00:42:13,373
"Oh no, I don't want your heart."

435
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:16,891
"Oh no, I can't do without you."

436
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:20,807
"No, I can't do without you"

437
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,084
I can't do without you".

438
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:25,325
"The sight of you sends
my spirits soaring."

439
00:42:25,365 --> 00:42:28,715
"No, I can't do without you."

440
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:32,302
"The sight of you sends
my spirits soaring."

441
00:42:32,326 --> 00:42:36,698
"No, I can't do without you."

442
00:42:56,888 --> 00:42:59,565
You just see Sheetal, I won't leave him!

443
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:05,498
Don't ever leave him!
He's so handsome, so intelligent.

444
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:09,091
Shut up! Just because
he answered my questions

445
00:43:09,608 --> 00:43:11,475
you think that fool is intelligent!

446
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:16,949
He's great.
He even said what I hadn't told him.

447
00:43:17,154 --> 00:43:21,702
- You told him all this?
- Yes!

448
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:27,886
I won't spare you! Stop!

449
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:53,484
'Destination is nearby'

450
00:43:58,724 --> 00:43:59,559
Good luck.

451
00:44:11,724 --> 00:44:17,415
'Your next destination.
Little India restaurant, table no 7'

452
00:44:37,516 --> 00:44:38,243
Waiter.

453
00:44:39,706 --> 00:44:41,556
- Yes sir?
- Which is table 7?

454
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,944
That one.

455
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:45,683
But don't sit there.

456
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,408
- Here's your best drink.
- Thanks.

457
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:02,723
I'm sorry sir.

458
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:05,566
- You?
- Yes.

459
00:45:05,896 --> 00:45:08,723
- You have a brother? Twin?
- Yes.

460
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:11,948
- He's searching for you all over.
- Where is he?

461
00:45:12,256 --> 00:45:13,478
He's become a traffic policeman.

462
00:45:13,823 --> 00:45:17,881
- Traff... That was me.
- But you were in the police.

463
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:19,285
Yes. I was in police.

464
00:45:19,694 --> 00:45:23,363
I tried that job too but
Mohan didn't meet Sohan.

465
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:27,173
So I became a waiter. He loved one thing

466
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:30,023
of seeing dances.
And English dances are shown here.

467
00:45:30,255 --> 00:45:34,170
So I joined here.
Someday he will come here, I think.

468
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:36,353
No. No.

469
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:39,435
- Please don't sit on this table.
- Wow! Vicky!

470
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:41,728
Please sit on any other table.

471
00:45:41,767 --> 00:45:42,758
- Oh my god!
- I beg of you.

472
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:47,678
He's come here!
Did you tell him we're coming here?

473
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,666
I swear this time I didn't tell him.

474
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:54,412
You can't sit here because
this is Jojo's table.

475
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,295
Who is he?

476
00:45:56,956 --> 00:45:59,378
The son of the most dangerous man here.

477
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:02,723
He always keeps smiling.

478
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:07,065
- Something like this.
- It's good for health.

479
00:46:07,368 --> 00:46:12,953
I know that but when he stops
laughing other's health suffers.

480
00:46:13,554 --> 00:46:16,729
When somebody else sits on his
table, he stops laughing.

481
00:46:16,753 --> 00:46:17,954
Then you know what happens?

482
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:19,230
So what happens?

483
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:24,503
This. Their only fault
was sitting at this table.

484
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:28,758
Jojo saw it and thrashed them.

485
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,258
- Idea. Sheetal.
- Yes?

486
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:33,341
No better chance to get him beaten.

487
00:46:33,578 --> 00:46:36,195
Hope nothing goes wrong.

488
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,781
- If I get him beaten?
- Bet 100 bucks!

489
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:41,505
Bet! Yes!

490
00:46:41,594 --> 00:46:44,764
I don't want a nice man like
yourself's picture be stuck here.

491
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:47,768
Get up my Pop! Or he'll throw you out.

492
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:49,246
- Hi Vicky!
- Listen to me.

493
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:56,243
Great! Did the sun rise in the west?

494
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:57,623
May I join you please?

495
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:00,931
- Sure, sit.
- No!

496
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:06,593
Don't join on this table or
your joints will be disjointed.

497
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,918
Please join at another table.

498
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,611
Mohan, What's going on?
Don't you know how to talk to customers?

499
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:16,778
- This is table 7.
- So what?

500
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:18,938
That's Jojo's table.

501
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:23,745
Why are you standing here?
It's time for Jojo. Get his order.

502
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,833
Who?

503
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:26,462
Jojo!

504
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:32,041
I'm the hotel manager.
Please get up from here.

505
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:37,388
- If this table is reserved.
- You should have kept a reserved plate.

506
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,126
You don't know. Jojo is very dangerous!

507
00:47:40,402 --> 00:47:45,186
What do you think? If he is dangerous,
Then Vicky is double dangerous!

508
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:49,088
- Isn't it Vicky?
- Yes, not double, triple dangerous!

509
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,105
Now I won't move from here.

510
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:53,633
Whether Jojo comes or bow wow!

511
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,257
Jojo has come.

512
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:11,840
- Come on baby, Dance! Come on baby.
- Please leave me.

513
00:49:06,674 --> 00:49:08,544
Please be seated.

514
00:49:24,953 --> 00:49:26,022
Sit.

515
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:29,030
Excuse me please.

516
00:49:33,297 --> 00:49:35,074
I think she didn't like your face.

517
00:49:37,122 --> 00:49:40,850
I've trapped him so that he
goes straight to the hospital!

518
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:41,787
Go away.

519
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:34,655
Swallowed the cap? Are you so hungry?

520
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,774
Whare is he?

521
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:20,289
I am finished! Sheetal.

522
00:51:27,247 --> 00:51:28,062
Let me go!

523
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:29,232
- Leave me!
- Shut up!

524
00:51:29,257 --> 00:51:31,518
Put me down. Help!

525
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:33,699
Help! Let me go!

526
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:37,090
I have just went to the loo
and you showed your colors!

527
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:39,670
I know she wanted to get me into trouble.

528
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:43,805
But that doesn't mean you carry
her off as if she belongs to you!

529
00:53:13,872 --> 00:53:15,794
The damage they have
suffered because of you

530
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:17,296
pay for it.

531
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:41,975
Now onwards when you laugh
people will laugh at you.

532
00:53:52,113 --> 00:53:55,053
I got the money for the damages.

533
00:53:55,361 --> 00:53:58,916
But in return Jojo's Dad
will damage you a lot.

534
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:01,757
That's what I want.

535
00:54:08,124 --> 00:54:09,431
Let's go meet him.

536
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,343
Listen...

537
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:22,285
Is it paining a lot?

538
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:23,231
Yes.

539
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:28,128
Here are 50 dollars for treatment.

540
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:29,380
Is it less!

541
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:36,588
These are the days of inflation.
Doesn't matter. Keep 500.

542
00:54:37,054 --> 00:54:38,375
Consult a good doctor.

543
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:42,445
I saved you from a gangster like
Jojo, risked my life for you!

544
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:47,832
I fought with his henchmen,
shed so much of my blood

545
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:51,432
and you are insulting me
instead of thanking me!

546
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:55,517
Deeds of a loafer and
talks like a soldier!

547
00:54:55,638 --> 00:54:58,810
- Yes.
- Look yourself in the mirror!

548
00:54:59,178 --> 00:55:01,292
Saying yourself Soldier! Let's go Sheetal.

549
00:55:01,346 --> 00:55:02,332
Oh no!

550
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:06,836
Don't forget to wipe the tomato sauce.

551
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:16,442
Very sour.

552
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:25,292
- Hello.
- Hello.

553
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:26,320
Who?

554
00:55:26,841 --> 00:55:30,280
The one who knows
everything about your heart.

555
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,913
You? How dare you call me!

556
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:37,259
With great difficulty I've
mustered courage for my finger.

557
00:55:37,653 --> 00:55:39,205
So that they could dial your number.

558
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:41,667
Don't disconnect without talking.

559
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:46,922
- Okay. Tell me what is it?
- I'm going to India forever.

560
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,097
That is why I want to meet
you for the last time.

561
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,503
- What? You're going back forever?
- Yes.

562
00:55:52,959 --> 00:55:53,947
Yes!

563
00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:56,951
So you want to meet me for the last time?

564
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:57,880
Yes.

565
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:00,508
All right. Okay. Come over.

566
00:56:01,373 --> 00:56:02,042
Okay.

567
00:56:03,855 --> 00:56:08,552
- What the blazes is this?
- There is very less time.

568
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,528
- Okay. Why do you want to meet me?
- I want to give you this card.

569
00:56:13,308 --> 00:56:14,793
- Card.
- I'm getting married.

570
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,133
Which poor girl is jacked?

571
00:56:17,262 --> 00:56:17,778
Here.

572
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,097
Are you going to marry her?

573
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:27,445
I won't do anything.
She'll do all that has to be done.

574
00:56:28,074 --> 00:56:29,920
But how did you agree to marry her?

575
00:56:31,226 --> 00:56:33,010
What can I do? I'm helpless.

576
00:56:33,678 --> 00:56:36,063
- What's the problem?
- Twist in story.

577
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:38,553
Shall I sit and tell you?

578
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:40,681
Okay.

579
00:56:41,658 --> 00:56:44,793
My dad and her dad were friends

580
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:47,613
and her granddad and
mine too were friends.

581
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:50,837
And her granddad made my
granddad promise on deathbed

582
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:55,196
they would marry us to continue
their friendship for 4 generations.

583
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,890
Tell me, what can I do?

584
00:56:57,198 --> 00:56:59,714
I can't put of my Dad,
this marriage can't be put off!

585
00:56:59,754 --> 00:57:01,510
This marriage is firm!

586
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:03,413
Oh I see.

587
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:04,783
Family problem.

588
00:57:05,653 --> 00:57:07,802
What can I do?

589
00:57:09,198 --> 00:57:12,633
- Give me a present.
- What preset?

590
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,904
Give me one of your sweet smiling evening.

591
00:57:16,856 --> 00:57:21,506
Which will spread light in
the darkness of my life.

592
00:57:23,268 --> 00:57:24,159
Will you meet me?

593
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:27,482
Okay.

594
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:32,716
A drunken man never lies.

595
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,136
Correct.

596
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,423
He can't lie.

597
00:57:36,789 --> 00:57:41,733
Your car banged into mine at the signal.

598
00:57:43,158 --> 00:57:48,746
It didn't crash. I banged it on purpose.

599
00:57:49,151 --> 00:57:51,400
What? Banged it on purpose?

600
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:54,557
What could I do?
Had to make friends with you.

601
00:57:55,143 --> 00:57:57,009
For that I had to meet you.

602
00:57:57,034 --> 00:57:59,440
I needed an excuse for it.

603
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,826
That's why...

604
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,153
And my tail light down.

605
00:58:04,725 --> 00:58:08,223
But this method of friendship was wrong.

606
00:58:08,565 --> 00:58:09,712
Correct.

607
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:15,253
And the method of giving money?

608
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,270
Absolutely wrong!

609
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,793
No experience of love.

610
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:23,832
Then it's all right.

611
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,359
I'll tell you something.

612
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:32,193
Tell me.

613
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:37,891
I goaded you into fighting Jojo
at Little India Restaurant.

614
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:41,224
Very bad.

615
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,840
No experience.

616
00:58:45,468 --> 00:58:46,353
Then okay.

617
00:58:47,245 --> 00:58:48,356
Please be seated.

618
00:58:50,232 --> 00:58:53,690
Did I say sorry for troubling you so much?

619
00:58:53,913 --> 00:58:58,504
- No. Did I say sorry?
- No.

620
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:01,938
Let's apologise to one another.

621
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:04,037
Sorry!

622
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:09,207
One minute. In your country
that's not how you say sorry.

623
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:11,213
How else?

624
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:12,685
Like this.

625
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,538
What are they doing?

626
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:20,762
Saying sorry to each other.

627
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:28,814
Good you told me.
I thought something else.

628
00:59:30,506 --> 00:59:34,593
Let's say sorry to each other.

629
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,113
Ready? One.

630
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,860
- Two.
- Three.

631
00:59:42,506 --> 00:59:43,490
Wait.

632
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:46,905
When two people say sorry to each other

633
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,676
why don't their noses clash?

634
00:59:50,193 --> 00:59:54,040
What a wrong time for the nose!

635
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,144
You don't know? Doesn't matter.

636
00:59:58,957 --> 01:00:00,498
Let's ask somebody.

637
01:00:01,686 --> 01:00:02,965
Brother!

638
01:00:06,738 --> 01:00:08,351
Brother! Tell us something.

639
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:12,640
When a girl and a boy
say sorry to each other

640
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,153
why don't their noses clash?

641
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:21,753
Say something.

642
01:00:23,276 --> 01:00:24,962
Sorry, I'm new to this place.

643
01:00:26,313 --> 01:00:27,873
The nose doesn't clash?

644
01:00:27,952 --> 01:00:33,026
No problem. We'll ask somebody clever.

645
01:00:36,506 --> 01:00:37,576
Where do you want to go?

646
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:42,506
We're not going anywhere.
Just want to ask one thing.

647
01:00:42,626 --> 01:00:46,144
- Ask as many questions.
- When a boy and a girl

648
01:00:46,168 --> 01:00:48,911
say sorry to each other,
why don't their noses clash?

649
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:05,546
What are you thinking of?

650
01:01:05,998 --> 01:01:07,776
We don't have all night.

651
01:01:08,028 --> 01:01:14,430
I'm not thinking of that.
It's been 20 years since my marriage

652
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:17,133
I never said sorry to my wife.

653
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,968
How will I know why
the nose doesn't clash?

654
01:01:20,381 --> 01:01:25,082
Both of you say sorry
to each other and see.

655
01:01:25,496 --> 01:01:27,768
You'll find out why
the nose doesn't clash.

656
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:34,202
I'll go home and say sorry to the
wife to see where the nose clashes!

657
01:01:34,496 --> 01:01:36,160
And the car goes there!

658
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:37,420
Thank you.

659
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,733
So clever.

660
01:01:42,152 --> 01:01:45,280
We'll say sorry and see.

661
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:46,301
Okay.

662
01:01:49,397 --> 01:01:52,120
Wait! How can you say sorry to me?

663
01:01:52,525 --> 01:01:55,631
- Why?
- Because sorry is only said to

664
01:01:55,871 --> 01:02:00,220
- the one you will marry.
- That's what I'm doing.

665
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:03,460
See the card if you don't believe.

666
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,407
'I love you, Preeti.'

667
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:19,477
Where is he?

668
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:27,057
'The one who has eyes only for you'

669
01:02:28,142 --> 01:02:30,097
'how can he marry another girl?'

670
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:35,920
'Yet if you don't accept my
love, tear this card and leave.'

671
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:38,845
'I'll go away from you forever.'

672
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:43,827
'If not, shut your eyes
and say in your heart'

673
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:45,513
'I love you.'

674
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,765
'I'll appear again.'

675
01:02:48,652 --> 01:02:49,436
'Loafer.'

676
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:52,322
Loafer.

677
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,312
Soldier.

678
01:02:56,216 --> 01:02:59,597
'And if not,
shut your eyes and say in your heart'

679
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:00,956
'I love you.'

680
01:03:01,806 --> 01:03:03,093
'I'll reappear.'

681
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,628
I love you.

682
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:56,371
"Having caught my gaze."

683
01:03:57,376 --> 01:04:01,536
"Having cast a spell."

684
01:04:02,115 --> 01:04:06,195
"Having given me a heart-ache."

685
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:11,002
"Having hovered around me."

686
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:16,186
"Soldier, Soldier, with your sweet words

687
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:20,424
you have stolen my heart".

688
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:25,808
"Soldier, Soldier, with your sweet words

689
01:04:26,146 --> 01:04:30,022
you have stolen my heart".

690
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:35,533
"Soldier, Soldier, with your sweet words

691
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:39,384
you have stolen my heart".

692
01:04:40,396 --> 01:04:44,566
"Having caught your gaze."

693
01:04:45,399 --> 01:04:49,006
"Having cast a spell."

694
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:54,091
"Having given you a heart-ache."

695
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:58,966
"Having hovered around you."

696
01:04:59,626 --> 01:05:04,275
"Soldier, Soldier, with his sweet words

697
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:08,131
has taken your heart away".

698
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:52,387
"My no, no, no... turned into yes."

699
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,876
"It's you...
who has come to mean the life to me."

700
01:05:57,143 --> 01:06:01,562
"Why oh why have I fallen in love?"

701
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:06,299
"That's the way you admit it."

702
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,906
"I swear it, you're a liar."

703
01:06:11,152 --> 01:06:15,092
"And you're the one, my love,
who has plundered my heart."

704
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:20,624
"Having caught my gaze."

705
01:06:21,525 --> 01:06:25,567
"Having cast a spell."

706
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,291
"Having given me a heart-ache."

707
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:35,010
"Having hovered around me."

708
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:40,388
"Soldier, Soldier, with your sweet words

709
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:44,722
you have stolen my heart".

710
01:07:28,815 --> 01:07:33,248
"Come, come to me."

711
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:37,804
"Go away...
don't awaken a thirst in my heart."

712
01:07:38,407 --> 01:07:42,858
"Do you really feel the ache?"

713
01:07:43,185 --> 01:07:47,065
"Yes, oh yes. I'm in a bad way."

714
01:07:47,265 --> 01:07:51,329
"You do know how to cast a spell."

715
01:07:52,028 --> 01:07:55,680
"But I'm hardly in control of myself."

716
01:07:57,614 --> 01:08:01,127
"Having caught your gaze."

717
01:08:02,437 --> 01:08:06,074
"Having cast a spell."

718
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,800
"Having given you a heart-ache."

719
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:15,819
"Having hovered around you."

720
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:21,391
"Soldier, Soldier, with his sweet words

721
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:25,102
has flown with your heart".

722
01:08:26,287 --> 01:08:30,885
"Soldier, Soldier, with your sweet words"

723
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:35,352
you have stolen my heart".

724
01:08:35,887 --> 01:08:40,682
"Soldier, Soldier, with your sweet words

725
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,339
I have stolen your heart".

726
01:09:28,807 --> 01:09:30,992
Preeti! Are you thinking what I am?

727
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:35,369
Let's go in and get married.

728
01:09:37,042 --> 01:09:39,449
You'll have to talk to my dad for this.

729
01:09:39,735 --> 01:09:42,622
I'll talk to him. Where is he?

730
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,162
Hello.

731
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:55,274
Hello my darling daughter. How are you?

732
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,752
Dad, I am very happy.

733
01:09:57,338 --> 01:09:59,805
I want you to meet somebody.

734
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:06,420
- The young man who is with you.
- Strange. How did you know?

735
01:10:06,509 --> 01:10:10,352
I even know what clothes he's wearing.

736
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:14,091
I keep track of you like any good dad.

737
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:18,112
Where you go,
with whom and who is meeting you.

738
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,617
But when are you coming?

739
01:10:20,992 --> 01:10:22,042
Today dad.

740
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,952
- I love you.
- I love you too.

741
01:10:28,972 --> 01:10:31,304
Come Pratap. Come. How are you?

742
01:10:32,677 --> 01:10:35,174
Absolutely fit. And you Baldev?

743
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:39,157
I'm fit if my brother is fit.

744
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:40,192
Come, come.

745
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:42,359
Why did you want to meet?

746
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:45,546
- Bad news.
- I know.

747
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,371
You want to say Jaswant is dead.

748
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:52,375
No, even worse.

749
01:10:53,195 --> 01:10:56,219
I've got reports that DK had him killed.

750
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,935
DK? Absolutely wrong.

751
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:04,147
Sir can never kill his
partner of 25 years!

752
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:06,757
DK can do anything for money.

753
01:11:07,065 --> 01:11:10,949
Even if he did, it's good.

754
01:11:11,303 --> 01:11:15,809
Had he escaped alive, the police
would've beaten everything out of him.

755
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:19,072
And handcuffed us and
taken us back to India!

756
01:11:20,273 --> 01:11:20,888
Here.

757
01:11:21,165 --> 01:11:22,611
Try to understand Viren.

758
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,758
Someday he might even finish us off.

759
01:11:25,895 --> 01:11:32,512
If he kills us who will supply
him American arms in India?

760
01:11:32,925 --> 01:11:36,697
Listen to me. Right from beginning
his intentions were not true.

761
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:39,217
That's why he never told us his address.

762
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:43,282
He can contact us anytime
but we can never reach him.

763
01:11:43,859 --> 01:11:46,516
What do you want? What should we do?

764
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:51,269
Before he attacks us,
we have to finish DK!

765
01:11:55,012 --> 01:11:56,677
The idea is not bad.

766
01:11:57,652 --> 01:12:01,687
We were 4 partners.
Jaswant died and three remain.

767
01:12:02,738 --> 01:12:04,859
We will kill DK and 2 will remain.

768
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:08,280
You kill me and only you are left.

769
01:12:09,389 --> 01:12:11,969
Do you think I'm a village idiot?

770
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:14,760
You want to grab the entire organization?

771
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:18,494
I find your intentions
dishonorable not DK's.

772
01:12:18,562 --> 01:12:22,245
- Shut up or...!
- Control yourself.

773
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:25,800
You'll be finding your fingers
if they touch the trigger.

774
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:31,125
I'm not Jaswant.
Firstly I won't die so easily.

775
01:12:31,943 --> 01:12:36,869
Even if I die, I won't become
a police file or news in paper.

776
01:12:37,477 --> 01:12:42,202
If you have a file on me,
I have a file of your deeds.

777
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:45,031
That file will go to the
police as soon as I die.

778
01:12:50,002 --> 01:12:53,557
What's the matter?
Changed your tune by seeing the gun?

779
01:12:54,405 --> 01:12:55,709
Laughing instead of crying.

780
01:12:58,193 --> 01:13:03,217
Hats off to you friend!
I was talking about killing DK

781
01:13:03,532 --> 01:13:08,819
because I wanted to know if you
had a hand in killing Jaswant.

782
01:13:09,783 --> 01:13:11,811
If you were responsible

783
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,205
you would agree with me.

784
01:13:16,005 --> 01:13:18,544
So what have you decided?

785
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:22,259
That you haven't changed.

786
01:13:22,895 --> 01:13:25,454
You're still a friend of friends.
As you were 20 years ago.

787
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:28,327
Nobody can divide us 3 partners.

788
01:13:29,114 --> 01:13:30,341
Except for death!

789
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:33,405
Yes. Except for death!

790
01:13:35,505 --> 01:13:39,007
Do you see that island?
Dad bought it for my last birthday.

791
01:13:39,686 --> 01:13:42,817
And that island?
That was on my first birthday.

792
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:43,582
Really?

793
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:47,024
So your dad buys you a new
island for every birthday?

794
01:13:47,212 --> 01:13:48,882
Yes, and that to in my name.

795
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,974
Don't tell this to anybody else.

796
01:13:51,645 --> 01:13:54,104
- Why?
- It will let out your age.

797
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:55,312
You!

798
01:13:59,625 --> 01:14:02,594
Look there. That's my dad.

799
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:07,178
Hi.

800
01:14:11,775 --> 01:14:14,325
- Come my darling come, come, come.
- Hi Dad.

801
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:16,597
- This is...
- Vicky.

802
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:17,827
Wow!

803
01:14:18,389 --> 01:14:20,400
You know his name without telling you?

804
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:23,207
When he knows the color of
my clothes from miles away

805
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:27,221
- he can know my name too.
- While giving a daughter

806
01:14:27,532 --> 01:14:29,992
work is seen in addition to name.

807
01:14:30,495 --> 01:14:33,360
- Whatever he does, is great!
- Really?

808
01:14:33,717 --> 01:14:38,872
We'll see. You go in,
we have to talk about business.

809
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:40,499
Okay.

810
01:14:47,932 --> 01:14:48,847
Tell me, Vicky.

811
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:55,180
First tell me who gave you
the contract to kill Jaswant?

812
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:58,483
So you know about my work?

813
01:14:59,872 --> 01:15:03,427
Anyway hear my principles too.

814
01:15:04,177 --> 01:15:07,664
I see the cash while accepting a
contract, not the payer.

815
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:13,807
You haven't seen the man who gave
you a contract to love my daughter?

816
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:19,994
Pratap Sir! I accept contracts for
killing not to play game of love!

817
01:15:20,722 --> 01:15:22,654
Preeti's love and mine is not a game.

818
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:27,840
Maybe but a dad won't
give his daughter to a man

819
01:15:28,342 --> 01:15:29,857
whose hands are tainted with blood.

820
01:15:30,501 --> 01:15:33,690
If mine are tainted,
are yours milky white?

821
01:15:35,246 --> 01:15:37,086
Even I know about you.

822
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:39,652
We belong to the same community.

823
01:15:41,354 --> 01:15:43,462
Community but not position.

824
01:15:44,437 --> 01:15:48,584
You are a paid ass in this
business Whereas I'm a lion!

825
01:15:49,477 --> 01:15:51,750
You've reached here because
you came with my child.

826
01:15:52,491 --> 01:15:57,000
Otherwise my security dogs wouldn't
have let your bones come near me.

827
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:01,762
For the first time,
I've seen dogs guarding a lion!

828
01:16:03,623 --> 01:16:04,777
Just Listen to 2 things
that I have to say.

829
01:16:05,555 --> 01:16:09,089
In today's world,
lions can be safe in only 2 places.

830
01:16:09,578 --> 01:16:12,171
In the circus and in the zoo!

831
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:15,609
Secondly, regarding position.

832
01:16:16,704 --> 01:16:21,014
I can take you to that place

833
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,770
that you're dreaming of for 20 years.

834
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:26,354
But can never reach it.

835
01:16:28,544 --> 01:16:29,085
Means?

836
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:09,829
Hello.

837
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:15,123
Saw what I broke in place
of two teeth of mine?

838
01:17:17,937 --> 01:17:19,301
Pomeranian Puppy!

839
01:17:20,629 --> 01:17:22,358
Give the line to your Pop, the bulldog.

840
01:17:23,047 --> 01:17:23,641
Dad.

841
01:17:23,921 --> 01:17:26,136
- What is it?
- He called me a puppy!

842
01:17:26,536 --> 01:17:27,417
And me?

843
01:17:28,234 --> 01:17:28,973
Bulldog.

844
01:17:29,217 --> 01:17:31,594
He called me a bulldog? Give me the phone!

845
01:17:32,306 --> 01:17:34,339
Are we a family of dogs?

846
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:38,472
I didn't find you or
I'd have broken you too!

847
01:17:38,712 --> 01:17:41,246
You won't believe, I'm very bad!

848
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:43,909
When you will meet me,
You will become nervous.

849
01:17:44,074 --> 01:17:46,077
We're a family of tigers not dogs!

850
01:17:46,257 --> 01:17:48,672
We bite not bark!

851
01:17:48,784 --> 01:17:50,344
We eat raw people!

852
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:51,611
Are you frightened?

853
01:17:51,942 --> 01:17:53,584
Why aren't you speaking? Hello?

854
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,125
Can you hear?

855
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:58,201
I'm talking to you not myself!

856
01:17:59,195 --> 01:18:04,549
I've been yelling for ages! I'm not mad!

857
01:18:04,984 --> 01:18:06,289
Total 8500.

858
01:18:06,574 --> 01:18:08,869
- Plus 100% tax.
- What?

859
01:18:11,801 --> 01:18:15,312
Total 17000. Round figure 20000.

860
01:18:15,634 --> 01:18:18,086
Which figure are you
rounding and squaring?

861
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:21,672
This is the damage your
son did to my house.

862
01:18:21,807 --> 01:18:24,611
- You'll take money from me?
- Not rupees, in dollars.

863
01:18:25,447 --> 01:18:29,786
My bill will reach you at 3.55

864
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:32,285
I'll come at 4 to take the cash.

865
01:18:32,814 --> 01:18:34,866
And leave at 4.05.

866
01:18:36,303 --> 01:18:38,978
10 minutes for giving and taking.

867
01:18:39,913 --> 01:18:43,122
Take those 10 minutes seriously. Got it?

868
01:18:45,117 --> 01:18:47,637
- What happened?
- Nothing, he talks rot!

869
01:18:47,967 --> 01:18:50,179
Says he'll send the bill at 3.55

870
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:53,989
and will leave at 4:05.
As if we're here to pay cash!

871
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:55,032
Are we donkeys?

872
01:18:55,992 --> 01:19:00,266
The arms buyers would have come,
bring them in. Let me do some work.

873
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:03,131
Gentlemen.

874
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:05,038
We have machine guns.

875
01:19:05,284 --> 01:19:09,566
Mouser.. AK-47, AK-56, AK-98

876
01:19:09,949 --> 01:19:14,584
even those not yet in the market.
We have 2 lakh pieces of each.

877
01:19:14,906 --> 01:19:16,901
We'll send you the guns you need.

878
01:19:18,224 --> 01:19:18,723
Next.

879
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:22,879
This is a pipe gun.

880
01:19:23,164 --> 01:19:24,385
This pipe gun blast people.

881
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:28,564
With every pipe gun,
you get a dozen Hamam soaps free.

882
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,109
Oh Hamam?

883
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,336
Now show them our bomb section.

884
01:19:40,876 --> 01:19:42,766
Wow! Good idea to display bomb.

885
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:44,588
You have displayed bomb nicely.

886
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:45,256
Thank you.

887
01:19:47,813 --> 01:19:48,848
- Dad.
- Yes.

888
01:19:49,101 --> 01:19:50,599
- 3:55.
- 3:55?

889
01:19:53,835 --> 01:19:55,830
This is real bomb.

890
01:19:55,854 --> 01:19:58,186
- Run.
- Run.

891
01:20:15,999 --> 01:20:18,046
Dad! It's the phone ringing dad.

892
01:20:22,202 --> 01:20:22,755
Hello.

893
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,399
Don't be scared. It's the bill not a bomb.

894
01:20:35,596 --> 01:20:38,004
What do you think? I got scared?

895
01:20:38,498 --> 01:20:40,750
I play with such bombs day and night.

896
01:20:40,996 --> 01:20:43,344
I deal with them. Where are you?

897
01:20:46,691 --> 01:20:48,750
- John!
- John!

898
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:51,084
- What happened dad?
- He's come downstairs.

899
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:55,118
Tell him I'm taking the lift up.

900
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:56,776
He is coming by lift.

901
01:20:57,074 --> 01:20:58,250
- What?
- Yes sir.

902
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:28,211
Stop! Stop firing! Stop firing!

903
01:21:30,618 --> 01:21:31,033
John!

904
01:21:56,962 --> 01:21:58,904
Dad! Dad!

905
01:23:16,088 --> 01:23:17,898
Well done.

906
01:23:19,146 --> 01:23:20,422
You did very well!

907
01:23:21,419 --> 01:23:23,091
I thought you were good for nothing.

908
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,324
But you proved to be very smart!

909
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:30,187
You deserve all the praise!

910
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:34,259
And you called me a bulldog!

911
01:23:35,497 --> 01:23:39,284
Whether a dog bites or
licks, both are dangerous!

912
01:23:44,114 --> 01:23:45,299
His pistol is empty.

913
01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:57,690
Dad!

914
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:02,189
Don't move or else the bullet
will go off in your ear.

915
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:04,237
But it will bleed from some other place.

916
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:05,917
Cash.

917
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:40,170
Sir nobody is here.

918
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:48,434
Pomeranian puppy!

919
01:25:01,081 --> 01:25:03,547
No, no, no. You please send
money within half an hour.

920
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,344
Baldev! It's a very big deal.

921
01:25:06,525 --> 01:25:08,208
- Call George.
- He's in hospital.

922
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:11,512
- Then call Kalia or Rahim.
- They both are also in the hospital.

923
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:13,874
Is the gorilla also in the hospital?

924
01:25:13,951 --> 01:25:15,704
Unfortunately he is also in the hospital.

925
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:17,619
What they are doing in the hospital?

926
01:25:17,756 --> 01:25:19,650
Have they gone to get a corpse
or have they all got aids?

927
01:25:19,802 --> 01:25:22,823
You know uncle.
This is all because of that Indian.

928
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:26,205
First he burnt my teeth
then he bashed up my men.

929
01:25:26,504 --> 01:25:29,280
And on top of that he called
me a Pomeranian puppy and him.

930
01:25:29,601 --> 01:25:30,255
Bull dog.

931
01:25:30,923 --> 01:25:32,699
Then he did a miracle!

932
01:25:32,723 --> 01:25:35,189
- What?
- He thrashed Dad.

933
01:25:35,504 --> 01:25:38,337
He took money from him for all
the damage I did to his house.

934
01:25:40,372 --> 01:25:46,245
Rascal! Recounting the tale of his
bashing as if he's won a medal!

935
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,404
He's not an ordinary boy.

936
01:25:48,428 --> 01:25:52,867
Then is he a King Kong?
If the tale of my shame spreads

937
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,892
I won't have the face to return to Patna!

938
01:25:55,388 --> 01:25:57,322
Go and take my marksman with you.

939
01:25:57,545 --> 01:25:59,234
What do we say.. Yes, sharp shooter.

940
01:25:59,548 --> 01:26:04,837
Go, shoot him! If you come without
shooting him, I'll shoot all of you!

941
01:26:38,196 --> 01:26:39,824
The rascal's mother is coming.

942
01:26:41,701 --> 01:26:44,529
He will go to the airport to receive her.

943
01:27:18,178 --> 01:27:19,147
I'll kill him.

944
01:27:19,356 --> 01:27:21,189
- Give me the gun.
- Okay.

945
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:29,063
Jojo Shoot.

946
01:27:33,585 --> 01:27:34,327
Shoot him Jojo!

947
01:27:38,054 --> 01:27:39,157
He went behind.

948
01:27:40,836 --> 01:27:41,527
Now!

949
01:27:46,883 --> 01:27:48,735
- Shit!
- Where's that rascal come from?

950
01:27:51,588 --> 01:27:53,514
- Mother has come.
- Now kill him Jojo!

951
01:27:57,591 --> 01:27:58,477
Shoot Jojo!

952
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:06,104
Sister-in-law?

953
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:10,544
- Stop!
- What's wrong?

954
01:28:10,905 --> 01:28:12,780
This is my sister-in-law!

955
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:18,765
That means this is my elder brother's son!

956
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,149
This is our own blood!

957
01:28:21,855 --> 01:28:26,640
If brother hears this good news,
he will give all his property of Patna.

958
01:28:42,487 --> 01:28:44,663
Uncle will be happy to hear it!

959
01:28:48,335 --> 01:28:48,974
Shanti.

960
01:28:50,063 --> 01:28:51,814
- In Australia?
- Yes!

961
01:28:51,975 --> 01:28:53,092
I am telling the truth.

962
01:28:53,258 --> 01:28:57,412
The boy we went to kill is
actually your son Vicky!

963
01:28:57,691 --> 01:29:00,187
My son! My Shanti!

964
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,245
I can't believe it Baldev!
Are you telling the truth?

965
01:29:04,269 --> 01:29:07,020
Yes. Brother,
Jojo you tell him what you have seen.

966
01:29:07,129 --> 01:29:11,992
Dad is right. We ourselves saw
brother Vicky touching her feet.

967
01:29:14,684 --> 01:29:17,663
My son! Shanti!

968
01:29:21,563 --> 01:29:22,844
You've come to the wrong address.

969
01:29:23,777 --> 01:29:26,775
Vicky's mother stays here not your wife.

970
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:31,597
Think why fate has brought us
together in a foreign land?

971
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:33,973
Just, so that we can live together.

972
01:29:34,883 --> 01:29:38,227
A child who pretends to be
an orphan will get his dad.

973
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:42,855
Orphans are those kids who
have neither dad nor mother.

974
01:29:44,535 --> 01:29:46,229
And Vicky's mother is alive.

975
01:29:46,408 --> 01:29:52,012
Don't be adamant. Today I have so
much wealth I can buy anything.

976
01:29:52,523 --> 01:29:56,092
Then go and buy yourself a wife and a son.

977
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:01,132
People who sell themselves for
money don't live in this house.

978
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:05,775
Please forget everything.
I apologize on brother's behalf.

979
01:30:08,108 --> 01:30:11,069
The man who sells his motherland

980
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:14,100
who is responsible for
the death of innocents

981
01:30:15,135 --> 01:30:18,375
they deserve punishment not forgiveness.

982
01:30:19,927 --> 01:30:21,052
You all may leave.

983
01:30:21,645 --> 01:30:22,192
Shanti.

984
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,546
Shanti, Listen to me.

985
01:30:26,917 --> 01:30:29,587
Brother, this is your son!

986
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,207
Vicky.

987
01:30:37,995 --> 01:30:41,152
- Son, You don't know me, son...
- I know.

988
01:30:42,518 --> 01:30:43,632
I have heard everything.

989
01:30:44,512 --> 01:30:48,674
Son! My son!

990
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:50,710
Don't be angry with me.

991
01:30:51,787 --> 01:30:53,867
I'm pining for you since 20 years!

992
01:30:54,428 --> 01:30:57,450
Even I've been pining
for my dad for 20 years!

993
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,807
Blood is thicker than water.

994
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:05,164
Yes, uncle. Blood is after all blood.

995
01:31:06,233 --> 01:31:11,010
- Now if Shanti agrees...
- Leave her to me.

996
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:12,434
I'll convince her.

997
01:31:13,382 --> 01:31:17,189
Organize a great party now!

998
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:21,480
I'll announce to the world
that I'm not childless!

999
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:26,280
His son who will work with him
shoulder to shoulder has come!

1000
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:31,374
Welcome, welcome. This is my son Vicky.

1001
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:32,459
- Mr. Marshall.
- Hello.

1002
01:31:32,503 --> 01:31:33,968
Please sit down. Enjoy yourself.

1003
01:31:35,037 --> 01:31:38,430
Singhania sir, Come. Come.

1004
01:31:52,485 --> 01:31:54,050
- You?
- Yes me?

1005
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:55,792
- You have a brother?
- Yes.

1006
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:57,211
- Twin brother?
- Yes.

1007
01:31:57,532 --> 01:31:59,212
- Who was lost in the kumbh fair?
- Yes.

1008
01:31:59,378 --> 01:32:02,729
- He's come to look for you from India!
- Where is he?

1009
01:32:02,753 --> 01:32:06,086
- He becomes a policeman, waiter...
- And sometimes band master!

1010
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:08,318
You always find me only!

1011
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,837
I'm Mohan!

1012
01:32:11,704 --> 01:32:14,616
I thought my brother would
have become a smuggler.

1013
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:17,077
They keep doing parties here.

1014
01:32:17,505 --> 01:32:19,800
Someday I'll find him singing and dancing.

1015
01:32:20,138 --> 01:32:23,685
Lord! Why did you make kumbh fair?

1016
01:32:23,714 --> 01:32:25,514
- Hey play man!
- Yeah.

1017
01:32:28,374 --> 01:32:29,295
Enjoy yourself.

1018
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:33,737
Come Pratap! Come! Come!

1019
01:32:33,878 --> 01:32:35,175
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

1020
01:32:35,212 --> 01:32:36,219
Hello Viren!

1021
01:32:36,389 --> 01:32:38,573
- How are you Baldev?
- I am fine.

1022
01:32:38,763 --> 01:32:39,840
She's my daughter. Preeti.

1023
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:41,332
- Hello uncle.
- Hello.

1024
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:44,663
You've grown so big! Where do you live?

1025
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:48,434
- I haven't seen you for ages.
- I stay separately as I'm studying.

1026
01:32:48,892 --> 01:32:52,792
Congrats for finding your
wife and son after 20 years!

1027
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,771
- Where are they?
- My wife hasn't come.

1028
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:57,892
I'll introduce you to my son.

1029
01:32:59,053 --> 01:33:01,050
Come here son.

1030
01:33:07,233 --> 01:33:08,055
Excuse me.

1031
01:33:10,118 --> 01:33:11,130
Is this your son?

1032
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,765
Yes. You got shocked?

1033
01:33:15,863 --> 01:33:19,423
And why not? Till yesterday
Pratap was our equal every way.

1034
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:24,480
But after son's arrival our
strength has grown 4 times!

1035
01:33:24,584 --> 01:33:27,587
No uncle! The enemy gets startled.

1036
01:33:27,897 --> 01:33:31,882
Not our friends.
And Pratap sir is our friend not enemy.

1037
01:33:40,178 --> 01:33:42,280
Thank you. Congratulations.

1038
01:33:42,532 --> 01:33:46,634
In India, elders give
blessings not congratulations.

1039
01:33:48,308 --> 01:33:50,467
Do you know each other?

1040
01:33:50,818 --> 01:33:54,592
Viren! Now it's your turn to get startled.

1041
01:33:54,975 --> 01:33:59,407
He's your son later.
First he has become my to-be son-in-law!

1042
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:00,230
Means?

1043
01:34:00,563 --> 01:34:04,695
Means your son and my
daughter are in love.

1044
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:07,357
- What?
- Yes, uncle.

1045
01:34:07,595 --> 01:34:10,514
For her, Vicky brother burnt my teeth.

1046
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:14,400
So my son hasn't come alone!

1047
01:34:14,678 --> 01:34:18,224
He's brought his bride along!
Baldev! What are you looking at?

1048
01:34:18,412 --> 01:34:19,658
Open up champagne immediately!

1049
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:21,554
It's a double occasion!

1050
01:34:54,413 --> 01:34:58,505
"She's the one my eyes were...
at the gathering."

1051
01:34:58,609 --> 01:35:03,257
"She's the one my eyes were...
at the gathering."

1052
01:35:04,012 --> 01:35:07,790
"I did my best but they
were still drawn to her."

1053
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:09,787
"What am I suppose to do?"

1054
01:35:10,256 --> 01:35:12,317
"What a heart will do?"

1055
01:35:12,510 --> 01:35:14,632
"Oh, what am I suppose to do?"

1056
01:35:19,777 --> 01:35:23,834
"He's the one my eyes
were at the gathering."

1057
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:28,810
"He's the one my eyes
were at the gathering."

1058
01:35:29,303 --> 01:35:33,049
"I did my best but they
were still drawn to him."

1059
01:35:33,412 --> 01:35:37,559
"What am I suppose to do?
What a heart will do?"

1060
01:35:37,852 --> 01:35:39,989
"What am I suppose to do?"

1061
01:36:13,164 --> 01:36:18,642
"This season has arrived my love"

1062
01:36:22,269 --> 01:36:27,886
"my heart is immersed in your memories."

1063
01:36:31,486 --> 01:36:36,233
"Neither is it my fault,
nor is it your mistake"

1064
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:45,360
"yours is the intoxication
that has left me in a daze."

1065
01:36:56,745 --> 01:37:00,713
"Face to face with you,
my heart has skipped a beat."

1066
01:37:00,818 --> 01:37:05,512
"Face to face with you,
my heart has skipped a beat."

1067
01:37:06,234 --> 01:37:10,021
"I did my best to avoid her gaze
but they were still drawn to her."

1068
01:37:10,269 --> 01:37:14,483
"What am I suppose to do?
What my heart will do?"

1069
01:37:14,770 --> 01:37:16,948
"Oh, what am I suppose to do?"

1070
01:37:40,749 --> 01:37:45,156
"Soldier, soldier, with your sweet words"

1071
01:37:45,436 --> 01:37:49,043
"you've stolen my heart."

1072
01:37:49,951 --> 01:37:54,361
"Soldier, soldier, with sweet words"

1073
01:37:54,706 --> 01:37:58,518
"he has stolen your words."

1074
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:09,376
"My loneliness feels
there's nothing to express."

1075
01:38:12,998 --> 01:38:17,983
"In your arms, want to sleep in your
eyes, want to live."

1076
01:38:22,216 --> 01:38:27,743
"Your breath and my breath
are now tied together."

1077
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:36,213
"This is a bond that will not
be broken by the world's might."

1078
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:51,492
"In your arms, I lie shattered."

1079
01:38:52,029 --> 01:38:56,483
"In your arms, I lie shattered"

1080
01:38:56,904 --> 01:39:00,715
"you've saved me, yet I'm broken."

1081
01:39:00,984 --> 01:39:05,265
"What am I suppose to do?
What will heart do?"

1082
01:39:05,461 --> 01:39:07,643
"What am I suppose to do?"

1083
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:12,323
"She's the one my eyes
were at the gathering."

1084
01:39:12,549 --> 01:39:17,211
"He's the one my eyes
were at the gathering."

1085
01:39:17,656 --> 01:39:21,551
"I did my best to but they
were still drawn to her"

1086
01:39:21,684 --> 01:39:26,048
- "What am I suppose to do?
- What will heart do?"

1087
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:28,553
"What am I suppose to do?"

1088
01:39:32,249 --> 01:39:33,760
Where are we going, Dad?

1089
01:39:34,831 --> 01:39:37,643
You are my heir so it's essential for you

1090
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:40,590
to know what I've earned in my life.

1091
01:39:41,828 --> 01:39:43,501
And where I've hidden it. Come.

1092
01:39:49,509 --> 01:39:51,869
This path leads to that
secret place of mine...

1093
01:39:51,893 --> 01:39:55,643
That nobody including my brother
Baldev knows nothing about it.

1094
01:39:56,475 --> 01:40:00,241
I've brought you here so that I can
tell you the secrets of my business.

1095
01:40:00,759 --> 01:40:03,361
Finally you have to take over. Come.

1096
01:40:05,818 --> 01:40:06,916
Come my son. Come.

1097
01:40:10,586 --> 01:40:12,934
I'm very happy today. Very happy.

1098
01:40:14,599 --> 01:40:17,651
In one day you have
fulfilled my dreams of years!

1099
01:40:18,056 --> 01:40:20,621
A dad's dream is to get his son married.

1100
01:40:20,832 --> 01:40:26,128
Not for that but because you
trapped that rascal's girl

1101
01:40:26,495 --> 01:40:28,918
and brought him to my feet!

1102
01:40:29,682 --> 01:40:32,389
What are you saying?
Pratap is your friend.

1103
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:37,609
What friend? If he gets the
chance, he'll gobble up his friend!

1104
01:40:37,954 --> 01:40:41,718
But I'm no less.
You must have heard the magician's story?

1105
01:40:41,989 --> 01:40:43,752
His life was in a parrot.

1106
01:40:44,123 --> 01:40:47,636
Pratap's life is in my hands.

1107
01:40:48,266 --> 01:40:51,611
- I didn't get it.
- That's why I brought you here.

1108
01:40:51,964 --> 01:40:53,149
Wait.

1109
01:40:59,959 --> 01:41:04,909
This is that parrot in which
the proof of Pratap's evil deeds

1110
01:41:05,344 --> 01:41:07,316
is written with dates.

1111
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:08,471
Look.

1112
01:41:10,069 --> 01:41:12,198
This is our third partner Jaswant.

1113
01:41:12,612 --> 01:41:17,126
He is no more.
And this is our fourth partner, D. K.

1114
01:41:17,936 --> 01:41:19,116
He stays in India.

1115
01:41:23,036 --> 01:41:26,704
You are right.
Pratap's life is really in your hands.

1116
01:41:27,296 --> 01:41:31,496
But the problem is that
my life is in his hands.

1117
01:41:32,216 --> 01:41:34,736
Pratap has a similar file of mine.

1118
01:41:36,012 --> 01:41:39,042
That is why I've agreed to
have relations with him.

1119
01:41:39,821 --> 01:41:44,730
So that as his son-in-law
you can get my file from him.

1120
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:50,661
Then you'll see how I will
give him a rat's death!

1121
01:41:51,841 --> 01:41:55,470
And then I'll put all my
burden on your shoulders.

1122
01:41:56,469 --> 01:41:57,818
I'll sleep in peace.

1123
01:41:58,643 --> 01:42:01,568
What's the use of that son who
can't put his dad into sleep?

1124
01:44:35,176 --> 01:44:36,068
He is DK?

1125
01:44:56,806 --> 01:44:58,466
Find out who owns the ship?

1126
01:45:06,451 --> 01:45:08,798
- Good morning, uncle.
- Good morning.

1127
01:45:09,959 --> 01:45:12,758
- Good morning Jojo.
- Good morning big brother.

1128
01:45:16,359 --> 01:45:17,265
- Uncle.
- Yes.

1129
01:45:17,431 --> 01:45:18,553
I haven't seen Dad since yesterday.

1130
01:45:18,629 --> 01:45:23,243
You won't believe the calls
that have come since morning.

1131
01:45:23,572 --> 01:45:28,298
So many inquiries.
But they will speak only if they know.

1132
01:45:36,701 --> 01:45:37,395
Hello.

1133
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:40,922
Vicky.

1134
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:43,693
What are you saying?

1135
01:45:45,976 --> 01:45:46,846
Yes, he's here.

1136
01:45:49,898 --> 01:45:50,701
Where will he go?

1137
01:45:51,938 --> 01:45:54,060
Come here.

1138
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,018
Now you can't escape!

1139
01:46:00,825 --> 01:46:02,235
Your secret is out!

1140
01:46:02,835 --> 01:46:06,098
- What secret?
- Hear it yourself.

1141
01:46:10,023 --> 01:46:12,108
- Hello.
- Hello.

1142
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:14,437
It's you?

1143
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:18,051
You got scared! Right?

1144
01:46:19,531 --> 01:46:21,491
Do you remember it's a
girl's birthday today?

1145
01:46:21,736 --> 01:46:25,238
- No. Which girl?
- One innocent girl.

1146
01:46:25,763 --> 01:46:28,478
Who is trapped in a foolish,
absent minded boy's love.

1147
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:32,078
If he's absent minded he
will obviously forget.

1148
01:46:33,218 --> 01:46:35,963
The girl should have thought
of this before falling in love.

1149
01:46:36,049 --> 01:46:38,318
She had no experience of love.

1150
01:46:38,605 --> 01:46:41,969
That's how she made a mistake.
Now what is she to do?

1151
01:46:42,274 --> 01:46:44,229
She must trust the boy.

1152
01:46:45,004 --> 01:46:47,458
I'll catch that fool and bring him.

1153
01:46:47,535 --> 01:46:50,378
How will that foolish
boy recognize that girl?

1154
01:46:50,528 --> 01:46:54,736
That won't be necessary.
That boy is so special

1155
01:46:55,298 --> 01:46:58,208
that the girl will come running to him.

1156
01:46:58,748 --> 01:47:01,920
It's also possible that the
boy will keep watching it.

1157
01:47:02,424 --> 01:47:04,313
And the girl goes away with another!

1158
01:47:05,116 --> 01:47:07,455
Fine, so let's see.

1159
01:47:19,615 --> 01:47:20,571
Hi.

1160
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,136
Looks like somebody's heart is burning.

1161
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:41,416
"She has sashayed through
my heart and my soul"

1162
01:47:43,456 --> 01:47:45,840
"a girl has just passed
through this pass."

1163
01:47:47,858 --> 01:47:50,731
"She has sashayed through
my heart and my soul"

1164
01:47:52,456 --> 01:47:54,859
"a girl has just passed
through this pass."

1165
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:58,743
"Fair cheeks."

1166
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:01,195
"Dark hair."

1167
01:48:01,719 --> 01:48:02,844
"Fair cheeks."

1168
01:48:02,869 --> 01:48:04,011
"Dark hair."

1169
01:48:04,036 --> 01:48:05,122
"Swaggering gait"

1170
01:48:05,163 --> 01:48:07,633
"she's 16... she's driven me crazy."

1171
01:48:07,868 --> 01:48:10,036
"Lord Almighty!"

1172
01:48:10,144 --> 01:48:12,253
"Lord Almighty!"

1173
01:48:12,384 --> 01:48:14,568
"Lord Almighty!"

1174
01:48:14,641 --> 01:48:16,995
"Lord Almighty!"

1175
01:48:22,632 --> 01:48:23,834
Looks like there's a fire somewhere.

1176
01:48:24,848 --> 01:48:25,628
Should I call the fire brigade?

1177
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:29,914
"He has sashayed through
my heart and my soul"

1178
01:48:31,733 --> 01:48:34,418
"a boy has just passed through this pass."

1179
01:48:36,429 --> 01:48:37,921
"Straight and simple."

1180
01:48:38,686 --> 01:48:40,366
"He torments."

1181
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:43,254
"Straight and simple. He torments."

1182
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:45,559
"He keeps me awake, appears in my dreams"

1183
01:48:45,584 --> 01:48:46,950
"he's driven me crazy."

1184
01:48:47,162 --> 01:48:49,234
"Lord Almighty!"

1185
01:48:49,388 --> 01:48:51,476
"Lord Almighty!"

1186
01:48:51,615 --> 01:48:53,843
"Lord Almighty!"

1187
01:48:53,885 --> 01:48:56,235
"Lord Almighty!"

1188
01:49:19,459 --> 01:49:23,658
"Oh, your eyes"

1189
01:49:23,986 --> 01:49:27,630
"they're so piercing,
although you wear no kohl."

1190
01:49:28,463 --> 01:49:32,558
"Oh, your sweet talk"

1191
01:49:33,016 --> 01:49:36,623
"how I love it."

1192
01:49:37,029 --> 01:49:42,028
"Your charms have robbed me of my peace."

1193
01:49:42,384 --> 01:49:46,448
"You're the only one my eyes dream of."

1194
01:49:46,879 --> 01:49:51,121
"You've just arrived.
Wait... don't go away."

1195
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:57,008
"Someone might spot us...
don't tease me like this."

1196
01:49:57,594 --> 01:50:00,390
"She's escaped my eye."

1197
01:50:02,112 --> 01:50:04,816
"A girl has just passed by."

1198
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:08,776
"Fair cheeks."

1199
01:50:09,116 --> 01:50:10,861
"Dark hair."

1200
01:50:11,349 --> 01:50:13,559
"Fair cheeks. Dark hair."

1201
01:50:13,598 --> 01:50:14,746
"Swaggering gait"

1202
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:17,333
"she's 16... she's driven me crazy."

1203
01:50:17,514 --> 01:50:19,726
"Lord Almighty!"

1204
01:50:19,824 --> 01:50:21,931
"Lord Almighty!"

1205
01:50:22,029 --> 01:50:24,181
"Lord Almighty!"

1206
01:50:24,309 --> 01:50:26,768
"Lord Almighty!"

1207
01:50:36,309 --> 01:50:40,013
"You've promised to meet me tomorrow"

1208
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:44,385
"make sure you don't forget it."

1209
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:49,646
"Even if I forget it,"

1210
01:50:49,914 --> 01:50:53,513
"you can remind me."

1211
01:50:54,428 --> 01:50:58,583
"Life is but short-lived."

1212
01:50:58,629 --> 01:51:03,453
"All day and night, my heart seeks you."

1213
01:51:03,722 --> 01:51:08,145
"My thirst has awakened, how I pine."

1214
01:51:08,274 --> 01:51:12,555
"You are the one I
desire, it's you I want."

1215
01:51:14,483 --> 01:51:17,221
"He has sashayed through
my heart and my soul"

1216
01:51:18,946 --> 01:51:21,825
"a boy has just passed through this pass."

1217
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:25,351
"Straight and simple."

1218
01:51:25,965 --> 01:51:27,479
"He torments."

1219
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:30,530
"Straight and simple. He torments."

1220
01:51:30,555 --> 01:51:32,840
"He keeps me awake, appears in my dreams"

1221
01:51:32,865 --> 01:51:34,291
"he's driven me crazy."

1222
01:51:34,418 --> 01:51:36,563
"Lord Almighty!"

1223
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,809
"Lord Almighty!"

1224
01:51:38,887 --> 01:51:41,084
"Lord Almighty!"

1225
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:43,621
"Lord Almighty!"

1226
01:51:43,741 --> 01:51:47,073
"She has sashayed through
my heart and my soul"

1227
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:50,768
"a girl has just passed
through this pass."

1228
01:51:53,017 --> 01:51:54,755
"Fair cheeks."

1229
01:51:55,344 --> 01:51:57,061
"Dark hair."

1230
01:51:57,624 --> 01:51:59,888
"Fair cheeks. Dark hair."

1231
01:51:59,913 --> 01:52:01,004
"Swaggering gait"

1232
01:52:01,029 --> 01:52:03,675
"she's 16... she's driven me crazy."

1233
01:52:03,788 --> 01:52:08,216
"Lord Almighty!"

1234
01:52:08,295 --> 01:52:13,279
"Lord Almighty!"

1235
01:52:23,483 --> 01:52:26,213
God! What have you done?

1236
01:52:26,401 --> 01:52:28,803
Taken my brother away!

1237
01:52:28,972 --> 01:52:31,793
- We have became orphan.
- What's he is saying?

1238
01:52:32,064 --> 01:52:33,417
He is crying for uncle.

1239
01:52:33,991 --> 01:52:38,161
Uncle, why are you crying?
Why are the police here?

1240
01:52:39,766 --> 01:52:44,738
You won't believe this son.
Somebody killed your dad!

1241
01:52:44,762 --> 01:52:48,286
- What?
- Killed him and fed the body to sharks.

1242
01:52:48,541 --> 01:52:52,013
If he could fed to dogs,
we could have found his bones!

1243
01:52:52,185 --> 01:52:55,683
- To cremate him.
- Now how will we do the rites?

1244
01:52:55,707 --> 01:52:56,446
- Vicky.
- Excuse me.

1245
01:52:57,879 --> 01:52:59,871
This cigarette lighter was
found at the murder site.

1246
01:53:00,139 --> 01:53:01,096
Do any of you recognize it?

1247
01:53:01,248 --> 01:53:03,886
I can't understand what he's saying.

1248
01:53:03,946 --> 01:53:07,141
He's asking whose lighter is this.

1249
01:53:07,824 --> 01:53:11,333
I don't know. My brother never...

1250
01:53:11,358 --> 01:53:11,895
Uncle.

1251
01:53:20,338 --> 01:53:21,480
This belongs to my dad.

1252
01:53:22,283 --> 01:53:24,076
Why did you say the
lighter belongs to brother?

1253
01:53:24,466 --> 01:53:26,220
He hadn't touched a
cigarette for 20 years!

1254
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:32,048
I knew dad didn't smoke.
This belongs to the man who killed him.

1255
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:38,025
I lied because the police cannot harm him.

1256
01:53:38,236 --> 01:53:40,731
Tell me who he is!

1257
01:53:41,112 --> 01:53:43,028
He fed brother to the fish!

1258
01:53:43,322 --> 01:53:47,025
If I don't feed him to the
maggots, shame on my name!

1259
01:53:47,243 --> 01:53:48,332
Tell me who he is!

1260
01:53:50,835 --> 01:53:54,224
Think of where you saw this lighter.

1261
01:54:05,656 --> 01:54:07,482
This lighter belongs to Pratap.

1262
01:54:11,162 --> 01:54:14,243
The scoundrel extended
his hand for relations

1263
01:54:15,698 --> 01:54:17,145
and cheated us!

1264
01:54:17,806 --> 01:54:20,385
I'll kill that bastard!

1265
01:54:21,399 --> 01:54:25,336
No! Those who work in excitement
are either under the earth

1266
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:30,136
or over the pyre.
So we must work with our senses not anger.

1267
01:54:31,196 --> 01:54:34,118
Uncle! Collect all your men.

1268
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:38,235
We'll attack Pratap together!

1269
01:54:51,842 --> 01:54:52,343
Check post?

1270
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:55,648
Now what we will do?

1271
01:54:56,072 --> 01:54:58,523
- Hide the weapons.
- Call up.

1272
01:54:59,874 --> 01:55:01,261
- Hide all the weapons.
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:55:01,533 --> 01:55:02,761
Hide your weapons.

1274
01:55:15,132 --> 01:55:16,311
Why all the cabins empty?

1275
01:55:19,239 --> 01:55:19,928
I'll check.

1276
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:32,925
Well done boys. Well done.

1277
01:56:57,319 --> 01:56:58,614
Well done! Vicky.

1278
01:57:01,492 --> 01:57:06,256
Pratap sir, I kept my promise of
killing all of Virendra's group.

1279
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,454
Not full, Just half.

1280
01:57:09,567 --> 01:57:12,287
Where's my file which Virendra had?

1281
01:57:12,699 --> 01:57:13,764
You'll get that too.

1282
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:17,889
First you keep your word of
giving Preeti into my hand.

1283
01:57:19,258 --> 01:57:19,989
Tell me, when?

1284
01:57:25,352 --> 01:57:26,821
Whenever the groom and bride wish.

1285
01:57:56,072 --> 01:57:59,874
"All I want is your heart"

1286
01:58:00,737 --> 01:58:04,479
"this much I promise"

1287
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:09,225
"get the hint, please."

1288
01:58:10,023 --> 01:58:13,860
"Should I have you,
see the wonders I work."

1289
01:58:13,915 --> 01:58:18,070
"No, that's not happening."

1290
01:58:18,564 --> 01:58:22,727
"I don't want your heart."

1291
01:58:23,058 --> 01:58:27,218
"No, that's not happening."

1292
01:58:27,756 --> 01:58:31,589
" I don't want your heart."

1293
01:58:33,076 --> 01:58:36,760
"All I want is your heart"

1294
01:58:37,601 --> 01:58:41,529
"this much I promise."

1295
01:59:12,519 --> 01:59:16,284
"Don't do any mischief."

1296
01:59:17,184 --> 01:59:20,589
"Don't be afraid of love."

1297
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:25,365
"Go on, let all that be."

1298
01:59:25,591 --> 01:59:29,626
"At least let me say something."

1299
01:59:30,676 --> 01:59:35,075
"Go on, lay off... stop bothering me."

1300
01:59:35,275 --> 01:59:39,279
"Don't drive me crazy in love."

1301
01:59:39,332 --> 01:59:43,854
"I'm leaving. Stop clinging to me."

1302
01:59:43,951 --> 01:59:48,263
"Listen, my love...
give me a bit of your love."

1303
01:59:48,296 --> 01:59:52,653
"No, that's not happening."

1304
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:57,264
" I don't want your heart."

1305
01:59:57,724 --> 02:00:01,854
"No, that's not happening."

1306
02:00:02,311 --> 02:00:06,699
" I don't want your heart."

1307
02:00:07,044 --> 02:00:11,296
"All I want is your heart"

1308
02:00:12,142 --> 02:00:16,391
"this much I promise."

1309
02:00:40,142 --> 02:00:42,826
"Stop acting crazy."

1310
02:00:44,768 --> 02:00:48,024
"Fall in love with me."

1311
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:53,101
"Let me go, I've got to go home."

1312
02:00:53,956 --> 02:00:57,496
"Don't look away.. please."

1313
02:00:58,419 --> 02:01:02,731
"How am I going to trust
you, that you will love me?"

1314
02:01:03,002 --> 02:01:06,976
"I will never betray you in love."

1315
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:11,461
"Why're you following me around?
Why're you being stubborn?"

1316
02:01:11,635 --> 02:01:16,089
"It's bad to be angry, my love...
enjoy my love right now."

1317
02:01:16,209 --> 02:01:20,348
"No, that's not happening."

1318
02:01:20,738 --> 02:01:24,985
"I don't want your heart."

1319
02:01:25,239 --> 02:01:29,384
"No, that's not happening."

1320
02:01:29,972 --> 02:01:34,134
"I don't want your heart."

1321
02:01:40,968 --> 02:01:41,618
Right.

1322
02:01:42,661 --> 02:01:43,418
Same file.

1323
02:01:44,299 --> 02:01:47,183
I can't believe somebody
can love someone so much!

1324
02:01:47,934 --> 02:01:49,914
As much as you love Preeti.

1325
02:01:50,905 --> 02:01:55,029
You killed your own dad
just because I asked you to!

1326
02:01:55,993 --> 02:01:57,114
He wasn't my dad!

1327
02:01:59,185 --> 02:02:03,209
- What?
- A bastard like him cannot be my dad!

1328
02:02:04,899 --> 02:02:09,002
I made him my dad so that I can reach him.

1329
02:02:09,827 --> 02:02:14,236
If he wasn't your dad,
how did he accept you as his son?

1330
02:02:15,421 --> 02:02:16,772
Because of his wife.

1331
02:02:18,062 --> 02:02:19,786
His son was lost years ago.

1332
02:02:20,902 --> 02:02:23,626
I went to him as his lost son.

1333
02:02:24,527 --> 02:02:29,904
And it was not difficult convincing
a mother mad for her lost son.

1334
02:02:32,912 --> 02:02:35,379
What a trick!

1335
02:02:36,212 --> 02:02:37,902
Hunted so many with one arrow!

1336
02:02:38,635 --> 02:02:42,924
Virendra's wealth,
my daughter and my trust.

1337
02:02:43,578 --> 02:02:44,596
You achieved all three of them.

1338
02:02:45,722 --> 02:02:50,492
You turned out to be
smarter than I thought.

1339
02:02:51,452 --> 02:02:53,896
Today you killed Virendra
making him your dad.

1340
02:02:54,683 --> 02:02:58,760
Tomorrow you might kill me
after I become your dad-in-law.

1341
02:03:00,219 --> 02:03:02,785
But my dear son-in-law.

1342
02:03:03,835 --> 02:03:06,387
I'm not a fool like Virendra!

1343
02:03:07,152 --> 02:03:10,558
The file has come to me. Hence...

1344
02:03:12,654 --> 02:03:13,404
Good bye.

1345
02:03:18,459 --> 02:03:20,244
My dear father-in-law.

1346
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:22,995
You're more foolish than Virendra.

1347
02:03:25,022 --> 02:03:28,662
You should check the bullets
before pressing the trigger.

1348
02:03:29,619 --> 02:03:32,184
The man who can remove your
file from Virendra's vault

1349
02:03:33,235 --> 02:03:36,443
it's not tough for him to remove
the bullets from your revolver.

1350
02:03:40,884 --> 02:03:45,174
I was joking, son!

1351
02:03:45,812 --> 02:03:48,135
Brother-in-law can be a joke.

1352
02:03:48,555 --> 02:03:49,815
Not between dad-in-law with son-in-law.

1353
02:03:52,309 --> 02:03:54,301
That is why listen to something serious.

1354
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:59,414
I have killed Virendra for
DK not for your daughter!

1355
02:04:00,910 --> 02:04:02,258
- For DK?
- Yes.

1356
02:04:03,597 --> 02:04:06,069
He gave me a contract
to kill three people.

1357
02:04:06,916 --> 02:04:09,714
One was Jaswant. The other Virendra.

1358
02:04:10,487 --> 02:04:12,069
And you're the third.

1359
02:04:14,395 --> 02:04:17,169
Bless your daughter thanks
to whom you are still alive.

1360
02:04:18,272 --> 02:04:20,867
I used her as a step to reach you.

1361
02:04:22,197 --> 02:04:25,656
But I really love her so much.

1362
02:04:26,492 --> 02:04:28,511
That I can't see her e yes with tears.

1363
02:04:29,185 --> 02:04:33,508
You won Preeti's heart earlier
today you've won mine too.

1364
02:04:34,156 --> 02:04:36,129
Forget the heart and think with the head.

1365
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:39,792
DK wants you dead to own 100%.

1366
02:04:40,427 --> 02:04:45,031
But I can kill him and make
you the complete owner.

1367
02:04:50,783 --> 02:04:52,741
- But his whereabouts?
- I know that.

1368
02:04:54,329 --> 02:04:56,370
Prepare to leave for India.

1369
02:04:57,182 --> 02:05:00,834
To kill that rascal, why just India

1370
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:03,674
I'm willing to go anywhere.

1371
02:05:05,927 --> 02:05:10,420
So far I thought I was the
luckiest girl in the world.

1372
02:05:11,274 --> 02:05:14,633
But today after listening
to my dad and Vicky

1373
02:05:15,092 --> 02:05:18,263
I've lost faith in all relations!

1374
02:05:19,254 --> 02:05:22,808
If you hear, you'll die!

1375
02:05:24,257 --> 02:05:27,142
The one you think is your
son, is not your son!

1376
02:05:28,067 --> 02:05:31,367
He became your son so that
he could kill your husband.

1377
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:33,804
Vicky killed your husband!

1378
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:37,464
He made you a widow!
He is a cheat! He is a murderer!

1379
02:05:38,634 --> 02:05:39,384
I know it.

1380
02:05:41,236 --> 02:05:42,474
He is not my son.

1381
02:05:44,738 --> 02:05:46,216
He has not cheated me.

1382
02:05:47,552 --> 02:05:51,076
In fact, to lighten mother
earth of her sinful burden

1383
02:05:51,595 --> 02:05:53,221
I supported him by becoming his mother.

1384
02:05:56,035 --> 02:05:57,828
And he didn't kill my husband!

1385
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:00,991
He punished a traitor for his sins!

1386
02:06:03,723 --> 02:06:09,078
Those who die for their
nation are called martyrs.

1387
02:06:10,292 --> 02:06:15,999
Those who kill for their country
are called soldiers not killers!

1388
02:06:19,265 --> 02:06:22,756
And this soldier's story
started not on foreign soil

1389
02:06:23,889 --> 02:06:26,574
but in the desert sands of India.

1390
02:06:28,179 --> 02:06:30,806
Where my husband and your dad

1391
02:06:31,636 --> 02:06:35,648
and their third partner,
Jaswant used to work in the military.

1392
02:06:36,602 --> 02:06:41,364
They stole arms from there and
sold it to a fourth called DK.

1393
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:49,052
Once Vicky's dad, Major Vijay
Malhotra caught them red handed.

1394
02:06:50,230 --> 02:06:54,242
To hide their crime,
these traitors killed him!

1395
02:06:54,992 --> 02:06:57,751
And blamed him for the arms theft!

1396
02:06:58,217 --> 02:07:00,698
We were going towards the
border with the truck of arms.

1397
02:07:01,025 --> 02:07:06,572
The truck had a problem so Major
Malhotra sent us to camp to get help.

1398
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:09,909
On the way we saw a
civilian driving the truck.

1399
02:07:10,022 --> 02:07:13,329
We smelled a rat and returned to see

1400
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:16,967
all the guards were dead and
Major Malhotra and his men were

1401
02:07:17,342 --> 02:07:19,569
loading the arms into their truck.

1402
02:07:20,039 --> 02:07:23,207
We challenged him and he
fired upon us in return.

1403
02:07:23,559 --> 02:07:25,473
We had to fire back to answer him.

1404
02:07:26,425 --> 02:07:29,284
On the evidence of the eye witness
account of Subhedar Pratap Singh.

1405
02:07:29,567 --> 02:07:34,298
Lance Corporal Virendra Sinha
and driver Jaswant Dalal.

1406
02:07:34,516 --> 02:07:38,522
Late Maj. Malhotra is charged with loot
of arms meant for the nation's defense

1407
02:07:38,665 --> 02:07:42,024
he is guilty of killing the
guards defending the country.

1408
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:47,855
So the army terminates his entire service.

1409
02:07:48,107 --> 02:07:52,036
We take back all the
titles, medals given to him

1410
02:07:52,112 --> 02:07:53,934
and declare him a traitor.

1411
02:07:55,195 --> 02:07:57,332
No! No!

1412
02:07:57,362 --> 02:07:58,398
Remove the decorations.

1413
02:07:58,724 --> 02:07:59,895
No!

1414
02:07:59,994 --> 02:08:02,978
He is not a traitor!

1415
02:08:03,092 --> 02:08:06,938
- Mother!
- Don't take his medals!

1416
02:08:07,058 --> 02:08:11,656
- Don't take them. Move.
- Mother.

1417
02:08:11,754 --> 02:08:12,842
- Mother!
- No!

1418
02:08:13,644 --> 02:08:20,559
Sir, you know how much
he loved his country!

1419
02:08:21,002 --> 02:08:24,444
Then why are they snatching
away the medals in front of you?

1420
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:30,151
He is a martyr not a traitor!

1421
02:08:30,826 --> 02:08:33,488
He has sacrificed himself for his country!

1422
02:08:33,538 --> 02:08:34,396
Dad.

1423
02:08:44,065 --> 02:08:45,990
We won't let the body be burnt!

1424
02:08:46,014 --> 02:08:47,738
We won't let the body to be burnt!

1425
02:08:47,762 --> 02:08:51,602
We won't let the body to be burnt!

1426
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:55,892
We won't let a traitor be
cremated on our holy land!

1427
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:59,262
Don't touch it!

1428
02:08:59,286 --> 02:09:01,892
Throw the body away!

1429
02:09:01,932 --> 02:09:04,025
- Don't touch it!

1430
02:09:04,794 --> 02:09:05,229
Mother!

1431
02:09:11,323 --> 02:09:12,755
Don't touch it!

1432
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:17,820
- Don't touch it!
- Mother!

1433
02:09:18,538 --> 02:09:20,975
- Don't touch it! No.
- Mother.

1434
02:09:21,338 --> 02:09:23,871
Leave him! Mother!

1435
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,426
Leave him!

1436
02:09:34,116 --> 02:09:35,080
Mother!

1437
02:09:38,110 --> 02:09:39,070
Mother!

1438
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,645
Dad!

1439
02:09:47,867 --> 02:09:49,060
Dad!

1440
02:09:52,143 --> 02:09:54,271
Dad!

1441
02:09:58,383 --> 02:09:59,640
Dad!

1442
02:10:04,491 --> 02:10:05,602
Dad!

1443
02:10:08,481 --> 02:10:09,562
Dad!

1444
02:10:11,541 --> 02:10:12,532
Mother!

1445
02:10:13,678 --> 02:10:15,440
Mother!

1446
02:10:16,874 --> 02:10:18,810
Mother!

1447
02:10:19,444 --> 02:10:20,454
Mother!

1448
02:10:20,858 --> 02:10:25,585
- Raju! Raju!
- Mother!

1449
02:10:31,921 --> 02:10:34,548
Mother earth took that
martyr into her lap.

1450
02:10:35,362 --> 02:10:38,444
Yet these traitors had evil intentions.

1451
02:10:39,225 --> 02:10:42,022
They put the stigma of
shame on his mother's head.

1452
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:44,583
And threw her out of the village!

1453
02:11:00,202 --> 02:11:04,912
Sister, I've come to take you and Raju.

1454
02:11:06,017 --> 02:11:07,477
We'll go and stay far away.

1455
02:11:10,226 --> 02:11:18,570
No. If I leave this place,
his soul will tell me

1456
02:11:19,687 --> 02:11:24,240
that like others me too
think he's a traitor.

1457
02:11:25,418 --> 02:11:30,375
Take Raju away if you can.

1458
02:11:34,697 --> 02:11:37,965
But how will he live without you?

1459
02:11:39,001 --> 02:11:41,275
His welfare lies in staying without me.

1460
02:11:43,402 --> 02:11:46,125
Son can forget his mother.

1461
02:11:47,663 --> 02:11:53,767
But the people here will remind
him of his dad and kill him!

1462
02:11:55,575 --> 02:11:58,462
Take him away!

1463
02:11:58,486 --> 02:12:01,732
Will you live without me, mother?

1464
02:12:02,812 --> 02:12:04,777
No, my son! No.

1465
02:12:05,415 --> 02:12:07,200
You are not going away from me.

1466
02:12:07,614 --> 02:12:12,195
You will be with me in every
moment in every breath.

1467
02:12:14,273 --> 02:12:17,610
Okay mother. I'll go if you want me to.

1468
02:12:18,223 --> 02:12:19,064
Yes, Raju.

1469
02:12:46,065 --> 02:12:50,460
And from that day, neither she saw her son

1470
02:12:51,487 --> 02:12:53,427
nor the son saw his mother.

1471
02:12:55,393 --> 02:12:59,504
For 20 years that goddess
is still in the desert

1472
02:13:00,353 --> 02:13:02,790
tolerating the barbs of the villagers

1473
02:13:03,658 --> 02:13:05,047
sitting in that same temple.

1474
02:13:11,099 --> 02:13:12,082
What's the matter?

1475
02:13:14,378 --> 02:13:19,637
I hope you are not feeling
guilty of making me a widow?

1476
02:13:22,089 --> 02:13:24,629
I considered myself a widow the day

1477
02:13:25,980 --> 02:13:32,714
when my own son died along with
other kids because of arms he sold!

1478
02:13:35,903 --> 02:13:39,818
The man who can kill the
husband's of hundreds of women

1479
02:13:40,605 --> 02:13:42,720
and is responsible for
the death of innocent kids

1480
02:13:43,586 --> 02:13:45,641
no Indian woman not only me

1481
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:50,662
will adorn her hair with
the vermilion of his name!

1482
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:54,914
I'm proud of you son!

1483
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:58,874
The day that was lowered in shame
because of my husband's deeds

1484
02:14:00,188 --> 02:14:02,122
it is held high once again.

1485
02:14:07,256 --> 02:14:09,997
It is said, of all God's gifts

1486
02:14:11,141 --> 02:14:13,357
the most precious is mother.

1487
02:14:16,747 --> 02:14:20,317
I am so lucky that I have 2 of them!

1488
02:14:25,457 --> 02:14:26,512
I am sorry, Vicky.

1489
02:14:31,545 --> 02:14:33,427
Preeti! What you did was out of ignorance.

1490
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:39,127
But after knowing what I'm going to
do, you'll hate not love me.

1491
02:14:40,988 --> 02:14:43,949
Your dad's name is top
most in my list of enemies.

1492
02:14:45,445 --> 02:14:49,424
If a wife can support you
against her husband in your fight

1493
02:14:50,384 --> 02:14:53,789
then a daughter can go
against her dad for mankind!

1494
02:15:00,130 --> 02:15:00,600
Hello.

1495
02:15:01,718 --> 02:15:02,685
I am Raj speaking.

1496
02:15:04,086 --> 02:15:07,942
Raj? Why did you call?
Keep contact only by fax.

1497
02:15:07,988 --> 02:15:12,687
No need for that now.
I'm bringing Pratap tomorrow.

1498
02:15:13,818 --> 02:15:15,502
My work here is done.

1499
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:19,680
Now I have to come there and do one job.

1500
02:15:21,058 --> 02:15:22,702
Unmask DK.

1501
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:45,966
Jaswant.

1502
02:15:53,978 --> 02:15:57,885
- Yes sir?
- The drama of my man who enacted

1503
02:15:58,035 --> 02:15:59,426
of killing you with fake bullets

1504
02:16:00,241 --> 02:16:01,743
that has made my plan succeed.

1505
02:16:02,175 --> 02:16:04,465
How long do I have to stay here?

1506
02:16:04,778 --> 02:16:06,562
There's no need for you to stay.

1507
02:16:07,201 --> 02:16:12,547
With the information you gave me my
partner killed Virendra and his men.

1508
02:16:13,785 --> 02:16:16,140
He's bringing Pratap here tomorrow.

1509
02:16:17,175 --> 02:16:19,560
So now you're free.

1510
02:16:24,245 --> 02:16:24,698
Yes.

1511
02:17:08,415 --> 02:17:09,674
It's so strange

1512
02:17:10,611 --> 02:17:14,317
the story will end where it began.

1513
02:17:15,255 --> 02:17:17,240
Looks like you know this place.

1514
02:17:17,985 --> 02:17:19,184
What's the use in hiding from you?

1515
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:23,024
Our business started from here.

1516
02:17:23,872 --> 02:17:27,683
And this is the place where
death touched us and left.

1517
02:17:28,185 --> 02:17:31,792
There was a scoundrel
Major Vijay Malhotra.

1518
02:17:33,282 --> 02:17:35,877
He thought he was the
protector of the nation!

1519
02:17:36,615 --> 02:17:37,717
He caught us.

1520
02:17:38,381 --> 02:17:42,290
If DK hadn't reached in time,
he would have killed all of us.

1521
02:17:43,317 --> 02:17:45,360
That dog was very strong!

1522
02:17:46,365 --> 02:17:48,269
But fate was with us.

1523
02:17:49,091 --> 02:17:51,526
We gave that scoundrel such a death!

1524
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:54,141
That it's quoted as an example.

1525
02:17:54,818 --> 02:17:56,038
What did you do?

1526
02:17:56,570 --> 02:17:58,620
We proved the martyr a traitor.

1527
02:17:59,378 --> 02:18:01,620
We didn't let him be cremated!

1528
02:18:05,193 --> 02:18:08,501
Some will die today too.
But won't be cremated.

1529
02:18:09,081 --> 02:18:11,987
Of DK and his men!

1530
02:18:19,949 --> 02:18:20,824
Why did you stop the car?

1531
02:18:26,876 --> 02:18:29,808
A goddess is sitting in
this temple since 20 years.

1532
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:35,637
They say anyone who sees her
gets his wishes fulfilled.

1533
02:18:37,225 --> 02:18:38,535
Let's go see her.

1534
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:43,219
I will definitely see her.

1535
02:18:44,142 --> 02:18:46,954
So that I can see DK's corpse very soon.

1536
02:20:04,384 --> 02:20:08,352
For 20 years these eyes have only
seen hatred and been shunned.

1537
02:20:10,103 --> 02:20:11,659
I have seen them everyday.

1538
02:20:13,807 --> 02:20:14,381
But...

1539
02:20:17,615 --> 02:20:23,509
for the first time,
I'm seeing eyes filled with tears.

1540
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:26,883
Raju.

1541
02:20:29,749 --> 02:20:30,296
Mother!

1542
02:20:30,926 --> 02:20:31,849
Raju.

1543
02:20:34,254 --> 02:20:36,424
- Raju.
- Mother.

1544
02:20:38,202 --> 02:20:40,931
I kept you away for 20 years!

1545
02:20:42,269 --> 02:20:46,744
Despite being a mother,
I didn't give you that love.

1546
02:20:48,612 --> 02:20:51,559
Forgive me!

1547
02:20:51,679 --> 02:20:53,839
Forgive me!

1548
02:20:53,944 --> 02:20:56,794
No, you were not away from me.

1549
02:20:57,754 --> 02:21:04,017
The dust of your feet was
always with me like a blessing.

1550
02:21:06,807 --> 02:21:11,629
Now it's time for your wait
and my pledge to be fulfilled.

1551
02:21:12,853 --> 02:21:15,406
See whom I've brought here!

1552
02:21:29,978 --> 02:21:31,954
'Your mother and son can't stay here!'

1553
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:36,461
'She won't leave like this.
We'll put such a stigma on her forehead'

1554
02:21:36,575 --> 02:21:38,289
'that she won't be able to face anyone!'

1555
02:21:38,329 --> 02:21:41,814
- 'Throw him out!
- Yes, throw him out!'

1556
02:21:48,546 --> 02:21:51,603
Leave my child!

1557
02:21:52,340 --> 02:21:54,529
Leave my child!

1558
02:21:57,695 --> 02:22:00,416
No! No! No!!!

1559
02:22:07,032 --> 02:22:09,814
'My husband is a traitor'

1560
02:22:10,528 --> 02:22:11,112
Geeta!

1561
02:22:13,523 --> 02:22:15,140
I'm the son of this goddess!

1562
02:22:18,188 --> 02:22:19,369
This is that goddess

1563
02:22:20,382 --> 02:22:24,574
of whose forehead you wrote
the stigma of shame, not pride!

1564
02:22:25,850 --> 02:22:27,672
I'm the son of Vijay Malhotra

1565
02:22:28,548 --> 02:22:31,691
who was called a traitor
despite being a martyr!

1566
02:22:32,967 --> 02:22:34,699
Do you know why I brought you here?

1567
02:22:35,799 --> 02:22:39,123
So that the soul where the
greatest injustice was done

1568
02:22:40,652 --> 02:22:42,593
justice too should be given there!

1569
02:22:44,306 --> 02:22:47,870
And my mother who has been
doing penance in this wilderness

1570
02:22:49,055 --> 02:22:51,445
can see justice being done!

1571
02:22:56,171 --> 02:22:58,280
Traitor!

1572
02:23:13,076 --> 02:23:18,117
People die but their voice don't!

1573
02:23:20,142 --> 02:23:21,821
Listen!

1574
02:23:22,641 --> 02:23:28,633
Listen to the voice of my dad's
torture in this sand!

1575
02:23:29,124 --> 02:23:30,439
Listen!

1576
02:23:36,345 --> 02:23:40,886
Listen to a child cry
and weep for his dad!

1577
02:23:42,177 --> 02:23:47,749
Hear the scream of a mother looking
for her husband's body in a storm!

1578
02:23:48,090 --> 02:23:52,242
Hear my mother's screams!

1579
02:23:55,407 --> 02:23:58,901
Listen!

1580
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:03,214
Hear my mother's screams!

1581
02:24:16,287 --> 02:24:16,976
DK.

1582
02:24:21,832 --> 02:24:23,734
Not DK but Jaswant.

1583
02:24:24,206 --> 02:24:24,701
Remove.

1584
02:24:28,489 --> 02:24:29,096
Jaswant.

1585
02:24:29,546 --> 02:24:31,354
I recognized you earlier itself.

1586
02:24:31,706 --> 02:24:35,352
You haven't come here
but been brought here.

1587
02:24:36,124 --> 02:24:39,859
According to Raju's plan I
informed you of Pratap's arrival.

1588
02:24:40,338 --> 02:24:41,708
I released you on purpose.

1589
02:24:42,478 --> 02:24:47,082
Because we know you would come
here to save him for your business.

1590
02:24:47,794 --> 02:24:51,087
And since Jaswant has
been forgiven by the law

1591
02:24:51,557 --> 02:24:55,129
you'll be tried as DK not Jaswant!

1592
02:24:55,902 --> 02:24:59,599
You cheated your partners
for their shares.

1593
02:24:59,788 --> 02:25:00,371
Not us.

1594
02:25:01,921 --> 02:25:03,251
You are under arrest.

1595
02:25:33,122 --> 02:25:34,522
Raju!

1596
02:25:37,605 --> 02:25:41,662
What did you think I'd
come alone to save my man?

1597
02:25:42,993 --> 02:25:43,935
Raju!

1598
02:25:47,002 --> 02:25:48,488
- Raju!
- Mother!

1599
02:25:49,429 --> 02:25:49,949
Mother!

1600
02:25:51,194 --> 02:25:52,634
Mother!

1601
02:25:58,685 --> 02:25:59,188
Mother!

1602
02:26:03,757 --> 02:26:06,862
Wanted me to hear screams?

1603
02:26:06,938 --> 02:26:09,308
Now you scream!

1604
02:26:09,454 --> 02:26:10,942
No! Raju!

1605
02:26:11,583 --> 02:26:12,450
Leave him.

1606
02:26:17,333 --> 02:26:18,091
Mother!

1607
02:26:19,291 --> 02:26:22,136
- Mother!
- Raju!

1608
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:25,883
- Mother!
- Beat him!

1609
02:26:26,326 --> 02:26:27,263
Raju!

1610
02:26:27,674 --> 02:26:29,018
Mother!

1611
02:26:30,042 --> 02:26:31,688
Raju!

1612
02:26:32,634 --> 02:26:34,606
- Mother!
- Raju!

1613
02:26:35,531 --> 02:26:38,416
Mother! Mother!

1614
02:26:38,779 --> 02:26:40,665
Raju!

1615
02:26:45,132 --> 02:26:46,470
Raju!

1616
02:26:57,293 --> 02:27:00,691
This rascal is Vijay Malhotra's son.

1617
02:27:01,584 --> 02:27:03,548
His dad was buried here after his death.

1618
02:27:04,529 --> 02:27:05,430
Bury him alive!

1619
02:28:44,093 --> 02:28:47,108
Mother!

1620
02:30:24,546 --> 02:30:27,597
Let's go or else he'll kill us!

1621
02:30:43,381 --> 02:30:44,491
Raju!

1622
02:31:39,242 --> 02:31:40,198
Don't kill us!

1623
02:31:40,299 --> 02:31:41,259
Forgive us.

1624
02:31:41,777 --> 02:31:45,745
I'm your dad-in-law.
Will you kill me, son?

1625
02:31:45,932 --> 02:31:47,484
No! Raju, no!

1626
02:31:48,754 --> 02:31:49,179
No!

1627
02:31:51,043 --> 02:31:52,907
I won't kill you.

1628
02:31:57,796 --> 02:31:59,447
He's so merciful!

1629
02:32:00,074 --> 02:32:02,859
After all he's my son-in-law.

1630
02:32:05,173 --> 02:32:06,062
Look up.

1631
02:32:16,255 --> 02:32:18,039
No! no.

1632
02:32:18,670 --> 02:32:22,355
These vultures will eat our flesh!

1633
02:32:22,638 --> 02:32:27,028
- Shoot us!
- Yes, kill us!

1634
02:32:27,378 --> 02:32:30,355
- For God's sake!
- I had pledged

1635
02:32:31,428 --> 02:32:34,150
that you will neither get
the flames of a cremation

1636
02:32:35,253 --> 02:32:37,119
nor the lap of mother earth!

1637
02:32:37,202 --> 02:32:38,846
- Raju No!
- No!

1638
02:32:38,870 --> 02:32:39,938
No!

1639
02:32:42,912 --> 02:32:48,204
Raju I gave false
evidence against your dad!

1640
02:32:48,595 --> 02:32:51,235
I had whipped him to death!

1641
02:32:51,490 --> 02:32:56,387
We are butchers!
Remove your revolver and kill me!

1642
02:32:56,859 --> 02:32:59,959
You are educated, sensible.
Why don't you kill us?

1643
02:33:00,250 --> 02:33:04,059
Villagers! We accept all our crimes.

1644
02:33:04,488 --> 02:33:07,854
Save us from the vultures.
We can't even walk!

1645
02:33:08,155 --> 02:33:12,452
Kill us! Wait! Where are you going?

1646
02:33:13,015 --> 02:33:16,022
On your goddess like mother's
forehead, I had written

1647
02:33:16,142 --> 02:33:20,739
your husband is a traitor!
You write on my forehead with bullets.

1648
02:33:21,197 --> 02:33:23,672
That I'm a dog, a pig, a swine!

1649
02:33:24,632 --> 02:33:27,572
- Stop!
- Don't leave us and go!

1650
02:34:00,767 --> 02:34:02,511
Guards!

1651
02:34:03,751 --> 02:34:05,185
General salute!

1652
02:34:08,281 --> 02:34:09,842
Gun salute!
