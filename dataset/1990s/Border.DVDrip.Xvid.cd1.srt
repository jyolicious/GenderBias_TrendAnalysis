1
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,595
Two minutes and 45 seconds.
You can save at least 15 seconds...

2
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:21,019
l sense a war; l've been
summoned to Head Quarters.

3
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,652
War can break out at any time.

4
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,963
and set-up a new air base there.

5
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,320
Victory to lndia!

6
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:07,418
The soldiers are here
for firing, sir!

7
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,265
Soldiers of the Punjab Regiment...

8
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:19,361
...the day we have
eagerly waited for, is here.

9
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:20,934
Orders have already arrived.

10
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,466
The Company will leave for Rajasthan
as an advanced force.

11
00:05:26,513 --> 00:05:30,882
Every bullet you carry will
now bear the enemy's name!

12
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:37,849
So, let's see, soldiers...
how will you strike?

13
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:56,099
- This is Priti here, Papa.
- Yes, dear? How is everything?

14
00:05:57,277 --> 00:06:00,007
- Nothing is right, Papa.
- Why? What's wrong, dear?

15
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:02,105
My husband is being sent
to the borders.

16
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,445
War is breaking out.

17
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:08,385
l'll die of the shock, Papa.

18
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:15,126
Could you have his transfer stalled?
You're politically well connected...

19
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:20,257
...you'll have to do
this much for me, Papa.

20
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,167
Stop worrying, dear.

21
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:28,233
- l'll have his transfer stalled.
- Very well.

22
00:06:57,203 --> 00:07:01,503
Don't worry, dear. l've had
Kuldip's transfer suspended.

23
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,008
He will not go to war.

24
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:05,471
l'm having him sent to the
Head Quarters in Delhi.

25
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:17,983
l've heard all that
you had to say.

26
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,049
l understand what you
are getting at.

27
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:23,591
And now you'd better understand
what l'm about to say.

28
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,261
lf you really have
my transfer stalled...

29
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,569
...then l will leave
this daughter of yours...

30
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,901
...for whom you are doing all this.

31
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:36,465
Listen, son...

32
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,087
Get us some chairs.

33
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:56,351
What... was that you said to Papa?

34
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:57,519
Just what you heard me say.

35
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:02,954
You had sworn by our son that
you'd never leave me. Remember?

36
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,492
Yes, l had.

37
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,459
Will you break the oath then?

38
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,069
And what if something
happens to my son?

39
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,365
l don't care.

40
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:19,673
Don't forget the oath l took
when l joined the army.

41
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:24,480
l had pledged something when
l was born in lndia.

42
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:28,752
l had sworn by this soil...

43
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:32,654
...in which l have grown
from childhood to a man!

44
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,590
l had sworn by those
alps and peaks...

45
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:40,057
...which have been protecting my
motherland for over 5000 years!

46
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,168
l had sworn allegiance to 500
million of my countrymen...

47
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:46,333
...who are born of this soil
just as l have!

48
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,442
l can sacrifice my son
for them anytime.

49
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:22,272
Forgive me, Kuldip.

50
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:26,709
My love for you had
driven me to despair.

51
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:30,147
A life without you will be
worse than death.

52
00:10:31,818 --> 00:10:34,685
lt was because of this that
l telephoned my father.

53
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,653
What if something happens
to you in the war?

54
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:44,686
Nothing will happen to me,
silly girl.

55
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:47,092
Your love Deepu's
will not let me die.

56
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,429
l'll return in one piece.
Watch out.

57
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:53,402
And that is a promise.

58
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:27,439
What makes you say that?

59
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:30,139
Your border outpost has been
kept ready by the BSF...

60
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,909
...and you only have
to take charge.

61
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:34,675
The tough job is left
to the Air Force.

62
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:40,316
We'll have to start from scratch.

63
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,009
And we don't even know how
much time we have.

64
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:51,128
Going by the situation in East
Pakistan, it's pretty certain...

65
00:11:51,964 --> 00:11:53,192
...that they will start
trouble on the Western Front.

66
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,337
As you said, Pakistan will start
trouble in the Western Front...

67
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:08,179
...but we will be the ones
to ''finish'' it.

68
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:11,049
They will fire the first bullet;
we'll finish off with the last.

69
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:17,718
With the Air Force around, l don't
think you will need to open fire.

70
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,460
Victories and defeats in wars...

71
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:25,427
...are now determined by the
strength of the Air Force, Major.

72
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,126
But it's our soldiers who bare their
chests to the offenders' bullets.

73
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:36,036
after we clear the path for you;
we will first strike at their base!

74
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:42,941
There's no end to the debate
on the superiority...

75
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:44,916
...between the Army
and the Air Force.

76
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:52,289
All we must realize is that it
takes all hues to make a garden.

77
00:12:52,658 --> 00:12:55,786
What's the fun in being alone...
Be it you or me?

78
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:58,894
Fantastic, Major! Very well said!

79
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,157
This is an emergency, Mathuradas!
All leaves have been cancelled!

80
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:32,423
But l've still sent your application
to the Brigade Headquarters.

81
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,657
l'll inform you of whatever
directions l receive.

82
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:01,121
That was Mathuradas; he
belongs to your company.

83
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:04,094
He was asking for leave in
an emergency situation.

84
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:06,996
Those who run homewards
at the sight of war...

85
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,727
...have no right to be in the army.

86
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,268
His wife is seriously ill
with cancer, he says.

87
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:16,833
You could relieve him forever, sir.

88
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,378
He could spend his life sitting
at his wife's bedside.

89
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:28,515
You will now go and take charge
of the outpost at Longewala...

90
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:31,554
...and relieve the BSF who are
presently holding fort.

91
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:34,618
120 men of your company
await you outside.

92
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:39,056
Will just a hundred and twenty men
protect the post at Longewala?!

93
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:42,257
600 soldiers will man
the post at Sangewala.

94
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:46,395
You send 600 men for Sangewala;
and l get just 120 !

95
00:14:47,707 --> 00:14:51,507
lf the enemy decides to
break through a new opening...

96
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:57,046
...they will try Sangewala,
as they did in the war of '65.

97
00:14:58,217 --> 00:15:00,685
Which means you expect them
to repeat their mistake!

98
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:06,983
Or they might just ask us which is
the safest way to enter the country!

99
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,556
The enemy will not obey us;
but you must.

100
00:15:11,197 --> 00:15:12,095
Go and take over the post.

101
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,158
Strategies are planned at
the Headquarters, you know.

102
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:17,599
Not here in our offices.

103
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:20,598
Go and meet your men.

104
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,508
Attention, soldiers!

105
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,066
Don't move!

106
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:35,178
Hail lndia!

107
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:39,022
The soldiers are ready
here at the parade, sir!

108
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,065
Don't move, soldiers!

109
00:16:16,128 --> 00:16:21,065
You didn't tell me we had a kid
among the 120 men, sir.

110
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:22,931
You're right, sir!

111
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:25,833
l am a kid.

112
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:29,065
My father was a kid, too,
when he joined the army.

113
00:16:29,975 --> 00:16:31,408
But he was such a lovable kid...

114
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:34,804
...that God took him away
from us in the war of '65.

115
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:38,181
- What was your father's name?
- Major Vir Bhan.

116
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:57,024
Ask the soldiers to mount, subedar.

117
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:12,478
l knew Major Vir Bhan
very well.

118
00:17:13,786 --> 00:17:16,050
l can't call him a friend,
because he was a senior to me.

119
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:19,013
But we were still very friendly.

120
00:17:20,025 --> 00:17:22,687
- How is your mother?
- She's all right.

121
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,727
- Though she cannot see.
- Cannot see?

122
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,233
She has lost her eye-sight in
the tears she has shed.

123
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:35,293
We can't see anything around.
lt's a desert.

124
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:04,828
Don't crib! You have a runway!
You can...

125
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:11,366
Which are our neighboring villages?

126
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:41,765
''What's the fun in being alone?
Be it you or me''

127
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,349
Here's the army to
take over from us.

128
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,983
They're mostly Sikhs. Must be
a regiment from Punjab.

129
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:09,256
''Victory to Mother lndia''

130
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,745
- Where's your Commander?
- He's away on Patrol, sir.

131
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,053
Send word over wireless that we
have arrived to take charge.

132
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:12,384
Sir!

133
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,094
- There's a message, sir.
- What is it?

134
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:22,093
They want you at the post. The army
has arrived to take charge, sir.

135
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,229
Really? And here l was...
sleeping like a log.

136
00:21:29,742 --> 00:21:33,178
How do you manage to sleep in the
sand through the night, sir?

137
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:37,673
We don't consider this land to be
our mother for nothing, Santram.

138
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,410
lt has a lot of compassion for us.

139
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,578
When it sees its children
going to sleep...

140
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:47,522
...it spreads out a protective
sheet of sand to cover us.

141
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,986
You have received the orders,
l believe?

142
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,331
This BSF company will move on
to the post at Gutaru.

143
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,831
You must know this region very well.
Mustn't you, Captain?

144
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,105
l know it as l know
my courtyard, sir.

145
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:40,772
Perhaps this is why my Headquarters
has directed me...

146
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:44,343
to join you with three of my men
in the battle here.

147
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:48,546
lt was a request from
the army headquarters.

148
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:05,898
Please ask them to light a lamp in
the Goddess's temple everyday, sir.

149
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,442
Do you see the Goddess's
temple there, sir?

150
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:20,879
My soldiers want you to light a
lamp for the Goddess everyday.

151
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:25,419
A lamp will be lit everyday
and prayers offered, too.

152
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,962
They believe that the Goddess will
protect this post, if you do that.

153
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,427
Make a point to remember
that, Kartar Singh.

154
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:04,526
Glory be to Mother lndia!

155
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:24,139
Move it... yes, from there.

156
00:24:29,555 --> 00:24:32,888
Ask the soldiers to get their
fill of water from the well.

157
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:36,289
Get the water you want, soldiers!

158
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:39,820
- Get a bucket, feller!
- l'm dying of thirst!

159
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:44,000
- l'm longing to have a bath...
- Hold it, guys... Wait!

160
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:47,697
Wait, l say! Freeze!

161
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,303
Out of my way!

162
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,040
None of you will even
touch the water!

163
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:57,805
Let me first take the water
l need for cooking...

164
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:02,879
...you can drown in it
after that, for all l care!

165
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:09,426
- Are you issuing that order?
- Yes.

166
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:13,427
- Although l am very much here?
- Of course.

167
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,428
Do you know whom you
are talking to?

168
00:25:18,537 --> 00:25:21,734
l know you're an officer...
a high-ranking one.

169
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:24,208
Your wish is my command, sir...

170
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:26,376
...but l will say this much.

171
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,842
Nourishment makes the soldier;
it's not the other way around.

172
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:35,676
No army in the world can ever
fight on an empty stomach!

173
00:25:38,256 --> 00:25:41,487
You talk too much for a cook,
don't you?

174
00:25:44,296 --> 00:25:45,263
l hope you don't
take offence, sir...

175
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,725
...Bhagiram cooks as lovingly
as the acid tongue he uses.

176
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,560
Many high-ranking officers take
everything he says jokingly.

177
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:57,875
And why not? lt's because of my food
that they've risen in the ranks!

178
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:12,118
Watch what happens when you
eat the food l cook, sir!

179
00:26:12,824 --> 00:26:15,088
You will go places!

180
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:18,495
Let's go, buddy.

181
00:26:43,388 --> 00:26:47,757
Here comes Subedar Ratan Singh
... to die here!

182
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:00,427
You've got just two
anti-tank guns!

183
00:27:01,073 --> 00:27:03,507
Do the top-brass think the enemy
has only a couple of tanks?

184
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:06,500
Let them have a couple
of hundred, sir.

185
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,680
You don't need to worry, so long
as Ratan Singh is around!

186
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,350
Are you going to stop them
with your hands and feet?

187
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:18,281
lndeed, sir. l'd thrust my head
into their tanks, if need be...

188
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,824
...to silence them, sir.

189
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:22,824
You can't ever change, Ratan Singh.

190
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:26,122
You must be hungry as usual.
lsn't it?

191
00:27:26,598 --> 00:27:28,122
l'm so terribly hungry, sir...

192
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:31,897
...l could grill the
enemy's tanks in my tandoor!

193
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:37,003
Go ahead then. Bhagiram is
waiting for you.

194
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:48,714
Greetings, Bhagiram!

195
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:52,648
Cursed luck, Bhagiram!

196
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:55,655
Did you curse your luck
when you saw me?

197
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:58,495
- Yes, l did.
- Why? Didn't you like my arrival?

198
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:02,861
My word! As if our friendship
has gone to the dogs!

199
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:08,401
l wonder what the lndian army
holds against me.

200
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:12,472
They send you behind me,
wherever l'm posted!

201
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:15,970
Don't blame the army,
if you take my opinion.

202
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:18,814
l suggest you meet
a wise astrologer.

203
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:21,578
You'd find him somewhere
among the bad stars.

204
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:23,616
The bad stars have no class.

205
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:28,084
This man is a demon-incarnate,
born to torment me!

206
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,885
ls this how you treat me for
our years of friendship?!

207
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:35,498
To hell with our friendship!
l just have to cook now!

208
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:39,101
You've been cooking for
a 120 soldiers, right?

209
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:44,505
Start cooking for
130 men from today.

210
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:48,068
- Where have 10 guys sprung from?
- Can't you see?!

211
00:28:48,547 --> 00:28:54,008
- Here's one... two... three...
- Stop it, l say!

212
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,760
- Buddy boy!
- You're a pal!

213
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,889
- How far is the border from here?
- lt's just 16 kms., sir.

214
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:09,461
Are the villages around the border
friendly to us?

215
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:11,426
They used to be, sir.

216
00:29:12,404 --> 00:29:16,500
Many moved across the border
during the war of 1965.

217
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:20,940
They're all related. And some of
them are informers, too, sir.

218
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:25,104
Start a full-scale checking of
the villages from tomorrow.

219
00:29:25,784 --> 00:29:27,684
- Shall we use force, sir?
- Only if necessary.

220
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:34,381
These two happen to be
the narrow paths to the border.

221
00:29:34,793 --> 00:29:37,728
They link us to Border
Post # 635 and 638.

222
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:41,265
l'd like to examine the paths
and the border-pillars.

223
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,324
Certainly, sir. You can see the
Pakistani bunkers from across them.

224
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:49,398
Prepare to leave for
the border early tomorrow.

225
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:10,828
There's pillar # 635, sir.

226
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:26,170
Don't remain standing, sir.

227
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:28,169
The enemy's snipers
fly around dangerously.

228
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:49,228
What madness is he up to?!
Please stop him!

229
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:18,556
That lndian officer seems
to be mad, doesn't he?

230
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,092
l could lay him flat,
if you wish, sir.

231
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:23,728
Hold it.

232
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,370
Madness and love have a
strange old relationship.

233
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:35,579
The Major seems to
love his country...

234
00:31:35,914 --> 00:31:39,509
...as much as l love the
soil of these deserts.

235
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,080
ln which case, he's bound
to be given a medal someday.

236
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,725
My father was given one, too.

237
00:31:51,062 --> 00:31:53,121
He was also a victim
of this madness.

238
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:58,559
He left behind a medal and
a blind mother for me.

239
00:32:43,615 --> 00:32:44,809
May l ask you a question, sir?

240
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,340
Sure. Go ahead.

241
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,786
ls there no difference between
bravery and madness?

242
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:57,121
That which you consider madness is
a result of one's belief.

243
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:02,163
l strongly believe that my life and
death are in the Almighty's hands.

244
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:07,431
And my Almighty is with me...
not with the enemy!

245
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:11,839
Because l am always
in His protection.

246
00:33:16,014 --> 00:33:18,141
These are the villages that
are most endangered, sir.

247
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:22,411
Because they use these
very paths for movement.

248
00:33:25,924 --> 00:33:27,255
There are Pakistani's on
the wireless system, sir.

249
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,056
- On our frequency?!
- They want to talk to you, sir.

250
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:36,099
Yes? This is Kuldip Singh here.

251
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,566
We know you have arrived,
Kuldip Singh Chandpuri.

252
00:33:40,171 --> 00:33:43,834
You're posted at Longewala with the
23rd Regiment of the Punjab, right?

253
00:33:44,242 --> 00:33:45,174
We have been waiting for you.

254
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:48,343
Perhaps you are destined
to die in Longewale.

255
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:51,273
Run away from the post,
if you wish to escape death!

256
00:33:51,983 --> 00:33:53,143
You can't escape us!

257
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:57,785
Should you die, your wife can
always get married again.

258
00:33:58,456 --> 00:33:59,684
But what happens of your son?

259
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:03,317
All you can do is to
indulge in cheap talk!

260
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:06,287
Will you keep nagging us
like women?

261
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:08,398
Face me, if you're man enough...

262
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,564
...and you'll know whether l'm here
to die, or to wreak havoc on you!

263
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:18,640
Don't you guys dare to set foot
on our soil!

264
00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:23,411
Longewala does not have space for
a graveyard for all of you!

265
00:34:24,115 --> 00:34:28,677
As for my son... you're
a bunch of cheapsters!

266
00:34:29,254 --> 00:34:34,123
Even my son could
put you to shame!

267
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:56,679
Let them advance, sir!

268
00:34:57,916 --> 00:35:01,044
We will build a graveyard for
them, sir! We certainly will!

269
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:05,980
lt's the villagers who must've
passed on the information to them.

270
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,986
They keep going across
the border very often.

271
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:26,440
They've lit a fire
in the ruins, sir.

272
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:30,871
l wonder who they are and
what they are doing here.

273
00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:01,035
- What is the matter, sir?
- Who are you?

274
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:05,481
We're travelling to Tanaud for a
visit to the Goddess's temple.

275
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:10,211
They're on their way to Tanaud,
to the Goddess's temple, sir.

276
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:13,319
- Where do you come from?
- From village Dongra, sir.

277
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:18,022
l thought we'd eat and rest and
give our camels a break, too, sir.

278
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:42,352
There's nothing on them.

279
00:36:46,357 --> 00:36:48,882
Go ahead and eat.

280
00:37:08,246 --> 00:37:10,578
D'you see the grass the
camels are feeding on, sir?

281
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:17,919
The grass is green.

282
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,554
Out here in the deserts, we don't
have green grass for miles.

283
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:30,258
Across the border in Pakistan,
however, they do have such grass.

284
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:08,660
He seems to have encountered death
for the first time, sir.

285
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,732
Ask him to get used to it!

286
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:14,634
This man can't be Major
Vir Bhan Singh's son!

287
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,206
Forget killing the enemy...

288
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,342
...he throws up at the
sight of their blood!

289
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:28,417
You can't win a war by being
martyred at the hands of the enemy!

290
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,481
Wars are won by slaying the enemy!

291
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,569
Shove that thing behind!

292
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:55,208
l remember a film l saw, Rafi, in
which the villain tells the hero...

293
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:58,979
...you mustn't mess around with guns;
they're not for kids!

294
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:30,246
What's up, lieutenant?
Why aren't you asleep?

295
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:53,101
Your father was martyred in
the war of '65, wasn't he?

296
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:55,899
Obviously. He was in the army.

297
00:40:57,341 --> 00:41:00,242
Do you really hold the
lndian army responsible...

298
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:01,976
...for your father's death?

299
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:04,646
Yes!

300
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,013
Then why did you join the Force?

301
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:19,753
My father had invoked his love and
extracted a promise from me,...

302
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:21,362
...that l would join the army!

303
00:41:23,601 --> 00:41:25,159
And why did he extract
the promise from you?

304
00:41:27,104 --> 00:41:32,633
Because his love for the nation was
the biggest love he had ever known.

305
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:37,679
Which made him shackle his son
in this uniform!

306
00:41:39,383 --> 00:41:45,322
l have been given a gun to shoot
down the soldier l encounter.

307
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:51,390
A soldier who is a son to some woman;
a soldier l've never met before.

308
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,863
A soldier who has done
no harm to me!

309
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,936
A soldier whom l do even know!

310
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:02,438
Why must l kill him? What for?

311
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:08,970
Because he will kill you,
if you don't kill him.

312
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:15,075
Who will trample upon your body to
tread on the soil of your motherland!

313
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:20,885
And this free land will once again
be shackled in chains of slavery!

314
00:42:22,193 --> 00:42:25,594
We don't even cast a look at
the land the others possess.

315
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:28,688
But we're not such
worthless children...

316
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,260
...to watch silently, as they
eye our motherland!

317
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:48,813
Keep your eyes on the enemy!
Do not even blink!

318
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,033
Let's forget these serious things.

319
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:14,808
You're a young officer, Dharmveer...

320
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:19,644
Your mother must surely have
chosen a bride for you, right?

321
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:22,876
Did you see her, too?

322
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:26,955
Did you like her?

323
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:31,193
The beauty of it is that
she liked me.

324
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:33,827
This is the right mood!
How did it all happen?

325
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:39,729
Nothing much. l returned to my
village, after my commissioning.

326
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:46,706
Just when the bus ground
to a halt...

327
00:43:58,155 --> 00:43:59,087
Auntie!

328
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:04,520
Auntie!

329
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:08,564
He's here, auntie! He has arrived!

330
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,200
He has arrived, auntie!
He's here at last!

331
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:16,931
- Really?
- l swear!

332
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,557
Mother!

333
00:44:36,694 --> 00:44:41,256
Not there at my feet, son...
You must come close to my heart!

334
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:49,836
You ought to be in
my heart, my son!

335
00:44:50,307 --> 00:44:54,903
l will bless you from the
bottom of my heart, son.

336
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:56,444
Greetings.

337
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:07,647
How have you been? ...and what's
this? You've started shaving!

338
00:45:08,726 --> 00:45:10,717
My son has grown up!

339
00:45:11,428 --> 00:45:15,091
However much l may grow,
l will always be your son, Mom.

340
00:45:19,003 --> 00:45:20,197
You have weakened!

341
00:45:21,172 --> 00:45:24,573
Doesn't the army feed you well?

342
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:28,106
He's just fine!
He hasn't weakened at all.

343
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:30,111
You won't understand this.

344
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:36,709
You can't see, what a mother
can feel with her hands.

345
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:39,055
Well, all right.
You can rest assured...

346
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:42,692
...that l won't cast
an evil eye on your son.

347
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:45,992
l've already got what l wanted.

348
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:49,691
What are you talking about?
l don't understand a word.

349
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:52,767
lt's good that you
don't understand.

350
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:54,964
Shall we move now?

351
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:00,006
- What are you doing?!
- lt's okay!

352
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:10,380
There you are, auntie!
My parents have arrived, too.

353
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:19,254
Congratulations! Dharmveer has
returned as an officer!

354
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,524
Bless you, son.

355
00:46:24,335 --> 00:46:26,064
Heartiest congratulations, sister!

356
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:31,536
Thank God! Vir Bhan's family
is happy again.

357
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:36,737
God willing, Dharmveer must
get married soon, too.

358
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:41,845
l'll go and fetch some tea.

359
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,896
Try this one.

360
00:47:00,204 --> 00:47:02,968
For all the mangoes l've had,
this one is incomparable!

361
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:07,977
lt has love in its juices!
... the idiot!

362
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:18,449
l must go and light the oven.

363
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,255
You must eat with us
before you leave, son.

364
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:25,055
Enjoy yourselves, kids.
l'll take a look at the fields.

365
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:19,705
What are you up to?!

366
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:29,449
- What have you done?!
- Why did you dirty my shirt?

367
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:30,723
You were so taken up
with the mango...

368
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:32,585
...couldn't you pay some
attention to me?

369
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,761
- Why? Don't you like mangoes?
- No! l don't!

370
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,464
- What do you like then?
- Must l tell you?

371
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,547
Mother!

372
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:55,750
Kammu! Come back here!

373
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:58,612
- Mother...!
- l'm coming after you!

374
00:49:08,899 --> 00:49:10,662
Come back here, l say!

375
00:54:15,505 --> 00:54:16,437
Are you back, son?

376
00:54:17,541 --> 00:54:20,203
Yes, Mom. What are you making?

377
00:54:21,078 --> 00:54:23,137
l'm weaving a bridal gear
for my son.

378
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:27,715
A bridal-gear for me?!

379
00:54:28,385 --> 00:54:32,116
- For my marriage?
- You're the only one l have.

380
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:36,217
Have you found a
bride for me, too?

381
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,459
l don't need to. There's just
one girl whom we all like.

382
00:54:43,767 --> 00:54:48,033
- Who's that?
- Who else, but the lovable Kammo!

383
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:51,571
No! Not that snob?!

384
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:54,373
She always has her nose up in
the air! l will not marry her!

385
00:54:55,312 --> 00:54:58,645
- What are you saying?!
- Just what you've heard, Mom.

386
00:54:59,516 --> 00:55:02,815
lmpossible! lt's Kammo
you must marry!

387
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,686
And l've made up my mind that she's
the one l will never marry! Never!

388
00:55:08,859 --> 00:55:12,124
Why must you be so angry?!
What's wrong with her?

389
00:55:13,263 --> 00:55:16,130
You just can't see
what's wrong with her!

390
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:17,998
The rustic idiot can't be wife
to an army officer!

391
00:55:20,537 --> 00:55:24,530
Why are you flinging things around?
Why must you be so angry?

392
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:28,374
Won't l get angry? l insist
l don't want that girl!

393
00:55:28,912 --> 00:55:32,746
But you're being stubborn that
l marry Kamla alone!

394
00:55:34,217 --> 00:55:35,184
You can't do this, son.

395
00:55:36,386 --> 00:55:42,450
Kamla and her parents have long
dreamt of getting her married to you.

396
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:44,986
But l can't ruin my life
for someone's dreams!

397
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:49,197
All right.

398
00:55:51,568 --> 00:56:03,469
l won't insist. l'll beg her father's
forgiveness, with folded hands.

399
00:56:04,314 --> 00:56:08,614
They've had the hope, ever
since you were little kids.

400
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,347
l'm not sure if he
will forgive me.

401
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,824
- Where are you off to, Mom?
- Leave me alone!

402
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:18,057
But l've only been joking!

403
00:56:19,863 --> 00:56:22,297
- ls that the truth?
- Yes. l've been joking!

404
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:25,491
- Do you approve of Kamla then?
- Yes, l do.

405
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:32,231
May you live long, my son!

406
00:56:34,044 --> 00:56:36,444
l'll have you both engaged
tomorrow itself.

407
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:18,518
l've heard it on the radio that
war is about to break out.

408
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:20,283
An emergency has been clamped...

409
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,257
...and the leave of army-men
has been cancelled.

410
00:57:22,692 --> 00:57:24,353
They're being asked
to report for duty.

411
00:57:39,943 --> 00:57:43,811
What's wrong, son? Why have
they stopped singing?

412
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:49,385
Continue singing!

413
00:57:51,187 --> 00:57:52,950
You folks may please leave.

414
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,564
Why are you leaving?!

415
00:58:04,334 --> 00:58:09,670
Dharam! Why are they leaving, son?

416
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:13,675
- Sit down here...
- Where is Kammo?

417
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:21,043
What's wrong? Tell me.

418
00:58:21,785 --> 00:58:24,686
My leave has been cancelled, Mom.
l will have to return.

419
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:29,487
- Where to?
- War is about to break out.

420
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:42,935
Won't you wear the bridal gear
l've made, son?

421
00:58:43,306 --> 00:58:46,366
lt's still not complete, mom.
First finish making it.

422
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:48,371
l will wear it after
l have returned.

423
00:58:51,147 --> 00:58:59,452
No... l will not let you leave.

424
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:04,783
Don't be stubborn. You know l can't
stay back, even if l wish to.

425
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:06,956
No!

426
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:18,736
Please, son...
have mercy on your mother!

427
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:27,747
My eyes can't continue
to wait for you anymore.

428
00:59:30,053 --> 00:59:39,451
Nor do l have the tears
l can shed for you.

429
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,727
Don't make it difficult for me, Mom.
l must leave.

430
00:59:47,837 --> 00:59:49,532
- l will have to leave!
- No!

431
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:54,442
- No!
- l must leave!

432
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,874
l will have to leave!

433
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:02,915
No! l will not let you go away...

434
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,750
No. l won't let him leave...

435
01:00:09,793 --> 01:00:11,124
l will stop him!

436
01:00:12,328 --> 01:00:13,590
l won't let him go.

437
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:20,694
l won't let him go!
l will stop him.

438
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:50,460
Kammo? You?

439
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:54,299
You thought you'd leave
without informing anyone.

440
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:58,462
But l had already decided
that l would see you off.

441
01:00:59,542 --> 01:01:01,669
So l can receive you again,
when you return.

442
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,944
Would you mind if l walked
with you to the bus-stand?

443
01:01:08,651 --> 01:01:10,016
Let's go.

444
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:18,049
l will not let him go away!
l will stop him!

445
01:01:46,456 --> 01:01:49,516
There's something l want
to tell you, Kammo.

446
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:51,984
Go ahead.

447
01:01:56,432 --> 01:02:00,596
lf l don't return... you must
marry someone else.

448
01:02:18,388 --> 01:02:19,047
You're laughing?!

449
01:02:20,924 --> 01:02:21,788
l happened to remember something.

450
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:26,418
l saw a madman doing
strange things in Agra.

451
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:31,797
He used to look back...
shut his eyes...

452
01:02:32,468 --> 01:02:35,960
look around himself...
angrily sit on the floor!

453
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:38,539
He'd then start throwing
blows around!

454
01:02:39,008 --> 01:02:40,498
He'd turn this way and that...

455
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:47,043
...run some distance, look back
and lie down again!

456
01:02:47,617 --> 01:02:49,983
He'd suddenly get up and
start running around!

457
01:02:50,787 --> 01:02:52,379
D'you know what he
was trying to do?

458
01:02:54,257 --> 01:02:57,021
He was trying to get
rid of his shadow!

459
01:03:19,048 --> 01:03:25,783
l am your shadow, silly boy!
You can't get rid of me.

460
01:03:41,404 --> 01:03:42,268
l must make a move.

461
01:03:48,711 --> 01:03:49,336
Listen...

462
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,778
Look after yourself.

463
01:04:32,855 --> 01:04:36,552
l didn't even have the courage to
look back at her from the bus.

464
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:40,653
Her eyes must surely have
followed the bus drive away...

465
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:50,571
You've heard my story. Won't you
tell me something about yourself?

466
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:56,604
Mine is the same old story
of the King and the Queen.

467
01:04:58,081 --> 01:04:59,139
l'm a Rajput.

468
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:03,741
My forefathers once ruled
this part of the country.

469
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:09,183
l'm the company of
a blue-blooded man!

470
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:17,528
Love blossomed with youth and that
brought Phool Kanwar into my life.

471
01:05:18,301 --> 01:05:19,598
She's the daughter of a princely
family from a neighboring village.

472
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,964
She became my bride.

473
01:05:24,874 --> 01:05:28,105
l can never forget
that nuptial night.

474
01:05:43,726 --> 01:05:45,751
Orders for you from the
Head Quarters, Sir.

475
01:06:02,345 --> 01:06:04,506
There was my bride;
before my eyes.

476
01:06:05,114 --> 01:06:10,108
And in my hand l held a
call from my motherland.

477
01:06:10,586 --> 01:06:13,111
Very well. l will leave for
the border at daybreak.

478
01:06:13,756 --> 01:06:15,519
Thank you very much.

479
01:06:57,467 --> 01:07:01,494
Something wrong? What were the BSF
doing here at this hour?

480
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:06,735
They were here to congratulate me
on behalf of the battalion.

481
01:07:09,912 --> 01:07:13,439
A congratulatory message
does not upset someone.

482
01:07:15,751 --> 01:07:20,415
Haven't you heard of people being
helpless; that's how l look!

483
01:07:20,823 --> 01:07:23,155
Don't you say a word
against my husband!

484
01:13:58,053 --> 01:14:03,081
What happens, if we don't return?

485
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:08,590
Have faith, Bhairav Singh.
We will surely go back.

486
01:14:11,901 --> 01:14:13,892
How else will God answer for the
loss of Phool Kanwar's husband...

487
01:14:14,169 --> 01:14:16,865
...and for Kamla's youth?

488
01:14:21,877 --> 01:14:26,075
Preparations are afoot here and
the lndians are bracing themselves.

489
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:29,681
This is a Pakistani informer
on the frequency, sir!

490
01:14:30,853 --> 01:14:32,286
- On our frequency?!
- Yes, sir.

491
01:14:33,989 --> 01:14:37,083
Their anti-tank guns are
positioned to the left.

492
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:39,589
Could you somehow
trace this swine?

493
01:14:39,995 --> 01:14:42,930
l think he's in a radius of
10 kilometres to the west.

494
01:14:43,432 --> 01:14:44,160
Let's go!

495
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:09,555
l don't know, sir!

496
01:15:10,726 --> 01:15:11,317
Get the jeep.

497
01:15:35,517 --> 01:15:36,108
That way, sir.

498
01:15:41,957 --> 01:15:43,254
He must be holed up in
one of those houses.

499
01:16:19,795 --> 01:16:25,427
There are about 120 soldiers in
this regiment of the lndian army.

500
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:49,217
He's dead!

501
01:17:52,654 --> 01:17:56,681
Didn't you ask me to get
used to this, sir?

502
01:17:57,059 --> 01:17:57,991
l've done it!

503
01:18:20,349 --> 01:18:21,976
Hand over the body
to his family.

504
01:18:22,484 --> 01:18:24,816
lf it remains unclaimed,
give it a decent burial.

505
01:18:38,967 --> 01:19:03,190
- Who is this?
- Not ''is'' ; he used to be.

506
01:19:03,892 --> 01:19:05,257
An informer of the enemy.

507
01:19:05,894 --> 01:19:06,792
Who killed him, sir?

508
01:19:08,964 --> 01:19:14,197
Kids grow up, as they play
with their toys, you know.

509
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:25,241
ls the border-pillar clear?

510
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:30,413
Everything is clear; we see no
movement of the enemy.

511
01:19:38,193 --> 01:19:41,492
D'you think the Pakistanis are crazy
to break into this stretch of land?

512
01:19:42,631 --> 01:19:45,623
They will go to Punjab or Kashmir,
where's there's greenery and joy.

513
01:19:46,235 --> 01:19:49,363
A jackal goes berserk when its
death approaches, my friend.

514
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:51,205
But what will they find here?!

515
01:19:51,707 --> 01:19:54,505
A god-forsaken desert
for miles together!

516
01:19:54,843 --> 01:19:57,334
You end up eating half a kilo of
sand, even if you don't want to!

517
01:19:59,114 --> 01:20:01,639
No matter how the land is!
lt belongs to us!

518
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:04,342
That's all very well. But what
does this land possess?

519
01:20:05,988 --> 01:20:08,047
What does it breed?
Shrubs and scorpions?

520
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:13,027
You perhaps don't know...
this land breeds lions, too.

521
01:20:15,364 --> 01:20:18,265
ln which case, lions from this
sand must be made of clay!

522
01:20:18,734 --> 01:20:22,568
You're wrong! They'd any day
consign someone to the dust!

523
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:25,835
What are you getting at?

524
01:20:26,441 --> 01:20:31,344
Had you not been in the army,
l'd have given you an explanation.

525
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:32,539
Really?

526
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,936
There! l'm no longer in uniform.
What do you wish to explain?

527
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,917
My hands speak better
than my mouth!

528
01:21:32,074 --> 01:21:33,666
You have abused my motherland!

529
01:21:34,343 --> 01:21:35,742
You have abused my mother!

530
01:21:47,923 --> 01:21:49,288
He has abused my motherland, sir!

531
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:52,183
l consider this land
to be my mother, sir!

532
01:21:52,561 --> 01:21:56,588
And the swine says it's a
barren piece of useless land!

533
01:21:56,898 --> 01:21:58,866
He says it breeds only
shrubs and scorpions!

534
01:21:59,267 --> 01:22:04,569
Tell me, sir! Won't children love
their mother, if she is ugly?

535
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:06,773
Do they have no
respect for her?

536
01:22:07,743 --> 01:22:10,735
This man has dared
to abuse my mother!

537
01:22:30,098 --> 01:22:33,261
Apologize to Bhairav Singh,
Mathura Das.

538
01:22:34,736 --> 01:22:39,036
Embrace him as you would embrace
an errant brother, Bhairav.

539
01:22:44,312 --> 01:22:47,611
Go on. Be a good boy.

540
01:22:49,251 --> 01:22:49,808
Forgive me.

541
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:11,339
We're sick of waiting
for the enemy, sir.

542
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:22,712
Why haven't you married, sir?

543
01:23:25,454 --> 01:23:27,251
l thought l'd always
be a free bird.

544
01:23:27,656 --> 01:23:30,318
But l met a girl who refused
to bow to anyone.

545
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:33,690
You're an atheist, all right.
But why must you hate God?

546
01:23:34,496 --> 01:23:37,556
l hate everything man has made
to suit his convenience.

547
01:23:38,066 --> 01:23:39,795
The idea of God happens
to be one of them.

548
01:23:40,969 --> 01:23:43,437
But there has to be a Supreme
Power to whom you bow.

549
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:46,132
No, sir. l bow to none.

550
01:23:47,042 --> 01:23:49,806
Forget God. l'd make you bow
to a mere human being.

551
01:23:50,345 --> 01:23:52,006
Will you really? Try it!

552
01:24:00,222 --> 01:24:04,556
On the condition that
we will share the coffee!

553
01:24:10,332 --> 01:24:15,668
You will stay at a particular place
for 5 minutes at eight tomorrow.

554
01:24:45,033 --> 01:24:49,231
- l bow to none, she says!
- And what happened, sir?

555
01:25:00,282 --> 01:25:01,681
That's no way of bringing
someone to his knees!

556
01:25:02,184 --> 01:25:03,583
The fact remains! You did
bow to someone!

557
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:05,411
Death could scare anyone!

558
01:25:06,354 --> 01:25:09,187
You could call God a scare, too!
l'm sure He won't mind!

559
01:25:10,225 --> 01:25:12,455
Saying sorry won't help!

560
01:25:35,684 --> 01:25:38,448
l won the bet, all right.
But my wings have been clipped!

561
01:25:38,787 --> 01:25:39,617
l've decided to marry her.

562
01:25:40,655 --> 01:25:43,556
You guys will have to dance when
you join my wedding procession!

563
01:26:03,011 --> 01:26:04,808
My son!

564
01:26:08,216 --> 01:26:10,514
l've brought your
bridal gear, son...

565
01:26:17,392 --> 01:26:18,723
Mother!

566
01:26:52,861 --> 01:26:54,692
The movement of our
troops has begun, sir.

567
01:26:56,464 --> 01:27:01,265
l don't think we will have to wait
much longer for the enemy.

568
01:27:33,735 --> 01:27:37,728
You know everything, sir. When do
you think we will see some action?

569
01:27:38,606 --> 01:27:41,006
The bloody enemy neither fights
nor lets us remain in peace!

570
01:27:41,743 --> 01:27:43,870
Patience, Gurnam! Be patient!

571
01:27:46,948 --> 01:27:50,281
We're sick of being hold up
here for months, sir.

572
01:27:50,952 --> 01:27:52,783
Why don't we simply
get it over with?

573
01:27:58,827 --> 01:28:02,126
To hell with the enemy! Give us
the clearance to advance.

574
01:28:02,564 --> 01:28:05,499
We can do nothing about that.
Just hold on to your position.

575
01:28:14,509 --> 01:28:16,875
- Hail lndia, sir!
- Hail lndia!

576
01:28:17,178 --> 01:28:17,974
ls everything all right?

577
01:28:18,913 --> 01:28:21,848
Has my leave been
sanctioned, Subedar?

578
01:28:22,517 --> 01:28:25,213
What's your problem that you're
dying to go home, Mathura Das?

579
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:31,923
My problem is that my wife
is dying of cancer.

580
01:28:33,027 --> 01:28:35,188
There's no one to even give a
glass of water to my child!

581
01:28:36,731 --> 01:28:39,791
We've been rotting here for months!
Without a godammed letter!

582
01:28:41,302 --> 01:28:43,167
l can understand your
feelings, Mathura Das.

583
01:29:02,891 --> 01:29:06,520
Here comes the mail, guys!
A letter from my beloved has come!

584
01:29:07,896 --> 01:29:10,126
Come over, guys!
Here come the letters!

585
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:26,071
How about my letter?

586
01:29:48,403 --> 01:29:50,997
Know what? My brother has passed
in the examinations.

587
01:29:56,921 --> 01:29:58,684
- What is this?
- A letter, of course.

588
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:00,589
- You tell me.
- lt's a letter.

589
01:30:02,493 --> 01:30:04,051
What a shame! Have you guys
seen me so happy recently?

590
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:08,497
- No, sir.
- My leave has been sanctioned!

591
01:30:08,799 --> 01:30:09,823
l'm going home!

592
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:17,999
What's the time, Ram Singh?

593
01:30:19,477 --> 01:30:22,241
- lt's a quarter to two.
- Time for the bus! Bye...

594
01:30:24,549 --> 01:30:31,785
Jeet! l'm going home! Do you want me
to say something to your wife?

595
01:30:32,089 --> 01:30:34,319
- Just that everything is all right.
- Very well.. Bye!

596
01:30:39,197 --> 01:30:43,156
Manjeet! Let's shake, pal!

597
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:45,765
l've got my leave;
l'm going home!

598
01:30:46,237 --> 01:30:48,000
lt's good that someone
is getting away.

599
01:30:48,573 --> 01:30:50,507
Sit there with
long faces, you guys!

600
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,137
Here l go!

601
01:30:59,483 --> 01:31:02,782
Sukhdev! l'm going home! Anything
to convey to your folks?

602
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,248
- Ask them to keep writing.
- Sure. l will do that!

603
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:09,255
So long! l'm leaving!

604
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:20,669
Mr. Ratan Singh!
My leave has been sanctioned!

605
01:31:22,173 --> 01:31:25,609
That's good. You've got a
break then, haven't you?

606
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,705
Now go and look after
your wife.

607
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:34,484
Mr. Mathura Das! You are delighted
to be going home!

608
01:31:36,187 --> 01:31:39,782
But the ugly manner in which you
have demonstrated your happiness...

609
01:31:40,391 --> 01:31:41,688
...is totally unwarranted!

610
01:31:43,327 --> 01:31:46,763
Your leave has been sanctioned
because you have a problem at home.

611
01:31:48,232 --> 01:31:50,427
But who does not have
problems in the world?

612
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:54,197
ln fact, life itself
is a problem!

613
01:32:02,947 --> 01:32:04,107
Now tell me!

614
01:32:05,383 --> 01:32:10,252
Do you know of the hero in our midst
whose widowed mother cannot see...

615
01:32:11,489 --> 01:32:16,825
...but whose son is lost here
in the sands of the desert?

616
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:22,999
D'you know of the hero whose
mother's mortal remains wait...

617
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:27,198
...for him to return victorious from
war and complete the rites?

618
01:32:30,007 --> 01:32:34,944
One of these men has his father
fighting for his life.

619
01:32:35,313 --> 01:32:38,214
A man who wards off his death
every day on the pretext...

620
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:43,712
...that the one to cremate him is
defending the borders of the nation!

621
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:50,850
lf each one of them were to make
excuses and go on leave...

622
01:32:51,662 --> 01:32:54,130
...how will we win this war?!

623
01:32:54,665 --> 01:32:55,597
Speak up!

624
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,526
Aren't you man enough?!

625
01:33:03,841 --> 01:33:09,711
Before l declare you a traitor
and gun you down...

626
01:33:10,715 --> 01:33:13,513
...just run away from here!

627
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:55,887
What he said is right.

628
01:33:56,394 --> 01:33:59,295
Who will fight the enemy

629
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:10,941
The Major is like a coconut;
a hard exterior and soft within!

630
01:34:11,742 --> 01:34:14,370
Why did you run for the mail?
