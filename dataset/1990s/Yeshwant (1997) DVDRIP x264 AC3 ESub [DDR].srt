1
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,270
Thanks to you, sir.

2
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,116
-Here he comes, the beggar!
-I've got the money.

3
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:14,456
-How much.
- Quite a lot.

4
00:04:17,537 --> 00:04:20,131
And who'll pay the rest of it?

5
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:24,807
Look, if you don't pay me
all the money, by God...

6
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:29,144
I'll break your bones!
Remember that!

7
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:30,672
Okay.

8
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:34,482
Don't know where they come from
during business hours! Damn you.

9
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:41,821
Here, and stay away from
the police.Beat it!

10
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:11,580
Come on guys... Hey you!
Think it's free eh?

11
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:16,185
- Get going...go on
-Damn! Let me go!

12
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:20,695
Let go, I say, you old
swine! Bloody beggar...

13
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,529
What's going on? You bloody...

14
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,699
My God! Damn you...

15
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:30,096
You bastard! I'm Yashwant Lohar!

16
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:21,647
- Where's the chilly powder?
-In that red tin.

17
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,478
Okay.

18
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,496
Have you gone to sleep?

19
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:45,666
Don't sleep!

20
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,023
Yes?

21
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,034
Dead for the next 8 hours!

22
00:08:29,055 --> 00:08:31,546
Sit. Careful...

23
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:14,425
- Take care.
-Don't worry about me.

24
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:17,762
Remember the dates.

25
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,765
...all the details.

26
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:43,790
Look into the eyes and talk.
Don't be afraid.

27
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,957
-It's okay, I understand.
-Look into the eyes and talk.

28
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:04,981
What excellent cards! Terriffic!

29
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:11,980
- What have I done?
-Nothing?

30
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,648
No!

31
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:17,488
That's why I'm letting you off
lightly.Else...I want no trouble.

32
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:22,159
Just because I'm an orphan,
just about anyone bullies me!

33
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:27,833
-I don't have parents, see...
-I also don't have parents.

34
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:32,010
I didn't play cards, but became
an inspector. Suspended, but still.

35
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:36,011
My wife's there. She's giving her
I.A.S. exam. She's also an orphan.

36
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:39,840
It's no crime to be one, but it is
a misfortune.Make it your strength.

37
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,682
Don't make noise that
you're an orphan!

38
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:55,594
Hi! At last you're here!
I was waiting for ages.

39
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:59,035
- Get off!
- Only till the next signal.

40
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:02,532
- This will not do!
- Will do, will do.Let's go.

41
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:05,372
- You own this, eh?
-No, you do!

42
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,875
You're a cop. Then where is your
uniform? Tell the truth now.

43
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,712
-Are you a constable or inspector?
- Get off!

44
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:16,719
- Why get offended?
- Off!

45
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,218
He's like a kid!

46
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,559
-So, Pawar?
- Want tea, sir?

47
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,893
-No.How are you?
-Fine.

48
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:33,895
- When will you re-join, sir?
- When the chap up there says so!

49
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,634
When did you start believing in him?
-Not that chap...

50
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:44,081
The chap who sits on my head! If I
shake my head then he'll know...

51
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:47,411
Sir, who ever picks a fight
with you, fights a losing battle!

52
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,245
-All well at home?
- Yes, sir.

53
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,591
How long will you pull on,
on half-pay?

54
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:14,102
My son will join the Academy
and be an offiicer, like you.

55
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,872
-Sign, sir.
-He'll be suspended.

56
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:21,014
His 1/2 pay will shatter your dreams.
You'll suffer in your old age.

57
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,078
- Think again.
-I have, sir.

58
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,962
What are you doing here
in a safari-suit?

59
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:36,463
What do you mean? I'm waiting
for you. Where the hell are you?

60
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:41,300
Then realised it's pay day, eh?
Might get some cash. Shameless!

61
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,812
- What are you looking at?
- You dream of cream like a cat!

62
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:50,146
-2 ice lollies, please.
-Right.

63
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:54,118
You'll give me money?
Can you afford it?

64
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:56,815
What money do you mean?
What money?

65
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,981
I've to give you my case,
plus money? Who are you?

66
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:05,491
-People know you because of me.
-How much you talk!

67
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:13,669
Now listen carefully. The
case is going in your favour.

68
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:18,337
-How do you know?
-My sources. I was told you were here.

69
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:23,839
Now don't do any dramatics!
One error and you'll be in trouble.

70
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:29,744
- They too yearn to provoke you!
-Let them, I'll... To hell with jobs.

71
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:34,857
To hell with you too! Selfish!
Eat one more.It may cool you.

72
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:40,196
Come home tonight. We'll eat
crabs made by my wife for you.

73
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,866
-Booze too!
-Sure.Booze too.

74
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:47,529
- ''Make friends...
- with a blind man...

75
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,698
And then be his guide-dog!

76
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:53,038
-A fag please.
-A fag too, eh?

77
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:56,871
-How much will you eat off me?
-I'm not living off a criminal.

78
00:13:57,116 --> 00:14:01,212
-No, but a criminal lawyer!
- One ice lolly, and you make noise!

79
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,378
-How much?
-Forget it.

80
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,890
You're still on 1/2 pay!
Take the money please.

81
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:21,399
-How much do I owe you?
-I'll just check.

82
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:23,734
Rs. 970/-.

83
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,745
Give an envelop please.
Add the rest, to my credit.

84
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:38,918
So, Shaku, you'll soon
be leaving us, eh?

85
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:43,589
Here, take this. Not much,
but I've toiled for it.

86
00:14:44,597 --> 00:14:48,590
Didn't take any dowry did you?
If any in-law trouble, call me.

87
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:53,030
- Okay then, bye.
-Have a soft-drink,

88
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:54,434
No, thanks.

89
00:14:57,443 --> 00:15:01,106
-How much?
- Why here, sir?

90
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,171
Here, there.It's all the same.
I've to pay you.

91
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,441
-Rs. 500/-.
- 1/2 litre from tomorrow.

92
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,447
At least today, drink only this.
How's your mother?

93
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,075
This is for you, Yashwant.

94
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,253
- What is it?
- Wealth in form of paper.

95
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:29,584
- What shall I do with it?
-Nothing. That's what they want.

96
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,321
This is a reward to
do nothing.

97
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:35,597
- Take it.
- Who sent it?

98
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,930
Narcotics lobby.
They are those...

99
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:48,071
...who don't trouble anybody.
But if anybody troubles them...

100
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,614
...then they don't
spare him.Keep it.

101
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:58,453
-Keep it. We've also to earn.
- You're a pimp in an uniform!

102
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:03,454
Go give it to your wife.
She'll offer it to God, who'll bless.

103
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,127
- What!
-Shall I repeat myself?

104
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,128
If you form enmity with
outsiders we're with you.

105
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,803
But if you form enmity with one
of your kind, you'll repent it!

106
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,635
Go and dig up whatever you wish!

107
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:35,817
- Take off your shoes.
-Do you love me?

108
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:43,328
-Do you love me?
-Need you ask?

109
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,495
- Yes.
- Why?

110
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:50,502
Why do you love a man
who can't give you anything?

111
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,344
Agood house, food,
clothes, jewellery.

112
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,670
-I don't want all this.
-Neither do I.

113
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,816
Then why do people
try to bribe me?

114
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:02,342
- Take your shoes off!
- Why do they try to bribe me?

115
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:05,354
Why? Do they think I can
be bought like them?

116
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:12,020
- Why do they think that?
- Why do get so upset about it?

117
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,355
-It happens.
- Why?

118
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,691
Something wrong with my face?

119
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:21,366
Or do I have a body odour?
But that's natural.

120
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,375
This is not sweat, but blood which
drips as water from my body.

121
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:31,046
-Did you meet anyone again today?
- They can't stand one honest man.

122
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,213
That's because they fear you.
You make them realise...

123
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:41,055
...their pettiness. They want you
to stoop to their level and fall.

124
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,888
So why do you trouble yourself
over it by thinking?

125
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:51,569
You'll have to change yourself.
Don't try to change others.

126
00:19:55,074 --> 00:19:58,908
When will you think
about me, and our home?

127
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,402
About our children
that will come later.

128
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:07,576
We want to give them everything
that we didn't get.Right?

129
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,417
You, your home, and kids...
That's what makes your world.

130
00:20:14,426 --> 00:20:18,692
- You're right.I'm talking bullshit.
- You can't be wrong.

131
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:22,427
I am wrong.I say wrong things.
I think wrongly but bear it with me.

132
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:25,764
If you feel bad, beat me up.
But don't leave me.

133
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:44,613
On the ground floor of Tarapore
Towers, the men you want are hiding.

134
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:49,289
- Is this information authentic?
- 100%! Hurry, else they'll scram

135
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,456
Listen... whose letter is it?

136
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:04,465
- Where's the key?
-It's with the offiicer-in-charge.

137
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:09,970
Go get something.
Get something to break this!

138
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:20,651
Here, wear these.

139
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:26,487
This will protect only this part.
If you're hit here, you're dead!

140
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,160
- Who'll come with me?
- We will.

141
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,963
- What if you die?
-Prepared, sir.

142
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,664
Really?
Govt. will pay you Rs. 25,000/-

143
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:38,666
If you die on duty. Your wife
will get those Rs. 25,000/-.

144
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,039
Kids may beg all their lives.
Will do?

145
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,671
- Yes, sir.
- Good!

146
00:21:43,782 --> 00:21:47,513
If I get killed, don't worry.
Just get them here, or in the head.

147
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,181
Got that? Give me that, will you?

148
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,853
Sorry, uncle.I didn't hit that.

149
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:01,149
Please give me the ball.

150
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:06,598
- What do you want to be when
you grow up?- Tendulkar.

151
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:10,265
Sachin can never be Gavaskar.
Gavaskar can't be Mushtaq Ali.

152
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:14,428
They've their own identity.
Try to do that.

153
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,597
That's fine.
But, my ball please.

154
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,104
My ball please.

155
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,683
Give me my ball.I didn't
hit it.He did.

156
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:34,342
I'm Inspector Yashwant Lohar.
Hands up! Don't move.

157
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:37,282
Kadam, if they try anything...
Shoot!

158
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:08,447
- Will this break our stumps?
- This kills men!

159
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,578
Forget the stumps!

160
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:21,658
Tiger calling control.

161
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:28,897
The 4 wanted criminals are hiding
in Tarapore Garden. There's firing.

162
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,567
Send additional force and
ammunition quickly.

163
00:25:33,745 --> 00:25:39,581
You go there. That man's crazy.
If he shoots those men down...

164
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:43,754
- What will we tell their boss?
-Right, sir, I'll see to it.

165
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:46,489
-I'm sending you the force.
- Over, and out.

166
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:55,934
There's firing in Tarapore Towers.
All men are to go there.

167
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:01,933
Why has the firing stopped?
The back-door is covered.

168
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,603
Haven't gone upstairs, have they?

169
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,788
Cover me.

170
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,953
Go to the opposite building.
Cover me.

171
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:59,828
Close the lift.Don't move.
Shoot anybody who comes down.

172
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:33,024
Police, coming up.

173
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:33,748
This is InspectorJoshi here.
Put down your arms.

174
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:39,260
Surrender yourselves.
I promise you.

175
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:42,097
You'll not be deceived.

176
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,597
Put down your arms.
I promise you.

177
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:52,437
-Nobody will hurt you.
-Let's surrender.

178
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,272
-Shall we tell them?
- Yes.

179
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,439
We'll surrender.

180
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,608
We're ready to surrender.But...

181
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,616
But nobody should fire at us.

182
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,954
Stop firing!

183
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:13,462
- They are surrendering.
-Damn it!

184
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:40,981
That Lohar is still alive.
If he sees us, he'll kill us!

185
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:44,318
- We'll kill him before that.
- Yes, do that!

186
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,337
I'll lose my hold soon.
Please save me.

187
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:07,345
I'll surrender myself.
Look, I'll fall down.

188
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:11,688
What will you do staying alive?
Kill more policemen.

189
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:15,054
-No I won't.
-Rape some girl.

190
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,352
No...

191
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,355
-Again do drug traffiicking.
-No. Save me.

192
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:25,030
I'd have hauled you over, but
my arm is weak. You shot me.

193
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:29,697
That bullet is still in there.
Take your bullet back!

194
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:00,394
Get ready for an inquiry.

195
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:07,177
- Where's Inspector Lohar?
-My 2 constables are serious.

196
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:11,079
-See to them.I'm shot in my arm...
- Other docs are attending to them.

197
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,907
They're not in danger, are they?
Have their families been told?

198
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:30,424
You're taking so long!

199
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:43,279
-Finished?
-I've to put stitches. Don't move.

200
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,947
How many stitches will you put?
Am I a pyjama or something?

201
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:53,050
What are you doing here?
Nothing's wrong with me. Go!

202
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:55,957
Go and console the families
the injured constables.

203
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:59,057
Go! And shut the door!

204
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,805
- Who informed you?
-He's poor, but cannot be bought.

205
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:11,636
- Who is he? His name?
-I won't disclose it.

206
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:15,135
You should have transferred
this information.

207
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:19,639
Neither the case is yours, nor that
area is under your jurisdiction.

208
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,309
Wherever there's crime, that area
comes under my jurisdiction.

209
00:32:24,055 --> 00:32:27,491
If a woman is raped in an area,
shall I keep quiet...

210
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:31,990
-...because that area is not mine?
-If the police have some rights...

211
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:36,327
...they come with some rules too.
You have misused those rights.

212
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,665
They were going to surrender.
Even then you shot them?

213
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:48,510
They killed my 2 men. That's not
murder.If I kill them, it's murder.

214
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:52,180
- You should've brought them to court.
-And what good would that do?

215
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:56,518
Same old story. Some pockets
emptied. Some pockets fiilled.

216
00:32:57,522 --> 00:33:02,186
They'd be released on bail.
Then the F.T.R. would be ready.

217
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:07,195
Then the case will start, it'll
go on and on. Then elections!

218
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,357
The criminal will fight an
election from inside the jail.

219
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:14,198
His hoodlums force the nervous people
to vote, by scaring them more.

220
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,874
The criminal becomes an M.L.A.!
He's happy, and so are you.

221
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,874
- The circle is complete.
-Like some fine art...

222
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:25,876
...nowadays one attains one more
art. The art of idealism!

223
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:32,217
As long as you don't change
your ways, and yourself, I...

224
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:36,223
Neither I, nor my ways will change.
If you wish, change the vow, that...

225
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:40,230
...we take as commissioned offiicers.
Loyalty to the Indian constitution.

226
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:43,056
I'll try my best to protect
the freedom of my country.

227
00:33:43,234 --> 00:33:48,228
Avoid communal disintegration.
Use my constitutional rights...

228
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:51,901
...by being unbiased and honest.
And apart from this...

229
00:33:52,577 --> 00:33:56,240
...India is my country.
Dishonesty is my birthright.

230
00:33:57,415 --> 00:34:01,249
All the corrupt are my brothers.
All the hoodlums here...

231
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:04,755
...the dacoits, the rapists are
my relations. To
serve them,

232
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:09,260
to prosper them is my greatest duty.
All my life I'll be loyal to them.

233
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,773
This Enquiry commission
has its importance too.

234
00:34:30,448 --> 00:34:34,282
Enquiry Commission my foot.
Just say ''We don't need you''.

235
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:37,615
Why this farce?

236
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:41,122
To humiliate,
and break you from within.

237
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:47,629
They may hope that, getting scared
the man may join hands with them.

238
00:34:47,832 --> 00:34:52,292
Let them try anything.And do
you know who's doing this?

239
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,634
A man who has not even passed
his school-leaving certifficate!

240
00:34:56,474 --> 00:34:59,466
Four years back he was a vendor.
Today, he's a corporator!

241
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:09,150
See what he did? And how?

242
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:14,322
He threw a fat morsel to my
colleagues, who pawned their uniforms!

243
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:18,489
And what did they do?
They suspended me!

244
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:23,494
Because the power is on the other
side of the table, where they sit.

245
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:25,659
Not here where I stand.

246
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:30,672
Go! We don't need you.
You're an invalid!

247
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:33,003
That's power.

248
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,904
That's what I say! Why
don't we have this power?

249
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:42,346
Because over there, on that
chair none of us are there.

250
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:50,684
One of us should be there.

251
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:53,354
-How and who?
-Anyone.It could be anybody.

252
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:58,024
It could be you.Even her.

253
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:04,198
Learn more.Become able to occupy
the chair and then play the game.

254
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,366
There must be our
man there. Then play.

255
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:10,541
-I won't study.
- Why not?

256
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:12,876
If you want to become
somebody, you'll study.

257
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,711
-I...
- Yes?

258
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:20,388
-I won't study.
- You'll have to! Why won't you?

259
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:50,307
- What have you done?
- What you'd have, if you were attacked!

260
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,647
- Who is he?
-Must be one of your pimps!

261
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:56,810
Don't talk crap!
Take him away!

262
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:09,989
Get 5 people as witnesses too.

263
00:38:12,503 --> 00:38:14,494
Call an ambulance too.

264
00:38:53,378 --> 00:38:54,868
Useless bum!

265
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:19,736
Bloody bastard! Couldn't
even do a small job!

266
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:24,238
Good thing you bumped him off
like a street dog!

267
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,752
It's so very sad! But what
can one do with fate?

268
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:42,257
We've to shed tears no doubt.
But one has to live too.

269
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:46,592
Don't think you're all alone.
I'm there for you. Okay?

270
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:53,097
He was my boy from my ward.
His sacriffice will not go waste.

271
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:56,599
I'm very ashamed that a fellow
police offiicer did this.

272
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:01,434
Take it easy. You're so young yet.

273
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,445
You have a full life ahead.
But, it's all God's will.

274
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:11,786
He took him away.Never mind...

275
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,624
Everything will be fine. Your tears
will dry in a few days.

276
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:21,789
Don't feel lonely.I'm
always there for you.

277
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,458
Sit down now.

278
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:40,645
- Come on, Salim, surely not here?
- What can I do?

279
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:45,311
He was my man.
So she becomes mine too.

280
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,982
One has to take care of
one's possessions, isn't it?

281
00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:53,494
Do you think what you
did was correct?

282
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:54,620
Yes.

283
00:40:54,732 --> 00:40:58,998
What is your opinion about
the pact we signed in 1972...

284
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,665
...with our neighbouring country?
Does it still carry any weight?

285
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:06,170
Yes, very much. In fact, on the
strength of its compromises...

286
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:08,335
...the relations between
the two can improve.

287
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:10,843
Then where's the hitch?!

288
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:15,509
Here, and there too! Both, nations,
in a race to down trod the other...

289
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,519
...forgot, that because of
this attitude of theirs...

290
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:23,183
...the whole of S.Asia, is at
a great loss. I'll further say...

291
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:25,685
...if they want to avoid
self destruction,...

292
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:28,188
...the Simla Accord
is the only answer.

293
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:33,027
- What about Women's Liberation.
-Imported variety cannot work here.

294
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:35,698
-Did you come by train or plane?
- Train.

295
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,370
What was your bogie No.?

296
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:44,046
If I invite you out
to dinner tonight...

297
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:47,882
-...will your husband mind?
-He's like a son-in-law to you...

298
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,050
...so no question of him minding.

299
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:54,889
What was the no. of your bogie?

300
00:41:56,594 --> 00:42:01,725
- You just said it was 527943
-Stupid questions get stupid answers.

301
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:08,731
- When will your wife return?
-In a couple of days.

302
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:12,065
-She'll be very sad.
- Yes, especially if I had died!

303
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:17,740
- What nonsense you blabber!
- You too think I talk nonsense, eh?

304
00:42:20,346 --> 00:42:22,405
- Why have you come here?
- To hear your nonsense!

305
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:28,410
You were to rejoin tomorrow.
But you ended up with this trouble!

306
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:34,253
-How long shall I fight your cases?
-Had he killed me, you'd be free.

307
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:38,088
- Then you should've got him jailed.
-It was either him, or me!

308
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,096
It's a plot, I tell you.
The whole force is corrupted.

309
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,097
- You're also a part of it.
-And see what's happening!

310
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,512
- They are after my blood!
-It's a question of their survival.

311
00:42:55,281 --> 00:43:00,446
A constable with 3 marriageable
daughters. How will he live on 1800/-?

312
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:06,451
He has just a stick as defence.
How will he take on a AK47?

313
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,952
He's not sure whether he'll return
home when he sets out on duty.

314
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,459
What compensation does he get
if he dies on duty?

315
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:16,463
25,000/- to 30,000/-?

316
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:20,800
-He too wants to live.
-So to do that, he'll take bribes...

317
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:26,138
...sell his integrity! Didn't he know
his pay when he joined the force?

318
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,484
This is like law of the jungle!
To avoid gangsters, go to the police.

319
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,981
To avoid police go to gangsters
To avoid both, go to politicians!

320
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,323
Because they all control each other.
He does as per the circumstances.

321
00:43:45,398 --> 00:43:48,333
You've made foes in all the three.
No door is open to you!

322
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,159
What door?

323
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:53,672
They want to kill me in my own
house! Which door do you mean?

324
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,172
The gangsters', the corrupt offiicers,
or the damn politicians, who...

325
00:43:57,243 --> 00:44:00,838
-...in broad daylight drink blood!
- Then rot here!

326
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,680
You invite trouble and then
dream of peace!

327
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,511
Sure.
If I die, how will it affect you?

328
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,847
You'll just miss a shoulder,
for your bier!

329
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:16,689
You preach me dishonesty, eh?

330
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,187
And you're a lawyer!

331
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:23,358
Did you read law, or did you
cheat and pass? Go and read.

332
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,195
Go and read all this.

333
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:36,871
Nobody can touch me! Now go!
Go! Else I'll kill you too.

334
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,716
Okay, kill me.But sign here first.

335
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,712
I don't have time!

336
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,390
Here! Sign down here.
You're like a dog's tail.

337
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:55,565
-Nothing can straighten it!
- Get lost! Give me a fag!

338
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,563
You won't improve will you?
It's impossible!

339
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:17,579
Can't you do such a small thing?
Why do I stuff you with money?

340
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:23,923
-Is he not in jail for murder now?
- Yes, but he should remain there.

341
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,424
- Get me?
- Trust me, sir.

342
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,260
He'll never breathe fresh air again.

343
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,270
Yashwant's lawyer is trying to
bail him out, and he may get it.

344
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:44,443
If this happens, I'll see
that you coffin is lowered!

345
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:58,286
The moment that man fell,
InspectorJoshi entered.

346
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,964
Then police came, and took me away.

347
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,294
Joshi was still upstairs.
When I left, that man a alive.

348
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,965
He was declared dead, later.
I didn't kill him.It's a plot.

349
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:13,470
-Now what?
-Bit complicated.

350
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,805
But I won't let him be sentenced.
-Don't talk shit!

351
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,479
Obliging me, eh?
Won't let me be punished...

352
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,813
-I'll go now.
-Eat with us.

353
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:27,916
No, I've to prepare things.

354
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,003
What is it? There's no case.
I'll be acquitted.

355
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:50,509
Look you're no ordinary woman.
You're a Deputy-Collector, okay?

356
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:12,193
My name is Salim Sheikh.
I'm a corporator.

357
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,205
I'm been friends with all the
Deputy-collectors posted here.

358
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:20,372
-So I thought I'd meet you too...
- What's your problem?

359
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:26,711
That all can be seen to later.
First, if I get to know you well.

360
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:31,546
-Just tell me your problem.
- You're offended.

361
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,054
We'll talk shop.My fiile is with you.

362
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,386
The name and number is...

363
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:47,061
You just sign it, and send it
to Mr.Kale.I'll be obliged.

364
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:51,240
I've seen that fiile.No hotel
can be built on that land.

365
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,070
What's the problem?Just think.
If a hotel is built...

366
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,741
...we'll be serving people like you
The nation will get foreign exchange.

367
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,585
There'll be rise in drug-pedalling,
smuggling, prostitution.

368
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:10,425
You'll have gambling-dens, and
thousands of fishermen will starve.

369
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,755
Under the name of foreign exchange
and tourism you'll prove patriotism.

370
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,267
-But you can go now.
- You forget the service I speak of.

371
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:25,440
And also that it takes years to
be promoted as a Collector!

372
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:31,113
If you have the right contacts
and the right helping hands...

373
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,641
...then this promotion
can be got very easily.

374
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,614
And that contact and those hands
are right before you.Believe me...

375
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,621
I'll serve you with all
my heart body and soul.

376
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,289
Take your heart, body
and soul elsewhere.

377
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,458
This is my offiice, not your den!

378
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:57,975
You're the power of this chair...

379
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,646
-... or shall I get you thrown out?
-I'm going...

380
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:05,479
But we'll meet again. God keep you.

381
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:15,825
She sounds like Yashwant.

382
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,324
What's wrong?

383
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,999
Where are you?
You're not with me.

384
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,335
You must've had a bad
first day at offiice.

385
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,508
Someone must've tried to bribe you.
Or some minister's note on table.

386
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:45,179
Somebody must have
ogled at you lustily.

387
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,518
This is common in
a government offiice.

388
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,189
But you'll have to work there.

389
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,938
Keep your hand on my head.

390
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,379
Keep your hand on my head.

391
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,879
Now say I Ragini Lohar
will be honest in my work.

392
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,398
I'll use my powers for the
good of the people.

393
00:50:32,137 --> 00:50:34,230
I'll never allow injustice
be done to an innocent.

394
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,404
My aim will be to improve the life
of the poor and the backward.

395
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,573
I'll never take any decision
under anybody's pressure.

396
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,914
Even if he is, my husband.

397
00:51:06,004 --> 00:51:11,772
Inspector Lohar has 2 major
faults. His uncontrolled temper...

398
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:16,276
...and his habit to take bribes.
To lift his hands on others...

399
00:51:16,348 --> 00:51:22,287
...is a habit with him.But,
he's also a very capable offiicer.

400
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:27,784
I sympathise with him greatly.
But when I reached there that day...

401
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,626
...I saw Lohar was beating
the man mercilessly.

402
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,130
I tried to intervene, but
Lohar didn't heed me.

403
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,625
He strangled the man and killed him.

404
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:44,798
You can step down now.

405
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,639
The picture is quite clear.

406
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:57,145
Besides being a government offiicer,
Lohar is also the husband of...

407
00:51:57,222 --> 00:52:02,319
...our deputy collector.
He didn't even bother to think...

408
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:07,322
...that his actions could have
mar his wife's reputation...

409
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:12,827
-...and also hinder her work.
-If I'm a hindrance to my wife...

410
00:52:12,971 --> 00:52:17,499
...if I'm marring her reputation,
I'm willing to divorce her right now!

411
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,008
My lawyer-friend here, will do
all that is legally needful.

412
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,005
Are you mad? This is no time
to talk nonsense.

413
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,677
Enough! Enough, I say!

414
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:38,018
- Why blame her?
-I'm not, ...

415
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:40,690
...but I've become
a hindrance to her.

416
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,358
-Have you gone crazy?
- Why do we marry?

417
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:48,029
To understand, each other, share
our joys and sorrows... enough!

418
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,698
...or to be a burden to each other?

419
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:02,380
- Get my divorce papers ready...
-Listen Yashwant...

420
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:09,388
-But I...
-But what? What is marriage?

421
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,888
What, is marriage? Tell me.

422
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,393
Ornaments? Good clothes?
A house? A car?

423
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:24,072
Luxurious life? She'll cook
for me, Bear me children.

424
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:29,407
What is sex? Ten minutes
we sleep together...

425
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,240
...the rest of the 24 hours,
we should respect each other.

426
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:38,420
We both should do something
that makes us proud of each other.

427
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:44,089
This court, as per the I.P.C.
sentences Yashwant Lohar...

428
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,759
...to 10 years of rigorous
imprisonment.

429
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,261
Take him away!

430
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,609
Why did you do that? You left me?

431
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,613
You gave me a divorce?
Made me a homeless? Why?

432
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,441
- What did I do?
-Nothing.

433
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,784
This separation is a facade.

434
00:54:11,189 --> 00:54:14,625
Nobody can say now that my actions
cause you embarrassment.

435
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:18,957
Do your work.Nothing must
come in its way.Keep fighting.

436
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,463
Neither I'll lose, nor will you
get defeated! I will...

437
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,798
I'll always be with you.
A divorce cannot separate us.

438
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:43,310
This is, ''digging one's own grave''.
Got a long sentence.

439
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,484
Now he'll know! Lost his wife too!

440
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,655
Where will she go? I'll have
to make up for his absence.

441
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,001
Welcome, sir.I'm very
happy to see you here.

442
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:07,344
We're all one now. Same food,
clothes and under one roof too!

443
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,512
Now we're not different from you.

444
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,185
See this. This has
honesty and integrity.

445
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,853
My sweat too.

446
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,695
And this blood here...
is not your own.

447
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:38,537
It is sucked from those
poor, innocent souls.

448
00:55:39,678 --> 00:55:43,705
You suck theirs for your own gains.
And I drink yours for their sake.

449
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,048
That's the difference
between you and I.

450
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:52,546
You can't sleep because you fear
death, while I sleep like a log.

451
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:57,718
That's the difference between us.
Your mother's heads hangs in shame.

452
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:02,056
My mother, if she comes to know,
will hold her head sky high.

453
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,057
That's where we differ!

454
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,897
I know I'm selling mirrors in
the city of the blind, but one day.

455
00:56:09,975 --> 00:56:13,570
...I'll open your eyes and show
you your faces in those mirrors.

456
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,904
Understand? That's the difference!

457
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:24,755
I've to wait for so long
in this damn offiice?

458
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:29,917
-Has she forgotten?
-But sir...

459
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,922
What is it? It's half hour
and you didn't call me in.

460
00:56:36,168 --> 00:56:39,433
You can see I'm talking to this
man. Wait outside, I'll call you.

461
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,771
Oh I see I thought you forgot me.

462
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:48,436
How can I forget you?
Well, carry on.

463
00:56:48,747 --> 00:56:53,446
I live in a rented place with
my family for 15 years now.

464
00:56:53,819 --> 00:56:58,449
But today my landlord is
threatening to kill me.

465
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,282
Because he wants to build a
factory on it illegally.

466
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:06,791
I've sent many applications
about it, but one clerk here...

467
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,623
...is demanding 500/- to
send the fiile ahead.

468
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:14,966
Rs. 500/-? Come with me.

469
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:27,649
Where are you going? You
really made me wait today.

470
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,314
If you, sign that fiile...

471
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:35,826
-...with your beautiful hands, then...
- You were always mannerless...

472
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:42,661
...but you're shameless even more.
I've told you before, I'll not sign.

473
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:47,328
- Can't you understand?
-I'll take care of Mr.Kale.

474
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,598
And your commission too!

475
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,038
Good evening, Madam.

476
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,376
- What's this?
-Mr.Kale sent it to you.

477
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,051
- You?
-Is your father home?

478
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:47,058
Come in please.

479
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,558
Welcome, Ms. Lohar.

480
00:58:57,876 --> 00:59:01,073
- What impertinence is this?
- You should know.

481
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,072
You've sold yourself, you try
to pull me in too?

482
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,743
- You should be ashamed!
- Talk properly.I'm your senior.

483
00:59:10,055 --> 00:59:13,252
Apet dog is better than a
senior like you.He'll starve...

484
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:18,262
...but he'll never eat from other
homes. You're dancing to the tune...

485
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:21,094
...of such a man, who can't even
put his thumb at the proper place.

486
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,930
-I'll suspend you!
- What else can you do.

487
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:30,936
If this is what you wanted, why
why did you study till the I.A.S.?

488
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:35,777
So that you could barter the rights
given to you by the Constitution?

489
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,944
You're insulting me in my house?
This may have adverse effects.

490
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,053
Do you know the difference
between good and bad?

491
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:47,289
Uprooting thousands of poor homes
you want to fiill your own.

492
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:52,123
This carpet, T.V.. video, furniture...
Imported Cars...

493
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:57,131
You think such things make a home?
Look! Look at these kids.

494
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,303
They make a house, a home.
What do you think?

495
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:06,800
You're making them happy? That they
can't live without these things?

496
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,142
Which you're collecting by selling
your loyalty? Have they harmed you?

497
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,313
By making them morally invalid,
you're being a foe to your own kids!

498
01:00:15,553 --> 01:00:20,149
Ask them what they want?
this dishonest, luxurious life...

499
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,649
...or an honest father!

500
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,837
- Why are you standing around? Go!
- What she said was correct.

501
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:40,509
What! What did you say?

502
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:45,680
You're collecting all this money
for us. We'll live without it.

503
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,175
We'll work hard, and earn our living.

504
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,686
We love you very much.

505
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,524
We wish to respect
you all our lives.

506
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:00,525
If you get caught...No!
We don't want any of this.

507
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:04,359
- Then, what do you want?
-An honest father!

508
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:10,702
What? Sir, that girl
refused the money.

509
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,536
Damn him!

510
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,045
She's one in a hundred!

511
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:35,397
A small mosquito, can
make a man impotent.

512
01:01:37,502 --> 01:01:43,065
One bed-bug can paralyse him!
Small things make man powerless.

513
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:49,406
Be a speck in the crowd at morn, and
get drunk and sire kids at night.

514
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:55,247
And then die again at dawn; Cos,
the soul and the man within is dead.

515
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:01,259
He has compromised with life.
A small thing, makes man powerless.

516
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:45,628
Bland food, coarse
clothes and silverware...

517
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,962
80 out of 100 are dishonest
yet my country is great!

518
01:02:57,582 --> 01:03:01,643
The insect in a white cap,
declares, equality among people.

519
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,481
Is that why the big fish
is swallowing the small fries?

520
01:03:06,057 --> 01:03:10,153
The curs that we elect, bite us,
to distribute our chunks between them!

521
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:13,828
The empty streets shudder at their
voices full of inhuman stink!

522
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,157
Babes born yesterday pant after
their first breath!

523
01:03:19,737 --> 01:03:22,501
These bastards of the devil are
creating chaos! And we...

524
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:27,668
We the god-fearing beasts,
have made life, a 4-letter word!

525
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:31,345
What will the damn man do?
An insect has made him powerless!

526
01:03:57,642 --> 01:04:01,373
Fall! Fall, you damned lot,...
but fall like that waterfall...

527
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:05,376
...which doesn't lose its hearty,
even after falling from a mountain.

528
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:09,050
And doesn't lose its after
falling low to the ground.

529
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:15,223
But who has the time to think?
Cos an insect, makes man impotent.

530
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,907
The war between Mandir-Masjid
left thousands dead...

531
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,910
Thousands more were sacrifficed
under pretence of duty and help.

532
01:04:45,156 --> 01:04:49,092
He who killed King Bali and threw
Ravana in the jaws of death...

533
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:53,591
Erased sin with virtue...I seek
that Rama! But it seems...

534
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:57,428
...the Rama of modern times, has
an unending exile.No wonder.

535
01:04:57,635 --> 01:05:00,763
For, one insect, makes man powerless!

536
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:22,456
Some time later, the devils will
come. They'll knock on my door.

537
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:28,126
They'll investigate my
burning and get fired up.

538
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:33,467
At that time, I'll not get scared.

539
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,974
I'll use my faith as a shield, and
the fire within me as a sword.

540
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:44,471
One of these days you'll jump
into that fire, for sure.

541
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:49,646
Abuse me today, sell me.
But what do I have to sell?

542
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,483
Just consolation of
my hot tears. But!

543
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:58,326
But I'll have my revenge! The
pause between my 2 last breaths...

544
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,987
...I'll give you free... free!

545
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:08,336
Sir... You have a visitor.

546
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:14,668
Don't salute me.Kick me.Right here.

547
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,838
Kick me.

548
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,342
I'm a prisoner.

549
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,680
Aprisoner of these insects!

550
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:50,370
I had forbidden you.
Why have you come?

551
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,388
To cry? To shed tears?

552
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:08,897
I can't bear it anymore.I won't
be able to go on with life.

553
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:14,235
I just want to live as your wife.

554
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:22,069
I want only you.Not this job.

555
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:28,408
The kinds of people...
Their way of talking.

556
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:34,588
Their lusty looks rip through
the clothes...

557
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:36,650
...and touch my body.

558
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,588
This rape by their eyes...

559
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,098
...I've to bear every day.

560
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:53,771
Not just once, but many times.
I feel as though...

561
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,603
...I'm standing naked in the bazaar.

562
01:07:59,851 --> 01:08:01,842
I feel suffocated.

563
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,118
They should feel throttled
because of you!

564
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,792
They should've tears in their eyes.

565
01:08:13,698 --> 01:08:15,689
If that's not happening
it's due to your weakness.

566
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,965
They'll not revere you, nor
stop eyeing you lustily.

567
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:26,307
The world is full of such lot.
What had I told you?

568
01:08:27,912 --> 01:08:32,315
Look in their eyes and talk.
Build such a fire within you...

569
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:38,315
...that it reflects from your eyes
and makes them lower their own!

570
01:08:39,557 --> 01:08:43,653
You vowed.If you break it, then
whether I'm here or not, is same.

571
01:08:45,062 --> 01:08:47,053
I cannot accept a weak wife.

572
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,657
Your weakness is their victory.

573
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,671
You'll have to fight.
There's no other go.

574
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:00,600
What if they have an illegal power?

575
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,035
I do love you.

576
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:39,039
Love you very much.

577
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,709
And I always will as long
as you'll confront this.

578
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:47,884
Your name is Ragini Yashwant Lohar.

579
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:54,225
Instead of coming whining in here
again, better you consume poison!

580
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:01,895
I'll console myself that you just
weren't capable of bearing this load.

581
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,094
- What's going on?
-I'll just see.

582
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:32,759
What for?Just sit tight.

583
01:10:37,341 --> 01:10:39,775
This is an every day farce.
To hell with them!

584
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,453
I'll set the bastard straight!

585
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,292
Hey you! Look what's going on.

586
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,633
Those bastards are after that
lone woman to rape her.

587
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,303
You bloody hooligans!

588
01:11:17,615 --> 01:11:19,606
Wait!Just you wait! I'll show you.

589
01:11:21,252 --> 01:11:26,155
You bastards. Come on...
I'll castrate you! Bloody men!

590
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,819
Bloody pimps!

591
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,166
Don't you have any sense?
Why are you out alone at night?

592
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,164
How did your husband allow
you out alone at night?

593
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,833
Come on now.Don't be scared.

594
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:52,174
You eunuchs! Why do you sit
inside and blow that horn?

595
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:57,852
Those bastards made you shit eh?
Couldn't shout even! Blows his horn.

596
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,851
-Is that you, sir?
- Yes, go on.

597
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:10,859
I'm Joshi speaking.
That Salim Sheikh...

598
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:16,204
He,...Mrs. Lohar who is
a deputy-collector...

599
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:21,042
Sheikh got his goons to attack her.

600
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:26,539
Make him understand.Is he mad?
This is not done in politics.

601
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:32,216
Not with violence.
That too on a woman? No...

602
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,390
The whole collectorate is
abuzz with this news.

603
01:12:36,694 --> 01:12:39,720
- Get her security.
-I already have.

604
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:45,558
I've chosen an offiicer too.
They were together in college.

605
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:50,397
-His name?
-John Frank. College?

606
01:12:51,642 --> 01:12:55,078
Right ho.
I'll do the confiirmation today.

607
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:58,908
Alright then.

608
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,865
Nothing...go.Later, may be.

609
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,111
May I come in?

610
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,361
You! Here? Where were
you all these days?

611
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:55,965
Come in. Sit down.

612
01:13:58,309 --> 01:13:59,469
Sit down.

613
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:07,978
I've been assigned as your security
I'll investigate and arrange things.

614
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:14,313
In college you were very English.
You feared nothing, but Hindi!

615
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:19,489
And now, your Hindi...
It's unbelievable.

616
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,160
All those big, formal words...

617
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,492
Can't help it. This government
job is like that.Anyway you...

618
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:35,168
What will you have? Tea?
It's coffee without sugar!

619
01:14:37,681 --> 01:14:39,672
Coffee, But bring sugar
and milk separately.

620
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,015
It's so nice to meet you again.

621
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:51,017
You haven't changed a bit.
You still can't.

622
01:14:54,265 --> 01:14:57,029
Grow your moustaches longer.
You'll look a real policeman!

623
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,439
- Why are your hands so cold?
-Just like that?

624
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:08,701
-Are you married?
-I've to give a ''tipni''...

625
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:17,047
-I mean a...
- The same.

626
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:20,717
These windows will have to be shut.

627
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,051
That's it. They'll have to be shut!

628
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,398
I'll always owe you
one thing all my life.

629
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,233
I don't understand.

630
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,240
You had once paid my college-fees
and not told me about it.

631
01:15:49,753 --> 01:15:52,415
If you hadn't done that I
might not have given that exam.

632
01:15:57,428 --> 01:15:59,419
I can repay the money even today.

633
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:04,591
But that particular time...Never!

634
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,768
...I'm insulting you.

635
01:16:23,687 --> 01:16:25,678
I haven't forgotten anything.

636
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,116
Neither have I, Ragini.

637
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:36,126
Yes, keep it.

638
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,469
Your share of sugar in my cup too.

639
01:16:44,541 --> 01:16:47,305
And this is yours, without
sugar, as usual.

640
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:53,146
How could you do this, sir?
You gave her government security?

641
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,809
She, who insulted me, by slapping
me in front of the staff?

642
01:16:57,021 --> 01:16:59,649
Forget it.

643
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:04,321
...you play your game, your way.
I play it, my way, Right?

644
01:17:05,896 --> 01:17:10,993
If you ha any sense, you'd have
forgotten it by now. That's politics.

645
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:15,171
- Understand?
-But sir...This is like opposing me.

646
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:19,836
What can I do to her now?
since you've shown her support?

647
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:23,340
If you want to win the opposition,
then first, honour them.

648
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:28,184
Felicitate them.Everybody likes
to be honoured.Isn't that so?

649
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,853
You want to take revenge, right?
There are many ways to take it.

650
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:37,856
And she being a woman, will always
be aware of her reputation.Mar it!

651
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:43,189
Right,Joshi? What will you
gain by harming her physically?

652
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:47,865
- That too a beautiful body?
- Great! What a move, sir!

653
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:51,039
That's why I'm occupying
this chair.Now get going.

654
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:56,039
But forget that I told you anything.
- What about, sir?

655
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,717
Mr. Sheikh, why all this
razzle-dazzle?

656
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:18,567
The one who slapped you, insulted
me in my own house, is...

657
01:18:18,802 --> 01:18:22,397
You haven't caught-on yet.
It's a political rule.

658
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:27,402
If you want to win the opposition,
then honour and felicitate them.

659
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:30,069
Everybody hungers after honour.

660
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:37,084
You're doing good work. You've
given the administration a face lift.

661
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:42,419
-I'm just doing my duty.
- Come, have something.

662
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:44,925
You too.

663
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,931
What are you doing there? Come here.

664
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:36,309
What lovely photographs. What poses!

665
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,983
You're in a hurry, aren't you?
Well, it's this way.

666
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:52,319
The society honours your post,
not you. So what is your duty?

667
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:57,160
To upkeep the respect and
the status of that post.Right?

668
01:19:57,935 --> 01:20:01,666
And you... with your bodyguard?
If you do that...

669
01:20:01,738 --> 01:20:07,176
...the govt. will fall in the eyes
of the public. What if I pose like...

670
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,506
- What are you doing?
-I was just explaining it to you.

671
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:14,344
In such a situation, anyone
would run away. Get it?

672
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:21,017
Look.I wanted to give you
one more chance, so I gave it.

673
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:26,857
If tomorrow you have any problem,
I'm always here for you.

674
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:29,688
You may go now.

675
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,371
The government lawyer has
tried to prove, that...

676
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:51,377
the deceased had gone to Lohar
to give him a bribe.

677
01:20:51,655 --> 01:20:56,058
But Lohar demanded more
money and because of this...

678
01:20:56,126 --> 01:21:00,722
...there was a tension between
them and exchange of blows.

679
01:21:01,398 --> 01:21:05,061
And in a ffit of rage, Lohar,
with his own knife...

680
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:08,401
...murdered the deceased.But!

681
01:21:08,805 --> 01:21:13,902
With all the statements given,
and presented proofs...

682
01:21:14,344 --> 01:21:17,575
...and after considering
the conditions therein...

683
01:21:17,814 --> 01:21:22,080
...this Court has come to
this decision, that Lohar...

684
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:25,418
...cannot be proved guilty of murder!

685
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:30,758
Thus, this Court finds the
accused Yashwant Lohar...

686
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:35,759
...not guilty with the
right of private defence.

687
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:40,769
Sir, he's free... acquitted!

688
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:46,106
-I've lost my sleep now.
- You'll never complete your sleep!

689
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,272
Go sleep.
We make laws, yes!

690
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,441
But we can't take them
in our own hands.

691
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,941
He's acquitted from this court.
Is this the only court around?

692
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:59,945
There are so many.
Go now. We'll do the needful.

693
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,181
I hope so, sir.

694
01:22:02,626 --> 01:22:06,289
I'm very scared.He's a nut.
He may do anything.

695
01:22:06,597 --> 01:22:11,796
-I know.Do you play chess?
-No.

696
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:16,804
I do.Let him make the 1st move.
We'll reciprocate to that.

697
01:22:26,778 --> 01:22:29,269
-Madam?
- Yes?

698
01:22:30,615 --> 01:22:33,607
Actually...I wanted to speak to you.

699
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:36,610
Can't you think of anything
else, but your duty?

700
01:22:38,357 --> 01:22:40,951
And what's this ''Madam''...
Can't you call me just Ragini?

701
01:22:46,298 --> 01:22:49,790
-Madam...
-Again? Okay, what is it?

702
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,993
''I'm really in a fiix.I don't
know how to tell you this.''

703
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:22,656
You're like fragrance...
How do I trap you?

704
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:08,702
How petty some people are!

705
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:12,227
They can think of
nothing, but body.

706
01:27:12,897 --> 01:27:14,387
Even the animals are better.

707
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:17,390
When will they realise that under
this body, lies a heart too!

708
01:27:42,594 --> 01:27:44,585
Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you.

709
01:27:46,598 --> 01:27:51,194
When I came here, you said, we were
all alike.But now, we differ here.

710
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:55,001
Today I'm acquitted, with
my rank and dignity, intact.

711
01:27:55,774 --> 01:27:58,607
I know sir. Those who love you
must be awaiting you outside.

712
01:27:59,444 --> 01:28:01,776
They'll be very happy to see you free.

713
01:28:06,951 --> 01:28:09,283
-How far will you come with me?
- Till outside.

714
01:28:09,454 --> 01:28:11,945
Limit ends here.
You take care within,...

715
01:28:12,023 --> 01:28:14,958
I'll take care outside.
That's my domain.

716
01:28:58,837 --> 01:29:01,829
-I'm Inspector Lohar.
- To O.T.

717
01:29:02,006 --> 01:29:03,598
I want this man's statement.

718
01:29:03,842 --> 01:29:07,334
-He's critical, I can't
let you take any statement.

719
01:29:07,412 --> 01:29:10,677
Try to get him round.
I must take his statement.

720
01:29:12,851 --> 01:29:13,681
I'll leave my number with you.

721
01:29:16,421 --> 01:29:18,514
- This is Dr. Godbole.
Yes Dr.?

722
01:29:18,857 --> 01:29:20,017
That boy has survived.

723
01:29:20,358 --> 01:29:24,021
- What! He survived?
-And give Yashwant a statement.

724
01:29:24,362 --> 01:29:26,353
Really? He will, eh?

725
01:29:29,367 --> 01:29:33,701
See? That boy will give a statement
to the cop! Think it over.

726
01:30:11,075 --> 01:30:13,066
Who killed him?

727
01:30:28,092 --> 01:30:30,583
Tell me! Who were
waiting for me outside?

728
01:30:34,098 --> 01:30:37,090
Who were they? Who?

729
01:30:44,943 --> 01:30:48,435
Who were they? Tell me.

730
01:30:52,784 --> 01:30:58,620
Don't take law in your hands.
Come on.

731
01:31:50,508 --> 01:31:53,841
Where had you been? You
made me wait for so long.

732
01:31:55,346 --> 01:31:57,337
I awaited you for so long now.

733
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:03,181
Why had you separated from me?
Now I won't go away from you.

734
01:32:04,689 --> 01:32:06,680
No, I won't go!

735
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,859
What's wrong?

736
01:32:50,568 --> 01:32:55,232
That Deshmukh -master's daughter
because a widow today.

737
01:32:59,744 --> 01:33:02,907
Her husband was killed
by some gangsters.

738
01:33:07,418 --> 01:33:09,249
His bullet-riddled body...

739
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:14,081
...is lying in the hospital.

740
01:33:18,763 --> 01:33:20,754
Why was he killed?

741
01:33:23,267 --> 01:33:26,759
Because he saw the people
who riddled bullets at me.

742
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,441
They killed him...

743
01:33:37,949 --> 01:33:40,782
Play with my body...go on.

744
01:33:41,285 --> 01:33:44,880
This is yours. I'm not with you.

745
01:33:47,959 --> 01:33:53,454
You can joy with me
for another 1/2 hour.

746
01:33:56,134 --> 01:33:58,625
After 1/2 hour I've to go back.

747
01:34:00,471 --> 01:34:02,632
I've to claim his body,
and get it cremated.

748
01:34:10,314 --> 01:34:15,149
This is yours. Carry on.
This estate belongs to you!

749
01:34:18,823 --> 01:34:24,318
I can understand your hunger.

750
01:34:25,329 --> 01:34:26,728
Hunger for my body.

751
01:34:26,798 --> 01:34:30,325
We get hungry for food...
We hunger for flesh too.

752
01:34:33,004 --> 01:34:36,167
It's not easy to control
this hunger for 6 months.

753
01:34:37,341 --> 01:34:39,332
But I'm not myself.My...

754
01:34:41,846 --> 01:34:46,180
My senses are elsewhere.
In the hospital.

755
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:58,185
Do what you want to...
But I can't do anything.

756
01:34:59,363 --> 01:35:02,025
Because I see before me...

757
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,863
...that young widow and their kid.

758
01:35:36,067 --> 01:35:39,059
Come on in. Sit down.

759
01:35:43,007 --> 01:35:43,996
I'll pour, sir.

760
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,572
-Be comfortable.
-I am, sir.

761
01:35:54,252 --> 01:35:59,087
Lean back.Be at ease.
One must relax at times.

762
01:36:01,759 --> 01:36:05,422
I'm retiring in November.
Just 6 months from now.

763
01:36:06,764 --> 01:36:10,598
- You could get an extension.
-No.I don't feel like it.

764
01:36:12,937 --> 01:36:15,098
And some people are waiting
for me to retire anyway!

765
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:18,932
In fact they're even trying
I don't get an extension.

766
01:36:20,111 --> 01:36:21,203
Thank you.
You, sir?

767
01:36:25,116 --> 01:36:26,947
I'm sending you to the
Anti-Narcotics Lobby.

768
01:36:29,187 --> 01:36:33,624
I'll do what I can.But
even the C.M.'s involved.

769
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:38,289
I know. Go ahead and expose him.

770
01:36:39,463 --> 01:36:43,797
Bare him in public. We'll see.
But remember, within 6 months.

771
01:36:44,969 --> 01:36:46,960
After November, I won't be
able to do anything for you.

772
01:36:53,477 --> 01:36:55,468
- Good you came.
- Why?

773
01:36:55,546 --> 01:36:57,639
- Give us a tenner, please.
-Begging are you?

774
01:36:57,815 --> 01:36:59,976
-No, just borrowing.
- What for?

775
01:37:00,484 --> 01:37:04,318
- To eat.I haven't eaten anything.
- Can't your pop feed you?

776
01:37:04,755 --> 01:37:08,486
He got paid yesterday, but he lost
it at cards. Drank hooch on credit.

777
01:37:08,693 --> 01:37:11,821
He beat my mom black and blue.
Then he went for me.

778
01:37:11,996 --> 01:37:14,829
I just turned and ran...
Please give me.

779
01:37:16,667 --> 01:37:20,660
- Where is this den and who owns it?
- That Shetty will you play too?

780
01:37:20,972 --> 01:37:22,963
Get lost. Go home.

781
01:37:34,018 --> 01:37:36,009
Sir, sir.Lohar is here.

782
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:43,186
-Listen to me, sir.
-Scram, you...

783
01:37:44,528 --> 01:37:46,189
Here. That's 5 thousand.Now deal.

784
01:37:46,864 --> 01:37:50,425
- What's this, sir?
-Money. Can't you see? Deal, I say.

785
01:37:50,668 --> 01:37:54,695
-I know, but...
-But? What?

786
01:37:54,872 --> 01:37:56,863
You bleed them white, don't you.

787
01:37:56,941 --> 01:38:00,206
And these shameless, give
then daily earnings to you.

788
01:38:01,212 --> 01:38:05,376
They lose cash and booze on credit.
Then go home and beat up wives!

789
01:38:05,483 --> 01:38:10,045
Kids beg on streets. A butcher's
better.He kills a goat...

790
01:38:10,121 --> 01:38:13,716
...and sells openly. Come on,
deal! No.7.Now deal.

791
01:38:15,092 --> 01:38:17,560
They come daily hoping that
they'll win today, tomorrow...

792
01:38:17,628 --> 01:38:21,724
...else the day after. They lose
daily and you're always the winner.

793
01:38:22,566 --> 01:38:27,401
One sided gamble.Not good.
Look at this gamble.A real gun.

794
01:38:30,574 --> 01:38:32,565
5 bullets inside, one outside.

795
01:38:32,643 --> 01:38:39,378
Go on try your luck.All is
yours. Win or service.

796
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:41,748
-I'll even stake my clothes.
-Spare me.

797
01:38:41,986 --> 01:38:46,923
Spare me, eh! I'll try my luck first.
If I survive, I'll take everything.

798
01:38:48,259 --> 01:38:52,423
This is gamble, understand?
Do you have the guts? Bastard!

799
01:39:09,447 --> 01:39:11,608
-Enough. I'm on duty.
-Let me put a little.

800
01:39:11,816 --> 01:39:14,284
I said enough!

801
01:39:14,618 --> 01:39:17,451
Honestly! Scared of colour?
Always hollering...

802
01:39:21,292 --> 01:39:24,955
- Come and play colour, darling...
-Buzz off.

803
01:39:25,629 --> 01:39:29,121
-Showing off, eh?
-Put some on him too...

804
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:35,962
Even they can play, but you can't.
You're forgiven!

805
01:40:16,747 --> 01:40:18,180
Take him to the police station.
I'll join you.

806
01:40:18,249 --> 01:40:22,686
- The bastard!
- What was the name? Lohar?

807
01:40:22,953 --> 01:40:25,012
Forget it.He made a mistake.

808
01:40:25,689 --> 01:40:27,850
-Forgive him.
-Really?

809
01:40:28,692 --> 01:40:30,683
He lifted his hand at me! Me!

810
01:40:32,096 --> 01:40:35,361
Never mind.I'll have his job!

811
01:40:37,034 --> 01:40:39,696
- Get my father on the line.
-Let it be, sir.

812
01:40:40,371 --> 01:40:45,365
-Dial, I say.
-Had he known...

813
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:47,870
...who you are, he would've
never done this, would he?

814
01:40:50,047 --> 01:40:53,710
-He'll be punished!
-He's a nut, sir.

815
01:40:53,884 --> 01:40:57,718
He just re-joined and he struck
you. There goes his job again!

816
01:41:01,225 --> 01:41:04,717
-How come he's in my chair?
- Why ask him?

817
01:41:05,129 --> 01:41:08,064
- You come here. Come on...
- What?

818
01:41:19,577 --> 01:41:21,568
Don't touch me.
I'm the C.M.'s son.

819
01:41:38,028 --> 01:41:39,757
Don't, sir! He's the C.M.'s son.

820
01:41:44,935 --> 01:41:51,272
So what if he's the C.M.'s brat?
He can't ''eve-Tease''girls.

821
01:41:56,614 --> 01:42:01,278
-Look, don't come forward.
- What will you do?

822
01:42:01,785 --> 01:42:06,779
Don't come near me, I say.
I shoot you. Shoot you!

823
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:27,644
This is due to your
cowardice.A brat...

824
01:42:27,711 --> 01:42:31,477
...snatches a gun from you, and
you just stand there. Come here.

825
01:42:32,483 --> 01:42:35,816
Come on.Kick him on
his arse! Come on.

826
01:42:36,987 --> 01:42:41,481
Come on... kick him.
Go on, kick him!

827
01:42:41,825 --> 01:42:45,317
Come on... kick!
kick him hard!

828
01:42:47,231 --> 01:42:51,497
- What's this?
-He was caught eve-teasing.

829
01:42:52,169 --> 01:42:54,831
But why hit him so much?
He was splattered with blood.

830
01:42:55,239 --> 01:43:00,006
No.It's red powder.He's hurt
a bit, but he deserves it.

831
01:43:01,845 --> 01:43:06,009
He went and sat in my chair
My staff was flattering him.

832
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:10,342
He was misbehaving.
Reciting fiilmi dialogues,

833
01:43:10,521 --> 01:43:13,354
''I'll show you Inspector.''
''I'm the C.M.'s son!''

834
01:43:14,858 --> 01:43:19,522
Does being the C.M.'s son, mean
he'll harass the girls?

835
01:43:19,763 --> 01:43:24,029
I don't know all that, they think
I'm favouring you unduly,

836
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:25,090
True.

837
01:43:28,038 --> 01:43:31,371
-And what about the job I gave you?
-I can't bear to see it.

838
01:43:34,878 --> 01:43:37,711
I always told you to use your
temper as strength, not weakness.

839
01:43:38,983 --> 01:43:40,974
Now go! The C.M. has called you.

840
01:44:11,582 --> 01:44:15,416
-How come you're here?
- You called me to tell me...

841
01:44:15,486 --> 01:44:19,923
...that you're not happy with my
work. Shall I tell you this?

842
01:44:20,424 --> 01:44:24,258
I'm also not happy with your work
first repair the faults at home.

843
01:44:24,328 --> 01:44:28,264
Then see to the state.
Make your son understand.

844
01:44:28,599 --> 01:44:34,094
That you serve the people. When
you had begged for votes...

845
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:37,602
...they didn't know that the people
they're voting for today...

846
01:44:37,675 --> 01:44:40,109
...their sons will eve-tease
their daughters tomorrow.

847
01:44:40,344 --> 01:44:45,782
Hey! Calm down, will you?
Take him out, somebody.

848
01:44:46,083 --> 01:44:49,450
-But why is he angry?
- What can one do?

849
01:44:51,455 --> 01:44:54,117
This will always be hike this.
Let's get on with our work.

850
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,799
The Commissioner is in a meeting
He has sent you a photograph.

851
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:11,964
That man has come about a drug deal.
He'll leave in the morning.

852
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:14,306
If he can be caught, good.
Here, take this.

853
01:46:36,393 --> 01:46:39,385
Show them the sample.
If they like it...

854
01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:42,221
...send them the consignment.

855
01:46:51,742 --> 01:46:55,906
People in ''224''are my guests.
Put their bill on my account.

856
01:47:54,638 --> 01:47:57,471
- Who's the manager here?
- Your father, you bastard!

857
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:55,523
There's some news about
Inspector Lohar here, yet again.

858
01:48:57,367 --> 01:49:02,202
Our correspondent's report
The bullying of Ins. Lohar...

859
01:49:02,272 --> 01:49:07,209
...has reached its Zenith.
The public is fed of this.

860
01:49:08,211 --> 01:49:11,874
He didn't even spare the son
of the C.M.! On ''Holi''day...

861
01:49:12,215 --> 01:49:14,706
...the C.M.'s son was
enjoying himself with his friends.

862
01:49:15,552 --> 01:49:19,886
Ins. Lohar deliberately beat
him up and jailed him.

863
01:49:20,223 --> 01:49:24,387
Last night, he whipped a decent
man at a hotel.

864
01:49:24,728 --> 01:49:28,721
People say he's a sadist who
gets pleasure in beating up people.

865
01:49:29,466 --> 01:49:33,903
Please recall, that because
of such actions, Lohar...

866
01:49:33,971 --> 01:49:37,566
...was suspended some time back,
But he still hasn't learnt his lesson.

867
01:49:38,909 --> 01:49:43,073
- There's a saying in English...
-Nonsense! It's all bullshit!

868
01:49:44,414 --> 01:49:47,747
They're hounding Yashwant.
They want to suspend him again.

869
01:49:49,252 --> 01:49:51,413
-It's all a plot,
-If so,...

870
01:49:52,255 --> 01:49:53,916
... then the C.M.,
won't let his son be beaten.

871
01:49:54,257 --> 01:49:56,248
He was beaten because
of his own doing.

872
01:49:57,761 --> 01:50:00,423
He was drunk and teasing the girls.
What else could Yashwant do?

873
01:50:02,099 --> 01:50:05,262
And that drug-smuggler...
should he have let him escape?

874
01:50:05,502 --> 01:50:09,768
-Normally one arrests and jails.
- This doesn't happen normally!

875
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:15,776
Normally police arrest just show
And a part of the stuff is caught.

876
01:50:16,613 --> 01:50:19,605
Then in a 5 -star Hotel,
a sum is fiixed as a bribe.

877
01:50:20,450 --> 01:50:24,784
Only what is caught is news. Not
what gets away. Yashwant's not so.

878
01:50:35,298 --> 01:50:37,289
How long will I have to wait?

879
01:50:40,303 --> 01:50:43,295
- What is it?
-My camera is stolen.

880
01:50:45,142 --> 01:50:47,133
Is it stolen, or has
someone snatched it?

881
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:48,971
No, it;s stolen.

882
01:50:49,312 --> 01:50:52,645
-Sit down.From where?
-I was covering a march.

883
01:50:55,318 --> 01:50:58,651
Listen, you'll find Chikna Abdul
near Khyber.Bring him here.

884
01:51:02,325 --> 01:51:04,657
- Where do you work?
-I'm a journalist.

885
01:51:05,996 --> 01:51:08,328
- Where, I said.
-In ''Navbharat Times''.

886
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,491
- Your name?
-Deepak Sharma

887
01:51:20,343 --> 01:51:24,177
- You wrote this?
- Yes, I did.

888
01:51:24,414 --> 01:51:27,508
-Read it.
- Why? I've written it myself.

889
01:51:31,354 --> 01:51:33,345
Do you know this man?
Ever met him?

890
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:37,182
No, I haven't.
Who'll play with fire?

891
01:51:37,694 --> 01:51:40,026
- Why?
- Ofcourse, what else?

892
01:51:40,597 --> 01:51:43,862
I hear he talks with his hands
Doesn't know laws and regulations.

893
01:51:44,534 --> 01:51:48,026
This is democracy not dictatorship.
We all have our rights here.

894
01:51:48,538 --> 01:51:53,032
Prove the crime.Let the court
punish him. Who's this guy to hit us?

895
01:51:54,377 --> 01:51:59,713
See how decent you are
such a man should be suspended.

896
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:02,211
I'll write a lot more
about this man.

897
01:52:02,886 --> 01:52:05,787
Next time you pen
print his photo too.

898
01:52:05,889 --> 01:52:07,880
Let the public know
who this despot is!

899
01:52:09,893 --> 01:52:12,555
- Greetings, sir.
-Ah Abdul! Come on in...

900
01:52:16,233 --> 01:52:19,225
-Sit down.
-It's alright, sir.

901
01:52:19,736 --> 01:52:24,400
-How are things? At home?
-All well, thanks.

902
01:52:25,008 --> 01:52:27,738
-Had your lunch?
-No, sir,

903
01:52:28,411 --> 01:52:31,073
You haven't, eh?
Here, take this.

904
01:52:34,084 --> 01:52:38,145
- Take this. Have this biryani.
-I don't understand, sir.

905
01:52:38,221 --> 01:52:40,212
Eat, I'll explain later.
Now eat.

906
01:53:04,781 --> 01:53:09,616
Finished?
Here, drink this,

907
01:53:11,788 --> 01:53:16,122
Do you know who he is?
He writes against injustice.

908
01:53:16,626 --> 01:53:20,460
He's a big shot.
His camera is stolen.

909
01:53:22,465 --> 01:53:26,959
In that march today.
Give it to him.

910
01:53:27,137 --> 01:53:29,799
-I don't know about it, sir.
- Go on.

911
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:34,304
By God, sir, I don't...
I'll get it...

912
01:53:36,146 --> 01:53:38,137
Take this away... Come on...

913
01:53:40,817 --> 01:53:44,981
See? I fed him, gave him a drink.
Asked him properly, didn't admit.

914
01:53:46,223 --> 01:53:49,818
A slap near the ear and he came
clean. That's why we have to hit.

915
01:53:54,164 --> 01:53:58,498
If I feed everyone biryani, I'll
have to starve. Go, your bag's found.

916
01:53:59,502 --> 01:54:03,836
Return, if you want photographs.
I'm Lohar. Unearth. What you want.

917
01:54:04,674 --> 01:54:08,007
- Go and order one more biryani.
- Yes, sir.

918
01:54:08,772 --> 01:54:10,706
He has crossed the limit now!

919
01:54:15,612 --> 01:54:18,103
As long as he's alive,
I'll know no peace.

920
01:54:21,618 --> 01:54:24,610
Go! But remember, after death,
he has to be shown as a martyr.

921
01:54:25,622 --> 01:54:29,956
Your order will be carried out.
But you're forgetting politics?

922
01:54:30,627 --> 01:54:35,291
- You're getting emotional.
-Right. When my son was hurt...

923
01:54:35,366 --> 01:54:38,631
-...I had lost my head.
- The photos are ready and good.

924
01:54:39,636 --> 01:54:43,299
-It's time the public saw them.
- You're right for the 1st time.

925
01:54:43,474 --> 01:54:46,637
-She looks very decent.
-But nowadays one can't really say.

926
01:55:01,158 --> 01:55:02,648
Here she comes.

927
01:55:27,518 --> 01:55:30,180
I'm still alive.
I think, I understand.

928
01:55:32,189 --> 01:55:35,352
I've some small needs. Some demands.
That someone love me.

929
01:55:35,959 --> 01:55:38,519
Fight with me. Quarrel.
Get cross, and make up too.

930
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:44,361
I should need someone.
Someone could need me.

931
01:55:46,703 --> 01:55:48,694
But this never happened.

932
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:54,367
Who was my mother?

933
01:55:55,712 --> 01:55:58,203
Don't know.Father? Don't know.

934
01:55:58,882 --> 01:56:01,715
When was I put in an orphanage
by a constable? Don't know.

935
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:07,884
I was cared for like a weed.
I grew up on punches, kicks...

936
01:56:07,991 --> 01:56:11,051
...and food off other people's
plates. Why? I don't know.

937
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:19,393
How, and why did I educate
myself? Don't know.

938
01:56:20,737 --> 01:56:23,729
Why I joined the police?
Don't know.I knew just one thing.

939
01:56:24,074 --> 01:56:27,237
Every time, at every place...

940
01:56:30,581 --> 01:56:32,572
I was not wanted.

941
01:56:38,922 --> 01:56:42,255
Look at my colleagues in
the police department.

942
01:56:48,432 --> 01:56:52,926
Because I'm a hurdle in
their black earnings.

943
01:56:54,438 --> 01:56:59,273
They think I'm a traitor.
I don't ffit in their scheme.

944
01:57:03,614 --> 01:57:06,447
Anyway, who are these people?

945
01:57:06,617 --> 01:57:09,450
My wife.My own dear wife.
She too.

946
01:57:12,289 --> 01:57:15,122
I married an orphan girl. Thought...

947
01:57:15,459 --> 01:57:20,123
...two orphans will understand
each other better. That constable...

948
01:57:20,197 --> 01:57:24,793
...give me a name in the orphanage.
That name, that borrowed name...

949
01:57:24,868 --> 01:57:28,463
...I gave my wife. Gave her
my name, my love.

950
01:57:30,207 --> 01:57:32,471
Name...Lohar.

951
01:57:34,311 --> 01:57:38,270
Ragini Yashwant Lohar.
She's fed up of that name.

952
01:57:38,348 --> 01:57:40,339
She's in search of another name now.

953
01:57:41,985 --> 01:57:43,976
I'm going to kill them both!

954
01:57:54,498 --> 01:57:57,331
-Anyway, your fees doctor.
- Where are you going now?

955
01:57:57,834 --> 01:58:00,997
- You're mental state is bad.
- When was it fine?

956
01:58:01,838 --> 01:58:04,500
Rs. 200 per session. That makes
it 400/-for 2 sessions.

957
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:09,843
It's quite possible.
Both are young...

958
01:58:10,013 --> 01:58:12,675
...Good looking. Old friendship.

959
01:58:14,685 --> 01:58:17,677
An old lost spark may have
been fanned again.

960
01:58:19,856 --> 01:58:23,849
Then there's hunger.Mental or
physical hunger is hunger.

961
01:58:25,095 --> 01:58:27,086
I also wasn't around.

962
01:58:35,872 --> 01:58:37,362
Adjustment of our needs.

963
01:58:42,546 --> 01:58:46,380
What can one do? We all
have our needs. Right?

964
01:58:47,217 --> 01:58:49,879
Enough now! You've had
more than 1/2 bottle.

965
01:58:50,554 --> 01:58:53,045
Have this. Come on...

966
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:59,552
Couldn't she wait for me
a bit longer?

967
01:59:00,731 --> 01:59:03,222
I went in, and she let herself go.

968
01:59:05,902 --> 01:59:09,065
I trusted a wrong woman.

969
01:59:10,574 --> 01:59:13,566
Saw a handsome boy, and,
she fell for him! Bloody whore!

970
01:59:16,413 --> 01:59:18,904
Doubt has made a home in your mind.

971
01:59:19,916 --> 01:59:24,410
You doubt your wife?
You bloody... Get out!

972
01:59:25,489 --> 01:59:28,424
That woman ruined and
sacrifficed her home life...

973
01:59:28,492 --> 01:59:32,588
...because of your mistake.
And you doubt her?=
Shameless!

974
01:59:32,929 --> 01:59:36,592
Get up! And get out.Don't
ever show your face again!

975
01:59:36,933 --> 01:59:40,334
It was an inauspicious moment
when I became friends with you.

976
01:59:40,604 --> 01:59:44,267
Shame on your life!
I spit on your kind!

977
01:59:48,945 --> 01:59:50,936
Open the door.I'm hungry.

978
02:00:02,292 --> 02:00:06,126
Don't feel lonely.
I'll always be there for you.

979
02:00:09,533 --> 02:00:12,468
Let him click.Are you
scared of them?

980
02:00:13,303 --> 02:00:16,136
How many photos will they print?
What will they prove?

981
02:00:16,973 --> 02:00:21,637
That I'm a cheap woman.
We don't feel guilty about it.

982
02:00:23,313 --> 02:00:25,645
I'm your friend. You're mine.

983
02:00:26,983 --> 02:00:31,477
This too is a relation.
But a maligned one.

984
02:00:31,655 --> 02:00:35,989
A much misunderstood one.
Why, I don't know.

985
02:00:37,661 --> 02:00:39,652
But in whose eyes
will they malign me?

986
02:00:41,164 --> 02:00:44,998
In the eyes of the world.
I don't fear them.

987
02:00:46,570 --> 02:00:50,666
Yashwant has built a lot of
strength in me. They think...

988
02:00:51,341 --> 02:00:54,674
...I'll fall in this eyes?
Forget it.

989
02:00:57,013 --> 02:01:00,505
They don't know him.I do.

990
02:01:01,685 --> 02:01:03,676
He trusts me so implicitly.

991
02:01:06,690 --> 02:01:08,021
Anything else?

992
02:01:12,529 --> 02:01:16,192
Being a senior police offiicer,
he married an orphan girl.

993
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:21,535
Gave her his name,
He never let me feel...

994
02:01:21,605 --> 02:01:26,372
...that I was an orphan.He
educated me and made be able.

995
02:01:28,278 --> 02:01:31,714
Who does so much for anyone?
Yes...

996
02:01:32,048 --> 02:01:36,712
...we do live separately, no doubt,
but we still share same relationship.

997
02:01:38,555 --> 02:01:42,889
My life starts on one word.

998
02:01:44,561 --> 02:01:46,552
And ends on it too.

999
02:02:08,084 --> 02:02:11,417
- You, and here?
-Surprised, are you?

1000
02:02:12,088 --> 02:02:14,079
No...

1001
02:02:17,093 --> 02:02:22,429
- Too much work, eh?
-No, just a little...

1002
02:02:22,632 --> 02:02:24,657
...Not ''a little'', but ''a lot''!

1003
02:02:37,781 --> 02:02:39,271
It's a conspiracy.

1004
02:02:41,952 --> 02:02:45,444
-By whom?
- The one who is against you and me.

1005
02:02:48,692 --> 02:02:55,962
A big conspiracy...

1006
02:02:58,134 --> 02:03:02,969
First they dumped this bastard in
water and then put you in his arms.

1007
02:03:03,473 --> 02:03:05,464
Then they took the photograph.

1008
02:03:07,143 --> 02:03:09,134
A very big conspiracy indeed!

1009
02:03:20,991 --> 02:03:23,824
Young...I'm also young.

1010
02:03:24,661 --> 02:03:28,825
Not as young as him.
He's much younger.

1011
02:03:31,334 --> 02:03:36,328
Just because he's young,
you slept with him. Whore!

1012
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:06,191
For the first time...

1013
02:04:08,538 --> 02:04:10,529
...I felt I'm really an orphan.

1014
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:19,204
Farce! I spoke the truth...

1015
02:04:19,282 --> 02:04:21,273
...and you found it so bitter.

1016
02:04:27,724 --> 02:04:31,888
Till now, you never looked
into my eyes and spoke.

1017
02:04:33,063 --> 02:04:36,396
Today, you hit me like this.

1018
02:04:39,235 --> 02:04:42,068
I can blow your brains
to pieces even now.

1019
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:47,732
But first I'll kill
that bastard. Then...

1020
02:04:47,811 --> 02:04:50,746
I'll see how your face reacts.

1021
02:04:51,915 --> 02:04:53,906
And then later...

1022
02:05:01,925 --> 02:05:04,416
You never looked in my eyes...
and today you...

1023
02:05:09,432 --> 02:05:13,425
New sari, eh? You never
wore good clothes for me.

1024
02:05:14,938 --> 02:05:16,929
But for him...

1025
02:05:21,678 --> 02:05:25,944
New sari for him.
Open the door, go on...

1026
02:05:46,803 --> 02:05:52,969
An imported dog barks anyhow...
You always bark up a wrong tree!

1027
02:05:53,977 --> 02:05:57,970
Where did you get the photo?
Tell me.

1028
02:05:58,314 --> 02:06:01,977
Who ordered you to print it?
Tell me, where did you get it?

1029
02:06:04,654 --> 02:06:08,818
Who asked you to print it?
Name him.

1030
02:06:08,992 --> 02:06:11,324
It wasn't me.Inspector
Joshi asked me to.

1031
02:06:30,346 --> 02:06:31,335
Have you gone mad?

1032
02:06:54,037 --> 02:06:56,028
This is too much!
Get out of here!

1033
02:07:11,387 --> 02:07:16,552
I don't have a passport-size
photo with my wife.

1034
02:07:18,561 --> 02:07:23,225
You snapped her with that
bastard in the water...

1035
02:07:25,735 --> 02:07:28,727
You always drink foreign liquor.

1036
02:07:31,007 --> 02:07:33,737
I'm not even destined
to drink country hooch!

1037
02:07:34,811 --> 02:07:38,247
Sometimes my lawyer
friend, offers me some.

1038
02:07:40,016 --> 02:07:44,749
Today he threw me out without
dinner.He hit me like this...

1039
02:07:54,097 --> 02:07:57,931
Everything...
Everything is imported.

1040
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:02,761
Don't you have anything
that's made-in-India?

1041
02:08:16,286 --> 02:08:20,780
I'm Yashwant Lohar.
Age, till my next breath.

1042
02:08:22,125 --> 02:08:25,617
I'm a policeman.It's
my religion and duty.

1043
02:08:25,795 --> 02:08:29,959
Parents, not known.I've such
a face that the goons think I'm...

1044
02:08:30,033 --> 02:08:33,628
-...a police and vise versa.
-He's mad, my dear.

1045
02:08:33,703 --> 02:08:36,638
-Don't talk to him. Go inside.
-He made me crazy.

1046
02:08:38,141 --> 02:08:41,975
And you drove him mad.
You must have hounded him...

1047
02:08:42,045 --> 02:08:45,981
...to bring this, bring that.
Your demands increased...

1048
02:08:51,988 --> 02:08:53,888
I just asked for children.

1049
02:09:01,831 --> 02:09:05,494
-Is Mr.Joshi there?
-He just left. Salim Sheikh.

1050
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:00,113
Look.I've put the gun down.

1051
02:11:02,118 --> 02:11:06,612
We're not enemies! I pulled the
trigger by mistake.Habit, y'see.

1052
02:11:09,225 --> 02:11:12,786
You're the best of friends.
How's your wife?

1053
02:11:33,816 --> 02:11:38,810
No! I've got very high contacts.
I can feed you to your gills!

1054
02:11:39,489 --> 02:11:42,652
I'll feed you instead.Feed
poison to kids, eh?

1055
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:46,651
Taste some yourself too.

1056
02:11:49,265 --> 02:11:51,665
-How much is this worth?
- 1,00,000/-.

1057
02:11:52,001 --> 02:11:56,995
Have some. Your father mustn't have
fed you such an expensive morsel.

1058
02:12:04,847 --> 02:12:08,180
-I'll die like this.
- You've lived too long anyway.

1059
02:12:08,684 --> 02:12:11,016
Let me show you
what you wish to rule.

1060
02:12:16,692 --> 02:12:19,525
I'll die, Yashwant.

1061
02:12:21,697 --> 02:12:24,689
There's still time...
Still time, Yashwant.

1062
02:12:25,701 --> 02:12:27,692
Still time...

1063
02:12:30,206 --> 02:12:32,697
-Still have time.
-But I don't have the time.

1064
02:12:33,776 --> 02:12:40,045
I've to sentence 2 more to death.
Joshi's waiting for you in hell.

1065
02:12:40,716 --> 02:12:42,707
Go, bribe him!

1066
02:16:08,924 --> 02:16:12,257
I want to confess.

1067
02:16:16,932 --> 02:16:17,921
I've sinned.

1068
02:16:19,935 --> 02:16:24,099
I loved a girl in college.
It was a one-way affair.

1069
02:16:25,941 --> 02:16:30,605
She didn't know I loved her.
I met her again after years.

1070
02:16:31,614 --> 02:16:32,945
But she was married by then.

1071
02:16:35,184 --> 02:16:39,120
I tried very hard, but I
couldn't forget I loved her.

1072
02:16:43,959 --> 02:16:47,122
I looked at a married
woman with lusty eyes.

1073
02:16:49,632 --> 02:16:54,296
Such a woman, who loves her
husband with all her heart.

1074
02:17:01,377 --> 02:17:03,368
I've wronged her, and her husband.

1075
02:17:05,548 --> 02:17:07,539
And I must be punished for it.

1076
02:17:08,984 --> 02:17:13,648
And they must get
life's choicest joys.

1077
02:17:40,249 --> 02:17:44,015
This is not your place. You should
be in the confession-box.

1078
02:17:52,027 --> 02:17:53,187
It's me.

1079
02:17:56,532 --> 02:17:58,523
I wish to speak to you.

1080
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:02,862
Can you come here?

1081
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:08,369
You're not saying anything.
I understand.

1082
02:18:10,446 --> 02:18:14,041
Please come here.I'll
be waiting for you.

1083
02:18:19,722 --> 02:18:21,713
Forgive me, dear.

1084
02:18:23,993 --> 02:18:26,052
I misbehaved with you yesterday.

1085
02:18:27,463 --> 02:18:32,059
I couldn't control myself
seeing that photograph.

1086
02:18:36,071 --> 02:18:40,405
Infact, I was scared that
I won't live without you.

1087
02:18:40,743 --> 02:18:45,077
I can't think of life,
without you in it.

1088
02:18:49,752 --> 02:18:54,746
I went to V.ikram.Drank booze.
He too hit me and threw me out!

1089
02:18:59,762 --> 02:19:04,927
If you leave me, I'll lose my power.
Won't be able to fight this world.

1090
02:19:09,104 --> 02:19:11,095
I have no one, but you.

1091
02:19:15,945 --> 02:19:17,936
-I won't live.
- Why are you lying?

1092
02:19:20,382 --> 02:19:24,443
You are a selfish man.
Rather, a devil!

1093
02:19:25,788 --> 02:19:29,121
Why, and how can I stay with you?
When I see your face...

1094
02:19:30,125 --> 02:19:32,116
...all those abuses ring in my ears.

1095
02:19:33,963 --> 02:19:37,956
You buried me yesterday. Your
apologies won't bring me back.

1096
02:19:39,535 --> 02:19:44,131
-Just this living corpse.Now...
-No.Don't say that.

1097
02:19:44,306 --> 02:19:48,800
I will never give you a chance
to complain again.Just for once...

1098
02:19:49,812 --> 02:19:51,803
Just this once...

1099
02:20:00,422 --> 02:20:03,823
Did you read? Sensational
news about you...

1100
02:20:09,765 --> 02:20:14,998
- What is it?
Why such a long face?

1101
02:20:16,171 --> 02:20:18,503
You really, have stirred
a hornets'nest! Listen...

1102
02:20:20,175 --> 02:20:23,167
The state C.M. had to resign
because of super-cop Lohar.

1103
02:20:23,512 --> 02:20:28,677
The C.M. was involved with the
narcotic lobby.Lohar exposed this.

1104
02:20:29,118 --> 02:20:34,181
The P.M. sacked the State
C.M. from his post yesterday.

1105
02:20:34,523 --> 02:20:39,187
A high-level inquiry will be held.
Centre has ordered the Commission...

1106
02:20:39,261 --> 02:20:44,699
...to change the present technique
to improve the image of the police.

1107
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:50,194
The Commission said the corrupt
offiicers will be suspended soon...

1108
02:20:50,372 --> 02:20:55,708
...and he has suggested Lohar's
name, because of his great daring...

1109
02:20:55,778 --> 02:20:58,872
...and loyalty, for the
President's Medal.Remember...

1110
02:20:59,048 --> 02:21:03,212
...he played an important role in
exposing corruption in State Govt. ...

1111
02:21:03,285 --> 02:21:08,222
...and the nexus between the top
offiicers and anti-social activists.

1112
02:21:08,891 --> 02:21:12,725
To fulfiill this mission he had to
confront many hurdles. He faced...

1113
02:21:12,795 --> 02:21:16,561
...the wrath of the corrupt offiicers
from his own department. This often...

1114
02:21:16,632 --> 02:21:20,227
...led to his suspension.Even
then, he stuck to his duty...

1115
02:21:20,502 --> 02:21:25,565
Never discarded honesty. Thus
his name is suggested for the honour.

1116
02:21:28,911 --> 02:21:32,403
Why are you crying? You've
done a great thing.

1117
02:21:33,248 --> 02:21:36,581
What will I do with all this?
She has left me.

1118
02:21:37,252 --> 02:21:40,244
-I called her, but she didn't come.
- Who? Who didn't come?

1119
02:21:45,260 --> 02:21:47,922
Why do you want her now?
She's a whore, isn't she?

1120
02:22:04,613 --> 02:22:08,777
Where were you? Give us a treat.
But why this long face?

1121
02:22:08,851 --> 02:22:13,117
These red eyes. Boozed a lot, eh?
Smile, see this. Your photo.

1122
02:22:13,455 --> 02:22:16,117
Now you'll get an uniform.
That of an Inspector!

1123
02:22:17,626 --> 02:22:20,459
- Where are you going?
-My wife's offiice.

1124
02:22:21,296 --> 02:22:23,457
She works too?

1125
02:22:24,299 --> 02:22:27,291
Doesn't one pay suffiice? Don't you
earn ''extra''? Come, let's meet her.

1126
02:22:40,049 --> 02:22:44,486
Stop the car.
I want to talk to you.

1127
02:22:46,755 --> 02:22:50,316
Stop! I want to talk.

1128
02:22:51,326 --> 02:22:54,989
Stop the car. Stop it, I say!

1129
02:23:18,587 --> 02:23:20,578
Please forgive me.
I made a blunder.

1130
02:23:21,023 --> 02:23:24,857
Hit me if you wish, but don't
leave me.I've nothing but you.

1131
02:23:27,362 --> 02:23:29,353
From today, your wish
is my command.

1132
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:35,363
I'll close my eyes and live.
Seal my lips;, Bow my head and live.

1133
02:23:37,372 --> 02:23:42,867
I just think of our house,
our kids and our comfort.

1134
02:23:43,378 --> 02:23:46,870
I'll give everything to my kids.
And for that I'll take bribe.

1135
02:23:49,384 --> 02:23:53,047
I'll become dishonest.
But please don't leave me.

1136
02:23:56,225 --> 02:23:58,716
If anybody's being murdered.
I'll keep quiet.

1137
02:24:00,395 --> 02:24:03,057
If any woman's being raped
I'll shut my eyes to it.

1138
02:24:03,398 --> 02:24:08,563
-I'll change with the times...
-Let go! He's taking my purse.

1139
02:24:33,028 --> 02:24:35,087
Want a paper?
There's his photo in it.

1140
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:48,771
I'll have to fight another case
free of charge.Better I leave.

1141
02:24:52,514 --> 02:24:54,607
A very dangerous being.
But he's my friend.
