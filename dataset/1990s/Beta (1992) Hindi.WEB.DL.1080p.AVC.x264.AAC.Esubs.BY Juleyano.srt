It'll become incurable.
And then the poison will spread.

You've raised me.
You've imbibed values within me.

If you had found a rich family...

as much dowry as you wanted!

It's written that if Raju

...and if his wife conceives...

...the child could be a

Do you know yesterday was
brother Raju's wedding night?

1046
01:18:36,575 --> 01:18:39,016
Yet he was sleeping at
the back of the house.

1047
01:18:39,911 --> 01:18:41,876
- What are you saying?
- I'm telling the truth.

1048
01:18:44,651 --> 01:18:46,341
Brother Raju's is very unfortunate.

1049
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,005
His mother turned out to be a witch.

1050
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,719
And the wife, exactly the same.

1051
01:18:53,373 --> 01:18:55,074
Here comes the madam.

1052
01:18:59,954 --> 01:19:01,702
Pandu, what are you making?

1053
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:04,110
Can't you see? I'm making gourd vegetable!

1054
01:19:05,664 --> 01:19:06,784
I'll make it.

1055
01:19:07,685 --> 01:19:08,701
Here, make it!

1056
01:19:11,017 --> 01:19:12,537
Why are you talking to me like that?

1057
01:19:12,578 --> 01:19:14,662
I don't respect a woman who...

1058
01:19:14,773 --> 01:19:16,498
...doesn't have any
respect for her husband.

1059
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:19,083
- But what have I done?
- See what you've done!

1060
01:19:19,507 --> 01:19:21,033
Yesterday was brother
Raju's wedding night.

1061
01:19:21,232 --> 01:19:24,682
Still he was sleeping at the back
of the house. Why? Answer me!

1062
01:19:25,297 --> 01:19:28,577
If you didn't consider him
worthy, why did you marry him?

1063
01:19:28,734 --> 01:19:30,783
Who says I don't consider
him worthy of me?

1064
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,266
The truth is I'm not worthy of him.

1065
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:38,750
Then whatever I had heard...

1066
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:39,813
All that was a lie.

1067
01:19:41,787 --> 01:19:42,781
You don't know.

1068
01:19:43,482 --> 01:19:45,496
The elders of this house
want to separate us...

1069
01:19:45,834 --> 01:19:47,639
...for their own selfish reasons!

1070
01:19:47,937 --> 01:19:49,375
They want to break our marriage.

1071
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:53,758
But I'll never let them
fulfill their desire.

1072
01:19:54,775 --> 01:19:57,827
Just think. He protected me...

1073
01:19:58,244 --> 01:20:00,517
...and saved me from defamation.

1074
01:20:01,385 --> 01:20:02,813
Won't I respect him?

1075
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:08,613
You don't know, Pandu,
he dwells in my heart.

1076
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:13,383
Forgive me, sister-in-law,
I misunderstood you.

1077
01:20:14,514 --> 01:20:18,000
- You can hit me with your sandals.
- What are you doing?

1078
01:20:18,025 --> 01:20:20,304
Pandu, quickly bring the food!

1079
01:20:20,745 --> 01:20:23,025
- I'm dying of hunger!
- Die!

1080
01:20:23,934 --> 01:20:24,794
Coming!

1081
01:20:25,997 --> 01:20:27,055
What a big glutton they are!

1082
01:20:27,082 --> 01:20:28,681
They're never content no
matter how much you feed them.

1083
01:20:28,854 --> 01:20:31,174
Champa, first go and feed father.

1084
01:20:31,237 --> 01:20:33,472
- Then we'll feed these animals.
- Okay.

1085
01:20:36,107 --> 01:20:37,008
What is this?

1086
01:20:37,604 --> 01:20:39,126
Father is fed this food.

1087
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:42,000
What can I do, sister-in-law?
I feel sad too.

1088
01:20:42,788 --> 01:20:44,865
- But those...
- Don't worry about them.

1089
01:20:46,271 --> 01:20:48,704
From today I'll take food for father.

1090
01:20:58,963 --> 01:20:59,631
Father.

1091
01:21:06,893 --> 01:21:08,861
- Daughter-in-law, you!
- Yes.

1092
01:21:09,844 --> 01:21:13,354
The family members eat and the
head of the family stays hungry.

1093
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:15,119
It doesn't look nice.

1094
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:16,830
Come.

1095
01:21:21,494 --> 01:21:23,336
Today I'll feed you.

1096
01:21:24,469 --> 01:21:25,173
Sit.

1097
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,770
Father, you're crying.

1098
01:21:44,212 --> 01:21:47,532
For the past 20 years I
was craving for this love.

1099
01:21:49,597 --> 01:21:51,902
I was hungry for someone's affection.

1100
01:21:53,662 --> 01:21:54,999
Can I ask you something?

1101
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:58,293
Why is this injustice going on
in this house for so many years?

1102
01:21:58,364 --> 01:21:59,665
Why doesn't anyone stop it?

1103
01:21:59,852 --> 01:22:01,877
I tried to stop her alone.

1104
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:08,356
But along with her brother my
wife proved me to be insane...

1105
01:22:09,561 --> 01:22:11,558
...and left me in this hell to die.

1106
01:22:16,244 --> 01:22:18,246
I wanted to bring a mother for Raju.

1107
01:22:19,597 --> 01:22:21,137
But I brought a vamp.

1108
01:22:22,415 --> 01:22:25,562
She didn't let my Raju study.
She kept him as an illiterate.

1109
01:22:25,819 --> 01:22:27,450
So that she can take advantage of it!

1110
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:33,121
My Raju considers that witch a Goddess!
He worships her!

1111
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:38,168
Before she kills my Raju, save my son.

1112
01:22:39,174 --> 01:22:40,409
Save my Raju.

1113
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:50,403
Gauri, Rani work carefully.

1114
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:52,926
- Sir, where should I keep this?
- On my head.

1115
01:22:53,231 --> 01:22:56,277
Look, if the crop this year is not...

1116
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:01,903
What are you doing?

1117
01:23:01,928 --> 01:23:03,887
You fool! Did I ask you
to keep it on my head?

1118
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:06,288
- You said it.
- Keep it there! Go!

1119
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:10,840
What is it, brother Raju?
You're looking very sad.

1120
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:12,887
Seems like he didn't
sleep the entire night.

1121
01:23:12,912 --> 01:23:15,223
Stop blabbering and work.

1122
01:23:15,292 --> 01:23:17,011
- We're working.
- [BIRD CHIRPING]

1123
01:23:17,045 --> 01:23:20,644
Oh God! Brother Raju,
here comes your bride.

1124
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:27,269
Brother Raju, what spell have
you cast on her in one night...

1125
01:23:27,294 --> 01:23:29,454
...that she doesn't even
leave you during the day?

1126
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:33,060
Why have you come here?

1127
01:23:33,377 --> 01:23:34,769
I want to talk to you.

1128
01:23:36,397 --> 01:23:38,988
Whatever you want to say,
say it in that hut. Come.

1129
01:23:42,072 --> 01:23:43,450
He's taking her in the hut.

1130
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:51,893
- Listen, I want to tell you...
- I know what you want to say.

1131
01:23:52,214 --> 01:23:54,051
You want to say I'm not worthy of you.

1132
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:57,540
- Listen to me.
- I've heard it. You said at the fair...

1133
01:23:57,941 --> 01:23:59,901
...you'll marry only a prince...

1134
01:23:59,988 --> 01:24:01,748
- ...not a fool like me.
- But...

1135
01:24:01,938 --> 01:24:04,058
Saru, I'm your husband.

1136
01:24:04,356 --> 01:24:06,365
But I never tried to
assert my right on you.

1137
01:24:07,268 --> 01:24:08,277
Why didn't you?

1138
01:24:08,321 --> 01:24:10,026
What are you doing?

1139
01:24:10,477 --> 01:24:12,238
Marriage is the union of two souls.

1140
01:24:12,867 --> 01:24:14,738
Then let this union take place today.

[BIRD CHIRPING]

1142
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,332
Do you think that you will
melt me by behaving like this?

1143
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:23,191
I will die but will not
let you come close to me.

1144
01:24:23,398 --> 01:24:26,058
- Please agree, my prince.
- Never.

1145
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:30,809
Listen. Don't force me to be 'Meneka'
(Indian mythological danseuse).

1146
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,238
Listen. I am not sage 'Vishwamitra'
(Indian mythological sage)...

1147
01:24:33,263 --> 01:24:35,961
...that I will get lured.

1148
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:43,020
- Is it? Is that what you think?
- Yes.

1149
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,727
Yes, that is it.

1150
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:49,941
Do you think that if you do all
this something will happen to me?

1151
01:24:54,128 --> 01:24:56,401
- Can you feel anything?
- No.

1152
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,326
How about now?

1153
01:25:08,142 --> 01:25:09,234
No...

1154
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:14,545
- What now?
- Yes, I can.

1155
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:19,778
- Now?
- Yes, I can.

1156
01:25:22,191 --> 01:25:26,069
- Can you feel now?
- Yes, I can.

1157
01:25:53,785 --> 01:25:56,262
- Gauri. Hey, Gauri.
- What is it?

1158
01:25:57,066 --> 01:25:58,668
- I am going home.
- Why?

1159
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:01,128
I am missing him.

1160
01:26:01,605 --> 01:26:02,628
Hey, listen.

01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:12,418
"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

1163
01:27:20,381 --> 01:27:24,919
"My eyes will lower with shyness."

1164
01:27:25,429 --> 01:27:30,069
"I'll feel coy."

1165
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,977
"My eyes will lower with shyness."

1166
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:35,465
"I'll feel coy."

1167
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:40,437
"How can I just say
what happened with me?"

1168
01:27:40,475 --> 01:27:43,645
"Ask me, friend."

01:27:43,677 --> 01:27:50,794
"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

"You're under our oath,
don't hide anything from us."

1171
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:30,915
"Tell me, how did your
garland become a mess?"

1172
01:28:31,065 --> 01:28:33,114
"Tell us!"

1173
01:28:33,667 --> 01:28:35,889
'Tell us!'

1174
01:28:36,451 --> 01:28:41,432
"There was a bee in my garland."

1175
01:28:41,457 --> 01:28:46,338
"I was shooing it away with my hands."

1176
01:28:46,481 --> 01:28:49,801
"It was delicate."

1177
01:28:51,511 --> 01:28:56,615
"It was delicate.
It broke as soon as I touched it."

1178
01:28:56,686 --> 01:29:02,615
"And the flowers got scattered."

1179
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:17,091
"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

1180
01:29:17,594 --> 01:29:24,896
"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

1181
01:29:27,673 --> 01:29:32,130
"Tell me, why there are
teeth marks on your lips..."

1182
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:36,873
"How did you get nail marks here?"

01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:38,984
"Tell us!"

01:29:39,491 --> 01:29:41,911
"Tell us!"

1185
01:29:42,027 --> 01:29:46,920
"I saw a parrot in the night."

1186
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:52,136
"I was enticed seeing it."

1187
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:57,690
"I went to pet the lovely parrot."

01:29:59,671 --> 01:30:04,675
"I went to pet the lovely parrot."

01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:10,498
"He pecked on my lips and flew away."

1190
01:30:17,865 --> 01:30:25,034
"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

1191
01:30:25,573 --> 01:30:32,753
"Tell us, what did you say
sneakily to your beloved?"

01:30:35,649 --> 01:30:39,950
"Why are your tresses entangled?"

1193
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:44,771
"Why are you clothes so wrinkled?"

1194
01:30:44,835 --> 01:30:46,835
"Tell us!"

1195
01:30:47,426 --> 01:30:49,756
"Tell us!"

1196
01:30:50,122 --> 01:30:55,002
"There was an unknown pain in my heart."

1197
01:30:55,052 --> 01:30:59,797
"My restlessness grew,
I started suffering."

1198
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:04,920
"When I couldn't tolerate
the pain anymore..."

1199
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:11,032
"...I held my heart with my own hands."

1200

"We can't understand this problem?"

1201
01:31:37,555 --> 01:31:41,635
"Why have you worn the
skirt the wrong way?"

1202
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:43,676
"Tell us!"

1203
01:31:44,173 --> 01:31:46,274
"Tell us!"

1204
01:31:52,647 --> 01:31:54,764
"You've been caught!"

1205
01:31:54,804 --> 01:31:57,336
"You've been caught!"

1206
01:31:57,670 --> 01:31:59,538
"You've been caught!"

1207
01:31:59,649 --> 01:32:02,703
"Look, she has been caught!"

1208
01:32:07,216 --> 01:32:10,297
"Come here."

1209
01:32:12,172 --> 01:32:15,282
"I'll tell you everything."

1210
01:32:17,137 --> 01:32:19,602
"Come here."

1211
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:22,057
"I'll tell you everything."

1212
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:26,890
"I'll not keep any secret from you."

1213
01:32:27,064 --> 01:32:32,578

- What is it, son?

Look, Ramesh has become a doctor...

1223
01:33:37,402 --> 01:33:39,357

- Really?

- Yes, son.

a girl or do you like someone?

What? Tell me who that girl is?
How is her family?

What does she do? What is her name?

not the traditional kind.

I should apologise, Suru.

1493
01:52:27,357 --> 01:52:29,633
The whip will be of no use in this matter!

1494
01:52:29,859 --> 01:52:32,396
Here is the gun.
There are real bullets in it.

1495

...or else I'll shoot you!

Stop acting, Uncle!

1507

I'm being punished so
severely for a small mistake.

1511

Mother, being your brother...

1512
01:53:11,098 --> 01:53:13,095
...I gave him the responsibility
of maintaining the accounts.

1513
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,587
And he deceived the one
who gave him shelter!

1514
01:53:15,651 --> 01:53:17,057
And swindled millions of rupees.

1515
01:53:17,146 --> 01:53:21,774
I've realised my mistake. Forgive me.

1516
01:53:21,816 --> 01:53:22,827
Get up, brother.

01:53:23,265 --> 01:53:25,825
Let it be, son.
What has happened has happened.

1518
01:53:26,441 --> 01:53:28,283
- Forgive him.
- Forgive me.

1519
01:53:28,962 --> 01:53:31,794
Fine, Mother.
If you say so, I'll forgive him.

1520
01:53:32,021 --> 01:53:33,164
What are you saying?

1521
01:53:33,396 --> 01:53:35,657
If he had deceived just you,
it would've been fine...

1522
01:53:36,139 --> 01:53:38,339
...but he has deceived
your great mother too.

1523
01:53:38,364 --> 01:53:40,609
- How can you spare him?
- Absolutely right.

1524
01:53:41,131 --> 01:53:44,237
Mother, you're very innocent.
That's why everyone deceives you.

1525
01:53:44,505 --> 01:53:46,273
We shouldn't trust a person like him.

1526
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:49,277
Tell me, uncle,
where have you kept the swindled money?

1527
01:53:49,349 --> 01:53:50,536
- Or else...
- Don't shoot.

1528
01:53:50,616 --> 01:53:53,102
Snake! Snake!

1529
01:53:53,136 --> 01:53:55,805
There is a snake in my room!

1530
01:53:56,145 --> 01:54:00,303
- I won't let you take the mattress.
- No.

1531
01:54:00,328 --> 01:54:02,664
I won't give you this mattress.
There is a snake in it.

1532
01:54:02,689 --> 01:54:04,943
- What happened?
- There is a snake in this mattress.

1533
01:54:04,968 --> 01:54:07,383
He's mad. To him, a rope is a snake.

1534
01:54:08,043 --> 01:54:09,656
If you don't find a
snake in this mattress...

1535
01:54:09,913 --> 01:54:11,450
...you can send me to the asylum today.

1536
01:54:11,483 --> 01:54:13,603
Let this madmen mumble. Listen to me.

1537
01:54:14,257 --> 01:54:16,164
Pandu, bring the mattress outside.

1538
01:54:16,189 --> 01:54:18,672
- My mattress!
- Move.

1539
01:54:19,853 --> 01:54:23,017
Don't sleep on the mattress.
The snake will bite you. -Move.

1540
01:54:23,067 --> 01:54:26,391
Raju, I admit there is
a snake in my mattress.

1541
01:54:26,416 --> 01:54:28,358
But it's my pet snake.

1542
01:54:28,471 --> 01:54:30,169
My dear pet snake.

1543
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,039
I've kept it for 15 years
in my bed like my child.

1544
01:54:34,064 --> 01:54:35,459
Get up from the mattress! Get up!

1545
01:54:35,484 --> 01:54:37,973
What? You don't believe me?

1546
01:54:38,424 --> 01:54:41,605
You've insulted me, my holy snake!

1547
01:54:41,643 --> 01:54:43,464
Now I can't live in
this house for a moment!

1548
01:54:43,569 --> 01:54:46,649
I'm going along with my holy snake.

1549
01:54:46,674 --> 01:54:48,514
Far away from the society.

1550
01:54:48,649 --> 01:54:50,941
Mainawati, you shouldn't
live where there isn't peace.

1551
01:54:50,966 --> 01:54:52,046
Wait, uncle!

1552
01:54:53,106 --> 01:54:55,198
Pandu, come and take this mattress.

1553
01:54:55,237 --> 01:54:57,070
I'll not let you take the mattress!
No way! -Give it.

1554
01:54:57,095 --> 01:55:00,249
I won't leave it!
I won't let you open it! -Leave it!

1555
01:55:00,617 --> 01:55:02,687
Or else I'll blow your brains out!

1556
01:55:03,049 --> 01:55:04,911
My snake!

1557
01:55:04,952 --> 01:55:06,250
Scaring me with the gun!

1558
01:55:17,691 --> 01:55:20,928
I never thought you could
do such a lowly act.

1559
01:55:21,304 --> 01:55:24,366
If you're burned alive,
even that's too less a punishment.

1560
01:55:24,704 --> 01:55:28,117
And listen, from today you're
a servant and not the owner.

1561
01:55:28,142 --> 01:55:30,772
You'll work like the laborers
who work in our field.

1562
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:33,203
That's your punishment!

1563
01:55:33,233 --> 01:55:34,828
- I'll not work in the fields!
- Quiet!

1564
01:55:34,901 --> 01:55:37,861
I'll work in the fields!
But I've a small request!

1565
01:55:37,886 --> 01:55:41,646
What? -My wife was a
partner in this deed too.

1566
01:55:41,702 --> 01:55:44,251
- I want her to work in the fields too.
- Why not?!

1567
01:55:45,851 --> 01:55:47,797
You dare hit your husband.

1568
01:55:48,478 --> 01:55:50,038
I've kept all the money in this bag.

1569
01:55:50,544 --> 01:55:51,624
Give it to mother.

1570
01:55:55,287 --> 01:55:57,310
Wait! What are you doing?

1571
01:55:57,630 --> 01:55:59,172
Don't you have any sense?

1572
01:55:59,527 --> 01:56:02,461
By giving money to mother you're
endangering her life. You know that.

1573
01:56:02,694 --> 01:56:04,294
How is that?

1574
01:56:04,382 --> 01:56:05,532
You're so innocent.

1575
01:56:05,887 --> 01:56:08,207
Mother keeps the suitcase
near her head while sleeping.

1576
01:56:08,582 --> 01:56:10,954
What if someday uncle
gets wrong intentions...

1577
01:56:11,227 --> 01:56:14,094
...and he crushes mother's head
with a stone and steals the money?

1578
01:56:15,122 --> 01:56:16,132
You're right.

1579
01:56:16,212 --> 01:56:19,361
- Give this suitcase to Saru.
- Me?

1580
01:56:19,471 --> 01:56:21,118
- Who else?
- No.

1581
01:56:21,591 --> 01:56:23,631
This is risky work. You take care of it.

1582
01:56:24,834 --> 01:56:25,571
Fine.

1583
01:56:26,448 --> 01:56:27,930
Whatever you feel is fine.

1584
01:56:28,617 --> 01:56:31,422
If you say so, I'll take this risk too.

1585
01:56:32,635 --> 01:56:34,883
I can do anything for mother.

1586
01:56:36,304 --> 01:56:37,207
Right, Mother?

1587
01:56:49,598 --> 01:56:52,518
Congratulations,
I have to praise your plan.

1588
01:56:53,812 --> 01:56:54,887
You're very good at it.

1589
01:56:55,726 --> 01:56:57,529
I've learnt it from you, mother-in-law.

1590
01:56:59,294 --> 01:57:00,694
But remember one thing...

1591
01:57:02,294 --> 01:57:04,854
...I'm an old player of this game.

1592
01:57:06,462 --> 01:57:08,902
No one can compete with me.

1593
01:57:09,274 --> 01:57:11,791
Mother-in-law,
till now you were playing with amateurs.

1594
01:57:12,328 --> 01:57:16,226
You never come across
expert players like me.

1595
01:57:16,943 --> 01:57:18,859
Start worrying about your pawn.

1596
01:57:19,269 --> 01:57:22,942
You don't know what a
dangerous game you're playing.

1597
01:57:22,983 --> 01:57:25,743
Without danger there
is no fun in the game.

1598
01:57:26,423 --> 01:57:31,406
And I don't often get a chance
to play with players like you.

1599
01:57:32,684 --> 01:57:34,426
You like to play a lot?

1600
01:57:35,518 --> 01:57:36,638
Fine.

1601
01:57:37,069 --> 01:57:42,600
Tomorrow before 12 o'clock,
you'll give this money to me.

1602
01:57:44,642 --> 01:57:46,383
That's my challenge.

1603
01:57:53,822 --> 01:57:55,207
Madam, your telegram.

1604
01:57:55,286 --> 01:58:00,332
[BIRD CHIRPING]

1605
01:58:00,758 --> 01:58:01,878
Whose telegram is it?

1606
01:58:02,487 --> 01:58:04,317
Ramesh has been rusticated
from the college. -What?

1607
01:58:04,972 --> 01:58:07,976
Then how did he... What are you doing?
Don't leave home.

1608
01:58:08,001 --> 01:58:11,190
- No, daughter-in-law. Listen to me.
- Not at all!

1609
01:58:11,272 --> 01:58:12,873
I won't stay here another minute.

1610
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,977
My father isn't a poor man!

1611
01:58:15,146 --> 01:58:17,993
If I go to him,
he can do anything for my husband!

1612
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:20,479
Our honour is at stake.

1613
01:58:20,735 --> 01:58:22,295
I beg you!

1614
01:58:22,352 --> 01:58:23,912
Mother, what's going on?

1615
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:26,653
I'll tell you.
My husband has studied to be a doctor.

1616
01:58:27,038 --> 01:58:28,894
And he wants to build
a hospital in the city.

1617
01:58:29,374 --> 01:58:31,577
For that, I asked your mother for 600,000.

1618
01:58:31,777 --> 01:58:33,296
But do you know what your mother said?

1619
01:58:33,862 --> 01:58:35,764
She said this wealth belongs to Raju.

1620
01:58:35,798 --> 01:58:39,383
And his money can't be
given to anyone else!

1621
01:58:39,621 --> 01:58:41,440
Brother is the only successor
of this entire wealth.

1622
01:58:41,536 --> 01:58:44,671
Is brother the only successor of
this family? I'm the step-son.

1623
01:58:44,742 --> 01:58:46,210
What are you saying, Munna?

1624
01:58:46,718 --> 01:58:48,507
Mother must have said
this without thinking.

1625
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:50,067
But why are you saying that?

1626
01:58:50,813 --> 01:58:52,096
You want to build a hospital?

1627
01:58:52,378 --> 01:58:54,203
Tell me, how much money do you need?

1628
01:58:54,945 --> 01:58:56,590
- Rs.600,000.
- Fine.

1629
01:58:57,384 --> 01:58:58,301
- Saru.
- Yes?

1630
01:58:58,783 --> 01:59:00,832
I gave you money yesterday to keep safely.

1631
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:02,617
- Bring it.
- Yes.

1632
01:59:05,376 --> 01:59:07,656
Brother, I'll return your
money with interest...

1633
01:59:07,862 --> 01:59:09,702
...as soon as my hospital opens.

1634
01:59:09,895 --> 01:59:11,696
What did you say?

1635
01:59:11,991 --> 01:59:13,511
Don't be mad? I'm not a stranger.

1636
01:59:14,142 --> 01:59:15,942
Munna, everything belongs to us!

1637
01:59:16,512 --> 01:59:18,086
- Here.
- Give this money to Ramesh.

1638
01:59:19,502 --> 01:59:23,596
Brother, I'd like to take this
money from mother's lucky hands.

1639
01:59:23,684 --> 01:59:24,961
Yes, that's even better.

1640
01:59:25,126 --> 01:59:27,618
- Saru, give this suitcase to mother.
- Yes.

1641
01:59:40,517 --> 01:59:41,646
Just a minute.

1642
01:59:42,353 --> 01:59:43,740
Brother, what's the time?

1643
01:59:44,067 --> 01:59:45,702
Two seconds left for 12 o'clock.

1644
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:47,775
Give it, daughter-in-law.

1645
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:50,391
She's defeated.

1646
01:59:52,558 --> 01:59:54,398
Listen, can I say something?

1647
01:59:54,853 --> 01:59:56,527
Instead of opening a
hospital in the city...

1648
01:59:56,622 --> 02:00:00,182
...let's open a charitable dispensary
in the village in mother's name.

1649
02:00:00,295 --> 02:00:02,015
She'll be so honoured!

1650
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:04,094
Wow! How nice!

1651
02:00:04,644 --> 02:00:06,358
A charitable dispensary in mother's name.

1652
02:00:06,631 --> 02:00:08,015
Now that will happen.

1653
02:00:09,007 --> 02:00:10,167
Calm down!

1654
02:00:10,984 --> 02:00:12,424
My dear brothers and sisters!

1655
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,517
Today, we're going to lay...

1656
02:00:14,542 --> 02:00:16,947
...the foundation of a charitable
hospital in our village.

1657
02:00:17,383 --> 02:00:22,711
It'll be inaugurated by
my great mother-in-law.

1658
02:00:22,992 --> 02:00:26,373
And this hospital will be named after her!

1659
02:00:26,388 --> 02:00:28,559
Applause! Applause!

1660
02:00:28,643 --> 02:00:33,762
[APPLAUSE]

1661
02:00:34,703 --> 02:00:35,587
Give it.

1662
02:00:36,242 --> 02:00:38,940
And the second garland is for our doctor.

1663
02:00:39,052 --> 02:00:41,180
He'll treat you with his skilled hands.

1664
02:00:41,233 --> 02:00:43,353
I'm referring to my dear brother-in-law.

1665
02:00:43,535 --> 02:00:47,009
He studied day and night in the city.

1666
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:50,742
After receiving several degrees
he has come to rid your sorrows.

1667
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:53,024
Applause! Applause!

1668
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,259
Sister-in-law, this garland...

1669
02:00:55,284 --> 02:00:56,933
This is just the first
garland brother-in-law.

1670
02:00:57,071 --> 02:00:59,578
- You still have to wear a lot of garlands.
- What do you mean?

1671
02:00:59,667 --> 02:01:02,774
I mean, this garland marks
your victory brother-in-law.

1672
02:01:02,958 --> 02:01:04,081
Stop it!

1673
02:01:04,767 --> 02:01:07,532
Mainawati, do you see them
adorning him with garlands?

1674
02:01:08,121 --> 02:01:10,321
When I went to the
goddess's temple earlier...

1675
02:01:10,367 --> 02:01:12,453
...they were putting garlands on
the goats much in the same way...

1676
02:01:12,486 --> 02:01:14,673
...before they were sacrificed.

1677
02:01:14,836 --> 02:01:18,087
I feel there is something wrong.
Will they...

1678
02:01:19,961 --> 02:01:22,141
<i>- Inspector.
- The inspector is here.</i>

1679
02:01:22,243 --> 02:01:24,432
See, mother is so famous.

1680
02:01:24,587 --> 02:01:26,066
The hospital's foundation
has still not been laid...

1681
02:01:26,091 --> 02:01:28,118
...and the inspector has
come for the treatment.

1682
02:01:28,204 --> 02:01:29,696
Come, inspector.

1683
02:01:29,721 --> 02:01:31,813
Have sweets. You too, constable.

1684
02:01:31,849 --> 02:01:33,449
I haven't come here for sweets.

1685
02:01:33,572 --> 02:01:35,449
I'm on duty and I've
come here for a reason.

1686
02:01:35,665 --> 02:01:36,825
What's the reason, inspector?

1687
02:01:36,937 --> 02:01:41,137
Nothing special. I just want to
see your brother's medical degrees.

1688
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:42,905
You want to see his medical degrees!

1689
02:01:43,163 --> 02:01:47,077
Inspector, either you're mocking
my brother or insulting him.

1690
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,970
I'm just doing my duty.

1691
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:51,836
Ask your brother to show his degrees.

1692
02:01:51,871 --> 02:01:53,502
I'll be satisfied and leave.

1693
02:01:53,543 --> 02:01:56,016
You doubt my brother!

1694
02:01:56,063 --> 02:01:58,501
See... -There is no use in
blowing things out of proportion.!

1695
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:01,539
Ask your brother to show them his degrees.

1696
02:02:01,814 --> 02:02:04,439
You're right, Saru.
Ramesh, show them your degrees.

1697
02:02:06,587 --> 02:02:09,110
Inspector, just a minute.

1698
02:02:09,579 --> 02:02:10,056
Please.

1699
02:02:14,039 --> 02:02:16,657
Inspector, please don't blow
things out of proportion.

1700
02:02:16,822 --> 02:02:19,548
- If you want, you can take some money.
- What did you say?

1701
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:22,806
What are you doing?
Leave my brother's collar.

1702
02:02:22,978 --> 02:02:25,847
Why are you manhandling
him as if he was a thief?

1703
02:02:25,884 --> 02:02:27,839
Your brother deserves this!

1704
02:02:28,357 --> 02:02:31,165
As he's a conman and a cheat!
He was trying to bribe me.

1705
02:02:32,908 --> 02:02:36,287
You brother doesn't have any
degree and he's not a doctor!

1706
02:02:41,785 --> 02:02:43,399
How is that possible?

1707
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:47,418
My brother had brought a
suitcase full of degrees.

1708
02:02:47,773 --> 02:02:49,661
They must have been waste papers...

1709
02:02:49,686 --> 02:02:51,454
...which you get cheaply in the city.

1710
02:02:54,834 --> 02:02:56,748
Such a betrayal by my brother!

1711
02:02:58,781 --> 02:03:01,360
He shattered my mother's dreams.

1712
02:03:01,617 --> 02:03:03,814
I'm arresting him for posing as a doctor.

1713
02:03:03,839 --> 02:03:06,400
Don't do that. Please don't do it.

1714
02:03:06,848 --> 02:03:08,362
We'll be defamed.

1715
02:03:08,945 --> 02:03:10,931
My mother won't be able to face anyone.

1716
02:03:11,449 --> 02:03:14,352
I beg of you.

1717
02:03:14,798 --> 02:03:16,954
Please spare him for my mother's honour.

1718
02:03:17,738 --> 02:03:19,181
Let him off the hook.

1719
02:03:27,304 --> 02:03:29,211
I'll leave him today with just a warning.

1720
02:03:30,327 --> 02:03:33,874
But if he errs again,
the consequences will be grave.

1721
02:03:33,984 --> 02:03:37,030
Thank you very much!

1722
02:03:46,913 --> 02:03:48,286
Useless! Deceiver!

1723
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:51,016
You betrayed my mother!

1724
02:03:51,287 --> 02:03:53,385
- The entire village is taunting her!
- Raju.

1725
02:03:53,410 --> 02:03:54,512
Mocking her!

1726
02:03:54,843 --> 02:03:56,910
You betrayed her all her life.

1727
02:03:56,935 --> 02:03:58,256
You made her believe that you're a doctor.

1728
02:03:58,312 --> 02:04:00,897
- Raju, don't...
- Let it be, mother.

1729
02:04:01,025 --> 02:04:03,185
My brother-in-law can't
tolerate his beatings.

1730
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:06,359
If you beat him too,
he won't be able to tolerate it.

1731
02:04:06,384 --> 02:04:09,944
- Leave me.
- No. Let it be. Spare him.

1732
02:04:09,969 --> 02:04:11,049
Leave me.

1733
02:04:11,272 --> 02:04:13,030
Keep it.

1734
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:18,556
From today I want to see
you working in the fields!

1735
02:04:18,695 --> 02:04:21,179
Now go! What are you looking at? Go!

1736
02:04:21,243 --> 02:04:21,952
Go!

1737
02:04:22,542 --> 02:04:23,386
Raju!

1738
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:26,710
What about the money that you gave Ramesh!

1739
02:04:27,081 --> 02:04:28,328
Give it to Saru.

1740
02:04:30,155 --> 02:04:33,811
Daughter-in-law,
the game is getting very exciting.

1741
02:04:33,890 --> 02:04:36,421
One after the other, the opponent
is losing his pawns. -Yes, father.

1742
02:04:36,468 --> 02:04:39,734
Earlier it was a pawn,
but today a minister was defeated.

1743
02:04:46,252 --> 02:04:47,022
Sister!

1744
02:04:50,190 --> 02:04:52,579
How much more will you make us
work, brother-in-law?

1745
02:04:52,739 --> 02:04:56,063
It's dawn. Do you want to kill us?

1746
02:04:59,192 --> 02:05:01,132
Get up. Move.

1747
02:05:02,496 --> 02:05:05,407
Why did you bring me here?
I was well off in the city.

1748
02:05:06,392 --> 02:05:10,561
- I miss my mother.
- I miss my father.

1749
02:05:12,812 --> 02:05:15,530
Food is ready! Come here, gluttons.

1750
02:05:16,493 --> 02:05:18,053
Food!

1751
02:05:19,491 --> 02:05:21,789
Food has been served!

1752
02:05:23,536 --> 02:05:26,718
You get what you're destined for. Eat it!

1753
02:05:30,157 --> 02:05:32,324
Daughter-in-law, what did you do?
Our food.

1754
02:05:32,498 --> 02:05:33,733
This food isn't for you.

1755
02:05:33,837 --> 02:05:34,957
- Pandu!
- Here.

1756
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,366
Here is your food.

1757
02:05:37,748 --> 02:05:41,437
After toiling the entire day we
get this bread, chili and onion.

1758
02:05:41,522 --> 02:05:43,412
No, we don't want this food.

1759
02:05:43,437 --> 02:05:45,660
Fine, don't eat it. Go to hell.

1760
02:05:45,717 --> 02:05:48,829
I'll feed this food to Tommy. Tommy!

1761
02:05:50,219 --> 02:05:50,983
Eat it!

1762
02:05:51,624 --> 02:05:54,311
- Here.
- The dog is more fortunate than you.

1763
02:05:54,478 --> 02:05:57,035
Now you'll get food tomorrow afternoon.

1764
02:05:57,076 --> 02:05:58,556
Tomorrow afternoon!

1765
02:05:58,722 --> 02:06:02,044
- That means after 24 hours.
- I'll die!

1766
02:06:04,023 --> 02:06:06,108
Let us snatch it from the dog.

1767
02:06:06,511 --> 02:06:07,998
You dog!

1768
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:19,851
The pawn is gone, the minister is gone.

1769
02:06:20,053 --> 02:06:21,676
Now only the queen remains.

1770
02:06:21,779 --> 02:06:24,410
Once the queen is in our grasp, that's it.
Then check and mate.

1771
02:06:31,349 --> 02:06:32,418
Pandu!

1772
02:06:34,235 --> 02:06:36,551
- Pandu!
- Come on. Pandu!

1773
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:39,540
Where is he? Pandu!

1774
02:06:42,385 --> 02:06:44,460
Leave me! I say leave me!

1775
02:06:44,526 --> 02:06:47,941
We won't. We've caught
you with so difficultly.

1776
02:06:47,966 --> 02:06:49,043
Daughter-in-law, catch her tightly.

1777
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:52,644
Don't worry, father,
I've held her tightly.

1778
02:06:53,002 --> 02:06:54,547
- Leave me.
- Saru!

1779
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:57,235
- Why have you caught my mother?
- Son...

1780
02:06:57,299 --> 02:06:59,775
Blood! How is there blood?

1781
02:06:59,965 --> 02:07:01,308
- Nothing has happened to me, son.
- Mother, please lie down.

1782
02:07:01,389 --> 02:07:04,469
It's not right to speak in such a condition.
I'll tell you.

1783
02:07:04,837 --> 02:07:06,608
Mother was descending down the stairs.

1784
02:07:06,834 --> 02:07:08,449
Suddenly, she felt dizzy,
slipped and fell down.

1785
02:07:08,582 --> 02:07:10,566
It usually happens with
high blood pressure.

1786
02:07:10,606 --> 02:07:14,105
- High blood pressure!
- Yes, son. High blood pressure.

1787
02:07:14,342 --> 02:07:17,133
And it usually happens to
those who are arrogant.

1788
02:07:17,551 --> 02:07:20,329
- No, dear. Nothing happened to me.
- Nothing happened?

1789
02:07:20,779 --> 02:07:23,016
My friend's mother had the same ailment.

1790
02:07:23,457 --> 02:07:26,433
Because of her negligence,
she vomited blood 100 times.

1791
02:07:26,865 --> 02:07:28,608
She died such a terrible death.

1792
02:07:28,769 --> 02:07:31,490
- God save everyone from such a death.
- Don't say that, Saru.

1793
02:07:31,878 --> 02:07:34,528
She's right, mother.
Your life is very precious to me.

1794
02:07:34,672 --> 02:07:36,577
Lie down. I'll get the doctor.

1795
02:07:36,830 --> 02:07:37,950
- Listen!
- Yes.

1796
02:07:38,029 --> 02:07:40,509
You think we don't care for mother?

1797
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:42,519
We've already informed the doctor.

1798
02:07:42,654 --> 02:07:45,030

Come, doctor.

1801
02:07:54,415 --> 02:07:55,689
See what's happened to her.

1802
02:07:56,342 --> 02:07:58,472
- What has happened to you?
- Doctor, she's the patient.

1803
02:07:58,647 --> 02:08:00,944
She's the patient. Patient...

1804
02:08:03,655 --> 02:08:05,585
Oh, God!

1805
02:08:07,490 --> 02:08:09,945
Wrong! Terribly wrong! Do one thing.

1806
02:08:10,088 --> 02:08:14,143
Arrange for 2 bamboos, 2 meter cloth...

1807
02:08:14,201 --> 02:08:16,970
...a pot and fire.

1808
02:08:17,088 --> 02:08:20,008
- What are you saying, doctor?
- Wrong! Terribly wrong!

1809
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:23,374
Only prayers, no medication can help her.

1810
02:08:23,416 --> 02:08:26,920
- "Oh, God!"
- How could you say that?

1811
02:08:26,961 --> 02:08:28,079
First check her up.

02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:35,659
- What has happened to my sister?
- Sister! Who is this old man?

1815
02:08:35,729 --> 02:08:38,032
He's my uncle.
Uncle, look what has happened to mother.

1816
02:08:38,057 --> 02:08:39,561
- Sister.
- Quiet!

1817
02:08:39,663 --> 02:08:43,226
No noise. We don't have much time.
I should quickly start the treatment.

1818
02:08:53,489 --> 02:08:55,209
- Catch this.
- Give it to her.

02:09:09,889 --> 02:09:12,290
Doctor, what happened to him?
Seems like he has got epilepsy.

1822
02:09:12,315 --> 02:09:15,192
- Fine!
- What fine?

1823
02:09:15,217 --> 02:09:17,350
Oh, God, what has happened?

1824
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:19,952
Stop shaking.
I've switched off the current.

1825
02:09:20,607 --> 02:09:22,351
Don't you see what you've done to me?

1826
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:41,350
Her head is lit up with 440 volts.

1827
02:09:41,796 --> 02:09:46,171
That means this woman uses
her head a bit too much.

1828
02:09:46,196 --> 02:09:48,139
It's dangerous! Very dangerous!

1829
02:09:48,189 --> 02:09:51,029
Doctor, there must be some
treatment for it. -Sure.

1830
02:09:51,429 --> 02:09:54,943
She should be given
margosa leaves sherbet.

1831
02:09:54,984 --> 02:09:57,218
- Margosa leaves.
- Here.

1832
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:58,690

- No, Raju. I won't drink it.
- Drink it, mother.

- You'll be fine.
- Yes.

1835
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:04,459
It's very bitter. I can't drink it.

Mother, drink it for
your Raju's sake. -Yes.

It's my duty to try.
I've given her the medicine.

I have to give her injection.

1845

Doctor, this injection is quite big.

1846
02:10:39,936 --> 02:10:42,734
It's very effective too.

1847
02:10:42,774 --> 02:10:44,579
One day I injected a jenny.

- Give the keys.

02:12:23,758 --> 02:12:25,679
You're going to be a father?
That's fine but...

1886
02:12:26,405 --> 02:12:28,623
- What? I'm going to be a father?
- Yes.

1887
02:12:28,648 --> 02:12:31,764
Saru, I'm going to be a father! Mother!

1888
02:12:31,789 --> 02:12:34,190
I'm going to be a father!
You're going to be a granny.

1889
02:12:34,874 --> 02:12:38,436
Father, I'm going to be a father.

1890
02:12:38,461 --> 02:12:40,015
- Pandu!
- Yes, sir?

1891
02:12:55,484 --> 02:12:57,124
He has gone to the fields.

1892
02:12:57,380 --> 02:12:58,975
If there is any message for him, tell me.

1893
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,395
Ask Pandu to quickly
go to my father-in-law.

1894
02:13:01,543 --> 02:13:04,580
And give him this news.

1895
02:13:05,257 --> 02:13:05,900
Yes, sir.

1896
02:13:06,604 --> 02:13:08,415
Saru!

1897
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:13,660
What are you doing?

1898
02:13:15,713 --> 02:13:17,437
[GRUNTS]

1899
02:13:17,462 --> 02:13:18,837
What is this, doctor?
What has happened to her?

1900
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:20,467
What are you doing?

1901
02:13:20,509 --> 02:13:22,017
What has happened?

1902
02:13:24,204 --> 02:13:25,796
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

1903
02:13:26,065 --> 02:13:27,582
Seems like my injection is taking effect.

1904
02:13:27,607 --> 02:13:29,539
In three to four hours
she'll win the race.

1905
02:13:29,564 --> 02:13:30,796
Doctor!

1906
02:13:31,194 --> 02:13:33,493
Mainawati!

1907
02:13:34,431 --> 02:13:35,511
Ramdas, what has happened?

1908
02:13:35,576 --> 02:13:38,071
Sir, the clutch plate and
fuel pump isn't working.

1909
02:13:38,073 --> 02:13:41,142
Oh God, now how will we
plough the field in a day?

1910
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:42,379
Pandu, listen.

1911
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:44,445
Let's buy the tractor
parts from the city. -Yes.

1912
02:13:44,897 --> 02:13:46,160
- Champa.
- Yes.

1913
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:49,012
Tell everyone we'll
return tomorrow morning.

1914
02:13:49,046 --> 02:13:50,555
- Okay.
- Bye.

1915
02:13:53,678 --> 02:13:56,664
Bye. I'm getting late. I'll come again.

1916
02:13:56,935 --> 02:13:59,387
And yes, I've brought
all this for all of you.

1917
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:01,422
And this saffron for Saru.

1918
02:14:01,431 --> 02:14:02,551
Why saffron?

1919
02:14:02,943 --> 02:14:04,579
Brother, our ancestors say...

1920
02:14:04,604 --> 02:14:07,884
...if a pregnant woman drinks
saffron mixed in milk...

1921
02:14:07,909 --> 02:14:10,832
...the child born is fair and beautiful.

1922
02:14:10,983 --> 02:14:13,868
Ask her to mix it in milk
everyday and drink it. -Yes.

1923
02:14:13,892 --> 02:14:15,444
I'll leave now.
- Yes. Good bye. - Good bye.

1924
02:14:22,862 --> 02:14:24,214
Come on, start.

1925
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:26,882
After a long time,
we've got sweets to eat.

1926
02:14:28,651 --> 02:14:29,946
Have patience, brother!

1927
02:14:31,606 --> 02:14:34,652
Sister, if Saru arrives we'll
not get to eat all this.

1928
02:14:34,693 --> 02:14:37,718
- Again, millet bread and vegetable.
- Listen to me first.

1929
02:14:40,687 --> 02:14:41,916
- Ramesh.
- Yes, mother.

1930
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:44,108
Take the key...

1931
02:14:44,636 --> 02:14:48,461
...and bring the poison
bottle from my cupboard. -Yes.

1932
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:51,156
Sister, why are you asking
for the poison bottle?

1933
02:14:51,239 --> 02:14:53,079
Do you want us to commit suicide?

1934
02:14:54,971 --> 02:14:58,130
Brother, didn't you ask me
what my last move will be?

1935
02:14:59,330 --> 02:15:01,610
- This will be my last move.
- I didn't understand you.

1936
02:15:03,007 --> 02:15:04,750
The situation has gone out of control.

1937
02:15:05,700 --> 02:15:09,002
Now either she'll live
in this house or me!

1938
02:15:09,064 --> 02:15:09,856
Absolutely right.

1939
02:15:10,328 --> 02:15:12,625
Now that you've taken the
step, don't retreat!

1940
02:15:12,666 --> 02:15:14,305
Her death is our life!

1941
02:15:14,754 --> 02:15:15,533
Here, Mother.

1942
02:15:31,257 --> 02:15:33,211
She wanted to compete with me.

1943
02:15:34,830 --> 02:15:36,909
She doesn't know that I like a serpent.

1944
02:15:38,203 --> 02:15:41,210
And a serpent devours her own children!

1945
02:15:42,897 --> 02:15:46,273
Then how can I spare you and your child?

1946
02:15:55,179 --> 02:15:56,842
- Raju.
- Yes, Mother.

1947
02:15:57,328 --> 02:16:00,742
Saru's mother isn't alive.
And this is her first child.

1948
02:16:01,202 --> 02:16:03,171
So we'll have to take care of her.

1949
02:16:03,561 --> 02:16:06,671
Her father came today
and gave this saffron.

1950
02:16:07,265 --> 02:16:09,468
Mix it in the milk and make her drink it.

1951
02:16:09,982 --> 02:16:10,992
What for?

1952
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:14,288
So that the child that's
born is fair and beautiful.

1953
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:16,530
Really? Then I'll make
her drink it right away.

1954
02:16:24,351 --> 02:16:25,546
Saru, look what I have...

1955
02:16:26,983 --> 02:16:29,451
What are you doing?
And that too in this condition.

1956
02:16:29,484 --> 02:16:30,564
Come down.

1957
02:16:34,163 --> 02:16:36,664
Why have you put up
such a big snap of mine?

1958
02:16:37,188 --> 02:16:38,320
It's a secret.

1959
02:16:38,876 --> 02:16:41,343
First take me in your
arms, then I'll tell you.

1960
02:16:42,101 --> 02:16:43,402
Here.

1961
02:16:44,084 --> 02:16:48,506
It's said that the child
resembles the person whose face...

1962
02:16:48,736 --> 02:16:51,513
...a pregnant lady always sees.

1963
02:16:52,115 --> 02:16:53,446
- Really?
- Yes.

1964
02:16:53,818 --> 02:16:55,868
And so I've put up your snap.

1965
02:16:56,772 --> 02:17:00,000
So that your face is
always in front of me...

1966
02:17:01,053 --> 02:17:06,507
...and in a few days a small
Raju is born just like you.

1967
02:17:06,991 --> 02:17:09,571
Then remove this photo
and put up your snap.

1968
02:17:09,596 --> 02:17:11,446
- Why?
- Because it'll be a girl first.

1969
02:17:11,878 --> 02:17:15,554
- It'll be a boy.
- I'm telling you, it's a girl.

1970
02:17:15,572 --> 02:17:17,383
- It'll be a boy.
- It'll be a girl.

1971
02:17:18,001 --> 02:17:19,081
What is this?

1972
02:17:19,358 --> 02:17:21,835
Saffron! Oh, where is the milk?

1973
02:17:21,892 --> 02:17:23,332
Where are you going?

1974
02:17:23,357 --> 02:17:25,237
Your father gave this saffron.

1975
02:17:25,773 --> 02:17:28,905
He said that if you drink
this saffron mixed in milk...

1976
02:17:29,171 --> 02:17:32,125
...the child born will
be fair and beautiful.

1977
02:17:32,835 --> 02:17:36,233
Drink the milk before it cools down.

1978
02:17:37,564 --> 02:17:38,774
Just a minute!

1979
02:17:39,339 --> 02:17:42,938
I'll add more saffron so
that the baby is very fair.

1980
02:17:42,978 --> 02:17:45,247
Enough! This saffron is
for the entire month.

1981
02:17:45,343 --> 02:17:46,550
Do you want to finish it today?

1982
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:49,115
If it's finished, I'll get more.
Drink the milk quickly.

1983
02:17:49,832 --> 02:17:50,988
Feed me.

1984
02:17:51,861 --> 02:17:53,187
I'll feed you.

1985
02:18:06,589 --> 02:18:07,742
What happened?

1986
02:18:09,993 --> 02:18:12,553
I'm drinking this saffron
milk for the first time.

1987
02:18:12,643 --> 02:18:14,257
I'll bow in front of God.

1988
02:18:16,787 --> 02:18:17,867
What's the matter, Champa?

1989
02:18:18,171 --> 02:18:19,809
Why did you stop me?

1990
02:18:19,834 --> 02:18:22,876
Sister, the saffron milk that
you were going to drink...

1991
02:18:23,184 --> 02:18:24,406
...contains poison.

1992
02:18:25,689 --> 02:18:27,564
What? Poison!

1993
02:18:27,612 --> 02:18:31,098
Yes, I saw madam mixing poison in it.

1994
02:18:33,601 --> 02:18:34,226
No.

1995
02:18:36,749 --> 02:18:39,375
- That can't be.
- It has happened.

1996
02:18:39,446 --> 02:18:43,038
I swear on my husband, it has happened!

1997
02:18:49,276 --> 02:18:50,724
Saru, what happened?

1998
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:53,283
Have you finished your veneration?

1999
02:18:53,333 --> 02:18:55,013
Come quickly. The milk is getting cold.

2000
02:18:57,396 --> 02:18:58,486
Have you finished the veneration...

2001
02:19:13,109 --> 02:19:13,939
Here.

2002
02:19:14,423 --> 02:19:17,270
What is the matter? What is this for?

2003
02:19:17,682 --> 02:19:19,175
I'd like to die by the
hands of my husband...

2004
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,243
...rather than being
poisoned by someone else.

2005
02:19:22,845 --> 02:19:24,370
Take it and kill me!

2006
02:19:24,417 --> 02:19:26,221
What has happened to you suddenly?

2007
02:19:26,628 --> 02:19:30,828
You had mixed saffron in the milk!
There is poison in that saffron!

2008
02:19:32,234 --> 02:19:35,968
Poison! What nonsense?!
There is poison in the saffron!

2009
02:19:36,226 --> 02:19:38,429
Your father had given this saffron.

2010
02:19:38,653 --> 02:19:40,023
Why would he poison her daughter?

2011
02:19:40,305 --> 02:19:42,508
My father had only given the saffron.

2012
02:19:43,101 --> 02:19:45,882
But your mother added poison in it!

2013
02:19:49,061 --> 02:19:50,696
My mother mixed poison in the milk!

2014
02:19:51,758 --> 02:19:53,127
Are you out of your mind, Saru?

2015
02:19:53,970 --> 02:19:57,359
Don't say that!
I'll have to punish you for it!

2016
02:19:57,384 --> 02:19:59,899
You can even kill me if you want!

2017
02:20:00,126 --> 02:20:02,656
Because I knew you'd never believe me!

2018
02:20:02,762 --> 02:20:05,391
- Pick up this axe and kill me.
- Saru.

2019
02:20:06,103 --> 02:20:08,741
Don't accuse my mother
of such a grave crime.

2020
02:20:08,974 --> 02:20:10,711
Don't accuse her!

2021
02:20:14,934 --> 02:20:18,928
Before my mother becomes a
murderer, the sky will fall...

2022
02:20:19,277 --> 02:20:21,342
...sun and the moon will
change their course!

2023
02:20:21,509 --> 02:20:23,829
The Earth will change its position!

2024
02:20:24,096 --> 02:20:26,094
But all of them are in their place.

2025
02:20:26,391 --> 02:20:29,671
That proves everything you said is a lie!

2026
02:20:29,828 --> 02:20:32,350
You're lying!

2027
02:20:33,227 --> 02:20:34,375
I'm lying!

2028
02:20:35,206 --> 02:20:38,953
If I'm lying, my unborn child will die!

2029
02:20:47,575 --> 02:20:51,449
If you strongly believe in
it, my faith is unshakeable!

2030
02:20:51,993 --> 02:20:54,086
Now we have to prove...

2031
02:20:54,847 --> 02:20:56,358
...whether this milk is poisoned or not.

2032
02:20:57,281 --> 02:20:59,238
There is no need for mother to prove it.

2033
02:21:00,151 --> 02:21:01,672
I'll drink this milk and do it.

2034
02:21:01,935 --> 02:21:02,802
No!

2035
02:21:11,591 --> 02:21:13,569
No! What have you done?

2036
02:21:14,103 --> 02:21:16,138
I became the reason for your death!

2037
02:21:16,170 --> 02:21:19,463
If I knew you would drink the
milk, I would've drunk it!

2038
02:21:19,798 --> 02:21:21,030
What shall I do now?

2039
02:21:21,503 --> 02:21:23,333
Come with me to the doctor!

2040
02:21:23,767 --> 02:21:26,991
- Come, I'll take you to the doctor.
- Leave me!

2041
02:21:27,658 --> 02:21:29,297
You can go to the doctor if you want to!

2042
02:21:29,930 --> 02:21:31,537
Nothing has happened to me.
I'll be fine here.

2043
02:21:31,562 --> 02:21:33,684
Oh God! What should I do? Where can I go?!

2044
02:21:33,709 --> 02:21:35,817
Father!

2045
02:21:37,351 --> 02:21:39,609
Witch, tell him!

2046
02:21:39,775 --> 02:21:41,618
Tell him there was poison in the milk!

2047
02:21:41,787 --> 02:21:43,503
Or else my Raju won't survive!

2048
02:21:44,412 --> 02:21:46,349
Murderer, why are you standing quietly?

2049
02:21:46,383 --> 02:21:48,974
Tell him there was poison in the milk!

2050
02:21:49,741 --> 02:21:52,060
Don't dare say anything against my mother!

2051
02:21:52,382 --> 02:21:53,570
I'll kill you!

2052
02:21:54,054 --> 02:21:55,285
I...

2053
02:21:56,468 --> 02:21:57,943
I'll call the doctor!

2054
02:22:00,576 --> 02:22:02,615
