Oh no!

4
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,435
You're out of tune.
Completely out of tune.

5
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:28,437
- What's up, Maestro? - A lifeless
voice can't sing in tune.

6
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,814
Sounds like she has a sore throat.

7
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:35,279
- What's wrong, Kiran?
- She needn't say. I know it all.

8
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,817
All these girls do nowadays
is to roam till late...

9
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:41,118
... at nights with friends.
She has shouted her voice hoarse.

10
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,059
And they'll eat whatever they like.
ls that a sign of love for music?

11
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:48,456
- That's going to get you nowhere.
- Please do not say so, maestro.

12
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:52,762
Tell us Kiran, d'you or don't you
want to master classical music?

13
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:56,469
You must devote yourself
completely to your lessons.

14
00:02:57,575 --> 00:03:03,343
I'll be back after a few days.
Get over the sore throat by then.

15
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:06,711
Greetings, Sir.

16
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,452
- Does he have a problem with me?
- Never mind the daily dramatics.

17
00:03:13,824 --> 00:03:15,883
Have you got the tickets
to the New Year's party?

18
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:57,490
<i>I come before you, friends,
after giving my heart away,</i>

19
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:05,480
<i>with someone's face
before my eyes.</i>

20
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:12,490
<i>My beloved is the
killer of my heart.</i>

21
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,290
<i>I've become like
a vagabond for her.</i>

22
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,290
<i>She kissed me right
when she saw me,</i>

23
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,290
<i>but didn't look
back as she left.</i>

24
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,290
<i>And therefore, my
friends, I decided that...</i>

25
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,290
<i>I won't ever fall in love again.</i>

26
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,280
<i>Never again will I give
my heart to some girl.</i>

27
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,290
<i>She's given me such a
wound that it will never heal.</i>

28
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,290
<i>Now my heart will fear
every beautiful face.</i>

29
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,280
<i>I gave my soul and was wiped out.</i>

30
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,280
<i>Listen up, beauties,
this won't happen again!</i>

31
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,290
<i>Such a wound she's given me!</i>

32
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,290
<i>Juicy lips, cheeks that
beckon to the touch...</i>

33
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,290
<i>A sensuous gait,
that destroys a man.</i>

34
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,280
<i>Widened eyes... my heart races.</i>

35
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,280
<i>The ripeness of youth is
a fearsome force!</i>

36
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,290
<i>Deadly beauty,
poisonous coyness.</i>

37
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,280
<i>Oh my God, oh my God!</i>

38
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,290
<i>A beautiful body, a swaying
flower, but friends...</i>

39
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,290
<i>I gave my soul and was wiped out.</i>

40
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,290
<i>Listen up, beauties,
this won't happen again!</i>

41
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,290
<i>Such a wound she's given me!</i>

42
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,290
<i>Juicy lips, cheeks that
beckon to the touch...</i>

43
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,290
<i>A sensuous gait,
that destroys a man.</i>

44
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,290
<i>Widened eyes... my heart races.</i>

45
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,290
<i>The ripeness of youth is
a fearsome force!</i>

46
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,290
<i>Deadly beauty,
poisonous coyness.</i>

47
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,290
<i>Oh my God, oh my God!</i>

48
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,290
<i>If you asked me,
I would bring you the stars.</i>

49
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,280
<i>If you asked me,
I would spread them at your feet.</i>

50
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,290
<i>Embracing you, I would
make your body blush.</i>

51
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,290
<i>Kissing your face, I'd
light you up like the sun.</i>

52
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,290
<i>I gave you my soul and was wiped out.</i>

53
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,290
<i>Who is going to love you so much?</i>

54
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,290
<i>You've given me such a
wound that it will never heal.</i>

55
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,290
<i>Now my heart will fear
every beautiful face.</i>

56
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,290
<i>Such a wound you have given me!</i>

57
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:31,290
<i>I come before you, friends,
after giving my heart away,</i>

58
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,290
<i>with someone's face
before my eyes.</i>

59
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:46,290
<i>No one else will be mine.</i>

60
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,290
<i>For this very reason, (my pain)
must somehow remain hidden.</i>

61
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:10,163
A pack of biscuits and a bread.
Need anything more?

62
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,440
- No thanks. How much was that?
- Fifteen bucks.

63
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,209
Rohit Kumar, your neighbor upstairs,
screams his head off all day.

64
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:23,514
- Aren't your ears sore already?
- That's him rehearsing music.

65
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,550
And he loves music. Besides,
l am not irked to complain.

66
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,257
For God's sake!

67
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:35,965
How come you're so busy with your
accounts so early in the morning?

68
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:39,358
- Won't you sit down to a cuppa?
- Woe beside!

69
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:43,365
Rohit Kumar hasn't paid
me in 3 months now.

70
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,571
He gets me to make him new
dresses every now and then.

71
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:47,901
But just doesn't bother
to pay for the stitching.

72
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:51,305
He owes me a large sum too.
But I just can't complain.

73
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,018
Hey Kanhaiya! Come over
for a cup of tea.

74
00:10:57,354 --> 00:10:58,912
Give it a rev.

75
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:05,989
It's all your fault.

76
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,958
You've given the house to a
tuppence worth of a singer on rent.

77
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:11,332
All you have for yourself
is a room in the backyard.

78
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:18,439
- Has he paid the rents yet? - He'll
pay up in due course. Fine fellow.

79
00:11:18,942 --> 00:11:19,909
How are you, Rohit?

80
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:25,040
- Come over here, Qasim.
- ln a moment.

81
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:27,147
- I'm ravenous.
- What can I get you?

82
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:31,988
-2 fried eggs, buttered toasts, jam,
a special cup of tea. - Coming up.

83
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:36,688
Hello, Mr. Jamshed.
How d'you do?

84
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:39,689
- Forget niceties. Talk cash. - Some
bills are due for a couple of months.

85
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,422
Today's the first of the month.
I'll settle everything by the 30th.

86
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,867
Very well... er... what
did you say? By the 30th?

87
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:49,362
- Exactly. How many days between
the 30th and the first? - One day.

88
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:53,700
- There you are. - The number of
days between the 1st and the 30th...

89
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:56,445
- He's making a fool out of Jamshed.
- That's right.

90
00:11:56,713 --> 00:12:00,149
Didn't you have a show last night?
How did it go?

91
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,716
- It was a riot! - Was it then?!
- The crowd went berserk as I sang.

92
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:08,588
And the girls were crazy about me.

93
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,895
There was this girl
who caught my eye.

94
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,523
She has beautiful eyes
and a pretty face.

95
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:21,436
- Fabulous! What happened later?
- She left after the program ended.

96
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:27,409
If she comes into my life, I'll
write the best songs on earth.

97
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:32,111
Dream you may.
But everyone cannot become Elvis.

98
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:37,120
Shut up Moolchand. You're a grocer.
What d'you know about music?

99
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:42,856
Someday Rohit Kumar will make the
greatest singer in our country.

100
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:01,866
No one even bothers to listen.

101
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:11,648
Look... it's Mehra. He's counting
the proceeds of the show last night.

102
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:16,617
- He made 50 to 60,000 last night.
- And we don't get a penny of it.

103
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:23,994
Happy New Year, Mr. Mehra.

104
00:13:26,103 --> 00:13:29,732
What's so special about a New Year?
Just another day and another night.

105
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:32,735
Oh yes. But it was a grand
show last night, wasn't it?

106
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:35,838
- Well, average, I'd say.
- Average, d'you say? About that.

107
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:38,346
There! Look at the pile you made
last night. What are you up to?!

108
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:44,351
It's all because of me, Sir.
People come here to hear me sing.

109
00:13:44,855 --> 00:13:47,619
- That's how you sake in the moolah.
- D'you take yourself for a star...

110
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:51,550
... just because I've put up
a couple of your portraits?

111
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:56,162
- You see, Sir. I am...
- You should be grateful to me!

112
00:13:56,566 --> 00:14:00,696
Grateful for letting you sing
before such a large gathering!

113
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:05,538
Minstrels like you roam the
streets a dime-a-dozen.

114
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:07,475
And no one would even
care to give you tuppence.

115
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,737
You ingrate!

116
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:19,682
How dare you misbehave! You come
here to sing. Not to chase girls!

117
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:21,991
I'm not chasing her, Sir.
l was just...

118
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:31,297
- I'm responsible for the harangue.
- It's a part of my daily diet.

119
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,194
Now, what's it you were saying?

120
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:37,531
- I'd like to learn how to
sing from you. - From me?!

121
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:47,982
And, you wrote such a beautiful
song. I'm crazy about your song.

122
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:49,578
I can't think of anything else.

123
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:57,591
I couldn't sleep last night after
your show. I kept humming the tune.

124
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:03,893
- Neither did I sleep after
the show last night. - Why?

125
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:07,832
It is a new tune that
kept me up all the night.

126
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,203
Would you like to hear it?

127
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,660
<i>The king fell in
love with the queen...</i>

128
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,670
<i>It was first love
at first sight.</i>

129
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,660
<i>The hearts of both were wounded...</i>

130
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,660
<i>by an arrowed glance,
that breached the hearts' walls.</i>

131
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,670
<i>The king fell in
love with the queen.</i>

132
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,136
Such a beautiful song!

133
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:25,642
Songs like that are what I'd like
to sing. Not the classicals.

134
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:27,983
Please teach me how to
sing a song like that.

135
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:29,842
I'll work hard at it.

136
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,670
<i>The king fell in
love with the queen.</i>

137
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,670
<i>It was first love
at first sight.</i>

138
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,670
<i>The hearts of both were wounded...</i>

139
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,520
<i>by an arrowed glance,
that breached the hearts' walls.</i>

140
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,670
<i>The king fell in
love with the queen...</i>

141
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,660
<i>Sometimes you meet
someone on the paths of love...</i>

142
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,670
<i>but it's not assured
that love will flourish.</i>

143
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,670
<i>Often the buds of desire...</i>

144
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,670
<i>are cut short before blooming.</i>

145
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:09,670
<i>Even so, who knows
why he did not agree...</i>

146
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,670
<i>His crazy heart
grew uncontrollably restless.</i>

147
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,670
<i>The king fell in
love with the queen.</i>

148
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,430
<i>He looked at the queen,
and met her gaze...</i>

149
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,670
<i>She looked away...</i>

150
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,670
<i>What else could she do?</i>

151
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,670
<i>She looked down...</i>

152
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,670
<i>and played with her bracelet.</i>

153
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:49,660
<i>The king cast such a spell...</i>

154
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,660
<i>that she eventually
reciprocated his love.</i>

155
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:34,479
Why don't we get married, Kiran?

156
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:37,158
What?!

157
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:44,956
I've never thought about it.

158
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:51,703
- I've only think about one thing.
- What?

159
00:21:52,675 --> 00:22:00,275
Music and my career. I want to make
the greatest singer of the land.

160
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,349
- That'll be difficult.
- Why?

161
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:08,182
Because that status has been booked
for me a long while ago.

162
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:18,358
What could be better for both of us?

163
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:25,966
We travel towards same goals. And
we could reach our goal together.

164
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,708
Tell me... will you marry me?

165
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:34,847
What brings you here?

166
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:40,649
- He's a famous singer. - I see.
So you are a singer, are you?

167
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:43,992
Actually, I'm a composer.

168
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:47,558
I write the songs I sing.

169
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,928
Classicals?

170
00:22:49,265 --> 00:22:55,397
- Not classicals. I sing
lighter tunes. - How light?

171
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,135
- I don't think you understand.
- Please help me too.

172
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:03,344
I sing songs that strike a chord
in the heart.

173
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:06,278
And where do you sing such songs?

174
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,278
- Presently, I sing at a hotel.
- At a hotel?

175
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:16,447
One might as well sing at a hotel
as go around with a begging bowl.

176
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:20,726
As with wandering minstrels who
collect pence in tips if at all.

177
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:24,330
Enough. I have not come here
to discuss my careers.

178
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:25,897
So, what brings you here?

179
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,832
Excuse me, Kiran.

180
00:23:33,343 --> 00:23:36,107
Stop, Rohit!

181
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:38,043
Listen to me...

182
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:49,213
I didn't invite Rohit so you
might insult him.

183
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:55,091
D'you take me for a fool? A look at
him and I know why you invited him.

184
00:23:55,631 --> 00:23:59,294
Stop being foolish. Your marriage
has already been fixed.

185
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:08,676
- I'm in love with Rohit.
- Do you hear what she says?

186
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,680
You must consider the consequences.
This is not done.

187
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:19,682
The upbringing and education I've
given her all these years are a waste!

188
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:22,349
If you think so highly about my
upbringing and my education,...

189
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,784
... you should respect
my decisions too.

190
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:28,956
I have a feeling that he's a
cunning fellow. He's ensnaring you.

191
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,999
- You're still an innocent girl.
- I'm no innocent, mother.

192
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:35,996
And what does that make of you?

193
00:24:36,305 --> 00:24:40,173
I'm an artist. And, he's an artist
too. You can't gauge our sentiments.

194
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:46,648
Don't I understand? An artist
my foot! A Bremen-town musician!

195
00:24:46,816 --> 00:24:48,800
A good for nothing vagabond! And she
wants to marry him!

196
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,785
You'll get to know about
the realities in life in no time!

197
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:54,648
Don't you come back crying later on.
Our doors will have closed for you.

198
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:04,399
Just as well that you told me all
this. It'll help me take my decision.

199
00:25:05,468 --> 00:25:07,026
I'm going to marry Rohit.

200
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:29,082
- I'll floor them at the audition
today. - May I accompany you?

201
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:30,843
It'll take me 2 minutes
to get dressed.

202
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:34,385
lsn't the plumber expected in today?

203
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,353
See you. Bye.

204
00:27:21,203 --> 00:27:23,603
How are you going to climb four
stories in the condition you are?

205
00:27:23,973 --> 00:27:26,503
But, this is your first recording.
And I wanted to be there with you.

206
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:29,102
I'm not recording for a film. Its
just a jingle for an advertisement.

207
00:27:30,346 --> 00:27:32,780
When am I going to meet the right
people? When will I start working?

208
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:38,580
It's just a matter of a few more
months. What makes you so upright?

209
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:26,557
- Hello, Farida. Come in.
- What are you doing?

210
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:27,826
Nothing much. Just cooking.

211
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:31,705
- Like a cup of tea? - Why not?
- ls the tea brewed? - Yes.

212
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:34,499
I haven't seen you
around in 4 or 5 days.

213
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,406
- Have you been keeping well?
- Absolutely.

214
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:44,385
- What's the matter? You seem tense.
- Not at all. I'm perfectly fine.

215
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:48,882
How are your music
rehearsals going on?

216
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:54,053
l hardly find time outside household
chores. How am I to rehearse?

217
00:28:55,865 --> 00:29:00,131
What of the career in music? Can you
immerse yourself so in the chores?

218
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,864
You must carve out some time
everyday for rehearsing.

219
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,273
Look at me... I must fetch Sonu
from school after I finish cooking.

220
00:29:09,612 --> 00:29:12,638
I'll go and fetch Sonu... Yes. l
will. It doesn't really matter.

221
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:21,287
Will you please draw a bath for me?
Make it fast. I've to attend a party.

222
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:24,688
- What party? - Oh, there's
something I'd like you to know.

223
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,418
- I've dumped the job.
- Why?

224
00:29:28,964 --> 00:29:33,196
l had enough of Mehra's abuses.
Besides, I want to move upwards.

225
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:39,000
- What's more, I met Gulbadan
Kumar today. - Gulbadan Kumar?!

226
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:42,673
Yes. He owns Prince Records. Its
really tough to get to meet him.

227
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,343
I walked into his office and sang
a few songs. He liked my voice.

228
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:53,317
He invited me to the party this
evening. Looks like I've made it.

229
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:57,253
- Just press these clothes for me,
will you? - I'm coming with you!

230
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,028
- What'll you do there? You'd get
bored. - No. I won't get bored.

231
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:03,559
- What about Sonu?
- Farida can put him to sleep.

232
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,567
All right. You can come along.
Get dressed in some good clothes.

233
00:30:07,803 --> 00:30:09,737
Now. Take the clothes.
Press them quickly.

234
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:18,446
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan Kumar.
Ever since your company was formed...

235
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:23,318
-... music sales have grown manifold.
-It's the grace of The Divine Mother.

236
00:30:26,455 --> 00:30:29,982
A double gold disc for the music
directors. Someday I'll get mine too.

237
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:36,489
l've recorded my voice on
a cassette... Rohit...!

238
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,797
l've recorded one of
my songs in a cassette.

239
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:44,337
- Will you please give it
to Gulbadan Kumar? - All right.

240
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:51,202
Hows the good lady? I greet you
in the name of The Divine Mother.

241
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:55,345
- Hello. - I'm Rohit Kumar.
- Of course, Mr. Rohit Kumar.

242
00:30:55,718 --> 00:30:57,811
- Greetings! - Grand party.
- It's modest really.

243
00:30:58,854 --> 00:31:02,756
- Have you listened to my cassette?
- Yes I did. - Did you like it?

244
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:06,018
- Very nice.
- Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Sir.

245
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,163
Glory be to The Divine Mother!

246
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:17,330
Congratulations, Mr. Gulbadan!
You're raking in gold discs.

247
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,105
Let's pose for a photograph.

248
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,974
- You're the biggest of them all.
- Not at all. - lsn't it, now?

249
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:30,315
It's the two of you, Messrs Amar &
Kaushik who are the most well known.

250
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:35,488
That's the magic of our music.
We've defined 6 super hit films.

251
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:38,587
- Our critics are now silenced.
- lndeed. lndeed, Mr. Gulbadan.

252
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:41,963
You must listen to the music
we've scored for our next film.

253
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:44,825
- The Divine Mother be praised. - We
recorded a song yesterday. Beautiful!

254
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:48,163
Which film is the song meant for?

255
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:52,938
Well... he's an upcoming artiste.
He's also a singer.

256
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:56,139
- Mr. Rahul Kumar.
- I'm Rohit Kumar, Sir.

257
00:31:56,512 --> 00:31:57,843
Oh yes,... Mr. Rohit Kumar.

258
00:31:58,214 --> 00:31:59,681
- Do you sing?
- Yes, Sir.

259
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:02,173
I see. For whom
have you sung till now?

260
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:08,551
- Nothing special yet. - Yes. Go on.
- I want to sing for you.- Of course.

261
00:32:10,492 --> 00:32:13,592
- Don't forget to give my cassette.
- Oh yes. But, stop it now, will you?

262
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:16,860
- Yes... what is it?
- I'm not only a singer.

263
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:18,758
l've written a few songs too.

264
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,467
- And what are you?!
- A composer.

265
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:27,173
ln a country like ours, just
about anyone can turn a composer.

266
00:32:29,044 --> 00:32:34,607
Call me up on Monday. If your
voice is worth it, you're made.

267
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,212
I'll come over on Monday
after giving you a call.

268
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,149
What more could you want?
Glory be to The Divine Mother.

269
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,652
- Mr. Gulbadan...
- Yes, Sir.

270
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:43,919
Why aren't you giving
him my cassette?

271
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:45,987
- I can't give the cassette now.
- Why?

272
00:32:46,028 --> 00:32:49,020
- It was so difficult getting an
audition for myself. - So what?

273
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:51,729
How can I ask them to
audition my wife too?

274
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,399
They'll think I'm trying to
force my family down their throats.

275
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:18,488
- So, d'you feel that I'm imposing
myself upon you? - I never said that.

276
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:23,592
- That's what you meant! - I'm tired
and I don't want to get into a fight.

277
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:25,594
D'you mean to say that l
want to get into a fight?

278
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:26,462
Sonu is sleeping.

279
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:34,537
l'd only asked you to hand over
my cassette. Was it so difficult?

280
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:40,212
I haven't heard what you've recorded.
I don't even know what's in it.

281
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:43,518
I don't know if it's worth a hearing.
And, it was tough getting an audition.

282
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:46,354
Must I lose a chance by trying
to push your cassette?

283
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:53,452
An hour ago, you loved my voice.
Now, it isn't worth auditioning!

284
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:56,189
I don't mean that. One must practice
regularly to be able to sing properly.

285
00:33:56,465 --> 00:34:00,834
Just another excuse! And I think l
understand you perfectly, Rohit.

286
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:05,771
You've been pursuing your career.
And all I get are flimsy excuses.

287
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:09,133
- Please don't scream.
- Why don't you say it plainly?

288
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:14,478
That I don't have the aesthetics.
That I should stop dreaming about...

289
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:17,514
...becoming a professional singer.
That's not what's going to be, Rohit.

290
00:34:17,886 --> 00:34:22,789
I won't give up! And you for one,
cannot break my resolve! Get that?

291
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:32,933
I don't know why Rohit is doing
this. He mustn't do this to you.

292
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,065
- It's wrong on his part. - We've
finished our homework, Mother.

293
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:39,602
- May we go to play? - Make sure
you return soon. - All right.

294
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:48,647
You have the right to a career.
Why don't you discuss it with Rohit?

295
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,647
What are you doing here? I've been
looking for you so long.

296
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,517
- I had to discuss some
things with Farida. - What?

297
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:02,156
Besides Sonu is getting on my nerves.
Who is to take care of him?

298
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:05,259
I have to go to a rehearsal. Where
are my clothes? How about some food?

299
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:10,229
- I'm coming over. - And, where's
the file of my songs?

300
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:13,234
l've been looking for it all day.
I just can't find it.

301
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,339
l'd brought it down with me for my
practice session.

302
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:24,545
Why don't you just sit over here for
the rest of the day practicing!

303
00:35:24,887 --> 00:35:27,014
- I said I'm coming. - Don't bother.
You can practice singing...

304
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:29,980
...for the rest of the day.
I'll feed myself at a restaurant.

305
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:32,591
- I'll look after the household too.
- Have I ever refused to do all that?

306
00:35:43,172 --> 00:35:46,505
- What've you done? - Sorry, Mother.
- You've got my washing all dirty.

307
00:35:47,409 --> 00:35:51,846
l've been at the laundry for 2 hours.
And I've asked you not to play here.

308
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:56,080
How many times have l
asked you not to play?!

309
00:35:57,486 --> 00:36:00,455
What's up, Kiran? Why did you beat
him? What has he done?

310
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:04,984
He won't listen to me. And now,
he's got the laundry all dirty.

311
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:11,162
I'm sick and tired of chorus all day.
l've gone out of my mind.

312
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:29,013
We tread upon the same path, Kiran.
What could be better for both of us?

313
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:24,297
Open up, quickly.
Come on, hurry up.

314
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:30,969
Make sure to remember the day today.
We'll celebrate this day every year.

315
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,577
This is the day I've awaited forever.
The day on which my career commences!

316
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:39,884
Today was the day! Amar-Kaushik were
left speechless after I auditioned.

317
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:43,453
I'm singing the first song
for Pawan Chopra's new film.

318
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:45,625
I'm leaving, Rohit.

319
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:50,254
And they said that if this song
passes the muster while recording...

320
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:53,829
...I'll get to sing all the songs
for the film. I'm recording tomorrow.

321
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:56,099
- Want to come along?
- I said I'm leaving.

322
00:37:57,206 --> 00:37:59,231
- Where are you going?
- Here are the keys to the house.

323
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:02,902
These are the rationing cards...and
here are the bills for the month.

324
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:04,575
l've paid all the bills.

325
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:07,612
You'll find the balance of the
money in the cupboard.

326
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:12,820
Here's the electricity bill. Make
sure you pay it up by the weekend.

327
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,917
I'm leaving you.

328
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:19,886
Wait a minute! What are you saying?
What's happened?

329
00:38:20,262 --> 00:38:23,254
- Have I done anything wrong?
- No, you haven't. - What's it then?

330
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:24,656
- Tell me.
- Don't touch me!

331
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:27,930
- Just let me go. - But why are
you leaving? Say something!

332
00:38:28,237 --> 00:38:34,005
Why don't you understand! It isn't
just an isolated something.

333
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,500
It might be my mistake too.

334
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:41,346
- Something is happening to me.
- What's this with you?

335
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:46,112
- I don't know! - It's nothing more
than a figment of your imagination.

336
00:38:50,259 --> 00:38:56,926
-I must make a life for myself. -But
this and here, is what your life is!

337
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:02,866
Else, I'll go out of my mind.

338
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:10,410
So you want to walk out of this
marriage. But what of Sonu?

339
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,941
How can you walk out on him?

340
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:19,584
But, he's better off without me.

341
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:23,756
Oh God! I don't believe this! Kiran!
Why are you doing this to me?!

342
00:39:24,593 --> 00:39:29,087
l've just got my golden chance. And
here you are...walking out on me!

343
00:39:29,765 --> 00:39:34,964
I need you, Kiran. If you stand by
me, I can even reach for the stars.

344
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:38,906
But you had told me that we'd reach
out for the stars together.

345
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:46,545
D'you feel that I'm trying to stop
you from becoming a singer?

346
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:49,846
You might dream of becoming a singer.

347
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:53,345
But don't expect me to go around
singing false praises for you.

348
00:39:56,858 --> 00:40:02,296
I lost my head. I agree that both
of us have made mistakes.

349
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:05,124
But that doesn't mean that you must
walk out of your home. lsn't that so?

350
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:09,097
We can always mend our ways.
Now, come in.

351
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:12,734
Now you're being stubborn. Just
like your parents.

352
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:17,407
-Don't drag my parents into this.
-Why not? You carry the same traits.

353
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,474
Now, are you going to stop
taunting my parents?!

354
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:22,045
Won't l! They haven't been able to
achieve anything in life.

355
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:23,646
And they're jealous of others.

356
00:40:26,855 --> 00:40:29,824
- And d'you think I'm jealous of
your success? - Yes!

357
00:40:32,394 --> 00:40:35,386
Thank you very much.
I won't ever forget that.

358
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:42,225
l'd rather suffer my traits than
your taunts for the rest of my life.

359
00:41:04,393 --> 00:41:06,987
Where has Kiran gone?

360
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:11,666
- What I should be asking you?
- Why me?

361
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,625
Because she used to spend more than
half her working hours in your company.

362
00:41:14,936 --> 00:41:18,804
And the two of you must've more than
discussed my weak points.

363
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:22,172
Forget all that. Kiran has left you.

364
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:25,137
- We must do something about it.
- Not ''we''. It's I who has to do.

365
00:41:25,214 --> 00:41:27,211
And I'll do whatever must be done.

366
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:32,009
You must try to understand it now
or never. Kiran is very unhappy.

367
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:34,946
- And the fact is that...
- Fact remains that of the past 6 years...

368
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,758
... I've been trying heart and soul
to get a break...

369
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:39,754
... so that my career can take off;
so that my life shapes up!

370
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:43,895
After 6 long years, I get a break.
I'm slated to sing for Amar-Kaushik!

371
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,030
I took a cab home as soon as I got
to know; so that I could...

372
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:49,428
... share the greatest moment of
my life with her.

373
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:52,036
And she tells me that she's
walking out of my life.

374
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:58,170
- What does it mean?! - She couldn't
share the greatest moment of your life.

375
00:41:58,346 --> 00:42:03,909
- It's your life, after all.
- You're fantastic!

376
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:09,014
That your husband deserted you
because you were unhappy...

377
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:12,487
... doesn't mean that every woman
is unhappy with her husband.

378
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:21,297
I haven't come here to discuss my
husband. I'm concerned about Kiran.

379
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:24,904
- You may keep your concern within
your confines. - I shall.

380
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,207
Before I leave, let me tell you that
you could never understand Kiran.

381
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:32,475
She is no petty woman to serve as
a part of your interior decor.

382
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:36,773
She had her own dreams. And it
takes courage for a woman to walk out.

383
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:44,587
Yes! And it takes more to walk out
on a helpless child. lsn't that so?

384
00:43:20,662 --> 00:43:29,502
- Why are you sleeping here?
- Oh.. what? - And where's Mummy?

385
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:36,538
- Tell me... Where's Mummy?
- What's the time now?

386
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:40,776
The small hand is on 7.
And the big hand is on 3.

387
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,914
I'm going to be late
for the recording.

388
00:43:45,353 --> 00:43:49,449
- Tell me, Daddy... where's Mummy?
- Wait a minute.

389
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:57,495
- You mother has gone to your aunt's.
- Which aunt?

390
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,937
-The one in Pune. -Aunt Ratna lives
there. - That's where she has gone.

391
00:44:04,806 --> 00:44:09,937
- When is she going to come back?
- Very soon.. in 3 or 4 days.

392
00:44:10,378 --> 00:44:13,643
Now make a move.
l've got to get ready.

393
00:44:15,317 --> 00:44:18,809
- Who's going to get me ready
for school? - I will, son.

394
00:44:20,388 --> 00:44:22,481
- And, who'll pack my school bag?
- I will.

395
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:28,225
- Who'll take me to school?
- I will.

396
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,467
- What about my breakfast? - l...
what do you eat for breakfast?

397
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:37,338
An omelette of 2 eggs, toast with
butter and Bournvita.

398
00:44:42,677 --> 00:44:46,807
A dash of coriander... and onions.
Ever had one of my omelets?

399
00:44:47,148 --> 00:44:51,710
- No.
- Try it today. You'll love it.

400
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:58,148
- You're cutting them in such
large chunks! - That's just fine.

401
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:01,592
lsn't this fun! Yes, it's fun.

402
00:45:02,631 --> 00:45:07,625
Now, take a look at this.. a circus
with one hand... two eggs in one hand!

403
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,267
Now take a look at how I break
both eggs using one hand.

404
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:16,702
The eggs had soft-shells.
But never mind.

405
00:45:20,382 --> 00:45:22,407
This place is perfectly clean.

406
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:27,515
What are you doing?
I'm not going to eat that!

407
00:45:27,956 --> 00:45:31,892
- It has shells in it. - A few
shells will make the omelette crisp.

408
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,028
- Here go the onions... and the
chilies. - Not that way! - How else?

409
00:45:35,497 --> 00:45:39,126
Mummy used to flip the
ingredients first.

410
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:43,161
What Mummy doesn't know is that an
omelette is an omelette, flip or flap!

411
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:47,630
Eat it and you'll know. Later on,
I'll drop you at the school.

412
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:50,878
And afterwards, I'm off to record
my first song ever!

413
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:54,440
Your Daddy is going to
become a famous singer.

414
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,341
- What's up?
- The toast is burning!

415
00:45:59,788 --> 00:46:02,188
Well, never mind that.

416
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:15,935
You don't know a thing!

417
00:46:18,173 --> 00:46:22,507
Go on in... hurry.
Go inside.

418
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:25,345
- Who'll come to pick me up?
- I'll come.

419
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,344
Where are you going to
wait for me?

420
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,511
I'll wait for you under this tree,
okay? Now go on inside.

421
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:35,256
- What if you don't turn up?
- I said I'll come. And, I will.

422
00:46:35,924 --> 00:46:39,758
- What if you're late? - I won't
be late. I'll be here on time.

423
00:46:40,261 --> 00:46:47,565
- What if you're still late? - If
I am, you can wait under the tree.

424
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,337
Go on, now. Hurry.

425
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,171
- When does the school get over?
- No idea.

426
00:46:59,681 --> 00:47:02,479
When does the junior school
get over?

427
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:06,478
- I'm that child's father.
- At 2 o'clock.

428
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,729
- I'm sorry to be late.
- ls this your idea of time?

429
00:47:23,571 --> 00:47:26,233
You've turned a star even before
you've recorded a single song.

430
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:30,840
-I got stuck in the traffic. - Never
mind. Sit inside and get the lines.

431
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:33,539
We'll record the orchestra in the
meantime. Let's have another take.

432
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:39,517
- Give him his lines, will you?
- Come on for the break in your life.

433
00:47:42,757 --> 00:47:44,748
- We can fit the 16 tracks on to 12.
- Very well. Let's try.

434
00:47:49,731 --> 00:47:50,959
Let's have the rhythm.

435
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:59,263
Still waiting here? I'm afraid
we won't be recording you today.

436
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:03,238
- Sir...?
- lncrease the bass slightly.

437
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:08,275
- When will I record?
- After a couple of days perhaps.

438
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,083
Do keep calling to find out.

439
00:48:40,648 --> 00:48:43,378
I'm late by only half-an-hour.
Must you be so upset?

440
00:48:43,685 --> 00:48:46,950
- You said you'd be here on time.
- I did. But I was so busy.

441
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:52,256
- What if someone kidnapped me?
- But no one did?

442
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:54,218
What if someone did?

443
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:58,896
l've told ten times that
I'm sorry.

444
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,259
You must forgive
someone who apologizes.

445
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,100
Do you know the meaning
of the word ''sorry''?

446
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:08,099
What are you doing?

447
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:11,602
What's up?

448
00:49:14,148 --> 00:49:19,279
This car run on batteries. It has a
horn. And, the headlights work too.

449
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:24,781
- So what?
- I'll forgive you if you buy me one.

450
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:29,254
What if I don't? Won't
you forgive me ever?

451
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:34,333
Had it been Mummy, she would've got
the car for me.

452
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,330
Ask your mother for one when she
comes back. Now, let's go. Come on.

453
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:48,288
Sunil, be quiet, please.

454
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:57,917
It's late. It's time to sleep.
Let's go to bed.

455
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:08,540
I already knew, already knew!
Look what you did!

456
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,844
Sit there!
Did not I tell you to be quiet?

457
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:13,554
I'm tired of telling you not
not to play on the table.

458
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:18,166
Well you can apologize.
After all, who gives you a bath?

459
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:18,468
You.

460
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,973
Who gives you food?

461
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:20,976
It's you.

462
00:50:21,077 --> 00:50:22,580
Who takes you to school and picks you up?

463
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:23,583
You.

464
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:24,589
And who is buying you ice cream?

465
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,590
It's you.

466
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:29,697
And this is how you thank me for everything
I do for you? You spoil me all my work!

467
00:50:31,504 --> 00:50:32,911
I already apologized.

468
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:38,523
It was the song I was composing.
And now it's spoiled!

469
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,635
I'll have to do it all over again.

470
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:43,167
I already apologized.
I know you're very angry.

471
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:47,370
But you do not have
to yell at me so much.

472
00:50:49,054 --> 00:50:53,361
Get up, brush your teeth, put on
your pyjamas and go to bed.

473
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,390
- 250 grams of lentil... anything
else? - A packet of tea.

474
00:51:09,397 --> 00:51:12,389
- The Red Label, or the Yellow?
- Yellow. - Not Yellow. The Red one.

475
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:16,899
- Why? - Because Mummy used to buy
the Red Label. - Give me red.

476
00:51:20,608 --> 00:51:22,508
A pack of soap and coconut oil.

477
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,246
- Can I have a chocolate?
- Take these upstairs.

478
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:37,450
Forgive me for asking this... but l
heard something. ls it true?

479
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:44,562
I heard that your wife left your...
no, I mean to say that she didn't...

480
00:51:44,866 --> 00:51:47,767
... care for you. She didn't care
for the child. Nor her status!

481
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:48,966
Let me have this package.

482
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:53,898
And I didn't like her either.
She used to have this temper.

483
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:56,676
Have I asked you what you liked
or disliked about my wife?

484
00:51:57,011 --> 00:51:58,740
- No, I mean...
- Have I asked for your opinion?

485
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,517
I come here to buy groceries. Not
to listen to your useless banter.

486
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:06,479
- Do you understand?
- Understood. Here's your stuff.

487
00:52:07,255 --> 00:52:11,248
That's worth 300. The balance last
month was 350, totaling 650 bucks.

488
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:14,728
- And I've stopped giving credit.
- I'm not asking for it.

489
00:52:15,229 --> 00:52:21,293
Here's your money. 550.. and I'm
sending 100 bucks for you right away.

490
00:52:24,472 --> 00:52:25,803
That's the credit.

491
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:45,759
- ls that all right, Mr. Manohar?
- Yes. Let's record it.

492
00:52:46,727 --> 00:52:50,163
Thank you, Mr. Sharma for letting
my friend sing in the chorus.

493
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:55,899
- She'll even sing a lead part if
you let her do it. - Of course.

494
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:59,873
Shall we proceed, Mr. Manohar?

495
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:04,203
Take a look at this!
A letter from Mummy.

496
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,078
A letter from Mummy! Here!

497
00:53:09,517 --> 00:53:12,350
- I see... it's addressed to you.
- Oh yes! It is.

498
00:53:12,787 --> 00:53:14,778
Read it, quickly. And tell me when
Mummy is coming home.

499
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,761
- Read it aloud.
- Oh, yes.

500
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:26,525
''My dear Sunil...''

501
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,703
''You must be wondering where your
Mummy has gone all of a sudden.''

502
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:36,567
''Let me explain this... sometimes
your Daddy had to leave home.''

503
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:38,573
''And then, it was Mummy
who looked after you.''

504
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,877
''Sometimes, when mothers leave,
fathers have to look after children.''

505
00:53:44,919 --> 00:53:48,184
''Your Mummy wants to make a
career for herself, Sunil.''

506
00:53:48,723 --> 00:53:51,123
''That's why I had to
leave your home.''

507
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:57,957
''I may not live with you anymore.
But, you'll remain in my heart.''

508
00:53:58,799 --> 00:54:02,326
''Don't ever think that
Mummy will forget you.''

509
00:54:02,937 --> 00:54:07,067
''I remain your Mummy always.
And I'll love you always.''

510
00:54:08,409 --> 00:54:12,675
''Take care of yourself. And, on
your way back from school everyday...''

511
00:54:44,278 --> 00:54:47,941
That was marvelous. Ms. Vandana.
And you must concentrate, Rohit.

512
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:50,544
I want the right perspective
in your voice.

513
00:54:50,985 --> 00:54:52,953
Don't sing in a stifled voice.
Open your voice up.

514
00:54:55,056 --> 00:55:01,393
That's my file, Sir. It contains
the songs I have written.

515
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:03,094
Don't be afraid.
We won't steal your tunes.

516
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:04,693
No! I didn't mean that.

517
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:07,325
Let's proceed with another take.

518
00:55:10,004 --> 00:55:11,999
Let's have a rehearsal without
the music accompaniment.

519
00:55:18,746 --> 00:55:21,943
That's a lot of crap! Let's have
some real voice. Haven't you eaten?

520
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:34,183
- Go on... sing it.
- Yes, Sir.

521
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:47,501
Forget about turning a music
director and concentrate on singing.

522
00:55:50,177 --> 00:55:52,543
- I'll ruin his happiness.
- Why! We have a composer!

523
00:55:58,886 --> 00:56:01,081
- Go on.
- Yes, Sir.

524
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:08,419
Nonsense! Forget it. Please sing
his lines for him, Ms. Vandana.

525
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:24,470
- Well done, Ms. Vandana. Excellent.
- Did you get an idea of the tune?

526
00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:29,739
- That's what I've been singing.
- Sing it properly! - Yes, Sir.

527
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:40,692
What are you doing! You're out
of tune! What are you up to?!

528
00:56:40,862 --> 00:56:42,524
- Please let me finish my lines.
- Shut up!

529
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:46,096
- If you interrupt, you can't
appreciate the singing. - Shut up!

530
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:50,668
0-Please listen to me. -Bloody fool!
Shut up! Who d'you think you are?

531
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:53,439
Stay within your limits!
Else I'll throw you out of here.

532
00:56:53,808 --> 00:56:55,366
And, I'll banish you forever
from filmdom.

533
00:56:55,976 --> 00:57:00,538
Will a singer in a night club to
teach me how to compose music?!

534
00:57:01,148 --> 00:57:04,311
- Yes. I can.
- What! What was it you said?!

535
00:57:05,419 --> 00:57:07,348
Oh yes! I'll teach you how to score
music right away.

536
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:09,020
That is, if you may dare
to listen to me.

537
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:10,856
lsn't this how you've composed it?

538
00:57:15,763 --> 00:57:17,424
lsn't that your song?
Now listen to this.

539
00:57:18,566 --> 00:57:19,533
Please play along with me.

540
00:58:03,778 --> 00:58:06,372
What are you up to, Sunil?
Be quiet and eat your food.

541
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,277
Pick up your spoon.

542
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:14,713
Go on. Eat.

543
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:17,489
It's yucky. It's bell plant and
it's very good for you. Go on, eat it.

544
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:23,420
-I don't like bell plants. -You do.
Aunt Farida has cooked it for you.

545
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:24,625
And you've eaten it earlier.

546
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:27,961
- What's all this black stuff
in this? - Onions. Now eat it.

547
00:58:28,502 --> 00:58:33,804
-Onions give me stomachaches. -Not
at all. And now start with the bread.

548
00:58:41,816 --> 00:58:44,346
- It's Yucky.
- You mustn't call food ''yucky''.

549
00:58:45,386 --> 00:58:49,322
Don't spit on your plate.
Where are your manners?

550
00:58:50,524 --> 00:58:52,458
Go on. Eat it now.
There... I've removed the onions.

551
00:59:02,803 --> 00:59:06,364
There's this chocolate ice-cream
you've brought. It's in the fridge.

552
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,406
Yes I know about the ice cream.
But, you won't get any of it.

553
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:13,473
You must finish your food first.
Only afterwards you may eat it.

554
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:15,008
Sunil!... Where are you going?

555
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:16,883
Don't you open the fridge!

556
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:20,616
Now don't take the ice-cream out
of the fridge.

557
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:26,016
Can't you hear me? I'm getting
very angry with this now.

558
00:59:29,763 --> 00:59:32,755
Don't take the ice cream.
I'm warning you, Sunil.

559
00:59:34,635 --> 00:59:37,661
I'm warning you.
Don't you dare eat that ice cream.

560
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:45,973
Eat the ice-cream and you'll face
dire consequences. D'you understand?

561
00:59:49,283 --> 00:59:52,912
Get up. Now!
And let go of the chair.

562
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:55,987
You unmannered boy!
And stop screaming.

563
00:59:58,325 --> 01:00:00,122
- I want to got to Mummy!
- Enough of it.

564
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:02,687
No food for you. Nor any ice cream.
You can go to sleep hungry.

565
01:00:03,397 --> 01:00:04,523
I won't talk to you ever again.

566
01:00:53,514 --> 01:00:54,473
He's asleep.

567
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:21,203
Will you leave me and go away too?

568
01:01:21,942 --> 01:01:26,709
- Never.
- But Mummy left me and went away.

569
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:31,048
- That's because I'm a bad boy.
- ls that what you think?

570
01:01:35,184 --> 01:01:42,224
That isn't true. Mummy loves you.
She didn't leave because of you.

571
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:47,198
She left because
I couldn't understand her.

572
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,702
I wanted her to do what all other
mothers do all their lives...

573
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:57,270
... tending the family and doing
household chores.

574
01:01:59,146 --> 01:02:06,917
But she wanted to do something else.
And she tried to reason with me.

575
01:02:07,688 --> 01:02:15,185
But I was too involved
with my life and myself.

576
01:02:16,163 --> 01:02:20,827
And do you know why she
stayed back so long with us?

577
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:24,360
That's because she loved you, son.

578
01:02:26,674 --> 01:02:32,044
She didn't leave us because of you.
She left because of me.

579
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:40,487
Now, go to sleep.

580
01:02:43,023 --> 01:02:49,861
Let's start a new life from
tomorrow... you and me.

581
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,920
<i>I'm alone, you're alone.</i>

582
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:40,920
<i>When we're together,
then there is no sorrow.</i>

583
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:45,920
<i>You're my heart, you're my life.</i>

584
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:49,920
<i>Oh I love you daddy!</i>

585
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:55,920
<i>You are innocent,
you are mischievous...</i>

586
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:59,920
<i>But you love me daddy!</i>

587
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:55,920
<i>A little boy you are for sure...</i>

588
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:59,920
<i>but you're the leader of all.</i>

589
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:05,920
<i>And due to these mischiefs...</i>

590
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:09,920
<i>I'm loved by everyone!</i>

591
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,920
<i>This is said by
thousands of people...</i>

592
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:21,920
<i>But there is no one like you.</i>

593
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:27,920
<i>I'm alone, you're alone.</i>

594
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:31,920
<i>When we're together,
then there is no sorrow.</i>

595
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:37,920
<i>You're my heart, you're my life.</i>

596
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,920
<i>Oh I love you daddy!</i>

597
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:47,920
<i>You are innocent,
you are mischievous...</i>

598
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:51,920
<i>But you love me daddy!</i>

599
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:22,920
<i>Just imagine,
if tomorrow this entire world...</i>

600
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:26,920
<i>doesn't stand by my side.</i>

601
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:34,920
<i>Then who'll be the companion
of my journey?</i>

602
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:37,920
<i>It'll be me, daddy!</i>

603
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:42,920
<i>Everything seems
so beautiful today...</i>

604
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:48,920
<i>our world, our moments.</i>

605
01:06:49,462 --> 01:06:54,173
<i>I'm alone, you're alone.</i>

606
01:06:54,462 --> 01:06:59,174
<i>When we're together,
then there is no sorrow.</i>

607
01:06:59,463 --> 01:07:04,175
<i>You're my heart, you're my life.</i>

608
01:07:04,464 --> 01:07:08,173
<i>Oh I love you daddy!</i>

609
01:07:09,462 --> 01:07:14,173
<i>You are innocent,
you are mischievous...</i>

610
01:07:14,466 --> 01:07:19,176
<i>But you love me daddy!</i>

611
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:58,336
- Let's have another ride. - No.
I'm tired. Go on. Play by yourself.

612
01:08:03,343 --> 01:08:04,901
You've changed so completely, Rohit.

613
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:10,106
I only wish Kiran should've
seen you in these spirits.

614
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:12,481
- Don't talk about Kiran.
- Very well.

615
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:18,086
- Tell me the truth... don't you
ever think about her? - Not at all.

616
01:08:22,763 --> 01:08:25,357
Look at me, Daddy!

617
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:29,458
- Don't do that, Sunil.
- No! It's my turn now!

618
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:37,833
- Don't you think about your husband?
- His case was quite different.

619
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:44,547
- He had started having an affair.
- Really? I had no idea. Who was it?

620
01:08:45,318 --> 01:08:50,449
He had this girl in his office. And
my Romeo wanted to bring her home.

621
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:51,846
What nonsense!

622
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:55,851
Look at me now, Daddy!
I'm coming down standing up!

623
01:08:56,196 --> 01:08:59,256
- No, Sonu. What are you up to?
Get down. - I'll get him down.

624
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:05,762
- What happened afterwards? - I told
him he was free to do what he liked.

625
01:09:05,797 --> 01:09:08,070
But I wouldn't let go of the house.
It's for my children and me.

626
01:09:08,508 --> 01:09:14,344
- No! Sonu!
- Watch your step, Sonu!

627
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:15,980
What's happened, Sonu?!

628
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:17,808
Take him to a hospital. Hurry!

629
01:09:34,434 --> 01:09:37,926
Nothing's going to happen to you,
Sonu. You're going to be all right.

630
01:09:54,821 --> 01:09:57,585
I'll treat you
to ice creams afterwards.

631
01:10:27,187 --> 01:10:31,351
I'm Ravinder Kapoor. I'm the chief
assistant director in RP Films.

632
01:10:31,925 --> 01:10:34,416
- I see. - I have come
here for a sound transfer.

633
01:10:34,861 --> 01:10:37,853
I saw your friend all of a sudden.
She's very good.

634
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:40,959
My director wants a smart girl as he
is about to shoot an important scene.

635
01:10:41,334 --> 01:10:44,030
The role is that of a friend
to the leading lady.

636
01:10:44,404 --> 01:10:47,737
No. Not stand-by.

637
01:10:48,508 --> 01:10:51,602
You don't know Mr. Kapoor.

638
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,472
That's right. Mr. Paresh Kapoor.

639
01:10:55,749 --> 01:11:00,709
- You must've seen his film last
year. - Yes. - It was a super hit.

640
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:02,213
It's still raking in royalties.

641
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:06,887
- How many days is she to work
at it? - It's only a day's shoot.

642
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,055
- But...
- How much money will she make?

643
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:12,454
2000. And I'll make sure she
gets 100 bucks as conveyance.

644
01:11:14,868 --> 01:11:18,099
- I'll speak to her about it.
- Please do try. I'll wait for you.

645
01:11:33,553 --> 01:11:36,784
l've dumped Sunju.
He says that I'm selfish.

646
01:11:37,524 --> 01:11:40,459
He asked me why I went to see
a film when he was sick.

647
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:45,092
I couldn't bore myself sitting
by him all evening; now could l?

648
01:11:45,565 --> 01:11:47,089
Have I done anything wrong?

649
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:51,562
Tell me, Anjali... have
I done anything wrong?

650
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,865
You were supposed to
deliver your lines.

651
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:58,872
Don't you remember your lines?

652
01:12:03,183 --> 01:12:04,707
Will she be able to
deliver the lines?

653
01:12:05,318 --> 01:12:10,722
You wanted someone simple and
innocent. She'll deliver all right.

654
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:13,693
Didn't I tell you that I don't
know anything about acting?

655
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:19,392
All you have to do
is to my your lines.

656
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:26,038
Tell me, Anjali...
What have I done wrong?

657
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:31,902
You haven't done
the right thing, Deepa.

658
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:38,379
D'you remember how anxious he
was when you had fallen sick?

659
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:43,052
He kept by you and cared
for you like a man possessed.

660
01:12:43,957 --> 01:12:48,690
And you can't even spare
an evening for him!

661
01:12:49,262 --> 01:12:50,991
You call that boredom.

662
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:56,963
The truth is that you've
never even understood Sunju.

663
01:12:58,004 --> 01:12:59,767
He loves you very much.

664
01:13:03,376 --> 01:13:06,243
She's going on saying
whatever she wants to.

665
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:13,545
l'd told you earlier that l
know nothing about acting.

666
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:21,252
I tried it at my friend's instance.
I really want to become a singer.

667
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:27,858
- Very well... you may sing some.
- Sir...?!

668
01:14:23,323 --> 01:14:25,985
- Please listen to the songs I've
scored. - I've helped you already.

669
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:29,623
I introduced you to Amar Kaushik.
And you've disgraced me.

670
01:14:30,196 --> 01:14:33,962
- They started misbehaving with me.
- Will they really misbehave?

671
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:38,462
- You see, Mr.Gulbadan. - You see,
Mr. Rohit, I merely run...

672
01:14:38,705 --> 01:14:41,538
.. a small-time music company. We
only publish records and cassettes.

673
01:14:41,975 --> 01:14:47,971
I'm not a film producer.
Now, please excuse me.

674
01:14:51,785 --> 01:14:54,583
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Please take your time.

675
01:14:55,355 --> 01:14:57,721
One minute, Mr. Rohit.

676
01:14:58,525 --> 01:15:00,049
I can help you sell your songs.

677
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:05,620
Amar Kaushik needs new tunes.
I'll get you 2000 for each tune.

678
01:15:05,999 --> 01:15:08,934
- Here's my card. - So they get
the credit for my compositions.

679
01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:10,495
Why bother about the credit?

680
01:15:22,549 --> 01:15:26,212
You want me to give you a job so
you can walk out on me again.

681
01:15:27,053 --> 01:15:32,548
That won't happen ever again. I beg
your pardon. Please give me a chance.

682
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:14,223
- lsn't that, Mrs. Kiran?
- Yes. She's Rohit Kumar's wife.

683
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:16,796
- She's made a heroine in films.
- She used to sing.

684
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,329
And now, she's up to
dancing in public.

685
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:23,934
Come quickly, Dad.
Take a look... over there.

686
01:16:24,244 --> 01:16:25,836
It's Mummy's picture.

687
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,838
They put up the posters today.

688
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:35,449
I want to see Mummy's film. You'll
take me to see it, won't you?

689
01:16:35,955 --> 01:16:40,858
You'll take me, won't you, Daddy?...
Won't you, Daddy? Please tell me.

690
01:17:46,369 --> 01:17:47,961
How are we to see Mummy's film now?

691
01:17:50,373 --> 01:17:52,500
It's a ''house-full'' show.
Let's go home.

692
01:17:53,143 --> 01:17:58,945
I want to see Mummy's film! You'd
promised to show me Mummy's film.

693
01:18:00,116 --> 01:18:02,744
I want to see Mummy's film at once!

694
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,658
Hurry up, Daddy.

695
01:18:33,883 --> 01:18:36,408
How come you're here?
No one is allowed up here.

696
01:18:36,853 --> 01:18:40,619
He wants to see how his Mummy's film
is projected. I spoke to the manager.

697
01:18:41,357 --> 01:18:44,520
-ls he Ms. Kiran's son? -Yes. -Very
well. You can sit here and see it.

698
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:47,493
''Tell me... what can
you do for my sake''

699
01:18:48,164 --> 01:18:50,928
''I can do just about
anything for your sake.''

700
01:18:51,367 --> 01:18:53,858
''I'd get the sun, the moon
and the stars for you.''

701
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:58,172
''I'd bring the heavens and
earth together for your sake.''

702
01:19:00,477 --> 01:19:04,277
- What's the matter, honey? - I'd
rather love a straightforward fellow.

703
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:06,875
''You needn't bring the sun, moon,
nor the stars into this.''

704
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,995
''You can take your rotten son back
to America with you.''

705
01:19:26,336 --> 01:19:28,395
'' Before you leave, try some
delicious lndian cakes.''

706
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,290
Can you tell us how you are feeling
right now, Mrs. Kiran?

707
01:20:23,293 --> 01:20:25,485
I'm happy to see that the audiences
have liked my performance.

708
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:28,163
- Would you like to work again with
Paresh Kapoor? - Yes, of course.

709
01:20:28,598 --> 01:20:30,828
Any plans for the future?
What kind of films would you like?

710
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:36,264
- I haven't thought about it. - We
hear that you are Mrs. Kiran Kumar.

711
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:39,470
- It's said that you're married, and
that you have a son. Who said that?

712
01:20:40,143 --> 01:20:44,011
Don't ask vulgar questions. And now
you've had enough. Please step aside.

713
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:47,042
Come along, Kiran. Let's go.

714
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:36,062
- Has Mummy forgotten me, Daddy?
- No.- Then why didn't she stop?

715
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:37,863
Why didn't she talk to me?

716
01:21:40,737 --> 01:21:44,935
- Can I go to see her sometime?
- No. - Why not?

717
01:21:53,716 --> 01:21:55,445
Did you see those stars?

718
01:21:57,086 --> 01:22:00,146
They shine, merrily, but they are
far away from us.

719
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:07,689
Your Mummy is now like a star. You
can see her and long for her.

720
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:10,559
But you can't go anywhere near her.

721
01:22:19,025 --> 01:22:21,289
Come on...Let's go home.

722
01:22:38,744 --> 01:22:40,735
Then, my Mummy goes to a forest.

723
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:43,273
She comes across a
huge fellow in the forest.

724
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:47,579
My Mummy bashes him up.

725
01:22:48,621 --> 01:22:51,112
- Go upstairs, Sunil.
- After a minute, please, Daddy.

726
01:22:51,657 --> 01:22:55,991
Then the hero comes, and sings a
song with my Mummy.

727
01:22:56,596 --> 01:23:01,260
-My mummy's very beautiful.-Really?
-She's more beautiful than yours.

728
01:23:03,402 --> 01:23:08,169
Beautiful she is. But, she's more
stubborn than she's beautiful.

729
01:23:08,641 --> 01:23:12,304
Why don't you go over to her, patch
up and bring her back?

730
01:23:13,746 --> 01:23:22,484
If I go to her now, she'll think
that I've come because she's a star.

731
01:23:22,855 --> 01:23:29,727
Forget her. ln any case, it was she
who left me. I didn't desert her.

732
01:23:30,897 --> 01:23:35,357
- She can return if she wants to.
- And you're very stubborn too.

733
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,100
We've finished the cola.
Hey Moolchand!

734
01:23:44,577 --> 01:23:48,111
- What's up? - 2 Colas please.
- I've closed for the day.

735
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,105
Down the shutter.

736
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:54,077
-Open up if you've closed down. - Am
I to stay open all night for you?

737
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:57,489
If you're so interested, you could
walk a block to fetch it.

738
01:23:58,391 --> 01:24:01,554
- Why don't you fetch some for us?
- Am I your servant?

739
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:07,765
- Forget him. He's an illiterate.
- What?! An illiterate, am l?!

740
01:24:08,101 --> 01:24:09,490
Did you call me an illiterate?

741
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:13,605
Oh yes. I am an illiterate. And l
know exactly what I am. Unlike you.

742
01:24:14,073 --> 01:24:16,974
You sing in a rotten nightclubs and
think you're no less than Elvis.

743
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:21,305
He calls me an illiterate! And he
sits drinking in front of his son.

744
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:25,979
You couldn't even take care of your
wife. And he is lording it over me!

745
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,516
You bloody! What
did you say about my wife?!

746
01:24:28,988 --> 01:24:31,456
- No! Don't!
- What did you say about my wife?!

747
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:33,181
I'll break your face! I will!

748
01:24:34,226 --> 01:24:39,459
- Let go! And you! Get lost!
- Don't you dare touch me!- Get lost?

749
01:24:40,499 --> 01:24:45,436
- Let's go! Just come back here...
and I'll show you! - Don't fight!

750
01:24:46,472 --> 01:24:48,633
Go home, Moolchand!

751
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:52,438
And you're a strange fellow. Must
you pick up a fight with such a scum?

752
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:57,211
- Bad fellow! Come on, let's have
a drink. - No, he spoilt my mood.

753
01:24:57,817 --> 01:24:58,749
Come home, Sunil.

754
01:25:04,523 --> 01:25:05,785
What's it with you, now?

755
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:16,356
Hey! I just fell down.
Let's squat here for sometime.

756
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:25,133
- Why do you drink rum, Daddy?
- What did you know about rum?

757
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:27,870
I know everything.
Rum is an alcoholic drink.

758
01:25:30,683 --> 01:25:34,210
One day, a drunk came
to the gates of our school.

759
01:25:34,687 --> 01:25:38,521
The kids at school were
teasing him and poking fun at him.

760
01:25:38,591 --> 01:25:40,049
And everyone threw stones at him.

761
01:25:40,092 --> 01:25:43,625
I don't want anyone
to make fun of you.

762
01:25:48,534 --> 01:25:49,831
Do you love me so much?

763
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:59,867
I love you very much too. I love
you more than anyone else on earth.

764
01:26:00,179 --> 01:26:02,909
If you love me so much,
you must stop drinking.

765
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:09,386
From now on, I won't drink.

766
01:26:22,601 --> 01:26:26,503
There's this fatso in our class.
Deven. He bullies everyone around.

767
01:26:26,872 --> 01:26:31,741
He snatched Prakash's lunch box
away. I complained to the teacher.

768
01:26:32,144 --> 01:26:35,170
Why complain? Box him in the
stomach. That'll do him right.

769
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:38,242
- Well, what will you do to him?
- I'll box him in the stomach.

770
01:26:50,062 --> 01:26:51,927
Go on now.
I'll be back to take you home.

771
01:27:10,883 --> 01:27:14,478
I was passing by when
I saw the two of you.

772
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:19,521
Sonu was looking quite cheerful.

773
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:31,330
I'd thought I'd
call you up sometime.

774
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:36,102
But I decided that it'd be better
if I met you personally.

775
01:27:42,214 --> 01:27:43,078
How are you?

776
01:27:45,351 --> 01:27:50,618
I'm fine, and I don't have much
to worry about. How have you been?

777
01:28:43,809 --> 01:28:48,644
- Are you very forlorn, Daddy?
- No, I'm not. Why do you ask?

778
01:28:49,415 --> 01:28:52,748
Nothing particularly. Are you
thinking about Mummy?

779
01:28:55,921 --> 01:28:57,320
Go to sleep now.

780
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:12,960
<i>My heart says, go, meet her!</i>

781
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:18,960
<i>But my feet stop as
they start to move forward.</i>

782
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:25,650
<i>Sometimes my heart
gets the better of me...</i>

783
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,970
<i>Sometimes I try to control it.</i>

784
01:29:44,770 --> 01:29:49,669
<i>My heart says, go, meet him!</i>

785
01:29:50,771 --> 01:29:55,668
<i>But my feet stop as
they start to move forward.</i>

786
01:29:56,769 --> 01:30:01,667
<i>Sometimes my heart
gets the better of me...</i>

787
01:30:02,768 --> 01:30:08,669
<i>Sometimes I try to control it.</i>

788
01:30:45,769 --> 01:30:55,668
<i>My beloved, since
we have separated,</i>

789
01:30:57,769 --> 01:31:08,670
<i>I have everything with
me in my life.</i>

790
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:15,170
<i>A lot of wealth...</i>

791
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:20,170
<i>A lot of fame.</i>

792
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:26,170
<i>But after losing you I feel that...</i>

793
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:33,160
<i>I don't have anything
if you're not here.</i>

794
01:31:34,767 --> 01:31:39,665
<i>You don't know how many...</i>

795
01:31:39,766 --> 01:31:45,666
<i>regrets I have in my heart.</i>

796
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:51,160
<i>Sometimes my heart
gets the better of me...</i>

797
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:58,160
<i>Sometimes I try to control it.</i>

798
01:32:50,769 --> 01:32:55,668
<i>How beautiful were those days...</i>

799
01:32:56,769 --> 01:33:01,667
<i>when we were together.</i>

800
01:33:02,768 --> 01:33:13,664
<i>And I could embrace you.</i>

801
01:33:14,765 --> 01:33:25,660
<i>It was just you in
my days and nights...</i>

802
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:31,160
<i>But you are so far
above me, my beloved...</i>

803
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:37,160
<i>That I can't even touch you.</i>

804
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:44,320
<i>It's impossible to reach you.</i>

805
01:33:44,768 --> 01:33:50,666
<i>Just thinking about it
makes me so miserable.</i>

806
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:56,160
<i>Sometimes my heart
gets the better of me...</i>

807
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:02,160
<i>Sometimes I try to control it.</i>

808
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:08,160
<i>My heart says, go, meet him!</i>

809
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:14,160
<i>But my feet stop as
they start to move forward.</i>

810
01:34:40,799 --> 01:34:43,768
- Take a look at this!
- What's up? - Read it!

811
01:34:44,169 --> 01:34:47,002
- Read..? -Read it..see who
wrote it! - One Pawan Malhotra.

812
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:50,571
- The film director! - Didn't he
direct CHAHAT?-That's him all right!

813
01:34:50,976 --> 01:34:53,103
He has signed me up to score the
music for his forthcoming film.

814
01:34:53,478 --> 01:34:56,140
- What are saying?! - Really?!
- Yes! And I can't believe it!

815
01:34:56,515 --> 01:34:59,109
Pawan Malhotra patted
my shoulder and said...

816
01:34:59,585 --> 01:35:01,985
''You're a very talented fellow!
How come I didn't meet you before?''

817
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:03,515
He liked my songs very much!

818
01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:06,990
Thank God for that.
And congratulations!

819
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:08,390
Hey Moolchand!

820
01:35:09,695 --> 01:35:11,720
Take a look at this!
Get that?!

821
01:35:12,097 --> 01:35:13,155
All right. Understood.

822
01:35:15,167 --> 01:35:17,965
So you've got money!
When are you going to pay me up?

823
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:20,861
I haven't yet received money.
I've just signed the contract.

824
01:35:21,273 --> 01:35:24,265
I'll get the money soon. Let's
celebrate with tea for everyone.

825
01:35:24,543 --> 01:35:26,841
- Very well..er..What do you mean?
- It's on me, of course.

826
01:35:27,313 --> 01:35:29,505
-You should've said so. Come on in.
-I'll have a cup of tea too!

827
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:37,083
Are you going to become the
greatest music director now?

828
01:35:37,489 --> 01:35:40,215
That I'll become. But, do you know
what I'm going to do before that?

829
01:35:40,292 --> 01:35:42,189
- What? - Your birthday is coming up,
isn't it. - Oh yes.

830
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:45,155
- I'll get you a surprise gift
for your birthday. - Really?

831
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:49,059
- Yes. - What's it going to be?
- How can I tell you about it now?

832
01:35:49,301 --> 01:35:51,496
I know what! lsn't it something
I showed you the other day?

833
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:54,600
ls it yellow in color?

834
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,566
The battery operated car!

835
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:07,211
- Where does Mr. Rohit Kumar live?
- I'm Rohit Kumar.

836
01:36:13,191 --> 01:36:15,125
Ms. Kiran has sent this for you.

837
01:36:15,527 --> 01:36:16,516
It's Mummy's car!

838
01:36:17,029 --> 01:36:20,829
Hey folks! Come on quick! Take a
look at this. It's my Mummy's car!

839
01:36:35,213 --> 01:36:36,077
What's it?

840
01:36:37,816 --> 01:36:38,882
It's a letter from Kiran.

841
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:44,812
She wants to celebrate Sonu's
birthday. She has invited us over.

842
01:36:47,159 --> 01:36:49,627
You'll go over, won't you?

843
01:36:54,166 --> 01:36:55,531
You should go over.

844
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:04,640
Tell her that we will come.
But, there's no need to sent the car.

845
01:37:27,766 --> 01:37:28,858
You mustn't be naughty, Sonu.

846
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:32,027
And you must speak to everyone
politely, understand?

847
01:37:32,838 --> 01:37:34,430
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. Okay.

848
01:37:35,607 --> 01:37:37,575
If anyone offers you anything
to eat, don't be greedy.

849
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:41,641
Refuse it politely. But if you
must have it, say thanks afterwards.

850
01:37:42,013 --> 01:37:42,604
Sonu has arrived.

851
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:11,631
- I hope we aren't late.
- No problem.

852
01:38:12,544 --> 01:38:16,241
- I was worried that you wouldn't
come. - But, I have come.

853
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:15,330
Let me introduce you... my wife,
Lajwanti...and,...Mrs. Tolaram.

854
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:33,754
- Sorry for leaving you alone for a
while. - Only a while, wasn't it?

855
01:39:37,062 --> 01:39:40,998
- I get childish when I'm with kids.
- You've always been childish.

856
01:39:45,370 --> 01:39:48,396
Sonu is still cheating at
the game. He's just like you!

857
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:53,172
You're looking lovely.

858
01:39:57,182 --> 01:39:58,706
Come over here for a moment, Kiran.

859
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:01,519
I'll be back in a moment.

860
01:40:04,589 --> 01:40:08,184
Won't you meet others around?
We have other guests too.

861
01:40:08,994 --> 01:40:11,827
Have you invited everyone to watch
you prancing with that fellow?

862
01:40:12,597 --> 01:40:16,590
-I'll leave this party if you speak
so. - You must consider your status.

863
01:40:17,168 --> 01:40:23,073
- You're a star. And, journalists
are attending. - Who invited them?

864
01:40:23,808 --> 01:40:27,676
I wanted to celebrate a birthday.
You've made a circus out of it.

865
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:31,078
Don't teach me what to do
and what not to.

866
01:40:31,516 --> 01:40:37,455
As of now, just stay away from him.
We have other guests here too.

867
01:40:38,623 --> 01:40:41,217
- Happy tidings, Mr. Ramdayal.
- Thank you.

868
01:40:42,327 --> 01:40:43,760
Happy tidings to you too.

869
01:40:50,669 --> 01:40:55,936
- What's up? Any problem?
- Nothing at all.

870
01:40:57,742 --> 01:40:59,573
They might not have taken
a liking to my presence.

871
01:41:03,982 --> 01:41:09,045
- I should've sent Sonu here alone.
- But why? I wanted you to come too.

872
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:11,989
I wanted all of us to celebrate
Sonu's birthday together.

873
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:16,291
I've taken a lot of pains to organize
this party. And now, these people...

874
01:41:16,728 --> 01:41:20,095
... they've spoilt my mood.

875
01:41:29,207 --> 01:41:33,701
- I've asked you not to run around!
- Hey fatso! You won't catch me!

876
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:37,774
- Let me go! He'll catch me! Let him.
- I got caught because of you!

877
01:41:37,783 --> 01:41:40,146
That's just as well. Now you can
sit with Mummy for a while.

878
01:41:41,886 --> 01:41:42,443
My child!

879
01:41:44,356 --> 01:41:48,292
- What's that mark? - I was playing
on the side. And I fell down.

880
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:54,020
-Oh no! -And it bled a lot. -Did
it take stitches? - Yes 8 stitches.

881
01:41:54,866 --> 01:42:01,328
- How did it happen? - My mistake. l
wasn't careful. And he didn't listen.

882
01:42:02,507 --> 01:42:05,237
It didn't hurt his eyes, thank God!
I could never have forgiven myself.

883
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:08,003
- And I didn't even cry.
- Really?

884
01:42:10,882 --> 01:42:13,009
- Come on, Mummy. I want to see
your house. - Let's go.

885
01:42:13,451 --> 01:42:16,147
- Come along too, will you?
- No. Just go on. - All right.

886
01:42:23,294 --> 01:42:25,023
- See you later.
- Excuse us.

887
01:42:28,166 --> 01:42:29,428
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

888
01:42:30,802 --> 01:42:34,636
- Have you had the cakes and other
goodies? - Yes I have, thank you.

889
01:42:35,874 --> 01:42:38,308
- Had enough?
- Not yet. I'll have some more.

890
01:42:43,615 --> 01:42:48,211
- Seen the villa?
- Yes. It's a huge one.

891
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:52,818
-It stretches right up to the beach.
-There's a swimming pool back there.

892
01:42:53,224 --> 01:42:56,660
- I see! - It cost a million bucks.
- Fantastic.

893
01:42:59,097 --> 01:43:04,592
- Are you still at song-and-dance
at the hotel? - Well, you see...

894
01:43:05,036 --> 01:43:08,070
- Glory be to The Divine mother.
- Greetings, Mr.Gulbadan Kumar.

895
01:43:08,074 --> 01:43:10,832
Greetings. Happy tidings
on your son's birthday.

896
01:43:11,109 --> 01:43:15,944
I'm very upset with him, I am!
Tell me, is this any way to behave?!

897
01:43:16,347 --> 01:43:22,115
You're the sole object of discussion
in the film business nowadays.

898
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:28,081
He has scored such lovely songs; and
he has put Amar Kaushik to shame!

899
01:43:29,327 --> 01:43:31,227
Well, you've become
a very important person nowadays.

900
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:34,826
But you mustn't forget simple folks
like me. Do call up once in a while.

901
01:43:35,166 --> 01:43:37,896
- Never mind that. But you must
get me the music rights. - Sure.

902
01:43:39,037 --> 01:43:41,631
- Together, we'll make a stupendous
success out of it. - Surely.

903
01:43:42,774 --> 01:43:49,145
Divine Mother be praised! A heroine
and a music director in the family!

904
01:43:49,547 --> 01:43:54,075
No dearth of money! I suggest you
become a film producer. Say what?!

905
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:58,521
- Excuse me. - Oh yes.
- Be back soon.

906
01:43:59,891 --> 01:44:03,156
- How many films have you signed?
- Just one till now.

907
01:44:04,696 --> 01:44:08,427
You'll get many more, I'm sure.
But take care about signing films.

908
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:14,032
- What'd you like to have? Whisky
or rum? - I've stopped drinking.

909
01:44:14,839 --> 01:44:19,799
May The Divine Mother bless you!
A Coca-cola for the gentleman, please.

910
01:44:20,512 --> 01:44:23,811
Hello there! Nowadays, you don't
seem to care for us.

911
01:44:24,215 --> 01:44:27,844
That isn't the case at all.
ln fact, we were discussing you.

912
01:44:28,586 --> 01:44:32,022
After all, he has rising star with
him. Mr. Rohit Kumar!

913
01:44:32,891 --> 01:44:35,121
The singer and composer.
A two-in-one!

914
01:44:37,395 --> 01:44:44,699
Congratulations!
So even you've got a film!

915
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:49,938
What I don't understand is how he
bagged the film.

916
01:44:50,375 --> 01:44:57,747
Because there still are people
who value caliber. Not names.

917
01:44:58,249 --> 01:45:03,084
I see! But I think that behind
every successful man lies a woman.

918
01:45:03,421 --> 01:45:08,552
But slightly different in this case;
..a successful woman behind the man!

919
01:45:11,095 --> 01:45:15,122
- What do you mean? - Can a woman
who is beautiful and successful...

920
01:45:15,466 --> 01:45:20,529
- ...not do as much for her husband?
- Surely she can do!

921
01:45:22,006 --> 01:45:26,272
- What nonsense are you speaking?
- Do you think Pawan Malhotra has...

922
01:45:26,644 --> 01:45:28,339
... signed you because he
likes your rotten songs?

923
01:45:28,713 --> 01:45:35,346
- We were supposed to sign this film.
- You've got it because of your wife.

924
01:45:36,187 --> 01:45:42,353
Don't believe it, d'you? Why! It's
commonplace. Come here, Mr. Tolaram.

925
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:45,288
- Come here, Mr. Tolaram. - Yes.
Come here. - What's up, gentlemen?

926
01:45:45,530 --> 01:45:47,964
- Tell him... go on! Tell him how he
has landed this film. - Oh forget it!

927
01:45:48,366 --> 01:45:53,463
- Go on, speak up. Tell him! - He
has scored some very good songs.

928
01:45:53,805 --> 01:45:57,036
- To hell with the songs! You had
signed us. - Well yes, I did...

929
01:45:57,609 --> 01:46:02,979
- On his wife's say-so, you threw us
out! Correct? - Nothing of the sort!

930
01:46:03,381 --> 01:46:07,147
- She had merely...
- D'you hear that, Mister two-in-one?

931
01:46:07,418 --> 01:46:11,752
It happens dear. Everything goes
in this business.

932
01:46:12,357 --> 01:46:16,157
- People do use their good-looking
wives too. - Oh yes. They do.

933
01:46:23,701 --> 01:46:28,434
Look...look at what's going on
over there. Go on... over there.

934
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:35,270
Someone bashes me up... and you're
trying to patch up! What's going on?

935
01:46:36,047 --> 01:46:40,780
That's true! He couldn't cook
anything. Not even eggs!

936
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:44,084
Really?! How is it now? Nowadays
he has picked up a few things.

937
01:46:44,123 --> 01:46:46,815
He makes a dish out of potatoes
now and then. Of potatoes?! Yes.

938
01:46:47,458 --> 01:46:51,451
Sometimes, there are excess of
turmeric in it. But, I make do.

939
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:53,997
Oh hello, Rohit. Come in.

940
01:46:54,632 --> 01:46:57,533
- Go downstairs, Sunil. - One minute
please, daddy, I want to tell mummy...

941
01:46:57,802 --> 01:47:01,738
- I asked you to go downstairs!
- What's up, Rohit?

942
01:47:04,943 --> 01:47:06,274
Wait for me downstairs.

943
01:47:10,581 --> 01:47:12,515
Did you speak to Pawan Malhotra
about me?

944
01:47:14,252 --> 01:47:16,686
Did you ask him to replace me with
Amar Kaushik as a music director?

945
01:47:18,056 --> 01:47:20,581
- Why are you asking me this?
- Did you tell him, or, didn't you?

946
01:47:22,694 --> 01:47:24,389
Give me an answer, Kiran.

947
01:47:26,597 --> 01:47:27,393
Yes.

948
01:47:28,466 --> 01:47:34,029
- Why?
- Because I wanted to help you.

949
01:47:34,572 --> 01:47:37,234
I don't want your help!
I don't want anyone's help!

950
01:47:37,809 --> 01:47:41,711
- Won't I succeed without your help?
- That's not the case, Rohit.

951
01:47:42,046 --> 01:47:45,345
D'you want to prove that you're so
big that you can make anyone?

952
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:49,049
I've never thought of it that way,
Rohit. I did it because...

953
01:47:49,387 --> 01:47:52,151
... I know that you can score
better music than those fellows.

954
01:47:52,523 --> 01:47:54,753
That's what I wanted to prove
on my own.

955
01:47:55,426 --> 01:47:57,326
And now, you've spoiled everything.

956
01:47:58,329 --> 01:48:02,163
People will say that I've succeeded
because my wife helped me.

957
01:48:02,533 --> 01:48:04,091
My success will never be mine!

958
01:48:06,537 --> 01:48:10,803
- I can't do it! - Tell Pawan
Malhotra that I won't do this film!

959
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:13,942
Don't lose your head, Rohit.
Pawan Malhotra liked your music.

960
01:48:14,412 --> 01:48:17,575
That's why he has signed you.
I haven't forced him to.

961
01:48:18,416 --> 01:48:21,408
What does it matter if a few
people tell you a lot of nonsense?

962
01:48:22,487 --> 01:48:26,355
I'm your wife.
If I don't help you, who else will?

963
01:48:27,658 --> 01:48:32,061
I see! So can you walk out on me,
or come to my aid at your sweet will?

964
01:48:32,397 --> 01:48:36,595
You don't want to help me. You just
want to show off your magnanimity.

965
01:48:36,968 --> 01:48:39,368
You want to show me how
small I am, compared to you.

966
01:48:39,437 --> 01:48:41,537
And you want to show your concern
for me though you live apart.

967
01:48:48,012 --> 01:48:53,109
You've always thought ill of me.
You've always got me wrong.

968
01:48:53,151 --> 01:48:55,284
Why must I try to understand
you in the first place?

969
01:48:56,088 --> 01:48:58,722
I don't want to understand you.
Nor do I want to see you ever!

970
01:48:58,723 --> 01:49:00,688
Don't ever try to meet me again!

971
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:06,294
Stop! Rohit!

972
01:49:07,598 --> 01:49:10,089
- Don't step inside this house ever
again! - Listen to me! Please!

973
01:49:10,501 --> 01:49:13,937
Come to your senses!

974
01:49:15,753 --> 01:49:20,155
I already know why you
argued with me at the party.

975
01:49:20,356 --> 01:49:23,358
She intends to start over
with that man again.

976
01:49:23,759 --> 01:49:27,160
It took only a few minutes with him
to want to ruin everything again.

977
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,662
Don't ever think about it.
Do not think I'll allow it. I won't.

978
01:49:30,762 --> 01:49:34,160
What's going on in this girl's head?

979
01:49:34,458 --> 01:49:38,459
Leave her alone. She must
be tired. Let's go. - No!

980
01:49:39,459 --> 01:49:43,159
I want to hear from her mouth that
she'll never see him again.

981
01:49:59,917 --> 01:50:00,849
How did all this come here?

982
01:50:01,719 --> 01:50:04,688
Look, Daddy! My birthday
presents! Mummy sent these over.

983
01:50:07,592 --> 01:50:11,619
This is a military jeep. It turns
around whenever it collides.

984
01:50:13,498 --> 01:50:15,864
Look! Here's a remote control car.

985
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:23,197
Why can't we live in
Mummy's house?

986
01:50:26,611 --> 01:50:31,446
- Don't you like this house? - This
home is fine, but... - What of it?

987
01:50:32,049 --> 01:50:34,449
But her house is so big...
and it's so nice.

988
01:50:34,919 --> 01:50:38,912
She has 3 TV sets. We don't
have a single one.

989
01:50:46,397 --> 01:50:47,989
What did Mummy tell you at
this party yesterday?

990
01:50:48,833 --> 01:50:54,032
- She said that she loves me very
much. - What did you tell her?

991
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:58,272
That she's the best
Mummy on earth.

992
01:51:01,145 --> 01:51:03,841
So now you want to live with
Mummy, do you?

993
01:51:09,787 --> 01:51:12,221
- I'm asking you something.
- Do you know something?

994
01:51:12,657 --> 01:51:15,785
Mummy is going to buy
the battery-operated car for me.

995
01:51:16,494 --> 01:51:20,191
-Did you ask her for it?
-No, I just told her that I like it.

996
01:51:20,765 --> 01:51:23,199
She said that she'd buy it for me.

997
01:51:23,634 --> 01:51:26,227
Why did you have to ask her for it?
I was supposed to buy it for you.

998
01:51:27,138 --> 01:51:32,269
- You haven't got it yet.
- But l was to get it for your birthday.

999
01:51:33,211 --> 01:51:35,679
- And now, my birthday is gone.
- All right. I know that.

1000
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:42,150
I'll get you that car today.

1001
01:51:43,387 --> 01:51:46,823
Understood? I'll get
it today! For you.

1002
01:51:48,025 --> 01:51:51,051
My car is coming today!

1003
01:52:02,406 --> 01:52:08,675
- How much does that car cost?
- 5000 Rupees. - 5000?! - Yes.

1004
01:52:09,046 --> 01:52:12,573
- It's a bit too much for that car.
- Fixed price. Take it or leave it.

1005
01:52:12,984 --> 01:52:15,714
- An advance of 5000 Rupees?!
- I need the money, Sir.

1006
01:52:16,454 --> 01:52:21,289
So you need all of 5000 Rupees!
D'you hear that, Mr. Godwill?

1007
01:52:22,627 --> 01:52:24,857
You may deduct a thousand rupees
every month out of my salary.

1008
01:52:25,229 --> 01:52:28,426
- lt'd be adjusted within 5 months.
- Will you be here for 5 months?

1009
01:52:29,267 --> 01:52:32,498
Seems like you've got a chance
to sing in some third rate film.

1010
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:35,361
- And now, you're looking for chance
to give me the slip. - No, Sir.

1011
01:52:35,873 --> 01:52:38,808
That isn't the case at all!
I've forgotten these dreams.

1012
01:52:39,844 --> 01:52:43,712
The only person I have to
myself is my 6 year old son.

1013
01:52:45,283 --> 01:52:49,515
Yesterday was his birthday.
And I had promised him a gift.

1014
01:52:50,354 --> 01:52:54,051
A gift... worth 5000 bucks!

1015
01:52:56,093 --> 01:53:00,257
D'you hear that. Mr. Godwill?! I've
never given a single gift to my son.

1016
01:53:00,598 --> 01:53:03,465
And my good man wants to give a
gift worth 5000 bucks to his son!

1017
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:12,932
You've spun a good spiel. But, I'm
not one to be taken in my your story.

1018
01:53:13,311 --> 01:53:15,973
- Please try to understand...- Don't
waste my time. And back to work!

1019
01:53:18,983 --> 01:53:23,079
Let's get working. We don't have
a circus happening here, do we?

1020
01:53:25,256 --> 01:53:27,519
- So you won't let me have the
money will you? - Not at all.

1021
01:53:30,094 --> 01:53:34,121
What are you doing?! I'll call
the police! Stop him, Godwill!

1022
01:53:34,765 --> 01:53:36,164
What hooliganism is this?

1023
01:53:36,834 --> 01:53:40,270
Put it down on my account.

1024
01:53:42,073 --> 01:53:43,233
Stop him!

1025
01:53:46,077 --> 01:53:47,101
Catch him!

1026
01:53:59,724 --> 01:54:02,454
Snatch the money from him!

1027
01:54:24,482 --> 01:54:28,009
Know something, aunt Farida? Daddy
is getting me a battery-powered car.

1028
01:54:28,686 --> 01:54:32,315
ls that so?
That's good news, I say.

1029
01:54:32,723 --> 01:54:36,318
- It's getting late. Time to have
dinner. - I won't eat now.

1030
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:39,390
- I'll eat when Daddy comes home.
- No knowing when he'll return.

1031
01:54:39,564 --> 01:54:41,397
I must go home and get my
kids to do their homework.

1032
01:54:41,566 --> 01:54:44,360
- Go on... eat your dinner quickly.
- No. I won't eat now.

1033
01:54:46,103 --> 01:54:49,334
Very well. I'm leaving the food
here. Eat it when you feel hungry.

1034
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:48,660
When did you return?
I didn't even get to know!

1035
01:55:54,004 --> 01:55:56,234
Where's the car, Daddy?

1036
01:55:58,576 --> 01:56:02,842
- Why haven't you eaten yet?
- I was waiting for you.

1037
01:56:04,348 --> 01:56:08,114
You mustn't stay awake so late.
I don't like this at all.

1038
01:56:08,919 --> 01:56:12,912
I was waiting so we
could eat together.

1039
01:56:37,348 --> 01:56:46,086
- What's happened, Daddy? - I lost
my son. I have lost. - Don't cry.

1040
01:56:47,157 --> 01:56:52,390
- Please don't cry, Daddy.
- My son asked me for only one thing.

1041
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:59,794
And I couldn't get it for him.
This is the worst defeat in my life.

1042
01:57:00,871 --> 01:57:04,932
I don't want that car, Daddy.
Really... I don't want it.

1043
01:57:24,194 --> 01:57:29,188
Here... I have some money.
And I'm going to get more.

1044
01:57:29,733 --> 01:57:33,829
And I'm going to get
that car for you.

1045
01:57:39,977 --> 01:57:43,378
But, please stop
drinking, Daddy. Please.

1046
01:57:46,984 --> 01:57:53,548
I'll get that car for you, Sonu.
I will.

1047
01:58:24,888 --> 01:58:27,584
- Mr. Pawan Malhotra has summoned
me here. - Please follow me.

1048
01:58:35,699 --> 01:58:38,259
Please forgive me, Rohit. I've had
you summoned here using the alias.

1049
01:58:40,771 --> 01:58:41,897
Else, you wouldn't have come.

1050
01:58:43,173 --> 01:58:47,200
- I want to discuss something.
- ls anything worth discussing?

1051
01:58:48,212 --> 01:58:50,646
Please sit down, Rohit.

1052
01:58:56,987 --> 01:59:00,445
You had told me something the other
day. All I want to know is whether...

1053
01:59:01,925 --> 01:59:06,624
... it is your final decision.
- Why?

1054
01:59:07,665 --> 01:59:13,331
- Are you still firm about not
meeting me ever again? - Absolutely.

1055
01:59:16,306 --> 01:59:21,369
- ln that ease, I want my son.
- What was it you said?!

1056
01:59:22,379 --> 01:59:26,839
- I want Sonu to live with me.
- You want Sonu! lncredible!

1057
01:59:27,317 --> 01:59:31,185
How could you even think of it?
You left him when he needed you.

1058
01:59:31,689 --> 01:59:34,055
- D'you want me to... - You haven't
seen him in a year and a half.

1059
01:59:34,525 --> 01:59:37,892
You haven't even asked if he's dead
or alive. And now you want him!

1060
01:59:38,328 --> 01:59:42,492
-Sonu needs me. He'll be happy with
me. - And, isn't he happy with me?

1061
01:59:43,467 --> 01:59:47,494
Now wait a minute! D'you mean to
say that I can't keep him happy?

1062
01:59:47,905 --> 01:59:53,741
- I didn't say so. - D'you think you
can give him more happiness...

1063
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:58,241
... because you're wealthy? - Please
don't shout, Rohit.- Why mustn't l!

1064
01:59:58,549 --> 02:00:03,509
- I'm his mother. And you can't deny
my right. - Neither can you mine!

1065
02:00:03,987 --> 02:00:07,150
I'm his father.
And he stays with me.

1066
02:00:10,294 --> 02:00:12,854
I'd even go to court to get Sonu.

1067
02:00:25,309 --> 02:00:27,607
Well, how do I play that?
Just like Daddy, don't l?

1068
02:00:36,987 --> 02:00:39,512
I'm sorry for having
touched the piano, Daddy.

1069
02:00:51,034 --> 02:00:54,128
ln terms of this notice,
Ms. Kiran seeks a divorce from you.

1070
02:00:54,938 --> 02:00:57,498
And, she wants that the child
be placed in her custody.

1071
02:01:00,444 --> 02:01:07,907
- All I want is my son. - I'll tell
you something before I take the case.

1072
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:11,947
ln such cases, the decision
generally favors the mother.

1073
02:01:12,389 --> 02:01:14,550
I have been parenting him
for nearly two years now.

1074
02:01:14,825 --> 02:01:17,885
- She had abandoned the child.
- Yet, Ms. Kiran remains the mother.

1075
02:01:18,395 --> 02:01:22,161
Besides, she's a successful woman.
You don't have a job. That's worse.

1076
02:01:28,333 --> 02:01:34,843
You'd have to pay for court fees and
mine to the extent of 50 or 60,000.

1077
02:01:35,512 --> 02:01:38,777
That's irrespective of whether you
win or lose. D'you have the money?

1078
02:01:39,583 --> 02:01:47,046
- Yes. Please prepare the brief.
- Very well.

1079
02:01:47,624 --> 02:01:50,593
You may come here on Wednesday at
10 am. We'll discuss the case.

1080
02:01:51,295 --> 02:01:55,527
- Please bring 20,000 towards
expenses in advance - All right.

1081
02:02:06,777 --> 02:02:11,146
-I can pay 15,000 for all these
instruments.- 15000 only! How come?!

1082
02:02:11,515 --> 02:02:14,973
The piano is worth at least 20,000.
I'd bought it for 30,000.

1083
02:02:15,886 --> 02:02:18,411
I should get at least 40,000
for all the instruments.

1084
02:02:18,789 --> 02:02:21,690
This is business for me. I should
be able to earn a bit out of this.

1085
02:02:23,594 --> 02:02:29,897
- Well, give me at least 25,000.
- I can't pay more than 15,000.

1086
02:02:30,234 --> 02:02:33,067
- Very well, you may leave.
- You seem to be cross with me, Sir.

1087
02:02:33,437 --> 02:02:36,964
- We don't want to sell. Now, please
leave.- It's yours, do as you please.

1088
02:02:37,407 --> 02:02:39,170
- Please leave.
- Excuse me, gentleman.

1089
02:02:39,643 --> 02:02:41,474
What a waste of time!
Why did they call me at all?

1090
02:02:43,881 --> 02:02:47,180
Have you gone out of your mind?
Can a junk dealer appreciate these?

1091
02:02:48,352 --> 02:02:52,516
You're worrying for nothing. Sell
my furniture to raise the money.

1092
02:02:53,423 --> 02:02:59,658
No. You've already
done so much for me.

1093
02:03:02,099 --> 02:03:04,693
- I'll sell my songs.
- Sell your songs?!

1094
02:03:04,968 --> 02:03:06,993
- To whom?
- To Amar Kaushik.

1095
02:03:07,704 --> 02:03:09,262
You've really gone
out of your mind.

1096
02:03:11,275 --> 02:03:14,574
- He's willing to pay me 1000 for
every song. - Who gets the credit?

1097
02:03:15,379 --> 02:03:19,281
- They get the credits.
- You mustn't do such a thing.

1098
02:03:20,817 --> 02:03:25,720
These are fruits of your labor.
They're your hopes, your dreams.

1099
02:03:26,056 --> 02:03:28,286
How can you give that
away to someone?

1100
02:03:30,127 --> 02:03:34,928
Your songs are beautiful, Rohit.
You must get credit for these songs.

1101
02:03:37,167 --> 02:03:40,762
That's what I thought too.
I thought my songs were beautiful.

1102
02:03:41,171 --> 02:03:45,301
But, I've tried for so many years.
And, no one seems to like them.

1103
02:03:45,742 --> 02:03:48,040
And, at long last, I think
I have been entirely wrong.

1104
02:03:48,112 --> 02:03:50,437
- My songs might really be worthless.
- I don't agree to that.

1105
02:03:51,048 --> 02:03:57,715
-You're making a big mistake, Rohit.
- I may be. But, if in exchange...

1106
02:03:57,988 --> 02:04:03,187
... for these, I can have Sonu,
then these songs are priceless.

1107
02:04:05,329 --> 02:04:08,628
Else, these are no more than
scribbling on paper.

1108
02:04:33,150 --> 02:04:36,450
<i>Why did you break my heart?</i>

1109
02:04:37,150 --> 02:04:41,450
<i>Why did we fall in love?</i>

1110
02:04:42,150 --> 02:04:47,450
<i>Why did you go away?
Away... away...</i>

1111
02:04:48,150 --> 02:04:51,450
<i>Why did you steal my heart?</i>

1112
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:56,450
<i>If you wanted to break it.</i>

1113
02:04:57,150 --> 02:05:00,450
<i>Why did you fall in love with me?</i>

1114
02:05:01,150 --> 02:05:05,450
<i>If you wanted
to turn away from me.</i>

1115
02:05:23,150 --> 02:05:26,450
<i>Why did you break my heart?</i>

1116
02:05:28,150 --> 02:05:30,450
<i>Why did we fall in love?</i>

1117
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:37,450
<i>Why did you go away?
Away... away...</i>

1118
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:59,450
<i>You taught my heart how to beat.</i>

1119
02:06:00,150 --> 02:06:04,450
<i>You taught my heart
how to writhe in pain.</i>

1120
02:06:05,150 --> 02:06:08,450
<i>There were hidden
tears in my eyes.</i>

1121
02:06:09,150 --> 02:06:13,450
<i>But you taught them
how to brim over.</i>

1122
02:06:20,150 --> 02:06:23,450
<i>Why did you settle
into my heart?</i>

1123
02:06:24,150 --> 02:06:27,450
<i>If you just wanted
to toy with my affections.</i>

1124
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:32,450
<i>Why did you fall in love with me?</i>

1125
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:36,450
<i>If you wanted
to turn away from me.</i>

1126
02:06:37,150 --> 02:06:41,450
<i>Why did you steal my heart?</i>

1127
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:22,550
<i>Whenever our gazes met...</i>

1128
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:27,390
<i>I felt as if my heart
was on fire.</i>

1129
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:31,600
<i>As if smoke was coming
out from my breaths.</i>

1130
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:37,550
<i>I was not able to
live and neither die.</i>

1131
02:07:43,250 --> 02:07:46,550
<i>Why did you start a fire?</i>

1132
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:50,550
<i>If you wanted to leave
without putting it out.</i>

1133
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:55,550
<i>Why did you fall in love with me?</i>

1134
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:59,550
<i>If you wanted
to turn away from me.</i>

1135
02:08:01,031 --> 02:08:04,057
The filmfare award for the Best
music director, this year for...

1136
02:08:04,434 --> 02:08:10,771
... the song DlL MERA CHURAYA
KYON goes to Amar Kaushik.

1137
02:09:04,761 --> 02:09:08,253
Mr. Rohit Kumar's attorney
has sent me this letter today.

1138
02:09:09,165 --> 02:09:13,829
He has agreed
to divorce Ms. Kiran.

1139
02:09:14,337 --> 02:09:18,205
But he has refused the prayer to
place Ms. Kiran's son Sunil Kumar...

1140
02:09:18,441 --> 02:09:22,241
... under her custody. The case
therefore rests upon the contention...

1141
02:09:22,612 --> 02:09:29,211
... as to who may have custody of
the child. Before arguing the case...

1142
02:09:29,552 --> 02:09:32,783
-... I'll present some witnesses.
- This lawyer is a tough one.

1143
02:09:34,190 --> 02:09:37,284
I shall speak the truth, and
nothing but the truth.

1144
02:09:37,861 --> 02:09:42,696
Can you tell the court something
about your daughter, Mrs. Ramdayal?

1145
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:48,995
My daughter is a simple girl, and
has all the qualities of a girl...

1146
02:09:49,406 --> 02:09:53,240
... who has had a respectable
upbringing. She's an obedient girl.

1147
02:09:53,710 --> 02:09:57,146
Why then, did she marry Rohit
Kumar against your wishes?

1148
02:09:58,415 --> 02:10:04,376
That's the only mistake she has
committed in all her life.

1149
02:10:04,754 --> 02:10:07,154
And, she's still suffering for
her mistake.

1150
02:10:09,225 --> 02:10:13,958
This man had treated her so cruelly
that she was forced to leave his...

1151
02:10:14,264 --> 02:10:21,033
... house at midnight. - Thank you
Mrs. Ramdayal. You may step down.

1152
02:10:21,971 --> 02:10:25,338
Can you tell the court about Rohit
Kumar's character, Mr. Ramdayal?

1153
02:10:26,209 --> 02:10:29,178
What can I say about a man who
has no character?

1154
02:10:29,512 --> 02:10:35,348
He's a scoundrel; and he's wayward.
You mustn't consider his appearance.

1155
02:10:35,885 --> 02:10:38,581
He inveigled my daughter using
those looks, and with his words.

1156
02:10:38,788 --> 02:10:41,447
- Really?! - He claimed to be
a singer of great caliber.

1157
02:10:41,493 --> 02:10:43,823
And he said that he was going to
become a famous music director.

1158
02:10:43,961 --> 02:10:47,658
He's still where he was.
And look at my daughter!

1159
02:10:48,231 --> 02:10:50,665
She came out, and now, she's so
successful. And we don't want...

1160
02:10:50,667 --> 02:10:52,762
... Sonu to live with him, because
the boy will turn wayward.

1161
02:10:58,408 --> 02:11:02,105
Has Rohit Kumar ever shied away
from fulfilling his responsibilities?

1162
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:05,414
- No. - Has he ever tried
to shirk responsibility? - No.

1163
02:11:05,782 --> 02:11:10,810
- Has he been negligent towards his
son? - Never. ln fact, he spends...

1164
02:11:11,154 --> 02:11:14,954
... most of his time with his son.
He plays with the boy; amuses him;...

1165
02:11:15,291 --> 02:11:20,888
... reads stories to him and takes
him outdoors. Sunil is his very life.

1166
02:11:24,367 --> 02:11:28,770
I've seen very few fathers who would
do as much for their children.

1167
02:11:30,607 --> 02:11:32,541
Thank you very much, Mrs. Farida.

1168
02:11:38,581 --> 02:11:44,349
- For how many years have you known
Mrs. Kiran? - Some 7 years now.

1169
02:11:44,921 --> 02:11:50,791
Has Ms. Kiran ever told you
about her personal life?

1170
02:11:51,528 --> 02:11:55,794
Questions about Ms. Kiran's personal
life may be addressed to her only.

1171
02:11:57,834 --> 02:12:02,828
- Did she tell you anything about
her personal life. - Yes. - What?

1172
02:12:06,443 --> 02:12:11,574
- She was unhappy.
- With whom was she unhappy?

1173
02:12:12,382 --> 02:12:16,751
- She was unhappy about Rohit.
- Did Ms. Kiran ever tell you...

1174
02:12:17,153 --> 02:12:20,884
... that Rohit Kumar doesn't
care about his son at all?

1175
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:29,864
Please reply, Ms. Farida.
I haven't yet heard you.

1176
02:12:31,835 --> 02:12:34,736
-Yes. But, that had happened before
Kiran left. - Maybe. But he...

1177
02:12:35,071 --> 02:12:39,405
...didn't care about his son at all.
Now, Ms. Farida, can you tell me...

1178
02:12:39,909 --> 02:12:46,678
...if you ever advised Ms. Kiran
to break away? - No. I did not.

1179
02:12:49,619 --> 02:12:53,146
3 days before she walked out,
did you not tell her that:...

1180
02:12:53,723 --> 02:12:59,154
''If you are so unhappy, it'd
be better for you to leave''?

1181
02:12:59,696 --> 02:13:02,631
Yes. But I never thought that she'd
really do something like that.

1182
02:13:02,999 --> 02:13:08,762
''If you are so unhappy, it'd be
better for you to leave Rohit''

1183
02:13:09,405 --> 02:13:13,466
Kiran was a good friend. And, I was
concerned about her. I still am.

1184
02:13:14,177 --> 02:13:17,374
- And whatever I told her...
- Was born out of your feeling that...

1185
02:13:17,847 --> 02:13:22,079
... had Kiran lived on with Rohit,
she would've gone mad or could've...

1186
02:13:22,452 --> 02:13:27,151
... had a nervous breakdown, or she
may have even been driven to suicide.

1187
02:13:27,423 --> 02:13:32,690
-But l... -D'you want an innocent
child to live with such a man!

1188
02:13:36,499 --> 02:13:40,060
You're making a big mistake, Kiran.
Rohit has changed completely.

1189
02:13:41,504 --> 02:13:44,200
He is no more what he used to be.
Listen to me, Kiran. Please!

1190
02:13:45,208 --> 02:13:51,078
Don't take Sonu away from Rohit.
He needs Sunil. Without him...

1191
02:13:52,181 --> 02:13:53,671
Please don't do this to him.

1192
02:13:54,717 --> 02:13:57,311
If you do not step down, it will be
regarded as a contempt of this court.

1193
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:06,187
I can't quite understand how you're
going about this case, Mr. Bhatija.

1194
02:14:06,263 --> 02:14:08,788
At this rate, we're going to lose.
... out of the way, please.

1195
02:14:09,332 --> 02:14:11,732
Our witnesses are saying the truth.
And her lawyer is twisting facts.

1196
02:14:12,035 --> 02:14:14,526
D'you want me to tell lies too?
Must I stoop to Bhojwani's level?

1197
02:14:14,871 --> 02:14:21,800
D'you want me to raise a stink
over Ms. Kiran's personal life?

1198
02:14:22,412 --> 02:14:26,041
Am I to prove that she's deranged?
Must I accuse her of adultery?

1199
02:14:26,316 --> 02:14:29,149
- But that isn't true!
- Are you concerned about the truth?

1200
02:14:29,419 --> 02:14:31,717
Or, do you want your son? Tell me.
I'll handle the case accordingly.

1201
02:14:32,055 --> 02:14:34,580
I can present false witnesses as he
does. Do you want me to do that?

1202
02:14:36,459 --> 02:14:39,917
No. Do it honestly.

1203
02:14:46,803 --> 02:14:53,140
Look at her now. She has done well
for herself. She's the ideal woman.

1204
02:15:01,718 --> 02:15:05,882
My next witness is
Mr. Moolchand Gangar.

1205
02:15:10,259 --> 02:15:12,693
- Where did he transpire from?
- I have no idea.

1206
02:15:13,463 --> 02:15:15,795
- Who is he?
- The grocer in my neighborhood.

1207
02:15:16,766 --> 02:15:19,291
- We don't get along too well.
- You haven't told me about him.

1208
02:15:21,604 --> 02:15:25,131
- ls your shop located under
Rohit Kumar's residence? - Exactly.

1209
02:15:25,675 --> 02:15:29,167
- ln that case, you might be knowing
Rohit well. - Very well indeed.

1210
02:15:29,746 --> 02:15:34,206
- I've heard that he buys groceries
from your shop on credit. - Always.

1211
02:15:34,651 --> 02:15:38,246
- He might also be settling your
dues. - No. - Doesn't he?!

1212
02:15:38,721 --> 02:15:41,087
Why then do you still let him
enjoy your credit?

1213
02:15:41,524 --> 02:15:44,789
I allow credits to everyone.
You buy from me and you get credit.

1214
02:15:46,029 --> 02:15:49,590
Did you threaten to lodge a
complaint with the police, when...

1215
02:15:49,899 --> 02:15:52,697
... he had gotten drunk and
beaten you up?

1216
02:15:57,674 --> 02:16:02,976
If I told tales about your wife,
you would've bashed are up too.

1217
02:16:03,379 --> 02:16:05,711
Does it mean that you aren't
a good man?

1218
02:16:06,115 --> 02:16:09,607
It's not a question of being good or
bad. It's more a matter of intent.

1219
02:16:10,186 --> 02:16:14,486
- Now, did he pay you up after
the incident? - No, he didn't.

1220
02:16:14,857 --> 02:16:17,451
Now how does a man run his
household under the circumstances?

1221
02:16:18,027 --> 02:16:20,825
- How can such a person look after
his son? - You mean his son, Sunil?

1222
02:16:21,164 --> 02:16:24,861
- Yes. - He'd give his life for
Sunil. He loves his son very much.

1223
02:16:25,401 --> 02:16:28,427
He loves his son more than
I can ever love my son.

1224
02:16:28,838 --> 02:16:34,606
Love can't satiate hunger. And what
can one who has wrecked his home...

1225
02:16:34,944 --> 02:16:38,744
... provide for his son? - Rohit
Kumar has not wrecked his own family.

1226
02:16:39,048 --> 02:16:43,144
It's she... that woman sitting over
there? She has wrecked the family!

1227
02:16:44,654 --> 02:16:47,384
Please answer questions put to you.
Do not try to give a verdict.

1228
02:16:47,757 --> 02:16:51,853
Forgive me if I have erred. This is
my first ever appearance in court.

1229
02:16:52,261 --> 02:16:55,560
-I came here because he summoned me.
-You may leave now.

1230
02:16:55,898 --> 02:16:59,231
What you say is true. I've hated
Rohit Kumar for not repaying me.

1231
02:16:59,569 --> 02:17:01,002
I've even quarreled with him
for my money.

1232
02:17:01,637 --> 02:17:05,004
But my money isn't the bone of
contention. This is about his son.

1233
02:17:05,374 --> 02:17:11,006
You asked me what he'd do for his
son. Well, he has sold himself!

1234
02:17:11,314 --> 02:17:15,183
It might be easy for Ms. Kiran to
foot the bill for this lawsuit.

1235
02:17:15,218 --> 02:17:17,115
She's a famous heroine.
And she has loads of money.

1236
02:17:17,153 --> 02:17:22,686
But, it wasn't easy for Rohit.
Do you know what he did for his son?

1237
02:17:23,126 --> 02:17:28,496
He sold his life's savings...
his music... to Amar Kaushik.

1238
02:17:29,265 --> 02:17:31,756
They are now taking credit
for his music.

1239
02:17:36,072 --> 02:17:40,441
-Rohit Kumar must've told you that.
-No he didn't. But I know better.

1240
02:17:40,710 --> 02:17:44,069
I've heard all his songs so often,
it's still coming out of my ears.

1241
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:49,247
The song ''RAJ A KO RANl SE
PYAR HO GAYA''... it's Rohit's.

1242
02:17:50,419 --> 02:17:53,877
I'm telling you the truth! The song
wasn't written by Amar Kaushik.

1243
02:18:00,296 --> 02:18:06,360
- Do you love your son?
- Yes. I love him dearly.

1244
02:18:06,803 --> 02:18:08,703
Why did you leave him?

1245
02:18:09,372 --> 02:18:16,011
He used to think that
I'll remain a failure.

1246
02:18:17,712 --> 02:18:19,473
It ruined my confidence.

1247
02:18:21,717 --> 02:18:27,121
I became fatalistic about
my failures.

1248
02:18:28,324 --> 02:18:33,057
I was confused, and I started
losing my confidence.

1249
02:18:34,597 --> 02:18:39,933
I felt stifled and confused.
I was scared. And I left my home.

1250
02:18:41,771 --> 02:18:48,431
Then, I'd thought it better
for Sunil's sake

1251
02:18:50,332 --> 02:18:52,543
not to take him along.

1252
02:18:52,615 --> 02:18:56,578
Why then do you seek custody of
your son now?

1253
02:18:57,720 --> 02:19:03,047
I know I had deserted him.

1254
02:19:05,048 --> 02:19:11,088
I can never forgive myself
for the mistake.

1255
02:19:12,668 --> 02:19:20,268
But, the situation has changed.
And, I am confident of myself.

1256
02:19:22,278 --> 02:19:30,151
I can look after Sonu very well.
After all I reared him for 5 years.

1257
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:34,913
Must my child be taken away from me
because I've been away for 2 years?

1258
02:19:36,392 --> 02:19:39,934
He needs me now.

1259
02:19:43,735 --> 02:19:48,293
But I don't say that
he doesn't need his father.

1260
02:19:48,838 --> 02:19:53,901
But, he's still a child. He needs a
mother more than he needs a father.

1261
02:19:55,177 --> 02:19:58,112
And, I'm his mother.

1262
02:20:02,518 --> 02:20:05,043
I'm his mother!

1263
02:20:17,767 --> 02:20:20,235
You've spent nearly 6 years
with your husband.

1264
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:24,801
- Has he ever manhandled you?
- No. He hasn't.

1265
02:20:25,308 --> 02:20:26,866
- Did he use abusive language?
- No.

1266
02:20:27,310 --> 02:20:30,609
- Has he ever ill-treated your son?
- No.

1267
02:20:31,347 --> 02:20:33,941
- Do you regard your husband
to be a drunkard? - No.

1268
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:38,042
Has he ever had relations with other
women...in the nature of infidelity?

1269
02:20:38,487 --> 02:20:45,916
- No. - Then, the reason for your
desertion becomes amply clear.

1270
02:20:46,996 --> 02:20:53,925
With whom did you have the longest
lasting relationship before marriage?

1271
02:20:55,438 --> 02:21:00,137
- With my parents. - And you spent
some 22 years with them. - Yes.

1272
02:21:00,576 --> 02:21:03,545
But, you married Rohit Kumar
against their wishes. Right?

1273
02:21:03,946 --> 02:21:05,811
Yes. That's because I loved Rohit.

1274
02:21:06,315 --> 02:21:11,651
With whom, apart your parents have
you shared the longest relationship?

1275
02:21:12,688 --> 02:21:18,058
- With my son Sunil, I think.
- You spent 5 years with him.

1276
02:21:18,161 --> 02:21:19,826
And you've met him only
once afterwards!

1277
02:21:20,129 --> 02:21:23,959
Now consider your husband.
Don't you think you've shared a...

1278
02:21:24,001 --> 02:21:25,268
... very long relationship with him?

1279
02:21:27,303 --> 02:21:28,902
I didn't hear you, Ms. Kiran.

1280
02:21:29,705 --> 02:21:34,733
- Yes. - And how many years in
all, prior to your marriage...

1281
02:21:35,011 --> 02:21:37,172
... and afterwards have you shared
this relationship with him?

1282
02:21:38,714 --> 02:21:43,651
- Nearly 7 years. - 7 years!
Which means that you have failed...

1283
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:47,251
...to sustain a relationship by
marriage, a social institution...

1284
02:21:47,690 --> 02:21:52,957
... that is held holy and of
irrevocable bondage in our culture!

1285
02:21:55,831 --> 02:21:59,323
- Please state your reply, Ms.Kiran.
- Tell us, Ms.Kiran...

1286
02:21:59,635 --> 02:22:02,661
D'you agree that you've failed
to sustain the relationship.

1287
02:22:03,873 --> 02:22:08,003
- No, I didn't fail. - Didn't you?!
Would you rate this as a success?

1288
02:22:08,644 --> 02:22:11,738
- Your marriage is on the rocks.
- We have failed each other.

1289
02:22:12,481 --> 02:22:15,211
Not ''both of us'', Ms.Kiran.
It's you. You have failed!

1290
02:22:15,418 --> 02:22:21,414
You walked out on your husband.
He didn't. You failed the relationship.

1291
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:28,724
- It's the marriage which failed.
- Not the marriage. You failed!

1292
02:22:29,098 --> 02:22:32,124
You've failed to sustain the most
precious relationship of your life.

1293
02:22:33,469 --> 02:22:36,199
ls that true? Or, isn't it?

1294
02:22:45,915 --> 02:22:50,113
- Say it aloud. I didn't hear you.
ls it true? Or, isn't it? - Yes.

1295
02:22:51,787 --> 02:22:54,017
She walked out on her
parents after 22 years.

1296
02:22:54,623 --> 02:22:57,717
She walked out on
her husband for 7 years.

1297
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:03,764
What guarantee that she won't desert
her child after another 2 or 3 years?

1298
02:23:32,595 --> 02:23:34,324
D'you think that your
case stands weakened now?

1299
02:23:34,730 --> 02:23:36,859
You haven't lost a single suit
till date, Mr. Bhojwani.

1300
02:23:36,966 --> 02:23:40,299
- But it seems that you're going to
lose this one.- No comments please.

1301
02:23:43,372 --> 02:23:51,837
Generally, It's the woman who is
favored in disputes like this.

1302
02:23:53,315 --> 02:23:56,307
That's because she's
a woman and a mother.

1303
02:23:57,586 --> 02:24:02,353
But presently, the questions
revolve around the child.

1304
02:24:03,859 --> 02:24:08,922
As I understand, this Court will
decide in the child's interest...

1305
02:24:09,265 --> 02:24:11,358
... about what's good for Sunil.

1306
02:24:13,736 --> 02:24:17,172
I've been looking after
him for nearly 2 years now.

1307
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:22,506
I've learnt something.
And, I have understood much.

1308
02:24:23,812 --> 02:24:29,751
And slowly, I've understood
what it takes to be a good father.

1309
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:35,750
It takes patience. One needs to
spend a lot of time with the child.

1310
02:24:37,293 --> 02:24:39,625
For hours, I've heard
him talk of strange fantasies.

1311
02:24:40,462 --> 02:24:42,828
I'd get tired of listening to him.
But, I'd go on listening despite.

1312
02:24:43,432 --> 02:24:46,026
One must reply to a thousand
questions he has to ask.

1313
02:24:46,368 --> 02:24:49,098
One must be there with him whenever
need be, so he might not feel lonely.

1314
02:24:51,440 --> 02:24:57,572
To do all that, one must love.

1315
02:25:00,149 --> 02:25:09,683
And I don't know where it's written
that a woman can love more than a man.

1316
02:25:12,595 --> 02:25:17,328
Must a mother always love
the child more than the father?

1317
02:25:27,009 --> 02:25:31,810
I do not say that the child
cannot have a better upbringing.

1318
02:25:32,748 --> 02:25:35,182
I've always tried my best.

1319
02:25:37,353 --> 02:25:43,485
Sometimes I'd scold him and he'd
go to bed with a heavy heart.

1320
02:25:45,628 --> 02:25:51,396
Up next morning, we'd have breakfast
together and we'd laugh and talk.

1321
02:25:52,501 --> 02:25:53,798
It was all as if
nothing had happened.

1322
02:25:55,404 --> 02:25:59,500
Later, I'd drop him to school.
And while returning from school...

1323
02:26:00,042 --> 02:26:03,341
...he would tell me about what
had happened all day in school.

1324
02:26:03,646 --> 02:26:08,015
We used to dine together. And
afterwards I'd tell him stories.

1325
02:26:16,492 --> 02:26:23,898
We've created a world for ourselves.
And it took a lot of love to do that.

1326
02:26:25,668 --> 02:26:30,696
If this is destroyed,
we can never build it again.

1327
02:26:38,047 --> 02:26:41,847
Don't do this, Kiran.

1328
02:26:43,552 --> 02:26:48,615
Please don't do this to me again.

1329
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:08,967
You've told the court that it must
decide in the interest of your son.

1330
02:27:09,845 --> 02:27:10,277
Yes.

1331
02:27:11,447 --> 02:27:15,941
Did you work at the Copper Chimney
restaurant when you met Ms.Kiran?

1332
02:27:16,285 --> 02:27:18,378
- Yes,
- How much salary did you draw then?

1333
02:27:18,787 --> 02:27:20,220
3000 Rupees a month.

1334
02:27:23,659 --> 02:27:26,184
But, you were dismissed from the
job, weren't you?

1335
02:27:26,528 --> 02:27:30,589
I wasn't dismissed. I left that
job of my own volition.

1336
02:27:31,066 --> 02:27:33,193
You left the job! And I thought
that people take on...

1337
02:27:33,535 --> 02:27:36,003
... greater responsibilities after
marriage! - I wanted to rise in life.

1338
02:27:36,472 --> 02:27:40,340
- I wanted to become a successful
singer. - You must've received...

1339
02:27:40,743 --> 02:27:45,112
-.. several offers for singing.- l
did get an offer from Amar Kaushik.

1340
02:27:46,014 --> 02:27:50,246
From Amar Kaushik! Lovely! But
I don't think you have sung in...

1341
02:27:50,786 --> 02:27:55,120
-... any of his films. Or, have
you? - I had dropped the film.

1342
02:27:55,657 --> 02:28:01,994
-Left that too! Why? -Differences
had cropped up between us.

1343
02:28:02,731 --> 02:28:05,291
I see... differences!
And what did you do afterwards?

1344
02:28:05,968 --> 02:28:09,734
- I went back to the earlier job.
- At Copper Chimney? - Yes.

1345
02:28:10,305 --> 02:28:12,637
And how much salary
were you paid?

1346
02:28:16,478 --> 02:28:19,845
I didn't hear you, Mr. Rohit.
How much salary were you paid?

1347
02:28:20,682 --> 02:28:25,483
- 2500 rupees. - 2500?!
Down from 3000 to 2500!

1348
02:28:27,423 --> 02:28:33,851
You're the first person ever to
climb down the ladder to success.

1349
02:28:37,366 --> 02:28:41,029
And I do not think it to be
in your son's interest.

1350
02:28:42,404 --> 02:28:52,375
On September 13, you tried to rob
5000 rupees from the cashier.

1351
02:28:52,948 --> 02:28:56,606
No. I didn't try to rob.
I was asking for a loan.

1352
02:28:57,019 --> 02:29:01,053
You tried to take the money forcibly.
And when waiters in the restaurant...

1353
02:29:01,157 --> 02:29:03,349
... tried to apprehend you,
you fought with them physically.

1354
02:29:04,159 --> 02:29:06,252
I was merely taking a loan.
And I had intended to repay it.

1355
02:29:06,595 --> 02:29:10,895
Not only fisticuffs. Furniture was
broken and the restaurant losses.

1356
02:29:11,567 --> 02:29:16,504
For the crime, Mr. Rohit Kumar had
spend some time in a police-lockup.

1357
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:18,702
- ls it so, or, isn't it?
- Why don't you try to understand?

1358
02:29:18,774 --> 02:29:21,406
Please reply to my question in the
affirmative or the negative.

1359
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:24,535
I'm trying to give a reply. And l
can't do that in a mere ''yes'' or ''no''.

1360
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:27,774
I was taking an advance. It was
to be deducted form my salary.

1361
02:29:29,084 --> 02:29:32,019
My son had asked for gift on his
birthday. And, I promised the gift.

1362
02:29:32,588 --> 02:29:35,523
Stop shouting! Else, this court
holds you for contempt.

1363
02:29:40,329 --> 02:29:43,162
Were you confined in the police
lock up, or, weren't you?

1364
02:29:45,534 --> 02:29:47,729
- Yes. I was confined.
- Good.

1365
02:29:48,103 --> 02:29:54,906
- Now, do you consider yourself to
be a responsible father? - Yes.

1366
02:29:55,677 --> 02:30:04,346
Was your son was about to lose an
eye because you were irresponsible?

1367
02:30:05,754 --> 02:30:11,158
- Was your son Sunil about to lose
an eye? - He was playing in the park.

1368
02:30:11,493 --> 02:30:14,326
- And he fell down. - He fell
down because you were careless!

1369
02:30:14,663 --> 02:30:19,123
- And he was about to lose on eye!
- It was an accident.

1370
02:30:19,468 --> 02:30:22,437
- It could've happened to anyone.
- Didn't you tell Ms.Kiran that he...

1371
02:30:23,505 --> 02:30:25,234
...fell down because
you were careless...

1372
02:30:25,674 --> 02:30:28,268
... and that he was
about to lose an eye?

1373
02:30:31,513 --> 02:30:33,777
Tell us, Mr. Rohit, is it true?
Or, isn't it?

1374
02:30:39,521 --> 02:30:46,518
-Yes. -Do you concede that your son
could've lost an eye for your fault?

1375
02:30:47,896 --> 02:30:50,296
Yes.

1376
02:31:14,089 --> 02:31:22,428
I had no idea that my lawyer would
drag that into the court.

1377
02:31:25,334 --> 02:31:27,529
He had asked me
a lot of question.

1378
02:31:28,937 --> 02:31:30,666
I had merely
answered his questions.

1379
02:31:32,941 --> 02:31:38,379
I know you aren't at fault. Please
believe me. I didn't do it willingly.

1380
02:31:47,889 --> 02:31:51,825
After hearing the depositors made
by witnesses, this court has decided...

1381
02:31:52,194 --> 02:31:55,652
... that the child Sunil Kumar be
placed under Mrs. Kiran's custody.

1382
02:32:34,202 --> 02:32:40,766
Vacations start from today.
It's a month long vacation!

1383
02:32:41,276 --> 02:32:44,268
We'll go to Matheran during
the vacation, won't we?

1384
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:49,410
-Would you like an ice-cream?
-No. I want an ice-candy. -Come on.

1385
02:32:51,486 --> 02:32:53,818
Do you know something. Daddy?
All the kids in my class are going...

1386
02:32:54,056 --> 02:32:56,519
... to Simla on a school trip.
But, I'm not going with them.

1387
02:32:56,558 --> 02:33:01,552
I'll go to Matheran with you. We'll
have lots of fun out there, won't we?

1388
02:33:05,867 --> 02:33:10,270
We'll fly kites over there. And l
will carry the cricket kit with me too.

1389
02:33:45,574 --> 02:33:50,773
I want to tell you something.

1390
02:34:03,959 --> 02:34:06,519
This is a present from me.
It's a seasoned ball.

1391
02:34:07,395 --> 02:34:10,159
Do come over to play cricket.
We'll have a match.

1392
02:34:10,866 --> 02:34:15,963
Oh yes. You'll play for my team.
And we'll beat the grocer's team.

1393
02:34:17,239 --> 02:34:20,504
- Mr. Ramdayal called up to say
that the car is coming. - I see.

1394
02:34:20,876 --> 02:34:22,238
Carry the luggage down.

1395
02:34:23,011 --> 02:34:23,875
Let's go downstairs.

1396
02:34:38,994 --> 02:34:44,830
Don't cry, Sonu. Come on. You'll
enjoy yourself at Mummy's house.

1397
02:34:45,634 --> 02:34:47,534
You'll have lots
of toys over there.

1398
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:50,270
And I'll come down
to see you too.

1399
02:34:56,444 --> 02:35:00,676
- Take him down, Farida. I'll be
with you in sometime. - Very well.

1400
02:35:06,988 --> 02:35:08,148
Where's your bat, Sunil?

1401
02:35:09,558 --> 02:35:12,254
Where's your bat?... He must've
forgotten it. I'll fetch it.

1402
02:35:12,661 --> 02:35:14,128
Come along, son.

1403
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:16,320
Sonu has gone downstairs.

1404
02:36:18,059 --> 02:36:19,754
- I want to tell you something,
Rohit. - What?

1405
02:36:25,567 --> 02:36:27,865
This is Sonu's bat.
He forgot to take it.

1406
02:36:29,371 --> 02:36:32,101
I bought a full cricket
kit yesterday.

1407
02:36:32,874 --> 02:36:34,808
Why?! lsn't this bat
good for him anymore?

1408
02:36:35,410 --> 02:36:40,712
No. It's just that I remembered
that Sonu is fond of cricket.

1409
02:36:41,449 --> 02:36:44,907
Not only that. I've bought him
all the toys he could ever want.

1410
02:36:48,957 --> 02:36:52,654
I've made him a room that
looks just like the one here.

1411
02:36:53,528 --> 02:36:56,053
The same bed; a small table;
and a similar cupboard.

1412
02:36:56,998 --> 02:37:00,161
And I've painted the walls
the same shade of color.

1413
02:37:03,505 --> 02:37:10,570
All because I want to
make Sonu feel at home.

1414
02:37:16,418 --> 02:37:22,914
And then I realized that
this is his home.

1415
02:37:25,860 --> 02:37:27,953
A few articles can't make
a home for anyone.

1416
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:35,429
Sonu stays here.
This is his home.

1417
02:38:03,331 --> 02:38:10,328
Over the past few days, our lives
and our sentiments were laid bare.

1418
02:38:11,706 --> 02:38:15,267
You must've been hurt.
I know that.

1419
02:38:17,045 --> 02:38:21,709
And today I know that nothing
matters more than the relationship.

1420
02:38:24,652 --> 02:38:29,555
I'm sorry for everything
that has happened.

1421
02:38:34,362 --> 02:38:37,354
You're staying here,
Sonu... with your father.

1422
02:38:43,872 --> 02:38:45,100
This is your home.

1423
02:38:58,553 --> 02:39:03,513
This is your home too.

1424
