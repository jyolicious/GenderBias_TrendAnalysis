1
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,841
Suryavansham.. Suryavansham.

2
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,980
Suryavansham.. Suryavansham.

3
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,091
The light, the lion's roar.

4
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,799
The kind, honest.

5
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:14,339
Spark in your eyes
and glow on your face.

6
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:21,012
The brilliance of sun,
coolness of the moon.

7
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,816
You are the pilgrim for all of us.

8
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,923
You're Lord Ram of
this modern world.

9
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:41,167
Today on your birthday
we've come to wish you.

10
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:49,141
Suryavansham.. Suryavansham.

11
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,481
Suryavansham.. Suryavansham.

12
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:01,787
Suryavansham.. Suryavansham.

13
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,210
Hang on, sir.

14
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,547
Look at this.

15
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:37,053
Sister-in-law, your drape is not
held properly. Hold it properly.

16
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,185
Mother.

17
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,329
This is offering.

18
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,265
l'd gone to the
temple to pray for father.

19
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:55,539
First tell me. Have you
eaten something since morning?

20
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:04,081
l've kept a fast for
father's sake. Take this.

21
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,787
The whole snap.. Take the offering.
- Offering?

22
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,286
Where did it come from?

23
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:18,261
One of our servants has
prayed for your long life.

24
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,271
Once a person is born,
his life only shortens.

25
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,538
lt doesn't become long. Take this.

26
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,111
Start.
- Sir, has everybody come?

27
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,178
Yes, everybody has come.

28
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,083
Call Heera too.

29
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,456
Take the photo.

30
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,297
Greeting sir. - Greeting sir.
Greetings. Greetings.

31
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,932
Sit. Sit. Sit.

32
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,771
Accountant.
- Yes, sir.

33
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:09,781
Whenever l see these people,
my desire..

34
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:15,253
..to open a free hospital
for these poor people rouses.

35
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,020
God knows when my
dream will be fulfilled.

36
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,187
lt will be fulfilled, sir.

37
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,293
You've fulfilled the dream
of 18 people in this village.

38
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,195
Then how can your
wish not be fulfilled?

39
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,433
Sir.. sir.
- What happened, Haria?

40
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,902
Sir, my daughter..
- What happened to your daughter?

41
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,303
She was going to get
married in the next week.

42
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,308
Now she won't get married, sir.
- Why?

43
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,241
Kevada Thakur.

44
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,811
What did Kevada Thakur do?

45
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,851
My daughter works at
Kevada Thakur's place.

46
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,053
Yesterday she fell sick.

47
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,024
So my daughter Kamali went for work.

48
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,238
Wow!

49
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,929
Aren't you Parvati's daughter?
- Yes, sir.

50
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,465
You are going to get married,
aren't you? - Yes, sir.

51
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,332
Do you know about wedding night?

52
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,903
Do you know what it is all about?

53
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,143
Do you know how to please a man?

54
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,547
You don't know? Learn it from me.

55
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,184
A woman should be skilled in this.

56
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,389
Otherwise the husband
banishes the wife from the house.

57
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,990
Come.

58
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:11,369
No! No! - Come! No!
No! - Listen to me! Come!

59
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,500
Come.

60
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,839
Listen, come on!

61
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,778
l'll complain about this
in the village committee.

62
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,447
And l'll disgrace you
in the whole village.

63
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:26,780
l won't spare you.

64
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,988
Jagia, where did the girl go?
- Towards the fields, sir.

65
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,190
She was saying that she'll
complain to the village committee.

66
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,795
Really? There was no fire and
already the smoke is curling out.

67
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,201
Fool! Idiot!
- No!

68
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,002
You were stealing in Thakur's house?

69
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,070
You threatened him that..

70
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,371
..you will complaint against
him in the village committee.

71
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,242
l'll not spare you! Go in!

72
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,243
Lock her up!

73
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,422
Now who will marry my daughter, sir?

74
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,926
l can't even show
my face to anybody.

75
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,225
Accountant.
- Yes, sir.

76
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,994
Who is the inspector
in the police station?

77
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,128
He is some new inspector.

78
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,431
Go to the police
station and tell him..

79
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,100
..the girl is getting
married and leave her.

80
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,401
l'll handle all the proceedings.

81
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,369
Who is this Bhanu Pratap Thakur?

82
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,241
ls he SP.. DSP? Who is he?

83
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,309
SP and DSP respect him too.

84
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:29,843
He is an influential man and..

85
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,480
..the leader of this
village community.

86
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:35,786
l didn't get the post
of the police officer..

87
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,890
..by the favour of leaders. l
got this post after studying law.

88
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,359
Go and tell your
Bhanu Pratap Thakur.

89
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,866
This is a police station,
not a village community.

90
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,267
Where he can plough and reap a
harvest according to his will!

91
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,201
Understood! Get out!

92
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,183
Desh Rai Thakur.
- Sire.

93
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,754
Thakur Bhanu Pratap's man had come.

94
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:14,989
To get the girl bailed out.

95
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,027
Really? There was no fire
and the smoke is curling out.

96
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,230
l didn't release the girl.
- Don't even do that.

97
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:26,303
l'll pay you lavishly.
Listen. Do listen.

98
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,275
l'm sending stock of rice,
Ientil and pure ghee at your place.

99
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,909
Sire, you iust relax.

100
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,210
This girl will rot
in this prison only.

101
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,832
What law have you studied?

102
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,369
What do you know about law?
- Look..

103
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,304
Under the Indian
criminal procedure court..

104
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,943
..section 47 clause 2,
section 51, clause 2..

105
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:43,312
..section 50 and 57
and according to..

106
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,181
..the Supreme court
judgment dated 1983.

107
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,451
lf there is a
proceeding involving women..

108
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,853
..then a female police
officer should arrest her..

109
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,523
..and a female
officer should search her.

110
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,223
Did you do this? No.

111
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,795
Arrested women should be presented..

112
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,464
..before the court within 24 hours.

113
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,800
Did you do this? No.

114
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,805
lf for some reason she can't
be presented before the court..

115
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,142
..then she is kept in
the prison for females.

116
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,176
Did you do this? No.

117
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,850
And you say that you got
this post after studying law.

118
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,955
How did the police
department give you this post?

119
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,988
What law and order?

120
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,989
Accountant.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,891
Call the SP.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,896
Sir, could l have his number?

123
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,065
39522.

124
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,537
Hello.
- Sir, hang on. Sir.

125
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,408
Sir, this is Thakur
Bhanu Pratap Singh.

126
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,177
Sir, you? What can l do for you?

127
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:55,587
The police officer of our
village is teaching me law.

128
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,452
You're calling from
the police station?

129
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,854
Yes. Unfortunately.

130
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,823
Sir, give the
phone to the inspector.

131
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,290
Accountant.

132
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,860
Yes, sir.

133
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,797
Shameless! The man
sitting before you..

134
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,066
..is a high court in himself.

135
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,034
And court shouldn't be
called in the police station.

136
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:16,004
Do as he says.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,411
Release the girl.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,391
Sir, leave the prison's door open.

139
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,833
Dad, what happened? What's
the matter? - Move aside!

140
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,208
Have shame, rascal!

141
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,778
Just by wearing the
turban they think..

142
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:04,912
..that they've worn
the crown of respect.

143
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,346
You all are cowards!

144
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,822
You left behind loads of wealth,
but not a penny of respect.

145
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:17,061
The villagers respect, honour
and worship that Bhanu Pratap..

146
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,026
..and they don't respect me at all.

147
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,832
As if there is a
calamity of respect.

148
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,233
My disrespected ancestors!

149
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:30,006
Because of your inability,
today l'd to go to the prison too.

150
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,807
l'm ashamed that
hitherto l used to..

151
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,876
..feel proud of
useless Thakurs like you all.

152
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,077
lt's good that you all died.

153
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,347
Otherwise today l
would have killed you all.

154
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:44,454
l'll do the task that
you all couldn't do.

155
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,323
l'll ruin the sun of
that Suryavanshi forever.

156
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,065
Heera.
- Yes, brother.

157
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,233
Some special guests
are coming from the town.

158
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,268
Go to the guest house
and get the place cleaned.

159
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,503
They'll stay there only.

160
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,004
Fine.
- Okay.

161
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:09,977
Sister, sit straight.

162
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,445
Bhabhi, who is
coming from the village?

163
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,382
Brother-in-law, what
will you do by knowing it?

164
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,383
Yes, what will l do?

165
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,489
Then do the work that
your brother has given you.

166
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,123
Who are the guests who are coming?

167
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,860
l don't know. Must be
some special guests.

168
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,396
All guests are special, Heera.

169
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,201
But we become tired of serving them.

170
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,139
Phulva, your child is crying
and you're tending the goats.

171
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,875
What to do? l'm alone.
What all things will l manage?

172
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,346
Okay. We'll tend the goats.
You go and quieten your child.

173
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,478
Fine.

174
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,954
Who is walking in
the middle of the road?

175
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,059
Hey, move aside!

176
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,292
She's saying it to the goats not us!

177
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,497
ldiots! Can't you hear the horn!

178
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:04,166
We can hear. But
the goats can't hear.

179
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,433
Don't you have this
much of common sense?

180
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,200
What did you say?

181
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,803
l spoke in English.
You won't understand.

182
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,207
Uncle, go and move those idiots.
- Fine.

183
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,109
l'll teach them a lesson.

184
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,779
Are you tending to the goats or..

185
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,882
..taking a newlywed
bride to the theatre?

186
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,318
We don't know how to take
newlywed brides to the theatre.

187
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,052
We're not married.

188
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,225
Only bachelors can do this.
Now look at me.

189
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,828
Uncle, what are you doing?
Move them quickly.

190
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,135
Ma'am, these are goats. Not some
athlete, that they'll run like sheep.

191
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,537
Where are you going
with so many goats?

192
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,806
To get them admitted
to engineering college.

193
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,041
Hey! Do you think l'm a fool!

194
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,209
This road goes towards Bharatpur?

195
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,813
lf you go this way, then
your hand will get hurt.

196
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:53,815
Keep your hand down and then go.

197
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,518
And listen.
- What?

198
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,151
Why are you going to Bharatpur?

199
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:02,091
l'll buy 2 buffaloes and get
them admitted to medical college.

200
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,960
ldiot! Hang on. Don't go from there.

201
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,294
The bridge is out.

202
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,764
Bridge is out?
- Yes.

203
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,201
Do one thing. Go back 10 kms.

204
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,771
Then take a right, then take a
Ieft, then again take a right..

205
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,873
..you will find Bharatpur.

206
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,876
Let me sit.
- What happened, uncle?

207
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,983
Go back 10 kms. The
bridge is out further.

208
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,248
Oh my God!

209
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,452
Where did you..

210
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:35,057
That girl called us goats,
that man called us donkey.

211
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:37,459
Let them die. They'll
wander in the jungle.

212
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:38,792
Then they'll come to
their senses. Come.

213
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,232
Hi, Narendra.
- Mr. Karan.

214
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,135
He's my younger brother, Varun. -
Greetings. Hi. - Hello. - Narendra.

215
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,969
Mummy and daddy are
nowhere to be seen.

216
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:52,809
There was a case hearing in
the court. So they couldn't come.

217
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,007
They'll come by tomorrow.
- Okay.

218
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,878
By the way, she's my sister Radha.
- Greetings.

219
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,111
Mr. Karan.
- Greetings.

220
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,950
And he is my uncle, my
father's best friend. - l see.

221
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,218
Retired Maior Ranieet Singh.
How do you do, sir? - Hello.

222
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,152
Come sir.
- Welcome.

223
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,155
Please.
- Come, dear. - Come.

224
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,024
Did you have any
trouble on the route?

225
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,896
No. We iust met 2
shepherds who fooled us.

226
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,401
They made us travel 20 miles extra.
And wasted our time.

227
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,367
Who? l don't understand.

228
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,939
Heera! Come here!

229
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,012
Hide your face carefully.

230
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:41,790
Who are the
shepherds in our village?

231
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:44,492
Nobody.
- What?

232
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,527
Nobody.

233
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,465
Who could it be?
Anyway, we'll find out.

234
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,367
You take a rest.
- Okay. - Please.

235
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,503
Heera.
- Yes. - Take care of them.

236
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,204
Okay, brother.

237
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,010
Hey! Bring the luggage from the car.

238
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,454
So heavy.

239
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,959
They've made you a servant.
- Come. That's it.

240
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:24,202
Wow! What a beauty! Beautiful!

241
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,372
This is an old knife.

242
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,879
Uncle, this is not a knife.
It is a sword.

243
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,017
l know it is a sword. It
was a slip of the tongue.

244
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,459
Wow! The servants here
read newspaper. - Stop!

245
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:52,461
Why are you both hiding your
face since the time we've come?

246
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,796
Today Lord Hanuman
has kept a fast for us.

247
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,933
l mean, we have kept
Lord Hanuman's fast.

248
00:19:58,098 --> 00:19:59,835
Today we won't see any girl's face.

249
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,201
Radha.
- Yes.

250
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,270
This voice is very familiar.

251
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,941
You must have heard it.
On B.B.C or Doordarshan.

252
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:10,079
No. This is shepherds' voice.

253
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:11,913
Hey! Turn around.

254
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:14,882
Show your face.

255
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:16,083
Okay.

256
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:17,217
Turn around.

257
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,353
Remove the newspaper.

258
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,396
You guys? l'll say it to Thakur sir.

259
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,832
No, no. Look, don't say
anything to Thakur sir.

260
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,899
Henceforth we won't trouble you.

261
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,834
Please forgive us.

262
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,570
Just saying sorry is not sufficient.

263
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,273
You'll have to hold
your ears and sit.

264
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,410
Yes, you do it.

265
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,278
You too.
- Me too.

266
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,919
Fine. Now go.

267
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,153
Let's go.

268
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,933
'These two made us
travel for 20 kms# 

269
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,333
'l'll teach them a lesson# 

270
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,501
Hey!

271
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,036
Come here.

272
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:16,246
ls there any laundry? l
mean one who irons clothes.

273
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,446
No, you can tell it as laundry.

274
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,181
l know English.

275
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,951
He is illiterate.

276
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,886
l didn't ask your bio-data.

277
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,888
Tell me, is there a laundry here?

278
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,894
There is laundry, sweet maker,
tailor, butcher, washer man..

279
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,427
Fine. Come with me.

280
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,203
Take the clothes. Go
and get them ironed.

281
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,406
l?
- Yes, you.

282
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,508
Don't you remember,
what your boss had said?

283
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,308
Do what work we give you.

284
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,480
That is fine. But these
clothes are already ironed.

285
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,791
Now there is a need for ironing.
- Yes.

286
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,491
Then why are you looking
at it? Go and take it.

287
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,526
Yes!

288
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,264
Hey, you.

289
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,540
Yes, l'm calling you.
- My name is Dharmendra.

290
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,540
Heera calls me Mindra lovingly.

291
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:22,946
l don't know all that.
You're just a fool for me.

292
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:28,118
Do one thing. Take my clothes.
And get them ironed. Take it.

293
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,818
What are you staring at? Take it.

294
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:32,887
Shall l get it ironed
after sprinkling water?

295
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:35,057
Yes. And use drinking water.

296
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:39,361
Why drinking water.
l'll use mineral water.

297
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:46,967
What are you doing?

298
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,569
We have to wet the
clothes before ironing it.

299
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:52,041
Beggar. l'll make the dogs
of this village run after him.

300
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,978
Mindra. Again the
clothes will get dirty.

301
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,945
Again we'll have to wash it.
Again we'll be told to iron it.

302
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,346
We're treated worst than a servant.

303
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,783
We've to do what they say.
We don't have any status.

304
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:03,083
Heera, this is not fair.

305
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,452
Mindra, listen to me.
- What?

306
00:23:04,918 --> 00:23:07,322
Look, they are special guests.
- So?

307
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:08,856
Don't shout.

308
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:10,959
Till the time they're here,
for my sake keep quiet.

309
00:23:11,492 --> 00:23:14,531
What for your sake! You don't
feel anything. Come, let's go.

310
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,367
Left. A bit on the right.
- Is this fine?

311
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:21,069
Forward. A bit on the side.
- What are you doing, uncle?

312
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,071
Are you taking my
photo or making me parade?

313
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,440
What to do? l can't see
your face in the camera.

314
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:28,010
Sir, you'll see the face
only if you remove the cover.

315
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,280
This is camera. No
need to remove the cover.

316
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,347
Yes, it is a camera, not a cooker.

317
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,818
l know. Do you think l'm a donkey?

318
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,488
Hitherto l've never seen a donkey
taking a photo. What did you say?

319
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,321
l'm iust moving my mouth.

320
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,959
Shepherd, l'd given
you clothes for ironing.

321
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:45,092
Where is that?

322
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:49,165
Military sir, little mistake.
- What?

323
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,935
The laundryman was drunk.
He fell on the ground.

324
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:55,838
And the hot iron
fell on the clothes.

325
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,204
All the clothes were burnt.

326
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,508
With great difficulty.
l've saved a collar.

327
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,977
You can use it. Greetings.

328
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:15,124
Hey! What are you doing with my car?

329
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,391
Do you want to ruin
this too like my clothes?

330
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,794
l'm washing it. Cleaning it.

331
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,329
May you rot in hell!
Where is the other one?

332
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:22,496
He has gone for lunch.

333
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,298
Do you eat the whole day?

334
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,033
We don't eat
without working like you.

335
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,471
What did you say?
- l was just moving my mouth.

336
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,939
Stop moving your mouth. And
start using your hands and legs.

337
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,540
Fool!

338
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,809
Sorry, sorry.
- What does this mean?

339
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,878
l said sorry. To
hell with your sorry!

340
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,817
Hey! - You're cleaning
my car with a broom?

341
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:43,451
l'm cleaning it with a broom.
l'm not using sword.

342
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,252
You!
- What are you doing?

343
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,322
lt is not real.
- Really?

344
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:55,896
Now do it.

345
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:09,109
Sir. Sir.

346
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,280
Your killing looks.
- Give me something.

347
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,452
l'm hungry since the past 2 days.
- What!

348
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,056
Throw the money, sir.

349
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,463
l think you're in a
worst condition than me.

350
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,932
l give more than this to beggars.

351
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,332
Hey! Come here.

352
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,235
From where did you
get these clothes?

353
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,538
The owner of this
bungalow gave it to me.

354
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,241
May God make him the
owner of garments' mill!

355
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:42,209
Where is the collar?

356
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:44,814
He removed it. He was
saying that a city dog..

357
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,815
..has come in the house.

358
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:47,981
Dog!
- Yes.

359
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:49,451
He wanted a collar for his neck.

360
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:52,820
See there. The owner has come.

361
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:57,357
So he is the owner?

362
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,163
Sir, why are you nervous?

363
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:02,897
He is not a bigger donator than you.

364
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:05,333
Look at this. This
beggar gave me 10 paisa.

365
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:10,439
Owner? What?
- Did you call him?

366
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:11,839
She is calling you.
- Who is it?

367
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:16,512
Hey, where did he go? Where are you?

368
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:22,486
My dear one. My little child.

369
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,984
My dear one.

370
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,787
What are you doing,
Phulva? Make the child quiet!

371
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:26,920
Why are you making the child cry?

372
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,790
lf he is not keeping quiet
even after giving him milk..

373
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:29,923
..then what can l do?

374
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,058
Then give him more.

375
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,326
Keep quiet.

376
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:34,462
Keep quiet.

377
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,302
Keep quite!

378
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:46,810
My heart, you are crazy.

379
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:51,814
Sir is singing.
Now he'll keep quiet.

380
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:55,351
You are crazy, l agree to it.

381
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,106
My heart, you are crazy.

382
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:21,512
You are crazy, l agree to it.

383
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:26,216
You sigh each and every moment.

384
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,787
Why are you afraid to say it?

385
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:35,025
My heart, you are crazy.

386
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:38,358
The rivers know that there
is thirst in the ocean too.

387
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:43,326
l agree that the darkness is deep.

388
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:47,798
Who has forbid you?

389
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:51,366
Light the flame of the stars.

390
00:28:51,832 --> 00:28:56,073
Even dreams come true.

391
00:28:57,103 --> 00:29:01,277
l've heard so.

392
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:05,047
My heart, you are crazy.

393
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:09,452
You are mad, l agree to it.

394
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:14,290
You sigh each and every moment.

395
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:18,929
Why are you afraid to say it?

396
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,224
Uncle, how much sugar for you?

397
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,993
Just a bit. Not much.

398
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,061
Oh, mummy and daddy have come.

399
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,967
Hi, mom! Him dad!
- Hi, dad.

400
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,536
How is everything here?
l'm fine, mummy.

401
00:30:02,068 --> 00:30:03,838
lt's beautiful.
- What is beautiful?

402
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:06,909
The village is beautiful,
people here are beautiful.

403
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,812
Come, uncle. Heera.
- Yes.

404
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,215
Bring the luggage.
- Yes. Come. Come.

405
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,819
lt's a beautiful place. Radha.
- Yes.

406
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,824
Why are you saying to him
to carry the luggage? - Him?

407
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,424
Yes.
- He's the servant.

408
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:24,859
Servant.
- Yes.

409
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,394
His face is similar to Thakur sir.

410
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,905
Dear.. are you Thakur
Bhanu Pratap's son? - Yes.

411
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,508
Why are you carrying this luggage?

412
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:42,411
Keep it. l'll carry it.
- No, no. You're my guest.

413
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:43,845
lt is my duty to serve you.

414
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,846
Dear, it's your greatness.

415
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:48,551
But l don't like it. Give it to me.

416
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:51,453
You go home and make
arrangements for tomorrow's function.

417
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,120
Function?

418
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,256
Yes. Tomorrow your sister is
getting engaged to my son.

419
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,494
Why? Don't you know?

420
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:09,302
Sit.
- Sit.

421
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,806
She is our relative.
- Greetings.

422
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:27,960
Greetings. - Greetings.
Greetings. - God bless you.

423
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:30,958
Greetings.

424
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:35,195
Sit down, child.

425
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:40,335
Priest has come. Let's ask him
for the auspicious time. Yes.

426
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,037
So priest, which day is auspicious.

427
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:46,074
Thakur sir, for the
wedding 10th is good day.

428
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,913
But for the give away 10th and
1 1th, both the days are bad.

429
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,316
So, we'll arrange for the give
away on the 12th. Fine. - Great.

430
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,299
Grandpa. l love you, grandpa.

431
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:14,437
A knee, a toe and here we go..
Listen. Where's Mr. Heera?

432
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:16,069
l don't know.

433
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,441
Uncle never comes before grandpa.
- Why?

434
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:22,143
Grandpa doesn't like uncle.

435
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,253
Enough, mother.
- One more.

436
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:34,555
Open your mouth.

437
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:40,029
Your father fixed your sister's
engagement just out the blue.

438
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:44,233
l had no idea dear,
that you don't know.

439
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:47,267
What would l have done
even if l'd known, mother?

440
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:53,276
l know that my status in
this house is that of a servant.

441
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:57,279
And servant shouldn't be
told each and every thing.

442
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,481
Mother.

443
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:04,786
Mother, if there is reincarnation..

444
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,425
..then l would like to be
your and father's son again.

445
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,794
What l couldn't get in this birth..

446
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:15,230
..maybe l'll get it in that life.

447
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,473
Mindra. - What? Again you
want to get your clothes ironed?

448
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,274
l want to know something
about Mr. Heera from you.

449
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:29,877
Why are you looking like this?

450
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,181
Because hitherto nobody has
addressed Heera as Mr. Heera.

451
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:35,516
What do you want to know?

452
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:38,286
Thakur sir is an
influential figure in this village.

453
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,822
One of his sons is doctor
and the other is engineer.

454
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:42,823
Then why is Mr. Heera like this?

455
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,393
Why is he treated like a servant?

456
00:33:45,992 --> 00:33:47,294
Even he is Thakur sir's son.

457
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:50,266
Yes. But Thakur doesn't
consider him as his son.

458
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,565
Why?

459
00:33:54,568 --> 00:33:56,103
Heera attended
school when he was a kid.

460
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:58,239
But he was very weak in studies.

461
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,777
He always used to flunk in exams.

462
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,781
Thinking that he'll get
father's beatings if he went home..

463
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:09,954
..with O marks, he used
to convert O into 100.

464
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:13,489
But still he would get beatings.
- Why?

465
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:17,794
Because he didn't know how
many zeros there are in 100.

466
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:21,329
He sometimes used to put 4
zeros and sometimes 5 zeros.

467
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:25,366
Heera was not at all
interested in studies.

468
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,069
He used to go to school
only for Gauri's sake.

469
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:30,371
Gauri? Who is Gauri?

470
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:32,907
Thakur sir's friend's daughter.

471
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:37,312
Gauri's parents died when she
was a child, in a car accident.

472
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,482
Thakur sir brought Gauri home.

473
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:43,853
And Gauri and Heera used
to go to school together.

474
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:48,258
Heera liked Gauri.
Gauri wanted to study.

475
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,193
But Heera always used to
distract her with games.

476
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,360
Gauri could never study.

477
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:56,163
One day when both of
them went to school..

478
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,404
'Stand up. Why didn't you
do your homework? Tell me# 

479
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,069
'Forward your hand# 

480
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:06,175
'Mother! Mother!'

481
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,511
'Mother!'

482
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,281
'Let's go, Gauri# 

483
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:23,357
'Heera, get up# 

484
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,794
'Along with the books,
Heera's education..

485
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:26,927
..also got washed
away in the water# 

486
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:33,336
Heera hated the school
where Gauri was beaten.

487
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:37,306
From that day, he didn't
even look at that school.

488
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,808
Thinking that in the
company of Heera..

489
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:42,811
..Gauri's studies
will be badly affected..

490
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,446
..Thakur sir sent
Gauri to study in the city.

491
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:46,914
Heera and Gauri got separated.

492
00:35:47,448 --> 00:35:50,954
They grew up separately.
Heera was always sad.

493
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,386
But there was one
source of happiness.

494
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,456
Gauri used to come from
the city on every Saturday.

495
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,826
Saturday and
Sunday were the 2 days..

496
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:59,193
..that filled Heera with ioy.

497
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:52,816
My heart, you are crazy.

498
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:57,053
You are crazy, l agree to it.

499
00:36:57,918 --> 00:37:01,825
You sigh each and every moment.

500
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:06,129
Why are you afraid to say it?

501
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:17,007
My heart, you are crazy.

502
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:21,277
You are mad, l agree to it.

503
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:26,050
You sigh each and every moment.

504
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:30,220
Why are you afraid to say it?

505
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:35,058
My heart, you are crazy.

506
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:28,882
Nobody understands
the language of silence.

507
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:34,184
Flowers don't blossom
in the nuptial chaplet.

508
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:38,387
Even after meeting
they don't unite.

509
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,091
God knows whose fault it is.

510
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:46,997
These unknown paths.

511
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:51,969
Will give the
direction of the destination.

512
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:56,039
My heart, you are crazy.

513
00:38:56,803 --> 00:39:00,242
You are crazy, l agree to it.

514
00:39:00,974 --> 00:39:05,015
You sigh each and every moment.

515
00:39:05,378 --> 00:39:09,352
Why are you afraid to say it?

516
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:14,191
My heart, you are crazy.

517
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:06,113
The rivers know that there
is thirst in the ocean too.

518
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,081
l agree that the darkness is deep.

519
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:15,318
Who has forbid you?

520
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:19,054
Light the flame of the stars.

521
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,393
Even dreams come true.

522
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:29,066
l've heard so.

523
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:33,070
My heart, you are crazy.

524
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:37,240
You are crazy, l agree to it.

525
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:41,945
You sigh each and every moment.

526
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:46,416
Why are you afraid to say it?

527
00:40:47,013 --> 00:40:50,854
You sigh each and every moment.

528
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,054
Why are you afraid to say it?

529
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:03,431
Gauri.
- Hi.

530
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:08,804
Give it to me. - No, no problem.
No, give it to me. Come.

531
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,807
How are you?
- Fine. l just have a slight fever.

532
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:14,308
Then come l'll take you to the
doctor. No, no need for that.

533
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:20,380
Open your mouth.

534
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:26,824
Doctor.
- Hey! What?

535
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:30,325
Letter A is here. What are
you telling her to show?

536
00:41:31,057 --> 00:41:33,294
Really? What do you
think of yourself?

537
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,831
l became a doctor without
any studies? l'm M.B.B.S.

538
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:39,503
M.B.B.S! l told her
to open her mouth.

539
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:51,446
Slight fever. l'll
give you injection.

540
00:41:52,078 --> 00:41:54,215
No, doctor. No iniections.

541
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,916
lf you want you can give medicines.
Injection hurts.

542
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:57,418
lt's a small iniection.
It won't hurt.

543
00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:58,552
Even kids take it nowadays.

544
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,123
No, no. Doctor, listen to me.
Don't give her injection.

545
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:02,255
lt will hurt her a lot.

546
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:04,359
Okay, you give iniection.
You give tablets.

547
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:06,194
You give medicines. l'm going.

548
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,129
Doctor. - Am l the
doctor or you are the doctor?

549
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:09,897
No, you're the doctor, but..

550
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:11,799
Okay, you give me the iniection.

551
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:12,933
l'll check whether
it hurts me or not.

552
00:42:12,999 --> 00:42:15,437
Ma'am, ask him to get out!
- Heera, go out.

553
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,371
Gauri, you..
- Please, go out.

554
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:22,378
Come. - Go, go. Okay,
l'm going. - Give medicine!

555
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:28,016
You saw? He gave her iniection.

556
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:30,552
lt's iust a slight fever
and he gave her injection.

557
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:32,886
lt must be hurting her so much.

558
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:34,288
lt will get well. Go.
- Thanks.

559
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:39,462
Show it to me. Is it paining?
- No.

560
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:42,831
You sit in the car, l'll iust come.
- Where are you going?

561
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:45,835
l'm going to ask him when to
come next. Go. Come. - Go.

562
00:42:47,033 --> 00:42:51,409
Yes, it's done. What? What?
- Yes, we'll explain. Nothing.

563
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:56,581
Just a small test.
- Test? What test? To show.. - What?

564
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:58,145
To show how much iniection hurts.

565
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:01,451
What?
- Hold this. Turn around, turn.

566
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,986
Now you know what pain is!

567
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,355
You're always giving
injections for petty matters.

568
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:12,193
Doctor, shall l give
injection to patient no 8?

569
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:14,395
No iniection! Only tablets!

570
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:16,330
He is ruining our reputation.

571
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:20,001
He created a scene with
the villagers in the show.

572
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:22,804
He misbehaved with a
doctor in the city.

573
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:24,806
There is a vast
difference between him and them!

574
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:28,344
Shall l say something?
Get him married.

575
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,112
Responsibilities will reform him.

576
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:34,916
Which girl will
marry this useless guy!

577
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:38,119
No need to search for a girl.

578
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:44,396
Girl is right here in
this house. Yes, Gauri.

579
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:47,229
Have you gone mad!
l've raised Gauri.

580
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,163
This doesn't mean
that l'll ruin her life.

581
00:43:49,563 --> 00:43:51,867
Gauri.. Ioves Heera.

582
00:43:53,232 --> 00:43:57,007
Yes, father. brother
Heera loves Gauri.

583
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:01,144
You know. Both have loved
each other since childhood.

584
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:05,047
lf you don't believe me..
then ask Gauri.

585
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:10,384
There is no need to ask Gauri.

586
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:13,422
l know that she
won't refuse my decision.

587
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,190
lf she loves this useless fellow..

588
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,927
..then call the priest
and fix an auspicious date.

589
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:31,405
Aunt! Aunt!

590
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:38,914
Gauri has come.
Come. Do come, Gauri.

591
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:42,350
Sister, what is going on?

592
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,120
Preparation for your
marriage is going on.

593
00:44:46,086 --> 00:44:47,154
My marriage?

594
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,392
Yes. Father has fixed
your marriage with Heera.

595
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,032
Heera had asked for the boon
that if he gets to marry Gauri..

596
00:44:57,864 --> 00:44:59,834
..then he'll bow his head at
the threshold of every temple.

597
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:02,837
And he'll offer
coconut to every idol.

598
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:06,975
One day we were going to
the temple to offer coconut.

599
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:09,376
When we saw that a girl
had jumped into the water.

600
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,781
Heera iumped to save that girl.

601
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,848
He got her out of the water.

602
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:17,184
That girl was none other than Gauri.

603
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:27,028
Gauri, what has happened to you?

604
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:29,797
Why do you want to kill yourself?

605
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,366
Now even our marriage is fixed.

606
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:37,541
That's why l want to die. So
that l don't have to marry you.

607
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:44,180
The convict who is hanged
is asked for his last wish.

608
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:49,085
But your father didn't
ask my first or last wish.

609
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,889
Why? He raised me up.

610
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,322
Does it mean that whatever he
decides, l'll give my consent?

611
00:45:59,526 --> 00:46:00,861
There is nothing common between us.

612
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:08,273
l'm educated, you're illiterate.
Do you have any identity?

613
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:11,907
You live like a
servant in your own house.

614
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,213
ln this modern world,
you'll living an orthodox life.

615
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,518
What will l say to
my educated friends?

616
00:46:24,784 --> 00:46:26,788
That my husband doesn't know..

617
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,790
..the history, geography of life?

618
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:31,192
He's iust the way he was at birth.

619
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:33,393
Only his height has increased.

620
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:35,529
And he has started wearing clothes.

621
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:41,904
Gauri, don't you love Heera?

622
00:46:42,035 --> 00:46:45,207
People love animals too.
But they don't marry them.

623
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:49,812
lf l knew.. that
your Father would get..

624
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:52,815
..me married to you in
return for his favours.

625
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:56,818
Then after my parents died..

626
00:46:56,883 --> 00:46:59,822
..l wouldn't have
stayed in your house.

627
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:04,427
l would have gone to some
orphanage. - Gauri, enough.

628
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:07,094
Now.. no need to say anything else.

629
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,203
Father had the trust
that you won't refuse him.

630
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:16,905
That's why he didn't
ask for your wish.

631
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:20,775
lt's good that you said this to me.

632
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,879
lf you'd said it to father,
then it would have had hurt him.

633
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:26,781
He would have
regretted his whole life..

634
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:30,320
..that how did he make the
decision without asking you.

635
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:38,796
lf you don't want to marry me,
then don't marry me.

636
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:43,900
l'll say to father that l
don't want to marry Gauri.

637
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,804
As it is, l mean nothing to him.
l'll become more worthless.

638
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:52,808
But if you become
worthless in the eyes of somebody..

639
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:54,342
..this l can't tolerate.

640
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,080
Go, Gauri.

641
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,854
Heera is no longer a hurdle for you.

642
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:23,137
What l'd doubted happened!

643
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:28,778
The God that l never saw,
l can see Him everywhere.

644
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:31,145
But l can't understand
this useless fellow.

645
00:48:34,514 --> 00:48:37,386
Heera, what happened? You..

646
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:38,519
Don't ask for any clarifications!

647
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:41,856
l iust want answer to one question.

648
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,024
Will he marry Gauri or no?

649
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,201
No.

650
00:48:58,071 --> 00:48:59,841
Since then Heera became
nonexistent for his father.

651
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:03,077
He didn't let Gauri lose her
respect before his father.

652
00:49:03,877 --> 00:49:04,945
But he himself lost his respect.

653
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,749
Thakur got Gauri
married to someone else..

654
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:10,419
..without finding out the truth.

655
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:41,149
Heera had lighted the lamp of love.

656
00:49:42,416 --> 00:49:44,252
But that poor fellow
got only darkness.

657
00:49:46,252 --> 00:49:47,521
l have one request.

658
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:51,158
lf you can't heal Heera's wound..

659
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:53,461
..then don't try to
dig those old wounds.

660
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:17,054
Mindra, hitherto l shouted at you,
made you slog like a donkey.

661
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:18,987
l hope you are not angry with me.

662
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,459
What are you saying?
You're like my elder brother.

663
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:25,326
And as it is, if
hen kicks the mouse..

664
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:26,560
..then the mouse doesn't feel bad.

665
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,429
Why are you standing? Sit.

666
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:31,298
Not on the floor. Sit on the chair.

667
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:34,303
No, sir. My status doesn't
allow me to sit with you.

668
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:35,569
Oh my friend!

669
00:50:36,069 --> 00:50:37,137
Shall l make a peg for you?

670
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:40,175
No, sir. l'm not worthy
enough to have a drink with you.

671
00:50:40,441 --> 00:50:41,910
Forget it.

672
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:43,043
Class and status are not
taken into consideration..

673
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:44,177
..while drinking.

674
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:46,914
Take this.

675
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:50,853
Do drink. Drink this.

676
00:50:53,253 --> 00:50:56,058
l'm drinking it iust to please you.

677
00:51:03,464 --> 00:51:04,532
Tell me one thing, Mindra.

678
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:07,001
You're educated, hard working..

679
00:51:07,468 --> 00:51:10,841
..then why are you
working like a dog.

680
00:51:11,004 --> 00:51:13,208
Then what should l go?
Become a dacoit?

681
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:16,345
Hey!
- l mean Become a dacoit, sir.

682
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:18,246
You can do one thing.
- Yes.

683
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,416
You can work, start a business.

684
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:22,484
lf you don't have money, then
l'll give it to you. - No, no.

685
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:26,355
Do keep it. - l don't want it.
Come on, keep it. Take it.

686
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,428
Mindra, tell me one thing.
- Yes.

687
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:38,569
The girl who had come to
keep all this.. how is she?

688
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:43,839
Just like a girl.
- Even l know that.

689
00:51:44,838 --> 00:51:50,215
l mean.. you understand what
l'm trying to say, don't you?

690
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:55,150
Yes. Yes. l'll ask
Zalim Singh and tell you.

691
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:58,119
Who is Zalim Singh?
- Her husband.

692
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:01,054
Husband?
- Yes.

693
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:04,025
A few days back a man had
asked the same question.

694
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:07,062
Zalim Singh had cut
his hands and legs.

695
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:09,396
Nowadays he's in the prison.

696
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:11,398
He will be released on the 28th.

697
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,971
What is today's date?
26th. Day after tomorrow.

698
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:34,256
So military, give me a cigarette.

699
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,323
Military?
- Give me a cigarette.

700
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:38,959
Hurry up.

701
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:49,069
Who will light it? Your father?
- Hey!

702
00:52:59,178 --> 00:53:01,784
So what were saying
about that servant?

703
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:03,083
What do you want to do with her?

704
00:53:03,149 --> 00:53:04,986
No, no. Nothing.
- No, you were saying something.

705
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:06,888
Nothing.
- You were saying.

706
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:09,858
lt slipped from my mouth.
Forget it. It was nothing.

707
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:11,859
Give me more alcohol.

708
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:14,930
Hang on. Don't drink more.
You've got a high.

709
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,096
Am l your servant?

710
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,799
When you'll say, l'll drink.

711
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:19,233
And when you'll say,
l'll stop drinking.

712
00:53:19,298 --> 00:53:20,468
Look, you're misbehaving.

713
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,437
Am l misbehaving or
you're misbehaving?

714
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:26,375
First you come and tell me to
fix you up with that village girl.

715
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:28,810
And then you say..
- Quite.

716
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:34,084
What are you saying? You
want to do something with girls.

717
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:41,494
People like you who.. Sometimes in
my heart. Never think about this.

718
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:43,424
Rascal!

719
00:53:48,028 --> 00:53:50,466
Greetings.
- Greetings. Come. - Greetings.

720
00:53:56,437 --> 00:53:57,505
Greetings. Come.

721
00:54:00,306 --> 00:54:02,143
Welcome, Mohan.
- Hello, Bharat.

722
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:03,944
Hello.

723
00:54:29,836 --> 00:54:30,904
Come.

724
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:38,946
Greetings.
- Greetings.

725
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,382
How are you?
- Fine. - Where is Mohan?

726
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:55,297
Have this. Do take it.

727
00:55:31,465 --> 00:55:32,800
Greetings.
- Greetings. Come.

728
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:34,536
Greetings.
- Greetings.

729
00:56:05,165 --> 00:56:06,233
Give it to Govind. Come.

730
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,235
Brother.
- Yes.

731
00:56:08,402 --> 00:56:09,771
She is my sister-in-law, Usha.

732
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:11,506
She was in America
during my wedding.

733
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:14,009
Now that she has come, l want to
introduce her to you all. - l see.

734
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:15,443
He is brother Karan.
He is brother Bharat.

735
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:16,777
Greetings.
- Greetings.

736
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:18,345
Heera.
- Yes, brother.

737
00:56:18,412 --> 00:56:20,181
Give 2 cold drinks here.
- Please.

738
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,049
Excuse me.

739
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:24,953
Bhabhi, who is he? You
didn't introduce him.

740
00:56:26,787 --> 00:56:29,792
He is not a VIP that
l'll introduce him.

741
00:56:33,026 --> 00:56:34,194
He is a useless fellow.

742
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:36,263
That's why he's
living like a servant.

743
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:43,537
Thank you.

744
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:46,407
Hang on, Mr. Heera.

745
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:49,544
Madhuri, Kavita,
Rani, please come here.

746
00:56:51,545 --> 00:56:54,817
l'd told you all that l want
to introduce an important man.

747
00:56:55,148 --> 00:56:56,885
He is that man. Heera Thakur.

748
00:56:59,453 --> 00:57:03,026
Mr. Heera, these are my friends.
Madhuri, Kavita -Greetings.

749
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:04,157
Greetings. Rani. Sita.

750
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:08,898
He looks very simple. But
he is a great personality.

751
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:11,232
lf we give alms to somebody,
then what do we give?

752
00:57:11,498 --> 00:57:13,401
Clothes, food, money.

753
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,104
Or at the most we'll give
them shelter at our home.

754
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:22,213
But he is that man who gave
his dreams, happiness for alms.

755
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:27,216
The one who took his
alms forgot his favours.

756
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,521
But he never minded. He's so great.

757
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:37,092
You can go. Let's go.

758
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,529
What's the matter, Gauri?

759
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:44,299
Sister, who is she?
- She is Urmila's sister-in-law.

760
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:48,972
She is studying l.A.S.
- Oh! That's why she's so proud.

761
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:20,033
What happened?

762
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:22,970
Why did you call me here?

763
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:35,385
l'm wondering. From
where to start, how to start.

764
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,086
Say clearly what you want to say.

765
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,888
Will you marry me?

766
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:47,796
l like your virtues and goodness.

767
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:52,033
Go home. Your parents
must be worried for you.

768
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:53,468
This is not the
answer of my question.

769
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:02,745
llliterates don't have
answers for literate people.

770
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:04,044
Yes, they do.

771
00:59:13,487 --> 00:59:18,262
My heart, you are crazy.

772
00:59:22,362 --> 00:59:26,971
You are crazy, l agree to it.

773
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,987
My heart, you are crazy.

774
00:59:44,518 --> 00:59:48,291
You are crazy, l agree to it.

775
00:59:49,055 --> 00:59:52,996
You sigh each and every moment.

776
00:59:53,293 --> 00:59:57,267
Why are you afraid to say it?

777
00:59:57,864 --> 01:00:02,105
My heart, you are crazy.

778
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:40,982
The rivers know that there
is thirst in the ocean too.

779
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:45,849
l agree that the darkness is deep.

780
01:00:46,212 --> 01:00:50,086
Who has forbid you?

781
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:53,856
Light the flame of the stars.

782
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,462
Even dreams come true.

783
01:00:59,392 --> 01:01:03,801
l've heard so.

784
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:07,804
My heart, you are crazy.

785
01:01:08,234 --> 01:01:12,041
You are crazy, l agree to it.

786
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:16,480
You sigh each and every moment.

787
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:20,850
Why are you afraid to say it?

788
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:25,823
My heart, you are crazy.

789
01:01:25,919 --> 01:01:29,826
You are crazy, l agree to it.

790
01:01:30,223 --> 01:01:34,197
You sigh each and every moment.

791
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:38,836
Why are you afraid to say it?

792
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,793
l'm not expressing
pity on your broken heart.

793
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:07,795
But l've come thinking
that after uniting with you..

794
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:10,499
..my heart will never break.

795
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:18,075
Look.. l don't see eye to
eye with my family and fate.

796
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,410
l can't handle sorrow or ioy.

797
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:23,512
Gauri is no longer in your life.

798
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:26,147
Still you've cherished her memories.

799
01:02:27,814 --> 01:02:29,216
Then why can't you handle my love.

800
01:02:29,816 --> 01:02:33,957
l've forgotten Gauri.
- No. Gauri has forgotten you.

801
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,127
Love is the story of 2 hearts.

802
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:41,830
Why to mourn for the person..

803
01:02:42,463 --> 01:02:45,134
..who doesn't have the
heart to understand love?

804
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:48,036
By taking Gauri's
fault on yourself..

805
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:49,437
..you only made her life better.

806
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:06,187
ln few days l saw many dreams.

807
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,790
Now to awaken me from my slumber..

808
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:11,125
..or to give me sleepless nights,
is in your hand.

809
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,796
Tomorrow morning l'll
wait for you here only.

810
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:03,201
l've written my love
on the banyan leaves.

811
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:11,844
l've written my love
on the banyan leaves.

812
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:17,081
The breeze has
brought my beloved along.

813
01:06:17,343 --> 01:06:22,386
Now l have only sleepless nights.

814
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:30,795
Now l have only sleepless nights.

815
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:36,133
Your henna hands
spread its fragrance.

816
01:06:36,863 --> 01:06:41,806
l've written my love
on the banyan leaves.

817
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:47,412
The breeze has
brought my beloved along.

818
01:07:30,316 --> 01:07:38,800
Your heartbeat keeps
a tab on my heartbeat.

819
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:47,442
With each passing day,
our love becomes deeper.

820
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:58,152
What does the romantic
weather says covertly?

821
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:06,126
With my breath let the
musk of your breath merge.

822
01:08:12,493 --> 01:08:17,769
This union since
ages and centuries.

823
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:23,041
Your henna hands
spread its fragrance.

824
01:08:23,504 --> 01:08:28,914
l've written my love
on the banyan leaves.

825
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:34,453
The breeze has
brought my beloved along.

826
01:09:40,113 --> 01:09:47,995
Without any string your
fickle beauty pulls me.

827
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:56,170
Let our lips lock
and write a story.

828
01:09:59,265 --> 01:10:07,280
l feel like closing my eyes
and sleeping in your arms.

829
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:10,212
Without seeing anything
or thinking anything..

830
01:10:10,544 --> 01:10:15,386
..l'll submerge in your dreams.

831
01:10:21,521 --> 01:10:26,531
Beloved, give me
without asking a gift.

832
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:32,202
The breeze has
brought my beloved along.

833
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:37,842
Now l have only sleepless nights.

834
01:10:38,004 --> 01:10:43,147
Your henna hands
spread its fragrance.

835
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:48,553
l've written my love
on the banyan leaves.

836
01:10:49,149 --> 01:10:54,359
The breeze has
brought my beloved along.

837
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,853
Daddy, this is the
Pajero car that l like.

838
01:11:25,151 --> 01:11:26,521
And l want to buy it.

839
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:27,855
Such an expensive
car in this village?

840
01:11:29,155 --> 01:11:30,223
Listen.
- Yes.

841
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,960
Whose car is this?
- Desh Raj Thakur, sir.

842
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:34,294
Thank you very much.
- Okay.

843
01:11:42,202 --> 01:11:44,139
Jagga.
- Give it to me, sir.

844
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:46,106
What were they saying?

845
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,178
They were praising the car.
They want to buy such a car.

846
01:11:49,242 --> 01:11:51,045
Oh, l see.

847
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,526
This car?

848
01:12:08,795 --> 01:12:11,800
We'd seen this car parked
outside the station, dad.

849
01:12:11,865 --> 01:12:13,100
Yes.
- Who got it here?

850
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:15,102
Watchman!

851
01:12:15,168 --> 01:12:17,272
One gentleman had come. He
Ieft the keys and letter.

852
01:12:19,906 --> 01:12:22,277
A gift on my behalf to
the village's son-in-law.

853
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:24,479
Desh Rai Thakur.
- Thakur!

854
01:12:25,278 --> 01:12:28,852
Dad, who is this Desh Rai Thakur?
- l don't know.

855
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:30,984
What a man!

856
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:32,821
l'm not foolish, Ariun.

857
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:34,822
That without any reason
l'll gift Bhanu Pratap's..

858
01:12:34,888 --> 01:12:37,325
..son-in-law a car worth 2 million.

859
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,093
This is my future thinking.

860
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:42,464
This is called removing the
fuse by giving the connection.

861
01:12:42,962 --> 01:12:45,835
Father, what are you trying
to say? l don't understand.

862
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:47,034
l'll explain.

863
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:49,837
Bhanu Pratap has got
his daughter married..

864
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:52,441
..to a billionaire lawyer's family.

865
01:12:52,506 --> 01:12:53,574
Really?
- Yes.

866
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:56,945
lf his daughter
gets married to you..

867
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,016
..then l could insult that
Bhanu Pratap whenever l want.

868
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:02,149
How?

869
01:13:02,215 --> 01:13:03,785
Look Ariun, when the
Iawyer's daughter will come to our..

870
01:13:03,850 --> 01:13:07,156
..house as my daughter-in-law,
then we'll harass her.

871
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:10,460
Then lawyer will do as we say.

872
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:14,798
And Bhanu Pratap will
do as the lawyer says.

873
01:13:14,928 --> 01:13:17,032
But father, will they agree?

874
01:13:17,297 --> 01:13:20,036
Thakur sir, l accept this alliance.

875
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:23,138
Even l make decisions
quickly like you. - Yes, yes.

876
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:26,909
Thakur sir, our
daughter wants to study l.A.S.

877
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,143
Fine. l don't mind.

878
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:31,512
We'll get them married.
She can study after marriage.

879
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:36,086
No, still.. we should
ask her opinion too.

880
01:13:36,316 --> 01:13:41,427
No need. Parents have the
responsibility of marriage.

881
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:43,090
Thakur sir, this alliance is fixed.

882
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:46,962
Whom? Whom did you ask?

883
01:13:47,026 --> 01:13:48,830
Radha!
- l don't accept this alliance.

884
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:52,201
l like Heera. l'll only marry him.

885
01:13:52,365 --> 01:13:55,939
What! You'll marry that illiterate!

886
01:13:56,235 --> 01:13:57,839
You marry the one whose father..

887
01:13:57,904 --> 01:13:59,440
..doesn't even
consider him as his son.

888
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:02,277
Yes, for me Heera
(diamond) is a diamond.

889
01:14:02,476 --> 01:14:04,813
You have a point, dear.
- You keep quiet!

890
01:14:05,512 --> 01:14:07,381
Listen to me carefully, Radha.

891
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:11,120
Your marriage will be held on
the 18th.. that too with Arjun.

892
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:12,420
This is my decision!

893
01:14:12,486 --> 01:14:18,129
Mother! l'll marry on the 18th!
But with Heera, not Arjun.

894
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:19,427
This is my decision!

895
01:14:25,165 --> 01:14:26,233
Wipe your sweat.

896
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,807
Heera! Heera!
- Yes.

897
01:14:31,938 --> 01:14:33,240
Radha has sent a letter for you.

898
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,142
Radha's letter? Give it to me.

899
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:39,314
Read it. And read it out for me too.

900
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:43,886
Only l am the literate one,
10th pass in this village.

901
01:14:44,518 --> 01:14:46,287
Take some advantage of
my being a literate.

902
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,224
Give it to me. Listen. Dear.

903
01:14:50,356 --> 01:14:52,126
Baburao, go away from here.

904
01:14:52,192 --> 01:14:54,162
Aren't you ashamed to listen
to other's love letter! Go away!

905
01:14:54,995 --> 01:14:56,063
Why are you telling him to leave?

906
01:14:56,396 --> 01:14:59,469
lf l make some mistake in reading..
then l'll be caught. Go!

907
01:15:00,434 --> 01:15:01,502
Read it, read it.

908
01:15:02,135 --> 01:15:03,203
'Dear, Mr. Heera# 

909
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:06,442
'My mother has fixed my
marriage against my wish# 

910

'l'm getting married
on the coming 18th# 

911
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:16,085
'Even after umpteenth attempts,
l couldn't stop this decision# 

912
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:20,422
'But if you want,

Mangalsutra on the 18th#

hang myself and commit a suicide#

'The decision is in your hand#

This is a big problem, Heera.
What will we do?

918
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:50,819
No, Mindra. l won't
Iet Radha die like this.

919
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:55,024
You do one thing.
Write a letter to Radha.

920
01:15:56,089 --> 01:15:58,092
Radha will marry only Heera.

921
01:15:58,324 --> 01:16:00,929
Sir! Sir! Your
father has called you.

922
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:10,840
Father has called me?
- Yes, sir.

923
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:15,779
You.. are you saying the truth?
- Yes, sir.

924
01:16:16,342 --> 01:16:21,351
What did he say? He
said to go and call Heera?

925
01:16:21,415 --> 01:16:22,483
Yes, sir.

926
01:16:28,154 --> 01:16:34,132
Father has called me. He has..
father has called.

927
01:16:39,299 --> 01:16:41,537
He has called me.

928
01:17:16,503 --> 01:17:17,771
Sharada..
- Yes, father.

929
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:25,381
Sharada, iust now our
daughter's in-laws had come.

930
01:17:26,379 --> 01:17:29,118
To give the invitation of
their daughter Radha's wedding.

931
01:17:32,118 --> 01:17:35,859
'l don't know how Heera and
Radha came close to each other# 

932
01:17:36,456 --> 01:17:39,195
'But l don't want
Radha to marry Heera# 

933

'Heera is your son#

'Even if l give my
consent as your relative..

..then what is the
guarantee that he'll marry# 

937
01:17:52,205 --> 01:17:54,208
'Before too he had loved a girl# 

938
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:57,345
'And he had ditched
her at the last moment#

'lf you want us to
keep our respect intact..

'l'll handle Radha# 

942
01:18:10,957 --> 01:18:12,760
For the first time l'd
to hear that someone..

943
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:16,500
..from our family is a cause
of hurdle for a girl's marriage.

944
01:18:18,965 --> 01:18:22,772
l've never asked for anything.
But today l'm helpless.

945
01:18:24,804 --> 01:18:27,410
Will he give me what l ask?
- Command, father.

946
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:32,113
Sharada, tell him to forget Radha.

947
01:18:34,347 --> 01:18:35,783
lf he does this, then
like Karan and Varun..

948
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:38,286
..l'll give him the status of a son.

949
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,293
Ask him. He wants Radha or father?

950
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:00,777
'Either Mangalsutra or death#

'Ask him. He wants Radha or father?'

953
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:12,887
l will wear the sacred
thread around my neck..

954
01:19:12,953 --> 01:19:14,923
..or the noose. - 'Ask him.
He wants Radha or father?'

955
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:16,056
l will wear the sacred
thread around my neck..

956
01:19:16,122 --> 01:19:17,458
..or the noose. - 'Ask him.
He wants Radha or father?'

957
01:19:20,994 --> 01:19:22,931
Come. Come. Greetings.
- Greetings.

958
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:28,303
You only want to hear
your father calling you son.

959
01:19:28,935 --> 01:19:30,838
You don't want to
hear Radha's voice.

960
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:33,775
Heera, love knocks a
fortunate one's door..

961
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,175
..only once in centuries.

962
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:38,079
Radha's love has called you.

963
01:19:38,377 --> 01:19:41,485
Don't turn deaf. Cross
the boundary of son's duty.

964
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:45,020
Anybody's anger is not
bigger than his age.

965
01:19:45,852 --> 01:19:48,991
Go. Go and marry Radha. Go, Heera.

966
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:09,178
Radha, you're still
not ready? Hurry up.

967
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:13,417
Everybody is waiting for you.
- Even l'm waiting for Heera.

968
01:20:14,247 --> 01:20:16,919
He won't come. And he can't come.

969
01:20:34,267 --> 01:20:35,335
Wear this!

970
01:20:37,237 --> 01:20:40,076
Look Radha, l won't bow
before your obstinacy.

971
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:43,847
l can't tolerate my humiliation.
Understood!

972
01:21:23,483 --> 01:21:25,119
Heera, what you're doing is wrong.

973
01:21:26,152 --> 01:21:27,287
The wedding procession is waiting.

974
01:21:27,353 --> 01:21:28,989
l won't tolerate this
humiliation quietly!

975
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:37,899
What are you looking at! Nab him!

976
01:22:10,396 --> 01:22:11,465
Heera!

977
01:22:40,427 --> 01:22:41,829
Apply the vermillion on
the bride's forehead..

978
01:22:41,895 --> 01:22:43,330
..put garland around her neck.

979
01:22:58,111 --> 01:23:01,785
Away from the rituals and customs..

980
01:23:01,848 --> 01:23:06,824
..considering God as the witness,
l accept you as my wife.

981
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:21,197
Father.. nobody apart from
you can change your decision.

982
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:25,435
Hitherto you'd
blessed married women.

983
01:24:26,967 --> 01:24:28,804
By killing my husband..
do you want to be..

984
01:24:28,868 --> 01:24:30,405
..the reason of my becoming a widow?

985
01:24:50,223 --> 01:24:53,430
Take this! Your share
of property and wealth!

986
01:24:54,027 --> 01:24:55,362
Pick this and get lost!

987
01:24:56,963 --> 01:24:59,100
You're a disgrace for me.

988
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,270
The bad part of this villa.

989
01:25:05,506 --> 01:25:09,012
And worst than that is this girl,
whom you've married.

990
01:25:09,342 --> 01:25:11,947
Get lost! There is no
place for you in this house!

991
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:15,785
lf anybody sees the
face of both of you..

992
01:25:15,849 --> 01:25:17,819
..then this Bhanu
Pratap won't see his face!

993
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:25,293
See him! Saw him!

994
01:25:26,893 --> 01:25:28,930
We didn't give him toys
to play in his childhood..

995
01:25:28,995 --> 01:25:30,531
..so now he's
playing with our emotions!

996
01:25:33,366 --> 01:25:35,804
Like Karan and Varun.. to have him..

997
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:39,041
..we prayed to God devoutly.

998
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:44,114
But God gave us the fruit of
that devotion half heartedly.

999
01:25:44,845 --> 01:25:46,815
He gave us this useless son!

1000
01:25:48,081 --> 01:25:51,187
Tell him to go away from here.
Henceforth he is not our son.

1001
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:52,319
Father.

1002
01:26:01,194 --> 01:26:02,764
When l'm not your son..

1003
01:26:02,829 --> 01:26:08,974
..then l don't have any
right on these property.

1004
01:26:11,337 --> 01:26:15,111
l don't want anything apart
from being called son by you.

1005
01:26:18,778 --> 01:26:21,951
l don't want this.

1006
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:28,223
l'm leaving considering your
rejection as your blessing.

1007
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:44,171
This is my Tai Mahal.

1008
01:26:44,938 --> 01:26:47,242
Till today, it was mine.
Now it is yours.

1009
01:27:05,525 --> 01:27:08,531
Those who took you away
from your own people..

1010
01:27:08,595 --> 01:27:10,565
..are you unhappy about
being separated from them?

1011
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,168
Forget what happened, Heera.

1012
01:27:15,702 --> 01:27:18,541
Start a life.. a new life!

1013
01:27:19,706 --> 01:27:21,543
Come on. Let's make
arrangements for your first night.

1014
01:27:21,608 --> 01:27:22,676
Come on. Come on.

1015
01:27:41,161 --> 01:27:44,635
Listen.. today is our wedding night.

1016
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:49,840
l want something from you.
You won't refuse, will you?

1017
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:54,578
l can't refuse. But
what can l give you?

1018
01:27:57,911 --> 01:28:02,252
My palm iust has
lines and nothing else.

1019
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:04,685
Tell me, what do you want?

1020
01:28:05,952 --> 01:28:07,522
Our families must be thinking that

1021
01:28:07,587 --> 01:28:09,858
..we will be unhappy all our lives.

1022
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:13,530
l wish that till our
sorrows don't turn to happiness..

1023
01:28:13,593 --> 01:28:17,969
..we shouldn't
celebrate out first night.

1024
01:28:18,965 --> 01:28:20,267
lt's all right.

1025
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:24,006
Look, even Meethu says,
it's all right.

1026
01:28:25,772 --> 01:28:27,007
lt's all right.

1027
01:28:31,745 --> 01:28:32,913
Are you upset?

1028
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,587
No. Why should l be? l liked it.

1029
01:28:41,555 --> 01:28:44,092
Where are you going?
- Out.

1030
01:28:44,591 --> 01:28:47,496
Why? If we can control ourselves..

1031
01:28:47,561 --> 01:28:49,831
..we can sleep in a room too.

1032
01:28:50,964 --> 01:28:52,099
All right, l'll sleep here.

1033
01:28:52,165 --> 01:28:53,902
Hey! Why are you
sleeping on the ground?

1034
01:28:55,836 --> 01:28:59,510
lf we can control ourselves,
we can sleep..

1035
01:28:59,573 --> 01:29:02,545
..together, on one bed too.

1036
01:29:11,117 --> 01:29:16,528
Staying under one roof,
sleeping on the same bed..

1037
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:21,733
..do you think we can..
- Control.

1038
01:29:21,795 --> 01:29:22,963
Yes. Control our selves?

1039
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:25,032
We'll try.

1040
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:28,936
Ok.

1041
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:43,752
l'll switch off the lights.
- Yes. Ok.

1042
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:52,161
What happened?
- Lizard! - Where?

1043
01:30:06,506 --> 01:30:10,781
Listen.. tonight ..

1044
01:30:11,612 --> 01:30:16,020
..if we don't
control ourselves, then..

1045
01:30:19,586 --> 01:30:25,731
l mean, if we
control from tomorrow..

1046
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:32,872
As you wish. By the way, there
are many lizards in this house.

1047
01:30:34,033 --> 01:30:36,906
Tomorrow, again in your sari..

1048
01:30:37,103 --> 01:30:38,271
..it's all right. it's all right.

1049
01:30:41,642 --> 01:30:42,910
Meethu is also saying..

1050
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:17,914
Come on.. Come one.

1051
01:31:17,978 --> 01:31:22,252
Come on.. Come one.

1052
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:38,265
Secretly.. secretly.

1053
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,972
Silently and secretly.

1054
01:31:44,571 --> 01:31:45,906
lt says.. it says.

1055
01:31:48,141 --> 01:31:50,513
My heart says..

1056
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:55,552
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1057
01:31:55,782 --> 01:31:59,221
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1058
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:04,228
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1059
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:10,067
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1060
01:32:10,764 --> 01:32:12,534
Secretly.. secretly.

1061
01:32:14,601 --> 01:32:17,673
Silently and secretly.

1062
01:32:18,171 --> 01:32:20,074
lt says.. it says.

1063
01:32:21,975 --> 01:32:25,247
My heart says.

1064
01:32:25,812 --> 01:32:29,251
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1065
01:32:29,616 --> 01:32:32,989
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1066
01:32:33,253 --> 01:32:38,530
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1067
01:32:38,892 --> 01:32:44,135
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1068
01:32:44,197 --> 01:32:47,904
Come on.. Come one.

1069
01:32:47,968 --> 01:32:52,577
Come on.. Come one.

1070
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:10,226
l am lost in many
questions like these.

1071
01:33:10,491 --> 01:33:13,229
l am lost in your thoughts.

1072
01:33:14,127 --> 01:33:16,499
Let us meet soon..

1073
01:33:16,563 --> 01:33:20,804
..l want to talk to you so much.

1074
01:33:21,735 --> 01:33:25,174
The starlight will be
sleeping in the stars.

1075
01:33:25,606 --> 01:33:28,712
There will be no
one except you and me.

1076
01:33:29,242 --> 01:33:35,788
Cold fire will burning..
the cold wind will be blowing.

1077
01:33:37,017 --> 01:33:40,624
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1078
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:44,093
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1079
01:33:44,558 --> 01:33:49,534
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1080
01:33:50,063 --> 01:33:55,206
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1081
01:34:16,857 --> 01:34:20,798
This world won't allow us to meet.

1082
01:34:20,861 --> 01:34:23,833
You will have to make an excuse.

1083
01:34:24,565 --> 01:34:28,104
Don't spread your open tresses..

1084
01:34:28,168 --> 01:34:31,508
..don't make me struggle any more.

1085
01:34:31,938 --> 01:34:35,712
Time doesn't stop for anyone.

1086
01:34:35,775 --> 01:34:38,948
These golden
opportunities may be lost.

1087
01:34:39,546 --> 01:34:43,085
The pains of
separation are very severe.

1088
01:34:43,149 --> 01:34:46,154
There are so many
guards over here.

1089
01:34:50,957 --> 01:34:52,727
Secretly.. secretly.

1090
01:34:54,728 --> 01:34:57,967
Silently and secretly.

1091
01:34:58,565 --> 01:34:59,900
lt says.. it says.

1092
01:35:02,135 --> 01:35:05,575
My heart says.

1093
01:35:05,939 --> 01:35:09,579
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1094
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:13,116
Hidden from the world's eyes.

1095
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:18,856
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1096
01:35:19,219 --> 01:35:24,597
Oh beloved, meet me
in secret sometimes.

1097
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:28,131
Come on.. Come on.

Silently and secretly.

1101
01:35:36,035 --> 01:35:37,506
Secretly.. secretly.

1102
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:39,507
Silently and secretly.

1103
01:35:39,773 --> 01:35:41,242
Secretly.. secretly.

1104
01:35:41,642 --> 01:35:43,177
Silently and secretly.

1105
01:35:43,543 --> 01:35:44,779
Secretly.. secretly.

1106
01:35:45,446 --> 01:35:47,483
Silently and secretly.

1107
01:35:52,886 --> 01:35:56,058
Radha.. Radha.. Radha..

1108
01:35:58,792 --> 01:35:59,860

ln a bus company.
- What work will you do?

1113
01:36:12,038 --> 01:36:13,508
Just like that of an owner.

1114
01:36:13,573 --> 01:36:16,479
Owner! - Yes. After the owner,
l am the next in line.

1115
01:36:16,543 --> 01:36:17,845
Really? Yes.

1116
01:36:18,211 --> 01:36:20,816
lt is a very clean iob.

1117
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:27,490
Those who are not useful,
we throw them out.

1118
01:36:28,922 --> 01:36:30,492
You throw them out!
- Yes.

1119
01:36:30,691 --> 01:36:33,930
ln short, all the
responsibility is on me.

1120
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,500
All responsibility?
- Yes.

1121
01:36:38,565 --> 01:36:39,733
lt must be very hard work.

1122
01:36:40,033 --> 01:36:42,638
No. It is not hard.
It is very easy. Yes!

1123
01:36:42,869 --> 01:36:44,539
The owner does it sitting.
l do it lying down.

1124
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:52,581
l am happy that you got a iob.

1125
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:56,252
Yes. And see this..
500 rupees as advance.

1126
01:36:57,551 --> 01:36:59,253
First they were
giving Me 1000 rupees. Oh!

01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,989
l said this wouldn't do.

l don't want 1 , but 500.
So they gave me 500 rupees.

1129
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:09,533
So you keep this 250. And

And don't make a
wrong connection too.

Then why is son-in-law feeding you?

Daddy, does Mother know

Child.. you know how
your Mother feels.

1194
01:40:35,235 --> 01:40:37,540
No Daddy. When you and
Mother give it together..

1195
01:40:37,604 --> 01:40:40,275
..only then we'll accept it.
- But child..

1196
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:42,143
No Daddy. Please.

1197
01:40:43,677 --> 01:40:46,014
All right. As you wish.

1198
01:40:47,146 --> 01:40:48,917
Ok Daddy.. tell me
what will you have?

1199
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:51,487
Food! A father
doesn't even drink water..

1200
01:40:51,552 --> 01:40:52,820
..at a daughter's house.

1201
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:55,490
Even after being such a
known lawyer of recent..

1202
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:57,493
..times, you are
propagating old ideas!

1203
01:40:57,558 --> 01:40:58,927
Tell me. What will you have?

1204
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,930
Whatever you give me, l'll eat it.

1205
01:41:01,995 --> 01:41:03,698
All right. You sit down.
l'll come back soon.

1206
01:41:04,230 --> 01:41:05,499
Sit down.

1207
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:09,938
Listen..
- Yes. l'll just come.

1208
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:11,739
l'm coming.

1209
01:41:11,805 --> 01:41:13,240
Please put water on my hands.
- Yes.

1210
01:41:14,541 --> 01:41:15,609
Put your hands ahead.

1211
01:41:20,514 --> 01:41:21,582
Enough.
- Towel.

1212
01:41:30,056 --> 01:41:31,158
What will l feed Daddy?

1213
01:41:32,191 --> 01:41:33,662
Prepare anything.

1214
01:41:35,729 --> 01:41:36,897
But there are no groceries at home.

1215
01:41:37,598 --> 01:41:38,666
What will you prepare?

1216
01:41:39,566 --> 01:41:42,872
Yes. Listen. Get
some milk and sugar.

1217
01:41:42,936 --> 01:41:44,004
Yes. l'll get it right away.

1218
01:41:56,016 --> 01:41:57,084
Mummy look..

1219
01:41:59,953 --> 01:42:01,021
What happened child?

1220
01:42:01,087 --> 01:42:03,659
l'll put sugar in it.
You sit outside.

1221
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:06,561
Sorry Daddy, l got late.

1222
01:42:06,627 --> 01:42:07,695
Come.
- Come.

1223
01:42:07,761 --> 01:42:10,666
Come! Sit down.

1224
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:13,834
Why are you staring at me, Daddy?

1225
01:42:15,234 --> 01:42:17,506
l see that the girl who never
used to step in the kitchen..

1226
01:42:17,571 --> 01:42:19,641
..how did she
become such a good cook!

1227
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:22,810
What have you prepared, child?

1228
01:42:23,076 --> 01:42:26,616
This is.. er..
- This is sweet rice.

1229
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:27,815
Yes. Sweet rice.

1230
01:42:27,881 --> 01:42:29,250
Sweet rice?
- Yes.

1231
01:42:30,183 --> 01:42:31,586
There was leftover
rice from yesterday.

1232
01:42:32,052 --> 01:42:35,626
l mixed milk and sugar
in it and made this.

1233
01:42:35,689 --> 01:42:38,528
Very good! My child
has become so smart!

1234
01:42:43,196 --> 01:42:44,866
Very good! It's very delicious.

1235
01:42:44,931 --> 01:42:45,999
Thank you Daddy.

1236
01:42:46,066 --> 01:42:48,471
Child, if there is some
more of this sweet rice..

1237
01:42:48,535 --> 01:42:51,139
..pack it for me. l'll
give it to your mother also.

1238
01:42:51,204 --> 01:42:52,640
l'll iust get it. Yes!

1239
01:42:55,141 --> 01:42:56,209
You're back..

1240
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:59,013
You are back after
meeting your runaway daughter..

1241
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:00,782
..and simpleton son-in-law.

1242
01:43:01,114 --> 01:43:04,488
Yes. l met them. And l've
seen that Heera is such a..

1243
01:43:04,551 --> 01:43:08,558
..diamond that is not
dependent on any jeweller's test.

1244
01:43:09,489 --> 01:43:11,527
He keeps our Radha
like an apple of his eye!

1245
01:43:11,592 --> 01:43:14,497
He has eloped with her.
So he will show off.

1246
01:43:14,561 --> 01:43:18,100
Even if it's pretence,
our Radha is very happy.

1247
01:43:18,164 --> 01:43:20,936
Enough, enough. Enough of
this praise. Now shut up.

1248
01:43:21,501 --> 01:43:23,939
l have been quiet since
l became your husband.

1249
01:43:25,071 --> 01:43:28,210
Oh yes! Here is sweet
rice cooked by Radha.

1250
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:32,616
l had it. It is very delicious.
Here, you have it too.

1251
01:43:32,679 --> 01:43:35,851
Take it away! It is not
meant for humans to eat.

1252
01:43:36,617 --> 01:43:39,723
All right. l'll have this too.

1253
01:43:40,554 --> 01:43:43,559
As it is, l'm fed up of having
tasteless food cooked by you.

1254
01:43:43,624 --> 01:43:44,692
What did you say?

1255
01:43:44,758 --> 01:43:47,497
Nothing.
- Enough now. Go upstairs now.

1256
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:51,034
Yes. - As it is you feel very
sleepy after eating sweet meats.

1257
01:43:51,097 --> 01:43:52,165
Shall l tell you something?

1258
01:43:53,734 --> 01:43:56,138
The man in that house
is a real husband and..

1259
01:43:56,202 --> 01:43:58,005
..the woman is a real wife.

1260
01:44:33,974 --> 01:44:35,042
Here.

1261
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:41,882
Drink it.

1262
01:44:45,519 --> 01:44:47,990
Did you like Meethi's
(sweet) Meethi (sweet) rice?

1263
01:44:48,555 --> 01:44:49,623
lt's good, isn't it?

1264
01:44:55,996 --> 01:44:59,202
Mona, why are you doing this?
Don't cry. Quiet now.

1265
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:04,007
How is my child? Is she happy?

1266
01:45:04,204 --> 01:45:06,642
She is very happy. Very happy.

1267
01:45:09,909 --> 01:45:11,012
What happened, Mohan?

1268
01:45:11,077 --> 01:45:12,814
Don't know. Some breakdown.

1269
01:45:12,879 --> 01:45:13,947
Oh no!

1270
01:45:14,014 --> 01:45:15,484
l'll find a mechanic.

1271
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:28,228
Hello.

1272
01:45:30,096 --> 01:45:32,501
You stay here.. in this village?

1273
01:45:33,567 --> 01:45:36,506
l thought that since you
have deserted your parents for..

1274
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:39,241
..Heera, you must be
living in a grand bungalow.

1275
01:45:40,106 --> 01:45:41,609
But your condition is..

1276
01:45:43,176 --> 01:45:45,681
After marriage, a
girl's surname changes.

1277
01:45:46,747 --> 01:45:48,650
But in your case, l think
that your fate has changed.

1278
01:45:50,884 --> 01:45:52,454
Now, you must even
have forgotten that..

1279
01:45:52,519 --> 01:45:53,587
..you wanted to be a collector.

1280
01:45:54,555 --> 01:45:57,460
That's good. When
poverty takes it's test..

1281
01:45:57,524 --> 01:46:01,865
..forget collectors, you
fail in even a clerk's training.

1282
01:46:03,597 --> 01:46:06,502
Now you understand,
why l didn't marry Heera?

1283
01:46:07,467 --> 01:46:09,471
Because l didn't want to waste..

1284
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,840
..my life in kitchen
and kids like you!

1285
01:46:15,475 --> 01:46:17,713
Just love is not enough to live.

1286
01:46:18,144 --> 01:46:21,116
Look at me. l rarely
keep my foot on the ground.

1287
01:46:22,115 --> 01:46:24,920
And you want to buy dreams!

1288
01:46:26,152 --> 01:46:27,855
But you don't even have a
fake coin in your hands.

1289
01:46:30,156 --> 01:46:31,959
You are an educated fool!

1290
01:46:42,035 --> 01:46:44,540
What happened? You
Iook very disturbed.

1291
01:46:47,874 --> 01:46:50,512
The one who threw
me out of her life..

1292
01:46:50,577 --> 01:46:52,881
..why doesn't she go
away from my world.

1293
01:46:53,713 --> 01:46:55,984
Why does she return to
prick thorns of taunts near me?

1294
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,152
Are you talking about Gauri?

1295
01:47:00,787 --> 01:47:03,626
Yes. l'm talking about Gauri.
Why does she laugh at you?

1296
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:08,031
Perhaps she feels happy by
doing it. Let her be happy.

1297
01:47:08,528 --> 01:47:09,631
l don't feel hurt.

1298
01:47:09,963 --> 01:47:14,872
But l do. l am
very hurt. l feel bad.

1299
01:47:19,973 --> 01:47:26,953
Look.. l.. l will
always be like l am.

1300
01:47:28,782 --> 01:47:31,888
lt's true that l'm a
branch of a very big tree.

1301
01:47:33,186 --> 01:47:34,923
But now, l've broken
away from the tree.

1302
01:47:37,924 --> 01:47:39,226
l don't have any future.

1303
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:45,000
But l wish that you
should fulfil your dream.

1304
01:47:45,064 --> 01:47:47,235
Now, none of my
dreams is mine alone.

1305
01:47:47,968 --> 01:47:51,775
Now everything starts
with you and ends with you.

1306
01:47:51,838 --> 01:47:55,144
Then for me, you start your
studies for being a collector.

1307
01:47:55,509 --> 01:47:56,577
Me!

1308
01:47:56,643 --> 01:47:58,613
l'll work hard day and night.

1309
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:02,720
l'll even sell myself
and collect money for you.

1310
01:48:04,017 --> 01:48:06,622
As high as you go,
l'll be that tall!

1311
01:48:21,067 --> 01:48:22,269
How come this army man is here?

1312
01:48:23,102 --> 01:48:24,706
He must have come to
collect his 10,OOO rupees.

1313
01:48:25,271 --> 01:48:26,741
lf he sees me here,
he won't spare me.

1314
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:28,208
l'll hide.

1315
01:48:32,746 --> 01:48:33,814
Who is it?

1316
01:48:34,715 --> 01:48:35,783
ls Dharmendra here?

1317
01:48:36,115 --> 01:48:37,552
He has gone to the
tailor to give his size..

1318
01:48:37,617 --> 01:48:40,155
..for knickers and vest.

1319
01:48:40,987 --> 01:48:41,988
Who are you?

1320
01:48:42,055 --> 01:48:46,163
l'm Dharmendra's
younger sister, Kammo.

1321
01:48:47,126 --> 01:48:48,195
Will you come out?

1322
01:48:49,062 --> 01:48:51,500
Out! No, not at all.
Brother Dharmendra has..

1323
01:48:51,565 --> 01:48:54,069
..forbidden me to come
out before strangers.

1324
01:48:54,501 --> 01:48:56,838
He says men have bad intentions.

1325
01:48:56,903 --> 01:48:59,240
They say something and
mean something else.

1326
01:48:59,506 --> 01:49:00,741
l won't come out.

1327
01:49:01,508 --> 01:49:05,014
Don't fear. l'll say what l mean.

1328
01:49:05,612 --> 01:49:07,949
l am a soldier. l
never lose control.

1329
01:49:08,014 --> 01:49:10,519
No, no. Looking at
pretty girls, even..

1330
01:49:10,584 --> 01:49:12,587
..decent men lose control.

1331
01:49:12,652 --> 01:49:13,755
Brother will return in the evening.

1332
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:15,790
You can talk to him then.

1333
01:49:15,855 --> 01:49:19,597
All right. l'll come
in the evening. Bye!

1334
01:49:19,659 --> 01:49:20,962
Bye! Bye!

1335
01:49:21,027 --> 01:49:24,567
l think l fooled him. l
won't be here in the evening.

1336
01:49:24,631 --> 01:49:26,200
l'll close the STD booth and go.

1337
01:49:26,266 --> 01:49:27,836
Excuse me..
- Who is it?

1338
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:31,541
My name is Champa. l
have heard that you..

1339
01:49:31,605 --> 01:49:36,280
..need a young and
beautiful operator.

1340
01:49:36,977 --> 01:49:39,081
Are you both, young and beautiful?

1341
01:49:39,713 --> 01:49:42,485
Coincidentally. The
young boys of Bharatpur see..

1342
01:49:42,549 --> 01:49:46,222
..me in their
dreams and do what all!

1343
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:50,159
l'm coming out. l'm coming..

1344
01:49:50,690 --> 01:49:52,895
Champa.. Champa.. where are you?

1345
01:49:53,226 --> 01:49:55,029
Here, before you.

1346
01:49:57,097 --> 01:50:01,506
Hey! Do you think that
l'm a fool, an idiot?

1347
01:50:01,768 --> 01:50:04,707
l'm a greater dramatist
then you! Give me the money.

1348
01:50:04,771 --> 01:50:06,741
l don't have it right now. It
was spent on the telephone booth.

1349
01:50:07,608 --> 01:50:10,179
Do something. Come back
on the 35th of this month.

1350
01:50:10,243 --> 01:50:12,514
Ok. If you don't give me
the money till the 35th..

1351
01:50:12,579 --> 01:50:15,250
..l'll destroy all this
and take away the phone.

1352
01:50:15,516 --> 01:50:16,584
Ok.
- Remember..

1353
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:18,687
Else no one will be worst than me!

1354
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:22,157
35th. Tell me..

1355
01:50:22,889 --> 01:50:24,692
ln this village, how many
days are there in a month?

1356
01:50:24,758 --> 01:50:27,530
Hey you!
- Why don't you answer my question?

1357
01:50:27,594 --> 01:50:28,662
Not you. The one before you..

1358
01:50:28,728 --> 01:50:31,668
Yes..
- Calling you..

1359
01:50:32,265 --> 01:50:35,070
Not you.
- 35.. - Wait a minute.

1360
01:50:35,135 --> 01:50:36,203
You.. you..

1361
01:50:36,269 --> 01:50:38,039
You..
- 35..

1362
01:50:40,273 --> 01:50:42,143
Yes, you uncle. How is aunt?

1363
01:50:42,909 --> 01:50:44,879
Tell her that l'll come
and meet her on 'Diwali'.

1364
01:50:45,111 --> 01:50:47,483
And if she needs money,
then send me a telegram.

1365
01:50:47,548 --> 01:50:49,150
Hey! My money..
- Just a minute. Just a minute.

1366
01:50:49,215 --> 01:50:51,118
l'll send a money order.

1367
01:50:51,918 --> 01:50:56,627
Give my love to aunt. Ok. Bye! Bye!

1368
01:51:00,861 --> 01:51:02,831
Tell me something.
Why was your uncle so..

1369
01:51:02,896 --> 01:51:04,933
..confused while talking to you?

1370
01:51:05,231 --> 01:51:08,003
Uncle..! What uncle? l
don't even know him.

1371
01:51:08,068 --> 01:51:09,738
l was iust teasing him.

1372
01:51:09,936 --> 01:51:13,510
These people get in to the bus
pushing and quarrelling and..

1373
01:51:13,574 --> 01:51:16,813
..catch the window seat. Then
they sleep away. Lazy bones!

1374
01:51:17,811 --> 01:51:20,516
Now all the way he will be
troubled, he will bang his..

1375
01:51:20,581 --> 01:51:22,518
..head on the window
thinking who am l..

1376
01:51:22,583 --> 01:51:26,189
..where did l meet him, how
am l related to him etc. etc.

1377
01:51:26,687 --> 01:51:29,191
Tell me something. What do
you get by doing such things?

1378
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,258
l have fun.

1379
01:51:31,592 --> 01:51:35,031
Fun! Then when will 35th come?
When will my money come?

1380
01:51:35,095 --> 01:51:36,163
She is here.

1381
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:38,533
l?
- No. Not you. Her.

1382
01:51:38,599 --> 01:51:39,667
He is calling you.

1383
01:51:39,733 --> 01:51:42,137
Not you sister, him.

1384
01:51:42,202 --> 01:51:44,974
He is calling you.
- No.. Yes. The one behind you.

1385
01:51:45,038 --> 01:51:47,676
Listen.. Iook there.

1386
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:49,611
Hey! How are you?

1387
01:51:49,676 --> 01:51:52,213
Big Brother! How are you?
How is sister-in-law?

1388
01:51:52,479 --> 01:51:55,083
ls she fine? Tell her to stock oil.

1389
01:51:55,482 --> 01:51:57,786
l'm coming to light
the lamps on Diwali.

1390
01:51:57,851 --> 01:51:59,119
Are you listening?

1391
01:51:59,753 --> 01:52:02,992
We'll watch Rangeela in day,
at night we'll celebrate Diwali.

1392
01:52:03,056 --> 01:52:07,130
We'll have one litre of liquor.
Ok? Bye! Cheerio!

1393
01:52:11,732 --> 01:52:12,800
Was he your brother?

1394
01:52:12,866 --> 01:52:14,936
What brother! He
doesn't have any work.

1395
01:52:15,001 --> 01:52:17,171
He fools people passing there.

1396
01:52:17,237 --> 01:52:18,640
Today l fooled him.

1397
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:22,010
Shall l tell you something?
Daily you fool people.

1398
01:52:22,075 --> 01:52:23,210
But today he has fooled you.

1399
01:52:23,677 --> 01:52:26,048
What rubbish! He was
my childhood friend.

1400
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:27,949
We used to study
together in school. Ok?

1401
01:52:28,014 --> 01:52:30,251
Childhood friend? He is as
old as your son might be.

1402
01:52:30,617 --> 01:52:32,520
He failed in one class many times.

1403
01:52:32,586 --> 01:52:33,754
So he didn't grow up. Understand?

1404
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:54,207
Give me that sack..

1405
01:52:58,578 --> 01:53:04,791
One.. Two.. Three.. Four..

1406
01:53:05,919 --> 01:53:07,722
You told me that
everything is in my hands!

1407
01:53:07,788 --> 01:53:10,225
The owner sits and works
and we lie down and work!

1408
01:53:10,657 --> 01:53:13,596
Do you do this work?
- 7.

1409
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:14,728
Enough.

1410
01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:17,899
Why did you lie to me?

1411
01:53:18,231 --> 01:53:21,504
Do you think that l will
make you toil in such a way..

1412
01:53:21,568 --> 01:53:24,139
..and become a collector?

1413
01:53:26,673 --> 01:53:28,108
Enough. Forget it.

1414
01:53:30,243 --> 01:53:34,250
Radha, you know
that l am uneducated.

1415
01:53:35,248 --> 01:53:36,985
What else could l
do except this work?

1416
01:53:37,917 --> 01:53:40,255
And then, toiling is
written in our destiny.

1417
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:43,058
lf a person tries, he
can change his destiny.

1418
01:53:43,690 --> 01:53:46,127
lf you want to do this work,
then buy an old bus.

1419
01:53:46,192 --> 01:53:47,461
You know how to drive it too.

1420
01:53:47,828 --> 01:53:48,963
But where is the money?

1421
01:53:49,563 --> 01:53:51,466
One who doesn't have
money to buy a bus ticket..

1422
01:53:51,532 --> 01:53:52,967
..how can he buy the entire bus?

1423
01:53:53,033 --> 01:53:54,836
Take the money from me.
- No, no.

1424
01:53:54,901 --> 01:53:58,073
Take it as a loan. When
you get enough, return it.

1425
01:53:58,572 --> 01:53:59,640
And if l don't get..

1426
01:54:00,139 --> 01:54:01,476
From childhood l've been
burdened so much with pain..

1427
01:54:01,542 --> 01:54:04,113
..that l don't have the
courage to bear any more burden.

1428
01:54:04,478 --> 01:54:05,546
Look Heera..

1429
01:54:05,979 --> 01:54:07,749
l'm giving you a helping
hand considering you as my own.

1430
01:54:08,482 --> 01:54:11,153
lf you think that l'm your
own then shake hands with me.

1431
01:54:14,621 --> 01:54:17,225
All right then. l
don't need to be here now.

1432
01:54:17,991 --> 01:54:20,529
lf you think l'm an
outsider then l'll go.

1433
01:54:20,594 --> 01:54:21,862
Hey uncle! Stop.

1434
01:54:23,764 --> 01:54:26,068
Uncle is right. He
is not an outsider.

1435
01:54:26,666 --> 01:54:28,504
Borrow money from him and buy a bus.

1436
01:54:28,735 --> 01:54:31,005
We'll return it with interest.
- But Radha..

1437
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:33,175
No ifs and buts!
Come, let's buy a bus.

1438
01:55:02,736 --> 01:55:04,973
Brothers and.. brothers.

1439
01:55:05,906 --> 01:55:08,978
Till now you have travelled
in buses of Kevada Thakur.

1440
01:55:09,743 --> 01:55:11,646
This bus is neither
deluxe nor luxury.

1441
01:55:12,045 --> 01:55:15,519
But still you will enioy the
ride like an air-conditioned bus.

1442
01:55:15,582 --> 01:55:16,784
Ask me how?

1443
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:19,488
No one is asking.. Ask!
- How?!

1444
01:55:19,553 --> 01:55:22,492
Because the conductor we
have kept in this bus is..

1445
01:55:22,556 --> 01:55:25,495
..not a he, but a she.
She is a sparkler.

1446
01:55:25,559 --> 01:55:29,900
The sparkler's name is Karishma.

1447
01:55:38,872 --> 01:55:40,241
Haven't your heartbeats stopped!

1448
01:55:40,707 --> 01:55:41,942
Karishma, book the tickets.

1449
01:55:47,648 --> 01:55:48,983
Tell me. Which ticket shall l book?

1450
01:55:49,182 --> 01:55:50,885
What all places can you book me for?

1451
01:55:52,453 --> 01:55:55,959
ldiot! She doesn't cut hair.
She books tickets.

1452
01:55:56,022 --> 01:55:57,759
Ticket! Yes.

1453
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,193
Alibaug.

1454
01:56:00,694 --> 01:56:02,764
Alibaug ticket is iust for 2 rupees.

1455
01:56:05,064 --> 01:56:07,102
What will you do at Alibaug?

1456
01:56:07,167 --> 01:56:09,004
My house is at Alibaug.

1457
01:56:09,068 --> 01:56:10,472
And like everyday,
he will go home and..

1458
01:56:10,537 --> 01:56:11,605
..get bashed by his wife!

1459
01:56:12,839 --> 01:56:15,477
lt's better to enioy
the ride with Karishma.

1460
01:56:15,542 --> 01:56:17,144
Go to Jhumri Talaiyya.
In return from there..

1461
01:56:17,210 --> 01:56:18,613
..get down at Alibaug.
2 rupees for Alibaug..

1462
01:56:18,679 --> 01:56:20,148
..and 20 rupees for Jhumri Talaiyya.

1463
01:56:20,847 --> 01:56:22,884
ls it? Ok, here is Rs.20.

1464
01:56:26,019 --> 01:56:27,589
Where will you go?

1465
01:56:27,988 --> 01:56:31,962
Alibaug. But l'll get down in
return from Jhumri Talaiyya.

1466
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:44,972
Get in. Get in.

1467
01:56:49,108 --> 01:56:51,012
Give me one ticket
to Jhumri Talaiyya.

1468
01:56:51,077 --> 01:56:53,047
lt will be 30 rupees.
- 30 rupees! Yes.

1469
01:56:53,112 --> 01:56:55,183
Why 30 rupees? Other
buses charge only 20 rupees.

1470
01:56:55,248 --> 01:56:56,517
And you charge 30 rupees!

1471
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,687
Hey! Other buses are iust deluxe.

1472
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,956
Our bus is super-deluxe. Look there.

1473
01:57:05,792 --> 01:57:07,194
So, how is the Super-Deluxe?

1474
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:08,830
lt is very nice, sir. Very nice.

1475
01:57:08,895 --> 01:57:09,963
All right then, give 30 rupees.

1476
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:12,802
Why iust 30? l can
even Pay rupees 50! Here.

1477
01:57:12,866 --> 01:57:14,201
Take this ticket. And come tomorrow.

1478
01:57:14,267 --> 01:57:16,104
Tomorrow?
- Then what? Now!?

1479
01:57:16,169 --> 01:57:18,172
They are standing in the
queue since last night.

1480
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:19,541
They got a ticket
right now and hence..

1481
01:57:19,606 --> 01:57:20,674
..they are getting in the bus.

1482
01:57:20,741 --> 01:57:21,909
Look there. They are
standing in the queue for..

1483
01:57:21,975 --> 01:57:23,110
..tomorrow's advance
booking now itself.

1484
01:57:23,176 --> 01:57:24,278
But how can that be?

1485
01:57:24,545 --> 01:57:25,613
lf it can't then take your
money back. Return the ticket.

1486
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,214
No, no. l'll come tomorrow.
- Ok. Go now.

1487
01:57:28,048 --> 01:57:30,218
Hey conductor! Book
a ticket for me too.

1488
01:57:30,283 --> 01:57:33,022
Where are you going? The
ticket counter is over here.

1489
01:57:33,086 --> 01:57:37,093
Oh! Is it here? l
can't see. l'm blind

1490
01:57:37,558 --> 01:57:39,093
Then why do you want
to get in the bus?

1491
01:57:39,158 --> 01:57:40,562
People like you
don't go in the bus..

1492
01:57:40,627 --> 01:57:42,831
..the bus goes over you.
Go and lie under it.

1493
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:47,671
What if l can't see? l can
enjoy just by touching too!

1494
01:57:48,702 --> 01:57:50,906
Where is the lady conductor?
Where is she?

1495
01:57:52,939 --> 01:57:55,109
Not there. Not there.
Wrong number. Wrong number.

1496
01:57:57,243 --> 01:57:58,846
Who told you to employ
a girl as a conductor?

1497
01:57:59,112 --> 01:58:00,615
That way, passengers
would have increased.

1498
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,749
lf no one was getting in the bus..

1499
01:58:01,815 --> 01:58:02,883
..you should have let it stand here!

1500
01:58:04,518 --> 01:58:05,786
l have named this bus
company after my father.

1501
01:58:06,653 --> 01:58:08,188
l can ruin myself but not his name.

1502
01:58:08,722 --> 01:58:10,926
Take this money and return it.

1503
01:58:10,991 --> 01:58:13,930
Now l'll drive the bus. And l
very well know how to drive it.

1504
01:58:42,523 --> 01:58:48,033
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1505
01:58:48,094 --> 01:58:53,738
Slowly you coloured
them and fulfilled them.

1506
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:05,518
l promise l'll always
Iove you more than my life..

1507
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:10,254
..l promise.

1508
01:59:10,651 --> 01:59:16,161
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1509
01:59:16,222 --> 01:59:22,200
Slowly you coloured
them and fulfilled them.

1510
01:59:27,967 --> 01:59:34,548
l promise l'll always
Iove you more than my life..

1511
01:59:34,608 --> 01:59:38,716
..l promise.

1512
01:59:38,778 --> 01:59:44,222
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1513
02:00:29,195 --> 02:00:34,539
We'll get stars in our home..

1514
02:00:34,601 --> 02:00:40,612
..and burn lamps of hope.

1515
02:00:40,674 --> 02:00:51,127
Blossoms have come.. they
have brought happiness.

1516
02:00:51,785 --> 02:00:57,496
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1517
02:00:57,557 --> 02:01:03,068
Slowly you coloured
them and fulfilled them.

1518
02:01:14,841 --> 02:01:21,521
l promise l'll always
Iove you more than my life..

1519
02:01:21,581 --> 02:01:25,589
..l promise.

1520
02:01:25,652 --> 02:01:31,262
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1521
02:02:04,825 --> 02:02:16,013
Birds never cry..
stones never shed tears.

1522
02:02:16,069 --> 02:02:21,145
You get some one and lose someone.

1523
02:02:21,775 --> 02:02:27,051
Whatever has to
happen always happens.

1524
02:02:27,113 --> 02:02:33,091
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1525
02:02:33,152 --> 02:02:39,131
Slowly you coloured
them and fulfilled them.

1526
02:02:44,698 --> 02:02:50,476
l promise l'll always
Iove you more than my life..

1527
02:02:50,537 --> 02:02:55,212
..l promise.

1528
02:02:55,542 --> 02:03:01,085
My hollow dreams were
incomplete since so many years.

1529
02:03:01,147 --> 02:03:06,791
Slowly you coloured
them and fulfilled them.

1530
02:03:31,244 --> 02:03:33,014
Why isn't water being
released in the fields?

1531
02:03:33,179 --> 02:03:35,617
Thakur-sir, we are fed
up of giving applications.

1532
02:03:36,149 --> 02:03:38,821
No hearing is being given for
water in the Collector's office.

1533
02:03:39,185 --> 02:03:41,690
And now, there will be
no hearing too. - Reason?

1534
02:03:41,755 --> 02:03:43,492
You know the reason Thakur-sir.

1535
02:03:43,557 --> 02:03:45,594
Your younger daughter-in-law
is the collector right now.

1536
02:04:00,707 --> 02:04:01,775
Greetings, Thakur.

1537
02:04:03,844 --> 02:04:04,912
Greetings, Thakur.

1538
02:04:05,579 --> 02:04:08,551
Listen, brother. We
have come from Bharatpur.

1539
02:04:09,583 --> 02:04:11,486
We have to make a
petition to the collector.

1540
02:04:11,652 --> 02:04:14,624
The collector is busy inside.
Give me your name.

1541
02:04:14,688 --> 02:04:15,756
l'll have it delivered inside.

1542
02:04:18,792 --> 02:04:22,799
Here is our card. - Sit there.
As you are called l'll bring you in.

1543
02:04:23,129 --> 02:04:25,834
Sorry sir. The complaints of
the public that we receive..

1544
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:29,238
..they are not right
for the law and order.

1545
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:31,540
So please try and stop such things.

1546
02:04:31,938 --> 02:04:35,578
Madam, until we have
political pressure, we..

1547
02:04:35,642 --> 02:04:39,248
Madam, some people from
Bharatpur have come to meet you.

1548
02:04:39,513 --> 02:04:40,915
Tell them to wait.

1549
02:04:41,247 --> 02:04:44,721
Sir, you do your duty. l
will look after everything else.

1550
02:04:48,955 --> 02:04:50,591
Shyamlal!
- Yes Madam?

1551
02:04:50,657 --> 02:04:54,631
Those people from Bharatpur are
respectful. Get them in. - Ok.

1552
02:04:55,629 --> 02:04:58,468
Excuse me, sir. Please
excuse me for 10 minutes.

1553
02:04:58,532 --> 02:04:59,600
Sure, madam.
- Thank you.

1554
02:05:01,468 --> 02:05:03,605
Sir, madam is calling you.

1555
02:05:17,484 --> 02:05:21,692
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1556
02:05:21,755 --> 02:05:22,823
Sit down.

1557
02:05:34,568 --> 02:05:36,103
And this girl is much more worse..

1558
02:05:36,169 --> 02:05:37,805
..who has held your hand!

1559
02:05:37,871 --> 02:05:41,010
Get lost from here! There is
no place for you in this house.

1560
02:05:42,042 --> 02:05:47,085
lf anyone even sees your faces,
l'll not see his face!

1561
02:05:48,782 --> 02:05:51,454
Your application is that
the water of dam Ganga..

1562
02:05:51,518 --> 02:05:54,055
..must be released in your district.

1563
02:05:54,654 --> 02:05:55,723
You please sit down.

1564
02:05:56,457 --> 02:05:59,128
The dam authorities
have been ordered to..

1565
02:05:59,192 --> 02:06:01,129
..release water in your district.

1566
02:06:17,711 --> 02:06:20,215
You will start getting water
from the month of December.

1567
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:25,923
Madam, we need water
from October itself.

1568
02:06:27,621 --> 02:06:29,090
Due to a famine last year..

1569
02:06:29,155 --> 02:06:31,225
..the moisture in the
fields has been lost.

1570
02:06:32,826 --> 02:06:34,696
The seeds can't be planted
without sprinkling water.

1571
02:06:34,761 --> 02:06:38,502
But iust for your district,
how can we..

1572
02:06:38,565 --> 02:06:40,502
..release water 2 months early?

1573
02:06:40,567 --> 02:06:43,138
lf you see it as a district,
it is just one.

1574
02:06:44,170 --> 02:06:46,107
But there are 85
villages in it and have..

1575
02:06:46,172 --> 02:06:48,242
..a total population of 125,OOO.

1576
02:06:49,242 --> 02:06:50,645
That's why don't see
it as one district.

1577
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:53,248
Look at the 125,OOO
people living there.

1578
02:06:53,514 --> 02:06:56,853
l agree with you. But.. Excuse me.

1579
02:06:58,718 --> 02:07:01,190
Hello Radha.. l'm
Payal Malhotra speaking.

1580
02:07:01,721 --> 02:07:03,024
Hi Payal. How are you?

1581
02:07:03,089 --> 02:07:05,661
l'm fine.
- How did you remember me?

1582
02:07:06,092 --> 02:07:08,530
On the occasion of
completing 4 years with my husband..

1583
02:07:08,595 --> 02:07:11,066
..l'm throwing small
party on the 15th.

1584
02:07:11,131 --> 02:07:13,268
l'm sorry Payal. l can't come.

1585
02:07:13,933 --> 02:07:16,071
lt is my
Father-in-law's birthday on 15th.

1586
02:07:17,704 --> 02:07:20,609
My husband and l offer
prayers in the temple that day.

1587
02:07:21,007 --> 02:07:22,643
Anyway. How is your son?

1588
02:07:22,709 --> 02:07:25,548
Great. He has gone
on his Grandfather..

1589
02:07:25,612 --> 02:07:28,116
..looks wise,
intellectually and traits.

1590
02:07:30,651 --> 02:07:32,554
Be careful. See that he
doesn't start calling your..

1591
02:07:32,619 --> 02:07:34,856
..husband, son, iust
like your Father-in-law!

1592
02:07:35,556 --> 02:07:36,624
Bye!

1593
02:07:37,891 --> 02:07:40,563
l'm sorry. l'll talk to the
Irrigation department and..

1594
02:07:40,627 --> 02:07:43,933
..Divisional officer
regarding your application.

1595
02:07:44,230 --> 02:07:46,902
l'll try that your
district gets water soon.

1596
02:07:47,868 --> 02:07:48,936
Thank you.

1597
02:07:57,678 --> 02:07:59,515
Master, before coming here,
there was an ill reputation..

1598
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:00,949
..about younger daughter-in-law.

1599
02:08:01,014 --> 02:08:02,751
But she seemed to be very cultured.

1600
02:08:03,149 --> 02:08:04,519
Sitting on the chair, she
fulfilled her Collector's duty..

1601
02:08:04,585 --> 02:08:06,588
..and by touching your feet,
a daughter-in-law's duty.

1602
02:08:06,653 --> 02:08:08,022
She fulfilled it together.

1603
02:08:19,533 --> 02:08:22,538
You fools, we aren't even
recovering the diesel money..

1604
02:08:22,603 --> 02:08:24,540
..from these buses! Tell
me how will l run them?

1605
02:08:24,605 --> 02:08:25,673
But what can we do sir?

1606
02:08:25,739 --> 02:08:28,544
Thakur Heera has wooed
all the customers by..

1607
02:08:28,609 --> 02:08:30,546
..announcing different gift schemes.

1608
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:32,548
That's why no one
gets in our buses, sir.

1609
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:35,550
Here Heera did this and there
Bhanu Pratap accused you of..

1610
02:08:35,616 --> 02:08:37,553
..dishonouring Kamali
and got you imprisoned..

1611
02:08:37,618 --> 02:08:39,287
..through the Village Committee.

1612
02:08:40,554 --> 02:08:43,693
ln the villagers eyes, our
reputation has been ruined, dad.

1613
02:08:44,891 --> 02:08:46,828
And the cherry on the
pudding is that Bhanu Pratap's..

1614
02:08:46,893 --> 02:08:49,063
..daughter-in-law has
become the Collector.

1615
02:08:49,796 --> 02:08:51,499
He has taken advantage of
that and got an approval..

1616
02:08:51,565 --> 02:08:53,969
..for releasing water to the fields.

1617
02:08:54,935 --> 02:08:57,005
Due to this the villagers
and farmers have more respect..

1618
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:58,840
..for Suryavansh now!

1619
02:08:58,905 --> 02:09:03,179
Enough! Now the reputation
of Suryavansh will not grow..

1620
02:09:03,243 --> 02:09:06,182
..and neither will his lineage.

1621
02:09:29,068 --> 02:09:30,137
Radha, l'm going to office.

1622
02:09:30,203 --> 02:09:32,575
Listen.. Gauri is here
to ask for your help.

1623
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:34,908
From me!

1624
02:09:35,976 --> 02:09:38,080
My husband has had a
huge loss in his business.

1625
02:09:40,747 --> 02:09:41,815
His business has been closed.

1626
02:09:43,484 --> 02:09:44,786
He is unemployed from 6 months.

1627
02:09:47,521 --> 02:09:50,493
There is an ad in the
newspaper that your sugar..

1628
02:09:50,557 --> 02:09:52,794
..factory needs a
production manager.

1629
02:09:54,495 --> 02:10:00,506
lf you give that post to my
husband, l'll be very grateful.

1630
02:10:04,505 --> 02:10:07,510
Look, if your husband and his
royalty is not affected by..

1631
02:10:07,574 --> 02:10:09,577
..working in my
factory then l don't mind.

1632
02:10:11,177 --> 02:10:12,613
Tell him to come and meet me.

1633
02:10:13,613 --> 02:10:14,682
Radha, l'll leave now.

1634
02:10:17,083 --> 02:10:18,151
Sit down, Gauri.

1635
02:10:23,824 --> 02:10:25,092
Did you see the fate?

1636
02:10:25,826 --> 02:10:28,531
The one whom you had
rejected as an uneducated..

1637
02:10:28,595 --> 02:10:31,534
..simpleton, you had to
come to him for a job..

1638
02:10:31,598 --> 02:10:33,868
..for your educated husband.

1639
02:10:35,836 --> 02:10:38,608
l'm not taunting you.
l'm trying to explain.

1640
02:10:39,005 --> 02:10:42,479
This is the same Heera for
whom you said that there is..

1641
02:10:42,543 --> 02:10:45,482
..nothing special about him to
introduce, while introducing..

1642
02:10:45,546 --> 02:10:47,716
..him to your friends. But today..

1643
02:10:47,781 --> 02:10:49,951
Big VIP's struggle to meet him.

1644
02:10:52,151 --> 02:10:55,492
People say that
every successful man..

1645
02:10:55,556 --> 02:10:58,495
..has a woman behind him.
But l'm the first woman..

1646
02:10:58,559 --> 02:11:02,098
..who is successful
due to her husband.

1647
02:11:02,496 --> 02:11:03,965
He himself became successful..

1648
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,098
..but he also made me successful.

1649
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:10,774
Now tell me.. who is an
educated idiot.. you or me?

1650
02:11:13,073 --> 02:11:14,141
Have tea.

1651
02:11:16,175 --> 02:11:17,846
Don't feel bad about what l said.

1652
02:11:19,045 --> 02:11:20,982
l have no vice in my heart for you.

1653
02:11:22,716 --> 02:11:26,523
You see, God gives heart
to everyone, he gives a..

1654
02:11:26,587 --> 02:11:30,528
..beloved to everyone too. But
he gives a Heera (diamond)..

1655
02:11:30,591 --> 02:11:32,561
..only to someone special.

1656
02:11:41,101 --> 02:11:44,475
This year l'll apply to
the government to grant..

1657
02:11:44,538 --> 02:11:47,510
..permission for higher
secondary to the school.

1658
02:11:51,912 --> 02:11:55,051
Oh! Forgive me. l
didn't See you coming.

1659
02:11:55,782 --> 02:11:57,585
lt happened unknowingly. Sorry.

1660
02:11:57,651 --> 02:12:00,990
No one will do it purposely.
It's all right.

1661
02:12:05,659 --> 02:12:08,230
His values are greater than his age.

1662
02:12:08,762 --> 02:12:10,699
Why won't they be, sir!

1663
02:12:11,230 --> 02:12:12,834
After all he is Suryavansh blood.

1664
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:16,839
Yes master. He is Mr. Heera's son.

1665
02:12:37,891 --> 02:12:39,961
Are you back again to say sorry?

1666
02:12:40,694 --> 02:12:42,497
l have already forgiven you.

1667
02:12:44,465 --> 02:12:45,567
What is your name, son?

1668
02:12:45,632 --> 02:12:47,702
Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh.

1669
02:12:50,203 --> 02:12:53,042
Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh?

1670
02:12:53,106 --> 02:12:55,678
Don't say this name aloud!

1671
02:12:56,209 --> 02:12:59,014
Why?
- This is my Grandpa's name.

1672
02:12:59,078 --> 02:13:01,082
No one says his name.

1673
02:13:01,715 --> 02:13:04,954
l see. Have you ever met him?

1674
02:13:05,018 --> 02:13:07,890
No. l have not even seen him.

1675
02:13:08,989 --> 02:13:10,992
Hey! Elephant..! Elephant..!

1676
02:13:11,057 --> 02:13:12,660
Elephant..! Elephant..!

1677
02:13:14,227 --> 02:13:15,897
Will you ride it?
- Yes.

1678
02:13:15,962 --> 02:13:18,032
Come, l'll take you for a ride.

1679
02:13:18,665 --> 02:13:22,171
Hey Elephant rider! Please
take the boy for a ride.

1680
02:13:23,003 --> 02:13:24,171
Go son.
- Come on son.

1681
02:13:24,237 --> 02:13:26,040
Give this bag to me. Yes. Carefully.

1682
02:13:26,105 --> 02:13:28,009
Look that he doesn't fall.
- Yes sir.

1683
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:32,179
Come on.

1684
02:13:37,684 --> 02:13:42,460
Bye! Bye! Come on my elephant.

1685
02:13:42,523 --> 02:13:44,960
Come on.. every one follow me.

1686
02:13:49,095 --> 02:13:50,565
Come on my elephant.

1687
02:13:50,630 --> 02:13:52,835
Look, where l am sitting.

1688
02:13:55,001 --> 02:13:56,537
Bye! Bye!

1689
02:13:56,603 --> 02:13:58,707
Enough! Enough Stop now.

1690
02:14:04,143 --> 02:14:05,212
Take this.

1691
02:14:05,979 --> 02:14:08,216
So, how was the elephant ride?

1692
02:14:08,782 --> 02:14:11,954
Very nice. Tell me something.
- Ask me.

1693
02:14:12,018 --> 02:14:16,727
l don't even know you. Then
why did you do this for me?

1694
02:14:17,724 --> 02:14:18,792
Why did l do it!

1695
02:14:19,926 --> 02:14:23,500
Yes. l know. Because
you spilled ink on..

1696
02:14:23,564 --> 02:14:26,068
..my shirt, that's why. Isn't it?

1697
02:14:26,132 --> 02:14:28,637
Right. Right.

1698
02:14:28,702 --> 02:14:29,837
Who are you?

1699
02:14:30,136 --> 02:14:34,512
Me? Consider me your friend,

1700
02:14:34,775 --> 02:14:35,843
Friend?

1701
02:14:35,909 --> 02:14:38,514
Yes. Am l not
capable to be your friend?

1702
02:14:38,812 --> 02:14:41,784
Your friendship is better
than even the elephant ride.

1703
02:14:42,816 --> 02:14:45,454
Ok friend. My bus is here. Bye!

1704
02:14:45,519 --> 02:14:47,489
Hey Listen.. take your bag..

1705
02:14:47,554 --> 02:14:50,459
Ok. Bye. See you again.

1706
02:15:15,915 --> 02:15:19,490
Very good. You have
had sweets. Come on!

1707
02:15:20,487 --> 02:15:26,064
Another. Come on. Just one more.
- Enough. l wont eat now.

1708
02:15:27,494 --> 02:15:28,562
Open your mouth. Open.

1709
02:15:31,832 --> 02:15:32,900
What is this?

1710
02:15:32,966 --> 02:15:36,673
Your tooth has been taken by a rat.
- How could he?

1711
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:40,677
Friend, children lose their teeth.

1712
02:15:40,740 --> 02:15:44,047
Then they get new teeth. Oh!

1713
02:15:47,814 --> 02:15:50,185
Friend, won't the
elephant come today?

1714
02:15:50,950 --> 02:15:53,088
Why? Do you want to ride him?

1715
02:15:53,620 --> 02:15:57,561
Yes. - Come on. Today
l'll be the elephant.

1716
02:15:57,624 --> 02:16:01,765
Come.
- Come on, elephant.

1717
02:16:04,665 --> 02:16:06,468
Move, elephant!

1718
02:16:06,533 --> 02:16:08,536
Come on, elephant.

1719
02:16:08,835 --> 02:16:09,903
Look at sir.

1720
02:16:09,969 --> 02:16:17,217
- Come on. Come on move faster!
Run! Move elephant! -

1721
02:16:17,644 --> 02:16:18,779
Come on, elephant.

1722
02:16:18,845 --> 02:16:21,049
Wait now. Get off.

1723
02:16:22,949 --> 02:16:25,921
Did you have fun?
- Yes. More than the elephant.

1724
02:16:25,985 --> 02:16:27,723
Ok, come.

1725
02:16:28,855 --> 02:16:34,131
Tell me, friend. Who else
do you have in your family?

1726
02:16:34,561 --> 02:16:36,698
Mummy, daddy and me.

1727
02:16:38,665 --> 02:16:42,238
ls that all? No one else?
- No.

1728
02:16:47,907 --> 02:16:53,519
Listen. l also have grandparents,
2 uncles and aunts.

1729
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,517
But l don't know where do they live.

1730
02:16:57,183 --> 02:17:02,192
Who told you all this?
- My father told me.

1731
02:17:03,690 --> 02:17:04,825
What else did he tell you?

1732
02:17:04,891 --> 02:17:09,834
Grandfather didn't like my daddy.
So, he threw him out of the house.

1733
02:17:11,064 --> 02:17:14,036
Didn't he reveal why he didn't
like him? - He didn't study enough.

1734
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,903
Grandfather is not
to blame for this.

1735
02:17:16,136 --> 02:17:20,010
lf l don't study,
daddy will be angry. Right?

1736
02:17:22,909 --> 02:17:26,048
Ok. Its time for me to go home. Bye.

1737
02:17:26,546 --> 02:17:30,086
Listen, take this home.

1738
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:31,853
Thank you, friend.
l'll meet you tomorrow.

1739
02:17:35,221 --> 02:17:37,191
Listen, l've sent
the cards to everybody.

1740
02:17:37,758 --> 02:17:39,895
But father has still
not received the card.

1741
02:17:40,627 --> 02:17:42,129
He is going to do the inauguration.

1742
02:17:44,665 --> 02:17:49,541
Yes, Radha. He'll never see my face.

1743
02:17:51,505 --> 02:17:53,775
lt will be good if you
go and give him the card.

1744
02:17:54,875 --> 02:17:58,248
lf he comes, then l'll
think that he's not angry.

1745
02:17:59,245 --> 02:18:00,815
lf not then..
- Daddy.

1746
02:18:01,515 --> 02:18:02,583
Hey!

1747
02:18:03,684 --> 02:18:06,021
Take this. l've got sweets for you.

1748
02:18:07,654 --> 02:18:08,822
Who gave you this?

1749
02:18:09,255 --> 02:18:14,264
My friend. He was
saying that you love sweets.

1750
02:18:14,628 --> 02:18:15,696
Really?
- Yes.

1751
02:18:15,762 --> 02:18:17,030
Your friend?
- Yes.

1752
02:18:17,096 --> 02:18:18,934
l don't know any of your friends.

1753
02:18:19,700 --> 02:18:21,202
Then how did he come to
know about what l like.

1754
02:18:21,702 --> 02:18:22,770
He studies in your class?

1755
02:18:22,836 --> 02:18:24,873
No, he has already
completed his studies.

1756
02:18:25,171 --> 02:18:27,676
He has big beard and moustache.

1757
02:18:30,544 --> 02:18:31,612
Beard and moustache?

1758
02:18:31,678 --> 02:18:34,750
Yes. l befriended
him a few days back.

1759
02:18:36,282 --> 02:18:37,551
How does he look like?

1760
02:18:40,987 --> 02:18:42,222
l'll show you.

1761
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:48,497
Don't eat it. God
knows who has given this.

1762
02:18:49,162 --> 02:18:52,234
The smell is very familiar.

1763
02:19:01,007 --> 02:19:04,547
Look at this, daddy.
My friend is like this.

1764
02:19:17,123 --> 02:19:18,659
He looks like you, doesn't he?

1765
02:19:18,725 --> 02:19:24,035
No, son. He doesn't look
like me. l look like him.

1766
02:19:25,832 --> 02:19:31,142
And listen.. if you
meet your friend. - Yes.

1767
02:19:32,071 --> 02:19:37,750
Then touch his feet.
You'll feel peaceful.

1768
02:19:39,112 --> 02:19:40,949
lf he keeps his hands on your head.

1769
02:19:48,054 --> 02:19:49,122
Father.

1770
02:19:50,824 --> 02:19:54,765
l was iust waiting for you.
l want to give this card.

1771
02:19:57,998 --> 02:20:02,039
l know.. l should have
come home to give the card.

1772
02:20:03,236 --> 02:20:07,110
But you've forbid us
to enter the house. So..

1773
02:20:08,809 --> 02:20:11,180
Your son has made a free
hospital for poor people..

1774
02:20:11,244 --> 02:20:13,081
..named after you.

1775
02:20:18,251 --> 02:20:22,158
His wish is that you
should inaugurate the hospital.

1776
02:20:22,756 --> 02:20:23,891
We will be pleased.

1777
02:20:38,805 --> 02:20:41,777
Listen, l'm going for the
inauguration of Heera's hospital.

1778
02:20:41,842 --> 02:20:43,110
What if father finds out?

1779
02:20:43,176 --> 02:20:45,481
That's why l'm saying in
case mother or father ask..

1780
02:20:45,546 --> 02:20:47,917
..tell them that
l've gone for shaving.

1781
02:20:47,981 --> 02:20:49,049
Okay.
- Okay.

1782
02:20:52,986 --> 02:20:54,054
Shall l also come?

1783
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:56,959
What are you doing, Usha?
l'm myself going secretly.

1784
02:20:57,023 --> 02:20:58,526
Okay, only you can go.

1785
02:20:59,092 --> 02:21:02,799
lf somebody asks me, l'll tell
them you've gone to the barber.

1786
02:21:02,863 --> 02:21:04,499
Barber?
- Yes.

1787
02:21:04,565 --> 02:21:06,602
Okay. Thank you.

1788
02:21:11,671 --> 02:21:12,740
Grandma.
- Yes.

1789
02:21:12,806 --> 02:21:14,509
Are you also going for shaving?

1790
02:21:14,741 --> 02:21:15,876
Me and shaving?

1791
02:21:16,610 --> 02:21:17,678
Fine, grandma.

1792
02:21:17,744 --> 02:21:20,516
You can go for uncle
Heera's hospital inauguration.

1793
02:21:20,847 --> 02:21:24,521
lf grandpa asks, l'll tell him
that you've gone to the temple.

1794
02:21:25,251 --> 02:21:26,687
My dear grandchild.

1795
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:45,038
Sharada.

1796
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:48,710
Sharada.
- Nobody is at home, grandpa.

1797
02:21:49,476 --> 02:21:52,582
Why?
- Everybody has gone out, grandpa.

1798
02:21:52,646 --> 02:21:53,981
Out?
- Yes, grandpa.

1799
02:21:54,047 --> 02:21:56,151
Father and uncle have gone to town.

1800
02:21:56,215 --> 02:21:58,721
My mother and aunt
have gone to meet granny.

1801
02:21:58,785 --> 02:21:59,987
And grandma has gone to temple.

1802
02:22:05,892 --> 02:22:10,568
Look, l'm going for a
stroll in the garden.

1803
02:22:10,631 --> 02:22:13,503
lf your grandma
returns from the temple..

1804
02:22:13,567 --> 02:22:15,804
..tell her that l'll
be back till lunchtime.

1805
02:22:15,869 --> 02:22:16,937
Fine, grandpa.

1806
02:22:30,083 --> 02:22:31,151
Hello.
- Hello.

1807
02:22:38,257 --> 02:22:39,527
Will father come?

1808
02:22:41,995 --> 02:22:43,631
l'm sure that he'll come.

1809
02:22:49,202 --> 02:22:50,471
Ladies and gentlemen.

1810
02:22:51,871 --> 02:22:58,552
This hospital before you is the
result of only Heera's hard work.

1811
02:23:00,213 --> 02:23:03,720
The dream of building the
hospital was seen by Heera's father.

1812
02:23:04,985 --> 02:23:07,957
But due to some reason
it was not fulfilled.

1813
02:23:10,090 --> 02:23:13,497
After being banished
from father's house..

1814
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:18,168
..travelling in a old bus,
Heera reached this destination.

1815
02:23:25,005 --> 02:23:27,242
Every parent has children.

1816
02:23:28,675 --> 02:23:31,514
But a child like Heera,
who makes his parents..

1817
02:23:31,578 --> 02:23:34,517
..fortunate, is born
only once in blue moon.

1818
02:23:41,522 --> 02:23:43,191
l don't think
father will come, Heera.

1819
02:23:45,892 --> 02:23:46,960
Fine, l'll do something.

1820
02:24:09,816 --> 02:24:12,488
Brothers and sister,
as you all know..

1821
02:24:12,553 --> 02:24:14,490
..Shri Bhanu Pratap Thakur was..

1822
02:24:14,555 --> 02:24:16,959
..going to inaugurate this hospital.

1823
02:24:17,991 --> 02:24:20,496
But as he had to go for
meeting of the village committee..

1824
02:24:20,561 --> 02:24:23,098
..he couldn't come here.

1825
02:24:23,664 --> 02:24:26,503
So he has sent a message
along with his blessings.

1826
02:24:27,501 --> 02:24:31,508
That his grandson,
Junior Bhanu Pratap Thakur..

1827
02:24:31,572 --> 02:24:32,740
..will inaugurate this hospital.

1828
02:25:00,834 --> 02:25:03,038
Thanks for coming here.

1829
02:25:03,537 --> 02:25:06,476
Firstly, l want to
tell you all something.

1830
02:25:07,841 --> 02:25:10,479
A few minutes ago sir had said..

1831
02:25:10,544 --> 02:25:13,716
..this hospital was father's
dream that he couldn't fulfil.

1832
02:25:16,516 --> 02:25:22,160
l want to say that there was
no work that father couldn't do.

1833
02:25:24,891 --> 02:25:29,099
Secondly, father didn't
banish me from the house.

1834
02:25:31,097 --> 02:25:36,106
To make me independent,
he separated me from him.

1835
02:25:42,075 --> 02:25:43,445
When a twig breaks from the tree..

1836
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:46,014
..then the tree and
twig both feel pain.

1837
02:25:47,814 --> 02:25:49,784
l'm sure that my father
must have felt pain like me..

1838
02:25:49,850 --> 02:25:51,453
..in separating me from him.

1839
02:25:53,887 --> 02:25:57,461
People say.. the stone
that Feels pain by the..

1840
02:25:57,524 --> 02:26:00,930
..banging of the hammer..
it can never become an idol.

1841
02:26:02,028 --> 02:26:06,537
The field that is sad by
ploughing can never give yields.

1842
02:26:08,669 --> 02:26:12,476
Scolding of mother
and father are like..

1843
02:26:12,539 --> 02:26:17,482
..hammer and plough.. but
these scolding only teach us..

1844
02:26:17,544 --> 02:26:20,215
..enCOUra9eS US.

1845
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,888
l was a useless fellow.

1846
02:26:27,053 --> 02:26:29,223
But whatever l'm today is
because of father's scolding.

1847
02:26:30,990 --> 02:26:33,496
lf today l'm
independent Then it is..

1848
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:35,497
..because of father's encouragement.

1849
02:26:46,172 --> 02:26:48,075
My father loves me a lot.

1850
02:26:52,512 --> 02:26:56,520
lf today he comes to
know the language of fate..

1851
02:26:56,583 --> 02:27:00,089
..then he would have
touched my forehead.

1852
02:27:21,541 --> 02:27:25,816
Oh my God! So many people!
So much applaud!

1853
02:27:26,145 --> 02:27:28,718
So much commotion! So many praises!

1854
02:27:28,782 --> 02:27:29,850
You're talking about what?

1855
02:27:29,916 --> 02:27:31,819
Heera's hospital inauguration.

1856
02:27:33,286 --> 02:27:35,891
You'd gone there?
- Why would l go there?

1857
02:27:35,956 --> 02:27:38,828
Our neighbour Vimla
had gone. She told me.

1858
02:27:41,294 --> 02:27:43,966
He was talking only about
you in the entire speech.

1859
02:27:44,498 --> 02:27:46,768
You know what he
said in your praises?

1860
02:27:48,935 --> 02:27:53,009
He said that you are
responsible for his progress.

1861
02:27:53,774 --> 02:27:56,513
With your
encouragement and blessings..

1862
02:27:56,576 --> 02:27:58,747
..he was successful in
building the hospital.

1863
02:27:59,178 --> 02:28:03,521
And yes, for your
scolding he was saying..

1864
02:28:03,583 --> 02:28:08,794
..stone.. hammer..
plough, earth.. something..

1865
02:28:08,855 --> 02:28:10,525
No, he didn't say this.

1866
02:28:12,091 --> 02:28:14,196
l mean.. he might have said.

1867
02:28:14,961 --> 02:28:20,539
The stone that cries
with the banging of hammer..

1868
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:24,608
..it can't be an idol.

1869
02:28:24,905 --> 02:28:28,545
The field that is
sad to be ploughed..

1870
02:28:28,608 --> 02:28:31,046
..it can't give yields.

1871
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:32,213
Something in the similar lines.

1872
02:28:33,046 --> 02:28:34,816
Where did you hear all this?

1873
02:28:35,181 --> 02:28:37,619
lt is an old proverb.
l'd learn in the 4th class.

1874
02:28:39,886 --> 02:28:40,954
Why are you looking like this?

1875
02:28:41,755 --> 02:28:44,927
l'm seeing that you still
remember 4th class studies.

1876
02:28:44,991 --> 02:28:46,059
What is so great?

1877
02:28:46,125 --> 02:28:47,929
People remember A, B, C
taught in the 1st class.

1878
02:28:47,994 --> 02:28:50,833
Forget it. l thought
that you had gone there.

1879
02:28:52,231 --> 02:28:55,772
l spotted your clothes
right there in the crowd.

1880
02:28:56,636 --> 02:28:58,907
How did it go there?

1881
02:28:58,972 --> 02:29:03,981
l don't know. Hitherto it
used to be on your shoulder.

1882
02:29:04,511 --> 02:29:08,117
Maybe it walked on its own today.
It is modern world.

1883
02:29:08,181 --> 02:29:09,951
Anything can happen.

1884
02:29:14,253 --> 02:29:16,157
Dear Sonu, breakfast is ready.

1885
02:29:16,222 --> 02:29:19,127
Mummy, l'm late. l'll eat it later.

1886
02:29:19,759 --> 02:29:22,097
Hello, Sonu. Where are you going?

1887
02:29:22,963 --> 02:29:24,866
l'm going to meet my friend, daddy.

1888
02:29:25,566 --> 02:29:28,270
So today he's coming to meet you?

1889
02:29:28,935 --> 02:29:31,272
No, today l'm going to meet him.

1890
02:29:31,638 --> 02:29:34,275
Oh, so you're going to meet him.
- Yes.

1891
02:29:34,975 --> 02:29:36,043
What are you taking for him?

1892
02:29:36,910 --> 02:29:38,613
Nothing. What should l take?

1893
02:29:41,648 --> 02:29:45,221
Let's do one thing. Today
take 'Kheer' for him. - 'Kheer'?

1894
02:29:45,852 --> 02:29:49,693
Yes. - How do you know
that he likes 'Kheer'?

1895
02:29:50,524 --> 02:29:53,630
Like how he knows
that l like sweets.

1896
02:29:56,696 --> 02:29:58,934
Come, have breakfast.
And l'll prepare 'Kheer'.

1897
02:30:05,972 --> 02:30:09,244
'Where does he go
everyday at this time?'

1898
02:30:38,539 --> 02:30:39,741
Hi, buddy!

1899
02:30:43,777 --> 02:30:46,782
Hey! Come, come, come.
- Hi.

1900
02:30:49,916 --> 02:30:53,490
Sorry, buddy. l got late.
- No problem.

1901
02:30:53,554 --> 02:30:55,089
Okay. Let's go.

1902
02:31:01,495 --> 02:31:05,669
Buddy, you like 'Kheer', don't you?
- Who told you?

1903
02:31:05,732 --> 02:31:06,867
My daddy.

1904
02:31:06,933 --> 02:31:08,736
This child is Heera Thakur's son.

1905
02:31:09,135 --> 02:31:11,072
Senior Thakur comes here
everyday to meet this child.

1906
02:31:12,238 --> 02:31:13,674
What else did your daddy say?

1907
02:31:14,107 --> 02:31:16,912
He said you're like God.

1908
02:31:16,977 --> 02:31:21,251
He told me to greet
you when l see you.

1909
02:31:23,249 --> 02:31:27,524
Eat 'Kheer', buddy.
- l just had my breakfast.

1910
02:31:28,522 --> 02:31:32,596
l'll take this home.
l'll eat it there. - Okay.

1911
02:31:33,527 --> 02:31:34,595
Let's go.

1912
02:31:38,532 --> 02:31:41,169
Do come tomorrow. Bye.
- Bye.

1913
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:45,138
Grandpa.

1914
02:31:51,111 --> 02:31:55,018
God knows why l felt
like calling you grandpa.

1915
02:31:55,081 --> 02:31:56,149
And l called you.

1916
02:32:14,234 --> 02:32:17,708
Henceforth you'll call me grandpa.
- Okay.

1917
02:32:18,972 --> 02:32:20,040
Go.

1918
02:32:36,156 --> 02:32:38,528
Sir, somebody has
fainted on the street.

1919
02:32:40,561 --> 02:32:41,562
Driver, stop the car.

1920
02:32:49,202 --> 02:32:50,471
Driver, give me the key.

1921
02:32:50,537 --> 02:32:51,672
No, nothing will happen with key.

1922
02:32:51,738 --> 02:32:52,940
Bring a piece of wood. Okay.

1923
02:32:54,474 --> 02:32:56,211
Hold his arms.
- Sir.

1924
02:33:11,024 --> 02:33:13,496
Yes. Come.
- Be careful.

1925
02:33:15,228 --> 02:33:17,900
You saved my life as
the messiah of God.

1926
02:33:18,498 --> 02:33:20,769
l'll always be indebted to you.

1927
02:33:20,834 --> 02:33:23,773
Okay, go carefully.
Take your luggage.

1928
02:33:35,181 --> 02:33:37,586
What happened, sir?
- Nothing.

1929
02:33:40,821 --> 02:33:41,822
Let's go, driver.

1930
02:33:50,797 --> 02:33:52,467
From where have you
brought this 'Kheer'?

1931
02:33:52,532 --> 02:33:53,668
One of my friends gave it to me.

1932
02:33:55,869 --> 02:33:59,208
Which friend?
- You don't know him.

1933
02:34:00,206 --> 02:34:01,475
He's my childhood friend.

1934
02:34:01,541 --> 02:34:05,048
ls he your childhood friend..
or a kid who is friend?

1935
02:34:23,062 --> 02:34:25,935
l know. You meet your grandson.

1936
02:34:30,136 --> 02:34:33,510
Yes, l meet him! l met him.

1937
02:34:33,573 --> 02:34:34,642
Why?

1938
02:34:36,843 --> 02:34:39,515
The one whom you
estranged from yourself..

1939
02:34:39,579 --> 02:34:41,517
..why so much of fervour for him?

1940
02:34:42,449 --> 02:34:45,053
Because he is your son? Heera's son?

1941
02:34:45,585 --> 02:34:48,525
Or because your other
sons don't have a son?

1942
02:34:49,055 --> 02:34:52,896
Or because he is
Iast heir of our family?

1943
02:34:54,461 --> 02:34:57,098
Why? Why didn't you
stand firm on your decision?

1944
02:34:57,163 --> 02:34:59,033
l'm not the only
wrong doer, Sharada.

1945
02:35:01,468 --> 02:35:03,805
For mistake and punishment..
for these 2 words..

1946
02:35:03,870 --> 02:35:05,573
..2 people are responsible.

1947
02:35:06,206 --> 02:35:08,878
Either the son wasn't like him
or the father was not like me.

1948
02:35:08,942 --> 02:35:10,645
Son is iust like him.

1949
02:35:11,144 --> 02:35:14,016
ln this age, parents
don't Banish children.

1950
02:35:14,548 --> 02:35:16,485
ln fact children
banish their parents.

1951
02:35:19,219 --> 02:35:22,492
Heera whom you threw
away as a useless son..

1952
02:35:22,556 --> 02:35:24,493
..today he has become so renowned..

1953
02:35:24,558 --> 02:35:27,497
..that people don't say that
Bhanu Pratap Thakur's son..

1954
02:35:27,561 --> 02:35:29,564
..is passing by when they see him.

1955
02:35:30,163 --> 02:35:33,503
ln fact they see you and
say that Heera's father..

1956
02:35:33,567 --> 02:35:35,570
..Bhanu Pratap Thakur is passing by.

1957
02:35:36,236 --> 02:35:39,743
What pride can be
greater than this for a father?

1958
02:35:44,911 --> 02:35:48,952
Your other sons think that
your inheritance is theirs.

1959
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:53,056
Heera considers you
as his inheritance.

1960
02:35:55,655 --> 02:35:59,897
You don't visit those rooms of
this villa that have small doors.

1961
02:36:01,628 --> 02:36:04,132
Because you don't like
to bow your head and walk.

1962
02:36:05,198 --> 02:36:09,640
Then how did you bow before
the desire of a small child?

1963
02:36:22,916 --> 02:36:26,490
Now that you've bowed..

1964
02:36:26,553 --> 02:36:30,861
..bring back your son and grandson.

1965
02:36:33,827 --> 02:36:36,933
Like you, even l'm craving.

1966
02:36:38,598 --> 02:36:42,506
Till 6 years, the heart that..

1967
02:36:42,569 --> 02:36:46,510
..had given relief to Heera..

1968
02:36:46,573 --> 02:36:49,512
..that heart is craving..

1969
02:36:49,576 --> 02:36:52,581
.. for him since the past 6 years.

1970
02:37:07,126 --> 02:37:08,195
Hello.

1971
02:37:21,908 --> 02:37:22,976
He..
- Hello.

1972
02:37:29,049 --> 02:37:30,117
Hello.

1973
02:37:37,290 --> 02:37:38,559
Heera..

1974
02:37:42,128 --> 02:37:43,196
Heera!

1975
02:37:48,969 --> 02:37:50,037
Heera!

1976
02:37:52,038 --> 02:37:53,608
Hey! Somebody there!

1977
02:38:39,285 --> 02:38:44,896
Oh my God! Very bad!

1978
02:38:45,224 --> 02:38:49,166
Don't cry! Don't cry!
Have faith in God!

1979
02:38:49,696 --> 02:38:52,501
Even God will think 10
times before taking..

1980
02:38:52,566 --> 02:38:54,569
..the life of a great
man like your father.

1981
02:38:55,869 --> 02:38:59,643
But how did all this happen?
- Heera poisoned him.

1982
02:39:02,241 --> 02:39:04,245
What! Heera poisoned him!

1983
02:39:04,844 --> 02:39:06,915
He used to worship
his father like God!

1984
02:39:07,648 --> 02:39:09,518
Thakur sir, don't you know.

1985
02:39:10,050 --> 02:39:11,920
Senior Thakur had
banished Heera from the house.

1986
02:39:12,653 --> 02:39:14,890
Father and son had
become sworn enemies.

1987
02:39:14,955 --> 02:39:17,259
Yes!
- You're talking rubbish!

1988
02:39:17,824 --> 02:39:19,527
lf Heera considered
his father as enemy..

1989
02:39:19,593 --> 02:39:21,964
..then why would he start
all his business in his name?

1990
02:39:22,261 --> 02:39:24,132
Why would he have named this
hospital after his father?

1991
02:39:24,197 --> 02:39:27,269
Thakur sir, for money
today's children can do anything!

1992
02:39:27,534 --> 02:39:28,602
Yes!

1993
02:39:45,218 --> 02:39:46,487
Stop!

1994
02:39:48,088 --> 02:39:49,791
Let me see father once, Bhabhi.

1995
02:39:50,156 --> 02:39:52,159
Don't cry crocodile
tears after killing him.

1996
02:39:52,225 --> 02:39:53,494
Bhabhi, what are..

1997
02:39:55,161 --> 02:39:58,000
Since childhood l've only
prayed for his long life.

1998
02:39:58,064 --> 02:40:00,803
And since childhood you were
nursing the desire to kill him.

1999
02:40:00,867 --> 02:40:01,935
No, Bhabhi!

2000
02:40:02,902 --> 02:40:04,171
The person before whom l
didn't had the courage to..

2001
02:40:04,237 --> 02:40:06,074
..raise my head will l
have the courage to kill him?

2002
02:40:06,139 --> 02:40:09,178
That's why.. you
killed him by deceit.

2003
02:40:09,242 --> 02:40:11,880
What are you saying, Varun?
Don't you trust your brother?

2004
02:40:11,945 --> 02:40:15,519
Hold on. l'll find out the truth.

2005
02:40:15,582 --> 02:40:17,619
Hey, bring the child.

2006
02:40:20,987 --> 02:40:24,259
So sweet child.
Just like your father.

2007
02:40:25,526 --> 02:40:28,531
Tell me, who gave
'Kheer' to grandpa?

2008
02:40:28,595 --> 02:40:30,732
- l did. Really?

2009
02:40:31,532 --> 02:40:35,640
Tell me, who had told you
to give 'Kheer' to grandpa?

2010
02:40:36,269 --> 02:40:37,538
Daddy.

2011
02:40:39,773 --> 02:40:40,841
You heard him?

2012
02:40:41,274 --> 02:40:46,818
As far as l know, children are
no less than God. They never lie.

2013
02:40:47,681 --> 02:40:50,486
And this child is clearly
saying that Heera had given..

2014
02:40:50,551 --> 02:40:52,621
..the poisonous 'Kheer'.

2015
02:40:53,953 --> 02:40:56,693
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

2016
02:40:56,757 --> 02:41:00,965
Stop! Look.. listen to me!

2017
02:41:01,795 --> 02:41:04,800
Daddy! Daddy! Leave my daddy alone!

2018
02:41:04,864 --> 02:41:05,933
No!

2019
02:41:05,999 --> 02:41:08,838
Sonu! Sonu!

2020
02:41:08,902 --> 02:41:11,607
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

2021
02:41:20,614 --> 02:41:22,884
Beat him! Beat him! Beat him!

2022
02:41:28,888 --> 02:41:30,659
Kill him! Kill him!

2023
02:42:55,642 --> 02:42:58,481
Deshansh! Bhanu Pratap is that man..

2024
02:42:58,545 --> 02:43:03,955
..who could strangle his son's
throat if they make a mistake.

2025
02:43:05,485 --> 02:43:09,493
And if wrongly someone touches..

2026
02:43:09,556 --> 02:43:13,997
..them, l'll slit their throats!

2027
02:43:46,660 --> 02:43:48,630
You mixed poison in the 'Kheer'.

2028
02:43:49,563 --> 02:43:54,004
l'd sniffed your pe_ume in my car.

2029
02:43:55,134 --> 02:43:56,872
But l was thinking
about something else.

2030
02:43:57,938 --> 02:43:59,508
l forgot about it.

2031
