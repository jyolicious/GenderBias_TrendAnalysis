1
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:53,947
Dehradun, a beautiful
paradise in the mountains...

2
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,715
...is situated far away from
hustle and bustle of humanity.

3
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:02,488
And in this paradise are
12 chosen school of India.

4
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,359
The very affluent
families of India...

5
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,568
...send their children here
for a good education.

6
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:14,570
Some own steel mills
and some, tea estates.

7
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,039
Every child is the
heir to millions.

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,240
Rajput School and College
is considered to be the best.

9
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,320
It excels in academics
and is the best at sports.

10
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:34,252
Similarly, Queens Junior
College is the best for girls.

11
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,921
The boys from all the
colleges are crazy about them.

12
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,333
There is a place called
Mallroad, is centrally located.

13
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,801
Here you find the shops
run by the locals.

14
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,443
The children of the poor locals
have an ordinary school.

15
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,676
The speciality of the boys here
is a poor academic record...

16
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,280
...and a good record
for bad behaviour.

17
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:04,020
The exams are
fast approaching...

18
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,422
...but the preparation at
Model College is different.

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,530
If they have any goal, it is the
girls from Queens college.

20
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,633
Like every year,
the exams are over.

21
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,638
There is going to be an Inter
College sports competition.

22
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:25,436
The entire colony is busy
discussing who will...

23
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,842
...be the winner of Inter
College cup, this year.

24
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,661
Squeeze it a little more.
Pass me the spanner.

25
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,130
- Ratan's cycle is ready?
- Just a while longer.

26
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,395
All right, I'll send Ratan over.

27
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,062
- Uncle, have some tea.
- No, I don't have the time.

28
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,174
Give me number 13.

29
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,613
Does Ratan have any chances
of winning the cycle race?

30
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,181
I don't know. But he is the
champion of our college.

31
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,188
- Hurry up. The boys are waiting.
- Yes, father.

32
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:20,161
Mr. Shakur, I am but a math
teacher at Model College.

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,634
Ask Mr. Ramlal about the probable
winners and losers in sports.

34
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,102
He is the coach.

35
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,469
Well, Mr. Ramlal, how are the
sports preparations getting on?

36
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,768
- Quite fine, Mr. Dube.
- Oh, really!

37
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,381
- Shakur, you'll take charge
for a few days. - Yes, sir.

38
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,711
Here is some money
for the expenses.

39
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,863
Why are you standing idle?

40
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,236
Don't you have to
train the Model boys?

41
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,643
Or... Have you given up
the idea of competing?

42
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,213
Since the time the Rajput boys
won the tournament last year...

43
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,614
...they seem to be walking
on air. The stupid...!

44
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:50,853
Criticism won't help. Our boys
will lag behind in every test.

45
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,447
That's not true, Mr. Dube.

46
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:58,186
I am not referring to Ratan but
to your younger son, Sanjay.

47
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,765
If he passes the exams this
year, I will distribute sweets.

48
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,131
I will do it... And plenty, too!

49
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:17,410
- Sanjaylal... I've found mine!
Only 2 marks! - Change it.

50
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,883
Pass it quickly... Have
you found yours?

51
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,488
- Hey! I've found mine.
- Let me have a look.

52
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:24,647
None of my sums are right.

53
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,925
Hurry up.

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,822
Hey, someone's here!

55
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,160
Who is there?

56
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:36,724
Who is there?

57
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,681
Thief! Stop him!

58
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,954
There he goes... Stop him!

59
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,996
Stop the thief!
Hey M ister, stop him!

60
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,670
- What were they doing?
- They were changing results.

61
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,269
- What happened?
- Everything's alright.

62
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,276
- Did Ratan tell father anything?
- No.

63
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,211
If father would have known,
that would be the end of me.

64
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,628
Once again I lied to uncle
Ramlal to protect Sanju.

65
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:44,362
I don't know why, but I believe
that I can do anything for him.

66
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,146
I am still unaware of
his feelings for me.

67
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,187
Ratan, you changed my marks
in math again, didn't you?

68
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,829
Yes, my dear.

69
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,991
I will fail and you will
be responsible for it.

70
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,427
Be grateful that I
did not tell father.

71
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,667
For then, you would have been
thrown out as you were, my dear.

72
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,776
Hey! I don't fear anyone.

73
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,505
Besides, why are
you patronising me?

74
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,911
- Do you know what your
problem is? - What?

75
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,949
You want to achieve success
without any hard work.

76
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,419
Don't you know
what integrity is?

77
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,080
Sure. You are the
epitome of integrity.

78
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,418
You are ' Mahatma Gandhi'...
you are 'Sarojini Naidu'.

79
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,825
Hold this.

80
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,400
Let me have a look. Wow!
Father was in great shape.

81
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,378
Hey, where did you find this?

82
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:08,714
In 1965 Model College beat
Rajput in the cycle race...

83
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,416
...for the first
and the last time.

84
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,688
My friends had brought me
home on their shoulders.

85
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,494
Neither have I, nor have the
rest of our locals forgotten it.

86
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,465
The same event will
take place tomorrow.

87
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,060
All eyes are on you, Ratan.

88
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:31,075
- Who are the brave boys?
- Rajputs!

89
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,542
- Who are the leaders?
- Rajputs!

90
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,095
At the Inter School
sports meet...

91
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,362
...Shekhar Malhotra,
the last year's...

92
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,370
...winner of Rajput College
is at the fourth position

93
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,045
Shekhar Malhotra is first,
Ratanlal Sharma is second.

94
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,478
And Randhir Thapar is
at the third position.

95
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,779
It appears that Sanjaylal
Sharma has sprained his ankle.

96
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,549
- What happened?
- I sprained my ankle, else...

97
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,651
Otherwise you would have come
first. What lame excuses!

98
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,603
Once again, Shekhar is first,
Ratanlal is second position.

99
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,146
Chances are that Rajput will
take championship once again.

100
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,315
Xavier's is leading at 245.
Rajput is second at 225.

101
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,745
- Model is third at 210.
- I sprained my ankle.

102
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,546
6 schools are participating
in this event.

103
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,227
The first baton has changed
hands at 100 metres.

104
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,556
Rajput College is in the
lead and Xavier's is next.

105
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,992
The baton has changed
hands again at 200 metres.

106
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,799
Model is at the second.
Whereas Rajput is still in the lead.

107
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,337
The third baton has been
passed to Shekhar Malhotra...

108
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,468
...and Ratanlal Sharma is
at his best to forge ahead.

109
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:16,845
And... What a wonderful
victory by Ratanlal Sharma.

110
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,940
And Model School gets
20 additional points.

111
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,052
That was wonderful, Mr. Ramlal.

112
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,385
The 100m hurdle
race has started.

113
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,120
And Ratanlal has displayed
a miracle once again.

114
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,324
But Rajput is still
at the same position.

115
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,002
According to
the score board...

116
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:45,407
...the Inter School
Championship is entirely...

117
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,072
...dependant on the
marathon cycle race.

118
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,548
It's tough competition between
Rajput, Xavier's and Model.

119
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,486
And now, whosoever
wins this cycle race...

120
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,149
...will be deserving of the
Inter School championship.

121
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,003
And the 50 km marathon
cycling has started.

122
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,639
The participants will leave the
stadium, on uneven terrain...

123
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,512
...to reach the highest
point and return.

124
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:30,018
We will be getting reports from
3 check points along the way.

125
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:42,023
'We will be successful'
' Model College'

126
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,939
The cyclists have
reached here...

127
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,645
...and they are proceeding at great
speed towards Baramulla Hills.

128
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,908
I, Rakesh Sharma from
Pillar Rock check point...

129
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,343
...welcome the
spectators at the stadium.

130
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,914
The cyclists will be
here at any moment now.

131
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,648
In first place, is Randhir
Thapar from Xavier's College.

132
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,751
In second place is
Vinay from Andrew's.

133
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,260
In third place is Shekhar
Malhotra from Rajput.

134
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,730
In fourth place is Ratanlal
Sharma from Model College.

135
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,950
And now the cyclists are
approaching the stadium.

136
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,291
At first place is Xavier's
followed by Lawrence...

137
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,696
Andrew's is third
and Peter's is fourth.

138
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,230
Next is Rajput
followed by Model.

139
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,267
The stadium has 5 tracks.

140
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,169
And Lawrence has
taken the lead.

141
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,302
Shekhar Malhotra
is trying his best.

142
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:39,246
And... he has
overtaken Peter's.

143
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,376
Ratanlal from Model
is just behind him.

144
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,977
They have forged
ahead of Andrews...

145
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,989
...and have now
crossed Lawrence, too.

146
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,886
They are in second place.

147
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,817
Now they have gone ahead of
Xavier's, taken the first place.

148
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,410
He missed by a hair's
breadth, Mr. Ramlal.

149
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,550
He would have defeated
Shekhar otherwise.

150
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,519
No, Dube I believe
in one motto alone...

151
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,821
..."He who wins
is the conqueror".

152
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,781
Rajput School is not
only famous for its...

153
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,959
A good education can be obtained
at any other place too.

154
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,623
The only difference is that
he boys of this school...

155
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,636
...are taught to be
leaders in every field.

156
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,032
The proof of this is the
Inter School Sports shield.

157
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,214
The person chosen as
the sports captain...

158
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,308
...this year is
the young man...

159
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,817
...who has taken
the responsibility...

160
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,823
...to win this shield.

161
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:42,324
He is Shekhar Malhotra.

162
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,028
I am sure that you will
win it the third time too...

163
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,436
...and set a new record.

164
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,113
- Who are the brave boys?
- Rajput!

165
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,586
- Who are the leaders?
- Rajput!

166
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,765
- Sanju.
- Yes, father?

167
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,792
- Have you got your results?
- No, not yet.

168
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,604
You got your results
a fortnight ago.

169
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:30,733
It was under your pillow.

170
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,707
Leave alone lying, you have
no regrets about failing.

171
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,713
You still keep loitering with
your good-for-nothing friends.

172
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,581
If it was someone with dignity,
would have had sleepless nights.

173
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,279
He would have found
it difficult to swallow.

174
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,627
Shakur, let him go! He'll come
around when he's hungry.

175
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,299
Are you aware that Sanju,
Maksood and Ghanshyam...

176
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,310
...have failed again?
And now, these scoundrels...

177
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,845
...will be in your class.

178
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,540
Why do you associate
with those loafers?

179
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,709
Aren't there any nice
girls in your class?

180
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,651
They talk nonsense.
And they talk about high ideals!

181
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,448
Their language is horrible.

182
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:26,653
They abuse a lot and use
slang while speaking.

183
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,333
Wow!
What language!

184
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,133
- What do you want?
- I wanted the newspaper.

185
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,071
- Do you want the price
of gold? - Pardon me.

186
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,747
It is right there, take it.
...And bring me my wallet.

187
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,456
- Anjali, give me a napkin.
- I'm coming, father.

188
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,836
- Ratan.
- Yes, father.

189
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,911
Here's a new blazer for you.

190
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,540
You will be receiving
an award today...

191
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,746
...so don't wear the old one.
- Yes father.

192
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,484
- Take this money.
- That's not necessary.

193
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,256
Keep it, and don't forget to
pay respects to your mother.

194
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,160
I will.

195
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,234
Ratan, your new
blazer looks great.

196
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,729
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

197
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,070
- Ratan, I want Rs. 50.
Do you want to buy books?

198
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,074
- Aren't you giving it to me?
- No.

199
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:24,846
Did you see that?
Ratan gets a new blazer...

200
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,852
...as well as money
and I don't get anything.

201
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,880
It happens
with me always.

202
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,557
Take a look at my shoes
...They're torn.

203
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,269
Sanju, do you need money?

204
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,471
- Do you have any?
- How much do you want?

205
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:55,536
- 40... 50.
- I'll get it.

206
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,850
You, idiot! You are taking
advantage of her feelings?

207
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,748
Don't talk nonsense!
She is my good friend...

208
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,486
...and cares about me.
Unlike you.

209
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,495
Ramlal's efforts are
the sole reason...

210
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,899
...behind the fine performance
by Pradip Kumar...

211
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,904
...Afzal Khan and
Ratanlal of our school.

212
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,965
And Ratanlal came second
in the marathon cycle race.

213
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,247
For this achievement,
he is awarded...

214
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,906
...the school champion badge.

215
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:44,519
This is your final year, Ratan.
This time you must come first.

216
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,364
I'll try my best.

217
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:16,720
"He is called as a
conqueror friends."

218
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:24,567
"He who knows how to
win a losing battle."

219
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,665
"The day we come into
the field euphoric."

220
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,574
"We will conquer
with a victory."

221
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:47,684
"He is called as a
conqueror friends."

222
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,697
"Why should we go
along with the world."

223
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,604
"Why should we bugger our
selves with excercise?"

224
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:06,405
"Why should we be scared of
parents or the teachers?"

225
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,076
"We are the
conquerors here."

226
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,741
"We can tackle
with everyone."

227
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:15,282
"Beware of us my friends."

228
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,618
"If they don't understand us."

229
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,717
"How does it matter to us?

230
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:30,593
"We know how to win
a losing battle."

231
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,015
"These lanes are ours
as well as the roads."

232
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,549
"Why should we feel scared?"

233
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,856
"Any one messing with us."

234
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:37,368
"Will get aside
feeling scared."

235
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,767
"We are the
conquerors here."

236
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,205
"We can tackle
with everyone."

237
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,733
"Don't mess
with us my dears."

238
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,816
"If they don't
understand us,"

239
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,374
"How does it matter to us."

240
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:57,414
"These beautiful
innocent angels."

241
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,213
"Are all crazy for wealth."

242
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:05,222
"When they realise the
value of true love."

243
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,623
"They will go
crazy about us."

244
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,957
"We are the
conquerors here."

245
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,863
"We can tackle
with everyone."

246
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,370
"We also are no less
than any princes."

247
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:33,144
"We know how to win
a losing battle."

248
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:06,049
Hey! ...Stupid...!

249
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,862
Take a look at that boy. He's
eating nuts like a monkey.

250
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,466
- He looks like one.
- Look at his antics.

251
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:31,666
- What will you have?
- A cheese sandwich.

252
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,541
2 cheese sandwiches.
...And make it snappy.

253
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,546
Sanju, make two milk shakes.
Ramu, make two cheese toasts.

254
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,210
Get up!

255
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:04,400
Look at him.
He is making a pass.

256
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,519
I have a good
mind to hit them.

257
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,064
Now watch the charm
of Shekhar Malhotra.

258
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,837
Who doesn't know the
inter college champion?

259
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:50,278
We visited Sidney point today.
It is a beautiful place.

260
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,555
- Will you come along
sometime? - Sure.

261
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,289
Chilled.

262
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,396
He's too proud of himself.

263
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,868
You've fetched the bottles but
forgotten the straws... Fool!

264
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,311
He's got the
intelligence of a child.

265
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,666
Ignore them.
They are jealous of you.

266
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,002
He panicked.

267
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,008
The Xavier's boys
are scoundrels.

268
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,983
Idiot!
What have you done!

269
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:53,298
How did this happen?
How did this happen?!

270
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,132
The boys from Xavier's
and Rajput had a scuffle...

271
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,032
...and they broke
the furniture.

272
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,439
By fighting over a couple of
girls from Queens college...

273
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,142
...you have maligned the
reputation of Rajput college.

274
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,485
If you have a tendency to
fight, like goons then...

275
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,283
...you should have
joined a sleazy college.

276
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,824
And you, Shekhar...
The captain of this college...

277
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,262
Weren't you ashamed of
quarreling at an ordinary cafe?

278
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,762
Sir, it was my fault.
It won't occur again.

279
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,502
If it occurs again,
you will be suspended.

280
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,509
You will not be permitted to
leave the hostel for two weeks.

281
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,725
Stop it, Sanju.

282
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,867
Did you speak to the
Principal of Rajput College?

283
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,938
Yes. Damage was
done to us but...

284
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,496
...they weren't
sufficiently punished.

285
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,633
Go and complain some more.

286
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:10,103
Why were you jealous?
Was it because a Rajput boy...

287
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,614
...easily charmed
a girl from Queens.

288
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,148
What nonsense! I don't care
about such cheap girls.

289
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,550
As if they care about you.

290
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,887
My dear brother, any
girl who could knock...

291
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,360
...Sanju out of his senses.

292
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,030
...has not stepped
on the earth as yet.

293
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,917
- Who is the new girl?
- She must be the spoiled...

294
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,928
...brat of a rich father.

295
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,692
Hey!
Are you blind?

296
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:40,069
He's gone.
Look at him.

297
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,253
They are asking for trouble.

298
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,845
2 chocolate milk shakes.

299
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,155
- How are you?
- Who are you?

300
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:07,493
I'm Ganshu. Have you forgotten?
We met in Delhi...

301
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,432
...at the market.
We were having snacks.

302
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,025
Don't you remember, Rina?

303
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,000
My name is not Rina, but Tina.

304
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,610
What will you have, Tina?

305
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:26,376
Or, will you have Chikoo?
It is great...

306
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,691
We won't do it again!

307
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,431
The old woman has a firm
hand. She has skinned me.

308
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,466
Aren't you new? I thought
I'd accompany you.

309
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,711
The boys in the blue blazers
are from Rajput college.

310
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,147
They come from
affluent families.

311
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,647
The boys in red blazers
are from Xavier's.

312
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,750
And those boys
in green blazers?

313
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,825
Don't even look at them.
They are from Model College.

314
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:16,128
They are trash.
We call them jerks.

315
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,860
Jerks?
Yes, dear.

316
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:24,169
They are jerks who look
like hungry wolves.

317
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,409
I have decided never
to make a pass...

318
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,004
...at any girl from
Queens college.

319
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,417
Hey... Who is she?

320
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,771
- Wow!
- O Lord!

321
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,729
Boys are dropping dead.
Should I call the ambulance?

322
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,477
Who is that boy with
the yellow headband?

323
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,572
He is J. K. Malhotra's son.

324
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,583
The owner of
Malhotra Steel M ills?

325
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,920
There is no girl worth knowing.
Neither is your Richa around.

326
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,121
- What did you do the last time?
- Nothing, just a kiss.

327
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,824
A good night kiss!
Your kiss is sufficient.

328
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,298
Who is that girl?

329
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,983
She must be new.

330
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,650
Seated beside her is
Ruksana, from Queens...

331
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,985
...who always says 'dear'.

332
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,867
She is impressed.

333
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,267
Hey! ...He's gone.

334
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,203
The idiot!
...He's gone to prey.

335
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,978
- Do you know me?
- Who doesn't?

336
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,919
Scoundrel!
Why are you laughing?

337
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,650
It angers me, that a rogue
is fooling a naive girl.

338
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,983
One ought to tell her that
Shekhar was dating Richa.

339
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,595
Don't worry, Sanju. I'll take her
aside and explain everything.

340
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,659
Even I can take her aside in
the corner if it is necessary.

341
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,001
Everyone has a corner
but no one has a girl friend.

342
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,268
- Hey... I'll beat you!
- Just you wait.

343
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:38,151
- What nonsense? - Will you
complain about this too?

344
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:42,666
I don't have the time for this
bickering. We are here to train.

345
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:48,661
Whose training? ...Are
these your champions?

346
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,674
And take a look at
this bag of bones.

347
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,171
Look Paunchy, there's
no need to be angry.

348
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,686
As for the cycle race, I'm
the champion around here.

349
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,690
No local boy can beat me!

350
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,193
And I shall win the
race this year too...

351
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,196
...and blacken the faces
of these scoundrels.

352
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,199
You're a scoundrel! Your entire
family is full of scoundrels!

353
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,700
I'll break your face.

354
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,705
- I'll break your face. - Why
are you fighting with them?

355
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,711
Hey fighter, pay
heed to your dad...

356
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,713
...or else you'll
be severely beaten.

357
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,121
Let's disperse.

358
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,133
Uncle, I've brought
a vegetable dish.

359
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,136
I have already eaten.
They will have it.

360
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,741
Sanju, will you have some?

361
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,747
I won't spare them.

362
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,248
Why are you kicking
up a storm?

363
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,251
Forget about
what happened.

364
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,753
How can I?
You are afraid of them.

365
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:15,750
They insulted father and you
kept mum! You are gutless.

366
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,259
I am not afraid of anyone.

367
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,262
Then, why did you keep mum?

368
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,764
Violence is not the solution.

369
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,265
Neither is submission.

370
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,760
Sanju is right. We ought
to give them a fit reply.

371
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,273
Today they were spared
because of father.

372
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,275
Next time I won't spare them.

373
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,782
What will you do?
You talk utter rubbish.

374
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,286
Shekhar is proud
and very ill-mannered.

375
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,289
Ratan will break his pride.

376
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,783
Ratan, I have decided to buy
an imported cycle for you.

377
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,796
But father, an imported
cycle costs...

378
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,798
...around 12 to
15 thousand rupees.

379
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,302
It's alright.
I'll save every penny...

380
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,304
...and I'll even
borrow if I have to.

381
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,798
Didn't he say that no
local boy could beat him?

382
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:10,313
This year, he will not win but
leave in defeat at your hands.

383
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,318
- Where did you go with Shekhar?
- Nowhere in particular.

384
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,831
- What did you do?
- We had a casual conversation.

385
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,332
Did anything interesting happen?

386
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,834
That will take place tomorrow.

387
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,336
But we're going to Sidney point
on a school picnic tomorrow.

388
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,341
- Is Shekhar coming there?
- Yes.

389
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:41,845
He said that he would fling
himself from Sidney point...

390
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,345
...if I'm not there.

391
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,859
- Deposit this Rs 1000 in
the bank. - Alright, father.

392
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,361
I'm off to Mr. Dube's place
and I'll have my meal there.

393
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:07,359
Ramu, return these empty crates
to the soft drink delivery man...

394
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,871
...and take delivery of
4 crates of soft drinks.

395
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,873
I'll settle the
accounts when I return.

396
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,378
Sanju, put this
bread in the oven.

397
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,383
Take this.
I'm going to the bank.

398
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,885
I'll go to the bank instead.

399
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,887
Father has directed
me to go to the bank.

400
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,401
- Do you need something?
- I need some bread?

401
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,404
Bread... Take a seat.

402
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,406
- No, it's alright.
- Please sit.

403
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,909
I'll bake some fresh
bread and get it for you.

404
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,404
Sanju, go to the bank.
I'll bake the bread.

405
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,408
No, you go to the bank and I'll
bake the bread for Kalpana.

406
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,421
Don't act smart.

407
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,924
Oh, all right...
But take my advice.

408
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,420
Grab her and give her a kiss.

409
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,936
Come on friends,
it's too hot out here.

410
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:16,439
"They spoke
with their eyes."

411
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,432
"And found life partners."

412
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,447
Oh... The bread!

413
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:32,955
Hey!
What are you doing?

414
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,957
This is Mr. Wadia's car.
If he comes to know...

415
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,458
...I'll be in trouble.

416
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,461
Damn, Wadia.

417
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,970
Just a moment. I'll go
and buy some flowers.

418
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:48,972
Hurry up!

419
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,487
Hey, what are you doing!
Where are you going?

420
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,489
Stop! Idiots!

421
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,995
"I don't care if people
call me a ruffian."

422
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,007
Stop!

423
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,510
What luck! They are three
and we are also three.

424
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,014
The one in the
centre is mine.

425
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,016
Ganshu, hop over to the store
and pick up three cigarettes.

426
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,518
The girls will be
impressed with our style.

427
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,521
You have brains!

428
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,524
- Get filter cigarettes.
- All right.

429
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:48,020
- Ghode, fetch some mint, too.
- Why?

430
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:51,534
When you approach them,
your breath will smell fresh.

431
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,036
Go.

432
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,565
Please stop!

433
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,570
Please don't be angry.

434
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,572
I've missed my school bus and
I have to get to Sidney point.

435
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,074
If I don't reach there, there
could be a great problem.

436
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:49,081
- I am Devika.
- And I am Sanjaylal.

437
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,097
Yes.

438
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,625
Instead of your picnic, come
along to Malroad for a coffee.

439
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,137
Some other time, perhaps.

440
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,206
You mentioned something
about a coffee.

441
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,221
There's a boy who
is running like crazy.

442
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:01,223
- Is he calling to you?
- No.

443
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,727
Devika, listen to me.

444
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:14,703
Sanjay considers himself
to be very smart.

445
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,741
I shall take the money for
the cigarettes from him.

446
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,744
Why did you have to get off?

447
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,746
I couldn't help it.
He asked me to fetch mint.

448
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:25,247
Shut up!
Don't you have any brains?

449
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:26,749
What?!!

450
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,254
Greetings, sir!

451
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,256
Greetings... So you know me, eh?

452
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:39,751
Who doesn't know you, sir!
You are the lord of this village.

453
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:44,255
Oh, all right!
Do you have matches?

454
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:46,268
Offer the matches to the lady.

455
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:51,764
- How are your cattle?
- It is all your grace, sir.

456
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,777
I hear that the produce is
not very good this year.

457
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,281
There's been no rain and
we have no money and...

458
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,784
Oh! Keep this.

459
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,788
Share it.

460
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,791
- Thank you, sir.
- You are welcome.

461
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,292
Thank you, madam.

462
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,299
Enjoy yourself... At last
your wish has been granted.

463
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,300
Come along.

464
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:29,801
- Hey! Is my Mercedes ready?
- No, sir.

465
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,314
Oh, no!
Where is your father?

466
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,815
He has gone to the police
station to file a report.

467
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,820
A thief stole one of our cars.
It was similar to yours.

468
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,823
It is a green maruti gypsy.

469
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,326
What a state this
country has come to!

470
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:48,330
Devika, I hate thieves.

471
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,855
It's a small place but
the coffee is great.

472
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,870
Hey!
Come here.

473
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,377
Fetch 2 cups of
special coffee and...

474
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,388
- What happened? - There's
a problem with the chair.

475
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,393
Hey! Change your chairs.

476
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:55,398
- What did he want?
- He's placed a tall order.

477
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,399
- Who will pay for it?
- No one.

478
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:00,903
Have some.

479
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,908
These pastries
are really good.

480
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,911
Look!
It's those jerks again.

481
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,908
Greetings, sir!
Greetings, madam!

482
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,421
Hello!

483
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:24,917
- We were passing through...
- So we decided to pay you a visit.

484
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:28,431
We were famished and...
all our money was stolen.

485
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,433
Serve them too.

486
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,436
Thank you, sir. We won't
forget your favour.

487
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:35,937
Let's make ourselves at home.

488
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,942
Hey, waiter!
Give us 3 menu cards.

489
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:50,942
Did you really come for coffee
or to make someone jealous?

490
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,458
Do you know Shekhar?

491
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:01,954
Yes, and I also know that he'd
called you to Sidney point today

492
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,960
Yesterday, I overheard Shekhar
talking to his friends.

493
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,973
He mentioned that it
took him a while...

494
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,975
...to woo Kamla,
Bimla and Richa.

495
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,978
But Devika readily
dropped into his lap.

496
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,981
He's a liar!

497
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,980
Richa is from Queens College,
but who are Kamla and Bimla?

498
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:33,485
They were from Sitaram college.
They returned home.

499
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,495
Why?

500
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,502
- They were cheated.
- What happened?

501
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,006
- How can I tell you?
- Please tell me.

502
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:53,505
This is what
happened to them.

503
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:02,514
That must be it.

504
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,030
I hear that it's
Shekhar's old habit.

505
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:11,033
I'll teach him a lesson
that he'll never forget.

506
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:14,036
I'll seek revenge on him
for insulting me today.

507
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:15,538
How?

508
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,040
Will you assist me?

509
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:27,039
- Shall I contact you at
Xavier's? - Yes... No!

510
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,552
I share my name with a
couple of scoundrels.

511
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:33,555
- Then? - There's
another number... 202.

512
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,064
Add my bill to my account.

513
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,067
Thank you, sir... Madam!

514
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,070
Waiter, fetch us 3 menus.

515
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:56,067
- Get lost!
- I'll pay you Rs 100.

516
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,246
She's walking on air since
the time she met Shekhar.

517
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,790
She'll come to her senses
when she becomes like this.

518
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,423
Is Shekhar really
like that, dear?

519
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,135
Who is Sanju?

520
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,533
I have befriended Sanju,
to seek revenge on Shekhar.

521
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,133
I don't want a
romantic involvement.

522
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:32,671
- So, Sanju is a nobody?
- He is not a nobody.

523
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:36,617
Any boy who gives a tip
of Rs 200 for a match...

524
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:39,018
...is surely somebody.

525
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,816
- Rs 100! Who gave
it to you? - Sanju.

526
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,620
- And Sanju took it back.
- Hey, give it back!

527
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,024
This belongs to father and
I have to return it to him.

528
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:51,361
Hey! What would happen
if I told Devika the truth?

529
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,765
She would have left.

530
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,098
I didn't want to befriend her.
I wanted to seek revenge on...

531
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,831
Shekhar, which I have done.

532
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,323
- 2 plates of 'samosas'
please. - Yes, sir.

533
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,732
It's blank.

534
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,080
Dear Ratan.

535
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:05,005
Why didn't you return the chit
that fell from Kalpana's books?

536
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:10,711
- It bore your name.
- My name? Where is it?

537
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,210
- The letter will cost Rs 20.
- What!

538
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:19,718
- All right. Give me Rs 10.
- I won't give a single penny.

539
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,355
All right. I'm off.

540
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,361
Come here.

541
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,839
Take this Rs 10.
This is your Diwali gift.

542
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,842
...and I'm not
interested in the letter.

543
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,842
Take this...
Don't hesitate.

544
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,315
I told you that I
didn't want it.

545
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:51,045
Read it. It might contain
something special.

546
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,348
Get lost.

547
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,161
Dear Ratan.

548
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:07,259
I don't know what
has come over me.

549
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,597
Tonight is 'diwali'.

550
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:13,438
All the boys and girls will
be gathered at the courtyard.

551
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:18,446
If you come holding a
red rose in your hand...

552
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,914
...I will assume
that you love me too.

553
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,746
With love from Kalpana.

554
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:28,085
Nazima, come here.
Give Kalpana this letter...

555
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,125
...and tell her that
it is from Ratan. - Okay

556
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:34,695
Kalpana, this is from Ratan.

557
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:39,793
Dear Kalpana, I don't know
what has come over me.

558
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,463
I dream of you always.

559
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,073
Tonight you will surely
come to the courtyard.

560
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,804
And if you carry a red rose...

561
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,108
...I will assume that
you love me too.

562
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,011
With love from Ratan.

563
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,263
All the boys here are crazy
about the girls from Queens.

564
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,374
And those girls don't even
given them a second glance.

565
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:22,775
Even we ought to do the same.
All boys are the same.

566
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,006
If you express your feelings
they don't care about you.

567
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,675
And if you play hard to get,
they come after you.

568
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:32,016
- Is that so? - Yes, of course.
Try it and see.

569
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:33,680
Who is your mule?

570
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,125
- Whose did you steal?
- Shut up...

571
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:45,131
Take this... Hey, look yonder.

572
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,246
Let's tease him.

573
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,946
Hey! Why are you holding a
red rose? Let me see.

574
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,617
Let us see.

575
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,626
- What a deep red colour!
- It's a rose.

576
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,821
Hey, look there! Kalpana
is also holding a red rose.

577
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:16,988
Is something going on?

578
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,557
He has improved.

579
01:02:19,802 --> 01:02:23,431
I'll call Anjali over, surely
Kalpana will accompany her.

580
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,698
- Don't you want to speak to her?
- I don't want to speak to anyone.

581
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:28,037
Hang on!
It will be fun.

582
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,911
- Anjali, come here!
- Refuse.

583
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:39,888
- Tell him to get lost.
- Get lost!

584
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,191
Acting smart, eh?
Come here!

585
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:55,197
Hold your ground.
You come here, you pigeon.

586
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,064
Hey, why can't you listen?

587
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:28,960
"Those who are crazy after
the girls of this city."

588
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:44,286
"What can they know
about our elegance."

589
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,555
"You disloyal sweetheart."

590
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:58,992
"The one who
doesn't realize..."

591
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:03,300
"...Who I'm crazy about."

592
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,305
"What can she
understand about."

593
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:11,005
"...the style of
my amorousness."

594
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,110
"Understand me my love."

595
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:36,961
"There may be many beauties,
but we are no less."

596
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,837
"Have a proper look at us."

597
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:44,778
"Don't be so boastful
it can be that..."

598
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:48,544
"...ultimately you might
land up no where."

599
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:10,761
"Those who are crazy after
the girls of the city."

600
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:38,297
"- Come here.
- No no."

601
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,427
"Come here into my arms,
...don't go away."

602
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,441
"No... no."

603
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:10,464
"Many people
have gone crazy."

604
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,866
"Where can you
escape too."

605
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:18,129
"Hearing my plea...
with all style."

606
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:21,938
"Will come running
towards me."

607
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:40,953
"The one who
doesn't realize."

608
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,966
"Whom I'm crazy about."

609
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:02,742
"Those who are crazy after
the girls of this city."

610
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:20,702
"My disloyal sweetheart."

611
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:24,035
"Try and understand
sweetheart."

612
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:37,879
Tonight, Sanju sat beside me
long after everyone had left.

613
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:40,778
He seemed as though he
wanted to say something.

614
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:46,021
I thought I'd say it myself
that you are everything to me.

615
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,368
Numskull, how can
I explain to you?

616
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:08,244
Devika, please listen I have
nothing to do with Richa.

617
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:11,184
Infact, I was fooling her.

618
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,187
Like Kamla and Bimla?

619
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,917
Anyway, why did you call?

620
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,260
Devika, I'd like to meet
you alone some place.

621
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,798
- Like Kamla and Bimla?
- What!

622
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:27,060
Never mind that! I'm
coming to Malroad today.

623
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,261
- Where exactly?
- Ahead of Malroad there...

624
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:34,105
...is a road going uphill.
A tree bearing yellow flowers.

625
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:38,939
Wait for me at 5 p. M.
Beneath that tree.

626
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,614
Who are you calling now?

627
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:02,131
- Who is Sanjay?
- Hey! Give it to me.

628
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,311
- Yes, Devika. Go on.
- I have an appointment...

629
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,314
...with Shekhar at 5 this
evening. Could you come...

630
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,316
...to Malroad at 4 p. M?

631
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,818
You will have to come
there with some supplies.

632
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,320
Sure.

633
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:25,890
A long rope... 2 buckets.

634
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:28,293
And... what!

635
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:34,335
All right, I'll be there.

636
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,347
- What are you looking at?
- The necklace in the centre.

637
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,078
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

638
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,754
- It costs Rs 4000.
- So? I'll get it for you.

639
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,687
Why are you
sweet talking me?

640
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,689
Mr Thapar's car
is at your garage.

641
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,693
And I have to return it today.

642
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,423
I could take it to him and get
it back under some pretext.

643
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,129
And then we could go for
a drive in the evening.

644
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,134
Good idea.
But...

645
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,469
...what will we do if
Thapar keeps the car?

646
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,203
Wait and see.
I'll get around him.

647
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:35,791
- Add the fresh one too.
- All right. Here.

648
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:20,775
My stomach is hurting.

649
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:25,007
Shekhar, why have
you brought us along?

650
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:29,774
I'll look like a fool if I
stand alone beneath this tree.

651
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:32,013
Oh! So you want all of
us to look like fools, eh?

652
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:33,611
As you wish.

653
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,135
- Well?
- What?

654
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,976
- Take him somewhere.
- This fellow.

655
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,816
Go and obtain some relief.

656
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,517
There's someone with her.

657
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:37,575
I won't spare him.

658
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,155
Why are you hitting me?
Help!

659
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,264
We missed him!

660
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,835
- Where have you brought me?
- This is my house.

661
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:14,839
Is this your house?

662
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,376
I'll go and tell father
that I'm going out.

663
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:32,252
Sir, I have brought your
car from Girdhari Garage.

664
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,261
Give the keys and leave.

665
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:39,931
The engine is knocking. Shall
I take it back and repair it?

666
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:42,935
You bring back the car after 10
days and it's still not ready!

667
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,803
Commissioner, the
locals are thieves.

668
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:51,812
When they take the car to
the garage they keep it.

669
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,399
I know how to deal
with the likes of you.

670
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,469
Sandeep, take the keys
from him and throw him out.

671
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:17,505
Give the keys.

672
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,347
Sanjay, your house
is very impressive.

673
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,421
Was your father angry?

674
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,858
He was angry because I
was late for the party.

675
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:44,061
I tossed the car keys in anger,
I'll have to drop you in taxi.

676
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,233
Your father appears to
be very hot tempered.

677
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:59,113
So am I. Someday, I shall leave
this house and his wealth.

678
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:09,651
Devika, if I didn't have
any of this wealth...

679
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:14,788
...would you...

680
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:18,989
- What?
- Nothing.

681
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:22,135
Sanjay, I know what
you're trying to say.

682
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:27,471
- Would you believe me if I
told you something? - Go ahead.

683
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:33,472
Sanjay, when I first met you,
I didn't know who you were.

684
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:38,476
But it seemed as though I
had been waiting for you.

685
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:43,223
It is the truth, Sanjay.
I do not care for money.

686
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,486
Even if you don't have
anything in the future...

687
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,154
...you'll mean
the same to me.

688
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,937
This is my memento.
You might forget me...

689
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,476
...in the future, but I
shall never forget you.

690
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,611
I will have to solder it. It
will take 5 to 10 minutes.

691
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,748
- All right.
- I'll be back soon.

692
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:25,657
Give it to me.

693
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:34,674
- What happened? - I'm on fire.
The flame of love.

694
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:40,941
Why are you
being so dramatic?

695
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,326
- Is it gold?
- Yes.

696
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:56,887
Someone has given it to
me with trembling hands...

697
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,695
...and a throbbing heart.

698
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:04,068
- Who? - Devika.
- Never!!

699
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:08,838
Big brother, you are
the heavy muscular type.

700
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,970
A heavy model like you,
wouldn't understand love.

701
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:20,082
Stop your nonsense
and tell me this.

702
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:23,420
- Have you told her anything.
- No. Not as yet.

703
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,518
Therein lies the problem.
It's difficult to say anything.

704
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,393
It is not difficult. All you
need to do is take a decision.

705
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,397
- Have you come to a decision.
- Yes, of course.

706
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:36,401
- What will you say?
- What is there to say?

707
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,743
I'll hold her hand like this,
look into her eyes and say...

708
01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:48,281
- Ganshu, Ghode,
listen to me. - Not now.

709
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:51,281
- It's something special.
- My father will kick my butt.

710
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:56,290
I've soldered it, but is it
okay if I fix it tomorrow?

711
01:19:56,358 --> 01:20:00,021
All right, I'll come
for it tomorrow.

712
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:08,763
- Hi Anjali, I was on my
way to see you. - Really!

713
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:12,295
- Let's sit here.
- Anjali, come home soon.

714
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:13,841
Yes, father.

715
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,170
Ah, yes! I couldn't
bring the car back.

716
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,348
Thapar made mince
meat of me.

717
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,143
I knew that.

718
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,216
Anjali, I want to
tell you something.

719
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,756
- It's something special.
- Go on.

720
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,997
I don't know how to say it.
You might wonder...

721
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,867
...at the sudden
change in Sanju.

722
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,203
You won't laugh
at me, will you?

723
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:56,549
The fact is...

724
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,122
- Anjali, serve dinner.
- I'll be there.

725
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:11,131
Go on, Sanju.

726
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,092
No, not right now. We'll go
and speak in privacy tomorrow.

727
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:25,107
"Whether you say it or not
but I have already heard it."

728
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:32,116
"You have chosen me as
your soul mate in love."

729
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:37,625
"You have chosen and I
have already heard it,"

730
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:08,649
"the First euphoria
and the ecstasy."

731
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,751
"The love is afresh,
and so is the await."

732
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:21,392
"What should I do oh
my love lorn heart."

733
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:26,532
"Oh my love lorn heart
you only tell me."

734
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,533
"I'm flying high in
these euphoric winds."

735
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:06,547
"Or should I swing
with these clouds."

736
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:26,897
"Or should I get the sky
and the earth together."

737
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,731
"Tell me friends what to
do and what not to do."

738
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:39,245
"The first euphoria
and the ecstasy."

739
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:31,162
"He spoke to me in
such a manner that..."

740
01:24:31,232 --> 01:24:37,000
"...he gave me the
colourfull dreams of love."

741
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:58,023
"As is I remain helpless."

742
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:03,388
"And he kisses me
with all his love."

743
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:10,036
"The first euphoria
and the ecstasy."

744
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:15,737
"The love is afresh
and so is the await."

745
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:45,635
Keep this as my memento.
You might forget me...

746
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,834
...in the future, but I
shall never forget you.

747
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,077
- Sanju.
- Yes, father.

748
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:57,318
- Deposit this Rs. 5000 in
the bank. - Yes, father.

749
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,916
What are you
looking at, Anjali?

750
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,087
- There was a lovely pearl
necklace here. - It is sold.

751
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,961
Ramlal's son Sanjay
bought it this morning.

752
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,728
- Do you wanting anything
else? - No, thank you.

753
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:17,635
- What happened?
- Sanju is crazy.

754
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,639
There was a necklace here.
I said that...

755
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,141
...I liked it so he
got it for me.

756
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:25,076
- So, what? - No,
it is very expensive.

757
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,579
And I don't want such
an expensive gift.

758
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:29,014
I'll get hold of Sanju
and have it returned.

759
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:32,245
Ratan, have you
seen Sanju?

760
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,083
I saw him heading
for sunset point.

761
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:10,450
Sanju, wake up!

762
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:14,454
- We have to go for practice.
- Let go off me! - Get up!

763
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:18,083
- Oh, all right.
- Come quickly.

764
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:39,213
Where are the rest?

765
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,275
Sanju is here too!

766
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,816
If he comes once, he takes
a break for several days.

767
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,323
- Have you taken the full round
today? - One hour 10 minutes.

768
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:58,058
If this was the race,
I would have won it.

769
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:04,061
You would have won it last year.
But, Shekhar forged ahead

770
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:07,505
It is the last few seconds that
decide the defeat and victory.

771
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:11,170
Whatever it may be,
everyone believes that...

772
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:14,976
...only you can defeat
Shekhar... It's true.

773
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,645
So much hope can make
a person nervous.

774
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:25,087
Especially father.
He keeps dreaming of...

775
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,956
...my victory and
Shekhar's defeat.

776
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:30,961
He wants to buy an
Italian cycle for me.

777
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:34,092
- It costs Rs. 20, 000.
- 20, 000!

778
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:44,105
I fear that if I don't win
father will heartbroken.

779
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:13,133
This training is very good.
We ought to take it too.

780
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:16,903
Okay! With such training,
you'll surely beat Shekhar.

781
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,538
We have seen nothing.
You may continue.

782
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,256
Sanju meets me very
rarely these days.

783
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,451
Perhaps he only remembers
me when he needs a car.

784
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,588
It hurts me, Sanju.
But I can still...

785
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:41,363
...do anything for you.
Don't ever forget me, Sanju.

786
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,391
Who is accompanying her?

787
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,322
What is she doing
with a boy from Model?

788
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,339
Do you know Devika?

789
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:31,347
She is from Queens College
and is of our class.

790
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:35,947
How dare a stupid localite of
Model College, befriend her?

791
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:41,725
- Are you Devika's father?
- M ind your language, bastard!

792
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:49,668
And I am not a bastard
but you are.

793
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:58,679
Come on, jerk!

794
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:41,045
What happened?

795
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,647
Sir, he is attempting to
ruin a respectable girl.

796
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:46,420
Which girl?

797
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:48,359
She is from Queens College
and she is my family friend.

798
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:51,123
- What nonsense!
- Shut up! - Get lost!

799
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:01,138
You are standing
upright now.

800
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:07,680
Let my boys
break your ribs.

801
01:33:07,748 --> 01:33:09,477
Do you understand?

802
01:33:17,858 --> 01:33:21,487
- What happened, Sanju?
- Quiet! You're spoiling him.

803
01:33:21,562 --> 01:33:22,756
He must have
started the fight.

804
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:26,093
Don't interfere in my matters.
I don't need your sermon.

805
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:36,100
I'm glad to have found you.

806
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,111
I have something
important to discuss.

807
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,578
Let's go sit somewhere.

808
01:33:39,647 --> 01:33:41,581
Not now as I have to
go for rehearsals.

809
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:44,379
Next Sunday there's
a dance competition.

810
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,647
...in which we're participating
with Rajput College.

811
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:48,120
Shekhar is also participating.

812
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:52,852
Right now, I want to
tell you about myself.

813
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,866
Devika, hurry up.
The bus is leaving.

814
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,868
I'm off now, we'll meet
at the dance competition.

815
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,205
- You are in the Xavier's
team, aren't you? - Yes.

816
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:12,207
At the Inter School
Dance Competition...

817
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:14,213
...after St. Peter's College,

818
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:18,081
...is Xavier's College
at number four.

819
01:34:41,909 --> 01:34:45,640
"We are crazy for love,
we are love lorn."

820
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:48,477
"Our songs are
full of youth."

821
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:53,316
"Because of us
is this world."

822
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:18,811
"Where ever you see in
the darkness of the night."

823
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,814
"Or you search in
the morning light."

824
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:33,960
"We all are seen, no
one can be are equal."

825
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:41,729
"The world is
because of us."

826
01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:54,071
Let's see how many points
the judges have given them.

827
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:57,743
After the spectacular
performance by Xavier's...

828
01:35:57,818 --> 01:36:01,083
...the next college is Model.

829
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:09,094
Xavier's performed
well, didn't they?

830
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:11,696
Now, it is Model's turn.

831
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:55,464
"You are young, my friends.
Come on, don't feel depressed."

832
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:59,468
"Look at me!"

833
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:10,990
"Agreed that I have
no money now...

834
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,992
"...but that won't
be forever."

835
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,994
"Even my fate will
shine one day."

836
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:22,992
"Believe me, my friends."

837
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:13,543
"Manage with whatever you
earn through hard work."

838
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:17,557
"Don't eye what
others have."

839
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:21,561
"Fate will smile
on us too one day."

840
01:38:22,096 --> 01:38:25,554
"The world will
envy us too."

841
01:38:25,633 --> 01:38:27,567
"Agreed that I have
no money now...

842
01:38:27,635 --> 01:38:30,069
"...but that won't be forever."

843
01:38:30,137 --> 01:38:32,071
"Even my fate will
shine one day."

844
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:40,069
"Believe me,
my friends."

845
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:21,621
I have won a lottery!

846
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:02,560
"You are young, my friends.
Come on, don't feel depressed."

847
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:06,655
"Look at me!"

848
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:09,669
"Agreed that I have
no money now...

849
01:40:09,737 --> 01:40:11,671
"...but that won't be forever."

850
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:14,674
"Even my fate will
shine one day."

851
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:21,170
"Believe me, my friends."

852
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:27,186
That was Model College.

853
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:30,189
I can hardly believe
that Model college...

854
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:32,191
...could give such
a lovely performance.

855
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:37,697
Now, it's our turn.

856
01:40:51,245 --> 01:40:54,703
I believe, the judges are taking
some time to give the points.

857
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:58,718
And now for last
year's winning teams...

858
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:01,721
...Queens College
and Rajput College.

859
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:48,257
"My name is Fonseca."
You don't know me, baby."

860
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:57,767
"You cannot escape me, you
will have to come to me."

861
01:41:58,312 --> 01:42:02,772
"My name is Monica. I won't be
intimidated by your threats."

862
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:07,287
"I will go where I please."

863
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:21,791
"I own a car
and a bungalow."

864
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:26,796
"Moreover, I will
even love you."

865
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:40,809
"All your big talks
are a sham."

866
01:42:41,355 --> 01:42:45,815
"Your boots are borrowed,
your suit is hired."

867
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:51,821
"My name is Fonseca.
You don't know me, baby.

868
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:56,336
"You cannot escape me,
you will have to come to me."

869
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:35,364
"Sorry O dear, I did
not understand you."

870
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:39,879
"You are just the
right guy to marry."

871
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:53,883
"My dreams will all
come true now."

872
01:43:54,428 --> 01:43:58,888
"We give a damn for
those who envy us."

873
01:43:59,933 --> 01:44:04,893
"My name is Fonseca.
You don't know me, baby."

874
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:13,903
"You cannot escape me,
you will have to come to me."

875
01:44:49,483 --> 01:44:52,941
Last year's winning teams,
Rajput and Queens college.

876
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:57,947
All the colleges have performed
well in today's competition.

877
01:44:58,492 --> 01:45:00,460
The judges decision
is before me.

878
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:03,462
Let's see who
are the winners.

879
01:45:31,558 --> 01:45:32,490
Yes, sir.

880
01:45:43,537 --> 01:45:45,505
I'm sorry that I couldn't
meet you after the dance.

881
01:45:46,039 --> 01:45:48,507
Even if we had met, I would
have said the same thing.

882
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:51,510
You're absolutely
wonderful, Sanjay.

883
01:45:53,547 --> 01:45:57,005
I didn't know that
you were so great.

884
01:45:57,084 --> 01:46:00,520
You ought to get the first
prize for what you did.

885
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:04,023
I worked very hard...

886
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:06,525
...but I must have lacked
something to have missed it.

887
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:10,029
You didn't understand.
Anyway, forget it.

888
01:46:10,097 --> 01:46:12,531
I'll be there at Malroadat
approximately 8 O'clock.

889
01:46:12,599 --> 01:46:14,533
All right, I'll see
you at eight.

890
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:23,042
- Where are you coming from?
- The doctor's clinic.

891
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:25,044
- Why?
- I've got fever.

892
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:28,548
You ought to rest.
Why are you loitering around?

893
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:30,048
I'm on my way home.

894
01:46:31,585 --> 01:46:34,053
Anjali, could I get a
car from your garage?

895
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,057
Where do you have to go?

896
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:42,050
Devika's coming to meet me today
and I'll have to drop her back.

897
01:46:42,596 --> 01:46:45,064
- You can take it.
- Thank you!

898
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:50,559
Oh Anjali, sometimes I feel
as though I am in a dream.

899
01:46:51,605 --> 01:46:55,564
Frankly, I'd never contemplated
that a rich girl like Devika...

900
01:46:55,642 --> 01:46:57,075
...would fall in love with me.

901
01:46:57,144 --> 01:46:59,578
- Sanju, may I say something?
- Sure.

902
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:02,080
Are you sure that
Devika really loves you?

903
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:05,084
I mean, some girls
mistake their feelings.

904
01:47:05,152 --> 01:47:08,087
No, Anjali. It is not a case
of mistaken feelings.

905
01:47:08,155 --> 01:47:10,589
Have you told her
all about yourself?

906
01:47:10,657 --> 01:47:12,090
You mean, the fact
that I'm from Model?

907
01:47:12,626 --> 01:47:15,094
She realised that on the day
of the dance competition.

908
01:47:15,162 --> 01:47:17,596
And she is aware that no
wealthy boy studies at Model.

909
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:20,098
That is why she lost her
pallor when she saw you.

910
01:47:20,167 --> 01:47:21,099
What!

911
01:47:21,168 --> 01:47:24,103
The moment she realised you were
from Model and not Xavier's...

912
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:27,607
What nonsense! If that was the
case, why would she call me?

913
01:47:27,674 --> 01:47:30,108
Why would she praise my dance
and come to meet me today?

914
01:47:30,644 --> 01:47:32,612
All girls are not the same.

915
01:47:32,679 --> 01:47:34,112
Devika is not a gold digger.

916
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:37,116
She likes me.
She loves Sanju.

917
01:47:37,184 --> 01:47:40,119
Don't be naive, Sanju.
She doesn't love you.

918
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:41,620
Why are you talking nonsense?

919
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:44,623
Instead of being happy for me,
you're trying to create doubts.

920
01:47:44,691 --> 01:47:46,124
I'm not creating doubts.

921
01:47:46,193 --> 01:47:48,627
I'm trying to prevent you
from making a mistake.

922
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:53,121
I don't want you
to be deeply hurt.

923
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:57,125
Anjali, I don't like this
pointless talk from you.

924
01:47:57,204 --> 01:48:01,140
If you don't approve the truth,
I'll never speak to you again.

925
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:02,641
I won't meet you either.

926
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,147
Neither do I want
to see you again.

927
01:48:10,183 --> 01:48:13,641
Sanju, you shouldn't speak
to Anjali in this manner.

928
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,154
Why? What was wrong
with my statement?

929
01:48:16,223 --> 01:48:18,657
Let it be.
Bye, Sanju.

930
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:21,661
It seems as though everyone
has gone crazy today.

931
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:33,161
Shakur, I'm going out and
I'll be back in a short while.

932
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,176
Hey! Who will serve at the
tables? Don't go anywhere.

933
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:52,191
Hey, waiter!

934
01:49:08,742 --> 01:49:10,209
What will you have, Devika?

935
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:15,715
- What do you get here? - Nothing
special, it's a lousy cafe.

936
01:49:16,750 --> 01:49:19,218
Now that we're here,
let's have some coffee...

937
01:49:19,286 --> 01:49:21,720
...or the poor chap
will lose his tip.

938
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:26,225
Fetch us 2 cups of coffee.

939
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:28,727
And make sure that the
cups are washed and clean.

940
01:49:34,768 --> 01:49:36,736
Chotu, give me
2 cups of coffee.

941
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:40,740
Did you see that? He
doesn't seem to be ashamed.

942
01:49:40,807 --> 01:49:43,742
He is a perfect example of
a jerk from Model School.

943
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:59,247
- Is this Thapar's son?
- That's what he told me.

944
01:50:01,795 --> 01:50:04,764
Why would Thapar's
son be at this joint?

945
01:50:04,831 --> 01:50:07,766
Perhaps his father
threw him out...

946
01:50:07,834 --> 01:50:10,769
...and so he has to
work at this lousy cafe.

947
01:50:14,808 --> 01:50:17,777
Hey! There's no need
to stand around.

948
01:50:17,844 --> 01:50:20,278
Fetch the bill when we
have finished our coffee.

949
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:22,281
You'll get paid for the coffee
as well as receive a tip.

950
01:50:22,349 --> 01:50:23,281
Get lost!

951
01:50:31,825 --> 01:50:33,292
Thapar's son!

952
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:23,843
You said that money
didn't matter to you.

953
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:25,844
You said that it
wouldn't matter...

954
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:27,846
...if I didn't have
anything in the future.

955
01:51:29,382 --> 01:51:30,849
So it was a lie.

956
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:35,854
A person who has started
out with a lie...

957
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:38,857
...has no right to
call anyone else a liar.

958
01:51:39,392 --> 01:51:40,859
I admit that I lied.

959
01:51:41,394 --> 01:51:44,852
But I did it only to
disguise my poverty.

960
01:51:44,931 --> 01:51:46,865
And you lied to
disguise your deceit.

961
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:49,868
Until yesterday I was Thapar's
son, so you approved of me.

962
01:51:49,936 --> 01:51:53,372
And now that I am an ordinary
man's son, I disgust you.

963
01:51:53,907 --> 01:51:55,875
That's because you
want a rich boyfriend.

964
01:51:55,942 --> 01:51:59,378
If not Thapar's son, Malhotra's
son Shekhar will do...

965
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:01,880
...regardless of his bad
character. Isn't that right?

966
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:03,381
Yes, that's it.

967
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,908
- What is the matter, Devika?
- Nothing.

968
01:52:33,446 --> 01:52:36,904
Hey Jerk, I've left you
Rs 10 at your cafe.

969
01:52:36,983 --> 01:52:38,917
Take it from your
champion brother.

970
01:52:47,961 --> 01:52:49,929
Why are you hiding
your face now?

971
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:52,931
She wouldn't even
care to spit on it.

972
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:55,433
Keep within the limits of your
status and you'll be happy.

973
01:52:55,969 --> 01:52:57,436
Go and take
the 10 rupees.

974
01:53:15,488 --> 01:53:17,956
Beat him!
Don't spare him!

975
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:24,463
Pick him up.

976
01:53:28,501 --> 01:53:29,968
You woo a girl, eh?

977
01:53:30,503 --> 01:53:31,970
You're Model's hero, eh?

978
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:40,968
You stupid localite! How dare
you woo a girl from Queens?

979
01:53:43,516 --> 01:53:44,983
You've become too
big for your boots.

980
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:47,986
Didn't I tell you that I did not
want any tricks from you?

981
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:52,491
Bastard!

982
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:01,489
Don't spare him!
Break his bones!

983
01:54:02,535 --> 01:54:04,002
Will you approach
a girl again?

984
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:07,005
What do you think of yourself,
you stupid localite.

985
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:10,068
Release him carefully.

986
01:55:31,624 --> 01:55:32,591
Get lost!

987
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:37,596
Both of you go home.

988
01:55:38,631 --> 01:55:39,598
Come along!

989
01:55:41,634 --> 01:55:44,102
I've warned you not to
interfere with these boys.

990
01:55:45,138 --> 01:55:48,107
You're still on
Devika's case.

991
01:55:48,641 --> 01:55:51,610
Mark my words, this fight
will blow out of proportion.

992
01:55:52,145 --> 01:55:55,603
And, if I hadn't arrived, they
would have broken all your bones.

993
01:55:55,682 --> 01:55:58,116
Hey! I could have
handled them alone.

994
01:55:58,184 --> 01:56:01,620
Who asked you to interfere? Don't
pretend to be a great saviour.

995
01:56:01,688 --> 01:56:04,623
Oh! So you're very strong, eh?
Come on.

996
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:07,626
Ratan, I warn you.
Don't challenge me.

997
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:09,628
- Are you afraid?
- Hey!

998
01:56:31,684 --> 01:56:34,653
I gave you Rs 5000 to
deposit at the bank...

999
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:36,154
...but this shows
only Rs 1000.

1000
01:56:36,222 --> 01:56:38,156
Father, you didn't
give me any money.

1001
01:56:38,691 --> 01:56:40,158
Ah yes!
I had given it to Sanju.

1002
01:56:44,697 --> 01:56:51,660
Sanju, I... What's this?
You've fought again!

1003
01:56:54,707 --> 01:56:58,165
I gave you Rs 5000 to
deposit at the bank.

1004
01:56:58,244 --> 01:57:00,178
But this shows
only Rs 1000.

1005
01:57:02,215 --> 01:57:06,174
How much did you deposit?
Why don't you answer?

1006
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,687
Rs 1000.

1007
01:57:09,222 --> 01:57:12,191
1000? What about the
remaining Rs 4000?

1008
01:57:13,726 --> 01:57:15,193
I spent it.

1009
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:21,189
Spent it! What did you spend
on? Why don't you tell me?

1010
01:57:22,735 --> 01:57:26,694
It wasn't a paltry sum that you
spent with no explanations!

1011
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,207
Did you gamble?

1012
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:33,200
Where is the Rs 4000?
Tell me!

1013
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:37,705
I can't tell you, but I
will return the money.

1014
01:57:39,752 --> 01:57:44,712
I'm working day and night in
order to buy a cycle for Ratan.

1015
01:57:44,791 --> 01:57:47,225
And you blow it up
without a second thought.

1016
01:57:47,293 --> 01:57:48,726
Get out!

1017
01:57:49,262 --> 01:57:54,723
Get out! And don't
you dare to return!

1018
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:03,792
Father, there's no need to go
to Delhi to buy a new cycle.

1019
01:59:03,870 --> 01:59:05,303
It will be an
unnecessary expense.

1020
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:06,804
Besides, my old cycle
will suffice.

1021
01:59:07,340 --> 01:59:08,807
Don't worry about it.

1022
01:59:09,842 --> 01:59:13,300
- I'll be back by 11 p. M.
- All right, father.

1023
01:59:15,848 --> 01:59:19,807
Father, please forgive Sanju.

1024
01:59:19,886 --> 01:59:23,322
I'll reason with him.
It won't happen again.

1025
01:59:23,389 --> 01:59:24,822
Allow him to come home.

1026
01:59:29,862 --> 01:59:30,829
Let's go.

1027
01:59:55,888 --> 01:59:59,847
Sanju, father has gone to Delhi
and he will return at 11 p. M.

1028
02:00:01,394 --> 02:00:04,363
I apologised on your behalf
and he has forgiven you.

1029
02:00:04,430 --> 02:00:05,863
Come home now.

1030
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:12,860
I know that you're angry with
me. I shouldn't have hit you.

1031
02:00:12,939 --> 02:00:16,375
Next time, I will ignore the fact
that you are my older brother.

1032
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:20,379
And I don't need your pity.
Here's your blanket.

1033
02:00:20,913 --> 02:00:24,371
It wasn't me, but Anjali, who
covered you with this blanket.

1034
02:00:26,919 --> 02:00:28,386
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1035
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:17,424
Yesterday, your fighter
and you were lucky...

1036
02:01:17,503 --> 02:01:19,437
...because I wasn't present.

1037
02:01:19,972 --> 02:01:21,439
What will you do today?

1038
02:01:21,507 --> 02:01:24,442
I'll give you the same treatment
that I gave your friends.

1039
02:01:29,982 --> 02:01:32,951
You will have to be
taught a lesson.

1040
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:39,457
Let's see who teaches
whom a lesson?

1041
02:03:08,581 --> 02:03:11,550
- Ratan's met with an accident.
- What! How did it happen?

1042
02:03:11,617 --> 02:03:13,050
I don't know...

1043
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:15,553
...but it seems that he fell
off the cliff with his cycle.

1044
02:03:15,621 --> 02:03:18,556
He has been taken to the
Government hospital... Hurry!

1045
02:03:32,104 --> 02:03:34,572
Doctor, I am Ratan's
younger brother.

1046
02:03:35,107 --> 02:03:37,575
What was... How is he?
What has happened to him?

1047
02:03:37,643 --> 02:03:39,577
- Where is your father?
- He has gone to Delhi.

1048
02:03:39,645 --> 02:03:41,078
- When will he return?
- Tonight.

1049
02:03:41,147 --> 02:03:42,580
Bring him along as
soon as he returns.

1050
02:03:42,648 --> 02:03:44,582
But, doctor... What's
happened to him?

1051
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:48,086
The operation is badly needed.
I don't have the time to spare.

1052
02:04:08,641 --> 02:04:11,610
No one can
defeat Ratan now.

1053
02:04:16,148 --> 02:04:17,615
Call Ratan.

1054
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:27,625
- Father...
- What is the matter?

1055
02:04:31,163 --> 02:04:34,132
I have forgiven you...

1056
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:36,134
...but don't repeat
this mistake again.

1057
02:04:36,202 --> 02:04:39,638
Go... Go and fetch Ratan.

1058
02:04:40,172 --> 02:04:43,630
Ratan has met with an accident.
He is in the hospital.

1059
02:05:06,699 --> 02:05:08,166
The state in which
he was brought...

1060
02:05:08,234 --> 02:05:09,667
...required an
emergency operation.

1061
02:05:12,204 --> 02:05:14,672
He's still in coma.

1062
02:05:20,212 --> 02:05:22,180
I do not wish to
raise false hopes.

1063
02:05:24,216 --> 02:05:25,683
His condition
is very critical.

1064
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:53,271
Be brave.

1065
02:06:55,307 --> 02:06:56,274
Yes.

1066
02:06:59,311 --> 02:07:01,779
Last night,
I fought with Ratan.

1067
02:07:02,314 --> 02:07:08,275
This morning he came to pacify
me, but I didn't respond.

1068
02:07:09,321 --> 02:07:10,788
If anything happens to him...

1069
02:07:17,329 --> 02:07:18,796
What will happen now?

1070
02:07:20,332 --> 02:07:26,293
How will father survive?
He means everything to father.

1071
02:07:27,339 --> 02:07:29,807
He... and you too.

1072
02:08:25,397 --> 02:08:32,360
"If ever you got annoyed
with me and went away..."

1073
02:08:40,412 --> 02:08:47,875
"...I had never expected
to miss you so much."

1074
02:09:30,963 --> 02:09:37,425
"I could never walk even
two steps without you."

1075
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:44,932
"Yet in my innocence,
I always thought...

1076
02:09:46,478 --> 02:09:53,441
"...you will never leave me."

1077
02:10:01,493 --> 02:10:08,956
"I had never expected
to miss you so much."

1078
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:06,013
"If ever you got annoyed
with me and went away...

1079
02:11:25,577 --> 02:11:28,546
Ratan has regained
consciousness.

1080
02:11:28,614 --> 02:11:32,550
I'm returning from the hospital.
He's fine. He even spoke to me.

1081
02:11:32,618 --> 02:11:36,054
The Lord has
answered our prayers!

1082
02:12:09,121 --> 02:12:11,089
What if he tells the police?

1083
02:12:11,623 --> 02:12:15,081
I warned you to tell the
principal, but you...

1084
02:12:16,628 --> 02:12:18,596
It would have been
better if he had died.

1085
02:12:24,636 --> 02:12:29,596
- Water...
- I'll get it.

1086
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:54,121
If you tell anything to anyone,
the consequences won't be good.

1087
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:11,638
What was he
doing here, so late?

1088
02:13:12,684 --> 02:13:13,651
Tell me.

1089
02:13:15,687 --> 02:13:19,646
You are keeping something
from me. What is the matter?

1090
02:13:21,693 --> 02:13:24,161
- Tell me.
- I'll tell you.

1091
02:13:27,699 --> 02:13:31,658
Sanju, do you think that
I'll be alright for the race?

1092
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:35,172
Drink your medicine.

1093
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:40,678
The race will take place
on the 24th of next month.

1094
02:13:41,713 --> 02:13:46,173
Even if I get a week's
practice, it will suffice.

1095
02:13:46,718 --> 02:13:48,686
Isn't that right?

1096
02:13:50,222 --> 02:13:53,191
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1097
02:13:54,726 --> 02:13:56,193
There's still a month
and a half left.

1098
02:13:56,261 --> 02:13:59,196
Yes, there's a month
and a half left.

1099
02:14:00,732 --> 02:14:02,199
This time, I will defeat him.

1100
02:14:03,735 --> 02:14:08,195
Sanju, I will surely
defeat him this time.

1101
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:11,208
I won't spare him.

1102
02:14:14,746 --> 02:14:16,213
I'll defeat him.

1103
02:14:25,257 --> 02:14:28,226
Come along, Sanju.
Hurry up, Ghode, let's go.

1104
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:40,237
Shall we go?

1105
02:14:43,775 --> 02:14:46,243
Anjali, I will participate
in the cycle race this year.

1106
02:14:46,311 --> 02:14:50,247
- What! Are you serious?
- Yes.

1107
02:14:50,782 --> 02:14:53,250
I might not be able to
take Ratan's place...

1108
02:14:53,785 --> 02:14:57,243
...but it's the least
I can do for father.

1109
02:14:57,789 --> 02:15:02,249
Do your best, Sanju.
I'm with you all the way.

1110
02:15:54,846 --> 02:15:58,304
Idiot, you are taking advantage
of her feelings for you!

1111
02:16:44,896 --> 02:16:46,363
What is the matter?

1112
02:16:51,903 --> 02:16:53,871
Anjali, you might
consider it strange...

1113
02:16:54,906 --> 02:16:57,875
...but I'd like to tell you
what I have been feeling...

1114
02:16:57,943 --> 02:16:59,376
...these last few days.

1115
02:16:59,911 --> 02:17:00,878
What?

1116
02:17:01,913 --> 02:17:04,381
I have always considered
you as my closest friend.

1117
02:17:07,919 --> 02:17:10,387
But... I have grown
to love you now.

1118
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:50,427
You'll be perfectly alright
in another 3 or 4 weeks.

1119
02:17:50,962 --> 02:17:53,430
Until then, take care that you
don't put too much weight...

1120
02:17:53,498 --> 02:17:54,931
...on this leg.

1121
02:18:02,974 --> 02:18:04,441
Don't be dejected.

1122
02:18:05,977 --> 02:18:07,444
It is destiny.

1123
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:11,448
It doesn't matter that you can't
take part in the race tomorrow.

1124
02:18:12,984 --> 02:18:16,943
Without you, Shekhar's victory
will be meaningless anyway.

1125
02:18:31,002 --> 02:18:33,971
It is Ratan's cycle. Only a
little work remains to be done.

1126
02:18:34,506 --> 02:18:36,474
Tomorrow is the race...

1127
02:18:36,541 --> 02:18:38,975
...and Sanju wants to use
this cycle for the race.

1128
02:18:45,016 --> 02:18:46,483
What is the matter, Kalpana?

1129
02:18:48,019 --> 02:18:51,477
Aren't you aware
of Ratan's grief?

1130
02:18:54,025 --> 02:18:57,984
He had worked very hard to
participate in this race.

1131
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:01,988
And now...
He is not in this race.

1132
02:19:04,035 --> 02:19:07,493
And Sanju is responsible
for all of it.

1133
02:19:07,572 --> 02:19:09,005
- Sanju!
- Yes.

1134
02:19:09,074 --> 02:19:12,009
If he hadn't messed
around with Shekhar...

1135
02:19:12,077 --> 02:19:14,511
...Shekhar and his
friends wouldn't...

1136
02:19:15,046 --> 02:19:16,513
What did they do?

1137
02:19:18,049 --> 02:19:22,008
Anjali, please don't
disclose this to anyone.

1138
02:19:22,087 --> 02:19:24,021
Ratan forbade me to do so.

1139
02:19:24,089 --> 02:19:27,024
Please, Anjali,
do it for my sake.

1140
02:20:10,101 --> 02:20:12,569
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

1141
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:14,070
You know perfectly well.

1142
02:20:15,106 --> 02:20:20,066
Shekhar & his friends attempted
to kill you and you kept mum?!

1143
02:20:22,614 --> 02:20:26,573
Ratan, you aren't aware of what
father and I have been through.

1144
02:20:27,619 --> 02:20:29,086
We nearly lost you.

1145
02:20:36,127 --> 02:20:37,594
It's my fault.

1146
02:20:39,631 --> 02:20:42,099
You became the target for
Shekhar's enmity towards me.

1147
02:20:50,141 --> 02:20:51,608
- Where are you going?
- Let me go!

1148
02:20:51,676 --> 02:20:53,109
- Let go of the rod!
- Let me go!

1149
02:20:53,178 --> 02:20:54,110
Leave it!

1150
02:21:00,151 --> 02:21:04,611
Do you want to know why I kept
mum? Listen carefully.

1151
02:21:05,156 --> 02:21:09,115
When I came to my senses,
I noticed that you had changed.

1152
02:21:10,161 --> 02:21:12,129
You had changed completely.

1153
02:21:12,197 --> 02:21:14,631
You had begun to realise
your responsibilities.

1154
02:21:16,167 --> 02:21:19,625
You learned to appreciate
me... and father.

1155
02:21:21,172 --> 02:21:25,131
You became closer to
us. I was very happy.

1156
02:21:26,177 --> 02:21:35,142
For your happiness, I couldn't
care if anything happened to me.

1157
02:21:51,202 --> 02:21:52,669
I have troubled
you so much.

1158
02:21:54,205 --> 02:21:56,173
And yet you have never
said anything to me.

1159
02:21:57,208 --> 02:21:58,675
Then leave
everything behind.

1160
02:21:58,743 --> 02:22:00,677
I have prepared the
new cycle for you.

1161
02:22:00,745 --> 02:22:03,680
Take it and try your best
at the race tomorrow.

1162
02:22:08,219 --> 02:22:11,188
The brave sportsmen have
set off for their destination.

1163
02:22:11,256 --> 02:22:14,692
A 50 km cycle race.

1164
02:22:14,759 --> 02:22:16,192
From the stadium
to Pykara junction.

1165
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:19,196
...then a 20 km passage
through Baramulla Hills...

1166
02:22:19,264 --> 02:22:21,698
...to the highest point.

1167
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:30,707
'We are as good
as anyone' - Model.

1168
02:22:41,753 --> 02:22:43,220
The cyclists are
passing through.

1169
02:22:43,288 --> 02:22:44,721
It remains to be seen...

1170
02:22:44,789 --> 02:22:46,723
...who crosses the dangerous
terrain of Baramulla.

1171
02:22:58,770 --> 02:23:00,237
"Baramulla Hills"

1172
02:23:58,329 --> 02:24:01,787
I'm Rakesh Sharma reporting
from check post 2 at Pillar Rock.

1173
02:24:03,334 --> 02:24:06,792
The first cyclists have
reached Pillar Rock.

1174
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:08,805
In the lead is Shekhar
Malhotra from Rajput College.

1175
02:24:18,349 --> 02:24:21,318
In fifth place is Sanjaylal
Sharma from Model College.

1176
02:24:59,390 --> 02:25:00,857
Be careful,
or you might fall!

1177
02:25:03,895 --> 02:25:06,864
- Come along.
- The jerk is losing air.

1178
02:25:56,447 --> 02:26:00,907
I was bound by my
promise to Ratan...

1179
02:26:00,985 --> 02:26:02,919
...but I won't spare you now.

1180
02:26:07,959 --> 02:26:10,928
Because of you, my brother is not
participating in today's race.

1181
02:26:16,467 --> 02:26:18,935
I'll see how you are
able to finish this race.

1182
02:26:19,003 --> 02:26:22,939
Get lost, jerk! I'll see
how you try to stop me.

1183
02:26:42,493 --> 02:26:43,960
You hit my brother.

1184
02:26:45,496 --> 02:26:46,963
This is Ratan's reply.

1185
02:27:03,514 --> 02:27:06,972
You won't let me
finish the race, eh?

1186
02:27:11,522 --> 02:27:13,990
They've gone ahead!

1187
02:27:14,525 --> 02:27:17,494
Shekhar, you go ahead.
We'll take care of him.

1188
02:27:17,562 --> 02:27:18,995
Don't set him free.

1189
02:27:19,530 --> 02:27:20,497
Well...

1190
02:28:20,591 --> 02:28:22,559

02:29:14,645 --> 02:29:17,113

1199
02:29:18,149 --> 02:29:19,616

1200
02:29:20,651 --> 02:29:22,118

1202
02:29:44,675 --> 02:29:46,643

02:30:08,199 --> 02:30:11,168
Sanjaylal Sharma has
started his first lap.

1204
02:30:12,703 --> 02:30:14,671
He has now overtaken a
cyclist from Xavier's...

1205
02:30:14,739 --> 02:30:16,172
...to occupy the
10th position.

1206
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:19,175
Moving at great speed, Shekhar
has come to the 5th position.

1207
02:30:20,711 --> 02:30:23,680
Shekhar Malhotra has
started his second lap.

1208
02:30:24,715 --> 02:30:27,684
Sanjaylal is

1209
02:30:36,727 --> 02:30:40,185

1210
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:51,708
Shekhar Malhotra is

1211
02:30:55,746 --> 02:30:58,214

02:31:17,768 --> 02:31:19,235
He's approaching Shekhar.

1213
02:31:19,770 --> 02:31:21,237
He's come closer.

1214
02:31:24,775 --> 02:31:26,743
And that's the end
of the third lap.

1215
02:31:43,794 --> 02:31:45,762
A little bit more!

1216
02:31:52,803 --> 02:31:54,771
This is the fifth
and last lap!

1217
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:12,288
The Championship
is only 200m away.

1218
02:34:08,939 --> 02:34:11,407
Mr Ramlal, even
I accept it today.

1219
02:34:12,443 --> 02:34:14,911
"He who wins is
the conqueror!"
