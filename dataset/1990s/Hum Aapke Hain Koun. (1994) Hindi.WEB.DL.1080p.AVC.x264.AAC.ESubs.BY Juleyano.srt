1
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:53,093
"Who am I to you?"

2
00:00:54,161 --> 00:01:01,124
"Who am I to you?"

3
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:23,536
"My eyes are restless!"

4
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:31,458
"This is the effect of love!"

5
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:39,354
"Can't be mum, all I can say is that..."

6
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,196
"...who am I to you?"

7
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:56,019
"Who am I to you?"

8
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:11,066
"I had to restrain myself, my love."

9
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:18,940
"Ultimately, I had to say it."

10
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:26,799
"In my dreams... why do you come?"

11
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:34,769
"Who am I to you?"

12
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:43,496
"Who am I to you?"

13
00:02:51,674 --> 00:02:58,955
"My eyes are restless!"

14
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:06,361
"This is the effect of love!"

15
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:14,111
"I'm sort of lost...
please don't ask me..."

16
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:22,250
"...who am I to you?"

17
00:03:23,195 --> 00:03:30,064
"Who am I to you?"

18
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:45,999
"How should I tell you
the feelings in my heart?"

19
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:54,057
"Try to read my face sometimes."

20
00:03:54,805 --> 00:04:01,455
"You may call it my shyness!"

21
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:09,673
"Who am I to you?"

22
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:17,517
"Who am I to you?"

23
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:25,468
"Who am I to you?"

24
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:40,573
COMMENTATOR: We welcome all
the spectators to 'Prem Nivas'.

25
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:44,979
Hello!

26
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:49,799
- Greetings to one and all from Lalloo Prasad!

27
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:51,907
The match is about to begin
in a short while from now.

28
00:04:51,932 --> 00:04:54,853
I will be giving the live commentary.

29
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:58,156
The sky is absolutely clear...
there are a few clouds.

30
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:03,205
The umpire has inspected the pitch
and is about to take his place.

31
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,007
The batsman is ready. Fielders, be alert.

32
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:17,312
Presenting to you, one who bowls
at a speed faster than the wind!

33
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,687
I will hit him for a 6,
off the first ball itself.

34
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,013
Should I hit him for a 4 or a 6?

35
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:38,032
Go, Lalloo Prasad!

36
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:39,859
How's that?

37
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,828
Hey Lalloo,
you are always out to the first ball!

38
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:50,593
- I just gave the bowler a chance.
- What did you say?

39
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:53,273
- It's your turn to bat.
- No, it's my turn. I will play too.

40
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:57,397
You must be aware as to what
happened when Rita last came to bat.

41
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:58,937
She broke her leg.

42
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,304
Oh, shut up!

43
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:03,875
Prem will coach me this time.
Won't you, Prem?

44
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:07,984
Will I coach you?
Go and field on the boundary line.

45
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,187
You always ask me to field.

46
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:12,009
It's similar to what you've been doing
to hook Prem for all these years.

47
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:12,407
What?

48
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,320
You will field, while Prem will bat.

49
00:06:14,345 --> 00:06:16,437
- You will go and bowl.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:18,399
LALLOO: Kapil Dev, come to my rescue!

51
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:20,117
Protect yourself from my attack, Prem.

52
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:22,359
Here comes Lalloo with his googly.

53
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,992
Hey!

54
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,328
LALLOO: Rita, catch the ball.

55
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,067
BHAGVANTI: I'm dead. I'm dead.
- Don't utter inauspicious things.

56
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:38,539
My back is broken.

57
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:42,226
- I'm sorry, auntie!
- You fool, what are you doing here?

58
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:42,726
Oh...

59
00:06:42,751 --> 00:06:44,915
Auntie, she had come here
to learn to play cricket.

60
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,133
This game of cricket
is becoming a nuisance.

61
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:52,461
- Kids will always play!
- Quiet!

62
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,187
Greetings, auntie!

63
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:58,305
How many times have I told
you not to call me auntie?

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,688
Not only humans, but dogs too
are pampered here in this house.

65
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,984
Why are you staring at me? Come with me.

66
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:11,445
- I'm dead!
- Uncle, why is auntie in such a haste?

67
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:17,545
She's come to talk to your uncle
about your brother, Rajesh's wedding.

68
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:22,426
Honestly speaking, Rajesh is worth
every good word spoken about him!

69
00:07:23,078 --> 00:07:24,826
Not only me,
but everybody is of the same opinion.

70
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:28,953
It's not a joke to manage this
big business at such young age!

71
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,601
- What do you say?
- Perfect!

72
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:33,039
You have to think about his wedding now.

73
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,493
Tell me, if you know of any good girl.

74
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,140
- I have seen the girl.
- Is that so?

75
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,203
You have met my brother from Delhi,
Rita's dad, haven't you? - Yes.

76
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:45,484
I was referring to his elder daughter,
that's Rita's elder sister, Sweetie.

77
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:48,883
Sweetie has always been with him
in Delhi and Rita's been with me.

78
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:52,265
Sweetie is a very beautiful,
understanding and decent girl!

79
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:54,414
- Isn't that so?
- Yes. She's failed in B.A.

80
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,976
She thinks in terms of
the present generation.

81
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,774
She's already had a couple of
broken engagements. Isn't that so?

82
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:04,084
So what? Think about the big family.
Their business is worth millions.

83
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,594
The wedding will be a pompous one.

84
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,812
She'll bring along something
worthwhile as dowry, too.

85
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:11,078
But you won't understand
these norms of life!

86
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,961
After all,
you are a professor at the college.

87
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:16,477
If you agree,
I will inform my brother accordingly.

88
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:20,219
Rita, it's time for our kitty party.
Let's go!

89
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:22,836
- We're leaving.
- Thanks!

90
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:24,937
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

91
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:26,576
- I'll leave, brother.
- Okay!

92
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,407
Come on. You're quite a hog.

93
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,828
Wealth is all that she thinks of!

94
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,168
We don't want her rich brother's daughter.

95
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,953
What we want is a down-to-earth
and a lovely daughter-in-law!

96
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,071
One who will bless this
house with her love and care!

97
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:47,453
You have brought up this
house with so much love!

98
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:51,211
Rajesh and Prem were so small
when sister and her husband died.

99
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,313
You abandoned your studies too
to look after these children.

100
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:57,016
You started off with a small job.

101
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:00,571
For their future,
you only thought of hard work as your goal.

102
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:02,466
You didn't marry too!

103
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,453
You've brought up these
children with such good values!

104
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,344
That's the reason for Rajesh's success.

105
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:09,188
Prem too has stood first
at the MBA exams this year.

106
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:09,797
Am I right?

107
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:13,273
Brother, I have seen a girl for Rajesh.

108
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,179
Sometime back,
I had gone to Pune for a conference.

109
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,852
I met Professor S. S.
Chowdhury over there.

110
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,242
- Would that be Prof. Siddharth Chowdhury?
- Do you know him?

111
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:25,352
We've studied in the same college.
We were very good friends.

112
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:27,976
I met his elder daughter over there.

113
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:31,446
Just saw her for once, and she's
made a home for herself in my heart!

114
00:09:31,765 --> 00:09:34,336
I liked her so much that I
brought her photograph too.

115
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,641
Her name is Pooja. She's passed B.A.
Very sweet in nature!

116
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,321
- They'll make a good pair.
- I agree!

117
00:09:41,492 --> 00:09:44,908
Professor has gone on a pilgrimage
with his family to Ramtekdi.

118
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:47,999
As soon as he returns, we'll pay him a
visit. It's just a trip of 3-4 hours.

119
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,844
All that's required is for them to like
each other. - That's the main problem.

120
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:54,320
Whenever I talk about marriage to
Rajesh, he ignores it.

121
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:56,359
How can we make the two of them meet?

122
00:09:56,494 --> 00:09:58,788
There is a way.
Why don't we go to Ramtekdi too?

123
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:00,249
It would be a combination of
a holiday and a pilgrimage.

124
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,055
And also the selection of sister-in-law.

125
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,281
- Great!
- Very good idea!

126
00:10:02,327 --> 00:10:05,367
But brother shouldn't be aware of this plan.
Everyone should be alert.

127
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:06,430
It's a top secret!

128
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,883
Big brother is here. Come on, uncle.

129
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,789
So you're back, Rajesh.
Your meeting took a long time today!

130
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,391
What did the foreign collaborators say?

131
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:23,453
We had a detailed discussion.
They'll study our report now.

132
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,053
Uncle, if everything works out properly...

133
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,804
...like you said, this factory will be
the first of its kind in this country!

134
00:10:30,273 --> 00:10:35,008
Prem, your brother is setting up
such a big factory to launch you.

135
00:10:35,446 --> 00:10:37,179
LALLOO: Big brother, the food is ready.

136
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,359
Hey, there's a feast out here!
Is it some special occasion?

137
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:46,711
- Actually, big brother...
- Well, we all are very happy today.

138
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:47,383
Happy?

139
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,319
Well, big brother, we have decided
to go to Ramtekdi for our holidays.

140
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,409
Ramtekdi? But uncle, you were
insisting on going to a hill station.

141
00:10:55,517 --> 00:11:00,412
Ramtekdi is a very holy place.
My uncle and aunt go there every year.

142
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,569
- They make vows too!
- The program is fixed.

143
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:06,139
This time we'll take that
new dress of yours, too.

144
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,498
- Why is it needed over there?
- Why not?!

145
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:10,310
You never know...

146
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,725
- What did he say, uncle?
- I didn't hear.

147
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,444
We don't interfere in such matters.
Chameli, let's get some food.

148
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,911
Strange! Nobody is telling me anything.

149
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:33,530
What should we tell you, brother...
as to what we will get at Ramtekdi.

150
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:14,381
Hurry up, dad!

151
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:18,550
Mom will be mad, if she catches you
doing this experiment in the kitchen.

152
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:21,060
Let her be angry. I'm not afraid of her.

153
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:24,987
If she notices these sweets,
she'll be tempted to break her fast.

154
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,940
PROF. CHOWDHURY: Are you listening?

155
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:28,419
- What is it?
- It's not me, but mom.

156
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,498
PROF. CHOWDHURY: Very angrily he
said, "You foolish man!"

157
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:52,966
Seeing everybody scared
and Sita restless...

158
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,208
- Who broke the jar?
- What?

159
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,388
Who broke the jar?

160
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:02,021
Pooja, when Lord Rama
broke Lord Shiva's bow...

161
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:05,708
...Parshurama very angrily asked
as to who had broken the bow.

162
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:09,482
Lord Rama, with all
simplicity and love replied...

163
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:14,863
"''O God, someone from your slaves
must have broken Lord Shiva's bow."

164
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:17,980
Have some shame. We've got two grown
up girls. What will they think?

165
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,871
What will they think?
Did I say something wrong, my love?

166
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:23,253
I didn't say anything wrong. I was just...

167
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,480
It's difficult for both
of us to win against you.

168
00:13:25,683 --> 00:13:27,620
- If anyone can win against you, it will be...
- Nisha!

169
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:36,269
MAN: Hey...

170
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:37,870
Good morning, manager uncle!

171
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:50,518
Devil! You always come
like an express train!

172
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:53,986
Dad has sent the books from the
library and has said thanks.

173
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:54,617
Okay!

174
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:03,431
- Brother, your bill?
- Here's the bill. You remove the books.

175
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:06,541
- Then, I'll leave...
- Okay, that's also fine.

176
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,416
Nisha child,
will you do me a small favour?

177
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,064
Will you add this up by the time
we come back from the storeroom?

178
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,072
- Sure!
- Very good! But, listen...

179
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:16,806
...don't indulge in any mischief.

180
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:21,384
Come on, now. What are you staring at?

181
00:14:50,596 --> 00:14:51,299
Excuse me!

182
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:54,611
Is this Ram Narayan guesthouse?

183
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,736
Didn't you read the board outside?
Where was I?!

184
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,533
- 75 and 9...
- 84!

185
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,345
What is it? - Can you tell me
which room Prof. Chowdhury is in?

186
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,892
- Why?
- Well... I had some work.

187
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:28,025
- I understood.
- What?

188
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,134
- Stand up!
- Pardon?

189
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:34,744
Stand up! You people don't
study the whole year...

190
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:35,150
What?

191
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:39,101
Yes, you don't study the whole year
and then panic at the time of exams.

192
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,251
And now, you've come here
to enhance your marks.

193
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,330
You better enhance the number
of your glasses, madam!

194
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:46,064
Wonder what you think of yourself
after sitting on the manager's chair!

195
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,307
- Well...
- POOJA: Nisha!

196
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:48,658
Oh, God!

197
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,408
POOJA: Nisha... - I'm over here, sister.

198
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:13,447
You're sitting here!
Mom is waiting for you out there.

199
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:16,650
- What were you doing?
- Well, I was... I was...

200
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,541
Welcome! - Uncle,
you proceed while I keep the baggage.

201
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,122
- Okay, dear!
- Come, let's go!

202
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,516
You were asking for Prof.
Chowdhury, right?

203
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,518
These are his daughters, Pooja and Nisha.

204
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:35,637
Pooja child, he is Mr. Kailashnath.
He's your dad's pal.

205
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,770
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

206
00:16:37,854 --> 00:16:40,392
- He wants to meet the professor.
- Please, come.

207
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:42,510
I'll take your leave.

208
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,971
Oh, manager uncle...

209
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,814
Take this. I've calculated it.

210
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:52,697
You have? That's great!
Here's your reward.

211
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:55,572
Thank you!

212
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:59,236
Manager, you please recalculate.

213
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:02,564
People say that beautiful girls
are always wrong at calculating.

214
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,479
- What did you say?
- Do you eat chocolates, Miss Nisha?

215
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:08,223
Don't mention my name.

216
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,408
These snacks taste great, professor!

217
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:20,134
Have it with this 'chutney' and you
will forget the famous 'Mathura snacks'.

218
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,089
Mr. Siddharth!

219
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,972
Hey... Kai...

220
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:30,830
- Kailashnath! What a plesant surprise! Wow!

221
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:35,048
- My younger nephew, Prem.
- May you live long, child!

222
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,775
- Your uncle has lost a bet.
- Which one?

223
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,673
He had said that only I would go
bald, but he has lost his hair too.

224
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:41,778
Have a look!

225
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,416
Hello, see who has come...

226
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,658
- Greetings! Recognize me?
- How are you?

227
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,658
He has to be fine. After all,
he's one of the top industrialists!

228
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:54,729
Come and have a seat.

229
00:17:56,602 --> 00:18:00,166
Truly, whenever I read about you
in the papers, I feel very proud!

230
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:01,666
It's all right!

231
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:05,338
Prem, you may not be aware about
the history of the three of us.

232
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:09,330
We were in college together and we
had a lot of fun. Right, Kailashnath?

233
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:11,885
Keep it here.

234
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:14,603
- You've already met my daughters, right?
- Yes.

235
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:19,009
Do you come here every year?

236
00:18:20,354 --> 00:18:21,877
I've come this year with
a very special mission.

237
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:22,713
Really?

238
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:26,314
I'd like my nephew Rajesh to get
married to your elder daughter.

239
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:27,540
PROF. CHOWDHURY: Pooja?

240
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:29,080
MR. KAILASHNATH: Yes.

241
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,979
That's if you don't have any objections.

242
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:35,376
Objection? What are you talking?
After all, he's your nephew!

243
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,979
Still... Rajesh has come with us.
You meet him, once.

244
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,893
- Go and call brother.
- You mean...

245
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:42,876
Yes! Go, right ahead.

246
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:46,244
Kailashnath!

247
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:52,541
- Thanks!
- Professor, I should be thanking you.

248
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:57,103
God has given me everything!
The love of these children...

249
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,666
...a big business empire...
but the house seems barren!

250
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,541
Rajesh has had his share
of motherly love...

251
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,220
...but Prem has been
deprived of that love.

252
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:17,830
- Come on, brother!
- Come in, Rajesh.

253
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,951
The Professor... and his wife.

254
00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:22,012
- Greetings! Please, sit...
- Have a seat, child.

255
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:40,803
Apart from your work,
what are your other hobbies?

256
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,182
Brother paints very well.
Isn't that right, brother?

257
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,350
- Is that so?
- Just a little bit.

258
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,615
Pooja paints well too, isn't that so?

259
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:50,256
Pooja...

260
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:52,912
Go!

261
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,389
Yes, dad. - Show Rajesh that painting
of the temple that you're doing.

262
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:01,545
Brother, let's go and see the painting.
We'll just be back, uncle.

263
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,975
Come on brother,
let's have a look at the painting.

264
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,462
- Where are you going?
- How does it concern you?

265
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:16,342
You let them talk. You can talk to me.

266
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,481
- What should I talk to you?
- Why?

267
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:21,694
Are you still angry with me?

268
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:22,639
Miss Nisha...

269
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:24,516
Don't mention my name.

270
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,639
- Mom...
- Dad...

271
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:34,967
- It's a very nice painting!
- Thank you.

272
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:40,936
You paint too, don't you?

273
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:41,865
Yes.

274
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,225
I do paint but... not so beautiful!

275
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:00,897
Give it to me.

276
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,139
Brother, did you like the painting?

277
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,982
I've been noticing since the afternoon.

278
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:14,584
You've been asking me the same
question every 15 minutes.

279
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:16,467
- What's the matter?
- Matter?

280
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,889
Well, I will go and get you some nice tea.

281
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:21,426
Wait!

282
00:21:24,381 --> 00:21:25,952
Tell me, what is the truth?

283
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:27,842
Promise me that you will neither scold
me, nor will you beat me.

284
00:21:27,928 --> 00:21:29,389
- Promise?
- Yes, it's a promise.

285
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:31,646
Did you like the painting?

286
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:32,748
Yes.

287
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:35,959
- Did you like the colors of the painting?
- Yes.

288
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:38,553
Did you like the one who did the painting?

289
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:46,732
That's great! We had brought
you here to hear this. Congrats!

290
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,458
- Uncle...
- You wait!

291
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:51,779
Uncle, brother's life is made.

292
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:52,491
Prem!

293
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,194
Greetings, priest!

294
00:21:56,094 --> 00:21:58,201
- Sister-in-law, save me!

295
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:22,637
"You're great Lord...
what a pair you have created!"

296
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,161
"Congratulations to my
brother and sister-in-law!"

297
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,019
"More than any other
ritual in this world..."

298
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:36,684
"...the relation of hearts
is the most important!"

299
00:22:37,318 --> 00:22:42,372
"Thanks to you, this event has
seen the light of the day."

300
00:22:43,677 --> 00:22:48,637
"Congratulations to my
sister and brother-in-law!"

301
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,543
"More than any other
ritual in this world..."

302
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:56,366
"...the relation of hearts
is the most important!"

303
00:22:56,685 --> 00:23:02,075
- "You're great Lord!"
- "You're great Lord!"

304
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:06,115
"You're great Lord!"

305
00:23:28,828 --> 00:23:34,950
"My brother, who is sitting so quietly."

306
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:40,428
"Sister-in-law,
have a look at his stubborn posture."

307
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:43,928
"But, he is a very good guy."

308
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:48,411
"He is a very good guy,
but a bit naughty."

309
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:51,873
"You're the only one
that he has fallen for!"

310
00:23:52,092 --> 00:23:57,352
"My sister is acting tough now!"

311
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:03,428
"Congratulations to my
brother and sister-in-law!"

312
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:08,333
"More than any other
ritual in this world..."

313
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:11,389
"...the relation of hearts
is the most important!"

314
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:17,248
- "You're great, Lord!"
- "You're great, Lord!"

315
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:20,913
"You're great, Lord!"

316
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:49,675
"Brother-in-law, for your sake..."

317
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,621
"...my sister has prayed a lot!"

318
00:24:56,597 --> 00:25:01,634
"She's been to the temples..."
"She's been to the temples..."

319
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:03,253
"...prayed day and night!"

320
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,869
"She's been invoking
Almighty all the time"

321
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:12,232
"I've got a daughter-in-law
as I had desired!"

322
00:25:13,451 --> 00:25:18,529
"Congratulations to my
sister and brother-in-law!"

323
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:23,254
"More than any other
ritual in this world..."

324
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:26,068
"...the relation of hearts
is the most important!"

325
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:32,193
- "You're great, Lord!"
- "You're great, Lord!"

326
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,840
"You're great, Lord!"

327
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,058
Tuffy... Tuffy... Tuffy...

328
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:05,401
That's a nice garland you've
brought, Tuffy!

329
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,596
Tuffy too knows that this evening,
folks from brother's in-law's place...

330
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:11,151
...are coming with the ritual offerings.

331
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,932
There shouldn't be anything amiss
in welcoming them. Right, Tuffy?

332
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:14,682
Great!

333
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:19,362
- Big brother, is she coming too?
- I'll just be back, uncle.

334
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:23,112
- What happened?
- You'll always stay a fool!

335
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:23,566
Why?

336
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,800
Uncle, does the girl come
over before the wedding?

337
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:29,667
How do I know? We aren't married as yet.

338
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:33,324
Brother!

339
00:26:34,214 --> 00:26:34,621
Yes?

340
00:26:35,354 --> 00:26:35,925
Come!

341
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,144
You are needed desperately
down here in the hall.

342
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:40,808
The doctor has come, too.

343
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:42,644
What does he think of himself?!

344
00:26:42,784 --> 00:26:44,883
Let him come. I'll take care of him.

345
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,141
- Greetings, doctor.
- Greetings!

346
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,415
What's the matter? Why are you so angry?

347
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:51,610
Are you asking me?

348
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:55,246
You ask him that question.

349
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:57,743
He confirmed Rajesh's marriage,
chose the daughter-in-law.

350
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,446
I get the news today.

351
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,711
- Doctor...
- What?!

352
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,407
What is it? I don't want it.

353
00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:06,196
I'm very angry today.
I will neither eat, nor drink today.

354
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:09,118
I'm leaving. Congratulations!
Goodbye. Move aside!

355
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:13,680
The photo of my daughter-in-law
is on the table.

356
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:20,852
How did you like daughter-in-law?

357
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:22,892
Pal...

358
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:25,657
Her simplicity reminds me of a poem.

359
00:27:25,673 --> 00:27:29,476
Sit down. Doctor will recite a poem.

360
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:31,836
- It goes something like this...
- Wow, wow...

361
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,524
Let me start the poem.

362
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:37,493
'I've turned into a photo
after looking at the photo...

363
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:38,353
Wow!

364
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:41,172
'I've turned into a photo
after looking at the photo...

365
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,790
...l'm so jealous of my
friend's good fortune.'

366
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:45,212
Wow, wow!

367
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,836
Have a look!
He told me that he is very angry.

368
00:27:50,032 --> 00:27:51,517
Told me not to talk to anyone.

369
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:55,399
One look at daughter-in-law's
photo and your anger vanished!

370
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:57,954
Welcome, sister-in-law!

371
00:27:58,172 --> 00:28:02,132
I can understand that you
are a heart specialist...

372
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:03,139
...and sister-in-law
is a child specialist.

373
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:07,609
What I can't understand is this
combination of a doctor and a poet.

374
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:11,407
That's something he has
taken very seriously.

375
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:13,500
Uncle, why do you indulge in this poetry?

376
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:16,604
Poetry in its truest form
is always in front of you!

377
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:20,374
What did you say? What did you say?

378
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,362
Wait! Did you hear that?
This younger one talks a lot these days.

379
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:31,912
Shall we get you married
too, along with your brother?

380
00:28:31,937 --> 00:28:36,602
- Auntie, why delay something good?
- Shameless!

381
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:38,735
- Hi!
- Hi!

382
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:41,782
I heard doctor auntie's talks.

383
00:28:42,235 --> 00:28:44,922
It's your turn to search for a bride.

384
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,407
I'm just coming. Somebody is calling me.

385
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,571
- Hi!
- Oh, no!

386
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:51,938
Whenever I want to talk to you,
somebody always calls for you.

387
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:54,852
But I know very well how
to win over your heart.

388
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,315
The formula to make
sweets in half an hour.

389
00:28:57,456 --> 00:29:01,883
First of all, the utensil... where's it?

390
00:29:02,024 --> 00:29:02,750
Utensil...

391
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:04,740
Oh, no!

392
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,102
Stupid, I'm hurt.

393
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:09,383
How could I know that
you were standing here?

394
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,461
- Quiet! Give me the utensil.
- Utensil...

395
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:14,891
By the way, baby, what are you doing here?

396
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:19,571
- I'm making sweets.
- So you're making sweets for Prem!

397
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,219
Are you making it as per this book?

398
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,218
- Don't touch!
- Don't touch.

399
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:25,664
Just answer whatever I ask of you.

400
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,657
- Where's the semolina?
- It's over there.

401
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:29,688
- Butter?
- Right next to it.

402
00:29:31,298 --> 00:29:33,266
- Sugar?
- In that jar.

403
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:37,337
- Baby, you are...
- Stupid!

404
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:39,259
Listen!

405
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:42,277
- What happened?
- She brought salt instead of sugar.

406
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:51,172
- Why don't you tell her?
- Let it be. She called you stupid.

407
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:53,485
Congratulations, brother!

408
00:29:53,604 --> 00:29:57,094
The news of Rajesh's engagement
has gladdened my heart.

409
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,407
I've just been to the
temple to offer my prayers.

410
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:01,274
She's coming from the beauty parlour.

411
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:02,814
What happened?

412
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:04,375
Okay!

413
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:08,728
I've heard that daughter-in-law's
dad is a professor at a college.

414
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:09,345
Yes, right!

415
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:11,907
In that case, there must not
have been any talks of dowry.

416
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:16,585
He must be like him,
a simpleton all his life.

417
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,704
Don't say that.
He's from a very big family.

418
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:24,032
But he is his friend.
Whatever he gives has to be accepted.

419
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:27,374
If my Sweetie were to come,
she would have brought a lot.

420
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:29,554
So much that the safe wouldn't be
able to accommodate everything.

421
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,030
My Rajesh is worth millions!

422
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:34,110
Something worth millions
is being made... Sweets!

423
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:34,468
Sweet!

424
00:30:34,493 --> 00:30:36,679
- Rita baby is making it.
- Is baby making it?

425
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,571
- Will you taste it?
- Give me some.

426
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:39,682
I'll get it, right away.

427
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:43,336
- Baby, is the sweet ready?
- Yes!

428
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,290
I've praised your sweet a lot outside.

429
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:45,884
Really!

430
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:48,899
Your aunt wants to die... I mean taste it.

431
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:50,844
I'll just go and give it.

432
00:30:51,802 --> 00:30:54,493
Baby, you've learnt a lot.

433
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:57,657
Auntie, eat with this big spoon.
Baby has made it.

434
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:00,485
Have it.

435
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:11,641
- What happened?
- Auntie liked the sweet a lot.

436
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,346
Have all of this, auntie.

437
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:23,477
Is this what you call sweet?
It's full of salt.

438
00:31:23,502 --> 00:31:26,111
- Salt?
- Yes. It's very bitter.

439
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,463
My dear, it's your tongue that's bitter.

440
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:29,635
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

441
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,291
The girl's family is about to come.
You wipe your face.

442
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:33,394
Yeah... okay, okay!

443
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:37,814
Move aside with your sweet. - Rita,
you won't be able to make this sweet.

444
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:43,604
If I can't make the sweet for
you, who can?

445
00:31:57,774 --> 00:31:59,829
Greetings! Please, come.

446
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:01,493
Oh, Mr. Kailashnath!

447
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:03,393
- How are you?
- May you live long!

448
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:05,111
May you live long, son. How are you?

449
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:05,517
Fine!

450
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:06,260
How are you, son?

451
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,861
- Hi, Nisha!
- Hi...

452
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:12,697
Welcome!

453
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,941
Thanks!

454
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:23,731
Computers!

455
00:32:24,106 --> 00:32:26,035
You're studying computers? Wow!

456
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:29,410
Nisha... Lalloo and Chameli
have come to meet you.

457
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:31,104
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

458
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:34,416
Meet him, too. He happens to be the
most loved member of this family.

459
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:36,262
- How sweet!
- He never bites.

460
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:38,020
He only loves.

461
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,785
- Brother-in-law! You show us your paintings.
- Definitely, come.

462
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,644
Rajesh, please come here, dear.

463
00:32:46,957 --> 00:32:49,824
This father-in-law of yours
is a very interesting person.

464
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:54,214
I'll just be there.
Prem, you please show Nisha the paintings.

465
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:55,270
Wow!

466
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,098
Really...

467
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:58,439
...brother-in-law is truly great.

468
00:32:59,316 --> 00:33:00,387
This is so good!

469
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,659
- And this is... beautiful!
- Beautiful!

470
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:09,308
I'll show you the most beautiful painting
done by my brother. Please, come.

471
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:13,363
- Chocolates?!
- Oh, chocolates! Thanks... please, come!

472
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:22,113
How is it?

473
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:28,192
Do you know to play the
instrument or are you just posing?

474
00:33:28,918 --> 00:33:30,481
People tell me that I play very well.

475
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:33,933
You may make a decision, when you hear it.

476
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:39,449
I almost forgot. Sister has sent this
gift for you. - Sister-in-law sent it?

477
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:40,567
Wow!

478
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:43,062
I told her that it wasn't necessary.

479
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:44,780
Open it.

480
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:49,543
Wow! A Brooch!

481
00:33:50,206 --> 00:33:54,254
Put it on your coat. It will make a
good impression on your girlfriends.

482
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:01,332
Miss Nisha!

483
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,808
Miss Nisha!

484
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,535
Please help me put it.

485
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,251
Move aside!

486
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,300
Ouch!

487
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:22,520
Sorry!

488
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:23,119
Did that prick?

489
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:28,918
So, just like that? - I would have
felt this way, if it had pricked.

490
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:29,879
Very smart!

491
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:40,861
Ouch!

492
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,603
- What happened?
- This time, it pricked.

493
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,556
When it pricks, it feels this way.

494
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:50,345
Brother!

495
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,157
You two are wanted downstairs.

496
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:54,134
It's time for the religious ceremony.

497
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:56,796
Shall we go in, Miss Nisha?

498
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:58,699
It's time for the
relation to be confirmed.

499
00:34:59,169 --> 00:34:59,926
Very smart!

500
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:11,530
Hey... hey!

501
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,193
Kailashnath... Rajesh is ours now.

502
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,511
Come and give me a hug.
Henceforth, I won't be in demand.

503
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:20,614
Why? - Well, I'm from the girl's side.
I have to bow down!

504
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:21,950
I mean...

505
00:35:23,036 --> 00:35:25,591
We won't spare you two,
by just hugging each other.

506
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,792
- What then?
- We will have some song and dance now.

507
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,995
No problem!

508
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:29,769
Get the musical instruments.

509
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,360
The party is on,
but who will put life into it?

510
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:38,931
Shall I tell? It's a day of the in-laws.
One should sing and the other dance.

511
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,658
- Dear in-law, sing something for us.
- Me?

512
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:42,986
Yes.

513
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:46,295
I don't have that charm.
You're the charming one!

514
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,162
Not really!

515
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:48,772
- Shall I reveal your secret?
- No.

516
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:51,357
Why not? You've done it to me so many
times, when I was young! - Quiet!

517
00:35:51,503 --> 00:35:54,974
It's about the time,
when we three used to study together.

518
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:57,544
His uncle, me and my wife.

519
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,693
Her smile is beyond comparison even today.

520
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:04,184
There was a time when everyone
was dying for her one look.

521
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:08,474
- I'll just be back.
- Where are you going?

522
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:14,232
Your loving uncle too,
was one among those crazy about her smile!

523
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,116
- Brother, you?
- Uncle, you?

524
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:17,633
No...

525
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,404
Don't lie. Don't lie.

526
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:28,123
Sing something for the sake
of your shyness and her smile.

527
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:30,248
Rajesh, you please tell
your father-in-law.

528
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:31,639
CROWD: No! No!

529
00:36:31,678 --> 00:36:32,975
Okay, one minute! One minute!

530
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:39,591
Why don't you request him on my behalf?!
It will make a difference.

531
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:43,420
Please, sing something.

532
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:45,623
Great!

533
00:36:56,903 --> 00:37:04,870
"There's this strange
conflict in my heart today."

534
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:11,487
"I'm singing and my
in-law is in front of me."

535
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:18,767
"I should sing something
which is her wish, too"

536
00:37:18,892 --> 00:37:24,694
"I'm singing and my
in-law is in front of me."

537
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:53,577
"The earrings on her ears look
like the Moon and the Sun!"

538
00:37:57,518 --> 00:38:04,785
"The earrings on the ears look
like the Moon and the Sun!"

539
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:11,707
"This 'Banarasi' sari looks great too!"

540
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:18,130
"I'll tell you a secret..."
"I'll tell you a secret."

541
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:26,216
"My in-law is tickled even today
when her anklets make a noise."

542
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:31,966
"It's a secret...
he is tickled even today..."

543
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:37,451
"...when her anklets make a noise."

544
00:39:18,794 --> 00:39:25,546
"The smile on her lips...
the shyness of her eyes!"

545
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:36,734
"The smile on her lips...
the shyness of her eyes!"

546
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:44,132
"Such innocence is a boon!"

547
00:39:44,555 --> 00:39:50,639
"I'll tell you a secret..."
"I'll tell you a secret."

548
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,217
"My in-law is truly blessed! She is
like 'Laxmi' the goddess of wealth..."

549
00:39:56,242 --> 00:39:59,359
"...who has transformed
this house into heaven!"

550
00:39:59,478 --> 00:40:04,992
"My in-law is truly blessed! She is
like 'Laxmi' the goddess of wealth..."

551
00:40:05,062 --> 00:40:10,617
"...who has transformed
this house into heaven!"

552
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,312
"There's this strange
conflict in my heart today"

553
00:40:27,484 --> 00:40:33,171
"I'm singing and my
in-law is in front of me."

554
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:40,296
"What I have to live up to is
a very delicate relationship!"

555
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:45,473
"I'm singing and my
in-law is in front of me."

556
00:41:00,947 --> 00:41:07,677
"She's my shade who's
moving into your house."

557
00:41:12,177 --> 00:41:19,169
"She's my shade who's
moving into your house."

558
00:41:19,614 --> 00:41:26,168
"She's lived like a dream on my eyelids!"

559
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:33,161
"I'll tell you a secret..."
"I'll tell you a secret."

560
00:41:33,193 --> 00:41:36,419
"This life time earnings of mine..."

561
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:41,583
"...is the brilliance of
your lawn henceforth."

562
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:47,708
"It's a secret,
this life time earnings of mine..."

563
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:52,833
"...is the brilliance of
your lawn henceforth."

564
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:58,902
"It's a secret,
this life time earnings of mine..."

565
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:04,341
"...is the brilliance of
your lawn henceforth."

566
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:20,372
It seems that my sister will
die of hunger over here!

567
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:23,677
Why? - Have a look,
my brother-in-law isn't eating anything.

568
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:26,184
- Nothing like that.
- Take this, you feed him yourself.

569
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,247
- Open your mouth.
- No.

570
00:42:29,305 --> 00:42:32,575
If you feed him everything over here,
what will you do for the wedding?

571
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,653
You'll come to know about our
hospitality, when you come over.

572
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:38,653
- You'll come, won't you?
- I'll definitely come.

573
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:41,646
When I come,
there'll be fireworks all around.

574
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:51,888
Bring it here.

575
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,896
Bhola brother!

576
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,951
- Bhola brother, Bhola brother!
- Hey... Oh....

577
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:05,013
What is it? - Please,
do us a favor. Please, have a seat here.

578
00:43:05,038 --> 00:43:07,310
I'm very busy Nisha,
the marriage procession is about to come.

579
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:15,849
If you do our work, I will tell your
mom to choose a nice bride for you.

580
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:17,911
All right, then. Here I go.

581
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:24,076
Sorry, brother.

582
00:43:25,224 --> 00:43:27,333
Nisha, will you make your
brother-in-law sit here?

583
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,669
He'll be sitting there. This seat
is for his brother and his friends.

584
00:43:32,327 --> 00:43:36,380
Let them too know about our hospitality.

585
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,348
I'll do the introductions.

586
00:44:39,161 --> 00:44:41,940
- Uncle, can I have a group photograph.
- Why not?

587
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:45,091
He's Bhola Prasad.
The son of my wife's brother-in-law.

588
00:44:45,153 --> 00:44:46,731
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

589
00:44:47,091 --> 00:44:48,364
- Greetings!
- That's enough, son!

590
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:52,403
Bhola is doing a research on the
works of Kalidas' Shakuntala.

591
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:55,480
By the way, he's on the look out
for a Shakuntala of his own too.

592
00:44:55,504 --> 00:44:56,059
You!

593
00:44:56,473 --> 00:44:58,723
Let us click the photograph.
The stairs will be a nice place.

594
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:02,973
- Thank you!
- Thank you...

595
00:45:03,864 --> 00:45:04,676
Come on!

596
00:45:06,942 --> 00:45:07,786
Let's go!

597
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:10,637
Wow, it's a perfume!

598
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:13,284
Hey, Tuffy... Tuffy!

599
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:33,584
Stupid!

600
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:35,858
Shakuntala!

601
00:45:37,264 --> 00:45:39,444
- Come, brother-in-law.
- Where are you taking him?

602
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,366
He'll sit with us.
They all want to meet him.

603
00:45:42,398 --> 00:45:43,900
He's your brother-in-law! Take him.

604
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,272
- You come, too.
- We too?

605
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,796
We have to take care of you, too!

606
00:45:52,976 --> 00:45:55,999
- Something's fishy, brother.
- I like a challenge.

607
00:45:56,024 --> 00:45:56,844
So, what should we do?

608
00:45:56,919 --> 00:46:00,967
Let's check it out.
Friends, we'll be back soon.

609
00:46:01,296 --> 00:46:01,811
Let's go!

610
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:05,631
- Excuse me!
- What is it?

611
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,155
You please, don't go there.

612
00:46:07,585 --> 00:46:09,335
- Why?
- There's danger over there.

613
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:11,546
Danger?

614
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:14,007
Please have a seat, brother-in-law.

615
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,484
- You have a seat, too.
- Should we sit over here?

616
00:46:17,553 --> 00:46:21,335
Come brother, come. Come fast!

617
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:24,702
Please, sit down.
There won't be a noise when you sit down.

618
00:46:24,822 --> 00:46:26,404
- Okay!
- Okay!

619
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:31,812
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

620
00:46:31,976 --> 00:46:33,475
- You sit!
- Okay!

621
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:36,486
Wait! I'd like to investigate.

622
00:46:36,882 --> 00:46:38,312
- May we?
- Sure!

623
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:05,681
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything is all right.

624
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:08,221
- Please, sit.
- Yes, we will sit but there is a condition.

625
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:10,722
You all will sit first.

626
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,230
That's not done. You are the guest.
You please sit down.

627
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,174
No! We are gentlemen, ladies first!

628
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:25,289
- What's the matter, Prem?
- Brother, one needs to be very cautious...

629
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:28,440
...wherever your loving
sister-in-laws are present.

630
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,996
Wafer?!

631
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:33,347
- I'll just be back, brother-in-law.
- Excuse me!

632
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:37,925
Before you leave,
please show me the place where I can sit.

633
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:42,097
Please, come.
I will give you the most special seat.

634
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:44,277
Don't feel shy. Please, come.

635
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,373
You go and sit there. On top of it.

636
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:55,027
What happened?

637
00:47:58,464 --> 00:47:59,261
What news have you brought?

638
00:47:59,312 --> 00:48:04,589
They've kept brother-in-law's shoes
in a red and yellow sweet box.

639
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:05,925
Really?

640
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:08,277
A, B, C, D, E, F, G!

641
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:14,191
Sister, why are we stealing the shoes?
It's bad to steal.

642
00:48:14,227 --> 00:48:14,667
Shut up!

643
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:18,753
This is a tradition. We'll get cash
from brother-in-law for the shoes.

644
00:48:18,824 --> 00:48:20,019
- Really?
- Yes...

645
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:24,738
The red and yellow sweet box...
the fun starts now.

646
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:33,487
Nobody will doubt that we
have hidden the shoes here.

647
00:48:33,863 --> 00:48:37,355
Be quiet!
We have a lot of enemies over here.

648
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:39,558
Look, sister-in-law is coming.

649
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:09,832
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

650
00:49:10,003 --> 00:49:11,652
- Are you Prem?
- Yes.

651
00:49:11,677 --> 00:49:12,667
There's a call for you.

652
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,449
Call for me? Who could it be?

653
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,440
Be cautious! I'll just be back. Let's go!

654
00:49:22,112 --> 00:49:22,659
Thank you!

655
00:49:25,378 --> 00:49:27,972
- Hello!
- Hello!

656
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,269
- Recognize me? I'm Suman.
- Who Suman?

657
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:37,597
- Excuse me!
- Yes, tell me!

658
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:40,214
The one who was sitting
with you is calling you.

659
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:44,308
Is he? You go ahead. I'll just come.

660
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:48,542
Tuffy, be cautious! I'll be back soon.

661
00:50:09,558 --> 00:50:11,511
Tuffy, will you be my friend?

662
00:50:12,969 --> 00:50:16,026
Tuffy, this is Munia and this is Gudia.

663
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:18,699
Now, bye. Okay? Bye!

664
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:23,855
Come on!

665
00:50:32,974 --> 00:50:35,089
Hide it on the table, fast!

666
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,183
Believe me,
I don't know any Suman or her dad.

667
00:50:45,746 --> 00:50:51,707
What? I loved her? When?
I see, in my last birth?

668
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:52,581
Yes!

669
00:50:53,144 --> 00:50:56,714
Tell me, something.
How is Nisha for this birth?

670
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:01,456
Hung up? These girls are truly selfish.

671
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:09,470
What are you doing here? - I was
waiting for you to finish your talks.

672
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:12,628
- You called me, didn't you?
- Yes, I... did I call?

673
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:15,324
Yes, you called me and now you deny it.

674
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:18,511
We're finished!

675
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:27,401
That breathes life into me!
I was so afraid.

676
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:31,175
- I'll check it up. It's full of sweets.
- What nonsense!

677
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:35,891
The shoes have turned into sweets.

678
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:36,587
Give it to me!

679
00:51:36,612 --> 00:51:37,785
Have a look.

680
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:43,042
NISHA: Only sweets look
good in a sweet box.

681
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:02,654
Prem brother,
these girls have truly fooled us.

682
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:07,520
- Have you accepted defeat so soon?
- Defeat? No way!

683
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:13,490
I'll just be back with some courage.

684
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,435
Good luck!

685
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:23,352
Oh Lord, you are the worker of miracles.
You can do anything.

686
00:52:23,817 --> 00:52:28,663
Lord, please do something so that
we win and they become the fools.

687
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:30,341
Hail Lord!

688
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:32,038
Please do something, Lord.
Please, do something.

689
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:38,645
It'll come off in public.
Are you keen on insulting me in public?

690
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,225
I think, he wants to take us somewhere.

691
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,099
I guess, he knows where the shoes are.

692
00:52:44,663 --> 00:52:45,678
Come on, good boy Tuffy!

693
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,664
Come on!

694
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:48,928
You have worked a miracle, oh Lord!

695
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:52,537
Come on!

696
00:52:52,562 --> 00:52:54,810
Brother, here are the shoes.

697
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:56,146
Good, Lalloo!

698
00:52:57,301 --> 00:53:01,787
Now go and keep this box in that place.

699
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:08,896
Hide the shoes in such a place,
where she just won't find it.

700
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:18,748
- Definitely not!
- Girls, please listen to me.

701
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:22,948
- Let's settle for 500 rupees.
- Definitely not!

702
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:26,529
We will take nothing less than 1001.
Only then, shall we give the shoes.

703
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:29,217
- What do you say, dad?
- Yes, this is a rare opportunity.

704
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:34,256
Ask unflinchingly.
Rajesh, be seated bare footed.

705
00:53:35,514 --> 00:53:37,646
You are too much!
You're sitting amongst these children!

706
00:53:37,776 --> 00:53:40,178
- Get up, Nisha! It's getting late.
- Getting late? Definitely not!

707
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,146
- Repeat along with me. 1001 rupees...
- ...cash.

708
00:53:45,576 --> 00:53:47,311
- Cash?
- Yes!

709
00:53:47,803 --> 00:53:51,155
It's time for me to get up, now. Why?

710
00:53:53,944 --> 00:53:56,803
- Is it your wedding?
- No child, I was...

711
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:58,413
In that case, you please sit down.

712
00:54:00,042 --> 00:54:02,319
Doctor, these sisters-in-law
are very smart.

713
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:02,841
Indeed!

714
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,935
- Where's our tiger?
- I'm over here, uncle.

715
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,068
Look at you! Instead of helping
us, you are busy eating.

716
00:54:13,772 --> 00:54:18,982
Say something. - You do the negotiations
first. I'll speak at the end.

717
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:19,975
- What say, Lalloo?
- Yes...

718
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,596
What do you say?

719
00:54:22,862 --> 00:54:25,425
- Well children, now...
- Definitely not!

720
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:28,443
Well Rajesh, give the cash.

721
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:31,303
Just a minute, uncle!

722
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:36,570
Uncle, tell them to give the shoes
first and then take the cash.

723
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,967
That's perfect! Give with one
hand and take with the other.

724
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:42,288
- That's fantastic, Prem!
- All right. We'll get the shoes.

725
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:44,194
Girls... follow me!

726
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,306
PREM: For beautiful girls...
a beautiful gift.

727
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:06,986
Sister, who has taken the shoes?

728
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:25,244
"You sisters-in-law of the
groom with the green drapes."

729
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,829
"You sisters-in-law of the
groom with the green drapes."

730
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,501
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

731
00:55:34,642 --> 00:55:39,259
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

732
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:48,079
"You brother-in-law of the
bride, don't show off so much."

733
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,642
"You brother-in-law of the
bride, don't show off so much."

734
00:55:53,064 --> 00:56:02,048
"Give the cash and take the shoes" -
"Give the cash and take the shoes."

735
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:06,205
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

736
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:54,214
"Count the cash" - "Get the shoes."

737
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,517
"Enough of your fuss" - "Get the shoes."

738
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,800
- "Am I a fraud?"
- "You should know better."

739
00:56:58,825 --> 00:57:04,471
"You are stubborn" - "Whatever you say!"

740
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:07,909
"Things will get out of
control" - "So be it!"

741
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:10,214
"We'll demand more" - "Doesn't matter."

742
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,487
- "Don't act smart!"
- "The shoes first!"

743
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:16,690
- "The cash first!"
- "The shoes first!"

744
00:57:17,366 --> 00:57:21,565
"We've taken the shoes,
haven't robbed some jewellrey."

745
00:57:21,956 --> 00:57:26,182
"You brother-in-law of the
bride, don't show off so much."

746
00:57:26,638 --> 00:57:31,072
"Give the cash and take the shoes."

747
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:35,596
"Give the cash and take the shoes."

748
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:37,627
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

749
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,885
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

750
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:20,904
- "Have a drink!"
- "Not in the mood."

751
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:23,177
- "Have some snacks!"
- "Not in the mood."

752
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:25,468
"Have an ice cream" - "We've had a lot."

753
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:30,303
- "Have a betel leaf!"
- "We've had a lot."

754
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:34,577
"Some 'Rasmalai '!" - "It's for you."

755
00:58:34,602 --> 00:58:36,740
- "So much of sweet!"
- "It's for you."

756
00:58:36,741 --> 00:58:39,397
"The shoes first" - "Will you eat them?"

757
00:58:39,422 --> 00:58:43,333
- "As you wish!"
- "Not at all!"

758
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:48,279
"You tuneless songs of some lousy poet."

759
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:52,809
"You sisters-in-law of the
groom with the green drapes."

760
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:57,576
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

761
00:58:57,631 --> 00:59:01,880
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

762
00:59:15,002 --> 00:59:16,970
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

763
00:59:16,995 --> 00:59:22,468
"Return the shoes and take the cash."

764
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:05,453
"Give the cash and take the shoes."

765
01:01:05,509 --> 01:01:12,453
"Give the cash and take the shoes."

766
01:02:01,602 --> 01:02:07,024
"Whatever I've learnt from here..."

767
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:11,118
"...l'm taking it all along
with me to my husband's house."

768
01:02:15,196 --> 01:02:23,672
"I'm taking it to my husband's house"
"I'm leaving for my husband's house."

769
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:30,555
"With these memories,
your beloved is leaving..."

770
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,406
"...for an unknown house."

771
01:02:57,467 --> 01:03:01,279
"How can I forget, dad..."

772
01:03:01,304 --> 01:03:06,105
"...all the stories that
I've heard from you?"

773
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:10,599
"Mom, I'm leaving back..."

774
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:15,327
"...all the memories of my childhood!"

775
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:25,350
"My loving sister,
take care of that house too the same way."

776
01:03:53,350 --> 01:04:02,100
"This house of my birth has
become alien to me now."

777
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:06,483
"I've found myself a new world!"

778
01:04:06,522 --> 01:04:11,108
"I'm tied up now to this new relation."

779
01:04:12,007 --> 01:04:17,452
"My father-in-law is my dad
and my husband is my God now."

780
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:21,624
"My brother-in-law is like Lord Krishna."

781
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:33,845
"I'm leaving for my husband's house"
"I'm leaving for my husband's house"

782
01:05:00,819 --> 01:05:01,287
Miss Nisha!

783
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:05,842
If I've made any mistake
while doing all the fun...

784
01:05:07,506 --> 01:05:08,756
...then please, forgive me!

785
01:05:36,835 --> 01:05:39,248
May you live long and always be a bride!

786
01:05:39,324 --> 01:05:40,054
Please, come.

787
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:41,437
Let's go!

788
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:46,100
You come here. Where are you going?

789
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:48,287
You're happy, right?
You are responsible for this relation.

790
01:05:48,297 --> 01:05:49,748
What all has that professor given?!

791
01:05:49,772 --> 01:05:50,499
Has he?

792
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:56,576
He's given a lot.
Diamond necklace, imported car, TV and VCR.

793
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:57,616
- Did you get it all?
- No.

794
01:05:57,648 --> 01:05:58,132
Why?

795
01:05:58,157 --> 01:06:02,249
When we weighed all that against
the weight of our sister-in-law...

796
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:05,998
...the weight of all that goods was
negligible, so we left it there.

797
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:07,459
Left it there?

798
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:10,642
And you, were you just applauding the act?
What is this?

799
01:06:10,715 --> 01:06:13,013
I'll give this to our
daughter-in-law as a blessing.

800
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:14,241
Yes, give her the books.
If it was my Sweetie, who had come...

801
01:06:14,282 --> 01:06:16,311
...I would have laded her with gold.

802
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:21,623
Daughter-in-law,
this necklace belongs to Rajesh's mom.

803
01:06:22,589 --> 01:06:24,209
You alone are the wealth
of this house, now!

804
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:25,905
Hey, it's okay!

805
01:06:29,731 --> 01:06:32,700
May you live long!
This is for you, daughter-in-law.

806
01:06:33,986 --> 01:06:36,866
I'm giving you 'The Ramayan '. Sita is in it!

807
01:06:39,171 --> 01:06:39,819
Daughter-in-law!

808
01:06:40,492 --> 01:06:43,319
'The way a ring is enhanced by
the presence of a diamond...

809
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:49,206
...it's my sincere wish that you two
always live happily in the same way.'

810
01:06:49,231 --> 01:06:50,190
Wow!

811
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:51,909
- Take this, Rajesh, my child.
- Doctor uncle, I...

812
01:06:52,057 --> 01:06:53,401
- What?
- Uncle...

813
01:06:53,623 --> 01:06:55,229
Why are you looking at your uncle?

814
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:57,776
Didn't you take pennies from me
when you used to go to school?

815
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,175
Now that you are big,
have you become rich?

816
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:03,776
Keep it. - At least,
don't scold him this way in front of her.

817
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:07,284
I will scold him this way
even in front of his children!

818
01:07:08,034 --> 01:07:09,345
Hey Rita... that... Yes!

819
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:13,409
This is for you.
Distribute all this among the rest.

820
01:07:14,142 --> 01:07:19,478
Come here, Lalloo.
Daughter-in-law, this is Lalloo, my son.

821
01:07:19,947 --> 01:07:22,969
- Take this.
- No sir, you have given me such respect.

822
01:07:23,462 --> 01:07:26,806
You've also given me such a
good sister-in-law. I'm blessed.

823
01:07:27,011 --> 01:07:28,979
Will you at least accept it from
the hands of your sister-in-law?

824
01:07:29,008 --> 01:07:32,618
Didn't you tell me that Pooja
resembles your own sister-in-law?

825
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:35,970
Just consider that she is in front
of you and is offering it to you.

826
01:07:41,775 --> 01:07:43,166
What will I get, uncle?

827
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:46,259
Yes brother,
give your younger one something too.

828
01:07:46,337 --> 01:07:48,119
What he'll get is some duty.

829
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:52,041
Well, the sister-in-law loves
her brother-in-law the most.

830
01:07:52,298 --> 01:07:55,884
So make sure that she never ever
longs for her maternal home.

831
01:07:56,244 --> 01:07:57,673
- Have you understood?
- Yes, I have understood, uncle.

832
01:07:58,033 --> 01:08:00,610
I promise that I will give my
sister-in-law all the happiness!

833
01:08:01,743 --> 01:08:02,337
Hi, sister-in-law!

834
01:08:02,697 --> 01:08:05,181
- What's happening?
- She's teaching me to speak English.

835
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:07,298
Write, Jawaharlal Nehru.

836
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:10,181
- Should I start Jawaharlal with a J or a D?
- Start with a Z.

837
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:10,767
Yes, yes.

838
01:08:11,386 --> 01:08:14,774
- You are fooling me.
- You fool, does anyone study on Sunday?

839
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:15,247
I do!

840
01:08:15,272 --> 01:08:17,087
- Sister-in-law, let's play cricket.
- No... no.

841
01:08:17,433 --> 01:08:20,087
- She'll not go anywhere.
- Come here.

842
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:20,939
What's the matter?

843
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,914
Chameli, try and explain to him.

844
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:27,737
I've had a tough time getting
brother to agree to play cricket.

845
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:30,243
Have you understood anything, you fool?

846
01:08:31,595 --> 01:08:33,947
Sister-in-law, let's keep the
rest of the studies for tomorrow.

847
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:36,134
Now... it's time to play.

848
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:39,720
- Come, sister-in-law.
- But Prem, I don't know to play cricket.

849
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:41,212
- In that case, you sit and watch.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

850
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:43,617
- There are clouds in the sky...
- Hi, sister-in-law!

851
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:44,087
Hi...

852
01:08:44,946 --> 01:08:46,767
Brother, it's your turn to bat. Let's go!

853
01:08:46,837 --> 01:08:48,353
- Sister-in-law, catch!

854
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:50,296
Let's go, Lalloo!

855
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:00,845
- What's happening?
- Come on, let's play cricket.

856
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,056
You move this side. Field properly.

857
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:06,462
- Are you through with your fielding?
- Take this, big brother.

858
01:09:06,883 --> 01:09:10,579
Hey Prem, at a cricket ground,
there's no permission to only watch.

859
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:14,532
One has to play too.

860
01:09:17,876 --> 01:09:22,697
All right. Sister-in-law,
you will have to bowl. - Me?

861
01:09:22,773 --> 01:09:25,220
- It's a matter of prestige.
- No.

862
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:27,124
It's very easy.
You just have to do this much.

863
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:27,866
That's it!

864
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:30,819
Spectators, a loud round of
applause for our new player.

865
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:32,171
Applause!

866
01:09:32,225 --> 01:09:33,413
Come on!

867
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:37,272
Our new player is moving
towards the bowling crease.

868
01:09:40,187 --> 01:09:42,546
- Welcome, sister-in-law! Best of luck!

869
01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:44,546
Best of luck, sister-in-law!

870
01:09:44,728 --> 01:09:47,280
I guess,
I said something wrong.

871
01:09:51,226 --> 01:09:52,062
Umpire, ready?

872
01:09:59,859 --> 01:10:01,202
- How's that?
- How's that?

873
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:06,850
Our new player has grabbed
the attention of one and all.

874
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:10,530
Off the very first ball,
she has clean bowled a seasoned player.

875
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:13,187
Sister-in-law, it's your turn to bat now.

876
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:16,976
Our new player is moving
towards the batting crease.

877
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,145
Bat, please!

878
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,144
Gloves, please!

879
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:33,572
- Shall we?
- Please!

880
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:36,387
Ball, please.

881
01:10:36,626 --> 01:10:39,215
The match has entered a
very crucial moment now.

882
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,949
Our seasoned player has
rolled back his sleeves.

883
01:10:42,028 --> 01:10:45,676
He is all excited and is out for revenge.

884
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:52,583
LALLOO: Our new player has taken her
position with absolute confidence.

885
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:53,613
Come on, sister-in-law!

886
01:10:53,638 --> 01:10:58,036
The ball has been bowled...
and the ball is racing towards the sky.

887
01:10:58,113 --> 01:11:00,980
It's racing towards the
boundary and... and...

888
01:11:01,005 --> 01:11:02,325
How's that?

889
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:11,777
How's that?

890
01:11:15,879 --> 01:11:17,043
CROWD: No ball!

891
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:23,480
Tuffy, you fool!

892
01:12:02,637 --> 01:12:05,325
"Sister-in-law,
you're the treasure house of happiness!"

893
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:47,215
"From the time the first rays show up..."

894
01:12:47,973 --> 01:12:52,207
"...my sister-in-law is
awake from that time."

895
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:57,543
"She takes care of all and
works till late in the evening."

896
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:01,793
"From the time the first rays show up..."

897
01:13:02,425 --> 01:13:06,598
"...my sister-in-law is
awake from that time."

898
01:13:07,223 --> 01:13:12,262
"I've been missing all
this since childhood!"

899
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,139
"I'll be married too!"

900
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:13,921
"All of them seem to be telling me so."

901
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:19,365
"You make a choice and
don't listen to anyone"

902
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:23,561
"I'll be married too!"

903
01:14:24,196 --> 01:14:28,389
"All of them seem to be telling me so."

904
01:14:29,007 --> 01:14:33,749
"You search for a replica of
yourself and get her here."

905
01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:26,109
"Till when should I be the youngest?"

906
01:15:26,726 --> 01:15:31,070
"Let someone younger than me come too."

907
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:36,265
"Give these arms of mine a
laughing and talking toy!"

908
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:40,507
"Till when should I be the youngest?"

909
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,375
"Let someone younger than me come too."

910
01:15:45,961 --> 01:15:50,469
"We ask of you for a lovely offering!"

911
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:03,086
"Sister-in-law,
you're the treasure house of happiness!"

912
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:27,082
- Come, brother.
- All the work is over.

913
01:16:27,398 --> 01:16:30,196
I've spoken to the confectioner and
have told him about the function...

914
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:33,265
...that we have to celebrate the
arrival of a new member in our family.

915
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:36,289
- Good day, everyone!
- Good day!

916
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:40,828
Uncle, I've brought for you...
fresh and refreshing tea!

917
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:41,719
Very good!

918
01:16:42,172 --> 01:16:43,390
- Please!
- Wow!

919
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,750
Daughter-in-law, you've transformed
Lalloo into an Englishman.

920
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:49,898
Englishman!

921
01:16:50,984 --> 01:16:52,952
How will a monkey appreciate
the taste of ginger?!

922
01:16:56,569 --> 01:16:57,758
Auntie!

923
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,242
This is for you.

924
01:16:59,469 --> 01:17:01,133
- Ginger tea!
- What?

925
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:02,718
Ginger tea, auntie.

926
01:17:04,711 --> 01:17:07,109
Oh, henna problem, no problem.

927
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,672
For you... tea with straw.

928
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:10,914
That's great!

929
01:17:13,808 --> 01:17:16,156
This tea is really good.

930
01:17:16,959 --> 01:17:18,999
But uncle, why are you laughing so much?

931
01:17:19,105 --> 01:17:20,902
Well, call up the professor.

932
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:24,670
I'd like to ask them about their
time of arrival for the function.

933
01:17:30,468 --> 01:17:30,913
Hello!

934
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:37,398
Who?

935
01:17:42,609 --> 01:17:46,851
- You! Tell me.
- Your sister will speak to you.

936
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:47,827
Sister-in-law!

937
01:17:48,132 --> 01:17:50,343
Hello! Hi... Nisha!

938
01:17:50,608 --> 01:17:52,617
Hi, would-be-mother! How are you?

939
01:17:53,203 --> 01:17:54,069
Talk to mom.

940
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:57,281
Hello, Pooja! May you live long, child!

941
01:17:58,312 --> 01:18:01,110
Well, it seems difficult for
us to come for the function.

942
01:18:01,283 --> 01:18:05,148
Seems difficult to come? Talk to uncle.

943
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:09,890
Greetings! What's the matter?

944
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:15,609
His college exams, instead of
being postponed are due these days.

945
01:18:15,854 --> 01:18:17,819
- But at least somebody should come.
- Miss Nisha!

946
01:18:18,242 --> 01:18:20,117
Miss Nisha! Call... Miss Nisha!

947
01:18:20,234 --> 01:18:24,140
- At least, send Nisha.
- Just a second!

948
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:26,445
- Will you go?
- To sister's place? Yes!

949
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:28,913
- Nisha will be coming.
- All right!

950
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,797
Prem will be there
tomorrow to pick up Nisha.

951
01:18:31,235 --> 01:18:32,664
You'll go, right Prem?

952
01:18:34,346 --> 01:18:35,867
Yes, I'll go.

953
01:18:43,336 --> 01:18:45,305
Nisha! Nisha!

954
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:48,511
Get up, child! Get ready, fast. Get up!

955
01:18:53,784 --> 01:18:54,844
What is this, mom?

956
01:18:56,999 --> 01:18:57,961
What a girl you are!

957
01:18:58,711 --> 01:18:59,250
Nisha!

958
01:18:59,594 --> 01:19:01,391
Get up, child.
Prem should be here any moment.

959
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:15,125
Your slave is at your service!

960
01:19:15,991 --> 01:19:17,671
- Hi!
- Hi, Tuffy!

961
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,172
Oh, God! I love her!

962
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,133
Miss Nisha!

963
01:19:28,961 --> 01:19:30,679
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you?

964
01:19:31,187 --> 01:19:34,554
- For what?
- For waiting for me.

965
01:19:34,756 --> 01:19:37,100
I didn't wait for you.

966
01:19:37,358 --> 01:19:40,234
In that case, were you counting
stars in the day on the roof?

967
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:49,867
People say, when a beautiful girl
lies; she looks more beautiful.

968
01:19:53,516 --> 01:19:54,586
MRS. CHOWDHURY: Have you come, son?

969
01:19:54,726 --> 01:19:55,273
Hello, auntie!

970
01:19:58,476 --> 01:20:00,312
How are you, auntie? Where's uncle?

971
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,797
Good morning, son! A special snack.

972
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,992
- Taste it.
- Uncle, have you made it?

973
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,088
Yes, it's your auntie's favorite.

974
01:20:09,758 --> 01:20:13,558
It's a secret. This snack mixed
with butter pleases the wife.

975
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:16,460
Actually, we aren't on talking
terms for the past few days.

976
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:20,123
- Why auntie?
- It's our daughter's first child.

977
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:22,070
It's her baby shower and we're not going!

978
01:20:22,095 --> 01:20:24,867
I'll take you with much fanfare
on the birth of our grand child.

979
01:20:25,169 --> 01:20:28,070
At least, taste it now.
Catch her hand. Taste it.

980
01:20:35,054 --> 01:20:38,351
Can I ask you something?
Why have I got these flowers, today?

981
01:20:38,804 --> 01:20:41,602
Basically, whenever we've
met, we've always fought.

982
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:45,250
Flowers were the best way to
strengthen this acquaintance.

983
01:20:46,476 --> 01:20:50,882
Why did you ask me to forgive you
while leaving after the marriage?

984
01:20:51,045 --> 01:20:52,594
I was just trying to impress you.

985
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,678
- If I tell you the fact, you will laugh.
- I won't. Tell me.

986
01:20:59,156 --> 01:21:02,312
It was that touching moment!
We were taking sister-in-law home.

987
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:04,047
You were bidding her good bye.

988
01:21:04,312 --> 01:21:06,969
Thought to myself,
why not share some of your sorrows.

989
01:21:09,292 --> 01:21:12,586
Saw that, Tuffy?
A genuine man has no value!

990
01:21:14,062 --> 01:21:15,179
I wasn't laughing at you.

991
01:21:16,047 --> 01:21:18,648
Sometimes,
a human errs in judging a person.

992
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:22,117
You aren't the type I thought you
were, when I first met you.

993
01:21:22,234 --> 01:21:23,133
Then...

994
01:21:23,831 --> 01:21:27,790
- ...how am I?
- I'll think of it at leisure and tell you.

995
01:21:28,344 --> 01:21:31,719
There's a surprise for
you in the back seat.

996
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:33,117
Surprise?

997
01:21:33,327 --> 01:21:33,859
Have a look!

998
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:39,576
Chocolates?!

999
01:21:39,836 --> 01:21:40,579
For you.

1000
01:21:41,516 --> 01:21:44,876
What's the matter, Tuffy?
Flowers first, then chocolates!

1001
01:21:45,774 --> 01:21:47,118
Is it some special day?

1002
01:21:47,422 --> 01:21:50,633
For the first time today, a girl is
sitting in the front seat of my car.

1003
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,750
People say that this day
occurs in every person's life.

1004
01:21:56,376 --> 01:21:59,484
Today happens to be
that special day for me.

1005
01:22:03,037 --> 01:22:03,646
Miss Nisha!

1006
01:22:04,295 --> 01:22:04,756
Yes?

1007
01:22:04,898 --> 01:22:06,982
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1008
01:22:08,225 --> 01:22:11,670
I'm sharing my secrets with you
and you're with your comics.

1009
01:22:12,392 --> 01:22:14,360
It's not allowed to read
or write while travelling.

1010
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:17,365
Travel should be full of songs and fun.
What do you say, Tuffy?

1011
01:22:18,155 --> 01:22:23,982
From the time I saw you singing on the
roof, I've become your fan.

1012
01:22:25,311 --> 01:22:27,467
You share some secrets, too.

1013
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:29,834
- I won't tell anyone.
- Some other time.

1014
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:32,599
- Why?
- I've a sore throat.

1015
01:22:33,975 --> 01:22:38,342
Tuffy, before the third comic opens,
I guess I have to impress her.

1016
01:22:43,151 --> 01:22:45,730
"Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven..."

1017
01:22:48,306 --> 01:22:50,728
"Six... Five... Four... Three..."

1018
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:57,360
"Two... One... Let's start the fun!"

1019
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:08,652
"The drapes are flying
in the cold breeze."

1020
01:23:08,677 --> 01:23:14,023
"The heart is beating fast,
it's because of the teen age."

1021
01:23:14,105 --> 01:23:22,097
"No control over the heart...
what sort of magic is this?"

1022
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:34,079
"This the magic of the season, pal!"

1023
01:23:34,587 --> 01:23:38,929
"No control over the heart now, pal!"

1024
01:23:40,095 --> 01:23:44,921
"My gaze has lost and gone insane..."

1025
01:23:44,946 --> 01:23:49,101
"...the sight of you is so breathtaking."

1026
01:23:55,254 --> 01:24:00,426
"This the magic of the season, pal!"

1027
01:24:11,114 --> 01:24:15,909
"This fair girl with the city boy..."

1028
01:24:15,934 --> 01:24:21,098
"...looks like the shining moon!"

1029
01:24:26,638 --> 01:24:29,167
"These beautiful flowers and the buds..."

1030
01:24:29,192 --> 01:24:31,990
"...this naughty call of the wind!"

1031
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,516
"These beautiful flowers and the buds..."

1032
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:42,080
"...this naughty call of the wind!"

1033
01:24:42,105 --> 01:24:47,226
"They signal to me to
spend my time over here."

1034
01:24:47,251 --> 01:24:55,241
"Previously, never ever would
these flowers talk to me this way!"

1035
01:24:57,274 --> 01:25:01,580
"This the magic of the season, pal!"

1036
01:25:02,385 --> 01:25:07,447
"No control over the heart, pal!"

1037
01:25:07,775 --> 01:25:12,735
"My gaze has lost and gone insane..."

1038
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:17,275
"...the sight of you is so breathtaking."

1039
01:25:23,048 --> 01:25:28,681
"This the magic of the season, pal!"

1040
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:04,319
"Tell the truth and
don't keep it a secret."

1041
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:09,789
"From where have you'll come
and where do you want to go?"

1042
01:26:14,826 --> 01:26:20,005
"I'm taking her with me to my place."

1043
01:26:25,153 --> 01:26:30,231
"I'm taking her with me to my place."

1044
01:26:30,278 --> 01:26:35,442
"Well, a strange acquaintance
and a strange place!"

1045
01:26:35,513 --> 01:26:43,513
"Why then have you come so far with
me, my dear?"

1046
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:49,794
"This the magic of the season, pal!"

1047
01:26:50,607 --> 01:26:55,067
"No control over the heart, pal!"

1048
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,884
"My gaze has lost and gone insane..."

1049
01:27:00,909 --> 01:27:05,060
"...the sight of you is so breathtaking."

1050
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:23,323
"This the magic of the season, pal!"

1051
01:27:24,751 --> 01:27:26,845
Big sister.... hi!

1052
01:27:28,064 --> 01:27:29,072
- Nisha!
- Hi!

1053
01:27:29,982 --> 01:27:31,200
Be careful!

1054
01:27:31,391 --> 01:27:32,602
Whoops!

1055
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,505
- Hi, Chameli!
- Miss Nisha!

1056
01:27:35,530 --> 01:27:39,872
- Nisha child... welcome! May you live long!
- Uncle!

1057
01:27:39,997 --> 01:27:41,200
- Hi, Nisha!
- Brother-in-law!

1058
01:27:41,974 --> 01:27:43,021
LALLOO: Good evening, Miss Nisha!

1059
01:27:43,168 --> 01:27:44,903
Oh, my!

1060
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:46,638
Good evening, Mr. Lalloo!

1061
01:27:46,849 --> 01:27:48,435
Miss Nisha, welcome home!

1062
01:27:51,044 --> 01:27:53,622
KAILASHNATH: Daughter-in-law,
the in-laws have sent a lot of things.

1063
01:27:53,655 --> 01:27:56,528
- Mom has sent a letter for you.
- For me?

1064
01:27:56,553 --> 01:27:58,661
Wow, that's great!

1065
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:03,435
'Respected in-law, I
hope, you all are fine.'

1066
01:28:03,731 --> 01:28:05,575
'I was very happy on seeing Prem today.'

1067
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,841
'Do send Rajesh over here, for once.'

1068
01:28:09,786 --> 01:28:12,161
'The professor also
wants to say something.'

1069
01:28:12,278 --> 01:28:13,333
Oh, God!

1070
01:28:14,059 --> 01:28:17,091
'Well Kailashnath,
I've heard that these days you wear dhoti.'

1071
01:28:19,099 --> 01:28:21,583
'Every day, you listen to
daughter-in-law's rendition of Ramayana.'

1072
01:28:21,682 --> 01:28:25,536
'We haven't aged so much.
I'm sending a suit piece for you.'

1073
01:28:25,866 --> 01:28:28,723
'I have stitched a similar one.
You do the same.'

1074
01:28:29,036 --> 01:28:30,739
'On the joyous occasion
of the child's birth...

1075
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,997
...both the grand fathers will
dance in similar outfits.'

1076
01:28:33,106 --> 01:28:33,668
Yes!

1077
01:28:33,919 --> 01:28:35,404
Take this, uncle.

1078
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:39,544
Truly, daughter-in-law,
Nisha's coming has gladdened our hearts.

1079
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:42,770
Tomorrow's function will be
very special now. - Right!

1080
01:28:46,665 --> 01:28:48,730
LALLOO: Welcome! Greetings!

1081
01:28:48,918 --> 01:28:49,918
WOMAN: Greetings!

1082
01:28:50,435 --> 01:28:53,419
I say, this place is decorated
in a different way today.

1083
01:28:53,444 --> 01:28:55,958
It has to be. It's our
daughter-in-law's first function.

1084
01:28:55,983 --> 01:28:57,208
- Right!
- Please, come.

1085
01:28:59,638 --> 01:29:00,919
Greetings! Please, come.

1086
01:29:01,732 --> 01:29:04,747
- Welcome, sister-in-law!
- Not sister-in-law, but my auntie.

1087
01:29:05,161 --> 01:29:06,419
Is that you, Bhagvanti?

1088
01:29:07,286 --> 01:29:10,208
- You look like Pretty Woman, today.

1089
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:11,466
Naughty boy!

1090
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,083
That's great, uncle.

1091
01:29:14,512 --> 01:29:14,776
Shut up!

1092
01:29:14,801 --> 01:29:17,512
Welcome, sister-in-law!
Welcome, elder brother.

1093
01:29:17,599 --> 01:29:19,356
All the guests have arrived.
Bhola has come, too.

1094
01:29:20,348 --> 01:29:22,161
Greetings, brother-in-law!
Greetings, Mr. Prem!

1095
01:29:22,186 --> 01:29:24,301
- When did you come, Mr. Bhola?
- He's here since the afternoon.

1096
01:29:24,326 --> 01:29:26,660
I have struck up a very good
friendship with your brother-in-law.

1097
01:29:26,685 --> 01:29:27,232
Come!

1098
01:29:27,257 --> 01:29:29,848
- Auntie... Oh, oh...
- What happened?

1099
01:29:30,206 --> 01:29:33,339
Wow, you are out to kill today!

1100
01:29:33,364 --> 01:29:34,145
- Really?
- Yes!

1101
01:29:34,216 --> 01:29:37,014
If not for this age difference... today...

1102
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:38,618
Get lost, you shameless creature!

1103
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,247
- Let go of my hand, you rascal!
- Auntie...

1104
01:29:41,272 --> 01:29:41,950
RITA: Prem!

1105
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:43,403
Oh, God! Here she comes!

1106
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,138
- Where did he go?
- Baby, who are these flowers for?

1107
01:29:49,163 --> 01:29:55,005
- They're for sister-in-law.
- Oh, the queen of the flowers has come.

1108
01:30:07,295 --> 01:30:09,795
WOMAN: You look very good today.
Come with us, please.

1109
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:12,209
- Excuse me!
- Shakuntala!

1110
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,791
- You?
- Yes.

1111
01:30:15,859 --> 01:30:18,906
Look, mister!
My name is Rita, not Shakuntala!

1112
01:30:18,931 --> 01:30:21,415
RITA... understand?

1113
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,632
My knowledge of the English
language is a bit weak.

1114
01:30:23,657 --> 01:30:26,085
But whatever you just said,
I found it to be very sweet.

1115
01:30:27,827 --> 01:30:28,553
Stupid!

1116
01:30:30,312 --> 01:30:32,913
Brother, he has found his match.

1117
01:30:32,991 --> 01:30:34,077
- Lalloo!
- Yes?

1118
01:30:34,422 --> 01:30:35,704
Where's my girl?

1119
01:30:39,986 --> 01:30:43,070
'These hours of waiting just
don't seem to get over.'

1120
01:30:43,132 --> 01:30:45,554
Wow! Very beautful!

1121
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:49,398
DOCTOR: These hours of waiting
just don't seem to get over.

1122
01:30:49,539 --> 01:30:52,922
The eyes are longing for
the love of life to appear!

1123
01:30:52,992 --> 01:30:54,805
Wow! Very beautful!

1124
01:30:54,945 --> 01:30:55,405
It was great!

1125
01:30:55,577 --> 01:30:58,355
That poetry suits you perfectly.

1126
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:03,320
DOCTOR: The heart exclaimed,
the moment I saw the glamour of my love...

1127
01:31:03,905 --> 01:31:07,421
The heart exclaimed,
the moment I saw the glamour of my love...

1128
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:10,429
...who has brought her here
from the glory of heaven?!

1129
01:31:10,484 --> 01:31:12,468
Wow! Very beautful!

1130
01:31:12,598 --> 01:31:14,788
- Greetings, doctor uncle!
- May you live long, child!

1131
01:31:15,088 --> 01:31:20,225
Doctor uncle, please repeat the
poetry that you just recited.

1132
01:31:20,655 --> 01:31:23,874
What's the matter, dear?
You seem very poetic today.

1133
01:31:24,226 --> 01:31:26,609
You never appreciated my poetry before.

1134
01:31:26,624 --> 01:31:29,296
Till today, he couldn't fathom
the depths of the poetry.

1135
01:31:29,343 --> 01:31:30,485
I mean, he didn't get it!

1136
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:32,350
What do you say, Miss Nisha...
I mean, brother?

1137
01:31:32,663 --> 01:31:35,429
Doctor uncle, once more please!

1138
01:31:35,499 --> 01:31:36,335
Okay!

1139
01:31:36,444 --> 01:31:39,592
'These hours of waiting just
don't seem to get over.'

1140
01:31:39,693 --> 01:31:42,912
'The eyes are longing for
the love of life to appear!'

1141
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:45,811
'The heart exclaimed,
the moment I saw the glamour of my love...

1142
01:31:48,445 --> 01:31:51,414
...who has brought her here
from the glory of heaven?!'

1143
01:31:51,827 --> 01:31:55,655
Wow! Very beautful!

1144
01:31:55,702 --> 01:31:58,523
Are you all going to pile
on here all the time?

1145
01:31:58,550 --> 01:32:00,444
No, we were just about to leave.

1146
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:01,163
Let's go, doctor!

1147
01:32:01,608 --> 01:32:04,888
Your snacks are ready for
you, on the lawns outside.

1148
01:32:04,913 --> 01:32:07,022
Daughter-in-law is about to come.
We have to start the function.

1149
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,171
Come on, girls!

1150
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:11,968
Shall I come, too?

1151
01:32:12,937 --> 01:32:15,155
Sorry, gents now allowed!

1152
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:24,553
Uncle, is this ladies' program
something great? - Yes.

1153
01:32:25,148 --> 01:32:28,280
- How do you know?
- As a child, I sneaked in and saw it.

1154
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,983
I used to wear a girl's
dress and sit among them.

1155
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,343
What, uncle? Shame!

1156
01:32:35,292 --> 01:32:37,835
You are decent children!

1157
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:42,632
These elders of ours are quite smart!

1158
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,827
- Yes!
- We'd never do something of the sort.

1159
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:49,780
- Shall we go?
- Yes!

1160
01:32:57,014 --> 01:32:59,624
Nisha, you start your program now.

1161
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:07,859
- Auntie!
- Yes?

1162
01:33:12,773 --> 01:33:14,257
Greetings! Greetings!

1163
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,085
Why are you'll sitting over here?

1164
01:33:17,187 --> 01:33:19,952
We wanted to see the program.

1165
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:21,210
- What?
- Bhola wants to see it.

1166
01:33:21,242 --> 01:33:23,359
- Who wants to see?
- Just a minute!

1167
01:33:23,491 --> 01:33:26,702
Bhola, this is a ladies' function.
You go out.

1168
01:33:26,735 --> 01:33:26,976
Yes.

1169
01:33:27,053 --> 01:33:30,467
We'll meet outside... we're going.

1170
01:33:30,492 --> 01:33:33,702
Bhola, you don't get
misled by these two guys.

1171
01:33:34,047 --> 01:33:36,937
They're shameless and will spoil you, too.

1172
01:33:38,024 --> 01:33:40,280
- Why are you laughing?
- Just like that.

1173
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:41,709
Just like that?

1174
01:33:41,734 --> 01:33:43,202
Get out!

1175
01:33:43,227 --> 01:33:45,968
Be careful, auntie!
The waist might get a sprain.

1176
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:46,788
Leave!

1177
01:33:50,171 --> 01:33:51,343
Get out, out!

1178
01:33:55,078 --> 01:33:57,398
Your problems are over.

1179
01:33:59,656 --> 01:34:02,617
Excuse me, excuse me!

1180
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:04,289
What's happening?

1181
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:06,710
You don't bother. You just carry on.

1182
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:08,609
Brother, let's have a close up of auntie.

1183
01:34:08,634 --> 01:34:09,218
What say, auntie?

1184
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,070
Mine? Go right ahead.

1185
01:34:12,335 --> 01:34:14,507
What's this new problem?

1186
01:34:14,812 --> 01:34:19,781
It's such a big function.
They want to capture me on a video.

1187
01:34:20,151 --> 01:34:22,093
Isn't that true, Prem?

1188
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:29,898
I tell you, they don't want to shoot.
I've seen this before.

1189
01:34:30,062 --> 01:34:32,359
They're here to impress the girls.

1190
01:34:33,849 --> 01:34:37,820
- What are you referring to?
- I'll explain. Get me my sandal.

1191
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:38,718
Sandal?!

1192
01:34:39,265 --> 01:34:42,171
All of you guys, get out!

1193
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:46,413
He is a true gentleman.

1194
01:34:47,414 --> 01:34:48,890
All men, out!

1195
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:51,921
Get out!

1196
01:34:52,923 --> 01:34:54,437
Wait! What is it?

1197
01:34:54,576 --> 01:34:55,443
Get out!

1198
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:02,945
What are you up to?

1199
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:06,249
No matter what happens,
I will definitely see the function.

1200
01:35:06,523 --> 01:35:07,195
What's this?!

1201
01:36:02,101 --> 01:36:05,672
"Sister, your brother-in-law is crazy."

1202
01:36:06,259 --> 01:36:10,508
"Sister, your brother-in-law is crazy."

1203
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:14,867
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1204
01:36:14,892 --> 01:36:19,102
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1205
01:36:19,907 --> 01:36:27,871
"It's sort of a habit with him..."
"It's sort of a habit with him."

1206
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:32,421
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1207
01:36:32,523 --> 01:36:37,374
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1208
01:37:26,493 --> 01:37:34,478
"I told him to bring tamarind,
but that fool brought something else."

1209
01:37:39,857 --> 01:37:44,290
"I told him that my heart
desires for something."

1210
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:49,071
"He brought a watermelon when
I asked him to get a lime."

1211
01:37:51,502 --> 01:37:59,466
"He's crazy, somebody guide him"
"He's crazy, somebody guide him."

1212
01:37:59,923 --> 01:38:07,915
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1213
01:38:09,329 --> 01:38:12,836
"Sister, your brother-in-law is crazy."

1214
01:38:13,294 --> 01:38:17,508
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1215
01:39:09,178 --> 01:39:13,606
"I told him to get some mountain mud..."

1216
01:39:13,631 --> 01:39:18,357
"...but that fool got some sweets."

1217
01:39:22,551 --> 01:39:26,981
"I told him to get some sour thing..."

1218
01:39:27,006 --> 01:39:31,709
"...and he got sweets from the market."

1219
01:39:34,092 --> 01:39:42,022
"It's difficult to trap me"
"It's difficult to trap me."

1220
01:39:42,311 --> 01:39:46,724
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1221
01:39:46,749 --> 01:39:50,514
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1222
01:39:51,615 --> 01:39:55,264
"Sister, your brother-in-law is crazy."

1223
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:59,850
"Oh Lord,
he's trying to impress the girls."

1224
01:40:47,228 --> 01:40:50,923
"Sister-in-law, I admire your sister!"

1225
01:40:51,509 --> 01:40:55,329
"Sister-in-law, I admire your sister!"

1226
01:40:55,658 --> 01:41:03,618
"Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" "Oh
Lord, it's the age of girls!"

1227
01:41:04,994 --> 01:41:12,952
"Lord, save me... Lord, save me!"

1228
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:21,393
"Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" "Oh
Lord, it's the age of girls!"

1229
01:41:53,689 --> 01:42:02,880
"It was your command that I
disobeyed, I'm your sinner."

1230
01:42:06,809 --> 01:42:11,317
"I agree to any punishment
that you decide on."

1231
01:42:11,347 --> 01:42:15,965
"When will I be rid of my problem?"

1232
01:42:18,255 --> 01:42:26,219
"I'm tired of my own self"
"I'm tired of my own self."

1233
01:42:26,512 --> 01:42:34,490
"Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" "Oh
Lord, it's the age of girls!"

1234
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:43,215
"Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" "Oh
Lord, it's the age of girls!"

1235
01:42:44,168 --> 01:42:48,841
"Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" "Oh
Lord, it's the age of girls!"

1236
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:56,330
Hello!

1237
01:42:57,955 --> 01:42:59,501
Where were you going?

1238
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:11,088
Do you like this antic of
yours to sneak on girls?

1239
01:43:11,808 --> 01:43:17,002
I just had to see your dance.
Henceforth, I'm a fan of your dance too.

1240
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:23,987
I made so much fun of you.
Didn't you mind?

1241
01:43:25,593 --> 01:43:27,561
These days, I don't mind whatever you do.

1242
01:43:28,494 --> 01:43:30,946
Why? What has happened these days?

1243
01:43:31,057 --> 01:43:32,101
Just...

1244
01:43:32,795 --> 01:43:37,814
Whatever you say,
whatever you do, I like it all!

1245
01:43:41,687 --> 01:43:43,346
Why did you hit me with the missile, then?

1246
01:43:44,901 --> 01:43:45,921
It is bad manners.

1247
01:43:47,114 --> 01:43:50,377
Next time you do that to
someone, think twice.

1248
01:43:51,424 --> 01:43:53,494
I don't have the time to
think of anybody else.

1249
01:43:54,263 --> 01:43:57,232
I can take the liberty of
doing this only with you.

1250
01:43:57,634 --> 01:44:00,510
Why? Who am I to you?

1251
01:44:07,167 --> 01:44:07,674
Shall I tell?

1252
01:44:10,185 --> 01:44:13,494
Well, it's time for the test.
Go right up to the gallows.

1253
01:44:14,409 --> 01:44:16,026
1... 2...

1254
01:44:18,337 --> 01:44:19,869
I hope, no one is watching.

1255
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,999
- What were you saying?
- Nothing, I...

1256
01:44:48,179 --> 01:44:48,805
Hello!

1257
01:44:54,647 --> 01:44:55,249
Darn it!

1258
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:57,648
I love her.

1259
01:44:58,078 --> 01:44:58,687
Yes.

1260
01:44:59,765 --> 01:45:02,859
- Pooja, where's uncle?
- In the study. Why?

1261
01:45:02,984 --> 01:45:04,218
Come over, I'll tell you.

1262
01:45:04,547 --> 01:45:07,406
See this, the fax has just come in
from abroad. -

1263
01:45:07,569 --> 01:45:10,124
The collaborators out there
have liked our new scheme.

1264
01:45:10,157 --> 01:45:11,459
Great, brother! You've done it!

1265
01:45:11,484 --> 01:45:13,539
Brother, is this scheme of that same
factory you are setting up for Prem?

1266
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:15,499
It's all the reward for his hard work.

1267
01:45:15,547 --> 01:45:16,078
Great!

1268
01:45:17,148 --> 01:45:19,554
Pooja, they've called
me there for a few days.

1269
01:45:20,031 --> 01:45:22,164
- Mr. Joshi, please arrange for my departure.
- Yes!

1270
01:45:24,609 --> 01:45:26,367
- Lalloo, are my things ready?
- Yes.

1271
01:45:26,472 --> 01:45:28,109
Sister-in-law is just
packing something to eat.

1272
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:32,976
- This isn't required, Pooja.
- It's already packed. You have to take it.

1273
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:34,874
Brother, you will have to
take this overcoat too.

1274
01:45:35,142 --> 01:45:38,773
Shall we go, Rajesh? - Uncle,
you won't go to the airport so late.

1275
01:45:38,841 --> 01:45:43,226
Why not! Once Tuffy's and my
program is fixed, it stays fixed.

1276
01:45:44,617 --> 01:45:47,227
Well, it will also serve
as an outing for us.

1277
01:45:47,429 --> 01:45:49,859
We're waiting in the car.
It's time for the flight.

1278
01:45:49,944 --> 01:45:50,765
Come on, Tuffy!

1279
01:45:52,687 --> 01:45:54,414
I'm leaving. Take care!

1280
01:46:00,969 --> 01:46:01,797
What's the matter, Prem?

1281
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:06,414
Brother, sister-in-law can
deliver any moment now.

1282
01:46:07,391 --> 01:46:09,359
Right now, she needs you the most.

1283
01:46:10,902 --> 01:46:14,125
At such a crucial juncture,
leaving her alone...

1284
01:46:15,868 --> 01:46:17,539
...you have to go abroad for my sake.

1285
01:46:18,067 --> 01:46:21,227
So, that's the case. Come with me.

1286
01:46:22,344 --> 01:46:25,460
Pooja, just listen to what
your brother-in-law has to say.

1287
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:26,875
What's the matter, Prem?

1288
01:46:29,467 --> 01:46:32,766
- What's the matter?
- He says that the delivery is imminent.

1289
01:46:33,332 --> 01:46:36,453
He says that at this stage
I have to go abroad for him.

1290
01:46:39,881 --> 01:46:45,133
Prem, along with uncle,
we all too have a dream.

1291
01:46:46,374 --> 01:46:49,695
That you prosper and make a
name for yourself in this world.

1292
01:46:50,864 --> 01:46:53,296
Your brother is going
to fulfil this dream.

1293
01:46:54,999 --> 01:47:00,960
As far as I'm concerned,
when you're here, do I need to worry?

1294
01:47:03,086 --> 01:47:05,765
Is there any other friend greater than
a brother-in-law for his sister-in-law?

1295
01:47:12,517 --> 01:47:13,294
Come on, brother!

1296
01:47:20,471 --> 01:47:23,817
I really enjoyed the food
that you cooked, Nisha.

1297
01:47:24,117 --> 01:47:28,075
It's amazing! Both the sisters are similar.
Full of good values!

1298
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:29,130
Be happy!

1299
01:47:29,754 --> 01:47:31,942
Daughter-in-law, it's been quite
some time that Rajesh has gone.

1300
01:47:32,352 --> 01:47:33,404
Is there any news about his return?

1301
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:36,122
I just spoke to him today.
The work is almost over.

1302
01:47:36,464 --> 01:47:37,677
In that case, he must be coming soon.

1303
01:47:37,763 --> 01:47:41,449
- Well, I have given him a list.
- Wow!

1304
01:47:41,489 --> 01:47:44,287
He's gone to work over there and
you've given him a list of nail polish.

1305
01:47:44,461 --> 01:47:47,005
What's the harm?
After all, he's my loving nephew.

1306
01:47:47,058 --> 01:47:48,184
You love him a lot!

1307
01:47:48,277 --> 01:47:49,573
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1308
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:52,191
I understand everything
that you mumble to yourself.

1309
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,278
Don't consider me to be a fool.

1310
01:47:53,318 --> 01:47:55,208
Auntie, some Aniseed.

1311
01:47:55,271 --> 01:47:55,981
Thank you.

1312
01:47:57,005 --> 01:48:00,964
Okay bye daughter-in-law, brother...
You come over.

1313
01:48:03,098 --> 01:48:08,192
Thanks for saving me.
She was about to start the third world war.

1314
01:48:10,066 --> 01:48:11,458
I'm leaving, too.

1315
01:48:11,497 --> 01:48:12,083
Good night, everybody!

1316
01:48:12,108 --> 01:48:12,764
- Good night!
- Good night!

1317
01:48:13,286 --> 01:48:16,896
Daughter-in-law, you rest too.
It's quite late.

1318
01:48:17,287 --> 01:48:19,794
Well uncle, Prem should be
back from the office soon.

1319
01:48:19,999 --> 01:48:25,122
He's busy with his work. He's taken
over all of Rajesh's responsibility.

1320
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:29,044
He might be late. Chameli,
take daughter-in-law to her room. - Yes.

1321
01:48:29,586 --> 01:48:33,231
Nisha, please call Prem at the office.
Ask him, when he's coming.

1322
01:48:44,724 --> 01:48:48,138
This service station... shift it to no.
10 block... -

1323
01:48:48,677 --> 01:48:49,044
Excuse me!

1324
01:48:50,999 --> 01:48:51,434
Hello!

1325
01:48:54,248 --> 01:48:54,740
Who?

1326
01:48:57,443 --> 01:48:57,935
Tell me!

1327
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:01,653
Your sister-in-law is enquiring
as to when you would be back.

1328
01:49:02,747 --> 01:49:05,466
I'll be late. Tell sister-in-law to rest.

1329
01:49:05,716 --> 01:49:07,494
Tell Lalloo to keep the food ready for me.

1330
01:49:07,617 --> 01:49:09,536
As for you, thank you for calling!

1331
01:49:15,762 --> 01:49:18,247
Yes, Mr. Ramnathan, Mr. D'Souza...
let's continue!

1332
01:49:18,884 --> 01:49:19,872
It was my mom's phone.

1333
01:49:22,724 --> 01:49:23,357
Sorry, guys!

1334
01:49:23,646 --> 01:49:24,685
No messing around during work time.

1335
01:49:25,059 --> 01:49:26,950
Plot no. 10 has got to
be at service station.

1336
01:49:27,017 --> 01:49:28,192
LALLOO: This is my home.

1337
01:49:28,505 --> 01:49:30,896
- My home is very beautiful.
- Lalloo!

1338
01:49:31,481 --> 01:49:33,294
Have you come, brother?

1339
01:49:33,329 --> 01:49:36,403
Got very late today. Has sister-in-law
gone to sleep? - A long time back.

1340
01:49:36,747 --> 01:49:37,521
Good!

1341
01:49:37,818 --> 01:49:41,270
- Shall I serve the food?
- Yes, do it fast! I'm very hungry.

1342
01:49:41,372 --> 01:49:42,286
I'll do it, right away.

1343
01:49:42,544 --> 01:49:43,693
Miss Nisha!

1344
01:49:50,279 --> 01:49:52,575
I'll go in and reheat the food.

1345
01:50:01,473 --> 01:50:02,482
You're awake so late?

1346
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,435
Why are you awake so late?

1347
01:50:06,871 --> 01:50:07,427
Your food.

1348
01:50:13,219 --> 01:50:14,708
From where should I start?

1349
01:50:16,403 --> 01:50:18,732
You take so much time to
select the vegetables.

1350
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,122
Wonder how you work in the office!

1351
01:50:22,622 --> 01:50:23,701
Start from here.

1352
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:25,818
Your favorite sweet.

1353
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,528
How do you know that this is my favorite?

1354
01:50:30,099 --> 01:50:32,911
Here are some piping hot
'parathas '.

1355
01:50:33,607 --> 01:50:34,896
So it was you who told her
about my liking for this sweet.

1356
01:50:35,570 --> 01:50:40,239
If someone asks me about your
likes, I have to be truthful.

1357
01:50:40,949 --> 01:50:42,676
She has done the cooking today.

1358
01:50:42,794 --> 01:50:43,185
You have?

1359
01:50:43,352 --> 01:50:44,974
It's fantastic. Just taste it.

1360
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,208
I'm feeling sleepy. I'm going.

1361
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:51,162
Let's go, Tuffy! Time to sleep.

1362
01:50:51,740 --> 01:50:54,239
Why interfere? You fool! Good night!

1363
01:50:56,903 --> 01:50:58,507
There's magic in your hands.

1364
01:50:59,165 --> 01:51:02,880
It's the first time that I taste
such tasty sweet. It's the truth.

1365
01:51:04,099 --> 01:51:05,685
You might consider me to be a fool.

1366
01:51:06,415 --> 01:51:10,083
I'm a fan of your singing,
your dancing and now...

1367
01:51:11,232 --> 01:51:12,708
...l'm a fan of your cooking too.

1368
01:51:25,167 --> 01:51:25,737
Miss Nisha!

1369
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:29,150
You haven't answered my question.

1370
01:51:32,649 --> 01:51:34,112
Why were you awake for me?

1371
01:51:35,501 --> 01:51:37,128
Do you know about your drawback?

1372
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:40,291
You talk a lot while eating.

1373
01:51:40,713 --> 01:51:43,627
Oh, really? Is that so? I'm sorry!

1374
01:51:49,444 --> 01:51:54,221
You have a weakness, too.
You believe in everything very soon.

1375
01:52:01,573 --> 01:52:05,362
You are unbelievable!
When I want to ask you something...

1376
01:52:06,198 --> 01:52:10,635
...you stop me and when I'm
quiet, you criticize me.

1377
01:52:13,431 --> 01:52:14,635
Shall I ask you something?

1378
01:52:17,307 --> 01:52:18,284
Who am I to you?

1379
01:53:12,368 --> 01:53:20,123
"It's the first love...
it's the first time."

1380
01:53:21,377 --> 01:53:29,157
"It's the first love...
it's the first time."

1381
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:37,263
"In spite of knowing this,
my love acts so strange!"

1382
01:53:39,253 --> 01:53:47,191
"It's the first love..."
it's the first time."

1383
01:54:16,769 --> 01:54:25,753
"Her looks... look at me
from the corner of her eyes."

1384
01:54:25,778 --> 01:54:33,433
"Her looks... her shyness..."

1385
01:54:35,152 --> 01:54:42,120
"...they reveal the secret of her liking...
her shyness."

1386
01:54:44,027 --> 01:54:51,064
"One who will serve without being noticed...
my love is that type!"

1387
01:54:53,040 --> 01:55:00,501
"It's the first love...
it's the first time."

1388
01:55:37,138 --> 01:55:45,955
"She is Nisha...
she is the direction of my life."

1389
01:55:46,204 --> 01:55:53,149
"She is Nisha... she knows..."

1390
01:55:55,587 --> 01:56:02,550
"...that she controls my life...
she knows that."

1391
01:56:04,384 --> 01:56:12,348
"My love is cut off from the whole world!"

1392
01:56:13,465 --> 01:56:21,429
"It's the first love...
it's the first time."

1393
01:56:22,372 --> 01:56:30,372
"It's the first love...
it's the first time"

1394
01:57:00,355 --> 01:57:01,306
Somebody is coming.

1395
01:57:09,403 --> 01:57:11,371
- Brother!
- What's the matter, Chameli?

1396
01:57:12,335 --> 01:57:14,680
Please, call doctor auntie.

1397
01:57:14,902 --> 01:57:17,263
We might have to shift
sister-in-law to the hospital.

1398
01:57:30,063 --> 01:57:31,430
Congratulations! It's our grandson.

1399
01:57:31,463 --> 01:57:34,008
Uncle, I'm an uncle now!

1400
01:57:40,469 --> 01:57:42,118
Congratulations! Congratulations!

1401
01:58:25,123 --> 01:58:27,451
"Everyone will have to sing today."

1402
01:58:45,709 --> 01:58:49,668
"Sister-in-law, I thank you."

1403
01:58:50,357 --> 01:58:54,576
"Let's all get together and thank her."

1404
01:58:55,319 --> 01:58:59,670
"My eyes were longing for this
sight, my dreams have come true!"

1405
01:58:59,695 --> 01:59:04,631
"God willing,
you too may have a poetic attitude!"

1406
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:16,318
"Childhood days have returned!"

1407
01:59:43,653 --> 01:59:51,628
"This mute animal too is
happy knowing that..."

1408
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:57,650
"...there'll be a lovely sound
echoing around this lawn now."

1409
01:59:57,675 --> 02:00:02,399
"Tuffy is asking the child
to keep on smiling always!"

1410
02:00:20,471 --> 02:00:21,291
"Sing it!"

1411
02:00:25,588 --> 02:00:28,027
"Grandma and grandpa will dance too!"

1412
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:09,049
"Listen to what the kid is saying."

1413
02:01:09,638 --> 02:01:13,217
"He's asking you to be
closely related to him."

1414
02:01:14,521 --> 02:01:18,950
"Son, this uncle of yours
is up to something."

1415
02:01:18,975 --> 02:01:23,592
"If I don't get you, I'm sure to
renounce life and become a priest."

1416
02:01:33,076 --> 02:01:35,412
"Come home and take the alms."

1417
02:01:54,011 --> 02:01:56,566
"My dear!"

1418
02:01:56,651 --> 02:02:01,683
"Live long, child.
The child is very lucky."

1419
02:02:28,248 --> 02:02:32,178
"These fireworks... this brightness."

1420
02:02:32,912 --> 02:02:36,967
"They reveal the happiness of the heart!"

1421
02:02:37,807 --> 02:02:42,085
"The earth and the sky
are happy for our baby."

1422
02:02:42,119 --> 02:02:46,951
"And it's apt that at such time,
the father of the child arrives."

1423
02:03:23,027 --> 02:03:25,551
- Dad, this is the model of Prem's factory.
- Wow!

1424
02:03:26,188 --> 02:03:28,089
Kailashnath,
you started from just a small room.

1425
02:03:28,559 --> 02:03:30,387
Rajesh has striven to reach this stage.

1426
02:03:30,691 --> 02:03:33,434
And now, Prem will make sure
that he does his bit for success.

1427
02:03:33,557 --> 02:03:37,003
Prem, give it your best shot.
We won't be here for the inauguration.

1428
02:03:37,129 --> 02:03:39,339
- Where are you going, uncle?
- We're going back home.

1429
02:03:39,843 --> 02:03:41,137
We have the tickets for the evening train.

1430
02:03:41,162 --> 02:03:43,676
Are you'll leaving today?

1431
02:03:44,949 --> 02:03:47,090
We were waiting for Rajesh to come back.

1432
02:03:47,348 --> 02:03:49,207
Now, we'll be leaving.

1433
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,856
Brother, think, stop them.

1434
02:03:57,949 --> 02:04:01,198
Prem, what is this that I'm hearing?
Is the professor going?

1435
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:03,004
Yes. They're leaving today.

1436
02:04:03,324 --> 02:04:04,145
- Today?
- Yes.

1437
02:04:04,208 --> 02:04:06,130
Brother, will you listen please?

1438
02:04:07,723 --> 02:04:09,956
- Didn't you tell them to stay?
- He didn't.

1439
02:04:09,981 --> 02:04:12,262
They've got tickets
reserved for the evening.

1440
02:04:12,287 --> 02:04:14,405
The tickets can be cancelled.

1441
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:15,832
Forget him. I'll see how they leave.

1442
02:04:15,857 --> 02:04:17,410
- Uncle, you're so sweet!
- Doctor!

1443
02:04:17,674 --> 02:04:18,574
You stay put.

1444
02:04:18,623 --> 02:04:19,605
- Prem...
- Sir...

1445
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:20,199
The paper.

1446
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,059
Welcome, doctor!

1447
02:04:25,309 --> 02:04:27,019
Are you all set to leave, professor?

1448
02:04:27,044 --> 02:04:29,893
Yes. I enjoyed your
company all these days.

1449
02:04:29,918 --> 02:04:32,019
Sister-in-law,
can I have a look at your tickets?

1450
02:04:33,488 --> 02:04:35,065
- Lalloo, get them cancelled.
- Cancel?

1451
02:04:35,066 --> 02:04:39,285
You're impossible! Your son-in-law
has just come and you're leaving?

1452
02:04:40,277 --> 02:04:42,932
I had a mind to stay for 4-5 months but...

1453
02:04:42,957 --> 02:04:45,481
What are you saying?
It's our daughter's in-law's place.

1454
02:04:45,585 --> 02:04:49,738
It's our daughter's in-law's place
now, but it's my friend's house always.

1455
02:04:50,152 --> 02:04:53,253
You may be angry,
but we won't let you go today.

1456
02:04:54,184 --> 02:04:56,769
- Spend some time with Rajesh, too.
- Yes!

1457
02:04:56,910 --> 02:04:58,551
Stay, please!

1458
02:04:58,849 --> 02:05:00,469
Mom, please stay.

1459
02:05:01,121 --> 02:05:03,582
- But...
- Mom... please!

1460
02:05:04,793 --> 02:05:05,097
All right!

1461
02:05:08,539 --> 02:05:10,145
I will take care of this thing.

1462
02:05:13,301 --> 02:05:15,378
Just a minute!
We'll stay on one condition.

1463
02:05:15,637 --> 02:05:17,614
- What's that?
- Nobody will sleep tonight.

1464
02:05:17,902 --> 02:05:20,254
We'll have a night of
merriment among friends.

1465
02:05:21,809 --> 02:05:24,933
You just wait and watch the fun.

1466
02:05:25,558 --> 02:05:27,199
It'll be out of this world.

1467
02:05:27,621 --> 02:05:30,261
DOCTOR: This night is truly happy...

1468
02:05:30,457 --> 02:05:34,502
This is a fantastic gathering.

1469
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:37,121
Stop this poetry now and get
into the mood of the game.

1470
02:05:37,161 --> 02:05:39,425
Son, for how long will we
continue sitting over here?

1471
02:05:39,464 --> 02:05:40,738
What do we have to do?

1472
02:05:40,817 --> 02:05:44,003
It'll be fun. It's a very easy game.

1473
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:46,488
We will be playing the music.

1474
02:05:46,576 --> 02:05:48,162
This pillow will be passed around.

1475
02:05:48,297 --> 02:05:51,261
Whenever the music stops,
whoever has this pillow is a goner.

1476
02:05:51,465 --> 02:05:54,168
We will punish that person in
any which way that we desire.

1477
02:05:54,324 --> 02:05:56,098
- Okay?
- Okay!

1478
02:05:56,123 --> 02:06:01,504
Where are you going?
We want to trap you first of all.

1479
02:06:01,529 --> 02:06:06,941
I'm not the type to be trapped.
I'll sit and watch and ensure fair play.

1480
02:06:07,722 --> 02:06:09,550
I will check you out.

1481
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:11,496
What a style!

1482
02:06:23,642 --> 02:06:26,611
Professor, my dad used to
play the gramophone for us.

1483
02:06:26,702 --> 02:06:29,293
- Do you remember the song?
- Thanks, child.

1484
02:06:29,464 --> 02:06:32,785
"One mansion needs to be made" - Yes!

1485
02:06:32,810 --> 02:06:35,369
"One mansion needs to be made"

1486
02:06:37,202 --> 02:06:38,932
Brother Prem, should I start?

1487
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:40,479
Yes, start!

1488
02:06:50,236 --> 02:06:53,736
"Your black hair, your golden complexion."

1489
02:06:53,791 --> 02:06:57,368
"Your youth... my, oh my!"

1490
02:06:57,634 --> 02:07:03,923
"Sweetheart, sweetheart!"

1491
02:07:04,393 --> 02:07:07,127
Hey, Lalloo out!

1492
02:07:07,729 --> 02:07:09,501
- But...
- Stand up!

1493
02:07:09,633 --> 02:07:10,462
Get up!

1494
02:07:12,119 --> 02:07:13,861
I'll go and fill the water.

1495
02:07:15,075 --> 02:07:16,191
What should I do?

1496
02:07:16,351 --> 02:07:18,908
Your sister-in-law has taught you
to speak in English. Say something.

1497
02:07:19,486 --> 02:07:19,973
Just a minute!

1498
02:07:27,071 --> 02:07:29,689
Jawaharlal Nehru was born
on 14th November, 1889.

1499
02:07:29,931 --> 02:07:32,994
He was our first Prime Minister.
He loved children very much.

1500
02:07:33,143 --> 02:07:36,236
Children used to say,
"Long live uncle Nehru!" Victory to India!

1501
02:07:36,298 --> 02:07:37,197
PREM: Claps!

1502
02:07:42,314 --> 02:07:45,955
"Your laughing, lustrous face."

1503
02:07:46,025 --> 02:07:49,780
"Your black hair, your golden complexion."

1504
02:07:49,897 --> 02:07:53,467
"Your youth... my, oh my!"

1505
02:07:53,501 --> 02:07:58,532
"Sweetheart, sweetheart!"

1506
02:07:59,785 --> 02:08:00,527
Brother, you're caught.

1507
02:08:01,238 --> 02:08:04,847
- What should we ask him to do?
- I won't do a thing.

1508
02:08:05,034 --> 02:08:06,885
- Hey, why's that?
- No, no...

1509
02:08:06,948 --> 02:08:08,407
- This isn't fair.
- No way!

1510
02:08:09,157 --> 02:08:11,282
- Don't be a spoil sport.
- Yes, brother!

1511
02:08:12,348 --> 02:08:13,746
- All right!
- Start!

1512
02:08:14,959 --> 02:08:16,314
I will say something in your praise.

1513
02:08:21,215 --> 02:08:23,793
'Her complexion may be fair or dark...

1514
02:08:24,434 --> 02:08:27,050
...lucky is the brother-in-law
whose wife has a sister!'

1515
02:08:27,082 --> 02:08:27,893
Oh!

1516
02:08:31,152 --> 02:08:34,777
Please, proceed. - 'One whose wife
has a sister is a blessed man.'

1517
02:08:35,416 --> 02:08:39,216
'An eye on the wife's sister
and the wife for company.'

1518
02:08:40,129 --> 02:08:43,098
- Are you listening, daughter-in-law?
- Yes, I am.

1519
02:08:46,356 --> 02:08:50,569
'The poet has rightly said that
nectar is full of goodness...

1520
02:08:50,594 --> 02:08:53,230
...and that the wife's sister
is almost like a wife.'

1521
02:09:14,202 --> 02:09:16,873
- What's this?
- He was out, but he didn't take it.

1522
02:09:17,873 --> 02:09:19,512
Are you watching, your honour?

1523
02:09:20,035 --> 02:09:21,566
Sister-in-law, no cheating!

1524
02:09:21,621 --> 02:09:23,652
No cheating!

1525
02:09:23,699 --> 02:09:26,668
Dad... 'Mughal-E-Azam !'

1526
02:09:27,732 --> 02:09:28,855
KAILASHNATH: What's Mughal-E-Azam?

1527
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:31,699
Who are you watching? Son-in-law?

1528
02:09:31,934 --> 02:09:33,067
Why feel shy in front of your son?

1529
02:09:34,291 --> 02:09:37,339
Dear in-law... let us hear.

1530
02:09:39,457 --> 02:09:42,473
Lights off!

1531
02:09:43,574 --> 02:09:44,152
PROF. CHOWDHURY: Anarkali!

1532
02:09:44,190 --> 02:09:45,996
KAILASHNATH: Hey professor, over here.

1533
02:09:49,559 --> 02:09:52,777
So, what did Anarkali say to Prince Salim?

1534
02:09:55,322 --> 02:10:00,543
Your honour, the sunlight brightens
up all the gardens of the world.

1535
02:10:01,992 --> 02:10:03,746
Why then, did the Sun take the trouble?

1536
02:10:05,551 --> 02:10:08,261
My dear prince,
don't rob the dreams from my eyes.

1537
02:10:09,836 --> 02:10:10,793
I'll die!

1538
02:10:20,538 --> 02:10:24,937
"First your eyes robbed me from afar."

1539
02:10:24,962 --> 02:10:28,587
"Now you look upon this
injustice with pride."

1540
02:10:28,955 --> 02:10:34,033
"Oh crazy one, oh crazy one...
what do you know?"

1541
02:10:34,058 --> 02:10:35,517
"Yes, what do you know?"

1542
02:10:35,557 --> 02:10:38,182
"What my heart's restlessness is like..."

1543
02:10:44,156 --> 02:10:45,687
The time has finally
arrived to do something.

1544
02:10:45,738 --> 02:10:47,578
One... two...

1545
02:10:49,406 --> 02:10:52,593
Lalloo, give me that chair and the bottle.

1546
02:10:52,812 --> 02:10:54,945
Kailashnath brother, move aside!

1547
02:10:55,031 --> 02:10:56,914
Listen, what are you doing?

1548
02:10:57,265 --> 02:11:00,054
I've lost already,
I may as well do it with style.

1549
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:01,531
Thank you. Thank you for the chair.

1550
02:11:09,281 --> 02:11:12,180
Film, Sholay! Dharmendra, drunk scene...

1551
02:11:13,242 --> 02:11:14,414
Auntie!

1552
02:11:20,437 --> 02:11:21,586
Auntie!

1553
02:11:21,611 --> 02:11:22,900
You're great, Mr. Dharmendra!

1554
02:11:26,641 --> 02:11:28,891
Villagers...

1555
02:11:31,332 --> 02:11:36,292
Villagers, this Basanti...

1556
02:11:36,952 --> 02:11:39,671
I was supposed to get married to her.

1557
02:11:41,033 --> 02:11:44,992
- But this old auntie...
- What did I do?

1558
02:11:45,225 --> 02:11:51,257
Villagers, if I don't get
married, then... suicide.

1559
02:11:51,668 --> 02:11:53,320
And then, all of you would be behind bars.

1560
02:11:53,345 --> 02:11:57,007
Churning the flour mill,
churning, churning...

1561
02:11:57,628 --> 02:11:59,969
I'm ready! Now, please step down.

1562
02:12:00,008 --> 02:12:06,062
Should I? Villagers,
auntie has agreed and so has my Basanti.

1563
02:12:06,875 --> 02:12:12,859
So... so...
the program of dying is cancelled.

1564
02:12:13,429 --> 02:12:14,296
Great!

1565
02:12:20,562 --> 02:12:23,969
"Your black hair, your golden complexion."

1566
02:12:23,994 --> 02:12:28,063
"Your youth... my, oh my!"

1567
02:12:28,234 --> 02:12:34,952
"Sweetheart, sweetheart!"

1568
02:12:40,422 --> 02:12:41,937
After his excellent show, what can I do?

1569
02:12:41,962 --> 02:12:43,211
Uncle, Michael Jackson!

1570
02:12:43,667 --> 02:12:45,187
You'll get a slap.

1571
02:12:45,305 --> 02:12:45,773
Why?

1572
02:12:45,798 --> 02:12:47,273
Uncle, whatever suits you.

1573
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:48,258
Yes, uncle!

1574
02:12:49,266 --> 02:12:49,953
Good!

1575
02:12:51,219 --> 02:12:53,625
'No matter if the world is our enemy...

1576
02:12:54,333 --> 02:12:56,891
...may this friendship
of ours be forever!'

1577
02:12:59,609 --> 02:13:04,210
'We won't separate even after death,
we have the promise of friendship.'

1578
02:13:04,848 --> 02:13:06,929
'If someone asks us for our address...

1579
02:13:07,429 --> 02:13:09,359
...we say, we stay in each other's heart.'

1580
02:13:09,976 --> 02:13:14,804
'We don't have any other place.
May this friendship be forever!'

1581
02:13:14,843 --> 02:13:15,406
Great!

1582
02:13:17,734 --> 02:13:19,398
It seems to be my turn now.

1583
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:21,453
My blood pressure is going up!

1584
02:13:21,484 --> 02:13:22,281
140!

1585
02:13:22,398 --> 02:13:24,664
160... 180... 200!

1586
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:27,268
Heart fail!

1587
02:13:27,476 --> 02:13:31,335
What are you talking, doctor?
You're a strong man!

1588
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:33,492
Let's hear something out of this world.

1589
02:13:34,773 --> 02:13:38,258
- What do you mean?
- Recite some other poet's poetry.

1590
02:13:39,552 --> 02:13:42,804
That would be the worst
punishment for a poet.

1591
02:13:42,852 --> 02:13:45,047
Brother!

1592
02:13:46,449 --> 02:13:50,408
"I am not... a poet..."

1593
02:13:51,814 --> 02:13:55,257
"...but, oh my beautiful..."

1594
02:13:55,727 --> 02:13:59,764
"...from the time I set my eyes on you..."

1595
02:13:59,789 --> 02:14:02,609
"...I got hooked on to poetry!"

1596
02:14:04,727 --> 02:14:06,695
That was great, doctor!

1597
02:14:07,445 --> 02:14:10,243
Well, Prem and Nisha,
only the two of you are left now.

1598
02:14:10,471 --> 02:14:12,268
Let's see who the winner is.

1599
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:13,906
Bhola, start the music.

1600
02:14:21,352 --> 02:14:25,266
"Torture me and strike me
to your heart's content."

1601
02:14:25,297 --> 02:14:28,844
"It's all bearable,
just love me a little."

1602
02:14:28,875 --> 02:14:32,272
"You are in my heart,
oh you are in my heart."

1603
02:14:32,352 --> 02:14:35,641
"My heart is in trouble,
oh my heart is in trouble."

1604
02:14:35,666 --> 02:14:37,844
"Now don't you multiply
my heart's troubles."

1605
02:14:40,781 --> 02:14:42,679
Thanks a lot!

1606
02:14:42,704 --> 02:14:45,781
- That's great, you've won.
- He has cheated.

1607
02:14:46,014 --> 02:14:47,984
- What did I do?
- What did he do?

1608
02:14:48,156 --> 02:14:48,703
He...

1609
02:14:51,707 --> 02:14:52,434
What do I have to do?

1610
02:14:55,301 --> 02:14:58,074
What are you asking her to do?

1611
02:14:58,910 --> 02:15:01,793
Ask her to tell us some
dialogues from a film.

1612
02:15:02,115 --> 02:15:04,083
Tell her to imitate a song from any film.

1613
02:15:04,314 --> 02:15:08,273
Why the imitation?
Let her do something original.

1614
02:15:16,458 --> 02:15:19,637
Do it, Nisha. It would be fun.

1615
02:15:19,832 --> 02:15:22,074
Come on, do it!

1616
02:15:22,598 --> 02:15:24,637
MRS. DOCTOR: Let's hear! - DOCTOR: Great!

1617
02:16:11,109 --> 02:16:16,609
"O mother, the crow on your
roof foretells that..."

1618
02:16:19,343 --> 02:16:24,500
"O mother, the crow on your
roof foretells that..."

1619
02:16:24,868 --> 02:16:27,608
"...your darling daughter
has renounced this house..."

1620
02:16:27,633 --> 02:16:29,812
"...and has fallen in
love with a stranger!"

1621
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:46,374
"O mother, the crow on your
roof foretells that..."

1622
02:16:46,921 --> 02:16:49,616
"...your darling daughter
has renounced this house..."

1623
02:16:49,641 --> 02:16:51,819
"...and has fallen in love with a sage!"

1624
02:17:03,467 --> 02:17:06,198
"The fireworks are sizzling."

1625
02:17:06,248 --> 02:17:08,919
"The drumbeats are my messengers."

1626
02:17:08,994 --> 02:17:11,724
"The fireworks are sizzling."

1627
02:17:11,749 --> 02:17:14,310
"The drumbeats are my messengers."

1628
02:17:25,513 --> 02:17:30,613
"That sage was illuminated
like the moon..."

1629
02:17:31,004 --> 02:17:35,839
"...he came to my door
and proclaimed his love!"

1630
02:17:36,511 --> 02:17:39,597
"Having rubbed ashes on his body..."

1631
02:17:42,066 --> 02:17:44,808
"...having rubbed ashes on his body..."

1632
02:17:44,833 --> 02:17:47,214
"...he remained awake the whole night."

1633
02:17:47,590 --> 02:17:50,254
"Your darling daughter has
renounced this house..."

1634
02:17:50,286 --> 02:17:52,565
"...and has fallen in love with a sage!"

1635
02:18:09,504 --> 02:18:11,953
"Listen, O Darling! Dance, O Darling!"

1636
02:18:11,985 --> 02:18:14,985
"Dance and colour this atmosphere."

1637
02:18:15,010 --> 02:18:17,789
"Listen, O Darling! Dance, O Darling!"

1638
02:18:17,814 --> 02:18:19,906
"Dance and colour this atmosphere."

1639
02:18:31,532 --> 02:18:36,704
"You had taken a religious
vow for my wedding..."

1640
02:18:37,071 --> 02:18:42,016
"...now you should get me
engaged with that sage."

1641
02:18:42,582 --> 02:18:46,048
"Apply henna on these hands."

1642
02:18:48,111 --> 02:18:50,837
"Apply henna on these hands..."

1643
02:18:50,862 --> 02:18:53,251
"...and tie the auspicious
thread of the ritual."

1644
02:18:53,643 --> 02:18:56,171
"Your darling daughter has
renounced this house..."

1645
02:18:56,196 --> 02:18:58,866
"...and has fallen in love with a sage!"

1646
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:09,851
"O mother, the crow on your
roof foretells that..."

1647
02:19:10,242 --> 02:19:12,946
"...your darling daughter
has renounced this house..."

1648
02:19:12,971 --> 02:19:15,992
"...and has fallen in
love with a stranger!"

1649
02:19:37,602 --> 02:19:39,679
Sister-in-law, we have a complaint.

1650
02:19:39,899 --> 02:19:43,406
You were here for so long but
never came over to our place.

1651
02:19:43,472 --> 02:19:45,828
- My dear, when did you call?
- You better be quiet!

1652
02:19:46,242 --> 02:19:47,811
Do we have to invite our own?

1653
02:19:47,889 --> 02:19:50,858
You're right. Sister-in-law,
we promise to come the next time.

1654
02:19:50,976 --> 02:19:53,942
Shall we go, now?
It's time for the train to leave.

1655
02:19:53,967 --> 02:19:55,327
But my in-law is not to be spotted.

1656
02:19:55,353 --> 02:19:58,959
What's the rush?
I wanted to bid you all a proper farewell.

1657
02:19:59,366 --> 02:20:00,561
- Nisha!
- Nisha!

1658
02:20:00,967 --> 02:20:01,366
Daughter-in-law!

1659
02:20:03,092 --> 02:20:03,725
This is for you.

1660
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:05,077
But what about our gift?

1661
02:20:06,303 --> 02:20:06,983
Hey, it's okay!

1662
02:20:08,355 --> 02:20:11,248
Dear in-law, this heart is so crazy.

1663
02:20:12,396 --> 02:20:15,694
Whatever it gets, it always expects more!

1664
02:20:16,428 --> 02:20:18,061
The other day, we stopped you all.

1665
02:20:18,938 --> 02:20:21,733
Now, the heart once again desires
to stop you all for a day.

1666
02:20:25,647 --> 02:20:29,584
Brother, please do me a favour.
I want a photo with Nisha.

1667
02:20:30,241 --> 02:20:33,600
That would be a remembrance
of her loving stay with us.

1668
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:37,584
- Sir, one photo for us too.
- Me too!

1669
02:20:37,609 --> 02:20:38,505
Me too!

1670
02:20:38,530 --> 02:20:41,248
All right! Prem, get the camera.

1671
02:20:52,267 --> 02:20:53,037
Are you going?

1672
02:20:57,164 --> 02:21:00,707
There's no excuse now...
so that I can stop you.

1673
02:21:06,108 --> 02:21:09,327
Can I ask you something?
Will you tell me the truth?

1674
02:21:10,511 --> 02:21:11,085
What?

1675
02:21:17,315 --> 02:21:18,402
Why did you stop me yesterday?

1676
02:21:21,662 --> 02:21:22,730
I wanted to speak to you
on a couple of topics.

1677
02:21:23,362 --> 02:21:23,832
What?

1678
02:21:25,098 --> 02:21:26,676
Immediately after the
inauguration of the factory...

1679
02:21:27,263 --> 02:21:29,042
...l'll speak to sister-in-law
about our marriage.

1680
02:21:55,369 --> 02:21:57,274
What are you all staring
at, my dear friends?

1681
02:21:57,334 --> 02:22:00,132
Our Prem is the big boss today!
Salute him!

1682
02:22:00,689 --> 02:22:02,048
- Good!
- Thank you!

1683
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:05,876
Are you going to your
maternal place tomorrow?

1684
02:22:05,901 --> 02:22:08,650
Yes, mom and dad remember
the little one a lot.

1685
02:22:08,946 --> 02:22:10,419
- I will go with her.
- I'll go.

1686
02:22:10,459 --> 02:22:11,576
- I'll go...
- I'll go...

1687
02:22:11,604 --> 02:22:11,815
Shut up!

1688
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:12,501
We both will go.

1689
02:22:12,526 --> 02:22:15,892
- There's a letter from your village.
- Letter from my village?

1690
02:22:16,212 --> 02:22:17,845
What does it say? Please, read it.

1691
02:22:18,862 --> 02:22:21,423
- What is written?
- Your sister-in-law is very sick.

1692
02:22:21,841 --> 02:22:23,638
She has been admitted to a hospital.

1693
02:22:23,992 --> 02:22:25,041
They've asked you to
come over immediately.

1694
02:22:25,853 --> 02:22:26,888
But...

1695
02:22:28,602 --> 02:22:29,071
Sister-in-law...

1696
02:22:29,244 --> 02:22:30,517
You make the arrangements to leave.

1697
02:22:30,568 --> 02:22:34,126
You will get the afternoon bus.
I'll make the arrangements for you to leave.

1698
02:22:38,955 --> 02:22:41,666
Who are you giving this cash to?

1699
02:22:41,856 --> 02:22:44,048
I'm giving it to Lalloo.
He'll need it for the treatment.

1700
02:22:44,266 --> 02:22:50,068
This is what I feared.
I know these servants very well.

1701
02:22:50,155 --> 02:22:54,305
- This sickness is an excuse to get some cash.
- Auntie!

1702
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:58,114
Letters like these are
available for 5 bucks.

1703
02:22:58,234 --> 02:23:01,032
Neither will this cash
come back nor will he...

1704
02:23:04,412 --> 02:23:10,903
It was my duty to caution you.
Now it's left to you to decide. Servant!

1705
02:23:27,636 --> 02:23:28,666
Lalloo!

1706
02:23:30,365 --> 02:23:37,565
I swear! This letter is not fake.
It hasn't been bought.

1707
02:23:39,048 --> 02:23:43,015
It's a false accusation.

1708
02:23:43,282 --> 02:23:47,961
It's because I'm a small man!

1709
02:23:51,614 --> 02:23:53,003
From when have you become small?

1710
02:23:57,581 --> 02:24:00,550
You call me sister-in-law, right?

1711
02:24:01,937 --> 02:24:04,457
Keep this.

1712
02:24:04,598 --> 02:24:11,489
I'm afraid.
What if something happens to her?

1713
02:24:12,112 --> 02:24:14,659
Nothing's going to happen to her.
Come with me.

1714
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:37,017
I'm confident that nothing
will happen to her.

1715
02:24:42,142 --> 02:24:43,243
Go!

1716
02:24:49,103 --> 02:24:50,144
Listen!

1717
02:24:51,086 --> 02:24:56,963
When she is cured,
tell her that you've found yourself a girl.

1718
02:25:07,491 --> 02:25:10,752
- So, are you leaving?
- You come along, too.

1719
02:25:12,530 --> 02:25:14,022
I'll come over to bring you back.

1720
02:25:15,358 --> 02:25:17,733
Let's go, sister-in-law!

1721
02:25:18,284 --> 02:25:20,708
Just a minute! Let us have tea, at least!

1722
02:25:20,733 --> 02:25:24,726
- There's no time for tea now.
- Give the child to me.

1723
02:25:24,904 --> 02:25:25,989
Only one chance, okay?

1724
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:29,831
So, you're ready to go?

1725
02:25:30,871 --> 02:25:31,855
Uncle!

1726
02:25:32,621 --> 02:25:38,714
Lalloo went yesterday.
You will go today. I will be restless.

1727
02:25:38,814 --> 02:25:42,323
The work of our factory has started now.

1728
02:25:42,841 --> 02:25:44,823
Please get my brother-in-law
married and get us a companion.

1729
02:25:44,848 --> 02:25:47,948
That's great, sister-in-law!

1730
02:25:47,979 --> 02:25:48,793
A sister-in-law should be like this.

1731
02:25:48,794 --> 02:25:51,284
Did you see that, Rajesh? What times!

1732
02:25:52,066 --> 02:25:56,105
Daughter-in-law, it's your responsibility
now to find a bride for him.

1733
02:25:56,191 --> 02:25:57,238
I love you, sister-in-law!

1734
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,277
What's the matter, brother-in-law?

1735
02:26:03,418 --> 02:26:05,620
I'm going to my maternal place
and you are the one who's excited.

1736
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,886
One word about your marriage and
the weather seems transformed!

1737
02:26:08,911 --> 02:26:10,238
Yes, sister-in-law! I love you!

1738
02:26:10,615 --> 02:26:12,822
Let's talk something serious now.

1739
02:26:13,027 --> 02:26:15,543
Uncle has given me your
responsibility now.

1740
02:26:15,647 --> 02:26:19,042
Tell me, would you like a love
marriage or an arranged marriage?

1741
02:26:19,218 --> 02:26:22,894
Sister-in-law, a love marriage
that you have to arrange.

1742
02:26:23,503 --> 02:26:25,636
- What?
- I love you, sister-in-law!

1743
02:26:28,299 --> 02:26:31,510
Did you see that, son?
Your uncle is smarter than your dad!

1744
02:26:32,019 --> 02:26:33,886
He has already found an auntie for you.

1745
02:26:34,269 --> 02:26:38,198
Even he likes his auntie.
He has seen the photo.

1746
02:26:38,273 --> 02:26:40,183
What do you say, little one? Say, yes.

1747
02:26:42,214 --> 02:26:43,652
Show me the photo, too.

1748
02:26:44,227 --> 02:26:46,597
You talk about photo,
I'll show you her face itself.

1749
02:26:46,972 --> 02:26:48,769
So, is the destination
of your love on the way?

1750
02:26:48,927 --> 02:26:51,808
It's on the way,
sister-in-law, on the way.

1751
02:27:01,826 --> 02:27:04,870
My destination has
arrived but where's yours?

1752
02:27:05,105 --> 02:27:07,519
Sister-in-law, the destination
of both of us is the same.

1753
02:27:10,355 --> 02:27:11,407
Nisha!

1754
02:27:16,761 --> 02:27:18,058
Welcome, sister-in-law!

1755
02:27:18,339 --> 02:27:19,355
Hey!

1756
02:27:19,444 --> 02:27:20,629
Come on in.

1757
02:27:21,332 --> 02:27:23,253
Sister-in-law, have a seat.
Think of it as your own home!

1758
02:27:23,278 --> 02:27:25,433
- What is all this?
- You read this first.

1759
02:27:27,224 --> 02:27:30,252
'Mom and dad have gone out.'
- 'Won't return till evening.'

1760
02:27:30,277 --> 02:27:31,831
'You have your breakfast-Nisha!'

1761
02:27:32,371 --> 02:27:37,503
I got it! You and your madam
have pre-arranged this program.

1762
02:27:38,150 --> 02:27:41,605
What love!
Call up your brother at the office.

1763
02:27:41,630 --> 02:27:44,105
Why? - Let me give him the good news too.

1764
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:46,784
- Sister-in-law, where are your feet?
- Call up!

1765
02:27:49,621 --> 02:27:50,199
Hello!

1766
02:27:50,519 --> 02:27:54,332
- Is brother in?
- No. He's gone out for some important work.

1767
02:27:54,510 --> 02:27:56,222
- Gone out?
- Leave a message.

1768
02:27:56,254 --> 02:27:59,144
Tell him to call up sister-in-law,
as soon as he returns. - Yes.

1769
02:28:01,005 --> 02:28:05,611
Now, please get up.
Put this on Nisha in front of me.

1770
02:28:05,636 --> 02:28:09,248
Sister-in-law, how can I? Your sister
is so shy that she's not coming down.

1771
02:28:09,743 --> 02:28:14,175
If she's not coming down, we'll go to her.

1772
02:28:15,557 --> 02:28:18,409
We're from the boy's side.
We'll take along the marriage procession.

1773
02:28:21,144 --> 02:28:23,389
"I'm going..."

1774
02:28:25,406 --> 02:28:31,937
"I'm going with my brother-in-law's
marriage procession."

1775
02:28:34,204 --> 02:28:40,165
"I'm going with my brother-in-law's
marriage procession."

1776
02:28:40,548 --> 02:28:45,793
"No music, nobody else,
only the message of happiness"

1777
02:28:45,864 --> 02:28:52,239
"I'm going with my brother-in-law's
marriage procession."

1778
02:29:06,763 --> 02:29:11,770
"Brother-in-law becomes the groom
and wears the turban on the head."

1779
02:29:12,667 --> 02:29:17,122
"Sister-in-law gives him her blessings."

1780
02:29:19,979 --> 02:29:24,939
"The buds of love blossom and
we get happiness all the time."

1781
02:29:25,797 --> 02:29:30,403
"I bless you from the bottom of my heart."

1782
02:29:31,647 --> 02:29:36,942
"Astride a horse,
this groom goes to get his bride"

1783
02:29:36,967 --> 02:29:39,223
"I'm going..."

1784
02:29:41,372 --> 02:29:47,450
"I'm going with my brother-in-law's
marriage procession."

1785
02:29:53,418 --> 02:29:58,378
"That's great Lord!
What a pair you have created!"

1786
02:29:59,122 --> 02:30:03,942
"Brother-in-law and sister-in-law...
congratulations!"

1787
02:30:05,153 --> 02:30:08,066
"More than any other
ritual in this world..."

1788
02:30:08,091 --> 02:30:10,762
"...the relation of hearts
is the most important!"

1789
02:30:13,945 --> 02:30:19,012
"The all-important moment has arrived."

1790
02:30:19,763 --> 02:30:24,262
"Till yesterday, I was the only
daughter-in-law of the house."

1791
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:31,989
"I will command and I will stare too."

1792
02:30:32,877 --> 02:30:37,465
"And she'll just watch with awe."

1793
02:30:38,681 --> 02:30:43,864
"I come with a thousand dreams"

1794
02:30:43,889 --> 02:30:46,366
"I'm going..."

1795
02:30:48,468 --> 02:30:54,972
"I'm going with my brother-in-law's
marriage procession"

1796
02:31:12,167 --> 02:31:15,136
It must be his phone.
Nisha, please take care of him.

1797
02:31:37,698 --> 02:31:38,261
Sister-in-law!

1798
02:32:50,995 --> 02:32:54,691
Doctor, she's trying to say something.

1799
02:33:08,497 --> 02:33:09,855
Injection Atropine, quick!

1800
02:33:30,090 --> 02:33:32,582
Please do something, doctor.

1801
02:33:53,894 --> 02:33:54,720
What's the matter, doctor?

1802
02:33:57,689 --> 02:33:58,283
I'm sorry!

1803
02:34:59,483 --> 02:35:04,443
Have it, Tuffy! The one who used
to feed you won't be coming!

1804
02:35:06,005 --> 02:35:11,223
She was here only for a few
days to distribute her love.

1805
02:35:12,723 --> 02:35:13,779
Have it, dear!

1806
02:35:16,755 --> 02:35:19,809
Be brave, brother.

1807
02:35:20,395 --> 02:35:24,667
Wonder what magic she had!
Without her, we've forgotten to live!

1808
02:35:25,700 --> 02:35:27,224
We've forgotten to live, doctor!

1809
02:35:34,817 --> 02:35:36,785
Hey, brother. Stop!

1810
02:35:38,474 --> 02:35:41,661
How are you, brother? Take this cash.

1811
02:35:41,942 --> 02:35:43,903
Brother, a miracle
occurred a few days back.

1812
02:35:44,575 --> 02:35:46,099
Jagan... Jagan!

1813
02:35:46,731 --> 02:35:51,082
All the doctors had given up.
They said that she wouldn't survive.

1814
02:35:51,505 --> 02:35:55,606
But I had faith that
nothing could happen to her.

1815
02:35:56,640 --> 02:35:58,608
After all, my sister-in-law
Pooja had prayed for her!

1816
02:35:58,690 --> 02:36:01,153
And that's what happened.
She opened her eyes and smiled.

1817
02:36:01,429 --> 02:36:06,230
I told her that it's because of
my sister-in-law's blessings.

1818
02:36:07,737 --> 02:36:12,223
I'd like to give this good
news to my sister-in-law.

1819
02:36:21,571 --> 02:36:25,286
That blessing which was over
us has been snatched from us.

1820
02:36:52,610 --> 02:36:55,463
Big brother, what happened?

1821
02:36:56,932 --> 02:36:58,188
What has happened, big brother?

1822
02:36:59,437 --> 02:37:05,398
Sir, she gave up her life
for the sake of my tears!

1823
02:37:06,694 --> 02:37:12,408
She blessed and gave the gift
of life to my own sister-in-law.

1824
02:37:15,954 --> 02:37:21,596
Big brother, do ask God as to why
he takes away all the good people.

1825
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:25,947
Why does he call them?
Ask him, big brother.

1826
02:37:27,010 --> 02:37:29,096
Laloo, your sister-in-law
Pooja was a goddess of love!

1827
02:37:29,851 --> 02:37:31,648
She was so full of love and care!

1828
02:37:33,259 --> 02:37:38,660
He is hungry for love, too!
He needs love, too!

1829
02:37:40,971 --> 02:37:41,495
Uncle!

1830
02:37:42,377 --> 02:37:45,416
The love and care that you talk about...

1831
02:37:46,251 --> 02:37:49,471
...that was rightfully
due to our little one.

1832
02:37:50,846 --> 02:37:52,814
What will happen of him now?

1833
02:37:54,656 --> 02:37:58,036
Big brother, what will
happen of our little one now?

1834
02:37:58,679 --> 02:38:02,479
Big brother, tell me,
what will happen of our little one?

1835
02:38:23,051 --> 02:38:25,151
Go child, go and put him
to sleep in his place.

1836
02:38:25,925 --> 02:38:26,284
Yes!

1837
02:38:36,527 --> 02:38:38,815
- Is the child asleep?
- He's trying to sleep.

1838
02:38:41,245 --> 02:38:44,323
He considers his auntie's
lap to be his mother's.

1839
02:38:52,889 --> 02:38:57,307
After Pooja's departure,
when we miss her so much...

1840
02:38:58,527 --> 02:39:00,331
...just think of Rajesh's plight.

1841
02:39:20,306 --> 02:39:25,266
Rajesh is not very well.
He may not say a word...

1842
02:39:26,219 --> 02:39:28,358
...but we have been observing
him for the past few days.

1843
02:39:29,668 --> 02:39:36,209
He is mentally disturbed thinking
of the welfare of the child.

1844
02:39:36,404 --> 02:39:40,811
- But doctor, what is the cure?
- There is a cure.

1845
02:39:42,876 --> 02:39:46,881
Brother, we have to set
up his life once again.

1846
02:39:50,532 --> 02:39:54,998
Professor... 'This is the way of
life that can't go unnoticed...

1847
02:39:56,624 --> 02:39:59,990
...the breath stops but life goes on!'

1848
02:40:02,271 --> 02:40:06,537
For a child, the shadow of
a mother is very important.

1849
02:40:06,863 --> 02:40:09,576
I'd say, at an appropriate moment,
do speak to Rajesh about it.

1850
02:40:10,031 --> 02:40:13,193
Please drop me to the dispensary.
I'll give Rajesh's medicines too.

1851
02:40:14,306 --> 02:40:15,326
I'll leave, professor.

1852
02:40:19,951 --> 02:40:22,920
The doctor was absolutely right.

1853
02:40:23,443 --> 02:40:29,889
Rajesh, you need not
worry about your child.

1854
02:40:30,135 --> 02:40:32,021
Do heed my advice and remarry.

1855
02:40:33,425 --> 02:40:37,217
You haven't aged!
You will still get a lot of proposals.

1856
02:40:38,047 --> 02:40:41,490
Well, my Sweetie is all ready
for marriage even today.

1857
02:40:42,350 --> 02:40:45,435
If Rajesh had got married to Sweetie...

1858
02:40:45,621 --> 02:40:47,678
...we would have been spared
the agony of this day.

1859
02:40:47,881 --> 02:40:48,529
Bhagvanti!

1860
02:40:48,686 --> 02:40:49,522
You better be quiet!

1861
02:40:50,313 --> 02:40:52,857
Rajesh, my child,
I have already spoken to Sweetie.

1862
02:40:53,137 --> 02:40:56,608
She has only one condition.
The maid will look after the child.

1863
02:40:56,724 --> 02:40:57,170
What?

1864
02:40:57,999 --> 02:41:00,193
- Will a maid look after the child?
- Yes.

1865
02:41:00,829 --> 02:41:08,341
Big brother, I beg of you. Don't hand
over our little one to such a woman...

1866
02:41:08,433 --> 02:41:10,208
...who doesn't know the
meaning of the word 'mother'.

1867
02:41:10,241 --> 02:41:13,107
- You don't interfere!
- Lalloo is right.

1868
02:41:13,951 --> 02:41:16,865
This choice of yours doesn't
have the qualities of a mother.

1869
02:41:17,322 --> 02:41:21,873
To love somebody else's child,
one needs to understand one's customs.

1870
02:41:21,898 --> 02:41:22,615
Do you understand?

1871
02:41:22,654 --> 02:41:23,113
Look!

1872
02:41:23,138 --> 02:41:25,459
Sister-in-law, he is right.

1873
02:41:25,537 --> 02:41:28,568
He's talking a lot of rubbish
and affronting my niece.

1874
02:41:28,610 --> 02:41:31,091
Which girl would like to be a step mom?

1875
02:41:31,123 --> 02:41:33,662
Which parents would hand
over her daughter to Rajesh?

1876
02:41:33,711 --> 02:41:35,412
Forgive me, I'd like to ask you...

1877
02:41:35,437 --> 02:41:37,271
...will you get your
Nisha married to Rajesh?

1878
02:41:38,779 --> 02:41:39,584
Bhagvanti!

1879
02:41:40,365 --> 02:41:41,412
Stop it. That's enough now.

1880
02:41:41,463 --> 02:41:45,935
You be quiet.
Keep the lectures for your college.

1881
02:41:46,326 --> 02:41:50,051
I ask you, what's the harm in the
condition laid down by Sweetie?

1882
02:41:50,076 --> 02:41:52,874
All this argument for
the sake of a mere child.

1883
02:41:52,915 --> 02:41:55,795
How does it matter? Children do grow up.

1884
02:41:55,820 --> 02:41:56,537
Bhagvanti!

1885
02:42:01,045 --> 02:42:01,631
Disgusting!

1886
02:42:05,142 --> 02:42:09,787
This nature of yours might be
responsible for us to be childless.

1887
02:42:17,761 --> 02:42:20,566
I'm sorry... sorry!

1888
02:42:25,925 --> 02:42:26,660
No, uncle!

1889
02:42:27,944 --> 02:42:29,912
I don't want a step mom for my son.

1890
02:42:31,518 --> 02:42:34,487
All the step moms aren't necessarily bad.

1891
02:42:34,751 --> 02:42:38,386
- Brother!
- No, Prem. I won't marry again.

1892
02:42:41,661 --> 02:42:42,386
Come in, professor.

1893
02:42:46,557 --> 02:42:48,525
Rajesh isn't ready to marry.

1894
02:42:50,544 --> 02:42:56,605
He is right too. How can he hand
over his cherished one to a stranger?

1895
02:42:57,708 --> 02:43:05,183
Dad, for my son and me,
Pooja's thoughts would suffice!

1896
02:43:06,631 --> 02:43:09,714
But, someday,
you will have to get married.

1897
02:43:11,870 --> 02:43:14,619
Today, we all are there to
take care of the little one.

1898
02:43:15,082 --> 02:43:19,824
His grandfather, grandmother...
but we won't be there always!

1899
02:43:21,414 --> 02:43:23,798
In life, at every step, one needs support.

1900
02:43:24,996 --> 02:43:29,923
And then, bringing up a child
is a major responsibility.

1901
02:43:31,592 --> 02:43:33,928
But chances are that my
son might get such a mom...

1902
02:43:35,142 --> 02:43:36,772
...who might ignore him in the future.

1903
02:43:38,325 --> 02:43:42,827
For him, the mother that
would come would be his own.

1904
02:43:43,956 --> 02:43:49,748
Kailashnath, what if Nisha comes
into this house in place of Pooja?

1905
02:43:54,044 --> 02:43:56,889
From the time she's gone from here,
she's been talking about this place.

1906
02:43:57,704 --> 02:43:59,678
The child too is in her
care throughout the day.

1907
02:44:01,857 --> 02:44:04,709
Get married to Nisha, Rajesh.
In these conditions...

1908
02:44:04,734 --> 02:44:08,897
...if anyone can take the place of his
mom, it would be his auntie.

1909
02:44:50,729 --> 02:44:52,816
What do you have to say, Prem?

1910
02:44:54,639 --> 02:44:58,746
- Please do agree brother.
- The child will get a mom.

1911
02:45:00,669 --> 02:45:01,866
Please ask Nisha, first.

1912
02:45:05,532 --> 02:45:10,183
I deemed it right and spoke
about Nisha to Kailashnath.

1913
02:45:12,465 --> 02:45:14,308
If Nisha goes into that
house as a daughter-in-law...

1914
02:45:15,175 --> 02:45:17,504
...and brightens up
Pooja's house once again.

1915
02:45:18,770 --> 02:45:20,996
I don't think we can ask for
any happiness greater than that.

1916
02:45:24,588 --> 02:45:31,590
I'll ask Nisha and if she agrees
we'll get her married with fanfare.

1917
02:45:35,044 --> 02:45:40,074
Due to Pooja's absence,
we must not be found lacking in any way.

1918
02:45:44,268 --> 02:45:45,280
You...

1919
02:45:47,473 --> 02:45:48,562
Nisha!

1920
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:52,949
Nisha!

1921
02:45:56,738 --> 02:45:57,832
What is your wish, my child?

1922
02:45:58,962 --> 02:45:59,910
Whatever you'll deem fit.

1923
02:46:04,722 --> 02:46:06,153
I'll just call up Kailashnath.

1924
02:46:07,574 --> 02:46:08,434
PROF. CHOWDHURY: Hello, Kailashnath!

1925
02:46:09,410 --> 02:46:10,527
Nisha has agreed.

1926
02:46:11,001 --> 02:46:14,614
I'll call up the priest today and find
an auspicious date for the marriage.

1927
02:46:15,848 --> 02:46:16,932
That's true.

1928
02:46:18,004 --> 02:46:19,137
Yes, absolutely!

1929
02:46:51,903 --> 02:46:57,528
"O mother, the crow on your
roof foretells that..."

1930
02:46:57,553 --> 02:47:00,345
"...your darling daughter
has renounced this house..."

1931
02:47:00,377 --> 02:47:02,564
"...and has fallen in
love with a stranger!"

1932
02:47:02,629 --> 02:47:05,090
Welcome, Kailashnath. Welcome, son.

1933
02:47:05,848 --> 02:47:06,856
Are you through with the preparations?

1934
02:47:06,881 --> 02:47:08,184
Yes, the cards have already been printed.

1935
02:47:08,606 --> 02:47:10,403
We'd gone to Ramtekdi for blessings.

1936
02:47:10,451 --> 02:47:12,248
Thought that we'd meet the little one too.

1937
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:15,988
- Where is our little one?
- He's upstairs in Nisha's room.

1938
02:47:16,356 --> 02:47:18,254
- Child, please go and get the little one.
- I'll do that.

1939
02:47:18,726 --> 02:47:21,363
How is Nisha? - She's fine.
She's applying henna on her hands.

1940
02:47:25,395 --> 02:47:27,777
Sister, auntie has asked me to
bring the little one downstairs.

1941
02:47:27,858 --> 02:47:30,073
- May I take him?
- Yes. Be careful.

1942
02:47:30,395 --> 02:47:31,239
Don't worry!

1943
02:47:31,606 --> 02:47:37,043
Just have a look at what I have in my hand.
Her wedding card.

1944
02:47:38,028 --> 02:47:39,317
Please, read it.

1945
02:47:40,468 --> 02:47:44,699
'By the grace of God the
marriage of our daughter Nisha...

1946
02:47:44,724 --> 02:47:48,746
...has been fixed with
Rajesh.' 'You are welcome...'

1947
02:47:49,010 --> 02:47:51,075
- What are you reading? Read properly.
- I'm reading properly.

1948
02:47:51,685 --> 02:47:55,953
'By the grace of God the
marriage of our daughter Nisha...

1949
02:47:55,978 --> 02:48:01,629
...has been fixed with Rajesh.
You are welcome to bless the couple.'

1950
02:48:01,741 --> 02:48:03,293
- Give it to me.
- What happened?

1951
02:48:13,528 --> 02:48:18,622
"O mother, the crow on your
roof foretells that..."

1952
02:48:18,816 --> 02:48:21,367
"...your darling daughter
has renounced this house..."

1953
02:48:21,392 --> 02:48:23,719
"...and has fallen in
love with a stranger!"

1954
02:48:29,867 --> 02:48:34,671
"You had taken a religious
vow for my wedding..."

1955
02:48:35,406 --> 02:48:40,578
"...now you should get me
engaged with that sage."

1956
02:48:40,953 --> 02:48:44,609
"Apply henna on these hands."

1957
02:48:46,490 --> 02:48:49,140
"Apply henna on these hands..."

1958
02:48:49,211 --> 02:48:51,992
"...and tie the auspicious
thread of the ritual."

1959
02:48:52,059 --> 02:48:54,894
Uncle... this...

1960
02:48:54,934 --> 02:48:56,426
Nisha!

1961
02:48:57,895 --> 02:48:58,457
Nisha!

1962
02:48:58,748 --> 02:49:02,402
You've done us a big favour by
agreeing to get married to Rajesh.

1963
02:49:05,183 --> 02:49:07,809
You have given a new lease
of life to two people.

1964
02:49:08,762 --> 02:49:09,621
You've given them a new life.

1965
02:49:10,438 --> 02:49:11,004
See!

1966
02:49:31,582 --> 02:49:32,340
Nisha!

1967
02:49:32,613 --> 02:49:35,823
- What happened?
- She was all right, just now.

1968
02:49:35,848 --> 02:49:36,942
Please, call some doctor.

1969
02:49:37,325 --> 02:49:38,739
- Nisha!
- Child...

1970
02:49:40,521 --> 02:49:44,480
She's perfectly all right.
I've given her an injection.

1971
02:49:44,763 --> 02:49:45,824
She'll be conscious very soon.

1972
02:49:45,849 --> 02:49:49,488
- Doctor, how come, all of a sudden...
- It's a matter of marriage...

1973
02:49:49,565 --> 02:49:51,362
...must have felt giddy
due to the exertion.

1974
02:49:51,557 --> 02:49:54,504
Don't be afraid, professor.
I'll take your leave.

1975
02:49:54,590 --> 02:49:55,332
- Bhola...
- Yes...

1976
02:49:55,496 --> 02:49:57,863
Thank God. We'll take your leave too.

1977
02:49:58,417 --> 02:50:01,011
- Okay, little one!
- Come here...

1978
02:50:02,809 --> 02:50:04,129
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

1979
02:50:05,184 --> 02:50:08,067
Mom, I'd like to meet Nisha for once.

1980
02:50:08,092 --> 02:50:10,551
- Come.
- Not now. I don't want to disturb her.

1981
02:50:11,057 --> 02:50:12,916
- Please, give her this letter.
- Okay!

1982
02:50:39,361 --> 02:50:42,572
RAJESH: Nisha, the step that you've
taken for the sake of the little one...

1983
02:50:43,033 --> 02:50:44,713
...l'm grateful to you for that.

1984
02:50:45,673 --> 02:50:47,439
Everyone is very happy with this decision.

1985
02:50:48,387 --> 02:50:53,400
But I know that every girl has
her own dreams, her own ambitions.

1986
02:50:54,581 --> 02:50:59,673
Nisha, if there is something in your
heart, please let me know.

1987
02:51:00,407 --> 02:51:04,400
Nothing is greater than
your happiness. Rajesh.

1988
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:36,306
Hello!

1989
02:51:40,032 --> 02:51:40,513
Who?

1990
02:51:52,982 --> 02:51:58,918
"I will erase the memories
of love from my heart."

1991
02:51:59,270 --> 02:52:05,207
"For the sake of my responsibilities,
I will forget everything."

1992
02:52:11,895 --> 02:52:17,731
"The responsibilities that
you have to live up to!"

1993
02:52:18,192 --> 02:52:23,887
"How will I repay you for this favour?"

1994
02:52:24,434 --> 02:52:30,473
"As a mark of respect,
I bow in front of you."

1995
02:52:30,801 --> 02:52:37,058
"As a mark of respect,
I bow in front of you"

1996
02:53:39,414 --> 02:53:41,172
Auntie, let me hold my nephew.

1997
02:53:41,606 --> 02:53:43,452
Come to your uncle, my dear.

1998
02:53:43,625 --> 02:53:44,203
Go!

1999
02:53:47,859 --> 02:53:48,594
Come, child.

2000
02:54:03,622 --> 02:54:09,934
Oh God, what troubled times are we facing?

2001
02:54:15,525 --> 02:54:17,700
Prem brother has taken an
oath from me not to speak out.

2002
02:54:18,521 --> 02:54:19,627
He's made me helpless.

2003
02:54:20,848 --> 02:54:28,945
But you aren't helpless.
Oh God, work out such a miracle today...

2004
02:54:28,970 --> 02:54:35,825
...so that your devotees
trust you all the more.

2005
02:54:36,115 --> 02:54:36,779
O God!

2006
02:56:41,058 --> 02:56:46,559
'Prem, my sister strengthened
our love with this necklace.'

2007
02:56:47,707 --> 02:56:49,715
'She wished that her brother-in-law's
wife should wear this necklace.'

2008
02:56:50,694 --> 02:56:52,902
'I'm returning it. Nisha.'

2009
02:57:10,321 --> 02:57:15,790
Tuffy, please do me a favour.
Please give this to Prem.

2010
02:57:38,947 --> 02:57:40,315
Please come, Rajesh.

2011
02:58:28,312 --> 02:58:29,355
Tuffy!

2012
02:58:41,387 --> 02:58:46,465
NISHA: Prem, my sister strengthened
our love with this necklace.

2013
02:58:47,314 --> 02:58:49,379
She wished that her brother-in-law's
wife should wear this necklace.

2014
02:58:50,684 --> 02:58:52,926
I'm returning it. Nisha.

2015
02:59:13,904 --> 02:59:14,544
RAJESH: Nisha!

2016
02:59:44,995 --> 02:59:45,847
What is this, Nisha?

2017
03:00:03,851 --> 03:00:07,810
Did you see Pooja,
what the two of them were about to do?

2018
03:00:12,164 --> 03:00:15,891
What would I've done?
If they had taken this step.

2019
03:00:18,741 --> 03:00:22,700
What's the matter, Rajesh?
Why did you come up all of a sudden?

2020
03:00:22,988 --> 03:00:27,948
Please read this and tell
me if this is justice.

2021
03:00:58,038 --> 03:01:00,730
Uncle, this cherished one of yours...

2022
03:01:02,009 --> 03:01:04,293
...one who used to come to me
for the smallest of advice!

2023
03:01:05,896 --> 03:01:07,949
Today, hiding such a momentous
thing in his heart...

2024
03:01:10,158 --> 03:01:11,371
...keeping it behind the
facade of his smile...

2025
03:01:13,624 --> 03:01:15,293
...he has made me a stranger!

2026
03:01:18,159 --> 03:01:20,871
Prem, what you did isn't right.

2027
03:01:25,144 --> 03:01:26,158
Mom!

2028
03:01:26,925 --> 03:01:30,129
After Pooja's departure,
I had only one wish.

2029
03:01:31,790 --> 03:01:33,808
That my child never misses his mother.

2030
03:01:36,318 --> 03:01:40,949
I ask of you Nisha,
if you had accepted him as an auntie...

2031
03:01:41,699 --> 03:01:43,442
...would your motherly
love have been reduced?

2032
03:01:44,584 --> 03:01:46,933
Tell me, Nisha. Tell me.

2033
03:01:47,564 --> 03:01:50,261
Why are you quiet, Nisha? Answer me!

2034
03:01:59,146 --> 03:02:02,988
You fool! Were you out to sacrifice
your entire life and happiness?

2035
03:02:08,167 --> 03:02:11,918
Rajesh, you should be proud of them.

2036
03:02:13,137 --> 03:02:16,824
Whatever they did, they did it
considering it to be their duty.

2037
03:02:17,790 --> 03:02:19,758
I too have a duty now.

2038
03:02:21,683 --> 03:02:22,878
Pooja's incomplete dream!

2039
03:02:24,554 --> 03:02:26,522
Actually, it was my fault.

2040
03:02:27,831 --> 03:02:35,394
I couldn't understand what you were
trying to tell me... while departing.

2041
03:02:38,091 --> 03:02:42,262
Dad, I have a request.

2042
03:02:43,784 --> 03:02:46,262
Please get Nisha married to Prem.

2043
03:02:49,433 --> 03:02:50,324
Kailashnath!

2044
03:02:52,075 --> 03:02:54,191
I might have done some good
deeds in my last birth!

2045
03:02:58,080 --> 03:03:02,472
I'm blessed by getting such sons-in-law!

2046
03:03:16,548 --> 03:03:18,844
"We all admire you today!"

2047
03:03:57,633 --> 03:04:01,564
"I'm so full of happiness!"

2048
03:04:01,682 --> 03:04:06,885
"What else can my heart ask for?"

2049
03:04:06,916 --> 03:04:11,617
"I've got everything that
I could ever ask for!"
