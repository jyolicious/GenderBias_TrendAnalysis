00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:56,479
Courier

2
00:00:57,324 --> 00:01:02,193
Cuddapah - Andhra.

3
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,252
Escape.

4
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,483
No...

5
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,586
They tried to escape.

6
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,088
Singamuthu, you are an elder.

7
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,388
Don't you have any concious.

8
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,227
Look at their state.

9
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:51,064
This place is surrounded
by a 2 km. electric fence.

10
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,166
My boys with guns.

11
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,568
I've recruited them like any army.

12
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,566
All this for what?

13
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,410
So that, none of you escape.

14
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,140
But they escaped from the bus in midway.

15
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,481
We won't let them go.

16
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,653
So, I'm grooming a hunting dog,
Cuddappah Raja.

17
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,590
He caught them by their throat.

18
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,652
How dare you hit him?

19
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,562
Brother...

20
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,500
How many more should I kill?

21
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,075
If everyone goes to the hospital,
who will work here?

22
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,407
If you commit 1 wrong,
I will cut your legs.

23
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:38,244
2 wrongs, I will cut your hands.

24
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,412
If you try to escape,
I will cut your head.

25
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,656
- Get up, brother.
- What happened to my brother?

26
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,155
Where will you escape?

27
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:52,987
Will you go to the police?

28
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,326
Will you go to the collector?

29
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,164
No matter where you go,
I can't be touched.

30
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,397
Because I am Konda Reddy.

31
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,667
I'm not just an MLA,

32
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:05,008
this village is mine.

33
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,742
You bastards!

34
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:14,749
Even God can't save you from me.
Hang him.

35
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,318
What happened to my brother?

36
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,661
I don't know whether God
will come to save us,

37
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,491
but my son will come.

38
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,326
When he comes to know
about we suffering here,

39
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,330
your countdown starts.

40
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,497
If this stone has some power,

41
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,338
my words too have a power.

42
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,478
He will come. I swear...

43
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,147
Not only your son,

44
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,151
anyone who dares to come here,
this will be his fate.

45
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:52,982
Get inside.
