Take whatever you can

00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,932
We will flee from here

9
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,510
All of you escape from here

10
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,514
I will manage them
All of you retreat

11
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:18,567

Hey, What are you
searching early morning?

45
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,884
My sheep herds are missing

46
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,387
Some rustler has driven it away

47
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,898
Don't make noise
wait for sometime

48
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,903
Hey, little girl
is the car coming?

49
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,410
What are you searching?

50
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,911
My sheep herds
are missing old lady

51
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,414
She never bothered
about her lost hubby

52
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,918
Is she going to
retrieve your missing herds?

53
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,921
Are you watching
fun here, go and search

54
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,914
Mad guy, come here
Why do you ask them?

55
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,429
Your sheep is being
cooked in Ambi lyer's house

56
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:11,930
Go and see there

57
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,938
Samikannu's Sheep, be quiet

58
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,450
Roja, car is coming

59
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,946
Hey, run
little girl, come down

60
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,960
Don't stand like a tree, Go

61
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,493
Is he the groom...?

62
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,506
- Gosh, cigarette
- Yes

63
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,023
If you like it so much
I can leave you behind

64
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,032
Duck now

65
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,041
He turns, run

66
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,053
Samikannu Brother
your sheep's are straying

67
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,055
and you are watching the fun

68
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,557
Shouldn't you be responsible?

69
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,559
The herd has blocked car of
my sister's prospective groom

70
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,561
Go and drive them away

71
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,065
Brother careful
they will abuse you in English

72
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,567
If you don't know, ask me

73
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,570
Boys go and see it
Useless fellows

74
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,576
Sister's groom has come, Come on

75
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,079
Looks like a star
Talks English

76
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,583
Are you going
for bathing, Come soon

77
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,585
- Come, we have seen
- Vehicle has come

78
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,588
Come, the groom has come

79
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,593
- Chenbagam sister
- Where were you?

80
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,594
I asked you to
decorate and pluck flowers

81
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,596
- But you are roaming
- Mom where is sister?

82
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,598
What will happen
if your dad knows...

83
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,591
Sister, seen
I have seen

84
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,604
- What?
- Not for you, close your ears

85
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,099
He is fair,
handsome and very tall

86
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,113
He talks English grandma
Seems to be well educated

87
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,616
He smokes, but
seems to be a nice guy

88
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,619
I like him very much
Right match for my sister

89
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,122
Why are you eulogizing him?

90
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,124
Is the marriage
for you or your sister?

91
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,127
Keep quiet grandma
I want to study further

92
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,130
I don't want to marry
This is my sister's marriage

93
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,633
I vowed to pour 50
pot full to Goddess Muthalamman

94
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,137
Sister, stay as you are
Don't move

95
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,647
Pray now, Shall I pray for you?

96
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,151
He must be
the nicest guy in the world

97
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,654
He should like you
the moment he sees you

98
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,157
Within 4 days your
marriage should be celebrated

99
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,661
You must travel
in car, with him to the city

100
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,655
Before you go
I should hug you and weep

101
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,181
We have come to see just one girl

102
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,688
Will one of them select me?

103
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,190
You only said you
don't want a Madras girl

104
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,692
and want a village girl

105
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,195
What is this
they murmur in English?

106
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,197
Because they are from the city

107
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,702
- What is the groom doing
- Cryptologist

108
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,704
What cryptology?
Couldn't understand

109
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,707
- Don't you know?
It means photography, -My God!

110
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,702
- What is your salary?
- Not bad

111
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:59,707
Does it mean
1000, 2000 or 5000? Tell us

112
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,211
- Periyasamy, groom is evasive
- Yes

113
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:08,226
- Hey old lady
- Stop it

114
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,719
Is the groom fit as a fiddle?
Is there any deformity?

115
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:18,226
You have come to village
leaving aside city girls, so...

116
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,738
Ponnatha, shut your mouth

117
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,740
It is our fortune
They want a bride from our village

118
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,243
- Don't mistake us
- Yes brother

119
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,746
What is wrong in asking?
We are giving our girl

120
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,248
Should we not know whether
he is a man or a monkey

121
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,750
You can tell me

122
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,253
- You can count
and check my fingers, -Not that

123
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,255
Shall I carry you till that house?

124
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,759
- No, no
It is OK, - Come on

125
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:44,262
- Not required
- Come on

126
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,772
Be brave

127
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,275
If he asks in English
Respond in English

128
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,279
Don't worry, I have prayed
to all Gods in the village

129
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:05,283
- You stay here
- Why mom?

130
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,290
Prostrate to them

131
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,296
Sit down

132
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,805
With so many of us around
she may not look up

133
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:40,818
He will also not feel free

134
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,312
Let them be alone
Let them talk and decide

135
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,825
How can it be, Madam?

136
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,827
Before marriage
how can we allow them

137
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,829
- to talk in seclusion
- Don't crack jokes

138
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,832
Because you are from city
we brought the girl

139
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,835
Else the boy can see the girl
only after the engagement

140
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,339
In villages this may not
find acceptance

141
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,341
She was only kidding

142
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,346
Wait, there is nothing
wrong in what they ask?

143
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:11,349
After marriage
they are going to live together

144
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,342
Nothing wrong in
them talking to each other

145
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,355
Gosh, Rosa did you hear this?

146
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,357
They are going to
talk in seclusion

147
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,366
For 5 years, many times
I have lighted camphor here

148
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,870
Somehow make
him agree to marry sister

149
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:38,365
I will feed 10 people
I will light a lamp also

150
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,878
Somehow make him give his consent

151
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,895
Talk bravely

152
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,896
Are you going to
excel me and my hubby's

153
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:00,398
talk in the
plantain grove, those days

154
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,901
Where did you
allow that man to talk?

155
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,403
You imprisoned him
just like that, in a basket

156
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,406
Next day morning
only you released him

157
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,908
Don't we know about that?

158
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,909
Looks like a Granny's conference

159
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,905
I was born, bred
and brought up at Madras

160
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,920
I had never been to villages

161
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:28,415
But I want to marry
a village girl, this is my wish

162
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:34,922
I like this place,
the paddy fields, the falls,

163
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,935
the soil, this fragrance...

164
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,440
...these old ladies
I like everything

165
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,433
What are they talking?
Are they Reciting Ramayan?

166
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,948
Are they going to do
what you haven't done when young

167
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,452
Ah, Nalayani, she drove
her husband with in 2 years

168
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,958
Talk something
I will hear your voice

169
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:05,953
Tell something, say Sridevi
or Kollangudi Karupayi

170
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,466
I don't like this marriage

171
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:25,984
Don't shout

172
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,489
Tell them
you don't want this marriage

173
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,993
Tell my dad
that you don't like me

174
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,489
Chenbagam, don't
lean on wall like this

175
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,503
Give that coffee to him

176
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,007
Poor girl
She feels shy

177
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,514
My uncle
Soundarapandi is there for me

178
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,017
Long ago I have
decided him as my husband

179
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,019
There is a family feud
between mine & his dad

180
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,522
So they are looking
for a groom outside kinship

181
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:10,518
if I don't marry him
I will not be alive

182
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,531
Please don't agree
to this marriage

183
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,534
Wait

184
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:26,533
Then why did you
send your photograph to me?

185
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,046
Why did you make us
travel 500 miles?

186
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,048
You could have
told your dad earlier

187
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:36,543
Like my hubby, the city guy
doesn't want to stop talking

188
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,558
OK call your dad
I will tell him

189
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,560
If he comes to know
about this he will kill me

190
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,062
What can I do for that?

191
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,066
If you look at his face
and talk, this will happen

192
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,568
Wipe it

193
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,070
You should somehow save me

194
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,586
- Do you like the girl?
- Speak out without any shyness

195
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,589
Who will dislike our Chenbagam?

196
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,591
His face tells it all

197
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,595
Rishi do you like her?
Can we exchange the trays?

198
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,598
Say 'like her'
Say 'I like her'

199
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:29,597
Say 'like her'

200
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,615
I like this girl

201
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,147
Is it fair?

202
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,151
You have come from city
and are well educated

203
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:14,652
You came to see the eldest girl

204
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,155
Now you say
you like her sister? Is it fair?

205
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,149
Damn with your education
If any local guy said this

206
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,661
He would be flogged

207
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,654
Have you thought about her?
Who will marry her?

208
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,167
What will happen to the family?

209
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,168
All these old
ladies are telling you

210
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:35,161
Don't fall a prey to our curse
I can tell you this much

211
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,185
I told you not to
allow her to walk across

212
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,686
Did you bother to listen?

213
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,688
She has become
an adversary to her sister

214
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,192
- What did I do dad?
- Why are you hasty, you donkey?

215
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,693
You have ruined it

216
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,695
She hasn't done
anything wrong, young girl

217
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,199
- What did she do?
- She was gyrating before him

218
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,700
He was charmed under her spell

219
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,203
Now he is obstinate
that he will marry only her

220
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,204
Don't blame me dad

221
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,207
Do you know
how I prayed for her marriage?

222
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,711
Marriage is a
1000 year crop, it is all destined

223
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,214
If he likes Rosa
Let him marry her

224
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:19,717
Grandma, I will not marry

225
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,220
Be quiet
It is all because of you

226
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,723
This no misfortune
You can't find a groom like this

227
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:31,218
It is your good fortune
They came on their own

228
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:35,722
Rosa is also
old enough for marriage

229
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,235
What are you talking mother?

230
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,736
When the eldest
is yet to be married

231
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,738
How can you
think of her marriage?

232
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,741
There is a groom
waiting for her

233
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,743
Ask your brother in law
Chengiah to come

234
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,246
and finalise her
marriage with Soundarapandian

235
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,749
Do you want me
to forget the 30 year old enmity

236
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,751
Am I so thick skinned?

237
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,754
What great enmity?
Your dad started it all

238
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,256
You fanned it to great heights

239
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,257
Do you want the
posterity to continue it?

240
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,262
Don't do it, they are girls

241
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:05,763
They have to lead a life

242
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,266
They are going to
beget you grandchildren

243
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,268
Don't avenge them

244
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,772
Your mom is telling this

245
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,277
Go, Conduct both
the marriages jointly

246
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,327
Beat the drums

247
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:29,837
<i>Rukkumani,
what is the sound in vicinity?</i>

248
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:36,843
<i>My ears can't bear tenor
find out what makes the sound</i>

249
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:28,395
<i>Rukkumani,
what is the sound in vicinity?</i>

250
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:39,906
<i>My ears can't bear tenor
find out what makes the sound</i>

251
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:46,423
<i>It is the sound of
kisses by married couples</i>

252
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,430
<i>The sound of joy
from the intermittent cot crackles</i>

253
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,935
<i>This sound won't
stop until the rooster cries</i>

254
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:14,441
<i>Rukkumani,
what is the sound in vicinity?</i>

255
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,980
<i>My ears can't bear tenor
find out what makes the sound</i>

256
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,484
<i>The little girl
has a lot of desires</i>

257
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,989
<i>Like an ant trapped in sugar</i>

258
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,995
<i>Step by step
Move up to the cot</i>

259
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,500
<i>The pearl beaded anklets
whine at sound of kissing</i>

260
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,005
<i>The Jasmine flower blossoms</i>

261
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,175
<i>Why does the scalp sweat?</i>

262
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:17,004
<i>Desire spreads the mat
But fear latched it</i>

263
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:34,521
<i>Rukkumani,
what is the sound in vicinity?</i>

264
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:40,026
<i>My ears can't bear tenor
find out what makes the sound</i>

265
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,089
<i>When Spouse
catches the index finger</i>

266
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,594
<i>The point where
the finger touch tickles</i>

267
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,601
<i>Was a concert at the Cupids palace</i>

268
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,106
<i>The bangles of the fille,
composed music</i>

269
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,111
<i>Kisses are exchanged</i>

270
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,613
<i>Life is in a crisis</i>

271
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,616
<i>Mind heats up</i>

272
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,620
<i>This birth gets gratified</i>

273
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:20,126
<i>Rukkumani,
what is the sound in vicinity?</i>

274
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:26,133
<i>My ears can't bear tenor
find out what makes the sound</i>

275
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,146
<i>It is the sound of
kisses by married couples</i>

276
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:35,152
<i>The sound of joy
from the intermittent cot crackles</i>

277
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,658
<i>This sound won't
stop until the rooster cries</i>

278
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,202
We are obliged to you forever

279
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,705
We can never forget your help

280
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,697
- Why?
- Where is Roja?

281
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,210
She was there, inside

282
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,212
- She is not there inside
- Isn't she?

283
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,253
Happy journey

284
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,258
Bye, dad

285
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,262
Grandma

286
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,271
Take care

287
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:36,774
Sister

288
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:49,275
Small desire
fluttering desire

289
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,781
Pearl like desire
stored up desire

290
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:01,287
Desire to kiss the moon

291
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:06,293
Desire planet earth
to orbit around me

292
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:11,798
Small desire
fluttering desire

293
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:17,303
Pearl like desire
stored up desire

294
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,848
Don't know whether
you like our cooking or not

295
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:54,851
- Can I use this much of salt?
- Yes

296
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,353
Little less

297
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,859
Heard you are good
in cooking, your Grandma told me

298
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,862
You can prepare a feast
for fifty people in half an hour

299
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:08,365
But this Rishi isn't
interested in food at all

300
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,368
Always reading, music...

301
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,870
Or his computer

302
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,372
Half of the time
is spent at the library

303
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,375
Will read Newspaper in the
bathroom for half an hour

304
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,377
Crossword too is done there
Just go and look there

305
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,879
You'll find 8 to 10 books

306
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,880
He has never
appreciated my cooking

307
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,884
Try if you can make
him appreciate your cooking

308
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,887
First you ask him to quit smoking

309
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,896
- What is it?
- Smoke

310
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,472
Look

311
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:58,475
It was unintentional

312
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:12,990
Still angry with me?

313
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,994
I said sorry, Forget it

314
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,001
I am not bad

315
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:27,504
Little decent too

316
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,009
Don't I look innocent?

317
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,537
We are going to meet
my chief Dr. Chandramurthy

318
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,540
We are doing computer
software for Indian Military

319
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,043
Coding and Decoding
many confidential matters

320
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,048
Security clearance is
required for those who work

321
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,049
and for their family members also

322
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,051
I am taking you to my Chief

323
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:17,554
Do you understand me?

324
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,560
Wait

325
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,568
Next Saturday?
Is the work going well?

326
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,571
No problem
I will be there in Kashmir

327
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:39,566
2 to 3 days is enough
for any Crypto code

328
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:46,583
Sir, she is my wife

329
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,085
Who?

330
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,095
- Why did you stay here?
- You told me to wait here

331
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,598
OK Come in

332
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,106
I am Rishi's chief
But only in the office

333
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,107
My name is Chandramurthy

334
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,110
Finally got a
gullible girl for Rishi

335
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,117
Did you marry him out of interest?

336
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,622
What is your name?

337
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,627
You keep quiet
do not interfere in this

338
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,131
- What is your native?
- A rural village

339
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,635
Not so, It is Sundarapandiapuram

340
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,138
Tirunelveli district
Girl from our place

341
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:43,139
That's why it is so charming

342
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,642
It's long time
since I heard chaste Tamil

343
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,645
His Tamil, is not good at all

344
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,147
Madras dialect

345
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,139
Isn't the Muthalamman
Temple situated in your place

346
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:58,644
No, it is about
40 miles east of our place

347
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,657
We used to go
there for the flower festival

348
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,160
- Is it in the month of Chithirai?
- No, in the month of Thai

349
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:07,152
For this we take basket
full of flowers in the cart

350
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,665
I have never seen

351
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,667
Sir I have brought her
for the security clearance

352
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,170
I am your chief
Are you threatening me?

353
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,172
Did he threaten you?

354
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,666
- Does Mother and son
speak English at home -Yes

355
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,179
What else did he say?

356
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,684
You do not know
how to talk with the superior

357
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,186
So keep quiet

358
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,188
If you open your mouth
your ignosense will be revealed

359
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,195
He is a book worm
Don't be afraid, I'll take care

360
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,197
Look, this girl is from our place

361
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:45,190
She will not be
shy or timid, bear in mind

362
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:49,206
Roja, do you know
how to prepare 'Paniyaram'?

363
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,207
We have come
for security clearance

364
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:56,202
No clearance is required
for a girl from our place

365
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,205
Do you know this
milky white Paniyaram?

366
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,218
Do you know how to prepare?

367
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:03,720
I can prepare it very well

368
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,223
I will be back
from Kashmir by next week

369
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,725
I will come directly to your house

370
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,718
You must serve me that
hot and steamy Paniyaram

371
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:19,224
What? She is not
assuring and inviting me

372
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,240
I won't be here next week

373
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:26,743
I am going back to my place

374
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,257
It is just 4 days
since your arrival, what happened?

375
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,260
I want to see mom

376
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,764
You have been
with mom for the past 18 years

377
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,267
- Isn't that enough?
- I will go to my place

378
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,270
My dear villager,
hereafter this is your place

379
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,272
This is your house
and I am your husband

380
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,275
No, this is not my house

381
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,779
I do not like this place
doesn't draw me

382
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:04,781
I must not be here

383
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,283
My sister is
supposed to be in this house

384
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,787
You have deceived my sister

385
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,293
Is that the cause for your anger?

386
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,294
Is that why, you were
silent for all these days

387
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,299
Don't you have conscience?
Tell me frankly

388
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:23,800
Can you justify what you've done

389
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,802
- You can't find a girl
like my sister, -Let me speak

390
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,304
Even if you scout for
7 births all over the place

391
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,806
- You have rejected such a person
- I didn't say so

392
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,308
You talked to my sister and suddenly

393
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:32,809
and said you want to marry me

394
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,311
How badly
she would have been hurt?

395
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,312
How can I face my sister now?

396
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,816
- For rest of the life, I can't face her
- Listen to me

397
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:44,310
All of them damned me
that I have enticed you

398
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,822
Will you let me speak?

399
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,824
What is the use of
education, if there is no heart?

400
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,326
- It may be a game in city
- Will you listen?

401
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,327
- You rejected her
- You are not listening to me

402
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,330
- Is it a mock marriage?
- Listen to me

403
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,332
Won't you listen to me?

404
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:08,345
I did not reject her
but she rejected me

405
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,356
I don't like this marriage

406
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:25,862
Don't shout

407
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,368
Tell them
you don't want this marriage

408
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,877
No, you are lying

409
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,379
She can never
talk like that

410
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,874
Chenbagam, don't
lean on wall like this

411
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,888
Give that coffee to him

412
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,881
Poor girl
she feels shy

413
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,399
My uncle
Soundarapandi is there for me

414
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:05,401
Long ago I have
decided him as my husband

415
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,405
There is a family feud
between mine & his dad

416
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:10,907
So they are looking
for a groom outside kinship

417
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:16,402
If I don't marry him
I will not be alive

418
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,415
Please don't agree
to this marriage

419
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,422
How can I believe this?

420
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:33,419
This is the fact
Believe it or leave it

421
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,501
I spoke to sister over phone

422
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,005
She is very happy

423
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,009
Said you are like God to her

424
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,515
I was angry
with you out of ignorance

425
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,019
Forgive me

426
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,023
I swear, I am sorry

427
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:18,535
I am not bad

428
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,537
Little decent too

429
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,041
Don't I look innocent?

430
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:45,061
When?

431
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,564
Which hospital?

432
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,067
What happened?

433
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,070
Prof. Chandramurthy, is admitted
in Trinity Hospital

434
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:55,572
I will see him and come

435
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:08,084
What happened?

436
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,094
Don't be alarmed
with these gadgets?

437
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:22,587
This is a hi-tech plot
by the doctors to make money

438
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,105
- You should do me a favour
- Tell me

439
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,607
I was supposed to go to Kashmir

440
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,109
for an important assignment

441
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,613
I could not go
You may be required to go

442
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,605
- For what? - There is
a military out-post in Baramulla

443
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:44,120
Messages from foreign nations
are intercepted there

444
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,624
which are encoded in Crypto
You should decode it

445
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,126
It is a 2-day assignment

446
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,129
Sunil Tandon
will arrange everything

447
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,132
It is an urgent assignment

448
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,636
In a situation like this in Kashmir

449
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,639
I am worried
about sending you there

450
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,641
Never mind, Kashmir is in India

451
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,643
Why should we fear
to go to any corner in India

452
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:13,149
The military security
will make all arrangements

453
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:16,653
I will take care

454
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:26,652
Remember, white Milk Paniyaram!

455
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,665
Recover quickly and get discharged

456
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,167
I will prepare it for you

457
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,670
Rishi, you are the witness

458
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,683
I telegraphed to your father
he will pick you up

459
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,685
You can go back to
your village as you wish

460
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,688
You come back
whenever you feel like

461
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,193
- Do you understand?
- What work do I have there?

462
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,697
Don't leave me

463
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,701
Take me with you

464
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,203
To Kashmir?

465
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,707
Didn't I apologise?

466
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,711
No need,
you go back to your village

467
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,725
- Aunty, come, - Where
- Come quickly, - What?

468
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:35,231
- What is it?
- Come and have a look

469
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,236
Aunty, ask him not to leave me?

470
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,238
Ask him to take me with him?

471
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,241
Only one week ago you got married

472
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,743
How can you leave her and go?

473
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,745
- Why are you teaming up with her?
- Poor girl

474
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,249
She is young and
newly married, take her with you

475
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,754
My baggage is also ready

476
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,871
Why the streets are isolated?

477
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,377
Roaming on the streets prohibited

478
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:07,873
- Why? - To control
the movement of terrorists

479
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,887
I am little scared

480
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,497
Where are you taking me?

481
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:49,033
<i>The fresh silver
rain falls over here</i>

482
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,037
<i>This dazzling
moon light drenches my body</i>

483
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:56,552
<i>It is chill in the places
which cannot be revealed</i>

484
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,545

<i>If you become the river</i>

490
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,068
<i>I will be the bank</i>

491
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:28,573
<i>If you become the little bird</i>

492
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,579
<i>I will be your sky</i>

493
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:38,082
<i>The fresh silver
rain falls over here</i>

494
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,086

495
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,140
<i>Men do not ask for flowers</i>

496
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,644
<i>where there are no women</i>

497
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,149
<i>Plants do not bloom</i>

498
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:36,652
<i>where there are no women</i>

499
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:41,145
<i>The earth blooms</i>

500
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,660
<i>when the free end
of your saree unfolds</i>

501
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:49,153
<i>This idea was not sung by Kamban</i>

00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,267

00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:56,661

God of the North
I don't know Your name

530
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:04,419
My Grandma has told me
that all Gods are same

531
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:05,921
That is why I have come to You

532
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,424
Do you understand Tamil?

533
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,428
You are God
You know everything

534
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,935
Before I left my village
I fought with my God

535
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:21,937
Telling you have
given me a hubby like him

536
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,939
I won't worship you anymore

537
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:25,941
and won't even visit you

538
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:31,435
Now I realize that
He has given me a nice hubby

539
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:34,450
I spoke in ignorance

540
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:38,954
North God, You should go
and persuade my God

541
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,958
I will break the coconut here
Won't You inform Him?

542
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:46,962
Will You forget?

543
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,477
It is a false alarm
Let's go back

544
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,998
My Goodness!! What is this?

545
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,501
- Is it wrong to break
a coconut here? - Yes

546
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,007

Are you a Tamil?

553
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:00,035

Earlier lot of tourists

Now only terrorists come here

561
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,577
Are you a tourist
or a terrorist?

562
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,579
No, it is an official visit for my hubby

The case is not with us now

698
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:52,868
The army has taken charge

699
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,370
We can do nothing

700
01:17:57,907 --> 01:17:59,374
I don't know about all these

701
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:01,376
You have so many policemen here

- OK Sir, I will tell her
- Do not nod your head

706
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:16,892
They have given 3 days deadline
What is he going to do?

707
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:21,386
He is helpless
because the case is now with Army

708
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,899
Only Colonel Rayappa can do

709
01:18:24,434 --> 01:18:25,401
Let him come over here

710
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:27,903
Tell them
I won't leave until he comes

711
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:36,400
- What is this?
- No matter how long I wait

712
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:38,413
Unless I know
I won't leave this place

713
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:47,423
Come

714
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,427
Poor man's food

715
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,932
Don't know if you would like it

716
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:06,942
How do you know Tamil?

717
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:08,444
What is he saying?

718
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:11,947
I have studied in your state

719
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:13,949
At Coimbatore

720
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:16,451
In Agricultural college

721
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:19,955
For four years

722
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:22,958
Eat slowly, don't be afraid

723
01:19:23,493 --> 01:19:24,960
Once the Govt. Releases Wasim Khan

724
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:26,462
We will free you too

725
01:19:27,497 --> 01:19:28,464
Explain it to him

726
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:29,965
Have food

727
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,467
Don't be afraid

728
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:35,470
Once your Govt. Releases Wasim Khan

729
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:37,472
We will free you too

730
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:39,975
That's what he said

731
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,477
Understood, have your food brother

732
01:19:43,513 --> 01:19:44,480
Who is this Wasim Khan?

733
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,483
How many murders he has done?

734
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:52,988
I am not ready

735
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:55,991
I don't want to be released
in exchange of a murderer

736
01:19:56,526 --> 01:19:57,493
What?

737
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,997
We don't want your consent, eat

738
01:20:03,032 --> 01:20:04,499
Even if it costs my life

739
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:07,002
You can't get
Wasim Khan by pledging me

740
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:10,005
Is it a Tamil's arrogance?

741
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:14,509
No, Indian Arrogance

742
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:30,526
Colonel Sir

743
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,027
This is Rishi Kumar's wife

744
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:34,029
You can speak in Tamil

745
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:37,532
It is 3 days
since my husband is missing

746
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,035
His whereabouts are not known

747
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,539
You say Army, Military
You are all holding high ranks

748
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,540
But still you
can't trace my husband

749
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,543
Didn't he come for your work?

750
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:51,046
You assured for his security

751
01:20:51,581 --> 01:20:53,048
You don't even search for him

752
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,551
When will you trace my husband?

753
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:58,053
When will you release
that useless Wasim Khan

754
01:20:58,588 --> 01:20:59,555
and rescue my husband?

755
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:01,056
Do you know who is Wasim Khan

756
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:04,059
Who is he to me
I want my hubby back

757
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:05,561
He has killed 43 people

758
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:07,562
If we release him for your sake

759
01:21:08,097 --> 01:21:09,564
He may kill 43 more
Is that OK?

760
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:11,066
I want my hubby back

761
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,068
If we release him
he will kidnap someone else

762
01:21:13,603 --> 01:21:14,570
and ask us to release
50 persons from jail

763
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,071
What will happen to the Nation?

764
01:21:16,606 --> 01:21:17,573
I am not worried
about the Nation, but my hubby

765
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:19,074
Shut up

766
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:23,579
Who are you?
Aren't you born in India?

767
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:25,080
Is this not your Motherland?

768
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:27,082
Don't you have right in this soil?

769
01:21:27,617 --> 01:21:29,585
No honor? Is your
house important to you?

770
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,086
Is the Nation
not important to you?

771
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:35,579
Terrorists are trying
to disintegrate the nation

772
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,592
You care about your house only

773
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:39,094
Is the soil not important?

774
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:42,097
Do you know how
many people work in this camp

775
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:45,100
Do you know?
3000 persons

776
01:21:46,636 --> 01:21:48,103
Despite rain, snow and cold

777
01:21:48,638 --> 01:21:49,605
they are guarding the border

778
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,107
Their families
are 1000 miles far away

779
01:21:53,643 --> 01:21:55,611
If they too were like you
this nation would not exist

780
01:21:58,147 --> 01:22:00,115
Do you know
what's going on here? War

781
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,117
Do you know
how many perished so far?

782
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:04,620
Innocent soldiers
women, children and gullible

783
01:22:05,655 --> 01:22:07,623
Is your hubby important
than all these people?

784
01:22:08,658 --> 01:22:10,125
Instead of my hubby

785
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:13,128
if a Minister's son
or daughter was abducted

786
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:14,630
Will you tell the same?

787
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:19,635
Is a Minister's daughter
more valuable than others?

788
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:22,137
In what way
my hubby is inferior?

789
01:22:24,674 --> 01:22:27,142
Govt. Has assigned you
this rescue mission

790
01:22:27,677 --> 01:22:29,645
You are responsible
if anything happens to him

791
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,649
I won't leave this place
until you trace him

792
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:35,650
I won't leave you too

793
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:35,711
Hi rustic

794
01:23:38,748 --> 01:23:39,715
Darling!!

795
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:41,716
- I have brought you something
- What is it?

796
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:44,719
What is it?

797
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:46,221
Close your eyes
then only I will give

798
01:23:46,756 --> 01:23:47,723
Close your eyes

799
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:17,252
- Please give my clothes
make it fast, - I won't

800
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:19,754
Your village wife
will die in the chilling cold

801
01:24:22,792 --> 01:24:25,260
- Petticoat
- Nothing, come out with it

802
01:24:26,796 --> 01:24:29,765
- Gosh, I beg you to
- Come, - My God!!

803
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:58,794
- My dear fool!!
- I feel shy

804
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:05,289
- Whose sweater is this?
- Yours - Isn't it mine?

805
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:08,303
- Give it
- My God! - Give it

806
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:11,806
- No
- Give it

807
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:13,308
Don't run stop

808
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:17,813
- Am not I begging you?
- Stop, - What is this?

809
01:25:18,848 --> 01:25:22,306
- Got you
- No

810
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,827
My dear VILLAGER!

811
01:25:34,864 --> 01:25:36,331
Will you follow English?

812
01:25:37,366 --> 01:25:39,834
A little, tell me

813
01:26:16,906 --> 01:26:20,364
They are asking for time
to release Wasim Khan

814
01:26:23,913 --> 01:26:29,374
Your Govt. Wants proof
that you are alive

815
01:26:36,926 --> 01:26:37,893
They want to hear your voice

816
01:26:39,929 --> 01:26:44,889
Tell them if Wasim Khan
is not released I will be killed

817
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:50,906
Say it

818
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:03,418
Victory to India

819
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:16,932
Victory to India

820
01:27:33,983 --> 01:27:34,950
Victory to India

821
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:12,487
- Victory to India
- Javed

822
01:28:29,538 --> 01:28:34,999
Delay in release of
Rishi Kumar, Computer Engineer

<i>You are there in tears</i>

<i>When eyes are closed</i>

830
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,607
<i>You appear in the mind</i>

831
01:30:13,142 --> 01:30:17,602
<i>Tell, what happened?</i>

832
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:23,107

<i>Tears are rolling down, dear</i>

834

<i>The touch of breeze</i>

835
01:31:14,203 --> 01:31:16,171
<i>reminds me your saree</i>

836
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:19,173
Seeing tender flowers

837
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:21,175
<i>reminds me your body</i>

838
01:31:22,211 --> 01:31:24,679
<i>The silver stream speech</i>

01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:37,181
<i>No words when there is mouth</i>

843
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:42,186

<i>Tell, what happened?</i>

870
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:10,344
I want to meet Wasim Khan

871
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:12,847
Who?

872
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:15,850
The one who is in jail
That murderer

873
01:34:16,385 --> 01:34:19,354
Better to please
the opponent than the witness

874
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:23,346
Leave me alone
I am going back home today

875
01:34:23,892 --> 01:34:25,860
Don't want Wasim Khan and Kashmir

876
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:28,363
35 dependents are
there in the native place

877
01:34:28,897 --> 01:34:30,865
Even if you don't
come I will meet him

878
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,867
Why are you obstinate?

879
01:34:33,402 --> 01:34:36,371
Why do you insist
on meeting Wasim Khan?

880
01:34:36,905 --> 01:34:38,372
Will you take me there or not?

881
01:34:38,907 --> 01:34:41,375
No, I wish to stay alive

882
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:42,877
Leave me please

883
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:01,896
Are you so particular
about going there?

884
01:35:09,938 --> 01:35:11,405
He is coming

885
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:13,908
I am scared

886
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:24,418
Greetings Brother
No, Salaam Male kum

887
01:35:24,953 --> 01:35:26,420
Is everything OK?

888
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,428
Ask him to release my husband

889
01:35:35,964 --> 01:35:37,431
Sir, her...

890
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:39,934
Tell him

891
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,438
Sir, her husband is with your gang

892
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:45,439
Please release him

893
01:35:45,974 --> 01:35:46,941
Get lost!!

894
01:35:48,477 --> 01:35:50,445
Tell him, we were
married just 1 month back

895
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,447
Look at this sacred thread

896
01:35:52,981 --> 01:35:53,948
He is a good person

897
01:35:54,983 --> 01:35:57,451
Killing an innocent
can't be justified

898
01:35:57,986 --> 01:35:58,953
Are you Hindustani

899
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:01,956
We don't care
go away

900
01:36:02,491 --> 01:36:04,459
- He is asking us to leave Come on
- Tell him I won't go

901
01:36:04,993 --> 01:36:06,460
Tell him I want my hubby

902
01:36:06,995 --> 01:36:08,462
If they are angry with the Govt.

903
01:36:08,997 --> 01:36:10,464
Why do they torture my husband?

904
01:36:10,999 --> 01:36:12,466
Tell me what wrong he has done

905
01:36:13,502 --> 01:36:14,469
This is War

906
01:36:15,003 --> 01:36:16,470
War for the liberation of Kashmir

907
01:36:17,005 --> 01:36:17,972
He has killed a lot of innocents

908
01:36:18,507 --> 01:36:20,475
Including new born
babies without mercy

909
01:36:21,009 --> 01:36:21,976
That's why he is jailed here

910
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:23,478
But what err did my hubby do?

911
01:36:24,012 --> 01:36:25,479
Ask him why he
is captured by his men?

912
01:36:26,014 --> 01:36:26,981
Go, time is up

913
01:36:27,516 --> 01:36:28,483
They say the it is time
Let us go

914
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:30,484
Don't know why they kill innocents

915
01:36:31,019 --> 01:36:33,487
Can't they leave,
if they hate India?

916
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:36,490
Why are they avenging us?

917
01:36:37,025 --> 01:36:38,993
This is our goal and target

918
01:36:39,528 --> 01:36:40,995
We will do anything
to achieve it

919
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:42,997
What type of person are you?

920
01:36:43,532 --> 01:36:44,999
Destroying one life
to save another's

921
01:36:45,534 --> 01:36:47,001
How many more murders
will quench your thirst?

922
01:36:47,536 --> 01:36:48,503
Leave me

923
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:50,004
I want my hubby back

924
01:39:36,705 --> 01:39:38,673
Don't tempt me to kill you

925
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:41,175
I swear

926
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:03,758
Check upstairs

927
01:41:53,341 --> 01:41:54,308
Oh my love Roja where are you?

928
01:41:54,843 --> 01:41:55,810
Tears are rolling down dear

929
01:41:58,346 --> 01:41:59,313
Oh my love Roja where are you?

930
01:41:59,848 --> 01:42:00,815
Tears are rolling down dear

931
01:42:31,379 --> 01:42:32,346
How many people you have killed?

932
01:42:34,883 --> 01:42:35,850
Twenty?

933
01:42:36,885 --> 01:42:37,852
Thirty?

934
01:42:38,887 --> 01:42:40,354
- More than that
- Why?

935
01:42:41,890 --> 01:42:42,857
Liberation is our goal

936
01:42:44,392 --> 01:42:46,860
We are ordered by our leaders

937
01:42:47,896 --> 01:42:48,863
Who are the leaders?

938
01:42:50,398 --> 01:42:52,366
Are they from here
or the neighbouring nation

939
01:42:55,403 --> 01:42:56,870
Will you kill anyone
if asked by the leaders?

940
01:43:00,408 --> 01:43:01,375
He is your younger brother

941
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:02,877
Will you slay him
if you are asked to?

942
01:43:06,915 --> 01:43:07,882
I will do

943
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:09,383
Your younger sister?

944
01:43:10,418 --> 01:43:11,385
I will do

945
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:12,887
Your mother?

946
01:43:13,922 --> 01:43:15,890
- I will do
- Why?

947
01:43:16,424 --> 01:43:18,892
- Jehad
- What does it mean?

948
01:43:19,928 --> 01:43:20,895
You won't understand it

949
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,398
It is Holy War

950
01:43:25,433 --> 01:43:26,400
Against whom?

951
01:43:29,938 --> 01:43:30,905
Your India

952
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:35,398
Oh! Tamil's, don't cry
it will dawn

953
01:43:35,944 --> 01:43:37,912
Will holding a gun
solve your problems?

954
01:43:38,947 --> 01:43:41,916
Will killing without
mercy make everything OK?

955
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:43,417
What about the 3 lakh families

956
01:43:43,952 --> 01:43:45,419
who were living
in Kashmir for ages?

957
01:43:46,454 --> 01:43:48,922
Where will they go and survive?

958
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:51,425
Don't they own this soil?

959
01:43:52,961 --> 01:43:55,429
What about the hapless
infants without food and shelter?

960
01:43:56,965 --> 01:43:58,432
Is it fair
to drive the inhabitants

961
01:43:58,967 --> 01:44:00,935
of a house and claim ownership?

962
01:44:05,473 --> 01:44:07,441
Wandering with guns
for someone's call

963
01:44:09,477 --> 01:44:11,445
Blindly instigated
by foreign nations

964
01:44:13,481 --> 01:44:14,948
You are destroying
your own people

965
01:44:15,984 --> 01:44:18,953
The most invaluable
thing in the world is life

966
01:44:19,988 --> 01:44:20,955
You are losing it

967
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:24,458
Life is not important
to us, Kashmir is important

968
01:44:25,994 --> 01:44:26,961
Your life itself isn't your own

969
01:44:27,996 --> 01:44:29,463
You have no right
on someone else's life

970
01:44:30,498 --> 01:44:31,965
Your problem
can be solved through talks

971
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:34,968
This won't be solved through talks

972
01:44:35,503 --> 01:44:36,470
This will be solved by separation

973
01:44:37,505 --> 01:44:38,472
Won't be separated

974
01:44:39,507 --> 01:44:40,474
India won't split

975
01:44:46,514 --> 01:44:49,483
Chenbagam Sister
Hope you are living happily

976
01:44:51,519 --> 01:44:53,487
and good things
are happening to you

977
01:44:55,023 --> 01:44:56,490
I must have
committed a grave sin

978
01:44:57,525 --> 01:44:59,493
Otherwise why should I
suffer like this

979
01:45:01,029 --> 01:45:01,996
I am unable to bear

980
01:45:04,032 --> 01:45:06,000
Visiting here everyday

981
01:45:07,035 --> 01:45:08,502
Hoping to receive some information

982
01:45:09,537 --> 01:45:12,005
A belief that they
will trace him somehow

983
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:15,509
I am panic stricken

984
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:19,012
I have no idea
about his whereabouts

985
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:23,517
Searching every
place with his photo

986
01:45:25,553 --> 01:45:28,522
hoping that someone
would recognise him

987
01:45:30,058 --> 01:45:31,025
Yet to find a clue

988
01:45:33,061 --> 01:45:35,529
But I will not
come back without him

989
01:45:37,565 --> 01:45:39,533
Sister, please encourage me

990
01:45:40,568 --> 01:45:42,536
Sister, encourage me to trace him

991
01:45:45,573 --> 01:45:49,031
How is Roja?
Has his hubby come back?

992
01:45:51,079 --> 01:45:53,547
Who has abducted our son-in-law?

993
01:45:54,082 --> 01:45:57,540
If all of us go there,
can't we bring him back?

994
01:45:58,586 --> 01:46:00,554
Any information
about Roja's husband?

995
01:46:01,089 --> 01:46:02,056
What man?

996
01:46:03,091 --> 01:46:05,059
Someone has abducted
the son-in-law of our village

997
01:46:05,593 --> 01:46:08,061
You are wasting your time here

998
01:46:08,596 --> 01:46:10,564
Try and do something

999
01:46:18,106 --> 01:46:20,574
For rescuing hostage
engineer Rishikumar

1000
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:24,078
Kashmir terrorist leader
Wasim khan can't be released

1001
01:46:24,612 --> 01:46:27,080
Decides high level
committee of central Govt

1002
01:46:27,615 --> 01:46:29,583
Abduction of celebrities and release of terrorists

1003
01:46:30,118 --> 01:46:32,086
in lieu of that are to be prevented and this

1004
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:35,589
decision is in line
with that, said the official

1005
01:46:46,134 --> 01:46:47,101
Liyakath, kill this betrayer

1006
01:46:48,636 --> 01:46:51,605
Their Govt. Has
refused to release Wasim Khan

1007
01:47:27,675 --> 01:47:29,643
<i>Community may vary
but virtue is same</i>

1008
01:47:30,178 --> 01:47:32,646
<i>Place may vary
but land is same</i>

1009
01:47:33,181 --> 01:47:35,649
<i>Language may vary
but voice is same</i>

1010
01:47:36,184 --> 01:47:38,152
<i>Staff may vary
but flag is same</i>

1011
01:47:38,686 --> 01:47:40,654
<i>Direction may vary
but land is same</i>

1012
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:43,157
<i>Music may vary
but sound is same</i>

1013
01:47:43,691 --> 01:47:47,149
<i>Our India is one and one only</i>

1014
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:05,168
<i>Modern India is common
Hard toils created it</i>

1015
01:48:05,713 --> 01:48:10,173
<i>It was created
with diversity as manure</i>

1016
01:48:10,718 --> 01:48:13,186
<i>So is strong as a subcontinent</i>

1017
01:48:13,721 --> 01:48:18,181
<i>Oh human! It is strong
Separation not in this land</i>

1018
01:48:18,726 --> 01:48:20,694
<i>Rise up</i>

1019
01:48:40,248 --> 01:48:42,216
- Who is that?
- It's me Achu

1020
01:48:48,756 --> 01:48:49,723
What?

1021
01:48:51,259 --> 01:48:54,717
- Colonel asked me to bring you
- Where?

1022
01:48:55,763 --> 01:48:58,732
Come... just to identify...

1023
01:48:59,767 --> 01:49:00,734
Who? What happened?

1024
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:05,239
Nothing, you come, I will tell you

1025
01:49:05,773 --> 01:49:06,740
Tell me in detail

1026
01:49:07,275 --> 01:49:08,742
Please come, I will tell you

1027
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:52,286
Why did you bring me here?

1028
01:49:53,821 --> 01:49:56,289
Someone with
bullet pierced at 5 or 6 places

1029
01:49:56,824 --> 01:49:58,291
Even face is not identifiable

1030
01:49:59,327 --> 01:50:01,295
That's why I brought you here

1031
01:50:03,831 --> 01:50:06,800
You have to identify correctly

1032
01:50:14,342 --> 01:50:15,309
Come

1033
01:50:19,347 --> 01:50:20,314
I won't come

1034
01:50:21,849 --> 01:50:22,816
Achu I won't go

1035
01:50:23,351 --> 01:50:24,318
- That's not my husband
- Come

1036
01:50:26,354 --> 01:50:28,322
I know, that's not him

1037
01:50:28,856 --> 01:50:30,323
Ask them to search for him

1038
01:50:35,363 --> 01:50:37,331
I know, I will not look at it

1039
01:51:00,888 --> 01:51:02,355
It's not him

1040
01:51:05,393 --> 01:51:06,360
It's not him

1041
01:51:08,896 --> 01:51:09,863
It's not him

1042
01:51:15,403 --> 01:51:18,861
Didn't I tell you?
Nothing will happen to him

1043
01:51:20,908 --> 01:51:21,875
It is not him

1044
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:24,378
It is not him

1045
01:51:26,914 --> 01:51:28,882
Nothing will happen to him

1046
01:52:47,495 --> 01:52:48,462
Going across the border

1047
01:52:50,498 --> 01:52:51,465
For training

1048
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:44,518
Sir

1049
01:53:45,553 --> 01:53:47,020
She is Mrs. Rishikumar

1050
01:53:47,555 --> 01:53:49,523
Wife of the abducted engineer

1051
01:53:51,058 --> 01:53:53,526
She wants to meet
the minister for a minute

1052
01:53:54,061 --> 01:53:55,528
Minister has a meeting at Jammu

1053
01:53:56,063 --> 01:53:57,030
You can't meet him now

1054
01:53:57,565 --> 01:54:00,033
Give me the petition
I will hand over to the minister

1055
01:54:09,577 --> 01:54:13,035
Sir I want to meet
the minister for 2 minutes

1056
01:54:14,081 --> 01:54:15,548
Will you please take me to him?

1057
01:54:17,585 --> 01:54:18,552
I am begging you

1058
01:54:37,605 --> 01:54:39,573
Beti, I understand your problem

1059
01:54:42,109 --> 01:54:43,076
You are calling me "Beti"

1060
01:54:44,111 --> 01:54:46,079
Doesn't Beti mean Daughter?

1061
01:54:46,614 --> 01:54:48,081
I plead like your own daughter

1062
01:54:48,616 --> 01:54:50,083
Please rescue my husband

1063
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:52,085
She is asking you
to rescue her husband

1064
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:54,588
Born and brought up
in a rural village of Tamilnadu

1065
01:54:55,122 --> 01:54:58,091
I don't understand
this language, this situation

1066
01:54:58,626 --> 01:54:59,593
I don't understand politics

1067
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:04,597
Someone was murdered

1068
01:55:05,132 --> 01:55:06,599
I was asked to identify
if it is my husband

1069
01:55:09,136 --> 01:55:10,103
Unbearable

1070
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:15,108
Negotiations are going on
Said it will take few more days

1071
01:55:16,143 --> 01:55:17,610
What if time lapses like this?

1072
01:55:18,145 --> 01:55:19,612
If something happens
to him before that

1073
01:55:21,148 --> 01:55:25,107
I am unable
to wait in anticipation

1074
01:55:26,654 --> 01:55:28,622
Many days passed
since his abduction

1075
01:55:30,157 --> 01:55:31,624
We are not Very lmportant People

1076
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:35,128
Are we not Indian Citizens?

1077
01:55:36,163 --> 01:55:38,131
Shouldn't the Govt. Protect us?

1078
01:55:38,666 --> 01:55:39,633
See daughter

1079
01:55:41,168 --> 01:55:42,635
It is all in your hands

1080
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:44,637
You have to rescue him

1081
01:55:46,173 --> 01:55:47,640
I trust you like God

1082
01:55:48,676 --> 01:55:51,144
Please don't say, No

1083
01:55:53,681 --> 01:55:55,148
Please rescue my husband

1084
01:55:56,684 --> 01:55:59,653
We are trying our level best

1085
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:25,678
Yesterday evening
at the Indian border

1086
01:56:26,213 --> 01:56:28,181
13 armed youth from Kashmir

1087
01:56:28,716 --> 01:56:30,684
were shot dead by Pakistani Army

1088
01:56:31,218 --> 01:56:33,186
when they tried
to cross the border

1089
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:35,188
This unreasonable action has caused

1090
01:56:35,723 --> 01:56:39,682
utter dissatisfaction
among Kashmiri's

1091
01:56:40,227 --> 01:56:42,695
The situation in Kashmir is tense

1092
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:47,189
There were rallies in protest

1093
01:57:40,788 --> 01:57:41,755
Your younger brother
was a good person

1094
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:44,257
Good hearted

1095
01:57:47,294 --> 01:57:48,261
It should not have
happened to him

1096
01:57:49,797 --> 01:57:50,764
Betrayal

1097
01:57:51,799 --> 01:57:54,267
Fight against India

1098
01:57:55,803 --> 01:57:58,271
We will see the rest
That's what we were told

1099
01:57:59,807 --> 01:58:00,774
Now

1100
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:10,272
They have shot our boys to death

1101
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:14,287
Not only my younger brother

1102
01:58:16,824 --> 01:58:17,791
13 persons

1103
01:58:20,828 --> 01:58:23,797
All were 15 year old boys

1104
01:58:25,332 --> 01:58:26,299
Betrayal

1105
01:58:27,835 --> 01:58:31,293
We fought all
these days, for what?

1106
01:58:38,345 --> 01:58:39,312
This blood

1107
01:58:41,849 --> 01:58:42,816
This violence

1108
01:58:44,351 --> 01:58:45,318
This extremism

1109
01:58:46,353 --> 01:58:48,321
Why don't you stop it
when you know it's wrong?

1110
01:58:49,356 --> 01:58:50,823
We are at half way in war

1111
01:58:51,859 --> 01:58:52,826
Can't retreat now

1112
01:58:56,363 --> 01:58:57,830
Whether we are right or wrong

1113
01:58:58,866 --> 01:58:59,833
We must fight

1114
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:04,337
Let the enemy be good or bad

1115
01:59:04,872 --> 01:59:06,339
He should be killed

1116
01:59:07,875 --> 01:59:09,843
Liyakath, you pray
for 4 times a day

1117
01:59:10,878 --> 01:59:11,845
Tell me honestly

1118
01:59:13,380 --> 01:59:15,348
The extremism
and other atrocities done by you

1119
01:59:16,383 --> 01:59:17,350
Will your God Allah accept it?

1120
01:59:20,888 --> 01:59:22,856
Will your religion accept homicide?

1121
01:59:30,397 --> 01:59:33,855
Today these 13 boys got killed
Are we happy about it?

1122
01:59:36,904 --> 01:59:38,371
Leave the guns and terrorism

1123
01:59:43,410 --> 01:59:44,877
Be a human than a terrorist

1124
02:00:08,936 --> 02:00:10,403
Has anything happened to him?

1125
02:00:10,938 --> 02:00:12,405
Did they do anything to him?

1126
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,907
Wasim Khan is going to be released

1127
02:00:15,943 --> 02:00:17,410
Decision was taken at Delhi

1128
02:00:17,945 --> 02:00:19,412
Your husband will be back

1129
02:00:20,447 --> 02:00:21,914
- Is it true?
- It is true

1130
02:00:24,451 --> 02:00:27,909
Your appeal
to the minister is fruitful now

1131
02:00:28,956 --> 02:00:30,423
Wasim Khan was
caught after 35 days search

1132
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:32,925
Now his handcuffs
will be removed and sent off

1133
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:34,427
Is that enough?

1134
02:00:39,967 --> 02:00:40,934
Do you know why?

1135
02:00:42,970 --> 02:00:43,937
I am happy

1136
02:00:47,474 --> 02:00:48,941
You are going to
get back your husband

1137
02:00:49,977 --> 02:00:50,944
You are happy

1138
02:00:56,984 --> 02:00:58,451
A scientist is
going to be retrieved

1139
02:00:59,987 --> 02:01:01,454
Politicians will get a good name

1140
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,957
They are also happy
HAPPY

1141
02:01:05,993 --> 02:01:06,960
Very happy

1142
02:01:11,999 --> 02:01:13,466
A person who was
caught after a hard chase

1143
02:01:14,001 --> 02:01:14,968
will go Scot free

1144
02:01:21,508 --> 02:01:24,477
15 personnel clad in uniform

1145
02:01:26,513 --> 02:01:29,482
Lost their lives while
attempting to capture him

1146
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,987
Their sacrifice is a waste now

1147
02:01:35,022 --> 02:01:35,989
Happy

1148
02:01:39,526 --> 02:01:40,493
Very happy

1149
02:01:46,533 --> 02:01:47,500
That Wasim Khan will come out

1150
02:01:48,535 --> 02:01:50,002
and will kill more people

1151
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,007
Very happy

1152
02:02:17,564 --> 02:02:19,031
He is coming back

1153
02:02:22,069 --> 02:02:23,536
He will be back

1154
02:02:28,075 --> 02:02:30,043
I told you earlier
Achu's prediction is right

1155
02:02:30,577 --> 02:02:32,044
that he will be back for sure

1156
02:02:44,591 --> 02:02:47,560
By God's grace
Wasim Khan will be released

1157
02:02:55,602 --> 02:02:58,571
Your life
is valuable to your Govt.

1158
02:02:59,106 --> 02:03:01,074
For your sake
they are releasing Wasim Khan

1159
02:04:47,214 --> 02:04:48,681
Take him back
and lock him up

1160
02:04:49,216 --> 02:04:50,683
So that he doesn't escape

1161
02:04:51,718 --> 02:04:54,687
Some other day
if not today, we will be liberated

1162
02:04:55,222 --> 02:04:56,689
and you will witness it

1163
02:05:19,746 --> 02:05:21,213
Why did they do like this?

1164
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,717
Where is he?

1165
02:05:27,254 --> 02:05:28,721
Why did they not bring him here?

1166
02:05:47,774 --> 02:05:49,241
I hoped to unite you
with your hubby somehow

1167
02:05:54,281 --> 02:05:55,248
Please don't say so

1168
02:05:56,283 --> 02:05:57,250
Nothing has happened to him

1169
02:05:58,285 --> 02:06:00,253
Did you see
anything happening to him?

1170
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:04,757
You have seen
only his blood stains

1171
02:06:06,293 --> 02:06:09,262
But nothing has
happened to him, I know

1172
02:06:11,298 --> 02:06:13,766
My mind says
that he is still alive somewhere

1173
02:06:17,304 --> 02:06:18,271
I will not be daunted

1174
02:06:19,306 --> 02:06:20,773
I will somehow trace him out

1175
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:24,777
Where will you search?

1176
02:06:26,813 --> 02:06:28,781
Going to visit
each and every terrorist's house

1177
02:06:29,816 --> 02:06:31,784
Won't there be women like me?

1178
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:36,288
I will beg to them
or will brave out

1179
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:41,783
I am not scared
anymore, I won't be afraid

1180
02:06:43,830 --> 02:06:44,797
Wait

1181
02:06:49,336 --> 02:06:50,303
I will accompany you

1182
02:06:51,838 --> 02:06:54,306
Until we find your
hubby, I will be with you

1183
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:45,858
Hey! Ensure that he doesn't escape

1184
02:07:46,893 --> 02:07:48,861
I'll go this way
Don't let him slip

1185
02:12:39,185 --> 02:12:40,152
What are you going to do?

1186
02:12:44,691 --> 02:12:45,658
You cannot kill me

1187
02:12:48,194 --> 02:12:49,161
When your younger brother died

1188
02:12:51,197 --> 02:12:52,164
I noticed how you wept

1189
02:12:55,702 --> 02:12:57,169
This terrorism is a camouflage

1190
02:12:58,705 --> 02:12:59,672
Deep inside you are a human

1191
02:13:02,208 --> 02:13:03,175
You are a man with conscience

1192
02:13:04,711 --> 02:13:05,678
You cannot kill me

1193
02:13:25,231 --> 02:13:26,198
I am going

1194
02:13:29,736 --> 02:13:30,703
Do whatever you like

1195
02:13:55,261 --> 02:13:56,228
Go

1196
02:14:02,769 --> 02:14:03,736
Go

1197
02:14:15,281 --> 02:14:16,748
You have reformed a terrorist

1198
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:05,858
VILLAGER!

1199
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:57,899
<i>Oh! Tamil
tomorrow is ours</i>

1200
02:16:59,445 --> 02:17:03,404
<i>Oh! Tamil
the nation is also ours</i>

1201
02:17:05,451 --> 02:17:09,410
<i>Oh! Tamil

1202
02:17:10,957 --> 02:17:14,916
<i>Oh! Tamil

1203
02:17:16,963 --> 02:17:21,923
<i>Say my house is
Mother Tamilnadu</i>

1204
02:17:22,969 --> 02:17:27,429
<i>Be firm that
you are an Indian</i>

1205
02:17:28,474 --> 02:17:31,932
<i>Oh! Tamil
tomorrow is ours</i>

1206
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:37,438
<i>Oh! Tamil
the nation is also ours</i>

1207
02:17:47,994 --> 02:17:49,962
<i>Community may vary
but virtue is same</i>

1208
02:17:50,496 --> 02:17:52,964
<i>Place may vary
but land is same</i>

1209
02:17:53,499 --> 02:17:55,467
<i>Language may vary
but voice is same</i>

1210
02:17:56,002 --> 02:17:57,970
<i>Staff may vary
but flag is same</i>

1211
02:17:58,571 --> 02:18:01,039
<i>Direction may vary
but land is same</i>

1212
02:18:01,507 --> 02:18:03,475
<i>Music may vary
but sound is same</i>

1213
02:18:04,010 --> 02:18:05,978
<i>Our India is one and one only</i>

1214
02:18:17,523 --> 02:18:21,482
Oh! Tamil
Don't shed tears

1215
02:18:23,029 --> 02:18:27,489
It will dawn
Don't get distressed

1216
02:18:29,035 --> 02:18:32,493
Oh! Tamil
Don't shed tears

1217
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:37,998
It will dawn
Don't get distressed

1218
02:18:40,546 --> 02:18:45,506
Is there an Indian's blood in you?

1219
02:18:46,052 --> 02:18:51,012
The United India will protect you

1220
02:18:51,557 --> 02:18:55,516
Oh! Tamil
tomorrow is ours

1221
02:18:57,563 --> 02:19:01,021
Oh! Tamil
the nation is also ours

1222
02:19:11,577 --> 02:19:13,545
Modern India is common to all
