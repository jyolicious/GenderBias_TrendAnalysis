1
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,644
We're told that names of your party
members figure in the Jain diaries.

2
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:34,944
So what's new?

3
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:38,474
Let the other diary be opened...
and see the names popping out.

4
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,045
What?! Are we going to have
another scandalous diary?

5
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,720
It's not the diary. It's politics;
Politicians have all been exposed.

6
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,126
All politicians will be imprisoned
now for the bribes they've taken.

7
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,858
Then what are we to do about it?

8
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:55,425
Let's form a Corporation;
Everybody else is doing it, too.

9
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:59,262
That will even help your unaccounted
money be effectively invested.

10
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:04,637
Let's make movies and TV-serials...
We can always find good stories.

11
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:09,477
Never mind that... Let's wrap up
this story first, Godbole.

12
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,209
I'm prepared, Sir... I'm only
waiting for the violence to begin.

13
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:21,183
We will not given in...
We will have our land!

14
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:39,773
- What is your name?
- Sachdev...

15
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,570
I've met you 13 times
in the last 3 months!

16
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,474
And you have asked me my name
each of those times!

17
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,819
You always managed to remember my
name during your election campaigns.

18
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,214
You have forgotten everything now...
including our problems!

19
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:56,550

 remember your problem. You want
possession of a land somewhere that...

20
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:59,524
Not a land "somewhere", Mr. Patel...
I'm only talking of Gol Chowk!

21
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,560
The place where we have earned our
livelihood for the last 10 years.

22
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,764
It feeds no less than a hundred
and fifty families!

23
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:08,836
And what was the place earlier?

24
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:12,665
Dumping ground of the city's refuse!
Where snakes and scorpions bred!

25
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,842
People were even scared
to venture out there.

26
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:17,910
We have toiled to give it the
respectability of a marketplace.

27
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,842
We have ourselves cleaned the
place of the dirt and refuse!

28
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,212
- He's right!
- And now...

29
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:24,480
...we're being uprooted from there
and driven out!

30
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,687
Only because Katiya can make a
huge shopping-complex there?!

31
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,990
Why can't you understand
the problem?

32
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,091
The Government will have do make
inquiries. So what's wrong?

33
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:36,528
And what do you wish to
inquire about?!

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,598
If you're really so keen...

35
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,705
...go and take a look in our homes;
we haven't cooked for days!

36
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:46,440
We survive on our daily-earnings,
Mr. Patel.

37
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,142
And our shops have been closed
for 20 days now!

38
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:51,344
Katiya's thugs flex their
muscles in broad-daylight...

39
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,778
...making it difficult for our kids
and womenfolk to move about freely!

40
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,820
Had we helped you win the elections
and voted you to power...

41
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,386
...only to face the police's caning,
without even being heard?

42
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:04,990
Do you want us to remain silent
when your people pelt stones...

43
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,061
It was your goons, and not our people
who pelted the stones! Understand?!

44
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:09,062
Now wait... calm down!

45
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,601
They're all with Katiya!

46
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:17,373
They have a share in the shopping
mall Katiya will build there!

47
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:18,870
- Come to your senses...
- It's you...

48
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,270
...who has to be brought
to your senses, Inspector!

49
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,941
Listen carefully, Mr. Patel...

50
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,808
We have our roots
deep in that place.

51
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,483
You just can't evict us
from Gol Chowk!

52
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,221
In your very presence, we shall
go on a hunger-strike...

53
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,120
...with our wives and children.

54
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,863
If death is what we're destined to
get, we will choose how we die!

55
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,132
The rest is for the
Lord to decide.

56
00:04:55,345 --> 00:05:00,306
We have a problem indeed.
We must meet Katiya soon.

57
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,980
Who the hell is Katiya
to decide our destiny?

58
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:07,788
We own the shops, the land,...
and slog on them!

59
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,858
Then why must we
grovel before anyone?

60
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:14,587
Where's the question of grovelling?
You simply don't understand this!

61
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:17,300

 suggest we settle this without
a fight, if that's possible.

62
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,026
It's because of your attitude
that we've reached this stage!

63
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:25,104
When Katiya's brother first came
here to collect protection money...

64
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,673
...l was against it even then!

65
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,436
I had strongly advised them
against paying up.

66
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:32,047
But they said then, that it was
a question of only two Rupees...

67
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,081
...and it was better
to settle it peacefully.

68
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,112
But it wasn't just
a question of 2 Rupees.

69
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:40,153
It had to do with acknowledging
Katiya's authority!

70
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,221
We were bowing to his might...and
that is what eventually happened!

71
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,426
Their demands for money continued
to increase. So much so...

72
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:49,928
...that he now wants to uproot us
from our dwellings!

73
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,725
But, do you think a hunger-strike
will serve the purpose?

74
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:54,402
We're not political leaders...

75
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,970
...who'll be offered lime-juice
to end the agitation.

76
00:05:57,207 --> 00:05:59,574
- He's right!
- We'll only rot here...

77
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,143
- ...and eventually die.
- So, go ahead and die!

78
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:05,974
We must prove to them that
we are prepared to die!

79
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:09,250
That they cannot scare us with
threats of impending death!

80
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:13,717
We will not vacate this place,
come what may!

81
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:57,723
I think we must..

82
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,563
That's a special "soldier"
from Katya's force.

83
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:05,535
Stopping getting scared... it's here
only to escort us to Katiya.

84
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:11,543
The man's fond of many such things.
How can 
 tell you of everything?

85
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:15,077
This way... there's a special
program underway in there.

86
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,753
Is it a cabaret? Or is it
a nautch-girl's dance?

87
00:07:18,822 --> 00:07:21,792
You're lucky, the soldier didn't
hear that. Or he'd have mauled you.

88
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:29,129
The fights and thrills of movies
and videos just don't excite Katiya.

89
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,458
Then what does?

90
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,600
He gets a kick out of seeing death...
from handing it out to a live person!

91
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,130
He sets man against man;
animal against animal...

92
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,726
And sometimes, an animal
against man, too!

93
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,137
He gets a kick out of
seeing blood being shed.

94
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,199
He rewards those who
emerge victorious...

95
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,433
...and enrolls them in his gang.

96
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:14,701
What about the ones
who lose?

97
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:31,526
This thug of yours has
lost to me, Katiya!

98
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,190
Do you still have someone
strong enough to challenge me?

99
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,593
Hold it!

100
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,667
Haven't 
 often told you...

101
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:48,177
...not to use these
weapons of the cowards...

102
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,472
...to call yourself lion-hearted.

103
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:43,323
Have you seen for yourself
the might of my brothers?

104
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,461
They're lions... all my
six brothers are lions!

105
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,905
You have dared to challenge me
in my den and lose a duel.

106
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:55,105
Have him thrown in
the panther's cage.

107
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,007
As for you...

108
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:02,078
You have surrendered to the enemy
in spite of being my own man.

109
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,280
You have considered your life to be
more precious than my honor.

110
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,248
And 
 have no use for
such a meaningless life.

111
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:14,958
It'd be terribly difficult, should
they really go on a hunger-strike.

112
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,995
They've always stayed
there, Mr. Katiya.

113
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:20,225
But if 
 am pressurized any further,
I'll be helpless, too.

114
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,968
We have used threats
and intimidation...

115
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,731
...but Sachdev doesn't seem
to buckle under the pressure.

116
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:28,201
You've had a stroke of paralysis,
brother-in-law.

117
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,506
- What nonsense are you talking?!
- That's not nonsense! It's true...

118
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,683
The Law and the politicians have
always been his strong-arms.

119
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,410
When they both refuse to work,
doesn't it mean he's paralyzed...

120
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,417
Stop him, please! What's the
rot he's wishing for?!

121
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,850
He stays with us, for one.
And then acts smart, too.

122
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,527
Had we the good sense to throw
you out when your sister died...

123
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:47,130
...we wouldn't have had to
put up with your nonsense!

124
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:52,264
I'll kick him out this very moment
and throw a party to celebrate it!

125
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:55,566
Brother-in-law! 
 won't leave
my brother-in-law alone...

126
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:58,639
My sister told me before she died,
to always serve my brother-in-law...

127
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,537
...and to find
my place at his feet.

128
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,212
- Won't you get lost then?!
- Stop it... that's enough.

129
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:06,373
What did you say his name is?

130
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,882
Why must you alone take
the lead in this matter?

131
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:10,642
What's wrong now?

132
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:13,013
We'll face the same fate
as others do.

133
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:18,484
I'm not trying to be the leader; but
someone will have to bear the mantle.

134
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,390
- We'll have to speak up.
- 
 don't like this.

135
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:25,091
Do you just "don't like it"
or are you afraid for me?

136
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,498
I'm afraid, too.

137
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:32,034
- If one has to live in the world...
- I'm not bothered about the world.

138
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:36,267
All 
 know is that my world
revolves around you alone.

139
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:39,675
And I'm always worried
about you.

140
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,381
And the Lord above
worries about everyone.

141
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,322
Don't worry... do you think He'd
spare them, should something happen?

142
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:49,218
He'll make them account
for their deeds.

143
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,520
As for me... I'm only doing
my duty, Malti.

144
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,527
Let's leave the rest
to the Almighty.

145
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:58,868
Hurry up and drop the stuff home;
they must've already started it.

146
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,899
And make sure to have lots
of water before you come.

147
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,437
This is no ceremonial fast;
it's a hunger-strike.

148
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,535
"We will not vacate this land"

149
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,139
"We own this land;
it belongs to us"

150
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:49,847
Not!

151
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:55,015
No..! Don't!

152
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,970
<i>No! This can't bet</i>

153
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:12,665
Save him, somebody...!
He's dying!

154
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:16,812
Hear me! Listen to me, please!

155
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,921
<i>It's like this...
 don't think my
medicines are working on him now.</i>

156
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,224
But you can rush him to Mumbai
at the earliest...

157
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:58,524
...and admit him in some
big hospital.

158
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,132
He'll recover immediately.

159
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:05,934
And, fact is, your brother Shiv
stays in Mumbai too, doesn't he?

160
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:10,134
You've said what you have say;
let's face it!

161
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:12,577
But don't you know how Dad
hates modern medicine?

162
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:15,408
He claims to be brave; but he's
scared of a mere syringe!

163
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,248
Besides, who'd drill
the sense into him?

164
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,923
- You can do that, of course!
-1

165
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,927
Not me... you can do it instead!

166
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,389
- It can only be you!
- 1?1

167
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,602
He's your Dad, after all... and you
look after him so well, don't you?

168
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:36,135
It's settled then; talk to your Dad.
I've got to go and see a patient.

169
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,170
- That's the truth of the matter!
- Mr. Physician!

170
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,874
Now you're telling me, are you?

171
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,913
Just dressing in clean clothes
does not amount to hygiene.

172
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,240
You have to maintain a clean
neighborhood, too.

173
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,145
If each one of us maintains
cleanliness in our area...

174
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:52,014
...we'd easily have a clean city.

175
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:55,589
In the cleanliness drive undertaken
by Mahatma Gandhi

176
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,350
...I've joined him in cleaning
the filthiest of places.

177
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,424
And you folks...

178
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,662
-..if you think that's
below your dignity,...

179
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,195
...I'll personally sweep
this place tomorrow.

180
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,767
- That's not necessary, Sir...
- We'll do it on our own!

181
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:10,039
- How about the lane, Sir?
- That lane leading to the school...

182
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:11,503
...must be completed
at the earliest.

183
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:14,176
Meet the new officer at
the Municipality.

184
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:16,505
You must tell him
everything about me.

185
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:19,147
I've taken part in the freedom
struggle with Mahatma Gandhi.

186
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,282
I've even received a letter
of acknowledgement.

187
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:24,784
See how quickly the work gets
done, when you use my name.

188
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:29,225
Did you see my father around, Radhe?
He came this way, didn't he?

189
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,357
Oh, sure. He gave us a piece
of his mind just now.

190
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,629
He's gone to repeat the act
a little farther away!

191
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:39,431
You rascal! You're always playing...
why don't you go to school?

192
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:43,196
- Where's your father?
- Good-morning, Sir.

193
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,338
Why doesn't your son go
to the school, Hariya?

194
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:49,771

 drop him at the school everyday;
but he runs away from there.

195
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:53,004
I'm now thinking of making him
help me out in the fields.

196
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:55,718
Do you want to make an animal
out of him in those fields?!

197
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,113
Don't you know that Mr. Shastri

198
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:02,053
...swam across the river, with his
books on his head, to reach school?

199
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,089
And, eventually, he became the
Prime Minister of our country!

200
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:07,991
But why must this boy swim across
the river? His school is nearby.

201
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,596
Shut up, you idiot!

202
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:14,494
Now look; a man without education
is nothing short of an animal!

203
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:18,763
Just watch out, if your son
doesn't attend school from tomorrow!

204
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:20,999
You've been scolding me, Sir...

205
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,143

 wish you'd say something
to this boy, too.

206
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,842
Straighten up! What are you
wearing that silly grin for?!

207
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,712
The physician has
made it clear...

208
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:32,819
...that you'll have to
go to Bombay for your cure.

209
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:37,353
Which physician is that?
"Let's face it," eh?

210
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,892

 was the one who treated him
when he himself fell sick.

211
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:43,131
There's no need... I'll grind
some herbs for myself.

212
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:46,961
This is a question of your health,
father. It's no social-service.

213
00:19:47,136 --> 00:19:48,968
- God forbid, if something...
- Shut up!

214
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:50,899
You're getting to be
very smart, aren't you?

215
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,973
- 
 know why you refuse to go.
- Why is that?

216
00:19:54,176 --> 00:19:56,770
- 
 won't tell you.
- Go on... tell me!

217
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,946
-1 won't!
- Tell me, or you get a punch!

218
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,945
- You're terrified of the syringe.
- What?!

219
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:06,349
Listen carefully to what 
 say...

220
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:07,751
I will, when you
set my ear free!

221
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:11,553
Well, okay... 
 will not leave
my work behind and go to Bombay!

222
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:15,059
And if you ask me to go ever
again, I'll give you a punch!

223
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,098
Keep it up, Kashi!

224
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:22,467
Keep it up...
Get him...! Get him by the feet!

225
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,946
Get up, my son!

226
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,240
It's a question of
my honor, mind you!

227
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,851
Bravo!

228
00:20:41,357 --> 00:20:42,984
Keep it up! Bravo!

229
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,063
He's won!

230
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,230
Glory to the Lord!

231
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:02,676
Father?

232
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:08,247
Sit down, father... Go on.

233
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,920
You're coughing blood, father!

234
00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:18,086
Never mind... it's nothing!

235
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,957
You did a great job!
Bravo!

236
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:25,861
- Listen, Kashi...
- What is it?

237
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,127
Where were you all day?

238
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,102
- You haven't even had your food.
- 
 won't have it.

239
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,072
Why? Are you angry
with me?

240
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:39,407
- Yes, 
 am.
- But what's wrong?

241
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:41,741
I understand everything now...
I get it all!

242
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,349
You'd have left immediately for
Bombay, had Shiv asked you to.

243
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:47,520
Didn't you see how seriously ill
you were today? You even bled!

244
00:21:47,756 --> 00:21:50,623
You don't listen to me because
I'm not your own son.

245
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,292
Because you found me
at the river?

246
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:54,930
Don't you dare say such
a thing ever again!

247
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:58,156
- I'll throw you in the Ganges!
- I'll swim back to the shores.

248
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,902
- I'll throw you back again!
- And I'll swim back again...

249
00:22:01,103 --> 00:22:04,300
Or who'd look after you?
Who'd give you a leg-massage?

250
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,508
And who'd listen to
your scolding?

251
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:09,474
That's enough! You speak any
nonsense that comes to your mind!

252
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:11,806
You've begun talking a lot
of nonsense, of late.

253
00:22:13,616 --> 00:22:17,143
Very well. I'll go to Bombay.

254
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:19,978
But don't you dare say
such a thing again!

255
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:25,717
By the way, where will we
stay in Bombay?

256
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:29,395
- With Brother Shiv, of course!
- No way! Certainly not there!

257
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,657
He's an ass, of the first order!

258
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,958
It's 7 years since
he's left for Bombay!

259
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,604
He's married and even has a kid...
but he just doesn't return!

260
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,810
- He's become an ass!
- Shall 
 go and wire him?

261
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,274
First have your food. And you
can send the cable later.

262
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,913
- I'll send the wire first...
- You must eat first!

263
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,811
- I'll send the wire first, Dad!
- Listen... Kashi!

264
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:51,350
This chap's become an ass, too!

265
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,423
I've heard a lot about
your bravery.

266
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,718
The nation needs honest and
courageous officers like you!

267
00:22:58,994 --> 00:23:01,622
I'm only following
your teachings, Sir.

268
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:04,790

 pray to God for your recovery
and for your safe return.

269
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,265
I'll return soon. Actually, 
 wasn't
even prepared to go to Bombay.

270
00:23:08,504 --> 00:23:12,065
It's the physician who forced me
to go to Bombay for a cure.

271
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:17,108

 did that only to help you
recover quickly, Mr. Shambhu Nath.

272
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:20,747
- Let's face it, eh?
- That's right!

273
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:23,585
Let's go, Father. The train's
about to leave.

274
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:26,278
You idiot! Can the train
ever leave without me?!

275
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,014
Come on, father...

276
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:32,054
Very well then, gentlemen...
Glory to the Lord!

277
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,969
Wait, Kashi...
I've dropped my cap!

278
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,539
It's okay... I've found it.

279
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:53,207
The holy water...

280
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,957
We've even left the
city far behind!

281
00:24:07,563 --> 00:24:11,591
You've been driving away for
the last one hour, driver...

282
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:15,003
You know your way around,
don't you?

283
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:17,064
Can't you hear me?

284
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:21,172
I hope you know where
we are headed, driver!

285
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,806
I know it! 
 know everything!

286
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:31,851
How am 
 to blame for the fact that
the city is spread out so much?!

287
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:35,055
Am 
 at fault, just because
your son stays far away?

288
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:39,522
I'll take you the right address...
But just keep quiet! Okay?

289
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:42,160
- Just talk to him, Mister...
- That's okay!

290
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:44,191
Just shut up now, okay?

291
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,304
We'd have made it to Mogal Sarai
from Benaras in so much of time.

292
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:53,776
I'm a smart man; I've been received a
letter acknowledging my achievements.

293
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,669
I've even spent some time
with Gandhi.

294
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,310
Don't try to fool me, okay?

295
00:24:57,613 --> 00:25:00,241

 can see your meter
ticking away rapidly!

296
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,511
Why are you picking my brains?!

297
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,348

 don't even want any
money from you!

298
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:11,355
I'll pay you the equivalent
of the fare instead!

299
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,325
I'll think I've been on a pilgrimage;
that I've had a holy bath!

300
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,531
How can you wash away your sins
just like that?

301
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,225
You'd have to come to Benaras for
that and take a dip in the Ganges.

302
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:22,834
But you must come there.

303
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,540
I'll arrange a bath and a prayer
for you in the Harishchandra shrine.

304
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:28,642
Oh, sure...

305
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,175
...I'll come there; I'll bathe
and even shave my head bald!

306
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:35,248
But 
 will not drive any further!
Not anymore!

307
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:38,510
Listen, driver...! Listen...

308
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:42,914

 hope you've sent the telegram
to the right address.

309
00:25:43,392 --> 00:25:45,690
We've been walking away
like mad-men!

310
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:48,323
There isn't a human-being
in sight.

311
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,395
Have the people here been
scared away by the snakes?

312
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:55,065
Real fools you have
here in Bombay.

313
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:58,031
The bloody cabby
dropped us midway.

314
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,469
These guys don't even recognize
a person for what he's worth!

315
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:05,213
As for Shiv...T
Let me get my hands on him...

316
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:07,242
<i>-.I'll straighten him out
by the ears!</i>

317
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,142
Take a look at that, father!

318
00:26:09,418 --> 00:26:11,580
Our shop...

319
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,684
He's named the shop
after you.

320
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,555
My name, my foot!
He's mis-spelt my name!

321
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:23,526
He's clubbed Shambhu
and Nath together...

322
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:26,360
...whereas, they should
have been written separately.

323
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,363
But we've at least found
the shop, haven't we?

324
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,302
You don't want to pray before
a closed shop, do you?!

325
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:38,605
We wouldn't have had to go about in
the hot Sun, if Shiv had received us.

326
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,248
The hot Sun is sometimes
good for health, Father.

327
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:41,911

 could punch you for that!

328
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:46,846
The whole of the market is shut...
there's not a betel-vendor in sight.

329
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:50,025
- Go and find out.
- The betel-leaf vendor, eh?

330
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:52,421
Go and find the house,
you idiot! You're a fool!

331
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:56,096
You're absolutely
good-for-nothing!

332
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:03,430
And where are you taking
that box? Keep it here...

333
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:04,765
It has our money, Dad.

334
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:12,973
Who are you? Has Mahadev
(the Lord) sent you?

335
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:54,122
- No.
- You will die?

336
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,823
You will die, too...
They're all dead!

337
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:04,225
You will also die! There's no one
now... they're all gone!

338
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:11,833
Who are you?

339
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,236

 wonder what the ass
has gone and done!

340
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:17,877
What are you doing outside during
a curfew? Don't move... okay?

341
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,677
What are you doing?!
Go and sit down there!

342
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,180

 just can't figure out
what to do!

343
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,013
And all this had to happen today.
How will 
 go to the station?

344
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,815
- Open the door!
- Who's that?

345
00:28:29,024 --> 00:28:30,788
- The cops? Who?!
- Open up!

346
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:39,027
They claim to be your father
and brother. Do you know them?

347
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,361
- Recognize me, you idiot!
- Father! Welcome...

348
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:46,633

 wonder where they all come from,
to die in Bombay!

349
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,671
To die in Bombay?!

350
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,913
May you always lead
a happy married life.

351
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:55,115
Here you are, dear... it's the
holy water from the Ganges.

352
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:58,513
- How was the journey, father?
- It was rotten!

353
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,347
Why didn't you come to the
station to receive us?

354
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,421

 was actually about to come.
But, then...

355
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:05,424
That's enough!
Come to me, my son.

356
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:07,358
Hello! Kashi!

357
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:11,630
D'you know who 
 am?
I'm your grandfather.

358
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:13,629
And I'm the uncle.

359
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,361
- Allow me to touch your feet.
- Oh no! Don't do that!

360
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,538
No formalities. Sheila
doesn't care about these.

361
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:21,436
The city-bred hardly have
any regard for our customs.

362
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:26,610
Sheila! Why must you keep your
threads and needles lying about?

363
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:30,514
She was stitching, you see...

364
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,246
So you left home to
live in this hovel?

365
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,322
- How's your work going on?
- Fine.

366
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,498
By the way... I've already taken
an appointment from the doctor.

367
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,632
An appointment with the doctor?

368
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,995
Yes. It's for the pain in your
throat. You had written about it.

369
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,071
Oh yes. 
 did write to you.
But, I've only just arrived.

370
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:54,332
Let me relax for a few days.
The doctor comes later.

371
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,171
This is your house. You can live
here for as long as you wish.

372
00:29:57,312 --> 00:30:00,543
- Where's the toilet?
- Over there.

373
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,381
The toilet!
Right beside the kitchen?!?

374
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:15,823
- I'm scared!
- Are you scared of cats?

375
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:21,195
The cat comes to your
house and scares you!

376
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,099
You must chase it away.

377
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:26,671
- Let's shoo the cat away.
- We did it! Sent the cat scurrying!

378
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:28,410
Now open your mouth... wide.

379
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:31,038
Wider.

380
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:33,674
Wider, please.

381
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:36,944
I'm not a buffalo. 
 can't open
my mouth any wider.

382
00:30:37,152 --> 00:30:39,120
- Well, all right.
- Want to see anything more?

383
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,051
- No. That'll be enough.
- Go on, if you want to.

384
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,485
No. 
 needn't see any more.

385
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:45,353
You see...

386
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,585
- May 
 get up?
- Yes. You may.

387
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:52,425
I'm prescribing some medicines.

388
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,830
- May 
 put on my shirt?
- Yes. You may.

389
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:57,435
He had thrown up blood
in a coughing fit.

390
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,663
Wait a moment... I'll ask
him about everything.

391
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,771
Is everything all right?

392
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,538
Seems so. But he must be admitted in
a hospital for some examinations.

393
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:10,777
Admitted to a hospital?!
Is something serious?

394
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:13,317

 could say for sure
only after 
 get a report.

395
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:14,851
He must go through
these tests right away.

396
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:20,186
The test first. And then a report.
And then comes the treatment.

397
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,455
The medicine-man in
the village is better.

398
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:25,827
He could tell it all
by the pulse.

399
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,339
Please do not mind him.

400
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,065
How long will he
take to recover?

401
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:38,770

 can't say. You must have him
admitted to a hospital.

402
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,017
The deity is over there.

403
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,528
You've brought me to sin!
It was a rotten coconut!

404
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:37,704
The Lord will burn me alive!
And He won't spare you either!

405
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:45,906
The Lord is merciful. But incite
His anger, and He'll burn you alive.

406
00:32:47,782 --> 00:32:50,547
He doesn't spare anyone then.
He even burnt his spouse Parvati.

407
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,120
But, pray to Him, and He will
even give you back your life.

408
00:32:58,793 --> 00:33:02,195
Forgive Her, Lord.
For she does not know.

409
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:18,903
Watch it!

410
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,488
This is sub-judice. The court has
ruled that the shops may continue...

411
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:30,386
...to do business till the case is
decided. We can carry on business.

412
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,220
- Yes! That's right!
- You can't do this!

413
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:44,434
But the papers surely show
that you are the owner.

414
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:48,371
The papers mean nothing. That which
Katiya wants, is going to happen.

415
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:52,543
Why? Is he the Collector?

416
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,776
Please eat your food.

417
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,915
But who is Katiya?

418
00:33:58,186 --> 00:34:00,177
The local don.
He's a dangerous fellow.

419
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:02,421
He's trying to evict us.

420
00:34:02,757 --> 00:34:07,820
They are 7 brothers. Every man a
scoundrel. No one can touch them.

421
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:13,626
Who said so? For 200 years, the
English lorded over this country.

422
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,371
And everyone said that
no one can touch them.

423
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:22,568
Then came Gandhi. 
 was with him.
We fought for freedom and won it.

424
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:29,241
What a drubbing we gave the English!

425
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:31,977
My friend Sachdev used to
say things like that.

426
00:34:32,254 --> 00:34:33,688
And look at what happened to him!

427
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:35,686
He was killed like a dog.

428
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,653
His wife, the poor girl,
lost her mind after that.

429
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:42,454
He kills people like flies!

430
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:49,061
Nitwit! Must you speak so
before a child?

431
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:51,663
Now what's the matter
with the brave boy?

432
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,501
Katiya will kill all of us!

433
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:58,611
To hell with Katiya! Lord Rama
killed the 10-headed demon.

434
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:02,781
Our brave little boy will kill the
one-headed Katiya. Won't you, dear?

435
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:06,080
- Won't you kill him?
- Yes!

436
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,116
It's you!

437
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:12,519
Greetings!

438
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,291
I had heard that people
get lost in this city.

439
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:17,196
Nice meeting again.

440
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:22,893
- I'm new to this city.
- 
 see.

441
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,329
Just came in from Benaras.

442
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:29,338
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

443
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:30,736
I thought so.

444
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:37,747
- You seem to be working.
- Yes. I'm a nurse in a hospital.

445
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:40,383
- I'm in a hospital too.
- What?!

446
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:44,421

 mean to say that 
 take my father
to the hospital every other day.

447
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:45,955
He's suffering from
an ailing throat.

448
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,294
We're here for his
medical treatment.

449
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:53,326
How haven't 
 seen
you in the hospital?

450
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:57,094
Is there only one hospital
in Bombay?

451
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,076
- Are you going to the hospital?
- No. I'm after the city sights.

452
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:07,440

 had asked my brother
to take me out to town.

453
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,808
But he apologized saying "Kashi

454
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:13,178
I'm Kashinath.
People call me Kashi.

455
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:20,190
He gave me a list of the
bus-routes and told me...

456
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:26,399
- What's your name?
- Gauri; people call me that.

457
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:30,831
Well... that's how I'm supposed
to go about the city.

458
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:36,441
Bus no. 80 to Bandra.
No. 84 Ltd. to Haji Ali.

459
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:39,848
Goodness! 
 must try out
the fruit juices at Haji Ali!

460
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,105
Why are you laughing?

461
00:36:42,884 --> 00:36:47,788
Let me give you
a tour of the city.

462
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,156
- Really??
- Sure.

463
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,991
That'd be fun!

464
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:55,853
Won't you wait till
the bus arrives?

465
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,394
Sure!

466
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,943
That's the film star,
Amitabh Bachchan's house.

467
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:47,180
- You wanted to see it, didn't you?
- This is great, 
 say!

468
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:52,952
- Would brother be in now?
- Brother?!

469
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:56,414
Brother Amit (Amitabh Bachan,
the film star)

470
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,828
It's like this; he's actually from
Allahabad and I'm from Benaras.

471
00:38:00,228 --> 00:38:03,220
Both hail from towns on the banks of
the Ganges. Aren't we brothers then?

472
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:05,193
Oh sure... you're brothers indeed.

473
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,512
Would you like to convey
something to your fans?

474
00:38:24,118 --> 00:38:30,922
Only that religion and caste
be prevented from...

475
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:33,354
...leading to the division
of this great country.

476
00:38:33,795 --> 00:38:38,289
Actually, this nation is
a home for all of us.

477
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:41,326
We must try to live together
like a family.

478
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:44,172
We must care for the whole house...

479
00:38:44,506 --> 00:38:46,167
...and not just our own rooms.

480
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:49,567
Our rooms will remain intact, only
if the house itself is secure.

481
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,254
Looks like "brother"
has recognized you.

482
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,863
Why not? We're brothers, after all!

483
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,467
But it was fun, really!

484
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:28,547
- Don't look there! Please!
- Why not?

485
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,409
What a shame!

486
00:39:43,164 --> 00:39:45,292
Thief! Thief... Catch him!

487
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,332
Catch him, someone!

488
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:56,438
The swine was running away
with the purse!

489
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,137
- Your aim is amazing!
- What's so amazing?

490
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:04,045
That's how I knocked off a ripe
mango, among st raw ones, as a child.

491
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,945
- With such a little stone.
- 
 seel

492
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:08,849

 had a coconut today... and the
idiot's head was even bigger!

493
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,718
- 
 had to find my mark!
- It's really been fun!

494
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:14,491
You're right!
It's really been fun...

495
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,033
- It's over.
- Yes.

496
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,537
All the water in that
coconut is over!

497
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:30,568
- That's okay.
- Shall we move then?

498
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:38,276
Katya's expecting us,
isn't he?

499
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:40,985
Yes. 
 had sent word.

500
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,087
I'm told that anyone who comes
to Katiya with a grievance...

501
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,158
...is buried alive
in these pillars.

502
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:49,559
That's right! No one has ever
been seen walking out alive.

503
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:51,526
- Cut the nonsense! Just shut up!
- And where are you going?

504
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:56,534
The truth is that such people are
dangerous for the crooks...

505
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,762
..-.but they're straight
with decent folks.

506
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:59,462
We have nothing to fear.

507
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:02,435
It's only that the pillars
reminded me. Or 
 wouldn't...

508
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,008
Shut up! You always remember
the wrong things!

509
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:09,811
Don't move! Freezel

510
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:12,919
It's a soldier who's
come to fetch you.

511
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:14,751
Just follow it quietly.

512
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:18,892
- It's been tamed... Come along.
- Are we so easily dispensable?

513
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,443
What is it?

514
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:43,650
These people wish
to say something.

515
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:53,486
Actually... some thugs had come
to our shops, the other day.

516
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:02,667
What 
 mean is that some
folks came to our shops.

517
00:42:03,137 --> 00:42:04,502
Decent folks, actually...

518
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:08,035
Our shops don't run now...

519
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:11,239
It's very difficult because...

520
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,642
...they've piled up building
material before our shops...

521
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:17,013
- It's an obstacle, you see...
- If that were removed, we could...

522
00:42:20,655 --> 00:42:22,646
Talk to him about the
legal angle, Gopal...

523
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:25,857
Go on... speak!
What are you afraid of?

524
00:42:26,194 --> 00:42:29,994
- Not me, please!
- What he wants to say is that...

525
00:42:30,198 --> 00:42:32,098
...even the Courts
have ruled that...

526
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:37,460
The soldier hates someone talking
loudly to my brother-in-law.

527
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:45,102
What 
 wanted to say is that
even the Courts have ruled...

528
00:42:45,346 --> 00:42:47,371
Never mind that... The Court
has its own place.

529
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:53,416
We've been earning a livelihood in
your "empire" for 25 to 30 years.

530
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,089
Our shops are giving us
our bread and butter.

531
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,723
Anything that you decide...

532
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,190
The soldier also hates anyone
raising a finger at brother-in-law!

533
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:09,170
We will abide by any
decision that you make.

534
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:12,637
- He's right! Anything you say...
- Please consider our plight...

535
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:19,645
How many days had 
 given you
to have Gol Chowk vacated?

536
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:21,176

 was to have it vacated
in a month.

537
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,512
It's already a month, isn't it?

538
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,253
Cut-off one of your fingers then.

539
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:54,342
Running errands? People give
doctors the status of God.

540
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:56,583
But I'd place the nurse
in the same category, too.

541
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,181
How much you care
for the patients!

542
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:00,678
In fact, 
 think you nurses
ought to receive an award.

543
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:03,925
Let's skip this thing about me;
tell me about yourself.

544
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,250
What would you find in my story?

545
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:10,226

 was an infant when father found
me on the banks of the Ganges.

546
00:44:10,464 --> 00:44:12,296
He was the one who brought me up.

547
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:15,002
In fact, he loves me even more
than he loves his own son.

548
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:18,068
Brother Shiv would never
agree with me...

549
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:20,502
...but he loves me a lot, too.

550
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:25,244
They all love me. Father even wanted
me to study medicine or engineering.

551
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:27,880
But 
 was never really
cut out for studies.

552
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:30,846
And 
 now work in an
iron-products' factory.

553
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:33,150
Come to think of it, I'm very
"kuilified" and "elligent".

554
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:37,413
You mean, "qualified" and
"intelligent", don't you?

555
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:42,290
But Dad doesn't understand...
He always calls me dumb-headed.

556
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,031
Do 
 look dumb to you?

557
00:45:22,603 --> 00:45:30,603
13
Iy

558
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,481
It's a shame that you take
so much of time...

559
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:11,351
...to open the lock
of your own house!

560
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,493
A burglar would open it faster,
without a key!

561
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,924
That can't be, father...

562
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:21,624
It's an old lock. Which is why
the key gets stuck.

563
00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:23,735
Gets stuck, my foot!

564
00:50:24,004 --> 00:50:26,735
Kashi's a strange chap...

 wonder where he disappears.

565
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:30,600
Didn't your wife know we're
returning from the hospital?!

566
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:32,141
She should've been here!

567
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:34,211
She's gone to fetch
the kid from school.

568
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:36,415
She must've been caught
in a traffic-jam.

569
00:50:36,684 --> 00:50:38,311
Caught, indeed...
Get me a glass of water!

570
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:40,111
- Well, okay. Please sit down...
- Go on!

571
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,721
What a strange city, this Bombay!

572
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,620
You have people getting caught
in buses and local-trains!

573
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:52,989
The deadly diseases would kill
a man only later...

574
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,636
...but the crowds and the
pollution will get to him first!

575
00:50:57,271 --> 00:50:59,672
They just don't consider
you to be human.

576
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:03,077
They push a man in the crowded
local trains, against his wishes...

577
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:05,678
...and shove him out
without his will, too!

578
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,348
Father?! You're returned
very quickly from the hospital.

579
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:13,915
I'll give you a blow!

580
00:51:14,255 --> 00:51:17,555
Have 
 returned early or have
you returned late, you idiot?!?

581
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:20,853
- Where had you been?
- 
 was held up, Dad...

582
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:23,998
- Not you, too?!
- I'd actually been to meet someone.

583
00:51:24,265 --> 00:51:27,496
- Who's that you went to meet?
- Gauri... she's a nurse.

584
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:30,463

 was making friends with her;
she could be of help.

585
00:51:38,545 --> 00:51:41,537
You're back, are you?
And could you see the sights?

586
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:46,219
Actually, I'd asked him to go
and see the sights in the city.

587
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:51,948
Idiot! Is he here to see the sights
or have me treated?!

588
00:51:58,165 --> 00:52:02,466
I'm fed of making
the trip everyday.

589
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:05,128
Either have me admitted
in the hospital...

590
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,865
...or send me away to Benaras...

591
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:12,769
Have some water, father...

592
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,814
Really?! That's wonderful news,
my friend!

593
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:25,753
My father's terribly ill, Mister.
Please let us have a room.

594
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,026
I've already told you
so many times...

595
00:52:28,262 --> 00:52:30,526
...that there's no room for
any more patients in the hospital.

596
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:33,266
I'll join you, too!

597
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,264
There isn't much work here.
It can always be taken care of.

598
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:41,073
- The doctor has sent a note.
- Sent a note, eh?

599
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,470
Then have the patient admitted
in the doctor's house!

600
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:45,836
What can 
 do, when
there's no room?

601
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,946

 can't possibly have him
lying on my head, can 17!

602
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,989
- Have you got an admission?
- No; he says there's no room.

603
00:52:57,858 --> 00:52:59,758
Couldn't you manage it then?

604
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:02,824
Didn't you tell him who 
 am?

605
00:53:03,297 --> 00:53:05,766
I've fought the war for freedom
with Mr. Gandhi!

606
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:10,070
Where's Shiv?

607
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,003
He's gone to talk to someone, too.

608
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,270
Talk! Big deal! Can't you
do anything else, but talk?!

609
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,944
If you happen to know a ward-boy
or a maid in the hospital...

610
00:53:20,147 --> 00:53:22,707
...you could manage
to wrap this up quickly.

611
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,313
Well, never mind...

612
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:30,087
Take this... and go
and show it to him!

613
00:53:30,491 --> 00:53:32,687
Let me see how he still
refuses me an admission!

614
00:53:33,026 --> 00:53:34,118
Go on... Hurry up!

615
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:42,100
- Mister... Mister!
- What is it?

616
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,531
- Take a look at this.
- What is that?

617
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,931
It's a certificate of honor.

618
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:49,474
And what's this certificate
supposed to mean?

619
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:52,041
My father got this for the services
he rendered to the country.

620
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:53,643
It's for him that we need the room.

621
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,377
Yes, Sir? ... Very well, Sir...
I'll be on my way!

622
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:03,683
My father had joined Mr. Gandhi in the
battle for the nation's Independence.

623
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:07,360
Why did he fight for Independence?
What have we got out of it?

624
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:09,962
Those days of slavery were better
than these times of freedom!

625
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:11,993
The entire system has rotted!

626
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,664
And they bring certificates
of honor to the hospitals!

627
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,236
They should've sold it
in scrap instead!

628
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:20,735
Haven't 
 told you there's no room?
Please leave me alone!

629
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:24,744
There's no point in running
from pillar to post.

630
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,073
Bring a thousand Rupees and

 could pull a few strings.

631
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:30,714
If it's okay with you,
come to the rear-entrance.

632
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,464
You've got admission, haven't you?
Which room is it?

633
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:47,833
Answer me... which room
could you get?

634
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,004
Couldn't you manage it?
Useless chaps, you both are!

635
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,407
Didn't you show him
this certificate?

636
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:58,668
1 did! I did show him
the certificate!

637
00:54:58,946 --> 00:55:01,506
And he asked him to fling it
in the garbage can!

638
00:55:01,748 --> 00:55:04,274
Why did you ever have to
fight for our Independence?!

639
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:06,178
What has our Independence
given us?

640
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,888
When they don't care for the Gandhi
they pretend to revere, who are you?

641
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,685
Please calm down, Mister...

642
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:14,118
We have a man dying here...

643
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:16,763
...and that chap is busy
chatting away on telephone!

644
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,098
He's reading a novell!
And that pimp of his...

645
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:21,233
...asks for a thousand Rupees
for the admission!

646
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,337
- Sit down... please.
- Are we here for fun?!

647
00:55:24,638 --> 00:55:25,969
Is this a pleasure-trip?!

648
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:29,599
They just can't understand
a poor man's dilemma.

649
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:33,138
They treat us like animals!

650
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,882
They've made a slaughter-house
out of this bloody hospital!

651
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,346
The poor will die here,
on a bench like this...

652
00:55:40,554 --> 00:55:42,215
..-.but they still
wouldn't be concerned.

653
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:44,187
Hey, Kashi... what's up?
Calm down...

654
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:48,417
I've got the admission for Dad...
Let's go... Come on.

655
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:50,160
Come along...

656
00:56:00,974 --> 00:56:03,773
Tell Mr. Bharat that his
work will be taken care of.

657
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,935
But the supply of currency-notes
mustn't stop, okay?

658
00:56:09,182 --> 00:56:12,083
Here's Laxmi (the Goddess
of Wealth), Savitri.

659
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,651
Laxmi? Where is she?

660
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,948
It's the Goddess of Wealth...
the money, I'm talking about!

661
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:20,490
How often have 
 told you not to
give me the money you get in bribes?

662
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:23,787

 can very well manage
in the salary you earn.

663
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:26,065
- Get on with it, Pinky...
- There you go again!

664
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:30,667
I'm not earning it for myself, am 1?
It's only for my darling, Pinky...

665
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:33,033
...so that she can have all the
comforts and luxuries in life.

666
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,607
But you don't ever
stop nagging me!

667
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,902
That's because 
 always
have a fear in my mind...

668
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:43,582
...that your ill-gotten wealth could
shatter the happiness of our family.

669
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:44,808
Stop it now!

670
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:54,653
What brings you here?

671
00:56:54,962 --> 00:56:57,693
That's because some hooligans
ransacked Mishra's shop yesterday.

672
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:00,662
As for the police complaint,
we have already lodged it.

673
00:57:00,968 --> 00:57:05,496
But this morning, a couple of thugs
beat up his son very severely.

674
00:57:05,739 --> 00:57:09,573
It was a brutal beating, Sir...
They've broken his hand...

675
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:13,110
...and even cracked his skull.
Please do something, Sir...

676
00:57:13,447 --> 00:57:15,415
When we took his son to the
hospital, the doctor said...

677
00:57:15,616 --> 00:57:17,607
...it's a police case;
that we should lodge a complaint.

678
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,115
Since it all happened because of
the complaint he lodged yesterday...

679
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:24,087
...we don't know whether we should
lodge another complaint or not...

680
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:25,814
That's not really the problem.

681
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:30,087
But 
 can't engage a constable for
every person's security, can 1?

682
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,059
- You're right, Sir.
- Well, suppose...

683
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,566
-..
 post some constables
on duty at the square.

684
00:57:34,768 --> 00:57:37,999
The thugs would return and bash him
up, the minute the police leave.

685
00:57:38,238 --> 00:57:41,902
Actually it's that piece of land
which is causing problems.

686
00:57:42,242 --> 00:57:47,612
Vacate the place as soon as possible
and hand it over to Katiya...

687
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:49,111
...your problem will be solved.

688
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:53,716
The land and the shops belong
to these gentlemen, Inspector.

689
00:57:53,987 --> 00:57:57,719
Why don't you imprison those thugs,
instead of throwing these people out?

690
00:57:58,025 --> 00:58:00,153
Who's this man?

691
00:58:00,427 --> 00:58:02,452
This is Kashi; he's
come in from Benaras.

692
00:58:02,663 --> 00:58:04,153
He's Shiva's younger brother.

693
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:08,526
Shiv took his father to the hospital,
and his brother joined us instead.

694
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:11,635
It's always better to
come in groups, isn't it?

695
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:13,863
- Greet the Inspector.
- Now this is another problem!

696
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:17,202
What's happened to you, dear?
You're bleeding!

697
00:58:17,511 --> 00:58:19,570
The cursed blade! Why don't
you use the pencil-sharpener!

698
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,214
And what are you asking
silly questions for?!

699
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:23,145
Look! She's bleeding...

700
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:25,375
Don't just stand and watch!
Call the doctor...

701
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,213
Call him up and tell him
that we're coming there...

702
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,579
Don't worry, dear...
It'll be alright.

703
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,859
- She's hurt her finger.
- Must've bled a lot.

704
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:36,960
What will happen of my son?

705
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:40,723
We'll see about that later...
Shall we leave?

706
00:58:42,035 --> 00:58:45,164
Here we are at last!

707
00:58:45,405 --> 00:58:48,841
Hey, you! You'll get a punch!

708
00:58:49,476 --> 00:58:50,705
They're terribly rash drivers.

709
00:58:52,512 --> 00:58:56,608
This is our shop...
but is today a holiday?

710
00:58:56,817 --> 00:58:59,149
What holiday? All shops
on that side are open.

711
00:58:59,386 --> 00:59:02,879
But brother had told me
that we'd meet here.

712
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:05,318
And all shops on this side
are closed, too.

713
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:08,084
- Where could they have gone?
- They're all dead!

714
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:09,692
They're all dead!

715
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:14,130
Come closer... come on!

716
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:17,762
They're all dead...
I'm the only one alive.

717
00:59:19,406 --> 00:59:23,775
You must've been sent here
by the Lord, right?

718
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:26,978
This shop here belongs
to Sachdev.

719
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:31,082
It's our shop, you know!

720
00:59:31,418 --> 00:59:35,651
What are you looking for?
What do you want?

721
00:59:36,089 --> 00:59:38,854
You get everything here...
care for some bridal-wear?

722
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:40,220
The lady's a nut!

723
00:59:40,594 --> 00:59:45,998
Running away, eh?! You're a nut...
And so is your whole family!

724
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:48,258
You're going to die, too,
you rascal!

725
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:54,973

 can't say why, but 
 always feel
as if I've heard her voice earlier.

726
00:59:55,408 --> 01:00:00,539
This woman and her husband have paid
a price for living with dignity.

727
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,324
They're staring their construction
from today.

728
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:25,470
How about our business?!
What will happen to our shops...

729
01:00:25,672 --> 01:00:27,936
What business are you
talking about?

730
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,473
We keep our shops open for not more
than a week in a month, in any case.

731
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:35,272
- So? There was atleast something...
- When will the buildings come up?

732
01:00:35,482 --> 01:00:39,578
This builder has a great reputation;
his buildings come up overnight!

733
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,116
- What?!
- 
 heard that being said...

734
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:46,724
He's going to die!
The scoundrel's going to die!

735
01:00:46,927 --> 01:00:48,417
He's even digging a grave
for himself!

736
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:50,687
- Sawant! Take her away...
- You'll die a miserable death!

737
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:53,459
Curse be on you, you swine!

738
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,761
- You'll die... you surely will!
- Take her away!

739
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,972
You'll die thirsting for water!
Your sins will run their course!

740
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:03,809
There won't be a soul to sympathize
with your clan, you scum!

741
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,567
You have killed my husband...

742
01:01:05,779 --> 01:01:07,042
-..and 
 will kill you?

743
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,476
I will kill you!

744
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:17,786
There! The pitcher's broken
even before your funeral...

745
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,450
...l mean, even before you
can complete the ceremony!

746
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:31,569
You're going to die!
You will be wiped out!

747
01:01:34,174 --> 01:01:39,476
- Father!
- How long have you taken to come!

748
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,649
I can't help it. 
 have to change
three buses to get here.

749
01:01:42,983 --> 01:01:47,079
The nurse said that we'd
have to leave the hospital.

750
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:49,355
- Why is that?
- How would 
 know?!

751
01:01:49,656 --> 01:01:52,785
- Go and ask the doctor...
- Very well.

752
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:56,290
And tell him that my problem
is getting worse.

753
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,722
How are we going to manage?
Go and talk to him...

754
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:02,798
- Go on, will you??
- I'm off, Dad... here 
 go.

755
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,109
Have you asked my father
to go home, doctor?

756
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:14,613
That's right, Kashi.

757
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:18,508
Your father is now in the
last stages of cancer.

758
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:30,060
I'm sorry, but it's too late...
Nothing can be done about it.

759
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,464
Can't we do anything about it?

760
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,632
With such a renowned hospital
and its qualified doctors...

761
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,606
Please take another look at him...

762
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:45,702
We have come to you
with great hopes.

763
01:02:46,613 --> 01:02:51,244
You don't have to worry
about the costs, doctor.

764
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:53,378
We'd even sell everything we own!

765
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,054
But save my father...
Please!

766
01:02:58,825 --> 01:02:59,951
Please save my father

767
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,827
Your father has just
another month or two.

768
01:03:09,502 --> 01:03:12,631
Which is why 
 felt that he must
spend the rest of his days...

769
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,269
-...with his family.

770
01:03:16,142 --> 01:03:17,303
Take him home.

771
01:03:19,446 --> 01:03:21,881
You will have to be brave, Kashi.

772
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:26,010
Who'd look after him, if you
were to break up like this?

773
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:28,951
Get a hold on yourself.

774
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:17,996
What did the doctor say?

775
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:23,204
The doctor says that you'll recover
with the medicines at home.

776
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:26,575
He says there's no need for you
to stay here anymore.

777
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:31,175
But didn't you tell him that
the pain is getting worse?

778
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:35,782
He's prescribed a medicine for that;
that will help you recover.

779
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:45,457
If 
 stay here, I'd have the nurses
and doctors should 
 need something.

780
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:54,900
You'd recover faster at home,
with your own people around.

781
01:04:56,176 --> 01:04:59,111
That is right, too.

782
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:05,717
Very well then... we'll return
to Benaras in that case.

783
01:05:07,854 --> 01:05:11,722
Let's take Shiv and
his wife along, too.

784
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:16,954
The kid's thread-ceremony
is yet to be performed...

785
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:25,730
Besides, that road we're laying
to the temple in Benaras...

786
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,270
...I've also got to obtain
a sanction for that.

787
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:30,667
I've got to have the
school inaugurated.

788
01:05:31,044 --> 01:05:37,006
I can accomplish all this in a
matter of a few months in Benaras.

789
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,006
My son...

790
01:06:05,145 --> 01:06:07,876
Listen, son...

791
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:13,919
...death is a reality,
just as life is.

792
01:06:14,954 --> 01:06:17,389
One has to accept it.

793
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:21,020
Be brave, my son...

794
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:25,355
I have already lived my life...

795
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:31,598
...and want to spend the rest of
my days with dignity.

796
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,969
That's all 
 ask
God to grant me.

797
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:40,737
You mustn't let this shake you...
You're my brave boy, aren't you?

798
01:06:41,514 --> 01:06:43,846
Let's go... Come on.

799
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:48,681
Don't, my son... Stop crying...!

800
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:53,189
Let's go... Come on, my son.

801
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,790
Let's go... Get up.
Come on...

802
01:06:56,996 --> 01:06:58,794
And look; don't tell anyone
at home about this, okay?

803
01:06:59,065 --> 01:07:00,692
They'll be terribly worried.

804
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:04,335
Let's not tell anyone, okay?
Let's leave then... Come on.

805
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:07,465
Stand up... let's take our
things and leave...

806
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:11,072
Get up,... Come on.

807
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:35,265
You dare insult Katiya, eh!

808
01:07:46,946 --> 01:07:50,075
That man... that rascal
is hitting me!

809
01:07:50,383 --> 01:07:51,441
He's hitting me!

810
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,517
Listen, fellow...
Just get lost! Scram!

811
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:09,096
No! 
 don't want anyone
of you to interfere!

812
01:08:15,241 --> 01:08:18,370
Let's get away, Kashi... that's
Katya's thug; a vicious character.

813
01:09:11,531 --> 01:09:12,498
Get him!

814
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:58,961
They're all dead...
And you will also not escape!

815
01:11:06,245 --> 01:11:07,337
You're being funny, brother!

816
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,639
Our guys get beaten up
and you laugh at it!

817
01:11:10,116 --> 01:11:11,515
What else can 
 do, but laugh?

818
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:12,876
Just imagine...

819
01:11:13,152 --> 01:11:17,589
...one man, all alone, beats up
10 of my boys in the marketplace.

820
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,188
- What a sight it must've been!
- Must've been a terrific sight!

821
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,426
I wish we could all see it, too.

822
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:25,494
Shut up! The day 
 strip you
in the marketplace...

823
01:11:25,631 --> 01:11:27,998
..-.everyone will have
a sight to behold!

824
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,195
Let me have some chicken...
the leg-portion.

825
01:11:33,673 --> 01:11:36,267
So, tell me now... what am

 supposed to do with you?

826
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,306
Just give me one more
opportunity, Sir...

827
01:11:38,578 --> 01:11:40,103

 could even give up
my life for you.

828
01:11:40,413 --> 01:11:42,211
He'd even give up his
life for me, he says.

829
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:44,109
Very well then...
I'll take your life.

830
01:11:45,685 --> 01:11:47,710
Throw him the lion's cage.

831
01:11:48,488 --> 01:11:51,583
Kashi...! Come on! Hurry up!
Let's go... leave that alone!

832
01:11:51,824 --> 01:11:53,690
- Let's go! Hurry!
- What's wrong?

833
01:11:54,093 --> 01:11:56,061
Have you had a fight with someone?

834
01:11:56,262 --> 01:11:58,924
- Wear this! Quick!
- But what's up?

835
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,701
I'll tell you later... Just don't
open the door for anyone.

836
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:04,469
What's going on, Shiva...
Where are you taking Kashi to...

837
01:12:12,278 --> 01:12:16,044
The chaps you've beaten up
belong to Katya's mob!

838
01:12:16,349 --> 01:12:18,317
He hacks people to pieces in
a crowded marketplace!

839
01:12:18,651 --> 01:12:21,052
- This is not your home-town.
- 
 know that!

840
01:12:21,287 --> 01:12:22,777
This is a city of eunuchs!

841
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:25,285
They beat up a woman and humiliate
her in broad-daylight...

842
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:27,858
..-and all you do is to
watch the fun!

843
01:12:28,127 --> 01:12:30,357
Anyone who helps her is a fool!
An asst

844
01:12:30,563 --> 01:12:32,691
And what have you achieved out
of it?! What's the big deal?!

845
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:35,798
You've saved her today... alright.

846
01:12:36,068 --> 01:12:38,230
But what happens when they
beat her up again?

847
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,872
I'll give him a thrashing again!
I'll beat them up all over again!

848
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:43,405
If something like this happens in my
presence, I'll beat them up again!

849
01:12:43,643 --> 01:12:45,805

 just can't bear to
watch it silently!

850
01:12:47,213 --> 01:12:50,080
If someone were to misbehave
with your wife in public...

851
01:12:50,216 --> 01:12:52,150
...would you still be
giving me the same advise?

852
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,123
What's all this?!
Who are you?!

853
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,863
- Where's he?! Where's Kashi?
- He's not around.

854
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:11,070
Flexing your muscles, eh?
Encouraging thugs, are you?

855
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,773
- Where's Kashi? We want him!
- But what has he done?

856
01:13:14,006 --> 01:13:15,872
Shut up... or you'll be
cut to pieces!

857
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:21,806
If you want the kid back, bring
Kashi to us and take the kid away.

858
01:13:22,114 --> 01:13:24,242
Or we'll make mincemeat
out of the kid!

859
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,216
My son... !

860
01:13:29,055 --> 01:13:30,386
Oh, get lost!

861
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,659
What can they do at most?
Kill me, isn't it?

862
01:13:33,893 --> 01:13:35,793
I'd even die, but I'd never
leave father alone!

863
01:13:36,062 --> 01:13:40,295
You don't know about this, brother.
But the doctor says father is...

864
01:13:40,566 --> 01:13:42,364
Are you his own flesh
and blood then?

865
01:13:42,602 --> 01:13:44,536
I'm his own son!

866
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:47,163

 care for him, too!

867
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:52,734
Try to understand this, Kashi!

868
01:13:53,145 --> 01:13:54,909
Your presence here will
endanger our lives, too!

869
01:13:55,214 --> 01:13:57,979
They are capable of doing anything!
And just don't worry about Dad...

870
01:13:58,217 --> 01:14:00,276
I'll take care of him!
Here's what you must do...

871
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:04,352
Keep this money. There's a train
leaving from here at dawn tomorrow.

872
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,922
Take the train; it's not safe
for you to stay here anymore!

873
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:08,421

 must leave now.

874
01:14:13,499 --> 01:14:15,399
Even after knowing that
Kashi's life is in danger...

875
01:14:15,635 --> 01:14:17,933
...you still left him there,
all alone?!

876
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:19,535
That too, in a city where
he knows no one?!

877
01:14:19,839 --> 01:14:23,332
Had you gone mad?
You bloody coward!

878
01:14:27,446 --> 01:14:29,073
So what if he's not
your own brother...

879
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,872
...he means much more than
what brothers really are!

880
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:33,278
He'd give his life for you!

881
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,111
He's turned out to be a
better person than you are!

882
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,859
When you left for the city to
achieve something in life...

883
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:42,153
...he was the one who cared
for me in the village.

884
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:45,930
He did everything
a son should do!

885
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:51,395
Kashi has a heart of gold...
My son, Kashi, is a real gem!

886
01:14:52,038 --> 01:14:55,440
I will not stay here anymore.

887
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,237
I will return to my son.

888
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:01,312
I'll even breathe my last there.

889
01:15:02,682 --> 01:15:06,118
And 
 don't need people to carry
my bier to the cremation ground!

890
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:08,620
Kashi alone is enough
to do that for me!

891
01:15:10,823 --> 01:15:13,315
For how long will you sit there
like a bloody statue?

892
01:15:13,659 --> 01:15:15,354
Who will bring back your son?

893
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:18,694
They've said that they want Kashi
in return for your son.

894
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:23,626
And since Kashi is not here now,
how will your son return?

895
01:15:24,003 --> 01:15:27,371
What will you do, if something
happens to your son?!

896
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:33,408
O Lord! You've always
been merciful towards us...

897
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:40,812
- Where can 
 find Katiya?
- Why d'you want Katiya at this hour?

898
01:15:41,053 --> 01:15:42,612
I want him...
Let's go and find him!

899
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:44,916
- But what's happened?
- They've taken my nephew away!

900
01:15:45,157 --> 01:15:47,626
They want me... they'll get me!
Let's go and find Katiya.

901
01:15:47,893 --> 01:15:50,055
- But Katiya...
- I'll tear the scoundrel apart...

902
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:52,994
-..if my nephew suffers
as much as a scratch!

903
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:56,291
Relax, Kashi... the kid will
be okay; God will protect him.

904
01:15:56,502 --> 01:15:58,903
Besides, you just can't walk in
on Katiya like this.

905
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,731
It's difficult to tell the
movements of even his brothers.

906
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,566
But you can meet his
brother Antya tomorrow.

907
01:16:03,909 --> 01:16:06,173
He visits the Citylight Club every
evening to collect the spoils.

908
01:16:11,016 --> 01:16:12,609
This is where you will
find him, Kashi.

909
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:16,314
- I'll find Antya here, won't 1?
- of course; he comes here everyday.

910
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:18,079
Two tickets, please.

911
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:27,530
Don't let the joint mislead you.

912
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,232
It isn't what it appears to be.

913
01:16:30,603 --> 01:16:32,697
Let's go inside... the
real fun lies there.

914
01:21:45,918 --> 01:21:47,852
Leave me alone, Chandru...
Else, he'll go away!

915
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,348
Easy come, easy go, baby...
Nothing comes out of it!

916
01:21:55,928 --> 01:21:58,260
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

917
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:03,434
Do you know that girl?

918
01:22:05,104 --> 01:22:07,095
- That isn't the same Gauri
- No.

919
01:22:10,943 --> 01:22:12,104
Here you are, Sir...
Today's collection.

920
01:22:12,244 --> 01:22:13,837
So little?

921
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,413
Have you been stealing the dough
or are the collections really low?

922
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:20,246
Anyway... go and deal with Gauri.
And you keep the money.

923
01:22:20,552 --> 01:22:23,180
How will we manage if you
continue like this, Gauri?

924
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:25,115
The bosses at the Club
will throw us out...

925
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:29,987
-..-and without the money, how will

 be able to treat your sister?

926
01:22:30,496 --> 01:22:31,622
What'll 
 do? Nothing...

927
01:22:32,931 --> 01:22:35,423
And there are so many more tests
that have to be carried out.

928
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:37,826
Tell me now, whether this
is true or not...

929
01:22:38,237 --> 01:22:41,172
A lame-horse is always
shot dead, isn't it?

930
01:22:42,107 --> 01:22:45,372
What do we do with the humans?
Nothing?

931
01:22:47,312 --> 01:22:49,838
Aren't you ashamed to speak
like this about your wife?

932
01:22:50,182 --> 01:22:52,310
Not at all.

933
01:22:56,121 --> 01:22:57,680
Okay. You'll get the kid.

934
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:02,985
But you'd have to fight
Akram Khan Paghtuni for that.

935
01:23:10,035 --> 01:23:12,697
To get my nephew back,
I'd fight anyone.

936
01:23:27,286 --> 01:23:28,754
Uncle! Uncle!

937
01:23:44,503 --> 01:23:46,335
That's a terrible character!

938
01:23:46,572 --> 01:23:49,337
He kills a man and then
plucks his heart out!

939
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:51,474
That's what they say about him.

940
01:23:51,977 --> 01:23:55,845
He'd need a real heart
to pluck out mine.

941
01:26:39,644 --> 01:26:41,806
- My son!
- Uncle!

942
01:27:04,503 --> 01:27:06,198
It's good that you've stopped him.

943
01:27:06,438 --> 01:27:08,668
Or you'd have been six brothers
instead of seven!

944
01:27:10,108 --> 01:27:14,511
I'm happy to have witnessed
your acts of bravery.

945
01:27:15,247 --> 01:27:17,409
You will also be happy to know...

946
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:22,086
...that you shall henceforth
work for my gang.

947
01:27:22,587 --> 01:27:24,112
This is a laborer's hand, Katiya...

948
01:27:24,589 --> 01:27:27,718
...which can even mould raw iron.

949
01:27:28,593 --> 01:27:32,052
This is strength I've earned from
money earned with toil and sweat.

950
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:35,792

 don't need to live on the
crumbs somebody throws to me.

951
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:38,260
Rather than live the life of
scum in the filthy streets...

952
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:42,634
...you should rather live among
real men; like a tiger.

953
01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:45,771
Even a caged-tiger is nothing
more than a mere dog, Katiya!

954
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:48,810
You want me to be a mere dog
at your feet, do you?

955
01:27:49,414 --> 01:27:51,746
A dog which barks and
bites at your will?!

956
01:27:51,883 --> 01:27:56,343
You could say that...
So what's wrong?

957
01:27:57,556 --> 01:28:00,048
Should you work for me,
you'll soon be famous.

958
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:02,591
You'll receive handsome rewards.

959
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:04,526
Besides earning a lot of money...

960
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,157
...you'll be a
widely respected man...

961
01:28:07,632 --> 01:28:09,225
...and people will
be terrified of you.

962
01:28:09,668 --> 01:28:12,865
Only cowards, who have water flowing
in their veins, terrorize people!

963
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:15,674
If you're really fond of
flaunting your manliness...

964
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:18,669
...stop depending
on your dogs, Katiya!

965
01:28:40,632 --> 01:28:42,464
He walks into our den
and humiliates us!

966
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:46,163
That's enough!

967
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:58,880
I'll now have to plan
a death for him.

968
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,768
- Yes, sister?
- What's wrong?

969
01:29:17,168 --> 01:29:18,966
You seem to be lost in
your thoughts these days.

970
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:21,906
What's up? Had a tiff
with Kashi, did you?

971
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:24,608
Not at all. There's nothing
of the sort, sister.

972
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,602
Didn't you tell me that
Kashi's going to visit us?

973
01:29:28,046 --> 01:29:29,844
When is he coming over?

974
01:29:32,484 --> 01:29:36,421
He'll never come here
now, sister... Never.

975
01:29:36,855 --> 01:29:38,016
But why?

976
01:29:38,523 --> 01:29:42,756
- He saw me at the club.
- So?

977
01:29:43,161 --> 01:29:49,430

 hadn't told him that

 dance at the club...

978
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,867
And why didn't you tell him?

979
01:29:53,705 --> 01:29:56,800
You should've told him...

980
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:58,874
...that it's not
out of your will...

981
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,943
...but to save your sister
that you dance at the club!

982
01:30:03,748 --> 01:30:05,978

 knew something of the sort
would happen one day.

983
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,313
And you...! Hadn't 
 already
warned you?

984
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:12,991
Why are you spoiling your life
for my sake?

985
01:30:14,793 --> 01:30:17,421
I wish I'd die...

986
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:18,960
Don't say that, sister...

987
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,367
It's still not late...

988
01:30:25,804 --> 01:30:28,739
Tell Kashi the truth...
I'm sure he'd understand.

989
01:30:29,741 --> 01:30:32,733
I'm sure he'd never desert you.

990
01:30:41,152 --> 01:30:42,517
Please hear me out, Kashi...

991
01:30:43,421 --> 01:30:46,186
What else can 
 now listen to?
Haven't 
 already seen enough?

992
01:30:46,725 --> 01:30:48,659
Try and con the Almighty now...

993
01:30:49,227 --> 01:30:51,195
He's innocent;
He'll believe your tale.

994
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:53,127
But it is you 
 want to
explain the truth to!

995
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:07,206
We had to go through all this
because of Chandru.

996
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:11,277

 wanted to tell you everything
on several occasions...

997
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:18,448
But for fear of losing you,

 just couldn't...

998
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:24,392
I'll leave now, Kashi.

999
01:31:33,371 --> 01:31:35,703
I'm taking my father back
to Benaras tomorrow.

1000
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,865
The doctor has given up hopes.

1001
01:31:40,378 --> 01:31:45,509
He wants my father to spend
the rest of his days in peace.

1002
01:31:47,352 --> 01:31:49,582
But 
 will return
to take you away.

1003
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:54,057
You will accompany me
to Benaras, won't you?

1004
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:13,769
I'd have been happy, had
you too accompanied us, Shiv.

1005
01:32:14,679 --> 01:32:17,410
This thing about the land
is yet to be sorted out.

1006
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:20,915
Besides, my son has his school too.

 can't come over just yet.

1007
01:32:21,386 --> 01:32:24,287
Well then, brother... Forgive me
for any mistake 
 must've made.

1008
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,518
Why must you say that?!

1009
01:32:26,825 --> 01:32:31,661
You'll see that I'll call you back
the moment this thing is sorted out.

1010
01:32:31,996 --> 01:32:36,160
And you... why did you have to
take Katiya on again?

1011
01:32:36,534 --> 01:32:39,094
- Couldn't you keep quiet?
- And do what? Be a slave to him?

1012
01:32:39,504 --> 01:32:42,064
- Lick his feet?!
- There you go again...

1013
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:43,832
I hate this habit of yours!

1014
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:46,539
Just forget the past.

1015
01:32:47,112 --> 01:32:49,581
You must never fight when
you set out on a journey.

1016
01:32:49,914 --> 01:32:53,748
Take good care of your
wife and your son, okay?

1017
01:32:55,186 --> 01:32:59,248
You'll come to me at Benaras,
won't you Munna?

1018
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:01,088
Bless you.

1019
01:33:03,628 --> 01:33:04,993
What are you guys up to?!

1020
01:33:05,196 --> 01:33:09,690
Let him go! Leave him alone!
What has he done, after all?!

1021
01:33:10,135 --> 01:33:12,160
Leave him alone!

1022
01:33:12,904 --> 01:33:14,804
Listen! Please listen to me!

1023
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:16,939
Listen! Please!

1024
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:54,672
The window! Use the window!
Hurry up!

1025
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,881
Let him go!

1026
01:34:00,185 --> 01:34:02,176
Someone save my brother,...!

1027
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:12,856
Help! Don't hit him!

1028
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:15,897
Let him go! Please don't hit him!

1029
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:53,304
Please save Kashi?!

1030
01:34:57,041 --> 01:35:00,067
Let Kashi go, Katiya...
Please spare him!

1031
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:07,214
Please don't hit him!
Please let my son go!

1032
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,556
<i>No...! Please don't!</i>

1033
01:35:24,235 --> 01:35:27,762
Please set my son free!

1034
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:55,132
Your father's a bloody dog!

1035
01:36:13,217 --> 01:36:14,378
Do you see that, Kashinath?!?

1036
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:20,017
You had claimed that you didn't
want to be a dog at my feet.

1037
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:21,586
But look at this...

1038
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:26,156
...your father is wagging his
tail before me, as a dog would!

1039
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:28,558
He's even licking my boots!

1040
01:36:30,301 --> 01:36:33,066
And a dog's offspring can only
be a dog; never a lion!

1041
01:36:34,072 --> 01:36:37,406
Your father's a dog;
and you're a son-of-bitch!

1042
01:36:37,842 --> 01:36:39,936
You're a dog, no less!

1043
01:36:46,284 --> 01:36:48,719

 could have killed you the
other day, if 
 so wished.

1044
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:52,221
But granting you death then...

1045
01:36:52,490 --> 01:36:54,254
...would have been a reward
for your bravery...

1046
01:36:54,592 --> 01:36:55,855
-...and not a punishment!

1047
01:36:56,127 --> 01:36:57,686
This... this is your punishment!

1048
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:00,864
Just look at his state...
this is what your punishment is!

1049
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:06,094
You will curse yourself every time
you take a breath, hereafter!

1050
01:37:06,371 --> 01:37:10,638
Your life will seem to be a burden
and you will long for death!

1051
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:16,013
When you've had enough,
come to my doorstep...

1052
01:37:16,814 --> 01:37:20,273
Should 
 feel charitable then,
I'll grant you death, too!

1053
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:32,522
Go on, you filthy dog...
Go to your puppy!

1054
01:37:42,907 --> 01:37:46,366
- Father...
- My son!

1055
01:37:47,678 --> 01:37:48,770
Father?

1056
01:38:23,347 --> 01:38:25,406
How's your father now?

1057
01:38:29,287 --> 01:38:32,120
- Look, Kashi...
- What's going on over here?!

1058
01:38:33,424 --> 01:38:36,189
What are you both doing here,
so late in the night?

1059
01:38:36,727 --> 01:38:38,559
Nothing; we were only sitting here.
Let's go, Kashi

1060
01:38:38,729 --> 01:38:42,097
How can you do this?
Don't you respect the law?

1061
01:38:42,533 --> 01:38:43,898
We stay in the neighborhood
and so...

1062
01:38:44,135 --> 01:38:46,263
This girl? She's the one who
dances in the seedy joint.

1063
01:38:46,537 --> 01:38:48,335
Dances, eh? Lock her up then...

1064
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:56,912
Don't! Please, don't!

1065
01:38:57,315 --> 01:38:59,010
Please don't hit me!

1066
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:09,823
Stop it, Kashi...T Let him go!

1067
01:39:10,094 --> 01:39:13,029
Leave him alone, Kashi! Please!

1068
01:39:13,598 --> 01:39:16,226
And what will these guys do?
Kill me, eh?!

1069
01:39:16,667 --> 01:39:18,226
They can only hang me, isn't it?

1070
01:39:18,536 --> 01:39:21,528
I'm rather die...but 
 can't
live the life of a coward!

1071
01:39:21,939 --> 01:39:23,168

 can't be impotent!

1072
01:39:23,441 --> 01:39:26,001
How can 
 tolerate anyone
touching you in my presence?

1073
01:39:26,277 --> 01:39:27,642
I'd hack them to pieces!

1074
01:39:28,446 --> 01:39:31,882
Where were they, when those swines
made a dog out of my father?!

1075
01:39:32,183 --> 01:39:34,208
Is it a sin to wish to live
with honor and dignity?

1076
01:39:34,452 --> 01:39:37,183
All we want is to lead
a life of respect!

1077
01:39:40,725 --> 01:39:44,992
We had only come here to
have my father treated.

1078
01:39:45,363 --> 01:39:48,128
And they made a dog out of him!

1079
01:39:48,633 --> 01:39:52,570
They revere him, back there
in Benaras; they salute him!

1080
01:39:53,004 --> 01:39:54,267
And what happens here?

1081
01:39:54,805 --> 01:39:56,432
Out here,...

1082
01:40:03,881 --> 01:40:08,318
No, Kashi... Don't cry.

1083
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:34,544
He's a very nice man, Inspector...
Please let him go.

1084
01:40:35,346 --> 01:40:37,576
Let him go is not the problem.

1085
01:40:38,416 --> 01:40:41,647
The problem is that when
you're in love with him...

1086
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:43,944
...why didn't you drill
some sense into him?

1087
01:40:44,322 --> 01:40:47,781
Why did he have to
mess with Katiya at all?

1088
01:40:48,259 --> 01:40:51,024
This is what he gets out of
messing with Katiya, right?

1089
01:40:51,429 --> 01:40:55,889
Had he worked for Katiya, he could
have quietly enjoyed himself.

1090
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,765
Quietly? Like you, isn't it?

1091
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:02,366
Shedding all his shame
in the process, right?

1092
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:07,301
Great! You dance in a seedy joint...
and talk of respect?!

1093
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:13,841
Of course 
 dance... that too,
in a club.

1094
01:41:14,552 --> 01:41:16,782
I earn my money with
sheer hard work...

1095
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:19,012
...and don't earn my livelihood
from sin, like you do!

1096
01:41:20,091 --> 01:41:23,959
You earn your bread and butter
from the Government...

1097
01:41:24,295 --> 01:41:26,662
...but you're a slave to Katiya!

1098
01:41:28,699 --> 01:41:29,860
Just you wait...!

1099
01:41:31,769 --> 01:41:33,669
Now where is my register?

1100
01:41:34,538 --> 01:41:36,836
Once 
 file charges against him,
he'll be thrown in for 7 years!

1101
01:41:37,475 --> 01:41:41,173
Very well then... go ahead
and file the charges!

1102
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,410
Just you open that register
and start writing. Go on!

1103
01:41:44,749 --> 01:41:48,083
The constables attached to
your station, held my held!

1104
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:51,152
Your constables got drunk
and misbehaved with me!?

1105
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:55,322
They not only grabbed my hand...
they even tore my clothes! Look!

1106
01:41:55,793 --> 01:41:57,488
They even ripped
open my clothes!

1107
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:01,923
Write that! Open your register
and record my statement!

1108
01:42:02,233 --> 01:42:04,361
You will record it...
You certainly will!

1109
01:42:04,802 --> 01:42:07,669
I'll assemble some women here
who will stand witness!

1110
01:42:08,172 --> 01:42:11,836
File the charges...! Go on!
What are you staring at me for?!

1111
01:42:14,178 --> 01:42:16,704
There's no problem there...
I'm the one with problems.

1112
01:42:17,615 --> 01:42:19,310
Hey... let him go.

1113
01:42:23,487 --> 01:42:27,082
We've even tamed that muscleman
you got from Benaras.

1114
01:42:27,725 --> 01:42:31,889
We publicly made a dog out
of this chap's father!

1115
01:42:32,797 --> 01:42:35,960
In spite of all this, your shops are
still open and business goes on!

1116
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:41,467
- But the Courts...
- What Katiya says is the law!

1117
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,334
My brother had his special man's
finger cut, all because of you.

1118
01:42:45,776 --> 01:42:47,141
Could you still dare do this?

1119
01:42:47,478 --> 01:42:49,913
It's not a question of daring;
it's our necessity...

1120
01:42:50,181 --> 01:42:51,376
Cut the dialogue!

1121
01:42:52,883 --> 01:42:55,818
- Tell us your name.
- Ambikaprasad Satyanarayan Tiwari.

1122
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,986
- How much does your shop measure?
-It's 10 feet by 12.

1123
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:00,781
- Pay him 50,000.
- But it has stuff worth 1,50,000!

1124
01:43:01,158 --> 01:43:02,489
It's 40,000 then.

1125
01:43:04,261 --> 01:43:10,200
Quietly take whatever Katiya is
giving you and just get lost!

1126
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:16,638
Don't worry, boss...
I'm keeping a watch on them.

1127
01:43:17,174 --> 01:43:19,836
Anyone who opens the shutters
of his shop...

1128
01:43:20,077 --> 01:43:22,739
...will have to lose his life!

1129
01:43:47,271 --> 01:43:49,501
You don't wish to be
a dog at my feet!

1130
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:52,773
But look; your father is
very much a dog for me!

1131
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:55,674
He's even licking my boots!

1132
01:43:56,013 --> 01:43:58,744
Your father is a dog for me!

1133
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:03,386
Your father's a dog for me!
He's licking my feet!

1134
01:44:03,687 --> 01:44:09,126
Your father's wagging his tail
before me! He's licking my feet!

1135
01:44:24,809 --> 01:44:28,473
Learn to contain your
temper, my son.

1136
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:35,443
You came to see whether

 was still alive, right?

1137
01:44:36,987 --> 01:44:38,580
So that, after I'm dead...

1138
01:44:38,823 --> 01:44:40,848
...you can finish Katiya
and go to prison.

1139
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,021
But you must learn to
nurture your temper.

1140
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:49,630
When Gandhi was thrown out of
a train in South Africa...

1141
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,801
-.-he didn't waste his fury
on the Ticket Collector.

1142
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:58,107
In fact, he preserved
all his rage...

1143
01:45:00,311 --> 01:45:02,973
...and turned into the foundation
of his struggle for India's freedom.

1144
01:45:03,848 --> 01:45:05,577
He eventually won Independence
for his nation.

1145
01:45:08,919 --> 01:45:11,081
That is exactly what you
will have to do, Kashi.

1146
01:45:13,757 --> 01:45:16,488
Killing Katiya is not the
solution to our problems.

1147
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:19,222
Because Katiya is not
our enemy.

1148
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:22,662
It is actually the terror he
strikes in people's hearts...

1149
01:45:23,267 --> 01:45:26,362
...which is even more lethal than
the cancer that has struck me.

1150
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:29,969
It is fear that has
stifled all voices.

1151
01:45:30,508 --> 01:45:32,442
It's rendered them hollow!

1152
01:45:33,344 --> 01:45:37,508
You will have to instill
confidence in the people...

1153
01:45:37,781 --> 01:45:40,910
...and make them so brave...

1154
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:44,144
...that even a child may take on
Katiya, when the need arises!

1155
01:45:44,488 --> 01:45:46,684
Katiya will die on his own...

1156
01:45:47,358 --> 01:45:51,158
...and we'll never have
another bully again.

1157
01:45:55,399 --> 01:45:59,199
Just learn to contain
your anger, my son...

1158
01:46:13,384 --> 01:46:14,510
What are you doing here
at this hour?

1159
01:46:15,419 --> 01:46:17,046
Are you drunk?

1160
01:46:18,155 --> 01:46:22,092
Lock the shutters.

1161
01:46:23,127 --> 01:46:26,893
- Have you had liquor, brother?
- Sure! I've had liquor indeed!

1162
01:46:27,498 --> 01:46:30,229
After ages, I've done something

 felt like doing

1163
01:46:30,668 --> 01:46:33,069
I've made up my mind, Kashi.

1164
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,837
I'll give up everything here
and return to Benaras.

1165
01:46:36,507 --> 01:46:41,673
Give up everything? This shop...
this land of yours? Everything?

1166
01:46:46,383 --> 01:46:49,216
Do you still think everything
here belongs to me?

1167
01:46:52,423 --> 01:46:57,589
It's gone... I've lost
everything, brother.

1168
01:46:58,429 --> 01:47:00,227
It's all over for me.

1169
01:47:01,465 --> 01:47:06,062
I'll now manage in the piece
of land 
 have in Benaras.

1170
01:47:06,403 --> 01:47:08,394
Land? You have no land there.

1171
01:47:09,206 --> 01:47:10,867
We have fields in
Benaras, don't we?

1172
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,233
A coward can't ever own
any land, brother.

1173
01:47:13,744 --> 01:47:15,735
What nonsense are you talking?

1174
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,139
You're running away from this
land because of Katiya today.

1175
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:21,246
There'll be another bully tomorrow.
How will you protect your land?

1176
01:47:21,452 --> 01:47:23,750
Stop lecturing me!
You're preaching to me, eh?!

1177
01:47:24,054 --> 01:47:27,319
I've personally seen terror
in that square there!

1178
01:47:27,758 --> 01:47:29,419

 have even borne it!

1179
01:47:29,793 --> 01:47:31,887
Okay... 
 can't indulge
in hooliganism like you do!

1180
01:47:32,262 --> 01:47:34,094
Fighting for one's rights
is not hooliganism!

1181
01:47:34,298 --> 01:47:37,029
Rights, my foot! Which rights
are you talking about?!

1182
01:47:37,334 --> 01:47:41,168
Even our documents have
begun to gather dust!

1183
01:47:41,438 --> 01:47:42,769
It's sheer nonsense!

1184
01:47:43,073 --> 01:47:45,599
All that talk about rights and
justice is nothing but nonsense!

1185
01:47:46,176 --> 01:47:49,237
There's only one law that prevails
out here... might is right!

1186
01:47:49,413 --> 01:47:52,747
That's it! "Might is Right"!

1187
01:47:55,419 --> 01:47:58,047
You're lucky that Katiya should
have had his eye on your shop.

1188
01:47:58,689 --> 01:48:01,681
Had he eyed your wife,
you'd have deserted her, too.

1189
01:48:03,127 --> 01:48:04,822
Aren't you ashamed to
talk like that?

1190
01:48:05,295 --> 01:48:08,230
She's my wife...!
The honor of our home...

1191
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:10,966
- She's your sister-in-law!
- And this land is our Mother?

1192
01:48:11,635 --> 01:48:15,265
Will you abandon the land that
gave you your bread and better?

1193
01:48:16,273 --> 01:48:18,469
The land, because of which
you got married...

1194
01:48:18,676 --> 01:48:20,201
...and which helped you
bring up your son...

1195
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:22,175
...could you ever desert
such a piece of land?!

1196
01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:25,712
It's not a piece of mere land...
It's your honor itself!

1197
01:48:26,617 --> 01:48:28,483
It's your self-respect, brother!

1198
01:48:28,686 --> 01:48:30,814
And there's nothing more precious

1199
01:48:31,221 --> 01:48:32,814
Nothing!

1200
01:48:50,841 --> 01:48:52,104
I've made a vow.

1201
01:48:52,342 --> 01:48:54,470
I'll die, but 
 won't leave my shop!

1202
01:48:54,678 --> 01:48:56,203
But no one has taken your shop.

1203
01:48:56,413 --> 01:48:59,542
If you open your shop, all the...
other shops will be in trouble!

1204
01:48:59,717 --> 01:49:02,277
Hey!...Who's opening their shop?

1205
01:49:02,553 --> 01:49:03,782
His shop.

1206
01:49:03,921 --> 01:49:05,286
-Yes it's me who opened...
-What will you do about it?

1207
01:49:05,389 --> 01:49:07,380
-Come in the middle.
-Start counting.

1208
01:49:07,991 --> 01:49:12,360
One...two....three...four?!

1209
01:49:30,881 --> 01:49:32,371
Today it will be you!

1210
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:34,079

 said no one will interfere!

1211
01:49:34,852 --> 01:49:36,581
Hit me....l said hit me.

1212
01:49:37,054 --> 01:49:38,681
I'll take a laddu.

1213
01:49:58,342 --> 01:50:00,538
-Hey he's about to come.
-Close the shop.

1214
01:50:00,778 --> 01:50:02,268
Nothing will happen.

1215
01:50:04,715 --> 01:50:07,446
-Where is he?....There he is!
-The rascal!

1216
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:08,742
He's come....seel

1217
01:50:19,763 --> 01:50:20,696
Seetl

1218
01:50:21,465 --> 01:50:22,990
You're for real!

1219
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:29,296
-Look Shiva..we understand.
-We understand everything.

1220
01:50:29,506 --> 01:50:31,270
But tell us one thing.

1221
01:50:31,508 --> 01:50:36,776
Us shopkeepers...will we run our...
business....or fight those thugs?

1222
01:50:36,947 --> 01:50:40,645
Do you have other strong people...
in Benares Kashish?

1223
01:50:41,018 --> 01:50:42,417
Bring 10-12 of them here.

1224
01:50:42,686 --> 01:50:44,154
We'll give them what they want.

1225
01:50:44,388 --> 01:50:46,413
Yes we'll give them a place to stay.

1226
01:50:46,824 --> 01:50:48,189
We'll raise them.

1227
01:50:48,492 --> 01:50:52,156
First you'll raise them...
Then when they become thugs?

1228
01:50:52,429 --> 01:50:53,453
You'll raise thugs!

1229
01:50:53,764 --> 01:50:55,357
We have to do what needs to be done!

1230
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:57,064
Nothing will go wrong for you.

1231
01:50:57,334 --> 01:50:58,893
Your brother is a strong man.

1232
01:50:59,169 --> 01:51:00,568

 don't even have a brother.

1233
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:02,929
Shiva...you fight.
Your shop will go.

1234
01:51:03,173 --> 01:51:05,164
Dama Kaka...for us its no go.

1235
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:07,840
Why won't you listen...
all of us will go together.

1236
01:51:08,312 --> 01:51:10,212
-Is the shop running?
-Their all closed!

1237
01:51:10,514 --> 01:51:12,346
We can't fight those thugs!

1238
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:14,551
-And the police won't listen to us!
-They will listen.

1239
01:51:16,854 --> 01:51:18,583
The police will listen to you.

1240
01:51:19,323 --> 01:51:20,688
They will have to listen.

1241
01:51:22,993 --> 01:51:24,552
What will he do now?

1242
01:51:25,462 --> 01:51:27,089
Yes I've sent the picture.

1243
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:29,024
Also have sent all the details.

1244
01:51:29,366 --> 01:51:31,960
Why won't you people understand...
she's my daughter!

1245
01:51:32,302 --> 01:51:35,499
She's missing since noon..
no news as of yet!

1246
01:51:35,906 --> 01:51:38,807
Barricade the city!

1247
01:51:39,243 --> 01:51:42,838
Put the whole police force on this...
if needed!

1248
01:51:43,146 --> 01:51:44,477
But 
 need my daughter back!

1249
01:51:45,148 --> 01:51:49,745
What?...forget the commissioner...
I'll even talk to the minister!

1250
01:51:51,321 --> 01:51:53,949
-What did they say?
-Keep calm.

1251
01:51:54,224 --> 01:51:55,851
Nothing will happen to her...nothing.

1252
01:51:56,827 --> 01:51:58,295
I'm really scared.

1253
01:51:59,529 --> 01:52:02,328
This is all your fault!

1254
01:52:02,733 --> 01:52:06,670
-If anything happens to my daughter...
-Nothing will happen to her!

1255
01:52:06,904 --> 01:52:08,167
She has died!

1256
01:52:09,306 --> 01:52:10,432
-She's been murdered.
-What?

1257
01:52:11,508 --> 01:52:15,775
The police does nothing without proof...

1258
01:52:16,346 --> 01:52:17,836
Here take this.

1259
01:52:33,163 --> 01:52:38,567
When did it happen? How did it happen?
Who did it?

1260
01:52:39,536 --> 01:52:40,935
Make an inquiry.

1261
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:44,338
-Have to make a case.
-We'll Inspector?

1262
01:52:45,442 --> 01:52:49,743
Who knows how many kids have...
died on the streets.

1263
01:52:50,447 --> 01:52:52,347
Who never had a case.

1264
01:52:53,083 --> 01:52:57,520
And the ones who had a case...
Their file never got opened.

1265
01:52:58,188 --> 01:53:01,419
You're kneeling after finding out..
your daughter's been murdered?

1266
01:53:01,959 --> 01:53:05,691
The person you have made angry...
is the one who killed her.

1267
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:08,354
-But why kill her?
-Why kill Pinky?

1268
01:53:09,099 --> 01:53:10,965
What did she ever do to anyone!

1269
01:53:12,002 --> 01:53:15,302
Why?..The hand was cut off...

1270
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:17,667
...from the person who only...
wanted his right...why?

1271
01:53:18,575 --> 01:53:24,309
His wife was killed at your police station...
She turned mad..then got no justice..why?

1272
01:53:25,315 --> 01:53:31,516
A person is treated like a dog..made to..
look like a fool...why?

1273
01:53:32,289 --> 01:53:37,489
People ask for their rights...
kneel before the authorities...

1274
01:53:37,861 --> 01:53:44,961
..-pay you bribes.._.they can't even eat..
why?_.why?

1275
01:53:45,669 --> 01:53:48,798
No telling how many people have suffered..
why?._._.why?

1276
01:53:54,044 --> 01:53:58,242
Why?...because the law and justice...
sit enslaved!

1277
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,646
And while all this happens...
this is the way it will be!

1278
01:54:04,087 --> 01:54:05,885
You are responsible for this murder.

1279
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:11,727
An office as yourself make life difficult...
for a man.

1280
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:15,958
Your daughter has paid for you're...
misdeeds.

1281
01:54:21,238 --> 01:54:24,230
Why didn't 
 die before seeing..
all this!

1282
01:54:26,143 --> 01:54:29,135
The death you want because of this...

1283
01:54:30,013 --> 01:54:33,108
this is how we live day to day.

1284
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,285
Pinky...take care of your father.

1285
01:54:50,567 --> 01:54:51,363
Wait Kashi.

1286
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:55,772
You did the right thing.

1287
01:54:56,206 --> 01:55:00,143
This was the way to convince me.

1288
01:55:01,378 --> 01:55:03,574
I'll fight with you.

1289
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:06,015
Whether 
 keep my job or not.

1290
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:08,976
-Whether 
 die or not...
-l promise you...

1291
01:55:09,186 --> 01:55:11,678
Katyia cannot remove you from the land.

1292
01:55:16,093 --> 01:55:18,494
Hey...look at him.

1293
01:55:19,396 --> 01:55:21,626
Greetings.

1294
01:55:23,533 --> 01:55:27,299
Inspector...as you know...
yes its Shiv Rath.

1295
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:33,474
Yes it is Shiv Rath...but we are...
going crazy because of the shops.

1296
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:35,742
This is all because of the Inspector.

1297
01:55:35,979 --> 01:55:38,539
It's not because of me...
but because of Bhole-Nath.

1298
01:55:38,815 --> 01:55:41,978
He has sent Kashi as our savior.

1299
01:55:42,252 --> 01:55:44,016
Sir, tomorrow we are starting our...
business.

1300
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:45,985
-It will be calm won't it?
-Of course it will.

1301
01:55:46,056 --> 01:55:48,081
Within 2-3 days a new police station...
will open here.

1302
01:55:48,325 --> 01:55:49,588
This is why I'm going to Delhi.

1303
01:55:49,826 --> 01:55:52,557
And 
 promise you, Katya and all...
his men will be arrested.

1304
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:54,689
Now you will have to take blessing's.

1305
01:55:54,898 --> 01:55:56,764
At night we have planned a religious...
function.

1306
01:55:57,167 --> 01:55:58,657

 want you to come for sure.

1307
01:55:58,835 --> 01:55:59,961
We will a lot of fun and play.

1308
01:56:00,303 --> 01:56:01,634
A religious function with fun and play?

1309
01:56:01,805 --> 01:56:03,534
Here take this.

1310
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:05,808
Here are some passes that were forgotten...
at the police station.

1311
01:56:06,076 --> 01:56:08,545
A new club is opening...Go there...
and have fun and frolic!

1312
01:56:09,713 --> 01:56:11,477
OK I'm going.

1313
01:56:12,816 --> 01:56:15,183
Goodbye.

1314
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:49,458
13
Iy

1315
02:02:27,023 --> 02:02:28,991
-Wow...That was fun.
-The dance was great!

1316
02:02:29,192 --> 02:02:30,182
Where did they go?

1317
02:02:30,426 --> 02:02:32,622
Hey Dhamoo-Kaka...come here!

1318
02:03:31,721 --> 02:03:34,850
Everything will be OK.

1319
02:03:36,259 --> 02:03:38,193
Be calm...all will be fine.

1320
02:03:55,845 --> 02:03:56,971
What happened is terrible.

1321
02:03:57,313 --> 02:04:00,715
Katya is very hurt because of this.

1322
02:04:01,217 --> 02:04:04,278
Because of this, he has come...
to meet you himself.

1323
02:04:10,593 --> 02:04:11,992
People will talk...

1324
02:04:13,763 --> 02:04:15,697
..-.that Katya has done this deed.

1325
02:04:17,967 --> 02:04:22,495
But everyone knows, that whatever...
Katya does...

1326
02:04:22,972 --> 02:04:25,441
...he does it openly.

1327
02:04:29,545 --> 02:04:30,740
He does in front of everyone.

1328
02:04:33,049 --> 02:04:34,483
And does in broad daylight.

1329
02:04:36,319 --> 02:04:38,253
This is a fatal incident...

1330
02:04:39,288 --> 02:04:41,848
Dead people will get RS.20,000...

1331
02:04:42,325 --> 02:04:45,522
..-and injured people...Rs 10,000.

1332
02:04:45,862 --> 02:04:47,455
I give right now.

1333
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:49,630
Not 2 years later as the government does.

1334
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,024
And another thing...

1335
02:04:52,802 --> 02:04:55,567
you never know when death may grip you.

1336
02:04:56,606 --> 02:04:58,165
This know one knows.

1337
02:04:58,975 --> 02:05:00,909
Those who are living...

1338
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:03,702
should remember this!

1339
02:05:04,647 --> 02:05:08,948
That this incident could happen to...
them as well.

1340
02:05:11,387 --> 02:05:12,047
Let's go.

1341
02:05:56,833 --> 02:05:57,732
Let me go!

1342
02:06:10,813 --> 02:06:12,804
-Let me go!
-Bastard!

1343
02:06:13,649 --> 02:06:15,276
You dare lay your hands on Katya!

1344
02:06:15,451 --> 02:06:18,045
Lay my hands?._.I'll pull your heart...
out you bastard!

1345
02:06:18,254 --> 02:06:19,949
You dare lay your hands on my brother!

1346
02:06:20,423 --> 02:06:21,652
I'll bash you over and over!

1347
02:06:21,924 --> 02:06:23,323
I'll bash you over and over!

1348
02:06:23,693 --> 02:06:25,627
I'll tear you apart you bastard!

1349
02:06:25,728 --> 02:06:27,492

 swear, by tomorrow sunrise...

1350
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:30,894
forget tomorrow...I'll burn now!

1351
02:06:31,067 --> 02:06:33,126
You'll burn me alive?

1352
02:06:33,369 --> 02:06:36,361
-Come on..Let's go...
-Let the bastard go!

1353
02:06:36,706 --> 02:06:39,903
If all 7 of you are of one father...

1354
02:06:40,143 --> 02:06:42,168

 swear upon the Ganges...

1355
02:06:42,378 --> 02:06:44,142
I will kill you in your own house!

1356
02:06:44,347 --> 02:06:47,044
I'll kill all 7 of you...all 71

1357
02:06:47,383 --> 02:06:50,182
-Stop!
-1 made your father a dog!

1358
02:06:50,386 --> 02:06:51,785
You also...

1359
02:07:37,834 --> 02:07:40,303
-Here...
-Wash your face brother in law.

1360
02:07:40,536 --> 02:07:42,630
The dirt will come off from...
this hot water.

1361
02:07:43,105 --> 02:07:44,766
But the disgrace that's on your face...

1362
02:07:45,241 --> 02:07:48,370
-The disgrace will be washed by blood!
-Kashi's blood!

1363
02:07:48,644 --> 02:07:50,169

 need his blood!....His blood!

1364
02:07:55,218 --> 02:07:57,653
No telling which mole Kashi...
is hiding in.

1365
02:07:58,221 --> 02:07:59,950
Looks like he ran back to Benares.

1366
02:08:00,556 --> 02:08:01,921
We'll look here.

1367
02:08:07,496 --> 02:08:08,554
What happened?

1368
02:08:08,965 --> 02:08:10,626
Who did all this?

1369
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:23,011
After 
 swore to kill all 7 of you...
together...

1370
02:08:23,512 --> 02:08:26,038
...all 7 of you started wandering...
separately.

1371
02:08:26,349 --> 02:08:27,475
Not wandering separately...

1372
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:30,617
..-but looking for you as your death!

1373
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:33,250
Death is awaiting you here.

1374
02:08:36,626 --> 02:08:39,755
Talk...want to die alone...
or with your brothers?

1375
02:08:40,229 --> 02:08:41,492
Tear him apart!

1376
02:10:17,827 --> 02:10:19,226
Why are you all ashamed?

1377
02:10:19,462 --> 02:10:20,452
Drink!

1378
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:22,022
This is Anthes party.

1379
02:10:22,398 --> 02:10:24,389
He loves throwing a party.

1380
02:10:24,834 --> 02:10:27,599
He loves wining and dining people.

1381
02:10:28,104 --> 02:10:29,162
Go ahead and drink.

1382
02:10:30,439 --> 02:10:32,806
If you won't drink...Anthe will._.
not like it.

1383
02:10:33,609 --> 02:10:34,508
Drink!

1384
02:10:34,777 --> 02:10:39,044
Hey Anthe, everyone is at your party...
but no one is wining and dining.

1385
02:10:39,415 --> 02:10:41,179
You tell them.

1386
02:10:41,717 --> 02:10:43,014
They will listen to you.

1387
02:10:43,652 --> 02:10:45,211
Just like you listen to me.

1388
02:10:49,458 --> 02:10:51,222
He's a good brother.

1389
02:10:51,827 --> 02:10:52,988
A very good brother.

1390
02:10:53,562 --> 02:10:54,859
He respects me very much.

1391
02:10:55,331 --> 02:10:56,355
Listens to me.

1392
02:10:56,732 --> 02:10:58,461
Does not do anything...

1393
02:10:58,734 --> 02:10:59,929
-...without asking me.

1394
02:11:00,202 --> 02:11:01,499
But today!

1395
02:11:01,804 --> 02:11:04,239
But today...he's died without...
asking me.

1396
02:11:06,242 --> 02:11:07,971
Died like a dog.

1397
02:11:08,277 --> 02:11:09,767
Now what do 
 do with you?

1398
02:11:16,852 --> 02:11:18,047
Burn!

1399
02:11:18,754 --> 02:11:21,314
-This is what was your fate!
-Burn!

1400
02:11:22,058 --> 02:11:25,255
Didn't you think of me before dying?

1401
02:11:26,695 --> 02:11:29,494
Didn't you think of how 
 would feel?

1402
02:11:30,633 --> 02:11:32,499
You should have asked me?

1403
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:34,864

 wouldn't have let you die!

1404
02:12:06,936 --> 02:12:08,870
Katya has said...

1405
02:12:09,271 --> 02:12:12,297
if anyone helps in lifting this...
dead body...

1406
02:12:12,608 --> 02:12:16,511
his whole family won't be spared.

1407
02:12:16,879 --> 02:12:19,314
Call the municipality to lift his body.

1408
02:13:14,770 --> 02:13:15,999
4 men please step forward...

1409
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:17,501
It's time to give shoulder to...
the body.

1410
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:27,240
Please 4 people step up, it's time...
to lift the body.

1411
02:13:38,928 --> 02:13:41,863
Panditji, according to the rituals...

1412
02:13:42,665 --> 02:13:44,394
four men are needed.

1413
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:47,729
There are no men left here.

1414
02:13:49,471 --> 02:13:51,872
There are no men left here?

1415
02:13:52,775 --> 02:13:53,799
They have all died!

1416
02:13:55,377 --> 02:13:56,708
No one can do anything!

1417
02:14:03,552 --> 02:14:06,249
You will have to do this alone.

1418
02:14:09,491 --> 02:14:10,754
All alone.

1419
02:14:11,694 --> 02:14:13,287

 don't need four men!

1420
02:14:13,729 --> 02:14:16,130
Kashi is sufficient to lift my body!

1421
02:15:56,432 --> 02:16:03,031
Boss, Kashinath will seek police...
protection when he spreads the ashes.

1422
02:16:03,505 --> 02:16:05,496
If you say so...

1423
02:17:00,362 --> 02:17:01,625
Take the handcuffs off Kashi!

1424
02:17:07,703 --> 02:17:10,104
Hey.. Kill the bastard!

1425
02:19:53,001 --> 02:19:57,461
Look...Issue an arrest warrant on Katya...
and all his brothers.

1426
02:19:58,340 --> 02:20:00,775
Him, all his thugs, immediately!

1427
02:20:07,382 --> 02:20:09,908
Not the police...

1428
02:20:11,286 --> 02:20:12,651
Not the police...

1429
02:20:13,956 --> 02:20:17,153
If you want to help....
don't interfere.

1430
02:20:18,493 --> 02:20:20,587
Keep away from this fight.

1431
02:20:20,963 --> 02:20:22,328
Kashi, those people have gone mad!

1432
02:20:22,764 --> 02:20:27,395
They kidnapped the boy by hiding in..
your house!

1433
02:20:27,669 --> 02:20:29,194

 don't know...
All they can do is kill him!

1434
02:20:29,972 --> 02:20:31,030
Let him die!

1435
02:20:31,239 --> 02:20:33,207
But Kashi...
They will kill the shopkeepers...

1436
02:20:33,542 --> 02:20:35,067
Let them die as well.

1437
02:20:36,211 --> 02:20:38,270
But now 
 don't need the police.

1438
02:20:39,881 --> 02:20:42,213
The one who will survive...
will be the one who is self sufficient.

1439
02:20:43,085 --> 02:20:44,917
Not by the crutches of the police...

1440
02:20:46,088 --> 02:20:48,386
In this either we will win...

1441
02:20:48,824 --> 02:20:50,019
...or we will have a clear loss.

1442
02:20:51,226 --> 02:20:53,285
Those who have guts...

1443
02:20:53,695 --> 02:20:55,493
will be the victors.

1444
02:20:56,565 --> 02:20:57,464
He will live who deserves too.

1445
02:23:11,466 --> 02:23:12,592
Where's the boy?

1446
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:25,679
Uncle!

1447
02:25:06,047 --> 02:25:06,912
Uncle!

1448
02:25:28,136 --> 02:25:29,695
Don't beat my uncle!

1449
02:25:49,357 --> 02:25:50,791
You didn't do good Kashinath.

1450
02:25:51,493 --> 02:25:52,289
Not right.

1451
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:57,093
The day 
 gained conscience...

1452
02:25:58,800 --> 02:25:59,858

 never cried.

1453
02:26:00,936 --> 02:26:02,870
But now you've made me cry.

1454
02:26:03,805 --> 02:26:08,868
First you hurt me, then you put...
salt on my wounds.

1455
02:26:10,078 --> 02:26:11,739
You didn't do right.

1456
02:26:15,150 --> 02:26:16,481
Takes a long time

1457
02:26:17,819 --> 02:26:19,787
to put fear into a person.

1458
02:26:21,222 --> 02:26:22,815
My life has now gone...

1459
02:26:24,326 --> 02:26:26,124
-..-.but not you!

1460
02:26:33,068 --> 02:26:34,365
We were seven brothers.

1461
02:26:36,504 --> 02:26:38,563
All of us lions.

1462
02:26:40,976 --> 02:26:44,537
Out of which you killed four.

1463
02:26:45,146 --> 02:26:46,545
Not four but five.

1464
02:26:54,990 --> 02:26:55,821
Wait!

1465
02:26:57,392 --> 02:26:58,223
What are you doing?

1466
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:02,794
If you kill him, they will make...
a statue of him.

1467
02:27:03,865 --> 02:27:05,060
People will worship him!

1468
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:08,599
Kill those who revere him!

1469
02:27:09,070 --> 02:27:12,096
So people will once again fear you!

1470
02:27:13,074 --> 02:27:14,974
Keep quite kidI....

1471
02:27:15,610 --> 02:27:16,577
Quite!

1472
02:27:17,579 --> 02:27:19,570
This is the first time you've talked...
sensible.

1473
02:27:28,023 --> 02:27:32,187
You will receive peace in your soul soon.

1474
02:27:33,495 --> 02:27:35,896
And my vow will soon come true.

1475
02:27:36,965 --> 02:27:39,297
The vow your brother took upon...
your death.

1476
02:27:40,468 --> 02:27:44,564
That while 
 don't take care...
of your murderer Katya...

1477
02:27:45,073 --> 02:27:46,973
I will stay here...

1478
02:27:48,009 --> 02:27:49,170
on their scraps!

1479
02:27:50,145 --> 02:27:52,079
In shame.

1480
02:27:52,347 --> 02:27:53,746
With this naked body!

1481
02:27:54,983 --> 02:27:56,974
But sister...

1482
02:27:57,519 --> 02:27:59,681
the day has come to cover it!

1483
02:28:00,555 --> 02:28:04,822
Because 
 have the destruction of...
Katya in Kashi's eyes.

1484
02:28:05,860 --> 02:28:07,419
Katya's destruction!

1485
02:28:44,899 --> 02:28:46,128
Come outside!

1486
02:28:47,368 --> 02:28:49,530
Look your master has come...your master!

1487
02:28:53,141 --> 02:28:54,802
Come and see your master!

1488
02:28:56,778 --> 02:28:58,906
Katya came to give your land back...

1489
02:28:59,547 --> 02:29:02,141
on that same land he crawls like an ant!

1490
02:29:04,452 --> 02:29:06,318
Your prophet is asking for water!

1491
02:29:06,921 --> 02:29:08,650
Is there anyone to give him water?

1492
02:29:10,492 --> 02:29:12,290
I made his father a dog!

1493
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:14,253
...and him a bull.

1494
02:29:15,396 --> 02:29:17,194
He fought alone for you...

1495
02:29:17,665 --> 02:29:19,064
is there a supporter of him left?

1496
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:20,859
Who will give him water?

1497
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:24,297
Anyone?

1498
02:29:37,652 --> 02:29:41,680
Look Kashinath...Your supporter has...
brought you water.

1499
02:29:42,357 --> 02:29:43,153
Let her go.

1500
02:29:49,664 --> 02:29:51,632
He asked me for land!

1501
02:29:52,066 --> 02:29:56,902
He asked for this space!
We will kill him on this land!

1502
02:29:57,272 --> 02:29:59,070
How will you kill him....how?

1503
02:29:59,340 --> 02:30:01,399
-You're dead yourself!
-You'll kill him?

1504
02:30:02,544 --> 02:30:05,946
Alone...alone he destroyed your empire!

1505
02:30:06,281 --> 02:30:09,649
-What do you have left?
-All your thugs have left you!

1506
02:30:09,984 --> 02:30:11,509
He killed all your brothers!

1507
02:30:13,555 --> 02:30:17,287
I'll make you dance on this very spot...
in front of all to see!

1508
02:30:17,659 --> 02:30:19,024
Make you dance now!

1509
02:30:19,327 --> 02:30:20,226
Let go!

1510
02:30:20,461 --> 02:30:21,724
How will you make me dance?

1511
02:30:21,963 --> 02:30:24,591
Making a man of yourself by tying...
him up?

1512
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:27,725
He will get up...he will!

1513
02:30:27,969 --> 02:30:29,994
He'll make a cabaret of you!

1514
02:30:30,371 --> 02:30:31,668
And you will dance!

1515
02:31:00,001 --> 02:31:00,968
Hit him...Hit him!

1520
02:34:33,681 --> 02:34:35,843
Leave me alone...I'll beat his rascal...

1521
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:39,347
No one will interferel. . I'll kill...

1522
02:34:39,987 --> 02:34:41,250

1527
02:35:00,641 --> 02:35:02,666
we have to spread grandpa's ashes.

1528
02:35:03,377 --> 02:35:04,435
Go.

1529
02:35:11,118 --> 02:35:17,387
