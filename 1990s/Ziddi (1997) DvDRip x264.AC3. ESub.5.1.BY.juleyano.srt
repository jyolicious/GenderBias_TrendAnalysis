Nobody in my family had
to do with politics ever.

6
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:03,798

As Deva makes smuggling

And you yourself used to

Guys like that are few tigers
of h, rtie: much ado about nothing.

00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,669
Shoot them a punch

174
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,749
Ganfhi ... another preacher!

00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:09,283
Gandhi, of course. You know what
great man was?

176
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:12,892

People are talking about ...

180
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:30,277
On the way you've beat

People will now Óntelege
My brother is a strong man!

182
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:38,317
Œnceteaza. If my father hears
Your praise ...

183
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,956
Big deal! Will certainly
then will sulk.

184
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:44,720
And I have to bring him a tray
with m, NCAR on camera!

185
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:50,331
Steel hear r, z, nd, right?

186
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,703
I do not think it is good to
certified by Deva at, t often.

187
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:01,044
I'm not saying it should
leave to make the head, but ...

188
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:03,346
Do you not love him?

189
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:06,476
This tray daughter

00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,951
- What?
- It's true.

192
00:14:11,221 --> 00:14:13,917
That I was not Ónseamna I
ignore mistakes.

193
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:19,118
One wrong step can make it on
a man regrets life.

194
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:22,525
I'm afraid of temperament
him on any case ...

195
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:28,471
Here! That's the signal for
Óncapat your son, nat come out on the street!

196
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:18,425
What's wrong with it on?

197
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,260
Why pl, NGI?

198
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:31,640
Do not tell us?

199
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,107
- Vilas today ...
- What did he do?

200
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:40,206
I cut way back.

201
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:43,752
C, when I asked to stap, NEASC,
I grabbed for me, never!

202
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,118
You Ónnebunit? Why did you have to
say that on his face?

203
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:53,286
Óntreb me what to do now?

204
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,023
What could I do, Mom?

205
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:58,692
- Come on!
- Brother ...

206
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:00,428
Deva! Wait!

207
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:01,602
Stop, Deva!

208
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:10,277
- Stop, Deva!
- May Ont, and listen to me, mother!

209
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,691
Stop it! Vilas steel will kill!

210
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:25,061
Wait, brother! Please!

211
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,724
It's a bill!

212
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,533
Remove the money, boys!

213
00:21:09,606 --> 00:21:11,471
Stop, Deva ...
Stop it, son!

214
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:37,829
I cut way back, bro!

215
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:42,132
C, when I said to stap, NEASC,
I grabbed my mother!

216
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:55,613
On leave it alone, Deva!
A die!

217
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:00,817
On leave it alone, Deva!

218
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:04,520
Let l, ll say!

219
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:12,065
Leave it!

220
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:26,910
What did you do?

221
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,879
My son is a murderer!

222
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:35,481
You're a killer!
Why not have died at birth?

223
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:41,023
I am the father cursed ...

224
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,692
Get it here on this
and close the jerk he is!

225
00:22:45,235 --> 00:22:47,135
Banish him forever!

226
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:50,469
I have such a son!

227
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:53,101
Get it here!

228
00:22:54,277 --> 00:22:56,370
IMO feared this day!

229
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,473
But none of you will
could Óntelege why I acted like that!

230
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:04,310
You thought I was his enemy Deva!

231
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:07,719
I never suspected that
jerk grow!

232
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,849
Oen what's wrong
On his education?

233
00:23:10,393 --> 00:23:11,621
Do not say that, sir ...

234
00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:14,727
Vilas my brother.

235
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,833
To what do ...

236
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:24,498
I think it deserves ...
even more severe punishment.

237
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:31,742
Why only Deva? No
brother can not tolerate ...

238
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,712
What he did not Deva
something shameful, sir!

239
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:41,322
But that my brother!

240
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:44,251
What did my brother!

241
00:23:44,794 --> 00:23:51,962
You gave both of the disease;
I never felt like a stranger here.

242
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:58,970
According to Article 307
Penal Code ...

243
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:03,438
Deva condemn the court ol ...
4 years of imprisonment.

244
00:24:05,048 --> 00:24:08,711
Do not worry, okay? I'm going to
Make Dad to agree.

245
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:12,077
We appeal.

246
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,613
Just do not ...

247
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:20,021
Hey, Akash ...
What are you doing?

248
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:25,497
I want to crash?
Akash!

249
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:41,416
Apply double symbol
bride's forehead.

250
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:52,986
Not so funny, sir ...

251
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:54,921
Your son ... married
and do not you tell us anything?

252
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:58,564
In fact, it has happened
Both the fast ONC, T. ..

253
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,069
My son ...

254
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,288
Deepu ... hey! Wait!

255
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:21,823
Wait!

256
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:25,751
Now look ... I had to be
Ont, mple, was Ont, mplat already.

257
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:28,226
Deva turns the day
after four years.

258
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,027
Just keep your cool ...
I've been talking with him.

259
00:25:32,469 --> 00:25:33,026
Brother!

260
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:36,069
Mom!

261
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:39,940
Be blessed, my son ~

262
00:25:46,116 --> 00:25:51,884
You must change your life, son.

263
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:57,087
I still think Œnca
done wrong, mama?

264
00:25:57,927 --> 00:25:58,586
See?

265
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:01,629
Has no opinion of
sorry for what he did!

266
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,760
I went to the police
and the court!

267
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,626
Even our relatives have been ...

268
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,236
My son came ... to imprisonment!

269
00:26:09,606 --> 00:26:11,335
After we made the r, s family ...

270
00:26:11,608 --> 00:26:13,542
Why has the nerve to Óntrebe ...
to hurt!

271
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:19,074
Please, sir ... forget the past.
To focus on the future.

272
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,284
Deva needs you now.
Your condition.

273
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:26,214
A man from the mistakes Ónvata
they do, Inder.

274
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:29,988
You can say, looking at him, that he regrets?

275
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,721
Yes, it's true that I do not regret anything.

276
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,193
That sense.

277
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,561
And I hate to get console
with a lie.

278
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:45,701
No need ... one family
should not tell him anything!

279
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:48,110
Family of c, shouted enough
from you.

280
00:26:48,578 --> 00:26:51,479
Your parents are honored
because you have given life!

281
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:55,007
Now leave us alone on ... family
can not bear you anymore!

282
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:02,219
Why take things at, t
away? We Óntelege ...

283
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,686
- I'll talk to him
- Have patience, sir.

284
00:27:05,228 --> 00:27:07,958
If you talk so, Deva
might Ónfuria and ...

285
00:27:08,231 --> 00:27:09,289
How can you say that?

286
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:11,825
- Everyone knows that ...
- Dad is right, Mom.

287
00:27:13,336 --> 00:27:15,236
That they are not willing to change me ...

288
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:17,997
It is my weakness ... or a
reflection of my stubbornness.

289
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:20,504
I am not allowed to do
else trouble for it!

290
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:27,911
Dad ... I'm sorry. I did not
offered no joy in life.

291
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:32,987
If I could ever
up to you ...

292
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:35,950
I have to believe that life ...
has reached my goal.

293
00:27:38,695 --> 00:27:43,428
Listen! Stop it ...
Deva Do not let go!

294
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:47,968
Stop, Deva ...
Listen to me!

295
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:50,738
Listen to what I say, Deva!

296
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:53,598
If we leave ...
I no longer remains in this house.

297
00:27:54,577 --> 00:27:57,102
Go with you!

298
00:27:57,814 --> 00:28:00,374
Do not do this, Akash.
Family needs you.

299
00:28:01,284 --> 00:28:04,344
Especially my father, who put
All hopes in you.

300
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:08,021
Do not disappoint.

301
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:30,910
Look who's here with me!

302
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,755
You have to sit there?
Do not hug me?

303
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:42,517
Let's see ...

304
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,960
Government money you made
a strong man!

305
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,495
Well ... You are a guest in this city
and the government visitor you?

306
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:55,761
I got a transfer here
After a lot of work!

307
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,405
There's nowhere that hometown!

308
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:00,666
You were moved here then?

309
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:03,712
Lord's assistant police!

310
00:29:04,314 --> 00:29:07,010
I am delighted your progress, Inder.

311
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,846
In fact, we needed
years to be promoted.

312
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,116
But I am truly amazed
your progress!

313
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,619
Deva ours is a man
important now, is not it?

314
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:20,828
You bear all stand talking here?

315
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:24,092
But when you come
best.

316
00:29:24,534 --> 00:29:26,729
Everyone at home will be
excited by your presence.

317
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:28,103
Now wait ...

318
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:32,571
You win money, Deva ...

319
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:34,273
But what about ...
emotional problems?

320
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:37,273
I mean, you found a girl?

321
00:29:37,547 --> 00:29:39,412
- A girl?
- I mean your marriage.

322
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:42,583
Marriage? Do not see what state is it?
I have courage.

323
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:45,279
Very good, smart guy ...
I criticize me?

324
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:48,249
I'm gonna find myself a girl
that would be like ...

325
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:49,684
- Like what?
- Like what?

326
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:32,200
Where are we going?

327
00:35:32,234 --> 00:35:33,667
You tell me?
Where the hell are we going?

328
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:35,699
Shut up and come with us.

329
00:35:46,782 --> 00:35:49,114
Now look: I'm not
spoke back!

330
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,477
I was busy working for you!

331
00:35:55,558 --> 00:35:57,788
Besides, not only
supporter of Prime Minister!

332
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:00,186
He has a few such people.

333
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:07,829
How many days hold in place a
Minister today ...

334
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:08,899
no one can tell!

335
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:12,774
These stories of cloak and dagger
that politicians will put them up to ...

336
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:15,006
CM ... support that it receives
from his friends ...

337
00:36:15,444 --> 00:36:18,277
Your problems ... and not
is our job!

338
00:36:19,648 --> 00:36:21,343
We've broken the deal, huh?

339
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:23,681
Police closed five
of our connections!

340
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,985
You promised not permit
three months ago?

341
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:31,089
What about this? And
do not the naive, right?

342
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:34,522
Watch what you say when
talk to me!

343
00:36:35,097 --> 00:36:36,029
Hey, dude!

344
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,295
Have you ever used this voice
determined before being elected?

345
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:44,138
And what ways we
you give lessons?

346
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:45,431
And you're talking with two tongues!

347
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:49,642
I already borrowed 50 million
the contract that you promised us!

348
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:51,879
All that money went on
drain, right?

349
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:56,517
Such ups and downs are
a normal business Lal Singh.

350
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,120
In any case ...

351
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:04,351
We will not win anything ...
suspects the latter it on Krishnakant.

352
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,559
Honestly, Mr. Jindal, had all
ready for CM's removal last month.

353
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,963
We prepared 19 MLA
to support us!

354
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:16,329
Nobody could have guessed that things
the central government will get worse.

355
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,164
Did you read the interview Governor
in the morning paper?

356
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:21,505
This is nothing more than scam!

357
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:24,572
I understand that, sir Krishnakant.
I understand everything.

358
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:28,979
We lose business and you
're screwed in politics.

359
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:40,726
You know that two of MLA
that he thought loyal

360
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:44,123
I joined ... to CM?
- You're wrong, Mr. Jindal!

361
00:37:44,433 --> 00:37:46,458
- Trust me ...
- Well, sir Krishnakant ...

362
00:37:46,735 --> 00:37:49,727
Your company distinguished ... taught me
something about politics!

363
00:37:50,306 --> 00:37:52,770
This is an example of manipulation
taking place right now ...

364
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,875
What happens, Mr. Jindl!
What's this?

365
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:02,411
We are with you, Krishnakant!

366
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:08,655
Swear that we will be
always with you!

367
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:22,668
Believe us, Mr. Jindal!

368
00:38:46,562 --> 00:38:47,854
Hurry up! Find out who he was!

369
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,647
They are!

370
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:58,665
Ask her! As has been paid
to stop my car?

371
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:01,861
Who were those guys who
Shoot me?

372
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:05,363
Make a mistake.
I just ...

373
00:40:05,674 --> 00:40:07,708
Girls like you would do anything
for a few rupees!

374
00:40:08,444 --> 00:40:11,880
That's right ... you recognized
what they are!

375
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:14,916
Yes, looks like a cheap whore ...

376
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,652
Need to dress ...
way to earn a living!

377
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,484
But that's because they are
dancer at a club.

378
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,321
I have to wear it
for public sake!

379
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:28,163
I hope you do not have to tell you ...

380
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:31,226
That no girl ... do not
that of her own desire.

381
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:34,928
I did not intentionally hit the car!

382
00:40:36,572 --> 00:40:39,905
Those men armed
wanted to kill me!

383
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:48,272
When I left after the
show, I saw killing someone!

384
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:54,111
Therefore follow me!

385
00:40:56,492 --> 00:40:58,687
Well ...
No need to cry.

386
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:02,928
Go home lady, Mani.

387
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:06,362
No need. I'm going alone.

388
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:08,836
I do not want any favors.

389
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:16,069
Find out where he lives and that
's her problem.

390
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:16,934
Excuse me ...

391
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:21,273
Could somebody take me home?

392
00:41:29,391 --> 00:41:29,920
To go.

393
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:34,120
You are not worthless!
You can not even get a girl?

394
00:41:34,463 --> 00:41:35,794
I did my best, sir ...

395
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,270
Okay ... let me alone!

396
00:41:53,982 --> 00:41:54,573
Are you married?

397
00:41:55,517 --> 00:41:59,715
I see ... do not like men.

398
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:02,184
My daughter has the same problem.

399
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:04,452
I wonder what is in his head.

400
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,450
Mom!

401
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:10,026
What was that? Did you start
barfeste me again, huh?

402
00:42:10,366 --> 00:42:13,426
- Not!
- So ... how's it going?

403
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:16,938
Did you take your medicine on time?

404
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:20,441
Course. And the doctor came
here to examine me.

405
00:42:21,043 --> 00:42:23,978
I told him that he has no sense!
My cough does not heal!

406
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:25,504
You must have had another
sour-snack (m Indian NCAR)

407
00:42:25,848 --> 00:42:28,078
No! I do not touch that!

408
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,278
You can not change, mom! You did not
doctor forbade me, NCAR spicy?

409
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:34,279
But I told him not to add
too many spices!

410
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,318
Ónsotitor bad aim ...

411
00:42:36,592 --> 00:42:39,925
Which always gives head ... as if
would Óntelege all ...

412
00:42:40,195 --> 00:42:41,619
The end ..., rsit by doing the same
mistake again!

413
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,262
- What you got for me?
- Apples and bananas.

414
00:42:45,033 --> 00:42:47,900
And how ram us with lam, s?
You have that?

00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,262
This is the first time that, when I looked!

416
00:42:49,638 --> 00:42:52,038
Okay, I'll share with neighbor.

417
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:56,400
I gave once-sour snack.

418
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,774
The doctor forbade him something too!

419
00:42:59,848 --> 00:43:00,837
And just as you're Óncrunti to me ...

420
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:03,341
Poor guy ... it took to get
On his wife every day!

I feel good here, mom ...

423
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:11,391
... But I had a
unpleasant experience last night.

424
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:12,989
Why? What has Ont, wrong?

425
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:15,991
You had a conflict with
new boss, right?

426
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:18,093
Not at all! Well ...
and an apple.

427
00:43:19,601 --> 00:43:21,330
You did not say anything about
your new job!

428
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:23,197
Hope you do not do something illegal ...

429
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:24,701
You Óncredere on me, right?

430
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:27,407

No ... we all Óncrederea on you.

432

If I recover, I'm gonna
find a suitable husband.

If you g ndesti to someone, tell me.

Already has that, few files on
police archives.

This is Khan, Mr. ... one

00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:56,192
You could say his job
is to kill for money.

evidence Ómpotriva these bandits.

00:45:08,877 --> 00:45:12,711
But we are sure that if they
four are put under control ...

458
00:45:13,181 --> 00:45:15,376
Crime will ...
disappear from the city.

Tell me something.

00:45:27,729 --> 00:45:28,727
Is there a problem, sir.

463
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:34,202
Our judicial system.

464
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,434
Legal formalities sky
long time, sir.

465
00:45:37,873 --> 00:45:39,670
And these people OSI
use financial strength ...

466
00:45:39,942 --> 00:45:41,876
And ... to engage the
Best Lawyers.

467
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:46,104
The law simply does not
can keep up with them ...

468
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:47,839
And ... our positions are weakened.

469
00:45:51,286 --> 00:45:55,086
But that's not the police Ónseamna
Óncrucisate arms should stay.

470
00:45:55,424 --> 00:45:57,685
- Not at all, sir.
- The Department must Óntreprinda something.

471
00:45:58,193 --> 00:45:59,785
We need special powers
for that, sir.

472
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:03,990
We need judges who
regardless of time,

473
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:06,994
Give us ... warrants
Ómpotriva these gangsters.

474
00:46:07,336 --> 00:46:08,701
We need special powers ...

475
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:11,005
Them ... to arrest any, when
consider necessary ...

476
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:13,297
And then that, when necessary, to the
We confess the truth ...

Their third degree measures Ómpotriva!

00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:19,944
I know it's much truth
On what you say.

479
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,785
But who can guarantee ...

480
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:28,417
If police ...
receives such power ...

481
00:46:29,224 --> 00:46:32,057
They will not abuse ...
their privileges?

482
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:39,727
If someone is caught
abuse, when these powers ...

483
00:46:40,102 --> 00:46:41,433
No ... he will not be spared!

484
00:46:42,437 --> 00:46:44,701
We must take
Ómpotriva's tough.

00:47:04,192 --> 00:47:06,057
This is for you, Akash.

489
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:18,769
Seems expensive.

490
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,175
You write history with that
pen hath one day.

491
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,112
I'll do something at, t
important with this pen?

492
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:27,838
It would be good to keep it so.

493
00:47:28,316 --> 00:47:30,546
It will be difficult to read history
that I write.

494
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,753
You're good at writing, Deva ...

495
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:35,854
Sherbet!

496
00:47:36,425 --> 00:47:39,019
The table is ready, but never arrived Inder Ónca

But we keep flam, Nzi

It was called just today. A policeman
OSI will owe Ont, i

499
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,206
So ...

500
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:06,186
C, t you provided Lal for
To clear the suburbs?

501
00:48:06,822 --> 00:48:08,915
- Tell me!
- I've never been there, sir ...

502
00:48:09,691 --> 00:48:10,988
In fact, I was away in Goa!

503
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,425
I know sheep criminals like you!

504
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:23,231
Do not touch it, sir ...
And we know the law.

I know what makes you
Both the arrogant!

506
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,282
You know you support
Your mentor, Lal Singh.

Which anyone can buy ...

508
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:42,317
Log you out ... and imprisonment!

509
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,719
But times have changed!

510
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:49,522
Time to get away
Lal's protection.

511
00:48:50,265 --> 00:48:56,568
Because I have to destroy
people like Lal in this city!

512
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:09,449
Well ... Lal is the one who executes.
But you're up to it.

513
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,476
Looks like we'll give
some very good news.

514
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:14,712

01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:23,706
Inder Saxena ...'s.

688
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:28,609
I fumbled around in his past Saxena.

689
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,710
It's not even a person
our liking.

690
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:36,323
Œnainte to str, nga screw ...

691
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:39,553
I ... have to eliminate.

692
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,327
No, Mr. Jindal.
Killer NDU it on Saxena

693
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:45,324
We can not afford ... to challenge
Highly skilled police department.

694
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:49,131
It's a known fact that no
a police officer ...

695
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:52,199
... Can not stand too long
burden of truth and honesty.

696
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:57,066
C When Saxena will Óntelege this
work will transfer.

697
01:02:58,012 --> 01:03:01,243
I think we should give them
Ónca three months.

698
01:03:01,682 --> 01:03:02,842
After three months ...

699
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:06,079
If things do not happen ...
as planning ...

700
01:03:06,654 --> 01:03:09,350
... You have to kill
Saxena you Ónsuti.

701
01:03:10,324 --> 01:03:11,882
How can I promise that?

702
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:16,356
Time and death are things
no one can predict.

703
01:03:17,832 --> 01:03:22,201
As you will live to see me
killer NDU him three months ...

704
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:24,304
Could anyone guarantee that?

705
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:46,083
Lord!

706
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,255
- How are you?
- I'm okay, son.

707
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:20,753
I would have been dead if I had
remained on the other hospital.

708
01:04:21,729 --> 01:04:23,856
I got a new life here.

709
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:28,334
Why are you looking at me?

710
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:30,797
Œncerc to figure out who you are ...

711
01:04:31,806 --> 01:04:35,037
Where did you east to
We get rid of our problems?

712
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:37,978
Someone not at, t much
even its people.

713
01:04:38,412 --> 01:04:40,403
- What we do for you?
- What did you do?

714
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:43,715
Œmi ensure treatment ...
You engaged daughter.

715
01:04:44,085 --> 01:04:45,347
By the way ... how do the work?

716
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:57,596
It's a bit immature ... forgive her if
says something stupid.

717
01:04:58,132 --> 01:05:01,295
Has a sharp tongue that
grew up without her father.

718
01:05:01,569 --> 01:05:03,867
Do not worry about it ...
take care of yourself.

719
01:05:04,438 --> 01:05:06,565
Do what your doctor says ...

720
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,468
And to stay away from ...
m, NCAR spicy.

721
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:13,573
- I'll be back to see you.
- Very well, son.

722
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:27,840
Why should not worry on
about Guddi's marriage?

723
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:31,076
Can not sit with us
life.

724
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:35,272
I g, ndesc the condition
I grew up with it.

725
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:39,985
I was ready at any
to make it happy.

726
01:08:40,988 --> 01:08:44,583
The idea for her to go ...

727
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:47,193
Be Ónconjurata of ...
unknown people ...

728
01:08:47,294 --> 01:08:49,262
Location will Guddi

729
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:55,295

01:08:56,437 --> 01:09:00,669

Wear our bad sister ...

Who's that?

733
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:13,218
The remaining family members already
I took "interviews" ...

734
01:09:13,454 --> 01:09:14,946
... And I have found to their liking.

735
01:09:16,757 --> 01:09:18,054
However, if you insist ...

736
01:09:23,697 --> 01:09:26,165
Guddi is the only sister I have!

737
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:30,860

Gang leaders ...

... In town, on police files ...

752
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,218

Please, my friend.
Please do not come to my wedding.

757

How about, Inder?

758
01:10:42,376 --> 01:10:45,675
How could marry Guddi without
Deva's this? You know that, long t ...

01:10:49,516 --> 01:10:50,448
Inder is right.

I would like the wedding

761
01:11:00,227 --> 01:11:01,489

It's not a doll?

773
01:12:18,372 --> 01:12:20,499
What's wrong with you online?

774
01:12:22,843 --> 01:12:27,212
Oen that Hal brought us life, Deva?

Guddi ... No pl, blood.

780
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:55,370
You will stay away from us, right?

781
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:57,943
You have to live on this city!

01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:02,046
Oen Besides, I was never Óngadui
Your husband will be transferred here.

Both the poor girls have tea

Their parents will bless me, nta.

788
01:13:23,537 --> 01:13:26,665
What more beautiful gift I could ask for?

789
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,872
Take the Guddi home Akash.

790
01:13:30,777 --> 01:13:32,267
Probably expect.

Now, son ... Take this money and

Well ... you can keep the rest.

Not insist, madam.

Gorgeous! Œti you lose your job
IMO if you buy a snack!

797
01:13:58,305 --> 01:13:59,529
What kind of hospital is this?

798
01:13:59,906 --> 01:14:02,807
Dying to have a snack ...
and no one cares!

799
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:06,040
Very well then ... leave.
Go save your job.

800
01:14:07,314 --> 01:14:10,283
Aminabee, working at the dairy
slums and live on ...

01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:12,075
Has a problem ... on her house.

802

Lady!

01:14:47,754 --> 01:14:51,019
Deva! You have arrived, my son?

804
01:14:51,258 --> 01:14:54,557
Yes ... what is it?

805
01:14:54,795 --> 01:14:56,922
Look what people are saying
the slums!

806
01:14:57,264 --> 01:14:59,630
Say I poisoned the kids!

807
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:02,498
I would do that?

808
01:15:02,903 --> 01:15:09,331
We brought milk from dairy
to feed my children.

809
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,974
How could turn on poison?

810
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:15,010
- Where's the milk?
- There.

811
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:21,146
Is it Laptaria that the left hand switch
from Malad Railway.

812
01:15:21,621 --> 01:15:23,145
From there we took milk /

813

Laptaria of it, nga passage
railway?

814
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:27,222
There's only one dairy ...

And that dairy belong, NDU's
Jindal's was imprisonment!

816
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:32,020
This is not milk ...
It's a narcotic.

817
01:16:13,206 --> 01:16:14,605
Go ahead and call them.

818
01:16:15,575 --> 01:16:18,373
They definitely come ...
just to carry your bier!

819
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:19,501
Move!

820
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:27,052
Drop your weapons!

821
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,853
Send away women
and children, Mani!

822
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:34,958
Hurry up, guys! Get out of here!

823
01:16:35,862 --> 01:16:36,692
Hurry up, ma'am ...

824
01:16:37,464 --> 01:16:41,423
Hurry up, guys! Take care
where you step!

825
01:18:58,805 --> 01:19:00,099
I hope you're on all
mind, Deva!

826
01:19:00,307 --> 01:19:01,274
You're a devil ...

827
01:19:02,142 --> 01:19:05,543
Poison ... that would sell as
m, NCAR to c, Stig money!

828
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:09,637
Do not make the mistake of challenging myself, Deva!

829
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:14,781
Œti you put on life-threatening!

830
01:19:15,522 --> 01:19:18,184
People are usually
cremated after death.

831
01:19:18,725 --> 01:19:20,488
But if he Ont, MPLA
some children ...

832
01:19:21,061 --> 01:19:26,556
You will be the first ...
incinerated alive!

833
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,045
Well, sir ... would not you
Óntorci home early today?

834
01:19:50,423 --> 01:19:52,914
Watch the clock ... View

835
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,987
Œmi realize that, Shobha, but ...

836
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:58,487
You can not get away
what to do, right?

837
01:19:59,032 --> 01:20:02,058
I had to keep store
Imprisonment for five days.

838
01:20:02,669 --> 01:20:05,467
And Ónca have a lot to do.

839
01:20:05,872 --> 01:20:08,033
But I promise to fix everything
On that, a few days!

840
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,634
Well ... Come home c, when you have time.

841
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:14,974
But Deepu and I have decided, t
we will have lunch with you today.

842
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:16,441
Now listen, Shobha ...

843
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:24,416
- There you go!
- My wife is sick, sir ...

844
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:25,950
And I have to rush ...
to get to the hospital.

845
01:20:26,292 --> 01:20:29,819
But the work commence at 7 p.m. And they
need these materials on tonight.

846
01:20:30,764 --> 01:20:33,631
Well, give me the keys to the van.
We do shipment on the way home.

847
01:21:03,396 --> 01:21:04,760
There seems to be no one around.

848
01:21:09,402 --> 01:21:10,733
But there's someone up there.

849
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:39,855
But we must do something ...
and Deva.

850
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,732
- But the minister is ...
- Quiet! We know everything!

851
01:21:46,473 --> 01:21:49,340
I've already lost money.

852
01:21:49,709 --> 01:21:54,203
Krishnakant simply not
State on the minister to bring him on his knees

853
01:21:55,615 --> 01:22:00,746
And it's not our interest on him
May let live.

854
01:22:02,021 --> 01:22:04,080
Œmi like this feature yours, Khan.

855
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:09,152
Attack the problem directly and
bluntly.

856
01:22:10,663 --> 01:22:13,757
Minister does not want to quit.

857

01:31:12,004 --> 01:31:12,732

01:36:27,252 --> 01:36:30,585
Akash's death not suicide
Inder! He was murdered!

966
01:36:31,190 --> 01:36:33,488
Why clean stairs building
On that night?

967
01:36:34,093 --> 01:36:35,117
What happened there?

968
01:36:36,395 --> 01:36:42,561

Look, Deva ... methods

972
01:37:02,588 --> 01:37:05,250
is completely wrong!

973
01:37:06,258 --> 01:37:08,883
Do not you realize that Lal Singh
you could even give on judgment?

974
01:37:09,728 --> 01:37:11,491
As you can accuse
attempted murder?

975
01:37:12,364 --> 01:37:17,631
I'm the one who has received a blow
the death of my brother.

976
01:37:19,204 --> 01:37:22,230
For the law, the death of Akash
it's just another case ...

977
01:37:23,409 --> 01:37:28,437
Which will receive a total ...
then the case will be imprisonment.

978
01:37:29,448 --> 01:37:34,476
C When I find out who is responsible ...

979
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:37,254
I have to adjust accounts ...
for my brother's death ...

980
01:37:37,456 --> 01:37:38,616
... On my way.

981
01:37:56,742 --> 01:37:59,939
Wait.

982
01:38:01,346 --> 01:38:02,870
I arrested this man ...

01:38:03,716 --> 01:38:06,844
Who killed ... and one of
Our officers, Inspector Kulkarni.

984
01:38:11,256 --> 01:38:14,555
I'm sure this man knows
More about Akash's death.

985
01:38:15,861 --> 01:38:19,592
I had an injection which
On ten minutes ...

986
01:38:19,998 --> 01:38:21,322

991
01:39:00,939 --> 01:39:02,236
Pig was killed!

992
01:39:04,076 --> 01:39:09,639
No suicide ... were sacrificed
for STAP,'s null.

993
01:39:10,883 --> 01:39:16,378
Do not see why the law is
On powerless against crime?

994
01:39:18,157 --> 01:39:22,093
Is not that your department
have dedicated people like John.

995
01:39:33,639 --> 01:39:36,233
You made several p, not now.

996

Óndepartezi you do not want us, right?

1002
01:40:03,268 --> 01:40:05,793
I do not want to riskier
lives for my sake.

1003
01:40:06,638 --> 01:40:09,163
Insult us say that when Deva.

1004

Hotel and giving us
other business ...

1005

Óncerci ... put a price on
our contribution, is not it?

1006
01:40:16,281 --> 01:40:18,511
- I mean, Rashid ...
- Rashid is right!

1007
01:40:19,985 --> 01:40:22,545
I swore to stand by each other and
the better, but worse, right?

1008
01:40:22,955 --> 01:40:24,946
How can you keep your worries
just for you?

1009
01:40:25,991 --> 01:40:29,188
You proved it today, Deva!

1010
01:40:30,329 --> 01:40:32,229
I was never "to" you ...

1011
01:40:32,998 --> 01:40:36,764
I just worked "for" you!

1012
01:41:04,696 --> 01:41:06,926
My head! My teachings, rte again!
I've had enough ...

Perhaps you are tired of
old things, right?

1041

So that, when open the windows

01:42:49,801 --> 01:42:53,202
Thanks to my daughter, Jaya,

Get to marry soon, God ...
Me to play with their children.

1048
01:43:06,618 --> 01:43:08,552
Welcome, Inder ... Log.

1049
01:43:09,454 --> 01:43:10,443
Let merchandise there.

1050
01:43:10,922 --> 01:43:13,720
These bags are 15 million
rupees cash ...

1051
01:43:14,059 --> 01:43:17,586
On gold bullion ... and € 20
millions were brought across the border.

1052
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:19,121
Sit down.

1053
01:43:20,365 --> 01:43:24,131
I captured this merchandise hath a
Apartment in Dahisar, sir.

1054
01:43:24,569 --> 01:43:25,260
You made arrests?

1055
01:43:26,338 --> 01:43:29,307
The apartment is passed by name
a certain Hasmujk Patel, sir.

1056
01:43:29,608 --> 01:43:31,508
But there stood two men ...

1057
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:33,505
Tenants ... for two months.

1058
01:43:33,945 --> 01:43:37,039
I told the owner and
other tenants ...

1059
01:43:37,282 --> 01:43:38,943
A business ... they dress.

1060
01:43:39,818 --> 01:43:41,581
But on the last two days ...

1061
01:43:41,887 --> 01:43:44,385
Their house was imprisonment ... and those
people disappeared.

1062
01:43:44,723 --> 01:43:47,157
He obviously knew the
Our operation.

1063
01:43:49,461 --> 01:43:52,828
These people may have
ties Deva or Jindal.

1064
01:43:53,532 --> 01:43:56,057
He can not, sir ...
secure connections there.

1065
01:43:56,368 --> 01:43:57,858
Deva has surely
to do with them.

1066
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:04,069
C When you arrest ol Deva sir ...
I wish to be present.

1067
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:06,102
Œntruc, t are convinced ...

1068
01:44:06,678 --> 01:44:10,842
Óndrazni ... no one will give him
Deva's way if you are present.

1069
01:44:11,216 --> 01:44:12,444
Continue your work, Inder.

1070
01:44:13,418 --> 01:44:17,115
I will find him, you nga
Oric, when you need it.

1071
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:26,859
The Akash left him, nga us ...

1072
01:44:27,132 --> 01:44:29,032
I stay ... it's hard to on the house.

1073
01:44:30,435 --> 01:44:32,494
The mutual consolation.

1074
01:44:33,305 --> 01:44:35,671
But it's hard to answer the
Deepu's Óntrebarile.

1075
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:39,036
Father and consoles all ...

1076

I saw ... but pl, ng, when on his room.

1077

Everyone loved him ...

1078

I never hurt anyone.

1079
01:44:53,592 --> 01:44:57,688
I found this pen
l nga Akash's body.

1080
01:44:59,564 --> 01:45:05,025
He who has the cap ...
Akash's's killer.

1081
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:07,338
I certainly found him hath day.

1082
01:45:08,773 --> 01:45:10,741
We have to find him, Guddi.

1083
01:45:34,266 --> 01:45:36,257
Why are all the lights off?

1084
01:45:41,606 --> 01:45:45,167
How you Óntorci at, t to t, rziu?

1085

- What am I to you now?
- You are my husband.

1093
01:46:26,217 --> 01:46:29,482
In this case, you do what Oti says!

1094
01:46:30,455 --> 01:46:35,392
You do just what I say Oti!

1095
01:46:35,994 --> 01:46:39,259
Deva is a killer ... and I
I'm a police officer.

Have to get used to forget Deva.

But I knew it all the time.

1199
02:05:23,387 --> 02:05:25,981
- I want to talk Saxena!
- He's not here now.

1200
02:05:28,058 --> 02:05:31,027
- What's this?
- Inder called me, Haya.

1201
02:05:31,528 --> 02:05:33,291
And Jindal him to Ómpuscat the minister!

1202
02:05:34,031 --> 02:05:35,896
If I have left there,
would be killed.

1203
02:05:37,201 --> 02:05:40,364
Lu, when on account Ómprejurarile
I ran away on ...

1204
02:05:40,604 --> 02:05:42,034

1206
02:05:48,312 --> 02:05:49,574
Inder ... why not get there?

1207
02:05:53,183 --> 02:05:56,084
There's a shadow on Óndoiala terms
they provide security department.

1208
02:05:56,754 --> 02:05:58,984
So that, when we can not
protect a person ...

1209
02:05:59,356 --> 02:06:01,483
What it definitely ...
We guarantee citizens?

1210
02:06:02,025 --> 02:06:03,356
Why can not Ónteleg is ...

1211

Despite this ... as on a
able officer like you ...

1212
02:06:06,764 --> 02:06:09,194
How did ... Deva and his bandits
take him there the minister?

1213
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:13,531
Unbelievable! I am very disappointed
the mistakes they've made!

1214
02:06:13,837 --> 02:06:15,304
C, when the minister has called you there ...

1215
02:06:15,606 --> 02:06:18,734
Why do not you ... Take
necessary precautions?

1216
02:06:19,376 --> 02:06:21,435
Why did you take with you
so few officers>

02:06:22,379 --> 02:06:24,506
Minister haste me

1218
02:06:24,848 --> 02:06:26,572
I determined to ...
run there immediately.

1219
02:06:27,751 --> 02:06:30,311
But that, when we got there,
I found Deva ...

1220
02:06:30,587 --> 02:06:32,817
... Go, NDU it back on the minister!

1221
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:35,121
It was hard for us to ochim it ...

1222
02:06:35,559 --> 02:06:37,424
So ... I have hit
the minister on the shooting!

1223
02:06:37,661 --> 02:06:40,630

1224
02:06:41,198 --> 02:06:42,961

I will endeavor to
Óncrederea reward, sir.

1226
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:50,269

1227
02:06:51,041 --> 02:06:54,033
OEL want to Deva ... dead or alive.

02:06:54,711 --> 02:06:56,611
I put on alert all
14 areas, sir.

1229
02:06:57,214 --> 02:07:00,206
Our people search through all
town to find it.

1230
02:07:00,484 --> 02:07:02,384
I put 250 officers
On this operation ...

1231
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:05,051
And every out of town ...
was imprisonment.

1232
02:07:05,856 --> 02:07:09,257
'll Catch on clean steel, when the Deva.

1233
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:10,956
A special announcement.

1234

The Prime Minister was Ómpuscat On
This morning at 11 a.m.

1235
02:07:15,499 --> 02:07:17,194
A criminal ... named Deva.

1236
02:07:18,135 --> 02:07:21,935
Minister guards fought back ...

1237
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:24,571
But despite all efforts ... on ...

1238
02:07:24,908 --> 02:07:26,876
Deva escaped Ómpreuna ...
Prime Minister.

1239
02:07:27,244 --> 02:07:30,543
Minister for assault and kidnapping ...

Why these actions ... ...

1241
02:07:32,783 --> 02:07:38,653
Ónca be explained ...
by the police.

1242
02:07:39,456 --> 02:07:41,490
I did not say they do not know
nothing about Deva?

1243
02:07:42,292 --> 02:07:43,725
Why do not you think?

1244
02:07:44,528 --> 02:07:45,995
I really do not know where Deva!

1245
02:07:46,463 --> 02:07:48,693
Everyone remember to commence
then c, when coming here.

1246
02:07:49,166 --> 02:07:51,361
But gradually the truth
comes out.

1247
02:07:51,902 --> 02:07:54,564
What? What do you mean?

1248
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:58,340
It's not fair to harass me
as you do!

1249
02:07:59,209 --> 02:08:01,302
You can not harass a citizen
guilty on like this!

1250
02:08:02,279 --> 02:08:04,247
I'm a lawyer ...
I know the law!

1251
02:08:06,083 --> 02:08:08,847
Your son, murderer,
running from the law ...

1252
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:10,809
And you have the nerve to ...
I Ónveti law?

1253
02:08:13,991 --> 02:08:17,154
You should not have to do that,
Officer.

My tears Ónseamna

If you find it, you doborÓ
c,'re a man like you ...

02:08:26,236 --> 02:08:28,067
For every tear ...
I paid it!

1257
02:08:30,007 --> 02:08:31,167
Are you happy?

1258
02:08:32,175 --> 02:08:34,707
I told you he does not know anything.
But you have to do that.

1259
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,045
Forgive him, Father ... Please forgive him!

1260
02:08:39,283 --> 02:08:41,080
I am an honest man, Inder ...

1261
02:08:42,119 --> 02:08:44,280
I did not tell a lie
life!

1262
02:08:46,023 --> 02:08:49,618
Nobody in my house
Deva knows where!

1263
02:08:50,127 --> 02:08:52,994
- I know that, Dad ...
- They do not know anything!

1264
02:08:53,363 --> 02:08:54,830
You look on TV.

1265
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:56,224
What show?

1266
02:08:56,934 --> 02:08:59,459
Anyone who provides information about
you will be rewarded.

1267
02:09:00,337 --> 02:09:06,708
- Do you reward?
- No.

1268
02:09:10,747 --> 02:09:13,375
Ónca police state was not on him
find the Deva.

1269
02:09:13,650 --> 02:09:17,086
I pulled the bullets from
his body, lady.

1270
02:09:17,621 --> 02:09:19,179
But his condition
deteriorates rapidly.

1271
02:09:19,623 --> 02:09:22,148
I gotta go to the hospital ...
If not, you can die!

1272
02:09:22,693 --> 02:09:25,526
I told you already that
we can not go to a hospital.

1273
02:09:25,996 --> 02:09:27,987
Very well!
Do what you want!

1274
02:09:28,899 --> 02:09:31,663
But I can not stay here!
I want to go now!

1275
02:09:40,377 --> 02:09:43,141
Only Óncearca to remember
who you're dealing with!

1276
02:09:44,081 --> 02:09:46,345
I explain just once ...

1277
02:09:47,818 --> 02:09:49,183
I want him to live ...

1278
02:09:49,786 --> 02:09:52,016
... Not to save my skin,
because he knows the truth.

1279
02:09:52,623 --> 02:09:54,750
But he's a good man!

1280
02:09:55,959 --> 02:09:58,826
Got anything else to say?

1281
02:10:00,831 --> 02:10:03,356
What I c, Stig? What I c, Stig
in this farce?

1282
02:10:05,869 --> 02:10:11,671
Lal Oen, we lost a
friend who was like a brother to me.

1283
02:10:12,976 --> 02:10:14,776
And you still have not been able to on
Deva do anything on now!

1284
02:10:16,146 --> 02:10:19,274
All this ... just for you
did you get there on time!

1285
02:10:20,584 --> 02:10:23,644
And that, when you arrived, officers
those t, mpiti Ónsoteau you.

1286
02:10:24,888 --> 02:10:27,789
Because of your
Deva escaped!

1287
02:10:28,959 --> 02:10:31,086
If you had killed Deva
there, on the spot ...

1288
02:10:32,029 --> 02:10:34,429
Received much praise ... you.

1289
02:10:34,664 --> 02:10:36,224
You have occurred on the first
page of newspapers ...

1290
02:10:36,767 --> 02:10:39,668
Assassin to kill ...!

1291
02:10:41,071 --> 02:10:45,167
I'm the one who fired on the minister.

1292
02:10:46,343 --> 02:10:48,743
If he survives attack
and confess ...

1293
02:10:54,151 --> 02:10:59,054
If you have the slightest problem,
You can be sure, Inder Saxena ...

1294
02:11:01,324 --> 02:11:04,919
Mr. Jindal! You have not complied
Óntelegere your side!

1295
02:11:05,595 --> 02:11:08,155
You must kill
Minister. But you missed!

1296
02:11:08,665 --> 02:11:10,462
Do not yell at me, Inder Saxena!

1297
02:11:12,035 --> 02:11:14,629
You're not important enough
to raise your voice at me!

1298
02:11:14,905 --> 02:11:18,170
You can yell at subordinates
On your desk!

1299
02:11:18,475 --> 02:11:19,999
It has nothing to do
with my position.

1300
02:11:20,477 --> 02:11:22,536
All I'm saying is that,
whatever the ONT, mplat ...

1301
02:11:28,385 --> 02:11:30,649
Why Inder spoke with Jindal?

1302
02:11:35,992 --> 02:11:37,220
Your clothes, ma'am.

1303
02:11:42,766 --> 02:11:43,630
- What ...
- Take the money.

1304
02:11:44,267 --> 02:11:45,564
But I rest.

What's this?

1308
02:11:59,783 --> 02:12:01,375
Inder gets sloppy.

1309
02:12:41,124 --> 02:12:43,149
"I found this pen
l nga Akash's body. "

1310
02:12:43,793 --> 02:12:46,023
"Who has the cap ..."

1311
02:12:46,897 --> 02:12:48,797
"Is Akash's killer:.

1312
02:12:50,901 --> 02:12:54,234

Listen, do you?

1316
02:14:13,083 --> 02:14:14,710
Yes, you heard right. Continue ...

1317
02:14:14,985 --> 02:14:18,421
- You know, brother!
- What should you know?

1318
02:14:18,688 --> 02:14:19,916

I need to know who
Akash killed him!

1322
02:14:32,535 --> 02:14:33,124
Who was?

1323
02:14:34,371 --> 02:14:35,065
Brother ...

1324
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:54,149
Gorgeous!

1325
02:14:55,392 --> 02:15:00,420
For the first time, see c, t
OSI sister loves his brother more ...

02:15:01,698 --> 02:15:05,361
I saw her today for the first time!

1327
02:15:08,605 --> 02:15:09,902
What were you about to say?

1328
02:15:11,341 --> 02:15:13,639
Me I killed Akash?

1329
02:15:15,178 --> 02:15:16,941
You were about to tell
my name is not it?

1330
02:15:18,148 --> 02:15:22,346
Yes ... I killed myself Akash.

1331
02:15:24,621 --> 02:15:25,583
But do not be surprised.

1332
02:15:26,656 --> 02:15:27,850
Œti remember, right ...

1333
02:15:29,092 --> 02:15:34,962
Deva ... what your brother did to
arm pulled my brother Vilas?

1334

On while I ... I saw
p suffering, not death!

1336
02:15:47,177 --> 02:15:48,109
What shocking betrayal!

1337
02:15:49,446 --> 02:15:56,545
Our relationship, love and dance,
Our marriage ... it was just that?

1338
02:15:58,421 --> 02:16:00,855
You did something despicable, Inder!

1339
02:16:02,992 --> 02:16:06,894
You killed my brother!

1340
02:16:08,231 --> 02:16:12,531
God will not
forgive me for that!

1341
02:16:12,936 --> 02:16:14,626
God can not hear
from such a distance ...

1342
02:16:15,205 --> 02:16:16,832
Well ... not stand hearing.

1343
02:16:18,007 --> 02:16:22,467
You will have to go on
heaven to talk to him.

1344
02:16:29,986 --> 02:16:32,216
My wife ... yet
I figure on exposed!

1345
02:18:48,691 --> 02:18:49,853
Why are all these
cops here?

1346
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:51,956
What's up, Deva?

1347
02:18:52,929 --> 02:18:54,590
Wait here ... I'll go check.

1348
02:19:52,622 --> 02:19:53,816
Take the car out!

1349
02:20:30,627 --> 02:20:31,321
"In God ... stay Truth"

1350
02:20:31,794 --> 02:20:33,659
"In God ... stay Truth"

1351
02:22:16,466 --> 02:22:20,960
"He talks about you
the neighborhood. "

1352
02:22:21,237 --> 02:22:23,671
"The way you've put on the run
those guys ... was superb. "

1353
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:28,006
"Everyone knows now that
My brother is a hero. "

1354
02:22:33,015 --> 02:22:35,142
"More ONT and let me me
sister concern ... "

1355
02:22:35,518 --> 02:22:36,815
"... On the wedding dress."

1356
02:22:40,356 --> 02:22:42,290
"Listen, do you?"

1357
02:22:42,558 --> 02:22:45,288
"We need to know who
Akash killed him. "

1358
02:22:56,439 --> 02:22:58,168
I came to the remains
pam, ntesti of my daughter.

1359
02:22:58,708 --> 02:23:00,539
But her brother has already taken.

1360
02:23:01,410 --> 02:23:03,708
- Who? Deva?
- Yes ... that's his name.

1361
02:23:18,728 --> 02:23:21,925
Now remember on the
whose remains you brought.

1362
02:24:52,021 --> 02:24:54,216
Why was enhanced
security, Shinde?

1363
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:56,655
- Order the head, sir.
- Why?

1364
02:24:57,226 --> 02:24:58,659
It's about me

1365
02:25:00,897 --> 02:25:01,420
Go!

1366
02:25:09,038 --> 02:25:10,670
Œmbunatatirea security, between really!

1367
02:25:57,887 --> 02:26:00,253
- Hi, Mr. Jindal!
- Yes, Inder?

1368
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:01,984
I Ónteles, on end, rsit.

1369
02:26:02,558 --> 02:26:06,392
We Óntrebam the
Guddi had found ...

1370
02:26:06,729 --> 02:26:08,890
... That I could have
Exposed on Akash's killer?

1371
02:26:09,365 --> 02:26:10,593
What was it?

1372
02:26:12,134 --> 02:26:15,934
She had found cover
Akash's pen ...

1373
02:26:16,238 --> 02:26:18,229
Same ... and gave
Deva's phone!

1374
02:26:19,709 --> 02:26:21,973
Poor soul! Brother
they died without Óndoiala ...

1375
02:26:22,345 --> 02:26:25,109
And sister ... she was murdered!

1376
02:26:25,581 --> 02:26:27,549
Even after death, she ...

1377
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:30,011
Gave us last ... evidence
On this crime.

1378
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:35,723
Akash's deaths and Guddi
will ram us a mystery!

1379
02:26:37,727 --> 02:26:41,288
To tell you the truth, Mr. Jindal ...

1380
02:26:41,597 --> 02:26:43,861
Even c ... When I saw
My brother's corpse, Vilas ...

1381
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:47,263
On fire ... was a heart
which was extinguished.

1382
02:27:03,953 --> 02:27:06,922
What repulsive show that, when
are exposed, Inder!

1383
02:27:30,813 --> 02:27:35,750
Deva! Do not touch me, Deva!

1384
02:27:36,018 --> 02:27:37,815
For the sake of your father!
For your mother!

1385
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,618
I'm your sister's husband!

1386
02:27:55,137 --> 02:27:56,297
Here's my book!

1387
02:27:56,739 --> 02:27:58,798
It's a ten leaf!

1388
02:28:34,243 --> 02:28:37,303
Give me peace on!
Ónca pig is on life!

1389
02:28:38,247 --> 02:28:39,373
I'll kill him!

1390
02:28:40,549 --> 02:28:41,743
You must kill the bastard!

1391
02:28:42,384 --> 02:28:45,319
Let me! I'm going to make pieces!

1392
02:28:55,364 --> 02:28:59,061
He used to talk too much!

1393
02:28:59,969 --> 02:29:03,632
But Deva took him on Home
beat him like a c holds!

1394
02:29:03,973 --> 02:29:07,170
C, when they could not protect him
Ónsusi, how will we defend ourselves?

1395
02:29:07,943 --> 02:29:12,039
He used to boast as if
On police had Óntreaga pocket.

1396
02:29:13,082 --> 02:29:17,519
But no matter ... I hope Jindal
drew a lesson from this.

1397
02:29:17,787 --> 02:29:19,482
Well ... you got to Jindal?

1398
02:29:19,722 --> 02:29:20,279
Yes, sir ...

1399
02:29:23,225 --> 02:29:27,184
- Give me the boss on the phone.
- Not at home, sir.

1400
02:29:27,696 --> 02:29:29,755
It's not home? Where is it?

1401
02:29:30,232 --> 02:29:33,201
- He went to the police station.
- For what?

1402
02:29:33,702 --> 02:29:36,637
I do not know. But he went
after he called Mr Inder.

1403
02:29:36,906 --> 02:29:38,373
That's the limit!

1404
02:29:39,642 --> 02:29:43,134
Must there,
console, NDU it on Inder!

1405
02:29:44,246 --> 02:29:45,941
This man has lost his mind!

Give me drink.

1407
02:30:04,667 --> 02:30:05,656
Why tremble, Khan?

02:30:09,305 --> 02:30:10,897
Not me, Deva!

02:30:31,026 --> 02:30:32,015

After you have destroyed joys

No! Do not make the mistake of her

This man is a murderer ...

And a criminal ... not
religion ... no faith!

1435
02:32:39,355 --> 02:32:43,018
These demons have deleted
pam on the face of the earth!

1436
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:44,724
God Œnsusi decided t it!

1437

This is also your court, Deva!

Go and do right ...
Just do right, Deva!

1439
02:35:26,922 --> 02:35:28,382
Someone sent a corpse
for you, sir.

1440
02:35:35,497 --> 02:35:36,861
It's a call for you, Mr. Jindal.

1441
02:35:40,302 --> 02:35:42,133
You hid on

Inder probably has c, initial and
Ónsusi him on guard around you, right?

1443
02:35:48,210 --> 02:35:49,234
But that's a good thing.

1444
02:35:50,379 --> 02:35:51,468
In it, nga your death ...

1445
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:54,776
Police Department will ...
get rid of their garbage.

1446
02:35:56,919 --> 02:35:58,716
That looks good
body, Jindal.

1447
02:35:59,888 --> 02:36:01,082
It's the same Khan ...

1448

That kills people ...
to your order.

1449

This is the fate that
you will have, doubt.

Need to clean wounds.

1454

02:37:11,026 --> 02:37:14,894
It's near the old fort
L-nga Malvani village.

1464
02:37:15,931 --> 02:37:18,923
Minister's critical condition.

1465
02:37:19,701 --> 02:37:21,896
Victim to a hospital immediately.

1466
02:37:22,671 --> 02:37:23,968
Of course, it can be saved.

1467
02:37:24,339 --> 02:37:25,765

And save lives!

Inspect every home! Kill it

02:44:08,143 --> 02:44:11,078
Who's that?
Who Óndrazneste to touch Deva?

02:44:20,088 --> 02:44:22,249
None of you can

02:44:31,466 --> 02:44:32,660
Deva! Where are you?

1491

Must be a beast ... Deva.

Deva is innocent ...

1509

Jindal was he who pulled on me.

1510
02:49:57,892 --> 02:50:05,424
It was Saxena who called me
and I called the Delta Tower ...
