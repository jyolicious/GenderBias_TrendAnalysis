1
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,967
What is love?

2
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:46,013
Love? ...Love is life.

3
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,014
Love? What is love?

4
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:52,178
Where does it happen? Why does
it happen? And how does it happen?

5
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:57,156
l believe that God predetermined
all our emotional relationships.

6
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,987
But then HE left it to
us to find each other.

7
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,120
HE made us all couples...

8
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,222
''and for every one of us,
there is a life companion.''

9
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,134
A soulmate? What nonsense! l
don't believe in all this...

10
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:15,267
''l'm absolutely sure that somewhere,
someone was made for me...''

11
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,210
and that someday l
shall certainly meet him.

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,944
''Okay, but will someone please tell me
how will l know who was made for me?''

13
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:28,045
''l mean, will she be wandering about
with a placard with my name on it?''

14
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:31,250
''When l see her, will
there be a clap of thunder...''

15
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:34,055
and a flash of lightning?
How will l recognise her?

16
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:38,121
''l don't know what others will do,
but l will recognise him.''

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,065
HE will speak to me...

18
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,263
''HE will give me a sign, and my
heart will realise that this is him.''

19
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,103
What is all this?
- This is love

20
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,234
Love!

21
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:04,086
''However far apart they may be...''

22
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:08,094
''Their paths will meet,
whatever happens,...''

23
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:13,293
''When two people are
made for each other''

24
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:17,098
''Made for each other''

25
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:32,380
The Heart ls Crazy

26
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:46,991
''Like the heart and its beat...
- Made for each other''

27
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:53,563
''Like the eye and its sight...
- Made for each other''

28
00:02:54,642 --> 00:03:00,239
''Like the monsoon and the rain...
- Made for each other''

29
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:06,719
''Like man and woman...
- Made for each other''

30
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:13,351
''Made for each other''

31
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,171
''When God made a heart,...''

32
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,372
''HE split it in two...''

33
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:37,417
''and gave them two names...''

34
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:40,612
''Radha and Krishna''

35
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,384
''Now the hearts beat...''

36
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:47,291
''they part, and they unite...''

37
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,524
''for, they are made for each other''

38
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,090
''Made for each other''

39
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,280
''l don't know when...''

40
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,623
''like a silent thief...''

41
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:31,495
''the first look of love...''

42
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,263
''stole my heart away''

43
00:06:53,414 --> 00:07:00,718
''ln love's very first
game of hide-n-seek...''

44
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:22,606
''l hid myself in the
shelter of his eyes''

45
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:27,374
''Now l'm frightened...''

46
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,714
''because like a silent thief,...''

47
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,619
''the first look of love...''

48
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,386
''stole my heart away''

49
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:25,701
''My hair disheveled, l
walk like l'm drunk''

50
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:48,694
''lf l am caught, l'll be questioned''

51
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,493
''Oh, how can l go home?''

52
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,401
''For, love's first sight...''

53
00:08:57,471 --> 00:09:00,702
''slithered and sneaked in...''

54
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:04,369
''and stole my heart away''

55
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,501
''Jimmy, get Rahul.
- Rahul's not here.''

56
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,447
''lt's time for him to appear.
Find him, fast!''

57
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,507
Oh God! l'll be right back.

58
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,523
''Shruti, you found Rahul?
- No.''

59
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,469
''l don't know when...''

60
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:08,565
''like a silent thief...''

61
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:28,754
''the first glance of love...''

62
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:32,492
''took my heart away''

63
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,584
''Yes, very good. Keep it up, everyone''

64
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:09,535
Rahul! How often have l told you
that l get anxious when you're late...

65
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,629
l got this idea at the last minute.
And l thought that if l shoot out...

66
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:15,834
''of the stage, the audience will
freak out, and that's what happened.''

67
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,639
''What's the fuss all about?
- Look Rahul, l'm fed up...''

68
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,646
''with your last minute entries.
- Hey kid, l'm the director.''

69
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:23,615
''l do what l want. l can
change whomever l like, even you.''

70
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,778
''Yeah, but you'll never
get another dancer like me.''

71
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,822
lf l want l can get Shruti to dance.
- Shut up!

72
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,554
Nisha! Fight with him later. lt's
time to go on stage. Take the mike.

73
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,654
''What? Okay, let's get the lights.''

74
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,823
ldiot!

75
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,579
Thank you... thank you very much

76
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:03,589
l want to thank you all very much...

77
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:08,094
for making this dance show such
a big success. Thank you so much

78
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:11,927
''As you all know, this is
the last night of this show.''

79
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,561
''However, l promise you that
we'll be back in three months...''

80
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:25,066
''with a new story, new
songs and a new name... Maya.''

81
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,707
''Yes, 'Maya' is the name
of our new dance show.''

82
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,912
''Thank you very much everybody,
and good night to you.''

83
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,054
Cheers!

84
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:54,733
''Rahul, this new play 'Maya'...
what's it all about? Tell us.''

85
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,709
''Get up! Tell us about it.
- Okay, okay.''

86
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,945
l don't know.
- What?!

87
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,752
''lf you didn't know that, then
why did you tell everyone...''

88
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,759
that we'll do a new
show called 'Maya'...

89
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:16,955
''and that we'll do it in three months?
- Now look, even l don't know...''

90
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,760
who or what Maya is. But l do
know that in three months...

91
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,733
we'll do a show called 'Maya'.

92
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,966
Do you have in mind a
girl who's like Maya?

93
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,669
''Not in mind, as of now
l can just feel her.''

94
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,876
Nisha! l've got a girl in mind.

95
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,977
''Rahul! aren't you talking
about Pami, the Colonel's daughter?''

96
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:47,083
''Rahul, is Maya the
girl you are in love with?''

97
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,652
''No, l'm not in love with
anyone but lots of girls love me.''

98
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:56,259
But Maya is the kind of
girl that anyone would love.

99
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,798
Maya is the kind of girl for
whom you would leave even Soni.

100
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,903
''You dare not cheat on my sister!
- Ballu, shut up.''

101
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:12,680
What does she do?
- She invades my dreams.

102
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,813
ls Maya beautiful?

103
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:19,984
Very.

104
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:26,726
This Maya must do something...

105
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,828
''Maya dances,... but only for herself.''

106
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,845
''Excuse me, but she is a feeling,
a fantasy, beautiful,...''

107
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,041
and a dancer. But we've got
to find her in three months.

108
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,174
So who is she?

109
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,812
Maya is all these things
and yet she is only Maya.

110
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:52,757
We've gone around in circles
and we're back where we started.

111
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,851
Are you trying to make us look dumb?

112
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,098
l've done chores all my life!
But l'll decide this today!

113
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,801
''Good morning, aunty!
- Silly girl! Where were you?''

114
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:46,107
l was outside.
- Now you have to come with me.

115
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,808
l'm tired of the promises
your uncle makes everyday.

116
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:53,819
''So, today we're going to have a
fight and you have to take my side.''

117
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,081
Okay! Let's go.

118
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,225
''Bravo, bravo!''

119
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,959
''Bravo, bravo! What a performance!''

120
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:44,162
''Panditji,... excuse me, Panditji''

121
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,933
''Go on, Chandni.... er, Shanti''

122
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,840
Please allow us to have a teabreak.

123
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,935
Break whatever you want.

124
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:58,041
Please allow me to have a
word with your students.

125
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,949
By all means.

126
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,113
Watchman! Gardener!

127
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:08,457
''Shankar and Ramu, if you don't mind,
perhaps you'd all get back to work!''

128
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,962
Where are you going?
- Thank you.

129
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,192
Why are you driving away my audience?
- Please be quiet.

130
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,895
You gather the servants here so
they can't get on with their work!

131
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,029
l have to do it all by myself.

132
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,006
''As of today, no music recitals.
From today...''

133
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:25,203
only you will sing and only
you will listen. No audience.

134
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:29,908
Even in my own house my
songs aren't appreciated.

135
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,178
So how will others appreciate them?

136
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:36,484
''Because of your aunt's behavior,
l never became a great singer.''

137
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,959
''l know, l know...
Now have a cup of tea.''

138
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,995
''No, l don't want any tea.
- Oh come on, uncle.''

139
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:47,022
Have a cup of tea...
and sing a song for me.

140
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,899
Will you listen to my song?
- Of course.

141
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,029
Really?
- Certainly.

142
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,006
So let me have the tea!

143
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,203
Parcel for you.

144
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,042
lt's from Ajay!
Should be his cassette.

145
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,015
''Hear my song first.
- Later, uncle... please!''

146
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:08,213
See that? You have always
driven away my audience!

147
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,916
What are you dreaming about?

148
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,256
l was thinking how fast time flies.

149
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,060
lt seems like yesterday
that Mr. Khanna and Geeta...

150
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:23,159
had that accident and
Pooja came to our house.

151
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:28,196
''And now, it seems as if we
have no existence without her.''

152
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,266
And l have never seen such
close friends as Pooja and Ajay.

153
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,040
''Hey, fatty! How are you?''

154
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,240
''Shut up, l'm not fat.''

155
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,079
l've heard that nowadays you're
really packing your food away.

156
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:41,279
Don't do that or no
one will marry you!

157
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,982
ldiot! Don't worry about my marriage!
Who's going to marry you?

158
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:47,618
''By now, you must have finished
cursing me. So l'll proceed.''

159
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,993
''l'm having fun, as usual, and
work and girls are keeping me busy.''

160
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:54,295
Tell you what? l never
realised how handsome l am.

161
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:59,998
Don't make faces. lf you wish l
can fax you a list of my girlfriends.

162
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:03,099
''No, thank you.
- For your information...''

163
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:05,303
l've left Tina because she
doesn't like Hindi films.

164
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,073
Thank God. She was really stupid..

165
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,081
And now my heart is elsewhere...
- Who is she?

166
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,084
''Don't yell, l'm telling you.
She's called Dolly.''

167
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,316
There's no need to worry.
She really likes Hindi movies.

168
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,017
''Wow!
- Oh, l forgot.''

169
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:21,083
l may be coming to
Bombay for a few days.

170
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,322
When?!
- No need to stand. Sit down.

171
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,990
''lt's not fixed as yet. As soon
as l get to know, l'll tell you.''

172
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,125
''Okay, l'm off. Dolly is coming and
even though you haven't told me...''

173
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,033
l'll give her your love.
- There's no need.

174
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,096
''Okay, l won't... Hey! Here she comes!''

175
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,233
''Okay, l'm going. Give mum
and dad my love! Take care, bye''

176
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:47,343
''Hi! Hey Nisha, where've you put
that cassette you took from my car?''

177
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,014
You know there was a really
important track on it of our play.

178
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,149
Anything that goes into
your room vanishes forever.

179
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,320
Where the hell is the cassette?
- Rahul...

180
00:19:56,396 --> 00:20:01,265
you have no manners. You must
knock before coming into a girl's room.

181
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,268
ls there a girl here?

182
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,167
''l am! Stop it, Rahul! l'm serious!''

183
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,071
''Look, don't talk to me in
this girly girly way. Please!''

184
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,166
You have also entered my
room when l had nothing on. So?

185
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,371
''That's different.
- Why? My honour's not honour, eh?''

186
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,209
''Shut up, Rahul...
- You shut up!''

187
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,182
''Go on now,... get my cassette.''

188
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,655
''First say sorry, then
you'll get the cassette.''

189
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,157
Must l say sorry ?!
- Yes.

190
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,421
Say sorry to you ?
- Yes.

191
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,191
''l'll fix you, Nisha!''

192
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,165
Don't play stupid games with me!
- You stupid!

193
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,601
''lf l catch you, you're dead!
- l'm not giving it to you!''

194
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:43,198
''Come on, give me back my cassette!''

195
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,369
Give it to me!
- l won't!

196
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:48,175
''Give it to me, l say!
- Okay, okay.''

197
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,217
Now say you're sorry!
- Sorry for what?

198
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,218
Sorry that you've wasted
my time and made me run.

199
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,186
''l'm not saying sorry.
- You won't, eh?''

200
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,416
l'm sorry!
- Say you'll never annoy me again!

201
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,219
l'll never annoy you.
- Say: Rahul is the best.

202
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,384
Never!

203
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,190
Rahul is the best. Okay?
- l know. Thank you very much.

204
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,233
''Rahul is the worst! Rahul
is a dog, Rahul is a monkey!''

205
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,428
Whatever happens l
shan't dance in your play!

206
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,233
So be it. There are
plenty of dancers like you!

207
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:16,332
There's no one who dances like me!

208
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,231
My wedding has been fixed.
- Wedding?!

209
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,431
l'm sorry.

210
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:58,280
''What's wrong with you, Anjali?
You're going to marry someone...''

211
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:02,481
you haven't chosen?
Someone you hardly know?!

212
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:05,456
l do know him. He's
the son of Mr. Kapoor.

213
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:09,825
l've known him for years.
- But you don't love him.

214
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:15,266
''Well, Pooja,... love
will happen in due course.''

215
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:21,205
''Love happen in due course?
What are you saying, Anjali?''

216
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:22,468
''We're not kids anymore, Pooja.''

217
00:22:24,544 --> 00:22:27,206
lt's time we emerged
from our world of fantasies.

218
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,510
We are lndian girls.

219
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:35,179
The lovers of our dreams and
our husbands are not the same.

220
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:40,214
Someone else chooses
our husbands for us.

221
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:43,524
We learn to love them.

222
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:48,431
''This is the truth and the
sooner you realise it, the better.''

223
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,300
''Don't make this mistake, Anjali.''

224
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:59,903
''Someone, somewhere is made for
you and you should wait for him.''

225
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,304
Perhaps he is the one.

226
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,251
l believe that this is the
one who was made for me.

227
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:11,222
And l'm going to live
through with this belief.

228
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,226
And who knows? This
might happen to you.

229
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:22,256
Tomorrow you might marry a
man whom you merely know...

230
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:27,932
and slowly you might realise that
he was the one you were waiting for.

231
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:36,243
Nothing like this will happen to me.
l'll choose my husband myself.

232
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:41,252
''This is impossible, Rahul.
There can't be a girl like this.''

233
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,482
Meaning?
- lt's a meaningless character.

234
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:49,290
Maya exists only in your dreams.
Modern girls aren't like this.

235
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,592
What do you know? You're not a girl.

236
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,394
''Stop it, Rahul. l'm serious.
Modern girls...''

237
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,595
Maya is not one of these
modern girls. She's different.

238
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,366
She is my Maya.

239
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,410
''Your Maya, indeed! What
do you know about girls?''

240
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:07,605
You know only one. And that's me!

241
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,409
What do you mean? l don't
know anything about love...

242
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,507
and yet l make love stories.
What of it?

243
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,520
''Rahul, your Maya is really crazy.''

244
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,422
Don't you call my Maya crazy! And
you are the only one who feels this.

245
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,619
Nobody else is saying anything.
- Definitely!

246
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,390
''Rahul, l think Nisha is right.
- Thank you.''

247
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:29,333
l don't understand 'Maya' either.
Her character seems false.

248
00:24:32,405 --> 00:24:35,431
Looking at it from a
psychological point of view...

249
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,443
l'm sure that you're on your own trip.

250
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,603
On a fantasy trip.

251
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,409
''l'm sorry, Maya is not in.''

252
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:47,647
Do you also want to say something?
- l think we need a lunchbreak.

253
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,449
Exactly! See?
- l don't know...

254
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:52,582
if such a girl exists or not...
and l don't want to know.

255
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:56,458
''Whether she is a lie, a
fantasy or mad or whatever...''

256
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,622
That is Maya.

257
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:03,362
''lf you cannot understand this,
l'm very sorry, l can't help it.''

258
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:09,671
But under no circumstances am l
going to change the character of Maya.

259
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,473
Excuse me.
- What's this!

260
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,411
l think Rahul's right.

261
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:19,474
You shut up. You are Rahul's yes-man.
- l was only saying that....

262
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,486
Okay... what were you saying?
Do you know of such a girl?

263
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,681
ls your Soni like this?
- No.

264
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,485
You figure the character of Maya?
- No.

265
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,355
Should we do this play ?
- Never.

266
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,486
''That's exactly what l've been saying!
- Right, but...''

267
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,360
Not again!

268
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,469
''That innocent face''

269
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,708
''The mischief in her eyes''

270
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:51,841
''Oh my!''

271
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,519
''That innocent beauty,
with mischief in her eyes...''

272
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:03,494
''stands afar shying away''

273
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,691
''Oh my!''

274
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:11,430
''For a fleeting moment she
shows herself and then turns away''

275
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:20,468
''lf you look with my eyes, friend,
you can see her''

276
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,597
''She's no ordinary girl,
she's a wonder''

277
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,802
''How else can l describe her?''

278
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:31,543
''Last night l dreamt of her...
her hair flowing wildly''

279
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:38,522
''When l woke up, l wished l
could go back to my dream''

280
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,617
''lf this how l feel
without meeting her,...''

281
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,821
''what will happen when l do?''

282
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:53,830
''Dark as the monsoon
clouds is the kohl in her eyes''

283
00:28:55,901 --> 00:29:00,634
''Her gait has the grace
of the waves in the ocean''

284
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:06,906
''Wonder what HE used
to create her body''

285
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,008
''l wish she appears
before me out of nowhere''

286
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,750
''Rahul, how do you
like this? Hold this.''

287
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:55,760
Perhaps you haven't noticed
but everyone is staring at us.

288
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,956
So what? l don't care.
- But l'm looking funny.

289
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,761
Oh come on. How do
you like the orange?

290
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,768
Very nice...
- l'll be back in a moment.

291
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,833
Shopping?
- Yes.

292
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,970
Alone?
- Yes.

293
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:17,743
Very good! Never make the
mistake of going shopping with a girl.

294
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,788
''How d'you like it? Cool, isn't it?
- You like it?''

295
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:24,755
l like it very much.
- l love it! Let's go.

296
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,918
Once you've tried it on.
- Both of us like it... let's go.

297
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,086
To hell with Rahul!

298
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,858
So sweet!
- What did you say?

299
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,763
''Nothing, nothing at all. Off you go!''

300
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,931
Who is it?
- Aw... sorry!

301
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,159
Okay? Happy?

302
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,866
Why are you laughing? What's up?
- Where are your jeans?

303
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,033
l'm wearing it...

304
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,173
lt happens.

305
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:01,844
Who's there?

306
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,002
Crazy!

307
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,877
Happy birthday to you.

308
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,975
Happy birthday to you.

309
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,782
Happy birthday to you.

310
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:41,917
Everybody clap... Open the cake box.

311
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,899
How did this happen?

312
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,903
What happened and when did it happen?

313
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:55,930
How did this get swapped over?
l had ordered a chocolate cake.

314
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:01,844
You picked up someone else's parcel.
- l'm so stupid! l should've checked.

315
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:05,816
''l'm sorry, uncle.
- lt's all right, dear.''

316
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,944
Other people celebrate their
birthdays by cutting a cake.

317
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:12,149
l'll celebrate mine by
cutting sandwiches. No big deal.

318
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,919
Let me see who got my cake.

319
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,090
Who's this Pooja?
- l don't know.

320
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,065
And who's this uncle?
- Must be Pooja's uncle.

321
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:24,966
''First time l sent you out, and you
end up picking the wrong parcel.''

322
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:28,063
What have l done? l brought the
parcel the shopkeeper gave me.

323
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,973
But you should have checked.
- Excuse me...

324
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:34,137
''but it wasn't up to me to check.
Next time, do it yourself.''

325
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,977
l am hungry. This
cake looks really good.

326
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,950
Stop it. No one's eating this cake.
- Why not?

327
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,045
Because it belongs to someone else.
- They must be eating our sandwiches.

328
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,990
There's an address written here.
lt's nearby. Go and deliver it.

329
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,151
Are you mad?

330
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:52,891
''This is someone's birthday cake,
ordered with love.''

331
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:54,956
Someone's party will be ruined.
Go and give it back.

332
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,160
l'm not going.

333
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,294
Damn Rahul!

334
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,964
''Jimmy, let's go and give it
back and say 'Happy Birthday!'.''

335
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,974
So sweet!
- What did you say?

336
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,168
Nothing.

337
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,301
Yes?

338
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:15,979
''Good evening. Are you uncle?
- No, l'm aunty.''

339
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:20,082
''Actually, by mistake l
got your cake, aunty.''

340
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,990
The sandwich man!
- That's right.

341
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,224
Here's your cake...
wishing you a happy birthday.

342
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,094
Thank you and sorry.

343
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:32,001
Why sorry?
- Because l've eaten your sandwiches.

344
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:37,236
''That's all right. Actually, l ate
a bit of your cake on the way here.''

345
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,367
No wonder...!

346
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:43,074
''Okay, l'll be off Uncle.
- No. Come in and have some cake.''

347
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,013
No thanks. l'm in a hurry.
Some other time.

348
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,245
''Just a minute. Just
one minute, please.''

349
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:50,049
''Let the person who
bought this cake, thank you.''

350
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,022
''There's no need.
- No, no!''

351
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,065
''That poor man, whose
sandwiches you picked up by mistake...''

352
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:03,260
has brought the cake back.
- How sweet!

353
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,030
He's at the door. Go and thank him.

354
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:10,974
The cake has brought a
twinkle in my eyes...

355
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:16,276
and a musical rhythm to
the strings of my heart.

356
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,051
Strange man.

357
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,216
Why are you buying all these stuff?

358
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:03,159
''Oh, Anjali... Today is Valentine's Day''

359
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:07,995
What is this 'Valentine's day'?
- Don't you know?

360
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:12,230
The man you love most in the
world is called your Valentine.

361
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:16,400
''On this day, all lovers let
their hearts out to each other.''

362
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,103
This is all about love.
You won't understand.

363
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,147
Very funny! But whom are you
buying all these things for?

364
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:24,341
For myself.
- What?

365
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:29,012
''You see, l don't have a lover
who'd buy me all these lovely things.''

366
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,250
l'm doing this for my own pleasure.
- You've gone quite mad.

367
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:36,123
''Do you know, today isn't
an ordinary Valentine's Day.''

368
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:40,154
lt falls on the same day as the
full moon. Know what this means?

369
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:43,133
''l don't, but l'm sure
you're going to tell me.''

370
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:47,366
''lt means that, if you believe
that someone is made for you...''

371
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,169
''and you are waiting for
him with a true heart,...''

372
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:54,269
you will certainly meet him today.
- And you really believe this?

373
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,314
Of course. l'm absolutely sure...

374
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:00,078
that before midnight l
shall meet my soulmate.

375
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:04,384
Pooja! You're really mad!
- That l am.

376
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,173
''Damn Rahul! l'm going home. lf you
want to come with me, then come on.''

377
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,306
''Rahul, we all came together
and we'll all go together.''

378
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:33,044
''This is a very boring party. lf
you want to come, then come on.''

379
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,416
''Rahul, you don't get any better.''

380
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:40,083
''Look, how beautiful is the night...
and you're so unromantic.''

381
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:47,462
''Look, everyone's so much in love.''

382
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,229
You think that they're all in love?

383
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:53,203
Of course.
- Sit down.

384
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:59,335
''Tell me something, Nisha. You
think you know what love is?''

385
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:04,246
''Love is when you're so fond of
someone, that your heart tells you...''

386
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:08,446
you want to spend the whole
of your life in his arms.

387
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,149
That's what we call love.
- l see. You think the people here...

388
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,250
want to spend the rest of
their lives with each other?

389
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:19,388
l think so.
- Girls are so daft.

390
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:23,264
''Do you know, most of these
romances will be over before tomorrow?''

391
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,463
They'll fight over small things...

392
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:30,440
and will never see
each other after tonight.

393
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,273
''And next year, you will
see the same faces,...''

394
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,472
at the same places in different arms.

395
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:38,175
''Boys are also really stupid.
- l'm telling you the facts, Nisha.''

396
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:42,186
You must realise that you need
to know someone really well...

397
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:45,485
to spend your life together.
- That's right.

398
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:48,390
And in order to know someone well
you need to spend time together?

399
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,191
''True.
- ln today's times, who has the time?''

400
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:55,290
''Look; among all these party guests,
no one's known each other...''

401
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,494
for as long as we've known each other.

402
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,368
Does that mean that we can
spend a lifetime with each other?

403
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:06,207
Let me put it this way. Will you
be able to spend a lifetime with me?

404
00:39:06,278 --> 00:39:10,510
''Here you are, Rahul. And
everyone wants you outside!''

405
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:13,312
Why?
- Everyone wants a song from you.

406
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,512
''Oh no...
- Oh, come on!''

407
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,356
''Tell me, will you be able
to spend a lifetime with me?''

408
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,296
''Yes Rahul, l can.''

409
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,393
l could spend my whole life with you.

410
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:29,358
''The moon whispered something...''

411
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:33,592
''which the night heard...''

412
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:41,435
''The moon whispered something,
which the night heard''

413
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,371
''Did you hear,...''

414
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:47,401
''lt said, fall in love''

415
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:50,573
''Fall in love''

416
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:55,279
''The moonlight came...''

417
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,384
''to my street and to
my house, to say...''

418
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,396
''fall in love''

419
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,443
''What can l say, what can l do?''

420
00:41:53,512 --> 00:42:01,442
''This strange thing
that has happened to me''

421
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,685
''lt is a sign or did
my heart whisper...''

422
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,498
''fall in love''

423
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:25,467
''l can't explain, but l am
certain that there is someone''

424
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:30,804
''He is somewhere in my dreams,
but l cannot see him''

425
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:36,643
''l am here... he is somewhere there''

426
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,551
''But who is this who says...''

427
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:48,787
''Fall in love''

428
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:42,209
''l could die for him,
yet he is oblivious''

429
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:58,558
''But l can't complain. l
cannot call him unfaithful''

430
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:04,568
''l can hear him... even
though he is yet to speak''

431
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:06,627
''O my heart, be careful...''

432
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:11,574
''when you fall in love''

433
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:30,915
Hello?
- Are you mad?

434
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,753
Are you out of your mind? How
can you return just like that?

435
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:36,953
You said we had come together
and we'd all leave together.

436
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,758
Then you run away all on your own.
You know that we're all worried.

437
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:40,923
ldiot! Stupid! Fool!

438
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:42,057
Hello?

439
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:48,834
''This is not 6 7 1 1 2 3 7, is it?''

440
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:50,738
No.
- l thought so.

441
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:53,972
''l'm sorry, l thought
it was someone else.''

442
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,910
You're right. l am someone else.

443
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,642
l'm really sorry. Please excuse me.

444
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:01,776
''lt's okay.
- Thank you... hang on, one minute.''

445
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:03,980
''Don't hang up, please.
- Yes?''

446
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:06,751
The music you're playing...

447
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:09,988
''that's Pundit Shiv Kumar
Sharma's new album, isn't it?''

448
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,927
Yes.
- l thought so.

449
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:16,023
''You know, l wanted to buy it.
Where did you buy it from?''

450
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,762
From Rhythm House.
- l haven't been there.

451
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:23,001
D'you think they'd have it in stock?
- How would l know?

452
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:26,703
''l'm so stupid. How would you know?
You don't work there, right?''

453
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:29,770
l'm really sorry about all this.

454
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:30,974
lt's okay.
- Good night

455
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,778
Good night.
- l'm really very sorry

456
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,012
lt's okay.
- Happy Valentine.

457
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:37,782
Happy Valentine.

458
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,793
Nice voice.

459
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,917
''Ajay, you idiot!''

460
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:50,148
How dare you do this to me?
You scared the hell out of me!

461
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:53,054
Now l'm not going to give
up until l've got you. Stop!

462
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:25,213
How about it?

463
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,375
Cut it!

464
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:57,910
''Ballu! What are you up to?
- Why, what's wrong, Rahul?''

465
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:01,015
The spotlight should move from me to
Nisha after the drum roll. l told you

466
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:02,992
And l thought...
- Shut up.

467
00:51:03,061 --> 00:51:07,020
''Come on, Nisha... do it again.
Let's take it from the top''

468
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:08,998
Rahul...
- Damn Rahul! What is it?

469
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:13,094
Please pack up early today.
- Why? What's special about today?

470
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:16,902
''Nothing. Come on.
- C'mon, let's take it from the top.''

471
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:20,000
''Rahul, you forgot?
Today is her birthday.''

472
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,103
Really? Why didn't someone tell me?

473
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:27,015
''Nisha, what's wrong with you?
Why didn't you tell me?''

474
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:32,352
''There are some things, Rahul,
which one knows without being told.''

475
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,051
Even then... you people
should have said something.

476
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:38,061
''Honestly, you guys are the limit...''

477
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:40,029
Rahul! Just relax!
- l'm very angry.

478
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,263
You've been forgetting all these
years. This is just another year.

479
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:50,205
Stop putting on an act and take
us all out to dinner. Come on.

480
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,037
''Come on guys, let's go.
- Nisha...''

481
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,238
What is it?

482
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:57,372
Happy birthday.

483
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,044
You remembered...?
Why didn't you say it?

484
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,089
There are some things which
one knows without being told.

485
00:52:05,156 --> 00:52:08,057
''You idiot! Thank you.
- lt's okay, Nisha.''

486
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,253
Let's rehearse!

487
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,160
''Just joking. Come on, everybody.''

488
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:27,074
''Okay everybody, Tequila time!''

489
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,051
What are you guys drinking?
- Tequila.

490
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,316
l want some.
- This isn't for ladies. Have Pepsi.

491
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,688
''No, l want some.
- l told you! This is not for you!''

492
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,990
Today's my birthday.
- Happy birthday.

493
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:48,122
Thank you. l'll do as l please.

494
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,327
''Okay, suit yourself.
Give me another glass.''

495
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:54,098
So sweet.
- What...?

496
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,298
Nothing.

497
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,103
You're in love? Give over!

498
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:01,475
l know your kind of love.
lt changes every week.

499
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:05,346
''This is your kind of love, not mine.
- You mean, the marrying kind?''

500
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:10,046
Really? Who's the girl? Do l know her?

501
00:53:10,121 --> 00:53:13,352
''Really well.
- Tell me who she is, please!''

502
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:18,486
Must l?
- Shoot!

503
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:21,623
Forget it.

504
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:23,124
That hurt!

505
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:27,069
Okay! One... two... three... go!

506
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:37,137
Didn't l tell you?
lt's not for ladies!

507
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,342
One more!

508
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,477
Damn you!

509
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,182
''Please, Ajay! Tell me who she is!''

510
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:50,386
Right then. We'll do this.
See that waiter?

511
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:53,157
Which one?
- The one serving water.

512
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:58,191
Keep looking at him. lf there's
still a glass of water on that tray...

513
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,399
by the time he gets to our
table then l'll tell you her name.

514
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:04,532
Promise?
- Promise.

515
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:05,633
Okay.

516
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,416
''Oh my God! Excuse me! A
glass of water, please!''

517
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,218
That's cheating. You can't do that.

518
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,418
Everything is fair in love and war.

519
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:25,223
Thank you!
- Everything is fair in love and war.

520
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:27,389
You idiot!

521
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:30,195
Nisha please... Nisha!

522
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:35,398
''Nisha, shut up!''

523
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,205
Shut up now... hush.

524
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:49,151
Don't say anything.
Say nothing at all...

525
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:53,816
''Take my shoes and give me money.
- Please... go to sleep, Nisha.''

526
00:54:56,894 --> 00:54:58,225
Go to sleep. Good night.

527
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:10,240
''l'm afraid, Rahul.
Don't leave me l'm scared''

528
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:12,401
lt's really late. Now
quietly go to sleep! Good night!

529
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,208
First promise me
that you won't leave me.

530
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,249
''Okay, baby, l shan't leave you alone.''

531
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,186
''You won't leave me, even if l
ask for an ice-cream, will you?''

532
00:55:25,256 --> 00:55:26,314
''No, l won't.''

533
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:31,191
''You won't leave me, even if l
don't dance well... will you?''

534
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,253
''No, l won't.''

535
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:38,200
''Not even if l call you names...
donkey, monkey... will you?''

536
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,260
''Of course, l won't.''

537
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:47,505
''You won't leave me, even if l tell
you that l love you... will you?''

538
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,638
''l love you, Rahul.''

539
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,275
''l really love you, Rahul.''

540
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:04,487
l love you.

541
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:31,248
There she is... still asleep!

542
00:56:31,322 --> 00:56:34,348
''Come on, Pooja! lt's
seven in the morning!''

543
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,326
''The sun is up, Pooja.''

544
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,537
What the hell...!

545
00:56:56,614 --> 00:57:00,277
You...? You idiot! ls this
the way to wake someone up?

546
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:04,378
''l'm so sorry, but seeing you fast
asleep, l just couldn't resist it!''

547
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:07,583
How could l miss out
on such an opportunity?

548
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,353
''You idiot! Stupid!
- l'm sorry... sorry, sorry''

549
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:14,489
''Listen, get ready quickly.
We've got to go to the airport.''

550
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:16,590
Airport? Are you going somewhere?

551
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:20,398
No. We are going somewhere.

552
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:24,373
''We? And where are we going?
- Well, that's a surprise.''

553
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:27,411
''lt's not far from lndia,
it's very near.''

554
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,378
We'll return by tonight's flight.
Get ready quickly!

555
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:34,282
l can't figure. What are you saying!
- Silly! lt's very simple.

556
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:38,412
l have to go on some business.
lt will take me just an hour...

557
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:40,616
just sign some
papers and then l am free.

558
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:44,422
''lf you come along, you'll see a
new city as well as do some shopping.''

559
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:48,329
And anyway l am leaving for London
tomorrow. That leaves only today...

560
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:51,391
which l want to spend
with you. So simple.

561
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:54,438
''But Ajay, l must find out if
it's okay with Uncle and Aunty.''

562
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:58,441
l've already got their approval.
lt's only you who has to decide!

563
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:03,640
''So fatty, are you coming or not?
- Of course, l'm coming!''

564
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,409
Then hurry up and get ready.
The flight is on time.

565
00:58:05,483 --> 00:58:07,644
Wait a minute....
What's that under your eye?

566
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:08,776
Where...?

567
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:11,412
''Now wait, you fatty...!''

568
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,653
Never mind. l'll get you for this.
- Come and get me.

569
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,723
''You're going shopping,
aren't you? We'll see!''

570
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:48,883
''The heart is crazy, the heart is mad''

571
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,690
''The heart is crazy, the heart is mad''

572
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:01,499
''The very first time lovers meet...''

573
00:59:02,573 --> 00:59:05,508
''it sets their bodies on fire''

574
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:10,673
''Very slowly it teaches love...''

575
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:14,377
''it makes them laugh,
and it makes them cry''

576
00:59:14,451 --> 00:59:19,081
''The heart is crazy, the heart is mad''

577
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:27,426
''lt keeps them awake all night...''

578
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:31,593
''it steals the sleep from their eyes''

579
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,731
''lt shows true and false dreams,...''

580
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:40,436
''it makes them laugh,
and it makes them cry''

581
00:59:40,511 --> 00:59:42,536
''Those who follow the heart...''

582
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:44,740
''are known to be crazy''

583
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:32,591
''They discover their destination...''

584
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:41,503
''but cannot find the path''

585
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:03,185
''l don't need to see his face...''

586
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,526
''l don't need to know his name either''

587
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,535
''l don't need to think or worry...''

588
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:16,835
''because my heart will know him''

589
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:21,699
''We all listen to
what the heart says,...''

590
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:25,902
''the heart doesn't listen to anyone''

591
01:02:26,977 --> 01:02:30,606
''l've given my life to him...''

592
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:34,708
''yet everyone knows, but he''

593
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,601
''So be it, give up these stories...''

594
01:02:56,673 --> 01:02:59,733
''and all these signs of madness''

595
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:04,747
''All people's worries are...''

596
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:08,751
''all thanks to this crazy heart''

597
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:22,882
''Well, Ajay sahib,...
it's time for you to go.''

598
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,986
Now l have to go.
- Did you say something?

599
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:32,763
''Pooja, l want to tell you something.
- Tell me. What is it?''

600
01:04:32,836 --> 01:04:37,739
This quick business trip of a
couple of days was all a pretence.

601
01:04:37,808 --> 01:04:42,040
l came here for something else.

602
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,946
lt's been eight
years since l left lndia.

603
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:51,749
''l've earned enough of respect,
money ... life has been too hectic.''

604
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:54,848
l want to settle down now.

605
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,862
And whenever l close my eyes...

606
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:03,058
to think whom l would like to
spend the rest of my life with...

607
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,830
it is always your face that l see.

608
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:15,937
l don't know how or when my
feelings for you turned to love.

609
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:22,281
But l don't know
anything about your mind.

610
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:24,843
Or if there is anyone
in your life or not.

611
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:27,982
That is what l came here to find out.

612
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:29,992
l don't know what you think about me.

613
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:39,901
l don't even know if you would
want to spend your whole life with me.

614
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:47,103
But l know for sure that l
love you and l want to marry you.

615
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,883
l'm going towards the departure gate.

616
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:04,018
Once l've got there
l'll turn round and look.

617
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:10,362
''lf your answer is yes,
then you'll be standing here.''

618
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:15,337
And if you're not here
then l'll understand.

619
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:24,142
''And one more thing. Don't forget
that whatever your decision is,...''

620
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:28,947
''we were friends, we are friends,
and we'll always be friends. Okay?''

621
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:47,936
''And who knows, tomorrow
it may also happen to you.''

622
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:52,169
Perhaps you will marry a
man whom you only know ...

623
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:53,800
but whom you don't love.

624
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:58,041
Then you will realise
later that he was the man...

625
01:06:58,115 --> 01:06:59,946
for whom you were waiting.

626
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:31,071
What? But why did you
keep standing there ?

627
01:07:32,149 --> 01:07:36,017
Sometimes l'm so happy when
l make someone else happy...

628
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:38,247
that l can't think of anything else.

629
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:42,223
''You should have seen his face,
Anjali! He was so happy.''

630
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:43,987
l have never seen him
so happy ever before.

631
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:49,465
''And your happiness? You
don't love him, Pooja!''

632
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:56,234
Love? Love will happen in due course.

633
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:03,940
And we are lndian girls. We
can't choose our life partners.

634
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:10,043
Someone else chooses
our life partners for us.

635
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:14,250
We learn to love them.
lsn't that true ?

636
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,260
At last you have left your
girlish dreams and become a woman.

637
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:21,957
''No, Anjali. The girl
has become a woman,...''

638
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:26,025
but she has not given up her dreams.

639
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:29,038
''She believes in them completely,
even now.''

640
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:37,206
She is sure that Ajay is the one
for whom she was always waiting.

641
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,978
''Perhaps, it was HE who was
taking His time to show her.''

642
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:46,284
l'm certain that Ajay
will make you very happy.

643
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:47,414
l hope so.

644
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:10,980
''What happened, Nisha? Take
her to the doctor, hurry!''

645
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:13,072
''Slow down, Rahul. We're almost there.''

646
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:18,280
Get a stretcher.

647
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:25,089
''Hi, doctor...
- There's no need to worry.''

648
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:28,131
lt's a small fracture.
She'll go home in a week or so.

649
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,224
l told you Nisha would
start dancing again in a week.

650
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:35,135
''l'm talking about going home,
not dancing. She can't dance...''

651
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:38,333
for another three months.
- Three months...?

652
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:41,138
''Yes, Rahul. Her
heel is very delicate.''

653
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:45,341
lf she doesn't take care then
this fracture could recur...

654
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:48,145
and it could be more serious.

655
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:51,153
Does she know this. May l see her?

656
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:53,348
Of course. You don't
need my permission.

657
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,118
''Thank you, doctor. l'll see you guys.''

658
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:58,127
Whose going to get me a cup of tea ?

659
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:04,224
God! You won't learn to knock.

660
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:07,031
Don't give me a lecture. l have
something very important to discuss.

661
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:12,233
''Yes, tell me.
- Can you see me properly?''

662
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:14,140
''How many fingers?
- Stop it, Rahul.''

663
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:18,170
''Okay! See, your Doctor Kapoor
isn't up to much, in my opinion...''

664
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:22,378
Get a check-up with another doctor.
- Why?

665
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:24,181
This doctor was talking about
getting you discharged in a week.

666
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:27,314
''So what?
- No, it's not done.''

667
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,187
lt's been difficult getting
you admitted into a hospital.

668
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,386
You should spend at
least a month or two in here.

669
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:35,124
''And while you are away,
we'll also have some peace.''

670
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,190
''Rahul, l hate you! You're so horrible!''

671
01:10:38,268 --> 01:10:40,168
You're always making fun of me.
l hate you. You're so bad!

672
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:43,400
''Nisha, behave yourself. Sorry,
nurse. She has gone mad with the pain.''

673
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:46,203
''But don't worry, l'll take
care of her. l'm a psychologist.''

674
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:48,403
Yes?
- l'm sorry.

675
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:50,170
For what?

676
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:54,342
l've put you to so much of trouble.

677
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:58,114
You've taken all the
money from the sponsor...

678
01:10:58,188 --> 01:11:01,419
and how will you get
a dancer so quickly?

679
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,187
''And for three months, l....
- Now look...''

680
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:07,230
there's no need for you to worry.

681
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:11,233
Damn Rahul! Why do you think?
You're a good dancer?

682
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,428
ln this town there
are many such dancers.

683
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:17,234
''Sure, but you'll never get...
- A dancer like you, right?''

684
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:20,299
Right.
- Now you don't worry about this.

685
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:24,438
You have a nice rest and l'll
come see you in the evening.

686
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:29,451
l'll bring some food. We'll
eat together. lt's a deal.

687
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,318
Bye.
- Bye.

688
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:38,452
''l know. Chinese, right?
- Right.''

689
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:45,262
Not to worry. lt will all work out.
- How will it all work out?

690
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:48,463
We've taken money from the sponsors
and paid a deposit for the stadium.

691
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:50,267
''And most of all, where will we
get another dancer like Nisha?''

692
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,275
''Come on, if we try, don't you
think we can find one good dancer?''

693
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:57,177
There are plenty of dance schools.
One is close to our rehearsal hall.

694
01:11:57,247 --> 01:12:00,478
''We'll find a dancer there tomorrow.
- Yes, yes!''

695
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:04,179
''You're right. How about that,
Rahul? Come on! Relax!''

696
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:08,486
Whatever happens will be for the
best. Let's go and have some cold beer.

697
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:11,288
''You go ahead. l'm not in the mood.
- Come on, buddy!''

698
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:14,296
''Lay off, he's tired.
Come on, let's go.''

699
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:17,492
Take care.
- Let's go.

700
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:26,201
Maya... l'll find her.

701
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:40,724
''Water, water...''

702
01:16:49,497 --> 01:16:51,158
Excuse me...

703
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:54,157
The sandwich man!

704
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,760
Shanti... has a parcel
come here by mistake?

705
01:16:56,837 --> 01:17:00,170
l haven't come for a parcel today.
- Then tell me what l can do for you.

706
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:03,438
l want to meet your daughter.
- l don't have a daughter.

707
01:17:03,511 --> 01:17:05,172
No daughter?
- No.

708
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,646
''Then sir, this Miss
Pooja Malhotra...?''

709
01:17:07,782 --> 01:17:13,186
Pooja is like my daughter.
But how do you know her?

710
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:16,189
l saw her last night.
- Night...?

711
01:17:17,458 --> 01:17:19,790
Where?
- ln the dancing school.

712
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:22,192
She dances beautifully.
- And so?

713
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,525
''So, l wanted to meet her.
- What for?''

714
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:27,390
l want to ask her something.
- What do you want to ask her?

715
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:30,801
''Sort of, would she, with me...
- With you... what?''

716
01:17:31,806 --> 01:17:35,207
lf she wanted to work with me.
- What work?

717
01:17:35,476 --> 01:17:39,207
l do plays. l'm looking for a dancer
- You are doing a play.

718
01:17:39,347 --> 01:17:40,473
Yes.

719
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:44,214
Are you a director?
- Yes. l am sorry.

720
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,810
l am sorry! Why
didn't you tell me before?

721
01:17:46,887 --> 01:17:50,220
''l said so, when you asked me.
- l am sorry. Come on.''

722
01:17:50,891 --> 01:17:53,223
''Actually, l am a singer.
- l see.''

723
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:56,229
l've done years of practice. Sit.

724
01:17:56,564 --> 01:18:00,295
''As it happens with
many great artistes,...''

725
01:18:00,368 --> 01:18:02,563
you really don't
meet many connoisseurs.

726
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:07,232
You've met me today. You
don't know how lucky you are!

727
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,776
''l know, sir, but l
have come to meet Pooja.''

728
01:18:09,844 --> 01:18:12,506
''Now that you have met me,
you will meet Pooja, too!''

729
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:18,246
''l won't give you more than 75 bucks.
- 80 bucks, no less.''

730
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,255
Only last week l
bought it at that price.

731
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:25,850
This is the right price.
Taste it and see how sweet it is.

732
01:18:25,926 --> 01:18:28,258
l will give you only seventy-five.

733
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:31,264
''Show me the watermelon.
- Here you are, sir.''

734
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:37,868
''Seventy-five is the right price.
How many do you want, Madam?''

735
01:18:37,938 --> 01:18:39,872
Just one.
- Pack this for Madam.

736
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:41,874
But...
- Oh come on!

737
01:18:41,942 --> 01:18:44,809
lt's your first sale in the day.
And you're haggling for 5 bucks!

738
01:18:44,879 --> 01:18:46,278
Be a sport!

739
01:18:50,885 --> 01:18:53,285
Hi.
- Hi.

740
01:18:53,621 --> 01:18:59,287
Recognise me? We met last night
at your dancing school. Remember?

741
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,487
''Oh yes.
- l'm, Rahul''

742
01:19:01,629 --> 01:19:04,564
You must've heard of me?
- No.

743
01:19:04,832 --> 01:19:09,895
''Well, never mind. Actually
you are a pretty good dancer.''

744
01:19:11,972 --> 01:19:16,636
''Actually, l'm doing some music
shows and l need a special dancer...''

745
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:21,306
for a special role. When l
saw you dancing yesterday...

746
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:24,647
l thought that you
would be ideal for this.

747
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,447
So what do you think?
Would you be interested?

748
01:19:30,658 --> 01:19:33,991
''No, thanks.
- l've had it!''

749
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:38,331
''Sir, watermelon!
- Dammit! My career's at stake!''

750
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:42,801
''Excuse me, but perhaps
you misunderstand me.''

751
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,668
l'm talking to you
about no ordinary show.

752
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:50,343
lt's a very high-class show
with a very high-class audience...

753
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:54,347
and l am sure you will also enjoy
doing it. Why don't you try it once?

754
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:56,679
''Not for me, for the sake of art.''

755
01:19:57,017 --> 01:20:00,350
Dancing is my hobby.
- That's really good.

756
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:03,822
But l am afraid of dancing on
stage in front of an audience.

757
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:06,359
Why are you afraid?
- l don't think l can do it.

758
01:20:06,694 --> 01:20:09,356
l'm sorry.
- No... problem.

759
01:20:14,702 --> 01:20:16,829
Excuse me... l'm sorry.

760
01:20:16,904 --> 01:20:19,839
''You see, l'm really in difficulty.
Actually, my lead dancer...''

761
01:20:19,907 --> 01:20:22,375
has fractured her foot. l've already
taken all the money for the show.

762
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:24,377
''lf we don't perform, l'll suffer
monetarily, l'll also lose face.''

763
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:29,382
''Come just once for a rehearsal,
and if you don't like it, it's fine.''

764
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,975
''But please, just once.
Please come to the rehearsal.''

765
01:20:32,052 --> 01:20:35,715
l'm really very sorry. l can't do it.

766
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:39,915
''You'll have to take someone else.
- l beg of you, please!''

767
01:20:39,994 --> 01:20:42,656
What are you up to?!
- You don't know me. l'm stubborn.

768
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:45,995
l'll not go until you agree.
Please come just once to a rehearsal.

769
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:49,399
''Everyone's looking at us.
- Please... please come, just once!''

770
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,664
l'll come.
- Promise?

771
01:20:50,738 --> 01:20:52,672
Promise.
- When? What time ?

772
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:54,401
Two O'clock.
- Can you come at one ?

773
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:58,411
''Okay, l'll come at one.
- Thank you very much!''

774
01:20:59,013 --> 01:21:02,005
''You know that we are neighbors,
don't you?''

775
01:21:02,082 --> 01:21:06,416
l know.
- Thank you very much!

776
01:21:09,089 --> 01:21:12,422
''Ma'am! You'll come, won't you Ma'am?''

777
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:16,429
''Yes, you will!''

778
01:21:20,434 --> 01:21:21,560
Yes?

779
01:21:23,037 --> 01:21:24,436
For you.

780
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,704
He's mad!

781
01:21:46,727 --> 01:21:50,128
''Rahul, you said that girl
would come at one o'clock...''

782
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:53,064
lt's four now. l
don't think she'll come.

783
01:21:53,133 --> 01:21:56,000
''So what should l do? So if she
doesn't come, won't we do our play?''

784
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:58,470
l was only...
- Go and get on with your own thing.

785
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,473
''Okay, relax.''

786
01:22:15,155 --> 01:22:18,147
''Ballu, put the
spotlight on the entrance.''

787
01:22:37,845 --> 01:22:40,507
Hi.
- Hi.

788
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,579
You must've heard of me?

789
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,198
''Cut it! No, no!''

790
01:23:07,741 --> 01:23:14,010
''No Pooja, no! You are
not dancing with abandon.''

791
01:23:14,214 --> 01:23:17,809
You are concentrating
more on the steps and music.

792
01:23:18,886 --> 01:23:22,822
l don't want to see
how well you dance.

793
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,687
l have already seen that
and you are very good.

794
01:23:25,159 --> 01:23:29,152
l want to see whether
you are Maya or not.

795
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:33,830
l want to see the extent of
Maya's love and abandonment.

796
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:39,163
l want to see what happens
when Maya dances wholeheartedly.

797
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,901
Right? We'll try it once more.

798
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,582
''All right, music!''

799
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:04,858
Cut it!

800
01:24:04,932 --> 01:24:07,594
Why don't you understand
what l'm trying to tell you?

801
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:10,728
Forget that anyone's sitting here.
Forget that the music is playing.

802
01:24:10,804 --> 01:24:13,796
Forget that this is a rehearsal.
Just think of Maya.

803
01:24:13,874 --> 01:24:20,609
l don't want to see you dance.
l want to see your madness!

804
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:22,672
Maya's madness...

805
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:28,620
''l'm sorry, Pooja.
- Don't touch me.''

806
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:32,884
''l'm really sorry, Pooja. l was just...''

807
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,224
Never in my life has anyone
spoken to me in such a way.

808
01:24:35,295 --> 01:24:40,164
''l know, Pooja... but l'm an idiot.
l don't know how to talk to girls.''

809
01:24:40,234 --> 01:24:42,828
''l told you, l can't do it.''

810
01:24:42,903 --> 01:24:46,634
But you're doing it really well.
l am going on about this Maya.

811
01:24:46,707 --> 01:24:48,698
l don't understand this Maya.
- Never mind...

812
01:24:48,776 --> 01:24:51,301
l don't want to do this.
- Don't worry if you don't understand.

813
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:54,905
We don't have to do this today.
We can do it tomorrow. Okay?

814
01:24:54,982 --> 01:24:58,247
l don't want to do it
tomorrow either. - Okay.

815
01:24:58,318 --> 01:25:00,650
''Maya, relax.
- My name is Pooja!''

816
01:25:00,988 --> 01:25:02,979
''Of course, it's Pooja.''

817
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:06,659
''l'm sorry... sit down, please.''

818
01:25:06,994 --> 01:25:10,657
''l'm really sorry... Pooja, if you
don't want to dance, then don't.''

819
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:13,791
But please stop crying.
Don't want water? No problem.

820
01:25:13,867 --> 01:25:16,665
''You see Pooja, it's my way
to yell during rehearsals.''

821
01:25:16,804 --> 01:25:19,136
l wasn't having a go at you.

822
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:24,006
l was only trying to
explain to you about Maya.

823
01:25:24,945 --> 01:25:29,348
''Pooja, perhaps you
didn't understand Maya.''

824
01:25:31,285 --> 01:25:39,021
Maya is the kind of girl
who lives in a dream world.

825
01:25:40,027 --> 01:25:47,024
She believes that one day her dream
prince will come and carry her away.

826
01:25:47,835 --> 01:25:51,293
Her friends have
always made fun of her...

827
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:53,032
but that did not shake her belief.

828
01:25:54,775 --> 01:26:00,714
''And today, she has met
the man of her dreams...''

829
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,373
and she is dancing.

830
01:26:03,183 --> 01:26:08,382
There is intense love in her dance
and madness and a certain arrogance.

831
01:26:09,056 --> 01:26:19,398
''As if to say, ''l knew he would
come and now, see, he has come''

832
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:23,269
''My dream man has come''

833
01:26:50,898 --> 01:26:52,024
Music!

834
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:43,145
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant

835
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:47,081
''Nisha, l can't believe we got
such a good girl so quickly.''

836
01:27:47,154 --> 01:27:52,091
''Had l not got the right girl for this
role, l'd have cancelled the play...''

837
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:54,957
''given back the money, and
willingly faced the music.''

838
01:27:55,495 --> 01:27:58,157
But l was destined to meet Pooja.

839
01:27:59,499 --> 01:28:02,093
''Her name is Pooja?
- No, it's Jeetendra.''

840
01:28:02,169 --> 01:28:03,830
Of course it's Pooja.

841
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,966
ls she beautiful?
- Really beautiful.

842
01:28:09,176 --> 01:28:12,839
Remember how l used to
describe Maya? She's just like her.

843
01:28:13,046 --> 01:28:18,382
''That innocent face, those
dreamy eyes and that bashfulness.''

844
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,184
''She is too good,
Nisha, she is brilliant!''

845
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:27,456
ls she a good dancer?
- When she dances...

846
01:28:27,527 --> 01:28:29,859
you can only keep
looking at her. l know that...

847
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,865
you will go crazy when you see her.
- l see.

848
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,862
But can she act?

849
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:39,872
''What? Of course, she can. lf
she can't act, what am l for?''

850
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,341
lf l can get you to act
l can get anyone to act.

851
01:28:43,410 --> 01:28:44,877
Very funny.

852
01:28:45,012 --> 01:28:48,209
''There's no water, no soft drink...
and you've called me for dinner.''

853
01:28:48,482 --> 01:28:50,882
Wait a minute and l'll bring some.

854
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:58,890
ls she as good a dancer as me?

855
01:28:59,559 --> 01:29:03,893
Are you crazy? There's no
dancer as good as you. Right.

856
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,158
Right.

857
01:29:10,437 --> 01:29:14,430
ldiot. Can't even lie properly.

858
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,604
Torn!

859
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:03,012
The stitch...

860
01:31:34,714 --> 01:31:37,046
''May l say something, Pooja?
- What?''

861
01:31:37,384 --> 01:31:41,047
''When you laugh, you know...
- l know that l look good.''

862
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:47,389
When you laugh it starts to rain.

863
01:31:56,736 --> 01:32:01,070
''With the gait of a horse,
with the majesty of an elephant''

864
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:05,077
''O King of the Rains,
where are you from?''

865
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:53,456
''l know a girl, when
she smiles,... it rains''

866
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:19,819
''l know a boy, when
he sings, it rains''

867
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,458
''The clouds have descended...''

868
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:09,195
''They have blocked our path''

869
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:13,205
''Tell us what your intentions are...''

870
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:17,209
''will you not let us go home?''

871
01:34:17,544 --> 01:34:21,537
''There's rain ahead, a storm behind''

872
01:34:21,881 --> 01:34:26,215
''The weather is treacherous...
Oh, where can we go?''

873
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:32,546
''The sky has lowered...''

874
01:35:32,619 --> 01:35:37,283
''Everything has come to a standstill''

875
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:41,293
''How lovely is this season of shadows''

876
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:45,297
''Take it as the sign of the times''

877
01:35:45,632 --> 01:35:49,568
''ln such a weather, say something...''

878
01:35:49,636 --> 01:35:54,300
''...do something! Why
do you stand silent?''

879
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:55,424
The doctor has said clearly that
you can't go out of the house.

880
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:58,430
There's no need for you to
strain yourself trying to get up.

881
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:01,433
Now settle down quietly.

882
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:05,096
Whom are you phoning
the minute you've got here?

883
01:38:05,972 --> 01:38:11,706
''Oh yes, he called to say
that he's at Soni's house.''

884
01:38:11,778 --> 01:38:15,441
''At Soni's? Oh yes, today's
Soni and Jimmy's engagement.''

885
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:18,712
''Aunty, get my clothes out quickly.
l want to go there.''

886
01:38:18,785 --> 01:38:21,583
''Look, l'll phone the doctor.
- Aunt, please!''

887
01:38:21,654 --> 01:38:23,121
She just won't listen!

888
01:38:46,145 --> 01:38:50,479
l hate these weddings. l don't
understand why people get married.

889
01:38:50,683 --> 01:38:55,017
lf two people have decided to
spend their whole lives together...

890
01:38:55,088 --> 01:38:58,956
why are the others making such a
fuss? Why are all they getting excited?

891
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:01,888
These days it has become fashionable
to have seven days of ceremonies...

892
01:39:01,961 --> 01:39:04,759
''and merriment at weddings.
Forget it, buddy.''

893
01:39:05,098 --> 01:39:07,828
''Get married, have a quiet
ceremony and then go home and sleep.''

894
01:39:08,101 --> 01:39:10,695
l've even come to hate
the word 'marriage'.

895
01:39:10,837 --> 01:39:12,498
''Excuse me, may l have another?''

896
01:39:12,705 --> 01:39:15,503
But the one good thing is
that in all this fuss...

897
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,510
you get lots of goodies
to eat. Have you eaten?

898
01:39:18,578 --> 01:39:19,977
Later.
- Let's sit.

899
01:39:20,113 --> 01:39:21,580
l really love weddings.

900
01:39:21,848 --> 01:39:25,841
''The different small ceremonies,
dancing, singing, and making merry...''

901
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,512
they're what l love.
- Very good.

902
01:39:29,188 --> 01:39:31,520
l'm going to have all
of them at my wedding.

903
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,526
Are you getting married?

904
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:37,858
Yes.

905
01:39:42,602 --> 01:39:47,539
Why didn't you tell me?
When are you going to do it?

906
01:39:48,074 --> 01:39:52,534
''Actually, nothing's
fixed yet. He works abroad.''

907
01:39:52,879 --> 01:39:54,540
When he comes back then...

908
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:57,674
we'll fix a date when
we've found an auspicious time.

909
01:39:58,217 --> 01:40:00,549
That's why l haven't
mentioned this to anyone.

910
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:03,549
l see. Congratulations.

911
01:40:04,624 --> 01:40:05,750
Thanks.

912
01:40:10,163 --> 01:40:13,564
''Rahul, when's your wedding with Nisha?''

913
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,568
Nisha and me? Have you gone mad?

914
01:40:16,703 --> 01:40:20,161
The two of us are just good
friends and there's no chance of us...

915
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,231
''ever getting married and in any
case marriage and me, no thank you.''

916
01:40:23,576 --> 01:40:27,103
''Actually, l don't believe at
all in these wedding ceremonies.''

917
01:40:27,246 --> 01:40:31,580
l don't know how a person decides to
spend his whole life with another.

918
01:40:31,651 --> 01:40:34,586
l fail to understand
and l'm certain...

919
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:39,114
There can't be a girl who
could spend her whole life with me!

920
01:40:39,258 --> 01:40:42,591
You're mistaken in your thinking.
There is such a girl.

921
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:45,927
Where is she?
- Somewhere or the other.

922
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:48,929
Rubbish!

923
01:40:50,803 --> 01:40:55,604
''l believe that in the beginning,
God made all the relationships.''

924
01:40:55,942 --> 01:40:58,206
But then HE left it to
us to find each other.

925
01:40:58,878 --> 01:41:01,608
HE created us all as couples.

926
01:41:01,948 --> 01:41:04,610
For every one of there is a soulmate.

927
01:41:05,218 --> 01:41:07,686
You just have to
wait till you meet her.

928
01:41:08,821 --> 01:41:11,881
Do you think this is true?

929
01:41:11,958 --> 01:41:13,892
This is the truest thing in my life.

930
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:16,821
True!

931
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:23,635
That means that you
have met your soulmate.

932
01:41:24,904 --> 01:41:29,637
Yes. l have met him.

933
01:41:37,116 --> 01:41:39,641
Something's amiss.
- What?

934
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:43,652
The ice cream's good. Have some.
- No.

935
01:41:52,331 --> 01:41:55,266
Nisha! When were you
discharged from the hospital?

936
01:41:55,334 --> 01:41:57,928
l ran away from hospital.
- Great! Jimmy and Soni...

937
01:41:58,004 --> 01:41:59,938
will be delighted to see you.
- Where are they?

938
01:42:00,006 --> 01:42:04,670
''Over there, go and meet them.
- Rahul is there, isn't he?''

939
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,678
Rahul's gone to drop Pooja home.

940
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:21,222
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

941
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:27,693
lt's that story you
told me at Soni's.

942
01:42:28,034 --> 01:42:30,969
''That some special girl is
made for me... etc, etc...''

943
01:42:31,304 --> 01:42:33,033
l've been thinking about that.

944
01:42:34,307 --> 01:42:37,299
l didn't understand something.
- What?

945
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:42,714
How will l know who's made for me?

946
01:42:43,049 --> 01:42:46,177
You have such faith in this
theory that you must know...

947
01:42:46,252 --> 01:42:48,243
how l am going to
meet this girl also.

948
01:42:48,387 --> 01:42:53,051
''l mean, will she be wandering
about with a board with my name on it?''

949
01:42:53,259 --> 01:42:56,990
''Or, when l see her will there be a clap
of thunder and a bolt of lightning?''

950
01:42:57,063 --> 01:42:58,724
Or will music start to play?
What will happen ?

951
01:43:00,066 --> 01:43:03,729
''HE will tell you, HE
will give a sign...''

952
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:07,068
and your heart will
realise who the girl is.

953
01:47:25,331 --> 01:47:27,993
l've even reasoned with her...
but she doesn't listen.

954
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:31,002
She does what she wants.
- Hi doctor.

955
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:35,006
''Rahul, it's good that you came.
This girl has worried me.''

956
01:47:35,074 --> 01:47:37,474
Why? What happened?
- l told her clearly that...

957
01:47:37,543 --> 01:47:42,276
''she needs to stay at home to rest.
But you see, she's packing her bags...''

958
01:47:42,348 --> 01:47:45,010
and getting ready to go somewhere.
- Where to?

959
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:49,282
How would l know? l've tried my best
to explain. She doesn't listen to me.

960
01:47:49,355 --> 01:47:52,017
''Well, only you can convince her.''

961
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:55,618
''Don't worry, she won't go anywhere.
l'll just go and twist her ear.''

962
01:47:55,694 --> 01:47:58,356
Best of luck. See you.
- Bye

963
01:48:03,636 --> 01:48:06,628
''What are you doing,
Nisha? Have you gone mad?''

964
01:48:06,705 --> 01:48:10,163
''The doctor told you to rest, right?
By the way, where are you off to?''

965
01:48:10,242 --> 01:48:12,369
l'm going to London.
- London?

966
01:48:12,578 --> 01:48:15,308
''Well, Mum and Dad keep phoning
me asking me to go to see them.''

967
01:48:15,381 --> 01:48:17,645
Months have gone by.

968
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:23,048
''l think l'll go to see them.
Besides, l want to run away from here.''

969
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:25,181
Want to run away...? From whom?

970
01:48:26,725 --> 01:48:29,660
''From myself.
- What's all this nonsense, Nisha?''

971
01:48:31,197 --> 01:48:33,597
''l've begun to get
scared of myself, Rahul.''

972
01:48:35,534 --> 01:48:40,597
''l want to go, to avoid committing
mistakes, like l did one yesterday.''

973
01:48:40,673 --> 01:48:43,073
''Nisha, you haven't
done anything of the sort.''

974
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:46,407
You only danced. Look here...
- Rahul...

975
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:50,073
now we should stop playing
hide and seek with each other.

976
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:54,608
We both know what the problem is.

977
01:48:55,421 --> 01:48:57,082
What's the problem?

978
01:48:59,425 --> 01:49:07,093
The problem is that l love
you and you don't love me.

979
01:49:11,303 --> 01:49:14,101
''Look here, Nisha...
- l know...''

980
01:49:14,440 --> 01:49:19,104
that you know how much l love you.

981
01:49:20,446 --> 01:49:23,108
That night l wasn't so out of it...

982
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:26,117
that l couldn't hear
what my heart was saying.

983
01:49:27,319 --> 01:49:33,121
''Actually, Rahul, we have
become such good friends...''

984
01:49:33,192 --> 01:49:36,127
that we take each other for granted.

985
01:49:37,196 --> 01:49:43,135
So l think that a bit of
space will give us time to think.

986
01:49:45,137 --> 01:49:52,134
''But l am sure that when l'm not here,
you'll remember me often.''

987
01:49:52,811 --> 01:49:55,609
Then perhaps you will
start caring for me.

988
01:49:55,814 --> 01:50:00,148
''One thing is certain,
that an idiot like you...''

989
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:02,619
doesn't deserve a girl like me.

990
01:50:03,756 --> 01:50:10,161
''And l don't why, but l
feel that when l come back,...''

991
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:16,168
you will be on your knees
begging me to get married to you.

992
01:50:16,502 --> 01:50:19,164
And who knows at that point...
l may not want to marry you.

993
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,174
''Well, perhaps you
haven't seen your face...''

994
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:24,641
lt's better than yours.

995
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:40,191
Nisha...

996
01:50:40,259 --> 01:50:42,193
you're really nice.

997
01:50:43,329 --> 01:50:47,197
''l know. Come on now, l got say bye to
everyone before going to the airport.''

998
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,218
''Come on, Rahul, hurry up.''

999
01:51:12,825 --> 01:51:15,350
We haven't been properly introduced.

1000
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:19,429
Let's start from the beginning.
Hi! l'm Nisha.

1001
01:51:19,498 --> 01:51:20,760
l'm Pooja.

1002
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:28,229
''Now that we are friends, will you
forgive me for what l did yesterday?''

1003
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:30,502
Forgive you? For what?

1004
01:51:30,843 --> 01:51:35,576
''Pooja, what l did with
you yesterday, wasn't right.''

1005
01:51:36,382 --> 01:51:39,579
''Actually, ever since
this place was built,...''

1006
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:42,583
l'm the only one who's
danced on this floor.

1007
01:51:43,322 --> 01:51:45,722
This floor has become my trademark.

1008
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:50,728
So when l heard that someone
else was dancing in my place...

1009
01:51:51,397 --> 01:51:53,262
l felt bad.

1010
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:56,864
''Without seeing you or
knowing you, l felt jealous.''

1011
01:51:57,603 --> 01:51:59,594
l shouldn't have felt that way.

1012
01:52:00,272 --> 01:52:03,264
''Had l been in your place, then
perhaps l'd have done the same.''

1013
01:52:03,609 --> 01:52:07,272
''Moreover, l really
enjoyed dancing with you.''

1014
01:52:07,613 --> 01:52:12,277
You were the one dancing.
l was doing something else.

1015
01:52:13,485 --> 01:52:15,817
l am really sorry.
- lt's okay

1016
01:52:15,888 --> 01:52:18,288
''Come on, Nisha, it's
time for your flight.''

1017
01:52:18,424 --> 01:52:23,293
l always told Rahul that there
could never be another dancer like me.

1018
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:25,296
But l can't say that anymore.

1019
01:52:25,631 --> 01:52:30,625
And l'm sure that no one can perform
the role of Maya better than you.

1020
01:52:30,702 --> 01:52:33,569
''Not even me. All the best,
bye. See you.''

1021
01:52:33,639 --> 01:52:34,833
Bye.

1022
01:53:32,498 --> 01:53:36,366
Hi. l'm Rahul.
Perhaps you've heard of me?

1023
01:53:36,702 --> 01:53:38,693
l'm looking for a special
dancer for a special role.

1024
01:53:39,037 --> 01:53:43,701
l saw you dance yesterday and
felt you would be ideal for this.

1025
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:47,708
''Check, check... 69...''

1026
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:50,380
''Ballu, what are you doing?
Angle the spotlight properly.''

1027
01:53:51,517 --> 01:53:55,385
''Pooja, good, good. But...''

1028
01:53:56,655 --> 01:53:59,852
l think that you
aren't dancing freely.

1029
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:03,724
l want to see how Maya
looks when she's happy.

1030
01:54:03,996 --> 01:54:08,399
l want to see the extent of
Maya's madness and love. Okay?

1031
01:54:08,534 --> 01:54:10,001
Do it again. Okay!

1032
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:14,730
Quiet everybody. Take it from the top!

1033
01:54:15,407 --> 01:54:16,533
Music!

1034
01:54:17,409 --> 01:54:18,933
Cut it! Cut it!

1035
01:54:19,077 --> 01:54:21,409
''Haven't l told you to forget
that you are you, to forget that..''

1036
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:24,745
people are sitting here. Forget that
there's a rehearsal going on here.

1037
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:26,010
Pack up!

1038
01:54:29,021 --> 01:54:31,421
''One thing l don't understand, Pooja.''

1039
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:35,423
''How l will know which girl
was made for me? l mean,...''

1040
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:38,429
will she be wandering about
with a board with my name on it?

1041
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:42,433
''When l see her, will there be a clap
of thunder and a flash of lightning?''

1042
01:56:28,874 --> 01:56:35,074
''Oh dear, what's happening?
l don't really know''

1043
01:56:35,147 --> 01:56:41,552
''l only hope this does
not turn into a romance''

1044
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:47,820
''Oh dear, what's happening?
Nobody really knows''

1045
01:56:48,093 --> 01:56:54,555
''But if this is a romance,
then so be it''

1046
01:57:42,948 --> 01:57:48,614
''Take my hand in yours,
as long as you are here''

1047
01:57:49,287 --> 01:57:54,953
''Let us keep talking,
as long as we can''

1048
01:57:55,961 --> 01:57:58,896
''Let's sit here
looking at each other,...''

1049
01:57:58,964 --> 01:58:02,627
''as long as the night remains.''

1050
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:20,976
''What name can l give
this season of my heart''

1051
01:58:21,987 --> 01:58:27,653
''Even the dewdrops seem to burn,
with the fever of my heart''

1052
01:58:28,193 --> 01:58:34,655
''Why do l feel as if
someone has caressed me''

1053
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:35,123
''Please go away for a while,
so l can collect my feelings''

1054
01:59:36,061 --> 01:59:41,727
''And quieten the
violent beating of my heart''

1055
01:59:42,334 --> 01:59:48,739
''Let's slow down so that we
don't move ahead too fast''

1056
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:07,349
''There is something
between us, don't deny it''

1057
02:00:08,093 --> 02:00:14,760
''And if something further
happens have faith in your feelings''

1058
02:00:14,833 --> 02:00:21,033
''For you should know, your
heart is not what it was''

1059
02:00:21,106 --> 02:00:27,375
''Oh dear, what's happening?
- l don't really know''

1060
02:00:27,445 --> 02:00:33,782
''l only hope this does not...
- turn into a romance''

1061
02:00:33,852 --> 02:00:40,052
''Oh dear, what's happening?
- Nobody really knows''

1062
02:00:40,125 --> 02:00:46,792
''But if this is a romance...
- then so be it''

1063
02:01:16,161 --> 02:01:19,289
l hope your uncle will be asleep
so l won't have to hear him sing.

1064
02:01:21,900 --> 02:01:23,834
Bye.
- Bye

1065
02:01:25,971 --> 02:01:28,838
''Rahul, l forgot to tell you...
- What?''

1066
02:01:28,907 --> 02:01:31,307
l can't attend rehearsal tomorrow.
- Why?

1067
02:01:31,443 --> 02:01:34,435
Tomorrow l'm going to Khandala.
- Khandala? Why ?

1068
02:01:34,512 --> 02:01:36,980
My teacher lives there.
- Which teacher?

1069
02:01:37,182 --> 02:01:42,449
My dance teacher. She
taught me everything l know.

1070
02:01:42,854 --> 02:01:44,321
Tomorrow it's her birthday.

1071
02:01:45,123 --> 02:01:47,853
''lf l say no, will you not go?''

1072
02:01:49,194 --> 02:01:54,393
''l shall go, but if you
say yes, l'll go happily.''

1073
02:01:56,201 --> 02:01:59,398
l'm joking. Go on. l'll
rehearse with someone else tomorrow.

1074
02:01:59,537 --> 02:02:02,131
Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

1075
02:02:06,945 --> 02:02:08,879
l've had it.

1076
02:02:23,962 --> 02:02:25,953
Rahul...? What are you doing here?

1077
02:02:26,231 --> 02:02:29,223
l have a friend in Khandala.
He's been inviting me for ages...

1078
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,896
but l've never had a chance to go.
And since we can't work without you...

1079
02:02:33,972 --> 02:02:35,906
l thought l'll meet him
and give you a ride too.

1080
02:02:35,974 --> 02:02:38,374
You've no one with you so l
thought it'll be company for you.

1081
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:42,913
What are you staring at? Hurry up!
lf we go early we'll beat the traffic.

1082
02:02:43,515 --> 02:02:47,451
''Well, why are you smiling ?
- No reason.''

1083
02:02:47,585 --> 02:02:50,383
Let's go.
- Today l'm really missing my friend.

1084
02:03:09,274 --> 02:03:11,936
''Tommy, quiet! Quiet!''

1085
02:03:13,545 --> 02:03:19,541
They won't do anything.
l'll be right back. Stay here.

1086
02:03:19,617 --> 02:03:22,279
''Don't worry, they won't
bite you. l'll be back.''

1087
02:03:22,554 --> 02:03:24,954
Want some soft drink?

1088
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:40,971
''Sandhya, what are you doing?
l'll give you a good slap.''

1089
02:03:41,239 --> 02:03:43,969
''Glutton, you have become
so fat, you can hardly move.''

1090
02:03:44,309 --> 02:03:48,575
No chocolates or ice creams
for you. Get it right this time.

1091
02:03:51,049 --> 02:03:53,984
Move the neck. Arms straight.

1092
02:03:55,053 --> 02:03:57,988
Why are you laughing?
Close your mouth.

1093
02:03:58,256 --> 02:04:01,589
lf anyone gets it wrong then
no one will watch TV tonight.

1094
02:04:01,659 --> 02:04:04,992
''Don't come begging me again,
Please Tai ! Please Tai !''

1095
02:04:05,063 --> 02:04:09,329
Look! Here comes your dear Pooja!

1096
02:04:10,335 --> 02:04:13,998
''Tai, how did you recognise me?
- There's no need to act smart.''

1097
02:04:14,072 --> 02:04:16,597
l recognise all the girls
from the sound of their steps.

1098
02:04:17,075 --> 02:04:19,475
Happy Birthday to you!

1099
02:04:19,544 --> 02:04:22,274
What's this? You've
brought me another ugly sari.

1100
02:04:22,347 --> 02:04:25,009
''Yes, l chose the ugliest
l could get my hands on.''

1101
02:04:30,088 --> 02:04:34,024
Where you are going?
The class isn't over yet.

1102
02:04:34,092 --> 02:04:37,550
Now l'm here... the class is over.
- You're spoiling them rotten.

1103
02:04:37,695 --> 02:04:39,356
They behave well all through
the year. And the day you come...

1104
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:43,025
they start misbehaving.
- Sometimes one should be spoilt.

1105
02:04:53,378 --> 02:04:56,040
Tai! Wait!

1106
02:04:56,114 --> 02:04:59,311
Rahul is my friend.
- Your friend?

1107
02:04:59,717 --> 02:05:03,653
''Leave him, children.
- Go on, children... go inside!''

1108
02:05:05,123 --> 02:05:07,057
Why are you so frightened?

1109
02:05:08,726 --> 02:05:10,057
Happy Birthday!

1110
02:05:13,398 --> 02:05:16,390
What are you up to?!
- l'm trying to touch your feet.

1111
02:05:16,601 --> 02:05:20,059
''Do l look that old?
- No, but out of respect..''

1112
02:05:20,138 --> 02:05:22,072
Give me your hand...
- Pardon me?

1113
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:23,266
Your hand.

1114
02:05:24,142 --> 02:05:25,666
Nice to meet you!

1115
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:30,080
''Come on, you've caught a cold.
Come, let's go in.''

1116
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:33,083
Save me from the dogs.
- They won't hurt you.

1117
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:36,086
''Tai, who's he?''

1118
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:41,085
l don't know but l
will have to find out.

1119
02:05:46,698 --> 02:05:50,361
''Pooja, you didn't tell
me what Rahul does.''

1120
02:05:50,435 --> 02:05:54,701
Rahul...he directs plays.
Nowadays l'm working with him.

1121
02:05:54,772 --> 02:05:56,103
l see.

1122
02:05:58,176 --> 02:06:02,112
l think that you
don't like Rahul specially.

1123
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:05,115
''No, l like him very much.''

1124
02:06:05,183 --> 02:06:07,117
Very much?

1125
02:06:07,185 --> 02:06:12,122
''l mean, he's a good friend.''

1126
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:17,457
Good friend? You
mean you don't love him.

1127
02:06:17,662 --> 02:06:23,123
''Tai, Rahul's just a friend.
A dear friend.''

1128
02:06:24,469 --> 02:06:28,132
l see... a dear friend.

1129
02:06:28,473 --> 02:06:33,410
lt's not like you think and in any
case l wanted to tell you something.

1130
02:06:33,478 --> 02:06:37,141
There's no need to tell me.
l understand everything.

1131
02:06:37,215 --> 02:06:40,150
''Stop it, Tai. Tai,
you've got it wrong.''

1132
02:06:45,490 --> 02:06:48,482
''Rahul, what's up?''

1133
02:06:48,559 --> 02:06:51,824
Nothing. Why are you standing
with the spoon? Come join us.

1134
02:06:52,497 --> 02:06:55,159
Stupid!
- Hey everybody!

1135
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:59,430
''Come on everyone,
follow me... this way.''

1136
02:07:03,841 --> 02:07:06,173
''lf it's not love, then what is it?''

1137
02:07:07,512 --> 02:07:11,846
''Tai,... honestly!
- Look here, girl!''

1138
02:07:12,183 --> 02:07:15,175
l've known you since you
were twelve years old.

1139
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:20,787
''What your heart doesn't
let you know, it tells me.''

1140
02:07:21,859 --> 02:07:26,193
The look in your eyes says
that you love this boy very much.

1141
02:07:26,331 --> 02:07:30,529
Now stop lying to me... okay?

1142
02:07:30,868 --> 02:07:35,202
''Just a dear friend''... big deal!
- Listen, Tai...''

1143
02:07:47,285 --> 02:07:53,224
''l don't remember when this happened''

1144
02:07:53,825 --> 02:07:59,559
''lt's become hard to hide
this secret from everyone''

1145
02:08:00,565 --> 02:08:07,232
''lf you say so, today
l'll ask God for something''

1146
02:08:07,305 --> 02:08:13,244
''Oh dear, what's happening to you?
- Beats me''

1147
02:08:13,711 --> 02:08:20,241
''l just hope this doesn't turn...
- lnto a romance''

1148
02:08:42,607 --> 02:08:47,738
''l see, so when is Ajay coming back?''

1149
02:08:48,279 --> 02:08:51,271
Nothing is definite but
he could come at any time.

1150
02:09:04,362 --> 02:09:06,296
l'll be right back.

1151
02:09:23,448 --> 02:09:27,646
''Pooja, give me your hand.
- Why?''

1152
02:09:27,852 --> 02:09:30,446
l won't hit you! Give me your hand.

1153
02:09:34,659 --> 02:09:36,320
What's this?

1154
02:09:37,662 --> 02:09:40,995
Listen carefully to what
l'm going to tell you.

1155
02:09:41,666 --> 02:09:44,328
Ever since you were a child...

1156
02:09:44,402 --> 02:09:48,930
you have always
considered others before yourself.

1157
02:09:50,007 --> 02:09:53,670
l have always been
overwhelmed by your behavior.

1158
02:09:54,679 --> 02:09:59,343
But today you have made me sad.

1159
02:10:00,618 --> 02:10:02,347
But l...
- Quiet!

1160
02:10:02,687 --> 02:10:06,350
Sometimes it's very
important to consider ourselves.

1161
02:10:07,692 --> 02:10:12,356
l see that you are
running away from your dreams.

1162
02:10:12,697 --> 02:10:17,691
You won't let them
come true. Don't do this.

1163
02:10:18,703 --> 02:10:24,505
Not everybody is fortunate to
have their dreams come true.

1164
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:26,909
Don't do this.

1165
02:10:28,713 --> 02:10:32,979
''Tell you something, one
happens to fall in love many times.''

1166
02:10:34,452 --> 02:10:37,387
True love only happens once.

1167
02:10:41,058 --> 02:10:43,526
You are failing to
take the right step.

1168
02:10:44,729 --> 02:10:49,530
Lord Ganpati will help
you to do what is right.

1169
02:10:50,468 --> 02:10:56,600
HE will give you the
strength to fulfill your dreams.

1170
02:10:58,676 --> 02:11:03,409
''Keep lt with you,
always. l have faith in lt.''

1171
02:11:04,615 --> 02:11:08,676
''The Lord will set everything right.
- l love you, Tai.''

1172
02:11:11,756 --> 02:11:17,558
Stop it! l don't
make a habit of crying.

1173
02:11:31,509 --> 02:11:34,444
Why are you frightened?
- Pardon me?

1174
02:11:34,512 --> 02:11:36,912
Why are you frightened of
being in love? Tell her.

1175
02:11:37,114 --> 02:11:41,915
''Love and me? l was just...
- Okay, give me your hand.''

1176
02:11:42,587 --> 02:11:46,648
Nice to meet you.
- Take it!

1177
02:11:47,525 --> 02:11:49,789
''What's this?
- This is, in a way, my blessing.''

1178
02:11:50,061 --> 02:11:54,464
l'm very mean in this matter. l
don't give my blessing that easily.

1179
02:11:54,799 --> 02:11:58,997
But when l saw you l
thought that perhaps you need it.

1180
02:11:59,804 --> 02:12:04,002
This will help you to say
what you are unable to say...

1181
02:12:04,809 --> 02:12:06,606
Keep it very carefully.

1182
02:12:07,545 --> 02:12:09,945
You get it?
- Got.

1183
02:12:11,148 --> 02:12:14,481
''She is coming. lf you can't
say it, then l'll say it...''

1184
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:15,746
l'll say it.

1185
02:12:15,820 --> 02:12:18,015
Definitely?
- Definitely.

1186
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:27,622
Mark my words carefully.

1187
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,831
Bye!
- Bye

1188
02:12:37,908 --> 02:12:41,503
''Bye!
- Goodbye, sister!''

1189
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:08,539
''Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen...
May l have your attention, please?''

1190
02:13:08,673 --> 02:13:11,540
''Aunty, please... thank you.''

1191
02:13:14,745 --> 02:13:17,543
Since l am Jimmy's best man...

1192
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:21,073
l have the right to make a speech...

1193
02:13:21,152 --> 02:13:26,146
and you all have to listen to it.

1194
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:30,559
''Until today, l didn't understand
how two people can take a vow...''

1195
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:33,688
to spend their entire
lives with each other.

1196
02:13:34,699 --> 02:13:38,100
l didn't believe in
these vows of marriage.

1197
02:13:38,235 --> 02:13:43,764
And seeing Jimmy and Soni together
only strengthened my conviction.

1198
02:13:44,241 --> 02:13:47,574
Because there can't be
anyone as innocent as Soni...

1199
02:13:47,645 --> 02:13:51,103
and there can't be a
scamp to beat Jimmy.

1200
02:13:52,249 --> 02:13:55,912
l used to worry that Soni
and Jimmy are too different...

1201
02:13:55,986 --> 02:13:59,114
to spend their lives together.

1202
02:14:00,925 --> 02:14:05,919
But today l realise that l was wrong.

1203
02:14:07,665 --> 02:14:13,729
l am a little ashamed to admit
that l have started believing in love.

1204
02:14:15,673 --> 02:14:21,942
''The kind of love in which
lips don't speak, eyes do.''

1205
02:14:23,681 --> 02:14:28,812
The kind of love that binds
two people together forever.

1206
02:14:30,955 --> 02:14:33,947
''And today, l keep
thinking of just one thing.''

1207
02:14:34,692 --> 02:14:40,961
l remember something a
very dear friend said:...

1208
02:14:41,031 --> 02:14:45,627
that God predetermined all
our emotional relationships...

1209
02:14:45,703 --> 02:14:50,902
but then HE left it to
us to find each other.

1210
02:14:51,108 --> 02:14:54,635
HE made us all couples and for
every one of us somewhere...

1211
02:14:54,712 --> 02:14:58,307
there is just one soulmate.

1212
02:14:58,983 --> 02:15:01,850
HE made Soni for Jimmy.

1213
02:15:02,653 --> 02:15:08,649
Today l thank God for
getting Jimmy and Soni together...

1214
02:15:08,726 --> 02:15:14,665
and l pray that HE may give
each one of us the ability...

1215
02:15:14,732 --> 02:15:19,669
to recognise our own soulmate.

1216
02:15:26,277 --> 02:15:27,676
Thanks.

1217
02:16:09,787 --> 02:16:11,721
''Rahul, you are strange.''

1218
02:16:11,789 --> 02:16:14,724
Soni and Jimmy have made their
farewells and you're still here.

1219
02:16:16,060 --> 02:16:20,724
''l don't like farewells.
- Okay, but drop me home, will you?''

1220
02:16:21,799 --> 02:16:22,993
My bangle?

1221
02:16:26,403 --> 02:16:28,735
''Rahul, have you seen my bangle?''

1222
02:16:30,341 --> 02:16:35,745
Damn! Now l am sure l won't find it.
lt was my favorite bangle.

1223
02:16:35,813 --> 02:16:37,075
''Mine, too.''

1224
02:16:40,818 --> 02:16:42,285
Rahul !

1225
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:45,012
''Come on, give it to me.''

1226
02:16:46,023 --> 02:16:47,752
Come here and take it.

1227
02:16:48,092 --> 02:16:52,028
What childish behavior! Give it to me!

1228
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:54,229
Come closer.

1229
02:16:56,033 --> 02:16:57,762
Here goes... happy?

1230
02:16:58,102 --> 02:16:59,296
Come closer.

1231
02:16:59,837 --> 02:17:03,295
''Closer...
- Rahul, stop it!''

1232
02:17:03,841 --> 02:17:05,103
Closer...

1233
02:17:24,461 --> 02:17:25,792
Closer...

1234
02:17:29,867 --> 02:17:31,129
Closer still...

1235
02:17:34,405 --> 02:17:35,804
Closer...

1236
02:19:05,229 --> 02:19:09,495
''How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something''

1237
02:19:10,234 --> 02:19:15,228
''You say something, l'll
say something, my love''

1238
02:19:20,244 --> 02:19:25,181
''How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something''

1239
02:19:25,916 --> 02:19:29,909
''You say something, l'll
say something, my love''

1240
02:19:41,198 --> 02:19:50,937
''We would rather have died than
reveal our secret, oh my love''

1241
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:48,994
''You were a few steps away from me,
l was a few steps away from you''

1242
02:20:58,675 --> 02:21:04,079
''Yet we may as well have
been hundreds of miles apart''

1243
02:21:04,148 --> 02:21:14,023
''Step by step our wavering
hearts came together, my love''

1244
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:22,086
''Come, you have won me over
and l am defeated by my heart''

1245
02:22:31,435 --> 02:22:36,702
''Today with great
difficulty my lips say 'love'''

1246
02:22:36,773 --> 02:22:41,437
''Now l'm madly in love...''

1247
02:22:41,511 --> 02:22:47,108
''don't ever leave me, my love''

1248
02:22:47,184 --> 02:22:51,450
''How long shall we sit in silence?
We both want to say something''

1249
02:22:52,456 --> 02:22:57,120
''You say something, l'll
say something, my love''

1250
02:25:01,518 --> 02:25:03,247
The set is ready.

1251
02:25:04,254 --> 02:25:07,519
''Good, well done. Call Pooja.''

1252
02:25:08,325 --> 02:25:10,259
Okay. Shruti Call Pooja.

1253
02:25:17,401 --> 02:25:19,266
''Pooja, we're ready.''

1254
02:25:22,873 --> 02:25:25,273
Are you angry with me?
- Not at all.

1255
02:25:27,878 --> 02:25:31,279
Then why aren't you speaking to me?
- l am speaking to you.

1256
02:25:32,616 --> 02:25:36,882
For three days l haven't seen
your face or heard your voice.

1257
02:25:37,621 --> 02:25:39,885
l was very busy.

1258
02:25:39,956 --> 02:25:43,551
l have been calling you everyday.
Why haven't you been answering ?

1259
02:25:44,361 --> 02:25:46,761
The phone has been out
of order for some time.

1260
02:25:57,841 --> 02:25:59,308
What is the problem?

1261
02:26:01,645 --> 02:26:05,308
Tell me. l want to know the
cause of your restlessness.

1262
02:26:06,450 --> 02:26:09,510
There's no problem.
- There is a problem.

1263
02:26:10,387 --> 02:26:12,321
Serious problem.

1264
02:26:13,457 --> 02:26:18,793
The fact is that we both
love each other very much.

1265
02:26:20,597 --> 02:26:23,327
We can't tell each other about it.

1266
02:26:27,003 --> 02:26:30,336
Today l've come here to tell you...

1267
02:26:33,009 --> 02:26:34,943
that l love you.

1268
02:26:36,012 --> 02:26:37,673
l love you very much.

1269
02:26:39,015 --> 02:26:41,882
And l know that you also love me.

1270
02:26:42,018 --> 02:26:48,355
''So then, say it once and that will
be the end of your restlessness.''

1271
02:26:49,693 --> 02:26:51,354
Everything will be all right.

1272
02:26:53,964 --> 02:26:56,626
l don't love you.
- You're lying.

1273
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:59,362
l'm not lying.
- You aren't?

1274
02:27:00,704 --> 02:27:08,372
Look into my eyes and tell me
that we weren't made for each other.

1275
02:27:09,579 --> 02:27:10,841
We weren't.

1276
02:27:11,448 --> 02:27:16,579
''Tell me that when l go away from you,
that you don't turn to look at me.''

1277
02:27:17,654 --> 02:27:18,916
l don't.

1278
02:27:19,723 --> 02:27:24,717
''Tell me, when l touch
you nothing happens to you.''

1279
02:27:27,531 --> 02:27:29,931
Nothing.
- Tell me...

1280
02:27:31,067 --> 02:27:34,002
that you don't want to
come into my arms right now.

1281
02:27:36,473 --> 02:27:37,872
l don't.

1282
02:27:38,074 --> 02:27:44,070
Look into my eyes just once and
tell me that you don't love me.

1283
02:27:48,485 --> 02:27:49,747
l don't...

1284
02:27:52,756 --> 02:27:54,417
l don't...

1285
02:27:56,493 --> 02:27:58,017
l don't!

1286
02:28:04,768 --> 02:28:07,430
Terrific performance! Very well done!

1287
02:28:14,778 --> 02:28:16,109
Nisha!

1288
02:28:20,784 --> 02:28:23,446
Hi.
- Great to see you back again.

1289
02:28:29,526 --> 02:28:35,465
But l am sure that when l'm not
here you'll remember me often...

1290
02:28:35,532 --> 02:28:41,471
''and when l get back, you will
be on your knees begging me...''

1291
02:28:41,538 --> 02:28:46,942
to marry you. And then
perhaps l may not want to.

1292
02:28:50,814 --> 02:28:52,679
''Well, l'll be off.''

1293
02:28:53,149 --> 02:28:55,947
l'm a little tired.
l'll see you all tomorrow.

1294
02:28:59,556 --> 02:29:02,491
What's up with Nisha?
- She's tired. She'll come tomorrow.

1295
02:29:02,559 --> 02:29:04,493
Don't get unnecessarily worried.

1296
02:29:32,856 --> 02:29:35,051
''l'm not a nice girl, Rahul.''

1297
02:29:37,861 --> 02:29:42,855
l'm bad. l'm really bad.

1298
02:29:43,867 --> 02:29:47,735
''No Nisha, you are my friend.''

1299
02:29:48,872 --> 02:29:52,205
And no friend of mine is bad.

1300
02:29:53,543 --> 02:29:59,539
''No, Rahul, you don't know
that l am not a nice girl.''

1301
02:30:01,151 --> 02:30:11,550
''Now you see, l love a boy
and have always loved him...''

1302
02:30:12,629 --> 02:30:20,559
and today l realised that he
doesn't love me. He loves someone else.

1303
02:30:21,905 --> 02:30:26,706
''l feel bad, l'm hurt...''

1304
02:30:27,911 --> 02:30:30,573
l'm upset. l feel jealous.

1305
02:30:33,850 --> 02:30:38,583
''Rahul, l shouldn't
feel like this. l am bad.''

1306
02:30:39,923 --> 02:30:42,721
''l am very bad. No, Nisha...''

1307
02:30:42,792 --> 02:30:45,056
''No, Rahul.''

1308
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:52,600
''Actually, that boy
isn't just the one l love...''

1309
02:30:52,669 --> 02:30:55,604
but he's also my best friend.

1310
02:30:57,941 --> 02:31:02,878
''Today, for the first time,
l saw love in his eyes.''

1311
02:31:04,681 --> 02:31:07,616
''l couldn't put love
there in all these years,...''

1312
02:31:08,952 --> 02:31:11,147
but that other girl has.

1313
02:31:12,956 --> 02:31:17,757
Perhaps they are made for each other.

1314
02:31:19,896 --> 02:31:22,091
Perhaps l was never meant for him.

1315
02:31:23,967 --> 02:31:26,629
Perhaps her love for him is true.

1316
02:31:28,705 --> 02:31:33,301
''So you see, l should
be happy for my friend.''

1317
02:31:34,244 --> 02:31:36,644
l should revel in his happiness.

1318
02:31:38,314 --> 02:31:43,251
But l'm not happy... l'm not!

1319
02:31:44,721 --> 02:31:48,657
l'm very bad... really very bad.

1320
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:55,329
''Nisha, you are not bad,
you are really nice.''

1321
02:31:57,667 --> 02:31:59,259
You know who is bad?

1322
02:32:02,739 --> 02:32:04,673
HE is bad...

1323
02:32:06,743 --> 02:32:10,679
THE ONE who plays
around with us humans...

1324
02:32:12,015 --> 02:32:17,681
''making A love B, while B loves C...''

1325
02:32:18,755 --> 02:32:24,694
and C loves D.... l
don't know why HE does this.

1326
02:32:26,362 --> 02:32:30,298
When HE makes one
person love another...

1327
02:32:30,366 --> 02:32:33,699
then HE ought to make sure that the
other one also loves her in return.

1328
02:32:35,038 --> 02:32:36,699
Right?

1329
02:32:41,978 --> 02:32:46,711
But that's not what HE does.
HE's really bad.

1330
02:32:47,984 --> 02:32:54,719
You're not bad. HE's bad.

1331
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:01,053
You're right... lt's HE who's bad.

1332
02:33:03,066 --> 02:33:04,727
HE's bad!

1333
02:33:07,003 --> 02:33:10,734
YOU are bad. l am not. YOU are bad.

1334
02:33:11,074 --> 02:33:15,738
l haven't done anything wrong.
YOU are the one.

1335
02:33:15,879 --> 02:33:23,081
YOU are bad. YOU are bad.

1336
02:33:24,821 --> 02:33:26,083
''l'm sorry, Nisha.''

1337
02:33:32,428 --> 02:33:37,092
''Don't say sorry,
Rahul. Else, l'll cry.''

1338
02:33:38,835 --> 02:33:40,302
''l'm sorry, Nisha.''

1339
02:33:41,037 --> 02:33:44,973
''Don't say sorry, l'll cry.''

1340
02:34:13,136 --> 02:34:14,797
Ajay...

1341
02:34:15,471 --> 02:34:21,137
''when l was a little girl, you
used to tease me about my dreams.''

1342
02:34:22,812 --> 02:34:28,808
When l used to tell you that l am
looking for the one meant for me...

1343
02:34:28,885 --> 02:34:33,413
you would say that l am mad and silly.

1344
02:34:34,891 --> 02:34:38,827
You would smile and say
that when l grow up...

1345
02:34:38,895 --> 02:34:41,830
my dreams will vanish.

1346
02:34:43,499 --> 02:34:50,428
''But you know, l have grown up
and my dreams have not vanished.''

1347
02:34:51,507 --> 02:34:55,375
They have grown with me.

1348
02:34:56,913 --> 02:35:00,849
''That day, at the airport, when you
suddenly asked me to marry you...''

1349
02:35:00,917 --> 02:35:03,852
at first l didn't
realise what l should do.

1350
02:35:05,188 --> 02:35:11,855
''But then l thought, l was crazy...''

1351
02:35:11,928 --> 02:35:21,200
''you were my dearest friend,
and the one who knew me the most.''

1352
02:35:22,205 --> 02:35:24,332
Who could be better for me.

1353
02:35:25,408 --> 02:35:29,071
And l remained standing there.

1354
02:35:31,214 --> 02:35:35,878
You left and l made
you a part of my dreams.

1355
02:35:37,153 --> 02:35:41,351
l started believing that
you were the one made for me.

1356
02:35:43,226 --> 02:35:48,892
And then... and then l met Rahul.

1357
02:35:48,965 --> 02:35:53,902
Ajay! You're marrying Pooja?!
What are you saying?

1358
02:35:54,237 --> 02:35:56,899
But Pooja hasn't said
anything to me about it.

1359
02:35:56,973 --> 02:36:01,376
l had forbidden her from telling you.
l wanted to tell you myself.

1360
02:36:01,577 --> 02:36:06,514
l can hardly believe you! l am
so happy! When are you coming ?

1361
02:36:06,582 --> 02:36:10,450
l called just to tell you this.
l'm coming tomorrow.

1362
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:11,919
Tomorrow...?

1363
02:36:11,988 --> 02:36:15,924
What can l tell you about Rahul?
Where do l start?

1364
02:36:17,260 --> 02:36:22,926
''Well, you should realise that
l've never met anyone like him.''

1365
02:36:24,467 --> 02:36:27,925
''Sometimes he's an angel,
sometimes a devil.''

1366
02:36:29,205 --> 02:36:32,072
Sometimes crazy...
and sometimes a genius.

1367
02:36:33,276 --> 02:36:35,938
Sometimes he scolds so harshly...

1368
02:36:36,012 --> 02:36:38,947
and sometimes he makes
funny faces to make me laugh.

1369
02:36:40,616 --> 02:36:46,418
At times he's more stubborn than a kid
and at times he's a beloved companion..

1370
02:36:46,489 --> 02:36:51,483
''ln three days? Oh no, l want time to
get things ready for a big wedding.''

1371
02:36:51,627 --> 02:36:55,961
''Ma, l don't have time. The company
is sending me to Japan for a year.''

1372
02:36:56,099 --> 02:36:58,966
You'll have to wait
for eight to ten months.

1373
02:36:59,035 --> 02:37:01,435
l can't wait that long.

1374
02:37:01,571 --> 02:37:04,438
''All right, you come here and
l'll start the preparations.''

1375
02:37:04,507 --> 02:37:06,975
''The dreams of your crazy
girl have come true, Ajay.''

1376
02:37:08,111 --> 02:37:10,978
She has found the
partner of her dreams...

1377
02:37:12,582 --> 02:37:20,580
and she wants your permission
to make all her dreams come true.

1378
02:37:22,592 --> 02:37:25,584
Can she make her dreams come true?

1379
02:37:52,355 --> 02:37:57,156
Ajay phoned just now.
He's told me everything.

1380
02:37:58,094 --> 02:38:00,358
''He's coming tomorrow, Pooja...''

1381
02:38:00,429 --> 02:38:03,489
...and he says to get the wedding
organised as quickly as possible.

1382
02:38:04,367 --> 02:38:07,029
You would tell me
your smallest secrets...

1383
02:38:07,103 --> 02:38:11,369
and you hid such a big one from me ?

1384
02:38:13,042 --> 02:38:14,168
Come here...

1385
02:38:17,246 --> 02:38:19,043
sit by my side.

1386
02:38:26,389 --> 02:38:30,052
''You know, Pooja, ever since
you came to this house,...''

1387
02:38:30,393 --> 02:38:35,057
''l've had a dream in which, one day,
you would become my daughter-in-law''

1388
02:38:35,398 --> 02:38:40,597
And l your mother.

1389
02:38:42,205 --> 02:38:44,400
''But l was apprehensive, l
didn't know how the two of you...''

1390
02:38:44,473 --> 02:38:46,407
would feel about each
other when you grew up.

1391
02:38:46,742 --> 02:38:51,076
Whether you would be friends
and care about each other or not.

1392
02:38:51,747 --> 02:39:00,348
''l also wanted that you should decide
if at all because you wanted it,...''

1393
02:39:00,423 --> 02:39:02,357
not for my sake.

1394
02:39:03,092 --> 02:39:08,086
l wanted you to choose Ajay
out of your own free will.

1395
02:39:08,764 --> 02:39:13,098
''You don't know how
happy l am, for l know...''

1396
02:39:13,169 --> 02:39:21,634
that there cannot be better
girl than you for my son.

1397
02:39:22,445 --> 02:39:27,109
Just watch. l'm going to
give you a grand wedding.

1398
02:39:28,384 --> 02:39:33,651
You have no idea how happy l am.

1399
02:39:36,192 --> 02:39:37,386
May you live long.

1400
02:40:40,523 --> 02:40:44,721
l want full lights and l want to see
M6 on both left and right of stage.

1401
02:40:44,860 --> 02:40:47,192
''Supandi, in a while l want
to hear the music tracks.''

1402
02:40:47,263 --> 02:40:51,199
''Soni, the elevation should
be three feet higher...''

1403
02:40:51,267 --> 02:40:53,792
or else the audience on stage
right will not know what is going on.

1404
02:40:53,869 --> 02:40:56,531
''When Ballu lights M6, one spot
light will filter here on this side...''

1405
02:40:56,605 --> 02:40:59,403
and the audience will get a
glimpse of the entry before it happens.

1406
02:40:59,475 --> 02:41:00,669
Hi Pooja.

1407
02:41:06,549 --> 02:41:09,211
l need to talk to you.

1408
02:41:09,285 --> 02:41:12,220
''The show opens in two days,
we'll talk later.''

1409
02:41:16,892 --> 02:41:21,556
Show me all the costumes of
act three. Go do some work.

1410
02:41:25,568 --> 02:41:31,564
''l have to talk to you.
- Pooja, just a minute.''

1411
02:41:37,780 --> 02:41:40,248
Okay... tell me what's the problem?

1412
02:41:40,850 --> 02:41:44,513
''Rahul, please try and
understand what l am about to tell you.''

1413
02:41:44,587 --> 02:41:47,249
''Rahul, Nisha is calling you.
The stadium has called.''

1414
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:51,248
l forgot to talk to her. l'll
be right back. Where's Nisha?

1415
02:41:55,598 --> 02:41:57,259
Rahul please be serious...

1416
02:41:57,933 --> 02:41:59,264
Ajay...?

1417
02:41:59,402 --> 02:42:03,270
''My name is Ajay, but if you
like you can call me Rahul.''

1418
02:42:04,940 --> 02:42:09,274
Fatty! l love you!

1419
02:42:11,614 --> 02:42:13,741
l really missed you.

1420
02:42:16,485 --> 02:42:21,286
''Remember, l told you
that l'd come to get you ?''

1421
02:42:21,357 --> 02:42:24,622
Here l am. l came
here after meeting mom.

1422
02:42:24,894 --> 02:42:30,560
''She is so happy. Hey, l hope
you haven't changed your mind?''

1423
02:42:30,633 --> 02:42:32,294
''You're marrying me, aren't you?''

1424
02:42:32,968 --> 02:42:36,301
Have you told your friends?
- l was going to...

1425
02:42:36,372 --> 02:42:39,307
''Hear that! l'll have to do that, too?''

1426
02:42:39,375 --> 02:42:42,310
l'll tell them.

1427
02:42:42,378 --> 02:42:46,974
Ladies and gentlemen...
l'm sorry for the intrusion.

1428
02:42:47,383 --> 02:42:50,841
You don't know my name: it's Ajay.

1429
02:42:52,388 --> 02:42:54,379
l am Pooja's childhood friend.

1430
02:42:55,591 --> 02:42:58,321
And since she hasn't
found a worthy guy...

1431
02:42:58,394 --> 02:43:01,329
l took pity on her and l
am going to marry her.

1432
02:43:01,397 --> 02:43:04,798
Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.

1433
02:43:09,405 --> 02:43:14,672
''ln three days we are getting married
and you all must come, with family.''

1434
02:43:29,692 --> 02:43:33,958
''Pooja, you're weird. Why
didn't you tell us before?''

1435
02:43:34,029 --> 02:43:37,362
We had begun to feel
that you were our Maya.

1436
02:43:37,700 --> 02:43:41,363
We forgot you're Pooja and
you have your own private life...

1437
02:43:41,437 --> 02:43:44,838
...and your own relationships
and even prior commitments.

1438
02:43:45,441 --> 02:43:48,035
We are really stupid!

1439
02:43:48,377 --> 02:43:51,369
''Oh l forgot... Pooja, congratulations.''

1440
02:43:52,715 --> 02:43:55,377
Thanks.
- And this is...

1441
02:43:55,718 --> 02:43:57,982
''This is Rahul, our director.''

1442
02:43:58,053 --> 02:44:02,717
''Rahul, she likes your name a lot.
- She likes only the name...?''

1443
02:44:02,791 --> 02:44:04,918
''l hope so, man!
- Congratulations.''

1444
02:44:04,994 --> 02:44:08,657
''Thank you. Rahul, l have a request.
- Go on.''

1445
02:44:08,731 --> 02:44:11,393
May l take her away for an hour?
- Oh come on!

1446
02:44:11,467 --> 02:44:14,402
You are taking her
away forever from us.

1447
02:44:14,537 --> 02:44:17,938
''That will be in a
ceremonious way. Say what, Pooja?''

1448
02:44:18,474 --> 02:44:22,410
This is just a lunch date with Pooja.
Do l have your permission...?

1449
02:44:22,478 --> 02:44:26,744
My permission! Now l'll have to
get your permission to meet Pooja.

1450
02:44:28,083 --> 02:44:33,077
''Besides, now that you've come, Pooja
won't be happy here, will you Pooja?''

1451
02:44:33,756 --> 02:44:37,021
So go on. l'll get by without you.

1452
02:44:37,092 --> 02:44:39,959
''Are you sure?
- Yes, of course! Absolutely!''

1453
02:44:40,496 --> 02:44:42,430
You guys go and have
a good time. Go on.

1454
02:44:42,498 --> 02:44:45,956
We have his permission... let's go.
- Go on.

1455
02:44:46,035 --> 02:44:51,439
''Okay guys. Bye.
After three days, okay?''

1456
02:45:07,790 --> 02:45:10,987
''Ballu, show me the final mix.''

1457
02:45:12,795 --> 02:45:15,457
''Shruti, show me the sketches.''

1458
02:45:16,799 --> 02:45:20,792
''And Nisha, call up the
auditorium and tell them the sketches...''

1459
02:45:20,869 --> 02:45:22,598
will be with them by the evening.

1460
02:45:23,806 --> 02:45:26,468
ln two days we are going on stage...

1461
02:45:42,825 --> 02:45:47,489
Lights! why aren't you
showing me the lights.

1462
02:45:48,564 --> 02:45:51,499
There are just two days...
and you're taking it easy!

1463
02:45:51,567 --> 02:45:53,034
''Come on, the lights.''

1464
02:45:53,769 --> 02:45:56,761
''Shruti, show me the sketches,
Shruti, here, fast!''

1465
02:45:56,839 --> 02:46:03,506
Hurry up! We got to finish
the music rehearsals too!

1466
02:46:10,519 --> 02:46:15,115
This is our last meeting.
l'm getting married tomorrow.

1467
02:46:16,191 --> 02:46:20,525
l don't want to meet you
ever again after today.

1468
02:46:21,864 --> 02:46:25,595
Just think that l was
never a part of your life.

1469
02:46:39,148 --> 02:46:43,551
''As soon as l start to move,
track me with the spotlight...''

1470
02:46:43,619 --> 02:46:46,884
and the other will stay on Pooja.

1471
02:46:48,557 --> 02:46:54,223
''When l get right up to the audience,
then slowly dim the light.''

1472
02:46:55,898 --> 02:47:00,562
The show will be over... The End.

1473
02:47:04,106 --> 02:47:08,566
''That's it. Any questions? l
don't want any mistakes, okay?''

1474
02:47:08,911 --> 02:47:10,572
''Rajesh, everything all right?
- Yeah.''

1475
02:47:10,646 --> 02:47:13,911
''Okay then, tomorrow be
at the stadium on time.''

1476
02:47:14,583 --> 02:47:15,777
Pack up.

1477
02:47:17,920 --> 02:47:20,582
Something is bothering me.
- What?

1478
02:47:20,656 --> 02:47:23,784
l don't like the end of your story.
- Why?

1479
02:47:24,259 --> 02:47:27,717
This ending's too sad.

1480
02:47:28,263 --> 02:47:31,198
A love story should
always have a happy ending.

1481
02:47:31,734 --> 02:47:34,931
''The audience should
come out smiling, right?''

1482
02:47:35,938 --> 02:47:38,600
People like to live in a dream world.

1483
02:47:39,942 --> 02:47:44,879
''They have seen many dreams, now
let them see a little reality.''

1484
02:47:45,948 --> 02:47:49,281
Every love story is
like this in real life.

1485
02:47:49,952 --> 02:47:52,819
Full of sorrow and pain.

1486
02:47:59,962 --> 02:48:03,625
''No, Nisha, this ending
is absolutely right.''

1487
02:48:05,167 --> 02:48:09,900
There can't be another
end to this love story.

1488
02:49:11,033 --> 02:49:15,697
''l know a girl, when she smiles,...''

1489
02:49:15,771 --> 02:49:19,707
''it rains''

1490
02:49:20,042 --> 02:49:24,035
''l know a boy, when he sings...''

1491
02:49:24,112 --> 02:49:28,378
''it rains''

1492
02:49:44,333 --> 02:49:47,268
''Jimmy, just go and check
the next entry stage left.''

1493
02:50:03,085 --> 02:50:06,885
''The heart is crazy,
just refuses to listen.''

1494
02:50:35,384 --> 02:50:41,789
''Oh dear, what's happening?
l don't really know''

1495
02:50:41,857 --> 02:50:48,786
''l only hope this does
not turn into a romance''

1496
02:50:48,864 --> 02:50:55,064
''Oh dear, what's happening?
Nobody really knows''

1497
02:50:55,137 --> 02:51:01,804
''But if this is a romance,
then so be it''

1498
02:51:42,184 --> 02:51:45,847
Pooja's last entry is after this.
Get her ready and bring her here.

1499
02:51:45,921 --> 02:51:48,048
Don't worry. Nisha's getting her.

1500
02:51:50,926 --> 02:51:52,188
Thanks.

1501
02:51:54,529 --> 02:51:56,463
''Don't make this mistake, Pooja.''

1502
02:51:58,867 --> 02:52:06,865
Very few people are lucky
enough to love and to be loved.

1503
02:52:09,144 --> 02:52:14,548
''You can't break the tie,
which HE has ordained.''

1504
02:52:15,951 --> 02:52:17,885
You can't break it.

1505
02:52:21,957 --> 02:52:27,896
''l've spent my years giving
love the name of friendship,...''

1506
02:52:27,963 --> 02:52:32,900
now you are going to spend
the rest of your life...

1507
02:52:32,968 --> 02:52:36,904
giving friendship the name of love.

1508
02:52:38,573 --> 02:52:44,443
This is a betrayal! A betrayal of
love... a betrayal of friendship.

1509
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:46,909
Don't do such a thing!

1510
02:53:00,395 --> 02:53:05,264
This is our last meeting.
l'm getting married tomorrow.

1511
02:53:06,601 --> 02:53:09,934
l don't want to meet you
ever again after today.

1512
02:53:11,540 --> 02:53:14,532
Just think that l was
never a part of your life.

1513
02:53:32,294 --> 02:53:35,422
l want to ask you
something before you go.

1514
02:53:38,567 --> 02:53:41,968
Did you ever love me...

1515
02:53:42,037 --> 02:53:47,566
even for a single
day or a single moment?

1516
02:53:49,644 --> 02:53:52,442
This line is not in the play.
- Raju!

1517
02:53:54,049 --> 02:53:56,244
Tell me just once...

1518
02:53:56,318 --> 02:54:01,449
have you ever really
loved me? Even for a moment?

1519
02:54:03,325 --> 02:54:05,316
What the hell is Rahul saying?!

1520
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:14,535
l shan't go away until l
get an answer to my question.

1521
02:54:16,671 --> 02:54:18,332
l'm not going!

1522
02:54:21,343 --> 02:54:26,679
''Did you ever love me,
even for a single moment?''

1523
02:54:30,085 --> 02:54:32,019
No.
- What did you say?

1524
02:54:33,288 --> 02:54:36,280
l didn't hear that.
- No.

1525
02:54:36,358 --> 02:54:40,021
''Speak up, l couldn't hear.''

1526
02:54:41,363 --> 02:54:45,026
''No.
- Louder, louder..''

1527
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:49,031
''No, l have never loved you.''

1528
02:54:50,372 --> 02:54:56,311
''Not for a day, not
for a moment. Never.''

1529
02:54:59,648 --> 02:55:01,582
That is all l wanted to hear.

1530
02:55:10,659 --> 02:55:15,392
''l'm Rahul,... you will
remember my name, won't you?''

1531
02:55:39,421 --> 02:55:43,619
What can l tell you about Rahul.
Where do l start from?

1532
02:55:44,159 --> 02:55:49,290
l have never met anyone like him.

1533
02:55:50,432 --> 02:55:53,424
''Sometimes he's an angel,
sometimes, a devil.''

1534
02:55:53,768 --> 02:55:56,760
''Sometimes he's crazy,
sometimes he is a genius.''

1535
02:55:57,639 --> 02:56:01,097
Sometimes he scolds very harshly
and sometimes he makes faces...

1536
02:56:01,176 --> 02:56:03,110
and makes me laugh.

1537
02:56:04,446 --> 02:56:07,108
Sometimes he is more
stubborn than a child is...

1538
02:56:07,182 --> 02:56:10,310
and sometimes he is
a beloved companion.

1539
02:56:11,453 --> 02:56:17,119
''What he is or is not, l
cannot really express in words...''

1540
02:56:17,192 --> 02:56:21,128
but l don't know why...

1541
02:56:40,215 --> 02:56:45,152
''When he looks at me,
l feel beautiful,...''

1542
02:56:46,488 --> 02:56:50,754
when he laughs l feel like dancing.

1543
02:56:51,493 --> 02:56:55,156
When he is upset l feel
like holding him in my arms.

1544
02:56:55,697 --> 02:56:59,690
When he loves me my
eyes fill with tears.

1545
02:57:01,503 --> 02:57:08,500
He has made me realise that l am
made for him... and he for me.

1546
02:57:10,512 --> 02:57:17,714
''l love him very much, not
for one day or one moment...''

1547
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:20,715
but for my whole life.

1548
02:57:22,791 --> 02:57:26,192
''l love you, Rahul. l love you.''

1549
02:57:59,361 --> 02:58:02,558
''Now that l've seen them, l
believe that someone, somewhere...''

1550
02:58:02,630 --> 02:58:04,222
was made for me as well.

1551
02:58:05,300 --> 02:58:07,234
lsn't that true?
- Yes.

1552
02:58:09,571 --> 02:58:12,699
My name is Ajay. Yours?

1553
02:58:12,774 --> 02:58:14,241
l'm Nisha.

1554
02:58:16,578 --> 02:58:19,240
Are you married?
- What...?
