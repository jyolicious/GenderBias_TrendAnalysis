'I will get my son married
to a millionaire's daughter.'

1050
01:19:42,915 --> 01:19:44,387
What a cute child.

1051
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:45,900
- How is the drink?
- Fine.

1052
01:19:45,956 --> 01:19:47,714
Excuse me. Mehra, come here.

1053
01:19:48,635 --> 01:19:49,592
- Mehra.
- Yes?

1054
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:50,620
I just remembered that...

1055
01:19:50,755 --> 01:19:53,475
You remember everything after two pegs.

1056
01:19:53,519 --> 01:19:56,120
I am not kidding. I am serious.

1057
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:58,055
If you care about your
daughter's welfare...

1058
01:19:58,076 --> 01:19:59,912
...then call off this
engagement immediately.

1059
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,404
- Call off the engagement!
- Yes.

1060
01:20:01,445 --> 01:20:03,210
- Are you in your senses?
- Yes, I am...

1061
01:20:03,235 --> 01:20:06,942
...but until you come to your senses,
Hazari Prasad will have looted you.

1062
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:11,105
- What are you saying?
- Yes, he doesn't have any mills.

1063
01:20:11,236 --> 01:20:15,946
He is not a millionaire,
but a junk-shop owner.

1064
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,412
- What?
- Yes.

1065
01:20:17,714 --> 01:20:21,331
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1066
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,159
Actually, he is a junk-shop owner.

1067
01:21:04,571 --> 01:21:07,834
[APPLAUSE]

1068
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:11,389
At a party in 1947 when I
danced with Madhubala...

1069
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,317
...people kept watching.

1070
01:21:13,365 --> 01:21:17,973
I think we should go ahead
with the engagement ceremony.

1071
01:21:18,515 --> 01:21:19,815
The auspicious time will pass by.

1072
01:21:19,878 --> 01:21:24,886
I also think so. The engagement
should take place immediately.

1073
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:27,553
The auspicious time is passing by.
Call Raja and Madhu.

1074
01:21:27,578 --> 01:21:28,748
They will come.

1075
01:21:28,865 --> 01:21:32,044
But I want to introduce
you to some of my guests.

1076
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:35,212
- No! I...
- Come.

1077
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:36,817
Come on.

1078
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:45,004
Friends, I am very happy
to see all of you here.

1079
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:47,633
Before the engagement takes place...

1080
01:21:47,998 --> 01:21:49,935
...I'd like to introduce you to...

1081
01:21:50,366 --> 01:21:52,824
...to the groom's father,
Mr. Hazari Prasad.

1082
01:21:54,737 --> 01:21:56,092
He is a very unique person.

1083
01:21:57,184 --> 01:22:03,070
It will take too long to
speak about his greatness.

1084
01:22:03,927 --> 01:22:05,808
Mr. Mehra, you are flattering me.

1085
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,666
We can do this after the engagement.
The auspicious time is passing.

1086
01:22:08,687 --> 01:22:11,456
The time has arrived now. Just two minutes.

1087
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:18,769
Friends, Mr. Hazari Prasad who
has many chemical factories...

1088
01:22:19,183 --> 01:22:21,489
...who has many textile mills...

1089
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:25,063
...and who is one of the
richest people in this city.

1090
01:22:26,043 --> 01:22:31,348
In reality, he is a cheap junk-shop owner.

1091
01:22:32,395 --> 01:22:33,683
A junk-shop owner.

1092
01:22:35,195 --> 01:22:40,022
The junk...
where we sell our old newspapers!

1093
01:22:41,143 --> 01:22:46,522
Where we sell the old bottles,
torn clothes.

1094
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:50,691
Broken furniture.
These are the things he sells.

1095
01:22:50,816 --> 01:22:53,743
How dare...

1096
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:58,091
...he dream of becoming
my daughter's father-in-law?

1097
01:22:58,132 --> 01:23:01,628
You are insulting me in front of everyone.

1098
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:05,559
Insult! Only those get insulted
who have some self-respect.

1099
01:23:05,706 --> 01:23:07,214
- You have none.
- Mehra!

1100
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,850
Shut your mouth!

1101
01:23:11,894 --> 01:23:14,194
And listen more about this fraudster!

1102
01:23:14,577 --> 01:23:19,604
This conman wanted to
take away my wealth in dowry.

1103
01:23:19,749 --> 01:23:21,115
So that I become penniless.

1104
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,479
- Mehra, if you say one more word, then...
- Then!

1105
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:41,764
Daddy, what have you done?

1106
01:23:41,998 --> 01:23:44,996
He was going to ruin us.

1107
01:23:45,037 --> 01:23:49,021
Thank God,
your life was saved from being destroyed.

1108
01:23:50,435 --> 01:23:53,661
This world will change.

1109
01:23:54,759 --> 01:23:56,211
The stars will change.

1110
01:23:57,185 --> 01:23:58,679
The earth and the sky will also change...

1111
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,325
...but Hazari Prasad
won't forget this insult.

1112
01:24:03,367 --> 01:24:08,981
Hazari Prasad will remember it forever.

1113
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:15,468
One day he will make you pay for this.
I'll surly make you pay for this.

1114
01:24:16,477 --> 01:24:17,675
Raja, let's go.

1115
01:24:25,724 --> 01:24:27,762
RAJA: <i>Excuse me, Madam.
I want to meet Mr. Mehra.</i>

1116
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:29,382
FEMALE: <i>He is
very busy right now.</i>

1117
01:24:29,406 --> 01:24:31,393
RAJA: <i>It's very
important that I meet him.</i>

1118
01:24:31,642 --> 01:24:32,396
RAJA: <i>I must meet him.</i>

1119
01:24:32,436 --> 01:24:34,672
FEMALE: <i>Okay, wait here.
I will just check up.</i>

1120
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:36,634
Write to Bennet and Miranda that...

1121
01:24:36,675 --> 01:24:39,593
...we liked their proposals and
ask them to send the details.

1122
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:41,117
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.

1123
01:24:41,155 --> 01:24:43,515
Someone called Raja wants to meet you.

1124
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:49,864
Tell him that I don't
have time to meet him.

1125
01:24:50,324 --> 01:24:52,192
Okay, sir. I am sorry.

1126
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:53,286
So what was I saying?

1127
01:24:53,358 --> 01:24:54,537
You were saying something
about Bennet and Miranda.

1128
01:24:54,578 --> 01:24:55,930
I want to say something to you.

1129
01:24:56,137 --> 01:24:59,384
Write to them that we are not
at all interested in their proposal.

1130
01:24:59,555 --> 01:25:00,938
Sir, listen to me.

1131
01:25:00,979 --> 01:25:04,569
Write to them that talking
further about this is useless.

1132
01:25:04,888 --> 01:25:06,668
It would be just the waste of my time.

1133
01:25:06,721 --> 01:25:09,148
You have an issue with my father.
Why are you punishing me?

1134
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:11,389
Write further that it was our mistake...

1135
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,606
...to think they were
capable of this proposal.

1136
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:17,343
Had I known earlier that
they were so unfit and cheats...

1137
01:25:17,368 --> 01:25:17,837
Should I also write that?

1138
01:25:17,877 --> 01:25:20,030
- Note it down, Varma.
- Yes, sir.

1139
01:25:20,691 --> 01:25:22,793
At least think about Madhu.

1140
01:25:22,925 --> 01:25:24,161
Why are you spoiling her life?

1141
01:25:24,274 --> 01:25:28,135
- Also write to them that we don't
need their cheap advice. - Right.

1142
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:31,237
Then listen to me.

1143
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,388
Like other marriages take
place without your permission...

1144
01:25:34,986 --> 01:25:37,554
...this marriage will take place
without your permission too.

1145
01:25:37,982 --> 01:25:41,039
So, finally you've shown your true colours.

1146
01:25:42,104 --> 01:25:46,443
If you drag this matter
further I will get you killed.

1147
01:25:47,278 --> 01:25:49,000
I am talking to you politely and you...

1148
01:25:49,041 --> 01:25:50,475
Will you teach me about propriety?

1149
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,987
You have to be born with good manners.

1150
01:25:53,635 --> 01:25:57,372
You and your father have no manners at all.

1151
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:01,395
Mr. Mehra, I used to respect you a lot.

1152
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:06,788
But you are a very cheap person.

1153
01:26:07,289 --> 01:26:08,059
What did you say?

1154
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,075
Call the police!

1155
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:27,087
Get the security!

1156
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:35,726
Stop this now!

1157
01:26:44,826 --> 01:26:46,139
Just stop it!

1158
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:00,687
'There was a house here earlier,
but looks like ruins now.'

1159
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:04,481
'Your face looks like the battlefield.'

1160
01:27:04,522 --> 01:27:06,251
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1161
01:27:06,582 --> 01:27:07,541
Have it, sir.

1162
01:27:07,808 --> 01:27:08,534
Hey!

1163
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:11,456
What's going on?

1164
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:16,926
'You are responsible for all this mess.'

1165
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:20,091
'You are responsible for his torn pants.'

1166
01:27:20,453 --> 01:27:23,169
'Don't assume you will escape punishment.'

1167
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:26,656
- 'I am Ghalib, the protector of the law!'
- Wonderful!

1168
01:27:26,704 --> 01:27:29,378
This is the guy. Inspector, arrest him.

1169
01:27:30,205 --> 01:27:31,493
Arrest him.

1170
01:27:31,557 --> 01:27:32,978
He creates a chaos.

1171
01:27:33,124 --> 01:27:35,857
I will put him in jail
and teach him a lesson.

1172
01:27:36,675 --> 01:27:39,700
- What? Father has put Raja in prison.
- Yes.

1173
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:43,875
Isn't your father a lawyer?

1174
01:27:44,071 --> 01:27:45,479
Let's bail him out.

1175
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:48,444
- My father can't bail him out today.
- Why?

1176
01:27:48,691 --> 01:27:51,425
Because today is Saturday.
The courts will open only on Monday.

1177
01:27:52,382 --> 01:27:53,500
Oh my God!

1178
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,878
Raja will have to spend two days in prison.

1179
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:06,852
Hey!

1180
01:28:09,001 --> 01:28:11,525
Are you trying to commit suicide?

1181
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:13,583
- I will put you behind bars.
- Please do it.

1182
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,027
No! I won't. I am in a good mood today.

1183
01:28:16,087 --> 01:28:18,161
- Yes. Come on!
- Listen!

1184
01:28:18,237 --> 01:28:19,619
Under which other crime
can you put me in prison?

1185
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:21,847
- In what crime? Tell her.
- If you kill someone.

1186
01:28:21,888 --> 01:28:24,236
- If you pickpocket.
- If you rape someone.

1187
01:28:24,277 --> 01:28:27,384
- Also if you hit any officer.
- Oh! Thank you.

1188
01:28:30,035 --> 01:28:33,539
- You hit him really hard!
- Thank you.

1189
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:37,986
- She has hit me. Now I will hit her.
- Yes, sure.

1190
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:41,732
How dare you hit me?

1191
01:28:41,973 --> 01:28:43,534
You!

1192
01:28:45,315 --> 01:28:47,777
That was really hard. I won't spare you.

1193
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:50,799
Help me! Help me!

[INDISTINCT]

1195
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:00,997
Yes.

1196
01:29:01,187 --> 01:29:04,213
Civil police riots!
I will put you in prison for causing riots!

1197
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,488
Section 920, come on!

1198
01:29:07,272 --> 01:29:11,276
After coming in here all
women stick to the right path.

1199
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:12,496
You too will learn your lesson.

1200
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:16,457
Come on! Get inside.

1201
01:29:25,515 --> 01:29:26,698
Raja!

1202
01:29:28,774 --> 01:29:30,193
Madhu, why are you here?

1203
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:32,436
Do you remember both
of us had taken an oath?

1204
01:29:32,744 --> 01:29:34,430
Both of us will always be together.

1205
01:29:34,595 --> 01:29:41,145
That's why you were so
eager to come to prison.

1206
01:29:41,186 --> 01:29:42,972
The world has become so cruel...

1207
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:47,983
...that prison is the only
place we can meet peacefully.

1208
01:29:48,234 --> 01:29:51,242
I had thought love had
vanished from the world.

1209
01:29:51,374 --> 01:29:55,322
But both of you have
made me forget my duty.

1210
01:29:55,913 --> 01:30:00,298
I am the protector of all
the lovers in this world.

1211
01:30:00,526 --> 01:30:03,977
Anybody who tries to destroy your love...

1212
01:30:04,213 --> 01:30:07,420
...will face my fury.

1213
01:30:08,074 --> 01:30:09,554
- Inspector!
- Yes.

1214
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:12,321
Where is my son?
I am asking you, where's my son, inspector?

1215
01:30:12,362 --> 01:30:14,589
- His mother must know.
- My son's name is Raja.

1216
01:30:14,778 --> 01:30:17,889
For what crime have you put him in jail?
Set him free.

1217
01:30:18,004 --> 01:30:20,450

02:14:40,621 --> 02:14:43,012
Hey! He has dashed a girl!

1729
02:14:43,455 --> 02:14:45,164
Oh God!

1730
02:14:46,607 --> 02:14:48,184
Excuse me. Move.

1731
02:14:49,235 --> 02:14:53,095
Oh my God! Madhu! Daughter!

1732
02:14:54,819 --> 02:14:57,473
- Guard. Driver, bring some water.
- Sir, water.

1733
02:15:02,237 --> 02:15:03,461
My child!

1734
02:15:05,603 --> 02:15:06,453
Daddy!

1735
02:15:07,408 --> 02:15:09,486
- Daddy, I want to die.
- No.

1736
02:15:09,875 --> 02:15:10,876
I want to die.

1737
02:15:10,916 --> 02:15:13,147
No, child.
I'll not let you die, my daughter.

1738
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:15,994
Who has done this to you? Who is he?

[CLUNKS]

1740
02:15:29,974 --> 02:15:32,345
Mr. Mehra! What is this that I am seeing?

1741
02:15:32,619 --> 02:15:35,567
A rich man's daughter, in this condition.

1742
02:15:35,947 --> 02:15:37,979
It seems she has not eaten for many days.

1743
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:40,283
Whereas Mr. Mehra has four hotels.

1744
02:15:41,157 --> 02:15:42,017
Look at her clothes!

1745
02:15:42,115 --> 02:15:44,003
She doesn't even have
proper clothes to cover herself.

1746
02:15:44,044 --> 02:15:46,618
Mr. Mehra has six mills of cloth.

1747
02:15:47,113 --> 02:15:49,089
Ladies and gentlemen,
maybe you all don't know him...

1748
02:15:49,130 --> 02:15:51,280
...but I know Mr. Mehra very well.

1749
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:55,110
Seeing all this,
I am unable to believe my eyes.

1750
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:57,346
The daughter whose one sob would shake...

1751
02:15:57,387 --> 02:15:59,564
...the very foundation
of Mehra Industries...

1752
02:16:00,143 --> 02:16:01,687
...the same daughter
is like a corpse today.

1753
02:16:01,851 --> 02:16:02,739
Hazari!

1754
02:16:03,077 --> 02:16:05,041
There is no use of shouting, Mr. Mehra.

1755
02:16:05,677 --> 02:16:07,784
Just have some pity on
your daughter's condition!

1756
02:16:08,352 --> 02:16:13,992
So gentlemen, this helpless girl
fell in love and ran away from home.

1757
02:16:14,998 --> 02:16:18,909
As it always happens,
her lover threw her out of the house.

1758
02:16:19,622 --> 02:16:21,708
Now why did he throw her out?
I don't know anything about that.

1759
02:16:21,733 --> 02:16:23,233
Only Mr. Mehra can enlighten you on that.

1760
02:16:23,607 --> 02:16:26,208
But I have a request.

1761
02:16:26,785 --> 02:16:28,931
If there is some good marriage
proposal then let him know.

1762
02:16:29,303 --> 02:16:30,507
Do not worry about the money.

1763
02:16:30,763 --> 02:16:33,818
Mr. Mehra has lots of money!
You will get a big dowry.

1764
02:16:33,904 --> 02:16:36,241
We are not so shameless that we
will use the things which others...

1765
02:16:36,412 --> 02:16:37,767
...have used and thrown.

1766
02:16:39,132 --> 02:16:40,569
Did you hear him, Mr. Mehra?

1767
02:16:40,928 --> 02:16:43,170
Now your daughter
has just two options left.

1768
02:16:43,365 --> 02:16:46,360
Either she commits suicide
or she can become a prostitute.

1769
02:16:46,385 --> 02:16:49,194
- Shut your mouth, Hazari!
- You shut your mouth, Mehra!

1770
02:16:52,704 --> 02:16:56,113
Take my shawl and cover this corpse.

1771
02:16:56,844 --> 02:17:00,492
It is a bit worn out because
it belongs to a scrap vendor.

1772
02:17:00,892 --> 02:17:03,772
But it is sufficient to cover
your daughter's dignity.

1773
02:17:04,485 --> 02:17:09,250
Also take this bowl and start
begging for your daughter's life.

1774
02:17:10,164 --> 02:17:12,350
Remember one thing, Mehra.

1775
02:17:13,354 --> 02:17:18,116
The slap that cannot be seen hurts more.

1776
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:22,288
Idiot!

1777
02:17:27,846 --> 02:17:29,770
You beast.

1778
02:17:32,722 --> 02:17:35,256
Take this, child. Have the medicine.

1779

First tell me, where is Madhu?

1780
02:17:40,249 --> 02:17:42,045
Whenever I ask you,
you always evade the issue.

1781
02:17:43,529 --> 02:17:45,222
Why don't you tell me where is she?

1782
02:17:45,608 --> 02:17:47,517
How is she? She is fine, isn't it?

1783
02:17:47,877 --> 02:17:49,829
However she is, I want to see her.
I want to meet her.

1784
02:17:50,079 --> 02:17:52,646
- Where is Madhu, Mother?
- Do you want to know where Madhu is?

1785
02:17:53,166 --> 02:17:54,185
How she is?

1786
02:17:54,474 --> 02:17:55,478
Then listen to me, son.

1787
02:17:56,221 --> 02:17:59,535
The Madhu,
for whom you are in so much pain...

1788
02:17:59,627 --> 02:18:01,637
...has left you and gone
back to her father's house.

1789

No! You are telling lies!
This is not possible.

1790
02:18:04,913 --> 02:18:08,439
Then why didn't she come to meet
you when you were fighting with death?

1791
02:18:08,665 --> 02:18:10,242
Because she was enjoying
herself at her father's house.

1792
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:11,920
Thank God we reached there in time.

1793
02:18:11,961 --> 02:18:13,532
Otherwise there was
nobody to take care of you.

1794
02:18:13,573 --> 02:18:15,515
No! My Madhu cannot do this.

1795
02:18:16,203 --> 02:18:17,303
She cannot betray me.

1796
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,590
Daddy, she can die for me,
but she cannot leave me alone to die.

had put the holy Mangalsutra...

...she threw it on my face.

Look.

If you trust your eyes more than my
word then go and see it for yourself.

Go and see.

that you would stoop so low.

that my father was right...
