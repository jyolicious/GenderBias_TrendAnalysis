00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.333
 You know. 
2
00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:21.916
 Miles away from here. 
3
00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.750
 Beyond good and evil. 
4
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:30.916
 There's a ground. 

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,250
 I will meet you there. 

3
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,791
 No, no. 

4
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,000
 No. no. No cheating. 

5
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,583
 Catch him. 

6
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:33,416
 Don't let him go. 

7
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,750
 Run. 

8
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:30,125
 Often I've wondered 

9
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,458
 You, me, we are all mirrors 

10
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,250
 We catch our reflection in everyone 

11
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,416
 It's not me, yet I am 

12
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,166
 Right... 

13
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,416
 Wrong... 

14
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,541
 I'm yours 

15
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,208
 To find me 

16
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,333
 Is to find yourself 

17
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,791
 All that I 

18
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,750
 Wish to say 

19
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:04,666
 Is ruined by 

20
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,791
 My words 

21
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,208
 My words 

22
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,083
 Lovely. 

23
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,166
 Often I feel that 

24
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,625
 This whole world is magic 

25
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,500
 Which Is 

26
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,541
 And yet Is not 

27
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,666
 Seasons, clouds, wind, blossoms 

28
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,875
 They send signals to me 

29
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:21,750
 How do I narrate their tales 

30
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,125
 All that I 

31
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,416
 Wish to say 

32
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:33,250
 Is ruined by 

33
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,500
 My words 

34
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,208
 My words 

35
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,958
 Oh yeah yeah 

36
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,875
 Oh yeah yeah 

37
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,541
 You want to be a Hero, huh? 

38
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,250
 This looks like a theater to you? 

39
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
What's the matter, sir? Sir? - Let go of it! 

40
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,625
 Be careful... the strings... 

41
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,958
 I told you to let go of it! 

42
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,958
 Take care of the strings. 

43
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,791
Come... I'll make you perform at the police station. 

44
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,291
 Sir... the strings... 

45
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,416
 Jim Morrison. 

46
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:05,833
 Who? 

47
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,166
 He was a great singer. 

48
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,833
The chicks would tear their clothes at the mere sight of him. 

49
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,083
 He stood before the crowd... 

50
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,541
 on the stage... 

51
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:18,541
 and raised his middle finger. 

52
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,333
 Just like this! 

53
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,041
 And the crowd went wild... 

54
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,250
they cheered and whistled... as if he had done something incredible. 

55
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,000
While here I was, respectfully singing... 

56
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,041
so that the people waiting for the bus would have a good time. 

57
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,333
And these no-good-cops began hitting me. 

58
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,708
 Very sad. 

59
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,625
 I mean, as if I were nothing. 

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,041
 Are you getting the samosas? 

61
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,000
 Right, continue to rip him off! 

62
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,250
There are a thousand criminals in Delhi... 

63
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,708
the cops should go after them. - Exactly! 

64
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,958
 Why this poor guy? 

65
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,416
 Jim Morrison... 

66
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,875
 Janardan Jakhar. 

67
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,916
 JM... 

68
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,333
 JJ. 

69
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
 Guys, he's a dead item! 

70
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,750
And is this the latest low class fashion? 

71
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,708
 To Be With You... 

72
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,083
 lead break. 

73
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,833
 Keep some style, dude! 

74
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,041
 Man, you're on stage! 

75
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,208
You should have some stage presence, right? 

76
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,916
 Attitude! 

77
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,958
 Like this... 

78
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:38,791
 Like this... 

79
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,791
As if you are going to blow everyone away! 

80
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,166
 What happened? 

81
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,833
 JJ? 

82
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,208
 My days aren't going well... 

83
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,083
Right now it's just a few bad days, son. 

84
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,666
If you don't stop your strumming and singing... 

85
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,375
then just see how your whole life goes bad. 

86
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,083
 This guy is very negative! 

87
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,333
 You loser! 

88
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,625
As if he will strike it rich with his father's business. 

89
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,500
I will never join the transport business. 

90
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,208
 Well then, get your degree and.. 

91
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,833
..become an advocate at the district court. 

92
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,833
 Trust me, that's the best you can do. 

93
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,750
 So he shouldn't even try? 

94
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,583
That rules out any chance he might have. 

95
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,333
 He doesn't stand a chance anyway. 

96
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,625
You don't become big, just by striking a pose with a guitar. 

97
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,833
But he has been playing the guitar since he was a kid! 

98
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,541
 Then why hasn't he tasted success yet? 

99
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,041
 Tell me. 

100
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,416
You mean... - Because he doesn't have it in him. 

101
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,541
 He doesn't have that quality. 

102
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,416
 And what kind of friends are you? 

103
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,833
 Just to eat the samosas he pays for? 

104
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,333
Hey! - Why don't you explain it to him? 

105
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,333
The sooner he understands, the better it is. 

106
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,708
 All that I 

107
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,250
 Wish to say 

108
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,250
 Is ruined by 

109
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,458
 Take down my number... 

110
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,291
 call me if I am selected. - Number? 

111
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,500
 Take it down... 

112
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,708
 I have your visiting card... 

113
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,166
Hindu College canteen... I'll call you. 

114
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,125
 What if I work really hard? 

115
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,750
 Even a donkey works hard. 

116
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,000
 Well then... 

117
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,833
 what do I lack? Tell me! 

118
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,416
 See... 

119
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,666
an artiste has a particular type of heart... 

120
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,833
 a particular personality. 

121
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,458
 And I don't? 

122
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,916
 You can't have it. 

123
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,291
 Your life hasn't been like that. 

124
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,458
 It's a different type of life... 

125
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,583
 that makes a person an artiste. 

126
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,458
 What type? 

127
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,041
 Take a look at anyone's life. 

128
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,708
 All these musicians, singers... 

129
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,541
 artists, painters, writers. 

130
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,208
 Take a look. 

131
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,625
 They all have one thing in common. 

132
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,416
 What? 

133
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,875
Which they all definitely have in some form or the other. 

134
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,166
 What is it, Khatana bhai? 

135
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,125
 Pain. 

136
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,625
 What? 

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,041
 Pain. 

138
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,416
 Sorrow, misery, tears... 

139
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,375
 Oh... is that right? 

140
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,500
 Until a person doesn't suffer... 

141
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,750
 he can never make it big. 

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,208
 And change your friend circle! 

143
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:27,750
 Pain. 

144
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,500
If you hang around with these losers, you're going nowhere. 

145
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,208
They've all gone through a lot of pain, Bittu. 

146
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,625
 They got hurt... 

147
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,083
 suffered, winced in pain. 

148
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,750
 Problems... 

149
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,541
 tragedies... 

150
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,583
 and me? 

151
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,375
 I haven't gone through anything. 

152
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,708
 I don't have even a single problem. 

153
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,416
 Never starved for food... 

154
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
 never struggled for anything... 

155
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,458
 even my parents are still alive. 

156
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:19,958
 Wasn't beaten as a child... 

157
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,500
 nor molested. 

158
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,125
I'm not even adopted, I'm my parent's biological child. 

159
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,666
 Never met with any big accident... 

160
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,666
 nor had a life-threatening disease. 

161
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,416
 Oh no! 

162
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,583
Music can only come from a broken heart. 

163
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,291
 When you're heart's broken... 

164
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,625
 shattered into tiny pieces... 

165
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,458
 that's when the music flows. 

166
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,416
 What have you ever been through? 

167
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,875
 Has your heart ever been broken? 

168
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,958
 Have you even been in love? 

169
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,291
If you have to think about it, then obviously not, you idiot! 

170
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
 True love. 

171
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,500
 Passion. 

172
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,541
 So then? 

173
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,291
 Where will the music come from? 

174
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,333
 You tell me. 

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,041
 Where will it come from? 

176
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,750
 Hey JJ! 

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,250
 You could've come along with us. 

178
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,833
 I'm heading to the Law FAC. 

179
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,500
I can't sit through a dance performance. 

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,166
 Who's going for the dance? 

181
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,583
 We're going there for the girl! 

182
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,000
 Go ahead, - Come on! 

183
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,583
 What's to see? 

184
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,125
As long as she is in Stephen's, she will always be number one. 

185
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,708
Come on! - Let's sit right in the front! 

186
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,708
 Sit here. - Sit! 

187
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,916
 Ladies and Gentlemen. 

188
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,041
 Welcome to 'Shut Up and Dance'. 

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,416
Presenting the first performance led by.. 

190
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,083
 Heer Kaul. 

191
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,750
It's true, what they say about Kashmir. 

192
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,208
 Heer from Kashmir? 

193
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:46,500
 If there's any heaven on earth... 

194
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,291
 it is right here... 

195
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,875
 it is right here... 

196
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,083
 within her clothes! 

197
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,958
 Over there, look! 

198
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,541
 How? 

199
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,375
I mean... what material did God use to make that. 

200
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,583
 Dude, the material is the same... 

201
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,291
Good morning. - but the engineering is mind blowing! 

202
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,250
 The car or the girl? 

203
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,541
 Both! 

204
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,000
 Watch carefully... 

205
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,041
 it's her last performance. 

206
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,833
Why is she in such a hurry to get married? 

207
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,208
 You have a problem? 

208
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,375
 Take it easy, buddy. 

209
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,375
 That's Heer. 

210
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,875
Watch her from a distance and be satisfied. 

211
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,166
 No way... 

212
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,500
 I should try my luck. 

213
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,916
 A lot of guys have tried... 

214
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,666
 and every one of them has failed. 

215
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,000
 She is a heart-breaker. 

216
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916
 Is it? - Yes. 

217
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,583
 Wow! 

218
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,000
 Okay JJ... 

219
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,166
 Jai Bajrang Bali! 

220
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,875
 He was so upset. 

221
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,875
 I know. 

222
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,041
But he said yesterday.. - What's going on? 

223
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,708
 Heer... 

224
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,083
 Hi. 

225
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,000
 Janardan... 

226
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,833
 JJ for short. 

227
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,708
 We need to talk. 

228
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,708
 About what? 

229
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,041
 Actually... you... 

230
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,750
 I think you are pretty cool. 

231
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,708
 I had to tell you this. 

232
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,583
 And you are quite hot too. 

233
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,083
Amazing combination, isn't it? Hot and cool at the same time. 

234
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,208
 Anything else? 

235
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,666
 Yes... 

236
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,583
 I love you. 

237
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,500
 Be my girlfriend. 

238
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,125
Can you see everyone is laughing at you? 

239
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,583
 All I can see is you. 

240
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,958
 You can see me, right? 

241
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,208
Then listen carefully to what I'm saying. 

242
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,208
 Bugger off! 

243
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,291
You and I will rock it, I'm telling you. 

244
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,500
 Think about it. 

245
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,833
 Hey... are you stupid? 

246
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,041
 No, only crazy for you baby. 

247
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,458
 Okay, enough. 

248
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,750
 Just get lost now! 

249
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,625
 Sure? 

250
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,875
 Am I sure? 

251
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,916
 One second, let me think... 

252
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,041
 Yes, I'm sure, you idiot! 

253
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
 Get lost! 

254
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,416
 You are breaking my heart, Heer. 

255
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,833
 Listen... - JJ... 

256
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,541
I don't want to see your face again, do you hear me? 

257
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:40,125
 Are you sure? 

258
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,791
 Bugger off! - Okay. 

259
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,833
 Okay. 

260
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,000
 What's he on, man? - Who is he? 

261
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,208
 Is he from Hindu? 

262
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,291
 Here, it's piping hot. 

263
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,125
Do you want me to eat two samosas in this much chutney? 

264
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,958
 Get me more. 

265
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,291
 You think this is a joke? 

266
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,458
 Khatana bhai... 

267
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,375
 I love her really. 

268
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,125
You can't imagine how it felt when she said... 

269
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,291
 'Burger off!' 

270
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
 I don't even know what that means. 

271
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,916
 You are such a shallow person. 

272
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,416
 Sheesh! 

273
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,000
If your heart were really broken you wouldn't be gorging on samosas! 

274
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,541
 or fighting for chutney! 

275
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,416
You can't eat a morsel for weeks on end. 

276
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,000
 There should be intensity in love... 

277
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,250
 There should be pain... 

278
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,750
 This isn't love, or heart break... 

279
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,666
 This is a cheap act, drama. 

280
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,041
 What should I do then? 

281
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,958
 What's the trick? 

282
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,500
 How do I... 

283
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,333
 Couldn't you wait at the station? 

284
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,208
 There was a lot to do? 

285
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,000
 He probably forgot... 

286
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,833
 Really? I don't forget anything. 

287
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,541
 Where are you lost? 

288
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,791
 Look at him... 

289
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,125
he doesn't give a damn about what you're saying! 

290
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,125
 I have a lot of stress, okay? 

291
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,583
 Don't scold me now. 

292
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,833
 So tell me when! 

293
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,166
 Give me an appointment. 

294
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,583
 Tuesday at eleven? 

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,458
 Or Wednesday at half past six? 

296
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,916
Let me know when I can scold you, I'll adjust my life accordingly. 

297
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,916
 Odysseus'... - Yes? 

298
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:22,708
 Heer. 

299
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,250
 If it's not critically important.. 

300
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,541
.. I suggest you wait till after the... 

301
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,875
 I want to propose to Heer. 

302
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,666
 Critically important. 

303
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,125
 Okay, I think you should leave. 

304
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,375
 This is true love, Madam. 

305
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,458
She has no right to dump me and marry some other guy... 

306
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,833
 just because he is rich! 

307
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,375
 What the hell? 

308
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,833
 What's your bloody problem? 

309
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,041
 Give me one chance, Heer. 

310
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,416
 I'll work really hard and... 

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,208
 I'll also become rich one day. 

312
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,458
 Listen, you jerk... 

313
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,000
 ..if I ever see you again... 

314
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,708
 you just see what I'll do to you. 

315
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,875
 What... what will you do? 

316
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,416
 I'll get your legs broken. 

317
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,875
I'll have you banned from entering campus... 

318
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,250
 I'll ruin you! 

319
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,208
 Is her anger for real? 

320
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,750
I don't think you've ever been in love. 

321
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,416
 It's different. 

322
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,083
 Driver, throw him out! - Yes, madam. 

323
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,041
But you will realize it sooner or later... 

324
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,166
 I know. - Throw him out! 

325
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,333
We just need to spend some quality time together. 

326
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,041
 Enough! Now see how I set you right. 

327
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,666
 You can take any action. 

328
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,041
 File a police compliant. 

329
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,416
 He's after her. 

330
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,708
 You know true love... 

331
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,916
 the intense kind... 

332
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,958
 ...it doesn't fear the world. 

333
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,833
 Not even the police! 

334
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,291
The poet Ghalib has explained it very well. 

335
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,125
Now I don't remember it, but I will ask and tell you. 

336
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,250
How will you ever know, if you don't give me a chance? 

337
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:57,083
Talking is important, try to understand. 

338
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:00,250
 Okay, let's talk right now. Come on. 

339
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,458
 Yes... tell me. 

340
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,833
 What happened? 

341
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,708
You wanted to talk, right? I'm listening. 

342
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:10,166
 Go on. 

343
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,958
 Well... I... 

344
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,125
 What? 

345
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,791
 We should give it a chance... 

346
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,500
 Okay, let's give it a chance. 

347
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,750
 Come on... give it a chance, come on! 

348
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,000
What are you thinking? Give it a chance. 

349
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,458
 What happened? 

350
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,333
The thing is... - Yes, what is the thing? 

351
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,541
Tell me... I really want to know what is the thing. 

352
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,166
 You see... - Yes? 

353
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,000
 I... - You... 

354
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,958
 come on! - Sorry... 

355
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,583
 Sorry. 

356
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,250
 I'm really... 

357
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,958
 I didn't think... 

358
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,125
 I'm sorry. 

359
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,666
 No, no. 

360
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,875
 He'll get hurt. 

361
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,625
 Hi. 

362
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:10,041
 What happened? 

363
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:14,375
 I'll be right back. - What's wrong? 

364
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,416
 Yes, old man... 

365
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,208
 What can I do for you? 

366
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,416
 How much for this? 

367
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,041
 I'll join you. - Bye. 

368
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,208
 Excuse me? 

369
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:40,333
 Hi. 

370
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:43,875
 Can I talk to you for a minute? 

371
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:51,250
 I'll be back... okay? 

372
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,708
 Come here. 

373
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,500
You don't have to be so nervous, every time you see me. 

374
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,625
 Okay? It's fine. 

375
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,083
 I'm not angry with you anymore. 

376
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,750
 So relax. 

377
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,208
 Thanks a lot. 

378
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,208
 Thank you very much. 

379
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:29,375
 And I'm really sorry. - Okay, bye. 

380
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,333
 And I don't love you or anything... 

381
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:32,916
 not even a little. 

382
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,875
Okay. - Everyone on campus says that... 

383
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,041
 Heer is gorgeous, she is hot. 

384
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:38,583
 Even my friends say that but... 

385
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,458
personally I don't think you are all that hot. 

386
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:42,958
 Or even cool. 

387
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,333
 Like I said? 

388
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,541
 I mean... 

389
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,833
 I don't mean you're ugly or anything. 

390
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,875
 You are beautiful... 

391
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,708
 it's not that... 

392
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,750
 but I... I am... 

393
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,666
 Then why were you chasing me? 

394
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,166
 Well... I... 

395
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,541
 I can't tell you, it's really crazy. 

396
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,500
 Well, everybody does crazy things. 

397
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,583
For you, bunking classes might be crazy... 

398
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,166
 or having pani puri. 

399
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,916
 I guess you do that and think... 

400
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,708
 'Oh my God, today was one crazy day!' 

401
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,416
 It's a little different for me. 

402
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,291
 So... 

403
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:28,833
 Okay, bye! 

404
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,375
 Hey! 

405
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,666
 What do you think I am? 

406
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,583
Oh no, I didn't mean it in any wrong way. 

407
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,250
 Then what did you mean? 

408
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,041
 I mean you are... 

409
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,625
 I mean... - What?! 

410
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,291
 You are... - What?! 

411
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,083
 Neat and clean! 

412
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:51,083
 Totally! 

413
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:52,916
 Nice. 

414
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,416
Sophisticated... from an elegant family. 

415
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,041
 Neat and clean? 

416
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,250
 And Hi-Fi! 

417
00:26:58,625 --> 00:26:59,750
 Hi-Fi! 

418
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,041
 There's this cinema theatre... 

419
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,958
 Amar Talkies in Old Delhi. 

420
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,708
 There's a film playing there... 

421
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,625
 Junglee Jawani [Wild Youth] 

422
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,625
 I'm going to see it. 

423
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,125
 What?! - Yeah. 

424
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,166
Do you even know what kind of a film it is? 

425
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:24,916
 I've seen the posters. 

426
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,666
 You still want to watch it? 

427
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 I've figured out the way... 

428
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:32,375
 I've also made the excuses. 

429
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,375
 You can't go there, by the way. 

430
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,583
 Of course, I am. 

431
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,208
 With whom? - On my own! 

432
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,666
 You are wicked! 

433
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,625
 By God! 

434
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,541
 Junglee Jawani [Wild Youth] 

435
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,791
 Sir, this CD has it all, take it sir. 

436
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,583
 Buy it, sir. 

437
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,833
 Hey Brother, come on! 

438
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,625
 Run run run... 

439
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,833
 Happy? 

440
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,000
 We should've stayed longer. 

441
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,375
You would've been raped if the lights had come on. 

442
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,458
 Wild Youth, Part Two. 

443
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,000
 Let's do another thing today. 

444
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,416
 By God, I'm scared to hear it. 

445
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:25,291
 Where can we get some cheap liquor? 

446
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,958
 You're Heer, right? 

447
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:30,458
Let me look at you. - I want to drink, where can we get it? 

448
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,083
Are you the Heer Kaul from Stephen's college? 

449
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:35,333
 That's enough! I want to drink! 

450
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:36,958
 Cheers! 

451
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:41,833
 Is it good? - It's very bad! 

452
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,583
 Why aren't you drinking? 

453
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,125
 I am. 

454
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:50,333
 Let me see... drink! 

455
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,083
 Yuck! 

456
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,083
 It's so bitter! 

457
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,458
 How do people drink it? 

458
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,625
 Don't you drink? 

459
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,583
 I sprinkle some on my face and... 

460
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,250
 a little around my collar. 

461
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,791
I throw the rest away and act as if I'm sloshed. 

462
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:13,416
You're the first one who has caught me. 

463
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,750
 Then you can't pretend with me. 

464
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,791
 With me, you have to drink. 

465
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,125
 Go for it, cheers! 

466
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,833
 One more... - You are so... 

467
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,666
 Cheers! - Jai Bajrang Bali! 

468
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,583
 I'm getting married. 

469
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,916
 The entire University knows. 

470
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:41,583
 Really? 

471
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,000
 You are drunk! 

472
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,291
 Just two months to go. 

473
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,375
 I've heard you've hit it big! 

474
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,000
 Paris? - Prague. 

475
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,208
 And once I'm married... 

476
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,250
 no 'Wild Youth' and... 

477
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,208
 no cheap liquor. 

478
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,625
 Then, I'll be a lady. 

479
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,583
 Lady... neat and clean. 

480
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,166
 Oh... 

481
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,291
so that's why you want to do all these cheap things before marriage. 

482
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,583
 You are not as stupid as you look! 

483
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,500
Even you don't look as wicked as you are. 

484
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,500
You want to go back home or get some more cheap thrills? 

485
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,458
 Lots! 

486
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:26,333
 I want to do a lot of cheap things. 

487
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,041
 I have to perform huge feats! 

488
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,958
 but where's the time, my friend? 

489
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,500
 Where is the time? 

490
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,333
 So what if we don't have time today... 

491
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,000
 we have time tomorrow! 

492
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,083
 You are a genius! 

493
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:40,958
 How did you fail in B.A. pass? 

494
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,083
 And day after! 

495
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,958
 And the day after that... 

496
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,500
 And time demands that... 

497
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,041
 You make your list! 

498
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,666
Make a list of all the little worms inside you... 

499
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,291
I swear, before you get married, we'll kill each one of them. 

500
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,708
 Promise? - I swear! 

501
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,625
 Anyway, my image is ruined before you. 

502
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,375
 Right, you're completely exposed now! 

503
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,291
 In that case I'll get the list ready. 

504
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:09,541
 You better! - Okay. 

505
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,500
 Okay. - Okay. 

506
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,041
 Hello Sir... - Madam. 

507
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,291
 Everything okay? 

508
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:19,833
 How are you? 

509
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,666
 See you. - Bye. 

510
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,208
 I spin a yarn 

511
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,958
 Of you, I spin a yarn 

512
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,458
 Of you - Come on. 

513
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,208
 All night I spin a yarn 

514
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:50,000
 Spin a yarn 

515
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,541
 All night I spin a yarn 

516
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,291
 Spin a yarn 

517
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:58,041
 All night I spin a yarn 

518
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,833
 All day I pass in thinking 

519
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:03,500
 It's for you that I live and die 

520
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,208
 Ting ling ling ling 

521
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,916
 Ting ling ling ling 

522
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,625
 Ting ling ling ling 

523
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:14,041
 Ting ling ling ling 

524
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,041
 Ting ling ling ling 

525
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,375
 Ting ling ling ling 

526
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,625
 This friend of yours is quite unique. 

527
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,708
 At least you shouldn't complain. 

528
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,166
 Aunt. - Should I change it? 

529
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,750
 Switch it on. 

530
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:37,625
Two minutes! I'll go on my bike and get the Disprin. 

531
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:38,791
 Poor guy! 

532
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:42,125
 Why 'poor guy'? He enjoys it too! 

533
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,125
 Why are you cheating? 

534
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,000
 Why are you using the shortcuts? 

535
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,208
 Now you're dead, Mandy! 

536
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,583
 No way! It's you who will die! 

537
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,166
 You should invite him for the wedding. 

538
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,125
 He comes shopping for the wedding... 

539
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,708
 of course he'll come for the wedding. 

540
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,916
 Hey! 

541
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,208
 Wear this for your husband. 

542
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,625
 His tongue will touch the floor! 

543
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,833
 Let me see... 

544
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,666
 move your hand. 

545
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,791
 Nice. 

546
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,458
 A little lower, show a little more. 

547
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,458
 Lower it some more, what's the matter? 

548
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,500
 Fine? - Firecracker! 

549
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,250
 His body will catch fire. 

550
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,166
 His 'Wild Youth' will arise. 

551
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,041
 Listen... I can't make it right now. 

552
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,958
But Khatana bhai has kept the Platinum Music guys waiting... 

553
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,083
 in his canteen. 

554
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,000
Tell Khatana bhai that you couldn't find me. 

555
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,208
 What? - And listen... 

556
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:48,875
..don't come looking for me for the next few days. 

557
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm going away for a while and I've made excuses at home. 

558
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,333
 Where are you going? 

559
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,708
 Kashmir. - Kashmir? 

560
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,500
 This one. 

561
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,583
 Thank God! 

562
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,708
 I was getting so bored here. 

563
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,333
There's nothing to do at your own wedding. 

564
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:07,541
 Come on. 

565
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,166
 Let it be, he'll take it. 

566
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,541
 Come... 

567
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:15,041
 Everything is set. 

568
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,291
 Come on. 

569
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,708
 Not right now, I'm the bride! 

570
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:24,708
 Sunrise? 

571
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:26,458
 Done! 

572
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,625
 Think you can make it? 

573
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,583
 Who has the guts to dare stop me? 

574
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,333
 Nobody here knows the real you. 

575
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:35,708
 Only you know it! 

576
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,291
 Don't tell anyone. 

577
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:39,541
 Okay! - Okay. 

578
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,458
 Ting ling ling ling 

579
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,000
 Ting ling ling ling 

580
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:54,000
 Ting ling ling ling 

581
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,458
 Ting ling ling ling 

582
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,416
Keep dancing around, keep skipping around 

583
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,833
 I keep roaming around 

584
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,875
 I cross limits 

585
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,833
 gust of breeze, I plunder myself 

586
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:24,000
 I plunder myself 

587
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,541
 gust of breeze, I plunder myself 

588
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:30,625
 Hold this. - Yes. 

589
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,000
 Come on JJ. 

590
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,166
 Hi. - Hi. 

591
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,208
 Welcome... 

592
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,458
 Hi. - Hi. 

593
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:39,916
 Guys, remember him? 

594
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,250
 He's also here? 

595
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,208
 He's Jordan. - Jordan? 

596
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:46,791
Great combination, isn't it? Short and cool at the same time? 

597
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,875
 Hi Jordan... 

598
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,458
 Aman. 

599
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,333
 Jordan. 

600
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,625
 Hi, I'm Mahi. 

601
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:54,958
 Jordan. 

602
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,416
 Jordan. 

603
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:07,041
 This face like the bright moon 

604
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,375
 This golden hew of hair 

605
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,500
 These eyes like the blue lake 

606
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,458
 There is a deep mystery in them 

607
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:17,541
What praise should I give to - Amazing. 

608
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:21,708
 He who has created you? 

609
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:25,916
 What praise should I give to 

610
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,125
 He who has created you? 

611
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:34,375
 What praise should I give to 

612
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:38,375
 He who has created you? 

613
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:42,708
 What praise should I give to 

614
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,833
 He who has created you? 

615
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,708
 Ting ling ling ling 

616
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,958
 Ting ling ling ling 

617
00:38:01,416 --> 00:38:04,083
 Ting ling ling ling 

618
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,458
 Ting ling ling ling 

619
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,500
 Hi. 

620
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:45,958
 Put this up. 

621
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,791
 Properly. That side too. 

622
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,125
 Okay. 

623
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:08,291
 Jordan... can you hug me? 

624
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,041
 Now? 

625
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,791
 Are you in a hurry? 

626
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,291
 No. 

627
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,875
 Give me a proper hug... 

628
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,041
 tightly. 

629
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,500
 Is this okay? 

630
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,208
 Okay. 

631
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:49,416
 I should leave. 

632
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,333
 They're probably looking for me. 

633
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,041
 Very nice. 

634
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,333
 What? 

635
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:35,875
 What? 

636
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,541
 Why are you getting so sentimental? 

637
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:40,958
 I'm getting married. 

638
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,291
If it's bothering you so much, don't get married. 

639
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,666
 And then? 

640
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,583
 The back door is open... 

641
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:48,000
 run away. 

642
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,583
 Come. 

643
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,958
Tell me something... - Don't ask me anything... 

644
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:55,708
 or else I'll tell the truth. 

645
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:59,500
 So say it, what's stopping you? 

646
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,625
 Yes. 

647
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,083
 Yes, what? 

648
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,333
 How do I look? 

649
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,333
 The college guys were right. 

650
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:13,791
 You look hot. 

651
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,000
The bride matches the standard of the wedding, right? 

652
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,958
 Do you know... 

653
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,916
 the guests at the wedding... 

654
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,208
 fantasize about the bride at night. 

655
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,541
 Will you also fantasize about me? 

656
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,916
 Listen... 

657
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,916
you haven't fallen in love with me or anything, right? 

658
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,083
 When are you coming to visit me? 

659
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,208
 Prague? 

660
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,916
 I've never even been to Nepal. 

661
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,833
 But you'll have to come to Prague. 

662
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,375
 Okay, done. 

663
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,458
 So... 

664
00:41:52,541 --> 00:41:55,708
 I'll go first. Then, you come later. 

665
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,833
Together we'll do a lot of cheap things in Prague, okay? 

666
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,208
 Is this plan okay? 

667
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,750
 Or should we run away now? 

668
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,833
 I've taken flight again 

669
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,333
 I've let go of the world below 

670
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:31,750
 And I submit myself to you, O wind 

671
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,000
 Now people are far away 

672
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,541
 Miles away are these valleys 

673
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:44,625
Slowly each cloud comes to touch my body 

674
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:50,708
 But no cloud is able to drench me 

675
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,250
 Never stopped at any place 

676
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:59,166
 Never even met myself 

677
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,375
 I may complain but upset I'm not 

678
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:03,583
 Cities and villages appear the same 

679
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,541
People and their names all seem the same 

680
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:17,250
 I've taken flight again 

681
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,333
 Dreams, like dust, reappear in my eyes 

682
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:28,416
 No matter how much I brush them away 

683
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,833
 So many dreams 

684
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:40,250
 I have broken and left behind 

685
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:45,833
Yet why do they return and take me away on their wings 

686
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,250
 Over branches and leaves 

687
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,166
 By my side they travel door to door 

688
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,208
 Sometimes desert, sometimes rain 

689
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:03,208
 Like a demon, I die a thousand times 

690
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,208
 Over branches and leaves 

691
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,125
Sometimes day is night, sometimes day is day 

692
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,291
 What is real, what is illusion 

693
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:17,416
 Almighty - Almighty 

694
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,708
Here and there and scattered, who knows 

695
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:26,666
Maybe the breeze will take me in your direction 

696
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:31,166
 Your thoughts pull me 

697
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,000
 Towards you 

698
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:01,333
I keep flying about in these colourful illusions 

699
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:05,208
 Keep flying... 

700
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:09,208
I keep flying about in these colourful illusions 

701
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:12,750
 Keep flying... 

702
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,291
 Tell me... 

703
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:47,500
has the media stooped so low that just about anything makes the news? 

704
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:51,250
You pick any loser and make him a star? 

705
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,333
 Who is this Jordan? 

706
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,125
 What's his claim to fame? 

707
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:57,083
Sir, he is an artiste with your Platinum Music. 

708
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:58,708
He is not an artiste of Platinum Music. 

709
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,791
He sang some songs in the 'Sheher' album. 

710
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:03,833
And you guys are trying to make him a star. 

711
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,041
 Trust me... 

712
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,500
 I'm not his fan. 

713
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,166
 It's just my job... 

714
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,666
But it's not my job to sing his false praises. 

715
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,875
 Take it off! 

716
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:15,208
The packaging for the episode is ready. 

717
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:19,416
So get your hands on anything you can about him and put it together. 

718
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,250
 He doesn't live here anymore. 

719
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,708
 It's been two years... 

720
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:27,208
 But can I at least talk to his family? 

721
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,791
 He has no family here. 

722
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,833
 Please don't call again. 

723
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:32,875
 I can't do it, Mohit. 

724
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,125
 Sheena get real. 

725
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,666
We need four such interviews every month for the Rising Star. 

726
00:46:38,166 --> 00:46:39,375
 Let go of your ego. 

727
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,791
Be shameless and get the material ready. 

728
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:45,250
No, actually he is not in touch with any of us. 

729
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:49,000
After college what happened to him... no one really knows. 

730
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:51,333
Any other lead? Any one special from those days? 

731
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,125
 Please think... 

732
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:59,208
Jordan always had a keen interest in music. 

733
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:04,208
And I often tried to encourage the musician in him. 

734
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,916
 He was a fountain of talent. 

735
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:12,708
Apart from being very talented, he was also a good human being. 

736
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:17,791
The kids want to know when this interview will go on air. 

737
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,250
 It won't come on TV. 

738
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,375
 Why not? 

739
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:24,583
Because I don't have any material on this Jordan. 

740
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,916
 But I just said so much. 

741
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,541
 But all lies? 

742
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:29,875
 Correct? 

743
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:31,333
 Why? 

744
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:32,958
 My questions are simple. 

745
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,125
 You knew Jordan well, right? 

746
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,333
So, why don't you just tell me the truth? 

747
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:38,791
 You are getting very angry. 

748
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:40,000
 No, I really want to know. 

749
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:42,000
Now the camera isn't rolling, so tell me. 

750
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,041
 Who is this Jordan, after all? 

751
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:46,750
 You know... 

752
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,041
 there are these people... 

753
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,458
 who are always lost. 

754
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:53,541
 You understand, right? 

755
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:54,958
 I don't understand at all. 

756
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,166
 For example, Platinum Music, okay? 

757
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,541
There was a time when he would've given his life.. 

758
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,416
 ..even to talk to the clerks there. 

759
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:04,916
 That was his craze. 

760
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,875
 Then one day I told him... 

761
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:08,916
 Hey... 

762
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,750
 Prince of music! 

763
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:12,416
 Where have you been? 

764
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,583
 I was... 

765
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,458
The Platinum Music guys were looking for you. 

766
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,375
 Dilip Menon, remember him? 

767
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,000
 I'll call you, Khatana bhai. 

768
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,625
 I'll see you tomorrow. 

769
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,250
 What's got into you? 

770
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,708
 Don't you want to be Jim Morrison? 

771
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:25,916
 I'll be him, Khatana bhai. 

772
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,166
 I'll be him tomorrow. 

773
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,791
Two weeks later the Platinum Music agents came here looking for him. 

774
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:36,458
I offered them four samosas and made them wait. 

775
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,375
 I even sent someone to his place... 

776
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:43,000
Tell Khatana bhai that you couldn't find me. - What? - And listen... 

777
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:44,666
 don't come here looking for me. 

778
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:46,791
I'm going away for a while and I've made excuses at home. 

779
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:48,000
 Where are you going? 

780
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,416
 Kashmir. 

781
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,625
 Why Kashmir? 

782
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,833
 I don't know. 

783
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,291
 But when he returned he was caught. 

784
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,083
 His brothers yelled at him... 

785
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:59,458
mother cried her eyes out, you know, full social drama. 

786
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,916
 I told you a million times... 

787
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,125
 We sweat it out like dogs... 

788
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,708
 while he plays the guitar! 

789
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,708
 Just a minute... Gurmeet! Who is Heer? 

790
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,041
 What's your scene with her? - Nothing. 

791
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:09,791
 You're lying. Another lie. 

792
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:13,000
Tell me. Get his guitar... where's the bloody guitar? 

793
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:15,458
If there's nothing, why did you attend her wedding? 

794
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:16,833
 Get his guitar... 

795
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,250
Why did you go there? - Where's the guitar? 

796
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:23,791
 What's up, Khatana bhai? 

797
00:49:24,291 --> 00:49:25,416
 How are things? 

798
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,875
 Where the hell have you been? 

799
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,250
 You've stopped coming to college. 

800
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,125
 You know, it's not that bad after all. 

801
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:32,791
There's an AC and I don't have a lot of work. 

802
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,833
I have installed video games on the TV. 

803
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,375
 Khatana bhai ... 

804
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:39,041
there's a whole world inside these video games. 

805
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,333
Didn't he say he would never get into the family business? 

806
00:49:45,291 --> 00:49:46,375
 What about music? 

807
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:47,875
 He gave it up. 

808
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,375
 And then? 

809
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:51,166
And one day it was the same thing all over again. 

810
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,916
 Same brothers, same mother... 

811
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,375
 the same social drama. 

812
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,250
 Tell me... now! - Let go of my collar! 

813
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,541
Confess you stole the money and I'll let go. 

814
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,666
Five hundred thousand rupees? Just vanished into thin air? 

815
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,000
 Why would he steal his own money? 

816
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:06,041
 You won't confess? 

817
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,916
I've been telling you I didn't steal it! 

818
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,916
 All you want to do is beat me up! 

819
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,291
 Probably someone else stole it. 

820
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,916
Shut up! But he is in charge of that place. 

821
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,500
 The key is always in the drawer. 

822
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:16,708
 Everybody knows that... 

823
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:17,875
 ask your staff. 

824
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:20,458
And Bhabhi, you don't have to touch me to console me. 

825
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:21,666
 I've told you a thousand times .. 

826
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,833
.. that I can hear you even from a distance. 

827
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:25,500
There's no need to stick like chewing-gum all the time. 

828
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:34,083
 This has happened even before me. 

829
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:35,833
I've always heard that the warehouse was... 

830
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:45,083
 Can I stay here for a few days? 

831
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,041
 So he stayed at your place? 

832
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,875
 He still lives at my place. 

833
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,083
 Relax... have some tea-coffee... 

834
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:05,541
So the night he was thrown out, he came to your house? 

835
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,750
 Not that night... two months later. 

836
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:09,416
 Two months later? 

837
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:10,958
 More or less. 

838
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:13,500
 So then where were you for two months? 

839
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:18,291
 Bloody idiot, where were you? 

840
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:19,791
 At a shrine... 

841
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:21,791
 The shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin. 

842
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,250
 Two months? 

843
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,500
 I tried to go home... 

844
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,500
 three times. 

845
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,583
 But they refused to take me back. 

846
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,333
 So what did you do at the shrine? 

847
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:32,875
 Nothing... 

848
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,041
 What do you mean 'nothing'? 

849
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:36,125
You must've done something for two months! 

850
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:43,250
 Nizamuddin Aulia -Nizamuddin Master 

851
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:51,458
 Nizamuddin Aulia -Nizamuddin Master 

852
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,333
 Lift your foot 

853
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,583
 Cross over 

854
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,541
 Move into emptiness 

855
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:14,125
 Your beloved's home 

856
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:17,875
 Is empty without you 

857
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:21,416
 Move into emptiness 

858
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:25,625
 Is empty without you 

859
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,708
 Move into emptiness 

860
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,666
 Painter 

861
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,416
 Painter 

862
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:53,583
 Painter 

863
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,166
 Painter 

864
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,291
 "Be" And There Was 

865
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:15,583
 "Be" And There Was 

866
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:21,250
 "Be" And There Was 

867
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:26,500
 "Be" And There Was 

868
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:32,208
 When even nothingness was not 

869
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:37,541
 He alone existed 

870
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:43,208
 When even nothingness was not 

871
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:48,708
 He alone existed 

872
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:54,041
 Who dwells in me, who dwells in you 

873
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:57,291
 He is the Lord, He is the illusion 

874
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:04,833
 Who dwells in me, who dwells in you 

875
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:08,750
 He is the Lord, He is the illusion 

876
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:14,458
 "Be" And There Was 

877
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:21,208
 "God is great." 

878
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:43,250
 Was Painter Paint my body, my mind 

879
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:54,375
Take as payment My body, my mind Painter Paint my body, my mind 

880
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:59,833
 Take as payment My body, my mind 

881
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:02,750
 Bright morning rains on my body 

882
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:05,291
 In the dark night Your lamp burns 

883
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:13,708
 Bright morning rains on my body 

884
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:16,416
 In the dark night Your lamp burns 

885
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:24,000
The drop that I got from your doorstep, O Lord Lord 

886
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:30,000
 "Be" And There Was 

887
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,750
 "Be" And There Was 

888
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,666
 "Be" And There Was 

889
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,041
 "Be" And There Was 

890
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:43,000
 "Be" And There Was 

891
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:47,166
 "Be" And There Was 

892
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:54,000
 When even nothingness was not 

893
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:59,416
 He alone existed 

894
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,000
 "Be" And There Was 

895
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:08,625
 "God is great." 

896
00:56:08,708 --> 00:56:14,000
 "God is merciful." 

897
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:18,958
 "We bow to you." 

898
00:56:19,041 --> 00:56:25,125
 "We bow to you." 

899
00:56:25,208 --> 00:56:31,708
 Do this favour to me, O Lord 

900
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:37,875
 I request you, set me 

901
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,833
 Free from myself 

902
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:51,375
 Let me see myself 

903
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:54,041
 Set me 

904
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:58,000
 Free from myself 

905
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:06,958
 Free from myself 

906
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,041
 These doubts of my mind 

907
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:15,750
 These weak actions of mine 

908
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:18,458
 Are taking me where 

909
00:57:18,541 --> 00:57:21,166
 I don't even know 

910
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,125
 You dwell in me 

911
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:26,750
 Where have you've brought me 

912
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,500
 I dwell in you 

913
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:32,208
 I have followed you 

914
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:35,000
 I'm just your shadow 

915
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:38,000
 You created me 

916
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,333
 The world pushed me away 

917
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,166
 You embraced me 

918
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,833
 You are the truth, O Lord 

919
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:49,041
 You are the truth 

920
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:56,666
 "Be" And There Was 

921
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:01,250
 "Be" And There Was 

922
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:07,833
 "When there's no other way to go." 

923
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,958
 "You showed us the way." 

924
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,708
 Work faster. 

925
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:18,041
 Here. Distribute these as well. 

926
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,583
 Here. 

927
00:58:29,416 --> 00:58:32,291
 "Glory to Mother Goddess." 

928
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,125
 "Glory to thee." 

929
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:37,833
 "Glory to Mother Goddess." 

930
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:40,291
 "Glory to thee." 

931
00:58:40,375 --> 00:58:42,791
 "I come seeking refuge." 

932
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:45,375
 "I don't know what to ask for." 

933
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:48,250
 "You get rid of everyone's sorrows." 

934
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,208
 "So I know." 

935
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:51,916
 "Everyone say." 

936
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
 "Glory to Mother Goddess." 

937
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,916
 "Glory to thee." 

938
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,708
 "Glory to Mother Goddess." 

939
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:02,333
 "Glory to Mother Goddess." 

940
00:59:02,416 --> 00:59:05,083
 "Glory to thee." 

941
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,791
 "Glory to Mother Goddess." 

942
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,583
 Okay, cut! 

943
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:29,750
 You're missing a beat. 

944
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,500
 Can you hear the pilot track? - Yes. 

945
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,708
 Increase the volume in the cans. 

946
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,583
 Okay, take. 

947
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,000
 Cut it Cut it Cut it ! 

948
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:44,375
 Hear it once again. 

949
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:49,208
 Take... 

950
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,833
 Cut... once again... 

951
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,000
 Cut! 

952
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,083
 Cut... 

953
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:04,041
 Cut Cut Cut... 

954
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,125
 take a break. 

955
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:08,458
 Sir, would you like some tea? 

956
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,583
 Let's record his voice first. 

957
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:13,250
 I'm in your city 

958
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,875
 Please come and meet me 

959
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:18,583
 I'm in your city 

960
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:21,166
 Please come and meet me 

961
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:24,041
 Don't give me anything but 

962
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:26,958
 Come and take my heart Darling 

963
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,666
 What is it? 

964
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,833
Are you playing the song or are you playing with the song? 

965
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:33,208
 It's very simple. 

966
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:37,000
Posted a letter telling you I am coming to your home 

967
01:00:39,833 --> 01:00:45,500
I even sent you an E-mail on your ID - Cut it. 

968
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,708
 You're not listening. 

969
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:50,083
 I can't do this, okay? 

970
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:52,416
I don't know why you were looking for me. 

971
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,625
 I can't sing... 

972
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,000
 I don't have it in me. 

973
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,458
 You are right. 

974
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:59,000
Were you singing out of tune purposely? 

975
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:00,416
 Why would I do that? 

976
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,291
 Even I could figure out the tune... 

977
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:03,750
 and you couldn't? 

978
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:14,541
 And then somehow... 

979
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,375
 a miracle happened. 

980
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,666
 Ustad ji... 

981
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:22,041
 Is that him? 

982
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:26,958
 Come in. 

983
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:28,958
 Sit here. 

984
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,166
 I've seen you before. 

985
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:36,291
 Do you know where? 

986
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,791
 At the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin. 

987
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:41,291
 That was nothing... 

988
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:54,208
 I've also seen you before. 

989
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,875
 On TV. 

990
01:01:58,208 --> 01:02:00,125
 You play that... that thing... 

991
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:04,000
 Hey! 

992
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:05,958
 This is Ustad Jameel Khan. 

993
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:07,875
 Padma Bhushan. [Indian Civilian Award] 

994
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:10,000
 Do you know what Padma Bhushan means? 

995
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:12,416
 Shehnai. 

996
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,125
 Sorry. 

997
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,875
 I know you are a well known... 

998
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:18,750
 legend. 

999
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,875
 But classical music... 

1000
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,708
you see, I don't understand it too much. 

1001
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,166
 I get bored. 

1002
01:02:28,083 --> 01:02:30,375
Why do they play the same tune over and over... 

1003
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:31,875
 Everybody's heard it... 

1004
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:33,583
 move on, play something else. 

1005
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,958
 He is a big animal... 

1006
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:44,375
 he won't fit into your small cage. 

1007
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:47,791
 He will create his own music. 

1008
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,791
Ustadji, you can't be serious... this guy... 

1009
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:51,708
 He is something else. 

1010
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:53,791
 God has blessed him. 

1011
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,041
 He has His grace. 

1012
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,333
 Trust me... 

1013
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,916
 take a chance on him. 

1014
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:03,000
 You will make a fortune. 

1015
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:22,083
 Hello... 

1016
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,583
 Hi. 

1017
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,958
Khatana bhai said you want to interview me. 

1018
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,625
 Jordan... 

1019
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,708
 Tell me something. 

1020
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,625
Why does Mr. Dhingra have a problem with you? 

1021
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,791
 Come on, I know there's something. 

1022
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,625
 Come in... 

1023
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:47,041
 Press harder. 

1024
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:51,958
 Happy birthday. 

1025
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,250
 Today you've been born again. 

1026
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:58,958
Starting today you are a Platinum Music artiste. 

1027
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:05,166
I heard... your songs in the 'Sheher' album... 

1028
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,916
 I liked them... 

1029
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,416
 Now you will have your own album... 

1030
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,708
 full solo. 

1031
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,333
 Full solo. 

1032
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,583
 Congratulations. 

1033
01:04:17,416 --> 01:04:21,333
 Now you need to learn to... be a star. 

1034
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,541
 The music doesn't really matter. 

1035
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,208
 Lot's of people play music. 

1036
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,041
 But everything is image. 

1037
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,416
 Image is everything. 

1038
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,583
 Image is everything. 

1039
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:31,750
 Everything is image. 

1040
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:33,000
 Image is everything. 

1041
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:36,375
Everything is image. - Bloody idiot! I'll beat you. 

1042
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,583
 Leave my hand. Do you want to kill me. 

1043
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:45,583
 These days nobody buys music. 

1044
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,583
 People buy an image... 

1045
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:49,833
 a brand. 

1046
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,666
 Just remember that... 

1047
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,875
 from today you're not a musician. 

1048
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,375
 What are you? 

1049
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,625
 What are you? 

1050
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:08,541
 Stop it! 

1051
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,875
 Sorry, sir. 

1052
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,333
 Stop it! 

1053
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,458
 The massage is over. 

1054
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:26,041
So that's why you are not going to Prague! 

1055
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:27,833
 Ready! 

1056
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:30,333
Your name didn't feature in the Eurojam list... 

1057
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:31,791
 I was really surprised. 

1058
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:35,125
 Don't you know about Eurojam? 

1059
01:05:35,666 --> 01:05:36,833
It's a tie-up between Platinum Music .. 

1060
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:37,958
 .. and the Czech Republic government. 

1061
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:40,875
Dhingra is taking five Indian musicians to Europe. 

1062
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:42,958
 Ready? 

1063
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,125
 Ready, ready... 

1064
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,791
 Just a second, I need to make a call. 

1065
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,041
 Sure. 

1066
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:48,750
 Switch off the microphone. 

1067
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:53,458
 Go see where he is gone. 

1068
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,583
 Stars! 

1069
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:07,583
What are you looking at, let's pack up. 

1070
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:11,500
 Mr. Dhingra... 

1071
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:12,875
 take me to Europe. 

1072
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,166
 How did you get inside? 

1073
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,708
 I'll sign your contract... 

1074
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:18,041
 I'll do anything you ask me to. 

1075
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,041
 Take me to Europe. 

1076
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,125
 Don't feel like laughing today? 

1077
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,500
 No, sir. 

1078
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:29,958
 Not even a little bit? 

1079
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,625
 Come here... - I want to go, sir. 

1080
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,500
 Why do you want to go? 

1081
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:39,166
 What's the real reason? - Sir... 

1082
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,083
 I'm willing to sign anything today. 

1083
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,375
 Just take me to Europe! 

1084
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:50,125
 You will sign a special contract. 

1085
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:53,375
As you wish. The clauses will be severe, everyone here is a witness. 

1086
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:54,958
They are also witness to what I've said, sir. 

1087
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,041
 Anything you say. 

1088
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:16,125
 Like anything? - Heer! All done? 

1089
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:17,583
 Are you buying something? 

1090
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,875
Why don't you ever buy something for yourself? 

1091
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:21,583
 I should like something. 

1092
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:24,166
 So why don't you ever like anything? 

1093
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:27,000
Come here... the scarves here are lovely. 

1094
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:28,333
 I have an appointment. 

1095
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,375
You enjoy going to the doctor, don't you? 

1096
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,083
 Why are you going now? 

1097
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,958
 All your tests are negative. 

1098
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,250
 Psychiatrist. - You know... 

1099
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,375
 I can be your psychiatrist. 

1100
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,583
 You need something to keep you busy. 

1101
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:42,916
 Like a job. 

1102
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,083
 The doctor says the same thing. 

1103
01:07:44,166 --> 01:07:45,708
You were a superhot bombshell in Delhi... 

1104
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:46,875
 super busy. 

1105
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:49,708
Here you've got nothing to do, that's why you feel down. 

1106
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,916
 I'm sorry... 

1107
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,083
 I don't know why... 

1108
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:53,416
 You don't have to be sorry. 

1109
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:54,833
 God, Heer! 

1110
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,375
 I've troubled everyone... 

1111
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:57,583
 I know... 

1112
01:07:57,666 --> 01:07:58,750
 You know what? 

1113
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:00,625
 You should go see a psychiatrist. 

1114
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:03,166
 Here you are. - Bye. - Bye. 

1115
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,166
 Hey 'Wild Youth'! 

1116
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:36,458
 Here I am... 

1117
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:38,791
 in Prague. 

1118
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:41,916
 Let's get some cheap thrills. 

1119
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,291
 Come on! 

1120
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:51,583
 I have an appointment... 

1121
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:54,625
 with the psychiatrist. 

1122
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:56,000
 So you've finally gone mad? 

1123
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,500
 I can't come right now. 

1124
01:08:58,166 --> 01:08:59,291
 I need to go. 

1125
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:00,666
 I'm not keeping too well. 

1126
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,041
 But we'll meet soon. Tomorrow, okay? 

1127
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:05,791
 I'll take you for lunch. 

1128
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,166
 At some fancy restaurant. 

1129
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,500
 Where are you staying... 

1130
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:15,500
When did you arrive and what are you doing here? 

1131
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:19,541
 Come let's go. 

1132
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:28,125
 Please take the car home. 

1133
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,250
 I can't believe you are here! 

1134
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:55,750
 Welcome to Prague! 

1135
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:05,000
 Ting ling ling ling 

1136
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:07,625
 Ting ling ling ling 

1137
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:10,416
 Ting ling ling ling 

1138
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,083
 Ting ling ling ling 

1139
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,041
 I shouldn't be drinking... 

1140
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:30,750
 Says the drunkard! - Cheers! - Cheers! 

1141
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:35,708
 That burns! 

1142
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:37,833
 When did you start drinking? 

1143
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,500
 Just now! 

1144
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:44,041
Let's have another one! Really? - Yes! - Okay. - Cheers! 

1145
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,625
 Let's make a list. 

1146
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:04,958
 Strip show! 

1147
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,083
 Female or male? 

1148
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:07,333
 Both! 

1149
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,458
 Next. 

1150
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,041
 Red light district. 

1151
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:14,291
 Those cheap pubs. 

1152
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:18,000
Those cheap discotheques with the tacky lights... 

1153
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,666
 and shady people. 

1154
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:22,833
 You'll dance for them? 

1155
01:11:22,916 --> 01:11:24,041
 Yes! 

1156
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,333
 Naughty girl! 

1157
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,375
 Next! 

1158
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:02,333
 Feet are decked with wheels 

1159
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:05,541
 Have spun the skies round and round 

1160
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,916
 This tale I've heard 

1161
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:10,875
 That the queen roams around 

1162
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:13,041
 On her pretty fair feet 

1163
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,208
 One blink of an eye 

1164
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:16,666
 And the queen was gone 

1165
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:18,291
 Then would return 

1166
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,000
With 12 pairs of shoes worn out in a day 

1167
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:21,750
 The king's temper flew 

1168
01:12:21,833 --> 01:12:23,375
 A spy he called 

1169
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:26,166
 What is this mystery? 

1170
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,041
 Find out 

1171
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:34,250
 Where does she go? 

1172
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,291
 The spy followed the queen 

1173
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:44,708
 And saw her at night 

1174
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:49,250
 Going into hell 

1175
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,250
 Alright. 

1176
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:03,208
 ho... Flames blaze 

1177
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:04,916
 ho... Queen mesmerized 

1178
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,500
 ho... Wild dancing 

1179
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,083
 ho... Everyone poisonous 

1180
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,875
 ho... Spy shocked 

1181
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:11,291
 ho... Sneaked out 

1182
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:14,208
 ho... He told the king 

1183
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:17,125
 The queen vanished into thin air 

1184
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,500
 She vanished into thin air 

1185
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,875
 Danced like a dervish 

1186
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,916
 Left beloved and guard 

1187
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:25,083
 Swirled and twirled 

1188
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:27,583
 Pretty feet never stopped 

1189
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:30,416
 Had no shame 

1190
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:34,083
She vanished, her pretty feet never stopped 

1191
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:35,750
 The king fumed 

1192
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:37,291
 This is how everyday 

1193
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:39,708
 The queen wears out 12 pairs of shoes 

1194
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:44,500
 That's how the tale goes 

1195
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,166
 Yet again she vanished 

1196
01:13:50,541 --> 01:13:53,583
 There is no stopping her feet 

1197
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:57,083
 They will walk, they will dance 

1198
01:13:57,166 --> 01:14:00,041
 Here and there merrily 

1199
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,916
 Enraged the king said queen 

1200
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,666
 Why do you insult me? 

1201
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,750
 My pride's gone up in smoke 

1202
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,708
 I'm the laughing stock of every joke 

1203
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:02,000
From today, I forbid you from stepping out! 

1204
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:06,000
Smiling at his words, the queen said king 

1205
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:11,000
 These walls of gold 

1206
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:15,375
 Give me no joy 

1207
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:21,708
 Give me freedom 

1208
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:25,166
 Lord 

1209
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,291
 Take the wealth and set me free 

1210
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,083
 Then in gusto 

1211
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:45,625
 Everyday in abandon 

1212
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,375
 What she had never done 

1213
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,000
 She did with the lowlife 

1214
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,666
 A flower child 

1215
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,208
 Bright and wild 

1216
01:15:52,291 --> 01:15:53,541
 Roamed, skipped, danced 

1217
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,708
 Those pretty fair feet 

1218
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:59,041
 Those feet 

1219
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:14,041
 Yet again she vanished 

1220
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:17,916
 There is no stopping her feet 

1221
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,291
 They will walk, they will dance 

1222
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,125
 Here There 

1223
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,666
 Here, there, God knows where 

1224
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,458
I think we should kiss now. - Really? - Yes. 

1225
01:17:05,708 --> 01:17:06,958
 Why do you think so? 

1226
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:08,750
 It's always the next step. 

1227
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,166
It happens in every movie. - Logic! - Then? 

1228
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:15,625
It's good that we are talking about it. 

1229
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,833
 These matters should be discussed... 

1230
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,000
you can't just get swayed by emotions and... 

1231
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,333
 you've kissed! 

1232
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:25,916
 A little precaution goes a long way. 

1233
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:28,250
 So let's discuss this in detail... 

1234
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,666
 and arrive at a suitable conclusion. 

1235
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,791
See It's important to weigh each option thoroughly... 

1236
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,291
 There are a 1000 issues! 

1237
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:38,000
My marriage and all... - We should plan this right... 

1238
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,375
 how do we kiss? 

1239
01:17:39,458 --> 01:17:40,958
 And which type of kiss? 

1240
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,666
 And what if we can't stop at a kiss? 

1241
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:43,875
 Correct! 

1242
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:45,791
If we keep going at it, at which point do we stop? 

1243
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,041
And in that frenzy, how will we know we've arrived.. 

1244
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,333
 ..at that point... to stop? 

1245
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:54,833
 We are items, both of us! 

1246
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:57,458
 Imagine if someone heard us... 

1247
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:28,291
 Okay... we should stop. 

1248
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:31,875
 Jordan! 

1249
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:35,791
 What the hell? 

1250
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,708
What do you think you're doing?! Get away! 

1251
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,583
 But why? - Why? 

1252
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:40,750
 You don't know why? 

1253
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,125
 Because this is wrong! 

1254
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,791
 Then why doesn't it feel wrong? 

1255
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,458
 Jordan... 

1256
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:49,708
 What do you think, huh? 

1257
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:52,625
What even gave you the idea you could try this with me? 

1258
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:43,833
 That was a lot of fun though. 

1259
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,625
 It's not a joke. 

1260
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,291
 Okay? 

1261
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:52,958
 It's serious. 

1262
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,791
 I've kissed before. 

1263
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:58,875
 Even had sex. 

1264
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,166
 But what was this? 

1265
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:11,458
 Listen... 

1266
01:20:11,541 --> 01:20:12,625
 from this point on... 

1267
01:20:13,166 --> 01:20:15,000
 we could ruin everything... 

1268
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,333
 but we shouldn't, right? 

1269
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,666
 So we won't. 

1270
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,750
 Now you drop me home and... 

1271
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:26,166
 we won't meet again after this. 

1272
01:20:28,208 --> 01:20:29,291
 It's too late, Heer. 

1273
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,916
 It's going to be difficult. 

1274
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:35,750
 But that's what will happen. 

1275
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,208
 Okay? 

1276
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,041
 Come on... start the motorbike. 

1277
01:20:43,375 --> 01:20:44,500
 Come on! 

1278
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:45,875
 Start the bike. 

1279
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:49,208
 Let's go... come. 

1280
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,250
 Hi... 

1281
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,708
 So you are the friend! 

1282
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,291
 I'm the sister-in-law. 

1283
01:21:30,541 --> 01:21:31,625
 Meena. 

1284
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:32,833
 So dinner tomorrow, right? 

1285
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:35,750
 You haven't told him? 

1286
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:37,500
 He is really busy. 

1287
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:40,000
 But I'm sure he has dinner. 

1288
01:21:40,458 --> 01:21:41,583
 Or you don't eat? 

1289
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:44,000
 No, no, you have to make it tomorrow. 

1290
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:46,208
 We're all very excited to meet you. 

1291
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,416
 Meena! - Alright. 

1292
01:21:48,791 --> 01:21:49,916
 Wonderful. 

1293
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:53,958
And we will take good care of you, don't worry. 

1294
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,083
 Bye. 

1295
01:21:58,541 --> 01:21:59,625
 Bye. 

1296
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,458
 Bye. - Bye. 

1297
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,375
 I hope you're not in a hurry, are you? 

1298
01:22:35,541 --> 01:22:37,000
 No, its nothing like that. 

1299
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,541
 There she is. 

1300
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,291
 Hi... Welcome. 

1301
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,208
 Jay... 

1302
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,375
 Hi... 

1303
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:45,791
 I've heard a lot about you. 

1304
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:47,416
 Like what? 

1305
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,958
 Good things... from Heer. 

1306
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:58,416
 You know something, Jordan. 

1307
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,125
Some of my friends are in the organizing committee of your program. 

1308
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:04,083
And they asked me to volunteer as well... 

1309
01:23:04,333 --> 01:23:05,750
 And I really wanted to... 

1310
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:06,958
 It would have been a lot of fun... 

1311
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:08,958
 But I was busy the whole month... 

1312
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,375
 So I had to give it up. 

1313
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,208
 And Jordan, let me tell you... 

1314
01:23:13,291 --> 01:23:16,583
ever since you've come to Prague and Heer has been meeting you... 

1315
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:18,958
her health has improved considerably. - Thanks. 

1316
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,958
In fact, Dr. Cermac was very happy and surprised. 

1317
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,958
You really seem to have the magic touch... 

1318
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,541
You know Heer... you should join this program. 

1319
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,208
 Brilliant! - Oh no! 

1320
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,666
 Why not? You should. 

1321
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:32,708
Think about it, you will really enjoy it. 

1322
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,583
 I want to hug you. 

1323
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,208
 Shut up! 

1324
01:23:43,291 --> 01:23:44,416
 Heer, I want to hug you. 

1325
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:46,375
 I'll wait behind the house. 

1326
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:47,583
 Have you lost your mind? 

1327
01:23:47,916 --> 01:23:49,375
 Just shut up and leave. 

1328
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,625
 I'll wait even if you don't come... 

1329
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:29,083
 What do you want? 

1330
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:01,541
 Stop, stop... 

1331
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:04,541
 Magic touch! 

1332
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,875
 But how? - I don't know... 

1333
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:15,916
 I don't know how... 

1334
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:32,166
 It's a statement of my helplessness 

1335
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,416
 Can't control this moment 

1336
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,208
 It's a statement of my helplessness 

1337
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:46,791
 Can't control this moment 

1338
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:52,875
 Squeeze out all desire 

1339
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:59,250
 Break you in my arms 

1340
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:03,041
 What I want, I don't know 

1341
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:07,083
 Snatch you, let you go 

1342
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:14,958
 What do I do at this moment 

1343
01:26:15,416 --> 01:26:23,583
 What do I do at this moment 

1344
01:26:24,666 --> 01:26:27,541
 What do I do to become calm, 

1345
01:26:27,625 --> 01:26:31,541
 At peace 

1346
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,125
 Let there be more 

1347
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:34,666
 This noise of breathing 

1348
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,083
 Passion burn brighter 

1349
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:39,250
 Let there be more 

1350
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:40,875
 This noise of breathing 

1351
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:43,125
 Fever rise higher 

1352
01:26:43,791 --> 01:26:45,166
 Let there be more 

1353
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,875
 Let us meet more 

1354
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:50,875
 And burn more 

1355
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:56,041
 I meet you for the first time 

1356
01:26:56,291 --> 01:26:57,666
 Each time 

1357
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,750
 It's a statement of my helplessness 

1358
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:14,666
 Should I snatch you or let you go 

1359
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:17,666
 Should I ask for you or turn you away 

1360
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:23,750
 What do I do at this moment 

1361
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:27,208
 What do I do to become calm, 

1362
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:30,666
 At peace 

1363
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,208
 Let there be more 

1364
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:33,750
 This noise of breathing 

1365
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:36,125
 Passion burn brighter 

1366
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,416
 Let there be more 

1367
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,000
 This noise of breathing 

1368
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:42,333
 Fever rise higher 

1369
01:27:43,083 --> 01:27:44,708
 Let there be more 

1370
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:46,250
 Let us meet more 

1371
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:50,041
 And burn more 

1372
01:28:20,791 --> 01:28:25,791
 I'm knotted up in desire 

1373
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:29,375
 Untie me 

1374
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,166
 I'm a knock 

1375
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:38,125
 You're the closed door 

1376
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:43,166
 Open up. 

1377
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:48,125
 Restlessness deep in my mind 

1378
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:51,541
 Come let us live this dream 

1379
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:53,250
 Let there be more 

1380
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,958
 This noise of breathing 

1381
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:57,166
 Passion burn brighter 

1382
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,666
 Let there be more 

1383
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:01,125
 Let us meet more 

1384
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:04,875
 And burn more 

1385
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:09,416
 It just doesn't stop 

1386
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:12,458
 Does not tire 

1387
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,750
 This storm 

1388
01:29:16,125 --> 01:29:18,708
 Of breath 

1389
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:22,041
 Don't even come to know 

1390
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:25,041
 What burns where 

1391
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:27,125
 With fear 

1392
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:30,500
 With body and mind 

1393
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,708
 All trembling 

1394
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:39,708
 With the scorch of desire 

1395
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:44,625
 Blazes more 

1396
01:29:44,708 --> 01:29:47,541
 Fire burns and smoke rises 

1397
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:50,583
 There is smoke everywhere 

1398
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:55,208
 It's a statement of my helplessness 

1399
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:01,416
 It's a statement of my helplessness 

1400
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,666
 It's a statement of my helplessness 

1401
01:30:42,958 --> 01:30:45,916
 Ustad Jameel Khan was right. 

1402
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,458
 You are a star. 

1403
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:51,666
Son, I'll pay you three times more than your contract! 

1404
01:30:52,041 --> 01:30:54,625
Look at that, a miser like me is willing to give more! 

1405
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:57,041
 He is a craze in India too. 

1406
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:58,666
Every day there's something new about him. 

1407
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,875
 He's busy. I'll say bye on the phone. 

1408
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:03,000
You've kept my reputation among these people. 

1409
01:31:03,666 --> 01:31:06,666
Now do the same in Barcelona and Paris. 

1410
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:12,458
 Artiste... creative... 

1411
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:15,208
Always in their own world... that's why he is an artiste. 

1412
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:22,875
 Just a minute... excuse me. 

1413
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:24,916
 Okay, no worry. 

1414
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:31,250
 I'll just be back. - Yes. 

1415
01:31:42,708 --> 01:31:43,875
 Bye... 

1416
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,250
 Bye Jordan. Say bye and let me go. 

1417
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:51,166
 They are waiting for me. 

1418
01:31:52,125 --> 01:31:53,250
 It will be a problem. 

1419
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:55,500
 Let it be a problem. 

1420
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,041
 It won't be for you. 

1421
01:31:57,375 --> 01:31:58,500
 You're going away. 

1422
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,375
After that don't you want me to be happy in my home? 

1423
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:03,125
 No. 

1424
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,708
I don't want you to be happy in your home. 

1425
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:08,583
 Don't you have any feelings at all? 

1426
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:12,500
 Really, what do you feel about me? 

1427
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:15,041
I feel that you should be here with me. 

1428
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:16,583
 Right now. 

1429
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:17,875
 That's all I feel. 

1430
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:20,125
 Then get lost! 

1431
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:21,958
 You only care about yourself. 

1432
01:32:22,583 --> 01:32:24,333
 It's always about what you want. 

1433
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,625
 Come here. 

1434
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,000
 You are uncouth and rude! 

1435
01:32:29,708 --> 01:32:31,500
 We wouldn't have lasted six months! 

1436
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,041
 Thank God you're going away. 

1437
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:35,958
 Are you deliberately fighting with me? 

1438
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:38,375
 I can't stand you any longer. 

1439
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:41,000
 You are deliberately fighting with me! 

1440
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:42,208
 Then what did you think? 

1441
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:43,875
 That we would part on a happy note? 

1442
01:32:44,250 --> 01:32:46,208
So that when we meet again, you could have fun with me again? 

1443
01:32:48,708 --> 01:32:50,791
 Are you mad? - I was then! 

1444
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:52,375
 But not anymore! 

1445
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:56,125
Come here... I want to say bye properly. 

1446
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:57,500
 Get lost! 

1447
01:32:57,583 --> 01:32:58,708
 Heer, you come here right now! 

1448
01:32:58,791 --> 01:32:59,875
 Go to hell! 

1449
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:01,875
 Heer, I'm telling you... - Go to hell! 

1450
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:04,958
 Never again! 

1451
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:41,833
 Go to hell! 

1452
01:33:44,083 --> 01:33:46,166
 All of you... stay away from me! 

1453
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,791
 What.. 

1454
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:06,541
 What happened? 

1455
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:09,416
I'll get your boarding pass, come quick. 

1456
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:12,666
But make it quick, tiger! Else I'll have a nervous breakdown. 

1457
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:47,208
 Hey. Stop. 

1458
01:34:54,458 --> 01:34:55,625
 Jordan? 

1459
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,083
 What the hell? What are you doing? 

1460
01:35:06,958 --> 01:35:08,500
 What have you done? 

1461
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:10,666
 Have you gone mad? - Heer... 

1462
01:35:10,916 --> 01:35:12,083
 Stay there... don't move! 

1463
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:13,833
 Jay... he won't do anything. 

1464
01:35:13,916 --> 01:35:15,000
 Don't shoot! 

1465
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:17,208
Move. - Don't shoot, don't shoot. Don't do anything. 

1466
01:35:17,291 --> 01:35:19,791
 Don't touch him! It's okay! It's fine! 

1467
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,083
 Heer? What's going on? 

1468
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:32,250
 There! Your plan's worked. 

1469
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:34,750
 Now I can never be happy in my home. 

1470
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:36,958
 I only wanted to say goodbye. 

1471
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:39,291
Don't show me your face as long as I live! 

1472
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:41,541
 I don't want to see you again! 

1473
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:44,833
 Really? 

1474
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:46,000
 Get out! 

1475
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:48,250
 Get out! 

1476
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:51,916
 Get out! 

1477
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:31,791
 No. 

1478
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:22,708
 Jordan. 

1479
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:26,041
 Jordan. Tell us 

1480
01:37:26,125 --> 01:37:28,166
Today the media isn't here to cover an artiste. 

1481
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,000
 It's here to cover a criminal. 

1482
01:37:30,458 --> 01:37:33,666
There are cases of assault and intrusion against Jordan in Prague. 

1483
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,666
 Platinum Music has also sued him. 

1484
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:41,083
 Jordan., 

1485
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,708
 Jordan, just one question. 

1486
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:48,875
 Jordan. 

1487
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:13,791
 In this world 

1488
01:38:15,041 --> 01:38:17,500
 Of yours 

1489
01:38:19,291 --> 01:38:21,583
 At every step 

1490
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,833
 Man is wrong 

1491
01:38:25,416 --> 01:38:31,583
 Whatever I think is right and do 

1492
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:35,875
 You say that it's wrong 

1493
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:40,500
 If I am wrong, then who is right? 

1494
01:38:40,583 --> 01:38:43,083
All I have to say about this is 'No comments'. 

1495
01:38:43,166 --> 01:38:44,708
How can you call the press and say 'no comments'? 

1496
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:48,041
Sir, isn't it a fact that you are releasing Jordan's next album? 

1497
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:50,291
An album of the songs he recorded for you in Europe? 

1498
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:51,625
 No comments. 

1499
01:38:51,708 --> 01:38:52,875
 Sir, sir.. 

1500
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:55,791
The album hits the stores and the artiste is in prison. 

1501
01:38:56,208 --> 01:38:57,625
 That is my vision. 

1502
01:38:57,708 --> 01:39:01,166
The little boy who grew up in this courtyard is now behind bars. 

1503
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:03,333
 Negative, negative... 

1504
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:05,166
 The media loves everything negative. 

1505
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:09,875
This is the very house that Jordan was kicked out of two years ago. 

1506
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:14,958
 To live by my wishes 

1507
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:23,083
 should I submit a petition to you? 

1508
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:29,208
 That means you have more right on me 

1509
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:34,708
 Than I do on myself 

1510
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,458
 My right 

1511
01:39:37,208 --> 01:39:39,291
 Keep it here 

1512
01:39:49,583 --> 01:39:50,875
 My right

01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:52,083
 Keep it here 

1514
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:53,333
 My right 

1515
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:54,500
 Keep it here 

1516
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:55,750
 My right 

1517
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:56,916
 Keep it here 

1518
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,166
 My right 

1519
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:59,458
 Keep it here 

1520
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:00,666
 My right 

1521
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:02,000
 Keep it here 

1522
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:03,166
 My right 

1523
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:04,333
 Keep it here 

1524
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,625
 My right 

1525
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:06,916
 Keep it here 

1526
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,125
 My right 

1527
01:40:08,208 --> 01:40:09,333
 Keep it here 

1528
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:20,500

 Keep it here 

1532
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,500
 My right 

1533
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:26,750
 Keep it here 

1534
01:40:26,833 --> 01:40:27,958
 My right 

1535
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:29,083
 Keep it here 

1536
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:34,333
 Hey 

1537
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:36,916
 In these queues 

1538
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,416
 And these debts 

1539
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,375
Why do you strangle my habit of living? 

1540
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:46,666
 I am uncouth 

1541
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:49,250
 I'm from those parts 

1542
01:40:49,333 --> 01:40:53,708
 Where there is no modesty, no shame 

1543
01:40:53,791 --> 01:40:57,458
Heart says that rituals are the fine of living 

1544
01:40:57,541 --> 01:40:58,750
 World is enemy 

1545
01:40:58,833 --> 01:41:00,083
 Everything is anti 

1546
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:01,541
 Set them on fire 

1547
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,416
 My heart tells me 

1548
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,458
 Live by your heart or die 

1549
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:51,958
 My right 

1550
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:53,125
 Keep it here 

1551
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:54,416
 My right 

1552
01:41:54,666 --> 01:41:55,666
 Keep it here 

1553
01:41:55,875 --> 01:41:56,916
 My right 

1554
01:41:57,041 --> 01:41:58,291
 Keep it here 

1555
01:41:58,375 --> 01:41:59,375
 My right 

1556
01:41:59,666 --> 01:42:00,666
 Keep it here 

1557
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:01,916
 My right 

1558
01:42:02,125 --> 01:42:03,208
 Keep it here 

1559
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:04,333
 My right 

1560
01:42:04,583 --> 01:42:05,708
 Keep it here 

1561
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:06,833
 My right 

1562
01:42:07,041 --> 01:42:08,166
 Keep it here 

1563
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,333
 My right 

1564
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:10,708
 Keep it here 

1565
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,083
 You know... 

1566
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:17,041
Many years ago there was a jungle over here. 

1567
01:42:17,541 --> 01:42:19,000
 A dense and fearsome jungle. 

1568
01:42:21,458 --> 01:42:23,250
Then one day, a city came up in its place. 

1569
01:42:24,416 --> 01:42:27,750
 Neat and tidy houses, wide roads. 

1570
01:42:28,333 --> 01:42:30,666
 Everything became planned and proper. 

1571
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,625
But the day the jungle was torn down... 

1572
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,875
 a flock of birds... 

1573
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,916
 flew away forever. 

1574
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:47,583
 It never came back. 

1575
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:53,375
 I'm looking for those birds. 

1576
01:42:57,375 --> 01:42:58,750
 Has anyone seen them? 

1577
01:42:58,833 --> 01:43:00,500
 No! 

1578
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:02,000
 Anyone seen them? 

1579
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:03,958
 No! 

1580
01:43:17,166 --> 01:43:18,875
 Eco-friendly 

1581
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:21,416
 Protector of nature 

1582
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:23,916
 I too am nature 

1583
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,583
 With tradition, with society 

1584
01:43:31,666 --> 01:43:33,458
 Why 

1585
01:43:37,041 --> 01:43:39,375
 You cut me up into pieces? 

1586
01:43:39,458 --> 01:43:43,375
 Why do you scatter me like this? 

1587
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:48,041
 Why teach lessons of truth 

1588
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:50,291
 When you can't handle the truth 

1589
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,791
 When someone speaks the truth 

1590
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,166
You inflict rules and regulations on him 

1591
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,875
 Your fear 

1592
01:43:57,666 --> 01:43:59,583
 Your love 

1593
01:43:59,791 --> 01:44:01,583
 Your praise 

1594
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:05,041
 Keep to yourself 

1595
01:44:05,708 --> 01:44:06,875

 My right 

1628
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,041
It seems like Jordan can't handle his new found success. 

1629
01:45:09,541 --> 01:45:11,875
This crowd here in Lucknow can't believe that.. 

1630
01:45:11,958 --> 01:45:13,208
 ..he didn't show up for his concert. 

1631
01:45:13,541 --> 01:45:15,166
 When its quite clear that... 

1632
01:45:15,458 --> 01:45:18,583
he was seen coming out of the Lucknow airport this morning. 

1633
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:20,125
 Has he lost it? 

1634
01:45:22,166 --> 01:45:24,000
 You want me to lock him up again? 

1635
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:31,958
 Dhingra sir... - Khatana... 

1636
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:34,041
 you better get him back to his senses. 

1637
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:39,083
Because I really feel like chopping him into tiny pieces. 

1638
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:47,541
 Don't sir me! 

1639
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,125
 I'm losing my money, bloody idiot! 

1640
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:55,041
I instructed all of you to watch his every move. 

1641
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,416
 Sir, he left of his own will. 

1642
01:46:32,958 --> 01:46:35,000
 All that I 

1643
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:36,541
 All that I 

1644
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,458
 Wish to say 

1645
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:42,500
 Is ruined by 

1646
01:46:43,583 --> 01:46:45,458
 My words 

1647
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:48,583
 My words 

1648
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,166
 "What did we take from the world?" 

1649
01:47:22,791 --> 01:47:25,875
 "What did the world give us?" 

1650
01:47:26,458 --> 01:47:30,125
 "Why should we care for the world?" 

1651
01:47:30,583 --> 01:47:33,666
 "Did the world care for us?" 

1652
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:54,250
 Even this day has come! 

1653
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:56,291
When I have to drag you out of a brothel. 

1654
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:59,500
You will be finished even before you start! 

1655
01:47:59,583 --> 01:48:00,708
 Mark my words. 

1656
01:48:01,166 --> 01:48:04,083
Your reputation is going from bad to worse. 

1657
01:48:04,166 --> 01:48:07,458
And you won't even realise when people start hating you. 

1658
01:48:10,125 --> 01:48:11,916
 What's happened to you, JJ? 

1659
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,333
 What are you becoming? 

1660
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:17,125
 What's your problem? 

1661
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:19,791
 Look at yourself! 

1662
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,541
Do you want people to run away from you? 

1663
01:48:22,625 --> 01:48:25,208
 Oh my, God. It's Jordan. 

1664
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:28,208
 Jordan. 

1665
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:30,125
 Jordan. 

1666
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:31,375
 You're listening to me, right? 

1667
01:48:31,708 --> 01:48:34,250
Jordan. - What I'm saying is very important. 

1668
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:36,541
One picture. - No, you can't! Get lost! 

1669
01:48:37,166 --> 01:48:38,250
 You can't talk like that! 

1670
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,166
 Jordan. - Who do you think you are? 

1671
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,083
 Anyone who meets you... 

1672
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:46,541
 gets put off by you! 

1673
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:50,250
 Your popularity is going down... 

1674
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:51,916
 do you know that? 

1675
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:54,791
Jordan. - All I want to know is that... 

1676
01:48:57,416 --> 01:48:59,250
 you should... 

1677
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:00,625
 Yes, Khatana bhai? 

1678
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,000
 Khatana bhai. - Jordan. 

1679
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:06,708
I understand what you're trying to tell me. 

1680
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:10,250
 I don't know why I act like this. 

1681
01:49:10,916 --> 01:49:12,000
 I can't seem to control myself. 

1682
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:13,333
 Jordan. Look here. 

1683
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:16,416
I don't like it. I don't even like myself. 

1684
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,833
 Jordan. 

1685
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,666
 Shouldn't I be happy right now? 

1686
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,125
 This is what I wanted. 

1687
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:26,666
 But happiness is nowhere in sight. 

1688
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:27,875
 It doesn't exist. 

1689
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:31,291
 It's like... - Jordan. 

1690
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:33,250
 only... 

1691
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,375
 as if bugs are biting me from inside. 

1692
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:38,000
 All the time. 

1693
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:39,958
 And all the time I'm... like this... 

1694
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:43,416
 I... 

1695
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:46,375
 Jordan - even I... 

1696
01:49:58,958 --> 01:50:01,166
 Jordan. - Stop calling out my name! 

1697
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:03,916
 How long does it take? 

1698
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:24,083
 Jordan. 

1699
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:26,166
 Jordan. 

1700
01:50:45,625 --> 01:50:47,458
 Now do you believe me? This is JJ... 

1701
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:49,000
 Come, come, let's take a picture. 

1702
01:50:49,083 --> 01:50:52,583
Photo... - Of course, we need some proof! 

1703
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,083
 Sweety, come on. 

1704
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:11,375
 Now it's my turn... 

1705
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:12,583
 Talk to me, at least. 

1706
01:51:15,833 --> 01:51:17,041
 Smile please. 

1707
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:33,125
 Anybody else wants a photo? 

1708
01:51:35,958 --> 01:51:37,208
 No more pictures? 

1709
01:51:39,791 --> 01:51:40,875
 You guys done? 

1710
01:51:42,875 --> 01:51:44,000
 Should I leave? 

1711
01:52:16,958 --> 01:52:18,083
 Sir... 

1712
01:52:18,666 --> 01:52:20,000
 a five-album contract? 

1713
01:52:20,083 --> 01:52:22,166
 And he can't perform anywhere else. 

1714
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:23,583
 Sir, isn't that too much? 

1715
01:52:23,666 --> 01:52:24,916
 Fine, don't sign. It's okay. 

1716
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,583
 Sir, sir... 

1717
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,125
 I've decided... 

1718
01:52:28,458 --> 01:52:29,583
 you can stay at home. 

1719
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:31,125
 Sir, just take a look... 

1720
01:52:31,208 --> 01:52:33,541
Sir, I agree with everything you say except... 

1721
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:00,375
Om "May auspices chase away the darkness" swaha 

1722
01:53:00,458 --> 01:53:03,000
 "My life is in your hands" swaha 

1723
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:07,166
 Om "Agreement can go to hell" swaha 

1724
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:09,250
 JJ. have you lost it? 

1725
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:10,875
 "Dhingra, you've been thrammed" swaha 

1726
01:53:11,416 --> 01:53:13,958
Such an insult of Mr. Dhingra! That too of Mr. Dhingra! 

1727
01:53:14,041 --> 01:53:17,958
"Everything is image, image is everything" swaha 

1728
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,125
 "You've been humiliated" swaha 

1729
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:22,458
 "Do what the hell you can" swaha 

1730
01:53:33,583 --> 01:53:35,583
 So, you're finished with Dhingra... 

1731
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:38,250
 what's next? 

1732
01:53:38,916 --> 01:53:41,750
Nimbus Records, London. They want to sign you. 

1733
01:53:41,958 --> 01:53:43,875
 And they will take over the lawsuits. 

1734
01:53:44,166 --> 01:53:45,291
 Why are they asking you? 

1735
01:53:45,375 --> 01:53:46,583
 They are afraid of you. 

1736
01:53:46,875 --> 01:53:48,375
 It's this image you have. 

1737
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:50,875
 They thought I'm close to you and... 

1738
01:53:51,375 --> 01:53:52,500
 Are you? 

1739
01:53:53,458 --> 01:53:54,541
 What? 

1740
01:53:56,208 --> 01:53:57,333
 Close? 

1741
01:54:35,791 --> 01:54:37,000
 You can't forget her, can you? 

1742
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:44,000
 Jordan, the Casanova. 

1743
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:46,666
 The bad boy of music. 

1744
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,750
 Secretly burning in someone's love. 

1745
01:54:52,583 --> 01:54:53,708
 How cute! 

1746
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:05,333
 It will never happen, Jordan. 

1747
01:55:07,833 --> 01:55:08,958
 I am not Heer. 

1748
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,125
 It's a story. 

1749
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:21,583
 Front page. 

1750
01:56:54,625 --> 01:56:55,958
 We need to talk. 

1751
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:58,625
 Not in this condition, Heer. 

1752
01:57:00,750 --> 01:57:02,833
 I have Bone Marrow Aplasia, Jay. 

1753
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:06,083
 I'm not getting better. 

1754
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:10,041
 My condition will only worsen. 

1755
01:57:13,083 --> 01:57:15,291
 So, what do you want to do? 

1756
01:57:16,666 --> 01:57:17,833
 You tell me. 

1757
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:22,125
 I've been unfaithful to you, Jay. 

1758
01:57:23,666 --> 01:57:25,250
 I've crossed the line. 

1759
01:57:27,416 --> 01:57:30,083
I knew all along I was doing something wrong. 

1760
01:57:31,333 --> 01:57:33,166
 I knew it every second. 

1761
01:57:34,375 --> 01:57:38,666
I was trying hard to stop myself but... 

1762
01:57:40,333 --> 01:57:41,541
 I don't know why... 

1763
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,166
 I don't know what came over me. 

1764
01:57:46,833 --> 01:57:49,250
 So what do you feel about him now? 

1765
01:57:54,666 --> 01:57:56,250
 This feeling will go away. 

1766
01:57:58,250 --> 01:58:00,000
 With time this will all go away. 

1767
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,416
 We'll talk after some time then. 

1768
01:59:06,833 --> 01:59:08,041
 Jordan! 

1769
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,625
 Jordan! 

1770
01:59:10,375 --> 01:59:11,500
 Mandy... 

1771
01:59:11,833 --> 01:59:13,166
 Mandy... Heer's sister? 

1772
01:59:15,291 --> 01:59:16,458
 I need to talk to you. 

1773
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,000
 Where can I meet you? 

1774
01:59:53,458 --> 01:59:54,583
 Hey... 

1775
01:59:54,958 --> 01:59:56,083
 'Wild Youth'! 

1776
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,291
 Hello... 

1777
02:00:05,958 --> 02:00:07,291
 Come on wake up, I'm bored. 

1778
02:00:09,083 --> 02:00:10,208
 You've slept enough. 

1779
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:24,166
 This shouldn't have happened... 

1780
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:26,458
 Sorry? 

1781
02:00:27,833 --> 02:00:28,958
 What? 

1782
02:00:41,791 --> 02:00:43,083
 Can you step outside for a second? 

1783
02:00:52,833 --> 02:00:53,958
 Shut the door. 

1784
02:00:59,958 --> 02:01:01,291
 After what happened in Prague... 

1785
02:01:03,375 --> 02:01:06,833
 how dare you come in to my house? 

1786
02:01:08,458 --> 02:01:09,583
 Aren't you ashamed at all? 

1787
02:01:10,041 --> 02:01:11,750
 You will hear from dad. 

1788
02:01:15,833 --> 02:01:17,083
 You'll never come back here again. 

1789
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:20,750
 Go. 

1790
02:01:22,083 --> 02:01:23,250
 I can't do that. 

1791
02:01:26,083 --> 02:01:27,291
 I know myself. 

1792
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:28,625
 I will definitely stay with Heer. 

1793
02:01:30,375 --> 02:01:31,500
 Listen... 

1794
02:01:32,208 --> 02:01:35,875
Heer is not in any condition to face any more drama, understand? 

1795
02:01:36,541 --> 02:01:39,375
She can't take even a little tension. She will collapse. 

1796
02:01:39,458 --> 02:01:40,583
 Precisely! 

1797
02:01:42,083 --> 02:01:43,166
 You know... 

1798
02:01:44,166 --> 02:01:45,541
 nothing will happen to Heer. 

1799
02:01:45,625 --> 02:01:46,791
 Don't worry. 

1800
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:49,958
 You don't believe me, right? 

1801
02:01:50,875 --> 02:01:52,166
 You think I'm not making any sense? 

1802
02:01:53,708 --> 02:01:54,833
 But you will see. 

1803
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:05,875
 Mom... 

1804
02:02:05,958 --> 02:02:07,666
 she is dying anyway... 

1805
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:08,875
 Shut up! 

1806
02:02:09,666 --> 02:02:11,875
Your family wants to throw me out but don't you worry... 

1807
02:02:11,958 --> 02:02:13,083
 I will come back. 

1808
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,833
 And before they can come in... 

1809
02:02:16,416 --> 02:02:17,541
 let's have a quick kiss. 

1810
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,125
 Jordan! 

1811
02:02:22,208 --> 02:02:24,250
Quick... they'll come in... - Stop it... stay right there. 

1812
02:02:24,333 --> 02:02:25,458
 But we don't have time. 

1813
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:26,708
 Shut up! Move away! 

1814
02:02:26,791 --> 02:02:29,041
Listen Heer, I will kiss you, no matter what you do. 

1815
02:02:29,291 --> 02:02:30,833
 Jordan, don't... I will kill you. 

1816
02:02:30,916 --> 02:02:32,083
 Okay, on your cheek... 

1817
02:02:32,166 --> 02:02:33,375
 Have you lost it? 

1818
02:02:33,458 --> 02:02:35,041
 Come on... by now we would've done it! 

1819
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:36,916
 Jordan, I swear... I will... 

1820
02:02:38,291 --> 02:02:39,416
 What happened? 

1821
02:02:41,166 --> 02:02:43,500
 How are you standing? 

1822
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:56,500
 She's just the same. 

1823
02:02:57,791 --> 02:02:59,000
 But she was on her feet! 

1824
02:02:59,833 --> 02:03:01,583
She didn't get out of bed for three weeks. 

1825
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:02,791
 That's a good thing, right? 

1826
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:04,041
 But how? 

1827
02:03:09,125 --> 02:03:10,458
 You want to talk to him? 

1828
02:03:11,958 --> 02:03:13,041
 What are you doing, Mandy? 

1829
02:03:13,458 --> 02:03:14,583
 So, that's a no? 

1830
02:03:16,666 --> 02:03:18,083
 Why doesn't he get it? 

1831
02:03:18,833 --> 02:03:19,916
 Hello... 

1832
02:03:20,166 --> 02:03:22,083
She doesn't want to talk to you. - Give me the phone. 

1833
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:27,125
 Listen... - When will you die? 

1834
02:03:32,291 --> 02:03:33,416
 Hello? 

1835
02:03:34,291 --> 02:03:35,916
 Hello Heer? - Yes, what? 

1836
02:03:36,166 --> 02:03:38,000
 The doctor said you are dying, right? 

1837
02:03:39,291 --> 02:03:40,375
 So when are you dying? 

1838
02:03:41,166 --> 02:03:42,416
 Even this is a joke? 

1839
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,041
 Not at all, it's serious. 

1840
02:03:46,583 --> 02:03:48,166
Your factory doesn't produce blood anymore... 

1841
02:03:48,791 --> 02:03:49,916
 What do you want? 

1842
02:03:50,583 --> 02:03:51,750
 I want to ask you... 

1843
02:03:52,666 --> 02:03:54,666
if there is a security alarm system in your house? 

1844
02:03:55,791 --> 02:03:57,458
 Why? What are you going to do? 

1845
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,041
 Just asking... 

1846
02:04:00,291 --> 02:04:02,000
The security system in Prague was very loud. 

1847
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:05,708
 Even the lights came on immediately. 

1848
02:04:07,708 --> 02:04:08,958
 The whole situation changed. 

1849
02:04:11,041 --> 02:04:13,041
I had no idea such security systems existed. 

1850
02:04:13,958 --> 02:04:15,291
 Some really hi-tech stuff. 

1851
02:04:21,916 --> 02:04:23,375
 You shouldn't have stepped out. 

1852
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:25,875
 Now... 

1853
02:04:27,375 --> 02:04:28,791
 I will have to come to you. 

1854
02:04:31,583 --> 02:04:32,666
 Jordan... 

1855
02:04:34,958 --> 02:04:36,125
 don't do this. 

1856
02:04:38,291 --> 02:04:40,250
 I won't be able to bear it. 

1857
02:04:41,666 --> 02:04:42,791
 I'm doing this? 

1858
02:04:46,333 --> 02:04:48,041
You said you didn't want to see me again... 

1859
02:04:48,958 --> 02:04:50,041
 did I try to meet you? 

1860
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:54,125
Did I even call you in the last two years? 

1861
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,750
 I tried not to even think about you. 

1862
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:03,166
 But what happened? 

1863
02:05:04,666 --> 02:05:05,791
 Here you are... 

1864
02:05:07,041 --> 02:05:08,291
 standing in front of me. 

1865
02:05:10,583 --> 02:05:11,708
 Don't you get it, Heer? 

1866
02:05:15,208 --> 02:05:16,416
 This is something else. 

1867
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:19,041
 That's bringing you and me together. 

1868
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,291
 We couldn't stay apart, right? 

1869
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:24,583
 We couldn't. 

1870
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:28,625
 I'm such a big celebrity, Heer. 

1871
02:05:29,333 --> 02:05:30,500
 I'm a star! 

1872
02:05:31,666 --> 02:05:34,208
 I'm rich and famous... 

1873
02:05:34,958 --> 02:05:36,916
 but I'm only burning inside... 

1874
02:05:37,208 --> 02:05:38,291
 there's a restlessness... 

1875
02:05:42,833 --> 02:05:46,375
I'm only good with you, it's that simple. 

1876
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:49,041
 And it's the same with you. 

1877
02:05:49,958 --> 02:05:51,000
 When I'm not around.. 

1878
02:05:51,083 --> 02:05:52,666
.. you get afflicted with a life threatening illness... 

1879
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:55,125
 your body stops producing blood. 

1880
02:05:58,916 --> 02:06:00,291
 I'm dying, Jordan! 

1881
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:03,708
 Perhaps a few months or... 

1882
02:06:04,958 --> 02:06:06,041
 a year. 

1883
02:06:07,416 --> 02:06:09,916
 After that I'll be dead. 

1884
02:06:10,916 --> 02:06:12,041
 And what if you don't die? 

1885
02:06:13,958 --> 02:06:15,041
 What if nothing happens to you? 

1886
02:06:17,083 --> 02:06:18,208
 Then will you be mine? 

1887
02:06:21,625 --> 02:06:22,791
 Jordan... 

1888
02:06:24,083 --> 02:06:25,875
 can you hug me? 

1889
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:31,500
 Hello? 

1890
02:06:42,625 --> 02:06:43,791
 What is it? 

1891
02:06:44,291 --> 02:06:45,458
 He's coming... 

1892
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,083
 He's coming... 

1893
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:29,875
 Heer? 

1894
02:07:35,083 --> 02:07:36,291
 Are you in a hurry? 

1895
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:41,125
 Hold me closer... tighter! 

1896
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:06,833
 You are like a guitar. 

1897
02:09:10,666 --> 02:09:11,916
And these are your high notes... here... 

1898
02:09:19,833 --> 02:09:21,708
 Her blood count has improved. 

1899
02:09:22,666 --> 02:09:23,875
 See... 

1900
02:09:28,416 --> 02:09:30,375
And you think this is because of Jordan? 

1901
02:09:33,958 --> 02:09:35,666
Do you know what kind of a person he is? 

1902
02:09:35,958 --> 02:09:37,041
 Virath... 

1903
02:09:37,666 --> 02:09:38,833
 two weeks ago... 

1904
02:09:38,916 --> 02:09:41,583
Heer didn't even have the strength to talk. 

1905
02:09:42,583 --> 02:09:45,083
Despite all our efforts she was sinking. 

1906
02:09:45,166 --> 02:09:46,750
Her condition was getting worse by the day. 

1907
02:09:47,916 --> 02:09:50,333
 Now she goes for a walk... 

1908
02:09:50,666 --> 02:09:52,416
 comes down for breakfast... 

1909
02:09:52,958 --> 02:09:54,125
 and this blood report! 

1910
02:09:56,333 --> 02:09:57,625
 Whatever it is and... 

1911
02:09:58,291 --> 02:09:59,625
 however it might be happening... 

1912
02:10:00,291 --> 02:10:02,625
 you think I'm going to intervene? 

1913
02:10:02,708 --> 02:10:03,833
 Or stop it? 

1914
02:10:04,375 --> 02:10:07,833
Listen Neena, she may look cheerful from the outside.. 

1915
02:10:07,916 --> 02:10:09,625
 ..but internally she is very weak. 

1916
02:10:09,958 --> 02:10:11,666
Even a little blood loss, could prove fatal. 

1917
02:10:11,750 --> 02:10:12,875
 You've already said this. 

1918
02:10:13,416 --> 02:10:15,041
We are taking all the necessary precautions, right? 

1919
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:16,666
 Neena please. 

1920
02:10:17,458 --> 02:10:18,625
 Be logical. 

1921
02:10:19,875 --> 02:10:22,541
There have been greater miracles in this world, Animesh. 

1922
02:10:24,291 --> 02:10:26,416
 We think we know life... 

1923
02:10:27,291 --> 02:10:29,708
but life always manages to surprise us. 

1924
02:10:34,416 --> 02:10:36,375
 Wow, Jordan! 

1925
02:10:42,833 --> 02:10:43,958
 Oh no! 

1926
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,541
That's what I wondered, such a big star... 

1927
02:10:51,208 --> 02:10:52,458
 doesn't he have to work? 

1928
02:10:53,208 --> 02:10:56,041
But every time I ask, he says "I'm free". 

1929
02:10:56,291 --> 02:10:58,333
 Twelve recordings, six shows and... 

1930
02:10:58,708 --> 02:11:00,333
 a product launch have been cancelled. 

1931
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:02,750
Khatana bhai... - We've been served two legal notices. 

1932
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:05,333
 I'm avoiding everyone. 

1933
02:11:06,375 --> 02:11:08,666
What do I say? Even I don't know where he is? 

1934
02:11:09,166 --> 02:11:10,333
 For the past month... 

1935
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:12,375
 his phone has been switched off. 

1936
02:11:12,625 --> 02:11:13,875
 And here he's using another phone! 

1937
02:11:14,708 --> 02:11:15,875
 Where is he... 

1938
02:11:16,375 --> 02:11:17,875
 is he alive or dead... 

1939
02:11:17,958 --> 02:11:19,625
 By God! So much drama! 

1940
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:20,833
 You think this is a joke? 

1941
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:23,500
 These international companies... 

1942
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:27,125
 they have an army of lawyers... 

1943
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:30,041
whose job is to make life miserable for people like us. 

1944
02:11:31,041 --> 02:11:32,125
 That's his style... 

1945
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:33,500
first he scares you and then saves you. 

1946
02:11:33,791 --> 02:11:35,333
 But this time you aren't safe. 

1947
02:11:35,416 --> 02:11:36,541
 Trust me... 

1948
02:11:36,625 --> 02:11:38,041
 this time you're going to prison. 

1949
02:11:38,791 --> 02:11:39,875
 See? 

1950
02:11:41,375 --> 02:11:42,583
 He just doesn't listen. 

1951
02:11:43,333 --> 02:11:45,500
I don't understand what to do with him. 

1952
02:11:45,875 --> 02:11:46,958
 We'll figure that later. 

1953
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:49,166
 What do you want him to do right now? 

1954
02:11:49,708 --> 02:11:50,833
 The concert at Kangra. 

1955
02:11:51,125 --> 02:11:53,041
 And there are more concerts all over. 

1956
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:54,708
 Kangra in Himachal Pradesh? 

1957
02:11:54,791 --> 02:11:55,875
 McLeodgunj! 

1958
02:11:56,875 --> 02:11:59,208
The tickets for the concert have been sold. 

1959
02:11:59,500 --> 02:12:00,750
 Khatana bhai, understand this clearly. 

1960
02:12:01,333 --> 02:12:02,875
I'm not going to Kangra or any other place. 

1961
02:12:03,125 --> 02:12:04,291
 See? 

1962
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:06,000
 But I'm going there. 

1963
02:12:06,583 --> 02:12:07,708
 I want to go. 

1964
02:12:08,458 --> 02:12:10,041
 I want to go to the hills. 

1965
02:12:10,708 --> 02:12:12,583
 I want to see the Himalayas again. 

1966
02:12:14,333 --> 02:12:15,500
 Bike ride... 

1967
02:12:15,916 --> 02:12:17,041
 sunrise... 

1968
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:19,291
burn a bonfire at night... getting wet in the rain... 

1969
02:12:19,375 --> 02:12:21,791
walking through a forest... dense forest. 

1970
02:12:21,875 --> 02:12:24,166
 And smoking a hookah! - Okay. 

1971
02:12:24,416 --> 02:12:26,875
And you know Jordan... that Rockstar... 

1972
02:12:27,083 --> 02:12:29,541
who takes chartered flights for his concerts. 

1973
02:12:29,625 --> 02:12:30,708
 Oh, that guy? 

1974
02:12:30,791 --> 02:12:32,916
 Yes, I want to see him perform live. 

1975
02:12:33,375 --> 02:12:35,500
 So little time and so much to do! 

1976
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:52,041
 Welcome to Himachal Pradesh. 

1977
02:12:52,125 --> 02:12:53,250
 How do you like it here? 

1978
02:12:53,333 --> 02:12:56,000
Jordan, we've seen her picture on You Tube. What is her name? 

1979
02:12:56,041 --> 02:12:57,375
 Please introduce her. 

1980
02:12:57,458 --> 02:12:59,791
 Hold on! - Please tell us.. 

1981
02:13:00,541 --> 02:13:02,458
 Don't report anything about her, okay? 

1982
02:13:02,708 --> 02:13:04,000
 Why not? Is she your girlfriend? 

1983
02:13:04,083 --> 02:13:06,625
How long have you been together? - When did you first meet her? 

1984
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,083
 Stop it! 

1985
02:13:13,166 --> 02:13:14,250
 Don't click any pictures. 

1986
02:13:14,333 --> 02:13:16,333
It's said that she is married, is this true? 

1987
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:17,833
 Really? Who is her husband? 

1988
02:13:17,916 --> 02:13:19,041
 Sir, please tell us something. 

1989
02:13:19,125 --> 02:13:20,708
I'll break the cameras if you click her pictures. 

1990
02:13:20,791 --> 02:13:22,916
This story will definitely come out. - No it won't! 

1991
02:13:24,875 --> 02:13:26,000
 Get lost! 

1992
02:13:34,375 --> 02:13:37,500
 Jordan! Come on now... - This is.. 

1993
02:13:50,166 --> 02:13:51,375
 They are all gone. 

1994
02:13:53,875 --> 02:13:55,750
It's said that she is married, is this true? 

1995
02:13:55,833 --> 02:13:56,958
 Really? Who is her husband? 

1996
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,500
 Is she your girlfriend? 

1997
02:13:59,583 --> 02:14:01,458
 It's my life. 

1998
02:14:02,041 --> 02:14:03,708
 It's my life. 

1999
02:14:06,916 --> 02:14:08,000
 Bye... 

2000
02:14:09,958 --> 02:14:11,333
 Say bye and let me go. 

2001
02:14:14,541 --> 02:14:15,833
 Won't you listen to me? 

2002
02:14:16,958 --> 02:14:18,000
 I am listening to you. 

2003
02:14:19,041 --> 02:14:20,083
 Am I not finishing the tour? 

2004
02:14:21,083 --> 02:14:22,250
 Thank you. 

2005
02:14:23,333 --> 02:14:24,583
 You aren't listening to me. 

2006
02:14:25,875 --> 02:14:27,208
 At this time I should leave. 

2007
02:14:27,583 --> 02:14:28,708
 Fine... go! 

2008
02:14:29,791 --> 02:14:31,458
 I won't get a bye? - Bye. 

2009
02:14:32,708 --> 02:14:33,833
 Smile? 

2010
02:14:40,666 --> 02:14:43,625
Finish the concerts and come back to me fast. 

2011
02:14:44,208 --> 02:14:45,333
 Okay? 

2012
02:16:13,625 --> 02:16:16,833
 All night I spin your yarn 

2013
02:16:16,916 --> 02:16:19,416
 All night I spin your yarn 

2014
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:22,208
 All night I spin your yarn 

2015
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:24,708
 All night I spin your yarn 

2016
02:16:24,791 --> 02:16:27,625
 All night I spin your yarn 

2017
02:16:27,708 --> 02:16:32,125
 All night I spin your yarn 

2018
02:16:52,625 --> 02:16:54,583
 Mandy, call Jordan. 

2019
02:16:54,666 --> 02:16:56,583
Tell him to come right now... right now! 

2020
02:16:56,666 --> 02:16:58,083
Drive towards the back gate... into the emergency. 

2021
02:17:08,375 --> 02:17:09,708
 She can't be pregnant, right? 

2022
02:17:12,708 --> 02:17:13,791
 What? 

2023
02:17:15,666 --> 02:17:16,791
 Neena, please! 

2024
02:17:19,541 --> 02:17:21,250
 Tell me that she's not pregnant. 

2025
02:17:31,041 --> 02:17:33,791
Mandy... - Heer isn't pregnant, is she? 

2026
02:17:36,916 --> 02:17:38,000
 Jordan! 

2027
02:17:40,375 --> 02:17:41,541
 Tell me! 

2028
02:17:41,625 --> 02:17:42,750
 Answer! 

2029
02:17:52,625 --> 02:17:54,666
Even I know a thing or two about business. 

2030
02:17:54,750 --> 02:17:55,875
 What happened? 

2031
02:17:56,333 --> 02:17:57,458
 JJ? 

2032
02:17:57,791 --> 02:17:58,916
 JJ, what happened? 

2033
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,041
 What's the matter? 

2034
02:18:00,458 --> 02:18:03,541
 Yes... okay... 

2035
02:18:04,833 --> 02:18:06,000
 It's important to go, right? 

2036
02:18:11,500 --> 02:18:13,166
 Heer is still undergoing transfusion. 

2037
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,833
 Sir, I leave everything up to you. 

2038
02:18:22,875 --> 02:18:24,875
 No, sir. Please try putting in a word. 

2039
02:18:24,958 --> 02:18:28,041
 Sir. I'll call you back. 

2040
02:18:35,458 --> 02:18:36,583
 Jordan ji... 

2041
02:18:42,083 --> 02:18:43,250
 Listen... 

2042
02:18:44,083 --> 02:18:46,625
 I can't come right now... 

2043
02:18:47,333 --> 02:18:48,416
 okay? 

2044
02:18:48,708 --> 02:18:49,833
 I... 

2045
02:18:50,416 --> 02:18:51,541
 the operation is on... 

2046
02:18:51,875 --> 02:18:53,000
 someone is inside... 

2047
02:18:53,416 --> 02:18:55,333
 Sir, we also have our orders. 

2048
02:18:55,416 --> 02:18:56,541
 No. 

2049
02:18:56,625 --> 02:18:57,750
 Not right now. 

2050
02:18:59,375 --> 02:19:00,458
 Now... 

2051
02:19:02,875 --> 02:19:04,333
 I don't want any of this. 

2052
02:19:05,083 --> 02:19:06,333
 I don't want to be big. 

2053
02:19:07,416 --> 02:19:09,541
My heart should not break, Khatana bhai... 

2054
02:19:10,166 --> 02:19:12,041
My heart should not break. - Yes, my dear... 

2055
02:19:12,375 --> 02:19:14,875
Please Khatana bhai, please do something... 

2056
02:19:15,875 --> 02:19:17,208
 I have nothing else... 

2057
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:19,916
 This shouldn't happen... 

2058
02:19:20,625 --> 02:19:21,708
 please! 

2059
02:19:22,291 --> 02:19:23,416
 Are you happy now? 

2060
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:25,916
 You are responsible for this. 

2061
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:28,916
Mandy... - You put her into a coma, you b******! 

2062
02:19:56,958 --> 02:19:58,083
 Hey... 

2063
02:19:59,250 --> 02:20:00,375
 'Wild Youth' 

2064
02:20:04,375 --> 02:20:05,541
 Come on... 

2065
02:20:06,791 --> 02:20:07,916
 wake up... let's go. 

2066
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:13,666
 Heer... 

2067
02:20:17,541 --> 02:20:18,666
 Heer... 

2068
02:21:01,291 --> 02:21:03,166
 You've killed her, Jordan... 

2069
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:04,416
 remember that. 

2070
02:21:04,875 --> 02:21:09,000
And I pray that you pay for it all your life! 

2071
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:11,500
 That you suffer every second. 

2072
02:21:11,583 --> 02:21:13,916
 Because you are her illness, Jordan. 

2073
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,541
 You've killed her! 

2074
02:21:21,333 --> 02:21:24,583
 Jordan. 

2075
02:21:28,125 --> 02:21:32,458
Do you love her? What are your feelings for her? 

2076
02:21:32,541 --> 02:21:36,083
 innocent bird 

2077
02:21:36,166 --> 02:21:38,958

 Come home 

2085
02:22:19,250 --> 02:22:22,875
 Why do you wander strange lands 

2086
02:22:22,958 --> 02:22:26,541
 Ravaged and tired 

2087
02:22:26,625 --> 02:22:30,041
 Why do you wander strange lands 

2088
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,875
 Like a vagabond day and night 

2089
02:22:33,958 --> 02:22:37,541
 innocent bird 

2090
02:22:37,625 --> 02:22:40,791

 Innocent bird Come home 

2096
02:22:55,333 --> 02:22:59,000
 A hundred bruises cover your body 

2097
02:22:59,083 --> 02:23:02,916
 Clothes of all deeds are dirty 

2098
02:23:46,791 --> 02:23:53,375
No matter how much you cut the air with your wings 

2099
02:23:53,458 --> 02:23:59,083
You'll never be able to escape yourself 

2100
02:24:01,208 --> 02:24:04,750
 Break the skies 

2101
02:24:04,833 --> 02:24:07,875
 Burn the world 

2102
02:24:07,958 --> 02:24:13,416
 You won't be able to hide yourself 

2103
02:24:13,750 --> 02:24:17,000
 Take any path 

2104
02:24:17,541 --> 02:24:20,708
 You reside in you 

2105
02:24:21,041 --> 02:24:27,875
 You'll come back to your own home 

2106
02:24:27,958 --> 02:24:33,333
 innocent 

2107
02:24:34,625 --> 02:24:38,625

 scavenging bird 

2117
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:36,583
 It's my small plea to you 

2118
02:25:36,666 --> 02:25:39,500
 Gorge on all of my flesh 

2119
02:25:40,083 --> 02:25:42,166
 scavenging bird 

2120
02:25:42,250 --> 02:25:43,750
 It's my small plea to you 

2121
02:25:43,833 --> 02:25:46,375
 Gorge on all of my flesh 

2122
02:25:46,458 --> 02:25:50,958
 Don't eat my eyes 

2123
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,125
 I hope to see my beloved 

2124
02:25:54,458 --> 02:25:58,166
 Don't eat my eyes 

2125
02:25:58,250 --> 02:26:01,208
 I hope to see my beloved

02:26:19,625 --> 02:26:22,958
 innocent 

2131
02:27:00,958 --> 02:27:07,083
 You I have finally got 

2132
02:27:08,875 --> 02:27:14,791
 In a way that 

2133
02:27:16,333 --> 02:27:22,541
 Like I am 

2134
02:27:23,708 --> 02:27:27,541
 Your feelings 

2135
02:27:29,083 --> 02:27:35,541
 Close to you I am 

2136
02:27:52,791 --> 02:27:54,041
 They are all gone. 

2137
02:27:55,458 --> 02:27:56,958
 This is our world... 

2138
02:27:58,333 --> 02:27:59,416
 only ours... 

2139
02:28:01,208 --> 02:28:02,541
 there's no one else here. 

2140
02:28:04,750 --> 02:28:06,125
 No journalists... 

2141
02:28:07,416 --> 02:28:08,708
 No photographer... 

2142
02:28:09,875 --> 02:28:11,125
 No society. 

2143
02:28:12,041 --> 02:28:13,166
 No rules... 

2144
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:16,416
 No Bone Marrow Aplasia... 

2145
02:28:17,666 --> 02:28:18,791
 No hospital... 

2146
02:28:20,041 --> 02:28:21,125
 No doctors... 

2147
02:28:23,375 --> 02:28:24,666
 No contract... 

2148
02:28:25,666 --> 02:28:27,041
 No court case... 

2149
02:28:29,291 --> 02:28:30,416
 Not your marriage... 

2150
02:28:33,791 --> 02:28:34,916
 No stopping... 

2151
02:28:36,375 --> 02:28:37,583
 No limits... 

2152
02:28:39,541 --> 02:28:40,666
 In this world... 

2153
02:28:42,375 --> 02:28:44,583
 we can let go of everything. 

2154
02:28:51,166 --> 02:28:53,125
 Do you like our world, Jordan? 

2155
02:28:55,166 --> 02:28:56,541
 I won't be able to live outside. 

2156
02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:59,041
 You don't need to live outside. 

2157
02:29:01,291 --> 02:29:02,583
 You have to stay here. 

2158
02:29:03,250 --> 02:29:04,333
 Now. 

2159
02:29:08,166 --> 02:29:09,250
 Forever. 

2160
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:37,833
 You are 

2161
02:29:44,166 --> 02:29:47,000
 In this world 

2162
02:29:49,083 --> 02:29:52,958
 Wherever 

2163
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,166
 Hold me to your embrace 

2164
02:30:00,041 --> 02:30:09,458
 I have given myself to you 

2165
02:30:14,875 --> 02:30:19,916
 No barriers remain 

2166
02:30:20,666 --> 02:30:25,458
 Left between us 

2167
02:30:25,708 --> 02:30:30,083
 For you 

2168
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,958
 You 

2169
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:38,125
 I have finally got 

2170
02:30:38,583 --> 02:30:40,791
 Finally got 

2171
02:30:41,208 --> 02:30:45,208
 In a way that 

2172
02:30:45,833 --> 02:30:48,291
 Like I am 

2173
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:51,666
 Your feelings 

2174
02:30:51,875 --> 02:30:56,500
 Close to you I am 

2175
02:31:18,625 --> 02:31:22,333
 From wherever 

2176
02:31:23,791 --> 02:31:27,875
 To wherever 

2177
02:31:28,166 --> 02:31:33,291
 Let's wander without reason 

2178
02:31:34,583 --> 02:31:38,041
 Without asking 

2179
02:31:38,791 --> 02:31:43,250
 Anyone, we meet 

2180
02:31:49,333 --> 02:31:54,291
 No barriers remain 

2181
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,833
 Left between us 

2182
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:03,958
 You Are 

2183
02:32:04,583 --> 02:32:07,083
 You Are 

2184
02:32:07,791 --> 02:32:12,500
 Near me, with me 

2185
02:32:12,583 --> 02:32:16,708
 In a way that 

2186
02:32:17,291 --> 02:32:22,416
 The more I feel you 

2187
02:32:22,833 --> 02:32:27,041
 The more I get you 

2188
02:32:47,958 --> 02:32:52,000
 In what way 

2189
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,833
 Will this world 

2190
02:32:57,625 --> 02:33:01,166
 Snatch you from me 

2191
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:03,375
 You too 

2192
02:33:03,875 --> 02:33:07,625
 Are me 

2193
02:33:08,125 --> 02:33:13,291
 What's there to fear now 

2194
02:33:33,916 --> 02:33:39,416
 You are meant for me 

2195
02:33:39,625 --> 02:33:42,250
 Meant for me 

2196
02:33:42,333 --> 02:33:45,291
 In a way that 

2197
02:33:46,791 --> 02:33:51,833
 I've lost myself to you 

2198
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,916
 And you I have won 

2199
02:34:12,208 --> 02:34:16,791
 You Are
