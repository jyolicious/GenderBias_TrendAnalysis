1
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:10,694
I'll check him tomorrow

2
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:19,874
Mister Sinha, this is a case
of liver cirrhosis

3
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:25,413
The liver is badly damaged.
The patient is under observation

4
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:27,623
It's difficult to say anything yet

5
00:04:28,694 --> 00:04:30,483
But, you can do something?

6
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:37,223
The problem is, we can't do a liver
transplant... on such short notice

7
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:45,933
If you wish to inform her
family or relatives...

8
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:48,273
...you may use my phone

9
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:13,403
Hey buddy, how are you?
Where are you?

10
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:17,403
I'm at the hospital

11
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:20,263
Hospital! Are you okay?

12
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:21,773
Ya, I'm OK

13
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:23,103
So, what's wrong then?

14
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,753
Just hang in there. I'm coming

15
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:38,113
By the way, Akash is back in Bombay.
I'll bring him along

16
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:41,663
He won't come

17
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,653
Don't be silly. Forget what happened

18
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,563
He'll be very happy to
know you're here.

19
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:14,853
Ya Sameer, tell me

20
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:28,763
Maybe you should go meet him alone.
I don't want to come.

21
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:33,983
You are right.
Let bygones be bygones...

22
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:36,953
But what's happening now
isn't wrong either, is it?

23
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,713
I am living my life and Sid his

24
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:43,523
I really think you should
go meet him alone

25
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:18,593
Sameer, come home quickly.
Now. At once

26
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:40,483
Sameer! Akash! What's wrong?
What's the rush?

27
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:47,743
How do you like it?

28
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:50,293
Have you gone mad?

29
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:54,053
On the phone you sounded like somebody's
broken into your house!

30
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:56,333
What do you mean beautiful!?

31
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:12,583
But Sid... don't you think
she resembles someone?

32
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:14,673
Resembles whom?

33
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:17,823
What do you think, Sameer?

34
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:20,783
I think everybody resembles
some one or the other.

35
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,813
But she resembles Miss. Kashyap

36
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:26,663
Our Economics teacher?

37
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,023
Yes, sir. Our Economics teacher

38
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:30,663
No man!

39
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:35,163
Ya man. I know Miss. Kashyap
better than you

40
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:38,893
Tuitions...

41
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:41,603
I used to go to her for tuitions

42
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,783
At these tuitions, were there other
students or just the two of you?

43
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:53,013
What do you think?
- Just the two of you?

44
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:56,883
You are right, Akash

45
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:01,783
She does resemble Miss. Kashyap.
But guess where I've messed up?

46
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:04,623
You've got her figure wrong

47
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,463
What do you know about her figure?

48
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,343
I'm looking for Sid

49
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,193
Sinha... Siddharth Sinha

50
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:28,843
When did you return to Bombay?
- This morning.

51
00:10:32,324 --> 00:10:33,623
Can't imagine what 'd have
happened if I wasn't here

52
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:36,253
How is she now?

53
00:10:37,694 --> 00:10:41,093
Don't know. It's hard to say

54
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:48,163
Tell me about you.
What're you up to these days?

55
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:53,103
I'm working with Dad in his
computer business

56
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:56,473
Everything else is the same...

57
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:06,583
And you? Still at your uncle's place
in Poona?

58
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:14,253
Ya. It's a very nice.
You must come there sometime

59
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:15,593
Definitely man

60
00:11:16,564 --> 00:11:18,123
Are you just saying that or
do you really intend on coming?

61
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:23,163
I intend on doing a lot of things
...like getting married

62
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:38,783
I always knew that the first to ge
married among us three would be you

63
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:42,953
Guess what! So is Akash

64
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,963
What! Akash! Getting married!?
That's funny

65
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:48,923
I'm not kidding!

66
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:51,893
No way!

67
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:03,683
But to whom? That girl who was
crazy about him in college?

68
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:05,643
Don't you remember her?

69
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:07,673
She used to say Akash's name
in that peculiar way!

70
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:14,713
God! Deepa is coming here!

71
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:27,473
Akash, let's dance. It'll make the
other couples jealous

72
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:31,773
Sure! Why not! Go ahead.
I'll be right with you

73
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:42,113
In three lifetimes from now

74
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:07,133
Sameer, please get me a drink.
I'm ever so thirsty

75
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,673
And throw in a dance or two with
Deepa while you're at it

76
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:23,423
What're you sketching?

77
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:53,443
Priya, isn't Sameer taking too
long to get your drink?

78
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:07,703
Did somebody just die?
- Yes... you!

79
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:11,533
Did I send you to get a drink
or chat up other girls!

80
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:15,203
I'm sure you have something
going on with her

81
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:19,883
I remember you were never home
when I was away on holiday

82
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,653
You've got it all wrong, Priya

83
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,113
How do you know her?

84
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:31,883
Did somebody just die?

85
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:38,233
Who is she?
- I don't know

86
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:40,303
You must have seen her somewhere!

87
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,433
That I have.
- Where?

88
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:46,733
She's over there

89
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:05,993
Priya, do you know her?

90
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,193
Forget it man. She doesn't
seem your type

91
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:12,993
I don't plan on marrying her!
Big deal about my type

92
00:15:13,304 --> 00:15:14,963
And may I know what your type is?

93
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:17,543
One who lives her life
and lets me live mine

94
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:19,743
Someone not overtly emotional

95
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:23,643
Oh, I remember.
You once met such a girl

96
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,083
The affair lasted for two weeks!

97
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:27,473
That itself was too much

98
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:29,283
Anyway, I'm off...

99
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:33,013
...or she'll have had grandchildren
by the time I get there

100
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,853
Think about it.
I don't see her biting the hook

101
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:43,763
It's called the good-ole
Akash charm and it never fails

102
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:55,233
Is the mike leaking., where has 3 gone?

103
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:03,483
Today, on this all important
graduation day...

104
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,783
I have decided to sing a song

105
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:20,073
And because we are stepping
into a new world...

106
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:25,403
...where the responsibility to be
somebody will be thrust on us...

107
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:29,373
The title of the song is:
"A hundred ways to get a job"

108
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,923
Relax guys! I was only kidding!

109
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:09,243
If people say... that we are crazy,
then let them

110
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:23,393
We don't give a damn
about what they think

111
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:28,303
When we can play music
When we can sing...

112
00:17:28,504 --> 00:17:31,173
Then why should we hesitate?

113
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:45,083
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

114
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:48,313
If the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

115
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:49,963
If the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

116
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:52,053
If the world fights...
- Just it fight.

117
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:53,823
Just keep right on singing

118
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:55,693
If the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

119
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:57,493
If ties are broken...
- Let them break

120
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,233
If someone leaves you...
- Let them go

121
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,103
Don't ever be afraid
We are today.

122
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:06,573
Why should our style be old?

123
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:36,543
There's lightning in our eyes.
A storm in our breath

124
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:43,973
What's fear, what's defeat?
We don't know what they mean

125
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:51,483
The earth and sky,
are created for us

126
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:58,363
I'm sure we could even
pluck the stars out of the night

127
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:05,133
Our abode is beyond the sky

128
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:12,473
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

129
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:49,283
We have been raised in the
land of dreams

130
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:56,783
We can be as shy as
we are openly affectionate

131
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:04,293
Mesmerising everybody
wherever we go...

132
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:11,463
...teaching you lovely women
the art of love

133
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:17,803
We know how to steal
a woman's heart and her sleep

134
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:25,483
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

135
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:33,223
If people say...
...that we are crazy, then let them

136
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:46,833
We don't give a damn
about what they think

137
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:52,103
When we can play music
When we can sing...

138
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:54,833
Then why should we hesitate?

139
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:09,453
We will sing the melody
that's in our hearts

140
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,293
If the world gets angry...
- Let it be angry

141
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:14,163
If the world quarrels...
- Let it quarrel

142
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:15,993
If the world fights...
- Let it fight

143
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:17,793
Just keep right on singing

144
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:19,803
If the world sulks...
- Let it sulk

145
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,473
If ties are broken...
- Let them break

146
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:23,233
If someone leaves you...
- Let them go

147
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:25,133
Don't ever be afraid

148
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:30,803
We are today.
Why should our style be old?

149
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:39,873
Shalini... that's a lovely name

150
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,283
I haven't seen you before.
You're not from our college

151
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:48,123
You're right. I'm here with somebody

152
00:22:48,724 --> 00:22:52,133
And now would you say yes to
dancing with this somebody?

153
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,363
The fact is that Rohit...

154
00:22:55,564 --> 00:22:58,093
Rohit! Okay!
So you are Rohit's sister?

155
00:22:58,704 --> 00:22:59,793
No. Actually I...

156
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:05,743
Rohit and I are very good friends.
Why, he's more like a brother

157
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:16,153
Not even if I told you
that I love you?

158
00:23:19,294 --> 00:23:22,263
Yes, Shalini. I love you
and only you

159
00:23:22,894 --> 00:23:23,693
My every breath...

160
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:25,323
...every heartbeat...

161
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,793
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

162
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:33,403
I'm sure that I was born
so that I could love you

163
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:36,833
And you were born to become mine

164
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:38,313
You are mine, Shalini

165
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,473
And if you ask your heart...

166
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:44,243
...you will know that I speak
the truth.

167
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:02,023
Who are you?

168
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:04,403
Don't you recognize your brother Rohit?

169
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:11,703
You are Rohit? I mean,
you too- are Rohit?

170
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:15,673
I thought Shalini was that
other Rohit's sister.

171
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,873
Look, he's over there

172
00:24:28,524 --> 00:24:31,553
Sameer...! Your name is Sameer?

173
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:36,463
So you've being lying to me all along!
That's really wrong of you

174
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,103
What can I say now...
You can see for yourself

175
00:24:42,644 --> 00:24:44,833
He got me to believe that
his name was Rohit

176
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,013
Neither is he Rohit
nor Shalini my sister

177
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,913
Shalini is my fiancee

178
00:24:54,454 --> 00:24:55,043
Fiancee...!

179
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:01,923
I don't like you being friends
with Akash at all

180
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:07,063
His behaviour the other night...
You know how embarrassed I was?

181
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:09,563
Let him do what he wants.

182
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:10,963
Just keep away from him

183
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,443
But Akash is my friend, Priya!

184
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:17,503
Like you don't have
any other friends?

185
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:19,943
Yes, I do... But he...

186
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:23,913
Just decide, Sameer. You can
either be with Akash or me!

187
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:31,283
I am thinking...

188
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:34,783
You need time to think
if you want to be with me!

189
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:40,193
Okay. So you want some time?

190
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:40,963
No!

191
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:46,833
I'm going out with friends.
I'll be back by 2.00

192
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:52,073
If I don't hear from you before that,
I'll know what your answer is

193
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:59,013
Don't you think you are
over-reacting?

194
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:02,013
No

195
00:26:03,154 --> 00:26:08,613
You've never seen me over-react.
If I do... then God help you!!

196
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:31,773
What are you doing!

197
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:37,213
Your bruise has turned a strange colour.
Have you seen it, Sid?

198
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:39,483
I'm glad you like it!
Do you want one?

199
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:43,623
Hey! Don't get that anger out on me man

200
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,723
Did I ask you to speak to Shalini?

201
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:50,993
No. But you could've at least helped me.
You just sat there!

202
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:55,103
Such a true friend! I think I'd be
better off befriending Rohit

203
00:26:55,214 --> 00:26:56,473
I'd at least get some protection!

204
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,473
May God bless your unity. I'm off.

205
00:27:02,014 --> 00:27:04,143
Where to? -Home.

206
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:06,383
Why? What's the hurry?
Right, Sameer?

207
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,813
Ya, man, chill. It's only
1'O' clock

208
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:12,583
In which country?
It's nearly 4 here!

209
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:32,543
I forgot to call Priya!

210
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:37,783
Why are you so scared of Priya?

211
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:39,143
I'm not scared of her

212
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:42,853
I don't want to hurt her
or lose her

213
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:46,923
Sameer, I can't understand
how you tolerate her

214
00:27:47,294 --> 00:27:48,783
She seems more a boss
than a girlfriend!

215
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:53,933
Akash, I'm asking for help,
not your expert comments

216
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:54,763
What should I do?

217
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:56,793
What do you think?

218
00:27:57,674 --> 00:28:00,263
I'll tell you what.
Call Priya and apologise

219
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,933
Tell her you will never meet
Akash again

220
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:05,473
You know I won't do that!

221
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:08,043
What if she gets hurt...
What if you lose her!

222
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:11,983
You'll never improve, will you

223
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:16,683
Why are you turning this
into such an issue?

224
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:22,953
Just call her, talk to her.
It'll all be okay

225
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:51,383
The thing is... but listen... You're not
...but I... what I'm saying...

226
00:28:53,094 --> 00:28:54,083
I'm at Akash's

227
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:00,363
She hung up

228
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:02,223
What did you expect?

229
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:04,163
She'll say Sorry darling!

230
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:08,743
Enough is enough, Sameer.
Listen to me

231
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:11,203
Just go there and tell her
these tantrums won't work

232
00:29:11,644 --> 00:29:14,813
If she wants to be with you,
she must follow your wishes

233
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:16,943
She's challenged your
self-respect, buddy

234
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,883
What are you doing? Be a man!

235
00:29:26,924 --> 00:29:28,923
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
- That's the way to go!

236
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:42,043
He's dead!

237
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,773
Oh, Priya?
- Please give Sameer the phone

238
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:54,623
But Sameer hasn't come here. I too am
looking for him since last night

239
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:56,083
What? Didn't he come there?

240
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,153
Careful man!
Only this eye is working

241
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:15,503
We need to talk

242
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,173
There's no need for that. I know
what you have to say

243
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,043
You know? - Yes

244
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:22,953
I spoke to Akash after our talk

245
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:24,343
Right! And?

246
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,073
He said you weren't at his house

247
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:31,283
Stop pretending! I can't believe
I did this to myself

248
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,493
I never knew you were such a liar

249
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,023
I don't want to see your
face ever again!

250
00:31:11,634 --> 00:31:12,723
Could I be of any assistance?

251
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,703
It's not a problem at all

252
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:04,773
Oh God! What's in here?
- My things

253
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:06,653
Hang on. I'll get it from this side

254
00:32:32,544 --> 00:32:36,003
If just one suitcase has reduced
us to this condition, then...

255
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:37,943
There's only two more like this

256
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:41,313
Is that all? Just two more?
Let's go

257
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:05,603
It's a nice house

258
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:14,313
It belongs to the company I work for

259
00:33:17,524 --> 00:33:20,253
I am an interior designer...
Tara Jaiswal

260
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:26,693
What do you do?

261
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,493
I work as a porter on Sundays

262
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:34,063
And the rest of the week?

263
00:33:34,914 --> 00:33:37,603
Normally if anyone asks me that, I say
anything that pops into my head

264
00:33:38,644 --> 00:33:41,843
But I'll tell you the truth because
I think it might be of interest to you

265
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:43,943
I don't quite understand?

266
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:47,843
I mean you have three paintings in your
luggage and that's my vocation

267
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,063
May I see your paintings?

268
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:58,053
Of course

269
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,093
Where do you live?

270
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:04,663
The last house down this road.
You can come whenever you wish

271
00:34:08,374 --> 00:34:11,313
Sid, I'm going to the office.
- Just a minute, Ma

272
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,373
I'm coming along. Just drop me off
at Sameer's

273
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:22,353
By the way, it's Anju's wedding
anniversary today

274
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:24,443
She'll be very disappointed
if you don't come

275
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:34,033
Is Siddharth home? - Yes

276
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:37,433
You are...? - I am Tara

277
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:43,463
Ma, this is Tara

278
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:48,503
Well, I'd better be going

279
00:34:49,484 --> 00:34:51,113
Ya, you go ahead, I'll go myself.

280
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:53,143
All right. But you are coming
this evening, aren't you?

281
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:55,943
Where? - To Anju's!

282
00:34:57,964 --> 00:34:59,123
Mom, I get extremely bored there

283
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:03,693
There are very few places in this world
where you don't get bored

284
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,593
Fine! Have it your way.

285
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,533
Please have a seat

286
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:15,803
I'd like to see your paintings first

287
00:35:55,114 --> 00:35:56,173
The same theme here too

288
00:35:58,924 --> 00:35:59,353
What theme?

289
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,753
I have learnt something about
you today

290
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:10,993
Something I couldn't see
at our first meeting

291
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:13,923
What's that?

292
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,573
The thing is, you meet people,
talk to them, laugh...

293
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:25,463
But there's a world within you...

294
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:28,873
...full of dreams, of fantasies...

295
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:33,913
...that you don't share with anyone

296
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:40,913
I wonder if those, who claim
to know you...

297
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:43,983
...really know you at all

298
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:49,403
What makes you say that?

299
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:57,113
The door is not open...
Entry is forbidden...

300
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:01,113
The box is tightly bound...
No one can steal anything...

301
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:07,953
And who can tell what feelings reflect
behind those shut eyelids...

302
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:14,583
I wonder what other secrets your
paintings hide within them...

303
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,933
Or within you perhaps

304
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:24,903
Why are you looking at me
like that?

305
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:29,273
Anyway, which do you think
is your best?

306
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:33,703
I have yet to create that one

307
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:20,483
Look at your face!
White as a sheet!

308
00:38:23,164 --> 00:38:25,633
Look, I am very angry right now
and all because of you

309
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:28,963
Hey! I saved your life and
you are angry with me?

310
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:30,923
Saved my life?
- Absolutely!

311
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,633
This was bound to happen

312
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,503
Priya would've left you tomorrow
if not today. Know why?

313
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:39,343
Because she didn't love you,
she loved some other Sameer

314
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:42,243
He looked like you but was
someone else

315
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:46,183
You are not that- Sameer. You are the
Sameer I know, Sid knows...

316
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,813
And Priya could only hope to know

317
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:52,693
If you became that Sameer, our this
Sameer would be defeated!

318
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,223
I never thought of it like that...
- I know

319
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:02,063
Then pack your bags and let's go

320
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:03,903
Sid and I are waiting for you
in the car

321
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,643
Where are we going? - Goa!

322
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:06,863
Goa...?!

323
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,613
The heart wants...

324
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:22,143
The heart wants...

325
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:31,393
May these sparkling days never end

326
00:39:34,934 --> 00:39:35,903
The heart wants...

327
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:40,633
May we never have to be
without our friends

328
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:47,733
May our days be full of poetry...

329
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:52,223
...our evenings dance and
nights sing.

330
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:58,883
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

331
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:09,563
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

332
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:12,893
The heart wants...

333
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:17,673
May these sparkling days
never end

334
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:22,243
The heart wants...

335
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,743
May we never have to be
without our friends

336
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:33,863
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

337
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:38,263
May this joy and light
be ours by right

338
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:53,763
Where's Akash?

339
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:57,873
There... behind the plant

340
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:04,383
Are you guys staying here too?

341
00:42:04,584 --> 00:42:07,483
Not are... we were.
We are checking out

342
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:14,233
We've been staying here for a week.
Isn't that right, guys?

343
00:42:15,264 --> 00:42:16,493
Yes, we've been here for a week

344
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:18,823
But Akash just got here today.
- Yes. I got here today

345
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,033
Akash! It's nice to see you haven't
lost your sense of humour!

346
00:43:38,954 --> 00:43:41,003
Hey Sid, look over there!

347
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:59,533
Sid, did you hear that?
Someone's calling out my name

348
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:15,183
Go faster, buddy. Faster
This is the top speed

349
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:53,882
What an amazing place!

350
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:04,462
We should come to Goa every year,
for a week at least

351
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:08,392
What say, Sid?

352
00:45:13,573 --> 00:45:14,232
What are you thinking?

353
00:45:16,943 --> 00:45:18,142
I'm looking at that ship...

354
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,852
...that's about to disappear over
the horizon

355
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,942
The three of us are like that ship

356
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:29,612
Soon, we'll set out looking
for our destinations...

357
00:45:32,193 --> 00:45:35,132
...and it might just be that
our destinations are different

358
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,862
I don't understand why
you're saying all this

359
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:46,442
Sid, we are all friends...

360
00:45:49,143 --> 00:45:49,872
...for life

361
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:50,942
Of course we are

362
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:53,712
But who knows where life will
take each one of us

363
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,982
Ever wondered, let alone come
here every year for a week...

364
00:45:59,853 --> 00:46:01,582
It may be difficult to meet
even once in 10 years

365
00:46:07,193 --> 00:46:08,022
That won't happen, Sid

366
00:46:10,863 --> 00:46:15,892
We were, are and will be friends.
Always

367
00:46:19,773 --> 00:46:23,002
Anyway, shall we go?
Deepa must be waiting for you

368
00:46:24,513 --> 00:46:27,142
Don't say must be waiting.
She is!

369
00:46:29,023 --> 00:46:32,972
I told her Akash will meet her
by the poolside at 8 sharp!

370
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,592
How strange is this journey!

371
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:48,732
If you just think...
Each one of us is so unaware...

372
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:52,832
...of where he is destined to go...

373
00:46:53,073 --> 00:46:58,672
...of what the future
holds for each of us

374
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:18,192
The heart wants...

375
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:22,862
May these sparkling days never end

376
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,332
The heart wants...

377
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:32,112
May we never have to be
without our friends

378
00:47:35,623 --> 00:47:39,022
May our days be full of poetry...

379
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,492
...our evenings dance
and nights sing

380
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:50,462
May our time together always
be fun and exciting

381
00:47:54,373 --> 00:48:01,472
May every path we tread
bring us happiness

382
00:48:03,243 --> 00:48:06,682
Our paths dazzle with their glitter

383
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:11,182
May this joy and light
be ours by right

384
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:17,952
Deepa, why do you like Akash
so much?

385
00:49:19,153 --> 00:49:19,642
What do you mean?

386
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:26,762
Sometimes I wonder why we
like and want someone

387
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:29,422
Why do you like him?

388
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:35,172
I don't know... I just do

389
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,702
Even knowing that Akash...
...doesn't love me

390
00:49:44,383 --> 00:49:46,352
Yes... then too

391
00:49:55,063 --> 00:49:56,852
Deepa you are a good-Iooking,
intelligent girl.

392
00:49:58,433 --> 00:49:59,552
You can get anyone you want...

393
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:02,962
In that case, why can't
I have Akash!

394
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:09,132
I don't know that...

395
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:15,162
But I do know that if
you're ever in trouble,

396
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,202
And need Akash's help or support,
he'll do whatever he can for you.

397
00:50:20,253 --> 00:50:22,082
But Deepa, you shouldn't
hope for things that...

398
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:32,822
Take a look at this sand

399
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:36,562
The tighter you try to grip it...

400
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:39,262
...the faster it slips
through your fingers

401
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:16,972
Have you donated your bag
to the hotel?

402
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:20,402
Actually, I've decided to
stay back for a few days

403
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:22,182
What?

404
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,672
Er... Kristine wants me to stay
for some more time

405
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:28,342
Kristine? that girl who...

406
00:51:30,223 --> 00:51:33,552
Sid! Are you listening? Our friend has
decided to become a hippie!

407
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:45,002
If you hadn't brought me here,
I'd have never met her

408
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:51,402
She's Swiss. I was wondering...
why not go there...

409
00:51:52,313 --> 00:51:55,942
...and start a bee farm.
Swiss honey is world famous...

410
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,382
Let's go Akash

411
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:20,932
What have I done! He was
better off with Priya

412
00:52:21,443 --> 00:52:22,402
One more thing...

413
00:52:23,843 --> 00:52:26,572
Please don't call my house
till I get back

414
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,632
So, did you have fun in Goa?

415
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,972
It was great. Have you been there?

416
00:53:00,713 --> 00:53:02,902
Yes. Many years ago

417
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:11,952
Whose photographs are these?

418
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:16,582
Esha... my daughter

419
00:53:18,063 --> 00:53:21,522
Oh, I haven't met her.
Where is she?

420
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:26,132
She lives with her father

421
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:36,432
9th April 95... exactly
on my birthday...

422
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:39,412
My husband gave me a gift...

423
00:53:54,203 --> 00:53:55,562
You do meet your daughter,
don't you?

424
00:53:57,703 --> 00:53:58,192
No

425
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:03,662
The Court doesn't permit me
to meet my daughter

426
00:54:05,143 --> 00:54:05,972
Why?

427
00:54:07,883 --> 00:54:09,872
My ex-husband is a very rich man

428
00:54:11,113 --> 00:54:13,102
His lawyers were very smart and
capable

429
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:19,352
With the help of many false
witnesses, he proved...

430
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:26,382
...that I am not a good mother.
That I'm an alcoholic

431
00:54:29,263 --> 00:54:32,032
An irresponsible woman
who drinks

432
00:54:35,073 --> 00:54:36,062
You're nothing like that!

433
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,872
Oh for you to have been
the judge!

434
00:54:45,413 --> 00:54:47,712
Anyway, what else
did you do there?

435
00:54:51,593 --> 00:54:53,052
I'd like to paint you

436
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,722
Paint me?

437
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:13,272
Be back in two minutes

438
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:00,252
Are you going somewhere?

439
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,112
Sorry, I have to go

440
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:06,152
I just got a call from the site.
There's a problem

441
00:56:44,303 --> 00:56:46,292
Have you given any thought
to your future?

442
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:49,662
No

443
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:53,372
I know it's my fault...

444
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:58,512
...I always thought, I'd give
you some time... You needed it.

445
00:57:00,323 --> 00:57:02,042
It's my pampering that
has spoilt you

446
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:04,682
If this goes on...

447
00:57:04,893 --> 00:57:07,912
You'll definitely have signed
a cheque till my retirement

448
00:57:08,723 --> 00:57:12,022
Dad, there are more things
to life than signing cheques

449
00:57:12,393 --> 00:57:16,062
Really! And what are these things?

450
00:57:18,273 --> 00:57:20,792
I don't know yet but the moment
I do, you'll be the first to know

451
00:57:25,343 --> 00:57:26,272
I have had enough of your jokes

452
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:30,702
I've decided that you will go
to Australia

453
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:32,842
Cool! Another holiday?

454
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,472
You'll manage our business
there

455
00:57:36,893 --> 00:57:38,982
Mom, Dad's joking now

456
00:57:39,453 --> 00:57:42,822
No, Akash. Dad is serious
and you better be serious too

457
00:57:44,763 --> 00:57:45,592
You are going to Sydney

458
00:57:47,203 --> 00:57:50,062
And you will manage the office there

459
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:05,202
Sameerji's Mummyji is on the phone

460
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:09,822
Akash Baba says that...

461
00:58:12,963 --> 00:58:13,442
Yes, Aunty

462
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,492
What's wrong with Sameer?

463
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:18,092
Nothing's wrong with Sameer.
He's perfectly OK

464
00:58:18,293 --> 00:58:20,092
What OK!? He's shut himself
in his room

465
00:58:20,303 --> 00:58:22,662
He hasn't eaten and just
doesn't come out

466
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:24,332
Sameer is in Bombay?

467
00:58:25,373 --> 00:58:26,602
Didn't you all come back
last night

468
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:31,362
Yes, Aunty. It was last night
but... I'm so distracted now...

469
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:33,512
Akash, are you and Sameer on drugs?

470
00:58:33,813 --> 00:58:37,472
Of course not, Aunty. Don't worry.
I'll be there right away

471
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:49,222
The least you could've done was call.

472
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:50,362
I didn't know what to say to your Mom

473
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,102
What's happened to you?

474
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:06,472
I'm in no mood to talk now

475
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:13,752
Okay. How's Kristine?

476
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:15,142
Don't even mention her name
in front of me!

477
00:59:16,923 --> 00:59:17,482
Why? What happened?

478
00:59:25,163 --> 00:59:25,892
Get it off your chest

479
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,502
It's not good for health
to suppress such emotions

480
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:38,572
Well, after the two of left
the other day...

481
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,672
I met Kristine on the beach

482
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,012
It felt so good...

483
00:59:47,653 --> 00:59:49,742
Just Kristine and me...

484
00:59:55,323 --> 00:59:56,552
I loved her so much...

485
00:59:59,063 --> 00:59:59,862
How happy I was...

486
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:30,122
We watched the sunset and she
came back to the hotel with me

487
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,392
I invited her in

488
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,062
I could never have imagined
what happened next

489
01:01:30,493 --> 01:01:32,392
I don't think she was from
Switzerland either

490
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:36,922
I'm glad to have amused you guys!

491
01:01:37,693 --> 01:01:40,792
That truck driver who gave me a ride
to Bombay was far more sympathetic!

492
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:42,692
You came back in a truck!?

493
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,632
What did you think?
That I sit on this pillow every day?

494
01:01:47,773 --> 01:01:50,292
I'm pissed off travelling 12 hours
in a truck

495
01:02:25,913 --> 01:02:30,002
Mother, he is Mr. Shankaran.
Art India magazines.

496
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:40,552
I was telling Siddharth about
my friend who lives in Kasauli

497
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:43,982
He hosts a painting workshop
every year

498
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:45,862
And you feel that he must
go there

499
01:02:46,233 --> 01:02:47,032
Absolutely

500
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,392
It'll be a very good experience
for him

501
01:02:58,573 --> 01:02:59,062
Oh, you're here!

502
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:04,402
You're a strange boy!
you invite me and act surprised when I come.

503
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,052
Ma, this is Tara!
Tara Jaiswal. You introduced us before

504
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:34,782
How long will you go around
with that glum face...

505
01:03:35,613 --> 01:03:39,242
Come. Let me introduce you
to these sweet girls

506
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:40,912
Forget it man.

507
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,552
I'm not in the mood

508
01:03:44,953 --> 01:03:45,852
Are you fine?

509
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:52,622
Look... Kristine!

510
01:04:10,783 --> 01:04:11,612
Do you like it?

511
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:15,952
I like them all

512
01:04:17,593 --> 01:04:21,152
It's difficult to say
which one is your best

513
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:24,692
I haven't painted my best yet

514
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:26,822
Why not?

515
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,862
You don't seem to have the time?

516
01:04:32,503 --> 01:04:37,372
On such a big day in your life
I've to agree to your wish.

517
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:41,482
Tell me, when you will
start my painting?

518
01:04:42,183 --> 01:04:42,652
Tomorrow

519
01:04:55,493 --> 01:04:57,322
Wait, I'll be out in a minute.

520
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:58,822
- No problem

521
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:29,682
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

522
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:44,542
What season is this in which the
heart blooms like a flower.

523
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:48,372
...in which the colours merge...

524
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,912
...and all the fragrances
blend

525
01:05:52,423 --> 01:05:55,982
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

526
01:05:56,293 --> 01:05:59,782
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

527
01:05:59,993 --> 01:06:05,392
They all seem favourable to me

528
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:18,602
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

529
01:06:26,423 --> 01:06:27,412
Oh look!

530
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:31,522
Banks of a river...

531
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:38,952
A bird calls out
to another bird

532
01:06:41,533 --> 01:06:46,602
Look, at the river itself...

533
01:06:48,013 --> 01:06:54,102
She flows on to unite
with the sea

534
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:01,612
All these journeys
are part of love's caravan

535
01:07:04,323 --> 01:07:11,782
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

536
01:07:49,773 --> 01:07:51,002
Oh how

537
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:55,502
can I explain...

538
01:07:56,113 --> 01:08:02,342
How can I make you understand
what love is!

539
01:08:04,783 --> 01:08:10,522
There are no attachments
in love

540
01:08:11,223 --> 01:08:17,682
And neither
are there any barriers

541
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:26,032
Love's saga is extraordinary

542
01:08:27,573 --> 01:08:35,212
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

543
01:08:35,413 --> 01:08:38,712
...in which all the colours merge...

544
01:08:38,923 --> 01:08:42,222
...and all the fragrances
blend

545
01:08:42,693 --> 01:08:46,152
Moonlight, brooks
and clouds...

546
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,052
Songs, rain
and butterflies...

547
01:08:50,263 --> 01:08:56,392
They all seem favourable to me

548
01:08:57,943 --> 01:09:05,402
What season is this in which
the heart blooms like a flower

549
01:09:50,093 --> 01:09:50,822
Greetings, Aunty.

550
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:56,462
Are you going out, Sameer?

551
01:09:56,663 --> 01:09:58,332
Ya, to Akash's... Why?

552
01:10:02,843 --> 01:10:03,632
I'll be back

553
01:10:16,953 --> 01:10:17,972
Mom! What's the matter?

554
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:20,912
The fact is, Nareshji's daughter
Pooja is coming here

555
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:25,162
And we want the two of you to...

556
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:27,992
What! Fixing my marriage...!

557
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:31,832
An arranged marriage!
No, Mom. Not for me

558
01:10:32,033 --> 01:10:35,162
Why not? Your Daddy and I had
an arranged marriage

559
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:40,162
Listen to me. We are not forcing
you to get married

560
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:42,002
We have known them for years

561
01:10:42,213 --> 01:10:44,512
And we thought we'd turn friendship
into a marriage alliance

562
01:10:45,883 --> 01:10:48,352
You don't lose anything by
meeting Pooja, do you?

563
01:10:51,023 --> 01:10:54,722
Okay. But you know my answer.
And that's NO!

564
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,692
Who is it, Sameer?

565
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,852
Er... Sameer, we have something
important to discuss

566
01:11:29,393 --> 01:11:30,722
Nareshji, is that all right?

567
01:11:32,733 --> 01:11:35,752
Anyway, they'll get bored
sitting with us oldies

568
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:00,922
Are they your friends?

569
01:12:01,563 --> 01:12:02,022
Please sit down

570
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:09,422
This is Akash and this is Sid

571
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:12,102
Seems like a deep friendship

572
01:12:12,433 --> 01:12:15,272
Either the friendship is deep
or it's a 3-D photograph

573
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:37,622
Pooja, you do know why
you're here, don't you?

574
01:12:38,663 --> 01:12:41,392
Yes. Mom and Dad told me

575
01:12:44,973 --> 01:12:46,962
Look, honestly speaking...

576
01:12:47,173 --> 01:12:50,902
When Mom told me about this...
I felt it wasn't right at first...

577
01:12:51,513 --> 01:12:55,812
...but now... I'm so happy you said no to
this arranged marriage bullshit!

578
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:04,312
I think marriages shouldn't be
made like this

579
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:07,322
It's so important to love somebody
to get married

580
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:08,782
What do you think?

581
01:13:09,023 --> 01:13:10,152
Yes, absolutely

582
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:13,992
Why? Are you in love with
someone?

583
01:13:27,043 --> 01:13:28,472
There is this guy in my life

584
01:13:28,883 --> 01:13:31,572
But I guess I don't love him
enough so far to marry him

585
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:34,112
I pretty much feel the same...

586
01:13:35,753 --> 01:13:37,412
...but not about the guy in your life!

587
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:44,522
And then?

588
01:13:45,533 --> 01:13:47,362
Then what!
She went home

589
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:51,692
It's a problem man

590
01:14:01,543 --> 01:14:04,202
Please don't tell me you've
fallen for her after all this!

591
01:14:08,423 --> 01:14:08,882
Look, Sameer...

592
01:14:09,423 --> 01:14:11,382
I have no doubt whatsoever
you have fallen in love with her

593
01:14:11,923 --> 01:14:14,052
But I'm equally sure that after
3 months...

594
01:14:14,253 --> 01:14:15,412
...you'll be in love with some other
girl

595
01:14:16,193 --> 01:14:16,882
No, Akash

596
01:14:19,433 --> 01:14:22,552
I always thought I knew
what love was

597
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:24,592
I realized today that I was
completely wrong

598
01:14:25,473 --> 01:14:25,902
Is that so!

599
01:14:27,373 --> 01:14:30,232
Akash, when Pooja told me about
that guy in her life...

600
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:33,802
For the first time I thought about
all those girls in my life...

601
01:14:34,113 --> 01:14:35,572
I was attracted to all of them...

602
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,032
But I was wrong to think
the attraction was love

603
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:42,082
And now you love Pooja?

604
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:46,722
Yes. That's it!
I love Pooja

605
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:49,422
Then tell her

606
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:54,692
Take my advice. Don't say
anything to anyone

607
01:14:55,633 --> 01:14:56,602
There's no trusting you

608
01:14:56,803 --> 01:14:58,262
Today it's Pooja,
tomorrow it'll be some Ahuja!

609
01:15:15,153 --> 01:15:17,122
How did you know it's
my birthday?

610
01:15:18,493 --> 01:15:19,782
Didn't you mention it?

611
01:15:21,223 --> 01:15:22,782
I am so happy today

612
01:15:24,163 --> 01:15:28,122
Guess what? Esha called me

613
01:15:31,503 --> 01:15:33,302
She is coming to see me today

614
01:15:35,473 --> 01:15:36,902
My daughter is coming here...

615
01:15:48,883 --> 01:15:51,152
Sid, she remembered it's
my birthday today

616
01:15:54,863 --> 01:15:57,982
I'll be seeing her after 5 years!

617
01:15:59,563 --> 01:16:02,322
I've cooked everything myself.
I baked a cake

618
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:05,832
I'm so happy

619
01:16:06,373 --> 01:16:08,992
Is Esha coming alone or your...

620
01:16:09,443 --> 01:16:14,502
Oh no. She told him she's going to
a friend's birthday party...

621
01:16:14,873 --> 01:16:18,672
Because Ajay will never let her
come here

622
01:16:22,623 --> 01:16:23,582
Would you like to meet her?

623
01:16:26,193 --> 01:16:26,852
It'll make me happy

624
01:16:34,563 --> 01:16:38,192
How dare you teach my daughter
to lie? Have you no shame?

625
01:16:40,573 --> 01:16:44,372
Thank God I heard Esha
talk to you over the phone

626
01:16:44,743 --> 01:16:46,712
Why don't you stay away from her?

627
01:16:47,413 --> 01:16:48,702
I am her mother!

628
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:52,542
You were her mother but now
Kiran is her mother

629
01:16:53,253 --> 01:16:55,042
It'd be wise of you to understand
this

630
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:58,212
Don't ever try to meet Esha again

631
01:16:58,753 --> 01:17:01,052
Not unless you want me to take
you to court... again

632
01:17:02,423 --> 01:17:03,862
You understand what I'm getting at,
don't you?

633
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:48,272
He tells me I am not Esha's mother!

634
01:17:48,473 --> 01:17:49,442
That Esha is not my daughter!

635
01:17:49,643 --> 01:17:56,272
I am her mother...

636
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:02,852
He married again

637
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:07,442
He destroyed all my dreams.
I said nothing

638
01:18:09,263 --> 01:18:11,282
Because I had everything...

639
01:18:13,363 --> 01:18:14,122
I had my Esha

640
01:18:23,613 --> 01:18:24,802
I have nothing at all

641
01:18:25,943 --> 01:18:34,512
I am nothing. Nothing.

642
01:18:57,243 --> 01:19:02,042
You know, crying doesn't suit
you at all

643
01:19:04,383 --> 01:19:05,852
What else can I do!

644
01:19:09,053 --> 01:19:10,352
You can come with me

645
01:20:05,213 --> 01:20:08,902
You two must be wondering where
Siddharth has brought you!

646
01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:11,742
No such thing. We'd go
anywhere to eat cake

647
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:20,582
Will you dance with me?

648
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:25,992
Where?
- Right here there's lot of space, come.

649
01:21:21,353 --> 01:21:22,322
Sid, we've reached your house

650
01:21:27,523 --> 01:21:28,992
What?

651
01:21:36,033 --> 01:21:37,162
You're joking, right?

652
01:21:42,203 --> 01:21:43,832
Hey Akash, he's serious man!

653
01:21:45,143 --> 01:21:46,512
Have you gone mad?

654
01:21:53,453 --> 01:21:55,852
Sid, my knowledge of such
things is a bit sad but...

655
01:21:56,553 --> 01:21:57,982
...this is a but much, isn't it?

656
01:22:00,763 --> 01:22:02,952
Is that because she's older?

657
01:22:03,393 --> 01:22:05,692
No. I mean that too

658
01:22:08,003 --> 01:22:09,692
Wait a minute! Why are we even
discussing this nonsense?

659
01:22:13,503 --> 01:22:16,372
Because I thought that may be
you guys would understand

660
01:22:22,843 --> 01:22:25,542
Hey Sid! Understand what?

661
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:31,382
You say you love a woman who
is 10 to 15 years older than you...

662
01:22:31,953 --> 01:22:34,892
...has a daughter, had a husband

663
01:22:35,963 --> 01:22:38,222
You've told us she has a
drinking problem

664
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:39,552
What should we understand?
- Just this...

665
01:22:40,003 --> 01:22:42,052
I know all this and still
love her

666
01:22:42,703 --> 01:22:46,532
But Sid, think about it.
This isn't love, it's insanity

667
01:22:46,743 --> 01:22:49,402
No. This is love

668
01:22:52,443 --> 01:22:54,742
I don't expect her to be mine
or marry me

669
01:22:55,113 --> 01:22:56,412
I don't expect any such thing

670
01:22:57,413 --> 01:22:59,742
Even if she doesn't love me,
it's okay because I...

671
01:22:59,953 --> 01:23:03,252
okay! I get it

672
01:23:04,553 --> 01:23:07,752
Remember, Sameer? Even I had
started off like this

673
01:23:08,563 --> 01:23:12,022
Started what off?
Oh. Of course.

674
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:16,102
Okay, Sid. If that's what it's about
then I have no objection

675
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:18,432
In fact she's perfect for you

676
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:23,102
She's experienced, lives alone.
You visit her everyday

677
01:23:24,913 --> 01:23:27,102
Learn from him, Sameer

678
01:23:27,443 --> 01:23:29,772
Really, Sid. You couldn't have
chosen better...

679
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:36,622
How disgusting can you get!

680
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:43,992
Here I am telling you I love her and
you make it sound so sick and dirty

681
01:23:49,133 --> 01:23:51,792
We don't have to approve
everything our friends do

682
01:23:53,303 --> 01:23:55,632
But there is a line in every
friendship that shouldn't be crossed

683
01:23:55,843 --> 01:23:57,272
And you have crossed it today

684
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:06,582
At some point in life everyone
experiences true love

685
01:24:08,783 --> 01:24:12,312
Then all the things you said...
about her age and stuff...

686
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:18,022
They don't mean anything.
They all seem trivial

687
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:23,422
You won't understand this today

688
01:24:26,203 --> 01:24:27,502
But some day you will know...

689
01:24:27,703 --> 01:24:29,572
You don't decide to fall in love

690
01:24:31,343 --> 01:24:32,312
It just happens

691
01:24:39,213 --> 01:24:40,342
Are you finished?

692
01:24:50,563 --> 01:24:51,392
Sameer, are you coming?

693
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,559
I still remember that night

694
01:25:49,709 --> 01:25:52,008
I never thought things would go
that far

695
01:25:58,419 --> 01:25:59,508
I couldn't sleep all night

696
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:02,578
I went and met Akash
the next morning

697
01:26:42,528 --> 01:26:44,357
These things happen
between friends

698
01:26:44,828 --> 01:26:48,157
Let's go meet Sid.
He must be feeling bad too

699
01:26:50,437 --> 01:26:52,336
You're sure to run into him
somewhere

700
01:26:52,737 --> 01:26:55,536
What'll you do? Ignore him?

701
01:27:02,147 --> 01:27:03,336
You're coming to meet Sid

702
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,006
Leave me alone, Sameer!

703
01:27:33,606 --> 01:27:34,575
I have to see Sid

704
01:27:34,906 --> 01:27:35,805
He's gone

705
01:27:36,016 --> 01:27:37,775
Where? - Kasauli

706
01:27:38,176 --> 01:27:43,045
They called yesterday to say his
application was accepted. So he...

707
01:27:46,056 --> 01:27:49,355
What is it, Sameer?
Is everything alright?

708
01:27:51,596 --> 01:27:54,455
Of course. I should go

709
01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:04,804
I didn't realise that things
would never be the same again

710
01:28:05,705 --> 01:28:10,114
You went to Kasauli... A week later,
Akash left for Australia

711
01:28:21,725 --> 01:28:22,954
Take care of yourself

712
01:28:23,495 --> 01:28:26,654
You remember the name of the man
who'll receive you in Sydney?

713
01:28:26,865 --> 01:28:29,984
Mr. Mehta... Relax, Dad.
I remember

714
01:28:35,634 --> 01:28:37,833
Bye. I'll call you from there

715
01:28:41,474 --> 01:28:43,403
I must tell you something
- What's it?

716
01:28:45,344 --> 01:28:52,213
I always made fun of your
endless romantic entanglements

717
01:28:54,424 --> 01:28:57,783
Never stopped to think how you
must feel

718
01:29:00,094 --> 01:29:03,253
You know I was just kidding,
don't you?

719
01:29:06,964 --> 01:29:07,993
Don't worry about it

720
01:29:08,663 --> 01:29:10,062
You weren't the only one who was
kidding

721
01:29:11,603 --> 01:29:12,692
You remember Shalini?

722
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:16,662
I remember Shalini...
And Rohit's punch as well

723
01:29:18,073 --> 01:29:19,802
I knew she was Rohit's fiancee

724
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:24,102
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you stop me?

725
01:29:51,572 --> 01:29:52,511
I said Hi

726
01:29:56,382 --> 01:29:57,311
Where are you going?

727
01:29:59,222 --> 01:30:00,651
This flight goes to Sydney

728
01:30:01,382 --> 01:30:02,411
But where are you going?

729
01:30:05,222 --> 01:30:07,381
How strange! All three of us
are going to Sydney

730
01:30:08,622 --> 01:30:09,091
Three?

731
01:30:09,492 --> 01:30:11,151
Sure. You, me, and this flight

732
01:30:15,402 --> 01:30:16,991
You do know you're insane,
don't you?

733
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:28,680
I'm really sorry about
the other night

734
01:30:30,251 --> 01:30:31,140
I was just kidding

735
01:30:39,721 --> 01:30:40,210
So what are you...

736
01:30:44,061 --> 01:30:45,580
What are you doing in Sydney?

737
01:30:46,661 --> 01:30:49,290
Dad has a business there he
wants me to manage...

738
01:30:50,001 --> 01:30:52,900
Let's see how long it lasts now.
And you?

739
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,199
My uncle lives there

740
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,939
My mother's brother.
I'm visiting him

741
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,369
He's nothing like Rohit, is he!

742
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:04,469
What does he do?

743
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:09,409
Have you been to Sydney before?

744
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,109
Do you always ask so many
questions?

745
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,949
Yes. Have you been to Sydney
before?

746
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:17,229
Yes

747
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:20,189
Good. You can show me around

748
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,959
Wait a minute. Don't you know
anybody else there?

749
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,029
Of course. There is a Mr. Mehta

750
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:29,838
And won't it be fun hanging out
with him?

751
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:35,378
I said I'm sorry

752
01:31:36,109 --> 01:31:38,338
Okay but I will have to ask
my uncle

753
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:42,108
But he won't refuse.

754
01:31:42,749 --> 01:31:43,218
Why?

755
01:31:43,989 --> 01:31:45,248
Because I have bought him a gift!

756
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:20,177
I'm fine but please stop
calling me uncle now

757
01:32:20,388 --> 01:32:22,717
You've grown up which makes us
practically the same age

758
01:32:34,038 --> 01:32:35,127
So, is it a business trip?

759
01:32:35,337 --> 01:32:39,096
We have an export business and
Dad's exported me here to handle it

760
01:32:39,307 --> 01:32:41,036
Exports? Sounds very boring, man

761
01:32:41,247 --> 01:32:42,076
That's what I think too

762
01:32:42,647 --> 01:32:44,666
Personally, I prefer something more
adventurous...

763
01:32:45,417 --> 01:32:46,606
...like wild life photography

764
01:32:46,987 --> 01:32:48,246
You like photography?

765
01:32:49,217 --> 01:32:53,586
Mum says the first word I said
wasn't Papa or Mama...

766
01:32:53,787 --> 01:32:54,616
It was camera!

767
01:32:58,897 --> 01:32:59,356
I'm Steve

768
01:33:00,427 --> 01:33:02,056
Steve? - Satyadev Mehta

769
01:33:04,837 --> 01:33:08,426
I've organized a car for you.
I'll get your trolley

770
01:33:10,906 --> 01:33:12,765
Okay Shalini, I'll take your leave.
Bye, Mahesh

771
01:33:14,576 --> 01:33:20,065
Here's my card. If you need
anything in Sydney, call me

772
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:49,774
Well, I'd better leave now.
I'm sure you want to rest

773
01:33:50,115 --> 01:33:52,074
I'll send the driver to pick you
up tomorrow

774
01:34:15,665 --> 01:34:19,004
Yes, I'll tell Mr. Mehta

775
01:34:46,534 --> 01:34:49,023
Dad wants you to send him
a copy of the new contract

776
01:34:52,403 --> 01:34:53,732
You are coming to the meeting
tomorrow, aren't you?

777
01:34:55,103 --> 01:34:57,402
Can you give me our transaction
file?

778
01:34:57,673 --> 01:34:59,302
I'd like to know a little more about
them before the meeting

779
01:34:59,643 --> 01:35:01,112
I'll send you the file right away

780
01:35:06,983 --> 01:35:08,452
Is there a good restaurant around
here?

781
01:35:34,742 --> 01:35:36,771
Being alone in a new city
can be so boring

782
01:35:37,552 --> 01:35:38,811
But you aren't alone!

783
01:35:39,512 --> 01:35:40,711
Who said I was bored?

784
01:35:45,222 --> 01:35:47,151
Who'd have thought that
someday you

785
01:35:47,362 --> 01:35:49,221
and me would be sitting
here like friends

786
01:35:51,832 --> 01:35:52,851
Especially after all that happened...

787
01:35:56,002 --> 01:35:56,621
So how is Rohit?

788
01:35:58,172 --> 01:36:00,601
He's fine. I spoke to him
this morning

789
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:05,260
I told him I met you on the flight
and...

790
01:36:08,811 --> 01:36:10,670
And he doesn't like you meeting
me! Right?

791
01:36:16,051 --> 01:36:17,920
But you're here.
Why?

792
01:36:18,121 --> 01:36:20,450
Akash, you don't know Rohit.

793
01:36:20,761 --> 01:36:22,920
He doesn't like me meeting
any boys

794
01:36:25,761 --> 01:36:26,990
But Rohit is a good guy

795
01:36:27,931 --> 01:36:32,800
He has a few faults but then,
don't we all. Me... you...

796
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:35,730
Faults... and me!

797
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:39,699
So tell me about yourself

798
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,139
What do you want to know?

799
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,409
Of course I have. But not for
more than 2 weeks

800
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:54,749
Then there's another girlfriend...
another 2 weeks...

801
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:56,419
And then another...

802
01:36:56,620 --> 01:37:00,559
stop! I understand how your
girlfriend system works

803
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:02,759
What I don't understand is...
why?

804
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:07,529
The fact is, I've seen many of my
friends with their "beloveds"

805
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:10,329
They have everything but love
for each other

806
01:37:11,969 --> 01:37:13,458
That's why I think I am better off
as I am

807
01:37:13,739 --> 01:37:16,708
No questions... no answers

808
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:20,908
I don't ask Rohit questions,
nor do I demand answers

809
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:23,678
But he asks questions.
He demands answers

810
01:37:25,019 --> 01:37:27,348
I never said it's always
the girl's fault

811
01:37:28,059 --> 01:37:31,388
But relationships just get like that.
Start with joy and end in grief

812
01:37:32,459 --> 01:37:36,418
I see! So this is the result of
an end in grief

813
01:37:37,829 --> 01:37:39,598
Now I've understood your
2 weeks formula!

814
01:37:39,799 --> 01:37:40,928
No! It's nothing of the sort

815
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:44,638
I have consciously decided not to
fall in love and ruin my life

816
01:37:46,168 --> 01:37:48,967
But love isn't about decisions.
It just happens

817
01:37:49,678 --> 01:37:50,637
Then I don't let it happen to me

818
01:37:51,848 --> 01:37:54,137
Give it some time. I'm sure
it will some day

819
01:37:56,678 --> 01:37:59,307
Why? Are you proposing?

820
01:38:08,858 --> 01:38:09,987
How was your day?

821
01:38:14,538 --> 01:38:15,327
Akash is nuts

822
01:38:39,127 --> 01:38:40,586
Turn it down guys.
It's my wife-to-be

823
01:38:43,457 --> 01:38:44,086
How are you?

824
01:38:44,797 --> 01:38:46,096
Hopefully a little less drunk

825
01:38:48,967 --> 01:38:50,936
Did you get my message?
Where were you?

826
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:53,096
I met Akash for lunch

827
01:38:57,136 --> 01:39:00,595
I told you not to meet him!
Why don't you listen to me?

828
01:39:03,316 --> 01:39:05,105
Are you yelling at me in front
of your friends?

829
01:39:10,656 --> 01:39:14,115
I am coming there. It'll take some
time but I will be there

830
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:18,125
As you wish, Rohit. Bye

831
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:28,065
Pooja, I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought...

832
01:39:29,935 --> 01:39:32,234
Pooja, if you aren't doing
anything else...

833
01:39:35,115 --> 01:39:37,574
Pooja, I was in the neighbour...

834
01:39:39,445 --> 01:39:40,744
Bye mom, I'll call later

835
01:40:22,324 --> 01:40:23,623
Fine. And you?

836
01:40:26,994 --> 01:40:29,463
Subodh, this is Sameer.
Sameer, this is Subodh

837
01:40:40,673 --> 01:40:41,802
Are you waiting for someone?

838
01:40:42,513 --> 01:40:45,812
Yes. But it seems like
they won't show up now

839
01:40:53,083 --> 01:40:55,212
So tell me... what's the plan
after dinner?

840
01:40:56,263 --> 01:40:56,882
No plan

841
01:40:58,763 --> 01:40:59,882
Come on, let's do something

842
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:02,892
What say, Subodh?

843
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:05,732
I'm sorry. I've made it a habit
to sleep by 10

844
01:41:07,933 --> 01:41:09,732
One night won't change
your habit

845
01:41:10,443 --> 01:41:12,412
Come on, pal. Anyway,
it's Sunday tomorrow

846
01:41:12,772 --> 01:41:15,571
I know. Thing is I've to wake up at
5 and do Yoga

847
01:41:16,282 --> 01:41:19,251
Then some jogging and breakfast
at 8 sharp

848
01:41:20,612 --> 01:41:21,581
And since it's Sunday...

849
01:41:22,122 --> 01:41:23,911
...we spend the day at Kumar uncle's
beach house

850
01:41:27,222 --> 01:41:27,691
I'll be right back

851
01:41:33,932 --> 01:41:35,391
It's time for his bathroom break,
right?

852
01:41:36,102 --> 01:41:38,391
He isn't that bad

853
01:41:42,442 --> 01:41:43,731
So where are you off to?

854
01:41:44,442 --> 01:41:44,901
Let's see...

855
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:49,901
If Time Table doesn't want to
come, may be you can join me

856
01:41:51,111 --> 01:41:52,080
I'm sure I can...

857
01:41:59,451 --> 01:42:00,750
If I call you sometime...

858
01:42:18,701 --> 01:42:21,170
Wow! What're we celebrating?

859
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:22,999
You don't remember?

860
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:28,179
It was on this day five months ago
that I told you what I felt for you

861
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,589
To Subodh and Pooja!

862
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,269
What's the situation like?
- Pretty intense

863
01:42:55,639 --> 01:42:56,268
Really, Mahesh

864
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:01,598
There were such intense scenes
in the film! So moving...

865
01:43:03,149 --> 01:43:04,118
Please cut out the performance

866
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:07,608
And forgive me for taking you
to see such a good film!

867
01:43:08,989 --> 01:43:10,108
You see! That's my biggest problem

868
01:43:10,989 --> 01:43:12,288
I can't bear watching good films

869
01:43:13,659 --> 01:43:17,288
Yes. You only like those
wham bang action films

870
01:43:17,829 --> 01:43:19,298
Anyway, that's all you can
understand...

871
01:43:19,829 --> 01:43:22,628
...because they don't require you
to use your brains or heart!

872
01:43:23,669 --> 01:43:25,468
You need plenty of brains for
these love stories

873
01:43:26,339 --> 01:43:28,968
She sits here shedding tears,
he sits there sighing...

874
01:43:30,178 --> 01:43:31,467
...what's all this lovey- dovey
stuff about anyway!

875
01:43:33,008 --> 01:43:33,807
You won't understand

876
01:43:35,678 --> 01:43:36,807
What're you doing man, let's go

877
01:43:56,538 --> 01:43:59,837
Wonder why
people fall in love

878
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:07,507
Wonder why people
are ready to die for someone

879
01:44:11,717 --> 01:44:15,016
Wonder why
people fall in love

880
01:44:15,557 --> 01:44:18,846
Wonder why people
are ready to die for someone

881
01:44:19,557 --> 01:44:23,516
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why...

882
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:30,686
Wonder why... why... why!

883
01:44:35,407 --> 01:44:39,036
Just think about it,
there is only grief in love

884
01:44:40,406 --> 01:44:44,035
As for love's cruelty,
it's past counting

885
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:49,545
When in love
your head must remain bowed

886
01:44:50,586 --> 01:44:54,715
Even when in pain
you have to smile

887
01:44:54,926 --> 01:44:58,055
Why fill your own life
with poison?

888
01:45:02,436 --> 01:45:05,725
Wonder why
people fall in love

889
01:45:07,766 --> 01:45:11,225
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why

890
01:45:12,776 --> 01:45:16,405
Wonder why why... why...

891
01:45:21,445 --> 01:45:27,584
Without love
what's left in life

892
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:35,754
Without love
A person is Ionely

893
01:45:40,305 --> 01:45:43,604
Without love
what's there in life

894
01:45:44,135 --> 01:45:47,264
Without love
A person is Ionely

895
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:51,103
Love brings colour
into your life

896
01:45:51,644 --> 01:45:54,943
Love brings beauty
into your life

897
01:45:55,484 --> 01:45:58,783
People fall in love
but hide it

898
01:46:02,994 --> 01:46:06,283
Wonder why they fear
expressing it openly

899
01:46:08,324 --> 01:46:11,783
Wonder why,
Oh wonder why...

900
01:46:13,164 --> 01:46:16,793
Wonder why why why!

901
01:47:04,712 --> 01:47:07,341
Love is just
needless trouble

902
01:47:09,552 --> 01:47:12,521
Love is beautiful
in every aspect

903
01:47:14,062 --> 01:47:17,511
We are all better off
far away from love

904
01:47:19,402 --> 01:47:22,521
Love's every form
is the assured truth

905
01:47:22,902 --> 01:47:27,201
He that tests love's
waters...

906
01:47:27,902 --> 01:47:31,031
...neither drowns nor floats

907
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:34,040
Wonder why?

908
01:47:34,241 --> 01:47:37,370
Everyone but everyone
falls in love

909
01:47:37,751 --> 01:47:41,550
Wonder why only you
keep avoiding it

910
01:47:41,751 --> 01:47:45,550
Wonder why...

911
01:47:45,761 --> 01:47:47,880
Wonder why...

912
01:47:49,431 --> 01:47:53,380
Wonder why why why!

913
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:28,129
Tell me something Shalini

914
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:30,629
Why're you so scared of
sitting on these rides?

915
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:32,299
I m not scared

916
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:38,299
I think only those who aren't right
in their heads enjoy these rides

917
01:48:41,009 --> 01:48:41,638
Interesting excuse

918
01:48:42,509 --> 01:48:44,638
You need courage to sit on
these rides! You need guts

919
01:48:45,849 --> 01:48:48,148
But don't worry. There are many
cowards like you around here

920
01:48:49,349 --> 01:48:50,648
Look. There's one right there

921
01:48:55,519 --> 01:48:56,488
It's not like that at all

922
01:48:57,189 --> 01:49:01,318
If it isn't like that, then get on
that ride with me

923
01:49:06,369 --> 01:49:07,498
Why? No guts?

924
01:49:09,539 --> 01:49:10,158
It's getting late

925
01:49:16,048 --> 01:49:17,507
I'm going on that ride

926
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:21,517
If you want, you can come with me.
Or sit here and get bored

927
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:30,587
Absolutely no guts

928
01:50:29,746 --> 01:50:31,715
Hurry. We can catch this train

929
01:52:51,392 --> 01:52:53,511
Really Shalini! How could you
scare that poor old man!

930
01:53:08,772 --> 01:53:09,901
How did it go?

931
01:53:10,772 --> 01:53:13,401
Really well. They like my work

932
01:53:13,782 --> 01:53:17,231
And... they want me to
come back

933
01:53:18,281 --> 01:53:19,250
That's great

934
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:21,080
When will you have to go?

935
01:53:21,781 --> 01:53:24,080
I've just returned and you're
asking about my leaving

936
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:28,250
Did you talk to Sameer?

937
01:53:28,621 --> 01:53:29,250
No. Why?

938
01:53:29,961 --> 01:53:32,930
He came over the morning
you left

939
01:53:33,291 --> 01:53:34,590
He seemed very troubled

940
01:53:36,631 --> 01:53:39,600
What did he say?
- Nothing

941
01:53:49,141 --> 01:53:51,610
When did you get back?

942
01:53:55,150 --> 01:53:56,779
How are you? How's everything?

943
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:58,449
Great. How are things with you
man?

944
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:00,449
It's a very long story

945
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:01,949
Let's go up and talk

946
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:09,259
Okay, so here's the situation

947
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:12,759
You are pretty good friends.
Hang out together

948
01:54:13,470 --> 01:54:14,929
But you still haven't told her
how you feel

949
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:17,759
I've tried very hard...

950
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:22,439
But the words just don't come out

951
01:54:26,649 --> 01:54:27,768
Didn't she have a boyfriend?

952
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:31,438
Yup. She did... but not anymore

953
01:54:32,649 --> 01:54:34,448
I don't know what Pooja saw
in him

954
01:54:34,989 --> 01:54:37,458
I mean he was sweet
but what a bore!

955
01:54:39,989 --> 01:54:42,958
One day I made the mistake of
going for a drive with them

956
01:54:45,029 --> 01:54:45,998
See this place...

957
01:54:46,699 --> 01:54:49,328
I met Pooja for the first time
on 15th September right here

958
01:54:52,539 --> 01:54:55,998
Exactly 7 days later, we came here
to have ice cream... 22nd September

959
01:54:59,709 --> 01:55:01,008
You wouldn't remember the time,
would you?

960
01:55:01,548 --> 01:55:04,846
Of course I remember.
It was exactly 5.55

961
01:55:11,722 --> 01:55:14,010
That's not all

962
01:55:14,891 --> 01:55:18,009
He'd buy her a balloon
everyday

963
01:55:18,389 --> 01:55:19,008
Balloon...?

964
01:55:20,058 --> 01:55:24,515
Yes. You know those heart shaped
ones you get at signals

965
01:55:28,064 --> 01:55:30,522
It's okay but...
Everyday!

966
01:55:30,893 --> 01:55:31,692
One balloon a day!

967
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,169
I knew the guy was deranged

968
01:55:49,374 --> 01:55:53,002
If you love Pooja so much,
why haven't you told her?

969
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,169
I was afraid...

970
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:02,007
What if Pooja says no?

971
01:56:03,876 --> 01:56:07,004
I'd even lose this friendship
we share now...

972
01:56:07,884 --> 01:56:08,843
and be all alone

973
01:56:13,881 --> 01:56:16,679
You weren't here.
Nor was Akash

974
01:56:23,217 --> 01:56:24,186
Anyway, you're here now

975
01:56:25,056 --> 01:56:27,025
And I feel stronger knowing
that you're here for me

976
01:56:28,394 --> 01:56:29,683
I'm always here for you, Sameer

977
01:56:33,722 --> 01:56:34,521
Then... shall I tell her today?

978
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:38,019
Tell her

979
01:56:41,728 --> 01:56:43,856
Pooja, there's something
I need to tell you

980
01:56:46,895 --> 01:56:51,522
I wonder what if the arranging
incident hadn't happened

981
01:56:54,241 --> 01:56:57,029
If we hadn't met the way we
did...

982
01:56:57,909 --> 01:57:01,197
If I had met you somewhere else,
would we be the same as we are now?

983
01:57:01,907 --> 01:57:04,875
And if we weren't the way we are,
how else would we be?

984
01:57:05,246 --> 01:57:06,705
If you thought differently
about me...

985
01:57:06,905 --> 01:57:09,033
...if I thought differently about
you, what'd happen?

986
01:57:11,143 --> 01:57:14,771
What's happening now?
...What am I saying?

987
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:21,947
Just a lot of ifs!
What's the matter?

988
01:57:24,986 --> 01:57:26,115
The matter is just that...

989
01:57:28,324 --> 01:57:29,443
I'm falling in love with you

990
01:57:32,162 --> 01:57:34,450
I agree that we don't know
each other very well

991
01:57:41,498 --> 01:57:45,625
If you trust me at all, believe
that I am telling the truth

992
01:58:29,284 --> 01:58:34,241
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

993
01:58:34,451 --> 01:58:39,758
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

994
01:58:44,626 --> 01:58:46,924
She who loves only me

995
01:58:47,125 --> 01:58:49,423
She must be even ready
to say...

996
01:58:49,634 --> 01:58:51,922
"O listen, you are the one
who has my heart"

997
01:58:52,132 --> 01:58:54,930
Oh, where is that girl?

998
01:59:04,636 --> 01:59:09,593
She who lives in your dream
as love's beautiful embodiment...

999
01:59:09,804 --> 01:59:12,102
You will find her someday
or other

1000
01:59:12,312 --> 01:59:15,270
Just look here and there

1001
01:59:19,978 --> 01:59:22,276
Let's both go and find her...

1002
01:59:22,477 --> 01:59:24,775
This angel, this fairy,
this damsel so dainty...

1003
01:59:24,986 --> 01:59:27,274
...who upon seeing,
you will say

1004
01:59:27,485 --> 01:59:30,283
She is right here!

1005
02:00:05,666 --> 02:00:09,294
I wonder why
I had this thought...

1006
02:00:10,003 --> 02:00:15,630
Could you be the
dream girl?

1007
02:00:15,841 --> 02:00:25,306
You have all the graces
that I search for everywhere

1008
02:00:25,516 --> 02:00:27,974
I think you are deluded

1009
02:00:28,174 --> 02:00:30,472
I wonder what you think I am

1010
02:00:30,683 --> 02:00:32,981
I am no angel or fairy
nor any celestial nymph

1011
02:00:33,182 --> 02:00:36,150
Don't have any such
illusions

1012
02:00:40,848 --> 02:00:45,655
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

1013
02:00:45,856 --> 02:00:51,153
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

1014
02:01:26,545 --> 02:01:30,503
Suppose I say to you...

1015
02:01:30,713 --> 02:01:36,510
All I think of
is you and only you

1016
02:01:36,710 --> 02:01:40,668
You must know
this is what I desire...

1017
02:01:40,878 --> 02:01:46,345
...you must be with me,
only with me

1018
02:01:46,555 --> 02:01:48,843
Oh, what have you made me believe!

1019
02:01:49,054 --> 02:01:51,352
Oh, how you make my heart beat!

1020
02:01:51,553 --> 02:01:53,851
You melt my body and soul...

1021
02:01:54,051 --> 02:01:56,849
...reciting this saga of yours

1022
02:02:06,725 --> 02:02:11,522
I look everywhere for her.
But I still haven't found her

1023
02:02:11,733 --> 02:02:14,531
Where is the girl
in whose love I can believe?

1024
02:02:14,731 --> 02:02:19,188
Oh, where is that girl?
That girl is here!

1025
02:02:19,399 --> 02:02:35,371
Where is that girl?
- That girl is here!

1026
02:03:03,087 --> 02:03:06,055
I can't believe that it's already
time for you to leave

1027
02:03:08,095 --> 02:03:10,064
Don't worry, Mom.
I'll be back soon

1028
02:03:10,593 --> 02:03:12,062
Three months is not soon

1029
02:03:13,592 --> 02:03:14,721
And that's this time

1030
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:18,559
You don't know how long
you'll be gone next time

1031
02:03:21,598 --> 02:03:25,895
Siddharth... have you thought about
marriage?

1032
02:03:26,106 --> 02:03:26,725
Mom!

1033
02:03:28,604 --> 02:03:29,573
What Mom!

1034
02:03:32,103 --> 02:03:35,401
Some other time, okay?
- But why? Why not now?

1035
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:43,906
It's just... forget it, Mom.
You won't understand

1036
02:03:46,615 --> 02:03:49,733
I'm your mother! If I can't
understand you, who else will?

1037
02:03:52,782 --> 02:03:53,901
Is there someone you like?

1038
02:03:59,289 --> 02:04:01,248
Sid, what's the matter?

1039
02:04:02,287 --> 02:04:03,916
You've never hidden anything
from me

1040
02:04:04,117 --> 02:04:06,585
Yes, Ma. But there are some things
that you just can't tell somebody

1041
02:04:06,955 --> 02:04:08,084
Yes there are...

1042
02:04:08,794 --> 02:04:12,082
But I can see there's something
eating away at you inside

1043
02:04:12,462 --> 02:04:14,580
Will you keep it bottled up inside
all your life?

1044
02:04:21,958 --> 02:04:23,587
Ma, I'm telling you
you won't understand!

1045
02:04:24,466 --> 02:04:25,585
Why won't I understand?

1046
02:04:26,965 --> 02:04:28,434
Try telling me

1047
02:04:32,133 --> 02:04:34,761
What is this thing that I don't
have the right to know?

1048
02:04:39,139 --> 02:04:39,758
What's the matter?

1049
02:04:52,143 --> 02:04:53,112
That Tara Jaiswal?

1050
02:04:55,881 --> 02:04:58,009
I've met her so many times...
But... she...

1051
02:05:00,718 --> 02:05:01,837
When did this start?

1052
02:05:03,047 --> 02:05:04,516
I don't know when...

1053
02:05:06,555 --> 02:05:08,174
I won't let you ruin your life!

1054
02:05:09,054 --> 02:05:11,182
Have you any inkling of what
you are saying?

1055
02:05:12,392 --> 02:05:14,351
My son has fallen in love with
a woman who...

1056
02:05:15,051 --> 02:05:16,680
You were right I wouldn't
understand

1057
02:05:18,219 --> 02:05:20,847
And what has she told you,
that she loves you?

1058
02:05:21,228 --> 02:05:23,856
She must've seduced you with her
sad stories

1059
02:05:24,496 --> 02:05:25,615
What did she say to you?
- She said nothing!

1060
02:05:32,163 --> 02:05:33,132
She doesn't even know that I...

1061
02:05:42,507 --> 02:05:44,296
Your mother is absolutely right,
Siddharth

1062
02:05:45,336 --> 02:05:50,293
Don't ruin your life over me. And the
little peace I have left in my life...

1063
02:05:51,173 --> 02:05:53,301
Please don't take it away
from me

1064
02:06:13,422 --> 02:06:16,390
Go away! - Please listen to me

1065
02:06:16,590 --> 02:06:17,559
I don't want to hear anything

1066
02:06:18,589 --> 02:06:21,887
Have I ever made you feel
that I love you...

1067
02:06:22,088 --> 02:06:23,717
...or want a relationship
with you?

1068
02:06:25,426 --> 02:06:25,895
No

1069
02:06:26,595 --> 02:06:28,064
Then what made you think...

1070
02:06:28,594 --> 02:06:29,723
...that you and I could...

1071
02:06:30,264 --> 02:06:31,563
...have any such relationship?

1072
02:06:35,431 --> 02:06:37,060
This is the problem with your
generation

1073
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:43,227
You all think anything goes.
But that's not so, Siddharth

1074
02:06:46,435 --> 02:06:48,234
Why just me?

1075
02:06:49,104 --> 02:06:50,403
You have also caused your mother
a lot of pain

1076
02:06:52,942 --> 02:06:53,731
Please sit down

1077
02:07:23,957 --> 02:07:27,255
I'm so sorry that I caused you
and my mother such pain

1078
02:07:31,293 --> 02:07:33,591
I'm sorry you had to hear
all this because of me

1079
02:07:37,130 --> 02:07:39,099
But it's true that I love you

1080
02:07:52,932 --> 02:07:56,230
It's also true that I never
wanted you to know it

1081
02:07:58,409 --> 02:07:59,868
Because I knew that you...

1082
02:08:01,908 --> 02:08:02,707
...would never be able to understand

1083
02:08:08,145 --> 02:08:09,614
I just want to see you happy

1084
02:08:14,481 --> 02:08:19,438
And if knowing the truth
has caused you pain today...

1085
02:08:22,148 --> 02:08:25,446
All I can say is, that wasn't
my intention

1086
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:40,948
Sid, please leave now

1087
02:09:15,441 --> 02:09:16,240
After the workshop...

1088
02:09:18,949 --> 02:09:21,417
I think I'll go stay at uncle's
farm house for a while

1089
02:09:23,617 --> 02:09:25,086
It's a good place to paint

1090
02:09:35,451 --> 02:09:36,580
Will you come with me?

1091
02:09:40,628 --> 02:09:42,087
I don't want to go without you

1092
02:10:20,648 --> 02:10:21,267
Just a minute...

1093
02:11:17,710 --> 02:11:18,669
You look very lovely

1094
02:11:24,377 --> 02:11:26,675
So, why are we here?

1095
02:11:28,045 --> 02:11:31,843
To prove to you that a thing called
love does exist in this world

1096
02:11:35,051 --> 02:11:36,340
Don't you ever give up?

1097
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:39,179
Shut up and lets go in

1098
02:12:07,235 --> 02:12:09,523
Why are we here?
- To watch an opera

1099
02:12:10,903 --> 02:12:11,692
Yes, but why?

1100
02:12:13,062 --> 02:12:14,531
You'll know when the time comes

1101
02:13:21,938 --> 02:13:24,226
The girl's name is Cressida
and the boy is Troilus

1102
02:13:25,766 --> 02:13:27,565
They love each other very much

1103
02:13:46,785 --> 02:13:48,244
But Troilus must go now

1104
02:13:49,614 --> 02:13:51,583
He has to go to war for his country

1105
02:13:53,452 --> 02:13:55,920
Cressida is afraid something may
happen to him

1106
02:13:58,120 --> 02:14:00,248
Troilus is telling her
nothing will happen to him

1107
02:15:21,498 --> 02:15:27,125
This is the spirit of Troilus...
standing at heaven's gate

1108
02:15:28,834 --> 02:15:30,303
But he doesn't want to go inside

1109
02:15:33,002 --> 02:15:34,801
He is asking God for one day

1110
02:15:37,340 --> 02:15:39,129
He wants to meet Cressida for
one last time

1111
02:15:41,178 --> 02:15:44,466
And tell her how much he loves her

1112
02:15:47,845 --> 02:15:49,474
If he is given one day...

1113
02:15:51,013 --> 02:15:53,141
He is willing to die a thousand
deaths

1114
02:16:01,188 --> 02:16:02,807
Shut your eyes, Akash

1115
02:16:08,854 --> 02:16:09,323
Think...

1116
02:16:10,853 --> 02:16:11,322
Who is it...

1117
02:16:13,022 --> 02:16:16,480
...to spend that one day with, you
are willing to die a thousand deaths

1118
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:20,158
Who is it, Akash?

1119
02:17:57,510 --> 02:17:58,809
No so easily!

1120
02:18:00,339 --> 02:18:02,637
You still haven't told me
who you saw

1121
02:18:05,346 --> 02:18:06,815
You seem quite sure that I
saw someone?

1122
02:18:07,515 --> 02:18:09,314
Yes. Because today for
the first time...

1123
02:18:09,514 --> 02:18:11,812
...you're talking less
and thinking more!

1124
02:18:23,757 --> 02:18:24,376
Then listen

1125
02:18:26,756 --> 02:18:27,385
I saw her...

1126
02:18:29,754 --> 02:18:30,383
And I felt...

1127
02:18:30,594 --> 02:18:33,222
...perhaps this is what
they call love

1128
02:18:40,759 --> 02:18:41,888
I wanted to touch her...

1129
02:18:44,267 --> 02:18:45,566
...hold her in my arms...

1130
02:18:48,765 --> 02:18:51,563
I saw such innocence
in her eyes...

1131
02:18:54,432 --> 02:18:55,561
...like I see in your eyes now

1132
02:19:00,269 --> 02:19:01,398
Her voice...

1133
02:19:01,778 --> 02:19:03,397
...had the kind of magic
your voice has

1134
02:19:05,606 --> 02:19:09,404
I can still feel the fragrance
of her breath...

1135
02:19:09,614 --> 02:19:11,073
...like I can feel
in your breath now

1136
02:19:13,242 --> 02:19:14,041
Who was she?

1137
02:19:25,456 --> 02:19:26,575
That fat opera singer!

1138
02:19:44,627 --> 02:19:50,923
Shalini, come inside... at once!

1139
02:20:45,496 --> 02:20:47,115
I think the two of you should
talk alone

1140
02:20:56,601 --> 02:20:59,069
Where had you gone?
- To the opera

1141
02:21:01,328 --> 02:21:02,127
With Akash!

1142
02:21:03,997 --> 02:21:06,295
How many times have I told you
not to meet him!

1143
02:21:09,674 --> 02:21:12,972
Rohit, will you keep telling me
all my life...

1144
02:21:13,172 --> 02:21:14,641
...who I should or should not meet!

1145
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:18,629
Yes. I will

1146
02:21:19,339 --> 02:21:22,637
And you will never see Akash
again. You got that?

1147
02:21:29,184 --> 02:21:32,302
Rohit, I need some time to think
and you need it too

1148
02:22:52,863 --> 02:22:56,151
Shalini had called.
She said it's important

1149
02:23:08,535 --> 02:23:10,334
Hi, Rohit. It's Akash

1150
02:23:11,863 --> 02:23:14,161
Is Shalini there? She had called

1151
02:23:14,702 --> 02:23:18,500
I know. We are going back...
to get married

1152
02:23:24,207 --> 02:23:25,176
Can I speak to Shalini?

1153
02:23:53,123 --> 02:23:54,592
That's good news

1154
02:23:57,220 --> 02:23:58,849
Akash, we are going back tomorrow

1155
02:24:00,229 --> 02:24:01,688
Can you come for dinner tonight?

1156
02:24:04,727 --> 02:24:06,855
I don't know. Bye

1157
02:24:24,237 --> 02:24:25,366
Hey, Akash! We thought you
weren't going to make it

1158
02:25:08,025 --> 02:25:10,393
They're beautiful. Thanks

1159
02:25:12,093 --> 02:25:12,782
What will you drink?

1160
02:25:14,532 --> 02:25:17,790
We can drink later. Let's eat first.
I'm starving

1161
02:25:44,777 --> 02:25:47,575
Shalini, have you told
Mahesh Uncle...

1162
02:25:47,775 --> 02:25:49,244
...how you and Akash met?

1163
02:25:53,282 --> 02:25:53,801
No?

1164
02:25:56,581 --> 02:25:57,740
Really, Mahesh Uncle...

1165
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:00,578
I don't know what you'd have
done if you were there

1166
02:26:00,789 --> 02:26:01,908
What happened?

1167
02:26:03,717 --> 02:26:05,416
It was at my graduation
party

1168
02:26:06,086 --> 02:26:06,745
Shalini was with me

1169
02:26:06,956 --> 02:26:09,014
Perhaps Akash didn't know
that...

1170
02:26:19,289 --> 02:26:20,588
Sorry for the punch

1171
02:26:23,967 --> 02:26:26,425
No, Rohit. It was my fault

1172
02:26:29,464 --> 02:26:32,432
But to tell you the truth,
I think I was lucky

1173
02:26:33,772 --> 02:26:34,251
What do you mean?

1174
02:26:34,602 --> 02:26:38,160
I mean, if Shalini was with me...

1175
02:26:39,140 --> 02:26:41,268
...and someone had acted fresh...

1176
02:26:42,978 --> 02:26:44,267
I'd have killed him

1177
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:58,269
That is...

1178
02:26:59,619 --> 02:27:01,108
If Shalini was with you

1179
02:27:34,002 --> 02:27:34,591
Hey, wait...

1180
02:27:55,571 --> 02:27:58,129
You're coming to our wedding,
aren't you?

1181
02:27:59,180 --> 02:28:01,978
No, I can't make it. There's a lot
of work to be done

1182
02:28:04,317 --> 02:28:05,306
Some friend you are!

1183
02:28:06,916 --> 02:28:09,474
Anyway, don't forget to call us to
your wedding

1184
02:28:10,314 --> 02:28:11,143
We'll definitely be there

1185
02:28:12,053 --> 02:28:13,812
I'm not going to get married

1186
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:15,141
Why?

1187
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:20,648
It's necessary to love someone
to get married

1188
02:28:21,518 --> 02:28:22,987
And I believe...

1189
02:28:23,357 --> 02:28:25,156
...this thing called love doesn't
exist in the world

1190
02:28:27,755 --> 02:28:29,454
Shalini and I love each other

1191
02:28:29,694 --> 02:28:31,493
That's why we're getting married.
Isn't that so, Shalini?

1192
02:28:34,862 --> 02:28:39,489
You both shouldn't ask each other
this question. Ask yourself

1193
02:28:45,536 --> 02:28:46,325
I better go

1194
02:29:19,819 --> 02:29:22,007
You left your jacket with me
the other night

1195
02:29:35,891 --> 02:29:40,848
Some day I want to tell you why
I am marrying Rohit

1196
02:29:41,059 --> 02:29:45,017
Why? What's the need to tell me?

1197
02:29:47,695 --> 02:29:48,524
I need to...

1198
02:29:49,864 --> 02:29:51,523
Because we both know...

1199
02:29:54,632 --> 02:29:56,531
...that night at the opera,
when you shut your eyes...

1200
02:29:57,870 --> 02:30:00,358
...it wasn't the fat opera singer
you saw

1201
02:30:26,756 --> 02:30:33,382
Loneliness

1202
02:30:36,521 --> 02:30:40,888
This Ioneliness...

1203
02:30:46,366 --> 02:30:51,063
Why have I stumbled on
the path of love

1204
02:30:51,364 --> 02:30:55,891
All my dreams lie shattered
A sense of gloom lies heavy

1205
02:30:56,101 --> 02:31:00,558
Every joy is be numbed

1206
02:31:00,939 --> 02:31:05,996
My very life is lost

1207
02:31:06,276 --> 02:31:10,973
I am being punished
for loving you

1208
02:31:11,174 --> 02:31:16,041
Loneliness...

1209
02:31:16,481 --> 02:31:20,778
Loneliness stretches over
miles and miles

1210
02:32:10,304 --> 02:32:15,761
In my dream I saw
a hand in my hand

1211
02:32:20,309 --> 02:32:25,936
Now I am blinded by the
shards of a shattered dream

1212
02:32:40,149 --> 02:32:44,606
Someone was here yesterday

1213
02:32:44,827 --> 02:32:49,914
but today there is no one

1214
02:32:50,324 --> 02:32:55,121
Like a cobra's venomous hiss
it envelopes my very breath...

1215
02:32:55,332 --> 02:32:59,989
...this Ioneliness

1216
02:33:00,369 --> 02:33:04,556
has brought tears to my eyes

1217
02:33:54,522 --> 02:33:59,979
Oh how could my hope for
something be so futile

1218
02:34:04,457 --> 02:34:10,264
I've embarked on a journey
to which there is no destination

1219
02:34:24,037 --> 02:34:28,334
Where should I go?

1220
02:34:28,705 --> 02:34:33,802
To whom shall I explain?

1221
02:34:34,242 --> 02:34:36,330
What I had wanted...

1222
02:34:36,541 --> 02:34:38,839
And why I ended up with...

1223
02:34:39,050 --> 02:34:44,007
...this Ioneliness

1224
02:34:44,217 --> 02:34:48,344
Loneliness
deeply dark as the night

1225
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:03,687
Why have I stumbled on
the path of love

1226
02:35:03,887 --> 02:35:08,324
All my dreams lie shattered
A sense of gloom lies heavy

1227
02:35:08,525 --> 02:35:13,192
Every joy is be numbed

1228
02:35:13,393 --> 02:35:18,700
My very life is lost

1229
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:23,527
I am being punished
for loving you

1230
02:35:23,737 --> 02:35:28,394
Loneliness...

1231
02:35:28,905 --> 02:35:33,202
Loneliness stretches over
miles and miles

1232
02:36:20,429 --> 02:36:21,658
Hello, Aunty. Is Sameer home?

1233
02:36:21,998 --> 02:36:22,727
Who is this?

1234
02:36:26,636 --> 02:36:29,564
You want to talk to Sameer
and you've called Siddharth!

1235
02:36:30,634 --> 02:36:31,393
How are you?

1236
02:36:32,073 --> 02:36:33,902
I... I'm okay, Aunty

1237
02:36:34,502 --> 02:36:38,400
He's gone to Kasauli. Give me
your number. I'll give it to him

1238
02:36:40,069 --> 02:36:42,068
No, it's okay.
I'll call him

1239
02:37:36,101 --> 02:37:36,860
How are you, son?

1240
02:37:40,899 --> 02:37:41,558
I'm okay, Dad

1241
02:37:44,037 --> 02:37:47,335
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

1242
02:37:48,675 --> 02:37:49,694
No, it's nothing like that

1243
02:37:51,114 --> 02:37:52,443
Been working all day...

1244
02:37:52,813 --> 02:37:53,602
I'm tired, that's all

1245
02:38:05,916 --> 02:38:07,545
Come back home, Akash

1246
02:38:36,361 --> 02:38:37,300
What's wrong, Akash?

1247
02:38:39,570 --> 02:38:41,469
I've never seen you like this
before

1248
02:38:42,668 --> 02:38:43,727
I'm in love, Dad

1249
02:38:46,906 --> 02:38:49,594
So what's the problem?

1250
02:38:51,134 --> 02:38:52,623
She is marrying somebody else

1251
02:38:56,841 --> 02:38:59,309
Have you told her you love her?

1252
02:39:01,449 --> 02:39:01,928
No

1253
02:39:03,448 --> 02:39:04,877
Does she love you?

1254
02:39:09,315 --> 02:39:10,074
Yes, she does

1255
02:39:12,823 --> 02:39:13,942
Has she told you?

1256
02:39:20,159 --> 02:39:24,646
Akash, you must tell her
how you feel

1257
02:39:27,296 --> 02:39:27,755
No

1258
02:39:28,565 --> 02:39:29,154
Why not?

1259
02:39:32,563 --> 02:39:33,992
She is marrying somebody else

1260
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:42,327
There are many things in this world
that are beyond our understanding

1261
02:39:43,498 --> 02:39:45,327
When a person decides something...

1262
02:39:46,536 --> 02:39:49,664
...there must be a reason for that
decision

1263
02:39:50,804 --> 02:39:56,031
You say that the girl loves you
but is marrying someone else

1264
02:39:57,371 --> 02:40:01,668
Have you tried to find out
why she's doing it?

1265
02:40:04,147 --> 02:40:06,235
What's the reason for her decision?

1266
02:40:25,417 --> 02:40:26,356
How's Shalini?

1267
02:40:28,185 --> 02:40:28,914
She isn't happy

1268
02:40:31,054 --> 02:40:32,023
And how could she be?

1269
02:40:33,193 --> 02:40:36,161
She is marrying Rohit
but loves you

1270
02:40:40,329 --> 02:40:41,988
Did she tell you that?
- No

1271
02:40:44,327 --> 02:40:46,056
Did you ever tell me you love her?

1272
02:40:51,534 --> 02:40:53,293
Then why's she getting married?

1273
02:40:56,101 --> 02:40:58,589
Rohit's father and Shalini's father
were business partners

1274
02:41:00,909 --> 02:41:05,836
Shalini was six when her parents
were killed in a car accident

1275
02:41:07,546 --> 02:41:12,443
I was her only relative but
I wasn't able to support her

1276
02:41:15,542 --> 02:41:16,771
Rohit's parents took her in...

1277
02:41:16,981 --> 02:41:17,540
...not only into their home

1278
02:41:17,751 --> 02:41:19,680
but their hearts and their life

1279
02:41:20,949 --> 02:41:22,438
They've done a lot for her

1280
02:41:23,548 --> 02:41:27,546
If they want her to marry Rohit,
Shalini can't refuse

1281
02:41:30,084 --> 02:41:31,313
What else can she do?

1282
02:41:33,093 --> 02:41:36,651
On one hand are the people who've
given her the life she's living

1283
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:39,089
On the other hand is a man...

1284
02:41:39,290 --> 02:41:41,988
She doesn't even know if he loves
her or not

1285
02:41:43,158 --> 02:41:47,825
Akash, what are you doing man!
Go and tell her you love her

1286
02:41:51,494 --> 02:41:53,463
Akash, only you know what
you have to do

1287
02:41:54,962 --> 02:41:57,090
Just know this. Tonight is
the Sangeet function...

1288
02:41:58,430 --> 02:41:59,629
...and tomorrow the wedding

1289
02:42:01,909 --> 02:42:04,767
Whatever your decision,
you must make it today

1290
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,659
Will you marry me?

1291
02:44:30,145 --> 02:44:32,773
Not even if I tell you that
I love you?

1292
02:45:14,163 --> 02:45:14,722
Shalini...

1293
02:45:16,731 --> 02:45:18,789
I love you and only you

1294
02:45:21,339 --> 02:45:22,358
My every breath...

1295
02:45:24,038 --> 02:45:25,127
...every heartbeat...

1296
02:45:26,906 --> 02:45:29,494
...every moment,
is for you, Shalini

1297
02:45:32,343 --> 02:45:37,500
I'm sure that I was born
so that I could love you

1298
02:45:39,010 --> 02:45:41,638
And you were born to become mine

1299
02:45:42,948 --> 02:45:44,307
You are mine, Shalini

1300
02:45:45,377 --> 02:45:47,146
And if you ask your heart...

1301
02:45:48,285 --> 02:45:51,373
...you will know that I speak
the truth

1302
02:45:58,350 --> 02:46:00,978
What's going on! Who is this boy?

1303
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:02,148
I'll tell you

1304
02:46:03,358 --> 02:46:07,056
He is Akash Malhotra,
A.K. Malhotra's son...

1305
02:46:07,726 --> 02:46:09,984
...who's been after Shalini,
wagging his tail

1306
02:46:10,964 --> 02:46:14,652
I hit him once but I guess
it wasn't enough, huh?

1307
02:46:15,732 --> 02:46:16,851
I won't leave you today!

1308
02:46:17,061 --> 02:46:22,298
You will do no such thing, Rohit.
I want to speak to Shalini first

1309
02:46:51,584 --> 02:46:54,342
No, Rohit! You wait here.
- But Dad! This is my life...

1310
02:48:13,093 --> 02:48:16,751
Mahesh, I feel very hurt today

1311
02:48:17,931 --> 02:48:20,619
I always thought that Shalini was
my daughter

1312
02:48:21,529 --> 02:48:24,557
But today I feel that she has
never thought of us as her own

1313
02:48:26,796 --> 02:48:29,694
She wants to repay her debt to us
by marrying Rohit

1314
02:48:32,234 --> 02:48:32,723
All right

1315
02:48:36,102 --> 02:48:39,130
Shalini, you must repay us

1316
02:48:40,869 --> 02:48:44,567
For looking after you from
childhood till now... you owe us

1317
02:48:45,407 --> 02:48:48,235
For giving you whatever you
asked for... you owe us

1318
02:48:49,505 --> 02:48:52,443
For shielding you from
even a hint of trouble...

1319
02:48:52,543 --> 02:48:53,372
...you owe us

1320
02:48:55,442 --> 02:48:59,609
Now if you want to repay all that
you owe us... see us happy...

1321
02:49:02,578 --> 02:49:04,107
Then marry Akash

1322
02:49:10,924 --> 02:49:12,443
Can you do this much for me?

1323
02:49:32,593 --> 02:49:33,222
Come...

1324
02:49:44,567 --> 02:49:48,664
Take care of her.
She is my daughter

1325
02:50:24,188 --> 02:50:24,947
Just a minute, Dad

1326
02:50:27,326 --> 02:50:30,084
You can't do this! Mom, why
aren't you saying anything?

1327
02:50:30,724 --> 02:50:32,623
Let her go, Rohit

1328
02:50:35,932 --> 02:50:39,120
You care about Shalini's happiness
but don't give a damn about mine!

1329
02:50:39,430 --> 02:50:43,887
Rohit, if Shalini is not happy
being with you...

1330
02:50:44,537 --> 02:50:46,026
...how can you ever be happy?

1331
02:50:48,166 --> 02:50:49,325
This can't happen to me!

1332
02:50:53,073 --> 02:50:54,232
I won't allow this!

1333
02:50:57,641 --> 02:50:58,130
What are you doing?

1334
02:51:33,493 --> 02:51:35,112
I love Akash

1335
02:51:56,172 --> 02:51:57,401
All his life he said...

1336
02:51:57,701 --> 02:51:59,400
I won't say "I love you" to anyone

1337
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:00,829
And when he had to say it...

1338
02:52:01,169 --> 02:52:04,037
It was at someone's wedding
in front of 300 people!

1339
02:52:08,346 --> 02:52:09,395
Did you call him?

1340
02:52:13,213 --> 02:52:14,042
What did he say?

1341
02:52:17,081 --> 02:52:18,070
He wasn't home

1342
02:52:23,748 --> 02:52:25,477
I told you he won't come

1343
02:54:18,810 --> 02:54:20,799
Can I talk to Sid?

1344
02:54:42,649 --> 02:54:43,421
How are you?

1345
02:54:45,227 --> 02:54:47,032
Fine. How are you?

1346
02:54:53,764 --> 02:54:54,927
Forgive me

1347
02:54:57,886 --> 02:54:59,410
I must apologise too

1348
02:55:00,655 --> 02:55:04,507
Some other time.
It's my turn today

1349
02:55:06,985 --> 02:55:08,248
You haven't changed
at all

1350
02:55:09,092 --> 02:55:13,044
Ya. Anyway, it's hard to improve
on perfection

1351
02:55:19,374 --> 02:55:20,738
Where are you? When can we meet?

1352
02:55:22,213 --> 02:55:25,824
Today. Now. This very moment

1353
02:57:04,475 --> 02:57:08,618
Now... there's no pain...
nor any fear

1354
02:57:13,112 --> 02:57:14,606
I feel good

1355
02:57:17,025 --> 02:57:18,018
It's peaceful here

1356
02:57:22,652 --> 02:57:24,788
You're a good boy, Siddharth

1357
02:57:28,842 --> 02:57:30,547
You always stood by me

1358
02:57:35,232 --> 02:57:36,897
You want me to be happy,
don't you...

1359
02:57:40,830 --> 02:57:41,993
Then... you be happy

1360
02:57:44,842 --> 02:57:45,604
You will, won't you?

1361
02:57:45,986 --> 02:57:46,537
I will

1362
02:57:57,532 --> 02:57:58,966
Life is so strange

1363
02:58:01,214 --> 02:58:02,618
Some relationships...

1364
02:58:05,828 --> 02:58:07,463
...don't have any name

1365
02:58:14,295 --> 02:58:16,331
You and I will always...

1366
03:00:13,561 --> 03:00:16,259
Hey Sid, look at your ship

1367
03:00:17,272 --> 03:00:19,769
It was so small 2 years ago.
Look how much it's grown

1368
03:00:23,071 --> 03:00:26,070
If you guys wanted to be by
yourselves, you should've told us

1369
03:00:29,320 --> 03:00:32,058
See! I'm getting told off because
of you

1370
03:00:32,270 --> 03:00:33,263
I've been telling you, let's go

1371
03:00:33,544 --> 03:00:34,035
What?

1372
03:00:34,717 --> 03:00:35,609
Come on

1373
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:04,802
Come on man
